t1_dtg9fcq	-0.525600	*	Not a single person I work with has ever heard of Robert Mueller.      I asked all of them last week (and all of them are Americans, over 35, able to read, and are regularly on Facebook).
t1_dstr8sm	0.357000	*	Then how's that different from being at peace or not being at war? I'm legitimately curious.
t1_dt5ztgj	0.273200	*	Look at all the things you found! Why did they hire mueller when they could have just hired you?! Did your application get rejected? How long have you had your security clearance? So many questions!

t1_dtje6xg	-0.596500	*	You're a fucking classist pig. Of course you'd just assume that if someone is homeless, they're gonna piss and shit all over the bench, and while they're at it throw some syringes on it...

t1_dta5wkt	-0.250000	*	I'm just saying in this instance they were acting like nazis, but you seem to think everyone on the left are a part of antifa.
t1_dttrrp1	-0.064400	*	Just because you get money doesn't mean it's overall great for say, your health.  By your logic late 19th century child labour is ethical and sensible.

t1_dtlkehz	-0.042200	*	I live in Toronto, and I have a feeling the programs are pretty secure here. I think it might just be that you're in a right-leaning area, and I'm in one of the most left-leaning.

t1_dswdjf7	-0.309400	*	Yeah, you probably refer to 'barbarian invasions' in Italian. In German and Dutch for example, those are called 'population movements'. Bit of a different perspective.
t1_dto73ki	0.000000	*	Russia, the US and even China are trying to make claims to our artic. We don't even have the ships to go up there and project force to back up our claims to it. All those others guys do.

t1_dstazh5	0.000000	*	I'm nearly pointing out it was a fake event. If you have enough free time to stalk my reddit history you must be living the sweet life.

t1_dt8uj3v	0.800800	*	It's not so easy to get things done at home, though. I sometimes have the same issue you have at work, but some people who worked from home said it's not all that easy.
t1_dsrcnjl	0.358000	*	Actually, Socrates.
t1_dt3fwde	-0.859100	*	Go fight this war., No.  Sounds noble but only works if everyone on both sides plays along. 
t1_dtg37fk	0.860900	*	Basically the same in Germany, although the effect is less pronounced.
t1_dsyz2qm	-0.867400	*	[According to Wikipedia US is #32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_infant_and_under-five_mortality_rates)  Which still puts it pretty much worst among developed nations.
t1_dsd9jdz	0.000000	*	I dunno, firing squad always seemed like a relatively humane way to execute someone. Especially when compared to beheading or, god forbid, the electric chair.
t1_dt050oh	0.475400	*	You think Israel is only now hitting mainstream? Israel how been the most powerful country in the world for the last 70 years
t1_dtql93r	-0.252300	*	You said it doesnt happen in German media, yet, it happens in German media, I just gave you the most recent one. You want a larger media, how about ZDF, that seems to have a pretty large reach.
t1_dtrxjmt	0.440400	*	Know the diff between manufacture vs engineering.  By your logic,  Apple are great Chinese phones.

t1_dsxbgmt	0.000000	*	> why would these members of Congress want the memo released if it helps him?  Because they're bottom-feeding sycophants from the GOP, obviously. What are you even driving at?
t1_dso43o9	0.264000	*	The first step is to stop trying to appease the belligerents. 
t1_dt6urjg	0.352700	*	That's not how facts work. That's a (faulty) prediction. Not a fact.

t1_dtai01d	0.000000	*	Not the US govt. And also cops can sue people in civil court here btw. Itd be a different story if she was jailed. But shes being sued, thats not the same
t1_dsdx894	-0.143100	*	Then isn't civil forfeiture tantamount to deprivation of free speech?
t1_dt4vxeh	-0.557400	*	> You think energy is the only use for oil?  You must have misread - I didnt say anything like that.  However oil is about 80% used for fuel.

t1_dt2hh85	-0.578900	*	Obama left marijuana largely alone, except for the raids in LA in 2012. Marijuana is still a scheduled drug, changing that would require congressional approval I believe, through legislation.
t1_dsus7q0	-0.636900	*	But this time around the fire has a group of supporters chanting go fire! go! Which is weird because they don't see the ensuing blaze as a necessity for growth, they just like it when things burn. 
t1_dtdpvdl	-0.948600	*	If that were true then we would have found Obama's Kenyan birth certificate and pizza pedo dungeon by now.

t1_dsmt4co	0.000000	*	No idea.   But Ive always been impressed / surprised by your dedication to your national anthem and the flag.  Its unlike anything Ive ever experienced in other Western countries.
t1_dt6jhgy	0.743000	*	Progressive on social issues, yes. Neoliberals represent privatization, unhindered global trade, and corporate interests in every economic way possible. 
t1_dswcn1h	-0.361200	*	Salt water puts out the flames, yes-but then it leaves the land totally unable to grow *anything*. Firefighting with salt water is unintentionally salting the earth.

t1_dticu9m	0.195000	*	Also, it's expensive to cover your ass, especially if you've just been torturing people. Multiply that by all the important people whose asses need to be covered, and there you go.
t1_dss47xi	-0.612400	*	Not claiming police never makes mistakes, but to claim that literal executions are regularly carried out by American police is just dumb and untrue. 
t1_dthhf15	-0.612400	*	So not a literal one
t1_dtmleez	0.648600	*	Die on this hill? Trump pulled out of a voluntary agreement because it wasn't a good enough 'deal' for him. If anything this is exactly how they should respond 
t1_dsudxl8	-0.695600	*	The racist sex offender one. Seriously though, as a non US person it looks pretty bad that people are supporting him. It's like something that would happen in the 3rd world or something.

t1_dssl3zd	-0.510600	*	I too think it is very flawed. I suck at word recollection, mental math calculation, and many other things. I took it after high school and got 158. I think it may focus on the wrong questions.
t1_dtj76rb	0.000000	*	Because mutilation implies a massive anatomical change, usually in a violent and disorganized way. But circumcision is none of those things
t1_dsgr8p3	-0.077200	*	if the costs are high companies will adapt. And why is it so hard to just buy a bag for life ffs?
t1_dt8l0bd	0.000000	*	3rd wave is not very egalitarian. It doesnt include mens issues like child custody or suicide rates
t1_dt1sbwq	-0.970500	*	Yeah but you cannot deny the stock market is rigged against small-time investors. Those who have enough capital to live off their investments often do not work.
t1_dt2xw0b	0.090000	*	You guys meaning Trump supporters. And are you seriously trying to argue that the left (or /r/politics, make up your mind) should be blamed for that idiotic sign which was made by the right?

t1_dsujeyy	0.000000	*	I believe it is spelled Krabappel
t1_dt1dh77	0.133100	*	I thought it was Roosevelt New Deal. It seemed that Roosevelt was so great president that he managed to bring the whole democrat party to the other side, and then republicans filled the hole.

t1_dtwo3ia	-0.811400	*	Words from the party of love, acceptance, tolerance.
t1_dtsxk0s	0.628600	*	I think I am saying that any state that has the ability to project power outside of international law will do so. Israel fits this, as does Russia and the United States. 
t1_dskqral	0.000000	*	I like how you equate Trump Supporter to Neo-Nazi, which is what the driver actually was. Keep doing that. I am sure it won't backfire and alienate regular people who voted for Trump into hating you.
t1_dsv9s9y	0.000000	*	Control alt down
t1_dtkvm4o	0.440400	*	Just because you can name an instance of a justice crossing party lines does not mean the court isn't divided into party lines.
t1_dthnne6	-0.102700	*	> Palestinians want to destroy the State of Israel.  You are really embracing the theory that:  If you are going to lie, lie big.
t1_dsp1bnb	0.440400	*	Let's be honest, the moment anyone sees a ballistic missile inbound to the US or an ally, even if it's non-nuclear, it's the end of the world. Total nuclear annihilation. Mutually assured destruction.
t1_dshwi01	0.000000	*	Uh, the significantly lesser of two evils. Im capable of being critical of two things, without the two things needing to be the same. 
t1_dskmwr4	-0.557400	*	Uh, why so?

t1_dt16pc2	-0.177900	*	What are you facepalming? The definition of autocracy is a system of government by one person with absolute power.
t1_dtnyevm	-0.897900	*	and if the premise is true, that isn't a bad thing  terrorists who murder innocent civilians must be stopped, even by force of arms

t1_dt5vfcv	-0.717800	*	Flynn and Manafort are now just sacrificial lambs?  Furthermore, that's how these things generally work, bottom up. In fact, this already started pretty high.
t1_dt2hvop	0.827100	*	Whenever there is a negative China post someone says  lifted X amount of people out of poverty every time. The wording is so similar every time I'm convinced it is astroturfing.

t1_dt3nsy5	-0.115400	*	Capitalism centers around private ownership of property. It says nothing about free trade. Even traditional American laissez-faire capitalism had tariffs and was economic nationalism.

t1_dsviupl	-0.526700	*	At the time, there was wide spread opposition to the wars in the Middle East. Many countries felt the evidence was dubious, and many didn't want to commit to a war they felt was pointless.
t1_dtefl0m	-0.757900	*	Like clockwork. Once somebody has said your sister is a whore, go and try to convince them you don't have a sister.
t1_dtiqutx	-0.177900	*	Yep, and when challenged similarly on other topics, Obama responded, I have a pen and a phone.    Implying he didn't really want to close GITMO or he failed.    Nothing new.

t1_dsutt42	-0.815600	*	It's a good start, yes. And it's certainly not bad.  The idea that every government action has to be overwhelmingly beneficial is moronic.

t1_dtujxxd	0.128000	*	Yeah but...isn't jury null a part of the law? 
t1_dtxarj2	-0.191000	*	Sounds arcaic (is that the correct term?). Why not just use ID? Without going in to the fact that prisoners can't vote, shouldn't there be a database of prisoners anyway?
t1_dsk014p	0.803800	*	The link on the official app wasn't working so I had to comment so I can find it again on the PC. Was gonna delete this but now I won't.
t1_dsghue5	0.296000	*	I think the world is fucking amazing compared to 30 years ago so clearly the system is working + there's new companies all the time, they just rarely are as good as the established ones.
t1_dtodjll	-0.340000	*	He's not *pro*-Nazi. He just won't say anything *against* them for some curious reason.

t1_dt645pd	0.128000	*	>Religious people are crazy because they're religious.   Plenty of great and good people were religious: Martin Luther King, Kelvin, Rontgen, Marconi, Dyson... were they all crazy?

t1_dt92ejv	0.771700	*	That is like someone in civ placing their troops on someone's border, and then telling them they aren't going to invade.  Take your revisionist history somewhere else.

t1_dt84kbf	0.838100	*	> That's political suicide.  Since nobody has done it, how would you know?  Perhaps they all just agree that having Israel buy our surplus of weapons benefits both countries equally? 
t1_dsp78f7	0.735100	*	Youre just advocating for direct democracy instead of representative democracy. Plenty of places have that in one form of another.

t1_dslyof3	0.778300	*	That would be awesome.  In the meantime we do have Mark Hamill reading Trump's tweets with the voice of the Joker.
t1_dtg6aty	0.585900	*	Right?  I would cry with happiness if my future tax bill was the size of my current *salary*.
t1_dt36m7h	-0.912300	*	Please do. I can argue both sides of the first couple but don't have much to say about the last two.
t1_dt0iqpn	0.835700	*	Less about that, more about maintaining a balance. With Iran and Saudi Arabia are pretty in a mini Cold War. No reason to let the people literally chanting death to America gain control

t1_dt8tqvu	-0.296000	*	I totally understand. I was just curious as I have a lot of family in the area.  I unsubbed from /r/Canada awhile ago, I found the community there  to be too polarized.

t1_dsutcef	0.526700	*	> Please find me a farmer who can afford to pay higher.   Why? That isn't my concern.  Either he can, or he should shut up shop.  It's up to the farmers to demand tariff's so they can compete.

t1_dsm3fln	0.051600	*	You seem to be suggesting that the police in the UK do shoot people perhaps in a racially motivated way.  So I'm curious if you know how many people were shot dead by police in the UK last year.
t1_dsdv1kn	0.000000	*	So they take money out of our economy and send it to another country? Great.
t1_dtbvsqr	-0.612400	*	I actually disagree, taking advantage of the enemies lenience and trust to children is a terrible thing even if you're fighting nazis.

t1_dss55bq	0.258900	*	Moved to Wales in September, don't think I've seen the sun yet. Does it still exist out there? Couldn't tell you, nothing but clouds. 
t1_dt0q1gl	-0.690800	*	Does it matter if they did? The US economy itself was a victim of the wars caused by capitalism (mostly by private actors who profit from the wars).
t1_dtanah6	0.895900	*	So people shouldn't be allowed to call people Nazis? What will we call Trump supporters then.

t1_dticu9m	0.169500	*	Also, it's expensive to cover your ass, especially if you've just been torturing people. Multiply that by all the important people whose asses need to be covered, and there you go.

t1_dtt13tl	-0.599400	*	I think 'the CIA' did know about Iran. Its just that nobody wanted to hear about the 'Iran expert'. The leadership, mainly Dullas wanted this done, so the CIA did it.

t1_dsia359	0.670500	*	Oh you still think we are looking at impeach...no. We are looking for a prison sentence and it is only a matter of time. Be patient. Good things come to those that wait. 
t1_dsx4i8u	0.949400	*	Not being extinct is it's own benefit.  What you're doing is arguing the equivalent of shutting down suicide hotlines.

t1_dtrssb3	0.709600	*	Anyone who is willing to do this just to use their boring website is a sucker.  It would not surprise me if scammers try to track this kind of thing to filter for the most gullible.
t1_dshploe	0.557400	*	Wouldn't have mattered much honestly. You want real change in the country you need control of the legislative branch. 
t1_dsmuqwz	0.000000	*	Trump said we have quite a few F-52s stationed there too, so no worries.

t1_dsomsf1	0.330900	*	My point was that the stock market would not be destroyed. Yes, it would certainly crash. But it would still exist (unless we literally go ballistic and destroy humanity).

t1_dthdrz7	0.000000	*	Well... okay.
t1_dtlc9bh	-0.653100	*	You're quoting total count, and Chinese research output is much larger. China would need to have 20x the retraction rate to beat Italy in total retractions.

t1_dsjnv08	0.609700	*	Only thing he did wrong was backpedal and try to be nice to the Dutch. Should've stuck to the facts. There are no go zones there.

t1_dsva4jo	-0.273200	*	Its like saying Washington state is known for its mountain lions.   Yeah, there are a lot of them there, but it doesn't mean you're going to be jumped by one while you're out for a jog.

t1_dt2ebnn	-0.648600	*	But if Alexander was Macedonian that makes people from Republic of Macedonia his direct decendants. I think this gives them more right to the name Macedonia than the Greeks who are not even Macedonian

t1_dskqggi	-0.757200	*	Cool I guess. But not an argument against any of them.  I'm afraid the old sexist racist homophobic caterwauling lost its effect about 18 months ago. 
t1_dti6xlm	-0.920100	*	Good thing we're on reddit, and not making actual charges then.  
t1_dtqd9nq	0.634400	*	>no way to prevent this, says only country in the world that has more guns than people    There is no simple answer to it, regardless of what you want to believe.

t1_dt5cl3a	-0.659700	*	Come check out the giant phallus right downtown. It's got a restaurant that rotates so you can look down at the city and see absolutely nothing because it's foggy and cold as shit. 
t1_dsdj0gc	0.810000	*	100% agree but Duterte's popularity is legit and he doesn't need fake elections like ~~Erdongan~~ and Putin to stay in power

t1_dtsb8bc	0.750600	*	But outlook and a slew of other collaboration software manage this for you... Hell it's easy to set up widgets that show you your time, and the local time in a few other places. 
t1_dso40h7	0.000000	*	We is a strong word. Panel show hosts might be a slightly more appropriate phrase
t1_dtg5dlm	-0.504000	*	Not a lawyer, but shouldn't it be easy to establish standing here? It's a cut and dry case of the president not doing his job. Nothing subjective about it. 
t1_dsp36tf	-0.205800	*	A quick google search shows they stick to International waters, as they are free to do, so says the Pentagon.  And its mostly intelligence/spy ships.
t1_dskh3dd	-0.119700	*	Give up insisting that the opening of embassies can't be large diplomatic events. It's a bit embarrassing.

t1_dtdrsnl	0.636900	*	Well sure it looks bad. That's why you just pay some random Chinese guy to do it. Seems like making the assassination attempt's origin untraceable would be the easy part of the whole deal. 
t1_dsfr25r	0.000000	*	I mean as stupid as they are, I don't think even the wildest Trumpets would end their statement with 'PEE ON ME GEOTUS DADDY'. I think some of that's on you my dude.
t1_dsq5sis	0.296000	*	That's a weird thing to say Quxe9bec is pretty diversified culturally.
t1_dsel0sp	-0.969800	*	Nothing silly about it. The devastation brought upon Europe by two world wars is unmatched by anything else.
t1_dt1hlyb	-0.510600	*	Sure, but that doesn't have anything to do with your second paragraph being flat out wrong. Even a basic Wikipedia search will prove you wrong on that one.

t1_dsvhlpw	0.000000	*	It's when you enforce it against people from one country but not another because of the majority race of those countries.  That's called racism.

t1_dszv2z7	0.361200	*	They didn't see the need.   Besides, if these people were actually murdered, then the cameras wouldn't have stopped it.

t1_dt36j3w	0.000000	*	Not what I said, but if you pick up a Honduran you don't just throw them in Mexico. If they're going to get killed in Honduras then what is the moral choice?
t1_dshvf16	-0.421500	*	Then Libya as well.  We came, we saw, he died.
t1_dssf05k	0.000000	*	How do you get around the issue of BTC being a competitor to the USD?

t1_dtu0q00	0.542300	*	I just saw the first episode of this show that's about VW and laughed on seeing Mrwebente's comment that they admitted it. They tried covering it up for years after being suspected of it.

t1_dsrcl1i	0.153100	*	I agree the EU is open. But the post above suggested the EU should not offer any deal at all. That is what I am calling a foolish move.

t1_dtnbft2	-0.483600	*	The FBI and the CIA still acknowledge that the report is uncorroborated.  Why do you deny that?  The other stuff you're discussing isn't related to whether or not the report is factual or not.

t1_dss1j3u	0.431000	*	I agree. Kind of. Seems a lot of kids don't grow out of their reluctance to dress appropriately. It may be a sign of mental illness, I suppose. Or, to be fair, extreme toughness.
t1_dtuaa4v	-0.865800	*	I guarantee no Polak would ever think of saying that. Its just not fucking accurate.  I doubt many people will go to jail because of this law unless they literarily want to.

t1_dtdcp5g	0.000000	*	no need to move the goalposts, you clearly stepped into an argument unprepared, and with seemingly heavy CNN bias. not the best plan - T. Stark

t1_dt5wm6x	0.000000	*	Unfortunately not for some. 
t1_dsi78mn	0.735100	*	Of course, but ours never murdered tens of millions of people, as in Russia, China, Cambodia, North Korea, etc. etc. etc.  If you cannot see the difference you need to take a profound moral inventory.
t1_dtd0l74	-0.571900	*	People say catastrophic effects but they never say specifically what. I'm sure we can build stronger structures or adapt.

t1_dtkfffx	0.000000	*	Uh, but, you were.  Your entire civilization is built on carcinogens.  Edit: ...how on earth was this controversial? I think we're pretty agreed that plastics are carcinogenic at this point, surely! 
t1_dsmvf0h	-0.811000	*	Thank you for telling me this.
t1_dtg4gi4	-0.153100	*	Good thing for you unemployment is so low. If you're marketable at all that shouldn't be a problem. 
t1_dsr184f	0.000000	*	We don't actually do that do we? 
t1_dt0ioul	-0.294200	*	That's the funny thing, the US doesn't get a whole bunch of oil from Saudi Arabia. Europe on the other hand, does. 
t1_dt7bck5	0.612400	*	I really can't believe that UK returned Hong Kong.  China didn't deserve it. Look at the shithole they're making it. 
t1_dt4pzyo	-0.249900	*	For whatever reason, weed smoke smell doesn't stick around like tobacco smoke does. If you open up a couple Windows and air the place out for a day or two, the smell will be completely gone
t1_dsdr4df	-0.413700	*	Delayed the nomination for a year 
t1_dsg6dlj	-0.128000	*	Cool

t1_dtjkbz3	0.240600	*	Yeah but at what point do they realize the stupid shit they are doing doesnt actually work? How many generations does it take to realize this?
t1_dt2t35q	-0.177900	*	Well there needs to be a law for something to be illegal
t1_dtfnke9	-0.192600	*	Do you really think Mueller is going to show all of his cards right away? He's flipping guys using lesser charges, which is straight from the playbook. Don't be so naive.
t1_dsrb3o6	0.476700	*	And the EU has already pointed out that they would allow the UK to cancel article 50. Gleefully.
t1_dsztepc	-0.151800	*	Eh, pretty much every country missed the original date.

t1_dsimm9e	0.177900	*	How did neoliberalism fuck them? Seems like youre advocating for unions, which is something republicans openly abhor 
t1_dt81cke	0.025800	*	Unless it's not cheaper... then they could buy
t1_dstbalm	-0.975300	*	You mean the guy who the IDF did not shoot.  The IDF called upon the red cross to investigate his death. 
t1_dsmv7gi	0.000000	*	Wow. You're pathetic. 
t1_dthnn1i	-0.177900	*	Check the history. Its all this account posts. 
t1_dttgs59	0.368000	*	Its not rude if its true, man. I honestly feel the same way. It drives me crazy when people say that America is the greatest nation, because were obviously not.

t1_dthefad	0.153100	*	I wouldn't really have a choice. I don't have the facts of the case.
t1_dslzhf3	0.000000	*	Lol. The very next one down, Fast and Furious is also a falsehood.
t1_dsthxnz	0.669700	*	I doubt that Americans are even close to German looks. Do you really believe that the world thinks of Americans as blonde and blue eyed? That is the German stereotype, chief.
t1_dsjhugz	0.202300	*	It's hilarious how much they go on about Freedom, and how little freedom they have compared to most western european countries.
t1_dtbanyx	-0.542300	*	And a football player on Germany's team is called Boateng. Immigration is a thing that happens.

t1_dtj179z	-0.908100	*	How would that stop anyone from pissing on that bench exactly?  And if anyone pissed on that bench I'd expect it to be some shithead teenager.
t1_dt4z0t2	-0.192600	*	There are always more jobs you can lose.  EDIT: Person below me is deflecting.  Automation compounds the problem, and makes tariffs even *more* justified.
t1_dt54xsg	0.401900	*	Someone doesn't understand that wealth can be created, not just transferred....
t1_dt2ehra	0.440400	*	Well yes the genocide and slavery did help them an awful lot, so maybe thriving on war is the wrong thing to say, thriving on violence in general would be more accurate
t1_dt8tqh2	0.000000	*	We wont get shot though. No guns. 
t1_dt6g3rj	-0.261700	*	isn't pr in huge debt?

t1_dtcqaod	-0.676300	*	But that will be a direct sabotage of one's pleasure. Following the laws of physics and laws of man in vexing enough. Why must one endure non-official made-up codes too?
t1_dsdz7s0	0.700300	*	Aw, I was supportive of you until this comment. Now I understand the downvotes 
t1_dthj7vg	-0.192300	*	Crimes against humanity, of course those are crimes!

t1_dt2ocwk	0.008800	*	I include them because the source said they together had 70%+ of world GDP...no idea what the split was like.  And don't worry, the Chinese are taking back their **Rightful Place** very quickly.
t1_dt5qxul	-0.153100	*	Did you go to China?  Okay well, me as an Asian is telling you I don't want to be white.  So does count for something?  Or do I not count.  White people aren't as amazing as some of you think you are.

t1_dtvmtzj	0.401900	*	A lot of those are PubMed articles, all of which are peer reviewed publications. See all the links with domain ncbi.

t1_dt5xls2	-0.426800	*	For people who support a man who was a registered Democrat longer than he's been a Republican to say the likes of John McCain aren't real Republicans is some kind of warped mind fuck.

t1_dtrbnr2	0.680800	*	til i am a trashy person  Edit: Reddit friends, I appreciate the sentiment, but I am not addicted to heroin lol. I just go on extended walks in Walmart from time to time, which is why I posted this
t1_dsnxf6o	-0.771700	*	In your opinion, are there no shithole countries/places at all, or is it just that Trump was too generalizing?
t1_dt9w713	-0.700300	*	The error is that shrimp on the barbie is the least Australian thing anyone could say right?

t1_dshnk38	-0.095600	*	It's exactly what it is, but they label it some bullshit like right to work and idiots think it's something good
t1_dsutp3t	0.165500	*	I'm black lmao I assure you I don't have a problem with black immigrants, its a fact that 40% of Haitians on this low-skill visa overstay, vs ~1% for all other visas.
t1_dsw9qfx	-0.611500	*	Best thing about Abbott was it was such a whacky ride that you didn't have to worry too much about anything actually coming to fruition. 
t1_dtlj4pw	0.679900	*	Does your friend know there's more than one school in the U.S.?
t1_dtj7b9q	-0.757900	*	Yes they do and most people in their are terrorists very few are falsely convicted so the pros (terrorists being tortured and imprisoned) outweigh the false convictions
t1_dtl6x42	0.510600	*	Zimbabwe gave the farms to politically connect folks who often drove away the existing black workers on the farms and sold off the equipment.
t1_dtmhrbq	0.458800	*	Instructions unclear, built a Geocities website and am somehow communicating via ICQ.
t1_dt79jcg	-0.983300	*	If the two joined, SK would get nukes though right? I have to imagine SK is at least mildly interested in something like that. 
t1_dt5wair	0.796400	*	You literally know nothing about the CIA or the FBI do you
t1_dtwkjlq	0.000000	*	Are you out of your mind? Please cite one instance where these countries tried to INVADE Israel

t1_dsgdjb8	-0.526700	*	You sound fun
t1_dsf8i50	-0.470000	*	They don't need that much to keep them going but a full stomach helps them to focus better. They'll get better grades and not mess around as much in class if they're fed.
t1_dtohui2	-0.981900	*	At least you're honest. The Communists, Bolsheviks, and anti-fascists were incredibly brutal and depraved. Its no wonder the fascists feared them after they saw what happened in Russia.
t1_dtclpoc	0.556200	*	America does not work like the nazis. People are free to do what they want. Even be un-american.
t1_dtou2vj	0.113400	*	A lot of republicans do not like Trump. I'll take the evidence of bias that they've recovered that literally has people talking about insurance policies against Trump becoming president. 
t1_dtqjq8q	0.000000	*	Except citing reflectivity is an indication you think heat levels will be reduced. They won't be. They'll be increased. 
t1_dtvg3va	-0.611100	*	Because Im choosing random laws from your way of life that I can easily use to generalise you and your beliefs. You dont like it when the shoe is on the other foot do you?
t1_dsen8if	0.000000	*	I'd settle for a Turing test. 
t1_dthdvwe	0.128000	*	Do you think as a man, I should have the right to show my penis in public, erect or soft? 
t1_dt34n86	0.000000	*	so you are saying a big part is the fault of the people in 3rd world countries?
t1_dssj1h0	-0.064400	*	What the fuck. I can't believe that's a subreddit. I mean, I can, but I wish I didn't.
t1_dsm98y1	-0.493900	*	Maybe if Venezuela was ever actually socialist you would make sense.
t1_dthlv1i	0.726900	*	> and blackhole social media  so when are you gonna do that?
t1_dsdt0zn	0.000000	*	Half the people here are angry and confused while the other half are lying. Never trust a comment to be anything more than someone's deeply flawed opinion 
t1_dsgho2j	0.636900	*	Unless a bank owes Obama millions I'm not sure they're the same thing. But I'm also a fucking idiot. 
t1_dsow54c	-0.640400	*	Yup. And destructive power scales exponentially with megatonnage. A 100 megaton bomb would be incredibly devastating.   Edit: nvm; sounds like I'm wrong. Nonetheless, 100 MT is still a powerful bomb. 
t1_dt1jt9y	0.893200	*	Fucking love navy fed
t1_dta8u87	0.949700	*	Yeah especially now that he can't open his mouth without attacking or insulting someone. He is a national embarrassment and he has made the US the laughing stock of the world. 
t1_dsjhlx5	-0.506300	*	Is libel/slander a crime in your country?  Cuz that whole burned politician thing was 100% an outright boldfaced lie. 
t1_dtff55z	0.000000	*	A house team from those states could probably beat them. US Women's team routinely loses warm up games to HS teams from those states. Granted, very good teams, but HS boys none the less.    
t1_dt8gs02	0.359500	*	Thanks for confirming your presence so quick.
t1_dspovxu	0.510300	*	A dance floor needs to carry insane weight. Like putting 400lbs in each spot a person can stand. 
t1_dt2ltv5	0.612400	*	Yes, once in positive and once on negative   Example; I like apple  1 2 3 4 5 6 7   ..... I don't like apple  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 
t1_dsxtxjt	0.493900	*	> I mean it got hit by an asteroid and life still went on.  Yeah but I'm sure that hurt a bit.  *If I was the planet and I had a choice*, I'd prefer to not get hit in the face by an asteroid.
t1_dsh0cq3	-0.776600	*	You know, the weird thing about truth telling journalists? They don't bias their reporting out of spite. 
t1_dtfvqrk	-0.502000	*	No, you just don't understand English as well as you think you do.
t1_dsi78zk	-0.773300	*	Yeah. That should be allowed.  That company will go out of business faster than you can say free market.
t1_dt2xkhy	0.493900	*	Holy shit, I got goosebumps.
t1_dsvpv60	0.000000	*	Oh really? But how this what-about-Czechoslovakia is related to Sweden?
t1_dtbeu2c	0.000000	*	Except it doesn't work that way. It's a false equivalence.
t1_dsju3da	-0.361200	*	If you admit that it worked in the long run, then why are you against it happening a second time. I'm personally fine suffering a bit for my kids.
t1_dsmbi0k	0.340000	*	A seller will absolutely take a briefcase full of cash. I bought my first two houses that exact way. 
t1_dso1zy1	0.202300	*	People do often talk about an unwritten constitution, and we have constitutional experts that try to parse out the sort of unwritten expectations from the assembly of laws and common practice.
t1_dtorr4x	0.273200	*	Yep
t1_dtiikpu	0.000000	*	That's brilliant, but I think a few pushups would probably do the same job.  Honestly I think he'd probably keel over after eating a couple more big macs than he's used to.
t1_dslxyfe	0.000000	*	I believe they tried hard to get a better plan, but faced too much opposition from Republicans. 
t1_dss6dr9	0.411800	*	That's awful, tbh.
t1_dsmmhqn	0.296000	*	We need to see that hair first.
t1_dtnztwc	0.273200	*	Know what they say about invading Russia in the winter? Imagine that but with people that look and sound exactly like you.
t1_dsiyo5x	0.177900	*	Yes and MSNBC is nothing even remotely close to the scale of Fox News. 
t1_dsusrd8	-0.271600	*	Weird how people have been making this argument for over a hundred years and while immigration has never gone away, *this scenario has never happened*. It's just more anti-Union, anti-immigrant BS
t1_dskegly	0.474900	*	So there is another side to the story of Putin not allowing anyone to seriously challenge him in the elections? Is it a lie made up by the western media?
t1_dsipdp0	0.000000	*	Every pakistanis I ever saw looked just like an Indian, but I know there are some ethnicities with lighter skin colors like Hazara and Pashtuns
t1_dtkbqok	0.860700	*	And be the ones exploiting it to make more money. Thank God we at least have a few Bill Gates types in this world. 
t1_dt5axgr	0.232300	*	You can literally walk down Yonge st smoking a joint and no one, cops included will give a fuck. It has been like that for years now.
t1_dtdm4y4	0.202300	*	It's one thing chucking out random shit, but chucking out sleeping bags in mid winter can have fatal consequences.  The council should not be putting peoples' lives at risk.   
t1_dswaf9d	0.381800	*	Then what's all the fuss about? Honestly, I was just about to start shipping Dasani donations to them...
t1_dtbvv35	-0.049800	*	Ever taken a college chemistry class? I learned enough to be dangerous. I'd probably get myself blown up messing around with it though. 
t1_dstlll9	-0.296000	*	The ignorant statement actually is to say that one knows about Pizza because one is a New Yorker.  I reacted to that... but well...
t1_dsdzfga	0.000000	*	What does capitalism have to do with government officials giving wealth and power to their friends and family?
t1_dt0unk1	0.000000	*	Just looked outside, the sky is gray.
t1_dtfdlys	-0.440400	*	Well, my answer to the other dudes question would be the same to this one.
t1_dsgsc4u	0.361200	*	I didn't say it was.  Just pointing out that your idea that you can't mention someone in a book without speaking with them directly is asinine.
t1_dt6uxdy	0.571900	*	Maybe it the first turn. But in the second turn he wins all the left votes, and people more moderate who cold vote for bolsonaro over lula (one extreme over the other), might prefer the moderate. 
t1_dtqjtle	-0.296000	*	Alot of bullshit can be argued. A land dispute between governments is not a matter of perspective, it's a matter of public policy.
t1_dtjqe67	0.693600	*	There's investing heavily and then there's subsidized to the point of being able to sell at below cost.  They were doing the latter.
t1_dtmpi9q	0.000000	*	How many did? And which ones did?  Seems most who left were pro-Batista reactionaries and plantation owners. 
t1_dsx9rko	0.273200	*	That is communism. The end goal of socialism is communism but in socialism the means of production is owned by the state. Idk why its so hard for you people to understand that.
t1_dsotx6t	0.000000	*	Have a source? I feel like Zuckerberg is a tool but a source proving me wrong would be neat.  Edit: I *guess* the guy is aight as far as rich people go...
t1_dt0soar	0.444900	*	Live in the US.  Could say it anywhere you want.  Altthough, suddenly saying it in a work meeting or the drive thru at McDonald's might get you some weird looks.
t1_dsom5k0	0.000000	*	He didn't choke on a pretzel.   He had a mild stroke. That stupid bush thing didn't happen until after he choked on a pretzel   Look at his speeches before that 
t1_dtaeqv0	0.673800	*	Ahhh don't ride your bike drunk! I almost killed myself that way once.
t1_dtavdtk	0.000000	*	It's rumored because Putin was married to when was born and isn't mother.

t1_dt334we	-0.033000	*	Yeah it's unprofessional and childish but again not that big a deal. 
t1_dsdzl1c	-0.982200	*	All those countries have declared war on Israel so it's not surprising Israel wouldn't allow travel to its enemies. 
t1_dsf7rrt	0.000000	*	Well you didn't refute it. White men are coddled by society and more likely to apply for things they don't have qualifications for. See I can invent a backstory too
t1_dsvn7k2	-0.460600	*	Yeah, it's not like the Democrats have a track record of trying to restrict gun rights or anything.
t1_dtde42c	0.000000	*	A Luigi board?
t1_dtd9zbx	0.000000	*	This is not an acceptable reply.  No one will take you seriously if you keep saying things like this.  I'm interested in what you have to say, but you need to post some evidence.
t1_dsi6lg0	0.571900	*	Yes.  Many Trump opponents have lost their fucking mind.  1 million of them walked around Washington with Pussies on their heads and they hold rallies to scream at the clouds.
t1_dsne1en	0.000000	*	I mean when you just made up a false dichotomy sure. There is more than neutral and extreme left and right. 
t1_dt777ql	0.564700	*	Well shit
t1_dt7ll5x	-0.950900	*	lol, maybe it's pedobot   edit: jesus christ just checked his history
t1_dsl4on3	0.571900	*	> Run to your country where you can't move up the economic ladder child.   https://www.upi.com/1-in-85-Norwegians-is-a-millionaire/25081184205756/

t1_dt6kxmi	-0.401900	*	I have done so, for both Germany and my own country
t1_dttxwkk	0.612400	*	Then it is a bad article, because that was what the women were marching about.  I just pulled the first one off the top, these marches only happened a week or two ago this should be common knowledge.
t1_dse9dme	0.510600	*	I don't know man, have you ever met a CW5?

t1_dsxlxq1	-0.931900	*	Of course the Turks have done nothing to the kurds!  They are perfectly behaved angels and very very good at keeping it out of the news.

t1_dseagkh	0.356600	*	Considering that their nukes dont really pose a threat to America directly now, I dont think we have the right to sentence South Koreans to death. 
t1_dt1aja3	0.452200	*	The US supports and funds Saudi Arabia who have funded and helped ISIS to topple their enemies. The US might not have directly assisted ISIS, but their lapdogs certainly have.
t1_dsoiw76	0.000000	*	I mean, we do know the USAF built fighters that could carry nuclear tipped air-to-air missiles. The notion that nukes are strategic only came a while later

t1_dtiw1dn	0.226300	*	Likely because many homeless are mentally ill and/or drug addicts. Improving services for those two conditions would go a long way to lowering rates of homelessness. 
t1_dtrlmqg	0.053100	*	The same reason Costco constantly reshuffles their stores. It keeps you around longer to be marketed to and the random assortment of data feels fresh as the new is merged with the old.

t1_dttemti	-0.419000	*	Biggest irony is that they miss how this has good impact on their life also. When people get by without robbing, they do less robbing. 
t1_dszjqiv	0.186400	*	Nonsense, the only aired anime that don't get official releases in the west now are children's shows.  Between Crunchyroll, Amazon and Netflix we see it all.

t1_dslzos9	-0.102700	*	A person who got 100% of their news from the Daily Show would be an idiot, but they'd still be *far* more informed than a person who got 100% of the news from Fox News.

t1_dtvha3b	-0.310900	*	Id say the difference is that cows and pigs are eaten,and their skin is turned into a jacket,or gloves. A lion gets shot and his head mounted on a wall,for a rich asshat to boast about

t1_dtvmcul	0.000000	*	That makes it endemic? A guy married a dog in India does that make it endemic? No its not a huge problem in Pakistan. However it does fit into your bigoted narrative.

t1_dtik6z6	-0.361200	*	Trying to say the constitution doesnt apply (it does) is trying to find a reason to make it not illegal. It also violates thr Geneva convention and id wager other international laws/agreements. 
t1_dtdbuuh	-0.670500	*	First of all, he never said anything about conquering Ukraine, that is a lie. And he didn't support Crimea either, before you say it. For insulting Georgians he apologized and admitted it was wrong.

t1_dsezuvw	0.510600	*	It translates just fine, entire books have been written sarcastically. Lots of sarcastic comments on Reddit are made every day without needing to ruin the whole point by using the tag.

t1_dt7gv9n	0.631000	*	Explain your statement please.
t1_dtganck	-0.251600	*	I think there are a lot more decisions of his to criticize than avoiding a long drawn out court case involving a child soldier. For example, resolutely breaking his electoral reform promise.
t1_dt3xkol	0.077200	*	Its in the cistern behind you. Dont drink from the bowl!
t1_dt9z8p5	0.000000	*	You're defending her by quoting her saying they should've profiled someone for his haircut? That actually makes her seem significantly worse.
t1_dt8vcks	0.421500	*	That's not a British passport 
t1_dt5vfcv	-0.897900	*	Flynn and Manafort are now just sacrificial lambs?  Furthermore, that's how these things generally work, bottom up. In fact, this already started pretty high.
t1_dsmrrk7	0.624900	*	Don't act like you don't know exactly what kind of folks are active in t_d. With your head that deep in the sand you might suffocate.
t1_dsh0cq3	-0.144100	*	You know, the weird thing about truth telling journalists? They don't bias their reporting out of spite. 
t1_dsl2pg8	0.577700	*	This is nitpicky question, but isn't a house considered private property, and thereby abolished, under communism?
t1_dsno6ti	0.525600	*	They'd prefer it that way
t1_dtb1wlu	0.000000	*	You do realize if it's $1.5 billion out of $6 billion then it's 25% of their income.... Right?  So I'm guessing they got their numbers from the same place you did.

t1_dsydl8j	0.669600	*	Breaking character here but isn't the popular opinion that the sequel was shit? I heard the sequel was shit, at least; that's why I felt okay about not having seen it yet.

t1_dtf516m	0.000000	*	One of Trumps first acts was to ban immigration from Muslim countries. Stop defending this horrible person. Im glad you support her but our cunt of a president does not.

t1_dt2lvgj	0.000000	*	It's always been my understand (through what I've been taught) that the Bible is meant to be true; but not fact. Basically, it is what happened; but it's not meant to be 100 percent literal.
t1_dt6ycxm	0.599400	*	South Koreans would go from having one of the most developed countries to a very poor country. Also, by your definition, only a handful of nations are sovereign.
t1_dt2igoy	-0.509300	*	You say that like those rash tweets weren't about *nuclear fucking war*.

t1_dt8zwmd	0.457600	*	The pornstar almost certainly has more credibility that Trump does.  He's literally the most prolific liar I'm aware of.  Worse, half the time he isn't lying he's wrong.
t1_dswn6y8	0.000000	*	> being basically they feel that way.  That's all pretty much any political debate ends up being, these are subjective matters.

t1_dt4xtkh	-0.176400	*	That's why we can't have nice things. Imagine a world where an ISDS didn't get abused and corrupted.
t1_dtdvux2	-0.153100	*	He asked a question about US politics, so I didnt bother stating far left compared to americans.   Also trump is considered center right, based on what hes done so far.
t1_dt8u6lf	0.000000	*	Yep. Unconditionally, and under presidents from both major political parties. 
t1_dslfolt	0.458800	*	They also tested drugs on and tortured their own citizens. They are evil.
t1_dt2oasl	-0.432200	*	Unfortunately, living in a Catholic country, not treating religious texts literally doesnt stop their actions being heavily influenced by superstition.

t1_dt5zxmi	0.000000	*	Thats likely because the king of Commies is now in the whitehouse and doesnt use the term himself...
t1_dt8wpio	0.548300	*	Obama didnt get a million dollar loan from his dad, since he wasnt a millionaire like Trumps Dad. He also didnt inherit a million dollar company like Trump did.

t1_dsqahl0	0.458800	*	No.
t1_dt3ps3s	0.381800	*	a lot of comedians and actors **out of work.**  I was saying, logically, it can't be POTUS since POTUS is a job. I was just pointing out the logical fallacy for fun.

t1_dtnkkvp	0.439100	*	Policy and law are made and interprited by those in power. Just because the liberal court at the time found Rowe v Wade to be acceptable at the time does not mean it could not be overturned one day.
t1_dsdggrg	0.296000	*	Literally meth cut with caffeine
t1_dsglpoc	-0.340000	*	That may be true, but I think for some like myself being asked that question each time encourages the right kind of thinking, and then leads you towards a different kind of behaviour.
t1_dsldsan	0.877900	*	Weve got Pia Kjxe6rsgaard and Inger Stxf8jberg. Theyd rip trump to shreds. Hes a dope smoking hippie compared to those two.

t1_dtx5d34	0.102700	*	I doubt either Putin or Trump, nor their advisors, would be willing to bring life to an end over Estonia. Putin has been fighting a war against Ukraine and we've done very little.

t1_dsmlk1w	0.000000	*	what?
t1_dtik5g5	0.585900	*	I don't know what you mean by awareness and action to be honest.  They already caught the guy and the video didn't have to be on the internet for them to do so.  They knew his name.   
t1_dtxg77r	0.187700	*	They'd be forced to. That or fall apart completely. 
t1_dtwuddg	0.979300	*	Give me a few sources then. A country isn't called Paradise of the Jews for no reason.
t1_dttmaaf	-0.341200	*	Argentina has universal healthcare and getting a work permit is trivial (you only need a clean criminal record). 
t1_dt3prw4	0.557400	*	Facepalm. Most Israelis are not white. U0001f926 They are mizrachis (middle-eastern).

t1_dsut89f	-0.102700	*	I hope you don't consider yourself left-wing, since you spend your time mocking the underprivileged for not being as educated as your elite ass online.

t1_dtqufqc	0.510600	*	Then why don't American conservatives have proportional representation on Reddit?   Reddit is mostly aimed towards college aged liberal males. 
t1_dstsjhr	0.773300	*	he was fucking her while he was president and she worked for him. matters a hell of a lot more than trump banging random women as a private citizen.

t1_dttcvn6	0.000000	*	Doctors make a shit ton of money in the UK and I'm sure they do in Canada as well. No need to go to America and feed into their broken system.
t1_dt7dve3	-0.284600	*	Although countries without nuclear energy *also* may have said ability.  It's just much harder to disguise your enrichment machines without an energy program to justify their existence.

t1_dsvujke	0.000000	*	If they are linked, then importing poverty also means importing violent crime. Maybe we shouldn't do that then.

t1_dt049zt	-0.984200	*	thanks for restating what I already said. The cops never should have said on day one that it was a murder-suicide. They fucked up. bringing in homicide days later is better late than never.

t1_dsowglw	0.273200	*	So outlaw alcohol for everyone if you believe it. Its not the prohibition if alcohol that is being challenged hereit is the institutionalized discrimination against women.

t1_dtnylvp	0.000000	*	His buddies? He's done nothing but pile tariffs on us and blow up trade deals and pull out of Paris since he was elected. He's a damn menace to Canada.
t1_dsd9jdz	-0.949500	*	I dunno, firing squad always seemed like a relatively humane way to execute someone. Especially when compared to beheading or, god forbid, the electric chair.

t1_dtea04y	-0.296000	*	There's no Rojava Kurdistan just like there's no Palestine or Tibet. No State exists concretely; it is recognized, or not. But Israel has recognized it if I'm correct. And for the YPG, it does exist.
t1_dtfd2hd	0.153100	*	Oh, this shit again. FGM and MGM in their most severe forms are completely equivalent. You're being intellectually dishonest if you somehow try to elevate FGM above MGM.

t1_dtvmcul	0.000000	*	That makes it endemic? A guy married a dog in India does that make it endemic? No its not a huge problem in Pakistan. However it does fit into your bigoted narrative.

t1_dt5wexi	0.859100	*	I never understand when people use these approval ratings as solid proof of anything.  Not that many people actually get polled.

t1_dslu10w	-0.983400	*	Between the USA and Spain, yeah.  But the US ranks 48th in suicide rate.  Twelve European nations have higher suicide rates than the US, including those socialist Utopias of Sweden and Belgium.
t1_dsx8k4q	0.000000	*	So one of the things he said was correct. But to say Canada is geographically, ethnically and culturally homogenous? That's just totally false.

t1_dslyrin	-0.762200	*	The problem isn't that places are shitholes. The problem is that Trump thinks that being from a shithole should disqualify you from coming to the U.S..   Edited for clarification.

t1_dso19u4	0.899600	*	Sadiq Khan went to one of the worst universities in the country. There's different forms of intelligence. People good with words aren't good with maths a lot of the time, and vice versa.

t1_dtiikpu	-0.318200	*	That's brilliant, but I think a few pushups would probably do the same job.  Honestly I think he'd probably keel over after eating a couple more big macs than he's used to.

t1_dtkti0r	0.855500	*	A solution exists,  but countries would rather placate China than do it.   So the root of the problem is that the world doesn't actually care about genocide, so terrorism is the only way to fight it.

t1_dt91eig	0.000000	*	I'm not sure if I follow. Are you saying 10 people should have the same amount of sway in an election as 330 million others?  Because no, they shouldn't.
t1_dt86fbc	-0.659700	*	Because they aren't a delivery service. Most stations will offer to have a motor vehicle towed to you at your cost and will at the very least notify you when it is recovered.   
t1_dtd3h8y	0.458800	*	The only consequence is that we slow down productivity so that other countries can catch up. It is the opposite of competitiveness. Which is why it is stupid.

t1_dsmvd1a	0.000000	*	SBX, the cornerstone for America's entire Pacific ABM defense grid. Basically a supermassive radar system mounted on top of an oil rig. Turn it on near land and all birds within a 500m radius perish.

t1_dttg97t	-0.577900	*	But the public option would be too good and drive away all the competition. We can't have the superior product beat inferior products. How is that honoring capitalism? /s
t1_dsm4g1t	0.367400	*	What is that supposed to mean? 
t1_dtefwem	-0.698000	*	How does that disprove anything I said?   I already said he is alleged to have abused 14 year olds.  ...Unless you *still* don't know what a paedophile is even after I told you to look it up?

t1_dt5yfmy	0.273200	*	I respect your observations but what does having good priorities have to do with freedom?
t1_dsrcl1i	0.933700	*	I agree the EU is open. But the post above suggested the EU should not offer any deal at all. That is what I am calling a foolish move.  
t1_dsxmap2	-0.168000	*	In n Out does their own sourcing and distribution.  If you're spending $3 on lunch, it's the way to go.

t1_dtjbwwh	0.969500	*	Right, some religions use psychedelic drugs...but that never stopped the US DOJ and the DEA from banning them and sending people off to prison though.
t1_dtanlyz	0.000000	*	No, and that's not what I said.  I feel like you're being intentionally obtuse.  Trump Receives Mixed Reception at Davos would have been a more accurate headline.
t1_dtd1h8o	0.000000	*	Is that correspondence dinner a Obama thing or a presidential thing? If so, when does Trump do one?

t1_dtqt81h	-0.329100	*	I'm asking why you don't hold the US to the same standards, because you're obviously not boycotting US companies, because you're on reddit.  Why don't you boycott all US companies?

t1_dt2ksfe	0.200600	*	Considering that only 26.3% of americans voted for trump, I wouldnt say that 33% is inconsequential, and most certainly not virtually non-existent.  Virtually non-existent is, like, 0.3%.  
t1_dt6fy2a	-0.917000	*	He also undid a lot of what JP2 did with regards to Vatican II, especially when it came to the poor. He was very anti-Liberation Theology. Francis is a Jesuit, an order rooted in social justice. 
t1_dsfef0h	-0.296000	*	Maybe, but it was conveniently timed to look so.
t1_dtm36b6	0.708800	*	You remind me of my late grandfather. He had several strokes that affected the way he walked, yet he always made fun of himself. He loved being called Frankenstein.

t1_dtr93e7	0.226300	*	Are they ethnically Hellenistic; no. So they have no claim to the name Macedonia and the (here's the important part) the territories associated with it. That's the core arguement correct.
t1_dt9vll0	0.000000	*	You don't need to have a humanities degree to be sensible though. Nazi in current culture is used too freely but accusing security for just doing their job is idiotic at best and racist at worst.

t1_dtq57ui	0.659700	*	Definitely lean right, better they're no where near as bad as you make it seem. This is reddit after all, a very liberal place so its to be expected the majority wouldn't watch or like Fox.

t1_dsmc073	0.467800	*	So when you see a by line on an article from someone you generally disagree with, does the text like...turn into a different language? Or are you just deciding to be intentionally ignorant?

t1_dsfj7xx	0.856100	*	US definitely wants to see North Korea resolved, what are you talking about. Thats another communist nation down, and a loyal US ally bordering China.

t1_dt0hrpy	0.000000	*	That's a much lesser amount of power centralization, corporation versus country.  A corrupt corporation will go bankrupt and cease to have any power at all. Example: Enron.

t1_dsf3vbx	0.778300	*	You don't need quid pro quo to have a conflict of interest...
t1_dtjddva	-0.599400	*	Read a post saying that 9 out of 100.000 babies die from the procedure, it was on here so not sure how valid, but even if it was one in a million it would still be too many.

t1_dshxpnz	-0.693500	*	I have no side. I am not alt right and I am not even American. Your problem is that you too blindly invested in being on a side to have any rational discussion on this

t1_dtvbzg0	-0.359700	*	I donate to a variety of charities, several of which support conservation. my employer matches our contributions up to a certain point so it's double the impact.

t1_dtoyfwj	0.177900	*	The whole point is that it is a moot comparison. Try googling it for yourself, or maybe find some historian comparing the Asyrians with WWII's Japan.
t1_dtaazx4	0.177900	*	Jesus, is it possible to be more sanctimonious when trying to rally people to you side?
t1_dsq6g1s	-0.027600	*	You realize the whole Fucking point is that its not about race?

t1_dtgkxu4	0.308900	*	7 years?
t1_dt8zgub	-0.969700	*	You don't have to prove shit. Those suits don't EVER go to court. You just have to be sufficiently lawyered up to force an out of court settlement.

t1_dtuov6v	0.000000	*	If Trump shit in your mouth would you be talking about how Obama would have if given the chance?

t1_dt5xqkd	-0.120500	*	And getting no where with that tact. Not a single media outlet takes it seriously. But they have to keep up appearances.
t1_dsiyq9s	-0.623200	*	So a woman getting raped doesn't know people are walking the streets?
t1_dstnvsw	-0.863000	*	>It means she intentionally lied.  And what evidence do you have that this happened?

t1_dtewlzn	-0.291100	*	You missed one other criterion sadly - hasn't already served two terms as president.
t1_dtbkkil	-0.771700	*	Unless I misunderstood your point, it was that this action promotes an American military presence on the Russian border.      In all honesty if my comment is misguided feel free to tell me why.
t1_dsm0a19	0.361200	*	China is a country with a brutal history with Japan. If you mistake a person from china as Japanese, depending on where they are from and their age, you might be getting smacked over it.
t1_dt4h759	0.756300	*	The USA isn't now considering Iraq as part of their territory.  Your comparison sucks.
t1_dtvpai7	0.000000	*	I am going to have to disagree with you. Not only do the animals get eaten(by law), the money paid by the hunter is used for conservation.
t1_dtrkvx9	0.000000	*	Yeah, that guy probably only goes to /r/LateStageCapitalism or something to get his numbers. 
t1_dsr0ntb	0.077200	*	I assume he's talking about historical places pertaining to the US, not North America. US is formally less than 300 years old.
t1_dsqjb1t	0.000000	*	> For fake crimes, probably even a small amount would be considered a huge fraction, since most people do not expect people to make such fake allegations.   What kind of fucking logic is this?

t1_dszezd6	0.000000	*	I just remembered I made a snapchat video with them while at the bar. Here's [proof](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhvBk1OF1TE&feature=youtu.be) lol.

t1_dsurlxh	-0.413700	*	I urge you to take some college level economics classes and actually pay attention. You will learn the difference between organic inflation and forced inflation. Organic inflation isnt a bad thing. 
t1_dsih5xl	0.000000	*	Don't forget: the aca is different from obamacare. We've seen that one a ton. Especially since trump paid lip service to universal health care a few times. 
t1_dsx8nmh	0.892200	*	I'm pro choice. Who am I forcing my views on?
t1_dsq01lg	0.688200	*	I guess with taxes, Im not sure though I never supported ir anyway.  The tuition fees should be reduced though, it is really unacceptable what they charge
t1_dtm2u19	0.273200	*	If you live in a first world country the likelyhood you reach 120 is probably better than it has ever been at any point before.
t1_dsgj5xo	0.350600	*	What do you mean didn't use the help of government? Using governments to get an advantage is perfectly fine capitalistic behaviour.
t1_dsdnh35	0.226300	*	But Trump is a conman, if he thought he could profit by losing I think he'd do it.  ... but I don't know, he's crazy, trying to read into his motives is probably futile. 
t1_dtvu0qk	-0.177900	*	> Ben Shapiro is possibly the worst source for anything ever. He speaks literal shit nearly 100% of the time.   Proceeds to link a dirty looking hipster doing a Youtube blog.

t1_dt7znzc	-0.526700	*	> And what is with tuff like this?   It gets covered up has the mine moves past and turned back into usable land?
t1_dtx3b3p	0.250000	*	China would charge for passage through the SCS. All your Hello Kitty backpacks would cost more. 
t1_dt62h5e	0.000000	*	> who;s asking for blood?  How many times do I have to hear and read on this site of the thousands of posts daily calling for the impeachment of Trump?
t1_dt1rzzg	0.000000	*	No, they don't. Having money in safe investments is a loss in the long run. 
t1_dt4snh8	-0.897900	*	IDK how it works with foreigners/expats, but you have to keep in mind that a liability insurance is mandated by law for dutch citizens, just like our health insurance.
t1_dsmclyy	0.493900	*	It's almost like people get triaged and get priority based on the seriousness of the injury/illness...
t1_dskniap	0.553000	*	lolno  We have state-subsidized Vitamin D supplements for that.
t1_dsgl126	0.128000	*	So you think we could not have a military at all and there'd be no global repercussions for that? lol

t1_dtm983r	0.000000	*	It doesn't suggest false. That's what it doesn't suggest.
t1_dt75o4f	0.000000	*	Personally I would rather that they be split into separate parties that then negotiate coalitions out in the open. Right now the Republican party consists of a coalition that is relatively opaque.
t1_dsoav2w	0.670500	*	Great coming from a group that gets mad at facts and yells racism at stating the facts. It's what assholes do I suppose. 
t1_dttbzxq	-0.709600	*	No doubt about it: the US is huge. However, it advantageous to the powers that be that not many leave the the shores of America.  
t1_dtge94z	-0.818100	*	Impeachment enforced how?  He's ignoring a 419-3, 98-2 bill that he signed.  He would absolutely be willing to ignore articles of impeachment.  
t1_dsewdaj	0.765000	*	Extremely easy? Have you tried to buy a fucking pair of jeans with 100% cotton that looks good?
t1_dtnfzgu	-0.964300	*	A person sent crazy messages online to another person??!! Wow.  How relevant.    /s

t1_dtj852e	0.000000	*	Yeah but they have their male priviledge going for them, which is nice /s. It reminds me of [this.]( https://imgur.com/gallery/8ZhoV)

t1_dt8sfzq	-0.969800	*	Be that as it may, taking their reporting as fact when they cannot prove their claims is foolish.   I trust verifiable proof, not reliable sources.
t1_dsen8if	0.000000	*	I'd settle for a Turing test. 
t1_dt0kzi1	0.000000	*	Not really, it's the majority of Turks abroad, especially in Germany. They or their parents came here because they couldn't find decent jobs in Turkey.
t1_dtg4gi4	-0.882800	*	Good thing for you unemployment is so low. If you're marketable at all that shouldn't be a problem.

t1_dtohz8b	0.000000	*	The funny part is that particular flag was never the flag of the Confederate army. 
t1_dt9xbe5	0.226300	*	I had the pleasure of chatting with an American once, we talked about all kinds of stuff, including history and the reunification of Germany. He only asked:what reunification?
t1_dtj8g5g	-0.241100	*	It is not and should not be 24 countries' responsibility if two countries fail to protect their borders. That's ridiculous. 
t1_dskfoia	0.000000	*	But would he really be assassinated in Britain? America has guns. What are Brits going to do, lob sausage rolls at him?

t1_dsdrsjt	0.323900	*	What I'm saying is if people elect better people in local and state elections, after a few terms some of them will run for national seats. It starts at the bottom 
t1_dsq3kap	0.000000	*	Most things in life are simple.
t1_dtln59r	0.226300	*	Fair enough, and I'm no naval warfare expert, but railguns also have longer range, as well enabling ships not to carry a magazine full of vessel-obliterating charges, right?
t1_dtq8dxe	0.000000	*	Thank fuck. But still. Means Tory MPs will be given a 3 line whip on Brexit votes. 
t1_dt7pmz1	0.974100	*	Justice also matters, for the millions and millions who've died. Letting them walk would never happen. There would be massively violent protests. 
t1_dsml5po	-0.361200	*	Michael Malloy aka the durable Michael Malloy aka Iron Mike Malloy. Primus did a short instrumental song called [You Can't Kill Michael Malloy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lR0vTJoVT8o)

t1_dt8sf0q	0.000000	*	We hid it somewhere in Russia, & it's only accessible during winter.   Good luck.
t1_dt313fy	0.510600	*	Literally the first one in the video is before that. That's just his way of mocking people. He wasn't making fun of the reporter for being disabled. Don't turn it into something it's not.

t1_dt5qyrv	0.000000	*	Come on, spit it out. Call me comrade or talk about how Putin's dick needs sucking. Stop dancing around it and explain how some dude in *New Zealand* is actually a Russian shill. 
t1_dt7gv4n	-0.487400	*	Idk man... How many other of your colonies successfully rebelled and gained independence before the US? And how many after?

t1_dtqfzr0	0.714900	*	Islamic extremists are rigntwing?  Youre delusional. Youre nuts.  Leftwing terrorism is the second most deadly form of terrorism in europe. Seperatism being first.
t1_dtkv95y	0.730200	*	I would say the clitoral hood would be more equivalent to the foreskin, since the head of the penis is equivalent to the clitoris.
t1_dtn07f2	0.624900	*	I mean doctors are trained in science and medicine. Nurses are closer to the average person not trained those fields, only because they didnt go through the rigorous fucking education we did.

t1_dte8fg7	-0.680800	*	Lol why? We will never give up Israel and there is nothing the world can do about it. Nuclear weapons have cemented our country as permanent on the map.

t1_dtakjka	-0.966600	*	Am I wrong though? They're fuckig dumb. It's a fact. By voting for trump they proved to the whole world they love racism and homophobia and rape. That's fucking dumb. 
t1_dsva4jo	-0.743200	*	Its like saying Washington state is known for its mountain lions.   Yeah, there are a lot of them there, but it doesn't mean you're going to be jumped by one while you're out for a jog.

t1_dta5wwt	-0.318200	*	It's a bad joke though. That joke only works if the speaker says literally X and X is used in a non-literal way
t1_dtms243	0.854300	*	That's not true at all. I recommend looking at the municipal elections going on right now. You don't have to be a member of the PCC to be elected. 
t1_dszwuta	-0.841500	*	If it's a matter of general public interest, then it should be up to the government to provide said securities, which will in turn infringe on the billionaire's autonomy.

t1_dsmkpzh	0.863500	*	Oh nice. So that means what exactly? 
t1_dsz1mzn	-0.102700	*	No one said they were denied healthcare. It's just so expensive that many go without. They will absolutely allow you to ruin yourself financially to access American healthcare.
t1_dsjhugz	0.636900	*	It's hilarious how much they go on about Freedom, and how little freedom they have compared to most western european countries.

t1_dswr3sk	0.000000	*	> I mean abortion is killing a living human regardless of the circumstances  If you fertilize an egg, is that a human? If you ejaculate inside a woman while she's ovulating, is that a human?

t1_dtn8tj3	0.401900	*	Okay. In Iran (and apparently on Wikipedia), hijab is a generic term that includes all different forms of headdress. The headscarf is called a roo-sari in Iran.
t1_dtoad3u	-0.105500	*	Or maybe don't care about votes and simply learn to think critically about every post.  Fuck the voting system really, it's pure cancer.

t1_dtaevhz	0.228000	*	I have heard Bavaria described as the Texas of Germany; is that accurate?
t1_dt2gk44	0.000000	*	Well, that was erudite and speaks well for your cause. And just when I was beginning to feel a bit of regret over the fuck the turks thing. Meh. Thanks for the cheap justification.
t1_dsj1ggd	-0.778600	*	I stopped watching the Press conferences and only read about them now. SHS is such an insufferable liar, with the same responses ad nauseam 
t1_dtanlyz	0.648600	*	No, and that's not what I said.  I feel like you're being intentionally obtuse.  Trump Receives Mixed Reception at Davos would have been a more accurate headline.
t1_dtdmayr	-0.726900	*	You should be asking the guy who actually called the kid edgy. Not me. 
t1_dt3atxv	0.051600	*	Best show dealing with ethics imho, but they do it in a fun way
t1_dsfgjx8	-0.526700	*	Whoever had that trademark needs kleenex.  Google around, and you see this is a xerox of other situations.  I hope I don't get spammed for posting this.
t1_dt3fv4p	0.361200	*	It wouldn't be the first time Australia's been a human rights disaster. Have you seen the film Rabbit Proof Fence?
t1_dttsxmv	0.318200	*	You sound like a trump lover. 
t1_dt5wm6x	-0.077200	*	Unfortunately not for some. 
t1_dsfdnlc	-0.528300	*	This is about leakers and they followed the law. Nothing to see here... trump is out here yelling fake news when someone says hes unhealthy...

t1_dt8u0eh	-0.226300	*	> They're not Americans, though, so why the fuck do we care about their rights? I bet most of them don't even own guns.  ----  > Looks too much like a legit comment. Needs a /s.  **holy shit**
t1_dtik5sm	-0.683000	*	As an ultramarathon runner, old people generally do way better than younger people in them. Not saying he'd do well specifically but generally 80% of the entrants are above 40 and go up till like 80
t1_dth94sw	-0.526700	*	Yes, Ukraine, but you'll still go on telling falsehoods. It won't matter what I say.

t1_dtuaqtz	-0.985200	*	So youre saying that domestic violence rates are homogeneous within a country? For every country? Id like to know more about those statistics, please.
t1_dsfjlsn	-0.655300	*	Not exactly. Im sure China etc. would be behaving in the same way, but this gives them better standing to do so in the court of public opinion. Trumps aiding their causes.
t1_dsl77tq	0.728000	*	Yea I know. Many people are sadly still brainwashed by mainstream media.
t1_dsfy2ae	0.000000	*	What part is that? The part where they say did not find anything on Trump?
t1_dsjhvv4	-0.077200	*	NO!  It is *not* typical for a politician to proclaim a fake event as if it really happened in order to push an ethno-religious agenda.

t1_dtd1x1w	0.261700	*	Neither did we. Damn...  Cant predict the future.  
t1_dtmzlho	0.000000	*	It means that without the dossier they wouldnt even have attempted to get the warrant, the warrant is based around the dossier.

t1_dt3y6g4	0.718900	*	Why is it not recommended? Lots of people use hot water from the faucet to make drinks.
t1_dtxtbik	0.393900	*	Hillary Clinton paid the gov't (through the DNC) to issue a warrant.  Nothing needs to be inflated past that.  She got caught with her hand in the cookie jar unfortunately.

t1_dt6hu1y	0.000000	*	LMFAO! That's funny but if everyone makes a joke about everything nothing will get done correctly. If tomorrow you were asked who should create this Bill who would you choose?
t1_dteawe4	0.000000	*	Also, the Tsars tended to reserve disappearances for dangerous nobles and imperial relatives. Rebellious commoners got mowed down by Cossacks. 
t1_dsrnnet	0.624900	*	Nothing lasts forever, that doesn't mean we shouldn't be trying to maintain it if for no other reason than the alternative is likely disastrous for everyone.

t1_dtihiff	-0.950900	*	Mr Clue. You need to dig in to how Reagan built the modern day taliban, even invited them to tea at the whitehouse, dedicated a space shuttle to them. Pics or it didnt happen. No you go get a clue. 
t1_dsutnr6	0.954300	*	How many immigrants should be allowed into the US? Give me some idea of what you believe here.
t1_dsv9g0w	0.616600	*	this is true for the most part, there are just some aggro sharks (primarily bull sharks) that give all sharks a bad rap.
t1_dtncyem	0.000000	*	Hell yes. If purging this country of this evil meaning shooting rednecks and bankers, I'm all for it.
t1_dss2jz3	0.025800	*	Those are orthogonal terms.  It's akin to saying That's not an appliance, it's a refrigerator.
t1_dsjtpos	0.000000	*	It's easy to feel this way when you're reading alt-right media. Stop reading that stuff, and you'll stop feeling that way. 
t1_dtmrt21	-0.956900	*	So our measurement is death, and nothing else? Seems like an unfair comparison. 
t1_dt39q8c	-0.440400	*	Execute them!
t1_dtvdu0u	0.888500	*	so...it was to save your chickens, not for fun, right?
t1_dt6gv98	0.559700	*	Doesnt matter, same laws apply to you as everyone else. That's the point
t1_dti71qk	-0.955300	*	Probably true but America not gonna come out unhurt. 
t1_dswo7nj	0.585900	*	I am glad to admit I'm wrong then. I am thrilled that funding goes to social work students. If most groups that get funding are like this then it's great imo.
t1_dtddijg	-0.750100	*	That is also true.
t1_dsus509	0.000000	*	In what manner?  It doesn't increase the amount of wealth in the country,  if anything it just means the same amount of wealth is spread more thinly
t1_dt8t01p	-0.571900	*	Why does anyone need to burn a Quran other than to send a message of hate to Muslims? I personally hate Christians, but I don't go around burning the New Testament.
t1_dtewmj9	0.000000	*	I think i'd like to see a 35 year old president.
t1_dtvnwbp	-0.296000	*	You missed my point. Let me spell it out for you: Nobody should be telling women which religion or dogma they choose to follow.
t1_dstiq4k	0.000000	*	Thats good, but as a pun..?
t1_dspxqav	-0.648600	*	The Palestinians get to go back to their country Jordan you mean.
t1_dtp2te4	0.419400	*	RT is also filled with propaganda, like when RT reported that in Denmark you could let zoo-lions eat your unwanted pets, which the whole of Denmark responded with What?.
t1_dtl51n8	-0.599400	*	Somehow I feel a lot of the crowd who hates Muslims hates Jews as well. Scratch them hard enough..
t1_dtoeq9b	-0.381800	*	If you don't think the battle flag is an issue, you don't know enough about the Jim Crow South or the Civil Rights movement.

t1_dsp5hgb	0.340000	*	Is there a way to see it at full speed? Obviously it's super short but I'm curious
t1_dtt2jl1	0.000000	*	What made them terrorists is being Muslim. Even though most of them had no affiliations to terrorist groups. 
t1_dttfqul	-0.700300	*	Try Lichtenberg, Neukoeln and Marzahn in Berlin.
t1_dsq8szc	0.000000	*	That's fair. I guess i just feel like the intent of the attacker is also a big component to it. It would be super interesting if a prosecutor tried to argue sexual assault or molestation in court. 
t1_dtvtzo8	0.238200	*	its clear he paid a buttload of money to kill an animal for no reason, that tells you at least the first fucking thing about him
t1_dtnmzs7	0.000000	*	Yes. Few civilizations are totally wiped out and it would have been a long decline over many years.
t1_dsm46nv	0.797800	*	I don't think it's about not belonging. People are interested in meeting people who have a different culture or upbringing.
t1_dtsl8cb	0.458800	*	Aww..Hillary didn't win.  Sad tears.
t1_dtso9kr	-0.557400	*	>  it's saying 'x is not bad because x happens on your side as well'. That's fallacious.  Which he is not doing. He is simply pointing out that it happens on another side too and that both are bad.
t1_dt877d4	0.636900	*	do you consider the USA a democracy?
t1_dsgloen	-0.128000	*	Capitalism is less than 500 years old. If you redefine all economic relationships before 1500 as capitalist (or proto- capitalist) it's not surprising capitalism looks inevitable.
t1_dt7x5lq	0.000000	*	> off to buy my coconut/almond milk at double the price of standard milk   Ah OK, you confuse 'hype' with 'healthy'.  I've just saved you a bundle.
t1_dtoupzj	0.000000	*	Yea, you are right, almost every conviction. A few courts wouldnt give out the documents. I stand corrected. 
t1_dt3f1dn	0.000000	*	Great analogy man.... fucking top notch analogy!    NAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHT
t1_dseuw0t	0.860500	*	Of course you can't hear EA, you didn't buy the Hearing DLC.
t1_dttea8s	-0.140600	*	Typical colonial excuses.  
t1_dtgmpgc	-0.247700	*	Or both are wrong? Not taking a stand myself, here, but whataboutism doesnt absolve Trump of wrong-doing. 
t1_dslnhbj	-0.784500	*	Lol you should see the immigrants from shithole countries. I always wonder how they survive day to day.
t1_dt4x4ss	-0.222200	*	I love how you are now ignoring the guy who gave the lengthy explanation with plenty of sources proving his stance. Argue his points if you want to keep spewing misinformation. 
t1_dswt8qo	0.102700	*	Not true. California has fetal homicide laws. [Scott Peterson was convicted of double homicide for the 2 lives he took.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unborn_Victims_of_Violence_Act)
t1_dsl10ju	-0.557400	*	Yeah about that fucking ambassador. The thing broke upon arrival. Can you send a new one?
t1_dt14pjl	0.000000	*	Sorry, not even about agreeing with you or not. I thought you were the same commenter as Dave and used an alt account by accident. Turns out I just struggle with reading comprehension when tired. 
t1_dtpznf2	0.659700	*	For the better? You think smart devices have helped the human race?
t1_dtbs22s	0.000000	*	there is evidence presented in these investigations. so far all you people can do is personal insults
t1_dt334we	-0.810500	*	Yeah it's unprofessional and childish but again not that big a deal. 
t1_dt94bit	0.318200	*	-And then Nixon's vice president immediately pardoned Nixon. If it weren't for that he could have still ended up charged
t1_dt0iqpn	0.637400	*	Less about that, more about maintaining a balance. With Iran and Saudi Arabia are pretty in a mini Cold War. No reason to let the people literally chanting death to America gain control
t1_dsjxk3w	-0.687400	*	Fox News defended the nazis. The president defended the nazis. So, in my opinion, anyone that hasn't turned their backs to both, it's not necessarily a nazi, but it's certainly complacent.
t1_dsq52hk	0.709600	*	Uhh... this comment is... I don't agree with a single thing you said. I now regret making my replying to you in the first place.
t1_dtibccq	0.853900	*	Idk but I feel like it costing 2 million would be excessive.  80 million to move 76 people and equipment? Im sure theres more to it but... EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS
t1_dtipqc7	0.000000	*	Ok? Because it was brought up 9 years ago one time it it has always been an upfront issue on Reddit? Im saying these are cropping up a lot lately and it seems fishy. 
t1_dtco2co	0.906200	*	Probably distribution too.  Kikkoman is probably one of the world's most popular soy sauce brand.  Having a western factory allows them to ship it to their markets cheaper.
t1_dslypqg	0.061300	*	They're somewhat different culturally
t1_dttc7s4	0.076200	*	Ah, well hopefully you and your loved ones never have a disease which NHS wouldn't cover.
t1_dt96irt	0.768400	*	Jesus... Fact:  Not all Floridians are old, idiots or cat lovers.  
t1_dtd0zt3	0.000000	*	No. It wouldnt because that is how tyranny starts.   He had two terms. Its over. 
t1_dtnyoos	0.077200	*	I understand that. But I believe this could clear up misconceptions the other redditors have.
t1_dtrfvxc	0.585900	*	Yes, but it was more enjoyable when the suggested videos were based more on what you were currently watching, rather than your watch history
t1_dt8nk1o	0.273200	*	Yeah, and hey, all the Chinese that the Japanese raped, murders and used as science experiments should've fought that Japanese occupation. Nobody is fucking innocent.
t1_dsl43s5	-0.226300	*	I love him so far. Just saying hes not a Republican In anything other than name
t1_dspbq78	0.296000	*	The UK public hates it's own government in equal measure for invading Iraq, that war had absolutely no public support at any point.
t1_dsh7dl7	0.000000	*	You're in the same sub now
t1_dsrfmq7	0.273200	*	Here's the first line:  > Icelandxa0has become the first major retailer to...
t1_dskew72	0.834300	*	No (wo)man. I like it.
t1_dstr40f	-0.612400	*	Replace that with Japan if you want a more acceptable state full of racism.
t1_dtgbri5	-0.688700	*	well now it would be 2/3 that. big drop  edit: instead of downvotes i wouldnt mind someone explaining how a loss of 5% of your taxable revenue isnt a problem? how does this get made up?
t1_dthjqr4	0.000000	*	Say something bad about...[insert here]. Lol.  Say it to yourself, you don't think it's ridiculously childish? You need to up your debate game, son.  You're clearly  struggling.
t1_dt2ntx0	-0.648600	*	Because one makes you accept a ToS that gives up your information and the other is not controlled by a private entity that can do whatever they want with your property and information.
t1_dtve6lv	-0.690800	*	I know they aren't a member. I am just not sure what your point is. Suddenly Ukraine. doesn't convey a lot of meaningful information. Are you saying NATO let it happen or what?
t1_dt2jld7	0.000000	*	Im not sure if you intentionally did a Godwins Law there but if so, I applaud you. 
t1_dst0ooc	0.361200	*	Its so you can give them out to people. Also Japan is pretty heavy on 'clean' things, and so its precieved 'cleaner' to have them wrapped that way, at least by the manufactures. 
t1_dsjpjnh	0.000000	*	Right. Im sure nobody acts on the information they know. 
t1_dsz2z8t	0.361200	*	Aw, I'm glad that makes you feel better.
t1_dtn40lj	0.273200	*	I'm OK with it happening as long as it's done sensibly. I have zero faith in the people doing it. Just trying to clear up some misconceptions.

t1_dtss686	0.104300	*	Straw man. Not an argument. 
t1_dswmqh2	0.807400	*	Except for the fact you don't need to take care of it once you've had it. Adoption.

t1_dsgx8bf	0.421500	*	You can trust this guy.   All Mcdonalds employees are well versed in every level of corporate business
t1_dt1436t	-0.880100	*	Yes. That's the  point. And it wasn't called the Texas Mexican war it was the Spanish-American War.
t1_dt1sd85	0.920100	*	Rich people still need poor people to buy things.
t1_dshgv6v	0.505000	*	If everyone could move their file exe32 to the recycle bin and empty their trash we would all be ok

t1_dsf5pud	-0.929800	*	Except Trump was elected making fun of people. I refuse to equate both sides when it's obvious vitriol and ignorance are clearly the tools of the GOP.
t1_dsjw9yz	-0.888800	*	What is a death panel?  I have an american education.
t1_dtup22b	0.153100	*	Can I have the rights to make the movie?
t1_dsfjkpu	-0.713100	*	And destroyed the lives of hundreds of millions and their children. Ussr was a cancer amongst countries.
t1_dt9l04r	0.000000	*	Our country is ruined because the population of whites is %56? Hmmm... sounds like something a racist would say.

t1_dt8mdma	-0.713400	*	True. Albeit Russia is probably not close to the US's tally :p
t1_dtrutah	-0.628600	*	You fail at logic.  Japan started the war therefore they get bombed.  Pretty simple but you still managed to fuck it up.
t1_dtvum1r	0.000000	*	Lol it's more like 90 for 1-3 years, 50-70 for 5-10 years, and then 20-40 for the rest of their careers including a lot of golf/travel.  Source: am doing this.
t1_dsjpgi6	0.421500	*	Rap Music and the Inner City in place of the words and rhetoric they'd prefer to say. 
t1_dsuy4e1	0.000000	*	Well if you can't find people to take a sucky job for $14 an hour looks like you'll have to raise the pay until you find someone who thinks it's worth it.
t1_dtj7b9q	-0.950100	*	Yes they do and most people in their are terrorists very few are falsely convicted so the pros (terrorists being tortured and imprisoned) outweigh the false convictions
t1_dsycrre	0.000000	*	It was a test I believe to see if he could work under pressure haha. But yes that blowjob scene made that movie. 
t1_dtp0f8e	0.296000	*	You're confused about some people calling themselves Catholics committing atrocities? Seriously? It's hardly like it hadn't happened before (for centuries).

t1_dstw9ek	0.686800	*	I am Russian, he is pretty popular. Not popular enough to win the election, but he gained momentum this past year.
t1_dt90ltl	0.448200	*	You know that's what the alt-right wants to do also, right? 
t1_dstqx3m	0.000000	*	Yeah, like a cornucopia made of snakes where the opening is a holographic vortex showing a unified Korean utopia at the center
t1_dtqmwc3	0.440400	*	Just because you see value in one of the places doesn't mean the poor countries dispute is not valid.

t1_dsm73c4	0.273200	*	I would say a lot of people of Polish and Jewish heritage consider themselves as white, and also benefit from white privilege because they can pass. 
t1_dsii6gn	0.690800	*	Yeah might have worded it poorly. The title of this news makes it out to be way more sensational than it truely is was my point.
t1_dsx9vai	0.296000	*	Its not semantics. Currency and stock are two very different things.   Supply is irrelevant since its the value of the item experiencing inflation.
t1_dtsnkuq	0.000000	*	It doesn't sound like you are looking for data. You sound like you are looking for an excuse to dismiss this correlation as irrelevant.  (Look at your first message in this thread)
t1_dtworl2	-0.836000	*	Were you a guy or a girl?  I just don't see why a girl would be mad if you were a guy unless she thought your bro was secretly bi or something

t1_dsmav03	0.000000	*	Calling a country a shithole isn't racist. If I call America a shithole, am I racist?
t1_dt6qdcq	0.401900	*	> Flirt is reciprocal, that's it  The first person to flirt does not know whether it will be reciprocated. Don't think in black and white.

t1_dtte0n6	0.000000	*	So what you are saying is that America deserves to be insulted far more because it drives tanks into many other nations?  Also believe it or not NK was ahead of SK until the mid-late 80's.

t1_dszsqdh	0.695600	*	If you had a twitter account I'd totally follow you if I had a twitter account.
t1_dtms243	-0.721900	*	That's not true at all. I recommend looking at the municipal elections going on right now. You don't have to be a member of the PCC to be elected.

t1_dsi2g55	0.000000	*	So the only accounts we should leave up are anti-Brexit, pro-Democrat, pro-Palestinian, anti-Russian posters?  I wonder what side of the aisle you're on.

t1_dt79jcg	0.153100	*	If the two joined, SK would get nukes though right? I have to imagine SK is at least mildly interested in something like that. 
t1_dt8glwt	0.981200	*	Im glad I finally found another redditor who shares the same sentiment. Thats rare these days. Good luck in all your future endeavors my fellow like minded Pal.

t1_dsvdupe	0.000000	*	Things don't really resist change in velocity though, it's just that a larger mass requires a proportionally larger force to achieve the same velocity outcome.
t1_dtawcg6	-0.401900	*	Both arms you say?
t1_dszv2z7	0.000000	*	They didn't see the need.   Besides, if these people were actually murdered, then the cameras wouldn't have stopped it.

t1_dtitarp	-0.551400	*	Rofl yes. If you have access to more money you spend more money. Inflation goes up and you might get the exact same amount of stuff... but you are still spending more.
t1_dtq49xq	0.000000	*	Spoken like a liberal. So whats the better option? Sit around and demand someone pays your way?

t1_dt9mq9e	-0.947000	*	What's the evasion you talk about? Beyond Trump's lawyers reluctance to let him be interviewed which, as others have said, seems more related to risk of perjury.
t1_dt04pra	0.841300	*	How?  Jacking up prices on drugs seems morally wrong and not a sign of genius because the idiot got arrested
t1_dt0sl32	0.226300	*	I won't really go back if my tank is hit by a rag if we have to invade I hope they choose me for the armata but I drove it and I can say they reliability is on par of a panther tank after just 50km

t1_dsk9sd6	-0.057200	*	It looks like golf tees stacked. 
t1_dsv6qzh	0.361200	*	His base is what 33% of voters? If he pisses off at least 50% of Americans he'll be in pretty dire straights.
t1_dtqa9wq	0.226300	*	> NYC is contemplating instituting a tax to drive in lower Manhattan.  Are they getting closer to this though? Ive been hearing about this for years. 
t1_dsklzas	0.000000	*	Eh I mean I could make the statements ostriches can fly and ostriches are incapable of any form of physical movement as a species.  Both statements are bullshit even though they contradict each other.
t1_dta2v9z	-0.318200	*	I doubt it's the liquids rule causing this. That's basically the anti bear rock logic. 
t1_dsraq8n	0.680100	*	A few hundred more directly anyway.
t1_dt5vm86	0.652700	*	That's not *quite* true.  The World Freedom Index puts us at 18 (http://www.socialprogressindex.com/?tab=2&code=DNK). Which is the start of the bottom quartile for the freest countries.

t1_dthikka	0.000000	*	It most definitely has. You are painfully uninformed. Do yourself a favor, and find the correction from the NYT. 
t1_dsnxyn1	-0.318200	*	We tried to protect your stupid empire, the one Churchill lost. Eat your eels and enjoy the fog today, you're in 18th place.

t1_dsdqq7x	-0.690800	*	Kinda good at missing the point, aren't you?  Do some research on the area prior to 1948.

t1_dt96l8b	-0.318200	*	My point is Trump failing to turn up for a visit isn't going to affect US/UK trade, or the relationship.  
t1_dtooux2	0.359500	*	Finally someone got the reference!
t1_dth37f4	0.624900	*	Their grievances will have merit when they elect a representative to represent them.  They supported a demagogue when they had legitimate options.  They are now responsible for his actions.
t1_dsqafay	0.025800	*	you mean the same polls that showed he had less than a 3 percent chance of winning and he demolished Hillary in an electoral vote count?
t1_dsq7pw0	-0.296000	*	I don't think you even know what that means. The context of my statement was pointing out the irony of the shortsightedness of the statement I was responding to. Got anything else?
t1_dsjz06g	0.636900	*	Says the guy that calls right wing news propoganda  Your tinfoil hats dont even look good
t1_dtbvsqr	0.361200	*	I actually disagree, taking advantage of the enemies lenience and trust to children is a terrible thing even if you're fighting nazis.

t1_dtfpoor	-0.296000	*	That's on them then for making themselves so economically dependent. No one is going to stop them from leaving except for themselves, and that's more than what can be said about US States.
t1_dteionp	0.851900	*	Reddit's (laughable) standard response to this is vote.  All we can really do is pray for a deus ex machina type of technology to save us.

t1_dtd8tk1	0.855500	*	Was that before or after he started slashing regulations?
t1_dtsqs3e	0.904200	*	Interesting. I like a lot of what he has to say. Though, I'm not sure how cutting corporate taxes by 5% and cutting our own taxes at the same time would help clear the deficit.

t1_dt19qtp	0.784500	*	Good point.  My main point is the biggest benefit of democracy is that it keeps the leaders beholden to the people. That is true even with an uneducated populace.  
t1_dt0b8ve	0.147700	*	Why do so many more people want to move to white countries than any other? I'd say a culture where women are seen as men's property is worse than one where they are free.
t1_dswkq4h	0.000000	*	I thought it was pretty clear and concise. I was responding to his apparent misconception that men can't have abortions in Canada, but they can.

t1_dszv2z7	0.328300	*	They didn't see the need.   Besides, if these people were actually murdered, then the cameras wouldn't have stopped it.
t1_dswkr39	0.128000	*	Conspiracy theories are just the CIA sowing confusion and distrust in the populace so they're easier to control.
t1_dswpix8	0.467800	*	It's actually one of the things I envy of church groups. I wish there were large secular groups that would do this for non religious families. 
t1_dtvrn4c	0.875300	*	If we had less people, it would be easier to manage. If you have kids, you are environmentally irresponsible until such a time as we can learn to manage resources.
t1_dtdfbju	0.000000	*	Spirits, could you put Boris on the line for me and ask him?
t1_dszgw1s	-0.015500	*	It's condescending for sure. But for something so simple, Google is literally easier than asking someone on Reddit...  Google even gives you a cool graph and links to as many sources as you'd like.

t1_dt9ch05	-0.943200	*	If it claims Trump touched you in the early 90s, they honestly probably would.

t1_dtlxd1v	-0.648600	*	Yeah I get that, which is part of why I don't intend on trying it ever.  Though I would chew on some coca leaves if given the chance probably. Stimulants in general seem overrated though.

t1_dsyxjvt	-0.727100	*	Actually we do have a free market. What you're seeing is the natural end game of a free market when the big players simply buy or force out the competition.

t1_dtc2juk	0.250000	*	Well climate change has a pr problem. Your ignoring reality if you don't believe this. Enter the real world and find viable solutions instead of yelling into the wind we are all going to die.

t1_dtcli3p	-0.875000	*	Not really true. Cows fed too much corn can get overly acidic rumens and fuck up their digestion/health and make them prone to disease. 
t1_dsphgfi	0.453500	*	Interesting - it shows some wisdom to lock some of the money away.  Regardless 8K goes a long way backpacking through some countries. 
t1_dssux26	0.000000	*	But for reals though, if palestinians were real men they wouldn't let tiny things such as foreign interference stop them from whatever their goals are.  Right?

t1_dtis3f8	-0.725100	*	It's not very hard to answer this question if you spend any time at all thinking about it.  Some mentally unstable people can be very violent and destructive.

t1_dta5y51	0.000000	*	What is better: A fine or a traditional British duel to the dead?
t1_dsjwgbq	0.244800	*	>  They wouldn't have chosen to run Hillary Clinton against Trump.  You actually think the American people chose these two candidates? That's cute.
t1_dsfd101	-0.648600	*	Not really. In the Arab world, the derogatory term fagg*t is Looteh which comes from Loot (Lot in Arabic).
t1_dsoti4z	0.000000	*	Your question perplexes me. May I ask why you're not a Trump supporter? What is it about Trump's platform/ideology that you disagree with?

t1_dspmk8e	0.154000	*	Not that I *like* to watch, I was merely *expecting* to watch, possibly knowing it might disturb me. Hence the slight disapointment, it was anti-climatic.
t1_dswgncc	0.571900	*	I work in assurance.  But more to the point, no you really don't have any justification to hold a strong opinion on this subject which you clearly don't have an education in.

t1_dsvgkds	-0.340000	*	Men have more genotype variance because they're more prone to mutations, but I could see how that in turn would cause more risk taking behaviour.

t1_dsjoqnz	0.318200	*	Yeah way to demonstrate your rationality.  Not sure you understand the concept.  But I wouldn't expect a high level from someone so ready to generalize and cast aspersions. 
t1_dtst52t	0.476700	*	Saudi Arabia only mandates the scarf for muslims. Even still, that hardly constitutesmost.  Cultural expectations of some rural tribes aren't law. 
t1_dswjtqc	0.000000	*	An embryo or a fetus is not a child....
t1_dslfvu1	0.535200	*	Well I guess we shouldn't care about historic statues anymore guys, some nazis are here, wrap it up
t1_dtjbwck	0.372400	*	So things that are wrong shouldn't be stood against because it doesn't effect a person directly.

t1_dtpr126	-0.273200	*	That's fair, so they're not getting the initial 'auto alerts' so to speak and to look into each individually would just be way too time consuming?  This is really good to know, thank you 
t1_dta5tcq	-0.776100	*	No, but they were suspended which in terms of money is as expensive as a lawsuit. Also, freedom of speech cannot be overrun by corporate policy if the protest is not harming the NFL.
t1_dtjkbz3	-0.421500	*	Yeah but at what point do they realize the stupid shit they are doing doesnt actually work? How many generations does it take to realize this?
t1_dt0gjcy	-0.607200	*	>  What has someone to do to deserve it?   Maybe joining a terrorist organization that wants to kill and murder thousands of people should be enough.
t1_dtvuhqu	0.421500	*	Copyright laws are *much* worse in the US because of how our legal system works. It's much easier for large companies to engage in spurious lawsuits over here.

t1_dswcn1h	0.000000	*	Salt water puts out the flames, yes-but then it leaves the land totally unable to grow *anything*. Firefighting with salt water is unintentionally salting the earth.

t1_dsz7ioa	0.768400	*	Eskimo Folk Tales as I knew it as a child, now called Inuit Folk Tales 40+ years later. Is that the one?  ETA: Across The Polar North? The expedition tale itself not the story and myth book.
t1_dtokwz6	-0.967500	*	You could say this about any war, but there were a number of pivotal moments where the South could have easily crushed the Northern armies or avoided major defeats. So, they definitely had a chance.

t1_dtsnkuq	-0.326900	*	It doesn't sound like you are looking for data. You sound like you are looking for an excuse to dismiss this correlation as irrelevant.  (Look at your first message in this thread)

t1_dsjjppb	-0.250000	*	Oh yes, some were worse than others. Russia sweeping into Germany  and Nanking being the main ones of WWII.      But make no mistake. Raping and pillaging happens in every war.
t1_dta4jpo	-0.735100	*	But she also says that in America officers have their name on their uniform. So according to her you wouldn't have to ask. I've never been to the US so I can't verify any of it.

t1_dt6vxx6	0.361200	*	Nah. Ill stick around.   And no, the charter never mentions financial compensation. Like I said, the remedy was allowing that piece of shit back in the country.

t1_dsy5hfz	0.000000	*	Okay so if you wandered over the border into Canada tomorrow, do they have a right to kick you out? Because that's all that Israel is doing, only with 40,000 people.
t1_dtjqswj	-0.670500	*	Sure, but his point was that India and the US were both part of the British Empire at the same time. Which is not true. India was controlled by Britons, not the Crown.

t1_dse01fo	0.612400	*	Yes. You are missing the technical knowledge required to understand why things dont work out as tested and why speed of transactions dont matter when node creation isnt incentivised

t1_dtdgzu8	-0.712300	*	You mean the empire that was mostly gone before most of us were born? Do you wanna take a moment to speak about slavery and racism if you want to go down that route?
t1_dsxrbaj	-0.406200	*	Your comment about the hospital has no relation to this topic. There's no need for personal insults just because you disagree with what I say. 
t1_dt4nwxh	0.000000	*	What do you think people have been doing?   In Ontario we do a weed march every year, smoking in public, and that's just one demonstration.
t1_dt0ioul	0.817600	*	That's the funny thing, the US doesn't get a whole bunch of oil from Saudi Arabia. Europe on the other hand, does.

t1_dtss36o	-0.599400	*	Though I do agree, you have to acknowledge that on the big picture end it's quite grey and hard to justify objectively why the line you draw down the middle of them is beyond contention.

t1_dsrayq9	-0.599400	*	But surely any jump in crime (even if its not comparable) which happens due to cuts made by the government is a fair discussion point right?
t1_dtlerhs	-0.695300	*	By that logic, there could also be even *less* attacks perpetrated by Muslims, since, you know, eye witness testimonies are unreliable, right? Maybe all these people *THOUGHT* they were Muslim!

t1_dsgedhu	0.172400	*	By that logic you should lock them inside the house, cuz they can get raped by anyone at anytime.

t1_dtr3zb9	0.401900	*	I thought Jews left Egypt.. That would be their homeland, I even vaguely recall a archeology dig in western Egypt purporting to be a Jewish settlement with burial sites and everything.

t1_dsp1m54	0.000000	*	That's the one!  (I think; I don't actually know.  I just know that one of the airplanes that carried them was called Voodoo, which is just a cool name for a nuclear armed fighter.)
t1_dtgpsha	-0.746900	*	> As for WWII, we didn't interfere. We entered the war as a result of a blatant attack.  So if not for Pearl Harbor, you feel the US should have stayed out of WWII?

t1_dte85tb	0.234200	*	They use a lot of coal. That's a cute way of calling the air pea soup. China is a frickin joke. It's a massive polluter. Shoot the majority of pollution in *California* is from China.

t1_dts9mdw	0.000000	*	Thats a horrible analogy 
t1_dt734qu	-0.202300	*	This is literal nonsense. Mom and pop shops aren't going to fall under big corporations or the 1%. If the laws don't actually target those categories, that is an entirely different issue.
t1_dt79pfe	0.807200	*	Your idea is to make half of the country second class citizens that are exploited for cheap labor. IMO a terrible idea.

t1_dtwyboq	0.421500	*	I didn't miss that part, it just isn't meaningful enough to supersede reality. Good means skilled, not omnipotent.
t1_dtwa8im	0.750600	*	Circumcision is genital mutilation. Just because you don't like to hear it, doesn't change that fact.

t1_dsrfj4q	0.757900	*	Global warming is a bad term for what is happening. I learned it as **temperature variance**. Not that things just summarily get warmer, but that temperatures just become more and more ***chaotic.***
t1_dttpwql	-0.731900	*	Assigning blame helps identify the problem so we can work to fix it, instead of ignoring the problem and having it happen again. There are people to blame for this.
t1_dt4z0t2	0.361200	*	There are always more jobs you can lose.  EDIT: Person below me is deflecting.  Automation compounds the problem, and makes tariffs even *more* justified.

t1_dskllnb	-0.306000	*	Yep. Haitians get to own their successes and their failures.   Haiti should be judged on their GDP, prevalence of slavery and sex trafficking, and crime like every other country should be.

t1_dsne48i	-0.158600	*	No you just have people on the far left rioting and censoring people at colleges. 
t1_dtwfzt6	0.603800	*	Europe. I'm not sure how that's relevant though. You're still wrong for suggesting that white people would be killed if they went to the Middle East or Africa.
t1_dtuvg5d	0.051600	*	I see so many here in Canada still texting while driving - its a shame. Youre not even allowed to talk on your cell phones yet that still happens regulary - especially in the city. 
t1_dtf1ycm	0.318200	*	If the capitalist are not allowed to be capitalist, then is it really capitalism?
t1_dt8u2cc	-0.275500	*	I mean, they could keep him wherever they want. A zoo, for example. With the orangutans. Hell fit right in. 
t1_dsv05n4	-0.077200	*	But who does it mean a lot to? I'm still unclear on this. 
t1_dsnfyg4	0.000000	*	Old fridges before magnetic sealing were sealed with a latch. Kids used to play hide and seek and get trapped in old-style fridges and die.

t1_dtbmia1	-0.494600	*	To who? I doubt any countries care about our moral integrity. In fact it is seemingly exploited by various peoples and states.
t1_dt5yhjt	0.153100	*	I think people are ignoring this one cause most people would take a religion that says Women can't go into this room over one that says Women should be stoned for being raped.

t1_dt5tghk	-0.226300	*	The right will never cave on amnesty. We learned that lesson in the 80s  Humanitarian my ass. Childish liberal policies encouraged more illegals to come, and continue to do so
t1_dtjfrk5	0.000000	*	No...I don't think so. I already have a hard time saying no (despite my bitchy exterior in this thread) and I'd probably cry like I used to at just the sight of a homeless person.

t1_dtwqe5l	0.848100	*	This is one of the most logical posts I've read so far. I'm really surprised the value of human life vs other animals is scoffed at by such a large number of people. 
t1_dska9zj	0.000000	*	Too bad he said that less than 20 years ago.   Edit: I'm pretty sure /u/Avenflar knew this and wasnt trying to defend Trump, everybody. Either way, we dont all need to downvote him or her.

t1_dtx6k9k	0.318200	*	That's a state thing. In Arizona you basically need a Driver's license or all the documents you would bring to get a Driver's license, including proof of citizenship because we're extra paranoid.

t1_dt1k66h	0.670500	*	My point is that there really wasn't that much of a defined agenda or demand for the protest beyond we don't like Trump, and I feel that they could've used the opportunity to codify that agenda.

t1_dtwzvhb	-0.339000	*	It's kinda actually sad that redditors are more likely to believe we're all literal Russian agents than think some people could support Trump.   Man I just wanna see the illegals gone.

t1_dskzexc	0.624900	*	I mean in my opinion, yes. Look at Scotland where they arrested someone for teaching their pug to do the nazi salute as a joke. Do we really want the state to have that kind of power?
t1_dt7e0id	0.000000	*	Well yeah, allegedly... then again we dont really know what hes like in person and it could be an act to get attention

t1_dsva4jo	-0.902200	*	Its like saying Washington state is known for its mountain lions.   Yeah, there are a lot of them there, but it doesn't mean you're going to be jumped by one while you're out for a jog.

t1_dsz0u66	0.778300	*	Some do. The religious Sunnis. The secular ones don't. The Syrians don't want Turkey taking their land. The Syrians are still upset over Turkey annexing the northwestern area of Syria in the 1930s.

t1_dtsql6s	-0.328300	*	Or maybe HKers should reflect on why mainlanders hate them so much.   The vast majority of mainlanders have never visited HK yet are still treated as inferior by HKers. 
t1_dtm026i	0.059400	*	Correct me if I'm wrong, but you're from Cambodia, right?  Kampuchea was supported by the US and despised by essentially everyone who was sane.
t1_dt79pfe	0.493900	*	Your idea is to make half of the country second class citizens that are exploited for cheap labor. IMO a terrible idea.

t1_dttnomt	-0.082800	*	I would suggest that is pretty naive.  Clinton got hit with lying, not having an affair.  The Democrats won't have forgotten about that.

t1_dt5vl9e	0.624900	*	Honestly, as of now I would prefer complete radio silence about Obama - he's not in office or any other particularly influencial position anymore.

t1_dt4wco9	0.000000	*	Glad you put the disclaimer, when it comes to. I'm eager to see how this plays out. In the end whatever fallout that hits most Americans, won't effect me. So, let's hope we stay pretty predictable.

t1_dtsrtos	0.659700	*	The rest of them will just be instantly trained and placed into new jobs then?
t1_dsz344g	-0.831600	*	I mean, ranked 12 behind a bunch of poor as fuck countries that no one has ever heard of outside of their own citizens is still pretty bad.  Definitely #1 out of developed nations.
t1_dtov8la	0.318200	*	Not really. Relations would deteriorate, but Turkey is still a part of NATO, and Russia won't risk a direct war.  Besides, don't underestimate the Turkish military, and overestimate the Russian.
t1_dsg16q9	0.589300	*	...Obama and Trump are both five letter names.   And the degree of similarity to the word swamp is equal in both.

t1_dtalju6	-0.674300	*	the vast majority of crime in the USA is as a result of a redneck culture which is most prevalent among African Americans. this massively skews all the statistics.

t1_dswn7gp	-0.097200	*	They said heroin, cocaine, meth, and you chose pot for your argument? A drug that's been decriminalized in Canada for years, and is on the verge of legalization?
t1_dserh6r	0.000000	*	My sweet summer child. Those are rules, not their goal. No one starts a business in hopes they can follow the rules. 
t1_dtslg4w	-0.980200	*	Israel doesn't order it's soldiers to kill civies. They're punished when they do. Palestine does order people to kill jews.

t1_dsmoj02	0.000000	*	The most humane thing would be not to kill and eat lobsters. It's not like they alone possess a nutrient found nowhere else in nature. 
t1_dt7fj9s	0.000000	*	It was just the Korean long con. South Korea builds an economic base, North Korea builds a military. They unify, take over the whole world.

t1_dtbt7f2	0.340000	*	No, what he said was that we don't value the lives of civilians killed from collateral damage. Which is true. How many thousands of civilians did we kill last year alone?

t1_dtdtskh	-0.807400	*	This is why I say that Trump's rise should be studied, not slammed with blind hatred. He was elected as a cultural and political over correction. Until we realize why, things won't get better.

t1_dta5ddd	-0.860300	*	The parent comment is about insulting someone in general being illegal.  Blackmail isn't close to insulting someone in general.
t1_dsk6iod	-0.600300	*	Knowing Trump. He will remember those things. There is a reason why he brags about having a good memory. He only remembers bad things said about him.
t1_dt043hc	-0.241100	*	As the owner of a 22 year old civic, I have to ask - why would anyone steal a 20 year old civic?
t1_dtd1h8o	-0.275500	*	Is that correspondence dinner a Obama thing or a presidential thing? If so, when does Trump do one?
t1_dsm6nus	-0.961800	*	What makes him a total asshole? I was listening to his conversation with Sam Harris, and he came across as reasonable.
t1_dt1uezi	0.000000	*	I've never been to India, but apparently there are areas where there are mansions and then down the street there are tons of homeless people begging? It seems surreal.
t1_dtvho22	0.000000	*	he meant 360 radians. 
t1_dswoj48	-0.486700	*	People seem to forget this tidbit.

t1_dtrbwty	0.914600	*	Serious question..does everyone you want to group chat with really have a FB account? Some of my friends dont have FB anymore and the easiest way to contact everyone is through basic texts
t1_dsiigqw	-0.542300	*	You said sense of inferiority when op clearly feels a sense of superiority (judging by the name). An inferiority complex is a different thing
t1_dsmopz5	0.597500	*	How far away from the sun are you?
t1_dskr4sn	-0.413100	*	Wow, unbelievable! It's beginning to make sense, then.
t1_dtoiz9t	0.000000	*	They are, but a lot of dark skinned people among them.  Btw Slav means a slave in Swedish, that was the word Vikings used to call them since they didnt come up with anything better I guess. 
t1_dtkw63t	0.214400	*	I wonder if they could revert back to resistance quickly too then. 
t1_dttts5i	-0.493900	*	This isn't banning people from talking about it. All this bill states is that the country as a whole cannot be held responsible for Nazi atrocities. 
t1_dtnyfv3	0.000000	*	Just because Canadians measure their personal height and weight in imperial doesn't make it a hybrid system.
t1_dsmrbs1	-0.442400	*	Wrong.  >Estimated 513,000 girls and women in the United States were *either* victims of FGM or at risk of FGM, with  under age 18.  http://www.prb.org/Publications/Articles/2015/us-fgmc.aspx

t1_dt9f6qp	0.399300	*	> countless things that are worse no matter how you look at it.  Like what? Could you name a few? Because I can't.
t1_dstsm9e	0.000000	*	The movie framed Dr Manhattan with a space laser the same way the comics framed aliens with a teleporting nuclear squid.     Which is lame because squids > space lasers.

t1_dt8w68p	0.273200	*	Meh, even if it's true, most suspect t_d does the same. No matter which side of the political spectrum you're on, we shouldn't stand for this shit, it's ruining our site.

t1_dtwn2sc	0.458800	*	Genocide. Good one
t1_dtdobii	0.000000	*	you can easily change things you control  the 66% is significantly more difficult - you'd have to stop using electricity altogether.  (Or get your parliament to enact laws encouraging renewables)
t1_dt8tdiy	0.000000	*	Yeah I think I killed some of them in AC at one point
t1_dtrjcm8	0.000000	*	lmao at the mental gymnastics to not label a white guy a terrorist. I'm looking forward to you being so charitable to the next brown terrorist who doesn't have an ISIS club card.
t1_dtgp1cs	-0.747900	*	There is absolutely no evidence of collusion and Russia certainly doesn't own our president lol. Next!
t1_dt0ikrb	0.458800	*	This doesn't even make sense. The USA doesn't need Saudi Oil. The USA has so much oil, it is one of the biggest Oil exporters in the World.
t1_dtge94z	0.612400	*	Impeachment enforced how?  He's ignoring a 419-3, 98-2 bill that he signed.  He would absolutely be willing to ignore articles of impeachment.  
t1_dst34b5	0.000000	*	The American brainwashing is real. America gave us the terrorists, Iraqi soldiers crushed Isis. 
t1_dsh14h6	0.493900	*	Ah, the classic diabetes dunk. 
t1_dskbhnh	-0.863400	*	I think having a kid from parents who are Scottish and German should be made a Geneva War Crime. Or have it made in to a public announcement health risk of what can happen.

t1_dsm152b	-0.476700	*	Trump is absolutely not nearly as universally hated in the US as Usamah was at the time.
t1_dtu1qez	0.000000	*	That's how it works in Italy. .ost restaurants are closed between the lunch and dinner rush. It's so stupid to stay open for one or two customers who might drop by. 
t1_dsurha8	-0.177900	*	Really? Where do you see that? From what I see, agriculture workers were entitled to the standard federal minimum wage starting in 1966
t1_dtvigc0	0.000000	*	> It's because they're uneducated on the subject.  I feel like not being educated on trophy hunting is a really poor excuse for threating to rape someone's wife and hunt them like an animal.
t1_dtt5zkk	0.000000	*	Except that other people can tell when you're wearing a scarf, but not when you're praying. If you want an analogy, then mandatory headscarves are like mandatory nipple covering.
t1_dsvunfc	-0.499700	*	I'm sure Russia is gonna get to the bottom of this.
t1_dt73tny	0.000000	*	Because it's not backed by a single study or any existing numbers. Show me a credible source that predicts what he said.   And no, it's not plausible. So I'll stick with it's bullshit

t1_dslet8w	0.458800	*	Nah Ill keep them thanks
t1_dttpfd3	0.401900	*	I agree. Humanity is the worst thing that have happened to earth in it's 5 billion history. I sometimes feel fucking disgust for being human.
t1_dsf2z0r	0.469600	*	France looks after people with French nationality, irrespective of their ethnicity.  Israel looks after people with Israeli nationality AND Jewish ethnicity.  Does that make sense?
t1_dt6jc69	-0.557400	*	Insulting Haiti is not the same as insulting the Haitian people.  
t1_dtil0eg	0.000000	*	Or ya know, America could have just let Cuba been independent without demanding land from them. Quit trying to defend blatant imperialism.
t1_dtfvkh7	0.025800	*	Hijab is an Arabic word that means headscarf... You probably think Allah is a name not just the word for God.

t1_dt2j2b2	0.493900	*	The mustache wasn't a bad look, sort of Chaplin-esque.... everything really went downhill from there though  edit: HOLD THE FORT... says here he didn't like Jews!
t1_dto790i	0.057200	*	I get the feeling I'm the one old enough to be your Dad. What is it about the mounting evidence the GOP has been compromised by Russia do you not agree with?
t1_dtpyt3d	0.000000	*	*white women. How many First Nations women nationally have disappeared and nothing has been done. 
t1_dsgx2xf	0.128000	*	What do you actually know about how Russian spies work? This is about how pathetic it gets when it comes to self-appointed experts on reddit 
t1_dtlupvo	0.421500	*	Exactly! People who live in reality don't agree with you
t1_dsjvv2x	-0.190100	*	What does that have to do with anything? What the fuck are you talking about?
t1_dtbr6fx	0.203500	*	They always disguise it with a fluffy name
t1_dsfy2ae	-0.765000	*	What part is that? The part where they say did not find anything on Trump?
t1_dsk483o	0.000000	*	Ah, so you know it's annoying. I only demonize people in lighthearted shitposts.  Don't judge the many by the loudest jerks of the group, please.
t1_dsugotp	0.000000	*	Says the guy/gal that thinks anecdotes are more significant than legit stats.
t1_dt0mcyi	0.000000	*	Maybe actually calling them out for giving false information instead of just insulting them like a child is a logical response
t1_dtvxzu5	0.542300	*	What, the facetious questions? No
t1_dsuq0v0	-0.340000	*	italian, french, spanish, portuguse, romanian. the five, but yes, though both used for love
t1_dsdv5g8	-0.920000	*	So we're all fighting over a ~~18th~~ 19th century philosopher's claims?
t1_dsiam3p	0.611500	*	But, hes, like, really, smart. 
t1_dt7bjug	0.612400	*	I'd play with you.  That came out terribly.
t1_dt5atmq	-0.812600	*	No, the original poster was correct.  The subject of the sentence is number, which the verb is/are acts on. Because it is being used as a singular collective noun, you need to use is here.
t1_dtiw31n	-0.250000	*	Arafat's family isn't, and they are living pretty off Palestinian blood. And Abbas is alive doing the same thing.
t1_dtk7nyd	0.690800	*	We are all /u/myheadhearst's friend on this blessed day
t1_dt9xs9c	0.722700	*	:P Trust me, I don't think ignorance is restricted to being American. I just feel that, despite widespread cultural naivety, most countries still manage not to end up in headlines for it.

t1_dsprgpg	-0.691700	*	>I don't know enough about Haiti to even make a suggestion that could be valid.  Yah you and 99% of the people in this thread. Maybe learn about the country you're up in arms about?
t1_dsogrst	0.025800	*	They are probably the kind of filters I'm talking about then. It is all about preventing radioactive dust from entering your lungs. 
t1_dttwlpj	0.952800	*	I list many sources and you list one. And you accuse me of being narrow with my sources? You must be a troll?
t1_dsl3td9	-0.663200	*	No, Nixon had that, too.  Listen to the tapes.
t1_dsyk03e	-0.169500	*	>On principle how is ~~immigration~~ healthcare reform relevant to a ~~budget~~ tax bill?

t1_dtvi4dq	0.361200	*	The logic can't be applied to rape because a person has the right to not be raped whereas the animal doesn't have the right to not be hunted.

t1_dsnxyn1	-0.680800	*	We tried to protect your stupid empire, the one Churchill lost. Eat your eels and enjoy the fog today, you're in 18th place.

t1_dszjqiv	0.223500	*	Nonsense, the only aired anime that don't get official releases in the west now are children's shows.  Between Crunchyroll, Amazon and Netflix we see it all.

t1_dt8vg28	-0.476700	*	Thats not really influence of any kind, even. Its *their* events that theyre excluding the agreement breakers from. Literally any organization can do that. 
t1_dsjsniw	0.205200	*	I can agree with stealing their data, nothing to be gained by discarding good data for morals after the fact.   However, they really shouldn't have given refuge and even fame to those people.
t1_dsnpv66	0.000000	*	Are you Naziphobic?  Or is it less about fear and more about disagreeing with ideology?
t1_dsz7pgm	-0.458800	*	Reddit doesnt hate them because theyre women, they hate them because theyre vile people.   The comments usually have nothing to do with their sex, but how theyre disgusting people. 
t1_dt9b7i4	0.764400	*	Not sure if you're saying it negatively, but Quxe9bec DOES have to protect it's frenchness...

t1_dtunx4e	0.367800	*	Yup, those launch and land pads are incredibly expensive / time consuming to build, so it makes sense if you know it's not perfect to avoid it.
t1_dt6h5lw	0.458800	*	Because he is talking like a moral authority when he is just as hipocrate as all other popes. He could do so much more to improve the world yet he chooses not to, all in the name of greed.

t1_dsjeq3g	-0.913400	*	It wasn't war though initially for the Japanese, it was the same Nazi mindset of believing they deserved everything and everyone else was below them

t1_dszyhq7	0.458800	*	That analysis is fascinating to me. Why do so many people care so much about abortion while seeming to care so little about overall reproductive health?
t1_dt31bpr	-0.019100	*	Brah even if you had a legit tape recording of Trump saying this they would still spin it off as fake news comon now.

t1_dtwkpcc	0.671600	*	The Habsburgs. Which, of course, were an Austrian dynasty, I'm not arguing that at all. But it's not as simple as HRE = Austria. The prince-electors and the Reichsunmittelbarkeit made sure of that.
t1_dsv21c0	0.000000	*	Even assuming all 100 would overstay their visas, you think that this will *solve* visa overstays?
t1_dt18lo3	-0.318200	*	True, but also the Communist has a pretty solid hold on the military, and it cannot really act as an independent institution in the sense that it can in many other countries.

t1_dtg2jk4	-0.051600	*	But apparently its our fault because we eat avocado on toast...

t1_dsjhbv9	-0.918400	*	200 explosives small enough to fit on a $300 drone will not take out a whole town or village. You could do a lot more damage with the >$100k this operation would cost.

t1_dtny4c7	-0.920100	*	And that seems like a good idea? Let's take a regular patrol and really up the danger level since apparently gambling with lives is fun.   If the Russians are retarded doesn't mean we should be. 
t1_dsgqoly	0.000000	*	- U.S.EA

t1_dsirn1f	-0.371600	*	No... It specifically refers to people thinking he died in the 80s while in prison when he actually died decades later.  Just take a second abd read the few sentences at the top of the sidebar.
t1_dsxqggp	-0.476700	*	I don't think China is a failure, I think it has widespread corruption and little civil rights. Did not mention any other countries.
t1_dsq1ras	-0.979200	*	Follow along: a fake death threat and a fake report of a death threat are two different things. I know it must be complicated for you.

t1_dtuwe0x	-0.202300	*	That's great. As a personal anecdote, I believe you 100%. I just thought the guy above was a little foolish for making absolute statements about what *everyone* would *never* do. 
t1_dt57279	-0.296000	*	I think thats more rhetoric than actual fact. In Canada at least, by far the biggest issue was the IP provisions.

t1_dsh0o9t	-0.226300	*	All of this then comes at a cost to the consumer then. Why not just give min wage workers a tax bonus in equal value and avoid this whole mess?

t1_dsyxjvt	0.000000	*	Actually we do have a free market. What you're seeing is the natural end game of a free market when the big players simply buy or force out the competition.
t1_dskzxeu	0.820100	*	I believe that, but I'm sure our crime rate is still high compared to other first world countries. 
t1_dtwx95o	-0.886500	*	Yeah I know, wow, right? This guy is pissed off his country's presidential election was illegitimate, can you imagine? Really gives me pause.

t1_dsutn8r	0.132100	*	Buy print newspapers. NYT probably one of the most reliable.
t1_dsp1qln	0.775900	*	That's so dumb. You need to learn about the time value of money. Essentially you are giving the US government a 2k (now its 4000 with the new tax reform) interest free loan. 
t1_dtx1jjy	0.361200	*	Exhibit A: Florida  Exhibit B: Texas  Exhibit C: Ari....... fuck this, the entire Sunbelt is crazy.

t1_dsia359	0.000000	*	Oh you still think we are looking at impeach...no. We are looking for a prison sentence and it is only a matter of time. Be patient. Good things come to those that wait. 
t1_dtwvpx2	0.000000	*	strangely -- like 90% of the state is farmland
t1_dtka1bo	-0.361200	*	I think he said round-trip, which would put it at about 15 mpg, which might just be a consvative esimate, might factor in higher expected fuel cost, plus cost of candy at the gas station ... 
t1_dtq57ui	-0.604900	*	Definitely lean right, better they're no where near as bad as you make it seem. This is reddit after all, a very liberal place so its to be expected the majority wouldn't watch or like Fox.
t1_dsqdq27	0.000000	*	So youre saying I should run for office and change it? Hmmmm 
t1_dt5tmks	-0.102700	*	does your electricity automatically shut off if you go past it?    Or they just increase your deposit for the next pay period?

t1_dsjl7cy	0.000000	*	Should a goal not be to minimise hypocrisy? Talk all you want about abhorrent crimes done by other countries but don't do while trying to stand on the moral high ground.
t1_dtg6upe	-0.296000	*	You don't have to spend a ton of money on education. For the first two years, community college is damn cheap. You can finish off the second two at WGU for $12,000. 
t1_dsmmhqn	0.000000	*	We need to see that hair first.
t1_dt6i5ze	0.000000	*	Does Merkel still hate the gays and doesnt believe they should be allowed to marry?
t1_dsjjppb	0.000000	*	Oh yes, some were worse than others. Russia sweeping into Germany  and Nanking being the main ones of WWII.      But make no mistake. Raping and pillaging happens in every war.

t1_dttp0gs	-0.757900	*	I was just trying to phrase things in a way that was non-partisan.  
t1_dst2l0r	0.557400	*	Burn is the wrong word, it's more like a storage heater. Although heavy elements like uranium are mostly located in the core, so heat from their decay does play a role in keeping the core molten.
t1_dtbvh4z	0.000000	*	I mean, some of them could have been conscripts, they wouldn't have had a choice in the matter.

t1_dtbnl2u	0.000000	*	Watch out he'll screech and call you a liberal something or other again and then pat himself on the back.

t1_dsdexs0	0.000000	*	True. But the amount used in electronics is so small, the need for gold would be minimal.     
t1_dso3dsj	0.000000	*	I'm afraid that these stable geniuses are, in fact, sincere in their inane ramblings.  Source: British
t1_dtpxm2q	0.214400	*	But that's not creating a new job, which is what the original claim was.  That's supporting an existing one.
t1_dtdhsdw	-0.102700	*	No idea what you are talking about here, but I appreciate your earlier comments. Thanks.
t1_dt71ml6	0.318200	*	Do you have any evidence that would suggest a crime was committed?
t1_dthuagl	0.000000	*	You should try reading into things yourself and look at multiple sources. Don't stick only to right wing media.
t1_dtcl4bm	-0.226300	*	> Navalny  I've misread his sentence. I thought he said Putin is harmless, but I re-read it now and I see he said that Navalny is harmless, as in harmless to current russian regime

t1_dtl447l	0.102700	*	Disservice? No, the opposite. You are aware of claims that the foreskin contains the majority of the fine nerve endings found in the penis?
t1_dtoiz9t	0.000000	*	They are, but a lot of dark skinned people among them.  Btw Slav means a slave in Swedish, that was the word Vikings used to call them since they didnt come up with anything better I guess. 
t1_dt8u2cc	-0.889900	*	I mean, they could keep him wherever they want. A zoo, for example. With the orangutans. Hell fit right in. 
t1_dseh7yb	-0.599400	*	Even so, is that 'planned obsolescence'?  Or is that engineering around a flaw that occurs when the battery ages?
t1_dsjfiab	-0.296000	*	How so?  Trump needs to go for a plethora of reasons.  Collusion is only one of them.
t1_dtsxenh	-0.844500	*	This is actually a pretty common misconception. The Shi'a-Sunni divide has historically been nowhere near as violent as the Protestant-Catholic divide in Europe during the period of religious wars
t1_dtohy84	-0.865500	*	But Franco is dead ,and much like Germany wanted to separate itself from the ideals of Nazism after the war,Spain has been trying to do the same since the Generalxedsimo's death.

t1_dt2pp9a	-0.931300	*	If she wasn't a Muslim and was a JW, why did she get those threats? Were these threats from other students? And did she not complain to the police? 
t1_dso5hws	0.000000	*	Trump believes that climate change is a hoax invented by China. Anyone who agrees with this old retard is a fucking dunce who deserves nothing but ridicule.
t1_dshu1bz	0.796000	*	Pretty sure invasion is not the standard you want to set if you want Russia to look good compared to the US.  Or almost any other country in the world.
t1_dsv8rev	0.273200	*	They are plenty of unemployed Americans who would disagree with that. Using migrants just for the horrible stuff the white men is to good to do sounds like were restarting the slave trade,
t1_dsx5bef	0.273200	*	EU's right is America's Left. That's were the disconnect happens.
t1_dt8u2cc	-0.616000	*	I mean, they could keep him wherever they want. A zoo, for example. With the orangutans. Hell fit right in.

t1_dsgm4fr	-0.951300	*	Dude have you even read the bill? If you make less than $9,525 a year your taxable income becomes roughly 10-12% 
t1_dtfdd7x	-0.338400	*	Except neither Lebanon nor Syria are defending themselves. 
t1_dsg3plg	-0.482200	*	Er...prove it.  Because I'll show you dozens of people complaining about their local representative, but never lose them because no one stands up against them.
t1_dtvc4tu	0.750600	*	Youre an idiot. My opinion is fact. I think hunting is retarded even if sanctioning  it for conservation is the only positives it has. When i say no one that should be a clue as to opinion.
t1_dt4d1vq	0.476700	*	You could start with The Universal Declaration of Human Rights: Origins, Drafting and Intent by Johannes Morsink.

t1_dtfaytf	-0.202300	*	[Here's what I see.](https://i.imgur.com/NRgPNC3.png)  And yes I did ninja edit my post because it immediately started being downvoted.

t1_dsjb8h3	0.000000	*	**If I were**
t1_dsxtjku	0.000000	*	That's only half correct. Witholdings on your behalf are you paying taxes. You get that money back again if you're poor. Payroll taxes paid by the employer for paying you are paid by the employer.
t1_dsh0c55	-0.659700	*	Thanks for bringing sanity to the controversial section. All your comments made me glad there are still people who are rational on here instead of feel-good nonsense. U0001f44d

t1_dsluz6h	0.320400	*	Yep. I get where are you from? Perth. But where are you from...originally? Still fucking Perth, mate.
t1_dthhgyg	0.493900	*	Not even talking about Benghazi but nice deflection to a counterpoint I didn't even make  Project more.  Buckled in securely buddy. Plz provide evidence. I'll wait.
t1_dt54giy	-0.571900	*	That wasn't me. Did you know that you can read the usernames to tell reddit users apart?

t1_dtuf3l0	-0.275500	*	That's an impressive lack of reading comprehension you got there.
t1_dtenfxw	-0.598400	*	I mean, I agree. But from the point of view of someone with superior military power, it becomes an option. 
t1_dt91eig	-0.226300	*	I'm not sure if I follow. Are you saying 10 people should have the same amount of sway in an election as 330 million others?  Because no, they shouldn't.

t1_dsppvvr	-0.526700	*	Alex Jones really is the shit stain on a pair of grungy underwear found in a wet, rainy alley.

t1_dt582kl	-0.718400	*	So if all smoke is the same and smoking cigarettes in public is legal then by your logic smoking weed in public should be legal, yes? Or is odor enough to get something banned?

t1_dtm06ag	-0.226300	*	This is fantastic, thanks for sharing your perspective.

t1_dtrlmqg	0.617200	*	The same reason Costco constantly reshuffles their stores. It keeps you around longer to be marketed to and the random assortment of data feels fresh as the new is merged with the old.

t1_dst0xrj	0.916900	*	Collection is impossible though, people suck. Without some dystopian state monitoring everyone good luck getting everyone to be responsible on the scale required. 
t1_dswpzh5	-0.939100	*	That all depends on how early the fetus is aborted. They are closer to a bundle of cells than a human being if you ask me. There's a reason why abortions are only allowed up to a certain point.

t1_dt8u2cc	0.000000	*	I mean, they could keep him wherever they want. A zoo, for example. With the orangutans. Hell fit right in.

t1_dtc5h1j	-0.710500	*	well, do you care equally with no concern of their proximity to you? Do you care equally for all innocent killed? Because if you do your life must be hell.

t1_dtw86a9	-0.102700	*	I think it's faulty to assume he listens to anyone. I suspect he generals make and do more or less all important foreign policy because, frankly, Donny is fucking stupid.

t1_dsgx6i9	0.153100	*	You mean they don't have everything that a McDonald's has? Just a McCafe? 
t1_dsrjurv	0.690800	*	I don't spend a lot of time following twitter icons but he sounds like a decent guy. If only guys like him had more followers among his own faith.

t1_dsttuio	-0.978000	*	I don't know enough about it to say one way or the other, but I'm betting the South Korean president knows more about it than anyone on Reddit.
t1_dt6lz75	0.000000	*	But a lot of people never earned that money. They're only rich because their parents were rich. If they had been born poor, they would still have been poor.

t1_dstskq2	-0.128000	*	I would not have guessed that!

t1_dsiy5js	-0.205700	*	If someone uses the words butthurt left then it's fairly safe to assume they are a trump supporter as they coined the term.

t1_dsnxz6w	-0.296000	*	No way.  None of these people give two shits about Islam.  They just say that it to not seem so racist.  Hot Bosnian women?  They're cool with them being Muslim.

t1_dtqj707	-0.542300	*	? Like what, Trump wants to nuke it and poison half the frickin world with nuclear fallout, that is not an option. His policy is the worst we have ever seen. 
t1_dsw2vsm	0.296000	*	I believe the athletes will still have to pass individual dope tests as well, so if they are doping on something that can be detected, they still won't compete, even as an individual.
t1_dtql46z	-0.476700	*	THIS. The government is doing NOTHING to prevent more attacks on democracy because the White House is too busy pretending it didn't happen in 2016. Absurd
t1_dt10sot	-0.318200	*	I'm an American and I'm just saying your country's laws are crazy to me. In the United States we have a major debate on what is a human being. It's less 1-sided here.

t1_dso3p09	-0.985200	*	Again, it certainly can't be your fault, your problem. Deflect the blame some more. Make it someone else's fault or responsibility. Because then nothing will have to change. 
t1_dt00b8l	-0.557400	*	The secret can be kept even secreter if 3 people are dead.  That's the rumor I heard at least.

t1_dsv2vek	-0.935700	*	I think, considering his history, he is actually racist. And not just for his voters. Dude used to kick out minorities from apartment buildings, made living hell for them. This was decades ago
t1_dtmu890	-0.274800	*	Indeed, if the Republicans actually wanted to address these alleged corruptions in the FBI, they wouldn't be doing it in such a theatrical manner by publicly releasing some clearly biased memo.
t1_dt8t01p	-0.133600	*	Why does anyone need to burn a Quran other than to send a message of hate to Muslims? I personally hate Christians, but I don't go around burning the New Testament.

t1_dt695ey	0.895700	*	I don't know if you intended it or not but what you said up above was basically: Berating religious people is a positive thing. I was pointing out that line of thinking.

t1_dstr68w	0.000000	*	Idk actually, that CNN article makes it seem like Moon really meant it. Granted, Moon isn't totally in favor of Trump's approach. He says it could bring about unintentional clashes.
t1_dtuxgq5	0.000000	*	I'd still rather live in the US over China, in the US you can still write negative things about Trump. You get arrested if you criticize China while living there...

t1_dtrp4db	-0.077200	*	You took my joke way too seriously. 
t1_dtaqbhr	-0.676400	*	IIRC, that original contract was only biased against Boeing because they'd recently been caught bribing their pet politicians even more flagrantly than usual & gotten fined for it.
t1_dsismyy	0.000000	*	Bobby Sands is Bobby Sands, they're two separate words and the alphabet is the same.  
t1_dtaalyi	0.000000	*	Yea, words have meaning, and neo literally just means new.  So neo-nazis are just new nazis.  New doesn't indicate a change in ideology.  It only indicates a change in time.

t1_dtg632j	0.102700	*	I'm sure calling them stupid will definitely win them over to your way of thinking rather than educating them.
t1_dtrix3w	0.000000	*	I don't support either side, I was just making a point that picking an arbitrary point in history isn't helpful.
t1_dtoo5qo	-0.673900	*	Oh OK. Of course a parachuting PILOT is a different beast entirely. The term kind of threw me off. I would have rather used: SHOOTING BAILING CREW .
t1_dtd97kv	-0.294400	*	Fair enough. By the way, I'm noticing a trend of scores being hidden on Reddit. How and why did you do it to your comments?
t1_dtty42y	0.128000	*	Not quite. Even inequality adjusted HDI, which accounts for inequality, still lists the US quite high (above Spain, Italy etc). 
t1_dtchdt7	-0.735100	*	I see downvotes, but i don't see replies providing what you're asking for.  I don't get it.  Fucking ponderous, man. I don't get it.

t1_dtgzkc6	0.791400	*	Thats not stretching, thats basic psych and mental health knowledge.  And if you want proof: not one country with proper work life balance has the obesity rate the US does.
t1_dtsiwy7	0.880000	*	Sure. Regulations that discourage monopolies or other anti-competetive behavior like price fixing or collusion. The Sherman Act for example.

t1_dtrfvxc	0.958200	*	Yes, but it was more enjoyable when the suggested videos were based more on what you were currently watching, rather than your watch history
t1_dt9du6p	-0.340000	*	Not a great metaphor because nothing is stopping me from helping people right now. In 1942 if I am found to have a Jewish family under my floor suddenly I am in a world of trouble.

t1_dsfs8rj	0.168900	*	Already warming yes, but how much methane reaches the atmosphere? A lot of it oxidises, but i would still look at the places i linked. They talk about this stuff a lot better then me.

t1_dse6rlj	-0.210500	*	So the party that says markets always act ethically acts unethically with markets?
t1_dtdnbea	0.000000	*	Perhaps I should clarify my position. The US wants to influence the region. Whether this influence is one of stability or not is irrelevant.

t1_dsqiuje	0.000000	*	I think we're less racist now than we were. The issue is that the internet allows the small minority a much larger voice than would otherwise be possible.

t1_dtibccq	0.000000	*	Idk but I feel like it costing 2 million would be excessive.  80 million to move 76 people and equipment? Im sure theres more to it but... EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS

t1_dtadmw3	0.643300	*	He went around the wrong side in the roundabout. Also not having a license plate probably didnt help.

t1_dsp5okf	0.000000	*	Cancer research is funded voluntarily by private research companies. (With govt incentives. Un funding is through taxed income of Americans who get no say how the money is spent. Your point is moot.

t1_dt7nfub	-0.563200	*	Your explanation actually supports the fact that he is using it right!   Too much time at the pub I think!  :)
t1_dtbfi90	0.000000	*	If the resorts could grow their own weed and provide to guests, people would never buy from the tchotchke shop back room where you get ripped off for 2 grams of shit you wouldn't have smoked in HS.
t1_dtka0w9	0.000000	*	Well I mean, he would have to drive the car back too...   Also if he calculated using Oregon gas prices, those would be substantially higher than $2.58 on average. 
t1_dt740u9	0.296000	*	Low cost of living affects everyone. The cost of gas is much lower in the US than it is in Europe. Even buying a new car is sometimes half the cost due to taxes (I'm looking at you Netherlands).
t1_dsfjerl	0.743200	*	North Korea isn't confused. It's terrified. Trump is next level crazy compared to any previous contemporary presidents, and he has NK as a target and has threatened strong force against them.

t1_dtr19ri	0.000000	*	We are too kind to invade. We just plan to absorb more people and grow bigger as the US becomes more unappealing. The rust belt should just join the rest of the great lakes region up north.

t1_dtc4ce4	0.000000	*	Not even close though.
t1_dsuu6fs	0.680800	*	Its not a win win if someone is losing. That someone is the low skilled American who has to compete with the low skilled Haitian for an American job.
t1_dtgzmam	0.361200	*	Probably the fact that she plays it like shes in a minstrel show. Guarantee you her speech mannerisms arent anywhere close to how she talks, but instead creative notes from the director
t1_dtt8mbe	0.458800	*	Spoken like a true failure.  You'll never succeed, if you believe you can't. I have a successful company and I haven't even been out of prison a year.  It's not hard. Just takes proper preparation

t1_dt9oxaw	0.034600	*	Nobody else wants them. They'd have to just float around in a boat.
t1_dsn0dsp	-0.886800	*	Sort by per captia consumption and you get the values I gave you, I have no idea who is downvoting me but they obviously are unable to actually use the site
t1_dshdmnv	0.609300	*	No the article does not say that they are billionaires.  It says that their father is worth $1.4 billion and last time I checked they are not their father.  
t1_dtf8r5n	0.000000	*	And neither were offensive, stereotypes aren't offensive because stereotypes are jokes and jokes aren't offensive.
t1_dtve41v	-0.226300	*	Because killing a chicken is done out of necessity to eat. Killing a tame healthy lion has no purpose.

t1_dswn7gp	-0.318200	*	They said heroin, cocaine, meth, and you chose pot for your argument? A drug that's been decriminalized in Canada for years, and is on the verge of legalization?
t1_dtwkann	0.226300	*	Unless you can find contradicting evidence, I would fathom that literacy and mathematics skills in the deep South still give the Middle East a run for their money. 
t1_dszt6nm	-0.476700	*	In response to the edit, flesh is delicious.
t1_dsjxzpt	-0.318200	*	His dad was arrested in a KKK riot. I don't blame Donald for his father's sins, it's just that it shows the environment he grew up in and how that shaped him.

t1_dt1egcb	0.000000	*	Wait, the majority of the population is against Net Neutrality?  Is that why they literally faked all the talk about Net Neutrality? Used dead peoples aliases?
t1_dswly5t	0.000000	*	My parents don't think that smoking and drinking is moral. Should they also be exempt from any sort of government assistance?

t1_dsfkma6	0.421500	*	Just to be clear, where do you stand? Do you believe that the US prison system is the equivalent of the North Korean work camps?

t1_dt7bojm	-0.765000	*	But if we create a world where despots aren't punished then it will embolden tomorrow's despots. For the sake of future generations, dictators must face justice.
t1_dt71rm3	0.000000	*	Marginal tax rate, sure. Overall, not until $3.95M.
t1_dtrfvxc	0.695600	*	Yes, but it was more enjoyable when the suggested videos were based more on what you were currently watching, rather than your watch history
t1_dtfie4d	0.153100	*	You know very well they could have sold HL3 with cosmetic headcrabs that people would react to differently (with throw away 1 liners) and they would have made billions. 
t1_dtn17zb	0.307100	*	Yup. A lot less activation energy required to go from uninformed to misinformed as opposed to going from uninformed to informed.   Also, excited electors want to revert to their lowest energy state.

t1_dt8it81	0.187700	*	However, the headline is misleading. The funding was ending *anyway*, the exception being if they got an extension. 
t1_dsyzfiv	0.255600	*	Isnt the point and justification of pro-life that life begins at debatable stages of conception and development? 
t1_dsjhj76	-0.765000	*	I just don't think it's a cost effective method of wreaking havoc no matter how you slice it.

t1_dtjw9x5	0.937100	*	So what are you going to do, deny shelter to everyone who has a drug problem, making them live out on the streets? Because thats not going to help them turn their lives around...
t1_dt9eoy2	0.735100	*	That was great. Thanks
t1_dt72wlp	0.807400	*	I don't think anyone questioned whether a doctor deserves a high salary or not.    
t1_dt6pt5b	-0.394400	*	...so the balance would be a subreddit full of pro-trump, critical of liberal agenda articles? Something like TD and its offspring?

t1_dtdbhc0	-0.735600	*	And how would he do that? The system here is America does not allow for anything like that 
t1_dstw6dq	0.000000	*	See my other comment.
t1_dsolzo4	0.618700	*	none of those experiences are inherently religious, all of them can be replaced by secular activities that serve the same purpose.
t1_dtvpcmp	0.273200	*	And the exact opposite is true as well, just because you can subsist on veggies and greens does not make it the ideal. Your argument is as hollow as his was

t1_dtwea9q	0.891900	*	Because they earned it. There was a very real chance they would die every time they went into space. When Elon pilots his own rocket ship, then it'll be a fair comparison.

t1_dtgawdn	0.000000	*	Change happens incrementally.  Remember that next election.  Trump is trying to roll back work Obama got done, so the next Dem President will have a bigger mountain to climb than Hillary would have.
t1_dtbtja7	0.153100	*	I know, you want to retcon the Bible's insanity so you can keep believing.  It's understandable.  Doesn't make the Bible less crazy though.

t1_dtd15cj	0.214400	*	You're talking about people, not states, I'm talking about States. Either way, even with the electoral college 1 vote is 1 vote.

t1_dste9f5	0.675700	*	Indictment of the president wont happen. Period. The DoJ consensus is that you cant indict a sitting president.  Impeachment wont happen if GOP is in charge, even if Mueller recommends charges.

t1_dsp5tnv	-0.792000	*	No shit.  I'm asking you for backup for the claims you made.  You know like the audio or the news article.  That'd be a starting point.

t1_dtetzdc	-0.865100	*	The problem is that we're farming, the solution is to stop farming.  Making people stop farming is a difficult thing to do because people like to eat.
t1_dtglnlt	-0.817600	*	Oh and we will lose our jobs and go broke if we take more than a week off of work. Dont forget that bit. 
t1_dt5ci6w	-0.795800	*	So the only bar for terrorism is ISIS strapping bombs to kids? The definition can only exist in the most extreme form imaginable?

t1_dta2cln	-0.440400	*	> I think we have a better system when it comes to freedom of expression.  I am not sure Huckleberry Finn would agree with that.
t1_dsvuzpa	-0.831600	*	That 1.25 stat is only through the first 45 days of his presidency.  You can argue all you want. Bush and especially Obama laid the framework and set precedents that were ripe for abuse 
t1_dshc213	0.128000	*	Unions is why we have good working conditions in Sweden. We have five weeks paid vacation too...
t1_dsvqful	0.000000	*	Tell that to the Jews saved by Germans.

t1_dtqtqhw	0.756400	*	Huh. I'm glad you had the strength to pursue those doubts.   What was appealing to you about that sort of reactionary conservatism to begin with?
t1_dt9q61i	0.000000	*	Which is fair. If you've never done anything for the kid in your life, it may as well not be yours.

t1_dsh7dpp	0.250000	*	I swear their black coffee was good in the 90s.  My morning visit to Timmy's was: one Toronto Star, a black coffee, 1 maple timbits, and half a packet of du Maurier lights.  Legend-ary.
t1_dtc07md	0.361200	*	Because a lot of people cant do anything. There are billions of humans on this planet, its too many people for us to do much but feel sad about a tragedy that we cant affect thousands of miles away. 
t1_dt1sl0t	-0.855500	*	It's currently working for Hungary and Israel. It's a hell of a lot easier to catch someone climbing over a wall verses hiding among the plants and rocks.

t1_dsl98np	-0.801300	*	And letting those people in back then turned out pretty good for America.
t1_dswmhfn	-0.447200	*	So the Liberals winning the federal election with 39.5% of the vote means that the country has decided definitively which way it leans on this issue?
t1_dsvo6sp	0.397100	*	I disagree. It is because we have a monopsony. Too few employers, which is not the same as too few jobs. 4 businesses who hire 50 employees each is better than 1 that hires 200.
t1_dtfasyk	0.674700	*	It's still manipulation of the American public. And the United States has been caught more often than Russia has in interfering in foreign elections.

t1_dt1bkh7	0.000000	*	Which is a very important distinction, 45M+ dead is just 15M shy of a literal decimation of the population at the time.

t1_dt8vh6o	-0.571900	*	Well i havnt ever heard of that happening. We can burn our flags though.   Also dont you have to swear allegiance to the state. Fuck that shit the state should sware alligance to the people.

t1_dt8t0fv	0.644000	*	Perhaps, but that doesnt explain why they collectively ignore anything positive about Trump, which they do on a daily basis.
t1_dt0k709	0.624000	*	Well, he sure as hell didn't work for billions unless he's a superhuman. He stole that money from his workers and customers.  I'm no stalinist, Stalin was a fuck. I lean more towards anarchism.
t1_dtkxbp7	0.599400	*	In what field?
t1_dsuwlsz	0.170000	*	Of course it is a charitable decision, choosing to hire less educated low skill Hatians over other more educated low skill workers from other countries is a net loss decision.
t1_dt0ahec	0.636900	*	Oh, you mean that Russian wolf that has wandered to Norway? It's not indigenous to Norway.

t1_dsxxd09	0.102700	*	Perhaps they feel it is an acceptable loss, so long as their main strategic goal for the region remains intact.  It's not like Turkey is going to march into Damascus now is it?
t1_dsgvgoa	-0.510600	*	Oh yeah of course pakistan doesnt need that aid. Wonder why they were begging for it for the last 15 years.

t1_dtic6ba	-0.880700	*	They were caught on the battlefield in Afghanistan - most of them.  I don't believe there's been any peace treaty yet with Al-Qaeda.  When there is, we can let them go.

t1_dsvdlti	0.000000	*	It really doesn't. even if it's 2000 less people they have to chase down that's still not a noticeable difference. There are tens of thousands of people overstaying visas.

t1_dtblacs	-0.620700	*	And you believe that?
t1_dth6zm4	0.632700	*	If someone doesn't give in to demands or pay any attention to the blackmailer, is it blackmail?
t1_dt18lo3	0.552000	*	True, but also the Communist has a pretty solid hold on the military, and it cannot really act as an independent institution in the sense that it can in many other countries.

t1_dsplt3s	-0.959000	*	Palestine is democratic? Thats news to me. When was their last free election?   And yeah, Lebanon isnt a bad candidate, highest HDI, good GDP per capita. 
t1_dswm7wo	0.691500	*	What is your reasoning?
t1_dtwo0jc	0.492600	*	A dictator has absolutely power. A totalitarian relies on other institutions to be aligned with their power while allowing a small form of dissent.  
t1_dsne9uf	0.000000	*	Because we don't want to start a nuclear war. And because we acknowledge that other countries have a say in the future of the world. Sure. Grow up you fucking idiot.

t1_dsgisum	0.857300	*	Kinda funny that he opens up with an objectively false statement. Illegal immigrants aren't harmful unless they're somehow using social services, which they don't because they're illegal immigrants...
t1_dspsah5	-0.308900	*	I did not support this decision. The fact that world leaders made this decision regarding Russia does not give us an excuse to be bigoted.

t1_dtfzs3t	0.680800	*	There actually has been a push across national lines for lowering the voting age.  The best option I've heard includes a youth caucus, but that opens a whole other can of worms.

t1_dtiktb4	0.307100	*	Hardly a reason to let them leave their nose up our business. It's certainly no reason to let them have influence over Europe, especially when the Eastern part is done being under their thumb.

t1_dtvwlsv	0.490900	*	Ot is more efficient for the company, but it isn't good for the work force at large.  By that, it's not good for the employment statistics of that country.  More ot means less people employed.

t1_dtg5in1	0.796400	*	You can't blame 'people' en masse. It's the fault of the education system.

t1_dswc2l0	0.000000	*	You need to find someone who buys it for the price you want first. And then you get your money back.   However now you don't have a house and need to either rent or buy another one.

t1_dslx9gh	0.211500	*	Isn't that what you're doing? It's a he said she said argument. You're just believing the other side, you don't have higher moral ground to stand on.
t1_dspup2s	-0.102700	*	Damn, that's pretty amazing nobody died. I mean, there were basically crowds of people just having the floor under that drop, yet they all got out with just injuries?

t1_dt7gd15	0.000000	*	Really I'd figure losing your grip over the New World is important like losing India. Me thinks they just don't like to talk about their defeats.

t1_dtr0any	0.000000	*	No, what means he doesn't have a point here is that he's grotesquely misrepresenting the thimble of actual evidence he brought forward.  That other post confirms he's a credulous fool.

t1_dsnxx1d	0.000000	*	Brits tend to call everyone from Turkey to Japan Asian. I'm not a huge fan because it's not very accurate, but it's just common parlance. 
t1_dt6fy2a	0.778300	*	He also undid a lot of what JP2 did with regards to Vatican II, especially when it came to the poor. He was very anti-Liberation Theology. Francis is a Jesuit, an order rooted in social justice.

t1_dtvz4bz	0.872500	*	Yes.  That is the assumption.  There obviously is an inflection point where it's more cost effective to hire a new employee.  But that is a fixed cost investment.

t1_dt778c7	0.868900	*	There's extremely few super rich, though right?. I would think even taxing them at 90% wouldn't get you near the revenue of taxing the middle class and poor at a marginally higher rate than we do now.

t1_dtaj4zv	-0.624400	*	Yes, you can in fact sue the government for abuse of power (like an unlawful arrest).   But you can't sue someone for their opinions or if they insult you.  Understand the difference?

t1_dtq3n07	0.659000	*	Except when rich European countries have to give money to poor new joiners, even if they're not as poor as Sarajevo in 1950. That's what they don't want to do and for good reason.

t1_dswo565	0.000000	*	But like aren't those usually the youth leaders as they're able to use their authority? If so, why would they want to be able to molest people up to the age of 35?  Asking for a friend.

t1_dto9fzg	0.000000	*	That's not true, the land that was not tribal was split about 50/50 between the black and white population. (Though that was still of course unfair, with whites only making up 8% of the population)

t1_dsi9318	0.421500	*	Oh yes, I remember the audio recording of Obama talking about how he would grope men because he was the president and they loved the power he had
t1_dsyiml2	0.000000	*	Yea that would have worked if any decent brand prioritized battery time over stupidly thin phones. Until then I will keep complaining as much as I want.

t1_dt5lkab	-0.296000	*	Then that means that some countries will be poorer than others. 
t1_dttpfd3	-0.357000	*	I agree. Humanity is the worst thing that have happened to earth in it's 5 billion history. I sometimes feel fucking disgust for being human.

t1_dslxfgi	0.938200	*	This is the reason. I didn't vote because I didn't want either of them as the president. Having to choose between two terrible candidates to run the country just feels like a broken system.

t1_dsknsoz	0.891000	*	He has one?
t1_dt57450	0.000000	*	The solution is to make the law so you are allowed to smoke outside. I'm totally on the landlord's side of no smoking inside, but with so much of the population renting that's pretty ridiculous.
t1_dsepf90	0.556200	*	Water cooler 2020!
t1_dtvha3b	0.000000	*	Id say the difference is that cows and pigs are eaten,and their skin is turned into a jacket,or gloves. A lion gets shot and his head mounted on a wall,for a rich asshat to boast about

t1_dtfgim2	0.000000	*	They do in China. They pay money for white butler's or just dudes to dress up in suits and hang out at meetings. Its a status thing.

t1_dsm166j	-0.153100	*	The melting pot is our ethnicity at this point. Our country was literally built on the fact that all of us are immigrants and come from different backgrounds.
t1_dtc8z5p	0.418700	*	Why should we accept immigrants from these places? If you can't stand the backwards racists in Alabama, why would you want the 1000% worse version in these countries to be in your community?

t1_dsklzas	0.636900	*	Eh I mean I could make the statements ostriches can fly and ostriches are incapable of any form of physical movement as a species.  Both statements are bullshit even though they contradict each other.
