t1_duaijmv	0.527300	*	Indeed. So stop making poor decisions.  I used to make horrible decisions and was broke. Stopped doing so and am now doing much better for myself.
t1_dujlehp	-0.835700	*	Lots of crimes happen everyday. Why are you so fixated on this essentially victimless one?
t1_duvxon5	0.000000	*	There is also a sun reflector out there trying to divert at least 1% of direct sunlight. There is a patent for it in the United States patent office.  I'll find it again....
t1_duwo2ex	0.502300	*	American doctors have to get you stable in the ER, they have no legal obligation if you aren't going to die right then.

t1_dutn7fo	0.624900	*	Well technically, the Catholic church is the oldest, largest, systematic child abuse organisation in all of history. So yknow... don't feel like the hate is unwarranted. 
t1_duvvbuh	0.510600	*	Environmentalism isnt altruistic.  Its self-preservation vs the free rider problem.

t1_duynn94	0.827700	*	So literally exactly the same as in the US. Let me guess they also love to lie about what the gun laws are and/or wildly exaggerate their claims?
t1_duf7shk	-0.980100	*	Great. I'm not disputing that. But don't tell me hanging a pedophile or rapist from a tree is more expensive than having him live behind bars for 50 years
t1_duhgpkz	-0.585900	*	I like that hidden /s there.
t1_dut19ow	0.510600	*	And worse than almost all of the First World.

t1_dv3a4u8	0.153100	*	which is cool and all, but it's still pretty ironic that a militaristic nationalist had hippy fans. 
t1_duzyy65	0.000000	*	It'll be pretty onesided. I knew a family from South Africa in the early 2000's. They said they were getting out while the getting was good.
t1_duxn11o	-0.612400	*	I'll happily take any kind of punk gatekeeping test you want to throw at me. You still won't get me to admit that the Civil Rights movement was punk. That's just fucking stupid. 
t1_dv0i1s7	-0.223000	*	Lmfao.  Russia is an enemy to the United States.  That isn't debatable.  We're in proxy wars and many argue the cold war is still going strong.  They just attacked us too.

t1_duj4k7s	-0.226300	*	A bit of whataboutism but you should read about American foreign policy in the middle east.  Plus if he swallowed polonium openly, that's an open and shut case of suicide.
t1_dv4tweg	0.000000	*	The Trumps probably see themselves as high brow literary thespians with a keen sense of humour
t1_duo5awi	-0.877900	*	No such thing as a benign dictatorship especially one that uses Russian terrorists to bomb cities.   It should be killed off along with any of its supporters.

t1_duoayab	-0.895700	*	Yup, no such thing as a perfect leader.  I worry about Trudeau because the media's just too in love with him.  In any case, so far so good...
t1_dudxsex	0.000000	*	YUM owns Pizza Hut KFC and Taco Bell 
t1_dugpxwi	0.963500	*	Do you think that the American invasion of Iraq was worthwhile? How do most of your countrymen see the United States?
t1_duzyy65	-0.680800	*	It'll be pretty onesided. I knew a family from South Africa in the early 2000's. They said they were getting out while the getting was good.
t1_duwp6hh	0.077200	*	You can make your arguments in a concise and correct manner.  Especially when statistics easily rebuke your assertion.  http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2014.00719.x/full

t1_dum6wyf	-0.921700	*	Maybe its my army experience, but Id rather fight and die than let the horrible things that will happen to those girls occur.
t1_dumbtb4	-0.771700	*	Which part?
t1_dujopl9	-0.802000	*	So, no eyebrows raised there in the clinton camp? The investigation was legit?

t1_duk7vz0	0.051600	*	Actually, you're right. But that's kind of like giving credit to Hitler for the Holocaust museum. 
t1_dujib1a	0.880700	*	It's the Millennial generation. When a free and fair vote doesn't go their way they feel entitled to take to the street.
t1_dufgzks	-0.690100	*	I know that Chavez claimed there were multiple coup attempts. But I'm not aware of any that could have wrecked Venezuela's economy.

t1_dugply8	0.000000	*	It seems a bit silly to measure a candidates worth by their popularity. By that definition Hillary was the best candidate and the argument becomes circular.

t1_duwoebn	0.943700	*	Even as a separatist myself, you are wrong. Quxe9bec is different, but you can't know for sure is better. It's very subjective the fact to think a  nation is just better than another one.
t1_duolkf8	0.520400	*	Uh, do you have evidence that Putin was behind 13 Russian citizens being indicted? Because the indictment doesn't contain any.   Is this one of those things you just know?

t1_dum57wq	0.526700	*	I get your point, but the PRCs claim to Tibet comes from the ROC assertion that it is part of China. Just like Formosa.

t1_duiaroc	-0.585900	*	It has everything to do with it.   I can only assume that Australia's embarrassing loss in the great emu war is what caused her populace to reject their guns. Sour grapes.

t1_dulhpuk	-0.421500	*	Spare me the overly emotional pathos BS. I had relatives who actually died in those camps.  The US has no moral authority in the world anymore.
t1_dup02tz	0.476700	*	Then why are GPU prices through the roof if they don't mine it
t1_dultcds	-0.164800	*	So what's your solution there? Higher-quality food that's produced at the same price and convenience of fast food somehow? That might take a magic wand.

t1_duos7wu	0.401900	*	...and then you learn that they are financed with money from right-wingers and anonymous shady investor groups.  Seriously, I regret ever listening to their content.
t1_duuta4e	0.000000	*	same thing 
t1_dunsp4w	-0.226300	*	Yeah, his neighbor who was a relative by marriage bought them and gave them to him. There was no official record of transfer, he just handed them over.

t1_dv4d8he	0.600300	*	Often it's bad compression or no compression.    Sometimes, like with Titanfall 2, you have uncompressed sound taking a ton of space just because it helps very low end computers a bit.
t1_duqwsmz	-0.796400	*	It's because he's from California and campaign ads are known to cause cancer in the state of California so nobody watches them
t1_duble79	-0.757900	*	Iowa. You can't eat rabbits before the first frost
t1_duwuw1a	-0.401900	*	It doesn't.  We're discussing the cost of going to school in relation to the average wage a college student can make in a summer.  Area of study isn't even tertiarily involved in this conversation. 
t1_dupfwv0	-0.722300	*	It's still wrong imo. he said you can get one anytime when you arent criminal. That's not exactly true because you need a good reason to get a weaponownershipcard.

t1_dupntlj	0.265600	*	Low wage work, which is not going to pay for retirement costs. They're going to continue costing the state more money than they contribute. 
t1_dv292dj	0.611500	*	As an European who's eaten at KFC exactly once, I'm really happy we don't have it. That is some awful food.
t1_dutsx36	0.000000	*	But if he gives up his nukes, he will be relinquishing his only defense against the thing he wants least. What's to stop the US or anyone else from attacking if they do not fear a nuclear response?

t1_duxf14l	0.000000	*	That may be the case, but you go use heroin once a day and I'll go drink a six pack once a day and we can reconvene in a week to see who had a worse experience.

t1_dul6gqc	0.000000	*	His comment has too many syllables to be from Trump's base, conversely if it was a feminist supporter of Hilary she should know better than to speak out of line asking questions. 
t1_dv2n9fp	0.636900	*	Obama was a good president for sure, but calling him exceptional is a little too much.  Presidents like Washington, Lincoln, and FDR are exceptional.  Obama is probably somewhere in the 11-25 range.
t1_dv0xqpx	-0.341200	*	I'm still pulling for Brexit to lead to 32 counties my friend. If any good thing can come of it, it's that. But the hard border is a terrifying prospect if it goes the other way

t1_dui9oiz	0.690400	*	That's part of the reason. The rest of the reason is as I mentioned. 90% is a huge incentive to cheat or stretch the loopholes.
t1_duv2bpm	0.643800	*	It's as if incentivizing imprisoning people is a bad thing.
t1_duf58no	-0.458800	*	I know the 10min timer is site-wide but no other sub abuses it as Politics does.   Shareblue owns that place and they make sure to silence any opposition.

t1_dv1nwhg	0.440400	*	Doesn't hurt that the Democrats are in utter fucking shambles. Then again, they only have themselves to blame for that.

t1_dv2esya	0.361200	*	Honestly if it came to it, I'm hedging my bets on the military siding with the civilians 8/10 times. No veteran I know would ever turn their guns on American civilians in their home.
t1_duvcfwr	-0.709600	*	The soil is kind of ruined though. Its fine since its on the tracks, but with water runoff, the soil will spread. Look up night soil.
t1_duq6lnf	0.778300	*	That is not pro-Clinton.  That is post election anti-trump. 
t1_dv276mr	-0.878300	*	I was gonna take a few minutes to explain how you look right now, but you're really just not worth it.  Cheers.  
t1_duv3rp0	0.571900	*	Both have many examples.
t1_dut3hdi	-0.599400	*	Then you don't get how ingrained this is to our American culture and values. If you think the military and law enforcement would be on the side of the tyrant, you know nothing.
t1_duxnc96	0.612400	*	All i know is that it has the German green 4 plaquette (Unweltplakette).
t1_dugc5ib	-0.373600	*	Well have her try out for an Olympic curling team then, since she's apparently doing the exact same thing at the exact same intensity.
t1_dv2pa14	0.735100	*	Factually speaking, most truck drivers die of boredom somewhere between western Ontario and Alberta.
t1_duw923o	0.643500	*	Haha yea great series shit movie. But yea in most wars and whatnot local resistance can be really really effective 
t1_duyj7mc	-0.440400	*	I think it's baffling how some conservatives waffle between Support our troops! and I need a gun in case I have to kill American troops.
t1_dunfmin	0.000000	*	I dont think this is butter, it's too white. It looks more like cream cheese to me.
t1_dud2ime	-0.919700	*	Gosh I sure would love it if the GOP would stop trying to interfere with and stymie the investigation then....
t1_dv36i49	0.000000	*	If you read every other sentence it's like hopping through the multiverse.
t1_dv2fi74	-0.774400	*	I find it so hard to believe anyone would go through the effort. I think we're just dealing with retarded Americans here.
t1_dv41mda	0.386500	*	What's your logic? Because I never had it, I can never have it? 
t1_dv3cgy0	-0.895700	*	Because that is what ISIS is for, T_D isn't for organizing terrorist attacks, what a bad comparison.
t1_dv1touu	0.648600	*	> unlike in the US, european governments imported this problem  
t1_duacvyh	0.000000	*	Is that a quote or did you just came up with that yourself?

t1_dubc4zk	0.316900	*	it wont solve your problems, believe me
t1_dv37r66	0.000000	*	Yeah, no.  Not fomenting the nuclear holocaust is a pretty low bar you've set there.
t1_dugcx4r	0.401900	*	No, truly unjust laws should not be upheld before they have a chance to be changed. The rules are the rules is not ethical justification.
t1_dv5derd	0.346100	*	Wait i just realized you are saying that in birds, the males are the ones with the double chromosome.   Why???
t1_due8tm1	0.000000	*	Now.
t1_duei0qp	0.000000	*	*killed
t1_duixmio	0.000000	*	China has 1.38 billion people and has over 10,000 murders every year. Having 1000 death sentences each year seems reasonable given those numbers.
t1_duk2a36	0.000000	*	What she was saying is still completely correct, a large portion of Trump's base is made of deplorable individuals, racist fear mongers.
t1_dunr74z	0.807300	*	Trump's policies favor the workers over the rich. Specifically immigration and trade. Being rich doesn't mean you are pro-rich. 
t1_dv38xm3	0.000000	*	No it's not lmao. There's no such thing as fragile male ego. Just people who are sensitive. 
t1_duid6ql	0.294200	*	Sources needed.
t1_dv1a1sp	0.000000	*	Ah, so you just have to hope the majority of people vote for politicians who aren't bought by the organizations who want to keep on abusing their monopolies.  Shouldn't have expected much from ya.
t1_dv2pj8r	0.000000	*	there's that condescension. honestly I hope Trump wins reelection just to spite you elitist assholes
t1_duzzk9a	0.318200	*	I think he's talking about the OP. This new passing on parliment is evidence that whites may be in danger
t1_dv484zd	0.470000	*	Russia is the agressor here and is basically attacking Nato here. Nato needs to react in kind 
t1_duxrzo0	0.000000	*	Let's just say I'm in a more conservative part of the world where that kind of thing is heavily frowned upon.
t1_dudziaa	0.000000	*	you guys get paid for that? come on Russian trolls, even I could do better than that.
t1_dubsec9	-0.077200	*	Why the hell did you join the military in the first place  Edit: always fun to piss off military fanboys
t1_dv1uqpj	-0.464400	*	It was really, really [bad](http://nationalpost.com/opinion/terry-glavin-prime-minister-wardrobe-malfunctions-awful-parade-of-idiocy-continues)

t1_dunaukw	0.000000	*	Its just a common expression. 
t1_dv0soas	0.000000	*	No one knows. Everyone's just winging it and making random claims about what can and can't be done.
t1_durhhih	0.658000	*	This was very wise of Germany.  Japan is a demonstration of why what Germany does is so important.
t1_duv3cdb	0.690800	*	Hasn't. 
t1_duruuiq	-0.570900	*	I refuse to /s that. The idea of someone believing what I said is true is absolutely hysterical. 
t1_dumszup	-0.248600	*	Originally, IDK. Now it is obviously being used for a partisan purpose.
t1_dug7qbz	0.381800	*	well, who exactly do you want me to quote about Lebanese airspace. and they filed a UN complaint. have you read the article?

t1_dumomxs	0.000000	*	Are you and your friends going to be the trash or the virgins when you jump in?
t1_duzl1i7	0.000000	*	Trump is doing great, 2020 is shaping up to be a blowout! Enjoy the prosperity!
t1_dulqrmr	-0.557400	*	I thought it was pretty obvious.  Middle Eastern terrorism is only a problem because Western governments have been meddling in their affairs for generations.
t1_dv4fh4h	0.904100	*	Did they get the proper permits for building?  I live in America and you cant even build a utility pole without the right permits
t1_duhrr5n	-0.401900	*	TIL wheat & dairy are carcinogens /s
t1_duuhd9t	0.000000	*	Democracy.
t1_dud4mez	0.000000	*	We learned new things because of these indictments. But I guess Russia attacking the U.S. doesn't matter to you.
t1_duzwvy0	0.000000	*	What good is employment if you have no food or water?
t1_duknqeo	0.000000	*	Uh no, that's what I'm paying insurance for /s 
t1_dugnzn8	0.438900	*	Youre completely making this up - this is why everyone is at each others throats all the time, when people make shit like this up it helps no one.
t1_dusww8n	0.983600	*	Wow, I would have found it hilarious if I was in his place. Why do so many politicians enter the no fun allowed zone?
t1_dufoqs5	0.338400	*	Expanded on that bit, thanks. It really was one of those headline statistics people need to read into...
t1_duadsx6	-0.274800	*	i dont think 6 people actually believed in pizzgate.
t1_dv2ln5f	0.000000	*	You always wanna eat the smaller shit sandwich
t1_duzxcuh	0.000000	*	> So according to you, Muslims have more in common with Western countries than white South Africans do?  There's a bunch of muslims in Western countries.
t1_dupkm2p	-0.936000	*	But the coal causes way more death than the Nuclear option. 
t1_duic9tv	0.557400	*	Your comment has not changed my opinion about people from Sarnia.

t1_dv0o5r4	0.000000	*	If one stops, the other takes it as an opportunity and offers their stock. 
t1_dugrua7	0.354400	*	Agree with that. Was just naming one benefit of the system.

t1_duy7u01	0.711600	*	I'm pretty sure heroin withdrawal can be deadly as well. Also it's pretty bad for your veins to repeatedly inject an opioid into your veins. You're painting a ridiculously good picture of heroin here.
t1_duz7sjd	0.000000	*	Yeah, they don't have a ton of defense companies to overcharge for their services.
t1_duzyebv	0.000000	*	Just to play Devils Advocate here, the new definition of racism says that only minorities can experience racism. Since whites are the minority in SA,this still fits the definition.
t1_duc26ho	0.000000	*	It wasn't just that you saw the username, it was that every time they showed up they didn't have to say anything because everyone else started a political debate based on the username.
t1_duqiq2j	-0.296000	*	/shrugs moderates decide elections.
t1_dupr7uc	-0.226300	*	Exactly. They didn't use the artillery they had access to because the response from America would have been outrageously disproportionate (IE 'Operation Syrian Freedom' at the minimum) if they did.
t1_dusbw55	-0.526700	*	Doesn't mean shit cause you can get pinned magazines anyways if you wanted to commit a mass shooting. Lots of guns are sold with pinned mags also.
t1_dufrl6j	0.000000	*	Look it up. Im not trying to be an asshole 
t1_dv1lt4w	-0.872000	*	But it is. We don't need the right to dish out death threats and incite murder of a certain race/religion.    If you need that sooo much, be my guest. We're happy without it.
t1_duhllpy	0.477600	*	Not for long at this rate. The American left is begging to be stripped of arms. The same people who think Trump is Hitler want him to disarm them. 
t1_durk1nz	-0.883200	*	And are all those soldiers going to swim that 50km? The size doesn't matter if there are no boats to ferry men across it
t1_durgt8r	0.000000	*	Oh, we dont need to differentiate?  Sounds good to me, good luck passing anything around removing all firearms in the US
t1_dugjr50	0.000000	*	It's mostly because Americans have yet to be pushed to that proverbial breaking point, coupled with the fact that there is already an ongoing official investigation.
t1_duidbyh	0.000000	*	Source? Not everything anti-Israel is anti-Semitic. 
t1_due2kww	0.296000	*	Capitalism does assume that. Which is why there is supposed to be room for competitors. One company gets greedy, you shoo somewhere else.
t1_dusqjm3	0.440400	*	Give every citizen a gun. Its the only way to be safe!
t1_dufrir1	0.000000	*	Vwat happen....I tried
t1_duphuyl	0.840200	*	i think sooner or later it will happen. operating a relatively small military (that is ineffective in case of an actual attack) would be a waste of time and money for half the eu countries.
t1_duzy8e3	0.000000	*	If you're actually interested in looking at how objective western NGOs are...  Goes into white helmets at about 7:15:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vj_klXJoGZM
t1_dubmmsv	0.202300	*	yeah no kidding... they dominate every post, every major news/political sub, and the front page then have the nerve to claim it's a right wing/conservative thing.
t1_duiapd5	0.273200	*	And how does a flat tax that negatively affects those below you seem any better than a more effective progressive tax that focuses primarily on the mega wealthy? 
t1_dv0dcjo	0.385900	*	> 'sorry whites cant be refugees'  That's just insane
t1_duqageo	0.709600	*	I like to think of them as the majority of Americans who can't manage their environment, population, or finances.
t1_duuae6b	-0.161100	*	ninjas in pyjamas is a professional team for the video game Counter Strike Global Offensive, NIP stands for ninjas in pyjamas so what he said amounted to Ninjas in pyjamas in pyjamas
t1_dv64s89	0.612400	*	The US did pretty well out of those wars before belatedly joining in.   The Russians did more to help defeat the Nazis than they receive credit for. 
t1_duzzm1l	0.000000	*	*Country starts prepping for genocide.*  Trump: Wow, what a shithole.  *Media shrieks and whines about his statement, not the genocide, for weeks on end.*
t1_dv03p3s	0.097100	*	That's not what i said nor what i meant.  I meant to say if you take the country as a whole you get a flawed indicator for sure because nowhere you will narrow you will get these numbers.
t1_duhwca2	-0.051600	*	Not single-payer. Government health insurance is not the same as single-payer. Single-payer is a system where there is only one insurer. 
t1_dv49ecp	-0.821400	*	Forum sliding, standard troll tactic of steering discussion away from a topic they don't want to see discussed. 
t1_dv3825u	0.000000	*	Can't go back to somewhere I don't frequent? Thanks for proving my point here with your ignorance.

t1_duv9a2m	0.790600	*	I'd imagine a rail workers life in India isn't as glamorous as say a Europeans.
t1_dv1vpmk	0.102700	*	He said *people,* not states. You're saying me and my friends and family all deserve to be punished because our neighbors are ignorant?
t1_duhzhn8	0.000000	*	You know the answer.  The wealthier got wealthier, and everyone either stayed the same or got poorer
t1_dv4dwsy	0.000000	*	Not really both are valid measurements of data, just one get 8x bigger numbers. Like measuring something in seconds and minutes, seconds gives bigger numbers.
t1_dup0bp1	-0.680800	*	Heaven.

t1_dur99lj	-0.088100	*	Actually, Australia's murder rate has dropped from 1.6 per 100k in 1997 to 1 in 100k last year.  Aside from 1999, the murder rate dropped consistently after the regulations were implemented.
t1_dumisul	0.735100	*	The Americans (the army at least) didn't lose though, they were definitely winning.
t1_dv48rcg	0.340000	*	I've heard that the speeds in Australia and NZ are pretty terrible.
t1_dupibdm	0.542300	*	Maybe its anecdotal, but half of my family works for contractors that work for the military. But I know what you mean.
t1_duoa2sm	0.000000	*	How about requiring a license to own guns similar to a driver's license?
t1_dusww8n	0.527900	*	Wow, I would have found it hilarious if I was in his place. Why do so many politicians enter the no fun allowed zone?
t1_dusqfi9	-0.948500	*	That would legit start a civil war. Seriously. 
t1_dud10xi	0.987000	*	The bill gave Trump the authority to implement more sanctions if necessary. It wasn't a mandate to do so immediately.
t1_dv00ph6	0.025800	*	That's an unfair comparison. The real question would be would SA be better off if colonisation never occurred.  
t1_dv1mvbj	0.931300	*	at T_D they're saying this is another intentional part of his masterful long con.
t1_dv35j6q	-0.685400	*	No, I mean during the primaries they were pro Bernie. This was before the general election. 
t1_dv4tbvy	-0.905600	*	Saddam Hussein had a trial.
t1_duawc6g	0.000000	*	Yeah, Eddington. I think Quark guy is thinking of the whole Quark and Garak root beer exchange. 
t1_dubfhv8	0.636900	*	Stormy Daniels claims to have her version of Monica Lewinksy's blue dress, with Trump's DNA on it. What are ya gonna do if this is true?  Hope the First Lady didn't contract herpes ...
t1_duq8uvz	0.202300	*	Yeah I imagine most of them know it to some degree, but it's not quite like Australia where pretty much everyone grows up speaking it.
t1_dujcvbs	0.440400	*	Is a secular country again.  The constitution was reverted back to the original a few years ago.
t1_dudao5f	-0.051600	*	Russia paying millions to drive a wedge between us does not equal a legitimate election.
t1_dv12uwp	-0.557400	*	Yeah, thats exactly how science works. You do some research on the topic, case closed, never to be touched again.  GMOs will be legal eventually, but dont expect it to happen in the next few years.
t1_dv2zik4	0.000000	*	I'll screen shot your post, frame it, and caption it 'Ignorance' 
t1_ducu5t6	-0.241100	*	... which works because we're not wired for skepticism?

t1_dujzbtu	0.000000	*	We haven't figured out anything better yet. That's the problem. 
t1_dv0w9fy	0.318200	*	It probably does. But one needs to read those papers to know it.  It's way easier to just listen to a politician yelling I want my country back! instead.
t1_duq5oys	0.000000	*	Unfortunately all the Katy Perry hugs have been claimed. As compensation, please enjoy one free week of Jeremy Irons following you around and narrating your life.
t1_duhr28j	-0.420100	*	Yeah cause Renaissance Europe just went full blown atheist. You know with the cathedrals, the art and almost everything that had Jesus on it. Had nothing to do with it.

t1_dufkql0	-0.128000	*	Not that funny, really. The independent secessionist Chechen state was an islamist shitshow.  However, Russia's behaviour in that war was horrendous.

t1_duu90rq	0.749800	*	Despicable people will use any excuse to kill/hurt others. Religion is just one of their excuses, and a way to push others into joining them.

t1_dugok3q	0.128000	*	She's going to a prison in Iraq filled with other extremists and then gets out while she's still young. I'm sure she'll keep up her radical bullshit, instead of going on to live a normal western life.

t1_duunjhh	0.000000	*	The fact that there are no term limits *combined* with the fact there is no way for the Chinese people to remove Xi from office, would make him a dictator. What do you think China is, a democracy?
t1_dv5701t	0.000000	*	screenshotted this whole convo, no worries bro 
t1_dv3kj1h	-0.786700	*	So you're just pandering for points? Shouldn't you be calling him Drumpf or something and saying he's worse than Crooked Hillary?
t1_dui6szc	0.709600	*	You keep dancing. I asked if what you wrote is fact or is it one of the possible scenarios that may occur?  
t1_dunghv2	0.709600	*	well i've never done litter picking but i walk past fields and parks and don't see any litter really.
t1_ducfofy	-0.624900	*	Wait what does this have to do with Stalin? 
t1_dumu5n2	-0.568200	*	You really gonna claim that social media influencers ignore reddit and just dont operate here?
t1_duzzifn	0.743000	*	8% of the population owns 72% of the agriculture? Yeah, that's asking for trouble...

t1_dv1uera	-0.758600	*	Trudeau hasn't been well respected recently, the stuff he's done in the last month or two makes him look like the leftist version of Trump.
t1_dubc4zk	-0.401900	*	it wont solve your problems, believe me
t1_duipu5z	-0.984000	*	Right! So it's disengenuous to assume the protests are just against violence.    They're against gun violence.   Caused by guns.   Which are only made to do one thing.   Cause violence.
t1_duunsuy	0.000000	*	that i understand, however it seems they still take/consume a lot more fish than they should have to, im not saying they cant fish , but im pretty sure they could lower it

t1_dua4k0x	0.000000	*	Oooh you mean those kinds of supports like governmental support. But wouldnt that be payed for by the taxpayers..? Im sure germany has a huge tax bracket. 
t1_dv4vhod	0.000000	*	The bot doesn't give a shit that the post expanded their own links.  It just knows that the first set of links are too small.   Mr bot coder should rewrite his bot so that it accounts for this.
t1_dua5v7l	0.542300	*	It's not true. All gun sales, even those between private individuals, go through a licensed dealer who does a background check. This is a false myth. 
t1_dulhspg	-0.765000	*	If you're not so afraid for your life that you'd risk your pension, you don't need to be shooting anyone.

t1_dui9fsn	-0.077200	*	> For instance, the CEO of MGM had a special entry made to cover his bonus one year and make it tax exempt  Damn I didn't even know that. That's really fucked. 
t1_dud22kh	0.361200	*	I mean, after all, Trump is just Stalin the situation I believe.
t1_duppn2z	0.802000	*	And who gets to define fascism?  Because from what I've seen there's a lot of Antifa  folks who want to label anyone who supports Trump a fascist.

t1_duuq9do	0.000000	*	Tbf, I think they are in Germany for a slightly different reason
t1_dv3ocxs	0.000000	*	im from the u.k too and no thats not what racism means, hence the race bit at the front, for a nationality you could possibly describe it at the very worst, xenophobic but not racist.
t1_dum1vuf	0.823700	*	> It's neighbor...  Yes. Both the PRC and ROC claim to be china. But you already knew that right?

t1_dulb6re	-0.226300	*	I guess he was at least consistent with his behaviours. A true communist haha. But then again not everyone was equal so not a real communist?
t1_dv3bcx7	0.318200	*	People can use their opinion as to whether it's egregious or not. I'm informing people what I found. I'm not forcing anyone to do anything. 
t1_dufswv6	-0.496000	*	I'm talking about when they embarrassed themselves against hezbollah. 
t1_duuk7gm	-0.735700	*	The british left too. Why isn't Buenos Aires establishing a fishing colony claiming it as well? Are the british illegally staying on a French territory?
t1_duvnz3k	-0.822500	*	Nope.  That's 100% wrong.  Want to bother addressing all the other points, or are you going to admit that you're wrong.
t1_dui95a8	0.000000	*	yeah, I live in a huge ass 2 story house with attached garage for 950 a month, so it's all about location. 
t1_dunrmcs	0.500700	*	Yes I am also concerned as to where this apologist is from. McCarthy sent me. 
t1_duslsci	0.690800	*	Yea, what we need is a politician who promise the world to young voters based on no concrete plan and zero realistic ways to deliver even half of them.   That will get the votes going. 
t1_dupvbl6	0.469600	*	Of course she is connected to the French people, and the woman is a French citizen. This is how you integrate migrants, allow them to be a part of your culture.
t1_dude7ze	0.000000	*	The context of this thread. Republicans don't value democracy => democracy was somehow compromised. 
t1_dugvy5n	0.642800	*	> By Aragorn's time the elf part was spread out worse than a bottle of homeopathic water.  Isn't that why the third age Numenorians lived considerably shorter than OG Numenorians? 
t1_dus3ofi	0.700300	*	You don't care about facts, you only want justification for your misplaced anger.
t1_dv05251	0.380200	*	Sauce?

t1_duj0mfs	0.000000	*	Do people actually use _commie_ unironically?
t1_duqqtlc	-0.731900	*	Sorry, but no.  Capitalism is failing right now based on someday jobs will be replaced by automation.  If it's some day in the future, then it's not right now.
t1_duhguth	-0.226300	*	Does she often joke by saying I appreciate the sediment, but...?
t1_dui5l2h	0.000000	*	I'm curious about this culture of hers. What culture of hers is it you are referring to?

t1_dumx4xg	-0.542300	*	Fuck you, i won't do what you tell me.
t1_duqgyuo	0.757900	*	This still upsets me so fucking much. Why didn't we make a bigger deal about this?! They stole a whole Supreme Court Justice seat and we just let it happen. 
t1_duv2o7o	0.102700	*	> Thing is, one year later is anything really better for these folks and these depressed areas?      access to opiates seems to be improving, so they got that goin for em
t1_dui9d06	0.965100	*	That's because a lot of idiots only vote for what they are told to vote for and with more money means you can tell more people what to do.
t1_duyk61k	-0.476700	*	I've no doubt, but the question was what makes semi auto's more dangerous and the answer is that an unskilled shooter can let out a lot more rounds per minute.
t1_dv0mvn0	0.482400	*	I went as far as Diamond lake, then gave up. More bears than people.
t1_dujejmh	0.544900	*	Im coming in specifically to answer a question. Most treason convictions end in clemency and pardons. You dont have to be condescending, Im just trying to answer your question. 
t1_duool7m	0.202300	*	He's not that distinctive shave his head, grow a beard, wear plaid, a baseball cap and some old fashioned glasses.   And if you need to have him live in Canada or Australia.

t1_duob7j4	0.401900	*	What demographic do you mean exactly, children in school? Specifically targeting a school for shooting makes it a school shooting literally is what I'm getting at. And its still an act of terrorism
t1_ducvbee	0.000000	*	The left is saying Russians are trying to create chaos, and that includes attacking both sides to create a civil war, but the Republicans are allowing it. 
t1_dv129xc	-0.878700	*	Nothing I said was baseless. It's not commonly taught in the US, and my statement was qualified with probably.  Why are you so troubled by this?
t1_dulwmuc	0.624900	*	Why are you so angry? Has Vlad reduced your pay?
t1_duj3ssb	0.000000	*	How does that make sense? Being gay isn't *normal*. Literally. It's not the norm. There's nothing wrong with it, but it isn't normal by the very definition of the word.
t1_dv39iwd	-0.202300	*	That's a funny joke 
t1_duzg05h	0.318200	*	> Per capita, it's Turkey followed by (are you sitting down?) Canada at a whopping 14 per 100k.  You're saying all that Canadian politeness is just a show to make it easier to kidnap you?

t1_duxkqx5	-0.071700	*	That's a pretty shitty thing to say to someone sick enough to qualify for a medical marijuana card in a state like nj. Yeah, actually, it does suck. Thanks for asking

t1_due5mds	-0.137200	*	Is that not something positive he has done?
t1_dui1nk0	0.000000	*	They are making assumptions based on stats and trends. Of course they cannot know that you've had it great. There will be exceptions in everything.

t1_duhxla5	0.000000	*	Guilty
t1_dubs1za	0.000000	*	Yeah I guess you are right. Census.gov also says China now. My info was out of date. Thanks for the correction.

t1_dv0gwx0	0.000000	*	I have to say I don't have a ton of experience with our touristy areas. For us, thanking a serviceman is a simple display of respect, similar to thanking a policeman or fireman.

t1_dv2f958	0.000000	*	And so is unemployment and social housing. These jobs pay far more than the average job here. And have a slew of advantages such as medical for whole family, dental and stock options
t1_dv49itd	0.361200	*	I can tell you're being genuinely serious... I feel for you. 
t1_durc1vc	-0.720300	*	Greed is bad. However, in a desire to attack Capitalism, people declare any profit as Greedy.

t1_duqnk1n	0.000000	*	Important to note that this is all theoretical - SCOTUS has stated in dicta that accepting a pardon is an inherent admission of guilt, but afaik it has never been tested in court.

t1_durgudi	0.025800	*	The comment you replied to said we didnt ask to be attacked on our own soil and your response was to bring up a century-old grievance. Resentments arent an excuse for a surprise attack. 
t1_duo1nld	0.784500	*	Yeah and I think people should be free to buy what they want, and people who don't understand the topic (like children and foreign leaders) shoudln't dictate policy.

t1_dv2z7kv	0.000000	*	I don't really get your point.
t1_duq9glp	-0.367700	*	You're right, but the fallacy in that is find a country that is completely closed off from the rest of the world. What have you got? North Korea? Not exactly the direction we should be heading.

t1_duzyebv	-0.361200	*	Just to play Devils Advocate here, the new definition of racism says that only minorities can experience racism. Since whites are the minority in SA,this still fits the definition.

t1_duf0yvq	0.000000	*	Lots of the top restuarants have it on their menus and Woolworths has it in their meat section. I can't see them taking that risk if it was iffy.
t1_dudyvhe	0.962300	*	The economy is only restructuring due to artificial distortions of the market. Do you think it was beneficial for America when the Saudis crashed oil prices a few years ago?
t1_dupwc11	0.520000	*	Post-post script: Your opinion hasn't been adequately defended and has little value. I wish you had the determination to either defend or adjust your opinion, like a rational person.

t1_duyyti3	0.000000	*	But still?
t1_duz9n7d	0.526700	*	That was never in question. What is our research spending in proportion to our military spending? I'd look it up, but I don't care that much.
t1_dv1p2my	-0.765500	*	So then let's just move the 30% who didn't vote for trump to California and New York.  Problem solved, then we can let all those bigoted idiots who *allowed* Trump to win starve.  /s

t1_dusaklj	0.077200	*	Thats true, but that means Turkey knows they can do whatever they want right? Knowing that NATO cant lose them to Russia?
t1_dut5t7a	0.000000	*	Every single interaction that North Korea has had with any other country in the last year or two? It is far more likely to be as a result of pressure from South Korea.
t1_duyi479	-0.795200	*	Most Europeans don't view their governments as sleeping evil nightmares that they might have to one day fight.  They also generally trust their military enough to do that job for them.

t1_dv03c94	0.501000	*	I think there's a difference between being a tourist and illegally entering a border. It may have been an honest mistake, but that doesn't change the fact.

t1_duyg181	0.000000	*	In my state, going topless in public is a legal right that women like myself enjoy. Few women opt to take advantage of this law.  Why?

t1_dududdt	0.000000	*	Which is another stupid part of america
t1_duqgqaq	-0.390200	*	That's the Republican plan in a nutshell. Just keep getting worse candidates, and their predecessor will eventually look good.
t1_duurkn7	-0.841800	*	Can I get a name of political opponents who died?  You gave source from a hearsay though :/  If only i can get a name.  Political opponents are well known.  Much more,  those who were killed :O

t1_dv46142	0.000000	*	I dont give a flying fuck. This was about Ukraine not any other country. You can stick your attempts to complicate the argument right up your self deprecating ring piece.

t1_dumda88	-0.025800	*	Just because something is good for the heart doesn't mean it's good for the brain, particularly considering that alcohol achieves it's effects *by* fucking with your brain.
t1_dunlcbk	0.340000	*	A world where everyone agrees is hell. A world where everyone respects each other sounds more utopian to me. 
t1_dv0nal5	-0.466000	*	So you can post some child porn in the U.S.? Whoops, looks like you don't have 'real' freedom of speech either.

t1_dugply8	0.000000	*	It seems a bit silly to measure a candidates worth by their popularity. By that definition Hillary was the best candidate and the argument becomes circular. 
t1_dulj5jp	-0.360300	*	Only 62 million people voted Trump. In a country of 300 million, that means 21% of the country voted for him. Even if you go by voting age Americans, he only won 26% of the vote.
t1_dv36cyf	0.641200	*	> you can't deny that there are outside factors that are effecting the Venezuelan economy  What outside factors? If they are so obvious, then you should really point them out. It's not a secret is it?

t1_dury3kx	0.000000	*	For sure, I was just saying that it approaches it more so than Syria or Lebanon. Im not native though so thats just my interpretation. Maybe closer to Egypt Than the gulf  
t1_dubv0en	0.000000	*	> Frankly I was surprised when I learned it was an unpopular war  That's also because the war was super popular in America for a few years until it started turning into a quagmire.

t1_dura8x6	0.833100	*	We practically do that for WWI already. I learned more great war history from Battlefield 1 than i ever learned in school.
t1_dv39b3w	0.458800	*	Lot of old bernie bros like myself are on the maga train now. The dnc, Wikileaks, walked us this way and now Ive got to admit Im happy with the way things are going. 
t1_dv0qca1	0.300800	*	The common people are fine. It's the rich people with the power and greed that's gone to their heads is the problem.

t1_dugs003	-0.439100	*	She was elected though. Remember the primaries?
t1_dv48od4	-0.153100	*	We still get the exact same network congestion on fibre. I have supposedly 200Mb but it often drops due to high levels of traffic on the network. Imagine 4g/5g will be the same.

t1_dv2obkz	-0.296000	*	So then should we abolish the senate, which gives every state two representatives? Why should Montana have the same power as much larger populations like California?
t1_duuseot	-0.202300	*	Actually, I just checked Wikipedia and it said that the J-20 and J-31 are both fighters..... Although the J-20 looks too big to be an air superiority fighter...

t1_duyisza	-0.767700	*	I don't necessarily disagree with you on private gun ownership. But you are as much an extremist as your strawmen of people in this thread are.   You're not really open to change your mind either.

t1_duyi479	0.026700	*	Most Europeans don't view their governments as sleeping evil nightmares that they might have to one day fight.  They also generally trust their military enough to do that job for them.
t1_duu3ua8	0.000000	*	As much as I support the Kurds the idea that their desperate fight for survival is somehow a sign that the Muslim world rejects Islamists and terrorism is a very long bow to draw.
t1_duv0378	0.000000	*	Who wont?
t1_dugwibj	0.000000	*	It's simple.  Putin wants free reign to do as he wishes.  A strong West prevents him from doing that so he's sewing division and infighting just like he's done at home in Russia.
t1_duwoic4	0.000000	*	Oh. I don't care about America.

t1_dv1trah	0.852300	*	What was the fiasco?
t1_duq9vbw	0.000000	*	It also says nothing about owning guns to hunt or protect your property, it would be silly for the framers to have wanted that.
t1_dv3en8q	0.493900	*	Some of them have or at least at one point had sites that archived expired threads. I use to use one of them when I wanted to catch up on a comic series (since most get dumped on /co/)

t1_dv04ne8	0.476700	*	How does that compare to New York?
t1_duuwtqg	-0.128000	*	If you think that, you're literally an authoritarian.  You don't get to decide you're right and then force other people to do it your way.  Even if you *are* right.
t1_dupzpma	0.493900	*	Yes.  However, fresh out of the fryer McD fries are a delicious sin that crosses the class barrier.

t1_duaa4l2	0.000000	*	If r/europe is anything to go by, we've used up our good will. They'd happily see us 1) fuck off, 2) suffer or 3) made an example of.

t1_dupmrod	0.888500	*	Then why were you saying that it was just American liberals? You never implied that it was anyone other than them.

t1_dugjr50	-0.690100	*	It's mostly because Americans have yet to be pushed to that proverbial breaking point, coupled with the fact that there is already an ongoing official investigation.
t1_dudsu0g	-0.918600	*	No.   American medical insurers and consumers distort and inflate the cost of drugs globally. Systems like the PBS need to be more widely adopted to reduce costs for everybody, not just a lucky few.
t1_duqm3b9	0.690800	*	Ah, the good old slippery slope fallacy. It's equivalent to arguing against the gay marriage ruling because it would lead to bestiality.
t1_dv0gr3j	-0.571900	*	Don't be so sure that would win a popular vote. Americans hate taxes. 
t1_dv2n9fp	-0.648400	*	Obama was a good president for sure, but calling him exceptional is a little too much.  Presidents like Washington, Lincoln, and FDR are exceptional.  Obama is probably somewhere in the 11-25 range.

t1_dv2pqo5	-0.894500	*	You mean the way Palestinians killed Israelis before the Israelis implemented all these security measures? I'm so glad you changed your view and support mine now.
t1_duvdnf1	0.421500	*	But we're discussing cloud platforms..

t1_duyi479	-0.709600	*	Most Europeans don't view their governments as sleeping evil nightmares that they might have to one day fight.  They also generally trust their military enough to do that job for them.
t1_duuutuj	-0.819300	*	Gotcha.  Thanks!
t1_dual5wy	0.874900	*	I know it's all about experience, but people taking these unpaid internships are only telling the companies that they will be able to get free labor out of people desperate for work experience.

t1_dui8wmc	-0.079900	*	Nah, that just cause of the feminism /s
t1_dv1lt4w	-0.585900	*	But it is. We don't need the right to dish out death threats and incite murder of a certain race/religion.    If you need that sooo much, be my guest. We're happy without it.

t1_dv3a1uc	0.726900	*	I'm not the same poster you're bickering at. Also there are more elections than Trump. Pissing on those who you need to vote for the people you want is generally a bad way to do business 
t1_dugjzrl	0.000000	*	Apologies, he/she responded and has since edited it, but at the time I commented here his comment *did* say South African pirates. Misunderstanding all round.
t1_duor9hw	-0.907300	*	Comparing Clinton to felons in supermax is exactly the type of BS that Russian spread with their agitprop. Clinton wasn't a bad candidate, despite the narrative that has been pushed.

t1_duycc26	0.361200	*	If the military joins you, you can't lose. If the military doesn't, you can't win. An individual's  firearms are largely irrelevant in the case of a revolt or a coup.

t1_dufqmj6	-0.103200	*	You have absolutely no idea what youre talking about and it's sad that people will believe this as fact.  Source : I'm an airline pilot in the US and flew these prop death traps
t1_ducghr2	0.000000	*	You say bleed the Soviets like that excuses toppling a government and destabilizing a region which is still reeling some 50 years later.

t1_dv3b1mg	0.359500	*	It all started when they made the /r/metacanada mods into /r/canada mods.  That's when people started getting banned for saying things like I think at least some Trump supporters are racist.

t1_dv1rgo4	0.000000	*	A lot of Montana beef is wheat / grass fed.
t1_duic8vt	0.000000	*	I think they're referring to his upbringing (leader from a poor background) rather than how much money he earned as an adult. 
t1_dv4zosd	-0.862500	*	Sorry, I had to come back an comment about how /completely/ bonkers and dysfunctional the relationship between civilians and police in the U.S is? Flash bangs for drug raids! This is so wrong.
t1_duuwss5	-0.709600	*	But the problem is that in the media it's used wrong too. I've seen it used wrong far more times than I have seen it used right.
t1_duahgld	0.929700	*	It's almost as if the higher IQ population created an environment in which food isn't an issue and farmers aren't slaughtered daily.

t1_dv2tzp4	0.458800	*	And we have geese down here who can go fuck themselves anyway, so it's not like those are exclusive to Canada. 
t1_duhwaez	0.889800	*	And this, which completely ignores what I said, further convinces me I am right about you being a Russian.  And now you are killfiled, partly for ignoring what I said.

t1_duzy6xb	0.670500	*	Is the music any good?
t1_dujisfr	0.757900	*	It still makes a difference. Most of the rules changed by Trump's cabinet will be rolled back under the next Dem president. But calls/letters/protests will stop them from ever being made again.

t1_dujhcj1	-0.101000	*	It's not really a whatabout-ism since I clearly stated it wasn't a defense of Russia.   It's just a remark to the word most.

t1_duqvj1v	-0.296000	*	All countries are different in different ways, but calling free market European countries socialist when they are really not is just trying to attach false successful examples to that failed ideology.
t1_duzyebv	0.000000	*	Just to play Devils Advocate here, the new definition of racism says that only minorities can experience racism. Since whites are the minority in SA,this still fits the definition.

t1_duw0kz4	-0.735100	*	Yeah, true. I'm not sure even life could stop them from dying, it's a natural part of their composition. The most we could hope to do is move to a still living one!

t1_dv0sz04	-0.177900	*	Its not about bloodlust. Its about seeing death. Its a part of life we've shut off and don't have easy. Access to anymore. Its not good for the soul to ignore death.

t1_dutewuo	0.457400	*	Good thing we don't live in a system remotely close to that.   Trump was an outsider. 
t1_duploe3	0.476700	*	Elaborate please. 
t1_dur8nmb	0.000000	*	Definitely, but those are the risks. The Russians don't exactly turn the other cheek either.

t1_duvuwnq	-0.951400	*	Obligatory overpopulation isn't a problem, it's the wealth disparity and the mass consumption society of the largely stagnant (population wise) west.

t1_duo7lyy	0.817600	*	The state of Syria was already a western invention from the SykesPicot Agreement. Time to right a wrong and UN Forces can help with that and there is always someone around to govern.

t1_dv38aaq	0.663600	*	Hm, that is an interesting point of view.  This would be amplified with the state-points voting system the US uses as well I assume then.
t1_dusoqiy	0.598000	*	It's nonsense to say she was sleazier than trump. She did fail to run an inspiring campaign, or to adapt to his posturing as a radical outsider.
t1_durbw9p	0.612400	*	One definition of socialized is payed for by public funds. This is where the term socialized medicine comes from.

t1_duvwwdj	0.000000	*	Half the country denies human influence on it, and pretends science isnt real. Our emissions are down but not because of any consensus on the data, and thats the sad part. 
t1_duzzx5c	-0.765000	*	Its like that in the States too. I've never actually seen anyone be shitty to a middle easterner. Too bad our governments cant get along.

t1_duhllpy	-0.690800	*	Not for long at this rate. The American left is begging to be stripped of arms. The same people who think Trump is Hitler want him to disarm them.

t1_duunjhh	0.000000	*	The fact that there are no term limits *combined* with the fact there is no way for the Chinese people to remove Xi from office, would make him a dictator. What do you think China is, a democracy?

t1_dufyfvs	0.000000	*	Surely the public outcry would prevent imprisonment? 
t1_dur67zz	-0.381800	*	America has literally backed genocidal dictators, when Cuba was an interventionist state they sent troops to help Africans in anti-colonial wars.   The two are incomparable.
t1_dushwub	-0.381800	*	It would easily pay for itself. You argument boiled down to: it's hard. No kidding a lot of things are hard in real life.

t1_dv1zm1q	0.851900	*	But what does good for the economy mean? In terms of tangible legislation? Things like this tariff?

t1_duj1kzz	0.557400	*	You seem a bit dismissive about the greatest literary canon humanity has ever produced.
t1_dv48od4	0.239100	*	We still get the exact same network congestion on fibre. I have supposedly 200Mb but it often drops due to high levels of traffic on the network. Imagine 4g/5g will be the same.
t1_dueze3m	-0.975800	*	When will that actually become a problem? In 3 months?  6-9 months?  12-18 months??  We have time, we can create more breathing room.  Chill bro
t1_duoha1s	0.000000	*	There is a law on the books that there can be no electronic firearms registry. I'm serious. All records of firearms ownership are paper copies only as a result of NRA lobbying. 
t1_dugud5x	0.000000	*	What are the proposed replacements by the Democrats and/or the Republicans?
t1_dupadt0	0.859100	*	New London.  Cool. That is one town.   Over half of police officers in the country have 4 year degrees.

t1_duhpr0t	-0.883400	*	Man that's awful. I never did find out the sentence for those two, I wasn't there for that part of the trial, but I can't imagine they got off lightly. 
t1_duf4vup	0.655300	*	It's like a drinky and a poopy, or as the Brits call them, fountains and water closets. Silly Brits.
t1_duqgyuo	0.000000	*	This still upsets me so fucking much. Why didn't we make a bigger deal about this?! They stole a whole Supreme Court Justice seat and we just let it happen. 
t1_duobfl8	-0.235900	*	I think its unfair to dismiss their advocacy as irrational because they've been personally affected by an issue they care about.
t1_duvcfwr	-0.750600	*	The soil is kind of ruined though. Its fine since its on the tracks, but with water runoff, the soil will spread. Look up night soil.
t1_dv5zkcw	-0.734700	*	Legend has it that FloridaMan from Tarpon Springs invented it. Come to think of it, I think his last name was actually greek-sounding, though.

t1_dunqa6b	-0.431000	*	I know but I always wonder about how they rationalise to themselves, like I couldn't convince myself I was right if I had literally no evidence when someone asked me.

t1_dupqpbh	-0.577700	*	Why did they think they would retreat? The US has an enormous force of hardened experienced dudes. The Russians have a bunch of vodka fueled neophyte noobs with shitty equipment. 
t1_dusvtvq	-0.749100	*	No you don't, almost all convictions come from plea deals, if they don't get executed in the streets by the police first, that is.

t1_duekuy8	-0.920100	*	I could be wrong, but of the 3, Bush jr. was the worst. He raised the debt ceiling over 10 times during his Presidency.

t1_duxf14l	0.000000	*	That may be the case, but you go use heroin once a day and I'll go drink a six pack once a day and we can reconvene in a week to see who had a worse experience.

t1_duqfo6q	-0.105200	*	The red states are a given. This election was swung by the traditional blue states that went red: Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin.
t1_dug5jzb	0.862500	*	Do you mean circumvents
t1_duakfo5	0.699700	*	Except the US does, but only to a limited extent...  And a lot of EU member states have fairly liberal access to firearms.

t1_duqia71	-0.247300	*	Bush 2 seems positively diplomatic compared to the Cheeto, not to mention articulate!
t1_dujukaf	0.202300	*	The president lies constantly. It's important to keep calling him out and not let it be normalized.
t1_dv2mb6s	-0.979400	*	You'd think they would be held accountable by at least their home country's laws.
t1_duxp3dc	-0.768400	*	Because when CNN or MSNBC fuck up, they tend to at least admit it.  If you're trying to make this a political thing, Mother Jones/Shareblue would be more in line with what I'm talking about.
t1_dueuxuq	0.000000	*	Sorry
t1_dugvoc4	0.598000	*	He received the majority of the state votes, and the vast majority of county votes, a far more diverse reach of people from all walks of life voted for Trump.

t1_duhj6ho	0.278100	*	Ha. Im going to need a source on that one. 
t1_duusoow	0.309400	*	Sure.  The basis appears to be Bannon's speculation that Mueller is investigating money laundering, then goes on to explain in broad strokes how money laundering works.  Was that also your takeaway?
t1_dupcwjt	-0.874400	*	And I guess it all comes down to Governments all around the world, not just in this scenario, not understanding their people's wants...

t1_dus5p6c	0.492600	*	Omani. It's a plain uncomplicated gulf Arabic dialect with some Yemen or East Africa tones. It's very unpretentious. A bit fast based. Not much up and down. Not pompous at all.

t1_duqlhwn	-0.674900	*	the war criminal is articulate, and thus better than the CHEETO
t1_dub7bxv	0.904100	*	You still are confused.  There is one political party that delights in TAKING AWAY mental health care, and it isnt democrats.

t1_dugrxcn	0.680800	*	Both are not official anthems though. The official anthem of Scotland is God Save the Queen and if I were a Scotsman, I too wouldn't bother to learn that song probably.
t1_duarxru	0.921100	*	One of those things is something almost everyone has heard of. The other is cartoon porn.
t1_dv1rgo4	-0.296000	*	A lot of Montana beef is wheat / grass fed.

t1_duybaa7	0.000000	*	Yeah but what were some of the recent attacks
t1_dut038r	0.510600	*	I didnt say he was, just that as he sits in office its not a great look for democracy leading to superior leadership.
t1_dujlkws	0.000000	*	Not impossible, but if that's what he meant then he needs to be better at forming sentences, because that sentence does not mean what you say.

t1_dueeg75	0.680800	*	Yeah I get that. What I don't get is how a Reagan appointee who's actions during the Bush era that caused a recession (by your very own paper) could be traced back to the Clinton/Liberal era.
t1_dusman4	-0.177900	*	Of all our miserable failures, I'd say the war on drugs is the biggest. It's accomplished virtually nothing noteworthy.

t1_dub3mm2	-0.051600	*	You're trying to argue that because Bernie is shitty at politics that Clinton should run with her arms tied behind her back?  Whine about SuperPACs all you want, they are legal.   
t1_dui8q3o	0.318200	*	Um... can I have one of these 75k jobs everyone has? A working family of 4 might be making that combined, and substantially less if they can't afford child care so can't work full time.

t1_dui1cdu	0.000000	*	> Wheres all the money going?  You know all those people who weren't allowed to participate before? It's easy to keep wages up when you're disenfranchising in excess of half the population.

t1_dutsx36	-0.298900	*	But if he gives up his nukes, he will be relinquishing his only defense against the thing he wants least. What's to stop the US or anyone else from attacking if they do not fear a nuclear response?

t1_duk7yyn	0.273200	*	Oh very interesting! It's almost like the term clean coal isn't very truthful. I bet you think green energy is a waste of time and dont think the US should cut its military budget.

t1_dur5itd	-0.102700	*	We look at Venezuela and think it couldn't happen here but it could. I don't think the collective we have the backbone to fight it. Too cozy

t1_dugf0sj	-0.273200	*	One small caveat, military cuts would not cover 1.5-2 trillion dollars.  Military spending is only about 16% of the budget.  84% goes to other crap.

t1_dv5qixm	0.493900	*	Atleast pull them into the common market. This would actually give the canadians a viable alternative to their US export dominated economy?

t1_duhk2k3	-0.341200	*	I stand by what I said. I agree others are great.  I still think America is the best overall.  It blows the UK and Monaco out of the universe with house size/price just off the top of my head.

t1_dv1y3yb	0.771700	*	He was elected and the country split. It was already fractured.   Lincoln did more than any one President to save the United States as it is today.
t1_dusf7ca	-0.153100	*	He wouldn't be elected, but Trump would if the economy is good.
t1_dusoqiy	-0.654600	*	It's nonsense to say she was sleazier than trump. She did fail to run an inspiring campaign, or to adapt to his posturing as a radical outsider.
t1_duy13gx	0.000000	*	Are you seriously talking about the lack of long term vision and / or investments in a thread, which started by mentioning Apple?  Please, spare me of your blind -- at the very best -- pathos.
t1_dulnf2w	0.000000	*	Maybe it is.   Edit: please opine about international diplomacy, dear Reddit barista class. If Trudeau slighted Trump like this you'd all have an erection lasting longer than 4 hours.

t1_dus8nxt	-0.493900	*	Not wanting unskilled persons to illegally enter the country isn't white supremacy. 
t1_dur80cn	0.000000	*	Because what the Germans did with the refugees was really stupid, so either Germans are inherently stupid, or they're just stupid when clouded by guilt. 
t1_dudbq48	-0.263900	*	Why does everyone think I'm a Trump supporter? Lmao liberals are hilarious. Not everyone is a part of your limited 2D paradigm.

t1_dugcgpc	-0.831600	*	He is supporting h1bs now and there is no racial component, so it doesn't matter if he is personally racist.  Indians will continue to exploit h1bs to get entry level jobs in the US.
t1_duq9ab9	-0.077200	*	*Developed* countries. The US ranks above *developing* countries and behind most developed countries.   South Sudan is an *underdeveloped* country without much of a functioning government.

t1_duio7pa	0.933700	*	Part of why unions in Germany work that way is businesses negotiate in good faith with unions there. Here in the US... not so much. So the unions have zero incentive to cooperate.

t1_duxn11o	-0.340000	*	I'll happily take any kind of punk gatekeeping test you want to throw at me. You still won't get me to admit that the Civil Rights movement was punk. That's just fucking stupid.

t1_duzyebv	-0.624900	*	Just to play Devils Advocate here, the new definition of racism says that only minorities can experience racism. Since whites are the minority in SA,this still fits the definition.

t1_dur57tj	0.296000	*	And you need to understand its language.

t1_duz9n7d	0.781000	*	That was never in question. What is our research spending in proportion to our military spending? I'd look it up, but I don't care that much.
t1_duuk79x	-0.864300	*	You know why? I prefer we don't have World War 3, thanks. Heck, I prefer China doesn't invade other countries and kills people.  
t1_dv2gi0v	0.226300	*	I'm curious as to what part of the country you're from.  You keep using the word village instead of town or community or city.  It's interesting.
t1_duo83s0	0.000000	*	Just because someone said something false in a movie doesn't make it *correct* now. Truth is more important than pop culture references...
t1_dupqmaf	-0.401900	*	Germany is pretty progressive but we lack in so many other aspects compared to our European neighbours. Our digital infrastructure is one of the worst in western Europe.  Its a shame.
t1_dv00m78	-0.715800	*	Of course, but the fact that Cuba *has* improved makes /u/4t0mik's assertion wrong.

t1_duasig3	0.095600	*	They had a refurendum to leave and they chose to stay. Their chances are better with england than by itself.

t1_dufk5cm	0.510600	*	I know this is a favourite circlejerk on reddit, but there are many CEOs (and board of directors) that are actually ethical people. 
t1_duoyo31	-0.557400	*	Reparations help make up for what happened. How can you not understand that paying Armenians back will help set it right? 
t1_dv2kv3u	0.670500	*	I don't think the consequences will be drastic, it will certainly be a damper on EU-US relations. Whether this is good or bad is up to you, I certainly welcome it. 
t1_duwly04	-0.611400	*	Every time they proposed an increase, students here fought it. It's a 40-year struggle. That's why education in Quebec is so much more affordable than the RoC.
t1_duwd860	-0.483600	*	Who said otherwise? It'll be uncomfortable and lacklustre for a while though, and you know what? I live here and would rather that it wasn't like that.
t1_dulwiep	-0.876500	*	I'm a bit confused by your post. Did you just say it never says 18,000 and then point out where it said 18,000?
t1_dv39nb1	-0.275500	*	Im not moving anything, he busted out but muh popular vote! As if that matters.   Democracy wasnt subverted just because the orange idiot won instead of the female idiot.

t1_duc2qes	0.896900	*	99.99% of all humans are dead, don't act as if humans dying is some grave tragedy. See how that works? Something can be bad in one context that is normal in another.
t1_duqxavx	0.750600	*	Thanks for as always, being so poorly educated and informed, and unable to understand the difference between *socialism* and *communism*.  But we don't expect much out of Americans.

t1_duzfaz9	0.812200	*	When you can actually refute what I'm saying, try. So far you've just insisted China is somehow on this magical un-ending rise that defies the laws of nature.

t1_duqmp6c	0.318200	*	You just described bribery. Which is corruption.  You're supposed to give to people you support. To expect a return on investment from donations goes directly against the idea of a donation.

t1_dubomg0	0.000000	*	How is this administration not conservative? Trump panders to conservative crowds and conservative news outlets touted him.   While he came in to drain the swamp it is in fact more swampy than ever
t1_dut5t7a	0.000000	*	Every single interaction that North Korea has had with any other country in the last year or two? It is far more likely to be as a result of pressure from South Korea.

t1_dusz96i	0.361200	*	Putin steals a lot more than just money from oil. He launders money from just about every Russian industry to line his pockets to preserve his power. 
t1_dupq6pt	-0.648600	*	Also the idea that us bases are enough to protect a country is laughable

t1_ducnn3e	0.273200	*	Well, so long as it's somewhere we don't care about. To America's credit, we try not to bomb civilians. We can do better, but at least we try not to.
t1_dumfij0	0.361200	*	People just want at least hear some acknowledgement that it is happening to boys. But I guess that makes me an asshole redpiller. 
t1_duuro8q	-0.451500	*	They should be unwelcome. But you should care about the difference. It's important to be thoughtful about what you oppose.

t1_dup2xt3	0.000000	*	who the fuck downvoted you for this?  lol
t1_dusutv8	-0.226300	*	That's not how it works. Because of the human rights violations and other crimes, the only things stopping us is the nuclear weapons they have. Nothing else. 
t1_durdqrm	-0.599400	*	They committed one of the classic blunders.  Never get involved in a land war in Asia.

t1_dugrxzl	0.168000	*	But just because your city has a million plus, my city may only have 20,000. I deal with completely different issues than what goes on in your city and vice versa. 
t1_dunr5fw	0.338200	*	If being against fascism is all that you are about then you've placed the bar equal, or if we're generous, slightly above their level. That's a very low fucking standard to apply to yourself.   
t1_dv3jcyl	0.492600	*	> In most cases, recidivism works.  I don't think that word means what you think it means.
t1_duwm05k	-0.943200	*	No. It's not vague. In my field, as mandated reporters, children and their families are investigated and temporarily removed from the home for all type of reasons.

t1_duujsje	-0.683000	*	Still it sounds like it was quite outdated even for the 60's.. I find it almost unbelievable that a WWII era ship was retired in the 21st century

t1_duqcrwu	0.361200	*	Haha what a retarded response. That fact you think you sound smart is amusing.
t1_duwbfs9	0.000000	*	Idk I figured it was the average third world Asian country. Somewhat westernized cities, everywhere else is a shithole. 
t1_dued8m3	0.000000	*	sounds like you need to go to a different doctor.  no doctor should be agreeing to any contract to prescribe a drug that isn't in the best interest of the patient. 
t1_dugxvpg	0.168000	*	I mean one of us is getting downvoted a decent amount so I'll just take my win and leave.

t1_duxkwm8	0.718400	*	And written Portuguese from Portugal is pretty different than that from Brazil. It's markedly different than English in the US and England, for instance. 
t1_dul386z	0.000000	*	You can order pretty much anything online and have it shipped to your door. Also, I have never done that Im only role playing online.
t1_durjgv4	-0.868900	*	> The Allies didn't kill millions through bombing either.   Did I say millions died? I said millions were burned.   
t1_duyi479	-0.865800	*	Most Europeans don't view their governments as sleeping evil nightmares that they might have to one day fight.  They also generally trust their military enough to do that job for them.

t1_dugjsca	-0.578900	*	You didnt address anything I said. I thought we could actually have some discourse.     You had no factual or informed rebuttal, just let off a bunch of rhetoric. No evidence to back your claims.
t1_duafukr	0.000000	*	Not paywalled for me, perhaps you have exceeded your limit on that site?
t1_ducpcy4	-0.517100	*	One key difference is that it is legal for FB to sell political ads targeted at the US to the American political organization. It is not legal for them to sell them to foreign ones.

t1_duspbvz	0.827100	*	Then maybe the neutral people should be fighting for what they think is best, rather than refusing to take action by being neutral?

t1_dv3ecok	-0.694300	*	I was with you until you said it was actually great for 12-18. No bro. I don't want my kids to go on 4chan. Not ever. Memes and raiding are a shit substitute for sleeping and being happy.
t1_duqpbmc	0.000000	*	His post history is not really that of a troll. In fact, I think he's legitimately not doing so well.

t1_dui96ro	0.025800	*	Nobody should feel sorry for people in the 150k range, but IMO that's also the wrong range to go after for substantial tax increases.

t1_dup0xbv	0.401900	*	can you see your sphincter?
t1_dv0w9fy	0.401900	*	It probably does. But one needs to read those papers to know it.  It's way easier to just listen to a politician yelling I want my country back! instead.
t1_dufhfvs	0.000000	*	I feel like you took that a little extreme there.   When I said extra. I meant excess skin. As in you could remove it and still be completely covered in skin. 
t1_due1xg7	0.153100	*	Then please go ahead and provide me with the correct version.
t1_dv240jl	0.000000	*	You don't understand the meaning of the word scope.  The operation is large at very low cost, but the scope is the same.

t1_ducsi1n	-0.536500	*	No its an alliance. They have interest in stopping disinformation
t1_dutpaoq	0.000000	*	The interesting thing here is that you're calling me a Russian bot, but your punctuation indicates that you aren't even from the United States.
t1_duh1ptx	0.000000	*	No, you were intentionally using it as a derogatory term.  Theres literally no debate to the fact that its used with a negative connotation. What is the point with trying to lie about that?
t1_dutgils	0.000000	*	No I said my mom does. I've talked about it with her but it was a while ago so I didn't remember correctly. I'm sorry I should've said anything..

t1_duor8lu	-0.476700	*	Countries have worked with traffickers before to import drugs to their own people before, specifically the US. This isn't a crazy idea that the Russians were involved, just not that one Ambassador
t1_duqkzar	0.000000	*	Lmao is this how you normally act when you get called out on your bullshit? Seems childish. Have fun playing Minecraft all night. 
t1_duxq5qz	0.000000	*	Mate come on..the logical part is not *oppressing* those who choose not to participate.
t1_duhz6yv	-0.202300	*	62% is a relatively wide victory, but not at all unanimous.  It was a poor word choice.

t1_durlxen	-0.356600	*	Yes its called actually living in America. Believe it or not opinions on the news and internet dont accurately portray a day/week/month/year in the life of someone who spends everyday on our soil.

t1_dugenl7	-0.790600	*	These are economic migrants, not refugees. Israel has accepted a huge % of its populations as refugees. Far more than America or Europe.   I'm trying to fool you? You just lied about sterilisation.

t1_duk7yyn	0.243900	*	Oh very interesting! It's almost like the term clean coal isn't very truthful. I bet you think green energy is a waste of time and dont think the US should cut its military budget. 
t1_dudtzbo	-0.709600	*	 The insurance companies love it. They take a %age off of healthcare costs. The only way they grow(outside of population growth) is through inflated healthcare costs.

t1_duno0nk	-0.296000	*	Of course only people with proper paperwork have human rights.
t1_dup0lif	0.318200	*	That makes no sense.  Fascism is a specific ideology. One that doesn't allow for peaceful coexistence. Do you also believe that fighting ISIS makes you an islamic militant?
t1_duimgcg	0.585900	*	No one suggested that. But I do get taxed on my house.
t1_duqvcxf	0.000000	*	> Why should NY and Cali get to rule Texas, and every other state just because they're so populated?  Why should Texas get to rule Cali and NY in spite of having fewer people?

t1_dv04dyf	0.000000	*	Oh don't worry, I believed you that communists (yourself included?) would say that. That's not the message I was trying to convey though :)

t1_dugrg32	-0.476700	*	Minor clarification: he's good at campaigning at becoming a politician.  The actual work of politics, not so much.  
t1_dupc9bj	-0.859100	*	That makes sense, but maybe to reduce accidents with kids still learning muscle control, we give 9/10 kids blanks. So the teachers know that a few kids in the class are packing real heat.

t1_duxkt6m	-0.743000	*	You have a narrow view of history. Atheism is a very new concept.  Humanity is still in diapers.

t1_duqb8ka	0.000000	*	I'm going to assume you're joking because I can't name every ignorant leftist that thinks I shouldn't be able to own a semi automatic handgun. How about Jimmy Kimmel's tears.

t1_duprstl	0.527100	*	Why didn't people just cross somewhere else in Germany? Why pick Berlin to try and get to the west?

t1_dud21if	-0.585900	*	Bernie voters repeated all kinds of bullshit about Clinton. We need to come to terms with that. I was a Bernie voter, but Bernie's fans both online and IRL were not always an admirable group. 
t1_dui7g69	0.608800	*	Cool man, you're doing something really great and that's awesome. People still shouldn't pay less tax on activities that offer society very little.

t1_duyr0sr	-0.847000	*	>Are you saying every South Korean soldier that died in battle is a war criminal?  You are saying something like those far-right Japanese politicians who visited war shrine of WW2 said.

t1_duqy7zl	0.202300	*	Doesnt mean its true. 
t1_duwh0ns	0.340000	*	So you found out that the guy was wrong just as i did.  Enlighten me why we shouldnt assume human beings has the capacity to figure out such things independently? 
t1_duj2yvh	-0.169500	*	Its not often you hear straight people droning on about their sexuality, when gay people on the other hand pretty much act as if being gay is their major identifying trait, like its a party trick

t1_duly49i	0.273200	*	Well then why couldn't *both* be true?  France is there to save the people of Mali **because it is in their best interest**. 
t1_dujt1hw	0.872300	*	Thats the very definition of NOT having skin in the game. They put the taxpayers skin in the game instead of their own. 
t1_duxhcog	0.000000	*	Yes, not yet.   Any you're absolutely right on the tax deals. I mean, state-aid being illegal is basically the first rule of the EU.

t1_duqjczu	0.476700	*	The Right has always held up crooks as their heroes. G. Gordon Liddy got tons of Fox time too, and Roger Stone is STILL doing his dirty tricks for the white house, like 50 years later.
t1_duky2d6	-0.340000	*	>Missiles fired at Japan? Over Japan, more correctly, at almost twice the height of the International space station.  It's cool dude! I wasn't shooting my gun AT you! Just NEAR you!

t1_dupv610	0.000000	*	You can argue with someone without calling them a liar. Grow up.
t1_dv397tj	0.340000	*	The government cannot compel citizens' speech.  This is a similar principle to the Pledge of Allegiance in schools case (West VA BoE v. Barnette).

t1_dugs6ye	0.969400	*	That's very close-minded, you're kind of assuming you hold the ultimate truth and thus a system that disadvantages your kind is flawed. 
t1_dv1m4l2	0.769800	*	Lol those people living in the most poverted areas in the world's are not consuming much of anything. I don't know where I came into play here, i use steel all the time.

t1_dudiiaj	-0.746100	*	Or you know, they didn't want a criminal who had tampered with the DNC election process in charge of the nation. I mean it COULD be that Hillary Clinton was actually a worse candidate than Trump. 
t1_duq8f94	0.000000	*	Care to cite the poll? Because I know which one it is and it isn't worth mentioning.  Edit: If you couldn't guess, it was Rasmussen
t1_duwi4bk	0.121000	*	If you click on the link you'll see the total amount of emissions which of course, accumulate on the atmosphere.

t1_duxfx6p	-0.485400	*	Well than If you are a US citizen than good for you, I guess the US government will let you keep your sword and muzzle loaded, black powder musket just like the lawmakers back in 1791 intended. 
t1_dus0jav	0.184800	*	Almost every large or medium population centre in north america will have a school or two, but many will be oriented to classical arabic (arabic used in the quaran).

t1_dunlc1l	-0.296000	*	Again, the difference is that a town hall is not a speech 
t1_duu4ajo	-0.440400	*	40% isn't a bigger car or a bigger house...it's being homeless or not.

t1_dukjrh7	0.374400	*	Well, I guess one of the reasons is fact that american culture is very strong. We love stuff like Godfather and I think it makes some people interested when they see a cigar. 
t1_duqevas	-0.966500	*	If my girlfriend wakes me up with a blowjob without my consent isn't it technically rape and by your logic as bad as someone attacking and raping me on the streets

t1_dudu74g	0.000000	*	And what powers does the Belgian goverment have to enforce that ruling?  If the company is outside of its legal reach there isn't much the Belgian goverment can do. 
t1_dv2745y	-0.716900	*	Funny, for all the talk about Mexico hurting the US all he has done as President is impose tariffs on Canada. 
t1_dua7tb4	0.000000	*	And yet we have still developed civilisation, not because of violence but in spite of it. Heard the say ng it takes a village to raise a child? 
t1_duntlys	0.000000	*	I fold them into tacos filled with butter and (corn) syrup.
t1_duxl8ui	-0.340000	*	Only amendments can change the Constitution, although the Supreme Court could just say that passage means everyone gets donuts and legally it would be so
t1_dv2q4zp	0.308900	*	[Okay...](https://ei.marketwatch.com/Multimedia/2016/03/04/Photos/MG/MW-EH199_djia_o_20160304140141_MG.jpg?uuid=87ea2978-e23b-11e5-8936-0015c588e0f6)
t1_dujmems	0.000000	*	It's funny when you have no rebuttal you just pretend you're above the conversation by being a sarcastic dickhead. You're welcome for my contribution.
t1_dv2y2h4	0.012900	*	^*cough* James Buchanan ^*cough*
t1_duh6sql	0.440400	*	This comment is creeping me out

t1_dueoft7	0.000000	*	It's not.
t1_dv2abfg	-0.631000	*	It makes me so mad that every day I convince myself that he cant be any fucking dumber than he already has been but then he proves me wrong.

t1_duvydiu	-0.919200	*	The idea is just not to be wasteful. Massive polluters are the  biggest problems but when the masses waste resources it certainly doesn't help.
t1_dusshe8	0.510600	*	Yeah. Over in the US, you can vote for the very representative totally-not-puppets of corporate lobbyists instead.

t1_dunkeh9	-0.571900	*	If one of the things you disagree on is the fact that you think he should be deported,  then yes, it means he should probably hate you despite your shared fondness for cookies.

t1_duasxn2	-0.706100	*	Use the word respectively in that case.   As to the sharp drop? I'm not exactly in a position to have stockpiles of foreign money in case I travel and I'd say that's hardly rare in the UK population

t1_dudu3dz	0.637200	*	Okay, they can rule as much as they want, because that doesn't mean Facebook is going to do it. In other words, this is a valid question.
t1_dushtk7	-0.742500	*	The great thing about this comment is that both pro and anti Spring folks will upvote it thinking it's supporting their side.
t1_dur99cp	0.648600	*	I don't think civilians possess the firepower, surveillance technology, and composition to overcome the top military superpower.
t1_dursss4	-0.709600	*	None of those articles support the claim.

t1_dub6mo9	0.000000	*	So it is entirely one sided, only Russia attempts to meddle in Americas internal politics, the US in now way attempts to meddle in Russia's internal politics? 
t1_duv17hh	0.000000	*	And of course the USA would always allow state sponsored terrorism.

t1_dujbj5g	0.440400	*	yes and i can call them out as assholes and bigots. Hopefully they can be revived later on and tortured for eternity by AI
t1_dubmmsv	-0.541100	*	yeah no kidding... they dominate every post, every major news/political sub, and the front page then have the nerve to claim it's a right wing/conservative thing.
t1_dupzmnk	0.219700	*	So how well is your peace and love doing for the palm oil industry?
t1_dup2brn	0.000000	*	Thanks. My day is done.

t1_duhuag6	-0.177900	*	I'm just checking that you're aware that Shanghai and Hong Kong are not the same city, because the article you linked to clearly talks about Hong Kong...
t1_dumottc	0.000000	*	ELI5 why this is a bad idea? This and the sun one but I imagine the sun option will cost too much to shoot up there.
t1_duqr5yo	0.381800	*	Never heard of the Russian war with Afghanistan?

t1_duqc1kl	0.421500	*	>We've had enough of immigrants.  We need to expel all Muslims from our country.  The ol Republican special.
t1_dua9giq	0.324400	*	That is also my logic, but people like to feel like they are doing something.  Currently jkldh;lksuiogu;'sfg: Do you want to do something or do nothing?
t1_duzyebv	-0.612400	*	Just to play Devils Advocate here, the new definition of racism says that only minorities can experience racism. Since whites are the minority in SA,this still fits the definition.
t1_dv0xrg1	-0.793200	*	Yeah, I was about to say I doubt the Irish would be happy with Brits doing anything short of getting fucked.
t1_dv1a2h1	-0.986200	*	In my opinion yes, he was imprisoned for something he should not have been, and died in the states care.
t1_duz0kw6	-0.296000	*	I don't think it is at all. The person wasn't talking about hypocrisy. You're the one who interjected that as if it was relevant.
t1_duj103y	-0.923900	*	I could easily see people doing that as a joke tbh
t1_dui167x	0.350500	*	I've heard the argument that when women joined the workforce, that doubled the size of labor; therefore, wages halved.
t1_dv3ocxs	-0.401900	*	im from the u.k too and no thats not what racism means, hence the race bit at the front, for a nationality you could possibly describe it at the very worst, xenophobic but not racist.

t1_dudtrvs	0.735100	*	Academia still requires funding for research as well.   The teachers and students still gotta live too and have bills and necessities that require money. 
t1_dv03sv7	0.000000	*	Unless you're preaching neonazism, you'll be fine regardless of what you talk about in Canada...You might offend some people, but you won't be going to jail or be unsafe.
t1_duldgbg	-0.577000	*	>Sure, all the land belongs to Israel and Palestinians have no rights at all.  This is the post you replied to.   You are deflecting. 
t1_duwohsm	0.584900	*	The closest thing I know of to a free market is the Old West in the U.S., and it was a hellhole.
t1_duo5awi	-0.942300	*	No such thing as a benign dictatorship especially one that uses Russian terrorists to bomb cities.   It should be killed off along with any of its supporters.
t1_dv39bqg	-0.432900	*	Well of course the subject isn't Bernie, the argument is that basically it started as an anti-jerk (so to speak) about Bernie.  The link doesn't really prove or disprove that at all
t1_dubg7mm	0.778300	*	The cheapest way to get yogurt is to make it yourself, and you're looking at 150 for 1L milk.
t1_dukkcmp	-0.612400	*	Don't pull a Conway and try to deflect, you buy in to all of those alternative truths too don't you! Caught you redhanded.
t1_duuvlqh	-0.680800	*	>To be fair the japanese live on an island.  yeah and? Does that excuse them?
t1_durct2r	-0.340000	*	You seem to be missing the fact that Colombia and Mexico have massive gun control as well. How is that working out for the law abiding citizens?
t1_duog7x2	0.000000	*	Iceland's doing pretty well for itself.
t1_dv22vwy	0.614500	*	Leaving the UK shits on our economy more than leaving the EU ever would.   
t1_dutjnli	-0.421500	*	I think shingles (sp?) is like adult onset chicken pox. However I may be mixing shingles up with something else.

t1_dv17ewn	0.580300	*	While the US has its share of faults, a lot of Europe is pretty backwards when it comes to freedom of expression.  Le Pen's *true* crime is that she hurt the feelings of a particular type of person.
t1_dv2vk8w	0.624900	*	Lol
t1_duoyobq	0.557400	*	You have to remember, safety was a huge priority for the Americans since the PR involved with astronaut deaths was massive compared to the Soviets.
t1_dusmfin	0.000000	*	I don't think you're weird, just a bit misdirected. 
t1_dul65gm	-0.605300	*	If its free, then youre the product. in this case a misinformed and easily manipulated populace...
t1_duuicn2	0.000000	*	Nuclear propulsion or payload? Either sounds like a terrible idea for the rest of us.  Edit: I mean for the submersible mines
t1_dugao6g	-0.423800	*	So to you, there's no difference between a migrant and a refugee? Is that what you're implying?
t1_duhzi9g	-0.077200	*	That money is being hoarded by the 1%. 
t1_duhg1u7	0.458800	*	I guess that perspective is quite dependant on which state you live in.

t1_duje19g	0.077200	*	Its saying. Don't be such a fucking cynic.   
t1_duv4sek	0.077200	*	You've never heard of them because they're not commonly taught because it goes against the narrative of ROK = democracy, DPRK = evil Commie dictatorship. That's not an accident
t1_duh2wja	0.836000	*	I missed that one
t1_duh7jqz	0.000000	*	Assuming you're alluding to the Branch Davidians... Wasn't it the ATF? Or was it a joint task force?

t1_duhkqd1	0.025800	*	Right, like those pyramids in Central America... Oh, wait...
t1_duz6roz	-0.229600	*	That is most definitely not facism.  I believe you are referring to corporate oligarchy or corporatocracy.
t1_duqb8ka	0.653100	*	I'm going to assume you're joking because I can't name every ignorant leftist that thinks I shouldn't be able to own a semi automatic handgun. How about Jimmy Kimmel's tears.

t1_dv4i0x8	0.273200	*	I'm Irish.   I meant in context of the troubles.  We want peace With the NI  Catholics. *Builds another Prodestant town.*  I think Thatcher leaving power was an important step as well. 
t1_dv4wp09	0.680800	*	Dude, you are so far behind man. Nearly all of your talking points are week old propaganda, null and void. Things have really picked up pace. Take the weekend to catch up.
t1_duh1num	-0.510600	*	 It's equivalent to pleading guilty and getting no punishment... in the federal case.  Which would make the state case a slam dunk
t1_dukz68c	-0.318200	*	I just kicked a baby riding a puppy and screamed racial obscenities I am so enraged. I love puppies and am not racist so this should emphasis my rage

t1_dv1mpiy	0.000000	*	I'm preeeeeetty sure the 'date' was always 'the day that Britain leaves the EU'. I can't imagine anyone saying that Brexit will be disastrous for Britain before Brexit happens.

t1_duvc2x4	0.401900	*	Thanks for writing all this out. I'm thoroughly confused but I'll take your word for it :]

t1_duuejgx	-0.700300	*	I would say that you are wrong, even more ironic when you bring up statistics. You are likely to get more accurate results when counting large numbers unless you assume a bias in miss counts.
t1_duzydxw	0.000000	*	Oh, did I understand something incorrectly? Please educate me then.
t1_dv2ict5	0.401900	*	The point though, is that somebody, somewhere has to absorb the price difference, and it's not going to be the contract owner.

t1_duye2xt	-0.421500	*	> Yes, because we all know that making it harder tyo vote never makes people throw up their hands and say fuck it.   I certainly hope it does for the people who weren't legally eligible.

t1_dujee4t	0.445200	*	Lmao, no it's because it's hard. If it were easy, it'd be done. And no, many major cities are trying to sustain their shitty public transits. Billions are spent each year on crappy service.
t1_dutjnli	-0.361200	*	I think shingles (sp?) is like adult onset chicken pox. However I may be mixing shingles up with something else. 
t1_dv1z4fk	-0.051600	*	IMO he didn't release them because we would see who controls him, not because of taxes
t1_dv15u5a	0.000000	*	They pay me handsomely.
t1_duj45x6	-0.381800	*	Damn... that's bloody terrifying. I wonder was the precursor to all this was? What happened centuries ago that caused such a wide spread anti-social (i guess you could say) mentality.
t1_dur1wt4	-0.726900	*	Not quite. There is a special way in which these Marxist attempts fail and create humanitarian disasters ... everytime.
t1_duans0x	-0.817600	*	It's also not touching on the point that rich people can afford private healthcare whilst the NHS is being gutted and it's becoming near impossible to get GP appointments
t1_dub0ahm	0.571900	*	What is this some kind of Norwegian prison?
t1_dulsw7l	0.744100	*	Interesting. I was looking at some older data I guess. SA has gone down, Canada has gone *way* up from what I saw, and Venezuela and Mexico are exactly where they were.
t1_dusoxsi	0.000000	*	Any good sources on that I can read? I've always thought so, but never researched it. 
t1_du9yvzv	-0.680800	*	you must be special.
t1_dum2ha4	0.401900	*	Nah Strike Witches is specifically plane girls. I remember in the second season they fought alongside a group of battleships so definitely no shipgirls there.
t1_dusman4	-0.869200	*	Of all our miserable failures, I'd say the war on drugs is the biggest. It's accomplished virtually nothing noteworthy.
t1_dv0m5vr	0.000000	*	Depends how often you camp. 136.40 isn't bad when lots of campsites are $15 to $20 a night
t1_dusvhzi	0.000000	*	Why would a lizard want to join the Stormcloaks?  Uh, maybe because they were going to chop my head off for no reason? I'm also not down with wearing a red skirt.
t1_dul6gvz	0.241100	*	So a shitty, backwards country likes a shitty backwards leader? Color me shocked.
t1_duopabt	0.000000	*	Only for people who thinks like you.  I mean you people think it should be a crime to be stupid. 
t1_dugr8bc	0.700300	*	In some states the electoral college representative can vote for whoever they want.  They normally cast a vote for whoever won their state or district but it isn't mandatory
t1_duz9cdy	0.000000	*	internet wasn't really an invention its a collective thing. first gps was during the 70s
t1_dv2745y	0.250000	*	Funny, for all the talk about Mexico hurting the US all he has done as President is impose tariffs on Canada. 
t1_dujr2tp	-0.413700	*	So what you're saying is, we should be concerned about Russia. Ok.
t1_dup27ho	0.273200	*	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_oligarch  Scroll down to the Putin section.  For a more extensive read: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia_under_Vladimir_Putin  Hardly a conspiracy *theory*.
t1_dur82qf	0.000000	*	Your post history would say otherwise. Try being impartial if you're going to tell people it isn't a team sport.
t1_dv14cl7	0.440400	*	Your English is great though!
t1_duj84ow	-0.273200	*	So why do they entertain such mindless theater? I assume Russians are smart enough to know it's all a farce, yet the still participate?
t1_duupwrt	-0.636000	*	Or face Dothraki in an open field

t1_dv2qnft	0.000000	*	The quote.   The full quote.   Where he says to take guns away from mentally ill people.  Not from everybody.
t1_durlxen	0.000000	*	Yes its called actually living in America. Believe it or not opinions on the news and internet dont accurately portray a day/week/month/year in the life of someone who spends everyday on our soil.

t1_duw6dxb	0.000000	*	Ok please pass me the remote when you do
t1_dulss8u	-0.718400	*	Nobody ever considers that maybe Muslims are terrorists right now because muslim countries have been attacked. I grew up in the UK. All our terrorists used to be catholic. 
t1_dud7mqz	0.401900	*	It already sort of is. Just tell your physician that youre having trouble focusing and they can prescribe you a plethora of different meth and cocaine derivatives. 
t1_dutm1f8	0.000000	*	It is a fundamental right as it's a common military arm.
t1_dugxpj8	0.000000	*	Haha nice! Keep it up. 9 more to go! Do I get my split if I help you with a lil bit of bantering? Would I be considered 'colluding' with you? Is there bonus for that, too?
t1_dv01y5d	-0.680800	*	No joke. Literally everything in human nature that I don't like is SOCIALISM.  
t1_dv2oshb	0.000000	*	No, Hillary Clinton has been hated by independents for decades now. Stop trying to blame all of your problems on Russia, or else you will never be able to fix the real problems.
t1_dv02653	-0.077200	*	If you want to amend the constitution that's one thing. But as long as the 2nd amendment isn't repealed, most gun laws proposed cant be implemented constitutionally

t1_duizygf	0.000000	*	Yes fam :)
t1_duj28zc	0.361200	*	So San Francisco doesn't have enough money to build good public transport? How much of the USD$470B do they get to keep?
t1_dv1scvi	0.401900	*	This, of course, is absolute horseshit.
t1_durjom6	0.000000	*	Yes, if he can live with the knowledge that he is a dishonest thief and the people around him don't finally realize what he's done. I'm done with this pointless conversation. You can't hear me.

t1_duykoyi	-0.476700	*	I know I'm voting. Team blue all the way! Forever and ever. Tell the end of time. The GOP is unstable and borderline national security risk. 
t1_duu5q60	0.449700	*	Can you give me a link to this bill? Either in the Senate or the House? 
t1_dugxxrh	-0.701800	*	Ehh, it's pretty understandable *why* it's happening, just undeserved (to me)
t1_durfo49	0.000000	*	Did you watch the video?  I did. It was pretty grainy, I saw one clear hit at the end.
t1_duxw8j5	-0.350600	*	If the police are able to charge your property and take it without a law being broken, including millions of dollars in property, would you consider that shithole?
t1_durfr0j	-0.599400	*	Haha yeah, because when the US splits apart and civil war begins the mostly conservative military will stay loyal to a government murdering its own citizens haha
t1_dup81z1	0.358100	*	junky here. we buy points, qs (quarters/2.5grams),halfs and then into full grams and quarter ounces if you're buying a lot or low level dealing. 
t1_dudfcca	0.832800	*	It was more to create political division, but in the end, they wanted Trump to become president. This is very evident as you read through the charges.
t1_duzzx5c	-0.179300	*	Its like that in the States too. I've never actually seen anyone be shitty to a middle easterner. Too bad our governments cant get along.
t1_ducyuvn	-0.486400	*	You do want nukes though. Germany particiates in nuclear Sharing of it's own volition and every government for 60 years. Germany currently has 20 or so nukes at a base outside Cochem.
t1_duy7vi3	-0.732500	*	I'm not sure what soldiers in Iraq have to do with owning your own military-grade guns.
t1_dun15zm	0.318200	*	France is bacon.
t1_dut1l8l	-0.457400	*	Thank you, once The US is responsible for more than 60 millions deaths then we can start to compare. 
t1_dut5nlb	-0.457000	*	Patronising. This is why we ended the liberal elitist globalist Europhilic control of our country.

t1_dur90zy	0.000000	*	A printing press.
t1_dufjxbw	0.318200	*	No, it's just that what you said isn't really what'll happen if we believe Jews will just leave. You haven't stopped them. They just left to do it elsewhere.
t1_dub9act	-0.393900	*	There is a difference in taking time to go out and protest and the government actively entering your home to confiscate your property. If you can't tell the difference then this debate is done.
t1_duuvj1n	0.000000	*	Well....*you* cant....
t1_dui7h69	0.739400	*	Whatever they told you, man.
t1_duuk7gm	0.000000	*	The british left too. Why isn't Buenos Aires establishing a fishing colony claiming it as well? Are the british illegally staying on a French territory?
t1_dv2ius9	0.102700	*	Thanks in no small way to a Republican house and Senate that compromised every bill to death.

t1_dugv2g7	0.978000	*	If a company lobbies its way to a monopoly, how is that not breaking the system for profit?  Whatever youd like to call it, I mean it less specifically and more as the general desire for capital. 
t1_dusiiri	0.051600	*	I'm not sure how a corporation can have a religious belief, but here we are.
t1_dv3mt87	0.000000	*	Nope.   Canada does more trade with the USA than the USA does with Canada. Canada needs America. If Canada leaves, the USA will do just fine. It is just a fact. 
t1_duggdkf	0.000000	*	So you're basing your perception of all Americans on your experiences visiting American subs and floating the idea?
t1_dum1p7e	0.261200	*	But...if China is cracking down then they are illegal. 
t1_duunjhh	-0.038700	*	The fact that there are no term limits *combined* with the fact there is no way for the Chinese people to remove Xi from office, would make him a dictator. What do you think China is, a democracy?
t1_dud4ei4	0.860200	*	It's not that you're a conservative, it's that you drink from Don's sweat trough. 
t1_dud4n28	0.460100	*	It would be impressive if it weren't so scary to be living in it
t1_dv225ke	0.000000	*	There are around 150 Kfcs in Germany and more than 200 in France. Hopefully for me, there is none in Belgium.
t1_dupssco	0.000000	*	Nice! Please tell me it says BUCKLEUP BERTERCUP!
t1_dugp62q	0.419100	*	Even if that is the case, the whole appeal behind Bernie and in a way Trump is that 'politics as usual' is fucked up and not an excuse the public wants to accept anymore.
t1_dusi4k9	0.186800	*	So you're supporting not only an upheaval of the voting process but actually the whole Executive Branch?
t1_dumulvv	-0.273200	*	Maybe. I can't speak on how many of them are dog shit, but I know for me locally the University of San Francisco has that reputation. It's partly why they call it the University of Spoiled Foreigners.
t1_dug7pfx	-0.670500	*	But some edgy neckbeard virgin leeching off his 1st world government is telling you the real truth. You are just some highly educated guy who actually lives in Iraq what could you possibly know?
t1_dv4ttyx	0.102700	*	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-carrier  1.544 Mbit/s, it seems.

t1_dv0mjbh	0.493900	*	How do you win Hearts and minds by blocking traffic ?  I can understand using tactic as sort of threat. This is what we do if  you dont submit to our demands. but how it is winning hearts and minds ?
t1_duxg7bx	-0.128000	*	so in short: I don't comment on issues that people in other countries experience, despite the pain, suffering and injustice they feel, because they are not in my country.  See how silly that sounds?

t1_dusiq04	0.648600	*	I would argue it's elaborating on it rather than purely reiterating what he said, but you're welcome to be pedantic if you wish
t1_dv1redq	0.000000	*	I went door to door for the recall election.  :(  And again when Fiengold ran again.  Man sometimes Wisconsin makes me sad.

t1_dud2bgi	0.117900	*	Seattle, and the Pacific northwest in general, is the coffee hub of North America. There are more coffee shops and roasters there than pretty much anywhere in the world. 
t1_duqr2gc	0.981900	*	No one is asking you to give up your right. Raising the are wouldn't have stopped Las Vegas would it? Semi automatic rifles have no purpose in civilian life.

t1_dv2hiqd	-0.273200	*	I was pointing out that both sides are guilty of being shitty and not listening as a counter point to the guy I replied to who stated that it was mostly liberals. 
t1_duh7oul	0.440400	*	No, just almonds. 
t1_dud19g7	-0.898100	*	That's a fair point. I am by no means saying capitalism is a bad solution, it's the best we have.

t1_duom63q	0.000000	*	They are terrible. Jimmy Dore is OK, so no wonder he left them.
t1_dubru7m	0.440400	*	That's interesting. I remember being told it was against regulations to bury them in the compost heap. I wonder if there would be residual bacteria in that
t1_dudk38b	0.492400	*	Other guy did account for body mass, which basically covers that. An argument could be made that it isn't the only factor relating to childhood tho.  EDIT: I can't read. Ignore the first sentence.
t1_duqsmkb	0.440400	*	Seems you're not interested in actual conversation. All good.
t1_duf8tdq	-0.974800	*	It's the fucking title of the the sub... Politics implies multiple viewpoints, but all I see nowadays are anti-trump posts.

t1_dui39zi	0.694600	*	Thats just not true. I would never attack someome for not liking Trump. Never.   A joke. A bad joke. But a joke nonetheless. You are acting like he would really do it.

t1_duqbc7b	-0.718400	*	Yeah, those Vietcong really lost big time. Remember when we had overwhelming success against those Afghani goat farmers? Having weapons didn't help them protect themselves at all. 
t1_duarp2v	0.768400	*	the problem is humor styles don't necessarily translate across cultures  IASIP has a certain attitude about it that might just leave russians cold (well, colder than they already are)

t1_durfrj2	0.000000	*	I think it more of the fact that Japan straight out deny ever raping and killing 6 million people. The US do not deny their atrocities, but obviously no nation is going to  promote that shit.

t1_durcv8g	-0.440400	*	Yeah it's not my argument that's just what I've learned. The response to your comment would be that most of the military would be reluctant to fire upon civilians and would refuse.

t1_duuqaki	0.000000	*	That's about what they charge in the US. They are probably laundering money through the empty properties.

t1_dv5778p	-0.542300	*	You were the one moving the goal posts not me.  He used the term shit holes once.  You were the one that decided to widen that up to any time he criticizes any country.  
t1_duh1num	0.510600	*	 It's equivalent to pleading guilty and getting no punishment... in the federal case.  Which would make the state case a slam dunk

t1_dupqmaf	0.636900	*	Germany is pretty progressive but we lack in so many other aspects compared to our European neighbours. Our digital infrastructure is one of the worst in western Europe.  Its a shame.
t1_dutpaoq	0.000000	*	The interesting thing here is that you're calling me a Russian bot, but your punctuation indicates that you aren't even from the United States.

t1_duvwpin	-0.790600	*	I dunno, man, I think you're the only one here with the weird agenda, and it's not even for something that makes sense
t1_dubmmsv	0.936000	*	yeah no kidding... they dominate every post, every major news/political sub, and the front page then have the nerve to claim it's a right wing/conservative thing.

t1_dv3736l	-0.273200	*	This is what I'm thinking. It's probably very likely that by leaving said subreddit up it prevents the trolls from being scattered to the wind.

t1_dv03679	-0.823400	*	Yes exactly thats cool, these farmers don't deserve this at all.  I just would like it if people respected everyone suffering regardless of race. Antifa has pretty much died down, as they should.

t1_duicc07	-0.077200	*	Probably $500,000 and have it be a progressive tax and somehow make an exception for family farms because those people are land wealthy but nobody would claim that farmers are rich.

t1_duwpu21	0.608000	*	Why?  Does every company that sells to the EU require a presence there?  My company sells millions of dollars of product to the EU and we don't even have a main distribution hub there.
t1_duf58no	0.252500	*	I know the 10min timer is site-wide but no other sub abuses it as Politics does.   Shareblue owns that place and they make sure to silence any opposition.

t1_dv3acer	0.333600	*	What was your source, out of curiosity? I have a degree in IR and I wouldn't agree with that. I concede that they are both focussed on the importance of the state, but that's where it ends.

t1_dv42ojb	-0.129500	*	Really?  You're going to go that far into racism, as if the hinese are the only cause?  Really?
t1_dun6tea	0.000000	*	Just make sure that cafeteria shuts before midnight
t1_duttjp2	-0.476700	*	Almost all of it also based on flawed premises. The cost alone ignores what they are contributing to the economy.  The argument is just moving towards this.  A decade ago, it was about stealing jobs.
t1_dv1mvbj	-0.510600	*	at T_D they're saying this is another intentional part of his masterful long con.
t1_dujkdym	0.000000	*	Then leave NATO, right?
t1_dubm670	0.799800	*	Attacking EU and NATO territory would make the US lose all support from other countries. And the US can't invade mainland Europe if it's united against it.
t1_dv2g6so	0.000000	*	As I get older I see most countries suck. We just are under a bigger spotlight
t1_dut1so2	0.440400	*	Oh my, you think it was capitalism vs communism? LOL!
t1_dv050vb	0.000000	*	I'm sure if we... what's the word for it...? *think really hard* we can come up with the perfect name for it.
t1_duuklrm	-0.836000	*	Fire a few across the bow and send them back. You don't have to sink ships to enforce a blockade, per se. 
t1_dv3sldw	-0.458800	*	You mean the one who [DIDN'T want FPH banned](https://np.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3dautm/content_policy_update_ama_thursday_july_16th_1pm/ct3n7hc/)? 
t1_duv2bpm	0.000000	*	It's as if incentivizing imprisoning people is a bad thing.
t1_dudu74g	0.000000	*	And what powers does the Belgian goverment have to enforce that ruling?  If the company is outside of its legal reach there isn't much the Belgian goverment can do. 
t1_duy9tc7	0.130700	*	I did realize that but then I also realized that you are still a clown regardless so no harm done 
t1_duzxcuh	0.000000	*	> So according to you, Muslims have more in common with Western countries than white South Africans do?  There's a bunch of muslims in Western countries.
t1_dv2d79x	-0.912000	*	Now *that* is truly a battle between a giant douche and a turd sandwich.
t1_dunssb4	0.035600	*	A majority of countries in the world recognize Palestine as a state  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_recognition_of_the_State_of_Palestine
t1_dueylfc	0.000000	*	Not near as much. I use low doses, no insulin, no hgh, looking good.
t1_dua7xgk	-0.594000	*	>Those are going to be cold comfort when the economy collapses.  LMAO at this fear mongering shit. He already proved what a numpty people who say that are. Way to double down.
t1_duqgqaq	-0.296000	*	That's the Republican plan in a nutshell. Just keep getting worse candidates, and their predecessor will eventually look good.
t1_duzx2mj	0.619900	*	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_literacy_rate how disputable are they?   Wait so el Bloqueo was US and EU aid? Didn't the USSR primarily back Cuba?
t1_dut18zt	-0.493900	*	*  Everybody poops *
t1_dugx5el	0.000000	*	For something this huge, I would have a thought a large majority would have been needed. At least 65% - 70% majority.
t1_duywf4y	0.618400	*	You don't have an argument, you called creating life genocide, justify the claim otherwise you simply don't have an argument. 
t1_duaeu68	0.586800	*	Then why don't you give actual specifics. *How* do you claim people were unfairly influenced? Superdelegates are a poor argument that has nothing to do with Clinton.
t1_dugvrnx	0.000000	*	Jill Stein was and is a Russian tool. 
t1_dufd3mn	0.000000	*	No people will downvote you on politics if you have posted on the donald before, doesnt matter what your comment is, they look through your post history
t1_dv0uxlc	0.909900	*	>people can get their bloodlust fix    It's not Bloodlust, it's Human Nature. Morbid Curiosity.    Obviously some people are more extreme than others. 
t1_dunpcc1	0.585900	*	Yeah, that works. 'Begs' compiles but gives a nasty runtime exception when you do it on platforms that have native rhetoric support. 'Raises' is standards compliant and should work everywhere.
t1_dv0wmsn	0.238200	*	I do, but it's Wikipedia. Not the best source, but the best I can currently get you:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/School_shooting#Europe
t1_dugn66j	0.493900	*	Al Capone route?
t1_duuso7f	-0.680800	*	Thats a pretty bold statement to make about a country you're claiming will one day kill dissidents
t1_dv2vs5h	-0.226300	*	> It's almost as if guns are the easiest method to kill people and that leads to a higher murder rate, right?  Nope.
t1_duqp4pl	0.000000	*	Its just ironic when potheads vote for the party of Jeff Sessions thats been against legalization for decades.
t1_dunwsn0	0.440400	*	Don't take the bait mate 
t1_dui8lv1	0.137200	*	What? Do you think everyone who works in the city makes on average 75k?  I grew up in NYC, and even putting aside the minimum wage/no higher education population, that is not the case AT ALL.
t1_duqgiic	0.000000	*	You should google what the sons of Saddam did. Now that was fucked up.   
t1_dud0uzb	-0.648600	*	Literally a thread about Russian criminals   Why can't we talk about the victims in this article instead!!
t1_duq20nw	-0.393900	*	I don't see how they are different, considering the Dutch won their colonial lands by stealing them.
t1_dv384ov	0.000000	*	You literally have no idea how a different voting system would affect voting patterns. Some dems might not have voted, more repubs May have voted. You straight up dont know.
t1_duq4o7a	0.796400	*	that's fine!  thank you for being reasonable
t1_ducq9vc	0.000000	*	Well, you for starters.
t1_duuzqz7	0.401900	*	There are extensive and specific answers to your points. Debated by people way more educated on the subject. If you really are asking the answer is within your reach, don't be discouraged
t1_dudmlsn	-0.025800	*	Look up the Magnitsky Act
t1_duj5z9a	0.440400	*	And Vladimir collects ceramic unicorns
