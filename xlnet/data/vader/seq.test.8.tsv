t1_duo447u	0.585900	*	This made people disillusioned with Obama as well. We were fucking rampaging the middle east with drones like nobodies business during his admin and turned Libya into a failed state with our actions.

t1_dv39p92	-0.718400	*	I see that you have a poor opinion of nerds. That's okay. We've dealt with your harassment and snide comments all our lives.

t1_duxm9lh	-0.250000	*	I meant the past 50 years worldwide, not just in the Middle East. Islam isnt the issue though, evil people who use it to support themselves and suppress others are the real problem.
t1_dv2ln7a	-0.628000	*	I think his point was that because more people voted for Clinton than Trump she should be the president with the whole in a true democracy  comment.   Electoral college is stupid.

t1_duq6owj	0.796400	*	Russia is in dire straits economically. National pride is a big way that Putin keeps the populous from revolting. Winning medals at the Olympics is part of building up that national pride.
t1_dup3rqc	0.888500	*	I would like to see your reaction if Putin shows up at a right wing demo in the USA and says he supports their cause.
t1_duxl4mb	-0.898500	*	You don't realize the irony of claiming choice but the symbol you use is an item that has shamed and oppressed women for centuries?

t1_duzy49w	0.119500	*	Im not sure why that would stop anyone outside the US from investing in Cuba... also, the trade from an entire country would more than economically justify a few dedicated boats for that purpose.
t1_dubonhk	0.544800	*	> there are few things less moral than being a billionaire  How so? What about people who make their money through honest means without harming anybody (or are you saying this is impossible)?

t1_dugcgbe	-0.670500	*	I made my decision, I didn't like Hillary so I had to pick the most likely candidate to beat her. 
t1_dupv3z6	0.709600	*	No it wasn't, but you're clearly a brick wall so idk why I'm even typing this.

t1_duovmmx	-0.421500	*	Do you do this becuase you don't have IRL friends? At least this way you can feel like you're part of a group of like-minded people.
t1_dv2n3rp	-0.929100	*	I saw this defense coming. But something trusted was appropriated and used to decieve. Don't victim shame. 
t1_due58xd	0.000000	*	You do realize that russian bots also spouted left-leaning shit too right? Journalist Tim Pool proved that and the media pretty much told him to fuck off.
t1_dup09h4	-0.790200	*	Im taking about people who make up apologetics for those who commit fascist acts regardless of ideology.
t1_ducr8fb	0.000000	*	Uh. Wut?
t1_dv35fln	0.000000	*	I feel like /r/technology has gone the same way lately. I subbed to see cool new tech, but it feels like it's going more and more political, and there is *a lot* of altrighter stuff on there. 
t1_dv020nh	-0.868400	*	When did I suggest a redline? 
t1_duj60je	-0.175900	*	If Canada was smart they would build a wall now.

t1_dus97ei	-0.585900	*	Germany was forced to pay compensation. If a french farmer lost x sheep, and other assets. After the war they could go to the french government, and the bill was passed onto the German Government.

t1_dv0183t	0.000000	*	Not the dictionary definition. And gene + cide doesn't leave a lot to interpretation. 
t1_duhxq90	0.476700	*	EU didn't abolish borders. There are rules regarding freedom of movement - its just that the UK govt never bothered to implement them.
t1_dudamfi	-0.409800	*	Sure they were. An extremely simple value everyone should share. They didn't want a crook in the Whitehouse.
t1_dupcpt8	-0.734800	*	Manafort eventually resigned after the Ukrainian Ledger was found etc. but that , Trump asking Russia for the hacked emails and 40 other things did not receive the coverage it should have.
t1_duy97vk	0.802000	*	You can't even compare your theif scenario with wearing makeup to work. What a headache that was. 
t1_duyne9y	0.790300	*	The whole point is that both were bad choices. America was asked to choose between two evils. A choice without actual choice.
t1_dusnv4p	0.000000	*	And it sounds close to testes 
t1_duibeue	0.938400	*	Sorry, but this is obvious.  Do i have to google for you?
t1_dumx946	-0.942800	*	For a number of reasons. One of which is Russia's massive disinformation campaign against the American people.

t1_dufni25	0.895100	*	I thought it said there was none in the world. I remember seeing a BBC article on it and I cant imagine why the BBC would write an article on it if it was only for the States
t1_duxqex3	0.000000	*	So he would than be a terrorist, a bomber, a neo-nazi... and a really good shooter? That... seems scarier to me, honestly. 
t1_dur9d6m	-0.986700	*	> Terrorists attack civilian targets.  So, America? 
t1_dun0ggi	0.056700	*	Man, this person has been entirely respectful and even went out of their way to say that they're coming back later to give a meaningful response. You don't gotta be like that.
t1_dv2k6im	0.964100	*	The vast majority of us who voted for Bernie voted for Hillary. Moscow Jill is another matter.

t1_duhw3wh	0.000000	*	I think the point is that they aren't likely just hanging out in the streets.  They may be searching, but have a spouse who is supporting them.
t1_dus1ba7	0.000000	*	But they would know if the warrent couldnt be renewed, which is what you are bitching about. 
t1_dut93j1	0.744400	*	What does China stand to gain? It would cause chaos in world markets. It's far more likely that the US invades Canada than China Taiwan.

t1_dv5t1lc	0.226300	*	I should go back using swype...   Still would like to know where the US is tighter with its regulations in comparison to Germany.   (I had to correct 4 words 6 times writing this comment.)

t1_duxcipe	-0.890500	*	And there are war criminals buried at Arlington Cemetery.  What's your point?
t1_duzwz33	0.000000	*	I would think sending in spies or a special team to check - or at least some damn satellite photos to attempt to verify - would be a pre-requisite.

t1_duvu31z	0.000000	*	Plus, a large amount of that comes from the western world offshoring its production to China. 
t1_durhim3	0.273200	*	Well, your government does. And they represent you know. So, if you wanna change that, you gotta do something about the white trash supremacy tapeworm you've got as your president currently.

t1_dui92jl	0.000000	*	maybe don't have 4 kids then.

t1_duyfxxh	0.000000	*	I can tell you that the EU is seen as moribund, slow moving, and insular from other parts of the world. Old news from the old world.
t1_dug7b81	0.000000	*	There we are. You're a terrible person defense :)
t1_duuirby	-0.972400	*	They just haven't fully realized their potential yet.  Wait until [Jean-Christophe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Christophe,_Prince_Napol%C3%A9on) rises to power.
t1_durb39j	-0.872400	*	Yes? You seem to be missing that if gun were banned this wouldn't happen in the first place. You don't get this shit in the UK or Australia. Inb4 hurr durr we could never do that here.
t1_dubvdpt	0.734300	*	They are exaggerations from someone who clearly has an anti-china agenda. There are plenty of shit to criticize China for, the extra spin is unnecessary.
t1_duqcvff	-0.340000	*	He asked for a source, I gave him a source. I wasn't making any argument. 
t1_duqt0tt	-0.458800	*	yeah thats why the founders took on the separation of powers idea- you can have a centrally run government if various branches are independent and monitor each other 
t1_dui71fd	0.224700	*	Sounds like this isn't my fault yet it's sort of like I have to pay for it.
t1_duyx1iw	0.950500	*	You use an ad hominem attack against me and talk of logic in the same sentence. It would be funny if it weren't so sad you don't even know what you are doing. 
t1_dv1p99b	-0.401900	*	A bit different in this case. This is simply fair play.
t1_dui8fib	0.000000	*	No it's not, you're just 6600x lazier than he is! Pull yourself by the bootstraps and stop buying avocado toast
t1_duia9fu	0.748800	*	Well it's not like Gates could have lived off daddy's money his whole life
t1_ducfoqf	0.000000	*	Considering what I just said is a verifiable fact, I think I will.  What's your excuse for your behavior?
t1_duzzzv1	0.000000	*	Yes. I hate the true natives argument. Of course lets talk about the dark shit we have done. But dont ostracize groups just because their ancestors did that shit ages ago.  
t1_dugc0po	0.000000	*	Unless it's universal healthcare or gun control, than we don't want to have their higher standards of health and safety.

t1_dv1psjg	0.000000	*	Wisconsonite checking in... we try, we really TRY to vote out these idiots, but sometimes it falls apart. The Scott Walker fiasco was a huge money-waste in the end.
t1_dv1te9g	0.000000	*	The capacity to have a civilized discussion.
t1_dv1fj5w	-0.849900	*	Public opinion is irrelevant. Im sorry but if the general public is wrong about a topic, this means we dont listen to general consensus not the other way around. 
t1_duq9bej	0.000000	*	Well, he was previously imprisoned for sex crimes. I'd deem him unchangeable. He should be in prison for the rest of his life.
t1_dv3n3xu	-0.763700	*	Welfare programs aren't just giving free stuff, that's a pretty right-wing position. 
t1_dumj3tu	-0.177900	*	Rush Limbaugh's been calling people libtards since the early 2000's, so that's nothing new. Snowflake is more recent in a political sense, but doesn't seem that bad to me.
t1_dusq2ex	0.670500	*	Ask them to follow the law and be here legally 
t1_dv3ccdb	0.745600	*	the only problem i have with that system is i only commented once on T_D calling them dipshits and i got banned from all the subs that ban T_D users

t1_duywopo	-0.305700	*	Lincoln ? total failure. The best presidents are the ones that dont get assasinated.  
t1_duvydat	0.000000	*	He lost me after he said humans will be facing extinction in 40 years. C'mon dude. On a geological timescale that's basically a few hours from now.

t1_dugd26o	0.364100	*	I get the feeling this dude would have been one of [these people](https://greensborositins.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/sit-ins1963.gif).

t1_duz27fu	-0.784500	*	Parody is covered under fair use considering this is a parody of the stock image meme even if they reposted an exact copy it would be fine. 
t1_dv25vg0	0.856200	*	None of anyone thats a contender at the moment.   And Hilliard definitely got preferential donation and dnc ad treatment.  
t1_duzydc2	0.000000	*	According to Wikipedia whites only take up about 8% of the population. So I doubt a civil war will last long of it ever happens

t1_dulzn1k	0.000000	*	Yeah, but they threw four touchdowns in one game!
t1_dugc6pv	-0.476700	*	Oh man, I've got bad news for you. That's been the modus operandi of the American government for many years now and I don't think it will change any time soon. 
t1_dv37hs9	-0.542300	*	Or that her campaign was basically its my turn and I have a Vagina vote for me. 
t1_dut4w3c	0.502300	*	Thanks. Will try my utmost. Just curious, is there any compulsory course for a second language during pre-college i.e. K-12 phase education in USA?
t1_duracpc	-0.451600	*	And remember, your country isn't free if you democratically elect a leader who doesn't bow to American corporations' interests
t1_dum6uj8	0.000000	*	That's a stupid idea for America, but it would probably be a really good idea for Nigerian teachers in areas threatened by Boko Haram.

t1_duw9u6z	0.000000	*	A real american lets kids get massacred in a school and waits outside lmfao
t1_duc7elq	-0.970500	*	He was complicated. On one hand, he stood up against the greatest evil of his time. On the other, he had some pretty flawed opinions and fucked ideas himself.
t1_dv3mard	0.128000	*	When did they become a jewish democratic state?  The previous government collapsed because Likud wanted to officially make Israel a Jewish state and the rest of their coalition government didn't.

t1_durcfbu	-0.817600	*	Right I'm talking about the statement of vaccines being a large portion of their GDP not the fact that gates gave them money 
t1_dv1pv4s	0.421500	*	They want experienced people for non-experienced pay, and then they want to treat you like an expense instead of an asset.

t1_duz8360	0.000000	*	We're also only voting on polarized topics. There's never a middle ground or compromise for Voters.  We basically only ever get to vote on Ultimatums: Either you vote yes or no.

t1_duwor86	0.296000	*	Well, he was right about you being salty, if this overreaction of yours is any indication.
t1_duibw6c	-0.226300	*	It's funny because we, as a society, decide how much Microsoft is worth, and consequently how much he is worth. He earns exactly how much, we deem is fair for the value of his work.
t1_duxh65j	0.634100	*	Look at us making things up on the fly, but we say it confidently, so it's probably true.

t1_duyszcu	-0.964500	*	Britain colonised South Africa to steal its mineral wealth. There's a history lesson for you. And since it was blatantly stolen from Africans without consent then it should be returned.

t1_ducxt2u	0.318200	*	I didn't like what the DNC did with Sanders, so I voted for Stein in the general. Not that I wanted Trump to win, I honestly didn't think he had a chance.  I'm from Michigan; that shit mattered. 
t1_due9gvk	0.921700	*	TBH his supporters right now are probably thinking Thanks for the help, Russians!  A lot of them have the mindset that any path to a victory is a good path.

t1_dui7khn	-0.102700	*	So you saved apprenticeship salary for like 4 years an then bought a house and car with it...? Either you make insane money or you must have bought a really cheap house.
t1_dv1b5wz	0.381800	*	Freedom of speech implies that you are free to say whatever you want, not that you will not ever face repercussions for what you decide to say. 
t1_duev2p3	0.754300	*	Ahh ok got it. I sure hope we can maintain the balance and see the industry as exploration and expansion rather than an escape.

t1_dugat3g	0.427100	*	There is and could have been a far darker timeline. Some idiot in office giving everyone a laugh and wasting time is better than putting all that time into war and sabotage.
t1_durb39j	0.812200	*	Yes? You seem to be missing that if gun were banned this wouldn't happen in the first place. You don't get this shit in the UK or Australia. Inb4 hurr durr we could never do that here.
t1_duegm2z	-0.307600	*	I would have gotten my ass kicked.
t1_dua8ext	0.273200	*	So mars then
t1_duqu6i6	0.670500	*	At this point it really depends on how valuable the person you're selling out is.
t1_dudpuxy	0.742400	*	I'm with you, man. Hoping California just napalms the system and goes single payer soon. That'll be the beginning of the change, most likely.
t1_duegryt	0.000000	*	What a buncha fucks. Poor couple.  What the fuck can you do in that instance? Aside from pulling an imaginary gun  on them and getting her the fuck outa there
t1_dubrot9	0.000000	*	Cant trust anyone these days. 
t1_dur57ks	-0.309100	*	Your account is three days old. Are you a Soros trollbot made for anti-gun propaganda?
t1_duprtwl	0.096100	*	Yeah, I'm not sure where that's coming from. Olympic hockey is huge and Bettman caused massive issues in the league by not taking the two week break. 
t1_dudrlv1	0.592700	*	If its a specific formulation, you probably can.
t1_dukmc5b	0.731900	*	Or maybe he just appointed a money man to lead and audit the Agency because he felt they spent an exorbitant amount of money in the prior administration. To streamline the EPA per say. 
t1_duxwtss	0.000000	*	It's almost as if guns are only part of the problem in the US and we need to address other issues as well and nobody in support of gun control has ever suggested otherwise.
t1_dupq5bi	0.509300	*	Angels advocate, thank you for this 
t1_dud2ykx	-0.648600	*	Lowering its budget and moving people around isnt really dismantling the state department. 
t1_dub0n4v	-0.636900	*	As someone who's moved here 12 years ago, that guy is full of shit. It's like 'as a black guy' or 'as a woman' etc, usually followed by something opinionated and non factual.
t1_dv3qyui	0.000000	*	God forbid that people actually use the voting system provided to them by Reddit right?
t1_dv062qm	-0.778300	*	I literally said it may not be fair, read please.
t1_dv1peci	0.202300	*	Yea pretty much the exact same thing Hitler did. Kinda scary when you look at the parallels between them. 
t1_duz4bmw	0.000000	*	Let's mess things up for them then, figure out a system to get US, Canadian and Norwegian oil to replace Russian oil in Germany and Eastern Europe, that'll deal some damage 
t1_dulezv8	-0.817600	*	Thanks for saying this.  It's a prime example of how little ppl know about the actual laws.  No one can legally buy a gun without a background check under current law.
t1_duphag8	0.763600	*	Schade! Liegen?
t1_dup2lvi	-0.380600	*	I'm going to casually bring up this bit of trivia in conversation so people think I'm street. 
t1_dujajqg	0.000000	*	It worked for a long time. It's not Atatxfcrks fault that nearly 70 years later the turks elected some idiots?
t1_dugkpcn	0.000000	*	Im pretty sure the Republicans were the ones who sold out our country to the Russians.  I think we have a right to be pretty damn pissed.  
t1_dugd0m9	-0.969800	*	It's super bad, where everyone does it.   What makes you think otherwise?
t1_dv0d2n2	0.000000	*	i'm sorry but Venezuela's economy isn't 70% privatized, all major industries and businesses are state owned some of them were expropriated or seized, others like pdvsa were nationalized in the 70's 
t1_dv2lhsl	-0.865500	*	At the very least we would have had some sense of normalcy with Clinton, I'd rather have had her than an actual blithering idiot. 
t1_dur705w	0.000000	*	-----> the point   ------> your head
t1_dv2kmnf	0.214500	*	Agreed completely.  And I don't think NPR, Twitter users, nor Reddit users for the majority are even aware they're being used and preyed upon by domestic actors with the same methods. 
t1_dugkbbb	0.000000	*	Bernie was an independent his whole life, he couldn't expect the DNC to equally favor him. If he wanted more establishment support he should have paid his dues. 
t1_duzzlqw	0.226300	*	I'm donating chrome spraypaint to needy South African farmers, so, hopefully everything will be OK on that front at least.
t1_dui2inx	0.000000	*	Why are we talking past tense here?
t1_dui94ln	0.000000	*	Deduct 30 from 90 and you get 60. Deduct 30 from 30 and you get 0.  If rich people really hadn't felt the effect they wouldn't have bothered lobbying to get it lowered.
t1_duy7l0m	-0.919400	*	Where was the right to own slave in the constitution? 
t1_dv0g1gk	0.000000	*	No two drugs could be more different.

t1_dux4jtm	0.319200	*	I bought a new petrol car, because I like and prefer it over electric.
t1_dv20ehs	-0.296000	*	To clear this up a bit, I wasn't trying to say opposing pedophilia was elitist but that the snide comment about Alabama was.
t1_dunj2fq	0.000000	*	The dolphin incident isn't Japan spread its a small area in the south that do it. The government has banned it but the problem is the local government not stoping it 
t1_dv39n7y	0.000000	*	I don't recall the scene with trump shtuping little old ladies.
t1_duootjp	0.368700	*	supposedly around 10-15 years ago the Trump Family was unable to get money from western banks (due to all the bankruptcies) so that's why they had to turn to the Russians. 
t1_dv0texv	0.000000	*	Albit Einstein.
t1_dupacrn	0.000000	*	Lol thanks for the advice, I'll pass it on.
t1_duq6wgc	0.000000	*	Did you even care to read the article?
t1_duj7pfd	0.000000	*	exactly what quality of life do you think the average russian peasant had under peter or catherine?
t1_duw2bqo	0.486000	*	so why are you answering scientific questions then on reddit if you don't know how it works?  for fucks sake.the only thing you are doing is spreading bad information. don't do that.
t1_dv2d4rg	-0.599400	*	That's the responsibility of the parents. Who let's their 10-year-old on twitter?  Also, twitter has NSFW filters for sensitive material if I'm not mistaken.
t1_duz7gpt	0.000000	*	Your comment isn't fair, because China spends far less than we do on military junk.
t1_dudy2pt	0.752300	*	It IS highly regulated. You're looking for a simple solution to one of the most complicated issues of our time
t1_duqbh2p	-0.051600	*	I'm not even pissed at bush 2 anymore as my anger has been dyson'd by this current group.
t1_dudupcy	0.123600	*	You have no idea. Look at all the brand name products people buy that are literally the same as the off brand stuff. Advertising works, that's why they do it.
t1_dufcbau	0.361200	*	interesting, so in the XVI century there was an spain inhabited by spaniards who spoke spanish right?   
t1_dugdw1k	0.000000	*	Wed probably be at war with Russia with Hillary. Were probably getting into WW3 with Trump. Either way we would be fucked.
t1_duzjrdn	0.401900	*	Isn't Belarus, for the most part, what is left of the old Soviet Union? I mean, they never changed the name of the security service there (it's still KGB).
t1_dv00ucf	0.000000	*	Racists are the source of racism, like you right now.
t1_duqrkqk	0.542300	*	I mean, do we really need conspiracy theories when the Republicans are literally pleading guilty to the felony of conspiracy against the United States?
t1_duud5bn	0.000000	*	Police monitor social media here too, mainly to prevent people linking terrorism with Islam, to prevent people naming and shaming paedophiles or to prosecute those that teach their dogs Nazi gestures.
t1_duy1o5g	0.540200	*	Having your grandfather being close to literally Hitler would make most people unelectable in the West, even if you said his actions were terrible. Which is not something Abe is doing.
t1_duulu9c	0.000000	*	Who brought the topic up and is acing all butthurt because my government is mean to you?
t1_dv03u4a	-0.929200	*	How many American citizens live in South Korea and Okinawa?  Also, Fuck everyone that isn't me is not productive when you are part of a community.
t1_duj6uyo	0.458800	*	> You have no idea what I know or don't. Educate yourself.  Gladly, where can we sign up for the Just how stupid is u/DeucesCracked? course?
t1_dufnx2v	0.000000	*	If you think citizens from a non-native ethnicity shouldn't have the same rights as natives, your opinion would still be racist, irrespective of which part of the world your opinion applies to. 
t1_duqoarb	0.000000	*	They know.
t1_dv394ra	0.599400	*	So what you're saying is I'm a trailblazer? Like Rosa Parks?
t1_dudupcy	-0.526700	*	You have no idea. Look at all the brand name products people buy that are literally the same as the off brand stuff. Advertising works, that's why they do it.
t1_dugihjb	-0.458800	*	You are right, Israel should take in more refugees just like European/Western countries. 
t1_dulpuuq	-0.599400	*	Death squads entirely composed of corgis.
t1_dut5nc6	0.000000	*	Don't think I've ever seen or talked with a Khergit on the Internet, so just wanna say *its almost harvesting season*.

t1_dudu3fh	0.853700	*	If it wasn't for the Xarelto commercials, my dad would have ended up on Coumadin after his stroke   He much prefers the Xarelto 
t1_durhh1y	-0.286500	*	Cool, so let's just do nothing then. You see the problem with that?  Better 5% of those supplies reach citizens than 0%.
t1_ducxnwf	0.799700	*	These aren't oligarch's, they are pawns. I can imagine China choosing to extradite if the circumstances benefitted them sufficiently.
t1_dux5wj8	-0.525600	*	WTF, alcohol does the most harm to users and to others than the rest of them. If you spend 30 seconds of your time you can find tons of articles and studies proving this is true.
t1_duk9x8o	0.000000	*	What country has free health care and free college?
t1_duyfvh2	0.000000	*	People in the military and police also revolt just like every other revolution ever? 
t1_dv14hba	-0.906200	*	We'd better erase all of the Nazi propaganda from the history books too, or else someone's feelings might get hurt.
t1_duzz0gs	-0.457400	*	I think there were two Boer wars, maybe three.  Churchill I think was only present for the final one, so you're getting just a piece of the puzzle. 
t1_durgrnj	-0.948500	*	And Germany murdered 30+ million.   What is the point you're trying to make?
t1_dusni0x	-0.275500	*	You wanted to be all rebellious and independent.
t1_duuf62u	0.025800	*	T_D and reddit users belong to the most irrelevant voter age demographic. What matters is middle-aged and old people watching mainstream media (though msm sometimes pick up pieces from reddit etc)
t1_dufpfjx	-0.273200	*	Maybe so but the only aircraft I fly are commercial like the other 99% of the populace.
t1_durm3cl	-0.908100	*	There is a huge difference between the 18th and one of the original of the bill of rights. 1 through 5 will never be repeled with out a war breaking out.
t1_dubwzsh	-0.535600	*	Your kids are far more likely to die on the road there, and your irrational fears have no bearing on other people's rights.
t1_ducgj0l	0.361200	*	Good question. 
t1_dusjoxa	0.000000	*	Tbh you sound like a middle class white person who wants minorities to feel empathy for the people who hate us. Nahhhhh. 
t1_dubhdv7	0.296000	*	I mean Russian history begins with them petitioning a viking to come and rule them. 
t1_dv02j55	0.624900	*	I mean, at the rate they were at when europeans came, it wasnt looking too fresco  but also consider that european reports may have been biased in making them seem worse to justify shit 
t1_ducx7ja	0.803700	*	That is the definition dovetc is using, too. The US govt can't arrest people living in Russia, and Russia won't extradite them.
t1_dv4txkt	-0.002600	*	No I'm talking about a missile, https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersonic_Low_Altitude_Missile

t1_dv2ho2t	-0.401900	*	Nope. You watch too much MSM, homie. Is Wales full of sheep fuckers that dont actually speak English?
t1_dud5ah8	0.651300	*	Indeed and also funded by the Hillary Clinton campaign.  Clearly Russian Collusion according to your standards.
t1_duiddi0	0.018600	*	That's a pretty vapid argument. 2/3 don't get circumcised. 
t1_dugvq0m	0.000000	*	Trump is innocent and there is currently a witch hunt against him from the Deep state 
t1_dugs7f9	0.799600	*	No one here is disputing the election win. Wrong thread

t1_dukahas	-0.177900	*	You're either a troll, a bot, or aren't following the conversation very much. No one was talking about party platform in this thread
t1_duxrdac	-0.476700	*	Yes, they did. Both did. Next.
t1_dusna51	0.514500	*	Not unless you think that George W Bush betrayed America as well.
t1_dv28bwl	0.411800	*	Thing is, life isn't fallout. People don't survive radiation and become ghouls who live forever. Instead they just die, all of them.
t1_dv0keds	0.458500	*	well regarding the womens equality, I think Korea is behind the west. Social pressure is enorm esecially for women, which is a reason for the flourishing plastic surgery business
t1_dv4q35w	0.043600	*	A lot of cognitive dissonance among the wizarding community, apparently.
t1_dusncz6	0.000000	*	You make it sound like rich people having more input is just. 
t1_dv375o1	0.585900	*	Interesting workaround but it's never been tested in court.  It's possible the government could order a company to leave their warrant canary up, even if they are under investigation.
t1_dux0caf	0.593000	*	Your very first link proves you wrong.     Also, Cristopher Hitchens was a funtioning alcoholic. Find me a functioning crackhead. 
t1_duewosu	-0.750000	*	American food is just English food with extra oil and orange cheese.
t1_dupoiap	0.000000	*	For most places that is absolutely true, but there are some itchy bottlenecks that are a result of lacking long term thinking

t1_duyufkj	0.624900	*	Yeah, when guns can actually do damage to the government.  Today you kind of need nukes to do that. I reckon everyone should possess their own nukes. What do you think?
t1_dujlic6	-0.476700	*	You're assuming they feel they are lying. They don't. She thinks what she says is truth, damn the evidence.   Don't have sympathy for these evil people. Don't give them an out. 
t1_dugryja	0.000000	*	Do you mean, why is my vote valued at the exact same as everybody else's?
t1_dugg3al	-0.090000	*	Trump isn't going to be the last American president ever. This kind of absolute contempt for our nation is going to last long after Trump is out of office.  I know I'm not going to forget about it.
t1_dv01tw8	-0.102700	*	But thats like saying it is acceptable to think Canadians and Americans sound the same. 
t1_dueq9jh	0.680800	*	Dictators don't really bother me, democracy isn't a one size fits all depending on the culture.

t1_duyj91g	0.453400	*	Verified accounts are commonly  managed by people other than the verified individual. Not saying that trump didn't send that tweet though.

t1_dv399ys	0.000000	*	If you're going to slap a label on someone, it's best for that someone to make the label work on their terms. Self-identification is tongue in cheek at this point.

t1_duzy49w	0.000000	*	Im not sure why that would stop anyone outside the US from investing in Cuba... also, the trade from an entire country would more than economically justify a few dedicated boats for that purpose.
t1_duwu0i7	-0.955900	*	True.  I was being too absolute. But you have to admit, nurses get the brunt.  Especially on the floors where the doctors interact less with the patients.
t1_dubvdn2	-0.757900	*	Have you ever talked to an enlisted servicemember?  There is so much hurry up and wait its actually incredible.
t1_duimki5	0.002800	*	Has importing millions of low wage workers helped?

t1_duja3q4	0.891800	*	I speak to lots of Russian people and they all say gay people have much better time in Russia than the US. Stop with your propaganda and speak to real Russian.

t1_dusj5gk	-0.852900	*	Sounds like something they would do... People on here are so cliche... No, that's not even close to reality. Do you really think they're sitting around and thinking let's tax the poor?
t1_duqhm1z	0.681800	*	It's about appearance. Her race, in this case, affects her appearance. I'm sure I've gone over all this in previous posts.
t1_dv0owue	0.432900	*	This argument really isn't helpful any longer. The accepted meaning of GMO is a transgenic organism.
t1_due4yaj	-0.690800	*	Read the Ten Commandments. Read what Jesus did.  You are equalizing what a few corrupt and perverted bastards do to what an entire religion believes in.

t1_duyszcu	0.273200	*	Britain colonised South Africa to steal its mineral wealth. There's a history lesson for you. And since it was blatantly stolen from Africans without consent then it should be returned.

t1_dv1psjg	-0.718400	*	Wisconsonite checking in... we try, we really TRY to vote out these idiots, but sometimes it falls apart. The Scott Walker fiasco was a huge money-waste in the end.

t1_ducosqw	0.241100	*	ISIS took credit for the Vegas shooting.  The FBI said there was no link.  By your shitty /r/politics-grade logic, it doesn't matter, it was clearly an ISIS attack.
t1_ducb4s0	0.571900	*	So if that's true, the anti gun activists should settle down, because the constitution is the constitution, and guns are not being taken away anytime soon.

t1_dudtss5	0.000000	*	You got a bad batch man, I dunno.  I know plenty and they all tip the standard 20% and expense it.  There's no reason for them not to tip, everything is comped by the company.

t1_dubnj90	0.000000	*	How so? 
t1_duufh02	-0.586200	*	Thats your opinion. Personally I think its depraved to think that the alternatives - full on invasion of the Japanese islands, or starvation through prolonged blockade, were preferable.
t1_duukkji	0.000000	*	How is that helping Russia though?   China can actually wreck havoc on the world economy.

t1_dv0m0u8	-0.218700	*	First, if you can't explain, you can just say no.   Second, You don't have real freedom of speech, and if you're defending this then you clearly don't understand why free speech is important.
t1_dv02m8p	0.000000	*	The fact that you think conquest = colonialism shows how little you know of the matter.  Reductionist as fuck.

t1_duym7zu	0.000000	*	Aww shit. *Starts purging computer with a hammer*
t1_duovr6k	-0.258400	*	Yes it is. This actress is playing Joan of Arc, an actual historical figure. Abraham Lincoln the vampire slayer is not a historical figure.

t1_duo7ism	-0.296000	*	If it's a play, it should be accurate. Otherwise, it's not really Joan of Arc. As for the attendees, yes, no one cares because it's just people dressing up in renaissance attire. 
t1_duzzeb3	0.746900	*	Was referring to history but I get what you are saying. Modern civilisation might brake the pattern. I really hope so.

t1_duaay9z	0.000000	*	Some of us are pretty pro-capitalist, left leaning and huge supporters of mass migration.  In fact I generally feel countries that dont support immigration are doing themselves a major disservice.

t1_dv03dh4	0.000000	*	Why not just use the word thing for everything?   Some things thinged some things. That should cover it.   The fact that you could be more general doesn't mean that being specific isn't a problem.
t1_dv2z2tc	0.000000	*	> He said that if Trump won those states, he would win the election  That's not a hard thing to predict. Anyone with basic math ability can work out electoral vote totals.
t1_duymxz6	0.434400	*	I haven't heard anything about Russians encouraging the Stein vote. Is that being investigated too or did that already come out?
t1_dv0os33	0.000000	*	Well said; I have nothing but respect for the Russian people.

t1_duhjrs0	0.000000	*	Americans aren't anywhere near as patriotic or nationalist as you seem to think.  I imagine that's just how we're often portrayed in media.
t1_durg89f	0.000000	*	To be fair, you can make statistics say anything.  From my experience, women in Australia dont even bother to report when they get punched in the jaw, it happens so much and nothing is done.   
t1_dunpmq1	0.051600	*	Sandy hook guy having his mothers gun is illegal. Unless she gave it to him I would consider it stealing it. Especially since he used her gun to kill her with it.

t1_duht0hm	0.944200	*	Medicare + Medicaid + VA covers approximately 1/3 of the population. We need to roll these three programs into one, and expand it to everyone, using the economies of scale to keep costs down.

t1_dv27h4v	-0.250100	*	Shouldn't we consider factors besides what's cheapest? Like working conditions for the people in these foreign industries? 
t1_duqpzz0	0.944900	*	So did I but I dug a bit deeper and he can offer pardons at the federal levels but they do not override state convictions. 
t1_dug2j85	0.401900	*	Reading comprehension

t1_dv49zqz	-0.893000	*	Why are games these days so massive? Do they just not really bother with compression now that it's all digital instead of needing to fit it onto discs.
t1_duj1h5h	0.780400	*	Funny thing, he is Putin's favorite artist.  Coincidence? or just training for you?
t1_dubjsme	0.115400	*	By your definition every religion on earth is a cult? 
t1_dur2b27	0.226300	*	most of those people make a lot of money though. The household income is probably well over $100k
t1_dui1quu	0.421500	*	It's funny how we're both going through a similar phase again at the same time. Reagan/Maggie then and Trump/Brexit now. I guess your Trump would be Boris or something.

t1_dunzwqf	-0.623900	*	And my apologies, I really thought you were spreading 'fake news'. I guess it was papers themselves jumping to conclusions without waiting for the law enforcement to finalize their investigation.

t1_duxdico	0.000000	*	The point of it was to be silly.  It was using a far too small sample to make a crazy conclusion.  Like concluding a local weather event has predictive power of the world's climate.

t1_dv35fln	0.000000	*	I feel like /r/technology has gone the same way lately. I subbed to see cool new tech, but it feels like it's going more and more political, and there is *a lot* of altrighter stuff on there.

t1_duuzsyj	-0.510600	*	The question is whether a functional addict should still be considered an addict.  And, in my thinking, a venn diagram says yes.

t1_dupq94e	0.822500	*	back 1940 maybe, police in 95% of german cities that dont have an immigration crisis like duisburg marlox or some parts of berlin dont even carry a gun, from my experience they are not brutal at all

t1_dv375o1	0.102700	*	Interesting workaround but it's never been tested in court.  It's possible the government could order a company to leave their warrant canary up, even if they are under investigation.

t1_dum1g2c	0.827500	*	Are you suggesting things in HK are good or bad?   I was in HK a few weeks ago.   HK is basically part of China now.

t1_dur6rb2	0.942600	*	The price of valuing truth is refusing to let other people think for you in exchange for their false camaraderie. In short, the price is happiness for those who value social belonging.

t1_dugq23t	-0.942800	*	And that's a terrible way to force minority representation into a first past the post system. Proportional representation is a better solution to this problem in all respects

t1_duah54u	-0.807400	*	I would argue that SCOTUS is the only reason Trump *was* elected. Millions of Republicans held their nose and voted for Trump because it meant that they got to keep the SCOTUS.

t1_duq972n	0.102700	*	Claiming that Western Europe is currently in chaos is going more than a bit far. The US has political and social problems, and the UK is a joke politics-wise, but the rest is far from 'chaos'.

t1_dv0u3zh	0.000000	*	I would disagree, people get stuck in their ways because they think they must be right, and everyone else wrong.  I think if we got rid of death it would only get worse, not better.

t1_dv05bln	0.296000	*	Well in the last few hundred years this would be pretty true.  I mean you don't have any modern examples of non-whites invading and taking control of countries to oppress whites.   
t1_dv0mwxo	0.440400	*	Edmontonian here, it was, and at the time it was like watching another man get tapped in the sack, a sympathetic wince, then a bit of chuckling.

t1_duwuk2w	0.000000	*	When the next post about 9/11 and Gander pops up (probably in til) you see how many people find it necessary to point out that it wasn't all of Canada but just newfoundland. 
t1_dv0l6ya	-0.476700	*	Damn, what they use would be pure. I'd end up like your friend.
t1_duh1u1l	-0.077200	*	Jesus. In good ole 'Murica if you talk politics in a bar you'll get a beer cracked over the skull just for being dumb enough to talk about politics in a *bar*.

t1_duolwzt	-0.431000	*	Well if a person can afford a $700 gun, youd think they could afford a $200 safe. By that logic, we shouldnt require poor people to buy car insurance.

t1_duxovbz	0.361200	*	This is incoherent
t1_duny2g4	-0.128000	*	We do that in the US armed forces as well. You'd be surprised at how many people can slip through the cracks 
t1_dui4shk	0.624900	*	I require too much culture to live in a 3rd tier city. Im sure its a fine place to raise kids if you send them to private school.

t1_duki9or	0.250000	*	I don't see what is strange about it? I downvoted the post of Delhan and Icecold and upvoted the ones of rubberband. This is how voting works, why would you upvote the baseless accusations.

t1_dv3xhfn	0.077200	*	Also worth noting that Moot sold 4chan around the start of all this, and lots of people questioned why anyone would buy it and how they'd make money. Perhaps by selling the site out to troll farms
t1_duthmkd	0.616400	*	This is not a per capita statistic. It is a fact that you cannot physically count 130,000,000 votes and expect any accurate results.

t1_duzydc2	0.000000	*	According to Wikipedia whites only take up about 8% of the population. So I doubt a civil war will last long of it ever happens
t1_dup31df	0.440400	*	Except the statement wasn't tied to the context of the news event but was presented as axiomatic.  Doing so made it a blanket statement which opened it up for mockery. 
t1_duv9oy8	-0.908100	*	Used to be the same in Finland (outside of stations). Shit will just become soil. Plastic won't 
t1_dv0rqzc	0.985000	*	Yeah, seems like all we hear about is the hellish office jobs. What about manual labor jobs, retail, and other out of office jobs? Are they required to overwork too?
t1_ducrzrk	-0.420100	*	Omg you can't just ask someone if they're a Sith!

t1_duexya9	0.624900	*	Oh cool, I didn't know. Did they reassign him?
t1_dv3ce4o	-0.077200	*	Serious answer. It's because there's a series of pro-Trump montages on youtube that all start with the song 'Centipede' by Knife-Party.

t1_dv1s3lq	0.000000	*	That's what I've heard.
t1_dunvbsj	0.347700	*	Why not? We in the US build monuments, put them on money, name libraries after them, give them the highest honor. Why can't Palestinians do the same for their freedom fighters? 
t1_duy64cq	0.000000	*	Maybe tell the GOP and the NRA that? They seem to be under the impression that their right to bear arms will be rescinded at any moment.

t1_dusqdnr	0.778300	*	Yes.  I'd rather the entire world end than a Chinese hegemony emerge.  Take that however you want, but if we don't get to live, you don't either.  So... y'know.  That's the game.

t1_duxp6ty	0.000000	*	Right, I don't know a thing do I?   What about drugs like Fentanyl? Last time I checked, that stuff can kill you with incredibly small dosages. Obviously, it CAN still be used in medical facilities

t1_duzxwc0	0.000000	*	These problems solve themselves! Running a country sounds easy.
t1_dunys8n	0.902200	*	A really easy example is the gender wage gap narrative. Its a lie that liberals trot out to curry favor with female voters.

t1_dud5j23	0.000000	*	My point is, we have to recognise that this is widespread and not exclusive to one particular candidate.  To just use it as an excuse to say FUCK DRUMPF!! is ignorant and misleading. 
t1_dv0fyy1	-0.812600	*	OK but since then your technology hasn't improved at 1/1000th of the rate of the military. You have better rifles and they have drones, tanks, airplanes, missiles, and all sorts of tactical gear.

t1_dudfhbb	-0.612400	*	Right, so you think it's reasonable to think the world is flat when it was disproven several millenia ago?
t1_dulc9ff	0.648600	*	Or just not running as many hydro generators.  Why use solar and wind to pump water up a hill when you could just use it to supply the load at the time and run the hydro generators less?

t1_dultl9v	0.898500	*	And we continue to be allied with Canada 
t1_ducz831	-0.806200	*	Clinton supporters need to come to terms with the fact that not all of the allegations levied against Clinton were fabrications of Russian agents.

t1_durnur9	0.702600	*	And why not? The population distribution is similar. The political divide is similar.

t1_dufgjza	0.690800	*	This reply makes zero sense. 
t1_dv0ou8y	0.000000	*	You are right, that could happen. However this hasn't happened mostly because without farmers most crops are bad at growing. (especially since most crop are hybrids)

t1_duske30	0.318200	*	maybe in 2020....2018 does not look good for the Dems. My models predict Senate gains for the GOP, but a slight chance of the Dems taking the House.
t1_duasfdf	-0.557400	*	We can join other trade unions. And some might rather be part of a independent country with its own say vs having to go along with a block which sometime acts against the interest of said country.
t1_duj0m00	0.491500	*	I guess being the aggressors hasnt worked for them. Their territory gets smaller and smaller. Are they aggressively giving up land? Is that what you mean because that make sense.
t1_dv02jwz	0.000000	*	How come we don't hear all the bullshit nativist arguments about immigrants taking away all the jobs when the immigrants in question are white?

t1_dv090kj	-0.636900	*	Its hard to reduce any compex matter to a single issue. Doesnt stop folk from trying all the time. Many things led to Trump.

t1_dv375o1	-0.153100	*	Interesting workaround but it's never been tested in court.  It's possible the government could order a company to leave their warrant canary up, even if they are under investigation.

t1_duzzpw9	-0.226300	*	What I am saying, and being downvoted for, is that if a bunch of white south africans are allowed into the country faster than someone else, that is not right.  
t1_duynbqm	0.000000	*	I've been using /s on a lot of comments the past year, because you can't say something dumb enough for people to know it's sarcasm.  /r might be the next step. It's short for fuckit who cares.

t1_dv0nnda	-0.534800	*	I would guess it's irrelevant because Le Pen is French and lives there, so she must follow French laws. Why is what the journalist said interesting? Speech and privacy laws are two separate things. 
t1_duo2vao	-0.296000	*	You must feel the same way defending terrorists.
t1_dv4x5at	-0.983300	*	Stun grenades are used by police force, also even if they weren't your comparison sucks. Police uses real bullets too, juat like soldiers in a war, have you seen the damage bullets can do?

t1_duyl53a	-0.273200	*	Wrong. I wouldnt have said a thing had I not verified it.  My question is why Google put the censorship in place and then abruptly retracted it and what the purpose was.

t1_dv0x2co	-0.585900	*	I think you just proved his point... If you want to have solid political discussion then present facts. Simply saying something like They lied! without any context isn't good enough. 
t1_duiqtyy	-0.994800	*	The only crime that carries the death penalty is drug trafficking. Singapore executes people for exactly 1 trivial crime. But yeah the 1 party dictatorship is no bueno

t1_duqwzdr	0.510600	*	I work in and study politics, I'm not going to read your shitty Wikipedia articles and imgur links.   The claim was simply that Venezuela was socialist, which it is not. 
t1_dv0vqnk	0.680800	*	Well dude, I'm on the far left and none of that nonsense applies to me.  You just confirmed that your whole view of the left is based on the silly stereotypes pumped out by Fox.
t1_dv0saa2	0.153100	*	I agree with you there.  But that is the companies fault and governments fault for allowing it to happen. That isnt the case any more.

t1_duzykfz	-0.451500	*	Sorry mate, but that is totally wrong. For example, the Melixe1 chain has several hotels in cuba, and also in US. They even have their Latin America and USA HQ in Miami.

t1_dupt73x	0.000000	*	So why lie? One of the weirdest things about Trump's Cult is that they seem so eager to give a select group the benefit of the doubt. If a dirty librul did the same they'd be losing their damn minds.

t1_duyl53a	-0.361200	*	Wrong. I wouldnt have said a thing had I not verified it.  My question is why Google put the censorship in place and then abruptly retracted it and what the purpose was.

t1_dv3m4xy	0.192200	*	Fascism is pretty distinctively right, politically.  There are definitely left authoritarians floating around the US now, but calling them fascists is incorrect.

t1_dupj0ec	0.000000	*	Not any semblance of a plan to balance, debt increase will offset the small temporary economic benefits especially as the Fed takes action in response.

t1_duhu2wb	-0.925300	*	> asthma medicine isnt banned  Is it? There is a process how you can apply for a usage of certain substances. It's not like everybody can take these asthma medicines and pass doping tests.
t1_dv0u4ea	0.850400	*	As an Irish person, I can confirm this. I'm not sure why either though, maybe it's something to do with the treatment of Irish immigrants in the UK, or maybe 800 years of oppression...

t1_dv2o1rn	-0.941300	*	Maybe, but The soldiers of a military despot commit rape is sort of a dog-bites-man headline, though. Aid workers raping? That's a little more man-bites-dog.

t1_dugot0h	-0.273200	*	Evidence to the contrary in terms of innocent. Russia does dope their athletes, and they are getting punished for something they are apparently still doing.
t1_dv1b48e	-0.273200	*	I would like to see the US follow suit and ban the use of the insecticide. Sounds like there was an effort made in 2013, but I didn't see anything in the wiki about them completely banning it.

t1_duqwwr0	-0.153100	*	The story says ... Im gonna call bullshit on this. If his wife, who was the main target, was able to leave the country, so could he. 
t1_dult0v9	0.000000	*	There isn't necessarily smoke involved at all.

t1_duki4vy	0.000000	*	Every disadvantage has its advantage is actually pretty translate-able, and makes as much sense in English as it does in Dutch.

t1_dv021xg	0.718400	*	No, what you need is like... an inclined plane that's designed to induce anxiety or dismay. Like a consternation ramp

t1_duyvyaq	0.661900	*	Instead of attacking me attack the argument. Your response is a typical one which is too simple and misunderstands the philosophy of antinatalism.

t1_dundrjw	-0.190100	*	Raises, maybe?    (I'm sensing my approach to English is getting closer to code debugging every day.)

t1_dudsoe7	-0.250000	*	More likely the marketing and advertising budgets.   Those commercials aren't cheap, especially when you need just a minute of airspace to cover just the adverse side affects.  
t1_dugrs1q	-0.519400	*	I completely forgot how Texas, the second largest state in the union, is a liberal hellhole. I also forgot the Senate doesn't actually exist.

t1_dui1utw	-0.690800	*	>Union bosses were almost always portrayed as corrupt snake oil salesmen.  If not outright communist in a severely anti-communist atmosphere. Look at how much Jack Warner whined about SAG and SWG...
t1_dv370t7	-0.077200	*	Clinton would have too.  There still would have been no way for Trump to win. Where was he going to find another 3 million votes?
