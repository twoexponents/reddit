t1_ds8xbsp	1	*	We didn't know that number was prime before. Now we know. We discovered its primeness.
t1_ds957pl	0	*	This isnt something for AI to do. AI are good at figuring out how to do things difficult to program, we already have a solid program for doing this.
t1_dsa035n	0	*	When you multiply 2 large primes you get a semi prime that is used in RSA encryption. Because the semi primes are so large its hard to factorise making the encryption more secure.  
t1_ds97vo2	1	*	can you fucking read
t1_ds9gx4u	1	*	That money is worth A LOT more in the encryption market
t1_ds95joq	0	*	Nope. As far as I know there's no known pattern to prime numbers. What you can do is guess and then check if your guess is correct, but that's not always easy :P
t1_ds8xu75	1	*	I can't even
t1_ds8wwt9	0	*	lol no, it'd take longer than 2 seconds. regardless no one is going to use a supercomputer for merssan primes  btw this took 6 days straight on an i5.

t1_ds9lfb5	1	*	> Have they tried dividing by 2? I would give that a shot before making any big declarations like this  By definition, 2^N -1, N a positive integer, is not divisible by 2.
t1_ds90zwm	1	*	Reading is hard
t1_ds9dih6	1	*	Yeah... we know there are an infinite number. But we don't know what they are. This is the largest one we know - that is why it is relevant.
t1_ds9aj3c	1	*	Unless you accidentally skip primes while searching, you'll *always* be finding a bigger prime, by definition - correct.
t1_ds9aofj	0	*	For science.

t1_ds8w2o0	0	*	ya'll talking in depth math things and im just over here laughing at GIMPS
t1_ds8ulqb	1	*	And that's still too much money. This is one of the most useless scientific discoveries 
t1_ds8xon9	1	*	Well it aint even either.

t1_ds96r7e	1	*	):
t1_ds8rv8d	1	*	This specific number? Probably nothing useful. Partly because big numbers are a pain to work with, and partly because you don't want to use famous numbers for a variety of reasons.

t1_ds966iz	1	*	Yea, but NOW I have to generate a new PGP key. Figured that number was safe for a few more years.
t1_ds92f1y	0	*	Yep, I can tell you right now its divisible by 5 :D
t1_ds8tlhc	1	*	Don't worry. When this crypto currency thing blows over the market will be flooded with cheap GPUs which can go towards BOINC projects, Folding@Home, etc.
t1_ds9a6k3	0	*	We didn't discover the number, we just discovered that this number is prime.

t1_ds8ydhl	1	*	That's numberwang
t1_ds8zjq7	0	*	Isn't it weird that prime numbers matter? It's basically just a rule we made up. 
t1_ds919y6	0	*	All primes (except for 2) are odd. It's still pretty strange though.
t1_ds9esyq	1	*	as some one who mines several crypto currencies... that 3000 probably doesn't cover 14 years of electricity costs.. and doesn't come close to covering the costs of the network...

t1_ds95eu3	0	*	> 7750 pages of single spaced, 12pt font on Microsoft Word just to type out the number.  its like the universe, it cannot be fathomed
t1_ds9fv4a	1	*	> I thought 23,249,425 was the number they discovered  No prime number (in base 10) can end in '5' other than 5, because every integer (in base 10) that ends with '5' is divisible by 5.  
t1_ds93yo1	1	*	Nope Decepticon actually.
t1_ds9dugg	1	*	What the fuck do those two things have to do with each other? Typical useless reddit comment 
t1_ds9d4bs	0	*	It's not, just cool for people who like math

t1_ds8vvh8	1	*	Stop it
t1_ds91cjk	0	*	Actually that is exactly what they do, but the computational power and memory needed to reach those high numbers is really big. You need really efficient code and really strong computers.

t1_duf42b4	1	*	That's fine, but don't get sand in your pussy when one headbutts you and breaks your fucking jaw. 
t1_dufwhh7	1	*	No.  The only animal rights group that has any authority in Australia is the RSPCA. And then it depends on the state.
t1_duev9h7	1	*	I agree. However, the animals still have the ability and right to fight back, and it should be a risk you take in account whenever you hunt.
t1_dufgow6	1	*	Ah, you've never met animal rights activists pal. They cray. 99% of the time.
t1_duq6cj4	1	*	Hey hold on a minute... What does weight have to do with that? I mean I'm with you Kangaroos are not endangered species but many others are and are pretty heavy like Tigers or Rhinos.

t1_dutgxxp	1	*	I see your point but by your logic free speech could be taken away as well
t1_duto2j3	0	*	Apparently it's actually more the educated middle class that are deciding they know better than the research (others have posted links, I've drunk too much to go digging them out)
t1_dutneop	0	*	There's no data showing that measles vaccines cause shedding, so I'm not sure where you're getting your information from about spreading the disease to non-immune people.
t1_dutk05f	1	*	God I was thinking of posting but guise correlation != causation as a sarcastic post.  And here we have someone that genuinely posted it.  Oh well.
t1_dutlgcz	1	*	Autism probably decreased, because you cant be autistic if youre dead.
t1_dutzagv	1	*	Because not everyone is able to be vaccinated you ignorant fuck.

t1_dutnquy	1	*	no, it's stoat-ally different
t1_dutk0dw	0	*	Im sorry to say the entire vaccine-autism myth is due almost entirely the fraudulent actions and publications of a single British doctor.
t1_dutrc31	1	*	No it would actually (eventually) decrease as less children alive mean less get diagnosed with autism.
t1_dutlzrx	0	*	Except measles does kill - http://vk.ovg.ox.ac.uk/measles  It can cause pneumonia in up to 6% for one and encephalitis in around .1% of people.  You also have to remember that the weak include kids
t1_duu9ben	1	*	my daughter has autism; and we already noticed the first signs before her first vaccination. It's in her DNA. Fuck people that don't vaccinate their kids.
t1_dutt0m2	1	*	And the Darwin Award goes to 
t1_dutj600	0	*	Which vaccines don't work?
t1_duuelve	1	*	unfortunately a lot of innocent get caught in the net (e.g. people from less populated areas or people from places with less doctors, or even non-EU citizens who did not have access to vaccination).  
t1_dutmqqn	1	*	I went to high school with a kid who had polio. His life was not an easy one. 
t1_duvc3mt	0	*	People are just repeating that now without knowing what it means.  Its completely causation.
t1_dutie7t	1	*	I bet they'd argue that it would decrease coz of all dead kids probably having autism would have have died as well
t1_dutipq1	1	*	Yes upper middle class white people are stupid in most countries about this. Thanks nude MTV host.....
t1_dutt46m	0	*	Just for the record, Andrew Wakefield was not the father or founder of the modern day anti-vac movement. He came onto the scene to help explain why so many parents were anti-vac.

t1_dutr06d	1	*	Vaccines cause adults 
t1_duvdhc8	0	*	Youd think the countries hardest hit by measles wouldnt be Italy, Romania, and Ukraine then since they arent taking in so many immigrants compared to the rest.
t1_duu9qpa	1	*	Unfortunately we have plenty of these idiots in Australia too. 
t1_duthf3v	1	*	Yes, they would, but they will never see something like that. And whose fault is it? Scientists did this to themselves.
t1_dutk1wm	1	*	Perhaps, but also stupid ideas that vaccines are bad for ya.
t1_dutgjiq	1	*	Luckily the 9 (not siblings) in my family have all survived. 
t1_duu7d7g	1	*	Problem is, it gives the disease a foothold and new chances to mutate. the stupid as you say risk taking everybody else down with them.

t1_dutqvhj	1	*	Yes, because America is in Europe.

t1_dutzulo	1	*	Well yes, but that's not the reason measles has 21,000 cases.
t1_dutkh3g	1	*	But I didn't get autism! (it hurts that I even have to do this.../s)
t1_duu3i95	1	*	Migrants and refugees.  Guess which groups saw a large increase in the time period of the analysis? 
t1_dutkjwf	1	*	Prayer doesn't happen overnight, sheesh. Sometimes it takes years! The lordt can't keep up with these diseases.

t1_duthnf8	1	*	Wtf
t1_dutpez5	1	*	Autism rate has dropped, that's because less people lived that were able to get autism. 
t1_dutrfy7	0	*	It also comes down to the massive amounts of immigrants who aren't vaccinated

t1_dv4blrd	1	*	I think some third world countries' internet connection is better. 
t1_dv4b6n4	1	*	Here in Italy they advertise 300mbps.   In reality, only a tiny area in Milan has 300mbps, the rest of the country is lucky if it reaches 100mbps.
t1_dv67qvc	1	*	But each dwelling has different quality shite copper so you'd hardly be able to give a median speed either. 
t1_dv67npw	1	*	Unnecessary, its a private member's bill which has no chance. Even if it did make logical sense, which it doesn't lol

t1_dv48ti5	0	*	>BUT DONT FUCKING RAISE PRICES OR TAXES TO DO IT, WHAT'S THE PROBLEM
t1_dv49w4j	0	*	Telia (a Finnish ISP) used to give us 6-7Mbps for our 9Mbps plan for 39.99/month. Recently they upgraded our neighborhood to fibre, and now we get 120Mbps for our 100Mbps plan that costs 27.99/month.
t1_dv48ek0	0	*	It's called fraud, I thought.
t1_dv4f7ln	0	*	It's because the current government took a fibre internet plan that was in motion and once they got in decided it needed more copper and more 30 year old cable TV network.
t1_dv4cubt	0	*	It's what they have been saying here.  That's what is considered misleading.

t1_dv4nggj	1	*	Capitalism.

t1_dv4lhwv	1	*	So all advertisements are true?

t1_dv66guk	1	*	No, it wouldn't.   But that horse has well and truly bolted now. And the Govt is suggesting 5G instead for those areas where the copper is too degraded for their shit NBN to work lol
t1_dv53nt9	1	*	Yeah theyre rates. The speed is like 2/3 c for cables and optics and near c for radio!
t1_dv4ac30	1	*	No kidding. They've openly acknowledged a false advertising problem and are considering banning it.
t1_dv54bqz	0	*	No.  The issue is that a lot of people are paying for one speed tier and not even getting the tier below.  
t1_dv4dre4	1	*	Better consider and have discussion about it. Than letting it slide no? We have to start somewhere.
t1_dv49ceo	1	*	Sorry but as an Australian this couldn't be further from the truth.
t1_dv4gyv6	1	*	Not what it is about at all.  It's about advertising different speed packages when you're not able to deliver anywhere near that.  
t1_dv4gvv6	0	*	Then none could because there are physics limits. That said, it's bullshit when they say unlimited then you get 2G speeds after 22GB.
t1_dv4duo6	1	*	third world internet connections beat the shit out of your first world ones
t1_dv4czsf	1	*	will achieve...thats a fancy way of saying youll ensure their connection hits 12mbps at least once and then who cares.
t1_dv4czsd	1	*	Shouldn't that fall under false advertising then? Which is illegal in a lot of places.
t1_dv66e4m	0	*	Sorry, but this whole story is bullshit. Due to being beholden to shite copper here, whatever speed you get it probably *is* the achievable maximum the line is capable of lol
t1_dv659x8	1	*	Exactly the same proviso is made here in Australia. To enact this supposed ban, *all* Australian ISPs would have to go lol
t1_dv4bwvi	1	*	Former AT&T employee here, and its rampant here in the US. Also if you try to get money back because your 1gb/s service never exceeds 80mbps you will get nowhere. We could really use a law like this.
t1_dv4ifvz	1	*	Is false advertising not against the law in Australia?
t1_dv4dqf6	1	*	Ironically in my country, which could be considered third world, I get the opposite. Been paying 50 USD for 120 gigs. Moves at that too.
t1_dv4dy6n	1	*	The US don't give two shits about us. Fake pitchers with only 40 ounces on them and cheater pint glasses that only hold 10 ounces.  Who cares, make money, fuck people! Woo hoo! And we love it

t1_du4ml51	0	*	Don't you guys have nutritional fact labels on the back of food like in the US? 
t1_du4i5bu	1	*	No because this informs you why a food is problematic for your health. If you have high blood pressure then avoiding foods high in salt can be rather important as one example.  
t1_dtse5eo	1	*	maybe a soup?
t1_dsutsv2	1	*	Be a rebel. I'll be good

t1_ds5etud	1	*	On the contrary, if this was a legal and widespread practice, you'd have way more women in every field than men simply because then the companies could pocket 25 % of their salaries.

t1_dte9qha	0	*	Why?
t1_du15ara	1	*	And 3 SAM batteries of SA-17 and SA-5 type, and 4 yet unspecified Iranian targets, and 5 more unspecified Syria targets in Syrian airbases.
t1_dtv2jdg	1	*	I'm almost sick of it. 
t1_dtv29zr	1	*	But then how would they confirm the long-running republican sentiment that government doesn't work? 
t1_dt3ttrg	0	*	What value do these coins have other then for illicit transaction and people trying to jump on the speculative train to the moon? 
t1_dub4skd	1	*	I dont think Ive ever seen that

t1_dto6rdp	1	*	I work with sales reps that are better negotiators than Trump. The sales reps know that any deal is better than no deal. No deal means money out the door and no commissions for them. 
t1_dto3y1z	1	*	I'd like to introduce you to Brexit.
t1_dtolpn5	0	*	This user is a violent white supremacist
t1_dto2qd8	0	*	First guy to throw a punch in a fight is a bully. Guy who steps up and throws one back is a hero.
t1_dto4fcz	0	*	It's expected of reddit. It's ok, better for us, more influx of readers to T_D.  
t1_dtoc2xl	0	*	Did you even read the article? It specifically says that Trump didnt mention anything about NAFTA, only trade in general. 
t1_dtnxbzn	1	*	You guys sound like Trump
t1_dto5zwk	1	*	Will Arizona residents still vote for Trump if there's no NAFTA?  If so they deserve what might come.
t1_dtogufx	1	*	> The Donald actually think Trudeau is his friend.  Don't know where you got that idea.  Many posts on there and 4chan make fun of trudeau and call him castro's son.
t1_dtpkei2	1	*	Go home you're drunk. 
t1_dtockco	0	*	You misspelled Trudeau
t1_dto16m1	1	*	Not to mention backing a deal with Trump when he may turn out to be a pariah.  
t1_dtopm90	1	*	Guy got elected on promise of making pot legal, which was the most effective way to rope in a fuckton of younger voters.
t1_dto0le4	1	*	Idk the details but I believe he said he was opposed to it (or at least said it was a bad deal). Sanders was too. 
t1_dto6ube	1	*	Bad for the people, great for the billionaires.
t1_dtnxaiv	1	*	Did you hear about the booming economy in the US?
t1_dtowfes	0	*	Does that same idea apply to the US? If President Trump feels we're getting a bad deal out of NAFTA should he be able to walk away from it?
t1_dtnz64v	0	*	 Because he is acting like Trump?
t1_dtobsi6	1	*	Yeah thank God we dont have Harper anymore.
t1_dtosuyg	1	*	Because Trump wants a one-sided deal. This twit has no concept of reason or reasoning, nor reasonable.
t1_dtod9cb	1	*	That is because Trudeau insists on an agreement where everyone benefits not just the US.
t1_dtnz9ae	1	*	He's doing what Putin tells him to destroy the west. It's working. This motherfucker better end up in prison.
t1_dtnwz6g	1	*	I know right?
t1_dto21ch	0	*	The sad thing is, trump probably thinks this is what he's been doing all this time, too.
t1_dtnzmuw	0	*	The difference is that NAFTA has been far more beneficial to Canadian workers than it has been to those in USA or Mexico.
t1_dtoprkn	1	*	and 70% of Canada's exports got the the US alone. If NAFTA disappears, I highly doubt the Canadians would dare start a trade war with the US
t1_dto0umy	1	*	That's the art of the deal.
t1_dtog6gj	1	*	It is still a full cent above where it started the year.
t1_dto7jws	1	*	Doesnt help that Detroit ended up producing only shitty cars. 
t1_dtoc48u	0	*	Sort by controversial and you'll only get gonorrhea at least. Lots of AIDS in top
t1_dtntkno	1	*	Unless its trump calling for the end of it. Then we try to justify NAFTA. 
t1_duz9w43	1	*	Its because all the American bees are republican lobbyists. 
t1_duysasw	0	*	bees are doing a lot better recently, but keep at it, it's too late, we're all gonna die, that's gonna convince people to care. keep at it buddy.

t1_dujlp1d	1	*	Holy hell I had read that in the article as 24k per *year* and was astonished how high the fine was... Makes a bit more sense now.
t1_dujcsog	1	*	>Glad to see the fine based on his income  He should have made himself a corporation.

t1_dumhruy	1	*	That 13 year old popular middle school girl was KGB all along. 
t1_dum4dij	1	*	Well, it's strange because Pentagon publish some shit that Russia can invade Baltic and fuck up whole Europe so Europe should build more NATO bases and US troops should be presented there.
t1_dum4o86	1	*	> as pretense that Russia's democratic in the slightest.  The guy is financed by the US, it's election meddling, the guy should register as a foreign agent.
t1_dun56cq	1	*	Suicide by driveby shooting with polonium bullets?  Probably not a big enough threat though.
t1_dulynhl	1	*	Its hard to start a movement when everyone with a voice is silenced.
t1_dulmwka	0	*	You joined Reddit less than three weeks ago and all of your comments bash Americans. Every. Single. One.  I call shenanigans.
t1_dur2y4o	0	*	Not quite. Relevant John Oliver: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=pX8BXH3SJn0
t1_dupmh0z	1	*	At least for basketball no one goes through the full four years because of the possible risk factor or bad playing that could affect their draft stock.
t1_dtzfhdr	1	*	Well you guys actually tried to rebuild Afghanistan but that didn't work out :/  https://www.vox.com/platform/amp/world/2018/1/11/16878056/afghanistan-us-fail-war-taliban
t1_dtz1hbh	1	*	until _The Cunt_ is deposed you're trading on political margin

t1_dtzhwum	0	*	Not there's no money to pay for it
t1_dtzg8bu	1	*	The US needs to form the American Middle East company, which has a lice service to use force to defend its assets. /s
t1_du006vc	1	*	Mission Accomplished 
t1_dtzm8gn	1	*	America can't even probably come up with an infrastructure plan for itself, where do people get the idea that they can for Iraq? 
t1_dtzenqa	1	*	O.j. gave the Goldmans so much money, yet they still dont like them... what gives?
t1_dtyzkxz	1	*	Because were Trumping it rn back home. 
t1_dubhxwo	0	*	Chill out bro. Just don't fuck with dirty birds
t1_dsgbkmw	0	*	Downvoted because you are an idiot. You are declaring Barack Obama a stalker and harasser for persisting after Michelle turned him down a few times.
t1_dsg7g3k	1	*	Ha yes, that's a good point- people give this shit a pass if the dude is hot, i agree. 
t1_dsghgcv	1	*	Definitely downvoted by the pussy grabbers.  
t1_dsl73c6	1	*	Its like throwing water on an oil fire. No thanks just stay out of it.

t1_dtv4qog	1	*	Well,his wife once called him  a little bit dumb in public.
t1_durwr31	1	*	I'm a history teacher and am teaching my students about WWII right now. We're lucky enough to have a 93 year old vet come talk to us in a few weeks. What a horrific time in history. 
t1_dusks1n	1	*	Tissues?
t1_durex0d	0	*	Um America was completely justified in using the A-bombs and even gave them warning. Japan has no one to blame for those bombs and that war in general 
t1_dur55r4	0	*	Flame throwers are most certainly allowed....
t1_durc2lp	0	*	The fuck does that have to do with anything?!
t1_durkidx	1	*	look at u/delcielo bringing out all his alts to downvote you
t1_durcw4k	1	*	Don't forget the atrocities they commited while they annexed Korea
t1_dush0qc	1	*	I think you are completely right. I didnt know much about unit 731 so I read about it and I am horrified. Appalled. Embarrassed and ashamed. :( everyone should know about the acts committed there. 
t1_durc57i	1	*	>China  Depends on your definition of China, of course. Taiwan wasn't treated quite the same as the mainland.
t1_dur73as	1	*	Didnt Japan atone for their sins after the war ended and are continuously still apologizing to this day with a memorial?
t1_dus80hz	1	*	ITT: let's invade neighboring Asian countries and mass murder their population and not expect any repercussions
t1_durbvs0	1	*	A weapon to surpass metal gear!
t1_dutjtvs	1	*	r/therewasanattempt  Can't blame them all that much, with their logistics being strangled by the Silent Service and their conventionals being whittled away...

t1_durdjvk	0	*	like you give a shit about the chinese of nanking. shut your trap. you're engaging in whataboutism
t1_dur56c0	1	*	It was kinda a kill one to save ten scenario.
t1_durplvz	1	*	Unit 731. 
t1_durkr3b	0	*	Thats a common theme in war unfortunately. Especially with prisoners. Only those willing to kill and steal were the ones able to survive. The righteous seem to always die first. 
t1_dureza3	0	*	precisely this. this is pretty massively hypocritical on japan's part. it's an international embarrassment more than a war testimony.
t1_dus0ook	1	*	on an unrealted note, how did you find a place to stay? unless you're japanese. I can't find an affordable/okay place to stay for the life of me
t1_durto20	1	*	Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha. You people are degenerates. You would let murderers get away with their crimes because theyre Nazis. Nazi apologists please go into the ocean, thanks. 
t1_durat90	1	*	>>Can we send some unit 731 survivors with them?  >Americans to send 9/11 first responders overseas to talk about terrorist attacks  >Can we send some Abu Ghraib survivors with them  You what

t1_durlv1c	1	*	It's so crazy we dropped nukes on civilians
t1_durbe6o	1	*	Sad as it was, the atomic bombs were necessary and, oddly enough, was a good thing for Japan in the long run. 
t1_dura9yi	0	*	Jesus christ the anecdote about the river is fucked up 
t1_durnp45	1	*	It's repulsive how people always feel the need to compare suffering.
t1_dur9tp9	1	*	Came here to say this. 
t1_durn48k	1	*	Well we did do that to say to them: Never Again. The Imperial Japanese Army was FUCKED up.
t1_durx3it	0	*	They should be financed by the Chinese government, obviously. But I guess you're too preoccupied with your hate boner to realize that.
t1_durf5ja	1	*	Thank you. 
t1_durbu7i	1	*	Chinese and Korean grudges run pretty deep, it seems, so they consider it retribution and thus justifiable.
t1_durc1lf	1	*	I did bookkeeping for years and as much as it sucked, I never had to count dead bodies so that's kind of a win, I guess?
t1_durc80d	1	*	The Japanese were prepared to arm civilians to fight against any invasion.   Millions more would have died had we gone for occupation, on both sides.   Edit: Let *that* sink in, ya smarmy cunt.
t1_durrgv8	1	*	War of attrition.
t1_durcri1	0	*	The fuck are you talking about? No one banned flamethrowers.
t1_durm9w2	1	*	The last people who were alive during WWII probably won't die for another 40 years.
t1_durxuo3	1	*	Never stop pointing shit like that out. Not until japan bends knee before the whole world, admits EVERYTHING, and begs forgiveness. While all the ultra-nationalistic japanese are made to watch.
t1_dus7jxy	1	*	Perhaps youre perceiving this incorrectly? Are they parading their victims or are they using their story to demonstrate to the world how much death and destruction comes from using a nuclear arsenal?
t1_duraut3	1	*	Hopefully not that soon! Dont die gran.
t1_duraqxq	0	*	But what about the revenge for the jews?
t1_dur7yhx	1	*	If Ukraine hadn't disarmed, Russia wouldn't have invaded Crimea. 
t1_durd8im	1	*	Then isnt it great that Trump is a Russian KGB agent?   Thats one less nuclear country to worry about, amirite?
t1_dutjypi	1	*	So... you would have been cool with Op Downfall if it would have avoided nuclear ordnance being deployed on Hiroshima and Nagasaki?  Yikes.
t1_durrgt9	1	*	If only the US were adamant about this not happening again.  Instead, lets build more Nuclear weapons to feel safe...
t1_du3bidl	0	*	But remember, when Americans say it, they're just being racist xenophobes.  -American leftists

t1_du7bde4	0	*	Yea but how'd the Time Crisis game go
t1_du7274p	1	*	it's not news, this sort of thing keeps happening
t1_du724yl	1	*	> edit: Where are all the people calling for the lynching of men accused of the very same thing?  They're feminists, not egalitarians.
t1_du83hni	0	*	Alternatively, wheres all the people preaching innocent until proven guilty, lets not just believe the words of some person etc
t1_du747kz	1	*	Well yeah, look at how little news Linda Sarsour got for enabling sexual harassment.
t1_du74h3w	0	*	Oh damn wow i guess it is good call bro
t1_dv364ok	1	*	should be way up and pinned.
t1_dv363kv	1	*	Sounds straight out of four lions 
t1_dsess0e	0	*	And then the British can have all the shitty slowed-down iPhones.
t1_dsf4hyc	0	*	They admitted to slowing devices with poor batteries. If the battery is replaced, it would revert to its normal speed. They didnt admit to slowing your phone so you get a new one. 
t1_dseuwzt	1	*	Open corruption and birbery called lobbyism
t1_dsf7l5t	0	*	Yes, you are right. I have notified France and they will no longer prosecute Apple. Well done !! Apple owes you big time.  Here have the Apple Blue Ribbon. 
t1_dseqrqp	1	*	Lol. Somehow I doubt that will happen even if French courts order they serve jail time. 
t1_dsf7die	0	*	Yes, you are right. I have notified France and they will no longer prosecute Apple. Well done !! Apple owes you big time.  Here have the Apple Blue Ribbon.

t1_dseztqe	1	*	This isn't forced....voltage frequency scaling is a normal power saving technique.
t1_dsfiz4v	1	*	**If I were**
t1_duz1pii	1	*	A lot more civilians dead mate. America shouldn't have gotten involved in the first place.
t1_duyealc	0	*	> countless of US soldiers dead  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_military_casualties_in_the_War_in_Afghanistan  Not really countless. 
t1_duydz2w	0	*	Agreed. The reason why US is acting hard on Pakistan was since the day Pakistan proposed Afghan Taliban deserves a right for talks.
t1_dshay3j	1	*	So in other words our entire economic foundation isn't good? I mean I agree with you, but I wouldn't have said it so blanketly.
t1_dsgxwh2	1	*	geed is ok, but only slathered on top of a nice bit of hedonism. You can't JUST be greedy. Gotta be a bit corrupt, too.
t1_dsohdhq	0	*	I agree with most of what you said, but downvoted it because the lack of tact in your statement made me actually feel like I was in the wrong for agreeing.
t1_dsu5utw	0	*	You post an awful lot about Turkey and in r/communism. Hmmmm. 
t1_dsu67od	0	*	Yeah, obviously the fact that they get to keep 14% more of it has *absolutely nothing* to do with the decision. /s  Give me a break.
t1_duy6qxq	0	*	Are you really 100?
t1_dtb9fg4	1	*	Hotels in Cancun are definitely not empty.
t1_dtc2058	0	*	you forgot step 8) Mexican ISIS
t1_dtc6jm8	0	*	Mexico is the eight most visited country in the world and tourism has grown by more than 5% each year. I can assure you hotels are not empty.
t1_dtbmtyb	1	*	I remember hearing pot quality went down in the US in the areas where it was legalized , but this is pure conjecture because I do not have a source  (became a quantity rush instead of a quality rush) 
t1_dtc63pf	1	*	Lol  Dog jumped up on my backpack. I was like fuck...did I leave a little something in my bag?? It was a banana :)
t1_dtbfv49	1	*	Probably crushed up aspirin 
t1_dtbiqki	1	*	There aren't too many bootleggers running from police and shooting up speakeasys.l anymore.  Let's do the same for drug prohibition.
t1_dtbhlx3	1	*	xa1Por favor alguien piense en los nixf1os!  Yeah we have those people too
t1_dtbvx3v	1	*	Same as the US. The corrupt officials make too much money to really legalize it. 
t1_dtbf20u	1	*	Man, the weed is soooo bad down there.
t1_dtbqxhm	1	*	This argument is retarded. 
t1_dtbgnvf	1	*	not the same as legalizing, decriminalization isn't about stopping traffic but about dealing with addiction.   
t1_dtb9smn	0	*	Spend the tax dollars on addiction prevention and drug education, free tampons
t1_dtc5wyp	1	*	It's the eight most visited country in the world. With a murder rate way lower than other popular places such as Bahamas, Jamaica, Brazil, Costa Rica and Colombia
t1_dtbqxje	1	*	The are big rea$on$ for putting people in prison. 
t1_dtb3duv	1	*	I'm here rite now, guy wanted 60 for a 1/8 of seedy shit. No thanks, I'll wait till I get back home
t1_dtc6662	1	*	Political cost
t1_dtbehzi	0	*	at this point i say we should regulate heroin. bad doses are killing people. fetanyl is showing up in cocaine too.
t1_dtbihzu	1	*	Except you're not removing illegal profit potential by legalizing it in *mexico*, because most of the cartels' drugs are sold in the US
t1_dtc9dnb	1	*	If they skin people for illegal profits without fear, then they will just skin the competition until they are a monopoly.
t1_dtbl4we	1	*	Cancun city? What about near the beach resorts?
t1_dtbeabf	1	*	Yes because murder is also a victimless crime.
t1_dsshebf	1	*	Having a Sudanese or Eritrean passport shouldn't be a free ticket to live wherever you want.

t1_dsti6j1	1	*	right
t1_dssw8by	1	*	it disrupt some Americans far far away from Israel from looking virtuous.
t1_dss7zgi	1	*	Not enough though. He still needs to oust Shas from the Knesset, but he decided instead to form a coalition with them. And I don't think the next PM will change it.
t1_dtpsylb	0	*	This government is so obsessed with the Austerity Agenda that anything goes. 
t1_dtfuqii	0	*	Well they just voted to release the memo, so we are gonna know a lot more within 5 days.
t1_dtfvvln	1	*	Carter Page is a fucking moron. Surely the Russians recruit smart people.

t1_dtfw6jj	1	*	I'm going to have so much fun with you in about 6 to 12 months... lol
t1_dtg7ytk	1	*	i'm sorry..what exactly do you think is the significance of the part of the article you quoted? 
t1_dtfy18w	1	*	I know, right?  They're such a great way of condensing information for future review.  I can't get enough of them myself.  Write them all the time at work.
t1_dtfk7sa	1	*	You forgot the part that says the Republican memo says Page was a spy. 
t1_dtexr0p	1	*	if they weren't legit they wouldn't need to be secret!
t1_dtfhxqe	0	*	Republicans paid for the dossier. Nice try though.

t1_dtibet0	0	*	That's what the US is already doing. No idea why you're stating the obvious.
t1_du36wfr	1	*	Creepy to me too. The bad news about how hackable the IOT devices are will hopefully also make people think about how hackable robots are. 
t1_ducom9a	1	*	Odd, my country is populated by morons.
t1_dtcf523	1	*	because otherwise no one would care about a 4 year old story and feel vindicated about their hatred for a certain group of people.
t1_dtc6yly	1	*	Yeah, that makes it more of a TIL post rather than here. OP dun goofed
t1_dsnrbgt	0	*	It's used by Hamas to smuggle weapons and fighters in. What do you want, exactly?

t1_dtk90um	0	*	Like, less than Trump and the Republican party? Or less than those with actual credibility?
t1_dtoxx5h	1	*	There's no indication that he was religiously motivated. Many right-wing terrorists aren't.
t1_duwx12f	1	*	The odds are certainly not in his favor. If Biden is the nominee, he'll be screwed. If someone like Warren is the nominee, then he has a chance.
t1_duws57h	1	*	Especially if they start a war.

t1_dt29hbb	1	*	There not, the only important thing is that this detracts from Trump.
t1_dt2d9za	0	*	Funny thing is, Turks are not really Turks, they are admixture of the local people and their Turkic part makes up small part. Real Turks are in Centeal Asia and Siberia. 
t1_dt7vyeg	1	*	So interestingly enough, the Arabic word for camel is remarkably similar in pronunciation to their word for beautiful. Beautiful camel is said, roughly, Jamal jamil.

t1_du8hwmf	1	*	So apparently there are some people that take offence with me saying it's a logical decision to go for a system like this. In what way would this hurt people more than help people?
t1_du8ptkr	1	*	Right? Most people are *left* with an insurance that won't pay this anyway, so why bother?

t1_du8ghyc	0	*	I 100% agree. If your not willing to give your organs you shouldn't be able to get them ahead of people who are. 
t1_du8ievg	1	*	Except they won't.
t1_du8sy17	0	*	Yeah theyre better until opting out becomes illegal 
t1_du8w9eq	1	*	Either a donor or not, Anubis will weigh nothing, because it'll rot in the ground otherwise.
t1_du8q6p8	0	*	Why? You wouldnt be using it. 
t1_du8iy45	1	*	They don't. The headline is completely inaccurate. You can, to start with, opt-out, and secondly, it's not 'automatic yes' as 'automatic no protest'
t1_du8hfs2	0	*	That would be true if the state could overrule your choice, but it can't, so it *doesn't* own your body.

t1_du8h1m3	1	*	This is what I told my wife.  Donate everything including eyes, skin, or whatever else they want.  Leftovers go to science and if science isn't interested to the incinerator.
t1_du8xgyo	1	*	This seems like a better approach.
t1_du8fs4w	1	*	Same people who vote pvv probably.

t1_du8in3k	1	*	I read about people on Twitter that had already registered as donor and were so furious about the law that they decided to opt out. I really don't get how some people's brain works. 
t1_duavu00	1	*	I would take it a step further. If you are against a woman's right to an abortion The state should force you to become  a living donor instantly....somone can always sustain their life off you now!
t1_du8qmzf	0	*	I don't think you can donate anything at all, maybe your brain? they should keep let people opt out. Half of the population out there got all sort of stuff that nobody want really.
t1_du8heow	1	*	What if in my next life Im missing an organ because I gave it up now. Maybe thats why people have bad or missing organs because they gave up it in a past life. 
t1_du8h243	1	*	I wont do it in the US because they sell your organs. If anyone is making money off of my body its gonna be me damnit! In europe where they dont price gauge the dying I'd be happy with it. 
t1_du90wbf	0	*	It is, if you can freely opt out. People are lazy, this just prevents laziness from depriving someone of life. Your wishes as the donor (or not) are still respected.

t1_du8g2rh	0	*	> those that care can opt **in**, those that don't help can live worry free they won't be harvested after death.  FTFY
t1_du8giwm	0	*	Because my organs wouldn't want to live with some stranger. 
t1_du8f3fv	0	*	Even though being a donor is now the default, the family will generally still get the last say, unless you specifically confirm that you want to be a donor.    
t1_du8fc58	1	*	More organs donors or not, that statement is simply false. 
t1_du8rqgd	1	*	A much more sensible default position than, Against your will we're signing you up. I would add a further policy, Here illegally? You're last in line unless no one else matches.
t1_du8fuyx	1	*	You can say no.
t1_du8f7mf	1	*	Where's here?
t1_du8hjeh	1	*	That's why I smoke, drink, and eat unhealthy food. They can't let me die to harvest my organs if all of my organs are shit tier. Gottem. 
t1_du8m96q	1	*	I wouldnt sweat it. 
t1_du8hayj	0	*	how? you don't need your organs when you die, but if you want to keep them you can.

t1_du8g7gb	0	*	What happens if you have medical issues that mean you can't donate? 
t1_du8w1qy	0	*	Wtf are you on about? Hahahahaha 
t1_du8lfvh	0	*	Better, yes, but I still can't think of a single reason why anyone should be allowed to opt out.   BUT MUH RELIGION
t1_du8us29	1	*	I really like this option. I'm sure there are many people who refuse to be donors but who would happily receive a donation when needed, which is hypocritical.
t1_du8puyq	0	*	Why not? If you can save a life/lives, why wouldnt you?
t1_du8j58d	1	*	You still have the choice. You can opt-out. It's not fucking mandatory. Can people read?
t1_du8l7ec	1	*	You make the decision. How is it government owning you when you get to decide what happens to your body?
t1_du8h1bt	0	*	Yeah that's not how paramedics work. They have one job, which is getting you to the hospital alive as soon as possible, whether or not you're an organ donor.
t1_du8ek56	1	*	So you weigh someone making money more than improving or even saving a life with it?
t1_du8nyoy	0	*	That's a terrible policy. People will only realize how important organ donation is once they need one.
t1_du8g20d	1	*	This guy gets it.
t1_du8qvtj	1	*	When everyone is a donor if a loved one is in need of a transplant all you need to do is cause a bloodbath near the hospitals he loved one is staying and there will be fresh organs to spare.

t1_du94zis	1	*	can you do trades? like, a kidney and a bit of liver for a new lung.
t1_du8wbk8	1	*	Well that a paradox, because you only give an organ when you are dead, and then you don't need one anymore.
t1_du8xrhl	1	*	Think they will take organs from the dead, no matter if they like them or not.
t1_du8m4hp	1	*	> Opt out systems are so much better  Yeah.... let us hear you say the same about telemarketing or spam or privacy online.
t1_du8hh6d	0	*	This is your government trying to extend the life as many people as possible. How horrible! A safety net what can save your life too! Blasphemy!
t1_du949si	1	*	Just donate my organs and throw me in the trash
t1_du9g7yl	1	*	That's just fine, friend. The law will probably result in a net increase in donors, so everybody wins!
t1_du8sidy	1	*	Because people who think frogs are gay also think the organs are removed while youre still alive and conscious.
t1_du8gdzp	1	*	Europe cannot escape its oppressive roots.
t1_du8fmrs	1	*	I opted out, but that is because I will donate my body to science. I'd rather help in that way.
t1_du8qe5h	1	*	Your spirit will live on in the collective
t1_du8fc1w	1	*	What's the point of everybody being donors if the doctors opt to let you die rather than use the plethora of donated organs they now have?
t1_du8ii1e	1	*	After death. Kidney and Liver still require approval (or whatever else you can donate).
t1_du94pu5	1	*	not when you're dead
t1_du8g00e	1	*	> showed me written proof  Let's see it then
t1_du8hovj	1	*	 I dont understand it either but these comments are doing wonders on shedding some light on how many self-absorbed people continue to take up space in the world.

t1_dtpp3j3	1	*	Why only him?   Why not label videos funded by all billionaires. Gates, Koch, Bezos, Adelson, DeVos. Do you honestly think Soros is the only person with an agenda that might not put you first? 
t1_dtp92j8	1	*	It's not inherently nefarious, but when it's from government with a track record for spreading misinformation, it'd be great to know if possible.
t1_dtp6x0z	1	*	I was going to say that and I'm glad I saw your comment first. Agreed. 
t1_dtp39ki	1	*	I care less about government progaganda and more about political parties and corporations
t1_dtp1s3n	1	*	Yesssssss I want to know who paid for the crap.
t1_dtpkz3u	0	*	It also means that a lot of modern music from lesser known Canadian artists might be labeled as the Government of Canada and the Government of Ontario spend a lot of money to promote Canadian artists.
t1_dtp3o20	0	*	Yep all the MSNBC, CNN, and FOX news videos made possible by funding from military contractors like Boeing and Raytheon will be free of the label and look neutral by design.
t1_dtp2hw0	1	*	Noooooooo! 
t1_dtp47jr	0	*	Yeah, basically the stuff you already knew had government funding will be labeled.
t1_dtp4qqu	1	*	The sponsored vloggers are the ones I want to know about.  The official news channels of various governments are sort of irrelevant so far as that connection is already well known.
t1_dtp0d9v	1	*	I mean that doesn't really tell us much. A lot of big channels are corporations and are obviously going to be funded by themselves.

t1_du5ko6w	0	*	This gets said a lot but clearly the idea is to lay out the money for construction and then get reimbursed some way. One way that has been floated is to tax remittances to Mexico.

t1_dtcvudg	1	*	Funny thing, Holocaust survivors are urging the government not to deport african immigrants. But i bet no shit is given about the survivors. Israel uses Holocause as a sympathy card and nothing else

t1_dsxb9g1	0	*	Because obviously you can't let a government regulation slightly decrease the rate of profit increases of a foreign corporation. They deserve their profit and the employees don't! /s

t1_dtvv96a	1	*	Reddit is so hypocritical about hunting it's insane. I can deal with the rest of reddit's far left opinions. But the hunting one I don't understand
t1_dtv3uy6	1	*	Yes you are that guy. Blathering excuses taught to you by your betters, never thinking by yourself just parroting parroting parroting ydda yadda yadda. Go and hide in the sewer you crawled up from...

t1_dtvq96a	0	*	I'm a meat eater also and I don't really see the difference between this and eating meat. I don't need to eat meat to survive and at least this animal got to live in the wild.
t1_dtvpnsp	1	*	Just because it's illegal to do so, it's wrong to take another humans life because he killed an animal. Any fellow Christian would agree 
t1_dtwoe0x	1	*	But it's okay for every angry hypocrite in this thread to close out the browser and eat an animal that was killed for their pleasure as needlessly as this lion?

t1_dttgp2r	0	*	Better funding would solve these problems. Push that way, not towards privatisation.

t1_dttcsi6	0	*	I once told my mom (im from Italy) how the US healthcare works and she couldn't even begin to think how that is possible. Land of the free /s
t1_dttf5eh	1	*	The reason people are protesting in the UK is because they're worried the government wants something even marginally closer to the US system with more private sector involvement.
t1_dttbi63	1	*	Millions of us vote for people who feel healthcare is a right not a privilege actually.

t1_dttl7s4	0	*	Wrong. Rich or poor, the NHS treats you the same. Rich aren't guaranteed better treatment in every country

t1_dttdker	1	*	Holy fuck. 
t1_dttjl1i	1	*	No, America can literally afford almost anything it wants. This myth of scarcity is simply a matter of where people want to spend the money. 
t1_dttgwig	1	*	No more than he realized he is too
t1_dttfydp	1	*	Looking at your last edit, what kind of basic care are you referring to that will lose you a house?   Is chemotherapy basic care? 
t1_dttt82f	1	*	Should write uninsured as 0 vs 28000000 just to rub it in. No commas either, so people are just dazzled by how horrendously large that figure is.

t1_dttedco	0	*	The NHS is an embarrassment.

t1_dtthn49	1	*	If you make < 50k as a single person or 96k as a family you're health insurance is capped at 9% of incime.  Despite that because it's not baked into taxes people just don't sign up

t1_dtultr7	1	*	Yea but Britain's population is 66 million and United States has 323 million. It's almost like with more people, it's harder to give out medical care!
t1_dtxts2f	0	*	That poor kid was suffering. 
t1_dttez77	0	*	Blame the government of the last 8 years. It was in a good state before they started interfering with how it was run up until that point.
t1_dttgrdm	1	*	Appendix op is something a lot of people in Britain go through in their young years and to read that such a thing could leave someone in debt like that is terrifying! 
t1_dttm9b6	1	*	It's not meant to be taken literally. It means that you don't need a lot of money for healthcare, as opposed to the US where insurance is expensive without a job that provides it. 
t1_dtteoge	1	*	Had to shoehorn Brexit in somehow didn't you? 
t1_dtteit0	1	*	>I'm young, healthy, and pay $250 a month.  Pretty sure I pay less than that in National Insurance here in the UK.    **Edit:** xa327,500 wage, and xa3193.36 a month goes on National Insurance (tax). 
t1_dttepv8	1	*	And to a lot of the developing world 
t1_dtt9xt1	1	*	The word healthcare may be redundant in that sentence.
t1_dttjnfx	0	*	What's the wait time for your average 5 figure service?
t1_dttgy8h	1	*	Oh, he does want to replace the US healthcare system... with something absolutely worse.
t1_dttgw35	0	*	This has nothing to do with healthcare. If much rather get cancer in the US than the UK.
t1_dttoi13	1	*	53k? They want blood.  Do insurance companies actually pay out that much or do they get some kind of premium plan rate? I can almost understand why they need to deny so many claims.
t1_dttnuoh	1	*	It really isn't.
t1_dttmbiv	1	*	With the people it really doesn't, but it would destroy enormous well lobbied companies, so yeah you can see why were fucked.
t1_dttchon	0	*	I have a job. It doesn't include any health benefits whatsoever.
t1_dttfxyf	1	*	You can usually get medical assistance through the hospital...  I've seen hospitals write off complete bills because the patient can't afford to pay.
t1_dtu3lpd	1	*	fucking LOL USA. I love seeing how stupid we are.
t1_dttbzae	1	*	So your problem is that people like the things that he posts and you don't like that a liberal / democrat 'agenda' is popular. 
t1_dtthcbg	0	*	12.50$/hour is less then what 15 year olds working part time next to school earns here in Norway. Do people in the states actually make less then that an hour? 
t1_dttba94	1	*	It needs that now.
t1_dttezea	1	*	Too much privatisation leads to this. Appendix surgery is avg of 50K INR here. Which is 720USD. 
t1_dttbmfi	1	*	It is great, and it's main issue is the Tories are a pack of pin-striped locusts who want to underfund it until it breaks, so they have an excuse to sell it off to their friends.  
t1_dttsvub	0	*	The average American spent $9596 on healthcare in 2016. the amount an average family on an average employer sponsored health plan paid over $5000 on their premiums alone for that year. 
t1_dttdb30	1	*	I assume quite a lot of people outside the US are aware of the outcome of the popular vote. 
t1_dttkxkp	1	*	That's the difference between you and an American. An American would gladly save $1000/yr on the chance that their entire family will be perfectly healthy their entire lives.
t1_dtthfxj	1	*	Didn't know you could ever trade nothing at all for something.

t1_dttd69s	1	*	For a party that rejects evolution they sure do like to encourage its mechanisms.
t1_dtty1oj	1	*	If a nation that complains about anything and everything for fun complains about something, try not to read in to it too much.

t1_dttb5pz	1	*	That can be fixed by finding. You get the policies of the government in power. Aka don't vote Tory
t1_dttk48v	0	*	Go for it, not sure why people talk about it so much and never do. Go see the world. 
t1_dttt6pa	1	*	I see tumor and operate  Definitely life crippling debt, in the US
t1_dttaeou	1	*	It's also likely that doctors don't want to operate on your grandmother because very old people don't do very well after invasive procedures.
t1_dttjfda	1	*	That must be going to affect the rest of your life hugely. Sorry :(
t1_dtti0gu	1	*	Lol. Keep spreading your knowledge 
t1_dtti0g5	1	*	Because the NHS is being slowly privatized and intentionally defunded, largely because of corporations and corrupt politicians lobbying for an American-style system.
t1_dttuwsj	1	*	Pretty sure I wouldn't have a house if I broke a bone.
t1_dttbwf1	1	*	Everyone like to grumble about stuff like that. Some of my teachers were a bit shit when I was at school, but i'm pretty fucking glad I live in a country where everyone has access to education.
t1_dttu9n3	1	*	Thank you. My post was saying the same thing. Reddit is full of US college kids with romanticized ideas of European system of healthcare. 
t1_dttchur	1	*	I think the fact I had to agree with Jeremy Hunt is thing that upsets me the most about Trump. 
t1_dttb2ao	1	*	But...what if your tax dollars go toward paying for healthcare for some lazy person who doesnt deserve it? THE HORROR!!
t1_dttdp2c	1	*	With you on this, if they need the money for the NHS, I am very happy to pay more National Insurance to help! Unlike Trump we like to look after everyone in the UK :)
t1_dtukamh	1	*	I second that.
t1_dttiwan	1	*	Did you know private healthcare still exists in UK? If people prefer it over NHS why dont they use it?
t1_dttb9lu	1	*	Holy shit, same situation here but I live in Europe. Just now I realised what a privilege this is...
t1_dttbzd2	1	*	free in France.
t1_dtti9ks	1	*	I just don't understand how these idiots are so against this.  Some of them are the same people who are gaming the fuck out of the system too.
t1_dtthf8z	0	*	No ones forcing you to stay. 
t1_dtthyov	1	*	I was working in the UK for a while and I can confirm that UK is x(times) better than the US in my eyes :). 
t1_dttedsc	1	*	universal healthcare can coexist just fine with small government. a good country is a healthy one and that can only happen when people have access to healthcare, both the physical and the mental one.
t1_dttaxec	0	*	Currently the NHS is a bit of a mess, receives nowhere near enough funding which has been evident in the way it's performed under heavy stress
t1_dttesuo	0	*	The shame of it is that the US has the best medical centers in the world.
t1_dttfs7x	1	*	You wouldn't even have to pay that much to fix the NHS at the moment. An extra xa31 a week from everyone would suffice
t1_dtticje	0	*	Sitting in an office as well, and just glad my wife has decent health insurance so I'm not getting blasted with that type of bill. 
t1_dttj4y5	1	*	Because the Constitution doesn't promise that but does promise (if you do some mental and legal gymnastics) guns.  Good work, capitalism! :(
t1_dttbfwd	1	*	He just wants to be like Kim Jung Un, have it's citizens belief they are the best at everything ever. Trump rejects your reality and substitutes it's own.
t1_dtt9zgh	1	*	A simple gift of tea. 
t1_dttebz9	0	*	Im glad people like you only have 1 vote. Trump is clearly the best president that America has had in years but I guess if all I listened to was the mainstream media then I would share your opinion. 
t1_dttdjrt	1	*	lol U0001f602U0001f44c
t1_dttclio	1	*	I thought the US essentially didn't have a healthcare system

t1_dtta9ua	0	*	All the same, try to keep your president on a leash, it's terribly embarrassing. 
t1_dttczbj	1	*	The hospital where I work as an RN charges you for the next day starting at midnight. So whether you discharge at 8 am or 5 pm, youve already been billed for the day. 
t1_dttmceo	1	*	Jesus fucking christ.  And Republicans defend our incredibly fucked up system, and want to go back to a time when it was even worse. Absolutely disgusting.
t1_dttd6z7	1	*	I dont think the shittiest shit country would want to have the same model America has. Its incredible for a developed country to have that poor health service. 
t1_dttcw57	0	*	Then why do tens of thousands of Canadians seek treatment abroad if the Canadian system is so much better than the USs?
t1_dttk2kl	1	*	Neither system is perfect. Both have flaws and issues.   It's just laughable that anyone would call the US system better. 
t1_dttsm1a	1	*	I can wait that long in America, and then have an ER copay to go with it. 
t1_dttcfna	1	*	Everything about the US under Trump is a joke and he doesn't realize it. Don't expect him to start doing so now. 
t1_dttediv	1	*	Kenyan here.    Even as a developing nation, our healthcare vis a vis the economy is a whole lot better than the US which is so much richer than Kenya. 
t1_dttfko1	1	*	Do you seriously believe that doctors in the UK have to work for free? 
t1_dttckil	1	*	> ambulance ride would have added roughly another $2-3k  wat
t1_dttamgk	1	*	In the US, our healthcare system combines the worst of both worlds. It is not socialized and it's not free market capitalism.  
t1_dttfjin	1	*	Move to Finland and leave the fuckers empty handed!
t1_dttgho7	1	*	Soemthing Obamas fault, don't want to pay for all the blacks and Mexicans who all don't work ..oh and the most important it, pisses dems off.. ..thats what I get from comments at least.
t1_dtu1czl	1	*	Those figures are averages though, and skewed by the poor uninsured. If you eliminated them and just had to count the proper hard-working Americans then the US would come out on top.  /s
t1_dttjinw	0	*	Where did you get that information, if I may ask? I've never heard of it

t1_dtdyxmf	1	*	It sounds similar to asking a conservative if racism exists anymore in the US. Theyll swear up and down it doesnt and minorities arent oppressed.
t1_dte0yfg	1	*	It's sickening as how fucking corrupt the Russian police force is compared to US.
t1_dtduvg4	1	*	They will need more that the whole population of Russia to make any changes. Putin has too much money and influence to let some street protest change something.

t1_du7yp3t	1	*	US Forces just killed a number of Russians on vacation in Syria and will probably do the same for vacationing Turks. 
t1_dsye0t3	1	*	I wouldn't say most.  Some European countries do, but most countries are far worse than anything you could imagine.
t1_dsxijmv	0	*	How the fuck is that lenient? Thats a fair sentence. Too many people are used to the U.S and their insane sentences. 
t1_dsy84hl	1	*	Rehabilitation doesn't increase revenue for privatized prison systems and to the US profit is way more important than societal change or improving living standards or any of that gay liberal shit. /s
t1_dsxwfhj	1	*	Considering the man wasn't involved in killing or injuring people beyond moving bullets it seems reasonable.
t1_du3m4e6	1	*	That is visa fee. I think USA have one too. I think this is exactly like thatbut for smaller area.
t1_dtxu6en	0	*	I mean, working for either company looks damn good on a resume though.  It wouldnt be a bad spot for a young kid to start out of school.

t1_duq1fe6	0	*	> Looks like they acted in self-defence  Man rushes IDF soldiers armed with fully auto rifles and in full combat year with an iron rod or whatnot --> minimum response is to shoot the guy  okay
t1_duplbmm	1	*	The official statement atm is he got shot that caused him to die and had bruises.  EDIT: I am now reading what I wrote (while sober) after I had some drinks, how did I manage to fuck up so bad? 
t1_dup80nz	0	*	Israel is an apartheid state that practices colonialism.
t1_dup7v97	0	*	Yup, it's only one Palestinian. Only one Palestinian has ever been treated illegally by Israel...

t1_ds2w0dc	1	*	So religion inserting itself into science and medcine only to fuck with them and ban things from them, yet again.  Sounds familiar.

t1_dsxsg93	1	*	Victims have claimed that the other bishop, Barros, was in the room when the abuse happened.  By saying that the accusations against Barros are all calumny he's accusing victims of lying.

t1_dt1oi23	0	*	Eh, it's easy. See, a black man was elected to POTUS in 2008. And that kind of scrambled their brains.
t1_dstrcwz	0	*	Exactly.  They already know and they are just trying to pretend they don't take money from anyone who offers.

t1_dsdwibu	0	*	Where were the complaints when Obama ended TPS for multiple countries?
t1_dseg6ho	0	*	They built their lives legally but not permanently.  They built temporary lives.  Keep in mind, TPS doesn't mean they can't leave, just that if they leave, they lose the protection.
t1_dsenbxb	1	*	Probably creating a precedence of not letting people stay forever when they were given temporary stays.

t1_dsdwpom	1	*	That was Bush #2, aka Shrub.  That seems like a century ago.  Plus that was more of a campaign slogan than a policy directive even then. :(

t1_dtwo6h1	0	*	I was just thinking that this seems incredibly prejudiced. 
t1_dt7dyyq	1	*	 I'm suprised it doesn't happen more often. Converts fit in with the far right more often than not. 
t1_dt6o0me	0	*	Wait a neo-nazi converted and then killed his neo-nazi roommates?  Or you meant a neo-nazi fake converted then killed his new muslim roommates?  Sorry super confused.

t1_dt60xj0	0	*	Or he found it to be the level of conservative that is not found in the developed world.
t1_dt6j2gz	1	*	Yeah but there's no indication that he went to another extreme. Being Muslim doesn't suggest extremism in itself.

t1_dszawrs	1	*	Are you making a concerted effort to be a human shitstain, or does it come naturally?
t1_dt9nllk	1	*	No. Probably more in line with the hoax bomb threats than anything.   Even if it were to somehow survive, it would need to find a highly improbable break in the skin barrier. 
t1_dv42o52	0	*	While this is indeed correct, it is certainly misleading to imply that somehow Poland made gains as a result of WWII.
t1_dv41vl1	0	*	There are still people left who see that Poland doesn't equal PiS. At this point I would actually be surprised if they pulled anything else than nationalistic PR stunts.

t1_dsn7n3a	1	*	That was probably super scary. But on the bright side, you and everyone who reads this knows there is actually some system in place to alert us of these issues. Had no idea.

t1_dsn90ue	1	*	All the other stuff is good advice, but you should also check out [ham radio](http://reddit.com/r/amateurradio), which is a great local, highly redundant communications method. 
t1_dsnevmt	1	*	I'm willing to bet that the nuke message software has a drill mode that wasn't set. The test procedures call for actually sending the message.
t1_dsnl2pg	1	*	Most probable outcome? Regime change.
t1_dsnma8t	1	*	Nah, If it was a real missile Pyongyang would be burnt to a crisp by now.
t1_dsnq1v0	0	*	Yes because telling people they are about to be nuked would be a great idea... people still have no idea what to do it, I mean it's a damn nuke there is next to nothing anyone can do.

t1_dsnnx2u	1	*	I wondered what happened to the FAA we too low, bang ding ow intern.
t1_dsnkfpr	1	*	It appears that too many people took the time to screen shot the alert and post it to Twitter...
t1_dsn6ea8	1	*	Maybe you should prepare, this should be a headsup.
t1_dsnyugt	1	*	does this constitute terrorism   the government causes a widespread panic, convincing citizens that their death is impending while providing no guidance 
t1_dsn8wxx	1	*	It was 38 minutes.
t1_dsnrl5m	1	*	In times of crisis people show you who they really are.
t1_dsn417a	1	*	I hope they fix it so it can't happen again.  My God.
t1_dsn9mgc	0	*	They'd for sure be dust within hours.
t1_dsnc4h2	0	*	*calm
t1_dsnnbgt	1	*	The problem is they never received an alert.  The local EMA just didn't set the panel to test mode and they picked the worst possible option to mess with.

t1_dsn5lon	1	*	this is why we need to pre-emptively nuclear attack north korea, to prevent anything like this ever happening again.
t1_dsnfas2	1	*	They already said on Twitter the mistake was done at state level.
t1_dsn1qe5	1	*	Hope it doesn't hit you unless you have a bomb shelter, go in that.
t1_dsnh09y	1	*	I heard from Family... Same thing happened at Target and Walmart with customers. Shelter in place doesnt mean kick everyone out.
t1_dsn50fh	1	*	If there is a real future threat, battery powered, hand crank charged short wave radio. 
t1_dsn5pki	1	*	It sounds stupid enough to be real to me
t1_dsng7kb	1	*	If any of those happened the government would say ooops. We hit the wrong button. They would do this to prevent panic. 
t1_dsmyzff	1	*	Someone was just testing to see how it would function. Next unscheduled and unannounced test will be West Palm Beach... /s
t1_dsn72qw	1	*	At least you had an alert. News correspondents are saying not everyone (gathering tourists and a few unlucky residents) never received any warning at all. 
t1_dsn754b	0	*	This seems like a reasonable response. 
t1_dsn7wa8	1	*	hug each other, because if the blast doesn't kill you, the nuclear fallout will...   
t1_dsnnpik	1	*	No, this was an issue with a civilian activating a system used by civil authorities.

t1_dsnhywj	1	*	They get emergency alerts in Kenya? /s

t1_dsnm9z0	1	*	I'm more curious to know if that person knew he accidentally hit the button
t1_dsn73qf	1	*	I disagree. If there's ever a need for a real alert, God forbid that there will be, many people will question its validity or even completely ignore. 
t1_dsn68ve	1	*	bait

t1_dsnk3ig	0	*	Yes. You very much so would. It should be noted that a North Korean ICBM of 150KT wouldn't even destroy all of Honolulu. The chances your family survives are VERY high.

t1_dtzxkz3	1	*	Because some people need to build their self-esteem by assuring themselves that they're superior to others, and they always need groups to feel superior to.

t1_du02ro5	1	*	Not only that, but they're charging people for it.
t1_du00230	1	*	*READ THE ARTICLE*

t1_dshsq3w	0	*	It's additional insurance for prescriptions, dental, and eye care. Some really good plans will pay for private mri/other services to skip the wait in the provincial systems. 
t1_dsgydwr	1	*	Even gods can fall 
t1_dshfdz1	1	*	They cannot afford the higher minimum wages without raising prices that Canadians don't want to pay.
t1_dshtcn1	1	*	But.....but what if you're from Buffalo?
t1_dsgyj0t	1	*	How unfortunate when a national identity is represented by a bloody fast food chain.  It's nice to live in Quxe9bec where there's a strong sense of identity and ethnic pride.
t1_dshcudc	1	*	I can understand liking other coffee better, but overpriced? Tim Hortons is definitely cheaper than any other place that Ive gotten coffee at.
t1_dsh3ghd	1	*	>way over price their drinks  TIL $1 for a coffee is overpriced.
t1_dsh5v2m	1	*	People just want somewhere to live and food to eat not to crazy.
t1_dsgxway	1	*	You tried to invade Upstate NY with your Tim Hortons, but we repelled the invaders!  (To be fair, Krispy Kreme bombed here, too. Guess this is Dunkin Country).
t1_dsh0ypo	1	*	Every road trip in Canada started with a Timmies run. 
t1_dsh0om8	1	*	Provincial not Federal. Try to keep your hate straight. 
t1_dshlbi1	1	*	They've leaned into this Canada loves Timmies crap so hard in their branding it's ugly. Canada's Favorite Coffee is manipulative horseshit.   
t1_dsh4m7x	1	*	No way. In bc the mandate is 1 unpaid break after 5 hours. 
t1_dshynx6	1	*	Most Canadians will tell you that their coffee has gotten worse over the years.    Now people mostly go there because it's a habit. I will go sometimes because I like the breakfast sandwiches. 
t1_dsh09xg	1	*	I feel your pain. D&D makes pretty good bagels though!
t1_dshju0j	0	*	It is not 32%, it is 21%.  $11.60 before the hike, $14 now. Even the expected $15 is only 29.3%  Not sure where that site you write got its figures but they are wrong.
t1_dsgso76	0	*	Let us help these employees by getting their place of work shut down.  Hello, many of the employees at the one affected restaurant asked people not to boycott because they need the jobs.
t1_dshiqyg	1	*	That theater is hype. I used to got there whenever i went to the movies until i moved out of Oakville.
t1_dsgxgjl	1	*	So, Live by the sword die by the sword?

t1_dsi5hh4	0	*	People who work for a living are mad about exploitative business practices.  Understandably you dont have a frame of reference for the discussion.
t1_dsgxtrk	1	*	I'm in a pretty similar situation. I'll go to a locally run cafe if I want good coffee and in the rare situation that I'm in a rush, I'll go to McDonalds.

t1_dsh6azq	1	*	this is just a response to the $15 minimum wage hike. I too am pissed about that hike and support their actions.
t1_dsh3hgv	1	*	I find it funny how people who evidently do not have jobs are out protesting on a weekday, about people not getting paid fairly.  
t1_dsgyd7f	1	*	This is what Ive been saying

t1_dshgkyq	1	*	So them raising their prices in summer in advance of this means nothing????
t1_dshmo4z	1	*	Buy product, receive identity.  Something about that doesn't sit well with me.
t1_dsgxglb	1	*	Need more drive thru coffee shops then..
t1_dsgxwvn	1	*	I love the term phonetically-memorized greetings 
t1_dsgybyt	1	*	I would go as far as saying Tim Horton's Coffee is offensively bad. Probably the second worst cup I've ever had.   Their food is mediocre, and their donuts are fine at best
t1_dsgz203	1	*	Isn't there a class action launched by many franchisees against the owners, because the decrease in quality has been wrecking their brand since they bought it?
t1_dsh5shp	0	*	Your an idiot cost of living on canada has gone up more than 30% especially housing in Canada. How do you buy a $500,000 bungalow on 11.50 an hour? 
t1_dshba01	1	*	What the heck, you cant exploit your competent workers! Better?
t1_dsgyuy8	0	*	Yes, my friends at Tim Hortons deserve to be able to afford anything. 
t1_dsgy8x2	1	*	There *needs* to be a unionization movement inside Tim Hortons.
t1_dshkwja	1	*	whoops
t1_dsgxf4j	1	*	Oh calm down. It's mediocre coffee yes, but it's not like it's swamp water. It's just very generic coffee which is, and this is important for many people, consistent and easy to get.
t1_dsh30gh	1	*	Yes. But then the increase wouldn't be associated with a particular politician or party. It would just be a common sense thing outside of politics that no one talks about.
t1_dsh54ht	0	*	They make pretty good hot chocolate.
t1_dsgyy1i	1	*	The wages no where near doubled 
t1_dsh0d49	0	*	Confirmed Canadian, Tried to have an angry rant, apologized twice.
t1_dshd36f	0	*	There are several Tim Hortons pulling this move not just one.

t1_dsgxsbo	0	*	And if the employee doesn't like it they can find employment elsewhere.
t1_dsh2zai	1	*	Gotta have my Timmies! makes me cringe so damn hard. 
t1_dsh0dcc	1	*	Good points all around. Let us not forget that Franchisees do not set prices for the items they sell.
t1_dshfn16	1	*	> Loblaw's can do whatever the fuck they want  Well except for when they jacked up the price on bread and now I'm getting a $25 giftcard for their scummy pricing.

t1_dsgzb07	0	*	Tim Hortons made almost $100 000 000 in Q3 2017. They are doing fine. They can afford the $8 extra an hour to staff the place. 
t1_dsh42y1	1	*	Lmao first world problems. I'm glad we're worried about real issues here. r/nonotpettyatall
t1_dsh2zc5	1	*	The ones in the US aren't very good anyway.

t1_dsh1k15	0	*	other countries manage
t1_dshsjly	1	*	Maybe they can no longer afford it. 
t1_dsh3wxv	0	*	On top of that that franchisees are not completely free to raise prices on their own.  What do people expect them to do? Operate at a loss?
t1_dsh3k2t	1	*	Fuck their employee over? Ya well when labor goes up by $5 over night, thats $200 per full time employee every week, aka $10,400 a year.   Quite a bit of money 
t1_dsh03gt	1	*	Bob Loblaw?

t1_dsgzqk0	1	*	Tim Horton's means nothing Canadian to me and never has. Robins Donuts is where it's at.
t1_dsgy46y	1	*	Not sure how that would work, cosidering Tim Hortons operates by abusing the temporary foreign worker program. 
t1_dshzazg	1	*	If I had an option of making 11.40 an hour, with 2.5 hours of paid break a week ($28.50 / wk) , or 15 dollars an hour ($144 more per week) you best believe  take the $15 and be smiling

t1_du4c6r0	1	*	I he can get out in 4 years then the whole thing is probably bullshit. If he was actually guilty he'd get life.
t1_du4c1rc	1	*	US politics has become like reality TV for the rest of the world. 
t1_du4br45	1	*	He took a plea deal.  100 years was what he originally faced.
t1_du4bfpw	1	*	Ive seen him called a moral void, but at this point its more like a moral sucking chest wound 
t1_dt97dlk	1	*	Buy american then.
t1_dt9c1sg	0	*	How would this improve the quality of the US appliances? 
t1_dsljzod	1	*	Ahhahahahaha after everything that has come out in Hornywood Im betting a lot of these pretty ladies and actresses are regretting some of the dick they took
t1_dtkhnse	1	*	I asked the same of my mother and she went batshit. She reads the daily fail though, so there's not much I can do.
t1_dslrtyf	1	*	hmmm, I wonder... what is the connection....<jeopardy music> scratches orangutan head. 
t1_dsm06u9	0	*	Yeah. Fat, greedy people who voted for that guy to lead them. That's how we see you.
t1_dslys45	0	*	Or that time he allowed Hezbollah to traffic drugs and stolen cars to get his Iran deal passed!  Wait a minute.
t1_dslwaug	0	*	What? His own administration admitted that he said it. Stop shouting fake news every time you see something negative about him
t1_dslzcou	0	*	And here you are in complete hypocrisy, saying its likely hes a racist asshole.  The left really thinks it has the ability and the right to read minds.  
t1_dslsimx	0	*	Man, it's got to be hard to swallow getting eviscerated at every turn. I applaud you all for sticking to it, even if you are getting paid.   Keep swallowing it though. I'm enjoying that.
t1_dsm0qom	1	*	Trump has successfully eroded the standing of the POTUS on the world stage, so I dont think hes as powerful as you think.  As the leader of the Senate, Mitch McConnell probably has more power.
t1_dsm01ez	0	*	The dems should have an easy time of it. Whoever their candidate is criticised they can just point to a moment in the trump presidency as what the gop represents. 
t1_dsm06ak	0	*	When I am really curious, I ask people where there blood is from. Clears up confusion pretty well.  Edit: It's a polite way to ask without implying the person is foreign. 
t1_dslywp3	1	*	What? A source? The fuck do we need that for? 
t1_dsm3oyf	0	*	Republicans get by on feels and hatred. No one who believes and researches in fiscal responsibility or stable economic issues has voted R in years.
t1_dslwuft	0	*	I really wish more people understood this. 
t1_dslwih5	0	*	Somewhat off-topic, but how did the quotation marks you used end up being real quotation marks instead of double prime marks?

t1_dslxb17	1	*	> two anonymous officials told NBC News  [seems legit](https://i.imgur.com/3SrFJkM.jpg)
t1_dslw084	1	*	I agree she was the better choice but to be fair she should have known to campaign more in Michigan and Wisconsin. Bernie destroyed her there. Wish Biden could have run

t1_dslxnp2	0	*	> Why do we keep getting collectively shocked by the nonsense that our screens funnel to us everyday?  You should start here and really question your reality. 
t1_dsm52ll	0	*	These are concerns to be having during the primaries and during the election. Not... during the presidency... 
t1_dsm2eqa	1	*	Remember that time Obama sold guns to Mexican drug cartels?
t1_dslz5jd	0	*	Fake? You're delusional. And Trump's numbers are in the toilet even in red states, so your claim is doubly false.
t1_dslywl8	1	*	You would think she would be a sexy women, but I guess not. Pretty sad! I like sexy women. 
t1_dslvr2y	1	*	Trump sounds dumber by the day. I can't believe it's even possible.
t1_dslwncz	1	*	No.  Do you? Really?
t1_dslz5ym	1	*	Can someone just honey pot Trump and take one for the team so we can boot him from office?
t1_dsm3cty	1	*	The Trumpman show
t1_dslyeqa	1	*	OR! When the stupid house ni**er ate arugula! Trying to be white!   /s

t1_dsm6q81	1	*	I'm an Iranian American happens to all of us. 
t1_dslytky	0	*	Obama wasnt calling other countries shitholes and questioning why pretty korean ladies werent representing north korea.
t1_dsly3ye	1	*	There are plenty of shithole places in the US.  
t1_dslxm8o	1	*	Trump also might have been surprised because Ben Carson isn't only black, but was running for president. It's like not knowing who Mitt Romney is. Kind of inexcusable if you are a lawmaker. 
t1_dsm2hwe	1	*	I almost feel like Cartman would be a better leader
t1_dslxgil	1	*	He'd probably tell you to fix the problem with his Xbox.
t1_dslvsb5	1	*	It seems we are the more asshole country currently.
t1_dslsxuo	1	*	Words sometimes escape me.
t1_dsly3dd	1	*	Reddit loves to make big deals out of absolutely nothing

t1_dslwdjg	1	*	Wow.  I didnt know about this one.  Do you have links?
t1_dslvqxo	1	*	Hey, they wanted an outsider, someone just like them. They got him.  Reminds me of this prescient exchange from [Blazing Saddles](https://youtu.be/ZZvT2r828QY). Way too pertinent nowadays.
t1_dsludyv	1	*	After visiting Switzerland, yes.
t1_dslzyp9	1	*	So you're implying POTUS should apologize to North Korea's Supreme Leader? 
t1_dslxunl	1	*	I miss when the biggest contraversy was when Obama picked the wrong clothes
t1_dslzjh5	0	*	Not really. The people who at this point still support him will probably not see anything shocking enough to change them ya know?
t1_dsm20jq	0	*	Its dumbfucks like you that helped put this piece of shit in power.
t1_dslxe29	0	*	What the fuck are you talking about?
t1_dsm5hl6	1	*	Reminds me of that white African who got a scholarship from an African-American group. They did fight him im court and still had to pay from what I remember.
t1_dslw7vw	0	*	What about my presidency
t1_dslw8av	1	*	Nah he ain't Democrat he's republican dude
t1_dsm265s	0	*	Do you really think that unicorn exists? Trump was literally elected on a platform of ignorance, anger and hatred. If there's any moderates left, they're independents.
t1_dslv66w	1	*	Well, in his defense, Korean girls are very cute.
t1_dsm28gs	1	*	As an European, I don't understand how anyone voted for him during the elections...
t1_dslyazn	1	*	Nope. 4 senators. 
t1_dslx407	1	*	why are you even shocked?? I can totally hear him saying this in my head no problem.

t1_dslw9vu	1	*	Nah, cheese-puffs. Cheetos are too skinny.

t1_dsm6llv	1	*	Assuming the next will apologize. 
t1_dslvq5a	1	*	oh you mean when a democrat pretends to represent most of America and apologizes to the world? When will you guys give up and understand that you *aren't* America
t1_dslzqm5	1	*	Where is he from?
t1_dslxo54	1	*	Remember when he didn't wear an American flag pin on his lapel? Simply shameful.
t1_dslvj2g	1	*	Will you red hats ever figure out how Journalism works?  Between Journalism and polls its like you people were born full grown in 2016 and have no idea how the world works
t1_dslvg8z	1	*	He is the frontman for the the republican controlled senate and congress.  People don't remember Raygun or Dubya why should they be worried about this being remembered

t1_dsly73e	0	*	You mean the 3 republican senators who say that he said it?
t1_dsm1u7g	0	*	If he didn't want the job why did he campaign so much more than Hillary? Furthermore why would he have Russia interfere in our election for a job he didn't want?
t1_dsm4sgp	1	*	Were you just as angry when Trump cited anonymous sources during his birther attacks against Obama?
t1_dsm956r	1	*	Ummmm 5th avenue?

t1_duds943	0	*	As long as their industry is dominated by patent monopolies, their prices are determined by what customers are willing to pay rather than by anything to do with the cost of production.
t1_due2vhp	1	*	Was it Zohydro or Hysingla? Ive seen good stuff about it. But its practically brand new. So the expensive aspect is very true.
t1_dudir5u	1	*	We shouldn't punish people for taking medication. 
t1_dudt4tf	1	*	CBD is great when you need to be productive but suffer from pain and anxiety. In an illegal state, just bought a 30ml CBD vape oil for $35. I'm sure it's cheaper elsewhere.

t1_due06cp	1	*	Similar thing for a newer type of accutane. The drug is $800/mo, but if you ask for a free discount card from the manufacturer it's $5/month. Insurance is not applied at all. It's mind boggling.

t1_dtcozeh	1	*	You will, though.  Trump will do what Erdogan tells him.  He's still sorry from that time when those protesters got in the way of the Erdogan's bodyguard's fists.
t1_dsj7u22	0	*	You mean like the Trump/Russia collusion story?
t1_dsj8kju	1	*	What?
t1_dsj5ji2	0	*	What the actual fuck are you on about? Cry fake news when you didn't even fucking read it. Sad to say, typical.

t1_dumeu8g	1	*	I am fairly sure there are no liberals (or liberal bots, is that a thing?) encouraging armed protest and violence to protect their right to own dozens of assault rifles.  Sources?
t1_dum19rf	0	*	Lots of investors banking on finding a way to properly monetize the thing. It is pretty big.
t1_duldc6g	1	*	The story gets so few upvotes because, at this time, people are getting fed up with all the delusional crying babies americans are.
t1_dulsn6r	1	*	Really nice strawman you got there. 
t1_dum8vdq	1	*	You know how to stop this? Stop using Facebook and Reddit. Problem solved.

t1_duler8y	1	*	I'd imagine so. Saw a video the other day showing how you can even get fake news onto the front page of Reddit by spending only $200.
t1_dulq05a	1	*	Well said. It worked for the Soviets, it'll work just fine for them too.
t1_dulw7mz	1	*	what if every country hires their own bots to comment on social media about other countries.
t1_dul5eae	0	*	Meh, gun control debate is a complete waste of time.  There are far too many moderate & liberals that are fine with guns and gun laws.  
t1_dulet38	1	*	It's easy enough to use a proxy server and set your default language to English though.
t1_dulca6k	0	*	Sounds like a John Oliver joke. 
t1_duli93q	0	*	You're being sarcastic, but we've already seen that the answer to that question is not obvious.

t1_du53ujy	1	*	Nah we'll just eat them.
t1_du54cnt	0	*	To be fair that's exactly what the shareholders want. It's been decided decades ago that dividends are more valued than societal good.  Guess which generation decided this.

t1_dsq4ndx	1	*	Your re-enforcing your confirmation bias about adults because of something that a child did. 
t1_dsq240o	1	*	The unfortunate part here is that she might face consequences... from her family. Depends on why she lied, or possibly why her family believes she lied. 
t1_dsqbl5y	1	*	That sub has been infected by far-right trump lovers as of late, so its not surprising.
t1_dsq0qbg	1	*	It was an obvious hoax considering it was meant to be on her way to school or something, and the story broke at 9 in the morning.
t1_dssjf6d	1	*	What if I told you some people just want to be seen as the victim, its a very real and very common thing...
t1_dsq8bud	1	*	To your edit, we live in the world of clarification and precision, you'll never get a benefit of the doubt anymore and it's sad.
t1_dsq91l0	1	*	I think criticizing the kid is not wrong. She lied about something very serious, and I'm not convinced she didn't know about the consequences of that lie. 
t1_dsq5v1k	1	*	You know what would pull the teeth of the news agencies?  Adults dont hate each other based on skin tone and religion. People growing the fuck up would solve this like a boss.
t1_dspzcbl	1	*	If I wanted to manufacture strained relationships, thus sort of story is perfect.  It targets either a specific thing, and when it fails is alienates.  Win-win if I want no one to like a group.
t1_dsq5f05	1	*	But you have to admit that the fact that it was a Muslim it makes it that much more polarizing, whatever side you're on. 
t1_dsqkp8z	1	*	Absolutely. Fake hate crimes happen regularly. There's a useful website that keeps track of them (it seems to be down right now, unfortunately: http://fakehatecrimes.org/).
t1_dsq46bs	1	*	The same thing he says every time he is wrong, nothing. He will pretend this never happened and try and change the topic to some useless topic that makes him look good.

t1_dsq1shh	1	*	In the prime ministers short statement, he did use language that implied he wasnt taking the story at face value.
t1_dsq2728	1	*	You mean stories by 11-year-old girls? Come on, you can't let THIS become your go-to thing to point out as a counterpoint to any reported hate crimes.
t1_dsq4c21	1	*	34,000+ reported hate crimes between 2008 and 2012 in the US.
t1_dsq3f1g	1	*	Its an 11 year old girl who lied. She's 11. She's about to feel really bad when she gets older.

t1_dsqm7uw	1	*	Actually there is a good study on this.  And I do find it disapointing to say.  But the majority of hate crimes against Muslims are bogus.
t1_dsq75rp	0	*	The exceedingly more common response to a hoax of this sort is to say I am glad the previously reported crime did not occur.  It is seemingly perfect from a PR standpoint.

t1_dsqac63	1	*	> What's more surprising is how adults blow this story up to fit their agenda  It's not surprising at all in these days. Remember the (obviously) false claims about attacks after Trump's win?
t1_dsq9emg	1	*	this serious? A girl might have got her face mask tore up by some ass. That obviously shouldn't happen, but it is hardly a serious matter worthy of front page/worldnews. 
t1_dsq3k5m	1	*	I said the same thing to my girlfriend, she did not beleive me.  It looked way to fake the way the girl and boy were saying it, very rehearsed and didn't seem upset.
t1_dsq1t7a	1	*	Why would you think that?
t1_dssremg	1	*	And then this story got way more upvotes than the original one, and you felt like an asshole for assuming that nobody cares about truth more than they care about an agenda. 
t1_dsrd8hi	1	*	Yes. I agree. The whole thing reminds me of an act of cringe anarchy on her part.

t1_dsqbaci	1	*	But a white male supremacist attacked a young Muslim girl. Cannot wait on that news 
t1_dsqotel	1	*	With all the fake hate crimes that have been reported, it makes you wonder how many sexual assault crimes being reported are also fake or exaggerated. 
t1_dsq3ghu	1	*	Nah looks like this one hit like a Rolling Stone retraction 
t1_dsqa31u	1	*	To be fair, this isnt the first instance of something like this happening. If they were going to go that route, they would have already.

t1_dsq1dlu	1	*	She's 11. She probably doesn't understand subtleties and backlash like that. 
t1_dsq1vrv	0	*	No, If people treated Muslims better they would not have to lie.
t1_dsqg1g5	1	*	I was thinking they shouldn't have put her on TV and let her embarrass herself like that.
t1_dspvdv3	0	*	but I just want people to look at me
t1_dsqf3xn	1	*	Maybe someone should be asking?
t1_dsq2ddr	0	*	Very valid and respectable point. Only thing I'd say is...it wasn't you guys, it was just an 11 year old girl.
t1_dsqbgt2	1	*	Yeah but it won't get them those clicks!
t1_dsq38g7	0	*	Are you calling an 11 year old girl a perpetual victim?
t1_dsq3hya	1	*	But that's the thing, they don't care about their cause. They just want to be the victim themselves.
t1_dsqa8xs	1	*	I remembered your post when I woke up and saw the whole it was a hoax news cycle. Well spotted, you made me think about it the whole day. And you were right. Opened my eyes. Thanks 
t1_dspvgo3	1	*	lol its all over Canadian subs so you're wrong.
t1_dsre8ye	1	*	So, what actually happened? Was the hijab cut? Who cut it? It wasn't cut? The whole thing made up? Why?

t1_dsqapnp	0	*	Where does it say that the family beat her up?

t1_dsqiald	1	*	Good quote. 
t1_dsq9nyd	1	*	I remember that SVU episode.
t1_dsq391u	1	*	Trudeau might have gotten trolled. 
t1_dsq4ugv	1	*	That person probably says that every time there is an alleged attack against a Muslim, so they're bound to be right sometimes.
t1_dsq28pu	0	*	The area is also covered in cameras, if it had happened one of them would have picked it up. The kid just made shit up for whatever reason, maybe they just didn't want to goto school.
t1_dsqunni	0	*	yeah but it was White Guy Terrorizes Muslim Girl so it's Reddit GOLD.
t1_dsq4afw	1	*	Who are you talking to? That one girl or are you using it to hate all brown people in the world even more now?
t1_dsq94m4	1	*	You left out the perpetuates the beleif that hate crimes are a) whites against anyone else, b) that hate crimes are on the increase. 
t1_dsq0i02	0	*	> People who resent you, now resent you even more.  People who use commas like this, do not understand, how they work.
t1_dsqibvz	1	*	Lots reported it as fact.
t1_dsq6als	1	*	Cool, do you have a list of confirmed hate crimes?
t1_dsrd217	1	*	Medias care more about who broke the news first and how many viewers/online traffic they generated than sourcing/proofing.
t1_dsq67m4	1	*	This is just more jumping to conclusions - just as bad as the original reports. Let the police do their thing before passing judgement
t1_dsq1zeh	1	*	She's 11, probably ripped it on a tree branch and had to come up with an excuse.
t1_dsq1ze9	1	*	Dude, she's 11. Children don't get charged for wasting police time.
t1_dsq340z	0	*	Was it the one on the college hockey team cause that episode was bull shit. 
t1_dsruhgo	1	*	Maybe they are protecting the girl in this case?
t1_dsq7kcz	0	*	/r/HateCrimeHoaxes/
t1_dsq3rh6	0	*	One of the quotes from police said something like She didn't understand the seriousness of what she was doing or something like that.  Strongly implies it.

t1_dt2s4fw	1	*	Probably Ferengi though.
t1_dt30hht	1	*	There's a great book called The Good Nurse based on a true story about something similar that happened in the US.
t1_dt4fy2v	1	*	What is not to buy?
t1_dt3rc9p	1	*	its like that black mirror episode
t1_dt2wmy6	0	*	This has happened plenty of times before.  I know there was a lady in Nocona Texas that did the same thing years ago.  I don't think they are copies, I just think there are some fucked up people.
t1_dt3o5ep	1	*	*He
t1_dtzs9ss	1	*	Pretty sure its gonna be 140%
t1_dtznau5	1	*	How long in between each one though?
t1_dtzsclz	1	*	Sounds like democracy to me!
t1_dtzouwe	1	*	Indeed. Clearly that guy had some demons.
t1_dtzp8rs	1	*	Unfortunately all those who didn't turn up later commited suicide by two gunshots to the back of the head.
t1_dtzrztu	0	*	That has got to be the dumbest thing I have read all week.  
t1_dtzlyfq	0	*	Hmm shot 13 times in the back with a .357 magnum, clearly a case of suicide.
t1_dv1s22p	1	*	Because fuck the world apparently. We just really like getting close to midnight on the doomsday clock I guess.

t1_ds64lwb	1	*	Plenty of options. 
t1_ds6d41v	0	*	There literally isn't one. We cant get supplies through Iran and China for obvious reasons. The central asians countries can't help us since they are landlocked. That leaves only Pakistan.
t1_ds551xz	0	*	Turn over Bin Laden, or we will fuck you up.  No.  Okay.
t1_ds4wkdy	0	*	Great pivoting.   We will have enough threads to talk about that. Can we focus on the topic at hand.
t1_ds6fdho	0	*	Oh, wow ... and the U.S. signed off on that? *Fantastic*.
t1_ds52glc	0	*	Put an /s . You might give people the wrong impression.
t1_ds669zs	1	*	Pakistan is already in China's camp, there's no point keeping up the charade now.
t1_ds5dh2u	1	*	Uhm when did America give Saudi Arabia aid? It is more like the other way around to be fair. 
t1_ds68gf6	1	*	We are nothing compared to India and the US. Rest assured Mangesh.
t1_ds54iiy	1	*	I know a medicine. Oil and lobbying
t1_duqd7zo	0	*	Yeah the wording implies there are no more wild horses at all. What they mean though is that all wild horses today are descended from domesticated horses.
t1_dt6aar4	1	*	Trump is actually an experiment in creating a Kaiju through judicious application of spray tan, diet cokes, sleeping pills and mcdonalds.  Trust me, our time will come.
t1_dsywv7z	0	*	IM ERIC!
t1_dsz21xb	1	*	I know someone who went to school with Trump Jr.  He was apparently a complete and total douchebag.  When I heard this... oh about 15 years ago or so I wasn't in the least bit surprised.  
t1_dsz7dg9	1	*	I had a nightmare Trump tried to shake my hand
t1_dsywz1o	0	*	Not really? No it would be absurd and unethical while he was POTUS. Too bad nothing matters anymore.
t1_dsz4fa8	1	*	I don't know the connection from Jr/Sr; but if you were meeting Sr. there is a high chance that he will just repeat what you tell him
t1_dsywvzq	0	*	I'm sure there is a number.
t1_dsyxrmq	1	*	No modern president made money on the office they wait til they leave and get those speaking fees.

t1_dv4jeje	1	*	> safe heaven in the U.S.A.  It think you meant haven.
t1_dv4hn0q	1	*	They mean all those Russians are watching their backs and being afraid to leave the country the rest of their lives.
t1_dtk4zz6	1	*	i dont think so.. 
t1_dus5xur	0	*	I'm surprised you're not boosting Russia more, going by your posting history.
t1_dsugk1a	1	*	We shall see, now won't we?
t1_dsbuqcv	0	*	Yeah, let's ignore how the military was already brutalizing the population for decades before that.
t1_dsezrfp	0	*	Really? What kind of battery does your phone use?
t1_dsetj6y	1	*	> battery replacement industry  Like that is a thing... Its not battery costs are falling dramatically thanks to economy of scale. Gigafactory alone doubled battery production on its opening. 
t1_dsf900i	1	*	Just like the phone booth industry stopped the mobile phone industry?

t1_dtanwej	1	*	She was a champion to herself. Only.  Enough people knew that.  That's why she's not president. 
t1_dsnxmxs	1	*	They turn the wood into coal to use as fuel to live.
t1_dsnt2rj	1	*	And you believe this so much, you had to post it on your throwaway account?
t1_dsnzzbj	0	*	Its not about Haiti being a shithole. It is. Its about trump thinking that people from shitholes (I.e, brown people) arent worthy of a chance at the American dream while white people from Norway are. 
t1_dsognpj	1	*	because people can totally do that without reliable money and a corrupt government
t1_dsodxxn	1	*	It's not like they can cut off financial aid 
t1_dtrwtye	1	*	Well, are you saying their wrong? 
t1_dtrsuqs	0	*	Proof?
t1_dtsvmf6	1	*	The person who conducted this attack IS an Israeli.  He attacked another Israeli.
t1_dt1l1r5	1	*	They probably pay as much attention to that as you do to the kent state shootings.
t1_dt1h3to	1	*	For real.
t1_dt19820	1	*	A hoax, like global warming according to some really stable geniuses
t1_dt1dlf0	1	*	All of China's problems will supposedly be solved when they roll out their universally social reputation system.
t1_dt25xfp	1	*	It's an oligarchy. Look at who gets put in office (any- not just the president).
t1_dt1ifg2	1	*	In America, you can argue with the government.  In China you can also argue with the government, but you can only do it once.
t1_dt1jufa	1	*	I love lamp 
t1_dt1p0of	0	*	You might want to look into [Sesame Credit](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesame_Credit?wprov=sfla1).  China is on the verge of leveraging social media to a truly terrifying extent.
t1_dt1rb48	1	*	At least they have their shit together
t1_dt1nsz7	1	*	was it ever? representative democracy isnt really democracy when lobbying allows companies to vote against the common peoples best interest.
t1_dt22a7s	1	*	No, its not. It's a federal republic. Hell, your vote's weight depends on the state you live in. Thats very far from democratic.
t1_dt1u14e	1	*	Its mostly because Academia (Teachers, profs, and etc) is dominated by Left Leaning people. 
t1_dt23mp2	0	*	yeah cos sun keeps rising it mean you are doing it right? clue: sun would keep rising even during nuclear winter, its just you wouldnt see it for all the clouds.
t1_dt1qjal	1	*	That was my first response as well.
t1_dt1jyrw	1	*	Remember when we had a President that didn't idolize the Chinese cracking down during that event?
t1_dt1ejka	0	*	classic American whataboutism
t1_dt18y0l	1	*	Pff.  While Trump is a trainwreck, things haven't been good for the majority of Americans for a very long time...
t1_dt1olwj	1	*	Bring back the queen. Let her solve the budget mess
t1_dt1rvm7	1	*	China doesn't have famines anymore. Singapore is no better as to your standard of a good political system.
t1_dt1elky	1	*	Arguable when people win without the most votes and the will of the voters is ignored without having the most money.
t1_dt1ep6u	1	*	Chucklehead
t1_dt163dq	1	*	...so no homeless or need for shelters in the states?
t1_dt4793r	1	*	China isn't implying that it has no problems in this statement, only that the USA has problems.
t1_dt23xzd	1	*	Also just because US Democracy is flawed (which it undoubtedly is) doesn't mean ALL democracy is flawed. There are much better democratic systems out there.

t1_dt1aei6	1	*	Would be nice if you as a voter could do something about it. /s
t1_dt12k46	1	*	Athenians would disagree 
t1_dt1bcnf	1	*	Yeah a government where the people in charge do whatever they want and tell everyone else what to do doesnt really need to build a consensus. 
t1_dt2mhpu	1	*	that is why they are calling it chronically flawed.
t1_dt1bkoh	1	*	Why would they? 
t1_dt1ckhk	1	*	You can say fuck Donald Trump and everything he stands for without mysteriously disappearing, in china too.
t1_dt1ch96	1	*	Not entirely true. You can be in China and say Fuck Donald Trump and everything he stands for without any repercussion.
t1_dt1z51d	1	*	>Hey, at least we can see ~~the vaginas in~~ porn videos!  FTFY, since porn is flat-out illegal in China.
t1_dt1jr24	1	*	Happy cake day. Here is the mandatory upvote.
t1_dt19up3	1	*	Its more the form of democracy.  Theres a reason why most democratic countries around the world use the Parliamentary system of governance over the American Presidential style. 
t1_dt1fnmd	1	*	So you've seen every single government shutdown in US history then.  That's, kinda cool in a weird way.
t1_dt1kqew	1	*	They do manage to imprison the highest per capita number of their citizens though. Unlike China
t1_dt1fm4l	1	*	I said the same thing it happened last time it happened. I'm going to be cutting deli meat and putting boxes on shelves either way.

t1_dt1aphm	0	*	A lot of critizism for someone who has all your jobs and makes all your stuff.
t1_dt1b57d	1	*	The shutdown is not a flaw in the idea of democracy, which is the notion that China wants to perpetuate. The shutdown is a flaw in the US's specific implementation of that idea.
t1_dt1lhtx	1	*	Right? The government isn't everything in a republic like it is with Communism.
t1_dt1lf4x	1	*	It's not a democracy. It never has been. It's a democratic republic.

t1_dt1iar9	0	*	Well, we did have the time to have all those slaves, and kill all those natives. But yeah, China really doesn't have ground to stand on for their current policies. 
t1_dt1iqwx	0	*	Then you die because you cant afford health care

t1_dt1nret	1	*	Norway #1 so far
t1_dt1j08k	1	*	Yeah cool, unreliable protagonist but can we really argue the merit of the sound bite? US democracy is basically a sham at this point.

t1_dui8a1v	1	*	I'm guessing this is Bill's pseudocode he wrote in his head.
t1_dui7gg3	0	*	how many here think the government should not be bought by corporations or individuals or countries that have too much money?  Is this not a more appropriate question?
t1_dui8s0d	1	*	This but unironically
t1_dui6fhb	1	*	You know that's not what he was getting at. Unless you didn't actually read anything he said in which case your comment is completely irrelevant.
t1_dui7lfx	1	*	Because then the poorest would have a massive tax increase from where they currently are as would huge chunks of the middle class. 
t1_duiagqi	1	*	Wealth makes you reckless with money.

t1_dui0o6i	0	*	He means that it shouldn't be up to him.
t1_dui87ib	0	*	I don't know, Gates and Buffett have each donated over $27B each to various charities and organizations. It's hardly fair to put MediCare responsibility on them.
t1_dui7sfa	0	*	One of the only non-politicians I'd vote for.
t1_dui324q	1	*	The problem is almost all due to offshore accounts tax evasion and tax loopholes. If everyone just paid All they owe at the current rates, we'd have a massive multiplier on current govt intake 
t1_dui8yvi	0	*	The top 50% of earners in the US pay 97.2% of all taxes.
t1_dui7o85	0	*	Gates is one of the most generous philanthropists on the planet.

t1_dui7i2i	1	*	Have you met Tyler Durden?
t1_duicaxf	0	*	Yeah, he could just be like Mitt Romney and pay a higher rate one year for political gain. Theres nothing wrong with Tax Avoidance. Hes still saying the system is fucked that his rate is so low 
t1_duiax3s	1	*	The key is to de-privatize capital. Stop allowing a handful of individuals to wield unchecked power.and influence over the lives of everyone else.
t1_dui9lun	1	*	This by so fucking much. We already have more than enough revenue to accomplish so much, yet we are so good at wasting it.
t1_dui8aic	1	*	I wonder what it would cost to buy Fox News and turn it progressive?
t1_dui42eb	1	*	Except that has not happened at all. You're just complaining about people saying it in a (hypothetical?) situation where you are rich. How does your statement mean anything?
t1_duia7zr	1	*	New tax code fixed that. 
t1_dui6dit	1	*	What's going on is you're talking about something entirely different from him.  You know it, we know it.
t1_duic9c3	1	*	Yep. The issue is not OMG WE NEED TO TAX THEM MORE, the issue is that the loopholes need to be addressed.

t1_dui6ag7	0	*	That's not what he's saying, so it's not redundant.
t1_duib1x3	1	*	It shouldn't come to buying people off to be better people though. That's not really a solution. 
t1_dui8cn1	1	*	They probably don't already anyway.
t1_dui40xe	1	*	That is on income, not capital gains where most of these rich people make their money. 
t1_dui9j6j	1	*	Just do the 9-9-9 plan like creepy Herman Cain wanted. Those Sim City defaults were a good idea.
t1_dui7p6d	1	*	There is nothing stopping rich people from writing gift checks to the government. If Bill feels this way he can open up his pocket book and donate to the IRS. 
t1_duiaju2	1	*	I'm pretty sure he's not a fan of paying to have things change in a democracy.  It just shouldn't be that way.
t1_dui9065	1	*	They can also donate to the Treasury.  Just write a check Bill!
t1_dui19k7	0	*	Interesting that your perspective is they shouldn't have so much rather than everyone should have enough
t1_duia948	0	*	They arent even. Theyre saying we have our billions, now tax everyone else who makes a billion so we stay richer!
t1_duid3oe	0	*	....thn whats stopping you...
t1_dui8frp	0	*	Some houses cost more then 100millions. And to add even if you say that then they would just tie the money up in their company and 100 million is not very much when it comes to super large business
t1_dui9jhy	1	*	Even if some don't even if it's illegal the few that do help but as others have said the tax extra tax money will just go to dumb shit.

t1_duzexjk	1	*	Big Auto planned your collective urban future quite well from what I can tell. If 'well' and 'car dependency' are synonymous. 
t1_duzkfgo	1	*	I think you're talking about cotton and tobacco farms from 200+ years ago. Those weren't in China BTW.

t1_du85ixm	1	*	I'm 99.9% sure this is sarcasm, folks...

t1_dsll95h	1	*	Well said, sir. 
t1_dslde4y	1	*	The fact he is still president is shocking
t1_dslep6d	1	*	That is also true. From my point of view Trump was better choice than Hillary. She is far more capable but evil. Trump is evil but also far less competent.

t1_dute0ch	0	*	I mean, he does, so there's that. I'm not sure if people accidentally put polonium in their own tea.
t1_dutwaie	1	*	More like he is very well known in the west and killing him Right before the election will make it very inconvenient. 
t1_dt0x8hp	1	*	I agree. It's propably not going to be completely horrible.
t1_dskrblc	0	*	Yeah but the claim is that Israel shot at a toddler, not an Israeli person. There's a difference.

t1_dt7b9h7	0	*	trump will have lied walking through the doorway. 
t1_dt7hg5k	1	*	Ill do it.    *doesnt do it*  
t1_dt7r8k3	1	*	It is as impressive as a certified letter.
t1_dt758go	1	*	More likely in private so he can work out a plea bargain.
t1_dt88pbw	1	*	no. the point is our certified stable genius president, wont be able to not lie despite himself for even 15 minutes. it will destory him.
t1_dt7vqw3	1	*	Are Oaths stackable?
t1_dt7el8e	1	*	Trump lies about his lies. I doubt he is sane enough to say 'I don't recall'.
t1_dt7cl99	1	*	I would love if they just called him on stuff like this. Never ask him on anything of substance, just ticky tacky things. 
t1_dt7wv2j	0	*	Yes, but he's also a stable genius.
t1_dt7p35v	1	*	You think he could make it two whole minutes? I doubt he could walk in and sit down before either perjuring himself or accidentally (and proudly) confessing something treasonable.
t1_dt8k7sz	1	*	Dude he cant even agree to speak to him under oath without lying, since his lawyers immediately said he wont do so. Its crazy.

t1_dtkf0b0	1	*	Other articles have sound.   And saying it mimicks human speach is a huge stretch.   It makes noises in response but they sound nothing like human speach.
t1_dta058f	1	*	i was saying boourns
t1_dtb0x5z	1	*	And even if he was booed, what does that prove?  That there are (shocker) people who hate his guts and will screech until the world knows it?
t1_dta0qma	1	*	Might as well. That wouldn't be inaccurate.
t1_dt9v4gm	0	*	Erm, a lot of media questioned the basis for this decision?
t1_dtaeoa7	1	*	More like a hiss. They were polite.
t1_dtat6zn	0	*	This was part of a Q&A after the speech. Why the media insists on giving Trump ammo for his media attacks I will never understand.

t1_dt8f4kf	1	*	Either a bad joke or you're an asshole.
t1_dt899kd	1	*	Sorry bud, one less shade of grey.

t1_dtzd3dk	1	*	Seems like Germany is the enemy of free speech. 
t1_dsker2o	1	*	Wew lad. Being impeached doesn't mean you are removed from office. Do you think GWB was Clintons VP?
t1_dskdjix	1	*	Clinton lost his job because his second term ended. Al Gore was never President.
t1_dskck47	1	*	That's a tu quo que fallacy. 
t1_duwxkcz	1	*	Because it's not.  Now, let me jabber t you for 5minutes about your white privilege and how you should accept that you are a lesser human being for being white. /s
t1_duwtr15	1	*	Because most people aren't going to vote based on just this one thing? There are a lot of political issues out there that actually have huge effects on people's lives, unlike this.
t1_duww5x2	1	*	> How any ~~white~~ sane person can vote labour after all this shit is beyond me.  If a party hires a racist without any intellect as an advisor, maybe they aren't worth being voted for.

t1_dsgloa2	1	*	Really? The pitchforks were out for Obama over this. It was a major issue. Liberals felt betrayed. Guys like you were bellowing at the top of your lungs about how Obama was a corporate shill.

t1_dsehaln	1	*	And also relying on a guy known to love dick measuring contests to back off after being struck first.   If we hit North Korea, Seul and its 24 million residents will be leveled within a day. 
t1_dse63rx	0	*	You know. If we are in a nuclear war I can honestly say I am probably not going to care much about Trump.   Or anything...
t1_dse4bxp	1	*	A strike would be terrible, there's no other possible outcome.  That's why this has been playing out for 70 years.

t1_dul445g	1	*	I enjoyed my world religion class. It was essentially a material history-based beginners' philosophy and cultural anthropology class for many liberal arts-oriented students like me.

t1_dulc2jg	1	*	Mine was solely for doing homework.

t1_duma0zh	1	*	I went to a catholic school in Scotland, I am not religious in the slightest but I loved RE. Learning about other religions and where they came from was so interesting as a kid.

t1_dulmhlw	1	*	Isnt this heavily dependant on the teacher?
t1_dul9i02	1	*	I went to a Jesuit run school and throughout 1st-6th year we never studied any religion other than Catholicism, there was plenty of classes on morality though 
t1_dulaq48	1	*	Thoughts and prayers....no wait, shit what do I send now?
t1_dulejzl	1	*	In my country it's one foreign language in primary school and two foreign languages in middle and high school. I think it's an alright system.
t1_dulbl29	1	*	That's basically what they learn in religion class though
t1_dulk89k	1	*	This is interesting. Back in my secondary school days religion classes were purely catholic driven. My parents allowed me to skip it. So did the school. I'm polish. 
t1_dulfuj3	1	*	Father Murphy, what are you doing here?! 
t1_dulbsuq	1	*	Thank God (...) for that. I was stuck with religious indoctrination when I started high school. Terrible for morale. This is what R.E. is meant to be about.
t1_dul9gr6	1	*	That's what my religious class was, mixed in with some philosophy, moral/ ethical discussions and critical thinking. Had it up until I was 16.

t1_dsd94qk	0	*	How exactly is that related to Merkel at all? The Turks have been in Germany for half a century.
t1_dselrq5	1	*	It's not clear that the Turkish government is involved. To be honest, it would be quite dumb of them. He's not a very famous football player and it could have been essier to kill him in Turkey. 
t1_dsdtu4s	1	*	It's just a coup, Bro!

t1_dswc754	1	*	Most sports have had to add testing to all major events. I'm surprised track and field isn't one of them.
t1_dsw5hst	1	*	Pretty sure that the 15 year old mormon girl from my middle school competing in archery wasn't using either of those.
t1_dswfdku	1	*	Because nearly every athlete at the Olympic level is doping if it benefits them. It's the reality that nobody wants to admit. 
t1_dswh444	1	*	How about it's not even random, Russians always get tested. Every time. If there is such a problem with it (doping) then it should deter it.
t1_dswftez	0	*	I am sure you are living a very unhappy life with a lot of negativity. Goodluck with it.

t1_dssluk2	0	*	Well he did win the election. 
t1_dsmgc1v	1	*	That depends on whether they're restoring destroyed forests or planting new ones. Planting new ones can negatively affect the grassland ecosystem which is a major carbon sink.
t1_dsm1umo	1	*	Just for perspective, China is about 113 times the size of the island of Ireland. Ireland is about 1/2 the size of the mean size of each of the United States.

t1_dsrfimc	1	*	Much like the Olympics.
t1_dsrczy4	1	*	This isn't a pissing contest. This is China trying to stop industry from putting their citizenry in a perpetual dutch oven of pollution. 
t1_dsr3a0n	1	*	Eh in a perfect world. There are just so many factors that don't involve fossil fuel use in developed countries, such as developing countries contributing to a ton of pollution and the meat industry
t1_dsrp536	1	*	How comes everything built by China can be viewed from space? /S
t1_dsr5116	1	*	I read that a possible consequence of ongoing pollution will be declining levels of oxygen in the atmosphere. This means that humans will slowly choke to death.

t1_dua1qdf	0	*	The problem is that Monsanto is going to swoop in and sue everybody who bought the seeds

t1_duv1uty	1	*	Extrajudicial killing will officially make the US a third world shithole.
t1_duvb3qq	1	*	To be fair, I wouldn't do drugs if I knew it'd get me shot and killed.   Sometimes ruling with an iron fist works despite it being absolutely horrendously cruel. 
t1_duv0svg	1	*	Yeah, I meant I hate Trump but thank god he doesn't do that.  
t1_duwgs1b	1	*	The thing is many of the murdered are merely users or maybe small time dealers. Or simply have nothing to do with drugs at all.

t1_duuuobg	0	*	You're missing the constitutional right to due process.
t1_duvqbu1	1	*	Yes, they have a huge drug problem. Duterte has arguably made it alot worse because he's killed about 20,000 people with no trials, not all of whom were even involved in the drug trade. 
t1_duvb96v	1	*	And Trump himself is likely an amphetamine addict.

t1_duv1ttg	0	*	Was it actually safer or did you simply perceive t as safer? How many people were being killed each month before the extrajudicial killings started as opposed to after?
t1_duv17ch	1	*	They also kill journalists, dissidents, and political opponents.  Trump is in man-love
t1_duvpr83	1	*	No, you're thinking of Putin.

t1_duuxwr0	1	*	Well that's fine with the US because they have a killing problem already so that would be one less problem overall /sarcasm
t1_duv0iry	1	*	I think the fact that he's a sociopath is a bigger problem.  Given that, it might be better that he's an idiot as really smart sociopaths are the most dangerous (e.g. Putin).
t1_duuye59	1	*	Filipinos still have a drug problem and an added killing problem.
t1_duvp0sc	1	*	As if Drumpf has ever preoccupied himself with something as trivial as hypocrisy. He probably just likes the idea of using GUNS to resolve the opioid epidemic.
t1_duuv2gs	1	*	I think Pharma is more the equivalent of Duterte's son. He's killing off competition, not so much the drugs themselves.  
t1_duuy89q	0	*	Ouch. That was a good one, but ouch. 
t1_duuy2in	1	*	He probably does, hell... Trump acts like a coke addict... 
t1_duuzqig	0	*	I mean does it count as death by drugs if you get shot in the head
t1_duv5l03	1	*	Politicians and lobbyists happen to be the highest ranking drug dealers in the world, sometimes in more ways that one...
t1_duv0q05	1	*	Trump himself is a sniff sniff sniff addict. 
t1_duv0hs2	1	*	Trump is also rumored to be a prescription meth addict, most definitely in the past and possibly currently.
t1_duvtxcs	0	*	Does the same apply to guns?
t1_duv29xk	0	*	Due to drugs being illegal. I think I see an obvious solution.

t1_ds6751m	1	*	You just described capitalism as a whole.
t1_ds5u5gp	1	*	Thing is they never promised anything and I think those are what they were calling the best possible scenario numbers very unlikely to be met. So basically what they predicted has happened.

t1_ds66tem	1	*	They are currently producing about 4000 per month so about a fifth of what Musk said.
t1_ds5zifh	1	*	Just setting expectations and being consistent. 
t1_ds66m8e	1	*	I doubt they crowdfinanced their production line.
t1_ds64fr5	1	*	They sure will...as long as the government keeps shoving money in Elon's wallet.
t1_ds64m7h	1	*	> They will survive.  Eventually theyll run out of other people money.
t1_ds640he	1	*	You'd think they know that too when they are developing and releasing their production goals.
t1_ds661x4	1	*	> Tesla has missed every deadline and expectation they ever set for the company...ever.  Except the battery in South Australia
t1_ds5wxyc	1	*	I wonder why he thought that, and what went wrong.
t1_ds60ph5	0	*	Such a underrated comment! This is how entrepreneurial investing works, as long as you have a religious like fanboy appeal then fuck reality and promised deliverables.  
t1_ds64zf5	1	*	It is rather sad how he used Tesla shareholders to bail himself out of his terrible Solar City investment.
t1_ds65men	1	*	Agreed.  Tesla has been making cars for like 12 years now and they are always a bit behind what Elon says.  They also deliver.
t1_ds64ncp	1	*	Wheres the credibility? 
t1_ds67ln3	1	*	not everything is a conspiracy my friendo

t1_ds9izjv	0	*	Youre kidding, right? China does the same thing. They just do it passively at all times by monitoring networks and tracking everything. 
t1_ds9iwzg	1	*	> didn't see any numbers on hits.  Why would they advertise their failures?

t1_dsaezy1	1	*	Why? If the CBP asks to see my phone I just say yes. I travel to canada once a week for work, has yet to ever happen, but literally nothing to hide.

t1_du5cjrc	1	*	Just like tulips.

t1_du41xn0	1	*	> no inherent value  The price of fuel?
t1_du4wjug	0	*	Why? It's providing a subsidy for generating clean energy, in this case geothermal energy, why is that bad?
t1_du4611w	0	*	Great idea. But you wouldn't make $$$, you'd just get free heat all winter.
t1_du4fjnt	1	*	Not quite but I dont think bitcoin is the future. Cryptocurrency definitely is the future though.

t1_dunhupk	0	*	Ex troll who quit after two months. You should really read full articles and not headlines. 
t1_dun1bxr	0	*	I thought that's all it was from the start? It's all so stupid. Donald trump won, I wish they'd get over it.

t1_dun9wxe	0	*	I love how you think this is over  Also, what's the weather like in St. Petersburg today?
t1_dumz6gh	1	*	Highly unlikely and this particular case wouldn't sway that either way. If Mueller finishes before the midterms I would be surprised.
t1_dun9tx7	0	*	Don't doubt that they also use 'bots, though, given some of the cut-and-paste spammy nature of a lot of the activity
t1_dun7xpq	1	*	As a russian, I read almost everything in a russian accent, so you are not the only one.:)

t1_dumkreg	0	*	I wish I knew how to do remind me in times like this :(
t1_dun4og1	1	*	Yeah, it's like a plague. Ten trolls may start this and 100 people will spread it further. So after some time, it's hard to tell who is kremlebot and who is normal internet user. 
t1_dun2uab	0	*	We are legion. 
t1_dunti0x	1	*	Or maybe feed them when they're working for you.   Lest they troll you. 
t1_dun5ras	1	*	Not just them. Remember all of the Bernie spam during the primaries? The Russians have allegedly been behind the grassroots support for him.
t1_dun21ag	1	*	Trivial to get around a block like that

t1_dun709v	1	*	You're entitled to your own opinions, but not your own facts
t1_dumyho9	1	*	They never understood critical thinking.  They were defenseless.
t1_dumywck	1	*	No one knows what the word meme means anymore either.
t1_dumyhaa	1	*	I'm honestly pretty okay with the changing definition.  The connotation that the phrase is gaining more clearly emphasizes that trolls are asswipes.
t1_dun1s4d	1	*	The one Barry Allen fucked up.

t1_duclk52	1	*	The article is about UK supermarkets. Where do you think that the UK is?

t1_dsmzfjx	1	*	There arent any left to be frustrated. Theyre dropping like flies and not being replaced since basic competency offends Trump. He hates it when everyone in the room is smarter than he could ever be.
t1_dsmy8qu	1	*	At least the Europeans are less timid about calling them on their bullshit until they admit it. hopefully that'll raise the quality over time. 
t1_dsnt7tj	1	*	Don't know what r/worldnews would say,   But I'll gladly call you a gullible, Xenophobic fool for believing easily disproven right-wing lies

t1_dsnov4w	0	*	You dont realize he must have been talking about malmo sweden, or Paris, or Berlin Germany or acid attacks in London. Its easy for fake news to edit interviews to pander to their  narrative.

t1_dsnu99w	1	*	That deserved a standing ovation!

t1_dsx7n5q	1	*	The one mighty Iron Curtain is now the flappable Irony Curtain.

t1_duaqbsj	1	*	This! Trump may actually believe it.
t1_duapbji	0	*	I'm not a Moscow resident, but I assumed this regardless. BBC and Reddit are both vehicles for anti-Putin propaganda.
t1_duas1az	1	*	It's a smart thing to do. You don't want to mention your opponents by name because it's free press. During the election Trump got a huge amount of free press from his opponents

t1_dtjpmgs	1	*	U put a lot of effort into that. *claps*
t1_dtkq2f7	0	*	 The US is racist,  you're right.  It's why there's affirmative action programs and such to help minorities.  Obviously such things come about in a racist country. 
t1_dtjsk10	1	*	Is the statement made in this article wrong?  Or is everyone going to whatabout until the next country calls Trump a racist?
t1_dtj51i5	0	*	This headline will make it to the #3 spot, at least.

t1_dst87ww	0	*	I think the point is to highlight the absurdity of punishing victims of sex trafficking who are trying to rebuild their lives.  Legalizing prostitution doesn't help sex slaves and victims of abuse.

t1_dsryecn	1	*	Theyre not insane. Its perfectly rational to blow yourself up if your religion tells you to. They do it because of their islamic faith, not some mental illness. 
t1_dsru6ye	0	*	This is just the latest in a very long line of Muslim leaders condemning terrorism.

t1_dsaj0rb	1	*	The O in H2O is bonded to hydrogen and not useable for breathing. The oxygen this is talking about is essentially dissolved into the water similarly to how salt or sugar dissolve.

t1_dsfltd4	1	*	Probably there plan. I recall China saying something like whoever starts the war, they'll be enemies with. So they might be trying to get Trump to start a war or something 
t1_dsffl3x	1	*	This is it. Their familys are probably held in camps. No wonder NK does well their lives depend on it.
t1_dsfmaid	1	*	Deescalation. Thats the goal. And relevant to the current political climate this is a step toward peace. But thats because weve taken 6 steps back over the past year or so.
t1_dsfnd86	1	*	He demonstrated that he was more likely to get S Korea killed than protect it. This scared S Korea into kissing N Koreas ass. 
t1_dsfhkxa	1	*	Hello front Pyongyang! Yup, feeling pretty good about it.   /s
t1_dsfemhx	1	*	Good thing Lindsey Graham is head of the United States Olympic Committee /s
t1_dsfhzj1	1	*	I mean, id think theyd properly feed olympians in the making
t1_dsfzmrr	1	*	A medal. You really think he won't win all three in every event?
t1_dsfmtkx	1	*	>Oh good, the country with camps equal or worse to the Nazi camps are now in the Olympics   Is the scale really similar?  I genuinely have no idea.
t1_dsg6qu9	1	*	I bet he coach the basketball team himself.
t1_dsfh1dv	1	*	Is it really good news? I mean Kim still starves and kills his people at will doesn't he? 
t1_dsffheq	1	*	It's the location that makes this a news story.  30 years after they boycotted the 1988 Olympics because of the location in South Korea, they're willing to go to this one.  It's a tiny baby step.
t1_dsfms59	1	*	Because theyve lost faith in the USs ability to protect them. 
t1_dsfs2fc	1	*	Whatever the outcome of the games. North Korea probably broadcasts that they won all the gold medals.
t1_dsfuu70	1	*	This wasn't the goal at all. It was basically the first thing they agreed on, it was a given.
t1_dsg0ug1	1	*	Imagine how bad the US government is fucking up that the South managed to calm down the North.   Fuck Trump and fuck his cronies in government. 
t1_dsfts7i	1	*	this deserves a gold, just like kim

t1_dsf7for	0	*	I choo-choo-choose peace! 
t1_dsfvtwq	1	*	You still got the women's category
t1_dsfga92	1	*	They've competed in many Olympic Games. Everyone was surprised by their soccer team doing well against...iirc Spain or Portugal? Then Portugal maybe stomped them in the next round 
t1_dsfkbm0	1	*	[He's too damn fast!](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/06/trump-north-south-korea-talks-olympics)
t1_dsfur9k	1	*	You have a very good point there. I definitely never considered the matter that way.
t1_dsfw8d7	1	*	I hope he doesnt murder the families and people competing if they don't win any medals.
t1_dsffito	1	*	I thought NK had their own fake Olympics with hookers and beer water
t1_dsfauxd	0	*	Not for their families 
t1_dsfwzbm	1	*	A gold medal in mental gymnastics 
t1_dsg0u7s	1	*	I've a feeling some of the NK athletes are going to be taking several hundred steps very quickly in the right direction. 
t1_dsgbi1c	1	*	I have a question, what about calming his ire against his own citizens?
t1_dsfskwq	1	*	The problem is that if you withhold nutritious food long enough, they start cannibalizing the lesser athletes. 
t1_dsfcwu2	1	*	That guy is a real fuck boi if you ask me. 
t1_dsft9xm	1	*	On the news back home NK won't win one gold, they will win ALL the golds.
t1_dsfrc8p	1	*	They are groomed and provided for from a young age for the sake of national pride i would say
t1_dsflfn8	1	*	Well, trump is bad...
t1_dsfmwgm	1	*	No. Trump is why the US isn't playing a role in Korean talks. 
t1_dsgc4ze	1	*	Yes, if only every Dictator got Nuclear weapons the world would be a better place
t1_dsgf5z1	1	*	Less North Korea, more Bitcoin!
t1_dsffppo	0	*	Stop using Google's russian-english translator, tovarish.
t1_dsfn05g	1	*	This one is in SK dude
t1_dsfkqn4	1	*	If Im not mistaken, the shortest and lightest  athlete at the last Olympics was North Korean. 
t1_dsfgqxk	1	*	Allegedly, when a North Korean travels abroad their family is held hostage back home to ensure no one defects. 
t1_dsfh2m5	1	*	I wanna play too!!! Wahhh!
t1_dsfcrkw	1	*	No, that honor belongs to Dennis Rodman. Man is a diplomatic genius. Most stable.
t1_dsfdx1z	0	*	Kim Dae Jung (98-03) went to Pyeongyang and met with Kim Jung Il (Jung-un's dad)
t1_dsfzltb	1	*	Yea you know, because there's no way North Korea could be scared by threats from a batshit crazy man with the ability to wipe them off the face of the earth with the push of a button. 
t1_dsfdz6d	1	*	Probably not many if it's anything like the 2016 Olympics as they had armed guards escort them everywhere.
t1_dsfpnsp	1	*	What a unique situation. South koreans want peace. The U.S 8000 miles away wants war.  Weird stuff.
t1_dsftz19	1	*	The fact that this year it's taking place in SK and they're still being allowed by the government to participate is pretty significant
t1_dsfj26c	0	*	I have a feeling Kim Jong is highly educated and knows the US is fully capable of eliminating him and his regime no matter what rhetoric he spews.
t1_dsfvm3c	1	*	Now I just want to see a version of the olympics where all the olympians are world leaders. 
t1_dsfs8i0	1	*	Not fantastic news for the North Korean athletes, all of whom will be tortured or executed unless they win gold medals. Which
t1_dsfmuiu	1	*	The DPRK is a peaceful state
t1_dsffzqp	0	*	Back in the beginnings of the olympics, they would put wars on pause to compete and watch the olympics. Thats how much respect the founders had for the games.
t1_dsfmbxc	1	*	As much as I dislike the man, he might be right. Kim may have recognized Trump as somebody who's crazier than he is, and doesn't actually want his country turned into radioactive glass. 
t1_dsfirqy	1	*	#thankstrump
t1_dsfymoy	1	*	What if this is just a strategy from the North to convince everybody that North Korea will be calm while their delegation is in the South and then drop a bomb nevertheless when nobody suspects it?
t1_dsfj6oq	1	*	You're everywhere wtf.
t1_dsflvgp	1	*	And our president is threatening to turn their country to glass. 
t1_dsgtzdz	1	*	The South Korean President already have him credit.
t1_dsfrtab	1	*	Laughed out loud at Flame Broiler. Thanks.
t1_dsffnig	1	*	but now they'll just abuse the shit out of their athletes to make them as strong, fast, etc.. as they can. Who knows what will even happen to their families if they lose.
t1_dsfjv93	1	*	How long do you think it will be before Trump takes credit for this because of his tweet about his more bigly button?
t1_dsflrq2	1	*	I'll take that bet, and counter with 1000 bucks says Trump tries to keep the US out of the Olympics citing 'security concerns' because of this. 
t1_dsg1pq4	1	*	Funny, they were only playing the South Korean anthem while marching.
t1_dsg3kar	1	*	He would do for gold medals what Bruce Dickinson did for gold records
t1_dsfh1i5	1	*	Arent you afraid Kim Jong Un will win all the gold medals?
t1_dt951hz	0	*	Cool
t1_dt7p1dw	0	*	David Cameron is part of the left now?  Jesus, you have no idea what you're talking about, do you.

t1_du698jn	1	*	And an episode of X Files
t1_ds4hvp5	1	*	The scandal concerned young police students. If it has bigger implications it might mean that in a few years trust will sink but police officers today are great on average.

t1_ds4g0qi	0	*	The people who call them fascists are obviously idiots.

t1_dt4iy7z	1	*	Very likely after this news.
t1_dt512q9	1	*	That would be a 'poacher' not a hunter.   If there's no open season on  it and someone decides to shoot it that makes them a poacher.
t1_dt5osay	1	*	They don't.  They prefer to avoid Apex predators like bears and humans.  They will walk by you and not bother you unless they have rabies.
t1_dt5mjd7	1	*	Can it cast spells? 
t1_dt4cuyi	0	*	> They have an important place in our eco system.  They had, they don't have it anymore. They haven't been part of it for what? 100 Years?

t1_dsycs7q	1	*	It's too bad the airline has developed such a reputation.  It's actually a really nice airline to fly.  I flew on them last year from Taipei to KL and it was a pleasant flight.
t1_dt7wz36	1	*	Laziest form of journalism.
t1_ds4xs3o	1	*	It could also excuse Hamas, because they aren't the aggressors.  Either way, if it was in fact Hamas and they cared about the credit, they can always claim it.
t1_dt2xwtn	0	*	Should I report my co-workers to HR who do the Queens Trump accent?  Since they obviously are bigoted towards New Yorkers from Queens.

t1_dt2xn3l	1	*	Gives them a common enemy.  Genius!
t1_dt2l5ht	1	*	It's almost as if the President of the US should be held to a different standard than a comedic television show. Ridiculous concept, eh?
t1_dt3gyly	1	*	Same with North and South Korea.  They realize hes crazy and dangerous, so they need to work together.  Theyre set to march under one flag at the upcoming Olympics.
t1_dt2yg1x	0	*	That's not how commas work.

t1_dt2yjy4	1	*	Yeah. An orange orangutan with a limited vocabulary at that.

t1_dt3lrft	1	*	do you know how many people make fun of Melania's accent..? Alot. I agree though, nobody should be made of for their accent, yet northerners make fun of southerners and vice versa every day.
t1_dt2zcrz	1	*	Why are you assuming he was making fun of the Indian PM?
t1_dt39bb1	1	*	>Humble beginnings  *massacres 2000 Muslims in Gujurat*  The US even banned him from entering because of that. 
t1_dt2u9tk	0	*	Then you're gonna love the imitation my asshole does of Trump's mouth.
t1_dt3dlrq	1	*	oh, so when I talk ghetto when I imitate people getting shot, that's not racism, that's just funny. ok. go it.
t1_dt33ln9	0	*	1mil to start a business might not go as far as you think. 
t1_dt2zyw7	1	*	Speaking with an accent can fool people into thinking you know more languages.
t1_dt2zdmt	1	*	Its mocking... Of course you don't need to do an impersonation of anyone you quote.
t1_dt2xah1	1	*	Truly an Idiocracy moment.
t1_dt2yurt	1	*	well if you look at this behavior from the perspective of a childish, racist prick - then it's easy to understand #datsOurPresident
t1_dt30nul	1	*	I mean, in his case it's entirely deserved so I can give it a pass. 
t1_dt30ows	1	*	Lol now thats funny and true
t1_dt35yn8	1	*	You mean a microwave? 
t1_dt32as6	1	*	Of course not 
t1_dt2zhgn	1	*	Yup, we all do stupid shit, but when you're the president of the USA, you kinda have to reign that stuff in, or lose everybody's respect. The president is, and should be, held to a higher standard.
t1_dt5l8kw	1	*	Oh, yeah man. Open that conversation door so the gene superiority advocates can have a writing prompt!
t1_dt3tm7g	1	*	gold

t1_dshdjp1	1	*	I mean to be fair the picture doesn't help distinguish much
t1_dshbxr4	1	*	Hashtag metoo wasn't just about celebrities. It was about everyone on Facebook who feels they have been slighted in some way, somehow related to their gender. 
t1_dtgnzc4	0	*	I feel like world war 3 has already started. It's never really until a world war is over do history books give it a starting date.

t1_dtcx5jk	1	*	I guess crayola really does rock.
t1_dst1bjv	1	*	Lol at you defending warmonger third world nations. The US can do whatever it wants because only it has authority in the region. China needs to crawl back into its hole.  ^^^/s
t1_dsumyb6	1	*	This is not true; some animals do not have the neural development to experience pain the way you experience pain, For example: sponges, some jellyfish, etc. 
t1_dsua5ug	1	*	Plants do not have a nervous system. Their reactions to damage are localised and biochemical.
t1_du076o0	1	*	I always imagine it the other way around.  Imagine if Syrian airplanes dropped bombs on the army in California.

t1_du5jhzt	1	*	This needs more upvotes
t1_dui9mm3	1	*	I think AFD is much more fiscally conservative  than Front National, from what I've read. FN is basically straight up populist/communitarian whereas AFD is more of a true right wing party.

t1_dtw377b	1	*	Let's ask ourselves, now why would these countries take these loans if they couldn't get something out of it? Are these countries really that stupid that they would fall into the hands of the Chinese?

t1_dshavax	1	*	> wth was he thinking  I assume he was thinking he could undercut the sales of the book. That way Trump could say the book was a failure.

t1_dsh3okn	1	*	I feel like this is often overlooked.
t1_dshnr7h	1	*	I was fine with him until he screwed with our elections. Now I can't wait until hes locked in a dark room for the rest of his life.
t1_dshwi0z	1	*	His best defence is how many people are watching. If anything it would be a hanging or a robbery.
t1_dsi255o	1	*	Do you dare suggest that it's less than excellent journalism to reproduce three 3 presumptuous hate tweets and entirely neglect to mention that the UN declares his detention arbitrary and unlawful?
t1_dshdx9r	0	*	Everyone I don't like is Russian!  Fuck me Americans are so easily indoctrinated, the man revealed blatant U.S. war crimes and apparently that makes *him* the bad guy
t1_dscndo0	0	*	Do you understand how averages work?
t1_dscn7l2	0	*	Well research suggest that people who use marijuana most often tend to use harder drugs over time. So that is why they are going after  marijuana.
t1_dscnfz2	1	*	Probably nothing, as it would be a medical issue and not a choice.  Edit: Not defending the school. I think the rule is stupid.

t1_dtbggjh	1	*	You sick bastard, the friendly people at /r/gilf don't want that kind of smut.   Edit: Fuck you autocorrect, I want gilf not golf.
t1_dtbevy8	0	*	The naughtiest thing Theresa ever did was run through the wheat fields.  She's draconian and doesn't understand how the internet works.
t1_dsohfj8	0	*	It sounds like the jewish Ghettos in wwII
t1_dsold8q	1	*	The thing is: a tunnel which terminates inside of Israel, in some field, would have a very hard time to function as a smuggling tunnel, as opposed to one which terminates inside of Egyptian Rafah.

t1_dto3b6e	0	*	As a South Korean, I will say this. My country sold weapons to Iran AND Iraq ... during the Iran-Iraq war. North Korea can't even begin to be this business savvy.
t1_dtol8hq	0	*	Didn't both EU, US (and presumably Russia) sell weapons to fuel that conflict too? This is calling them on bullshit we commit ourselves. It's a moot point.

t1_dv3zjw5	0	*	Laws aren't enforced retroactively.
t1_dv61cyt	1	*	No, the proposed law is *under* 15 yo. So if it had happened in France  1. It would not be illegal under the future law.   2. This law didn't exist back then (or yet)
t1_dv5kqgu	1	*	If it didn't you'd have two kids in prison for raping each other. 
t1_dv479zf	0	*	Are you trying to suggest that it is normal for a 15 year old to date an 11 year old? Christ that's fucked up.

t1_dsm05uf	1	*	You wouldn't need to cool the systems during winter. Lowering the energy costs.  Probably.
t1_dsv6tp8	0	*	There's a reason why the growth rate for 2018 is slated to be 6.4% or lower. They're trying more to focus on sustainable growth than high growth
t1_dsvj9vm	1	*	Well its more complicated than just a number. There is private debt, public debt, and government debt. It is also important what form of debt it is.

t1_dute1w8	1	*	In this case, probably less a full term.
t1_duul34p	0	*	Don't forget the new spy department. We will back to Ming, even worse, at least Ming was running under minister.
t1_dut2jdf	1	*	Well the currently ruling regime has always been authoritarian, Russia has always been authoritarian. So we aren't seeing anything different other than history repeating itself 
t1_dutnfop	1	*	They've been a dictatorship since 2000 years ago

t1_duswtk1	0	*	Oh yes!

t1_dut1mky	1	*	Xi has the high ground

t1_dut392c	0	*	If he does become a dictator, which I doubt, I wouldn't be shocked if the U.S. government adds him to the list of dictatorial regimes they'll support.
t1_dusvoos	1	*	First he came for the personal enshrinement. Then he came for the freedom of speech.  Finally he came for the constitution. 
t1_duwc3y0	1	*	Guess they don't care Chinese peoples feeling. but they care western people
t1_dut2jqh	1	*	Now's probably a good time to take up horse back riding

t1_dusy90u	1	*	We have yet to see how Trumpaloompa feels about abdication, wether it is premature or not.  You might come home to a similar situation.  
t1_dutvm1h	1	*	Inb4 Trump makes a Tweet about how China is doing it right and we should follow their lead. 
t1_dxtcied	1	*	I keep seeing these statistics in the US that most Chinese support Xi Jinping.  Are they making up these polls in China or something?

t1_dut1726	1	*	But what happens when you get an incompetent leader and the limit on presidential term has already been abolished. You'll be stuck with an incompetent leader.

t1_dv21db6	1	*	I dont know if thats so true. Doesnt the Church pay for their entire livelihood (food, clothing, residence, etc)? I bet many feel locked in, especially those without secular education.

t1_dsk9xe2	1	*	Why would Trump quote me? 
t1_dskaubj	1	*	Which means   erect penis  given his interest in sports it wouldn't surprise me if he shows an interest in buying arsenal
t1_dsk8mn6	1	*	Trump will be gone by then.
t1_dsk9hi0	1	*	Nope
t1_dskcqjj	1	*	Was he a ranger at a national park?

t1_dskb2iy	1	*	Sigh... The ducking people whom voted for his ass...
t1_dskek5v	1	*	Trump is such a queen...
t1_dsl1zip	1	*	Why would she meet him. The queen may not be Diana's biggest fan but Will and Harry have a say in taking to a man who insulted her. 
t1_dskij3s	1	*	I keep seeing this he isn't welcome here from Americans.  But he's the president. So clearly he is welcome enough.
t1_dskcbnr	0	*	London maybe but unfortunatly he does have support.
t1_dskgvtq	1	*	London is literally a no-go Zone!  Politicians burnt in the streets, massive gun problem. #Sad!

t1_dsk80az	1	*	I mean Trump himself tweeted about it saying that he is canceling his trip because of Obama lmao whats little bitch 
t1_dsk3xq6	1	*	Hes not welcome in the US IMO. 
t1_dskbv5m	1	*	I think people did want him to come so they can welcome him by showing him their bums. That's disapproval and retaining class. I mean, lower class maybe, but still, that's a type of class, right? 
t1_dsk7hvg	1	*	This made me laugh and feel sad at the same time. Am American....
t1_dskib8z	1	*	Yes he is and also what a petty reason.
t1_dskdqnp	1	*	I am sad that he didn't get the chance to ride in the ceremonial carriage while 50,000 Londoners turn their backs to him as he goes past.

t1_dskepjn	1	*	Impressive... Every word in that sentence was wrong.
t1_dsk9q1v	1	*	Not even remotely. I'm a Brit who chose to live in the US and I LOVE it here! I have an amazing group of friends and a great life.  I just wish the native drivers were a bit better... ><

t1_dskhvw5	1	*	He's a child.
t1_dskakbp	0	*	Not American. So forgive my stupid question....but after this term could Obama run for president again? Or do you guys have a two term tenure and that's it? Cause we sure liked Obama. 
t1_dskfgba	1	*	There have been polls in the UK as to Trumps popularity, hes very unpopular  https://yougov.co.uk/opi/browse/Donald_Trump
t1_dskg4oc	1	*	It's not even a stretch though. A man with as big an ego as Trump wouldn't want to go to the UK(or EU) because they hate him there. The guy can't handle criticism without moaning on Twitter about it.

t1_ds48cns	1	*	So weird  Its like the worlds climate is changing or something 
t1_ds3hasz	1	*	How do you figure that?
t1_ds49ekz	1	*	It depends on the strength of the El Nixf1o event. It can be as high as several tenths of a degree Celsius worldwide.
t1_ds497da	1	*	Even with unusually cold temperatures in much of the U.S. the earth is still overall much warmer than average right now.
t1_ds3i0ct	0	*	Just because the POTUS doesn't know the difference between climate and weather, doesn't mean you should stay ignorant of it yourself.   
t1_ds4uxco	1	*	Lots more people moving up to Canada suddenly.
t1_ds45uvz	1	*	Without a strong jet stream to hold polar air near the pole, what happens in the Arctic no longer stays in the Arctic.
t1_ds3ijuv	1	*	They should say climate change instead of global warming so that's on them. In regards to your comment, climate is usually 30 years of data while weather is short term atmospheric behavior.
t1_dt5bykh	1	*	Wouldn't that be perfect, making the commuter pay for something that wasn't our fault.
t1_dt5xiun	1	*	I donno man, I think it's just the Wynne government making excuses on the shitty transit system we have here

t1_dtpt6go	1	*	What do you expect everyone to do? Taken down Putin?
t1_dtp883o	1	*	Yeah, he's putin on the hits! 
t1_dtpfbvp	1	*	*Have you ever wondered why the murder rate is so low, and the accident rate is so high?*
t1_dtp2fyp	1	*	perhaps he ingested polonium while falling out an upper story window during a hunting accident
t1_dtoyy1d	1	*	His job is staying in power, so murdering his opponents is part of the job.
t1_dtp879t	1	*	Let me help you correct your typo, you mean Trumps.
t1_dtq6gpy	1	*	Must be why he was wearing that hard hat in the news photo.

t1_dtc4za7	1	*	Dumb redditors being dumb. Nothing surprising tbh
t1_dtbxzs3	1	*	P.s. its awful news. Any loss of innocent life should be sympathized with my any human who is capable of empathy. 
t1_dtcblsl	1	*	Deadliest attack, in Afghanistan history, is the U.S.A, bombing the shit out of multiple cities. Over the petrodollar. 
t1_dtcaq50	1	*	So enpty
t1_dtcckt2	1	*	AFAIK, it's only a war crime if you're part of a recognized military(according to Geneva Conventions standards). The Taliban do not fall under those standards.
t1_dtc6zjp	0	*	IKR everytime I turn around white supremist everywhere hiding in the shadows waiting to be racist.

t1_dtbtrey	1	*	Blast wave or the position the way the car was placed. It could've been that they parked it where there's a busy walk away.
t1_dtc4vty	1	*	Country doesnt hold the same meaning to all people who happen to live in geographic proximity. Especially in a part of the world that is still deeply entrenched in some tribal cultural ways.  
t1_dtbvbr9	0	*	**So far this year**  Sounds so grim to be expecting something so terrible to happen again to innocent people. I feel terrible for everyone living there.
t1_dtcdcu7	1	*	A million people die every day.
t1_dtbuqo3	1	*	They are Pashtuns. Plus, they run a shadow government. Most farmers want to be left alone. So, they pick who is most likely to protect them. They don't have a national identity. 
t1_dtc22iw	1	*	So Afghanistan wasn't predominantly Muslim in the 60s or they just weren't radicalized Muslims?
t1_dtbvv23	0	*	Don't give up on it. Everything terrible will eventually end. 
t1_dtbximn	1	*	All religion is shit IMO
t1_dtbxlci	1	*	Few of the Nazi's were undercover Jews out of fear. Fear makes people do wild things.
t1_dtck8h2	1	*	Which is why the Taliban is actually unpopular in Afghanistan. Taliban is a means of control over Afghanistan by Pakistan.
t1_dtbxi3v	1	*	No, just another day in afganistant since the Americans came in and fucked it all up. Was peaceful before. 
t1_dtc67r0	1	*	They bomb their own people in the name of allah ...
t1_dtbv8s6	0	*	That's an insult to the people who passed away. They didn't set off the car bomb that killed them. The only thing worse than garbage is the person who committed this act. 
t1_dtchjsy	1	*	And just like that kids, terrorism finally came to an end. 
t1_dtc6s63	1	*	If only the military were as edgy as you 
t1_dtc0sgo	1	*	Shoot. My dad is headed to Kabul in a few weeks. Not allowed to travel by ground anymore so hell be in a helicopter. Idk how much safer that sounds

t1_dtbz691	1	*	If you watch Al J news or BBC  vs Fox youd see it. But to me our version of this madness is mass shootings...which we lead the world in. 
t1_dtc7vh8	1	*	Some of it sure is
t1_dtc415g	1	*	their goal is kill those who dont believe what they believe, and if you die in the process you go to the good place.  its their religion, and its insane.

t1_dtc6mxo	1	*	I'm sad and it sucks the world is like this.
t1_dtbvzsp	1	*	Let them deal with it on their own. Everyone wants to say what an awful, hateful place we are. So let's focus on actual Americans. 
t1_dtc122n	1	*	What relevance does this have to religion?
t1_dtbxbx7	1	*	The Muslim suicide bomber didnt think they were so innocent.  
t1_dtch2em	0	*	I thought Afghanistan was a paradise! Totally not a shithole!
t1_dtbzqai	1	*	When there's shit in the toilet it's not news. When there's shit on your dining room table, then people will start to care. 
t1_dtc45u4	0	*	Just a day in the life of a country under Islamic rule.
t1_dtcimoz	1	*	I agree with you but I don't think the Middle East was a utopia before the US got involved.  It's a warlike region with a religion that has a substantial violent, extremist segment.
t1_dtd1q4l	1	*	I saw the action movie involving Dostum a few days ago. Pretty good
t1_dtc2m6r	1	*	There will always be collateral damage during war; we can still sympathize with innocent people no matter if theyre killed in a car bombing or a us drone strike. Its unfortunate in either situation.
t1_dtc1snq	1	*	Why? I bet most Trump supporters (and most Americans in general) just don't care. 95+ people dying in some other far away country, while tragic, isn't affecting their day to day lives. 
t1_dtbyohs	1	*	I can almost smell the ham and cheese hot pockets cooking on the small microwave sitting on top of the mini fridge littered with pepe the frog stickers and full of mountain dew code red. 
t1_dtbwfgl	0	*	Beautiful land with rich history ruined by scum ... sad as fuck. Hope everything gets sorted out one day.
t1_dtbshrp	0	*	Don't think they care about the wellfare of the country, If I'm not mistaken some people from Afghanistan still live in tribes, and probably don't give a shit about National Borders.
t1_dtbv8bz	1	*	We did organize, in 2001 to defeat the Taliban. Unfortunately the rest of the world has decided it isn't worth it anymore. And maybe they are right.
t1_dtcglvs	1	*	He did it. He single handedly stopped terrorism.
t1_dtccwf1	1	*	Some could be terrorists. Maybe just 1 right?
t1_dtcjau9	1	*	Proof stability is preferable to democracy These dictatorships kept the extremists in check. 
t1_dtcjo4f	1	*	Yeah we should have let the Taliban just give Osama Bin Laden a nice house and a new car. These people would be living under complete Taliban control if we didn't invade. 
t1_dtc4s17	1	*	Um. Taliban is a fucking terrorist network. He's their spokesman.   Holy. These comment section can be dumb sometimes. 
t1_dtbw4el	1	*	Not until all the opium is...

t1_dtbzx4q	1	*	Religion over nationality.
t1_dtc4tpy	1	*	War is hell. There is evil in the world, and someone has to fight it. Anyone saying otherwise has agenda. 
t1_dtc9l1g	1	*	Homer says it's the worst day of your life....so far.  
t1_dtc0scx	1	*	Ron Paul was right, we shouldn't be there.... I mean look what they do to themselves.... We need to stop meddling in the affairs of other countries.

t1_dtn3gjn	1	*	Europe isn't be swarmed by anyone and the US has had millions of legal and illegal immigrants coming for years. What alternate reality do you live in?

t1_dtoh079	1	*	Not to fan the flames but.. arent Italians the brownest white people on the planet? 
t1_dtojknc	1	*	Not exactly something that happens every day here, not even every decade either. I get how in the US it would be different but a mass shooting here is a huge cause of concern.
t1_dtofxs6	0	*	What about indigenous Italians who view mass African illegal immigration into their country as an invasion? Are you calling for war against them? 
t1_dtokc28	0	*	>Unlike Germany, *literally every other country* has a very complicated history with dealing with its legacy of fascism
t1_dtoifzo	0	*	I agree that those a are major factor. But let's not deny that the migration influx is also a major factor.   Still, violence like this is unacceptable. 
t1_dtpwjvi	1	*	You're being unfair, some of those shooters are like Charlottesville's fine people
t1_dtohvq0	1	*	Wow and people in America think fascism is a huge problem. I had no idea it was that bad in Italy, you guys even have 2 fascist parties. Serious shit.
t1_dtp8z1i	1	*	My guess is it is retaliation. A Nigerian immigrant killed, then cut in half a young italian girl recently. Then he hid her body parts in luggage bags around the city

t1_duazcrh	1	*	Remember Meet the Parents? 
t1_dub1n8q	1	*	Its no more or less natural than a wet nurse donating breast milk or an adoptive mother who wishes to breast feed. They are all taking the same course of drugs to induce lactation.

t1_dujqga5	1	*	You should read the article and formulate your own ideas instead of allowing other people to come up with them for you.
t1_dujnn7b	1	*	I think the same. At least the media is criticizing Trump instead of carrying Obamas water as scandal after scandal pass unnoticed and the result is the media declaring a scandal free presidency.

t1_dtosccj	1	*	I sense a Russian bot or perhaps a misogynist. Either way, you're obsolete and should be replaced ASAP.
t1_dtott03	0	*	According to your logic, we shouldn't own guns because they're used to kill/oppress people. People are celebrating the **choice** to wear it.

t1_dv03sgs	0	*	Youre all ignoring the massive amount of tour bus traffic some of these parks get. There are even a number of parks accessible by public transit. Not every national park is banff.
t1_dv0e49a	0	*	To be fair, it costs money to maintain the infrastructure of the park as well as other things like wages for employees, conservation efforts, etc. 
t1_dv0e66b	1	*	*The idiot in office   ^ Thats what you meant to say in place of the US 
t1_dv06cm6	0	*	Currently in NZ and there are even multiple apps that show camp locations and info about them, among other locations worthwhile tto like about. Anything like that for Canada?
t1_dv00hdp	0	*	Let's be real though some of the best shit is in the parks.
t1_dv0cyhf	1	*	You weren't there for the Harper years.  If a park has literally no funding, they either charge admission or go to shit. Garbage, old tents, no staff, etc.
t1_dv0ewer	1	*	It costs money to maintain parks.  Otherwise it would just be a forest.  I doubt anyone is actually making money off park admissions.
t1_dv0nc3h	1	*	> Free candy at Halloween and now free admission to National Parks?   Yeah, there definitely is a serial killer high up in the Canadian government...
t1_dv0f4is	1	*	Wait. Is free candy not norml?
t1_dv1l36n	1	*	I want to live in Canada :(
t1_dv0eups	1	*	How many parks and reservations in the US have you ever had to pay for? I've been to plenty of both and never saw someone charging a fee.  Maybe something like Yosemite has admission? 
t1_dv0nv1a	1	*	In New Jersey they charge you to use the PUBLIC beaches. Not like a buck or something, 6 to 8 dollars.
t1_duzz7vq	1	*	Canada is different. They have different rules and different values. They don't subscribe to our American ideologies.
t1_dv09iak	0	*	Yes because that's exactly how you create a following.
t1_dv0p827	1	*	Norwegian here, same.
t1_dv0c0qn	1	*	Right, because they protect and maintain themselves. 
t1_dv0fndc	1	*	In the US it's for bringing a car in, not per person.
t1_dv03rh2	1	*	At Banff, supposedly
t1_dv0ep94	1	*	Same in UK...paying to go into a national park? It belongs to the nation! I know they get you on the parking usually but an admission fee...fuck off!
t1_dv0k7td	1	*	No they are not, Yellowstone or Glacier charge entry.
t1_dv07dvm	1	*	No. We properly maintain our best parks and their wildlife like civilized people. User fees are the best and fairest way to do this. We're not savages like wherever the fuck you're at.
t1_dv0udmk	1	*	If the Canadian people own those national parks then why do they need to pay to use them?

t1_dsxyfbe	1	*	Mother Earth aint nothing to fuck with. 
t1_dsy72te	0	*	Did you even read the news? It says Iranian tanker carrying condensate to South Korean. Ship was manufactured by SK, and manned by Iranian crews, yet you blame China for all that?
t1_dsxxuim	0	*	Anything dealing with cancer.
t1_dsxw81e	0	*	[It checks out] (https://youtu.be/FhSB8V3aDKg)
t1_dsy0tye	1	*	Hopefully most of it will evaporate since it's a condensate
t1_dsy30r9	1	*	Another upshot is China has a fuckton of beach and are really good and building new towns and cities.
t1_dsxpz55	0	*	I wouldn't dismiss it that easily but I agree it is less horrible than a heavy crude spill. Less horrible is still horrible.
t1_dsy42yn	0	*	Source? Are you an expert? That contradicts what environmental consultants are saying about the matter
t1_dsxvh84	0	*	The tanker was on its way to South
t1_dsxwkuv	1	*	Throw a match in. Problem solved.

t1_dsy01pw	1	*	It collided with a Chinese grain boat......
t1_dsy3r4b	1	*	It'll fit right in with the looming effects of climate change. Death, it's death; lots of suffering and death. Humans are profoundly shortsighted.
t1_dsy9snu	1	*	Then you have to deal with all those pesky water spills.
t1_dsy2vb8	1	*	Its an iranian boat, dumb cunt.
t1_dsxxb4o	1	*	Light the fucking thing on fire.

t1_dsy4nc4	1	*	BuzzFeed can get fucked
t1_dsxylqw	0	*	Don't give republicans any ideas!
t1_dsxoc1e	1	*	Earth and nature will survive long after we are gone; the question is how long we will survive with it.
t1_dsy1dj7	0	*	Much like British Petroleum I am sure some people will get a harsh talking to and a fine that is pennies compared to the profit. Same as every oil spill.
t1_dsxqqqf	1	*	Dont tell anyone that, it will ruin the pitchfork party and force people to reconsider their preconceived notions in light of facts! Reddit hates that
t1_dsy92a4	1	*	2000 maybe. 
t1_dsyml3l	1	*	Well, no Chinese petrol company (Sinopec, CNOOC) has stations outside China, so you're in the clear there.
t1_dsxv0l0	0	*	Some ships are designed so the front doesn't fall off.  Should have used one of those.
t1_dsy2nfk	1	*	I always assume worst-case is zombie apocalypse unless stated otherwise.  That way, when you find out what the worst-case actually is, then it doesn't sound so bad.

t1_duk03x8	1	*	Until A.I. and robots take over that, too.
t1_duk07zw	0	*	Self-driving cars are *far* closer to being commercially available than a century. Driving is a huge percentage of the workforce. 3%. What happens when 10 million people are suddenly unemployable?
t1_du69df9	1	*	I love that they mention shes survived divorcing Brad Pitt before they mention the millions in camps.   This is the kindergarten version of journalism.

t1_dumvc14	1	*	Boo!
t1_du6g048	1	*	What really that's ridiculous!
t1_du67z8h	1	*	I have a hard time believing those numbers though... I'd guess even just London would have more people than that actually on the streets. 
t1_du64db6	1	*	Also I wonder if this includes travellers in caravan parks. Technically they are of 'no fixed address'. Some of them are loaded too.
t1_du667q1	0	*	Only 4,100 are sleeping on the streets... its actually not that bad st all.  >Broken down, this results in around 4,100 people sleeping on the streets and at least 242,000 in temporary accommodation

t1_dv0rwp9	1	*	I get the point you're trying to make, but hasn't the US started banning neonicotinoids already? And the EU had already banned most of them I think, this is just them also going after sulfoxaflor.

t1_du95w9j	1	*	The bad thing about it is that the funding for public transport is paid via local taxes, and not by tickets. It makes it easier for politicians to cut its funding. 
t1_du9yd6b	1	*	How would it be a net gain? I mean I'm all for it, for lower emission etc.  But revenue on taxed fuel would take a huge plunge.
t1_du9bzuh	1	*	Or, rather, to stop mandating people with children buy health care. It makes a big difference in how you spin it.

t1_ds45886	1	*	We said.   Im thinking that there is a system - Im hoping that there is a system .Is there a system? At the very least , lets hope Twitter bans him. 
t1_ds421tz	1	*	Yeah, but Johnson had the goods to back up the claim.
t1_ds437q3	0	*	How long does diplomacy have to fail before other options are considered? This is not the best option, but NK has been posturing with their missiles against us and our allies for a while now.
t1_ds41sif	1	*	In classier times, sabre-rattling does mean pathetic dick swinging. Unfortunately, we have to spell it out these days.
t1_ds4emus	1	*	Likes tend to follow media visibility and bot activity. Keep in mind around half of Trump's twitter followers are fake according to TwitterAudit. https://www.twitteraudit.com/realdonaldtrump 
t1_ds4331m	1	*	So Trump will have a presidential library. It will be his presidential archive. It will literally be a monument of nonsense. And undoubtedly entirely gold plated with a $10,000 entrance fee.  
t1_ds4iswm	1	*	There were several sources available, yet we have RT on Reddits homepage again. Have we learned nothing?   (Rhetorical question. The answer is obvious.)
t1_ds421zv	1	*	Lol...you think NK was like the Soviet Union?
t1_ds4324u	0	*	I'm still optimistic that this is just some Black Mirror-esque simulation we're all collectively in. 
t1_ds4mk5v	1	*	If it's anything like the history classes I had, no one will read about this for another 50 years because that's the replacement rate of the text books I had thanks to Reagan Era cuts to education.

t1_ds41dr5	1	*	No the peak will be mushroom cloud across America. I guarantee it. 
t1_ds4c1sm	1	*	I think he is trying to distract from some news about to drop. 
t1_ds52dx8	1	*	Its feels surreal to think that these crazy tweets arent just going to dissapear in a few weeks, but are now part of our country's history.
t1_ds41lci	1	*	Allllll down hill from here lol
t1_ds46h4r	1	*	Kim: oh yeah?? wanna try it?    Trump: you're on     *test nukes on Australia*  Australia:  fuuuuuuuu  *NK misses and hits new zealand*  New Zealand: fuuuuuuu  -That's when 2018 peaked.
t1_ds4c55s	1	*	With Trump as President it seems like we are the last generation

t1_ds41ylt	1	*	>Can someone please get the fucking president of the United States to start behaving like an adult?  Was it not evident during the campaign that it was impossible?
t1_ds43xg8	0	*	T_D*
t1_ds4749x	1	*	What can be inferred by this, based on Trumps style of lying, is that he has a very tiny dick.   And it hasnt worked in years.   
t1_ds45tj9	0	*	And kill a shit ton of innocents in the process. That's not a win.
t1_ds4inpr	1	*	This is the comedy timeline, didn't you know? All the comedians in other dimensions peek into ours for material
t1_ds41llw	1	*	They save the fake news to boost him through other social media accounts or weaken his enemies. They use the official news reports to humiliate America with 100% unfiltered Trump.
t1_ds44n0i	1	*	Did you go to his Twitter? He literally said this. I wish he didn't. 
t1_ds431qx	1	*	You know I think this is one of those points in our timeline of history that will go down like those awful roman emperors that were also elected.   
t1_ds48yr7	1	*	You have not seen it erupted yet. 
t1_ds45hxz	1	*	Tried it. Didn't work. Might be a driver problem. Sadly, the latest update was on 1/20/17.

t1_ds42j3z	1	*	shhh! trump will have someone read this and take it as a challenge.  
t1_ds4gjp2	1	*	It was nice seeing him and Obama getting along at the transition then bam he fucks over everything Obama ever did regardless of the good Obama has done. What a bitter asshole. 
t1_ds44uaf	1	*	He lasted less than one day for me.  The debacle of Spicer's first press conference denying how small the inauguration was compared to the women's March was embarrassing.
t1_ds430d1	1	*	This will be right up there with the World War V lectures.
t1_ds4gxec	1	*	Its attitudes like this that makes me wish we still had a draft. Shit isn't so funny when you become part of the reality tv show.

t1_ds42agc	1	*	There's zero dignity in Trump.
t1_ds42wjw	0	*	Just imagine the pop quiz question future children will have to answer.  Trump dared North Korean leader to compare  1. GDP 2. Penis 3. Healthcare quality 4. Military

t1_ds442es	1	*	Lets get real, nobody pays attention in history class
t1_ds403uo	1	*	Not sure how North Korea can wage a war with a starving army. Launching off their payload is suicide. They are all talk and were successful in getting what they wanted up until Trump came along.
t1_ds4dxlm	1	*	It's opening rounds right now. Light jabs or equivilant thereof.

t1_ds44w98	1	*	It's irrelevant. What does the size of the arsenal have to do with it? NK has about as much leverage as they need. Trump's button (god help us if he actually tries to use it) protects nothing.
t1_ds43yu9	1	*	Well one quote sounds like it's from a 5 year old who simply wants to antagonize another 5 year old and the other doesnt. So there's that

t1_dsksywq	1	*	Share our values? I think its pretty clear that the country is divided on values. 
t1_dskni1o	0	*	Ive had this conversation too many times:  Where are you going for vacation?  AFRICA!  Cool, which country(ies)?  AFRICA!
t1_dskpsz5	1	*	Why would we want to move to that shithole country? -Norwegians
t1_dskl9q7	1	*	He pretty much only supports other rich white men. It is the absolute biggest joke of the century that people convinced themselves of anything other than that fact. 
t1_dskp3hz	1	*	The idea is to make America good enough to attract people from the nicest places.
t1_dskp5f3	1	*	Why would it conflict?  Why wouldn't you want to help people stuck in a shit hole country?  Those are people who need the most help.
t1_dskpmlm	1	*	> why would anyone from a prosperous, fair and forward thinking country like ~~Norway~~ Canada  I don't get it, either, but a shitload of Canadians can't get enough of America, trump or no  
t1_dskfy5x	1	*	Help
t1_dskschq	0	*	If you can support yourself > move to US and don't be taxed 40-50% of your income.   If you need to leech off social services > stay in Europe
t1_dskrbij	1	*	And that is exactly why he got elected. Because he tells the unbridled truth.
t1_dskpjf3	1	*	I don't know. I see it like saying Europe is angry over X. It just means that all of Europe is angry. Same here. I'm sure that all of Africa is upset by this.
t1_dskk3dr	1	*	If Africa was less of a shithole then foreign military wouldn't have to be there.
t1_dskjlr4	1	*	Source? 
t1_dsknpof	1	*	All of that can be true about Trump without conflating the problems of the US to those of some countries in Africa.  Its a order of magnitude worse and it is unproductive to try to force a comparison.
t1_dsksf47	1	*	is this real news?
t1_dskm2m6	1	*	Right? Well, the others might think they are shitholes, but we don't think or Country of South Sudan is a shithole.  Edit; clarity 
t1_dskjszm	1	*	No. Let's deport you instead. 
t1_dskszxb	1	*	Exactly, Redditors in a nutshell.
t1_dtsd70a	0	*	Riots and death are my expectations.
t1_dum1kie	1	*	This some /s right?
t1_dulm6cz	1	*	You did some math too
t1_dumblg9	1	*	That's what all the exploitative pedos tell themselves! 
t1_dulo835	0	*	This isn't really an example of that. The dissolution of the opposition party means the ruling dictator had them all jailed/killed. That's not democratic, and that's why we pulled our support.
t1_dulnljs	1	*	Exactly what I was thinking, I don't understand this move.
t1_dsjmxu6	0	*	Why and when were you there?  My roommate and I have both been there, and warmth and generosity would probably be on the bottom of the list for adjectives we'd use.
t1_dsjmoz7	0	*	Why do you think people from countries like, say, Norway don't immigrate to the USA?
t1_dsjmwdw	1	*	Looks like it's getting greater by the minute over there, eh buddy!
t1_dsjn6si	0	*	Do.you think it's acceptable for a nation's leader to call another nation a shithole? Do you think this is constructive in any way?
t1_dsjn23c	0	*	> Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.  And other American lies.
t1_dsjnhbe	1	*	I can guarantee most, if not all, are proud of him. Sad!

t1_duhj3a6	1	*	If you'd read the article you'd see that he tested positive for meldonium which increases blood flow and reduces heart rate.
t1_ds6xwj1	1	*	Oh, that was all a front to try and get around the civil rights act. Nothing more. Republicans are fascists, they want to control everyone's lives and let big business run amok. 
t1_dses7tb	1	*	Most likely.
t1_dt4vevt	1	*	Of course, because why would News Week want to be nailed to the cross they just carved?
t1_dt4x0wb	0	*	What?   All the money in the world definitely can solve poverty. Poverty is being extremely poor. Investing poverty stricken communities would remove poverty. 
t1_dt4x9aq	1	*	There will ALWAYS be smallpox, all the vaccinations in the world will not change that.
t1_dt4xfo2	1	*	Maybe if we had not come this way, we could live and prosper, but I doubt it.  We are a violent race, and we deserve what we get.
t1_dt4xp7d	0	*	Selling billions of stock will also create poverty somewhere else when most people's pensions and savings get wiped out. 
t1_dsrjmno	1	*	No problem, just say they fit the description
t1_dt1zhlt	1	*	Don't tell me what to do

t1_dt1yldv	1	*	Can you provide an example?
t1_dt21a25	0	*	unacceptable when 2 hairy Dmitris get hot and heavy in the vodka cellar  acceptable when 2 hot young girls collide molluscs on a casting couch
t1_dt1pxrz	1	*	She probably was not.
t1_dt1x5n1	1	*	A lot do. But they're a very different kind of Asian people than those you had in mind. And they're mostly hated for the same reason americans hate mexicans.
t1_dt1vn1d	0	*	I highly doubt that. Russians are good people for the most part. Bad apples in every bunch and what not. 
t1_dt1u55m	1	*	>kids having fun  FINALLY HOMOSEXUALS LIKE US HURRRAAAAH  
t1_dunewrb	1	*	It's getting [out of hand](https://www.reportlinker.com/data/series/xfrogmmGl3s) for some time now.
t1_durgqow	0	*	So you think western way of gaining political power is better? Colonization, slavery, and genocide?   or the more modern US model of installing dictators and regimes and start wars everywhere? 
t1_dur25m2	0	*	How does a debt-trap even work?   China isn't pointing a gun at them and demanding they take on loans for infrastructure. They chose to, because India was incapable of providing such resources.
t1_duraevo	0	*	It's like the reverse Opium Wars.  Would be ironic if they take control of some large area of UK land for 99 years.
t1_dur2ozk	1	*	Private investors had been targeting Australia. 
t1_dt0hnkb	1	*	Yeah, freeloaders are gonna be upset, those who contribute more to the EU than they receive is obviously being taken advantage of.
t1_dth44dt	1	*	Start banning people for posting irrelevant political comments outside the appropriate subreddits :D  Would make it much nicer to read stuff that way
t1_dth4ok5	1	*	What is your goal with this?
t1_dtalcu9	1	*	yeah, I don't like Nutella either.
t1_dtc0jms	1	*	Feel the same. It's ok, but I doubt I would even notice, much less miss it if there was no more of it.

t1_dtqvgd6	0	*	cows make horrible child soldiers
t1_dtzvfhp	0	*	I've known plenty of people to work on farms, and they ***all*** say that animal abuse is rampant. There's no such thing as moral enslavement, abuse, and murder of an innocent creature.
t1_dtztdd8	0	*	That's fucking ridiculous, to put no blame on the people who actually performs the torture.
t1_dtzkz7r	0	*	You have summoned the army of vegans. Prepare your inbox for 100s of just do it, Im already vegan and its great 
t1_dtzi7yq	1	*	Amazon Pantry in the UK is nearly all Morrison products. As in they literally just go to where the manufacturer/store is and put them in an Amazon box.
t1_dtzqmk5	1	*	Now, we need people in power to act on it and stop it and bring the guilty parties to justice.
t1_du1bela	1	*	Have you ever read Oryx and Crake?
t1_dtzk9o9	0	*	It really is
t1_dtzxvni	0	*	I think this happens in a lot more places than you think... In Europe I mean. There will always be greedy and corrupt people out there, trying to make as much profit as possible.
t1_dtzhhtq	1	*	I support this 100% and would love it in America as well. I want my food to have a good life with one bad day.
t1_du01b2g	1	*	We need to take it into our hands and stop eating meat. Thats how this stops. 
t1_du0116y	0	*	Im all for ethically treating animals and dont condone abuse eats them
t1_dtzhv2h	1	*	i fucking hope so, we deserve nothing more.
t1_dtzw7q3	1	*	If you are serious, an app like this is your only real option:  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.isitvegan.androidfree&hl=en
t1_du03xp5	0	*	Honestly I can't wait for lab-grown meat to be the norm and have all animals just chillin everywhere without being slaughtered
t1_du0gavh	1	*	Your feelings about it do nothing to help the issue. 
t1_dtzfp87	1	*	The vast majority of the animals in this video need to be euthanized and the owners and operators of that farm need to be sent directly to prison..  
t1_du0q2lx	1	*	Especially when the market is not prepared to pay for it, 
t1_dtzhsut	1	*	We also need to insist more open facilities. Knowledge is power here. 
t1_dtzi5lj	1	*	Try buycott! 
t1_du0m72n	1	*	Lmao no
t1_dtzgjrt	0	*	Not everycountry has huge forests to let animals roam.
t1_dtzj73q	1	*	The brand is pork
t1_dtzkwvu	1	*	My conscience is fine, thanks.  My body too, for that matter.  
t1_du031dh	0	*	what about protein intake if you lift?

t1_dtzh9df	1	*	Here in norway certain products say where they are from (which farm)
t1_dtzlq4d	1	*	Fortunately (for sheep), they are not suitable for intensive farming. That is not to say that they aren't subject to excessive harm and suffering.
t1_dtzxhk3	1	*	Yeah, because if we can't completely eliminate all suffering why bother trying?
t1_dtzxuep	0	*	Because you know how I know someone is vegan?! Ahahahsha /s  People don't give a fuck and then pretend to care when this stuff surfaces. That's why nothing gets done. 
t1_du0g6un	1	*	Nothings going to happen because people arent willing to change their diets. Animal agriculture only has as much power as youre willing to give it. 
t1_dtzrxuj	1	*	Because a horrible life is a lot more unpleasant than a quick death. 
t1_dtzhwk3	1	*	Those images belong to the quarentine zone. Obviously, there's a lot of room for improvement on how they threat sick animals, but those animals are not for human consumption. 
t1_dtzwaug	1	*	Instant vegan if you click the link.
t1_dtzn4ob	1	*	Well I mean you live in the only place on the planet that's not a shit hole, if I remember our great leaders teachings correctly
t1_du037gy	1	*	Water isnt wet you heathen!!!
t1_dtzpwhq	1	*	Im gonna support the most abused ones 
t1_dtzs84o	1	*	Like every company, that's why you need strong government regulations/inspections and whistleblowing programs. 
t1_dtzhqa3	0	*	It's a little easier to do when you only need enough animals to meet the demands of 5 million people. When it's 300 million the demand levels change a bit. 
t1_dtzmdc2	1	*	You better also make sure restaurants are required to provide that rating to customers as well. 
t1_dtzn9t4	1	*	Because many say that the only way is veganism which just isn't true.
t1_dtzrcfx	1	*	Company who makes money off dead animals claims animal welfare is important, lmao. 
t1_dtziqw5	1	*	Just go for it!
t1_dtzh0da	1	*	Just confirms the fears which you might have seen in **Okja**. In a more aggravated form. 
t1_dtzenhx	0	*	...I have.
t1_dtzltyr	1	*	Aliens would do it to us, because they saw how we treat those under our control.
t1_dtzphmt	1	*	Wow, you made me learn something today (ag-gag laws).  It's disgusting...
t1_dtzns17	1	*	More like they will see that we are still needlessly eating animal flesh. Then continue waiting for signs of intelligent life 
t1_du0njez	1	*	Don't mind the grumpy Vegans. They are just irritable from having to get up so early to start milking all those almonds.
t1_dtzow9n	1	*	**Or just change your consumption habits**
t1_dtzzmlt	0	*	I love bacon, pork ribs, sausages, pork chops, etc. Doesn't mean I think the meat industries aren't corrupt and not being held accountable.
t1_du0z480	1	*	You're right, I don't care. I might as well save money by buying my own pigs. I'll horrifically torture them in my basement and no one will ever know.  Thanks for the idea.
t1_dtzwbm5	1	*	First world countries basically need to exploit third world countries to maintain their way of life
t1_dtzgtab	1	*	I want to come to Norway
t1_dtzty8e	1	*	Tell me how it goesU0001f604
t1_du03rwv	1	*	We need more wholesome shit in this world boys.
t1_du12sc7	1	*	95% of pigs live in factory farms and it's standard practice to lower them into gasschambers regardless of anything. 
t1_du05mh7	1	*	Nah meat is absolutely delicious.
t1_du04ihf	1	*	Me too, fuck this shit. I'm ashamed I ever went back to meat, it stops for good  today.
t1_du0lme2	0	*	I can not condone the barbaric and disgusting practice of ripping a poor plant from it's roots, skinning it, chopping it, and throwing it on a salad.  It's a living thing and deserves better.
t1_dtzjy2a	1	*	Its called the but bacon tho effect 
t1_dtzt5j1	0	*	It happens to cows and chickens too. Don't be fooled. 
t1_dtzxfis	1	*	did you not read any of the comments in this thread?
t1_dtzhfi0	1	*	Deadspace meets farming. It's that bad.
t1_dtzxdjt	1	*	I read this as my adopted dad was a pig.... Damnit brain, will you just read the words as written. 
t1_dtzjmb7	0	*	you do realise that the glue in your shoes comes from pigs right?
t1_dtzzq2n	0	*	You mean you dont condone abuse?
t1_du046s4	1	*	British meat is not without it's injustices. Watch the documentary Land of Hope and Glory if you want to see where your meat comes from. 
t1_dtzrwgl	1	*	And this is why Ive finally become vegan. I cant be a part of this horrific industry.
t1_dtzupoh	1	*	Theyre in the killing business 
t1_dtzoyl5	0	*	What the hell are you talking about?
t1_dtzhhg8	0	*	That's a great idea.   We need ways to ensure the raters remain uncorrupt since this industry has a history of bribing pretty much anyone relevant.
t1_dtznlr7	1	*	You dont have to wait for lab grown flesh.   The beyond beef burger is proof of that 
t1_dtzrx8z	1	*	GOP? Of course it is.
t1_dtzjw3a	1	*	[Earthlings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vp7ZBdpKNo)
t1_dtzke4l	1	*	Free-range is a marketing term and doesnt really mean they are out roaming. They may just have a few inches more to move around. 
t1_du38fki	1	*	They don't give a fuck. Their taste buds are more important, even if they tell themselves otherwise.
t1_dtzktjg	1	*	It's really easy. If it's got bits of animal in, an animal was killed for it. If something was killed, it suffered. If something was forced to suffer, there's nothing ethical about it.
t1_dtziq8o	1	*	Spain was always horrible with animals. It got better the last 20 years but it's still very bad.
t1_dtzyjmm	1	*	It isn't radical not to support it, but you only wrote that for sympathy upvotes so... 
t1_dtznl9e	0	*	That is false.  I have a small flock.  They produce eggs and live out their natural lives.     My birds get better treatment than most peoples pets.
t1_du0dwh5	0	*	Haha u gay pussy! I'm gonna chug beer and fry some bacon like a real man to trigger you snowflakes! 
t1_dtzq31y	1	*	Definitely listen to /u/afterdinner. The shit we make cows go through to get milk is horrific.
t1_dtzoio2	0	*	Land of the Free, Home of the Brave.
t1_dtzhd8f	0	*	I live in Canada, I think we are doing pretty well here on food quality and animal rights, and I still envy the Norwegian culture.. can I emigrate please?
t1_dtzn5us	0	*	Ever heard of a vegan?
t1_du04wym	1	*	No forests in most farming areas here in Australia to do that. 
t1_dtzt58c	1	*	Centuries*
t1_du0mpr2	0	*	I would send you a picture of my cat and I rubbing each others cheeks in a loving embrace but I have my hands full of bacon atm
t1_dtzhvuf	1	*	If you eat a dead animal, your food is not ethical. If you really want ethical food, try meatless options. 
t1_dtzsgjy	0	*	What percentage of people here are actually vegetarians?
t1_du0zlf4	1	*	Not all vegans are shunned. Just the ones who compare eating meat to the systematic extermination of six million Jews along with millions of other people. 
t1_dtzjoa8	1	*	How do you humanely( showing compassion and kindness ) kill some one who doesn't want to die ?  
t1_dtzisza	1	*	Also called the bacon, though effect.
t1_du0ylww	1	*	Or just dont eat meat since theres really no reason to.
t1_dtzpu4n	1	*	Looks like in only 3 States. By that definition of America then marijuana is legal in the US.
t1_dtzmpyo	1	*	Sincere question about Norway: how much of what is awesome about Norway would still be there without its oil and the money it provides? 
t1_dtzjfcd	0	*	I understand you, but I also think that we owe it to the animals to at least learn about their suffering. When we willingly avoid hearing the truth we contribute to their suffering.
t1_dtzoko1	1	*	Couldn't agree more
t1_dtzji5r	1	*	It would be much easier to just go vegan. Especially these days with so many amazing vegan meat substitutes. 
t1_dtzmsdo	0	*	The only difficult thing is eating out, the food is just as tasty as eating meat. 
t1_du00w9k	0	*	What do you know about lab grown meat and its accessibility right now? 
t1_dtzk4sl	1	*	Or just stop eating animals. 
t1_dtzixry	1	*	Stop eating meat dude. No fucking app needed.
t1_dtzksnm	1	*	Regardless of what is probable, the risk is there because of the inherent transparency issues, so is your personal preference worth the risk of it happening even occasionally?
t1_du0f7mt	1	*	Why do you care if the animals are abused or not if you still eat meat?
t1_dtztx7g	1	*	Yeah but a burger also costs 59 dollars in Norway, and that's kinda the point.
t1_dtzjrs0	0	*	I encourage you to take the time to look into the egg and dairy industry too. They, sadly, are inseparable from the meat industry itself.   Great job going vegetarian though! 
t1_dtzlsbm	1	*	(Or just don't eat meat, it's that simple)
t1_duvhcex	1	*	Asia != China
t1_du0bi2z	1	*	Gotta get that meat cheap to show off how free your country is.
t1_du0j9jq	1	*	This (El Pozo) is a major, if not THE major meat brand here in Spain, basically every supermarket carries them. It's not some obscure brand which someone found on Amazon by coincidence.
t1_duupwu7	1	*	There is more than enough of those. The problem is sending it to where it is needed. That, and stopping the destruction of surpluses, done to avoid the reduction of prices.
t1_duuov24	1	*	I applied for a company that mines the seabed. Too bad we coudn't find a financial deal and i work a dull job now.
t1_duujqlw	1	*	But...but it's only because the market isn't free enough!  Normal folks would be able to spent billions to mine on the asteroids otherwise!
t1_duuuz48	1	*	> maybe  
t1_duukjht	1	*	Sounds like a good thing. Get your money back plus extra, then an extremely useful metal becomes cheaper and more widely used.
t1_duup2qy	1	*	Why do you think Musk is building rockets?
t1_ds9cy9v	0	*	Wasn't this originally suggested by Clinton?
t1_dsz7zxq	1	*	> an eyewash of a probe  There's an uncomfortable-sounding term.
t1_dszd6kz	1	*	I didn't even see the cops part I thought it was just a random witness..  Jesus those cops are total cunts. 
t1_dtu85jp	0	*	Such brave, such wow, from you
t1_dsrhbnf	1	*	Because he knows religion is horseshit. 
t1_dsbblfy	0	*	Has a girl ever taken you?
t1_dsg7ist	0	*	It figures he would choose a fucking televangelist though.
t1_dsgcty1	0	*	She tosses the donations up in the air.   What God wants, He keeps.   The rest is obviously for her. 
t1_du4zg9o	1	*	i feel like trump would be the same here if allowed...

t1_dudy4q6	1	*	Single layer lattice.
t1_dv4z7f9	1	*	I mean, I'd take that over American cities that just got rid of mass transportation. 
t1_dv5i1bk	1	*	It's the same in my parts.  Every time they dig they find dinosaur fossils.  Like, people not sick of dinosaurs yet?  Can Spielberg stop making these movies?
t1_dv4atwm	1	*	That would be really cool, can't imagine how much it would cost to bring the structure up to modern safety standards though.
t1_dusd6bq	1	*	It's getting monotonous, all of these bullshit claims. 
t1_dtmvthw	1	*	For a bunch of people that claim no collusion and innocence... they're really going hard out of their way to discredit anyone and anyone involved in an investigation. How does that say innocent?
t1_dtmx3li	0	*	Yeah I guess they just breezed over the fact that the Steele Dossier was commissioned by Republicans during the 2016 primaries.  Clinton picked it up, but misleading people isn't good advocacy.
t1_dtwnb7j	0	*	Philly couldn't even handle a Superbowl haha
t1_dt3x0vj	1	*	Far from it.
t1_dt469iy	1	*	Most news is negative.  This sub is actually pretty fair, at least the comment section, imo.  The pro China and NK stuff is usually anti Trump and not anti US.  
t1_dt4wokl	1	*	Unless you're playing Civilization.
t1_dt4drlu	1	*	>  I don't believe anyone has built The Great Library yet.  Jimmy Wales did.
t1_dt3wt5t	1	*	Hey /u/mightierthanthou you always list the US's scientific output as one of the reasons the US is the best in the world. Care to comment on this remark? 
t1_dt40fzd	0	*	So instead of Ghandi wanting to nuke everything it's Donald Trump. Real life is worse than a programming error.
t1_dt4h5k4	1	*	Anyone who ever had to read a large chunk of Chinese articles for their research knows that this is clickbait
t1_dt3xsci	1	*	Lmao. This is the first thing I thought of when I read this. Been playing a lot of Civ V lately..
t1_dt4dxth	1	*	It is a cultural problem for them, but once they are able to fix their shit, if they can, it is going to be a large boost for productivity, education, culture and science output.  
t1_dt437q0	1	*	Saw title and thought Civ.  Top comment continues to not disappoint me.
t1_dt4ji6t	1	*	At first I thought someone fed Science Alert a story about their Civilization game, and SA bought it.
t1_dt49j7v	0	*	It's a victory type; like diplomacy, cultural, domination, or even time.  Wait.  Are we not in /r/civ?
t1_dt4ybhe	1	*	This is Reddit. We want headlines that fit our narrative. We don't wanna read the article, just the headline.  Now do you have a funny gif or an interesting graphic? /s
t1_dt51gjs	1	*	On Reddit, the video game references rule
t1_dt6mawq	1	*	In raw scientific output the EU overtook the US in the early 00's iirc, however in terms of citations the US still is number one by quite a bit.
t1_dt4ihtw	0	*	Would you prefer Science Points? Because I think China is going for the Scientific Victory.

t1_dsez51v	0	*	Next he will be telling us what a stable genius he is.
t1_dti9jgr	0	*	Seriously, I despise donald and voted against him, but I dont get what articles like these think theyre accomplishing
t1_dur3cvg	1	*	Maybe
t1_duvhseg	1	*	Naah man they need viable seed.

t1_dtnenh4	1	*	Wait until the full details from the IG report get released and people like Bernie Sanders were spied on too. The DNC is shitty as fuck.
t1_dtnxz4u	0	*	Wait why are people still posting about the russian conspiracy theory when the memo released pretty much proved it was all a sham?
t1_dtn5aaa	1	*	All of the above maybe?  I dare not think about it... 
t1_dtn8yap	1	*	Like trump has been trying to go to war with North Korea?
t1_dtn959f	1	*	Interesting that you goons all swarm into the normal places only when you think you have something and still get it wrong, nice try.
t1_dtn4wmr	1	*	In fairness, everyone I have heard about it from has called it a  constitutional crisis. 
t1_dtnxkqv	1	*	I felt the same way in 2002... fucking hell. 
t1_dtnbwsz	1	*	let's not ignore as of right now there is a Constitutional Crisis where POTUS is ignoring Law (that he signed) re Russia sanctions.
t1_dtni9az	1	*	I'm currently reading fire and fury and one very omnipresent point is that trump is so easily manipulated that the last person to speak to him has the advantage, scary world we live in. 
t1_dtngr57	1	*	Yeah, denial is a strong suit of the MAGApedes
t1_dtn40lb	1	*	the law specifically left open the door for no sanctions if the WH showed them why they weren't needed. The WH did that.
t1_dtnw55k	1	*	It's tough to see any connections between Trump and Russia through the fog all these Russian bots supporting Trump.
t1_dtn6y95	1	*	Just because we don't want them controlling our country doesn't mean we want war.
t1_dto6tox	0	*	Yeah I can imagine, the exact same as all Left wing media is doing now.   
t1_dtnaeog	1	*	> Is Reddit just going to ignore that Hillary and FBI colluded to subvert the election?  If you had any credible evidence that actually proved that claim, Reddit might be a little bit more interested.
t1_dtniurs	1	*	Reddit is bought and payed for its a shill farm and useful idiots galore.
t1_dtnr4ka	1	*	Yeah, Im wondering what the new country name for the former United States will be?   New Russia sounds nice.  /s

t1_dtn9t13	1	*	> It's incredible to me that there isn't more uproar about Trump not passing the Russia sanctions.  It might be drowned by the uproar of the approaching Saturday Night Massacre...
t1_dtnb345	0	*	Ah yes, we'll just conspire against the government with one of the largest and most advanced active duty militaries in the world, that'll show em.
t1_dtnhibq	0	*	You have it backward bud.  
t1_dtned3o	1	*	The bots are getting dumber.
t1_dtn7ase	1	*	I think you're confusing this with 2016 presidential election. The spies entering the U.S took place when Trump was already president.
t1_dtmtxjv	1	*	Then they've succeeded and have you right where they want you.
t1_dtnvpji	0	*	Facts?  Fuck your facts... DOWN VOTED!
t1_dtnagoj	1	*	Who is CIA Director Mike Pompeo's boss? Trump should fire that guy.

t1_dtna8i8	1	*	Whats crazy is seeing all this russia stuff. And news removed the post with the nunes memo. And no mention of it anywhere else. 
t1_dtn9kck	1	*	The sanctions are based on Russia interfering in our election. He's not exactly inconsistent.
t1_dtocv9k	1	*	You cant tell the snowflakes that, they just want to keep up the smear campaign and have zero clue as to how anything in the intelligence community works. 
t1_dtn67u1	1	*	Coordinating sweeps week.  Gotta get those WH ratings high this year.
t1_dtne11x	1	*	7 great years of prosperity... watch and see.
t1_dtn999u	0	*	If they were negotiating, the obvious question is: what did Donald Trump get in exchange for dropping sanctions?
t1_dtn71bs	0	*	Of course they're going to ignore it. Their heads would explode. 
t1_dtnbj43	1	*	The reason seems pretty obvious. Sanctions on Russia would be sort of admitting that they are interfering, which trump is against  You really cant grasp that reason?
t1_dtn7xcg	1	*	Ironic considering the memo is republican propaganda looool
t1_dtn9jlk	1	*	Don't they technically have like 180 days or something before they have to answer to Congress about why he didn't impose the sanctions?
t1_dtn711n	1	*	This is an old story.   Like two days old. 
t1_dtn4zfu	1	*	Because he has debts no honest man can pay.

t1_dsl6ekm	1	*	How's that?
t1_dsl61mq	1	*	I think you've misunderstood what the UN migration pact is.   It does not define or control immigration policy at all. It merely set out agreeable, non-binding goals.
t1_dtrsw9y	0	*	exactly. IOC plays with fire here, I hope russians sue them for being rassist. You cant just ban people, who had nothing to do with doping, just because of their nationality...  edit: typo

t1_dt8zvst	1	*	Trump has made his favorable leanings towards authoritarianism quite clear.
t1_dt903tt	1	*	The danish government did something similar when the chinese.. (president?) visited. They illegally had officers detain pro tibetian protesters and some journalists. 
t1_dt91hdn	1	*	That would be pretty funny though if she just said they were banned so Trump shows up to even bigger even angrier protests everywhere.
t1_dt8wzty	0	*	Without banning protests, how could she give a guarantee? Does he expect her to talk to everybody and make sure they all like him?
t1_dt8umu4	1	*	He is acting for a sanctuary country.

t1_dta4a48	0	*	Trump is a fascist.  Start with that premise, and everything else makes more sense.

t1_dt8ue0v	1	*	I cant. Scheduling conflicts. - Melania
t1_dta3qdw	1	*	He'll have to grab himself by the himself. That means having two trump together in the same time-line.  Please, think of the timelines 
t1_dt8tr3t	1	*	Yes they do. Certain events and certain locations. London police criminalised a fucking cycle meet up in 2012.

t1_dt9oq9i	1	*	>If Trump is really so worried about the opinion of England, then why is he completely indifferent to the protests against him in his own country...?   This is not the case.
t1_dt9l1rq	1	*	Incorrect. A 2017 poll revealed that ony 22% of the UK supports Trump, and that poll was way back in July, it's probably dropped even lower than that by this point.

t1_dt8yuq9	1	*	He's not white enough to be a snowflake.    Clocktwerk orange maybe?  
t1_dt8ywo8	1	*	That begs the question, does Trump think he can ban protests?
t1_dt8xx6w	1	*	Not to mention the article is incredibly biased and written without much substance and I don't even think the word ban was ever mentioned. But go ahead reddit, keep screaming into the echo chamber. 
t1_dt97fvj	1	*	then its a good thing he didnt say that  he said he would not show up without a warm welcome - Trump isnt even being seen by the queen of england, thats ridiculous
t1_dt8xltw	1	*	You're going to have to try again. That sentence is nonsensical.

t1_dt95bwa	0	*	From reading this story President Pussy seems a little more accurate, particularly when you count his draft dodging.  President Snowflake might be a good fit as well.
t1_dt8yba3	1	*	Thats a violation of free speech, and can be legally challenged if prosecuted for protesting.
t1_dt8zt08	1	*	Okay Trump, don't go.  You're clearly not welcome and we don't want you representing us anyway.
t1_dt8t92a	1	*	I cringe whenever I see videos of trump ignoring and denying any form of scrutiny he receives from journalists U0001f62c

t1_dt8w83t	1	*	Put together like a true northerner 
t1_dt8v96v	1	*	I don't think most people in the UK would care if he visited or not.

t1_dv4ebm7	0	*	Sadly their sales have been down some what of late. Domestic buyers seem less enthused about buying a Hog.

t1_dtwz96t	1	*	Da!
t1_dtwvmbm	0	*	Well then, consider me dangerous, sugar.
t1_dtwz9uw	1	*	Counting machines can get hacked if they're connected to the internet. If we put them on a subnet in a secured facility, then we would be fine.
t1_dtwnt59	1	*	The sanctions are why they did it in the first place.
t1_dtx10j1	1	*	And half the voters don't care because, well, they just don't care. Don't vote. Don't read. Don't pay attention. Don't learn how anything works.

t1_dtx9qpn	0	*	So.... We should just let Russia do it to us?
t1_dtwwz8y	1	*	Why not just do both? I feel like important matters like this we should be fastidious.
t1_dtx26v0	1	*	Don't forget that it's also now his fault that it happened, according to the media.
t1_dtwxzx7	1	*	100% a fan of this. Paper ballots, machine counting, hand counting, and required voter ID.  But it also wasn't the voting system that was compromised, it was the voter registration rolls.
t1_dtwvd1q	0	*	Wow, so the defense of Russian Interference is Obama's response to DJT crying about rigged elections?   **You're defending a hostile nation. Think about that.**
t1_dtwwu30	1	*	I'm am worried that Trump might attempt to use this info to postpone or outright stop the midterm elections in order to further and maybe fatally damage American democracy like Putin wants him to. 
t1_dtx346f	1	*	We already did sanctions when this was headlines 18 months ago.  Trump undid the sanctions after he took office. Go figure.
t1_dtwuojz	1	*	Doesn't that kind of defeat the purpose though?
t1_dtx909a	1	*	It doesn't matter how they vote. It only matters how we count.   - Stalin

t1_dtx7b5t	0	*	Even if they weren't successful they were actively trying to access nation's private information. Spying precisely. Still no sanctions
t1_dtx1bxd	0	*	Nothing to distract from, since it's not really that important.

t1_dtx9r2p	1	*	Well it says Russia in the title so ... :)
t1_dtx4hkl	0	*	Yes, that was the Russian's goal - to get Democrats and Hillary elected. If you believe that, you are delusional.

t1_dtwmpur	1	*	Ahh. I've been looking for a good way to explain delusional to my students. Thank you
t1_dtx8njg	1	*	In France we count by hand. It's easy and fast enough, I don't see why a machine should be involved.
t1_dtx3e0s	1	*	The article doesn't say there was any major or inferred counting fraud.   The issue was the online systems of registration. 
t1_dtwzamc	1	*	You seem unaware that there were two red scares in the 20th century.

t1_dtwvv2s	1	*	They copied the garbage file
t1_dtwsfp9	1	*	This is how it should be everywhere, every time. Its really simple. Listen to the people, ALL the people, and not just some CEOs son(in reference to the electoral college). 
t1_dtwwahx	1	*	There's nothing unusual about a successful pentest ending without further malicious activity, proof of concept in your back pocket for when you decide you want to do something

t1_dtx2sq2	0	*	So ironic considering Trump wanted to audit voter records a year ago and the Dems said it was unconstitutional...
t1_dtxqmy8	1	*	Wapo? NYT? Liberal propaganda rags. You can't t trust anything being said here. This is more bullshit attempting to undermine legitimate authority in the White House.  Or so a trumpette might say.
t1_dtwi7x9	1	*	Do you think Trump is reading this? 
t1_dtwhllc	1	*	He likes to call it Plan Bee.
t1_dtww6uu	1	*	I mean hacking isnt just like you open one door and youve accessed everything. Its possible they breached the system in some capacity, but not the ability to manipulate votes. 
t1_dtwvv06	1	*	For some reason I don't like the word fiddling.
t1_dtx4929	1	*	No, paper ballots. You can't verify that the code being run is the opensourced version yourself.
t1_dtx5y1g	1	*	Popular vote means about as much as who gets the most rebounds in a basketball game. It helps, but that isn't the goal.
t1_dtwj0vq	0	*	>Active in these communities  >    r/The_Donald   *Utterly* inexpected!

t1_dtx5z0a	1	*	theres been misshaps with the voting since Bush was elected afaik and people in charge havent been giving a shit.
t1_dtx1qm9	1	*	Downloaded voter registration roles.  Likely micro-targeting ads to towards active voters via Facebook
t1_dtx6y7v	1	*	Just because there is no evidence doesn't mean that they think nothing happened
t1_dtwl4v5	1	*	How do you think electoral votes are decided?
t1_dtwvyyu	1	*	I hear they have nice health-care but shitty doctors. With American doctors and Russian healthcare, the great Russerica will have the best healthcare in the whole world.
t1_dtx0bnp	0	*	Thats the point, you know what penetration testing is in regards to network security are right?
t1_dtwz8g3	1	*	What was the number of votes Trump said was given illegally?
t1_dtww62v	1	*	The actual votes didn't get hacked, that's impossible except in person with each individual machine. The voter registration database got hacked
t1_dtx3qth	0	*	Lol, you mean he was wrong, not that he lied. 
t1_dtxumqn	1	*	Paper counting machines in Virginia aren't connected to the internet, therefore if any hacking *could* happen, it'd have to be done on-location [note: not very easily].
t1_dtwkzc0	1	*	So elections are suspended until it is fixed right? Im pretty sure people are working on it as a top priority /s
t1_dtx1pmx	1	*	This is a perfect use for block chain

t1_dtx74rn	1	*	They penetrated in to voter rolls.  But there is classified stuff that's not been released.
t1_dtww3n8	0	*	So people can register to vote online.

t1_duok3k0	1	*	Violence against people that are different from you designed to sew terror in their ranks? You'd fit right in with the people you hate most, actually, if you just followed their religion.
t1_duob5od	1	*	ooh you so edgy son.
t1_duoxgni	0	*	Same, as much as I regret voting for Trump
t1_duo7lqg	0	*	Seems like he wants vigilantes.  Problem with that is his victims can also retaliate with vigilantism.  Best to just leave it up to the government.
t1_dup0900	1	*	No when it has a political agenda it's terrorism  If it's just crazy white guys wanting to kill someone because he didn't like his breakfast that morning it's not terrorism

t1_ducuzbz	1	*	Its so bad! You know whats *not* bad though? The cool, refreshing taste of Sprite
t1_ducrezu	1	*	Seems like the Wikileaks subreddit is run by Russian agents.  It no longer has a pretext toward impartiality. IMO failure to adequately manage propaganda disguised as something else is egregious. 
t1_duckxjm	0	*	Everyone knows that news must reach certain threshold of importance in order to merit posting or discussion. Any news of less importance than American intervention into Syria should be ignored.

t1_ducsx1e	0	*	Defending our elections against foreign interference is liberal propaganda in 2018, wow. Trump supporters and republican party voters have allowed themselves to become unimaginably delusional.

t1_ducm359	1	*	That was my thought.  Lots of days old accounts pushing nonsense, and the older ones comment history speaks for itself.
t1_ducvog0	1	*	it's only because of r/scottishpeopletwitter that I read this without realizing there was a typo until I'd scrolled waaaay down. This comment I just wrote is not important but okay.

t1_dt1701h	1	*	Small arms and ammunition are the big ticket items insofar as sales go for Germany. Yeah, they also sell big ticket weapons, but it's the small shit that really rakes in the dough.
t1_dt0ethy	1	*	Saudis don't buy much of their weapons from Germany though, so no it wouldn't hurt that much at all.

t1_dsvqg9e	1	*	I apologize for my blunt rebuttal but W blew goats.  His response to 9/11 made America...undesirable. The TSA and the war on terror sucked soooooo bad.  So bad 
t1_dsvqcmm	1	*	Ya'll should really just admit you want America to be a white ethno-state. It would really make your arguments make a whole lot more sense.

t1_dsk7kev	1	*	but that one super anti-trump guy on CNN kept calling him a racist and kicked another guest off air! fucking pathetic.
t1_dsktume	1	*	He also said he wanted more asians. I guess asians aren't minorities according to the left because they're successful though.

t1_dsju25s	0	*	So are most red states.
t1_dsjyl7m	0	*	There might be bad areas in every country, but the amount of them varies.  I don't think anyone seriously believes that ISIS controlled territory and the Vatican have an equal amount of shitholes.

t1_dsjzurz	1	*	WH admitted he said it.
t1_dsk3h7n	1	*	I don't think Trump should have said this. It's certainly not something any high ranking government official should openly say. He isn't, however, entirely wrong.
t1_dsks8ur	1	*	Bannon would have said it better and we wouldn't be having *The Camp of the Saints* type discussion.  It would be more smooth.

t1_dsk5m0b	0	*	From context he appears to be meaning the people, because he's using it as a justification to block them from immigrating to the US.
t1_dsjwutd	0	*	Being a citizen of Norway is a dream of mine. I would gladly give up my citizenship to be in Norway. Capitalism and individualism is dogma I dont relate to.

t1_dty08nv	1	*	I prefer natural time but mostly because I have an extremely hard time waking up in the mornings and during DST I drive to work in total darkness. It throws off my entire sense of day
t1_dtyj9pb	1	*	I'd sure welcome this.
t1_dtym4ar	1	*	GMT will be replaced by UTC.
t1_dtza1l2	1	*	As soon as the first country abolishes it, it is likely to start a domino effect and, in time, all the remaining country will follow suit.
t1_dty1t4j	1	*	No, time is a human invention.
t1_dty87s3	1	*	Because it fucks me up twice a year and I am tired for a week or two absolutely demolishing productivity as my sleep schedule adjusts.
t1_dtxzxh0	0	*	But DST is summer time, winter time won't be affected at all.
t1_dtxyq9q	0	*	We have the EU to make things be the same in the whole EU and they decided this nonsense? 
t1_dtxz01d	1	*	I like it. What I'd like even better is Standard Time coupled with working hours shifted 1 hr earlier. Same as what you describe, but keeps solar noon around clock noon.
t1_dtxz9vw	1	*	Alot of people are wanting to stay on DST, makes sense to me, more sunlight in the evening is better.
t1_dty6rm0	1	*	I know man. I've got SAD so even my summers are ruined by dreading winter.
t1_dtyepx1	1	*	Bed time?
t1_dtz8v9b	1	*	Turkey actually just did that. Went from GMT+2 to GMT+3 two summers back and just stayed there ever since :)
t1_dtyajj7	1	*	Right you are, Ken.
t1_dtymwa0	1	*	Daylight SAVING.
t1_dtxya6l	1	*	Does anybody really care?
t1_dtyqhko	1	*	Right....  it went from an absolutely GREAT headline, to something lower than SWINE SHIT in a matter of a few sentences.
t1_dtxy1c2	0	*	Why is this comment so hard to find?
t1_dtyk185	1	*	Why not just start work later 
t1_dty90gl	1	*	Right? It's like but otherwise the summer days are shorter!    The sun sets at *nine* in the summer, what do you want?
t1_dtycqy4	0	*	You do realise amount of sun doesn't change? But time change causes spike of suicides in Finland every year.
t1_dtyb7sv	1	*	I feel the opposite, I cannot stand when the sun is up late. So I'd prefer to abolish DST.
t1_dty144q	1	*	What people want and don't realize is an expansion of DST to possibly the whole year.  I hope my country never goes permanently to standard time just because people don't understand which is which. 
t1_dty5xw7	1	*	On the bright side, maybe this is a sign that power is slowly being restored to EU nation-states and not entirely dictated by bureaucrats in Brussels.
t1_dtzdtoh	1	*	It would make for a better compromise to change forward/backward 30 minutes and leave it permanently in between DST and Standard time.
t1_dtxztrv	1	*	Definitely. Summer time all year round. This is what we need.. 
t1_dtya11a	1	*	Hopefully enough countries decide to end it making it too inconvenient for hold-outs to keep doing it, including non-members.
t1_dtxykyy	1	*	How do you know it has a positive impact if you've always had DST
t1_dtxpn6t	1	*	How so? UTC doesn't have DST applied to it. So there'd be no change at all.
t1_dty41cs	1	*	Daylight savings makes sense in the nordic coutries.
t1_dtynyfe	0	*	I agree. There is only one valid time scale, all these phony zones are false. It's the 21st century for fuxake. 
t1_dty2pyq	1	*	It was first campaigned for in England
t1_dty53qo	1	*	I like to put my savings in the oven. It tastes just like my mom used to heat up.
t1_dty45x7	1	*	So sad I had to scroll down here to read your comment. Thanks, sheeple! 
t1_dty1dk4	1	*	It was a temporary measure implemented during wartime rationing, which has no real benefit anymore and causes all sorts of confusion.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time
t1_dtxwf7i	1	*	That's why it says proposal in the title
t1_dty0105	0	*	Look at this man! Totally unamerican! Benjamin Franklin suggested this* and he is a true American hero! We should be keeping this as our patriotic duty!  *source: National Treasure ft Nicolas Cage.
t1_dty2h76	1	*	It's for farmers. I still don't like it though, It'd probably be easier for them to change their schedule twice a year then make the entire fucking country change their time.
t1_dtyj7i1	1	*	Yea, but we don't get any interest on it. I only get 1 hour back at the end of the year.
t1_dty98pb	1	*	https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/7w4zsk/european_parliament_approves_proposal_to_end/dtxtas4/  Somebody found it already. Exactly what you expected.

t1_dtxxu8m	1	*	Hmm actually was shibboleth sso also not throwing some surprises with the DST? It's Y2K all over again, get your survival gear ready!
t1_dty0s80	1	*	Or maybe several countries asked to abolish that and this opens the way for them to do so 
t1_dty2z0x	1	*	In Canada, we call this Saskatchewan.  they're edgy.
t1_dty4jsj	0	*	...but thanks for not writing 'Savings'
t1_dtyhxq1	1	*	Just move the schedule for everything an hour back instead. It makes sense to have the sun at its highest around 12.00.
t1_dty6d30	0	*	I like that the sun is in the south at noon. In summer its more complicated.
t1_dtxxcfp	0	*	I like the earlier mornings and the darker evenings give me more time to do boring indoors things.

t1_dty1znm	1	*	Tool Time!
t1_dtxzvm6	1	*	No, that is what leap days (february 29) are for. Daylight savings is an electricity saving thing. Or well started out as one. Not sure how effective it is nowdays.
t1_dty5ozn	1	*	Dolt.
t1_dtyhomb	1	*	It sounds realy weird indeed when you say you're from Canada.
t1_dty1mpg	0	*	all the points. you get all the points today, well as long as it's daylight.

t1_dtxugva	1	*	All I know is that its 5 oclock somewhere 
t1_dtyeo4f	1	*	Amen, I hate that shit.
t1_dtr2uxq	1	*	And china responded by moving a solar panel company to Florida in less than 24 hours.  Trump is not Bush.
t1_dtr649v	1	*	Its not that simple but yeah, in this case, its not meaningful.
t1_dt2b3ju	1	*	Bienvenidos a Mexico.   Everyone wants to play cartel, but it could also be as simple as them being picked up and robbed.

t1_dt1rywn	0	*	Yes but published today by Newsweek because the report is from this month. I keep reading on here that sometimes investigations take a while.

t1_dtlph2r	0	*	It's a species of kingfish. They don't eat humans 
t1_dswd5qj	1	*	That won't help, Schools everywhere teach about equality amung humans. If a parent raises their kids saying Jews are evil greedy backstabbers, the child will think that no matter what school says.

t1_due3v9a	1	*	There is a difference between not supporting the US prison system and just allowing people in, though. Countries like Ireland can bar Russians from entering without also extraditing them to the US.

t1_ds1bc1n	0	*	If it means we'll be more closely aligned with Inda its a really good move. There must have been some reason why all previous administrations provided aid, however. What were we getting in return?

t1_dueoi66	1	*	I remember when Americans did not defend attacks by Russia on its institutions. Oddly enough, it was Republicans who were the staunchest defenders against such attacks.

t1_dud974m	1	*	Because the Bernie bros are useful idiots 
t1_dud3fon	0	*	How so? They do say no Americans knew that they were Russian. So I am still waiting to see if he actually drops any indictments against US citizens, rather than ephemeral lying to the FBI charges. 
t1_dudj81b	1	*	Russians have been working to diminish democracy all over Europe for years. Just because you weren't aware of it until doesn't make it untrue

t1_ducxjet	1	*	Yeah the only place these guys are getting extradited to is the afterlife after some freak plutonium poisoning and vehiclular accidents kills them all in a strange string of events.
t1_ducrqqi	1	*	Yeah they use the term unwittingly to describe the way campaign officials would interact with Russian's posing as others. Trump's entire operation appears to criminally stoopid.
t1_ducmzt5	1	*	Why not?
t1_dud2flc	1	*	yeah ... oh wait ... republicans start wars    relevant username btw!
t1_dudb0bc	1	*	I'd upvote you to +13 if I could, but it's -13 right now and it seems fitting.

t1_dud555d	1	*	Have you heard about Trump's base?
t1_dudnhwe	1	*	Elaborate?
t1_dud6pvk	1	*	The sky is blue.  I didn't say it, but that doesn't mean that grass isn't green, it just means that's not what I said in that particular sentence.

t1_dudieqq	1	*	Why sad? Is that not true?
t1_dud4jv1	0	*	Take a break from politics, you've started posting in news article format.
t1_ducpg9h	1	*	I wouldn't count on any of them flipping. They probably will never speak to Mueller at all, especially if they're currently in Russia.
t1_dud95wa	1	*	Not really. They pushed Bernie and Trump and so far has shown no direct connection that appears intentional for either campaign. They started this effort before Candidates had even announced. 
t1_dud57yn	1	*	Or made memes about frogs and turning them gay.
t1_dudgtl4	1	*	Thats the point. A safe scapegoat 
t1_dud9x7f	1	*	It only means the investigation isn't over, and there is actual evidence of tampering. 
t1_dudgbiu	1	*	Not surprised to see this at the bottom of the comments.
t1_dudtvke	1	*	Who is this we? Do you have a mouse in your pocket?
t1_dudeuxu	1	*	What part of this indicates a larger conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia?
t1_dud9f5u	0	*	Well...it's hard not to focus on that when it's demonstrated to be pretty much true over and over again.
t1_dudetod	0	*	You're implication is that a billion dollar campaign was defeated by a few Facebook ads. That is utterly ridiculous. 
t1_dudexsy	1	*	Also makes the Bernie Bros seem even more justified about the primary.
t1_dud3r3a	1	*	Were you aware that Trump's campaign chief and a cabinet member have been formally indicted?
t1_dud52jd	1	*	But.... I don't want to live in interesting times.
t1_dudd2zr	1	*	Just supported the two most radical candidates, Bernie and Donald. 
t1_dudamb8	1	*	Fuck that bitch, this is Russia.
t1_dud7ry1	1	*	Yeah the term 'breaking news' has been overused to the point of being meaningless. Might as well drop the 'breaking' part.
t1_dud8n70	1	*	Nothing at all. They organized anti trump rallies as well. Read the article. 
t1_dudnlij	1	*	Next time? Trump needs to be impeached. 
t1_ducx9ut	1	*	>the indictment  You know a specific indictment does not refer to the entire case right? it is a piece of the puzzle, not the puzzle itself.
t1_dudu3bg	1	*	Just another sad day in America...how many will it be next time...
t1_ducueos	1	*	Mueller isn't an international law investigator.    This is like asking why your local beat cop didn't help kill Ghaddafi.
t1_dud4s3m	0	*	Stop.  Mueller time
t1_dud5i1w	1	*	Thanks for admitting it. This proves that all hope is not lost with Trump voters. 
t1_dud3cq1	1	*	He said no Americans are charged _in this indictment_
t1_dudlhsy	1	*	That's purposely misleading. They also organized a pro-Trump rally the same day. They wanted a fight between the two groups.  https://i.imgur.com/TnAeaeF.png
t1_dudgm24	1	*	Pretty sure this article kinda proves that they're already in cahoots with Trump?
t1_ducyad9	1	*	That just means this operational cell didn't contain any Americans. If you follow the money trail, who knows?
t1_dudc6g8	1	*	By this logic, your country deserves to be slaughtered by Aboriginal Canadians.  How about we just have principles instead, where something is just wrong to do?
t1_dud99f7	0	*	lol you guys blame the burglar but you should be criticising the homeowner
t1_duco2yw	1	*	Wheres Vladimir?
t1_dud9ow3	1	*	This forum doesn't like puns I guess. 
t1_dud7ur9	0	*	Rosenstein was speaking about this particular set of indictments. Not all indictments have been made or even unsealed yet.
t1_dudmf8t	1	*	Well Trump is refusing to do anything about that. He claims he doesn't even think Russia was the ones behind the election hacking and interference. 
t1_ducu8zy	1	*	Those were the two most radical candidates. 
t1_ducu8za	1	*	It continued past the Democratic primary.

t1_dubowkw	1	*	Maybe they were after disparate. Its only 1 letter off.
t1_ducegbs	1	*	US first destroyed the whole Iraqi Army, punished all officers and left the worst Army in the world. Maybe look into roots of problem, not what you want to see. 
t1_dspq9zw	1	*	Hahaha.. Shake may be!
t1_dstb0i8	1	*	The term refugees is also misleading. Middle East is not bordering France. 
t1_dsfzj81	0	*	No. I'm beginning to feel we need to limit psychopaths access to things.

t1_dub50f0	1	*	Yeah, but that became kind of obvious when they turned down leaks on the Russian government and Assange got a job at RT. They have their own agenda to push for sure. 
t1_du9kx36	0	*	I have been very happy to see the tide turn on Assange. I've thought he was an asshat from the beginning. Just an angry provocateur who wants to burn it all down rather than fix anything.
t1_dua3zhv	1	*	You mean it was collateral murdered?
t1_du9doed	1	*	I get your reference
t1_dub6xmg	1	*	It's not just a matter of being partisan either. They're anti-American, and they realize putting Republicans in power is the best way to harm America.
t1_dua1pwa	1	*	What a world we live in...
t1_dua5lvc	1	*	Well that's obvious. The information leaked hurts powerful people so those will paint it as bad. The most direct fix would be to fix the bad things being leaked but that's unrealistic.

t1_ds5j6d9	1	*	No, it's pretty obvious that there is treason here.  When Bannon admits it, it's pretty much proof that any reasonable person can't deny  the treachery of the trump crime organization
t1_ds64cir	1	*	your problem is that you talk about The left and  The right  What about thinking about The facts? 
t1_ds5c4cl	0	*	By praising you mean liking one thing he said, right?
t1_ds5e2v7	1	*	This comment deserves reddit GOLD!
t1_ds549zw	1	*	Old Cocksuckin' Steve.
t1_ds5ugpu	1	*	I think he has a rule never to burn bridges with truly amoral or corrupt people. He respects their amorality too much, and in the end, he needs people like that. 
t1_ds5lw5l	0	*	A former close advisor says these things about  his boss...it's kind of a big deal.
t1_ds5avac	1	*	Yeah, shows the scumbags are turning on themselves.
t1_ds5sdzf	1	*	Pretty sad you have to ask, isn't it? Want to know what's wrong with America? There you go. 
t1_ds5r1b9	1	*	Its called a smoke screen. 
t1_ds5i7xt	1	*	Oh America SMH
t1_ds5rwod	1	*	Its so surreal to hear, I lived in New Hampshire when trump made his huge visit before the election. 
t1_ds58mrl	1	*	Not for state crimes, thus another reason to play  follow the money and bring state (NY, Im lookin at YOU) AGs into it.
t1_ds5cla6	0	*	There's increasing evidence that something is going on there and it's not like Trump is doing himself any favors.
t1_ds5l810	1	*	You're not being serious, are you? 
t1_ds5hjjk	1	*	This book is going to surpass the Bible in sales...
t1_ds55a2u	1	*	Ministry of Truth, but shitty and real
t1_ds5pkqf	1	*	My prediction was that they would go to their usual scapegoat, Hillary. Sure enough, a Hillary conspiracy was the #1 post.
t1_ds5ekw2	1	*	Bannon is Darth Vadar.
t1_ds5gm3a	1	*	Pretty sure Trump's 'nuclear option' is *actual* nuclear war.
t1_ds5duzk	0	*	No need to pretend the Russians are bad.
t1_ds509tf	1	*	So why did Trump just attack Bannon?
t1_ds5gats	1	*	So why didn't he?  He should have turned informant immediately.  He had a dog in the race so he didn't hang them out to dry right away.
t1_ds54qwa	0	*	Flip it around, On national TV, they're going to crack Don Junior like an egg.  He's saying when the metaphor is going to happen.
t1_ds4r2gj	1	*	There is a reason for him to come out like this 
t1_ds5qtrz	1	*	You are correct. Theyre too invested to ever admit they were wrong. They sold their souls long ago.
t1_ds5ess9	1	*	How does that all not apply to himself? As in, why did Bannon not call the FBI a year ago?
t1_ds6bdef	0	*	How does anything attributed to Steve Bannon get labeled as credible?  I dont care if hes saying what I want to hear, the guy is sketchy as hell.
t1_ds5j1cm	1	*	Its on tape
t1_ds59yup	0	*	He just repeated 3 month old news as news. He did not reveal anything new and he got a book to sell.
t1_ds5h9t7	1	*	Id prefer Martin Sheen pretending to be Jed Bartlet 
t1_ds6mv40	1	*	Don't be fooled by the illustration.  The creep on the far right is the worst of them all.
t1_ds4wzux	1	*	When people show frothing interest in these political gossip books, you know that they are only interested in politics insofar as a man wearing a cheese hat is interested in the Packers game.
t1_ds5erdl	1	*	or is tte keyword you're ignoring 
t1_ds62vdo	1	*	Great show and quote.
t1_ds5mt3t	0	*	Yeah, I don't think you're living in the real world champ

t1_dtw31wb	1	*	>take their cue from the Brits and just call it Great Macedonia.  Maxedonia.

t1_dujfam4	1	*	Yeah, i heard there is gonna be a funeral with cake and everything 
t1_dsnef93	0	*	Humans can do that too. There's plenty of people who have run a marathon (42 km) every day, some for more than 10 consecutive days. I'm sure they could have added an extra 8 km/day to make it 500 km.
t1_dsnos8e	1	*	the world can be bigger than we give it credit for at times
t1_dsn8ozd	1	*	Balanced the ecosystem.
t1_dsnnduu	1	*	This is the most poorly written post I've ever seen on Reddit. 
t1_dsntpf0	1	*	Yeah, really nice for the wolves to be able to cross into Belgium without having their passports checked at the border. Good for them.
t1_dtzl3pm	1	*	/r/monstermath
t1_duxfnc3	0	*	The law doesn't penalize any research. Take a minute and read my comment to see original text of the law to see what is it about (just two sentences).
t1_dt9ydao	1	*	I still pay for plastic bags at grocery store because i need them for my home garbage bins
t1_dt8joco	0	*	I'm under the impression that most biodegradable plastics aren't that great either.
t1_dt8v0dr	0	*	Well, actually, deforestation is the problem with those.  Ultimately the ideal is to stop using disposables entirely and use things that can be reused or recycled. 
t1_dt8ojbu	0	*	Really? western countries are still the ones that decided standards worldwide. If they push for less plastic, it will have an impact everywhere. 
t1_dt8oktb	0	*	California charges for plastic bags and we 'all' ended up getting reusable tote bags.  It's relatively recent though. 
t1_dta5b6w	1	*	That's not true he isn't hated here at all.
t1_dt9uu01	1	*	Canada's just gonna have to run that show too.
t1_dt9cdiu	1	*	I almost, ALMOST feel bad for Trump. I don't because, you know, but I can't imagine how he is going to react to this. No doubt cops are going to flood Quebec from all over the country for this one.
t1_dt96kkf	1	*	Maybe they can sign before he gets back from Switzerland and makes it G6.
t1_dut9a16	1	*	EX-ORCISTS!
t1_duttgu8	1	*	Or put them in mandatory training as exorcists. A nice little romp with a demon or two might help them control their urges to romp with children... 
t1_dsl7bqi	1	*	Not soon enough 
t1_dsz4qb7	0	*	It's from this blogger's first-person account:  http://david-collier.com/eugenics-university-of-warwick/
t1_dtb0bnq	0	*	Well, he's sick and he's heavily dependent on fetanyl so he's gonna die soon. That's kinda new.
t1_dseojs6	1	*	Poland. Hungary. Japan. South Korea. China. Vietnam.
t1_dse0n8q	1	*	Countries have a right to determine who can become a citizen, there are multiple ethnostates that already exist. 
t1_dtfa8lu	1	*	shudder
t1_dsmcvkv	1	*	Look into his interviews. He's actually quite reasonable. Joe Rogan and Dave Rubin both gave him a chance to explain his situation.
t1_dt3a23t	1	*	Your comment is very ignorant. Archeological finds are most certainly world news as they hold historical significance. 
t1_dubt97z	1	*	Theoretically, they could tie is up for a while. Realistically, the Canadian Senate has zero effective power over legislation, and is effectively a rubber stamp. 
t1_dv3e3r0	1	*	OK so you're saying we need to store guns in attics.  Less massacres that way.  OK cool easily done!
t1_dv2f9l8	1	*	Not really anywhere higher than the two-three in France over the past 8 years.
t1_duoh27h	0	*	Please dont. Theyd end up in the US. 
t1_dsymv8o	1	*	US was never welcome in Okinawa and never will be. 
t1_dsyvghd	1	*	yea I bet trump responded to this one personally
t1_dsyjrwy	1	*	North Korea, China, and part of Russia.  That's why.
t1_dsyoqn3	1	*	because japan literally pays us to stay.
t1_ds4v1au	0	*	The enemy of my enemy is friend. They're just gearing up to unify and take us Americans out.
t1_du4c2ns	0	*	Actually thats not right any more.   You can use any of the big 4, as long as youre with a big 4, to withdraw money FOC.   Think this was a 1 January thing
t1_du4iphc	1	*	Anyone know anytthing about Croatian banking law? We could build a basic internet banking website & become a big Croatian bank, the biggest hurdle would be all the legal stuff
t1_du46ra6	1	*	No. They are here for themselves until they can get something passed that has a big payout and they quit and keep their taxpayer funded pension. 
t1_du5lcp6	1	*	If you get your info about the Australian Government from reddit, they will look bad since the government is centre-right
t1_du4fbhs	0	*	But the ad on the TV. They said..... they said...... that they were about the people. I saw it, its real
t1_du5co4q	1	*	I use Coles/Woolies cashout more than ATM due to this reason..
t1_du5bbzr	1	*	Switch to ING. I could go to the pub and the ATM will charge lets say $3.50, ING puts that straight back into your account.  Edit: the refund back into your account is immediate. 
t1_dtgqyaa	1	*	Sure!  The Oligarchs suck mother Russia's tit,  while the rest of her children eat shit!
t1_dth0s2q	1	*	> The Clintons  They're not billionaires. Koch, Soros, Thiel are the one's I'd definitely look at. They've been pulling strings on both sides
t1_ds7y71o	1	*	All of these can be changed. Look at China, they still have many of these problems but they have worked to change many of these things over decades.
t1_ds7wgqa	0	*	Yeah. Superpower by 2020 is a famous joke among indian redditors.
t1_dv11jwq	0	*	Probably not, hell probably change his mind once he realizes how much this alienates his base.
t1_dusclo9	1	*	That was really fast. If I knew my information was sold that fast I would be really pissed.
t1_dusq3j7	1	*	Or just demand stricter privacy laws, or store in a country with strict privacy laws, to protect their users data.
t1_dus6xx0	1	*	Lately? 
t1_dus8thq	0	*	Safer, in terms of not getting arrested because one file somewhere had something remotely critical in it. I'd say it's better in that aspect.
t1_durylcw	1	*	No, they dont. 
t1_duser0s	1	*	Same reason people use offshore banks. Sometimes you dont want to be subject to your own countries laws.
t1_dus22cy	1	*	Yup. I never trusted them in the first place; when that was revealed my suspicions were confirmed.  
t1_dusanuf	1	*	 Gotta encrypt the shit out of some of my files then... unless the encryption software I'm using has a backdoor in its bottom
t1_dubbo7s	0	*	Alaska?  They have weed stores up there.
t1_dub7frv	0	*	Went for the hell of it, 10/10 would go again.

t1_ds4cmom	1	*	He's only doing his job because people are paying him to do it, I guess?   How jobs work 101?
t1_ds4c78g	0	*	Maybe it's ritual sacrifice. 
t1_dsbm00s	0	*	> Oh MayDay can't even do minor evil.  Only big-time evil like running through wheat fields.
t1_du14wdy	1	*	Funny cos those countries had no problems with arming ISIS in Iraq and Syria, and Afghanistan for that matter. I suppose they can't be seen arming both sides of the conflict, that wouldn't be moral...
t1_du0pnbv	0	*	or russia, china wants to keep up its illusion till its ready to fuck over everyone.
t1_du0ojtw	0	*	I think we can pass on selling choppers to a guy who publicly claims to throw people out of choppers. There comes a point where supporting the lesser of two evils is just supporting evil.
t1_du19b4d	1	*	And no bothersome conditions like with the west! /s
t1_duz126a	0	*	Thundersnow is awesome.
t1_duz6sye	0	*	I've done some reading and if the arctic continues to warm, then we could have more vortex splits in the future.
t1_duz8lea	1	*	> the weather  Climate.  Giant body of water rapidly warming up is not weather.
t1_dtyaz23	0	*	We need to get to the roots of his motives.  How was the seed first planted?
t1_dug3e06	1	*	Take it as face value - Tillerson is actually listening.
t1_dup3rlf	1	*	Here's proof lmao
t1_ds4mruu	0	*	And if hey dont, is it cheaper for the abortion or for the kid to be on welfare and government services their entire lives?
t1_ds4q4da	1	*	No, I dont think so. I think it works only on the embryonic stage. It wouldnt be guaranteed to work after this point and a surgical abortion is required.
t1_dtxxd79	0	*	How? 
t1_duhnl0j	1	*	Drug in question supposed to give you more stamina allowing you to work out more.  I'd imagine that would help with sweeping prolonging how much you could sweep at full strength before tiring. 
t1_dui32kk	1	*	That's like the least Danish name in existence
t1_duiink2	1	*	Meldonium is a supplement and was even widely available on ebay until 2014.

t1_duhudu3	1	*	Beta blockers? Calming agents?

t1_dtvucoe	1	*	What if the Canadians involved actually do care deeply about free helicopter rides for dealers and addicts? Sometimes, the money is just a nice side benefit. 
t1_dt5xa27	0	*	just sweeping them over to the next room...

t1_dsltl6q	1	*	what if something went wrong. Burning initials into living organs sound like a fucking horrible and dangerous thing.
t1_dslywgb	1	*	Just a gut feeling.
t1_dsm3x4r	1	*	That's what's happened.   He also has community service. 
t1_dslrufu	1	*	I would have let him do it on the condition that he takes requests. Could start a new organ tattooing industry..
t1_dsw3dlx	0	*	Meanwhile pundits, and tv shows only talk about Trump because it gets them ratings never mind everything else happening in the world lets focus on this one guy for years.
t1_dswf7wq	1	*	Human existence will never be without consequence.  We are ignorant to think otherwise.  Its a Utopian dream.

t1_dswgkhb	1	*	Fucking amen.
t1_dswepku	1	*	Maybe they should take a picture of it next to a banana?
t1_dsvvit8	1	*	To be fair though, they're the ones who really, really, really needed to join. 1.3 billion people and a massive dependance on coal was not cool.   Lookin' at you too, India.  
t1_dsw6hu8	1	*	Well this spill is still expanding but Valdez was WAY bigger (11,000 square miles versus 40 so far for this spill).
t1_dsw4gsd	1	*	>The tanker was carrying condensate, an ultra-refined, highly volatile form of ultra light crude oil used to make products such as jet fuel.     Which makes for juicy conspiracy theories. 
t1_dsvqm2m	1	*	> North Korea is a threat?   It's a million barrels of jet fuel that was going to South Korea from Iran ... I dont think this was an accident.
t1_dtfe5ze	1	*	Look at the source. Vice.

t1_dv3au5h	0	*	As a serious question, and Im not trying to gotcha, just honestly curious, what drew you to supporting him in the first place?

t1_dv47o3g	1	*	I'd love to read an analysis by somebody who has been observing r/the_donald closely for the past year.  How has it transformed over time? How has it reacted to each new scandal and development?
t1_dv3liqh	0	*	All the people who downvoted you probably didnt even read the IRA indictment in which the facts you just mentioned are presented. But they're  probably just bots anyway
t1_dv34frh	1	*	To be fair i made one comment disagreeing with an anti-trump comment here on world news and  was banned. Had to seek out a level headed mod to help fix the issue. 
t1_dv3lbiw	0	*	Most lefties...most people, actually, don't even know what 4chan is...
t1_dv37x4k	1	*	Your comment started off as a joke and became gold anyway. 
t1_dv3arno	1	*	Nope
t1_dv3dul3	1	*	That first link... Such a bad reading of history.
t1_dv4hz5k	1	*	Nothing. Its your job to qualify what you read on the internet. 
t1_dv3g4pz	1	*	literally anyone can post to the donald.  some russian posting an image macro on the donald did nothing to impact the election. maybe try understanding things with logic?
t1_dv36a14	0	*	Oh good, that makes it okay then.   /s. Your point? 
t1_dv3w1xh	1	*	That people can troll on subs? This is hardly proof of anything. It wouldn't surprise me if trolls targeted this sub and any other political sub.
t1_dv3qyx6	1	*	Mostly 150kg neckbeard shut-ins who hate others because their own lives are terrible.
t1_dv3dbu5	1	*	Good. For all of those who knew this, thanks for spreading the word, and to all who knew this and didn't, fuck you.

t1_dv36uj9	1	*	Do we have the same mother? Yours sounds really familiar...
t1_dv3pa95	0	*	No one gives a shit about 4chan.  Everyone is fully aware of how god awful it is.  The only people lurking there are conspiracy theorists.
t1_dv3bo5u	1	*	As an American,  I'm with you. 
t1_dv34xd0	1	*	I know it was so weird. I remember going to the lolz and memes then somewhere along the way it became serious. 
t1_dv3oq8i	1	*	I'm surprised you know how to type 
t1_dv37mq2	1	*	They will say they didn't know and continue to allow racist memes from the usual subs to reach the front page.
t1_dv35roc	1	*	They spoof their location. 
t1_dv35kk4	1	*	Jeez, thought I slipped into /r/raisedbynarcissists

t1_dv39paq	1	*	You can make anything sound bad if you switch words around.
t1_dv3eci3	1	*	You think that by banning t_d, reddit will be helping their potential competition grow?  t_d regularly threatens to just go to 4chan, where they already have a presence.
t1_dv36zst	1	*	I wonder if one could analyse content in t_D linguisticaly to infer the cultural background of the posters
t1_dv39j79	1	*	I don't mind the memes but whenever they cite InfoWars or anything like that I start to feel embarrassed for them.
t1_dv3a7e2	0	*	whataboutism
t1_dv39m33	0	*	Well you probably should care since he really is actively trying to ruin the planet we live on. As a Canadian, I wish I didn't have to care.

t1_dtaulho	1	*	ITT: No one that understands when daylight savings time is.   I think I scrolled halfway down and your the first post that got it right. 
t1_dtaj6c9	1	*	But muh farmers who if they need extra daylight so bad could just adapt their *own* sleeping patterns...
t1_dtapv6l	0	*	Yeah because the way we change our clocks affects the earth's rotation
t1_dt9unvf	0	*	Light is not a problem in Finland. In summertimes we in fact have light 24h a day
t1_dtbb9in	1	*	Worth it. Small risk, we can't go through life avoiding every small risk.
t1_dtr5er6	1	*	you are just the next level of stupid aren't you
t1_ds3knp5	1	*	>Disappointed every time.  not sure why. it's OfficialStupidityPorn, she is a star. apparently it comes with the job because Samantha Power was a star as well.
t1_dskc7n6	1	*	Sure we have issues but I think my country is great.   Trump is a dumbass 
t1_dsl1r84	1	*	> living in shack houses, beheading each other in the street and fleeing its border by the thousands...  Yeah, that's what the whole country looks like...
t1_dsk2pkt	1	*	Those keywords are dead on  Trump President Shithole Fox
t1_dsk33ts	0	*	That's really scary.  You think that's how it works, or rather should work? 
t1_dskjkar	1	*	One could say because he is loud and stupid, but that would be too far over the edge for comfort
t1_dsl1bmt	0	*	you misspelled 'murica.
t1_dskfjxk	0	*	Whats ironic?
t1_dsjzji9	1	*	Fox isn't a sitting U.S. president.
t1_dskhevn	1	*	Finally. Someone speaking the truth. Thank you.
t1_dsjqqrp	1	*	I thought Trump would personally pay for it and collect it from Mexico later, he has genius negotiation skills or so I heard.
t1_dsl1vwz	1	*	> Isn't this the president of Mexico who was kind of a joke?  That's Enrique Pexf1a Nieto, our current president. Thankfully you guys elected Trump so you can relate.
t1_dsk34l6	1	*	/r/thathappened
t1_dskcks0	1	*	You're like the idiots who get mad at people for being intolerant of bigots.
t1_dsf34mu	1	*	They just want to guarantee a second term for Trump. 
t1_dsevu4e	1	*	If that is what they got out of the memo they shouldn't be working at google at all because their  reading comprehension sucks.
t1_dsf7lro	1	*	wtf did i just read...
t1_dsf2uin	1	*	Doesn't mean we shouldn't try. We didn't have penicillin for most of our history either but we didn't roll over for scarlet fever.
t1_dsfq5q3	0	*	I'm very liberal myself,  but read into this a little more,  you're being very reactionary and this guy has a point. Plus Google is going way overboard on their diversity rhetoric
t1_dsf3s1z	0	*	That's not evidence in the sense that it doesn't actually support the claim of discrimination against white males
t1_dsf520t	0	*	Hitler was a male heterosexual man.  
t1_dsezg69	0	*	There is nothing more disgusting than selfpity.
t1_dsf3et0	0	*	Nobody likes you too. It's mutual.
t1_dsf6ksq	1	*	If Google could be found that it took action against some employees and not others based on protected classes, then they could be found at fault.

t1_dt67qxp	0	*	How? Wont this stop the fighting? Dont the kurds have an uneasy understanding the with SAA anyway?
t1_ds4xncy	1	*	Even in America where hate speech is protected by the constitution, they draw the line at inciting violence. FB deleting those accounts is a good thing.

t1_dv2hqri	0	*	That it doesn't work?
t1_dv2cjos	1	*	[Immediately started humming it myself.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZLHsqOXFkc)

t1_ds1x6en	1	*	That'd be roughly 113 million dogecoins at the current rate. 
t1_ds7wgc0	0	*	If you want dark UK history the Thatcher years are a ~~coal pit~~ gold mine!   
t1_ds828uh	1	*	It's 'thacherite' so at the very least neo-conservatism.  Liberalism is equivocally against this barbarism, though I consider myself to have transcended above applying such labels to my morals/ethics.
t1_ds7u8c6	1	*	Stand still laddy!
t1_dtbznd3	1	*	Russia really likes bullying smaller bordering countries. If Ukraine and Georgia join NATO, its pastime will be threatened.
t1_dsyezs0	1	*	Precisely what it is. This is also the third time they're passing the same proclamation. First time was in 2014.  But yeah... world news.
t1_dsxkef6	1	*	> It also didn't break the friendship agreement they have with Russia  Care to elaborate why you think Ukraine is following the friendship agreement in any active way?
t1_dsxsr9w	1	*	Russia didn't have a large enough navy
t1_dt0apsf	1	*	Only 15 downvotes ? Russian troll centres but be sleeping today...

t1_dtraatz	0	*	If we were meant to stay connected to family we wouldn't genetically mutate every iteration. Evolve.
t1_dtskc7w	1	*	Gender politics has recently been infecting the site, I've found. 
t1_dtrms15	1	*	Just filter it down to dog memes and youre good to go
t1_dtrdfn2	1	*	Like any dopamine hacking tabloid. Garbage. 
t1_dtrasd0	0	*	Youre exactly right. I commented on a business page about a problem with their website. One of my Facebook friends that I havent seen or talked to in decades liked my post. Felt weird, man.
t1_dtrqz6u	0	*	Snapchat too. Although I don't use or like Snapchat, I'm glad that youngyins are being sliiightly more protective of their days by using a service that largely gets rid of it 
t1_dtrfi1o	1	*	It's good for organising events and sharing photos. Other than that. I really don't use it for anything else.
t1_dtrminj	1	*	This is why I don't touch the app often at all, I do like the messenger, but it's falling into the same fate.
t1_dtrbbbs	0	*	Has anyone who didn't have your number put in effort to track you down? (that you know of)
t1_dtrm3e7	1	*	Also police and employers check it now to make sure youre behaving.
t1_dtrdkdu	1	*	Yeah only use messenger, don't ever go on Facebook anymore, no point. 
t1_dtrm7fs	1	*	Move to Myanmar. I don't think they even allow political arguments there. And they like Americans, since Americans pay for the cattle prods and shit.  
t1_dtrmvjk	1	*	I'm throughly convinced that it is where all my spam mail went.
t1_dtremao	0	*	He does, thats why he bought instagram and whatsapp and alot of other shit because FB is poison. 
t1_dtrof3j	1	*	Corporations must increase profits year after year, or else you're fired.  This is when companies take it the new level of scum.
t1_dtravar	1	*	I use it to keep in touch with my buddies who are deployed. Oh and my dad. Pretty neat. 
t1_dtrhzug	1	*	But do you even talk to half of them now?
t1_dtslsw5	1	*	Of course not, don't you know Facebook is the #1 leading problem in the world? /s
t1_dtrfah8	1	*	I like Telegram. Its on everything.
t1_dtrgrdy	1	*	This is summed up in 'Filling The Void' by Marcus Gilroy-Ware. A fascinating insight into the unacknowledged affects and problems with social media. Highly recommended. 
t1_dtrih1u	1	*	My family got upset with me for shitposting. I stopped posting.
t1_dtrdt6o	1	*	Use it for events and buying car parts, everything else is just irritating.
t1_dtrenlb	0	*	>implying reddit isn't the same way  Fuck off 
t1_dtreylw	1	*	Facebook was never cool, lol!
t1_dtraomm	1	*	Ditto.
t1_dtru8aj	1	*	I also quit with my SO - seven years later we are still going strong. I was incredibly immature when we first got together and honestly Im glad I dont have to be reminded of that on Facebook. 
t1_dtrkl8p	1	*	This, and to occasionally share with, or see, far away friends or family that I otherwise wouldn't.
t1_dtrds4w	1	*	Same thing with my family. Always being asked if I saw so and so's post and they're also always talking shit about what people post. Real life is so much better. 
t1_dtr9zg3	1	*	I uninstalled it from my phone (really just disabled it since it's bloatware, thank you AT&T and/or Samsung).
t1_dtrjoqi	0	*	Life
t1_dtrm49x	1	*	**friend suggestions**   totally
t1_dtrn53u	1	*	Well, I would never post and login infrequently when I was in college so they targeted depression and loneliness ads at me hard. Fuck off, so insulting.
t1_dtrgyg4	1	*	I just use it for checking out a few events here and there. It's garbage nonetheless.
t1_dtrmri3	1	*	Exactly. And the problem is you don't keep up with them anymore, because news feed is all trash
t1_dtrbn03	1	*	That's basically the whole internet
t1_dtro9rx	1	*	Oh wow! You guys its no surprise to him. This thread is officially dead. This internet user said it wasnt a surprise to him. 
t1_dtritep	1	*	That laziness costs you so much privacy. So much.
t1_dtrb7xy	1	*	Whoa there buddy, that undermines my whole philosophy as a hedonist. Don't fuck me up by making me think about this, bro.
t1_dtrqf5q	1	*	Yup, people are echo-chambering ignorance. Not really surprised :/
t1_dtrahbq	1	*	I mean, really, FB was best back in 07. It was all downhill from there.
t1_dtrb0cl	1	*	Wow you're so brave. 
t1_dtsp50m	1	*	I stopped using it when friends started making accounts for their pets...
t1_dtrp579	1	*	Details. I don't have either. 
t1_dtrdybc	1	*	Just like reddit.
t1_dtreta7	1	*	Echo chamber for bullshit is spot on. I stopped using FB around the 2016 election because everyone was using it as a soapbox or a personal political blog.
t1_dtslnlv	1	*	Fb will also do a dripping effect on notifications, where if there's little to no activity, they will announce stupid shit about once or twice a day to keep the drip going.
t1_dtrfysb	1	*	Zuckerberg announced that he wants to change that. I am curious how that will turn out. 
t1_dtremll	1	*	Facebook was never cool.
t1_dtrh60i	1	*	Then Facebook figured out how to put ads in the visual quotes and other images.  Infuriating.
t1_dtrp5v0	0	*	Take that back! Where will I act a fool!? 
t1_dtsd2qw	1	*	If you have the FB app, just delete it. Facebook needs to know that it has to change. They'll see their users drop more and more and more
t1_dtrbdw4	1	*	People are just embarrassing themselves and tarnishing their own legacies.  Self-indulgent vanity is about the least offensive that goes on there.  It makes you feel awful about the people you like.  
t1_dtrd9d8	1	*	Fb stock is up about ~43% from this time last year. A few highly voted post on reddit doesnt decide how stocks perform.
t1_dtrpj4e	1	*	Hey did you hear of that new app that lets you know which of your friends are xenophobic?! ... 
t1_dtrbhwi	1	*	I still use it to feel.. connected.
t1_dtrji1n	1	*	when they killed msn something had to replace it... and skype has always been a piece of shit
t1_dtrsofu	1	*	Messages and Facebook event invites, that's all I use it for because I have to. I with there was a series Events app so I could just uninstall Facebook itself. 
t1_dtrsmp1	1	*	Spot on 
t1_dtrbpy3	1	*	I blame Russian bots and my mother. Been off book for a year and half.
t1_dtrlv0h	1	*	Your aunt has tagged you in a hilarious cat meme...again
t1_dtrpb89	1	*	The random videos they Auto generate about your profile such as the friendversary couldn't get anymore useless
t1_dtrld0a	0	*	I quit Facebook and took up reddit - nearly zero negativity and junk mail. Best move ever!! ufe0f
t1_dtrj5ip	1	*	Same, man! I deleted my Facebook account a while ago and last week I did the same with Instagram. I'm 27 and I was getting addicted... Imagine how unhealthy that is to teenager.
t1_dtr9tzv	1	*	He has Jarvis do that for him
t1_dtrdvfi	1	*	10% trash? My Facebook feed is 99% trash
t1_dtrabi7	0	*	you do realize facebook owns instagram right? They own 100% of the social media anyone cares about. Aka not snapchat garbage 
t1_dtrez7q	1	*	Oh god gif recipes.  This is a great comment - it really is that simple isn't it? I'm exactly the same. I want status updates and pics and thats it.  
t1_dtrlwis	1	*	Unless you're in your mid 70's I don't think you need to worry.
t1_dtrtniv	1	*	 I turned off the sound in the app on my phone.  But every so often, an advertisement suddenly has sound.  So, like if a friend posts a video= no sound.  Advertisment= SOUND    Such bullshit.
t1_dtrcsyj	1	*	> chronic narcissism  Nope, just the weekly circle jerk of anti-FB folks who refuse to comprehend how any aspect of FB could be beneficial.  
t1_dtrjrdf	1	*	Cant scam on chicks when your grandma will see you wrote nice tits on your co-workers profile. I miss MySpace 
t1_dtrowbx	1	*	*autoplays video ad about mail*  *delivers ad about recycling*  *gives ad for earplugs*   *status update on Barbras new cat not being constipated*  *ad for cat food*
t1_dtr7iuf	1	*	The narcissism was always there, we just gave it a platform.
t1_dtrqtuo	1	*	> Its become junk mail  Only worse. It was a dark day in internet history when old people learned what memes were and started misusing them. 
t1_dtrrc5z	1	*	Yup. Only use it because Im an officer in a club and its the platform used to communicate to members. 
t1_dtrogcq	1	*	Funnier than ur username tho?
t1_dtrgnd5	1	*	I never liked it except for long distance friend connection..
t1_dtrfs8l	1	*	Sending a text message or picture through text  is a lot easier and simpler than all Facebook crap. Dont know why people need to feel like their conversations and lives need to be in public display.
t1_dtrjxvj	1	*	They just did what any company does. Growth at any cost. 
t1_dtrfss0	1	*	he said, on reddit.
t1_dtr9oua	1	*	I did this too, glad I'm not the only one. Fuck, I even added a profile pic on here and I thought I'd never do that.  Oh well. I still enjoy being quasi-anonymous to the Facebook platform.
t1_dtrlca7	1	*	Aware me how
t1_dtroous	0	*	Facebook isn't what it used to be. It's not just a content sharing app. It's exactly the same as going on Reddit.
t1_dtrwlvl	1	*	Yup. Lots of hyperbole being thrown around over what may turn out to be a statistical blip.
t1_dtrf9br	1	*	Also the help X celebrate their birthday notifications when it's someone I've never even liked a post from.
t1_dtrdo6u	1	*	I have a strict no family policy and after the first year of utter shaming and bullshit they finally stopped caring.
t1_dtrfee6	1	*	Exactly. I had it in 2007 when living in Colombia and it was such a fun and playful forum for interacting with all my expat friends and coordinating events and whatnot
t1_dtrph2m	1	*	And every comment section, even on seemingly non-political posts, delves into 55 year old men calling everyone a moron (or moran, as applicable).
t1_dtrdasl	1	*	Best explanation so far
t1_dtrjfm5	1	*	Pls don't cry :)
t1_dtra2c6	1	*	I stand with you 100%!!!!!!!!!!! Were a rare breed my friend. We are a rare breed. 
t1_dtrxuug	1	*	I have vague memory of the time when facebook was about socializing and keeping in touch with friends and acquaintances. good old days...
t1_dtrdmkx	1	*	I went through last week and slimmed my friends list from 1300 people to 450 people. Still a lot but it felt great to get the people I don't care about or don't even know off of there. 
t1_dtrgktl	1	*	If you use it more you will understand it better. Start using it every day.
t1_dtrg472	1	*	It already exists, its called Facebook 
t1_dtrg0tw	1	*	What is your recommendation? Looking to switch (pretty much only messaging my girlfriend, so I can probably convince her to switch with me)
t1_dtrat3d	1	*	Go birds
t1_dtrlaid	1	*	I still get 500+ pieces of junk mail in my email a week. Doesn't matter how much crap I unsubscribe too.  Flat out don't understand how email providers make money.
t1_dtrjsn8	1	*	So now you come to the echo chamber that is Reddit. These exact same comments about Facebook are made every week here. It's just a different echo chamber.
t1_dtrvv49	0	*	You do realize there is a world beyond the internet, where people can communicate and interact with each other?
t1_dtrwji1	1	*	I wonder if this is actually a thing that's happening?
t1_dtrcrqw	1	*	> most the people I know start to lose their fucking minds during this trump epidemic   How can you not? Serious question. Its been a year and Im still wondering what is that buffoon doing there 
t1_dtrpmw7	1	*	This. I don't have Twitter, but afraid of losing contact with some people is exactly why I still have Facebook...
t1_dtr94ko	1	*	Then you got sick of all those same people you got to reconnect with.
t1_dtsdwvx	1	*	Thank you!
t1_dtrcng8	1	*	Which make this seem like more of an opening in the market than a sign of change.
t1_dtrfs5m	1	*	Agreed, they have reached the optimum levels with little room for growth left and most importantly it's not exciting anymore so people seek other options 
t1_dtrh34n	1	*	The only real reason to have a fb account these days is messenger.
t1_dtrbis8	1	*	This is so true. I stopped using it as much when I started accepting friend requests from my parents and other old people U0001f914
t1_dtrknwh	0	*	You dumb. 
t1_dtio5s5	1	*	Now you know why
t1_dsiv1sl	0	*	> to know they're gonna get butchered as soon as they step foot across  Hahahahaha oh, come on. Its like saying im going to get shot by a toddler if i go to Texas.
t1_dsj6e45	1	*	Me too!  Still have my wallet and my phone.
t1_dsigwtr	1	*	Ah yes, a T_D poster that needed to be convinced that the wall is a good idea.  Da.  Is believable.
t1_dsjo9f7	0	*	If Mexico is a country full of wonderful people, then why is it poor and crime ridden?
t1_dsjcr1g	0	*	> Any immigration control is racist!  That's a nice strawman you've built up there.
t1_dsj4fl2	1	*	One place is bad, so another place must be less bad
t1_dsiq0js	0	*	There are a lot of US citizens living there, I guess it is safe.
t1_dsiyx0s	1	*	my brother went to japan
t1_dsiwuyc	0	*	Yucatan Peninsula is good. Look for a crime map and both Campeche and Yucatan are among the safest states in the country, safer than many american cities.
t1_dsoaqhh	1	*	for some reason you are awkwardly interested in my country...I'm quite  flattered... Kudos Sudaca https://i.imgur.com/Y0CqELT.png
t1_dsj8cgc	1	*	Costa Rica baby!
t1_dsjanbj	0	*	> So Don't go to Mexico. But Any immigration control is racist!  The whole mantra of this administration has been the opposite of immigration control is racist.
t1_dsiwv9k	1	*	Yucatan Peninsula is good. Look for a crime map and both Campeche and Yucatan are among the safest states in the country, safer than many american cities.
t1_dtvww1x	0	*	Seriously. He has his fingers in every major industry inside his country and a few outside his country. Not to mention he has a US president in his pocket. 
t1_dt32i23	1	*	I thought everyone was supposed to pay their fair share.
t1_dt3as5y	0	*	More like use the tax money for domestic r&d
t1_ds570l0	1	*	These words you type, they were meant to make sense were they?
t1_duwiut7	1	*	true
t1_dtz9sz7	0	*	No, it's not 
t1_duins45	0	*	[corn straws](http://letsgogreen.biz/pages/utensils/cups.html).  They feel like plastic, but are biodegradable.   
t1_dui150b	1	*	Ma man!
t1_duhjr2x	1	*	I had the same thought as you so did a quick check and you can get bendy paper straws.
t1_duhel5v	0	*	Because dollar bills are so dirty
t1_duhu7ly	1	*	One thing at a time. Also, dolls don't quite fit the mold here. We're talking about single use plastic items like straws and bags. It's probably good if children's toys don't biodegrade very quickly. 
t1_dsmt4vr	0	*	Sorry you had to go though that.  
t1_dt8aypz	0	*	Not sure if you're being sarcastic, but a person being uneducated about medicine/health does mean they deserve to die.
t1_dt7wtmf	1	*	But you see, it's allright, because when a few people die after using this product, the rest will see that it's useless and stop buying it! Once again the  market will just regulate itself!   /s
t1_dv0maq9	1	*	There's literally no chance a 14 year old banging a hot teacher who also buys him drugs doesn't brag about it at least once to someone.
t1_dv0n1vk	1	*	Came here to link that. My co-workers will love this
t1_dt8ia00	1	*	It's updated once a year. What happened this week is that it was the week they put out the number
t1_dt8ehu3	1	*	A team of old educated people adjusted their baseless unit-less metaphor designed to fearmonger.  The older people get, the more bleak their worldview becomes. It's always 11:59:59 for someone.
t1_dt8xljk	1	*	[I think Dr Manhattan covered this pretty well](https://youtu.be/IoGi4BfFxjw?t=56)
t1_duoxsa5	0	*	Do you know am American farmer?   I know a few.. most of them sell their crops offshore because the pay is 50% to 200% better.. 
t1_dup6r8c	1	*	>Poor Americans  Nah. They voted for Trump, and they got Trump. They got what they asked for, and you can't sympathise with people for that.
t1_dupggkk	1	*	maybe stop giving massive subsidies to corn producers
t1_dup1qii	0	*	US losing a trade partner is good for US?
t1_ds7uwld	0	*	Why those two specifically?
t1_dtba5pl	1	*	the dutch did it after a russian cyber attack was launched from this very same location
t1_dtbjn20	1	*	fail. 
t1_dtb3upx	1	*	My communist friend who still has a hardon for Russia is still minimizing it and insisting the only solution would be for the Dems to go hard left.
t1_dtfekuz	0	*	>Eat shit Canada.  Didn't you read the article?  it's only available in US now
t1_dtfi0mi	1	*	And that's all well and good.  They have good reasons for choosing it.  But it's still going to cost them business, as well it should.  
t1_dt0a15c	0	*	I see your point and agree.....but wouldn't want to go full Canadian and have them move in next door. 
t1_dsf9zsr	1	*	Also a bit presumptuous. In the emotional furor of the moment, it would appear they didn't think everything all the way through.
t1_dsyj9fk	1	*	And make Pakistan pay for it?
t1_dutqkmc	1	*	blame the hamas government
t1_dsx1tan	1	*	agreed! the rats and monkeys get all the advancements while us humans get nada.
t1_dutd213	1	*	Yea it it only rose 6 trillion while Obama was in office.
t1_dspgmmn	0	*	The French, as you put it, tried to prevent Brexit as best they could. They're not exactly the ones rejecting anything.
t1_dustbfk	1	*	Now? The stank is at least a decade old, just like in WW1 and WW2, the events already happened, you're all just figuring out about it now. :))
t1_duszd2i	1	*	Not anti-corruption.  Anti-competition.  The most corrupt wins.
t1_dusxb8t	1	*	That's a pretty real possibility considering China is very deep into AI and other high tech stuff and utilizes them on a regular basis.
t1_dut7wou	1	*	this is the only logical conclusion
t1_duzaoju	1	*	Pointed because if Trump's not careful he'll get crucified.
t1_duzdoze	1	*	I am not a crook

t1_dsyw3l2	1	*	He does have a 6th grade education...

t1_dubn278	1	*	They are and they have been for decades. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bX3EZCVj2XA
t1_dubnlm2	1	*	This weird argument has been trained into them for decades by the likes of Fox News. We may as well respond with no law can fully stop murder, so why outlaw murder? 
t1_dubfojg	1	*	they want us to bicker more and be more polarized. The more domestic in-fighting there is, the harder it is for the U.S. to stand in the way of Russian ambitions.
t1_dubr4g0	1	*	Reported for botting 
t1_dubomja	1	*	Nah I'm definitely a human.
t1_dubjaby	1	*	Brings a whole new meaning to keyboard warriors 
t1_dubzfir	1	*	But what would trump do without twitter?
t1_dubl5on	1	*	Because they said so...  
t1_dubkyiq	1	*	Yeah but are they Russian tho?
t1_dubqiqk	1	*	I'm pretty concerned that this shit is on national news as well. Why are these stories about what essentially amounts to non-issue being boradcast? 
t1_dubr4r1	1	*	bot! found one guys!!  but seriously, it's not about disagreement.      they had specific criteria relating them to misinformation campaigns
t1_dudu8qw	1	*	Do you mind if i register that sub?
t1_dubsgae	1	*	Democrsts flood twitter with bots and blame russia
t1_dubqead	0	*	Lots of assumption of bias based on who's on the advisory board but no critique of the methodology. Typical low hanging fruit for small minded Trump supporters.
t1_dubmr2x	1	*	The dangerous part about that is when people start to believe anyone who disagrees with them online must be a shill or bot or whatever.
t1_dublngr	0	*	AMerica is already divided and has been for decades, why blame russia for that??
t1_duboqx0	0	*	If they disagree with them, they're Russian bots
t1_duc3k4l	1	*	shilling for logic eh
t1_duc2iy3	1	*	they support one party, but because they are easy to manipulate. It takes a mass shooting for democrats to agree on something, for a little while at least.
t1_dublvgv	1	*	thought this would be a link to a certain sub
t1_dubozpo	1	*	I totally agree with you *bleep bloop*
t1_dubv8x3	1	*	Are you talking about Russia or the United States?
t1_dubncum	1	*	why are most of your posts about russia hysteria?  
t1_dubpxtq	1	*	Good luck, for the majority of people probably solely get their news from Facebook or Twitter.
t1_dubj4cc	0	*	Trump is literally in power right now. Thinking censorship of Russians is somehow a threat doesn't follow logically at all.
t1_duc2w5l	1	*	The chair was a plant!
t1_dubffsj	1	*	Says the Russian troll
t1_dubic56	1	*	You know Russia also supported BLM too, right? http://money.cnn.com/2017/09/27/media/facebook-black-lives-matter-targeting/index.html
t1_dubl2de	1	*	Are you sarcastic or delusional? It's hard to tell.
t1_dubr3th	1	*	Probably because they are proxied through Russian servers 
t1_dubqv9a	1	*	Any account they don't agree with 
t1_dubnrvl	1	*	If they say libtards
t1_dubo203	1	*	How much does a shill make? Strikes me as an expensive way to astro turf. Assuming the shill has more education than your run of the mill bot jockey. 
t1_dubp6o7	1	*	The goal is the same as every wedge issue always has been: create and deepen divisions other than the central division. The only societal division that matters. Working class and ruling class.
t1_duba7wj	0	*	When the agenda is attempting to prevent the same tragedy from happening yet again in a country where that tragedy happens way more often than any comparable country...
t1_dubqiq2	1	*	Considering how abysmal their engagement numbers on confirmed accounts, I dont think they even know how to gain traction. A bot that get retweeted twice isnt gonna do jack.
t1_dubol1d	0	*	What are you trying to imply?
t1_dubn17u	0	*	They don't have a clue, it's just bullshit
t1_dubns9j	1	*	Then they would be supporting a side, wouldn't they?    I kinda get what you're saying but...How do you support a policy for division?  It's not like succeeding from the union is on the ballot.  
t1_dublm1x	1	*	Unless, like me, you don't upvote anything.
t1_dudk7df	1	*	Any dissenting opinion counter to that of the echo chamber is labeled a russian bot.  
t1_dubr7nw	1	*	If your not with us, you're against us. 
t1_duboot0	1	*	Slavic squatting robots.
t1_dubmgv7	1	*	Woah, relevant user name.
t1_dubuo44	1	*	posting patterns, timings, locations?
t1_dubqypw	1	*	They must be semiautomatic quantum computing bots
t1_duc9w92	1	*	It's almost as if the two party system were designed to maintain control within parameters.
t1_dubp4hm	1	*	They dont. Click bait ad revenue title. Twitter even said its to hard to figure out in a hearing.
t1_dubkckk	1	*	They don't. The site says they have no idea.
t1_duc4a03	0	*	It will be a lot easier for Russia to take over when weve already shot each other dead first 
t1_dubovvx	1	*	You hit it on the head, it's about division and radicalization.
t1_dubqzam	1	*	Let me guess your subs.... kek
t1_dubyprl	0	*	>this is trick  found the russian
t1_dubdpl7	0	*	This is called Earth. 
t1_dubn58l	0	*	lol dont you mean  i hate blacks
t1_dubqa09	1	*	Why the fuck would Russia care if we're armed if they never plan to invade?  However, they're highly interested in causing chaos in the US.
t1_dubq28s	0	*	Umm maybe because a divided America is a weak America?  They'll never have to invade us, we'll destroy ourselves eventually.
t1_dubqyjy	0	*	how gullible do you have to be to swallow the shit that Trump feeds the trash?
t1_dubtx0e	1	*	A political lobbyist think tank. Sure is a 'good source of information'. Next up we have the heritage foundation and a new American century.
t1_dubvgrl	1	*	because queen hillary's campaign team blamed russians.
t1_dubwgum	0	*	Yes.  I'm sure that AR-15 will come in handy when Predator drones are flying overhead.  This is a bullshit excuse. You're bringing a gun to a drone/tank/missile fight.
t1_dubnius	0	*	Probably because those don't exist
t1_dubotwf	0	*	I can actually answer that one!   PS:[ It's not foolproof](https://youtu.be/64gTjdUrDFQ?t=40s).
t1_dubnac3	1	*	Yup, basically everything is equivalent and we should all stop worrying about the bots. Both sides have bad people, bad shooters, bad victims.
t1_dudu3bf	1	*	So what happened? You guys accidentally voted Xi as your President?
t1_dubjah3	1	*	because russian bots are cheaper to buy, china has a large manufacturing base, russia is just full of unemployed engineers
t1_dubm5ri	1	*	Did you read the article?
t1_dubnmi0	1	*	Goddammit. The bots have gone too far when they infiltrate my baby elephant gifs. 
t1_duc07kw	1	*	Wait until AI gets better at language. They won't even need to hire people to do this. There will be no way to tell who's human and who isn't. (We're going to need a new internet)
t1_dubjke3	1	*	Probably. Its about increasing internal discord
t1_dubotfa	1	*	Pro gun = bots
t1_duc22jc	1	*	If an opinion is different than yours than obviously it's not another person who intelligently arrived at a different viewpoint but an evil Russia bot.
t1_dubmte5	1	*	> If you spend more than 5 minutes on Reddit today you have 100% have seen, read and likely agreed with a bot or shill.  Don't assume we're all as pathetic as conservatives.
t1_dubwjlh	1	*	It's easy and fairly cheap to manufacture or promote a narrative on social media from anywhere in the world. That's not something that has any historical precedent.
t1_ducjexv	1	*	That's easy.  If you see a bunch of people you dont agree with on the internet, then they're Russian shills.
t1_dubnul2	1	*	The comments disagree with what the mainstream want you to think.  You're a bot for even asking.
t1_duc491i	1	*	At this point social media is pretty much worthless for meaningful discussions of anything.
t1_dubiaxb	1	*	Russia's motive is to sow further division between the American population and to ensnare more twitter users into following pro-Kremlin accounts.  
t1_dubojtw	1	*	no, they want america fighting amongst themselves so that nothing gets done and they can go about doing whatever they want without the only superpower that could do anything about it noticing. 
t1_dub8bfk	1	*	They're not - they want you to carry on killing eachother, arguing about it, and spending huge amounts of money on weapons that would otherwise be superfluous.
t1_dubf87n	1	*	How do you know about my congressman Keith Rothfus? I didn't know he was on reddit, but 100% shill. And most likely bot as well.
t1_dubpgcc	1	*	Only Russian bots would disagree with the American second amendment and its toll on lives.
t1_duby4mk	1	*	MSM tirelessly works for people exactly like you. They did it twice with Iraq, and since it's worked - they continued. Useful idiots as the name itself implies -  are useful
t1_ducmggx	0	*	I like big bots and I cannot lie.  -SirShillAlot, probably.
t1_dubrqxz	1	*	It's propaganda, it's not real.
t1_dsapo35	0	*	I fail to see how it isn't just fascism. Not the Hitler kind, more like the Mussolini kind.
t1_du1b6vk	1	*	In the US (where microbeads have been banned since 2014), companies did exactly that and switched to silica and walnut shells in their products.
t1_du0xujj	0	*	Too dense. It would sink to the bottom and shake before use is too hard a sell in these lazy days. Walnut shells - OK, but then What about my margins,
t1_du0qrvg	0	*	Try just fucking water 
t1_dsjm0yl	1	*	Did you even read the article?
t1_dtum6wr	0	*	By authority of the galactic senate you are here by under arrest
t1_dsxcpeb	1	*	Considering his opposition leader just mysteriously died in a US helicopter, perhaps that's why he's feeling so good about a run.
t1_dswxux1	1	*	I can't quite get over the fact that he's nicknamed The Crocodile.   You don't get called that by being a nice and peaceful diplomat.
t1_dsnoyad	1	*	It's very green actually. Just not with trees. 
t1_dsmvnh7	1	*	Boooooooo :)
t1_dsmj120	1	*	Roads are a local authority issue. If you're upset about potholes, moan to your council 'cos nobody else gives a fuck.
t1_dsmiy2s	1	*	That would be nice, but HS2 ain't that.
t1_duhqclb	1	*	probably easier to just whitelist the good ones....
t1_dtl57b2	1	*	>What the fuck is going on over there?  Corruption.
t1_dtl0qe7	0	*	I don't understand what will be the harm of this ?
t1_dtlb5ry	0	*	[Since we've already stopped eating vegetables](https://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm581389.htm), I guess we'll just consume everything via IV
t1_dtkvklu	0	*	It's not the country dummy. It's the food industry giants outsourcing the raising of chicken in India.
t1_dtku5ju	0	*	Are you kidding? India is the pharma capital of the world. If *they* banned exports to the US and EU, *we'd* be in trouble.
t1_dtl636k	0	*	This whole world is for profit or pay to win. Capitalism is slowly killing the world and we're all blaming various problems and leaders. When the entire system has to be scrapped and started over.
t1_dtkyqxi	1	*	No it doesn't. The more these drugs are used, the higher the risk of bacteria becoming resistant to it which affects everyone, not just meat-eaters.
t1_dtkwmvm	0	*	Crowded, inhuman conditions. Same as American factory farming, which is also responsible for overuse of antibiotics (resulting in drug-resistant bacteria).
t1_dtl0qjg	0	*	They're poor. We're malicious and stupid for doing nothing about it.
t1_dtkmar9	0	*	You realise that bacteria won't judge if you are a vegan or not right?  You gonna die from it too.
t1_dtkunuz	1	*	Greenland, not Iceland. Just make sure it's not the place where it starts.
t1_dtli1wt	1	*	I am not sure about that but you can buy certified organic meat, or better yet buy from a small local producer that you trust.
t1_dtkzv6f	0	*	What will kill us first?  * Nuclear war  * Suffocation  * Bacterial pandemic
t1_dtkxkot	1	*	We wouldn't have this problem if their farms had better staph.
t1_dtl2ife	1	*	We already can't get them to stop shitting in the street, how are we supposed to convince them of this?
t1_dtkvlc0	0	*	No I like chicken 
t1_dtl6gw5	1	*	Shkreli method. 
t1_dtl8xjb	1	*	Could still eat bugs.
t1_dtlbwrc	1	*	I mean there were people living and reproducing before the advent of antibiotics. Just a bit shorter on average.
t1_dtkokbk	0	*	You do realize one of the biggest sources of bacterial outbreaks is unclean vegetables right? 
t1_dtkz0hl	0	*	The difference is that a plague doesn't fuck with other parts of nature (at least not directly)
t1_dtl665j	1	*	India is quite capable of producing drugs themselves, which is why they do so for most major drugs. 
t1_dtm02mg	1	*	Come on Aduck Chickler, we don't want a poultry holocaust.   (actually we do please start killing them all)
t1_dtktgrd	1	*	All well and good to say this, as long as you realize you may be one of the people who dies because of a drug resistant superbug.
t1_dtl3rcs	1	*	Ironic. He could save other countries from death, but not himself.
t1_dtl3rc6	1	*	I attribute my overall good health to years of manual farm labor and exposure to many kinds of poop.  Jokes on you city slickers, with your municipal water and hand sanitizers!
t1_dtky2o1	1	*	In their attempt to keep chickens alive.... for a short while.
t1_dtl7gqh	0	*	This is how my civic teacher started class
t1_dtkxxoi	1	*	As part of his new health care plan it's a win/win!

t1_dtkyngy	1	*	We have money to make right NOW!
t1_dtlk8xs	1	*	Kill them before they kill you lol
t1_dtkw4ou	1	*	Contagion is one of my favorite movies. Also the most terrifying movie Ive ever seen.
t1_dtm5863	1	*	And people bitch at hippies for buying chickens that aren't fed all this bullshit. JFC
t1_dtl05zd	1	*	Well son, your sisters name was Sue.
t1_dtkopez	0	*	They might not be selling those, but Colistin is still being used in US and EU markets as of now.   The use of critical antibiotics is being phased out however in the next 2 years.
t1_dtkul1y	1	*	I believe it was a somewhat obsolete antibiotic, which made it a go to for when none others worked since it was rarely used and thus bacteria had no resistance to it.
t1_dtl0zs3	0	*	Fuck me for being naturally intended to include some meat in my diet.
t1_dtlur4u	1	*	Unless you discover a new and more powerful antibiotic? No. 
t1_dtki2bu	0	*	Or we could stop supporting this shit by not buying it
t1_dtkrmzf	0	*	Now this is fascinating. To my understanding these can be designed to only target specific bacterial cultures as well, preventing damaging your gut biome.
t1_dtkrz15	1	*	It seems like we deserve to be wiped out. A hard reset on humanity has been a long time coming.
t1_dtkumio	1	*	At least we'll get that population spike under control.  It'll probably reduce the CO2 levels. yay
t1_dtku6ib	1	*	Daoism here I come!
t1_dtld27z	1	*	You damned dirty yuppy..../s 
t1_dtl098o	1	*	> organic chicken  Oh the irony of using 'organic' organic products. What have we done to this planet?!?!  
t1_dtld8k0	1	*	I am mind blown that you are the first person Ive read to suggest this. 
t1_dtl734h	1	*	Just like they do with global warming. Im sure it will happen eventually, once half the human population has died of famine or plague
t1_dtknmth	0	*	Probably not, export/import costs and all that. Doesn't mean that anti-biotic resistant bacteria won't make it over to the US.
t1_dtkza7w	1	*	This is the entire capitalist system. Corporate owned media is hardly going to mention this in their daily bulletin
t1_dtl2auf	1	*	Welcome to late stage capitalism!
t1_dtldw7b	1	*	Yep. This is the same story as PCBs from Monsanto where they fucked over the health of Anniston, AL for profits. Because its so much cheaper to dump poison into a river than to properly dispose of it.
t1_dtl0htt	0	*	China is dirty, but its a different kind of dirty. I put money on India. thats more biologically dirty
t1_dtl3b6p	0	*	It's not really hurting the chickens. Just our entire ecosystem.
t1_dtlx9yg	1	*	> The greatness of a nation can be judged by the way its animals are treated.  India is a great nation then - free healthcare for the chickens! :)
t1_dtl0kdz	1	*	And then you get infected with the resistant bacteria by shaking someones hand.
t1_dtmc06g	1	*	animal agriculture is already the leading cause of ocean dead zones, deforestation, habitat destruction and species extinction.   Now we can add the birth of a super plague 
t1_dtkuy9y	0	*	So I guess it's just a lottery of who gets to live through this apocalypse and who doesn't?
t1_dtle5ek	1	*	Too bad only one nation isn't playing plague inc. Every one is playing to win
t1_dtky3xd	0	*	But that carbon footprint....
t1_dtl5tmy	1	*	once upon a time, far far away, in a little place called imaginationland 
t1_dtl23oz	1	*	$$$$$$$$$$$
t1_dtkw274	1	*	Similar practices are found in US poultry as well. Non-necessary antibiotics are pretty much par of the course with factory farms.
t1_dtkxl7v	1	*	Without lube.
t1_dtlkeib	0	*	Thats what Capitalism gets you. Alas, you have discovered another one of the many ways Capitalism will unravel civilization. 
t1_dukrtd0	0	*	This is a de facto ban on all articles from the NY Times and Washington Post. They have significant international reporting. In fact, the Washington Post is in the banner of this subreddit
t1_du0kyu3	1	*	When a guy ruthlessly criticizes other people's appearances, his own shortcomings become fair game. Has nothing to do with politics, the reality of the situation speaks for itself.
t1_dut32dq	1	*	Unfortunately Merkel will stay

t1_dv3h5c7	0	*	Same with Boeing.
t1_dthjome	0	*	The first dossier was fake. It was paid for by the clinton foundation and the dnc. CNN even reported on it. Look it up. For none of the claims could evidence be found.
t1_dthypab	1	*	Sounds Russian, might be a lie.
t1_dti1efx	1	*	How do you fight it?
t1_dtj9vt1	0	*	Well, when your party is particularly corrupt, there tends to be more info on that corruption.

t1_dthnhey	1	*	Also remember: the CIA and other government agencies use our media for propaganda purposes. This is on the record.
t1_dthfxrd	1	*	True, now let's see who had one message these weeks, and who bombarded you with a new headline every minute...
t1_dthszze	1	*	Which is probably why so much fake bullshit is propagated against Trump constantly. Sadly the people up voting this think otherwise. 
t1_dti3bry	0	*	how are you moderate? you constantly post on t_d in favor of trump and constantly call the left libtards and the like 
t1_dthj3o1	1	*	If you think you're an outsider to this you're sorely mistaken my friend. This crisis is going to continue to have international consequences for decades to come
t1_dthior2	1	*	Unlike the EU because you have your shit sewn up.  I fail to see how we have a crisis if Trump didn't collude. 
t1_dthgh5j	0	*	Jr.'s e-mails are proof of collusion in the public domain.  They may or may not constitute a *crime*, but that's not what you're asking for.
t1_dthplwz	1	*	This also applies to the media narratives that we've been bombarded with.
t1_dthd73h	1	*	Couldn't you say that about articles themselves too? Or anything that's prevalent on the news?

t1_dthnkcm	1	*	Great edit 2! While I vaguely knew the idea, it's good to see it written out.  It can be hard to figure out why different authority figures would do different things, however.
t1_dthn7hp	1	*	The people in charge of this know theyre wrong, but they just dont care. They just want more power are crush any opposition. This is fascism in the making.

t1_dthi07n	1	*	Because there's this wonderful thing called evidence that needs to actually exist.
t1_dth5gbv	1	*	Well when the truth comes out, and the losing party of the last election, has more collusion than the current sitting president does then it will go away.
t1_dthrhuj	1	*	Thats exactly what it is too. Entertainment.

t1_dt4vfh3	1	*	End the Global Cannabis Prohibition!
t1_dt51olq	1	*	It doesn't work in a democratic country, China weeded out drugs,... alongside with sellers and users, and people who are troubled. But then again that's actually not healing the tree but uprooting it!

t1_dt4q7bv	1	*	But but but the DEA like to criminalize people and what about private prisons. Have a heart for those effected!!!!
t1_dt50cfg	1	*	It's progress, Greece is highly conservative on drug issues, so getting them to at least see that weed has medical benefits is a first step.
t1_dt4u6qw	1	*	Another U.S. state legalized for recreational just yesterday. It's been decriminalized in one for nigh 50 years. The legalization sweep in the u.s. is going to cause a trend in Europe now.

t1_dtvwf1j	1	*	talk to your fellow workers about unionizing. Unionizing can be completely democratic and worker run. Look into the IWW
t1_dtvy94n	0	*	You need to surround yourself with different people. Fighting for worker's rights is important and such a win for the IGM makes these policies likely to spill over to other industries.
t1_dtw3m6h	0	*	Well the Chinese *do* make our steel uncompetitive, but that's a completely separate issue usually involving unpatriotic companies that only care about their bottom line 
t1_dtw2gw5	1	*	It is? Search HDI. I think you meant you wish unions were stronger in America? 
t1_dtvzkqa	1	*	Yes, but they produce twice in that time, so that is the equivalent of 56 American work hours per week.  
t1_dtvva3r	1	*	That makes sense for Germany with such a low birth rate. You either have to take in a lot of immigrants or increase your birth rate if you want the economy to grow.

t1_dtzujg6	1	*	Which science does he think is fake?  On what basis do you assert that he 'hates gays'  On what premise do you suppose that his or any other religion is fake?
t1_dtz8w9p	1	*	> but to at least open a dialogue is important  Yeah I'm sure Pence will change his mind after meeting a gay figure skater, after decades of bigotry and hatred.
t1_du00g32	1	*	He said he would be open to a conversation afterwards, he probably does want to tell him exactly how he feels, but has rather more important things to concentrate on.

t1_dumcd7g	1	*	Massive understatement tbf
t1_dtey5n1	1	*	The head of hijab police has the same name as someone I kkow. Poor guy stuck in background check for US visa for two years now.
t1_dtewin4	1	*	There is a verse that suggests it. Its not clearly outlined though. Most of is creation of different cultures and religious leaders.

t1_dtgbt3e	1	*	This is good news.
t1_dtewj5x	1	*	What, you don't think fighting men who spread their legs an extra foot on the train is real feminism? What about freely walking in high-heeled shoes?

t1_dtewbgu	1	*	Zero mention of the Iran women trying to move away from the hijab from the pink pussy hats, me too hashtag or the Grammy hate fest last night.   
t1_dtez8fm	1	*	That was very well written. 
t1_dtf974w	1	*	Why not Mexico?  Some celebrities in the US said they could move to Canada if Trump was elected. But it was always Canada, never Mexico, that's odd. 
t1_dtf68m9	1	*	Did they have a march?
t1_dteympw	1	*	Using male anatomy metaphor is demeaning and takes away from the point she trying to make in a male dominated society.  But I agree with what your trying to express.U0001f44d

t1_dtf0yd5	1	*	Exactly what the fucking Mullahs need now, more Martyrs.
t1_dteycxj	1	*	Yep, bad PR for the womans march too. But I still think they will double down on the hijabs.  People here are acting as if a bunch of women in the US didnt just wear hijabs as a feminist symbol.

t1_du2ctfx	1	*	Jail is for poor people.

t1_du28c1n	1	*	They do have consent. Just not yours
t1_du2a3xr	1	*	Probably. Same happened to me out of nowhere one day. I call them back and the numbers are either disconnected or wont even connect at all.
t1_du293hg	1	*	Not if you're a Republican, because Republicans just suspended the Equifax probe.
t1_du293hd	1	*	Nah, honestly, right now would be a good time to buy Equifax stocks they will take a tiny bit on the market but we are yet again at a too big to fail situation. Look at the bright side I guess?

t1_dus5h3y	1	*	I don't think it's foreign interference to have an opinion of another leader.

t1_ds117i4	1	*	She might be branded as one with a hot iron there.
t1_ds11jb4	0	*	Nice straw man. The point is that women should have a right to choose what they put on themselves. One thing thats empowering to one woman may be oppressive to another.

t1_dsevdzl	0	*	I've always know it as a hashtag back into the 90s, long before twitter was around. Is calling is a pound an American thing?

t1_duwoxvs	1	*	That's exactly why Quebec honored what was promised to the doctors in 2007. It's not like the PM just woke up and thought *hey a raise for doctors would be nice!*.
t1_duwktr9	1	*	Sounds like a good idea. We have the highest healthcare costs in the world with competitive outcomes. 
t1_duwtmq6	1	*	And their work environment is stressful as fuck too. The pay has to be high.
t1_duwosii	1	*	Also, Quebec is one of the poorer provinces. Meaning we should not pay our doctors more than the Canadian average, as our economy is below the average.

t1_duizwuz	1	*	Seriously! Did you watch the video? Legitimate terror and trauma
t1_dul4fpa	1	*	On top of that, officers dabbing rather than saluting. It is a comedy commercial spun by western sources for propaganda. And sadly, this board eats it up en masse.

t1_duj2g4a	1	*	There's little difference between that and what we see here with anti-refugee rhetoric.  It's the same bullshit just in a different wrapper.

t1_dsv1gvx	1	*	The funny thing is that mass low-skill migration actually hurts minorities, which, on average, tend to rely on these low-skilled jobs.
t1_dsutuiu	1	*	Your challenge is stupid. Thats like going up to a woman and arguing about feminism.
t1_dsvchxa	1	*	Poem written to raise money for a statue. We had worse checks than this on immigration when that was written are you saying we should go back to the days of Ellis island

t1_dsuqo21	1	*	Locking the front door to your house and locking up your car and taking your keys with you does not make you a racist. 
t1_dsuumhz	0	*	We also have more than enough high-skilled citizens in need of work. So why should we take either?
t1_dsv2h1r	1	*	Oh shit, this is so powerful and to the point it hurts

t1_dsv5yfy	1	*	He doesn't care if you think he's racist he cares about jobs for low skilled workers. There shouldnt be visas for low skilled workers in the first place.

t1_dsv15r1	1	*	Eh no? What does this have to do with racism? 
t1_dsurnlm	0	*	> maybe it was actually kind of warranted.  I don't see how some people abusing the visa system warrants fucking over everyone from a specific country.

t1_dsuwljz	1	*	these attempts to deflect and dismiss for the mango hate trumpet are getting worse.

t1_dsv87gn	1	*	Lol this is nothing new for anyone on a visa. They all do it, Trump's wife did it. If you came here from a less desirable country, wouldn't you want to stay?

t1_dsuqjn4	0	*	And many who don't want the jobs.
t1_dsuunbs	1	*	I don't really see what was racist about trump's haiti countries. The country *is* kind of a shithole, isn't it?
t1_dsv04nd	0	*	He didnt bar low skilled workers. He barred low skill workers from Haiti.  Thats significantly different.
t1_dsusc99	1	*	You're delusional. We've got a huge lack of blue collar workers considering the last generation who did it a lot is retiring. 
t1_dsutbcs	1	*	Nope, it's just terrorizing more marginalized people who are already in desperate, shitty situations because they didn't win the born into privilege birth lottery.

t1_dsuzkjl	1	*	Those people are needed to make Haiti great again
t1_dsuto1e	1	*	Firstly, yes we do. Espcially legal ones and or skilled ones. Most americans simply can't/won't work in agriculture and it has resulted in whole feed simply rotting on the vine. 
t1_dsuqqa0	0	*	Haiti was successful when France had control? What percent did it account for? What was their export? Interesting. 
t1_dsv63da	1	*	That amounts to 24 people a year
t1_dsv25fy	1	*	But it the leftist media that is reporting it. Otherwise, only a few Haitians would know about it. 
t1_dsurppg	1	*	Surprise, the island routinely fucked up by earthquakes and hurricanes is, in fact, fucked up.   What's gained by letting a few million people just get fucked up? 
t1_dsust8c	1	*	This is not a POTUS decision.
t1_dsuz1dd	1	*	No, they don't. Japan has a whole host of problems.

t1_dsuwdoe	1	*	Wait Puerto Ricans need a visa? Or do you mean they need a program to help them get to and find seasonal jobs?
t1_dsv8gbh	0	*	Because it's filled with racist degenerate alt right shit birds, but there are still better jobs. Obviously.
t1_dsvb1kf	1	*	But who cares about that, I'm just here for the Fuck Trump train.
t1_dsusikq	1	*	This is actually a completely non-issue but just looks terrible because of the comments Trump has made recently.
t1_dsv3ue1	0	*	And those Americans are unemployed because they refuse to work hard labor jobs and/or work for shit pay. We NEED mexican immigrants n shit to fill the shit jobs, contrary to what idiots believe.

t1_dv1ztxc	1	*	Kinda surprised they didn't add a religious spin to it.
t1_dsowmhs	1	*	Bullshit projects are so, because theyre used as favours for developer buddies who paid for the pollies campaign into parliament. 
t1_dsoaqvs	0	*	If everyone stuck to the speed limit in California, we'd be stuck in traffic for half the day.   Instead we should enforce passing lane rules. Keep the slow cars and trucks in the right. 
t1_du5mbtl	1	*	Ya almost had me. Well done.

t1_dtjks2s	1	*	Those damn Make Iran 1960s Modern Again bots!
t1_dtjpxd3	1	*	Yea. Iranian women like to be called dames.
t1_dtk3jfl	1	*	Rubbish. No one would say she is bigoted for choosing to take off her own hijab.  The point is, no one should be made to wear/not wear them. Which is why Iran's law is shitty.
t1_dubt7ru	1	*	I'm also over here, like, WTF?

t1_dux6dca	0	*	At least dispose of the bipartisan system. A system of purely independent representatives makes cohesive progress very difficult

t1_duw7kmf	1	*	I know that bro
t1_dsgksyt	1	*	Read the article. 
t1_dtc69mq	0	*	Yeah he's almost max lvl. At that point he can start competing in US politics for access to some of the rarest loot in the game 
t1_dtbuium	1	*	>wholesomeness   Lol we see the videos of life in Russia and the everyday corruption was on full display at the Olympics facilities.  Wholesome is not the first word that comes to mind.
t1_dtbvduf	0	*	Putin is a weak opportunist. When the new Soviet Union inevitably forms, his head will be on a spike.

t1_dtcjiqu	0	*	He'd probably grab the brides pussy if she were near, since he loves to sleep with 'friends' wives.  He's still a heartless nazi-aligned idiot that may yet still contribute to ww3 starting.
t1_dsa8u6z	1	*	I think Bear is just some guy willing to get paid to do crazy shit the real experts tell the producers to make him do.
t1_dsamrwz	1	*	Are you a vegan?
t1_dsa55d4	1	*	I didn't even have to read the whole first sentence to know where this comment was going
t1_ds9t9c2	1	*	What? Mind blown!
t1_ds9mv60	0	*	Yea, I hunt, I kill animals and eat them. But I don't do it for a shot on a scripted TV show. Thats fucked
t1_ds9wyxt	0	*	Heaven forbid people eat a squirrel. 
t1_dsaawn6	1	*	What makes it okay to kill a pig or a turkey for pleasure or profit?
t1_dsa7ypm	0	*	Don't see the problem if they eat the thing. Basically anyone complaining about this who isn't a vegetarian is a hypocrite. 
t1_ds9z0gr	1	*	Yeah fuck that other guy! 
t1_dsa0ouq	0	*	not the ones who know him.
t1_dsa5axj	1	*	Surprised this isnt higher.   As long as the animals were consumed people should have any issue with this. 
t1_dsa61x5	1	*	Reality TV is full of shit. This is why I never watch them or believed any of them.
t1_ds9yyqi	0	*	I bet David Attenborough eats meat
t1_dsa0wjd	1	*	I like the island...
t1_ds9zlo3	1	*	Dont you have better things to do in life?
t1_dsa8mxr	1	*	I don't consider it good but it isn't inherently bad. Hunting shows are pretty popular. 
t1_dsa14w6	1	*	Grylls is an Anglican. 
t1_dsa3r9j	1	*	Grills (I know it's spelt wrong) is still an Ex SAS operative. He is a badass, but his shows are more entertainment than actual advice
t1_ds9zchi	1	*	Ray Mears shows are all about how lovely it is to be in the wilderness. That's why he doesn't make the bazillions that he could. He respects nature and actually likes it. His books are a treat. 
t1_dsa4i3z	1	*	Okay
t1_ds9y3ka	1	*	Never heard of that guy but Les Stroud   is the real deal. He'd out survive bear anywhere 
t1_dsa56zd	0	*	I mean, why do we watch any show that isn't a documentary?  Edit: sorry documentary was probably a bad example.
t1_dsaa8n0	1	*	No. His problem is that they're being hunted FOR the camera. 
t1_dsa6au5	1	*	Because it's a show, it has producers which dictate what happens and knows what people want to see. He's an entertainer, you got to see past the show.
t1_ds9w6m1	0	*	The real expect is Dick Proenneke
t1_ds9y7jq	0	*	He is a vegetarian. Moron.
t1_dsa6hb0	1	*	It's such a crazy double-standard. I don't understand how people don't realize how hypocritical they're being.
t1_dsa2svz	1	*	Which end is the ass end? 
t1_ds9z8tn	1	*	If they want to show real survivors they should interview war refugees from Syria.

t1_ds9wym8	0	*	I am sure he opposes other things, too, which - for practical purposes - he may not restate every time he adds one more. 
t1_dsa71b8	1	*	I agree 100%. David just films animals killing other animals. The way nature intended.
t1_dsagkst	1	*	Well, the man has made a career of nature documentaries, so maybe he's more interested in animals and stuff than kiddy fiddlers.
t1_ds9ysn7	1	*	*Eh hem* Mors Kochansky. 
t1_ds9rhv0	1	*	Some people do and get called names like 'vegan'.
t1_dsa9rcl	1	*	I'm with you, I'd love to put my fist though grylls's face 
t1_ds9z76p	0	*	How is it different from every movie that has that disclaimer and yet the provided catering serves meat? Traditionally killing for food is not considered harming
t1_dsa37pf	1	*	Yup. He really turned his life around.
t1_ds9xawl	0	*	Or Les Stroud.
t1_dsa1iff	1	*	Most people that complain think, as your example, mice are cute/spiders not,  therefore mouse cruel to kill and spider fair game. Sad but true. Cute live.
t1_ds9yysu	1	*	The Island is a great show, though. And Bear really just does the voiceover. 
t1_ds9xd08	0	*	It wasnt the disclaimer printed in plain English during the show?
t1_dsif9zs	0	*	ummm... so are you gonna stop Georgia from subsidising studios then or....?
t1_dsi3kxe	0	*	Just point the snow blower south, eh. 
t1_dsiljla	1	*	Party pooper.
t1_dsiaoxi	1	*	Tom Hortons. Heh. Troll perfection.
t1_ds58uam	1	*	So you ignore the carnage happening in Syria at the hands of Iran but you still manage to point out Yemen, how hypocritical of you.
t1_ds57cam	0	*	> mossad/cia circus  Oh yes, moon of alabama...that totally sounds like a trustworthy and bonafide news source. I saw geocities pages 20 years ago that looked better than that. Jesus.
t1_ds5njgi	1	*	That was made in 2018? Im not convinced. The zoboomafoo page from 2001 looks better lmao 
t1_durusll	0	*	Because that's the important point here, yeah?  /s
t1_dus4r57	0	*	I want to believe you're legit, but MY interaction with 'seasonal migrant workers' tells me you're not. 
t1_dust85w	1	*	This happened in Germany during the summer, bodies liquefied and the parked trailer was found by smell and blood leaking out of it. It wasn't pretty.
t1_dtnt5v8	1	*	it's sweet tar sand oil, the most polluting hydrocarbon source in the world
t1_dukkfyg	0	*	Ah, thats Warlord.
t1_dsajfen	1	*	The dotard probably will not even finish four years and this stupid wall should not even begin construction.

t1_dsh5lri	1	*	lovely comment, full of inspiring nuance.

t1_dtdgamg	0	*	So they didn't try to sell state secrets to a fake Chinese company? Is that what you're saying?
t1_dtfi9ci	1	*	The only way to stop such rampant corruption is to execute those traitors in public.  
t1_dtdgu3r	0	*	Is it still treason if you wanted to commit treason but were too incompetent to do it properly? 
t1_dtdsxf6	1	*	Kiss my lower Europe!
t1_dtefzv0	1	*	i am the senate
t1_dtegoom	1	*	What if I told you this was propaganda to distract you from the crimes the dnc has committed in the last 10 years with the employees of the justice department ? 
t1_dtdmm2z	0	*	If they just gave the information to the people, how on earth would they be able to sell it to anybody?
t1_dte0205	0	*	Nope. But nothing stopping these chaps from blagging it and pretending they had info for a price. Not as though the Chinese (or any other buyer) could tell if they were being sold real intel or a pup.
t1_dtmsic8	1	*	Undermining allies is his job.
t1_dtmrgwr	1	*	Scouse is a close second.
t1_dtn2r6y	1	*	Well, now in the authors defense leaking a story to Yahoo news then using the ensuing article to help you get a FISA warrant could very well be a British spying method. 
t1_dtmqvf8	1	*	I noticed amazon selling their Alexas in bulk. Like buy 6 get 1 free!! $100 off!!! Gee I wonder why??
t1_dt8v8pj	0	*	Why would the other member nations bother now that they have moved on without the United States?
t1_duhehnn	1	*	If he makes 27years
t1_duhaprx	1	*	Probably similar to probation, or house arrest. 
t1_duhbfrg	0	*	For those who didn't read the article, what this person is quoting is in addition to his sentence. His sentence is 27 years in prison.
t1_duhcx4e	0	*	Something something we should have armed veterans protecting our schools something something

t1_dubgsia	1	*	Spot on 
t1_duaj59m	0	*	So you're holding Japan up as a great place and criticising folk vote wanting to be like it?  That is one very confusing post. I'm not sure even you can get the gist of it. 
t1_dua5olb	0	*	how so? I hope you dont mean Pearl Harbour...bc it would mean you know nothing about why it happened...
t1_duaauiv	1	*	Trump lowered my taxes, so my vote already made me more money. I dont give a shit about the rest.
t1_duaapuo	0	*	I'm Dutch. We should leave the EU as well.
t1_duai8ws	1	*	And here's the first person who's read the article.  I'd gild you if I could be arsed. Well done for reading it, unlike the vast majority of the people who commented or upvoted. 
t1_duajw2b	0	*	Omg, imagine what it would be like if randoms on reddit thought you voted to leave?  That edit was very sad. 
t1_duaem9g	1	*	Imagine if any of that was in any way applicable to the EU.
t1_dua8q2x	0	*	Which just happen to be British business interests as well or do you think those Japanese companies Import Japanese workers to work at those factories and companies in the UK?
t1_dubdzie	1	*	Well, plus the phrase Japan thinks which makes no sense to begin with. 
t1_duaawiy	1	*	Probably all the people working for Japanese businesses who's jobs are on the line.
t1_duaeiy6	1	*	> for every xa31 the city pays to the EU it receives xa314 back  So it's basically the Mississippi of the UK?
t1_duadmut	1	*	If you read the article it's just one guy in Japan.  This 'news' is getting ridiculous.
t1_duafoik	0	*	People voted leave out of spite. Lol.

t1_duae0xw	1	*	> Ironically lots of people whom I have spoken to from that area state they did it to teach Westminster a lesson, rather than Brussels.  What was the intended lesson? Democracy is flawed?
t1_dua9ib1	0	*	You mean like how Russia influenced the vote itself with propaganda?
t1_duarmme	1	*	In their defense, they didn't cause all those wars in the Middle East or topple any regimes. 
t1_duabbyx	1	*	Doesnt that mean someone else in the EU was being shafted? 
t1_dua8pjd	0	*	Brexit itself isn't awful, the way the government is handling it is. I wanted to Remain in the European Union, but I respect the outcome. The government is handling this awfully though.

t1_duyqsmn	1	*	Amazing. (Almost) every word of what you just said, is wrong.
t1_duzh6i0	1	*	But to produce plastic you need the raw resources (oil) and then you need to manufacture and ship it. 
t1_duz9t8q	1	*	No. Plastic is the problem. 
t1_duzf8z4	1	*	There are already a lot of stores like this. Even kroger has  bulk section where you can bring a muslin bag or a jar to buy dry goods instead of using plastic.
t1_duyw4j3	1	*	Jars have existed a long time. They work great for this stuff.  You can even use plastic jars if you want. The key is to cut down on one-time-use plastics.

t1_duqbj3f	0	*	I'm at the point I would be shocked if President Kanye West did half the shit this guy has done in the past month.
t1_dur6xi5	0	*	It's because they all have more capability and brains than Donald. Which is again massively scary for many reasons. 
t1_duqc8k1	1	*	Would have meant instant impeachment

t1_du5upde	0	*	Hydrogen Electric Fuel Cell cars haven't even begun to be introduced at any scale yet. The future is both batteries AND fuel cells.  Why do people insist it must be either/or?
t1_du5dpeq	0	*	You don't know much about Turkey. It's not Saudi Arabia.  Get off the MSM once in a while
t1_du53moo	1	*	With a huge enough hydrogen tank to go 480 km....

t1_dsuzip6	1	*	Holy fuck what a little bubble we all live in.

t1_dsuv7jt	1	*	> hat $15B or whatever will be a waste of money  $40+
t1_dsv8bs8	1	*	That's some serious political correctness 
t1_dsvptj1	1	*	And make him pay for it?
t1_dsulmm0	0	*	I agree it's better policy for the democrats to compromise but it might not be better politics. That's all that matters these days,unfortunately.
t1_dsuv6bc	0	*	As Colbert noted yesterday, he's ONE POUND away from being classified as obese.  What a strange coincidence, he happened to be just one pound short!
t1_dsvqbbw	0	*	In the end, they'll place one concrete barrier at the border, declare it a wall, and claim they MAGA.
t1_dsufmle	1	*	Thank god for small miracles

t1_dthtf9l	0	*	Thank you :)
t1_dthpoji	0	*	Correct
t1_dti0p8e	1	*	Meh, our Earth's experiencing a severe oxygen reduction. Humans might go extinct a little bit before dying at 113's considered dying young.
t1_dthvy1y	1	*	Sorry
t1_dsrrjsi	1	*	Notice how the Finnish arent involved? Almost like they dont exist:thinking:   Hope this guy hangs 
t1_dtuc5uu	0	*	That was a thing of beauty, also the off-axis faring separation reveal of Starman in his Tesla Roaster with the earth in the background was a nice bit of showmanship.
t1_dtpdinz	0	*	You dropped an L

t1_dsv2a88	1	*	Like hezbollah got a chance..
t1_dtcpnj0	0	*	And neither should they, since they are not bound in any way to respecting sanctions that are decided unilaterally by the US.
t1_dtchd11	0	*	Things were going to well and there were no missile tests lately so they had to spice things up.   
t1_dtcv1pe	1	*	You say this as if Russia and literally everyone must support everything the US does, including *unilateral* sanctions against a country without any UNSC approval
t1_dtcw0zw	1	*	It's completely reasonable to not recognize unilateral sanctions by the US, but you also need to look at it from another angle -- Russia has veto power in the UNSC.
t1_dtcvw6n	1	*	Nothing to see here. Look up the meaning of unilateral action when in doubt.
t1_dtcyfwg	0	*	>Behold, what side of history whom Russia is siding with. Let the historians 100 years from now know that Russia was siding with ~~North Korea~~ the rule of law.
t1_dtcesa2	1	*	Both?
t1_dtch9hn	1	*	Edgy
t1_dtchen8	1	*	I thought they would at least lie about supporting them, but do nothing, as usual.
t1_dtd3gx9	1	*	Question, do you think they are being honest when they say they will abide by un sanctions ?
t1_dte86go	0	*	That is the secondary issue as you recognized.   Personnel are allowed to use cell phones on the civilians networks such as Roshan or MTN. 
t1_dtdyji0	1	*	No. No he did not. There were no christians in caesars day. At least not in Gaius Julius Caesars day. There were Roman Emperors who did. Caesar did not.
t1_dsns7a9	1	*	Meh. NYTimes. What do you expect. They have sung praises of literally every new Saudi king that has come into power. Strongly recommend you look into other reports of this investigative panel report.

t1_dstb28b	0	*	That was in front of the House Intelligence Committee, not Mueller or a grand jury.

t1_dsv0fgi	1	*	Say. How is that fire and fury book? If it okay for a layman to understand or is it written in an abstract way?
t1_dsto2ak	0	*	He totally can. In his circumstances, it's what he should do and what his counsel is probably telling him. If he does anything but this, he's out of his mind.
t1_dst8u3g	1	*	Da.
t1_dstam9n	1	*	They tried to make him go to rehab, but he said nooo nooo no.
t1_dst8n95	1	*	Considering that Cambridge is aligned with the Mercers who kicked him out of his newspaper, I'm not sure how much loyalty remains there ...

t1_dstzwt7	0	*	I heard that 6 months ago.
t1_dst9jov	0	*	That grand jury are sharks that have the table set to eat his ass, bullshit like that would only land him in  max 18 months solitary confinement or remembering  It's a grand jury, you have no rights

t1_dst9xsb	1	*	Its stolen directly from Latin (where a lot of our legal terminology comes from). Sorry :(
t1_dstajgp	0	*	Meh. He's still got sienfeld money. And keep in mind, he's in the group of party before country so we won't know for sure which way he'll go.
t1_dst0k2y	0	*	It's almost as if there are different standards for publishing on Breitbart and answering pointed questions asked by attorneys.... 
t1_ds7iv69	1	*	This is not corruption. This is incompetency. Incompetency at corruption. Seriously? 8$?
t1_dunebhb	1	*	you're horrible...
t1_dspiik7	0	*	Dumb comment. This is kids sharing a video of classmates doing it that went a little viral.  This has nothing to do with people abusing kids in basements or shady distribution channels.

t1_dv2l34h	1	*	Kissinger sort of lowered the bar for that price so much that afterwards everyone else seemed not to crazy.
t1_dv38su8	1	*	If you nuke the world until it is a desert wasteland, then use lasers from space to melt it, and then let it cool...the resulting glass will be very peaceful. 
t1_dv2xgll	1	*	I would, but only if it had small pieces that pose a choking hazard.

t1_dv2xtmc	0	*	They should just burn that one. 
t1_dv2sr03	1	*	If the article is correct, the nobel committee believes the nominations are fraudulent after they reached out to the person who the nominations claimed to be from.
t1_dv34akl	1	*	Russia??
t1_dv2saa9	1	*	Like the two black cats that passed neo.
t1_dv2gzau	1	*	I think we could get a recommendation from Vladimir Putin. That should be enough to make him win, right?
t1_dv3000u	1	*	I can't tell if one of his stooges did it because they really believe this, or if someone just thought it'd be extremely funny.
t1_dv32ozk	0	*	Kissinger?
t1_dv3xnkn	1	*	There are four lights!

t1_dv3wc71	0	*	He somehow managed to increase tariffs after his embarassing visit to India
t1_dv3yecb	0	*	Steel is not covered under NAFTA and the law being enacted actually predates NAFTA.  There is no way to really fight this using it.
t1_dv410ci	1	*	There is much truth in this. People like Trump have always been around, what differs now is that people are both stupid and bigoted enough to support someone like him.
t1_dv4gupa	1	*	They do it indirectly. Think interest, inflation, and using your countries laws against you. It's mutually exclusive gatekeeping.
t1_dsscctf	0	*	I'm not sure if there's an English version anywhere (but I should have noted it's French in the title).
t1_dtkr7nn	0	*	Yeah, Aussie equivalent to Billy no mates.
t1_duwz97z	1	*	For real. I wouldnt stand for this shit in my country, but China isnt my country!
t1_dt3dy9v	0	*	Is this a joke I don't get?
t1_dtj2xoh	1	*	It is funny how Republicans always preach free markets and doing away with government oversight but when in power they do everything they can to control the markets to favor their corporate sponsors. 
t1_dtigb44	1	*	Don't you just love it when this sub upvotes the most ignorant statement to top comments without any thought or analysis just because it's anti-Trump?  
t1_dtj4fiw	1	*	They should pay your congress men more...
t1_dtjbrta	0	*	Exactly.  america doesn't pay.  they are so far in debt it is rediculous.  Greatest country on earth my ass. 
t1_dtidjzd	0	*	Because it has bankrupted all solar manufacturing in the U.S. Even a government funded one called Solera.  Obama tried to pass similar tarrifs to protect Solera.
t1_dtjye2y	1	*	So Trump is actually achieving world peace?  Okay, that guy is crazy, better to work it out ourselves before getting him involved.
t1_dtjb4rk	0	*	I thought Hanhwa was a Korean conglomerate. I don't recall any German Hanhwa manufacturers.
t1_dti1pz4	0	*	Also what happens when you already have contracts to supply things and then tariffs wreck you?
t1_dtif9sm	1	*	Read Adam Smith!
t1_dtj00g0	1	*	Taiwan would lose without a doubt. China literally has cannons trained on it 24/7 that would obliterate it within a half hour. the US could try to help but the outcome is inevitable. 
t1_dtj4m7q	1	*	I like how the 2 companies lobbied for the tariff was German and Chinese, while South Korea and Malaysia took the largest hit on this...  Yet the media going muh trade war on China
t1_dtjisgt	0	*	I've never had a problem with Canadian Solar, so that's irritating.
t1_dshp3ac	1	*	They probably have all sorts of plans already in place for many what ifs   He probably just means they wouldnt do it unless they needed to.

t1_dusmp2f	0	*	The right wing is less a spectrum nowadays and more an elevator shaft to fascism, racism, sexism (the actual words, not the memes)
t1_durwy2v	0	*	You might want to read the article before you comment.
t1_ds2g7jq	1	*	Don't mind the crickets.     They're kept as pets in Japan.
t1_dsxqtnb	1	*	Anything critical of the democrats is Russian propaganda says a leftist think tank.
t1_dsz6ake	0	*	Russia wont let that happen. Syria is a Russian protectorate, Israel and the Gulf states US protectorates. 
t1_dsy9xve	1	*	Russia withdrew there troops from the area so that could mean anything. 
t1_dsxzmz5	1	*	Hiya there Erdogan. How you doing?
t1_dsycr37	1	*	No turkey along with others were aligned with the rebels
t1_dsyfwi8	1	*	No lol. Israel does surprise attacks not constant air support. The Turks will have to run regular sorties over a relatively small territory. SAA can make life tough for them.
t1_dsxo0p6	1	*	[2012 Turkish F-4 Phantom shootdown ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Turkish_F-4_Phantom_shootdown)

t1_dsq1f1x	0	*	Butterfly eating humans
t1_dsqggbx	1	*	Came here to say this.  Nifty as it is to know something can eat our waste, this current one is not a great solution. Less plastic good, no food bad.

t1_duzxda6	0	*	You can buy firearms from another citizen without a 3rd party 
t1_duzz66m	1	*	I'm guessing it's targeted to prevent school shootings. Many of the children killed in schools in the last 20 years have been killed by people under 21.
t1_duzzqhe	0	*	The Parkland Florida shooting was perpetrated by a 19 year old that bought the guns legally.

t1_ds4bvlh	0	*	It was a joke that no-one was meant to hear and take seriously. Also it wasn't leaked live. Anyway he outlawed Russia and not the USSR, so you got it wrong.
t1_dt205a6	1	*	My first thought was 'I didn't know Muslims were a thing in Thailand'. Lo and behold, your comment explains it.

t1_dtxifzz	0	*	Erlander ruled Sweden for 23 years
t1_dun7mav	1	*	Your comment lost a lost of steam there at the end. I'm not sure if you were talking about Russia or the US and then brought up some space race that happened 50 years ago. 
t1_dt0hya9	1	*	Oh the poor hindooooos. Fuck off please. 
t1_du6vk80	0	*	'member when the US government tried to paint MLK as a Soviet stooge?  I 'member.

t1_dt0ahjs	0	*	[Citation politely requested]

t1_dsysxla	1	*	A Gnome is a Troll spelled differently.
t1_dsyf6x0	1	*	No, he *is* terrible, what you're seeing is people noticing that.
t1_dsywe9q	1	*	Bots or not, it's quite a difference if Trump interacted with accounts from eg. UK, an ally of USA or accounts from Russia. IMO it makes it a bit more acceptable.
t1_dsyso4r	1	*	What? No it doesn't. You just completely made that shit up.
t1_dsz29wa	1	*	Have you considered that your average person has what would be considered a generic picture and name? That's why we call them generic.
t1_dsyvdzx	0	*	Twitter audit site also says Trump has 13 million.
t1_dsyvsg3	0	*	Sounds like you should be pushing the president to get off Twitter then if that is the case. You don't want the president promoting software that promotes violence towards anyone. O wait...
t1_dsyouc0	0	*	Lets get you there. Whats your position?
t1_dszrm00	0	*	> I don't like Trump, but  You have to know that this is basically a meme now. Do you?  When I see that, I just assume you are a Russian propagandist.
t1_dt1wiyl	1	*	Hopefully I am not in the 1%. LOL

t1_dv3pae0	1	*	What a shit, badly thought out and inaccurate comment. 
t1_dsq4o5e	0	*	Dude let them enjoy their monopoly money.  If it is not doing any harm to you then don't worry about it. 
t1_dsq663z	1	*	Blockchain has a real future as a technology.  Bitcoin and all these other cryptocurrencies... more doubtful (other than your list).
t1_dt6mvu7	1	*	Lol
t1_dt6xdr7	1	*	This but non ironically 
t1_dt7094w	0	*	Yeah, this should really be flagged as misleading
t1_dt6redv	0	*	lol sure because its the blue states that are all in debt...
t1_dt6y9ir	1	*	Yeah, that and Canada has ten percent of the population as the US so it doesnt really mean shit.
t1_dt6t6xm	1	*	You need to use two line breaks to drop down a line.  Example:   1 [ENTER][ENTER] 2 becomes:  1  2
t1_dt6xitx	1	*	> It was a giant boondoggle and a global embarrassment from a madman  It was?
t1_dt6z628	0	*	I pay a LOT of tax, but Im happy to. It just means Ive been successful with running my companies and my life. 
t1_dt6xuxy	1	*	Everyone diddles their clit togetherrrr!
t1_dt76l58	1	*	This is what people refer to as fake news. Add the provincial corporate tax to the federal and its always higher than the American.
t1_dt6tve0	1	*	Im American and support lower corporate taxes, as long as the loopholes are closed too. They barely pay taxes and some companies cost the taxpayers money
t1_dt6xj3x	1	*	I don't know... that sounds like the spitting image of progressivism.
t1_dt6ypbi	0	*	I don't think Conservatives are in any position to talk about debt.  It was just two Conservative political terms that gave Canada about 90% of its debt. 
t1_dt6miv0	1	*	No they haven't.  They've only passed two budgets, they've yet to do anything but adjust short term government spending. 
t1_dt6z348	0	*	Your arguments arent very good. Perhaps you need to read and reflect more.
t1_dt6p1bz	1	*	So true!!!  
t1_dt6zl8a	1	*	Corporate taxes are totally different from income taxes for the rich. 
t1_dt70feh	1	*	Lmao. This is the only answer required in the thread. 
t1_dt7kqca	1	*	shhh let him have his moment.
t1_dt72azf	1	*	Same with Sweden. They pass most taxes onto citizens on average.  Which works okay but the loopholes are amazing.
t1_dt72mbq	1	*	Damn, that's a lot of taxes! 
t1_dt6epnq	1	*	I guess the better idea would be to spend more millions fighting the court decision and failing repeatedly like Harper did? 
t1_dt71593	1	*	First thing I thought of 
t1_dt74p27	0	*	Fraudulent in what way?
t1_dt7b5bp	0	*	That will never happen. The EU will just tell businesses if you want to sell in the market you will remain in the market. The EU is a bigger market than the US.
t1_dt6yqyl	1	*	It's also fun to listen to him explain quantum computing like I hadn't already watched the same YouTube video he obviously did.
t1_dt70g8t	1	*	And his hair.  Cuts like that don't come cheap. 
t1_dt724mb	1	*	They have cut way more than that too, the public transit credit alone could be $1000 in extra taxes for some middle class families.
t1_dt78nj8	1	*	Having a world leader take a stand and actually say these things it definitely not nothing much. 
t1_dt6yzbq	1	*	Sure looks good though.   Smile and wave. Smile and wave.
t1_dt77ms5	1	*	And the minimum wage will go up to 15$/ hour next year

t1_dt76fwf	1	*	Realistically, he doesn't do anything for anyone but himself and his cronies. 
t1_dt6o7ob	1	*	Still, at least he is saying something.  Maybe changing attitudes?   Wish he were my leader...  (T-T)
t1_dt709p5	1	*	The landing cushion is already prepared by the US
t1_dt6zgct	1	*	He's trying to attract people by telling the super rich he wont raise taxes on them, but the plebs will think hes talking about lowering them.
t1_dt6z92l	0	*	There aren't nearly as many tax loopholes in Canada as the states 
t1_dt7d7kd	1	*	Well that make trudeau sound like a self promoting piece of shit
t1_dt784lq	1	*	Because thats not what every politician does. 
t1_dt78u85	1	*	But does Canada have the same loopholes? Very few US companies actually paid the uncompetitive  rate
t1_dub1ljn	1	*	For 5 seconds I had a *very* different image in my head of what must have happened.
t1_duapd2p	1	*	Source? That sounds... fake   Or was this a joke
t1_dub285g	1	*	Except the nations in the region, including many nations with Muslim leaders, are also at war with these groups...
t1_dt6s0z8	0	*	They know lol. Believe me they know. They just don't care haha.

t1_dt7d37p	1	*	2024 is when the international community is ending funding with a possible extension to 2028 but that will be the end of its operational life.
t1_dt7qzyp	1	*	Because the ISS gets decommisioned in 2024 anyway. Might as pretend to be responsible for it. With all his failings thusfar, he needs a win, something he can claim responsibility for.
t1_dt7d00b	1	*	The global concensus is to collectively stop funding it in 2024.
t1_dt86uzv	0	*	Yeah, 90 days was Spirit Rovers timeline. Too bad it lasted almost 3,000 days
t1_dt95r7v	1	*	better to use a Lagrange point (L1) between earth and moon. more stable.
t1_dt7d1za	1	*	The ISS isn't really useful for that purpose. Besides, by 2028 it'll basically become a space hooptie.

t1_dtkn898	1	*	They used mice who are susceptible to developing cancers. But they let the cancers 'spontaneously develop' rather than attaching cancers onto them.

t1_dtk8f6b	1	*	Well, we already know how HIV medications, polio vaccinations, and what not are dealt with. How would this be any different?

t1_dtkb938	0	*	Thanks so much for this I was about to search my NIH and college database about this, but you saved me lot of time. Appreciate it

t1_dtk7gdm	0	*	My fear is that most people don't understand economics, and for some reason we still let them vote. 
t1_dtkf779	1	*	Only the movie. 
t1_dtkhepq	1	*	I'm pretty sure cold medicine makes more money.
t1_dtkg057	1	*	Amazing news. Now I don't have to quit smoking.

t1_dtk74g3	1	*	Chemotherapy is big businesses 
t1_dtkaj19	1	*	Bye!

t1_dtkgizp	1	*	Only if our eyes aren't real. Study it out.
t1_dtkiepa	1	*	One thing you can do is  look through the lists of clinical trials and search for immunotherapy cancer research.   They recruit cancer patients all the time.  Best of luck to your mother in law.

t1_duiwr3k	0	*	That was a sensationalist headline about some jews who called for boycotting early nazi Germany.

t1_dt55fga	0	*	Nope, a deal the US shaped and negotiated, and when perfected was abandoned 
t1_dt6cwdu	1	*	It's a classic US sentiment issue on Reddit. US does something it is bad, Canada does the same thing with actually worse provisions and is seen as better. 
t1_dt4jy9o	1	*	I mean its a nice idea but that clearly isnt whats going to happen 
t1_dt5iq0x	1	*	Yeah, well thank God that most everything tastes like chicken.

t1_dt5dz8s	1	*	Awww boo boo, did someone wake up with out a pacifier this morning???
t1_dt5fkzn	0	*	The golden rule of reddit political theory: if Trump does something, side with the opposition.
t1_dt5cyqi	1	*	I mean, it's the only thing he's done that I'm totally on board with. Almost everything else not so much. I'm also surprised he didn't make a bigger deal out of it.
t1_dt5ay9u	1	*	Im not sure why you would trace us? Maybe trade for our lumber,coal,grains, water, potash, gold, ect ect 
t1_dt56fye	0	*	It sounds like his concerns have been addressed, possibly with Canada's leadership.  It's not a race for the bottom, if everyone is required to meet first world labour standards.
t1_dt5ys0s	1	*	Keep us updated! I would be too. 
t1_dt5ekq6	1	*	Forgot the /s there.
t1_dt58jp1	1	*	Its crazy how opinions have changed on TPP.  I dont think its a crazy thing to say that if Sanders shad won and pulled out like Trump did, there wouldnt be this stark change in opinion.
t1_dt5c25t	1	*	Putin certainly got his return on investment out of this deal.
t1_dt5aiwd	0	*	Lmao, did you say the first sentence when Trump pulled out last year?
t1_dt5h8pg	0	*	Alberta, can you explain a little? 
t1_dt58zs0	1	*	We are American and America first. Thats how you MAGA.

t1_dt5ecn8	0	*	Fuck you. Rest of the world.
t1_dt5h30q	0	*	Sad that seemingly level headed individuals like you need to suffer though. Im concerned the people you mention would cut off their nose to spite their face
t1_dt5x8vl	0	*	This post brought to you by random select autocomplete.

t1_dt4w5zc	0	*	Hey, come on! He's just helping you The_Donald folks make Merica Great Again or is it Shithole Trumpland now?

t1_dt4myc6	1	*	As an American; I think it's good that countries don't deal with the US, even if it affects the economy in the short term.  He's making the country appear selfish.
t1_dt4xoe2	1	*	to a certain extent, it was irrational mob mentality hate in the first place. One thing I never saw was a good fleshed out reason to oppose from a person who wasn't already red int he face about it.
t1_dt58hoc	1	*	> This was the one thing I was glad Trump killed  He didn't kill it, though. He dropped the US out of it, so everyone else involved dropped the provisions the US had included and kept negotiating.
t1_dt58sq0	1	*	In fact, forget the trade agreement.
t1_dt552np	0	*	This was designed to do to white collar middle class jobs what NAFTA did to blue collar middle class jobs in the US.  If you are not a 1%-er in the US, this was a bad deal for you.
t1_dt6eqte	1	*	Because the agreement has changed since the US's withdrawal.  They continued to negotiate after Trump originally pulled out.  
t1_dt519uf	0	*	Nah just a trade agreement with terrorists. Seeing how much he loves them. First millions of dollars, now trade lol jk  but seriously, he's a big pussy. Big, wet, nasty one too. 
t1_dt5a5it	1	*	This can be interpreted two ways.
t1_dt56qus	0	*	Yes.     Trump has really fucked up the economy bad.       Especially for black people. Worst employment rates ever for them.     Oh. Wait.         Well, we can all agree he should tweet less. 
t1_dt5ggdr	0	*	Why is lack of IP protection good for Canada tech sector?
t1_dt59isn	0	*	> My 401k is doing phenomenal  Bullshit.  This is pretty much copy pasta for Trump trolls at this point
t1_dt5fh08	1	*	Thing is... with the U.S. out it can be quite easily brought down, if people oppose it enough.
t1_dt56jh4	1	*	Worst leader USA ever had.  Dumb
t1_dt5lua5	1	*	Wrong trade deal. You're thinking NAFTA. 
t1_dt53gyj	0	*	>  Trump's failure to do anything will block a few bad things along with all the good things.  Actually he did do something. He explicitly pulled us out of TPP negotiations.

t1_ds61yzr	1	*	You do seem like an authority on the matter. 
t1_dtrzu11	1	*	actually thats the main way to getting submarines, most of the main sensor platforms for hunting subs are helicopters and aircraft because they can cover large areas of ocean rapidly.
t1_dtrnkun	1	*	Yep, the descendants of the animals that ate the soft bits.
t1_du2qlg7	1	*	Batman vs Heisenberg
t1_dubxq7u	0	*	What about the thousands of Americans that were killed in Iraq and Afghanistan. It was all meaningless they died to protect the oil trade.

t1_dspn87d	1	*	Bro India has been a nuclear state for decades.
t1_dspy2kr	1	*	Its what the internet is for. Advances in space launch systems and lower cost satellites in greater numbers could make faster satellite internet a reality. For that, of course.

t1_dsejw8f	1	*	Not really surprising though is it. Not a hard thing to account for.

t1_ds2kybz	1	*	Its a piss fight vs Iran with Yemen in the middle
t1_duhb197	1	*	The fact that that's the first place they go raises some questions for me. That's not what we were trying for or anything.

t1_du4mbt8	1	*	That's because it's a story from 2008. It was revealed during the campaign in 2016. I guess the news is recycling the story.  The headline makes it sound like it's a new story. 
t1_du4jyg1	1	*	I'd agree if it wasn't for the plenty of other things that suggest an inappropriate relationship between Trump and Russia. 
t1_du4raht	0	*	It's a bribe. The Russian is buying policy. 
t1_du4itml	1	*	A lot of people are saying and I can tell you I make great deals. The best deals. Because a lot of people are really upset about what's happening in this country. Believe me. Sad.
t1_du4s9vq	1	*	Not like you'd have done anything...

t1_du4jg04	1	*	and what was the Russians reasons for that markup
t1_du4lrbn	0	*	Yes, exactly, that is a way to wash money off or pay bribes to politicians. Very common in 3rd world countries, I guess US is turning into one as well. 
t1_du4ik1v	1	*	Ya got em!  Call Adam Schiff you cracked the case!!
t1_du4ztpk	0	*	There's other things that happened besides the sale. 
t1_du4icje	1	*	Why would they need to ask that? They already know everything about this phony scandal you guys are continually trying to push.
t1_du4icj6	1	*	Because 90% of Reddit doesn't know it's asshole from a hole in the ground about the majority of topics.  Especially economics and finance.
t1_du4iblg	0	*	Can I be an Omega male?
t1_du4kuvd	1	*	Lol, so if this had been Hillary youd be saying the same thing right?
t1_du4ps36	1	*	No it's because this bastard paid for his presidency 
t1_du4oll0	1	*	Because Reddit is still upset Hillary took that L

t1_du4w7qm	1	*	Sidebar rules: No US Politics. Literally has a Trump tag on the post...
t1_du4kgsu	1	*	Democrats criticize Trump for paying the *correct* amount of income tax.  You are surprised by this?  Just grab some popcorn and enjoy the show.

t1_du4gw1d	0	*	I think that was a mic drop I just heard. 
t1_du4n755	1	*	Yuge deals.
t1_du4nyba	1	*	You can bet he does. He wants the records that prove it.

t1_du5dzo3	1	*	Pursuit of Profit doesn't absolve you from committing a crime though.
t1_du5m2qw	1	*	Putin has said himself that Russia has enough arctic territory lol in Alaska we don't have a lot of livable land, with wet lands, tundra, sub 0 conditions etc, it's not for the weak

t1_du4ku7b	1	*	The new things is that now somebody cares
t1_du4hyn7	1	*	This is the carrot to the blackmail stick...  
t1_du5d11u	1	*	Also stupid at NBA deals. Just look at what happened to Brooklyn after Russian ownership.  Boy do Russians know how to overpay!
t1_du4i9po	0	*	Do you know what Occam's Razor is? Because you need to make more assumptions to say it's money laundering than, say, just a market transaction.
t1_du4lcw3	1	*	he's the president. :/  
t1_du4in7a	1	*	Very Stable too.
t1_du4mhyu	0	*	Just an fyi, the average profit on flipping a house is under $60k. So just raise that by two orders of magnitude, should be easy no?
t1_du4vh7p	1	*	Good thing she's our president
t1_du4hvef	1	*	This guy is a seasoned crypto user...
t1_du4iwhf	1	*	If one of them makes enough noise and gets enough attention, half of the others might start wondering too.
t1_du4k6eu	1	*	Real estate prices didn't collaspe until 2009. Trump literally sold at the top. Apparently that's criminal now. 
t1_du4lgq7	1	*	Russian bots keep reposting it
t1_du4qpib	1	*	Yeah, republican welfare queens are sure out in force! [Map!](http://cdoovision.com/us-map-of-welfare-recipients/us-map-of-welfare-recipients-fspchangenyt-e1352407092248/)
t1_du4ntr1	0	*	^ After a year with Trump its _obvious_ that hes a business genius and this deal has NOTHING to do with money laundering. In closing: Trump innocent! 
t1_du4i1zd	1	*	I prefer 'whatabout the emails?!?!?' for a deflection tbh
t1_du4h3g3	0	*	An even simpler explanation would be a regular real estate deal, since, you know, Trump is pretty much in the real estate business...along with fine silk men's neckties and dress shirts.
t1_du4jp5q	0	*	It was mold infested and the guy who bought it tore it down, why you think the house is relevant in this scenario is beyond me.
t1_du4vbs2	1	*	Its called money laundering. 
t1_du4l5xh	1	*	Is alaska a russia collusion? 
t1_du5lvcl	1	*	he's a genius businessguy. Genius!
t1_du57fd0	1	*	Selling real estate at a profit is ok but accepting double its value when property values were falling is suspicious and points to money laundering. 
t1_du4pw7p	1	*	This. If people don't understand profit they deserve their lot in life
t1_du4q418	1	*	It's hilarious what Reddit will believe and upvote, honestly. If it's anti-Trump, straight to the top!
t1_du4efqq	1	*	[150 % margin. Totally normal. Nothing to see here, move along, citizens.](https://media2.giphy.com/media/joV1k1sNOT5xC/giphy.gif)
t1_du4jzej	1	*	this is Reddit, all you need is a trump headline and some fake news to make front page 
t1_du4jfou	1	*	very clean deals, laundered you could say.
t1_du4nj8p	1	*	a) He's president. b) He's doing a really shitty job. c) He's into some shady shit.  
t1_du4lfqb	1	*	Lemme tell you, these deals are beautiful, they're very good deals. These deals will create jobs which is wonderful for the economy and the job sectors. 
t1_du4khr4	0	*	To my knowledge prices did not increase over 100% in four years from 2008. That is an exceptional value rise.
t1_du4rcje	0	*	You cant expect those who never run any kind of business to grasp the concept of making money.  Obama gave Iran a $100B in cash and what did he get in return? Nothing. But hey, I am a racist right?
t1_du5b6n7	1	*	My sarcasm detector is through the roof!

t1_du4myf0	1	*	Dude if I could sell a $40 shirt for $100 I would, god damn that some nice markup
t1_du4kbk0	0	*	Sounds like a good explanation, BOO THIS MAN
t1_du4k2ht	1	*	Also this is from 2008. Trump could literally admit it was money laundering and no one could do anything about it as the statue of limitations has passed. 
t1_du52gow	1	*	Jesus, not everyone is on Reddit everyday. 
t1_du4iarn	1	*	lol no....
t1_du4nh0o	0	*	As if that would even absolve you of any wrong doing.  'He only robbed that bank to make some money.'
t1_du4l8r3	1	*	How does a long history of illegal dealings with Russian criminals have something to do with Russian interference in the elections currently...? Really?
t1_du4oqc8	1	*	Putin does.
t1_du4l0kj	1	*	Do you have something that's not opinion?    Would like to read more
t1_du4jxp4	0	*	Putin, former head of the KGB, has been in Executive power since the year 2000. Manafort's emails suggested he'd been planning with the Putin government since 2005. So, are you ignorant or malicious?
t1_du4lsoy	1	*	I bought a house once and 4 years later I sold it to someone for more money. I should be arrested. 
t1_du4j1df	0	*	> so when the housing bubble burst,   He bought it years before the bubble burst and sold it right after it did. Get your timeline on fleek brah.
t1_du4ji09	1	*	If it weren't for all the other Russian connections I doubt anyone would give this deal a second thought. It's the pattern that makes it a story.
t1_du4iz70	1	*	60mill profit is a good deal.
t1_du4qimn	1	*	They really, really are just very, very good deals. Very good deals. You just wouldn't believe how good the deals are. The very best.
t1_du4ljyl	1	*	If 90% of news is anti trump than maybe look a little deeper into your god emperor
t1_du4lnsb	0	*	Criminal?

t1_du4j91o	0	*	Newsweek is absolute rubbish. Details were omitted deliberately because thats the only way to make this look like a story.
t1_du51gxi	0	*	> then renovations when into it and 4 years later it was flipped for $91M  They tore the place down after buying it.  Any renovations had precisely zero value to the buyers.
t1_du4iple	1	*	Or you know, a well proven and analyzed housing bubble. 
t1_du5gpf2	1	*	I think you misunderstand the question.
t1_du4jhoi	0	*	Because it's a non story. 
t1_dsm96ms	1	*	I'm surprised the media are touching this story after the fact. 
t1_dv2ulpd	1	*	The Celts weren't the original people in Britain either.   They came over from France/Spain.
t1_du88ba3	1	*	I don't think that was ever mandatory.

t1_dsdj4rs	1	*	I think Saudi Arabia has a chance of reforming, especially with the considerably more progressive prince that's taking over the throne next. There's a lot more countries that are significantly worse.
t1_dsdcjhg	1	*	I mean, maybe at some point they'd be considered martyrs?
t1_dsdx26z	0	*	They could also move to a place in the world where it's not illegal. That's another non-retarded option.

t1_du46tip	1	*	No. That's why they have to refer to them as customers. They don't know if a house holds a family of ten or a single person, and businesses have no people living in them at all.
t1_du4gm7y	1	*	The power company has a database of all their customers, they don't have a database of all people who live on Puerto Rico.
t1_du41477	1	*	Part of the issue is that the grid had to be pretty much rebuilt from scratch. PR's grid was in really bad shape

t1_du43os2	1	*	Well that sucks
t1_du4b2co	1	*	Customers meaning houses or businesses.  The power companies don't go door to door asking how many people live at each place.  They deal with power meters. 75% of meters have power restored.

t1_dsbg8tt	1	*	Well, he and his bizarro group keep fucking up massively, so of course it'll be mentioned frequently. It's not this sub's fault that Trump is such a mess.
t1_dsbd23p	1	*	True, but this type of reporting keeps the pressure on other suspects and may make them more likely to try and take a deal.
t1_dsaufqs	1	*	3 more years and he will wrap the investigation up and then we can finally get Trump out of office!!!!

t1_du4acra	1	*	Oh yeah mate this ones just a baby.
t1_du4c14l	0	*	For US audiences you need a US state to compare it with. Usually a fraction of Delaware.
t1_dsftmj4	1	*	Yup, the consequences are vastly greater than that person and his social circle....this messes with a whole lot of other peoples' lives.
t1_dsqw41z	1	*	Surrender, surrender, but dont yourself away
t1_dsrrnnd	1	*	Can you imagine what went through that kid's head the moment he saw his Dad through the smashed windshield?  Brings a tear to my eye.
t1_dtgw122	1	*	They just said they are building solar in the states -_-
t1_dtgurdb	1	*	China has built a lot of factories in the US for the past few years. 
t1_dtku1vb	0	*	Are you also against Holocaust denial laws?   No one is denying there were Poles that did horrible things, this law is about Poles as a nation and/or state, not individuals.
t1_dtjqokv	0	*	Probably due to its role as part of our world's heritage.
t1_dupql9n	1	*	Hey man, there's infinite paths to becoming part of my all inclusive one true religion.
t1_dt91iyz	1	*	Not even lol.  But I guess it's a start for nuclear warfare. Truly , Russia is leading the future.

t1_dtq01kg	0	*	I figured out that having yahoo as a home page was one of the ways my father fell into this trump tardism. It aggregates the fuck out of fake news.

t1_dtqeabr	0	*	Anarchists aren't generally considered far-right. Most are considered far-left.
t1_dsp3teg	1	*	Nope. They were over the moment everyone broke for dinner. The Oslo Accords never happened. Neither Israel nor Palestine kept their agreements.
t1_dsct317	1	*	Those film only wins 4 awards. lol. How there are selecting it!!!
t1_dtekt2t	0	*	>given that acknowledgement of the Nakba ethnic cleansing campaign is illegal in Israel.  Yeah that's incorrect, it's not illegal. 
t1_duaj759	1	*	A, even if it was mental illness, mental illness *is* natural.  B, Try to open your mind a tad. Maybe travel a bit.
t1_dtp0kqu	0	*	And?
t1_dtpiwpw	1	*	It appears that way, but I have a hard time believing, with all their resources, they couldn't produce a more solid rebuttal to the investigation.  This all just seems like a distraction.
t1_dtkbosm	1	*	Yes, though the media has picked it up now. Perhaps there is a point to be made?
t1_dtkbn05	1	*	good point.... but this is just echoing the media reports on the topic !
t1_dsv8l1k	0	*	Whats appalling is to see so many people equivalating EU and Russian medias. 
t1_dsgzvqp	1	*	I saw that video on xhamster.
t1_dt71via	0	*	I agree.  Imagine what millions of starving brainwashed NKs will make of SK in about a week.  SK would be very foolish to entertain this ruse.
t1_dt73htc	1	*	We couldn't do that even if they didn't. 
t1_dt76tt0	0	*	Yeah but it's weird that North Korea wants to get all the inheritance when South Korea isn't even dying.
t1_dt74udm	0	*	I feel like any other president would definitely get full credit. And I'm definitely not a full blown Trump supporter. Just strongly independent and have seen obvious bias from each side.
t1_duv3hjb	1	*	Thats quite serious then - he wasnt getting his cut and the perpetrators werent ever going to give him one
t1_duv2pov	1	*	Well R.I.P
t1_dtdh7ne	1	*	Some of them might have pretended to be a president at some point.  *I'm leaving this open for Trump jokes. Don't let me down, Reddit.*
t1_dthcppc	0	*	It's good for him today. 
t1_dtpavrd	0	*	Great to get citizens behind alternative energy!
t1_dtriz44	1	*	The government is using its ability to borrow money at low interest rates. It will have a negligible impact on taxes (I dont believe there are any significant tax increases this election).

t1_dummidc	0	*	This is Melbourne Australia and has no relationship to the topic at hand
t1_dumrdu0	0	*	Because it's not like any American city has a trash problem. That would mean you'd have to call America a shithole too
t1_dumod7c	1	*	That trash is getting a royal ass whooping!

t1_dtsezjm	1	*	Well he is a very stable genius who, like, knows a lot.     /s
t1_dtzfzui	1	*	It doesn't mean much, really. It's happened before.  But those of us who have a special fondness for that peninsula want very much to see this as a hopeful sign.
t1_dsgm85g	1	*	Just let the doctors do their jobs.
t1_du56khb	0	*	Cool story 
t1_dsgwnbh	0	*	All joking aside. (and tweets aside) I don't disagree with what he's done
t1_dshsu0p	1	*	US removed deniclearization as precondition for talks, so US made the massive concessions that led to talks to begin with.
t1_ds9j8af	0	*	What other country did you have in mind? 
t1_ds95ygu	1	*	Or why doesnt he spend the money on them rather than crappy weapons?
t1_ds9le99	0	*	Even if that money was gonna come back to the USA, I doubt it would go to more social services since the GOP hates the poor and unfortunate. 
t1_du077u8	0	*	Because a Kurdish state would be much better in your opinion?
t1_dtzj2wn	1	*	War AND violence. Did you read the article :P
t1_dtzn4mn	0	*	Turkish government is all about influencing children in their way and censoring all other ways so I dont think nitpicking is necessary here. I get your point though...
t1_du07xb0	1	*	Video games did it. It all makes sense now. /s

t1_dtzbste	1	*	No! You have to blame Bitcoin and Crypto any time possible! Kill what you do not understand!
t1_dtzmc9l	1	*	We already have a law to minimize the risk in this case... It's the one that makes jerry-rigging the electrical wiring illegal...

t1_dspj46z	1	*	Its a bullshit excuse to garner sympathy and more free shit than they received in the States. 
t1_dsav1tb	1	*	His initial suggestion was to add a fee of some kind to electronic transfers from the US to Mexico (think Western Union type businesses). 
t1_dsbsco6	1	*	Who is more foolish? The fool, or the fool who follows him?
t1_dsb6nb1	1	*	Wow.
t1_dsbb2d4	0	*	You realize he can get Mexico to pay for it several ways indirectly right? Its not like Mexico is going to hand trump a couple billion and say this is for the wall.
t1_dsbsmof	0	*	All of which will ultimately dump the costs of any wall onto the backs of American taxpayers and consumers. 
t1_dsb6a06	0	*	Reimburse... how?
t1_dsazl1k	0	*	[Here you go](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2017/02/10/514172676/mexicans-in-the-u-s-are-sending-home-more-money-than-ever).  Educate yourself.
t1_dsb5fn3	1	*	I just... I'm so... what is happening?
t1_dsb4pjr	1	*	From what I've read that's only for some 300 miles of the wall too, not for the entire 2000 miles (which he quoted $10B for previously). Someone correct me if I'm wrong.
t1_dsaye5x	0	*	That's because his supporters are cunts. 
t1_dsazp20	0	*	He told him to please stop saying that he would not pay for the wall since it was hurting his polls. Im pretty sure the transcript got leaked. 
t1_dsba1hi	1	*	Lol k 
t1_dsaz0hc	0	*	make him go away. simple as that. the means you use shall not be of my concern though.
t1_dsap22t	1	*	> Think  There's the problem.
t1_dsb1uza	0	*	A wall isn't a secure border. Ladders and rope are still cheap. 
t1_dsazhev	1	*	What I told you was true... from a certain point of view.
t1_dsb29ny	1	*	Think of the worst thing in the world and I'm sure someone likes it. How the fuck 100+ million Americans did this shit? I'll never know
t1_dsb46h0	1	*	Less than HALF a wall. 
t1_dsbpkq4	1	*	The absence of a wall is our wall. Have you see it? its beautiful. No one would dare violate natures beauty. 
t1_dsayjfr	0	*	Wasn't it going to cost like 90 million dollars according to the democrats?
t1_dsbjrjv	1	*	The party of frat boys who burn other people's money and stiff them the tab.
t1_dsb50rx	1	*	Then why don't all his supporters pay for the wall up front and then have the government pay them back with interest.  It's a no risk investment. 
t1_dsbgtjg	0	*	He asked is not the same as he will get. Congress will never grant this monumental waste of money and his time will run out in fall anyway.
t1_dsb3h5r	0	*	How do you figure that Mexico will eventually be forced to pay the USA back?
t1_dsb7qgi	1	*	For the thousandth time Tariffs get passed on to the American purchaser not the Mexican seller
t1_dsclfhv	1	*	Original source please?    Preferably one in which they clearly request $18,000,000,000 from the US taxpayers to build their 'Secure Fence.
t1_dsb44hg	0	*	Show us where Trump said this. Well wait
t1_dsaq12i	1	*	I think he can easily get away with that, if he just makes up some number stating, Mexico has stopped sending bad ppl and now they don't need to pay for the wall.  
t1_dsb2k55	1	*	LMAO like trump can spell cancer. He has done nothing but ruin our international standing. 
t1_dsayoqu	1	*	You should see what r/t_d thinks lol
t1_dsb5p9n	1	*	Shooting themselves in the foot should be the Republican Party motto. Voting against my best interest? Dont mind if I do!
t1_dsb7c0m	1	*	Surprise, here comes the Pence Administration!    Please, no.
t1_dsb6lux	1	*	Can't say I blame you
t1_dsbaqjt	0	*	I dont think you know what enforce means.
t1_dsbvh8p	1	*	So he has no specific plan?
t1_dsb3uk5	0	*	That's the way a cult works, in extremes. Can you think of any cults where the idealogies were just slightly off the average citizen's or bang in the middle?
t1_dsbvw39	1	*	Well he does have a historic approval rating.
t1_dsb430x	0	*	Keep in mind roughly 70% of all Americans did not vote for this assclown.

t1_dsazmp8	0	*	Never mind the icebergs ahead... Captain Smith knows what he is doing!
t1_dsb5xnu	0	*	Lol, why bother? If they have enough unwavering support to vote this charlatan in they could probably elect Hitler reincarnate.
t1_dsb016a	1	*	18B dollar for a little island and then send home  the americans Haha americans of puerto rico now you dont have home... oh shit
t1_dscgaz3	1	*	Probably the most stable in the world. They will have this done within the first month of bring in power.
t1_dsawkds	1	*	Yea so dont worry about it.  Lets have our tax payers fund it and we can get the money from them later.  Believe me, its coming.
t1_dsc7by7	1	*	there is a key difference between making suggestions than ignoring the truth and running with it.
t1_dsd0l3f	1	*	Then you have nothing? Such a shock!
t1_dsbzksy	1	*	I'm going to make something up later, and you'll write it down for history books, because that's the way this works.  Oh, okay then.
t1_dsb7any	1	*	Only if he docks the pay of all the Mexican workers he certainly hires.
t1_dscn9sn	1	*	So nothing then? Somehow, I didn't think so!
t1_dsb45xm	1	*	The electoral college, the south and the Midwest. 
t1_dsb0lmy	1	*	Because the Republican Party is the party of bigots, racists, homophobes, and cunts.  Of course they would believe all that shit.
t1_dsbechb	1	*	it isn't. recently a news team came to inspect the prototype sections built near the current border fence and they filmed a group of illegal immigrants easily clearing it. 
t1_dsbsyqx	0	*	I want to understand. It sounds like you are saying we pay for it now, and then...we put tarriffs on them, so then they raise the price of goods to cover their increased cost. Is that about right?
t1_dscflxj	1	*	Gee... Nowhere in that did Obama propose walling off the entire southern border for a price tag (Conservative) of 18 billion dollars.    Got anything else?
t1_dsb5we6	1	*	Oh you mena other than the $11B to the economy every year? I love how you guys like to prentend only illegals get drunk and drive. Good fucking grief. 
t1_dsb4497	1	*	Deplorables have low IQs.
t1_dsb9ngo	1	*	Can Canadians and Mexicans all just pitch in to put up a wall around the entire US for 3 more years, or until Trump leaves office?
t1_dsbbtom	1	*	Thats a stretch.   He will build it knowing they wont pay and then find a way to suggest they indirectly paid for it.
t1_dsb7nhe	1	*	Still need funding for infrastructure (and maintenance of the same), production, and scientific R&D.
t1_dsb9rjh	0	*	How's that square with their fantasy of deporting all 11 million illegal immigrants?
t1_dsb1frz	1	*	Very good relationship..  Lets not forget this wonderful piece of diplomacy..  https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/politics/australia-mexico-transcripts/
t1_dsbvxzb	1	*	Is this true? link please.
t1_dsbaray	0	*	Who gave you the right to speak for all of Mexico?  That's like me saying I speak for all of america when I know about half would disagree with me
t1_dsb2s0o	1	*	But a fire won't give it to your friends 
t1_dsb8e87	1	*	This is the exact same thing Robert De Niro's character promises in *Machete*. He promised Mexico will pay for a border wall in fucking 2010.
t1_dsb4aq6	1	*	Yeah, almost
t1_dsb1b3q	0	*	Hahahahahaha! That's incredibly retarded. Thank you for that. 
t1_dsb56ob	1	*	What he means is, opposed to the well-known IOU he's going to give them something of his own invention and genius - the soon-to-be famously coined phrase - YOM - You Owe Me.
t1_dsb1erf	1	*	It would not stop either.
t1_dsbdlzm	1	*	Its because he got crowds of racist idiots cheering for it (by which he means *him*), and as he's wholly ego-driven, it's the one thing he really wants to do.  Also he really is that racist himself.
t1_dsateai	1	*	Yeah trade wars are great! /s  Assuming he funded it this way, Mexico would surely retaliate in an economically unsavory way. That would harm us consumers. 
t1_dsb27tm	1	*	Good thought experiment! The military could use another 18er
t1_dsb1vdx	1	*	I mean the only difficulty is building one that doesnt blow up or crash. If you dont care about that consideration, its pretty easy. You can even use a huge vat of coke and mentos or something
t1_dsc9aa3	1	*	American taxpayers = Mexico = Bad hombres?
t1_dsb727l	0	*	Pinche pelos de elote U0001f602 
t1_dsb6hx7	1	*	OR fuck him *with* the wall!
t1_dsb3w7w	1	*	If it's easy enough, how about we just go ahead and do that and then use the money for something actually worthwhile?
t1_dsb68yj	1	*	Good. Fuck mexico
t1_dsbvnwi	1	*	We need to stop subsidizing israel
t1_dsbww49	1	*	People are stupid, that's why. redditors are an average are a bit smarter than the general population, that's why comments like yours are upvoted ore than they are downvoted.
t1_dujwlgg	1	*	Like with any organized crime case, you dont go after the head first. You go after the lower guys on the pole to tighten the rope. 
t1_dukca61	1	*	If he wasn't president, then yeah. On obstruction of justice alone.  You can't just arrest a sitting president though. Doesn't work that way.
t1_dujbk7w	1	*	If he does not go to jail he will end up painting on his hair and living in Russia like Steven seagal.
t1_duj7e0i	0	*	Now that might actually make America great again.

t1_duxp6he	0	*	Then there should also be laws put out that you cannot be in public places while intoxicated, since it possess threat to others.
t1_dux2mz3	1	*	unlike no2, when there are no crackheads?  What's with this prohibitionist style of thinking? Have people learned nothing?

t1_duxm9q2	1	*	You do realize a lot of us don't want PR? I don't get where this idea that everyone who voted for him wants PR came from because it simply isn't true.
t1_dux4az3	0	*	Maybe, we'll have to wait and see. They have followed through with cannabis legalization and this proposal is tangentially related so there's a chance they could get serious about this.
t1_duak9hb	1	*	I mean... we literally went to an Olympics hosted by him...   Not involved with this argument just teaching history.
t1_duaje4x	1	*	I have seen poverty and I have seen death. I have a clue.  Pence is still an A hole.

t1_dtl4uh5	0	*	 People will be curious about the crime for one thing, but also understanding what happened in this particular situation may help prevent others like it.

t1_dv2jsf3	0	*	Stfu. So many Russians all over the place. Or just fucking idiot Americans. Take your pick. Both are ruining the country. Its just that the idiots dont realize it. 
t1_du51lud	1	*	Not as long as you're cocked and loaded
t1_dundjke	1	*	Love being downvoted for stating facts. Trump has killed more civilians in 8 months than Obama did in 8 years. Fuck Reddit is a Trumpcuck haven
t1_dun9kw2	1	*	Trump deserves to be on this list, but so did all previous US presidents. This is the problem. 
t1_dtc2ztl	1	*	It's like practical geography

t1_dtbw6hd	1	*	Good luck enforcing that with a broken icebreaker. 
t1_dtboc5o	0	*	Canada, USA, Russia, Norway and Denmark (via Greenland) are the countries with legitimate claims in the arctic.  I recommend a geography course. 
t1_dtxm2b7	0	*	The US has as much disparity in economic productivity between states as between a wide range of countries, but we don't see this problem there (or maybe you do). Why do you think that is?
t1_dtxigz5	1	*	There not the same at all. Theyll take away our coffee and make us drink tea. Fug tea
t1_dtxgfsh	0	*	I agree mate. You will be fucking swarmed by brits. They wont be the good ones either, cause the good ones could get there anyway. Theyll be the chavvy cunt kind that swarm spain atm.

t1_dtxcy9t	1	*	Which ones did you have in mind? 
t1_dtxopre	1	*	I don't think it would be safe for Canada if Americans could just walk over our border with guns. The black market would be going wild on our side for cheaper guns.

t1_dtxe8gx	1	*	We know what happened the last time the government tried to handle visitors from certain countries differently.  Every court, it was a different answer. 
t1_dtxk7qc	0	*	You seem level headed. How well do you think the US would fit into this group?
t1_dtxpdit	0	*	Damn my only choices would be hobbits, snakes/spiders or people that arrest you for misgendering someone.

t1_dtykfxr	0	*	I also don't want more brits here in NZ.
t1_dtxe5ho	1	*	Why would that be?
t1_dtxhruw	1	*	I see your username :)
t1_dtyuqbt	1	*	It's 2018 not 1758, it takes less then 2 days to sail freight between Aus and Canada and <200ms to communicate between them as well.
t1_dtxh108	1	*	White colonies assemble. The group proposing this are very strict on this criteria.
t1_dtx586i	1	*	Nope. Lots of non-whites in all those countries.
t1_dtylw2u	0	*	BECAUSE GOD DOESN'T TRUST THE BRITISH IN THE DARK  \- Some Scotsman, probably. 
t1_dtxeblu	1	*	Idk why but this made me tear up. So nice to think of the similarities between four beautiful countries. 
t1_dtxmaeh	1	*	Commonwealth has 2.3 billion people.
t1_dtxbzuy	1	*	Liz isn't your head of state.
t1_dtxcvj5	1	*	>we all have Queen Elizabeth and her corgis to bind us.   Ireland: Eh not again cheers 
t1_dtxff2a	1	*	You fantasize about our -40 winters buried in 20 feet of snow and ice?  I fantasize about your rain and overcast skies. 
t1_dtxgx89	0	*	Seems like a good trade off to me.  Leave the European Union, and reform the British Empire.  What could go wrong?
t1_dtxafjl	0	*	You as a Murican technically do not need a passport to even get into Canada. Birth certificate is still legal. You just need it to get back into the USA.
t1_dtxbwmw	0	*	A Brit wants to leave its country for greener pastures on the other side of the water....  Canexit! We dont want them English immigrants stealing our jobs!
t1_dtxe1qr	1	*	Come on over, we can watch Leafs games together.

t1_dtxcnp7	1	*	All of these countries have mass immigration programs.
t1_dtymr98	0	*	> They wont allow ppl with misdemeanor convictions through their airport.  That is because it isn't a misdemeanor here. Your laws and values are not in force in Canada. 
t1_dtxq2hz	0	*	Would you mind if Ireland joined? We have very similar culture and you've all got alot of our immigrants anyway..
t1_dtxc0ck	0	*	We could collectively call them the Four Eyes. Could have been Five but we built a big, beautiful wall in 'Murica.
t1_dtxcxwp	0	*	True, but Canada is not much better. Try looking up the demographics and in all the Canadian cities.
t1_dtxhq47	1	*	Things get better buddy

t1_dtyid5y	0	*	> why not add America  Because they asked, via a war, not to be part of the gang?
t1_dtxb329	0	*	No they dont have this. In any case, french Quebecers don't necessarily identify with France. They are distinct but share a language. 
t1_dtxg65q	1	*	It says in the article why we don't have this. 
t1_dtxehqv	0	*	All have similar cultures and social norms meaning easy to integrate.
t1_dtxkr2i	1	*	da butt hurt is real
t1_dtxh7bp	1	*	Ah yes, those Polish immigrants, notorious for their acts of terror. 
t1_dtxf0sd	0	*	good time to kick out Quebec
t1_dtxafyd	1	*	What do they have to do with anything?
t1_dtx6zzx	0	*	Australia, New Zealand and Canada were British Colonies and large percentages of the populations of these countries can trace their ancestry back to the UK anyway.
t1_dtxdexv	1	*	Canadian too. Maybe I can find me an Aussie girlfriend now!
t1_dtxbrp9	1	*	As an EU expat in the UK, they had a good place to model after
t1_dtxdg68	0	*	It would stay expensive, because the distances are so big. (except AU-NZ)
t1_dtxn7nx	0	*	Opening the gates for 24 million people is apparently fine though?
t1_dtyj7ks	1	*	First time no w be r heard of Canadians being shit cunta
t1_duc7z86	1	*	Nah, exclude the poms...
t1_dtx6tvg	0	*	Then immediately switch to Australia when you realize you're going to be earning a shit wage and spending all of it on rent in those two countries.
t1_dtykhgl	1	*	> don't want to be ticking them off and get threaten with a wall  Apparently they can get Mexico to pay for any walls they need? :P
t1_du1c3x8	1	*	I agree... perhaps we should exclude the UK from this agreement.
t1_dtxc8mi	1	*	The US isn't part of the Commonwealth
t1_dtyifrf	1	*	> What about America =(  You have to have a reverse war with Britain, then wait 242 years. 
t1_dtx7vky	1	*	They should look at ancestry. Take back the people that think their ancestors made a mistake crossing over.
t1_dtxgmwa	1	*	Might as well cave in, youve already lost sovereignty of Whistler to Aus anyway. 
t1_dtyi9ri	1	*	> Getting the colonies back together and nobody invited the US. Awkward.  The guy who bloodied everyone else's nose so he'd be left in peace doesn't get an invite? And **now** he feels awkward?
t1_dty7l0j	1	*	That is the point , removing the visa requirement between the 3 countries ( similar to what Australia and NZ have at the moment ) 
t1_dty1hj4	1	*	Agreed.
t1_dtxoxns	1	*	I moved to Ontario in 2012, beat decision my family has made. Havent regretted it since.   
t1_dtxry3c	1	*	There was a petition going around on change.org in support of it. I remember signing it. 
t1_dtxtn17	0	*	It wouldn't be such a scary thought if the UK's population didn't dwarf the others. 
t1_dtygqgx	1	*	why would they want to downgrade?
t1_dtxcnte	1	*	Thought the exact same except im Irish
t1_dtxk7nq	1	*	Group says so, so I guess so?
t1_dtxg79l	0	*	Do you not find the idea of the Commonwealth a bit cringy though? A talking club that's vaguely the former members of the empire - weird.
t1_dtxsck2	0	*	Canadian here, serious question. Why would you want to move to Canada?
t1_dtigdff	1	*	yeah seems less of a corruption crackdown and more of a corruption consolidation. 
t1_dths59e	0	*	Pretty cut and dry, Honestly
t1_dunrh4c	0	*	Naw just ban the military grade ones so crazies can stop killing children by the dozens. 
t1_ds4vhdx	0	*	More specific, Abrahamic religion is a cancer on humanity.  
t1_dtczr1n	1	*	I don't really think that's the reason, most likely it's just a loss leader.
t1_dtd0zoa	1	*	someone photoshop the helpful universally understood infographic guy from the instruction manuals to be looking sad and holding a flower instead i'm too lazy
t1_dtd05xs	1	*	https://imgur.com/m3rUHJb
t1_duhfd1a	1	*	thought process? what?  No, definitely not in this specimen.
t1_dswl1cc	1	*	Both sides are pretty female dominated, its an issue that overwhelmingly affects women more than men.
t1_dswkzxi	1	*	I would argue that political activism to get people to go out and actually vote (for whatever they want, just go and vote dammit) should be subsidized.
t1_dsx36vj	0	*	No, why would they?
t1_dswmllu	0	*	So you don't believe that aborting a fetus is murder? If you were the fetus and could communicate would you not argue in favor for your potential at life?
t1_dswt1ee	1	*	Agreed; good on him and good on Canada.
t1_dswwu9r	0	*	Why? Theyre not providing any services, theyre only providing an opinion. What do they need funding for?
t1_dswsgs6	1	*	In Canada the government funds catholic schools if they follow normal criteria. 
t1_dsxgvqi	1	*	What do you mean by organizations that dont respect Canada?  You can respect your country but still believe that abortion should be prevented or heavily regulated.
t1_dsx2mv3	0	*	Yeah well..one group is trying to stop baby murder. The other is encouraging it. I see why one is a bit more up in arms
t1_dswmu55	0	*	How unbelievably stupid and ignorant does a person have to be to write something like this?
t1_dsx5am1	1	*	There goes Fox, tripping over their own propaganda. 
t1_dswz5y9	1	*	Bigot
t1_dsw95sk	1	*	Or setting the dogs on socially progressive organizations, pulling funding from groups the supporting reproductive rights...oh wait, Harper did do all those things...

t1_dsx0iy0	1	*	Adulthood at thirty generation.
t1_dswq93r	1	*	Bend over or we'll give you more buzzword names 
t1_dsx058c	0	*	You mean like how republicans constantly block funding for planned parenthood and shut down abortion clinics in their states?
t1_dswnoc7	1	*	Most Prime Ministers get a second term.   And given the field of the other candidates, I wouldn't hold your breath.
t1_dsx5t82	1	*	Sometimes feels that way hey. Mention anything, bam Islamophobia racist. Kinda shuts down a conversation 
t1_dsx0smk	0	*	No.
t1_dsxc379	0	*	It's ok as long as everyone thinks the same way I do.
t1_dswwh7c	1	*	It's funny how that goes nowadays. Till 29 you're young but as soon as you turn 30 it's >30 parties and only cougars from that day on...
t1_dsx1uwm	1	*	This is beautiful. Canada is a country progressing into the future.  
t1_dsx05x9	1	*	Well... I mean, lets be realistic. Im a 30 year old child and I would bet many of us are. 
t1_dsx8hnp	1	*	> punish people who hold unpopular opinions.   American? What a childish talking point. They can their opinion all they want just without the tax funding. 
t1_dsx2b99	0	*	God you people are so dramatic. This really scares you? Get a grip. 
t1_dswqakq	0	*	Is he? If he is, that is just sad. 
t1_dswtrvj	0	*	being against anti abortion isnt the same as being against being pro-life. 
t1_dswm4gf	1	*	No. Theyre not being punished for not having the same belief as the sitting government .... they are not receiving public tax dollars for violating the charter of rights and freedoms. 
t1_dswkzzy	1	*	Yeah he was personally going up there to fix them but decided to make a statement instead. 
t1_dswr7s6	1	*	The world never learns

t1_dswna3v	1	*	It's not.
t1_dsx0u94	0	*	It is not wrong to kill unborn babies because those are not babies.
t1_dswzsi0	1	*	But its not her fucking body. 
t1_dswyrke	1	*	Thank you: THIS x 1M.  
t1_dswm4be	0	*	So are the churches. They have no right to cram their bullshit down anyones throat. If they want to do this shit then move to Iran where it is the norm. 
t1_dswm8zj	1	*	we have elections to take care of that. if the prevailing mood goes counter against the current governments mandate (like what happened with the conservatives), we vote them out. 
t1_dswqmji	1	*	Good thing we're Canadian haha
t1_dsx547o	1	*	Except for individual human rights for unborn children.
t1_dswsx4c	0	*	Why do macabre conservatives want to defund Planned Parenthood?
t1_dswuvzu	0	*	At what point in existence does something have the right to inhabit, feed off of, and severely injure someone else's body?  I submit that the correct answer is never.
t1_dswpz0a	0	*	How is it killing them? They never had a life to begin with. Literally just a chemical/bilogical reaction when sperm meets egg. 
t1_dsx3tcp	0	*	Strange question. This is an abortion issue. If they are anti abortion it would. 
t1_dsxbxil	0	*	Are you complaining about people not from Canada commenting on a post about Canada in a subreddit called World News? That's the entire purpose of this subreddit. It's not your local news forum. 
t1_dswm7qv	0	*	I'm sorry but why the fuck would those groups get this funding in the first place?
t1_dswlg6m	0	*	All beliefs are equal.  But some beliefs are more equal than others.
t1_dswoavc	0	*	What is the relevance of this to the article?
t1_dswodb3	1	*	This government program is not an entitlement, it's to benefit the public.  It's not a punishment to deny someone access to it for whatever reason.
t1_dswublc	0	*	I don't think you know the basis of the argument then.
t1_dswydyr	1	*	Anti abortion argues that they are pro life, just not giving kids a good life
t1_dswxzi4	1	*	OK by me!  (I'm gaining on 50 and still a kid basically.)
t1_dsws8ys	0	*	What if I told you, Canada is in North America
t1_dswsz29	1	*	The womans right to chose is more important than supporting bigoted hateful views of anti-abortion groups.
t1_dswlxch	1	*	I would like to see Trudeau debate Ben Shapiro on abortion but i'm afraid he'd do a gary johnson and sort of start sweating and jazz hands shuffle out of the room 20 minutes into the thing
t1_dswnyt8	1	*	Dammit im 1 year older then a youth. 
t1_dsws1a9	1	*	yeah go please
t1_dswmkpj	0	*	Our social welfare isn't that great on it's own. Granted you do get paid maternity leave but it's not much, it's usually not enough to cover the cost of living in any bigger city. 
t1_dswq290	1	*	You're about 50 years too late for this argument in Canada 
t1_dswze92	1	*	!redditsilver
t1_dswtdmt	1	*	Yeah Canada's culture and government is just sooo foreign to American culture and government
t1_dsx79py	1	*	Good to know that not allowing women to do anything they want for whatever the reason is Misogyny now.  
t1_dswp895	1	*	Canada's weird like that. They hit puberty when they're babies too
t1_dswvz34	1	*	Isn't Trudeau considered a youth then too? 
t1_dswvj4v	1	*	I think you might be...you may want to hide before someone finds a fucking torch.
t1_dswmbhk	1	*	> Hes consistent, i can give him that  I don't agree. If he was consistent, he'd quit defending the hijab
t1_dsxkuni	1	*	> Fox and Friends  Enough said
t1_dswoiv7	1	*	Does that include things like rebates for having energy efficient buildings and carbon monoxide detectors?
t1_dswzwnc	1	*	You make it sound like supporting pro-choice is bad.      It's a matter of choice and he stops supporting those who try to take away the choice - he supports freedom.
t1_dswkp95	1	*	Umm no allowing this group government funding would be double speak which is why we are no longer doing it. 
t1_dswm7k3	0	*	It's absolutely something the government should be regulating.  If your group holds anti-Canadian beliefs then your group doesn't deserve funding.
t1_dswmmow	0	*	Well shit, by that logic, Trump has been blowing a dog whistle to his dipshit base pretty much all day, every day for a couple of years now.  
t1_dswk7lm	0	*	Next the right wing government gets in and uses this as a precedent to ban their opposition groups

t1_dswntth	1	*	Well said.
t1_dswpuo2	0	*	its eh. you just sound like a pirate to us now
t1_dsx7uvj	1	*	> So why shouldn't they have access to the same government programs that pro-choice groups have?  No. You don't fund people who want to knock your figurative house down. 
t1_dswoe46	1	*	who cares, it sends a necessary message to anachronists that fight abortion rights.  Their beliefs are wrong, ascientific and will not be a part of the future.
t1_dswxzim	1	*	Yeah he seems like such a cunt doesnt he?! /s
t1_dswogsq	1	*	and the crazies down south (the US)
t1_dswwvag	1	*	In Canada, if you oppose progressive views then you are silenced by any means.    Its going to become worse and worse. 
t1_dswpxq0	1	*	When that *is* their job.
t1_dswo9tr	0	*	Abortion isn't a religious topic.  
t1_dswokfr	1	*	Cult
t1_dsx08yz	1	*	So weird that you are downvoted for this, guess this threads draw out all the nutjobs
t1_dswof11	1	*	Everybody weighs in on American politics, some even hold it above their own politics. Why cant we on yours?

t1_dsx6i3v	1	*	Same, for 2 days :D
t1_dswltlx	1	*	You know, the early Christian communities were just fine without government funding. It was when they got patronage from the Roman emperor that they start becoming corrupt.
t1_dswozbg	1	*	Canada. So free.
t1_dswth24	0	*	Your bullshit church that hates on women and preaches anti-abortion bigotry has literally killed more children than the holocaust.

t1_dswrsxn	0	*	M8 if you like a president who can make people mad then you have top tier with your current president right now.
t1_dsx01x7	0	*	So you disagree with republicans in america blocking funding for planned parenthood and shutting down abortion clinics in their states?
t1_dswp6mh	1	*	i did so we cancel
t1_dswsi0x	1	*	Surely it is motivated by hatred of women.
t1_dsxwd0l	0	*	Name one. Name an organization that has been defunded because they didn't agree with the government whole similar organizations received funding.
t1_dsx18zh	0	*	You cant be anti-abortion and pro-human rights, either.
t1_dswrwij	1	*	Wats a yoot??

t1_dsx02gb	1	*	Yes that makes perfect sense.
t1_dv0lso2	1	*	I think you are not recalling correctly, IIRC there is a definite and substantial difference in penis sizes across races. The same goes for all human characteristics afaik.
t1_dv0n495	1	*	Inuits: It's just really cold out, okay??
t1_dv2i0cu	1	*	You've eclipsed us all with that comment.

t1_dtcn53v	1	*	> edit: I don't mind the downvotes, but please tell me why I am wrong.  Your post is a perfect example of [whataboutism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whataboutism).

t1_ds16uvw	0	*	You spend too much time on R/Conspiracy.
t1_ds182wg	1	*	If a law creates an unintended effect, it is not a good one.
t1_ds1d0qb	1	*	Swedish, I find these laws extremely concerning. 
t1_ds1o02y	1	*	That has already been defined for decades. Nothing changes in this regard. This is just about holding content platforms accountable for preventing access to illegal content when informed about it.
t1_ds1uu0p	1	*	Your comment fails the in a manner capable of disturbing the public peace requirement, so reddit wouldn't need to do anything.
t1_ds1cyqa	1	*	These laws have literally been in effect, and enforced, since the 1940s.

t1_ds6jmu4	1	*	Well you could have a binding referendum this time instead of a non-binding one.  Or at least keep doing it until you get a margin of victory that isn't too small to be meaningful like the last one.
t1_ds77jc1	1	*	A referendum of such a huge political and economic magnitude should **never** be decided by a 4% margin. Most countries require 60+% majority on most referenda to pass. 
t1_ds72u10	1	*	And he should be grateful to be able to stay there and not rot away in a prison where he belongs.

t1_du51mrv	0	*	But this is every year.
t1_du4yinn	0	*	It's a meaningless statistic. Just like any stat that makes a headline. It's not about the information, it's about everyone spinning it to push their own agenda while the media gets their clicks.

t1_duv00wr	0	*	Or, you take away my meat and dairy and I'll be even *more* depressed.
t1_duuvxq4	0	*	What a shocking revelation. People eating healthier and more balanced diets are surprisingly healthier.   Researchers also determined that people that exercise regularly are in better shape.   
t1_dt8fmuz	1	*	Okay movie, amazing book.
t1_ds13jhk	1	*	Lol, we took in less than 50k. Germany took in over a million.. we are far behind mate. 
t1_ds14jkw	1	*	Because he can't he is basically just a puppet for twitter stunts. 
t1_du1usuz	1	*	Most companies dont even do full references anymore. I work in recruitment, almost every reference is just confirmation of employment dates 
t1_dsyirgg	1	*	Loosen your tinfoil hat. It's cutting off the circulation to your brain.

t1_dv0ai64	1	*	Diesel cars produce much larger amounts of NOx as compared to gasoline engines.
t1_dv0b1e8	1	*	yes, but more NOx from the tailpipe (and particles, but that depends on the the emission control systems fitted)
t1_duz5dth	1	*	In Europe diesel cars have amounted to ca. 50% of all cars sold for the last 10+ years.
t1_duz3yku	0	*	You realize that in Europe you can't even buy a petrol version of many cars? Diesel is the only engine choice for a lot of SUVs, sedans and wagons.
t1_dv0cr9z	1	*	It's not about efficiency, it's about clean air
t1_duzmhm3	1	*	Diesel - 30% less CO2, more of some other pollutants like NOx.
t1_duykogp	0	*	Electric cars do not produce a lot of particulate matter (regarding the tires, yes they do) at the location where they are used. It's the exhausts that harm buildings and people's health. 
t1_duyuufp	0	*	Which is curious since Rome never had much in the way of factories.
t1_dsiifhb	0	*	Since WWII it hasnt worked.  Certainly not in the Middle East.  Incompatible cultures.
t1_dsivrq6	0	*	 You should get specific, what did you see? People are upvoting pure (unsourced and incredibly vague) sentiment because it sounds like something they agree with. 
t1_due5f9j	1	*	I'm sure that even if there wasn't, they'll be able to create one quickly. Although I think NK is pretty open about WMDs etc. 
t1_duee4m6	1	*	Well if they acting all cool and shit then some more obvious testing happens then yeah you're right. I would like to think they had a reality check going out in the world and we respected them.
t1_duen0x6	1	*	Korea will never re-unify.  Rocket Man would destroy the south just like he's destroyed the North.  When South talks about reunification, it's under their flag, not his.
t1_dughzds	1	*	> Peaceful reunification  is impossible.

t1_duhihl6	0	*	>Bc this type of deal is against net neutrality.  No, it's because they don't have the money.  It *is* anti-NN, but that's not the reason it went down.
t1_duh6ltz	0	*	This is called zero rating and Reddit is lobbying against it.
t1_dugv4pr	1	*	It's not perfect, so it might as well die.
t1_dv3zjg8	1	*	Maybe pushing and shoving, or does that not count as attack? What would getting spit on count as?
t1_ds6y6e8	1	*	na, he didn't have a clue.  The US needs the supply routes from pakistan to continue operations in afghanistan, which trump recently decided to send more troops to.
t1_ds6mzdv	0	*	Theres no need to go looking for something to smear Drump with. Falls in your lap on a daily basis. 
t1_ds5x4bg	1	*	No, no, it's not winning... not winning at all...
t1_ds6vetm	1	*	Lol, USA deserves it. 
t1_ds6bqmt	1	*	Well played mate, I'd buy you gold but I'm not spending money on digital cosmetics 
t1_ds7y0ec	1	*	Bring it, bitch. We're not Syria or Iraq.
t1_ds6cxgp	1	*	Pakistan has nukes.
t1_ds7el20	0	*	My first thought when reading the headline was there is now way occurred overnight. Just a convenient excuse. 
t1_ds7ax9f	1	*	China gave Pakistan their Nukes. US turned a blind eye on it. 
t1_ds68zpf	1	*	Also: Iran, Afghanistan, Cuba, Venezuela, etc.  Oh wait... I forgot, Americans choose to believe they all failed because of Socialism and Islam!
t1_ds7pkrj	1	*	So this probably is other way round. US denounced Pakistan because it's trying to harm the Dollar.   Far worse has happened to countries who have tried that. The game has just started here. 
t1_ds7dux2	1	*	Yes. It's a part of the One Belt One Road initiative.
t1_dv1m0w4	0	*	Acid attacks have been popular since long before any guns were banned in the UK. They date back to the Victorian era.
t1_duzwgcn	0	*	Same, especially after seeing that article at the top of /r/science earlier today.
t1_dv0njzm	0	*	You could kill someone with lsd. It's possible. Expensive, difficult and obvious, but possible.
t1_dv0iy4q	1	*	knives were banned and its easier to hide acid in plain sight, its also horrifically painful for the victim so gangs seem to have it up as a tool.
t1_duzxx97	1	*	No. 
t1_dv1ldxy	1	*	I think may rather be stabbed 
t1_ds4nk32	1	*	the evangelicals want it as it's part of preconditions for the apocalypse and tribulations and shit

t1_ds4i68g	1	*	>apartheid laws  Your ignorance is astounding.
t1_ds3x3du	1	*	he called the two parties israel (like a country)  and palestinians (clearly another term than he used for israel)... i think that says enough
t1_ds95p2h	0	*	Trump ran as a no war president? What about his nothing is off the table comments? He ran as a I'm sharing zero information except vague conflicting promises president.
t1_duypy8v	0	*	Do you think that international reaction and subsequent attitude to Trump's election is similar to Obama's election?
t1_dt3ey8e	0	*	Why would Muslims need protection in Egypt?
t1_dt3fo4e	1	*	The Egyptian government cooperates with the pro LGBT Israeli government so it's a wash. 
t1_durap8z	0	*	Because Genghis Khan was a more complex figure than that.   https://youtu.be/Eq-Wk3YqeH4
t1_dsh5ie4	0	*	My former brother in law is also from there. He didn't help mine, but I admit that one or two rotten apples do not spoil the bunch.
t1_dtems91	1	*	Oh, yeah... the revolving door of public service to the rescue again.  Would someone explain to me *again* how this shit is legal?  
t1_du238ol	0	*	Wanna guess which country has a china  containment  policy, pivot to asia, sending warships to chinas front yard, trying to destablize the area using lap dpgs...etc.
t1_du1o1z5	1	*	Its pretty routine to put some sort of defenses on your borders, especially when they are islands which are hard to reinforce. Look at Guam for example.  Probably not aimed at any one party.
t1_ds7km5n	1	*	>  ~~just as North Korea seems to want to de-escalate~~  just as North Korea runs out of food for the winter. Very convenient indeed.
t1_dtl607y	1	*	But if they have managed to make it work they've just taken another step in erroding US tech superiority.
t1_dtv0sou	0	*	Well the UK is separate anyway.   The EU is not a country, merely an organisation.
t1_dso00bd	1	*	Tunnel.
t1_ds4b4nc	1	*	A market is not free, when a monopoly exists.
t1_du47jrn	0	*	Just curious, but what reason would they have to lie about that?

t1_ds3gzjc	0	*	Careful you don't get too angry, you might end up shaking with righteous indignation so much that your tinfoil hat will fall off
t1_dv0jg4u	0	*	the digital age requires traffic traffic doesnt come without clickbaits and over the top stories 
t1_dt3fth4	1	*	The fish arent the problem. Its the humans.   All drug lords and rapists in my experience. Make the humans pay for it. Theyre bad hombres. 
t1_dv2gsp2	1	*	Most of the time the compensation isn't great. And development shouldn't be at cost of other important things like the environment.
t1_dsragdn	0	*	Idiots, that's who. Not only are you putting yourself at risk but you're financing the regime. But hey, thrills!
t1_dsr9yu3	1	*	Edgy frat boys.

t1_du1u1r4	0	*	How is Turkey in war with Syria?
t1_du27opf	0	*	Too late, China is deploying ~~about 5,000~~ soldiers in Syria.   
t1_du1vumq	1	*	I can't tell if you're sarcastically saying that from an Israeli or Syrian POV.  Unfortunately you probably think it only fits if Israelis say it. 
t1_du1k6mk	0	*	I doubt isis is an ally of Israel 
t1_dser7jd	0	*	Wrong. 'Haha' is also appropriate. Lol, triggered snowflakes' may also pass, but I'm not sure if it's appropriate to use 'their' language.
t1_dsf97gj	0	*	> Technically he has the right to sue if he was fired because of his personal views   Does he? Personal views isn't a protected class. Religion is. Race and gender are. Personal views are not.
t1_dtmmask	0	*	It's a Canned Hunt. Like what Cheney was doing when he shot that guy in the face.
t1_dsjem8t	0	*	What makes you think climate change implies *more* water in a given place, as opposed to *less* water or no local effect?
t1_dtgre0w	1	*	Beaker People go home!
t1_dtgfvej	1	*	You know. On the back of their minds.
t1_dtfyon4	1	*	We had a nice short spell there making fun of you guys for voting to screw yourselves, and then we voted for trump
t1_dtfha9m	1	*	Why don't people like politicians like that? Because often they're corrupt, and lie out both sides of their mouth. Trump checks both those boxes.
t1_dtg399s	0	*	And what about Duke William the bastard invading in 1066? I didn't see the left protesting there. 
t1_dtgxfun	1	*	It would be pretty sad if the biggest protest was about a leader visiting who has very little actual effect on their lives.  Do they really have nothing better to get angry about?
t1_dtg3c15	1	*	Because a lot of Brits actually voted for/support Brexit, whereas barely any actually like Trump. 
t1_dtgjuoo	1	*	Hey America, put some of that energy into universal healthcare for your citizens, instead of having shit grammar and illegal wars.
t1_dtghkn0	0	*	They have to start building this up in case it comes by surprise and just a few thousand pink haired morons turn up.

t1_dtfm32c	1	*	No but we don't like racists or rapists either.
t1_dtgec92	1	*	He told Piers Morgan in a recent UK interview that he has been invited by Theresa May to come twice in the next year
t1_dtgztq0	1	*	Those things aren't plastered over social media so people generally don't give a shit. Kinda sad more care about a fat man from another country than they do their own country lol 
t1_dtfot03	1	*	Had a few of those during Camerons time in office.
t1_dtgidnh	1	*	He's already sang that song a few times.

t1_dtgqyel	1	*	> what are they protesting?   Don't think even they know,  > what will this do?  Nothing, 
t1_dtggnnf	1	*	I can call my kids stupid, but if a stranger does, I'll bite their head off!
t1_dtfu845	1	*	The Queen should meet with Sean Spicer and have a banquet in his honour.  
t1_dtgqnjd	1	*	TIL Balmoral is in a relatively remote location, something I never would have guessed on my own.
t1_dthexxz	0	*	He's coming in May...

t1_dtglyde	1	*	They definitely will. The tolerant ones especially.
t1_dtglzsz	1	*	What? That's almost certainly not going to be true. Millions had turned up for the anti war rally by the final leg of it.
t1_dth66rt	1	*	If only...if only...if only....
t1_dtgm5id	0	*	How can something that hasn't even happened yet be fake?  Think about shit for a moment before spouting off like some idiot.   You could have also said - THIS NEWS SOUNDS ... NOT LIKELY. 
t1_dthk2zi	0	*	So what you're saying is that you want London to be wiped off the map?
t1_dtfo1l3	0	*	The people who couldn't get to work because the roads were blocked with freedom fighters will vote the the opposite of whatever said freedom fighters want. 
t1_dtgj2ow	1	*	Not much. The globalist controlled mainstream media machine has just brainwashed the population into thinking Trump is the next Hitler that will end the world. Sad really.
t1_dsdt6a9	1	*	How many gangs send in a young child to pick up the acid before using it themselves? I think that would be a better question. 
t1_duxinaf	0	*	And then, there was the lowly Tardigrade.
t1_dtn6wfo	1	*	Best comment so far.
t1_dtnjntt	1	*	There was no **in campaign** besides fear mongering. The people voted for all they were told.
t1_dtnn7vz	0	*	This is the one thing I just cant reconcile amongst the current chaos of global politics - blatant disregard for facts/evidence/the scientific method 
t1_dtn2kb6	0	*	If the economy tanks then how do other problems get solved? 
t1_dtnj32b	1	*	i mean, they voted for brexit to bring economics back to the state when they were young and you could buy a house for cleaning the road with a broom.
t1_dtn266l	1	*	Its not like people wanted to hear it. Every economic analysis predicted gloom and doom before the vote.
t1_dto58le	1	*	The other point to make is either option is political suicide. Theresa May can't win. It would be better if she stopped pretending she can. The government will collapse anyway in the next few years.
t1_dtn3d5q	1	*	People reading about brown people in the Daily Mail 
t1_dtmhm2k	1	*	Typical human reaction. Loss aversion, or the sunk cost fallacy.
t1_dtmo893	1	*	Unfortunately, politicians are too scared of pissing off the stable geniuses on the far-right.
t1_dtnhzg4	1	*	not on snails?
t1_dtnrj2j	1	*	It was assumed that the population wouldn't want it. Old geezers did, and now they are screwed.
t1_dtni347	1	*	Yeah, I would think that leavers dont believe in the EU institution and bureaucracy. And that its the better long term solution that is more important a economic hit in the near term.
t1_dtmv3ob	0	*	It was an advisory referendum, not a binding one.  We have both.
t1_dtn3cu1	0	*	All these foreners coming into my cuntry. 
t1_dtmuiok	1	*	let's ignore the vote of the people 
t1_dtn4t2g	1	*	leaving it just to spend more money to participate in it isn't a way to make progress either  Plus it means any progress made will be at your expense
t1_dtmeqwp	0	*	keeps the analysts off the streets drinking, and yelling profanities at old ladies, maybe even ride the odd moped  
t1_dtmue7z	1	*	if purposely covering up the reports that say it's going to be shit and then admitting it's going to be shit only after they've been leaked is being honest.....then yeah, she's being honest  
t1_dtn5n26	0	*	> it wasnt because were racist xenophobia either.  I honestly don't see what your point about North Korea is supposed to be, *other* than xenophobia.
t1_dtn55yc	1	*	It was Economic Aniety
t1_dto8cis	1	*	It did, every economist said this would happen
t1_dtnt26a	0	*	The Independent is reported for being sensationalized?  I call a bunch right-wing trolls who cannot stand to hear a fresh objective point of view.
t1_dtn34fp	1	*	It did. But nobody reported it. British media was busy spreading gross lies about the EU and reporting about buses full of bullshit.  
t1_dtncorq	0	*	Yeah... people act like democracy is the holy grail, but it really isn't, as you can see with brexit
t1_dtnxc94	1	*	I just cant forget when that fucker fought for something and when its time to do it he just leaves. The UK politics is just a clown

t1_dup7m4b	1	*	Remember if anything bad ever happens to you and your loved ones, don't seek justice don't seek revenge, don't even tell the police about it. Because there is bigger shit happening in Syria 
t1_dse6lkj	0	*	The Baha'i temple in Santiago, Chile is also an architectural masterpiece. It truly looks out of this world, yet it is firmly grounded in what spiritual architecture should be about. 
t1_dsek4on	1	*	Allah'u'Abhxe1, brother!
t1_dsguikz	0	*	Not all of those countries are neighbors to Iraq, they are just in the same region. Iraq only has a border with some of those countries and in those countries Bahai can't celebrate openly.

t1_dt3ulik	1	*	It's weird to see people from non football countries talking about him as if he's a politician.   This guy was the best football player in the world! 
t1_dt34u4s	0	*	Liberia never qualified for the world cup
t1_dunfb4z	0	*	I saw a post on facebook today saying reddit was the least neckbeard community. Pointed them to this comment. Got blocked immediately.  What is it about Islam in the news that brings out all le edge?

t1_dsyk4uz	1	*	Nope. It's a matter of principal. Don't you have any principals?
t1_dsyj27z	1	*	Ridiculous. But everything about the last year has been a pantomime and this is no different. 
t1_dsyioo0	1	*	If your senator is one of the ones who voted against write to them and let him/her know you are unimpressed.
t1_dsyio8e	0	*	The President and the GOP put forth a clean bill, without any demands whatsoever. This is just the Democrats throwing a hissy fit that they don't like the will of the American people.
t1_dsyk677	1	*	What if it doesn't blow over? This is a black swan event. The government will fracture and we won't have a republic.

t1_dt8gmvd	0	*	Polands migration rate has been negative since over 50 years and had a HUGE spike in 2000 (-10%). Poland even has to ease their employment laws because workers are leaving.

t1_du61o7q	1	*	I'm glad Europe is distancing itself from America. What's not even imaginable in any other country is perfectly sane in the US no matter how moronic it might be. 
t1_du614j9	0	*	it's either t shirts and planting trees, or standing on the border in the freezing cold staring at emptiness.

t1_duidcq9	0	*	The term whirling dervish has nothing to do with fighting.  It's a type of dance/meditation they do that involves spinning around.
t1_ds1shxc	0	*	But that would require a chest-thumping military force to admit defeat...
t1_du51o2h	1	*	They could also put lasers and railguns on them. Solar powered. Quantum entanglement.
t1_du3wzbr	1	*	It's not really suppose to stack up against the F35. The J 20 has a longer range and payload capacity than the F35. But the F 35 is more manverable. These two planes were made for different purposes. 
t1_du472od	1	*	Yeah China should have just bought something like what your country did.

t1_dsw1ujw	1	*	It is and damnit, u/theburningundead beat me to posting it here! i hope he makes it to front page! Really exciting time to be a young woman in NZ. 
t1_dsxs41q	0	*	Comments like these have me convinced that a lot of you have never actually met a pregnant person. Life is not TV, pregnant women are no more a slave to their emotions than you or I. 
t1_dswx1cn	1	*	...And the Prime Minister blows on the pie, as is tradition.
t1_dsx0tf8	0	*	only 37? that is old for having a child. Not to mention (still small but) double the chance for chromosome birth defect

t1_dunttmg	1	*	Much better than never. Let's not blame a relative newcomer like Macron for the inaction of other people 
t1_duntwke	1	*	The difference is Macron has competence in other fields than immigration reform, whereas that's about all National Front gives a shit about. It's better to have experienced people

t1_dsn0laj	0	*	Adding Venezuelan food to UNESCO's cultural treasure at this point would be in very poor taste, since the country is starving over their half wit leader's incompetence.
t1_duutafe	1	*	Well they are doing that by moving people to poisonous areas. Can't say that I'm a fan. Also it would be more beneficial to reduce westerners, since one of us uses much more resources. 
t1_duuqvbq	1	*	Terrible urban planning is an important part of Indian culture and everyone condemning this vibrant expression of the Indian way of life is a bigot.
t1_dv38t8n	1	*	About as much as American politicians, except Americans like you call it lobbying, we call it what it is.

t1_duw8x9n	1	*	Yeah it's just like I thought.   ISOBEL Thompson's article history is more indicitive of a biased redditor with too much free time than it is a journalist.
t1_duvzt60	1	*	He admitted [he can't control the drug problem](http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2017/08/12/Duterte-war-on-drugs-cant-control-drug-problem.html), if that gives you any idea how it's going.
t1_duw6rmy	1	*	It's actual fake news. I'm sure some die hard Trumpets probably love articles like this as more proof of fake news. It feels like it invalidates articles that report on actual issues.

t1_dsjirde	0	*	I dont think were ever going to be respected again. Maybe a OK, theyre not as shitty as they used to be.
t1_dsjjbs0	1	*	It's not a great idea. If Netherlands expels USA's ambassador, then the usual reaction is for the USA in turn to expel Netherlands' ambassador.
t1_dsjkb3v	1	*	Exaggeration, this guy just made up shit now they are calling him out. And why is this not news?

t1_dsjb3fc	1	*	I like how he had to remind him, this is important
t1_dsjmqw6	1	*	So something completely different then?
t1_dsjh84k	0	*	I disagree.  We also don't refuse the ambassador of Saudi Arabia, because he doesn't see women as his equals. Nor does Saudi Arabia refuse ambassadors of other countries that are women.
t1_dsjhh9f	1	*	They lie like they breathe; what frickin' line. Good work.
t1_dsjf93q	1	*	Except that's literally the opposite of what happened.

t1_dsk8jzb	1	*	It's the Dutch's fault, really
t1_dsjeooy	1	*	When I read it I first read it as burned as in taking a chance and getting burned. Not sure if that makes it true or not, but people are focusing way more on literal burnt politicians than I was.
t1_dsjq3ue	1	*	This is the Netherlands you need to respond to questions. Missing it
t1_dsjg07a	1	*	Oh man thats terrible, you guys shouldn't have done that.  I read somewhere that if you distress your prey too much their body releases lactic acid and it spoils the meat.
t1_dsjdlae	1	*	I mean, yeah they're all pretty bad, but I don't recall any of them being this bad.  The bar has been set at -5. This dude's like a -10.
t1_dsjmbtt	1	*	Blaming the President for what the ambassador said? No.   Blaming the President for picking him as Ambassador knowing his past remarks would cause a problem?    Yeah...
t1_dsjmrub	1	*	Sources? Is it so prevalent as to say they rather than some individuals?
t1_dsjg1mz	1	*	Maybe not burned but definitely blew something up. What are they doing in the Netherlands anyways? Enough of this European guilt.

t1_dsj45bf	1	*	Not relevant to the post
t1_dsjkew9	1	*	Too soon
t1_dsjrma7	1	*	Dont be U0001f60a we had a good laugh and think our press did the same U0001f609
t1_dsjj4a6	1	*	But it wasn't the truth. This whole thing is about how when he was confronted with the fact that it wasn't the truth, he refused to respond.
t1_dsjct5o	1	*	Well at least we could send someone who isnt a fuckwit. I mean, thats the absolute LEAST we could do. 
t1_dsk8wvq	0	*	Clearly the same thing...

t1_duyr2ap	1	*	Thanks for the detailed analysis!

t1_dv4u9b1	1	*	Shhhhh we're not ready for that
t1_dt1oebd	1	*	That's not entirely wrong, but it's kind of fucked up because apartheid was a monstrous program that demonized and exploited an entire race of people.
t1_dt1wqh4	0	*	thatcher was an absolute cunt, a terrible person  her relationship with south Africa isn't a secret, she saw mandela as a terrorist
t1_dt1ywpv	0	*	It's ZA. SA is a totally different country. We picked SA first.

t1_dt4z7tj	1	*	Is that the new soundbite after nothingburger? 
t1_dt87ga2	1	*	It helps that pretty much everyone is corrupt in Saudi, so the Crown Prince can truthfully say he's going after corrupt people, while coincidently taking out his opponents...

t1_duevjxl	1	*	In the 21st century, you don't even need controlled opposition anymore.  Those at the top are a bit more *structurally* secure than in previous eras, although maybe not personally.
t1_dufidzi	1	*	It means a headline writer wanted something more impactful than using criticises/condemns  every time.
t1_dseh3rk	0	*	Yeah looks like Northrup Grumman or Government contractor messed up the payload separation adapter.
t1_dtefvyp	0	*	What kind of short sighted authoritarian would beg for government censorship of political speech? This is repulsive.
t1_dtpawbq	0	*	You mean that one Island with the most popular city for Russian Cronies?
t1_dtbenl4	1	*	When my case was trashed by BA, I filled out a form at Heathrow and a new case, better quality than original, arrived the following week. 15+ years ago so obviously it's very different now...
t1_ds42cao	1	*	Indeed. Not going to be a quick win here.
t1_du4jpxl	1	*	What? I would say that one is on you, my dear Americans, as those shitheads are clearly taking after Mr. -Carotene. What they want is essentially Fox News, or worse (Breitbart or Infowars).
t1_du4rgwl	1	*	Hitler had Hugenberg as backing. Thats a bit more then those 20 guys can do.
t1_du5i66p	0	*	Desert Fox News.
t1_du4mgc4	1	*	You hit the nail on the head so well. Couldn't agree more. 
t1_du5hjaw	1	*	Let's hope somebody can track their signal back to their broadcast room and put them off the air. Hopefully permanently.
t1_dsmuwpk	1	*	You mean Enemy Combatants, don't you...?
t1_duros86	1	*	Lol thanks for the laugh. 
t1_durqpo4	0	*	It hasn't. 
t1_durfs0s	0	*	trickle down?  trump likes trickle down, the literal kind.
t1_dusa2yw	1	*	They only ever actually removed ***maybe*** a third of the guns, at best.  It's hardly a surprise.
t1_dura40m	1	*	*cough* *cough* water please.
t1_durb91w	1	*	Yeah I'm pretty sure the US has higher rates than Australia in almost every type of crime there is.
t1_durcxn7	0	*	My dude was basically sucking Trump's dick during that presser. Embarrassing.
t1_durps35	0	*	Yet restricting certain types of weapons has made such a huge difference regardless of that. Go figure!
t1_durm4e5	0	*	It's not news, Trump didn't even ask for advice, the title is extremely misleading.
t1_dus9efw	1	*	Maybe this, plus the fact that they romanticise guns and violence/military so much.
t1_dur8wlu	0	*	Emotion tends to be more decisive than reason even to the most rational people. Whether we like it or not that's how people ultimately vote.
t1_dus38hr	1	*	Trying to teach a pig to sing is a waste of your time, and irritates the pig. 
t1_durwxay	1	*	He's a fucking red tie blow hard. Basically sucking trump and the rest of the rights dick and then afterwards acting like this. Two-faced politicians who lie to the public to look good.
t1_dus9ivt	1	*	I wish Australia had these gun laws. I think it's a good compromise. Also airguns are illegal in Australia.
t1_dus23yk	1	*	Not at all. Are you embarrassed by Trump in general?
t1_dusrc3c	1	*	Yep, surprised it didnt come from the Guardian... Absolute shockers these days.
t1_dus2xft	1	*	Guns laws here are in need of an overhaul anyway. They are not as strict as people make out, nowhere near. Shooters and Fishers (and the NRA) are chipping away at them.
t1_dus99mf	0	*	Why does the collapsible stock matter? Why the arbitrary magazine limit? Why not 5, or 3. What about 10 or 30?  It's all based on feel good legislation, nothing substantial. 
t1_dusgyt6	0	*	> It will take generations to make the USA safe from guns.  There are more guns in australia than before the confincation...  
t1_dur9gbw	1	*	Lol.
t1_dus3ybg	1	*	Given trumps full support to the NRA it could caused a war
t1_duri34k	1	*	He's not too busy to campaign against same-sex marriage though. At least he's spending his time on the real issues.
t1_durforn	1	*	>Current PM can't even control his Deputy shooting loads into the staffers,  [GOD DAMN!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTqtrGBYpxQ)
t1_dudr5z9	1	*	Probably. This seems like the type of divisive shit they would focus on.
t1_dudlwb0	0	*	Read the article.
t1_dudozit	1	*	Ive always been a father Russia kind of guy 
t1_dudncl1	1	*	Because God forbid someone different gets it any better than them.  
t1_dudqnkt	0	*	Because if we let someone restrict speech someone further down the line will have precedent for restricting speech further.
t1_dudnen0	1	*	What?  The Marvel universe is not black.
t1_dudrdh6	1	*	Did you even read the article? It was a Swedish woman who got attacked by a man for refusing his advances at a bar. 
t1_dudqla1	1	*	Marvel's Avengers: Infinity War
t1_dudna4b	1	*	God youre dumb.  They arent lying unless they are in which case its a good thing.

t1_dt9xilw	0	*	Even Sean Hannity said that Fox News sources confirmed the story too lol
t1_dueo2ba	1	*	That's what the US thought in 1941 about Japan. 1942 showed them otherwise.
t1_dufw8r7	1	*	....is this comment ordered by the Strategic Fooyou Agency?  I can't tell these days.
t1_du9l5fc	1	*	Sort of, yeah.
t1_du8z03q	0	*	Actually it's Azerbaijan. One of Israel's biggest customers for arms. 
t1_dua1sjq	0	*	Israel just declared moral bankruptcy. The most prominent victim of genocide denied recognition of others who suffered the same gruesome fate. How low can you sink...
t1_du91zc3	0	*	Is it the genocide of the Syrian people? Or do you have some underhanded nonsense to imply instead?
t1_du9awsj	0	*	I agree 100%. I am a huge Israel supporter, and this shit makes me sick to my stomach.  It's even worse when you consider the Armenian population in Israel. 
t1_du8xhvr	0	*	Then I guess a lot of countries are now committing genocide because they refuse to recognize the Armenian genocide.
t1_dua87oa	0	*	Didn't the recognition only happen recently?
t1_du9h8m9	1	*	Nothing about the wiki page says hes a Jew though. Only thing with Jews about it was him working in a school for Jews and having an affair with one.
t1_du98ej3	1	*	This is the opposite of that, it's pandering to Turkey
t1_du9ltwi	1	*	Not even sort of. 
t1_du9377g	0	*	Lmao now watch what happens when you stop recognizing Jewish holocaust because of political reasons. What a hilarious little group they are.
t1_dsnkeyh	1	*	how does your comment make any sense
t1_dv0bz0n	1	*	There are no homeless in Norway.
t1_dshs358	1	*	Considering that the auto industry is still one of the largest unionized industries in America, do you find it surprising that the Republican camp is out to destroy what's left of the industry?
t1_dtzq2jo	1	*	You can thank the west and it's imperial ambitions for this.
t1_du07psk	1	*	So obviously you didn't read the Reuters article
t1_dsdmj0m	1	*	If an awful idiot like Trump can do it because he was a TV show host any TV show host can do it.  Trump and the GOP have lowered the bar so such depths that Satan uses it for chin-ups.
t1_dsdp0gl	0	*	Are you referring to Reagan?
t1_dtzpz05	0	*	Exmormon?
t1_dshqmtd	1	*	They'll catch sick waves though!

t1_duandtr	1	*	USA, Canada, music industry.
t1_duiwjki	1	*	I don't think Pakistan wants a better relationship with India at all.

t1_duwr0xt	0	*	Two eyes for an eye?  Escalation.  
t1_dtlnai8	0	*	They are using 500 million litres per day. So I don't think that will help. 
t1_dtwbyy0	1	*	nah this is the country that was harboring terrorists and lying to us about it. Oh crap wait, its the same one!
t1_dtx9h9u	1	*	Its literally a Muslim cess pool. And with their birth rate theyll proliferate through India again and take political power eventually. Islam is a cancer on society. 
t1_dtvt30t	1	*	It would have been unlawful not to hang him otherwise
t1_dsgi9ms	1	*	Some people abuse immodium, as it is an opioid.  Now those people are angry!!

t1_dup3zka	1	*	> It's just the wrong way to do things but is it making a difference?  I think even Duterte's admitted he had no idea what he was doing, though given his record of lying I dunno what to believe.
t1_duoyjx5	1	*	Fun fact:  The Japanese Police often considers murders as suicide. In general, crime statistics that come from Japan are often unreliable.
t1_duowxst	1	*	Pose a financial threat to the USA or pivot some more to China.  The USA supported Marcos  who has worse human rights violations thru and thru. Marcos was a staunch US ally.
t1_duowrut	0	*	>or cheap  The Philippines is a poor shithole, where can we get the money lol  I think his methods are ineffective and a bit too heavy-handed but being cheap is not a factor in this instance.
t1_duonpkr	1	*	For the record this is the same President who abruptly banned his citizens from going to work in Kuwait, over the deaths of 7 people.
t1_duo5lo4	1	*	I like the last one. Because it means that if the nation they live in ever decided to run itself by killing them, then they would be fine with it. 
t1_dtem1vz	1	*	Only way I can imagine it happening would be if he was holding it while having his back to the MRI machine.  Being sucked in by it pushing from the chest backwards into the machine.
t1_ds8qpoj	1	*	FLASHING LIGHTS, 100 PLOTS EVERY FEW MINUTES SEX SEX VIOLENCE, DOPAMINE FLUSH,   lol so explain how adhd cant be developped using media devices?

t1_dteglgz	1	*	You do realise you can both work and be homeless?
t1_dteh0es	0	*	Oh my god no tiny pay cuts to politicians and even tinier tax increases so the homeless may have a chance at a decent life. How could they ever do such a selfish thing.
t1_dtgah6d	0	*	That would literally be the end of the world.
t1_dtga8lr	1	*	Stop being a defeatist or a shill. It's more important to stress to people the peril the great nation we live in is facing.
t1_dt4355u	1	*	Haha, thank you for making me giggle. How about you Turks fuck off, your state is as real as Israel.

t1_duz08r7	0	*	Not her given name though
t1_duzom1x	0	*	Isn't that the guy who ran on a pro sex campaign as opposition in russia? Would make sense he's a puppet if so

t1_duzt9dj	1	*	this is awesome.  totally agree.  but she is in a cage, and pretty hot.   i hope she makes it safely back home
t1_duz9smy	0	*	funny cause her last name translates I to fish so it's like nasty fish
t1_dv1333t	1	*	ready made for the inevitable Trump nickname.
t1_duzlwdd	1	*	What ever gets you off man
t1_duzgzr4	1	*	Follow the pee trail 
t1_duzl8xp	1	*	This isn't about being left or right leaning. Both sides don't like corruption, this Russian escort apparently has proof of said corruption. Let the lady speak.
t1_duzkg93	1	*	Every person connected with this administration seems to have comically-relevant names, starting with Trump himself.
t1_dv1qcbi	0	*	I got real super dry looking at that photo.      I cant imagine how she is happy, her whole life is being Alex Lesleys whore, money, and being a troublemaker.

t1_dt18cze	1	*	How exactly is that natural selection?
t1_dt195zf	1	*	Prohibition is doing exactly what it was designed to do.  Fuck over everyone so gangsters can profit.  The gangsters took over america in the 1920s and they are still in charge now.
t1_dt1edft	1	*	The people will eventually choose to have their own once they realize that due process is less valuable to them than not having their family be butchered while still alive.

t1_dt1yhig	1	*	This is why you fight fire with thunder.

t1_ds4npms	0	*	The high water level is because of a storm. Storms happen with or without climate change. Maybe they will happen more often than before now, but the storm itself is not really special.

t1_dui0ec3	1	*	They don't have a human conscious they're just fucked up dirty animals
t1_du6gsul	1	*	Well all men die at some point. Honestly it depends on how he handles his underlings. He shuts up and does what his underlings wants him to do he could last a long time in office.

t1_du6lwzw	1	*	She hits you with a chesterfield?
t1_dui00jw	1	*	Lol. Its funny how people still blame right wing politics when the obvious truth is that uncontrolled immigration, especially from the EU has caused this
t1_dui16q6	0	*	Move closer to work then (no need for a car) or look at bigger career changes. A 30% increase is nothing to shout home about even if you get it. 30% net increase maybe
t1_duhxiu3	0	*	cool, you know it's the EU that is responsible for the poverty in half of western Europe right?

t1_dui2qyz	1	*	The data in the article is from 2007-2014.   You might want to start actually *reading* articles instead of just spouting off lazy platitudes about baby boomers based on the headline. 
t1_duihx5x	1	*	Is it bad that I thought it was ends meat until now? 
t1_dui3i8n	1	*	Finally someone said it! If these kids would just stop getting new phones the whole economy would be fixed!
t1_duij44z	0	*	And this is why the UK voted to leave the EU. No point having one of the strongest economies in the world if people don't feel it in their pockets.
t1_dui5ez4	0	*	Please at least mention once in your post what an abbreviation means because now I'm just sitting here confused reading SF 5 times and having no clue what it means lol.
t1_duhz1cs	0	*	Because the EU just keeps on giving to Greece, doesn't it?
t1_duicci0	1	*	Well theyre about to be shut out of 27 countries where that was less of an issue.  Of course theres always the option to become a teacher then leave, really sticks it to the system too.

t1_duj6p1x	1	*	I like that analogy.
t1_duikjxe	1	*	Well, the millennials were in the forefront of supporting immigration and population growth while pissing all over the working class. I got no sympathy for them, eat what you cooked.

t1_dui1nh7	1	*	Great, deep insight. Thanks for that. 
t1_dt8ekt3	1	*	Other US crops like wheat, corn, cotton and sorghum seem to be holding up better. Companies. will have to R&D to compete internationally.

t1_dtszc48	0	*	Yes it was. People look at the pictures of Tehran from the 70's and think Iran was some kind of secular heaven. In reality, the country side of Iran has always been very conservative and religious. 
t1_dtszhfr	1	*	1) are* not is 2) they're defending a women's right to decide whether or not she wants to wear a headscarf
t1_dtt0gq5	1	*	>Drop headscarf **laws**   >Private choice  I understand that you have a hardon for hating feminists but this is irrelevant to the issue in Iran
t1_dttdzxa	1	*	Fun Fact:  Iran is not a democracy.

t1_dtt0570	1	*	Can we assume the number of woman who want it to be a private right would have been much higher? Fuck knows there must be some who answered dishonestly for fear of repercussion.
t1_dtsmqwj	0	*	Prior to the revolution, the average woman living in the big city didn't wear hijab. Women in rural areas did, and some in the big city did too.

t1_dsqkfp4	0	*	Indonesia is mostly Muslim, so anti-vaxxers in Indonesia are likely going to be muslim. Just adding that.
t1_dsplcu4	1	*	Except anti-vaxxers don't just endanger themselves, but also anyone who may not be able to be vaccinated for medical reasons. So they'd also be killing a lot of innocent people.

t1_dtuae1u	0	*	You're Donald Trump's lawyer and you're scared he might lie? Shocker.
t1_dtu0l74	1	*	That's because Sessions is also a lawyer and knows when it's better to keep his mouth shut.  The Cheeto is a salesman, not a lawyer.  Complete opposite mentality.
t1_dtt0v9b	0	*	Subpoena for what exactly?
t1_dttmgsi	1	*	It Wasn't the POTUS, it was his scapegoat lawyer who tweeted the lies
t1_dtugb20	0	*	What specifically do you think Trump is guilty of?
t1_dttoq6m	0	*	It's a crime to lie to the FBI whether you're under oath or not. Hillary's conditions won't save Trump if his lawyers are worried he will lie.
t1_dttlqmx	1	*	Its way beyond collusion. Money Laundering and violating Trade Sanctions with Syria and Iran.
t1_dtsy038	1	*	>say something he will regret.  Do you have proof Trump is capable of regret, though?  I don't see it
t1_dttnua5	1	*	They'd be better off putting it on FOX tonight, our president doesn't read the news too much.

t1_duf3jwp	1	*	There is some sweet irony there, yes.
t1_dv3aqw2	0	*	Technically, the kick could have been called a Savate chassxe9.  Would that be less offensive to you because of the implied Whiteness?

t1_ds7n06b	1	*	Nah. If anything he can use it to prove himself right by suggesting there was never a problem, and that it was under him that it was revealed. 
t1_ds7kb19	0	*	Acid rain was a problem we fixed too. The dead forests from my childhood are almost completely recovered.  Also: lead in the atmosphere. 
t1_ds7qeid	1	*	To be fair ..the article about this paper is already sensatialized and bias from the get go.  The author is trolling for clicks to his hyped article
t1_ds845d7	1	*	He also invented a system of ropes and pulleys that got him out of bed as he became disabled, which ultimately strangled and killed him one day.
t1_ds7tv8w	1	*	Great speech, why did you use America when playing out the what ifs of the cold war?

t1_du70267	0	*	Yesterday Trump Jrs wife opened an envelope that contained white powder. She was sent to the hospital as a pre cautionary measure. 
t1_dtq26xn	1	*	I think it's more of the perception that trump is racist and overall incapable of being a leader by most of the world that makes her embarrassed.

t1_dtf43oz	0	*	Unfortunately in this country you only have to be popular in the right areas. 
t1_dtepisy	1	*	Well, we do know he has trouble counting. To him, small crowds are big. So even a small crowd of protesters will be big and that is scary.

t1_dsx5i98	1	*	Ive decided to retire young. Thanks for the fish. Catch yas later. 
t1_dsxmh3s	1	*	Not sure how having aquatic or marine mammals perform in shows precludes them from being in rehabilitation and vice versa.

t1_dsx55op	1	*	I knew that dolphins were smart, but damn. Thanks for the existential crisis.
t1_dsx9br6	1	*	Not entirely true. The belugas were part of a breeding program. None of them were rescues. 
t1_dsxkxo6	1	*	The animals WILL still be in captivity, they're just being moved to a different facility, presumably one that's less equipped and will be worse for them.  This horrible no matter how you look at it.

t1_dsxtga8	1	*	Nope, that is the program they are stopping now.  The catch and release rehabilitation program will continue.  Imprisoning and training them to do tricks will cease (supposedly).
t1_dsxt1z0	0	*	We have the internet now.  No need to kidnap intelligent animals and lock them in tiny featureless cement enclosures for decades just so kids can look at them for a minute.
t1_dsxgu79	0	*	Blatantly untrue. Zoos and aquariums are incredibly important for animal conservation. 
t1_dsx75np	1	*	That's a bingo.

t1_dsx506q	1	*	I thought I once heard that the animals become dependent on humans. They slowly lose the ability to find food in the wild. 
t1_dsxonzv	1	*	Lol did i get downvoted for assumed sarcasm? Octopuses are really smart creatures 
t1_dsx899b	1	*	But hey, the rescues that they do get to take in on a reduced budget after this can them be so lucky as to be transferred to sea world after the fact....   Such a frustrating situation.

t1_dtwqc7f	1	*	I say to just let them eat their cake.
t1_dsf5qhp	1	*	Apple should have just made the slowdown optional and notified the user about their battery health. The way they just slow down the phones with no explanation is IMO very much planned obsolescence.

t1_dtuw5rv	0	*	They don't have a clue how anything works. 90% of the reasoning (if you can call it that) for any opinion is nonsense. 
t1_dtvb7tw	1	*	The EU isn't suggesting a trade embargo, they're just refusing to negotiate a free trade agreement. The EU can't be harmed by maintaining the status quo... 
t1_dtvdit3	1	*	Everyone loves a captive audience. The consumers will probably not be very happy.
t1_dtvew3c	0	*	>  It's unrealistic for the EU to refuse trade deals with the US.  Yeah sure the EU would gladly bend over for trump.

t1_dsrh57m	0	*	I would like to see how this kid turns out in a few years.   No doubt he's been indoctrinated-- hopefully he can be rehabilitated.   That innocence on his face gets me right in the feels. 
t1_dsrl6pp	1	*	What's one more kid? You think when the bomb goes off they ensure there are no kids in the blast area? There's no value given to life, they just want to cause damage.

t1_dsuyjn6	1	*	Wanna split an avocado?
t1_dtrj5xb	0	*	Sadly it is and has been incredibly common for quite some time. The Spanish inquisition only ended in 1834, and then we have the Holocaust, the Rohingya, religious conflicts in India etc.

t1_dukp0dy	0	*	No this is just war. Civilian deaths are unavoidable. 
t1_dul3r4k	1	*	>Middle East - war over    Good joke
t1_dukposb	1	*	I am not a fan of the rebels but a few mortar shells isn't the same as indiscriminate bombardment. 
t1_duoc30s	1	*	Because Russia keeps using their veto to prevent action being taken.
t1_dun9eap	1	*	Depends who you ask and depends what news source you take as gospel. Instead of agitating maybe you could provide some good source material for both of your statements. 
t1_duljmm4	1	*	Since when Russia armed rebel groups and helped them take arms against the Syrian government and its people? I'm pretty sure the Syrian rebels are proudly US backed. 
t1_duobkcd	1	*	The scores of children being killed don't care about which definition of rebel you use.

t1_dscyb1e	1	*	Yea, but only the US is allowed to do all that invadey stuff 
t1_dsbwp8f	0	*	It's a secret because it would break an international agreement about the size of war games, but obviously Russia has let everyone know they did it anyway, just not officially.

t1_dsc9pan	1	*	Nobody wins.  The real answer.
t1_dsbpi3v	1	*	Lmao, this.

t1_dsbw566	1	*	You'd love the news in Greece where serious newspapers and tv stations have extensive coverage on Bild's coverage of internal issues
t1_dsc53w8	1	*	As other comments have said it's because they lied about the number of troops they had, saying a number that would disallow foreign observation, hence breaking an international agreement

t1_dsbyipm	1	*	Really big holodeck.
t1_dsc6wj7	1	*	Russia feels impunied by loosing the cold war in the 90's, because of that they want to restore it's greatness. Russia blames US and it's western allies for everything bad in the country.

t1_dsbr1t3	1	*	You just unplug the nuclear button, push it to see if it still works and, then plug it in again.

t1_dv031q9	1	*	I hate to say it, but basically things are panning out exactly like the pro-Apartheid people said it would.  South Africa is turning back into a typical sub-saharan African nation.

t1_dv02dli	1	*	You didn't know that that was a lot of violent conflict between blacks and whites before Apartheid? It's not like white people wanted a separation just because they thought black people were icky.
t1_dv03ind	1	*	either way the government will probably take it from you when you get there
t1_dv01lt0	0	*	Was there a vote or wasn't there?
t1_dv02ou6	1	*	No kidding.  I have a feeling that this will not go well.
t1_duzzc0h	0	*	> This just stuns me as I considered South Africa much like Australia in many ways.  We don't have 90% blacks in Australia.  Edit: Oh fuck off getting triggered. This isnt even racist.
t1_duzzq0e	1	*	Holy shit
t1_dv087v3	1	*	L'espoir fait vivre! Hope gives life, you hope boikie!
t1_dv03kpz	1	*	The only thing an extremist hates more than an enemy is a heretic.  To a racial extremist, mixed people are an abomination.

t1_dv0es8s	1	*	The person who said this, Julius Malema, is the leader of the 3rd largest party in SA. He is not in government.

t1_duzyssj	1	*	now your place white boy
t1_dv05hls	0	*	Except for Mozambique most of Southern Africa is pretty stable. None of the stability can be attributed to SA. 
t1_dv07seh	1	*	They're not gonna starve because after they kill all the white people, white people will send them foreign aid.

t1_dv06zan	1	*	Does Australia have some connections to South Africa?
t1_dv0fhb4	1	*	Is it better to be a starving free man or a well fed slave? When you are one you wish to be the other.
t1_duzx2b4	0	*	How is this right?
t1_dv0a80u	0	*	Yes, become one country made a mistake, lets try not to do anything.  If blacks owned 72% of Australias land you'd be screaming and crying murder every day.
t1_dv01cg1	1	*	*unlike  (I feel you tho)
t1_dv02e5e	1	*	Nah it's not.  What we did to the rest of the world was taking what belonged to them.  What South Africa is doing is taking back what's theirs.
t1_dv07l82	0	*	GTFO as soon as you can mate.  Fly to a western country on a holiday visa and claim asylum if you can't get a permanent Visa.
t1_dv03n7y	1	*	you do understand the concept of puppet governments and clandestine destabilization right? like how france purposely fueled years of war in the congo? how usa attacked numerous revolutions?

t1_dv0921y	1	*	Yup, South African govnerment, Trump and his cronies and racist supporters all should act like the monkeys they are.
t1_dv02l1e	0	*	>This is quite frustrating as it basically kills a lot of foreign investment or any immigration for that matter  It also kills people. That must be pretty frustrating.
t1_dv00vg9	0	*	In accurate article from the Daily Mail. This hasn't been voted on. It would be terrible for the country if it passed though.
t1_dv04yfw	0	*	Kenya guess whos Ghana have to step up? 
t1_dv018md	1	*	White people needed their special-ness, otherwise, they start shooting schools.   That said, you know fully well that there will definitely be land owned by farmers taken away. 
t1_duzyut8	1	*	I think this started in 2014. And by 2016 they were asking for aid because people were starving. Not to mention all the crimes against the white farmers who've been killed, brutalized, and raped.
t1_duzyv0k	0	*	> legitimate refugees, unless like 99% of the people currently let in as refugees  Not entirely sure what you mean by this.

t1_dv02ayn	0	*	How did those whites get the land originally? It was during colonization right?. Did they originally pay the blacks for the land ?

t1_dv027tv	0	*	True, we were becoming better at respecting everyone until Trump came along.
t1_duzz0qt	0	*	Fucking awesome 
t1_dv003mg	1	*	Those who forget history are doomed to repeat it. Oh well, let them run their country into the ground. I feel sorry for those who opposed this decision, but will suffer for it anyways. 
t1_dv00n9h	1	*	Because the boers took ownership of nearly all of the land. It's a dumb economic policy for the long term though.
t1_dv02m16	1	*	It's not like we haven't seen this before in africa.  Very close to SA as a matter of fact.   
t1_dv01glt	1	*	No they wont. Fucking over whites in former colonies is seen as a fuck yeah! Thing in most of the world unfortunately. 
t1_dv066wh	1	*	Based on the comments following all of the deleted comments, it seems like they're pulling links to evidence of ethnic cleansing, but why?
t1_duzxcnk	0	*	I personally havent seen black panther yet but from my understanding of it SA is acting more like the villain in that movie than the hero.
t1_duzzf3p	1	*	Doesnt make for a sensational news story.  The peace and happiness story doesnt sell. 
t1_dv01m9z	1	*	I really wish DA would be able to take over some national power, if for no other reason than to give ANC some competition.

t1_dv2t65y	1	*	It's been going great for Israel!

t1_dv05wm7	0	*	Two different events can both occur? It doesn't have to be just one or the other???
t1_dv00knt	1	*	Well, it's not Israel or the United States, so most likely not.  Maybe a sternly worded letter from Hans Brix
t1_duzvnvc	1	*	Or you could use the much, much more obvious example of Zimbabwe. Also Cuba is one of the better places in Latin America to live now.
t1_dv05wlb	0	*	The US should happily take them in - and others.    
t1_dv00ry4	1	*	The rest of Africa?  It's a pretty big continent with lots of different countries.  There are pretty developed places with big shiney buildings in other African countries you know.

t1_dv00oav	1	*	Same shit happened in Zimbabwe. Look at that shit storm.

t1_dv01vls	1	*	Sorry, honestly sad. That country is going to shit. I mean its a tough situation
t1_duzwlhz	1	*	Nelson Mandela must be rolling in his grave
t1_duzy938	1	*	Whites have always been a minority in Africa.
t1_dv0ae92	1	*	No, this is why we need to educate our kids about racism, hate, empathy, and why we should stand up against people like Trump and the South African government.
t1_dv05tei	1	*	Holy fuck shitting myself with laughter. 
t1_dv03y03	1	*	This is a good idea.
t1_dv0569n	1	*	Burning fertilizes the soil. Salt and motor oil that bitch.

t1_dv027ja	1	*	You should really listen to what the furher has to say if you haven't heard anything racist from a government , though recently I would say the saudis, 
t1_dv00iza	0	*	Is there any citation on this? Its sounds like a strong point but easily discredited

t1_dv051kg	1	*	Since when did investors start caring about human rights? Then again, the answer might turn out to be when it affects wealthy white people... 
t1_dv010rs	1	*	We never will. Look at who decides who gets to be considered a refugee. 
t1_dv02aey	1	*	Or was it right because it would have avoided this?

t1_dv00zx7	1	*	> They were not afraid to stand up against apartheid  How so?
t1_duzyxjc	0	*	They bought the land.
t1_dv09thv	1	*	Before colonialism the average african worked less than 20 hours a week and lived in a libertarian wet dream. Africa will be alright if the europeans and the arabs leave and never come back. 
t1_dv06l7d	1	*	I'm pretty sure the Western Cape would vote itself out of the country if this happened. The ANC isn't in power here.
t1_duzy26o	0	*	This seems like a great gesture
t1_dv017xr	1	*	Yeah man. Life was so much better when they were the ones doing the oppressing. 
t1_dv01lu9	0	*	Oh yeah everyone, they were only considering it and judging by the other stuff they have passed, this surely will pass as well. Definitely misrepresentation, everyone back off.
t1_dv0133t	1	*	This is the Soviet Union all over again. We need to arm these farmers and help them fight back.
t1_dv00ygp	1	*	I literally watched Invictus last night and it had me pumped for South Africa. This makes me less pumped.
t1_dv00vds	1	*	I think that's an ideal rather than a fact.
t1_dv03nu9	1	*	Well, this is news lol. But I do get your point.
t1_dv02xzm	0	*	A similar percent in america commits a similar percent of crime. Are we going to say blacks have it coming? or what?
t1_dv01wpm	1	*	> Write an email and a fax and a letter and make a call to the Trump admin.  Eeeehh.. I don't know if I trust them to handle this without getting cringy. Can I send a letter to someone else?

t1_dv063hr	1	*	If their paper currency is edible.
t1_duzzadz	1	*	So they should have slaves.  Got it.
t1_dv019t7	0	*	Because its stealing. They arent even going to pay them for the land. Nobody should have their property or possessions taken from them for any reason. Thats a basic human right. 
t1_dv02q6a	1	*	Yup. Anywhere that blacks are empowered they destroy. Look at pictures of any major city in the US 60-80 years ago and compare them to now.

t1_dv00wfx	1	*	I also heard Nikki Haley takes calls from anyone claiming to be a prime minister or a European country and has an opinion on even the tiniest islands/ countries, real or not!
t1_dv07dc7	1	*	> Whites still own most of South Africas land following centuries of brutal colonial dispossession.
t1_dv0000a	1	*	No... Just wipe the colonizers traces off the land so that China can trade with them more freely.
t1_dv02ivq	1	*	Huh? They're returning land to its original owners, not discriminating against anyone based on their race. 
t1_dv0far1	0	*	I wish I could. Salt the ground and get the fuck out of there, man. I'm rooting for you.   Just a question... are a lot of whites in SA considering leaving atm?

t1_dutxmmd	1	*	Because NPR is a tool of the establishment....you expect them to not push propaganda?
t1_durrjym	0	*	Unfortunately, I am afraid the same propaganda will work again and again ad infinitum until the U.S. gets btfo by all the global karma they've been accruing for the last hundred plus years.
t1_dury9kx	1	*	In addition to what others have said - There's also literally nowhere for them to go.

t1_dschs1j	1	*	Atheists should be forbidden from driving electric cars. They should only drive benzine based cars. And a Christian guardian should be assigned to prevent the godless from driving astray.

t1_ds3572n	1	*	Yeah but i'm still scared of being really high up :(
t1_ds30m6w	1	*	How do you know?
t1_ds33yiv	1	*	The only factor that matters = Trump.  /s
t1_ds2z5o8	1	*	Me too, not dying going to Ireland. 
t1_ds35z1j	1	*	Don't worry, Trump's got your back
t1_ds2u6f0	1	*	monopolies are almost more dangerous than the Russians these days
t1_ds2xv7i	1	*	Dont worry, Trump took credit for it. 
t1_ds2rrco	1	*	Congrats!
t1_ds3r8b6	1	*	Well, its kinda true...ish.
t1_ds2udui	1	*	Don't worry bby. It's not luck - It's talent
t1_ds2qen0	0	*	Graph awesomeness would improve if the number of flights per year was added!
t1_ds2qe9d	0	*	But that was intentional, so it doesn't count. 
t1_ds323qp	1	*	You can't say it's safer than walking... A fuck ton more people walk than fly.  Do the actual math, not from last year only... an average.
t1_ds2tm1j	1	*	McKinley....
t1_ds2rkwu	1	*	That won't stop our fearless orangutan from taking credit.  Edit: [called it](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/948195478428102657)
t1_ds2wx87	1	*	For a thing.
t1_ds376ty	0	*	That didn't happen.
t1_ds302yv	0	*	As someone who's scared shitless of flying! This made me feel better. I'm going to save this comment and maybe I'll make it to Switzerland one day
t1_ds31tpk	1	*	That is honestly incredible. Here's a great example of federal regulations being important. Thanks for keeping my friends, family, and fellow Americans safe while flying.  
t1_ds2v7q6	1	*	This comment was literally just tweeted out by the President.
t1_ds2von1	1	*	 He did. 
t1_ds3jzb0	1	*	The tittle and article specify it's commercial jet planes. 
t1_ds3k9ni	1	*	Not a jet plane
t1_ds2vicp	1	*	There it is  https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/948195478428102657
t1_ds2yl5x	0	*	I have heard that desensitization is the best approach to fear of flying. The first flight is the hardest but if you fly frequently after that it gets better. 
t1_ds2wt0p	0	*	He just did. No joke. 
t1_ds3bs7w	1	*	The dude would try to take credit for the sky being blue tomorrow.
t1_ds2u02f	1	*	Not deceptive at all. There were no commercial airliner fatalities this year. That's what the headline and article are talking about.
t1_ds2t4o7	0	*	Because thats the same as dying sure.
t1_ds3kdka	1	*	The article tittle is only about commercial airline jet planes, so first one is not jet, second one is charter and last two cargo planes so none goes in this statistic. 
t1_ds32lwg	1	*	Just got my a&p certs! So excited to start my career.
t1_ds3a48e	1	*	Than a major jet, there were plenty of smaller planes that crashed
t1_ds46vrr	1	*	You went to the future?
t1_ds2zj7n	0	*	and why not thank Trump for that beautiful solar eclipse he offered us while we're at it.
t1_ds2qw84	0	*	> when a helicopter crash killed 2 two people   --- > If the wings are traveling faster than the fuselage, it's probably a helicopter -- and therefore, unsafe.  Q.E.D.
t1_ds2sqd7	1	*	Thanks Obama?
t1_ds2r3dz	1	*	To be fair that was one shitty airline. Before that whole incident I've never heard good things from that airline. 
t1_ds2w0tj	1	*	https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/948195478428102657
t1_ds3iy6i	1	*	And how is it pretty obvious?
t1_ds2unvt	1	*	r/pewdiepiesubmissions
t1_ds2smaw	0	*	Its unquestionable that commercial flight was far more dangerous in the early days of aviation. The fact that there was no NTSB back then does not negate basic logic. 
t1_ds2ufzb	1	*	What's inaccurate about the title?
t1_ds2rhb3	0	*	He's choking on his food, quick, somebody shoot him
t1_ds2x7np	1	*	But trump took the credit so i guess that's why it's safe now
t1_ds2xhdn	1	*	Same, I took 8 flights last year and I am still alive.  
t1_ds39fqb	1	*	He already did
t1_ds2w3wd	1	*	r u a wizard
t1_ds2yw59	0	*	> my dudes  > my dude  I'm not your dude, buddy.
t1_ds3k26r	0	*	Was in 2014. 
t1_ds2r8h4	0	*	Is that an optional extra? 
t1_ds2qoxc	1	*	^Omg ^you^right   Can't be accidental if we did it on purpose U0001f914
t1_du7q6lw	1	*	So how long until David Icke get involved in this.
t1_dv2ze6h	0	*	You don't want to read a reddit thread about an article about a reddit thread? Do you even reddit bro?
t1_dv2xw1d	1	*	Bill Gates has pretty good insight into a major part of the global financial system every time he logs in to his bank account...
t1_dv15ma6	0	*	Hence mutually assured destruction hopefully prevents this from ever taking place.
t1_dtnlgi9	1	*	It is the original. It's the unredacted version.
t1_dtn6vn2	1	*	The memo Nunes wrote is a summary of a document containing many thousands of pages  only Gowdy & Schiff have seen that stuff, I think? 
t1_dv3ehav	1	*	If you trust Daily Mail and Yahoo News and read her quote, then yes. I am sure this is being downvoted and not read, I half expected this.
t1_dsgsyks	1	*	Thanks for the tip sir. And I agree with you all the way. 
t1_dtnt9eo	0	*	Check out the numbers for WWI
t1_dt9skox	1	*	I'm with Trump on that one, I wish I could date his daughter too...
t1_du0z8ul	0	*	Mate, Yojong(uc5ecuc815,) is Kim Jong Uns sister.
t1_dsvn8ep	1	*	Well, Tillerson just announced that US forces will remain in Syria indefinitely. If there is anything more definitive than a tweet, that would be it. 
t1_du57s5z	1	*	Antidepressants save people's lives and improve their quality of life. 
t1_dtwh5zz	1	*	Yes but they also understand that prison is for reformation to lessen a possible chance of recidivism.  The U.S private prisons require recidivism to run and make profit.
t1_dtwjo8u	1	*	You start by incarcerating your politicians and electing new ones.
t1_dtwo96q	1	*	If you guys have a hard time with these people killing themselves then just imagine they are another really late term abortion.
t1_dtwfvqm	0	*	When you join the civilised world, we'll think about it, but we have rules about extradition to third-world dumps ruled by wannabe despots.
t1_duxjdvj	1	*	Almost like different countries with different histories and context.
t1_duxmzb4	0	*	How is it not the time? We can't just keep brushing issues off to the side. This is a whole group of people (~50% of the world) that can't continue being treated like anything less than human. 
t1_duy4ifb	0	*	It reminds me of the quote, What if they threw a war, and nobody came?
t1_duxrw2q	1	*	Thank Obama for strengthening them, and even overlooking Hezbollah pushing drugs into America to make that happen 
t1_duxj7lt	0	*	What will happen is women will help to enforce that their female friends and family wear it.
t1_duxkf0x	1	*	Shitty country? Or shitty government?
t1_duxo3wy	1	*	i'd say that's an intentional loophole
t1_duy9g05	1	*	Pure bliss. 
t1_duyeqsf	0	*	More like trying to move their culture to what it was 50 years ago. Iran then had nothing to do with Iran now
t1_duxidz5	1	*	Yeah that wasn't how it went down
t1_duxrt4g	1	*	Ehh the Muslim majority and surrounding countries won't be revolutionized anytime soon it will probably be another 25 years before that happens
t1_duxm9kb	0	*	Its not a shithole. I've visited and its pretty nice mostly. Don't let this single issue create your impression of Iranians. They are good people, well educated and generally happy.
t1_duydtj6	1	*	Ali G style. I like it 
t1_duz377w	1	*	What bullshit.. Most feminists don't, but go for the low hanging fruit I gues..
t1_duxskiy	1	*	Your name is about murdering political dissenters. Dont try to lecture people on freedom.
t1_duxnct7	0	*	Do you realize that the regime and the 80 million population are separated?  As an Iranian I do.  As a stranger behind your screen you probably don't.
t1_duxyue4	0	*	American intervention is one of the big problems that started it, doubt anything else will be done.
t1_duxpth8	1	*	If my uncle read the words Iran use to be pretty liberal and progressive he would assume that meant they use to be like ISIS. 
t1_duxk25x	1	*	Yea right, if Trump could outlaw clothes he would. Easier to oogle.
t1_duz3vcq	1	*	In what countries isn't feminism needed according to you?
t1_duxopzp	0	*	Backwards... hijab was actually illegal during a part of the shah's reign before the revolution (may have been the shah's father, can't look it up right now), but since 1979 it has been mandatory. 
t1_duxlk49	0	*	Just gonna throw this out there. Lots of men are forced to marry against their will in these places too. 
t1_duxp1aw	1	*	Sure that. It is all about men. Women are property.
t1_duxs5sp	1	*	I feel like the middle ground here is giving them the choice to either wear it or not. That's supporting them by treating them as human beings with a right to choices.
t1_duy6pnd	0	*	Going by history most would be imprisoned. British imposed tax on salt and when people tried to break the 'law' thousands were imprisoned
t1_duxl8v0	1	*	Did it hurt you to streatch that far?
t1_duxxybf	1	*	Have you seen 1960s Iran? Perfect example of what Sharia Islam can do if it becomes majority and power. 
t1_duxpe8l	0	*	It's not a religious expression. This is emancipation from group think.
t1_duxhrr6	1	*	/s, for those of you who cant tell.
t1_duyev0q	1	*	Shah wasnt a novice with control of the state. The current establishment has strong ties in every layer of society, and rebellion is easy to get stopped.
t1_duxjebs	1	*	Oddly enough, I didn't see one pink pussy hat during national female mutilation awareness day last month.
t1_duxitjk	0	*	what ecactly did you think would happen ?  oh look this woman isnt obeying our stupid laws... guess we were wrong all along lets change and be happy.  
t1_duxhv3l	0	*	Saudi Arabia is starting to open up. Women can drive now and they have movies again. They'll catch up if they keep up their current trajectory, but as for the rest...
t1_duxj3fs	0	*	how does that even make sense? What the fuck are you yammering about?
t1_duxtkbw	0	*	God bless our 50% divorce rate!
t1_duxtchu	1	*	And here it is. Somehow, it's always the fault of the U.S.
t1_duxle4l	0	*	I wonder how they would cope if there were no women in their country left?
t1_duxe429	0	*	> Sad part is that Iran used to be very liberal and progressive.  But then an ayatollah who was exiled in Paris was allowed to come back.  
t1_duyu9w3	1	*	It is if youre being told NOT to wear it.   Doing what you want regardless of what others say is empowerment. 
t1_duxws1u	1	*	Because they don't want to be told whether or not to wear it. They want it to be their choice.
t1_duxm2uq	1	*	The thinking is with their faces uncovered they are tempting all the horny men that just cant controle themselves. 
t1_duxp9ry	1	*	Islam tends to do that
t1_duxmvm9	1	*	I do wish, though, that we'd be more willing to share more of this great country with people fleeing oppressive regimes like Iran's. 
t1_duy90ec	1	*	Because those women are doing what they're told. Fucking bastards.
t1_duxtc0e	1	*	Oh don't mind that. That's just the brainwashing of our young. Gotta get'em early ya know. 
t1_duxl994	1	*	So people shouldn't protest something because others have it worse?
t1_duxh7xz	0	*	Why would they crack down on that? Women dont have rights? 
t1_duxj3xe	1	*	Well you're talking about the vice president of the United States.
t1_duxi8ii	1	*	Women had very little to do with anything there. Iran seems reasonable at least from that perspective.
t1_duxk1o6	1	*	*shithole
t1_duxt7pe	1	*	Hell I hate him but it was true when he said it. We just don't wanna recognize shit hole countries so we don't have to think about them. 
t1_duxv5s3	1	*	Yeah, the stonings would probably go much quicker.
t1_duxkt1s	0	*	Didn't work out to well with the Bay of Pigs. Now imagine a larger scale. 
t1_duxx4os	1	*	It doesn't have to make sense.
t1_dtd2ke8	1	*	The issue isn't the blockchain it's the shit tier companies that have repeated trust issues
t1_dtd30th	0	*	There isnt 
t1_dtdexsg	1	*	Buy gold fuck the dollar?
t1_dtd2zw6	1	*	Yeah, exchanges
t1_dtd6wrx	1	*	They make more money on the trades than was taken in this hack. So setting up an exchange just to hack it and now be in possession of locked and useless currency sounds pointless.
t1_dsiz5co	1	*	We won't live to 2040-whatever so who cares? 
t1_dsx7tr8	1	*	/s
t1_dub667l	0	*	And lose a limb to an IED and become permanently disabled even!

t1_dt4bqqm	1	*	DUDE WEED LMAO
t1_dt5pmbc	1	*	Unless you have a culture strongly related to alcohol.  There is a reason people consider alcohol much less harmless than it really is. It is often part of the culture (especially CE/EE) to drink.
t1_dt4v2p8	1	*	Considering how many people in Russia die from alcohol related causes, it's probably truer there than anywhere else.
t1_dt5aad4	0	*	She.
t1_dt546fl	1	*	Maybe she's how Putin will stay in control after his next term ends.  Raises her profile in this election, then gets her elected as a puppet he can control for the rest of his life.
t1_dt4rq4q	1	*	She's Putin's soft underbelly...
t1_dt5ynf7	1	*	Well they aren't wrong.
t1_dt4g0bz	1	*	Nothing will happen to her. 
t1_dt5na79	1	*	Except this time, its a stooge created by Putin so that thered be an illusion of choice. 
t1_dt5pnh6	1	*	It is just smoke and mirrors. Woah, dude, a mirror.
t1_dshhldm	0	*	Fuck gay couples then?
t1_dtes05c	1	*	Up to means anywhere under. It would be accurate to say that *I* control up to 80% of all crypto currencies. You're spouting meaningless jibber jabber. 
t1_ds8abo8	1	*	Yah, screw apple because Intel chips have a vulnerability.  I hope you only use AMD cpus  in your PC - because all Intel chips since 1995 are vulnerable to this.
t1_ds4m65q	1	*	The hype train again. 
t1_dt0j1md	0	*	The article says 22 million

t1_dt1s23l	1	*	It is. Without it, the situation will be much worse.
t1_dudvort	1	*	Both the American and British government has been funding the YPG openly. It is in Turkey where they are deemed a terrorist organisation.

t1_dsj44mh	1	*	Kinda makes me wonder what would happen if a country got banned from the Olympics the same year they are the hosting it 
t1_dsiit4d	1	*	The world tends to turn a blind eye because Russian economy is in the complete shitter and the only thing it will fall back on is planetary nuclear holocaust if pushed against the wall.

t1_dshkyo9	1	*	Banning countries who repeatedly cheat seems like a smart move. 
t1_dsinm5t	1	*	That be would be ace.   Like watch a man sprint 100M in 3 seconds then immediately high jump over a 10M high wall.
t1_dsigzgz	1	*	You should address this to the Russian Goverment. It  is the problem, not russian people. Hey Russia sounds very rednecky. Just sayin.

t1_dtdaxcr	0	*	America thinks North Korea is THE major threat, the rest of the world not so much.
t1_dtdfby0	0	*	Not, really. Russia has its own coast on the Black Sea and thus Crimea does not really change anything for their access to the Mediterranean.

t1_dv0ve7h	1	*	American here. I can't think of a single person I know who works full time and works any less than 40 :(
t1_dv0kvb4	1	*	also even if you leave work,you still have to go social with your coworkers and drink beer with them.Japan also have this culture,so there's a lot drunk dudes in the streets of japan and korea
t1_dv0ay14	1	*	AnyoHaseyo!
t1_dv09iu2	0	*	The article does not say that.
t1_dv0yczk	1	*	Most Americans work no where near that. And frankly neither do you if you're not lying in the rest of your comment history.
t1_dv13m0x	1	*	Or your boss leaves his office lights on with his jacket over the chair... Brb...
t1_dv0v5l3	0	*	That's sad. You should find some hobbies.

t1_dv0dahp	1	*	>It is an advanced economy  Corporate oligarchy propped up by the West.  > with a functioning democracy.  HAHAHAHAHAHA  >There is no excuse for this, other than raw exploitation.   True.
t1_dv0lv1x	1	*	It is, if it is forced.  If you want to ruin your own life, go ahead. But let's not force others to be such idiots.
t1_dv0hpjx	1	*	Its not. It ranks top 5 for tech, r&d per capita. The imf says its an advanced economy 
t1_dv1xqtm	1	*	When South Koreans impeached Park, they got Moon. When Americans impeach Trump, they'll get Pence.
t1_dv0avag	1	*	Very very dumb.
t1_dv05fym	0	*	Its not. Its even counterproductive. People are tired, care less about what they do, etc. 
t1_dv0ojxe	1	*	maybe they meant developed world... then it would make sense
t1_dv1mi1r	1	*	You need to find yourself a better job 
t1_dv0fvga	0	*	It's the same in Japan. Their societies are so hight-tech and fairly advanced in many fields, how is it possible they are so backwards with this?! 
t1_dv1pal1	1	*	Similar in Japan, it's the main reason keeping me from going there to live, the work culture is insane, people fucking die
t1_dtdnpmq	1	*	Maybe they're insured by a dumb insurance company.
t1_dupcols	1	*	OG Metal 
t1_dup60vt	1	*	Kinda reminds me of plenty of black metal concerts I've been to.
t1_dupsawz	1	*	Senua's Sacrifice?
t1_duowcga	1	*	But it's not natural.
t1_dupbr7b	1	*	Exactly. Which is why they didn't have anything more than guns. Some nobody going to give these village bumpkins anything serious, besides AKs. Hope this sends a message to other aspiring adventures
t1_duq1p42	1	*	I think you mean to say yankee scum, budday
t1_duptlfb	1	*	Ive been hearing they had T-72s and other armor along with arty? Still got rinsed.
t1_dup7lra	1	*	There is no way they thought the Americans were there. 
t1_dup840w	1	*	> * Blatant admission that Russian mercenaries in Syria are fighting on behalf of Putin's government.  Soldiers crying about Russian government abandoning them proves this.
t1_dupdyzx	1	*	> Or horrible recon.   Shit's like the last season of Game of Thrones. Except that there is no plot armor.
t1_dupeu21	1	*	Still has a high accuracy rating on sites i checked. 
t1_dtr68cn	1	*	I think it was a good game, fun to watch. Not super into football but this was a close, clean game. Professionals on both sides, clearly.
t1_dtra7ry	1	*	Don't forget Wentz. Both of them deserve a lot of credit
t1_dtrlbiv	1	*	But they're *world champions* /s
t1_dtrbd1f	0	*	They ban anything remotely us politic related that is not anti trump,but somehow this is fine. Can't say I'm surprised in the slightest.
t1_dtr7up1	0	*	One thing I have to give the Pats credit for, they always keep their super bowls close. 
t1_dt5om5v	1	*	I would be willing to try my luck with the watered down Coke uncut from the depth of the ocean before the majority of the garbage you come across these days.
t1_dt4rjb4	1	*	Not if he has Canadian dollars. Those things will last forever 
t1_dt5wkul	1	*	Also did we even have 50 billions in cash back then? That seems like a... submarine... Worth of $100 bills.
t1_du3y80s	1	*	Youre right, and there are certainly plenty of Western propaganda organisations in social media.
t1_dt9k2to	0	*	He's an enigma. I have absolutely no idea why he keeps getting hired. All groups of all nationalities hate him and he has no talents or special knowledge.
t1_dt9ke06	1	*	No, he didnt. He said he would if asked to. 
t1_dsqkbne	1	*	By making it actually scarce. They arent keeping it. 
t1_dsqr4q0	1	*	You mean 1$ million worth? Already destroyed 53 million
t1_dsrep5d	1	*	Got to find some way of looking after the economy post-Brexit!
t1_dsrep6o	1	*	A message to whom? Why is there such a demand in the first place? These demonstrations do nothing. It's like a bandaid for a quadruple bypass surgery. 
t1_dtxii72	1	*	Um, Bush isnt on the left...
t1_dtxlqpa	0	*	W. is also the last person who should be complaining about election irregularities.
t1_dtxh18t	1	*	He doesn't need one. Probably never did.
t1_dtxjdg3	1	*	to be fair i think everyone else has announced that already so he is the last person to do so. 
t1_dtxglb9	0	*	In his defense there was oil!
t1_dt2x1qg	1	*	It's done through shifting of tectonic plates pretty much. I think it's just a natural occurrence without God's intervention. If or when he does earthquakes, we would know!
t1_dt2fdxf	1	*	Tide comes in, tide goes out... you can't explain that!
t1_duw565m	1	*	That sub is cancer lol
t1_duvoc7b	0	*	Yeah, brexit or trump
t1_duvzped	1	*	Hey, you figured out what the police couldnt! They must be stupid or something.
t1_dt2s6iq	0	*	Stop fucking saying that. 
t1_dt2wp3q	0	*	There are times when that quip makes sense. This isn't one of those times.
t1_dtck3fh	0	*	Truth in satire.
t1_du3t0xb	0	*	LOL poor baby can't play his video games :(
t1_du4f995	1	*	uBlock Origin, not uBlock.
t1_du4s3uk	1	*	Cancer gave me $22,000 from $1,500. 
t1_du4hzwi	0	*	did someone just say the word bubble?
t1_du3vny8	1	*	no u
t1_ds36jyz	1	*	Good observation. I am perfectly happy to let some other fools try it for a change.
t1_dtta8gd	1	*	It truly is, they have taken something so high tech and made it look so ordinary. Technology has come a long way.
t1_dsuqtca	0	*	> a trend that accelerated as President Donald Trump began to make good on campaign promises    But yeah, this is on all Americans who voted for Trump or didn't vote at all. 
t1_dsv2v0g	1	*	Sounds like you dont want to come over and smoke this bowl with me and help me play my video games or smoke my weed or eat pizza and listen to pond.  Fine.  I get that. But you're wrong
t1_dte4uav	1	*	Have you heard of those Caucasians? Same deal.
t1_ds7v1w5	0	*	Which is a bit of a simplification as 9/11 was done by Sunni Muslims. Rather than Shiites.  
t1_duhww94	1	*	His middle finger.
t1_duk4jk3	1	*	Because you don't do that with your citizens. That's a stupid move.
t1_duivexg	1	*	Sure, but we don't take orders from China.  Maybe if they reign in North Korea, and get them to dump their nuclear weapons program we can talk.  Otherwise, no dice.
t1_dui7ajw	0	*	There's a Chinese idiom called , which literally translates to killing the chicken in front of the monkeys as a warning, but would loosely translate to exemplary punishment.
t1_duhung2	0	*	Layover in N. Korea 
t1_dui3uaw	0	*	What the he'll do shapes and sizes have to do with any of this?
t1_duhq1x6	0	*	Yeah, hope he gets prison and a thumb up his ass
t1_dui2zn9	0	*	Exactly, 6 months in prison should do it.
t1_dui4ozk	0	*	It should be unusual enough that people notice that it is occurring, and cruel enough that people fear having it done to them.
t1_duiikuc	1	*	One, Two, Three, Four -China.
t1_duin3sx	1	*	Pretty sure they do that already, after that thing in Egypt.
t1_duhsed8	0	*	A string of incidents isn't really proof of anything for a country that is like 1/6th of the world population.
t1_duj9sfd	0	*	Have you ever been to a museum? Not everything is in a glass case. 
t1_dszmhb6	1	*	I hate crime, so absolutely.
t1_dteulav	1	*	Yeah, only a matter of time 
t1_dtg7jof	1	*	Wow, even fucking Brazil?!!  That's nuts.
t1_ds7zs18	0	*	Very true.   Honestly fuck trump, he puts everyone at risk over his own ego.   Sincerely - an Australian. 
t1_dsnpfg2	0	*	and click this on.nimp link for free money!
t1_dso1tie	0	*	Every article I have read about Kaspersky being compromised, talks about high levels of confidence, suspicions, etc. but I still haven't seen a single piece of real evidence being mentioned or linked.
t1_dsng9rr	0	*	The CIA and DARPA both have people involved in FB. In fact the same people with dreams of a database in which personal connections were easily tracked. 
t1_dso9758	1	*	Not only that, but NSA would have done exactly that if the tables were reversed. 
t1_dsngkeq	0	*	Found Lucius Fox's reddit account.

t1_dsobiri	1	*	They keep screaming about how they fucked with the election. That was your job to stop that shit you useless fucks. 
t1_dsnlm3c	1	*	All of silicon valley was DOD funded research up until the 80s and 90s. The whole thing grew out of WW2 radar research. 
t1_dsnhcan	1	*	It's still just rumors. The same rumors they've been pushing for a year now to smear Kaspersky. Anonymous sources? Come on. 
t1_dsod7l2	1	*	US companies are forced to comply, thats known for some time. Intel, Apple etc all are sharing data with the government, probably since decades
t1_dsnjili	0	*	Google was founded by two Russian dudes! /s
t1_dsntfja	1	*	Put it like this...  At the moment the only Anti-virus programme with a known track record of successfully detecting NSA malware is Kaspersky.
t1_dso3ghv	0	*	Bitdefender is pretty good. Also you should use add-ons in your browser like uBlock and No coin.
t1_dsnoy08	0	*	Russia employs hackers the us jails them
t1_dsodfxh	1	*	I think its something like 575 billion dollars a year and that's not all of it. Now that's jaw dropping.
t1_dso2lpi	1	*	Like I as a private person with no value to any intelligence agency whatsoever would double guess using Kaspersky. Should I be working at the NSA as a security advisor? Because it seems like I should.
t1_dtomn5m	1	*	Ill take that bet
t1_dtnvmbg	1	*	We ofc wouldn't call it bullshit if it was an U.S. citizen. 
t1_dtnn49l	1	*	https://youtu.be/Vlx6gQWfjp0
t1_dtnwfgo	1	*	Pitchforks are insufficient. 
t1_dto153l	1	*	Say what? 
t1_dsirfsd	1	*	> Was anyone held responsible for this crisis?   You just caused a roar of laughter among bankers.  > is anyone in prison?   And now they're rolling on the floor.
t1_dtcxizx	1	*	It has flashing lights every night lol
t1_du93swt	1	*	Youre right. Now is never the time to talk about gun control when it comes to America.
t1_du941zz	1	*	I guess that means that the shooter definitely wouldn't be looking like Trumps son?
t1_du94erq	0	*	Why is this world news then? If this was in Canada or the UK or Germany it would be insane news. But this is business as usual in America.
t1_du93uao	1	*	thank you, I forgot to add a comment about physical location
t1_dtu3e3m	1	*	> the Canadian obama  That sounds pretty good. 
t1_dso6ypd	1	*	I didn't even know about this controversy and I heard that as a sarcastic joke that fell flat. But after reading about the controversy... well there goes my theory.
t1_dto4re7	1	*	The soldiers were Indonesian.
t1_dttelfh	1	*	Interesting question. 
t1_duy5su8	1	*	You're only correct in that there will be deniers right up to the end, and they'll get much more obsessed and violent as things get worse.
t1_duy9orw	0	*	There are actually many island nations currently complaining about rising water levels destroying their islands.
t1_duy2d6z	1	*	The guy who discovered the problems with the ozone layer. He's as legit as it gets. U0001f633  He's basing it on Arctic sea ice predictions which aren't particularly controversial. 
t1_dsbzgu1	1	*	You are clearly missing a great deal of context (and common sense).
t1_dsbxyvb	0	*	My dad said he named me after the bible. All my names have 6 letters, makes me chuckle.
t1_dsbtdh5	1	*	Yeah, we only predict the end times based on hard facts from experts. Like the Mayans.
t1_dshag67	0	*	On the opposite side: EU countries won't extradite to the USA if the person could get the death sentence. 
t1_dsgxp18	1	*	Hmm. How about no. 
t1_dtm4gqj	1	*	That would be suicide on Cuba's part, that is if you're talking about them taking Guantanamo, I might've misunderstood 
t1_dt43oir	1	*	What percentage of jobs in the auto industry are in manufacturing?   Probably a similar percent. Losing the auto manufacturing sector would be devastating.
t1_dt3much	0	*	What welfare in particular?  Not denying there is any, just wondering what the main payments are that you'd like to see removed.
t1_dt3pqds	1	*	They don't need a loophole, a company can charge whatever it wants for products (they just might not sell if they are too expensive) so they can pass this cost onto consumers right now.
t1_dt3krpg	0	*	we don't make panels though.  that doesn't make sense.
t1_dt3o6ep	1	*	Not if companies start making and installing solar state side. 
t1_dt3mxoy	1	*	Sure, since you invented solar panels and washing machines...
t1_dt0h14b	1	*	Will?? You sweet summer child..
t1_dull3fz	1	*	If Chelsea Clinton did this now, while her mother isn't president TD would be yelling about it. 
t1_dsc06di	1	*	Dibs on page 3 after you're done with it.
t1_dsbxomy	1	*	They are Tories, they would happily reinstitute laws from the 19th century if they could get away with it.
t1_dsbrves	1	*	Just use tor it's all good
t1_dsc0nqd	1	*	They ain't liberal, just cunts. 
t1_dsbxtk6	1	*	Found the fascist.  Btw fascism is extremely anti-pornography, liberalism is all about political rights, and feminism is pro-normalisation of sexual relations.
t1_dsbnrqx	0	*	Looking at porn gives you an idea of how the world works? Wow. 
t1_dsbzb81	1	*	Or when the Government responds to criticism with bullets.
t1_ds6feje	1	*	Who doesnt?
t1_dtic7j7	0	*	We'll all get lifted!
t1_dtistd4	0	*	Because drugs are the devil and it makes the baby jesus cry if you use drugs.
t1_dtigy53	1	*	Making drugs illegal is as much regulating as cutting off a limb is a cure for cancer. Regulation is what people want for other drugs, as we do for alcohol and tobacco.
t1_dtito2f	1	*	What about keeping ethanol legal? It kills thousands of people, even those that don't ingest it!
t1_dtbjq4i	1	*	Key U.S ally above all

t1_duiz5cs	0	*	What the fuck is wrong with this comment? 
t1_duij787	1	*	Refugee plants.
t1_duijevd	1	*	It was rigged since the beginning 
t1_duii603	1	*	What so he can fuck everything in sight until he finds a solution that involves Head & Shoulders???
t1_dtaf8nl	0	*	? What's Boeing got to do with the F-35?
t1_dtzt9sz	1	*	Let's hope it stays that way. No good ever comes from more factions being involved in the middle east. 
t1_dt627b0	0	*	Whoa.. calm down there Ranjeet Rambo Vindaloo.. :D
t1_duso2yb	1	*	Jo.
t1_duby3g1	0	*	yes but this article is talking about sketchy at home DIY 'transplants'  not legit ones.

t1_ds13y31	1	*	He seems out of sorts but is actually playing the same game as Trump-et man. ....and yes they both really are out of touch.
t1_ds13tia	1	*	Nice try Kim... Release the nukes!
t1_ds17e3a	1	*	Yves St Poverty
t1_ds13wiz	1	*	i hope this is their only reason
t1_ds12hnw	1	*	To be fair, he is batshit crazy.  He could announce two days from now another complete 180 reversal and be threatening the US again.
t1_ds16amx	1	*	It's not much different to the US and SK doing joint-military exercises every year.
t1_ds1b49c	0	*	Well considering NK thinks everything is an aggression, his statement means nothing.
t1_ds1322o	1	*	>this is a reason to be optimistic  almost everything is aggression in kim's eyes
t1_ds1gajz	1	*	They're actually very much alike.  Unhinged sociopaths with brainwashed minions who worship them as gods, flaunting their nuclear weapons.  
t1_ds15o7o	1	*	this is an utterly naive sentiment, but enjoy the karma
t1_ds162cf	1	*	Beat me to it!! :D so good! 
t1_ds198gp	1	*	I still dont like the odds. Do we just lease North Korea alone, and let them advance forward? I dont want to see them actually become well off knowing what kind of government they are.
t1_ds1a4wd	1	*	Every girl's crazy 'bout the sharp dressed man
t1_ds19u65	1	*	Hehehe
t1_ds14ls4	0	*	arent you too busy ignoring starving 8 million in yemen while caring more about cat videos too lecture others?
t1_ds14gxg	1	*	This sort of analysis is pointless in the context of Kim jung un.  His words are a facade and do not convey any meaning beyond manipulation of the gullible.  
t1_ds149ku	0	*	I laughed too hard at this.
t1_ds14nhl	0	*	Same as in American: T-R-U-M-P
t1_ds13njt	1	*	If we go off of things world leaders are saying, we have more to fear from the US.
t1_ds1jm2e	1	*	The problem is that they take everything as aggression
t1_ds0veve	1	*	Glad to see someone else gets it
t1_ds14lna	1	*	HA!   Thank you so much, this post made me feel so much better after spending a lot of time explaining basic stuff to redditors in this thread. 
t1_ds0vpoc	0	*	Someone told him the U.S. is bigger than it looks on a map
t1_ds1dq3b	1	*	I have a diplomatic solution. Potato swap. We will give them potatoes in exchange for missiles. Seems like a win win.
t1_ds14ovp	1	*	As long as theres no aggression against us...U0001f602U0001f923 Uve been slammed sanction after sanction and after sanction, idiot. U0001f602
t1_ds22woz	1	*	>oil supply was blockaded   In response to the Imperial Japanese invasion of Manchuria.
t1_ds13oz6	1	*	Nuclear weapons are one of the best things to happen to us because of MAD, right up until nuclear weapons are one of the worst things to happen to us because of MAD.   
t1_ds163jo	0	*	Well the US does military exercises right off their shore so launching a single missile miles away from Japan is nothing.
t1_ds1b14c	1	*	Fuck.
t1_ds1drnz	1	*	What a gullible fool you are.
t1_ds151ro	1	*	Cool, so no more tons of rice. 
t1_ds1uuvq	1	*	> New year new me - Kim Jong Un   -Michael Scott  
t1_ds13gdc	1	*	Nah, they've always said their nukes are for retaliation. They also say mean words constitute an attack
t1_ds17zvf	1	*	Same same but different
t1_ds142mn	1	*	Considering every major news network is running this statement, very.
t1_ds1evhc	1	*	The whole modern day slavery thing they have going on is all that's stopping us from doing that.
t1_ds1qou1	0	*	Realpolitik question, isn't their close ties with China sufficient deterrence to US intervention?
t1_ds1cnaa	0	*	No youre not
t1_ds15pp4	1	*	ah finally. I'm kinda satisfied it took me this long in the comments, but here we arrive to the fools who don't understand game theory.
t1_ds133fg	1	*	He's a complete scumbag, but all of his statements about using nukes have been in the context of US military threats on the Korean Peninsula including annual war games simulating war against NK.
t1_ds14mhs	0	*	> he's broken deals after receiving overseas aid  actually if you look up the actual facts the only one that broke any deals was the U.S the short time they tried diplomacy.
t1_ds147qa	1	*	Damn.. This Kim guy looks so unhealthy. Like he's gon die of some blocked artery or so. 
t1_ds1yz53	1	*	Kim-Jong Un: What are you talking about, Officer? It's the truth! I only bark.

t1_ds12x8s	1	*	The dudes been supplied by both China and Russia. He doesn't have to threat anymore. He's the pet project of two of the world's largest powers.
t1_ds2msdb	1	*	What?
t1_ds1cpld	0	*	Obama was the first and only president to be at war every day of his tenure in office. Dont pick the party you vote against to blame, its the fault of both parties. 
t1_ds1d0r8	1	*	I'm sure Kim isn't hungry, it's the regular people in the country who are!

t1_ds19l9c	1	*	Hold my gold club... - Donald Trump
t1_ds1dqxp	1	*	Or now that he has a functional icbm deterrent, he does t need to grandstand.
t1_ds1dkzi	0	*	Well that isnt very nice
t1_ds160ts	1	*	But he left out the part where he considers every mean tweet and standard military exercise aggression against us.
t1_ds14qys	1	*	They dont actually have a nuclear program, they just bought a few items from Pakistan and then made it look like they were building them themselves. 
t1_ds163av	1	*	He still has gout though, also crippling addiction to Swiss cheese and wine.
t1_ds166ij	0	*	No. He is a Tyrant and is murdering people trying to flee his country. Welcome back to reality.
t1_ds14pjv	1	*	He just bought all that stuff to make it look like NK has an actual nuclear program. Now hes used it all up, so hes proclaiming the nuclear program is completed, and hes ready to negotiate. 
t1_dst238s	1	*	Heres a [CNN verification](http://edition.cnn.com/2018/01/16/health/montreal-cognitive-assessment-mental-health-trump/index.html) for evidence.

t1_dv2nkbo	1	*	It will affect real estate a lot less than other industries as there's little importation in the Real Estate business, but still colossally stupid

t1_dv2pnbc	1	*	The world is ending...  Looks around....well ... maybe not...guess we can see how this pans out.
t1_dv2ptr0	1	*	I'm really hoping the rest of the world will understand that we fucked up and when he's gone they will just go back to the way things were before we had the orange orangutan in office.
t1_dv2n0uf	0	*	So glad we have random shitwads on reddit so we don't have to rely on expert economists to explain complex geopolitical situations to us.
t1_dv2o4f2	1	*	No CB best CB
t1_dv2s8ew	0	*	I dont like him, but the economy is doing better than it has in a very long time. Were in the second biggest bull market in US history 
t1_dv2o9dn	1	*	Berlusconi was pretty dangerous but I agree otherwise.
t1_dv2sfcc	1	*	We are? Like libertarians are vehemently pro-free trade. 
t1_dv2rhsj	0	*	Dear China,        Want some lumber? Let's talk trade. We need to build a 4000 kilometer wall ASAP, and we hear you guys know how to do that.     Your Buddy,   Canada.   
t1_dv2pnl8	0	*	Seriously, they need to step up this investigation pronto and find something that will stick ASAP
t1_dv2qsiq	1	*	Not for NO reason. He's doing his job as a Russian agent. He's literally waging war against the US and her allies from the highest seat of US government.
t1_dv2ea6h	1	*	Doesn't seem like they need to, looks like he's doing a pretty good job of that all on his own
t1_dv2suff	1	*	Dumbest civilization in American history 
t1_dv2npqn	0	*	Real Estate Agent?  He even sucked at that game.  He's a glorified money launderer for the Russian mob.

t1_dv2snjy	1	*	Distraction.

t1_dv2ix9l	0	*	Trade wars are amazing, get huge incomes, then you can afford mercenaries which replenish way faster then my dying local men.
t1_dv2slxn	1	*	Everyone knows that Russia is a long time ally and supporter of the US.  Hey, where do I get my money? Oh, don't type that part? Shit.
t1_dv2of6m	1	*	Yeah well Canada has a drama teacher so what are ya gonna do?
t1_dv2udwx	0	*	For what exactly?
t1_dv2srnn	1	*	If it goes through it will force European steel to impose tariffs on China. 
t1_dv2npzp	1	*	Does the president have the authority to impose tariffs and start a trade war by himself?  Does Congress have any say in this?  
t1_dv2rf1j	1	*	The tarriffs Trump introduced are completely fucking stupid. 
t1_dv2ssyv	1	*	I dont have words for how stupid and ignorant he is.  He literally has no idea about the damage he does.  And Republicans elected this clown.
t1_dv2if5o	0	*	Walls? 
t1_dv2n5tl	1	*	Sigh.. yep, that's our fearless leader. I'm going to get a stiff drink....
t1_dv2t1lw	1	*	He is a rich and cringey version of Jim Jones
t1_dv2shfe	1	*	Its not for no reason, he is doing it because Putin told him so. The reason is just antithetical to everything the US stands for and its prosperity. 
t1_dv2q95x	1	*	These are all stories with one-sided opinions and not balanced at all?
t1_dv2r8p6	1	*	Imagine a bot helping you form an opinion? Its almost like its 1984. Where were the bots when the market was hitting all time highs? Interesting.
t1_dv2q06s	1	*	You act like we had a choice. He didnt win the popular vote, just a broken system. 
t1_dv2vqmd	1	*	So is foxnews not reporting on this at all? Surprised not to see it on the list
t1_dv2nxpq	1	*	Yes, But once we are all alone then America will be First in everything!
t1_dv2r68t	1	*	http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2018/03/02/trump-declares-trade-wars-are-good-digs-in-amid-tariff-turmoil.html  Even fox isn't spinning this into a positive, wow.
t1_dv2tnnr	1	*	For no reason?  If you look at it as him indeed being in Russia's pocket, it makes perfect sense.  What he does fits their agenda to a T.
t1_dv2mgti	1	*	Tell that to Condi Rice.
t1_dv2stfq	1	*	They didn't retract it. They paused it to see what shakes out of this. Totally prudent. 
t1_dv2pxll	1	*	I bet Kushner knew.

t1_dv2luka	1	*	The reason is Russia wanted him to do it
t1_dv2rj8r	0	*	I would applaud a full military coup if that's what it takes...

t1_dv2p0z9	0	*	>allies  While participating in trade wars against the US is an ally? I'm assuming you have a lot of friends that routinely steal from you right?
t1_dv2lsuh	1	*	There is a reason. Putin has grabbed Trump by the pussy, and Trump just lets him because Putin is a star. 
t1_dv2nsw4	1	*	Why do you think they aren't? 
t1_dv2ir0x	1	*	Well, in that case. The chinese government is subsidizing your steel with chinese taxpayers, relax and enjoy.
t1_dv2rt2h	1	*	Oh ya, what a really unpopular opinion on Reddit.  
t1_dv2pvrh	1	*	Check out r/libertarian  I don't usually visit worldnews because the stupidity in the comments is overwhelming. 
t1_dv2k3os	1	*	> Trade wars are pointless  It was a great game though!
t1_dv2ndye	1	*	Where are those crazy guys with 3 names when you need them?
t1_dv2sujl	1	*	trashing the US economy and relations is exactly what Putin wants
t1_dv2ns8q	1	*	Honestly it sucks. But as a Canadian theres a small silver lining as we realize how much our trade and culture needs to divest from America. 
t1_dv2oz2x	1	*	imagine you are in his positiion and your only goal is further your own relations and make money, what would you do? yeah... probably exactly what he is doing now
t1_dv2tvmw	1	*	He's systematically dismantling the US for Putin. Russia is winning.
t1_dv2n41g	1	*	What would I do if I were a Russian Manchurian candidate?
t1_dv2rgmh	1	*	Nobody wins.
t1_dv2ryft	1	*	>The world has been ~~waiting for an excuse to ignore Americas influence.~~ putting off paying for it's own military.
t1_due2dqr	1	*	Unfortunately that book basically ignored all the research that has been going on in Mosquitia for decades prior. Their find isn't nearly as unique as they made it out to be.
t1_dudn3cz	1	*	If you were born in Michoacxe1n, YOU ARE with 100% certainty Purxe9pecha.
t1_dudscgj	0	*	Obviously its not still standing......
t1_dudkqh2	0	*	What are the best history books on these civilizations?
t1_dudl5m5	1	*	Yeah, it served the best ~~mexican~~ aztec food.
t1_duelgs4	1	*	The buildings were obviously much smaller, right? No skyscrapers in Precolumbian America. The allusion to Manhattan is an audience puller, but not very good at drawing a realistic idea of the city. 
t1_dudodli	1	*	Dude same, I'm from a small town named Huipana in northern michoacan. The name translates directly to cave of wolves in the native language
t1_dudn9xx	0	*	Whoa, calm down, bud. 
t1_dudkl7m	1	*	No, this is actually a seperate LIDAR finding in western mexico; it's not the Maya one. 
t1_dudt39b	0	*	I use lidar in my job as a flooding and water engineer. We all hate it. All it does is crash our PCs and waste our time.
t1_dudrn02	1	*	This was my first thought, it'll be interesting to see what he makes of it. 
t1_dudpr1b	1	*	Wouldn't be surprised, that was an amazing book
t1_duf56os	1	*	A metric fuck tonne.
t1_dufg52p	1	*	Laser operating on an aerial vehicle would perhaps be more accurate. 
t1_duf75m8	1	*	This was in western Mexico, so the climate is way more comparable, to say, something like Arizona then tropical jungles.   The vast majority of it is probably buried underground. 
t1_dudo0wa	0	*	They conquered it, but they found more glory in not admitting to genocide and saying that they discovered it
t1_dt79hc3	1	*	And be dirt poor again. Who could pass that up?
t1_dt7ki7c	1	*	it's not completely insane, if the unify as a nuclear it pushes the Americans away and makes anyone think twice about invading the fragile post unification state..
t1_dt72gt4	1	*	Ceylons at Caprica.  That was rough, but we survived by fleeing into space.
t1_dt7cs32	0	*	Why should he? He has been elected democratically. Can't say the same about the puppet regime in the American occupation zone.
t1_dt6xjut	0	*	North Korea has called for unification for decades; this isn't progress.
t1_dt79emz	1	*	If South Korea rejects, it would not at all look like they are the bad guys. It is pretty clear who the bad guys are.
t1_dt71gz1	0	*	It's like Unification in Star Trek TNG where the Romulans were planning to invade Vulcan through a fake unification
t1_dt7kiky	0	*	How does china stop it if unified Korea has nukes?
t1_dv4sf5z	1	*	top-right - targets anus area  bottom-left - targets vulva; if you have the other set of genitals, the water jet will probably hit somewhere behind and under your scrotum
t1_dv4pa59	0	*	What do you like about it?
t1_dtuhze3	1	*	what? thats not true. this applies to hard drugs if all but not to weed... you have any source or proof for this?
t1_dtugr37	1	*	Maybe around 80 years too late. Imagine what could have been.  Hey, Poland! You have a really cool country! You want to come over and listen to some of this Jazz music that is totally not verboten?
t1_dtv8q7o	0	*	Actually, is there *any* other country besides the US that allows asset forfeiture seizures? I'm curious....
t1_dtuguy9	1	*	That would require it to be the position of the actual police itself and of the people who can realistically influence decisions of this magnitude.
t1_dtujn00	1	*	This is what happened in Boulder, CO. Juries wouldnt convict possession charges, so cops stopped issuing citations.  They would confiscate your pipe and weed, though.
t1_dtuj4gn	1	*	Beautiful poem.
t1_dtudf37	0	*	What will you do to change that? 
t1_dtucluz	1	*	The sketchy bit was criminalization. 
t1_dtu07so	1	*	It's long overdue for a loooot of drugs (if not all). But ultimately decriminalization is not enough, full legalization is the way to go. Good start though.
t1_dtucuzi	0	*	As an American who can legally buy weed from a store on my way home from work I guess I didn't realize I was living in the future.
t1_dtulgo6	1	*	Versteht jemand den

t1_dtukxso	0	*	Meh, decriminalisation is all fine and well, but it's also always kind of half-assed. There should be plan for proper legalisation, but I don't see a way to get that past the conservatives. 
t1_dtudtga	0	*	The was my first thought too. Didn't expect the comment this high up...
t1_dtuecr0	1	*	Not with the current admin, Jeff Sessions thinks all pot smokers are evil people so very unlikely. Not even clear if they will continue to respect states rights.  
t1_dtukdvh	0	*	Actually the number of imprisoned has decreased steadily by 18,000 over the past 14 years.
t1_dtucipp	0	*	Shit I'm already surrounded by legal states it won't be but another decade. Utah will take like 20 years though

t1_dsip922	1	*	Nice try, India!
t1_dsivqzs	1	*	Pakistan wasn't a 5 Star country anyways.
t1_dsiodl8	1	*	And millions may be saved later. You don't get to hide behind the moral shield a child would use among grownups.
t1_dsio4qy	0	*	Maybe one day... friendship with US restored
t1_dsilhrq	0	*	Yeah, it was a doomed effort to begin with. If the US had realized how awful Pakistan was at the start then leaders here would not have tried to rely on them for anything.
t1_dsj8433	1	*	India would cheer the US on.    The US and India have been doing the Malabar naval exercises every summer, and have had increasing military ties with increasing trade ties.
t1_dsitxrr	1	*	I was foolish to think I would be able to come here and post this. There it is, top comment.
t1_dsj8sm0	1	*	Friends close, enemies closer.
t1_dsix76e	1	*	So is the US
t1_dsj643d	1	*	Yea but that's because of the ICE raids earlier this week not because of this.
t1_dsini5g	1	*	A solid analysis, probably the most solid I've seen in this thread.

t1_dsisupc	1	*	China has been their best friend for decades...
t1_dsihpoo	1	*	I don't remember ever Pakistan calling for the 'US Navy' after having a natural disaster. I remember getting worldwide financial aid for the earthquake and our own military helping out people.
t1_dsjd2ma	1	*	If they were just taking out money and doing whatever the fuck they wanted did we really have any influence to begin with?
t1_dsj8oef	1	*	fuck india, bunch of hyper-nationalist who play on western Islamophobia.  we can deal with everyone and be friends with no one
t1_dv552i6	1	*	Have you been smoking weed?  You have havent you?
t1_dv5kwuw	0	*	This is one stupid ass comment. If this tariff affects China, then all of the places you've named will be affected as well. 
t1_dv62rc9	1	*	Because America alone is what they want these people are isolationists

t1_dv5x1oc	0	*	Not China alone The EU too.
t1_dv5zvc0	0	*	> Americans can't even directly choose the president  That's not a requirement of democracy. That's just one type of voting system. Pick up a dictionary.
t1_dv5ij46	1	*	Chinese steel is only responsible for like 3% of imported steel in the US.   It's fascinating how loudly people speak when they don't understand anything.
t1_dv56fzx	1	*	What in no correlation 
t1_dv5dz4h	1	*	Last time we put steel tarrifs 200k people lost their job. 
t1_dv5hxsb	1	*	Thats what they want.
t1_dv5snta	0	*	China has to back up it's anti-protectionist rhetoric with action though. And right now even with Trump, China is way more protectionist than the US.
t1_dv5yezj	1	*	One thing is what his supporters think, another is the other Republicans. Am I mistaken when I thought they were in favour of free trade?
t1_dtv8qq5	1	*	The crime of the century. Up there with the Great Train Robbery. Assange must be pursued to the end of the earth!

t1_du0qw9k	1	*	Tbh, this is just publicity for a b-grade celebrity (finger quotations included in body language) and a failure of a tv show.
t1_du0yz4j	1	*	It would deter me from openly being straight.  
t1_du0zt0b	1	*	No, he's just on the wrong side of borderline retarded.
t1_du0slfm	1	*	Yep Mundine has a heel personality. He says all manner of retarded things and everyone loves seeing him get punched in the face.
t1_dthnil2	1	*	Yeah... I don't think people throwing tomatoes qualify as rioters.  A more accurate term would be highly-engaged critics.
t1_duw8jkt	1	*	You should learn and not fear monger.  Stratospheric warming events happen constantly.  This has nothin to do with anything other then a split of the polar vortex.
t1_duw2a4k	1	*	Some people say it's record breaking.
t1_duwelwr	1	*	I don't mean to be a dick but it doesn't make sense to use the word existentialism that way. Existential crisis? The feeling of being responsible? Or death anxiety, perhaps?

t1_duw4gon	1	*	As someone who lives in the arctic.  Im really ok with the warmer weather

t1_duw6cfz	1	*	Yup. This is basically the result of global warming. Ice age in Europe is the long term result, which everyone seems to forget.

t1_dt2q786	1	*	You're right it's almost impossible to have 100% of people to agree on anything. A poll conducted for a Atheist organizations that won't reveal their methodology is even more highly suspect.

t1_dsd9mt6	1	*	That is a very lame excuse. I suggest to address the problem with chemical castration of all the parliament staff.

t1_dsdcj4m	1	*	Yeah, I've seen nudes and worse at work when I'm doing 'desk based research'. Generally on Chinese sites - which has confused me because I thought the Chinese had a real ban on these sort of things. 
t1_dsdbxe7	1	*	What's a blue waffle?
t1_dsd7pv3	1	*	>lovely blue waffles  Ah, the worst thing to Google

t1_dsdcla5	1	*	Wow... total BS...
t1_dsd9jle	1	*	The staffers? I'm pretty sure they just want to get through the day. 
t1_dsd2sgb	0	*	Definitely a correlation between increased stress and porn visits.
t1_dsd3x1d	1	*	Clearly their employer does, personally the idea of watching porn at work/on an employers network seems rather odd to say the least. 
t1_dsd9195	1	*	Or when I'm browsing reddit and click someone's random link...
t1_dsd3kcj	1	*	Every time my young son visits his favourite football club's website, there's many 'attempts' at gambling.

t1_dx9d2tb	1	*	Here it is, April 12. What's the water situation like?
t1_duo2g9k	1	*	You are correct. The movement has completely died down. To begin with, the khalistanis were very few in number. Trudeau is empowering the old terrorists, unwittingly, for votes.
t1_dtkvq6f	0	*	Check your math. If the majority don't care, and a minority want it changed, it's not undemocratic to change it.
t1_dtkvhoy	1	*	Why do you care that they changed it?

t1_dstapcv	1	*	Don't forget the US of A! 
t1_ds63ohy	0	*	Pretty sure the government controlled media has already spun it as either a foreign attack, or foreign sabotage.  Help will be seen as an attack from the enemy

t1_duc152p	0	*	Previous instructions indicated that all enemy combatants should be shot in the dick.  Forces didn't know how to respond when presented with a dickless enemy.  This is a corrective measure.
t1_dsaqd27	1	*	Perspective is everything.

t1_dsb9n3j	1	*	People who don't have the ability to believe are harder to control. People that believe something that doesn't benefit the power structure are harder to control.   
t1_dsanilp	0	*	Are you american? Some countries kinda do need a revolution. Though no one needs the chaos it brings.
t1_dsb9dp5	1	*	That is equally as dogmatic and dangerous of an idea as criminalizing atheism. How about criminalise doing bad things to people on the basis of differing beliefs?
t1_dsbbmh1	0	*	Yeah, I really wanna see those big Triangles though.

t1_dsayk94	0	*	It's more a political ploy. Egypt is growing increasingly corrupt and eroding all that was once good. Soon they'll start charging political targets with this and fabricating evidence against them. 
t1_dtts4sz	1	*	So the pontiff is presumed to be correct about everything by default until it's definitively proven otherwise? That's a pretty nice set up.
t1_dsiv6bk	1	*	The article said he tried to steal wine though
t1_dta07ia	0	*	I know its not in the same league of tyranny but look at the Conservatives who have tried to revive McCarthys reputation. Heck, Oliver North has his own show on Fox. Revisionism ftw.

t1_dtrhx2n	1	*	Usually the kid has no choice in the matter lol. Another thing to remember is that most of the immigrants are the best from where thy came from. They are the ones that were able to make the move.   
t1_dtr4r87	1	*	first generation kids are canadians. They are born here and are raised here.  Why would they be any different than other canadians on the nice scale?
t1_dtqemxj	1	*	Don't forget they fail to report international earnings to pay proper taxes. Richmond, where the poor on welfare live in mansions.

t1_dsv2khp	0	*	Is the temporary foreign worker program not legal?
t1_dsua6n5	1	*	But that could cost corporate 2-5% of their profit margin! COMMUNIST!!!  /s
t1_dstx2kl	1	*	Theres plenty of Canadian workers available to take those jobs 
t1_dsgvwka	0	*	Just being accused is very powerful, so yes, that's scary. It's such a tough situation. What's due process in this context? It's sort of good to not be a man in power in this environment.
t1_dt2w793	1	*	They should be sent to prison on a fucking island. 
t1_dug77tj	0	*	There were deaths in 2017.
t1_dug2r1g	0	*	You mean like requiring people to pass training and show they're safely able to fly a plane before piloting one? What a good idea.
t1_dug4ivw	1	*	After Trump took credit for the 2017 aviation record, what are the chances he apologizes for these crashes?
t1_dufr5p7	1	*	So sad. So heartbreakingU0001f614
t1_dufr2l1	1	*	If its a Boeing or Airbus, I wouldnt be worried. These last two accidents have been an Antonov and an ancient ATR turboprop.
t1_dufxzt5	1	*	It's French.
t1_dufmoob	1	*	just hope that you fly on an airplane from this century
t1_dufujns	0	*	Why are they banned? i get that they aren't professional but i wanna know the official reason.
t1_dufo4nx	0	*	Meh, their standards are as low as most places. Football results, Olympic medals, Royal baby, all apparently worthy of a notification. 
t1_dug0b2l	1	*	We need to ban planes. We are the only planet that this regularly happens on. When will we realize? 
t1_dug0qzb	1	*	Youd be surprised.
t1_dug00qm	1	*	So, can we blame trump for this since he took credit for global disaster free 2017?
t1_dufsj1f	1	*	No one gives a fuck about you
t1_dufo4qy	1	*	Wow, what's wrong with you?
t1_dufr1l2	0	*	Airplanes don't kill people. Gravity kills people.
t1_dufuf74	1	*	Yeah and Im boarding a plane right now so this doesnt make me feel good at all 
t1_dug9bty	1	*	Pretty sure they are no longer banned from purchasing from Boeing. In fact this particular airline, Aseman Airlines, has 30 Boeing 737s on order. 
t1_dufsvee	1	*	The ATR is a very reliable piece of engineering that is flown all around the world. It is not a relic.
t1_dufwi0g	1	*	Passenger planes dont crash everyday, in 2017 there was fewer than 10, all of which were publicised like this one has

t1_dufyge3	1	*	Considering the circumstance I can only hope it was quick and without fear.  
t1_dugwqz3	1	*	No, it's the USA
t1_dufytpp	1	*	I think flying is still safer than driving and going to a school in the US 
t1_dufql8c	1	*	Bad weather never causes crashes.  Pilot errors or poor training cause crashes unfortunately.
t1_dufjjmx	1	*	Uh, no... that's not how time works. 
t1_dufqws2	0	*	Wherever such a loss of lives happens, it is heartbreaking. My heartfelt condolences to all the victims' families. 
t1_dufyb6t	1	*	Just remember, instant death is better than slower deaths like... inhaling soot and jet fuel fumes, and also better than a slow burn.
t1_duggsul	1	*	Fly stupid planes, win stupid prizes. 
t1_duhdktr	1	*	This is when survivors start eating each other right?
t1_dug741y	1	*	There were 2 big plane crashes in 2017, just none of them we're passenger 
t1_dufqsoq	1	*	An airplane can be old and still work just like new. Many militaries still use airframes from the 60-70s.   The only problem that arises is that yoy need more maintenance intervals.
t1_dug3rp4	1	*	Yeah you are looking at this from a media perspective. A lot more goes on there than you know about. Just go to r/watchpeopledie
t1_du5mz4o	0	*	which suits Putin just fine...
t1_du610g5	1	*	I have also seen them do that with stories about Canada (frequently) and Mexico. 
t1_dsoycev	1	*	Quite the opposite. He is courting old Communists. At the same time, those are relatively accurate observations.
t1_du52xx5	1	*	This wasn't voted on, it was a court decision

t1_du5vl3e	0	*	> 10 years from now it will only be spam.   Nah. Already is.
t1_du5uvhr	0	*	Not sure why that would be a good thing for anyone. You realise the EU is an absolutely massive market? They would be crippling themselves.
t1_du6rp6j	0	*	> You wouldn't belieVe what they capture then share   Please enlighten us. LinkedIn has millions of users, myself included, who would love to know what kind of data they collect and share.

t1_du5fowi	1	*	Data is currency now. There's just no way.
t1_du5lm7l	1	*	God damn, the shit they used to pull about 5 years ago too. There's consistently open up people's profiles to public, just so data sniffers could get things. Fuck you, Fb, your time is up.
t1_du5zmth	1	*	Germans are really serious about privacy. My old company couldnt even transfer personal data abroad.
t1_du5hjg4	1	*	They will when GDPR allows them to fine Facebook for 4% of their global revenue....
t1_du69eir	1	*	As a more mature company who's gone through this before, Google does a lot to comply with European regulations.
t1_du59pep	1	*	Don't know what socialism is, that much is clear.

t1_du5g9t7	0	*	What? That seems like a very strange concept.
t1_du5d0ab	1	*	Yes - theres an option to straight up delete your profile.  Make sure you unlink any apps that are linked to your FB.
t1_du5i6vx	1	*	I really don't care. Not what you're saying (I agree with you). I mean I really don't care and see why people care so much about these things.

t1_dt11t5v	1	*	Alcohol is prohibited by law so anyone (Muslim or non-Muslim) who sells alcohol would be punished.
t1_dt15jtb	1	*	I know right? Somehow it is a good thing...
t1_dt0m7qx	1	*	That's a fair point. But they are also different ways of pointing out Sharia Law, especially hardline adherence, has no place in a civilized society 
t1_dt0v0hm	1	*	I guess, but we've been bombing the custard out of Muslim countries for almost 30 years so I don't think anyone's worried about image.
t1_ds9onsg	1	*	Israeli bots downvote news on Israel to keep it out of the limelight.

t1_dtbmm2a	1	*	They'll have a regular boner too if they got past the Sun's first page.

t1_dtk61sf	1	*	It is thanks to trump 
t1_dsah7qo	0	*	My guess is Navalny would be much more active and aggressive in calling Putin out for corruption and bad policy.  Might even do something crazy like demand a live debate.

t1_dunrrge	0	*	And an opinion when white people get shot. Everyone is surprisingly silent on the issue until some white people get shot, THEN its suddenly a problem. 
t1_dup5ww9	0	*	Well, it works in Canada and Australia. The populations are widely distributed and fairly non-homogeneous in both those countries too, with a similar culture to the U.S. 
t1_dunr55n	1	*	the fact that meetings are taking place, which haven't before (IIRC) is a step, its progress, but more does need to be done.

t1_duopthd	1	*	Yes, surely people willing to ignore the consequences of murdering multiple innocents at one time will be fearful of the consequences of illegal-purchase and possession laws. Because that computes.
t1_duobgwo	0	*	Its not normal but it is acceptable given the alternative.  If you want to protect your children, protect them.
t1_duo6dxp	0	*	i think armed protection for students makes sense. maybe not from the teachers themselves, but campuses have police on them and no one seems to bat an eye. why not high schools and elementary schools?

t1_duotu7l	0	*	You're comparing number killed and not normalizing to number of police and number of mass killers.  Abysmally bad reasoning.
t1_duphs8q	1	*	> constitutional experts.  Why not biblical scholars? If you are ONLY guided by centuries old texts, then why the fuck do they need amendments?
t1_duovc8y	1	*	There was a saying in the old west. God created man, Colonel Colt made them equal.    Guns just balance things out between young, old, strong and weak, male and female.
t1_duofty3	1	*	CCW holders are the most law abiding demographic there is in the US. Moreso than police officers.
t1_duounjr	1	*	Just like Obama during brexit. 
t1_duoeoxl	0	*	Why is your view on law enforcement so ass backward? Dont break the law, dont get shot.

t1_dtikqez	1	*	Obama tried over and over to close it. No one would let him move the prisoners to prisons in the US.
t1_dtix8h7	1	*	You can count to potato! In all seriousness, I'd be surprised if he ran for election next term. Don't think he realized how involved being the prez is.

t1_dtj384k	1	*	I've been told (by someone I know) that torture generally works when you and the victim are 100% sure he/she knows what you're trying to get out of them. Does anyone know if this is true?
t1_dtiomn8	1	*	How do you think they recruit new members? 
t1_dtirxai	1	*	Don't forget Stephen Miller. Trump would never have the intellectual capacity to come up with this shit on his own. Punch-A-Miller should be a thing.

t1_dtisddr	1	*	And then he assumed you were a terrorist, put you in Guantanamo Bay, then beat and tortured you for years and years with no hope of release.  #justice #Americafirst.
t1_dtiqgse	1	*	get sent to Australia obviously
t1_dtio5wv	1	*	No one has been sent there in 10 years.  This order implies he plans to send new people there.
t1_dticqaw	0	*	sick and scared lol wtf calm down
t1_dtigo2k	1	*	Horseshit. Obama tried on a number of occasions to close Guantanamo. 
t1_dtjlhyr	1	*	Or maybe put the blame on the Congress who voted with a veto proof majority not to allow funding for any detainees to be moved from Gitmo.
t1_dtiox4c	1	*	Good thing, indeed 
t1_dtiqw1n	1	*	thank you! common sense!
t1_dtiklrw	1	*	OJ wasn't convicted of anything either. That's how good America's legal system is. 
t1_dtinwkd	1	*	It's simple really.  No one wants possible terrorists in their state. That's suicide for your career. No politican on any side will go for it. And if they do, their constituents will apposed it.

t1_dtiinat	0	*	It's actually super impressive that you get away with it... 
t1_dtipunv	0	*	freest for CITIZENS. the guys at guantanamo are not US citizens, they have no rights under US law. and i have no sympathy for terrorists.
t1_dtimc8z	1	*	It's a gang of people FROM el Salvador. Here illegaly and in jail. The founding location is not the issue it's the members. 
t1_dtipq8d	0	*	You have no idea how vial a person can become.  Guantanamo Bay could be a hellhole where human rights are forgotten but that hellhole keeps repulsive beings locked away and forgotten.  
t1_dtigw5o	1	*	They would either be remanded to federal prison or a military brig.

t1_dtj2n23	1	*	Work release...

t1_ds8jho9	1	*	This is speaking about breeding them, not rescuing them. They should no longer be bred.
t1_dsbvf0k	1	*	That's a pretty damn thick thing to say.
t1_ds8vaqh	0	*	I've owned 3 boxers.  I contend that they are the best dogs on the planet in terms of personality.  But yeah.  They seem to have a lot of health issues and a short life span of about a decade.

t1_ds8fy8x	1	*	The dog-lovers who know this information will almost always come to the same course of action: If you find one at a shelter or a rescue group, adopt. DO NOT PAY A BREEDER, they will breed more.
t1_ds8dfwk	1	*	Came here to say something similar. I adopted my old man pug at the young age of 13. He's a happy snortling dofus, and I wouldn't have it any other way.

t1_ds91wys	1	*	Purebred working lines should be selected for health too
t1_ds8lqjj	1	*	There are others in this post saying the same thing. It's absolutely delusional. 
t1_ds8jlan	1	*	They do the same thing with cats. They've even gone so far as to rename the traditional Siamese Cat the Thai Cat to differentiate it from the mutant they've created.

t1_ds8mmpe	1	*	Pet stores like that are absolutely terrible. They get the puppies and kittens from back yard breeders and puppy mills. Theres no reason they should be allowed to be in business. 
t1_ds8fhfl	1	*	Can confirm they are a snoring machine
t1_dsah8i2	1	*	It probably needs its nares opened, that requires surgery though. Shes responsible for taking care of her dog and obviously isnt doing a very good job.
t1_dsaipmx	1	*	Technically yes, since theyre brachycephalic too. But my Boston doesnt have breathing issues so...but since you have a mixed breed you might encounter more problems. Its really hard to say.

t1_dtiv7mt	1	*	Or a screwdriver
t1_dtiyb8w	0	*	Yeah but its an easy way to get your shit stolen or get beaten up because you pinned yourself under a metal bar to have a nap.
t1_dtixq20	1	*	And all those seats have been designed to keep the homeless out 
t1_dtj7n1i	1	*	But spikes and bars are cheaper than that stuff
t1_dtix9xo	0	*	The solution to that is to arrest them not to put random bars on benches like what is that even going to do
t1_dtipbh2	0	*	Dude, read the article. Wrong country...
t1_dtj4ihh	1	*	I am pretty small so I could definitely fit. And I hate bunk beds without rails sooo
t1_dtix086	1	*	That makes me LIVID.
t1_dtizyx2	1	*	There are also those spiky things on the ground underneath the overhead roads to prevent any homeless from taking shelter underneath the roads .
t1_dtj8br2	0	*	This is very hateful. All homeless people are like this, you say?
t1_dtjc1ye	1	*	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysKhbaLyIFw
t1_dtj2q00	1	*	This isn't meant to solve homelessness. It's just meant to prevent benches from being used for sleeping.
t1_dtjii9r	1	*	It solves the problem for those who need a place to sit though, those who are homeless and with homes alike. 
t1_dtj94ey	1	*	That's the problem basically everywhere else 
t1_dtj9u3f	1	*	Same here in NYC. So instead subway cars and front steps to churches and buildings must work
t1_dtj19lx	1	*	Welcome to LA youll fit right in
t1_dtj0sqe	1	*	Looks to me that it would fit 2 average Americans quite comfortably
t1_dtjwdeq	1	*	If you have certain mental illnesses or are abused you're waaay more likely to become an alcoholic or drug addict, so you probably don't sympathize with mentally ill people as much as you think.
t1_dtizbsj	1	*	One could make an one-man tent on that bench.
t1_dtiyffb	0	*	While I think UBI is an interesting idea, it won't solve homelessness by itself. For those with severe mental issues or addicts, simply giving them money won't get them off the street.
t1_dtiokvs	0	*	Actually better. No risk of falling down. 
t1_dtizhz2	0	*	Yes thats the point. Sleep on something that taxpayers didn't build for people to consciously enjoy a park. Or sleep sitting up, or get a job and a bed. 
t1_dtiolbe	1	*	Sitting on? Just a wild guess.
t1_dtj5299	1	*	They could have just made the middle bar look like an arm-rest and nobody would have blinked.
t1_dtjcfsm	1	*	Yeah you nailed it. 
t1_dtjb8i7	1	*	The problem is the visibility, not the actual homelessness.
t1_dtj71s7	1	*	It is not their fault, it is the fault of bankers and capitalist. The solution is to tax capital gains to stop those parasites free loaders from destroying society.    
t1_dtixnvw	1	*	The problem is not homeless sleeping in the streets, it's people taking public structures aimed at people that will sit there for some minutes as their own and making a home out of it.
t1_dtiwcfr	1	*	And honestly they money they probally paid for that could have paid to probally help up some capacity for shelters etc depending on Home much they spent.
t1_dtilmw0	1	*	Housing first is effective, but few taxpayers vote for its advocates.
t1_dtj9vwh	1	*	well you see this article was written in response to a specific event and not a generic concept, this is how the news works
t1_dtiwsov	1	*	You're a city council, but we do not grant you the rank of master.
t1_dtiusmo	1	*	A public council help people in need? How does that make them wealthier?
t1_dtjj622	1	*	Yeap, same sitch for Australia U0001f613
t1_dtiyxhh	1	*	That would make a great Viz Magazine reader letter
t1_dtj3c9e	1	*	It's a problem you can't solve, you can only reduce the impact. There will always be homeless individuals due to a large number of factors including mental illness. 
t1_dtj3ob7	1	*	Homeless people cost 20k/year in things like nhs bills as a result of sleeping rough.                     You could just send them to a boarding school
t1_dtiwis2	1	*	Precisely
t1_dtiwbx1	1	*	Get some blow and a hooker...
t1_du80uq4	1	*	If the system if corrupt then  they need an exam where it is fairly obvious whether or not a student has give the correct answer to a question.
t1_du8krpi	1	*	UP = Florida of India
t1_du85jtw	0	*	Wait you dont have long answer questions at exams in America? Wtf
t1_du82sd7	0	*	If its' actually a million how the fuck do you figure saying that it's half a million is an exaggeration?
t1_du786mw	1	*	Is it cheating if its allowed?
t1_du8kqrk	1	*	It's a real thing and actually quite scary. 
t1_du7yvk5	0	*	You cannot generalize the whole country for the deeds of a particular person. India is too vast and diverse to stereotype.
t1_du85ml0	1	*	Well you learn them through the year?
t1_duwgkfl	0	*	No,  read the article and  it gets better. The boys parents are in denial that he could even do such a thing

t1_ds4j1pd	1	*	I think my mom played that.
t1_ds4ivlz	0	*	I'm waiting for South Africa's previous (since two weeks ago) President Zuma to sue them for using his name... 
t1_dt9sjy1	1	*	Did you read the article though? It's like saying that I am ready to kill all of my coworkers because I happen to have a knife at home. It's being blown completely out of proportion
t1_du54w2o	1	*	need to rethink this one.  whio.com: Mirai Nagasu first US female skater to land triple axel at Olympics
t1_du55zaw	0	*	> There [sic] really playing this up.  Aggravated assault at the very least and potential federal terrorism charges? Nah: sounds pretty serious.
t1_dthbq5r	1	*	In many countries it is. In Iran it is not.
t1_dthc12t	1	*	Because Iran actively forces women to wear the hijab, while women in Western countries have the choice.
t1_ds3m8c6	1	*	Nah, these predictions are quite accurate.
t1_dsrp75v	0	*	1080ti was released in 2017...
t1_dsrlpq5	1	*	Im in the market for an upgrade.  Waiting for the blockchains to calm the F down
t1_dsrpnv2	1	*	It is a correction though. Bitcoin is volatile. 
t1_dstag8n	1	*	Damn, maybe I should have held onto those 25 cents I mined. I'd be $10 richer now.
t1_dsrxiwn	1	*	It will eventually lose 100% of it's value.
t1_dssnlqg	1	*	10% is a correction. 40% off highs set a couple weeks ago is a crash.
t1_dst7fm7	1	*	Pretty much,    it's really amazing how many times people will fall for China's FUD.    THEY WILL BUY IN LOW LIKE ALL YOU SHOULD BE.... 
t1_dsthi7r	1	*	Unless its banned...
t1_dsrlgvh	0	*	Jesus fuck, it's been wild watching that price chart eh?
t1_dsrnoj2	0	*	It's literally happened like 4 or 5 times already...
t1_dss33x8	1	*	I too would like to see it crash into the ground, so I can buy more really cheap and sit on it for 5 years :)
t1_dsrf5be	1	*	They are trying to extract themselves as miners too.
t1_dss4n4j	1	*	You say that like its a chore for him.
t1_dssv3kw	1	*	Bitcoin or black, either way LET IT RIDE!!
t1_dssrr3k	1	*	Why would crypto threaten central banking? None of the coins are used as currency, it's all speculative.
t1_dssmjut	1	*	4 words:  Always Be Buying Bitcoin!
t1_dst6maf	1	*	Why just borrow a little? Take your **entire** kids college fund and invest NOW! Youll make it all back and then some! It definitely isnt a bubble just waiting to pop. DEFINITELY.
t1_dssatpn	1	*	A 40% correction is nothing new to bitcoin. Happened multiple times in the past year.
t1_dtfzhe3	0	*	Doesn't the gov't pay 3rd party small businesses to lay the wires? Wouldn't he want one of his companies to get a big pay day?
t1_dt9w8gd	0	*	Nah, Saudi Arabia and Israel have grown really close these past few months. During the Syrian civil war, they've become united by their mutual hatred of Iran.  
t1_dta2hi6	0	*	Even if it's true, grain of salt- SA is trying to placate the west with social stuff, while ramping up war crimes in Yemen and bracing for full on war with Iran.  
t1_dt9z3dr	1	*	Would you rather they didn't hold it?  
t1_dta5ed8	1	*	In the Middle East, it probably is.
t1_dtabxy4	1	*	Maybe you shouldn't base all of your knowledge of Iran on Ahmadinejad. 
t1_duuwodb	1	*	Again again?
t1_du6e9d1	0	*	All you would need is a pc with internet though...
t1_du7l91v	1	*	Because talking about politics is gauche  As if this was fucking politics.

t1_dto3vjn	1	*	Seriously, they could have inflicted so much more damage just by keeping the contents secret. So dumb.
t1_dtp9ysw	1	*	Thank you very much! Was wondering were I could find some actual unbiased details and discussion. After going over to that thread it's like night and day compared to this sub.

t1_dtf9ae1	1	*	Is that an article? What a pile...
t1_dsu2lcn	0	*	Democracy is functioning as we comment on this subreddit.   Why would it need to be reestablished?   The very fact that we are free to do so is emblematic of the functioning of democracy. 
t1_dt6lco2	0	*	No he wasn't. The only physical poll about this was Datafolha's, with 2500 (LOL) votes. Also, Datafolha is accused of corruption as well.  Check any online poll and you'll see very different results.
t1_dt6qeqt	0	*	Besides corruption allegations, are the policies he implemented while in office universally popular now? From the little I know he seems to have had great success with programs like Bolsa Famxedlia. 
t1_dt6r7l3	0	*	That's not true. He wasn't convicted solely on that. There was much more. Don't spread disinformation.
t1_dt71ef3	1	*	He is a left wing populist who endangers the status quo in one of the most unequal countries in the world.   This was a political trial
t1_du6itz3	1	*	So Muslims are animals? With a worldview like that, it is pretty clear who the animal is.

t1_du6r3f2	1	*	woah there chief he didnt win the first round whats got you thinking its a clear shot for round two 
t1_du6p4h6	1	*	One of the things I love about Israel is the number of their citizens who acknowledge the terrible crimes they are committing.  It's a minority of citizens, but still...
t1_du6rpj0	1	*	Streisand Effect over a movie depicting fictional events?  Lol. 
t1_du6p6no	1	*	ironically by pirating it
t1_du6ijlh	1	*	ungrateful, rich, hypocrite citizens!

t1_du6k9en	1	*	Thats why i love every person in the world and feel every government are pieces of shit though.

t1_du6ro76	1	*	They're boycotting something organised by their own citizens.  Really nothing new for anywhere.  
t1_du6sull	1	*	Finally, a sane comment on this thread that clearly explains why this article is misleading... Thank you.
t1_du7cooa	1	*	So? Taxi Driver was boo'ed at Cannes when it won the Palm d'Or. The people that live in Israel may have different ideas than the government of Israel have.
t1_du7vznc	1	*	Nope. Ambassador just isn't attending an Israeli film festival. You didn't read the article you sad pathetic antisemite.
t1_du88c8g	1	*	Unfortunately you are the only one bringing religion into the game in case you didn't pay attention: We're talking here about the country of Israel not the religion judaism.
t1_du6urbr	1	*	Exactly, it's been done to death. They're boycotting it because it's not headlining something new.
t1_du6xknd	1	*	anytime you get a several decade guerrilla war with local insurgents it gets sketchy and brutal with warcrimes by all sides.
t1_du6hvpp	1	*	Then it's ok to Boycott. There is nothing antisemitic about that if Israel does it to Israel.  
t1_du6uehd	1	*	People wouldn't do that though would they? Just go into the world trying to hold back their own people? /s
t1_du6rvyn	1	*	Fwiw, it won an Oscar (in Israel mind you), so it should be a fairly good movie
t1_du6p0tq	1	*	Doesn't Israel have mandatory service?
t1_du6zk2c	1	*	> he director even fought for Israel  That's not saying much seeing as all citizens are required to enter the service. 
t1_du6lj0m	1	*	>Palestine invaded the territory of Israel   It looks like you also dont support history books or facts. /s 
t1_du6v9bw	0	*	>regev is my next-door neighbour  Lmao that's quite the claim there
t1_du7vc1k	1	*	Correct. Since all it is the ambassador not attending an Israeli film festival. Film isn't illegal or anything. Guess you didn't read the article.
t1_du6kyh7	0	*	So the headline is true... there is a boycott (at least planned) by their own cultural minister. Seems to me like this propaganda is actually very true.

t1_du6w9zl	1	*	Thank you
t1_du6r19f	1	*	Israelis are not a homogeneous population. They can have different and even opposing views. There are Israelis who hate Palestinians and there are Israelis who love Palestinians.
t1_du6m4vy	1	*	Nope. Not misleading. Times of Israel reported this too.
t1_du6i7xe	1	*	The movie flowed like butta!
t1_duhdkdo	1	*	Definitely intended. Mistakes like that do NOT happen in such a diplomatic setting. The chinese are just trying to see what they can get away with

t1_dunttsu	1	*	At the same time an anonymous system like this can be used to hurt good people too.
t1_duom3qa	0	*	Matriarchal. our chaebals are run by a cabal of 4 women.

t1_dunp7mm	0	*	What's that? 
t1_dunna1x	1	*	Harassment isn't really about sex as much as it's about trying to diminish the other person, it's about enforcing your power over them
t1_dsy273c	1	*	No, it fucking doesn't.
t1_dtt05o6	1	*	Anything done will fuel their rhetoric, that isn't a fire that can be put out.
t1_dtsx4qn	1	*	I like the attitude. At a point you need to get the bodies out of there but right on!
t1_dttlgb2	1	*	I'm thinking it's probably too intensive of a process. 
t1_dspypem	1	*	he he he he ho ho ho ho
t1_dswjf48	0	*	2017 was the second hottest year since recording began in 1880. Only 2016 was warmer.
t1_dswmikk	1	*	He in fact didnt say the sea would swallow us by now.
t1_dtqqtyw	0	*	Iran isn't. China is building hypersonic missiles. Russia is developing new nukes though. 
t1_dseqiqm	1	*	Could both apply?
t1_ds1i171	1	*	Let's see if it's more than just words as usual.
t1_ds1jri4	0	*	MSM is disgusting and has been disgusting for decades
t1_ds1ejoo	1	*	Attack us on a regular basis.....exactly how many attacks did you get...???!!! It is pakistani blood more than anyone that got sacrificed to this war US created
t1_ds1bb70	1	*	Let's just alienate another nuclear power!   The money keeps those nukes from falling into the wrong hands. 
t1_ds1vfmw	1	*	A president not holding up to campaign promises?  quick stop the presses. What a hot take opinion over here
t1_ds1p8dp	1	*	 I dont doubt it but thats not how trump works, the real question is what is happening in Washington right now that he is distracting the public from.
t1_ds2lfdi	1	*	attacks slams condemn all meaningless words to me now. Especially condemn.
t1_ds1h7wu	1	*	Agreed. But this was too brash, quiet diplomacy would be more effective than tweeting
t1_ds1guaj	1	*	Yeah most Americans are waking up with hangovers currently. In Russia they've mostly gotten rid of their hangovers, and are back to work.
t1_ds1e753	0	*	They didn't give up Bin Laden. US intel sources found out where he was staying and Obama decided to fly into Pakistan without asking for the assassination. 
t1_ds1hz1q	1	*	He got one! Finally. 
t1_ds1gkdc	1	*	Even a blind monkey finds a banana every now and then...

t1_ds1gcfx	0	*	So, the Soviet withdrawal had nothing to do with it?  Seriously? We're now blaming Pakistan for the shit that soviets did?
t1_ds1f1gl	1	*	while your point is 100% valid, frankly I don't think any president/powerful politician can be critical of SA, everything is too fucked up there, it's binded in blood.
t1_ds22h96	1	*	Exactly , I thought oh for fuck sake, it is only the first or 2nd day of the year , and mr orange is already trying to start a war ? Fuck me
t1_ds1oafj	1	*	Yes, yes he is. I hate myself right now.
t1_ds1d4nm	1	*	What problem does China have with Pakistan? Anyway, the majority of Pakistanis detest India, Afghanistan, and the US so don't exactly care all to much about what the government supports there or not.
t1_ds1objt	1	*	This guy got 3800 upvotes/hour. Yep seems about right, assuming there was not a single downvote.
t1_ds1mbm8	1	*	NK is China's bitch. You don't mess with someone's bitch.
t1_ds25leg	1	*	I think we can deduce what the most popular New Years resolution was for 2018 gauging by these reactions.
t1_ds1irzf	1	*	For once I actually agree with Trump. 
t1_ds2gfg4	0	*	Maybe you should reconsider Trump, apart from what the media says. Maybe consider an alternate position on Trump?
t1_ds1t0we	0	*	All the top comments literally just say u no, hes rite wtf are you talking about
t1_ds25wu9	1	*	I'd rather be friends with India than Pakistan.  Pakistan is China's friend so the downside is Pakistan becomes a powder keg.
t1_ds1hdud	1	*	I think Pakistan is shitty at hiding people. Loads of them died for some reason in Pakistan. 
t1_ds1fux9	0	*	While he may be right about this, I still despise that he uses TWITTER to fucking announce these things. WWIII is going to start because of a twitter post.
t1_ds1oc7t	0	*	No, this is exactly the story he would get. Pakistan has been a safe-haven for the Taliban for a decade (plus). 
t1_ds1vtqq	1	*	He literally raped them with his words. 
t1_ds21f1u	0	*	Attacks is in the title of the article  Did you want OP to change it?
t1_ds1qn7i	1	*	It's because it's New Year's Eve and Shareblue has the day off. Wait for tomorrow when these paid shills are back to work.
t1_ds1f7iu	1	*	He needs something to rile up his base and distract from important news coming out.

t1_ds23ss6	0	*	What wall?
t1_ds1ecdd	0	*	New year, new Trump?
t1_ds1g1fp	1	*	So you made a new account just so you could rant Pakistan? Typical Indian behavior.
t1_ds21jco	1	*	It not being untrue doesn't make saying it out loud any less foolish and counter productive. 
t1_ds1i7vv	1	*	It's one of the more corrupt govt.s in the world.  Did he just wake up and realize all this shit?
t1_ds1qp2m	1	*	Wasn't expecting this to be at the top 
t1_ds1hizr	1	*	You're just not use to America having a REAL leader.  But what do I know, I live in a igloo far up  Canada. 
t1_ds1hizy	1	*	He isn't actually tough, just a loudmouth.
t1_ds1ebcp	0	*	Trump doesnt give time tables. You can probably be sure hes already done something to fuck with them and the tweet is just making the issue come to light so we pay attention. 
t1_ds1eev6	1	*	so how many times America violated Pakistan's sovereignty? 
t1_ds1h1z9	0	*	Political shrapnel
t1_ds1zuvf	1	*	Trump LASHES OUT and Pakistan CLAPS BACK   
t1_ds1gahm	1	*	I don't know enough about what the foreign aid payments involved to determine whether or not they were useless. I suspect Trump and most people in this thread don't either. 
t1_ds21b8c	1	*	Everyone seems to forgot that.
t1_ds1f28m	1	*	China loves Trump, not sure if they would give a shit about Pakistan or not.
t1_ds1erz6	1	*	Oil? Military bases?
t1_ds1fnag	1	*	Trump isn't always wrong.  Sometimes I wonder if there was some strategic reason that W Bush and Obama put up with Pakistan's crap that could not be easily explained to the media. 
t1_ds1wdsg	1	*	Yeah and they buried his body in my backyard lmao.
t1_ds1cm1i	1	*	But I thought that Trump was the devil or the reincarnation of Hitler!
t1_ds1s5q1	1	*	Too bad were probably never getting India as a really close ally [since the US and UK tried to siege india and russia stopped it](https://youtu.be/2B9YIrw9fPk)
t1_ds1jz7z	1	*	Not sure what move you mean. Stating the obvious and doing nothing anout it?
t1_ds1f3gh	1	*	Thats correct, but their airspace is also the only way to get supplies to Afghanistan. 
t1_ds2kaly	1	*	>Edit: wish Trump tweets this picture to nail Pakistan: **https://i.imgur.com/K6yHFro.jpg**  Did you tweet it at him? Our president is much more accessible than our last one. 
t1_ds1dmdy	1	*	Actually I got a nice rug from there too.
t1_ds1firg	1	*	Evidence of no 5?
t1_ds1fs3b	0	*	And diplomacy got us....where?
t1_ds1wzw6	1	*	Soviet Union surplus and America.   What can I buy with my ten points?
t1_ds1efbs	0	*	But why tweet it? How is that acceptable presidential behavior?
t1_ds1ejkl	1	*	Huh. 2018 Christmas came early...
t1_ds1f56t	1	*	Sure he is. He's also openly attacking a nuclear power we have a tenuous relationship with.
t1_ds1j8jx	1	*	I think we both know the answer to that....
t1_ds1klar	0	*	An Indian pretending to be a Pakistani? The name checks out!
t1_ds20hx8	1	*	This particular source heavily sensationalizes things regularly. I never take any of their headlines at face value. 
t1_ds1rffu	1	*	To be fair, this wasn't an issue with previous presidents since you knew a physical attack was an impossibility.
t1_ds1rebz	1	*	This is precisely it. The US is doing its best to contain China. 
t1_ds1eo8k	1	*	Really just use a different route and for heavens sake leave us alone
t1_ds1ee10	1	*	The USA were the ones who created these extremists in the first place while fighting Russia. And now it is their fault? Fuck you and Fuck USA, fuckin hypocrite society
t1_ds1kmbn	1	*	And how is that different from supporting any other militant group, by any other state? You cant ask other states to stop stuff that you then go ahead and do yourself.
t1_ds1i3tj	1	*	Cant we just glass the whole country and be done?
t1_ds1x2om	1	*	Well when you're talk about a dog that's all bark and no bite, it's about as close to an attack as you're gunna get.
t1_ds1ifqf	1	*	Did you not read a single comment?
t1_ds1fjce	0	*	Non-experts have been saying this since at least 2005.
t1_ds1o16b	1	*	We Pakistani are used to handle this kind of attacks since very long. We have been in trouble for the last 18 years just due to US war in Afghanistan.
t1_ds1flap	1	*	Yeah. He is right on this one. Broken clock. I dont think there is any canal or straight or river we get access to via aid to them...
t1_ds1edr4	1	*	Even a broken clock is right twice a day! 
t1_ds1m54z	1	*	>  paying people who don't like you to like you does not work. They take the money and laugh at you.  just like nice guys buying gifts for women !!
t1_ds1pynf	1	*	The 'what' is not wrong, but the 'how' is
t1_ds1f1kt	1	*	oh yes lets not piss off the people trying to kill us
t1_ds1rw9h	1	*	When Trump does it, its an attack. Anyone else its a criticism.   Trump can say I dont like hot dogs and the headline would be Trump attacks hot dog industry
t1_ds1yiv7	1	*	Same also for Afghanistan. Tribal territories. You want to win the war in Afghan? Don't go there. The British Empire couldn't win, the USSR neither. 
t1_ds1gu1b	1	*	But will T do something or is this just another breeze of Cheeto-smelling air?
t1_ds1j4kr	1	*	Canada shelters terrorist as well, infact they try to rehabilitate them. 
t1_ds1jpdu	1	*	Like that would stop them? Lololololol
t1_ds1ges5	1	*	One of the few areas where Trump and I get along... Tired of the way we work with Pakistan and others. Hope he gets to Saudi, though.
t1_ds1ld91	1	*	That central Asian region around Pakistan is arguably the most important in the world.
t1_ds1f4o0	1	*	Friends with us????? What friendliness have you shown us? The reason you do not have allies you want is becz your strategies suck. Americans are world wide known as Stupid anyways  
t1_ds1oqvi	1	*	Trump SLAMS Pakistan in recent tweet
t1_ds1g6jr	1	*	L O L

t1_ds1ffea	1	*	Do you even know who created Usama...its US itself , they created him for soviet union. Now that the creations of US bit it a little, its our fault??? No your fault for playing with other countries
t1_ds1gteg	1	*	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistan_and_state-sponsored_terrorism
t1_ds1g8s5	1	*	What just happen? The top comment agrees with Trump? 
t1_ds2pp7w	1	*	It's the independent. Honestly, articles on that site shouldn't be allowed on r/worldnews. 
t1_ds1m550	1	*	Yes, since the current stance has been so successful.
t1_ds1qwsw	1	*	Trump has a spaz and says something that the corperate media won't say ever. Not the first time and it won't be the last.
t1_ds1f54h	1	*	Hes too proud to admit that to himself. He just wants them to keep doing it to feed the ego. 
t1_ds1b6qz	1	*	As they say, even a broken clock is right twice a day. 
t1_ds1xcab	1	*	A stopped clock is right twice a day.
t1_ds1e8ux	1	*	It's a New Year's miracle!
t1_ds1jk6j	1	*	Yeah for once I'm on the Donald's side. Maybe his new years resolution was to stop lying on Twitter.   (And like most resolutions this one will last a week, tops) 
t1_ds1ov14	1	*	It's as if both things could be a problem! Gasp!
t1_ds1kpj4	1	*	It's not about whether he's right or wrong, it's about what's strategic. 
t1_ds1edev	1	*	Read the thread. 
t1_ds1eiml	1	*	Even a broken watch is right twice a day.
t1_ds1g76e	1	*	I was hoping this was true, lol.
t1_ds29uf5	1	*	SLAMS! DESTROYS! ATTACKS!  Welcome to the click-bait age of news.
t1_ds1ians	1	*	I could get used to that. 
t1_ds23t6q	1	*	January 1st is a holiday. A certain group whose name starts with an S are on vacation.
t1_ds1gui7	0	*	Maybe his odd numbered years are cursed.
t1_ds1ie3o	1	*	I came to the comments expecting an anti-Trump circle jerk. Glad to see this at the top.
t1_ds1kvtc	1	*	Its insane how confirming that Trump said something accurate is gold-worthy. 
t1_ds1l9eu	0	*	Aid money is going to your generals. ask them...
t1_ds1e5lx	1	*	Youre awfully excited in this thread mr modi
t1_ds1f2s1	1	*	Wow, I am suprised and very happy to see this as top comment here. I hate the man but it's good to see that this sub isn't so bitter that it refuses to acknowledge anything he does right
t1_ds1g62k	1	*	Best thing about trump is his bluntness.
t1_ds1j60h	0	*	Posting the same thing 10 times doesn't make it any more true...
t1_ds1r750	1	*	Big words but no plan. 
t1_ds1ekxr	1	*	What's the aid for?
t1_ds1gg51	1	*	Um excuse me sir, agreeing with trump is not allowed on Reddit /s
t1_ds1dcrt	1	*	Came here to basically say this. I'm not a Trump fan, but give credit where its due: Trump is right this time.
t1_ds1wtvt	1	*	Lets declare war on article titles!
t1_ds1zsfq	0	*	Yeah I read this and was expecting to be the only person to think there's at least a hint of truth to this
t1_ds1e251	1	*	He had to be eventually.  He talks shit about everyone, sooner or later he was bound to talk about someone who had earned it.
t1_ds1jpj5	0	*	If you claim to have a lack of knowledge how can you praise him for something? What lol  Selling billions of dollars in weapons to Saudi is most definitely not good.
t1_ds1fmvk	1	*	Yeah he is definitely calling it like it is. About time.
t1_ds1m8m9	1	*	Actually if you took the trouble to Google and read up a bit you'd find that  India became less neutral because the US sided with Pakistan, not the other way round
t1_ds1ls4w	1	*	How long have we known this, and why we still sending aid. I'm new to this topic.
t1_ds1v7js	1	*	Not about stopping aid. All that's going to do is allow China, Russia, or someone else to step into our spot.
t1_ds1hzpy	1	*	Correct or not: It's just words. I'm more interested in what he's going to do.
t1_ds1ggj4	0	*	Especially with this president. I literally thought he'd  bombed them or something. 
t1_ds1h5iz	1	*	The question is whether an angry tweet on New Years is the most effective way to deal with this. The answer is no.
t1_ds1y794	1	*	>knew and did nothing? Knew and hid him from the US FTFY
t1_ds1dygd	1	*	Someone who told him what to say maybe,  he has no clue about any of it.
t1_ds1r2kl	1	*	I think berates would be more fitting. 
t1_dugnt8r	1	*	He has a goal though, more than can be said for quite a lot of people 
t1_dtdr8tc	1	*	Niinistxf6 said that Lennu has been taking a break from social media and is watching the election from his sofa at home
t1_du5ngqh	1	*	What powers do they have that they shouldnt? Ice handles illegal immigrants...?
t1_du5q31r	0	*	General, I'd follow you into battle any day.
t1_duur8ff	1	*	Americaaaa FUCK YEAH FREEDOM!!!!11 FREEDOM OR DEATH!!!111
t1_duwervo	0	*	You could of course provide them access to your shower so they could clean themselves and not smell as much, instead of just complaining about the smell. 
t1_dsdoknz	1	*	There is that one football player so dangerous they made holes in his car.
t1_dt9lg5l	1	*	lol
t1_dty1t4s	1	*	I think it's saying that male uber drivers arrive at locations slightly faster, so they earn more per hour. The study was adjusted for hours. 
t1_dszw8jt	0	*	And yet the USA which has actually invaded 5 countries and killed millions of civilians is allowed to participate. Hmm.  Perspective friend.
t1_dt3u37n	0	*	And maintain those sanctuary cities!
t1_dtqbecv	1	*	It is an inherently racist state.  It is part of the reason that they have a bad rap.
t1_dtqs70c	1	*	Eritrea is basically North Korea minus the nukes, it's absolutely a place to seek asylum from.
t1_dtqwtvp	1	*	Double standards undoubtedly exist. 
t1_dtpufo8	0	*	You mean news related to how a country is reacting to world events ending up on /r/worldnews? Shocker 
t1_dtqtfwa	1	*	> But if whites even mention the fact that they want a white majority country, they lose their job, get death threats and sometimes they get physically assaulted.  Well, there is r/the_donald.
t1_dtqu4bj	0	*	> it is incredibly ironic that Israel has an issue with illegal immigrants.  TBH, every country has an issue with illegal immigrants.
t1_dtq5xm9	1	*	Only if you accept the headline as accurate
t1_dtqwo0i	1	*	hmm when did that ever happen before 
t1_dtq5qr7	1	*	For some weird totally coincidental reasons, most western countries are under pressure to offer amnesty to illegals. Except Israel.
t1_dtr1l26	1	*	>or Rwanda  I didn't know countries could outsource their refugees.
t1_dtqp6i0	0	*	If only the Palestinians had done that and nipped the Jewish invasion in the bud. Oh weight, wrong narrative; my bad!
t1_dtqmpsh	1	*	They're not calling for their death. It is apartheid. It is systematic oppression or the indigenous Palestinians. It is Nazi-like ghettos they've created.
t1_dtqb8r0	0	*	In what way is it hypocritical?
t1_dtqtzt6	1	*	Do those countries include United States?
t1_dtqiwdj	1	*	Trains?
t1_dtq1u53	1	*	I guess that's why they called it Exodus.
t1_du1gz0s	1	*	You mean to tell me Netanyahu is colluding with the Iranians and asked them to infiltrate Israeli airspace with a drone?! Scandalous!
t1_du1tmla	1	*	Golan Heights belongs more time to Israel when it belonged to Syria.
t1_du19jwc	1	*	Agreed, Israel is probably already planning a massive airstrip response to wipe out anything not operated by the Russians.
t1_du1e1b6	1	*	Nuclear bombs?
t1_du0xssq	1	*	Nope.
t1_du1aqht	0	*	Poor Israelis, having to listen to all those alarms. Meanwhile people in Syria and Palestine are actually killed by Israelis 
t1_du15vlq	1	*	There was also a report of downed Apache, not confirmed and Erdogan announced that they lost a heli around Afrin. Bad day for invaders.
t1_du0x9le	1	*	There is not going to be a full blown regional war over one plane with no Israeli casualties. Maybe some UN meetings or some other garbage.
t1_du11rxa	1	*	Well, who???
t1_du1vlkf	1	*	what?! NO! /s

t1_du2y5x6	0	*	And yet Americans cant seem to get a train to work without crashing. 
t1_du3340z	1	*	Depends on the flight. If it's a longer flight, they'll fly higher.
t1_du33cl9	1	*	Payback? This was not Putin's plane. It was a bunch of innocent civilians.   The Russian people are in no way our enemy, their government is.

t1_du2yb8n	1	*	Err.  1000m per minute is 60km per HR.  Perhaps you have wrong data for speed?

t1_dtn3q6z	1	*	Decisions on the specific claims about individuals will be left to the courts and to police.  It is an inquiry, not a court. They can't rule on anything even if they wanted to.

t1_dtk6m1v	1	*	Oooh weve got a spicy one! 
t1_dtk2cah	1	*	Whats sad is all this will eventually come out with evidence and youll still be defending a corrupt reality TV star. Whats ironic is you probably think youre an actual patriot.

t1_dtajac3	1	*	That's a pretty Fascist, frankly. 
t1_dt9wopr	0	*	Meanwhile, in the US many people have a newfound tendency to call any racist redneck they find a Nazi. Pull that shit in Germany and you get a resounding, yeahhhhh, no. 
t1_dt9z30f	1	*	An entitled one.

t1_dta2kpp	0	*	Yeah you go right ahead and call a NYC or Detroit police officer a fat cunt you be beaten and then gunned down on the spot and then sprinkled with pcp
t1_dta79bb	1	*	>I think the Germans are almost the worst people to call Nazis. Second to the Jewish people, of course.  As if that will stop people from doing so. Nazi gets thrown around so easily now.

t1_dtbbk89	1	*	Check out her Twitter avatar. Stable Genius  Yeah. Sure. 
t1_dta88v6	1	*	It's also against the law to insult German citizens in public.
t1_dtaj1as	1	*	I remember reading her side of the story recently too - because shes a nut and made it all public. She managed to come across as such a nut bag in her own words that this barely surprises me. 
t1_dta9kfx	1	*	Shes not crazy, just American. 
t1_dtailv2	1	*	True she was breaking rules set forth by the US homeland security, and was acting like an idiot. But is calling someone a Nazi a crime in Germany?
t1_dta6itw	1	*	  >But both really don't like being called Nazis.   As a German in reddit you get used to it. It wears off after a while so you just go meh.
t1_dtaha74	1	*	A lot of big fans of free speech, I see.
t1_dtand3m	1	*	Lol Nazi calls Germany German word.
t1_dtahlt7	1	*	So she was imprisoned? Crazy.. i thought she lost a deo abd needed to pay a fine. Did not know they will hang her next week.
t1_dtanmmc	1	*	Pretty sure she's on her way to unemployment with this situation, her handling of it and now her behavior on Twitter. Especially when she name drops the school at any given opportunity.
t1_dtbia7o	1	*	Have you read a history book like...ever?  Went to school?  It looks like you have about 0 knowledge of what the word nazi actually means.
t1_dtahv0g	1	*	In 2018 you can.
t1_dt9wbkz	0	*	I can second this. I have some German relations and I jokingly made the Hitler salute in front of them when I was very young. They didn't talk to me for days and I couldn't understand why.
t1_dta0i6s	0	*	lol
t1_dtafusm	1	*	American police would rather shoot than sue.

t1_dt9x03j	0	*	How is freedom of speech affected here in any way?
t1_dtah0m4	1	*	Yea you can say this seems a bit fascist to me without bringing the Nazis into it.  You're in Germany, have some self awareness...ignoring the lack of common sense in the first place.
t1_dt9yo32	1	*	When I was 12 I jokingly called a girl in my class a Nazi infront of the teacher. He fucking kicked me out of that lesson because that shit is not funny right here. 
t1_dta46fh	1	*	The liberal kind
t1_dtaud50	1	*	> Free Speech in Germany is NOT the same as it is in the US  As in it doesn't fucking exist in Germany. It's illegal to insult someone in public in Germany. What a bunch of a fucking nazis.
t1_dta6i4w	1	*	I get so anxious in airports that I would probably throw away my cell phone if they asked me to so not to cause a fuss.  Can't imagine getting this way over a deodorant..
t1_dt9wv6q	0	*	Right, we can't have people speaking their minds now can we.
t1_dta8u52	1	*	How dare they take away your Freedom fragrance?
t1_dtacos5	1	*	Free speech is not the same because it's not free speech
t1_dta8f9q	1	*	Just look at Logan Paul and other American-being-rude cases and you will see a pattern. It's not just casuality.
t1_dtajmyd	1	*	I've actually had to explain to people why calling me or my family members Nazis  (jokingly) was offensive.
t1_dt9wdgo	0	*	Why would they attack her for calling them 'Nazis'? I think you're being overdramatic there bud. 
t1_dta3k6l	1	*	On the other hand EU and International Regs On liquids on transport are and should be considered stupid 
t1_dta6g5h	1	*	apparently calling someone a nazi = being a nazi.

t1_dt9qsq4	0	*	Yeah, you know, she also wrote an article about it on a pretty big website...so that would probably qualify.
t1_dta4ji5	0	*	DAMN how far I had to scroll down to find a comment like this.  I feel like I'm going crazy! THANK YOU.
t1_dta8g1v	1	*	Sounds like pretty much any american tourist ive met
t1_dt9zzbr	1	*	Think of it like being called Amerikkkan, but a few orders of magnitude worse.
t1_dt9rki2	0	*	>counter intuitive  If you have to counter intuition to not call someone a Nazi, then you have to worry more about self control and your perception of things rather than laws. 
t1_dta1898	0	*	I do not think you understand German law or culture. I live in Belgium, if I call a police officer or someone working at the airport a nazi, I would probably also be arrested. Which makes sense. 
t1_dtakuwo	1	*	She makes a better case than most people who call others a Nazi these days 
t1_dtannk9	0	*	Read her 4000 word tirade on Huffington post first then answer your own question. 
t1_dta3s0r	1	*	One single deodorant? Thats what the nazis want you to believe. 
t1_dta87j3	0	*	Its their law, so I fully support them pursing any applicable charges against her.
t1_dtauus2	0	*	The US has a dark history involving racism.  Would you be in favor of a US law allowing people to sue for getting called a racist without evidence to support this claim?
t1_dt9yi9x	1	*	With a master's in BS

t1_dt9vtuj	0	*	My engineer thesis had like 9000 words wtf
t1_dta678u	0	*	Its amazing how upset this woman got. Yes, deodorant is technically a solid. But its *still* not allowed in carryon luggage. 
t1_dtae7v0	1	*	Not to mention all of the unnecessarily hyperbolic and r/iamverysmart language she shoehorned in wherever she could.
t1_dta3alo	1	*	Americans like to call that they are don't like nazis. 
t1_dtan5le	0	*	Right.. she could have either just thrown the deodorant away or put it in another bag and suddenly it escalates to her calling two cops nazi's.. tell me how shes standing up to them why don't you.
t1_dta2jiw	1	*	Did...did she tried typical American yelling till gets free stuff from manager? :D
t1_dtawanz	1	*	They are not sending their best 
t1_dt9zn7j	1	*	How is this a free speech issue? In what way exactly? It's slander, simple as that.
t1_dta436y	1	*	Also because that Hitler's youth haircut was probably just a normal, classic male haircut not some really specific nazi-style.
t1_dtaconm	0	*	Hmmm, where can you fuck the police? Certainly not in the US.
t1_dtascyl	0	*	Hate speech and name calling is not protected under free speech.

t1_dt9zpkf	1	*	How is this legal? Does Germany not have the equivalent of the first amendment? 
t1_dt9xw5v	1	*	I hope the whole time they addressed her only as *Professor*, in a sarcastically courteous way.
t1_dta3dqg	0	*	Hijacking top comment to add that in germany there's also a thing called Beamtenbeleidigung (insult of a public official), which makes it by default a crime when you go insult the police
t1_dtahpqg	1	*	I mean... according to (parts of) reddit Ben Shapiro is a Nazi.
t1_dt9wfbh	1	*	maybe in the US. In Germany they have very restrictive laws against a lot of things related to the Third Reich.
t1_dtbxlcn	1	*	Seriously, you call American cops Nazis and you're asking to be tackled and restrained, bare minimum.
t1_dta1jja	1	*	Americans... fuck no!
t1_dta0p3e	1	*	I know right. Lol. 
t1_dtak2z1	0	*	So you are fucking yourself? How is it going?
t1_dtag0wa	1	*	Insult vs attack on character. Calling someone a dickhead = insult. Calling someone a racist or nazi = attack on character = grounds for civil suits
t1_dta71ht	0	*	im sure airport security on any airport lets you get inside the plane with any amount of liquids of your choice. Only in Germania they follow the rules imposed by what country exactly?

t1_dt9xxd4	0	*	in austria i think you can get arrested for it. 
t1_dta8vyu	1	*	so because you have an opinion, let's incarcerate everyone who doesn't agree with you? sounds like a typical top reddit comment 
t1_dtaegca	1	*	One single deodorant and a lifetime of ignorance can go a long way.
t1_dt9whmg	1	*	Did you read her version of events, or even the linked article?  Based on the fact that you downvoted me within seconds of posting, I am going to guess that the answer is a resounding no.
t1_dtasaqo	1	*	Read her article.. its hilarious how much entitlement a feminist road warriro professor can have.
t1_dtav39e	1	*	If you think german airports are bad, do yourself a favour and avoid turkish ones, its 10 times worse...
t1_dt9zjev	1	*	I know, right? Those fucking feminazis better watch out
t1_dta8ld4	1	*	Nagger isn't that offensive tbf.
t1_dt9x6zy	1	*	If someone wants to know how german police behaves, search for toto und harry on youtube. That is pretty much on point.
t1_dta1rx2	0	*	Germans tend to have a low threshold when it comes to being called Nazis. I can't say that I blame them.
t1_dta7s9y	0	*	You think Hitler and the Nazi party liked Muslims? Jesus Christ, you might want to pick up a history book.
t1_dt9x8g5	0	*	Oh, there are TONS. I have had an internship at a german airport and the amount of specifically U.S. passangers calling staff Nazis is actually not a rarity.
t1_dta20nf	1	*	Because its slander. Europe does not have freedom of speech in the same way america does. you can be prosecuted for slander, harassment and a few other things.
t1_dta04ji	1	*	Imagine if it was the TSA.
t1_dtb74cw	1	*	> youre in someones house, you better respect the rules.  Except not one American thinks it applies to them .
t1_dta2230	0	*	To be fair, any cop will tell you how traffic stops are one of the scariest parts of their job because they can be so dangerous. No one ever died because they were called mean names
t1_dt9x6ai	1	*	 To be fair: insulting a police officer will get you in trouble anywhere on this planet. Although what is taken as an insult worth prosecution  may differ depending on culture. 
t1_dt9vha2	1	*	Lady is definitely a leftist following the liberal movement. 
t1_dtaaih0	1	*	>I wish were exaggerating. I wish I was engaging in hyperbole for humorous effect.  Christ, I wish she was too, but nah she's 100% just like this. 
t1_dtasqjm	0	*	Have a look at her twitter feed, it is ridiculous. She replied to like 100+ tweets that criticised her.  https://twitter.com/cchristinefair?lang=de  It's like she discovered the internet yesterday.
t1_dta5gmp	1	*	I think most of us don't, because there isn't.
t1_dta984b	1	*	She doesn't represent me.
t1_dt9wo42	1	*	There's this quiet weird awkward German kid in my class. He calls himself a Nazi and like says dumb. I can't tell if he's serious or trying to be funny, it's just awkward all the time
t1_dta245f	1	*	Yes, teenagers there are like Hell no, stfu. Never brought it up again.

t1_dta2bl8	0	*	I would have huffed and thrown that deodorant in the trash can and then gone to pout in my seat at the most.

t1_dtac5sw	1	*	..... Why does she have the anti-semetic ((())) around her name?????  Is she using it on herself???  Like, ironically I guess?

t1_dta6y65	1	*	You must not be American? Now days we just call anyone we disagree with a Nazi. It's the go to boogeyman
t1_dta35gg	1	*	But German airport personnel is so much friendlier than the TSA.
t1_dta3wi0	1	*	yeah fuck ohio
t1_dta2lh6	1	*	[it is against the law in Germany](http://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-germany-insult-law-snap-story.html).  Not much more needs to be said.

t1_dta71co	1	*	and Mussolini made the trains run on time.
t1_dta6o53	1	*	To be fair, not all officers are like that. I'm inclined to say that the vast majority are not. Only the few like this get media attention, though.
t1_dtasdhv	1	*	Calling people fascists who aren't really dilutes the power of the word anyways. 
t1_dt9wv1e	1	*	Agreed. Please take her. We dont need her back here in America. 
t1_dt9zbso	0	*	In Russia, if you screw with immigration or security on your way out, they will deliberately keep you waiting until you miss your flight. Shame about the one-way ticket you have to buy to get home.
t1_dta7r4i	1	*	And coming from a country that makes us do this and more harsh stuff for TSA.
t1_dta86bf	0	*	Wow getting in legal trouble for criticising the government certainly proves they are nothing like a facist.
t1_dtarcga	1	*	The fact that they still have to mention this in 2018 is pathetic tho, holy shit
t1_dt9zut9	0	*	Nope. Randomly insulting people is.
t1_dtasp2i	1	*	I mean what did she expect from a bunch of Nazis? You're not in a free country, she should have known not to confront them.
t1_dt9y5mq	1	*	A professor with mental health issues probably. 
t1_dt9zoyo	1	*	Honestly once you're an academic and in the habit of writing every day, the wordcount is going to come out in one form or another, and this is just what happens if you fail to pick a project.
t1_dtaoj8d	1	*	I really wonder how she got that position.
t1_dtatdpm	1	*	It's kind of ironic to be cited for calling the police fascists.
t1_dtbcp9u	1	*	She's a political scientist. Words are not difficult to conjure when you're 20 years into such a career.
t1_dtacbyb	1	*	I wish !redditsilver was still a thing. this comment deserves to be gilded
t1_dta0149	1	*	Austrian here... yeah, neither Germans nor Austrians like it. Most people don't understand what kind of weight that insult has here. I rather be called a incompetent idiot twat and so on than a Nazi. 
t1_dt9y3xf	0	*	They know, but why should they care? Foreign country, foreign law.  Ignorantia legis non excusat.
t1_dta2zt6	1	*	Im going out on a limb and say, not a very good one.

t1_dta0gtq	1	*	Nazis really really hate being called Nazis
t1_dtalpuu	0	*	We don't really have precedents in our law, every case gets judged independently.
t1_dtah4je	0	*	Says the guy who probably never left his country..
t1_dtc49r3	1	*	But this is criticism of Nazism. The implication of calling the cops nazi's is that being a nazi is a bad thing. 
t1_dta4qm9	1	*	Phd in gender studies btw
t1_dt9x67x	1	*	Good boy
t1_dtajx8p	1	*	Even if that is true, she'd be in exactly the same situation, she still called someone a Nazi, in Germany, in public, in front of a police officer.  That's possibly the funniest part about all this.
t1_dta67g0	1	*	It's even worse, they tried to help her.
t1_dta0m30	1	*	> I still consider dropping a couple bucks on a new stick of deodorant a fair alternative to making a scene with thickheaded airport security.  You're not alone, most people do this as well. 
t1_dta4n50	1	*	Sounds like Umbrage.
t1_dta72xr	1	*	Years from now some European is going to call me a Trumpite and I'm going to be PISSED. 
t1_dtaksoz	1	*	Yup. That she insulted someone else proclaiming he looked like a Hitler Youth (despite this part of the story hard to swallow)....that this was extremely shitty didn't even cross her mind.
t1_dta6gku	1	*	Lets make it clear. Freedom of speech does not exist in Germany.
t1_dt9vefy	0	*	> If they piss you off, write a nasty letter from home.  Oh she did that too.
t1_dta5ll9	1	*	Germany doesn't have Free Speech.
t1_dt9zvkr	1	*	People should. 
t1_dtaf7p4	1	*	Well she shows great respect to other fellow humans, especially nazi indian german security officers who stole her deo. 
t1_dta76h2	0	*	Her point is that the deodorant is not a liquid.   She may be an entitled impatient bitch but i want to know is the deodorant a liquid?  She posted it and in my mind it's not. 
t1_dta6x56	1	*	at least she did not get shoot.
t1_dt9xyzd	1	*	>Second to the Jewish people, of course.  Well... yeah...
t1_dta4qzt	1	*	I am not surprised. The word Nazi has been way overused lately and I worry many have forgotten what it truly means to have been a Nazi.
t1_dta0brc	1	*	What?
t1_dta9zqc	1	*	One who knows they're guilty as sin
t1_dta1plu	1	*	>But both really don't like being called Nazis  They're really Nazi's about not being called Nazi.  Especially the Stasi, er, I mean, German Police. 
t1_dta1f0z	1	*	Ha!  Im going to guess that she suffers from TDS. 
t1_dtafe9m	1	*	this entire thing seems like a massive troll to me tbh
t1_dta020z	0	*	I have a bad day at least once a week as I'm sure you do as well. Do you start hurling insults at people just doing their jobs?

t1_dt9vay5	0	*	>Silly woman is just showing her own ignorance of what the word actually implies.  Ahh yes, silly woman needs to brush up on her vocabulary. Better fine her, boys.
t1_dtbb3fo	1	*	Ugh, that article is littered with spelling and grammatical errors. 
t1_dt9zhbm	1	*	Maybe they're so against being called Nazi's that they overreact, and end up coming full circle and start acting like Nazi's again, just in the name of being Anti-Nazi.
t1_dtadvun	1	*	I encounter people like this each and every day.  They blow their tops for the slightest thing.  She could've just chucked the damn deodorant, got on her plane and shut up.
t1_dtakglj	0	*	Lord Christ, Bavarian cops. I am surprised. These guys usually don't eff around. Seriously.
t1_dt9zpur	1	*	Americans are a hyperbolic bunch unfortunately hyperboles, sarcasm, and idioms rarely translate well

t1_dt9vtag	0	*	... You guys literally had a white power rally with Nazi swastika flags and there was a wave of literal rape allegations in Hollywood. How are you surprised that people were called Nazis and rapists?

t1_dusflcy	1	*	This, and only this.

t1_dur4q35	1	*	Damn, this guy exorcises   (btw witchers usually kill off possessed by demons)

t1_dunybin	1	*	No, this stopping of the issuing merely will translate out as the women will be persecuted and killed more than likely. The House of Saud just wants to wash their hands of it I think.

t1_duophcd	0	*	It only makes sense if you consider women  property.
t1_duo9lmh	1	*	No guarantee it wont slide back.

t1_du0rc5i	1	*	Yes

t1_dtvbqtm	0	*	Wasn't he the one with connections to Prince Charles? 
t1_dtvbu9d	1	*	I think times has changed in the West, but only recently, he would have been murdered 10 years ago. Now that would make it very suspicious so safer to defame.  
t1_dulc3i1	1	*	Really? Anybody that mentioned he was a piece of shit or that Israel has enacted apartheid against Palestinians was attacked as anti-Semitic. It works well as a thought-terminating cliche. 
t1_dv2zea5	1	*	It, uh, finds a way.

t1_du7u66a	1	*	Same thing they do to Sino-Solar

t1_dshoiv5	1	*	Nah the settlement expansions must end.    I get accused of shilling for Israel most of the time, but that one is pretty clear.
t1_dsh2hyb	0	*	Watching Israel continue this nonsense is like watching someone walk into an oncoming train. The day that Trump and the Gulf Arab oil emirs disappear... it aint gonna be pretty.
t1_dsh2dnh	0	*	I'm not too sure I agree that Arabs are good at uniting. 
t1_dshi8or	0	*	How many new settlements have Palestinians built this year?  I guess they did that because they dont want peace. Thats how,it works, right?
t1_dsh2erp	0	*	>It will be classic Muslims against Jews.  How often did that happen before Israel?
t1_dsh4g4o	1	*	Ah, there's that mere legitimate criticism of Israel's policies we all know and love...
t1_dshh4nx	0	*	You are right but this is basically Israels tactic, pushing them in a corner so they will accept a peace deal with less (without jerusalem)

t1_duq8dal	0	*	Who on Reddit is saying NRA is being treated unfairly besides /r/the_donald? Most of Reddit is relishing this.
t1_duq6bwv	1	*	Well yeah, why wouldn't they? Typically investigations end when the accused are indicted and charges are formally brought. 
t1_duqc5sl	1	*	True... though probably not the Japanese.

t1_duqjqdd	1	*	The edgiest comedy of all

t1_duq9y8x	0	*	If so, what of it? Of course the US is willing to spend more to ensure the survival of its democracy and institutions than Kreml is to destroy them.
t1_duqa56l	1	*	If this investigation leads to bombshells like this and shows the faults of citizens United....maybe we'll get that chance. 
t1_duq91wq	1	*	Yes, but now jig is up.

t1_duq8rqs	1	*	What?!  Russia isn't ever going to invade, they couldn't.  They can support groups that support their guy.  
t1_duq7x9j	0	*	Well you're partially right, the FBI does investigate what it want to. That's kind of the point.
t1_duqaclp	0	*	To be fair, in the 1800s, nobody would was trying to undermine or repeal the 2nd amendment, so there wasn't a need for an organization like the modern NRA.

t1_duqad81	0	*	Am I allowed to think my fellow, pro-NRA Americans are shitty and also blame Russia for influencing our election?
t1_duqhlol	1	*	This is a big reason why I wanted him in office. He's someone that we can garner enough support to impeach and bring attention to the amount of shit that's in the crockpot.

t1_dt75wae	0	*	Brewed in the EU  We're off the hook.

t1_dsla1zk	1	*	2. Calling the police and claiming you have a weapon and will hurt others while pretending to be someone else seems common sense  3. He posted afterwards about it, I think they will get him.

t1_dskp3xc	1	*	And ripple has the comparable market cap. Cryptobubble will end so badly.
t1_dskr1a5	1	*	In other word, random anonymous guy on the internet expresses his opinion that the elected Mayor of London's opinion is worthless.
t1_dskoy5x	1	*	I mean, almost 57% voted for him, so a majority who voted do.
t1_dskqcno	0	*	He didnt say that.

t1_dskrtkf	1	*	Sad(iq)!
t1_dskn5bg	1	*	It's either this topic or the other about the same topic, there's a highly upvoted post about how USA is such a shit hole they moved to Mexico. Because somehow the standard of living is better there. 
t1_dskxij2	1	*	That gives him at least as much legitimacy as Trump, though.
t1_dskog58	1	*	Its embarrassing. 
t1_dsknrh7	1	*	Why would we deal with the mayor of London?
t1_dsksnkz	1	*	U mean trashing your neiborohood? 
t1_dsky5cc	1	*	The mayor of London does not speak for everyone, this is a little man who got elected because he was a Muslim

t1_dskohvz	1	*	Haha just like America, imported a bunch of white dudes, no surprise that they immediately ruined the lives of the people livin there. Damn foreigners

t1_dskm55n	1	*	Um...
t1_dskqvfm	1	*	No, you have a mayor making political comment about the city he is mayor for. He's had bugger all to do with Trump not coming.
t1_dskl691	0	*	Let me guess, You support him blindly
t1_dskmbl9	0	*	Strange how nobody notices that America is actually doing pretty well under his presidency so far.

t1_dsklvdf	1	*	Maybe we can send him to Russia? I have a feeling that they'd make him feel at home.
t1_dskohw2	1	*	You gonna keep intentionally misinterpreting what he said?   And yes, the people of London do want him in London, that's why they elected him and gave him a majority.
t1_dskny4m	1	*	Good old cognitive dissonance.

t1_dsycxkj	1	*	I like how the other people making comments on this got downvotes but the trump fans somehow missed you. Maybe they saw US citizens followed by trumpiola?

t1_dt45g43	0	*	UN Chief calls it a bad idea for the world. The USs actions affect the rest of the world 
t1_dt4w64b	0	*	Did you also pitch a fit when [Obama and the Democrats did the same thing?](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/17/business/energy-environment/-us-imposes-steep-tariffs-on-chinese-solar-panels.html)
t1_dt4zcij	0	*	These tarrifs are inline with most of europes tarrifs on china.  Are euopeans also protecting oil and coal?
t1_dt48o0k	0	*	Because he is.  He wrecked solar installation jobs, which massively overshadows solar production in the US.  
t1_dt46e8s	0	*	> Could the UN sanction the USA for speeding up the effects of climate change?  The US would veto it and even if they could somehow get past that, they wouldn't be able to enforce it.

t1_dsvj4kw	1	*	The people who are in it for a free ride are the ones that screw it up for the people who actually need it.
t1_du2iuah	1	*	OK I chuckled
t1_du1kur1	0	*	Shut your american ass up, dont talk about north korea like that.
t1_dt7ix9w	1	*	Yes, title is not accurate. They meant those 2 regions where directly touching.

t1_dv011zc	0	*	Absolutely, must keep the pool clean in the middle of a bloody civil war. Standards must be maintained!!

t1_dtg9lh2	0	*	Yes, I suppose you could choose to live in a fantasy world where those who do this type of thing aren't human.
t1_dsxah7l	1	*	Theyre not tenants, theyre lease holders who own the apartments.
t1_dsx1n4p	0	*	Except all the tenants are in fact for all practical purposes owner occupiers and the landlord is really just a joint management company.

t1_dtir4pu	0	*	And?  It's great news nonetheless. A government actually fullfilled their promises. Overdelivered  even.  In a country with such a big population, its going to make a real impact.
t1_dtigzvg	1	*	If they're moving away from coal then they need new solar farms to replace them.

t1_dtk5qkq	1	*	You fund Israel
t1_dtkz4in	1	*	Thats funny. There are multiple levels of crime happening in two branches of the US government and most of the populace is pretty okay with just sitting by idly and letting it happen.
t1_dt052ac	0	*	Did you even read the article before commenting.   She was interviewed at an airport .. like thousands of other people.   This woman has some serioua insecurities

t1_dscro48	1	*	Thats not worth noting nor correlate-able to this Foxconn situation at all. 
t1_dsde4n9	1	*	Thou deserve absolute despair.  
t1_dscok8u	0	*	That still doesn't excuse their sweatshop conditions
t1_dscq33a	1	*	Foxconn has an entire campus of buildings in Shenzen and almost all of them have nets about the ground floor to prevent people from killing themselves on company grounds. 
t1_dsd1d9s	1	*	Stop trying to diffuse the pitchforks with your facts and reasoning thx
t1_dscpazg	1	*	Source?
t1_dsd6blc	1	*	That's what bender was trying to do in the first episode of futurama

t1_dscpc4z	1	*	That's a giant factory,  it has to be the size of a small city
t1_dsc9rea	0	*	Not only that, but it would be good PR for Apple as well since the slow down shenanigans made them look shifty recently. 
t1_dsd36gp	1	*	So mental health and a variety of other complex factors?
t1_dsd5hrk	0	*	this worker is much-o broken-o 
t1_dscxk76	1	*	Foxconn is already working on it in Wisconsin.
t1_dsczb3z	1	*	Foxconn makes a ton of electronics from many many brands the title just put Apple for clicks.   Good luck
t1_dscumtz	1	*	You can't compare general population suicide rate to workplace related suicide rate lmao. 
t1_dscxask	1	*	300,000 people looking for work are capable of many things far worse than suicide.
t1_dscrjdn	0	*	It's almost like the luxuries of being the gold standard come with some downsides!
t1_dsdu56o	1	*	Yes but will they intentionally slow down the older robots to save a batteries life once the newer robots come out?  #BatteryLivesMatter
t1_dsd8330	1	*	The original article may have been written in Chinese and translated. Google is much better at translating Spanish or French to English than it is Chinese or Japanese 
t1_dsd0c9r	1	*	man, every time I hear about Shenzen it's about bad working conditions. I know that's to be expected with an industrial area but man, it sucks.
t1_dsd4ika	1	*	Maybe because they have suicide preventions, such as barred windows.
t1_dsd1fin	1	*	The working conditions there compared to other factories in Shenzhen and Guangzhou are 'good'. We only know about this happenings at Foxconn because they make our precious iphones.
t1_dscr1c2	1	*	I guess you've never heard of Bender and his suicide booth?
t1_dscr7l9	1	*	I mean that just makes sense. Cornell is sending its graduates to low-end companies like Dunder Mifflin, it's no surprise that the general outlook isn't too great.
t1_dscrlxf	1	*	Just wait till they start making suicide booths.  /s.
t1_dsdr7xu	0	*	Bet it was taken down since it was a really bad thing to have up.
t1_dsd1gvx	1	*	Get out of here with those facts. This is reddit.
t1_dscs3as	0	*	I have the same issue when people try to drag me into the veteran suicide crisis.  Veteran suicide rate is quite low compared to any comparable control group.  
t1_dscrdd8	1	*	You mean the factories? I think it's their choice to work there. There are so many people in China, you would just take any job you can get. 
t1_dsd9ar9	1	*	Great thing. They'll just commit suicide because they have no money for food.
t1_dscpziv	1	*	They might, they havent worked at Foxconn yet
t1_dscycvs	1	*	Good luck with that. Unless you want to stop using every electronic device.
t1_dsc9s75	0	*	Homocide? We're talking about suicide here not killing gay people.
t1_dsd1yup	1	*	Exhibit A on why people should do some critical thinking and research before coming to certain conclusions based on the news. 
t1_dscxnuc	1	*	Foxconn is a high technology factory, it is not a sweatshop and conditions are pretty good there. As others ITT have mentioned, the suicide rate at foxconn is lower than the US national average. 
t1_dsd6es7	1	*	The Cleveland Browns locker room?
t1_dsco9xl	1	*	the daily turdigraph dont actually care about lives, they just want to make a political point
t1_dscvkwu	1	*	That's mostly because at Foxconn they have a suicide net
t1_dscpyqd	1	*	Ohh fuck, that is alot.
t1_dscxiu9	0	*	Yeah then these workers can return to a hand to mouth existence as farmers with no hopes of improving their lot. Excellent solution sir!
t1_dscqnsp	0	*	So no concern about executive pay, just whether better working conditions will make your phone more expensive? 
t1_dscs9ev	1	*	That was not a true story, it was retracted as a lie.
t1_dscc1bv	0	*	Implying they care about anything other than the cost of production (well maybe a little bit about the bad PR).
t1_dscra7r	0	*	Yeah but presumably people aren't living at the factories.
t1_dscs3gl	1	*	This isn't a grammatical error. So...yeah... .
t1_dsd1sft	1	*	You speak the truth.
t1_dscx9yw	1	*	What?
t1_dscsxhq	1	*	I guess the anti-suicide nets must be working!
t1_dscroj7	1	*	You must not have gotten very far in your research, they have pretty much the best record in the region. 
t1_dskz1gy	0	*	To live in a country that has no tension between different ethnic people? Why not? 
t1_dsb1fb2	0	*	Do you think they'd read Proust and duscuss medieval philosophy if it weren't for Facebook? 
t1_dsacdzy	1	*	Lol, that's the stupidest analogy I've seen so far in this debate.
t1_dsb1dtf	1	*	Bingo more and more people now get to realize when there is no repercussions that a good chunk of people are actually just terrible. 
t1_dsacnz3	1	*	I was going to type the same thing 
t1_dsa4ru3	1	*	I was thinking I'm going insane, thanks for confirming this.
t1_dsafht3	1	*	I think it's much more complicated than that, but don't let me get between a man and his axe-to-grind. 
t1_dsa5a49	0	*	> and is encouraging girls as young as 9 to have multiple boyfriends at once  Wut.  Sounds like you've seen a couple of examples of something happening and extrapolated that it's the norm.
t1_dsa6i0r	1	*	Right... disillusionment.
t1_dsajzgb	1	*	Meanwhile on Reddit lol
t1_dsap3n5	0	*	Reddit is about sharing ideas, Facebook is about posting stupid memes and photos of things nobody cares about!, Facebook is 34 times worse!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
t1_dsa9ocs	1	*	Yes, like Reddit.
t1_dsbjmm4	1	*	How many times are you going to pointlessly complain and cry about it, something that cannot and will not ever affect reposting in the slightest. 
t1_dsap7e4	1	*	And Mark Zuckerbeng is the leader of them!!!!!
t1_dsavfpw	1	*	Inb4 the army of Redditors arrives with their elaborate explanations as to how Reddit is *sooo* different from Facebook and Twitter and is therefore not social media.
t1_dsafbvv	1	*	You must be like, really smart.
t1_dsa44hg	0	*	Well according to your comment, nobody has a right to an opinion on any subject unless they have a degree in that subject. Get in the fucking sea.

t1_dsreap2	0	*	you mean analysis' that have been done by different european organizations in the dozen?
t1_dsrfur1	1	*	At least with the Germans in charge things will get done for once, rather than the inept flailing and deflecting the Tories are getting up to these days.
t1_dswqv6e	1	*	It's not that. It's infrastructure. SA has spectacularly failed because their ruling class doesn't give a fuck 
t1_dswui5w	1	*	They probably could, but I'm pretty sure Zuma used that money on his private residences.
t1_dswq0um	1	*	Canada here. Been saying this for about 10 years now. You ever wonder why corporations like Nestle are behind buying access to water sources and why there's a run up on water stocks... U0001f914
t1_dsx67t2	0	*	Yeah man Imagine that. Although nuclear equipment was stolen by foreign agents apparently at Palindaba back in 07
t1_dsxtrnp	1	*	There's a drought in the Western Cape so the dams haven't been replenishing. 
t1_dsx693i	1	*	It's not fertility, it's planned migration from the Eastern Cape to win political power. 
t1_dsw7jhp	0	*	California?
t1_dswt8kp	0	*	That's pretty evil

t1_dua53ym	1	*	Yeah it exists. I even watched a documentary when this person called the Taliban on a cellphone. It was kinda bizzare
t1_dua486l	1	*	We've been following your strategy since 2001. Hasn't exactly worked out.
t1_du8mpmv	0	*	Actually, looking at how your head of government seems to eat up praise even if undeserved... I'd say they know America a little too well!
t1_dtklh8f	1	*	We've been there or thereabouts for years, though, can't remember it being any different and I'm a late 20s adult 
t1_dt21bg2	1	*	I've been an iPhone user since the 4 and the lack of home button on the X makes it 100x better. Navigation and multitasking is so much faster.

t1_dtf4rz9	1	*	Putin has won with 53%, 70%, and 63%. People in Russia actually like him O_o

t1_dto9adl	0	*	You should see the regime shills over at /r/syriancivilwar when it happens.  The next Israeli warplane violating Syrian airspace will be shot down by the SAA guys, for real this time!

t1_durpx5t	1	*	And chemistry

t1_dtbqawm	0	*	Oh the humanity!
t1_dto4ncz	1	*	Too bad they don't transition away from most taxes and over time just tax real estate. That can't run away or evade taxes.
t1_du3vaio	0	*	Well you certainly dont sound biased/s
t1_dujdde5	1	*	Doesn't matter whether they have a right to be there, point of this article is that these backwards people are denying women equal rights
t1_dss29wn	0	*	Are you stockpiling some fresh water?   I live in the U.S. Southwest, and it's generally a good idea every summer, let alone when we're facing severe drought. 
t1_dt6p5pz	1	*	Actually there is no link between fighting terrorist organizations and being bad authoritarian. All countries has right to defend its borders from terrorist organizations like PKK, PYD/YPG or ISIS.

t1_durrzbc	1	*	I believe the lack of affordable housing is what increases homeless population. But I could be wrong.
t1_durp7pa	0	*	Who cares
t1_durpnsd	1	*	That because the booze is carded. In legal states the weed is now carded as well so good luck with that.
t1_durptqm	0	*	Tax revenue from cannabis really should appeal to conservatives more
t1_durdy2q	1	*	Fellow Washingtonian, can confirm!
t1_durdkth	1	*	Really good to know!!
t1_duru1ap	1	*	WA has an interesting problem...too much weed. Wholesale prices are hovering around $1/gram. SWIM just bought a QP this morning of top shelf Jack OG for 250. 
t1_durq0rc	1	*	I'd like to think this but it sure the fuck didn't work with the boomers.

t1_ds35r2t	1	*	Do we really need any documentation to prove that the only reason NK exists in the first place is the presence of the US in the region?
t1_duqxicu	1	*	Spend it all. Then make more. 
t1_dur22ii	1	*	It doesn't work that way. Multiply or divide Trump, and it never gets to good, using positive numbers.

t1_duqyvm2	0	*	Nigeria won't be debt free?
t1_dur22xf	1	*	No, theyre rewarding positive steps towards better healthcare. The debt theyre paying is there because Nigeria wanted to increase vaccinations. 
t1_dur0ggt	1	*	Ah yes, the good old reverse Nigerian scam where you give 76 millions instead of receiving it.
t1_dur3exx	0	*	Interesting but surely Japan still take on the credit risk here? I guess they bet that the government would invest it in the right things and it paid off in the end.

t1_dtamcpf	0	*	Isn't dairy products like quark better than meat if you want proteins?
t1_dtu59wy	0	*	> Youve really got to be looking for an issue to do something as precious as this.  Kind of cuts both ways, doesn't it?
t1_dunxkqd	1	*	It's equally amazing how many people are swayed by a highly upvoted comment.

t1_dufzhuq	0	*	Your geography is incorrect. 
t1_duzpypm	1	*	Get hyped for them in Russian then.
t1_duyphyh	1	*	I just hope it's a comedy. 
t1_duyj42p	1	*	The room Trump stayed in had been previously used by the Obamas. The prostitutes peed on the bed because Obama had slept in it. It's an extremely childish way to get back at Obama by Trump. 
t1_duyjru6	1	*	Sounds like a great start to an interesting fictional thriller. 
t1_duys03l	0	*	Is this a pasta? If not it needs to be. 
t1_duzdx9l	1	*	Reason is already winning out. Hence the investigation. It is so blatant now that even Russia-bots are becoming a non-factor.
t1_duyza5t	1	*	Prediction: this shit is going to drag on for three years, nobody important ever going to go to jail, and of story. Nice democracy you got there.

t1_duyodnw	1	*	And asparagus....?
t1_duyzoct	1	*	Those comments are fantastic!

t1_duyjoyh	0	*	If you call out Russian accounts and blow their cover they will rage quit. 
t1_duyj56g	1	*	These comments confuse me.  Is there some version of this idiom where the straws being grasped are all connected to criminal indictments and guilty pleas?
t1_duys3w0	0	*	This has been the theory from the very beginning.
t1_duytu3h	1	*	You realize it took years to bring down Nixon, right? And we are just over a year in
t1_duyy1e1	1	*	Reddit somehow believes that Trump is mentally retarded yet also capable of pulling off a decades long, world wide conspiracy to attain the presidency. 
t1_duyp0t1	1	*	Because the trail of  his crimes extends that far back. 
t1_duyltzv	1	*	Yup. A good prosecutor doesn't ask questions that he doesn't already know the answers.  
t1_duyz1zj	1	*	Somebody like Muller would most likely have a dead mans switch for such a situation.  At least I hope.
t1_duyizou	1	*	Trump is noted for being a cleanophile and for hating Barack Obama. There would be few things more insulting to him than having a hooker urinate in the Obamas' bed. 
t1_duyqt7j	1	*	I'm ok with the Voter ID thing but we need to look at how they influenced the public and the election. 
t1_duz0hcz	1	*	The Obamas stayed in a hotel room. Some time later, Trump booked the same hotel room. Gifted with prostitutes, he instructed them to pee on the bed because Obama had slept in it.
t1_duzlkq6	1	*	I heard some jimmies rustle.
t1_dv0fbhz	1	*	If you look at the Steele memo, as well as known evidence, this is the deal that could put Trump away for money laundering.
t1_duz5sig	1	*	Can he delete all tweets before becoming president and it would be okay? Or Twitter had backups of everything so it doesn't matter?
t1_duylxoa	1	*	The Clinton Benghazi investigations?
t1_duyxrh7	1	*	The pee tape is the least of his worries. He has been doing back room deals with Russians since he 80's. He would have gotten away with all of it if his stupid ego didn't make him run for president.
t1_duynfq0	0	*	I wonder if Trump killed a hooker
t1_duyita9	1	*	Yea, all those people who have been charged and plead guilty just did it for funnsies. You're the joke. Go back to playing with your action figures.

t1_dv57rff	1	*	Did you just learn of the journalistic practice of allowing sources to remain anonymous when the source cannot reveal their identity because of the risk of retaliation?
t1_dv54sx2	1	*	I keep saying, if Trump hadn't run for president (and won on top of that), he could have kept his shady dealings.
t1_dv4wsxm	1	*	Few things are as sacred as the division between business and . . . oh wait we're not doing that anymore? My bad, carry on.

t1_dv4w2s9	1	*	Nail hit on head... In health scratch scratch scratch 
t1_dv4um0c	1	*	When that much money is at stake, you're willing to risk it. He got caught and should be arrested. Even trump knows the guy is wrong. 
t1_dv4sjf6	1	*	really? you can't? you're a fucking idiot. 
t1_dv53605	0	*	He's supposed to not create even the appearance of conflict of interest. That could be achieved in a few ways, including recusing himself from decisions where a conflict appears.
t1_dv4qbpg	1	*	Hopefully no one else is so stupidly superstitious. We know these people are evil fucks. We dont need an artificial omen to underscore that fact. 
t1_dv4wobv	1	*	Not until we excise the GOP cancer in November.

t1_dv52k26	1	*	Literally everything Hillary has done fucking *Trump* has done...only *worse*.  And unsurprisingly he's filled his administration with people like him.

t1_dv5dm0f	1	*	Even /pol/ warned Trump's team about Kushner very early on. 
t1_dv4utdm	1	*	But if youre born into immense wealth and privilege, spoiled, and not particularly intelligent - then you dont understand & dont care that youre on a different stage. 
t1_dv59aml	1	*	If Hillary's not indicted for using a private email account, can you indict Kushner for doing it? Something to ponder about.

t1_dv4tsei	1	*	Well he thought daddy in law was gonna take most of the attention away from him. He thought wrong 
t1_dv570id	1	*	Like awarding contracts to countries while your spouse is getting paid to make short speeches in those very countries?
t1_dv4svsv	1	*	And if Kushner was making money off of them he'd be fine with that. Hence why political decisions shouldn't be based off who will loan him money. 
t1_dv4yeb1	0	*	When you get the fire lit to prosecute Hillary for ALL of it, Ill get behind the Kushner prosecution. Until then, MAGA. 
t1_dv4zy85	1	*	Nothing new. We all know how much dick Cheney profited from the war in Iraq because of his financial stake in Halliburton. Doesnt make it right... but nothing new.

t1_dv4ytad	1	*	Republicans collectively agreed not to do anything about it. Thats how they know theyre family  They dont care if they are caught if theres no punishment.
t1_dv4wjlc	1	*	To be fair, nothing has come of it so far for any of the other ridiculous things occurring. If I were him I might just say screw it too and see how far I could push the envelope. 
t1_dv4xxzg	1	*	Then you think about everything that they have gotten away with so far, and you wonder why he wouldn't do it. There are no repercussions for Trump and his family.

t1_dtz7f9t	0	*	You mean Frankfurt.
t1_dtznpnc	0	*	The right in Britain are to blame. The sane people in America didn't want Trump as president yet here we are. I'm not too surprised this cancer persists with our friends overseas.

t1_dtzi70u	1	*	> They won't get it, the UK will loose thousands of jobs.  Well, the EU is more than happy to offer those terms  if the UK stays in the Common Market, which also requires free movement of workers...
t1_dtzhl6c	1	*	If the corporations were in control they wouldn't have allowed Brexit. They are just responding to economic incentives in a rational way.

t1_dsfmedl	1	*	What if that were someones intent?
t1_dsfjw3e	1	*	Yeah but fuck Trump though. The more bad press he gets the happier I am. 
t1_dsfi9zs	1	*	I hate the Cheeto as much as anyone else, but other countries are imprisoning and killing journalists.
t1_dsff6kl	1	*	I think that was going to be the top story, until Trump found out he was going to be ranked #2.  
t1_dsfhwwo	1	*	But huff is fake news because their writers are brain dead and dont know what they are talking about. 
t1_dsfdgl0	0	*	Are you stupid or a troll?

t1_dspcdxx	1	*	Na. Then we just go to Dark Forest Deterrence instead of MAD. That is if they don't overwhelm us first.
t1_dsp1loe	1	*	This is the equivalent of leaking a dick pick when you are hung like a babys arm.
t1_dsp5os9	0	*	> If only all this energy could be easily harnessed.   We have nuclear power plants...
t1_dsp33xp	0	*	But what can you do when in charge of this? Dismantle your own nuclear weapons hoping the enemy to do the same? Then start a conventional weapons world-war because there's no MAD?

t1_dsp42ye	1	*	Capable of carrying means the upper threshold capability is a 100MT warhead. Much more likely to be carrying a ~10MT tactical warhead. 
t1_dsozt22	1	*	There's no way you're putting a 100MT warhead on a submarine launched drone.

t1_dspe7tu	1	*	As a matter of fact - oil prices were going up ever since the beginning of 2016. Not that is changes much to your statement.
t1_dsoi6d3	0	*	Good way to take out an entire harbor.  This is just a natural progression from nuclear tipped torpedoes anyway.
t1_dsp8881	1	*	Why would it be?

t1_dsp9g1k	1	*	>How is it all of a sudden cold war fears all over again?  It isn't.
t1_dsps3p7	1	*	Never saw it, then again I don't watch penis measuring vids on YouTube as much..
t1_dsp33gq	1	*	You've got some chance to shoot a nuke out of the sky.  This drone on the other hand is totally unseen until it detonates.  It would be tough to detect and destroy something like this.
t1_dspuv1h	1	*	I definitely read about this like a year ago.
t1_dsoix83	0	*	Death hand is a myth 
t1_dsp689e	1	*	Because media is so prevalent in society and they prey on fear
t1_dsp3u33	1	*	You either wait for another warhead to go off and hit the goodbye Earth button or you sample the fallout to find out who made the thing and have congress declare all out war on them.

t1_dsrq9ze	1	*	A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.  Someone said that once, and no matter how much people hate that person she wasn't wrong.

t1_dsrvj7z	1	*	Nobody is disputing that. If Kim said water is wet, I'm not gunna disagree just because I don't like the guy. I don't see your point.
t1_dsstxd9	1	*	You just said it: we have come down to their level. Trump rhetoric and tweets validate their insults and provocations. The are being provoked now.

t1_dss6ton	1	*	That's what we call a community event.
t1_dsrp46k	0	*	This event is completely unverified.  There's plenty to criticise about North Korea, so how about we stick to known, verified information.
t1_dss0gco	1	*	They probably just took some time to craft an appropriate political response, rather than just gabbing off shit on twitter.
t1_dsrpad7	1	*	They are both way to out of shape for that and besides that Trump's got debilitating bone spurs that don't bother him on the golf course.
t1_dssdrmz	1	*	Even a broken clock gives the right time twice a day. It took the dumbest president in history to make Kim right.

t1_dskyo5k	1	*	Oh, you're gonna ask if it's ok to move there first? Why not just move there illegally?
t1_dsl2ycr	1	*	One reason we have Trump is because Hillary Clinton was unelectable, and she was the alternative that the Democratic Party offered. For many people, Trump was the lesser of two evils.

t1_dtvaahh	0	*	No, they don't. But lets not pretend Putin is releasing all of his income here.
t1_dtvfo84	0	*	Yeah, not really only 3 or 4 out of the 45.
t1_dtyg8wx	0	*	He believes it's not a result of human activity, against all evidence to the contrary.
t1_dtz6nps	1	*	I am sure we are living in an historical time.
t1_dtypmtw	1	*	Half of us are. The other half is like Fuck yeah, we're Red Team because red team kicks ass! Cry moar libruls!!!
t1_dtyhxhp	1	*	As in all things, rich rarely translates to good.
t1_dty4d6j	1	*	I'm blaming Putin. 
t1_dtz9jzl	1	*	What century of progress was that?
t1_du05azs	0	*	The climate has indeed been kind to us up til now, that's why we don't want to screw it up with our carbon emissions.
t1_dus0lix	1	*	Loooool
t1_dusgeqo	1	*	> flying near 2 SU-27s.  It was either Su-30, or Su-35
t1_dursrbh	1	*	Lol, what? You didn't think Israel had satellites? 
t1_duwmpzd	0	*	Maybe the author wanted to be clever because while outdated in British English, the word Furore is a completely normal word here in Germany and describes the outrage on all sides pretty well. 
t1_duwn7k4	1	*	>The only other way would be getting security,   A food bank in Crivitz, Germany actually had police protection in 2016 because the situation was out of control.
t1_dsiitua	0	*	^ That's what propaganda done right looks like. You make people feel enpowered, intelligent and morally superior, almost as if they are making decisions out of their own free will LUL
t1_dui4bx6	1	*	As far as I know those drugs help more than they hurt. So it's not a great problem. It's not like all those people are braindead zombies.
t1_dtkpk89	1	*	> despite never being featured in the doping scandals  I don't think that should really matter. The country had a state-run doping program. The punishment should cover all Russian athletes.
t1_dtkyzh9	1	*	haha yeah, all of a sudden reddit is *really* defensive of poor 'ol Russia. 
t1_dtkuy3x	1	*	this is sooooo sad, Viktor An is the best of the best and he was banned ((

t1_dsyhl7h	0	*	So do US antitrust laws not have sway in Puerto Rico?
t1_dsynfj6	0	*	I don't think trump can be blamed for this. 
t1_ds7et4k	1	*	It's a pretty back handed comment but you beat me to it.
t1_dsfarya	1	*	yes, but i think they're taking it as a literal dollar sense regardless of inflation.  I disagree with their statement as well, but I understand how they can sensationalize a title like that.
t1_dszokk0	0	*	They are organizing voter registration, and signing up to run for office everywhere they can.  https://www.emilyslist.org/news/entry/11000-women-interested-in-running-for-office-glamour
t1_dszlbg4	1	*	Anti-trump and pro #metoo.  So yes.  Its the social(-ist) event of the season!
t1_dtnxk76	0	*	Not exactly the same thing, but have you seen r/subredditsimulator?
t1_dtobhy3	1	*	Thank God, it wasn't just my brain that immediately went there. 
t1_dto2r5e	0	*	Perfect sell. Downloaded.
t1_dtn9d6x	1	*	Lasers! Why did there have to be lasers!? -Archeologists probably
t1_dto0csd	1	*	They (or someone else) probably has been already 
t1_dtnw1fg	1	*	THis is such fake news dude... you think these people couldn't find the ruins in guatemala?! That's fucking nuts.
t1_dtn9fjg	0	*	Ushering in the golden age of artifact theft and revisionist history by white people! 
t1_duwb8wt	0	*	About 500 years of tradition in Jerusalem could be a reason? I heard they had tax exempt since 16th centuries there.
t1_dsfccxz	1	*	They are, but the government made illegal the use of cryptocurrency. Heck, Runescape currency is more valuable than the Bolivar right now.
t1_ds1199j	1	*	It's not 2018 until it's 2018 in the modern day Rome.
t1_dsr1g8p	0	*	They were bought for a dollar by a Russian Billionaire and moved everything online.  Their goal is to get clicks. 
t1_dsre0x5	0	*	Well that doesnt look good for the landlord. Hope there is enough proof for justice. I cant think of a reason to not let engineers in over such a risk. Must be a money thing but still..
t1_dupfkzk	1	*	Mostly true I think, but money is not the the only thing, power (military, political or influence) is the true key to understand these situations in my opinion
t1_duq3oj7	1	*	Why dont you do it yourself
t1_dupzf3j	1	*	Technically yes.  But most of the time that just means sanctions, expelling diplomats, trade penalties, etc.  Unfortunately.   
t1_duq248m	1	*	South Sudan is a Christian country and these are Christians doing this to themselves btw, fyi 
t1_duqukn9	1	*	It is a factory. Processed. Systematic
t1_duq2p00	0	*	Such as? Send western soldiers in? Which will be sarcastically derided as occupation for the oil? 
t1_dupz2r6	1	*	But they said heavy pseudo-colonial involvement of  foreign western powers was good for Africa! ^(/s)
t1_dtwa79f	1	*	Don't worry about it too much Asahi owns quite a bit.
t1_dtd2y74	1	*	If be more worried about whether or not they have all the parts for it. 
t1_dse3y8p	1	*	he says unironically
t1_dsdoxj6	0	*	Exactly, we are teaching the children there to fear the sky and apparently can't foresee the effect that's going to have in another few years.
t1_dsdvvbb	1	*	Yes this started the hate....
t1_dslfiv5	0	*	If we boycott Tim hortons where the fuck are we going to get coffee? Our productivity as a nation would plummet. GDP will crash. No can Do, neighbourino. 
t1_duo6wer	1	*	I so hope you're right. OTOH, our country was charmed by a snake.
t1_duo3tfv	1	*	Penile Manor
t1_dsd1095	0	*	Huh? They never campaigned to leave the EU.
t1_dt030az	0	*	 Stalinist terrorist group  Im embarassed for you. Who do you think we are?  AKP voters?
t1_dt03qm4	1	*	I wonder if Turkey pays people to deflect the way China does.
t1_dt02rwd	0	*	> Why aren't US and allied planes shooting them down. Aren't the Kurds supposed to be our allies in fighting Isis and in stabilising the region.  You'd think so, given the definition of ally, but no.
t1_dtddccl	1	*	Autocrats are the original snowflakes. They can't handle criticism or opposition no matter how inconsequential or unlikely it is to actually disrupt their plans.
t1_dswpz6f	1	*	Because normal people stay away from crazy people
t1_dswqkn1	0	*	I'm sure Jesus wouldn't make that list.
t1_dtepoka	1	*	I'm in no way liberal or Labor but fuck if it was not the best thing I did unsubbing from that... 
t1_dtfvkcb	0	*	...firearms are not banned in Australia, it is just difficult to get your hands on a gun.
t1_dtfbzdg	0	*	Trying to build/maintain an economy that amounts to anything other than dogging up rocks, is neoconservatism?
t1_du5reib	1	*	https://vimeo.com/75999839
t1_dtkjpc2	1	*	Careful now; you'll end up with something like  > Let's keep our land glorious and free! 
t1_dtkh9w1	0	*	I wasn't aware that it was either achieve world peace and cure disease or change the anthem, and the government decided to change the anthem. That's crazy.
t1_dui4yui	1	*	A trip to walmart confirms theyre better looking than us lol
t1_duic4cq	0	*	I find it hilarious that it hasn't occurred to you that our descendants will likely think the same of us.
t1_duhy9zi	1	*	No, no, it's a sex manual for people who are 300 years old.  The witchcraft comes in with the whole 'being dead' thing.  
t1_dui8yoz	0	*	Yea after working so hard to eliminate superstition from the public you're just shooting yourself in the foot by reintroducing it.
t1_duhopdw	0	*	Page after page of anal euphemisms. 
t1_du0h7hb	1	*	True. But the radio show i was listening to had already used yhis data to manipulate its listeners. He argued that its because of Ontarios's rise in minimum wage that this happened.
t1_dujadmn	1	*	BDS supporting morons need to basically boycott modern life, as any list should include computers and quite a lot of software.  Ah, but it's easier to boycott stuff that doesn't harm your comfort, eh?
t1_dunid8o	0	*	Wow what a well thought out and insightful prediction, and in the 'inb4' meme format we've all come to know and love.
t1_dum43b4	1	*	PS America, some of us are totally ok with you guys sending freedom here.   
t1_dulx5dn	1	*	Trump, who hates US intel, is a Duarte fan
t1_dum0vj0	0	*	Isn't he a murderer killing somebody that you disagree with cuz they use things you disagree with is still murder.
t1_dumh94c	1	*	US military ships re-fuel and resupply there, so doesn't mean much.
t1_dun94sn	0	*	Fake surveys done by private companies owned by his allies and cronies.   1000 respondents per survey =\= 100 million global population
t1_dumbgso	1	*	Doesnt china also have the death penalty for drug use, as well as singapore? 
t1_dun7vne	0	*	Out of interest, who did he genocide?
t1_dum9rv2	1	*	So that's it, huh? We some kinda death squad..
t1_duneyc5	1	*	Her people need distractions.
t1_dumh8yy	1	*	I'm acquainted with a bunch of Filipino Americans. They were very optimistic about him at first, but now I think they've mostly realized he's a fraud.
t1_dulv84q	1	*	Its a routine port visit 
t1_dumf54h	1	*	Same thing.
t1_dumjjcb	1	*	He's not stupid. His death squads are really, really unimpressive when the US could kill him with a single drone.  
t1_dulk3th	0	*	Whats PI?
t1_dum0jr7	0	*	What propaganda?  Intelligence services regularly release assessments like this.  Its only propaganda if its untrue and the source is unclear.  This is both true and issued in the clear.
t1_dumaa0p	1	*	To be fair they might not be friendly to me if I explained I believe all drugs should be legal to consume and possessed in smaller amounts. 
t1_dum8wwn	1	*	Isn't there typically a ship in that area? In thought the US Navy kept a presence there?
t1_dultg1s	1	*	Just heard about this book and another one called Inventing Reality by Michael Parenti yesterday. Interested in reading both. 
t1_dum8m67	1	*	Isn't he fighting maoist rebel factions? * auto correct almost made that moist rebel factions
t1_dum1qxh	1	*	People from the Philippines see him as a lord and their saviour 
t1_duma9rm	1	*	My family and parents who came from Philippines support him. Im kind of on the fence since I was not born and raised in philippines.
t1_dulnuut	1	*	Freedom^TM
t1_dum9edt	1	*	Don't you think how the locals see him is THE WHOLE POINT  of democracy? Shouldn't you be asking them not imposing your own values?
t1_dulpkz0	1	*	People love him in the Philippines! Especially people from Davao
t1_dulswgq	1	*	Bet the dope heads have lost dealers tho 
t1_dulzrd3	1	*	Why do people keep using the damn word tag or tagged. There isn't some publically available board where you tag countries, good bad evil. Stupid Reddit parrots.
t1_dulqyah	1	*	This any the fact we had him to the White House and now this.... Im not surprised at Frump   https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/04/30/us/politics/trump-duterte.html

t1_dumf64y	0	*	Very dictator-y for sure :)
t1_dulxk77	0	*	Correct. We are a representative republic
t1_dulqtrt	1	*	He's a threat to democracy because he  was elected president in a democratic way? Did you take your pills this morning? 
t1_dulujpm	0	*	>  Wonder how much each strongman gets from China to screw their country and people.  And how much are the puppets getting from the US... 
t1_du932qv	1	*	We all saw him fall-at airports, UN summits, etc
t1_du6oued	1	*	So about 3 of these full:    https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/95/Tank_truck9274341.jpg/1200px-Tank_truck9274341.jpg
t1_du6qkma	1	*	Also, picking a city it's as big as is an inherently useless metric. I've been to Paris and I would still have trouble quantifying how big it is. 
t1_dt3unzx	1	*	Def apps
t1_dt40wvw	1	*	As someone with mobile development experience: Apps.
t1_dv2d62l	1	*	Nah that wont matter, if an immigrant commits a crime they and their parents will be deported according to the new laws stated ^
t1_duoz8q5	0	*	In my language it's called Columbia, I never realized that in other languages they say Colombia
t1_duovz6e	1	*	Maybe in the NY university? 
t1_duorgpl	1	*	It's Steve Harvey's Reddit account.
t1_dtejh6w	0	*	Wow. You know I was about to call BS but googled it.   Fascinating read!   http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/01/health/01iht-01prof.14122951.html
t1_dsdb0uj	1	*	That horse oroginal name? glitterhoof
t1_du6qdcy	1	*	He will probably mysteriously die in prison.
t1_dsx0mv7	0	*	Those are meant to stop groping, which is an actual problem on some crowded Japanese trains.
t1_dtre3pn	1	*	nice pics. troubling just how quickly they pulled this off.
t1_dujse9q	1	*	>Cinnabon Erupts: entire mountain glazed
t1_dt23kl7	1	*	I was all over Germany last year. Koln, Munich, Berlin, etc.  People who say Germany is in trouble or a bad place are morons who haven't stepped foot in the country. 
t1_dt280es	1	*	Hello Mexican, I'm from Europe. I'm not sure if your interpretation of 'fucked up' is correct. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_intentional_homicide_rate#By_region
t1_dslijnu	0	*	Those poor souls who moved from Norway to the U.S....
t1_dslmc08	1	*	That's why Norwegians are 35x more likely to come to the US than the other way around. 
t1_dsljlzs	0	*	I would bet almost all the Norwegians who came to the US last year are Scientists/Researchers and their spouses. 
t1_ds9v85o	1	*	The court case is still ongoing
t1_dukzcf5	1	*	In principle yeah, but based on the recent actions of Poland, it seems like ulterior motives are present in these kind of things recently...
t1_dumgmcg	1	*	What?
t1_dul4era	1	*	Yeah. What're we up to now, 60,000,000,000?
t1_dtw9l3h	0	*	Don't forget Ethan Hawke died to a heart attack 1/4 of the way to Titan, and the spaceship crew, left without navigator, was doomed to slow death lost in space.
t1_du2gfgu	0	*	You need money to offer reparations.
t1_dsxcyxj	1	*	Sadly your not wrong. People dont buy Tim Hortons because its good they buy it because its convenient.  
t1_dt6ccpe	1	*	Well they're from the US in the first place.
t1_dt6gxed	1	*	I adopted a cat from PR a few months back now, should I just send him back to the address on his adoption paper work? 
t1_dt642fx	1	*	Because they have assets sitting around in PR that need attending to or liquidating before they can fully relocate to the US. Example: land or a home.
t1_dt6evzx	1	*	META af
t1_dttisdx	1	*	Moon?
t1_du4x8i0	0	*	Yeah, it's completely sunk but the masts are still visible and the area is marked and cordoned off due to the risk of explosion to this day...
t1_ds5n1n3	1	*	Thank you Mr. AutoModerator. Ill try to find sources without a paywall in the future.
t1_dua5u2c	0	*	> Italy  you have a place called Italy?
t1_dua5j30	1	*	> See Australia for example.  Mate we have heaps of guns.  Pls dont be dishonest with us all to push an agenda.
t1_dua3j91	1	*	Vegas seems a distant memory then
t1_dua6e0l	1	*	Why would you shoot yourself at an elementary school?? Jesus Christ 
t1_dua62xx	1	*	The cases of self defense or home defense don't get publicity.
t1_dua6o8j	0	*	That's a good idea to expand on. First thought, how do you irradiate all the existing firearms out there? Especially the unregistered ones?
t1_dua8x79	1	*	They probably won't use a knife, they'll probably use a bomb or just a truck.  See multiple cities in Europe for examples of the latter.
t1_dua8d1y	0	*	You do know the stats are almost always based of percentages and kills per 100k pop, so total population does not really factor into it.
t1_dua384y	0	*	Nah, its guns. No other industrialized western country has the gun problems the US have.
t1_dua2m0c	0	*	You made a typographical error.
t1_dua7fx7	1	*	The same group of people that claim to need guns to overthrow a tyrannical leader are the ones who embrace our current tyrannical leader.          A bit ironic,  isn't it?
t1_dua6l3z	1	*	Criminals for sure will follow the laws just like they follow the laws for drugs. 
t1_dua5c97	1	*	Because in the US, personal preferences (to own guns) outweighs the human rights of others (to not be murdered). 
t1_dua4cpw	0	*	There's plenty of evidence in Western society that citizens do not need to be armed against their government. Democracy works.
t1_dua4l06	0	*	Meanwhile there are places in the world that actually deserve that title... US might not be in the greatest state at the moment, but its a lot better than a lot of places. 
t1_dua435c	1	*	Its all about the money and power. Thats why children are being shot does not change the situation
t1_dua5k7l	1	*	[map](https://i.imgur.com/x3ieCfR.png) of no go zones
t1_dua4b2k	0	*	Guns make killing people a whole lot easier.
t1_dua5hne	1	*	Got any hard data to back up your statistics claim?
t1_dua54th	1	*	Wow, amazing game     The end screen really hits right home
t1_dua4fp6	1	*	The same way there's an opioid epidemic that claimed 60K+ lives and yet our pharmaceutical companies are still producing them and doctors still prescribing them. 
t1_dua4v0d	1	*	Then you could just wipe yourselves out completely, guns for all!
t1_dua6fan	1	*	Agreed.  Mostly it's praying Please don't be me or someone I know.
t1_dua47zf	0	*	The Department of Education Defense.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_of_1999
t1_duc3m8u	1	*	Only 3 school shootings this year? Well, you guys clearly don't have a problem with it then! 
t1_dua54fj	0	*	I mean that's great on paper but are you willing to go door to door looking for weapons? Worked great in Iraq /s
t1_dua5lky	1	*	You realize the type of weapons youre referencing are already banned in the USA
t1_dua4wms	0	*	(https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_attack_on_Dallas_police)  
t1_ds7le2n	1	*	Most electricity in brazil comes from hydro
t1_ds7n3sm	1	*	Way to go Brazil!
t1_ds938hl	0	*	You neglect the massive advantage of hydro that you can choose when to generate the electricity. Hydroelectric storage is the most efficient form of electric storage that currently exists. 
t1_ds8jzcf	0	*	We don't need mega dams in California. We need shit tons of small retention and infiltration systems all over. 
t1_dtagovo	1	*	The local Sheraton doesnt exactly scream luxury. 
t1_dtb5o9d	1	*	But it tastes so good!
t1_dtam043	1	*	Das nasty as fuck
t1_dt9rb0g	1	*	Or India.... Or Bangladesh. It's a big world out there mate.
t1_dtbcu1h	1	*	Nice whataboutism
t1_dtaphc8	1	*	God, just imagining the collective backwash accumulated from all that contaminated soup makes me dry wretch
t1_dta9oiv	1	*	I watched the video. They knew exactly what they were doing was wrong. 
t1_dta932o	1	*	To be fair, so is China.
t1_dtau0w2	1	*	Ive seen people doing the same thing in the US
t1_dtav6wo	0	*	You should visit Hong Kong if you can. It's nice. 
t1_dtarpx5	1	*	I once mentioned to my dad at a hawker stand: They handle and place money on the same surface they use to prepare food, and without gloves.
t1_dt9ttsq	1	*	Yeah... No, definitely not.
t1_dta4c9c	1	*	I always do this but great advice!
t1_dscj88c	0	*	I'm seeing that one of these countries has a lot more Japanese people than the other. Your point?
t1_dscfnq1	0	*	Hell yeah! Asel is such a cute little baby!
t1_dsc8ruf	1	*	Keep dreaming, cocksucker.
t1_dsd8wtw	1	*	that baby gona be indoctrinated into islam asap..... that sad as fuck
t1_dsby5i2	1	*	Nobody should cares what they want to call it when they treat an entire group of people like shit. 
t1_dsch74z	1	*	Fascism and nationalism. Thats whats wrong with them
t1_dscbzf6	1	*	Can we crowdfund your removal?
t1_dscadxw	1	*	Racism
t1_dscah2k	1	*	Hitler was actually pretty found of Muslim warriors, said he wished Christians had that kind of loyalty and courage or some nonsense 
t1_dsce10d	1	*	/u/CommaHorror's secondary account?
t1_dscvfhl	0	*	Gateway. You are a poet.
t1_dsbxf8e	0	*	Nobody should cares what they want to call it when they treat an entire group of people like shit. 
t1_dscd0x0	1	*	They did, but dingoes stole them, so it didn't really count. 
t1_dsd1p77	1	*	Comparing Zell am See is like saying the three blocks of Chinatown in <city x> is growing the Chinese populatin without control.
t1_dsccfcb	1	*	What kind of odd things?
t1_dscehgv	1	*	And I'm sure there were some nativists in the 19th century who predicted all Americans would be Irish and Catholic by 1950.
t1_dscstzr	0	*	Its a big announcement in the newspaper, so everyone knows. 
t1_dscg2sm	1	*	By this logic, it should be illegal for parents to send their kids to Sunday school.
t1_dsc9d21	1	*	That's what ultrasound is for
t1_dscaku8	1	*	At this point the majority of babies born in California are hispanic (or non-white, can't remember which one). Makes it even dumber than the muslim one. 
t1_dsc9xxx	1	*	Oh come on. Austria has always been a bit conservative and yes Hitler was born on its soil. But you are not Germany. Have an apfelstrudel. 
t1_dscnzy5	1	*	Cabose no
t1_dsc9enl	1	*	That sounds like bad pregnancy advice.
t1_dscjniu	0	*	Maybe when our brains get a bit bigger. I sometimes wonder this myself though. Cruelty seems to be ingrained in us.
t1_dsc9q8h	0	*	I'd suggest a mandatory nationwide field-trip to Auschwitz to get some perspective, but I'm afraid that would just give them ideas...
t1_dsc1v9p	0	*	> austria vote a nazi into power.  because let us not pretend sebastian cunt is anything but a nazi
t1_dsc7a1y	1	*	Humans are monsters really, just look at a history book and it seems pretty obvious to me 
t1_dsbxywt	1	*	it's Austria. Hitler's childhood swing is still probably there.
t1_dscnfzz	1	*	You cannot reason with the mind of a conservative. 
t1_dsckylp	1	*	Yep everyone need to remember that people are only as good as their circumstances allow them.
t1_dscfzh6	1	*	Thank you for putting things into perspective here. 
t1_dscbgg7	0	*	And that's reason to hope a new born baby dies?
t1_dsccetb	0	*	Why would you, when it's a country that birthed Hitler?
t1_dsc4afj	0	*	I live it when Americans pretend that they don't have a way bigger problem relating to race.
t1_dscbomm	1	*	You may be getting cause and effect mixed up here but yeah otherwise you're right.
t1_dscpn6j	0	*	What exactly is the point youre trying to make? Islamophobia is okay because Islam isnt a race? 
t1_dscw3ba	1	*	The Nazis actually only came a very close second. So the situation is in no way terrifying. 
t1_dscjja6	0	*	what are you talking about?
t1_dscipyx	1	*	discrimination and hate has plagued us by setting stereotypes
t1_dsd2kr2	1	*	Crazy parents making Facebook profiles for their soon to be born offspring.
t1_dscg78g	0	*	Who forced what? People having babies is pretty natural.
t1_dsci8lx	1	*	I'll never get why people treat religions and races as the same for prejudice though.
t1_dscf8kb	0	*	Oh i guess that makes wishing cot death on a newborn a-ok. Nothing to See here folks, move along. 
t1_dscg17m	1	*	First I've heard of this.   Thanks Austria for making us Americans look less crazy in comparison. 
t1_dschxlh	1	*	Wow dude! Aren't you just fucking peachy... 
t1_dsck41x	1	*	Human
t1_dscj25k	0	*	Its Britain first, and they are islamaphobes but not racist , its free speech and we are allowed to criticise them for it and thats ok
t1_dscyms1	1	*	and the winner of Most Melodramatic Comment of the Day goes to...
t1_dsc5v2f	1	*	They are already looking inward, in their butts. This is how they get new ideas.
t1_dscqiev	0	*	Oh my God, I fucking hate people like you. Get off the internet. Please. You add nothing to do the discussion.
t1_dsclgdb	0	*	Its not but we hope someday it will
t1_dscv47s	1	*	You have to be a pretty damn terrible person to wish ill on someone, period.

t1_duguynx	0	*	You ever tried telling somebody too dumb to know how dumb they are what to do?
t1_dugpdui	1	*	The GOP won't, at least not until after midterms.  They're going to be fighting for their party's life in November (even though it's a longshot that they'll lose BOTH houses off Congress).
t1_dugwbfl	1	*	Everything I don't like is hate speech! RRREEEEEEE
t1_duh0zrp	1	*	I voted Hillary reluctantly
t1_dugq21a	1	*	Agreed! Its entertaining and terrifying at the same time. 
t1_dugqpt6	1	*	If he finally breaks it apart and fucks it up beyond repair he definitely will be. At least for the rest of the world.
t1_dugu1yx	1	*	Is this just fantasy?
t1_dugmgqo	1	*	Wasnt us. Ya know that deep govt the trumps like to scream about ? Thats who did this. 
t1_duh8t4d	1	*	tbf if everyone ignored trump's tweets, the world would be a better place.
t1_duguiyd	1	*	I'm going to ignore him.
t1_dugrtkc	1	*	You're totally not oversimplifying who voted for him, or who manipulated our voters into doing so. 
t1_duh095p	1	*	I'm cool with that
t1_dugptmu	1	*	That's prob what the russian wants
t1_dugpcqe	1	*	Until we sober up. Thanks for understanding.
t1_dugpoil	1	*	I mean. I tried not to. 
t1_dugvr8i	1	*	Yes. This is called 'top secret' and Trump is too stupid to understand that.  
t1_dugse18	1	*	hey hey... i voted against
t1_dugrlzp	1	*	I think it was a mistake 
t1_duh1ruz	1	*	It [already has](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BBvIweCIgwk).
t1_dugsgwj	1	*	Lol thank you! You Nailed it. 
t1_dugu50y	0	*	Nobody named. So it didn't happen 
t1_dugrse6	0	*	Exactly, they are pointing out its what he thinks and not what everyone else in government thinks.
t1_dugu1dx	1	*	You forgot the word stable. 
t1_dugwe6t	0	*	This Obama-era American self loathing is going to make 2020 an easy victory for Trump.
t1_dugsicz	1	*	Please ignore the official statements.
t1_dugrz0l	0	*	Ya man everything in this world is orchestrated by the lizard people who live in the clouds. 
t1_duh0za3	1	*	It's an admission that _this_ president has no power, and that the people who are really running the country are trying to avoid a constitutional crisis.  
t1_duwin20	1	*	More like oil prices in general and shale oil's accessibility in particular. And, sure, the Russkies themselves, those, who steal oil money instead of investing it, these people also play their part.
t1_ds8w9ig	1	*	Well and succinctly put.
t1_du63usg	0	*	Both pilots are fine. A Russian AA missle exploded near the plane & damaged it, so they followed protocol by evacuating & letting the plane fall
t1_dtj9c86	1	*	It *is* over. Everyone knows it by now, and most knew it even before this whole thing happened. Nothing changes.
t1_dutp2v3	1	*	nice try ISIS
t1_dv3hlrp	1	*	Invincible to missile defence! LOL yeah right. what a joke. 
t1_dv31gbe	1	*	Do you believe that this is true and that Russia really has that?   Every once in a while he needs to shout some shit to keep it going as usual in Russia, but in reality nothing changes much. 
t1_dtv6hc2	1	*	No, Elon stated such at the press conference and it has been reported in many places.
t1_dsm3twt	1	*	Not news worthy or impressive. Honestly, he is a wealthy celebrity who seems to constantly have been on the prowl, his numbers should be way higher. 
t1_dv2av1w	0	*	Another source:  https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/02/27/immigration-visa-quagmire-forces-san-jose-cafe-owner-to-self-deport/
t1_dscwcco	1	*	So nightshade poison. It's called Deadly Nightshade for a reason!
t1_dty6i4t	1	*	Republicans will turn on each other at a moment's notice because that party is chaotic quilt of different brands of conservatism, many of which don't get along outside of the Republican banner.
t1_dty34bg	0	*	Now they are saying it *did* happen and that we should lock up Hillary Clinton for it.
t1_du7fnu1	0	*	Yeah. This occurred about 8 hours ago..
t1_dtd1vqm	0	*	No, you're just tactless.
t1_dtd5qc3	1	*	https://youtu.be/HowXEBisrkI  
t1_dtd27eu	0	*	Probably the allen key 
t1_dt5y9j3	1	*	> I dearly hope they preserve it and make it a historical site   Hopefully the person who owns the land it is on agrees with you.
t1_dtun218	1	*	This is an abnormal situation where a modern Western nation has a completely dysfunctional grid.  Tesla's battery was specifically put in place because of very unusual market conditions.
t1_dtuopsr	1	*	What did America do to deserve it?
t1_dtulmxv	1	*	American can spread the electricity around better, I'd assume.
t1_dupoliy	0	*	Yes, there is something wrong about him, just a feeling.
t1_dsa4i2d	0	*	Looks like Blacked Friday in the US.
t1_dskduef	1	*	Drinks containers being the only exception, easily solved with a deposit scheme
t1_dtvcwi1	1	*	I pledge allegiance, to the Cheetos...
t1_dtx2kx5	0	*	Why not is because military persons have literally said military servicemen DON'T like parades. And that even they think its a waste of money. Read the article before you comment 
t1_du61rxf	0	*	Yes.  FTR, the stats won't show that. But bamboo and mangrove are explicitly called out in the article.
t1_du68dyn	0	*	Whats old growth?
t1_dtmec5i	0	*	The media plays up military service to no end.  Everyone who serves is hero, & if you don't agree with that you don't support our troops. 
t1_dt3rm9h	1	*	I don't think the average dock worker has ever held a bar of silver/gold... not has any interest in purchasing one. So their knowledge is probably limited 
t1_dt2ghnp	0	*	Will they bother looking at volume?  Also, they could have added other items to make the volume seem correct.
t1_dt29djc	1	*	>firm he says painted 5 tons of gold to look like silver  He was trying to get the gold metal.
t1_dt35c6o	1	*	The only way these big firms can get caught are if something big falls... like Enron.
t1_dt2vazo	1	*	*SHHHHHH!*
t1_dt2ybmk	1	*	I got the joke, but only because I'm old; terribly old.
t1_dt2ig35	0	*	Not very smart.  If i was them i would have painted 5 tons of gold with bitcoin, that way it is worth more.
t1_duxfaxm	1	*	Pretty sure Israel is going to attack them before that.
t1_dux8zg9	0	*	They're running out of time to sell their oil, and in order to survive as a country they've installed new and modern leadership, and seem to be attempting to culturally modernize.
t1_dtlqk22	1	*	Nerf probably made one already.  It's got a metal rod surrounded by amazingly comfy foam.
t1_dtlvnqi	0	*	Fossil fuels have a pretty decent energy density; so they can charge the huge capacitors with standard (but large) gas turbines.  They're just not going to be shooting it in rapid succession.
t1_dtlv25j	1	*	The Nerf rail gun.
t1_dtmk3po	1	*	Set electromagnetic rail guns to stun!
t1_dtm4bph	1	*	Why not? It's perfectly within China's capabilities to build a ship that could field a rail gun
t1_dtldyzj	0	*	If it is a railgun then it would be a highly experimental version. I'm guessing a landing craft would be a good test-bed - plenty of empty space for power and instruments and stuff like that. 
t1_dtlitg9	1	*	> Their development seems like a step backwards in naval warfare to the days of battleships.    The navy still uses artillery, a railgun is potentially better artillery.  
t1_dtm7g23	1	*	What a fucking joke. Go to bed sxf6ta bror 
t1_dtmdn9h	0	*	Yeah, where have you been?
t1_dtlerct	0	*	The nonlethal version shoots rubber rails.
t1_dumpx4j	1	*	Just make an AI our God then? God would be the entity which creates. 
t1_dsd8bon	1	*	I'll take four.
t1_duvuxy4	1	*	Everyone wants to be a victim these days. 
t1_duwehfc	1	*	If a government or other party remove it lawfully, then it might be a right in philosophy101 class, but not in reality.
t1_duwhtdo	0	*	More like [Emmanuel_Goldstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmanuel_Goldstein)
t1_duvana6	1	*	Haha.  Prima facie.  
t1_dupclr6	0	*	Restriction!? America is all about **FREEDOM**.  The **FREEDOM** of owning guns cannot be taken away from democratic & patriotic American people.  **FREEDOM!!**
t1_dus8nvm	1	*	T-50,  SU 57,  Chevy Cavalier, Cadillac Cimmaron, Buick Skylark, Olds Omega. Just assign a different name and confuse people into believing you have a decent vehicle.
t1_dtvr6fk	0	*	Never let a good reason to point fingers at USA pass by!  Also, whataboutism!
t1_dtvfbdd	0	*	Also he was 18 ehen he was executed.
t1_dtx2vu0	1	*	Yeah. Everyone is talking about the girl in the child marriage, but executing someone who at age 15 killed another teenager in a street fight is pretty brutally unforgiving. 
t1_dtvniu2	1	*	You can't have been in many Iran threads then.
t1_dtw5jj7	1	*	I was wondering how far down Id have to scroll to see someone somehow turn this horrific fact across the globe into a slam against the U.S.  As always, not far at all.
t1_dtvd2tl	1	*	I wouldnt be so fast to condemn the second case. You dont what happened to girl married of at 13...
t1_dtvnnwt	0	*	how many kids have US cops killed this year?
t1_ducbffk	1	*	> Mexico  >  central and south American countries  Hmmmmmm...
t1_duc97q5	0	*	So what you say is, they had huge success in improving their base of technology by exploiting the greed and stupidity of others.
t1_dubyq3y	0	*	Could it be? Is this honest to goodness PRC propaganda. Fascinating.  China wants to steal trillions in research. They can fuck right off.
t1_dubxzjm	0	*	>I wish this post had as many up votes as the '60.000 tree planting in china'.    Why?  
t1_dubzgio	1	*	I reported this thread for the highly highly credible source too..
t1_dudtmn6	1	*	The large market is a bait. You will never be able to get the money out. 
t1_dubu5mg	0	*	> Week vs Strong.  I assume you're the weak in this situation, right?
t1_duc016k	1	*	Never to late to start WW3. Long live the Great American Empire! 
t1_duchfdt	1	*	My fist is shaking so hard that I can't even continue to shake it.
t1_dubynu3	0	*	Our economy is R&D based now. We spend hundreds of billions, possibly 1T, on R&D every year.
t1_dubzfr3	0	*	Such as? China literally allows everyone that supposedly you guys allow..
t1_dubu3rx	0	*	7 days vs the strong? China only ruling one of those days? 
t1_dudd7gy	1	*	Western companies have used cheap Chinese labor to successfully brake western labor unions, they now want more direct access to growing Chinese consumer markets.  Greed has no bounds. 
t1_dsbyrvz	1	*	You do know that such laws exist all across the west as well, right?
t1_dt48t6w	1	*	And an eruption in Japan aswell
