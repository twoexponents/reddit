t1_dsv6vx0	1	*	Paying slightly less in taxes isn't a salary raise. Plus our premiums will go up eating any new money not paid to taxes. For most people their paycheck will actually get smaller.

t1_ds3j6vd	0	*	They don't refuse it because most agree to it. And they benefit tremendously. Money not spent on the millitary, is money spent on social programs that benefit the people.

t1_dttx45i	1	*	But the royal family is a very small number of people, its irrelevant to the conversation. Most wealthy Brits are still self made or inherited their wealth so I dont see the context.

t1_dulkuqr	0	*	Now now.. since we've resorted to speculating to suit our narratives, how about why couldn't have Nepal made up an excuse in order to cozy up to China?. There. How does it sound?
t1_dshj0mj	1	*	So, again, why not have open borders?
t1_dtw7us7	1	*	Sure :)

t1_duxr27c	0	*	This guy punks
t1_duy1f2j	0	*	It's a nice trick to muddy the water. He should objectively say which government he'd rather live under and why.  What he's doing is saying they're equal, and that he wants neither.

t1_dsp7rdb	0	*	I'd call it a very primitive microphone, if it was attached to a big computer which processed and could very easily record that data, then I guess so. 
t1_dsn50po	0	*	I replied to a different thread, but the short answer is that we've tested and trained for a long time and our equipment for AEGIS ships should allow for is to intercept.

t1_dsn45hq	1	*	Hey maybe he will do an AMA later 
t1_dsn77ma	1	*	More like there's probably a hundred people to call to make sure it is for sure a false alarm and figure out how it happened

t1_dth7ged	1	*	They have the right to life which is what the point was. We dont give that right based on problem solving ability, otherwise we would have to give it to computers, too. 
t1_du8xqtu	0	*	Well I mean I don't have to search you to know your view about race and nationality after the claims you made.
t1_duv89vv	0	*	You know him? Does he smell? He looks like he smells. He also seems like the type that would pontificate and at the end you realize he was just spouting nonsense.
t1_duv9w78	1	*	That's the price you pay for being an imperialist (acting as the world police). Comes with its costs and benefits.

t1_duuqh9s	0	*	This has nothing to do with slavery in the US in the 1800s.  Are you trying to say the Chinese organ harvesting isn't that bad because there were slaves in the US? 
t1_duulyo8	0	*	whales are killed quickly and painlessly. By grenade exploding harpoon to the head (in norway anyway, dont know about other places).

t1_duuy5ig	1	*	Old enough to get a joke
t1_duukeqs	1	*	Get ready to bow to Indian and Chinese cultural whims then. You realize the west has less population than even the total number of Muslims right? 
t1_duv30cc	0	*	Thanks for the link! Pretty heinous for sure. Would you say they constitute the same level of severity as that which happens in China? 
t1_duxkrs7	1	*	Brad Pitt was in an M4A3 IIRC. The M3 Stuart was a piece of turd even compared to that.
t1_duv4b8q	0	*	I'm sure some protests aren't interfered with.  Some =/ all. Go Google people being jailed for protesting in the USA.  There's plenty of results.

t1_dsi63sc	1	*	It is not my job to unveil you of your ignorance.
t1_dsh18kd	1	*	lol. It is about the costs to run a franchise. Look at the math the accountant did. Is there something wrong with his calculations?
t1_dshjdba	0	*	Wrong. The Bankruptcy Court gets paid first.   Certain employee claims are given fourth priority under 11 USC 507(a)(4)   https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/507

t1_dudt0jg	0	*	Yeah trust me I fully understand the long hellish road ahead of me. I greet it with ambition. 
t1_dudy8st	0	*	Or would it be worse to be a blue person living under ground? Or to be able to fly? Hypotheticals are fun. I'd choose being invisible FYI. 
t1_due0vco	0	*	It would be worse to not have the drug. But thats not the scenario as presented so why even delve into that hypothetical?

t1_dun5v6n	0	*	>in capitalism people are forced by competition to be the best, make the most, etc.  Are they? What mechanism does that?

t1_dtc7b8c	1	*	So if a million armed arabs show up at their border, it's an invasion. But if they drop their weapons and cross the border, then now it's immigration? 
t1_dtbd9mz	0	*	You are okay with excluding certain immigrants based on their ethnic status. That is an apartheid law, similar to pre-1994 South Africa, Jim Crow United States, White Australia policy, etc.

t1_dsra0jp	0	*	It's fine. Law & Order is really niche. I like the show, but some episodes just blow major ass. Especially when it comes to illustrating a point, some episodes miss the mark by miles.
t1_dsqhxex	0	*	I take public transportation every single day, what point are you trying to make? 
t1_dsqwvn0	0	*	Just hard to watch. This subreddit seems so backwards and not at all indicative of Canada.  But maybe Im wrong and it is, which scares me

t1_dsqa7nk	1	*	Seems like they're pretty synonymous in their mind, doesn't it? 
t1_ds5lsq9	0	*	You've already dismissed such a possibility, so no, the onus is on you. This is public knowledge, not extraordinary, you can do your own 2 minutes of googling yourself.
t1_dszfted	1	*	Yes, and that makes this more likely to be true. He rewards those close to him with jobs and titles.If he was sleeping with someone, it would not be out of character to do something like this.
t1_dsxgtt0	0	*	And I'm pro government on a lot of things that actually help people like the things you listed, what i dont support is a government thats willing to turn its citizens into criminals for money.

t1_dt1p731	1	*	Whenever someone speaks about the good socialist states, especially in Europe, what they mean is Populist states.

t1_dt1bobd	1	*	People's Liberation Army
t1_dt37lge	1	*	That's not the claim I made. I said I haven't seen it where i live, which you said is bullshit.

t1_dsinqq4	0	*	Tesla's charge a lot quicker than that
t1_dsio149	1	*	Why is no hospital going to just let people die? Oh because we are rules in place ensuring they have to treat it and then the government ends up paying and we pay more in the long run. 
t1_dsimgag	1	*	It is literally a subsidy. The manufacturer is selling a product at a more competitive out the door price because of the government incentive. It is quite literally the definition of subsidy.

t1_dted0j0	0	*	Not everyone would opt into sterilization, the goal would be to gently lower the population, so the economic worries are moot. Also, you severely overestimate the cost of euthanasia.

t1_dtu7nid	1	*	Why do you care so much? Are you traveling to Poland with intent of starting shit or are you just caring of ignorant people?
t1_dtvkho9	1	*	Legally sure, ethically I disagree. If you want license to do whatever the fuck you want then accept the tag of asshole that comes with it gracefully as well.
t1_du9ev35	1	*	Yes what you describe is how it's supposed to work.  It's also a completely different thing from how it actually works.

t1_dt8jtuj	1	*	I think you've probably given this 'Charming character more time then he deserves. 
t1_dtlx3se	0	*	But what does that have to do with me being AltRight..?
t1_dtmopee	1	*	No.
t1_dtnrvqi	0	*	adultery is a religious concept installed into law to satisfy Christian ideology, any attempt to enforce such a law is equivalent to the enforcement of sharia law.... discussed...
t1_du9fyzo	1	*	Yeah, long term solutions rarely ever solve immediate problems.  The best time to implement a long term solution is before an emergency occurs. The next best time is now.   
t1_du9uinm	1	*	Also west texas, and the few hundred miles between Austin and San Antonio. And pretty much along the entire mexican border
t1_du9ksl4	1	*	Is this some sort of haiku? 
t1_du9rru9	1	*	And you sir, are you ready to receive my flaccid cactus?
t1_du9rd92	1	*	No disagreement there my friend. Really I'm just being pedantic
t1_du9mkj8	1	*	And they're back in as of last year I thought.
t1_du9fph3	0	*	I haven't gotten out west as recently as I'd like but I dunno, I feel like a Whopper was as good if not better than the Whataburger I've had in Gallup, NM.
t1_duaqqi5	1	*	Theyre not mass shootings either though. The list hes talking about includes shit like a kid shooting a pellet gun 3 blocks away. We havent had 19 shootings or mass murders. Theyre both lies 
t1_du9f8wj	1	*	They like the salt inside it. It actually helps their health believe it or not. This is another reason to not pee on plants/trees: deer will tear up tohe bark for the salt in the piss.
t1_du82bdf	0	*	I cited an example. 
t1_du8cldm	1	*	That wasnt the original point though at least not in what i replied to.

t1_dsvt51v	1	*	Yeah, the one I saw was 15 feet from me too.  It was on my 1/2 mile driveway in the foothills.

t1_dswo1su	1	*	I heard the total deaths of communism was around 9 billion
t1_dtj3j5w	1	*	You will see I clearly said a majority government.  The SCC isn't truly a check due to the notwithstanding clause being capable of nullifying decisions.
t1_ds7vb04	1	*	Yeah that's about the same as here when you take into account the exchange rate. I pay roughly that (80 CAD) for a high speed no-limit connection.
t1_ds84fe8	1	*	It's nice because we're all friends.
t1_ds87y3t	1	*	They shiver in the AC in the middle of the summer, it's not even like it needs to be below 60, lol.

t1_ds897r1	1	*	Ah sorry, I inflated a bit it seems. 
t1_ds91lrl	1	*	Canadian here. I agree that Italian is the best European cuisine. :)
t1_ds869e2	1	*	I'll stand by it. But at least that's a fair comparaison and an argument can be made for Italy  (and Japan,  and Thailand, and..)
t1_ds7wgyi	1	*	Celcius
t1_ds8qe6z	1	*	 I started a clusterfuck of a comment thread by basically saying Im no expert but I bet...   Lol
t1_ds7wlre	1	*	People in Europe pay 40 euros for 1000 down/1000up and we have people over here bragging about 10/10. God save us all 
t1_ds8nfks	1	*	Really?   You are going to defend THAT GUY of all people?   The one who is in charge of the committee that is gutting the internet for profit?   Fuck you.

t1_ds7zbpv	0	*	That's probably centigrade. Pretty much no one uses Fahrenheit
t1_ds8eh5l	0	*	They're just mad cause we get it all. All their good, and shitty food, we got it.   Plus, we got hot wings and pizza down to a fuckin science. COME AT ME.
t1_ds869b0	1	*	Maybe.  Some reports put it at 60/40, others at 40/60.  Either way, the border needs secured.  It's not an either/or scenario.
t1_ds814zj	1	*	Always weirds me out that I live in Michigan and there are parts of Canada further south than me.
t1_ds8fkwd	0	*	 This just isn't true. They didn't have nukes for decades and nobody destroyed them. Their protection isn't nukes, it's China.

t1_ds7wcv2	1	*	Yea it's been -38 here the last few days. Ugh.
t1_ds87dm4	0	*	That is so false, but youre an ideologue so its not even worth engaging with. South Koreans are Koreans. They dont want totalitarianism. 
t1_dsggoel	0	*	Any suggestion regarding OP's article that you are reading into my statement is pure projection on your part -- as I pointed out to you hours ago.
t1_dsgatel	0	*	What interview? We are talking about Woulffs book.

t1_dsihz22	1	*	>Have you been single handedly fighting your companies accountants on ensuring they don't use any tax saving tricks?  Funny enough, making sure people follow the tax law is exactly what I do.
t1_dsg3vmo	1	*	Fusion GPS also investigated Obama while he was a senator. So what? Theyre an independent company.  
t1_dshfktu	1	*	I was going to say, I don't quite get the State Department but I guess if no one is talking with authority to other countries, it's much easier to do those global deals sans oversight.
t1_dsg5iwf	1	*	> It definitely shows on Facebook for me at least  yea and thats ur prob right there. 
t1_dsg6elx	1	*	No joke though
t1_dsgzg0g	1	*	Have you looked at the odds on Trump getting impeached?   http://www.paddypower.com/bet/politics/other-politics/donald-trump?ev_oc_grp_ids=2944322  Short odds on something thats never going to happen.
t1_dsg5cqk	1	*	 We still are
t1_dsg7tq1	0	*	Fuck you. The only people to blame for Trump are the idiots who voted for him. 
t1_dsge3i8	0	*	I know I was. I was a Bernie voter that voted for Clinton in the general.
t1_dtk3a0q	1	*	Only if you ignore the comment where I say I'm just bored does it appear like I'm missing the point.
t1_dshkq40	1	*	If they ever have elections again, we'll find out how popular they are in the WB
t1_dshh6gq	0	*	You kind of missed my point. The Palestinians have been trying invasions, and bombing while violating human rights. When are they going to try something different?
t1_dshj0mt	0	*	They could make concessions. like what everyone does when they lose a war. 
t1_dt3kojt	1	*	Yeah I have. I still cant justify sending a rocket to anTurkish city full of civilians.   Ill look it up! 
t1_dubbg7s	0	*	You do sound like an rather uneducated fool.  The amount of BS you are spreading is hilarious.
t1_dslbnd5	0	*	Correct. I have no such issues.
t1_dssf1ui	0	*	Another dumb opinion. How many more do you have? 
t1_dsghpkn	1	*	meaning that America didn't fight in japan.
t1_dspaacq	0	*	So you think it's a payload of low yield MIRVs for tactical use?  If the system replacing it is an SLCM it seems the intended use case is clearly a single warhead, right?
t1_dueov7e	0	*	Maybe it's necessary.  They need a good kick in the bollocks to realize it's not 1950 anymore.
t1_dtr06kh	1	*	Yikes.
t1_dtqcm2y	0	*	Lol Ok. Sorry I'm not a brave warrior like you. Have a good weekend hero!

t1_dsmq8tc	0	*	Absolutely! Why not both?
t1_dslt671	0	*	He should be too. They all should be. 
t1_dslsj5j	0	*	It you think it's only about emails then you are on the same iq level as Trump.   Its about government corrupt, silly billy.
t1_dsltium	1	*	No, I brought them up because the Right *always* brings them up anytime Trump is criticized. Case in point, look at some of the comments in response to my post.
t1_duusqly	0	*	You are assuming 'they' = Duterte.  The headline reads 'Filipinos'.  
t1_duurylh	0	*	So you agree with my definition, and he's done those things. So he's corrupt?
t1_duuqgq2	0	*	He said try to mass murder congressmen so hes still right in the German sense. Giffords is one congressperson and the only one present and targeted in the shooting. 
t1_duvoz6y	0	*	Still didn't answer my question. Are you or are you not an idiot that let himself be swindled by the known lier because mexicans and walls and stuff
t1_duv4s6e	1	*	You're right. Republicans aren't fiscally conservative. They're properly fucking insane.   Fiscal conservatism as an ideology is what we were discussing, though. 
t1_duxl41x	0	*	But your post just now made it you with the last word...lol
t1_duuhapb	0	*	Happy now...? Did you get your fix...!?
t1_duvmz3z	0	*	You're right. In that case, the antifa were violent, which is good for the alt-right. Which is what I was saying. Bud. 
t1_dscfx15	1	*	The obsessive need some have to see Trump burst into flames leads to very silly statements.   Trump Derangement Syndrome is real.
t1_ds1c2q8	0	*	It was a more civilised age - and the only ID I had was the envelope with my name on it (spelled wrong).
t1_ds74ylq	1	*	You are right that that changing the world isnt enough, but it is an acceptable reason for investors to see 100%++ of revenue reinvested into R&D and capacity expansion.
t1_ds6lf3t	1	*	Id prefer if you didnt just say No with nothing else at all... I have one of these running in my house. Its not an ASIC bitcoin miner so it doesnt cost a fortune to run
t1_ds64kbx	1	*	Now I'm all fucked up about how similar the model names are. <br>Edit: Seriously though lobbying should be illegal. wtf
t1_ds6h54u	1	*	By that logic Walmart employees would be unionized by now.    The minute a company gets word about a union forming they fire those employees.  
t1_ds5xcb8	1	*	Why would I compare it to a $50K Focus? There isn't one. Even a Focus RS is only $41K.  Name a $50K EV right now other than this one?
t1_ds5zbye	1	*	I don't know but if nobody is answering, that ain't a good sign.
t1_ds5z25w	1	*	>Maybe you should try educating yourself someone that isn't Elon's pants.  I'll get right on that...

t1_ds66gq7	1	*	i ended up with a volt!  i'm super happy with it.  and with these delays, you never know; maybe i'll have more time than i thought to save up a down payment for the 3.
t1_dt8j61g	1	*	Well, we did try to leave Iraq.

t1_duzdofk	1	*	This is just getting depressing now...

t1_dsc1mtq	0	*	Bin Laden, according to US media reports back in the day. Im going off memory from the prevailing narrative of the time.
t1_dsa1kzf	0	*	>to lead a party  No, not even close. Primaries are for what candidate is going to be run by a party in a given election and area.
t1_dsbwnko	1	*	Border guards are the same kind of power tripping assholes everywhere.
t1_ds9uq86	1	*	Its not written that way. It specifically says all men, but for some unexplainable reason it has been interpreted Time and time again to mean only citizens. 
t1_dsg1afo	1	*	Agree to disagree, but the up/downvotes dont lie :)
t1_dsap5cs	0	*	Yeah the little bitch that decided to make fun of my murdered friend. I've already reported you for harassment.

t1_duar5nn	1	*	Homosapien male genitalia
t1_dtsroch	0	*	Freedom to shun personally? Sure, that's Freedom of Association. Freedom to browbeat others into shunning as well? I'd disagree there; that's an assault on other people's Freedom of Association.

t1_due25ns	0	*	I was pointing out the ridiculousness of his argument, theyre polar opposites. Nice one-liner though.   The ~~Chinese~~ Russian foreign propaganda arm is out in force today.
t1_du8mrn1	0	*	Gotta have a balanced news diet and bring a critical eye to everything. With other outlets it's often one of rush to publish and missing out, with Wikipedia it's one of omission. There is no oracle. 
t1_dswupni	1	*	Oh yeah, its understandable. Just dont pretend somehow you are living in the land of the free. You are not. Its a ridiculous claim that makes you look stupid to the rest of the world.
t1_du02cey	0	*	Why compromise with those who would see me with a boot on my neck?
t1_dsabqb7	1	*	And what rope are you saying has been extended to them?  Saying you can do it?
t1_dsa13hx	1	*	Thats fair though now I am curious about what specific crimes get attached to it.  Littering? Biological terrorism? Pollution?
t1_dt0exb2	0	*	You tried to contribute then when you weren't instantly lauded for your incorrect pedantics exploded into this thin-skinned firestorm of passive aggression. Just take the L and move on with your life.
t1_dt0f1rh	1	*	It really doesn't though.
t1_dsht28o	0	*	I don't think automation is the only thing taking  the jobs though. I do think it's a part of it, but I don't think Detroit died out because of automation
t1_dv3oare	0	*	Dude dont play dumb. You cant fucking trick people, they arent as stupid as you think.
t1_dsf1hsc	0	*	Im not sure its a problem as the two most prominent imperialistic powers (US and Russia) are self sufficient. 
t1_dshp93b	1	*	Oh, so it's more about you not understanding what a Vassal is.
t1_du2ncgv	0	*	You're going to find that everywhere. We, humans, are imperfect.
t1_dt1emny	0	*	They've been pretty spot on, actually.
t1_dunvomo	1	*	Fair enough.
t1_duap1sm	1	*	Ah, well, hope all is well out there!
t1_dtfitk1	0	*	It's already been explained to you by the person who made the comment. You seemed to reject their explanation and proceeded to call them pathetic. Not really sure what else can be said to clarify.
t1_dud3z3i	0	*	Bit hypocritical aren't you?  Also, you don't know how to tell the time.  Projecting maybe?
t1_dsyk1oa	1	*	Yeah, I don't get it. What?
t1_dut6edy	0	*	A candidate has to be exciting to get people to vote for them. Clinton wasn't. I can't actually think of a less exciting candidate in my lifetime. 
t1_duteert	1	*	Ok so you're just a troll. Move along people, ignore him.
t1_dusyphj	1	*	Yeah it happens all the time.
t1_dut922u	0	*	if they're even half as dangerous and all consuming as you think wouldn't they just rig it? I mean, I know you'd say they did rig it if Remain won.
t1_dutik92	1	*	It might not go hand in hand with your crippling insecurities.  
t1_dut50fe	1	*	Stay on topic.
t1_dut910k	1	*	Bookmarking this comment. Come November after the blue wave, I can't wait to hear all you idiots screech while the GOP becomes irrelevant.

t1_dut22t6	1	*	Enlighten me then.
t1_dv2cux7	1	*	You'd seriously be surprised, on Reddit at least 
t1_dskafu5	1	*	Everything is the same.
t1_dsl67y0	1	*	That's fantastic :-)
t1_dskk9d9	1	*	fair enough
t1_dskg8iu	1	*	Agreed. I voted for Hillary, but I goddamn hated myself doing it. Still do a little. 
t1_dskc5tk	1	*	I'd say if your entire platform involves autocratic genocide, yeah, we can just rule that one out.   Quit with the fucking horseshoe theory bullshit. 
t1_dsk8su8	0	*	You can't possibly believe this. The couple hundred extra dollars most Americans get back in their returns will not come close to outweighing the increase in healthcare premiums. 
t1_dski6zt	0	*	Its a cooling system. No joke. There are pipes from the wind tunnel turbines i believe running under the lake. 
t1_dsk7u2b	0	*	what an absolute moron
t1_dskowfh	0	*	Probably an employee.
t1_dskbs1u	1	*	fair enough  i do bring it up often  just so much hypocrisy on this site, whether its israel or not

t1_dsktb39	0	*	Whoops, you're right, I got my years mixed up.
t1_dtcmq2v	0	*	Whether it's yours or not, it's silly dogma, not remotely serious history. You spoke categorically; you were wrong. 
t1_dtbxdzt	0	*	Yeah,  I've read the Wikipedia page now and it seems like school shootings are classified as such when they happen at schools,  regardless of circumstances. 
t1_dtcbikr	0	*	I think the US funded Afghani insurgents against the Soviets first. The US really needs to stop funding and supporting groups like that.
t1_dtbx8ux	1	*	Man, you're fighting a losing battle here.  This dude's made up his mind and no amount of reasonable debate is going to change it.
t1_dtc0xgi	1	*	Oh shit... Oh... Shit. 
t1_dtc53cg	0	*	I edited my comment, having realized your asinine disparagement was about Redditors only, not millenials in general. My point, however, stands. 
t1_dtbym0i	0	*	Jesus Christ. Really, dude?

t1_duf1ziy	1	*	Black Mirror flashback right there.
t1_dtdige5	1	*	Just dont lose your head with nuclear power. 
t1_dtm415w	1	*	*A direct result of labor.   This is the same as saying that a peasant was stupid for wanting more rights because they were using tools that feudalism created.
t1_dtm3v3t	0	*	he just continued to do what Batista did LOL except for that small part about him not handing over all of Cuba's wealth to rich businessmen. BUT OH, THE GDP WAS GOOD.  You should work for CIA.
t1_dtzmkc8	0	*	It wasn't clearly a joke. Clear jokes don't need explanations. he was 100% serious.
t1_dtzehdn	1	*	No, because it is Canada commanding our love, not the other way around. 
t1_dtz1755	0	*	Never been there.  But good on you for being a decent person. Maybe *you* should try going there yourself. Because honestly, you're probably usually like this.
t1_dtz4lex	0	*	That was very clearly sarcasm. You're not really all that good at basic social interaction, are you lad? 
t1_du0dasp	0	*	There was no harassment. Telling a joke on stage isn't fucking harassment, get that through your fascist skull. 
t1_du0sp9b	1	*	You wouldn't even clarify a statement?
t1_dtyy2rq	1	*	You provide a hollow, empty argument.
t1_dtztddx	0	*	And I'm telling you that you're the one making a claim and you need to put the effort in if you want me to watch it, which clearly you don't you just want to seem smart.
t1_dtyzbrc	1	*	The part he didn't get hired for
t1_du63qzg	0	*	> what's described in  if fully believable and reasonable.  Oh no, not 's artwork.
t1_duqxfn5	1	*	Incredibly unsatisfying. Like bread with no butter.
t1_durk2da	0	*	Please stop loling and lmaoing at your own jokes. I am interested in this discussion and it's not helping matters at all. 
t1_duqq3k2	1	*	I hope too, and I am def going to be more involved than ever before in my life.  
t1_duqjgj4	0	*	Depends on how much it uses it's teeth.
t1_duqwbez	0	*	It was a joke based on right wing hysteria. I can't take anybody's gun away - I don't have any way to do so, nor would I want to.  I mean, geez, they've got guns. They'd shoot me if I tried.
t1_duqplr9	1	*	Or dams.
t1_dv1e0p6	0	*	not as incompetent as the politicians of the last 60 years. fearful whites? sorry, try again. you're reaching at straws.
t1_duqr07g	1	*	Wow. People must have felt demoralized just like we do now.  I don't know if that helps or not tbh.
t1_dtqetnu	0	*	Not going to read this either. You really like wasting your time. It's like you don't understand the words nothing you can say or do will change it.
t1_du04m0q	1	*	Thanks for the answers! What a strange, interesting place. 
t1_dtokzx4	0	*	Well to me the legality is all that matters, as it stands its legal to do, if its a problem then vote and do what good citizens do and try to change the system youre unhappy with.
t1_dtofbx8	0	*	So dhow did you confirm all his victims were immigrants?
t1_dton4j0	1	*	Thanks. 
t1_dtoleuw	0	*	Yes, because I see that as a transgression against me. Are you comparing a person entering someone's home without permission with a refugee?
t1_dtotcgm	1	*	Europa gefxe4llt mir sehr!  Natxfcrlich findet man Rassismus xfcberall, leider.  Die meisten xd6sterreicher die ich getroffen habe sind sicher nett und vorurteile nicht.  Danke!
t1_dtp1we4	0	*	cant agree with that - just too much oversimplification and false equivalency.
t1_dtotg7i	0	*	Again, dumb shit, since you have to go full blown racist, is why your comment can't be taken seriously.  
t1_dtoohl8	1	*	Here in Aus it's a given, can't feed the government if we take to many sick days 
t1_dtp2wi5	1	*	Which was the whole point of total war, wasn't it?
t1_dtoyz9k	1	*	What are you trying to say here?
t1_dtom1wm	0	*	Little-known fact: if you say the phrase quite easily done when writing QED at the end of a proof, anyone who hears you is legally allowed to punch you in the face with no retribution.
t1_dtozv19	1	*	Freed by Sherman you mean. 
t1_dtorez1	0	*	I don't know. I mean, I suppose any excuse is good enough if you're a racist, neo-fascist thug and want to shoot some people.
t1_dtomrnp	1	*	I'm not saying that he killed her.  I don't know if he killed her or not, but i know he chopped up the body.  
t1_dtofbu8	1	*	Sure it is. Just don't expect different reactions as when flying the ~~swastika~~ sunwheel flag.
t1_dtowq88	1	*	That's really bad logic. Unlimited force response to any provocation?  Do you argue for glassing the middle east over 9/11? 
t1_dtpi0uc	1	*	It does not but.. sure. 
t1_dtotawh	0	*	5 bucks says he mentions something about college admissions or affirmative action.
t1_dtd8ucf	0	*	lol. you make a claim, and demand i give sources.   i can see why youre a socialist now. youre reasoning/logic  skills are shittier than a porta potty at a construction site 
t1_dt3ucjp	1	*	 You just have to look at eco protests, like Dakota pipeline to know how American media works. I agree with you. 
t1_dtwb7fx	0	*	You are putting words in my mouth.  It doesn't follow at all according to the article this post is about.  Maybe you should go watch some TV for awhile.
t1_dtucar4	0	*	No they can't. Stop lying dude.  Christ, this is easily verifiable. You're terrible.
t1_dturux1	0	*	No, but that isn't the question here. I'm assuming you conveniently forget Assange's state actor comment, just for one example.
t1_dsdcmhp	1	*	Can you please provide a link of me saying what you attributed to me? Or you can apologize. You know, whichever is easier.
t1_dtgnk4o	1	*	Nailed it.
t1_dv2jrj7	0	*	That is a good response. The NRA should have said something like that if that was what they were thinking too. I suspect that they were not though. 
t1_dv3t1my	1	*	, the UK, Italy, etc.
t1_dv2wucy	1	*	You most certainly do buddy
t1_dv2dkrg	0	*	Is it discrimination, or is it correcting for discrimination? If white people are over-represented, how would it be physically possible to correct for that otherwise?
t1_dv2t96s	0	*	That is the problem with only getting your news from late night comedians.  Try listening to what the opposition actually says and not what your side said the opposition said.
t1_dv5x6gv	0	*	> You can just go buy a P90, just not a full auto one.  By definition, that's not a P90, then.
t1_dujyxfj	0	*	So your solution is socialism?
t1_dujy0ge	1	*	Hopefully some sunlight leaks through the blinds in your internet research agency because every human needs some sunlight.
t1_dujnmxp	1	*	lol 3,000,000 fewer votes is somehow murdering? The 8th smallest Electoral College victory in history is murdering?   Please. 
t1_dujt25f	1	*	That wasn't...I...  Wow.   So examples have to be one to one literal for you, huh? 
t1_dukeiv4	1	*	this is also true. there is some amount of truth in the premise, it is based on waaaaaaay too many assumptions for it to actually be useful
t1_dujro34	1	*	Wut?
t1_dulih97	0	*	Lol youre clearly way more insecure. Just stop and take the lesson you learned today. You could say thank you too if you want. 
t1_dujyf8k	0	*	Not really, no.
t1_dujl4s8	0	*	Neither will becoming homeless.
t1_dukikz8	1	*	Oh wow, I was wrong here.  I thought it said what about the fake dossier.
t1_duk58jb	1	*	Thanks for the detailed response
t1_dtk87gk	1	*	The origins, cause, methods, effects and motivations are all different. What would you argue is so similar about the two, other than the name?
t1_dtjn9ww	0	*	More drivel I see.
t1_dtjdnkt	1	*	> My time doing public debates tells me that changing someone's mind is largely about emotional investment  Amen brother! you understood all along. 
t1_dtk1uyd	1	*	Haha. Heard a joke years ago about used mattresses feeling like cornflakes...came hear to say that. Mine feels like mattress...mostly.
t1_dtk2ego	0	*	not really like most of the world's men im happy my dick wasn't cut up and i get to enjoy it more than those that were cut also
t1_dtj7ef1	1	*	Mine is perfectly fine. No dryness, it's not scaly, and it's not dry. It's almost like you have no idea what you are talking about... 
t1_dtlkmne	0	*	Oh well, since you don't have a preference I guess that means no woman does despite all the polls that say different.  
t1_dtnjczq	0	*	Yep. It's seeping with hypocrisy.
t1_dtk4qcr	1	*	The point is valid, though. Whether you remember it or not is irrelevant to whether it's right to do.
t1_dtjxjbi	1	*	Not really, if your argument is 'so what? They don't remember it'  Zz
t1_dtjjr0e	1	*	Btw a minority of people in the world are circumcised. It might be a majority of Americans but its not a majority of people
t1_du5cpmx	0	*	I speak AMERICAN and while you're on this website you speak AMERICAN too.

t1_dv0lr8w	1	*	r/woosh
t1_dv02poi	0	*	But what if youth want to identify as a certain gender?
t1_dv0akkw	0	*	So you're okay with handguns, which are used in 97% of gun homicides, but not long guns, which are used in 3% of gun homicides (automatics in under 1%)? Just clearing that up.
t1_dv1pptq	0	*	We don't have mandatory curfews during storms, so why would we ban long guns? Neither is actually very helpful in the scope of national health and well-being.

t1_dua15vj	0	*	Not gonna engage with a person who's not willing to listen.
t1_dv1csi9	1	*	Except your story doesn't really add up here. The places that voted leave were generally more rural and had less diverse populations compared to places like London which voted remain.
t1_dv1dg7s	0	*	Ok you are a troll. Good job.
t1_dv0svvl	1	*	Lol that includes officer misfires.  Total jokemon of a statistic.

t1_dv1108q	0	*	>  I'll fix my post to say it's using a definition of 4 casualties  You're going to be removing like 90% of the mass shootings you listed then, because most of them don't have 4 casualties.
t1_dv18tin	1	*	Oh my god. Why wouldnt the scrolling stop.
t1_dv0wujc	1	*	At most the top 10 seed companies own 75% of the market. That is not a monopoly, and farmers have choices.   So let me repeat. No its not.

t1_dv0vipo	1	*	I volunteer as tribute
t1_dv1xgs3	1	*	Awesome points, I shall keep this in mind!
t1_du98k7i	1	*	Yeah, and that reason is lobbyism and corruption. I'm pretty sure my tax bureau's official smartphone app is faster and easier than whatever it is you're paying $20 for.

t1_du8nxvr	1	*	I don't mind a challenge, but I wasn't making an argument.  If you disagree, then don't read what I have to say.  Or you can simply block me.  Here, I'll demonstrate.  
t1_dugf4h0	1	*	I agree. People who say Trumps gonna start WW3 over Twitter are retarded. If you launch nukes at the most powerful nation just because their leader said some shit, your no worse than him.
t1_dugjeja	0	*	I generally talk to a lot of Europeans on the regular. It's amazing the people you mean playing MMOs. We chat on a daily basis on Teamspeak.
t1_dugqd0b	1	*	Nothing's a big deal when everything's a big deal.
t1_duglaun	1	*	Not for long. Once Putin's policies go into full effect in the US we will all be eating shit sandwiches.
t1_du1c2d0	0	*	Trust a liberal to double-down on rape culture.    What happened to no means no?  Go back and read the original joke.
t1_du19pqx	1	*	 But the only chance you have to change that is too get off your ass and vote. That's the first step.   Good luck America... sincerely I hope you guys can survive this.

t1_dsn3xzm	1	*	That's because you've just woken up. Go back to sleep.
t1_dsmu95u	0	*	California is on the giving end of socialism. WV is on the receiving end.   Theres also privatize the profits, socialize the losses.  So, tell me again how we dont have some form of socialism...

t1_dssf6ab	0	*	A fantastic copy and paste comment mate, but if you're arguing there is zero difference between a Chinese man and a Ghanaian man then you have true issues.
t1_dsn1cug	1	*	Gareth, Indiana. 
t1_du31crv	0	*	Seems like it. There was an interview with the Israeli ambassador were its all laid out pretty nicely. She admits to having no problem with the law and only attacking it on instructions from Israel.

t1_ds4ar69	1	*	I'll pack the bags!
t1_ds498jj	1	*	My guess is we start aligning ourselves with the lizards and start to call Trump a toad person and then hear frog croaking in place of all the lyrics in our music for the next 4 hours. 
t1_ds466dr	0	*	We did that last election.
t1_ds4bkrp	0	*	I beg to differ but I don't require affirmation from internet strangers.  Is it that important to you? Do you require someone to say good things to you 24/7?

t1_ds44hba	0	*	But drugs are always the answer!
t1_ds46k33	0	*	Yes you nincompoop, your argument is pathetic. If it was up to black Americans, Trump wouldn't be here. The same can be said for literally every minority group.

t1_dv24v4f	0	*	Good to hear. I have not heard of Barrell Bourbon. I'll have to look it up.
t1_dv22b3t	0	*	Sure.  Most of reddit want to blame him for all the problems while not giving him any credit.  Let him have this one victory on the other side of the world.  
t1_dv22p6t	1	*	Fair enough
t1_dv1xecv	0	*	The guy who lead the birther movement is president. Fuck positivity. Im mad.

t1_dv3ssty	1	*	Can't it be both? 
t1_dv24rij	0	*	Uh...you guys voted like 48% for that kid diddler. So fair assumptions to make of alabama.
t1_dv2ver4	1	*	A combined total of maybe, maybe tops 20,000 people world wide. Great example dipshit.
t1_dv1y9uw	1	*	They are interested in having someone in power who will generally support their interests. It's much more open ended, which is what makes it more dangerous.
t1_dv26onz	1	*	I haven't exactly followed the story but I doubt it is sorted yet. I learned about it like a week ago and supposedly it was going to take a few weeks to a few months to fix. 
t1_dv1t56p	1	*	We do.  I will send you a PM.  
t1_dv3amnt	0	*	Over the past week it is down ~10% which is literally decimated. The past week was when articles about steel tariffs first started circulating and hence when the market began to price it in.
t1_dv1srbw	1	*	Interestingly enough, those against entering the war ran on America First.

t1_dt0igm3	0	*	She still killed a person, though. That kind of thing doesn't go unpunished, and taking the law in your own hands isn't ever good. 
t1_dt0p9vp	0	*	She is still guilty for taking matters into her own hand.
t1_dt0uuds	1	*	I am retarded excuse me
t1_dt0z9tk	1	*	I agree with that and I think it's a poor mindset to have. Yet, sadly, also a predominant one.
t1_dugddkm	0	*	A lot of what he said he would do hasn't happened yet. Not only because he hasn't tried, but because when he has tried to do some things, it is blocked. 
t1_dughguf	0	*	Of course it is.  It was your bigoted use of the term Zionist I had an issue with.  Have a nice day, I'm not interested having discourse with blatant racists. 
t1_dugdop4	0	*	Take in a homeless or immigrant into your own home. It's just 1 more mouth to feed and you have a moral obligation to help those in need.

t1_du088se	0	*	Thats an answer to how and not why.
t1_dtzly9t	0	*	This is a hilariously bad take. So, your alternative is having Senators submit legislation based on their own thoughts, opinions, assumptions, and worldview?  That sounds like a wonderful idea.
t1_dtzvv3h	0	*	That's why you visit them to see if they raise animals ethically. My CSA allows you to visit and take a tour of the farms at any time and ask any questions you have.
t1_dtzl3ck	0	*	> science has already taken care of that... I've researched it heavily.  logical fallacies, presumption. Best of luck with developing your arguments.

t1_dtztcab	0	*	So how does that give an ought? Like you can say I can understand why someone would rape, therefore it should be okay? Or what do you mean? 
t1_du0iisa	0	*	Ok, well here is the definition of harm according to Merriam-Webster: Harm - Physical or mental damage. That easily suffices for why eating animals is harmful. 
t1_du01nxu	1	*	Even the Cancer Society in meat loving New Zealand is recommending a reduction in the consumption of red meat due to the link between heme iron and cancer. Bowel cancer is a big killer here.

t1_dtepmq2	0	*	So you really think that we should ask each animal how would they prefer to be killed?

t1_dtnunl5	0	*	It's not necessarily your opinion, just how you wrote it that's cringy as fuck 
t1_dtn73yh	0	*	Ah yes, I forget that people don't vote in this country. Regardless, I wouldn't call 63 million Americans indecent just based on who they voted for. 
t1_dtnhs23	1	*	That is a totally legitimate argument if the budget they have is $0.
t1_dtnldqb	1	*	So it would have been all fine and dandy if Trump put small sanctions on Russia?

t1_dsjyubf	0	*	>The New York Times also reported last year that Trump said immigrants from Haiti have AIDS. The White House denied that report.  Again with the anonymous sources
t1_dsjvpew	0	*	I don't give a fuck. The people of Charlottesville showed up for the statue, not to hear Richard Spencer. 
t1_dsk0ove	1	*	Simply a recommendation, friendo. Not a generalization. Learn what hypocrisy details so you dont end up looking silly again in the future. 
t1_dsjwfh2	0	*	Happy cake day
t1_dsk0cxr	0	*	I remember when people like you said the war in Afghanistan was about a natural gas pipeline.  Edit: Oh shit: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/TurkmenistanAfghanistanPakistanIndia_Pipeline
t1_dslu5oc	1	*	Ok.
t1_dsl0oti	0	*	You used the term unprofessional to describe this incident.   What are your specific criticisms of this administration? How do you think the President should respond to this incident?

t1_dsk8gnx	0	*	First your problem was per capital GDP now it's GDP in general.  Way to move the goal posts.
t1_dsk3ltm	1	*	There is a difference between painting them all the same vs pointing out common driving factors behind support for him.
t1_dsk6aq9	0	*	lol yeah Sargon is a nazi, fuck you idiot
t1_dska7n7	1	*	I get that - I'm a few years older and we used to say it, too. The dude I responded to said he and his friends *still* say it, and that he *refuses* to stop, which is just weird.

t1_dsk5cfx	0	*	maybe you should put down the bong and enroll, little guy.
t1_dsjz6zp	0	*	Yeah, so was Israel's. Also their wall is probably the most criticized structure in the entire world. If you want to compare apples and oranges, I'll just throw a lemon in the mix too. 
t1_dsjz39z	0	*	Well I'm looking for the evidence that entrepreneurship is the main economic driver.  I enjoyed the articles but didn't see that claim..?
t1_dskvz46	1	*	Thanks for the correction! :)   It sure is surreal that two banks can pony up $50k and suddenly citizens are ready to sign their taxes away. 
t1_dsk79d3	0	*	Respect of our force is all that matters. The world eats up our culture anyway. We rule.
t1_dsjumj1	0	*	Not when it's put into context, no. 
t1_dsjwoa0	1	*	Some things will never change.
t1_dsjyw7f	0	*	That's not what he said, nor defended. You're assuming that because he agrees with the countries being shitholes, he agrees with Trump's immigration policies. Different conversations.
t1_dsl0cfi	1	*	I was originally commenting as someone said Norway doesn't have mass shootings when they had the worst one. Sardonic irony right there.
t1_dts834x	0	*	The quotation marks for 'no longer necessary' and 'we are full' as examples   I didn't say any of those things, who are you quoting?????
t1_dts9rvf	1	*	Wow, you are very good at making arguments.
t1_dsgp6rj	1	*	That's rape in most jurisdictions
t1_dta464j	0	*	Which part
t1_dt0vjz6	0	*	Yeah. Neither party is capable. It's a disgrace honestly.
t1_dt63leo	1	*	Oh you're right. Odd that it's phrased this way then.  That's what I get for assuming...
t1_dt5wp1j	1	*	I can't tell that from the wiki article.. how do you know?

t1_dtqdz32	1	*	gotchu fam 
t1_dtqyk27	1	*	Yes. I think she's done some good work in her time in government. I don't agree with all of what she's done, but for the most part she has been a force for positive change.
t1_dthlnlt	0	*	Because your comments in this thread, specifically responding to other posters, are nonsensical. 
t1_ds5z3mz	0	*	Is the constitution used any differently in Sweden?  In the USA the constitution just allows laws, or parts of laws to be ruled void by a constitutional court.
t1_ds62t9l	1	*	See: Torah, Bible, Quran
t1_ds63oje	0	*	Yes, but that's a bit before our time.

t1_ds6a9ty	1	*	Uhm...did raptor just forget to switch accounts? 
t1_ds6tdqr	1	*	Yes, people other than yourself. Which is being lazy by relying on others so you don't have to parent properly. What point are you trying to make exactly?
t1_ds6x7du	0	*	Where are the angels who will be separating the wheat from the chaff for us mere mortals?
t1_dulsfpa	1	*	Using 1st/2nd/3rd world at all is outdated. Now I believe it is more accurate to use LEDC and MEDC (less/more economically developed country
t1_dul3gxf	0	*	But why, they don't pay taxes? 
t1_dsd5jcu	1	*	Well, they usually top so probably not.
t1_dty8gmf	1	*	Depends if you count federal land. Grand Canyon National park follows DST as well. 
t1_dty4dim	1	*	Ha, that's awesome. 
t1_dtyanea	0	*	Agreed.  ...and for new systems it's less of a problem.  But the world runs on old systems, not new ones.
t1_dty1c8p	0	*	No you can't. A huge part of why workers start early is to get their equipment from the yard to the work site before the commuters get on the road.

t1_dufzpm8	1	*	Germany, Brexit, then they fiddlefuck with their bully military -- enemy awfully god damn close. Need big spank cry like little baby.
t1_duekow3	0	*	But in an international terminal in Europe, Interpol couldn't arrest someone wanted for a crime who was just *passing through* Europe? I can't believe it.

t1_dueflcc	0	*	That's not remotely the same thing as being everyone's enemy.
t1_dueruuj	1	*	> while the nukings are most likely to raise even more hatred against the invading force  It worked with Japan. Why wouldn't it work with Russia?
t1_duelysf	0	*	You'd end up a murder victim either way.  In this instance you're more of a threat.  Or you could Walk away and then threaten them at range.
t1_dufjomz	0	*	He absolutely disrespects us. He only uses us as political tools to gain votes.  Any veteran who supports trump, beyond their obligation to him as CIC, has betrayed his brothers.
t1_dv13gzm	0	*	The time you saved by not proofreading could have been spent poking your head out of the CNN / NBC bubble. Hope you made it worthwhile.
t1_dtlqmyb	0	*	No I dont have a subscription to the source site unfortunately. The other one just says he did it.
t1_duqo6pl	0	*	No. What lead you to that conclusion? It's from the period while Yanukovych was still in power.
t1_dt5mfec	1	*	Do you remember the Hall terrorists :) We should make a list of all those pathetic state practices
t1_dt3z7qz	0	*	Well, yeah, those are pretty good options, all things considered.  Your options however include either starting a WW3 or sucking on US dick.
t1_due44n5	0	*	So the words of the Deputy Attorney General for the United States Department of Justice are just my thoughts, gottcha
t1_due45y8	1	*	Thank you, it's refreshing to have had an exchange with you. Politics are a touchy subject and it can be hard to have a constructive conversation even if your intentions aren't negative.
t1_dteo84c	0	*	Mmhmm, did you also ignore 90% of the other comments in this chain? Whats irrelevant is your fake ignorance
t1_dv0mc03	0	*	So you flat out refuse to post evidence to refute mine. Thanks for playing. Weak as piss

t1_dv0lkuh	0	*	Prove my sources wrong bitch.
t1_dv0miuf	1	*	I never claimed he wasn't. I claimed that he confessed to murder and pays online trolls to pretend he has vast support. Are you fucking 7?
t1_dux3uu2	1	*	Yeah I just found those. I didn't check before posting. Oh well.  See my edit.
t1_ducuxoo	1	*	I hear the only place you're ever invited is outside.
t1_dt1a45l	0	*	Except that wasn't happening during the time I was talking about. Keep talking out your ass though. 
t1_dt0cbl7	0	*	You are telling me that if they were poor englishmen they wouldve let the same thing happen. I doubt it.
t1_dskm7c7	0	*	 I'm not, you go Google Nazi Germany's economy and report back. Even if they'd taken the continent they couldn't hold it against France and England once they mobilised their colonial possessions.
t1_dsk3sx8	1	*	For King and Country
t1_dseyz3q	1	*	I use a fully charged quartz crystal.

t1_dti9iyp	0	*	I was quoting one of the sections that could apply to Trump while not being hampered by that Judicial Proceeding part.
t1_dtj7m3z	0	*	The right is state propaganda funneling down to protect their power. These are facts. The left and the media dont have power.   You must love North korea you'd fit right in.  
t1_duqrao2	1	*	No worries.  Happens to me all the time.
t1_duqqfia	0	*	Doubtful.  Have you ever been there?
t1_duqwa0t	1	*	Really then most wars don't happen. If Congress say yes then it's way more hands off.  I doubt you want that.
t1_dtlhpzq	1	*	and I literally gave him the link, and he was happy.  the confusion was he thought it was from the retarded indian news article.    why would I need to make an argument?  the link speaks for it self.

t1_dudf1hu	1	*	He hasnt been linked with TD or anything but there were pics of him in a #MAGA hat on his social media and stuff. So thats probably what they were alluding to. 
t1_dud5uee	0	*	Thanks for admitting it.  Where do you think Steele went to get the information the DNC paid for?  Starts with a R.  Again Im using your standard for Collusion.
t1_dudelcq	0	*	Yeah including subversion of the Russian people's will if the Russian government so chooses. I think I'd rather have free speech of the people and press.

t1_duus433	0	*	Why?  I find both equally repugnant, just at slightly different level.  I see no reason to bring up any differences for the point of argument.  Neither view is acceptable.

t1_du62ljq	1	*	Use soft serve. Problem solved.
t1_ds64aod	0	*	I don't think material gain directly translates into things being better. Just look at the future depicted in Black Mirror for examples of how things can be bad despite everyone having a lot of stuff.
t1_ds65i3s	0	*	I don't know why people downvote anything to do with socialism. Seems to work well for the Scandinavian countries...  I think people think there's communism or nothing. Moderate socialism works...

t1_dtmr7b0	0	*	I didn't straw man at all. If you weren't implying what I assumed you were implying, there would be no reason for you to respond at all.

t1_dthreka	0	*	Ummmm thats a little unnecessary. Did they hit to close to home for ya, pal?
t1_dthfdt5	1	*	Hey man you are the one insisting that Mueller is somehow a leftist agenda leader here.  Burden is on you for detailing your madness.

t1_dsspwwq	0	*	Furthermore, looking into your account, you seemingly like to create memes surrounding both Mao and Stalin, both some of the top killers of human in the century.
t1_dssns9w	0	*	Thank you! Its so easy for people to be in denial, but when information comes out most people change their mind at least somewhat.
t1_dstc4qb	0	*	Well over here in filthy socialist Europe we've got plenty of the same liberties, even some you don't have! Like not getting shot by the police constantly, we only get smacked around with batons ;)

t1_dsmpjvu	0	*	People we're still doing it before him though because of the *Good Book*.  Adam Ruins Everything completely leaves out the Bible/Torah and makes it seem like no one was doing this before Dr. Kellogg.

t1_dth82zg	0	*	I really doubt that congress is going to cut spending. Heck, the president wants to spend billions on a border wall and billions more on an infrastructure bill. 
t1_dtgpdml	1	*	It's a very well defined form of a very long known form of phallacy (tu quoque).
t1_dtgl054	1	*	I can blame both. 
t1_dtgprbj	1	*	And she won the popular vote... lets not forget that either
t1_dtjfme7	0	*	To de-escalate, we'd both have to concede something to the other side.  In our case, what are you suggesting? Ignore their attempts to influence our election? 
t1_dtgg1x2	1	*	How long into the term did they get before they were accused?
t1_dtgqmjp	1	*	Well the issue with that is that the people who want guns and own enough of them, are the same people who seem to be very happy with our government in its current state :/
t1_dtgjcyq	1	*	Australians love a democracy sausage 
t1_dtgpw7c	1	*	Liberals wouldnt bring it up so much if trump supporters didnt do it all the time.

t1_dtgo40f	1	*	No, who? Serious question.
t1_dtgw8xu	0	*	You really think the military would follow trump over congress?

t1_dtwytem	0	*	Im not making a point about UBI though.  I suppose what I really should have said is WORKERS are happiest and most productive when finanically secure.
t1_dtvydp9	0	*	This is just that area? Very large skewing of the average vs median there. I smell rich people... 
t1_dtwfkzh	1	*	That really only happens at peak, though. So it's kind of expected considering the volume they're trying to move. The rest of the year is pretty tame comparatively.
t1_dtvvwpd	1	*	Sounds crazy lol. I rent a decent house for about $700, but I'm looking at buying a house with a mortgage and the monthly repayments should be closer to $500. 
t1_dtw39qp	0	*	Thats a hell of a false equivalence and a straw man. I never said I didnt like public service, I said I didnt like **you** Obama was the leader of the free world. You, you, are nothing even close.

t1_duuj4u9	1	*	I fart in your general direction. 
t1_dutl9hl	1	*	I used to fart as a kid, I always thought I could give up anytime I wanted. It ruined me and now when I let one rip I start thinking of all the Seahorses Ive killed. Fucking humans are so shellfish.

t1_dtrzyoc	0	*	Hmm not even close to the level of Trump hate.  He is a populist and fairly popular.  If he wasn't term limited he most likely gets reelected by a fairly large margin.  Trump not so much.
t1_du8sr41	1	*	Mexican isnt a race. Theyre foreign nationals entering and staying in my country illegally. Tell me any other country that tolerates this, including Mexico. 
t1_dub2cwi	1	*	Me too.... I'd rather be playing video games but I keep getting distracted by all this depressing philosophy.
t1_du98qv9	1	*	ditto

t1_dstp4q3	0	*	You underestimate just how much power merchants could have. 
t1_dthul4l	1	*	Dude that email is harmless. It's taking about someone who's bringing their kids and having something fun for them to do so they aren't just bored there. This is ridiculous.

t1_dtezphx	0	*	Are you under the impression that women aren't yet useful members of society? But could be if lifted out of oppression like blacks? 
t1_dtfdhnn	0	*	Just because people make choices doesn't mean those choices aren't influenced by things. Cultural beliefs imposed on women are an unnecessary, harmful influence.

t1_du2axn5	0	*	Unless you're working under the table you likely signed a release to run a background/credit check before starting employment. Even thegig economy jobs require that.
t1_du2s0i9	0	*	Perhaps I did the same. 
t1_du29ve4	0	*	No, because they still have jobs and bank accounts.
t1_du2uksx	1	*	Customer trust is only important when the product/service is voluntary.  We, at no point, hadnt a say in whether Equifax got our info, they just did.   They dont give a shit about customer trust.

t1_duwpyd9	0	*	Doctors do.  And my point was that it's not why our healthcare is expensive. Well relatively speaking, it's cheaper than in the US.
t1_dux4t8o	1	*	Alright have fun existing like every other average person. Did that hurt your feelings less?
t1_duxf4tr	1	*	I think that context it was a sensationalized term that was referring to long waitlists where Veterans died before receiving treatment.   See CNN article posted by u/Diesel_Daddy above. 
t1_duxnty0	1	*	Idk man, if I were hiring someone, I'd rather have someone that felt like their old job want a good for over someone that was deemed unfit

t1_du8w62s	0	*	Are you talking to me or did you reply to the wrong person? Because none of what you said has anything to do with what I said.
t1_duagxx9	1	*	I agree. Executing 2000+ people a year is also insane.
t1_du7so0w	0	*	Well it's definitely misleading as it only tells half of the story. So he's definitely correct about that. If you were to read only the headline, you wouldn't be well informed.

t1_dt28rfd	1	*	Overpopulation isn't the problem. The problem is that resources are finite. When you have more people to spread a finite amount of resources too every individual person has less.

t1_duj63nw	0	*	Who hurt you that you need to hate others just for being different?
t1_duj46nt	1	*	Yup and they went after them after saying they wouldn't. The Ogden memo was a big thing at the time. It was 09 and he immediately disregarded it.
t1_dujfmt7	1	*	Depends on their tip policy. Usually they get at least their fair share. And since they don't rely on tips and agreed to the tip policy it's fair to assume everyone is satisfied with this arrangement.

t1_dsv65qi	0	*	Its funny because its easier to immigrate here than to the European countries you want to be
t1_dsvft49	1	*	And as I said, even today, the number of jobs is growing, not shrinking.  Technology does remove some low skill jobs, true.  It also turns some previously high-skilled jobs into now low-skilled jobs.

t1_dtf0a23	1	*	> a surgical strike against Kim Jung Un  This is the most optimal option but there's too much collateral risk at this point. Kim's military will retaliate in full if he's killed.
t1_dtczzjg	0	*	Yup that's what I said. Can you highlight the part where I lauded the US?
t1_dsfait4	0	*	The Powers That Were -above- hold an unrecognized legal presence in foreign countries. xa0The US simply dis-acknowledges such dual citizens-status.
t1_dstjw7v	0	*	I think it is some people in the middle choosing to vote democrat, and some GOP voting third party.  I believe 538 has done more in depth analysis on exactly what the trends are.

t1_dtl5l9j	0	*	Canada would be invaded if they tried to invite hostile troops, they're smart enough not to do that. In military terms, Canada is state 51

t1_du5cray	0	*	> that doesnt necessarily apply to money laundering  Oh, it does apply to money laundering. That's why they made the law in the first place.
t1_du5tc60	1	*	I dont really give a shit what you think, youve proven more than once you lost this argument long ago. Keep trying though slugger, its cute. 
t1_du6pef8	1	*	I had no idea
t1_du5hzk7	0	*	You are just upset that your argument lacked the the evidence to back up your claims.
t1_du4je8n	1	*	Yes, but you know, homely.
t1_dsdjokq	0	*	Even though you're just making a joke reference, spreading your limbs slows you and increases the chance of a painful last few minutes as a disfigured lump on the ground.
t1_dsdgabt	1	*	You might be able to wink at the headsman though
t1_dsh6vlk	0	*	nowhere in the reddiquette does it say that reddit puts asterisks next to comments that are edited after 5 minutes. try again 
t1_ds2tymu	1	*	The tweets aren't policy, but they are recognized as official statements by POTUS
t1_dv0x4rl	1	*	Me too, I was in Krugersdorp in 2004. The social stratification was markedly different than that of USA (current) or UK (earlier).  
t1_du3ulhq	0	*	Yes it does. It sounds like rape AND statutory rape.  Geez... wasnt aware if these details.
t1_du3iu6x	1	*	Public opinion has always held its own court, and has always seemed to stay relatively independent from justice, barring some fuckups.
t1_du57s3h	1	*	Ahh that's right. Sorry it's been a really long time since I've seen it
t1_dv4i2ja	1	*	5/7 the perfect comeback, would pity again.

t1_dsmbdyf	1	*	nobody wants to be invaded or have a coup launched against you so you're put under a puppet dictator, no
t1_dtysh2d	1	*	o7
t1_dtwfb7n	1	*	Bend over, sounds like. If you won't use violence to protect yourself and your family,  you're a coward. 
t1_dv0zwor	0	*	Yes, we're not the biggest superpower in the world or anything. Obviously nothing here is working right.
t1_dv0mtt0	1	*	I honestly couldnt tell you! I think there are probably fewer people who think America pioneered free speech compared to the number of people who think America is the only place with free speech. 
t1_dv0qsw5	0	*	Yep, I do. You didn't answer my question. How exactly, in the context of this story, is what she did inciting hatred towards muslims?
t1_dvlgqqg	1	*	That's quite a leap from free speech to victims of crime. We can't censor free speech because some people don't know how to be adults or parents don't know how to restrict content from their children.
t1_dv1731d	0	*	What are you watching these days? I want to invest before the next Cruz leak
t1_dv0vmvz	1	*	Yes I know why she is being charged. I just don't agree that it's a good law. 
t1_dv12c65	0	*	Yeah we should cover our ears, close our eyes and sing happy songs. How is it not showing people a truth? ISIS does/did perpetuate this exact barbarity daily. 
t1_dv3rgdk	1	*	If it were such a shit show it seems like the above wouldnt be true. 
t1_dv0wg7a	0	*	Real deaths = fake deaths or virtual deaths.
t1_dv22nv0	1	*	No its not but thanks for being dramatic.
t1_dv16cx7	0	*	Good, I hope it hurt.
t1_dv2gmdr	0	*	Wait, what?  Twitter -itself- tends to ban accounts that push ISIS propaganda. Without any govt. asking.
t1_dv0sb2h	1	*	You have to log onto twitter yourself to see her tweets and then go find her twitter account. 
t1_dv1xd9u	0	*	No. Not in the US. And like I said, the way the internet works a recipient isn't being sent images, they are choosing to receive them.
t1_dv14wcc	0	*	So you think she was secretly shilling for them?
t1_dv0rha7	0	*	> Some beliefs are objectively wrong and it's okay to censor and oppress them.   Then half of the US population should be banned from commenting on the Internet.
t1_dv0z0gu	1	*	Yeah, imagine if we were all different and some people liked to watch their fellow man die horrible, gruesome deaths for entertainment and then try to normalize it by saying we're all different!
t1_dtvbxwc	1	*	\> SpaceX  \> Not a corporation
t1_dsjegdh	1	*	...... Can I get that house on suck my Dick Cheney avenue? The one with the ocean view!  
t1_dsi66qx	1	*	I disagree. See, easy.
t1_dsj8p4c	1	*	Say it outloud. That was as close as I could get with text.  *Just realized I needed another buh
t1_dsiqks9	0	*	I don't know about Russia controlling anything really. It's just become a over-stated lie so far. 
t1_dsht8wy	0	*	I am pretty sure there are multiple lewd island games out there. 
t1_dshrl9q	1	*	No.
t1_dshrj3d	0	*	Sounds like a happy ending to me
t1_dsitgm2	0	*	Same deal for white folks! Just maybe less staring.  Also, haggle everywhere. You don't get any respect if you don't.
t1_dshw0jq	1	*	Sounds like fun on a bun!
t1_dshsadj	1	*	so basically, we're back to the U.S in ~5 years.

t1_dshur9e	1	*	Was going to respond, but then you appeared and now I have nothing to say except this message commenting on it.
t1_dshuuxa	1	*	I love banging [hoors](https://youtube.com/watch?v=cKUkV0PmO40).
t1_dsc4gcx	1	*	> Why do people ask for citations for things that cannot possibly be cited to their satisfaction  Citation?
t1_duvhgm1	0	*	Ok, nevermind. Minorities are treated with the utmost equality and respect in America and there aren't massive swaths of blacks, natives, Latinos and women saying different.   My error.
t1_dtjdq0s	0	*	>they're just peacefully suing them.. see how it works?  I do, and I find it fucking hilariously ridiculous.

t1_dsshqws	0	*	loudmouth showoffs  interesting though if they did start doing that would it be a hate crime or terrorism? 
t1_du40xnt	0	*	Just telling you the facts bud. How do your tears taste?
t1_du4b6ms	0	*	You're lying.
t1_du46sr5	0	*	Neither of you guys have provided sources. Not saying you are wrong, would just like some evidence from both of you.
t1_du4oll3	1	*	Either the GOVERNMENT is spending more time in Puerto Rico, which the media will report on, or they're not.  Not much else the media needs to do except a quick blurb that says yep, still no power 
t1_du4h1wg	1	*	I think would say the same about his mom
t1_du4401w	0	*	That was a terrible argument. You're not even trying are you?
t1_du48d79	1	*	Yes, human nature is a fickle thing, but I think we could at least have a system that doesn't reward greedy exploitation of fellow humans.
t1_dttqr7x	0	*	It's literally the Alcubierre drive. Of course, that seems to require negative mass which has never been observed so...
t1_duoo1gq	0	*	But Star Fleet Academy is the only way to become a Star Fleet officer. If Harvard only has one pre-law club, it can't exclude women.

t1_du4npik	0	*	And he's just digging deeper by referring to unrelated things like Shengen. What a weirdo.
t1_dsbdhna	0	*	Dude I'm finished trying to argue with you and present you facts, you're fucking stupid, and wrong.
t1_duhlz9j	0	*	So being against authoritarianism = social engineering?    
t1_ds4qnpa	0	*	Jeez do I hope so, but I just don't know anymore. I thought T_D was satire, but it wasn't. I also thought LateStateCapitalism was satire, but it isn't. Who knows anymore.
t1_ds4uxgv	0	*	Was Stalin the President of the US? No? Then I don't see how anything you're talking about is relevant considering we're talking about the US. You are a dense one alright
t1_ds560fh	0	*	If you look at it terms of human lives saved by not having to invade mainland Japan, then it most certainly was a cost savings.
t1_ds4zkxs	1	*	Well, it's not justifiable, but it certainly adds a whole another level to the confrontation. People always think that's everything is black and white...but it's just not like that in real life. 
t1_ds6veh2	0	*	Hopefully not with people like you. Your bias is preventing you from looking at both sides of the issue. It's really sad
t1_ds4x24n	0	*	How would you handle over 2 million people?
t1_ds4s144	0	*	Commenting on Reddit, complaining, is not working. You might be at a job getting paid, but you're not working. That is lazy to 99% of society.
t1_ds4vrsu	1	*	That's not relevant at all.   >The entire history of European interaction with Africa.  Yeah, let's just make shit up. That has no basis in fact. 
t1_ds4umfd	1	*	Its not a great analogy. In economics, growth itself actually does have benefits that guy is dismissing.
t1_ds4wywu	0	*	Then i don't understand your original point...when dealing with large crowds that are trespassing why are cops wearing riot gear? is that your question?
t1_ds5tmiw	0	*	Yes, and the claim was made that police blew off a woman's arm. Nobody has backed that up with a reputable source.
t1_ds5dwub	0	*	FYI, people from Ferguson consider themselves from St. Louis, as do people living a few towns away.  
t1_ds4zltn	0	*	At what point did simple, common sense arguments start needing a source? Use your fucking brain.
t1_ds5axog	0	*	Because no one's complained about it to me until the comment you're referencing. You can convey sarcasm via text. Obviously normal black people aren't as bad as literal nazi's.
t1_ds4ullc	1	*	Okay then, you have fun with that...
t1_ds4wnor	0	*	This is exactly the line of thinking I'm talking about. Whatever comes from the perceived bad guy is always bogus, irrelevant of what's being said.
t1_ds4wssv	1	*	Seriously. When SOAD sang that lyric, the answer was they send whoever signs up and if the poor sign up, they becone significantly less poor from decent pay and benfits.
t1_ds4yfi4	0	*	I meant during the Revolutionary war. The Constitution wasn't a thing yet, and the office of President did not exist under the Articles of Confederation, nor as part of the Continental Congress.
t1_ds4rrzg	1	*	Right, they specced out for bigger guns and more striking uniforms so there isn't any room left for riot gear. Guess they just have to shoot all the civilians. 
t1_dsuodp9	1	*	Welp. Disagree.   
t1_dsuj1bf	0	*	Feel lucky to live in a country where an elected representative cannot be kicked out because some people don't like him. That wouldn't be a very democratic system. 
t1_dsujvnq	1	*	Because history is meaningless? Especially recent history...  The past does have an affect on the present.
t1_dsule23	0	*	Lol okay dude, I'm the radical. What actual left positions do you support. Because it sounds like you're just another Trump supporter pretending to be a liberal 
t1_dsueg84	1	*	They have the highest standard of living in the world. If that's mediocre then sign me up.
t1_dtrgit1	1	*	What phone are you using? Because most phones right now are using processors developed by Qualcomm, a company with offices and production lines in Israel.
t1_dtrkugp	0	*	Thanks for the answer. Sound pretty dark.
t1_dts7i2t	1	*	We're not talking about history, but about a very specific thing that happened on sunday
t1_dtrkzep	1	*	The vast majority of Jews are not in Europe. The majority of Jews are in Israel, with America having the second most. 
t1_ds3govv	0	*	Good ole whataboutism.

t1_dt60csp	0	*	Those places are a world away, logistics for a fight on the home land is a lot simpler.
t1_dt5y2lz	0	*	I mean no one forces you to build student loans. You can work after high school and go to a trade school for much less and have a very comfortable life.
t1_dt5z7rt	0	*	I agree, can you just explain a little more about conversion rates?
t1_dt649q9	1	*	Political discourse is dead.
t1_dt5zb2o	1	*	Yeah, I think that's why Mueller is good.  He's a boring, registered Republican salary man, essentially.  If he wasn't, we'd probably already know about it.
t1_dt60xt5	0	*	Red base to agent /u/not2serious83: Amerikans do not use fornicate in this context. Refer to Amerikan Idioms chapter 6. Edit post. Out.
t1_dt5y8sb	0	*	And yet it still happened. Surely being the CEO of a country, one would be able to foresee blatantly obvious outcomes?
t1_dt7sygb	0	*	many =/= one lawyer
t1_dt6d8n7	0	*	How about a candidate that the majority voted for in both the primary and the general?
t1_dt61tlq	0	*	Ja, zeg jij maar hoi tegen Putin, klootviool.
t1_dt639nx	0	*	This was his official job.
t1_dt69vaf	0	*	So, we can agree that the media needs to undergo a massive change, right along with everything else in this country?
t1_dt5z8x0	0	*	You know, democracy, hahaha
t1_dt5xkfr	0	*	I dont make claims. I look for evidence :)  Its ok, we will move along and get back to work.
t1_dt5v3t8	1	*	That is a solid point. It would be a whole lot easier to not open it then to to dismiss the results. 
t1_dt98ppp	0	*	> I'm not the one arguing that America is under threat  Attempted thread, perhaps, but you can't argue that Russia didn't attempt to meddle unless you're a troll.
t1_dt60d3z	1	*	It's our grandparents' political scandal you think anyone still gives a shit about it? Give me a fucking break lol.
t1_dt65jyt	0	*	I'm hoping in a civil war situation the military will be on the side of the Constitution rather than the side of the people in power

t1_dsh46th	1	*	He didn't even say that... lol
t1_duq4cr8	0	*	Picks a fight about everyone deserving to die.  Then pivots to a fight about being a superior pot grower.  You're an angry little dude lol.
t1_dslb2wa	1	*	Because he's afraid he might accidentally waver in his faith, duh. It's why creationists avoid reading about genome sequencing or uranium dating.
t1_dsl8oao	0	*	Nah I dont debate with lunatics because they cant lose. 
t1_dsdp561	0	*	No not for printing things said to him. If that's all he did then that would have been totally fine. 
t1_dv2gn1w	0	*	AR-15 is .22 caliber.  Which is the one gun-illiterate people are generally most afraid of and want to ban, so if their goal is to remove that gun, this would not get them to their goal.   
t1_dv1xygu	0	*	In your words what is an auto sear?
t1_dsvrm30	1	*	Yup, and the drone age. It's only going to get scarier when they can pinpoint laser beam your ass from a satellite. 
t1_dtvks87	1	*	see, your insistence on fighting instead of admitting israel's injustice is how this conflict will never end.
t1_dtvtx37	0	*	It's interesting, isn't it?  The Palestinians don't even trust *themselves* to do what's best for them.  
t1_dtychoy	0	*	Blockading a country is metaphorically firing a shot in war
t1_dtstfil	0	*	 what a great reason to burn down a village, right?  
t1_dtsnmbk	0	*	Ouch, just got carpal tunnel clicking downvote on all your shit.
t1_dtbs823	0	*	As much as I hate it, there's a reason the US gets involved in the middle East. It's geopolitics and oil. Both of which matter for US staying a world power. 
t1_ds409bg	0	*	She is the worst president ever! MAGA
t1_dtd1m8c	1	*	Anti semitists isnt a word.
t1_ds8ycw2	1	*	Your point is a straw man, so no, I didn't. I guess coming up with a decent argument is too much to ask of you. 
t1_dt1zhph	1	*	r/conspiracy
t1_dtq9tnz	0	*	What?
t1_dtqaq3y	1	*	Oh that's just rich. If you go through my history and get a hate filled boner sense out of it then you might want to read about projection.
t1_dumshdm	0	*	When your call someone else wrong, and ask for sources, your first step should be your own sources
t1_du72993	1	*	Nah, Roosevelt. Just get them all in one place in the middle of fucking nowhere, so they can think about stuff.
t1_dsbnevr	0	*	A list that doesnt really support that he fulfilled anything...copy-pasta isnt a deflection, more of a read your own content before you post it.
t1_dsawnbw	1	*	Um, wut?  Which part of anything I said is 'right-wing'? I was talking specifically about taxes. Don't politicize what I've said.
t1_dsb4tmo	0	*	and more than likely this is due to the policy of the last adminstration not his
t1_dsb2m1m	0	*	I'll definitely agree with you there, everyone does suck lol
t1_dsbqudc	0	*	Right but that's race. Isn't the definition of ethnicity basically like culture? You can be white but Mexican 
t1_dsbup62	0	*	Then don't do a tax plan. Experiment with UBI. The wage gap is getting bigger and bigger, so something like that needs to be implemented eventually, I think.
t1_dscoi8k	0	*	But nothing you wrote does anything to support why you'd think that.  
t1_dsbairx	0	*	??? The Cold War had no fighting... I'm pretty sure that's why it was named as such..??
t1_dsb8qio	0	*	By not resorting to ad hominems when I lose arguments, should give it a shot.  
t1_dsb3s62	0	*	Actually, it's you who have burden of proof wrong.   Person a makes claim.   Person b disputes.   Person a has the burden of proving his claim.  Hence burden of proof.   
t1_dsbtyyh	1	*	Im not saying it is the same, Im saying thats Trumps logic of how he thinks theyll pay for it when in reality you and I are paying for it. I was explaining it because thats what the OP wanted.

t1_ds5dmnh	1	*	Oh alright.  Well thanks for explaining that.

t1_dtxiq96	1	*	Oh yeah, make no mistake; I don't think this is something that would be practical or legal at all.
t1_dtyfv1t	1	*	Cool man, I guess that's just not the way I see it.
t1_dtxjjfi	1	*	Of course, because the 7 pounds on hour wage is 4-5x of what low wage workers in Poland get.
t1_dtxhlqc	0	*	Seems like a minimum wage job to me?

t1_dswoa6l	0	*	You keep using this phrase protesting a legal right. I do not think it means what you think it means.
t1_dswned0	0	*	U.S. History is filled with the Supreme Court changing their mind.  *Plessy v Ferguson* and *Schenck v United States* are some famous ones.  How would overturning *Roe* be different?  
t1_dsy9ls0	1	*	The states have the same concept. But I don't know of many rights that are guaranteed other than citizenship. 
t1_dswngmy	0	*	What number?

t1_dswpqdd	1	*	so not bullshit?

t1_dsxvitp	1	*	I didn't say it does reduce the crime rate. I said that if it did you still wouldn't be in favor of it. Nice straw man though.
t1_dswlf3f	0	*	Let me mirror this for you Ugh, show me where Canadian law says you have the right to an abortion Hint, its not in morgantaler, where the court EXPLICITLY denied a substantive right
t1_dswsjo2	1	*	Perhaps Russia for oil. Or America for the same thing. The future is a murky place, especially with global warming in the mix. 
t1_dsx9l55	0	*	I live in conservative paradise (Georgia, US) please trade with me

t1_dswrbko	0	*	What is it, then, if not human?
t1_dswtizg	1	*	Gender identity is protected in Canada, therefore (female to) male persons can get pregnant and can have an abortion if that is what they want. 
t1_dsxvxif	0	*	It says in the article, you have to check a box pledging you respect reproductive rights aka abortion and contraception to qualify for the funding.

t1_dv5lsna	0	*	There are I am sure only we need to look beyond our current limits.  
t1_dv4rwsp	0	*	There's limitations to building. You're not maximizing effective building area if you're making room for bike lanes. Some places value that more than they value cyclists
t1_du586j0	0	*	If it's not political then why is marijuana still a schedule 1 drug?
t1_ds6hnap	0	*	It takes time to getting off. Yes, is true. It's called rebound effect. Beta blockers have it too. He should ask a Dr before and after taking any drugs.

t1_dslllv0	0	*	> f***      You wouldn't talk that way around your grandmother would you young man?
t1_dslkpgn	1	*	This is exactly what I'm saying.  Forgive the possession charges and leave everything else...the bad ones will stay in jail because they did more than just have a little pot on them.

t1_ds6f4kn	0	*	> This IS big news. Just because it's news you don't want to hear doesn't mean it isn't big news.  How many big news like this were released last year? 100? 50?
t1_ds6rej3	0	*	It's US politics in regards to foreign leaders and activists who aren't in the US. By definition that's not internal.

t1_ds6gbxq	0	*	I mean for the most part it already is. .   At least the servers that most websites use. You don't have a right to any data that most websites own
t1_ds6ym2v	1	*	I also don't trust anyone who tries to demonize moderate beliefs.
t1_ds6f4r1	1	*	You can be left wing and like capitalism. That doesnt make capitalism left wing, the same way that doesnt make traps right wing. If anything the right wing hates sexual deviance.

t1_dtvyqpp	0	*	Well, if you consider the local economy to be a black hole... The Paris Agreement does not require you to give a single dime to anyone outside your own country.
t1_dtvtao6	1	*	Hey, Trump survived half a dozen bankruptcies. We're doing pretty well compared to him :)
t1_dtwbmiu	1	*	The term the world wont stop spinning usually refers to saying nothing major will change. When in reality if the US withdrew troops from over seas a lot of regions would be changed.
t1_dsb2se9	1	*	I guess you never heard about the Kunduz Trauma Centre?
t1_dsxfynv	0	*	> If that were true there wouldn't be so many of you guys here.  What exactly are you implying here?

t1_dufuggn	1	*	> give a small group of people control over all our resources.  That would be Leninism, which I'm not advocating for.
t1_duncawb	0	*	Owning a fire extinguisher is a preventative measure, but paying attention to your omelette so it doesn't burn just makes more sense and is far more responsible.  EDIT: Fucking autocorrect lol
t1_dtexu00	1	*	Dude you are embarrassing our country. Just stop.   We have merit based migration, why cant the states?  You dont even live there why are you sticking your nose into their migration problems?

t1_dsc06v3	1	*	There's a considerable difference between trading with a military and cultural ally, and trading with a former enemy and current barely neutral trading partner during a time of war.
t1_dsc1vmn	0	*	Taiwanese culture is not Chinese culture.  They arent compatible.  Much more Japanese I believe.
t1_dsczika	1	*	That might be harder nowadays what with russia's shrinking and aging population.
t1_dsbydma	0	*	Are you saying Pearl Harbor was a false flag operation?... Cuz that's why we joined WWII.
t1_dsxgwid	0	*	Hahahaha  When I point out that the us could have given each person in iraq 100,000 dollars in their hand, then of course it is not worth your time. HAHAHAHAHA  100,000 dollars for EACH person
t1_dsc2qfa	1	*	I've never seen someone word grammar corrections this nicely and kindly, so props for that lol.
t1_dsc9m7i	1	*	Well, the hot thing now is coming up with weapons systems that have a range that outstrips radar.  Also stealth detection radar is still in a primitive and unreliable state, so there's that.
t1_dscbxgf	1	*	Russia's economy is 1/15 the size of America's. No amount of Russian trade could offset the loss of the US as a trading partner.
t1_dsbvpcz	1	*	If that happened the usa would levy sanctions on China for sure
t1_dsbuy9o	0	*	Ok, now prove it.
t1_dscnj2o	0	*	And so you think that means China would support Russia? 
t1_dsc2e3h	1	*	I don't see how you can include Syria in any of this.  Afghanistan is still more of a victory than a defeat for the same reasons I just mentioned. 
t1_dsbx71o	1	*	>The USSR did it, of course.  Right.  Russia did it.  That's not debated.  Whether or not Sherman's March counts is what's debated.

t1_dsmz9te	1	*	Einstein was against the quantum interpretation, wasn't he.  That makes him the climate-change denier of his time...imagine the progess human science would have if only he wasn't so stubborn. :)
t1_dv0kppt	0	*	And what makes you think my parents participated in apartheid. You have no idea what you are talking about and the fact that you can't see how you yourself are racist is laughable
t1_dv28vft	0	*	Funny because communism promotes seizure of private property and de facto enslavement of people. Plus it lead to the death of millions in China and Russia.
t1_dv0405s	1	*	The meanings of words change naturally over time through use. At best, you could say that there's a separate definition used by the UN for their own purposes, kinda like the word theory.
t1_dv00kgk	0	*	That doesn't matter. They had jobs, they're proven hard workers. The same cannot be said of other refugee groups.
t1_dv05mg2	0	*	I don't have anything to say, I just think you're a glue sniffing crayon eater. Please don't reproduce and contaminate our gene pool.
t1_dv0vgwd	0	*	Because he kept violating the no fly zone. Also the fact that the initial response was such a clusterfuck caused so many issues. 
t1_dv01m5n	1	*	Well, your argument didnt hold up very well at all did it?
t1_dv00fpl	1	*	Money can be used to buy many peanuts!  ...explain how!  Money can be exchanged for goods and services
t1_dv1iz6u	0	*	The human gait changes as our speed changes, so it's easy to say that they are different words for the speed at which we 'walk'.
t1_dv02wtd	0	*	That is just taking someone's land by force. 
t1_dv00x8u	1	*	He should become the leader of the PC. They apparently have pretty low standards these days for entry.
t1_dv01s18	0	*	Can you show me where that is in the constitution? What if I dont want to give a service to someone whos poor or just uses profanity a lot? Am I not allowed to do that?
t1_dv05jo4	1	*	> Taking BACK land  No? That would imply the ones stealing it now previously owned it.
t1_dv01go9	0	*	Just like American farms gave Native Americans their land back right? 
t1_duzy88k	1	*	Once again, bullshit.  Seriously, what the fuck are you even basing any of this on?  Your feelings?  What you *want* to be true?
t1_dv001yt	0	*	Oh shit what does that mean for the rest of us on earth? 
t1_dv5l0cb	1	*	Ok then the dictionary definition? 
t1_dv088ef	1	*	So you feel safe as a white in South Africa? 
t1_dv00b1a	1	*	Imagine how many human beings got/get/gonna be slaughtered over ideaological bullshit.
t1_duzzx85	0	*	That's all well and good but it's still going to end horribly.
t1_dv02zgo	0	*	Why don't you move to South Africa and start farming, let me know how it goes.
t1_dv3oir0	1	*	They don't talk about it because these are supposedly-privileged white people who are going to get murdered.
t1_duzycyn	0	*	Yeah, actually, because journalists from corporate run media arent incarcerated or murdered for being contemptuous of the government.
t1_dv058w1	0	*	If your father took my father's eye, is it wrong for me to take yours?
t1_dv048pc	0	*	Because by being immigrants rather than descendants, they are self selecting which biases their outcome.
t1_duzzvoa	0	*	Musk 2019
t1_dv034eu	0	*	A simple yes would have sufficed.
t1_dv1q6bc	0	*	That's a good point. Thanks for your insight and explanation!
t1_dv017x6	1	*	Well I think what you need to focus on is the key word at the end of your sentence (which should have a period).... it's a joke... it's not supposed to be fully accurate.
t1_dv0iy18	0	*	This is Africa we are talking about. Seems more likely, that food is going to hunt you and good luck with streams in that climate.
t1_dv0fq2h	1	*	Where do you get your stats? Huge swathes of land is in the hands of tribal leaders and the state. The idea that white people own 70% of the land is not true.
t1_dv0a8g7	1	*	Please, stop wasting your time on us mere reprobates, when you could be telling Africans the true meaning of being black or some other more important use of your time.
t1_dv08234	0	*	What does slavery have to do with anything? Everyone has ancestors that were slaves.
t1_duzz61a	0	*	Well then the rich can just eat the poor. Creates supply and simultaneously lowers demand. 
t1_dv03yuc	1	*	actually Evolve or Devolve I'm not sure 
t1_dv02pne	1	*	Okay. 
t1_dv1bc3m	1	*	if you read the 2 first sentences it seems bad. then the last sentence is better. maybe people reacted too soon.

t1_dt7qqut	0	*	Oh, yeah, that's the same.  https://humanpains.com/2014/08/13/north-korea-concentration-camps-2/
t1_dt86rm6	0	*	Then he wouldn't go ahead with reunification. You're dense. 
t1_dt7azvw	0	*	Even telling your spouse that could elicit a response comparable to an American telling their SO that they're addicted to crack and don't want to stop.
t1_dt7ph0d	0	*	Excuse me, but you're wrong.  The Kowloon Peninsula as well as the Island itself were both ceded to the UK as a permanent arrangement.  Only the New Territories were on a 99-year lease. 
t1_dt7vr0y	0	*	Yes. He had a whole speel about not being able see the curvature of the earth while on a plane.
t1_dt7fxun	0	*	Hi, I wanna read more about these statements. Do you have any other links I could follow through?

t1_dt7f50j	1	*	I'm saying that by definition MAD wouldn't be relevant because...well the destruction wouldn't be mutually assured.
t1_dt7ldz7	1	*	Then maybe your standard for racism changed for worse my dude.
t1_dt7fiqd	1	*	Globalist and proud
t1_dt7pqle	1	*	Like two days ago a post about lynching Obama was upvoted to the top of the sub.
t1_dt7amsh	1	*	He wont be getting that back.
t1_dt79huc	0	*	To be fair, we don't know what they *actually* think
t1_dt8pmxh	1	*	I replied to the wrong person, oops. Was trying to reply to the person who said what about China's cheap labor.  I think your points are correct.
t1_dt8woxy	1	*	>How so? China can't really be touched right now.  Who does China really have for allies?  >Lol, no they don't.  They nearly have a freak out when anyone even mentions Taiwan. 
t1_dt7l9co	0	*	It was a satire sub for a while. 
t1_dt8ttkh	0	*	Even if you defacto stopped the Holocaust and WW2 by doing so? If so, were the killings of Germans by the Allies during WW2 justified?
t1_dt7bwt1	1	*	Well Christopher Hitchens was arrested at a NK resistance meeting so there's probably some talk to some extent.
t1_dt7bk72	1	*	Totally not fixed, man.  e: woot

t1_dt7mp23	1	*	Great comment. Found that really interesting. 
t1_dt7e0dt	0	*	If the borders opened there would be a huge surge into NK, just to be the first mover in terms of business. All sorts of industries would pop up overnight.
t1_dt7e881	0	*	> Today I was able to eat. It was glorious!  Haha, so funny. We tell that same joke.

t1_dt520t3	1	*	And all it cost us was Detroit.
t1_dt799bn	1	*	So? We're talking about trade. Both are fairly similar.
t1_dt61m3z	0	*	Aliens will invade before we live in a world dominated by Canada, you can pretty much count on that.  Happy trails, pardner!
t1_dv031cy	0	*	God you're simple.
t1_du83j36	0	*	OK, so not because they were unsafe.
t1_dscvewt	1	*	But that's exactly what a fascist would say.

t1_dt66fzc	0	*	And use opposing thumbs. Bring on the self driving cars. Soon.
t1_dtlcm28	0	*	I gave you three direct possible explanations that don't involve either magic or the US arming a faction we were bombing the fuck out of.
t1_dtrz9no	1	*	Meteors hit Earth all the time. Its funny youre trying to lecture me on the environment and science when you dont even know the difference between a meteor and comet. Hit the books lad.
t1_dsi7241	1	*	It would be unwise to assume anything about Russia and what it can/can't do. You need to plan for everything even if it's improbable.
t1_dsicim3	1	*	Alright everyone, pack your bags. This guy has cracked the code of Russian capabilities. 
t1_dtkzg8c	0	*	The current Supreme Court entirely aligns by party. Every Republican is a conservative (and supportive of Citizens United). Every Democrat is a liberal (and opposes Citizens United). 
t1_dt2v6i8	1	*	Yeah the unibomber does not belong on that list. He was basically an ecoterrorist (an overused term but accurate in this case).
t1_dtskt07	0	*	Your own source has it at $31,000.
t1_dtrzrjy	1	*	This is also very true, completely different worlds. 
t1_dtsnrfn	0	*	You know that median is NOT the average, correct? Ignoring the fact that you misquoted your own source, you also are blatantly wrongly using it.
t1_dts0cyb	1	*	They're talking about having to bribe someone to do low level routine government stuff. If that happened here in the states those clerks would get fucked so fast.
t1_duyasz7	0	*	That is possibly one of the most stupid, ignorant and fucking retarded things I've ever seen a Redditor type.
t1_dux5qe0	1	*	Excuse my bad English. 
t1_dv0l2q7	1	*	That exact mentally is why my hair is going grey before I've even hit thirty.  I understand working hard but working yourself to death is not the answer.
t1_dv0rxgg	0	*	The crash of 2008 should have been a wakeup call.  I see it failed to reach you 
t1_dv10v41	0	*	Quit passing on the lie.
t1_dv1mgmt	1	*	And this is why I strive to only work for companies where the dev managers are former devs. It's not a fix but at least they tend to understand the technically limitations much better.
t1_dv0k15a	0	*	So we agree that your definition of democracy is flawed.
t1_dv1symm	1	*	I don't blame you. I'm sore as shit when I get home, but when I look at my paycheck knowing I don't owe anyone anything, it's a good feeling.  To me, it's worth it. To others, it might not be.
t1_duq1wfw	0	*	I replied below. 
t1_dtxqiq5	1	*	Again, you ignore my criticism but it is ok. Just try not to be so one-sided in the future, and have fun
t1_dt3ivp3	0	*	Look up Ex Nihilo Mr. Semantics...
t1_dsgo9uo	0	*	Hahahahhahahahhahhahaha  The Simpsons already did it...... Also if you voted Trump than you aren't that liberal. I'm fairly conservative for a liberal and even I smelled his bullshit right away. 
t1_dso080o	0	*	People like you make it impossible for us to protect our rights. I wish autism disqualified you from voting.
t1_duxyxaf	0	*	Lol so got it, 'if' statements count for Nobel prize level products.   Come on. Dont be a gore apologist...let's use this to actually make real change.   
t1_dt3jnrx	0	*	Anti-trust case against China? Good luck with that. They have manipulated their currency forever and nobody does shit. Like anyone is going after them for solar panels.
t1_dtirgws	1	*	Carry on then
t1_dsqfsrr	1	*	Don't be so certain. People swore up and down the US economy was robust in 1929 and 2008 and all those recessions in between. I never said it would go bankrupt in the traditional sense. 
t1_ds2dxbi	1	*	yep
t1_ds1917h	1	*	And, hopefully, a sensible population
t1_ds1asic	1	*	That'd be just one nuke. I doubt in the event of an all out nuclear war any of the involved parties would just launch a single nuke lol

t1_dv3dfvv	1	*	That one says November 2015, so definitely not the one I'm talking about. That was back in 2011 or 2012. 
t1_dud9j50	1	*	I am not talking about the plans politicians had or have. What I am refering to is the feeling of the German people. And our people do not wish nukes to be deployed from our country or our soil.

t1_dud1zur	0	*	Only when you earn over like xa321k (which is nothing), all the while never really paying it down because the interest is 10% of income. 
t1_dtcbam1	0	*	Yes... and times change. You're choice to believe it or not.
t1_dsr2ind	0	*	Why do you think Mexico is in that situation? American guns and money flowing into Mexico for drugs. The war on drugs and the CIA funded disruption of various South/Central American democracies.
t1_dsryvkp	1	*	In Portugal, you have to actually have your Id with you, Drivers license is not enough.
t1_dsqx1kj	1	*	Yeah, there are definitely a few small pockets in the US, New Orleans is definitely one of them, but comparatively as a whole, the US is *nothing* close to Europe in terms of diversity. 
t1_dsrlxsz	0	*	Well, ok. Maybe people of different cultures and different upbringings are, you know, different. I am sorry Black people scare you. I hope you don't let that fear turn to hate.  
t1_dsr07vn	0	*	You're welcome. A number of the things on the actual site (like the fake Melania quote and the made-up names for the confederate battle flag) have become in-jokes for me. 
t1_dsqzppk	0	*	It's actually cheaper than that if you book more than a couple of days in advance. Weekend after next you can get a return flight for 54 euro per person.

t1_dv3276p	0	*	I'm not the person who made that comment. I'm replying to what *you* said in *your* comment.
t1_dv3h3fx	0	*	Umm youre the one who literally asked me to read a Dow Jones graph in a previous comment. Its pretty clear you dont know what youre talking about here 
t1_dv2roq3	1	*	I rode a bus in university for sports from Hamilton to Thunder Bay and I'm pretty sure it took a decade off my life
t1_dv2q78x	1	*	Sub'd.
t1_dv4j9no	0	*	I am not talking about being biased; I am talking about diluting the worth of the vote based on where you live. Which isnt in that definition, is it?
t1_dv2u76j	1	*	Holy shit this argument is the most stereotypical childish interwebs argument I've ever seen
t1_dv2p8px	1	*	That would be the populist wave that hit.  Bernie would have been able to dip into that as well, whereas clinton, being very much an establishment politician, was not able to.
t1_dv2scad	1	*	in saskatchewan you can watch your dog run away for 3 days.
t1_dv2rmxx	1	*	Home run!
t1_dv2r7zm	0	*	Yeah idk what this guy is talking about
t1_dv2qr88	0	*	Im glad you have found an outlet to tell everyone your 'fee-fees'. Try backing up your emotions with some facts.
t1_dv2u7b5	1	*	Seems way too difficult to find such information or understand it, everyone should probably just make up their own minds and then stick rigidly to their made up position.
t1_dv2uzpw	0	*	Media literate, not intelligent.   And media literacy is an apolitical issue. People (myself included some times) are just generally terrible at it.
t1_dv2rzbt	1	*	Yeah we were just trying to do this thing where our points were totally uncontested and you said nothing in reply.
t1_dv2qtrv	0	*	Is that why you guys keep raving about your maple syrup?
t1_dudrmll	0	*	I just went all the way down that wormhole. Complex shit 
t1_dudt7en	1	*	240,000 aztects killed by Spanish Empire. Sorry that was a bit snarky and retarded wording on my part.
t1_dudredd	0	*	Oh, that is true. West Africa was just entering the age of conquest and empires around give or take a few centuries when they came in contact with Europe.
t1_dt79xts	1	*	It's funny because SK was also a dictature back then... just a dictature backed by the Anti-comi movement in the US... it's not until late 70 it became a democracy... really fighting for freedom...
t1_dtuklo2	0	*	Then that's a problem with your American legal system then isn't it?
t1_dtufw84	1	*	Okay, I should more accurately say that it makes *me and my friends* less productive. I can't speak for everybody of course.
t1_dturbmp	0	*	I have been speaking English my entire life and I have never once seen someone make that distinction. Literally not once. 
t1_dtwikgf	1	*	I'm tagging you as context guy lol
t1_dsj6fac	1	*	it's just that the us isn't responsable for it.
t1_dtjugz3	0	*	Many of the most militant settlers occupying the West Bank who wander around  abusing Palestinians with a gun in their belt arent even israeli.  Theyre American or European. Do they count?
t1_duxw3vb	0	*	Well, that and a belief in a magical man in the sky that will save your soul and make you live forever, so you dont really need to worry too much about what happens on earth.

t1_duw08pp	1	*	*.. but it was a fun ride!!*
t1_duy7dvn	0	*	something other than the causation-correlation tactic I see used now.  Why are you convinced that this is somehow different than all of the previous climate change periods that have happened prior?
t1_duw7bpc	1	*	Once again, Baby Boomers cashing in their magic place in time and space. 
t1_duw40p6	1	*	nope, not just concerned with GHGs
t1_duwnip6	1	*	Yeah, you're right. It's sad that a lot of the mentality in the US is so anti all of this :(
t1_duwcelu	0	*	Are you going to answer my question so we can have a discussion or will you just continue to hurl insults?
t1_du72i5g	0	*	We talked a lot. I brought in articles arguing my point and he'd do the same. in the end, you have to accept that you can't reason someone out of a position they didn't reason themselves into
t1_dsfyemv	0	*	Well if we're talking about dissapearing sources that it would be around even (not that you've established that they get any money for these)   Middle east is a big place and not all of it is at war
t1_duv59sx	1	*	Thank you, being realistic isn't being minimalistic. The starving due to droughts and storms will be the worst problem, not the disappearing of land.
t1_duu9814	1	*	Yeah but he said population reduction meaning a somewhat permanent drop. Most of those people will have kids n such replacing if not increasing the population. 
t1_duw2hmi	1	*	None of us had waders, but I didn't see any trash in the river 
t1_ds1ukqe	1	*	No thats your flair
t1_dtoiejl	0	*	Yeah I don't dispute that. But it was still split about 50/50 between the populations.
t1_dtl3v66	1	*	Just be sure to hold up a fig leaf and run the 'oil painting' filter over it so you can call it art.
t1_duu71i0	0	*	Yeah, fascism is totally the answer to democracy with gerrymandering, voter supression and corruption, not simply removing those three things.
t1_dt2opx8	1	*	Exactly. That's the best descriptor of God I've heard.   A placeholder that describes or defines* that which thus far is beyond definition.  Edited.

t1_dtgci5b	0	*	In that case than neither do yours. I specifically explained my point. How is that not an argument?
t1_dt2oucr	1	*	He'd make a cringe video calling out his haters and be relentlessly mocked.

t1_dtezgln	0	*	In your opinion.
t1_dsf9mp3	0	*	Ultimately if no NN law is passed by congress and all the lawsuits fail it will lead to me paying higher prices for inferior service and it will limit the types of websites I can view. 
t1_dtobqpi	0	*	Most people skeptical of climate change are skeptical because there isn't enough data to suggest otherwise. Not having enough proof is absolutely a reasonable doubt.
t1_dv4okis	0	*	> A stun grenade is a grenade.  So is a tear gas grenade. So is this toy plastic grenade I can buy on amazon. Adding more detail isn't harmful as you seem to imply it is.
t1_dv51ln2	1	*	They were used by police since their invention, also you can't just decide that flashbangs are a weapon of war because you think so, that's not how it works.
t1_dsy2ylj	1	*	Obviously you've never been to Fort McMurray.
t1_dufqmb7	0	*	You're not okay.
t1_dugb92n	1	*	Upvote for that
t1_dug8h3h	0	*	Bricks kill people as well, doesn't mean we should ban construction work. Guns are manufactured for the explicit purpose of killing people, you numpty.  
t1_duglkfk	0	*	This may be what you heard, from the full transcript: 2393 Kudrinsky: We'll get out of this. Everything's fine ... Gently [unintelligible], gently ... Pull up gently!

t1_dsx6v90	1	*	Ideas are more dangerous than standing armies.
t1_dsn4p9e	0	*	You laugh now, but it's a distinct possibility, unless the Republican party comes to its senses before October. If they do, then we get President Ryan. The choice is yours.
t1_dsq8rwl	0	*	Yes which means Obama should have been the one killing it but he failed to do so.  That is what non-leaders do.
t1_dso1i8p	1	*	Someone failed to read prior comments to gain a proper understanding as to whats being discussed

t1_dsosk4t	0	*	Ok, I didn't say any of this was particularly good for the average person. We're talking about the impact on **business climate**
t1_dtyefgx	0	*	Per 100,000 people US has 700 in jail, Europe 100. Well done. US wins again.   What would you prefer? To be burgled, raped,  and assaulted, or murdered?

t1_dsaof8t	1	*	Israel is neither an ethnostate nor a theocracy.  And no, generally arguing against the existence of states wouldn't get you into trouble. If you single out Israel's right to exist the problems start.

t1_dtucajh	0	*	What's unsafe in what I'm doing? I'm only dialing when the car is fully stopped.  Seriously, what did I say that was unsafe? According to studies holding a phone when driving is perfectly safe.
t1_ds95o2l	0	*	The explanation wont work, they are the same type of person who is offended gays exist even when they are just holding hands, because it infringes my religious beliefs to see one other than my own.

t1_duov9o6	1	*	Here's the thing, all you had to do was explain *how* they're different, but clearly you're unable to.
t1_duo1frb	1	*	He is saying that shooting someone because you feel threatened by them is okay, if that's not a slippery slope I don't know which is. Especially on the street, this is not the wild west.
t1_duqfr30	1	*	What data do you have to support the idea that random people with guns would improve an active shooter situation?
t1_duofs7b	1	*	My wife is Brazilian. Trust me, America and Brazil are very different. 
t1_duodjh1	1	*	Yes, American gun owners just don't compare to illiterate Afghani farmers. Jesus Christ

t1_duoicry	0	*	Not if it's a private sale
t1_dupvwak	0	*	If someone is intent on killing someone else, how would a semi-automatic weapons ban stop them? They've already committed to breaking the law.   Law abiding citizens aren't the ones killing people.
t1_dtik4ja	0	*	Jesus. Is that for all the staff or for trumps tummy?
t1_dtiuslw	0	*	No, you just want to refuse their right to a lawyer, their right to call witnesses, and their right to a jury trial. 
t1_dtieccq	1	*	Nah. More than 10 engineers for sure. Building material cost, time, electricity, etc
t1_dtj0nz8	0	*	Glad someone posted it! This was always my favorite. 
t1_dtikwl4	0	*	Sure, if your landlord has tried to evict you but you stay there for no other reason than you are vastly stronger than him, and he isn't cashing your cheques, that'll be the same thing.
t1_dtijw2m	0	*	No, he definitely hasn't if he associates it with golf.
t1_dtifn26	0	*	Because the US decided it is the world's police 
t1_dtijlok	0	*	Taxpayers pay for his golf trips, and since he's visiting golf sites he owns, that money goes to him.
t1_dtinn54	1	*	I hear they showed reruns of The Nanny in solitary confinement, with the sound cranked.    I'd have been bashing my head against a wall trying to kill myself if that happened.

t1_dtifowa	0	*	>what about it?
t1_dtigrba	0	*	The war doesn't have to be declared by any of the warring sides. The nature of the conflict and applicability of the Conventions are established by International Red Cross on behalf of the UN.
t1_dtikb9c	0	*	Declaring a war in Congress does not preclude the president from conducting war in practice.  ...as we saw in Vietnam, and many other wars where prisoners of war were taken.
t1_dtimvhj	1	*	Yeesh I thought we were joking around but that's some serious torture. Imagine them being forced clockwork orange style to watch The Room or something with the audio behind.

t1_dssx9jg	0	*	Why not let them kill themselves?
t1_dv4kcm3	1	*	There are very many 'white' looking 'brown' Indians, anyway my comment was supposed to highlight the stupidity of the terms we use to describe people. Which you also seem to have highlighted.

t1_ds2zet9	1	*	https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/11-Nor-9-carboxy-THC  My comment below goes into a tad more detail
t1_ds2nejw	1	*	? The comment was not deleted.  Do you think those prices are Expensive? Because they are not. End of the discussion I guess
t1_ds1v31o	0	*	That just patently false.  Give me a single media org that Trump has closed thru any action personally? 
t1_dsgkrec	0	*	Not real offers and they refused Arab deals, they're also wiping Palestine off the map and if they were going to genocide Jews they had centuries of opportunity but they never did, unlike Europeans. 
t1_du7s5mb	0	*	That's the problem though, you don't think. 
t1_ds8wxwj	0	*	Must be so difficult. Can't even imagine. Good luck. 
t1_ds8zrkd	1	*	Thanks. If you asked Bandit, he can be a butthole but is still a good cuddle buddy. To me, he is a boop-aholic that purrs like a McLaren. 
t1_ds984a8	0	*	I like stuff that's easy to drink.  And Buffalo Trace is a nice place to visit, the people there are outstanding.
t1_ds8kmhh	1	*	The word is essentially useless.  It's little more than a marketing buzzword at this point.
t1_ds8pqso	0	*	Thanks for the sources. I'll see if I can find where I learned about the arthritis 
t1_ds8j22k	0	*	That's fucked up if it's true, I can't imagine the most serious (I.E. global) breeders would do it though, since that stuff doesn't fly well in Europe.

t1_dtejjlb	0	*	I rest my case.
t1_durxqeq	1	*	It's still a shit sentence
t1_ducnzih	1	*	Maybe not, but he/she was responding to a comment challenging the existence of evidence for their position. So it was an appropriate response.
t1_dusto49	1	*	No, you lost handily.  
t1_dt09znu	1	*	No, they burn in Hell according to many Christian sects
t1_dt1vxmy	1	*	> Jar Jar wasn't manipulated into serving his enemy   this is literally the opposite of the case. have you seen Star Wars? 
t1_dszo1aa	0	*	Maybe because it was a giant fucking waste of money? And maybe because we footed the majority of the bill, with nothing in return? 
t1_dt03ksg	1	*	Of course she did. She would have been on birth control had she been married. 
t1_dt5f8ic	1	*	Ok. You played it too serious with this kind of topic for me to consider sarcasm.
t1_dt1m2w6	1	*	This.
t1_dtje7ow	1	*	It's usually the related men (and sometimes women) who pose a risk.
t1_dtiy3ym	0	*	Maybe it's the line of work I'm in (convenience store assistant manager) but there are just as many hooligans than there are nice and decent people.
t1_dtixaw7	1	*	or seattle, or portland. 
t1_dtjk5nu	0	*	Men are not just as vulnerable as women.  Everyone is vulnerable but women are smaller and not as strong, so they are *more* vulnerable.  I never said that men are not vulnerable.   
t1_dtinqm9	1	*	Did you just assume their gender? That's sexist!
t1_dtj64i4	0	*	I think we're both on the same path but at different stages. If you Google Maslow hierarchy of needs, I'm on the bottom and you're a few levels up.

t1_dtnydmp	1	*	It literally wasn't
t1_dto4n5w	1	*	I never called for civility. That's the other rational person you were lobbing childish insults at while trying to sell how smart you are. This is going really well for you, chief. 
t1_dtnzhtb	0	*	? So you don't believe the AP story or what 
t1_dur016u	1	*	lol I don't know why you hate Muslims but I shouldn't argue with teenagers on the net
t1_du6pyqs	1	*	I should point out that this book was written in 1969, which was pre-Reagan and pretty much the height of social mobility for America.
t1_du6ydj2	1	*	They would ban one of the most prominent and respected American socialist authors for promoting fucking self esteem. 
t1_du7bn4c	1	*	> Most Americans don't really care if they ever become millionaires. They just want to live a good life and make their own way... or they used to anyway.  Oh if they only knew there was a better way.
t1_du6mhjc	0	*	Which, interestingly enough, is about impossible to do.
t1_du7oe8v	1	*	They point out in the sidebar that they will ban any comments that are pro capitalism or anti socialism.   The sub is just filled with immature kids who dont want to be challenged on their views

t1_duovkqs	1	*	What's so unbelievable about it? Seems as true now as it did in 1969
t1_du74918	1	*	The claim that one side must lose completely is equally as  naive. All sides have to lose here, and be ok with that as the cost of lessening hostilities.
t1_du72m0f	0	*	Uh huh, billions of dollars in aid to Israel, so that we can park our military there to bomb other brown people in the Middle East.   Wonderful trade guys. 
t1_du75qbm	1	*	It's the least of things.
t1_du8aoyu	1	*	I did. No I don't believe Hamas is composed entirely of freedom fighters. I said there are terrorists on both sides
t1_du7fe77	1	*	>... or they used to anyway.   BACK IN MY DAY WE USED TO WANT TO LIVE GOOD LIVES AND WE'D MAKE OUR OWN WAY UPHILL BOTH WAYS TO SCHOOL FOR TWENTY MILES-
t1_ds28a7l	1	*	Thats the worst actually. Self censoring happens when censorship becomes the norm. It is incredibly damaging.
t1_ds1txdm	1	*	It would never end. It never ends at just one person or one thing. 
t1_ds2h6ke	1	*	i agree fully with your assessment that there are many humans who are morons
t1_dueggok	1	*	>Please explain how pointing out this is 'condescending'. Or is hearning anything you don't want to hear condescending?  Gotta love how the only response they had to this  is war is bad. 
t1_duehmc6	1	*	Got it. Capitalism is perfect and its more important to you than yourself. Makes complete sense.

t1_ds1hnls	1	*	That wasn't an invasion
t1_ds1ojze	1	*	I wasnt saying anything with certainty. I was just playing Devils advocate there and being optimistic. I also agreed with you in my last two sentences there.

t1_ds1gcjo	1	*	Why would they restrict themselves to just themselves. You think madmen that would need to be in charge will like the US and whites?
t1_ds1hia3	0	*	You have zero empathy -- and by that I don't mean 'Oh, you should feel sorry for these people', but rather 'you seem incapable of analyzing situations from the logical eyes of others'.

t1_ds1u6ip	1	*	You're so fucking naive lmao
t1_ds1gjol	1	*	Oh. Yeah the I'm going to spend a trillion dollars on infrastructure thing was all a show.   Hell, Obama did just that, and the Republicans criticized him up and down for it.
t1_ds1hnht	1	*	You could be right, but in my view they are playing the same game that Trump is. Talk a big game and seem unstable to win concessions. In actuality, family and land mean everything in these cultures. 
t1_dtqgf2u	0	*	Worked out fine for natives also? Think what youre saying.  Because we are the natives in Europe. 
t1_dtr0p95	0	*	> That is a false presumption.  No it's not   >  There is no inherent social contract that suggests this unless the citizens wish it to be so.  Yes there is 
t1_du2kxyo	1	*	I haven't denied anything. If you read between the lines, what I have stated is your argument is bullshit and hyperbole. I wouldn't expect you to understand the difference, though.
t1_du1cufh	1	*	I just answered what might happen if the US stopped being a superpower, and was somehow magically defeated.
t1_dtpvrhz	0	*	Hm. How do they track my location, then? Seems strange. 
t1_dsoefxi	1	*	Yall-Qaeda
t1_dsq9dqb	1	*	Thats more a problem with the media hyping up stories without proper investigation. They just go for clicks which is a big problem, by the time the facts come out its too late...
t1_dsqfbxc	0	*	Question is did she go to the police or her parents?
t1_dsn52wn	1	*	Entirely possible- I wouldn't know either way if he had edited his post.

t1_du2xav7	0	*	OK Alanis.
t1_du3ff4n	0	*	> Yes it is. Don't get in an accident. There are many things you can to do prevent this.  HOLICHIT! You're right!   What if airline pilots don't know about this?! Somebody needs to tell them STAT! 
t1_du30as1	0	*	He left Russia when he was 10: he doesn't know jack shit about what goes on in Russian streets now.
t1_du3637x	0	*	You could have potentially prevented the accident by avoiding putting yourself in a position where there is nothing you could do to prevent an accident. If you cant swim, avoid going near the water. 
t1_du370q3	0	*	I think we are ignoring the username here. 
t1_du38myg	0	*	Yes, an improperly secured armored vehicle smashed into the rear cargo door, also destroying the hydraulic controls of the plane.

t1_du32jag	0	*	No, not really
t1_du420k5	1	*	Semantics still doesn't ignore the fact it's a stealth tax... Let's say you and to watch sky sports only, no BBC. Without streaming from sky Go onto your TV, you need a TV license
t1_du30ujo	1	*	If you simply think a bit about the people who were onboard - it would do.
t1_du4fwse	1	*	Yeah thats why i think the Israeli plane downing was done on Russian orders.
t1_du36pj1	1	*	I'm not OP.... :| again with the reading comprehension? maybe just try to read a little more carefully
t1_du3fxas	1	*	That one jumped out at me too.   All I could think was fuuuuuuuuuck.
t1_du2wzou	0	*	That is definitely not how that works. In fact, I believe the term for that is the [gambler's fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_fallacy).
t1_du37dzn	1	*	Yeah that's what I'm saying, but in the center lane there's nowhere to go so you can only really prevent your car from being pushed into the car ahead.  
t1_du37iju	1	*	This is exactly what Russia wants!
t1_du39skz	0	*	Ever seen those videos where the ATC guy trolls kids on Flight SIM online? Something about how seriously he takes it and holds character the whole time is friggin hilarious.
t1_dtac9lh	0	*	It does. It's just does.
t1_dt5s20f	0	*	That last sentence is an absolute lie
t1_dt4zl2x	0	*	So then why are you conflating the average African with the kind of Africans that are apparently immigrating to the US?
t1_dsvqg2m	0	*	I have an average middle-class income. But it's weird because I was told only the richest people will be receiving tax cuts.
t1_dsxfmi8	1	*	Well if you want to fuck  Puerto, its actually not my problem. It wont be a problem for the country I live in today and my home country too.
t1_dt5kehi	0	*	I don't know what history books you were reading, but until not that long ago, everyone was invading and murdering everyone else. 
t1_dsdr43t	1	*	So if you dont want to educate people, you comment why ? To make yourself feel good ?

t1_duljlh4	1	*	You are the most obvious Whataboutyourwhataboutism troll I've ever seen. 
t1_duldvp6	1	*	All totalitarianism is not fascism. Fascism is its own specific flavour of totalitarianism. Please don't diminish the meaning of the words by conflating them.
t1_dukydwu	0	*	Fascism isn't a synonym for totalitarianism. 
t1_dsn5rj8	1	*	It was definitely a slow but steady decline...

t1_dtb6nkg	0	*	Lol ok mate 
t1_dtaqte2	1	*	I mean, considering idiots are the only people who seriously use it...
t1_dta0hd7	0	*	I had a labor job and proved myself to be trainableand like you said, have a love for learning.  I took bio, Chem and algebra in college so it's not like I was clueless.
t1_dtaoe54	1	*	Hi boss, I can do maths, give me a raise!   You must have been a GREAT emergency care worker lol. I would have hated to be the victims needing help and then coming across your happy attitude....
t1_dta0dki	1	*	There was the other WikiLeaks report leaked that had a death toll of enemy combatants that as far as I remember seemed pretty telling that the numbers were skewed.
t1_dtay51z	0	*	Communism is okay? Would you rather live in your country, or a Warsaw pact country? 
t1_dtag9gg	1	*	Laugh out loud!! I found this humorous as well.
t1_dtafpx1	0	*	ipse dixit, right?
t1_dtabp2i	0	*	1. Your experiences aren't universal   2. If ppl keep calling you a Nazi only because you lean right maybe you need to actually look a little deeper at your own comments/actions

t1_dtas3m4	1	*	Ah, I see. Thanks.
t1_dtaur1p	0	*	Only after you invade Poland first.
t1_dtbg65t	1	*	Dude... All I ever said is that are actually still people out there that share 1930 Nazi ideology; and that we shouldn't throw the term Nazi at people who are really just assholes. 
t1_dtacfdq	0	*	By being funny?  Edit: Did you read the article? There is an example of a comedian calling a politician a Nazi bitch on public TV and the case being dismissed because it was obviously satire.
t1_dt9yagp	1	*	An okay plan implemented today will always be better than a perfect plan implemented tomorrow.
t1_dta8i3c	1	*	Have you ever heard German jokes? 
t1_dtarx2f	1	*	There are two types of freedom . The freedom from something and the freedom to do something. Having both is mostly impossible
t1_dtajspd	0	*	We are winning, yes.
t1_dtaa417	0	*	Yea, totally does.  11 does seem high, for Germany, but there might some some trend I'm not aware of. 
t1_dtakbv5	1	*	oh no, I mean speaking as an experienced bisexual. 
t1_dt9q2rv	0	*	We have our flaws but we aren't anywhere near as toxic as America.
t1_dt9xdqv	1	*	I found the hard part was not being so bored you fall asleep....so i dropped out and never went back lol
t1_dta9bep	0	*	I agree, but no one was talking about them. Someone literally asked where white supremacists are and they gave an example and even said it's not a lot of them. 
t1_dszr4hi	1	*	Probably not even rich.  Just delusional.  The fact he just assumed Japanese girls would just throw themselves at him is just comical.
t1_dt1nsj4	0	*	Company money? Eat as much as Otsumami (without shari) and drink whatever Daiginjo they have!
t1_dsztzbt	0	*	Naw dude I meant the sex-ed class not just the video
t1_dshc68m	0	*	Okay... So Iraeli encroachment into Palestinian territory is okay?
t1_dsbqfoz	1	*	You will surprised how many Americans are in China.. the US depends on immigrates, you guys can't even survive without them, not the other way around.. 
t1_dv5qty3	0	*	That one is too easy. 
t1_ds84129	0	*	Okay, I'll answer your question. No, none of the things you mentioned are strong arm tactics to censor and silence people, in my opinion. Now answer mine.
t1_ds1rfds	1	*	Gosh this is the dumbest comment in the thread. 
t1_ds2a0a8	1	*	They were armed with rocks as far as I can tell. Just because guns are more engineered doesn't make the age old rock any less deadly.
t1_ds1ts7j	0	*	It says used in hostilities which is what she was doing.
t1_duag5rm	0	*	Just because you deride something as ugh, *lame* doesnt make it valid. All it does is reveal your infinite childishness. 
t1_duai4nl	0	*	Now you're ignoring my main points and failing to present any points of your own. I guess I'm done here.
t1_duqsf5j	0	*	>*cringe*
t1_duq9ufm	1	*	Functionally and factually. 
t1_duqbzkp	1	*	Lol cmon man. What a dumb question. That's clearly not what OP implied.  The Russians have a huge nuclear arsenal. DPRK simply doesn't have anywhere near that number of nukes.
t1_duqf118	1	*	oh i doubt that very much.
t1_duq92bu	1	*	And a militia is comprised of? 
t1_duqdikf	1	*	That's because they come so fast that we're still reeling from the previous one. Somehow it's paralyzing and then nothing gets done about any of it.
t1_durvdv4	0	*	You're being intentionally stupid. Please argue in good faith or admit you're wrong and leave.
t1_duq74zg	1	*	Gladly. have a good night U0001f44cU0001f44cU0001f44cU0001f44cU0001f44c
t1_duqfbc8	1	*	Fair enough.
t1_duqco4f	0	*	There must be a valid investigation! Independent is totally the best news out there.  How's the Mueller investigation going?   inb4 muh indictments, too bad none of them involve Trump.
t1_duqnxx3	0	*	That's what they say, sure. Scalia had a way of being able to make it seem like he was being a strict constitutionalist even when he was engaging in judicial activism.
t1_duqcfa2	1	*	You say this like the mainstream media isn't fear-mongering *right now* about how scary guns are.
t1_duqhclz	1	*	This is the same with Australia, yet our petrol prices are still higher. 
t1_duqggvy	0	*	[Kinda seems relevant, but if not, still worth posting...](http://myfunnymemes.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Kevin-Hart-Takes-Big-Words-As-Disrespect-In-40-Year-Old-Virgin.jpg)
t1_duqfeuz	1	*	for he or she*
t1_duqlvoe	1	*	Trump's words are borderline irrelevant too. We don't even take him seriously anymore.
t1_duqej9c	1	*	They knew guns were going to get better, but I really dont think they had any reasonable way to predict that people would be shooting up schools with them.
t1_duqbtog	0	*	They have to reveal where their money comes in their tax filings and can only raise money as a non-profit in specific ways. 
t1_duqixc8	1	*	Congress can refer to the Senate & the House together.
t1_durdknv	1	*	You got a source or anything? That's quite a big claim 
t1_durdozb	0	*	Great genetic fallacy.   Again, socialist only in name. Not socialist in action whatsoever.   Keep making things up though. It's funny how liberals will do anything to make themselves look right.
t1_dutsalo	1	*	k
t1_durahav	0	*	Uh huh.  I can got to r/LateStageCapitalism for examples of you want.  It's also Marxist failed garbage.
t1_dururi8	1	*	Was drinking, my bad. Oh drunk redditing...
t1_durdbra	0	*	I bet you think trickle-down economics is good too. What a muppet. 
t1_dur7ylj	0	*	Of course overthrowing foreing governments is bad, of course.  But maybe, MAYBE if he did put a capitalist dude on power, people on Venezuela would be better today 
t1_dut9pmd	1	*	if you seriously think south america isn't capitalist then i dont know what to tell you
t1_dur6wvw	1	*	This kills people.
t1_dur5aa1	0	*	I wish I got to pick which capitalist states counted as real capitalists after I got to see which ones ended up working out. It seems like such a charmed life haha
t1_dur7p12	1	*	Dude is the new Jesus for milenias
t1_dskfuz4	1	*	 it was only a ~~joke~~ metaphor ah ha ha nah they just didn't know what they were talking about
t1_dsiwmmn	1	*	Banning people like this is okay because its memes  What about the first pic? Or the third? Are you selectively blind? 
t1_ds3n4uo	1	*	Maybe. But sometimes you want people to know what you're saying is negative. Nobody joins a board just to appease other board members.
t1_dsp0m54	1	*	Except Mark and Priscilla announced it like they are giving up all their capital, and they are not. 
t1_dsoyyoy	0	*	How are you supposed to sue anonymous sources?

t1_dudwjtj	1	*	Well, the UK is leaving the EU so that'll be a moot point soon enough.
t1_dskoujb	0	*	That wasn't the point. What I'm saying is, trump is so bad that people would rather have Bush. Who clearly was a shit president. It baffles me that a few of you are getting lost in the comparison. 
t1_dskv4dp	0	*	How about the hundreds of thousands of people in the US, that die each year, because they don't go to the emergency room and get the care they need because they can't afford it?
t1_dskv5zz	1	*	They did a pretty damn good job in 2016. Things came out within margin of error. I'd call that a success. 
t1_dskry2j	1	*	Primarily shotguns. Not great for sniping. I'd be surprised if there are over a million.
t1_dskzvs3	0	*	Look at our navy, army, Air Force, and the marine corps.  You really think America is weak?  All our strategic bases around the world yet, we are weak.  Ok,  sure, we are weak lol

t1_dsymwse	1	*	That is some koan material right there.
t1_dscvyo3	1	*	You'd be hard-pressed to find any computer PCB that doesn't have a foxconn component. Your motherboard has at least 1.
t1_dsea1yp	1	*	And you going straight at me ignoring the part I've said about those workers saving hundreds of dollars really shows how you care, yeah goodbye, really wish I'm actually paid to speak to you.

t1_dscubat	1	*	Good on you man

t1_dur1rkn	1	*	Apparently if you dont go private the USA is cheaper.
t1_dtaakd4	0	*	..... You said herbivores. Not all herbivores are ruminants - cows are a type of ruminant....I only didn't use the term ruminant (actually removed it) because you obviously aren't versed in biology. 
t1_duymxa3	1	*	I do.
t1_dv30rvl	1	*	Trust me, I am.

t1_duyor08	0	*	I think Hillary sucks ass which is separate from Trump being a threat.  
t1_duz1i1g	0	*	Thats how witch hunts work.  You need evidence to prove probable cause of a crime being committed, otherwise you are simply targetting someone.

t1_dv4w642	1	*	You mean that thing that people who were there admitted was caused because he was in a bad mood?
t1_du0pjhy	0	*	And if you fail?

t1_dtfzp55	0	*	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWxsXma06eg
t1_du0rr20	1	*	Again, you provide me no incentive to do anything for you.
t1_duvc8nf	1	*	Yep same old playbook Uncle Sam has been using for decades now, and a new generation keeps falling for it every time.
t1_dtcqku5	1	*	The points are that A: you misidentified Afghanistan as having a Russian border. B: you used the wrong spelling of border/boarder. 
t1_dugz3f5	0	*	Dude just accept you did a stupid thing and move on.
t1_dugzfvq	0	*	Genocide isn't supposed to threaten the existence of anything. You literally quoted the definition to me, you should know that better than I do. Come on, man.
t1_dugyu7z	0	*	So just to be clear, having a joint US-Germany Olympic Team would not be a form of cooperation?
t1_duju30t	1	*	The vast majority of people don't understand geopolitics and international interests/relations. Don't bother wasting your time on someone so willfully ignorant of even basic facts of WWII.
t1_dsp1qft	0	*	You speak as if China lacked the ability to launch satellites.
t1_dsp0q11	0	*	TBH, what I've read on McArthur makes me think he's a giant douche.
t1_dspb931	0	*	Because maybe you want to actually *use* facilities you plunder instead of having to rebuild?
t1_dsprhmf	0	*	Doesn't the image you posted show the range of the fallout and the estimated resulting casualties...?
t1_dsou1n3	1	*	In war civilian casualties wins faster than infrastructure.
t1_dsp6uzd	1	*	Bully with a gun.
t1_dspfqj3	1	*	One was an attempt at a clever acronym, the other was just How can I say this quickly.  Or at least that's what it looks like at first glance.
t1_dsp6n33	0	*	and rediscovered or replaced most of it.
t1_dsq3dtm	0	*	I don't remember learning that water or nitrogen are flammable, so I'm calling bullshit.
t1_dsp8qdk	0	*	There used to be MAD magazine too. People like MAD
t1_dspew1f	0	*	Great argument that isn't flawed at all...
t1_dss0br9	1	*	Sufferers of Trump Derangment Syndrome can't logic.
t1_dsrzahs	0	*	Fine people wielding torches and chanting Jews will not replace us!? Ok, I'm done with this conversation.
t1_dssrhxs	0	*	Threatening force is all nuclear weapons are good for. Study up on the cold war.  If Kim is going to use nuclear weapons on anyone, it's not because of a Twitter feed.
t1_dsrs4dc	1	*	To me the Popular feed is the front page, it changes from day to day based on the meme economy and how I feel about it.
t1_dss2rfz	0	*	I just expect my president to be on top of things. But golfing and attacking the media is cool too.
t1_dsrqo8a	0	*	More or less he can do whatever he wants and he has your full support. Cool convictions bro. 
t1_dsrpp73	0	*	If you hate our oppressive capitalist nation so much... then why dont you immigrate to NK or China? Im sure those places would be communist utopias for you and welcome you with open arms. 
t1_dsrutvi	1	*	Nah Im good. 
t1_dssaurq	1	*	And comparing Trump to KJU is called fear mongering. Which is what you're doing. It's just plain foolish.

t1_dslmppm	1	*	073 067 085 080
t1_dslmbk3	1	*	Yeah it creates an awkward situation for representatives of our country abroad. 
t1_dsl11ut	1	*	yeah every single financially successful company in america does BS like that, sadly.  the only reason we know about wal mart is because as a people, we enjoy scapegoats.
t1_dsl32cf	1	*	I'm not shitting on anyone??? I hope...
t1_dsl0zcc	0	*	it's all good, my dude.  a lot of frustration going around and I didn't sense any maliciousness coming from your comments at all,  cheers mate!
t1_dsl3ykz	0	*	What exactly do you want? If more businesses are allowed to thrive then so be it. It's no worse than what has been the case for decades, are you saying you want the govt to redistribute the wealth?
t1_dsljbzd	0	*	Have a good day. :) 
t1_dslnees	0	*	What? I'm explicitly not insulting anyone. I'm referring to whatever they the previous poster was talking about, trying to get them to stop insulting people with blanket terms.
t1_dsl9udv	1	*	Lmao you replied and deleted your comment.   Where and when did I delete any of my replies? Do you need me screenshot you everything and show you or will you eventually come to your senses 
t1_dslg25a	1	*	Also U0001f619 is Ctrl+W
t1_dsl9bnh	0	*	Sigh, your logic just hit full circle.   It's funny, when you look in the mirror I bet you think you see a tolerant, open minded, enlightened person.
t1_ds9pofp	1	*	 Maybe Timmy should have gone rogue and start selling kebabs and falafels  
t1_ds9ng8p	1	*	To be fair you're clearly not all that bright, so yes luck did have a lot to do with it. 
t1_du2pvhs	0	*	Freedom fighters don't crash passenger jets into civilian buildings, but  terrorists do.
t1_dstf2lq	1	*	I'm sure that's super common
t1_dsmw239	0	*	Part of that is probably size too. Dogs are generally bigger than cats.
t1_dsmb48v	0	*	You meant fruit flies better than lobsters.
t1_dsm6dgd	1	*	Glad to be your inspiration! You have a very versatile tool that most people don't have. Use it to its limits! All sorts of amazing things can happen.
t1_dsnf7og	0	*	I dont think lobsters can live without their head.... 
t1_dsme182	0	*	They might be, I've never eaten fruit flies.
t1_du1fmru	1	*	Democracy stolen.
t1_dupv9md	0	*	Yeah because war makes money. They want countries to always be at war. 
t1_dupr43y	1	*	The original post bringing up race has been deleted so I don't know if it was you raising that point. Culture is a different topic, sure. 
t1_dttu29b	0	*	Retards who think imperalism is restricted to invasions aren't worth my time. Go play with the other special needs kids
t1_dtid0ni	1	*	In what way is the US a democracy?
t1_dulodjp	1	*	Youre right, they got rid of those unsightly towers in New York that everyone hated. 
t1_dum87b5	1	*	And they sold them the gas.
t1_dun5ysr	1	*	Ah thanks for explaining. I'm usually better at picking up on those.
t1_dulytp2	0	*	Ohhh too bad US could no longer influence us. Boofuckinhoo
t1_dulu97c	1	*	Great point, well thought out.
t1_dundxzd	1	*	What are you, some kinda hippie? We gotta get them before they get us! /s
t1_dumm0f4	0	*	So you're saying that it's sometimes ok to ignore judicial process and indiscriminately kill?
t1_duljmmb	1	*	Vietnamese sources claimed the PLA had suffered 62,500 total casualties. Small potatoes.
t1_duaphd0	0	*	What...does that have to do with anything. How does the person in plain clothes being trained have to do with how they look to the swat team that turns up?
t1_dua7h2p	0	*	It still allows for the sale of a gun between two private parties without a background check. 
t1_ds80pzw	0	*	> Considering Coco the ape literally asked to hold a cat with sign language  Not sign language. A sign language that her interpreter claims to speak with her.
t1_dsch8yx	0	*	unrelated. i stand by my conviction that white peoples have a right of existence just like any other population
t1_dsdaxfy	1	*	I don't think he was involved in many rapes.
t1_dscehmf	0	*	And then we have the US not prosecuting individuals that commit crimes on the Reservations, as they're not within the US' jurisdiction.
t1_dscd2tk	1	*	And no one else of course.
t1_dsbzknr	0	*	yes, it is, but encouraged by the Qurran
t1_dsce2un	1	*	You love what now?
t1_dsbxbxb	0	*	Go ahead and compare birthrates and get back to me
t1_dscfn9x	1	*	I'm not talking about how people in the country would react and I'm definitely not saying non-Western countries are less xenophobic. I'm talking about how anti-racists would react.
t1_dsc7qde	1	*	Er, no? Population fitness can be enhanced or harmed by non-breeding individuals. 
t1_dsg2pum	0	*	This is not a convincing response. I directly referenced the article, which does not agree with your point. Census data and the definition of majority also contradict your point. Have a good day.
t1_dscgevu	1	*	I misunderstood. It read to me like a way of rationalizing it away, in order to not focus on it, e.g, Yeah well people in general are shitty. My bad.
t1_dul1kf7	0	*	Planting trees isnt really the governments job... also this charity was started by the 1%.. save your money bucko.. or just dont pretend like youd ever give to charity

t1_duk1lo3	0	*	leaders have been taking credit for what their people do since the dawn of time. 
t1_dukhexi	0	*	As far as net neutrality, fine, that's called federalism.  As far as, immigration, the Constitution bestows that on Congress so that's not okay.
t1_dtgv4l9	1	*	Cool
t1_dtgsz5h	1	*	As someone who knows a lot of hunters, I would say ethical hunters outnumber the shitheads. In MN at least, but we have a great DNR and conservation/wildlife was brought up in school often
t1_dtgsi7z	1	*	Most hunters are also decent enough shots to kill the animal quickly. 
t1_dt3zqpm	1	*	Username checks the fuck out
t1_dtmrv1z	0	*	sounds like douche bag and turd sandwich still
t1_dupl7ly	0	*	Except it's in the EU and NATO, so Russia isn't able to take it. Real life isn't like a game of Civ, Russia declaring war on Germany would be the end of the developed world.
t1_duptb1q	1	*	I'll remind you that for over the last year, we Americans have been living in the era of Alternative Facts, but you're right, facts are facts.
t1_duq55d1	0	*	Congrats on feudalism?
t1_dupjrvd	1	*	Ah gotcha, my bad for misunderstanding 
t1_duq6abo	1	*	Yeah, that tells me you just have a different personality and aren't likely to get hooked. People have different brain chemistry though.
t1_dur2vrk	1	*	And it's not favorable in Finland either, you utter pillock. 
t1_dupntfs	0	*	You might be right, but I was turned off to the information by your attitude. 
t1_duq20ga	1	*	I cant do all the work for you. 
t1_duqcrl8	0	*	seriously though -> proceeds to make disparaging joke
t1_duq32fk	0	*	How would that change it? 
t1_dupfopz	0	*	I would say USA^2
t1_dtnglu5	0	*	You mean the commie that met with the founder of  Fusion gps the night before, the night after the meeting, and the day after?
t1_dtn24nc	0	*	No.  It is so weird the way Trump Voters think that the investigation and arrests concerning the Trump Campaign colludi g with Russians has nothing to do with Trump colluding with Russians. 
t1_dt6kqd4	1	*	Gangsta rap is a subgenre of hiphop, don't be delusional.
t1_dsruz7p	0	*	Don't be willfully ignorant.
t1_dugqfcl	0	*	It's time to end the DNC and GOP.  No one owes their vote to them, and the sooner people realize this the sooner we can elect a third party.
t1_duha5tn	1	*	Well they can't use the gun argument, he's a senator from Vermont
t1_duilsht	0	*	Holy shit please tell if you're actually this fucking retarded or just a really dedicated troll.
t1_duhszb4	1	*	Sorry, but awarding the victory to the winner of the votes is not rigging.
t1_dugqhz1	0	*	No they didn't?  [Have a read.](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/11/14/16640082/donna-brazile-warren-bernie-sanders-democratic-primary-rigged)
t1_duhu19v	0	*	Lol, the both sides are the same BS. Sanders and Clinton were 95% similar on policy, but Clinton actually had plans. 
t1_dugrbp2	0	*	Look at how divided the country became in his 8 years.  Income and wealth disparity grew significantly under his watch.  
t1_dugtt0v	0	*	No they're literally arguing that their voices should be worth more. It's completely unfair lol
t1_duhsvq6	1	*	> shit, if you gave the guy actual fucking funding to fun and a platform than he would have stood way more of a chance.  That's his problem. Clinton did that by herself. 
t1_dugoxl5	1	*	He bombed more innocent women and children than Franklin Pierce?!?!?! Man I thought he had that record all wrapped up 
t1_dugp9r9	0	*	Is this the entirety of the Republican attempt at defending their positions? Refusing to answer because of typos? 
t1_duguti2	1	*	> because hillary was shit and was about as exciting as a blowjob with teeth.  At least Monica knew what to do.
t1_dugysv8	0	*	My bad, Im about 4 whiskeys deep right now ha
t1_duiawpo	1	*	... Are you kidding? 
t1_dugoyup	0	*	I don't think that's true, Truman wiped two cities off the map with two bombs.
t1_dugt25g	1	*	YOU JUST MADE AN ENEMY FOR LIFE
t1_dugt259	1	*	[The national animal of Scotland is the unicorn, which has been a Scottish heraldic symbol since the 12th century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicorn#Scotland)
t1_duibnd2	0	*	What?
t1_dugvzp3	1	*	Jeez, sorry someone pissed in your cereal bowl this morning. Learn to accept that 6 million of us didn't like either major candidate and voted for who we wanted.
t1_dtlrct8	1	*	Awesome. Adding that to my rxe9sumxe9
t1_dtvy4zj	1	*	Made me chuckle a bit. Giving out multiple life sentences like the US does always seemed weird to me. Like, are you going to keep the prisoner alive for 400 years or something? 
t1_dtwfz1p	1	*	All roads lead to Slick Willy.
t1_duc5xui	1	*	Yes, you're right, but again, secrecy like that will harm the progress for the entire world. It can also escalate into other forms of conflicts if they don't back down.
