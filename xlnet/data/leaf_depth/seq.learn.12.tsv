t1_ds7ptpp	1	*	>You mean after 1939 right?  >>You made no other points.  ..........  OP shall surely respond.
t1_dtb68rj	0	*	What services does Boeing sell that make them more money than the profit on a plane? 
t1_dtciobf	1	*	You'll get over eh.
t1_dtc3vd5	0	*	Facts are true no matter how ignorant you are.  If you think a valid cirticism of you is ad hominem and gives you permission to believe in fake things, then you are quite stupid.
t1_dtcrm05	0	*	> repeated softwood lumber issue.  What happened?
t1_dtboejd	0	*	As a recent holder of a PPL, isn't 'tail-heavy' extremely dangerous? Thought it makes stall recovery near impossible. You can't point your nose down in a stall. 
t1_dui7bgx	0	*	People suspected that something was up, not everyone knew, some suspected. Now there's proof. 
t1_dunra6x	0	*	Nah, I just think that when most people misuse an idiom from 2000 years ago, maybe the battle has been lost. Just let it go, life goes on. 
t1_dunrl4d	1	*	Well, this comment chain started because people said corruption is legal in the USA. So yeah, you are correct. It still doesn't make it right tho.
t1_duaq18j	0	*	If you want to think so, okay. Adding another wrong thing to your pile of things you get wrong won't hurt too much.
t1_dueqx48	1	*	Henry Kissinger fought in WW2 
t1_dtovusd	0	*	Sure. Just wanted to give you a wee prompt to change.
t1_dtlkdgz	1	*	And Big John will be out of business because of legalization, correct? 
t1_dtll1sj	0	*	Yeah, full pill to 3/4, then 1/2, etc. One week to two between down sizing
t1_dtlvluz	0	*	Does kratom help or is that just hype?
t1_dtn1rr1	1	*	Yes, that's a good point. However much easier than the war on drugs.
t1_dtls4x4	1	*	I remember being very confused as a kid when the parties switched colors.  
t1_dtlknhf	1	*	This *is* the point entirely, in case someone was genuinely curious and not trying to be argumentative about this particular affliction.
t1_dtm5ohl	1	*	Hmm, sounds like Dengue Fever

t1_dubzysi	1	*	Doesnt Just cooking the meat save you from worms?
t1_duc2xso	1	*	\#notallrabbits
t1_dubnufv	1	*	yeah and theres a clear difference between their actions. They are not even comparable. 
t1_dubu3y5	0	*	Are these worms somehow immune to cooking?
t1_duc2add	0	*	So does cooking your fucking food.
t1_duc6dmj	0	*	This! While I agree with the original statement, if someone asks for proof they shouldn't get down voted. 
t1_duc7yro	1	*	Most of my friends joined the guard to pay for college and have been there for nearly a decade. Except for the who flunked out of college, he joined the Marines.
t1_dubs3ee	0	*	Uhhh...fucking what???? WORMS?

t1_dt665xg	1	*	Am I even arab? it seems like you showed your hand about posting this because you have some chip on your shoulder at arabs though at least. 
t1_dspil62	0	*	Pleasure engaging in some banter with you. Im done for the day. Au revoir.
t1_dt25ib5	1	*	That's exactly the kind of thinking that creates terrorists.  Great job kid, you're a traitor to your country.

t1_dt27c0u	0	*	I dont know whats wrong with peoples reading comprehension today. Youre good dude.

t1_dt3ej74	1	*	The balkans
t1_dufrgr4	0	*	Why would I make a deal with someone who wouldn't hold up their side of the bargain?  Yes or no.
t1_dufffe3	0	*	Keep posting articles from the CBC from 2011 that shows how respected they are. They are respected, they even say so! Not only that but it says nearly half don't support it. So respected! 
t1_duldy2z	1	*	Haha, that's rich. I love it when people spew unsubstantiated nonsense and demand citations.  I'm Danish. Please cite the laws regarding what I can or cannot talk about. 
t1_dufl2uy	0	*	Fair enough. But in my opinion basing any annexation on ethnicity of the local populace, especially when there's a history of ethnic cleansing is in bad taste. You obviously disagree.
t1_dui68pk	1	*	Yes, US is violating international law in Syria. That is wrong as well.
t1_dujgra6	0	*	Do you remember what happened after that? United Kingdom declares war on Germany. World war starts. United States gets sucked into it. That is why annexation is not allowed anymore.
t1_dugs4xq	1	*	> de facto   So even you admit its not legal, not recognised, not Russia.
t1_dujrom1	1	*	Bloody hell, I just paid xa3500 last month to extend my UK visa. Why didn't PropellerLegs just let me stay for free?
t1_duk49zt	1	*	Go on...
t1_dujgoon	0	*	How do you know that Israel can be considered a safe country for the 9 million people living here? Maybe we should all come to your country.
t1_dsvoz94	0	*	Do you have an authority to classify them as refugees?  I provided the definitions, so shouldn't be too hard.
t1_dsvytd8	0	*	Have you seen polls of 1940s germans?
t1_dsvxoau	0	*	Well Israeli migration authorities have proved it, and they're the only authority that rules on the matter.
t1_dswuzpw	0	*	It brings the value of the United States all the way down to zero.   Can't reap the benefits of freedom and liberty if you deny people the right to try for it. 
t1_dswoedc	1	*	Hmmm. Can't argue with that.
t1_ds90rlx	1	*	Tangent replies are multiplying 
t1_ds9atmx	0	*	I'm out of date on encryption for a quantum setting. I feel like it is likely to become very relevant in the near future. Do you have any good launching points for getting back into it?

t1_ds9y1f3	0	*	Maybe they have new ones do i haven't looked but mine has buttons not a wheel at the thumb. It has a normal middleclick wheel. A side wheel is pretty weird and awkward

t1_ds910s9	0	*	Square up guys we fighting 
t1_ds96wma	0	*	Muskster is too hard to pronounce to be useful in my life.   
t1_ds9ad5e	1	*	Exactly. [Shor's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor's_algorithm) could easily break RSA (and probably most other public key crypto) given a good enough quantum computer.
t1_ds9bdsg	1	*	Negative eleventeen
t1_dsawa7s	1	*	I am not part of the project so I can't speak for them, but I am sure they would be happy happy to help with the discovery of any new prime. The prime verification software works for any number. 
t1_ds9dwpe	1	*	What do you mean by a known prime, in this case? I can be fairly confident that nobody has used the prime 215,457,260,331,492,978,885,410,903,737,826,488,949 until just now. 
t1_ds9606s	1	*	How strange.
t1_ds9j74b	1	*	Then we would have the singularity.

t1_ds91i5h	1	*	Can I owe at how the two of you ended on a slightly funny and friendly tone?
t1_dust57z	1	*	Sarcasm doesn't convey well over the internet. See also Poe's Law.  If only we had punctuation to indicate sarcasm~.
t1_ds8zexj	1	*	Put a power to it then 
t1_ds9c2x7	0	*	> 3 is not divisible by 2  Yes it is. You can divide 3 by 2.   3 divided by 2 is 1.5.   It is divisible by 2.

t1_ds9bk7p	1	*	I knew the trick. did not know the shortcut. Sick.
t1_ds9bh4h	0	*	This is also false. Simultaneous is a very poor way of describing how quantum computation functions and just misleads people. 
t1_ds93yuy	1	*	Sure, it'd kinda weird if the RSA algorithm managed to discover a completely new prime.
t1_du39sq7	0	*	You're the one who arrogantly proclaimed the US was being left behind.  Now that we discuss your sentiment, it's me who is creating a conflict?
t1_du3c1r9	0	*	India would have support against China, at least.  You can't trust the Indian govt to protect your interests?
t1_du7gkyn	1	*	You are forgetting the fact that the US is not an island, it can be reached from both Canada and Mexico
t1_dtn4cb2	0	*	It's a youtube video made by someone with an agenda. It contains no factual evidence, but it contains a lot of bullshit.
t1_dsesj8e	1	*	And who are you to decide who can and cannot have nuclear weapons or authoritarian regimes? Self-entitled Americans, lol.
t1_dset1zm	0	*	They're not selling the humanitarian aid they receive. Can you read?
t1_du46dj2	1	*	I mean in comparison to the rest of the Olympics.
t1_dt0qiz1	1	*	Tens of millions? What the fuck are you talking about. Shoot me some links you fucking madman
t1_dt0qm4g	1	*	Globalism and free markets did, the US has been part of that
t1_dv28poz	1	*	What the hell are you even talking about? Nothing happening over there is ok.
t1_dv1s0wp	0	*	Nah I just hear this kind of bullshit all the time.Im sure its all Americas fault, Assad is an innocent victim of circumstance.

t1_dv2yrza	0	*	Oh all the radical Jihadis are gone? excellent!
t1_dulglgb	1	*	He sounds like one of those ignorant Americans who thinks of Africa as a monolith with zero diversity. 
t1_dum842s	1	*	Oh please go away. I could give 2 shits about your opinion. If you don't like my question posted to someone else, move on. Are you a child? Grow up.
t1_dsq5oil	1	*	Then you must hate yourself.  It actually makes a lot of sense.  Your a bigotted white kid living in his mom's basement whining about his tendies projecting on everyone in this subreddit.
t1_dsq7z2o	0	*	Yes they do pile up.  Each and every one is just one more example.  Doesnt matter when or where it happens.  Could be 5, 10, 20 years ago in a foreign country.  Doesn't matter to the masses.
t1_dsh79dx	1	*	Baby humans have this skill for awhile after they are born as well. Helps them not choke to death while they are guzzling milk.
t1_dsi4dqw	0	*	If.  But the factors that Pooperoni listed were behavioural, not genetic.
t1_dsh9rn8	0	*	Cow choke has nothing to do with choking though. There usually isn't any obstruction of the airway.
t1_dtf8ox1	1	*	LOL you people are psychos. Enjoy your club!
t1_dss6h4w	0	*	I am not commenting on the content of either OP or your comments. I am just saying no one here is providing any actual evidence. Everything here regardless of logic is hearsay. 
t1_dudxq7u	0	*	That's my point.  They aren't making fun of anybody.  But everybody will be offended.  
t1_dtxoew7	1	*	So brutally 90's lol. And I am aware that is unintentional.
t1_dv600vr	1	*	We have truly risen to a higher plain! 
t1_dsi21qd	1	*	not ta worry, the teenage thing,...... it will arrive,.... with its own lingo, codes and anarchy. Bright Future for suure;)

t1_dufkgn6	1	*	Several yes. Just never come across this view anywhere in country western Australia so very odd for me
t1_ds6o7uw	1	*	> https://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/25-years-on-anger-continues-over-ira-proxy-bomb-which-killed-six-1-7028628  Thanks! 
t1_ds6459j	1	*	bhai kyon gadhe se behas kar rahe ho...
t1_ds6fgdd	1	*	Agreed.
t1_dtl88uy	1	*	It's almost like basic economic laws don't hold any weight when it comes to real life.
t1_dtjss8w	1	*	I didn't say republicans. I said far-right. Surely you're not one of those people who considers anyone conservative to be far-right, are you?
t1_dtmlnly	1	*	That's... that's not like saying that at all.  It's like asking Holocaust survivors their opinion of the situation.
t1_dsf0nhc	0	*	I wasn't asking the opinion of others, I was asking yours. Did you read it or do you just let other people tell you what to think?
t1_dsti7b4	0	*	Again, the deal never included the colonization of the territory. The PA has always opposed to that, just like the rest of the world.
t1_dst9mpz	1	*	There are no daily shootings of innocent Palestinians only terrorists. They were cheering hamas being destroyed. Next. 
t1_dstvmb9	0	*	By that logic any civilians in Gaza are human shields
t1_dsti97q	1	*	What would he have to do, pay the families of terrorists? 
t1_dstfles	1	*	You see what kind of people we're dealing with
t1_dst9rwz	0	*	The IDF has said so.
t1_dutjum4	1	*	Yes, there is. 
t1_dutmbdm	1	*	It only takes a second of carelessness to change who you are forever. This isn't a statement about fear being important, just that is the reality of life.
t1_dutv73c	1	*	From the most part those places either don't exist or are significantly underfunded.
t1_dutl9d6	0	*	Is this before or after Bush put us in 2 never ending wars and killed millions?
t1_duthx58	1	*	Oh it would be hard AF, but totally worth it.
t1_duueezw	0	*	It's perfectly logical. Giving birth to a child like this is a net loss for all of humanity, from the resources and time required to keep it alive so that it will contribute nothing. 
t1_dutswrc	1	*	If there was no religion, wed all be subhuman slaves in some empire or another. 
t1_dutlgzc	0	*	I'm saying science can be proven wrong, but only by science. That's not a problem with science.
t1_duugvgw	0	*	Now Christians know how Muslims feel about Isis
t1_dutpxnt	1	*	Ever read snow crash?
t1_duuizq8	1	*	I'd argue people with your mentality are worse, and exactly like an anti-vaxer you'd probably see it differently. 
t1_dutpknu	1	*	I never said anything that contradicted what you said. 
t1_dutjw0q	1	*	Trust without verification is basically blind faith though. So as long as everyone everywhere makes sure that verification is part of the process then we're good
t1_duxjybw	0	*	If you really think I'm crazy, you must be an idiot, not able to think for himself, not realising that you are brainwashed by the propaganda machine.
t1_dutyh54	1	*	VACCINATE U0001f436 YOUR U0001f436FUCKING U0001f436 PUPS
t1_duu7quk	1	*	>not having anything to add precisely because you lack knowledge, ultimately meaning you only know how to follow popular opinion
t1_dutbxcb	1	*	Sure thing, give me executive power and ill go ahead and get started.
t1_dutprby	0	*	With the backing of effectively the entire medical community.  Don't be dumb.
t1_duu5vhp	1	*	But that isn't trust.
t1_dutjx4l	1	*	Yeah. Medicare/Medicaid for all will N E V E R work here until something is done about the insurance companies. And some other stuff. 
t1_duu0947	0	*	How bout it's their fucking kid and stay the fuck out of other people's business.  Fucking idiot. 
t1_duuja3t	0	*	Chicken pox is not extinct lol Second time I have saw this misinfo in this thread.
t1_duu6tal	1	*	It would probably be very expensive if it's anything like taking care of a dying old person. 
t1_dutt63p	1	*	This is far more sane.
t1_dutupfs	0	*	Youre clearly not american.   Ergo intelligent. 
t1_dutm82q	0	*	You completely missed that OP was _explaining_ this mindset, not _endorsing_ it, you ninny. 
t1_dutnxeg	1	*	It does if they were in Romania and not Italy... developed  adequate access to medical care.
t1_dutqwqr	0	*	And the testimonies?
t1_duty5ym	1	*	That's a fair point amidst the vaccination debate, imo.

t1_dv5m1wk	1	*	Great to hear! Continued good luck!
t1_dv5mfhj	1	*	Maybe a dodgy repair, the line was cut when we bought the house and they fixed it.
t1_dv4kyan	0	*	Ew, fuck Comcast. If you used a VPN could they still tell if you were torrenting? 
t1_dv4gxvm	1	*	This comment just reached us but was sent in 2015, I wonder what its like now?
t1_dv4bdez	0	*	Awesome name.   Also, 20 is more than most people on the NBN get in Australia.
t1_dv4kext	1	*	I've had up to 100mbps and that shit never went over 20mbps. Which worked of course, but now that I've been tainted by fibre, I don't want to go back. 
t1_dv4gjmm	1	*	How were you able to post dude
t1_dv4afnw	0	*	Just did a speedtest myself, maxed at 13mbps, thats my average high. I would kill for 20 up. Apparently all the lines are fine, its broken on my end according to Telstra. 
t1_dv4a0p1	0	*	Just tested my d/l speed here at my hotel in Nigeria. 1.8 mbps bitches. 270ms ping however. 
t1_dv4bgrw	1	*	Am Latvian. Can potato.
t1_dv4idvy	0	*	Let's not feed the troll, folks. 
t1_dv74x6y	1	*	Its not going to happen overnight, but they are rolling it out to some amazingly small towns, it'll get to them eventually, the plan is to get to around 87% or so.
t1_dv49bh5	1	*	Fuck it that cunt. 
t1_ds5dd4v	0	*	If they can prove theres a pattern of you paying women less for the same job as men, saying they didn't ask for a raise is basically admitting your guilt.  
t1_ds5dihn	0	*	Sure but if a black and white kid are both late and you only send the black kid to the principal your gonna have a bad time.
t1_ds5lslr	1	*	I am not advocating for paying everyone the same.
t1_ds5dpnf	0	*	Because we live in a country where everyone should be treated equally and have passed laws forcing people to do just that, one part of that includes pay based on gender.
t1_ds5i6n3	0	*	Because its private information. Stop asking.
t1_ds5hf60	0	*	You seem to think I want it to be a legal requirement that salaries are disclosed.  You are mistaken. 
t1_ds5jh22	1	*	Oh ok
t1_ds5iat0	0	*	I didn't downvote you.  I'm asking for examples of the trouble that it could cause. 
t1_ds5ibgp	0	*	The trouble.  Exactly what trouble could an ex knowing your salary info cause you?  I'm genuinely curious.
t1_dum3io3	0	*	You live in a society where the government can arrest you and murder you and get away with it scott free.  You okay with that?
t1_ds2i25j	0	*	I'm talking about the economies of entire nations. You seem to think there is no difference between the economy of a nation and knitting your own socks. Now think about it for a second man, c'mon. 
t1_dtiulg4	1	*	It's definitely center left. Dangerously left to Americans=anywhere left of center. 
t1_dtiadow	1	*	The last two that had decent turn out (one In the 70s) showed more not wanting to be a state.

t1_dto0q83	1	*	She's old enough to know better. So cry baby cry.

t1_dton6bb	0	*	...A toboggan is a sled. What the fuck, America.
t1_dtnz4hq	0	*	I don't think anyone was insulting for karma. Just stating that him simply being a billionaire isn't a sign of his better decision making abilities. 
t1_dtob1ex	1	*	No, I haven't. I've been criticizing bad arguments.
t1_dto0rvd	0	*	toboggans are sleds up here. if you call a beanie that up here you'll get very confused looks
t1_dtojcgk	1	*	Ok yeah, total piece of shit for sure. Maybe his bitching about hydro price and something resulting from it can be the minute silver lining.
t1_dto78i4	1	*	He didn't notice that the lights had changed
t1_dto13yu	0	*	How is t_d any more insane than r/politics or the 100's of anti-Trump subs?  Each one has content tailored to their base.  t_d is at least light-hearted, comedic, and not emo-doom-and-gloom 24/7.  
t1_dto4ajq	0	*	Here in the extreme south (Tasmania, the island to the south of Australia), we call them beanies. 
t1_dto52jc	0	*	Because I dont like income inequality?
t1_dtp10gt	0	*	I'm so ignorant I don't even know what you're trying to say.  We keep you ignorant and dying?  Please explain this statement for an ignorant American.

t1_dto3cbf	0	*	Sooooo, is that a never? 
t1_dtpvblt	0	*	The dollar has faceplanted somewhat in the meantime so I'm not convinced that's a stellar argument for the soundness of the pound. 
t1_dto4n3u	0	*	Has that worked out well so far? Our 2 party system seems pretty damn broken at this point, hopefully we'll see a third party gain some more footing after this past year.
t1_dto4e6i	1	*	incidently i he claimed credit for the good stock market, havent heard him claim credit for the worst close in 2 years yet?

t1_dumia7g	1	*	Cyka blyat
t1_dum7thj	0	*	So you've been posting explicitely pro-Putin articles for free this whole time?
t1_dux002q	1	*	>Russia is not an threat to US.  Well, that's a huge underestimation.
t1_dum39o6	0	*	You are projecting here. You don't know anything about him or where he's been. 
t1_duncr3b	1	*	So, how about you use an argument or any facts. You arent proving any kind of point or sounding in any way intelligent. It must suck having to go through life with such a tiny penis...
t1_dum0mli	0	*	You don't know anything about me vlad.

t1_du16qgs	0	*	Its gonna take a lot more guns, deaths, and bombs to change that place. You cant just throw money and the worthless State Department at the problem.
t1_dtzwwqm	0	*	The vast majority of military money goes to tech investment.  The high tech job losses would be insane and cause a catastrophe.  
t1_dtzved7	0	*	This is not an issue of misunderstanding....this is an issue of you been an unAmerican, weak, immoral individual on this matter.
t1_du0uk90	0	*	That isn't how budgets work.  You can't just halve a military like that.  Too many contracts. Too many towns and businesses that can just adapt in a year.  Too many liabilities like maintenance.  
t1_du04v60	1	*	Well we could probably start with dialing back our military. Seeing as we are starting wars for the sake of selling arms.
t1_durbobm	0	*	I'm not sure what are you talking about.
t1_durod3m	0	*	I can't believe you're even comparing death toll.   40000 is a ridiculous number of people raped or killed.
t1_durf852	0	*	We mustn't forget the horrid ear crimes.
t1_durb6zp	0	*	Which one?
t1_durc7sf	0	*	Ok i see. Good to know. I thought the education system would have the same structure throughout the country. 
t1_dutuajg	0	*	I'm sorry but WW2 is completely irrelevant to what happened these last years.  I'm a Greek too, so let's stop blaming others for the Greek economy. Greece did this to itself.
t1_durnnkb	0	*	If you think the nukes we're bad look up pictures of the Japanese cities we fire bombed. We wiped 4 cities off the map with firebombs before we ever dropped a nuke. 
t1_durr13h	0	*	Well surprisingly I think massacres in china is minor in comparison to what's happened in history of this world doesn't mean it ain't bad 
t1_durd06s	0	*	He's totally wrong.   I responded to him with the wiki article if you're interested
t1_durkidi	0	*	FDR didn't drop the bomb. He just signed off on developing the bomb. 
t1_durhu0t	1	*	Ear crimes 
t1_durtmn7	0	*	What does that have to do with anything? I never said that those actions were not immoral.
t1_durcisy	1	*	I remember the two WW were definitely the most interesting topics for me in history class. I guess it also depends on what the teacher like to teach, might impact the delivery as well.
t1_durbta0	0	*	 I doubt Germany had a hand in instigating it. I'm sure the USA did the lion share, but I'm judging that only on past experiences...I might perfectly be wrong.   
t1_dursvv5	1	*	the Us still has not held itself accountable for agent orange , napalm and the nukes. Using nuclear waste bombs in Iraq and selling saddam chemical weapons. Oh well!
t1_durc6zz	0	*	It was Stalin who was quoted as saying the war was won with American Steel, British intelligence and Russian blood.
t1_dusn3f1	1	*	Love it.
t1_durlz3q	1	*	> i have always hated the sooners even more  as a nebraska fan, same
t1_dur9204	0	*	You say massive, but the number of total refugees is hardly earthshattering. The number that are 'fake' is a smaller portion of that number.
t1_dur9ncr	0	*	No worries your comments have been quite interesting and thought-provoking. thanks. 
t1_duri31e	1	*	Ah those would usually be called workshop classes here. At least in NE USA. 
t1_durwrkp	0	*	You want to modernize the launch sequence? With how everything modern has to be in the cloud, I hope that never happens. 
t1_dutebda	1	*	that *is* pretty horrendous
t1_durht87	1	*	The Chinese still don't forgive them.  I've been to Nanjing (Nanking, in the 30s) and while it is built up now, knowing that so many countless atrocities happened there is crazy to me.
t1_durfvpp	0	*	If the firebombing of tokyo wasnt enough to get them surrender, what other show of force would have been, assuming they didnt surrender after the capture of manchuria?
t1_duswta2	0	*	Please tell me your not trying to advertise or recruit people to religion?
t1_durbli9	1	*	I've been binging on WWI videos on YouTube since I started playing the game. The tide of war could have turned either way so many times.
t1_durd63l	1	*	lol no it was, I was just making fun of Mel Gibson (The Jewish hate thing) and Spielberg (Indiana Jones)
t1_durlslc	0	*	You literally just joined the thread, made a personal insult at me because I criticised the US, and then decided you deserved an apology. The only stupid one here is you.
t1_durmi8d	1	*	Literally all I said is that it's the worst thing done by the Allies, but not even close to the worst in the war. Why are you denigrating the deaths of innocent European men, women, and children?
t1_duyx7ad	0	*	You don't seem too interested in seeing eye to eye here. I'm gonna leave you to your anger and attitude problems.
t1_durgu1e	0	*	Can you back your claim of a massive surge of fake refugees up in any way? 
t1_durfrgu	1	*	Does this mean Hitler considered himself a Truther?
t1_durbmui	1	*	what do you mean? The USA exported democracy and freedom as per usual...
t1_durolz1	0	*	Like I said if that makes you angry I suggest for you to quickly get over it.
t1_durcyz6	0	*	Chill guys. You all are probably arguing while pooping about WWII. its too early for this shit.
t1_dus703t	0	*	10s of millions is all im questioning
t1_dus4jga	1	*	My apologies. Collective punishment as defined by the fourth Geneva conventions in 1949 occurred after the attacks in 1945, and therefore did not apply.   What, specifically, am I wrong about? 
t1_dsfgb4t	0	*	But why? Why the public? Who apply the law? The public or the judge? Nobody gives a single fuck about the public here. It's a matter between Apple and the French justice. Sit back and watch.
t1_dsf012v	1	*	Yes, of course. Also, I realize I didn't answer your question. The production of the batteries isn't as bad as other options since recycling is possible. 
t1_dshburh	0	*	Its what the current system is, basically.  There are some spot audits but again it wouldn't be different from the current system - which in fact does work acceptably well.
t1_dsh91it	0	*	Where did I say mass genocide?
t1_dsumbne	0	*	Fighting the war on drugs clearly has not worked out for the USA. Would you consider another course of action?
t1_dtbhpfp	0	*	any chance you can tell me what to google to find a video of that interview? that sounds like an interesting thing to watch
t1_dtchqk4	1	*	Yeah the fish rots from the head down. That's my feeling anyway. 
t1_dtbhmpz	0	*	money = power (= time)      
t1_dtgmohn	1	*	Liars watch out! You might not get invited to this guys echo chamber
t1_dtfiu49	1	*	Fair enough argument I suppose. 
t1_dtfqsqh	1	*	My comment itself was effed up, so I'm with you.
t1_dthio5a	0	*	Feel free to point out what I said that was untrue, or run away in shame like the other guy.
t1_dtfvfml	0	*	wasn't is buzzfeed? lol  was made (the question)  I remember talking about it with a coworker before Oct 12th 2016 when I left that job  some bitch released the text Jan '17
t1_dtg8fpb	1	*	And I guess your type is going to act like there's nothing here and make ridiculous attempts to rationalize what happened. Textbook leftist behavior.
t1_dtg0y7d	0	*	But for anyone to believe that at this point, is incredibly naive. Is it possible? Sure, but incredibly unlikely.
t1_dtgzaxi	0	*	It's a Joe Rogan joke fam  I did vote for Trump, don't think he's infallible but I think this stuff is getting ridiculous. Carter Page getting contacted by a spy does not mean he is a spy. Get real
t1_dtg6zsu	0	*	Usually the burden of proof, and not that fake news kind, is on the person making the claim. Sad...
t1_dtft4oj	1	*	Until the facts come out, I won't make up my own narrative.   I'm done now. So don't waste any more keystrokes.
t1_dtp1pxj	0	*	Well, whatever, I think what I'm saying is more important than that news snippet, but this conversation could still be a misunderstanding.  Peace.
t1_dt2sinc	0	*	Haha try this one it always works wonders for me: You are all just Turks who think theyre Italian   Where are you from and where are you visiting in Turkey?
t1_ds7k7hk	1	*	you're alright, my man
t1_ds4picc	1	*	aww thanks mum
t1_ds510bc	1	*	no they were open to *freezing tests*  it's called a freeze-for-freeze and has been proposed by both china and north korea in the past 
t1_ds6u4rf	1	*	That's certainly an opinion.
t1_ds4jsp2	1	*	You are a good mine of NK trivia! That's actually hilarious!
t1_ds5d96g	0	*	> Being colloquial or slang doesn't delegitimize word use  Kinda does though. 
t1_durhk11	0	*	They both look much more like the actual Joan.
t1_duox4ep	0	*	This is the first I've heard of this parade. I think the girl playing her should resemble Joan of Arc as closely as possible.
t1_duok8ab	0	*	None of this drives me insane, but I know bad casting when I see it.
t1_duom4zx	1	*	How many black frenchmen were there during Joan of Arc's time? 
t1_dti9nyu	1	*	Fair enough. Illegal immigrants
t1_dtibnqm	0	*	Lol yes actually. But no Ive never tried it
t1_dti9tul	1	*	Except the ones from the shit hole countries. They can stay where ever the fuck they are. /s
t1_duucff9	1	*	Yeah, you're probably correct.
t1_du9ehkd	0	*	It's not about speech but about science and fact trumping religious nonsense.
t1_du9agxa	1	*	The only difference is one has the problem of mass violence for not giving into their demands... So you see religion as more of a hostage situation?
t1_du8i3j9	0	*	I'm a vegan
t1_du8hv30	1	*	I can talk about the precise situation in the Netherlands, and here only the kids are entitled to a legitimate portion. Article 4:63 & 4:64 BW. 
t1_du9u0dr	1	*	You dropped this \   ***   ^^To ^^prevent ^^any ^^more ^^lost ^^limbs ^^throughout ^^Reddit, ^^correctly ^^escape ^^the ^^arms ^^and ^^shoulders ^^by ^^typing ^^the ^^shrug ^^as ^^`xaf\\\_()_/xaf`
t1_du8kbda	1	*	Or maybe we can get on the Senate donor list?
t1_du8kdfe	1	*	Is that to say that a lot of people believing something for a long time is sufficient to make it valid?
t1_du8t5pz	1	*	 What are you on about? Not wanting the wrong people to benefit from something is the most usaian thing i can think off. He'd fit right in.    
t1_duaf5ab	0	*	*political, military, technology and medical powerhouse.
t1_du8exy9	0	*	Taxed at 40% in the UK!  Still, it'd certainly prevent all the wealth from being kept in the family line. U0001f60b
t1_du92hch	0	*	Religious ideology shouldn't impact public policy. End of story. 
t1_du9415j	0	*	Yes you are. If you are, for whatever reason, fundamentally against your organs being used for donating you are forced to opt out. Nobody was ever forced to opt in. 
t1_du8qsr9	1	*	Thanks to Hillary, here we call Democrats - corrupt. The party used to stand for something a long while back but the amount of corruption and media bias is just too much. 
t1_du8yuvz	0	*	Were talking a single dollar here man, one time expense. Dont make it seem so difficult. 
t1_du8svw1	1	*	My actions or opinions should not effect the lives of others by any means.  Once again ,i am referring to illegal settlers that cause conflict. 
t1_du8in6p	1	*	Thank you.
t1_duagdhq	0	*	> Nobody is entitled to other peoples body parts.  They should be.  > No way- even if I need a heart tomorrow I am not owed one.  Which is a shame, and part of a broken system.
t1_du8yqg8	1	*	perfect, Ill reference this comment in my defense for whenever I inevitably go to trial! 
t1_du8w4wh	1	*	All but too true. Sometimes you gotta laugh the pain away
t1_du8skr6	0	*	...he's joking about how he would be in prison if he killed his whole family
t1_du91qvn	1	*	en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentum_ad_populum
t1_du8i22n	0	*	Shit you could even hide it in your boobies
t1_du9bftl	0	*	If donating yours means so much opt in.
t1_du8nhe6	0	*	So it's not moraly wrong to be opted-out automatically when you wouldn't mind donating, but it is to be opted-in while still having the choice to opt-out? 
t1_du9u8g2	0	*	Because, once again, doing what  I want with my own body makes me a cunt...right.
t1_du8hvgx	1	*	That's what I meant. However, what is isn't necessarily what matters. Someone has to interpret that you are braindead and that's where mistakes can come in.  
t1_du8gzut	0	*	Guess we should just leave people to rot at the exact place where they died, unless they specifically consent for their body to be moved and prepared for a funeral.  
t1_du8gxub	0	*	Absolutely. American republicans would be considered far-right nutjobs here, and would be ousted from viable politics.
t1_du8hqm6	1	*	Interesting concept. 
t1_du9b3yx	0	*	Not to the government but your corpse is up for grabs. If anyone has a good purpose for it like organ donation why not let them recycle the remains
t1_du911rg	0	*	>I feel like you're underestimating how large the cult following is.   How ironic coming from a red hat cultist.
t1_du8fmsq	0	*	You'll also get dead dogs, kids, neighbors, etc and be unable to punish the cops for cold-blooded murder. Still interested? 
t1_du8gwav	1	*	There are only two options. Either way you go, that is a choice. I've already clarified my views of bodily integrity in another response. 
t1_du9rgbs	0	*	Not making a choice is making a choice. You said you had no choice, but you do. You have two choice. To **ACT** or to **NOT ACT**. I don't understand what point you're trying to get across.
t1_du8ge61	0	*	It's the only being able to choose based off medical reasons that's important to me, and thus far that's how the system, even in the US, has always worked.
t1_du9cav1	1	*	Yeah, one has a government thatd let people die on the chance that a dead person may once have cared.  The other saves lives.
t1_dtq2qs9	1	*	>you got upset that someone called fox news propaganda.  No, I disagreed because someone called Fox news *literally government propaganda* which is blatently untrue.  
t1_dtp5o3g	0	*	Maybe try reading the memo and fact checking it yourself and not just parroting right-wing radio
t1_dtqoalf	0	*	Alright so don't make an argument. Who cares about your time. Stand in the way of free speech though and watch what happens. The 2nd amendment is there to protect the 1st. 
t1_dtp61ca	1	*	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-governmental_organization  They play vital roles in areas such as IR, human rights, etc. Organizations like Amnesty International fall into the category.
t1_dtp66ek	0	*	That's not what the article says at all. 
t1_ds4xot9	0	*	Oh my god seriously?? *It was a defensive war for the US*. Attacking Canada was a *secondary goal*. It wasn't required in order to defend the US.
t1_dul3vt1	1	*	If its a posh Englishman probably. 
t1_dulboqs	0	*	Cause he has wu in the name makes him Chinese? Guess your a a chuckie doll or something
t1_dumlqxo	1	*	Haha good one.
t1_dum2v09	1	*	Ok... hmm i thought you did. Well thats enough of this if you don't mind. anyhow, goodnight. I'm surprised by the lack of downvoting btw, cool.
t1_dum4juq	1	*	That's some fancy copy and pasting you got going on there. 
t1_dsll5am	0	*	There are people abusing legal immigration. There are also downsides on immigration, too.  OMG ARE YOU SAYING WE SHOULD LOCK DOWN OUR BORDERS COMPLETELY?!?!?!
t1_dskqkty	0	*	Absolutely not. It should be properly enforced.
t1_dsma51v	0	*	If they are, why are they trying to emigrate to the US?  How do you know I haven't?
t1_dskt73z	0	*	I dont care what your opinion is.
t1_dskm9ac	0	*	So provide an explanation to the other people reading this thread who are not IYO trolls.  Or haven't you got anything?
t1_dsks9t4	1	*	Thanks for your contribution. Stay warm out there!
t1_dskmij7	0	*	Why would he do that? His relationship with Modi is A+. We just dumped Pakistan because India wanted us to. 
t1_dskqlm2	1	*	I was gonna go with shootings in general but then someone would say it's just poor areas.
t1_dskmet4	1	*	OVER MY DEAD BODY here you go that'll be $10.
t1_dsklruh	1	*	Specifically, its when the barista gets their order wrong. Their words arent that bad, but their tone of voice is like...mean. 
t1_dsxukbl	0	*	They can try a non union job?
t1_dsxwvrw	1	*	Aw.  Thanks, buddy.
t1_dsxwqim	1	*	Probably both guilty of that, to be fair.  I still think it's hilarious when some kid who got rich on grandma's Apple stock lectures me on Marxist theory.  
t1_dt2p77j	1	*	Yes but, this is how democracies work.  You make your choices, and you get one guy (or company) who is speaking on behalf of the whole country.
t1_dsxxt64	0	*	> USA is not one of those places, not today.  This thread is predominantly about Canada.
t1_dsxu694	1	*	Lmao. Thanks man, needed the laugh. 
t1_dsys8xf	1	*	Whooooosh!
t1_dsxvga4	1	*	Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh what?
t1_dsxnl4b	0	*	I dont care that youre renouncing socialism. Youre too stupid to impact anything.
t1_dsxwtjq	0	*	You said that Losing benefits is not a pay cut. That is technically incorrect. You tried to mislead by equating pay in  in the phrase pay cut entirely with wages.   
t1_dsy74n6	0	*	I wasn't aware that the Protocols of Zion were actually taken seriously anymore.
t1_du12sxi	1	*	Dude pass on the pics to me, Jalal here
t1_ds3vfac	0	*	Solar powered delivery drones? you're really fucking with me now. Take a science class.
t1_ds3rmi5	1	*	Sure, where are they?  Oh, they will be there in 5... 4... 3... 2... 1... 
t1_dtvc6dx	0	*	Nope. You're the one whom made claims first. I'm just pointing out the obvious. Good try though.
t1_dsohk8c	0	*	If I deposit xa35 into my account now and xa35 later I'll have more than the guy who deposited xa310 in one go. You're right it's infallible logic.
t1_dtwj711	1	*	I'd consider Cow and Chicken more of a reason to kill and eat cows and chickens. 
t1_dtxqlle	0	*	Cornell Law school. 
t1_dtvpmkm	1	*	Seems a lot of people share this personifying emotional argument, rather than an ecological one.  I wonder what the cow is thinking when they put a bolt in her head? 
t1_dtvmidg	0	*	Since we are all googling things today why don't you google about how much of the vegetables and land goes into feeding farmed animals? Have a nice day.
t1_dtwedlf	1	*	Yeah, that's a really apt comparison there hehe.
t1_dtvhcz4	0	*	Pigs are also fine with eating other pigs, so I'm not sure they'd have an objection until they realize they're next.
t1_dtx1umd	0	*	We also keep our human patients NPO after midnight for pretty much all surgeries. Way easier to work on them
t1_dtvo3kd	1	*	Woah woah woah, don't tell me you forgot about Gordy!?
t1_dtxhkco	0	*	If disaster-struck countries started selling child slaves to raise money to help families, would you support that? Evilness doing good in the aggregate, right?
t1_dtvfm90	0	*	when I see someone hunting a defenseless animal with a modern weapon, I want to see someone else come along and turn that same tech on the bully. That's 100% of hunters right there.
t1_dtxjhsv	1	*	So entirely different...  Thanks for the clarification.
t1_dtvop2w	1	*	Not from a singular, relatively short, exposure to stress. 
t1_dtvnyc0	0	*	Humans have an inherently unfair advantage against nature due to our intelligence. I won't sacrifice my enjoyment of the outdoors to appease your standards of morality.
t1_dtvi803	1	*	Not just the men
t1_dtvgf3b	1	*	He doesn't have a stance on hunting, just a stance against meat-eaters.
t1_dtvsr09	0	*	Ok? I'm unsure what that has to do with my comment. If you like to eat lion, find some sustainable lion to eat.
t1_dtvmlav	0	*	>This was a canned hunt
t1_dtvfuht	1	*	Air and empty convictions?
t1_dtvq89z	0	*	Lol, am I supposed to be threatened by you? 
t1_dtvgfxf	0	*	Really? I thought it was a monster movie
t1_dtvpenv	1	*	Lol, everyone? Your privilege is showing.
t1_dtvh216	1	*	Read it again slowly
t1_dtx2hi7	0	*	Nope, I'm in Australia. I mean there are some dingoes getting around I guess but we have control strategies in place for them and wild pigs (which damage our crops) 
t1_dtvsrx2	1	*	If you can catch and kill me first. Go ahead.
t1_dtxhltp	0	*	If disaster-struck countries started selling child slaves to raise money to help families, would you support that? 
t1_dtvgkxr	0	*	I believe there's nothing wrong with killing animals as long as it's done for a purpose and with respect.
t1_dtvwdvp	0	*	It's a technically possible thing. Use your mind, not your lulz
t1_dtxul4n	0	*	That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. How is my vote not a vote for Hillary because I didn't vote for Trump? My vote is for who I cast it for
t1_dtvuvpj	0	*	He's saying other than taste the values in meat can be gained elsewhere. Not that it has no other values.
t1_dtvfehb	1	*	My apologies friend. I should learn to read better.
t1_dtwfq4d	0	*	It's such an obvious fucking name but people just ignore it. 
t1_dtvlb9z	1	*	I really don't want to see this movie because I've already seen shit like Earthlings, and other horrible shit. I know Okja is fiction, but I know how my heart crushes at this type of shit.
t1_dtvmibt	0	*	I wouldn't want to be killed and eaten, but I wouldn't really care if you killed and ate someone else.
t1_dtvmkf5	0	*	Also Charlotte's Web, Foghorn Leghorn, Porky Pig, the list goes on.  That guy watched the Lion King once and has no idea what the hell he's talking about.
t1_dtw2mbz	0	*	I don't believe genetically weak animals have intrinsically less value. Don't put words in my mouth. Animals which we created have less value than wild animals. Eugenics is not unique to humans.
t1_dtvgj6c	1	*	Like l said it's ceremonial but it's still very dangerous for the man because bulls are very powerful even when stabbed before 
t1_dtvo04c	0	*	Sadly not everyone lives in a similar level of modernity. Meat provides an extremely protein- and fat-dense food source that requires (relatively) little work. 
t1_du6y57l	1	*	Thanks for correcting me :)
t1_dtvmwir	0	*	Just because you call it food, doesn't make it ok.
t1_dtveucw	1	*	No, and neither is killing helpless wild animals who have no chance to fight back for the pleasure of rich assholes.
t1_dtvmp4q	0	*	Problem is, I hate beans and stuff like that.
t1_dtvpp86	0	*	You're really wrong on a lot of fronts buddy. This comes from a guy who relishes salmon and chicken.
t1_dtw5of4	1	*	I mean, I have watched videos about slaughterhouses, I just haven't seen anything on the process leading up to that.
t1_dtvf8b9	0	*	What show? Sounds funny 
t1_dtvicmg	0	*	Prairie dogs are cute as hell, too. one of my friends hit one on the way to work a few years back. he was on a bicycle :(
t1_dtvg2z0	1	*	I've seen someone go HAAM with an AR-15 on a bunch of boars and they honestly didn't seem to mind. It was creepy. 
t1_dtvh7x1	0	*	No, you're wrong. Killing him saves humans. I'm arguing human life is more valuable than animal life. Killing Hitler saves humans in your scenario so it's a no brainier. Nice try though
t1_dtvp63f	1	*	you don't have the authority to make that judgment about other people.
t1_dtvhmhs	1	*	Chickens and cows too.
t1_dtvdr4h	0	*	yeah, that hunting and tracking experience is going to be dependent on how big the area the lion is confined to. 
t1_dtvkqpz	0	*	Oh, so when a policeman apprehends a criminal, and a court sentences them to prison, it's fine, but when I slap a random old lady in cuffs and stash her in my cellar it's 'bad'? How *'untennabke'*!
t1_dtvs0qk	0	*	Having less kids is a good way to reduce the spending.
t1_dtvmcxr	0	*	in all seriousness most of my meals look like [this](http://trainwithlyzabeth.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/veganbowlsquare-45461.jpg)
t1_dtviglh	1	*	Ya try it on zippo fluid...
t1_dtviijv	0	*	you're wrong. lashing out at me personally sure makes you seem right. 
t1_dtvkgip	1	*	Keep it cool Percy, you can do this, I know they've slaughtered all your friends, but maybe they'll spare you? Make your case, y'know...  *Last pig in line*  Oink?
t1_dtvi40y	0	*	You put em in the soup.
t1_dtvmm62	0	*	I'm not sure a discussion on ethics of killing animals is a matter of what the the animals think.
t1_dtvjamj	0	*	I know Melania doesn't much care for the pig in the city.
t1_dtvoakl	0	*	thats a human thing.. 
t1_dtvkmw4	0	*	I want a Sunny island where we all just yell Sunny quotes at each other, you goddamn bitch.
t1_dtveh38	1	*	Bru, you can apply the same logic to all sorts of people as well. You don't need a reason to *not* kill, that's the freaking default.
t1_dtvgv41	0	*	I'm not saying it's a bad thing that shouldn't be done, just saying that it's nothing to be proud of. 
t1_dtvqg4d	0	*	The episode of Always Sunny called Mac and Dennis: Manhunters
t1_dtvhs1j	1	*	yeah, I was small but I instinctively avoided that guy. he frightened me. 
t1_dtvv0b0	1	*	It's from a show, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia. Highly recommend
t1_dtvogkj	0	*	That assumes a meat company cares more about meat packers than profit. I find it hard to believe. 
t1_dtvtvuy	1	*	Because of the implication...
t1_dtvs4wz	1	*	Yeah, not being fed for 24 hours isn't starving them. You're a rude person who can't handle a discussion without being insulting.
t1_dtvwwtj	0	*	Your mind was never open. Too busy telling us all how things are here in Africa. From across the ocean.   You can keep your pity. I have no need of it.
t1_dtvkwo3	1	*	It's not that you need to eat a lot of protein, it's that you can eat 1/3 less protein rich food when you do eat and get the same amount of nutrition.  Hence why I said efficiency. 
t1_dtvg4y5	0	*	Them too.
t1_dtvnavt	1	*	Are we friends? Friends with the Benedicts?
t1_dtwi5r4	1	*	obviously the poacher is :|
t1_dtvfm41	1	*	Yeah. Just watched this one last night, these are all different scenes. 
t1_dtvnply	1	*	Those are food.
t1_dtvpaa1	0	*	Dude KFC though
t1_dtvd4x9	0	*	yeah im not identifying my reddit user name to my name IRL...
t1_dtvk8aq	0	*	That I can understand. It makes a certain kind of sense. It's the trophy hunting aspect, or the wacko stamina theories that bewilder me. I just don't see the need.
t1_dtvxp55	0	*	Dumbest argument ever. Straight dumb. The lion isn't eaten. If I went around killing cows for fun and not eating them people would be outraged.
t1_dtwai64	1	*	Yeah, cool. Thanks for explaining and discussing! :)
t1_dtvqsnj	1	*	Ok,Ill rephrase it: what are you gonna do after you killed said lion? Do you eat it? Or are you killing it for shits and giggles?
t1_dtvsls5	1	*	Depends on your definition of sentient
t1_dtvff37	1	*	Google hunter meat waste fine and there are many articles like this one.  www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/Texas-Hunter-Fined-for-Wasting-Moose-Meat-296209011.html
t1_dtvg63m	1	*	Fuck off people don't abstain from meat to feel better about themselves
t1_dtvngxs	1	*	im not denying that i wouldnt know 
t1_dtvd97j	0	*	> it's such as small percentage   source? see that's the problem- I don't think there *would* be legitimate sources on this.  
t1_dtvjlmw	1	*	>like humans do.  Your floundering and desperation do you no favours.
t1_dtvo8vq	0	*	Not in the same league as Simba + friends
t1_dtvmwk5	0	*	You'd be fine with no car at all.
t1_dtvo1yu	0	*	The whole discussion revolves around something that happened in Africa.... 
t1_dtvnqbt	0	*	Why are they not equivalent?
t1_ds39c51	0	*	So you are asserting that being a  tourist qualifies yourself as a major expert of Okinawan history and culture?
t1_duw40ad	1	*	Maybe everything in India really _is_ 'so stunning'.
t1_duvtkah	0	*	Uh is there any science to what you're saying? Like isnhuman shit actually more harmful? 
t1_duvnoh3	0	*	Or they just figure downstream is where the poor folk live
t1_duwc4tz	1	*	Can't help with the internet but if you fancy spending a few months in the wilderness around Hassi R'mel you'll see it plenty.
t1_duvtdy1	0	*	Its cool but so so dirty.  
t1_duvzuha	1	*	Birth control is just a natural human hormone given off during pregnancy.   You are talking about maybe a thousand shits a week over  hundreds of km here and not mounds of shit.
t1_duwh6rh	1	*	That's that thyroid guy right? They had a video together.  
t1_duwit8y	1	*	That's what made the most sense to me. More things like this would be awesome!
t1_dtl5f2f	0	*	Yup, its is so sad that the very people who are so poor,  voted in the incompetent, who have now screwed them solidly?
t1_ds3hwod	0	*	I'm not the one who said I was gonna block you so I can reply all I want, it's you that can't let it go.
t1_ds3hqo1	0	*	It takes one to know one :P 
t1_dsw3zdl	1	*	If you dont know what a business is then you are pretty far behind to even understand that not all businesses are the same
t1_du8q3tc	1	*	NO ageist.
t1_dsia6aw	1	*	India has almost 1 billion more inhabitants than America, so that's to be expected. And there's definitely more than just one doctor doing disgusting things in America.
t1_duq4tt8	1	*	Itself, like every other self governing city state. 
t1_duxao5u	0	*	Actually, the question is *whose facts.*
t1_dsku9bx	0	*	I can hate or like whoever I choose. Lol. 
t1_dsm0ffa	0	*	Would happily pay %25 more to know that Americans are benefiting.
t1_dtc8b38	1	*	Sure, after Trump signed it late.
t1_du71zda	0	*	Totally understand what you're saying, and not arguing that at all. I was just trying to prevent someone from thinking that we are only 10% effective and are hitting *only* civilians.
t1_du6o4p2	0	*	Actually, according to the International Court of Justice, you're completely wrong. See my comment above.
t1_du7ylld	1	*	And USA should be forever divided after their civil war. Ok.
t1_dsjyjc2	0	*	True.  It's a none threat to a military base or warship.  Soft target maybe. But better weapons exist in that case.
t1_dsjydq8	0	*	Ah yes, because such weapons are so readily available!  I'm sure something like that exists, but if it was available in that quantity, don't you think they'd be using it already?
t1_dsfh9t7	0	*	It's a good argument, but paragraphs would help. 
t1_dse1jly	1	*	Well, both Japanese and Vietnamese have Chinese roots.    in Chinese is er shi pronounced arr shihh meaning 20. 
t1_duq1buo	1	*	yeah, america is fucked in terms of gun control. 
t1_duonzlx	0	*	Nice straw man. He didn't say they were capitalists. He said they weren't socialists. Not that definitions matter to you, but that's true by the actual definition of socialism.
t1_duofban	0	*	Thankfully we live in advance civilized society, in which the needs of the many outweights the selfishness of a few individuals.
t1_duosox2	0	*	*facepalm* you're not worth bothering with. The constant muddling of definitions is pathetic.
t1_dunov6s	0	*	Well America has always been about free labour, maybe now that you pay them an absolute pittance you think you can have a clean conscience 
t1_dunhgb6	1	*	Yeah, false information to stop further torture
t1_dunu8xi	0	*	Thank you for the link. Does this not give credence to what I said then? About both sides being guilty? About how the left could have been corrupted in this exact manner just as the right was?
t1_dunwmdh	0	*	Yes, that's the only response your example warranted
t1_duo45z1	0	*	I would support this type of process in our elections, but I think there would have to be a change in our constitution to allow this to happen. 
t1_dunkpnc	0	*	>Where did I make assumptions about you?  When you said this.  > I am gonna  assume you are a shitty person      
t1_duobcxq	0	*	Retraining to what? More jobs that will just be swallowed up by outsourcing and automation?
t1_dunng0g	1	*	You're not going anywhere. Why don't you actually make an effort to argue your points by using facts instead of deflecting like someone who can't even hold a conversation
t1_dungv9l	0	*	Yes, you're wrong and clueless. Period.
t1_dunzwef	0	*	People who don't understand realpolitik are the actual problem.
t1_dunnuev	1	*	his argument sounds eerily familiar,   if you keep getting sexually assaulted maybe you should pay more attention to what you wear when you go out.
t1_dunt5cz	0	*	I think I described parts of both sides.  The worst parts to be sure.  Those parts seem to be getting all of the attention.  
t1_duq864a	0	*	Wait.  its Kay? Thought it was K
t1_dunqp0z	1	*	Wanting controlled borders is hardly analogous to wanting to own other people though. That's an apples and oranges comparison.
t1_dupalue	1	*	Its a private organisation that can set whatever rules it wants.  And it DID cater to the wishes of their voter base. Hillary won by a fucking landslide.
t1_dunhutz	1	*	> I said terrorists deserve no human rights, something that most people will agree with.  Until you are declared a terrorist, then anyone can do anything to you.
t1_dunkzsy	0	*	In what way is Bernie Sanders, of all people, a Marxist?  And in what way is he deranged?
t1_duntb66	1	*	This system does not exist at the federal level of US elections.  Not saying it's a bad idea or wouldn't be an improvement, just that it doesn't exist currently for us.
t1_dunuvp3	0	*	Are you including underdeveloped countries as if that's relevant?  What is relevant about comparing a first world country's political spectrum to anything but a developed country?
t1_dunrjwo	0	*	If the people working in the coal mining field didn't want to work those jobs or wanted the field gone we wouldn't be having this conversation right now because no one would be upset about it.
t1_dunoa4m	1	*	Some people blindly look over the second part. Some don't have empathy, and some do have empathy but just not for brown people. 
t1_dupmxxi	1	*	I literally wrote that Arpaio called it that himself (proudly). And I agree with you; he *is* sick.
t1_dunoqed	0	*	Doesnt look much like youre denying it either.
t1_dup6uqh	1	*	You know that real Russian people exist too right?
t1_dunnk3m	0	*	He did give you evidence.   Go watch CNN, now go watch Fox.   Now wonder whether they are reporting from the same dimension.  
t1_duoyddx	1	*	the 1980s called and they want their foreign policy back
t1_duo9wui	1	*	Dont be that guy, nobody likes that guy.
t1_dunz8w9	0	*	I am sure he has lied on occasion, but not more than any typical human being.
t1_duo06dz	1	*	Granted.   Can you imagine a scenario where someone might not behave as you say? Im hesitant to expect that people will always engage in thoughtful introspection whenever their views are challenged.
t1_dunwdk2	1	*	Yeah, and several decades ago Democrats and Republicans had the completely opposite views they do today.
t1_dsgad23	0	*	Please quote where I said said it was 3.5% PER year, Ill wait.  Again, you seem a China troll.  
t1_dtt8ghk	0	*	What about China what about Saudi, whataboutism isnt an argument. 
t1_dt31v4q	1	*	Null and void?  Is there a contract?  What legality isnt calid?
t1_dt37sig	0	*	No it wouldn't be interesting.  As an atheist I don't care how people are differently wrong.
t1_dt3jg0h	1	*	This from someone who read a conspiracy theory and complained that revelation was spelled wrong. I'm hurt.
t1_dt3y8wl	0	*	Let me see the entire region was owned by the natives you know the palestinians.   Now tell me why do u defend a nation violating international law. 
t1_dtueslg	0	*	If you had the money to spend to receive better medicine and shorter waiting time, you honestly would forgo it all in the name of equal and fair quality of care?
t1_dttbh02	0	*	How would you prefer to pay for the equipment and upkeep of the $300k ambulance? 
t1_dtth8lw	0	*	Cuba? 
t1_dttf6rl	0	*	Public school teacher here.  Yes this is true.  We stopped saying the Pledge a long time ago actually, but it was resurrected after 9-11 coinciding with the death of many freedoms.
t1_dttekws	1	*	Timing is everything. That was during the greatest recession in living memory. 
t1_dttgr1f	0	*	I normally buy store brand but I can't lie I didn't know Asda made their own noodles. They can't be much higher, I'll report back. Thanks for the tip!
t1_dttjsbt	1	*	Can't afford to sue haha
t1_dtuwb67	1	*	Why are you yelling at Brian?!
t1_dttgv9k	1	*	It really is to be honest. 
t1_dtu0tpl	1	*	I know. The eye roll that induced. 
t1_dtu8qea	1	*	Try xa30k out of pocket max in non third-world countries!
t1_dttbbxb	0	*	Seeing your PCP costs less than an ER visit.  Preventative medicine is growing to help combat this.  I can't stress it enough, there needs to be education surrounding this.
t1_dttc4s7	1	*	You don't pay to see specialists in Australia.  Only at private practices and it isn't heaps there either, plus a lot of the time you get half back if you do pay.
t1_dtvt5lj	0	*	I thought your country spent more on welfare?? Trying too hard mate.
t1_dtu0lr9	0	*	Cash me outside!
t1_dtuork9	0	*	Are you supporting the system that can potentially ruin you financially for the rest of your life? (Or cut it very short if you can't afford it and don't go to a doctor)
t1_dttjmg2	1	*	Doesn't mean some of them won't try. I got sent to the principal's office all the time in school for not saying it.
t1_dttb6bl	0	*	My federal taxes were 5.4% of my income. How's that on your Danish heart? 
t1_dtti12l	0	*	Has this practice ever been questioned on a larger scale? It is kinda weird when you think about it.
t1_dtv0b7j	1	*	How was he misdiagnosed? 
t1_dtuaqj4	0	*	Only a fool will compare veteran health care to universal health Care.  
t1_dv7ib0s	0	*	I'm pretty sure that's not true. 
t1_dttmoe1	0	*	When you make a definitive sweeping statement where you declare something is ZERO, anything that proves it more than zero proves the statement is false.
t1_dttrup0	0	*	Do you know how many Americans don't have 5k?
t1_dttdvid	1	*	Perfect president then...  ^^^^/^^^^s
t1_dtwzndy	1	*	Let's hug it out
t1_dtu1n62	0	*	May be you feel lucky to be American, I feel *blessed* not to be one.  And the land of opportunity? That's nothing but an empty catchphrase. What does it even mean? 
t1_dttmnzf	1	*	The laymen parrot it a great deal.  You know he's mostly talking about the conservative element, right, and not the more moderate/progressive parts of the public?
t1_dtuit8l	0	*	It just sounds like your complaints on the US medical system are just more errors made by you rather than the doctor.
t1_dttbz6b	0	*	In the primaries, 80% of young people supported Sanders. More young people supported Sanders than Trump and Hillary combined.   The pendulum is swinging back hard, the question is when. 
t1_dtu2w9j	1	*	Who supports the warlords? 
t1_dttdfoj	0	*	> Taxes are a fact of life  Sure, but that doesn't mean holding a gun to someone's head is ethical. I don't believe any situation morally justifies it.    
t1_dtvd0vj	1	*	I pay $2000 a month for one. In other industrialized countries, it's subsidized by the govt, as is preschool.  
t1_dtthrec	1	*	Homeopathy was an example and youre right. Overly expensive treatment is not offered when less expensive treatment has the same proven results.
t1_dttc9td	0	*	In the UK?  Yes, it can.  Otherwise why would there be doctors who specialize in one form of treatment or disease and yet not be apart of NHS?  
t1_dtto3fj	0	*	Well, let me know.  Until then, it's prudent to assume that wages rise when businesses have to compete for labor, and stagnate when many people are willing to work for less. 
t1_dtwh127	0	*	Higher chance of dying than winning the lotto. A negative lotto in itself.
t1_dttitn2	1	*	Gilded in my heart
t1_dttnoia	0	*	Okay mate.   At the end of the day it's just your own country you're shitting up. No skin off my nose. 
t1_dttd7nb	0	*	Wow, I'm now a millionaire! 
t1_dttkkbu	0	*	Do you guys really get circumcised? Like most of you?
t1_dttd1ss	0	*	> I know it's hard for you to understand, but a coherent worldview actually requires knowledge and effort.  Something...something...something...pretentious Europeans...
t1_dtu0mtm	0	*	Within the parameters of this specific convo the analogy fits fine. Lol
t1_dttqh74	0	*	Get it all, chief. 
t1_dttfbpv	1	*	Good job guys, we closed the loop.
t1_dttkqnz	0	*	Except corporations arent absolute monarchies, and dont have absolute power. 
t1_dtw1wlz	0	*	Wow! This is very interesting! My friend is actually having her first baby today then back to work next week :/
t1_dttbkvs	1	*	Which is why I've been saying that there needs to be education about what to go in for.  Most UC/IC in major cities are open until 9 pm.  
t1_dtty59q	0	*	Oh yeah, for sure, I agree with that. It sucks. If America as a whole just paid into a big, national pot and paid healthcare costs out of that, it'd be a lot easier for all of us.
t1_dttd45g	0	*	> Besides, I tried to go to one once, it was 6pm and they were closed.  I fail to see how giving you free healthcare would solve this problem.
t1_dttcpz8	1	*	It's unbelievable. Ambulance charging like a taxi.
t1_dtu89ki	1	*	Mandatory participation is a terrible argument that holds no water.  It's like saying we can't force police, fire, utilities, roads, K-12 education, courts, etc. to work.  It's ludicrous.
t1_dtuodwp	0	*	So the people who don't qualify as lower middle class but they don't meet the absolute bottom line of poverty, near homelessness, the area inbetween, aren't considered poor. Solid logic.
t1_dttejkj	0	*	We all hope you are right. 
t1_dttbuaw	0	*	Oh go do your job.
t1_dtujzpm	0	*	Is there something wrong with their argument? Their data? Is it not a reputable organization? I see your concern, but unless you can point to some substantive issues, I can't agree with it.
t1_dtvkqw9	1	*	And health care was affordable, even if you paid out of pocket.
t1_dttlrhp	1	*	LOL potato guy. thanks high school German.
t1_du1h9gl	0	*	So you think that what matters is there being an actual physical flag?
t1_dttv5vk	1	*	I just called it soccer to differentiate between you calling it 'football' haha 
t1_dttbhp6	1	*	Don't blame him/her. Blame the system.
t1_dttve6x	0	*	I already do, the usa has a progressive tax system. 50% of the usa pays 0 income tax.  I ask again, if soneone elects to not buy insurance knowing the risks, should I  have to pay for them?
t1_dtthxva	0	*	Isn't it ironic
t1_dttdhon	0	*	How do you think the state enforces laws? Do you think they just ask kindly if you disobey them?
t1_dttkit9	0	*	And yet, somehow, the rest of the civilized world manages to make universal healthcare work and it's citizens wouldn't trade what they have for our system any day of the week. Imagine that. 
t1_dttk0gd	1	*	They can sue if they have the resources to do it (ie, time and money to pursue that, and enough education to know how to do so correctly).
t1_dttg124	0	*	Idk, retiring early after working the hours that doctors work is not healthy, I would prefere to earn less and live a better lifestyle, even if I had to retire later.
t1_dttvmr9	1	*	Dude, he nailed you with solid math.  You were just spouting lazy platitudes and he nailed you.
t1_dttbvov	0	*	I showed two.
t1_dttvchc	1	*	You don't actually think Medicaid is a functional solution, do you? Have you ever actually seen what it's like to try and use it?
t1_dttcd7j	0	*	Except the vast majority have insurance and aren't screwed.  Yet you threw individuals with a rare disease under the bus.  Kudos.
t1_dttffji	0	*	People's generosity is amazing, **You** are amazing. Thank you very much.
t1_dtv9lmi	1	*	I did not hear of that. Funny that their conspiracy has them shifting to the easier option to fake/change.... 
t1_dttdn53	1	*	ily
t1_dtu1mgh	1	*	Yeah it's kind of semantics depending on what the guy you where talking too thinks patriotism is.  I like your description though, everyone should view their country like that.
t1_dttwpzw	0	*	Lmao. I accrued a lot of medical dept when I was younger and I wasn't fucked for the rest of my life.
t1_dttuwhi	0	*	What? We have social security in the US. 
t1_dttigtk	0	*	So we even offered shit with no proven medical benefit?! What do these people fucking want?!
t1_dttps27	1	*	No I'm not the one who hates black people. That would be the group constantly telling them they can't be successful without white people's handouts.
t1_dttckk6	0	*	Why not?
t1_dttzbop	1	*	That's literally a distraction from the real issues.
t1_dtu7kx7	0	*	It was implied people of color cant afford/dont have IDs. 
t1_dttk5oy	1	*	It's almost as if people too poor to afford healthcare don't have money to travel or vacation either? Weird. 
t1_dttoooc	1	*	Yup. A couple years ago we were making 36k for a family of 5. I would have had to owe 5k in medical bills before they would cover me (& not for the 5k, just any bills above that).
t1_dttdvxv	0	*	Cant view that community, but based on the name I assume its to do with Democrat Party? 
t1_dttcvvr	0	*	What a fucking false equivalence. Equating aging to spending money. Do you ever question why someone like me disagrees with you?
t1_dtty3xc	1	*	hehe  cum
t1_dttij8x	1	*	Except half of those freedoms are taken the moment you step into a school or other public place, or if your talking to a cop.
t1_duqo6g4	0	*	I am guessing by your response that you did not read quora article on Usain Bolt (and others)
t1_dup0ydg	0	*	Paul Manafort could walk around downtown Sydney and 99% of the people wouldnt recognise him.
t1_duor95r	0	*	> but try to think of why would someone not watch mainstream news.  Someone who hasn't actually watched mainstream news?  SOMEONE TOLD THEM WHAT TO DO.  Did I get it right?
t1_dur9beo	0	*	>Nicolas Cage*  FTFY 
t1_duoryza	0	*	Rod Rosenstein appointed him. Trump wasn't involved.
t1_duoxb98	0	*	Requesting decency is not the same as being indecent.  
t1_dupv2nt	1	*	Literally yes, that's what cops do.
t1_duqvavl	1	*	I've actually been to Miami Beach and liked it. Wyoming is desolate. That state needs life.
t1_dup4qmo	0	*	The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.  - Edmund Burke  
t1_du37min	0	*	So where have they applied?
t1_du4khm3	1	*	How much have they risen vs previous periods?  Its like everywhere and anyone, you live withblessor means until you can afford a nicer house and whatever else you want
t1_dtdkk3n	0	*	The terrorists, yes.  But you didnt answer my question. What is it called when Israel does it, purposefully killing civilians?
t1_dtexq0p	0	*	The north/South of the pole represent Authoritarian governments and the South represents libertarian government.  The comment itself was poorly written, but the fucks I give at this point don't exist.
t1_dtdvevl	0	*	Doesn't contribute to the discussion.  Unless you inherently find investing corrupt, it isn't hard to become at least a millionaire in the US through good saving and investing habits.
t1_dtfyk9x	0	*	Yes yes I know that. I was telling the  other person above that the second amendment was phrased the way it was specifically due to slavery.
t1_dtdvz1p	0	*	I heard he also likes to kick puppies.
t1_dtdwfkg	0	*	There are plenty of wealthy people in the U.S. who did it honestly. Undoubtedly there are plenty who are corrupt, but not every rich person is corrupt. 
t1_dtdytch	1	*	Fox News world lol
t1_dtdzeen	1	*	He filed the paperwork and won a couple states. Whether it was a political hit job or not, he was formally in the race in every sense that matters legally.
t1_dtdyn4o	1	*	Care to make an argument?
t1_dte6q18	1	*	The link was the relevant part
t1_dtdxizz	1	*	They seem to all live in a fantasy world in their heads where Donald Trump is, like, really smart. 
t1_dtebohr	1	*	The horrible truth is than there's not a single person in all these protests worth being erased. They've all been made harmless and worthless long ago.
t1_dtf0uq6	1	*	Also being incredibly rich helps...
t1_dtdxnd4	0	*	Entitled purity politics are clearly garbage, incidentally, if for no other reason they're why we have an objectively worse candidate in power than we might have done. 
t1_dtegxmk	0	*	That would mean having some reading comprehension and basic undersranding.
t1_dtedhlh	1	*	Sounds like a pretty low bar. And one that doesn't make a lot of sense, seeing as Venezuela was, for the most part, run by the wealthy.
t1_dte5abi	1	*	Yes, they are in much worse shape than they were in 1991, the people I mean.
t1_dtdvd8b	0	*	Trump literally said in the campaign that he didn't even get drain the swamp but people liked so he kept it up lol  Cmon
t1_dte0r0d	1	*	I mean I am all over the no killing, no raping, no stealing thing. I like those becoming laws.
t1_dtdz5dy	1	*	Lol, k lad. 
t1_dte7eat	0	*	Oops, thought you were the same person as the previous comment. And wasn't it two years ago?
t1_dte6sax	1	*	Don't know wtf you're talking about. I was at dinner with the family. Got back to checking replies. Why so douchey?
t1_dtg09nf	0	*	That's why you have to not be retarded. You know, when assassinating world leaders you sort of want that to be rule #1
t1_dtdv30d	1	*	What? If you don't think that's possible, you're just bitter.
t1_dte3byx	0	*	It's very easy to have a vast majority when you're the only option.
t1_dtdzx3h	1	*	Starting from the top and staying there doesn't make you a success. 
t1_dti0g5w	0	*	Uh just so you know I'm pro second amendment. I support arming the population.
t1_dte10b8	1	*	Uh what? It is definitely possible. 
t1_dtg5hqf	1	*	It's like a planet full of man-children that makes you ask Who raised that asshole?.
t1_dte6p2h	1	*	I know. It wasn't meant for you. You should see all of the other responses lol.
t1_dsu88ay	0	*	Really?  So if someone who steals to feed their family, they're exactly as bad as someone who steals for greed? 
t1_dunu2m6	1	*	Agreed. I'm starting to hear the sound of tinfoil banjos.
t1_dunpn8e	0	*	Because I want to give it to black people and mexicans.
t1_dt4kgm3	0	*	Like what?
t1_dt66d0c	0	*	There's not much to figure out.
t1_dsuvh6d	1	*	Asinine 
t1_dsul6oa	1	*	Eh, he deserves it if he tried to kill someone.
t1_dsxf4ao	1	*	How long has the conflict been going on in your opinion? When did it start? Do you count buses more than trains and cafes and markets? Why? 
t1_dsvwerz	1	*	However... none of that matters as international rules apply. No settlements... And the consequences are on Israel's hands. You can't say... Better not attack me or esse I will break all laws...
t1_dsuwcse	0	*	You need to learn some fucking history 
t1_dv08aqi	0	*	Whats funny is how passionate you are to kill them. Every one of your comments was slammed down
t1_dv059uh	0	*	>Yes, I'd attack. I'm American.  Quick question... If South Korea, who has a vote in this, decides not to allow US force flow how exactly is the US going to attack? 
t1_dv0g6yz	1	*	Just scroll through it to the pictures if you don't want to read it
t1_duhkkpx	1	*	Well if your standard of living is so good, I assume you never need to improve anything right? Argentina must have zero issues worth criticising.
t1_ds9t8tb	0	*	Remember that time a hashtag effectively ended the careers of multiple Hollywood big shots by giving a larger platform to victims of sexual assault? Nah, me neither.
t1_dsa81lz	0	*	Didn't say you'd have a problem. If you didn't want your ravings to be public, you wouldn't have posted it.
t1_ds9m85f	0	*	> Hundreds of civilians died in each car bombing  I'm guess I'm not familiar with this
t1_ds9gs98	0	*	If Iran was backing it wasn't random.  There was someone there they were targeting.  
t1_ds9ejii	1	*	It was the ayatollahs that sent innumerable unarmed people and children to die in hopeless attacks
t1_ds9efk8	0	*	Saddam is irrelevant  The ayatollahs didn't give a shit about Iranians lives
t1_dsa5k99	0	*	No. It's exactly what /u/Outsidethelimits meant when he said You go free Tibet while I order a latte. Bumper sticker slacktivism isn't doing anything besides virtue signalling.
t1_ds9idt2	1	*	You wanna roll around in the semantic mud, you go for it... 
t1_ds9m51m	0	*	Wow, detailed rebuttal.
t1_dsezn0y	1	*	condemning the stabbing of innocent people as much as someone building houses..... I think you prove my point. 
t1_ds9gmiv	0	*	No. Iran is intent on wiping Israel off the map with heavy duty erasers while making sure not a single Jew is hurt in the process. Do you have the slightest grasp of implied meaning?
t1_dsbmiis	0	*	What makes you think a world with four (and a half) powers will be peaceful? Like I said, we've been here before. 
t1_ds9mnv3	1	*	I have. It's fiction. 
t1_ds9gfra	0	*	You really think they'd use their limited resources to reach around the world to kill some random Argentine Jews?  Like they just threw darts at a map and were like Argentina it is!
t1_ds9lazq	0	*	Im not in charge.  Just pointing it out.  Not claiming its fair or right, but those countries won land by conquest.  Used to be the way.  Still is if you count Russian incursions.
t1_duitk60	0	*	You calling everyone who voted for brexit far right is derisory.
t1_duig6bn	1	*	Have you guys formed a support group yet?
t1_dv0r2fb	1	*	How am I making fun of anything? The US navy has gotten into numerous accidents with Japanese vessels
t1_dsznix6	1	*	In.the context of an illegal sale, jesus. Reading comprehension dude, figure it out. 
t1_duru2rn	0	*	Meh, at least I've got your stupidity immortalized.  https://imgur.com/a/ICkGj
t1_dupsn25	0	*	Ok. I agree that painting your group as a victim can help deflect criticism. Let me ask you this: were approximately 6 million Jews killed in Nazi Germany during WW2 as a result of Nazi policy?
t1_duqgtdz	0	*	Go ahead and draw him.  
t1_dtbmob4	0	*	Imagine the kind of guy that would write that with sincerity, the top minds on show.

t1_ds2npq0	0	*	you keep playing on words and you know you are dishonest but tries to push it anyway for self convincing. i have no time for that, ignorelist
t1_ds2onpy	0	*	It doesnt, but the comment above implied that theres a connection between socialism and anti-vax, which is not true.
t1_dsx3pf6	0	*	You can either believe people have religious experiences or think they are delusional. 
t1_dsxbzlu	0	*	I'm fairly certain most people don't have the money required to do experiments that let them observe electrons, much less do anything that could potentially prove the big bang theory.
t1_dsabmhi	0	*	Uh, so are all we talking about human meat here or?
t1_dsek3ks	0	*	The guy they interviewed on the news had been here for 17 years and couldn't even speak English. I'm not sure he knew much of anything.
t1_dse0e2j	1	*	Not the same thing at all. Buying souveniers is lightyears from just sending your paycheck.
t1_dsfdgnh	1	*	Nah I'm going to sit behind the keyboard and do nothing like my man Iskandermissile. 
t1_dsdt7qf	0	*	Why kick out legal citizens?
t1_dse4zic	1	*	We should get rid of that too.
t1_dsea42j	0	*	Look! Up in the air! Its the point! Oh, you just missed it.  Theres a big difference between buying something made in a foreign country, and literally sending your paycheck to them.
t1_dseh2jo	1	*	Like they have 18 months before being kicked out?.. 
t1_dsekm6g	1	*	Okay how about they are staying in your spare bed room at your house and you die and someone inherits your house and evicts them.
t1_dsegraz	0	*	No its actually just stupid trend that will eventually die. 
t1_dsdyv2k	1	*	And what our country wants to do with its immigrations is none of anyone else's concern. Tit-for-tat.
t1_dse4xnq	0	*	Tax revenue would be higher if it was a citizen doing that job.
t1_dseu5a6	1	*	> ablest  KEK  > Actually, no, I'm not doing this. You're too far up your own ass to ever consider facts over emotions.  Double KEK
t1_dsdt0eo	0	*	Because when they pop out a kid, they are eligible for welfare on that child. Then if you try to deport them,  people like you get hysterical that we follow our laws.
t1_dumvb74	0	*	If it's paranoid to think that people are trying to kill people with guns, then why are you concerned about there being future shootings?
t1_dusxgw0	0	*	So if I were to steal from you in the name of Christianity, you believe it would be reasonable to blame Christianity for my actions?   
t1_du3rkjb	0	*	The reproductive rate is such that the species will tend to survive. (outside Louisiana that is)
t1_dt6q4kv	0	*	>they are interchangeable  No, no they're not.  A liberal is someone who supports capitalism, whereas leftists are opposed to capitalism.  
t1_dt6givp	1	*	you're so saddddddd ahhahaha
t1_dt6tz26	1	*	Good luck. Just remember that it's not your responsibility to change their mind. Never feel like it is.
t1_dt8g0g9	0	*	There's been good kings and bad kings. Got that. But what about monarchy as a whole? It's shit.
t1_dt6c69e	0	*	Cool cool cool. Just to be clear, you dont have a problem with me socking people flying literal swastikas, right?
t1_dt6w2b4	1	*	Which is why I support democratic governance with multiple layers of checks and balances and why I want to work towards a post-scarcity society. 
t1_dt6ezat	1	*	>This is when I stopped reading your post  Good to know, carry on in bliss then.
t1_dt6o8it	0	*	Could you repeat that so I understand the second half? I'm serious, I think you mistyped something.
t1_dt6oy5f	0	*	the comment was for the peanut gallery.
t1_dt7eoux	0	*	Your public library will provide you with a free access to internet. What is the next scapegoat we'll blame for not being successful?
t1_dt6xvar	0	*	Online domains are dirt cheap though. If you can't afford a basic, spartan domain how are you going to afford producing anything of value?
t1_dt6navt	0	*	Albania isn't a muslim country.
t1_dt6kj6y	1	*	And everyone knows Albania is a paragon of safety and religious freedom. 
t1_dt6c8dq	1	*	All neo nazis are fascists, not all fascists are neo nazis. All get punched 
t1_dt6fuva	0	*	Oh shit, man. Glad I know the law now.
t1_dt6q964	0	*	Language changes. If you look in the dictionary literally now also means figuratively. Its the nature of the beast.
t1_dt6ucnh	0	*	What? The means of production are easily defined, you seize it from the bourgeiose and if the bourgeiose want it back, stop them... Simples.
t1_dt68u3l	0	*	You are free to not agree, that's the beauty of the world 
t1_dt6a0zt	0	*	Yes, me being aware of what is written in the Koran and the Hadiths is why there is violence.  I don't respect violent and regressive beliefs and cultures.
t1_dt68xrm	1	*	I recommend you pick up a translation and read it sometime. At the very least it will give you insight. Also translation differ depending on the author due to the Quran being in Arabic. 
t1_dumeyix	0	*	nah you're one of those guys who think everything israel does is wrong. you're not worth my time.
t1_dun7y3i	0	*	well, nothing of what you said changes the fact that Israel is oppressing Palestinians since many years, sorry
t1_dsgk0kx	1	*	Oh, I thought you were seeking discussion. My bad.
t1_dsggnmc	1	*	I was trying to square his assertion with my model of reality. If you don't want to help me, that's fine :)
t1_dull0k1	0	*	Heck, even during this, if India were holding em to random, they wouldn't have done all they did in the aftermath of the 2015 earthquake in Kathmandu
t1_dum39y1	1	*	well... that's just like... Your opinion dude! 
t1_dulognf	1	*	it's obviously you have a wildly different definition of sinister. would you say the positioning of the US Air Craft carrier in Indian waters to be a sinister action?
t1_dumlgmr	1	*	Yes but one of the two is caused by the existence of the other
t1_dulcvvw	1	*	Totally.
t1_ds62p5l	0	*	>Bush was well liked  That just makes me sad (because it might be true). As much as I hate Trump for being a bofoon, Bush was actually a war criminal. Remember the WMDs in Iraq?
t1_dsggg1v	1	*	And I don't give a shit what you are or what you think. GFYS 
t1_du1u8uf	1	*	Oh that makes sense then
t1_du1eth5	0	*	Yeah, my sentiments exactly. The passiveness is what helps me keep abreast of whats going on amongst my family/friends at a time thats convenient for me. Seems like a win/win.
t1_duirqmt	0	*	Criticising a country with 6 ongoing failed wars, millions of civilians killed and a funder of terrorism is bad? damn what a shame i see the world objectively.  
t1_duxt6a7	1	*	I don't think u/pongpongisking was attacking you. I think they were trying to compliment your country saying how we can always count on you guys.
t1_duj9af2	1	*	Not all. Never said so. You're attacking the straw man. 
t1_dt96zoo	1	*	Asspain? Does it speak English? Did u no that bleach is gud 4 wait loss? U shud drnk bleach. It will make u smartr.
t1_dt82rnz	1	*	What did they say about slavery?
t1_dv0sirb	0	*	They choose to be terrorists, they arent made
t1_dv0rcmd	1	*	Well then what should happen?  Let them keep stabbing innocent people?  Shooting people at concerts?  Blowing up skyscrapers?
t1_du0nzgm	0	*	The common denominator is you, though.
t1_du5les8	0	*	We don't use Craigslist in NZ. Those will be scams. Look at traderme.co.nz  Any rent you see in NZ will be the weekly amount.
t1_duxy27x	1	*	Oh yeah thats how I remember him
t1_duz1346	1	*	I saw him at the Spearmint Rhino (strip club in LA), huge bag of weed in hand, grinning like a schoolgirl as he walked into the VIP section, back around 2005. XD
t1_duxo3iy	0	*	Serious question. Is that much stupidity painful? 
t1_duxrwcy	1	*	LOL     Nazi Punks Fuck Off plays quietly in the background
t1_duxoetn	0	*	Actually, Jello Biafra was very active fighting for civil rights the last 40 years. Bad example to pick bud. 
t1_duxqf38	1	*	I don't think you follow Jello Biafra very well or somehow you've concluded that civil rights have nothing to do with human rights.
t1_duxnxqq	0	*	I don't believe in fairy tales, particularly when a politically motivated new edition rewrites the older.
t1_duzeivk	0	*	And here we see an example of a (poor) attempt at gaslighting.

t1_dv0req8	0	*	Oh... I was just making a joke about OwO.  But thank you for being helpful.
t1_dv30b7s	1	*	What % of the U.S. population do you think understand the nuances of this vs. MSM, Facebook, etc? 
t1_duz0uli	1	*	Your recap serves what purpose exactly? 
t1_duxyxsp	1	*	That's a totally different 'punk' entirely, four decades late.
t1_duy66y2	1	*	Loool
t1_duxzhar	1	*	Yes.  Keep it up!

t1_dv07qbe	0	*	https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assault_weapon  Its a term that has no definition. It might aswell not exist. 
t1_duy1t47	1	*	Americans couldnt understand cheeky lad culture. Converted it to their Le badass ironic culture.  Killed it.
t1_duxxuw1	0	*	Starting a war is a crime now. where in federal law is that 
t1_duy4j2a	1	*	He has a YouTube and did a vid with Ethan from h3h3, he seemed genuine and funny. 
t1_duy1967	1	*	That sounds like a good time! He probably has more stories then he could remember over several lifetimes...
t1_duy5dk3	0	*	I know what you mean, I couldn't help but smile thinking of the two of them on set together. If only Steve-O could act. Wildboyz+Knoxville was always my favorite Jackass offshoot.
t1_duyiqep	1	*	Probably not considering I'm something like twice your age bub.

t1_dv0b3p6	0	*	U0001f602U0001f602U0001f602   It has given me a solid chuckle to see you so disparaged. Lmfao. Rarely do I run into someone so insecure. What a treat.
t1_duug6xm	0	*	They would be arrested because its illegal. 
t1_duuuklt	0	*	I've read before that 969 has spread over there and Cambodia. They are like a smaller scale ISIS.
t1_duvomek	1	*	Im not cynical about all the people or the whole world. Im just cynical about the state of my country and people in it who support the junta propaganda. 
t1_dtxxbdp	1	*	yeah, but somethin big happened at the end of WWII that kind of changed warfare. 
t1_dtipu32	0	*	Bilateral-conflicts kind of politics.. i implied it before. Okay?, now stfu
t1_dtwnjut	0	*	This doesnt mean she would have started a war. 
t1_dsnbx7z	0	*	Maybe, but the primary goal has to be attempting to destroy the others launch ability.  Other wise they will destroy your launch ability, then attack whatever at thier l;esiure
t1_dsn3hjz	0	*	which is why i doubt they would ever fire it at Hawaii.   
t1_dsnawgc	1	*	I don't know why you're asking me, pal. 
t1_dsnbico	1	*	I was referencing Stargate SG1. Its a fantastic sci fi show. Give it a try if you haven't. Their main base is under NORAD 
t1_dsn8lq9	1	*	I watched it a long time ago.  Will have to watch again soon.
t1_dsnbxy0	0	*	Think of them as ablative armour. 
t1_dsnc3qr	1	*	Hell the British don't even bother with land missile sites. Their nuclear weapons program is entirely done with subs
t1_dsnn3v1	1	*	The Mad Men episodes surrounding the Cold War were very eerie, especially taking place in Manhattan which you just assume is target #1 at all times.
t1_dsnc0j0	1	*	Spoilers, you are living through it
t1_dsnl8f8	0	*	I think so.  That is, unless someone has prerecorded an EAM and replayed it.  I think a radio show did that a few years ago, not realizing what they were doing.
t1_dsn4x8j	0	*	Know where those subs are?  Know if we have subs outfitted with anti missile tech?  Didn't think so
t1_dsnajul	1	*	they made a nuke, they made a reliable delivery system  no one is invading them  whether the us comes around or not, the south will negotiate a peace.
t1_dsnernf	1	*	I replied on one of the other threads within this parent thread. It's nothing classified, but it should ease some folks minds.
t1_dso3d99	0	*	redacted
t1_dsn7273	1	*	The old 'ballistic missiles work by going up and letting the planet spin under them' view is erroneous.
t1_dsnn8k8	1	*	More birds die from house cats than windmills each year... should be ban house cats while were at it?
t1_dsn55di	1	*	Because it's our duty. 
t1_dsnhd17	1	*	The question about How did they get those targets within a margin of error of 5 meters with those ballistic missiles is something I never had a clue about the answer
t1_dsn2bcf	0	*	The planet spins the other direction, bro
t1_dsncx2k	1	*	Fair enough, though hopefully in the future, at the bare minimum, they don't include the THIS IS NOT A DRILL part in drills.
t1_dsn6xme	1	*	Maybe that's a separate button?
t1_dsndl9q	1	*	He probably just means he makes online ads using them as pictures. Nothing to see here.
t1_dsnpd6w	1	*	Ignoring the alarms and just carrying on? I've gone from being 100% certain that you're British to about 132%
t1_dsnfh6h	1	*	Oh, sure. And there might be something nefarious. Probably is, but I really cant rule out gross negligence, incompetence, and poor communication. Especially from government and military personnel.
t1_dsnanhe	0	*	I was looking into tyvek coveralls,  sadly most i saw come in white.  Tyvek also folds nicely. 
t1_dsn6e4l	1	*	Explicitly mentioning this is not a drill should not be an option for testing.
t1_dsnilzv	1	*	If a passenger plane is flying within 1,500 feet of one of those high powered transmitters, you've got bigger problems than microwaving people.  
t1_dsnl3dn	1	*	he was playing golf anyway
t1_dsn5szh	1	*	Lol. Twitler. Thats a first for me. I love it. 
t1_dsn3crg	1	*	He's super high up dude, knows all the deets
t1_dsnxmdz	1	*	Dammed if I know! It's actually one big gripe people have with this game. Guess ghouls don't need to do all that?
t1_dsn2x9y	1	*	Planet takes longer than 40 minutes to spin between NK and NY.

t1_dsn3941	0	*	Well its not like he works on those systems specifically. And even if he did so what? Theres books on radar guided SAM interception in my university.
t1_dsnh7vz	1	*	so fuckin ClipIt is in charge of our nuclear attack warning systems  God fuckin dammit
t1_dsnjb65	1	*	I mean, the more I wrote the more sense it made, honestly.
t1_dsn8k5b	1	*	Oh man,  it's been forever since i have seen that movie.  I think it's time to watch it again. 
t1_dsmyajn	0	*	Someone did notify the stable genius, I saw an article about it. He was golfing.
t1_dsn98kj	0	*	Are you saying that nukes explode at a higher altitude than a fighter jet can go?
t1_dsn84ii	1	*	That's the spirit man. Ride and die, in that case. I would get quite lit if I was right in the fallout zone. Find some good drugs and pray I become a ghoul B)  Really though, that Tear Bomba. Fuck. 
t1_dsn3wxh	1	*	If you can get a missile moving directly on a head-on collision course with an incoming ICBM, it should be able to hit it. The hard part is getting a missile in such a precise position in time. 
t1_dsnavjc	0	*	But our bunkers arent.
t1_dsndvkn	1	*	Yet
t1_dsn3xki	1	*	I have If missile launch, color cycle living room lights set up.
t1_dsn8x2l	1	*	The nukes are all still there. People just don't talk about it as much.
t1_dsogmeh	1	*	....well damn, I stand corrected.
t1_dsmupcj	0	*	we've sen this in the fallout games. The nukes hit, the US launches it's nukes, and the world falls into anarchy, death, chaos and deathclaws 
t1_dsnh8t7	1	*	There is one, it just doesn't work very well.
t1_dsn5qdt	1	*	Somebody needs to check what WOPR is doing.
t1_dsnj8b3	0	*	The most important finance building in the country having a plane flown into it seems like a pretty big deal. How would this require hindsight for anyone but a complete idiot?
t1_dsnkecy	1	*	It is single-use though...
t1_dsoute9	1	*	Will it block dust? Is contaminated dust the main source of radioactive fallout when slightly away from the incident? Then it limits the amount of radiation I Breage into my body.
t1_dsn3g4u	1	*	It's literally public information. 
t1_dsnbop4	0	*	I think they're joking and making a reference to a movie 
t1_dss7c19	0	*	This is interesting.  I'm no expert, just citing the sources I've linked.  They claim based on seismological data that the underground test on Sept. 3rd was closer to that upper range, 100kt to 250kt.
t1_dsn6yl9	1	*	Hubris. 
t1_duia6rk	0	*	So, just random people pulling numbers out of their ass.
t1_duimos1	0	*	wow you must be some kind of genius, please share more of your knowledge with the world.
t1_dv4hv3b	1	*	That article didnt even really source anything.  I looked around the whole thing to find the sources and couldnt. It seems like more an opinion piece masquerading as good journalism.
t1_dthvtq6	1	*	That's definitely what I said.
t1_dthbtue	1	*	Exactly, it depends on the person, so you can't say it is better if it isn't here to chose, or if it isn't even a person yet.
t1_dtgujnq	1	*	Oh cool, I had no idea. It's good to keep in mind that even when things go wrong, there's always something to be learned from it. 
t1_dsc99nc	0	*	Because I don't espouse your viewpoint?  Demanding a woman think the same as you strikes me as rather sexist.
t1_duwn0yn	1	*	Sure.  Doesn't mean we don't talk about the should.  Caring more for whales instead of pigs or cows is incredibly stupid.
t1_duupwaf	0	*	If they are smart theyd hide inland
t1_duuldyh	1	*	What a touching concern for the will of the people. They should get to choose what their country does, unless you don't like it. Then they should let other people choose until you like the result.
t1_duuubz0	0	*	Or are we comparing bloodlines?
t1_duupcmm	0	*	I know we saw what happened to Clarkson and friends. But I'm guessing that was your version of chavs and not the average argie. 
t1_duueqkk	0	*	So, you've got nothing.
t1_duurcwr	0	*	> im not saying that though...  To be fair, there were 1 or 2 excursions into the modern german saxon region  > I'm done with you being willfully ignorant  Bye.    
t1_duur544	0	*	Buddy is clearly on the payroll of the RoC
t1_duurl5a	1	*	His/her grammar is fucking horrible in the first place. 
t1_duutf5g	0	*	Yeah or its a straw man that the dems are using to cover their asses
t1_duuebff	0	*	But it's ok if the biggest does it because lol Europe.  I'll be sure to damn Europe when China is busy stripping the Pacific bare.
t1_duuz34f	1	*	I was addressing the issue of current political dissent in America, so deflecting to examples decades old in other countries isn't relevant. 
t1_duv4oz2	0	*	Yeah there is built-in racism in the prison industry 
t1_duujmxv	1	*	I was pointing out where you said taking interest in a country not becoming a dictatorship and exemplifying the difference.
t1_duuugvf	1	*	Sometimes I need reminding that caricatures stem from reality.
t1_duurgpp	1	*	Which is ironic, as his diction and spelling isn't the best.
t1_duuqgk7	0	*	But hes not a king. He still will have to get re-elected by their electoral system. He's just allowed to serve more terms. You know a US president served more than two terms in our history? 
t1_duuktx4	1	*	Ah, I thought the question was regarding the nuclear carriers rather than the mines.  Drinking and reading comprehension dont always go together, it seems.
t1_duuktxc	1	*	I think he/she is simply pointing out that whaling may not be as cruel as other current forms of animal harvesting and aptly used the pig as an example.
t1_duux0ox	0	*	Tienamen square.   Now go sit back down. 
t1_duuonql	0	*	Your comment is very reasonable and I agree with you. I only brought up the example to help remind people that China is not innocent and US transgressions shouldnt be used to excuse their behavior.
t1_duupnaw	0	*	You're either a troll, or someone who's had a poor, POOR education.  Please watch any wildlife documentary or retake some biology classes, farms can't replace the earth.  
t1_duuqgdl	1	*	It's not your fault.  I'm the one that sees an instant reply and thinks it is live...
t1_duv2omi	1	*	which is not a dictatorship by definition

t1_duvdghl	0	*	By foreign actors?
t1_duuli4w	0	*	That's some fine social darwinist thought there. If we ('we' being the industrialised world) don't need to do it, and there's pragmatic drawbacks to it, why consume animals at all?
t1_duv5i53	1	*	Same to you! 
t1_duunfqp	1	*	And stupid shit like this is why I haven't set foot in that beautiful shithole for the past 16 years.
t1_duujjvi	0	*	Yet you still side stepped the middle East occupation. 
t1_duum4un	0	*	This seems like an odd statement, given that Trump is not the first president whose office was one with foreign influence.
t1_duub9lh	1	*	Tally-ho old chaps
t1_duuip11	1	*	But that's literally just the culture of the outside world speaking, then.
t1_duut751	0	*	Not all Brits get like this over the Falklands. Just the stupid ones. I assume similar in Argentina

t1_duum4od	0	*	>And able to be killed quickly and painlessly.  **able**  i.e. It is possible, but nobody actually does it.
t1_duxn1al	1	*	Hillary wasn't. Trump is a Russian puppet with ties to China who is presently being investigated by the rest of the government.  Meanwhile, the president of China is making himself dictator for life.
t1_duusiql	0	*	You seem intelligent
t1_duul9xx	0	*	As a brown man, I find that offensive. You're putting me in *The Sunken Place*. Nazi scumbag.

t1_duv4kc3	1	*	And then what?  How is that going to help during something like Libya back in 2011?  The UK and France wished they had more carriers then.
t1_duxddsa	0	*	But, again, you're not allowed to do that. It's an unprovoked attack on a civilian ship.
t1_duuv64s	1	*	Aahahaha we easily kicked your dumb asses and you still whine away 'but if' this and that. We destroyed you in less than 3 months. But suuuure you were reeeally close haha. Dumb dead fucks.

t1_duuuzse	1	*	Lmao that's a hell of a theory. The rest of the world thinks the UK has an elite fleet of ultra-silent submarines and in reality they just never leave home. 
t1_dt8s6d6	0	*	Since when is journalism a hypothetical job?
t1_dt90oqr	1	*	He was fired for the memo he wrote. It had nothing to do with him being a white guy

t1_dtx57e9	0	*	If many military officals do the same and govt don't stop them, then I say it is what the govt wants to do.
t1_dtx59n3	1	*	First you were trying g to justify the action of the military offical. Now you are saying it is his fault and govt don't have anything to do with it.
t1_du6a8f4	0	*	 Sure, could be hot. Where you live?   (And my comment was a quote, implying that's what you said...)
t1_du0cwfq	1	*	His first statement never said men don't get raped, I'm confused what the squabble is about.  Seems like you're the one utilizing semantics to belittle someone and be in the right.

t1_du0c3re	0	*	> Everyone who disagrees with me ideologically is a child!  Do you even listen to yourself?

t1_dsj8k5t	1	*	What's with the straight white male nonsense? 
t1_dsgx9lg	0	*	See you say the word survive, but survive doesn't mean bare minimum to you. 
t1_dsgxnn0	0	*	See a roof above your head and a flat are so different too. 
t1_dshkvnn	0	*	Why not $20 an hour?  Economists say the government dictating a minimum market wage does not make sense in a free market economy.
t1_dsgwr57	0	*	Stop swearing and counter his points like a big boy/girl or don't talk at all. 
t1_dsh5xrf	1	*	Try this one [instead:](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/7pewgj/canadians_are_mad_as_hell_at_tim_hortons_boycotts/dsgztbf/?st=jc9bl749&sh=3af9fc03)

t1_dshf4vc	0	*	You would be incorrect.
t1_dshs8cg	0	*	Nope. The minimim wage is the lowest amount an employer is legally able to pay an employee. It's unfortunate you want to pretend like you get to chose the definition of words.
t1_dsgut4c	0	*	If people don't get their upper class coffee, they aren't dieing. It's why garbage men actually make good money. They are needed in society and work hard. Coffee shop employees not really. 
t1_dskk4p5	0	*	I do care for other people. Which is why I give time and money to charity. Government is not the only avenue, and it's a horribly inefficient forced one at that. 
t1_dsjetj6	0	*	Look at those numbers and tell me which one is more gradual and easier to adjust too, and which one is done basically overnight. So thank you for agreeing with me.

t1_dsho9yh	0	*	Oh... This article refers to an Ontario tim hortons chain. And is in reference to how our min wage just went from 11.60 to 14$. Scheduled to go up to 15$ nextjanuary aswell
t1_dsh8e31	0	*	Sears died at the local mall, mall is still doing fine.   Are you overestimating the appeal of Sears, or do you live in an area where Sears is the only thing around?

t1_dshnonx	1	*	Exactly my parents' philosophy and exactly my plan as well.
t1_dshbscg	0	*	Why would someone raise a child on minimum wage? Sounds like bad decisions to me.
t1_dsh8ywf	0	*	I think you're missing the point. It was highly upvoted for one, so clearly people agree, and also these kinds of things are posted all the time. 
t1_dsi5t5u	0	*	900 a month...... Move out of your liberal hell hole that has a a ton of building restrictions. 300 a month can feed multiple families beans and rice btw
t1_dsh4z94	0	*	Where did I say I was leaving?  Care to actually discuss anything written?

t1_dsmk6wb	1	*	Clearly, it's okay to blindly accept the news as long as it caters to your own biases.
t1_dsly4yv	1	*	If you thinking mocking an accent is the same as systemic racial oppression that occurred in the past, then you're delusional.
t1_dslz9n8	0	*	But Im not lying. Youre just wrong. The fact is that 4 senators agree he said it, while Trumps best defense is 2 who dont remember and himself.

t1_dsm6egg	0	*	Well I can tell you that in expat-filled countries in the arabian gulf the very first question people ask each other is where are you from? Totally independent to their own ethnicity
t1_dsn1qgh	0	*	Oh so if some poor schmuck has an accent then you can ask them where are you from?   This exchange seems like a crash course in hypocrisy.

t1_dulsezk	0	*	Oh no! We lost soft power. Thanks for the buzzword Mr adult.   Also, how do you feel ashamed when you didn't vote for the president? It's out of your hands at that point. 
t1_dulzqzm	0	*	Huh? So your argument is now: in order for something to be unreasonable, the definition of it must mention that it is unreasonable. Come on, think this stuff through before you type it.
t1_dulg2yw	1	*	The American economic model has lifted more from poverty worldwide than any modern force. 
t1_dun10up	0	*	But if you suggest this view for gun control your a child killing monster.
t1_dumcloz	0	*	Couldn't you say the same thing about your average *conservative* voters? 
t1_dur987l	0	*	Yeah.... I specifically said another country, as in any country that isn't the US.  That's embarrasing for you.  Maybe try to read slower next time.
t1_dulpbsm	1	*	If only. :(
t1_dumhxmu	1	*	Yep sometimes it's unintentional. Sometimes it's intentional. I'm with you on that one. 
t1_duohuhb	0	*	Maybe some day. It would certainly require the average person to put a lot more energy into the structure of their own society. 
t1_dunr1mu	1	*	Such ignorance.  Enjoy your borscht, don't drink too much vodka.  
t1_dulnzrh	0	*	No youre not dude. Youre trying to establish a premise, in an otherwise reasonable discussion, that everyone who disagrees with your particular viewpoint is a bigot or a troll. 
t1_dtal1op	0	*	Fines for speech is not an acceptable answer either.  Keep working on another way to be proactive that isn't ridiculous.
t1_dt9i2lw	0	*	Just to clarify, you are saying 1 and 2 and 3 have to occur in order to incur a fine?   Or are you saying you will get a fine if you do even just one of those three things?

t1_dssopee	0	*	You mean that land that they were forced from? The Jews were there long before any Arabs
t1_dstas30	1	*	> The last time both parties came to the table in good faith, and it failed, the blame was put upon Israel.  When do you think that happened?
t1_dst87vo	0	*	I know. Jews were discriminated around the world, both before and after WW2. But why would it be the Palestinians to pay the price with their territory?
t1_dtb0ch3	0	*	So then the African's in Israel are invaders by your logic
t1_dtbczq5	1	*	No, it's actually not.  Since your argument is actually a sidestep and not an answer to the actual question. 
t1_dtb0aum	1	*	Resorting to personal attacks for my own opinion that im entitled to?  Keep it classy. 
t1_dtg8py6	1	*	except that pretty much anyone living on the tribal land is in the tribe

t1_dtw4qqm	1	*	Jesus God that sucks ass
t1_dsqdgcp	1	*	Because i understand no one is perfect and each race has a group of narrowminded people who cause issues? Ok 
t1_dsqgwzz	1	*	They knew it was doxxing, they thought it could have been Doxxing the crime
t1_dsq5k4k	1	*	A shallot is the bastard child of a garlic and an onion.
t1_dsvkbal	1	*	I disagree.
t1_dsqews6	0	*	I think you need to work on your reading comprehension then mate. How the fuck is that not doxxing clearly implies to me that there is something entailed by doxxing, i.e. legal punishment.
t1_dsra10s	0	*	Who said anything about Charlottesville?   It's just that both subs are representing the political extreme.   Is it that hard to understand?
t1_dsq5j69	0	*	Maybe everybody should stop indoctrinating their kids in their belief systems from a young age. Up to and including Sunday school.
t1_dsqk4x7	1	*	TheAmazingEtc has no idea what they're talking about to be quite frank. Canada has some of the tightest immigration laws in the Western world.

t1_dsq7g5u	0	*	I make a law saying that veils that cover the face can't be worn. I didn't explicitly say a race, but it still mainly targets religions who wear veils. It's racist, but I didn't say a race.
t1_dsqr0xd	0	*	The only one of those that is a current law is affirmative action which is race based discrimination against white and asian people. It doesn't prove your point. 
t1_dsr296f	1	*	So if they don't have the discussion, they're not allowed to have *any* discussion?  When do you plan to give them permission to exercise their first amendment rights?
t1_dsqma70	0	*	It still benefited him. He very much ran as Anti-Obama. Sure Hillary was a much weaker candidate but lying your ass off seems to be a sure fire way to be the president now.   
t1_dss7v5y	0	*	> Some deep south states even gave social workers the authority to sterilize people...  The deep south was not conservative on this issue at the time that eugenics started gaining traction.
t1_dsqvmia	0	*	Nazi's don't own the Swastika. The Swastika is a sacred religious symbol discovered independently by multiple ancient cultures around the world.

t1_dsqbqe4	0	*	Do you have any reaction to being contradicted other than assuming the person is too dumb to know to agree with you? You haven't said a thing except to shout your baseless opinion and scoff
t1_dsq6bsc	1	*	You changed the scope from systemic to a few anecdotes.   You can keep moving the goalposts all you want but I didn't come here to say that Canada was perfect.

t1_ds561sp	1	*	Of course you'd think that's the only reason why I called attention to your comments. Keep trying.
t1_ds5kflg	1	*	It's not generosity either. Getting the citizens of a country you were at war with on your side to some degree is a cost savings. The US doesn't do anything from the kindness of it's heart.
t1_ds5l08c	1	*	I am well aware of what the MI5 and Scotland mean. I am also well aware that their allegiances don't lie with Pakistan or Benazir.

t1_dt1idtt	1	*	It was a rhetorical question. That's why I answered it.
t1_dt1fx61	1	*	Eh, corrupt and qualified aren't mutually exclusive.  Even if clinton was corrupt she was way more qualified than Sanders and Trump combined.

t1_dv3raa1	1	*	I quite literally thought that you were arguing in favor of 45's ability to pull off the sanctions in the beginning.   So yeah, essentially, we agree with one another. Yikes.
t1_dv1uwn9	1	*	I'm guessing they are as accurate as Trump when talking about their money.
t1_dv22rxo	1	*	Yeah no time for trumpets, yet you keep replying.  You have all the time in the world, you are a communist. It's safe to assume you are since it was safe for you to assume I was a Trump fan.

t1_duhvvb3	1	*	Yeah dude, I think the FBI considers sovcits and similar to be the biggest terrorist threat in the US, not religiously motivated foreign threats (e.g., Muslims).

t1_dsrx41g	0	*	hmmm OK so the monks are all in Italy remotely controlling a telescope?

t1_dt10xuc	1	*	Damn. Well, I stand corrected. Went and read a bunch of papers and you're right. Apparently, much like Carson Daly, we peaked in the 90s.
t1_dszw2ly	0	*	Kind of find it funny you've been trying to explain a concept as simple as that to people over here.. 
t1_dt0dhy3	1	*	 The truth is that everyone is an idiot, the difference comes from the fact that some realise they're idiots, while other's don't.

t1_dt009fs	0	*	You think a billionaire wouldnt have extremely valuable items in their multimillion dollar mansion? 
t1_dszxasz	0	*	Nope. He'll win the next election and maybe the one after that. Keep trying to spread that hate all you want, but it's not going to work.

t1_dszu4gz	0	*	Yea it isn't. But billionaire execs hiring contract killers to kill another billionaire exec is. You REALLY think this was business related? His company produced generics...
t1_dt08s4q	1	*	The police are not pressured to give the family what they want, a PI might be because he wants to give them what they want. 
t1_dszxq1f	1	*	What the devil are you talking about? I'm not a fan but he's been doing a pretty decent job of being PM.  CERTAINLY better than either of the other two options would have been. 
t1_dt0decn	1	*	 Yeah, but if ten people are at 100, two are at 120, and two at 80, half the people are not under 100.

t1_dt4rs9w	0	*	If your neighbor's smoke is billowing through your bedroom window you should absolutely complain. Doesn't matter if it's weed smoke, tobacco smoke or BBQ smoke - you shouldn't have to live like that.

t1_dsk4p5l	1	*	Taiwan does not reject being part of China. Taiwan rejects being part of the People's Republic of China, and considers itself a government in exile. 
t1_dsk6cjo	0	*	Fair enough. Im making a statement based explicitly on a single instance I have seen. 
t1_dsk9bi0	1	*	No, we just take it out of our history books, and have a large portion of the country who still feels that Manifest Destiny was justifiable.
t1_dsl8cjn	1	*	Do American schools teach children that standalone Wikipedia is an acceptable source? At least link the sources credited on the Wikipedia page.
t1_dsl3brh	1	*	I get where you are coming from (on how we Koreans and Chinese are collectively mad at Japan) but I don't think nationalistic is a word to describe that phenomenon. 
t1_dsjx7n8	1	*	I'm referring to the Japanese tactic of building military bases and factories in civilian cities. Not the draft.
t1_dsjvhfj	1	*	> nearest major city to Kure - a major Japanese naval base and shipyard.  Why didn't they bombed Kure directly?
t1_dsjy3m6	0	*	Had to do it in such a way that it showed its power, and that the Japanese could not cover it up from their people.  Also scare the Russians
t1_ds91uy1	1	*	Yes they are the reason, because they lobby for it.  Do you know ANYONE in your life that has started a business in the last 5 years?
t1_ds8qvlx	0	*	Yes but industry standards say %25 profit margin is considered good. I would want to see some pretty compelling evidence for any business claiming only %5 PM.

t1_dsag0pz	0	*	Yeah, and when youre an asshole to on the internet real people get hurt. Something tells me youre revolting to be around. 
t1_ds8gm6d	0	*	So you admit they come out on top? So all this people won't invest in businesses is bullshit since they still come out on top. Glad we agree.  
t1_ds8wwzc	1	*	I think it just has to do with their names.  Look at the Shadowrun setting, where you have brands like RealFood^TM
t1_ds9347b	0	*	Hypotheses aren't evidence. Having to dismiss that criticism as a technicality really shows how weak your argument's support it.
t1_ds91wgt	0	*	If everybody saves 10 cents on a burger, then it's better for society very plainly. I'm very sorry if you're a little slow witted, but please try to keep up. This is why we no longer sell buggy whips

t1_dtin9pv	0	*	>those pathetic parents who take their shithead kids  Sounds like your parents didn't raise you to be polite enough.
t1_dthp2vt	0	*	It's not lazy in that it required little effort to enforce, it's lazy in that they decided to blanket ban something in order to avoid teaching you the lessons that they should be teaching you.

t1_dtdiek6	1	*	I just don't get it. It's Donald Trump. There is endless material to mock the guy for, but we choose to mock the slightly dated expression that he uses? And we mock it by pretending to not know it? 
t1_dtd21bh	0	*	Basically everything thats not climate change. 
t1_dtfz4sg	1	*	This has been happening to the people of the Netherlands for centuries. So much so that their people have considered the idea of seasteading as a very real possibility.
t1_dtd5zzb	0	*	So, you see a superficial gesture as more important than actually fighting climate change? 
t1_dtdt1s9	1	*	Not if people start voting in primaries and stop voting for someone in the primaries based on name recognition and what corporate media says.

t1_dupqj6k	0	*	Damn u people are dumb. 
t1_dupmd1n	0	*	It is very much in the interest of the US these days as Turkey has proven to be an unreliable ally. We may well need to replace them in the not too distant future.
t1_dt9v7ds	1	*	No apologies needed, it takes two to tango as they say!
t1_dtaehto	1	*	Well, male ants have a very limited role indeed. The point is that anyone who thinks being a male in human society is a privilege by default seriously needs their heads examined.
t1_dt8s9bd	0	*	Are you making another argument but this time saying I implied it rather than some people may think? You must entertain yourself greatly.
t1_dt8v1e8	1	*	 The idea was always to promote fairness.  It is still to promote fairness.  But the enemies of the idea are not interested in facts.
t1_dt91y6s	0	*	I suggest not getting pulled into an exchange with that person. It will go nowhere, do nothing for you on an intellectual level, and get repetitive very quickly.

t1_duiewsd	0	*	Feudalism is also dumb, if that's what you were after.
t1_dui8032	0	*	> There really shouldn't be people that rich.  Holy shit I am glad Reddit in no way represents the majority of people in this country.
t1_duicgao	1	*	I understand that, but moving to a different neighborhood in the same city (as I originally mentioned) is almost always a possibility. 
t1_duiad8p	0	*	I'm sure there is a system to avoid this. At least on ONE of the many, many existing federal states
t1_duib1g5	1	*	That's what I payed outside of Baltimore. So happy to be in Gerogia now.
t1_duicd8d	0	*	oh good god
t1_duiess1	0	*	Yeah, there's like 25% of the country that would rather you didn't know the facts because it's bad for their team.  This knowledge should really be required to pass high school.

t1_duie72r	0	*	Yeah Im not gonna gamble with millions of peoples lives to be a badass. 
t1_duiljpv	1	*	Go look at the data, most did not pay that number and it greatly hindered the economy.  The is why JFK ran as a tax-slasher.  I say that as a non-registered hater of both parties.

t1_duid5mg	0	*	You know what, so let's tax it all your money 75% because why not, we already tax all your earnings multiple times.
t1_duijodo	1	*	Pell system would fold if every kid claimed they were independent.  There is an option that college financial aid administrators can use for students that are truly independent.  
t1_duiek11	0	*	The government taking your money to use for whatever purposes they see fit doesn't sound like me investing in society.
t1_duiaz6m	1	*	Subpar studio for $2,100 in NYC checking in
t1_duifi3r	0	*	Why is this? Why do people do this? Why is it that as soon as I start saying stuff I get called a communist? Did the 1960s really burn America this bad? 
t1_duiteao	1	*	I wish you the best of luck. I'm looking at AZ and NV but there's not much of work for me there.
t1_duinivn	1	*	No I don't expect anyone to do anything. Unfulfilled expectations are a huge let down.

t1_duijl13	0	*	For $150K in NYC the $1K/mo (which is after taxes) is ~12% of the 'take home pay'.
t1_duih5tx	0	*	I'm aware of this. I'm saying though outside of like the very very top echelon of cities that's all easily affordable with 150k a year of income. 
t1_duiffmm	0	*	That communism is shit and morally abhorrent, and the only way to have a tax system where the rich do not have more post-tax income is through communism.
t1_duifvz1	1	*	$60k is in the top 20% of individual incomes, not household. 
t1_duib5mr	1	*	And I completely forgot that employer matching doesnt count towards max contribution SMH......
t1_duinxjd	1	*	My experience dealing with government run healthcare is abysmal, won't recommend to anyone. It's 'cheaper' but only if you don't care about quality or time-to-doctor.
t1_duia6ja	0	*	All salary information about anyone other than executives isn't collected other than through self-reporting. All salary statistics will be self-reported.

t1_duiq8md	1	*	Yeah that's not true at all
t1_dui99ri	0	*	Well of course investment wouldn't disappear altogether, but a significant portion would. Investment is already risky as it is, by taxing it you'd logically  just scare more people away.
t1_dujkyj2	1	*	That blows my dude
t1_duif2pn	1	*	Call them loopholes, deductions, exemptions, credits, whatever -- Yeah I agree that a progressive tax system will **necessarily** also create progressive incentives to lower one's tax burden.
t1_duihpcf	1	*	factcheck.org is not a valid source for crap.  That's like saying CNN or Fox is a valid source for news and quality journalism.

t1_duib6r8	1	*	Go live outside. It's cheaper /s
t1_dui9bgt	0	*	What do you consider non-civilized then?  Regardless, even if you take away over 2/3rds of the countries, being #14 out of 50 is not dismal, just proves that you don't know what you're talking about.
t1_duidggx	0	*	That's retarded though. Why even have a president at all if he has nothing to say? That's just wasted tax-money.
t1_duib53c	1	*	$1800 a month for a semi-updated 1 br in Chicago. Tack on another 240 for parking.

t1_duz6xq3	0	*	You must have loved the Obama years. The economy was *kicking ass*.
t1_duzav1w	0	*	Sure, or having your friends die on the road, etc.  There are costs in all of these things.  The biggest costs are when we allow ourselves to be goaded into a disproportionate response.
t1_duzvams	0	*	Thanks for proving my point. The fact that you think the slave labour happening in Qatar is anywhere near labor violations that occur in the states shows you have no idea what you're talking about. 
t1_dskxhkm	1	*	No.

t1_dsd6ap4	0	*	Russia is a threat. They actively influenced the elections and helped get us Trump who is a danger to everyone.  The WH pushing propaganda isn't on me, and we are discussing Russia.
t1_dsda9fg	0	*	It was only one of the largest land armies at the time. No biggie. We used superior technology, so technically the victory didn't count?  This is what you're trying to say?

t1_dug3ii2	0	*	So... pirates attack oil carriers that are fishing in Somali waters?   How much do you know of Geography and shipping lanes?   
t1_duxtf0z	1	*	I'll add Admit that you're not a genius to the list of things I shouldn't do in an honest discussion, then.
t1_duwj7yg	1	*	Funny you say that, I'm actually known for my enjoyable and well mannered murderous outbreaks. 
t1_dux2xp0	1	*	I don't know whos the salty cunt downvoting. Fucking drug addicted snowflakes
t1_dup2ezj	1	*	No, its Casablanca. Funny scene too. Movie that is popular to critics as well as the unwashed audience, unlike Citizen Kane.
t1_dupml4u	1	*	Half a gram of cocaine? That's, like, practically no cocaine at all.
t1_duovts5	0	*	Is this a verbose meme or something? Or are you just pretentious?

t1_dup4osy	1	*	it is, it's a more pure smokable form.
t1_dupi8q8	1	*	It really does smell good. Good coke you can smell through the bag. But then again, it probably smells terrible but I just associate it with the high.

t1_duplaie	0	*	I love that on the internet a 747 made out of cocaine is reasonable.
t1_dupenwz	1	*	I heard the russians are polluting the argentinian environment with huge empty plastic bags!
t1_duouu37	0	*	That not cocaine, it's flour. 
t1_dup8rqt	1	*	Alright, I'll defer to you, I don't do crack lol
t1_dts4f2x	0	*	When did Stalin enact that policy?  When did NK enact it?  Countries of all types have similar policies.

t1_dsusa9b	1	*	Or... I just hate fish...
t1_dt3jtoa	1	*	Yes.. its even stated in the video... And the 2 times that I have had it, I can say without a doubt that its bland. 
t1_dtpsxh6	1	*	Would the spec have changed over the years though? I know fighter jets tend to be difficult to retrofit, but there have been a whole bunch of variants of the aircraft over the years. 
t1_dtose8a	0	*	With a service ceiling of 45,000 ft I think it would have to.
t1_dtqkydn	0	*	Where did your elementary school field trip take you to, the zoo? Congrats man. Lol all that random cussing proves it. Puberty will be tough time buddy but you'll be okay.
t1_dtovgap	0	*	The A-10 can carry 2-6 Mavericks and 2 sidewinders. It will also usually carry at least 14 folding fin unguided rockets (but up to 76 if needed) so yes the majority of it's armament is unguided.
t1_dtp1wv5	0	*	You misunderstand me, you asked why it was a war crime, and that's why it was a war crime, it's understandable that they would want to kill the pilot, but that doesn't mean it's okay.
t1_dtp0ynb	0	*	Trying reading some books or even just Wikipedia sometime. I'll get you started check out the rape of berlin.
t1_dtp36oa	1	*	Then he wasn't unarmed and this discussion doesn't count
t1_dtos3n2	1	*	of course. 
t1_dtosovz	0	*	To get around it, apparently they used gas canisters half-buried in the ground, not projectiles.  *Hardcore History* man, good stuff. 
t1_dtpuejj	0	*	We weren't discussing how to change it though. We were talking about what was right and wrong. They were attacking people, their job is literally to attack people. 
t1_dtomdkh	1	*	Okay.
t1_dtomwnp	1	*	I agree. They probably laugh at the idea of those laws applying to them.
t1_dtpoy73	0	*	Well, let's start with VVS being VKS for some years already (Vozdushno-Kosmicheskie Sily,  Air and Space Force); should we continue fact-checking your rant ?
t1_dtou6ef	1	*	well, if you have Assad on one side and bunch of terrorists, who want to enfore sharia law, on the other, a lot of people choose Assad, even through he is considered evil.
t1_dtonccc	1	*	You'd have to eat horseshoes for breakfast.   Unless you're shooting at a thin-skinned OH-58 Kiowa (o7 *you crazy fuckers*) or a MH-6.
t1_dtozi6z	0	*	But, what you said is incorrect though. American and European planes both pull G's hard enough that they incapacitate pilots. They have since the very beginning and still do.
t1_dtpd9tj	1	*	I'm not quite sure how we got a canuck spook posting here, but your shit checks out.
t1_dtppwq9	0	*	ok
t1_dtpw5ir	1	*	A-10 has a very limited SEAD ability due to its slow speed and inability to carry anti-radiation missiles. That duty is left to the F-16 or F/A-18.
t1_dtoywyt	1	*	Um, they were extensive & pervasive... throughout the war and across eastern europe & germany.
t1_dtqfffo	0	*	Terrorbombing was a strategy used almost exclusively by luftwaffe.

t1_dtp1fp9	0	*	Just a layperson guessing, but wouldn't they have made significant changes and upgrades to these planes in the last 40 years?
t1_dsgdhsr	1	*	Hell, the Yucatxe1n is safer than many parts of the states
t1_dsdljyb	1	*	>Is that really enough to make it SJW propaganda?  I dunno man, I don't think they're SJW propaganda.  I do think they're shit films tho.
t1_dsds4y9	1	*	Uhh... okay...
t1_dsenxyz	1	*	Even french press needs 30gr of ground beans for 500ml. Hardly miniscule compare to 1-3gr of gold plating in a fucking 1-3 kg of hardware, doesn't it? 
t1_dsdeu65	1	*	> Nothing has changed since the crash.  The price has changed.  Hence the crash.  Seeing as a bubble is a phenomena primarily concerned with price, that is hardly incidental.
t1_dsdjldc	0	*	Calm down. He wasn't trying to correct you: He was merely pointing out that you're stupid. 
t1_dsdexow	0	*	> its lack of real value has so far not deterred investment. Something is giving it value, because at this time, it has value.   Yeah, its called *hype*.

t1_dtmjmdn	1	*	The irony here is beautiful.
t1_dtmvdvv	0	*	Like Russia collusion?
t1_dtn15l9	0	*	I'm sure massive firings also have nothing to do with the tax cuts as well.   If you want to keep being disingenuous about what's going on here, I don't see any reason to continue this conversation. 
t1_dtmmsm5	0	*	7th largest economy by GDP.  Not the _very_ top, but hardly irrelevant.

t1_dtmx22s	0	*	Yes he gave a very informed write up with currently 1500 upvotes, and what do you know....https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/7uqcyv/france_to_trump_no_paris_agreement_no_trade/dtmhsf9 
t1_dtn4ugc	0	*	you realize that people who have money in Canada come to america to have important medical procedures, right? Relax with the Canada matters talk plz lol
t1_dtn9mrp	1	*	>We could completely collapse and China would recover in 2 years  Imagine actually believing this lol. A collapse of the US would devastate the globe for decades.  
t1_dtmpm2k	0	*	You mean an assistant to a minister? Basically a secretary?
t1_dtmsbe0	1	*	Shit son YOU TELL EM.
t1_dtnavd6	1	*	Not after production moves to Wisconsin.  
t1_dtmq2z1	0	*	Right... so the gist of the tweet is that he has a desire to influence the EU in this manner, which is still quite a few steps removed from:  > France to Trump: No Paris Agreement, no trade agreement
t1_dtmtg49	0	*	If it's nasty enough a VM won't protect your host. The host/VM barrier can be broken.
t1_dtmjv9j	0	*	Lol what? I can't tell if this actually happened or if you are biased as fuck.

t1_dtmkslm	0	*	That's nice . I said was the sources were obscure and I lean right , and that's all it took to get vitriolic talk about our president.  Try not to get so easily triggered , it's too stressful .
t1_dtmraz1	0	*	So US airplane companies arent saving money by buying domestic but rather importing and being exposed to exchange rates?   Sure man, whatever you say. 
t1_dtmknrp	1	*	the_dildo posters like the one you replied to have been trying to draw false equivalency between td and politics for months now.
t1_dtn3xqw	1	*	It's true and [has been confirmed](https://twitter.com/MalmstromEU/status/959114117490585600) by EU commissionner Cecilia Malmstrom
t1_dsg9c24	1	*	That's for the us. I doubt it's the same in Iraq. 
t1_dsfma1g	0	*	Explain.
t1_dsg4bu3	0	*	Ah, I think I may have been extrapolating from the prior poster. Your post seemed to be broadly in support of their theme, so I guess I assumed that it followed a similar line of thinking.
t1_dsgcnyg	0	*	Umm, 2001 isn't a documentary, dude.  The vast majority of archaeological evidence suggests that conflict over resources in pre-agricultural society was mostly settled by relocation, not war. 
t1_duuquxp	0	*	Right, got it, so everyone is lying except Turkey.   No problem, have a good day.
t1_duxcrr7	0	*	Go back to your cave pathetic virgin scum.

t1_ds1qaed	0	*	your parents were involved in the coup? Did they took part against the PM of that time?
t1_dskgsdu	0	*	I kind of agree with you there - but it is most likely the most recognisable city in the world. Apart from maybe Sydney.
t1_dslc2gw	1	*	I had saved up for 2.5 years if that makes you feel any better. I'm also single and don't really buy that much.
t1_dsm2ug4	0	*	Ah, so only developed Christian nations count.  Move those goal posts.  
t1_dskldxh	0	*	Youre ignorant, Im sorry. 
t1_dtefv8i	0	*	its a biased source. a map made by kurds, to show which regions are kurdish. no one from the region would accept the map, only western audience who doesnt know much about the region.
t1_dtfm774	0	*	Tell that to the millions of innocent muslim civilians in villages that were slaughtered in cold blood. 
t1_dtfhc2n	0	*	Thank you for explaining patiently. Should Israel take away schools teaching arabic as first language then? Or should Turkey start teaching Kurdish as first language?
t1_dsrx8z1	1	*	You can stop a quarrel before it starts.
t1_dscgqwo	1	*	> how will protesting trump get a better trade deal?  **You were the one that brought up getting a better trade deal...**
t1_dsbpa1n	0	*	The protests are always more a declaration of the disgust that the British public have with Trump.  Nobody takes Trump seriously, and as such nobody really *wants* to do business with him.
t1_dscb9gf	0	*	> all it can do is strain UK - US relations  That would be ideal to be honest. Don't want May getting any crazy ideas from the Orangutan - we're already dealing with #brexit.

t1_dtmypt9	1	*	You're being civil on reddit? ugh, freak
t1_dtn75bc	0	*	Because Muslims either wiped out Christians by violence or pressured them to convert.  The historical record strongly suggests we cannot coexist in the long run.
t1_dtn8802	1	*	Lol
t1_dtnsvu6	0	*	No, that would be Bulgaria. I believe they meant the white aquatic mammal, most commonly found in the Arctic Ocean
t1_dtnv9x4	1	*	Im so sorry good sir, it appears as if you have confused Bulgaria with that region in the western Czech Republic.
t1_dtnxrs2	1	*	Sorry friend, thats Bosnia. I think your referring to the sash that Worf wears. 
t1_du1bi5l	0	*	Just using the words you gave. 
t1_du0jrnt	1	*	You can make that argument *without* the Nazi comparison, that's my point.  At this point I'm just repeating myself in 3 different conversations. So, I'm done. I made my point.

t1_duss053	1	*	Not cause of his political savvyness, thats for sure!
t1_dutgeh4	0	*	I don't think you can say Obama was worse when his counterpart started an illegitimate war. Obama did not start any wars. And regardless, Trump has been worse than both of them combined.

t1_dutu896	1	*	Okay, so I guess it's more understandable you're arguing in logical fallacies.
t1_dusqc9j	1	*	You can disagree with facts all you like, but it won't make those facts disappear. 
t1_dusjo28	0	*	Quite simple. 
t1_dusjq38	0	*	Honestly I've killed a fuck ton of people. I think I killed... everyone... almost.... in Riverwood. I killed someone in falkreath and was very displeased to learn there's no guild presence there :(.

t1_dutqd2b	0	*	Lol well it doesnt make me feel any better knowing the most powerful country in the world is full of trump supporters U0001f602
t1_dusjh07	0	*	Yeah, spending $40b to build a wall that will save us a few million per year sounds like a great idea. 
t1_dut12fl	1	*	How about we also add the cost of creating Obamas library and instead use that money as well to make a better camera and drone system. 
t1_duspwce	1	*	Then that doesn't fall under border security. ICE needs to step it up. 
t1_dusn7bg	1	*	:)

t1_dusk6oi	0	*	The US never has ruled the world or aimed to rule the world despite what people like you constantly accuse them of trying to do.  I said they were the steward and indeed they are. 
t1_dusurgf	1	*	Actually, the US defines mass shooting as a shooting involving five or more victims, this includes when there are 5 injured and no deaths.

t1_dv15tnz	1	*	The US did not enter WW2 for the sake of economic superiority, it entered because it was directly attacked by Japan...
t1_dv14e05	0	*	Give Robbaz a hug for us? <3
t1_dv1kapa	1	*	Context is important. Take your pedantry elsewhere.
t1_dv1311c	0	*	Still don't see respectable historians as sources. Only more anti-Soviet and anti-Stalin propaganda.
t1_dv0irvs	0	*	So...no comment on anything else I've said. Just pointing out something I said three comments ago.
t1_dv0ncuk	0	*	Im sure the Greeks would like back a piece of Ionia.  They could just as easily turn East as West depending on what Russia offers.    Real greaseball stuff is in the works people.   
t1_dtac3dx	1	*	I didn't mean the city as in singular and referring to London :).  More of a general term for urban areas.
t1_dt9um49	1	*	We do it all the time with satellites and probes. At least this is an art piece 
t1_dtap8ij	1	*	Lol. I just wanted to share this with you. It's just... Great...
t1_duz0u8d	0	*	Just so we're clear, you've moved on from your confabulated, occupying a territory makes all people in that territory full citizens Law of Zefiax that is totally 100% how international law works?  
t1_ds2iz7c	1	*	I agree
t1_du5yrcd	1	*	Mr. Deripaska was plowing that pussy.   
t1_du8ehgl	0	*	Yes, because I think the Chinese legal system has a single good idea, that means I think they're all good ideas!
t1_du8k22v	0	*	Yeah, some of the worst holes in Canada. Lovely...
t1_du8xzsq	0	*	Insurance man.... Insurance.
t1_du92zts	0	*	Thats too bad the government is willing to let foreigners destroy the prospects of its own citizens for no good reason. 
t1_du8fj29	0	*	>You can go to Calgary,Winnipeg, Saskatoon, St. John's, Ottawa... all have dirt cheap housing.  I'll have what you're smokin.  
t1_du97ngo	0	*	What? This makes zero sense.
t1_du940pq	1	*	Nah, 600k gets you mansions in Chicagos farther suburbs. 
t1_du8oz7u	0	*	Your claiming foreigners can't afford Chinese real estate, what?
t1_du8yiuy	1	*	What the fuck are you talking about? I don't understand why people like you just pull shit out of their ass to post on reddit. What do you gain by bullshitting to strangers?
t1_du8fgdg	0	*	Yes, it there a problem with that ?
t1_du8khlg	0	*	This has nothing to do with authoritarianism vs democracy. If a country democratically decides to ban foreigners from owning houses if they don't live in them, thats an entirely democratic decision. 
t1_ducvg1b	0	*	Was with my realtor friend yesterday, and Butterfly is selling at $4000 per sqft 
t1_du8v0z0	0	*	So cheaper than Vancouver - at least Moscow is a metropolis - Vancouver is just a small city with some crime ridden neighbourhoods and a lot of Asian investment. 
t1_du95nb8	1	*	Jesus, and i thought orlando Fl rent was bad.   I pay $650 a month for 2 bed 2 bath. Alonf with a roomate of course.

t1_du8hl1o	1	*	/s? ^pls
t1_dtw07xv	0	*	Oh man, why do you hate Poland and Polish people so much?
t1_dtuxnwl	0	*	Less stupid people could be a noun phrase with less as a qualifier of stupid - ex, He chose the less stupid of the choices
t1_dtvcu92	1	*	His point is that you're blaming people for prioritizing their friends and families over strangers.
t1_dtuk1fw	1	*	This is beautiful.
t1_dtvic94	1	*	That comment is just to show my displeasure and disagreement with the new law. Don't take it personally if it seemed like it man lol. But yea dude, thanks and good luck to your country as well :)
t1_dtudlnz	0	*	Slightly better time Yeah right... because occupation is such a great time. 
t1_dtvjczw	1	*	I honestly hope you are right. Time (and Poland's judicial branch) will tell.
t1_dtvm101	0	*	Yeah I'm gonna stop discussing with you, it's a bit like trying to bounce a ball off of pudding.
t1_dtz7co0	0	*	No, your sources are not good enough. They don't bring any facts at all. And no, not that addictive is not equal is not addictive.
t1_dtusg5f	1	*	Yeah I didn't think you had said anything against me there...just wicked confused...it's like people didn't read his post, or the part I had bolded for them lmao
t1_dtugstx	1	*	Nobody said it was healthy, it has some positive effects, thats it
t1_dtg7mug	1	*	So what you're saying is that Russians snuck into the US, thousands of miles away, to cast a single vote? And they basically elected Trump?
t1_dtgzfuo	0	*	Not in Germany. Not in a lot of European nations. But we're probably not 'developed' enough for a trumpbot.
t1_dth4ynv	1	*	You're literally covering your ears and going la l al ala la la, like a child. Your viewpoint is based on outdated information. You should check it out.
t1_dtffvsx	0	*	I don't. And I don't believe that Russia influenced our election. Hillary being a fake disgusting piece of shit influenced it. And for the record I didn't vote for Trump, I voted for Jill Stein.
t1_dteytr2	0	*	Le pomme de terre.
t1_du9jguo	0	*	Seems like good purposes. But volatility is bad for a currency, no?
t1_du997xo	1	*	Bitcoin mining on gpus is idiocy, I'm not sure you could even break even doing it on them anymore. Granted, they are great for other crypto especially asic resistant coins.
t1_du9exhq	0	*	...Which... Is related to safety?
t1_dutkxmh	0	*	Because I actually care about the well being of other people and have a decent understanding of economics.
t1_dt17xcl	0	*	Linke and Grxfcne are also at almost 20% together, so it's not that germans dont care about social policies, but that they dont trust the SPD anymore.
t1_dskovo3	1	*	Literally just Google it, it takes two seconds: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Authority_Martyrs_Fund
t1_dskycbt	1	*	So you were blaming the victims and my reading comprehension and the US school system great, right?  You sure you're ok?  
t1_dsmi8ju	0	*	None of those others are colonizing those territories. Occupied Palestine is not a disputed territory, it's an occupied country. 
t1_dt7kf6o	0	*	Thats because you have nothing and only wish you had something.  Trump is still your president, and will be for another 7 years
t1_dt86sjs	1	*	So? What did you find after researching it?
t1_dt790qd	1	*	So google it. You can read the case files for yourself. Everything in that article is correct.
t1_dt8jb18	1	*	French's is a surprisingly good company as far as what they put in their mustard for the price of it.  Although, I guess mustard in general is so simple that there's little reason to do otherwise.
t1_dt78vz1	1	*	Lol way to change a mind and make difference in the world. Enjoy the 8 years of Trump because people like you will get him re elected. 
t1_dt8xzx6	1	*	...everything nice...  did you find the powerpuff girls in there?
t1_dt9ukpt	0	*	I chose reuters as an example of how they twist shit in an article that should be positive. Sorry that went over your head.
t1_dtbbmjp	1	*	You sure? You get angry for no reason like he does.
t1_dtar4av	1	*	> Also last I saw he didn't fire Mueller.  Because more sensible people told him it's a fucking dumb idea.
t1_dtewnlr	0	*	Why the fuck are you commenting on this article then?  And why the hard on for Russia?
t1_dth5zri	0	*	For one thing, you edited your comment. Which shows. For another, you're still incorrect.
t1_dt8gllz	0	*	yeah definitely, depends where you live
t1_dt8kxji	0	*	Links?
t1_dt84zf6	0	*	Because every dog is the exact same and there are no differences between Labrador Retrievers and German Shepherds   
t1_dt85pgp	1	*	Good grief
t1_dt8q6rf	0	*	>and inevitably when  Sounds like your training method doesnt work that well...
t1_dtal9wy	0	*	And? If stupid assholes didnt have these collars to misuse they'd find some other way to mistreat the dog. Tarring a legitimate training tool as wrong because some asshat misuses it is asinine.
t1_dt8ovd6	0	*	Dogs aren't people
t1_dtyz3mp	0	*	Yeah, except libel, slander, Islamic extremism, perjury, anything that violates prior terms of agreement with private corporations and the government.
t1_dtzdivs	1	*	Nobody has ever suggested that, once again poking holes in your pathetic theory
t1_dtzlaxi	0	*	Because the constitutional court would stop it.
t1_dtzhmgo	0	*	It's called a republican democracy. 
t1_dtze1bj	0	*	It's certainly better than the alternative, counting elections by number of votes would make voting in the majority of states redundant.
t1_dtyxze6	0	*	Go to an airport and say you have a bomb. Let me know how it goes, since there are apparently no limitations. 
t1_dtzah3r	1	*	Yeah let's shape the argument so I am right. GG
t1_due282m	0	*	As I said...just another clueless kid.
t1_dtwrj5g	1	*	> but nobody in Israel wants to commit genocide on Arabs.  you sure about that?  it looks like the likud party is all about that, right now
t1_dtwsclu	0	*	join us at r/Neoliberal, the ideological trashcan, but ironically
t1_dtwwxe1	1	*	Hezbollah was literally formed as a response to Israeli occupation of Lebanon in the 80s.
t1_dtwssld	0	*	I'd agree with not as a country (especially since it's *not* a country), but they do more for the people in Gaza than the Egyptians or anyone else seems to want to do.
t1_dtx1f3j	0	*	You're easily amused.  Go back to eating your favourite flavour of crayon.
t1_dtwoj7a	1	*	Didn't realise every Hamas terrorist was a quadriplegic. 
t1_dtwnpdf	0	*	Yeah... that's not a thing maybe you'd like to provide a source for that
t1_dtwxrjd	1	*	wrap it up boys, lets go home.   *turns off the internet* 
t1_dtwpb4l	0	*	That was the reference I was getting at. Just trying to show how absurd the concept already is and how escalating it would be even more absurd.
t1_dtwwkw5	0	*	Troll.
t1_dtyeeet	0	*	Ah confused you with the other guy you both sounds the same. Bitter little cry babies 
t1_dtxnuwp	1	*	I have no strong feelings one way or the other. 
t1_dtxxht7	1	*	That because the us props Israel with billions in aid, while Palestinians are under military oppression and control.
t1_dtwzf1z	0	*	Oh ? With only 32000 people they got 15 members in the Senate ?
t1_dtwzk76	0	*	Who said that? I know I've seen whatever that's from but I just can't put my finger on it
t1_dtyubfl	1	*	Sexual Beer?
t1_dtxe8kw	1	*	do the almost daily stabbings not count?
t1_dtwshtm	0	*	Oh, so the vision of socialism is beginning to unify with the European definition then ?  Good for you. I'm left leaning but not socialist but I do think it may allow more sane debate.
t1_dtwuopk	1	*	He's banned from speaking at the Knesset for the next 6 months anyways for being an obnoxious idiot. He's always BBC's favorite MK to interview, though.
t1_dtwr22g	1	*	there's no desperate desire to stop violence. Just a shit-eating grin.
t1_dty7jtd	1	*	I know right? It's like refusing to negotiate with terrorists and then acting surprised when they kill the hostages.
t1_dtwpqas	1	*	Right.. thats why no one said anything of this sort. Why is this still being countered? Not once did this thread suggest it. 
t1_dtwskwd	1	*	Aren't politics and religion supposed to be separate by your constitution ? :D (just messing with you :p)
t1_dtz954i	0	*	You can't just ignore the part of reply that explains all the things the PA does not have control over and repeat the same nonsense. Try again.
t1_dtww256	1	*	The standard human attitude*
t1_dsq6vrj	0	*	How so. 
t1_dsqvg65	1	*	Hard to prove is better than not being able to prove and blanketly accusing all teens receiving nudes as criminal
t1_dsr7vu0	0	*	Get over yourself. If you think believing that monetary factors is a knee jerk reaction to the prison industrial complex, you can bug right off
t1_dstot8b	1	*	And to my knowledge N Korea has not done anything even remotely comparable to the invasion of the Sudetenland 
t1_dsu04zv	1	*	Yeah.
t1_dtk43r1	1	*	Solid cock bro, can I touch it?
t1_du3qd96	1	*	It mattered to you a little bit.
t1_ds3bjno	0	*	It creates an incentive to create automated systems that blanket ban any 'objectionable' content. WCGW?
t1_dshcty2	0	*	Tell me that you honestly think Trump is not literally losing his cognitive ability.
t1_dsgl8hz	1	*	It was the bankers, the people who took out loans they couldnt afford and the government who sponsored to whole ordeal.
t1_dshfbc0	1	*	> What client are you using that omitted that comment?  RIF
t1_dsgij1g	1	*	Yeah
t1_dsgjcap	0	*	That's the best description of monopoly I've ever heard!
t1_dsh7xb1	0	*	I like you
t1_dsh6mxd	0	*	So basically a bunch of Loons then!
t1_dsgpmb1	1	*	All he needs to start the world's largest dumpster fire is press his big red button, and he keeps bragging he will do it.
t1_dsh631q	1	*	Oh shit it is. I gotta start lunch! Thanks downvoters. Now the hubs won't come home to a tv dinner lmao.
t1_dsgrhtq	1	*	If a single can of beans is worth the *both* of you potentially dying over, it isn't enough to save you from staving.
t1_dsgonqr	1	*	Periodically shredded comment.
t1_dsg9cyc	1	*	Best of luck to us all.
t1_dsgkvlj	1	*	He resigned because of watergategate. I think you know this.
t1_dsgrhcj	0	*	As it was for Obama.  And, at the end of the day, he wagged his tail to same people Trump does.
t1_dsi1dge	1	*	The instructions for Monopoly were almost certainly written by someone who never had to explain them to a real human being in their life.
t1_dsiccps	1	*	I think the thing which creates those weaknesses is the illness-- the identity itself. But that's just me thinking
t1_dsinu93	1	*	I think Jesus promoted such a radical change to human nature that it doesn't fit into either camp.
t1_dsh3s3e	0	*	Yeah and the crimes linked to Trump are...?  I mean, if theyve got him, why isnt he impeached yet
t1_dshfsoo	0	*	Insults and no facts. How very liberal of you.
t1_dshtx1c	1	*	> IQ: Not an accurate measure intelligence  Conversation over.  We live in two different worlds  Have fun in your fantasy world.

t1_dshcicu	1	*	No arguments though. You cant argue against facts. :-)
t1_dsgpn3l	1	*	You have more patience than I'll ever have.
t1_dshtbth	1	*	Not everyone is an elected representative are they?
t1_ducxuie	1	*	Yeah, but they haven't encouraged it.
t1_dse83t5	0	*	Nuclear tests are not having nuclear weapons......even if they have a successful test what are they going to do, throw it at us?

t1_dsegf5r	1	*	Will you pay to house the millions of korean refugees and repair the devastated Korean cities afterwards? You have a very simplistic view of geopolitics.
t1_dseyl6g	0	*	You're a Trump worshiper. That's pretty much the definition of the word asshole. 
t1_dsee038	1	*	Prostitution more like sex slavery:
t1_dsece4p	1	*	Even a nuke bomb needs to be small enough to fit in a plane, so you have to not only figure out how it works but make it small enough to be mobile. 
t1_duldgcq	0	*	That is so wrong, those few are growing up and making the world functional. It would be madness not to educate them. Listen to yourself! 
t1_dum8uvl	1	*	Oh gotcha. Yeah, I can totes see 5% for that kind of latter response.
t1_dsf9h96	1	*	Oh you're scared of getting beheaded, fair enough. Sit in your home I guess.
t1_dv3l5fx	0	*	TIL, the British won the American Revolution, because USA didn't exist until after the war was won.
t1_dv2gwf1	1	*	Peace In Our Timeis possible because now we stand a chance to prepare.   100% agree.

t1_dv26bxu	1	*	Shut up nerd. :D 
t1_dv25ke8	0	*	My point is just that looking out for the US first isn't as unreasonable in itself as people make it out to be.

t1_dst8exv	1	*	Calm down mate, what's your problem?

t1_dsbzdt6	0	*	Obama did not do enough, but he did at least get us into the Paris agreement. 
t1_dswv2pf	0	*	I intrerpreted the data as 26 men and 18 women were excluded from the games, while in those sports 111 people in total was participating. 26 + 18 don't equal 111 so the sheet is a bit confusing.

t1_dshb2is	0	*	The one where Hillary Clinton's campaign took over the DNC in 2015 long before the primaries began.    You're being obtuse.  
t1_dse3nl3	1	*	If we want that then we need to have open and honest primaries, no party should be able to claim that they can go into the back room and choose the candidate without the will of the people 
t1_dsdpuzh	1	*	Maybe the concrete wall that Mexico was going to pay for? Was that the ~~lie~~ promise that got him elected?

t1_dsfam37	0	*	Troll on brother.
t1_dse9yl6	0	*	Thats the .01%  The 1% is somewhere below half a million per year income. I think like 350,000 for an individual.  Even the .01% has something like 15,000 families or people (cant remember off hand).

t1_dshie2v	1	*	Was the first podcast I listened to by them and it hooked me. Great show!  If you like More Perfect, Stay Tuned with Preet Bharara is another excellent podcast that's law focused.

t1_dshvroa	1	*	Yep, because politicians never break the law...
t1_dsedh6p	0	*	Nah, it's crony capitalism. I know a few people totally into the Free Market Jesus idea who still hate that, because it's corporations in bed with politicians. And it's dirty in all of the unfun ways.
t1_dsdr90x	1	*	Sanders won my whole state, but my state is Oklahoma so it was a bittersweet victory.

t1_dsdru7w	1	*	> You either have to be an incredibly stupid person or intentionally disingenuous.  ..or perhaps you simply cannot read?
t1_dset82l	1	*	Hmm... so maybe they just don't want us to forget so that when they inevitably do a 180 on Trump they can just say, I never really supported him anyway?  Yeah, probably.
t1_dse3nlj	0	*	Its so insanely corrupt
t1_dse2r5v	1	*	I think some people on Reddit were not taught the importance of citation or that wikipedia itself (not the direct sources at the bottom) is unacceptable.
t1_dsdy635	1	*	That's right out of the rural christian playbook.  I don't have advantages = I'm being repressed
t1_dsdohq6	1	*	Seriously one of my top 10 songs of all time.
t1_dsf6rg2	1	*	ok
t1_dsfxxmp	1	*	So let me ask then, what are we to do?
t1_dsea3zr	1	*	Why are you bringing up russians and Trump? I already said both parties are corrupted as fuck and i dislike both of them. Jesus can you get that through your thick skull?
t1_dt2lpgs	0	*	Do you think Scientologists deserve to be tortured?
t1_dt4ncv6	0	*	No, I cut you off at the pass. I know where your bogus argument leads, and now you can go sit in the corner. 
t1_dt2i07p	1	*	Holy shit you just dropped a brainbomb on him
t1_dt3poxo	1	*	Sure, let's get rid of that system.  I'm sure millions of farmers moving into the city without jobs or housing will work out just fine, like it does in India.
t1_dt2gogo	0	*	Hope you're ready for when commies overtake your country as world leader :)
t1_dt2w2kx	1	*	Said the wanna be American?
t1_dt3qgwu	0	*	Then you get a bunch of articles about ghost cities and those crazy Chinamen! 
t1_dt3slqm	1	*	Ah yes, whataboutism.  The old I'm just going to pretend hypocrisy isn't a thing argument.   Very effective when you want to shit on someone but you're already covered in shit yourself.
t1_dt3ky8w	1	*	Also, they have a immigrant ranking system as well. This also determines of you are allowed to live there or not. The city you reside in also plays into your immigrant class. 
t1_dt5h3qw	0	*	Yes there is, it's called Singapore, another Chinese dominated nation and the inspiration of PRC's reform in the 80s. Don't jump to conclusion too quickly because of your ignorance
t1_dt39f6d	1	*	well the US is a nation born out of colonialism and slavery. history teaches might makes right
t1_dt2pibb	1	*	I can't run, I wasn't born in the states. Where are you from anyway?
t1_dt35piw	0	*	So you admit you decided to go on an off-topic tangent.  Sit down and stare at the corner.
t1_dt2zwpr	1	*	You seem pretty jelly bud. U ok?
t1_dt3nmvj	0	*	I'm not entirely sure that makes sense. How would Britain tag along while you invade Britain?
t1_dt2ohlk	0	*	Education funding, gradual cultural shift towards western ideals for everyone, not just university educated elite, and time. 
t1_dt2mfpg	0	*	Why not? Trump is as antiestablishment as they come.
t1_dtxtw5z	1	*	Lmao we got jokes I see.
t1_dunpl7x	0	*	Wait but don't you live in Africa?  And why did you put quotation marks on Africa?
t1_dtdiaml	1	*	Bit like when Dr Strange had someone use a defibrillator on him, so his spirit could kill another spirit?
t1_dtevxg2	1	*	Absolutely pathetic.
t1_dtdeq8o	1	*	> What kind of demented idiocy is this?  It's called politics.
t1_dtdwhxe	0	*	Theocracies are even more despotic 
t1_dtdirin	0	*	And it's already banned. Sorry. Putin wants movies to shit out rainbow and glitter to make his tyrannical ways okay if it's about him
t1_dtdn1we	1	*	The Tories don't need agents, they have supporters in high places anyway.  Honestly America and Russia are as bad as each other. Both are trying to manipulate everyone. 
t1_dtdka5f	0	*	Yeeeaahhh.....your understanding on the US's impact on the world politically and economically needs some some depth if you think it would be a more peaceful planet without us. Proposal rejected lol
t1_dtdtm30	1	*	For example, your salt on my comment which you didn't respond to because you got owned. 
t1_dtdl19i	0	*	Eternal life sounds exhausting. I'm good. 
t1_dtdsxxx	1	*	All of this true, mindless American patriotism trumps facts though.
t1_dtdo6a6	1	*	Yes.
t1_dtdk69i	1	*	<3
t1_dtfbn6k	1	*	Thank you! That truly means a lot to me. 
t1_dtdwg2i	1	*	Aight. 
t1_dtdhhcq	1	*	Shit you better hurry. Im deadass convinced new movie ideas now come from writers browsing other peoples ideas online.  ***SOMEONE GET THIS DUDE A CAMERA***
t1_dtdio8g	0	*	> Both parties are near identical  Wew lad  As to the rest of it, yes we have some shit people who democratically vote for shit things. Democracy doesn't mean nothing bad ever happens.
t1_dtdeqvf	0	*	I misread your comment after seeing a bunch of comparisons here. My apologies!
t1_dtdmc3p	0	*	They got a bunch of sanctions from the rest of the world and it's screwed their economy pretty hard. 
t1_dtdhedt	0	*	Where does that dead spirit go?   Well maybe they're born back in earth as grandson of Putin who's gonna usurpe him.
t1_dtdnkgj	1	*	Sure. 
t1_dtdd5jg	1	*	The most likely answer, Occum's Razor and all that.
t1_dtdgdi9	1	*	Kijiji board?
t1_dtdwi5b	1	*	Yeh. 
t1_dtexjji	1	*	>go awat
t1_dtdsonh	1	*	Putin is Tsarina Catherine?
t1_dtdnw5i	1	*	Then everything changed, when the fire nation attacked. 
t1_dsdh1lf	0	*	Oh man you are a Trump Voter! Playing the victim, everyone is the real racist!  You have it down pat.
t1_dsaz4ng	0	*	I dont travel for business I travel for pleasure and visiting family. But I go every year for nearly 2 months so Its not like I don't know what I am talking about. 
t1_dsbdvf6	0	*	So because you personally don't find the content interesting you think it's shite and the people producing it, making tens of thousands of people happy with it, are arseholes? Says a lot about you.
t1_dsavw7f	0	*	He's not making a strawman, he is poking holes in your logic. You said that per capita emissions doesn't matter. He's explaining in a clear example why it DOES matter.
t1_ds3gkw3	1	*	Stop feeding the troll. He's just fucking with you.
t1_ds3dtbq	1	*	He's a troll dude. 
t1_ds43nnv	1	*	Can we make saying divide by oil a thing? Im gonna make it a thing.
t1_ds3cfm1	1	*	Y'all bit that troll bait pretty damn hard
t1_ds3fnpo	1	*	Yeah idk how people didnt immediately understand this guy is trolling or joking lol.
t1_dtu53h4	0	*	Pretty sure the government ordered the Holocaust, not a private company trying  to cut costs.
t1_dug6c7o	0	*	People will never do this of their own initiative, the vast majority of people hate dealing with computers in any way. It needs to come from the top.
t1_dufhowk	0	*	Jesus Christ, you're actually proving his point but are too stupid to realize it  put down the paint chips and go back to class little boy. 
t1_dufl9yw	0	*	If you are posting on td there is no bridging the gap. Youre a crazy person or a troll or both. 
t1_dug51c5	1	*	Might be a business opportunity there...
t1_duhb66y	1	*	I think you better shut up with your self righteous nonsense. No one needs opinions from a man who thinks most Americans should be shot because they are against child molestors/rapists.
t1_duf9s85	0	*	He said, as a T_D poster, without a hint of irony or self-awareness. Hey how many times was @Ten_GOP posted in your pit? 
t1_duf6dz0	0	*	Solid comment.
t1_dufa570	1	*	https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/7y979i/reddits_the_donald_was_one_of_the_biggest_havens/duetog8/
t1_dufp5h9	0	*	If conservatives don't want the divide to stay this way they should try bridging the gap and compromising. Instead all they do is bitch about liberals and spit on them.
t1_dufdfs8	0	*	If Im understanding correctly, you think that divesting somehow removed the influence of a billion dollar investment?
t1_dugl722	1	*	That's not specific at all. What legislation / policy?  I take it you hate the Germans for shutting down nuclear and replacing it with coal?
t1_dufcne2	0	*	I would suggest you read the entire article, how can you take one part of an article and reach an opinion? 
t1_duf98ll	0	*	.. assuming you're a Trump supporter.  <--- You dropped this. And that's the most important part.
t1_dufmfwk	0	*	>It's literally copy/paste one line of code and change one setting on your router.    May you provide a link, then? I'm interested.
t1_duh3gtv	1	*	You're a perfect example of what I mean. 
t1_dufw5wh	1	*	You honestly think there are a lot of cum box stories being posted on Facebook?
t1_dugmdnp	1	*	Yeah typical. Dude Im a conservative. I do it all the time. I just make my non ludicrous point a little better and without being an ass.
t1_duf6pk5	1	*	I dont know why I expected you to actually give a thoughtful response...   That was my bad.
t1_dufa6k5	1	*	Yes
t1_dsu99mt	1	*	MY man....
t1_dstm1vd	0	*	I got turned off of Disco by the third episode. I'll give it another try when full season becomes available.
t1_dsvj40w	0	*	Sure, that flag is good, but post that to the sub and they'll say it's shit because it can't be recreated by written measurements
t1_dtc9fzw	1	*	Got to make crime to solve crime.
t1_dstsr71	1	*	I don't think he ever said the people don't want reunification. He just thinks they want reunification under his leadership.
t1_dsudst0	0	*	Also Q
t1_dsu2wsb	1	*	> DS9 has the best genre depiction of developing conflicts, large scale wars and shifting alliances.  Never watched Babylon 5 I see.
t1_dstrax1	1	*	The story has no actual facts about anything Trump did though.
t1_dsttj1n	0	*	TIL I know basically nothing about Korean history beyond modern NK/SK conflict.  Gonna google stuff.
t1_dsuwpox	1	*	I always like it when two sides are arguing and someone tries to attack a side by saying some dumb shit and both temporarily align to call that person an idiot
t1_dsu3t1q	1	*	JANEWAY MURDERED TUVIX!  STARFLEETINFOWARS DOT COM.
t1_dstqrsf	1	*	Make every country except N/S Korea form one mega team, they'll have to work together
t1_dstv36w	0	*	I feel sorry for the people who you manage to fool with your neutral politics bullshit.  Even a cursory look at your submissions shows you for the T_D troll that you are.
t1_dstpsff	0	*	You recognize that war will result in tens of millions of more deaths than those death camps produce and possibly nuclear winter, right?   
t1_dsv9t13	1	*	Probably lol.
t1_dstp5f5	1	*	Written like a true American!
t1_dsu7l43	1	*	Are you kidding? The Japanese flag is one of the best national flags..
t1_dstn7gd	0	*	It's text, hard to read if there is sarcasm or not. Excuse me for  that, I am unnecessarily sensible it seems right now. I hate argueing with Americans...
t1_dstpc1s	1	*	Our food is good and we serve way too much at most meals lol
t1_dstvgad	0	*	The American flag would like a word....
t1_dstxu1o	1	*	wow he's right. Look at the Lofa counties flag..
t1_dstp3st	1	*	I liked it a lot. I think the hate is way overblown.
t1_dsttfc6	0	*	I'm (*mostly*) of Saxon or Jute extraction. That doesn't make me German-British. Norwegian-Americans aren't any more Norwegian than I'm German. Neither are Italian-Americans.
t1_dsudjkf	0	*	Yeah just like any currency, you do extensive research before using it  Oh wait
t1_dstq2d5	1	*	Taking a ~60 second glance through that persons comment history, he or she is probably on the spectrum, and I say that completely seriously without intent to be insulting. 
t1_dstpmd1	0	*	I can make a flat outline of my balls a flag too, does that make it good?
t1_dsttfxh	1	*	So no change from decades of policy with North Korea, and the South giving credit to a known egoist without any action from Trump. Not great evidence Im afraid.
t1_dstqpej	1	*	Who do you Mourn for?
t1_dsu8yni	1	*	And there is a cool Kamehameha vs Gallet gun episode near the very end! (Kira and Jake if you forgot the scene)

t1_dsu2j4s	1	*	/r/restofthefuckingflag
t1_dstujng	0	*	Strongly disagree.
t1_dstrkzr	1	*	No joke.    When somebody tells me about some awesome new pizza joint they found, I have to first ask them what they think of Papa Johns before I'll even bother considering trying it.   
t1_dsu73ts	0	*	Plasma and sharding are for Ethereum, not Bitcoin.
t1_dstyxn4	1	*	there was an interview where they said people weren't getting that Dukat was evil which is why he basically went insane at the end

t1_dsu55i6	1	*	Render toxa0Caesar the things that you would have him render untoxa0you.
t1_dstqi5n	0	*	How can you not mention the Dominion in that list. They felt like the first antagonists in Star Trek that weren't paper thin. The Borg are rad as hell but they're pretty one dimensional.
t1_dsu3ohh	0	*	i like opinions
t1_dstz7hd	1	*	50 States is such a nice, even number, too. 
t1_dstr7q8	1	*	Step 1) Draw an oval    Step 2) [Draw the rest of the fucking Korean peninsula](https://www.reddit.com/r/restofthefuckingowl/)
t1_dstrsdh	1	*	>He almost literally wound up in hell, though. That's some next-level justice.  Well Bajoran hell, so that's next-level hell for a Cardassian.
t1_dsufeit	1	*	Write it in comic sans and weve got a deal
t1_dsudq62	0	*	Modernizing North Korea doesn't really sound like much of a burden... instead it sounds insanely profitable.
t1_dsu38or	0	*	Because Christians only accept the parts of the bible that agree with their personal opinions.
t1_dsu8ibd	1	*	I really liked being a kid and watching DS9 and Babylon 5 and pretending that they would cross over sometime.
t1_dsul6ax	1	*	Well, it was the US, China, and Japan (before them) that fucked it up. Korea would never be divided if not for colonialism and the Cold War.
t1_dsu2jmj	1	*	I agree. If a kid tried to draw that it'd end up looking like a... well... ahem....
t1_dstrqsz	1	*	Over Picard? Get outta my face with that shit.  inb4 hur dur he punched Q in the face
t1_dsuc5l7	0	*	Economically Right but socially Left?

t1_dstontl	0	*	Just know that the guy who replied to you and is encouraging you to buy definitely owns some himself. He is biased and has a direct benefit to encouraging you to buy.
t1_dsuf4iv	1	*	Understanding the underlying technology behind any given crypto currency and understanding economic trends and cryptocurrencies' evolving role are two completely different things.
t1_dsttd4g	1	*	Valen best captain.
t1_dstpui6	0	*	Those other 10% though... those are the food of gods
t1_dstwynk	1	*	True of most countries at war.
t1_dstpzvk	1	*	Straight up. Sisko gets shit done.
t1_dsuz8o9	1	*	Hmm. I wonder why..
t1_dsuhznt	1	*	I disagree. Gimme a white cloth and some blue paint, i could sneeze that flag into existence.  
t1_dstnaql	0	*	The context is one comment above mine, not my own comment. Is that so hard...?  I react to this: > I've lived my whole life in NY and NJ so I know pizza; trust me when I say it's damn good pizza, 
t1_dsupj3s	1	*	Duly noted.
t1_dsv6nmo	1	*	Yes, I think you were confused in your first comment, and I was trying to help correct that confusion.
t1_dstx1iy	1	*	Cyprus's flag is equally bad though.
t1_dsts621	0	*	I am still confused but thanks.
t1_dstx8mj	1	*	All of human history in a nutshell.
t1_dsuxt7v	1	*	Noted
t1_dsu5v0q	1	*	With relative sizes too?
t1_dstvd93	0	*	Inner Light. Easy. If you had put up Inner Light and Sarek it'd've been more difficult but I think Inner Light would still have won out.
t1_dstreh8	1	*	Haters gonna hate
t1_dstv5h8	0	*	I like to use Picard and Sisko first meeting Q to sum up the differences between them, Picard goes to court and defends humanity, Sisko punches him in the face.
t1_dsvptvb	1	*	242 years old. My birthday is November 10th, 1775. Tun Tavern, Philadelphia PA.
t1_dsu5v6l	1	*	And don't be afraid of reading them - most of those whitepapers are easy to understand if you put enough time in it, so you can make your own conclusions.
t1_dsu0f2d	1	*	Yeah the biggest flaw of DS9's last season was the flanderisation of Dukat, so he'd be more comically evil for the audience to digest at the end,
t1_dsucpqo	1	*	Ww1 propaganda. Anti German sentiment in america was HIGH during that time period. It's when a man named Friedrich Johann would name his child Stan
t1_dsu81pi	0	*	I'm not sure where you live, but in much of Mainland Europe,  as long as you're not a known criminal,  people don't care what border you cross. 
t1_dstt4tq	1	*	Thanks for your input!
t1_dstspt1	0	*	The Podesta Group filed foreign agent registrations last year, going back decades, since they hadn't filed them.  John Podesta worked for Hillary, is she a Russian Puppet as well?
t1_dstta0o	1	*	Yeah, thats what I was pointing out - Im glad to see others see it the way I do.
t1_dsuslv4	1	*	I heard that guy had like, 30 goddamn dicks
t1_dsua4wz	1	*	We'd probably get very confused, very often...
t1_dsu2yqc	0	*	It was a joke. I was talking about the puritans when I said religious zealot, you know, the people who risked certain death because they thought Catholics partied too hard. 
t1_dstr2vq	0	*	Or alternatively, Fake Korea only won every event because they were teamed up with Best Korea
t1_dsu7sia	0	*	Dude I live in Wales. I draw some shitty dragons too.
t1_dstt5r8	1	*	I find Babylon 5 to be at least a little better. 
t1_dstz3wd	1	*	Flag quizzes on the other hand...

t1_dsu38yp	1	*	ich danke dir fxfcr deine meinung, war klar das du bayer bist.
t1_dststh1	0	*	Yeah, I say we get away from dynasties. Look for my name on the ballot in 2040 or 2044, it will be the very German last name. I already have 2 people pledged to vote for me, make it a third.

t1_dstsqdq	1	*	If projections are correct, the cultures should discover fire in about five weeks.
t1_dstuns9	0	*	It's the *ruler*. Both Koreas want it, but one is a dictatorship and it's unreasonable to suggest that a dictatorship is equal to a democracy in deciding what both Koreas want. 
t1_duchk69	1	*	Well, if you don't negligently let a kid get that close to the trigger, then they type of gun is irrelevant.
t1_dt6ihe7	0	*	Everyone has the right to be wrong.
t1_du0xdii	1	*	96% think Muslims didn't do it, 4% accept that they did.  Reading comprehension.

t1_du1pcrs	1	*	Relatively, it's a few compared to many. My point stands
t1_du0mixq	0	*	If they wanted to go into the countries, they could have. Pretty sure Iraqi leader was doing crazy shit before 2001 happened.
t1_dsrgooy	1	*	I got tornadoes.  I can't even compete with hurricanes.   Y'all win. 
t1_dsrow0v	1	*	Oh it has here as well. This is probably the most fucked up winter I can remember weather wise.
t1_dsr4rl5	1	*	All of them are reworking their current cheats to work on the next tests. 
t1_dsr81ky	0	*	It's literally plugging in a device and pushing a button, for many users. It's like changing your password, level difficult, not replacing a circuit board, difficult. 
t1_dsr6kpk	0	*	Lol good luck.

t1_dsr401z	1	*	Ford just got busted doing the same thing. 
t1_dsr3kdt	0	*	We either have to allocate funds to handle the increased load on our recycling systems or divert recyclable materials to landfills. Thats all that is saying. 
t1_dss0yxo	0	*	Per capita works for something like garbage in a landfill, not air pollution which is what this article is about. And now you're just downvoting because you disagree?
t1_dsr5j9m	0	*	There are quite a few programs for low income individuals that want to retire an older car. I think they offer up to $9500 (cash, not a tax credit)

t1_dthw5yp	1	*	Not if you don't want your companies secrets belonging to foreign intelligence and being routed to their equivalent r&d&intercepts
t1_dth1rzg	0	*	How so? The Chinese government has a long history of stealing information from American companies and giving it to Chinese companies. I wouldn't want my personal or work data shared with them. 
t1_dsmp5aa	1	*	Sorry I wasn't able to support your biased worldview. I'll try harder next time 
t1_dslnphe	0	*	if that's your view then the US has multiple mass shootings every day in our worst inner cities.
t1_dsmgvjh	1	*	when you only have to pay people $1/hr then yeah it's pretty good business.  
t1_dsn7tbl	0	*	yes it is in the USA and still has a significantly higher murder rate than the US as a whole. and your response to me tells me you absolutely don't know what murder rate means
t1_dtupip1	0	*	Governments. We have all sorts of rules around this kind of thing.

t1_dtvh276	0	*	It's funny how you use a quotation with probably little to no understanding to what surrounds it.
t1_dtuoz7j	0	*	It's funny how rightists only care about women's rights when it's used as an excuse to hate on muslims.
t1_dtuh4rs	1	*	okay, but that's another dimension beyond it simply being something for women. shouldn't oversimplify sexism.
t1_duz18q8	1	*	Companies are always going to be companies. Its up to doctors and people to balance things. 
t1_duy8e6n	0	*	Love the economist, its heavily biased twords rightwing economic social theory.
t1_duxd25y	1	*	Preach. 
t1_duxqybn	0	*	well, prohibition never worked and more lax regulation (like in Portugal) brought a positive outcome. So why not try to make them even more relaxed and see how it goes?
t1_du4i72v	1	*	We are not really saying different things here. UTC is a time standard, UTCxb100:00 is a time zone.

t1_du68m4t	0	*	Did I even mentioned about school hours not changing? Stop changing the topic.
t1_du4go69	0	*	My point is that DST is not required when you can just adopt a different time zone. The whole point is that DST is unnecessary. 
t1_dt83m71	1	*	The science is lost on you. Don't bother
t1_dt818g7	1	*	You are the one making assumptions. In the scenario I posited there is no twin or clone. If you replaced yourself with an exact replica right now, it would go on being you is the point I was making. 
t1_dtmogw7	1	*	Mm...no
t1_dtmgc5s	0	*	I smelled it.   Heard him fart.  Am I suppose to assume he just wants attention, or feels bad cause he lost?

t1_du9i57g	1	*	>Although I will concede that East of Houston is... Yeah...   Can confirm. Been working in Port Arthur and Beaumont this week..

t1_dufvn7a	1	*	I feel so bad for the others that England is screwing them over. I live in England but I do think it's unfair how much over-reprrsentation we get.
t1_dug558a	1	*	Unless you bullshit your way by missleading information. 
t1_dtqqurv	0	*	Except Western families have 1-2 kids meaning they have the footprint of 3-6 kids which is less than the 8-10 kids in India or Uganda

t1_dtqulin	1	*	I guess by especially I just meant that trash in particular can be acutely harmful. So not in quantity but in potency.
t1_dtsrh1z	0	*	The cook study is the most referenced one and its methodology has a clear, ridiculously transparent bias. 
t1_du065bn	0	*	Read back my comments, don't put words in my mouth. 
t1_dtzk2ax	0	*	 If you're going to make things up, you might as well make it more convincing than, it's not nutritious. You're talking to mostly Americans, they don't care about nutrition.

t1_dsmb97y	0	*	What the fuck are you even arguing at this point
t1_dslgz5c	0	*	UNECE in 2015 says that the average American salary is $4,893 whilst Norway is at $5,418, so my point still stands.

t1_duusbk9	0	*	Just take this sentence and apply it to the idea of a flat earth. 
t1_duv6gpu	1	*	> It's RIFE in rural areas   It's rife *everywhere*. It's just in rural areas people say it out loud instead of under their breath when they're alone in their car in traffic.

t1_duv1474	0	*	Yes.  Every organ.  Every cell.  
t1_duuhb7r	1	*	I thought so. Poor fella
t1_duui5p0	0	*	It makes me sad that trolling is this now. Trolling used to be elever ways to mess and prank people. Now it's just people spouting awful shit. 
t1_duwgts5	1	*	Do I expect prices to go up MORE or LESS than they did over the past 8 years?
t1_duv3c96	1	*	Thirteen you say? I'd halve that and that would still be giving him the benefit of the doubt!
t1_duv1f3g	1	*	Nope Reddit already decided he was a junkie.  I have been prescribed opiates. On at least 3 occasions.  I can't even remember the last time i took one.

t1_duv26g1	1	*	probably a solid idea not to go back to east berlin or nazi germany days
t1_dsc48x7	0	*	Thats just the thing, the taxes will be going down.  It takes more than a day for taxes to be cut, and its hard for him to pass the tax cut when democrats wont work with him. 
t1_ds1an39	0	*	So then you should probably get a bank account
t1_ds64ytr	1	*	This ex-fucking-xactly. Libertarians despise the guy's business practices. 
t1_ds61im3	1	*	If Tesla had a waiting list for a hover car, I'd sit on it forever, and even if I got to fly it one day before i died of old age- it'd still be worth it.
t1_ds63nl8	0	*	Maybe in most cases but not all.  Kia makes some damn fine cars yet we all still want a benz
t1_ds66hop	0	*	Why do you think he's a twat? I've never  heard anything really bad about him
t1_ds6jnvm	1	*	I think I'll stick to believing [what the dictionaries say](https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/misuse-of-literally) rather than what u/Kekmonster's opinion is. 
t1_ds67qim	1	*	As if there's a time *not* to be drinking whiskey.  While, maybe in court while discussing whiskey related offenses...

t1_ds636t3	0	*	Would you expect Volvo to release an affordable electric vehicle before Tesla works out the issues with model 3 production?
t1_ds6p1ya	0	*	The problem isn't people not being able to take a joke. It's that your joke wasn't funny...
t1_ds65m2s	1	*	if that's the case then he should buy chargepoint

t1_ds6i5xz	1	*	Til. Thanks!
t1_ds63zbe	1	*	Well he's not saying people will stop being desperate and using it, he's saying they'll run out of victims. Which they will, eventually
t1_ds5xiwm	1	*	Have you seen the model 3 in real life? It's pretty ugly. The regular tesla looks good but the model three aint a beauty.
t1_ds65yqt	1	*	Tesla doesn't have 1 self driving car. So to me it sounds like they're playing catchup to google.
t1_ds67ywi	1	*	I actually drove a 2016 Model S my former boss bought. IIRC one of the first in Aus.   There has been wide spread acknowledgement of build quality issues. To deny that is misleading.
t1_ds60gmm	1	*	All three automakers paid back the bailout back *with* interest
t1_ds65v7g	0	*	I'm pretty sure /u/Cilph is joking.

t1_dt8q1b9	0	*	Is this reddit's new favorite phrase/word they've learned like 'whataboutism' has been for the last year?  I've seen it everywhere lately.  
t1_dt8g3ii	1	*	What? There's a huge amount of military bases in Japan.
t1_dtarw8o	0	*	> SCMP  Heh. An Alibaba newspaper? 
t1_dt8e4ee	1	*	what the hell does 'rant' mean? 
t1_dt8cf3p	1	*	Well shiiiiiiit, wasn't into Family Guy all that much... it's a good show though.
t1_dt88ooe	1	*	That's true as well. I assume they'd wanna know the state of what they have, if they don''t already, before agreeing to any major reunification deals though.
t1_dt8dwhw	1	*	Technology-wise, there's nothing stopping the south from building far-superior nuclear weapons. Any weapons gained would be obsolete.
t1_dt9urjl	0	*	Why not both?  I believe they are doing an audit right now.
t1_dt83x9x	1	*	Or biding time till they minimize their nukes? Who knows, it's hard to get into the head of a murderous dictate. But one thing for certain, he isn't doing this because out if the better if his heart.
t1_dsxz7s6	0	*	:eyeroll:  /leaves
t1_dtxtsr4	1	*	It's not like it has to be one or the other. I would say it's both really 
t1_dtxmn1d	1	*	I didn't have to try.  Dude's talking about globalist conspiracy theories.  A methed out juggalo would be better than him and would no doubt make for a more worth while conversation.  
t1_dtxobon	1	*	As if that is a challenge. 
t1_dtxov2r	0	*	Sorry I wasted my time. I thought you interested in a real conversation.
t1_dtzg39c	0	*	lol
t1_dtyfmqn	0	*	You're the one that doesn't understand the extent of corruption of your system, and the fact that the system is designed so that the corruption can exist. 
t1_dtxxa6v	1	*	> They support Hamas  Oh yeah we love them can't get enough of them!
t1_dsay9vy	0	*	This place is fairly neutral, if not slightly to the left. You're basically saying that you have to be in a communist safe space to actually debate the topic.  
t1_dsb5cn7	1	*	Yep, the no true Scotsman fallicy is so common among them that it has actually become a meme.
t1_dsbsio3	1	*	Ohh in that case the oil companies in Venezuela.
t1_dtakdcg	0	*	But doesn't hurt any argument that most politicians are incompetent, which is true.
t1_dv4qqi9	1	*	I can understand that people won't believe YPG is a terror organisation, but saying PKK is not a terror organisation is like saying ISIS isn't.
t1_dsabsto	0	*	Wrong, he has fights ongoing with Canada, Egypt, Australia, New Zealand, Belgium. 
t1_dty6dtk	0	*	Looks like military hardware to me.
t1_dtygc8b	0	*	Analogies aren't 'bullshit' either.

t1_duwq5w4	1	*	Firing an employee for joining a union is illegal here in NY as well.
t1_duxnqtr	1	*	They're homeless aren't in the millions. Who cares about stocks if half your country is in jail or getting shot up in schools
t1_dv2ky20	1	*	Though I'm not up on specifics as you are I tend to agree. I'm still pissed about the electoral reform 180 and am planning on voting for either of the 2 to punish that lie.
t1_duxt63d	1	*	> It's the same topic  No, it isn't.
t1_du6rhqe	0	*	Yes. Murdering, exploiting and treating them like cattle. So generous.
t1_dsp02e1	0	*	They are different groups. Different leaders, different areas of the middle east, etc. However, they have similar goals.
t1_duv37es	1	*	So that puts you at about 2.5lb each per month, while I drink 3lb in two, or 1.5lb/month. Not a huge difference, all things considered.
t1_duzdaoa	0	*	If it's light sweet crude yes, but [different grades are worth different amounts per barrel](https://oilprice.com/).
t1_duzhiuo	1	*	Yes.
t1_duzjxxs	0	*	You tend to believe anything that shows Mexico or Latinos in a shitty light. Yeah I'd say youve been gas lighted by the Republican party and are too stupid to notice. 
t1_duze2ey	0	*	 > >I work in the oil industry, so i read A LOT or articles daily. It starts to turn into a mush of price manipulation.   Same here. I hope America keeps producing though. 
t1_duzdz9y	1	*	That and to eventually link the crimean pipeline to haliburtons pipeline that runs from the caspian to the arbian sea.  
t1_duzbft6	0	*	I hope that's sarcasm, because clean coal is essentially a myth.
t1_dv0irue	1	*	To shreds you say...
t1_duzbvxk	0	*	Doesn't mean we should produce more to fight this stupid fake war with Russia at the expense of the environment. 
t1_duzqloe	1	*	So, a locomotive?
t1_duzf1g2	0	*	Except that is not true. The Saudis can drop down the price much more easily than the US because they can afford to sell their oil far more cheaply due to low lifting costs.
t1_duzg12y	1	*	No. Not at all buddy. 
t1_duzdcqm	1	*	Venezuelas collapse is also increasing oil price since their output is going down very quickly
t1_duzlf8l	1	*	Coal oil
t1_duzk76i	1	*	Sure, but that doesn't mean they're not happening. 
t1_duzapt4	1	*	Isnt that just a train?
t1_duzcr23	1	*	Definitely and not only that they have gained a big foothold in the Black Sea as well.
t1_duze09g	1	*	If you're in the industry you should remember what happened to the market in 2015 when Iran briefly entered the market and the price of oil tanked.
t1_duzah0u	0	*	At some point it won't matter. The price of shale oil keeps going down as economies of scale are applied.
t1_duzuxke	1	*	Only one previous owner, only drove them to church on sundays.
t1_duzk52u	1	*	See my other reply but this is just not true at all. 
t1_duzw00k	1	*	The Deepwater Horizon at that!
t1_duztxxb	1	*	NO! Sweet light crude is the premier variety. Other kinds like sour crude are less desirable and sell for less per bbl.
t1_duza3kb	0	*	Or ya know, invest in solar and other renewable energies.
t1_duzdscx	0	*	> at the price of extreme environmental damage.  
t1_duzg5r6	1	*	The reason Saudi Arabia is important is because their oil is all produced onshore and doesn't require any special equipment to extract.
t1_dv01az7	1	*	Whatever, dude. You called me a troll on another thread. You have zero credibility 
t1_duzgfy8	1	*	Choochoo!

t1_ds9v5vn	1	*	but you're from the uk with your boarder basicly being a giant coast. :D 
t1_ds9qe6t	1	*	Yep see this is why I got a bad grade in gov class in college I'll edit my post. 
t1_ds9mskf	0	*	Depends on how hard it is to implement. China's working on it right now. 
t1_ds9ox4v	0	*	Theres probably an app for that
t1_dsa8hbq	0	*	Morality isn't objective...youre not America's moral authority
t1_ds9otos	0	*	Have won.
t1_dsa8fyy	0	*	Are you going to cry some more?
t1_ds9ougp	1	*	Yeah that happens every time I enter or exit the country.   Wait it's never happened to me before, probably because I don't illegally cross borders or give off the impression that I have.
t1_dsa8qpt	1	*	it is the kerbal way.
t1_dsabh8v	1	*	La La land. 
t1_ds9m69o	1	*	>if a guy looks terrroisty  mhm ill just let you figure out the issues that arise with that...
t1_dsbijvq	0	*	What would I know. I'm only ex forces. 
t1_ds9k9h8	0	*	The problem I have that is you punish unfairly innocent people who fit the profile in a way that is invisible to people who aren't profiled, and don't catch the guilty who don't fit the profile.
t1_ds9w2mt	0	*	If you say so bud.  I choose for my family to be homeless because I don't want this guy to know what porn I looked at.  No.
t1_ds9pkzu	1	*	> found a multitude of apps  such as? 
t1_ds9wmq5	1	*	Why would you laugh ? That's an aweful thing to wish for someone...
t1_ds9r9ob	1	*	Not when you have company confidential property for example when the risk is too great 
t1_ds9ppd8	0	*	your understanding is incorrect about how the constitution is or is not applied to non-citizens
t1_ds9vati	0	*	Yeah. Guantanamo is basically human livestock.
t1_ds9jdmi	1	*	Do agree, am from Michigan (basically means Im 1/2 Canadian), can understand sarcasm.
t1_ds9plxp	1	*	Plead guilty and was fined $500, he didn't fight it as promised.  http://www.cbc.ca/beta/news/canada/nova-scotia/alain-philippon-to-plead-guilty-cellphone-1.3721110
t1_ds9txbv	0	*	No. That isnt true. Everyone in the US is covered by the constitution and bill of rights. The dude youre replying to just (by his own admission) wasnt sure.
t1_dsae9fw	1	*	The Georgia Guidestones
t1_dsb2fx9	0	*	Maybe. But they would need an actual search warrant in order to force you to decrypt the drive (use full disk encryption always). Border control at the airport apparently doesn't need warrants.
t1_dsb28z9	1	*	See this I did not know. TIL
t1_ds9p00d	0	*	People do this shit casually on their phones. Probably while eating, driving, or looking at some art their kid just made.  And it is great interaction.  It ain't their senior thesis.
t1_ds9l45n	0	*	Got it. So should I not travel till I get my citizenship lol
t1_ds9mlq4	0	*	They fit right up in the butt easy
t1_ds9mwcr	0	*	The majority of kidnappings are done by relatives. Terrorists have more interest in just killing you outright.
t1_dsc8dju	1	*	I don't have the stats right now and am too lazy to Google them but in the Mexico border it's actually quite a lot (and even more that is missed) but in the Canadian border there's barely anything.
t1_ds9k55s	0	*	And this is where you loose your freedom, not gain security because on that line of thinking, eventually you will be a suspect.
t1_ds9m75n	1	*	Yeah, because Im sure the real terrorist is going to make sure he looks extra terroristy that day. 
t1_ds9wf5p	1	*	Why are the Bill of Rights and Constitutional protections a problem? You sound entitled. I have never thought for an instant that I am entitled to the same rights as a citizen of another nation.
t1_dsehq2p	0	*	j
t1_ds9strp	0	*	To be fair, we really don't want random tourists to be buying firearms.
t1_ds9uwtn	1	*	No, this thread is full of so much false shit.  Don't take anything you read here as fact. 
t1_dsa39p5	1	*	Thats kind of what I always just assumed. I figured they saw the US border agents be total dicks so they decided to emulate the same attitude. 
t1_ds9s48i	1	*	Lol, where do you hear this nonsense?
t1_dsa2n5u	0	*	Its exactly what you just did, you're bringing up voter rights because you don't have an argument. Nobody mentioned voter rights but you.
t1_ds9m136	1	*	TBH I think green card holders also have that right.
t1_dsab102	1	*	Ok, how about the revolutionaries in the American colonies that rose up against the British?  Or the revolutionaries in France? 
t1_ds9vbrm	1	*	Um... I think kristianstupid meant that if you piss em off they can detain for hours or deny your entry for whatever made up reason they want, specially if you are a foreign visitor.
t1_du49n7a	1	*	Remindme! 1 year

t1_du3tskg	1	*	Yes they worked.  Until the sheer size of economic activity meant having an economy limited in it's growth by some yellow rock was just dumb and slowing the growth of the economy.
t1_dundgd1	0	*	Of course, editorialized and spun news is fine as long as you agree with it.

t1_durej6i	0	*	OMFG, you're pulling this shit again?  Not everyone who disagrees with you has been brainwashed by Russian Twitter bots.
t1_duo7z2y	1	*	No I didn't unfortunately. Cameras being a bit frowned upon in certain areas. I did what they told me.
t1_dun1zvd	1	*	I agree with what you just said for sure. I think they may have tried for a civil war or serious secession movements.  But like you said, doesn't matter now.
t1_dun2lfb	0	*	What facts were they manipulating?
t1_dund8hn	0	*	Bathing only makes them multiply, doesn't make them evil, it's the eating after midnight that's the problem.  Maybe this is why they don't feed them in their Troll farms.

t1_dt8j1fp	1	*	The powder keg was entirely the fault of the UK and France. We kept the lid on it until 2003.  
t1_dt8eyhn	1	*	Yep, that happened. But for the US that's an abarent event, for China and RUssia its a pattern.

t1_dujveuo	0	*	Whats this secret society thing? And how secret and effective can it possibly be if some chump like *you* knows about it.
t1_duphvgp	1	*	I would really like an answer. 
t1_duk30no	1	*	It isn't pedantry if the wording fundamentally alters your meaning, dude.  Being snarky is also a sign of lacking the substance to engage, dontcha think?
t1_duktx0l	0	*	I never said you did, Ivan. How bizarre you went there.   But I guarantee you're not going to miss what I implied in my first sentence. Which will only prove me right about your motivations.
t1_dukkjkf	0	*	You stupid bitch. Trump is connected to Manafort. Manafort is connected to this van der whoever. By transitive properties, Trump is related to van der whoever. Now stop with bullshit.
t1_dukwg8w	1	*	I've given you the facts, if you can't draw the connection yourself it's because you don't want to.

t1_du1sixi	0	*	Hes pushing for religious freedom laws to protect LGBT discrimination. He tried to ban transgender citizens from serving in the military. These are not actions of someone who is pro-gay.
t1_du21heb	1	*	This isn't about Hitler and the Germans,  it's about Hitler and the Olympics, I'm attacking your leave political views when you come to the Olympics view. 
t1_du21e10	0	*	Nope. Homophobes are a majority while gays are 0.4%.  I also believe that'd be discrimination based on belief which is unconstitutional.

t1_du1u2dn	1	*	Im not retarded. I am just severely antisocial.
t1_du1ug46	1	*	What does America have to do with this? Should the US be responsible for every single countries international diplomatic relations? Seems like the opposite of other nations would want.
t1_du2gsql	0	*	To be fair I don't think he was describing an assault although the term grope is generally used to describe such.  Consensual or not, sexual activity in public is deviant though

t1_duakc36	0	*	What lie?
t1_du7hxks	1	*	It was clearly a breach of rights in the context of cruel and unusual punishment. Solitary confinement is torture.

t1_dsm79sl	1	*	Reddit is allowed in China
t1_dsl43o1	0	*	Right, because communism liberates people and the Chinese went into Tibet for the benefit of the people who lived there, they absolutely had no ulterior motives. Gimme a break man.
t1_dsa3vfl	0	*	But having homeless people is?  Nimby behaviour.  
t1_dsbik6b	1	*	My argument has somehow gone from people shouldn't be arrested for being homeless to homeless people should be allowed to shit wherever they like.
t1_dt3cji0	1	*	Makes sense, hydrogen sulphide is the closest thing to water chemically.

t1_dselbyr	0	*	Yea I just dont see hows that related to the thread.
t1_dser4xu	0	*	Semi-true. They would lose the *civilian* side of foreign affairs, and maybe a couple of European countries. The biggest patrons, like the US, will continue to provide just as much if not more.

t1_dsett6t	0	*	> US/Israel collaborator government  Mashallah my brother. Surely you will one day triumph over the Jews with rhetoric like this.

t1_dusztic	0	*	The difference is that there are huge debates over the things you pointed out, not in China.

t1_dtbzfy0	0	*	Are you implying that todays Iraq is better than what it was pre 2003?
t1_dtc0oos	0	*	I've never been there and I'm not even white, so I'm not sure what you're trying to tell me.
t1_dtc6zxv	0	*	Except we actually were killing kids in Vietnam
t1_dtbw4rw	0	*	And if every soldier held hands and sang songs, it would have been a sing-a-long dictatorship. But both of those things are what amount to an impossibility, so that isn't a good line of thinking.
t1_dtfv28z	1	*	Thank you for sharing your perspective, I appreciate the genuine response.   I'll share [this](https://youtu.be/_DboMAghWcA) with you too, you may appreciate it as well.
t1_dtd28ja	0	*	Then why did you respond? Or are you just shouting aimlessly into whatever void you come across? Do you try to join random conversations on the street?
t1_dtbvbta	1	*	2.
t1_dtbzkoz	0	*	Theres a meme in America that all mass shootings are just false flag operations designed to take our guns. Just read the comments on any youtube video of the Vegas sniper. 
t1_dtby76d	0	*	I'm still in.  Physical Therapy now.  Much higher job satisfaction.  Thanks, though.  I hope you have an awesome day! 
t1_dtbwr9u	1	*	Politics are on some level, or ought to be, rooted in reality. Do you also dismiss climate science?   Reality has a bias. 
t1_dtc0awp	1	*	The Bible has contradictions, who could have guessed?U0001f602
t1_dtbucus	0	*	Hypothesis. 
t1_dtbwrub	0	*	Can you please point me in the right direction? Cuz Apparently in my 28 years of life Ive read a lot of fake history.
t1_dtcftj2	1	*	The Taliban was certainly complicit and harbored the leaders responsible. 
t1_dtcetwl	1	*	Nah.
t1_dtbu4xz	0	*	Nah are you SURE?!
t1_dtbzbxl	0	*	I dunno I feel like that is a cop out and could be used to excuse Nazi behavior. 
t1_dtdj91u	1	*	Yeah, i kinda don't buy it. It reminds me more of seeing yourself as part of the whole, brahman as the hindus call it. Which is a compelling concept to be sure. 
t1_dtccvgn	0	*	So might makes right?  Who, according to you, was the last legitimate ruler of Afghanistan?
t1_dtdpsup	0	*	You literally didnt post a single link in this thread, dude. Maybe youre confusing this one with another thread...?
t1_dtce32e	0	*	And what about the Allied bombing of Dresden? Or Tokyo? It seems like you're trying to justify the allied strategy whilst criticising the Axis strategy. But maybe I've got the wrong impression.
t1_dtbzerc	0	*	Saudi Arabia and the Taliban's own drug trade.
t1_dtc0lyk	0	*	You don't get to decide who is or isn't a Nazi, lmao
t1_dtct0ht	1	*	Yes we are responsible now because we occupy the country. 
t1_dtct5p4	1	*	If you're saying that some groups are more similar than others, sure. You will still inevitably exaggerate in-group similarities, and overestimate out-group differences.
t1_dtc7n09	0	*	This place is great
t1_dtd5px1	1	*	8th century to 13th century
t1_dtf1mw0	0	*	Answer the question Steven.
t1_dtbxh35	0	*	 a guy who wants to murder will likely find a gun anyway, thats why it doesnt matter I have him mine.  My example is more extreme but its the same point.
t1_dtd4ovw	1	*	I'm German. My country specifically and vocally refused to get involved. 
t1_dtbzh43	1	*	A ton of people I know and who are friends of mine probably would have been Nazis just because it was the popular thing at the time.
t1_dtc8hmt	1	*	Insightful comment, i totally agree, i singled out religion however because its the most common repository of dogma there is.
t1_dtc2k4a	0	*	And the majority don't want a united Ireland. Why bomb people and murder innocents for something people don't want?  Better than the people they're fighting LOL
t1_dtcaydl	1	*	Never thought of it like that, interesting perspective. Thanks. 
t1_dtccilu	1	*	Fair nuff. Edit: oh. You did say user-generated content which implies other than just a community. But whatevs
t1_dtc4kvo	0	*	Exactly. That's the point I'm making. It's them, and not the religion. Insinuate more if you want, but that's the only thing I came here to make a distinction in.
t1_dtc7v5w	0	*	And yet you seem to imply that anyone suggesting that freedom fighters have committed acts of terror are perpetuating a myth?
t1_dtdn0ao	1	*	I implied the total opposite right? That some people see it as less him outright killing people and more him failing at administration resulting in the deaths of millions?
t1_dtbynxs	0	*	Sure bud.  Edit: do you also consider Putin to have been democratically elected?
t1_dtc04pt	1	*	We don't even have to be in a war to be manipulated to join a movement.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Third_Wave_(experiment) 
t1_dtbubwm	1	*	What?
t1_dtbzspc	0	*	It's an opinion... How the fuck am I insisting anything? Who hurt you?
t1_dtc237q	1	*	Yeah it was early couldn't think 
t1_dtc3e4f	1	*	Depends if Fox News is your go to place.
t1_dtbwzbc	1	*	Why not list Mao with Hitler? They both killed millions.
t1_dumxjmk	0	*	It hurts when a country reproduce the sins his citizens suffered, right? There is a difference between a water cup and a human being
t1_duf0mer	0	*	well naturally if all the sad people kill themselves your only left with happy people... ^^^wait...
t1_dufb5zz	0	*	me & the dogs
t1_dueqt2v	0	*	Stick your dirty foreign time
t1_duf9pyt	0	*	My Dad always said divan
t1_duey3d3	0	*	No, I don't care if you have the worst Welsh accent possible, if you're smart, you're smart. John Oliver sounds classier to those not well traveled, but what he's saying screams retarded.
t1_duezr7k	0	*	It's called saving everyone's asses.  If we were there in the beginning, it wouldn't have been much of a war, would it?
t1_duf03gj	0	*	Did you memorize that? 
t1_dtoiuv5	1	*	> Can I make for X and sell for Y, and is Y high enough that the profit indicates a sustainable competitive advantage? Answer so far based on the numbers is 'no'.  
t1_dtmpk7o	1	*	Made by a bunch of workers, you mean.
t1_dtm4kot	0	*	So you are that lazy? Learn Spanish is the only thing keeping you from living in paradise and you won't learn it? I'm starting to think you don't really want to go.
t1_dtmj6kp	1	*	I wish I hadnt looked   :(
t1_dtmruh6	0	*	everyone steals from you I mean if that's how you see communism there is really no point arguing 
t1_dtmm2sp	1	*	1500s: Wow you're criticizing feudalism and yet you're wearing shoes and shirts made by feudalism!  You moron!    hmmm
t1_dto6bk8	1	*	Which third world country
t1_dtz0y1o	1	*	Bingo.
t1_dtz6mhu	0	*	I thought you got the reference.  It's a meme I'm making from It's Always Sunny
t1_dtz349y	0	*	Why would I care what young people use? 
t1_dtzo7n6	1	*	That is why he said inclusivity is important -- I guess he doesn't really believe that.   Also, reported.
t1_dtz0x7i	1	*	I see, then maybe my prediction is wrong. Well it likely is anyway since it wass just speculation, but this is just reinforces that.
t1_dtz3xyu	0	*	Powerlikes??
t1_dtyypv6	1	*	Just because I disagree with his nonsense, doesn't mean he's not spouting nonsense.
t1_du06j61	0	*	if u think u have to be Canadian to.....ugh what's the point.
t1_dtz0a3c	0	*	Don't know why people mentioning FB owns IG. Doesn't mean FB will be around as long as IG is around. Just means the owners of FB will still own a flourishing social media app/site.
t1_dtz30bc	0	*	> the_donald wound up being the most reliable source of information on reddit. So yes, pretty informative is a fair assessment.  Then it sounds like you're a lost cause. 
t1_dtzcf12	0	*	You'd think they'd have some kind of proof, if they're so sure of it. Sounds more like a bunch of salt to me.
t1_dtzmie8	1	*	No clue why, the boxes timbits come in have always been 10, 20 and 40 
t1_dtz1aoa	0	*	And we all know that laws always stop government corruption, right?
t1_du6chis	0	*	Im an Atheist so I think theyre all dumb. But the reality is that only 1 is out there (CURRENTLY) causing death, destruction, oppression, slavery, child rape & more on a regular basis. 
t1_dtz68bf	1	*	Its funny how all the conservatives collectively get autism and can't pick up on basic social cues when it comes to that clip. Woulda loved it to see Peterson or Shapiro make the same joke, I bet.
t1_du0ia3j	1	*	Son of a bitch...Im gunna write Tim Hortons corporate like Andy Dufresne until I get an answer.
t1_du107lp	0	*	Learn some actual english before you go about using it. Baron isn't the word you want. I don't know why you're insulting me. Have a nice day.
t1_dtzc5dl	0	*	Who defended either of those things? What part do you take exception to and why? Once you are old enough to make an argument and hold an adult discussion do feel free to join in.
t1_dtzdsx1	1	*	It's definitely not the same as T_D, I am only commenting on the fact that not everyone critical of the (like you said, understandable) bias is a diirty Trump supporter.
t1_dtzerqu	0	*	> Again, because most people on Reddit are liberal and just want to upvote stuff that supports their view.  Which still goes against reddiquette.  Obviously a lost battle at this point, but still.
t1_dtz0n15	0	*	Safe injection and Good Samaritan.  We also tried the carbon tax, it was a gigantic waste of time. It was a complete and utter failure and is a feel good, do nothing route.
t1_dtzpzzj	1	*	Its all good 
t1_dtzkrp6	0	*	Yeah except that's not how it works. 
t1_dtz9s8n	0	*	Lol what? Text messaging works for everybody. It's just better between Apple devices.  I'm only filtering people who won't even use their own text app and that's their fault, they're weird.
t1_dtzbfd0	1	*	Maybe, but that would be in line with UK politicians slashing the NHS budget to make it appear bad so they can point at it and say: see, we need privatization!
t1_dtzb4tu	0	*	Yeah messaging from my laptop is pretty sweet but I didn't have to download Whatsapp on my macbook pro for that.
t1_dtz2bt4	1	*	i get the feeling that was a big reason for the instagram purchase. It's way more popular than facebook in the <18yo demographic.
t1_dtz7f3a	1	*	How did you determine that his argument was shitty I am very smart.?  I read two one sentence comments that didn't fit that profile at all.  
t1_dtyq6u9	0	*	What the fuck just happened?
t1_du095z2	0	*	If this isn't supporting Isis you're batshit crazy: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bGcyuY_pBLM
t1_dtzqp86	1	*	Still confused. 
t1_dtz4hnr	0	*	So you contribute nothing to the discussion, throw out an ad hominem, and then pretend like the other person can't be debated with.  Astounding.
t1_dtzfkoa	0	*	Yip. Fully agree!  A locked-in ecosystem with no respect for local culture, values, and business is disrespectful. It's like eColonialism.
t1_dtz3p0n	1	*	Yeah, I noticed. Really salts my french fries though.  
t1_dtzduzd	0	*	Which conveniently is anybody who falls into those groups. 
t1_du0c3ue	0	*	Yes, he did. And Lindsey Shepard's case proves it. 
t1_dtzbvu0	1	*	Well congratulations, at least you can admit you're as shitty of a person as the ones you hate.
t1_dtzqmcx	1	*	Luckily I gauge my humour on the content and not on the people laughing.
t1_du00t94	0	*	I am also very skeptical of your claim that you would find 'liberals and socialists' there.
t1_dtzzlue	0	*	And no left leaning presenters do that?
t1_dtz5nes	0	*	You have no rebuttal so you resort to name calling.  You're the leftist cancer that needs ti be culled.  You're probably not even a USA citizen.  Are you a Russian bot? 
t1_dtzc4bu	1	*	I get the feeling you're one of those people with 20 cards in their wallet for various loyalty programs and memberships. 
t1_du05go8	0	*	He said the budget will balance itself if the economy improves, which is entirely true. It's not a particularly odd statement
t1_dtzayj1	0	*	Was just trying to counter the statement thats its up and up for Facebook across the board. Fine, yes, U.S only.
t1_dtz4xxh	1	*	Goddamn shithole country  --Trump, modified
t1_dtzcifx	1	*	Yes but let's not parse details
t1_dtzbbdd	1	*	Canadian = merican
t1_dtz3bll	1	*	Yeah. I was being completely serious in my replies to them. If this is what we're seeing, imagine what their mental state in real life has been like lately. 
t1_duaozdj	1	*	Seeing as how black people only make up 14% of the population, they would* not have an equal number of anything.
t1_duqrmr4	0	*	And you also pretty clearly offered no sources, dummy. 
t1_dur29ve	1	*	This was such a fantastic read! Thanks! 
t1_duqrv8g	1	*	but the advertising and marketing says it will make me feel better about myself.
t1_duqx4x9	1	*	No, because it hasn't happened yet, you fucking goon.
t1_duqvagb	1	*	Touch blue to make it true. No erasies
t1_duqvwrm	1	*	Dyson vacuums suck and their flans blow.
t1_duqu98z	1	*	You mean Dick Cheney was the worst president of our generation 
t1_dur3vs7	1	*	Its not the federal governments fault some areas of California are overtaxed. As a whole, people in the Bay Area are better of in quality of life than most of America.
t1_duqokdo	1	*	Nobody does. It's like President Dyson was erased from history, 
t1_duqgiyb	0	*	How many presidents do you know? 
t1_duqnjlz	1	*	See Brian Dyson. 86-91.
t1_durbdit	1	*	I'm not sure about treason, per we. I do think that it's well within the realm of possibility, if not probability, that he has committed a variety of high crimes and misdemeanors.
t1_duqpmi6	0	*	NN have been saying it for over a year. If there was anything on Trump they would have used it to stop him from winning. 
t1_dusbpe2	0	*	Rasmussen. Dont need to see anything more. Let me know if you can find a poll from a second source saying the same thing, I bet you can't. Fox News, Breitbart...?
t1_duqm75k	0	*	Go back to then
t1_duqle62	1	*	If we're honest, I never liked that guy.  Seemed like a rules\-lawyer.
t1_duqi2hd	1	*	I heard about a Dyson with some big balls?
t1_duq905d	0	*	Conspiracy against the US though? I just think there is way to much we dont know.
t1_duqtyo6	1	*	5
t1_duqp6op	0	*	Wot. How many tho??
t1_duqwlm2	1	*	When is then going to be now?
t1_dtr47kf	1	*	Way to keep your cool with this guy, that dudes clearly suffering from some hockey related head injury.
t1_dspvt7u	0	*	Careful, someone will say the same thing about an atrocity that you might care about. 
t1_dsp32zv	0	*	Im Israeli, and im posting on an article that's relevant to me.... SHOCKER!  
t1_dsrwzxn	0	*	Also, if you honestly think 45 second clips that are obviously badly translated can somehow rewrite the IDF's own account of what happened, then reality does not matter. 
t1_dsoas0z	0	*	Lots of Israelis travel there, what hotels dont allow them?
t1_dsqbxeq	1	*	i wish one day i'll come to NZ to et pizzas.. (and see the fantastic landscapes of course)
t1_dsoohxk	0	*	Genocide is emotional.  Who knew.
t1_dsoweom	1	*	Sure, you can be a nazi but not support nazism because the alternative would cost you your life 
t1_dtj7cn8	1	*	No... no they dont 
t1_dtiyp8e	0	*	You're providing it BY MAKING A LOG IN.  Is this confusing for you?
t1_dtj69is	0	*	Here's what you do then, to get a better picture of the court of public opinion:    Announce you're running for public office. Publish your browser history.
t1_dtj4odk	0	*	> They walk around telling people to dress more modestly, not to drink etc etc  In white nationalist amusement parks?
t1_dtxkdby	0	*	That's entirely speculative
t1_dtxkffc	0	*	Do you even economics bro?
t1_dtxlb6b	1	*	See my comment below for why that doesn't apply to the economy of Dubai. 
t1_du2t337	0	*	Have you ever been around camp area?
t1_dsxvd9b	0	*	Fair enough; I might have underestimated their influence due to them standing behind US nowadays.   Perhaps it'd be less acceptable now if US was not at the wheel.
t1_dtswt13	0	*	What about JFK... did the CIA do it?
t1_dtqwaeg	0	*	They can't discredit specific material because they would be revealing sources. They were explicitly told not to do that by the Democrats! It's lose lose!
t1_duv9gbq	0	*	lol you just can't place blame on other cultures can you?  Arab countries treated them like shit for years, even the anti-American ones.
t1_dtskplp	0	*	... this must be a British thing...
t1_dtos8vu	0	*	They absolutely have jobs, we seem to make them a priority over natives. This is just all from witnessing it. But I know, its a very foggy topic.
t1_dtorv9y	0	*	Which country? 
t1_dtoqg1y	1	*	What? Everyone chuckled a bit halfheartedly last time I said it...
t1_dtq4bsb	0	*	Jesus you are trying too hard.
t1_dtosmsa	0	*	Ok.
t1_dtoh4xe	0	*	Shooting random black people is textbook racism.   It's incredible how fascist reddit has turned in the last couple of years.
t1_dtokpdi	0	*	30M dead, the vast majority being innocent, wasnt a good thing, in my opinion.
t1_dtojyl3	1	*	Speculation /= explaining.
t1_dtohz75	1	*	Oh man, that makes the justification even better.
t1_dtohxkk	0	*	Look, Im anti-Confederacy and pro-Native American rights, but [history is complicated. ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_American_slave_ownership)
t1_dtoig90	0	*	I thought you were replying to my comment about Islam, and not the guy who brought up the VP and glass house b.s.  My bad, carry on.
t1_dtpn0tg	1	*	And you ask a historian or anyone with knowledge they'll say it was about slavery, which just happened to be a states rights issue.
t1_dtp6xmc	1	*	Unrelated, I think. 
t1_dtouavw	1	*	Exactly! :d
t1_dtongkv	0	*	Yeah dude, I am 27 and still technically a millennial because I was born in 91. 
t1_dtor1nl	1	*	I didn't know that, that's absolutely hilarious
t1_dtovvwd	1	*	Lol.  /r/youareadumbfuck
t1_dtopfsb	1	*	Whoa. Learned quite a bit here. Thanks for the interesting data and links.
t1_dtouosv	0	*	And gas for helicopters.  But you know, details, details.
t1_dtomyf2	1	*	if the refugees were placed evenly in all countries then it would be 1 to 750, but they go to a few countries. Germany got 1 million ( ? ) in 2015/16 so that was something like 1 to 80. 
t1_dtogf35	0	*	A substantial number of people flying it (damn near all) are ignorant as hell, or lying.
t1_dtozasa	0	*	I have news for you. Back then 'the wild west' wasn't what you think it is either. Wyatt Earp was Marshall of a city in Kansas.
t1_dtoi9aa	1	*	Its no surprise that a guy defending the hurritage of fascism is also active in the_dotard. Hes just baiting
t1_dtopgwh	0	*	no it isn't. The real problem is integration. And racism.
t1_dtovuxo	0	*	Because chopping up a body and disposing of it takes a bit of effort and planning.   It's not something that happens by accident.
t1_dtoz7i6	1	*	All Socialists are shitty. Him being a former teenager has a lot less to do with him becoming a dictator than him being a former Socialist does.  
t1_dtoow7y	1	*	Facts, and poor is also relative to where you live. I could make 6 figures and be poor in California. I'm a college student in Tuscaloosa, AL, the cost of housing here vs San Francisco is 87.1% less.
t1_dtoqsjr	0	*	Yea like weaponizing the IRS, CIA, DOJ, FBI for use against political opponents. 
t1_dtoyyk7	1	*	> just trying to rationalize why people with different skin color experiences racism when traveling about.  Because racist people exist, thats literally the reason.
t1_dtonb57	1	*	But we have a short attention span and only remember the last 15 years or so 
t1_dtou5jy	0	*	Looks like you forgot to log out of your alt account 
t1_dtp4y2j	0	*	Uh, no it's not. There have been many points in time with way more terrorism. Violence itself (wars, murders etc.) are also on a decline for a while.
t1_dtop12r	0	*	Uh oh, he noticed a problem and observed facts, now I get to label him as a racist! 
t1_dtojdt3	0	*	How can you say that the revolution that led to millions of dead and the birth of the worst dictatorship ever a good thing?
t1_dtotkix	1	*	I'm pretty sure your right.  It's just so weird seeing it here!  When I think Austria I think double headed eagle and edelweiss or Lederhosen and beer.  Not Confederate flags and cowboy stores.
t1_dts6cya	0	*	The spectrum changes buddy. The liberals that gave us democracy and equality are rightwing in todays political landscape. Back then everyone was leftwing if they werent monarchists.
t1_dtp0akg	0	*	So what you're saying is, women don't matter really in the scheme of things. Is that it?
t1_dtoq5jc	1	*	I'm not disagreeing with you, but the You're doing what this group of people do, so you must be part of this group argument is tired.
t1_dtoo3oj	1	*	Honestly most of this thread is missing eachothers points. When the Cf gets brought up everyone kinda closes off to new opinions.
t1_dtqzywk	0	*	Oh really? Since you obviously know *so* much about guns, what's the work around to make a Mini 14 fully automatic without using a sear trigger?
t1_dtoe0dp	0	*	Nah man  don't lump all of us Americans in with the nonsense on reddit. All the 15 year old leftists on reddit just can't think past race. 
t1_dtoktcl	0	*	>I'm not left or right  >But one side is way worse  Either you're lying or you know one side is better and you aren't choosing it. What gives?
t1_dtuvh2s	0	*	>Italy wasn't a country until a hundred years after the USA,  I'd always heard the Renaissance started in Italy (?)
t1_dtomh3v	0	*	Absolutely! Big difference between inland and coastal too! Tbh, its all fucking delicious lol U0001f930U0001f3fb. Every year I go back, I have to pack eating clothes. 
t1_dtohz6y	1	*	Barely anyone wants it to be banned. Freedom of speech is not freedom of consequences that arise because of that speech; in this instance, publicly outing yourself as an ignorant racist hick. 
t1_dtouxuq	0	*	> To quote Peter Kropotkin in his Conquest of Bread  I thought i bet this guy is an anarchist
t1_dtq1t3s	0	*	How?
t1_dtos4j5	1	*	Not true, because the war was really an armed insurrection to keep slavery, and had to be ended by crushing that insurrection, and not just freeing the slaves.
t1_dtofffd	0	*	It's not about slavery and racial hatred against black people, it's about the cultural heritage of slavery and racial hatred against black people!
t1_dtoqy14	0	*	That didn't mean that they couldn't have been convinced after circumstances made it more favorable. France didn't support the colonies until they won a number of battles on their own.
t1_dtorg1v	1	*	His jumping volley against wimbledon is a screamer though. 
t1_dtom6ve	1	*	damn bruh we get it, you French 
t1_dtpl2ft	1	*	>Also apparently white countries are the only ones worth visiting to you.  Yeah wasn't saying that at all. G'night
t1_dtogmw9	1	*	If someone is flying the Nazi flag, Im going to  assume theyre a Nazi. If someone is flying the confederate flag, Im going to assume theyre lacking all knowledge of context and history 
t1_dtomj81	0	*	But it still is an irrational fear, and with education and effort you can make it go away 
t1_dtolf4x	1	*	> /u/uppermiddleclasss  _  (j/k, yes, i get your point)
t1_dtp29ra	1	*	Great and swastikas were around for thousands of years before ww2
t1_dtopyth	0	*	Right, which is basically what I said.  Italians did pretty well in small ship engagements.
t1_dtpqv8w	1	*	Here is a winning formula.  Less crime and less migrants = less racists  I'm biracial so spare me the you're racist nonsense.
t1_dtoke7k	1	*	Yeah well, I dont either lol, good luck out there, dont let them win 
t1_dtoloze	0	*	Anytime, Mr. Catgrease
t1_dtovp2n	1	*	That was beautiful. 
t1_dtoj3kd	1	*	and never add to the statement the second half: ...to the detriment of his own country.

t1_dtqbf2g	0	*	All that racism and you somehow became an engineer. You seem to look down on indians. Who is the real racist?
t1_dtovp36	1	*	Well of course you still call them out for it.  Being used to it doesn't mean doing nothing.  It means not being surprised by it.
t1_dtowbkm	1	*	Wat
t1_duckxku	1	*	Whos pushing what on who now? 
t1_dt599af	1	*	Fine, most fields

t1_dv2wh2m	0	*	Weren't people screaming for the most recent shooter to be labeled as a terrorist as well?  That doesn't seem to be an exclusive grouping.
t1_dv0zbhm	0	*	My cousins in Holland told me about this. It seems sad that merely questioning the usefulness of the EU will get you crucified and called a racist on Reddit.

t1_dv2stpn	1	*	Im not putting depth into a reply of what I perceive to be an incredibly strong opinion. One that doesnt change when shown facts.  I just called bullshit and moved on.
t1_dv1fkiy	0	*	Freedom of movement is for EU citizens only. If someone vote for Brexit because he doesnt like to see Arabs and Indians, he is  a racist and an idiot.

t1_dv0z987	1	*	Wow, if America keeps this pace up, in a thousand years they are going to kills as many people as the Nazi's did over a few years.  Perspective.
t1_dv0pkq9	1	*	The are faster but dramatically less drastic.   Also there is no logical reason that manipulation would ever be created, and farmers already try to prevent cross contamination already. 
t1_dv0rerd	0	*	So companies get punished for farmers mistakes just because it's easier? That makes no sense.
t1_dv14k5x	1	*	And they always have sunburnt skin and open English style pubs in Spanish resorts 
t1_dv16jwh	0	*	Ah thanks. So some would rather farm because they can make more money?   Ninja edit: That tells me that there are way too many farmers. WHY??
t1_dv0ul09	1	*	And some pickles.
t1_dv0xdx4	0	*	Anti Obama sentiment was huge, but Trumps approval ratings are historically low.   Last president that faced the kind of opposition Trump is facing was Jimmy Carter

t1_dulvh5x	1	*	Yeah, what?
t1_dumi6ac	1	*	Technically Trump can't even discuss the weather accurately, so I will presume that it's the same with its vice president.

t1_dtloi7m	0	*	Without Turkey, thousands of civilians would die in Kobane. They all escaped to Turkey.  Also, why should Turkey help PKK when they fight ISIS? It's like asking the US to help Taliban against ISIS.

t1_dughodp	1	*	This. The 1% spends billions of dollars to brainwash lower/middle America to enjoy taking it up the ass. People have to be physically hurting before the mental somersaults ever stop.
t1_duhe5my	0	*	Oh shit, so we can't take them at their word? And we can't speculate? What the fuck are we supposed to do then, Reddit?

t1_duhkm3j	1	*	Several times of thousands of years for most countries.
t1_dugp17o	1	*	Conclusion: Insufficient evidence to impeach Trump but not enough to dismiss claims. People will die ~~be killed~~ to eliminate evidence.

t1_du18eo6	1	*	Bad example. You should get *something* for dealing with the rest of the people in Florida. 
t1_du1ckw4	1	*	Yes, so we should say he's protecting his self interests. Don't simplify it down to the point where it can be said of any president.

t1_dswwph7	1	*	Well, that basically goes for everything behind the idea of Christianity, but it is pretty confirmed that it originated with the catholic faith.

t1_dsmzc7i	1	*	If you were having a conversation with a native and described them as a redskin, how do you think they would take it? Probably not as an honor.

t1_dsn0o8m	1	*	lmao im not the one complaining about others comments. im just saying you are failing at your own goal 
t1_dsn1psl	1	*	They're going a little crazy with it, honestly. It's mostly just that Merlin used magic to make people think that Arthur was a dude because they wouldn't want a woman to be King.
t1_dsmocc9	1	*	Take your upvote and go to your room. 
t1_dsmyxad	0	*	Trump decided not to come off his own back though. He was and still is allowed to come here.
t1_dsnznmf	1	*	Yes, suppressing free speech is exactly what nazis would do. As would demonizing any opposition.   How exactly is Milo a Nazi? He's a douchebag sure but in what way was he a nazi?

t1_ds4nt2t	1	*	Saying they are only getting 23% of what men are getting for the same job IS already a lie
t1_ds2ttej	0	*	That's....that's what I am trying to say. Women get paid maternity leave at some jobs, but the fact is they still take time off. You don't get overtime as a woman on paid maternity leave.

t1_ds415du	0	*	Geez, you're not making this easy. The question was implied by the statement. Why defend Trump? These rationalizations for his tweets wont convince anyone, so what are you getting out of it?

t1_dt8zq9s	0	*	Hillary has the election clinched. Said all the numbers. 
t1_dt953hm	0	*	What you think and what reality is are very far apart. I suspect that statement has many applications in your life. 
t1_dtaidha	1	*	Then you're wrong.
t1_dt97ph4	1	*	Gerrymandering has nothing to do with the electoral college, and thus nothing to do with the Presidential Election.
t1_dt9ou06	0	*	Is that the way round? I knew she only got one of two, but can never remember which way round it is. Also- nice reference to the Hungarian Palatine!
t1_dt95hij	1	*	Not the question I asked. I know, historically, who wrote which documents.  Are *you* willing to answer the question I asked? 
t1_dt8vjap	0	*	So now *you* are *not* okay with hate speech? Last time I heard, hypocrisy is not illegal. Nonetheless, I don't display my hatred publicly.

t1_dt9xknv	0	*	I will take a lower gun homicide rate and TV licence summons over guns and the social issues in the US. Even brexit isn't making me want to move to the US.
t1_dt8zji1	1	*	That was the inspiration for it, I believe.
t1_dt8zv70	1	*	Even Trump said unemployment was actually 40% and GDP was less than zero. God he's so fucking stupid.

t1_dt96l72	1	*	You know the disparity between the weight of those votes has become more significant over the past 200 years, right?
t1_dt9vkbt	1	*	Well yes, they're politicians. What they say they support isn't necessarily what they actually support.

t1_ducqtxy	1	*	Obviously, but the DNC and GOP still spread propaganda on a similar level of bullshit, and should accordingly be called out for it.
t1_due7pu5	1	*	CNN has earned that reputation by chasing being first so hard that they often get the story wrong initially.
t1_ducwh66	0	*	I think there's definitely a way to prevent it - social media networks have to be forced to crack down on fake and suspicious accounts.

t1_dt0j7g0	0	*	You realize there was civil war in Libya that started well before any American intervention.
t1_dt0kogq	0	*	This is incorrect and you cannot provide a source where the KSA government has committed terror.    Now the KSA civilians have sponsored and committed terror but not wth government support.
t1_dt0yfjp	0	*	Overthrowing Ghaddafi was Frances idea, though, not the US.
t1_dt0nhnh	0	*	Saudi is definitely not the mirror image. Israel isnt intentionally trying to bomb civilians, they go out of their way to avoid it and retaliate when rockets are lobbed at them. 
t1_dt0mzf8	0	*	Why on earth do I always think people on the internet have the ability to think?
t1_dt0mabv	0	*	Look at that huge spike in imported oil from 76-80 under Carter. Reagan came in and cut that shit out.

t1_dt0xss6	0	*	We dont use oil for power generation, typically speaking.

t1_dt2gmjc	1	*	Not saying they shouldnt be considered an import, but I found it worth noting because of their special status with respect to the common market.
t1_dt15586	0	*	And let's not forget that in public the British issued the Balfour declaration, and then in private they forcefully compelled the Arab states to declare war on Israel and even led their armies.

t1_dtqqv8e	1	*	Is there a better reason?
t1_dsvu4b3	1	*	Realistically they know most of their members aren't pro marijuana so them endorsing a person who purchased it  illegaly because of marijuana usage is unlikely. 
t1_dsw5e8e	0	*	Oh so you believe that just because something was written on parchment, its infallible, do you?
t1_dsx00x7	1	*	So only the rich should be able to have guns. Should only the rich have healthcare as well? 
t1_dt8938o	0	*	The burden of proof is on you, my friend. You're the one claiming his racism. Show me quotes. Prove your thesis.

t1_dsvbj7b	0	*	Whoops for a second there I thought you might be worth talking to. Won't make that mistake again.
t1_dsxwf75	0	*	Accepting campaign donations from foreign sources is illegal. Ally or not is irrelevant, so it is definitely comparable.
t1_dswm9cr	0	*	The point is never to make guns scarce. Where did you get such a stupid fucking idea? Guns are more important than universal suffrage, or that would have been part of the Bill of Rights.

t1_dsvrwc2	1	*	Yeah, the last one is tricky because the people who genuinely believe that Obama's coming to take their guns (and weirdly enough still do) probably wouldn't pass one...
t1_dswoutj	1	*	A lot of them also forget that their glorious hero Ronald Reagan was a huge gun control pusher. Granted, it was racist as fuck so they probably loved it, but still. 
t1_dswz90s	1	*	You are the only 1st world country that has a mass shooting every year. Google gun death stats and you can see the epidemic for yourself.

t1_dtxysad	1	*	Just one confuse unit each. But they were big confuses.
t1_dty3o3o	0	*	States do decide on whether to observe DST or not.  The Feds determine where the time zone boundaries are (and that does change, counties have hopped lines a few times).

t1_dty1t0a	1	*	True. Or just have everyone run off standard time and let businesses decide if they want to adjust hours? Go even more individualized.

t1_dudh6k1	0	*	What's your beef with Liberalism? Is it the people who support it, or the ideals it follows?
t1_dudtnyb	1	*	No, I've added an /s to my comment.

t1_dudav2o	1	*	Who approached the trump campaign again?
t1_due8b2u	0	*	large bureaucracy, ineffective, bloated cost to do their job.  
t1_dud52se	0	*	Yeah I meant consensus, typo.  
t1_dudlvxn	1	*	I agree with that assessment. Cementing support among Trump's base, however, is a rational reason why Russia would fund an anti-Trump rally.
t1_dud5x19	1	*	There are a lot of assumptions with that theory tho, and not a lot of evidence to back those points.
t1_duddbtv	0	*	You wouldn't say that if Hillary won
t1_dud75ml	1	*	Who cares, russians probably put some shills on whatever side he is on anyway.
t1_dud6klf	0	*	Whoever would have thought that absolute freedom of speech would have turned out not to be an unmitigated good? (Other than philosophers of course.)
t1_dudkni5	0	*	You gotta be kidding me. We already pay state taxes for all those things. Our federal taxes should go toward the military and thats it. Let the people keep their money and use it how they wish
t1_dud3o5o	0	*	I never even claimed it was over? I said going after 13 individuals, who cannot even be extradited, for subverting an entire democracy through trolling, sounds a bit like a witch hunt. 
t1_due2oa4	0	*	> Nobody is proving you right.  Sorry, but you're wrong.  >You sound like you are either 17 years old, or a McCarthyism-brainwashed hack.  Projection really is rampant among Trump supporters.

t1_dudkr86	0	*	I mean, are you Russian?
t1_dud7fi1	1	*	Russians had that strategy back in the 1980s.  They would send out sports and cultural teams out to western europe pre-invasion, that during attack would start blowing shit up.
t1_dud5e4j	1	*	Yeah I saw they just blocked the one guys website trying to run for something. 
t1_duday05	1	*	How they were revealed isnt the issue.

t1_duaelb2	1	*	Because you're a racist right wing conspiracy nut and war hungry neocon like your khaleesi who can't stop jerking it to how many disadvantaged brown people they kill?

t1_dt6oppc	1	*	I'm sorry that exiling criminals isn't as bad as systematic murder and genocide. 
t1_dt8f7r9	1	*	I thought you were making the liberal attack on the last election. Yea I agree but the system is always rigged, look at the DNC with super delegates or the RNC with primaries. 
t1_dt6xf75	0	*	So what you are saying is morally a penal colony is worse than killing people.
t1_dt6rlnr	1	*	So...you are saying you can't think of a religious war that depleted Europe other than the most glaring example? I don't get your point? 
t1_dt7twup	1	*	What are you even talking about?
t1_dt6pobu	0	*	Yeah we're doing pretty good aren't we? Maybe your country should have tried winning. I'm not going to make any excuses for events that transpired a century before I was born.

t1_du2vopf	0	*	Hahaha I understand that you dont put those fuckin idiots on tv!
t1_duencbw	0	*	Well, no. Because you can make it all-electric, which is a lot harder with conventional fuels.   Might not be worth it in the long run, who knows. But there is a reason it's been proposed. 
t1_duftwk1	0	*	I guess we have to agree on disagreeing. No bad feelings. edit: I see your point and I think it's true to a degree but only if you take on a certain moral stance - what I am unwilling to do.

t1_duey6h0	1	*	Who is the leader of the resistance against Trump?
t1_ds5q6qj	1	*	I agree, it is a little accelerationist though. It might hurt in the short term and we might have to deal with uncomfortable truths, but long term its for the best tbh.
t1_ds5pwbu	0	*	How many historical examples do we have of it's not the act, but the cover up that gets people in trouble. If Trump and his goons had 2 brain cells in the group l, they'd know this.

t1_ds5wkf9	0	*	Both the conviction and the trial is called impeaching. Bill Clinton wasn't impeached because he wasn't thrown from office, but he was impeached because he was tried.
t1_ds5d0gf	1	*	I'm not sure if he had a problem with public speaking or intentionally spoke that way/messed up to seem more likable and just like a normal guy.  But I agree with everything else you said.

t1_ds5i950	0	*	Repeating it doesnt make this any more true. 
t1_ds5lz79	1	*	My advice is don't take them half as seriously as they take themselves, and make sure you get out and vote your interests, locally as well as nationally.
t1_ds5idwt	1	*	...and hopefully war with North Korea isnt one of the options.
t1_ds4uxao	0	*	So those opinions are people should not have to resign over assault and harassment claims? Those are bad opinions.

t1_ds5nhrj	1	*	Indeed.
t1_ds5lo88	1	*	I was raised in the era when this kind of thing was regularly offered at parties. Need some serious therapy after seeing it back in the mainstream.
t1_ds4ufee	1	*	Absolutely. I agree with Trump and hate Roy Moore and there will be more to come that I will want to resign, but it's crazy the hoops people will jump through to defend their politicians.
t1_ds5oqz7	1	*	> dignity  Are we talking about the same guy?
t1_ds5nsu1	1	*	They're autonomous.  Tribes are not subject to state income tax, and tribal casinos do not pay the corporate income tax.  They do have to pay a sales tax on non-natives buying cigs and booze.

t1_du5hby4	0	*	It's not how any government works with a 4 year term, which is why we ended up with that problem.

t1_dv3fwyy	1	*	Are you mixing up your conversations? This is a thread about how they should be investigated by a congressional committee, and you responded that they should because they failed to perform some duty.

t1_dv3615g	0	*	I didn't axe for this. I'm not a libarian.

t1_dv3hge6	1	*	FBI probably has more access here then a shit site like 4chan. I imagine the logging and databases are full of great information that 4chan doesn't even store
t1_dv3snej	0	*	Actually getting over it and having a discussion about what issues we want solved and not which candidate would be far more productive 
t1_dv5z2xf	1	*	BUT WAIT, THERE'S MORE!
t1_dv4e3p6	0	*	What the fuck did he say that was racist? This is why the phrase has no meaning anymore.

t1_dv38502	1	*	I don't know
t1_dv3j8yh	0	*	I think we all learned never to underestimate human stupidity in 2016.  Can't wait until they vote a fictional character into the Presidency. My money is on hologram Ronald Reagan.

t1_dv39xbx	0	*	Or...couldn't someone just argue yeah we got sick of updating it, whatever. I'm lazy Does there really have to even be a reason given? 
t1_dv3bwbn	1	*	No insecure, no insecure, you're the insecure.
t1_dv3dm2v	0	*	No, I was making a joke. 
t1_dswnhia	1	*	In that case, have a nice day. 
t1_dt58qfz	0	*	It isn't that terribly bad, overall it's been fairly neutral, aside from the media having a shit storm every day of the week. The US, at least in Asia is seen in a stronger light at the moment.
t1_dt65jbx	1	*	Sure.  So the US should just let China steal the entire South China Sea.  At least theyll be consistent if that happens, right?
t1_dt63h0i	1	*	I think American companies do it for sure. But who is worse? I think the Asian countries.
t1_dt5hv1u	0	*	Interesting considering your rhetoric is indistinguishable from theirs and you seem to be spewing right-wing quackery all over this thread.. 
t1_dt5wfbt	0	*	Wow TDS much?  Also, according to laws, if a country has the power they can embargo another nation. Especially on conflict. Also, I almost feel like I'm talking to a TDS suffering Russiaboo.
t1_dt65xuj	0	*	Don't ask childishly simple questions if you're gonna be offended when somebody provides a suitable answer.
t1_dt584n8	0	*	Are you suggesting she didn't support any coups as Sec. of State? Or that she didn't campaign on shooting down Russian planes fighting ISIS in Syria?

t1_dtbaotu	1	*	Russian.  Drop out.  Russia.
t1_dt4uljm	0	*	Exactly why I am not against tariffs for China both from a EU and US perspective, but I am against tariffs between the two. If you play fair and on the same level, there should be no protectionism

t1_dsqreee	0	*	It should really be a moot point though, since the x-rays are actually of a totally different person.
t1_dsq5oj9	0	*	So you didn't read the article or Op's claims.....  Ok, so you are trolling.   Have a nice day. 
t1_dsqa66x	1	*	My god you are dense...

t1_dsznxao	0	*	What did the Stern Gang do that was 1/10 as bas as using a child as a bomb? When did they blow people up in markets? I mean I get it, you can't find it in yourself to condemn that.  
t1_dt0jhgi	1	*	Well, that is also the case, obviously, but I'd prefer to not have the people who are many times as likely to commit crime.

t1_dsfp45f	0	*	Why is it a problem that theres less women in tech? Who gives a shit if its mostly men or misty women?
t1_dsf5365	0	*	Every race has different cultures, no? The culture of a black person who has lived in America their whole life is different from a black person who just moved from Somalia, no?

t1_dsfgv32	0	*	No, and definitely not when a disproportionate amount of qualified people who apply are white men.
t1_dsfdkmn	0	*	Being black or female (or while we're on the subject being really short) has absolutely no impact on your ability to code. So that analogy doesn't work.

t1_dtrm8qn	1	*	It's not. glad you've never had issues but it's not 100% reliable.
t1_dtrlrm9	1	*	I've never experienced it messing up, but it does become more work. Easier to keep the things you want to hide from your rents on a different site (Snap, IG, etc) entirely.

t1_dtshxbk	1	*	redditors aren't really facebook/instagram's target demographic. if it weren't working for them, they would do something that did. 
t1_dtsa3ym	1	*	Maybe next you should follow an SPCA blog and complain about animal pictures.  What do you seriously think Facebook is for? That's your problem.
t1_dts5afb	0	*	Just because your messages are encrypted doesnt mean things like who you contact and how often are off limits. They actively will mine that data all day.
t1_dtroyfs	1	*	Most of the issues on this thread seem to be from people not understanding how to use FB's settings.
t1_dtriw0e	1	*	U good 
t1_dtrgb0g	1	*	Of course :) hope you figure something out. 
t1_dtrkcx8	0	*	Well, facebook is fairly sloppy, it wouldnt surprise me if the settings changed back to the default randomly, or something along those lines. 
t1_dtssmle	1	*	It's always been split in my life time (30 odd years), but looking at Wiki it appears they started to split in the 70's, and finished in 1989.

t1_dts8w8g	1	*	Sw429, is that you?! I can't believe it!
t1_dtrio4v	1	*	Helping your relatives with their IT problems costs you more than all the money in the world.  If you ever wondered how it was to be an abused slave, help your relatives with their PC.

t1_dtrqbfq	1	*	i mean it is. i have never heard that word in my life. 
t1_dtrewo6	1	*	well he did win the ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny...
t1_dtrkemd	1	*	As someone who used to get commandeered by elderly relatives for help with menial computer tasks all the time, $100 a year to fob all that work off is a steal!
t1_dtrhflq	0	*	well they didn't ban it, they just made it taste bad.
t1_dtrmdt0	1	*	When someone has worked at Walmart 10+ years or was in store management and then had to take a minimum wage job. Yes sadly you can. 
t1_dtrtqoy	1	*	So you disagree with the previous comment?
t1_duup3gd	0	*	Hey, at least my dad loves me lol
t1_dtrmcbr	0	*	Think of tabs as RAM and bookmarks as a harddrive. Yes you're saving stuff for later with tabs.... But not long-term, that's when you bookmark.
t1_dtrgtph	0	*	She could just untag herself from the picture. It stops it showing on her own feed and it doesn't notify the original poster that you untagged yourself.
t1_dttbd6i	1	*	Fair enough though imo facebook is still pretty bad.
t1_dtrddpq	0	*	Can I play my blockbuster movies on a Kmart?
t1_dtrpjm9	1	*	That's true. I was making the point of some people need to set up barriers to keep others from having public meltdowns instead of keeping it private
t1_dtrrddg	1	*	Are the popes socks holey? 
t1_duuozas	1	*	Thank you
t1_dtsl8bz	1	*	chrome is still a hog. i have to use the great suspender extension. really helps when i wanna come back to a set of tabs but don't wanna bookmark but still need to open after effects.
t1_dtratgy	1	*	Fair point. I was born in 1975 and was using a personal computer from age five onward. Tech savvy is tech savvy regardless of generation.

t1_dtrejbl	1	*	some day i will escape this hell ;_;
t1_dts4dh7	0	*	How about this.  Don't show my likes or comments to anyone! I have a very conservative family. I can't be myself on FB because they can see what I say. 
t1_dtrts4q	0	*	The point is she is keeping friends and family who *do* care updated. If it causing you issues, there *is* an unfollow button on Facebook.
t1_dtrjcb0	0	*	Thanks a lot. It really is quite something.
t1_dskmwpc	1	*	Every race seems to be just as racist, it's just that whites hold more positions of power so their racism is more detrimental. 
t1_dt47z8m	0	*	Bullshit. The solar boom predates the Chinese governments manipulation of their solar production market.
t1_duhqqxf	1	*	Yes it is, just not under normal circumstances. A person with any sort of sore/wound in their mouth can transmit Hep C like this. As can someone with bleeding gums.
t1_dtf6fgc	0	*	You would like me to find you a source that states minimum wage hasn't changed in two years? Or one that states inflation has risen in the last two years?
t1_dubdrpl	0	*	I read it and it did not reveal anything new. Trolls are not limited to Russian propaganda. I hope you realize that, do you need examples?
t1_dubp30h	0	*	Can you post a study I don't have to pay 10 dollars for? 
t1_dublvl0	0	*	Nope
t1_dubtgf7	1	*	likewise. the old instinct 'judge others by actions and self by intentions' seems to extend to the global stage too.  Cheers
t1_ducpuqx	1	*	I'm not opposed to spending money on either issue but I am absolutely opposed to policy and rhetoric that would curtail freedoms in the name of fighting terrorism.

t1_duccrfn	0	*	That showed up in deeply buried comments like you summoned a fuckin genie? I intentionally saught out deeply buried comments to test this on. 
t1_dubp2ig	1	*	Not even worth the discussion. 
t1_dubt3i7	1	*	I'm really not getting your point here; is there one?
t1_duc986f	1	*	Why you have been brainwashed? Because you lack critical thinking? I don't know you tell me.
t1_ductud9	1	*	U0001f92b
t1_duboou1	1	*	Right. What a joke, look at any of the pages from the link provided, that's clearly not what happened.
t1_dubqgjz	0	*	They literally do back up my statement.  Right wingers fall victim to fake news more than the left.
t1_dubk0kj	1	*	The FBI forbade its officers from revealing the extent of the Russian bribery scheme, the primary agent involved has testified.

t1_dudgxb1	0	*	Okay, keep using it and look like a fool 
t1_dubozmg	0	*	A+, mature response that definitely addresses my points. You can link to individual comments. I skimmed through that entire thread and not one top comment called all NRA members terrorists 
t1_dubpbu5	0	*	I tend to roll my eyes at some of the anti trump posts but then I see comments like yours and it makes me hate him.
t1_ducdzno	1	*	Not by itself, but it would put us in a position to solve some of them that we aren't in now.  Not that it matters, because we won't do it.
t1_dubk27m	1	*	He doesn't sound like a Hispanic Democrat to me.
t1_dubexnd	1	*	Good on you for keeping your cool against someone named dicky_cockpunch that is clearly just trolling.

t1_dtl2ail	1	*	Im waiting for those job vacancies... 
t1_dtm6ymw	1	*	I understand.  Thanks for taking the time to have an actual discussion about this. Most people just lash out and don't really address the argument. 
t1_dtkyxwl	0	*	i like the way this guy thinks. also, theres tons of us who uave barely taken any antibiotics before, so
t1_dtkwh25	0	*	The banning of non-vegetarian restaurants is not part of a broader legal effort to limit the consumption of meat?
t1_dtl2ves	1	*	[Yes](https://i.imgur.com/GYkAUyy.jpg)
t1_dtl4jif	1	*	The point here is to stop over-prescribing, not stop prescribing altogether for indicated uses.
t1_dtmj10a	1	*	India chicken population is over 700 million and the US is 2 billion. I wouldn't call that an order of magnitude.  They are also growing their chicken industry at a much faster pace.
t1_dtl2ggn	1	*	Insightful rebuttal.....
t1_dtl396i	1	*	Maybe they could just stop eating animals if they get that fucked up by bacteria. Soybeans don't need antibiotics to grow. 
t1_dtkz020	0	*	We could lose 80% of the human population and still have more people than there were after 1920. 
t1_dtlgtxp	1	*	A.i. Is the solution.
t1_dtlawva	0	*	r/writingprompts
t1_dtlbxjj	1	*	Soon, with this kind of antibiotics abuse by the food industry and doctors who prescribe it carelessly, we will get back to a state were nothing can be done because the antibiotics wont work anymore 
t1_dtl362k	1	*	Sounds stupid to me
t1_dtl9k0p	1	*	It would also actually do some societal good instead of the current direction it's taken.

t1_dtl4o6m	1	*	Its all part of the plan!
t1_dtl20vt	0	*	TIL Reddit thinks the only thing that matters regarding global warming is what is happening right at this moment and the history of what got us here is a side-note
t1_dtl831m	1	*	There should be a complete ban on the use of antibiotics of last resort on anything other than humans. I mean serious economy-wrecking threats and sanctions against any violators.
t1_dtlgwgj	1	*	Ah there you are, Mr Brightside.

t1_dtmfv0y	0	*	Does she have an overlying disease that makes her immune system suppressed.  It sounds like she could have something.
t1_dtl2y76	0	*	Because all medicine is not interchangeable.  If you break your leg, cough syrup won't help.
t1_dtln8ud	0	*	Or that the parents are so overworked all the time that they have no time or energy to care. 
t1_dtl8k04	1	*	And instead of using them to save lives we're burning them on having cheap meat.

t1_dtkx0h0	0	*	Limiting immigration to high-skilled applicants and poaching high-skilled applicants are two completely different concepts. The former is a strainer, the latter is a vacuum. 
t1_dtkzn62	1	*	The goverment could make it expensive with taxes. But people would still use it and only poor and sick people would be victim of this.
t1_dtlqlvl	1	*	There are hundreds of millions of people in india living in abject poverty, without east access to food

t1_dtldtu4	1	*	Sounds like she might have an immune system disorder.
t1_dtmld5s	0	*	You can negotiate prices in a capitalist system. Happens all the time. Negotiated with a guy in Craigslist this week. The fact that it does happen destroys your argument
t1_dtl94k0	1	*	Maybe people should consider taking the APPROPRIATE medication instead.  Antibiotics for the flu? The flu's not caused by bacteria.
t1_dtl5s60	1	*	I don't know how you can think harming people long term for a short term profit isn't stupid.
t1_dtkzma4	1	*	Death, uh, finds a way.
t1_dtl5ry0	1	*	Another driver is the constant pressure of people in affluent developed countries, demanding cheap meat/poultry, daily.  It's kind of obscene.
t1_dtl68x9	0	*	Highly recommend watching this video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rStL7niR7gs
t1_dtkzidb	1	*	Lol
t1_dtleg30	0	*	Listen, the same muscle cells from different parts of the cow differ in taste and texture. Obviously you are an ignorant vegan who has never had quality meat so you think they are all the same.
t1_dtl1pkc	0	*	>The problem lies with big Pharma and capitalism!  The pharmaceutical industry and the associated laws are literally the only thing that keeps antibiotics from being dispensed without a prescription. 
t1_dtmbuqr	1	*	We don't even need to go after the illegal ones, just the legal guys. People probably aren't going to risk the black market just for an attempt at a cold cure.
t1_dtl8dot	1	*	What the heck happened in 2002 
t1_dtl3ptb	1	*	I think education is a big factor. Educate these fools
t1_dtl7aji	1	*	Its the resource use/allocation that's the real problem.
t1_dtl8sj0	0	*	See you're proving my point right now. You're being smug about your claims, and even though you're right this isn't how you get people to change their views. 
t1_dtmadoh	1	*	About 30-40%, so that leaves aroynd 700 million meat eaters. But yes a lot of vegetarians there, but also more meat eaters than 2x the population of the US.
t1_dtl0edp	0	*	Because corporations ever want to raise wages if they aren't forced by law?
t1_dtlb688	0	*	Tsk, tsk, namecalling. Doesn't really support your point. And using big numbers like 1000zerozero isn't that persuasive too. 
t1_dtkx79j	1	*	Colege is a scam, trade skool is were its at.

t1_dthfzf6	0	*	Okay, NOW I downvoted you because you're crying about downvoted.  That and because the rest of your statement makes it obvious that you like to speak confidently about things you don't understand.

t1_dthpnzy	0	*	What youre referring to wasnt a policy nor a proposed policy. Its a fake conversation made up by the media. No proof of it ever happening exists.

t1_dthuk1p	1	*	You caught me, I embellished the degree in which he knew the bill he sponsored and voluntarily fielded questions on.
t1_dtimrtl	1	*	Most people don't like whiners.  Or worse, whiners that are also bullies.  Whiners turn people against their cause, not towards it.    
t1_dthjrgg	0	*	But that is the problem right there. Can you honestly think that the people working in educational positions and and the ones who decides the curriculum believe in a zero-sum game? 
t1_dthmnih	1	*	And the only reason he had to believe that he was good at everything was that he thought he was a good speaker...
t1_dtix589	1	*	...he says, still not knowing the difference between 2017 and 2018.
t1_dthlmkq	0	*	Who said I have a problem with Obama golfing? Just pointed out that for a group of people who complain about how much Trump golfs it's stupid to also question his health.

t1_dti78gi	1	*	Not being American I don't really have a dog in this fight. But Dubya did invade 2 countries I would say that makes him more of a war hawk than a bloke lending tactical aid to his allies.

t1_dthjtma	1	*	There was not proof though.  
t1_dthvd33	1	*	You said democrats 100% vote along party lines in response to me saying most democrats did not. Thanks for clarifying now, but I'm not somehow illiterate for thinking you meant what you said.
t1_dth9t54	0	*	Why don't you go do your BAD THINK somewhere else where I don't have to see it and be forced to think!

t1_dthedfl	1	*	Repeating bullshit leftist talking points that have no basis in reality is a hissy fit in my opinion. 
t1_dthfq7l	0	*	No I haven't.  You accused me of saying things about you that I haven't, then followed it with insults.  Guess you've made an ass out of yourself again.  again.  
t1_dthnff6	1	*	No, they did, they just wanted you to e l a b e r a t e which is very different to literally saying the same thing again.
t1_dthjexy	0	*	It's debateable. It just seemed like you were saying MSM doesn't ever get stuff wrong.
t1_dthgw5c	1	*	Trump is the dumb persons idea of a smart person. He in incredibly confident in everything he says (no matter how much he is lying to your face) so dumbasses believe him. 
t1_dthkdic	0	*	Liberals make my brain hurt
t1_dthll7v	0	*	Because I don't see your point. If he's done nothing illegal, why do you still want him out?

t1_dtgj1ww	1	*	It's against Trump, that number should be way higher.
t1_dthsixv	0	*	I'm no fan of the CIA/NSA and others but let's be honest here: they're infinitely more trustworthy and reputable than Trump and his administration.

t1_dtgn8l0	0	*	And you cant seriously be trying to paint Putin as a good guy. He assassinates opposition and straight up ANNEXED part of Ukraine. He's a scumbag thug and the world would be better off without him
t1_dtggj11	1	*	Dont need a putter in this game...
t1_dthz7i6	0	*	Nor did I ever say Putin was more trustworthy to our intelligence communities. They are both pure liars. If you believe either one of them you're a complete fool.
t1_dtgph1k	1	*	Good thing the special counsel is not part of his voter base.
t1_dtgjdtu	0	*	America and France are REPUBLICS, every time i hear college tards talking about democracy it really makes me cringe, politics for you guys are all about feelings.

t1_dth8qi5	1	*	Well, I agree. 
t1_dtgpmrp	1	*	What about you? You didn't answer his question either? 
t1_dtgj59c	1	*	Gerrymandering doesn't do anything about the presidential electorate. You can't gerrymander the presidential election. It does however affect the state run races for legislatures.
t1_dti143d	0	*	If you saw the video then the rational decision in a two party system is to dismiss the third party candidate.

t1_dth9qsm	0	*	You clearly have no idea what you're talking about if you think Ancaps are hard lefters.  An-Caps are hard right-wingers. They will tell you that themselves. Go ask them in r/AnarchoCapitalism
t1_dtgot99	1	*	I want your optimism so bad. But you're from a land where people actually rally behind democracy. Whereas we have... Trump supporters...
t1_dtgpgxo	1	*	Youre right, thats the rapist Wyrnn and the Koch brothers doing the funding.      Obama never funded antifa as well.  Funny you left that out.  
t1_dtgqepp	1	*	Pardon my ignorance, but I thought Soros was an investor and he's not actually a politician?
t1_dtgj1kt	1	*	They know how the system works. 
t1_dtgt4qd	1	*	Can you tell me about those popular Republican buzzwords while we're on the subject?
t1_dtgi1s2	1	*	And I keep being surprised by how America seemingly don't.
t1_dtgmn2k	0	*	A foreign enemy and 30 years of Republican bullshit conspiracy theories and lies. She was only a bad candidate because decades of slander convinced everyone she was a bad candidate.
t1_dth7s0x	0	*	To say that there is no liberal media is incomprehensible and frankly anyone who agrees is not worth discussing anything with. Call me anything you want, doesn't change facts. 
t1_dtgmry2	0	*	In other words no, you don't have anything to say about Obama not being pro-corporate. Just go back to your partisan hole and let people with critical thinking skills lead their discussions in peace.
t1_dtgjzih	0	*	Not all law is tort law. There are no specific personal damages from an individual instance of an insider trade either. Or speeding, or drinking and driving, assuming the driver was lucky.
t1_dtgki8w	1	*	Because those are the true Christian values. And every time i point to it people downvote me.  People must understanding that interpretation means nothing, what's written is what's written

t1_dtgiupl	1	*	So, go get those votes. Dems used to pick those votes up pretty easily. Look back at the states Bill Clinton won vs the states Hillary won.
t1_dth2375	0	*	Do you need someone decapitated?
t1_dthafup	0	*	Can't decide if you're a hopelessly naive pacifist/isolationist, or a right-wing nationalist sympathizer.
t1_dtggtuf	1	*	Where were you, when Republicans were trying desperately to convince people to vote for Moore even after the allegations with actual proof and non-anonymous sources?
t1_dthl55i	0	*	Nah I learned a long time ago you can't get someone to see something they don't want to see
t1_dtgnlde	0	*	It's hard to take you seriously when you call people brainwashed and unable to form a rational thought when you yourself cannot even spell correctly.

t1_dtgmt7b	0	*	Or you could take it as what I said.  But you won't, because arguments and opinions on Reddit don't matter, yours and mine included.  No worries mate
t1_dtgwkcy	1	*	>Bernie can predict future  Uh... You obviously haven't been paying attention to all the times he's been demonstrably ***correct*** over the last, uh, 40 years or so.
t1_dth4imj	0	*	You'd think 81% the party that controls all three branches of government would be more than 81/2=41% of everyone but I guess whatever
t1_dtgybcb	0	*	Every single thing possible points to Trump being traitor, and their is not one single bit of evidence suggesting he is not.
t1_dtgifkr	1	*	Better to die on your feet than live with wacky tictacs
t1_dtgkzf0	1	*	The electoral college isnt gerrymandering. Its designed to protect the states. The same reason we have a senate.

t1_du9pe77	0	*	I'm glad that you're honest enough to admit that you care more about the reputation of dictators than denying your callous view that abused Filipino maids should be used as political fodder.

t1_dtugbkh	0	*	Yeah, even if I don't agree with everything he says, I'd still like his party to couple of seats as well. More perspective on things would definitely stimulate some kinda discussion.

t1_dupj0d6	0	*	You are indeed punishing people that had nothing to do with the genocide. You can't help the Armenians *without* punishing modern day Turks who had no hand in the suffering.
t1_dup62qu	0	*	Comparing yourself to Turkey now? Your standard is so low?  You should work for an African family for free and your son and grandson too. This is how horribly you treated Africans for centuries.

t1_duwngot	1	*	You got it!
t1_dux1vtt	1	*	Not at all. I'm implying that, while a 4 year degree does not guarantee a $50k a year job, it's a non-negligible requirement. Doctors go to school for far longer and I never implied differently.

t1_dux0ni2	1	*	No. But I kept seeing how good you'll feel and what it will do for your resume comments. I knew I was taking an unpopular stance, and I'd collect buckets of downvotes. It was worth it.
t1_dtjv1kd	0	*	  Because 3200 acres, plus military installations is equivalent to 120 acres with a lighthouse.  Says you.

t1_dt1usn0	0	*	>The capitalists are still going to murdered en masse though either way  I too think all bakers should be murdered. /s
t1_dt3o4il	1	*	When the choice is between your own education or the health of your siblings or parents, it's not much of a choice. 
t1_dt36dee	1	*	:C
t1_dt1un8s	1	*	Nah, the government just taxes the shit out of them to encourage quitting as opposed to not wanting to tax the rich
t1_dt6ax0i	0	*	i never said that we need more subsidies, i said more efficient utilisation of them is needed
t1_dt3ybi9	1	*	Yea, sorry if I misrepresented how easy it was. 
t1_dt21t6h	1	*	There seems to be a lack of understanding here in raising the standard of living and purchasing power of the average person. The rich get richer but at what cost to society?
t1_dt2noyh	1	*	Just teacher thankfully, was my high school economics class 
t1_dt1v6zn	0	*	Youre telling me that less than 10% of people over 65 are able to retire? Then why dont I see them every working anywhere. 
t1_dt1y621	1	*	Roll your own? It tends to be cheaper
t1_dtn9b6l	1	*	Trust me   I know how you feel.  Reality seems to be so damn hard to find.  The phrase reality is nothing,  perception is everything.    Seems to rule.
t1_dudi4h3	0	*	Deriving absolutes from any statement in this context is silly. The chances of needing to defend yourself here are significantly lower, to the point of not needing a gun.
t1_dshrjg3	1	*	I was expecting more details and instances. Any book which I can read and find out more?
t1_dujp8ao	1	*	jeezus christ how do you have the time to be in nearly every comment thread on worldnews? lol
t1_dsmgwb7	1	*	Sorry, should've been more clear. You're right in your statement, but the overall argument that the US is between Norway and Haiti is not incorrect.
t1_dsl8usz	0	*	I am more saying that accounts like his are not there to arrive at solutions but rather to stoke division in the US and push for pro Trump agendas.  He is a bullet and not the wielder of a gun. 
t1_dsl2gtv	0	*	Trump is the POTUS whether your like it or not.  >Unless... you feel anything that upsets Trump Leader is treason?  No but exposing anything that makes the country look bad is.
t1_dsl4z0m	0	*	He understands the point of an immigration system--to help the host nation. It's not a charity program. Seems like most still don't get it, so at least he gets that.
t1_duhp1vu	1	*	Thanks
t1_duhci7x	1	*	As an American totally agree with you, our government was only there for oil and greed. We definitely let ISIS in and didnt give a fuck 
t1_duizhu1	0	*	ISIS does gruesome public executions.   Seems like you and ISIS guys would get along great.
t1_duh26pa	0	*	>proceeded to call us goat-fucking savages.  Do you guys not fuck goats then?
t1_duha0mg	1	*	Yeah every Iraqi Ive met is not too happy about American involvement. Even damn near hostile for bringing up the subject 
t1_dssoxfg	1	*	Fuck, that was one of the advantages of acid. You knew it was not adulterated.
t1_dskaohq	0	*	trying to piss with morning wood still in effect
t1_dskp5y6	1	*	Thats basically a mixture of high Bs and low As.
t1_dski0bi	0	*	What's the point in a currency you can't use?
t1_dskpr2r	0	*	Im only advocating not enforcing. Theres a difference. 
t1_dslchmr	0	*	I'm not sure what you're asking me.
t1_dsixt3d	1	*	I'm not familiar with it - perhaps?
t1_duj4rf6	1	*	The power of marketing
t1_dukxhd7	1	*	Exactly. The friends I mentioned would back me up in an instant. Being comfortable enough to take a joke is important.
t1_duj6jbn	1	*	Shhhh...shhhh...ssshhhillllllll.
t1_duj8p97	1	*	Perhaps. I hated how I looked with a short hair though so it just felt natural to let it grow out. Turned out I quite like having long hair, so I just let it be until my joke (nearly) became reality.
t1_duk67sq	0	*	They have opposing agendas on some things.  I didn't say they were the same, just that they have the same people/companies pulling the strings for war.  
t1_duj4cv8	1	*	Hey don't go away *now*... I'm waiting to see what you can desperately grasp for next... ha!
t1_duj8yqh	0	*	You don't even wanna hear about how crazy the second time was.
t1_duj117t	0	*	Yeah, just like gun control. Lets be nice to everyone. Just like the 2016 election.
t1_duj39i1	0	*	The key difference is that I don't have putin's cock cumming down my throat.
t1_duj6pa2	1	*	Nah. That's the most gay it can get. Feminine AND penis. 
t1_duk5jsm	1	*	No, I don't. And you wouldn't know it either, how could you possibly know that? Your personal flawed, unscientific, and clearly biased observations? Please.   
t1_dujchrr	1	*	Second time he poured cement into a block with him inside instead and hopped into a river.
t1_dukjix8	0	*	There's not a single nation on this planet without racist/xenophobic tendencies. But everything is relative. And *relative* to the absolute majority of countries, Russia has no racism issues.
t1_dujlcrh	1	*	This seems more about you than anything else.  Which is a waste of time for everyone.  Laters
t1_duj5xnr	0	*	Got any sources? That's a pretty wild thing to read.
t1_duj5ny3	1	*	I've honestly stopped reading anything you are saying at this point. It's all about you anyhow I bet.. or some shit about me. Not the topic at hand.
t1_dujs4tj	0	*	I don't know. All I can do is share my experience and hope it educates some ignorant people. Seems like your bent on maintaining status quo.
t1_duj8gh5	1	*	From my point of view the laws are wrong!
t1_dujdarj	1	*	technically correct is best correct
t1_dujaklf	0	*	Right, and of course there is a source for this? 
t1_dujvve4	1	*	Your roommate didn't like his new haircut, so he set fire to his entire head.
t1_duivter	1	*	Unironically no u.
t1_dujjynj	1	*	Man, playing the pedantic game is annoying. I understand your larger point you were trying to make. The others here just want to argue.
t1_duj8cz8	1	*	You're welcome. Yeah it can get confusing. 
t1_dujat71	1	*	The US has always been pretty shitty though. 
t1_duj6bh8	0	*	[citation needed]
t1_dujucn5	1	*	Oh my fucking god
t1_duj8djd	1	*	that's an excellent point good sir that I forgot about, when they signed the peace agreement they gave quite a huge chunk of land away. 
t1_dukpk2f	0	*	Its more of an internet slang thing that something you say out loud lol
t1_dul5pr3	0	*	Ya, glad you see that Trump's incompetencies are the main thing keeping him from going full Napoleon
t1_dujhwc4	1	*	Nothing I can do, eh? Watch me spout vitriol on the internet! Hah! Showed you!
t1_duj6bus	1	*	That's fair. Thanks for your input!
t1_duj5uu2	1	*	Literally any other.
t1_duj5eut	0	*	Are the two really that different? If you look at historical examples of racial discrimination you'll find that stereotyping goes hand in hand with discrimination
t1_dujuxpb	1	*	Wow, you got the point! ;)
t1_dul1hcu	0	*	They are saying if the wrong person is elected, those things will happen. Why are you defending russian propaganda? are you a russian bot?
t1_duj1pul	0	*	So funny when people use socialist as an insult too. Like yeah, I do think everyone should be taken care of. Thanks for noticing 
t1_duj8cnm	0	*	smart
t1_dujtuz4	0	*	Being ignorant about the medical indications of HRT unfortunately isn't trolling, it's common.
t1_duj8wvt	1	*	Lol yeah, I was gonna say that. Show me a good song by Rihanna and I'll show you a song Sia should've kept for herself.
t1_dujz2tl	1	*	People dont call Brazil a racist country but the same things you said happen here, so it is not like russia is number 1 racist country, you probably dont know saudi arabia.
t1_duj61d4	0	*	lets play tummy sticks. but no homo 
t1_duizmno	0	*	there was no alt right 10 years ago. 
t1_duj6i7s	0	*	Huh? Bush didn't have any to raid? Just read the article my dude. Lmao
t1_dutf2xo	0	*	I was exactly just like that. Now i`m at self actualization. Can you think recursively? And when big picture is in your head, people tell you youre so chaotic, and dont make any sense?
t1_duj217u	0	*	No need to blame Russia for this. Plenty of people from other countries are transphobic.
t1_duj6edv	0	*	Lol k.
t1_dujb5k0	1	*	Yep, coke is much better than diet coke for [keeping thin](http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/health-news/cocaine-users-thinner-because-drug-alters-metabolism-8754836.html).
t1_duj7ltr	1	*	>  both sides didn't achieved success  Yeah no, Manafort, Gates and Papadopoulus beg to differ.
t1_duj1v1u	0	*	Dude, Russian democracy doesn't exist, this is established fact
t1_duj799u	1	*	lmao how high is your blood pressure rn?
t1_duj77n2	0	*	And early intervention so they don't have to suffer through the wrong puberty. 
t1_dukfqkp	0	*	Well youre saying one is worse than the other...
t1_duj7yvz	1	*	She was investigated. And now she's being investigated again, for no fucking reason, because she was already cleared of wrongdoing. 
t1_duj3j5s	0	*	At least we dont have to write what our handlers tell us to. 
t1_duj63a7	0	*	Nobody asked for yours either. Do you always turn to insults when someone disagrees with You? It makes you look quite pathetic.
t1_dukau12	1	*	I'd rather have the cosmo, since we're being honest here! Not a fan of beer, really. I'd rather drink pretty much anything else (besides gin~)...
t1_dujtd0h	0	*	i do and those comments are only about 5% of the actual comments. When i say mostly gone i mean that it is about 80% less than when the internet first came around
t1_duj31ih	0	*	Uh, Shakespeare?
t1_duj6fk9	1	*	I like your style. Happy cake day. 
t1_duj5w73	0	*	> openly gay Orthodox religious groups  I don't think this will happen in this century. There is yet a distinct lack of non-religious openly gay groups.
t1_duk8gyz	1	*	It was a stereotype. Negative is your subjective opinion of it. 
t1_duj67st	0	*	Are you suggesting that 20 years ago Democrats idolized Saudi Arabia and Russia?
t1_duj65nm	1	*	Not really, but Iconodule can be pretty gross (kissing icons in churches).
t1_duj5uta	0	*	idk what the greatest showman is but this sounds like a really stupid burn
t1_duj5ue0	1	*	I haven't but I did hear that it was good
t1_dukdlcj	0	*	Sure, I think some people are not treated the same by the law. That is a bad thing. The solution to that is not vigilante justice, which would be way worse.
t1_duj3sqm	0	*	Then surely saying you guys voted is also irrelevant. We voted; it doesn't matter. Why bring it up? We didn't vote him in. 
t1_dut7prt	0	*	The facts you are stating show that you are an antisemite.
t1_dv55bds	0	*	No other option.  I am not a billionaire with multiple shares, friends with people who make policy giving me the heads-up. Nothing I can do other than inform others of what I read.
t1_dv5rc6m	0	*	Go research what happened when Bush did the same thing. For your own sake
t1_dv5s81m	1	*	It's not my economy that will suffer. 
t1_dv5bi4a	0	*	A source you could provide would be appreciated.  I see $925 Million a few years ago.  The difference is that Microsoft is going strong; Gates is a generous person that donates.  Ichan?
t1_ds5ry48	0	*	US poor is 3rd world middle class. Poor people are some of the most wholesome and grounded I've met. They appreciate the little things in life. You would do well to learn from them.
t1_ds7603f	0	*	Any decent academic tries to engage and debate with others, not boast about their degree, or tell the other person how they're shitting over their field... 
t1_ds628bp	0	*	Plato and Kierkegaard, mostly.
t1_dsf33n2	0	*	Are you determined to just autistically stalk my comments bro
t1_ds72th5	1	*	Lmaooo
t1_dtu87c9	0	*	Oh yeah, let's take that one example from the 70 others that do show bias. 
t1_dttlrs4	0	*	That was years ago and muslim terrorism is alive and well today. The Chinese can't have muslims in their society or else they will turn it into a shithole just like Europe is today.
t1_dtu8www	0	*	Without a doubt
t1_dttz1nv	0	*	i suppose i should have highlighted the 'never return' part  clearly, people are being taken and interrogated for long periods of time.  it's the ominous 'never return' part though i'm questioning.  
t1_dur014d	1	*	Dont know why you brought up Russias nukes like it would matter
t1_dtmrv31	1	*	And?
t1_dum6d15	0	*	Again it doesnt matter when the russian bots are doing the same shit for liberals as stated by Mueller.
t1_dswgyex	1	*	Yeah buddy.  It's THAT simple.  You're fucking delusional.
t1_dsxiz84	0	*	Youre literally arguing about nothing
t1_dsw1lyv	0	*	It is necessary to create another wallet with a different address for Bitcoin Cash?
t1_dswq8nm	1	*	yah, I know. . . I just assumed I'd be able to spell it, and thought it was a little funny when I tried for the first time.
t1_dsvvmir	0	*	The great depression began in 1929 while the new deals policies didn't start getting enacted until 1933. Don't bother responding, I don't argue with people who lack fundamental history.
t1_dsxd2g6	1	*	Lmao, omg you seriously have to get the hell out of the basement once in a while. 
t1_dswh67v	0	*	And how do you propose they fight back when they don't even have enough food to survive?
t1_dubywgk	0	*	Your first reply is legal consequences .. so no, Im not mistaking you for someone else. You are the only person on this entire thread who thinks (or at least thought) there was a law against sex.
t1_dsut67a	0	*	Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.
t1_dsuw2gh	0	*	O&G work will come to an end soon or later, man (more likely sooner).  Im also in the O&G field and everyone knows this: fossil fuels arent good.
t1_dsuur6o	1	*	Yes, he would be racist based on everything he has said and done. And because he's racist he would never do that...
t1_dsv8anj	0	*	But the ban wasnt a trial period was it? It was whilst they figured out how to improve the visa process. There was no need for the ban to exist to figure that out so surely they have by now?  
t1_dsvjmcl	0	*	Downvoted for asking for data from a dipshit
t1_dsuxdrv	0	*	Or maybe you are making huge logical leaps to justify your racist bogeyman narrative. Get some solid proof and I will agree with you.
t1_dsuufsz	0	*	Copy that, gonna go watch Happy anyhow.    Thanks buddy.
t1_dsutdnr	0	*	Yeah I'm aware. I'm a Chicago electrician. What are you talking about? I never said electricians in Chicago don't make good money.
t1_dsuwwl0	0	*	Did you only start paying attention to the dow when trump gor intp office? Its been on the rise since the bail out.  Think critically, man, stop being a parrot.
t1_dsvzyrg	0	*	Yeah, great response. You implied a place is a shit hole and defended the racist actions of Trump
t1_dsuv5jc	0	*	> How much food that can be farmed in the U.S. do you think is imported here?  Enough that *allegedly* importing food is causing farmers to struggle. 
t1_dsvedq7	0	*	I was going to stop but since Ive got an investigative journalist documenting my every move guess hows my time in the spotlight. Traps. Are. Gay.
t1_dsuywr4	0	*	Get arrested for driving without a license, get deported when in the us illegally.  
t1_dsv05xq	1	*	In an immigrant population with a 40% fraud or overstay rate, what number would become intolerable to you? 
t1_dsv1ozv	0	*	They're like grapes
t1_dsuwm54	0	*	Because theyre poor
t1_dsv2nm7	1	*	Oh, so you actually don't. To be frank you're strawmanning up the political opposition with buzzwords that quite obviously come from propaganda put forth from your team.
t1_dsv4lvb	0	*	You think everyone is nazis and the klan. 
t1_dsuugu5	0	*	No I don't I never said that, the guy saying Mexicans are uneducated and white people aren't is.  I mean you can pretend that didn't happen but lol it did...  It did! 
t1_dsw27yz	0	*	That was a typo actually.   Do not think = do you not think. 
t1_dsxbp6x	1	*	Yeah but so far no one was unwilling to accept paying better wages for those jobs in this argument thread.
t1_dsvvxbd	1	*	So then we don't need worker laws? 
t1_dsv0c6c	1	*	Quotes from famous individuals should not be how a society defines its policy. Just because someone is president doesn't mean that what they speak is gospel, just look at Trump.
t1_dsv4er9	1	*	Considering you dont know what a settlement is, thats a mighty big rock for you to be throwing 
t1_dsuwems	1	*	America's problems with literacy rates are more to do with your education system than 50-60 annual temp workers from Haiti.
t1_dsutvh2	0	*	who said they are?
t1_dsush2n	0	*	Please see my post below
t1_dsv7ks8	1	*	How about zero. 
t1_dsv9nej	0	*	......sounds like hypocrisy to me.
t1_dsutzb3	1	*	She was a terrible candidate.
t1_dsuv6cz	1	*	I included bold, if it's too much. I'm making a pretty controversial point, so I wanted to make sure there was context. Not everyone really knows about this, and it's very relevant. 
t1_dsv7yam	0	*	Jobs getting outsourced doesn't mean that unions are to blame. None of those sources said unionization was to blame. Manufacturing has been declining in America for decades it's nothing new
t1_dsuyrb2	1	*	What is it you know?!
t1_dsv55q1	1	*	Mestizo apparently. I didn't even know that was a thing.

t1_dsush86	0	*	Guess I'll have to do some research and find out.
t1_dsv0nji	0	*	You could call them something snappy and marketable, like some sort of unique ice-phase precipitation 
t1_dsuv759	0	*	You are the absolute embodiment of the Dunning Kruger effect.
t1_dsut4z2	0	*	No one thinks that, and the wealthy aren't the only ones who only have health insurance. What he's saying is why the fuck would we import people just to pay for their health insurance.
t1_dsyocbr	1	*	If you once read a source, then you should probably provide it. Ive already posted five.
t1_dsuv6vv	0	*	Source for what? I didn't state any facts.
t1_dsv7fgk	1	*	I love that guy's channel. I just recently made the cheese fritters recipe and they turned out amazing.
t1_dsv3ifs	0	*	And you didn't read the question. Ones entering in cars or via ports don't count as a wall does nothing about them. Only ones that cross illegally over our southern border. 
t1_dsvek7y	0	*	Emotions play a big part in what people think about things, its why people use it Dr. Large Brain.
t1_dsutsfj	0	*	And your answer is to just let it happen? They are evading taxes, thats a crime
t1_dsvavam	0	*	What a tiny world you must live in. 
t1_dsustkm	0	*	lol np?
t1_dsuunlb	1	*	You should either study your immigration policy, or the definition of liberal, because you are not correct. 
t1_dsuukp0	1	*	Did you just assume my gender tho U0001f914U0001f914U0001f914
t1_dsuusf3	0	*	What are you even talking about? Go look at actual country's web pages, no clue what you're going on about with alt right and image forums.
t1_dsv5yhp	0	*	We dont need unskilled labor, rural Americans need to get with the times, also we need unskilled labor to keep food prices artificially low.
t1_dsx50d9	0	*	We have hungry people including our vets because the rich refuse to pay their fucking taxes. That has nothing to do with immigration, bud.
t1_dsuwrlb	1	*	I was going picturing the borescope route. I suck at drones and the blades really up the pucker factor.
t1_dsvsz2c	0	*	Working visas are not a crime....
t1_dsw2uhi	1	*	It doesn't matter how many of anything there are. It matters how many that small number can get on their side. And which side are actual self-professed American Nazis and the KKK on right now?
t1_dsvvbb4	0	*	Rhode Island.  You commented like you knew what state I was talking about.
t1_dsutu3d	0	*	Good. Let companies start paying decent wages in agriculture and Americans will do the jobs. No one is picking fruit for $7 an hour unless you come from way worse living conditions.
t1_dsv4eqr	0	*	I'm not taking any sides here. I just thought your original comment was funny.
t1_dsus5xz	1	*	It's amazing how he thinks 20 families are nothing in the grand scheme of things but also a huge problem because they take all American jobs? Love it when someone contradicts themselves.
t1_dsux5xe	1	*	Exactly! Why does it feel like there are so few of us?
t1_dsv3vm5	1	*	Why are Canadians overstaying not a real problem, but Haitians are?
t1_dsvg9bn	0	*	I want to try it... But I think i might still have some faith in humanity that I don't want to loose :( 
t1_dsut70y	1	*	Better yet, lets not just leave a problem to be solved later.
t1_dsuzt06	0	*	Using that logic, the Democratic party is an outright anti-White hate group since they lost with every last White demographic except young women 18-25--a street works both ways
t1_dsv00hk	0	*	Trump himself called it the muslim ban, you're not fooling anyone
t1_dtxbwk8	0	*	You're talkin about *other people* being idiots and you just used the(completely nonexistent) word unproportional. You mean disproportional.  Go jump in a tire fire.

t1_dsutwfb	0	*	You think the anti immigration people wouldn't be happy with an e-verify law?
t1_dsuua4z	1	*	I have a question.  Were there any poor people in blue states when Obama was in power?  If you can only see things so black and white, I suggested you stay out of political discussion.
t1_dsutykl	1	*	That is a completely fair point, and I agree with you 100%.
t1_dsuxmmc	0	*	I was talking about immigration, not natives or people brought here unwillingly. Him mentioning them is a total non-sequitur.
t1_dsvsjzi	1	*	> I mean you can and you did  No, I didn't. I simply proved someone's absolute claim to be untrue.
t1_dsuulwq	0	*	Math skillz 
t1_dsutd5y	0	*	But we are talking about low skilled labor visas, they are legal immigrants.
t1_dsuscpy	1	*	It would be met more with confusion since their isn't any low skilled Norwegian immigrants here. I'd guess most Americans have never met a Norwegian in their life. 
t1_dsusgxx	1	*	Same high minimum wage for immigrants and citizens then.
t1_dsuyr5e	0	*	The article mentioned nothing about cost. Where are you getting that information?
t1_dsvk3k6	0	*	[This ](https://i.imgur.com/S2gCFoq.jpg) will not happen again just because you use chartered buses and call them invading hordes. NEXT! 
t1_dsvv8ci	0	*	Christ...were you homeschooled? Equating immigration with slavery and imperialism? Holding nothing sacred as a founding principal of this country... 
t1_dsuuhjo	1	*	Yeah, but the board likes to see that more then wages 
t1_dsvp0bq	0	*	South Africa gained independence from Great Britain in 1934, so I'm not quite sure what you're talking about.
t1_dsussee	0	*	So youre suggesting banning immigration from every single country, not just Haiti
t1_dsvf0o2	0	*	wow, what the everloving fuck are you smoking?
t1_dsv9rgm	1	*	Sources of what? Them not being refugees? Look at the number of people in Turkey, Iraq, Jordan, and Lebanon. Look at the definition of refugee 
t1_dsuun1b	0	*	I mean you already made up your mind so I'm not going to try to dissuade you any further.
t1_dsv5fnp	0	*	Let me educate you.  Yes they are temporary. The workers do the same thing immigrants do, send their checks home to mama.  Source = i've done these jobs.
t1_dsv9oto	1	*	Honestly I'd much rather trade a few million lazy hicks from the meth belt for low skilled workers who want to come here and work for a living. 
t1_dsv49op	0	*	Or changed the weather and stopped global warming?
t1_dsw5tsx	0	*	That's an interesting way to spin what I said.  I don't rely on a place my parents didn't birth me to allow me to work there. Nobody should.

t1_dswv2ua	0	*	I am one actually, just not in your employee hating country. Of course they should, do you want poor people to just die? Or just live of scraps provided by the government?
t1_dsuwzrb	0	*	Is Rachael Maddow not a liberal?
t1_dsuswqd	1	*	Well, as long as I'm getting messages filled with your bullshit I know someone else isn't. That's enough I guess.  Tell me some more. Don' hold back on me now.
t1_dsvmyo4	1	*	You're welcome.
t1_dsutlou	0	*	Wow. You relly want to live in the same appartment building as someone who uses unlicensed electricians?
t1_dsv2p72	1	*	thatsthejoke.jpg
t1_dsvuks0	1	*	That guy looks genuinely interested and excited to bring history and food to people, and then morons have to ruin it because they are so blind to reality.
t1_dsv5fw9	0	*	ok - no vetting in the church or gym? Just anyone allowed in?
t1_dsutnwm	0	*	That.. that isnt what they wrote at all
t1_dsut2ym	1	*	Well yeah but if I was told I could prevent 2 people from dying or a million I think you know which one Im choosing. 
t1_dswgelt	1	*	You know jack shit about history. They freedom themselves and did...oh fuckn up everything while the other half of the island did ok.
t1_dsutrzp	0	*	I literally just said the job pays complete ass and we take advantage of people. 
t1_dsuzcvf	0	*	Sounds good, man. Whenever you can explain to me why Californian ag laborers are overwhelmingly undocumented workers, I wound love to hear it.
t1_dsutuf3	0	*	National socialism is the answer, kaiser.
t1_dsuu3hb	0	*	> Saying it's wrong to ban black people  what the hell? who said this? Think you're just making things up now.
t1_dsv6yzu	0	*	It's been 400 years since America became independent, get over it
t1_dsuz0r0	1	*	People seem to think bankruptcy is failure to a mogul like Trump. It is just a financial move for him lmao.
t1_dsva24d	0	*	Better actively aggravating a hostile power than colluding with it against our own countrymen. But then, having some decency and loyalty is the difference between today's parties. 
t1_dsuv2qi	0	*	Where the fuck did you get the idea that welfare is available for illegals? We already don't give it to them. Who is changing this policy again? 
t1_dsuw2qa	0	*	I didn't say change political parties, I said change your political views.  How can you claim consistency when you voted for Obama AND Trump? Hillary was closer to Obama policy wise.
t1_dsut9ib	1	*	Go for it.
t1_dsvabxe	1	*	Aaaahahahaha! Harmony. Whew, Jesus wept, you people are a hoot. The country overwhelmingly electing a black president really did send y'all over the deep end, didn't it?  
t1_dsvukwt	1	*	Pattern recognition tends to be a skill even toddlers can pick up.
t1_dt17gca	0	*	Go back to T_D you degenerate.
t1_dsv4qp3	0	*	Yes, and in an ideal world we could.
t1_dsv67qe	0	*	That would still be a symptom. Treating the disease would be figuring out why there are jobs that are essential to our society that don't pay enough to make people want to do them. 
t1_dsuv0ng	1	*	You're right I completely misread the comment. 
t1_dt3tihr	1	*	 Sometimes you have to start from the bottom to get experience. I've worked shitty jobs before but then gained some work experience and moved up.
t1_dsutb0f	1	*	A very good point. I bet they don't catch the majority of people coming over
t1_dsuxykm	0	*	Its about supply and demand. It wasn't meant in a literal sense. You cant strike with oversupply without relying on borderline terrorism.
t1_dsuusec	1	*	Did I say that?   Quite the straw man you put together there.    U0001f937U0001f3ffufe0f
t1_dsuruw4	0	*	No Id yell at them to give back the million dollars. 
t1_dsvabak	0	*	Again, you reveal you cant spell, which makes you probably even more unlikely to be qualified to judge this. I'm beginning to think you're just regular old deluded.
t1_dsv3qu9	1	*	But conservatives absolutely use identity politics as well. They may present it differently but it's not just one party or group that engages. 
t1_dsv3odn	0	*	Do you live in North Korea?
t1_dsv1iwe	0	*	Pathetic. 
t1_dsuv7eh	0	*	Weird. The past two girls I've dated have both been CSA workers who were so pasty pale that it was hilarious.
t1_dsv9m83	1	*	sounds like youre making assumptions....
t1_dsx3qwm	1	*	Meh, I don't feel like fighting today.   Big fan of Bergen. Favorite vacation every. Adopt me? 
t1_dsuv0nx	1	*	I feel exactly the same. Thoughtful and balanced debate is far too rare on Reddit (but even rarer elsewhere). 
t1_dsvh3ve	1	*	The super friendly dudes in Hamas you mean? What possible risk are those guys that always seem to have loud ticking clocks on them
t1_dsuvlvm	1	*	Yeah, he has some really fun videos
t1_dsuzfyr	0	*	Are you saying that people from the other locations are not smart and couldnt steal high paying jobs?
t1_dsvm33j	1	*	Early 2000s Nickelodeon is forever branded into my brain.
t1_dsv45vl	0	*	So we should pay everyone low wages, so we can create other low paying jobs that will then create other low paying jobs? 
t1_dsuryjn	1	*	It doesn't matter if he's cool with it or not because he'd be dead.  Just like it doesn't matter if those 20 Haitians get blocked or not because their not getting over here.  
t1_dsutfwn	0	*	Because Haitians constitute a substantial overstay risk with almost no chance of ever contributing positively to the country. The costs simply outweigh the benefits.
t1_dsv6k40	1	*	That would make more sense.  Nationwide [E-Verify](https://www.uscis.gov/e-verify/what-e-verify) is something that comes up a lot in conservative circles, and they're generally for it.
t1_dsv7bxn	1	*	You don't consider brown people Americans?
t1_dswl9ji	0	*	I'm open to information from all fronts. 
t1_dsuy2ka	1	*	I don't know. The problem is a lot of these problems are circular so fixing one creates another.
t1_dsuxh70	0	*	If you're gonna ask questions, actually read and respond to it rather than just say thanks for the essay when someone is willing to take the time to debate with you. 
t1_dsv9vxv	0	*	39% is not just 10 people. Again, it's not just Haiti. Please read the article and not the headline. 
t1_dsurkv6	0	*	Well obviously its not a direct impact but more workers means more competition and less pay. 
t1_dsutvb4	0	*	> Visa's are given out to legal immigrants  .... i don't think you know what a visa is.   if someone is already a legal immigrant, why would they need a visa?
t1_dsuud92	1	*	>Its mind boggling to me that you think only the wealthy should have access to healthcare.  who said that?
t1_dsw2szq	1	*	Me neither 
t1_dsuxuoi	0	*	Can you source this?
t1_dsvdtip	1	*	What? 
t1_dsv46qn	0	*	There is nothing to indicate the person I responded to or anyone else understands that race and nationality are different concepts.
t1_dsutlus	1	*	Holy shit, you're pretty much right. But I was looking for a comment with three explanation points and not four. NEXT!
t1_dsv20mj	0	*	What I find amusing is how both sides are adamant that the other is stupid/mislead/delusional/in another reality/sheltered/confused/hateful and racist.  Crazy shit. 
t1_dsv7rgf	1	*	It does seem like he's a bit permanently heartbroken. I feel so bad for him, he's literally the nicest person on the internet.
t1_dsw5ou1	0	*	And? It's extremely unproportional.
t1_dswqsbf	0	*	There is absolutely no way to determine that statistic. 
t1_dsv3bce	0	*	Please link them cause in 10min of googling I found nothing and I get paid to search for shit. Same for the IQ is mainly determined by biology not enviroment.
t1_dsv1hwz	0	*	Considering what?
t1_dsuuade	1	*	Hail yourself.
t1_dsv75te	0	*	Isn't that just an [appeal to authority](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/appeal-to-authority)?
t1_dsvbbcj	0	*	Lol now youre running to wikipedia. That's how you know you have no points of your own.
t1_dsuu7y2	0	*	The relevance of your username has changed somewhat since you joined Reddit.
t1_dsverh9	1	*	Typical Communist. 
t1_dsx05l0	0	*	lol ok so I will say again how about you address my arguments instead of if I like a politician! address the argument!
t1_dsuug2t	0	*	Well fuck, I'm dumb. I thought you would've made a direct reference and said the DOI and not the Constitution if you were referring to that incident.
t1_dsuupnm	0	*	So having a rally is more important than having effective policies?
t1_duiiney	0	*	Lmao says the stoner pot smoker. You should be jailed for breaking the law.
t1_dt631aw	0	*	Its literally how it has always been with the wall. 
t1_du9ko67	1	*	Why'd they kill Rajiv Gandhi? 
t1_dsvuyuj	0	*	Dude, Milo Yunoppolis said that gays should get back into the closet and he gets to speak at universities. 
t1_dswc8nm	0	*	And that has what to do with anything? Its not even an argument; its incoherent rambling that addresses absolutely nothing from my post. What exactly are you attempting to claim? 
t1_dsvo05d	0	*	Yes, and I disagreed with him on that. I think it was a dumb thing to say.
t1_dsv54tf	0	*	Nope. An answer would be nice.
t1_dsvd76n	0	*	I meant that I was young so I wasnt paying attention to politics. The assumption was just something Id always had. No idea why. Need to research points a little better before I make them. 
t1_dsxacvz	0	*	Feels, not reals, amirite?
t1_dsws49s	1	*	Where did i say a thing about MAGA as opposed to comparing bitcoin and the stock market in the last 5 posts?  I can see you're only in this to hate trump regardless of what we are talking about.
t1_dsx3i4a	0	*	sounds good, good luck with that
t1_dsvhklq	1	*	> yours allows more weight on public votes.  Your votes have the same wight, they are just arraanged in a very corrupt manner to favor former slaveowning states.  
t1_dsvz5bf	1	*	Disbelief there are consequences to action? It's open to interpretation, not everything is an attack. 
t1_dsvloow	0	*	> nonviolent  [bout that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0s8R_cGgvFY)
t1_dsvtluu	0	*	And Arkansas has parts that are worse than most third world countries. At least according to the UN. 
t1_dsvkohz	0	*	gotta have two to tango. I can't bring an argument against a wall.
t1_dsv4uen	0	*	He knows he's full of shit. He doesn't care because his feelings matter to him over objective truth. 
t1_dsvv4e6	0	*	It even says it right in your article: white genocide was meant to be satirical. The guy wasn't ACTUALLY ADVOCATING for white genocide
t1_dsv0l8v	0	*	What you are asking for is proof something doesnt exist.  Its like saying I need a source that god doesnt exist, where its actually nearly impossible to prove the non-existence of something
t1_dspmnrk	0	*	Every empire has a history of massacres. 
t1_dskiagz	0	*	Poem != Immigration policy

t1_dskvfux	0	*	Angela Merkel is a fantastic example of how not to be.
t1_dsl3uug	1	*	I'm not a republican. Independent
t1_dskohht	0	*	All of it. I see you know nothing about American history. That's okay. Republicans have been trying to rewrite it for years. 
t1_dskrf1v	1	*	I said we haven't always been our ideal. But patriots welcome all. 
t1_dskrfkn	1	*	Nope. I'm happy to know I was right about him

t1_du0ti6t	0	*	Nah, I'm not an idiot.
t1_du1ajgd	1	*	You understood me wrong. I'm libertarian, I do not believe in state control. They are free to go to those colleges, but I'm free to criticize and shit on their wage expectations. 
t1_du0w6i9	0	*	Im looking around for a good meta study on it but Im not having much luck.  Feel free to link me if you have anything good to share

t1_du149du	1	*	AND MY AXE!
t1_du1by59	1	*	Yeah, but I prefer the human contact, if something seems unreasonable or ridiculous Ill fact check, but otherwise as long as it seems reasonable it probably is, most people even provide sauces.

t1_dsx6xl5	0	*	They die participate. But at least they are recognizing the fact that there was a genocide, unlike the turks.
t1_dsx9vig	0	*	Would they ban Jewish or people of color if they could? Yep  But luckily they were not in a place of power.  But keep glorifying nazi's
t1_dsy31fm	1	*	whoops I'm illiterate
t1_dsyklss	0	*	That's correct 
t1_dsxlgld	0	*	That's still their fault though, simply because they were scared doesn't absolve them of hanging Poland out to dry. 
t1_dsy14at	1	*	Yes. Lost the battle on the continent, but not defeated... Hence why they were heavily involved in the war effort and the only thing stopping complete Nazi domination of Europe until America joined in
t1_dsxf5b7	0	*	Not in Europe
t1_dsx6e5y	0	*	We're not arguing, I'm correcting you. 
t1_dsyae7m	1	*	So was the congress he destroyed.   Also, the last elections weren't democratic. Maduro and Chavez took money to use on their campaigns.  Venezuela is as much of a democracy as Russia.
t1_dsy119t	0	*	> direct action  So, rioting and political violence?
t1_dsy2y2m	0	*	TIL that Al Qaeda was formed entirely from the Afghan Mujaheddin.  Or... WAT.

t1_dsgs74n	0	*	I'm on my phone at work, my apologies I can't watch the video right now. But am I wrong?
t1_dsgs80s	0	*	But it's possible. And that's what trials are for.
t1_dsguexl	0	*	Unless you have a source i dont, buddhist are NOT doing that shit in america. So why ban an otherwise peaceful people?
t1_dsgp662	0	*	That's just a civil war, not a Buddhist teaching. The Quran teaches oppressing gays and women. Apples and oranges.
t1_dsgtnwt	1	*	I was referring to the California situation, which is obviously a blue state.
t1_dsikfzq	0	*	I might be wrong but don't the British armed forces swear loyalty to the monarch?

t1_dsswj9z	1	*	Thanks, Farts
t1_dsskpda	0	*	It's almost as though there are wildly different interpretations, and to you a literal interpretation seems silly, and to others it seems reasonable. 
t1_dsslm5n	1	*	As a guess, it probably means holy, in the same way someone would say holy shit.

t1_dsslehe	0	*	henis
t1_dsslmxv	1	*	With 7.5Billion+ people its actually not surprising at all that some people are treated in such ways. People are assholes. 
t1_dst0uyc	1	*	Henry, obviously.
t1_dssy9ld	1	*	I'm pretty sure every scam ever has provided some small benefit or perceived benefit to their prey. It's how they are able to recruit new prey and retain old prey so easily.
t1_dssmw6v	1	*	Nailed it my dude 
t1_dssjowm	1	*	It has violent stuff, but mostly recounts of what became of early apostles or the book of Revelations, which is technically a recount of the future. 
t1_dssltyk	1	*	>and whatever you do, for the love of god do not look at /r/nomorals  I should have listened.
t1_dsskdym	0	*	It's a sentiment with most evangelicals across the globe sadly
t1_dssmimu	1	*	You got a license for that?
t1_dst822e	1	*	As opposed to Obama who let in hordes of ISIS members, right?
t1_dssszn7	1	*	Sorry bud, had to downvote cause of that last thing.....how?
t1_dsskefs	0	*	Im not sure. I saw it through Reddit. Link straight to live link, I didnt do much more research but it was one of the HD videos. It was cut like a movie trailer
t1_dssklna	0	*	Observing the Sabbath. Which kinda makes sense, since it's the one Jesus kept falling out with the pharisees after breaking. 
t1_dsss091	1	*	Absolutley. I had no intention of implying otherwise.

t1_dssqi0h	0	*	Hey I enjoyed TLJ too. There are at least two of us out here!
t1_dssk0rt	0	*	Sheltered.
t1_dssysmq	0	*	I was being hyperbolic in response to his use of the words directly  responsible. Im with you for sure.
t1_dssqwi1	1	*	I'm pretty sure the soundtrack is weird too; guy gets tortured to like, sweet child of mine and funkytown. What a way to go.
t1_dssp7vy	1	*	Statistically, in the US, around 55% of all non-Catholic Christians, and 65% of Catholics support gay marriage.  http://news.gallup.com/poll/210566/support-gay-marriage-edges-new-high.aspx

t1_dsszr67	0	*	For which one?

t1_dsslx54	1	*	That would be very unlikely.
t1_dsstan2	1	*	Sensitive?
t1_dssmlm7	0	*	Super ill? We'll need to hear your hip hop music tape and be the judge of that, mister. 
t1_dst0mch	1	*	I mean, it was (though, take this with a grain of salt as I haven't seen any other episode)
t1_dssq7o7	1	*	The more you slaughter animals the more desensitized you get to it.  
t1_dssmnw4	1	*	Sensitive or soft

t1_dssljxm	1	*	*hyenas
t1_dssn2vr	1	*	I like his spelling better.  Something about it just looks cool.
t1_dsskg8t	1	*	Well, if you ask anyone in western Kansas, they'd call it being a pussy. 
t1_dsswcow	1	*	Those two didn't seem that bad. Nomorals just seems edgy if anything. 
t1_dsslgm4	0	*	And people wonder why milennials don't buy diamonds. How could I when I know how they're sourced? I feel bad enough when I buy bananas and chocolate. 
t1_dssryd3	0	*	Morality isn't relative, those things are still objectively wrong. We just have subjective experiences of what is right and wrong
t1_dst3sd8	1	*	I mean, for most people yeah. Probably it was just as bad or worse for Kurds and other groups.
t1_dssq2ht	1	*	Yes.
t1_dssn6vp	0	*	Nothing habituates children to silence like misfortune - Victor Hugo author of Les Misxe9rables   Quite fitting in this context
t1_dssljvt	1	*	I don't know if his family and loved ones would feel the same, but I do think your awareness makes a difference.
t1_dssmxhg	0	*	I never said we should watch the video, just beating up an arrogant asshole that thinks they understand how everyone else thinks.  Fuck off.

t1_dssnwya	1	*	Or a video game (F.E.A.R. and Paxton Fettel)
t1_dst6w1y	1	*	Perfect source. How could I ever refute a fact so solidly backed up.   I'm gonna take a wild guess that you're not from the middle east. And that you kind of like Trump. How close am I? :) 
t1_dssr6yz	1	*	Naive to violence (can work)
t1_dsskt1j	1	*	Yeah, tis a silly thing.
t1_dssy1o6	0	*	The apparent willingness to be evil would be a good start. 
t1_dst5p2q	1	*	What, are you assuming if someone else was president they would welcome ISIS with open arms? 
t1_dssq9cj	0	*	I'm down voting you because you remind me of....me
t1_dsslchn	1	*	Can't tell if that was on purpose or not... 
t1_dssl2l2	1	*	Oh yeah, I understood the point and agree. At this point if I had to start killing my own food I wouldn't last long.
t1_dsskmwi	1	*	Sensitive or sensitize, which means to make sensitive
t1_dssojxn	1	*	The guy was fully aware of what's happening, that's the worst part.
t1_dssp7w8	1	*	You'd have to be incredibly lucky to be a crazy murderer who is completely open about their crimes. I figured you were military, or worked in the medical/death services (?) industry. 
t1_dssq1k6	1	*	Those are strictly minority views here.
t1_dssuzf3	1	*	Off with his head. We grammar Nazis need to be ruthless.
t1_dst4iu7	1	*	Lol wut got any legit sources on that or is that just what you were told
t1_dsxtbgf	0	*	So it's a bit less dense rather than a bit more dense. Still on the same order.
t1_dswrkvf	0	*	Are you from outer space?  Are you seriously asking me what happens to unemployed people?
t1_dswzj39	1	*	Don't forget that income tax in the Netherlands starts at 36.5% so take that into account. 
t1_dsvv43g	1	*	I am aware.
t1_dt4epst	1	*	Show me a source that proves Sweden has arrested Russian trolls. Until then **you don't have point**.
t1_dt4flk6	1	*	I dont think Sweden has been hypocritical here have they? This isnt about a US citizen, he is Swedish and they have every right to complain.

t1_dt41c7x	0	*	And now you have lost all semblance of sense. 
t1_dt427zo	0	*	Is that your projection talking?
t1_ds37bhw	0	*	Your position of granting credibility to people with every reason to lie, and no consequences for doing so is far worse. 
t1_dv0g90q	0	*	If no one assigns responsibility i'd agree, but it's far too common. I'm all for some political correctness for once.
t1_dtg9hnx	0	*	That guy is fuuuuuucked.
t1_dtg9jba	1	*	Geopolitical systems don't mature, they stabilize as conflicts are negotiated and smoothed over, power vacuums are filled, and complex networks of trade create rigid, aligned incentives. 
t1_dti5tmt	1	*	Thanks and good job.
t1_dtged4s	0	*	Apparently Chinese investors are ravaging the Seattle market because, compared to you guys, were still affordable.  O_O
t1_dtgaycz	0	*	We have basucally the same here.  Except they get paid the absolute minimum legally required per hour.  It's not a great system.
t1_dtg7rsn	0	*	If the geopolitical environment of a state is detrimental to its population then it should not supersede them. I care more about human beings then some intangible sense of statehood.
t1_dtg3rls	0	*	Im from the US, i specified it solely because were on r/worldnews. I wrote a paper for school a few years ago on the fairness doctrine and always appreciate seeing it talked about :)
t1_dth30c2	1	*	Our politicians should just have sex and seal the deal. 
t1_dtg5126	1	*	Theres a lot of hate in your heart. Another Russian trying to stir discourse I suppose. So many of them on Reddit today.
t1_dtgbgzj	0	*	Could be a case of crippling, crippling debts. And likely a little substance abuse, too; I'm thinking medical doctor. 
t1_dtgafsi	0	*	Its a feeling like survivors guilt.

t1_dtjaye2	0	*	I can name several states who tried to leave the union.  There was a war fought over it.
t1_dtge2b2	1	*	Vancouver native here, too. What a shit show. I love this city but foreign investment and greed are destroying its soul. 
t1_dtg4ji0	0	*	We were never meant to be a direct democracy, so...no?
t1_dtgbsg2	0	*	Lmao at the thought of needing a major in your native language to properly use basic grammar.
t1_dti7twr	0	*	Oh wow, the Kyoto Protocol? What year did we ratify that treaty?
t1_dtgws6e	0	*	No, literally the average student loan balance in america is around 30k: http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2017/08/24/5-facts-about-student-loans/
t1_dtgg0hx	1	*	I think they're just a little disappointed in Guthrie for letting that one through.
t1_dtgf7t9	1	*	UK here, God save our gracious housing market. 
t1_dtgan79	0	*	:) 
t1_dtgnq55	0	*	Sorry I worded my reply wrong and shouldn't have said cities, but I was refuting your claim that Scotland's population was pretty rural
t1_dtg69k5	1	*	Piss poor argument, considering the number of voters who don't have a clue about issues and only come out to show team spirit.
t1_dtgelxc	1	*	Well the UK also has multiple governments, Scotland has the Scottish Parliament. 
t1_dtg3e6t	1	*	you mean Romneycare?
t1_dtgf50r	0	*	Well in California, you can get a Job that pays $150k+ right out of college with just a bachelors degree.    What about Michigan?
t1_dtgfhrj	1	*	3$ for bread is already a lot. In France/Italy/spain with 3 euro you almost purchase the business. 
t1_dtgxixh	0	*	Fair enough, but it's still a stupid idea.  Democracy only really works when the populace is informed.  Otherwise, we just have a popularity contest.
t1_dtgllba	0	*	This is a natural problem with democracy though. How do we fix the stupidity of the average american?
t1_dtgd3ep	0	*	Don't worry, we're in another bubble and things will be back to normal soon enough.
t1_dtgn7lc	1	*	This is a stupid comment. I'm glad you like supporting your congressman's road to no where, I prefer the government cut waste and pork, to each their own I guess, champ.  
t1_dtghont	1	*	You forget the rent of the restaurant...
t1_dtm9jw2	1	*	If you're truly one of the best in the world at what you do then you should be able to find someone willing to pay you to do it *shrug* 
t1_dtgdk57	0	*	More of a I *deserve* to live in Vancouver thing.  You can buy a modest house for 300k in interior BC with a blue collar job that will net you 80k a year with nothing but a grade 12 education.
t1_dtgbzc6	1	*	The man has to brag
t1_dtg3jyw	1	*	I mean American Liberals are themselves pretty far right compared to  other European Liberals.
t1_dtg4fhe	0	*	Nope
t1_dtgutdt	0	*	It began in 2008 and ended prior to 2018... It is not relevant anymore. 
t1_dtg90xo	0	*	Or we could just use a popular vote system, like every other country. There's no point in only going halfway. 
t1_dthqedf	0	*	Why the heck would we want to do that?  If voters are dumb, giving them more power isn't going to help things.
t1_dtg6c0s	1	*	Yeah, it's kinda funny being lectured by a guy in rural Canada about how people in South Korea and Ghana view the US. It's really easy to look up unbiased polling from each year.
t1_dthk57i	1	*	Right?
t1_dtgei8x	0	*	It's not that expensive... Usually around $6-9. I live in the city.
t1_dtgec9w	0	*	That would be almost reasonable here in Germany because, you know, we have to import avocados, lol. But from what I know about San Francisco's climate, they don't have to import them right?
t1_dtggl4r	0	*	Yes they do...  And I'm saying that the only thing Trump BY HIMSELF can ruin for longer than the next presidency is America's reputation.
t1_dtg6a74	0	*	Piss poor argument, considering the number of voters who don't have a clue about issues and only come out to show team spirit.
t1_dtg8umj	0	*	What did he say?
t1_dtgavxj	0	*	In Michigan you can also get a house for like $50k, so the math works out
t1_dtge0cq	1	*	Well thank you for now motivating me in becoming more active in reddit.  I use other platforms but I think youve just spurred me on.  
t1_dtgf4ex	1	*	Oh, get a job? Just get a job? Why don't I strap on my job helmet and squeeze down into a job cannon, and fire off into job land, where jobs grow on jobbees!?
t1_dtg6ksv	1	*	Curiously, that didn't look like sources, just attacks. Dismissed.
t1_dtgewsb	1	*	these people are crazy.. join or war! yep... not totalitarian at all.
t1_dtgqnal	1	*	Same here in the UK...  Its almost like capitalism has failed.
t1_dtfwp9c	0	*	Buddy if you dont like agreeing with reputable sources get off reddit when it doesnt fit your bias agenda
t1_dtgcq80	1	*	As do I. I like the upcoming generation. They will have many opportunities that I'm slightly jealous of but genuinely happy they will have.
t1_dtgvdjo	0	*	About a year? Only a year? That's cute.
t1_dtfu02m	0	*	But its impossible to hold a legally binding referendum in the UK, no referendum has ever been legally binding. 
t1_dthbxw1	0	*	And that's why we're now keen to buy somewhere, so we can get a staffy.
t1_dth6omd	1	*	ok, I'll admit.  I miss normal eyebrows.  
t1_dtgb7x6	1	*	This comment is sort of ironic considering that the EU sort of wants to go to war with the UK over them leaving the EU. I'm not saying tanks and planes war, but definitely trade war. 
t1_dtg4bnk	1	*	That's right- it hasn't. I used England since the other guy was using it as a synonym for the UK.
t1_dtg6vji	0	*	Do you honestly think that's a fair parallel? 
t1_dthrj5l	1	*	French living in Canada, I can have a solution to buy in Montreal without bailing out.
t1_dtgg0oe	1	*	See my first post.
t1_dtgj8p0	0	*	Agism is okay in my book, old and young people suck, it's the ones in between that you want. 
t1_dthlpa8	0	*	So because a lot of young people on the internet from the US, UK and Australia feel this way means that there has to be a strict generational divide in Germany? I don't think it works that way.
t1_dtg4kon	0	*	Im glad someone gets it lol
t1_dtg8nfq	1	*	1993 to be exact. The HEART bill.
t1_dtg26lc	0	*	Lol and not voting, Bernie had no where near the support trump had, even with non voters being counted
t1_dtgg3kr	1	*	I think we'll actually head to Newcastle after Canberra (whenever we wind up leaving). We have friends living there and we quite like the city. 
t1_dtgea18	1	*	!redditsilver these people always forget that the UK doesn't just mean England, sigh.  *(yes I live in England)
t1_dtw8low	0	*	>You're not reading my comments, that's how you compiled my list of needless insults.  You are 100% certified /r/iamverysmart
t1_dtmji6b	1	*	That's what you get when you initially want to just say: you're idiotic. 
t1_dtm30ql	1	*	Thank you, and I agree.  Cryonics is a backstop, and it's not at all ideal, but the alternative is objectively worse.
t1_dtm618e	0	*	Oh my lord I am so dumb. That went right over my head. Sorry! Edited my comment
t1_dtm2g2j	1	*	We've evolved to do a lot of things we don't do anymore
t1_dtm2f61	1	*	And a serious tendency to die. May as well ditch them both at the same time. 
t1_dtm2e97	0	*	We evolve to feel a lot of things, doesn't mean we need to act on them.
t1_dtm58po	1	*	We've also evolved to die and we're talking about surpassing that at the moment if you'd bother to pay attention. 
t1_dtm3ext	1	*	Then let me be the fool to take that shot in the dark rather than quietly accept a decrepit end. To each, their own.
t1_dten8eb	0	*	You're really angry that the church has finally been told to fuck off.   Good.
t1_dteqxu0	1	*	Hahaha
t1_dttx6pz	0	*	Plenty of people are understanding of our impact on ecosystems. It isn't some big fucking mystery.
t1_dttx24k	0	*	Someone already explained it to you well, so I'll make this short and say to just re-read his comment.
t1_dtu4591	1	*	That's true, but society provides a pretty strong guarantee you won't be killed.  In that sense, people have a right to live guaranteed by society. 
t1_dtu3ona	0	*	If that story got loose w/o his approval I would be surprised.  I just looked, and there isn't an online version.  In short, the earth *is a very bleak place*. Nothing growing, howling wind, cold.
t1_dtug58p	0	*	Yes.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_state#List_of_current_states_described_as_communist
t1_dtu416c	1	*	:-)
t1_dttxlaw	1	*	Look at it this way. Tone doesnt translate well in internet comments. What may sound like an honest simple question in your head can easily sound like mocking derision to others.
t1_dtu80ji	0	*	Its the Reddit way. Most people would not say half the things they say on here in person. Everyone gets to be an Alpha on here because of anonymity 
t1_dttxhh6	0	*	No you fool, read the bloody article, it is a private twainese company, that the Vitnam government is protecting. 
t1_dttru4j	1	*	Absolutely, i was just showing what one man can accomplish. Sometimes it is easy to let the bad things overshadow the good. 
t1_dtv4ww8	0	*	Sorry man, didn't mean to get heavy on you
t1_dtu04k6	1	*	It's ready happening. Read about the acidification if the oceans.
t1_dtu10uv	1	*	Bad news, friend: we only have about 1 billion years before the oceans boil away. So right now it's like life's cramming for a final exam due in a few hours.
t1_dttxw1o	1	*	Is that a yes or no to his question?
t1_dtu47rm	1	*	No, just a rational person. 
t1_dtk60k5	0	*	Do you think artists should have a right to play where they choose?
t1_dtl2oep	0	*	So the application process is still open and people are still receiving citizenship    Yeah that definitely sounds like they're not being processed. 
t1_dtkpcg1	1	*	I imagine most people vote with what they believe in and not what will make them rich, although that probably weighs in.
t1_dtju23x	0	*	It is when you try to categorise  Netanyahu with a neo-nazi who endorses  an ethno state 
t1_dtl05hk	1	*	Or  /  depending.  :D   
t1_dtjwxd8	0	*	It's great considering I didn't vote in a government that immediately started committing acts of war against my insanely more powerful neighbour
t1_dufar8i	1	*	> The point of male circumcision is.. well, there is no real point to it.   Kellogg's beg to differ. 
t1_dulhlm6	0	*	That is the weakest appeal to authority I have ever seen.   'My sister's neighbour's cat was called Darwin, I win!'
t1_dug9jxp	1	*	> it doesn't mean that 25% of what people call FGM is a harmless pinprick.  Of course it doesn't, but that pinprick is still illegal.
t1_duf4e0b	0	*	And thats why at least male circ. was done in US
t1_duic3ky	1	*	And that means what to me? There should be no future of doing either.
t1_duhae6g	0	*	Defending circumcision helps one feel OK having had been circumcised oneself. 
t1_dufndis	1	*	Mate, youre just making yourself look stupid at this point
t1_dufo9wf	1	*	A typo does not mean the word used and the word it was mistaken for should have the same definition
t1_dufet9x	1	*	> while circumcision is seen as slightly positive  Wait what? Do people actually believe this in the US?
t1_dug53j3	0	*	Personally, it does look a bit better, but as I have had that explained to me. It's a regional thing, I have been conditioned to see it this way. I'm not a dumb person, just misinformed unfortunately.
t1_dsigp9t	0	*	Lol still a link to a google search.  The poster is asking to link to a meme that you think swung people's minds for voting.  By linking to millions you are running away from that question.
t1_dsrr7d8	0	*	Quick question.   How are they supposed to enforce the regulations?
t1_dsju5tk	0	*	:)
t1_dsir6k9	1	*	You're right, although that was not my meaning. I'll edit to reflect that, thanks. 
t1_dsipwzq	0	*	Kind of misleading to say the US is a two party system because voters make it so. FPTP is as much to blame for the two party system.
t1_dsiukga	0	*	monopoly on violence is just another way of describing government
t1_dsiv5oj	0	*	No, what you keep defining with your buzz phrase is a State. Not a government. Your proposed solution is still a form of government in spite of your refusal to believe it as such. 
t1_dskimmf	0	*	Well what do you think researchers who write those papers do?
t1_dsiiaib	1	*	Saying neither candidate was good is also not an objective statement and merely an opinion. 
t1_dsinwi8	1	*	Nice, thanks for both your comments. Makes much sense.
t1_dsjlkzk	0	*	Like? What would she have done? I already gave examples of what Trump has done. He already has blood on his hands. Give some concrete examples of why Hillary is worse.
t1_dsihxlq	0	*	> Youre putting out a baseless claim that one is worse than the other.  Except it's the opposite of baseless, and more and more are seeing it as an undeniable reality, whining no longer works.
t1_dtk0rqj	1	*	You gotta walk before you can crawl. 
t1_dtjjasn	0	*	You see how ignorant that statement is, don't you?
t1_dt34rnn	0	*	Now you're attempting to not call me dumb, but say my behavior is dumb, and then attempt to insult my comprehension. Oh my god you are so bad at this. 
t1_dsa1z8h	0	*	How is being in the SAS not real? Bear is as legit as anyone. The show is just a show, who cares.
t1_dsa7j4v	0	*	>what is the problem with doing it yourself   The problem is doing it for a tv show lol don't be obtuse just to win an argument
t1_dsa67mj	0	*	...so because you didn't remember the passage, that makes me a troll for referencing it? What are you smoking?

t1_ds9yhsl	0	*	Sure, enlighten me, I'd be interested in the facts, but I'd be more interested in finding out the source of your defensive, angry attitude.
t1_ds9z5u0	0	*	It can't be both? The TV show is about sending regular people out onto a tropical island with some basic survival training and seeing if they can survive for a few weeks.
t1_dsa68a1	0	*	Geez who pissed in your cheerios this morning?
t1_dsa3pdf	0	*	You don't think the millions of people that choose not to eat meat effect the market at all?
t1_dsbvo14	0	*	Yes, but what is the difference between killing for food and killing for entertainment when both are unnecessary?
t1_dsa7aw9	1	*	Does he says he definitely thinks it's Bigfoot?
t1_dsa9egw	0	*	Specifically, what privilege do I have that prevents people from not eating meat?
t1_dsab475	1	*	...I commend you on the depth of that joke.  Crap, normally I'm fast on the uptake for those.
t1_ds9xac5	0	*	There aren't any rewards in The Island, they do it just for the challenge. It's not like Survivor or Shipwrecked
t1_dsatjah	0	*	Uhhh why is Celine Dion on that list?
t1_dsado1n	0	*	Vegans are inconsistent. You completely ignore other social issues to defend 'animal rights'. You aren't socially conscious, you just avoid answering the tough questions.
t1_dsbhmxm	0	*	If you believe in psychics, do you believe the real psychics are not even tempted by James Randy's 1 million dollar reward?
t1_dsa655k	0	*	It's douchey to attack someone for no reason other than referencing a book. You are just looking to argue over nothing for the sake of arguing. Who on earth cares. 
t1_ds9yhjc	1	*	Link the source material anyway. I like Les and I'd like to read it.
t1_dsaej4l	0	*	The difference is that you wanted to, I don't so I'd easily cave to cravings. 
t1_dsasfk5	1	*	He's a 69 year old obese man with no drive to finish his series.  Odds are he won't finish it.
t1_ds9ytjs	0	*	Chris Jericho. Kenny Omega.  Bryan.  Adams.
t1_dsarlka	1	*	I mean... have you seen his progress so far? Read his blog? The man might as well be moving backwards in time trying to write the *second* to last book. He's not getting any younger.
t1_dtso1tl	1	*	No, it doesn't. Efficient at what? Time required to process claims against false transactions? Routing internationally or interbank? What about on weekends? Get a clue, man.
t1_dtfaln6	0	*	They also did not touch on the subject that legal changes are being investigated.
t1_dtet4t1	0	*	silly me, I forgot they really love those immigrants especially Muslims and Eastern European!
t1_dtn4cw4	0	*	Ok, but that's not what I'm asking. I'm asking is the dossier true or false, and why?
t1_dv1s9oi	1	*	The example that started this whole thread was specifically on blanket bans of foreigners, regardless of their actual proficiency in Japanese.
t1_duahuel	1	*	You don't want that hanging over you every year buddy trust me. 
t1_dub8tvw	1	*	Only a math student deals in absolutes 
t1_duabtj7	1	*	Fairy nuff.
t1_duat0fi	0	*	Yeah people shouldnt live in extreme poverty, living in a first world welfare state is a much better outcome even if you're completely useless in an information economy. 
t1_duanor7	0	*	We're a democracy and the country voiced its opinion , quicker we leave the better ( yes i voted to leave also )
t1_duabq40	1	*	Why are you? 
t1_dudu3ur	1	*	I've already explained why this is dumb as fuck
t1_duah35q	0	*	Either way though, it'll be a right-wing (to us) faux-religious prick with shitty foreign policy.
t1_duafdhb	0	*	Atleast you got excited for 5 mins though. That's something
t1_duae0jx	0	*	That's what I just said. 
t1_duadrzm	1	*	I *honestly* just had to Google it.  I hadn't heard of it at all.  I'm not sure why, but it seems a lot of that wasn't run around my area.
t1_duafvpz	0	*	Hydrogen, sulfur, and oxygen are a start, but you can't build with them. You need rocks, metals, that sort of stuff
t1_duaa1jp	0	*	I don't trust the people of this country with another referendum even if there is evidence that some have changed their minds. We should scrap the entire thing.
t1_duagevh	1	*	Thanks
t1_dub6pmm	1	*	If you actually had a political culture in the US you wouldn't be trapped with only those two. You would have diversity. A pillar of democracy. But you don't 
t1_ducnzd6	0	*	Shame for you that the voters in 2020 will attribute it to Trump, which is what really matters.
t1_duaipmt	0	*	Facts U0001f602  And to think you accused the other guy of lacking self-awareness! 
t1_duafvky	0	*	> being part of the single market does have significant economic benefits to balance it out.  What are they?

t1_dubsfkk	1	*	Hahahaahahahaha fucking idiot
t1_duae9k2	0	*	Warfare is pretty funny if a lot of people are doing it with you.
t1_duaifdl	0	*	Are you joking? If we had 0% growth thats a straight up recession/depression for the USA. 
t1_duabal2	1	*	The fact that you not only recognize it, but you openly admit it, is extremely commendable. People like you help fix the problem.
t1_duaaxa6	0	*	Because that's what you've been doing in this thread... And quite poorly as well
t1_dua9xsn	0	*	But whose fault is that? Besides, loads of Eastern European people are employed here as well. Doesn't stop us from innovating.
t1_ds39qdp	0	*	Then stop being an extremist? Jesus Christ....
t1_dv0bezx	1	*	Oh right. I forgot the workers party was not ok the left. My mistake of course
t1_duze7dt	0	*	But the *system* of government is not. It's like a damaged person: Even if they're wounded psychologically and physically, they are still a person.
t1_dtrt5qx	0	*	Yes, 65 years ago and our justice system is completely different these days - most notably the death sentence is now banned. Your case was three years ago. 
t1_dsto2h2	1	*	What does that have to do with what we're discussing exactly?...
t1_durr33s	1	*	You have a point
t1_duru3bv	0	*	To be fair, Bill Gates should have more of a say in policy than Homeless Joe. Bill has more at stake. He is a bigger shareholder in the country. 
t1_duqtkek	0	*	Addictive is the word Id use. I never put them on but when the significant other does, they dont get turned off until many episodes are consumed. 
t1_duvr08n	1	*	Thanks, yeah the social and political situation, particularly in the US, is full of people who don't wanna hear any facts but the ones that confirm their feelings. I'm just trying to get to the truth.
t1_durrc65	1	*	Sure. And?
t1_dus40se	0	*	No. You are the one who is confused. There is a difference between someone who generally favors a low-tax/pro business agenda and someone who denies the holocaust ever happened. 
t1_duqyqt3	0	*	Its not just Alaska though. We are talking about multiple states that do not believe NYC policies fit theirs.
t1_duriqtb	0	*	Yeah. Tiffany was his kid with a mistress while he was married to Ivana. Here's the rape stuff - http://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-rape-sexual-assault-minor-wife-business-victims-roy-moore-713531

t1_dtczy3b	0	*	this coming from an American is incredibly rich. 
t1_dte4j6k	0	*	Russia and China can both tell where missiles are going.  Plus, there would certainly be a courtesy call a few minutes before launch.  Neither is going to get into a nuclear war over North Korea.

t1_dsu5yei	0	*	Oof. That sounds hyperbolic.
t1_dstifd2	0	*	The electoral college can vote for anyone they want. The popular vote is just meant to serve as a guideline.

t1_dv39n06	1	*	Oh, I see why you people can't give up a simple gun. It's because you're worse than scum.
t1_dtkepr8	0	*	No, capitalism does not allow fascism.
t1_dsxpobs	0	*	Nice try, but swing and a miss on both points. Seriously, though, how can you be upset about possible tampering on /r/news but still support Ajit Pai? That seems legitimately cognitively dissonant...
t1_dsxyl9d	0	*	AD is AD, and sure it's russian equipment.
t1_dsz0x96	0	*	What they say, ane what practically happens, are two very sifferent things. 
t1_dsy8b82	1	*	I'd be surprised if they even had the morale to square off against Turkey.
t1_duzxrpb	1	*	Nope, mind you I'm over 40 and I think that's unfair, but it does allow me to give the young guys at work shit about how they have to be nice to me because I'm a protected class. 
t1_ds8oits	0	*	Reality likes money, too.
t1_dszs89y	0	*	[You're not faring too well here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_equivalence)
t1_dsz5m87	0	*	I mean sure, show me a Western country in which a woman will have her head cut off, be stoned to death, hung or burned alive for reporting her rape. I can show you multiple middle eastern ones
t1_dszevdi	0	*	post video proof and then i'll prove u wrong
t1_dsqp4ws	0	*	That's not a thing that happens in the first world. 
t1_dt6xv8o	0	*	They do for the majority of people.  Just because you are in the minority, that doesn't change the standard arrangement.  
t1_dt71rkx	1	*	Your people need you.
t1_dt75b5m	1	*	When I mentioned that it doesn't apply to the bottom 70%, I meant the bottom 70% of Canadians in the workforce, not full time workers specifically. I sense we have been talking past one another.
t1_dt70avw	1	*	Sort of disappointed that when I pulled it up on street view there wasn't a pile of unclaimed mail and a line of process servers out front.
t1_dt6z9sj	0	*	The A4 is a road, you silly yank.    https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A4_road_(England)

t1_dt6zb1r	1	*	Another yank.   A4 is a road!  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/A4_road_(England)
t1_dt9nm5r	0	*	Those tax rates apply to all high income earners, not just doctors. 
t1_dt77yzt	1	*	Wealth is not a zero-sum game.
t1_dt78jy5	1	*	The household mean for the United States is $60,154, while the median is $43,585.   Which one the chart was referring to, I'm not sure. But that should give a rough frame of reference, anyway. 
t1_dt6xtaj	0	*	So is it because it's politically unpopular or economically not ideal? The politically unpopular part again makes it sound like the goal is to creep it in so that people don't really notice. 
t1_dt74e17	0	*	Don't try any harder. About this point is when the word Nazi starts being thrown around. 
t1_dt7z9w1	0	*	I'm actually somewhat respected, just seems to be you delicate snowflakes that get all emotional 
t1_dt6zfwb	0	*	Than go buy its stock and get the dividend......
t1_dt76jg1	1	*	How the fuck do you accidentally get success?
t1_dt78iu3	1	*	Job growth has been happening since 2012
t1_dt71hi5	0	*	By substantially increasing the standard deduction.
t1_dt7qldq	1	*	On the backs of underpaid workers. 
t1_dt70c72	1	*	They expanded the definition of too poor for itemizing to matter. 
t1_dt77njo	1	*	Wow, didn't take long for you to go full fascist.
t1_dt7eihm	1	*	Yeah that's fair.
t1_dt7a56o	1	*	Actually, if direct bribes are legal, like in a dictatorship, rewarding voting blocks throughout the tax code is the less effective option. 
t1_dt7tlmf	1	*	So youre making it up. Im going to look for some adults now.
t1_dt75w1h	1	*	They also fancy Arial font, which is the devils work. 
t1_dt75jl7	0	*	enjoy your 28 hours a week.  but you have to maintain full time availability, so no second job for you
t1_dt71ngj	1	*	Lol. I know you are being sarcastic, but I have had to be careful with my posts in r/investing lately because that literally is what they believe.
t1_dt774wt	0	*	Oh, they're still there. They bailed out just far enough to be outside of city limits after killing all the competition because they knew that people would be forced to drive out. 
t1_dt76umy	0	*	He was pointing out that it depends on where you are in the US.    And also I guess not everywhere in the Netherlands has the same public transportation system as the big cities like Amsterdam?
t1_dt742gw	0	*	You surely did assign a lot of credit for things that happened without any legislation passing. Ill give ya that.
t1_dt74xjb	1	*	Oh I see
t1_dt6xh4s	0	*	It's both. The people of most nations are at least bilingual. We're bimetric, we can measure in either system. 
t1_dt765hu	1	*	You could make more money with a flop than a hit!
t1_dt6ymz7	1	*	I always chime in that the real minimum wage is always zero. You can enact a 100/hr minimum wage, but that just means that anyone whose labor doesn't provide equal or more value is simply not hired.
t1_dt6y9a6	0	*	 But one of those is much easier and more cost effective.  Unfortunately it doesn't hit the right bigoted undertones for votes. So we're left with Dorito in chief touting some dumbass wall. 
t1_dt6ypgt	0	*	It's over 9,000 ftfy
t1_dt73xq6	1	*	I dunno, are you a crafty accountant?
t1_dt6xe6o	0	*	Irish? 
t1_dt7fuk6	0	*	Where did you go to school if you don't mind me asking? Are you a p.eng? 66k seems very low for an engineer
t1_dt6yn49	0	*	So you believe flipping burgers should support a family?
t1_dt6xxs2	1	*	We use the A series now.  We haven't used Foolscap Folio (8xbd x 13xbd) for decades.  So our paper is full on German now, sorry...  
t1_dt7fb88	1	*	Keep filling your head with cliche hippie philosophy. 
t1_dt77tqz	0	*	If you say so. I think the shell company game in Delaware predates reddit by decades though.
t1_dt6ztsl	1	*	Nope. You also need to remember that a lot of small companies, especially online enterprises, don't even have an office. Usually just a person or couple running a business.
t1_dt7b02r	1	*	Yes but thats for the whole industry. Im talking about targeting individual companies.
t1_dt7809y	1	*	Absolutely. See the differences in tuition between Canadian students and International students for medical school. It can be up to 5 times more expensive as an International student. 
t1_dt6uqek	1	*	How many banana pages is that? 
t1_dt748y0	1	*	Haha no problem. It's definitely a quirk of the metric used
t1_dt7cgnr	0	*	No he's a fucking asshole, I hope he to god he's just some 16 year old kid talking shit and not someone who's actually working toward becoming a doctor. 
t1_dt6lvje	0	*	Except you just admitted he was responsible for the economic upturn. It just shows how bad of a leader Obama was if all Trump had to do to get the economy going is sign a piece of paper. 
t1_dt6wp09	1	*	That is federal + provincial taxes.  Everyone else is just talking about federal taxes.  In the US states tax income on top of the federal rate also.  
t1_dt74mar	0	*	And pay double to get less. Good job. 
t1_dt792u2	1	*	All I'm saying is that the idea that legalizing pot will actually have a noticeable effect on the economy is silly.
t1_dt73b8g	0	*	Well if you wanna be like that and think like that then you do you man. I can't stop ya. I'm pretty poor myself, but it's up to me to do something about it.   Take it easy.
t1_dt747au	1	*	Ironically - this is probably how tax is calculated on their earnings.   How much did you earn, Apple? Over $1,000 It says $82 Billion.  Yes that's right - Over $1,000 dollars. 
t1_dt7s9ox	0	*	Thats a lot of words with very little evidence 
t1_dt76tio	1	*	Bye
t1_dt6zek3	1	*	I really thought I was just going to make a joke. Then, not only did the joke land, it actually made sense.   I think I'm closing down my Reddit account to pull a Costanza. Leave on a high note, eh?
t1_dt77aq9	1	*	Not surprised you're too scared to answer simple questions.
t1_dt6mtrr	1	*	I'd love to read anything you provide me. I've been waiting for the duration of however long it took you to say the same bullshit in 4 threads.
t1_dt6w080	0	*	So you dont think inviting millions of muslims into Western Europe wont have an altering effect? Is that what I am to understand you are saying ? 
t1_dta0sg8	0	*	But being anti immigration *is* a Nazi stance...
t1_dt6mnic	0	*	The countries seem to be doing fine despite the presence of the spooky browns, so I don't know what you're so terrified about.
t1_dt6lkk6	0	*	What is your reason then, aside from thinking that every single brown person is part of an evil anti-west hivemind?
t1_dt6r8js	0	*	Funny how you just popped in this thread. Nobody pinged you.   
t1_dt6lwzi	1	*	Iran has said very bluntly that they want to wipe Israel off the map.  Liberals ignore this.
t1_dt6fogs	1	*	I think sometimes people forget that 2050 is only 32 years away and many of us will be quite healthy during that time and our children and grandchildren will be in their prime.
t1_dt6sbyi	0	*	Elaborate.
t1_dueeeiz	1	*	They are not to blame for the occupation. Jordan is. But they are to blame for it existing for 50 years and counting.
t1_du938qm	0	*	It's funny how there are still people who deny facts even after events such as the trials at the hague for war crimes. Some people can't face reality that they are part of the problem. 
t1_dulna70	1	*	What if you are falsely accused and then corrupt cops beat a confession out of you because you didn't pay up? 
t1_dsr617g	0	*	You are a nasty person. I give you nothing.
t1_dupzcbk	0	*	Does the federal government not have a budget?  I really don't understand what you mean when you say cut military spending in a state.  States don't have militaries.
t1_dupcfl0	0	*	You must be a cop. Poor you, someday you will realize you are on one of the lower intelligence rungs. Or maybe not. Self awareness is a characteristic of intelligence after all.
t1_du7du9l	1	*	Or thats just the colloquial term... 
t1_du4jvr5	0	*	Winner of a race is who finishes it first. And we are way ahead now. Have fun with your famine and genocide
t1_duq4r3m	0	*	What would have been the right place?
t1_duqflzh	1	*	Oh, that makes sense, never mind then.
t1_dunbzux	0	*	America can't protect their own children from mass murder...from killing each other!!! My god if that's not the clearest sign of a failed state, a corrupt culture... then what is?
t1_dtii4yd	1	*	Yeah, umm, maybe you should fact check that.  France is still overwhelmingly french-speaking white people. With a history of exploitation and colonialism. 
t1_dsmue5h	1	*	Well that's good, sorry bout the misinterpretation and now I have no qualms about agreeing with you
t1_dsxnykn	0	*	Ive never, fucking *ever* heard someone boast about the US or start a Usa! Usa! Chant while not being 100% ironic about it. Youre confirmation bias is disgusting.
t1_dsmnrmd	0	*	Hopefully one day. For now I'm simply a seasoned engineer.... Sure wish they had taught me that there is no such thing as true when I took my digital logic course...
t1_dsmu0xp	0	*	I feel like you've heard it very recently. 
t1_dsrl3dr	0	*	> You sound quite racist in this comment  you really have zero understanding of racism huh?  Only know about it from what you hear from right wing propagandists it sounds like?
t1_dubnmwf	0	*	But you called him a a western stooge.... Now they dont want a stooge but want chaos?
t1_duj38zx	0	*	Where do you live that a renewed conflict between Russia and the U.S. somehow benefits your interests? 
t1_dtr72v6	1	*	It shouldn't annoy you at all. War is hell and we're all demons. Of course everyone should be condemned in a more civilized time. That's why it's a more civilized time. 
t1_dtr6bs3	0	*	So Daniel Ellsbergs says that Starley L. Thompson has denied climate change and carcinogenic cigarettes? Link me to this interview.
t1_dtrakjb	1	*	>running a contest to gamify civilian deaths is the same as CNN running a segment and news ticker on middle east conflict   ok brainlet, whatever you say
t1_dtrsx6b	1	*	As far as i recall only the US has ever used nuclear bombs :) 
t1_dtr6qsd	0	*	So you don't think Eisenhower's a valid reference for WWII strategy? He's got more say about it than you. I directly quoted him regarding the A-bomb decision.
t1_dtr4vdu	0	*	Well duh, they wouldn't say it outright. But even their generals stated the real purpose.   So far as evidence I have Eisenhower, and you have nothing.
t1_dswdw92	0	*	And their government's are trying to hack into ours?  What your point?   And do we really want to get into China's human rights record?  Also I'm not a fan of what the CIA does.
t1_dslpv6d	1	*	> the more socialister a country is the more famine it get, the more famine it get the betterer it is  -Carl Marks c. 1932
t1_dw1dpah	0	*	> Except it isn't within their rights,  Of course it is within their rights, whether you decide to believe it or not.
t1_dw1dni7	0	*	>Fair enough, wilfully ignorant then.  Yet you post often in /r/PHP? You must be trolling me then. Well played sir.
t1_dufmax5	0	*	Oof.  >>Ignorance  >The_Donald  Nevermind!
t1_dsl6qim	1	*	Try providing some sources next time or maybe someone saying he did not say that... you know, other than the one being accused of it.  
t1_dsl7hx9	0	*	1) you have no idea how prevalent violence is in North Korea, because they are cut off from the world by a fascist regime  2) no it isnt, you just think thats relevant because of your racism
t1_dslc9s7	0	*	So then you admit that you have no such supporting sources? Thanks for admitting that!
t1_dstwb22	1	*	seeing as how the people in the article already had real degrees, we've established work ethic
t1_dstw87g	1	*	no, the president is a malignant narcissist
t1_dsrofb4	1	*	Alright. If you haven't worked since 2002, it will be hard for you to get back into the workforce.
t1_dt81a36	0	*	Well in the article it states that the money freed up from the ISS is going into more moon landings, which is what Trump wanted.
t1_dt86o0t	0	*	There is not enough commercial benefit. Without government funding the space program will die. 
t1_dt7sn9p	0	*	It's not that we can't, it's more like there is no reason to. We have enough room here on earth for the time being.
t1_dsmw7pd	1	*	Who the people?
t1_dsmh0hp	0	*	Floridas governor was also seriously on the take for Medicare fraud. He should probably be in jail tbh.
t1_dsmfqc6	0	*	This is called structuring or smurfing and can also get you in trouble.
t1_dsmhq04	1	*	The IRS rarely checks into situations where you are willingly reporting the money and paying taxes.  All they care about is that taxes are being paid at the end of the day.
t1_dsmoqmd	0	*	> Whats the connection between Clinton and Trump?  Are you kidding?  She ran against him in arguably the largest election on earth.
t1_dsme2mq	0	*	The place is a shithole, and the people who live there will tell you that, but the people are usually nice and hardworking. I have no problem with them legally coming here and working.
t1_dsmfvd5	0	*	Correct and we agree!  So I better understand why this instance is significant, who is guilty of the crime and and in which jurisdiction?
t1_dsmczqy	1	*	Nobody is arguing that conditions in some countries aren't awful. The implication that this should mean anyone coming from there should be banned and has AIDS is the idiotic part.
t1_dus78d3	1	*	why do you respect someones feelings
t1_dsnatv3	0	*	You realize 2006 was the peak of the housing bubble right?
t1_dsmjhq7	0	*	Its called precedent. It doesnt make it right but it is certainly an option for an explanation. Im not saying it was right but why should I be punished if my classmate did the same thing yesterday? 
t1_dsmc5wj	0	*	I have e feeling the cash buyer person isnt in America. Title is a huge issue. 
t1_dsmu8i4	1	*	Ah. You mean a cook house. No, Im not in the meth trade. 
t1_dsmni25	0	*	I'm hoping it's a wake up call to the DNC, personally. No doubt in my mind Bernie would've beat Trump. I think there were way more Neverhillarys than Nevertrumps. 
t1_dsmg2d9	1	*	If you're graduating soon, now's the time to start applying to Congressional offices or campaigns. Every House seat is up this year. Find a good candidate and apply.
t1_dsobv5s	1	*	No dallars, just piss here. 
t1_dsmfjtc	0	*	Ok since there's so much why haven't you linked any sources?
t1_dsme6l1	1	*	Hillary is accused of stuff but has repeatedly been cleared of wrongdoing so she's bad.   Trump has a long, documented history of being a conman *at best* and that's fine?
t1_dsmd1mw	1	*	Around $85k.
t1_dsmjkmn	0	*	Canada is pretty good. Gets cold up here though. And we have to deal with the British. 
t1_dsmlhrj	1	*	Because the people that are supposed to represent us are also doing shady business and rely on the banks to clean their hard stolen money.
t1_dsn11oj	0	*	Ok, but the country itself isn't trying to come here. So what's that got to do with immigration? If the people are fine, what's the problem? Hmmm....
t1_dsmd7nw	1	*	No you didn't.  That poster wrote complete sentences therefore not Trump.
t1_dsnzdmi	0	*	You have an odd definition of tangible proof
t1_dsmesfk	0	*	Exactly, when can 30% of the population vote to get someone in office.   Your clueless, when your sample size is 75% demoncrat of course you get an approval rating like 30%
t1_dsmil23	0	*	Nope they're apparently only required to tell you want to hear with no proof.
t1_dts7onc	0	*	Those conditions cost money to treat. And they result in complications that make other conditions more expensive to treat.
t1_dsobfq6	0	*	What did Russia do 70 years ago?  Moving the goalposts.
t1_dsp9efx	1	*	Idk how polonium210 ended up in his blood, couldve happened to anyone anytime.
t1_dsp64ri	1	*	Shut up, Vlad
t1_dsp7ivf	0	*	The goal post was annexation of other nations, not killing people. You have attempted to move the goal posts. Therefore, you lose. Good day.
t1_dsqyjk4	1	*	Yeah, because what I said hasnt happened.
t1_dsol1ou	0	*	Do you know anything about the Crimean situation in the last 3 years? 
t1_dspkj4f	0	*	Wow shocking that he may have been referring to the country he governs and didn't address the ones he doesn't. Shook. 
t1_dspdd89	0	*	So disregarding ones which abstained (because we don't know which side they would be on), we have 33% of worlds population vs 4% of worlds population. Sounds like a majority.
t1_dv29ao2	0	*	A lot of which are sitting at a sea level. Yea there are issues. However it is unlikely a new plant is going to be compeative on completion with the plumiting cost of storage and renewables atm

t1_duf5shv	0	*	holy moving goalposts batman!  Cant even name one, not a single resource to backup your claim.
t1_dueymxv	0	*	No. Competent authoritarians dont want to use brute force to implement what they want. It's a last resort.
t1_duesshl	1	*	Thanks! :)

t1_dtoge08	1	*	The only illnesses that horses get are heart attacks. 
t1_dtkodvt	0	*	Yep, usually the top comment is about how the journalists totally exaggerated what actually happened. Was surprised to see that it is different here.
t1_dtkfvkv	1	*	Dont think you'll thank me after you read some of the threads there :> honestly in most cases its just thinly veiled rape fanfic
t1_dtlhfh8	1	*	Haha perfect reply. Also thanks for the cancer 
t1_dtkpuuz	1	*	Good to hear, hopefully some change is forecasted.

t1_dt5cpqg	0	*	Hey, at least you're self aware enough to realize you're not worth a second of serious consideration. That's a start.
t1_dt5j5au	0	*	Is is the verb. Number is the subject.  there is a number is the sentence.  I agree that its the least important part of the sentence for meaning, but its the functional part for grammar.
t1_dt5g9t1	1	*	I had a dieselgate Jetta, best car I've ever owned. After putting nearly 200,000 miles on it and still having $16k to pay, I sold it back. 45 mpg always, top speed I hit was 122 mph. 
t1_dt5jir2	0	*	You seem really dense. How many different ways do people have to explain to you that decades-old Disney IP should become public domain, just like the stuff they took inspiration from?

t1_dt5l8z7	1	*	Life is unfair
t1_dt1qjrf	0	*	Exactly. So your example is not equivalent. Usa claiming territory in the yellow sea would be ridiculous.   Now you can see why China's claims in the scs are ridiculous as well and not recognized
t1_dt28g14	1	*	Guilty. 
t1_dt1zz91	0	*	You chose it as arbitrator. If it had given a verdict favourable to China you d be all over it. You are invading that part of the sea, quite simply, no matter all the fabricated answers you have.

t1_du6yq81	1	*	Exactly.
t1_du78shh	1	*	Of course you can. I just did. If you take logical not emotional view, it makes sense

t1_dv1b8jz	1	*	But not on network - which you can in France.
t1_dv1068x	0	*	It's an order of magnitude thing.  For instance, Fox News is no longer broadcast in the UK at all since they kept accumulating fines for broadcasting laughable falsehoods.
t1_dv13fwu	1	*	Thats funny. :) 
t1_dv1mpk1	0	*	That's ridiculous. Your whole premise is ridiculous.

t1_dv39h02	1	*	> Typical American with no clue of Europe  Oh the fucking irony. You're a walking stereotype.
t1_dv1d52g	1	*	Right? Almost like his DNA evolved on another planet... Making it immune to local infections.  Oh, I see now you meant prosecutorial immunity...
t1_dv1phki	1	*	AFAIK no-one has ever been charged in a US court with a crime for posting obscene content on twitter
t1_dv0z582	1	*	Why do you think that guys comment holds any weight at all?
t1_dv1mg0c	1	*	Thank you. Your support and skull sizes have been documented.

t1_dv10axj	0	*	What higher courts?
t1_dv1ulq0	1	*	But why is that illegal
t1_dv17nh9	1	*	Happy fascism is still fascism. And I don't need to live in a police state. That's the point.
t1_dv2v16o	1	*	I don't think anybody is arguing that its a cool thing to post on twitter, just that there shouldn't be laws against it.  If twitter took the posts down I wouldnt care.
t1_dv1x3oy	1	*	Playing the sovereign alien citizen card I see

t1_dv0s6t6	0	*	Then fuck every justice system in the world.
t1_dv1a5qp	0	*	No one is claiming that what she did was good or Christian or whatever. This is a total red herring. The claim is that it shouldnt be illegal.

t1_dv0ozbk	1	*	she's not free to say and post that obviously
t1_dv0xkwj	0	*	Or I'm just not a delicate flower who turns the other way in the face of reality.   
t1_dv0qkz4	0	*	Oh yeah, when thinking about censorship I forgot about the think of the children argument. Alright yeah lets pretend ISIS isnt doing anything. Anything otherwise would scare kids and thats not good.
t1_dv0p71a	1	*	I'm not sure you understand what it means to be free to say and post whatever she likes. If there are legal consequences to saying something, you aren't free to say it.
t1_dv0qs17	1	*	Personally, I thought the Bill of Rights was quite a bit before the French Decalaration, but it looks like I was wrong.
t1_dv179bq	0	*	This wasnt his question. He was asking if the law can be absurd.

t1_dv159h4	1	*	No, Im on the right one. 
t1_dv0xjbt	0	*	I don't have to rationalize shit to you. I'm telling you my reasons for watching those videos. What you think about that is irrelevant.   I'll watch whatever the fuck i want, no victim no crime.

t1_dv0pjmp	1	*	According to what, though? U.S. law? It makes sense in France, where she's being investigated, and where she must follow the rule of law. 
t1_dv1j561	0	*	Or indirectly in the case of blackmail, or not at all in the case of things like conspiracy, harassment and distribution of disturbing images and child porn...
t1_dv1769a	1	*	Why would that be a fair comparison? She posted these on twitter.   And if you post banned content on Facebook, you dont get charged with an offense by the government. 
t1_dv1x7xq	1	*	What? Please explain how the comparison isn't fair.
t1_dv1f8tq	1	*	The truth shall make you free, unless showing the truth is against the law.
t1_dv1mftw	0	*	My in-laws Christian Church does too. They celebrate that thier God is powerful and violent. (Thier words) As long as they don't advocate specific action, it's protected stupidity.
t1_dv1dh04	1	*	Debate is always going on.
t1_dv0s8qc	0	*	In the US you're by law not allowed to publicly say that you you want to kill the president. Complete, 100% freedom of speech doesn't exist.

t1_dtuwq9i	1	*	I hate to be that guy, but you have that literally backwards. SpaceX is corporate and NASA is a public agency...

t1_dtuwr46	1	*	If you're using we to refer to humanity, then your sentence as written says that 2/3 rocket boosters were recovered on the first ever launch of a rocket by humans
t1_dtup0cm	0	*	Problem is a few hundred feet is probably not enough. You have to remember that the booster is stopping a few ton object from a speed greater than terminal velocity.
t1_dtvcj8d	0	*	Why ? with the Internet and immersive VR, etc. pretty certain you could have enough entertainment.
t1_dschu9h	0	*	No one needs to hack your email to cause sensitive email to your account. And clearly hacking one account would cause all other passwords to be worthless based on your comment.
t1_dslhnlh	1	*	True

t1_dsxkl5x	0	*	I mean, you just apologized for making a stereotype and then went and did it again in the same sentence. Probably why you were down voted in the first place. 
t1_dsxyjns	1	*	Then again I really suggest you read The Wealth of Nations because John Smith felt very similar as you do. He didn't advocate for an unregulated free market.

t1_dttzzky	0	*	But you said:  > not once had killed or displaced Palestinians without cause.   So what was the cause for killing that boy? Ill wait... 
t1_dtt2xwc	0	*	pistachio
t1_dtsp2z0	0	*	Begone, Troll. Declaring independence after winning a defensive war is perfectly legitimate.
t1_dtsm3ff	0	*	I think it would be better for Israel to just annex the area and expel its current inhabitants.  But they've decided to be nicer than they could be, and they're paying for it.
t1_dtcbk8k	0	*	people that shouldn't have had to die, most countries didn't have civil wars over slavery, and also it took less than 20 years for reconstruction to be destroyed and Jim Crow laws to move back in.
t1_dtbkp6s	1	*	I don't even know what you're arguing.
t1_dta5059	1	*	Did you not take that bit in middle school about differentiating facts from opinions? Or are you still in middle school?
t1_ds3tzxj	0	*	Try harder haha
t1_du442cj	0	*	Trump will be president until 2024 max.  I think you're over indexing on one president.
t1_duwnyz3	1	*	They are only dogmatic. Reality is a big frackin grey zone. 
t1_duwo9lz	0	*	But if it's only suspected then it's not proved. How can you give punishment on accusation alone?
t1_dux4d2r	0	*	BTW what about all the jeez you jerked off? If you cummed into a woman there would a human been born. You are stripping him of existence. 
t1_duwh1qi	0	*	Are you really so thick to miss the fact that making any retractions at all means they are far more concerned with the truth than whatever right wing shit rag you subscribe to?
t1_duyeu4z	0	*	If you don't even want to understand the philosophy of antinatalism then don't try to debate it.  Understanding is not the same as agreeing. 
t1_du1ysnd	1	*	Interesting.. I'll admit I don't have a detailed knowledge of the Tsarist period. I'll have to read up and check that..
t1_du4gfjt	0	*	Yeah exactly a modern ruling due to now knowledge of how the world works.
t1_du26fy9	1	*	Lmao all good

t1_du2guf1	1	*	Ex-Muslim here. Fasting never interfered with my school performance nor my sister's, who happens to wear the hijab regularly. In fact, she's in the top 15% of her university.

t1_dtqaxy6	0	*	oh, were catching signals of you being 15 all right 
t1_dtp490y	0	*	Oh. Our boys in blue... the same that tried to blackmail Martin Luther King Jr. and told him he should commit suicide.    Our boys. Right. They are surely above reproach. 
t1_dumx95r	1	*	That's also not the same thing. If you don't agree, why don't you address the actual thing instead of using weird analogies?
t1_dunxbcp	1	*	Noice!

t1_dsb8357	0	*	So you are making shit up    Got it.   You are better than this 
t1_dsb5i8m	1	*	Yeah Biden would've definitely had much less controversy surrounding him. Seems more charismatic too 
t1_dsbazgl	0	*	Deficit (or surplus) is the state of the federal budget when costs (government spending) is deducted from revenues (taxes +etc.). It is not a rate. 
t1_dsbjnls	1	*	Yep just like most republican voters are metaphorically millionaires. No actual millions of dollars just metaphorically.
t1_dsb3lx2	0	*	don't worry about it.  if you're being honest and not just trying to stick it to trump then i'll take your word for it and look into it.
t1_dsb03ni	0	*	Agreed, but obviously we should have some control over who comes in and who doesnt, right? 
t1_dsbbe7z	0	*	Good...Strike them down with all your hatred, and your journey towards the dark side will be complete.
t1_dsbf8rl	0	*	Thats a terrible point. There are plenty of nice areas in Mexico and plenty of reasons for anyone to go there. Just as there are both wonderful and shitty places in the US.
t1_dsbszcx	0	*	You are using political language to revise history and dehumanize people. Did your public education have 1984 in its curriculum? 
t1_dsenxmz	1	*	Ok, so we build a wall, now what about the vast majority of illegal immigrants who come here legally yet over stay their allowed time?
t1_dsb8ok0	1	*	I mean he won't shut the fuck up about doom and gloom despite it being in fields he's not researched in. 
t1_dsbw2so	1	*	He is a stable genius, obviously.
t1_dsbzd85	0	*	So why would a wall fail? 
t1_dsbd8r2	1	*	Is there something you would like to say here? Regarding fake news? The world is waiting.
t1_dsbbpzc	1	*	Totes bro. 
t1_dsb63ds	1	*	Appreciated. I'll peruse it later :)
t1_dsay1kd	1	*	It wasn't a problem, but:  1. Obama...  2. The Mexicans 3. The blacks  4. The establishment  
t1_dsbjj0t	1	*	Yes they are Daddy Trump said so!
t1_dsb4feq	1	*	And that's only because of the highly blue cities in it.
t1_dsbu6tf	1	*	Exactly. You and I are paying for it. Mexico will just have less cash flow. 
t1_dsbf8aw	0	*	Yes, that's the idea, I would imagine.
t1_dsb6jo8	0	*	It is another topic but thats the rationale is the same.  Why do we need a wall?  Because illegals immigrants aka Criminals are entering our country.  Hey illegals why dont you respect our laws? 
t1_dsb04i0	0	*	Or Mexican producers reduce their margins to offset price increases from tariffs. 
t1_dsb8bam	0	*	You said neither choice was good. I am saying that we should choose presidents based on their ability to lead the country, not on their ability to charm voters with lies.
t1_dsbc1ke	0	*	Do you believe that Trump won the popular vote? That Obama was born in Kenya? 
t1_dsb1eol	0	*	His businesses went bankrupt but he kept making money. Thats called being a good business man.  Obligatory: I dont care for Trump but this is a stupid argument 
t1_dsb4eud	1	*	That is what I thought the plan was based on his original position page in august 2015.   https://web.archive.org/web/20150816183115/https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions/immigration-reform

t1_dsg6amd	0	*	Its his actual plan. 
t1_dsg6bw4	0	*	You want to know what his plan is. I gave a link to it. If you dont want to read it then thats in you. Stay ignorant.

t1_dtz7t74	1	*	i assume that's illegal, so the fact that they're willing to let themselves be exploited is secondary to companies breaking the law and paying them less than minimum wage and not being punished for it

t1_dtxf4gl	0	*	Did they get the drop on you?

t1_dswind8	1	*	They weren't advocating for abortion to be banned, they were advocating for individuals to choose to not have abortions. Are you being deliberately obtuse? The difference is not that subtle. 
t1_dswjgzc	1	*	That remains to be seen.

t1_dswrg5z	0	*	But its not murder. The USA legal system didnt view it as murder pre Roe v Wade either.  Youll have to try a little harder than shock value if you want to make a compelling case.

t1_dsxn20n	1	*	And we're back to pregnancy is a punishment for having sex. 
t1_dswm0jo	0	*	From a legal standard, which is what we are discussing, it matters. In fact, that's all that matters. 
t1_dswo6v5	1	*	And thats what I appreciates about you!
t1_dswn864	0	*	Yes. Too little too late.
t1_dswqfid	0	*	So a person in a coma has no right to live, even if the doctors say that the person will certainly break out of the coma in some time?
t1_dsxbyi7	0	*	If the majority of Canadians decided capital punishment was the way to go, then yes murder would be okay and those opposed to it would just have to accept that. How's this different?
t1_dswt7me	0	*	We're talking about a particular organization, and they simply don't. I'm not missing your point, I'm disputing it because it's demonstrably wrong.
t1_dswus09	0	*	Like eating animals  ?
t1_dszvu73	0	*	And I just explained that the issue was settled. Democratically. 
t1_dswpzak	0	*	You responded to me but quoted somebody else. Wut
t1_dswpswf	0	*	I'm quite sure the law doesn't use that terminology
t1_dswm0vf	0	*	Then you hate seeing the government infringe upon your right the believe whatever you want...U0001f914
t1_dswptqm	0	*	Kinda like how a guy has zero say in getting a abortion right?
t1_dsx79jw	1	*	It's cool, it actually proves your point really. There are many languages with bizarre and strange rules that first time learners have to wrap their heads around. English is no exception.
t1_dsxbjre	1	*	Thank-you. I appreciate your comment 
t1_dsxej79	1	*	Personally, I wouldn't want to live a life of suffering. I'd rather never be born. 
t1_dsws0xo	0	*	Becaus the point of the primary is to vet candidates and nobody had asked.  Its both
t1_dsx1g0j	1	*	Pretty sure there's no such country as 'America'...
t1_dt12t70	0	*	The door which is not opened for a beggar will open for a doctor.
t1_dswod37	0	*	Well duh, but we're talking about aborting a fetus, not killing a baby. You can't kill something that's not alive.
t1_dsxe8q6	0	*	Well, we just disagree. I don't count a non sentient, non breathing lump of cells as a person, you do.
t1_dswr3zx	1	*	I said nothing about hair. 
t1_dswn23c	1	*	Is this a real question? Adoption can cost $40,000 immediately. Theres no payment plan. A child you raise doesnt cost $40,000 in one quick go. 
t1_dswrlr0	0	*	Nah even performance enhancing drug can compete with it. hahaha i find that funny. dont apologize for a joke dude ! 
t1_dsyn6w6	1	*	> I can kinda understand where you're coming from now  Good, I'm glad you got there.
t1_dswq87w	0	*	Ultimately I don't think they should be funding either stance. But as stated earlier, my point was you are aborting more then just cells which I noticed you haven't disputed.
t1_dswn1hw	0	*	So there shouldn't be abortions after 5 months? 
t1_dsx08am	1	*	What specifically about death takes away their personhood? I would bet that your dividing line is brain function, since that is what death really boils down to.
t1_dswwk05	1	*	Apparently not, you're still not showing how walking around a city for a while is any sort of learning experience/benefit to the community. It is a difference not only in scale but also type.
t1_dswqk2z	0	*	Actually I've received this argument before, and the asnwer would be no because they, as they stand alone, do not possess the genetic material necessary to form a life.
t1_dsx5wdx	0	*	Yes. If your appendix is rupturing and about to kill you then it's ok to have it removed.
t1_dswybd7	1	*	What if they did not choose to have sex?  Or if they chose to have sex but did not choose to get pregnant?
t1_dswqlyl	1	*	You support abortion all the way to birth? Wow
t1_dswu4mq	1	*	It doesnt have a beating heart until about 6 weeks. 
t1_dswpigy	0	*	Perhaps I didn't read the article closely enough. Could you explain what you mean.
t1_dswnz8a	0	*	? What ad hominem did I use other than saying you're extremely naive if you think (which is not an ad hominem) 
t1_dswuuht	1	*	To make it simple: If you are a human living inside another human you have no rights. Does not need to be more difficult than that.
t1_dswqg6y	1	*	But if the pregnancy is unwanted, the woman will suffer emotionally, physically, and financially.  So you think there has to be a certain level of suffering before abortion is acceptable?
t1_dswni6f	1	*	Correct. They're are tons of completely legal antiabortion billboards, bus stop benches, etc in southern Alberta. 
t1_dsz3ni0	0	*	No, it's how he used his position as PM to stiffle debates and undercut if not outright silence experts and other parties which might contradict his party's opinions.
t1_dswp5p9	1	*	Yes. I realize that. I'm not going to change my views on right to choose however I will read further into what our laws actually say. 
t1_dswtenb	0	*	You are so dense.  The government won't give you money to advocate against peoples rights.
t1_dswqldw	0	*	Right, and to act like that somehow means the debate is over is ridiculous
t1_dswmzs1	0	*	If someone isn't ready to have a child and wants to get an abortion badly enough, they're going to find a way to have an abortion, no matter what. How would you stop them short of using force?
t1_dsx130e	0	*	You've just had one Alberta PM for almost ten years, don't get greedy now
t1_dsx1vxb	1	*	No it happens. Theyre just sneakier.   http://www.theguardian.pe.ca/news/local/advocacy-group-suing-pei-government-over-lack-of-abortion-access-100800/
t1_dswum2d	0	*	Yeah, I don't believe that. I think what's actually central to most pro-lifers is convincing us to conform to their religious views.
t1_dswretu	1	*	That sounds like a great environment for a kid, with a mother who resents it
t1_dswzgp2	0	*	Irrelevant goalpost that is unrelated to my original point. 
t1_dswn4zk	1	*	> which I dont even think even extremists like _______would be willing to do.  I've said that so many times this last year though :(  
t1_dswpl0a	0	*	Because theres never ever been a law that was fundamentally immoral...
t1_dsz2lh7	0	*	That's ok, I know it must suck having no life because you spend too much time playing video games. Not my problem though. :)
t1_dsx58jc	0	*	Thank you. I now think he is somewhere in between the two.
t1_dsx7p1r	1	*	Okay chief. 
t1_dswr5uh	1	*	Sorry :(
t1_dswq1c2	0	*	Lmao, you're making a pedantic troll argument to support stripping people of human rights and regressing the state of society in the name of a wealthy elite that despises you.
t1_dswrfw1	0	*	>women have rights, including the right to bodily autonomy  Not when their choice involves taking another life
t1_dsxvaw6	1	*	Pregnancy is not necessarily a choice. Contraceptives fail sometimes.
t1_dsx43ye	1	*	That doesnt need to really define how someone like harper shaped his thinking. He clearly saw economic potential in the west and how oil could be used as an engine nationally, for better or worse.
t1_dswxr5n	1	*	How is your *anecdote* about adoption relevant to the *generalized claims* you made about anti-abortion people being hypocritical?  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anecdotal_evidence
t1_dsxrd53	1	*	When the mom decides to keep it Edit: or get it fertilized with the intent to keep it.
t1_dswlz0a	0	*	nope.  Not according to our laws. 
t1_dszygbm	0	*	You've got nothing to discuss anyway.  You're neither Canadian, nor a woman with a uterus, and no stake at all in this discussion.  You just came here to troll.  Peace.
t1_dswrby9	0	*	Viable with or without medical assistance?
t1_dswv1st	1	*	A dog is more of a person than a fetus, I'd kill a fetus but not my dog, because my dog is cool. A fetus can't run around and shit, it's like barely alive
t1_dsxdq90	0	*	And this is the moment I no longer have anything to say to you. Thank you for proving my point.
t1_dswn359	1	*	I'd rather see no kids in the foster care program and more in loving homes with parents who want them and who are ready for the responsibility. 
t1_dswmy0s	0	*	It's not a problem, I'm a law abiding citizen. I also respect fundamental rights and freedoms.   
t1_dswro3j	0	*	Exactly thank you !!! I dont get people hops over the border to come to America because theyre already Americans amiright ???? /s 
t1_dswpgdj	0	*	I think we can all agree we as a society should reduce abortions.  (Making it illegal of course wouldn't actually reduce them, either)
t1_dswi2cq	0	*	Slavery=/=gay marriage       Your argument is a complete contradiction.
t1_dtd9uy9	0	*	No, I do not recall the DNC making any statemet accusing either the 2000 or 2016 elections of illegitimacy. Please, link me to these statements, if they do exist.
t1_dtcqj4g	0	*	  Since you persist in lying about my words into the ignore file you go. 
t1_ds3f0tl	0	*	I do have an opinion of my own. My opinion is that speech should be free, and that 'hate speech' is a bullshit term made by cowards who want to censor me.
t1_ds16fxo	0	*	> If you act like a nazi ironically you're still a nazi dude.   Lol.   > Take your political ideology elsewhere.   No.  
t1_ds273v9	1	*	Keep lying to yourself!
t1_ds3bh59	0	*	those are just weasel words for denying free speech.
t1_ds1dj6t	1	*	I must have missed the fact that you're obviously not interested in having a civil discussion on the matter. Therefore, disregard my previous comment and go about your way.
t1_ds15c13	0	*	No, the left are the ones ending debates, especially on college campuses. Whining gets you no where. Happy New Year & please grow up! 
t1_ds1b6rd	1	*	But he linked an article quoting an anonymous tweet that said so!
t1_ds1crz2	0	*	Are you just gonna ignore literally all the other points and just say oh we started it but realised it was a really bad idea once the Germans actually did it
t1_ds12a47	1	*	Facebook  (for example) is not US-based in Europe. It's an Irish company. 
t1_ds7etdg	0	*	Which would be a monumentally stupid amendment
t1_ds6ixll	0	*	Sure, why not? The alternative of making an absolute and final decision over something that will affect countless future generations is kind of terrifying.
t1_duythpl	0	*	Neither of these things contradicts my statements before. The only incorrect thing I have said so far was about the Three Kingdoms timeline.
t1_dus8wx4	0	*	Ummm, yeah? What does NaZi stand for again? 
t1_durtq5k	0	*	> by the hellspawn Khmer Rouge  Guess which Western country helped to keep them in power....
t1_dtpp0vy	0	*	The bigger larger banks we're given liquidity in order to continue to exist. And btw, they repaid all bailout money ***plus*** interest.
t1_duuc22w	0	*	Why does EnVyUs suck now? I just looked up the rankings. They were like top 3 the last that I remember, and now they are #22.
t1_duuxclr	1	*	Gotta spend money to make money
t1_duy3moa	0	*	Not too bright? I think you should work on your reading comprehension. I never said it was pretending to be balanced. I said td is abnormal. Jesus you Trumpeteers are stupid.
t1_duufd60	1	*	Yes, that game.
t1_duuf5ca	1	*	Self-contained SCUBA apparatus. 
t1_duuf8vz	1	*	IT Technologies.
t1_duuh6xy	1	*	Balls
t1_duue1tz	1	*	MLS soccer
t1_ds8mezz	1	*	Nuuuu! I've been thwarted! 
t1_ds8bhte	0	*	Okay. And like someone else said in this thread, will child labor in China, Indonesia etc disappear? Because some rich people will get more oil money?
t1_ds9c7wr	1	*	I learned not to let the perfect be the enemy of the good.
t1_dt9ulei	1	*	Except in the 29 states, plus DC, where that is explicitly outlawed.
t1_dt9msff	1	*	I would guess that it would invite political which hunts from the other side (GOP) in order to maintain equity. Similar to Trump's rhetoric about crooked Hillary  
t1_dt9cf04	0	*	You can't confirm third hand sourced reports....  Why do you think I give hannity any credibility whatsoever...?  Has it struck you that news outlets all use the same sources...?   *shocked face*
t1_dt9dtsc	0	*	lmao bro youre an out-of-touch idiot. 
t1_dt9m6p2	0	*	Again, my comment was in reply to the 8 years statement.  How is anything you said relevant to my comment?
t1_dt9on9p	0	*	Nah, hes evil.
t1_dt9js5r	0	*	Sorry [this link](http://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng?i=001-57974)  should work.  Court held that protection of journalist source is important to protect role of press as public watchdog
t1_dt9s53k	1	*	I'm also not the person this guy thought he was talking to...
t1_dt9qwmp	0	*	As I understand it. The EC is supposed to make sure dumbfucks like Trump dont make it into office. 
t1_dtaa1h3	0	*	> fake Hawaiian attack alerts  Are you actually suggesting that the false alert didn't happen? That all the non-Breitbart media in the world just fabricated it?
t1_dt9p1fc	0	*	Everyone has an agenda. 
t1_dt9rwjm	0	*	oh is that what i said? just because i think something is utterly stupid doesn't mean i don't understand it. 
t1_dt9gzp9	0	*	His base also grows our food. 
t1_dt99zf3	1	*	Yeah, I was being generous.
t1_dt9ep2u	0	*	> You are given an option to terminate the pregnancy  There is no such thing as terminating a pregnancy.  And my answer remains the same: killing innocent children is wrong. 
t1_dt9gfl3	0	*	What do you believe caused this shift?
t1_dteilxk	0	*	Lol. When you have to play stupid and pretend you no longer speak English to try to argue an angle, why are you even arguing it?
t1_dt9r36b	0	*	Fuck your propaganda. Americans see through it. 
t1_dta37mz	1	*	I'm not sure what you are referring to.  Are you saying the team investigating the trump/russia collusion isn't biased? 
t1_dt9zyw9	0	*	Dude, NOBODY is accusing Trump of legally reducing his taxes. Nobody says that is wrong.  You are fighting strawmen because you can't fight the facts.  And now please, tell me how facts are fake news.
t1_dt95b7o	1	*	Bro this person is SO far gone. Do not waste anymore time. Based on their frequency of commenting, this seems to be their job.
t1_dta12us	1	*	She's officially said that she isn't running (for now at least).
t1_dtaelqb	1	*	Or they just focused on one area of America, I could not find any information about it, that is why I felt the sample size was to small, to much America to understand it in 2200 people.
t1_dt9sa2o	1	*	Nah im good. Dont want to get infected with the crazies 
t1_dtboexq	1	*	Yea, we all know the US will move in with France someday. 
t1_dtb2lka	1	*	Yeah, but it's only within 2% like that because of first past the post. 
t1_dt9berx	0	*	Lol you don't verify sources who heard something second hand..... How dense are you.   Yes you heard it from the other guy right? Okay good
t1_dtasumo	0	*	What a bunch of bullshit. So a society like Britain and one like the US have VASTLY different societal norms?   Try again.

t1_dt9na56	1	*	Corruption in the DNC is a Republican myth sold to the naive. 
t1_dt9trke	0	*	Unfortunately a lot of liberal voters think that about every midterm election, which is why they never show up to vote and keep getting crushed.
t1_dt9ofuw	1	*	He requires a whole new category: chaotic stupid
t1_dtbts07	0	*	Regulated capitalism is pretty amazing. You wouldnt have half the shit you have without it.
t1_dt9g6ux	1	*	Let's make this simple.  You argue that there are people in his employ actively working against him.  Yes or no.   You argue he has proof of this.  Yes or no. 
t1_dt9ewou	1	*	I mean, that's a very valid point. The answer is that I don't know. For me, George Carlin is the only person that's ever really come close to a real answer. People, generally, are stupid.

t1_dt9f2se	0	*	Ah OK so it's not a valid cup then, I forgot that little by-law that prevents a team from benefitting on luck.
t1_dt9qvv2	1	*	Thats why 2020 is important. Census and district lines are redrawn every 10 years by the states.  The GOP won big in 2010 in state elections so they were able to gerrymandering things to all hell.
t1_dt9mv72	1	*	Wouldn't a crime need to be committed first?  Oh, wait, under an authoritarian government they secretly convict the person first, then they find a crime to charge them with for the public to see. 
t1_dt9i7t2	1	*	Trey gowdy is a corrupt idiot, though.  Nothing came of his years long Benghazi quest.  He has no credibility.

t1_dt9p979	1	*	Convictions for what, exactly? What actions, specifically, do you think were criminal?
t1_dt9pss3	1	*	Just like how Mueller's investigation will come up empty any time now?
t1_dt9vhhe	1	*	And both committed High Crimes and Misdemenors worthy of impeachment and removal from office.  Democrats did not remove Clinton.  Therefore you can say 'both sides are bad', yes.
t1_dt9ifhj	1	*	I did, he called it a conspiracy theory and then tried to act superior and Enlightened. I've learned better than to try to deal with people who act holier-than-thou.

t1_dta6tjo	1	*	And yet, planet-wide catastrophe has never happened in human history, and never will. Forgive me if I see any change of planet-wide catastrophe, other than zero, as a bullshit metric.

t1_dtpvsyz	0	*	This is my favorite thread on Reddit in a long time. Time to crack another cold one.
t1_dtexeev	1	*	They are using the justification it is self-defense. While it may be wrong in international law, it's not enough to say 100% of these were unwarranted without knowing the facts.

t1_dtd43it	1	*	having your skinned burnt off isn't death tho!
t1_dtg6cp2	1	*	Yup, has very little in common with the movie though. It's really good and the ending is one of my favorites. Also it's a novella so it's really accessible.
t1_dtd0x9x	1	*	Are you saying they weren't? As I said before, I wasn't sure. Are you?
t1_dtdtgwa	0	*	Stealing info is not on the same level as assassinations, not by a long shot. 
t1_dtd0l9o	1	*	No that wouldnt matter at all. What he did was still illegal just because what the government was doing was also illegal does not change what he did.
t1_dtdjsc8	0	*	You must feel so smart for tossing in insults like that. Very clever.
t1_dtdafom	1	*	The point is the claim that someone died is probably not true. Why are you having trouble getting that?
t1_dtdy1i5	0	*	That might have had to do with the terrorist attacks coming out of it. You think Israel would just do that after trying to give Gaza freedom? Do your research.

t1_duna260	0	*	Are you honestly comparing *the Third Reich to Hezbollah?.* OK. If you want to look that silly you can.
t1_dukanyv	0	*	Your's made literally no sense...it was an analogy made by a brainwashed person that completely lacks logic.
t1_dujk2vp	1	*	Dude all our ancestors come from everywhere... get off your high horse. If you're Israeli I recommend you reading one of your country mens books, Sapiens by Yuval Harari 
t1_dv55ym4	0	*	Basketball team in high school?
t1_dudlh7m	1	*	Well shit, guess I'll move to Norway and feel good about myself. How do we do this in the uk/us??? 
t1_dv0dd21	0	*	No. It doesn't. But you sound like someone with zero understanding of German politics and an ideological need for this claim to be true.
t1_dsp0f1y	0	*	Good bye, I hope you'll open up your eyes one day and realize the truth.  Or you will be in for one _Hell_ of a surprise. Pun intended.
t1_dspct30	0	*	Why doesn't God just NOT give the lady cancer or prevent her from drowning in the first place? Just because you can't explain/ understand something dosent  make it a miracle.
t1_dstaj6k	1	*	  Why don't you explain how I'm wrong instead of whining?    How many SJWs are anti feminist and anti Muslim? 
t1_dsppjrb	0	*	Dude you might want to actually look up how the Bible was written, because you clearly have no idea what you're talking about. It's amazing how your Watchtower brainwashes all of you guys
t1_dspkxv2	0	*	Anything that is unfalsifiable is worth diddly shit and in pretty much every scenario I can think of, simply untrue.
t1_dsqie5y	0	*	Well yeah, The Office did a whole episode about it.
t1_dsspwnu	0	*	Yeah, that is about as vague and abstract as one could get.
t1_dss07y6	1	*	Again, on both sides equally so you can take it out of the equation.
t1_dthkj55	0	*	I believe it happened because it did happen, the head of the NSA testified to that fact under oath.  https://www.snopes.com/2017/05/10/french-election-russian-hack/
t1_dsj18hh	1	*	That would have still killed a bunch of people.  Although getting other people to commit violence for you is pretty much the mark of a pacifist.
t1_dsj2057	1	*	I have had Canada post deliver my Medical Cannabis to someone 4 blocks away that had the same street number and different postal code.....was not happy.
t1_dslz8dm	0	*	I can see youre condemning both sides. I asked at what point *I* made some statement that *you* interpreted as justifying these murders. You have yet to answer either of my questions. 
t1_dsit41m	0	*	No, it's because it's immature and let's news orgs jack each other off without doing anything substantial or actually noteworthy.
t1_dskk2w1	1	*	Well, clearly not Obama. What you're saying is that he had no conviction, which is probably why other world leaders didn't respect him. They just saw a weak person.
t1_dsj5yif	1	*	I voted in the American presidential election ;)
t1_dsjefjn	0	*	Thanks, that's all I needed
t1_dsivjxs	0	*	>keep beating the indians would ya,  at the end of the day thats all that matters  As is tradition
t1_dsitumx	0	*	Yes, and how it was then corrected: http://www.irishnews.com/picturesarchive/irishnews/irishnews/2015/08/20/205603452-ae2418c1-8f5b-446f-af10-e78b3fc370d9.jpg 
t1_dsj5a1z	1	*	I don't think you are reading their posts, bub.
t1_dsj8ovw	1	*	You can make any excuse you want. The fact is that if he really didn't believe he deserved it, he wouldn't have accepted it.
t1_dsivatu	0	*	So it's a 2 party or throw away your vote system.
t1_du4nzog	0	*	Sounds like a Nazi rant to me. 
t1_du4ifv2	1	*	lmao
t1_du52n9q	1	*	Ah, okay. I meant, it's unclear what's the percentage of the Muslims vs. Christian right-wingers in the violent crimes.
t1_du5889t	1	*	Fair enough
t1_dudqrxy	0	*	That's Facebook and Twitter deleting posts, not the German state. That's not a free speech issue, it's private companies doing something.  And how is mass raping ok? 
t1_du6vspm	0	*	http://www.pewglobal.org/2013/06/04/the-global-divide-on-homosexuality/
t1_du4s9vx	0	*	Seems like a lot of words all for the purpose of saying  I'm a Nazi apologist shitstain.
t1_du58dwe	0	*	If I point at a white guy and say, he's an asshole. Then he said, that's racist. Would he be validated to say that? That regardless of his race, that particular white guy is an asshole.
t1_dtvot46	0	*	No no you filthy american dont you know you speak american which is totally not english
t1_dtpwsay	0	*	It's more like the Russian trolls, and alt-right are ferociously defending the motherland like rabid animals.  Russia is bad, and you people are idiots.
t1_du1z9fc	0	*	Who do you think controls the US Government, and hence the military?
t1_du0lqk3	0	*	The tax bill modifies state tax rules because they're allowed to do that. Thanks for reading or understanding the supremacy clause 
t1_dug779q	0	*	> You know who wouldn't gain shit from peace? South korea.  Sorry to butt into your argument, but this has me baffled.  Why doesn't SK gain from peace?
t1_dueiwri	1	*	Sighhh so this is just all pie in the sky dreaming  Yes I suppose we can day dream all day
t1_dufdbxk	0	*	What a fucking great outlook to life. I shouldn't ever think of solutions to problems, because I'm not qualified enough, and neither should people on the Internet or anyone in general.
t1_duf3k76	1	*	I think yall dumb if you gotta argue what sort of weapon nuclear bombs are.  Because they are both. They can be used to attack and they can be used to scare the shit out of enemies.
t1_dufg27p	0	*	You'd have to assume no one is talking to each other.
t1_duegcor	0	*	> Lol your so diluted dude. 
t1_dui1zos	0	*	Did you get interrupted mid-sentence, or does L stand for something in particular?
t1_ds6lpqs	0	*	Yeah, and that's a problem for Pakistan.
t1_ds6lkep	0	*	Funny, because it was the complete opposite during the Civil war.
t1_ds6fg51	0	*	What do you think the pillars of the sphere of influence and the strong economy are?
t1_ds699wx	1	*	Imagine his little T-Rex hands not quite reaching...
t1_ds64k94	0	*	On my phone,  thanks for the assist.
t1_ds78d7s	1	*	True, that was a bit of an attack!
t1_ds65eak	0	*	You know, I was gonna respond, but it seems you rewrote your entire comment, and it has frustrated me to the point that I don't even wanna bother.
t1_ds60vfw	1	*	It's just exploring pegging
t1_ds6bnpf	0	*	Thanks! I thought I'd write an essay on American foreign policy and global war profiteering, but I, too, think this was enough.
t1_ds7va2h	1	*	This imagining game has to stop
t1_dv0b50r	1	*	As a silent spectator, thank you.
t1_dv0ca19	0	*	Your comment makes no sense as a reply to my comment, mayhaps you should take a minute to try and comprehend the logical progression of the discussion I am trying to conduct.
t1_ds5apxh	0	*	you still don't make sense dude. 
t1_ds50mgp	0	*	They do? All of them? And to you that's equivalent to terrorism?  Get a fucking grip on reality buddy.
t1_ds5kdh1	1	*	I win all the debates, brother.
t1_ds736dk	0	*	> after you have been proven wrong  You have proved nothing. You are sound and fury, signifying nothing.  > Who do you think you will fool?  Nobody is reading this deep into a chain.
t1_dtz06k9	0	*	Clearly by your post history you are working for the Troll Factory in Russia  Clearly by the language used you are not native in English  Your arguments don't even make sense lol  Go rush B cyka blyat
t1_du2k30r	1	*	Bc my family cares and some live there.
t1_du2vbn8	0	*	Which could then also go the other way.
t1_dthr6t7	1	*	This is digressing quickly...
t1_dthae5l	0	*	Why did you ask that? Is there any possible answer he/she would give that WON'T leave you worse off for knowing?
t1_dtifxyg	1	*	What would you rather do, watch your parents have sex every night for the rest of your life or join in once for it to stop?
t1_dtg3vpi	1	*	I gotchya lol
t1_dtnxgab	0	*	Even hell doesn't cause that much sadness.
t1_dtoe5a6	0	*	This isn't a 4 year term this is a decision that will affect the future of the country long past any single elected government. It needs more backing than 37% of the population.
t1_dv4izf5	0	*	California and New York were prevented from controlling the election. And for good reason too. The popular vote never mattered. Didn't you learn that with Al Gore?
t1_dsqv7po	1	*	Ok! Your choice. Later.
t1_dt8np2w	1	*	The burden of proof is on the person making the claim.  Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence
t1_dt8fxrb	0	*	It will though. Illegitimate apartheid state on stolen land will crumble soon.
t1_dt8w1k6	0	*	>about to  So they didnt attack first is what youre saying?
t1_dt8t6lu	1	*	How about they relocate to said Polish town?
t1_dt8phi7	1	*	> People facing a genocide for the second time in a decade tend to fight pretty hard.  Nice delusions.
t1_dt8gebi	0	*	Actually it's completely the opposite, almost all the theocratic Muslim nations have a leadership that is propped up by Zionist/American imperialism. Enough with your false conjecture.
t1_dt8ewi1	1	*	Those are two very different situations. One the Israelis pulled out and the Palestinians immediately elected a party dedicated to genocide and Islam, and terrorism spiked. 
t1_dt95sv8	0	*	That's not going to happen.
t1_dud4i0c	0	*	Did GB know the nazis would have lost to russia?
t1_dudtleg	0	*	> diphenylaminechloroarsine   that can be used as a riot control agent.   Ohh noooo
t1_ducpv5t	0	*	A municipality board member is part of the government yet nobody infers any grandiose sense of power from that statement.  
t1_ducm91y	0	*	But acknowledging means they will be forced to pay for it because they are considered as the successors of the ottoman empire.
t1_ducuwqy	0	*	Sounds like he's talking more about the courage of Russian soldiers rather than using soldiers as extremely inefficient and very costly minesweeping fodder
t1_dsg8tcn	0	*	Yes. But there are many ethnicities that fall under the Iranian peoples umbrella.
t1_dunau81	0	*	If they'll touch men, but not women, they're being dicks. It might not be their fault that they're dicks, but that doesn't make them any less dicks. 
t1_dunb3lu	0	*	Cool, so we should treat mutilation of genitals, stoning and honour killings the same as a kiss on the cheek. Because you know, culture... Fuck off.
t1_dunkm48	0	*	> MP, easy misspelling and still should be respected in diplomacy  Writing PM twice and talking about authority? MPs don't have authority, PMs do.
t1_duplu7j	0	*	So who gets to decide what contact is sexual in nature ? Your obviously not Iranian as even the most atheist Iranian I have met has had some self respect for himself and the women in his life 
t1_dunbb3t	0	*	Have you considered that those fairy tales might be metaphors?
t1_dund7wi	0	*	I don't believe I said atheism is a religion, just that it might as well be.
t1_dsyl4t4	0	*	No good human being is willing to just deal with the fact that scum like you is celebrating comndemning sick children to death. You are the enemy and we will not show mercy.
t1_dsyus6q	1	*	Wreck the economy it is, then. 
t1_dsyk4m6	0	*	I just did. 44 dems voted to shut down the government.      **#SchumerShutdown**
t1_dsyjy1p	1	*	What? Why are you adding +4 more republicans lol. 51 is if *all republicans voted yes*. Your math has 55 republicans. Also, 5 voted no but one was for procedural reasons (McConnel). Your move
t1_du61smj	1	*	This is Reddit, specifically worldnews, please refrain from using logic in a discussion.
t1_du6uts4	1	*	I don't know what you are smoking, but I never suggested one aircraft carrier to do anything. 
t1_du6jhfg	0	*	Conscription is great in peace time. It's just when a war comes out of nowhere that people start to get upset. 
t1_du5wtft	1	*	They literally censor internet content that is negative about China's government.
t1_du6o5b0	1	*	Hey don't get used to it....  Guantanamo, Abu gharib, Tonkin, my lai, Mossadegh, Trump, etc etc 
t1_dswmqxn	1	*	Indeed it does!  Even you can understand how to become a Queen now.
t1_dsx6auj	1	*	It's treason then... 
t1_dswu0lg	1	*	Shut up!
t1_dsxt0jw	1	*	And pineapple on pizza is delicious. Fuck it, why not put anything and everything on pizza. One of the best pizzas I ever had had peaches on it. 
t1_dswzgfy	0	*	You mean jam donut.
t1_dswthxw	0	*	Nobodies really like the US at all. 
t1_dtkqu42	0	*	I doubt that can be applied to individuals, which is what I was arguing against. It's saying you can't accuse the government or the people collectively, which I don't think is in doubt.
t1_dtdnjeu	0	*	Against Trump, I meant. :P He's building up to the final charges.
t1_duuwnsq	0	*	Youre doing nothing while bitching on reddit? Lmao wow, way to be a bitch by your own standards. 
t1_ds8bl44	0	*	Feeling a sensation, and reacting to stimuli based on your physical composition is not the same. I suggest looking this up. 
t1_ds85w6i	0	*	Why is it illogical to remove meat proteins from a human diet? We don't need them to survive.
t1_duw9xlz	0	*	Just vote Democrat until the Republicans are all gone, then reassess. That's the sum total of the message.
t1_duxqozf	1	*	Reserves in Canada can be like 3rd world countries. We have Nazis as well. But I do agree, you have it worse by a long shot. 
t1_duvxcp5	0	*	I heard that if you REEEEEEEEEEEEEEE loud enough on the interwebz, the mean liberals will stop writing bad stuff about emperor Trump!
t1_duvz4lu	0	*	It's not faith. Unless you're arguing they're whole cloth fabricating 
t1_ds2k3nq	0	*	You missed China occupying Tibet, several countries occupying Kurdistan, Russia in South Ossitia (sp ?) and Crimea and I'm sure 20 others depending on who you ask. Whose land are you on?
t1_dszp2cs	0	*	When you start every talking point with lol it makes you seem childish and unintelligent, because you clearly aren't even considering the others' point. 
t1_dszqop2	1	*	If youre passionate about a particular issue, yes.  Voting with your wallet is a thing.
t1_dszk5jx	0	*	Cute.
t1_dt01ln2	1	*	By your rationale no one would invest in utilities. Their profits are tightly controlled and they seem to do pretty well. 
t1_dszn1c2	0	*	oh fuck off, go astroturf on another planet.
t1_dsztqlb	0	*	Though it has everything to do with your claim that other companies would have to raise prices by an amount equal to that of Papa Johns.
t1_dszvy1m	0	*	Do you have evidence he didnt do follow through? How did I misrepresent my source?
t1_dt0gg3n	1	*	Idk if I'd call Domino's pizza 'ok' 10 years ago.  It was pretty bad.  But today, damn, today I think it's the best delivery for the price.
t1_dszub5f	1	*	Youre a fucking clown.
t1_dsj9tqu	1	*	Fair point.
t1_dsjkug3	1	*	You're the one who made the claim so back it up.
t1_dsjefzm	0	*	I didn't say that sounds like a safe society.   Technically not a crime because there's no law barring that kind of action.  You understood my point just fine here.
t1_dsjixvt	0	*	Same in the UK, if someone has had too much they shouldn't be served.
t1_dsjfpxq	0	*	I specifically said that *wasn't* what a no go zone is - that's just a dangerous area of a city, which is different than a no go zone.  Try and keep up.
t1_dsjs30x	0	*	Darn never knew I was deluded
t1_dsj867f	1	*	That sounds like slavery, but with extra steps.
t1_dsjonnm	0	*	> As a Republican that is ashamed of my party  
t1_dsjmxmw	1	*	Wherever the blithering idiot President tells him too of course!
t1_dsjr8vj	0	*	That would work, but leftist in general would work better. American politics is based pretty far in the right wing.
t1_dsjhdbe	1	*	Some cyanide would certainly help, about 2 lethal doses? Sadly that's illegal. I'm not going to do it. 
t1_dsj939b	0	*	The fact that people need to own firearms to feel safe is troubling.
t1_dsjknrs	1	*	His lack of respect for them is likely based on some very valid reasoning. If someone's parents are abusive, do they deserve respect just because you have their genes?
t1_dsjhctq	0	*	From my point of view the soviet backed regimes are evil
t1_dsjakzh	0	*	So what, you're just going to come out here and discourage people? We lose sometimes so why even try?  You're surrendering the last inch you have to the forces you claim to be angry at!
t1_dsk951n	0	*	That's why I said in a democracy...  If you don't have a vote, it's not a real democracy and therefore a whole different ballgame. Like when women did not have a right to vote.
t1_dsjct2w	0	*	Which is why it's stupid that the ambassador and the right wingers are claiming it. 
t1_dsjaui0	0	*	I've lost you
t1_dsjn3o6	0	*	Because a leader wouldnt say something that isnt true for political capital?
t1_dsjg5bq	1	*	You would need an amendment to have proportional representation instead of a winner take all system like it is currently.
t1_dsjtvny	0	*	Yeah yeah whatever. Suppose I waste my time citing sources, not that i need any, you'll just attack the source. Nope. Not playing these bullshit games.   Btw, denial is a river in Egypt.  
t1_dsjl8s7	0	*	Bretbart.com, Donald Trumps tweet, all trusted sources
t1_dsjlcy7	0	*	Are you originally an American or are you a Dutch citizen?
t1_dsjj6zd	1	*	I don't blame you. It took me at least 25 years to even start following politics beyond voting every once in a while. 
t1_dsj8iu7	1	*	Good to know. Thanks!
t1_dsjedv2	0	*	Surely most don't think so, but my dad has literally repeated this claim to me verbatim on several occasions. I'm certain he's not the only person echoing this - as evidence, see the ambassador. 
t1_dsjevbz	1	*	The projection from the Trumpies never ceases to amaze me. Enjoy your fantasy world bud.
t1_dsjjpw4	0	*	Words have definitions.
t1_dsjstok	1	*	Because it'd be so much better if Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York decided how to run the entire country.
t1_dsj9r7t	1	*	A dorito republic
t1_dsjm2ce	1	*	Pretty well every country in the world has laws like that.
t1_dsjao4p	0	*	You know nothing about my political stance. Even so, I personally refuse to label t_d right or left. Just gives them validation. Admittedly I  accused /u/Syrinx16 wrongly. Sorry about that.
t1_dsjoa0n	0	*	Talk to me when you can explain how a 50-story steel building came down via office fires. 
t1_dsjomj0	1	*	You're probably right but I didn't feel like this under Obama. 
t1_dsjnawp	0	*	And there were more people to vote for than the two.  Vote your heart, not r or d.  There are others out there
t1_dsjxhpf	1	*	I never disputed that. Both are true, so why are you being so difficult about it?
t1_dsjjrs1	0	*	What laws in the Netherlands protects that as a right of the press? So anyone in the media can just demand a politicians time on command? What limits are there if thats not the case?
t1_dsjizrd	0	*	Dude, I'm mocking you.
t1_dsjjbg3	1	*	Dear god the irony in this statement is breathtaking.
t1_dsuydd3	1	*	That's a lot of edge and cynicism. 
t1_dskao1w	0	*	Lol so now you admit no go zones exist just not in your country. Typical. 
t1_dsjifzl	1	*	But you literally just confirmed exactly what I said, so my cardboard cutout analysis was spot on...
t1_dsjasgs	1	*	yeah clear.
t1_dsjifge	1	*	What are we disagreeing on?
t1_dsjj1c4	0	*	And if no go zones in the context of the article and overall discussion were real you'd have a point, but they aren't, so you don't. 
t1_dsjt7ez	0	*	So you guys have always had a big problem then with grenade attacks?
t1_dtz9sow	0	*	Sorry for making it relevant. 
t1_dsjor03	0	*	Don't pretend to know me.

t1_dsjdqsz	0	*	Well, I guess the rest of us will just  have to give them as much motivation as we can give so they can sue for change.  We live on the same planet after all.
t1_dsjji2j	1	*	Same thing in Norway except here you get fired and the pub/whatever loses their licence to sell alcoholic beverage for x amount of time, along with a fine. 
t1_dsjglnn	0	*	I'm watching it happen, and I doubt your actions are going to do anything to dispel that notion.
t1_dsjn92u	1	*	The National Park System is home to some of the most gorgeous parks in the world, it's worth looking up some to see if there's anything that catches your interest. 
t1_dsjct2p	1	*	Direct election of the President. Parliamentary systems, even ones with FPTP, allow for third parties because of governing coalitions. 
t1_dsjgof5	0	*	False and you know it.  You're just being contrarian because you're pissed that people called you out on a less-than-ideal parenting practice you espouse.
t1_dsjfmog	1	*	Well ... that's kind of how plutocracies work I'm afraid
t1_dsj7wsu	1	*	Fair enough.

t1_dsja95m	0	*	Oh I can. But you're too stupid to talk to, so I won't.
t1_dsjgjlp	1	*	That's the best response you have? Ignore everything I say and call it screeching? I'm talking to you, not to him. Things I'm not doing: running cheer squad for a nuclear arms pissing contest.
t1_dsjdsnl	0	*	>How most people arent true Republican nor true Democrat, but proclaim to be anyway?  You don't really get how political parties work, do you?
t1_dsjos20	1	*	They don't even take a lot of money. One politician in NJ sold out on net neutrality for like 6 grand....they sell out their own people for so little
t1_dskawi2	1	*	calling a place a shithole is not a liberal only thing...   Trump literally did it today
t1_dsjf1zq	1	*	The first past the post system, as it is now, is the overwhelming issue that props up a two majority party system.
t1_dska77w	1	*	The US is #43. Wow.
t1_dsj783r	0	*	Parents don't own you. He is not a brat or a sociopath, you are just insane.
t1_dsk0vsp	1	*	Loooool. Are you a Swede? Were you there?
t1_dsjm65t	0	*	Yes, as I said, this doesn't support your argument. Have you actually read it? 
t1_dsj9pr2	0	*	Care to explain how? Gerrymandering affects Congressional elections. The electoral college only acts in presidential elections, which are statewide and can't be gerrymandered.
t1_dsjjz96	0	*	just like how black police officers are race traitors? would love to see your reaction if a black judge sentences a black person to life in prison.
t1_dt281l9	0	*	Aren't you charming 
t1_ds7drld	0	*	Yes, it sucked and didn't have any useful effect. Why do you assume people don't know what smoking is like?
t1_ds81wj9	1	*	What else is there to enjoy? Nicotine is a stimulant which is why people enjoy it. 
t1_dsa7yif	1	*	That's probably not an easy thing to do, but I might be wrong. I guess it's possible, though
t1_du0c1kq	0	*	54 and much more life experience than you. Making fine jewelry and growing weed is going quite well, thanks. It's 75 degrees and sunny here.

t1_dv4g6hl	1	*	Nah, but it is a german shepherd. link me a pic?
t1_dv3ylxm	0	*	No it is. He can either drive for uber or drive as a cab driver. He will not get a job as a cab driver. So it stands as 0/h vs 15/h
t1_dv43pxb	1	*	Uh, I guess? It was just a joke man, I think you're reading too far into this.
t1_dv6x1w0	0	*	Uber should pay you for the day and then ban you from the app. I.e. you should be fired. Are you new to how employment works or something?
t1_dv4y5yh	0	*	What's that got to do with it?  Do uber drivers set thier charge out rate themselves?  No?  Then they are not independent contractors.
t1_dv4hyjh	0	*	Stuff it. That's a nice quote in terms of sports but real life doesn't work that way. 
t1_dv1ap0x	0	*	There were no tests to determine if there was a big bang 20000 years ago either.
t1_du5ddi2	1	*	You don't see anything weird with wanting to put mentally ill People in prison camps indefinitely? In Germany. By a hyper nationalist and bigoted party. 
t1_du5r8qw	0	*	Drug addicts that are convicts are confined? Are you mad?   Nobody gets life for beeing an addict. The wording is very clear.
t1_du689qt	0	*	I can read German and regardless of what you say it's still a strange thing to put in a political manifest.
t1_du6927r	0	*	Well he's probably worried Europe might turn into a shit hole like Saudi Arabia.
t1_du4wwax	0	*	>Far-right politics includes but is not limited to aspects of authoritarianism, anti-communism and nativism  I take it you aren't actually familiar with the modern GOP then.

t1_durrmf0	0	*	Dude what drugs are you on and where do I get some?   >Youre probably poor because you dont live in America. Here in America, all of us can give Gold because we are exponentially wealthy.     
t1_durnkk4	1	*	Sure. I obviously wouldnt oppose that.
t1_durlrlk	0	*	I think you over estimate it. Since this shit doesnt happen in other developed countries. 
t1_dur8jca	1	*	Working as intended for the NRA.
t1_duu5ihs	0	*	Because someone with a knife is as dangerous as someone with a gun? You're kidding, right? 
t1_dur7w2n	0	*	That's not what I said. I don't think guns should be taken away either.
t1_durnsdy	0	*	So how about a foreigner that visits three states in America over a year. Surely they saw more of it than you likely did?
t1_dusctv0	0	*	No no, keep lecturing me about how America works.

t1_dur81b4	0	*	That isn't even remotely close to what you said. 
t1_dutqoud	1	*	You are right.   Just another case of me mixing up the west and planet earth I guess :/
t1_duslqzd	0	*	Lmao even trump supporters get banned for not adhering to the talking points. You won't see that in any pro candidate sub
t1_dusazgw	0	*	That's a list of countries that gained independence, not a list of countries that tried.  
t1_duu5k05	0	*	> How am I being a dick?  > According to basic mathematics, which is larger 0 or 1?  You say that Australia's gun laws don't work, and at the same time you don't think they should be reversed?
t1_dus2dkb	1	*	I'd say knowing the same on average but I've noticed a general indifference towards politics from mainstream Americans. From the conversations I've had with Americans they just aren't interested. 
t1_durj1mu	0	*	Yep, just another statistic for each side to use as ammo in their own way. 
t1_durltda	0	*	So what we need is a blue ribbon committee
t1_dur934t	1	*	This is so true but sad
t1_durxokb	1	*	Most people don't understand that the media is one of the pillars of democracy and they have a vested interest in the proper functioning of their government.
t1_duraonr	0	*	Your false dichotomy aside, what do you prefer to republican democracy - where people decide how to run their country?    If the people do not decide what amendments to make who should?
t1_duu6zmu	0	*	who said anything about length? 
t1_dus5gom	0	*	Considering how closely related the US and UK are (we used to be the same nation, if I recall...) it's not at all surprising that we suffer some of the same issues. 
t1_durtl7z	0	*	I dunno, some people seem to think we're dodging bullets every time we go out to run errands.
t1_dureiu7	0	*	I love red staters - cities are violent cesspools full of violent communists, except when we start talking about guns. Then its all but think of the poor gang members! Dont forget about them!
t1_dus96ts	0	*	Which one was the huge mistake?
t1_durzws7	0	*	I wasn't taking any stance at all. My only point was I think that the media is just hyping up those kids for views. 
t1_dusd8h7	0	*	If they are natural rights, why do they only exist for US citizens?  Do you know what a natural right even is?
t1_dus6vli	1	*	There's a 'fat American' joke to be made here but I haven't had my coffee yet. 
t1_dusouce	0	*	That isn't whataboutism. It's a counterargument. Other countries face the same poverty and inequality, without the same massive gun violence problem. So you can't just blame it on that.
t1_durjwdv	1	*	It is .002%, which is equivalent to .00002 as a decimal. You forgot to multiply by 100.
t1_duryjgm	0	*	So your answer to these supposed abuses of govt power is to limit citizens rights further? I think if you are concerned w these abuses your time would be better spent tackling other issues.
t1_dusldn3	0	*	A certain gun you claim you want banned by using the wrong terminology and end up talking about guns that are already banned....

t1_duexvph	0	*	Um, how is calling you out for not being able to read subtle racism? Ffs dude, you are extremely dumb, I almost feel bad making fun of you. 
t1_dtahqmo	0	*	I definetely have not down or up voted any of your comments.  If you'd like to have a discussion on Trumps racism though we can get into it now, if you'd like? 
t1_duilgky	0	*	US has railguns and no it cannot tear apart an AC, you will see along with everyone else. It is going to be an utter rout of the Chinese of epic proportions :D

t1_dt1q6dl	0	*	It's not a profit potential. It's the only opportunity many young people have to make money/study in different towns.
t1_dugnma1	1	*	Did you come up with that response yourself or did you have to pay a team of writers a day's wage?
t1_duiesq1	1	*	Ok cool

t1_dui41ew	1	*	exactly.
t1_dumbomf	1	*	Damn this is actually a pretty apt response to the metaphor. Try to change the system and the system absorbs you and uses you to become more powerful and more efficient. 
t1_dui0zp0	0	*	The rich are hoping the can make it up the tech tree to kill bot army before anyone notices. 
t1_dui6p9g	1	*	But what do those jobs pay?

t1_dui9ztz	0	*	I know for a fact they've fallen.   What was 55k with the ACA became 52 then 50 and now 45-8 depending on the team you're in.  Without ACA you're looking at 40-45k.   
t1_dui1j0u	0	*	Yes, and there are rich that are allowed to stay rich regardless of bad decisions.  It's insane that someone with millions of dollars can declare bankruptcy. Lol.
t1_dui4lgv	1	*	The rich are better people than everyone else. - the GOP definitely.
t1_dui4ef6	0	*	That's not money. Zuckerberg does not have 50 billion dollars
t1_duibrva	1	*	You do as a collective whole, but would you donate 50 or 60% of your earning to someone else so they don't have to work? No you won't, and everyone w have to work. 
t1_dui9ntl	1	*	It was not the Americans that named it a genocide, it was the current Russian Ministry of Defense.
t1_dui8o8l	0	*	Um, seriously? I don't know I depressed myself a little while back when I thought up some convincing arguments in favor of child labor. Fuck this gay earth.

t1_dui2tv8	0	*	Why have they remained stagnant then, in Europe, as it appears? 
t1_duieeu4	0	*	No, it's not. And the fact that you think you know better than me is fucking laughable, especially when you're so fucking wrong it hurts. Read up on the Nordic model.

t1_dui7pg0	1	*	Sure buddy. 
t1_dui7mo9	0	*	Thanks. The most I can do with an online comment is offer a different perspective than what's prominent. It benefits me in no way to put substantial amounts of time and effort into proving something.

t1_dui600h	0	*	Except out poorest people live much better than the majority of other people in the world. 
t1_dui4ofn	0	*	Now how, specifically, does that target immigrants exactly? I mean, assuming you assign the same value to that of an unskilled laborer of european descent to one of say, indian descent.
t1_dui783z	1	*	Err...even middle class earners work those kind of hours. Some people work even more and see less than middle class earnings.  So what exactly is your point is saying they worked 80+ hours?
t1_duhy73k	0	*	Good news! You can always quit your job.
t1_dui39d4	0	*	How are they not different options?  If Local Pub hires you on a zero hours contract, that is different than registering at a temp agency for any work from any business.  
t1_dui1keo	0	*	And yet still could be vastly better if not for insane levels of greed and efficiency at all costs. We do not take care of each other.

t1_du0kebd	0	*	Oh I see, you're the person who simply repeats what other people say because you don't have the ability to respond coherently. You can go away now non-English speaking person...
t1_dttl1w3	0	*	That isn't what you said though. You said you want dissatisfied Iranians over educated Iranians. As in, if you have to pick one, you pick dissatisfied. 
t1_dtt2abw	0	*	The discussion here are made by informed Americans. The typical American, brainwashed by the mass media, still thinks of Iran as a backward allahhuackbar-AK wielding Muslims.

t1_dtt8dpv	1	*	Lol don't underestimate Reddit
t1_dtt6ks0	1	*	Well, at times the US acts like that title belongs to the rest of the world, so it's an easy mistake to make.

t1_dtu6k9t	1	*	That's not even much of an understatement, sadly.   Wonder how many CIA-sponsored coups were undertaken/planned that we don't know about. 
t1_dtt7paz	1	*	Who is it then? North Korea isnt even a regional power and Russia is buddies buddies with POTUS.  Is it Cuba? Tell me!

t1_dtt54jx	0	*	You still haven't actually addressed what I have said, you keep answering some other imaginary question...
t1_dtsx9h1	1	*	Theres Malaysia, Bangladesh and so on, too. Heck, I even met Chinese Muslims in Beijing (I am Lebanese btw)
t1_dttf7b6	1	*	It's a lot more disputed. It has a strong Shia majority and two Shia holy sites, but the Sunnis are still a lot more present than in Iran.

t1_dsgw7k7	1	*	Yes that happens, see the UK PM being held hostage over brexit
t1_dsekajv	0	*	Meaning that we aren't in the middle of some kind of conflict. Bush's high approval ratings were pretty much due to how he reacted after 9/11. Approval ratings can swing quite high and low during war.
t1_dseq148	0	*	Carter?
t1_dtw236j	0	*	 That law is dumb and overbroad then IMO.   Under those driving rules we shouldnt be allowed to eat, smoke cigarettes, or even converse with our passengers in the name of traffic safety. 
t1_dtv82cb	0	*	You greatly overestimate the competence of just about every driver.
t1_dsshvvo	0	*	Sounds like we're in agreement - my point was that Britain pretty much drew the borders as they stand today with little regard for the people already occupying those areas.
t1_ds4kg88	0	*	Letting in dangerous immigrants. Why don't you want the people of Germany to be safe?

t1_ds7lie9	1	*	Trump's personally working hard to deplete KFCs.
t1_dsq7wjj	0	*	No, there's relying entirely on luck (miracle) and then there's hard work no matter the statistic. Dude woke up for no reason, purely luck. Having your baby in the nicu isn't pure luck

t1_duircbi	1	*	I applaud that you bring level-headedness and reason to the conversation, even as I disagree with your position. Kudos.
t1_duiyb8s	0	*	You said it yourself : it is cosmetic and religious. No.medical reason, and of course as an infant, no way to choose if you want it or not  Other than religious and cosmetic reason there is NO reason
t1_dujeu5f	0	*	Why do you have so much contempt for a fully-functional penis?
t1_duiyror	1	*	Compared to other mutilations maybe but still more infectious and complications than leaving the foresking 
t1_dulh3fo	0	*	Well it seems now you cannot tattoo hildren And cut a part of their dick...
t1_duiivqn	0	*	people circumcised as adults didn't get to experience decades of rubbing against the clothes yet. The point is that circumcision at birth is a different story.
t1_duievpn	0	*	Why do your mention of proportions is OK but mine is not? Is that some kind of religious thing of yours?
t1_duif850	0	*	Are you kidding me? I don't quite understand how you defend mutilating baby genitalia. Do you also defend pedophilia  https://www.circinfo.org/USA_deaths.html

t1_duynoss	0	*	And which nation do you think is contender for leader on morality? 
t1_duz0753	0	*	We're talking about actual utility here, not just having fun shooting things. Guns provide nothing that society needs to function.
t1_dv0a4ux	0	*	How so? Do you not believe in the concept of self-defense?
t1_duz53pz	0	*	So why was the semi auto ban even an issue?
t1_duyjr7t	0	*	I didn't know we can't comment on anything that goes on outside the borders of our country, sorry. 
t1_duxptct	0	*	Oh, that's why you said that.   I don't think you're equipped for this.
t1_duxjz63	1	*	My point was that not adding a point about which weapons means they did not intend for future citizens to rely solely on weapons of the day.  Methinks you don't understand how law works.
t1_duz3hl2	0	*	The US military is designed to smash and destroy other militaries not conduct police actions.  You can look at Iraq to see how effective they are against a military and an armed population.   
t1_duycbz2	0	*	> This has nothing to do with being scared. But yes, I don't trust people who want to own guns. and support gun ownership  Then there's no dialog possible and I will just ignore whatever you say.

t1_duzcvns	1	*	Yes, I would truly love to be in a crowded place full of armed unknown people / s  
t1_duxzep8	0	*	Does that include the Swedes who are raped, robbed, and killed by gangs of Swedes in recent years?
t1_duyaqc6	1	*	There's nothing to suggest that.  Hunting is a tradition that is very much part of our culture.
t1_duxj2r6	0	*	What?
t1_duyin9l	0	*	Oh, I could also just have said Americans, but not all of them work like you do. There' some decent ones.
t1_duyk5j5	1	*	I think that's an oversimplification.  They have *far* fewer people there than here and are still able to withstand a protracted insurgency.  
t1_duz4btj	0	*	I live in the real world. Terrible people are still able to do shitty things, doesn't mean I think we should stoop to their level to stop them.  Also, super creepy to look up where I live.
t1_duy0h20	1	*	Japan has very strict gun control and an incredible suicide rate. This begs the question; what about their society makes them an aberration from peers given similar socioeconomic statistics?
t1_duyxrye	0	*	well why dont you ban guns from sale so you can find out?
t1_du90j7k	0	*	if you have anywhere from 88-92 dollars in your pocket, it is not lying to say you have 90 dollars. Rounding +/- 2% is pretty normal to everyone it seems but you.
t1_du9owh2	0	*	Have you seen the articles in the deficient aspects of the shitty stuff they do provide, didnt the Canadian government lose a law suit regarding their poor quality healthcare ? 
t1_ds9p8o7	0	*	>admits Germany bans insults  >claims Germany has free speech  I take it you're confused about what free speech is.
t1_ds9zhda	0	*	Why do totalitarians always hide behind democracy and free speech when they are not in power and ban both when they achieve it? You're not fooling anyone. Except yourself.
t1_dsflsh0	0	*	More pro-oppression whataboutism. Cute. When America starts telling satirists not to satirize things, you'll have a point.
t1_ds9rnnc	0	*	The government doesn't make laws in Germany AFAIK.  I understand your point. Basically it's a semantic issue right?
t1_dsg51b8	0	*	Like a ministry of truth?

t1_ds3rndv	1	*	> but he didn't conspire with a hostile foreign intelligence agency.  lol you're one of those dumbasses still on that conspiracy. Well that explains a lot. 
t1_ds3je0i	1	*	I think I'll concede the point. I'm wrong and thank you for taking the time to tell me more details.

t1_dsofh51	0	*	I've seen really crappy arguments for the Earth being round on the internet, that's a pretty poor barometer you're using.

t1_dt4yz7i	1	*	The point is that it would be viewed as bad either way, but the backlash would be less. He's not contradicting himself.
t1_dt37ows	0	*	As a Jewish person, I think you're an anti-Semite. So fuck you regardless of whatever sarcastic mental gymnastics you use to justify the things you say.
t1_dt3suu1	0	*	I thought a lot were deported there for criminal acts in the old world.
t1_dt3opiq	0	*	I think you're deliberately misunderstanding what I wrote.   Also, adding the disclaimer 'black skinned' before using the word 'aboriginal' is a pretty blatant kind of racist dog whistling, isn't it?
t1_dt3teb7	0	*	Station
t1_dt3qteq	0	*	Technically you have to outright kill them, which happened, but in the era of residential schools, it was technically a different atrocity. I've been a little obsessive with definitions lately.
t1_dt3lag0	0	*	They can stay there if they want, or they can go home to their safe home nation. The choice is theirs.
t1_dt3qrmo	0	*	Either your saying that we shouldn't let people without identification in or we should
t1_dt3ft3g	0	*	Oh so you just want to wait until jews have killed 6 million muslims before recognizing the human rights violation in a religious/racially targeted genocide as a serious issue?   
t1_ds6hh5z	1	*	you really need to learn what socialism is if you believe that.
t1_ds6d8h6	0	*	You must be real popular in gym class. 
t1_ds6fl7i	0	*	I do agree with you on principle but Homsexuality is a protected class in the state where that Baker resides. It's illegal to discriminate against protected classes.
t1_ds6c41n	0	*	You claimed that if facebook doesnt delete posts disagreeing with the governments migrant policy, they will get fined. That is fundamentally wrong, and certainly not supported by your sources.
t1_ds713vv	0	*	Everything I've said was in response to lumping into this mainstream media bs. So no. I don't want or need anything from you, random pseudo anonymous reddit user. Lol
t1_ds6sar0	1	*	They're all political leaders, just not all government leaders.
t1_ds7mn96	0	*	That cuts both ways, and we have no obligation to believe Facebook's claims.
t1_ds6g5x0	0	*	Close enough. But why even argue? Seems that to you all this is just a joke and as such apparently not something any government ought to regulate.
t1_ds6cnzo	1	*	I think it may have had something to do with the weapons and implied violence suggested by the joke. I'm not saying that I would have fined her for a joke, even like that, but there are grounds. 
t1_ds6jwvs	1	*	Because it wasn't talking about mob rule in that the most popular candidate wins, it was talking about mob rule through demagoguery 
t1_ds6eaxf	0	*	so you don't agree that it is rape because their definition is broader? 
t1_ds6gdi2	0	*	Who then in your mind should inform politicians about the needs of their industry?
t1_ds9bura	0	*	Tl;dr
t1_ds7bfrz	0	*	obvious troll is obvious.
t1_ds7igca	0	*	You're wasting facts on T_D users and Russian shills.   Best to just move on. 
t1_ds6dc1m	0	*	Are you joking?
t1_ds6n2z1	1	*	You handled this really well, though, so props to you
t1_ds70woo	0	*	Since you cannot enforce the ethics, who the fuck cares? Use another platform or make your own. You're distracting from the issue.
t1_ds6eln4	0	*	No it's not. If you're lying and spreading propaganda and misinformation you should be shown the door.
t1_ds8ea37	1	*	He owns a corporation. I honestly doubt he believe his private property should be abolished and his workers should all own the company, because thats what socialism is.
t1_ds6cqfs	1	*	You don't seem to know what it says yourself. What is it you call a meme here exactly?
t1_ds7eh8c	1	*	You can hate whoever you want. You can't incite violence against anyone. This is true in the US as well, by the way.
t1_ds75tpt	0	*	because it's clearly made for kids
t1_ds6ye9q	1	*	Nah they almost certainly would be overrun if they didn't ban non-supporters, just look at any minority-opinion sub that doesn't.
t1_ds6jwf2	1	*	There's Blue Origin if you've not heard of it lol
t1_ds6nohf	1	*	I agree. Its fun winding people up though.  Both companies are ruthless when it comes to business.
t1_ds6opno	0	*	People follow, that's the real sadness. They have choice.
t1_ds6fd3t	0	*	I took the comment to be a generalization of the way major networks sensationalize everything. *shrug*
t1_ds6ecmv	0	*	While I agree that freedom of speech is an absolute, I also think that we shouldnt be tolerant of intolerance. 
t1_dsbcqgh	0	*	Look it up. If you're not familiar with either of their politics don't even respond playing the idiot looking for information. People like you are the most annoying reddit has to offer.
t1_ds6csm8	0	*	Any chance you wonder what YOU sound like in this thread?
t1_ds7mavm	1	*	There's a difference in marketing to children and marketing to things children may like
t1_ds6jhkm	0	*	So terrorist and predophiles should be able to use social media as well?
t1_ds6vaxg	0	*	They created and own the servers that allow you to connect to and post to facebook. Denying you access to those servers is no different than me denying you access to my property
t1_dsi53j9	0	*	you realize we have organizations that take care of all of this for us?  all you have to do is anonymously tip them off, and they do all the work.   and they actually do.
t1_dshzh8f	1	*	This is exactly what I'm talking about.
t1_dsilge4	0	*	No, but it's a predictable reaction to extorting money from business's pockets. They still created this and have no right to complain.
t1_dstb1ed	1	*	Dude, you have to pay for a ticket everytime unless you have a metro pass. You literally have no idea what you're talking about stop embarrassing yourself like all socialist losers do.
t1_dsi5ufd	1	*	It's honestly pretty standard.
t1_dsixkep	1	*	It may have at one time but now you just get told you're not welcome back. A tip is such a required thing that some restaurants automatically add them to your bill.
t1_dsiya88	1	*	Because you know when businesses are exploitative, people flock to them, right?  I don't think you understand what slavery means.
t1_dshq1rk	0	*	I've never even seen snow, so I can't really relate.  But at least you guys have a cooler history, all we have are crappy national heroes and complete genocide of a native people.
t1_dsi4m42	0	*	so your answer to companies swindling their employees is other employees intimidating employees?   nice.
t1_dsisroa	0	*	I don't know about you, but after 13 years I get 4 weeks vacation and I am irreplaceable. I am not bloat, I am the MEAT. 
t1_dsi5x78	1	*	I negotiated a paid week off to start with and an unpaid week off along with it for my wedding. The best thing about this company is the 401k. Dollar for dollar up to 10%.
t1_dsjfc5d	1	*	There is no 4 or 5 weeks here, but the 401k is so good I'll stay as long as they keep me.
t1_dshqzco	0	*	That means you have one day of vacation for every ten days you work. Does that 30 days include national holidays?
t1_dsherqe	0	*	The boot straps are inordinately long. _
t1_dsi3pke	0	*	I was in the military. And just because someone else has it worse, doesn't mean I should have a shitty deal.
t1_dsi3neb	1	*	He owns the place, so whenever he wants.
t1_dsi3z0p	1	*	They usually dont have the same abilities though. They just overlook their fuckups in order to take advantage of the fact theyll work for less. Make no mistake, you get what you pay for.
t1_dsi66hi	0	*	Industrial Maintenance Electrician   The vacation isn't the greatest, but the 401k is dollar for dollar up to 10%
t1_dsi1lvw	1	*	winter is awesome. gtfo of my canada :P
t1_dsibfod	0	*	Actually, no. If I were implies present conditional or future tenses, whereas when describing a preterite event of the past in first person it's correctly conjugated as, If I was.
t1_dshg245	0	*	Uruguay, we get 20 days paid vacation + a vacation bonus pay intended to help people have nicer vacations.  Also having a thirteenth salary is pretty nice.
t1_dskv86a	0	*	Considering minimum wage is not meant to support a reasonable lifestyle, and in fact is meant for people in a transition phase, your friend is 100% correct. 
t1_duqg9qu	0	*	Clever, nice twist, you're good. what do they pay you for brownshirting.  I assume your child wasn't killed this past week.  I would love to see you read this to one of the grieving families...
t1_dtw7jv3	0	*	Just provide one reputable source then..
t1_dtw3huy	0	*	thanks for clarifying what you were talking about. As you can see there's plenty of countries funding the [green climate fund](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gcf_announced_funds_by_country.png)
t1_dtvtzf3	0	*	That's the get out an idiot would use!  I don't believe a word of it. You must think I'm as thick as you! 
t1_dtwrpjb	0	*	It is not 1B more growth. It is 1B fluid money lost.
t1_dtwk4w1	0	*	Negotiating with leverage is how you get what you want.  That's basic business.
t1_dtw7zhd	1	*	Neither of them provide any examples how criticizing leaders is banned. They are about content like *someone should rape and kill bitches like you you fucking whore*.
t1_dtvp3n9	0	*	Feel free to provide some when you make outlandish claims.  In fact, make it a practice to provide some form of substance whenever youre making such claims..
t1_dtw9aex	1	*	Your a complete idiot since you failed to grasp the point of the reparations comment.  Please go back and read further.  
t1_dtvxgwo	1	*	The figure is not tied to what the US is spending.
t1_dtws2ae	0	*	It would be the same. He waited months to back out anyway - no different.
t1_dtvax9o	1	*	Political union. Not workers union. It is called European Union after all.
t1_dtvatdq	0	*	So you think damaging the country if you dont get what you want is acceptable...
t1_dtvoxu4	0	*	> Not to mention that socialist dictatorships led by competent leadership with a long term vision  Ok well you're the enemy.  No point in continuing this discussion.
t1_dsaqfhy	0	*	The US did hit a legitimate hospital in Afghanistan.
t1_dss1yiq	0	*	Really? What did he say?
t1_dtvipz1	1	*	You have a political position, I have a factual position.
t1_dsxg0mb	0	*	Ah yes PR types means something very different.  I love it when dumb people think they're clever.
t1_dsxg5kq	0	*	LOL no you haven't.  One rehosted msn article and a bunch of right-wing blogs.    Invest in your education. 
t1_dsxf2mw	0	*	The fact that you can't conceive of objective news is fucking sad.  Grow up, champ.
t1_dsxdrgn	0	*	[Russian propagandists are promoting it](https://dashboard.securingdemocracy.org/) is more accurate which is severe cause for skepticism. 
t1_dsxfnov	1	*	Yeah let me grab my Rolodex and hit up the CEOs. 
t1_dsxgg9j	1	*	I know. I post for others to read the facts. These people are brainwashed or willful liars. They must be challenged or the country will stay fucked. 
t1_dsuyt08	1	*	How was Sanders more right wing than the ALP? What is TYT?
t1_dtr1qyk	0	*	The twisted words of an Iranian agent. Well played. Or are you Russian? 
t1_dt2ipy2	0	*	> more money than me  That is a serious understatement. Its not about communism or having more money. Its about a serious disbalance in income equality.
t1_dt46yag	1	*	U0001f610
t1_dt35i31	1	*	Not housing tho 
t1_dud0pgt	0	*	Well we are looking *right now* at the negative consequences. A biosphere that is literally dying in front of us. Is that really worth the *e f f i c i e n c y* capitalism provides? 
t1_dud9gdb	0	*	Nah, that would be a possession, not private property. Abolishing capitalist private property would be not allowing me to own things I can't personally use, which I'm fine with.
t1_dud0qrw	0	*	Of course? The solution is to remove it from the equation, because as it stands it's what's between us and fixing the environment.
t1_dud6nbn	1	*	And the people that arent benefitting it and want to change the system usually get destroyed by those at the top before anything sways too far out of their favour. 
t1_dudelhl	0	*	I guess after the French overthrew the monarchy, and Napoleon gained power, they should have just abandoned the idea of a republic. 
t1_dundzv1	0	*	The issue does die with the gun because nobodys talked about a mass stabbing (I may have misinterpreted your comment)
t1_duof5so	1	*	Correct. Will look into the stats later.  Something obviously needs to be done about America's crime rate, both gun-related and not gun-related, as you rightly point out.
t1_dthj73j	1	*	Alan takes care of firings.
t1_dtg9c1t	1	*	OP is incredibly stupid
t1_dtf4ma7	0	*	Arizona, new mexico, alaska, souther california.   3 states dont have water sources and the other is like the yukon. Humans can live anywhere. There are far more un-hospitable places than the yukon.
t1_dscznd7	1	*	The soviet union had a solid manpower advantage, and was younger than it is now. They 'won' through using that manpower advantage, at great cost. 
t1_dsc2jcs	0	*	Belfast was heavily bombed, as it is part of the UK. Dublin was bombed once cause they thought they were in Belfast. 
t1_dsc5uwv	0	*	Except the US wasn't friends with both sides the whole time, their trade favoured Britain to a ridiculous degree 
t1_dsc4l2r	0	*	Yes, but Hiroshima and Nagasaki were both destroyed with only 1 bomb each as opposed to squadrons of planes firebombing the cities.
t1_dsc1wkp	1	*	I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed 
t1_dsbvhjq	0	*	Which is exactly what he said.  But you don't buy your stuff from your enemy.
t1_dsdec7c	1	*	The McCollum Memo alone shows that the US had a hostile stance against Japan before Pearl Harbor.  Oh, and the fuel embargo.  
t1_dsbw7vv	0	*	Most Americans don't get this.  If China stopped trade with the US, we would lose our technology suppy overnight.
t1_dsc05y1	1	*	No...
t1_dsc4sek	1	*	True love
t1_dsc5g1p	0	*	My God, how could that heathen do that. It made every comment he produced meaningless./s
t1_dscwh0h	1	*	Finland is not in NATO, neither is Sweden.  So why on earth would Russia invade Finland or Sweden? You guys live in a fantasy world.
t1_dsc1fbm	0	*	Neither Finland nor Sweden are in NATO...
t1_dsc1mey	1	*	Hahaha I just want the best for you I'm stealing that to correct grammar
t1_dsc2jjq	0	*	The size of Russia was their biggest advantage, and probably the only reason they survived the German onslaught.   Modern aviation pretty much makes it irrelevant. 
t1_dsc6mso	0	*	I mean in operation downfall, the alternative 
t1_dsc24wq	0	*	My guess is, english is not their first language.
t1_dsc6o87	0	*	reminding me I should preorder that right now
t1_dsc6wyx	0	*	It bothers me we have there and their at all. The fuck is the difference? English is a cluster fuck of a language.
t1_dsc666n	0	*	On the geopolitical stage, because that's only what I'm referring to, geopolitical experts.
t1_dsbpn5z	0	*	I don't disagree, but we should assume they would be a real threat and plan accordingly. I hope we never have to go to war in the first place.
t1_dsbvicb	1	*	Which is exactly what he said.  But you don't buy your stuff from your enemy.
t1_dscc9dj	1	*	India would be one but your right there aren't many at all. Which is also why NATO countries need to improve military spending.   Edit: Probably wouldn't win but could stalemate Russia. 
t1_dsd6qpl	0	*	The heap is dark and full of errors - Intel
t1_dsc1yv0	0	*	Why do you assume typos mean someone is stupid? They could be dyslexic or speak English as a second language 
t1_dsc6djo	0	*	Where does Sun Tzu speak of total war? 
t1_dsc44c3	0	*	His response is perfectly thought out, so wat if he typed something wrong on an informal Internet forum. He likely knows exactly what he did wrong. You grammar nazis really are in a league of ur own 
t1_dscsl1u	0	*	Most couteous!
t1_dsccctz	1	*	Also, since it's out there - the correct term is likelihood
t1_dsc4omb	1	*	You could deploy 100k troops and occupy a vast majority of the country. The US could stomp out that problem if they really really needed to, its just the cost is not worth it.
t1_dsd70bo	1	*	I can't imagine being able to not piss myself and run in that situation
t1_dsdsh3a	1	*	Thanks, me too.  And likely hood for likelihood.  I agree the comments seem well thought out, with relevant details, but these basic grammar errors bother me, too.
t1_dsco0mf	0	*	Other than Germany, Japan, England and Australia which really only traded with allies and did become rather insular.
t1_dsbw9z9	1	*	No, they will claim large parts like Vancouver for themselves.
t1_dsbvtw5	0	*	The difference is in making it part of the state.
t1_dsekthj	0	*	>compulsory democracy   Do you get jailed for not voting?
t1_dsbvuub	1	*	As a Canadian I wish our politicians where willing to do the same.  Good thing Trump is helping us diversify our exports away from America with his tantrums.
t1_dsc2dwf	1	*	I was thinking the same exact thing! The rest of the response seems so calculated and knowledgeable and that in the middle is like a big record scratch. 
t1_dsc1wi0	0	*	You would be surprised how much of British history is driven by insurance law.  Source: insurance lawyer.
t1_dsc6meb	1	*	So which part of that response addresses the economic issue of exports? 
t1_dscf2cv	1	*	Possibly dyslexic. Its hard to get them right on the first go. 
t1_dsc3vv7	1	*	Taiwan's annual growth is doing fine, so why do you think that their economy will suddenly fall?
t1_dsc0810	0	*	Its okay he's not the smartest. He just wants you to think he is.
t1_dsbz59o	0	*	Are you sure 'wise' is you final answer?
t1_dscg1su	1	*	They used horsepower because they were desperate for trucks.
t1_dsc1tfq	1	*	Well, to be fair, it already did. 
t1_dscnls2	1	*	thank you. 
t1_dsc45j2	1	*	STFU filthy lumpenproletariat
t1_dsc6zzy	1	*	There their...its ok.
t1_dscail7	1	*	Also likely hood
t1_dsc6wpq	1	*	The size of a trading partner's economy matters to China, which is what we're talking about.
t1_dsc4k37	1	*	Came here to say exactly this. 
t1_dsc0bi8	0	*	We get it. Devils advocate. It would be nice if you could make sense of the rest of your comment for us though.

t1_dsby5it	0	*	It is indeed, generally speaking the commies in Vietnam were not baaaad commies, the ones in Cambodia were horendous sick fucks
t1_dsdi4qn	1	*	> GDP is irrelevant here.  Not when we're talking about what ***CHINA*** will do.  Why are so many people overlooking that?
t1_dsesaxg	1	*	You cant be more American than this, holy fuck, turn off Fox News.
t1_dse55zw	0	*	I'm so sorry about your blindness/lack of reading comprehension. Get well soon :)
t1_dsbwzb9	0	*	Belfast is part of Britain. The German bombing was no mistake; Belfast is known for its shipyards. There was a significant manufacturing sector for German bombers to target, as well. 
t1_dsc5m45	1	*	slavery wasnt dope?
t1_dsc3558	1	*	Sounds kinda familiar.
t1_dsc4y0u	0	*	I know, but it was about staying true to the saying. If there is a bridge(destroy it) or if there isn't a bridge(build it). I know his code is more efficient, but that's nit what i was going for
t1_dsc7zf4	0	*	What do you reckon the line in the sand is?  A Polish invasion would be met forcefully, But anything east of there I don't see us going to war over.  The Ukraine was the dry run.

t1_dv089ny	0	*	You're right, I got the terms mixed up. My point though is that in the US the government cannot seize your land for just any reason and without compensation.

t1_duzyltx	1	*	Where in the policy does it say to murder white farmers?
t1_dv0578q	1	*	That is the lesson. As a government you can't rely on other nations to cover for your fuck ups. Hopefully it'll force them to rethink the path they're on
t1_duzu9x2	0	*	Saying that the millions of Mexicans immigrating are rapists and murderers but maybe there's some good ones is about 99% on the dot there. Are you usually this purposely obtuse?
t1_dv048x6	1	*	Africa wouldn't have much contact with the outside world unless they flew in white people that taught them all about electricity.  Think about the practical implications of what you are saying, lol
t1_duzxh1l	0	*	Nah man our ruling class still doesn't care for us. As long as we work hard for them they are content. This is a plutocracy m8
t1_duzzz18	0	*	Not if you turn to crime

t1_dt7fucp	1	*	^ Everyone should read gulag archipelago
t1_dt7bss5	1	*	I cant deny that. Hes a bastard that deserves a brutal anal fisting daily, but at the same time those poor North Korean people have been tortured for long enough. 
t1_dt7l57t	0	*	Be careful about making moral judgements on people based on their political beliefs. Saying that all communists are evil is similar to the communists saying all property owners are evil, isn't it?
t1_dt7cf09	1	*	That beer belongs to me now - Kim Il Sung
t1_dt7sty0	0	*	Their right? Yes.  But I still prefer the German outlook. Being willing to make sacrifices to help others is an admirable quality, whether done as an individual or a society.

t1_dt7ut5a	1	*	I think the TSA jokes are mostly because all comedians do is fly around the country and stay in hotels. 
t1_dt7qj49	1	*	You taken it out of context. He said they'd look hypocritical for saying that America is their land to the Mexicans, when they want to come over. 
t1_dt7e1i3	1	*	Dude, youre right. If someone compiled a NK humor/folk-tales volume and had good annotations, Id read the hell out of it
t1_dt7icyr	1	*	Sorry for my people.  
t1_dt79a0b	0	*	They wouldn't allow reunification either. Not on terms remotely acceptable to South Korea. We're discussing what some South Koreans want anyhow. Doesn't need to be likely.

t1_dt7afbi	0	*	Bro? You still there? Bro?
t1_dt7cw33	0	*	For now. But NK could turn into another China or Vietnam in a decade if relations were opened. They could be making all of our t-shirts even cheaper with all those people starving for jobs.

t1_dt79eh6	1	*	Ah, no. They decidedly do not. You're quite right about that.
t1_dt7erbq	0	*	The amusement and surprise (in my opinion) also applies to the reporters, hence their laughter.  But we'll just have to agree to disagree on that point since neither of us are mind readers.  
t1_dt7r3kl	0	*	Heres the thing though, dude. You werent being bombarded by triggered people, and its not people just being politically correct.   Your views are just bad and out of touch. 
t1_dt7iwcp	0	*	No, its confirmed and its really disappointing. There have been at least 50 threads on the matter over at r/NBA

t1_dt79dbv	1	*	Reunification isn't any more likely though. Not only would China not allow it, neither government would be remotely interested in letting the other side take over.
t1_dt7efg9	1	*	I know that a while ago they apparently banned sarcasm because people would apparently call others fools who cannot see the outside world as a jab at the leader.

t1_dt7yji0	1	*	What I meant is that the time argument is not valid, since they're way faster adopting modern ideas for technology than for politics.
t1_dt79ob3	0	*	I mean it can't be more cruel than their current situation. You can wind down military spending and improve basic welfare and education and most will be happy enough not to uproot their entire lives

t1_dt4mmne	1	*	And you fail to understand that there is a global economy.
t1_dt4onpj	1	*	Wages are stagnant and stuck while prices rise. Higher wages would be better for everyone. Manufacturing wages were higher, retail wages are lower. Simple math.
t1_dt4q10r	1	*	Yes, he is full of shit. I agree. ID politics is a cancer on western civilization encouraged by our adversaries through ideological subversion.

t1_ds2t300	1	*	Or they can drag the baby away due to the seats being overbooked
t1_ds3ajww	1	*	Also you are making a bad point. This was not a legislation he signed. It was a temporary ban the Homeland of Security enacted with the TSA. There was no signature or legislation required for that. 
t1_ds3hbrn	1	*	That at least is National Enquirer levels of dumb, so I can laugh. It's why I used to go to /r/conspiracy before they became the runoff sub for T_D.
t1_ds3arpe	1	*	It wasn't legislation, so technically im still correct. He has signed zero new laws regarding airline safety. 
t1_ds3m7x9	0	*	i made a post on the_donald which reached their front page and made a post which reached top of enoughtrumpspam, not banned from either
t1_ds37i4k	0	*	It's not like she was wrong about Racism Frog.
t1_ds39trh	0	*	I pretty much exclusively use RedditIsFun, so I don't have to deal with those shenanigans.
t1_ds3drxr	1	*	There can still be accidents with laptops although they are a pretty uncommon. Sure you can say what did trump actually do but to say he is claming everything is just a bit silly
t1_ds30mtd	1	*	Sorry, I meant countries that have *no means* of granting citizenship through parentage. I don't think there are any such countries (except for the Vatican which doesn't count).
t1_ds3712m	1	*	Ah wow. Didn't know Big Air Traffic Control (or whatever the ATC lobby is actually called) was a thing. Makes more sense, then.
t1_ds37n12	1	*	War of 1812. Although it's probably just a pun because his name is MADison
t1_ds3ejme	0	*	Don't you only get that automated message if you've had activity in that subreddit?
t1_ds4jasb	0	*	Did you even read the first comments? If you cant follow thought with that logic which as easy as 1+1=2 then you are lost
t1_ds32yak	1	*	Cool statement but this has literally nothing to do with right wing comments not in T_D about trump cant be sarcastic but left wing can  
t1_ds3f7h4	0	*	Oh shit you're right! Hah, oh well :D I have Parks and Rec fever these days so I totally read it as Ron Swanson! Though Ron Howards tower is bigger!
t1_ds53hk3	1	*	I really hope you're right. If enough people get out and vote it could really backfire hard for them! 
t1_ds38398	0	*	You can disable it by console (F12) or by disabling custom subreddit themes in your preferences. The latter lets you downvote, too.
t1_ds2t08u	0	*	Now?
t1_ds3ahhv	0	*	Terror attacks on airliners aren't counted in the statistics of accidental aircraft deaths. Reading comprehension....

t1_duxtv50	1	*	This interaction is really strange to me, man. I don't think we have compatible viewpoints and I don't think continuing to converse will get us anywhere.
t1_duxqwyh	0	*	Based on your comments, you're a patient person. Good for you - that's a virtue I don't have. It might be a good idea to not feed the trolls through...
t1_duxop2p	1	*	If anything I could see that this was a carbomb  But I thought, nah forget it, yo-ho to Bagram!
t1_duxlq68	1	*	Yep you're right I don't know 
t1_duxsrnp	0	*	Well, I didn't see the typo until you pointed it out, so I think I'm gonna leave it up cause it apparently bugs you so much.
t1_duxyk5b	0	*	literally England?
t1_duxmxvp	0	*	Yes because in the Bible god said women are less then men so they have to wear bikini U0001f602

t1_duxs5t2	1	*	????????  Which of Breitbart and Daily Mail do you think is definitely not right leaning? 
t1_duzq59o	0	*	Your comment is just ignorant of history.
t1_duxow1y	1	*	Are you saying that Christians believe that men and women are different? Sjw's have told me otherwise.  
t1_duyj1bp	0	*	Framed by whom?  At this point I would question the source.   
t1_duxvo8t	0	*	Yeah nice fallacy there guy, relating religious people to Nazi's as if that same observation even makes sense in that context. 
t1_du2d8wv	1	*	You clearly have a reading comprehension problem.

t1_dsim4k7	1	*	Id eat peaches every day
t1_dsi2x5d	0	*	I already have. Russia shot down a passenger plane accidentally, the US shot down a passenger plane accidentally. Same thing.
t1_dsiagqh	1	*	Of course they are. The fact that you owned up to it doesn't make it even a little bit okay. People died in both cases, it's the same thing. Apologizing and paying a fine does not make it all right. 
t1_dsicfb3	0	*	I'd eat peaches every day.
t1_dsiu241	1	*	Looks like well over $100 as of last year: https://medium.com/@Rob79/what-i-learned-selling-my-reddit-accounts-c5e9f6348005  Sorry for the shit formatting, on mobile.
t1_dsjbnys	0	*	Jesus Christ, dude... You just don't get it. Is it hard to breathe with Russia's cock so far down your throat?
t1_dsj9hss	1	*	Millions of peaches... are not for free.   ...thats called theft you little cunts
t1_dsicpub	0	*	They think Russia would penetrate most Europe?  They got embarrassed by their performance against georgia...
t1_dtelzbm	0	*	> Along with billions of euros.  Is it a fact?
t1_dtev5vf	0	*	To fall of 'normal' Ukraine
t1_dtduz0h	0	*	Turkey is part of NATO.  If Russia declares war (or just invades without declaring war) a NATO country, it is indeed very likely that they won't be allowed to pass the straits anymore by Turkey.
t1_dt2y80f	1	*	I hadn't realized that we were talking about a personified Death. I meant that you can't use dying to relieve the status of being dead.
t1_dt3qz3x	1	*	There's still heat death coming.
t1_dt2xuo4	0	*	Anti-government radicals are also considered terrorists if they commit terrorist acts. Why don't you think they're Christian?

t1_dtt8kmd	1	*	Go for it man. It'll stop em from fucking over other honest folks in thr future, just be careful and keep a bigger stick.
t1_dtrzm4g	0	*	Yeah Kenya, why dont you get a nice and fancy hi-tech land registry?  Meanwhile here in Canada theres been a lot of talks about disbanding the firearm registry because its fucking expensive.
t1_dtsktok	1	*	Maybe people from your circle would like to visit my place for a week or so?
t1_dtscu73	0	*	Whose to say how small their little minds are? They could be quite volumous. 
t1_dtsfylj	0	*	So why are you tipping...?

t1_dts4i0i	0	*	It's not a competition. Just because someone's not a vet doesn't mean they can't do great things. She's saved the lives of many animals which is not something just anyone can say they've done.
t1_dtsghfn	1	*	Yeah I know I over-inflated it I was just trying to relate it more to my joke. =/
t1_dtsequc	1	*	Hello pot, this is the kettle calling.
t1_dtsbs8q	1	*	humans have always been my least favorite animal   
t1_dtskolb	1	*	Somewhere in the distant future, our descendents will say the same about the animals we have today after they've gone extinct...
t1_dts0gzr	0	*	I absolutely agree. I'm just saying we don't have corruption ingrained in our culture and way of life.
t1_duxjmob	1	*	When was the last time you were there? I was there last month and could access reddit fine without a VPN. 
t1_duy8yya	1	*	>There is no divide and there is no hate for other ethnic groups   LOL   You were doing pretty well until you said the dumbest thing ever.  
t1_duxn014	1	*	Never been to those subs
t1_duycb6e	1	*	Why are you trying so hard?  Remember the idiom, The silent toad catches the fly.  There's advantages for China to be seen as good or bad. Don't have to change everyone's mind.
t1_duyni68	0	*	Wrong.  It was verified by **MANY** others that Google censored it.  It was less than an hour before any search worked with gun in it and once it did, it worked again for everyone.
t1_dv0fnni	0	*	So is Russia a democracy?
t1_e13ammr	0	*	You cam't change your race or ethnicity.
t1_dv0u3xn	0	*	Read what I wrote again. You didnt comprehend a word of it. You can run the same RATE for 6 or 8 hours. RATE RATE RATE. Key word. I speak precisely. Read carefully. 
t1_dv0myre	1	*	I make six figures and don't think like this at all. Probably don't equate successful people with your worldview where you have to live to work, not work to live. 
t1_dv0izz8	1	*	More than once actually. I don't know if it's brainwashing or just ingrained in the American psyche.
t1_dv0k9zt	1	*	The issue isn't work first it's work only. Working 9-5, 5d/w is fine. 9-9, 6d/w is not.
t1_dv0yvim	1	*	Can totally relate 
t1_dv0lf2g	0	*	How many, though? How many people, if told you'll get paid the same if you show up or not would actually bother to come in? 
t1_dv16k68	1	*	I didn't know this was a thing. After being on Reddit for almost half of my shift, it seems that I am not alone. 
t1_dv0dj9v	0	*	Hmm okay. So if I vote and they count it that is democracy?
t1_dv0ksrk	1	*	Problem is not the taxes, it's what they are used for.
t1_dv0j6hd	1	*	It wasn't the taxes that were the issue it was not getting to voice an opinion on them/vote on them. 
t1_dv0uihg	0	*	What's so hard about programming? All you code monkeys do is type really fast on your computer all day and go on websites! It's so hard. Sad!
t1_dv1bax2	1	*	Or 0.7 seconds.
t1_dv0kvi8	0	*	Uh obviously. But you also have rate targets and underperforming workers get reprimanded. So thats not evidence to your point. In fact it has nothing to do with it. 
t1_dv0f4rd	0	*	Electing people to make decisons for you is the mark of a republic, not a democracy.  Democracy would be everyone voting on everything that goes through Congress.
t1_dv0k4bi	0	*	In theory, not in practice. For many reasons.
t1_dv0g21n	0	*	Nah, just spent several years studying industrial engineering...
t1_dv1m52i	1	*	Yep. Meant to be managing millionaires finances but instead I googled random facts 9 hours a day. Ask me anything, I can tell you more about ants than I can about finances/accountancy.
t1_dv113oi	0	*	You choose to make working life out to be slavery   That is also your choice.
t1_dv0rcdc	0	*	https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/republic  Just read the definition you fucking idiot
t1_dv12k2c	1	*	You're ignoring the part where everyone works insanely high hours and there is no substantial payoff except for few..
t1_dv2chio	0	*	Why would I be ?
t1_duplfaq	0	*	AH1?
t1_dt6ymbs	0	*	In jouw geval wel, ik leef al jaren zelfstandig... 
t1_dtxntlt	1	*	I see what you mean. Not trying to be a dick but it was pretty hard to see that seeing as how you didnt provide any context to your comment just a link.
t1_du4m001	0	*	But it's slower. And as I explained, sometimes it's a good thing to hear about something. Sometimes manipulation is good.
t1_dul8tm7	1	*	Bleh, I wasn't clear enough in my post. I mean that individuals and their wallets/accounts can't be insured. Of course a real-money online bank can have insurance for itself.
t1_du4dglz	1	*	It's a mix of both.
t1_du4lrt7	0	*	Yes, but that means that a government can't print more than it can honour.
t1_du6eb7p	0	*	And not having specifics with advertising means what for you in advertising?
t1_dsuu15h	0	*	> Trump had **EVERYTHING to do with** the fall of ISIS. He picked **the guy who won the war**.  
t1_duq64ur	0	*	Just as soon doesnt mean before; if I had said well punish him after you punish the Chinese tourists youd be right, but you continue to be wrong no matter how hard you try.
t1_dujbnkn	1	*	Weirdo.
t1_dsnw4np	0	*	You don't understand logistics. Obviously it's easier to take one bulk steal than to have to steal gather and organize raw data. Thanks for attempting to insult me while looking foolish. Good day bro 
t1_dsnvb5i	0	*	Do you even know what happened or did you just hear it on fox news?
t1_duy0p6d	1	*	His equivocations are really rather sad...
t1_duzpjuq	1	*	Point of order:  The Earth isn't in a clear box.
t1_dt3h6gw	0	*	Being a hypocrite doesn't make someone wrong. It just makes them a hypocrite. 
t1_dt5njft	1	*	The information came from his own source. Technically I was paraphrasing what the article stated, but regardless the OP clearly didn't read it, which is probably the bigger concern.
t1_dt3nhrw	0	*	u shxfcld start eating lab grown meats my man, and get rid of the rubber tires on ur EV for sum organic wood hweels.
t1_dt3o3hf	0	*	america too will be reducing tarrifs, its a common strategy... 30% 1st year, 2nd year is 25% and it keeps falling, its to ramp up production in the US...
t1_dv3v03y	0	*	I'm sorry, I'm a little slow and geography ain't my strong points. Thanks for explaining it though. I appreciate the effort!
t1_ds1lo4s	0	*	They won't be safe, they'll be the next target. The best they could hope for is that we give Japan and SK nukes so they can have their own deterrent.

t1_ds1d9ie	1	*	Not so sure. Jet stream goes east.
t1_ds1odbv	1	*	This is why you can't let Seattle get hit, it would destroy the movie/tv industry because of the fallout up here.
t1_ds1esco	0	*	Im just curious then, whats your frequented news source? 
t1_ds14v0q	0	*	How about northern Canada? Say a 12 hour drive north of the Idaho USA/CAN border? 
t1_ds16yn9	0	*	Elon Musk and Tesla swoop in with another wholesome PR move and construct a Tesla Hyperloop throughout LA in exchange for ownership of the Lakers.  Edit: throw in the Clippers too.
t1_ds19xjm	1	*	Nice try, Captain Price
t1_ds1ynf3	0	*	But if the thing is armed is there no risk of setting it off by trying to destroy it...?
t1_ds192dw	0	*	Correct, but it does basically turn it into a high-altitude dirty bomb.  All things considered I'd rather not have one of those in my back yard.
t1_ds143sm	0	*	They are better than what happens to the country that tried to nuke you.    Mutually assured destruction isn't much of a threat if one party doesn't get destroyed.  
t1_ds19j9f	0	*	I can never get these right. The bottom keeps burning because the water boils off too quickly, or the top gets soggy, or the top steams properly but the bottom doesn't get seared and crispy.

t1_ds1hjco	1	*	Noooooo
t1_ds1eyih	0	*	It's a well defined economic system that's been the predominate mode of production for the last few hundred years. As an ancap, you should know it well enough to defend it.

t1_ds1c8wl	1	*	You win some you lose some.. but you live.. you live to fight another day!

t1_ds1b84l	1	*	The brave hawkish attitude of someone who has no fucking clue of what they are talking about.
t1_ds2bi7t	1	*	Maybe we can get some lawyers with experience in bird law to weigh in on this important discussion?
t1_ds1a2a7	1	*	And even higher rents 
t1_ds13o40	1	*	Lol, and what is your point? We live in a capitalist society. Do you seriously expect them to push socialist/communist ideals?
t1_ds1ac8t	0	*	Why don't we just tell them they can do what they want with California, you know, just in case?
t1_ds14ytf	0	*	Wikipedia says 17,500 mph.  5 miles a second is pretty fucking fast.

t1_ds1cq29	1	*	 Hah
t1_ds1asae	1	*	That'd be just one nuke. I doubt in the event of an all out nuclear war any of the involved parties would just launch a single nuke lol

t1_dt7dr0l	0	*	Sure dude, whatever you say.
t1_dsetvrz	0	*	Nah, I succeed quite a bit. Wouldn't be where I am in life if all I did was fail, but maybe bigots just have a higher standard to aim for. What do I know anyways?

t1_du1qu4b	0	*	Correct, reality has not changed no matter how fervently you press your false claim.  
t1_du1ohbp	0	*	Right. Were comparing modern China to modern America. If you want to compare 1960s China to 1960s America, its still not gonna look pretty.
t1_du1umxr	1	*	Please elaborate on how the Chinese people choose how they are governed.
t1_duc84ih	0	*	Yeah, it doesnt get that much information 
t1_dst4gwt	0	*	Someone missed the boat. BTC is a great store of value currently, further a 50 dollar fee on a million dollar transfer to aperson residing in another country is quite good. 
t1_dsuk038	1	*	Sure, Ill do that too. 
t1_dst61o7	1	*	And yet they still rise and fall in unison with it.  
t1_duygno1	0	*	Which worked so well for Trump's campaign in the past, and there's no way people like Jared Kushner or Trump Junior have access to shit they shouldn't have access to.

t1_dv3zq2g	1	*	I gursntee you this idiot hates Clinton specifically because of Russian trolls on Reddit and fake news websites made by Russians. That's just how these the_donald type cultists operate.

t1_dtx21a8	0	*	But that's not the only way a state can be capitalist.
t1_dudhcm2	1	*	I'm pretty sure they can't, just like Japan. I might be wrong but I think that was part of the deal at the end of ww2 just like most of our other wars, a permanent military base lease.

t1_dsstybv	0	*	The whole premise about them being hit hard by illegal immigrants, or their children at least, many of them would be naturalized.  That's not a problem on the ground, only on right wing blogs.

t1_dtobwlr	0	*	You know Im right
t1_dtoeieg	1	*	Ok so even if your right that gives them the right to stay here illegally? To boot if we complain about it somehow were wrong and racist? Did I get you right?
t1_dto9our	1	*	Hahahaha, that's precious. In a way you're right though, the US only feels entitled to invade and install murderous puppet regimes. 
t1_dtow3yl	0	*	It only helps when everything else has failed. That's like saying you're secure from heart disease because you can afford a heart transplant.
t1_dtoadxm	1	*	But the underpopulated swing states have all the power. 
t1_dto9kds	0	*	You're usually the ones who start shit so you'll probably be the ones who make things go to shit. Biggest nuclear arsenal in the world right?
t1_dto9vbq	1	*	Only since the same lefties who complain about it have cut the funding down ridiculously.
t1_dto8v1e	0	*	Put yur phone in a large bowl of lukewarm water for 5 minutes. This will cause your display to reveal the password without pressing Alt+F4.
t1_dtobyc4	1	*	Dont be coming to world news, to an article on military aggression, spouting some bs about how great Canada is, and not expect to get punched in the mouth. Buzz off old timer
t1_dtos567	0	*	At this point I'm almost sure you just mean fully mechanized divisions, not entire army. And if that's the case, that existed for the US, UK, USSR, Germany ... yeah you get my point

t1_dtoc0li	1	*	Its just so Canadian to run from a fight... isnt it?
t1_dto76rt	0	*	Which, of course, they are. Even in Cali the finest primo is grown in hydroponic facilities. None of the highest grade of stuff gets grown outdoors anywhere.
t1_dtocp45	1	*	It's bad when the cutest animals are a kickboxing bodybuilder and a retarded tree bear.  And they'll both destroy you. 
t1_dto9aoz	1	*	I mean, you said education, and Universities falls under that category.

t1_dtpz8xa	1	*	Owns free and clear?   What are his debts and to whom?
t1_dtozjoz	1	*	Well of course :) Out here in BC, if you are younger I expect you use couch and perhaps sofa, if you are older like me, Chesterfield is also in the mix, and I doubt I would ever use settee.
t1_dto9xtx	0	*	He's probably referring to the times the CIA helped overthrow governments, but he might not acknowledge the war with the FARC we helped the Colombians win.

t1_dto8yk9	1	*	Good catch on the spelling mistake.  Thanks!
t1_dtpo1z1	1	*	Sure. And I'm all for that, at least if america was stil a trustworthy ally, which with trump it's clearly not. But that's a different point. 
t1_dto0g0y	0	*	In Florida, can confirm am wanker.  Will piss on graves of those who messed with Canada.
t1_dtobf5r	1	*	LMAO. What a glaringly stupid comment.

t1_du8ddqk	1	*	on ya mate cheers

t1_du88k0v	0	*	Poor Horne.
t1_du8azvm	1	*	Usually you deal drugs or do something else that is illegal for high profit.  Or start cheap and hobo it.  Remember hobo originally mean traveling, working, homeless.  It is rather difficult.
t1_du998zz	1	*	Yikes.
t1_du8bx4s	0	*	The Howard Government ended 2007. Anyone born ~1995 will have been 12 when it ended (and 12 year olds usually don't know much about politics, nor follow it), but will be ~23 today.

t1_du85jxu	0	*	If a person lacks basic literacy they probably won't have the money to buy an iPhone. Think about subsistence farmers in Uganda.
t1_du9ioj8	1	*	The petrol price isn't too bad depending on the car and how often you move around to be honest. If money is tighter one week just stay longer somewhere, if possible.
t1_du8czdz	1	*	Yep, its one of humans not being perfect.

t1_du84d6p	1	*	That will never happen in Australia. 
t1_du88zdt	1	*	Those that vote in said politicians haven't thought it through, or don't care. Which in essence, is democracy.
t1_du85gb6	0	*	Look at the bigger picture. Consider someone a life that's not of your own and their sacrifices.  Selfish prick. 
t1_du916o9	0	*	No, you just make less profit. What about that don't you understand. People suddenly won't buy your crap if it's cheaper? Yea right. 
t1_du8fuaz	0	*	That's a bit of a stretch. Let's keep this business related haha
t1_du8cwsx	0	*	Good I hope we can hire former CEO's as consultants to help government make these purchases. 
t1_du9hfe6	0	*	Haha, I am starting to see a common cause, do you have alot of poor performing staff members? 
t1_du89tnp	0	*	You're trying to argue the point are you not? Or has what you've been trying to say just nonsense?
t1_duawm3c	0	*	Compelling argument. You've convinced me! How could I ever disagree with you? God, you're so smart. 
t1_du8rmiw	1	*	Sadly, no... as you need to be able to dive out of the way if an idiot doesn't understand what 'stop' means.
t1_dtvw1gc	0	*	Lol, oh no, you'll have to take your head out of your ass and use the admin stick
t1_dtvs8k3	0	*	Ideally you take everything in an appropriate context. If youre reasoning for doing something means more than the action itself, were all fucked.   
t1_dtzat0f	1	*	Nope. I just like to see other peoples sources so I can compare. We don't all read the same things, and some of it is pure bullshit from time to time.
t1_dtcs0tt	1	*	He doesnt have to do either of those
t1_duuyy54	0	*	Because you were defending the dudes approach.
t1_dur6o64	1	*	Theres probably hundreds of different scenarios written out by all interested parties. I'd love to one day read them.
t1_duqnjoz	0	*	How so?
t1_duqmp79	1	*	Care to quote me the words I wrote that lead you to that conclusion?  You guy's are being dramatic.  It's gotten old.

t1_dv2vyda	1	*	I mean, I haven't driven all over New Brunswick(just down to Saint John to pick up my then-girlfriend and then on to Halifax), but all I drove on were smooth, double or triple laned divided highways. 
t1_dv2yte2	1	*	>You sure are making a lot of assumptions in that post, all of which are wrong,  try again and better luck next time.  Is this vaguebook?  Have a nice day 
t1_dv2qpsk	1	*	One person, one vote. Ha, it's difficult to believe people this stupid actually exist but here we are.
t1_dv2sq69	0	*	It'll work eventually. This dependence on the US only shows how flawed the current world economy is. It's not going to get fixed by itself you know.
t1_dv2p5w7	0	*	How is acknowledging the mathematical reality that there are fewer of them throwing them under the bus?
t1_dv2xcdc	1	*	You're right.  Nothing more needs to be said.  Huge demographics of people aren't being represented in our representative democracy.
t1_dv37lf3	0	*	Nah, I just see the forest instead of the individual trees.
t1_dv2v6yl	1	*	Usually speed goats, but some deer and moose to keep it interesting.
t1_dv2ns31	0	*	Correlated where? In your mind? Where are the stats? And how did you make the jump from your observation into correlation, into straight up causation. The last two things are not the same
t1_dv2z0b6	1	*	This is a international thing now: all modern roads do that to prevent drivers falling asleep, even on shorter stretches. 
t1_dv2s1nv	1	*	I heard that on long enough straight stretches you can get sort of hypnotized by a road's broken line in an otherwise unchanging landscape and not react if a change does occur. 
t1_dv2vqzc	0	*	You realize I said Canada is 3x as WIDE as the US is LONG right?  Not that Canada is 3x wider than the US?  
t1_dv3cv4s	0	*	So you don't have any examples where it was a net positive then?  I mean a real economic one, not one you made up
t1_dv2w96t	1	*	Which is really frustrating. I really hate that we (people, in general) can be so easily swayed, even when the facts are laid out in front of us.
t1_dvqx1eb	0	*	Bro... Who hurt you? 
t1_dv2r6kr	0	*	Macka.
t1_dv2pm0o	0	*	> Because it ensures the government is held accountable to populations from every region of the US  except it doesn't. like you said, it shifts power to the swing states

t1_dv2rcdg	1	*	;)
t1_dv2s1ch	0	*	That was putting Bush's wars on the books and TARP which Bush started before he left. Deficits under Obama lowered every year.
t1_dv2s9qb	0	*	Congress is responsible for passing budgets. Guess who controlled Congress while Obama was President? He signed Republican budgets. Go back to skewl and you can be kewl.
t1_dv2q265	0	*	thats something we have in common, the great plains are cool when you get there but they *never.fucking.end* its just grass, corn, wheat, repeat. like, its crazy

t1_dv2szqv	0	*	 looks like Michigan, and i feel like a sick fuck for making that joke now. 
t1_dv2xof8	0	*	Stolen Supreme Court seat.  Rules actually exist an they were followed. But its theft now. Crazy people just want anarchy so they can get what they want.
t1_dv3115f	0	*	Thoughts and prayers has basically become a meme at this point. It is the right's response to everything.
t1_dv2tauw	0	*	The very role of president implies a representative democracy. In a 'true' democracy all people would have to vote on every single issue.
t1_dv2xjfd	0	*	https://www.factcheck.org/2016/08/trumps-false-obama-isis-link/  I mean, you're wrong. Instead of swallowing T_Ds load, you should actually branch out and look at other news sources.

t1_dv2sp84	1	*	Vets work for me. ETA 2:30 hrs, I don't like doing transactions over mobile.
t1_dv2qon9	1	*	Youre wrong.  Many people agree with him.  Only conservatives like the EC because it helps them.
t1_dv2q2p8	1	*	And if your dog runs away you just need to stand on the roof of your house to spot him, even if it has been a week.
t1_dv2q2bh	0	*	Eh, TIL.

t1_dv2qtv2	1	*	Hes right.
t1_dv2nvq5	1	*	the fact that this is publicly know is a sign that the bribery was badly executed. but then he is trump and nothing matters.
t1_dv2w6oq	1	*	Poutine, not poontang
t1_dv2kbom	0	*	Youre right. He did travel all over the world apologizing, he made great speeches and issued thousands of executive orders to curtail democracy.   Yeah youre right. He did do something. 
t1_dv2pumm	0	*	I think 12% of people voted for trump, and less than 80% voted Hillary. A large portion didn't vote for either after Bernie was out
t1_dv2qsax	0	*	They literally said in a generation.
t1_dv39p3l	1	*	I honestly wouldnt count myself in on not acting the same way as the Kim regime when I was raised to believe everything they were raised to believe. Could you say you wouldnt?

t1_due8wm0	0	*	After a ninja edit. It used to say 260k
t1_dudq72g	0	*	Uh ... no they aren't. The british built up Australia and the US. It's not a comparision, that's literally what happened.
t1_dudswld	1	*	Genocided? Wow haha first time i have ever heard that, you musy be a special person lol... Yeah the spanish were brutal, shitty deal for the Mayans i suppose.  
t1_dudrl5u	0	*	Interesting. Would you say it acted more as a detriment to those brought to America (current US citizens) or those people who were left in Africa ? 
t1_duh5mu5	0	*	Not sure who you are replying to champ, but perhaps lay of the alcohol before you get on the internet. Its ok to admit you are wrong sometimes ;)

t1_dtuicvp	0	*	Because originally it was decided by a dick measuring contest.
t1_dtulknd	0	*	Wouldn't you prefer to be hung rather than hanged?
t1_dtui75k	1	*	Because a hanged jury would imply they were executed, a hung jury implys they are stuck. 
t1_dtvf1ak	0	*	I actually downvoted before it clicked :P
t1_dtuiga5	0	*	Don't forget many deathrow inmates can sit there for decades also costing additional fees on top of already expensive execution 
t1_dtumbum	0	*	If that's really the only point of my post you can attack then I'm pretty proud of what I've written.
t1_dtukck3	0	*	This is why I think the death penalty should be a bullet in the back of the head.  It's cheaper, and arguably more humane if they don't know it's coming since it's instantaneous
t1_dturp4q	0	*	But you wouldn't know that before looking it up.
t1_dtuu5py	0	*	I'd suggest female friend to make it clearer.
t1_dtvde6s	0	*	My point was not that drugs are harmless but that all of that *will happen anyway.*  Criminalizing it hasn't changed a damn thing. So what's the point of it?
t1_dtuacsh	1	*	Fair enough but chemically speaking, hot smoke from tobacco is more harmful than hot smoke from marijuana because of the nicotine. Notice I didn't say it was harmless, just less harmful.
t1_dtur2nm	0	*	It was wordplay. Weed is another name for cannabis. I found it humorous. I was hoping you might find humor in it as well.
t1_dtv6aci	1	*	big dock jufy
t1_dtumbj5	1	*	Which is why you have to talk to the other jurors about it.
t1_dsjn9s2	0	*	For me?  Makes no difference.   I am in the Tech Industry.  How's that inner seathing hatred treating you?

t1_duw341c	0	*	well, taking an honest assessment of the situation vis a vis which countries are contributing to the problem to which degree would be a decent  start
t1_duvxdw7	0	*	You should write more when you're baked, it reads well! /r/WritingPrompts might be worth stopping by!  Check out our good buddy the semicolon though.   http://theoatmeal.com/comics/semicolon
t1_duw08tv	1	*	Wait, is that an option?  Asking for a friend...

t1_dt3whpw	0	*	Who are the researchers?  What are their backgrounds?  I asked the first questions.  
t1_dt2kdj7	1	*	So is that why Hitler got rid of so many people? Every drawing he screwed up he's just get rid of the subject?
t1_dt2le9x	1	*	cool man 
t1_dt2liko	1	*	I figured! S'all good.
t1_dt2tp2o	0	*	So the rest of the universe was already there? Just not the Sun?  I'm just trying to picture the proposed situation, here. 
t1_dt2ldyi	1	*	Yep, absolutely. 
t1_dt2mabl	1	*	Im not so sure about that.
t1_dt777yy	1	*	I am not. Just because the catholic church is technically descended from the apostolic church, does not mean they represent them accurately today.
t1_dt4llrh	0	*	in what world are faith and feeling synonymous? 
t1_dt2kq1p	1	*	damn, had no idea he was behind the dawn of modern art
t1_dt2qb4y	0	*	I dunno man, you sound pretty enlightened.
t1_dt2n32z	0	*	Yes the already sick and already bankrupt people would be miserable in any other country

t1_dt6i27x	1	*	http://infographic.statista.com/normal/chartoftheday_8974_us_unemployment_rate_n.jpg  What does this chart look like to you?
t1_dt2r3m7	1	*	Hippo!  It's a hippo!  Gather up the rocks to stone this infidel.
t1_dt2ntl6	1	*	Because God literally told the Jewish people that the Bible was true but not fact. That is God's view of the Bible. 
t1_dt2qbhv	1	*	Turtles. But the turtles are also a simulation.
t1_dt2o8c2	1	*	You know what, I'm gonna say no but I'm not sure.
t1_dt2kx2m	1	*	Have you heard the tragedy of Darth Bob Ross? It's not something an Art Teacher will tell you.
t1_dt3f3mg	0	*	They came here illegally, enough said. Illegal aliens are currently costing us 116 billion dollars a year. That's absurd. 
t1_dt2qqzu	0	*	 What gives the group or regulations authority to determine such things? 
t1_dt3g8th	1	*	I'm just telling you what the evidence clearly indicates. In no way did I call you stupid.
t1_dt2t7h4	0	*	What aspects of it would you say you believe in. It's clearly not the historical aspect, and it doesn't make sense to me to *believe* in an allegory. 
t1_dt4ae8k	1	*	How many times have you had a pop up or just been walking around and some idiot is like want to take a survey? How many times did you say yes?
t1_dt37sge	1	*	Did God make man *before* or *after* he made plants and trees?
t1_dt3ldj3	1	*	In the first one animals were created first and then humans, in the second humans first then animals.
t1_dt2t1cv	1	*	What? What are you talking about?
t1_dt303fv	1	*	Exactly. There is the Apocrypha, which includes many other biblical writings that the Romans decided to cut from the official version, and the Jewish Midrash.  
t1_dt2ohxg	0	*	Ok, where did God come from? And why did he create a bunch of clever monkeys only to damn them to eternal hell unless they were really nice to him? Why would you even want that to be real lol
t1_dt2qr11	0	*	> linear   pretty huge assumption
t1_dt362kl	0	*	Lol its not that big of a deal, I just said it was annoying? Like a lone fly in your room or stubbing your toe. 
t1_dt2kl42	1	*	I may have a solution
t1_dt2o5qt	1	*	Sweet, and away I goooo!!!
t1_dt2ovvc	0	*	Do I really have to post a link explaining what a SCIENTIFIC THEORY is?  Tip: It's a hypothesis with overwhelming **evidence** in favour and none against.
t1_dt2mhvm	1	*	Oh, okay.  Well, anyways, I think that Holocaust jokes can sometimes be funny, but this one was particularly vicious and obscene. Also, it was completely uncalled for. 
t1_dtay1zs	1	*	Anytime :)
t1_dsdeveu	0	*	I can see there would be some false positives, but I'd be willing to bet there's a lot of legit porn in the mix...
t1_dsh29b8	0	*	I really doubted it lol
t1_dsdodx9	0	*	That's the thing though. Most likely close to every device, that is allowed to be used for personal matters attempted to view online pornography. 
t1_dsn00ui	1	*	As I said in my earlier post maybe its because of my age, but you basically asked me to provide proof the Iran is a country or water is in fact wet.  
t1_dsmyqcf	1	*	Np. I agree that its a biased source, but used it since its pretty well sourced itself and includes video of the UN election. I dont know why he wouldnt just link it though lol. Makes no sense. 
t1_dsdcmgb	0	*	Well now you are just being dumb
t1_duvq5xb	1	*	That's not what we're talking about. 
t1_duv1ins	1	*	No, they did that by being disingenuous in the interest of feeling important. Thus every single reply in this chain being obfuscative.  I'll admit I could have put it more diplomatically.
t1_dsbo9hu	0	*	A lack of belief is not belief. 
t1_dsbayi3	1	*	You are so fucking weak man, reading your childish responses to his arguments is killing me inside. 
t1_dsc4i6u	0	*	And none of that had absolutely anything to do with atheism.
t1_dsbdhhc	1	*	> You need therapy.  Not the guy you insulted.  You seem to be a *very special human being*.
t1_dsbe02k	0	*	No. Was it rape? 
t1_dsbq2gr	0	*	Enough with the tactical definitions. Atheists and socialists are always shifting definitions to win an argument, bunch of shifty bullshitters. Nobody cares.
t1_dsbdgos	1	*	Fully accepting that I may regret this, but what mental illness?
t1_dsba6uq	0	*	Good, good, dodge the argument.
t1_dse5etp	1	*	They want it to be more inclusive. How does that support your nonsense?
t1_dtrekmt	0	*	It's easy in your eyes because you were approved. Of course we will eventually grant PR status to spouses (as my husband will get eventually).  
t1_dtrbjo3	1	*	Well I have no comments 
t1_dtqfwi9	1	*	You are the one not separating immigrants from refugees.  one is a process based on merit the other is based on circumstances. 
t1_dtqz72s	0	*	It makes no difference size, all I want is to have Canadas merit based immigration policies. Why is that wrong?
t1_dtsd4uj	1	*	Yeah you have to play to the market. 
t1_dtqlbh5	0	*	Sorry, posting in r/The_Donald regularly is indicative that your case is terminal.
t1_dtquzxh	0	*	i dont get what youre asking? clearly we need these people and we issue them visas. but you can issue nonimmigrant visas. not everyone who comes here should be eligible to become a citizen.
t1_dtqx4ta	0	*	Im neither broke nor bitter, I even pay for my own post secondary.....but I've never paid for high school. you're just making massive generalizations and very little sense.  
t1_dtrfq4r	1	*	Dayum man! I guess with our dumpster fire of a president sure
t1_dt975rr	0	*	I get where you're coming from, but obviously one is more severe than the other; also morality changes from culture to culture so it's unfair to compare Africa to the US for example.
t1_dtb6gkk	1	*	Because work is slow and I have to waste time somehow?  And I mean, second verse same as the first with you people.  Like I said, gotta keep you retards reigned in somehow.
t1_dt8wzdv	0	*	Are you okay? You're taking this kind of personal
t1_du9wt45	0	*	I think you're the one doing mental gymnastics. That, or you don't know what democracy is.
t1_dvd6i3p	1	*	I was being facetiously facetious. 
t1_dtfdog0	1	*	Good luck with your cult, buddy.
t1_dsf72qp	0	*	Wow, what a great lesson.  Meanwhile, 1 party elected someone who claimed the previous President was born in Kenya.   But yeah, both parties are so fucked.
t1_dsfbuct	0	*	You do realize hes just a red herring brought up by the right to try to explain why people protest on the left right?  Protesters arent paid, they really hate Trump that much.
t1_duftv6h	0	*	They're sniping and placing IEDs for years, that's nothing Israel can't handle, and the rocket threat reduced to zero for the time being.
t1_duiz24w	1	*	Why would they stop settlement expansion? What do they have to gain? Either way there would be no peace, you can't tell a city to just stop growing either.
t1_du24ef3	0	*	with you, it's like corporations don't even exist.
t1_dtocic3	0	*	Yes, and carbon dioxide, methane, and temperature were at one point higher than they are now. High readings is not definitive proof that humams are causing climate change.
t1_dv4pvs6	0	*	Well yeah thats how apartheid works. Jews dont need them
t1_dv4ngy0	0	*	Well if youre gonna headbutt a wall you'd be harmed. Are walls harmful?
t1_dv76kyf	0	*	> forcing Israel to take control  You should tell the PA to stop making deals with Israel. What a great idea, they should just go to war again. 
t1_dv4wlyp	0	*	When Hamas decides to stop hiding among civilians and actually put on a uniform, I'll support that position a lot more.
t1_dv4q3uy	0	*	By that logic a toy gun is a gun. 
t1_dv5izp8	0	*	bet you have 100 confirmed kills, were the CEO of a large corp by 18 and bedded 1000 women already, did i miss anything? 
t1_dv4vdkj	0	*	That people running away does not mean the riot is over.
t1_dv50l1y	0	*	what about not taking peoples land? 
t1_dv4g79f	0	*	See- the Volksturm. A 14 year old who had a rifle forced into their hands isn't capable of being a war criminal IMO
t1_dstvei2	1	*	Annnnnnnnd there goes their account. 
t1_dsu8o4e	0	*	I had to go attend lecture. Thank you for the defense.
t1_dufw09c	1	*	What's our clearance, Clarence?
t1_dufv1jj	1	*	Turbo props are completely different to normal props.
t1_dugbk68	0	*	Thanks man, it just happens sometimes. I appreciate your explanations! While I am interested in aircraft, I definitely don't know everything, not even close.
t1_dugg7hx	0	*	Tell me about it. And then there are the middle aged male hobbyist photographers who just *have* to stop and talk about your gear when you're just out anywhere in the world holding a camera. 
t1_dufx02z	1	*	Not a lot means he still sees a few. A few that weren't texting. So it's easy to generalize that to mean none of them texting
t1_dug3ksm	0	*	If you start by saying to sum it up, it's somewhat expected.
t1_dug1esw	1	*	Yes. Two hypothetical deaths, not meant to be interpreted as the only outcome of each situation. 
t1_dufw81a	0	*	What a time to be alive
t1_dufxv2t	1	*	bUt pOrp pLaInEs R uNsAfE
t1_dugm19m	1	*	Same to you! Its a bitch to balance. Good luck!
t1_dufwcdy	0	*	Dude idc
t1_dufyu6o	1	*	But that would be disingenuous. And also wrong. It's white women. 
t1_dugasrj	0	*	Fair enough and good point. I did make an assumption.
t1_dufxwkh	1	*	I may start doing it 
t1_dufpmnl	1	*	o.. ok...
t1_dugg4fk	1	*	Most likely pilot error. The pilots miss judged where they were causing a Controlled Flight into Terrain.
t1_dugbqnd	1	*	In the context of you would think teenagers would cause more problems on the road.
t1_du5crhi	0	*	Japan has never been a tributary. Japan has always been an equal or greater power than China.
t1_du5i23m	1	*	In the Bundestag, yes (fortunately). But if you are generally talking about the most popular parties, the NPD would be the one on the far right end of the spectrum.
t1_du54zyd	0	*	No Antifa would very much love a conservative genocide.
t1_du57dwe	0	*	> it is a different picture for the UK, and countries like France and Sweden also see rising antisemitism, mainly because of arab immigration  Got any evidence for that?
t1_du596xf	1	*	Molson is our piss beer, yes!
t1_du6hgf3	1	*	I'm comparing acts which are similar to many grotesque leaders.  You continue to push the Hitler narrative.  We were in fact done when you posted your first ignorant response.
t1_du5cj0s	0	*	Of course the big websites are. FYI There are other sites on the internet. Those have no footprint on EU soil. Though that gap is closing with AWS, which does have locations globally.
t1_du5q5j8	0	*	> who are angry the European immigrants are taking their jobs when the jobs are just shit ones being infiltrated by automation  Well, as long as you're mutual in your lack of concern for one another.
t1_du5er2c	1	*	You're right, Moon did, under a long held party pledge if they won the election, and they did. 
t1_du585nd	1	*	The best way to drink a Natty Ice is to do several shots of your favorite liquor and wait 15 minutes before your first beer.
t1_du5lgsc	1	*	Fully.
t1_du5mdqg	1	*	Username double-checks out?
t1_du5bqex	1	*	I actually love craft beer and frequently buy from microbreweries here in Canada. Very rarely do I buy brand name beer.
t1_du5kyuv	1	*	Taste friends
t1_du5hqhu	0	*	Do you really want your government to be *that* involved in the process?  If so, why?
t1_dugo8sy	0	*	If a company is not in the EU, how would they be fined anyway?
t1_du5b2u4	1	*	For a given value of delicious. Something along the lines of leaves you with a RESISTABLE desire to vomit.
t1_du55qoa	1	*	The US information is interesting, there were half as many assaults, but twice as many harassments. I'd rather it be that way than to opposite, but really I'd like that number to be 0.
t1_du5d685	0	*	Take the L and shut up, you're really wrong
t1_du6se02	0	*	Unless you are one of the bodyguards.
t1_du5lq8r	0	*	Especially Bavarians
t1_du4zhrg	0	*	You know my brother? i put the name here myself because all the information is listed on that website. i didn't disclose anything that hasn't already been on the internet for years.
t1_du4ymp7	0	*	that's the scummy corporate practice? using your ip address to serve you an ad for a product that you might purchase? you might want to look up the definition of scummy if you think that's bad.
t1_du604i4	1	*	This made me laugh far more than it should have. 
t1_du5f6t8	0	*	Tax and spend liberal progressives vs mortgage and spend fiscal conservatives.   The same was done during the Reagan and Bush eras. Will enough people see it this time around?
t1_du5hwp9	1	*	I concur. 
t1_du5c5gf	0	*	Relatively speaking sure, but you cannot deny America isn't going forward but rather going backwards while North Korea is staying stagnant with the tiniest whiff of leaning forward ever so slightly. 
t1_du506j0	1	*	He didn't implement it until 2015, not 2008. 
t1_du698s7	0	*	It's data related to European residents, not citizens. Similar effect but slightly different. 
t1_du5aumn	1	*	Yes if you come to my house to get it lol
t1_du5dbd0	0	*	There were good people on both sides with the other side being made up of white supremacists.
t1_du5tehc	1	*	They can ask money from users or deal with advertisements in a better way.
t1_du57n3p	1	*	no one in Israel gives a fuck about UN coz they are hypocrites. 
t1_du5peub	0	*	Except that it's incredibly easy to argue that the tracking is necessary for their service.  Every website needs to run analytics and track users.
t1_du6d7kt	1	*	Wrong. If you do business in China as an American, you will go to jail if you do things like the Germans. In fact, the FBI will greet you with handcuffs as you get off the plane. 
t1_du5e3y6	0	*	Then why is it mostly Republicans who are racist and include antisemetism in that category?
t1_du5c02z	1	*	Yeah I was not including larger Oregon Breweries or New York. I was thinking about beers in my City that I might be able to find ~150 miles away on the other side of my state 
t1_du646m2	1	*	Fair in many cases, but Im a big believer in small government.  Open to more public private partnerships though
t1_du6k746	1	*	Geez dude, you are as obtuse as a flat line.
t1_du6oq8k	1	*	hence the comparison is meaningless since its true for almost every american politician
t1_du58ygf	0	*	So its all centralized? Like for the whole of the eu or on a country by country basis?
t1_du5b1c6	1	*	There are people here actually defending North Korea, and are blaming the US for the suffering occurring there.  Fuck this sub and fuck CNN for their North Korean apologia.
t1_du5hwik	1	*	> People should be free to kill others, regardless if the other one dies.  > Arresting someone for killing people is authoritarian.  Makes literally the same amount of sense.
t1_du6lehm	0	*	Honey when I say WhatsApp has died on college campuses in America and people respond with thats not true Im in Europe and its very popular how exactly is that relevant to the discussion.
t1_du5ifsd	1	*	Don't worry, we're still getting GDPR and ePR passed into UK law, the real decider will be how the Information Commissioners Office enforces it.
t1_du5z5t4	1	*	They tickle my American nose and smell like shit.
t1_du5hepd	0	*	oh i don't really care. but you do know that there's a difference between sharing browser history and explaining what data is public and what's not, right? maybe you don't know. that's ok, too.
t1_dt17tmo	0	*	Im glad youre now qualified to speak for all Muslim scholars.
t1_dt1tfl5	1	*	... dead pedophile...  ftfy
t1_dt0h6dl	0	*	You're dodging the important questions.  Why public? What is the intent behind a relatively light physical punishment but performed publicly?
t1_dt0y25r	0	*	So if you go back in time and convince Obama's mother to have an abortion, it's not murder?
t1_dtbulf3	1	*	It's always good to Discover new possibilities. 
t1_dtbpid4	0	*	I'm stuck in a small airport with poor internet service. Meanwhile you've responded to everything? 
t1_dtfov0i	1	*	As was I...
t1_dtcqv9g	0	*	Nah, I'm sure you're stupid because there isn't a third option on this situation. 
t1_dtc31cg	0	*	Someone feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but doesn't the US have some of the worst economic  mobility of the developed nations?
t1_dtc0v0d	1	*	That still doesn't work. Hardly anybody is stuck poor. Almost anyone can work hard to get out of that situation.
t1_dtc6p09	1	*	and people wonder why libertarians are generally thought of as nasty...  
t1_dtbxk8s	0	*	Those words do not appear anywhere in the article I linked
t1_dtbs6t4	0	*	t_d has really gone off the deep end
t1_dtcfwat	0	*	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_with_universal_health_care  It would be a shorter list if you asked which countries didn't have universal of free healthcare. 
t1_dtbrsjg	1	*	Thank you. I was under the impression state was a well understood term.
t1_dtbq7vb	0	*	I'm Canadian  Then why are you trashing Trump? Its like you just want to fit in on reddit or something. Hmm 
t1_dtbwlqm	0	*	Im from Alabama and Im not simplifying anything at all. If you choose to be blind to it thats your choice, doesnt mean thats not how it is. 
t1_dtbm344	0	*	Hence proving my point that points aren't even considered but labels hurled arbitrarily.
t1_dtbthqj	0	*	Lol nah. I'm not engaging you because I know you're just looking for a political debate to occupy yourself.    Sorry.
t1_dtbqjms	1	*	This is a hate Trump thread folks   .. stop that proper grammar bs
t1_dtbov5h	0	*	Proving my point again.    Youre too easy 
t1_dtcb8et	0	*	Actions speak louder than thoughts. 
t1_dsvqkx0	0	*	So long as everyone is poor, then nothing matters. That's the socialist philosophy, huh?
t1_dsjaqbv	1	*	OK fair point.
t1_dsjjee1	0	*	I don't need any sarcasm. You're trying to fight back a minor insult of mine to regain a sense of pride and dignity. That is how small your world is.
t1_dsc6de5	0	*	Are you just bound and determined to make excuses for cowardice?  
t1_dso7z06	0	*	Gotta wait for John Oliver to tell you what your opinion on the topic should be?
t1_dso1lfj	1	*	Sounds like obama care is failing them iyam..  And what about his response to the hurricane are we talking about here
t1_dsn718i	0	*	why cant you argue without resorting to names? is it that hard to act like a grownup when someone has different views than you?
t1_dsot8rg	0	*	Why is keeping more of the money I earn a problem?
t1_dso21on	0	*	Sorry to hear you not doing so well..  Have thought of returning to school to gain another skill??
t1_dso9d2x	0	*	It matters to me. At the very least it means that a majority of Americans didn't want that shitnipple in office, and that's a reassuring thought. 
t1_dspd9yf	0	*	I don't agree with what you are saying about the Iraq war. The Budget exploded while he was in office due to the war.
t1_dso1w3g	0	*	I've never heard of the Party of European Socialdemocrats. Nor have I heard of the Labor and Socialdemocrat International.  
t1_dsnp1q0	0	*	Google the dow jones index and look at the last few years, and the rate of change.  I don't know how to link to a graph view but easily found.
t1_dso16w7	0	*	Just because you can find a politicized news article doesn't mean it's true and that you're not a puppet, dude.
t1_dsnoxoh	1	*	> If the slope of the increase/decrease doesn't change, then no Trump cannot be credited with economy strength.  Now that you know the slope did in fact change you should be honest and admit it.
t1_dsngdru	0	*	You got me good with that one. gj
t1_dsnghg4	1	*	Its almost as if we are talking about more fascists or something....
t1_dsnwh27	0	*	3 million 
t1_dsnvy38	1	*	You're arguing with a troll. You have an obligation to the truth. These people do not. 
t1_dtnihz2	1	*	Heh, that was me mostly being tongue in cheek, not that every money grubbing fuck on the corporate ladder wasn't doing their damndest to pay tax whatsoever before Trump fucked it, *sigh*.
t1_dsoeh2o	1	*	Not really, why dont you tell me about it..
t1_dso4qrn	0	*	but alas, they do not.  
t1_dsor1ba	0	*	You are just circle jerking. Stop being willfully ignorant. 
t1_dsnap1f	0	*	Again, sorry I dont share your opinion and that leads you to resorting to insults to convey your disapproval..    
t1_dsnuro5	1	*	I should've been clearer, I'm pro NN for areas that have monopolies, duopolies etc.. But for areas where there is adequate choice NN is not needed.
t1_dso3n0e	0	*	Huh...  All the growth recently must have covered up the wrecked economy.
t1_dsllrnp	1	*	Bwhahaha you're hilarious,  sorry to have wasted time with you.  
t1_durs0ng	0	*	I work out of town and eat out every single day, so when I'm home I make my wife cook! Lol
t1_du1c5kf	0	*	Is this really the argument you want to make? I haven't had the urge to grope anyone if that's what you're interested in.
t1_du1hdeh	0	*	Yeah and our hope and change president really hoped he could change that... and then didn't.
t1_du1yog9	1	*	Hate to be the one to break this to you, but a good chunk of the US was British at one point too.  Bellend.
t1_du5zz2z	0	*	You wrote several paragraphs out of frustration. It's all good, bro. Just laughs. Don't get emotional. 
t1_du1rdd7	1	*	... so transparent...
t1_dsr55in	1	*	You no doubt have gained an appreciation, through your schooling, for the fragility of the engineered world that surrounds us. Thanks for sharing.
t1_dsq943a	0	*	I mean, children can design buildings too. Civil's can't stamp drawings for buildings. 
t1_dspo03d	1	*	DONNA NOBLE HAS BEEN SAVED

t1_dspn5no	0	*	The UAE has the 7th highest GDP per capita in the world. Their cities contain many technological marvels. Judging a country based solely on your own social standards is simply ridiculous.
t1_dsq96jq	0	*	I don't think I know of any firm that would accept a civil to stamp structural drawings, though I do think its allowed. 
t1_dspt0ez	1	*	I understand that but they shouldnt say that the myth is busted and it cant be done. Just that they couldnt confirm that its possible. 
t1_dtdg0b0	0	*	>erode the theocratic power that Israel currently holds.  world peace  
t1_dt8oz3x	1	*	I don't believe that those people care about thier base.

t1_dt90gp9	0	*	...and its been 70 years.  How many are still alive?
t1_dt9ndis	0	*	Huh ? I mean he actually more or less implemented the vote of the senate decades before him. And the US army is pretty much the only relevant one here. 
t1_dt8nljq	1	*	My argument is that they currently have food but later they won't. Is this not clear. Because to my understanding this obeisty comes from lack of work not a surplus food.
t1_dtatod3	1	*	Excuse me I forgot it's Israel's world and we're all just living in it. 
t1_dtavf1s	1	*	Bro, this guy advocates the extermination of all Israeli citizens. There's no reasoning with him.   I'm honestly surprised that he's not banned for all the clearly extremely racist things he says.
t1_dt9tnah	0	*	Shall we chalk this one up to bad parenting?

t1_dt9s7y9	1	*	Israel was not actually blockaded by Egypt though, they said they were but that was a lie. 
t1_dtryy3r	1	*	> As is always the case with 9/11 truthers, you rely on if you think you need to be a scientist to realise this is fake line of thinking.  I guess I'm done as well then, peace!
t1_dt2ocze	0	*	It certainly matters if a campaign coordinated with them to release said info.
t1_dt3cz17	1	*	So some of it is lies? Seems legit...

t1_dt2s62b	1	*	Yes. I don't count baby panda born at zoo to be comparable to any alleged scandal.
t1_dt2qzrx	0	*	Vetting does not mean taking a source in blind faith. Anyone who didn't go along with the govt's claims was outcast.
t1_duloprl	0	*	Difference is Doctors are private and Law Enforcement Officers are government. 
t1_dulwmaw	0	*	All the more reason not to fire them for shooting someone unless its proven to be unlawful. 
t1_dum3oj7	1	*	No shit that's why there is paid and unpaid leave, depending on if they are at fault or not.
t1_dsaqcid	0	*	Same with blacks who should know better than to move into a white neighborhood, right?
t1_dsb4yo3	1	*	In reality disassembling that system would necessarily mean disassembling states given the role states play in perpetuating and protecting that system.
t1_dsan1p5	0	*	Because they had much of a choice... It was basically Britain going this is the best you'll get, take it or leave it.
t1_dsak3cv	1	*	So the real solution lies in immigration control, I agree.
t1_dsadgc2	0	*	You're still anti-them. I'm definitely anti-ISIS.
t1_dsb3pfs	1	*	saying their people dont have the same inalienable right that other peoples gave is self hatred and discriminatory
t1_dsb1j5b	0	*	But a confederate statue means they want slavery, right?
t1_dsafiuo	0	*	How are they advocating to reshape Israel?
t1_dsa5nyd	1	*	I realize my last comment sounds really dickish if you dont know the specifics of American government. I just kind of assumed you were American, which was probably dumb based of the thread
t1_ds9zwms	1	*	What? Do citizens get to sleep in each others beds?
t1_dsabmto	0	*	> No zionist is going to redefine the Jewish in Jewish state to also include the Palestinians.    And yet there are two million Arab Israeli citizens. How many Jews live in Palestine again? 
t1_dsajx1t	0	*	So I can make a video (shared with millions) saying Someone should actually kill black people but as long as I say it to my pug its ok?
t1_dsboqwl	0	*	And being born on one?
t1_ds3477c	1	*	If that's what you mean by faith, then faith is actually a very strong backing. It's like having faith that the sun will rise tomorrow.

t1_dtn5cxz	0	*	> You don't have to like it  I don't (because it's stupid) and that's pretty much the entirety of my point.
t1_dtnx9b8	1	*	It doesn't involve God's penis, that's for sure. 
t1_dtntywo	0	*	>Like arresting someone for not wearing the correct clothing constitutes some sort of government backed systematic oppression of peoples freedoms?  Yes, it does
t1_dtpd0ck	1	*	And just because you can wear something doesn't mean it's purpose is clothing.  A yamaka is clothing but it's purpose is not to function as a hat.  
t1_dtnai4h	0	*	Yep!

t1_dtn8qrm	0	*	> Anyway. It's getting late over here.  Knew it.
t1_dtnb2ne	1	*	And yet that is the majority. In both cases.  And in both cases they must be seen as what they do, not what they *should be*. Both are corrupt. Neither are safe to turn one's back on.
t1_dtmxkbm	1	*	It's a Reddit thread not a grand oratory
t1_dtnni2e	0	*	Once again,  I don't have my textbook and can't give the name because I'm not at home right now and it has a very generic name. If you want to wait about a week I can get it.. unless I sold it.

t1_dt41opr	1	*	Your comprehension is fucked up.  The sarcasm was in relation to the UK terror problem, earlier comments suggested there was no problem, sarcasm was in response.
t1_ds1zqpo	0	*	> no beheadings in the parking lots  lol you're just trolling now. Turkey is cheap, get over it :)
t1_ds9fh0b	1	*	I think I explained it well enough above. Perhaps you can take it up with Sweden's Discrimination Ombudsman and its ruling.

t1_dsog8m4	1	*	And yet that has nothing to do with being bullied out of the Canal? the UK and France could invade Egypt tomorrow, but yet you'd still try and make the same argument
t1_dspl8rt	0	*	Well then who does? Regular people are the ones electing a government that funds the military.   Don't blame the American obsession with the military on your allies.
t1_dsogl7p	0	*	We gave it back prior to the expension of the deal by around 40 years. After having US servicemen die in riots and sniping, that's literally what happened.
t1_dsok3wt	1	*	oh absolutely
t1_dunvuu9	0	*	Yes. Because under the constraints I listed you don't need a trial to determine that the ownership of the gun has changed and not through legal means. 
t1_dup58mm	0	*	wikipedia is not a sufficient source for college, thus not for me either...
t1_duojljk	0	*	You've never been to a gun show have you?
t1_duns6k9	1	*	What assault rifle are you talking about?  An AR15 is not an assault rifle by any definition other than it is black and looks scary, but when you use that definition almost every gun becomes one.
t1_duoq9zm	1	*	But literally the only people who will obay any new law or regulation are the people already obaying every law oilr regulation.
t1_duoyhkm	1	*	This is pretty much one of the laws in Japan in regards to ownership of a firearm.
t1_dupeo9j	1	*	I was there with him. I saw it happen. :/ I mean, it's fine to dismiss isolated anecdotes, but don't pretend what you're scoffing at never exists. That's just being ignorant.

t1_dunz002	0	*	Sorry maybe they dont want guns in general in schools. But thats just bad parenting right. 
t1_dupfrf1	0	*	You think that defending yourself should be a privilege granted (or not) by the state?  Isn't that kind of, you know, a fundamental sort of thing?
t1_dunvujv	1	*	What makes a gun an assault rifle?
t1_duovuyz	0	*	It's literally a semi-automatic version of the *M16*.  *Why do people need M16s for hunting?*
t1_duof9la	1	*	And considering there are almost 9 guns per 10 people in the US, outright banning them is not going to stop people from finding them.
t1_duobo7p	0	*	So you're good with groups that are traditionally targeted by governments being unable to put up a good defense because of the .01% chance you'll get shot in a mass shooting?
t1_duohmp3	0	*	And even then it wouldnt do much to stop violence.   Violence is an inherit human trait, and we can prentent its not all we want and blame inanimate objects for violence, but it wont help.
t1_dute2ps	1	*	Lol. You tell yourself whatever you want to make yourself feel safer, man. Confirm your own biases all you want. I know what I saw. I don't need you to confirm it for me.
t1_duo1efo	1	*	Can you explain to me how you define an assault rifle, and how does it differ functionally from a...regular rifle, I guess you could say?
t1_duo9lp1	1	*	Becaue indirect effects exist?
t1_duo5voz	0	*	In Wisconsin at least, if there's a domestic disturbance call, someone's getting booked and spending the night in jail. More states should have this policy.
t1_dup8uxq	0	*	With that logic in mind, why the fuck do we even care about terrorism?
t1_dupup87	0	*	Okay. In what way is   > because they are easy to get  Different from any other semi automatic rifle?
t1_duourm2	1	*	So they wait 3 years and then shoot up the school?  Or use a handgun and kill 32 people like the guy from Virginia tech did? Were going to be so much safer!  /s
t1_duphv3r	0	*	Americans seems to think so.
t1_dup1upw	1	*	I have a license to carry a gun.  It wasnt a simple process.  
t1_duoq0re	1	*	You could enforce a gps tracker on guns but that would definitely not go over well.
t1_dunw5p8	0	*	Or you could just give that person the money and save a life.
t1_duo84eq	0	*	It should be out there in media reports; it is for many, if not most.
t1_duofj1l	0	*	I would say living in a place where your family is in such danger that you require a gun is irresponsible. 
t1_duoop8r	1	*	Oh, OK.  I was not getting your point.
t1_duof4d7	0	*	The NICS is just a background check system.  It's not information on every gun sale.
t1_dupi0ai	0	*	Ugh. Clearly not what I was referring to. Doctor assisted suicide is much different than putting a gun in your mouth because you are suffering from depression. 
t1_duoerqh	0	*	So are you saying that law doesnt apply or its not being enforced?
t1_duovyq0	1	*	I guess, I just don't see what his has to do with much of anything. 
t1_duo7rj0	0	*	militia act says white able bodied men.  sounds like you agree that until 2008 was all about militia service & did not apply as a universal individual right... 
t1_duoz98m	0	*	Retaliation = killing innocents that might be associated with a rival gang, or who just live in their neighborhood.
t1_duokj4d	1	*	I agree.  Seems like people don't get that though.
t1_duo1b5y	1	*	The point in the video showed Obama talking about gunshows in IL, only for the host to travel around to gunshows in IL and prove the loophole wrong. Yeah, it surely varies by state laws.
t1_dtig87x	1	*	Correct. Hence the numerous arguments  regarding the prison and my use of the word should. 
t1_dtixj5a	1	*	He _had_ been using his own plane - doing a quick google search reveals that the secret service doesn't want him doing that anymore.

t1_dtitptk	0	*	But in csi things actually work
t1_dtiu6md	1	*	Congress doesn't need to declare war for there to be war.  You think there were no prisoners during the vietnam war either?

t1_dtiub1h	1	*	If the US is gone, I'm probably not gonna need to be on hunger strike any time soon.
t1_dtihit5	0	*	Not for the government 
t1_dtigzl9	0	*	What is instant sunlight? I tried google and it showed me a bunch of tanning beds. 
t1_dtijjvm	0	*	A trial is not one of those rights.
t1_dtj2fh5	1	*	See my edit. It's not really even controversial. 
t1_dtijmhv	1	*	A trial is not one of them.   ...and if they are caught without a uniform, you can execute them.
t1_dtifnpm	0	*	And previous AF1s already had refrigerators anyway.
t1_dtiw7ws	1	*	Who would have ever thought that SuperSchlong420 would be difficult to converse with? 
t1_dtja5ak	0	*	That's why they have the hearings. 
t1_dtj8jkv	0	*	So you didn't even read your own link and don't know how an EO works or that Congress controls the purse strings...wow.
t1_dtii1oz	1	*	Look, the government mouths the words, support our troops. Isn't that enough? Don't be greedy now. 
t1_dtifnbw	0	*	So, let's flush a couple billion extra down the drain because it won't make much of a difference? That sounds like something the fiscally conservative republicans *should* have a problem with.
t1_dtih54x	1	*	The problem is that to be both FAA and secret service certified, the small cupboard that would replace the fridge in order to hold the MREs would cost $15m.
t1_dtixqez	1	*	Now you are on to something there
t1_dtj9wfc	1	*	I think we've got the premise for a future season of Arrested Development!

t1_dtily8n	0	*	I don't think there can ever be a system put in place that would charge or not charge people correctly 100% of the time, that's the one reason there's always an argument about prison systems
t1_dtiy4sx	1	*	He sat on it for 2 years.  
t1_dtiousx	0	*	***people convicted for terrorism
t1_dtive3g	0	*	Should of been longer.  I think its strange that people write small articles to argue things no one will ever care about.  what ever floats their boat I guess

t1_dtihww9	1	*	How is that working out for your Native Americans?
t1_dtk8qlq	0	*	I see what you're trying to say, but I still believe the person doing the killing is more responsible. I'll agree to disagree on that point. Other than that I can get behind what you're saying.
t1_dtiee0r	1	*	Sadly no, they have to bus it to the plane. Luckily this fridge can hold like a month's worth of food. So like 97,000 big macs
t1_dtjfhob	0	*	So that means all anti war activists are as responsible for war as much as those who make it happen? What country are you from because i'm curious what your responsible for
t1_dtifcmi	1	*	They researched a teleporter to send burgers straight from Mickey D's to AF1!

t1_dtiivch	0	*	I had a hunch that this is what he meant, as I felt this way as well. Thanks for clarifying man.
t1_dtitc6n	1	*	He/she has every right too. The Marines are no joke. There is a reason why they are revered. 
t1_dtincby	1	*	They are probably made to shatter, when they do, into three dull pieces.
t1_dtinu3y	0	*	Not in the UK. In West Africa.   Trying to save lives in the 1st world is orders of magnitude more expensive.

t1_dtipqyq	1	*	I think the prisoners we have here in the US would love to be transferred to Gitmo.  Gitmo conditions are much better than US prisons.  That's even documented by the Red Cross.
t1_dtjlbij	1	*	fair enough then.
t1_dtiwzcu	0	*	How long did you spend writing that up?  your post history is depressing, so much time wasted, writing short stories that only 1 maybe 2 people ever read
t1_dtikj5u	1	*	So? Just because others do it too doesn't change what Trump does.

t1_dtiiar2	1	*	Even if, 2.4M for a fucking refigirator is ridicolous accept for if it's as big as a fucking city. 
t1_dtjgvpf	0	*	Do or don't. There is no try. :)   If Trump just issued an order to keep it open, then Obama could have issued an order to close it. But didn't. 
t1_dtj9c3g	0	*	Awww no I'd love to see them... but I'm banned... :(
t1_dt7lvxc	0	*	No, but he can randomly spout some of his projections on you, such as childish, contrarian, etc.
t1_dthu9xl	0	*	It always warms the heart to get to the bottom of the matter and find sniveling bigot. It's a shame they all lack self awareness. 
t1_dth92w1	0	*	The oligarchs tried to take back power, Yeltsin responded. I agree the method was wrong. But a democracy also means that the government have the right to use power.
t1_dthao8v	1	*	How about Canada? (that's me)  How about Germany.   How about modern Japan?  
t1_dthelzs	1	*	He lost his overview in the end, which is what made Putin get power. Not saying Yeltsin is perfect, but he was much better than Putin, thats for sure.
t1_dsszkuc	0	*	Tell that to innocent civilians shot by cops for picking their noses or murdered by soldiers by existing in a combat zone. They are all state sanctioned murders.
t1_dv3ve9v	1	*	Well if we can use each other's implications now:  >The kid's name is Lloyd Gunton... My bet isn't on him becoming even more radicalized in prison. 
t1_dv4x6vw	0	*	ye they mentioned it in passing... this kid needs an ass whooping not a life-sentence smh... 
t1_ds41xe0	1	*	That's cool. We used to pay 150 a pound but trimmers were scoring too much
t1_ds2csad	1	*	Not in everyone and when it does for most its mild. But yea there is some physical dependence possibility, comparable to cocaine, which is also considered to not be physically addicting. 
t1_dsfrky5	0	*	And in many more areas, it isn't. Your point?
t1_ds2aca9	1	*	unless it kills you, but yeah
t1_ds3hwz5	1	*	I have the fucked up front teeth, the bottoms are jagged, so I'm just ashamed to smile now, which is fine, because I seem to hate it, but probably because my mouth hurts :/

t1_dsebmn7	1	*	Ah crap. I totally misunderstood. My apologies. I'll take a closer look  it I completely missed mana's point here.
t1_dsea9tu	1	*	Great response.  Thanks 
t1_ds2ouj7	1	*	Mate he was giving you logical responses, don't be an ass and actually read them.
t1_ds4anms	0	*	Yes, NOT IN THE LEAST DUE TO THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WHO KEEP KILLING PEOPLE AND TRAINING TERRORISTS.
t1_dsgv84p	0	*	If the US paid, and it was a sale, does that make the land American? What did Egypt sell for their payments?
t1_dsgi255	1	*	This post is pure irony.
t1_du71d1j	1	*	They are popular everywhere until too many people die.
t1_du6opmy	1	*	Risky click of the day
t1_du6dyqk	1	*	No idea, and not my problems.
t1_du6igqb	1	*	Not condoning it, but thats pretty standard operating procedure for preventing an heir to the throne from later staking a claim to the throne.
t1_du5wxf2	0	*	I already explained why it was irrelevant.  Why do it again?
t1_du9gjpi	1	*	As opposed to most marketing teams who spend the budget on cocaine and celebrity endorsements?
t1_du6rof5	1	*	True, but to beat them it needs to be so much better other companies who take the YouTube approach won't be as successful. Otherwise it's just gonna be a state funded YouTube clone taking its place.
t1_du5z8u4	1	*	Keep working har!
t1_du6s9iq	1	*	Why? It's the right thing
t1_du6sacy	1	*	Yes
t1_du69snj	0	*	Yeah, well, all you give me in return is a bunch of demagogue stuff. I have an idea of how to tangibly steak votes - do something. Otherwise hes a nicer version of Zhirinovskiy. 
t1_ds8i3cd	0	*	Theres more than one reply, idiot, context clues. And your suggestion of omg lets fix the breed is greedy as hell. 
t1_ds928h3	1	*	> Hell, it's **common practice** to cull puppies that don't conform aesthetically  You're a conspiracy nut if you think this is common practice.
t1_ds8htjl	0	*	Is that a lot to you?
t1_ds8hc0y	1	*	I agree, but that's a different distinction than dogs are not people.   
t1_ds8sd5p	0	*	Alive is Gucci.   Murder is Versace. 
t1_ds90wmk	1	*	Mmmyes, and perhaps a dram of madiera for being a good sport.
t1_ds8p1u2	1	*	Lol fair point 
t1_ds8xf72	0	*	Haven't heard anything about that. Is that because they've gotten so popular in last couple years?
t1_dscsr40	1	*	Genetic erosion can cause genetic disorders.
t1_ds8fyaj	1	*	i dont think you understand how breeding works. its far more likely that they would have these issues at a higher rate. Mismatched sizes on dogs are a recipie for disaster when breeding.
t1_ds9i3qo	1	*	Lol he does!
t1_ds98bwr	0	*	Cop out. Didnt answer me. Just like princess. Again which breeds are we keeping? 
t1_ds8fy1y	0	*	Oh good, one of those morons who believes a dog can be 100% controlled in every situation.
t1_ds8mobz	1	*	Ah sorry about that! Redditing on mobile makes it difficult to keep track of conversation threads lol. 
t1_dsdlp7t	0	*	Why continue breeding them? There is no good reason other than humans like the way they look.
t1_ds8kzix	1	*	Except that it actually was directed specifically at me, but sure msn, whatever you say
t1_ds8olxc	1	*	Very good point. I'm firmly aboard the midget cat hype train.
t1_ds9c3pv	1	*	Our postman has treats too, which helped with our current dog (large munsterlander)....  Didn't stop the postman from being evil incarnate according to our previous dog.
t1_ds9mvbw	1	*	Just the other day I saw a gif of a Husky jumping his ass off to the top of a privacy fence. Those dogs are on meth. Pure meth.
t1_ds8x8po	1	*	Like my loafers? Former gophers. It was either that, or skin my chauffeurs.
t1_ds8owzg	0	*	Lol SO AGAIN which ones? Which dogs do we completely get rid of? Which ones do we keep? I want to know which dogs you think do not have genetic issues. 
t1_ds8u7qi	1	*	It is an excellent thoughtpiece on the issue after all!
t1_ds96exx	1	*	Well said. 
t1_ds8wcge	1	*	There is no point and there need not be one. Such is the beauty of living in a meaningless random Universe <3
t1_ds8nsby	0	*	The more people dive down on the semantics around Natural and Unnatural the more you realize that the whole concept is just a  strange paradox we humans have come up with. 
t1_ds8j6zg	0	*	Yes and you are still suggesting that we breed bulldogs with bulldogs which is going to massively slow down any solution just for the sake of keeping a breed you like the look of.
t1_ds8fmf0	0	*	you realize ive never said aything about killing the living ones right?   my issue is i dont agree with us selectively deciding to end a breed of dog because it might have respiratory issues. 
t1_ds8jcs0	0	*	dude Strawman all you want- it wont change the fact i think actively preventing them from breeding with the intent of making them extinct is wrong. 
t1_ds97bg3	1	*	Natural as the opposite of supernatural includes all things human.   Natural as the opposite of artificial excludes anything human.   That's how someone taught it to me. 
t1_ds8ilx6	1	*	Yeah I think we are too lol. It's alright, it's a fairly heated debate these days so I understand emotions getting involved. Thanks for the chat
t1_ds8q8vi	0	*	Beret of poodle on my noodle it shall rest
t1_ds8ju6v	0	*	Yeah they're not as varried as dogs in general, but compare it to like the Labrador  retriever and there's a lot of physical variance. 
t1_ds8vjc1	0	*	Personally, I don't think people should be allowed to due whatever they want. Salvaging the breed still means breeding generations of fucked-up dogs. To me, that sort of cruelty is wrong.
t1_ds99i05	1	*	Darn tootin.  #MidgetCatHype.
t1_ds8p0ax	1	*	Haha thank you! His parents were Star Wars themed so we felt the need to stick with it. :)
t1_ds99mf2	1	*	The Boston terrier isn't a species, so if they stop being bred it's not going extinct, it's a particular set of bad traits being removed from the *Canis lupus familiaris* gene pool.
t1_ds91zgf	1	*	Ok, let's test Kellyanne Conway and see what happens.
t1_ds8kgqj	1	*	Correct. We are outside the food chain. We get to use nearly whatever we want from the food chain to improve our lives. It's the nature of life, for better or worse.
t1_ds8x165	0	*	Its hard to explain assholes. Dont bother wasting the time trying. 
t1_ds18mxn	0	*	Really, take it somewhere else. I don't want to feed your trolling any further but this is bordering on sexual harassment.
t1_ds17q9m	0	*	God save the Queen!
t1_dsuahz9	0	*	So how do you explain losing six Ruskies for every Finn in the winter war just before WWII?
t1_dtxl8bq	0	*	are you under the impression that because a lot of people do something it can not be wrong? yikes!
t1_dtugh5c	1	*	Sure, but at the same time, it's not a joke at all. 
t1_dtfurcg	1	*	Words have meanings, perhaps an actual definition will help - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_market
t1_duspzk8	1	*	I am sorry I thought you were being sarcastic my friend, my bad.
t1_duczot3	0	*	Good on ye. Wish them a long and fulfilling journey. 
t1_dut6atr	0	*	You're just not getting it and being purposefully obtuse. Remain ideologically ignorant for the sake of ignorance. 
t1_dussmwe	0	*	Argument, komrat. And I didn't lose, I just took the ball home! is not the same thing. Sorry. Maybe in the Motherland.
t1_dszl94w	0	*	We have a fascist president. End of sentence.   Who's the most famous fascist in history?   Adolph Hitler.  That's where the comparison comes from.   Really easy to understand. 
t1_dt0bpm5	0	*	I didn't realize the Republicans had the 60 seats in the Senate required to break a Democrat filibuster and pass a bill.
t1_dt0ntmy	0	*	> If Mueller says nothing happened, would that satisfy you?  You haven't directly answered the question, I am not saying he will be found innocent but IF he is found innocent, would you accept it?
t1_dt0od67	1	*	No you can't get into heaven without a man in a dress putting a small amount of water on your forehead first. 
t1_dt09wdt	1	*	I think unbaptized babies go to purgatory. 
t1_dt0fw1b	1	*	*sprayed
t1_dt0d9e5	0	*	> also the republican voter base has been fed absurdities and disinfo through fox news for 30 years.  And you lot aren't being fed absurdities and disinfo through CNN/MSNBC news?
t1_dt09vxi	0	*	White/Caucasian is a race. 
t1_dt0ao5a	1	*	Yes, very logical points. I mean, if it happened in star wars...
t1_dt0rffk	0	*	Well see in the coming weeks. I cant wait to see Dems go to prison and for Obamas name to be tarnished worse than Nixons.
t1_dt0nzja	1	*	I doubt ole Farage is in that category somehow.   In the UK here, no-one has brought up the question of investigation except by the extreme bigots and even they are not pushing hard for it.
t1_dtjnjhr	0	*	I have been training Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu for 6.5 months now - I'm 200 pounds.  I imagine if I got into a street fight that I could get my ass kicked without panicking too much.  I've come a long way.
t1_dtj4lye	0	*	Statistically, women are way more likely to be raped than men (even black men), so I have no idea what you are talking about here.    You do not live in reality.  
t1_dtjh08e	1	*	Random insults now?  What a waste of time you are.
t1_dtj6mvg	1	*	I'm not sure if they actually run homeless shelters, but there is a history of Scientologists using drug rehabs as a recruitment tool. Check out [Narconon](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narconon).
t1_dtiratd	0	*	And I suspect you think the NHS will just pay for all this. Why dont we just make all the mentally unwell Labour MPs and kill 2 peasants with one bullet?
t1_dtiwwbl	0	*	So my home is apparently a backwater since it's not a famous metropolitan zone, but we somehow manage to have park benches that aren't covered in piss.  Astounding.
t1_dtj62vx	0	*	I'm sure so many homeless LGBT youth would love to have a chat with you about this.
t1_dtk8il0	1	*	Maybe.. Most rapes are committed by someone we're  acquainted with.. and its highly unlikely anyone will ever try to fight me.  I have the gokd fortune of being quite cavalier to be honest.  
t1_dtjwh1n	0	*	People like you should stay home to be honest
t1_dtj7ur5	1	*	I only answer when I feel like it. 
t1_dtjrqen	0	*	If there's no free will, you can't change their mind so why bother?
t1_dtmqrjm	0	*	Show me where she said it is right to demonize or shame them?
t1_dtj3olg	1	*	No. My statement wasn't specifically about homeless shelters.
t1_dtj8iq2	0	*	X = don't do drugs. Don't drink. Be home by a reasonable hour.  No visitors. Get free housing.   Y = Be homeless.   They choose Y.  You say they rather choose Y than X.   What else should we do?
t1_dtjd2ed	0	*	They cannot go over everyone's history, so they make a blanket rule.  
t1_dtkgv4j	1	*	Hate the sin, not the sinner.
t1_dtj0l5h	0	*	Empathy may only go so far for you, but I won't stop caring and trying to help people just because it's hard. 
t1_dtjlny8	0	*	> list of the school shooters  I mean, is there an article that delves into SSRIs and shootings? Or is this research you did?
t1_dtj2mue	1	*	You know, you can say fuck on the internet. Can say other naughty words too!
t1_dtixmeg	1	*	How about you stop sheltering people in a giant open room like they are boxes in a warehouse?
t1_dtj7viw	0	*	Hey guys! Totally *not* Michael Bay here... what do you think should happen next?
t1_dtj3750	1	*	Credibility has a lot to do with it, in which that post had zero. 
t1_dtj2owt	1	*	I would actually assume that these bars might invite people to piss and shit on them in retaliation.
t1_dtiy1x6	0	*	No one in my neighborhood would leave their car unlocked.
t1_dtji66q	0	*	Do you have any actual sources, not .org sites from homeless advocacy groups with websites that a high schooler could make?  
t1_dtjiyfm	0	*	How do you know where I live, sweetheart?  Calling what out? That I believe that peer reviewed sources are more reliable than one guys biased opinion... like anyone with any sort education knows
t1_dtiwlf2	0	*	I do actually. I currently live in one, and have lived in the other as well.
t1_dtj3w29	0	*	Ok, and Ill trust my source: me who has lived in multiple major cities and has never once seen a bench with piss or shit on it. But Im sure your park is just swimming in excrement.   
t1_dtk0i05	1	*	I've been there before. : )  I'm glad to hear youre managing it though, even if I wish it were easier and you didnt have to manage it.   Stay strong. 
t1_dtiyb97	1	*	So funny thing, usually pissing on benches is a grown ass adult thing or something young kids do.  
t1_dtixjix	1	*	Well, it is a solution. It doesn't solve the problem of homelessness, but that is something that takes years and huge amounts of funding. 
t1_dtkepuv	1	*	Not a liberal. Hope you get gunned down by a pig. 
t1_dtj6y2r	0	*	What if everyone supported human rights
t1_dtjb1ma	0	*	Behind a tree behind a building. Not on a park bench. Once again. Good effort 
t1_dtjkcu6	0	*	So not only random insults, but you are not even reading what is being written?  Like I said, you are just a waste of time.
t1_dtiy4kr	0	*	It's a solution to not having homeless people sleep on the bench. The goal isn't to fix homelessness by doing this. It's to stop people from sleeping on benches.
t1_dtp5tfq	0	*	Those women feel that their safety as contributing, law-abiding citizens takes precedence over the actions of those who do neither.  And I don't blame them.
t1_dtjfg62	1	*	Can't be worse than the ones so far.
t1_dtj708b	1	*	Oh, I thought you meant Scientology just wanted to help poor kids. Never mind.
t1_dtiyi65	1	*	To be fair the homeless there are just trying to wash away the smell of patchouli oil
t1_dtiwwm9	0	*	You just described pretty convincingly above how this is a complex issue and these people need help, but now you don't sound like you agree with yourself.
t1_dtk042c	0	*	Agreed, I dont disagree with the statistics at all, however you cant look at statistics to validate your position on this, and then blatantly ignore statistics on other uncomfortable truths. 
t1_dtivr1g	0	*	That's not really the same thing as some junkie alcoholic living on a park bench.
t1_dtjfnmx	0	*	really, if you have nothing to contribute...
t1_dtjgod1	0	*	Not really cos I'm happy to pay extra taxes to cover this. I also pay to a homeless charity but in reality I expect my government to help all of my society, not just the tax payers. 
t1_dtjoc7q	1	*	Huh I didn't know that. You have a source for this?
t1_dtj4hrb	0	*	Because it is the same line of reasoning as the ones who installed the bars. You don't want them near you. You don't want to face them directly.
t1_du817bk	0	*	If it helps, phantom basically means ghost, spirit or illusion.
t1_dthn3pk	0	*	You're being deliberately obtuse and I'm too tired  to play this game with you.
t1_dthqzji	0	*	So is arming Saddam Hussein with chemical weapons but you didn't see anyone in the US cry when Rumsfeld was shaking his hands. point?
t1_dth8vz8	0	*	You kinda missed the in the region part. Although I can probably think of a few countries that are better than Iran (Oman...Jordan maybe?).
t1_dste5rs	0	*	That's not An explanation but thx anyway
t1_dss9qcs	0	*	It's not the 1980s... The one child policy is over. China is not trying to curb population growth at all
t1_dtai8hg	0	*	No, my exact point is those guys were big men in Saudi government.  If MBS's position were less secure, he would not have dared.

t1_dto4wxn	0	*	there's absolutely no evidence of that. 
t1_dtoci0p	0	*	What does the memo have to do with Mueller? It's about FISA abuse. 
t1_dtoylcu	0	*	> I am able to see both as examples of Washington hypocrisy.  You sure don't act like it, at least not until you're called out.
t1_dtnxk17	1	*	His made up words are still worth more than your factless opinions.
t1_dtv0xe0	1	*	Did I now? Show me. 
t1_dtnxipe	0	*	And his TV interview with Lester Holt says otherwise.  I know which one a jury would believe.  Too bad impeachment proceedings are in Congress and not court.
t1_dtp6xnb	0	*	And youre referring to what exactly?  (...and more Trump supporter red herring arguments) we arent talking about Obama...or Hillary 
t1_dto2yr6	0	*	Quote of Gowdy saying the entire memo is moot?  As opposed to saying it about the memo in regard to the Mueller investigation?

t1_du8g4e1	0	*	LOL. The voting system here is as broken as your arguments... take the points your pals gave you and shove them up... you know where.   Enjoy.
t1_du77piv	0	*	It's bit hypocritical for him to complain about a bombing raid that drastically reduced the ability of the Nazis to fight the Soviets then. 
t1_du6kcsf	0	*	I'm Israeli so it matters to me. And good luck trying to forcibly annex a country with a few hundred nukes and missiles to send them to every inhabited continent on the planet.
t1_du6nwg0	0	*	I'm not sure where you hang out but socialism is not the left in this country.  You seem kind of like an insane person so I'll let this go.

t1_ds1hve5	0	*	I'm 100% for gay rights, but what more is there that can be done? You can get married, and anyone who refuses to offer you a service gets extreme public backlash and loses their business/job. 
t1_ds1i2lm	0	*	Without US actions in the gulf, Osama might never have gained power. Not judging right vs wrong, just that it's idiotic to give praise so easily.
t1_ds1fb8v	0	*	Where on Earth did I say that?   >are a huge massive country of 1 billion people and are aiming at becoming their own power *ala China*.  ala there means in the manner of.   
t1_ds1j1vs	0	*	GTA V inspiration?
t1_ds1j76b	1	*	ISIS probably wouldnt have ever existed if the US hadnt invaded in the first place.
t1_ds1gjtc	0	*	But he won't.
t1_ds1hd8o	1	*	We still do. doesn't mean we have to automatically hate everything America and what it stands for. 
t1_ds22gzi	1	*	We were butchering civilians on a daily basis. It was already war.
t1_ds1hezx	0	*	What do you want, a cash prize?  You don't deserve anything special and acting like you do makes you seem incredibly selfish.
t1_ds2pt6r	1	*	No it doesn't. Many people online are judgemental or just trolls. Also Trump is a little evil child so he's an exception you have to explain yourself a little extra
t1_ds1ijwy	1	*	You're right, they aren't the same. Obama never dropped 20,000 bombs in 7 different countries. 
t1_ds1il8y	1	*	  Happy New year, good sir!
t1_ds1nv36	1	*	Who was the previous leader of Iraq, anyway?  EDIT: See also: Iran
t1_ds1jlge	1	*	Yea I heard we had him surrounded and people nearby were basicaly given orders to stand down? I could be wrong though
t1_ds1hqmh	0	*	You mean like Obama and the dems bailing out the banks and insurance companies? Or how Obamacare makes the insurance companies richer and they are the primary winner of that bill?
t1_ds1gwjk	0	*	This keeps getting brought up, but you wouldnt fucking volunteer yourself and the people you know. Just some nameless others for the good of mankind.
t1_ds351nx	1	*	Osama must have estimated that an invasion of NYC would result in a million+ deaths. In that respect 911 was the lesser evil.
t1_ds1j2gy	0	*	If that was his goal then why become president? Why not just buy off politicians like everyone else and keep your dealings under the table?
t1_ds1nc84	0	*	Because of several very high profile cases where defense contractors shot the fuck out of public places for no reason other than that they could do so without facing any consequences.
t1_ds1nzld	1	*	There is no chance in hell they would nuke us or our allies for a simple airspace violation and to suggest otherwise is laughable 
t1_ds1kecv	1	*	the other party consistently pushes more taxes on the middle amd poor classes.
t1_ds1loiq	1	*	Lol...think smarter. 
t1_ds1f82s	1	*	The only winning move is f2#. 
t1_ds1ffud	0	*	These parties are both capitalists. They just have different sponsors, and one pretends to care about women and black people when convenient.
t1_ds1jqez	1	*	Apparently US does too these days..
t1_ds1i6gv	0	*	If you honestly believe that then you are probably 12 and haven't even started to get a grasp on basic history.
t1_ds1ibfb	0	*	I was in favor of defunding and abolishing the UN and using the savings to institute single payer. 
t1_ds1njy7	0	*	That's a non point? He's not doing anything to benefit himself.
t1_ds1i6mg	1	*	I heard Hillary was the pilot as Brian Williams hung from the helicopter ladder like Rambo whilst firing a machine gun and hurling grenades at Bin Laden's home.
t1_ds1filx	0	*	Do you really think Clinton would've pulled the US out of Afghanistan and Pakistan? Did Obama do that?  The military-industrial complex is bi-partisan.
t1_ds2l7vi	0	*	I suggest you work on yours. Where in the ever loving fuck does it say Saudi used 3 billion dollars to fund them? That's a conjecture based opinion piece quote you pulled there.
t1_ds2hzzh	1	*	The response from the MSM in reply to anything Trump does is mostly concocted outrage. If you're basing your worldview on reactions to events from the media I'm feeling sad for your lying eyes.
t1_ds1ow9s	0	*	I think the most likely path here is an executive order followed by heavy lobbying in Congress to cut it while the courts figure out the validity of the order. All this assuming he follows through.
t1_ds1fbju	0	*	It being valuable to China makes it valuable to America for geopolitical reasons. Nothing you've said is untrue, but it's not the full story.
t1_ds1ua7t	0	*	wait, don't you believe in international laws? US clearly broke many
t1_ds1frrb	1	*	They definitely thought they would win. Watch any documentary with the people who run the show. Now they did learn to not publicize a war nearly as much as what happened in vietnam.
t1_ds1khmi	0	*	Then it's a good thing the Armchair Generals of Reddit don't make the decisions. We keep using Pakistan.
t1_ds26f7p	0	*	Why doesn't that matter to you?
t1_ds1hz27	0	*	But he will benefit greatly from the tax bill. There are specific things in there to benefit him like ones for real estate developers or companies who earn income overseas from licensing agreements.
t1_ds1z2x1	0	*	You:  It was only symbolic  Me: It wasn't and money would have paid if we didn't withdraw.  You: let me move these goalposts a little.
t1_ds1jzqd	1	*	Nothing, because they weren't British children.
t1_ds1evv8	0	*	Yes, it was a peaceful region until we got involved.......
t1_ds1lhv4	0	*	Good God, Paul Bremer really fucked things up when he was put in charge. I mean, the man was so clueless he could have fallen into a bag of tits and somehow come out sucking a dick.
t1_ds1fdq1	0	*	He (Gary Webb) was suicided. 
t1_ds1h1zi	1	*	No one survives life. 
t1_ds1hjt2	1	*	Yes, it's almost like he has no penis
t1_ds1orfq	0	*	the Iraqi soldiers wouldn't just say lol ok nevermind and leave  Sure about that? Given they way they've fought since we started handing over the reigns, I don't think that would have been a surprise.
t1_ds1s056	1	*	There's no conspiracy here. They just don't reveal it to the public because there was no need to
t1_ds1llw0	1	*	I think its pretty easy to distinguish leadership making tough decisions vs people actually putting in ground work and grinding on a daily basis. Maybe Im just astute xaf\\\_()\_/xaf 
t1_ds1k4dy	0	*	You didn't read the article, did you?
t1_ds1eu5o	1	*	Username oddly checks out.
t1_ds1enko	1	*	But Pak does...

t1_ds1iesm	0	*	What would you like to see? What can I do as a straight person that you cannot?
t1_ds1pz7i	0	*	>how dare they try that soldier for killing 3 civilians.
t1_ds1lm3o	1	*	Just remember, Trump is scotch so he has been aging in a barrel for many years and has no grasp on reality
t1_ds1lluf	1	*	Yeah, America has a talent for ruining stable nations
t1_ds1nk9g	1	*	They hit us on 9/11 on US soil.  That wasnt a threat?  The Middle East is a clusterfuck of thousands of years of war.  The US is a relatively new entrant into the disaster that is the Middle East.  
t1_ds1gp0k	1	*	Haha I venture out from time to time 
t1_ds1kpi4	0	*	Veggie helicopters? Sounds awesome!
t1_ds3m624	0	*	An appeal to ridicule is a logical fallacy and is not a valid argument, so it's safe to say I was correct all along. Just as expected. Cya.
t1_ds1fqvy	1	*	The only one who's short sighted here is you. You lack empathy. 
t1_ds1tin7	0	*	Negatively impact?  As though our reputation and popularity in the middle East is at jeopardy?
t1_ds1rihh	1	*	Few years? I doubt you'll get to 2019 before massive cuts to spending to match the tax cuts. Or at least GOP will try to make them.
t1_ds1h47c	0	*	> Everyone should want peace.  Also everyone should be fair and kind to people and never hurt others. Everyone should want to work together for the betterment of humanity. Etc...etc ..
t1_ds1vfve	1	*	I don't think Ceaser ever made it out of the Mojave. The NCR took control of the Hoover dam and Helios One and that was the end of Ceaser and his band of savages.
t1_ds1ltah	1	*	Maybe we can use this to get rid of the Indians..?  - Thomas Jefferson. 
t1_ds1xyq8	1	*	Just gotta look at everything. Plus being blunt works, but what good does it do when it just looks like empty platitudes via twitter? Idk. 
t1_ds2pzad	0	*	Ikr not like that will increase tensions between two nuclear armed power or anything..... Ever hear of Kashmir?
t1_ds1khb4	1	*	I think there's a TV series that's either is just about to start or just did start on that. 
t1_ds1jy6b	0	*	Their government is not that weak. Even it falls their army will step in.
t1_ds1n7un	1	*	Yeah if they were willing to go for the suicide by cop route they could take many an American with them. But most acquire nukes in the hopes of not having to use them.
t1_ds1nv8l	0	*	No benefit it's just that you shouldnt associate with terror states
t1_ds2hygi	0	*	Lol because all of the generals would have to admit to classified information to declare if it is true and that happened. Missing an /s I hope
t1_ds1jn7w	1	*	Without city planning we couldn't have zoned the lot or approved the theater building permits. 
t1_ds1tw7k	1	*	Perhaps you have a problem with jailing human rights activists and executing them? Because he's stepped that up. 
t1_ds1jgki	0	*	We have auditors go in and track it. We can also easily track where they spend it when they are buying the food, weapons, and medical supplies directly from us. Its not hard to track. 
t1_ds1i93n	0	*	Do you think that has to do with population or with the fact that China has a GDP of 11 trillion dollars?
t1_ds1fd0d	0	*	Wow a journalist was fired. The CIA really showed them! 
t1_ds1ivy4	1	*	I think that is equally plausible. 
t1_ds1jpye	1	*	Thanks :)
t1_ds1p0c3	1	*	It is........
t1_ds1l49a	1	*	Those getting slaughtered by ISIS may argue that replacing one evil with another isn't so great. 
t1_ds1fjs6	1	*	This isn't a move for legacy, this is a distraction from his legal troubles.
t1_ds27ret	0	*	Prove it
t1_ds1fiqs	0	*	Not really, He's done lots of good things so far along with bad. My favorite was him pulling us out of TPP.
t1_ds1ierh	0	*	Still got a lot of work to do if he wants to out-suck Buchanan 
t1_ds1me5h	0	*	I understand your reasoning. I don't disagree.  But again...  Do you want to bet the fate of the world on it?
t1_ds1mg68	1	*	you endorse it. you own it. makes it yours. btw still not a move.
t1_ds1y43t	0	*	Yes it is.  > Four. We can't cut off aid because we don't give them any.  If you cut off aid, that becomes true. Does it not?
t1_ds1i4z7	1	*	So really this is George Washingtons fault. If we had just let the crown rule us like a good colony none of this fuckery would be happening. 
t1_ds1hzqx	0	*	Is this sarcasm? An ally country that aides and abets terrorists and was hiding a man who killed thousands of non-combatant civilians and planned to kill more. Fuck that   
t1_ds1ec9o	0	*	So do you consider the Warsaw ghetto uprising of Polish Jews against the Nazis to be terrorists? That's a genuine question.
t1_ds1fxnw	0	*	Fuck the nukes the technology would be spread like chickenpox. 
t1_ds1u3ts	1	*	> never known peace  Probably the most easily debunked claim possible. Do you know anything about Afghanistan? Or just what you feel it to be?
t1_ds1pnbs	1	*	and the government doesn't sell it..it allows the manufacturers to sell.
t1_ds1y4g6	1	*	Well they just passed their tax reform bill without touching it, so it's probably broken.
t1_ds1qhr6	1	*	I read parts of it. It's like we're handing our position over. 
t1_ds1rwxc	0	*	Crime and legal systems.... get the fuck out of here.  Nukes and an unstable government can be understood as bad by a 10 year old.  Very simple and very obvious to any adult 
t1_ds1gvrj	1	*	Are you saying the US supported them as recently as 2016? I think you need a source for that.
t1_ds1gffp	0	*	The Democrats, got it
t1_ds1fs3r	0	*	Go out more, it's a scary world friend
t1_ds1frlz	0	*	WHAT? We supported ISIS? This is the biggest bullshit lie I have heard. 
t1_ds1iacb	0	*	>fuck it why not  Andrew Jackson, probably
t1_ds1o4by	0	*	Not even close. 
t1_ds1h7d4	1	*	Yeah, I don't recall Obama personally waterboarding or snooping people's packets. Yet he gets all the blame :p
t1_ds1h3d9	0	*	 Did he not attempt to ban transgendered people from being in the military?
t1_ds23zah	1	*	Ah, so youre an asshole by choice. How lovely
t1_ds1phhq	0	*	Is that real? What sort of scale was it on though? I feel like it was just one or two neighbourhoods and people blow it out of proportion.
t1_dtq1828	0	*	See above
t1_dtq3em9	1	*	The fun part there is ms-13 started in LA. We spread the gang elsewhere, not vice versa.
t1_dtq1kpo	1	*	Dont have an answer for that one huh?
t1_dtq18je	0	*	Do they have right of return enshrined in law?
t1_dtqs6i9	0	*	The fact that theyre a social construct is irrelevant here.  The settlements are hostile, they do not promote mutual freedom of movement which is what I value.     
t1_dtq1gdr	0	*	Who was the last Arab Muslim Israeli Prime Minister? I'll wait. 
t1_dtq3qwi	0	*	Immigration has gone on for millennia. Cultures change. Its not static. 
t1_dtr9t3b	0	*	Again I am not talking about organic ethnostates. I am talking about multicultural places like the west and the middle east. You cannot create an ethnostate there. Thats genocide.
t1_dtrclhs	1	*	Fair enough.
t1_dtqo4ma	0	*	Etzion Bloc is an illegal settlement built in Palestinian territory.  
t1_du39ebk	1	*	I would say things about you but they would get me banned. 
t1_du1tmx7	0	*	Hmmmmmmmm
t1_du2optc	0	*	Yeah, they could retaliate with chemical weapons. Once.
t1_du1cvmo	1	*	Then let's hope the US stays a superpower for a while.
t1_du1hnjo	0	*	Israel's military is significantly more advanced than its neighbours. That's not even up for debate. 
t1_du1sbh0	0	*	White Phosphorus.   Shalom.
t1_du1ilrq	1	*	Looking again at your last comment makes me question whether you'll get it.
t1_du1tsju	1	*	Never been there.
t1_du1kjui	1	*	Sure, but you would have to kill off the entire population, no one likes dictators
t1_dtprxit	0	*	You get paid to donate plasma?
t1_dtr88ov	0	*	His username is J_Kevorkian.  He just spams jack kevorkian quotes.  You know, the suicide doctor? I laughed.
t1_dtqca6c	1	*	And judging from how piracy doesn't seem to affect sales much, that portion of the pirates is not particularly large. Either way it shows piracy perhaps *can* be wrong but oftentimes isn't.
t1_dtq1i7j	1	*	None. Anecdotal and empirical evidences of people downloading around me or discussing it on Reddit (for example).  I guess we disagree on the topic. Have a good Sunday.
t1_dtpvs9m	0	*	I'll try to find what site it was, just give me some time
t1_dur03i1	0	*	You mean play dirty like Hillary getting the debate questions from CNN or Hillary paying money to the DNC to take orders from her?
t1_dur3fr3	1	*	He doesn't believe anything. It's a 27 day old reddit account with pro-trump/whataboutism comments only. Perfect example of a troll account
t1_dt7pt3x	1	*	You're complaining about whataboutism when you're using the same thing. LOL, you're just as bad.
t1_dsq65p6	0	*	Christianity went through this little movement called secularism.  Basically we stopped enforcing most of the bad shit.  Islam has gone through no such movement.  https://youtu.be/XHLKFFq74Gk?t=136
t1_dspju4y	1	*	So you get more of a punishment for crime against a minority? That's insanity.
t1_dso98ql	0	*	I don't know what kind of fucked up life you've had, but siblings tend to be protective of each other, particularly brothers to their little sister isn't some crazy assertion.
t1_dspy5ij	0	*	Seriously, try it, it is not that hard.  I was wrong.  
t1_dsnpd5a	1	*	They link the evidence you don't have to trust them.
t1_dsq5wk9	1	*	If you need evidence for something well known I think you're ignorant to the subject.  Don't debate if you don't know what you're talking about.
t1_dsplfbn	0	*	Nah that's the sound Jabruddin makes when i beat him for driving slowly.
t1_dsndfxi	0	*	Yes, the OP said: There have only been 3 incidents in the US.  The guy who replied said NO U NAZI DONT U REMEMBER QUEBEC
t1_dssrqal	1	*	Hey bud did you forget to log out of your alt account?  Or just like jumping in to random people's arguments?
t1_dsqh4di	1	*	Poe's law is not a joke, it is definitely real
t1_dutzo0k	0	*	But why now?  What's changed other than their nuclear gains?  Plenty of time between then and now to finish it. 
t1_dut9il4	0	*	Just like England back in the day, eh?
t1_dusxkeh	1	*	He's gonna need some Aloe for that burn, stat.
t1_duu69ly	1	*	People seem to forget that China is nowhere close to a democracy 
t1_duswrsp	1	*	It's clear you are a troll account. Goodbye.
t1_dutbdtd	0	*	Look at my edit.
t1_dusx8sw	1	*	I guess you didnt read the definition lol. 
t1_dut6ai4	1	*	Trump is capable of doing things that Moon can not and Moon is acknowledging that.
t1_duvkd3d	1	*	I'm not too thrilled to debate someone who instead of trying to correct and educate someone else simply says that I am wrong, providing no proof of that claim, and then leaves the conversation.
t1_du2wik8	0	*	The good old days. When /u/Byoobsincalifornia was still with us.
t1_du37k64	0	*	Every fucking country does that. It doesn't make the original comment less irrelevant.
t1_du2ygbe	0	*	And my opinion is you're overreacting to something that wasn't even a joke.   It was a sarcastic quipp followd with an honest question. Welcome to Reddit
t1_du2wuzj	1	*	>But historically weve rarely gone this long, so we are kind of waiting for it to happen.  >In which case every day without accidents brings you closer to one.  Uh, no.
t1_du2xakz	1	*	unlike /u/Byoobsincalifornia he crashed.
t1_du34vos	1	*	I guess that's true. I'll still take my chances with a car accident.
t1_du2y3uq	1	*	They kept it to your imagination. 
t1_du2wrdf	0	*	Sometimes its plane to see.
t1_du3d47f	1	*	Or is it?
t1_du4e034	0	*	Hmm that's some cool information to hear, I guess we'll have to wait and see what we're told.
t1_du2wy9d	1	*	To think it's already been 26 minutes! Feels like just yesterday.
t1_du39b4o	1	*	17/m/new zealand  I'd have to swim the pasific ocean to meet up, I am not definitely taking a plane.
t1_du8gweb	0	*	I don't think I won't ever be an accident, I think the risks are lower because I understand the situations that limit my control if something happens and purposefully avoid being in them.
t1_du3alsq	0	*	I'm trying to understand why the plane.crashed if it's mostly autonomous, I'm not implying anything, wtf?
t1_du2zcq0	1	*	Relax and let the liquor flow

t1_du3156t	1	*	I'm guessing a reference to this?  https://youtu.be/SdfVIdsufI8  If not, still worth a watch... 
t1_du33e6q	0	*	You're right that that's an accident, not an incident. He's right that incidents aren't crashes. You're right that significant damage is enough to constitute an accident.
t1_du34pxo	0	*	That's not true. You don't only fear things based on the % chance it has at killing you.
t1_du39z9l	1	*	And what's the month number? 2. Whats 11-2... 9! And what's that mean.. 9/11. Bah gawd 
t1_du2wshs	0	*	too bad his plane couldn't
t1_du2ztjr	0	*	Oh that's exactly what i needed to hear to cure my fear of flying.  My hands sweat so much I can see my reflection in them. This is what i needed to hear. 
t1_du30jht	1	*	Nah its not ironic. Its a coincidence 
t1_du30c09	1	*	Unless of course there's never going to be another accident. Then we're just moving farther away from the last one.  Though that's unlikely. Sooner or later, something's bound to go wrong.
t1_du32agd	1	*	Not him anymore, rip in pieces. 
t1_du3r6ol	1	*	No idea? I said earlier if the person feels unconformable then obviously don't do it. I think I understood that part.
t1_du4gt2t	1	*	Driving a 560hp Mercedes on a German Highway without Speedlimits is hella fun. And legal. And quite safe assuming one is no american ( couldn't resist :p ) 
t1_du3ae43	0	*	Doesn't make me feel any better haha

t1_du2x9pe	1	*	Unlike that Russian plane.
t1_du61v9e	1	*	Source it then.
t1_du31qtq	0	*	You are much more likely to be killed by a cop in this country than to be shot in a school shooting, on school property or any other way you want to phrase it...
t1_du2wmp3	1	*	Well apparently he was gay...and I dont mean john Keats poem gay.  I mean deep dish sausages in any hole queer.

t1_du31pnt	1	*	Too bad his plane didn't :(
t1_du48wch	1	*	Those claims doesn't look too legit to be honest. I get where you're getting at and I hope they work hard to make sure that the avionics stays incorruptible I the future.

t1_du30x7p	0	*	It's like RAAAAIIIIAAAIIINNN
t1_du32jli	0	*	The fact you might die isn't scary, you would just have to walk around afraid all the time if that were the case. Falling down 10 000 km in a giant metal tube is what's scary.
t1_du39oa6	1	*	It's been hours by now. Can you report back? /u/Byoobsincalifornia

t1_du2zhg7	1	*	Its obviously a joke...
t1_dt5qme3	0	*	Why is the USA worth the effort? Youre taking thats for granted. I am a US citizen, but I want lived in the USA in years - Ive been much more successful and happier making my trade in Asia.

t1_dt51amm	0	*	stop making so much sense you're really derailing these people lol
t1_dt5xtvb	0	*	Tell me about it.  We have had immigration laws on the books for a long time, and politicians in both parties keep trying to make sure they arent enforced.

t1_dt5s33r	1	*	What part of that applies to the people known as 'Dreamers'? Absolutely none. 
t1_dt4x8q4	0	*	This is America, theyll find a way to fit in. If they have the same background as a Norwegian, theyre probably able to get along with other educated folks.
t1_dt5s3p7	1	*	Public service. 
t1_dt5izdw	1	*	oh, yea sure the majority do vote for them so to them immigrants are a net positive.
t1_dtb9dbh	0	*	...and women couldn't vote until the early 20th Century.  I'm not sure either has to do with the Emancipation Proclamation, though.
t1_dsvu82j	0	*	until theres a referendum with over 60% turnout with no abstentions you are wrong

t1_dse3c9a	0	*	SWIFT boat veterans for truth ? Do they ring a bell ? Youd be amazed at what kind of bullshit candidates have to put up with. Thats the dark side of the 1st.

t1_dsdybme	0	*	I like Adam Schiff, he can beat Trump, because hes average joe USA, and a patriot. Are you worried about the bernie bros?

t1_dsmv4od	1	*	I have trouble counting to 241 so it's yuge
t1_dtpe8bc	0	*	In Area C of the West Bank, there is martial law. That makes soldiers officers of the law. In any case, is slapping and kicking not punishable in your civilized country?
t1_dtao0zh	0	*	The function isn't to deter hijackers, it's to deter bombers like the shoe guy, the underwear guy, that guy with the laptop that got the timing wrong and whoever blew up that Russian plane in Egypt.
t1_dtcdjig	0	*	Guess that's lucky seeing words hurt you delicate flowers.  Also, I am not American dickhead ;) 
t1_dta4xng	0	*	That's a silly distinction without a difference
t1_dta2y2v	0	*	Eh, personally I thought people made a bit too much of a thing out of it.
t1_dtadib8	0	*	Calling someone a nazi isnt an insult, its an accusation and an attack on their character. That kind of suit happens all the time. Do you own research 
t1_dtbs39y	1	*	I'm on a moral crusade against stupidity including things like the fucking retarded no liquid rule.
t1_dta3gh0	1	*	Then the US has a pass.
t1_dtax516	1	*	But because of power roles it's not okay for a person to tell a police officer they are being a fucking idiot informally?

t1_dtadqbg	1	*	then you're a good person in my book
t1_dtam0q6	0	*	The fact that 50% of offenders are blacks surely means theres something wrong/racist about the system that leads to more black offenders
t1_dt9zmab	0	*	There you go. Suddenly being anti genocide for EVERY race makes me a white supremacist. Jesus man get a grip. Genocide threats are NOT harmless no matter who they are against. 
t1_dta7uce	0	*	The fact that it's 100% useless and still insanely expensive is a reason though. Also, for some of us our time is extremely valuable.
t1_dta5sxo	0	*	> Have you ever been to another western nation?  Nearly 20.
t1_dtai87d	0	*	did you actually read the article?  And I don't think you understand what fascism is.
t1_dtabt4k	0	*	See my other answer I gave you. They regularly broke the law. I don't know in which you country live in, but in Germany you get investigated for that.
t1_dta5wvo	1	*	Yeah, the Key and Peele skit on this subject is an exaggeration of nothing. There's no smoke without fire.
t1_dta3f17	0	*	Fuk, I was lied to by my maths teacher 8 years ago.

t1_dta0ka8	1	*	Get em bro! Facialize those lesser folk!!
t1_dtckxd8	0	*	It's not name calling, it's the truth. You're bigoted against america, the country you live in apparently, but whatever. Have a nice day. Please move to asia where you will be happy.
t1_dtbhrij	0	*	To note: the n-word in Germany is likely Neger, which means negro. Not much better, but still a difference.
t1_dt9ya7z	0	*	Only low level math. That's definitely not true of any theory class. I doubt there are any applied math majors though. That's probably just engineering and computer science. 
t1_dtaazir	1	*	You are a hero sir

t1_dt9ydt3	0	*	>police state  Thank you from the bottom of my heart. I haven't had a good ol' fashioned eye-roll like that in a long time.
t1_dta66op	0	*	I think it's crazy that your ability to vote in national elections is dependent on the state you live in. Some states make it incredibly convenient to vote while others make it incredibly difficult.
t1_dt9qo5o	0	*	Are you going to make a point or just keep asking questions?
t1_dtaibbi	1	*	That's Numberwang!
t1_dta6mdo	0	*	Prove it. My honor against yours.
t1_dta2ixu	0	*	> Germany tried freedom of speech. You know how that went.  Are you seriously blaming freedom of speech for the rise of the Nazis?  You're making my head hurt.
t1_dtam66x	1	*	Because they're Bavarian! 
t1_dta6a74	0	*	Its hilarious that youre saying that while low key insulting Americans directly.   You ruin discourse. Maybe thats why you see it so often. 
t1_dt9xs70	1	*	Fair enough. Just figured there might be a chance it would get taken as a joke or you as being insane because thats a ridiculous fucking thing to say in Israel. 
t1_dta40lo	1	*	I need 15 min on his Twitter to realize that he's racist and seist. Or we'll maybe he himself isn't but his words to get ppl to like vote for him are. 
t1_dtbksf8	1	*	But if you order an Uber before landing how will you know you can get there in time? Will Uber drivers wait a long time for you? Ive never had an Uber wait for me...this could be life changing 
t1_dtai281	0	*	I didn't act like an asshole, I don't think, but I get a bit defensive when someone makes an offensive generalization about a group I belong to (so about me).  
t1_dtbq7fo	1	*	Apparently because they're morons like most transportation security theater. 
t1_dtatm0s	0	*	Aka inciting violence and riots.... Like I've said a million times in the comments.
t1_dtajrho	0	*	I think you're playing dumb and your participation here at least in these threads is insincere. You know they're Nazis you know what they're chanting you know what's at stake. 
t1_dtad63x	1	*	Show me. Is it a ton? Is it 1% of commenters? 25%? .001%? 
t1_dta8thc	0	*	Everyone with a legal costs insurance. And probably a lot of other people, too.
t1_dt9zann	1	*	I mean, pretty much. If this, then this. Unless this.
t1_dtcj7j1	1	*	But poor people also pay for welfare, even if they don't use it. The same goes for government sponsored education.
t1_dta6tz2	0	*	Being insulted in public cause damage to your public image.
t1_dtbjqhv	0	*	Not in Germany, every insult is slander.
t1_dtaa0m3	0	*	I don't know man. Maybe just follow the fucking law?
t1_dt9zwpw	0	*	So why go to a college for STEM? Turn it into a trade school.
t1_dt9q5f1	0	*	I'm Australian if it makes you feel any better. 
t1_dtarz33	0	*	It depends.  Girl I know got a degree in communications and she bought her first condo in a hip neighborhood by 25 working in PR.
t1_dta5a20	1	*	Math probably takes the least amount of memorization of a the STEM fields.
t1_dt9zbwh	1	*	Lmfao! Yup the whole field of study is just like middle school algebra.... its as simple as pi.
t1_dt9wzli	1	*	It wasn't at the time.
t1_dta0m7j	1	*	such an *efficient* language
t1_dtak890	1	*	I'd guess because of a long history, as you said, Bavaria having used to be a kingdom and being always richer than most of the other German states. 
t1_dta5r16	0	*	> anti-American zealot.   No, you just have the largest gulf between where you should be and where you are.
t1_dtasbt9	1	*	Then you're in luck.
t1_dta3aa8	0	*	And if one refuses to pay the fine?
t1_dtaa21b	0	*	What are you talking about?  I haven't said they are similar to Nazis.  I'm sitting here telling you that I agree calling people Nazis is dumb.  
t1_dtaet5n	1	*	It isn't. 
t1_dtaa67x	0	*	Outside the US, most people only know of the Washington with international relevance.
t1_dta68v9	1	*	Oh wow. I just looked it up and you're right. I assumed germany was at least hitting the 2-3% mark like the UK but I stand corrected. This is what I get for just talking out of my ass
t1_dta6bwr	1	*	No. I said you were a minority for not voting for Trump AND not being fat. Reading comprehension is difficult for Americans I know, might be all the sugar.
t1_dt9zaqa	1	*	Fucking lol
t1_dta7i76	1	*	LOUD NOISES 
t1_dtaro6d	1	*	I'm german, of course I'm fascist. Now stay away you dirty foreigner. Stick to our rules or go somewhere else, it's that simple.
t1_dtb2hqc	1	*	This is the law in question. https://germanlawarchive.iuscomp.org/?p=752#130
t1_dta72e4	0	*	And yet i can count the number of people killed by German police on 1 hand.   Fuck, i can actually count the total number of killings on 1 hand for 2015, 2014 and 2013.
t1_dt9yb4v	1	*	Already knowing this is bait.  That is only true if you've taken the most elementary math classes and nothing else.  Even then if that's all you're doing u probably didn't do well
t1_dtas7rq	1	*	And, like clockwork, another frightened little T_D lad chimes in. Lol. 
t1_dta01yc	0	*	I was wrong so now all I've got left is a one word answer to show how little I care.  ...  But in doing so I prove I cared, oh shit.
t1_dta1j3b	0	*	Actually I'm not sure what you are talking about? If you're referencing the 3rd Reich, there definitely was no freedom of speech. If you're referencing something else then I genuinely don't know.
t1_dt9zkn3	1	*	Is /s really necessary?
t1_dta0b87	0	*	I guess you're right, that happens in Germany as well. The point is that this law rarely ever affects anyone unless they seriously go overboard with it.
t1_dtayenx	1	*	People getting mad at certain words is different to the government charging you for using those words, you idiot 
t1_dt9ybxr	0	*	There's a significant overlap between the mathematics in cs and philosphy
t1_dtam9yr	0	*	Okay, so who owns your water supply?

t1_dta64fq	1	*	I bet you liked it, you slut ^^^^no ^^^^/s
t1_dtaqbqr	1	*	Possessing *large amounts* of marijuana is a felony.  Also, the state with the three strikes law is California.
t1_dtat27n	1	*	> A word only carries the weight people ascribe to it. If most people think calling someone a nazi nowadays is a pretty petty insult, then it is one.  Only the right thinks it is a petty insult. 
t1_dta9ks1	1	*	> So really it's a deposit rather than a fine  Yes thats correct
t1_dtbct59	1	*	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volksverhetzung
t1_dtabf3z	0	*	Gonna go ahead and say no on that one. Never heard anyone call liberals Nazis. Liberals are socialists/commies, conservatives are Nazis/Klanmembers. Welcome to American politics. 
t1_dtakvwa	1	*	No send help
t1_dta4gjz	0	*	So you don't care about majors but clearly you do?
t1_dtacpen	1	*	Ah pretty interesting. Your first post made it seem less of a problem than it actually is when looked at from my own perspective.  Now that you expand on it it does make for a very convoluted system. 
t1_dt9xnrx	0	*	You could have just told me right away that you're a troll, would have saved me the time it took to google ignorance. Not cool my dude.
t1_dta83r5	0	*	so you're saying you listened to nothing I said?
t1_dta3oz7	0	*	What harm? The only instances of harm that you seem to say are terrorist attacks in Germany. Alt Right Germans would never attack someone, that's how you go to jail forever. 
t1_dta3a73	0	*	And if one refuses to pay the fine?
t1_dta760v	1	*	Because you're making mountains out of a molehill.

t1_dta2isp	0	*	It was just that one.  
t1_dtaszb4	0	*	...at least that's what your gouvernment-controlled media keeps telling you.
t1_dt9yhrn	1	*	Bullfuck. The average police officer has busted just as many people for victimless crimes as the average Nazi busted people just for the same thing. 
t1_dta764o	0	*	Blood: Irish, Scottish, Norwegian, French, and English.  Birth: England.  I live here for the money.
t1_dtbinln	1	*	Oh, didn't mean that it *warrants* media coverage. Just, in Denmark it tends to get it, as it's highly unusual. 
t1_dtbejkc	0	*	Why are you trying to put down and insult America?
t1_dta89jb	1	*	Been there. Sarcasm depends so much on tone sometimes it can be hard to read.
t1_dtaater	1	*	Nah, here everyone calls everyone else a Nazi.
t1_dtbtvn5	0	*	Among the counter-protesters, sure. Already knew that. 
t1_dtaav34	0	*	I got herpes and I've never been to a whore house. I should try catch some terrorists. 
t1_dta890k	0	*	Oh yeah that's what I meant with the state knowing about it. Someone actually has to bother to file charges.  I probably worded it a bit poorly in my attempt to explain it.
t1_dtafx5e	1	*	I completely agree. Was just checking.
t1_dtdhloq	0	*	There hasn't been a difference between insulting civilians or officials for decades.
t1_dszs8cq	1	*	I'll be so rich when I go to the karma store
t1_dszmira	0	*	I'm aware of what happened in the past, that's why I added that caveat.  Modern demographic replacement isn't lethal

t1_dunbhmm	0	*	Yes and you have no proof the guy you are accusing is part of it. I could call you a Russian troll, it's pretty easy to stoop that low.
t1_dumukk3	1	*	lol good luck with that!

t1_duad8fi	0	*	I thought you are Clinton supporter.
t1_duatqp1	0	*	The topic at hand is that we're still intervening in New countries under Donald and going further than Hillary even advocated. Thoughts ? Or more jumbled Twitter talking points?

t1_duquxko	1	*	Meh, close enough.
t1_duqggxv	1	*	All these organizations are connected. We dont trust anything anymore. Too many lies. Agitprop.
t1_duqa4z2	0	*	> Ill need a $23,000 medical procedure just to break even on my car  I don't understand, can you elaborate please?
t1_duqrkwx	1	*	There is a return on donations. The return is an increase in some positive effect. If I donate to a prostate cancer awareness organization I expect them to use that money to counter prostate cancer.
t1_duqbbko	0	*	!uoY
t1_duqbbp5	1	*	For my benefit then, could you please clarify what the problems with the primary were?
t1_duqs6vi	1	*	Agreed. But this one was Russian. Who according to the left is at war against our democracy. 
t1_duq81fd	0	*	Too late
t1_duqom3q	1	*	I mean, your original point was dumb.. that's kind of the point I was making. Glad you caught that...
t1_duqb3vf	0	*	Because there isn't a reliable source of information anymore 
t1_duqf8iv	1	*	We all got proper fucked!!
t1_duqdpfo	0	*	If extra cost was considered detrimental and as undue hinderance in this case, there wouldn't be a tax on gun sales.
t1_duqearg	0	*	Much easier to stop a gun war than drugs. 
t1_duqloca	0	*	Eh, usually constitional law professors are hesitant to incite constitutional crises.
t1_duqcl7z	1	*	They can't function without an other to demonize.
t1_duqc6wx	0	*	They might be destroyed if they do send out nukes en masse, but I promise you they would also fuck a lot of people's day up if they pressed that big red button.
t1_duqjekq	0	*	ACA was garbage and made my life a little worse. Socislist agenda costin' me money cause I don't need dang insurance, with that individual mandate thst I'm SO GLAD trump removed.
t1_dv4csx2	1	*	You're essentially starting with the premise that they're agenda doesn't deserve opposition or criticism. Which is clearly very arguable. That's why I'm confused about what you're saying. 
t1_duqdnj9	1	*	Crap, he already heard! Uhhh... do you have enough pitchforks to take on his admittedly already well-pitchforked army?
t1_duqjubn	0	*	Would you prefer an extreme left wing judge that would remove parts of the 1st amendment related to hate speech, delete the 2nd entirely, etc?
t1_duq6sd7	0	*	Wonderful.  I'm just pointing out that being stoned isn't the same as possession and Castle being stoned really doesn't justify his summary execution by a policeman. 
t1_duqf8ku	0	*	> Mitch McConnell being one the worst people in congress EVER.  Hes one of the worst people on the planet ever. The list of people who have done more damage to us as a species is rather slim.
t1_duq7vbp	0	*	Because you're a successful troll ?   I'm upset? That's why you're following me around to multiple threads leaving your angsty comments?  Right on trolly.
t1_duqtxpk	0	*	I think my citing actual facts is the proof.
t1_dur3ezc	1	*	When Democrats created the precedent in 2013 ppl cheered. I told them to be weary what they wish for. Democrats opened the door and Republicans walked on in
t1_duq730b	1	*	Well he doesn't have a cockney, but his cock does go to his knees I think.

t1_dur3dvo	0	*	So how does the nordic model fit into your theory?
t1_dur5xwq	0	*	Never said that. Certainly would be nice to see how democratic socialist states would work out, but we wont get that as long as the US intervenes in every state they seem geopolitically inconvenient.
t1_dur58fx	1	*	I like you
t1_duqssdv	0	*	Off topic. What's capitalism going to do when all of the jobs are replaced by superior automation?
t1_dutcgef	1	*	Is a country.
t1_duqtcfs	1	*	Dont use logic- it hurts their heads 
t1_durye08	1	*	Maybe that's the difference, I am 30.
t1_duqszh0	0	*	If that's the case why wouldn't it be considered a success as well if it's communism instead of capitalism?
t1_durtvop	1	*	Yes I know. That's why I said that the British having a massive Navy and the best muskets contributed to their technological superiority over the rebels in the Revolution. 
t1_dur2zqr	0	*	The very concept of poverty is relative.  So is the concept of income inequality.
t1_dur5u7f	0	*	Is it? Because I'm pretty sure in spite of America's best efforts, Cuba has one of the highest HDIs in the Caribbean.

t1_durjkym	1	*	Very interesting. Appreciate the response and the decorous debate. 
t1_dur1ke2	0	*	I think that account you're replying to is one that helps to troll politics on reddit to bait and stir up both sides.
t1_dur4d2p	0	*	Hahaha! Until the rain stops falling down and we get widespread drought and famines :/ hopefully that doesn't happen anytime soon.
t1_durijf8	1	*	That's what he's doing... :P

t1_dusxauh	1	*	See ya!
t1_dur7jce	1	*	Einstein disapproves. As does Reddit, apparently.
t1_duw9lgw	1	*	If it were anywhere near stable, they would not find the need to imprison so many non-violent dissenters.  Or ban their citizens from the world internet, which you are posting on now.
t1_dutbp17	0	*	Damn elitist much?
t1_dursho6	0	*	>Still, even in Somalia Tens of millions of people aren't being starved to death intentionally by a madman.  I'm confused how this relates to what we're talking about.

t1_durbykb	1	*	Well it's not utopia, nobody said it was, but the cogs are turning. It's a non-failure.  And it is a better place to live then it was before the revelution.

t1_dshzfls	1	*	So we agree to agree? What is problem?
t1_dsgqpdw	1	*	> The USSR eliminated homelessness while the US still struggles with this.  Do you know **how** they eliminated homelessness? Just as a tip - it wasn't egalitarian wealth distribution.
t1_dsfwree	0	*	Communism in the USSR worked so well that it crumbled under it's own weight. It definitely improved the lives of many in the short term, but it wasn't sustainable 
t1_dso4cbo	1	*	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holodomor  Stalin was a massmurdering psychopath that had no qualms with the murders of millions of his own countrymen if they did not get with the program.
t1_dsgfygc	1	*	No. Why would I say that?
t1_dsfgbiy	0	*	Yes it was worse in pretty much every single way. Give some good examples of how it was good? 
t1_dsg413y	1	*	When you don't identify yourself with any side of the conflict you describe, it's pretty easy to see things objectively. 
t1_dsfsvgj	0	*	>  On the good side of the wall this time.  I'm not triggered or insulted, I don't get what exactly you want say  good side of the wall is a very childish statement

t1_dsp0yhk	1	*	Jesus H. Fuck I cant even.

t1_dsov7hg	0	*	Haha, China is communist the same way Democrats are liberal. Its only relative to something else. China loves capitalism. 
t1_dsozpq8	0	*	To bad the red ones have grounded up lice in them... Ya know the red color itself? Lice. You're eating lice.
t1_dsv8lmp	1	*	I think the fact they are giving away more than 95% of their wealth means its about more things then taxes but go on keep living in your crazy space.

t1_due7v26	1	*	Explain to me why you would store a backup as a vm image that sounds ridiculously stupid and inefficient.
t1_dudvm06	1	*	There is no way to easily do that.    My question back to you is why are you storing my personal information for years in off-site backups if I don't want you to?
t1_dsktodn	0	*	How will they run all those dandy fishing boats when oil runs out?
t1_dsmbf00	0	*	We'll be the united states of Muslamia by then and talking about 'Englishness' will be outlawed.   You're already towing the line.

t1_dsl49dz	1	*	I have a motorcycle so that eases the burden of traffic since my job is  9 miles away.
t1_dskrfbt	0	*	So not all his policies are shit.   Maybe you should read into the people you critiscise further than just browsing reddit
t1_dskqh19	0	*	yeah but they aren't generally the guns you would use to assault people
t1_dskx6jt	1	*	The mayor working meaning sending a letter to Theresa May asking her to do something? I guess that is involved in a sense. 
t1_dskp964	0	*	He literally said some are good people. He did give them attention and it was positive. 
t1_dskugr0	0	*	THe fact that hes doing it based on Race makes him racist, though not like that was a new development
t1_dskr1t2	1	*	Less than 2 million.
t1_dskr7xl	0	*	So you're not going to answer my question then?  Anyway, you don't like Khan, that's your issue but don't twist my words to try and gain some support for your viewpoint.
t1_dskz4aq	1	*	They are both dumb 
t1_dsktjdz	0	*	What?
t1_dskpvqd	0	*	Yea it's almost like gun control doesn't really work when the person can literally just take a 10 minute car right a county over. It would have to implemented on much larger scale. 
t1_dskljxe	0	*	Or I could just think the entire movement is based on a handful of women who had regrets and wanted some media attention from decades-old allegations. 
t1_dskpvas	0	*	A LOT of the properties in the old area were investments owned by offshore companies and kept empty. It's not a densely populated area at all. And yhe new building is made of glass, no joke.
t1_dslqrle	1	*	And a police officer who shoots and kills anyone who panics or who they *imagine* is going for a gun isn't worth even less.
t1_dsknusp	0	*	There it is. 
t1_dskp67q	0	*	Maybe you are just unlikeable?
t1_dsl6iy1	0	*	Said everybody that didn't win this time around when they took no issue with it prior to the latest election.

t1_dskx6cp	0	*	The mayor working meaning sending a letter to Theresa May asking her to do something? I guess that is involved in a sense. 
t1_dskpnox	0	*	Everyone benefits from a healthy and educated populace. It's usually the ones that fall outside society's safety nets that have to turn to crime, so we want that to be strong too.
t1_dskq7e7	1	*	Tons of species can fly. Most birds, bats, and insects can (at some stage of their lives).
t1_dsl7mqc	0	*	So you're going to side with the one person who says no, rather than everyone else who says yes?  Ok.
t1_dskskp4	0	*	I've always wondered about the fact that many Norwegians settled in places like that when emigrating. Did they really love the climate in the old country that much..?
t1_dsl1bqq	1	*	Dont you mean read anything I write? To listen youd have to hear my voice.  Typical response in any case.

t1_dskp63o	1	*	Oh, that's fair
t1_dskpcps	0	*	HAhahaha you won't even be majority white in 30! your entire nation! ahahahahah
t1_dskq3os	0	*	Because people from my country can move freely to the UK and are not subjugated to any form of background check? 
t1_dsktdtq	0	*	Your country is imploding while ours is blooming but keep your head in the sand and cry more about Trump.
t1_dskody4	0	*	Agreed. Interesting to see whatll happen with them, being one of the last powerful unions in the country. The public are pretty tired of them. 
t1_dskpu5a	1	*	Fair enough.
t1_dskwmai	1	*	I dont give reddit gold as a matter of provincial... but you sir are a true and noble gentleman. 
t1_dskr01z	0	*	Alright, no rebuttal, just emotion. Got it.   Come back when you have something of substance to add instead of just personal attacks. 
t1_dskjskl	0	*	Except your own article shows the poll that has Trump and Obama at the same level. So you are lying, and edited in facts to cover up your lie while being unclear with the edit to try and smear me.
t1_dsl3i03	0	*	I meant around where I live they do still do worded it poorly.
t1_dskrl7j	0	*	so - you're starting to understand how the US democracy works? well done
t1_dslrs12	0	*	Dont feel bad for me. Just feel bad for your mother. 
t1_dskph9u	0	*	Yeah, because guns from the surrounding country are brought in. You know, the same way heroine is.
t1_dsktdd7	1	*	He's lying about the percentages too. 538 was more like 60-40.
t1_dskr7py	0	*	You're failing to see the difference between being Muslim and hurr durr he only cares about Muslims and brown people.
t1_dskx73p	0	*	Not sure if you know this but comments on Reddit are public, anyone can respond to them. Use a direct message if you don't want others to comment. 
t1_dsljedk	0	*	Ok no, Im suggesting you cannot invade the USA.  Youd be shot down a few miles from our airspace OR, shot down a few miles from shore.  Also, are you a terrorist?   Why do you hate the USA
t1_dskwgrm	0	*	Nope, you can pay whatever you want....just because your tax rate is 20% doesnt mean you cant pay 25%.   Ill stick with more money in my pocket
t1_dskr8l7	0	*	You really aren't good at debate here. Attacking me doesn't strengthen your statements. Just makes you look like you can't put forth a convincing argument. 
t1_dsnt5st	0	*	Basically  It also comes with those lips being blown up somehow, blonde hair, and the rest.   They all basically look like copies of the girl in the picture, super easy to spot.
t1_dtl64od	1	*	i think the order of run down jews in the street with your car is also collective punishment
t1_du9e7kq	1	*	Meanwhile [this guys](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/7xbhgw/israeli_police_say_prime_minister_benjamin/d4/?context=3) attempts to say resisting an oppressor is a form of genocide.
t1_du79gl0	0	*	We've seen very real results for the global war on terror as well. I just don't think its worth it.
t1_du7cna9	1	*	Cool. Bye.
t1_du7qftt	0	*	There were several massacres which made them flee en masse during a war. Do you support those Arab families the right to return then?
t1_du7l3tw	0	*	And how many Jews got their European property back after WWII? (the 1/3 who actually survived the war, 2/3 didnt really need it anymore)
t1_du7b8d3	0	*	That's where fake news comes in. Fake news is the vehicle by which you can disregard anything that run contrary to your worldview. 
t1_du7ey5q	0	*	But you dont have to agree to be enlightened, do you?   And I dont mean to sound cocky, just wondering if I get to finally say username checks out on reddit. 
t1_du7jwaw	0	*	They made a very compelling case 
t1_du7ebfc	0	*	He has denounced white supremacy several times. Youre wrong.   So, basically...a TL:DR of your post is He isnt doing anything hes not supposed to, just things I dont like.  Gotcha. 
t1_du7ota3	1	*	Hence why they turn to car bombs and terrorist attacks. People tend to do that when there are shells firing off over their school yards. Desperation is a powerful motivator.
t1_du7dr39	0	*	You are not the native people, the land was palestine pre-1948, and labelling is isreal post-1948 and having the US/RU acknowledge its existence, does not somehow make it your native land.

t1_du8lbb7	0	*	Unless you're gonna prove him wrong, just be quiet and let grown folk talk. No one wants to know what you think people should or should not say if you're not going to prove your argument.
t1_du7miov	0	*	What dude?  
t1_du7l8xy	1	*	Well if God wants me to fear him he should fuckin smite me.  - man smote, also /u/macderfus
t1_du7f84d	1	*	Explain away...enlighten me please
t1_du7m45a	1	*	Palestinians are culturally Arab, or 'arabised', but are mostly Levantine genetically. Bedouins are not ethnically Arab either.
t1_du7cmw2	0	*	You're speaking to a wall man, nothing will come out of what you say
t1_du7cza7	0	*	I never said there was a problem. You can pass all the laws you want and if someone wants to break them, they will find a way.
t1_du7sd33	0	*	Eh. The Palestinians almost had a state back when Barak was PM of Israel. The negotiations only ended because it was near the end of his term. 
t1_du7be6k	0	*	You would know about editing comments as you edited the previous one I responded to, right?  Are you?  Also, Im in the deep state? You sound like youre smoking...PCP...right...now...
t1_du7didu	0	*	IDF got you by the nuts.
t1_du8mfhr	0	*	Did you seriously just equate resistance against an oppressive government with genocide? That's a disgusting insult to the memory of every Jew who died during the Holocaust. 
t1_du7mi20	0	*	Deportation on what basis?
t1_du7row5	0	*	So the moral of the story is that you shouldn't bug god about all the minutia... because the devil is in the details?
t1_du93nh7	1	*	Im fine, youre the one thats misconstruing what I say and fails to grasp simple economic terms.
t1_du7bz8p	0	*	Sure. 
t1_du8k4ba	1	*	Sounds like someone read Sum of All Fears.
t1_du7m4b6	0	*	Then we should just undo all decisions the UN has made on the state of Israel including their right to exist.
t1_dugoifx	1	*	I am not, but it does not speak kindly for either side.
t1_du7l6za	1	*	indeed it is
t1_du7b6ro	1	*	If a person wants X, they are going to figure out a way to get X. Whether the reason is addiction or protection it doesn't really matter.
t1_du7z3q1	0	*	Dishonest rhetoric. You are pulling numbers out of your ass to create an argument. Who says Palestinians are trying to kill a hundred times more kids than Israelis do kill? No one. 
t1_dsew1qz	0	*	Damn, you really killed me there.
t1_dt5ppi3	0	*	Yeah but you still didn't tell me who created god.

t1_dsgbae2	0	*	Well as one Muslim, I would say that others need to hear all that, and maybe realize that their gay hatred is...modern(U0001f632).
t1_dsfsmsw	1	*	A sad state of affairs indeed.
t1_duycly3	0	*	> You think the US is the only one that has been doing that?  Put up some evidence or shut the fuck up, cunt.
t1_dt4v7et	0	*	Just take a traffic cop off the road and put them in schools. Better off saving lives than giving bull shit traffic violations. 
t1_ds91mht	1	*	That's just an artifact of people's irrationality and ignorance to the extent those issues don't matter.  But it is an artifact or defect we accept as a part of democracy.
t1_ds7vq09	1	*	Don't listen to him he's just mad he isn't one of us.
t1_ds809pt	0	*	> referendum   Sounds like a slow safer change than a revolution to me.

t1_dt4ul6p	0	*	Data is from 2015.
t1_dtlo8qk	1	*	People like thinking they're the best, they're good and everyone else isn't. It takes MORE effort to point a finger at yourself than it does to just point at someone else. 
t1_dsd6tqn	1	*	But what they pay me barely feeds me, much less a family of 4, health insurance, retirement, a house...
t1_dsd1nx9	0	*	> theft of surplus value  Get outta here with this communism bs
t1_dscz7h3	1	*	I thought there havent been much competition pop up because YouTube isnt that profitable? Might be mid-remembering that though so Im happy to be corrected 
t1_dseumib	1	*	Interesting. I've always had a bad memory but I feel like your whole post is something I wouldn't just be able to discuss off the top of my head, haha. High five.
t1_dsdbgoe	1	*	You misread it also...but you read it upside down so I forgive you  My mortgage is $340/month though in the UK :p  edit: no it seems I misread, missed the /s because you didn't add a space
t1_dsd6wfj	0	*	people gotta go hungry or else there won't be a new iPhone.
t1_dsf8nms	1	*	Oh, you misunderstood, I was talking about slaves, pointing out another major difference between them and Foxconn employees, further expanding your point in a joking manner
t1_dsd2bl7	1	*	Hey watch who youre getting licky with 
t1_dsdi1i5	0	*	You live in the reality where you can be a self righteous hypocrite and have no internal dissonance
t1_dsdfbvo	1	*	Solar roads will cover you!!1
t1_dsd6j1c	1	*	The thing is that YouTube is absolutely massive and stupidly expensive to run, the only reason it exists is because Google has the money to run it. It would be way worse.on any other company
t1_dsd1qqo	1	*	Get your tongues ready, everyone
t1_dsd4vdm	1	*	Taiwan's general wage problem aside, they probably get paid quite well relative to the norm here.

t1_duyll4e	1	*	lol enjoy thinking about dicks I guess.
t1_duz07xe	0	*	Hey that's fine, I'm all for tax frauds like manafort being expelled. Just don't try to equate it to something it's not. 
t1_duythsi	1	*	This investigation  is just more proof the investigation is over and they are just hanging on to it to make millions more dollars for their greedy corrupt asses.
t1_duz7ax8	0	*	/u/WinJillSteinsMoney is a Troll. report and move on. 
t1_duyqssy	0	*	People who drink the propaganda kool aid. What are you to do if he get's re-elected? Sure I was condescending but it was a serious question.
t1_duz95n0	1	*	He started guantanamo
t1_duz34bd	1	*	everyone has their faults and there was many more people who wanted us to invade then just bush, bush didnt say, hey you defense secretary, ready the drones, **we're going hunting**
t1_duylqme	0	*	You understand his sentence lol 
t1_dv02e4f	0	*	Sorry for the delay, I actually posted this hours ago bit accidentally in the wrong argument. My bad.  https://youtu.be/Mehb5sqKyrI 
t1_duypm9f	1	*	I'm not, I can't even see the score yet. 
t1_duzm4f1	1	*	Seriously drives me nuts people talk about him like hes a good guy in these threads. He was more eloquent and rational than Trump but hes still objectively one of the worst human beings on the planet.
t1_duz8ass	1	*	Cool, thank you for the link.  EDIT: Not cool that they did it, but I do appreciate you sourcing it.
t1_duzseo1	1	*	Nah no problem, I'm the same way sometimes. Just in that mood to hear myself interject tonight apparently. Have a good one!
t1_duzhubc	1	*	you are probably right but at the same time it would be a hard thing to walk away from. i mean, if the US presidency was pretty much handed to you, would you be able to turn it down?
t1_duywni3	1	*	Its not a run on, but claim and both should be switched around to make it flow better.
t1_duyus9f	1	*	Ignoring their opinions doesn't stop them from voting. We can't ignore their votes...
t1_duyjsii	0	*	Youre definitely offended because youre Russian.      ,     ?
t1_duz3byn	0	*	*Crickets
t1_duyte5e	1	*	I hear you, the lack of good discourse and heavy dosage of propaganda from all sides has led to a general disinterest here as well.
t1_duz05y9	0	*	It's an honest question. There's evidence but No one cares.    What has trump done that is shady, exactly? Can you point to one?
t1_duz3hd9	0	*	I'm not saying he does or doesn't have dementia.   But if he *does* have it, then he's doing an incredible job of covering it up. 
t1_duyqnt3	0	*	Searching someone's comment history does nothing to discredit their current argument. It doesn't strengthen your weak argument either. Just makes you look childish, honestly. 
t1_duymn4k	0	*	And that fact that there are so many silent people out there speaks volumes on your nation's intelligence as a whole.
t1_duym1ln	0	*	What's worse:  the inside or outside of a used condom?  That's what you're trying to decide to put into your mouth when pledging loyalty to one party or the other. 
t1_dv0wu18	1	*	Guess no tangible negative changes. Keep on roleplaying your oppresion.
t1_duyzvue	0	*	You said word count, its character count.   Youre trying to weasel out of a completely black & white issue. 
t1_duzsw8e	1	*	Barack Obama manages. So does Hillary Clinton. Bernie Sanders. Ted Lieu. 
t1_duzt6qa	1	*	The second one, obviously. Why would I talk about the Schiff memo?
t1_duyywuq	0	*	I'm not spending minutes watching a video to understand your point. To even assume I would is rude.
t1_duyo0m4	1	*	How do our allies feel when Trump didnt make the routine affirmation of the NATO commitment that an attack on one of us is an attack on all of us? 
t1_duz5lq8	0	*	Keep at it keyboard warrior.  You're making quite the difference...  I heard you may even be up for the baby dick of the month award for February.  Congrats.
t1_duymh8z	0	*	Today yes. Might not be the same in another 20 years. 
t1_duyysah	0	*	You dont know what Citizens United is? Well, sir, youre going to find out. Bernie 2020. 
t1_duyokm2	1	*	Right. The only way to disprove my argument is to show the FISA app. 
t1_duyuu5x	0	*	This is all common knowledge, Maybe you've been watching too much Alex Jones 
t1_duz0aw7	1	*	I have no clue if something theoretical exists or not, by definition. I'm saying no one has offered any proof that it does exist. The burden is on those claiming it exists. 
t1_duzsld7	0	*	I know US citizens who crossed state lines to vote multiple times. Your system is shit.
t1_duz6ts9	1	*	The only thing that makes me think Trump wouldn't get state charges is because he's rich and, as we know, laws don't apply to those people.
t1_duypq0i	0	*	That is a *really* tough call for me, as a card-carrying liberal Democrat.  Edit: I think it really depends on how right Mueller is on social issues, which hold more weight for me. 
t1_duytqh1	0	*	Regardless of weather or not you think it made a difference, to say you don't think that any illegal aliens voted for Hillary in California is incredibly ignorant. 
t1_duzqqi4	0	*	Wait, didnt you just say that he was fired for being to hard on Hillary? So which is it?
t1_duzg8nr	1	*	Yea he knows that but hes a fucking idiot and he ignores it.  
t1_duyj85t	0	*	You are trying really hard to to ignore the question.  > Why are you so offended? Are you Russian?
t1_duzj5jx	1	*	Then the best solution is to make sure infected goat brain isn't on the Democratic Ticket.
t1_dv0vz5w	0	*	Batting a thousand I see.
t1_dv1j7jx	0	*	listen again. a fooled man can't get fooled again 
t1_duykqwz	0	*	Plenty came forward later bub. Stay under your rock though.
t1_duyl6tb	1	*	Not an argument
t1_duyzrqn	1	*	Cause I got a little notification and its not like replying to you requires much effort on my part. 
t1_duyqb6c	1	*	It's Putin's go to misdirect, of course that's how they'd respond. 
t1_dv0z0xl	0	*	Yup, like the rest of the non-American democratic world, I believe that all humans have a right to health care and the state has a duty to provide it.  Weird and radical huh?  
t1_duyuwu3	1	*	I didn't downvote you at all. And I'm still not sure if you were being sarcastic or not when you said you liked that quote. Either way is fine, I'm just still kinda confused.
t1_duz6y3b	0	*	see above statements for refutation
t1_dv01div	0	*	we're still threatening to sanction Turkey even without the sanctions on Russia, they are seperate
t1_dsyhu6m	1	*	Yeah that was weird

t1_dsyp1tk	0	*	> a diagnosis [..] would take months   .    > Gamble, who is now 18
t1_dsyedkj	1	*	Well ***I*** have a long and detailed theory of the accounting practices used in the film *Blank Check* and let me tell you
t1_dsyei0l	0	*	I haven't actually. So yeah, I made some assumptions about the plot. My bad.
t1_dsynm08	1	*	How bout dat 686 with an AI chip?
t1_dt0stv4	1	*	But look at all the fancy words! :)
t1_dsytfp2	1	*	Season 3 just ended. So season 4 probably August or September of this year.
t1_dsza2lf	1	*	Thank you!  I'm really glad I asked.  I wish your post wasn't buried so deep so others could also enjoy it.
t1_dsxvjd9	0	*	Where did I mention anything about being clever?  >Why are you so upset that I'm merely pointing out that you hate us?  Except we don't hate you and you've not provided any evidence for that....   
t1_dt1kn9p	0	*	Lol. Okay. Sorry you're so misinformed and it seems very angry at the world. Even your name screams I hate my parents. 
t1_ds61h0d	1	*	I agree, they are occupying native American lands, wait you thought I was American? 
t1_ds63l2q	0	*	I agree, I also believe foreigners shouldn't just come into your land, kill you and take it for them selves, then play the victim if you dare fight back
t1_ds6nwoc	1	*	Jesus Christ go annoy someone else, like what do you expect to gain from this?   Don't answer that, it was rhetorical.
t1_ds61jny	1	*	In Palestine jews were a minority, the huge bulk came in after the invasion happened   And why is it Palestinians problem that the world hates jews?
t1_dtxawf4	0	*	Thank you for giving a law nerd a chance to nerd out!
t1_dtxb5st	1	*	Holy shit I hope his is true. 
t1_dtxlzw5	0	*	Thats a fancy wankers Ute sure. 
t1_dtxcpcl	1	*	God that's brilliant 
t1_dtxsz3d	0	*	No.  I think they are both vile.  But keep *projecting*.
t1_dtxej8y	0	*	Only when it pertains to politics.  You wouldn't be thrilled if you scored 60% on an academic test.
t1_du8w4mn	1	*	> a build up of forces is not an act of war, just an act of diplomacy.  Strange approach to diplomacy...
t1_du9f71u	1	*	Only several km off the coast.   
t1_du9lv7o	0	*	Sorry, since you somehow don't seem to get it:  What happened 3000 years ago isn't relevant.
t1_du9g8l6	1	*	As does Israel.   But S Korea doesn't let Noth Koreans over who are armed with explosives
t1_du99opn	1	*	Your logic is bad and you should feel bad.
t1_du94qge	0	*	I don't know what you meant.  The border with Egypt is a land border
t1_du95c4k	0	*	the one who makes the claim typically has a burden of proof to justify or substantiate that claim  two people can make claims at the same time.   
t1_du93nnz	0	*	[This ](http://www.un.org/depts/los/LEGISLATIONANDTREATIES/STATEFILES/ISR.htm)  should help. Youre getting closer but you are still incorrect. 
t1_duihi1f	1	*	how long do you think he'll go on before he breaks and tries to pass it off as trolling
t1_dui5df6	0	*	That's why I said we SHOULD end them.
t1_dv5la3p	1	*	Good looks. Its been fun. :) best of luck to you.
t1_dv5aazx	1	*	Good effort, man. Good effort. 
t1_dv4waqp	1	*	Maybe you should clean off the shit then.
t1_dv5f3gv	0	*	Oh I am so sorry. Really this is all my fault. I should have known better than to engage you with a response. Next time I will be more mindful of that.
t1_dv5j0qf	1	*	Keep doing your thing man. Thanks for keeping us safe.
t1_dv4x5hv	0	*	The majority of top posts consist of trolling posts or shitty memes. The top comments are usually worse.  Edit: Looking at your posts, it looks like you should know that by now.
t1_dv5a318	1	*	That's the root of the problem right there. A non living entity has been given more rights then a fellow human being.
t1_dv55iod	0	*	I was speaking more to an Alford Plea, or No Contest (nolo contendere)
t1_dv578wf	1	*	I was trying to show you a video of Trey Gowdy's mouth moving, with those words coming out of it. I guess he could be a russian bot though.
t1_dv5d20v	0	*	What is first past the post? 
t1_dv5b6gq	0	*	If you use the more recent words then it's easier to find information and share ideas.  The other poster is agreeing with you and also trying to tell you stuff.  
t1_dv5056h	0	*	Come on bro thats super lame. So people who disagree with you politically are bots? Thats super low of you Im just saying lol.
t1_dv5ihk5	1	*	Yeah, agreed.  Im not sure why my post is down-voted. Thats literally exactly what all conservative media calls out republicans for. That was why they had to call a truce with pre-Fire & Fury Bannon.
t1_dv58y8u	0	*	Either that, or one day mad dog Mattis and John Kelly beat them all to death. Marines have high standards, there is only so much they will take before they snap. 
t1_dv564ll	1	*	Notoriously goffy acting too.
t1_dv54toh	0	*	Different ways of saying the same thing yes. But knowing the right key words makes finding academic papers and studies a lot easier.
t1_dv4w0gn	0	*	Maybe some of the commenters but the posts are literally just the headlines of news articles. R/t_d has posts with headlines that are borderline psychotic. 
t1_du18rhv	0	*	Did Muslims go out and vote for their terrorists like you went out and voted for a racist platform after one of you shot Jo Cox dead in the street?
t1_dtzkjgm	0	*	> and better long term after brexit   Literally - and I do mean *literally* - nobody worth their salt is predicting this. No-one.   Brexit is a game of Catch-up-to-ourselves-Pre-Brexit. 
t1_dsfm2g5	0	*	Stock market and unemployment simply continued on the same trajectory they had under Obama.   It's funny that you'd even think the stock market is a sign of the average man doing well. It isn't.
t1_dsfdkff	0	*	If Breitbart is not far right can you show us an article that you would use to prove that?  Ed: I'll take your downvote as a No.
t1_dsh5ku2	1	*	I get the point but disagree with it.
t1_dsfdzy5	0	*	The media isnt the president 
t1_dsfon8i	0	*	Except I did and there's no explanation.  Which brings us back to you.  You also shouldn't need a different website to justify your own position.  You should be able to validate your own opinion.  
t1_dsfdxql	1	*	I never called myself a warrior. You are projecting my friend.
t1_dsq7hla	0	*	Um what?
t1_dt4os9y	0	*	I doesn't have to be leaked. Trump can declassify it, and either committee can declassify it. Republicans.
t1_dv3av61	0	*	lol yeah i figured youd drop out about there 
t1_dv4f4us	1	*	You are the cause of the fracture, if you are even American, read what you just posted
t1_dtg0fxo	1	*	Yeah, that's fair.    Indeed, our educational system in the US is practically designed to get people to follow the crowd.  Then we are surprised when two huge crowds form and hate each other.
t1_dtfdg8k	1	*	That is a *very* narrow line you are trying to draw.
t1_dtewhq0	0	*	Definitely, I think we are all more biased and tribal than we would like to believe.
t1_dtfm8hs	0	*	It was a school civics lesson with a mock vote. I'd be a prodigy indeed if the poll watchers couldn't figure out I wasn't qualified...
t1_dtfm5dy	1	*	Reference to [this scene](https://youtu.be/hdZXlMl1xG4) from Prometheus  (Oh god, the uploader added music)
t1_dtfyh9b	0	*	mock elections in elementary school is a rather common thing. I recall the 1992 and 1996 elections both had mock elections at my elementary.
t1_ds3fv8f	0	*	Well, the article which I linked from 2013 says people were getting the official exchange rate in the US back then.
t1_dty60f2	1	*	Okay great, what sources do you want that you won't brush off as propaganda? 
t1_du1eybo	0	*	haha... And I will assume you're not Xi so you have zero influence on whether China would invade Taiwan or not despite your wishes. The only thing you can do is day dreaming on the internet. 
t1_duvotgg	0	*	This is interesting. Can you provide some links for further reading? 
t1_dtbvzyc	1	*	Mate you are overestimating Russia's importance. China, India and Iran are all far more relevant to the US than that broken kleptocracy that was used to be called Russia. 
t1_dugkc8r	1	*	That's a weird thing to say in a thread about a German diplomat insulting me.
t1_dugj1qq	0	*	> the only one who's acting overdramatic and contemptuous here is you.  We no longer recognize our America
t1_dugi5cv	0	*	We no longer recognize our America  It's like a line from theater. You can almost see the pose he makes when he delivers it so the rubes at the back can tell how dramatic it is.
t1_dugxsk4	1	*	Yeah, what I'm saying is Japan was ready to surrender after the first bomb. America still dropped the second one.
t1_dtqmyfg	0	*	What show is that? I want to watch it while I drink beer.
t1_ds8bvjx	0	*	And the russians offered the US usage of their southern bases after 9/11, does that mean they're allies?
t1_ds8bprx	0	*	I think this Steve person is in denial.
t1_ds90cdu	1	*	Totally bullshit, even if that agreement was in effect it doesn't give any permission for settling. 
t1_ds8df5l	0	*	Get a dictionary.
t1_dsp6zjj	0	*	That's not that fast
t1_dspe78s	0	*	Oops. 
t1_dsowwb4	0	*	I'm just asking if China was considered a real power at the time of the Korean War. 
t1_dsplnzq	1	*	Cool. Got anything that says 10M plus?
t1_dsp3s8a	0	*	And an even bigger threat would be meteors that are slightly larger than the previous one! Now we're in for it
t1_dspgmg5	1	*	Bigger if truer. 
t1_dsouzg7	0	*	Russia will use thermonuclear weapons to induce the Yellowstone to erupt
t1_dsp56ik	1	*	Next time I'll make sure to invest and hodl hard on Bitcoin
t1_dsp17a7	0	*	I thought current satellites had resolution in the order of meters. Wouldn't they be able to find a carrier relatively easily as long as the computation time exists to process all the images? 
t1_dst5chm	1	*	I'll be sure to look up some Tolle and Cease and see what it's all about - thanks my dude. 
t1_dsp29ey	0	*	You could have one of these parked in a harbor for a very long time in sleep mode and nobody could know it was there.

t1_dsplp07	1	*	I do!  It's why people would *leave the area.*

t1_dsp25fq	1	*	After Tet, the Vietnam war became a largely conventional war.
t1_dsoyiel	0	*	Yes
t1_dspnabc	1	*	Insofar as the Cold War was WW3... yes.  
t1_dspcggd	0	*	I was going by the notion some studies claim that 100 nukes would make Earth uninhabitable.
t1_dsp1ooq	1	*	Oh, possibly. I know I heard it from someone, maybe that's what they were talking about.   Oh well, glad that the correct info is in the thread now. 
t1_dspgwtc	1	*	well it would be mostly inert if it weren't for the fact there was plenty of energy from a nuclear explosion xD
t1_dsrcgd5	0	*	Women sense my power..  But I deny it to them!
t1_dsovpaf	1	*	Now that you mention it, no! They all suck! 
t1_dsp4vqw	1	*	I miss the internet.
t1_dsq9apc	1	*	We have all seen what happens when you try to evacuate for a hurricane. Any road leading out of the north east would be a disaster and would take weeks to clear. 
t1_dsph24k	0	*	Oops, corrected. Dunno why in my mind it was a 57-58 movie, maybe the B&W, didn't check on mobile earlier.
t1_dspawrj	0	*	Gentlemen there is to be no fighting in the war room!
t1_dspn7zw	1	*	Shouldn't the fallout be going in the other direction due to the jet streams?

t1_dsqbk0g	1	*	Agreed
t1_dspk2lc	1	*	Have you seen it also?
t1_dsp0rrx	0	*	Wasn't it later dubbed a Total War scenario?
t1_dspzubu	1	*	Yeah I think it's a special few idiots who do not believe in climate change - it's just that some don't agree that it's the Armageddon that news headlines make it out to be.
t1_dspp6td	1	*	Well, somebody else might not know.
t1_dsp5yag	0	*	Ah ok. India potentially pulling out is a big deal. I imagine their purchases were intended to help keep the program afloat.
t1_dspp09p	0	*	Source on that claim?
t1_dtu5h44	0	*	Your pedestal is actually a coupler that connects the payload (car) to the last stage.  When the payload is ejected, the coupler and payload will separate 
t1_dsrqt4s	0	*	On that we can agree.  Not dedending every action he takes, but a conflict has been brewin for decades and he is pressuring NK to stop before military action is necessary.

t1_dss6umd	1	*	Never have there been words more clear to come from someone who has no clue what they are talking about.
t1_dsrnu02	0	*	Ok so you count everybody who died under Queen Victoria as a victim of capitalism then, right? 
t1_dsry0pm	0	*	Pretty ironic since your last comment was almost entirely wut about muh red hats?
t1_dsu0pjj	1	*	I respect you for explaining your thought process.
t1_dsrsvt4	0	*	People diagnosing other people with mental illnesses on the internet is so fucking cringy.
t1_dsspj91	0	*	By not ignoring it and saying Oh yeah?! My nuclear button is bigger!!. Now suddenly NK is a threat worth addressing because the US is acting like they're a threat to the world. 
t1_dssb8we	1	*	No worries, we all make mistakes!
t1_dsry0a0	1	*	I did read the article. If you really believe that all we know about the horrors of North Korea comes from the anecdotes of two defectors I don't know where you've been the last 20 years.

t1_dsroqzm	0	*	Whats the book called? And why isnt Hoover in that list? Or Jackson who started the trail of tears? Or Nixon? Makes no sense
t1_dssaooc	0	*	Yeah, no shit. That's my point exactly. Everyone running around talking about this stuff like it's the end of the world is just fear mongering. 
t1_dsrojuu	0	*	That is a best case scenario.

t1_dstc4nu	0	*	No actually, you're an idiot. seriously stop wasting my time .
t1_dsrp1qd	0	*	America didn't invade anywhere, it was North Korea that invaded the South. Learn some history before you start spouting random shit.
t1_dsrnxyy	1	*	You can click on All if you dare. The post is in r/funny which I'm not subbed to either. 
t1_dsrpoon	0	*	A popular opinion is in fact an opinion and I am allowed to disagree with it do you have an actual argument against my opinion or do you just feel like assuming my motives and mindset for me?
t1_dsrwoso	0	*	youre just wasting my time at this point. Im not going to contribute to your made up fantasy, sorry.
t1_dsro0b8	1	*	^Like^^that^^^maybe
t1_dsroznh	0	*	You're literally spouting north korean propaganda.    The general public is leaps and bounds more sane than you are.
t1_dss43sf	0	*	Yeah let me ask my daddy for a couple million and then invest it poorly 
t1_dsrtqr1	1	*	No worries, it happens. Ill edit the parent post with a disclaimer that this thread was a misunderstanding that has since been resolved.
t1_dsl79uo	1	*	What total nonsense.
t1_dslti4o	1	*	Thank you. What a nice thing to say. One can only hope, I suppose.
t1_dsl6ll2	1	*	Should is not will, nor must
t1_dslfvnx	0	*	Safe spaces are a leftist thing. 
t1_dslc1yj	0	*	Is there a site or something that shows all of these? Otherwise I'm just gonna go through and try them all myself later and I'm too lazy for that.
t1_dsl2y5z	1	*	Accusations are their only form of argument. They just fail to see the pitfalls in psychological projection. 
t1_dslc6s6	0	*	I thought Alt+F4 was how to win games online? 
t1_dsl6rcg	1	*	Seriously.  This guy needs Rosetta Stone for - what is probably - his native language.

t1_dsli88z	0	*	For the record I didnt vote.    Fuck you too then. 
t1_dsla5wx	1	*	You're both guilty and you don't know me to deflect generalizations is ridiculous when you just finished generalizing trump supporters.
t1_dslgcly	1	*	Once he's finished his tour through Europe and Australia he'll be 74. If he decides to do South America that will go to 2019. And then to kick off another tour would be about another year after. 
t1_dslbx8j	1	*	Ehhh, this one seems pretty justified 
t1_dsldqrl	0	*	How is the DoD being the largest employer with the  Highest average salary not relevant to their budget?  Do you believe peace is possible if we didn't have a large military force?
t1_dsn4tze	0	*	Hahaha. Dumb people like you are the reason your party lost. 
t1_dsl2zdg	1	*	It's Friday so if all goes well I won't know my own name by the end of the night.  
t1_dslzswd	1	*	Youre a genius
t1_dskznhb	0	*	I grew up in a predominately immigrant community. That's probably a significant contributing factor.

t1_dsl9nhk	0	*	I have no fucking reasons to delete any of my comments besides the one that wasn't directed to you
t1_dslhky2	1	*	I'm pretty sure Alt+F4 gives a speed boost to the choppers in BF2. At least, that's what I used to tell everyone.
t1_dsl8btk	0	*	Just read what he's saying. You know damn well Obama helped fucked them over. It doesn't fit your agenda so you dismiss it. The truth is right there, plain to see. 
t1_dslao21	1	*	I didn't say anything of the sort. I was making a joke.
t1_dspnrwd	0	*	 How do you think it feels to be told you were only hired because of the color of your skin?
t1_dslchwd	1	*	As the owner of a casino, you are in the gambling business. Even as a real estate investment, they were a poor choice. They were too close together. So, unless you have some actual point to argue...
t1_dsl0flx	0	*	I was refuting his claims. The burden of proof lies with him, patriot.
t1_dslc290	0	*	>hahahaha  Who's the lunatic?
t1_dsl7owr	1	*	Alas, quite the opposite; my country is run as ineffectively as possible and that's (partially) why it's fucked.
t1_dsl41qx	1	*	Yeah I agree with you there. In fact it might allow it to get much worse unfortunately 
t1_dslc843	0	*	>I can't wait to piss on the ashes of the Democratic Party  >I'm not governed by fee fees  Uh huh. Sure you aren't.

t1_dslmn0b	1	*	Don't worry mate, I'm doing absolutely fine. Thank you for your concerns though I appreciate it.
t1_dsl4iqp	1	*	I believe it. You don't learn 0 from daddy paying  $ ???,??? for your schooling. 
t1_dsl1x7u	1	*	Using the right word is important too. The idea you were trying to convey would not have been unintuitive if you had.
t1_dsl38zt	1	*	In what way?
t1_dsld3st	1	*	Fair enough, I guess I can only say for a fact that the majority of Voters did not elect him, and it is my opinion that non-voters' opinions on politics are irrelevant.
t1_dskz93g	0	*	Ok... I'm completely lost at this point. 
t1_dsl6f4x	1	*	> imaginary math  Alternative math, seriously, atleast try to listen to them sometimes!
t1_dslfb4a	0	*	Literally almost every opinion you have is incorrect, so take your pick.  Where to start? That calling a country shitty is racist? That's one and done.
t1_dsmm0xm	1	*	Thanks!  I will keep doing me.  Have a great day.  
t1_dslcw6f	0	*	No one is blatantly calling people names though? Pointing out various reasons why a person is lying, racist, illogical, etc isnt being mean for means sake.
t1_dskz2wq	0	*	It's pretty hilarious to assume that the financial obligations of a country are the exact same as a family paying a credit card. That's such an over-simplistic and wrong way of how it is.  
t1_dsl8la3	1	*	Real estate including planning and managing and running casinos. 
t1_dsl4723	1	*	Nah Kim knows that as soon as extinction balls start flying, his time is way more up than anyone else's. He doesn't want shit to fly, he wants to be left alone to torture his citizens.
t1_dslkxwv	0	*	I will have to give that a read... but I do know that the drug companies lied to M.D.s that if used as directed Oxycontin was safe. And there are a bunch of federal and state lawsuits on the way
t1_dsl9hx8	1	*	**Exactly**

t1_ds9jqx7	0	*	That's on them.  If they don't enjoy it, go run one that they do enjoy.  Getting rich shouldn't be the primary motivation in doing anything.
t1_ds9v1wv	1	*	In some time lines it goes on forever!
t1_dsa0nhw	1	*	I understood this reference FeelsBadMan
t1_dsa56jd	1	*	Lol I know this better than you think. But those fixes are basic shit for any company of a decent size.

t1_dtzq4j9	1	*	Got'm!
t1_dstpy67	0	*	Bro its a reddit comment. This isnt the supreme court.  There is literally nothing I could say that would change your mind. You literally log on just to argue and be a dick.
t1_dssq3s8	1	*	That was like watching an axe grind to the butt. Good on ya.
t1_dsn2irc	1	*	I have a pretty long reading list at the moment but i suppose it something to consider.
t1_dsmacrs	1	*	And?
t1_dsm8ltg	0	*	Because he fucking protested to being ripped in two.   And the research doesn't say that- the research is inconclusive.  
t1_dsmmjs4	1	*	Yes. 
t1_dsm3p52	1	*	20 years in the restaurant business. I've seen some shit, man. I've seen some shit.
t1_dsmgcjt	0	*	There is a difference in communicating signals and communcating emotions. A plant can communicate that there are bugs currently nibbling it but it cant communicate that theyre sad because its cloudy.
t1_dslv7kc	1	*	You can't even pretend to be able to feel the same thing as a lobster when a lobster's *ability* to feel is in question.
t1_dsmnd4y	0	*	What the fuck? I'm pretty sure if people ate only eggs they'd have some real problems too. I'm not saying only eat rice and beans, just like they weren't saying only eat eggs. 
t1_dsmbiht	0	*	Not remotely an analogy.  Keep trying maybe one day you'll grow a brain cell.
t1_dsmi0ky	1	*	How bout them sources, big guy?
t1_dsm9sat	0	*	No reason why you can't kill it right before it goes into the pan. The meat will be just as fresh.
t1_dsmftqd	1	*	I've seen bugs poisoned by insecticide take time to die.
t1_dsm9afd	0	*	Nothing in this article indicate that plants are aware of this anymore than i am aware of the bacteria my immune system are surely currently fighting.

t1_dsls3v7	0	*	Why?
t1_dsmejcr	0	*	That's the point though. Neither one is really instant.
t1_dso9sh8	0	*	Youre embarrassing yourself. 
t1_dsm9uyu	0	*	Not a lobster expert but Ive read the reason its boiled alive is to make the finished product look more visually appealing 
t1_dur3uxm	0	*	Ohhh, bold, Welp, I'm convinced.  >I discussed   You keep using that word, I do not think it means what you think it means.
t1_dup7yl2	0	*	I'll wait until you get to the part where you turn thought into action, though, before committing or condoning violence inflicted upon you. I don't believe in thought crime, unlike you.
t1_dupqjlw	0	*	TIL 100% of US Republicans and 90% of US Democrats are a Nazi in the eyes of AntiFa
t1_dup7to1	1	*	Imagine living in such a bubble that you think the only political ideology to ever use violence is fascism and that all forms of political violence were created equal.
t1_dup7w9b	0	*	And you take advice from Hitler.
t1_dup8f6x	0	*	Maybe you should educate yourself on the exact definitions of right wing and left wing before you act snarky to people. Stalin was widely known as a LEFT wing extremist. 
t1_duq2vgn	1	*	Fascism requires power over a group or individual. If youre being oppressed/killed you can strike back.
t1_dupjh0v	1	*	Thanks. Exactly.
t1_dup7uxf	0	*	Nope, I'm calling you a fascist because you condone, endorse, and will probably commit fascist acts someday. 
t1_duq0fte	0	*	So it wasn't the fascism? Seems fighting a war overseas and later rebuilding the region is the opposite of nationalism. Hitler was deff a nationalist though, ironically enough.
t1_dupz9uu	0	*	Are you a racist, know-nothing, useful idiot to the wealthy interests that are controlling you?
t1_dup1qgy	0	*	Try addressing what I say like an adult. :)
t1_dupqacj	0	*	So you're not against fascism? If you're not a fan of liberal democracy there's a few countries I could suggest for you.
t1_dsanwb4	1	*	The main problem with the chinese system, is that it encourages you to distance yourself from those who disagree with the government. That doesn't happen in America.
t1_dujxpf3	0	*	Your prime minister gets all weepy when a monster like Castro dies. You do not get to take the moral high ground here
t1_dtyxdjm	1	*	You can't.   They want Jerry Springer Drama  not education, information, science, actionable policy, reliable infrstructure, trust in invested experts, etc.  Spectacle, action, and noise  not signal.
t1_du05leb	0	*	That is the plan.
t1_du0g8ym	0	*	I'm not a fan of handing out citizenship to criminals or taxing success so no thank you.
t1_dtman9f	1	*	Obama didn't start more wars than Bush...
t1_dszryu8	1	*	Fair enough. I think we can all agree that the movement isn't entirely ineffectual. That's what I saw the demonstration was about.
t1_dtojzoa	1	*	Im glad you got that out of your system. 
t1_dupr13o	0	*	So in your opinion, who are the superior race(s)?

t1_duq9hjr	0	*	>regardless of geographic location  > Africa IS the only place like this.   ?
t1_dt06v2z	0	*	It is, however, true.  A terror attack isn't determined by the method, but the target.  For instance, Kamakazi Attacks were not terror attacks.
t1_dszwdet	0	*	lets give the Americans their tiny bit of the East Coast and leave the rest for the Natives Americans
t1_dt069cr	1	*	yeah and america shouls be reduced to thirteen colonies, prior to the rise of usa. But I guess it makes a lot more sense when it comes to turks.
t1_dulx1kn	0	*	Lol wrong decade my friend
t1_dulnoay	0	*	You're just being obtuse
t1_dum7z2j	1	*	Look at The Holodomor The Great Leap Forward Tiananman Square etc...
t1_dumrjz4	1	*	Not the modern ones, those even turn everybody they kill into combatants. You are sitting in your house as a normal civilian, a missile hits the house and suddenly you are a dead combatant.
t1_dulpkyw	0	*	Democratic primaries are not run by the US govt, but by the DNC. They follow their own set of rules
t1_duljizu	0	*	A war is defined as lasting more than 1 month?  Did not know that.
t1_dumgf1h	1	*	>If one is fighting a war, however one got there, is there any rational reason to fight it in a way that puts your peoples' lives at greater risk than is necessary?  No, hence use of drones.
t1_dulojg4	1	*	No SA is a brutal authoritarian regime that starves people in a neighbouring country and is regularly bombing it because of their differing religious beliefs...  Yep, that's waaay better.
t1_dulyf2k	1	*	We had that mentality since before USSR existed. Look at Latin America.
t1_dum2mtr	0	*	Uuuuuhhhhh what?
t1_dulyh3k	0	*	Clearly your parents people did not have anything to do with it.
t1_dum9vmw	0	*	So you want your own country to become irrelevant and internationally neglected? Thats an odd desire.
t1_dum73xq	1	*	And were gassed
t1_dultsjk	0	*	Yeah, but the US didn't fight in the Sino-Vietnamese war, which china lost.
t1_dumnohn	1	*	[Exhaustive list, with US companies.](https://www.sec.gov/spotlight/fcpa/fcpa-cases.shtml)
t1_dumddy6	1	*	Never thought it would be. Thats why I specified the period of time after his election when the dems had the majority in the house and senate. Itd be easier to push that legislation through. 
t1_dunr5aw	0	*	No, as Norwegian I believe I have some say on the matter, actually. Obama got the prize as a symbol for overcoming slavery, basically. A point that was completely lost on most of you, apparently.
t1_dum80m0	0	*	Go ahead an cherry pick to your delight without referencing ANY OTHER PART of this looooong article. We're done here, you're just another troll.
t1_dum9oiv	1	*	Shit even animals generally have a us first mentality.
t1_dun07sz	0	*	I'm not sure what kind of news you're reading or where you get information from but you can use VPN in China.  Pretty much everything you say is pretty dumb...
t1_dum5k0o	0	*	> Its makes me sad to think about what my parents country could have been if not for U.S. imperialist greed.   Just another communist country ruled by the Kremlin?  
t1_dumqkw1	0	*	Oh every country has a gargatuan national security complex and intelligence organization like the CIA?
t1_dumbq5m	1	*	Well. All that for a war they lost...

t1_dum0ffb	0	*	British imperialist greed. The Brits asked us to step in to help with their oil situation. 
t1_dulo1yt	1	*	They're a brutal authoritarian regime for all Philippino and Indian guest workers, though, and they're bombing and starving the Yemeni people to death.  
t1_dulxmah	0	*	.....That was a legitimate question, ain't no baiting from me.
t1_dumoce0	0	*	But the actual benefits of his foreign policies are still not fully ripe yet. We will see in coming years. It might be ripe in Russia's garden though.
t1_dslaeif	0	*	Citing statistics is not prejudice... It's fact. Im sorry, but thats another level of stupid.  > prejudice -  preconceived opinion that is not based on reason or actual experience.  
t1_dt6njvu	0	*	Nah. I own land here. Fuck off. Its my society. I pay my taxes and vote for smaller govt. We are keeping Pennsylvania red.
t1_dt8h44k	0	*	Puerto Rico has never had an official vote authorized by the the USA federal congress. They have had several meaningless votes, that almost nobody participated in because the vote was meaningless. 
t1_dt71l5n	1	*	LOL uhhh uhhh uhhh uhhh RACCCIIIIISSTTT lol. Dude, your too unintelligent to have a debate please stop.

t1_dua6ck1	0	*	Assault rifles are fun to shoot though.
t1_duc414t	1	*	Im not saying getting a gun is easy... Im saying the idea of needing to break additional laws is a low barrier of entry. 
t1_duaiyvz	0	*	My semiauto hand gun was the quickest in and out purchase. 
t1_dua6xs9	0	*	A little harsh, more like possibly nowhere else in the developed world do people need guns for self defense.
t1_dua6rnw	1	*	At least in my own family they justify it with a bunch of crap about Jihadist sleeper cells and the impending Islamist coup  Fear mongering is a hell of a drug
t1_dua60h7	1	*	No worries, the country is pretty divided lets make it worse.
t1_dua5lhm	0	*	Yes, they give a shit, because a bullet outside of the head hurts. Lack of control is scary. 
t1_duaalgz	1	*	Giving them easy access to guns makes it easier for them to rack up larger numbers of murders.

t1_ds7v3u0	1	*	Right!   Also as an input I love Alex the Parrot and cried when first reading the book on her
t1_ds7q9ab	0	*	I want is not a question. But you've proven my point to both myself and anyone reading our exchange.  
t1_dtc5adc	0	*	[Sure](https://healthybutsmart.com/squatty-potty/).  Dubious at best, like I said.
t1_dsctp7d	0	*	Then why were they all marching under Nazi and Slaver flags?
t1_dscwodq	1	*	That sounds familiar, Nazis are a diverse people oddly enough - though they aren't too happy about that 
t1_dsd1dr7	1	*	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alt-right  Why bullshit?
t1_dscoji9	0	*	child pageants are some of the most disgusting and disturbing things I've ever come across and I'm pretty sure they attract a lot of pedophiles.
t1_dse51ia	0	*	Oh, please. There were Nazis and there were people who opposed the Nazis. And guess what, the Nazis were the violent ones. 
t1_dsc5688	1	*	Middle... *Weast*?
t1_dsbzf3n	0	*	i see islam going hand in hand with problematic middle eastern and north african countries, and it doesnt take a leap of logic to associate the two
t1_dscb767	0	*	Is there no such thing as black, then? I think most agree there is such a thing as black culture.
t1_dsc5uys	0	*	None of what you said makes Islam okay. The beliefs of Islam, and the number of believers who believe in ridiculous ideas is a proven fact. Or do you deny this? 
t1_dscknov	1	*	The Arab Spring (and subsequent Western intervention) is one the most fascinating and consequential political phenomenons that never gets discussed with proper context.
t1_dscmzzg	0	*	> When have you ever seen a child of a white blonde woman and black man with blonde hair and/or blue eyes?  Yes?
t1_dsdotem	1	*	Yeah, people writing death threats to a baby are far right dicks.  The debate we were having had more to do with immigration into Europe as a whole, rather than this specific baby.
t1_dscf0uv	0	*	So you do actually believe that people will take you seriously when you compare white europeans not giving birth to actual genocide of native americans, lmfao
t1_dscjim3	0	*	I don't remember, she was maybe 14 though.
t1_dsce5mr	0	*	I meant an example for a reason, not a child you consider beautiful.

t1_dsckfh3	0	*	No worries Stalin wanabe.
t1_dscwdp8	0	*	Spanish thats based around latin america Spanish is moderately different than the one used in Spain. We borrow some words but the accent and how we spell things out are different.
t1_dschttx	0	*	lol at people thinking i dont have a problem with other religions in my community
t1_dsc7kzn	0	*	For all intents and purposes islam is a race in the western world. When people refer to Muslims they don't mean Indonesians, South Sudanians, Kenians etc..
t1_dsbwkse	0	*	why is it always black and white with you guys? im trying to wipe the brutalities of my own culture while keeping out bad influences too... i dont want to trade one thing for another
t1_dscpafl	0	*	So a white person who loves his country is a neo-Nazi.  The more I learn!
t1_dsceg8j	1	*	There are huge differences but to say they are polar opposite, or the most different cultures on the planet is a bit of a stretch. 
t1_dscc5c3	0	*	Looking at pictures of kids on the internet is pedophilia.  It's like how I got arrested for bestiality charges because I spent too much time on /r/rarepuppers  
t1_dschpmd	0	*	Dude, why do you care?
t1_dsby6bj	1	*	Nope, totally different, nothing alike.
t1_dscewpu	0	*	I gave an example though. Why don't Democrats want to mass import poor people from conservative areas that want smaller government? Why dont they say open the borders to the eastern bloc countries?
t1_dscw3vb	0	*	Wow, Arabs commit rape in much higher numbers. 
t1_dsbwsi2	0	*	Once muslims become the majority, you will pay tribute you filthy non believer.

t1_dsc9mya	0	*	Those are literally just the people that voted. They don't track nonvoters. It literally says it's based off exit polls.
t1_dscwc70	1	*	Its ok, I understand asking for the reasoning behind a laden message was indeed too crazy for you.  Hopefully one day you will be less scared of people who think differently than you.
t1_dsc8v9r	1	*	Look up kin selection. 
t1_dscehw7	0	*	Id say its only a matter of time.  What you see now in Indonesia is just the foreshadowing. 
t1_dseblvw	1	*	I meant for the time and place. Some real fucked up shit has happened in the world's history, no doubt.
t1_dsdyywz	1	*	Offended? I wouldn't even be surprised. My culture is not theirs and that's the whole point. And that doesn't answer my question anyway.
t1_dsfeg82	0	*	Yes, I am aware of the terrorist attacks, but that doesn't mean that the majority of Muslim immigrant children will turn out to be terrorists.  
t1_dsce9lx	1	*	I know what you mean but keeping track of one specific cute kid just seems strange to me.  I didn't know that pre-teen girls like to look at little girls.
t1_dsbyfvs	0	*	I'm not. And you're contributing literally nothing but baseless contrarian filler to the exchange. Have you ever had an idea that Alex Jones didn't suggest to you?
t1_dsc9i7d	0	*	Exactly. Most extinct native American tribes's DNA can still be found in living people today, who just look a little different. Not a big deal.
t1_dsciri5	1	*	And it faces a massive problem with population drops because of it. The US would be in a similar situation if we didn't have large amounts of immigration. 
t1_dscbyn8	0	*	90% blacks voting democrat and 70% Hispanics voting democrat isn't evenly divided as far as I know by the definition of evenly.
t1_dscecq8	0	*	I thought instagram was a teen/ young adult / adult thing, maybe I'm too out of the loop but do little kids (5-10) year olds use instagram that much?

t1_dtgsvbw	0	*	Most is still incorrect 
t1_dtgvvu4	0	*	Lol I really hurt your feelings huh. You look through my post history instead of informing yourself like a respectful adult?  Shocking how I could ever mistake you for a kid.
t1_dtgxeb9	0	*	You realised how stupid that comment was then deleted it....  Good choice it was really stupid

t1_dt3xwfy	1	*	Yeah, the bait was pretty obvious.
t1_dt3zv5j	1	*	I live in a house built in 1964 but the hot water heater is newer. In general though, any hot water heater is a bad place to store water for drinking.

t1_dupogab	0	*	Sie ist sogar sehr gut!
t1_dupnu5m	1	*	NSA does not have a budget the size of Russian GDP. That would put it in the trillions, outshining all military spending combined. That would be an outrageous budget for a security agency.
t1_dusvxm1	1	*	Did you know what the word benefits mean?
t1_dupqwtj	1	*	Thats what I talked about before rambling about trains, sorry for the rant.
t1_dupmtbg	0	*	Because it's very often Americans trying push some narrative that Europe is unsafe and destroyed by refugees, while that obvious bullshit.
t1_dupn2ww	0	*	Yeah I guess time frame matters.  Either way we all agree this is a huge benefit to Germany the way the Euro is set up.
t1_durkd8y	0	*	Quarterly.  That's a YEARLY projection, fyi.  The average GDP growth was abysmal and index ROIs topped 8% versus 22% index ROIs under Trump.
t1_dupirbn	0	*	Oh man, so owned. Thanks for bringing your logic hammer with you. 
t1_dupj6uz	0	*	Kind if interesting that there has never been a leak of such a thing in the US, but lots in Russia. But yeah, conspiracies.

t1_dupznfj	1	*	What I understood from this is that the EU got Greece more credibility and allowed them to get lent even more money.   Still sounds like incompetence and mismanagement from Greece to me.
t1_durn3su	0	*	well at least there are countries that are stable.
t1_dupr59w	0	*	Of Germany?
t1_duprj9a	1	*	Yep.  It isn't even an Oligarchy, because the elites in Russia aren't oligarchs because they have no power.  They are just rich cronies.

t1_dupmnip	0	*	I was saying the liberal version of what you're describing is reframing Republican policy by pushing talking points about worldviews that no one really holds. 
t1_dupt32j	0	*	Its called the rule of the fourth power (at least in German): Increase the weight on the axis by ten then the load on the road changes 10\*10\*10\*10=10000 \. 
t1_dtn4gaf	0	*	I was talking about knowing who was paying. Considering that the democrat part wasn't paying until more than halfway through
t1_dtnd874	0	*	I view him as someone who was in Trump's inner circle and a key part of his collusion with Russian.  I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one.

t1_dt8pis2	1	*	Thats not the Church. That's one archdiocese. Get back to me when Rome starts spending money on that. 
t1_dt6f7p3	1	*	I doubt you have the right to say that in prison, you absolute pedo

t1_dugpifq	0	*	Hey, we should just let our troops die instead like our fathers, brothers, uncles, sons instead of using drones.
t1_dugoczm	0	*	Incorrect. Page 31 of the GOPs platform states that children should not have gay parents. You got 1 out of 2 though. That's not bad.

t1_dugprdb	0	*	Uh, no, it's true.   Hillary won the Democratic vote by *millions*. The DNC had no say over that.  It's all documented, read it up.

t1_dugu6gw	0	*	Nobody said Hillary was elected president.   She was the people the american public voted for though

t1_dugrebn	1	*	Totally agreed. This was my first election and the whole concept of super delegates pissed me off.
t1_dugyab2	0	*	The person wins presidency by receiving the plurality of the votes of all Americans who vote, rather than by the electoral college.
t1_dugr3up	1	*	While I am not in support of any war or violence, I think a strong argument can be made that the use of drones dramatically reduces both civilian and military casualties on both sides. 
t1_dugpu81	1	*	feel free to look at the latest indictments this weeks that showed that both sanders and  trump both got undue support from Russian accounts saying exactly what you are saying.
t1_dupx4bu	0	*	not really interested in links, but I'm guessing it's not a picture of you understanding what propaganda looks like
t1_dui5cxq	0	*	How? Give actual reasons. Sanders lost the popular vote by a large margin. Democrats just didn't want him. 
t1_dugygt8	1	*	None of this has anything to do with my original comment. Ill leave you trump bots to it

t1_dugsg2p	0	*	Smear campaign by who? Trump?  Man come on, Bernie didn't have anywhere near the baggage that Hillary did

t1_dtwl1bs	1	*	You must be dense. 
t1_dtvyt0q	0	*	Yes, civilian casualties as a result of counter-terrorism are terrible.     However the US Army is not summarily rounding up and executing children; this is why your whataboutism is showing. 
t1_dtx8jjl	0	*	Sorry my fault. I shouldn't care how stupid people from whatever shithole you are from are because you clearly can't understand plain English.  Should've known you were a fucking troll.
