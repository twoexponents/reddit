t1_ds7o2uk	0	*	You made no other points. And once again, I never justified the actions of the Japanese. You keep making it sound like I did. We are talking explicitly about threats to the nation of Japan.
t1_dtcqeur	0	*	You are anti-boeing.  You are saying benign things boeing has done, that bombardier and all other businesses do, counts against boeing, but is fine for everyone else.
t1_dtbpnag	0	*	Canada, this was a big thumb in our eye along with the repeated softwood lumber issue.
t1_dubc2la	1	*	Have you heard of those crazy flying contraptions theyve built nowadays?
t1_dun1u8b	1	*	The capital from this corruption, perhaps valued in trillions, sits safely and confortably in Swiss banks.
t1_dunah6n	1	*	Yes, I'm pretty sure a lot of our big Swiss companies (Glencore *cough*, Nestlxe9 *cough*) are part of what makes third world countries go higher on the corruption index.
t1_dune2h4	1	*	The *non-binding* referendum, you mean?
t1_dunqeve	0	*	It's not corruption if the laws are made through the right procedures. Morally corrupt? Yes, but legally corrupt? No.
t1_dumeq6x	1	*	Not similar at all. Please stop spreading lies you read in tabloids.  If you're not educated about the subject, just refrain from talking about it at all.
t1_dunc63d	1	*	People like to talk about things that they don't really understand. That's one of the downsides of the net.
t1_duaai5m	1	*	or maybe it's just such a tiny percentage of the population it's irrelevant
t1_duapttp	0	*	> Yeah, considering the reality of how people live makes me hate capitalism  Yep. You're agenda posting Canadian (so you have no experience with the NHS). Nothing new here.
t1_ducmrkd	0	*	Ah yes the classic if you don't like the guy who helped put in place a murderous fascist dictatorship it is YOU who are a fascist.  Return to r/neoliberal and stay there dude.

t1_dtni0xs	1	*	Yup! 
t1_dtlo502	0	*	No, I'm saying that the government getting money from heroin addicts incentives them to make more heroin addicts. Especially if it's at all possible to reroute that money. 
t1_dtlktl9	1	*	The first sentence of this is so very true.  The longer lasting opiates/opioids are much much harder to get off of.
t1_dtlj4i2	0	*	Can you sedate yourself through that shit at all like if you had the right stuff or does that make no sense?
t1_dtlkv5b	1	*	Gabapentin too!
t1_dtlwxwr	0	*	Exactly. The reason why I dont affiliate with the GOP at all.  Too biased. Too one sided. Too narrow minded. Too ignorant.   EDIT: also more libertarian (small L) than anything else. 
t1_dtln74l	1	*	Diacetylmorphine is the same thing as diamorphine.   Diamorphine is just the condensed word.   Both heroin. 
t1_dtlvjc5	0	*	Either trudeau isn't well covered in the states or i haven't seen anything scandalous. What do you mean? Here, we only hear about him when we're jerking off about some policy of trumps he opposed.
t1_dubq8pz	0	*	I don't know about that. From everything I've heard and read, it's true. I'm definitely not going to risk it

t1_dubvvoc	0	*	I don't want a point by point debate, I asked for 1 example. I listed several verifiable facts, and all you can say is you're full of shit. You can't even provide one example. lol.
t1_dubqc5v	0	*	Someone said that it's not true that it needs to be after the first frost. I'm sure that it's not all rabbits that will make you sick if eaten at the wrong time. It's just a rule of thumb I hear a lot
t1_duc64y6	0	*	Thats not how  it works. You made the statement you should provide evidence. 
t1_dudk2lm	0	*	It seems the punchline is that you responded to a pun chain without a pun and u/thrway1312 is tricking people into trying to find a deeper meaning
t1_dubzih2	1	*	Thanks for the honest answer OP.  Hope you find peace man.
t1_duc88b4	1	*	There are far less ticks in winter, so less risks of catching tularemia or other nice gifts from the rabbits (Rickettsia, Borrelia, etc...).

t1_dt24qe7	0	*	Keep screaming think about the children to demonize people who are smart enough to understand that these things don't matter when you're looking to kill the most wanted terrorist in the world.
t1_dt2ovgt	1	*	Yeah, I agree with you there. Maybe a panel of trained judges instead? They tend to do that sort of thing when there is no way of getting an impartial jury 
t1_dt2p5b4	0	*	> Hardly moronic.  Do you work in PR? Most people wouldn't bother trying to spin obvious failures into success stories.
t1_dt2cq9d	1	*	In my opinion it is the Jedi who are evil
t1_dt38k7j	0	*	Okay, sorry I'm just confused. What part of Ukraine are we talking about here?
t1_dsb3a4d	0	*	'proxy invasion' by a force specifically created, trained, armed, commanded, and supported by the USA just for that one purpose
t1_ds9tk6i	0	*	OK but then how do you even define communism - it becomes pointless.

t1_duk2gwl	0	*	I think there is plenty of reason to be skeptical about Israel's asylum process
t1_dujf6zy	0	*	Are they deported in a safe country?  Are they deported and considered like human beings while deported?  
t1_duk0yz3	1	*	They might be, but they arent bothering to find out
t1_dujffub	0	*	A) how can you possibly know without proper checks and B) how can you know that Egypt can be considered a safe nation for all of these 37000 people? 
t1_dswlza0	1	*	Don't worry I'm not, just trying to change my communication approach. 
t1_dsvh7uf	1	*	Good point

t1_dvak70j	1	*	Yeah I get 300 but my devices are too old to really handle any of it. Netflix looks pretty great in 4K though. 
t1_dv4dmzo	1	*	It's called entitlement. I suspect most of the people complaining aren't the ones who pay the bill ;)

t1_ds5hgev	1	*	Is she orange and stripey? If so, she's a keeper.
t1_ds5d5m1	0	*	Youre paying them less because they asked for less. All the men who asked for less are also being paid less.

t1_ds5dkjo	0	*	Why should that burden fall on the employer?
t1_ds5deam	0	*	There is no discrimination. People who don't hard bargain are being paid less -- and the majority of those people happen to be women.  Where do you see discrimination?  
t1_ds5gdwg	0	*	Because that's personal information and I have the right to not share it if I don't want to?

t1_dtob4fk	1	*	Can we at least agree that his comment is ambiguous?
t1_dto4lyk	1	*	Trade deficit is not debt.  Trade deficit nabs that we buy more shit from Canada than Canada buys from us.  Which is true of nearly all of our trade partners.

t1_dto18ii	1	*	No, your fantasies don't equate with reality.
t1_dto4dh8	0	*	What he proposed is a perfect example of democracy.  The phrase I only believe in democracy when it suits me applies to you, more than it does to the person youre replying to.
t1_dtnz3e5	1	*	Chinese knock off milk, salmon and softwood lumber are not exactly big sellers.  Canada doesn't make shit to sell, Canada sells the things you use to make shit to sell.  
t1_dto4twk	0	*	Yes because some people don't need it literally explained and broken down. Median income describes the most common midpoint of the population and multiply by the population number.

t1_dto2sc6	0	*	Pay it back ? They're 12 billion down. 
t1_dtnzivr	1	*	That makes no sense at all. 
t1_dto1kcu	0	*	And Trump staying there every other weekend definitely doesn't encourage foreign diplomats to stay there if they want our president's ear. Right.

t1_dto7go9	0	*	what has been alleged, and what you are alleging, is quite absurd, with literally no evidence or proof to support it.  It's quite nihilistic don't you think?
t1_dtowpop	0	*	Im saving this for later.  Also do you mean West Coast? Im not sure how Vancouver would steal business from the East Coast, although I dont know much about international shipping. 
t1_dtny29b	1	*	But the Republicans of today have little in common with the Republicans of Lincoln. Lincoln wasn't exactly a State's Rights kinda guy.
t1_dtq2321	0	*	He is a coward. Period. Didn't even have the guts to leave the country like thousands of others did. He's a fucking coward.  BTW remind me which one of his kids went off to Iraq or Afghanistan again.

t1_dum69k7	1	*	Actually no, I'm saying what I am saying: they are not the same. 
t1_duwcdnt	0	*	Russia is not an threat to US. Soviet Union was a little bit bigger than modern Russia, and economically Russia no where near China or US.  
t1_dundfa1	1	*	What? I confirmed that it was indeed the presidential election I referred to... You're a really fragile one, aren't you.

t1_du0dvqv	0	*	*morale**
t1_dtzverf	0	*	Russia spends 69 billion a year on the military.  You could cut it to 400 billion and rebuild with 8 years instead of 4 
t1_dtzzwvv	1	*	How much are the saving for the typical taxpayer?  Please note I didn't say average and please include how much their kids will have to pay extra due to the interest on the debt.

t1_durb2ve	0	*	They didn't come from Syria, they came from Northern Africa. Germany was responsible. 
t1_durhqj6	1	*	It's definitely taught but they tend to just use it as background information on what led up to World War 2 
t1_duruhwv	1	*	YouTube comments lol and I guess other people. Remember we have to share a state with them :v
t1_dus26p6	1	*	Yea. That it should be avoided but sometimes necessary. It shouldn't be something glorious but something occasionally necessary to stop a worse evil. See Nazi Germany.

t1_dure6il	1	*	What did you learn about WW1 from BF1?
t1_durf0x2	1	*	In some cases yes, but it's foolish to act like the USA over covers atrocities done because of the intentionally diseased blanket myth being seemingly propagated.

t1_dus65tv	1	*	I was wrong apparently strategic bombings wasn't explicitly made to be illegal under the laws of the time

t1_dute39u	0	*	Prior to this, the Japanese had a bad habit of murdering shipwreck survivors.
t1_duriub0	1	*	Thats fine. As can I. Difference is that one of us is staying on base while the other just seems to keep digging themselves into a deeper hole. 
t1_durcqx7	0	*	This just in!: humans have been shitty to other humans forever. Stop being shitty to other humans! - every religion ever.
t1_durfaym	1	*	Lol, WW1 is taught here. Who the fuck told you that? 
t1_durawsc	0	*	Well it is taught here but not that much to my knowlege. Its mainly glossed over to give context to WWI. Well at least where i went to school
t1_durcuok	0	*	Wait I thought it was about WWI Germans and a soldiers account of it?

t1_duri61l	1	*	 And to think, all that time it was your cup that was poisoned. Man in Black: They were both poisoned. I spent the last few years building up an immunity to iocane powder.
t1_durlqc1	0	*	The one you were too stupid to know to give.
t1_durki37	0	*	It's not an excuse. It's the truth. Yes. Lots of people died in ww2. Why are you denigrating the deaths of innocent japanese men, women and children?  
t1_durcnot	1	*	My age? 30s. And yeah we didnt learn really anything about WWI it was manily just to give context for WWII which we covered waaaay more extensively

t1_durkpc6	1	*	So it was relevant.  Cool
t1_durp0ef	1	*	Ah, right.

t1_durdbfb	1	*	Kind of, but it wasn't at the start of the war. German bombs hitting civilian targets in England caused retaliation and it took off from there.
t1_dur9hef	0	*	Now youre talking about something else 
t1_duro3cj	0	*	And here you are, explaining why you won't explain something.  
t1_durdf6c	1	*	As I said I'm not OP, but I'll be extra clear.   ---  ***I DO NOT OPPOSE THESE SURVIVORS TELLING THEIR STORIES***  ---  What I do oppose is the Japanese government promoting it.

t1_dv3ag3e	0	*	Ah.  Okay.  Well, I'm sure that there are several groups of people who agree with you, and are willing to live in a society that enforces that mentality.  I'm glad that I'm not in one.
t1_dsf7rvg	0	*	>Presented to who?   To the public. All I'm doing is pushing back on the automatic assumption that there was a nefarious motive behind this move. 
t1_dsfe4f3	1	*	Sounds good except when you realize that for every product you have to buy, there's not always a competitor that produces an eco-friendly alternative.
t1_dsewwc9	0	*	Thats why its suggesting researching into that information to inform people. We waste so much food and I just think we should look into this as a way of alleviating that problem however so slightly.

t1_dtbgl69	0	*	No, because I didn't actually argue against me extending his logic to another position (hence the term straw-man *argument*), I simply asked him for his opinion on that scenario. Try and keep up.

t1_dua6pbe	0	*	>muricasogreat!  Meanwhile I insulin shots everyday cuz i lack the controls of my own blood sugar, doesn't matter tho cuz i'm political power house!
t1_du8n903	1	*	Just put it in your will and tell the people that if they don't give up your body they lose their inheritance if they withhold your body. 
t1_du915cj	0	*	No it is not.
t1_du92mhz	0	*	No one is being forced to opt-out :) 
t1_du8ghjx	0	*	Also what we call uptight, Americans call Liberal.  Democrats are called leftists in America, but here most democrat officials would be considered center right when it comes to most issues
t1_du8n6w2	0	*	He's saying that many medical procedures can be seen as hurting the patient. Chemotherapy damages your body, antibiotics kill gut flora, and amputations maim.
t1_du8x89x	0	*	I've always been an organ donor, some people are very poor and literally don't have the dollar to spare. 
t1_du8qybn	0	*	I disagree. Simply because of the reaction just these comments are getting. I feel like you're underestimating how large the cult following is.
t1_du8sd1g	0	*	If it saves someone's life, then yes, get over it. 
t1_du8wc7q	1	*	Yeah, I myself have always been hugely pro donation and even I couldn't be arsed to register when I turned 18, I only registered when I was almost 20. I've always supported this law for that reason
t1_duaejex	0	*	Nobody is entitled to other peoples body parts. No way- even if I need a heart tomorrow I am not owed one.  
t1_du8o95w	0	*	You distorced everything now. Your argument was jews have right over the land because they lived there hundred years ago before roman and ottoman invasion. Just get your things right.
t1_duednpu	0	*	I do not understand how you have an issue with us there's an organ that is up for grabs and all things being equal, the one who is the registered organ donor gets it
t1_du8y9p4	0	*	Don't be silly! It's not illegal, it's just frowned upon. 
t1_du8eklr	1	*	Thank you for this. I laughed so hard.
t1_du9ehpv	1	*	Usually yes, if your kidneys die your body basically becomes filled with poison over time. This causes cell death all over the body, which is actually what ends up killing you in the end. - /u/FyeUK
t1_dua09ep	0	*	I don't get what you your point is. That attending someone's funeral gives you ome right over their body? Because that sounds very wrong. Edit: spelling
t1_du8qweq	0	*	> 400000$  The sarcasm was only apparent to me because you put the $ after the amount. Other than that this unfortunately appears too realistic for it to be sarcasm.
t1_du8miwg	0	*	Huh. TIL you can reddit from prison.
t1_du92w6p	1	*	My wife had ACL reconstruction. For her surgery they used a piece of hamstring but her surgeon said if she were still playing competitive basketball he would have tried to get a cadaver ACL. 
t1_du8go0f	0	*	Set a booby trap in your will, all your shit goes to a charity if your family refuses to obey your desire to donate organs.
t1_du9l8eq	0	*	> Yes you do have a choice. You opt-out.  Please tell me how having only one option is a choice in this case.  There's your problem.
t1_du95p15	0	*	And if your organs are so special to you, you can opt out. If that is too difficult then you should vote or protest against it. If you can't do either then your bits provably won't be used. 
t1_du8slba	0	*	Oh cry me a river. Grow up.
t1_du8gp90	1	*	Serious question:  If you were dying in the hospital and had *some* time to prepare, could you ensure the donation by keeping a copy of your will in the hospital and informing your nurse/doctor?   
t1_du8n4so	0	*	And that's morally wrong and the government acting against someone's will when it comes to their bodies.
t1_du8wew9	0	*	This is barbaric. Some people get more rights than others? Some people have to suffer because they can't pay more? These death panels are an infringement of rights!
t1_du8hby7	1	*	But you'e a rare bird over there.
t1_du8jt18	1	*	And if more people were donors, fewer people would die because there would be more organs available.
t1_du8bv7r	1	*	Indeed 
t1_du9t83h	1	*	Awwww why not? Please? ;_;
t1_du8gdeu	0	*	Yes? But this is about bodily integrity. Just like the government cannot force you to undergo a medical procedure, so the government shouldn't be able to decide for you that you are a donor.
t1_du8ho11	0	*	I'm not advocating lying. But if you are braindead you are brain dead, not pretty much brain dead.
t1_du8demk	1	*	Yeah that's fair :[
t1_du8f0l3	1	*	Yup.  I was just struck by how -- if you omit context -- it would completely fit the pro-/anti-abortion debate. 
t1_du8teus	0	*	I do in fact. I am from Belgium, where this system is also in place. And yea, the lawmakers aren't just talking out of their assess when they come up with this.
t1_du8zdr3	0	*	Wow. That is insane. Perpetuating this stuff isn't helpful.
t1_du942rw	0	*	I think we all know that something being illegal and something being wrong are different. 
t1_du8z3hu	1	*	Uhhhhhhhhhhh
t1_du8hw4t	0	*	Doesn't matter. If you kill them, you're the only relative and you'll have the last word on it. 
t1_du8h8z2	0	*	Yes. 
t1_duap330	0	*	 What a complete fuck of a person you must be if you would give your organs to criminals before children. 
t1_du8f3d6	0	*	We'll take your cops, we can use a few more dead criminals as a deterrent with our weak justice system 
t1_du8htn8	1	*	Hopefully.
t1_du8hl3o	1	*	Actually, yes. As long as you somewhat remains healthy for the 30 years you're in prison, you're good.
t1_du9rdlp	0	*	So just opt out.  The other has you doing nothing.
t1_dt4k352	0	*	Your reponses to the fact that priest child rape is out of control make it seem like you are personally being attacked.  Why do you feel the need to lash out at others discussing this serious issue?
t1_dt30ne4	0	*	You must have some decency. I mean to you it matters what degree he participated, whether or not he was in room, not that he covered up the rape of children.
t1_dt3tn7s	1	*	Just so you know, you're still a brother/sister to me even if you leave the fold <3.
t1_dtpkedp	0	*	Not to sound like a Russia-Apologist but the American track record is arguably even worse. Id trust RT before a US government funded station at this point!
t1_dtpjbxg	0	*	The Senate Intel Committee is releasing more documents on FBI collusion, and the House is looking to appoint a prosecutor to investigate the current ones. We'll sure see. :)
t1_dtpvaii	0	*	Thats exactly what im saying. Youve been missing the point the whole time because you got upset that someone called fox news propaganda.
t1_dts49tb	0	*	This is so pathetic, lol.
t1_dtp5hhh	0	*	Because DAG Ohr and Dem-supporting FBI officials funneled it through a rubber stamp court to get an insurance policy that would stop a Trump Presidency.
t1_dtp7s21	1	*	That was their shit attempt to throw those of us off who know the truth.
t1_dtp4wlj	0	*	Can you name me an above-board, for-profit company that specifically calls itself an NGO? I'm not trying to pin you down, it's just I've literally never heard of one.
t1_dtp6ajc	1	*	Were all NGOs on this blessed day. 
t1_dtpv0xc	0	*	No system is perfect.  >Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others.  Winston S. Churchill 
t1_dtpjomt	1	*	Oh okay, yeah the giant octopus is totally menacing, I agree. 
t1_dtpdtba	1	*	Its from [That Mitchell and Webb Look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hn1VxaMEjRU), a sketch comedy
t1_dtp61ha	0	*	Yes. That is the point. Every video. Every source. Information on everything. 
t1_dtr4gi8	0	*	Pick a random YouTube personality  Otherwise gonna have to wait for me to have some time to get to a PC later
t1_dtpk696	1	*	I'm only reporting what the memo says.
t1_dtqx5p0	1	*	Sponsored by redbull. 
t1_dtp3s60	0	*	I'm curious how they pulled that off.   Okay the entire league is now for profit except our headquarters. There's no profit there.
t1_dtp6kgf	0	*	To correct this, the Republicans and the GOP funded the Steele dossier. HRC and the DNC jumped on after. So both parties funded it.
t1_ds3toxw	1	*	I don't know what they would want to do. Doesn't mean they aren't a nuclear state. 
t1_ds3b0hl	0	*	Honest question.   How will the rest of the world react to this, from your perspective?
t1_dv3tmfl	0	*	saksak, can't say I have come across this.  Would appreciate an enlightenment!  If saksak is pidgin I have my suspicions!

t1_dul3o0t	0	*	I can understand the difference but I wonder do people still use in the old meaning nowadays and do people use the old meaning frequently so I can avoid misunderstandings next time. 
t1_dulbj21	0	*	Are you fucking serious? You're having an advanced conversation with a person who has Wu in their name. How's your Mandarin? Oh, you don't speak a single word, you say? 
t1_dumll19	0	*	Yeaaahh, but just like the American people, American English is both versatile and inclusive of those not lucky enough to be born here. 
t1_dung3n2	1	*	Yes , The majority of small kids have been attacked by nipples at one time or another. 
t1_dumhqz6	0	*	So are you going to provide an argument or are you just going to keep up with these ad hominem attacks?
t1_dskq1gb	0	*	So you think we should end legal immigration? 
t1_dskmxrx	1	*	Wouldn't hurt given that the Cockwomble has already antagonized even the closest of American allies with his uncouth speech and stupidity.
t1_dskksd1	1	*	Everyone learns. it doesn't matter what country people are from, they're usually completely integrated after 2-3 generations. This is what Trump seems to forget.
t1_dsl8cwa	1	*	Look at you, reading a username. You appear to be incapable of discourse.   Glhf with that. Stay angry kid.
t1_dsku2dl	1	*	It's fucking hilarious, it reads like perfect satire.
t1_dslzlaf	0	*	Who said they arent? Whats your excuse?
t1_dskm5y8	0	*	No I don't think I can, its pretty fucking clear you are just here to deflect.
t1_dskxnwf	1	*	Yea, im sure Russia and China can operate on such a scale that the US could /s Seriously, how deluded are people?
t1_dskrz6u	0	*	You made a statement claiming that I must be of some slavic background. You haven't just been asking questions but it's ok, you're mentally handicapped so I'll leave you be now
t1_dslcr0d	0	*	Great.  Not an impeachable offense.  The tax cut is pretty much going to even reduce the poors taxes (those that pay them), just a FYI.  What you are saying is unrealistic.
t1_dskm8t0	0	*	You don't think Trump could concoct that idea and then sell it to his base?  Sure in reality that shit wouldn't fly, but he lives in candy land.
t1_dskmjb4	0	*	> school shootings  Haven't had any of those in a few weeks. I think we're overdue.
t1_dsxihjn	1	*	Try looking at the thread title. Tim Horton's aint the only bitch, I wager.
t1_dt5hunr	1	*	If regulation didn't suppress innovation so much, they'd never be able to call it 'ham', 'salami' or 'bologna'.
t1_dsxq6r2	0	*	Thats on your employer, dont like it get a new employer. Union Workers cant just change employers and see a difference.

t1_dt2htwl	1	*	[Insert Willy Wonka meme here]
t1_dsy27u4	0	*	Ok why don't you tell me? Is it your position that the company pays 3.5% tax and then the owner gets the rest without paying any more?
t1_dt2nmpl	0	*	But they're not a hive mind..
t1_dsy1xxa	0	*	I'm not disagreeing with that part, I'm disagreeing with where he said the company got the same amount they would have if the employee wasn't pocketing the money. Try to keep up.
t1_dsy5ms4	1	*	Oh gotcha. No worries. Cheers mate. 
t1_dsyrgl1	0	*	Urban dictionary isn't a good site for facts either... I'm pretty sure you're the troll

t1_dsxw2by	0	*	I'm sorry what? I didn't understand that sentence, or two, or what ever that was supposed to be.
t1_dt5xr1v	0	*	Lol   I live in Australia. Try again.
t1_dtnblnk	1	*	Yeah I find no problem with your assessments. Regulation will be at least somewhat necessary and I hope whoever is in charge approaches their power with the same attitude you have here
t1_dtnakrt	0	*	As a white person I have to say we have things pretty easy. If that's the worst things happening to white people then I think we have it pretty well off.

t1_ds3zef4	1	*	I dont care where it is...its a completely absurdly disproportionate response that is *murder*. This is the stuff that Duterte would - quite literally - kill for. 
t1_ds3o1u5	0	*	Hold my bomb.
t1_ds521qb	0	*	Developing nations that have received literally billions in foreign aid over decades yet cant seem to get developed. 
t1_ds3zese	1	*	We need to train rats that will train their offspring to swarm humans that show aggression... It'd be like self-replicating police.
t1_ds6ybs1	1	*	Sure, anyone dedicated in bringing down prices can succeed in finding ways to.   Note: things I quote are for my reference later as well as for others to view. 
t1_dtvc5s2	0	*	now we are going around in circles right?   Typical internet warrior. Content = 0, Deflection over 9000. 
t1_dsohfl3	0	*	Well reasoned
t1_dv1la76	0	*	Lol, you cant bring up unrelated cases in a court hearing about a different crime. What you are suggesting make no sense

t1_dtvp1kl	1	*	> hey, hey buddy, come watch some vegan propaganda.  Literally every reply.
t1_dtvfysz	0	*	Imagine a world where we do things because they are right, not because it makes money. It's sad that sociopaths think something doesn't have value if it can't be monetized 
t1_dtvlp06	1	*	It goes in *multiple* dudes' pockets.  Nobody is going to risk getting killed by poachers for some pocket change.
t1_dtxlte1	0	*	After all of your responses, I stand by my original comment. Also just to let the air out of your sails, I graduated from a 4 year University. Let me know when you graduate high school. 
t1_dtvp3yw	0	*	YOU might want to read some texts that are not only printed in hunter magazines: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/hunting-big-game-why-people-kill-animals-for-fun/  pathetic.
t1_du30vkh	1	*	They can take a bit more time to observe which animals are actually dangerous to their species or others (some of those older bulls can be, especially if theyre sterile) and remove them
t1_dtvnahq	0	*	Cain is my hero. he has such a serious BlackAdder feel, even down to the Baldric-type of sidekick.  
t1_dtvfpwk	0	*	I dont think thats true...pigs are really smart and emotional, they probably are super panicked
t1_dtvtycp	0	*	They don't get given food or water roughly 24hours before being slaughtered, look it up. 
t1_dtwzar2	1	*	Meat is still one of the best sources of protein. Eggs and dairy are the other best sources of protein. It's easy to see the appeal of a vegan diet, but it does require some nutritional sacrifices.
t1_dtvgqpw	0	*	Did you not like Babe Pig in the City? Sheesh! 
t1_dtvfcja	0	*	That be the case yes, but the evilness is still doing good in the aggregate 
t1_dtwfsex	0	*	I don't think there's any point trying to explain sociopathic behavior to someone who can't fathom why human lives are more valuable than, say, a gerbils
t1_dtw9u9n	0	*	It's hilarious that you think all gaming goes through legal means. But please keep lying to yourself that there is no corruption in Africa or these hunts
t1_dtvehho	0	*	(I don't know what we are disagreeing about)
t1_dtwkabe	0	*	It's a metaphor meant to contrast the double standard.  It's no different from poaching, other than they have a permit. 
t1_dtvg248	0	*	You mean women and children.
t1_dtwuaoa	1	*	If the outcome is him whining about people thinking he's a monster, the way to change it is to not make his donation contingent on killing the animal himself.  
t1_dtvga1r	0	*	I honestly have no clue on what your stance on hunting is... could you elaborate?
t1_dtvq86v	0	*	We can eat lion. The locals do to survive. It's absolutely no different in practicality, except that the hunter gets joy.
t1_dtzsayl	0	*	Both are extremely arbitrary. I don't think you understand what arbitrary means.
t1_dtvm2k2	0	*	So to be clear, people who hunt deer, pheasants, grouse, and water fowl are in your mind mentality I'll? 
t1_dtvl4am	0	*	You can defend poaching all you want, but I'm still going to root for the poacher hunters
t1_dtvfqah	0	*	Then what would people eat to feel better about themselves?
t1_dtvpg7d	0	*	You're nothing but talk
t1_dtvfi4x	0	*	You should watch the movie Okja on Netflix. Not a documentary but definitely hits on the emotion.
t1_dtvnwg8	0	*	I think that for everyone in the modern its a very viable option, unless you have a severe allergy to legumes and starches you should be fine.
t1_dtvo77m	0	*	If it's not possible for someone then I'm not talking to them. There are a lot of shoulds that are only accessible to people with certain means, this is no different.
t1_dtvmbgg	0	*	You're probably tasty too, can I kill and eat you?
t1_dtvhseb	0	*	Then go ahead and donate the hundreds these people pay, and ask your friend to do the same.
t1_dtvk6k5	1	*	Oh definitely, its way better than poaching, my issue is when the people who do it make it out to be some difficult task and that is something to be proud of/an accomplishment.
t1_dtvvtf3	0	*	> by shooting animals with birth control darts    Wtf lol.. thats not a real thing, is it?
t1_dtvfvtt	1	*	While true, you shouldn't eat more than about 90g a day on average and alot of people exceed that in one meal. Hell, I did this morning and I regret it.
t1_dtvtu8u	0	*	Are you arguing that meat doesn't have *any* other value than taste?  ..or are you putting words in my mouth?
t1_dtw64sw	0	*	Lmfao okay you can't distinguish what you do and what buddy in the article did huh? Protein powder is not cheaper than B grade meat. Keep pretending (or living in a different area). 
t1_dtvf56h	0	*	you have misinterpreted this thread. I am arguing against hunting for sport. 
t1_dtwixpx	0	*	Making a difference in the conservation of animals, but Not necessarily dying people in Africa> not making any difference in either of these areas
t1_dtwfl8d	0	*	Thanks trollaccount!
t1_dtwnaab	1	*	You clearly havent met our good friends corporations and civilization. Theyre a fan of land thats habitable 
t1_dtw2cc6	0	*	But you believe genetically weak animals intrinsically have less value. So why does the same not apply to humans?
t1_dtvu400	1	*	They are not given food or water whilst being transported to the slaughterhouse and this can take several days. 
t1_du6xzt5	0	*	you mean virile instead of virulent.    and I have been agreeing with you. it's frustrating. 
t1_dtvgqc3	0	*	If you think that killing rare, sentient species is fun for the hell of it that is definitely sociopathic and mentally ill.
t1_dtvdqrs	0	*	Is it moral to raise livestock in subpar conditions with the express intent of eating them when you don't need to consume them to survive?  It's just like, your opinion man
t1_dtvme72	0	*	Or you could just eat some beans or something, damn.
t1_dtvynvb	0	*	But we sure love are burgers and BBQs.  Necessary evil I think. 
t1_dtvmudm	0	*	Unless you're hunting...
t1_dtves6g	0	*	I think thats actually an amalgamation of a couple of scenes 
t1_dtvp3h5	1	*	Lol. Maybe you should stop breathing, I think Donald trump junior is an advocate for it.
t1_dtvfz1n	0	*	So you are saying that animals who do not eat meat have smaller brains when you say bigger brains need more vitamin b?
t1_dtvlmy3	1	*	One person also makes huge difference because they can be a catalyst for change.
t1_dtvijl4	0	*	>extremely unsavoury behaviour.   But when the biologists get paid to kill the same animal its fine.  Youre struggling here because your position is untennabke nonesense.
t1_dtvqbax	0	*	Yay more extrajudicial killings! You realize many of the poachers poach because they have little other options to support their families? 
t1_dtvm4kx	0	*	That actually looks disgusting. I'm glad meat is available.
t1_dtvif3h	0	*	So you steal it? Because you certainly don't hunt.   Youre a joke. Look inward to see why.
t1_dtwen27	0	*	No, my argument is that humans are stubborn beings who aren't going to change their habits no matter how self righteous you are.
t1_dtvpc6u	1	*	something to read: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/hunting-big-game-why-people-kill-animals-for-fun/
t1_dtvkljk	0	*	It doesnt matter to the chicken whether you killed it for food or a trophy; its still just as dead.
t1_dtviuwp	0	*	Yeah but preemptively judging people based on immediately presented facts is reddit's thing.  
t1_dtvfe3v	0	*	What are you doing here? If you can't recite every line of dialog from Always Sunny you need to get back to rewatching!
t1_dtvebwt	0	*	Their deaths serve a purpose.   Let them live and they do nothing to help their species thrive.  Your morality is more cruel for these animals overall then death is.
t1_dtvgt4p	0	*	But, but, how do you think conservation is paid for?
t1_dtvfrs7	1	*	well same here, my granma lives with 2500kn, and she is not hungry or something
t1_dtvfyoj	1	*	And doesn't the old man have a penchant for some form of bed-wetting too, or is that only when he's in Russia ? 
t1_dtvgg6l	0	*	What movie is that? I wanna watch it.
t1_dtvnvb2	0	*	Where's your data? Where's your data with evidence of who the money goes to?
t1_dtvob10	1	*	This is more US politics with two parties infecting online discourse. You don't get this shit in places with more then 2 parties. 
t1_dtvgusi	0	*	Some psychopaths kill animals for fun as kids, it's one of the warning signs basically. No empathy for anything
t1_dtw0wti	0	*	How about I sell tickets to hunt you? Ill donate the proceeds to orphans. Thats for the greater good, isnt it?
t1_dtvqs0d	1	*	so youre saying these hunters are no smarter than lions? 
t1_dtvmub5	0	*	Animals are not supposed to be starved before slaughter. But meatpackers can work faster and with less care if the intestines are empty. So there is an inherent, andvery perverse incentive in place.
t1_dtvmg0v	1	*	watch Earthlings on Youtube.
t1_dtvmi3v	0	*	They aren't fed in the last 24 hours or so,  so there is no feces when they're killed. Also probably because it is a waste of money to feed them when they are about to die. You are an idiot. 
t1_dtwxumc	1	*	Wouldn't know, I quit a couple of years ago thanks to the complaints I just mentioned 
t1_dtvefa7	1	*	**#The money**
t1_dtvruha	0	*	its called a joke u dweeb
t1_dtvg5jk	1	*	Im not saying thats not the case with many companies, but they normally dont work to destroy their own business model. 
t1_dtvg418	0	*	How many people need such a protein rich diet?
t1_dtvjokp	0	*	It's very rare that the rancher has to do anything to help conserve a wild animal.
t1_dtvj0my	1	*	>im blocking you.   Well everyone, this is what happens when someone is so averse to facts.   Edit: and they still downvoted this.  Guess blocking is hard. Lol what a clown.
t1_dtvjfw0	1	*	South Africa takes anti-poaching pretty seriously 
t1_dtvgnss	0	*	I have a friend who can quote every scene from Trailer Park Boys and Always sunny. It's impressive.

t1_dtvp6ls	0	*	Dude chicken little tho
t1_dtvjznd	0	*	Even if humans suddenly didnt want rhino horns or any of that, civilizations would encroach into these areas and kill the animals because theyre in the way. 
t1_dtvpkjl	1	*	Watch food inc and see if you want to eat anything you usually buy at the store anymore. And then theres fast food. Terrifying....
t1_dtvicp8	1	*	That's not what I'm talking about and you know it. Let's no build up straw men here.
t1_dtvkwcl	1	*	I saw the movie about her and the cow insights was interesting. If we lived a day as a production animal, what would we take home from that? 
t1_dtvp6xd	0	*	Why not? Fuck the premise that it's inherently a net negative, prove your damn assertion and I'll offer a rebuttal. Until then, define your damn terms.
t1_dtvf8iv	0	*	Do you have more info on these fines for wasting meat? Never heard of them before.   Edit: Googling gets me a ton of results about chronic wasting disease, and I haven't had coffee yet.
t1_dtvzxaw	1	*	The egotism is in deciding that exploitation is preferable to symbiosis.
t1_dtvn8rf	0	*	Ok, true for parts of US and Europe. Doesn't mean soy isn't a big food source for cattle.
t1_dtw017u	0	*	Maybe you'd care more about me if I were an orange retard? You seem to like those
t1_dtwqwf6	1	*	Two film series at that.
t1_dtvkyfo	1	*	But do you hate cows? 
t1_dtvjhtz	0	*	Children can't treat their diseases.
t1_dtvumw5	1	*	There are ton of animated films like listed here with farm animals and they are common in tv shows and kids picture books. The difference is that they are not raised for meat, not advertising.
t1_dtvrend	1	*	maybe they think it is? you're allowed to have a different opinion.
t1_dtvjs92	0	*	> you would have no problem with farming elephants for their meat and horns?  That's how it is already in many asian countries. They eat dogs.
t1_dtvmmx0	0	*	Leather seats are still a luxury though. For their practical purpose, you'll be perfectly fine with cloth or vinyl seats.
t1_dtvjq50	1	*	And often get in the way of becoming rich.
t1_dtvh192	0	*	Fair point. I just get frustrated when people judge others very harshly for hunting but dont think twice about factory farming.
t1_dtvmunf	0	*	The movie Chicken Run really upset me as a kid.  *bites into chicken drumstick*
t1_dtvsl7r	1	*	Every animal is confined in one way or another by natural features. If that's the case, then no hunting is ethical, because all animals are trapped.
t1_ds394ny	0	*	So write off my 1st hand experience because I hit a sore point that you were insinuating? 
t1_ds28p70	1	*	Also, I think I clearly state that the theme of self declared benevolent rule is consistent to empires generally, so your analogy doesnt really pertain to my statement.
t1_ds3hpxq	0	*	Well it's an offer they can't seem to refuse... obviously.
t1_ds3dyy3	1	*	LOL. So now you downgraded your source to a 'Good Window'?
t1_du8hdmb	0	*	It was german culture at the time that led to their rise. The Middle East in particular is all the proof thats needed. They arent all equal when the people arent.
t1_dtjoypa	0	*	That's how I got my information.  I have a bachelors in environmental engineering, so I know many people in this field.  Why, what's your expertise?  
t1_duvkbg8	0	*	Dude needs a thesaurus
t1_duvrq2a	0	*	Animal shit is fine though. Humans are exposed to much different chemicals than a wild animal.
t1_duvsfm3	1	*	Yeah he does that in most of his videos. They're good to watch though to see all the interesting foods in asia.
t1_duvtwn0	1	*	I could take it or leave it
t1_duvbkrc	0	*	Dude seriously you try way too hard with your teenager mentality to change the world, go there and see for yourself, then talk again.
t1_duvce3k	1	*	Rail ties; biohazards across the globe! IIRC the human waste hitting the rails makes the trains go faster. Lubed lightning!
t1_duvjl7b	0	*	Yeah Im not sure how that happens honestly. I think its because they vote R due to crossover wedge issues. Growing up rural and living the environment I think is only tangentially related to R Magic. 
t1_duvfh62	0	*	What I mean is you guys could put a positive spin on anything.  Nation of friendly spoken PR execs.
t1_duvu15e	0	*	I understand the difference between feet and miles, **feet and miles** have *shades of meaning* (of a fashion).  But Length and Distance do not have shades of meaning.  
t1_duvqo47	0	*	That's pretty uncommon nowadays but yeah it does happen.  Source: dislike Milan

t1_duva594	0	*	They're lentils. Probably the largest units in which they can obtain the lentils.  
t1_duvm4gi	0	*	The forest animals probably aren't all shitting along the same path and they hopefully aren't on anti-depressants or birth control.
t1_duvnka8	0	*	Several of the YouTube foodies I follow always do that same HMMMMMMMMMMWOOOOW thing.  If everything is amazing, nothing is.
t1_duvp7vm	1	*	Enjoy shitting more water than you piss! Mmmmmmmmmmmmm.
t1_dtl51bo	0	*	Every single country on earth has corruption. But only a handful can shrug it off and keep going unfazed by it. Some institutionalize it like Russia and the U.S.

t1_ds3hja2	0	*	I hate to reply to this, but hey.. Mirror, mirror:  >Lil neckbeardbaby gotta have the last word, adorable.
t1_ds49v21	1	*	As compared to a globalized apocalypse event caused by man, that would seem to be a bit of a trade-off in probabilities and time scales.
t1_ds3h9q2	0	*	This guy is an actual stereotype and it's great to see one in the wild.
t1_dsw3df6	0	*	What are two separate businesses? what is a business? 
t1_du6cx33	0	*	Okay, girl. Just know that when you die the world is going to take a collective sigh in relief. Im going to go back to being rich and helping people now though. Talk to you later. *waves* 
t1_dsia3ov	0	*	Some sounds like more than the 1 example for the US. More there and less here.
t1_dsi34ar	1	*	That needs addressed. You're right though
t1_dsi8oga	1	*	>they get buried...  Right...but you don't?
t1_duq4gqh	0	*	governed by who? just let Israel have it and have a little vatican city for every major religion make it like Rome 
t1_dux61gp	0	*	Well at least that lets me know that there is no evidence that you will accept.   Now I know not to waste time trying to use facts and evidence to convince you of things.
t1_du5zmxx	1	*	also freedom of speech should be controlled, censorship is important to control the population from saying certain things
t1_dsktymk	0	*	I'm not trans, totally cool with them, but are you projecting? You don't have to hate an entire group because of your own internalized self-hatred.
t1_dslmmq9	1	*	well she passed away a while ago so it would be impossible to say anything around her
t1_du700jh	0	*	Theyre so isolated I think it barely matters to ordinary people if they get to sell coal to China or not. Money from such sales werent going to wages!
t1_du7xiy5	0	*	If you think North Korea had any intention of liberating anyone, you are sadly in need of a history lesson.
t1_du7bm00	1	*	Ok good
t1_du6tsmh	1	*	> Keep your idealistic fantasy to yourself  The fuck are you even talking about? What idealistic fantasy have I proposed? 
t1_dsk1kge	1	*	This is what people fail to realize. 3d printing isn't meant for mass production, but its a very versatile method. 
t1_dsjj61b	1	*	No of course I agree with what you are saying but that wasn't my point.
t1_dsjts9k	0	*	it just drops a chemical weapon that is oderless and colorless that kills anyone who inhales it of course 
t1_dsjw4z5	0	*	Not sure if you were just trying to be funny, but it kind of came off as you missing the point.
t1_dsjmqwe	1	*	OHHHHHHHHHHHH I see what you mean. I guess when someone says  'drop mortar rounds' my brain goes right back to the old place. :) Cheers!
t1_dsjxfd5	1	*	Bullet avoidance will be even harder.
t1_dslvo3e	0	*	Depends on the turret and the size of the base. This [turret](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter_Rocket,_Artillery,_and_Mortar) would probably be able to take on 100 drones.  
t1_dsjfpke	1	*	Someone already explained this better than I did in reply. 
t1_dsdtc8x	0	*	Interesting, that's similar to what they do in Vietnamese as well. Hai = 2, Muoi = 10, Hai moui = 20.    
t1_dse35yl	1	*	Meh, lazy day
t1_dupr7sy	1	*	Yeah your right. There is not really a good solution.
t1_dup8huw	1	*	We did not choose oligarchy 
t1_duoyj15	1	*	you are a seriously sick and anti-Semitic individual to suggest the Holocaust is anywhere remotely on par with Arpaio's jails

t1_dunty4z	0	*	for the most part - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_strategy

t1_dunnaim	1	*	Ironic
t1_dunwpx3	0	*	You're clearly a master of logical gymnastics so there's no need to continue this further. You're obviously not reading our responses fully.  Enjoy your fairyland! :)
t1_dunmq7c	1	*	It doesn't sound like he's advocating for it, just advocating against it at a lower priority than other concerns.
t1_dunsg1k	0	*	You just described the other side perfectly. The ones that are in power and running everything. 
t1_duoz2ev	0	*	'Tis a quote by Agent Kay from the movie Men in Black. There, I've attributed it. 
t1_duo7ddh	0	*	It seems he's charismatic to a particular group of people
t1_dunqivw	0	*	And a few hundred years ago, owning people didn't violate any human rights. We shouldn't base arguments on legality, many laws are only to protect the upper class. 
t1_duootgr	0	*	The democratic party shouldnt cater to the wishes of their voter base and instead work towards their own interest? Is that what you are saying?  The   DEMOCRATIC  Party?
t1_dunktme	0	*	Bernie Sanders
t1_dunljuo	1	*	Not my beef but honestly I think they were not directing that at you, I think they used 'you' as an imaginary/hypothetical example.
t1_dunu604	1	*	Yes, because they hate free speech 
t1_duoyj6k	0	*	you are a seriously sick and anti-Semitic individual to suggest the Holocaust is anywhere remotely on par with Arpaio's jails

t1_dunv54n	0	*	It wasn't about the broken english, as a non american i don't care about that, i just found it gunny that you vall your job as a professional troll data scientist 
t1_dunprkf	1	*	also be careful to not misinterpret it
t1_dunqdb4	0	*	Point proven. To the max.
t1_dunmx9q	0	*	Yea I said all things aside. This is about you and your garbage argument. I don't even disagree with you. 
t1_dunqxam	1	*	Maybe some people don't share your view on human rights. 
t1_dunnpnh	1	*	There are nicer ways to ask for sources that don't assume the commenter is intentionally lying.
t1_dupvgb1	1	*	No.
t1_duotzi9	0	*	Do you know why they're required to expire after 10 years?
t1_dunox53	1	*	How else are you supposed to know you are in the right if you don't entertain the idea that you might be wrong.
t1_duppam8	1	*	 I never mentioned illegal immigrants. You added that.  You misunderstood or ignored the point of the example.  
t1_dunz5dj	0	*	Well I'm talking about lying, aka saying things that aren't true. You're arguing he doesn't do this?
t1_dunoucb	1	*	Then please clarify because it sounds like you said they don't qualify as free press because they don't tell whatever you consider to be the truth.  
t1_dunphp1	0	*	No, I expect what I said to be something a person does for themselves to clear the insult and reaffirm before committing the same kind of slander back and looking like a fool.
t1_dsgalcr	0	*	Unless the power used to charge said electric powered car comes from a coal fire power plant.
t1_dsgf4by	1	*	4.25 times, but China uses well under half the amount of electricity per capita.  China uses 5,900 TWh per year, the US uses 4,100 TWh per year.
t1_dtu3wr3	1	*	China has their own aircraft carriers for that. These islands are forward operating bases. Maybe even icebergs the more I read. I mean you only see 10% of the mass. Could be underground stuff.
t1_duyn22v	0	*	Currently the Prime Minister of Canada is stating this was an Indian conspiracy to make him look bad.  He has gone before parliament and stated as such.
t1_dtlk5v6	1	*	Either way, I found his answer helpful in clarifying. 
t1_du5316b	0	*	One is worse, is it not?
t1_du20pgp	1	*	Not everyone has a chance to get more than minimum wage 
t1_dt31c97	0	*	I did. But call it null and void or without any legal validity if you feel picky about the terminology. It doesnt change a bit the fact that Israel cant unilaterally annex territory beyond its own. 
t1_dt353rx	0	*	Meh. You seem interesting.
t1_dt31ff3	1	*	Crazy ol world we got goin huh
t1_dt3t88d	0	*	No they do not, something having been Israeli terratory thousands of years ago according to religious texts do not a legitimate claim make.
t1_dtq0x2u	1	*	Fine I admit it, I took the cookie from the cookie jar.
t1_dttay71	0	*	> Our basic charge without having to do any advanced/invasive treatment is $350  What a wonderfully Christian society.
t1_dtuegzr	0	*	You can't demand these things. Everyone should receive the same medicine and wait the same amount of time. It's a common sense.
t1_dttbaoy	0	*	You cunts charge the patient by the amount of distance you have to travel? That's just beyond evil
t1_dttf301	0	*	Please give me an example of communism ever actually working correctly? I'll wait. Democracy is not without it's flaws, but it's better than veiled dictatorships.
t1_dtti4xf	1	*	Eh, mostly. Look up pledge of allegiance on YouTube, its kinda creepy. But it is optional though, at least in my school
t1_dttn6ak	1	*	That is simply false
t1_dtter20	0	*	Well, we pledge allegiance to the flag every morning.   So basically, yeah. 
t1_dttl478	1	*	this thread is heavier than I wanted at 8 am.

t1_dttcr6d	1	*	That's fucking awful. Glad you got through it.

t1_dtvl5o6	0	*	I think we are in agreement in principle in not in some specifics.
t1_dttj3rz	1	*	xa3200k gets you a ton more. Quicker pay off from medical education bills, quicker investments into house and retirement funds. 
t1_dttm57c	0	*	Notice that all those messages come from people in power, and not from the layman 
t1_dttt3nu	1	*	Of course I'm close minded because universal healthcare is the only answer and every other country had proven it.
t1_dttrwyt	1	*	Yes.  Small loan.  About a million.  
t1_dtthoip	0	*	Overly expensive treatment is also not covered in some cases where it is more 'experimental', not just homeopathy.
t1_dttbx61	0	*	Keep dreaming man, the propaganda is deep rooted into the psyche of millions of Americans. Fox news has done so much damage to the U.S. and by extension the world. 
t1_dtu47hq	1	*	Such as forcibly taking resources from other countries just like every other superpower in history has done.
t1_dttlfc5	0	*	American here . Whats this public daycare you speak of ? I pay $17,700 a year for 2 kids.
t1_dtwbmdd	0	*	If that was true you would have said that in your reply to him.  You can't just say something irrelevant and then say, Well he was irrelevant first
t1_dtu9768	1	*	well technically  the fine would be, initial fee+admin fee+ costs. so yeh really it is. /s
t1_dttsweo	0	*	You do realise competitive means someone other than the one party in government gets to compete right? 
t1_dttc909	0	*	What are you arguing? Specialised care can be privatised? So? It can also NOT be privatised and it can still be offered through universal healthcare and paid for using taxes.
t1_dttywto	1	*	That's rough. Shit dude, come to Ireland. We got some alright jobs, though the price of beer and rent here will make you hate us
t1_dtthz01	0	*	No public daycare and preshcool? That's weird. I knew that the US introduced public schools to us when they got us as a colony.

t1_dttcu22	0	*	I know it's hard for you to understand, but a coherent worldview actually requires knowledge and effort. 
t1_dttmu85	1	*	It does, but only in ideal conditions. Even in countries with free Healthcare a lot of people go to the doctor not when the symptoms occur, but when they are unbearable. 
t1_dttswnt	1	*	No offense but most Americans are idiots.  I've made about $500 on my credit card so far, 0 debt. But that's because I use it as a debit card instead of spending beyond my means like most people.
t1_dttzk1j	0	*	When Im talking to someone who compares by analogy an ideology that resulted in the deaths of 90 million people, and windows vista, the conversation is over.

t1_dtte6tp	0	*	So they got numbers from a few places in London and thats your argument?   Bollocks. 
t1_dttt0m0	1	*	But it won't be a fault of the NHS. 
t1_dttkmwf	0	*	Which still doesn't make them free.  By your logic an absolute monarchy is free because the leader is a person.
t1_dttct3a	0	*	Oh man I'm sorry. Where do you live if you don't mind me asking. 
t1_dttbiol	0	*	Sure, but most people see urgent care as a ghetto version of a hospital, at least all the people I've talked to about it.  Besides, I tried to go to one once, it was 6pm and they were closed.
t1_dttkju7	1	*	Yeah, a state-issued drivers license is good enough for domestic flight (including technically overseas places like alaska, hawaii, USVI, PR)
t1_dttqw4h	0	*	California has Disneyland so we win by default. Meanwhile Russia is ruled by an autocrat that kills his opposition and journalists.
t1_dtttnmr	0	*	There's an argument here about mandatory participation here that some will overlook.

t1_dttfh1n	1	*	Ouch oof
t1_dttmzek	1	*	Ahh. Gotcha, yeah, but they'll learn. I've been poor my whole life and these people are voting themselves into it. I think it's a bit funny, but also pretty scary. 
t1_dttjece	0	*	No. I am a white kartoffel guy who does zero sports.

t1_dttxjq4	1	*	In that it tried to address the problem with no productive input from the right, definitely.  In that it is a good bandaid?  Heck no.
t1_dtvtskg	1	*	This started from you attempting to explain why being poor is a choice (see above). I'm not putting words in your mouth, simply saying your argument is too simple. 
t1_dttd7ut	0	*	???  There are no guns involved. You're coming across as completely deluded, mate.
t1_dttd5y0	0	*	We'll let the public democratic process of votes and up votes decide who's being irrational. 
t1_dttjn3s	0	*	Wait what...there are all these things lol. 
t1_dttigrr	1	*	Ues, teachers get pissed off if you dont, as if America were so perfect it deserved daily woship. Our country has always been a little full of itself.

t1_dttp8vr	1	*	You absolute cock, now I can't stop hearing my internal monologue.
t1_dtu32qs	1	*	I'm sure it varies significantly between different states/counties. In my hometown it's like $500-1500 iirc.
t1_dttuye7	1	*	Shit, that's more like the plan for when I turn 40 and nothing has improved
t1_dttg229	1	*	TIL the word numpty without having to look it up because I have reading comprehension. 
t1_dttbshi	0	*	You havent shown me any? I showed you one.  And how much will i pay? I cant afford insurance.
t1_dtull5a	1	*	also the royalty really doesn't control anything, parliament deals with business
t1_dtyh69t	1	*	Condition 18: Embryos have more rights than children.  Condition 19: Lead water is good for your children and embryos.  Condition 20: Don't want lead water? What are you, a socialist?
t1_dttcc1r	0	*	You're so worried about them you're okay with screwing over the vast majority for their sake. Such a man of the rare/uncommon deseases people!
t1_dttf7co	0	*	I'm broke as well, but less broke, send me your PayPal and I'll send you a fiver too. 
t1_dttdnw5	1	*	That's capitalism. Money begets money at the expense of all but power.
t1_dtvaapz	0	*	This was in all cases combined enrollment although a quick glance over the ivies shows numbers in the 20-25% range is the norm leaving Carnegie Mellon as a significant outlier yet again.
t1_dttcu0l	0	*	And I'm back to listen to the musical again for the next 5 weeks. Thank you....
t1_dttqws5	0	*	Have you stopped beating your wife yet?
t1_dttirlo	0	*	Lottery wins are taxed in the US iirc
t1_dttehfk	1	*	Give me a break, how is Cambridge astronomically beyond Harvard or Yale? 
t1_dttiuzy	1	*	I am a white german guy living in Neukxf6lln. Bad part. Had a bad encounter once. Years ago. No weapon involved. 
t1_dtth0ly	0	*	Condition 18: Don't retire-no social security.
t1_dtticpy	0	*	I hate to say it but until recently we did have 3 homeopathy hospitals, but i think they finally got closed down or are being closed down.
t1_dttm99a	0	*	Man, you really just can't wait to shoehorn your hate for black people into unrelated topics. Not going to even acknowledge other absurd bs you wrote. 
t1_dttc5kx	0	*	Not the point.
t1_dttvspn	0	*	Nobody said anything about race, dude.  Guilty conscience or something?
t1_dtu3hiy	1	*	When your family gets old and asks for help tell them to pull themselves up by their bootstraps and stop being lazy/a leech.
t1_dttcl1t	1	*	Or that you will wait forever for X treatment. You mean how is have to wait anyway? 
t1_dttx7gk	0	*	Are you serious? A man in the UK recently died because he couldnt afford to take time off to see a doctor. If anything, the UK is just as bad as the US when it comes to hypercapitalism.
t1_dttheto	1	*	Soviet Union playing the long con.
t1_dtv5puz	1	*	Yes. Try and work it out.
t1_dujfezs	1	*	Absolute bollocks
t1_dtv8th6	1	*	Quokkas. They're adorable and happy and all that is pure in the world until humans hurt them.
t1_dtv157r	0	*	Youre hilarious and dont understand how a free market works. 
t1_dttcu2e	0	*	Choose I didnt realize aging was a choice, or that getting cancer was a choice.  Needing access to healthcare is a choice like breathing is a choice.
t1_dtzgi8t	1	*	I call it wanting what is best for you and your family. 
t1_dttxcx0	0	*	Yeah, I have sent out hundreds of resumes before I found the job I have. It's tough. Good luck to you my man!
t1_dtthomx	0	*	Which was itself a Danish interpretation of the Anglo-Saxon name 'Eoforwic'.. And that was likely based on the the Roman 'Eboracum'.
t1_dttfdic	0	*	Also, if you dont stand for a song people call you ungrateful and suggest you dont like the freedoms that are allowed to you by the man. 
t1_dus22pr	1	*	Nice attempt at deflecting.  Won't work.  I know better than you. 
t1_duoqtfq	0	*	I know this is difficult for someone  like you whose brain turned to mush after years of watching CNN but try to think of why would someone not watch mainstream news. 
t1_dur6f22	0	*	*luck
t1_duorv9b	0	*	> His record of tunnel-vision and terrible management practices is well-known  Are they, really? Then why didn't Trump do anything about that instead of just taking him on for more corrupt fun?
t1_duopiw7	0	*	Come on. Use your head. 
t1_dup4x20	1	*	He'd probably end up looking like Hal.
t1_duothnw	0	*	>Good people dont act that way.  Then why do you? 
t1_duotbsf	0	*	Oh, so we're judging people by their past then?
t1_duptzqh	0	*	Like Miami Beach
t1_du3ku0r	1	*	Again it isn't that simple there's different minimum wages across the EU and different cost of living. So somebody from Bulgaria would benefit alot more from the same amount than someone in Sweden
t1_du4k9sd	0	*	Except housing costs have risen way above anything theyve been before proportionally. What happens when it becomes mathematically impossible to pay for the essentials?
t1_dtdztj6	1	*	Fuck off with this sarcastic deflection because you have no real purpose for spewing your shit but you want to feel included 
t1_dtexcai	0	*	This comment is incredibly vague, bro. Wtf are you talking about?
t1_dtdumat	0	*	> You can become insanely rich in the west without being corrupt.  Oh sweet summer child
t1_dte6f6x	0	*	google the paradox of intolerance. Being mean to fascists isn't fascism. 
t1_dtdvjk0	0	*	>>Trump is a retard  >>He is ~~a~~ ~~mastermind~~ planning to destroy the country  >Pick one.
t1_dte2oz0	0	*	I'd love to see a source on this, because it sounds like absolute bollocks. 
t1_dtdz4nx	0	*	Oh believe me, I know. I followed the case for a while and went to several vigils for Cameron.
t1_dtdysvh	1	*	Don't forget the MOAB
t1_dtfww2u	1	*	I didn't cite Kinsey. I specifically said it's high. 
t1_dtdwxe5	0	*	>the real world that sees Trump for the baboon he is  Which world do all his voters inhabit, if not the real world? 
t1_dtdz5t8	0	*	The 2000 bid was just a politcal hit job on the reform party organized by Roger Stone, he had no intention of actually running 
t1_dtdwnjj	1	*	Willful ignorance is bliss also I suppose. 
t1_dtdv0b7	0	*	Of course that's what I'm saying.  She was also the most honest candidate in her statements according to all the fact checking orgs during the primary and general election.
t1_dtf0vuf	1	*	- Auth. Left: Communism had a problem with food supply. - Lib. Right: Hates everything that makes 'society'. Roads, sewers, water, infrastructure, etc.
t1_dtdw67s	0	*	So because congress voted for those things I'm supposed to be on board with that when there was a canidate who didn't vote for those things?
t1_dte53my	0	*	Do you guys ever have a relevant retort or is it always just more whataboutism? 
t1_dtdwgz4	0	*	Sure! But I don't think the leftness of the dems was the reason behind Trump's success.
t1_dtedt6t	1	*	you read right through their comment and now mine. I mean this whole conversation is people talking through each other about generalizations but still.
t1_dte6oa0	1	*	Wait and see what happens to job growth in 2018 now that the tax cuts are in place.
t1_dteatcg	0	*	Having small homogenous population and territory helps. Just like any other instrument, democracy has spheres of application. It works in one enviroment, and doesn't work in others.
t1_dthg1ow	0	*	I mean I'm sure it seems that way to someone with your handle 
t1_dtebiai	0	*	Not Venezuela.
t1_dte501l	0	*	1991 != 2018
t1_dtdx11j	1	*	Sadly they will. Turning corrupt is easy, and all have to do is give the appearance of not being corrupt.  I wish I had an easy answer. 
t1_dte7snf	1	*	Only if the threat is realistic, that still doesn't make it violent - just unprotected speech. 
t1_dte96s1	1	*	I'd say it's not always ethical, unfortunately.  Fuck morality. 
t1_dte09tl	0	*	Sadly, some morals become law.
t1_dtdx8tz	0	*	Nor should it be, really.  Think about, in the US, whose morals would take precedence. Not secular heathens...
t1_dtdyvjk	0	*	Your bias is showing.
t1_dte6xhu	0	*	I didnt call it a movement... and it happened 1 year ago.
t1_dtdwql2	0	*	How are your tax dollars going to pollute pristine wilderness?
t1_dtfv95u	0	*	until its leaked.
t1_dte28f1	0	*	If you're arguing that the vast majority don't approve I think you're very naive and or dishonest
t1_dte3172	1	*	Lol but libs always love to tout it. Trump also won all tax brackets above $50k/year and Hillary won those below.
t1_dtef5nn	1	*	And so, god looks down from the heavens and utters a single word. *No*.
t1_dte962t	0	*	You can keep quite all you want if you or a loved one get's shot over something innocent and/or preventable, but we rather not.
t1_dte0m8j	0	*	So your response is I know you are but what am I?  Thats brilliant. 
t1_dtec349	0	*	If I mansplain an opinion you don't agree with; are you going to call it harassment?
t1_dtfwwp3	1	*	I get that it's hard to think straight when you're this dumb and homophobic. But I never said Kinsey was right. 
t1_dtdzqp4	1	*	We didn't come up with universal healthcare, others did. 
t1_dte5k1m	1	*	I mean if we pooled our money together we could raise the amounts that lobbyists pay them but then lobbyists would just pay them more anyway. 
t1_dte34j8	0	*	Yeah, it's easy to hide your inability to back up any belief you have with trololol.  That way you don't actually have to stand for anything when you're confronted with your stupidity.
t1_dte5pg3	0	*	Interesting. Hopefully it's a policy that can be effectively enforced.   Also: you don't have to be such a douche. I was asking a question.
t1_dte4sd8	0	*	Are there transparent sources that examine his business investments over time? I've heard about his failures before, and would genuinely like to see the sources
t1_dte63qb	1	*	And will rubber-stamp anything the overly religious crowd puts on his desk.
t1_dsu8501	0	*	In that case, in my opinion, I could care less about what a criminals motives are.
t1_dsscb59	0	*	I dont need her CV to understand that Democratic voters chose Clinton over Sanders. 
t1_dt63d3l	1	*	That's my point exactly. Any actual tyrannical regimes simply kill them. They never win, they are only fodder for whoever wants to attack the powers that be.
t1_dt4icos	0	*	They support him for a number of ideological reasons
t1_dt58pyr	0	*	I bet you have me all figured out.
t1_duengfy	0	*	No mental gymnastics. Equally large part of those countries are in those territories. <2%. Those are the numbers, how is that gymnastics? 
t1_dsvi8lg	1	*	https://www.google.com.au/amp/s/www.haaretz.com/amp/israel-news/.premium-1.833157
t1_dsufiza	1	*	The Nazis lost so obviously they are not justifying them. 
t1_dsv42v2	1	*	The Likkud party (current PM party), with its origins being the Irgun terrorist organization.  Just food for thought.
t1_dsuib39	1	*	To be completely honest, yes. The Jews likely wont ever be caught without a big stick and as every nation ever with attempting to expand their borders and holdings. 
t1_dsv5fhv	1	*	That would be a good thing. Thats what you want. Having an occupation removes responsibility from Palestinians because they are living under Israeli oppression and exploitation. 
t1_dsuwm3c	1	*	Im a 30 year old man. If I throw rocks I actually deserve to go to prison.  Thats the point Im trying to make.
t1_dsuyt1h	1	*	Well Jerusalem is their capital.
t1_dsuhmej	0	*	I concur completely. Self-defense is exactly what Israel did when the rest of the Arab world tried to illegally invade and steal its land multiple times.
t1_dsuxdk3	0	*	What other reason do you think Palestinians dont have a state? 
t1_dt0rxlk	1	*	Yeah, God forbid you act in a not so kind way to an occupying force that's killed members of your family and shot your cousin in the face only hours earlier.  
t1_dsukzpz	1	*	And were one third of the population.
t1_dv05q5h	0	*	lol
t1_dugz84o	0	*	You are the poster boy for the democrats we all love to hate.  Congrats.
t1_dsbw1zb	1	*	Its a strong argument.  I mean if you go back far enough the French are the Germans, as a people the Germanics are definitely the right answer. 
t1_dsa6iwy	0	*	Ultimately it does is democracies , the head of the US armed forces is the president right? Who is selected by the public to act on their behalf 
t1_dsa7ydv	0	*	Like I have a problem with that? 
t1_ds9kwx4	0	*	Hundreds of civilians died in each car bombing. They fire missiles at random into isreal.   They are a terror group. The UN even agrees it is.
t1_dsb78t3	1	*	Pretty much anyone who criticized him, like any other fascist.
t1_ds9l19t	1	*	I dont have to state that both sides are the same. They aren't. Presenting the opposite side of the argument=/= bias.
t1_ds9f21j	0	*	You should watch Lord of War 
t1_ds9ktt1	0	*	They have a jihad council and employ suicide bombers.  Bruh.
t1_dsa14mi	0	*	spreading information is a form of doing something   a far more valuable form of doing something than expecting every problem to be solved with violence
t1_ds9fmtq	1	*	The insistence on moral relativism is what gives room for atrocities to be committed. 
t1_ds9lz7s	0	*	*yawn*   No.
t1_dsa7zj2	0	*	You go on thinking whatever you want I don't particularly care and neithe do the facts
t1_ds9ra59	0	*	You don't know that but yeah it doesn't do much it's just a sticker. It's better than joining the us military that's for sure
t1_ds9lihn	0	*	I never said they were arabs, so I assume you are just poorly educated, every single one arab nation with anti colonialism ideology is ally to Iran, its a fact. 
t1_ds9fjbl	0	*	You see the word genocide or kill or anything like that in there? 
t1_dsa4f5h	0	*	Sure mate, it's like the nuclear weapons, does not have any hegemonic geo strategic value connotations at all, it's just iron and nuclear waste. Oil on the middle east? Nobody cares at all. LMAO
t1_dsal46t	1	*	Except they did help them as outlined in the 9/11 commission report. 
t1_ds9gb2q	0	*	It was a civilian organization, disarmed civilians, not militants nor officials.  Hezbollah killed disarmed civilians hiding and detonating a bomb, because that was their plan.
t1_ds9klxw	0	*	Good then extend the same courtesy to Palestinians
t1_dujnxk2	1	*	I'm a stranger, nothing wrong with his post.
t1_dujjvpa	0	*	I would say that's mental manipulation to gain the outcome they want. If someone said I will give you a sweets if you do the washing up, that's manipulation. Similar example.
t1_duicivz	0	*	Dude really wants to jump up your butt, man. 
t1_duqemdv	0	*	Hahahaha - even worse.  Like china, except your opinions matter even less and you have less people than nyc alone  
t1_dupkruu	1	*	No my country is the USA, it isnt special at all, in fact I am critical of my own country too. Nice try though. 
t1_duqbcid	0	*	Hmmm let's draw a picture of each other's prophets and see how that goes. 
t1_duqc1si	0	*	Yes, I fear the next Islamic terror attack. 
t1_duqhte5	1	*	No, rocks are not easy to side-step, and no, the protective gear they are wearing is against knife attacks, not against blunt force trauma.
t1_dupnjph	1	*	Right? THe next time a guy is running down an alley gun him down because he could be a threat.   Nevermind if he tries to get around you kill him anyway. Then beat his ass just for good measure
t1_dsn95l1	1	*	Why? Do you have the numbers from each country?
t1_dtd1v19	0	*	> Incorrect. I don't deny it to anyone who asks, and I can defend my position just fine.   On you go then.
t1_dtd21oa	1	*	Pseud's fucking corner? What are you like 70 years old
t1_dtbj69k	0	*	No, you're an [alt account.](https://www.reddit.com/user/alglesin) See you the next time you have to back yourself up in an argument, yeah?  Off you trot now.
t1_dtbsdgt	1	*	*smiles indulgently*
t1_dsptkin	0	*	Ok, I see where this is going so lets turn this around. Where did you get your education on this issue? What college/university course did you get your information from?  
t1_dumbo8z	0	*	Ok, never said they didnt.

t1_dseilji	0	*	You dont think these people knew their permits were temporary?  
t1_dsdyj9g	0	*	You must have a serious ideological problem with American tourists spending money abroad.
t1_dsf0x5b	0	*	Good. Are you going to personally kick them out or will you sit behind a keyboard and expect someone to do the heavy lifting for you? Enlist in ICE. They are hiring.
t1_dsdt17r	0	*	> and you are out of your mind if you think they are all employed and not using welfare.  Guess we should kick all the poor whites out too. Bunch of moochers.
t1_dse4wa8	0	*	WTF? I'm presuming you don't own anything that wasn't entirely designed and manufactured within your country then.
t1_dseog67	1	*	can they get residency? ( apart from investor green card / marriage)
t1_dsensp4	1	*	right.
t1_dsfm3kq	1	*	Basically yes. Just on a much shorter timeline. 
t1_dse8s6d	0	*	They can cancel the deal you made letting you stay on their lawn for a few weeks, and give you a few more weeks to get your affairs in order.
t1_dsegkg1	0	*	Nope it pretty accurately describes a lot of the thoughtless assholes commenting here.
t1_dsf4fm1	1	*	No one said anything about an obligation. It might sound crazy, but you can actually do things to help other people despite not being obligated to do so.
t1_dsdxm28	0	*	What people do with the money they earned is none of your concern!  If I want to send $1000 a month in donations to third world nations, are you going to whine about it?
t1_dumwhm7	0	*	Professionals are paid.
t1_dumv94x	0	*	Youre pushing again for more guns by undermining gun free zones. Theres this fear inside of you that you need to have a gun because someone is out to kill you.  Thats called paranoia.

t1_dt6f69l	0	*	I'd rather convert a Nazi than punch a Nazi.  That way the next Nazi I run across, I'll have someone by my side instead of facing two angry Nazis.
t1_dt6p20l	1	*	Ahhh, then I'd say you make a fair point.
t1_dt6nur2	0	*	The involves an act,a specific act which can be regualted in and if itself. We have a custom a s well. When men throw a woman  fire,w e hang them.

t1_dt6o4cb	0	*	As in someone literally made up a definition for a word that already had a definition.  An-archy is about doing away with governmental forms. Its literally without hierarchy.
t1_dt6pxhw	0	*	What is it, and how do you get it if nobody is there to give it to you? From who are you taking it?  And what happens if someone else decides they want it after you have it?
t1_dt64hyj	0	*	I don't agree 
t1_dum55st	1	*	Yeah what a bau5.
t1_dumef4k	0	*	Wait arguing i thought we were agreeing?  We came so far.

t1_dumy57f	0	*	facts are unbiased. but yeah, you can ignore them and follow your fake news happily.
t1_dummb9t	0	*	Are you somehow stressing that the Europeans had nothing to do with the wholesale genocide and exploitation of the African continent and somehow was justified in colonizing Africa the way it did? 
t1_dulrqje	0	*	Why are you avoiding his argument? Is it because you have no counter argument? You haven't disproved anything yet, and so far it looks like you're wrong
t1_dulxubh	0	*	Thanks for the compliment, but you are still very much useless.  I recommend trying something else.  Like not being useless.
t1_dulc728	0	*	More like you can't think of a single factual thing, and don't know a thing about Chinese involvement in Africa.
t1_dultux2	0	*	You said and I quote:  >TIL 2 wikilinks and an alternet link is considered quite a few  and now you are using some wiki BS without even a link to prove your point? the irony is real...

t1_du1e7ob	1	*	That's fair, but you're wrong, and here are 174 reasons why:
t1_du1i5n7	1	*	Agreed, Instagram was better before Facebook started trying to make Instagram more like Facebook.
t1_du1n7xu	1	*	Are you ok with using an add-on? [FBP](https://www.fbpurity.com/) has filters that target specifically what annoys you.
t1_dtwgkk5	1	*	You've spent the last three hours attacking your keyboard like an epileptic having a seizure because someone made a joke. It's a description, not an insult :)
t1_dtw5ew9	1	*	Clearly, that was a bad joke lol
t1_duid7gn	0	*	None of which refutes what OP said:  > North Korea invaded South Korea. They were the aggressors. Why they hate the US is really irrelevant to the topic at hand. 
t1_dui1g1j	0	*	Are you really basing your whole argument on a speech written for a monarch whose status became purely symbolical in an occupied country?  What a coincidence it completly fits the US narrative.
t1_duj3f4g	0	*	Oh yes, because my nationality means I agree with all my governments decisions on principle. 
t1_dt05g1b	0	*	I guess thats how schools end up woth police and metal detectors at the  doors. Must have been some scary shit.
t1_dsznprz	1	*	Of course, funny enough SSRIs have a similar effect to amphetamines for some ADHD patients so it'll help even though they're misdiagnosed. 
t1_dt96t6t	0	*	lol so much asspain it just keeps coming

t1_dso0hcf	1	*	You could even argue linearly if each bigger area did not contain the area before. d/dr r^2 = 2r.  But the major point is that I get triggered when people use exponentially incorrectly. :)
t1_dsn2us2	1	*	You would launch head to head, but advanced ICBMs have evasive maneuvers so it depends how advanced N. Korea ICBMs  It would be radar guided and radar guided missiles are cancer.

t1_duukqir	0	*	Yes, though as noted below all of those vessels are intended to survive their missions. Adding reactors to mines/torpedoes etc would be a whole different kettle of fish.

t1_dssmgvj	0	*	Only unbiased sources count now? I think as long as the bias is clear, making it possible for you to consider it into forming your opinion about the source, everything is game.

t1_dtcco8c	1	*	I think it should be pretty clear to you by now I'm not a liberal. Nor do I own a limousine.
t1_dtbq5x4	1	*	No I'm suggesting your comparison is ridiculous and that they should leave Israel alone with their invasion

t1_dtbcwcg	0	*	Human nature we are basically monkeys with better weapons, the only real miracle is how the fuck we've lasted so long. At this point I've lost all faith in our species.

t1_dsq5wcp	0	*	In what way?  You think fewer people should treat this as a case of a kid lying and more people should treat it as evidence that Muslims are untrustworthy?
t1_dsq999a	1	*	And change your name. And explain why you have no history of school or work under your current name, etc.  
t1_dsr7g68	0	*	Yeah just like how both sides were at fault in Charlottesville?   *Think*, people, it's not that hard.

t1_dsqatbq	1	*	They restrict ID's?
t1_dsqk5q6	0	*	Uh, yeah people have evidence for what happened because it's what happened, you racist fucks are the ones presenting your own twisted version of reality with literally no evidence
t1_dsqgb15	0	*	You keep linking that article, but it doesn't answer the question, what prevents them from getting an ID?
t1_dsqdb9g	0	*	I'm not sure, and I just started hearing more about this very recently. All anecdotal evidence of course. 
t1_dsv5qff	1	*	Where has wikileaks ever claimed neutrality? Assange explicitly said he wanted to hurt Hillary's campaign by revealing damaging information.

t1_dsqi64p	0	*	It's not like he was running against Obama dude.
t1_dsqt8hx	1	*	I'm struggling to grasp exactly what it is you're saying I suppose.  You believe that there needs to be evidence to support a claim or you don't?
t1_dss8heo	1	*	Life long indoctrination starting at a young age is a very, very hard thing to break. especially if you don't want to seek the truth, but just blindly accept what the tv tells you
t1_dsr25w5	1	*	>Uh... Isn't a big part of journalism fact-checking  Judging by the last year, a journalist who does fact checking is called fake news by retards and then ignored.
t1_dsqg994	1	*	So minorities can't get those IDs? What's preventing them?
t1_dsqaclf	1	*	No my argument actually is reasonable since you're posting a top level comment in a news subreddit based on non-factual information.
t1_dt2vjg8	1	*	I dunno, hard to tell how much of that is genuine or put-on.
t1_dsqr3fd	0	*	Except that it does in the same way thay swastikas will always be equated with nazis and anti-Semitism.  Pretending otherwise is being willfully ignorant.

t1_dsq4wba	1	*	To be fair, his username is Albert the fuckwit.
t1_dsqsrxk	1	*	I think it is because Muslim immigrants have been screened. It is the policy of US after all to only largely accept skilled workers. 
t1_dsrayqn	0	*	Sounds good. Just don't want to see false memories passed off as fact for spectators to get confused. That's no better than fox news.
t1_dsqj9x3	0	*	If it was European it would be closer to xa315000
t1_dstxzx1	0	*	It is not a conspiracy or a grand scheme. It was a simple lie. A simple lie that led to police investigating a crime and wasting money and time. It never happened. It was a HOAX. 
t1_dsqd8nh	0	*	Maybe you shouldn't try defending the indefensible. 
t1_dsqf8z1	0	*	When more deaths are causes by vending machines it is a pretty low number. Why don't you rally around something that's actually FAR more likely to affect you and your family such as police brutality.

t1_dsq65fb	0	*	Hypothetically,  for the same reason as most of these hoaxes.  They would see it as a political gain.

t1_dsqijbu	0	*	Aside from housing a timer in a box and showing it to multiple people that all warned him about it.
t1_dsq9rxd	0	*	I didn't tell you anything did I? I'm just shocked (not that shocked really) you can't see that assuming what someone thinks and from that judging them having an inferior opinion is prejudiced.
t1_dsqbbvk	0	*	People are idiots though. You can't even put a backpack down without someone shrieking about it being a bomb.
t1_dsq8ki3	0	*	Just how tiny do you think a pencil is??
t1_dsqyzd4	1	*	From what it seems to us who freely and unhatefully use these labels, the real racists are the ones who hide behind ultra-sensitive language.

t1_dsqvpoi	0	*	Because the average joe knows what looks like an explosive...  It's a little worrying if you know that right off the bat.
t1_dsqm48j	0	*	Not if they have a GAL or the like with them. 
t1_dsqbjai	0	*	I meant her parents putting her in the naughty corner. Anything legal for this girl is ridiculous

t1_ds59q7q	0	*	No sir. And I have a nagging feeling neither have you.  
t1_ds6nbot	0	*	He worked with the CIA and compromised an already threatened polio campaign. You jail spies to prevent others from taking the same course.

t1_ds609k4	1	*	disagree all you'd like.  it is definitely the way things are now.
t1_ds573b6	1	*	Yeah and a lot of times there is little to no references or something is pulled from references with the wrong context and sometimes just straight manipulated. Wikipedia is not a primary source. 
t1_ds59fb5	0	*	Even if that were true it wouldn't make it right and you would be equating lack of marriage with a death penalty.
t1_ds5h718	0	*	Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof. The onus is on the exclaimer not the crowd to provide the proof. 
t1_ds73dua	0	*	I am not calling the Mexicans hypocrites.  So the wall's purpose is no different than that of the border fence with Mexico, or the one we currently have.  The problem for you is the scale of it?  
t1_dsztqxe	1	*	Wrap it up folks. Were done here.
t1_dsz9p1m	0	*	What a load of shit.   How can someone go around making such asinine claims like that and the media just feeds him the coverage
t1_dsz2ng2	1	*	> you used this obvious minority to paint a picture of all liberals  Umm, what? I never said anything even remotely close to that.
t1_dv5l4e9	0	*	Cant derail the conversation, so attack the person until they go away. Im sure you get paid well.

t1_dsoqniq	1	*	Ah that makes sense
t1_dsorsf2	0	*	Fascinating. I knew you would not answer the question but I didn't expect this method of anger. Now go away forever, racist sympathizer. Killfiled.
t1_dsoqln7	0	*	You already lost the argument... why are you embarrassing yourself further?
t1_dtsdns8	1	*	So you support the stabbing of illegal immigrants at will? Ok then. 
t1_dtsnqnb	1	*	So in your opinion, illegal immigrants don't only deserve to be stabbed to death, but are actually the *real* terrorists. Gotcha.
t1_dtsafz1	0	*	> They guy was an illegal immigrant.  Technically he was a war criminal, actively participating in and benefiting from purposeful violations of the Geneva Conventions.
t1_dt1t92g	0	*	Protest literally anywhere else? Perhaps a sidewalk, even better if it's small and you make a line miles long down it. Perhaps outside a police department or etc?
t1_dt18o7b	0	*	it's a comment board, not a doctoral dissertation. you understand the point i am making which applies to autocracy and one party rule just the same
t1_dt1hyf5	1	*	You need 60 votes to pass a budget - even though the republicans have a majority, they still need some dems to vote with them to end the shutdown.   So now basically both sides are blaming the other. 
t1_dt1ejt6	0	*	And the fact they should have invaded after they refused to give up Bin Laden.

t1_dt1nvj3	0	*	The Scandinavian countries are not socialist. They capitalist countries with more social policies than some other capitalist countries. They are not at all close to being socialist countries.
t1_dt1cxsw	0	*	If you're such an unlikable person that folks resorted to voting for Trump over you, then you're unqualified as far as I'm concerned.
t1_dt1liz4	0	*	Tone is really hard to read over the internet. I think it also speaks poorly of the times that I cant tell if people are joking about killing the first amendment or not anymore.
t1_dt3mwt8	1	*	Well I have a tutor and a chinese girlfriend and most people here in Guangzhou dont speak very good English so Ive caught on quite a bit. The HelloChinese app is really good too :)

t1_dt1c4jv	0	*	Are you just spitting out buzzwords?
t1_dt1g9ta	0	*	But the question of, if an ethnic cleansing or genocide is underway, do you think there is no justification for intervention? Do you think the UN bombing of Syria was unjustified?

t1_dt1eokt	0	*	FUCK YOU I WON'T DO WHAT YOU TELL ME! MOTHERFUCKER! AARGH!
t1_dt1kjb8	1	*	Right? Mr Smith Goes to Washington makes contemporary filibusters seem tame as all hell 
t1_dt1q52y	1	*	Yeah, seriously, the prime minister has more power in parlimentary systems than the president does in our system, at least in regards to being able to directly pass and influence legislation. 
t1_dt9mwdi	0	*	The economy is poor because it's capitalist. It's been over 2 decades, what it is now is capitalism's fault. 
t1_dt3ypnl	0	*	How to tell someones only read anti-communist propaganda 101.
t1_dt1z89l	1	*	Ironic since US imprisons more of its population than like any nation on Earth. 
t1_dt1n1vp	1	*	I said overall, not every step of the way nor did I say it's perfect.
t1_dt2z2i0	0	*	Amendment via Congress  Amendment via National Convention (unlikely, though if a convention does occur I bet this will be a huge part of the debate)  Overruling by Supreme Court
t1_dt1clzr	0	*	Reality. She was corrupt and untrustworthy. Dems would've done way better with Sanders. 
t1_dt19bgh	1	*	You're welcome, bud. Have a good google of it. And remember that China still imprisons and disappears people advocating for democracy today. And they even kidnapped book sellers from other countries!

t1_dt1b2ns	0	*	Did you know that in China, you can't even own a house?
t1_dt1ecd7	1	*	The Chinese are unique in the regard that their ancestors were Chinese.  Not American *and* British *and* German, they were Chinese and Chinese only, just like they are.
t1_dt1lf6t	0	*	Imperialists don't build walls to keep others out. They take over. China was mostly on the receiving end of attacks because they occupy the most valuable land.
t1_dt1n05v	1	*	Uh, Trump literally uses his name as his brand for his businesses. A campaign to call him 'doodoo head' would be name calling. This is very simple rebranding.
t1_dt29ewj	0	*	Yeah it's copy pasta, you have to do some work like click the original link. Youtube cuts off part of the text in links and I'm on mobile. You'd also have to ignore the many other sources in my OP. 
t1_dt1ounu	0	*	Where did I ever say that? Quite the contrary: history does matter, and learning from it moreso. The US has in many respects. 
t1_dt1g893	1	*	Melania probably cheats on Trump. Hillary hooks up with Huma Abedin regularly. They just happen to be smarter than their husbands.

t1_dt1gjkj	0	*	Not really the point.
t1_dt1orjf	0	*	per capita US is twice that of China. that is DOUBLE and not look good for any American individual
t1_dt30h2t	0	*	That's a pain.  So they're taking advantage of newer employees?  It's goofy how the government can handle pay in ways that'd be completely illegal anywhere else.
t1_dt1m4yg	0	*	It's dramatically easier to sway the uneducated, because they have a harder time seeing through your bullshit.
t1_dt1aarj	1	*	And this led to why Taiwan is so hotly debated, why people on Reddit and the world over complain about Chinese tourists, etc... 
t1_dt2q1s1	0	*	Thats...thats not what populism is at all...

t1_dt1qbcy	1	*	That's what amendments are for. 
t1_dt1lz7a	0	*	The standard, which was set by someone else, was zero.   If I said you have zero comprehension skills I'd be wrong. You have very poor comprehension, but it still ain't zero.
t1_dt1aizb	1	*	That's an interesting point of view, and considering their long history it makes a lot of sense. 
t1_dt1edrw	1	*	Haha. I've been judged for less at work! No worries. Just tense around here.
t1_dt1h8om	1	*	Lol fuck New Jersey and its draconian gun laws
t1_dt1lacc	1	*	What downvotes? I down voted this time because you said that, though. And I'm not in a position of Democratic leadership, I have no reason to be nice to you. I don't give a shit how you vote.

t1_dt1h2mr	0	*	And? It still happened? How about a swat team in Kansas killing a man due to a fake phone call? That happened a month ago. 
t1_dt1f3pi	1	*	Well my inner punk still listens to The Prodigy and Iron Maiden... 
t1_dt1ite1	1	*	Do you really believe that? That tweeting is worse than quietly jailing whistleblowers and journalists?
t1_dt1jtb7	0	*	Hopefully we can get an audit of the intelligence agencies to root out that fascism. Trump isn't a great guy, but he's our best hope of shining light on the disgusting corruption in the system.
t1_dt1fr4p	0	*	I'm not saying we should adopt China's style of governance, I'm saying our nation spends a lot more time criticizing others than it does reflecting on our own behavior. 
t1_dtx47qw	0	*	No problem. Thank you for donating too. I know we don't agree on things but I don't have any problem with you. We just agree to disagree. 
t1_dv2edqn	0	*	Too vague? What are you even on about? It isn't a hard question, it's a simple matter of How are we supposed to determine what is fair?

t1_dsyfltk	0	*	Only to you it seems.  Maybe you should have joined the conversation earlier rather than later.
t1_dsz5cdk	1	*	Ah Jordan. And it doesnt matter. They lost the war and god punished muslims by taking their land for hubris and gluttony. 
t1_dsyhofg	1	*	It's a friendly nickname. People who run countries that are universally hated, like North Korea, get unfriendly nicknames. 
t1_ds7my5k	1	*	I'm calling bullshit on that

t1_dugynz6	1	*	I'll take a look. I'm reasonably versed already. Problem is that there's of a lot of 'almost' crimes, hence my call to be braced for disappointment.
t1_duh6iy1	0	*	The Fed and The State aren't the same thing.  Neither of them can charge you twice, but they can both do so individually.  
t1_duhyl2n	0	*	You people have been denying the legitimacy of this investigation from the beginning. Further than that I will not waste my time with you.
t1_duhalr6	0	*	What is a pixe8ce of shit?
t1_duhelvw	1	*	Our country seems to be going through a great depression in the emotional sense, not economical sense.
t1_duhaezu	1	*	They'd pay someone $50 to pay a prisoner $20 to shank him instead.
t1_duh7urf	1	*	no not every crime, but such high profile people should be. trump didnt pick random people out of no where, he picked people that have been in the public eye for 30-50 years. 
t1_dv3v594	1	*	Whew!  I was gonna say... the IoT is getting out of hand!
t1_dv46zk8	0	*	How can you 'responsibly' eat a McDonalds burger?
t1_dv45mi6	1	*	So right after Rule 34?  Contemplating now whether or not its a bad idea to google Hitler Rule 34.
t1_dv4ajge	1	*	I'll stick with heroin, thanks. 
t1_dv4cqiz	1	*	He said on that and ivory so I assume it covered both to begin with
t1_dv586ns	1	*	The difference is there's really someone actually named Mikhail Mikhailovich Mikhailov.
t1_dv44wv5	1	*	Well yea. Just because we are a much more complex predator does not mean we don't have an effect on evolution of other species. 
t1_dv450wt	1	*	Suck it Godwin 
t1_dv5gacu	0	*	After 15 years you would have a steady flow of horn.Banks chase loans the kickback 30,000 after 30 years, I see no difference with this.
t1_dtfaoud	1	*	thank you for the correction.  I've been reading enough to get confused. 
t1_dtfgwzg	1	*	Back in the late 2000s, you can mine crypto or run folding@home AND heat your room at the same time!
t1_dtdva84	0	*	Iraq war, supporting the Saudi's committing genocide in Yemen, using Agent Orange on vietnamese civillians, anything involving Israel. Thats just off the top of my head. 
t1_du7tslg	0	*	 Come on haha really? Where is Jerusalem? Is it in Iraq or Egypt? From the Nile to the Euphrates? Give me a break. 
t1_du8iex0	0	*	Or your premise is a fundamentally faulty one. 
t1_du8b00s	0	*	I made my point perfectly clear. If you try to read it instead of throwing out whataboutisms like a Russian it's plain as day what I'm saying. 
t1_dunozcw	0	*	>There's nothing morally wrong with enslaving your enemies  Uh, every single 1st world country is morally against slavery. You'd have to be pretty backwards to think slavery is OK in this day and age.
t1_dunjyfz	0	*	Neither Israel nor the Libyans are terrorists. Certainly not the best countries, but they aren't terrorists
t1_dtq43ck	0	*	It means somethingxa0implied or suggested as naturally to be inferred or understood
t1_dtrja43	0	*	xa0Dee, I swear you would be of more use to me if I skinned you and turned your skin into a lampshade or fashioned you into a piece of high-end luggage. Add you to my collection
t1_dtqgk54	1	*	Easily up there.
t1_dtr8bo0	1	*	Is that how you take that? It was a rebuttal to your racially motivated killing theory. Grow up.
t1_dtpz8kc	0	*	I love Breaking Bad but I'd argue The Wire is a better show. Although it may be an unfair comparison as they have different goals.  
t1_duhqt7w	0	*	He's a constipated dragon.  This is how he actually sounds
t1_duht21x	0	*	How many people have the cash to do it though?
t1_duhmhbz	1	*	If that ever got momentum the big sticks would convert just enough people too handicap the movement and place it next to the other parties that get no votes. 
t1_duhr9q8	1	*	It doesn't but it just becomes CO2 over time. So still bad over all.
t1_duhpgkd	0	*	Anyone else get the feeling the constitution is a little out of date? 
t1_dujr432	1	*	Preventing money in politics for one. Publicly funded political campaigns, and a more potent FEC with some enforcement capability. 
t1_duhph1u	0	*	Its almost like everything not built by europeans was built by aliens . Didn't you get the memo ?
t1_duhrcfo	0	*	I never subscribed to the notion that the troops would deploy on US soil against the populace in the event of a full on revolt. But I would definitely be concerned about drones. 
t1_duj09bd	1	*	We need our AR 15s to shoot whats left of the sea ice.
t1_duhy6wm	1	*	effect is quite small, that's correct
t1_duig17r	1	*	Totally. The day I don't wakeup is the day i'm truly peaceful. Not to say i'm suicidal, but i'm sure as hell not thrilled to be here.
t1_duhz70g	0	*	You are contributing nothing, just complaining. And people get insulty when others deny basic facts.
t1_duiwnp9	1	*	The civil war never ended, it just went cold.
t1_duhnyqm	0	*	He literally said drugs and cures. No one said scientific discoveries. 
t1_dukq3kv	1	*	60 years ago the wealthiest were taxed at 90%, let's just go back to that. 
t1_duhwjbx	1	*	I think it gets turned into CO2 though, so that's not great.
t1_dui79yl	0	*	You again danced away from my direct question.   Thanks, you are unwilling to engage so Ill leave you alone.
t1_duhpmvg	0	*	Difference being that the army would also be playing on home turf, while in Afghanistan they were an informationally handicapped away team.
t1_duhoyu6	0	*	> Who the fuck do they think they're going to use their guns on?  Non-white people.   At least, that's the impression us Europeans have of the whole 2nd amendment issue.
t1_dui1zdl	1	*	Well in reguards to poop cows to excrete quite a bit of methane.
t1_duho4rf	0	*	So removing the barrier/collusion is a solution. Difficult =/= not possible. But itll only work if the employment link is broke and everyone has to pay for their own insurance.
t1_duhnjpg	1	*	It's almost like Stargate never happened.
t1_duhwgls	0	*	The Republicans didn't repeal the ACA.
t1_duhx7ea	0	*	It's heavily regulated to be high
t1_duk0tih	1	*	the republican pundit want scientific based facts not peer reviewed papers that are based of best guesses of the best correlated trend.. shits funny how you cant understand
t1_duhwfk7	1	*	I support universal healthcare, though. Insurance is not something people inherently need. *Healthcare* is something people inherently need. There is a difference. 
t1_dujv8jt	0	*	Northern Europe is much dryer than Central America, and yet Mesoamerican pyramids survived thousands of years.
t1_duhv2js	0	*	This is all true but the heat increase won't be all that bad since it's so close to the equator, and warming increases the closer you get to the poles.
t1_duhi4cl	1	*	In offshore detention centres sure.
t1_duhrfg6	0	*	How can you be certain or even uncertain of the accuracy given that no one can check records from 1500 years ago?
t1_dui49m7	0	*	From your prospective from outside the country, do you really believe that some of the people in the US dont have access to healthcare? 
t1_duhqq2k	1	*	We could agree to disagree, if I had actually said anything about about what your saying I wrote.
t1_duhou4m	1	*	You should talk to some lawyers I know. They are convinced that Trump is leading us towards constitutional collapse within the year.
t1_duhwklk	1	*	Wasn't expecting a punch line actually.
t1_duhpabp	0	*	You think house prices are cheaper in America because standard of living is higher and not due to (largely) geography?
t1_duhss34	0	*	40% is not 100%... What the actual fuck?
t1_dui0208	1	*	Try and stop us, lol.
t1_duhkhql	0	*	Its one of the reasons why my wife and I have decided not to have a child of our own. We might adopt or foster in the future, but we won't be reproducing on our own. 
t1_duixxfl	1	*	This kind of thinking is what the Russians and Americans had in Afghanistan, and what the French and Americans thought in Vietnam. Greater military technology does not equal victory.
t1_duhn0w5	1	*	call it FREEDOMISM and you have a fighting chance.
t1_duhnxcj	0	*	I love how uneducated this is. Applied research (ie producing the drug/cure) is paid for by a corporate company, in order to profit.   So youre welcome.
t1_duhu2ns	0	*	Ofc blame americas problems on socialism... while not even europe is socialist. Also, you are wrong about taxing. i barely pay 10% in taxes, healthcare etc with a low income job. German.
t1_duhps9h	1	*	This already happened in 1865.  The rebellion against the government failed spectacularly. Pity the south can't remember anything but the Alamo. 
t1_duhn6s8	0	*	...American citizens who I've met **in person** are not media. Nor are academics.  >Its funny you say its the most nazi thing ever considering we saved you from them...  I'm sorry, are you Russian?
t1_duhmmjt	0	*	I think your idea of sea level rise might be a bit off. It's not like a one massive wall surrounding the country would need to be built to keep the ocean out. 
t1_duhh5c9	0	*	Yes, only 20 years instead of 400 or so.
t1_duhpdq2	1	*	Also: Why the fuck would they need guns in this scenario? If the military was on their side, there would be no goddamn need to have guns in the first place. It'd be a default win.
t1_duhskx3	1	*	Manhatten got tanks, tear gas, water cannon, rubber bullets, cavalry.  the 2A fan bois cheered.  
t1_duhxdpg	0	*	I believe the Nazis were pretty favorable to welfare though, so I don't think they'd be too keen towards my anti-welfare stances. 
t1_duhphok	0	*	Look at Australia. They did exactly that. Here's an [article](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/10/australia-gun-control/541710/) about it.
t1_duhiopd	1	*	Who do you thinks makes up the majority of our construction workforce?
t1_duhnh2m	1	*	If I recall correctly, even if every bit of land based ice were to melt, the total maximum sea level rise would only be like 215 feet, so Waterworld will have to remain an impossible fantasy. 
t1_duhwocz	0	*	> 1500 years for the climate is NOTHING.   This doesn't mean anything. What is your point?
t1_duhk3mw	0	*	Hah, as if any Australian drinks Foster's.
t1_duhs886	1	*	He is taking up all the server space!   /s
t1_duhnox1	0	*	This is one of those situations where I agree with your point but you made it so obnoxiously that I dont care what you have to say anymore. 
t1_duhn127	1	*	Yes but when it breaks down it mostly turns into CO2 IIRC
t1_duhpizm	0	*	We have an entire holiday dedicated to patriotism. Most other countries think that is just bizzare and overly patriotic. 
t1_duhwdbg	0	*	Like the Fourth Amendment?
t1_duhxg2n	0	*	A lot less than sea water. In the freezing process, much of the salt in ocean water is squeezed out of the frozen crystal formations, though some remains frozen in the ice.
t1_dui20d1	1	*	> One of the reasons is nicer than the rest of china.  Nicer in what way? IMO Shenzhen >>>> HK.
t1_duhzrfp	0	*	Whoa whoa whoa, don't get upset there buddy!
t1_dui2p6c	0	*	AFAIK it's not illegal to own a fighter jet, as long as the attached machinegun (if it still has one) is pre-1986.
t1_dsmt7v4	0	*	Well that will screw both of us over.
t1_dt4j7qx	1	*	Then just put the blocks out for competitive bids.
t1_dsnnf0u	1	*	Right, thanks! Will edit my comment.
t1_dtc128c	0	*	>Your entire point was that HK protesters were in danger of being gunned dow  No where i said that. 
t1_dtc6ivf	1	*	It is  S.O.P of every china thread. For everything china is bad,   bring up what about the US and US alone?   Typical communist propaganda. 
t1_dtc5m4s	0	*	Taiwan is not recognized by a single country as an independent country. Not even the US recognizes it. Taiwan still considers mainland China and Mongolia theirs. 
t1_dtqb30x	1	*	So we are at the no true Scottsman: the Jews of Israel cannot be counted as Jewish for the study. I can live with that.
t1_dtqjuh5	1	*	Retarted lol
t1_dtxnu3c	0	*	Could the camps have run without Polish and Ukrainian collaborators ? In Shoa they talk with one (or the) Polish train driver delivering the Jews to Treblinka. 
t1_dtqevb3	0	*	No explain me.
t1_dtxnvh6	1	*	I'm not super familiar with Poland, but in most places the mayor is part of the local government
t1_dscb9d8	1	*	Amen! That and a Steam Library full of games will keep you set 
t1_duclruz	1	*	Yeah looks like it was that.  I still remember something about token being sent to Google whenever you enter private mode.
t1_dsn2vob	0	*	They charge the restaurants a percentage fee on the sales. 
t1_dsn93ke	0	*	That does not make any sense, since I'm sure just eat charges a percent of every order (usually 15%) or a monthly fee, which is probably much higher than just a credit card processing fee (~3%).
t1_dsmt7xa	0	*	As long as it says it's left my account, and says it's in theirs, then that's good enough for me.
t1_dsn7pa6	1	*	That would be my guess too.  At least here in Australia, a lot of merchant agreements prohibit taking card payments over the phone. 
t1_dsmjypt	0	*	that makes sense, as it is probably cheaper than investing in the machine (no idea how much it costs, just guessing).
t1_dtsk5j6	1	*	Naturally. :)
t1_dtsaaym	1	*	>. Like how aspartame  meant to imitate sugar  That seems like a stretch. What do you mean?   Aspartame is meant to be sweet -not taste like _______ (sugar, etc)
t1_duez8xp	1	*	They make sure it's sexually incriminating obviously. If I guy is asking if he can take her virginity and sending dick pics.. 
t1_duer916	1	*	Lmfao you are terrible at discussions, you assert a claim but refuse to back it up, just more commenting with no validation. 
t1_duery6d	1	*	that's a bit of a low blow, isn't it?
t1_dsjqzlq	1	*	Im not disputing your claims.   Only saying that advertising isnt always entirely truthful, at least in America. The FCC is clearly compromised to some extent. 
t1_dsiakeo	1	*	Initial capital is easy to acquire if there is a profit motive. Besides, the initial capital to form an ISP isn't that high. Municiplities are doing it all over the country.
t1_dsjmqpe	0	*	Yeah.. pension funds don't buy ETFs or mutual funds. That's why the pension fund exists. They buy the securities themselves.
t1_dsiluou	0	*	It's a subsidy... for consumers. Not for manufacturers. The manufacturers don't get subsidies.
t1_dsjqzgb	1	*	Im not disputing your claims.   Only saying that advertising isnt always entirely truthful, at least in America. The FCC is clearly compromised to some extent. 
t1_dsis6c6	0	*	Yeah, I get that most of what I pay for petrol is actually tax (UK). It's scary how cheap it is all things considered.
t1_dshubdy	0	*	you questions remind me what brand of tripod did you use for your photos?...  sorry, you don't pass the turing test, there is no point to continue.  
t1_dsibm7d	0	*	Twitters soul purpose of existence is to make their shareholders money. 
t1_dsho0sl	1	*	Agreed. Another Lefty who understands that here.
t1_dsj0jkr	1	*	Those shady undercover apple salesmen... *shakes fist*  But yes, that is a great point!
t1_dsi3kzp	1	*	Yeah, that's it for sure.
t1_du1lgag	0	*	> The claim wasn't that Russia has influenced our elections.  How do you think they influenced the elections?  You're either very naive or just willfully ignorant. 
t1_du1yjo9	0	*	Are we taking about problems within the US or the humanitarian crisis facing the people of North Korea?
t1_du2ji9x	0	*	I don't think you understand. Obama is bad mm'kay?
t1_du1iued	0	*	Been real nice talking to you!
t1_du1cdke	0	*	Ive been able to spoof my location as being in Pyongyang using a VPN before. They have snapchat filters and everything.
t1_du1h5ep	1	*	Well, I take pride in admitting I'm wrong.  I'd appreciate your insight into the flaws of my assumptions.
t1_du1nygj	0	*	It's literally screenshots of headlines for the most part.  Way to avoid the cognitive dissonance though. Never question the press. The Ministry of Truth would never deceive the citizenry.
t1_du1byp1	1	*	Yep, 365 is great.  
t1_du1gzem	1	*	Eh, Id say the British government was formed by the acts of Union, in 1707
t1_dv3bcs8	0	*	So Americans not loaning them money is the problem with their economy?
t1_dtj079m	0	*	it wouldnt go up, you just said there would be inflation and you would get same amount of stuff
t1_dssfbhi	0	*	Met a Brazilian traveling in Thailand. His Samsung galaxy was pick pocketed and he bought a new one the next day. He said it was like half the price he paid for his.
t1_dsd7dsj	0	*	You don't know what you are talking about, how the id system work. It is not worth talking with you. Not okay, good riddance.
t1_dty3k6r	0	*	Trump obviously lives in the front of your mind. He is all you can think about even though the content of this article has nothing to do with the Federal government nor your president. 
t1_dtvsx4q	0	*	In time. In time.
t1_duui91d	0	*	I'm also in support of LKY's Singapore. Authoritarianism isn't a synonym for Hitler and Stalin, the same way democracy isn't necessary a synonym for less chaotic country.
t1_duq40e1	1	*	I will be much better adjusted when our gun violence problem goes down. Until then stay out of my way if you don't like my emotional reaction to seeing MY countrymen get slaughtered like animals. 
t1_duqbw2e	0	*	Glad to see you admit you weren't clear in your original statement.
t1_dv0k7g6	1	*	Wow if you just bolded one or two more words you would have cowed me
t1_dv0lhyn	1	*	I hate tipping as much as my friends across the puddle
t1_dv0he3k	0	*	Huh, guess living here makes it seem standard. Military service is seen as honorable due to you basically devoting a portion of your life and rights.
t1_dtr98vw	1	*	My mistake. By using the phrase: a tight grip on information, I thought you were implying that the Egyptians know something that they aren't telling us.
t1_dtdqp0r	0	*	How is any of that in any way relevant to the discussion at hand? None of that has anything to do with libel at all...
t1_dt3bbbm	0	*	That speaks more to the charecter of Israeli PM's than anything else, is it too hard to resist corruption for them for some reason? Or are the laws just extra silly?
t1_dt2xwnu	0	*	Quite literal use of the holocaust card. Great job.
t1_dsfreml	1	*	Don't take every single word you read so serious. My comment wasn't a professional essay posted on a debate forum curated by PhD's. 
t1_dsger4f	1	*	That's insane, it happens all the time and nobody cares.   Russia is not launching some surprise naval invasion of Florida, this isn't the sixties.
t1_dt7ox24	0	*	I guess reality is just ignorant about your true culture then.
t1_dszxcp2	0	*	No one who needed medicine wasn't able to receive it as a result of Shkreli but okay keep saying whatever feels like the truth, it's the internet.
t1_dszu2z1	0	*	On drugs that were going to go out of production.....  Which means they wouldn't have existed AT ALL without him producing them....
t1_dt0zdnf	1	*	Yes! I always say this. Isn't capitalism's end game the same as Monopoly's? Someone wins. We're getting there now. Or we already are. 
t1_dt0ir44	1	*	Well this settles it folks, the murderers cannot be Canadian or else they would have left a nice gilded coffin.
t1_dt04bo5	0	*	unlike you I have judgment. you meanwhile are waiting for your masters to tell you what to believe. 
t1_dt04ei4	1	*	Shit! Im a billionaire!?!? Where do I get my check?
t1_dt04oqw	0	*	Unregulated capitalism certainly favors those kind of people, that's for sure.
t1_dszvowl	0	*	Money = fucking target on your head.   Sorry but thats how the world has worked since the concept of money has existed 
t1_dt08jeh	1	*	It's a fucked up mentality that people making millions off an immoral system  feel they are getting 'fucked' when they have to start doing it fairly. It just shows how detached from society they are. 
t1_dt07pgp	1	*	Had you taken your shoes off? 
t1_dt00ypf	0	*	Sherman himself once said he was surprised that none of the guys he fucked over ever tried to bump him off. (reported in some news article)
t1_dszwsmj	0	*	You watch too much TV, mate.
t1_dszvxuy	0	*	For sure, but we'd know who did it. 
t1_dt1rz9r	0	*	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Hastings_(journalist) 
t1_dszu0u9	0	*	Check this posters other comments. They claim to work in the pharmaceutical industry but continually post incorrect things.
t1_dszz7cr	0	*	Sounds interesting. Do you have examples of times this has happened in the past? 
t1_dszwty4	0	*	People dont keep their money under their mattress anymore. Which family member  financially benefits from these people being dead. That was my point. 
t1_dt07zfc	1	*	Fair point. I'm 30 and still refer to myself as a kid but I meant our generation (but also probably assumed it extended to younger generations when perhaps it doesn't)
t1_dt01mls	1	*	Agreed. 
t1_dt0dt6y	1	*	I'm Canadian.  I'm more liberal than conservative.   And yes my parents are proud of me.
t1_dsztyf7	0	*	You act like they did it themselves, throwing 50k at someone to make your problems go away isnt unheard of 
t1_dt0217t	1	*	O shit You can take my turn too then you kinky fucker
t1_dszuuvp	0	*	He's in jail for putting a bounty on Hillary's hair.
t1_dt036c9	1	*	Dude waffles aren't forever if they're in my vicinity.
t1_dt0dl16	0	*	Well relative to Canada it sure is. Our murder rate is terrible, and while it is concentrated in some areas its still not great. 
t1_dszwwuy	1	*	Almost no one does?  Completely untrue.  Plenty of regular folks donate enough time and money that it hurts.    I think you meant almost no billionaire does. 
t1_dt015jr	1	*	https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/7rkoex/british_15yearold_gained_access_to_intelligence/ this was it lets gather now.
t1_dt04fiw	1	*	like most human traits, its a normal distribution. So, half are below average.
t1_dt081o1	1	*	Over a large sample size (i.e. 7 billion humans) every distribution can be estimated by a normal so the mean will be equal to the median, your example only holds for a few people
t1_dt0vf60	0	*	Yeah, those morons are harming others. Thats the problem. You seem very stupid. That's sad.
t1_dt0ilkv	1	*	I mean...you can't prove she didn't do all that.   Checkmate, liberals. ^^^^^^/s
t1_dszwqwz	0	*	You probably could simply look up his address. Wouldnt be hard to do. Warren Buffet lives humbly too, but I imagine he still has security up the ass.
t1_dt08tv2	1	*	car > no car
t1_dszzhw6	0	*	And you are saying he owes the world all of his wealth when he was based in Canada? Canada is not the entire world society. You first world anarchist are absolute shite
t1_dt02q33	1	*	I think we found a very touchy Russian. Or a trump supporter.
t1_dszy04c	1	*	If that were the case billionaires would be falling over dead all the time.
t1_dt06ruk	0	*	But that's biting the hand that feeds. We need to look at ourselves first and figure out why this mentality is so prevalent in society.
t1_dt04g79	0	*	I think people are down voting you because you're English is really bad, like to the point people can't understand you.  Try writing with a little grammar and I feel people wouldn't down vote you
t1_dt04a8c	1	*	All your points would likely galen regardless of how relationship with the Sherman family. Any billionaire or powerful family astride would impact Trudeau and others.
t1_dt009gu	0	*	It seems like u/Elite_Four_Phoebe has been suicid
t1_dt03f9g	0	*	If I complain enough and tell everyone how unfair things are, while simultaneously sabotaging myself to be a perpetual failure, I too can become a statistic that proves how awful Amerikkka is! -LSC
t1_dszwr9z	1	*	He gave the drugs to patients for free. The only people getting fucked were the insurance companies. You have no idea what you're talking about.
t1_dszyfvg	0	*	I live in canada bro, you're the one with the 75 year old incestual speed freak for a president.
t1_dszv1fe	1	*	For the insurance companies IIRC. The patients themselves would still get it for free or cheap.
t1_dt08adq	1	*	You are underestimating the nuclear arsenal existing. Depending of how widespread such war would be it can shut down agriculture. It would a geological event.
t1_dt04mrb	0	*	Hate to burst your bubble but IQ is normalized to be a normal distribution with 100 as the average. The tests are retooled every 10 years or so to ensure this.
t1_dszxgr2	1	*	Two that I can think of off the top of my head that are privately owned:  Sacklers - Perdue pharma Boehringers - Boehringer Ingleheim  I'm sure there are others that can be added.   
t1_dszx5fm	0	*	PM cannot be involved in police work, such as telling the RCMP what to do.
t1_dszzill	0	*	I guess I don't even have to cite that quote since you provided it lmao 
t1_dszxa2m	0	*	Been listening since spring of 2016. It's been fun to watch this fun idea between friends become this thing. I'm personally invested at this point. One of my highlights of 2017 was making a minisode.
t1_dt04ox7	1	*	It's a normal distribution. Furthermore, IQ rating is literally made so that 100 = average.
t1_dsztnsi	1	*	Kist curious, On what level did you work there?
t1_dszzr8t	1	*	I guess but usually if there is high rates of murder then the chance of less lethal crimes is always higher unless its a serial killer. Paranoia sells though.Well not to this billionaire.
t1_dszydrw	1	*	Oh, that was a good one.
t1_dt01ctf	1	*	I imagine asphyxiation. Some real fluffy bread and no water to quench the thirst?
t1_dt0eezq	1	*	Congratulations: you're ignorant.
t1_dt00d47	0	*	I'd be interested, too. Don't see anything.

t1_dszthmh	1	*	Typical American amirite?
t1_dt0h253	1	*	Thanks! Wow... What a turd.
t1_dsztubi	0	*	No, perception means you find random dude on the phone book and ask if they **think** there's corruption.  Not if there's actual corruption.
t1_dt0ebym	0	*	lol, this never happened, so your friend doesn't exist.
t1_dt0a95m	1	*	yes
t1_dt03jj8	0	*	While hypothetically possible, there are no known cases of it happening.
t1_dszxhab	1	*	I live in South Africa. For the record it's not at all a shithole country. I have yet to be robbed in South Africa (knock on wood) something I can't say when I lived in the US.

t1_dszwbh9	1	*	Shithole you say? 
t1_dszwe4t	0	*	No this isn't baseless speculation. Read my last post. 
t1_dt0kn6f	1	*	Yeah, I probably overreacted, it's my bad.
t1_dt0923n	1	*	Thanks haha nice to get the feedback.
t1_dt72oxh	1	*	What? I didnt say Syria.
t1_dt00p4m	1	*	I am not sure stating it wasnt a murder-suicide is the same as private investigators indicating it looked like a murder for hire.
t1_dt0mcwf	1	*	Well, these are the suckers we can take advantage of. 
t1_dszw5y7	0	*	Sure. It only takes one board member acting in secret to protect their company and having the right connections to make this sort of thing plausible. 
t1_dszxx8u	0	*	Yeah last one I listened to was 100. It got really old just having them talk over each other the whole time and wasn't a very cohesive episode. Thanks though, I'll check that one out! 
t1_dt00jt8	0	*	Maybe the hit was in fact coming from people who would benefit from the downfall of those enemies... Maybe people shorted those stocks?  This is going to be a movie isn't it...?
t1_dt07zeb	1	*	*eyetwitch*
t1_dszw71w	0	*	So you should invest in no security because potentially somebody could hire *fucking commandos?*
t1_dt21344	1	*	IIRC the movie covers the first two out of a total of seven books, I'm excited for you!
t1_dtnrh5c	1	*	Kiss me
t1_dtnm95d	0	*	Mechanical engineer working in aerospace here. You're ridiculously misinformed about how planes, buildings, and materials work. This is exactly why 9-11 conspiracy theories are still alive.
t1_dtmuevt	0	*	So nothing then?    Why am I not surprised?
t1_dtny67d	1	*	The people doing these experiments were the generation that raised the boomers.  No wonder most of them are socially apathetic, self-indulgent, entitled, and standoffish.
t1_dxhvtx9	1	*	Unlike you, I have a job and a life.
t1_dtnhls7	0	*	Did you watch WT 7 fall, again?   Have you started on the path of believing your own eyes?  Even dodge ram drivers can... Do it, my friend... come to the truther side.
t1_dtmt8p3	1	*	Was mentioning the shot even relevant?
t1_dtoi053	1	*	Okay. I knew there was a ton of chemistry but I dont know how far it went. Ive always heard nursing was an incredible rigorous program. 
t1_dtnptfx	0	*	Yeah, everyone is a shill for big flu shot, which barely makes a profit in any given year due to the amount of research and development required. Especially anyone telling you to relax
t1_dtnlgot	0	*	So I thought of an insult related to that, and it's not targeted at you because I have no reason to be mean but I want to say it because I like it.  In this life, you're only up your own arse
t1_dtn5fu9	0	*	if people know, then its not a conspiracy
t1_dtn7cc1	0	*	question remains, if the list of withdrawn drugs is so long, shouldn't you avoid ALL medicine forever? you never know what might be withdrawn in the future.
t1_dto6wdx	1	*	I never thought about it like that, maybe you're one to something! 
t1_dtnyd2s	0	*	The critic doesn't need to be an artist as well.  Anybody can call bullshit on anybody.
t1_dtmxe8i	0	*	dude, you just told me that youre autistic. you do know what autism means in regards to the judgment you just made, right?
t1_dtny8ih	1	*	We should bring back CFCs. I'm pretty sure they dispersed chemtrails which is why the guvment made us stop using them.
t1_dtn08k9	0	*	Sorry your point is private health care isn't paying for it? I'd accept maybe if it was part of your taxes, but your point makes no sense.
t1_dtn0x9z	0	*	Calling someone ignorant isn't an insult. You have no knowledge on the matter so you keep trolling. 
t1_dtn0kqf	1	*	insufficient money, family connections and qualifications needed to get into a medical school. She would have been an amazing doctor.
t1_dtp5eyg	1	*	Hope you also don't eat whole grains, beans, nuts, or green leafy vegetables, those all contain magnesium, another poisonous metal!  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermagnesemia
t1_dtnc7so	1	*	Right? I took psychology 101 and literally know everything about how everything works.  Plus, argued Wikipedia should be a primary source during my English lit finals! 
t1_dto0hwx	1	*	But now its the spittin image of the Virgin Mary. 
t1_dtnnys9	1	*	Call him Joe Budden
t1_dtn0wji	0	*	Do you have ANY clue how combination vaccines work or how these effectiveness estimates are derived and utilized?  
t1_dupymie	1	*	Well, in that case, I'll be happy to pick up the ball and say exactly that!
t1_dupp43q	0	*	Thanks. I am in many ways. Screwed up forever in others.  A long time, but I found peace.
t1_dur6cn6	0	*	How is it barbaric? It removes their sex-drive with medication. They're not getting their junk destroyed by acid, if that's what you're thinking.
t1_duq68s2	1	*	Now there's a funny angle I'd never thought of, lol.
t1_dupyzk2	1	*	Is that German for Maaah, seeeee?????
t1_dupu5y8	1	*	No, you said God doesn't conform to the normal laws of logic. Totally different. 
t1_dusww4y	1	*	I don't remember the exact phrasing, but that's probably it.
t1_dupm8v3	0	*	straightened me right out with the CUNT word lol
t1_dt1gbpx	1	*	U0001f44dU0001f44d
t1_dt1xddz	1	*	I'm not making any excuses for anyone. I'm pointing out that you are making delusional claims.
t1_dt3dafn	0	*	OK, and he says yeah somebody told me this.  So what?
t1_dt11dch	0	*	Thank you for proving that you are completely unable to respond. Wikileaks still has a 10+ year record of telling the truth.
t1_dt4ytxv	0	*	I was talking about that specific strain. But still it has to do with the fact that weed smells much more potent than a cigg amells.
t1_dt46tas	0	*	No, they cant evict anyone for taking medicine. Thus the article.
t1_dt4yjb2	0	*	If you couldnt smoke it conveniently, would you buy it as often?
t1_dt4uwzn	0	*	Oh thanks for the explanation
t1_dt46z1f	1	*	I live in London, sidewalk smoking is everywhere.  Maybe you guys have your own bylaws on top of provincial ones? 
t1_dt4mpr1	0	*	Dont even get them started on fish in the office microwave.  Its assault!
t1_dt48jjd	1	*	I guess you're right, I just don't see a real need.   Eh, I suppose you could be coincidentally introducing a patient to weed by letting then use a vaporizer and then accidentally get then ripped lol
t1_dt4u704	1	*	Lol really dude? What kind of weed is that?
t1_dt50oy3	0	*	Then do something about the cause you believe in. Discussing it online with people who disagree with you will only make you angry that the discussion still exists.
t1_dt6d287	0	*	Why? What does it have to do with what we're talking about? The topic is marijuana and you mentioned tobacco exactly zero times - how would anyone know what you're talking about? 
t1_dupe83s	0	*	Then whats stopping the US from doing it, surely there are cases where land should have been given back to the native americans? Is this not what reservations are?
t1_dtclmdd	1	*	I don't know - like I said, it's baffling to me.
t1_dtcqau4	1	*	Looks like there are more Nazis than you realized. 
t1_dtfzl0f	1	*	> and now you're suddenly a socialist  Are you illiterate?
t1_dthygbn	0	*	did you read the comments on that post?
t1_dsjvf3k	0	*	Notice he said *after* WW2. The bombs were dropped a month before the end of WW2, so he's likely just being pedantic or just trying to troll. 
t1_dskfi9n	1	*	I don't doubt it, though the people of Taiwan certainly don't share the views of the CCP from my experience.
t1_dsjvshf	1	*	He was being pedantic because the original comment said AFTER ww2. 
t1_dsjw6z9	1	*	There was a coup attempt made by members of the military after Hirohito announced he would surrender.
t1_dsk6xx6	1	*	They did.  I'd say some of that lives on in their horror games. Looking at Silent hill and such
t1_dsk5nyt	0	*	Lmao you're the one making baseless accusations you colossal fuck, either provide some proof or stop saying stupid shit. 
t1_dsjua54	0	*	Uh oh. We got one of those... 
t1_dslb1wv	1	*	Yeah, and we own our mistakes as a country. The bad and good are both part of our history.
t1_dsjz03p	0	*	A blockade would have been the most cruel and inhumane option.
t1_dslg0t6	0	*	Leadership, government officials.  My point still stands.  
t1_dsjruin	0	*	lol, thats the spirit, double down on stupidity....did you attend trump university?
t1_dsk62s6	0	*	Graduated HS in 2016. A lot of it wildly depends on the school district as well.
t1_dsjb18s	1	*	I would suggest a more appropriately targeted reply then so your message is clear. Looks like you're being cranky at a rando
t1_dsk98uf	0	*	No one denies what happened to the Indians in America. We literally memorialize things like the trail of tears. We don't go after first nation people in Mexico or Canada for remembering either. 
t1_dskfdp1	0	*	No, I mean I was actually living in China and my Chinese friends had very nationalistic views. I didn't believe these views were wrong or right, they were just their views.
t1_dskg96f	0	*	Cats do what?
t1_dsjgb1o	1	*	These were dark times indeed.
t1_dsk5xja	0	*	You realize that 'banzai' or the 'banzai salute' as you call it, is used as a celebratory chant/shout? Not just as a war cry or as some kind of Japanese supremacist symbol.
t1_dsjvk0k	0	*	Couldn't they demonstrate this hability somewere else?  Also, one worse war crime don't justify other war crimes
t1_dsa4gy2	0	*	I was talking about Belarus not Ukraine.
t1_dsa3o15	1	*	Well they guy's username is u/SwampKingTrump, so I guess that makes it excusable then.
t1_dttlo6g	0	*	> but 6 or 7 grand (total) is more than what the average UK person contributes to the NHS each year.  and now you know why its broke and failing 
t1_ds8s5ih	0	*	Walmart? They are the worst offender.   They are practically the reason for a minimum wage and the employment standards act.  
t1_ds8auxm	0	*	>Boo hoo poor business owners are going to go bankrupt over a %5 increase? Bullshit..  For a business with profit margin of less than 5%, yes
t1_dsacsaq	1	*	Company I work for managed to adapt... you've had months what were you waiting for? The government to say jk lol?
t1_ds89e1f	1	*	I never asked a person if their brain is working... 
t1_ds9ic8t	0	*	Nice strawman. But yes hampering business efficiency has never helped anyone. In fact there are countries with no or low minimum wage far more successful than Canada.
t1_ds8dg7a	1	*	They're also not US anymore.  They became Canadian for tax purposes when they bought Tim Hortons.
t1_ds90s6c	0	*	> Thinking of other people is selfish, instead of wanting to save my self 10 cents on a burger.  Thats some nice mental gymnastics.
t1_ds8bix0	0	*	because it disincentives workers to improve skills.   Also, increasing it to that level has a negative effect on jobs and income levels. Seattle is a prime example of what happened. 
t1_ds89gbu	0	*	and asking a question about motivation is attacking a persons character and intelligence?  Interesting connection. But if so, it was not meant as an insult. 
t1_dsb3nrh	0	*	how about you create a few jobs for 31 years before acting like a childish dick.
t1_dsalp3v	1	*	I know what the legislated minimum wages have been. This is the discussion.
t1_ds8xr2j	1	*	It also doesn't say if it's a net loss of jobs.
t1_ds8oa2g	0	*	Then those people are idiots. I understand just fine, but have my opinion.
t1_ds8mqup	0	*	Clearly these are the only possible outcomes. Workers get underpaid, or the collapse of small businesses. 
t1_ds8reut	1	*	I do not have any experience with your industry, however my opinion is that you should probably make higher.  When I graduated with a BSc, I was making 33k per year.  So not much more than you.
t1_dsajsub	1	*	Thats what I was trying to get at, but I was attempting to give the dude a best case scenario here. The main takeaway is that they wont go down lol.
t1_ds8ahtl	0	*	In 20 years yes.  
t1_ds8u025	0	*	>They sound like something out of a dystopian cyber-punk novel.  Why would you say that?
t1_ds8bsta	1	*	Well these struggling small business owners have to worry about their winter home in Florida after all. 
t1_ds8gyif	1	*	Ah yes, the old welfare queen canard.  Nice to see that making a comeback.  It's about as true now as it was in the '80s, not at all.
t1_ds9v9yp	1	*	It may have been meant as, but it never really was for a family anyway.  In Apartheid South Africa, they were supported by the trade unions as a way to keep blacks out of the labour force.
t1_dthp2wy	0	*	Better than those pathetic parents who take their shithead kids out to dinner and watch their kids spend more time with a rectangle then their mother and father
t1_dtise4x	0	*	They must have really rotted your brain if you think I don't own one (I'm just not 12) but unlike you I read a lot, exercise, play sports, go hiking, work etc
t1_dtd0nl6	0	*	They're too oily for one thing.
t1_dtd5g1x	0	*	He represents the country in political matters. That's about it. So... What exactly are you looking for here? 
t1_dtd0zt8	0	*	Shurikenautisticweeboo is just being a generalizing asshole trying to find reasons to talk shit about our country. Reminds me of Trump actually 
t1_dtgm0x3	0	*	Money does talk, which is why natural gas production is booming in the US, and coal production isn't. Regulation, though, is the only sure way to make fossil fuel production uneconmical. 
t1_dtd0ljw	0	*	I like his style.   We should impeach Trump, then have an elephant ass rape him.
t1_dtd4h6f	1	*	Important distinction.
t1_dtd4kfv	1	*	But it doesn't affect THIS QUARTER. That's about all the future that matters to them.
t1_dtd4qfh	1	*	East the rich. There's only one thing that they're good for.
t1_dtd2cgz	1	*	They dont care as long as they can maintain power. 
t1_dtd0rry	0	*	It was a joke. I was being silly, since northern ice caps shrink in the spring and return in the winter.
t1_dtdhz2y	0	*	From 25 years ago.

t1_dtd4bw0	1	*	I tried but that site blows

t1_dtd89zd	1	*	No that escalated very reasonably I think.
t1_dtd12ju	0	*	slightly better than the only other option will be the bar for any two-party system.
t1_dtdfez1	1	*	You're expecting a broken government to fix a broken system.
t1_dtd3zcj	1	*	Endorsing nazis is racist but walls aren't racist.  The rhetoric pushing for the wall, on the other hand...
t1_dtd15w0	0	*	No no, they'll hire more employees and give everyone raises and it will trickle down and make america great again!  You know, just like it did the last few times we tried that...
t1_dtd1xy1	1	*	You're so eloquent. Almost convinced me. A bit more and maybe you will.
t1_dtd2xln	1	*	When was this true?  The highest bidders were the ones pushing christen morals because emotion is a better way to control people.  
t1_dtd9w1y	0	*	I'm not going to do your research for you. Believe what you want. I truly don't care. 
t1_dtd2r9n	0	*	And those aren't trolls or bots. I see the same shit from old people from my hometown that jumped on Facebook.  The absolute stupidest shit comes out.  Maybe we're not meant to be a connected world...
t1_dtd76dl	0	*	What has Obama done that would make you think that about him? Other than give flowery feel-good speeches I mean?
t1_dtd2scx	0	*	Invest in garlicoin
t1_dtd98v9	0	*	She hurt all of Haiti. 
t1_dtdgj44	1	*	And it is very much not getting your money because it is not a *developing* country (like the four i mentioned)!
t1_dtd2wgs	0	*	White nationalist news website that until recently was run by former WH senior advisor Steve Bannon. Comment section is usually filled with racism, anti semitism, and stupidity.
t1_dtd4nhe	0	*	Why do you think Im talking to you? Its fun to see the failures of your thought process in action. Only in your addled partisan mind did I make the argument you claim I did. 
t1_dtddlt4	0	*	> global warming is alarmist bullshit in the first place.  Oh I see. We're at an impasse then. 
t1_dteixuf	1	*	Just a wild guess
t1_dtd5b5p	1	*	I never said it was all good. I said it was a possible silver lining. I don't personally know Obama; he might completely hate the situation.  
t1_dtcztuh	0	*	4 year old reddit account and he posts about Trump a lot.  I don't think he is a troll...
t1_dtd2pxz	0	*	They're predicting wrong lol. The idea that China is anywhere near as powerful as they claim is laughable. They just lie about all of their data.
t1_dtd1q8o	0	*	They only care about their own businesses. Society pays the debs, big business gets the rewards.
t1_dtd3n41	1	*	I mean, I dont think any of them were really paying their taxes anyway. Not in the US, at least.
t1_dtd2xp9	0	*	Appearing legitimate but actually being spurious  Also calm down dude
t1_dteg265	1	*	SHARRRRRY's BARRRRYS
t1_dtd1tza	0	*	Didn't say mate or cunt so you're obviously not Australian. 
t1_dtd9npm	1	*	Lol, auto correct fail. Comment invalid. 
t1_dtd0qmr	0	*	Read the post again. It's quite subtle.
t1_dtd1yox	0	*	It's semantics. It was oddly expressed but wasn't incorrect.
t1_dtd6qe2	1	*	Yeah. Who's talking about absolute numbers here? I understand that it is diverse but that still doesn't justify 37% of that diverse large pool of people to support this guy. 
t1_dtd4hpq	1	*	Yeah mate we're not too proud of that.
t1_dtfz3zn	0	*	Lmao you troll pretty good! 
t1_dtd3oph	0	*	Trump definitely saw his presidency going better than it is. He still thinks shit is going a lot better than it truly is.
t1_dtd114z	0	*	You missed the joke. 
t1_dtd623s	0	*	Rofl. 
t1_dtd906w	1	*	That's my point. 
t1_dtd2lbz	1	*	What a time to be alive...
t1_dtd61ba	1	*	That was the Paris Accord.   Take this stuff I'm buying for you and install it along with the dirty stuff.   That way you don't have to spend as much as I am switching over. 
t1_dtdmqce	1	*	Global cooling was a fringe theory, it didn't have widespread scientific support. Now we know that theory was wrong. It happens in science to correct past thinking.
t1_dte2s1v	1	*	that would make a good movie
t1_dtee83w	0	*	A higher percentage of Americans live below the poverty line than Chinese, just saying
t1_dtd0qud	0	*	I... think you missed the joke.

t1_dtd0ykf	1	*	Ok?
t1_dtd4oaq	0	*	I'm pretty sure he doesn't know a lot about golf. 
t1_dtd90yf	1	*	Completely dodged the question. 
t1_dtd90ds	1	*	Thanks for your service and you as well. Also, thanks for not frothing at the mouth and actually having a conversation.

t1_dtd7nsa	1	*	Oh boy. 
t1_dtd0xap	1	*	Yeah, most ice ever in the entire history of 2018.
t1_dteixi2	1	*	They're everywhere!
t1_dtd0bti	0	*	I'm ok with that. 
t1_dtda9lw	1	*	you haven't said what your school districts problems are.
t1_dshvg6f	1	*	That's kinda the point.
t1_dsiatqj	0	*	and yet..the President gets to appoint the judge...
t1_dsjxszh	1	*	You can't prefer neither when one or the other will run the country. Congrats, you got Trump.
t1_dsso1v1	0	*	Lol why would they be afraid?  Also if your dong is 'clean' and doesn't have cheesiness just because of the circumsicion then girls will probably stay away from you because of your bad hygiene.
t1_dsqvoyu	0	*	I dont blame you. You have no real choice.
t1_dsqyckc	1	*	Needed for natural lubricant too. Id be pissed off and bitchy too if i needed lube to wank
t1_dstoxf8	1	*	So, in short, you're an American missing part of your penis and you're trying to justify it?
t1_dsr7ykg	1	*	Taken care of. What fuck are you on about. It not like it was a cleft lip or something 
t1_dupmtok	0	*	Which makes the mistake even worse
t1_duq0wxf	0	*	I did read the wikipedia page. I just don't think that reading one wiki makes you an authority on the subject.  I find it hilarious that you do though. 
t1_duq14e7	1	*	They did use it. To shoot on defensive positions. And got blown up promptly during the first two minutes.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gohzw8MPC4  They had towed artillery...
t1_dt9m4jg	0	*	> less willing to ask questions and risk looking foolish while there were girls around.  Hate to sound like a dad, but they should man up and ask.

t1_dt8kxsg	1	*	Exactly
t1_dt9umcd	0	*	Oh. Then... I think we agree. Sorry.
t1_dt91ca0	0	*	If you can, please refrain from non-sequitur arguments. Like this one.
t1_dt9srub	0	*	Males tend to be expendable, cannon fodder whether human, or otherwise.  Sperm is cheaper than eggs.  I bet you find similar dynamics in ant colonies.
t1_dt8rgns	0	*	You implied that the historic injustices would justify future injustices in the opposite direction, which is something else entirely. 
t1_dt8rf1m	0	*	Oppressed, not minorities specifically.  Some minorities just happen to also be oppressed.
t1_dt9xvhk	0	*	No because this is an improvement for both sexes, that would be the opposite.  I will always be against backwards moves irregardless of who they affect.
t1_dt9ut1b	0	*	Yes, the highest *successful* suicide rate. But treating that as the only important metric is really dumb. You need to address the factors and illnesses that bring people to that point.
t1_dtaqkoe	0	*	I don't think you're capable of determining that. You might *feel* right. But just because stuff feels true doesn't mean it is. You need to back stuff up with actual reasoning not wannabelieve. 
t1_dt9qepe	0	*	How specifically are boys disadvantaged?

t1_duib4kc	0	*	The $10 interest is taxed? When you take it out?  I don't get it?  So all I'm seeing is that people want to screw over people who invest for their retirement? That seems so incredibly short sighted.
t1_dui83hv	1	*	Justice.  That's what separates government from a mafia.  Libertarians don't like to acknowledge this fact because their idea of justice is so assbackwards compared to societies.

t1_dui9nza	0	*	rural Wisconsin. I have to drive 2 hours to a decent grocery store though, so there are trade offs. 
t1_duio5qq	1	*	it varies and depending on your situation. you can make 131k have no property, live in a high cost of living state and have barely any deductions. so it depends where you live and your situation.
t1_duib6ze	0	*	> Sure I don't have children,  well there it is... your 20% saving will turn to 0 when you have kids if you were on the same wage
t1_duitzht	0	*	My point is that everyone is ok with raising taxes for those rich bastards hoping that the raise won't hurt them.
t1_dui8enn	1	*	Not where I live and not the part of the country I live. Its going in that route but family farms are not a myth here.
t1_dui8d5m	0	*	Elections, due process, and checks and balances come to mind.
t1_duian4q	0	*	Most people make the mighty fine assumption they will even reach that level of wealth to be unfairly taxed  or t their children somehow deserve that same leg up for winning the genetic lotto.
t1_dui9zaw	0	*	Would you rather he just remain an asshole screwing over people's lives and never changing? I can name at least one right now.  
t1_duixrni	0	*	Fair enough , but i mean we shouldn't have to accept community college when you're making tjat much. You should be making more. Everyone should be 
t1_duic2yc	0	*	I don't hate Obama lol. I think he did many good things. I just can't stand how all of a sudden reddit magically cares about the deficit because it fits their narrative now.
t1_duiaz9e	0	*	I feel for you if you actually have other people living with you. 3br in 500sqft is tight living quarters man. 
t1_duic4gz	0	*	Also, you're*   Ironic from someone telling me to get educated
t1_duibhuq	1	*	Give a man a valley of gold and he will ask for another. Give him a second and he will ask for a third. Nothing can fill this hole except the dust of the grave. 
t1_duiel04	1	*	Yeah, that sounds pretty humble.
t1_duibl49	0	*	Of course the US government is corrupt. I never said it wasn't. Good try though. Also, if we're gonna play that game: point me to a single human institution that isn't corrupted in some way.
t1_duievs3	0	*	No, I'm saying that having an extremely high rate incentives additional loophole usage that may not have been worth the risk or effort previously. 
t1_duib3ie	1	*	Social Security benefits for most people are larger than they would receive from investing an equivalent amount. That's why ongoing tax renevues are required to pay SS benefits.
t1_duibjin	0	*	They dont even own a home for the fire department to protect. Why would they need to pay property tax?
t1_duibseg	0	*	If you make 150k / year, 1k for rent is nothing at all.

t1_dui9kwt	0	*	My 2br: 1900/month
t1_duiet4e	1	*	No, because you add value by managing them and doing your own job. Coordination has it's own value, but Bill Gates isn't managing the cleaners.

t1_duiacx8	1	*	The important difference being that yachts are non-essential and education is essential...
t1_duia1fb	0	*	Nice website. After living in NYC and surrounding area for over 20 years, I know it is false. Households aren't raking in 150k as a standard.
t1_duichef	0	*	Any evidence for Trump paying a higher percent? Cause he kinda didn't release his tax returns
t1_dui946t	1	*	>  that it's often ~~better~~ required to have both adults join the workforce  
t1_duih826	0	*	Why arent most students eligible to file independently? Would taking a year off to work a minimum wage job allow them to file independently?
t1_duiokao	1	*	>  let's keep it close to even for the amount put into it.  Functional impossibility. Thank you for showing me how far out of your depth you're talking. 
t1_dui81qu	0	*	I'm not trying to say that people shouldn't try to make money. I'm saying that our economic system is broken because if you're that rich there needs to be some wealth distribution.
t1_dui2tox	1	*	Once again you are completely flopping around on what you are talking about. Too many people on too many tangents.
t1_duimu4g	0	*	But you expect the most vulnerable and in need of those services to make that bet?
t1_duiizew	0	*	back2T_D
t1_duibor1	1	*	Oh okay, that's how it sounded to me. Yeah I agree, rich people don't always exploit others. 
t1_duibtbg	0	*	For the people they hire to move them, yes it will be a lot more work, but to the people moving its just a slightly higher moving bill and a slightly longer stay at a first class hotel. 
t1_duifnb3	0	*	You could renounce your US citizenship, like people already threaten to do but are unlikely to *actually* do.
t1_duiawc5	0	*	Hence the second part of my post. 
t1_duifs4u	0	*	Im not sure where your data is from but the avg household income is around $50k so Im not sure that $60k is in the top 20%.
t1_duiaye6	0	*	Yes I maxed my 401k. I put in $18k (my employer matches at 50% so they put in another $9k)  We max our HSA and max our Roth IRAs ($11k for the 2 of us)  My wife doesn't work or we'd max her 401k too
t1_duia5t1	1	*	the fundamental difference is consent. 
t1_duidhtl	1	*	Ok, fair enough. What do you think the goal of tax policy should be?  I think it shoukd be to maximize government revenue.
t1_dwxlx3r	0	*	I feel like you don't remember the beginning of this conversation, nor how you merely said the equivalent of nu-uh as a response.
t1_duib339	0	*	How do you fit 3 bedrooms in 500sqft? Is it literally just 3 rooms?
t1_duiaizg	1	*	If my adjusted gross income was $130k you'd be right. My gross income was 130k but my AGI was $72,300.  How do you feel when you're corrected after making such a wrong assumption? 
t1_duiddx8	0	*	Ok, so what exactly do you propose we cut? I would agree that spending tens of billions on a worthless wall is a useless expenditure. What else would you do to justify not increasing taxes on the top?
t1_dui6qk9	0	*	Neither Medicare, Medicaid, or social security funding was effected by the tax cuts.   I think military spending would be fine after being reduced some. 
t1_dui94f4	0	*	I don't think that a small wealth tax will entirely eliminate investment.  If you're arguing that it would be reduced, then I agree.
t1_dui9pyz	1	*	It is kind of amusing that some libertarians have gone so deep into it theyve transformed into monarchists.  
t1_duiak4b	0	*	Ok well then how do you think you reduce the cost of education? With more funding which comes from taxes.
t1_duiio4v	1	*	If you think LA sucks try Bay Area.
t1_duibf95	1	*	A system that selects for the strongest in the eyes of people who see life as a video game. This is accurate.
t1_duib15l	0	*	That's literally my point. Popular vote for a figurehead that looks pretty while a Parliament controls the rest.
t1_dujqmv4	0	*	We are all entitled to the taxes collected from everybody. That's what our society is built on.
t1_dui85la	1	*	Well, I agree that it would reduce investment, so the question would be if a balance could be achieved between raising revenue and minimizing distortion.
t1_duie9hz	1	*	They also pay 90% of the taxes.  So, again, how is that not fair?
t1_dui8ojb	1	*	 You're the one perpetuating a fairy tale but go ahead keep it up. 
t1_duzx2w6	0	*	Did I say anything about the housing crisis?  No, I didn't.  So stop bringing that up and trying to get me to defend a point I never made you snake.   You're completely full of it. 
t1_duzm3l1	0	*	So do you believe theirs never been an actual Communist State?   As the USSR is also on there.

t1_duebbcv	1	*	right
t1_dt1vog1	1	*	Id love to talk about them, but this article is about Turkey. And its about Turkey doing things that has been repeated so many times in history. Hence, relevant.

t1_dtf9iqz	0	*	Yes but you said everyone would suffocate at around the year 2100. IIRC there is still oxygen in the atmosphere to sustain everyone for thousands of years, even without new production.

t1_dterdkw	1	*	Totally agreeing with you.
t1_dterp88	0	*	Bullshit. 100 searches consume as much as a 60 watt lightbulb being on for 30 minutes.  Or at least thats what they say. 
t1_dtelisv	1	*	See your edit about water? I can buy American bottled water in my supermarket. It's cheaper to ship it across the Pacific  (3 cents) than bottle it locally.
t1_ducsa3g	1	*	Vertical*
t1_dudf9au	0	*	> Also, plant based food sources will be susceptible to climate change  What do you think animals eat? You put no thought into this statement whatsoever. 
t1_dshaa10	1	*	better than believing a newsweek article.
t1_dsi1ghb	1	*	> Sanctions work. Words of a liar and bigmouth, not really.  The article at the top literally addresses this point.
t1_dshpx3s	0	*	You: Trump shouldn't be nominated because I think he's a sexist or racist.  Also you: Yasser Arafat is a hero for murdering Jews.
t1_dsi5tus	1	*	Lol, ok. These things, none of them work like you think they do. You should probably switch hobbies.
t1_dshp5lp	1	*	Seoul is not in range of most of the border artillery. I recall only the biggest (and fewest in number, and most easily found) guns can reach the suburbs.

t1_dsiscfy	1	*	Thanks, I sincerely couldn't tell

t1_dtcsejz	0	*	>then you are probably a terrible person and no one on reddit will convince you to care.    
t1_dtcvry8	0	*	I would love to see your source on a couple feet lol. I've seen research that says there's not a relationship between climate change, and natural storms.

t1_dtdgqeo	1	*	Soy Beaner Street?
t1_dtcljh8	1	*	That's my point.  Clearing land is 10x cheaper than investing in vertical farming.  The land is uninhabited.  
t1_dtco2e3	1	*	I don't think saying easy stuff, like spaghetti implies they only ever eat spaghetti. And even if it does, it doesn't cover how they prepare it or what goes into it.
t1_dtcv249	0	*	Yeah but I don't think there's  one specific American bbq,sauce you can find all over the world. Maybe Kraft bbq sauce? Fuckin hope not  
t1_dtcrrqw	0	*	If you must troll, at least switch it up a little. Four comments about how much you like milk just signals a lack of imagination.

t1_dtctkab	0	*	Yes you're utterly demented to think humans are ruining the planet. I'm sorry but how stupid do you have to be to imply anyone doesn't care about the planet? Every human on the planet cares.
t1_dtdirdp	1	*	Glad you're trying at least!
t1_dtd3cuv	0	*	The animals still need grazing land, feed, water, etc just like the animals raised for meat. Those environmental issues don't just disappear because they aren't being raised for meat.

t1_duqw1is	1	*	Yeah. Unnamed sources, which no one else has heard of.  Always the best sources.  
t1_dug3k9w	0	*	the dice disappeared into a singularity and was replaced with a jagged strip of wood with a -1 etched into its surface
t1_dug7maw	1	*	Not to mention the sheer number of people on board. 20 dudes on a motorboat aren't taking over a US navy aircraft carrier. Period.
t1_duxbsiw	0	*	I'm so smart I can tell everyone there is a problem but I'm not smart enough to come up with a solution. What a smell there is here...

t1_dupbiqi	1	*	Awesome.
t1_dux0t83	0	*	Yes, which is why its the only drug i do now. It is harmless compared to my past vices.  But im very well educated when it comes to drugs.

t1_duqqqup	1	*	ya its pretty hilarious people are sceptical that russia was involved, running drugs out of countries is kind of what super powers do
t1_dupm9ye	1	*	Hi basehead!

t1_dtozv39	0	*	SU-25 entered service in 1975, pretty sure the intel we have on it at this point is accurate. It's not like we're talking about a state-of-the-art Russian fighter full of national secrets....
t1_dtos1s7	0	*	Are you sure the A-10 has a pressurized cockpit?
t1_dtph1zt	0	*	You may want to look up information on Allied air raids of Germany and Japan. Especially the bombings of Dresden and Tokyo.
t1_dtpw480	1	*	You don't really shoot and run. You'd know if you killed them
t1_dtp1ib6	0	*	The absurdity of it all. Hey, you just bombed the fuck out of us, killed my 30 friends, but now that you are out of a plane, you're safe. No way that holds. 
t1_dtp2zwx	1	*	Yeah nah
t1_dtozrli	1	*	The Hague convention then.
t1_dtopao8	0	*	Which worked out well in WWI
t1_dtpoxoj	1	*	To be fair, he won the Peace Prize _before_ launching airstrikes, and said no backsies.
t1_dtp2l9q	0	*	I just want to get this straight, you think randomly bombing civilian targets with no strategic value is a good thing?  Because that's whats happening in those two places right now. 
t1_dton4ms	0	*	Actually helicopters are pretty fragile, and you could feasibly down one just by shooting at it and getting lucky 
t1_dtqj88i	0	*	I think the Japanese at the time distributed propaganda in the same way most governments do during unpopular wars.
t1_dtplmja	1	*	I mean, no US sniper has been above 150. So the fact he Damn near doubled it is impressive.  He eliminated AT LEAST 250 people off of earth. That is impressive for a sniper, even in war.
t1_dtp1x6a	1	*	you'd think they would bias specs in the other direction, to create a false sense of comfort
t1_dtom457	0	*	Yup, i've edited it to correct myself.
t1_dton49o	1	*	> I'm gonna shoot this at a helicopter and cause some serious damage.   Definitely.
t1_dtoz61s	0	*	Lol, velcro and zippers are only so good, man. There's a reason why western aeronautics have leaned harder on drones.

t1_dtp1e9a	1	*	Rarely. 
t1_dtozqyc	1	*	Your assertions are worth very little without credible evidence.
t1_dtots2c	0	*	Fair enough.  But if I had wanted to comment on the Syrian side of this, I would have.  And I would have been clear about it.
t1_dtpd31h	0	*	Wonderful response. You made the claim, back yourself or admit it was made up.   Perhaps its because you know 2/5^ths of fuck all about history and you havent got a leg to stand on. 
t1_dtoqa5y	0	*	What Russian ww2 crimes are you talking about?
t1_dtoprqj	0	*	Yeah. Lybia used to be one of the most prosperous countries in Africa. Now its a shithole thanks to US and its allies. 
t1_dtpkjyv	1	*	I think the Germans rationalized it as theyll lift the lids off the poison gas containers and then the wind would do the actual killing. You know, crazy people rationalization. 
t1_dtp0hvv	1	*	Lol and you are someone who thinks that there is something honorable in murdering civilians by the hundreds and the thousands so long as you get one bad guy.
t1_dtpy4u5	1	*	How could a group of rebels argue misidentification on a pilot parachuting down when it's a war crime to kill a surrendered soldier in any situation?
t1_dsfaef7	0	*	I agree that BJP sunk the bill. But let's not pretend the Congress is good. All of them have only paid lip service to the LGBT cause. 
t1_dsdn0o8	0	*	Or even better, place a $0.01 tax on every trade (not per share, per transaction).
t1_dsemalm	1	*	I don't have an answer for you.
t1_dse5v1e	1	*	Haha, didn't realize you were going back into the dinosaur ages :P  Well, we all know how that turned out. The power miners have over Bitcoin is another reason I moved away from that space.
t1_dseq2v4	1	*	Vote is weighed by the amount of money you got in it.
t1_dsemcsz	0	*	hahaha I'm sure you're going to tell all your pals at the pedophile country club how you spent half the night trying to convince a stranger on reddit how rich you are
t1_dsfajmg	1	*	Yes it does.  You're paying for hardware and electricity and opportunity.

t1_dsdhczz	1	*	I'd rather live in an apartment in a city with good public transport
t1_dselyhs	0	*	The amount of coffee used depends on the method of brewing.  A typical drip coffee maker calls for 1-2 tablespoons per cup.  The normal recommendation for a french press is 2 tablespoons per cup.
t1_dsdgz4a	1	*	How was this helpful?  
t1_dse18yi	0	*	Youre forgetting most people arwn selling 
t1_dse2w11	0	*	cornering and manipulating the market would be extremely profitable.  combined with stake grinding, it would seem that such manipulation would be impossible to stop.
t1_dsetwle	1	*	I would say it was still a fair distribution. XRB was worthless when it was distributed. They didn't do an ICO. So it was by no means a cash grab.
t1_dse2m3r	1	*	It just won the vote as the next coin to be added to Binance so if you want to wait a week or two it will be on there too.
t1_dse0gq3	1	*	And satoshi was a team of one people.
t1_dsdgvio	0	*	I wasn't looking for a way to make my comment less redundant.  
t1_dsdxzm3	0	*	[KuCoin](https://www.kucoin.com/#/?r=1ed3a) (referral link) has it, as does BitGrail. BitGrail has the most volume but it's kinda sucky.

t1_dtmpblu	1	*	Lol ignorance is bliss to you I take it. Keep saying the US is the bad guy.
t1_dtmn6yf	0	*	Our disgusting habits of mining uranium to produce nuclear energy which is far cleaner than coal plants. Why would the EU want to trade with such disgusting habits!  You are ridiculous.

t1_dtmznf3	0	*	Yea, buf if you look at many comments here, you can figure that many people don't have a diverse array of sources.
t1_dtml42c	1	*	If you read the source Wikipedia quotes, you'll see that it's wrong
t1_dtmmw4a	0	*	What do YOU think is going on? Do you honestly believe the US has not advanced environmental protection?
t1_dtmmznw	0	*	>He actually is NOT relevant in THIS matter because trade negotiations happen at the EU level.  He actually is RELEVANT in THIS matter since EU needs national governments to implement any deal.
t1_dtmnmxu	1	*	but all EU members hold a veto on new trade deals so if the french government sets this as their red line it's by proxy an EU red line.
t1_dtmrklf	1	*	and any EU country got veto
t1_dtn9ebt	0	*	...you do know that not all iPhones head to the US right? They only send what's needed for the US market. They ship direct from Foxconn in China to other markets. Europe will still get Iphones lol.
t1_dtmrh3z	0	*	I already have a bunch of old VMs I don't use. It would take just a few extra minutes for someone who has the same.
t1_dtml19l	1	*	I guess they were trying to say congressmen are legislative while the sos is executive?
t1_dtms18q	1	*	I was referring to Germany who has a hard on for selling Arabs weapons just as the US does.

t1_dtmqhuv	1	*	Isn't his office the one holding France's vote on the EU-level voting on the matter, tho?
t1_dtn568f	1	*	How are you offended by what I said?   It's a fact we are now going down an isolationist path.
t1_dtnjupp	1	*	Whataboutism
t1_dtml6zc	1	*	No. Congressmen form the legislative body (Assemblxe9e nationale+Sxe9nat). The government form the executive power (PM, ministers, secretaries of state).
t1_dturfan	1	*	Looking at it again, it may be a separate story? Hard to tell on desktop if it's another header for a subsection, or another article....weird though. I just scrolled and control F search
t1_dsgu4c9	1	*	Its not my explanation, the other verses confirm that. And its not 'slaves' its more like servants(who were POW's). Allah infact encourages freeing of slaves(see Bilal).

t1_dua5j6r	0	*	Uh, and?

t1_ds8fd4g	0	*	Why would Iran allow Indian soldiers to pass through it's border.

t1_dtns4g5	0	*	You're mistaken friend, I think that's a bullock.  I figured we were talking about that country in the Balkans, near Serbia.

t1_dtxoqj4	0	*	Lots. Uk, Austria, Australia, Germany, Switzerland, Danmark, Norway, Sweden to mention a few I know intimately.
t1_du14laa	1	*	Even if true, the report (that a million papers have reproduced) said Israel gives $5,000 a month to a group, and possibly a few more. That isn't massive aid.  You have quite the flair for hyperbole.

t1_dusljdo	1	*	They only struggled because they only sent scout legion and Tullius. Had they sent an actual Legion, they would've steamrolled the Stormcloaks. 
t1_dusm02m	1	*	I'd say its ridiculous to believe a border wall is going to stop illegal immigration.  Its about as silly as the drug war stopping drugs. Or tougher prisons stopping crime.

t1_duso1kt	1	*	I think avocadoes for one since they are seasonal, and they are already pretty fucking expensive because of it.
t1_duw2t54	0	*	I suppose it only makes sense. It is the largest export. I vote we line both sides of the wall with dead cartel members. Sound good?

t1_dusistq	0	*	Spending the wall money on those things instead of an ineffective bit of security theater would be a much better use for it. Especially in light of the absurd deficit Congress has just approved.

t1_dsouf05	0	*	But you literally did.
t1_dsptd4u	1	*	> In both countries a lot of people go to college as a way to kill time before the inevitable ten-year-plus spell of unemployment.  Sounds a bit like the west.
t1_dtogqtf	0	*	What?
t1_dtqe1pv	0	*	Im pro-gun, and I even know that it's downplaying the need for safety. It's basically making it out to be something like a screwdriver, when in reality, its purpose is to kill whatever it is aimed at.
t1_dtqj0ba	0	*	 This is the weirdest comparison
t1_dul899o	0	*	Yes that is who decriminilization helps. But who does it hurt?
t1_dukywgr	0	*	Yeah he cries virtue signaling, but hes overreacting just the same so he can feel superior. Its toxic 
t1_dul0wdk	1	*	Thank you, it wasn't necessarily unexpected... But the,timing was surprising.
t1_dulav9s	1	*	This but without the I'm jokingpart. He can literally say and do whatever he wants without a single bit of opposition. He's *literally murdering* drug users and dealers in the streets.
t1_dulb6c9	1	*	Oh just cut your dick off (and don't worry, it won't make you lose your purpose; the notion will be a gift to humanity instead)

t1_dv395sg	1	*	lol... ya those morocan jews were treated so well.. nothing like a a few mega joules of radiation to the skull to make em toe the line eh?  Watch Ringworm children documentary.
t1_dv2vwvh	0	*	Hamas rockets arent aimed at military targets so they are not collateral damage.  but nice of you to support terrorism I didn't expect any less from genocide you did to aboriginals!
t1_dv34zwy	0	*	1929 is 1 example of years before Israel was founded..
t1_dv2yndv	0	*	So your argument is that genocide is okay if it's against Jews ... got it. 
t1_dv30z8v	0	*	You mean the UN literally creating a country, and then that country rapidly pushing out millions of people who have been there for 5 generations isn't enough context for you?

t1_dv1k8ab	0	*	You claimed that Russia didn't have involvement in Syria until 2012.  This is obviously false.

t1_dtbfler	1	*	Haven't we covered that? The entire thread is about the why not.
t1_dta9qvu	1	*	Was in Tsumeb, Namibia, Africa for a week and had work out of town. We had to go a few times in the dark to the worksite and I'll never forget that night sky.
t1_dt9tnnn	0	*	In fairness, it's not permanent. It was poorly conceived, but it's not awful.
t1_dtacm76	0	*	Oh I take back what I say about the disco ball. I didn't know it was the Electron that launched it. Then yes, both are the same. Case closed I was wrong. 
t1_dtaoxvm	0	*	So it wasnt burnt toast, but steamed ham you smelled.  Of course the simpsons did it.
t1_duz0jzy	0	*	How convenient.  Occupy people indefinitely but don't give them any rights.  Again reminds me of South Africa back in the day.
t1_du9wi4s	0	*	i wasnt serious, the dude in the first comment wants animal abusers in Korea to be arrested because of dogs, even though this happens to our animals in the US
t1_ds2lbme	0	*	Curious which crimes shes been convicted of?? Surely the dozen or so republican investigations would have found something...
t1_ds3ti98	1	*	That's according to you. The general consensus in a free country is that anyone can become a political activist. In Iran, you must conform to specific standards by the ayatollah. 
t1_du39msv	0	*	Trans females have higher testosterone levels and cis females.
t1_du5y8ar	0	*	He didn't need to.

t1_du8f54s	0	*	You can go to Calgary,Winnipeg, Saskatoon, St. John's, Ottawa... all have dirt cheap housing. but noooooo... you think you are entitled to be able to afford Vancouver just because you are a Canadian
t1_du925rs	0	*	unrealistic and politically unpopular in Canada, won't ever happen, the 3 main political parties, plus the senate, and the supreme court won't allow it.
t1_du92g86	1	*	Solid DD. 
t1_du8zxnn	0	*	It doesn't happen necessarily that the shell people - usually working poor etc. will live in the properties that they own. 
t1_du8ffr3	0	*	Yup. People like that guy are why Reddit can be frustrating sometimes. Too dumb for their own good, but they have a snappy quip so they feel super smrt. 
t1_du8ei07	0	*	Well if no one wants to limit foreign investment and freedom of movement look at solving the problem from a different angle.
t1_du8u5ya	1	*	Being satirical.
t1_du9v3v3	1	*	We should do the same in canada one property per foreigner for self occupancy
t1_dtubamo	0	*	Fewer
t1_dtvl43e	1	*	I am. That doesn't mean that I believe that the ruling party are naively introducing the bill purely to ban the singular phrase, rather than to achieve sweeping revisionism.
t1_dtwvhl8	1	*	I've addressed these issues under other comments.
t1_dtvw8vt	1	*	> all of these people who died during holocaust.  Fuck no. That's an incredibly cheesy and presumptuous thing to say.
t1_dtvllwb	0	*	So again your argument boils down to no you know much better about Poland pre WW2 and anti-semitism, than Jews living in Poland pre WW2.
t1_dtuaipn	0	*	Im pretty sure more than 350 poles hated Jews in the 1930s. 
t1_dtvl54i	1	*	Deciding to no longer honor vile people isn't historical revisionism.  That's like saying Germany shouldn't have changed its Nazi symbols in public spaces because omg that's historical revisionism.
t1_dtwh9bh	0	*	Its not coming up under google. Translational error or something mate?  There is no IWCC
t1_dtyakoy	1	*	Some individual Jews, just like some individual Poles killed Jews. 
t1_dtven4r	1	*	That's why we educate instead of criminalizing speech.
t1_dtugi8j	1	*	That's the complete opposite of what Halo is advocating.
t1_dtup6wn	1	*	My original statement was simply that nicotine has been shown to help. I did not recommend replacing treatment plans. A vape is a quick delivery comfort mechanism. Not a treatment plan. 
t1_dtvmtva	1	*	I think soda addicts are usually caffeine addicts in addition anyway. Caffeine is in most soft drinks.
t1_dtvqt6r	1	*	Have you seen a fatty that craves his sugar? He would kill for his hit if he could get up from his sofa
t1_dtusc72	0	*	i know, i was agreeing with you... their entire defense was illogical, hostile, and borderline sociopathic
t1_dtvgk57	1	*	Idc tbh
t1_dtv7o9m	1	*	There are assholes of all walks of life, including some who vape. A guy wearing a green shirt was once really rude to me, but I didn't develop a prejudice over shirt colour.
t1_dtvixaz	1	*	Mhm. Not mad or bitter at all using insults and harping on word choice
t1_dssglry	1	*	Same procedure. Cuter name.
t1_dtzwkj0	0	*	So basically, you have no idea how FISA warrants work but because Trump's name wasn't plastered all over it you think it can't be true. How nice to be that ignorant.
t1_dtg7apr	0	*	Canadians require ID to vote. All developed nations do, except the US for some reason.
t1_dtfc4la	0	*	I am not for super pacs.  Now back to the topic.   Do you believe a government should be free to be a propaganda arm in other countries elections? 
t1_dteyopa	0	*	No seriously. What were you trying to say? 
t1_du9eo7d	0	*	The main purpose is to have a decentralized currency (not controlled by government). Other side purpose would be fast world wide transaction with little/no fees.
t1_du98x9m	0	*	Gamerghazi? It's turned into some SRS-lite political sub at this point now that GamerGate finally died.
t1_duacjut	1	*	Pretty much correct, and if drastic changes have to be made a soft or hard fork are options. 
t1_du9ehle	0	*	It's purpose is to be a decentralized currency, not under the control of any government or agency... Maybe do some research so you know what you are talking about for fuck sakes
t1_dutk9vd	0	*	So why you a communist bro? 
t1_duu5f1u	1	*	No, but entertainment.
t1_dskt37d	1	*	You have a weird view of history. Look up the partition plans.
t1_dskxtah	0	*	> the parents of the child are also victims.  They were straight up arrogant. Yes, they were victims and it's tragic, but *maybe* they shouldn't have been so arrogant.
t1_dskkspf	1	*	To the people they represent, Jews and Israelis are interchangeable terms.  Context is key

t1_dt78gbz	1	*	We have him one degree from Paul Manafort. 
t1_dt9ujb0	0	*	Hey, you chose Reuters as a source to back your argument that the tax cuts were a positive thing, so I don't know why you're attacking your own source.
t1_dt9x4hm	1	*	I still don't understand why it isn't built with Defense Department funds.  Walls are defensive structures and the Army corps of engineers exist.
t1_dtaqvfq	0	*	Seriously? Maddow is like the Hannity of the left. It's all gotcha pieces to push a narrative.
t1_dtb1c8i	0	*	Show us the most recent segment where Maddow is sincerely happy about one of trump's policies.
t1_dt9wrj9	0	*	So it doesn't concern you at all that the new tax cuts without any mitigation will increase the national debt? 
t1_dtagme3	0	*	And that is stopping people from speaking how? Also last I saw he didn't fire Mueller. 
t1_dtbseia	1	*	Yeah, just like huffpo....... The fact that you are so blind to it just proves that you are just as much as a blind sheep as the people on the right you despise.
t1_dtb1eju	1	*	Don't make me pull out the Russian card to win the argument sir.
t1_dt9w40n	1	*	I dont think being like two years old counts lol. I was born in 85 and I barely remember Bush Sr

t1_dt8ptz2	0	*	You're saying the only way of training an animal that you've ever heard of, is cause it pain of it doesn't do what you say?
t1_dt8owdq	0	*	I'm glad you admit you have no idea what you're talking about
t1_dt84psc	0	*	All that tells me is you build a shitty fence.  My neighbour manages to keep his big male aggro German Shepherd behind a 6 foot fence with a small topper no worries.
t1_dt85odh	0	*	I only hit my wife lightly so it's ok'
t1_dt8541c	0	*	Now that we both know the truth lets stick some metal in those fancy holes in the wall with the switches and see who hurts the least. You first.
t1_dt8r1e5	0	*	> I'd rather zap the dog than have the dog attack someone, run away, etc.   So they're saying it's cause pain, or the dog will run away and/or attack someone.
t1_dtyyy9m	0	*	The police don't have free speech? I thought you said everyone in America has free speech? 
t1_dtz8m58	0	*	Article is literal Russian propaganda.  There is a reason Russia was pushing pro BLM content in and around St. LOUIS and Baltimore through Facebook and other social media.
t1_dtzawok	0	*	Maybe we should round them up and gas them, eh? 
t1_dtzfsj3	1	*	So they can't have an opinion about facts now?
t1_dtzcucs	0	*	That's not Democracy then though...
t1_dtzeb2a	1	*	That's fantastic, but now you've taken up his claim and are now smartassing on his behalf, so I really don't care who you are.
t1_dtzfvhj	0	*	Why is it not an opinion? An opinion is not an opinion if it's wrong?
t1_dtzxmr9	1	*	Source?
t1_dtz6b3s	0	*	An idea doesnt become a crime until it is put into effect. Laws may change before that happens, though. Thats the point of politics. If the laws change, then its no longer a crime. 
t1_dtyyujm	0	*	Expressing your desires is not against the law in the US. As for the plans, that goes a bit beyond speech and expression, no? Plans are about action, not about expression.
t1_duwxch3	1	*	It = It      Ive always enjoyed math and philosophy. 
t1_due25al	0	*	None, still in my 30s
t1_dtx0xf8	1	*	I don't think is has been co-opted to mean something bad so much as people are finally (thanks to the Internet) learning what Zionism is.
t1_dtwpo3r	0	*	The guy has no idea what he's talking about or is simply misinforming due to having an agenda. Bennett is about as far right as you can get, but nobody in Israel wants to commit genocide on Arabs.
t1_dtws21i	0	*	This is unironically the world I want to live in.
t1_dtwnxsu	1	*	I think his being a hardcore religious has a lot to do with it.
t1_dtwrtmc	0	*	Bennett has let his distaste for Palestinians be know. Even said they should all be dead. I still like him for everything else, though. 
t1_dtwvuhh	0	*	I was having a little fun, but do stay butthurt about this incredibly serious comment chain
t1_dtwo8z4	0	*	Yes, settling Fatah territory sure hurts Hamas.

t1_dtwtdk9	1	*	Great answer mate!  thanks for answering in such detail! :)

t1_dtwnr9q	0	*	Essentially.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roof_knocking
t1_dtwvw5l	0	*	Promoting uplifting language is the opposite of self-righteous. It's LORD-righteous. 
t1_dtww192	1	*	I don't disagree with you on the socialist part.  Shit I think socialism is a big part of Zionism.  I was more saying I am your stereotypical american socialist.

t1_dsgjf0d	0	*	> allowed the banks to give bonuses to the people who caused the crisis.  So you agree it was unregulated bankers that caused the crisis. The bailout is irrelevant to that fact.

t1_dsh12cv	0	*	Repeating a pointless question doesn't make for a fun discussion. Try next time on a new account, I'm putting this one on ignore.
t1_dsgyrcc	1	*	what are you talking about? 
t1_dsi9hi5	0	*	More like just abusing people's cognitive and emotional weaknesses. As usual.  It's hard to tell what's not mental illness in the present society.
t1_dsgi4ha	0	*	Hell, clearly Jesus is always on a coffee break because I don't think conservatives would like his policies very much.
t1_dsgtcah	1	*	haha. excellent point!
t1_dsgyjv8	1	*	Privatize the gains, nationalize the losses. 
t1_dsgsfww	1	*	Greece, Spain, Portugal 
t1_dsgsccd	1	*	_probably_ paid a big price for it... Unless you can see other timelines...
t1_dsgji8o	1	*	Word of mouth over a long period of time.
t1_dsh2nao	1	*	Yep but this is the common saying among evangelicals. 
t1_dsgnn3z	1	*	This hilarious, and likely factually accurate, comment is not getting anywhere near enough love.
t1_dsinpni	1	*	Paul Ryan wants to cut Health Care benefits, he had survivor benefits because his father died when he was 15.
t1_dsgmflm	1	*	And McDonald's with diet Coke
t1_dsh0qk6	0	*	They hate Jews but love Israel... because Israel is the key to bringing Jesus back to earth.
t1_dsgw908	0	*	The fact you were downvoted for that says literally everything you need to know. These people aren't living in reality. It truly makes things easier in the end. 
t1_dsgljeg	1	*	It's not about what I prefer.
t1_dsgv004	1	*	I'm speaking to the fact that Trump will rubber-stamp sign whatever bills they give him, not whether or not Congress can actually pass anything to begin with.
t1_dsgqycm	0	*	Who holds that note?
t1_dsgipy9	1	*	I was playing the long con.  You couldn't see it?
t1_dsgmhze	1	*	Do you actually have a point?
t1_dshc4gw	0	*	So absolutely nothing was changed.
t1_dshas1q	1	*	Welcome to current day America.
t1_dshta8x	0	*	Then that is a pointless thing to say.  Everyone tells a lie eventually.  That is like saying everyone coughs.
t1_dshul6c	1	*	I thought we were talking about Clinton. She's been investigated by far more agencies for far longer than Trump. If anyone's guilty, she is. She'd be in jail if it weren't for the lying media.
t1_dsmmria	0	*	It is not separate,it is a continued conversation, so the context of waving flags was in protest... 
t1_dutd5ag	0	*	There are Christian, Jewish and Muslim Palestinians 
t1_dudqf46	1	*	Right, but that's a bullshit claim because we clearly are concerned.

t1_dudja1n	1	*	lol, ok mate
t1_dud5uh5	0	*	Evidence?
t1_ducxtnb	1	*	or basically any other, what specifically has changed in our policy of when to authorize drone strikes? I believe over 90% of deaths under obama were civilians 
t1_dtkktl8	1	*	I'm not in Asia but I'll call the president right away and tell him to do just that. Let me grab my phone!  I can't believe you killed all those people at Virginia Tech! How dare you?  Troll

t1_dsexgoi	0	*	You're an ass
t1_dsei36u	0	*	Your being an asshole and I hope you don't talk or treat people like this in person. 
t1_dsebjxl	0	*	You are thinking of ICBMs. Nukes can be built with centrifuges and a Wiki, ICBMs are hard.
t1_dsebws9	0	*	I got it. I know whats at stake and a full on regime change is our best hope but I dont trust SK to handle it. I just wish I had more information
t1_dsek08o	1	*	Well, I can't say what else we lose but for sure world standing would be the first thing gone.
t1_dulric6	1	*	Oh really? I'm actually studying myth construction in Greece at the moment, so I kind of have to explain the same thing
t1_dumiv6z	1	*	oh, when 80+% of the population is some religion, you gotta tolerate a bit of bias. Though there is a difference between a small focus and indoctrination and emphasis.
t1_dulabon	0	*	Well you should watch it it's quite interesting.
t1_dumiwej	1	*	OHHH, thanks. Derp - I often misunderstand online comments.

t1_dsejzs3	0	*	I did actually. Im German, there wasnt really a way around it when it was published back in the day, but its not especially memorable to me. Why do you ask?
t1_dseoogp	1	*	I dont think star wars lore is an example of good writing either. Doesnt have to be good writing to be entertaining of course.
t1_dv2oc6q	0	*	You weren't Canadians yet so technically it didn't. Kinda like people who try to pretend genocide didn't happen until they invented the word. 
t1_dv1z51a	0	*	>and many of them were not British at all.   they were all british. everyone living in the english colonies in america was british.  You're just arguing for argument's sake, at this point.
t1_dv3fpv5	0	*	No air defence system is capable of defeating swarms of cheap robots. This is why drone warfare is terrifying 
t1_dv26b8g	0	*	That still has nothing to do with the comment I initially replied to though; which was about trump supporters in Canada. Why are you starting a fight over this? Lol
t1_dv2o26b	0	*	> so insistent on lying about Canada having   well, as i originally said, canada, as an entity, didn't even *exist* in 1812, so i don't see how it could have involvement in anything

t1_dtenymq	1	*	Fair enough U0001f601
t1_ds22xdj	1	*	We all know it's not the truth. He's full of shit, never helped refugees, unless you mean where he helped train a refugee at Starbucks to make brewed coffee. 
t1_dstyu9l	0	*	There's multiple version of IQ
t1_dss4sat	1	*	because EQ is pop culture BS. we already have a way to describe this 
t1_dsyq394	0	*	So your answer to powerty wages is whelp, should have landed in the x% with the ability, means, and ressources to pursue a high paying career. Tough shit for everyone else ? 
t1_dtacipz	1	*	No one gets it. Theres nothing to get, all you nerds think you're in some cute little exclusive club because you found a cartoon to justify watching well in to your mid 30s 
t1_dst88vn	0	*	If one's reading comprehension is at a very low level, possibly.  But most Trump voters have left /r/worldnews.
t1_dssie5i	1	*	Richard and Mortimer is a heavily nuanced show, only truly understood by the most brilliant minds in all the land.  Prithee, did you get it? 
t1_dstq2vb	1	*	I never said it was knowledge itself, so I assumed that wasn't the point you were making. I said the concepts of knowledge and intelligence were conflated.

t1_dswbhps	0	*	Any decent human.
t1_dswcfnk	1	*	Obviously not everyone would do it, people would be against it, even likely protest it.  This is great. It will create so many jobs and give people a new reason to bitch. Literally everyone wins.
t1_dsw7eff	0	*	Should be done though. Shouldnt have been doping. 
t1_dsvx29l	1	*	It's going perfectly well actually, he/she shifted the discussion/heated argument from doping to about what going public means.
t1_dsy0vme	1	*	Doesn't really matter where they train if they cheat they cheat.

t1_dsz39y6	1	*	Although, some would argue that giving NFL players a helmet gave them a _carte blanche_ for using their head to hit other players.  
t1_dsw4ahg	1	*	Both of you would pass the anti-doping tests because that performance was awful.  
t1_dsxqwyz	1	*	Miserable and poor totalitarian police state with no freedom is a shithole. Rocket doesn't change it.
t1_dsdf2j0	1	*	Good one! Couldnt be any more original.

t1_dtn0kek	1	*	You're the one trying to educate people, so how about you provide some sources for your claims? 
t1_dtn9zz3	0	*	>People don't use carfentanyl recreationally.  If the only use for a particular opioid is malicious than we should keep it criminalized.  That's my point.
t1_dtn0pt1	1	*	You're the one leaving out an entire group of people's reality. Not me.  It's fine, though. Clip buds and act like a portion of the population doesn't exist.
t1_dsbtok7	0	*	Fine, here you go  http://www.cnn.com/2018/01/06/politics/president-donald-trump-stable-genius-smart/index.html
t1_dsbkh1m	0	*	Okay but can you tell me what they're putting in the water?
t1_dujgu2m	0	*	No. Were you then, and are you still very satisfied with your choice?
t1_dsgrwva	0	*	>The issue is right now a possibility is deemed the truth without documenting accounts of events.  No it's not. And i meant men in the previous sentence. 
t1_dse19ti	1	*	Oyeah, I'm sure they haven't even begun to create legislation that will weed out many of the would be entrepreneur's. 
t1_dtlks4r	1	*	When I die, if the word thong appears in the first or second sentence of my obituary, Ive screwed up.
t1_dsdrcjr	0	*	So you think the government should be able to prevent a movies release if its critical of a candidate? Interesting position to take
t1_dse0qjn	1	*	Nobody said that at all.
t1_dsdzy21	0	*	Public prisons don't have lobbyists and don't bribe judges to incarcerate more people for the longest sentence possible though. I wouldn't say that's minuscule.
t1_dseevxe	0	*	I have found libertarians have a great confidence in markets and their supposed understanding, but very little actual knowledge of them.
t1_dsdybad	1	*	Clever burn sir
t1_dseexqv	0	*	>Oh for sure, the man sounds like an idiot. That doesn't mean he actually is.  Then why has he been keeping up the act for 3 years?  (Arguably much longer if you count birtherism stuff). 
t1_dsdro31	1	*	I've seen this quote a lot, but this is the first time I've seen any attribution. Thanks!
t1_dsfn6w0	1	*	Nope, backpedaled on his promise just like his dear leader.
t1_dsdqnkh	0	*	You post in Nazi subreddit and r/conspiracy. Your opinion means nothing.
t1_dsdmr4e	1	*	Technically correct, but feels like a pretty meek victory. 
t1_dsenbem	0	*	Your link proved me right thanks for that. He handed over control and moved his assets into a trust that's what he did. 
t1_dsdpqbf	0	*	That's a neat saying, are you going to try to sell me some Herbalife now? 
t1_dsdw94v	0	*	Not being rewarded=punishment?   I can see your point but you have to figure that this logic isn't getting you anywhere.
t1_dsha7ir	0	*	What sin! 
t1_dsecs0z	0	*	PM your address and I'll and you a copy. 
t1_dsds5w8	0	*	I don't but there certainly better ways to make sure that criticism isn't censored while not allowing corporations to spend billions to influence elections very directly.
t1_dsdn90z	0	*	Is that a NOFX reference?
t1_dsdmz6l	1	*	What? He brought up how the right went nuts about Obamas suit and I brought up how the left went nuts over how many diet cokes Trump drinks. I don't understand your point.
t1_dse4wyl	1	*	the rich *in the EU*. Didnt stop the rich who want nationalism.
t1_dsdrudx	0	*	what sort of literal fake news are you pumping through your veins to have this level of delusion...
t1_dse3kc2	1	*	idk that he favors it. But, its not like youre going to make alcohol illegal again. 
t1_dsfrncj	0	*	> Saying it don't make it true. The beauty of reality is that your belief in it has no impact whatsoever.  
t1_dsdozwb	1	*	So sounds like people on both sides can be wrong. As they often are. Hell I was just wrong about something.   But being wrong isn't bad as long as you learn and grow from it. 
t1_dsdztxi	1	*	You, too.     Have a good evening.  Take care.  
t1_dsdn8aq	0	*	You accuse me of whataboutism then accuse me of being a shill because I disagree with you? wow, great deflection due to a lack of argument bud.
t1_dsdmoc0	1	*	They only shared the same namesake, the same building, the same floorspace...
t1_dse3sl0	1	*	If we have enough for everybody to be sustainably satisfied, why shouldn't everybody be satisfied?

t1_dse1o8g	1	*	That sounds like a load of hooey  -Albert Einstein
t1_dsdpc4u	1	*	The rich clearly are not courageous these days.
t1_dsef2kb	1	*	The entire Republican voter base allowed trump to happen  There are a lot of people stupider than trump
t1_dsdxulx	0	*	What percentage of people do you think that is?
t1_dsdmp4i	1	*	Right, but it's been a year. 
t1_dsfzche	0	*	Very interesting perspective!
t1_dsg6kz4	1	*	Ok bud.  Your opinion is worth 80 percent of a average American.  Tuck that in your beaver hat.
t1_dsf566p	0	*	Wow, maybe it's both completely ignorant and easily manipulated. 
t1_dsfwlbm	1	*	As long as you are consistant then I can respect your opinion.  I own a business and I feel like it would be completely unethical to sleep with employees. (not saying I was offered sex)
t1_dsdmjym	1	*	lmao  Reddit, where replying to something someone else brought up is suddenly me still caring about it. 
t1_dsdyxwt	1	*	fuck you, got mine 
t1_dsdo5fz	0	*	Not a bad idea actually, get on it texas
t1_dsdyles	0	*	This would be a rather bad thing that Obama did. However [The Hill](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-hill/) might not be the cream of the crop, and should probably stop being cited one r/worldnews. 
t1_dsdplx2	1	*	Ah, thanks for that!  I still don't think they'd follow through though.
t1_dsdrytv	0	*	No one cares unless your corporation is worth at least 8 figures.
t1_dse1w8j	1	*	That's exactly what they try to claim. Apparently the follies of man are incapable of complicating his utopia when it's applied to real life.
t1_dse8ddd	0	*	You are truly delusional if you think the Dems would get money out of politics if they won. 
t1_dsdq0hf	0	*	Kushner? He was just a staffer who didn't do very much to get me elected. I mean, I won the presidency! Me, Donald J. Trump, super stable genius, folks!  trump latest tweet  
t1_dsdr1vo	1	*	Only matters when it matters. Sometimes the deck is so stacked against you it isn't just hard or near insurmountable, it is indeed impossible. Also failing to dodge a bullet could prove to be fatal. 
t1_dsec2rh	0	*	Let's keep the argument relevant. The government giving juicy contracts to corporations run by people connected to politicians is not an example of the free market at work. 
t1_dsdmzhv	0	*	What? He brought up how the right went nuts about Obamas suit and I brought up how the left went nuts over how many diet cokes Trump drinks. I don't understand your point.
t1_dsgwemh	0	*	I said good day!
t1_dsdnr9z	0	*	Not as directly. However, doesn't absolve them obviously. However, I stand by my point of Iran having no Moral High Ground to stand on. 
t1_dsgzxgm	0	*	If he did receive i, them it certainly influenced him.   Thankfully,  there are laws in place to keep that from being an issue.

t1_dsfmi5r	1	*	Your my grammatical internet hero sir
t1_dsdp6ai	1	*	Unless you have an 11-figure net worth, then all rules go out the window.  Forgot the second part of the quote. 
t1_dsdnbgx	1	*	Hes got his
t1_dsdr32q	1	*	And those 3,800,000,000 combining their assets gives them a better chance. Individually they'd never have a chance. Who can outvote who, btw? 
t1_dse0a1e	0	*	No, but he did other very bad things, and very little to rectify what you mention beyond ending No child left behind.
t1_dsfa4ao	1	*	Well that's true it's still relevant when ti comes down to an election between two people.
t1_dsdwyba	0	*	In a decade, maybe the electoral college will be practical. Until then, its unfair.
t1_dsdo87k	1	*	Thats what i was talking about   That they wouldnt confirm a replacement  That mightve changed. But trump has some strange loyalty to sessions and its weird
t1_dse5jfe	1	*	They wouldn't be. If we got rid of the Electoral College everyone's vote would have exactly equal worth. 
t1_dsdtyuq	0	*	Wicked smaht, you could say.
t1_dsj7qfh	0	*	Use your eyes 
t1_dsdwec2	0	*	You may want to speak with your accountant.  You absolutely can extrapolate a lot of information from complete tax returns.
t1_dse33v9	1	*	Youre right, food aid undermines local economies. Theres a reason its not the preferred form of aid.
t1_dsdnn3z	0	*	because she's still a steaming sack of shit?
t1_dsdy87q	1	*	They should have a voice.  They shouldn't have a voice that's much louder than everyone else.  
t1_dsdopp7	0	*	Again... they don't have many positive things to say about him so they have to remind people that they voted against Clinton as much as the voted for Trump.
t1_dsdwgrq	1	*	Agreed. The best case scenario is Sessions forces congress into removing it from schedule 1.
t1_dse1qx8	0	*	Yes. He also could have given his source to begin with, since he took the time to look up the quotes.   I jovially asked for a source, what the fuck is wrong with you guys? Seriously. 
t1_dse1rcx	1	*	Your vote being worth 1 is not you being penalized my dude.
t1_dsdnfdq	1	*	He's got his.
t1_dsf1mlk	0	*	Yes, that is the level of argument I would expect from a toddler.  
t1_dsdz6li	0	*	Originally meaning when?
t1_dseepiu	1	*	Nothing is **silly** when talking about **pizza** and lizard people. 
t1_dse2vf5	1	*	The answer is obvious.  Pick the one with less body count.  Lessor of two evils.
t1_dudbwa4	0	*	Alcohol has severe effects. And withdrawal can cause death unlike opiate withdrawal. Alcohol is legal because there was a massive political push for it to be so. 
t1_dt2l6rc	0	*	What their stated central tenements and what they actually believe are two different things. They're like scientology, that's the closest comparison. 
t1_dt3shsh	1	*	Chin is 10x as corrupt as the U.S. You literally buy jobs in China. Like if you want to become a cop you pay $30,000.
t1_dt2w7yn	1	*	So, you're basically just saying - in a rather convoluted and crackpot way - that you didn't read and/or understood the comment you initially replied to. Got it!
t1_dt4b5jx	0	*	I didn't say socialism hasnt been tried and I didn't point to norway. I think your arguing against another set of ideas youve falsely attributed to me. 
t1_dt2g7ht	0	*	Killing commies for sure, is that why you hate the US? God think of all the commies we've slaughtered over the years :)
t1_dt2vkbb	0	*	Nope, but good try.
t1_dt3nj9b	0	*	Or alternatively, a country that can practically build infrastructure by decree could, I dunno, build up the infrastructure to handle all those people.
t1_dt3d5bp	0	*	Except for different levels of crime. Leaking secrets of some sort isn't quite the same as disagreement 
t1_dt5rgzr	1	*	Thats what Im thinking , the U.S just put more steps to mask it. Just like the fact that were all debt slaves. And our fiat currency is made up and always decreasing in value. 
t1_dt3sk22	0	*	Oh right, I see. You weren't actually addressing my point about democracy vs authoritarianism, you were just using whataboutism. My bad then.
t1_dt3q4x5	1	*	I doubt there would be civil war.  It'd just be like Russia in the 1990s with less vodka and tanks.
t1_dt5ex0g	0	*	>little chance of happening  Why would they (or you) consider it so, given the fact that there is no precedent of a benevolent authoritarian regime *not* turning malevolent?

t1_dt3s36b	1	*	It is an internal passport system similar to the old soviet system. 
t1_dt36zg5	1	*	Lol, I didn't mean that specifically. But it's basically true. 
t1_dt3v5iu	1	*	Imagine gradual implementation, but a guarantee of eventual democracy
t1_dt3slz0	0	*	Well if you did research youd know there were blunders and misinterpretations of actions at Kent. What China did was a conscious decision to just murder and crush a movement. Try again.
t1_dt3108m	0	*	>Everyone has a critic.  Calm yourself and read. 
t1_dt2zfl5	0	*	10 seconds and a click. It isn't hard bud. Oh they do? They contract people like you or only if they don't know that they are like you? 
t1_dt2xp9w	0	*	Nah well probably invade and enslave once our GDP starts dropping , maybe we'll let our little buddy Britain tag along :)
t1_dt2o7tp	0	*	Interesting. So what do you think the solution is (or do you think there even needs to be one?)?
t1_dt2fzdk	0	*	Hasnt China pretty much taken over your country already? Canada is pathetic we should just take you over before China does or at least split it 50/50 for slave labor 
t1_dt2k2cf	0	*	Never said that.
t1_duq586y	1	*	I don't disagree with the concept I m just saying how impractical it is. no one gives up something for 5 years if you give it up for 5 years u can just likely give it up permanently.
t1_dtdhb57	0	*	Hot damn, Putin is thorough. He has some of his hit men kill themselves so they can assassinate someone again in the afterlife.   ...Fuck, I think I just got a great movie idea.

t1_dtdm17z	0	*	How did his actions with Ukraine affect the rest of the Russian people?
t1_dtd8cd6	1	*	Putins barely a candidate. Hes more like the dictatorial incumbent. 
t1_dtdglst	1	*	MRGA!!
t1_dtdn7xt	1	*	The part where they allow a Russian Islamist stooge into the presidency.
t1_dtdd0j8	0	*	In my opinion, he's too big to just disapper. So the only thing they can do is giving him 15 days in jail, again and agin
t1_dtdfx9f	0	*	Oujij bored?
t1_dtddcbo	0	*	Nope, i'm just a russian. You can ask me a question if you want and i will tell you my opinion on that.
t1_dtdt1cx	0	*	That's normal operation though I would hope if they did well to keep people AND give a bonus. Where is he coming into question here? He had nothing to do with what I'm talking about......
t1_dtebglv	1	*	Right you can't, but it's interesting he only gets 51% with full control.
t1_dtdig4e	0	*	The best part about fucking a horse? You always have a ride home. -Dave Attell
t1_dtdrop8	1	*	True but I laughed quite a bit the first few times 
t1_dtda4mu	0	*	But that would never happen in Jill Stein's America!
t1_dtdlklg	1	*	A referendum only counts if it goes the way you want to some people. 
t1_dtd9x1i	1	*	No, I understand that.   I was just using that as a template for the general attitude, my bad. U0001f600
t1_dtdc5mi	0	*	Eh? I live in the middle of it.
t1_dtw2mqm	0	*	You aren't getting it. People think you are lying because you aren't changing your behavior to match your rhetoric. Lead by example. Practice what you preach.
t1_dsdgy9e	0	*	Lmao. Why is that in insult? Are you bullying me cause I wasnt a citizen? Racist fuck. 
t1_dsayyte	0	*	Okay, so you only travel for business you don't actually live here, that would explain the rose tinted glasses.
t1_dsamhdy	0	*	>  China agreed to censorship for stability  False choice. If the government needs censorship to maintain stability, it means that it is not acting in the interest of the people.   
t1_dsa97xk	0	*	Nice strawman
t1_ds37vrv	0	*	You don't, you've no idea how this works do you?
t1_ds3c1k2	0	*	>that's why you also need to divide by oil   what the fuck 
t1_dtw5a9c	1	*	Nah, he's right, you desperately need to vap a little chronic and take it back 20% or so.
t1_dtu4z7l	0	*	You: How many times have you been ordered to kill the jews? never? See!? the holocaust wasn't real!
t1_dtueo2n	1	*	I dont think Ive ever had such a civil discussion on reddit. Its been a pleasure, friend. 
t1_dtu9pe5	1	*	Our anthem has gone through several iterations. We're not Americans. We don't worship our national relics. 
t1_dtu9ls8	1	*	But the anthem has already been amended multiple times? National symbols change all the time it's hardly a sacrilege considering it didn't even change its meaning.
t1_duf9wjl	0	*	So is Russians running ads illegal?
t1_duf5512	0	*	Don't bother. They are a /r/Donald poster so there is a 50% chance they are just a russian spreading their new message based on the recent revelations. 
t1_duf0omy	1	*	Im assuming thats a part of the long range plan, yeah.
t1_dufeq81	0	*	People like you ignore the largest source of US based terrorism because it makes you uncomfortable to deal with it. They aren't the problem, you are. 
t1_duf6dae	0	*	The articles may be banned but do you really imagine all the shills have also left? 
t1_duf942v	0	*	> if the goal is to promote quality political information...they're all wrong.  Why do you say this? I've seen 100% the opposite.
t1_dufcjgn	0	*	Im talking about protecting the 2018 elections. Not that complicated. Nothing to do with Mueller or the sanctions. The FBI would have a lot easier time if Trump and the GOP actually got on board. 
t1_dufhf0j	0	*	That makes it alright then eh?
t1_dug1ztw	1	*	Why do people go on reddit to whore for karma?
t1_dufyffk	0	*	Is there an example of this happening?
t1_dugc2kb	0	*	Why so salty? Did I insult you in any way?
t1_duflsy9	0	*	Are you new to the internet?
t1_dufk2dr	1	*	You question whether the core demographic is 14-38 yo, or you question that demographic swings left?  The number one post of all time was an Obama AMA for God sakes. 
t1_dufofir	0	*	Nope.  It flipped when the election ended.
t1_duiaziw	1	*	Your bullshit is insurmountable! 
t1_dufoisk	1	*	Civil discourse isn't ruined.  The fact that complete bullshit is downvoted doesn't ruin civil discourse.  We'd have much more civil discourse if we had a lot less bullshit.
t1_duf6fg7	0	*	Nothing can be done about that sub, it's too far gone. Just set it on fire and watch it burn.
t1_dufkfo4	1	*	> This quote was taken out of context >  > Randal Munroe >  > 2018 >  > xkcd-1942  [For The Lazy](https://xkcd.com/1942/)

t1_duf42wh	0	*	I didn't say they did anything illegal. I said it was underhanded. If we are truly concerned about other nations involving themselves in our election process, we should call out all who do. 
t1_duf9i9w	1	*	I thought we were going to have a conversation, but it's obvious you don't want to. Go back your corner and I'll go back to mine.
t1_dugf2lg	1	*	Well it didn't take long for this thread to devolve. 
t1_dugljom	0	*	Previous experiences with government IT
t1_dufml3o	1	*	Because the US system. It went vom pro-Bernie to Anti-Trump.
t1_dstqwqd	0	*	Each episode would involve Odo and Quark solving a crime, but Odo also having to arrest Quark for a separate crime.  
t1_dstkw7o	0	*	I thought Ash Tyler was the bad-ass fighter spy.  I don't think Discovery is as bad as it's made out to be.
t1_dsv1oxo	0	*	I disagree  https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/51/Flag_of_the_Benin_Empire.svg/1200px-Flag_of_the_Benin_Empire.svg.png

t1_dstqzd9	1	*	Why? Who died?
t1_dstri6l	0	*	And North Korea. Let's not by into the Kim's propaganda, all Koreans just want to live in peace.  It's the rulers fucking all that up
t1_dstqo1a	0	*	Garak is the best character in any trek, followed very closely by data. Third would be a virtual tie between Picard (100) and Sisko (99.9), then the doctor from voyager. 
t1_dstqlce	0	*	I cherry picked the actual facts and actual quotes from the South Korean government, I ignore the opinions from New York Times saying theyre PROBABLY just doing it because of this.  
t1_dsttc43	0	*	I think the writers at one point had to turn up Dukat's evil side because he was so charismatic the audience liked him too much.
t1_dsty2yb	0	*	I never understood how the American revolution is backed by the Christian faith since we rebelled due to tax reasons. Didn't Jesus say give to Cesars what is Cesars and Paul told us to pay our taxes?
t1_dstoeaq	0	*	I'm on it. Thanks for the heads up and information my friend. 
t1_dstpq6y	0	*	Yep, them too. Wayyyyy too many dynasties in American politics.
t1_dstuv06	1	*	Its just an expression but you're technically correct. Original comment will be edited accordingly.

t1_dstupbf	0	*	Can't wait 'til you discover Tuvok and Neelix. ^I'm ^kidding ^don't ^hurt ^me.
t1_dstqe1e	0	*	Best Korea only lost every event because we were teamed up with fake Korea
t1_dsypd1t	1	*	This was a meme since EU3 atleast
t1_dstutz7	0	*	Well theyre blatantly biased the other way, no matter which side its on theres nothing but biased opinions anymore. Not sure theres even a chance that we ever will have truly neutral politics 
t1_dstpeku	0	*	You recognize this action will permit humans to continue being marched into death camps.
t1_dsuy36y	0	*	Don't you mean Cyprus ?
t1_dsuiie3	1	*	r/TodayILearned
t1_dstuqje	0	*	Even better, a red circle in the middle of a white background.   Still would be a terrible flag for a country, though...
t1_dstxwp1	0	*	How are Huns and Hessians related?
t1_dstmiws	0	*	I'm not american... It was a joke
t1_dstsrgy	1	*	yes they do, just not recent history.  They both shared a mutual hatred for Japan for example. Surely there's some rich iconography there to be exploited
t1_dstuyth	1	*	Nope, but it would make a ground invasion more costly and could work as a deterrent. 
t1_dstrk0g	0	*	Holy moly those are terrible.
t1_dsu5mcn	0	*	Or you could just try to figure it out yourself and not trust random people on reddit in financial matters? They all have whitepapers, you can look up the teammembers, check the code on github. 
t1_dstw6my	1	*	Amazing use of that video!
t1_dsttlfw	1	*	I'd like to see Kim Jong Un dressed as Super Man high fiving Lex Luthor. That would be a flag.
t1_dstp3jk	0	*	In case you weren't aware, all those ellipses make you sound incredibly condescending, even ignoring the content of your posts
t1_dstphjh	0	*	Doesn't that make it a good flag?
t1_dsunybu	0	*	Fantastic flag for Ireland. I hope to see a united Ireland in my lifetime, a flag like this would be a sight to see official.  
t1_dstoh7q	0	*	Nothing but worthless gold!
t1_dstqaft	0	*	Every South Korean I've ever met speaks impeccable English.
t1_dsu7ifc	1	*	After a 14 hour day sweating like pigs in the People's Pea Pod Patch Protectorate, the comrades and I really need to replenish our precious bodily fluids. That's why we drink Glorious Leaderade.
t1_dstoz59	0	*	Why is it your only Trek series? They're all full of great characters like Garak.
t1_dstzudj	1	*	You resisters are pathetic
t1_dsto6wl	1	*	Here in Korea? Yes.
t1_dstrxzy	1	*	Really makes you wonder just how fucking effective Garek  and the obsidian order really were.
t1_dstv1y7	0	*	Wait but isnt that always the case? I know the DMZ is pretty tense but one country's border is always a 'no go' for another country's army, right? Like armistice or not
t1_dstrcsq	0	*	Papa johns is fucking disgusting.
t1_dsu8740	1	*	Exactly. So dumb. Obama was president for 8 years, so go ahead a pick out your most biased quotes, and let's see if I can differentiate between his and Liddle Rocket Man. 
t1_dstw5l8	0	*	Wait for plasma and sharding. There are no guarantees here but one lead developer stated they can complete thousands of transactions currently
t1_dsu0gep	1	*	If this was a gif you could retire it right now.  Is /r/retiredvideos a thing?
t1_dsup4yk	1	*	You can probably teach little kids what an armistice means with that comment alone. Well deserved gold.
t1_dsu8nay	1	*	Watch the North will pull a Russia and bomb the shit out of the South after the games are over and the US will do nothing. 
t1_dsufret	1	*	DS9 is the only one that Ive had a dream living there. Never dreamt about any other Trek show. Only with DS9 do I imagine myself strongly. 
t1_dstrilu	0	*	He almost literally wound up in hell, though. That's some next-level justice.
t1_dsudzqm	1	*	Garak was supposed to be a minor character, but tale as old as time, the actor killed it so he got a bigger and bigger role
t1_dsu7qz1	0	*	You sound a bit more riled up than me pal. If the countries involved accredit him, the credit is due. Its not difficult to understand. I dont get how unamericans brains work sometimes, Jesus Christ. 
t1_dstpm7e	0	*	Sisko best captain.
t1_dsuc2oa	0	*	It ain't even left, lmao. It's capitalist as shit, making it right-wing.

t1_dstqhhe	1	*	Double the peril double your winnings!!
t1_dsupppo	0	*	What a champ. Though there's a notable absence of a certain color that would ordinarily represent one of the camps. 
t1_dsu9g81	1	*	Lol, I'd hate to be a friend of yours that visits. No doubt you'd show them some shitty restaurants. U0001f602 
t1_dstpo4s	0	*	Pizza snobbery blows me away.  Good on you for the developed palette but for me it's the same at like, 90% of places lol
t1_dsu09rp	1	*	I remember that the Simpsons did something similar. Two chained Dogs barking at eachother, until the chains snap.
t1_dsuhysu	1	*	> They're no longer firing shells over the border at each other  Except when they are
t1_dsubobh	0	*	A stable country doesn't need to worry about whether its flag is terrible or not.
t1_dsumrso	0	*	I think there's been some confusion here
t1_dsv0jf0	1	*	Yeah that's a good point and I agree with your conclusion.
t1_dsup0k4	1	*	That's very sensitive and thoughtful of him.   Kudos to them.
t1_dsw68pl	1	*	You're a fuckin coward
t1_dstws31	0	*	Cyprus does not have much different flag. Just add something in the flag on top or bottom of Korea and it works fine.
t1_dstql5v	0	*	[Clip for those who are confused or just want to see it for the millionth time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7qKcJF4fOPs)
t1_dsudzf6	1	*	Asshole, that video drove my dogs nuts.

t1_dstsnun	1	*	Bahahaha what a reality you live in  Have a great 7 years

t1_dsupylw	0	*	Libya has a new flag.
t1_dsu7cgq	1	*	i bet you can find the glorious leaderade right beside the tentacle grape and leninade
t1_dsu4nrw	0	*	What if every countries flag was just an outline of the territory? 
t1_dstqfs3	1	*	knowing North Korea they would most likely blame the South Korean parts of their team on their news station and saying how they lost them the games or something similar

t1_dsu8tm8	1	*	Damn.. I had no idea.
t1_dstt3rl	0	*	Because they're not looking for evidence. They already believe what they're going to believe.
t1_dsuio4z	0	*	I heard he killed his sensei, and never said why.
t1_dsuniss	1	*	It looks like a RISK card.
t1_dsypfe4	1	*	Lol except commodities are useful to humans and that drives the underlying value. 
t1_dsty5w0	0	*	Right? Primary school geography quizzes would have been so much easier if everyone had a flag like this! 
t1_dsvlqca	1	*	I look forward to seeing what they can do.  The only thing I'm really rooting for this year is some quality hockey. 
t1_dstxcxe	1	*	Pan to Cisco's face knowing he'd be caught 
t1_dsvffr0	1	*	Objectively wrong opinion lol
t1_dsu3d56	1	*	I disagree, as a form of symbolism, there isn't much more powerful for Korea than the idea of unification. Whatever else they may have, it would not be able to make such a powerful a statement.
t1_dstsub3	1	*	*Resistance is not futile?*
t1_dstw1fn	0	*	Meine fresse du bist so ein Unsympath, war klar dass du deutscher bist 
t1_dsturhm	1	*	>a buddy cop show with Odo and Quark I never knew that I needed this before, but I do. 
t1_dsu9i9h	0	*	If Jony Ive designed the flag, it would be the most perfectly beautiful and artistically graceful flag ever created.   
t1_dstq1sr	1	*	Depends on what you think of as the world. East Asia? It definitely is.
t1_dstr28x	0	*	It's obviously a science experiment for my thesis, in 3 months. Labeled it exhibit A. 
t1_dstsyt8	1	*	I *CAN* live with it. 
t1_dstrz1m	1	*	Of course the people do!  Why wouldn't they want to live under eye of the Great Leader?  Too bad the evil South Korean media hides this simple fact!
t1_dstphkc	1	*	Being able to easily replicate a flag is a sign of a good flag. Also, they would use illustrator not Photoshop. 
t1_dsu4at9	0	*	SJWs be like: How dare you compare Korean people to dogs you racist..  Everyone else is like: perfect example of what you are talking about.  
t1_dsu0djx	1	*	Chain of commands      Inner light   The tapestry    Yesterday's enterprise      I wrote all of them somewhere in this thread.
t1_dsuaq57	1	*	That literally fucking describes this conflict from beginning to now
t1_dstr3g7	1	*	:O
t1_dsu5cqa	1	*	No they don't. They want to make easy cash. 9 out of 10 of them I wager don't give a fuck about the technology involved or even understand it outside of skimming maybe the Wikipedia page once.
t1_dsts8me	0	*	Tough talk is nothing now, when two weeks ago it was all 'nuclear winter'.  Make up your mind!
t1_ducf12y	0	*	It may not have been a Glock. Again, without knowing the situation or even what kind of gun it was I can't speculate about how the kid pulled the trigger. 
t1_du1by2m	0	*	Then why did we see a fireball come out the other side of the building, and not mohamed atta and his passport?

t1_du1ozf7	0	*	Yeah compare all you want, my point stands. it is more than a few, it is a few thousand
t1_dsd4ir3	0	*	Except the pope is elected and not some military junta dictator. Good or bad, he is in a unique position. And an interesting one at that.

t1_dsrf2af	0	*	That's what we say when the east deals with hurricanes, so.. yeah, fair.
t1_dsrenzi	1	*	I was staying on the 46th floor in the Jingguang Centre Apartments and some mornings I would wake up and couldn't see the buildings next to me or below me.

t1_dsr5ees	0	*	That's why they are going after the manufacturers of those types of products
t1_dsr5j79	0	*	Can you explain how putting a more efficient engine is a problem? Wouldnt it be easier to pass inspection then? 
t1_dsrlr66	1	*	I'm amused at all these people that have moved here to WNC and talk about the river freezing over and the like. That's the way it was most winters in the seventies.
t1_dsumerm	1	*	I just edited my previous comment. It's mostly an apology.
t1_dsrfkx5	0	*	Am from Michigan. Can confirm. For the last 2 months I've gotten in my car every morning, folded my arms, and chanted fuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuck before driving to work.

t1_dsr7tmg	1	*	Make the bill the MAGA (Make Air Great Again) Bill and I'm sure Trump will sign it before reading a sentence. Far less than now I'm sure

t1_dsn74gw	0	*	Again what country is Baltimore in? Is it the Republic of Baltimore or part of the goode olde USA?
t1_dtv8zef	0	*	How is this law paternalistic?   Don't all communities have sumptuary laws governing what both men and women can wear in public? Are those paternalistic? 
t1_dtuk2x1	0	*	Who gets to decide that? Who gets to make the decision to oppress other people because you feel their fashion choices are oppressing them?
t1_dtuxvpy	1	*	Who says they arent?
t1_dtumykr	0	*	So far none of those actually demonstrate a significantly elevated violence rate in different communities, no. 
t1_dtvf0wx	1	*	 >that's a faulty assumption without any sort of backing or explanation,   Well, to me it's so obvious that it was actually lazy and remiss of you not to notice it. Because it was obvious. 
t1_dtuooh3	0	*	Importing cultures from countries where women are viewed as worth half of a man doesnt affect the country being immigrated to?!  Its funny how lefties in every country make the exact same arguments. 
t1_dtupzeu	1	*	uhm... but im at work...
t1_dtuh24i	0	*	When you have clothing designed to cover the face or head of a woman--obscuring identity--because she's a woman, it's difficult not to see this as the subjugation of all women.
t1_duxiab4	1	*	Why does that matter so much at this point ? You lot are talking about a major social issue and youre asking about how someone will buy drugs when the pharma is closed.
t1_duxgtmn	1	*	hahah IT'S ON!
t1_dux7o74	1	*	I think a system similar to US weed legalisation would be good for less harmful drugs and a system similar to current legal heroin programs would work well for heroin and other harder drugs.
t1_duxcztt	0	*	Due to its availability and social acceptance, not because of it's properties.

t1_ds3yhry	0	*	Try harder
t1_du4h5ai	0	*	Nope, the actual timezone is called UTCxb100:00 or UTC for short. UTC has been in use since 1972 when it superseded GMT as the international civil time standard.

t1_dtme3nt	1	*	So a random British guy yelling at his camera from his basement? 
t1_dtmo9yg	1	*	He goes to a christian church. He was joking about the muslim thing to spite the GOP. Unless you can link a video where he's obviously not joking?

t1_dtn9jnh	0	*	You sound desperate to discredit 
t1_dtmxjdf	1	*	It's a good example of how hard it is to try and sound neutral when unprecedented batshit crazy things are going on. 
t1_duaqnt9	1	*	No. The list he is referring to is not a list of school shootings. Applying any gun crime to a school shooting is wrong. saying weve had 19 school shootings this year is just a straight up lie. 
t1_du9dy6t	0	*	On the cows?
t1_du9fpcz	0	*	What is the charge? Enjoying a lawn? A succulent Californian lawn?
t1_duaojac	1	*	I believe you, i'm just stating that unions don't have to be a pain up the ass everywhere.
t1_du9gwu0	1	*	2/10 is still 2 more than I was expecting!   I appreciate your feedback, and will improve my logic from this :) 
t1_dua22jt	1	*	We stayed at a place there for a week. Lakefront is amazing. :) 
t1_dua7vrd	0	*	I always assumed it's because of how your eyes roll haha
t1_duank6d	1	*	So is I wash my hands in warm water
t1_du9hx0o	0	*	What about renting (or the government just requisitioning) some cruise liners and using the desalination plants on board, pump that back into the grid? Every little may help.
t1_du9cg8q	0	*	You guys have the McElroys tho! :( That's worth something right?
t1_du9g5il	0	*	Gulf coast reporting in. We got 54 inches of rain in a weekend last year, no need not get rid of grass...
t1_du9ljuz	1	*	Yeah not regularly tho.
t1_du9mvga	0	*	I bet so much water can be saved in CA if everyone skipped a shower once or twice a week. Or just took a 2 minute shower for one week.
t1_du9fehq	0	*	yeah i live in texas and uh, its not you know, that fancy. were really nice for the most part but we just like pissing off of porches and in streets and sometimes on cop cars 
t1_du9fzgh	0	*	If Texas was its own country it would have like the 12th largest economy in the world 
t1_du9kv4c	1	*	Because California is so well known for their water supply /s. 
t1_du9ktme	1	*	Yeah but don't have every male in the house piss into the same pee puddle indefinitely. That can't be good on any level. 
t1_du9h5d8	1	*	They don't piss on the same exact spot multiple times per day. 
t1_du9dzuo	1	*	Haha someone from Wales will have to help you with that
t1_du9vno2	0	*	It does. But LA has never run out of water. 
t1_du9q8xj	1	*	It's not a weird thing to have a lawn in California...
t1_du9lou9	1	*	It's the Navy Seal copy-pasta in Afrikaans
t1_du9yun5	0	*	What justice do you seek? Do you think government should take away jobs from white South Africans and give it to black ones?
t1_dua3f7g	1	*	This is based on what? Germany for example up until recently was as segregated as you'd like and people dont seem to have problems visiting.
t1_du9hd6v	0	*	Short of a Weekend at Bernie's scenario, the dead aren't that fun to hang out with though. They're incredibly bad at most things. Like living.
t1_duabdp2	1	*	For one, see Germany.  Second, apartheid and NoKo are incomparable. 
t1_du9e8pp	0	*	People can consider themselves whatever they want. It doesn't make it so. If you live in Africa, you are an African. Full stop. 
t1_du9dzjd	1	*	Or people
t1_du9nab1	0	*	The Wikipedia page for Tyrant will be somewhat alarming.  Historically, tyranny aided a transition from monarchy to democracy.  Where will tyranny take democracy?
t1_du9k8rq	1	*	Yuhh!
t1_ducfrgd	0	*	damn. So many desalination plants. How much electricity will that require?
t1_du9yq6y	1	*	Only half the number per capita and practically no pistols. Also the people who do acquire weapons are screened. 
t1_du9qb5n	0	*	why are you washing your hands after you pee outside? is the zipper on your pants covered in shit or something?
t1_du9mrd5	0	*	If that's what happens, then it can be fixed. But it's not an intentional action by anyone to make certain people suffer. That's pretty hard to do nowadays.
t1_du9fmv7	1	*	Damn. I knew it didnt look right
t1_du9h0ud	1	*	wat kyk jy?
t1_du9dzmc	0	*	Oh of course but if you're in the house you generally use a bathroom.

t1_du9emul	0	*	Key word: Sometimes. I love pissing outside on a brisk morning as much as the next guy, but when it's all you do, its a little weird
t1_dtfwfq6	0	*	Well lets be real here Jimmy, your take on that sentence was not correct either. 
t1_du8fgjj	1	*	Please...stop...with...the...elipses...and...ageist...commentary....and...I...may...take...your...comments...seriously...
t1_dud6wc0	0	*	Ah so you brought it up as a desperate deflection to segway into an attack on democrats. Tune out for a while and regain mental health. 
t1_du8a4eg	1	*	How ironic. It's sad that you're all so unaware. 
t1_du8zs9z	0	*	You say it was a joke, but it fucking worked, didn't it?
t1_du8h1yp	1	*	Uhh, or the DNC fucking chair and several Senator's? 
t1_du8zu0m	0	*	Oh for fuck's sake. Shut the hell up with your conspiracy theory bullshit.
t1_duca3jp	0	*	Not what you originally said. Stop moving goalposts little buddy
t1_du9wmo4	0	*	Uh huh but what does any of it have to do with Russia targeting the elections? Your original comment even.
t1_du8k61y	0	*	>they're a disgusting degredation of people without their permission and shouldn't be given the attention.  Eh, I disagree.
t1_du9wu4p	0	*	Again, trump recorded a robocall for Roy Moore the week of the election. They own that shit and it stinks. 
t1_du7z1ew	1	*	If everyone with critical thinking is arrogant, I guess that explains why you think we're arrogant.
t1_du95rap	1	*	Your comments are cringe sad
t1_du9wlmt	0	*	Then don't grab a girl by her pussy. Witnesses and evidence are still considered in those. Roy Moore was clearly guilty for example.
t1_du8pz7o	0	*	So do you have any actual shame about an unabashed dedicated troll account or are you actually that thick?  I mean you aren't even trying very hard in either case.
t1_du7xoaj	0	*	Yup, it's arrogant and condescending, but what else am I to say. Despite vast differences in every conceivable metric, both sides are the same to you. There's no reasoning with that.
t1_du944ik	0	*	Look in a mirror
t1_du8l42i	0	*	> I said Hillary Clinton was guilty of a crime.  *yawn*
t1_du82b10	0	*	> Lol, did you even try to read through that shitty blog?   Clearly you didn't. 
t1_dspipq6	0	*	> Not if you are using electric buses.  Which city has 100% electric buses? Here in Bergen we have at least 95% diesel buses, and a few gas (not gasoline) buses.
t1_dspfn69	0	*	Yes. How much waste and pollution does producing 20 electric cars weigh out vs producing one bus
t1_dtd9ix9	1	*	Suppose Wyoming got 500 EVs. It still wouldn't be a swing state, yet it would be the only state that really mattered. It isn't just about swing vs solid states. 
t1_dtcxeoh	0	*	That's false. It does not give extra weight to rural areas. Take a look at the states with the most electoral votes. California, Florida, New York, Texas, Pennsylvania..
t1_dtd0m5w	1	*	> Perhaps the DNC should try to appeal to rural voters  They seem to have figured it out a little in Alabama. I look forward to them figuring it out in other states.
t1_dtcsy7r	0	*	Me again.

t1_dtcw2r6	0	*	Everyone on Reddit is me except you.
t1_dtcyn89	0	*	Undocumented

t1_dtcyxai	0	*	Everyone should have a voice, agreed. But everyone should have an equal voice.
t1_dtcvvrn	0	*	The UN has basically no power to actually do anything and that's how every nation likes it.
t1_dtcijq2	0	*	I mean I know you had it banned for a while, I thought maybe that was where your moralism was coming from.  I've got plenty over here, thanks tho!
t1_dtd33qg	0	*	Are you fucking serious you don't know that the US is a democratic republic? That republic means representative democracy?  T_D is leaking morons again.
t1_dtcxh13	0	*	but... that's just math, it definitely favors them.  the strength of a single Wyoming resident's vote for president is much greater than that of an average Californian
t1_dsi8ole	0	*	And thats where we get to the difference between what he wants and realpolitik. Hopefully the Republican  party isnt that far gone! I know we both want him to fail! 
t1_dsiujl0	1	*	If your crime is out of control, the trick isn't enforcement, it's legalize it. 
t1_dsjzoj4	0	*	hey you could easily prove me wrong by just telling everyone what the Russians did in 2016 that directly influenced the American Election.    
t1_dsipg6l	1	*	Yeah, Nut Up democrats!
t1_dsiusyo	1	*	The latter point of my argument suggests that he is both.   To clarify, my reply is addressing the thread as a whole, not your response alone. I was replying to yours to preserve continuity.  
t1_dsjbzrl	0	*	> Added to my list of people to follow up with when Mueller releases his findings :)  Thank you for confirming what I said: You just want to feel vindicated. That's all this is about.
t1_dsvn9on	0	*	Pretty sure things went backwards during the dark ages...
t1_dsvql41	1	*	Yeah obviously but that doesn't detract from the fact technology exploded within the past few decades.

t1_dsvf9gs	0	*	This is perfect
t1_dsvg2lk	1	*	Yes this is pretty much what my AP Physics teacher taught us, that inertia is a non-quantifiable descriptive quality of somethings momentum or mass
t1_dsvsxcs	1	*	Many of this games are literally simulating virtual worlds inside your computer. Much more than just a 2D render!
t1_dsvg2s3	0	*	In communism all business is mandates by government, therefore all the bad shit was the outcome of the system

t1_ds88de2	0	*	So many nuclear scientists in this thread.
t1_ds7uyib	0	*	Surfing the web on a 10 Mbps Comcast connection in the US is the international equivalent of crossing the sea on a raft made of worn truck tires.

t1_ds807qx	1	*	I always found it a bit weird that parts of Canada are further south than parts of California.  When I was a kid that took me a little while to understand.
t1_ds9q91b	1	*	russia has way more nukes then the rest of the countries combined, and none of them have anywhere close to russias delivery systems which are full of the newest anti missile defense tech.  
t1_ds80cfx	1	*	Self-harm is making a come back. Bigly. 
t1_ds7v8p0	0	*	Without nukes, NK would have been completely destroyed by now. So is it wrong for them to protect their country?
t1_ds85jfq	1	*	To be fair, unless you are homeless or have to walk/transit, -31 doesn't even feel that cold since you're only outside for a few minutes at a time.
t1_ds82ia0	0	*	Are you able to think? Probably not. Where was the cycle broken? The US isn't given NK food to settle down like normal, propping up the regime for a few more years. Hence the cycle is broken. 
t1_ds7ygsg	0	*	Once you have no chance of living, it makes you want to make a difference.   Some people won't accept this though, and so do admittedly terrible things to survive.
t1_ds9r5qb	0	*	Well have an upvote and a cuddle :) So damn hard to tell on this site!
t1_dsctp2j	1	*	Not with nukes. With nuclear weapons, NK is not afraid of US or Trump.  Pre-nukes, they were afraid.

t1_ds87ems	0	*	You will find few if any Trump supporters that disagree with immigration.  Illegal immigration is the problem and what desperately needs to be fixed. Source: am Trump supporter

t1_ds88lni	0	*	Or Boat Mormonism being the world religion?
t1_ds88mg9	0	*	Trump has been erasing Barrys pitiful legacy one day at a time and things keep getting better. Is that the trend you mean?

t1_ds8bhhg	0	*	In this context it doesnt make a difference. There is no need for motivation outside of enforcing the law. Attributing it to anything else is just an excuse to derail the argument . 
t1_ds830n1	1	*	That does not however mean that we must have a lax immigration policy. We want the best and brightest.

t1_ds8hvm2	1	*	clams too
t1_ds7w6fh	0	*	You take everything at face value?
t1_ds7xk9i	0	*	I think you took my comment a little too seriously pal. Although I think this perfectly highlights one of those subjects a rivalry could be met that you mentioned ;)
t1_ds8jwpr	0	*	WW3 against only NK? Would be a very one sided war.
t1_ds7uxn2	0	*	Nah i think ill hop the border
t1_ds8lkwb	0	*	Sure it could, but why would anyone waste their defense system to block their tests or institute a cyber attack in a non-combat setting? It would only bolster their ability to counter such efforts.

t1_ds7zv2v	1	*	I meant brew as in tea rather than beer but if you leave it vague you'll attract both crowds. Viva la revolution. 
t1_ds8qaxw	1	*	We talking about Trump or Kim now?  Sucking someone's dick =/ not speaking to them.  Tf? How did you translate that to mean the same?
t1_ds7xeua	1	*	Sorry.
t1_ds89qs7	0	*	iran is very different than all those situations/countries.  and iran have russia and chinese backing.  or are you saying usa can air drop weapons into iran for those protesters?

t1_dsg43tp	1	*	Oh.

t1_dshb512	0	*	The war gave soft power to organizations like ISIS. ISIS recruits by talking to people. That's soft power.
t1_dsgzqa8	1	*	Oh no, it's definitely a big win for the Democrats, for sure. I guess it's just sad to me that a man so thoroughly heinous in almost every way still had that much of the vote, regardless of party.
t1_dsgkezl	1	*	Try to put country over party just once. Be a patriot.
t1_dsh3s9v	0	*	No one, not Simpson, not Steele, not Comey or the FBI has verified it.  Until someone does, its just some guy who wrote down things people told him after he paid them.

t1_dsht212	1	*	Those Ivy leaguers went after the Southern Christian base when they became disenfranchised by the Democrats in the 70s and 80s. This is what they get. 
t1_dsg0z07	1	*	Hopefully not. 
t1_dsgf2wk	0	*	Filed bankruptcy meaning he's lost all his money multiple times?  And if that was true wouldn't he have no money?
t1_dsg1y9g	1	*	Allegedly por-Bernie subs like WayoftheBern and SandersforPresident are moderated by people who ban users that attack Trump and defend Sanders.   
t1_dsg0hd9	0	*	That's true, but I think that very vocal minority is growing
t1_dshtyxs	1	*	Im not equating the two at all. One is enshrined in the bill of rights. The other is the right to kill an unborn baby. I was just asking a question. 
t1_dshhc23	1	*	thanks Pennsylvania? 
t1_dsg2nxb	0	*	you mean the congress and committees that are in cahoots with the president? sure, let's trust them!
t1_dsge1oz	1	*	As have the special elections as well.  The left pretty cohesively hates Trump.
t1_dsfveyp	1	*	Yup, Trumps sure made your guy's jobs pretty tough huh?  Guess Trump should have listened to Yates and Obama but of course he did not because Trump.
t1_dsg4871	1	*	Well if someone used that type of response against an anti Trump weirdo, they'd be screaming whataboutism, so maybe they should just go with that answer.
t1_dsh37m0	1	*	Altered Carbon adds a layer of functional immortality via cloning on top of the rest. Might be worth a read if you haven't yet.

t1_dv0m21o	1	*	Maybe you mixed nationalism and racism? Because they look the same, speak almost the same. Well they have different faith. But nothing about racism

t1_dui8b0n	1	*	Hold on, I'm still working on the details.
t1_dt4xpi4	0	*	Seems like the parents/guardians didnt properly store / restrict access to their firearms. This is something people need to be trained in before they get their firearm license.

t1_dubzhy0	1	*	In the span of the last ~5 years it was definitely how she handled the refugee crisis. 
t1_dubuk6r	1	*	Sadly yes - and I doubt the SPD will move away from their CDU light course.    I wish they'd move further left again to make more social politics. But all parties are creeping to the right. 
t1_ds61rha	0	*	> Also said stone pelters and separatists enjoy popular support of the people there.  So?  
t1_du7wwjb	0	*	Hey remember when you claimed you weren't a conspiracy theorist? 
t1_du4dx8p	1	*	again, you're wrong.
t1_dslbika	0	*	By unfashionable did you mean bigoted and harmful? Because the fashionableness of her viewpoint is not the problem.
t1_dslbjif	0	*	I see no reason to honor people who have publicly and repeatedly revealed themselves to be bigots.   Obviously, you have no such reservations. 
t1_dssu6wa	1	*	I don't think you're in a position to talk about usernames. You just have no substance to offer to a discussion.

t1_dugpsfi	0	*	Yeah and this just makes it cheaper, well not really but it provides cheaper versions.  Why do you hate the poor?
t1_duekljd	0	*	Why do repentant Brexiteers think that they are doing remain voters a favour by realising their mistake, rather than feeling a need to apologise for making such a terrible mistake in the first place?
t1_dueof01	1	*	I don't agree with these other people. I appreciate you saying your opinion here. Angry voices are the loudest voices. To make things better we have to co-operate.

t1_dufnhkb	1	*	Punctuations. Please use them.
t1_dtrbajo	0	*	Your emotions are apparently getting in the way of cold, level-headed reasoning. Einstein wouldn't resort to such emotive arguments, so why do you?
t1_dtqei6i	1	*	Stop. This logic kills the stereotype.
t1_dtr0vm4	1	*	So you're not just deflecting responsibility for the shit the US has done in the past, you're also deflecting responsibility for the present.  Do you think you're helping?
t1_dtqo92x	0	*	NO. The average person in developed countries has a carbon footprint 3x higher than the average person in developing countries. One person in developed countries use WAYYYYY more space and resources.
t1_dtseokb	0	*	Of course I feel differently about vaccines. You can feel differently about different situations, ya know?
t1_dtqkw80	1	*	Once I can buy 6 patties, buns and frozen fries for under $100 I'll quit regular meat
t1_dtqdqhs	0	*	You have an interesting thought process. Please explain why someone would have to be that old in order to have experienced bring your own shopping bags first hand.

t1_dtqkbc0	1	*	My point is if you can't convince them to take voluntary measures, how are you going to convince them to vote for government policies that will introduce NON-voluntay measures?
t1_dtqbtth	1	*	Cuomo of course does, it's the legislature which will likely block it.

t1_dtqn262	0	*	I just checked and about a year ago, they cut it to about $11. I think they're working on how to grow fat with it so that it has a more natural taste and texture.   
t1_dtrkqd1	1	*	Global climate change awareness is already a meme (or group of memes).     A meme is to memetics what a gene is to genetics.
t1_dtqovar	1	*	I wonder to what degree they can look at London to get some cues on how to go forward. 
t1_dtquqvm	0	*	Ahh name calling. No shit hurricanes do dame, but NOAA has stated no change. Sorry  angry, I will take your minuscule warming but not climate change. The Dems are running from this issue.
t1_du05pc4	0	*	I never said they were smarter than pigs, I said they were at roughly the same level. You're the one going off insisting there's a huge difference and trying to back it up with non-credible sources.

t1_dsm4qa8	0	*	Ah yes, we need to persuade people that the earth is older than 6000 years. Sure thing. Not like there is mountain of evidence. Remind me again the proof of Jesus's existence. Where is it?

t1_dslsxox	1	*	Yeah, fair enough. 
t1_dslp3x9	0	*	The US population is roughly 325M and the Spanish speaking population is 37M. More than 10% of the population is a big issue.
t1_dslijci	0	*	and my point is they do for certain areas... DON'T require sure, but to maximize profit u do
t1_dsls7vs	1	*	Government took away everything except my guns. Which is fine. I made a house out of them. And gunpowder is surprisingly nutritious!
t1_dsm3eih	0	*	They let in EU citizens who have papers and a legal entity that can repatriate them if they mess up. That's very different from unvetted mass immigration.
t1_dslgn47	1	*	Well, Slartibartfast did win an award for designing the fjords.
t1_dsp0hhs	1	*	> Theyve lived in both the US and Norway and is comparing them from experience.  Did they have a million dollars to spend on fun things in a single day?

t1_dslglcx	1	*	Don't expect anything else to be open on sundays though.  Sundays are sacred.
t1_duuruu7	0	*	Just as I thought.  Sometimes people bend reality to fit their agenda but thing is,  it just hurts their cause.  I hope they learn how to stop making lies.  
t1_duv5q9z	0	*	I'm sorry but I can't see why incentivizing imprisonment of people would be a good idea, ever. You don't want people in prisons, you want them to be contributing members of society. 
t1_duuu8x4	0	*	> We're securing $ for ourselves by mostly keeping opportunities favorable to us, not creating value.  This is Economics 101
t1_duv81lc	0	*	His personal opinion was against it, but he did not oppose any pro-gay legislation.  When we're talking about politicians, policy and voting record talk.
t1_duvvh01	0	*	Username definitely checks out, what a fantastic substance.
t1_duuvsgp	0	*	Nah, the user is just strawmanning.
t1_duw48rg	1	*	I strongly disagree.  For the elderly patient low dose fentanyl patches are a god send. They don't operate machinery/have a risk from taking it and also don't have the daily pain that comes with age.
t1_duv459t	1	*	Hai, hai, desu~.
t1_duvs3jw	0	*	I like to think they're the concepts of rational, intelligent people, many of who exist in both camps.
t1_duv10cq	0	*	So you're telling me right now, at this very moment his body is addicted to fentanyl 
t1_duuh7z8	0	*	Don't bother, it's a troll account.
t1_duv0x2k	1	*	He is physically addicted?
t1_duugoxn	0	*	You're arguing with a new account. Most likely a troll. Definitely not worth talking to.
t1_duuyui4	0	*	Link pls stating it was arroyos admin being referred to? 
t1_duv1nhs	0	*	Physically he's 71. Mentally and emotionally, probably about 13 or so.

t1_duuq4ol	0	*	If they vote R again yeah
t1_duv2ysw	0	*	Hes wrong. http://www.pharmacy.ca.gov/consumers/faqs.shtml  Right on Californias website they say pharmacists can refuse to fill scripts.
t1_duv18nt	1	*	Sure they can.  Thats not what was asked. You are telling me he is addicted to this drug? As of today, February 26th?
t1_duvcctb	0	*	No, don't you understand? If you use facts that don't disparage the bad guy, you're defending the bad guy. It's okay to lie and invent narratives about someone when we don't like them!
t1_duv5bvr	0	*	So he is currently addicted?
t1_duv30xh	1	*	Just because it can cause an addiction doesn't mean it's right to say he is addicted without proof. 
t1_duv5rp6	1	*	There is something wrong, since it encourages to put more people in prison, which means treating people isn't prioritized.
t1_duursgx	0	*	I'm not arguing with the definition, you doof.  Acting dishonestly in return for money or personal gain *is* bribery.  I *am* arguing with your interpretation of that definition.
t1_dsc3odh	0	*	Its not a tax cut if your taxes dont go down!!! Its just a lie.

t1_ds1doy1	0	*	Cashing != depositing.     No charge for depositing. Charge for cashing.    
t1_ds1axm6	1	*	Homeless people.    People with mental health problems.    Travellers.    Lots of different reasons people could have no fixed address and thus no account.
t1_ds1bxh8	0	*	How did that work? There's a charge for cashing cheques for people with no account normally
t1_ds6007z	0	*	>libertarian  What kind of libertarian idolizes a guy that makes his money off of government subsidies?
t1_ds635z1	0	*	Even if it's a better car? That's fine but call it what it is, fanboyism. I'm an Alfa fanboy but I don't pretend there aren't better, more reliable alternatives out there.
t1_ds65djx	1	*	> only one of those is severely backordered   Because the *other* one is able to keep up with demand.  (xbd /s)

t1_ds659tp	1	*	I don't know if every Chevy dealership is this way now  but the one we buy our cars from has a flat commission to prevent upselling.  Same commission for a Malibu or Corvette. 
t1_ds66cga	1	*	You also have a car that wasnt designed to be an electric car. Batteries take up a lot of space you know. 
t1_ds5xo74	0	*	No i dont give a fuck about musks view of unions. That wasnt why I came here. Im pointing it now because you are being asinine.

t1_ds61olh	0	*	Volvo now or Tesla maybe later?  /remindme 6 yrs
t1_ds6t06h	0	*	totally understandable. To you it seems he's unworthy of such praise. BUT could Toyota or Ford's CEOs actually do the math and be involved in the engineering & design aspect?
t1_ds66dor	1	*	Ford took loans and paid them all back. GM and Chrysler were bailed out. You are the one who is wrong here. 
t1_ds6e7t4	0	*	Cant take a joke. It wasnt my fault.
t1_ds65aae	0	*	Maybe his end game is the energy side of the electric car game. Charging stations and power storage.

t1_ds65ds3	0	*	That's a cute story.  Tell me why Ford spent fuck tons of money lobbying for the bail out bill then?
t1_ds6ofh6	1	*	See the point of the Tesla is that it's cheaper than a satellite, since this is only a test of the Falcon Heavy and they don't want to lose the payload.
t1_ds5yfz9	1	*	My S has auto emergency braking and has since I bought it. Tesla I had the highest safety rating of any vehicle by the NTSB. 
t1_ds63uza	0	*	Anyone who has any contact with Herbalife and other MLM companies will identify with him. It was a crappy financial decision because he underestimated the stupidity and desperation of people. 
t1_ds68gv6	1	*	It won't matter much in next years when currently built Chinese factories will come into play. Panasonic is about to be eclipsed.

t1_ds66mhb	1	*	Ok you are literally on the other side of the planet hmu in 12 hrs
t1_ds6faf1	0	*	Its actually pretty logical. Its costs utilities billions to set up the grid infrastructure and it meant to be a shared cost of modern society. Its the same logic about sewer and water lines as well.

t1_dsylf5x	1	*	Wow. Witch hunt fever.   Are you capable of a conversation? Or is everything you say just a reply calling someone a racist?

t1_dsx2th7	0	*	That was the Nevada US attorney's office, not the FBI.  IIRC.

t1_dt4uvph	1	*	TIL killing a few whales nowhere near threatened, let alone endangered, is turning the world into a depleted poisoned wasteland.
t1_dsj4va6	1	*	He hasn't been charged with anything in the US...yet.  Sessions is allegedly working on it.
t1_dsiq2gs	1	*	He's wanted by the British authorities for skipping bail.
t1_dshjzbx	0	*	And you assume that Swedish judges (magistrate?) are idiots and will look at the evidence which points to a political charge vs the stated charge of theft or cybercrime and just allow it? Get real.
t1_dsi9n3q	1	*	well this is meaningful discussion
t1_dshacqb	1	*	I don't believe so, last time I checked.  Sessions made comments about arresting him, but hadn't apparently actually done anything to get the process started.
t1_dsh5apl	0	*	may  defined as - expressing possibility.  Hmm... Scroll up to where we were discussing could  defined as - used to indicate possibility.  Looks like my statement above still fits.

t1_duknme9	0	*	If that happens then I'll believe it. But until then I'm a skeptic. Just don't think Trump has it in him to coordinate something like this on purpose, much less avoid getting caught for so long.
t1_duk2yfk	0	*	Being pedantic doesn't win arguments, it a sign that you lack the substance to engage.   There is no publicly available evidence those dots have been connected.   Feel better?

t1_dukptx8	1	*	I mean that's legally not correct, but there's no point in arguing as it doesn't matter what you or I say. The courts will go by their standard rather than ours.
t1_dujttl4	1	*	 doubt it
t1_dukcwt2	1	*	No. Thats not how collusion works.   You need to understand the definition of collusion if you want to be taken seriously in this discussion.   Steele was not representing any government entity.

t1_du2935z	1	*	**that's great**
t1_du289ts	0	*	Wet fart is much more descriptive and artistic a phrase than shart, but I wouldn't expect one with the cognitive function to match the image and smell to appreciate that.  *Get rekt kid.*

t1_du1q3hr	1	*	And this is why doublespeak continues to be popular. 
t1_du1jjb7	1	*	Precisely! Looks like he wanted to talk rather than fight. Therefore, there is no feud. Glad we got that sorted out.

t1_du22bhn	0	*	How? That's what everybody is saying happened - he lied and said he wouldn't focus on social issues to get elected.
t1_du26dvo	1	*	I don't know dude that's something you have to figure out on your own. 
t1_du1v98z	1	*	Yes, but they shouldn't and it's one of the reasons they are shit. 
t1_du2ch2j	0	*	No, I think the bottom line just became you equating being harassed for being gay to being harassed for being a sexual deviant that sees nothing wrong with casual sexual assault.

t1_du7bpyd	0	*	Why would 49.1 MB/s be such an impossibility? It would be out of the grasp of the average connection but even high end home connections can easily reach those speeds. 
t1_duagd9o	0	*	Trusting people who have lied and have obvious motive as the sole basis for all of the current right wing conspiracy theories does not seem like a very rational position.

t1_du6zhwh	0	*	Yeah, you're gonna have to back that up with some actual hard evidence.  Let's start with some legal precedence.
t1_du7gayc	0	*	Was that illegal? No.

t1_du6suki	0	*	That still doesn't give  you a right to break the law. If he wanted to make that case though he would be free to do so at the extradition trial but he skipped out on that hence his current position.

t1_dskqzny	0	*	So...still wrong then?
t1_dslzwn8	0	*	You just glossed over the point he made that at least Americans *have the freedom* to criticize their government. I guess you don't know how to counter that one.
t1_dsmlq0q	1	*	Well,I'm pretty sure that's not yours and the person who actually has the power to control that says Tibet is part of China.
t1_dslyq2t	0	*	If my government shut down a website for a ridiculous reason like that the entire population would rage against the blatant misuse of power.
t1_dsl768a	1	*	So if your education does indeed teach you that free Tibet is a CIA program, I would genuinely be interested to see a scan if you have one.

t1_dutabsc	0	*	I'd say Obama had an excellent sense of humor. There's *tons* of videos of the former Pres making fun of himself or saying something witty without missing a beat.
t1_dut63ha	0	*	The more power we give to honest, hardworking, working class fellows like Nigel Farage and Tommy Robinson, the better. 
t1_dut2i3u	1	*	Proof? Link some research
t1_dut45fs	0	*	Thanks for that. It's really impressive that it wasn't broken beforehand. 
t1_dut4knr	1	*	I mean I still vote, but I know it's meaningless
t1_dutao1e	1	*	Except empires and kingdoms have lasted for centuries. Democracies historically haven't been very stable.
t1_dut27qe	0	*	Yes, he's the no-one that pretty much founded modern China.
t1_dut4d5n	0	*	Most people go to other countries to experience every aspect of their culture. I dont think she is a silly girl for her comment. 
t1_dyon7na	0	*	Since when is Chinese not a race? Why did you get pissed off by the 'smallest stuff' I said?
t1_duucfud	1	*	Sadly they wouldn't announce it unless they planned to pass it
t1_dusxqny	1	*	Im willing to bet at least some  percentage of those Chinese complaining on the internet, [are state actors](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/50_Cent_Party) 
t1_duthprs	0	*	The military would turn on any president that orders them to attacks US citizens.
t1_dut6wf5	0	*	Youre going to be so depressed in November. 
t1_dutv8kv	1	*	awwww, stop it you :)
t1_dut586b	1	*	The problem is that that field test is actively dismantling the checks and balances and causing chaos where it can. But nonetheless a way to see the cup as half full, even if it's half full of shit. 
t1_dut404c	1	*	>African Americans make more money in the United States than anywhere else on the planet.    I'm surprised no one jumped you yet on this one
t1_dut5sjs	0	*	sorry I lost you, but could you elaborate on why it's so naive?
t1_dutw0xh	0	*	His son is perfectly competent, and the Singaporean government remains one of the least corrupt in the world. 
t1_duv68uc	0	*	Well, I certainly will :)
t1_dut8p6l	1	*	Sounds like Trump
t1_duszvwp	0	*	It's not just China that does that...
t1_duszxz8	0	*	You don't think he's being insecure by banning a beloved Children's character and series for an entire country because one meme mocks his rotund figure?
t1_dut57sq	1	*	The Byzantine empire lasted only 200 years?  I had thought it was more like 1200.
t1_dut28n1	0	*	No, no, no, you're not alone
t1_dut2k9b	0	*	*immature 
t1_duui7iz	1	*	Shit... Well this is really inconvenient...
t1_dut4lim	0	*	Sure, term limits are not a fireproof way of avoiding tyrants not are they always necesary. But they certainly help.
t1_dusxc9t	0	*	Whoa there, they call each other tiggas. -er is a nonono. You wanna get bounced? Because that's how you get bounced

t1_duuc9ze	0	*	check a the vid on youtube on China's economy addicted to debt. the foundation is defenitely cracking. Yet relative to other big players e.g. Russia & US the economy is not unusually unhealthy.
t1_dut2qhm	1	*	Just gonna leave [this](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_republics) here... 
t1_duvfv7r	0	*	Does that include the descendants of African slaves who grew up as slaves in the US?
t1_dut0ou4	1	*	> I'd be very interested in being proven wrong though.  TBH me too LOL
t1_dutmpxu	1	*	The deleted one above stating germany invaded ussr because a oil embargo. Thx for the confirmation! 
t1_dutbp8c	0	*	In my experience all of the most gun loving people here are a lot more fond of the constitutional system and the idea of liberty than they are any one leader. 
t1_dut1fkq	1	*	Source?
t1_dut78xz	0	*	All of that is silly. You must be talking to the lowest common denominator.
t1_dutjvcw	0	*	Haha Im just kidding I wish all the best to you and Mongolia!
t1_dutd3it	0	*	You didn't point it out. You made up a feeble excuse.
t1_dut46m2	0	*	im not saying there would never be an attempt, im saying the very forces that /u/ausruhen claim would annihilate the public would actually destroy those not leaving power.
t1_dut36l8	0	*	This was intentional. The Republic of China was 'ruling' over mainland China before they retreated on Taiwan at the end of the civil war. The PRC was established officially in 1949.
t1_duy9pby	1	*	I didn't say you did. You just seemed to know more about Canada than me.
t1_dut8nmh	0	*	I love random people on the internet who know more about my thoughts than myself.   Believe whatever you want. See ya!
t1_dut4i1x	1	*	He may be referring to Vietnam. 
t1_dut9fh8	0	*	This is about America, not what other countries did. Stop with the whataboutism.
t1_dutibgt	0	*	What's debt monetization?  Making money from debt..?  And the funny money stuff is because of a fiat currency right?
t1_dut0qkb	0	*	You won't get it. 
t1_dutz183	1	*	To think that a few years ago I would think Trump was good at deadpan... Things change fast
t1_dutxm9v	1	*	Thousands of people find calculus natural and intuitive, and yet millions would say they could never understand those concepts. Your leap to generalization belies your intelligence. 
t1_dusz1pm	1	*	> It could easily just be a typo or english isn't their first language, etc.
t1_dussydu	0	*	yeah I do miss how we used to fuck over Latin Americas political situation. Lets get back to that 
t1_dutxi6j	0	*	You know presidents get elected, right . . .
t1_dut4ru6	1	*	There is only one? 
t1_dut2zk9	1	*	Ok, and what if those systems were to fail? What if someone smarter than Trump but with the same agenda were to be elected? Democracy isnt a safeguard from tyranny.
t1_dut6lkx	0	*	You do know theres a difference between a dictatorship and not having limits on terms, right? Like the US could remove the term limit and we wouldnt suddenly become a dictatorship.
t1_dvn6m0i	0	*	I mean it was obviously a joke, just super tone deaf IMO with everything swirling around his presidency. But I def thought it was hilarious that he said it right after we talked about it lol
t1_dveaseu	1	*	Hope so. It's theoretically more difficult to wage more than a proxy war when everyone has nukes too. 
t1_dutidmq	1	*	No has butter, is cold.
t1_duubz6l	1	*	Start with Tibet and end with Vietnam. No idea where it will stop
t1_dut2ynw	0	*	What about his following through on moving the embassy to Jerusalem?
t1_dut70vq	1	*	Ok that's clever, get your ups
t1_dut51js	0	*	Just because you don't understand something, doesn't mean it's wrong.
t1_dut2zy8	0	*	Literally EVERY DAY I read in the news about something either evil or batshit stupid he has done...how on earth is he not deranged?
t1_dusyv90	0	*	Certainly not, but doesn't change the facts. 
t1_dutapo3	0	*	But, do they have a plethora of piniatas?
t1_duvkpgq	1	*	Are you claiming that the German government is filming conspiracy documentaries?
t1_dutjr14	1	*	THe revolutioj started without him actually, he piggybacked on it though
t1_dv2cqrv	0	*	Fair enough, I don't think most people still think of Ireland as some Father Tedish country these days though.
t1_dskru8a	0	*	What would happen to opinions deemed inferior then?
t1_dskcd9g	0	*	Dickon? Heh heh heh
t1_dskcwzy	0	*	Sarcastic and serious comments are word for word identical. Not even super lenin is out of place. Political sarcasm is just broken :(
t1_dsk7tch	0	*	It's not about winning and losing. It's about meeting in the middle and calling out the extremities of both sides. 
t1_dslf7r3	0	*	Didnt know it was a tweet too. I heard him say it in the debate and he even argued that point while standing next to Ben Carson and Rand Paul who are doctors.
t1_dsl786a	0	*	No need to provide facts when Im calling you an arsehole, you bigoted dickskin.
t1_dskbr3v	0	*	Then maybe give them someone to vote for instead of a horrible candidate with a disgusting political record.  Scapegoating Nader and Stein makes as much sense as scapegoating immigrants and Obama. 
t1_dsk981s	0	*	The issue isn't the black and white, but the gray in between. Who draws the line, and where?
t1_dskhyfk	0	*	Its funny, because they're all the same idiot.
t1_dskkq34	0	*	Yeah. Everyone loves it until it's directed at them...
t1_dskin6k	0	*	Holy shit. Well, I guess as long as he doesn't smoke weed.
t1_dskbhs2	0	*	Then stop hanging out with 9 year old girls.
t1_dsk9ghi	1	*	I had to welch on a bet to eat my socks if Trump won. I'm not putting myself in that position again.   My socks are fucking gross after a day in boots on the job, btw. 
t1_dsk95zl	1	*	*Justifies shitty opinion because of propeganda*  *falls for propoganda*   Sounds about right.
t1_dskjyb4	1	*	It's like the whole country should just go ahead and burn to the ground as long as some 15 year old rape victim doesn't get an abortion. 
t1_dsk80nf	1	*	Contrats on your politeness, I see you have restrained from calling someone a stupid fuck, despite having done nothing for that! /s
t1_dskbcop	0	*	And you just pulled a whataboutism.
t1_dskk62a	0	*	Whos right wing?  Wow, you're certainly an angry little thing still. Did you have your hot drink and relax. It'll do you the world of good! A Happy Liberal is a safe Liberal!
t1_dskfkdz	0	*	Hessen
t1_dskchqc	1	*	Was going to mention that, not in London though
t1_dskfwyn	0	*	>Especially shocking because I (used to) consider some of these people to be relatively rational and level-headed.  That's been a major problem in my family too   
t1_dskakyr	0	*	I guess it's a culture thing. Where I'm from if we had someone pulling the shit he pulls there'd be protests up the wazoo. 
t1_dska7ut	0	*	I attribute it to the great weather here. It's hard to be anything other than nice when you can wear shorts and flip-flops almost all year. :) 
t1_dsk8ri8	1	*	Re read my post. I said one side may very well be worse than the other. Second sentence. 
t1_dsmheab	1	*	Equivocation. Look it up. 
t1_dsl7rwa	0	*	Well that's the point.  *Hillary Clinton* called them deplorables. Why on earth would they listen to that?
t1_dskkp05	1	*	Tangerine Terror.  LOVE IT! I've not heard that one before. Trademark that and earn that money!
t1_dskackz	0	*	Difference is Luthor actually plays 9D chess, while Trump just gets credited for it by his base 
t1_dskh6fz	0	*	Yea too much fucking tweeting from that cell phone
t1_dsk7lag	1	*	I can only hope that's what it is. My dad seems to still be falling for it.
t1_dskip5m	1	*	Oh, give him a break. He should be right, after all. Don't shit all over someone for being a doe-eyed optimist. They're a dying breed.
t1_dsk4e6h	1	*	don't forget butthurt sympathizer who feel that it's wrong to call deplorable deplorable. Fuck those people too.
t1_dsog8cc	1	*	that sounds like it has more to do with your cynicism than the american people's tolerance.
t1_dsldukm	1	*	I was drunk. Oh well. Isnt that what the internet is for?
t1_dskzixr	0	*	Im assuming he price point was reached under Obama admin, correct me if Im wrong
t1_dskachi	0	*	I'd love to. I think it's our mutual governments we need to convince. And probably my girlfriend as well. She's not finished school and I doubt she's be keen on me moving to England without her.
t1_dslcj74	0	*	I mean, supporting Nazis is getting there...
t1_dskotx6	0	*	Right, antifa really needs to be stop. All the destruction caused by them really is a dark stain on America. 
t1_dske1ja	0	*	Several are owned by MPs who need them cleaned regularly...
t1_dsk6hsb	1	*	... both sides are the same. Please leave instead of spreading this trash. 
t1_dsl9dsq	1	*	Yeah? Uhuh. At least the second time in this thread somebody has agreed with me whilst thinking they are disproving the argument they actually do agree with.
t1_dsnahjz	1	*	Ok nice to know.
t1_dsk6p8u	1	*	The narcissists prayer. 
t1_dsu3gk9	0	*	Your position is: I support anything that is good for me. I think that's an unsustainable and naive way to be. You won't change my mind I doubt I'll change yours.  What discussion are you looking for?
t1_dsy7nw8	1	*	I escaped before he took office lol
t1_dskszcs	1	*	 This guy ~~flings~~ spins meat. 
t1_dskait0	0	*	Pulled himself up from his diamond encrusted bootstraps, to somehow flush most of his inherited wealth down the drain.
t1_dskb972	1	*	William - Will- Billiam - Dick. huh?
t1_dskl0p3	1	*	I mean, don't take this as a defense of the dumbass, but I have to assume that comment was made when Princess Diana was still alive, back when the notion of a Trump presidency was just a bad joke. 
t1_dsksfgq	1	*	We've got a lot of morons in the country.
t1_dsk9ivz	1	*	*cringe*
t1_dskbzl0	0	*	*You're  Best get some coffee in you!

t1_dskhgby	1	*	He's implying they were Muslim.
t1_dskbpan	0	*	Well, that's some more than me.  I don't *hate* the new embassy...looks a lot better than the old one.
t1_dsk67hi	1	*	Doublethink means the power of holding two contradictory beliefs in one's mind simultaneously, and accepting both of them. - some guy
t1_dskca1k	0	*	It was actually Richard- Richochet - Rainbow - Rocket - Rekt - Rickard - DEATH - Dick
t1_dske08t	1	*	Hillary can't lose *again* could she?
t1_dsk6elt	0	*	Just replace Jew with serial killer and there you have it. Yeah, that's not a valid analogy.
t1_dskj9hu	1	*	Wowza, managed to not catch that
t1_dskd0sp	1	*	Yeah, I know a family that lived in a 3 bed semi in London, until the Dad was able to work remotely. Moved to just outside Birmingham, and owns a mansion, with a garden large enough to farm crops in.
t1_dskjxk4	0	*	So youre not even gonna attempt to answer my actual question then?  Yeah thats what I thought. Were done here. 
t1_dsk8cju	1	*	remember, it's not crazy until you start losing arguments with yourself.
t1_dskd09d	0	*	If Gore won his hometate, Florida wouldn't have mattered. If Clinton stepped foot in Wisconsin...
t1_dsk5z2a	0	*	That's not what /u/Rubberbabybuggybum said.  >As soon as he does something actually racist...  I'm sorry, what? Ooooh, you're a troll. Got it!
t1_dslcshp	0	*	Nobodies talking about Russians . Go home. You're drunk.
t1_dsk8tkf	0	*	> preserve tradition  I've never heard this term as anything other than an excuse for bigotry. 
t1_dsk6c47	1	*	'twas a pleasure? :|
t1_dslmwf4	1	*	Remember when Dick Chaney was literally waterboarding Iraqi orphans for oil money and his government got a CLEAR mandate in their second term?
t1_dsk62px	1	*	Yeah, if you had any interaction with Trump beyond saying not to contact you again or else you're calling the law, any time since maybe the early 1980s, the consequences are 100% on you.
t1_dska9om	1	*	Yeah
t1_ds3udae	1	*	>Large donors include Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, the Charles G. Koch Foundation  So the Kochs and nuclear labs are now hippies?
t1_ds3ueru	1	*	You sound like Trump, but instead Dr. Trump. 
t1_ds3psg0	0	*	You need a study that tells you putting regulations on a business cost that business money?
t1_ds3uhl6	1	*	Yet you seem to think Berkeley Earth is some leftist organization based on the name.  Im guessing you are in fossil fuels.  
t1_ds3py2y	0	*	So just because you asked me to, I did look at one of them, the most upvoted one. And it literally does not say what the user claims it did. Nice!
t1_ds3pl99	0	*	What's your criticism of the Berkley Earth project?
t1_ds4mb0u	1	*	It is when people don't believe it
t1_ds52asv	0	*	It is my understanding that not all natural causes are balanced. Do you have evidence showing that the only increase in CO2 is due to humans?
t1_ds3u8az	1	*	You're still spouting bullshit. 
t1_ds3z9yz	0	*	We are not going to slow down any such thing.  That is just a pipe dream of climate change types in high power political positions.
t1_ds5a1d7	1	*	Problem in the short term is climate change means what was one habitable will become inhabitable and cause mass migrations of people. 
t1_ds40e70	1	*	Literally 5 minutes on google and you could understand the concept
t1_ds57k5c	1	*	Oh right. That was a writing error.  The numbers were calculated based on 90, 80, 70 though.
t1_ds5w350	0	*	No. I answered your question. Now you answer mine. 
t1_ds4w4cs	0	*	Please stop saying polar vortex. It's stupid.
t1_dtcf537	1	*	You're trying way too hard...
t1_dtck656	1	*	TIL every country is shit at war
t1_dtptme4	1	*	Well, thanks for phrasing it in such a hilarious way.
t1_dtp3jtt	0	*	The free market doesn't create cartels, regulations do. Cartels couldn't exist in a true free market. 
t1_dtq0gii	1	*	Yeah, but Americans don't speak shithole languages from shithole countries.
t1_dtbveiq	0	*	Maybe doing anything in your power to stop them, like the people who helped jewish folk out of the country, those who defected, or not signing up for the wehr in the first place
t1_dtc8n74	1	*	*Brave New World* is what's coming, not 1984.  Shit, we're already there.
t1_dtcbgoc	1	*	I wasn't arguing with anyone lol just stating something. 
t1_dtcedf8	0	*	Hard to fathom that the military is the most productive way to do good things for nothing in return.  Why not green peace? 
t1_dtbyrmd	0	*	Go back to stormfront.
t1_dtbwljg	1	*	Yeah I'm sure that all the people that died in America's imperialist wars give a shit about their 'noble' cause. That cause was driven by self-interest, nothing more.
t1_dtc0o2o	0	*	Yeah, no one would do that.  The fact that you randomly think people in the US would is ignorant
t1_dtchznm	1	*	Me too thanks
t1_dtbuwls	0	*	Those deaths included several suicides in empty schools, correct?
t1_dtbw54w	1	*	I'm not sure what generalization or statement you believe to be inaccurate, useful or not.

t1_dtbxh25	0	*	Can you give me a time period to look at?
t1_dtbw4j4	1	*	Copy cat crimes.  The little disturbed shits want to go out infamous 
t1_dtcuk93	1	*	He is considered a hero by most where I am from. At the very least, he doesn't deserve to be on the same list as Stalin and Mao. Downvotes will not change my opinion on that
t1_dtby2ms	0	*	Thank you for your service.  Hope civilian life is going ok.
t1_dtbvxha	0	*	He was using the personal opinions of a politically-biased class of people to argue a political point.
t1_dtbvuuw	1	*	The werther-effect at least discribes a correlation when it comes to suicides and is pretty well documented.  I don't think it is that much of a stretch to see some similar correlation here.
t1_dtco21e	0	*	500 or 500,000?
t1_dtcgmtb	1	*	I bounced between OEF & OIF between 2003 - 2007. Shit was apparently different then.
t1_dtc2c0h	1	*	I work in the industry and am an MMJ patient. Took a LOT to get me to try cannabis for my medical issues, but doing so was truly transformative. 
t1_dtd0co4	1	*	And you aren't?
t1_dtbu9f3	0	*	That's why it's a (non-scientific) theory. 
t1_dtc4zrx	1	*	(Just clarifying, I said the story is awesome *to hear*- as in the way she tells it is something else, with a lot of context thrown in as to why she did what she did.)

t1_dtbyvzz	0	*	Where do they get money from to successful fight international armies and massive local police? 
t1_dtbuywh	1	*	Gives me a strange sense of relief that if ever it happened, unlikely I know, that I could possibly save the person in front of me as my last act.
t1_dtcaumw	0	*	Point being, if we really were an imperialistic power, Im surprised a large chunk of the world doesnt fly the American flag, even if we overthrew their own government.   
t1_dtcfuc4	1	*	Man, who would have thought attacking a foreign country for their ressources was so difficult.
t1_dtbr9km	0	*	Doesn't make me wrong 
t1_dtcbrva	1	*	Muslims definitely receive unfair bigotry for what one of them did halfway across the world. There is no equivalent hating on Christians for what another Christian does.
t1_dtc45lo	1	*	Yet most of them are. You clearly have not met our special forces. 
t1_dtd7nms	1	*	I'll start working on that as soon as you can get me a time machine :)
t1_dtbzoc0	0	*	what?
t1_dtbzc21	0	*	Show me the CNN source. Newrepublic is extremely baised and misleading so the fact that was your first go to shows you don't have many non biased sources 
t1_dtbwv08	0	*	I mean they are hardly tips but common knowledge for people who use explosives. Someone who is going to take the time to make a bomb is going to find out how to effectively use it.
t1_dtd3f6q	0	*	I just did, and if your country is allied with the US then they were involved. 
t1_dtbzjd3	0	*	Eh I think your beef should be dogma, not religion.  There are plenty of people who are fanatical believers of non-religious things who are shit. 
t1_dtbwih3	1	*	He's saying the Nazis would view children as potential bomb carriers and shoot on sight not that other kids would be caught in the explosions
t1_dtbuoz1	0	*	I doubt you understand my point.  
t1_dtc0iix	1	*	Iraq was a failure when we installed Saddam as dictator back in the late 70's as a response to the oil crisis. 
t1_dtc5er8	1	*	The Republican Party isnt one person with one goal. The Republican Party isnt in charge of when to send troops.
t1_dtc3u3w	0	*	I was talking about communities, not products or media.
t1_dtbyav5	1	*	Then (in both cases) they decided that their principles were worth more than those children's lives. Nobody else did that for them.
t1_dtcz8fc	0	*	Lol can you provide any evidences that Mao just wanted to kill all those people for fun lol? 
t1_dtcnmxm	1	*	Thats not what an edgelord is. Its not even vaguely close. 
t1_dtbxym1	0	*	Dictator doesn't mean democratically elected leader that you don't like. 
t1_dtbuawp	0	*	Yeah, is trump trying to take credit for that yet? Lol
t1_dtbznnc	0	*	So, in other words: 'I don't have any experience or knowledge of the topic at hand but I'll insist that I know better, anyway.'
t1_dtc1hkr	0	*	Afghanistan is not a warzone. This is a terrorist attack. Is France a warzone too when a terrorist attack occurs?
t1_dtc1ahi	1	*	Noble causes are only noble from the nobleman's perspective.

t1_dtbx2ty	0	*	School shootings. Not with large amounts of deaths, but still school shootings. 
t1_dtc3xpi	0	*	Really? I get that public schooling has a million problems, but I don't see how you can deny that math, literacy etc have an immense impact on the performance of our brains
t1_dtbxobq	0	*	You just changed a word he said to something else, yeh he's not the one who missed the point
t1_dumxfmg	0	*	how was that cup of nazi water? did you have a nazi shower too?  thanks for the amusing chat, enjoy your day.
t1_duevdve	1	*	quite the cheeky move considering he's currently playing for the toffees
t1_duexxby	0	*	Seattle had one of the worst suicide rates in the world, not sure if it still does. But weather was one explanation.

t1_dtma73k	1	*	Hmm I'm American so I'd have to find a specialty bakery   I've got a polish bakery I get perogi's from. They've got wonderful bread. I'll have to find an Italian bakery. 
t1_dtm4097	0	*	Yeah because it's not like their is a money or language barrier in the way. Stop being foolish. 
t1_dtm3wxi	1	*	Yea same 
t1_dtm4n7h	1	*	It's not that hard to learn Spanish. I'm sure you can do it. Language will stop you from living on your utopia? That doesn't stop cubans from trying to flee to the US.
t1_dtm2f0o	0	*	Well youre doing a shitty job as I assume the device youre using to make this comment is basically the direct result of capitalism. You must be young. 
t1_dtm49h5	1	*	Communism is not an alternative to capitalism.
t1_dtmj2yn	0	*	**SPOILERS**  Except Jon Snow is legitimate and the true heir to the throne.
t1_dtm304p	0	*	The worse in people gets a lot worse with an authoritarian government. And socialism simply must be authoritarian. Capitalism can be democratic.
t1_dtm9s0q	0	*	1400 to 2400 calories per day is not 'starvation', unless you're an American who can't imagine not having at least 3 servings of burger per day. You're just wrong, stop posting.
t1_dtmnhxq	0	*	Ok. It could have been Castro who sneaked out of Cuba and just left his brother in place of him for a few days..
t1_dtoy1il	0	*	The had no food and the citizens were poor. When Boris Yeltsin of the communist party visited American grocery stores he was amazed that much food was available. 
t1_dtzcstt	1	*	Oh no it has, people still just love to say nobody uses it for whatever reason.  I have multiple groups that use WhatsApp and slack and basically nothing else to talk, its use definitely exists here
t1_dtz22hy	1	*	No one I know uses it in Quebec either.
t1_dtz698k	0	*	You said the world revolves around the earth. 
t1_dtz2y51	0	*	Well it's blocked in China so its not exactly ubiquitous pretty much everywhere except the US. 
t1_dtz3msv	1	*	I loved it. It was much better than Cats. I will watch it again and again. Lovitz's cudgel.
t1_dtyzq6z	0	*	Yeah, I never said it did. I was just saying what younger people mostly use nowadays.
t1_dtz2t5g	1	*	Could be. I have seen far too many respectable journalists that seem to have fallen for it, though.
t1_dtz24dr	0	*	Yeah, but it made it easier for people like me who grow accounts.  Now I can sell powerlikes, or use them to grow new accounts. 
t1_dtzbquz	0	*	According to every intelligence agency in this country and several in our allied countries. But it's ok, just keep living under a rock and dreaming about sucking on Trump's balls.
t1_dtz16yy	1	*	So no source then? OK.   I just wanted to clarify because your position was so weird and unsupported I figured I must be missing something. 
t1_dtz8ck3	1	*	You don't, unless something has changed since yesterday. You can sign up with email or phone number too. 
t1_dtzme16	0	*	Why? Do 16.7% (1/6) of donut holes fail QA checks?
t1_dtz6nk5	0	*	Seriously? You think thats impossible??
t1_du2qpih	0	*	I love my country too, so much so I even served it. But If you're going to hate one religion, hate them all. They're all guilty of being murderous death cults. 
t1_dtyyjoj	1	*	I wouldn't really consider Trudeau a huge hero of mine.  I just understand when someone has made a joke.
t1_dtzz2m4	1	*	Considering how stupid the average comment is in this thread, yes. 
t1_dtzf2pb	1	*	The real world.
t1_dtzskuf	0	*	What are you talking about? We're talking about a video that obviously exists. I'm telling you to go watch it.
t1_du2jn7d	1	*	He didn't know at the time that it was fake, and his statements seem entirely appropriate under the circumstances.  I think you're just desperately grasping for some excuse to hate him and his cause.
t1_dtzea45	0	*	Again, because most people on Reddit are liberal and just want to upvote stuff that supports their view.  Conservatives are no different. You are just outnumbered
t1_dtz09l6	0	*	which ones?
t1_dtzdsvk	1	*	Hyperbole is king.  Honestly I don't know if that quite fits, we should come up with a new term like Holy-fucking-ridiculousness-my-eyes-won't-stop-rolling...ole.
t1_dtzpfcr	0	*	My bad! Still getting the hang of actually commenting on Reddit... meant to reply to the guy before you lol
t1_dtz3mkw	0	*	Didn't Great Britain have to cancel like 50k surgeries in the month of January, since they didn't have the funds and manpower to operate at the level at which people needed medical operations done?
t1_dtz6syx	1	*	The guy said this in this very thread:  >Reddit has a huge hard-on for Justin Dreamy Eyes Trudeau and his cool socks.  and then went on to make 1000 comments about him, lulz
t1_dtzmtnt	0	*	Good thing my life doesn't revolve around my interactions with this site and its users. Otherwise I would agree with you.

t1_du044hu	1	*	I ve always found part of them rather thought police authoritarian, for whom anyone with different opinions is an xfcntermensch, a creature of lower moral value.
t1_du0ddif	1	*	It's personkind bro. Obviously a joke. 
t1_dtzhxxs	0	*	I think there sure are those instances. As long as you don't automatically disregard anyone using the term, I don't see anything wrong with your approach. Cheers for the polite convo.
t1_dtztgx4	0	*	I dont think that following up on every clip you see throughout the day is based on logic and intelligence. I think its more inquisitiveness, and putting aside a lot of time to read up on things. 
t1_dtz5sy6	0	*	He's crass and abrasive. No doubt. But some people enjoy that. 
t1_dtzdj21	0	*	They dont have a problem with those Americans, just the ones who hurt people or arent American citizens to begin with. 
t1_dtz8vdc	0	*	have to fight fire with fire.
t1_dtz33xy	1	*	It means he has thrown some stuff into the mix he is willing to walk back from in order to get a deal. Go to bed. You don't understand trade negotiations.
t1_dtz487l	1	*	In America. Global is still up.
t1_dtzdruv	0	*	It doesn't matter if they're better off if it results in an even bigger gap between rich and poor!!1!!!1!
t1_dtziyfe	1	*	That's an old list, doesn't list any of his recent stuff. You have to attack their sources that has formed their flawed perspective.
t1_dtzi4aj	1	*	 #conservativedelusion

t1_dtz6xt0	0	*	It's not like they have to switch or anything, it's just another app. If they can't even bother to install another app to keep in touch with you.. yeah.. it can't be that important in the first place.

t1_durj2ph	1	*	Honestly I wouldn't be surprised if that the only reason we are doing so well right now is that he's doing our memes 4 us.

t1_duqgfdx	0	*	Don't know any presidents named Dyson.
t1_durbx2n	1	*	Arrested yes, indicted no. Regardless, people who cut deals get better sentencing than those who don't talk. That isn't to say that drug sentencing isn't also out of whack.
t1_duqvu76	1	*	I appreciate you letting me know you enjoyed it, youre the first one! Saves on space and forces you to be a little creative with your words :P
t1_duqllf0	1	*	Thanks now put down your phone delete your reddit account and go try to be a good person.
t1_duqihqb	0	*	Thats what theyre supposed to do.

t1_duqgsyt	0	*	They're supposed to...
t1_duqoxzn	1	*	Dam...
t1_durgn76	1	*	There's been news that Mueller has been talking with the New York attorney general. There could be others, depending on jurisdictional issues.
t1_duqlfpz	1	*	Easy on the pills bro. Your delusion is already quite severe.
t1_duqlwq8	0	*	Just now.
t1_dusb1o8	1	*	Not yet

t1_duqtdgn	1	*	Come to think of it, he was pretty pally with Gorbachev for a guy who hates commies.
t1_duqsqwa	1	*	Okay. We can disagree.  Take care.
t1_dur0gho	1	*	Lordy
t1_duqm55b	1	*	People were a lot less optimistic back then. You notice, nobody called World War II the Last World War.
t1_duqtf6q	1	*	The subtitle for the Nixon movie should have been whitest dude in history.
t1_duqknon	1	*	Isnt that the point???

t1_dur3obc	1	*	Fuck Chris Christie, Im glad hes gone.
t1_duswb1s	0	*	I guess that's the part I wasn't taking into consideration. That you can be held indefinitely vs getting out eventually for time served on your state crimes. Thanks.
t1_durysln	1	*	Dam... harsh
t1_duqsc59	0	*	If you're talking active anger, sure. The fact that we don't learn from our mistakes leads us to people like Trump. I'm seeing way too many positive things about Bush these days.
t1_dsohgwj	1	*	Yeah I'm sure the biggest army in the ME, the one with nuclear submarines and F35s is just failing miserably at their attempts. Lol.
t1_dso9n1y	1	*	Which rights dont they have?
t1_dsorvpa	1	*	You also can avoid the army in general and do civil service.  Mandatory conscription somehow justifies blaming everyone? Soldiers don't make the decisions.  The nerve of some redditors..
t1_dsosp1d	0	*	So you're saying someone could serve in the German army in WWII and not be a Nazi? They were just following orders?
t1_dso9ul8	0	*	oh yeah, if you want. start with bangkok
t1_dsoath7	0	*	Palestinians generally arent citizens.  You need a permit to go to Israel if you are from any other country  What rights dont Arab citizens have though?
t1_dspbhc6	1	*	Using it on people is illegal, yet using it on ground isn't. It just strikes me that it's a bit easy to make a mistake. I was in the army, and I always feared being a burns casualty. 
t1_dsoofbe	0	*	Imagine how much support you could get if you had actual arguments and not bullshit appeals to emotion backed up by nothing.
t1_dtj4elj	0	*	They walk around telling people to dress more modestly, not to drink etc etc
t1_dtiynii	0	*	I didnt say whether it was different, I said you dont have to provide it, you make a log in. Which is *correct*. 
t1_dtj7wl7	1	*	xvideos is a porn site and it's also subject to the law
t1_dsyrhuh	1	*	I see upvotes make you feel special

t1_dsxarsz	0	*	Both, you have Libya and Vietnam for the French, as for the UK they have slowed down since their imperial days, but were very active in the 50s, now they mostly back what the US does
t1_dtsulos	0	*	You can actually see the Apollo landing site with a telescope. So, unless they sent that stuff up there just for pretend, it's real. 
t1_dttcc69	1	*	Did you read it?
t1_duu9rle	0	*	Thats because the US is a strong ally to Kuwait, good job, now you have the whole world treating palestinians like shit or else they get in trouble with the US. You should be really proud of yourself 
t1_dtskohi	0	*	Because they...serve chips in takeaways?
t1_dtow10v	1	*	Nice thought-projecting, feminist sympathizer. Actually I live in the country where MSM calls our people fascist but Hitler mudered my distant relatives. We are tired of your deep state corruption
t1_dtogxoc	1	*	Don't we have enough school shootings?
t1_dtol7ho	0	*	>Why not ask me about how I feel about firearm ownership?  I don't care how you feel about firearm ownership.   Bye.
t1_dtoet3s	0	*	He's probably an 'all lives matter' bro.
t1_dtp6cq2	1	*	At the moment that is very out of vogue in Europe because some of them could be refugees rather than economic immigrants. Doesn't mean they shouldn't be repatriated but it is what it is.
t1_dtohie9	1	*	Both sides can go fuck themselves.  Cheers!
t1_dtolcso	0	*	Thanks, Mr. Samalam.
t1_dtondx4	0	*	Wow that stale trope?

t1_dtoiypi	1	*	Just give it up
t1_dtoiauv	0	*	> But you don't explain anything.  And that's where your reading comprehension failed you.
t1_dtohpu8	0	*	The Confederate constitution actually forbade any state from banning slavery, so the states had even fewer rights under the Confederacy!
t1_dtohscm	0	*	What other reasons did the south have to secede apart from slavery?
t1_dtp1ahm	1	*	Personally, on the rare occasion I do a mathematical proof (and actually do it by hand instead of in Mathematica), I still usually end it with QED. It would feel unfinished ending it any other way.
t1_dtp4z88	0	*	That's.. interesting. So are they comically racist because they think that's how Americans act or is it unrelated?
t1_dtotf7e	1	*	That was the French flag though
t1_dtoj87e	1	*	Do you seriously think that the civil war was fought for anything other than the topic of slavery?
t1_dtosbyq	0	*	Haha that's exactly what I was playing at. Moin moin and you're the talkative type.
t1_dtojwjx	0	*	Do you travel to Germany often? If so, what's your favorite city/town? Or least favorite?
t1_dtolz64	0	*	Millennials are out of or coming out of college these days, not high school.
t1_dtoio7d	1	*	Exactly, so I try to focus on the slaver half of slaver insurrection.
t1_dtonimt	0	*	Can you only express a nice sentiment by being a cunt to the rest of the world?
t1_dtom2p6	0	*	Or making a good joke must be hard for you

t1_dtoqvs9	1	*	...but the square just means Q.E.D. it's the same thing. Just as a symbol.
t1_dtot0ln	0	*	Not nearly as much since the US stopped backing right wing death squads and dictators. 
t1_dtonufn	1	*	 I mean, only a few of them are really relevant, and none of them are as big as Lazio and Verona.
t1_dtp66ly	1	*	Forcing whatever. My point is that doing fucked up shit to your own citizens is worse than killing enemy soldiers. 
t1_dtof1lk	0	*	I think that you'd find that a substantial number of people flying it would disagree with you, but as I said, that's irrelevant to the fact that it should be fine to fly it.
t1_dtoulnd	1	*	Terrible but six serbians thugs (probably drunk, I know the human typology) are not a great sample of a whole country situation.    
t1_dtp3c09	1	*	For how innocent you are, it's weird how cagey you get about saying that you only want white people in your country.
t1_dtoh16y	0	*	No one said anything like that.   
t1_dtop3a8	0	*	The real problem is immigration btw.
t1_dtp9677	1	*	There were no Sub-Saharan-looking folks in your picture. 
t1_dtoqans	0	*	>That doesn't mean the facts themselves are the social construct, merely the peoples belief in them.  That's what I'm saying. Races are not social constructs, but people's belief in them is.
t1_dtotw7d	0	*	> I don't know why he did it.  Then how do you know that he knows what he was doing? 
t1_dtp72vr	1	*	We're talking particularly about Canadians here. You think they're proud of the American South? There's not much of a heritage argument there.
t1_dtoyo2s	0	*	I think all harsh insults are terrible, just trying to rationalize why people with different skin color experiences racism when traveling about.
t1_dtoraqs	0	*	Are you saying that Italy and the US share almost the exact same history?
t1_dtomyja	1	*	I learned this in a discrete math class and for weeks we all would say/yell QED when we needed to prove a point.  Good times.
t1_dtoo30h	0	*	Are flu shots free? Here we can get them without even going to the doctor... It's a great investment because it stops a whole bunch of people missing work and being unproductive.
t1_dtp4v2p	0	*	Its actually happening way more often than it used to
t1_dtok5c2	0	*	Again with the both sides crap, I'm not American and don't consider myself right or left but it's clear one side is WAY worse. 
t1_dtovp0m	0	*	You are saying italians should not be racist because they aren't really white.  Well, I don't care if you think italians are racist or not but they definitely are white so your reasoning is wrong.
t1_dtp074r	0	*	We were talking about black men being killed due to racism in Europe 
t1_dtp0sat	1	*	Some of the Germans were POWs, but they were in the minority. 
t1_dtpl1k6	0	*	No, but that's because my city has strategic value. Sounds like your city might be some podunk middle of nowhere city. Where is it exactly?
t1_dtpihma	0	*	It was a rebellion *against* freedom. They fought to explicitly maintain slavery as an institution.  Not to mention is crippled the US for decades and killed hundreds of thousand of people. 
t1_dton51a	0	*	Yeah, failing material conditions have never caused anyone to, say, _seize the means of production_ and kill a bunch of people.
t1_dtoxa2d	1	*	It would also be weird being prideful of a sports team that hasn't existed for the past 150 years, and didn't even win anything back when they existed.
t1_dtox1oj	1	*	I think the reason is that they want the jews to build their ethnostate so that they will leave the rest of the world alone.
t1_dtpu5mm	1	*	Don't forget this thread concerns Italy, which has had a moribund economy for quite a while. So shitty material conditions makes sense in that context.
t1_dtomeza	0	*	God. Italian food is such insanity because of how much things can change within a few miles. 
t1_dtqbqa0	1	*	Me good speller yay.    Meant hand me downs was kind of half asleep when I wrote that.
t1_dtp4fmy	0	*	I mean how does bone structure relate to subraces or ethnicity and social constructs? I'm not understanding your connection. 
t1_dtof3yy	1	*	You are dense as fuck. Seriously, that African American studies degree is not paying off for you.
t1_dtowj62	1	*	Marx was pretty clear on what he thought was the cure to capitalism. You should read the manifesto.
t1_dtowtv4	0	*	Nope I am see simply for self defense. If the government doesn't do it the people will. 
t1_dtom8s1	0	*	The South really had no foreign being willing to back it and then have to deal with a growing industrial power many times larger than them having a hate boner for them
t1_dtpurw3	0	*	That's wildly misleading.
t1_dtpzuzq	1	*	what?
t1_dtomszx	0	*	Ah yes, the meltdown. The antidote to right wing goons is just ask them to explain themselves. Then the excuses start. I'm not a racist goon I SWEAR!
t1_dtpcm8h	0	*	But it's not. That's like saying Helter Skelter is connected to the Manson murders. It's just an excuse lunatics use to justify their actions. So why mention it to help justify him?
t1_dtoqnie	0	*	Foreign powers didn't want to directly support the South political position. 
t1_dtousjr	1	*	Yeah but its not just a sports game. It was people killing to protect their right to hold slaves. Sports players arent doing anything wrong. Confederate soldiers were
t1_dtokqlj	1	*	Replied to the wrong comment, apologies.
t1_dtpbhc5	0	*	Italy is a little bigger and more diverse than the 5 mile radius around the Sistine chapel.  Also apparently white countries are the only ones worth visiting to you.
t1_dtom1h0	1	*	Rollsafe.jpg
t1_dtoq6d3	1	*	Nope
t1_dtol6n8	0	*	I didn't mean extremist in a centrist's purely bad connotation.
t1_dtoucmp	0	*	Welcome to 2018, where a guy randomly shooting exclusively black people is totally not racist.
t1_dtonggg	0	*	I don't remember much of my secondary school history on Italian fascism but wasn't the Nazi party only socialist in name?  First they came for the Socialists
t1_dtomrge	1	*	difference between patriotism and nationalism, 1 is being proud of your country and wanting it to be doing well and great, the other is thinking your country is the best and all the others suck
t1_dtoum2b	0	*	That flag had already been around for a hundred years before The Dukes of Hazzard even aired. 
t1_dtoieq3	0	*	Why does the pointing out of one logical fallacy entail that it doesn't exist anywhere else but here? What an odd conclusion to come to.
t1_dtogtvp	1	*	LOL. Logic doesn't run deep when you use a perceived moral high ground as your sole argument. Metecury schooled you, lad.
t1_dtomo9v	1	*	I think Andersonville had a history channel movie or miniseries or something, if you want to get an idea of how bad it was.
t1_dtp18y4	1	*	You too.
t1_dtpv4ba	1	*	No mate, racism is racism. Doesn't matter the colour of the person expressing it.
t1_dtokcp7	0	*	You do you man, I don't really wanna explore these topics right now
t1_dtot1h1	0	*	Hey ms shai go rub some coco butter on your elbows and whine to someone who cares. 
t1_due0med	0	*	I literally say in the very next sentence about that guy. That is the only murder the alt right has committed. If you read more than the first sentence you would have noticed that. 
t1_dtos5ip	1	*	I know someone who legitimately told me that millions of people would die in the revolution that he wanted.  They would die only because they possessed more things than others.
t1_dtq90vl	1	*	>Death? Who was ever talking about Mussolini's death?  Is it a bird? Is it a plane? No, its the original point flying way above your head into the distant horizon.
t1_dtooz85	1	*	Sounds like Hannibal in the Italian peninsula.   He won many battles and terrorized the countryside.   But in the end, he was just never going to take Rome. 
t1_dtoeuaq	1	*	heh, I'd definitely get fired for unrelated reasons.
t1_dtoo92q	1	*	ok nazi

t1_dub3plf	0	*	You don't know how an ultrasound works do you? 
t1_duccqgl	0	*	Why does it matter? Why do you care so much about what someone identifies as? Stop pushing your nutty beliefs on other people and mind your own business. 
t1_dt6bwtr	1	*	Well, I mean... every quarter of a year is 3 months because that's what a quarter is: 12 divided by 4 = 3.
t1_dt6tr9g	1	*	There's only the 1 in Perth. We have no competition 
t1_dt4mcsu	0	*	You said,   > If you have passion then there is virtually zero need for a teacher, **in any field really.**  And I agree that's a dumb statement to make.
t1_dtdc8gu	0	*	They were a socialist party. Guess what they didnt become a dictatorship.  So, I guess you were wrong. 
t1_dtcejpt	1	*	People would call him that anyway because of how relatively extreme his promises are. I've seen some comments go as far as calling him a commie.
t1_dtdq2ne	0	*	No, my source is official unemployment and wage information released internationally. The downturn now is worse than previous ones, by a wide margin, but Venezuela wasn't fine in the 90s.
t1_dt3tfyy	0	*	> Now look at Russia, where this is something that happened rather often  Often? You won't have any problem to bring a hundred examples then. 50? 20? 10 at least?
t1_dtxcoge	0	*	That is true. But the fact remains that both Koreas and China want a unified Korea.
t1_dtuyxn7	0	*	Really?! Are you seriously ignoring the fact that Russia was involved. 
t1_dtuz05x	1	*	Where did you get your law degree? Undergrad? Have you passed high school yet?

t1_dtu3eoe	0	*	are you a trump supporter?
t1_dtui599	0	*	It's their justice system dude, wtf, you think every country on the planet follows the same set of rules? It's almost like different countries do shit differently, crazy i know.
t1_dtuz3dz	1	*	Well the US actually has a strong case of conspiracy to violate the espoinage act since Chelsea Manning pretty much testified against him in her court martial guilty plea.
t1_dtvbmi4	1	*	How?
t1_dumzkg6	1	*	interesting, i never said otherwise
t1_dsd3e2n	0	*	Okay but here is the thing. Why would any occupied people side with their captor.   Are the French Resistance Terrorists for opposing the occupation of their country? 
t1_dsdgx5s	0	*	These are multiple stories.   Okay a more apt question.   Why don't you write down the acceptable ways Palestinians are allowed to fight against occupation. 
t1_dssm4sj	0	*	I don't think I could imagine. 
t1_dshdr6x	1	*	I see what you mean now, but it look comically bad before the edit. At the end of the day, I'm just glad I don't live there.

t1_dv300mm	1	*	But are you happy to be alive? 
t1_dv41062	1	*	This is why California has some of the strictest gun laws in the country. The Black Panthers marched on the state capital open carrying weapons, and Ronald Reagan was like nope, never again.
t1_dv328qb	0	*	I was in the vicinity of Bataclan because I was living on Earth at the time.

t1_dv2idsh	0	*	Which is why we have some certain gun laws already. The politicians got scared and started making it harder for minorities to get firearms legally. Gun controls roots come from racism and fear.
t1_dv2ghi3	1	*	And my axe! Let's go face axe.

t1_dujpka8	0	*	This is exactly not it. If your solution to Trump is to call him names rather than provide any substantive alternative your going to keep losing.
t1_duk7v2v	0	*	There has been some meme that circulated for a while in the past two years.  What evidence do you have that they always argue the liberal viewpoint?
t1_dujreix	0	*	You don't think there's perhaps some categorical difference between reporting the actions, statements, and intentions of others to the press and cutting peoples' heads off?

t1_dujjqld	0	*	> So where in that are illegal immigrants mentioned?
t1_dujzcmb	1	*	You'd be surprised at how many people literally think being rich just means you are better and smarter then other people overall.  It's the Mercer mindset.

t1_dukb58h	0	*	Insult? Yes. Assault? No.  See the difference?
t1_duk79k0	0	*	We are talking about two different things. Again, the original comment was about red states being statistically less intelligent. Everything else you rambled on about was unrelated and made up by you.
t1_dujuhb7	0	*	I don't know what you're talking about.  Obviously America should run itself.

t1_dtjlvez	1	*	I appreciate you writing this out. Thank you.
t1_dtk2ebw	0	*	That's not why they do it, usually it's because women prefer circumcised and the doctor recommends it
t1_dtkkg4j	0	*	I have no idea why this triggers you so much.   There is no reason to get your kid circumcised. 
t1_dtirq7k	1	*	I am a Certified Male Penis Inspector, after all.
t1_dto6481	1	*	The difference is that if there is medical need then it was in a worse condition than if it were circumcised so, bad as it is, it is the best that current medical science can manage. 
t1_dtjkqv3	0	*	Only losers sheepishly accept and get over damage that has be done to them, you need to fight and stop being such a wimp in life....or not, your choice. 
t1_dtjhz23	0	*	It isn't violence, no. You threatened me with violence all because I said I never see pro circumcision propaganda, mostly because it doesn't exist in any significant way.

t1_dtju40m	1	*	Second degree murder is still murder.  You don't not call it murder just because it's not as bad as first degree murder.  Mutilation is still mutilation.
t1_dtjm1rw	0	*	No worries buddy.  I'd never heard of Foregen before. I suppose if they manage to get the treatment to work they could use it for more than just foreskins too which is cool.

t1_dtkcbbn	0	*	I'd say it's better to to trust impartial medical professionals over religion.

t1_dtjn7fs	1	*	No.
t1_dtjs8dt	0	*	It's similar, you may look at it as if it was, but it's not the same thing in any biological sense. 
t1_dtk4stp	0	*	So you chose cosmetic genital surgery for your baby. Nice.  And washing your penis should be done whether you are circumcised or not.  Neither reason you offer is valid.
t1_dtji0o0	1	*	Theres no reason to circumcise in the first place.
t1_dtjjtag	0	*	Mutilation isn't the right word for something that makes something look better. I think you are looking for enhancement.

t1_dtky1vy	0	*	You keep preaching what you don't understand. That's cool but you have no right to say you understand an experience I have every day when you on a fundamental level cannot relate
t1_dtjrcx0	0	*	Clitoral hood is the equivalent of the foreskin. Notice how I specified which type of FMG rather than FMG as a whole.
t1_dtkacr2	0	*	I dunno man. Chilean food sounds right up my alley. 
t1_dtjhyzz	1	*	nah, it's quite fine actually. I got it done when I was a baby, and I'm really glad my parents made that decision for me, because I wouldn't do it now.
t1_dtjkf79	0	*	you know, if you cut off your arms, you won' t have to wash your armpits :)
t1_dtj0r17	0	*	Well, let's give you a major surgery with and without anesthetic. Which do you think would suck more? Which would you remember more?

t1_dtiwn1m	0	*	Please read the edit I made. Intent defines mutilation, not the physical result.
t1_dtllhao	1	*	Good to know you speak for all American women.  Shame all the polls disagree with you
t1_dtjeaco	0	*	Children can't legally consent to anything. Them wanting to be like Mom is irrelevant. Parents make decisions for them. 
t1_dtlerbc	0	*	Please tell me the last time you washed off cancer
t1_dtjxn8c	0	*	STFU you baby. That's your own problem if you feel attacked when I criticize you for hacking off part of your baby's dick with no anesthetic. Barbarians.

t1_dtjndwn	0	*	Or just dont be a gross mofo who doesnt wash his dick. Da fuck people
t1_dtjn7mg	1	*	No.
t1_dtkaiy8	0	*	Female genital mutilation is mutilating *any* part of female genitals. Removing clitoral hood, removing the clitoris, sewing the vagina shit, etc are examples of FGM.
t1_dtjq63t	1	*	Almost sounds like it's just a plain terrible idea!
t1_dtkhzlw	0	*	Wow, that's pretty rude and bizarre.  I mean, whether you prefer cut or uncut, to react that way is just rude and mean.  Unless you're a flasher or something.
t1_dt3ubut	0	*	Uh, no, the US give them weapon vouchers. Israel does sell water to Palestinians because water is a resource and you need to pay for that shit.
t1_dt1ezaq	1	*	So since I just made an account and my username is numbers Im a troll?   I guess I shouldve come up with a witty account name such as yours. 
t1_dt1flv9	1	*	Yes. Bush did give Obama his economy. Then Obama turned it around and gave it to Trump. 
t1_dt15y9u	1	*	Check his comment history.  I got through four before Hes whining about Bill Clintons blowjob.  
t1_dt1b1u3	0	*	So what youre saying is that Obama stopped the loss of jobs. Which were lost during the Bush administration. 
t1_dt1go7w	1	*	You'd think it was a troll right? If the election of trump has taught me anything its that he's most likely not a troll.
t1_dt180pe	0	*	I'm asking why the Clinton's can't be brought up on charges when the Republicans run all branches of the government. This includes the DOJ.

t1_dsionb8	0	*	I can find people in India who are different enough from me that they have no problem marrying 12 year olds girls, so people from 10000 years ago...I mean it's pretty self evident
t1_dsjfr1s	0	*	I am not talking about the current ones. The one which was abolished by Turkey after WW1
t1_dsj29wd	0	*	Ya, that guy is such an asshole for saying fucking a 10 year old is bad
t1_dsjvej4	1	*	I wouldn't know about that. I think there are many pedos that don't harm children and can get their release through young looking girls in porn (which is legal).
t1_dsiqcyd	0	*	Ohh the white guys!  How did we not guess that.  We need to start a campaign to stop assisting child rapists in Pakistan.
t1_dsj7fmq	1	*	I mean I constantly am hearing stories of this shit, and they're acting like it's some isolated thing.  Smh.
t1_dv9kclf	1	*	It wasn't that difficult to understand. I wrote it pretty plainly. You have to try hard to not understand it.

t1_dtyxxd1	1	*	Just open the window and take a deep breath. That's even cheaper and long term does just as much good as the chiropractor. 
t1_dtzs5rt	0	*	That makes no sense. How are you the authority to over ride that based on what you have read on Reddit?
t1_dtyy6qg	1	*	No! I'm saying they are liars within their marketplace and all are fools who believe them!
t1_dtyyayb	0	*	I'm afraid there's nothing doctors can do that chiros can't. The only real help with spine issues is the strenthening of muscular corset, ie swimming and gymnastics.
t1_dtz3beq	1	*	To be fair, people use shit like a multi-tool. So this is just taking it a step further :)
t1_dtzf21n	1	*	>well we gotta spend this health insurance money on SOMETHING.  How about a doctor?
t1_dtzecup	0	*	Yeah, and the reason there was an article is because it's controversial and other psychiatrists are trying to call them on it. Right?  That's what you don't see with chiropractors.

t1_dv1otge	0	*	Which is understandable, but we will see if it translate into succsess in the mid-terms. Dems  were polled at a 90% chance of winning the GE. That didn't work out very well.

t1_dv25o9x	1	*	He's made some kind of dumb moves, but to call him the leftist version of Trump is an extreme understatement about how much of a shithead Trump is.
t1_dv2163b	0	*	Nope. He was serious.
t1_dv1pcvg	1	*	Seriously. Most of that rhetoric isnt even US idiots. Sure, some of them tag along to be included in the meme war, but not many really can vote being on another continent and all. 
t1_dv23tym	0	*	Doesn't require being inaccurate about it. It just is most of the time.
t1_dv1zgdh	0	*	Such people were idiots too. The green party? Libertarians? They are even worse. The US is essentially a two party system. Better to vote smart.
t1_dv2141h	0	*	Is it common to own land on both sides of the border or is it because the wall would be at a certain distance behind the border as opposed to being exactly on the border?
t1_dvcb4sf	1	*	Apparently nearly every president has done something similar. Off the top of my head Obama had a frozen yogurt machine installed in the WH and Reagan (I think) had a jelly bean dispenser.

t1_dv3kcom	0	*	So, firms reporting smaller profits and perhaps even losses wouldn't effect the stock market?   You really need to learn what a trade war is. 
t1_dv1kxqt	0	*	Well hopefully Americans will make the right choice in 2020 when Trump's incumbency is challenged by Oprah.  (The right choice, of course, being armed insurrection)

t1_dv1t97n	1	*	Fuck Trump to have backed out of Paris accords and saying global warming is a conspiracy theory
t1_dv1u3qp	0	*	Sorry for the derailing the conversation. I actually mean that. To answer your last question though, it could help Zippy and other users not make the same grammar mistake in the future.
t1_dv1sua9	1	*	SAF? Society of American Foresters?
t1_dv2h1mb	0	*	Just calling a spade a spade. You literally argued in favor of a trade war rather than letting the WTO sort it out. English isn't my first language, but I think I used numbnuts correctly there. 
t1_dv1slly	1	*	> Many of those countries are corrupt, embarrassing, honorless, racist, backstabbing, flip-flopping, (not gun-toting), elitist, unintelligent, fake, giant, and scary jokes.  Oh, kind of like us?

t1_dt0j3ph	1	*	Yes, he had legitimate reasons to dislike the West.    But the fact that you dislike someone, disagree with someone, or even find this someone evil, isn't enough reason to do something evil yourself.

t1_dt0ju5s	1	*	Since people in this reddit define Human Rights however they want I can define murder like that too. ;)
t1_dt0hxly	0	*	So you saying Human Rights should not be universal? 
t1_dt0gle0	1	*	I can understand your opinion. As I said, it's difficult, and I don't care if she is executed. I just think I would decide against it if I could.

t1_dugbnw8	1	*	You said it. 
t1_dugdwpe	1	*	I'm betting you have never spoken up or cared about those issues except as it relates to Israel. If you have, give me a link from your history....  And what contemporary evidence? Cite..
t1_dugm271	0	*	Yikes, most Israelis are mizrahim. If youre going to hide under your covers and sweat about da Joos you should def at least do your research. 
t1_dugcnqf	0	*	...I mean it's more like we took that land from Mexico as those places were once Mexico and something more comparable would be Danes getting mad at Germans in the south or going to austria
t1_dug5321	0	*	Ok I'll hear you out. What should Israel do with these immigrants?  Give them citizenship?   You haven't told us what the right thing is here,  just that Israel bad. 
t1_duga3se	0	*	Picking and choosing laws is the whole point of a democracy. I never said keep all illegals though that's a nice straw man. I do however support a path to citizenship for DACA recipients.

t1_dugbl3z	1	*	but I didn't.  I made a question followed by a plain statement.  If I was going to be up in their ass, it would have actually been such.
t1_dugl2kj	0	*	Yeah, that seems more than probable. I was just providing an example of how a place with 37,000 people could be called a city.
t1_dugbyv5	1	*	So you stay in one echo chamber that reinforces your views so you'll never have to admit you wrong. Gotcha.
t1_dugr8qs	1	*	Most of the people in Europe are also economic migrants, not refugees. Imp? Haha

t1_dskkzbx	0	*	Yep, not sure if were disagreeing about anything at this point haha.

t1_dskq07p	1	*	Fair enough. It also raises awareness about the importance of voter turnout. I would certainly support your efforts. 
t1_dsknuwu	1	*	They're typically open from around 9am to around 9pm from what I've seen, so the vast majority of people can work like normal people and take 30 minutes to drop off their vote.

t1_dtzjw9v	0	*	They don't push a terrible amount of protein, and also have guidelines about how fish, nuts and beans can be good sources of protein.
t1_dtzra8x	0	*	Why not go vegan while also pushing for better animal welfare laws? It's not like you have to choose between one or the other. 
t1_du003dr	1	*	That is an outdated theory.  Even though our ancestors ate meat, it is cooking, particularly of starches) that gave us big brains.  And the greater portion of most human diets we're made of starches.
t1_du0jkme	0	*	But you do know now that this particular chorizo meat is from diseased animals and you're still OK with it because it's cheap?
t1_dtzp64q	0	*	There's nothing wrong with killing an animal when it doesn't need to be killed?
t1_dtzrk5k	0	*	46g for women, 56g for men.  is that really so much protein?
t1_dtzl6oq	0	*	Oh ok so we are embracing the suffering that the smart phones need because of cultural expediency but shunning the animal suffering because of our moral outrage?    Got it. 
t1_du4mlc2	0	*	And people sniff each others asses sometimes during sex and kill their own children? What's your point?  I don't think we'd solve world hunger by feeding grass and hay to the world population. 
t1_dtzmaaz	0	*	Animals don't have culture, you nimrod.
t1_dtzpaep	0	*	It is important to be pragmatic, but I fail to see how choosing the bean burrito over the beef burrito is not pragmatic.
t1_du4slio	1	*	No amount of context makes Lobbying the issue at play.  Corruption? Sure. 
t1_du0ixsf	1	*	Well, that was the crux of my argument. You got me there
t1_dtzl5g5	0	*	OK, go outside and tell the first person you see to stop eating meat. Did that work? Did they care? Probably not.
t1_du0az30	0	*	So if I boil a dog alive, that's fine since it makes it taste better?
t1_du00uqw	0	*	That's a bad argument that can be used to justify any number of things that you wouldn't want people in a civilized society to do.  
t1_dtzydtu	0	*	I don't have a problem with killing, I despise the torture leading up to it in some cases.  That's my bottom line. 
t1_dtzyujm	0	*	Why put effort into scrutinizing and obsessing over where your meat comes from when you could just simply not eat meat?
t1_dtziujf	0	*	How did you find it otherwise? I can't imagine eating the same things every day, I love to cook too much. And luckily almost every place has a vegan option for me, even if just a bean burger 
t1_dtzlvhz	0	*	All calves are saved for insemination?  Where does veal come from?  Are male cows never slaughtered?   So many questions.
t1_du00f72	1	*	I mean, it isn't like other countries aren't oligarchical in this way. Because of the monetary influence, there are no governments that are free of lobbyist amd company influence.
t1_du1z95q	0	*	...my food and companions. 
t1_du01vcw	0	*	Fair enough but that's not what you were implying with 'farming for meat is still almost exclusively done outdoors'.
t1_du0qwcq	1	*	Stop eating palmoil for starters. Or do you want to be personally responsible for killing the rainforest?  Start today please. You don't need palm oil to succceed.

t1_du083np	1	*	Is it hypocritical to use modern tech? Probably. Is it hypocritical to eat meat? Probably. Are we still going to be hypocrites if we stop doing one or both of those things? Probably.
t1_dtzuazh	0	*	I want to know the story behind this!
t1_dtzrn79	0	*	They only get to grow a little bit until they are chopped up as veal, or get sold off as cattle etc. And no they get chow that is cheaper. We literally steal a product of evolution to make profit.

t1_ducky9p	0	*	Yet the fact remains that the animal is in no way different than the plant.  I'm not saying we should be mistreat information animals or plants.  The animal is a means of survival.  
t1_dtzwtdi	0	*	Look, when they prepare these pigs for slaughter, they're not sending their best.
t1_du05jit	1	*	But that's not the point, he wasn't talking about morals, it was about the fact that it isn't easy to change culture. Ethics weren't part of the conversation.
t1_dtzmkjb	1	*	good argument, I'm convinced 
t1_dtzni7u	1	*	Wtf?
t1_du05yrz	0	*	Land for farmed animals is definitely an issue.
t1_dtzx1do	0	*	Not if done correctly.   The girl who came up with it won a nobel prize because she could prove the legitimacy of the method. 
t1_dtzy5dz	1	*	I recommend not digging deeper into the maker of that video because it's one hell of a creepy ride. 
t1_dtzhg3w	0	*	Did you lose your molars or something? Try flossing.  
t1_dtzm7ml	0	*	Idiocy at its finest.
t1_dtzx25t	0	*	How about the fact that we kill more plants by allowing animal agriculture to function? Is it not still better to strive towards things that are more moral? 
t1_dtzsnvs	1	*	https://youtu.be/K1bfvDf6P3Y
t1_du0b1hh	0	*	Not with the aid of technology and the looming environmental crisis. It's inevitable that humans stop (or at least severely reduce) animal agriculture.
t1_dtznpgb	0	*	What about dogs?
t1_dtzkuxh	0	*	Clearly, it's not like he linked the site which has information about it.
t1_dtzldm6	0	*	Staying true to their ideals, they ban any discussion that does not praise the state/subreddit.    .       .    .
t1_dtzz84v	0	*	Additionally, are you familiar with the ethical arguments for veganism? Have you ever studied philosophy on the matter?
t1_dtzo5uv	0	*	What does your diet consist of?
t1_dtzx066	0	*	Countries outlaw animal cruelty twoards common pet species, I don't see how this is a huge moral leap. We impose morality on other humans who don't agree all thentime
t1_dtzxfrl	0	*	So it's really arbitrary? I mean pigs are smarter than those people. 
t1_du0bjxj	1	*	*Crickets chirp*
t1_du0ctdk	1	*	Because the environmental costs are catching up to us. 
t1_dtzxt3t	1	*	Thanks. You too 
t1_dtzk6h6	1	*	Slaves were once property in America, did that make it ok?
t1_dtzpf9e	1	*	This is a very good way of looking at it. If every person who said it will never happen, we don't have enough people joined, there would be enough people to turn the tide. 
t1_dtzkjd6	1	*	B12 is the biggest issue! Luckily, a years worth of pills is about $5.
t1_dtzowf7	0	*	I didn't say they firebombed the houses. Those that knowingly incite violence are just as responsible than the people that execute the violence. 
t1_dtzsjwy	0	*	Humans are animals too, in a way. You're okay with cannibalism?
t1_dtzkwbr	0	*	What else would you like me to cover?
t1_dtzr9hu	1	*	Negligence is a form of torture. No youre not whipping them, but they are still in physical and mental pain. 
t1_dtzkl5b	1	*	You can't actually, most countries  have animal abuse laws.
t1_dtznxju	0	*	Of course I dont think theyre worth nothing. I imagine youd have to pay quite the premium on human flesh though. 
t1_dtzoybr	0	*	>short-term solutions  Oh, okay. Like a boycott or something?
t1_dtzki3v	0	*	We are frugivores look it up
t1_dtzmv88	0	*	Why not? And, moreover, should that stop us from trying?  EDIT: Also, death does not have to be by old age to lack suffering.
t1_dtzy5xd	1	*	Lol. Using some projection there? Have a girflirend and a strong friend base. I'm a relatively well adjusted human being for the most part.   Wrong again buck-o
t1_dtzrkvy	0	*	Yes, because we all know how harsh our laws are on powerful, massively influential industries. 
t1_dtzxr4n	1	*	Something that doesn't exist can't have a will to live. Are you trying to justify the massive meat consumption and the effects on climate with hypothetical cows? 
t1_du0hdbo	0	*	So it all wraps back to if I value dogs over pigs, in which case I do. Pigs are food and dogs are pets. 
t1_dtzkrdv	1	*	Well said
t1_dtzu1im	1	*	Sort of.  I think the human population is currently a bit unsustainable regardless of what you eat.  And if you want to talk pollution, check out what a single plane flight dumps.
t1_dtzx7l0	0	*	where you live, maybe.   neither are staples in my culture. 
t1_dtzx47p	0	*	According to you I am, then again I could just think youre retarded 
t1_dtzpvqr	0	*	Yes, you can, thanks to mean ol big government
t1_dtzxz9c	0	*	...for pleasure.
t1_du02znx	1	*	Are there any good reasons to not kill humans?
t1_du08bup	0	*	That's a big oversimplification. That's like saying all paths in life lead to death, so they're identical because the outcome is the same.
t1_dtzite7	1	*	Mine too I hope :(
t1_dtzwu2d	0	*	I'm not, because I don't eat animals. The question, why do YOU feel that you can impose your morality on others (by paying people to kill animals)?
t1_dtzqnp7	0	*	You seem confused.
t1_dtzqxdv	1	*	And Thomas Jefferson, once thought to be a supremely ethical and intelligent person, couldn't see the wrongness of slavery.  The Dalai Lama is not perfect.
t1_dtzpd7o	1	*	Okay nice intelligent reply to my comment. I never said it was wrong to eat it, I said that you didn't NEED to eat it. I wish the food chain did more taking from dumb cunts like you
t1_dtzxlro	0	*	This same argument could have been used in 1800 for slavery. It always starts with just a few people and slowly turns the tide of public opinion. It's happened before and it can happen again.
t1_dtzu9lr	0	*	why do you presume you are the least invested person in this?  I mean... you did respond after all.
t1_dtztbrl	0	*	And staying warm is good for you, but that doesn't mean you need to go out and buy a fur coat made from kittens, or build your home out of animal bones. We have other options.
t1_dtzit6j	0	*	With that logic, would that make human homocide justifiable?
t1_dtzxpsl	0	*	Are you suggesting that people ought to be free to go around punching babies in their faces, with no fear of consequences or punishment?
t1_dtzoopa	0	*	If you know it's happening and have zero empathy for the animals you're directly killing, I've got some real beef with you. See what I did there?
t1_dtnctaf	0	*	Like what?  what could excuse this behavior?
t1_dt5snu4	0	*	*300k French troops siege Portugal's forts*  *Record scratch, zooms on Lisbon*  Yep. That's me. You're probably wondering how I got in this situation.
t1_dt4aak0	1	*	Theres a metaphor here but all my great writers have been killed so I'm not sure what I should draw from it.
t1_dt4mqkr	1	*	That would be the perfect crime, really.
t1_dt48u3w	0	*	And some guy told me he met some black people once and they weren't nice to him. I guess that's a thing now too?  I guess it only counts as racism when it's not targeting the baddies. 
t1_dt3v6il	0	*	It is such a weird view that I have never seen anything like it and I spend a lot of time online. Like saying Einstein invented GPS because satellites account for general relativity. 
t1_dt4vckl	0	*	Like believing that evolution stops at the neck?
t1_dt4wz8f	0	*	Now you are just being absurd for the sake of word fighting. You win.
t1_dtkdv79	0	*	Sucks to be you then. Annoyed by truth. Harsh. Also, how come you never encountered the Hard Problem then if your love for all things philosophy is so *eclectic*?
t1_dtekjyy	1	*	Yeah, it's a little weird to say an animal sacrificed itself.  Definitely some strange psychology happening there to word it this way.
t1_dtfkfw8	1	*	What and what?   Without proper scientific tools and OBJECTIVE facts we have no way to determine much OBJECTIVELY about conciousness which is my point entirely..... I dont think you read what I typed.
t1_dszlg1l	0	*	If thats your reasoning then why are you sending links full of text to prove your point then ?
t1_dtn9spa	0	*	Theocracy, here we come.  Scratch that, Idiocracy, here we come!
t1_dtn59lp	0	*	In the interest of being neutral, may I ask why you voted for Trump?
t1_dtnpqjx	0	*	I understand you didnt like what i said. But before you get all angry can you do me a favor and use that google thing you mentioned to look up the definition of assessment?
t1_dtn7rpv	0	*	Actually, Obama being president and selecting a SCOTUS appointee was what the American people wanted - given they voted for him twice. 
t1_dtn9hyw	0	*	Well there are many other lively options, investigate, no one has chained you to a rock
t1_dtne6vc	0	*	Exactly. If there's a lack of accountability NOW, that would increase by an order of magnitude if their votes were secret.
t1_dtnqa79	1	*	You are mistaken, it was Kill Bill 2.
t1_dtn8vdo	0	*	i would. its genuinely impossible to hear trumps words and not be repulsed, and to also be a decent person
t1_dtng3pa	1	*	Chances are Mr T, they are already probably voting against your views openly and don't give a crap. Mine are.
t1_dtn60bd	1	*	Probably more like the apes at the zoo. 
t1_dtn7o4w	1	*	That's my fetish!
t1_dtngupw	1	*	And be really careful mentioning astroturfing, that's one of the most touchiest subjects I've found on this website. 
t1_dtn9py8	1	*	Man, this is perfect.
t1_dtncqf8	0	*	You don't appear to be arguing in good faith. I'd side more with your opinion, but you went farther than just present a counter-argument.
t1_dtneskh	1	*	didn't he plagiarize his homework off the Forbes list?
t1_dtn4zaw	0	*	if you aren't repulsed by the ignorant lies and racist authoritarian nonsense trump has said many times then yes, you are an indecent person 
t1_dtoffz5	0	*	The memo is a lie, yes.
t1_dtn6k3u	0	*	It's literally unconstitutional and you're defending him...
t1_dtn6h1s	0	*	Not exactly, Obama admin refused to enforce some older/outdated laws, not a law that literally just passed and was signed by Obama himself. 
t1_dtncjr8	1	*	Yup, that makes sense. I do find it hard to remember that other people aren't often like me on the inside
t1_dtopd85	0	*	Let me remind you this is the article you sent me.... and it supports my argument in its final conclusion. 
t1_dtnbvcw	0	*	I'm not a supporter.  I'm just trying to explain the situation.  I can see now that you've already made up your mind about these events and me.  Have a nice day.
t1_dtn8pi7	0	*	mindless pessimism helps nothing
t1_dtnahf3	0	*	okay, i'll keep believing nondemocracies need to be destroyed, thanks for your permission 
t1_dtn5ylr	0	*	Nope. 
t1_dtn58rp	0	*	based on those words then you must be disgusted by trump. his racist authoritarian words are the enemy of your words
t1_dtnw0j8	0	*	Don't worry, they broke all of their protocols to imply that Hillary had another email scandal even though it was completely unrelated to her. 
t1_dtwo17x	1	*	Haha I'm just now checking my inbox, but I think that's a great idea! Cowboy Man U0001f920 is such an underrated emoji and he deserves more use. I mean just look at that cool guy!
t1_dtngcek	0	*	Didn't 4chan find a terrorist training camp too?
t1_dtnpp6v	0	*	Oh fuck are you kidding me? He spoke to a Russian?? That should be instant death penalty right there!
t1_dtn5ekc	1	*	(facepalm)
t1_dtng8dz	0	*	Just one link to a scholarly essay corroborating these statements would placate me. One?

t1_dtn5vq9	0	*	The White house, whenever you're ready. 
t1_dtncrod	0	*	I feel as though they already do that? 
t1_dtn57eq	1	*	And yet you listen to what he says and thinks hes a good person? And youre a good person for liking those things?  That boggles my mind. 
t1_dtnmiv7	0	*	Yeah, no, it's been rammed down all the alt-right pipes for weeks as bigger than watergate, so that's just plain as day bullshit right there.
t1_dto0p0p	0	*	Failing to report a bullshit meeting is hardly a serious offense...

t1_dtno9di	1	*	Thanks
t1_dtngom5	0	*	It kinda makes sense, they both wanna electrocute the shit out of the gays.
t1_dtn5mds	1	*	Yes, I have to say I believe you are. I don't think a decent person can look at all the things Trump has done, listen to all the things he's said, and still desire him in a position of power.
t1_dtnfi0s	0	*	Thank you!
t1_dtnstht	0	*	>people who have different political opinions than I are not allowed to post on international subreddits   You people are a meme. 
t1_dtn7olx	0	*	You misspelled hors d'oeuvres.   
t1_dtnf0pr	0	*	Just because it was not a DECLARED WAR does not mean that it was not WAR.   Also fact 2 is wrong. For example, look up John Brown. 
t1_dtnwbtm	0	*	Probably because we send armed men into their countries 
t1_dtnhfxy	1	*	At least that happened and we didn't get Hillary
t1_dtnx8pr	1	*	What?
t1_dtn9rwm	1	*	educate yourself before writing something ignorant. im not your father
t1_dtnb656	1	*	oh yea, thats fine i don't care if my comment is influential or not and the downvotes are irrelevant to me or my self esteem lol
t1_dtna25z	1	*	Exactly what a LIZARD MAN would say!
t1_dtnm38a	1	*	Considering how ignorant they are of the law, I doubt it will take long. Plus they might tie back to money laundering and bribe money though the RNC & NRA SuperPACs. 
t1_dtnwxza	0	*	So harming national security = credibility to you? Thats a very strange way of thinking.

t1_dtdqjx0	1	*	That sounds reasonable. Until the rules get tightened. And whenever the government wants they seize some more properties. 
t1_dtdltrp	0	*	ahh yes, proof that you you can't actually answer the question. HOW would a system to compensate owners for their losses not be linked to market values? 
t1_ds29m5i	0	*	>That the nazis were not socialist is a well-established fact  Would you please support your claim with evidence?
t1_ds2c6if	0	*	Would you be so kind as to define socialism for me?
t1_dsz3mwn	1	*	They will never gain that perspective. Their mindset is that the grass must be greener, not realizing that most of the undeveloped world is nothing more than a burnt lawn.

t1_dsz2nuz	0	*	Don't you see how that is irrelevant when we're discussing something that everyone agrees is not a free market? 
t1_dsz2owt	0	*	That is just pure bullshit that is easily proven wrong. 
t1_dsz34ck	0	*	> If we fixed the broken higher education system in this country, we might begin taking steps towards fixing the physician shortage.  Let me guess, this is a pitch for MORE free shit?

t1_dsz5a3l	1	*	The US is an underrated gem of a country
t1_dsz2w9l	1	*	That's not what that was about. 
t1_dsyzqd9	0	*	Thats all very fantastic.  My statement only had to do with people thinking universal healthcare is free, which its not. Its much cheaper than what the US has, of course.  But its not free.
t1_dsz3dbn	0	*	Go back to the Donald with the rest of the inbreds.
t1_dsz3cy1	0	*	No one cares because our Healthcare is still so damn expensive! It's not even attainable by millions of people!

t1_dszb3il	1	*	Better that they exist and some can afford them than to not exist at all. And prices eventually lower.

t1_dsz4t23	0	*	What exactly are you attempting to point at in here that you feel negates what Ive said?
t1_dsz8h66	1	*	Where did this talking point even come from? Health care can be administered at the state level, as it is in Canada.
t1_dsziiu9	0	*	You better make it clear with your household name as a rich person or bank account that you belong then - otherwise you aren't getting away with it.

t1_dsyybur	1	*	Oh please, stop being ridiculous.

t1_dsz3bp6	0	*	It's not about deserve. Getting sick sucks. Someone else not paying for your sickness does not equal thinking you deserve to die.
t1_dsz2u8x	0	*	I mean in a sense, the US model of insurance through employers is leftover from the US imposing wage ceilings.  And then there's the whole HMO thing
t1_dszbphv	0	*	You have a stroke there bud?
t1_dsyy9kq	0	*	I never claimed to be the arbiter for regulation debate. Just explaining how no one actually thinks there is a completely free market. 
t1_dsz3au5	1	*	shh, he cant se the difference between Venezuela and the usa,  and wouldn't mind choosing to live in Venezuela. 
t1_dsz1vro	0	*	Generally. You do realize some Canadians venture into the States to pay for healthcare because the job can't be done right in Canada? Wait times are longer in Canada than the States. I can keep going 
t1_dszr9go	1	*	It people wanted to purchase it, insurance companies wouldn't be dropping like flies right now.
t1_dszbavc	0	*	> How is that better?!  I had gold level coverage, now my work has dropped it due to increased prices. It was considerably better.

t1_dsz0e4t	0	*	It's per capita, population doesn't matter.
t1_dsz0wl7	1	*	Insurance companies were created by government? I mean, if that's the case I guess it makes it easier to transition to single payer.   Are you dumb or are you pretending to be?
t1_dsz027p	1	*	as if every race desnt do that or as if every minority does that. lol
t1_duq5ho6	0	*	Just make sure you keep watching past the first 30min or so. It starts out a bit boring but goes completely off the rails. Basically a thriller only the events are real. 
t1_duqmtz6	0	*	I think having them all sit one out would have showed the world the IOC isn't playing around. This feels like a concession that wasn't necessary.
t1_dur2b4z	1	*	This is the documentary that got the Russians caught in a sense. It's specifically about the corruption in Russia regarding Olympic doping.
t1_dtrm3hl	1	*	My alma mater is the University of Arizona. Tuition is $12k for in state and out of state is $35k. U.S. Education prices are still pretty gnarly.

t1_dtsn1wn	0	*	What did they need democracy to solve exactly? They were developed and governed as a colony. What did they need to solve since then that differentiates them from the rest of China?
t1_dtracg6	0	*	point being, its not hard for them to learn english communication skills.  most of the tech workers arent native englisih speakers anyway.

t1_dtqx1o6	0	*	Pretty much the same prices as all SUNY (New York state) schools. Though now with a new NYS fund, you can $0 tuition as long as you work in the state for 4 years after.
t1_dstdnjl	0	*	Thing is, in the case debated, Europe is not asking UK to join. Europe doesn't need to make concessions.
t1_dsrfyin	1	*	It is democratic though. The EU is a body of nations, and they chose between them to not give the UK a special deal. What is authoritarian about that?
t1_dsrf55y	1	*	A poll is meant to represent the people. This poll shows the people want a voice in the outcome.   Your third comment shows u don't get how polls work. Look up random sampling.
t1_dss352m	1	*	Brexit and Brexiter
t1_dszb3bv	1	*	Wow thats a lot. As a Californian, I wouldnt mind succeeding since the US federal government is a joke right now. Would never happen tho. Thanks for enlightening me

t1_dtxs76q	0	*	I think you're still misunderstanding. Ignoring private spending, we spend more tax dollars per capita on healthcare than the vast majority of countries.
t1_dts0upy	1	*	Which is the fault of the government not encouraging competition.  But yes they are very similar, Im just arguing for the speck of light in the tunnel compared the government having autonomy.
t1_dtu1v0k	0	*	What makes you say it's dumb?   Plenty of non-rural people voted for all of those things.....
t1_dts36b3	0	*	You cant even leave the country to get a procedure. I cant fathom my government not letting me get a procedure out of my own pocket. 
t1_dtsggkq	1	*	What do you think happens in Canada? Do you think police come to your door because you missed your doctor's appointment?
t1_dtt7rlw	1	*	I don't know what subs you frequent. Maybe in the_donald that claim is made all the time, but I've never seen the end of civilization mentioned outside of the context of nuclear war. 
t1_dtsamon	1	*	If only the left in our country would allow private care aswell then right?  Look at Bernies plan again.
t1_dtsookg	0	*	I meant minimally regulated, not some libertarian utopia, just something like any other market we have, like phone plans market if you want a specific example.

t1_dsjxoh7	0	*	I'll just set a reminder to mock you when his term elapses. 
t1_dsikxdp	0	*	Japan was brutalizing Southeast Asia. It sucks that it came to nuking two cities, but they would not give up willingly and it's better to make the enemy lose life than lose your own people.

t1_du13m8b	1	*	Or Donald Trump?
t1_du18cok	1	*	Yeah, despite what they may say North Korea isn't communist. Redefining things, like tax, communism, and greatness until they fit seems to be a government hobby.

t1_dt8ytzk	0	*	What else?
t1_dt8zbxc	1	*	What does trump typing a tweet have to do with orangutans?

t1_dtxa6yf	0	*	It's only compulsory if you are registered. If you are not registered nobody comes looking for you.
t1_dtxohxi	1	*	If you get caught speeding, the police look up your Vehicle Registration, which is a state level database.  They only know your address because you registered your car.
t1_dtxf8dc	0	*	Yeah, and the US doesn't have one of those, and the people in the US really really don't want one.

t1_dud2q55	1	*	FOUND ONE!
t1_dud0tav	0	*	That's certainly true.  Many Americans don't want to be The Big Brother anymore though, and they want economic justice and a social safety net.   I'd hardly call that 'shallow' or 'simplistic'. 
t1_dud046h	0	*	That is literally the entire narative.  To say differently is creating a straw man or to be willfully ignoring what is being said.
t1_dud0sto	0	*	I'm saying democrats have never won the electoral college but lost the popular vote so there's literally no frame of reference for saying the electoral college only fails when your candidate loses. 
t1_dud7rq2	0	*	No, I meant the parent comment(s) to that from u/ScumwithBoundaries. Dumpsterfire was brought into this illegitmately on a discussion of choosing Sanders vs Clinton. Sort of the Dems own whataboutism.

t1_dud56au	1	*	Thats true, I suppose all we can do is just wait and see for now.
t1_due1atw	1	*	Also as a reminder to readers, more Clinton supporter voted for McCain than Bernie supporters voted for Trump.

t1_dsvbd9o	0	*	Nothing is more destructive of respect for the government and the law of the land than passing laws which cannot be enforced.  Bet you can't guess who said that.

t1_dua5rff	1	*	They are, generally.  A single counter example does not disprove the general case, this is not a philosophy debate, it is a real world discussion.
t1_dtq2phu	1	*	The positive effects of diplomacy vastly outweigh the very concept of parking tickets.  You would not find success with a policy that violates federal law.  
t1_dtptzp5	1	*	The population of La Paz is 780k. I'm sure it's quite the feat.   What about the cars already inside the city?
t1_dtp16tz	0	*	I believe that is the ethical theory of Negative Utilitarianism. I.e a ruler who is able to instantly and painlessly destroy the human race, a benevolent world-exploder, would have a duty to do so.

t1_dumpuhz	0	*	because it's hard to believe anyone would prefer being burned to death? idk its a tough call 
t1_dumtu53	1	*	I wouldn't argue that someones life shouldn't be due to pain.  Only that person can make that decision.  Writing off 90 peoples lives without their input is supreme arrogance.

t1_duma2js	0	*	Well they were taken. What are you planning on doing about it?
t1_dumb8oj	0	*	Naw, it wasn't a joke. It was just really lame sarcasm.   I don't know when misplaced sarcasm qualified for 'a joke'. Jokes typically have structure; most often bookended with a humorous punchline. 
t1_dtrhdcs	0	*	Well, that's hilarious and also depressing.  I didn't think there were actually people out there who thought that Antifa were literally terrorists.
t1_dtrtmql	1	*	True enough, man
t1_dtrw86k	0	*	That's what a far right extremist is.  A nationalist.   The people who think (insert nation here) are chosen by (insert higher power) to rule the world. 
t1_dts7gc6	1	*	I'm saying that most Westerners would consider a Chechen or Bosniak closer to a Muslim than they are to one of them.  They're wrong obviously. But a Chechen would absolutely be labelled a terrorist.
t1_dtsfdix	0	*	Yes, Germany. The country that not even 100 years ago hosted one of the largest genocides ever documented. No country is innocent 
t1_dtrzjx4	0	*	Enjoy the paddy wagon dragging you to a federal pen next protest antifa

t1_dt04bfg	1	*	No argument there.  Buchanan, to a degree, was accidentally awful.  Trump seems to do awful things with a bitter determination.
t1_dskxkt0	0	*	I'm an American, but that'd be my guess yeah.  But also, you're still only addressing one of the four points I made. Even you prove it wrong, it doesn't mean my greater point is wrong.
t1_dskwdgb	0	*	I didn't make that assumption. I was refuting the OP's claim that JOBS IN MURICA PAY BETTER. which is also a universal claim, but I don't see you attacking that.
t1_dskpsca	0	*	Finally something we can all agree on :D

t1_dsjsrhj	0	*	That didn't answer his question. Not English speaking doesn't translate to 'not useful'.   You know how many chemical engineers there are that don't speak English? You think they are useless?
t1_dsken1x	1	*	Immigration policy is not right wing though. Many, many left and right wing political ideologies support low immigration for a variety of reasons. It is not a conservative idea.

t1_dsbiknh	0	*	Guilt might have helped get the Partition Plan passed at the UN. But the Plan was never implemented. Jews born on the land fought for their land, that is how Israel was created.
t1_dsa92sb	1	*	the fact that zionists built and moved to Tel Aviv decades before the holocaust is irrelevant to your argument that Israel was created soley because of the holocaust?
t1_dsapk82	1	*	I'm with you on that. It just illustrates the whole ethnic cleansing much better. In Israel proper there are only 20% Palestinians left. Before 1947 they were the majority.

t1_dt477f2	0	*	What if you don't want it to stop? You could be lying
t1_dt5it0e	1	*	It doesn't have to be that way.  We can create a society without private property.
t1_dt6g71x	1	*	Idiot, the USSR was perfectly functional.
t1_dt7yryd	0	*	Can you show me where the mongols committed genocide?
t1_dt8sxkx	0	*	Um, how have any of the things I mentioned short lived or how did I describe it as a race to the bottom?
t1_dt6mbii	0	*	How is this relevant to European imperialism?  Btw I would support japan taking in more immigrants. Because that is the only imperialist nation you mentioned. 
t1_dt6gzk4	0	*	because angst. 
t1_dt6lc5l	1	*	What am I? A chef?
t1_dt6uwfy	1	*	...Trump was raped by a gym teacher? I suppose that explains the hatred of exercise...
t1_dt7oyak	0	*	Here's a solution, just off the top of my head: minimum working age requirements enforced by Apple. 
t1_dt75f4s	1	*	Ahh that's what I thought
t1_dt6l426	0	*	And how do you know that? [There are actual statistics on voter migration, you know.](https://wahl.tagesschau.de/wahlen/2017-09-24-BT-DE/charts/analyse-wanderung/chart_204972.jpg)
t1_dt6odeb	0	*	Not penal colonies which was my argument
t1_dt6dzwz	0	*	Yeah, western soft power is pretty damn high. Everybody's wearing jeans and listening pop music so we're cruising for a Cultural Victory
t1_dt6dd3v	0	*	Pretty sure Native Americans are still around. Pretty sure 80-90% of their population died from Smallpox. But you obviously don't care about reality. 
t1_dt6b5kg	1	*	Nah, it just screams that you know nothing about the actual situation in Germany (or about economics in general, for example).
t1_dt6lfdp	1	*	I can smell the down votes from here!
t1_dt89crg	0	*	Wrong about what? Just saying that who gets the most votes from the most people is the winner in most cases.

t1_dt6qro9	0	*	That would be the Protestant Reformation... the other was literally in England. It was more of a subjugation.
t1_dt7tv6d	0	*	So... Tibetans were saints, and it's OK to kill people so long as you're counting them as foreigners, even if they're native to the land you're living on?  That seems to make sense.
t1_dt6hy8e	1	*	Also not true, most of China are shopping in a bull market.
t1_dt6p22t	0	*	And now they are dirt poor and have nothing to offer to anyone. Those few countries that sacked half the world a century ago, however...
t1_dt6lec1	1	*	But Ireland is the country that emigrates to everywhere else and not the other way round so its kind of an unfair example.
t1_dt6jwau	0	*	Then maybe those societies should re-evaluate why having kids is so expensive and encourage it through policy rather than just words.
t1_dt6ok8a	0	*	Not really relevant though. The argument is that some countries got rich on the backs of others.

t1_du626au	0	*	Hit me up with some sources then?  And no, movies do not count.
t1_du60ojj	1	*	Men do it a lot more often. And it's a lot harder when you are left when pregnant or right after childbirth (where the baby is much more dependent on the mom).

t1_du61ft8	0	*	Yes. I don't see your point...
t1_du61ty4	0	*	So I take it you're in favor of the death penalty then too? Who decides who can be helped and who can't? Most countries that advocate for rehabilitation over punishment have a lower recidivism rate.
t1_du61x98	0	*	No we do not.  
t1_du60vb4	1	*	Yeah, that's about what I figured you'd have to say. Nothing worthwhile. Remind us all when the Intergemder Dynamics awards are on prime time television again in the Fall pal.
t1_du61chd	0	*	Which is a form of revenge. Punishment is revenge. Rehabilitation is not.
t1_dugek69	1	*	That's it - if you don't ask, you don't learn.  I've never got the mindset that tries to punish a person for wanting to understand.
t1_dueuabl	0	*	Well then youre not looking hard enough. Dont mistake his bully pulpit for immunity just yet.

t1_ds5cmqy	0	*	Seeking out a meeting with a Foreign adversary who promised you stolen information about your political opponent is illegal in America   At least for now 
t1_ds5ks2j	1	*	In CA our craps and roulette games are played with playing cards. Basically as little fun as them not being allowed in the first place. 
t1_ds5t8hw	1	*	I'm just comparing the two, not advocating those as the only options.  
t1_ds5z6tt	1	*	Mine as well. People look at the recipe and get grossed out but goddamn is it good.
t1_ds687cd	1	*	Impeachment, and the results are what America needs. The truth should come out.
t1_ds5dbx7	1	*	It was at points last year.
t1_ds59t60	1	*	Everything is super! Thanks for asking.

t1_ds5ovqf	1	*	Thank you!
t1_ds60pw9	1	*	Stfu punk
t1_ds5oss8	1	*	Exactly, Ford pardon Nixon because he did not want the rest of the admin mired in the ensuing court case. He thought it would destroy the country.
t1_ds65r09	0	*	Why does that even matter? If everyone got a tax cut, would prices not go up as a result? Everyone would have more money to spend, so merchants would be able to charge more.
t1_ds5otuk	1	*	Has nothing to do with it sounding good or not.  Todos means all.  So the way he would want to use it is porque no todos, which would mean why not all. Not exactly the same message.
t1_dsyy1p5	0	*	Wow you're awful and you don't even know it
t1_ds5reic	0	*	Not just a time sensitive one, but a politically sensitive one. There is a potential for a mini or even full scale civil war if this investigation is not perfection. We need to let the man do his job.

t1_du21d2c	0	*	Oh look, the right wingers learned not to have the_donald in their profiles.   Go back to lying about taking drugs while hitting on girls. You sound twelve. At most. Killfiled.

t1_du1aepe	1	*	I made you that upset?

t1_dv3i9rm	1	*	I'm gonna draw a line here. Don't copy them.  What someone likes for comedy is up to them.  Liking and not liking things based on politics isn't our game.

t1_dv39s5a	0	*	Not really. I just said that I hadnt heard of Milo because he was censored but rather when he said something so disgusting that it was newsworthy. That disproves your point. 
t1_dv3d7nm	1	*	Dont know if you're being condescending or not but Please feel free to rummage through my history, you'll see im a middle man through and through. I call both sides out constantly.
t1_dv3r6ek	0	*	I've already provided evidence
t1_dv3c3z5	1	*	No, it's a democracy.  The GOP put themselves on this path and handcuffed us to their runaway train.  The day we stop believing in democracy is the day we say we're okay with this happening again.
t1_dv3aoun	1	*	I didn't downvote you. I was just elaborating your exasperation on the issue and bringing it into context. It really does boggle my mind that people hate Obamacare but know nothing about it
t1_dv3smjo	0	*	Your comments are just speculation, too, I presume. If I am wrong, feel free to exercise your right to downvote me.
t1_dv3pdy1	1	*	I want to get off Mr. Trump's Wild Ride.
t1_dv3mlac	1	*	no, you don't have the evidence.  mueller, by the very moves he's making, has the whole story.    there are plenty of guarantees.
t1_dv3dif1	1	*	Dude if your trying to be a SJW on Reddit, your going to have a rough time. Relax and enjoy your weekend.
t1_dv35of6	0	*	I'm talking top level comments with thousands of upvotes.  It's the same thing.
t1_dv3b563	0	*	Which would functionally be compelling speech, as the only way not to reveal the warrant in that case would be to take affirmative action to update the warrant canary against your wishes.
t1_dv37b8k	0	*	this is my [loadout](https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/26dcNYXHjaAuXA1qgmtb5epMYG2Y/26-2048x1229/v1/c700x420.jpg) watch your fucking back you slug

t1_dv38p5o	1	*	Cool.  Ow! The troll bit me!
t1_dv3da4m	1	*	I'll use this opportunity to say we don't hate the Russian people, but the government is becoming a rogue state and I myself do hate Putin and his group of bandits
t1_dv397yl	1	*	The irony of you of all people calling someone a moron. 
t1_dv3b84r	1	*	Imagine being so consumed by propaganda that you believe garbage buzzwords.
t1_dv5qb0m	0	*	This article has absolutely nothing at all to do with my post. Congratulations, you are dumb.
t1_dv3m5pd	0	*	Not that, that's for sure. You're just talking shit, like you lot did about Obama all those years. Don't pretend that you're not full time racist, sexist pieces of shit.
t1_dv39syk	0	*	Not me bro I got a good brain
t1_dv3b28l	1	*	Just putting the flag out there... 
t1_dv37cbu	0	*	Soooo, is there a class action prospect for advertisers getting bad info on number of users and their data?
t1_dv4vepm	1	*	I'm not claiming what you think I am, check the usernames again.  The link is just a shitty way to prove it
t1_dv37brj	1	*	Look at you invalidating me just because i have a few thousands upvotes on t d which you can clearlysee by going to my profile
t1_dv3asgt	0	*	He freaked out when someone mentioned other people having a fragile ego, so yeah, he definitely is one of em.
t1_dv366cs	0	*	Yeah but you still look like a pretentious ass lol
t1_dswhls4	0	*	fair enough, I won't push it further.  I apologize, I had assumed you were another of those american-nationalists who think your country can do no wrong.
t1_dt5h4o1	0	*	Nope. I refuse to watch right-wing quackery like Fox.
t1_dt7xulm	0	*	> They will try to extend brutal, murderous dictatorship anywhere they can.  Seeing how the US is responsable for much more invasions and foreign deaths than China... no.
t1_dt5w90g	0	*	My mistake, I did not realize you meant this president!  I thought you were speaking about, the president, in general.
t1_dt66u0f	1	*	I'm talking about China.
t1_dt6tmkz	0	*	so,neither occupied or annexed. 
t1_dtb1yx9	0	*	A bomb is way easier to build in your garage. I think you'd need a decent setup to effectively make guns. Guns would require metal building.
t1_dtbblj6	0	*	As a Texan, what the holy metric fuck are you talking about?
t1_dtbcn1n	1	*	Lol, Australia was literally populated by English/Irish criminals, has had waves of immigration since and still dont feel the need to kill each other at anything like the rate you guys do.
t1_dt63pxk	0	*	You insult me too though? Why should I take you seriously? Typical hypocrite right here. 
t1_dt4tqzk	0	*	And the EU put tariffs on Chinese imports, while the US taxes all solar imports, even those who are not dumped. 
t1_dti9nv4	1	*	A witch hunt.
t1_dthhncu	0	*	If they convict him in a court of law without secret evidence, I will believe it. Until then what do we have besides speculation?
t1_dspsux2	1	*	Homey let me put a rocket on your house and see if you still think it's not a threat.
t1_dspljlq	1	*	So you had already posted your source when you wrote:  >If you would like I have the primary source boss. Just say the word.  What was the point of that besides empty bluster?
t1_dsplmna	1	*	A real report.
t1_dsrgu7a	1	*	rofl internet credentials of super soldier in ruins. 
t1_dspqjts	1	*	how *are* you?
t1_dsputkm	1	*	That is not what he is saying. He is saying Palestinians are always lying and Israel is always truthful.  That is clearly not the case, as you yourself admit.
t1_dsqndxe	1	*	https://www.timesofisrael.com/four-year-old-killed-in-mortar-attack-named-as-daniel-turgerman/ Tell that him.
t1_dt2kmnv	1	*	hold on to that doubt. and i'll hold on to my popcorn. and when it's too late you can cry and beg all you want, we're not coming to liberate you. you still owe us for the last one
t1_dt09pmc	0	*	Yes, its almost as if more people in general cause more crime.
t1_dtwic4r	1	*	Lol, I watched the show and loved it. The movie was my 4 yr old sons choice not mine.
t1_dtuvdrq	1	*	Are we talking about Americans or Volkswagen?
t1_dtwfgrb	0	*	I don't think you make a difference between CO2 and cancerous particles.
t1_dtv0n0t	1	*	I did my research this morning. Im now informed thank you for forcing my hand to learn! And saving me from embarrassment by telling someone wrong information in the future.
t1_dttw5l3	1	*	So fear is the motivator in this situation. Really shitty. I'd be one dead slave because I would get the fuck out of there I don't give a shit if I have to live in a bush. Then or now
t1_dv2c9wk	0	*	The insidious Muslim Jews who want honest American coal to fail, smh /s
t1_dv2kdiv	1	*	Yeah. It makes him feel better. 
t1_ducftdh	0	*	I'm not advocating denying it to anyone, at all.
t1_ducubgs	0	*	Fortunately, Trump is completely useless and incompetent.
t1_dski4kx	1	*	Third-party, write ins and/or blank votes.  Doing nothing just validates the system. See, no one is voting outside the two parties. 
t1_dskh4wd	1	*	That may be, but one of them sucks on a completely different level. Voting for Trump because Hillary sucks is like shooting yourself in the head because your soup is cold.
t1_dslrdn2	1	*	There are ways to succeed in any situation.
t1_dsk6wtj	1	*	I dont give a fuck what Fox says.  I do care how OUR president carries himself.  Trumps existence is out of line.  Good night, im done debating your false equivalencies.  
t1_dsf9v5k	0	*	Yeah, you oughta go do that instead of sitting here spewing lies about it.
t1_dsf4lct	0	*	No no, western culture includes many different cultures, I want you to pick specific WHITE cultural aspects that apply to ALL white people.
t1_dsf65dt	0	*	I'll be back in a year to see how much of a slam dunk this was.
t1_dsfg1sa	0	*	So having a disproportional amount of white men isn't some kind of discrimination already?
t1_dsgo1ly	0	*	Please. Link them. No one ever can. People cite them and then always refuse to actually link to them. It makes me think they don't exist
t1_dsf16h4	0	*	You're kind of dumb
t1_dsf5wua	0	*	This is an allegation in the lawsuit but there is literally no evidence or context provided for that allegation at this point.  I'd be interested to see how the defense respond to this.
t1_dsf46u0	0	*	Way to move the goalposts there champ.  No, white =\= Western culture, that's the typical racist dog whistle crap
t1_dsf5tsr	0	*	Would it matter if I said yes?
t1_dsf57re	0	*	It isn't. You're allowed to call it that, just like I'm allowed to tell you you're wrong.
t1_dsf3col	0	*	That's not evidence for what your claiming though
t1_dsf6w24	0	*	Crying hard
t1_dsfbtb4	1	*	There is no hostility. That's your peeception.     And the rest of your writing is more of the same, agenda driven rhetoric.    
t1_dsf3kum	1	*	The study [I've found regarding grades of men and women in core CS courses](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042815024933) suggest men do slightly better.
t1_dsfsgzx	0	*	So what do you think he meant with this:  > Philosophically, I dont think we should do arbitrary social engineering of tech just to make it appealing to equal portions of both men and women.
t1_dsf0vr8	0	*	it will be illegal so the statement is useless
t1_dsf9z4j	1	*	If the evidence in this case shows that there was a systematic torpedoing of white males based on their race, gender or sexual orientation, they need to throw the book at Google.
t1_dsyvd9u	1	*	That's the biggest item. You will notice that Ukraine is violating the ceasefire terms by moving weapons and restricting the movements of the monitors.   What did you get out of the report?
t1_dsxv1v1	1	*	TIL basic geopolitics are obsolete thinking. /r/worldnews is hitting a new low in terms of comment quality. 
t1_dtrdoq8	1	*	I think Twitter is where you go to bitch for a free coupon when Burger King puts mustard on your sandwich instead ketchup.
t1_dttgr3y	0	*	Hahaha free donuts. Thats hilarious how close to home all that hits. Where are you that nowhere is open that late? Also, as far as I know, Walmart doesnt sell nitrous, right?
t1_dtt82n1	1	*	No. You are getting closer to the correct answer tho!
t1_dtro7ge	0	*	Nah. Just when I'm in Walmart
t1_dtrm9p7	0	*	I'm talking to the people who use tabs as a 'save for later' feature. 
t1_dtruuhc	1	*	underestimate
t1_dtrv32i	1	*	Thank you for your response. I would like to check out of the social media platforms because I feel like I'm missing out, however, I'm starting to think I spent way too much on Reddit as it is. 
t1_dtrk79a	1	*	That's because the central valley is one of the few places in California where you can buy a house without being a millionaire.  
t1_dtrnm6a	1	*	Like the Whitehouse
t1_dtrsv6v	0	*	This is why Google's Circles method was so great.  Too bad they couldn't market it well enough :\
t1_dtreawo	0	*	Bald hookers painted yellow in jeans overalls.. mmm 
t1_dtsh9ax	0	*	Well, I did. And half the commentators here are saying the same thing, so...
t1_dtrxnpd	1	*	Yeah you can. You just gradually let them weed themselves out when they realize they don't like you or respect you. Facebook is a great way to separate the wheat from the dusty shit that blows away.
t1_dtrjy1h	0	*	WhatsApp has encryption.
t1_dtrfznw	0	*	He isnt wrong though.  family photos clog up facebook for everyone but moms. 
t1_dtrkxe2	1	*	Plot twist, he was an 'agressive liberal' all along!
t1_dtrgstd	1	*	I ran out of soap. 
t1_dtrfvp2	0	*	Thanks for this. Its damn well worth a try. Thank you very much. I have an idea of what to do now. 
t1_dtt676u	1	*	I was talking mostly about being in a Walmart
t1_dtrp6aw	0	*	Interesting.  Has it always been like that, or when did they undergo the split?
t1_dtrlgsb	1	*	Huh, didn't know that. Thanks.
t1_dtrasqz	1	*	You see, it's casual racism with minion pics. Just like your parent's fb feed.
t1_dtruezf	1	*	Wait what?    you can't be yourself when your family members are on your friends list.  You need to grow some balls man. Emancipate, Now!
t1_dtrrih4	1	*	On same level, they know how gullible they themselves are, and that's why they were trying so hard to warn you!
t1_dtrhckm	0	*	From where I'm sitting it seems to have a pretty good shot, tbh. Especially with UPI payments integration due soon.
t1_dtrvpky	1	*	Exactly. Say it were a different situation and the woman found out she was being discriminated against and could threaten legal action against the company. HR wouldnt want a discrimination lawsuit.
t1_dtrtlxs	0	*	This was about 10 years ago. When i was 18 just starting college. Now I dont care. I have a great mom just very nosey.
t1_dtrd1e4	1	*	It works for her and Dell is fulfilling her need / want. Don't judge. Sounds like she's happy. :) 
t1_dtrdsrx	0	*	It's a comedy. And yet, at the same time, you're not wrong. It's kind of depressing. 
t1_dtrdphs	0	*	Wow, that rumor has escalated. A few years ago the story was he was a marksman, glad he made it up to SEALs.
t1_dtro0hz	1	*	I see, interesting
t1_dtrasdp	1	*	Haha yeah basically. Everyone selling, few buying. 
t1_dtrlpol	1	*	But only on certain servers. It depends on which one you chose to believe in when you started playing.
t1_dtrggdu	1	*	Hm. Maybe if I drink it over a long pipe disguised as some sort of shrubbery...
t1_dtrtnxs	0	*	So glad you found each other ufe0f
t1_dtrifpm	0	*	or you could do it for free?
t1_dtrese3	0	*	Unfortunately a useless idea due to the invention of the tunnel, the ladder and rope, the catapault, the postal service and the drone.
t1_dtrensf	0	*	Wtf. Please tell me none of these memes have appeared in your feed. Please, I beg of you, please
t1_dtrbopq	0	*	Where do you live?
t1_dtrkblv	1	*	Fuck off
t1_dtri7uc	0	*	Sounds like you haven't explored reddit all too much, I've seen some stupid shit on here.  /r/SubredditDrama/  Have fun, you'll find reddit is filled with the stupidest of the stupid.
t1_dts8uvh	1	*	Yeah, she totally knew what she was doing.
t1_dtrl0t5	1	*	Reddit being an echo chamber is something I see repeated here daily, over and over, more than any political belief or opinion. 
t1_dtrfie3	0	*	Holy crap. The war on drugs is bigger than i had ever anticipated!! This stuff in cans, what did you call it? Air? Ban that shit immediately!
t1_dtrlqtc	0	*	> or lower paying jobs  You can find lower paying jobs than a Walmart?
t1_dtriouw	0	*	I'd hate to disagree, but I agree with your comment
t1_duue94k	0	*	Acceptance is the first step to solving your addiction problems. Get help man.
t1_dtt4d52	0	*	What makes you think I don't connect with people in a personal way on FB?
t1_dtroyzd	0	*	Doesn't that make your mil look bad, not you? It's like airing all the family dirt for everyone to see rather than keeping it hidden at home. 
t1_dtslm7t	0	*	Then you're talking about the opposite thing I'm talking about cause I'm asking what platform has the same all-in-one service
t1_dtro1ia	1	*	Well if you don't just delete your Facebook then you are either going to be paranoid about what you say or paranoid about your settings. 
t1_dtrhc3l	0	*	[u irl](https://xkcd.com/1782/)
t1_dttg5sl	1	*	If we're expected to live to 80, 40 is the halfway point, so the middle must start at somewhere before that.
t1_dtrbpnw	0	*	I think it's a type of computer. You know, like they sell at Radio Shack and Circuit City. 
t1_dtrx887	1	*	I would be angry too if I had to help people for my helpdesk job.
t1_dtrk3x3	0	*	Predatory practices such as selling below cost will put competitors out of business, giving the predator a monopoly and the ability to raise prices substantially.
t1_dtrpqk6	1	*	Yes.
t1_dtrwegt	1	*	NewgamePlus is only a rumor in some religious guilds. Others believe you can spectate, or join a new server, or you're forced to log out forever.
t1_dtrk86s	1	*	That's the reality in many small towns.  There just aren't too many other types of businesses that want to go there.
t1_dtrr5d3	0	*	Are you the kid from Mr Robot 
t1_dtrjnza	0	*	I thought they were collecting meta-data (location, contacts, etc.) from Whatsapp and using that for whatever monetisation they can.
t1_dtrqo5l	0	*	Well then, open as many tabs as you want! 
t1_dtrair0	1	*	He means WWW
t1_dtrpzgb	1	*	Facebook groups, group chats, etc. are all ways of getting around it. Thats what I do.
t1_dtsp205	1	*	That is IRL around me. It's why I Reddit... Facebook is for pictures of your dinner or cat or something, not my thing
t1_dtrekpa	1	*	Low income and high birthrate neighborhood? Ya dont say..
t1_dskk9gw	0	*	blacks are just as racist as whites in STL. I'd say even more-so it seems sometimes. This town is racist by design and it is very very slowly coming out of it, but it has a long way to go. 
t1_dsjja8u	1	*	Being a non-black person in a (poor and) black area isn't usually a good idea.
t1_dsjdfde	0	*	Burden of proof is on you if you want to say that central America is being oppressed by the USA.
t1_dt37d2d	0	*	It wasn't a thing until American companies started buying cheap Chinese panels... 
t1_dt3bcgi	0	*	You should probably ask them to provide evidence that they are sourcing renewable, and not having them say as much.
t1_dui1tef	0	*	I mean it isnt that hard to drink without a straw while driving or walking without spilling it all over yourself dude. Cup -> mouth is a process you shouldve really learned by now
t1_duhq1bv	0	*	Hep C isn't transmittable via shared food or drink, not that there aren't other pathogens that can be transmitted this way.

t1_duby2cn	0	*	you're a special kind of stupid.
t1_dugblgy	0	*	1. The FSB pays me per comment. 2. You seem to be saying there are more genuine Brockbots that falsely accused ones. 3. Youre supposed to call it the classic Russian technique of whataboutism.
t1_dubdgrq	0	*	Google translate is an automatic option when you use chrome. Read the article in chrome, youll be able to understand it. Id love to know your thoughts on it. 
t1_dubonp7	0	*	I was/am extremely anti trump and disagree. 
t1_dubf794	1	*	Instead of invalidating the source, why don't you read the article and explain what exactly is wrong with the study?
t1_dubrcon	1	*	The florida school shooter was *not* a registered Democrat. You've fallen for fake news.
t1_duchiu3	1	*	Sounds like user error, bro. Stupid is as stupid does. Also, the company isn't even profitable.  
t1_duc614o	0	*	Would you use this same argument to argue against spending money to counter terrorism?
t1_duchz16	0	*	Stop being so PC, everyone knows there is a difference. 
t1_dubnxo4	0	*	No, I've avoided it like the plague the whole time I've been on reddit for exactly the reasons you're complaining about. I'm not here for dumb images macros. 
t1_dubtzj1	0	*	Edison?
t1_dubqmn2	1	*	What I said is related to Republicans trying to politicize fake scandals to distract from the genuine Russia story. 
t1_duc82u5	1	*	Im not saying it didnt happen but Id be shocked if it was even 5% as organized/sizable as the efforts for Trump. 
t1_dub8gkk	0	*	>  I am not even in America or the USA.  How much time have you spent in the US?
t1_ducucsh	0	*	Google the name lol I'm done wasting time on someone too ignorant to learn. 
t1_dubnxzr	0	*	Yeah, this shit isn't up for debate
t1_dubr5sn	1	*	1. Ive read it, it is very vague. 2. No I havent.
t1_duc7myz	0	*	care to explain why?
t1_ducj4ht	0	*	I find it funny that you think 538 is biased because ESPN (a news company) bought them, but you linked to HuffPo.  HuffPo is owned by Verizon.
t1_dubesn6	0	*	The uranium deal, while admittedly very bad looking PR-wise, is not really a scandal considering several other unrelated government agencies also signed off on it.
t1_dubs8f4	1	*	Pretty much. Posted more often than one person could have with out the use of bots and it was during the election cycle.
t1_dubciv6	0	*	rofl, YOU are naive if you think impeaching Trump will solve ANY of your problems  you are delusional
t1_dubfnar	1	*	Yep! I've said it before their is no use in talking with Trump supporters the best you can do is play their game and troll them back
t1_dubowqo	0	*	You don't know if I read the thread? You clearly fucking didn't.   Edit: oh look, another one https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/7xt5oy/trump_ended_rule_to_block_mentally_ill_from/duax9f9
t1_dubp3t3	0	*	Completely. I hate the guy just like the rest, but this website makes me love him just because of the anger they have for him. 
t1_dubrjdo	1	*	Well I am russian, and I am innately opposed to this, so am I wrong to call foul play in a comment where I see one? 
t1_dubfpeq	0	*	Please dont shoot up a school

t1_dubp26l	1	*	But Russian bots. But Russia rigged for trump. 
t1_dube17a	0	*	Yeah I've met them before. I got him to stop, though. He told me to have a good night. Thanks for your concern!
t1_dubqqcd	1	*	But what about... is not a counterargument.
t1_dubrowv	1	*	What planet do you live on? 
t1_dtkxr1z	0	*	Look at the bright side! At least losing half of the human population to what should be easily treatable diseases might wind up easing the pressure on our environment for a bit. 
t1_dtkzmnt	1	*	November 1993 was a weak issue.
t1_dtmd4e4	1	*	What does your response have to do with it still being a brain drain regardless.
t1_dtmem8t	0	*	If you want to be extremely pedantic about it.   Again, you avoided the question, how does this have any relevance to the matter of if humans are supposed, or not supposed to eat meat?
t1_dtl0cp7	0	*	'Ol musky? 
t1_dtl0624	0	*	The point I'm making is that letting bacteria lose its resistance means people dying of infections. Routine surgeries would become extremely dangerous.
t1_dtl7yaf	1	*	Only if youre dumb enough to get a wound of any kind 
t1_dtl0sm6	1	*	And after saving humanity a small programming error in a software update turns all the nanites into a organic eating self replicating grey goo...  
t1_dtnpill	1	*	We should do both. Killing animals for pleasure is immoral regardless of how many people there are on earth. If we can feed the population with a plant based diet, then we should. 
t1_dtlj2ej	1	*	Well played lol. 
t1_dtl4a4j	0	*	I've grown up happily in the post antibiotics era and it scares the crap out of me to think of the world I'll be living in *after* antibiotics if no other cures are discovered.
t1_dtmb4dr	1	*	*squeezes my bladder*  Nope... seems ok here, no leaks
t1_dtlfe8e	1	*	Obviously they try to copy different animals and different cuts, they don't just grow some cat skin cells and say yup, looks like meat.

t1_dtl8beg	0	*	the image you linked is really low quality for some reason, i cant read the labels. do you have an alternative link ?

t1_dtl0851	0	*	Now, i wonder which country gonna doom us all faster? U.S. is also trying hard: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_carbon_dioxide_emissions
t1_dtlcpvp	1	*	Which are all given to the plants fed to animals anyway. So the use of the things you have mentioned would actually decrease since crops>meat is an inefficient process.
t1_dtl18z8	1	*	An Emporer of Mankind, perhaps?  I'll join the IX legion!
t1_dtko6f6	1	*	Haha, best kind of right. Poison that you're not intentionally buying!

t1_dtl3kzw	1	*	Yeah I took Calculus in high school, but it was part of an Honor/Advance Placement (AP) class. To graduate, you were only required to take Algebra, so most student opted for the bare minimum.
t1_dtl04s5	1	*	Woosh
t1_dtkyrrm	0	*	Privatizing the NHS will increase the pay for doctors and nurses.
t1_dtldfrb	1	*	Well its the thing fucking up the planet the most, and the most excused thing by omnis.
t1_dtmt96n	1	*	considering every nonwhite guy's dream is to get themselves a white girl, yep.  
t1_dtlyf5c	0	*	Cheetoman doesn't give a fuck about legal or political structures and if there was ever a reason for that to be a good thing, this is it. 
t1_dtli951	1	*	Not at all. I eat meat myself, but I'd be happy to eat lab-grown meat. My issue is with meat eaters who wouldn't even *consider* it because it's not the same.
t1_dtljyq2	0	*	I only say that because you are shrugging off a huge problem by basically saying you don't care about other people and only care about your own taste buds.   Absolutely insane. 
t1_dtm5gjv	1	*	Oooh yum ! And now I'm romping about in Oh She Glows :) Thanks for this !
t1_dtkyy4n	1	*	The only useful thing there is in meat that isn't in beans is vitamin B12 which is a pretty inexpensive supplement. 
t1_dtls711	1	*	Oof owwie my feelings!
t1_dtlmf1w	1	*	At what point do we send in the CIA to taint medication stockpiles? Not like they ain't done it before.
t1_dtno3c8	1	*	IMO we  ought to impose quarantine restrictions on any country which doesnt have effective laws preventing antibiotic abuse, with a requirement to sterilise every item leaving those countries. 
t1_dtl14pr	0	*	I don't pretend to understand them, but they do bathe in and drink water that has rotting human corpses in it. 
t1_dtl9b4v	1	*	No, seriously. If you want to end animal suffering, go ahead and abstain, that will save a couple lives - but for the antibiotic problem, it will do nothing. You need a policy change for that.
t1_dtkyrzg	0	*	No because developing countries don't want to.
t1_dtlcmtp	1	*	>If everyone in the world swapped to being vegan today
t1_dtlni8a	1	*	They're the ones making our antibiotics 
t1_dtmabfz	0	*	A large number of people in India are vegetarian, probably more so than a lot of other parts of the world. 
t1_dtl98oj	0	*	You're crazy. 1000/1000 vegan-by-choice people lead perfectly normal, competent, functioning lives compared to 1000 people that eat meat. 
t1_dtkwfih	0	*	It's both. There are millions of people in america that think education is a waste of time and/or liberal brainwashing. 
t1_dth3agh	0	*	What about the things the house intelligence committee has confirmed to be true? Do those count?
t1_dthd3bu	1	*	Lol 
t1_dthm1v3	1	*	Lol you changed the topic to something irrelevant then accuse walkeyesforward of not following the conversation. God you people are fucking dumb. 
t1_dthj68r	0	*	It is as literal as a metaphor can be. It was a campaign to convince people that Hillary was evil. 
t1_dthin7t	0	*	Who are the murderers you're referring too?
t1_dthlomf	0	*	Because Trumps are by and large things that remove federal power or fall well within the purview of the president while Obamas often abused executive power.  
t1_dtj2ofu	1	*	Maybe at one point, but not anymore. You'll still get banned just the same for dissenting.
t1_dthkgck	0	*	Me either... U assume that the government wasn't corrupt and everything was great... But now all of a sudden u can't trust the government
t1_dthhipd	1	*	Wow, Liberals are mean! 
t1_dth22jl	0	*	So newspapers making mistakes and retract them is fake news? guess we have different definitions of fake news.
t1_dthek5a	0	*	Aka youre a liar and have zero basis for your statement!!
t1_dtj4tr8	1	*	Yes, I'm sure you're the type of person to only believe things once they've been proven in a court of law beyond a reasonable doubt.
t1_dthedcd	0	*	PS there is no constitutional crisis. Calm down.
t1_dthj33h	0	*	I don't think you understand what the word metaphor is. Nobody thinks the term rat race, or dog eat dog, or elephant in the room, wolf in sheeps clothing, have anything to fucking do with animals. 
t1_dthtqjh	1	*	You literally called all conservatives morons who don't think about anything but themselves.  That is painting with a broad brush. 
t1_dthwhys	1	*	Dont forget about the Dijon mustard!
t1_dthplke	0	*	Obama, as the president, is allowed to participate in foreign policy decisions.   That's not a problem. 
t1_dthq4eg	0	*	Did you read it?  I don't think you read it.
t1_dtjrmq4	0	*	Man, I'm glad I dont surround myself with people like you. No wonder some people are so depressed. Hope your life turns around some day.
t1_dthc28v	1	*	Guilty pleas and indictments are nothing to you?
t1_dtgztpg	1	*	The irony of saying someone is using partiasian hacks as proof while posting fox news articles as proof...
t1_dthcqzq	0	*	Smart people think Trump is a genius. 
t1_dtior20	0	*	you must be fun at parties
t1_dth39fx	0	*	For someone who seems to have a very vested interest in muddying the waters on this topic you have very little knowledge on the actual details involved.
t1_dthru28	1	*	You may have to cite your sources on that one
t1_dthxdyj	1	*	The private party picked their own party member, and she still won the majority of votes in the primary
t1_dthcl1l	0	*	Still waiting on your source that says otherwise. 
t1_dtij4sf	0	*	There's a PM feature for that, you know.
t1_dthtlrc	0	*	Still looking for someone to point out where I said Obama didn't do anything.
t1_dthmz7r	0	*	Funny how even in your mocking you're accepting that the right is bigoted and motivated by intolerance of others. I know the irony will be lost on you but I find it amusing.
t1_dtjfmco	0	*	I really do not understand what you typed here. Perhaps there is a language barrier?   Do you, or do you not believe that a country should protect their citizens and elections from foreign propaganda?
t1_dthb09l	0	*	Notice how you still won't actually answer the question.  LOL
t1_dthlcux	0	*	You accuse me of ad hominem while using an ad hominem.    I questioned his bias which is perfectly valid.  Youre using the fallacy fallacy
t1_dthtks3	0	*	I don't think any one person could possibly know the ACA like the back of their hand... 20,000 pages...
t1_dthigz0	1	*	And yours of your telepathic abilities!
t1_dthg41z	0	*	Yes the court says here, modify this so we can rubber stamp your request.
t1_dthi6o5	0	*	>Downvotes for telling somebody to not be a smug prick. Good shit guys. Keep it up.  And you keep up the cyber-patrolling Constable Fermit.
t1_dtikmmj	0	*	LOOK AT YOUR FAKE POINTS LOL.  Like I said yesterday, straight up fucking stupid.  Not worth the time or effort.
t1_dthldij	0	*	Didnt Trump complain about how much time Obama spent golfing? Trump has gone on way more golfing trips. How are you able to ignore this information?
t1_dthdjsn	1	*	Definitely could be. I think Trump was in on it. My original point was that the dossier has not been confirmed by any credible source, so to say it has been is wrong.
t1_dthh4qn	0	*	Context clues are hard huh? I bet you stopped reading after those three words.
t1_dthcmr0	1	*	Bro you have some weird fetishes. 
t1_dthf519	1	*	well obviously the cop beat you silly in retaliation 
t1_dthlmz6	0	*	Well if youre worried about the stock market you could move your investments to more conservative bonds with a few hedges. 
t1_dth7lb6	0	*	huh? *one* conservative blog post would mean that statement, if literal, is like 1-5% wrong, lol. 
t1_dthnx9j	0	*	Apologies if I misinterpreted but in my experience the only reason people bring up anecdotal stories like that is to make a broader generalization. 
t1_dtiffpp	1	*	Targeted drone assassination of a US citizen without due process, for instance. And his son.
t1_dthicy1	1	*	>but you do realize that youve just further proved his point, right?  It's more that I don't give a rat's arse about his point.
t1_dthr6t5	0	*	But he cant pass anything
t1_dthlv43	1	*	Talk about irony. You realize the person you are defending's post was literally just shitting on everyone who doesn't hold the same opinion as him.
t1_dthxazg	1	*	True that. He was supposed to invade Texas and use FEMA to imprison conservatives in abandoned Walmarts. Totally dropped the ball on that one.
t1_dthaxdm	1	*	> Until charges are filed we wont know  Exactly, so to say the FBI has confirmed the Steele Dossier is flat out wrong.
t1_dthafq2	0	*	...So you're trying to call me out for being on point for the topic I brought up and you commented on? 
t1_dthja5o	1	*	> Who was paid by Clinton/the DNC during a campaign.  Damn it. That was indeed someone else.
t1_dthifm4	1	*	All of the reports on the connections between Trump and Russia? 
t1_dtu16ks	1	*	Why don't you let that conversation end as it began, with you as the sole participant?
t1_dthdet4	0	*	Coming from a muh Hillary emails Dotard in a discussion about treason, Im just trying to speak your language? 
t1_dthewzh	0	*	I still dont' get it, idk.  Trump is guilty of money laudering -Where's the proof of that? You're being pedantic.  What am I missing?
t1_dthf8n6	0	*	What a boring way to argue. Have a good day, man
t1_dtgzqfs	1	*	Wait, so what explains George Pop. talking to the Aussies about this shit?
t1_dthurc3	0	*	>trying to minimize it  Yes, that's why bombings increased under Obama as compared to the already insanely militant W
t1_dthmqyv	0	*	Cool bro. Have fun in your echo chamber. Hope you enjoy the next 7 years.
t1_dthj56j	0	*	You're talking about the specific report?!  Only four wrote that report.   Others wrote another report  https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3254239-Russia-Hacking-report.html
t1_dthiqfh	1	*	Oh damn guess I misremembered. I was basing it off the comment above saying that they used the Dutch as the ultimate bad guy one season. Ill edit it to fix it.
t1_dthimd5	0	*	You are utmost welcome!!! I am also not surprise that you took that as a complement. 
t1_dthis1m	0	*	I pointed at the proof above.  You're just covering your ears and yelling, I can't hear you! like a three year old.
t1_dthdi87	1	*	Oh, I guess all those other things don't mean shit then, because you think possibly he got taxed less this year.
t1_dthumik	1	*	Working on it.
t1_dth8hus	0	*	Why don't you go speculate over at the dipshit or cringeanarchy 
t1_dth3kte	1	*	No worries. At least it was a full quote that I could search. 
t1_dthsg77	0	*	Surely appealing to everyone who isn't far right is an impossible task? 
t1_dthco9e	0	*	Thats like, your opinion, man. 
t1_dthgobg	1	*	Why do they have to turn up wrongdoing?
t1_dthi318	0	*	Because I think the GOP is corrupt? OK... 
t1_dthshes	1	*	This reality doesn't have enough seats.   NEXT
t1_dthlt8x	0	*	Y u so mad? U new to politics? Sounds like it otherwise u would of known of the scandal 
t1_dtjswng	0	*	Such a clever come back, you must have felt like you really showed me with that one, well done 
t1_dthjhvk	1	*	There will be no impeachment, and Trump will not face any charges. He may not win re-election in 2020 though.
t1_dthgf70	0	*	But see, if someone's talking about Micheal Jordan and how he was a great athlete, it's a bit rude to jump in with how bad his baseball career was.  Don't change the subject.
t1_dthacm5	0	*	Hey man I asked you to list them.  You're choosing to throw hissy fits over here instead of expounding.   Can't imagine why.
t1_dthfmxv	0	*	 Please clarify who You guys means then. You've put words in my mouth, not the other way around. I look forward to your response. 
t1_dthze4n	1	*	How does attacking their religious beliefs improve the situation? Another easy way to separate the masses.
t1_dthllbv	0	*	He needed it rephrased.  He never understood it the first time.  
t1_dthimy1	0	*	So the system works? Report bullshit get suspended.
t1_dthk233	0	*	People like you make the world hurt. 
t1_dthlbzx	0	*	You're continually ignoring what I'm actually writing and going off in a totally different direction.  I'm not sure why.
t1_dtimq4h	0	*	That sounds wonderful and everything, but it shows a pretty blatant lack of self-awareness.
t1_dthcrme	0	*	If you honestly believe Trump is a dictator, you have already lost the critical thinking game. 
t1_dthi4gv	1	*	>extremely angry  lol wat  reread my post please, friendo
t1_dt16exh	0	*	That is a fair point.   Im curious on your stance on government subsided insurance programs for crop and animal protection?
t1_dsset4v	0	*	Majority of Russians that lived in the ussr want it back. Can't see how rich people controlling your life is any good
t1_dss69x8	0	*	Ummm..no.....it isn't socialist if it's actually a right-wing dictatorship which is the opposite of democratic socialism, and simply calling themselves socialist don't make it so son.
t1_dsipu1y	0	*	Yep. Emotional and angry because you were presented with facts that made you scared.
t1_dshb2d2	0	*	I love how terrified Americans get.
t1_dshepb1	0	*	Not ashamed. It's just irrelevant when talking about America.  I'll give you a hint. We dont spend trillions on wars of aggression while denying healthcare to citizens.
t1_dsio8hp	0	*	Facts aren't edgy or so brave. Try to actually respond from a side of reason and facts, not this place of emotion and fear.
t1_dtozblu	0	*	It's not okay to be a Klansman.
t1_dv0fgq6	0	*	They didn't ban the *sound* tho
t1_dv145r5	1	*	True. You're right, poor choice of words and I have to admit I was wrong.
t1_dtaowbh	0	*	No, what's ridiculous is how you respond when evidence is provided.
t1_dthae8a	1	*	3 million more votes than Trump, just saying. 
t1_dtha4ch	0	*	There are a lot of Democrats saying it, yes... which would mean they should probably be sanctioned themselves for discussing classified information?
t1_dtgijw5	0	*	The 3 million votes she beat him by felt that she was pretty in touch with their interests. 
t1_dtgoxq5	0	*	still doesn't answer my question...  I don't see trump funding Anti-American groups but i sure do see Soros funding Antifa
t1_dth6k7u	1	*	Are you responding to the wrong person?
t1_dthe743	0	*	If it's that easy, why hasn't anyone tried it?
t1_dtgitks	0	*	Of course he would. If nobody rolled out the guillotine, why wouldnt he?
t1_dtgghlk	0	*	Huh, kind of funny that its a game about accurately hitting a small target, far away.
t1_dtgqg71	0	*	whatbaoutism is shorthand for please dont question my glaringly obvious hypocrisy and instead focus on this total true statement i made without any supporting evidence
t1_dtha7h9	1	*	Oh ok go back to Congress Trey Gowdy. Trump lost the majority vote and appeals to extremists who fall for demagoguery 
t1_dtgi52o	0	*	Clinton was a bad candidate, but she did also have a foreign enemy working against her as well. It's not totally fair to blame the dems for this. Trump got help. We cant forget that.
t1_dthbvso	1	*	> played to the moderates  Seeing as 90 million people out of 200 million registered did not vote, he failed miserably at appealing to moderates.
t1_dtgqiyo	1	*	So he gets to run the deep state? /s
t1_dtghoq0	0	*	French love Democracy. 
t1_dtgyp6z	1	*	If we make political descriptors relative, then no comparison between times and countries can be made.
t1_dtggg2r	0	*	> The military will no longer will listen to him, and he has no authority.  Thats the real trick isnt it? Thats how all of this works on paper, but we all saw what happened to Ned Stark.
t1_dtgn8tp	1	*	> a subtle dig  Are you sure on the subtle part? It feels rather in your face\^\^
t1_dtggp2a	0	*	Clinton didnt step down. I dont know what youre talking about. He was actually acquitted of all charges by the Senate, just like Johnson.
t1_dtghwqv	0	*	they only lost because of an archaic system that gives more value to votes from people that live in the middle of nowhere
t1_dtgi5v7	0	*	Congratulations! That's what happens when you join them in believing Workers' Rights are for communists.
t1_dtklrrp	0	*	lol i don't think you'd have any velocity left at 400 yards and a .22.
t1_dtgwbw8	1	*	No no, I'm fairly certain I replied to the right person.
t1_dtgnc67	0	*	Literally none of his comments say anything like that. Its almost like you're just making arguments up
t1_dtgoy9j	0	*	Whataboutism the new liberal buzzword. Didn't answer his question. 
t1_dtgil71	0	*	They ran someone that got more votes than the president though. Gerrymandering is the real problem here. 
t1_dtgsieu	0	*	Nope we're not doing any of that bad shit.  We're doing awesome. USA! USR! USR! 
t1_dtgosyg	1	*	> couldnt win against a fucking turnip.  Well she won the popular vote against that turnip...
t1_dtghtm1	0	*	50.?
t1_dtgpt0e	0	*	I think the term your looking for is precedence. 
t1_dtgzr8i	0	*	Yah, that's not what treason is lol. Might want to read the statute. 
t1_dtglfcz	0	*	Again no rational argument is made. Just some crude put down because of a spelling mistake. Cowards all of you.
t1_dtgo828	0	*	That's the crux of it. Revolutions aren't easy. And as I say, right now, the inconvenience outweighs the outrage. 
t1_dtgngge	0	*	So they did open fire in 1800's. That didn't stop the labour movement. More it was a rallying cry to just be more adamant about it and adding police brutality on the list of ones political causes.
t1_dtgxnp4	0	*	I don't know, in this scenario it doesn't really sound like Trump is the one getting fucked.
t1_dtgmxgw	0	*	Like with daca, declaring Jerusalem the capital of Israel, or federal marijuana laws? This really isn't unprecedented
t1_dtgm1b7	0	*	Because people like you shut down when you hear opinions you disagree with. You're the worst kind of anti-intellectual. The craven kind.
t1_dtgi02n	0	*	Please tell me specific personal damages.
t1_dtgdkuu	0	*	Incredible. The one crime you'd think nobody, absolutely no-one, could justify, and they found a way to not onlt do it but make it about Christian values too. 
t1_dtgmypr	0	*	He could be caught paying a pornstar off after fucking sher and they wouldn't bat an eye.
t1_dtgmttp	1	*	And the Russians are the Visigoths, waiting to sack a fat and weak America.  Whoa. I never thought I'd say something so cold-war-era unironically.
t1_dthbvhk	0	*	You're right.  We should never question US omnipotence.  
t1_dtgjg3j	1	*	Thats not what impeachment means . . .
t1_dthyhlr	1	*	Australia has mandatory voting. It's much easier to physically vote too. 10 minutes in line, and you're done. 
t1_dti0vrk	1	*	Not an American so your NSA can put me on a list. Some pressure on your capitalists wouldn't go amiss if you know what I mean. Put some fear of God into them, if you know what I mean. 
t1_dtgkqww	0	*	Republicans impeached Clinton for a bj. 
t1_dtgi2zj	1	*	The President's duty is to enforce the laws of the land. He's neglecting that duty.
t1_dtgjjtd	1	*	Maybe if you really want to fuck the case, you'll use all the current proof.
t1_dtgn75z	0	*	Hey, thanks for the statue in NY harbor, and for financing our revolution 200 years ago... we were wondering if you would be available later this year? We really could use your help again. 
t1_dtgi89s	0	*	Whoa you think Americans will get unemployment benefits if they lose their job protesting? I want to live in your fantasyland 
t1_dthlh50	0	*	this whole discussion is wrong, as is most of what gets circled in this /r/politics and generally reddit. 
t1_dtghpb1	1	*	Guys, without the French we wouldn't have America. They probably know a thing or two.

t1_dtgrqgi	1	*	This comment led me to check the NYTimes and it is still [*not* on the front page](https://imgur.com/a/nhM3g).  Extremely disappointing behavior from our country's paper of record.
t1_dtgnrrc	1	*	The fact that Trump won says a lot more about this country than it does about the democrats. 
t1_dtgn4si	0	*	Personal attacks are a sign of a low intellect.
t1_dthlrm2	0	*	The point is that you won't be aiming. 
t1_dtgmnl7	0	*	I'm going to take that as a yes
t1_dtgqnez	1	*	But she did win, but thanks to gerrymandering she didnt.  I know that sentence doesnt make sense, but it does.
t1_dtgoq82	0	*	36% last week but 81% among Republicans. They, much like his base, remain unfazed.
t1_dtgjqkc	1	*	It's not the content of the bill that matters, it's the fact that it's not being enforced, literally a constitutional crisis. That is grounds for impeachment.
t1_dtgi1cv	0	*	I'd rather kill myself
t1_dtghx70	0	*	Like, I don't need the income, but I'd get fired if I took 2 weeks off.
t1_dtgmlqg	1	*	Impeachment doesn't mean you're no longer the president...
t1_dth73fz	1	*	We both know that if Macron had lost none of that wouldve happened. France has its own nationalist/racism issues to deal with as well. 
t1_dtgnexd	0	*	It does matter, we just won't see the effect of it. I don't think Mueller needed anymore ammunition but he just got some.
t1_dueqjun	0	*	Because you can't pour tofu into your bowl of oatmeal? Lol. Don't get me wrong, tofu is a great source of protein. It's just that soymilk and tofu have different uses in meals.
t1_dtyiud1	0	*	This is clearly, by far the most logical answer.
t1_dtz5g8v	1	*	We aren't talking about what happened.  We are talking about being lied to by that man's administration.  False narrative is a fancy term for a lie, if that is what's confusing you here.

t1_du02rnv	0	*	Yes and the same happened in WW2.  You are telling me we should have waited for reform?  
t1_du01ljo	1	*	Do you think more people are likely to die if a bomb goes off in Missoula, MT or Memphis, TN? It's an equivalent situation here. Newsweek is lying with statistics by omitting their context.

t1_ds16k4s	1	*	My understanding of head coverings etc was that theyre to protect a womans modesty. Is that the case? If so, do people believe that this should apply to a 6 year old?
t1_dsev9nv	0	*	So just because we can't, you prefer to side with the accused than the accusers? No wonder women don't come forward with their accusations.
t1_dseu72q	0	*	Which is why he is friends with Bennett and has not spoken regarding the Markolim fight.  Or the budgeting of religious settlements   Or frankly any other middle class issue 
t1_dsf9onm	0	*	Happy and confident I'd believe. Well-adjusted not so much.  When they can't relate with the immigrant families or  understand why poverty continues to exist, I'd have to say there are missing values.
t1_dux093k	1	*	Incorrect .. PST is included in the transfer payment model.. so if AB puts on a sales tax .. they in turn have to pay more into the transfer scheme.
t1_duygk5k	0	*	Yeah, not nearly the droves you seem to think, friend. 
t1_duwlue4	0	*	Period? 
t1_duxgol9	0	*	Im not in favour of cuts to anyones salary. This all sounds like taxes are too low to sustain the healthcare system that Canadians expect and deserve.

t1_dux1h2q	1	*	Yeah I get that. I dont disagree. Wtf does it have to do with what we are talking about? 
t1_duwo6o4	1	*	Soo... the middle class will shrink and implode on itself. While the poor will be the ones to reproduce......... I see the class shift already 
t1_duwyfh7	0	*	If money isn't time than that person doesn't work for a wage and is only an owner of the labor causes of capital. 
t1_duwug9w	0	*	That's probably why I said one of the quickest ways to $50k. Are we done talking about how the entire nursing profession is underpaid and moving to this new topic now?
t1_duxilai	0	*	Hearing something doesn't necessarily mean it's correct. 
t1_duxup4d	1	*	The trick is to learn we all jump to conclusions far to easily. The older I get, the less certain I am of everything and the more I see the failability of experts. 
t1_duwor2o	0	*	Free work dilutes the number of paid hours of work. Do you need more than basic math?  Volunteers are scabs for capitalism.

t1_dubhqpl	0	*	So is your point that we should ban all non-life saving procedures on children if it is painful? Or is your goal to gaslight the issue and say it's all painful and forced so it doesn't matter?
t1_du9nrrl	1	*	Mutilated cock is honestly disgusting and visually unappealing. I understand that most of us here love mutilation, but there are no cons to not circumcising if done  correctly
t1_duftxbu	1	*	Because hes got no lateral thinking  or forward planning, hes erratic, petty, and cant haggle. All in all, hes a complete idiot. 
t1_dufwhmr	1	*	Was their own fault... Okay bye
t1_dua2n1i	0	*	Girls *are* being hurt by it (unlike dancing naked around a bonfire covered in honey and yak milk), just as circumcision hurts boys.  Should it be legalised for the sake of equitability?

t1_du93d5l	0	*	Ear piercings happen to young children all the time
t1_dub83g6	0	*	Does it impair men from having sex? Are their penises nonfunctional? I agree there is a minor change but the question is whether it is rises to the level of harm, which it does not. 
t1_du97pcw	0	*	Why? According to those who had theirs removed in adulthood sex is far less pleasurable than before.  How many generations of men have never had the full enjoyment of sex? Bizarre practice.

t1_du97tq1	0	*	Nobody would stop you from getting one.  It's about putting the choice back in your hands.  It baffles me that people fail to understand this.
t1_du96yk8	0	*	making the case for beauty is just subjective.  all males love their circumcised penises, and this debate threatens them because of that love.

t1_du6t0yn	0	*	I know this, and I'm in favor of all countries doing this if China continues to do it. It hampers free trade, but I don't see why it's okay for some to do it and some not.
t1_du79lbs	0	*	Canada? Where we have a perfectly functional democratic system with limits on campaign donations?
t1_dud5f51	0	*	Right, I think we just don't know yet, either way.  I don't think it's accurate for Trump to say that these indictments prove there was no collusion though, which is what he's saying currently.

t1_dtgx4l4	0	*	Won't disagree with you but it's bullshit to claim the GOP (or the US for that matter) started the war in Afghanistan. People would have called for George Bush's head if we hadn't gone in.
t1_dtgfupq	0	*	Oh well in that case ... what are you complaining about? People move places. People change views. Parties/candidates change views. That's not some conspiracy it's just economic and demographic change.

t1_duiztxn	0	*	I wouldn't say that. He's actually really smart and dedicated, but his political views are naive and misguided (in my opinion). 
t1_duiytoh	0	*	They're blatantly trolling at this point. I'm not surprised, it's a crazy touchy subject in Russia. They have to send out every last troll to argue this point.

t1_dsuyv96	1	*	I assume you're trolling, but obviously making decisions based on criteria that happen to be correlated with race does not make a policy racist.
t1_dsuv43r	0	*	Isn't the point of taking immigrants that you can pay them less? If you had to pay every one more wouldn't you just take the citizen that can already speak English?
t1_dtnuj68	1	*	Well, unemployment is at an all time low!

t1_dsv1bbn	1	*	> if you don't see anything racist  Check education and wealth level for Mexico and a Canada.   oh no facts are rayciussssssw REEEEEEEEEE
t1_dsviyh4	1	*	40% of 53 is 21.6.
t1_dsvkusu	1	*	How is it an open border policy if those coming across the border would need a visa to do so? That would make it restrictive, no?
t1_dsv78on	1	*	It was going up at a faster rate before the ACA was enacted.
t1_dsuu0uo	1	*	Lol wrong. She completely ignored states that she lost in the upper Midwest. That was why she lost.
t1_dsuufue	0	*	The motive of the move is the issue.  He began it as part of a bigoted tirade, made this decision, then allowed it to proceed.  At no point is this about solving a serious problem.
t1_dsuz70h	0	*	>but everything seems to say it's pretty small either way.   ...which means blaming immigration for low wages is silly and not based on facts.
t1_dsuyplc	1	*	too funny

t1_dsv3gnh	0	*	Or got the popular vote.
t1_dsvy8i2	0	*	Well, you seem pretty worried about these Haitians taking your job.
t1_dsuty2h	0	*	He is not citing some kind of specific research paper. In my opinion asking for source of something that is very easy to find is being a bit of a cunt.
t1_dsuxey5	0	*	Where are those numbers?   Also I didn't insinuate you were dumb. Get over yourself.
t1_dsux3io	1	*	Politics is what you argue about when you don't have much going on.  Source: bored at work with a poor signal. 
t1_dsuubhk	0	*	Yeeup. But it's ok, average wages go up because making richer people get richer averages it out! /s 
t1_dsvlv6w	0	*	Yes thank you for repeating my words...
t1_dsv58tc	1	*	Ugh, I love that historical recipe YouTube channel! And his response to the mockery was wonderful. The gentlest man on earth expressing great anger- but with grace. 
t1_dsv0izi	0	*	How is it racist to guess someone from Norway is white? It is around 90% white, same with china which is 90% Han
t1_dsv58id	0	*	are you equating a country to a home? No, it's more like a church, or a gym.
t1_dsuy1eq	1	*	And will the gains from that trickle down? Yes, down into offshore accounts.
t1_dsutl1y	0	*	ah yes, everyone who disagrees with me is a dumb dumb and doesn't understand history
t1_dsuxl5m	0	*	The legislation targets low skilled Haitians. I was asking why we shouldn't take doctors instead. That is not a straw man. 
t1_dswjizx	1	*	Its a lot easier to argue in the hypothetical landscape isnt it?
t1_dsusgv4	0	*	That's like saying killing 2 people doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things since there more than 7 billion people on earth.   It doesn't matter whether it's 1 or 100 million. It's still shitty
t1_dsuuc84	0	*	No you can talk politics without falling into identity politics.

t1_dsut9gn	1	*	QED: Trickle down doesn't work
t1_dsurwiz	0	*	Shitting on the floor is innate if you live in Haiti, the rest of us learned how to invent chamber pots, plumbing, and finally toilets.
t1_dsuu7w7	0	*	When the electoral college was added to the constitution the US was more than 90% rural. It had nothing to do with the modern urban population majority being resented by the rural minority.
t1_dsvqtg8	0	*	68 families is NOTHING and from what I've seen there's been a steady decline in applicants. For a country owed nothing by the US they've done pretty good already 
t1_dsvjlum	1	*	Do you think the country is worse because of immigrants?  If your point were correct, this wouldn't be a fucking discussion because there wouldn't be new immigrants. Christ.
t1_dsurm9f	0	*	You don't have wage exploitation with Visas.  That's the point.  It forces the wages to be paid legally.
t1_dsv6w64	1	*	What, were they upset about the whole That all men are created equal schtick? Of course that wouldn't set well with them, lol.
t1_dsuuxhx	0	*	What did I day that was incorrect, or is ur wrong the best you got
t1_dsy7bc4	1	*	You'd like that, wouldnt you?
t1_dsv3cm3	1	*	Nope, but thanks for playing. (I'm not even engaging, this is hilarious.)
t1_dsusp7i	0	*	Better ban Canadian immigration then since they have the worst overstay rate.
t1_dsvuhfn	0	*	You sound very close minded and know me pretty well for having never talked to me buddy. If you're happy playing the us vs them game then so be it. Enjoy your fantasyland
t1_dsuugi5	0	*	Is doing an electrician's job without an electrician's license not super illegal? Nobody is fucking hiring someone who can't even speak English to do professional electrical work, dude. 
t1_dsuv4wz	1	*	Well I dont necessarily agree here but it is an employers market as they know there are more than enough people to replace anyone that wants higher pay, certain perks, etc. 
t1_dsv5dg8	1	*	fair enough, good point.
t1_dsv4opi	0	*	I think you mean ideal  Striving to help people who have less than you is a good ideal 
t1_dsv0pqt	1	*	English is the standard lingua franca, to be fair. 
t1_dsuuzdt	0	*	He said American workers were undervalued, not overvalued. So, he never argued that people should be paid less; in fact, he argued the opposite.
t1_dsuuzf2	1	*	More like Cognitive abstinence amirite
t1_dsv7iy2	0	*	American here. I don't want the low wage jobs
t1_dsuthd0	0	*	https://wallethub.com/edu/states-most-least-dependent-on-the-federal-government/2700/#red-vs-blue  Federal aid vs. Tax contributions. Blue states subsidize red states, at scale. 
t1_dsvk4jf	1	*	Designation of a country as eligible for temporary protected status is itself temporary.  So, while the program as a whole is permanent, the implementation of it is temporary.
t1_dsurtbi	0	*	Which you'd likely do if it were your 20 dollars being stolen.
t1_dsva6xz	0	*	The hypocracy here is unbelievable. Now answer the question; do you think there is still a need for emergency emigration from Haiti, specifically due to the earthquake 8 years ago?
t1_dsuzj2q	1	*	You had a trade agreement that was kind of okay and pretty much worked for everyone? Nah, fuck that - A reckless idiot
t1_dsv00xx	1	*	I love how tea party republican darlings are now being outed. I hope that fucking stain rag racist shitball cotton gets slit up the center in the next election

t1_dsuu9j4	0	*	NPR for the first and Townsend and Sons for the second (which is a shame because he is so wholesome and enthusiastic and never wanted to be caught up in contemporary politics)   
t1_dsutx8b	1	*	> They don't have to adhere to safety rules or do a good job  This seems like the problem to me.
t1_dsv7hpe	1	*	Oh, I know. It's just that I made the mistake of looking those comments up and I wanted to warn people.
t1_dsv4iz9	1	*	What is it that means a lot to them?
t1_dsx28bj	0	*	Oh, look, another Trump supporter. So easy to spot them. 
t1_dsv3myn	0	*	Isreal has a few more problems than migrant workers, dude. 
t1_dsuui9u	0	*	That historian was a really nice guy too.
t1_dsuy5kw	0	*	Define contribute? And why bring over smart Norwegians only do you want them to steal our high paying jobs?  Keep trying to rationalize racism in sure history will look kindly on your view  
t1_dsuzv0v	0	*	Finally someone who remembers Norm, the greatest Fairly Odd Parents character. 
t1_dsux2y3	0	*	The first time I heard that publicly traded companies had a legal obligation to make a profit every year, I couldn't believe it. Nothing can grow forever.
t1_dsuuurg	1	*	Go make some immigrant friends and invite them over for dinner with your folks. Ive heard racism tends to wilt in the presence of real people. 
t1_dsusgfp	1	*	IIRC theres no legislation. Trump tells the DHS his policy initiatives and they execute them; raising the limit for H-2B workers was one of the policies they changed to align with Trumps direction.
t1_dsut6zz	0	*	The point is, if that's the problem being solved here, why is it no more low skill visas for Haiti and not just no more low skill visas?
t1_dsuzsbu	1	*	It was the declaration of independence not the constitution. 
t1_dsuvjva	0	*	Nope. Not what I said at all. You asked:  > Why not instead open it up to high skilled Haitains instead?  I told you why. A big portion of the H-1B program is specifically for filling low wage jobs. 
t1_dsv0gak	1	*	Don't underestimate the power of modern day voodoo with a pinch of hunger. /s
t1_dsuva1d	1	*	I highly doubt Jim Jones' followers knew much of anything about cults before finding this super amazing club.
t1_dsv95e2	0	*	But you are ignoring the number of people that percentage actually represents.  It's literally less than 10 people.
t1_dsuskj9	1	*	Wasnt legislated, it was done via Homeland Security and the Department of Labor last year.
t1_dsuxdrn	0	*	Making 60% more than minimum is a fantastic wage for a high school  kid. Hard work and honest pay is nothing to scoff at.
t1_dsvo914	0	*	> he left likes to treat groups differently based on their skin color  Yes, they acknowledge ongoing racial disparities and take corrective steps. 
t1_dsutf8n	0	*	> I don't even think we're on the same wavelength dude  Oh, no, we're definitely not. I don't give a good god damn about *the collective*.

t1_dsuunmt	0	*	wait are you under the impression that Kushner gets that money?
t1_dsvasgb	1	*	In a specific god.
t1_dsuuqfe	0	*	Because you nitpicked an in context colloquialism on an internet forum because it didn't fit a decidedly more accurate definition of the term? 
t1_dsut368	0	*	Needs at least 20 articles from NPR! NEXT!!!
t1_dsuy7pj	0	*	Holy shit you people are delusional 
t1_dswqn03	0	*	By that logic, guns aren't a problem since less than 1% are used in crimes. Should probably stop enforcing gun laws!

t1_dsvkf7g	1	*	Wouldn't that be you in this case?  Your reading comprehension is below that of a child's that you can't understand the headline of an article.
t1_dsux0vn	1	*	>  tweeted the constitution  It was the Declaration of Independence.  They were salty about them using elitist language and calling Trump an incompetent prince.  It was amazing.
t1_dsutk2r	0	*	Why are you (and everyone else) so upset of it does nothing?
t1_dsvddwz	0	*	while I am sure if I didn't block you, you would have much to teach me in my life...  Nah. cya.
t1_dsv8hks	1	*	Well there's not enough.You can't be missing the point here.. I do agree that the wages are ridiculous but as they are immigrants are needed to fill those jobs.
t1_dsvir09	0	*	It's not good at all right now. 
t1_dsv8vpb	0	*	Well there's something especially wrong with you when you believe bagging groceries warrants you a full $40k+ salary with benefits.
t1_dsuy7ix	1	*	Ding ding ding ding WINNER!

t1_dt64uzx	0	*	Thank you for the hate, shows how much you care <3. Keep fighting for misogyny in 2018!
t1_dt62yaj	0	*	Unless you can show me a story of women journalist being refused equal access as the men during the Obama administration you are not providing anything constructive here
t1_dt66kp6	1	*	Dude... The picture is of a woman literally standing with the reporters in the press pool. Did you not read the article? 
t1_dt65wyt	1	*	Questioning the absurdity of them is not the same as disrespecting them.
t1_dtszfve	0	*	Why is Naziism illegitimate? How do we determine that without free speech? How do we even have this conversation without free speech?
t1_dtsyd7b	0	*	Actions can obviously be illegal. But people here are explicitly advocating oppressing their SPEECH, not their actions. Theres a fundamental difference there.
t1_dswei0e	1	*	according to the original greek definition of barbarian, it just means not greek or not latin in rome. it can however have other meanings, but its not what i meant 
t1_dswhkfe	1	*	lol, it hasn't been defense in 70 years either.
t1_dswn29y	1	*	Yeah, thats my bad. I misread that. The CNN article was worded very poorly (not surprising) and made is sound like he had given testimony THEN was arrested for lying
t1_dsvpxdr	0	*	My point stands. Replace the word white with black and tell me if he would still be allowed anywhere near a university.
t1_dsvk8l8	0	*	You don't remember when Trump said a judge shouldn't be able to try a case because he had mexican heritage
t1_dsv5226	0	*	That's nice for you. You want a prize or something?
t1_dsv6ocw	0	*	Wait, you're serious about that bit? I thought you were just exaggerating.
t1_dswvu3q	0	*	Dude you lost, it's okay. 
t1_dsvs0up	1	*	Thank you
t1_dsws36z	0	*	Pay attention.  Slashing corporate tax rates buoys the stock market. This benefits the super-rich, not America at large. This doesn't MAGA. It's an irrelevant metric.  You're trying too soft. ;)
t1_dsx2rom	0	*	Lol at least I know what's going on 
t1_dsv8a2u	0	*	I still think our systems are quite different and that yours allows more weight on public votes.
t1_dsv0ea2	0	*	So you are just making it up?

t1_dsxysub	1	*	Wow kindergarden level of debate. Havent seen that in a long time.

t1_du18tiu	0	*	Well I'm pretty thankful you'll never really be in a position to tell anybody what to do. If people want to study gender studies, who gives a shit? Stop trying to control every one.
t1_du0vp1b	0	*	yeah that would be a valid argument if that wasn't but one of the mountains of evidence against chiropractic being effective
t1_du16j1e	1	*	For a hundred years in the US it was just an alternative medicine. The facts it's changing now is great but you get my point. 
t1_du17glq	0	*	since when is Wikipedia to be trusted?
t1_du23vk9	1	*	Let's start dumping ai chips in the ocean now and cure computerized mind control before it starts

t1_dsx64bv	0	*	And who did the massacres? Kurds...
t1_dsxvjvn	0	*	You seem to have gone back and edited your comment where you said civilians could cross the border.

t1_dsx2t6f	0	*	Turkey's war of independence from my understanding was more or less a defensive war against Armenia, Italy, France, Britain and Greece to stop their country from getting carved up.

t1_dsxnqth	1	*	Well two too many.

t1_dssqfgo	0	*	Giving people a sense of community, support, and purpose, what a shitty thing to do.
t1_dssj6s4	0	*	They are only repeated in reference to the old testament, though. It's really either valid or it's not. The new testament also has some pretty violent stuff in it itself, either way.

t1_dssjqio	0	*	and what's funny is I can't figure out what word would be better for this  Like his comparison for not being able to slaughter an animal; would you call that soft? 
t1_dssxfs6	0	*	No. But if we didn't arbitrarily cut up borders, displace people and destabilize governments it probably wouldn't be quite as bad as it is.  There's a middle ground where both can be somewhat true.
t1_dssnykk	0	*	what the actual fuck
t1_dst7762	1	*	If only the cartel would learn from ISIS, cartel killings I REALLY wanna see in HD
t1_dst0ifh	0	*	Youre kinda proving my point though. Both books contain acts of violence that god permits. If you let extremists control the religion then the message of peace gets dismissed.
t1_dsskkky	1	*	Says Muhammad....
t1_dssh66t	1	*	I have that URL memorized. You're not fooling me.
t1_dst1l8r	1	*	Can we just agree that  1 ISIS is pure evil,  2 It's probably less horrible to be lied to before you die unknowingly  than to be scared and forced into doing something before dying. 
t1_dsssa3g	1	*	It's almost as if anyone can cherry pick religious texts. 
t1_dsst94v	1	*	They turn them hollow 
t1_dsszox4	1	*	I would like to see that
t1_dssobp8	1	*	The lack of the reaction would be because they are already deeply traumatised and essentially living in a desensitised fight or flight mode. 
t1_dsspbeg	1	*	If theres no point to the Old Testament why is it included in every Christian bible?
t1_dssqil3	1	*	yeah true. it's fucked up imho.
t1_dsskyqi	1	*	I think we had the same initial reaction to reading that sentence, so I get where you were coming from. :)
t1_dssxkkm	0	*	I can throw this right back at you. What are the redeeming verses?
t1_dssph4y	0	*	Thank you.  I really needed that.
t1_dssij3k	0	*	Im just looking for clarification, are you suggesting the Bible was written all at once? 
t1_dssuhay	1	*	There it is. 
t1_dssmmyj	1	*	Same here, except I didn't make up excuses as to why I watched it. I was a stupid, curious teenager. 
t1_dssjoab	1	*	Nope, even Jesus teaches in parables
t1_dssxdep	1	*	Sure thing buddy. 
t1_dsslxxo	1	*	Thats what I was referring to as well. Id like to see the filters lifted and let the truth speak for itself. 
t1_dssy081	0	*	I'm 26, have been over there and have been watching my friends trying to deal with what we did and saw. It fucks everyone
t1_dssle0u	0	*	Yea true that.. thats so messed up
t1_dst023i	1	*	And the random way they assemble themselves. Branches sticking out in random directions at random places. Imagine if mammals grew like that. It'd be a horror story.
t1_dssv0gy	0	*	R/that happen d
t1_dssxktm	1	*	He wrote The Illuminatus Trilogy which riffs along Discordianist lines for a bit. I'm not aware of and CoS works of his but its possible.  Hail Eris ;)
t1_dssnjlv	1	*	Yeah. I think he meant total pansies.
t1_dssyfce	1	*	Of course not, he doesnt know what death is
t1_dsswvbs	0	*	Under saddam it wasn't great but it's nothing like the hell hole we have created over there. They def had thriving cities. 
t1_dst7vlt	1	*	It breaks my heart to acknowledge how right you are.
t1_dssy2o3	0	*	TIL: i dont have a coscience 
t1_dsshfw0	1	*	I hate you.  :-(
t1_dssmmbs	1	*	I can read the account of what happened. I already know what happened. I don't need to watch it to make a decision, in this case the decision being that it's a horrible thing.
t1_dssma7v	0	*	Enough to turn them into barbaric fucks.
t1_dssndrt	0	*	Jesus what the fuck
t1_dst9oc0	0	*	Dude, it's half.   That's like saying kiddy-diddling has gone down, it's great and I'm saying dude, half of that group kiddy-diddles, it's not good at all
t1_dssvn9d	1	*	I won't watch it, thanks.
t1_dst2dow	1	*	It also said he had babies impaled...
t1_dssko9d	1	*	So is the money a certain few men are making off of all these wars and deaths and misery. 
t1_dssmsa4	0	*	This sounds like Machiavelli on a meth bender.
t1_dsslhu7	1	*	Yea I forgot about that ,they showed it in we were solodiers too I think
t1_dssxkm6	0	*	But youre trying to attribute one evil as worse - how are you doing this even? 
t1_dssmjkx	1	*	Im gathering it was funky town. That song will bring back memories now... what some people can do to other people is staggering. 
t1_dsw6hjs	0	*	Your number for albuquerque is in habitants per square mile, not km ;)
t1_dsxg7u6	1	*	That's really interesting. So that's a little over $45k. Most low income housing in the United States require you to be below half of that.
t1_dsvwkjv	1	*	Lol
t1_dsw4uae	1	*	Hi I've lived in Chicago for 4 years with no car
t1_dsw2rba	0	*	Because it isnt legit, and lots of people have been able to start their own businesses.  If someone can not get a job then what are they doing to get money?
t1_dswaml8	0	*	I only pay $900 For a 3 bedroom and garage in Philadelphia 
t1_dsvnw8i	0	*	cool I'm an electrical engineer that programmed in java for 3 years, I can teach yall STEM or code some java any day of the week~
t1_dt4eevm	1	*	I'm sorry for the assumption then.  My point still stands. 
t1_dt5ezub	0	*	It's a tu quoque logical fallacy of the red herring variant. It really is meta that you whataboutted whataboutism 
t1_dt3zuvr	0	*	Obviously what you think is very important.
t1_dt3yz7f	0	*	Let's wait and see. If you can persuade your democratic government to stop trading with China, I will be very pleased.
t1_dt3z33s	0	*	obviously, it's the rule here. When in Rome, do what romans do. 
t1_dt4m5rs	1	*	That is definitely what they'll do, at least if Hong Kong is any indication  
t1_dt4ttxv	1	*	Depends on the tea. A pu er round brick cost about 250$ and it's maybe 8 in in diameter and 1 in in height in California.
t1_dt4ud1o	0	*	but its not there to project global power.
t1_duwudw9	1	*	You crazy, baby! Usually a few sentences is all Im willing to read from someone without source(s). 
t1_dv0eyxu	0	*	No need to introduce the law then.
t1_dv47imz	1	*	> The wording of the Law is vague  And exactly that is the problem.
t1_dtgazpe	0	*	I intend to break the cycle.
t1_dtg975u	0	*	Future you, usually. 
t1_dtg9qrv	0	*	I feel like it means part time... Not sure though.
t1_dtghbv3	1	*	But most cases not before their parents die, by which time the children will be in their 40s or 50s. Also assuming the parents don't spaff it all since it is their retirement fund
t1_dtg8utl	0	*	I think Europe is mature enough not to go into another world war simply because of an economic and quasi political bloc. 
t1_dti3hrm	1	*	The advocado toast argument was specifically having it for breakfast so if you only ate it for breakfast and stopped and saved that money it would take you 51 years to save for your deposit
t1_dtgdykh	1	*	German, too.
t1_dtgiush	1	*	It's worse for Australia since their whole culture is centered around owning a house. 
t1_dtgdytj	1	*	Wait 14 dollars? An avocado is like 2-3 dollars max and toast even less? The hell? Then again blt ingredients are pretty cheap.
t1_dtgh4rz	1	*	Yes, but not compulsory.
t1_dtg7fce	1	*	Logged in to upvote.  And I found something *very funny indeed* in the thread I was reading before this but cbf logging in.
t1_dtg1vr3	1	*	Please see video in edited comment
t1_dtg3jmy	0	*	You didn't have a comparable law? 
t1_dthg7z1	1	*	I doubt trade deals would come into effect until Britain officially leaves the EU. 
t1_dth007b	1	*	Pero xbfpor quxe9 no los dos paxedses quxe9? Desarrolla la pregunta.
t1_dtgec8m	0	*	You'd need to formalize it with some sort of treaty, though.
t1_dtgb2ht	0	*	Unless you work in NY City or MAYBE SF, I don't believe you.
t1_dtg85dp	1	*	Not OP but I am after 8 years of 12 hour shifts at a blue collar job and the blessed crypto known as ethereum.
t1_dtg7jdv	0	*	That's impressive, but is it matched against inflation? 13,980 pounds aren't going to be worth as much as they were in 1980.
t1_dthog1h	1	*	They have plans for people that don't make much money that can extend your loan repayment based on income and it can go out to 30 years now.
t1_dtgfka5	1	*	Comments peaked with this one, they can only go downhill from here.
t1_dtg9odk	0	*	whoa what the FUCK. 14 dollars for avocado toast? I'm ok with being a little price gouged on an avocado because places have to make money, but 14 dollars for an avocado and bread?!
t1_dtgpipc	1	*	Still less wasted votes in the Canadian system, but first past there post needs to die.
t1_dtgbdzr	1	*	That too. 
t1_dtg5mqa	0	*	Case in point.  You think that foreign countries had a high opinion of the USA two years ago, sorry, that's fake news bud.
t1_dtgb4ml	0	*	We can assume he's not an English major 
t1_dtg6axl	0	*	Yeah, it made her do right wing things like vote for the Iraq war.
t1_dtg2t53	1	*	And the coast has issues those regions wouldn't understand.  That is why each state has senators to argue for their state's in Congress.
t1_dtg8409	1	*	Well spoken and thoughtful words there.   EDIT: unfortunate that you edited your comment. I like it less now. Please bring back the swear words. 
t1_dtgaymh	1	*	You forgot to factor in the upcoming price surge on avocados.as mexico begins paying for the wall.
t1_dtg0ua4	1	*	What is with simply trying to comprehend the explaination and follow it with reading the paper your own?  You now actually fall for the typical authority bias... 
t1_dtg8p02	0	*	That wasn't a claim made by Farage.  It was a Vote Leave campaign claim made by Gove and Johnson.
t1_dtgd3ul	1	*	Plant 2 trees, house free.
t1_dtga0wj	0	*	Canada reporting in; homeownership seems like a distant and abstract dream.
t1_dtgaluw	0	*	Yep
t1_dtg9hi1	0	*	Yeah, and not of all rest of Scotland is a city... 
t1_dtg2bly	0	*	No, thats how it was for senators.    It changed right about the turn of hw 20th century to the popular election it is today.
t1_dtg2bey	0	*	Obamacare was indeed a Republican bill long before Obama got ahold of it.
t1_dtgx0le	0	*	[Not necessarily the only way to get it done.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Popular_Vote_Interstate_Compact)
t1_dtgcn1a	0	*	It's a thing wherever people assume that a house should always be a profitable investment.
t1_dtg6rnw	0	*	Thats assuming the housing market wont continue to skyrocket. 
t1_dtgpub3	1	*	It's a good point that there is hypocrisy on each side. 
t1_dtg9011	1	*	17 years? That there home will run about 2.6 mil by then. Gonna need to cut out all your other frivolous spending as well there champ. 
t1_dtgpytn	0	*	Well, statistically I'm not sure if it was ever the norm to be a home owner. I'm not saying it's easy or that it's the norm but it IS do-able.
t1_dtg66ap	1	*	The student, through taxes after getting a job. Thats how it works here.
t1_dthh0o3	1	*	It's more of a problem for the right. Yes, everyone has degrees of tribalism, but clearly progressivism has very little to do with tribalism, whereas most reactionary policies do.
t1_dtglbb6	1	*	$14 for Avocado on fucking Toast !!?  What a ripoff !
t1_dtgjoih	0	*	Thanks! I'm a Spanish teacher and love grammar, so I found this very interesting.
t1_dtgje3q	1	*	Seeing as liberals are the majority, there can't really be liberal brigades
t1_dthbvlb	0	*	Fascinating... I hadn't heard of this. I wonder when this will be a problem that the gov actually talks about
t1_dtgrdpv	1	*	This is key. Colonial economics were the economics of the upper classes. 
t1_dtgt8ky	1	*	Germany saying hi: We're doing the same thing.
t1_dtgq0ec	1	*	$14 for one piece of toast with avacado on it? wtf hipsters...
t1_dtfxeyb	0	*	A passive aggressive personal attack if you will. That is undeniable.
t1_dtgai2y	0	*	Wtf. You make 200k a year. Why are you even complaining? 
t1_dtg4v49	1	*	Nice straw man.
t1_dtgccvb	1	*	What are you even talking about? In SF you buy your own avocados for a dollar apiece and make your own fucking toast. And the home prices are well over $1.3m...
t1_dtg1te3	0	*	Agreed. There is liberal media, but ironically it doesn't tend to be the mainstream media. Msnbc is the closest, but even then it's not as left as fox is right. 
t1_dtgf135	1	*	 *buys house votes for draconian zoning laws to make it prohibitively expensive to build more houses. 
t1_dtgm9sf	1	*	Kicked out, as-in various types of visas were eliminated, ensuring people like me had to leave.  I never overstayed a visa or anything.  
t1_dtgfsuf	0	*	It is their fault that they vote for people that refuse to raise our wages and generally want to fuck us over. 
t1_dtg1yjf	0	*	Except the minority have *more* say. Trump lost. Between Trump, Hillary, and not voting, Trump came 3rd.
t1_dtgges1	0	*	The biggest stock market crash since 1929 caused a global financial catastrophe, leading to millions of people losing their jobs every month for about a year.  This crisis began in 2008.
t1_dth7j51	0	*	So what's the problem with making our electoral system *even more* representative? Our current system is completely broken. 
t1_dtg9b5m	0	*	Feels.
t1_dtg7enr	0	*	I'm glad we're all agreed that you have no arguments. 
t1_dtg9wb1	1	*	Kind of like part time. No set hours per week. No holidays, or holiday pay. Generally less benefits, but higher hourly wage to make up for loss of holiday pay, sick leave and other benefits.
t1_dthcwas	0	*	>Yours came with an autism detector?! Now I'm jealous  I don't need one when reading your posts. It's obvious as it is. 
t1_dtgfurf	1	*	What did you edit? what are you hiding? 
t1_dtg6b2k	0	*	Clinton could have stopped the removal of it , but did not . The 90' s is where america was ultimately sold out. 
t1_dtggbu1	0	*	Republicans control Congress.....
t1_dtgkdpn	1	*	Ah fair enough. I guess I don't do shady shit like that and making my life harder to get some benefits. So didn't think of that.
t1_dtgby77	1	*	I found later that this is wrong, but my HS teacher taught us that we were Spanish, the word Spaniard wasn't even heard. 
t1_dtg3nrk	0	*	On the other hand, I don't mind the fact that people don't vote when they're so uninformed that they don't even bother to vote.
t1_dthh3vn	1	*	Largest voting generation, yes. That's because Gen X is small, and baby boomers are dying.
t1_dtgnasw	1	*	Exactly.  I'm sure someone will be along to call you a liar. but you are exactly right.
t1_dth703j	1	*	Definitely not.  I don't know why you would think I would think that. 
t1_dtg5s4f	0	*	Who is making assumptions?
t1_dtg6pr1	0	*	I think the hippie movement is overstated. Today, we identify it with that whole generation, but really, it was a just a *sub*culture and the majority of boomers weren't involved.
t1_dtg6grb	0	*	Ok buddy. 
t1_dtgl34v	1	*	welcome to the UK!
t1_dtg7355	1	*	Which is exactly the thing that causes millions of votes to not matter.
t1_dtgcrjx	0	*	Pouring water on water makes water. I'm really not trolling. Wet is an adjective or verb. I thought the same thing you did at one point. 
t1_dtg7qts	0	*	Assuming you supplement those meals with tasty nutritious air before you hop in the old job cannon. 
t1_dtgzka8	1	*	Actually, it wasn't socialist. It wasn't running the country for the people, it was the merging of corporations and the state. There's a significant difference between the two.
t1_dtg3tma	0	*	pithy and myopic.  ITT: the same deluded fools that populate the majority of voting rolls.
t1_dtg7t1f	1	*	Jobs are not zero sum, the demand for labor is a function of supply. 
t1_dtgeu9y	1	*	yeah, but that would mean Trump runs again in like 2028...
t1_dtga7tb	1	*	But Jesus
t1_dtgc543	1	*	Yep. That's stupid. 
t1_dtg3tdt	1	*	There are still Senators that are advocates for their states.  All the electoral college does is makes some American's votes count less than others.
t1_dtgew2n	1	*	Same thing here in South Korea
t1_dtgchx3	1	*	Relevant because that was Bill hicks complaining about the old guard like were complaining about the boomers in this thread. 
t1_dtgetk0	1	*	This would be like Trump running again in 2024
t1_dtgj9fn	1	*	It's the only way
t1_dtfwc07	0	*	All articles are based on the very same Index you send me before and I react to (gfci z/yen). Appeal to authority doesn't make the biased index less corrupted.
t1_dtg8jec	0	*	Yes. I made an account last weekend because I anticipated seeing his comment today.   I see the future. 
t1_dtfsdj5	0	*	If it's Nonbinding.  Then you hold a second Binding resolution.   Like, they do with just about every resolution, ever, except for this one. This one time, for some reason. 
t1_dtgtsm3	0	*	Thats totally fair. Im thinking of just having dogs instead of human children. 
t1_dtggvnn	0	*	Millenials are not teenagers anymore. Youngerst are 20+ but cna confirm we already hate the younger generation with their dabbing and fleet eye brows. 
t1_dtg3w6v	0	*	Going by your definition, England hasn't been a country for over 300 years.
t1_dtg6rtc	0	*	You'll see the same in any government.  For example, the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the UK will have far more input and responsibility than a backbench MP. 
t1_dthys69	0	*	So that I can become an absolutely miserable, snarky, arrogant, middle-aged twat with an exceedingly thin grasp on reality like you?  No thanks, I think I'll enjoy my ungrateful youth. 
t1_dtgpafh	1	*	That's so American of them
t1_dtgbodf	1	*	This is always where my mind goes too. If education encouraged critical thinking and logical reasoning (at least more effectively), more of the voters would be voting based on policy. 
t1_dtg8yp2	1	*	I just came back from Sydney and could find decent avo toast for $6 aud 
t1_dtgf3im	0	*	Why would anyone trust the US with a new trade deal if they just ripped up the old ones?
t1_dtgesvv	1	*	Your comment is right on the money.  Trump was a comfortable old face that the writers could make work.
t1_dtg7717	0	*	!redditsilver
t1_dtg4pog	1	*	>Forgetting that WTO rules are a thing.  The article referenced above specifically mentions this scenario and it's not a ZERO international trade.  Did you even read the article?
t1_dtg4igb	0	*	That's kind of the problem, yes
t1_dtghpsv	1	*	I suppose doesn't mattter wasn't woorded right, but my point was that the actual policies and actions one takes as president in terms of leading adminstratively is more important then the perception 
t1_dtg10rb	1	*	My money is worth a quarter less than it was before the referendum. How the fuck is that not feeling it?
t1_dthwmjp	1	*	Just pus :s

t1_dtm38w1	0	*	Im surprised I have to clarify this. Its what he is called in Guardians of the Galaxy.
t1_dtm2hkn	1	*	A group of 4 of us took turns, 2 on 2 watch.  I guess i mumbled to a mini-fridge for the majority of it.
t1_dtm3bo2	0	*	Look I believe they freeze people, I'm not saying they are dumping bodies in landfill, I'm saying that anyone who believes they are coming back from that is delusional.
t1_dtmufn1	0	*	Nobody thinks that people starving is okay, nor does anybody think that capitalism is a perfect system. It isn't.  However, it's significantly better than all of the alternatives we've tried. 
t1_dten2o0	0	*	> you lot  Hateful bigot. The rainbow-flag waving allegory to the Swastika cannot be missed.  You wish death on those who oppose your fascist ideology. 
t1_dtu6fnf	1	*	nice! i'll check that out

t1_dttvi9a	0	*	How do you get that? I feel bad for the commenter you're addressing, theyve had to explain things that were so easy to read, but somehow people arent getting it
t1_dtu21te	0	*	From a biological perspective, no organism really has the right to live. The catch is that this includes humans. We're the same as the rest of them, we just lucked out with our evolutionary pathway.
t1_dttz01h	0	*	I know the wiki. I was hoping you had the actual story. You still haven't said what the scenario is that you were referring to. 
t1_dtuiune	1	*	dude im sorry but corporations are capitalist lol
t1_dttx7lf	0	*	Why is it so difficult for you people to say your opinions without being jerks? Is this how you talk to your friends and family? Or coworkers?

t1_dufnw5s	0	*	inducing and including don't mean anything near the same.
t1_dug161r	1	*	Stop deflecting. You're the one who wanted a fucking discussion, not a game of dodgeball. Should non-medically-necessary circumcision be banned or not? Yes or no?

t1_dsrokpf	0	*	Well your interacting with people who are. So in an inadvertent way you are. So if you want people to support those values than maybe don't act like they are bullshit.
t1_dsjsgw1	1	*	Yeah, that wasn't the angle I was shooting. What meddling has the US done to france I guess is the question I'm propping.
t1_dsindjz	1	*	Thanks for your insight and constructive feedback. On this blessed day we are all antiintellectuals. :)
t1_dsilrpt	1	*	What a stunningly beautiful retort.
t1_dsihfmc	0	*	You missed the point of my post entirely.  Youre putting out a baseless claim that one is worse than the other. Thats not being objective, thats being opinionated. 
t1_dsiuutf	0	*	If I had been right and you were wrong, would the difference in amount we can prove the Russians spent in an attempt to illegally influence our elections affect your opinion?
t1_dsipelr	1	*	Whoops.  It probably gets shared because David Wolfe shared/posted it.
t1_dsit11o	1	*	Other than your assertion that they were making an argument. Or was that just mind dribble, flowing out onto your keyboard? 
t1_dsij8ge	1	*	Ok, i will.   Thank you
t1_dsjdilj	1	*	Blue states tend to have pretty good public education. Red states tend to be pretty awful due to having less state funding
t1_dubkmmf	1	*	Sweet, you understand how currency works!
t1_dubik1j	0	*	So, am I still a child?  Did you go onto TOR or check any of the Darknet subs and see what currency they take?
t1_dubl8rl	1	*	That's what the assholes told me 5 years ago...
t1_dtj8t0u	0	*	This is known as indoctrination.
t1_dt2y2sh	1	*	You can say that about every std, you think spreading every std should be a felony?
t1_dsa7ado	0	*	How did he shit on it?
t1_dsa7okw	1	*	Of course I can believe that he heard something he can't explain, that's a completely pointless observation.  His connection of unknown sounds to Bigfoot is what I take issue with.
t1_dsa841l	1	*	Damn it... Beat me to it... Well Played, Well Played.
t1_dsa1qli	0	*	I'll listen to Les Stroud over a guy who faked a TV show.
t1_dsacy3f	0	*	It's not clear that insects have that ability. They have a central nervous system that's somewhat different from humans and other animals. Also see: https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/tu-quoque
t1_dsa95wu	1	*	Very very stupid. 
t1_ds9ywjp	1	*	I just got sucked down a Bushcraft wormhole on YouTube recently. It's not exactly survival but it's super interesting none the less.
t1_dsaabf7	0	*	Every time someone regurgitates this shitty meme implying he'll die before finishing the series I wanna puke.   It's so fucking tired, it's like reading a 40 year old's Facebook comment feed.
t1_dsac854	1	*	limpets are shellfish.  
t1_dsa6ce9	1	*	Yes.  It also affects hop utilization in beer because of the lower boiling temp 
t1_ds9yzw9	0	*	No they're not trying to live on the island they are trying to compete for a tv show. 
t1_dsa3nbd	0	*	Trust me if I never eat meat again no less animals will be killed. The amount we waste already is testament to that. 
t1_dsaq6dr	0	*	In that case, use this point on someone else who actually argued that killing just for fun is worthwhile.
t1_dsa55pp	0	*	The conclusion that can be drawn from I dont know what this is. Is I don't know what this is, not this is definitely bigfoot.
t1_dsa6nli	0	*	Asking about a reference is shitting on it?
t1_dsa7gtg	0	*	Why will they starve to death because they're male? They would just die of old age.

t1_dsa5490	0	*	Yeah that's kinda part of the joke for me!
t1_dsa6hid	0	*	It's enough to *assume* so, but it's still a valid question.
t1_dsa27xz	1	*	Yea if anyone is using any reality tv as an actual survival instructional video they would probably get themselves killed.
t1_ds9x1zs	0	*	Oh man, wonder if they get a bonus reward
t1_dsa9jhj	1	*	limpets are molluscs. And yes, fungi arent animals, obviously.
t1_dsacruf	0	*	When did I say I did that? [Also that's a logical fallacy](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/tu-quoque).
t1_ds9ywbg	0	*	Which if were being honest is usually also staged.
t1_dsa5bah	0	*	Cool man, great answer. Be a hater because they decided that sitting in front of a fire for 45 minutes isnt entertaining TV. 
t1_dsa53fl	1	*	You wish.
t1_dsacjp2	1	*	The type that causes heart disease and colon cancer I would guess.
t1_dsaef0p	0	*	I thought the same thing, then I tried giving it up for a month and I didn't miss it.  A long time since and I still don't. 
t1_ds9y52u	1	*	You are right, on its own. I assumed the hypocrisy charge - in this case - was meant as an invitation to disregard his criticism of Bear. 
t1_dsacc98	1	*	Not if there are no other options.
t1_dsawc4r	1	*	As there is also no law to prevent adults believing in skyman, Santa, or any other mythical beasts.
t1_dsa83lc	1	*	Living here affects a lot. Granted I'm only around 5 to 6 thousand feet daily, and not in the mountains, but baking is especially affected. Many a flat muffin have been made lol 
t1_dsa5d9d	1	*	We got a badass here, can't go vegan because he gets into too many survival situations on a regular basis.
t1_ds9yc9l	0	*	There are no Canadian celebs...  ;)
t1_dsijc7l	0	*	It's still not sensationalized. 
t1_dtuo5rc	1	*	> You cant go to Walmart with Bitcoin.  Not relevant to what I said. Going to Walmart isn't the qualifying definition of a currency, 
t1_dtdpfw4	0	*	I'm sure there are some that truly believe a rising tide raises all boats but they are few and not very smart. 
t1_dtmyy7l	0	*	I think this a fair enough point for us to end on.

t1_duaaw7p	1	*	I agree. 
t1_dubg34r	1	*	lol i know. Its just hard when it feels like reddits a weird mash up of personal conversations and professional opinions, with a huge grey line splayed down the middle.

t1_duad03f	0	*	Are we doing pointless article game?  Here's a fun one https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2018/02/14/kangaroos-nashville-zoo-celebrate-valentines-day/338774002/
t1_duannpn	1	*	Family guy had an episode with that in it.
t1_dua8gec	0	*	You can't even link me to a decent source of them then? Not trying to be funny or anything, just wanted to read something from the other side. 
t1_duacgpn	1	*	I mean, he probably thinks he's doing pretty good work. He's already got the best words...and the biggest hands. Now, he's the best precedent in the most unpresidented ways.
t1_duabsd4	0	*	That's literally the reason they don't have the right to vote
t1_duacbtp	0	*	Let's just grant forever more extensions, not unlike the current US annual budget.

t1_duak603	0	*	i don't deny it at all  at least they may be able to do something with their buyer remorse if brexit can't be indefinitely delayed or reversed
t1_dudhlvr	0	*	You could have asked me what my username refers to rather than make assumptions.
t1_dub6ekk	0	*	It wasn't overturned yet. Its nonsense to expect anyone to pretend something is illegal when it isn't.   But apparently ignoring reality is your whole thing. 
t1_duat2n9	1	*	Damn man you're wrecking these clowns XD.
t1_duabzk5	1	*	Considering people have actually heard of Scotland, probably not quite equal
t1_due6czv	1	*	How much do you know about Ethereum contracts?
t1_dua4slu	0	*	Do you think we should redo the referendum? or just scrap brexit because some people that was to young to vote would vote remain?
t1_dub5ix2	0	*	There will be no second referendum. Britain is leaving the EU. It is time you start living in the real world and accept that is going to happen.
t1_dua5vol	1	*	I was hoping nobody would ask :)
t1_dua8097	1	*	>nefarious and undemocratic organisation  Dont be ridiculous. It's more democratic than the UK is. 
t1_ducexo9	0	*	Again, if you think Trump is to praise for this - you know nothing about your own economy.

t1_duj83k3	1	*	More reliable than the pound, mate. Have fun with it devaluing even more.
t1_duaeuiw	0	*	The Nazis were socialist leftists. Their love of socialized government, love of animal rights to an absurd level, and hatred of the Jews is evidenced by it.  
t1_duaetct	1	*	You are aware that Trump took office at Jan 20 2017, right?
t1_dubmmbp	0	*	According to this new poll, which is more accurate and scientific than an actual vote....  Listen to yourself. 
t1_duags2x	0	*	Yeah, people keep forgetting employment was at 10% and GDP growth was at 0% till Trump won the election.
t1_duaawfn	0	*	Right up until November 2016, I was one of the deniers.
t1_duafifw	0	*	Then we forcibly open their borders and by extension their society, and, whatever discontent they might have will be gone after in a generation of living in a multicultural society. 
t1_dua9khj	0	*	It's psychology.   Why do you assume I'm making excuses for brexit?
t1_dudzqf7	1	*	But the one you buy in Japan is not made in Bulgaria either. At least if you make it yourself you know what's inside.
t1_dua9rpc	0	*	Germany isn't using eastern European labour to avoid innovating.    UK business are.
t1_ds39lmj	0	*	I mean the other side has its fair share of pseudoscience. This is the problem these two extremes are just flinging shit against each other
t1_ds3kyt9	1	*	I mean he was right
t1_ds3ctfc	0	*	Uniformity gives us strength
t1_duzjkxd	1	*	They won't. They'll use government to regulate competition away. It's not a swear word, it's more than welcome.
t1_duzdksp	0	*	The people who control the government, without exception, are corrupt. Therefore the government is, even if most government employees are not.
t1_dstz0r0	1	*	All your links still establish the main contributors to the change was the language differences and the Fuedal / class system, which is also what the OP said 
t1_dstrkc1	1	*	Manned by settled Normans, who also helped create Middle English and the other 4000 that came with William shortly after 1066
t1_dv1b28u	0	*	Demanding luxury is a weird debate stance.   
t1_dstub6d	0	*	This is the claim I was making from the beginning of the conversation that YOU tried to refute. If it's been established for a million years than why did you question it when I first made the claim?
t1_durr1ik	0	*	Sure. Any board he was not already on or considered for is probably not going to change their mind.
t1_dur8fdh	0	*	U/Alavapulsar just said the trick was to find balance between the two.... not that either one was okay
t1_dur2ao7	0	*	Then you are simply to dumb or ignorant to get it. But that's okay buddy. Keep on living your simple life.
t1_duqsbs4	1	*	Its ridiculous that we even have to deal with the fact that another country has its citizens being paid by their government (or ours) to troll like this on political forums. 
t1_dur6vub	0	*	Melania is a person, not Air Force One.
t1_dus3ngg	0	*	You first claim conservatives reject reality, but you have no problem with them? You are confused, my friend.

t1_durqcoy	0	*	In a direct democracy, the rural would never get a vote. In our Republic, they sometimes win. Seems fair to me.
t1_dur87kl	1	*	Because area's don't dictate shit.  Dirt doesn't get a vote. People do.
t1_dsup0wv	0	*	The issue is that you don't have any obvious knowledge of government travel or the regulations surrounding it.
t1_dsvsgep	0	*	It is still an ill representation of the growth we have had.   It's like me using this graph  https://i.redd.it/iud9v0wd7ta01.jpg
t1_dsuzc1c	0	*	Typical the_donald poster. Gets sources, runs away. Bye fam.
t1_dswev44	0	*	That was my point.  Why would we not want him to use something we are already paying for?  I dont understand how his supporters think that is ok, never mind the blatant corruption in paying himself.  
t1_dsvw61r	0	*	Most of those are:   1. Irrelevant like ISIS  2. Not down to Trump, like economic growth.
t1_dsvi8k1	1	*	You can enter the country without a visa, you just need a passport.
t1_dtq8fn9	0	*	my original comment was not about trump
t1_dtczivw	0	*	I'm not even going to bother telling you how ignorant you sound because it's going to take too long. Go read what you wrote and try to learn what not to say. 
t1_dtdl4l1	0	*	or maybe your just being a doche
t1_dtdrgtu	0	*	They got nuclear weapons tech from Pakistan in the late 90s  Maybe you should do some research
t1_dtdp2wr	0	*	>As for the had no choice,  still the Japan attacked first, not the other way around.  Blocade is an act of war.
t1_dtdrnqo	0	*	revisionist;  i wouldn't be surprised if you were also a holocaust denier.
t1_dtdcnjn	0	*	But if they aren't a nuclear power then they are no longer acting as a buffer.  Also, what specifically do you expect Trump to say or do to make this fantasy a reality? 
t1_dtcoihd	1	*	Nah fam.
t1_dte05fy	1	*	That is still acknowledging the original accusation though, that's why it's not whataboutism. 
t1_dtcyjtd	0	*	I like how Americans and Russians discuss  whos country is better, but in reality for rest of the world they are same assholes. 
t1_dv2msmk	0	*	Wow nice deflection, a circumcision is totally comparable to abortion, yep!  Anyway a fetus isn't a child, simple as that. 
t1_dstkjvt	1	*	It's sad the office of the President has been tarnished like this. I hope it all get's sorted out and we can elect people with integrity in the future.
t1_dstbp45	0	*	yes I'm a tool for telling someone they wrote something that's unreadable because of grammatical mistakes. and you're a random person that doesn't know what the fuck they're talking about.
t1_dstbmna	1	*	Nah I liked it 
t1_dstiw77	1	*	Interesting. Thanks for sharing that!
t1_dsts714	0	*	Wow, I love seeing the level of engagement. Do you get exhausted dealing with all the messages?
t1_dsteaau	1	*	Half is a serious overstatement. 
t1_dstlzhc	1	*	The lead-up to the actual reveals were so fucking satisfying.   *hint drops, change of tone*   Oh... Oh, oh OH SHIT, really? No, but...   *REVEAL*   WHOA HOLY SHIT   I love Westworld. 
t1_dst6e0o	0	*	Right? English is easily one of the easiest languages to learn. It's just that all languages are hard. 
t1_dstizdz	0	*	Interesting information, thank you.  Are people switching from GOP to Democrat? Or is support growing for independents, greens etc also?
t1_dstyizh	1	*	Stephen Colbert famously hosted the correspondents dinner during Bush where he said Reality has a well-known liberal bias. 
t1_dstkuvs	0	*	Only people forgetting this are Trump supporters and they're willfully ignorant on the matter.  If it doesn't fit the narrative Fox n Trump are pushing its fake news and they simply forget.
t1_dsu5h3j	1	*	Thanks for the link!  Ha, back at ya :-)
t1_dstb6rm	1	*	It's robots all the way down! 
t1_dst95xr	1	*	Hahaha I know, I do the same with the ds and ts in Dutch grammar, which works to an extent!

t1_dstb6vu	1	*	If you aint Cav...  Youve probably never fucked a horse.
t1_dsudaa4	1	*	Because the economy and jobs and deep state
t1_dst6k9q	1	*	To go a little further: When? Then. What? That. ;)
t1_dstrox4	0	*	Interesting. Do you think Mueller will ask about Comey's investigation or is that outside the scope of the subpoena? 
t1_dstg92u	0	*	I thought the superdelegates had to vote in line with the returned result: Do they have the means to return a vote that is different to the in-state popular vote? 
t1_dstdde9	1	*	I thought the statistics showed 1/4 of people were mentally disabled though not half
t1_dstmyuh	1	*	At least a few of us see its not one side or the other that's fucked. It is the government as a whole. Maybe different side but it is on the same dollar bill
t1_dstb1sy	1	*	And a lot of people say it in earnest. It's not really a joke, though it is humorous.
t1_dstsyl8	0	*	That's the equivalent of saying not a loser, not a loser, you're a loser. I don't nor have I ever lived with parents since becoming an adult. Sorry. Bye then, you bore me.
t1_dsteyge	0	*	This is Reddit. We all get off on petty grammar and punctuation errors.
t1_dstpcng	0	*	This is like riding in a crashing airplane and having someone say   This has been going on since we were 10,000ft higher up. Not only will this plane land it will be the bestest landing of all time.
t1_dspfxr8	0	*	Those 1000 people broke the law, and they knew they did. Being young doens't ecxuse you from following the law. Is it a problem if we arrest a 19 year old who stole a car? 
t1_dsplwak	0	*	Good, please don't ever have any children. 
t1_dspj3am	1	*	> Why are they minors if they are at age of consent.  Because that's the law.
t1_dspiq0d	1	*	Because they are minors and don't have the same rights as adults.  They can't buy booze, can't sign contracts, can't enlist in the military, etc.  
t1_dspip2h	1	*	And the girl's life of being stalked and harassed when pervs watch that video are of no consequence.  No.  
t1_dspfqxs	0	*	You're missing the point, they're minors. Molestors prey on pre-pubescent and pubescent teens. I'm sure you're aware of that but decided to ignore it for that handy appeal to the dictionary definition
t1_dspkgio	0	*	What a pathetic undemocratic attitude.  No law should ever be above questioning. They are made by the people for the people.
t1_dspit9z	1	*	Your problem is YOU  don't want to get busted when YOU share such videos.  
t1_dspfz0u	0	*	Ruining teens lives by circulating child pornographic material of them is fine tho.
t1_dspjw8u	1	*	You mean the 1000 kids who knowingly distributed child porn? They are not innocent here at all. They hurt their own lives. Get over it.

t1_dv2zxqc	0	*	Wake up, sheeple... Thats what his conspirators want you to think. 
t1_dtitrp2	1	*	Can confirm. This is basically my experience working in that setting. Also not for the government.  Basically people never age past 6. 
t1_dtiqhhd	1	*	And some people have never done business with China...
t1_dtj0bdo	1	*	That's fine with me. As long as we raise the minimum wage and lower the definition of full time workers to compensate for the massive effects that would cause
t1_dtl5hnk	0	*	You are forgetting about canada and the world's longest unprotected border. 
t1_ds5hfif	1	*	It was exaggeration, the Hebrews left Egypt in 1446 BC so some undetermined time before 3,464 years ago.

t1_dsysgln	0	*	Turkey closes down the strait for Russian commercial shipping and you'll have nukes flying in the air hours later.  They've said this time and time again. 
t1_dsyft7q	1	*	Which if you have a navy stuck in the Black Sea you kinda need to go through Turkey to get into the Mediterranean.

t1_dt719ez	1	*	Everything floats down here
t1_dt76ipp	0	*	I love that you're justifying this.  Do you know what kicked off the war of independence down south of us? A much, much lower levy on a much smaller form of good.  Pathetic.
t1_dt6wxmn	0	*	See over 900. XD
t1_dt6x3gn	0	*	And it's A4 paper, which is bigger than 8.5x11.
t1_dt6zwsx	0	*	Wait...is Italy part of the EU?  Could I open a corporation in Italy and through crafty accounting get paid?
t1_dt72mh1	1	*	Come one man, use your brain a little. It's the rich that would set regulations on that AI, to increase the barrier of entry . 
t1_dt6zqh2	1	*	Its not though by any metric, you were trying to be cute about it but got caught with your pants down, is ok happens to the best of us.

t1_dt7h1b0	1	*	Ok so like 3x more than I expected. 
t1_dt743wo	0	*	I'm doing my best to give that blowhard an argument, but it's really hard to come up with something that makes him look like he knows what he's talking about. 
t1_dt7o9lu	0	*	That's why nobody cares what you think.
t1_dt70by4	1	*	Dude I think you need to re-read what I've said to you and check yourself.
t1_dt711f6	1	*	No, but the confidence that he would drop taxes and create more loopholes for the rich and corporations spurred growth in the stock market.  
t1_dt83uw7	1	*	Oh ok, that makes sense, property taxes are slightly more sane down that way
t1_dt88542	1	*	It's dependent by province, and some have stipulations. In ONT where I live part time they will relieve it but you have to stay in the province for 5 years.
t1_dt706z7	1	*	But most of the people over seas dont count as being employed in another country. 
t1_dt6zc69	0	*	Haha they sure are, and I can guarantee any profit long ago made from this phone I'm using solely fed shareholder dividends. 
t1_dt7suuq	1	*	My point is we fundamentally disagree.   I believe they are a shitty company because of their *chosen* pay rate. The minimum wage represents the smallest amount allowed, not what they *must* pay.

t1_dt72qwv	0	*	Walmart makes a killing on pharmacies and ND doesn't allow Walmart to have them. Wal-Mart tried and failed to change that law. Probably a big factor why they've bailed out.

t1_dt77cn4	0	*	So if you have a university degree you agree you should pay a higher rate because it was subsidized?
t1_dt6s1jk	1	*	No, but he very much has an effect on it. Business and investor confidence is effected by the words of the people making policies on trade and regulation

t1_dt76hih	1	*	It's only a few of them, single digit. Look at Switzerland where there's a SIG in every house.
t1_dt6ma2g	0	*	I never said all brown people want to kill the gays. I said they are exponentially less tolerant of them, and therefore that would cause a massive culture war that would destabilize a country.

t1_du72v1n	1	*	Good point, I'm not really trying to argue or anything but that is very true.
t1_du94g43	0	*	Perhaps you should.  The discussion is about America's standing, other poster pointed out that it's Trump himself who is unpopular, not America. The topic was still America.

t1_dv1shf4	0	*	But definitely not charged for a crime. And the crime here isnt the lack of consent, its distribution of violent images.
t1_dv1c409	0	*	She'll never go to jail. It's a first offense.   Show me a conviction to jail for the same facts.
t1_dv2vsig	1	*	No they didn't, they said free speech protections were much more robust in the US than they are in a France, which appears to be true.

t1_dv240ma	0	*	Could you just point out which part is worse than my links which show Far-Righters shooting people?  
t1_dv0n1yn	1	*	Correct. There is free speech with extra limitations. Limitations that are seen as necessary in Europe given its history.

t1_dv2bu5g	0	*	You keep saying this garbage.
t1_dv0mlzl	1	*	You don't need to drive to commit traffic violations. You can get one for obstructing traffic, or endangering people without even using a vehicle.
t1_dv2h56i	1	*	?? Its not Isis that the law is defending. All your wars are already censored anyways.
t1_dv0oump	0	*	She's free to say and post whatever she likes, but there are consequences if you break any existing laws, which she did.

t1_dv2t6d3	1	*	nobody said anything like that in the first place.
t1_dv21ti7	1	*	Our laws cover humans not a colony of spiders in a defective skin suit.
t1_dv0q69x	0	*	She is perfectly capable of pointing out what isis is doing without showing them beheading people to children.
t1_dv0mpug	0	*	So why do Americans seem to think it's something pioneered by Americans? Especially considering the French revolution was so much more impactful in Europe compared to what was going on overseas.
t1_dv0rcir	1	*	Lol, keep watching that TV.
t1_dv1kof3	1	*	What? Where did you get this disclaimer nonsense. There is no such law in the US. 
t1_dv0psdd	0	*	I would say that Americans don't understand freedom of speech considering that speech in their country is neither free nor reasonably managed.

t1_dv0r1ik	1	*	Really good. They're able to keep the region destabilized while limiting  negative news by having a lot less soldiers dying then compared to Vietnam. 
t1_dv1llo8	0	*	The literal interpretation of islam as salafists preach it, does just that.

t1_dshye9c	1	*	So? You think elected representatives cant hide shit from the civilian populace?
t1_dshv7ds	0	*	In that case, you can't blame any of society's ills on capitalism because no government had a system identical to Smith's *The Wealth of Nations*.
t1_dsl9od6	0	*	Which isn't relevant considering we were talking about conveyance of sarcasm, not emotion...
t1_dsia8mm	0	*	Not one of the options. Try again. 
t1_dshu1go	0	*	Oh they were serious?!   Wow.. That's sad. I guess the efforts to dumb down the populous are working. No greater thing than getting the sheep to think that the slaughter is for their own good. 
t1_dshtg45	0	*	Youre not clarifying your argument, which tells me that you do actually mean what I said, but for some reason wont admit it. Prove to me Im wrong, or youre admitting that Im right. 
t1_dsi1j1m	0	*	Albert Bro
t1_dshspsc	1	*	thats the end-game!  
t1_dshyigh	1	*	I'm kinda lost here.
t1_dshwhij	0	*	Then stop doing it.
t1_dshxi9c	1	*	I guess we'll never find out since he got banned within his first month on Reddit. I wonder what for.
t1_dsi077j	1	*	All you're doing is preventing meaningful discussion. 
t1_dsk23i5	1	*	Thanks. I know that sounded like  challenge but I have been cut off from news sources for a while and I find I completely miss major events that do not become talking points
t1_dsilzfh	0	*	Ah, the Wikipedia-proof-is-in-pudding argument. Where the outcome is always shitty no matter what.  Well played. 
t1_dshowxh	0	*	So now you acknowledge that it isn't the case at all that there's no evidence, there just simply isn't yet conclusive proof that the public is aware of?
t1_dsbniqa	1	*	u7
t1_dtjtfus	0	*	> no justification for the slaughter of children  hyperboles aren't helping your argument.   have you stopped beating your wife?

t1_dss06zc	0	*	Then why do western muslims blow themselves up, why dont palistanian christians blow themselves up?
t1_dss1n91	0	*	Can you please explain?
t1_dssanoq	0	*	How many Christian terrorists have you heard of? 
t1_dss7puo	1	*	That's a funny paradox. It happens so often that it shouldn't be news, but it's news so rarely that people don't think it happens often. 
t1_dss0wpc	1	*	I never brought up Muslims and their spectrum of views on homosexuality. I'm sorry if I missed that tangent, but it was not germane to the discussion at hand.
t1_dssb570	0	*	Couldn't that just mean they're really impressionable and believe anything that the religious literate tell them 
t1_dss8oeb	0	*	I hear this argument a lot, but its not as if Islamic terrorism is some new development. Do you think its always been geopolitical? If not, when did it become so? 
t1_dsrze1l	0	*	What does that do to negate the point?
t1_dstcmjk	0	*	No matter how hard they believe it still doesn't make them martyrs according to the Quran.
t1_dsseqzu	0	*	Lpt: MacDonald's have amazing bathrooms around the world. It's great especially if you're in a country more accustomed to Turk toilets. 
t1_dstkgc3	1	*	Youre right. They did absolutely nothing at all and this has zero significance due to your arbitrary benchmarks. How could I not have seen that?
t1_dssfnzl	1	*	Not the existential threat part, but fair enough. 
t1_dss6bm2	0	*	Your analogy is absurd. Doctor Oz is a real medical doctor and disseminates woo repeatedly. Good ideas will stand on their own based on reason and evidence, not credentials.
t1_dss58so	0	*	So religion does play a part in people's actions.   Glad you agree.
t1_dsscy3f	1	*	Huh, thanks - didn't know that.  Hand-guns are the worst.   http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-41488081   (fyi, not from US) 
t1_dtcpnpc	0	*	No, you don't understand what I am saying. Stalin had the capability to cover up his massive purges, Putin has to be extremely selective.
t1_dtc7ahc	1	*	I know more about being LGBT than LGBT people despite them actually living and experiencing it every day of their lives. -The rallying cry of mediocre trump supporters everywhere. 
t1_dsnx1p2	1	*	Really, horrific is acceptable vs. not great? 
t1_du44cjd	1	*	It could certainly be an old communist country that adopts capitalistic reforms.   Or we can still continue the embargo that we somehow feel is working. 
t1_du48gdq	0	*	Magnum/Magnus
t1_du42axy	0	*	This is theoretical. Dictators by definition rule with absolute power. The Congress is mostly symbolic like most other dictatorships.
t1_du4jeco	1	*	In reality tho things only get this bad due to systemic under funding over decades.  Also let's not pretend that some of this stuff couldn't get sped up by a decent cash injection. 
t1_du44cwz	1	*	In a government like Cuba's you have to ignore the people that are poor and in poverty because the entire system relies on the perception that everything is perfect.

t1_du46wcr	0	*	Stop defending dictatorships, fucking tankie.
t1_du4e4tp	0	*	Yeah, it's more in shithole territory. 
t1_du4887g	0	*	Serious though: how would that be literally possible? Money has to come from somewhere, no?
t1_du47da3	0	*	You need new facts. California gives more than it receives. They're a huge economy.

t1_du473u9	0	*	Doesnt the whole country do it? Its more about which does it the least.

t1_du48g21	1	*	If Donald Trump can get elected over a career politician with the support of basically every major figure, faking a major election isn't exactly viable as it is in say, North Korea.
t1_du43nm6	1	*	I understand that. However, dictators are able to do this more directly. They don't even need to hide it.
t1_du45ud6	0	*	OPs more of a bottom, tbh.
t1_du5m2z2	1	*	Better than a newt.
t1_du489lu	0	*	Uh, [yes they did](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rican_status_referendum,_2017).
t1_du49z3a	1	*	Thats where OP went, hence the miserable failure.

t1_du4uohy	1	*	He is there I posted about it before. Hes bringing a dog home he rescued down there. So doggy wanna treat
t1_du4ajhh	1	*	We were told everything was fine and ahead of schedule though.
t1_du4y9np	0	*	Money doesn't have to come locally. We have state and federal governments in the USA who have emergency and special funding for things like this.
t1_du58888	1	*	That the statistic quoted is bullshit from the outset. 
t1_du4tgpx	0	*	Ukraine in 2014.  Ukraine 2004.  Georgia 2003.  Kyrgyztan 2005.  Yugoslavia in 2000.  We could go back to before that I suppose, if thats not enough.
t1_du45o1e	0	*	I wouldn't blame Trump (and to be clear - this has been a long thing that way predates Trump), but MTA's financial woes are partially due to the decline of federal transit subsidies!
t1_dtthcfo	0	*	> control the flow of space Do you mean something like the Alcubierre drive?
t1_duo6jhp	0	*	Star fleet is not a social club or fraternal organization.  It is also fictitious.  You still have not answered the question.

t1_du3d1ra	1	*	Colorful bait, but I'm going to pass.
t1_du33na1	0	*	He says he has no guilt because if it wasn't him doing it, someone else would have.
t1_du35pgx	1	*	> He was 12 to 14 years old during Nazi occupation of Hungry.  ...and there were soldiers fighting for the Germans who were younger.  Not sure what your point is here.
t1_du3m06j	0	*	Stay woke bro!!! hahahaha did you see that video where Ben shapiro DESTROYED that feminist? hahaha! George soros am I right??? /s
t1_du38ch3	0	*	So you admit that you are in fact full of shit?
t1_du4gam6	0	*	Oh I get it, this is the new shit I was wrong avoidance technique. You just list stuff at random now. 
t1_dsb7k1x	1	*	That's what Trump says about everyone when they're inconvenient to him, see Bannon for the latest example.  And my comment wasn't about what role Papadopoulos played.
t1_dsahc6t	0	*	You must really have something sophisticated to say. You literally spent your entire comment hurling insults and name calling with zero substance. 
t1_dsamkvu	1	*	Mueller is probably looking because of the audio and/or video he's got damning her. Its okay, buddy! If they're innocent they'll be just fine!
t1_dsaeyob	0	*	Excellent.   Nobody should be beyond the reach of law.
t1_duljo7n	0	*	Secularism is not a replacement for Christianity. It is a perspective on how society should rule itself, nothing more. 
t1_dui1042	0	*	I never said the church.
t1_duj2g7o	0	*	> I mean the Jesus story never happened, its not historic fact, which is what its taught as.  How do you know that?
t1_duhty0l	1	*	The first real economies were palace economies, and relied on local stability to endure. Local stability was achieved through belief in the divine.

t1_ds51k2b	0	*	lol most of the same idiotic liberals that reflexively dismiss every single American journalist on RT is going to also hold the same disdain for 'the Putincept'
t1_ds55oux	1	*	Sometimes breaking eggs doesnt get you a cake, just a messy kitchen.  Again; we said the same thing in iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, etc....
t1_ds6naos	1	*	So judging a whole group based on the actions of one member? That doesn't seem right.

t1_ds4t9ym	0	*	Fair enough. However, I dislike the fact that these fake internet points tend to censor your opinion from others who may agree. 
t1_ds58tqv	0	*	No, I actually fall into the community self defense category
t1_ds7rc6m	1	*	yes, it counts. it's called being hones and not being stabbed in the back.
t1_ds7fxmz	1	*	When Americans do it it's presenting both sides, when Russians do it's whataboutism
t1_ds4r2pa	0	*	Just saying, your prison system is absolute garbage.
t1_ds4w90v	0	*	Some day a Police  officer has a bad day or you have the wrong skin color and thinks you deserve a stupid price. Good luck not getting that price. 
t1_ds4xf7c	0	*	If someone copies an article and rearranges the words just a tad it's still plagiarism. 
t1_ds4vxak	1	*	No, but then someone driving like an idiot isn't as bad as systemic discrimination, so I think the comparison holds. 
t1_ds7i2ih	0	*	Yeah, it's way worse. Russia didn't slaughter/genocide anyone, thankfully 
t1_ds50l73	1	*	No, but it is a pretty good defence against accusations of not serving. 
t1_ds5fmm3	0	*	And open_perspective said Nazi's murdered a woman in an act of terror and it was just a blatant misrepresentation of the facts and an outright lie...
t1_ds4q38g	0	*	Here's one, your elections are rigged 
t1_ds5dgiq	1	*	Crossing a frozen river is called a hike
t1_ds4tc1g	1	*	True, its not a total circle jerk, but I've been banned from left and right subs for simply speaking *slightly* contrary to narrative. That gets pretty frustrating. 
t1_ds5lryi	0	*	You're responsible for Heather's death by your logic.

t1_ds4usjl	1	*	True m8.

t1_ds4y9zm	1	*	That'd have to be a hell of a heist considering the polonium came from a extremely heavily controlled Russian federal breeder reactor.
t1_ds4rtnp	1	*	What's the difference?  Both can be true.
t1_ds4opjv	1	*	well said
t1_ds4vbbk	0	*	And where are you drawing these guesses from? The ether?
t1_ds4t50o	0	*	I never said no one got hurt. I just said tear gas is harmless.
t1_ds532l2	1	*	I'm thinking the same about you actually.  You're fixated on one very specific number and missing the forest for the tree.
t1_ds59uh5	0	*	Look for example to switzerland. They have a lot of private guns(actually very comparable numbers to US) and have a lot less dead from police shootings (and other gun violence). 
t1_ds4yyzw	1	*	It's classified.
t1_ds7qzm4	1	*	she only got probation lol
t1_ds4s3ln	1	*	Because public land use usually has restrictions on it.  It's not a free for all.  
t1_ds7tjkv	1	*	Stalin was part Ossetian, think his dad was Ossetian. Ossetia borders Checheno-Ingushetia though.

t1_ds6im1x	0	*	>  I would go so far as to ally with Putin just to Judas him when I say Ive got his back.  You really think 2 different russian leaders will fall for that in less than 100 years? 
t1_ds4zlfy	1	*	Did you just criticize an entire race of people for generalizing others?  How dense are you?
t1_ds4vvkq	0	*	I'm sorry, I should have phrased that better. I meant that I take criticism from someone who believes in democracy more seriously than criticism from someone who doesn't.
t1_ds4wj3t	0	*	It was [War Pigs ](https://youtu.be/qgz__d0VC5k), it also made more sense in this song, because it was written during the draft

t1_ds4pno5	0	*	Cool story. Still think its a shitty argument to just say I'm a shill. How about you actually say something useful instead of deflecting with a shitty criticism? Try harder next time
t1_ds4u5f0	1	*	What crimes caused the crash?
t1_ds5kghd	1	*	Nice try Vladimir.
t1_ds4w98z	0	*	> The holodomor was not a targeted genocide, mismanagement of an economy is not comparable to an organised attempt to wipe out certain groups of people.  It was absolutely a targeted genocide.

t1_ds4qzn8	0	*	Ok, so just don't enforce the law? What's you solution? 
t1_ds4t7hr	1	*	Not really. I'm not fixed in my positions. Often times, I'm swayed by fellow Redditors, but reddit tends to brigade certain issues that are often not as black and white as they seem.

t1_dt684s2	0	*	I'm saying running a candidate that people actually wanted would have had a greater effect. 
t1_dt6c5vx	1	*	Because presumably, in an ideal world, none of this would be released until the investigation is complete. There's no need to deconstruct a misleading memo until it is released.

t1_dt67kb9	0	*	To piggyback, Dems are just as hawkish as Republicans on war. They just want more accountability in the process of waging war. 
t1_dt66p7q	0	*	Don't lie. The guy was anti trump, and he got fired for it. Lying because you want to be loyal to your party is stupid and what republicans are accused of everyday.

t1_dt6bjdu	1	*	Bingo! I am with you on all counts. But he is putty in the Russian's hands. They played this well and probably are sitting back laughing their asses off that it all worked so well.
t1_dt6hfpf	0	*	Those all contributed but the election was so close that the possibility that Comet had an effect is at least possible

t1_dttxcmo	0	*	Your correct that's is morally wrong, doesn't make it any less true though. Look at what happened to the size of Germany after WWII, if you fight a war and lose there's a chance you lose land.
t1_dttas83	0	*	Well when you put it that way it's actually in Israel's interest to keep Palestine as a multigenerational ghetto without sovereignty.
t1_dttrncv	0	*	Bullshit, Israel's ports were never blockaded and every country is allowed to put troops inside their own borders. 
t1_dtt13es	0	*	As always, its much more complicated than that. Viewing the creation of Israel as some kind of invasion is so simplistic as to render your entire point meaningless.
t1_dtsksri	0	*	Politicians that will roll over and do the United States bidding at a moment's notice.

t1_dttxtfh	0	*	Nope, how well educated are you?
t1_dtbkeh7	0	*	Well duh, what do you think the east means in middle east?  Same thing it means in near east and far east
t1_duwgz2p	0	*	Ixb4ve seen CNN print falsehoods and only redact it a week later.  Sometimes you miss out of the corrections.
t1_duwde6w	0	*	Why are you making up weird parameters to make your point?  Why the last 100 years?    I feel like you're using some weird, dishonest parameters to make your narrative.
t1_duwdbvw	1	*	Never said anything of the sort and if that wasnt a trollpost i honestly feel very sorry for you.
t1_duwk98f	0	*	No, I'm saying the whole west ruined the Middle East rhetoric is absolute bullshit. There has literally never been an extended period of peace in the ME.
t1_duwrces	0	*	>We should have protective services for children in dangerous environments and due process to go with it -- which we do.  Maybe it should be expanded?
t1_duwgyf4	1	*	oooh, well thats not a verified source.  Im going to need something that would be accepted at a university as a source.
t1_du1xqx7	0	*	No, as with ww2 I blame ww1 deaths on Germany, because they were the aggressors.
t1_dulifjn	1	*	Its nice and all, but what does it have to do with me or my comment?
t1_du4g8ft	0	*	And Greenland is an example of when it is acceptable to follow the times of your nearest Muslim country.
t1_du26f7v	0	*	Oh, sorry bud. Both start with A, I'm on mobile and it's been a long day. My apologies friend. But I take the apology back, because you called me an asshole. 
t1_du2wg67	0	*	Nah you know when the chinese military knocks on your door they are there to deliver flowers
t1_du2g3nk	0	*	Not wanting religious practices to interfere with school performance is now 'neo-fascist.'  Also, I'm pretty sure the 'ban' on fasting is more of a recommendation against fasting.
t1_ds9rjss	1	*	Thats all you got for incredibly racist? Plus, that makes me look like I support pumpkin head, huh? 
t1_ds8jx1e	0	*	Yes, you know me and my motivations very well. Your ability to assess situations given no information is impressive. 
t1_dt0wd80	0	*	So because a plan can't be 100% effective in all scenarios, we shouldn't even try to come up with a better system and prevent the use of bad practices?
t1_dt1e57i	1	*	It can. It's just a bad joke
t1_duz0rb9	0	*	My stuff?! Its not my stuff  First rule of israel apologia. Deny the occupation.   What do you think they're protesting here?! Harvey Weinstein? Global warming? 
t1_dtq85vx	0	*	Well considering Islamic extremists apparently kill the most people, that point doesn't seem to hold up.
t1_dtqaqb4	0	*	Have you seen our bases? We are a nation thst has many interest in just about every other sovereign nation. 
t1_dtq8qmx	1	*	Don't bother, this kind of asshole only wants to pick and choose and use pedantry to move the goal posts whenever you give evidence that goes against their world view.
t1_dtq91iu	0	*	deadly attack and mass murder are not the same thing.  Should I put it in all caps and bold for you to comprehend that?
t1_dtreqif	1	*	So can only had news now. Stop being pedantic
t1_dtp33r6	0	*	i guess it comes down to who do you trust, Nunes? who doesnt read source material or... our FBI. I like our boys in blue but thats me

t1_dumq4oo	0	*	right in its big ol eye
t1_dumpbre	0	*	Mmmm, I'm pretty sure a volcano would return this stuff back to it's natural form.   Benign rock laced with minerals.  Also when volcanoes spew, it's pretty toxic to begin with.  
t1_dumpbar	1	*	OH. Same reason you don't throw garbage into a lake or ocean. You don't want to pollute it.
t1_ds9dpfy	0	*	No, I mean schools and hospitals.
t1_dtoth0r	1	*	Good. Theyre not 
t1_dstyyax	0	*	There is vulnerability to an attack, and vulnerability to a catastrophic attack. Some of those points of catastrophic vulnerability are beyond the capabilities of a terrorist group. 
t1_dsb1zmn	1	*	There are a ton of goods produced in Mexico that aren't here in the states. Produce is one of them, this tariff is essentially an non-targeted tax.
t1_dsb1y77	0	*	Holy shit somebody just took Micro Econ 101 watch the fuck out

t1_dsbjzgu	0	*	Benevolent to all democracies 
t1_dseclj4	1	*	Idealism doesn't produce results that we need.
t1_dsbfkez	1	*	Yes, but KJU seems to want what he has. Trump doesn't. That's the difference - KJU is seemingly more capable than Trump, especially considering the resources at hand.
t1_dsb9bhr	1	*	If Trump could get away with killing someone for boring him, or making him look bad, he absolutely would. 
t1_dsb23ol	0	*	But how does that make Mexico pay for the wall? Even with the hypothetical boost in American made purchases (lol...) Mexico still isnt paying for it
t1_dsbyg8b	0	*	Well maybe you could explain it to me? Why do you want to pay more in taxes? 
t1_dsbhgm8	0	*	Hahaha, how can you not see the sheer stupidity here?
t1_dsazyuy	1	*	When did I EVER compare federal income tax to paying sales taxes?
t1_dscforn	1	*	Let me guess ... True socialism hasn't been implemented successfully yet
t1_dsbqfdx	1	*	The 4th season is so good if you actually finish it. The long ended jokes were mind blowing.
t1_dsbbw09	1	*	Vast majority of dictators were intelligent. Ceasar being a prime example. Eradicating nations, does not mean you aren't intelligent.
t1_dsb25q4	0	*	counterpoint:  https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/video/2016/aug/09/trump-clinton-second-amendment-people-video
t1_dsg62z6	0	*	Theyre not coming across. Duh. Want to stop immigration then raid the illegal workplaces.  You dont need an asinine wall. 
t1_dsbap58	0	*	So they are metaphorically paying for the wall. No actual Mexican money will be used to pay for it. Got it. Thanks.
t1_dser5br	0	*	so my argument stands... a SIGNIFICANT (not a majority) portion pays taxes in
t1_dsb43ey	1	*	...I suggest you take a course on reading comprehension, and try again.
t1_dsazxiz	0	*	Yeah so let them come here legally that way they get the same protections as natural born citizens
t1_dsbtvfe	1	*	No it wont... it will just raise your prices. We are not gonna stop trading with Mexico.
t1_dsb3jwx	0	*	> but now they will lose that money and this will help boost the American economy  if trade deals didn't boost our own economy we wouldn't have done them dingus 
t1_dsbcziy	1	*	I'm gonna to defer you to what the person immediately before you (/u/paddywacknack) said:  > So use it on efficient border security not a stupid fucking wall.
t1_dsbti73	0	*	>weve been socially conditioned to think it is wrong to kill someone.   And yet people do that on purpose every day. 
t1_dsb5lvc	0	*	Democrats showed zero willingness to work on a tax plan. So they got it done with a simple majority. If the democrats get their majority, they'll do the same thing. 
t1_dsbf31o	0	*	Yep. That was the point. Mexico is generally a shit hole. Especially near the US - Mexico border.
t1_dsb35s9	0	*	His sources are the click bait, conservative Facebook pages he follows. My guess would be a Palin fed the parrot this particular drivel. 
t1_dsb50s5	1	*	I hate false logic. Get back to the kiddie table.
t1_dsbg5e3	0	*	You're conflating immigrants with illegal aliens, that's your problem right there.
t1_dsb4z6q	1	*	Not by most, but some (eg China) might.  The priblem is that nobody really wins in a trade war, consumers just get universally shat upon
t1_dsb9h5f	1	*	With all the assumption fueled anger there isn't any room for intellectual conversation, it's a shame to see people who choose to live this way
t1_dsb8nwz	0	*	> he thinks that being a genius makes it ok to be a bitter old man who only sees the negative in everything.  He thinks that? Really? Can you give me a source of him saying that?
t1_dsb2j2z	1	*	You have more faith in technocrats than I do. I'm actually for more funding for education but through vouchers because the state system is so corrupt
t1_dsaygzy	0	*	Your only argument is that the person you are replying to might not know the answer? Wow, such debate skills!
t1_dsb1ytw	1	*	Something Trump is too stupid, egotistical, or senile to learn.
t1_dsbd3s2	0	*	I bet you look a lot like a popsicle in the winter with that giant stick up your ass :)
t1_dse3unw	1	*	sure, i'll send you a pm
t1_dsazqjq	0	*	You will need a order from a judge in order to ask for the immigration status of a particular person.
t1_dsc4013	0	*	No idea what deductions you're talking about, nor do I care...  It doesn't affect me. 
t1_dsbbpa5	0	*	See, you advocate for open borders for the US, but get mad when the same is done for your country.
t1_dsbc9vi	0	*	There's a reason why so many Mexicans have to sneak across the border.  They are poor as fuck and don't have cars.  I can't tell if you're regular old reddit-stupid or actually retarded.
t1_dsbbelb	1	*	... or end a few. 
t1_dsb2w34	0	*	If Person A makes a claim, then Person B disagrees with it, it's up to Person B to say why he disagrees with it, it's not up to Person A at all.  You have the burden of proof ass-backwards.
t1_dsb1yro	0	*	Pretty sure Texas is the only red state that gives more to the government than it recieves back.
t1_dsc8388	0	*	Snide reference?  I think you have some bug up your ass that you need to shit out elsewhere.  I don't think you know what youre talking about.
t1_dsb8jvg	1	*	Truth is stranger than fiction
t1_dsbxwht	0	*	You misunderstand.  The point is Trump didn't concede it wasn't happening.
t1_dsb7if9	1	*	I personally think the only difference between the two is that Trump was born an American and Kim wasn't.
t1_dsbbiot	0	*	...To pay for the wall.  lol
t1_dsb6gfc	0	*	Again, the gun control debate is another topic and if you want to have it, fine, send me a pm, but rn too busy disproving open border advocates
t1_dsfsg76	1	*	How do you determine who's lying and who's telling the truth?  Edit: How is it harming people?
t1_dsbt9hf	1	*	I don't believe your chain of events ever happened.   Now watch people ignore the phrase 'chain of events'.
t1_dsbczn4	1	*	I don't think it's actually that difficult.  The nuclear fission bomb is over 70 years old now.
t1_dsazxla	0	*	Either American consumers pay for the wall or American consumers choose not to purchase the Mexican goods due to price increase and then American tax payers pay for the wall. 
t1_dsb20w5	1	*	Protectionist tariffs don't help the American economy, they hurt it. 
t1_dsb6x52	1	*	maybe more of a background of slave states arent gonna sign if they dont have a way to ensure slavery's existence
t1_dsb745s	1	*	Unless the pilot is authorized to fly into America, the federal aviation administration will likely see them.
t1_dsb25aa	1	*	It depends on the program. Red states tend to take more anti-poverty dollars whereas blue states take more infrastructural dollars. Overall, I'm not sure there's much of a per capita difference.
t1_dsb2dfw	0	*	If the tax it's a general thing, it couldn't be unconstitutional. But then would be absurd. 
t1_dsb61ic	0	*	Then you'll pay them happily.
t1_dsb8nj0	0	*	> Not all trump supporters are like that though.  Yes, yes they are.  You have to deny reality to convince yourself hes somehow doing a great job 
t1_dsbn9c7	0	*	Dude, most of the dictators in history were pretty smart people, just really evil ones too.  Being smart and ruthless is usually how one gets to be a dictator in the first place.
t1_dscdiul	1	*	No, nobody in power really wants to build it.
t1_dsbw3xp	1	*	stop with what?
t1_dsg65zr	0	*	Are you going to refer me to Sarah Huckabee Sanders next? Faux News?

t1_dtxi76k	0	*	How are you defining English? Born in England sounds like a good definition to me. Are you talking about ethnicity?

t1_dtxcfuc	0	*	India is in Asia.
t1_dtxrtvm	1	*	Since when did the people of the US have a say in what the government does?
t1_dtxcxgy	0	*	So 30 percent chinese (east and south east asian specifically) and 11 percent indian (south asian really) if you dont want to read the article.
t1_dtxp0qv	1	*	Cheers for the clarification. I thought you might have been referring to the famine during WW2, as the British were shipping out food to support the war effort.

t1_dtyhke3	1	*	I'm not sure I understood your comment
t1_dtxe91v	0	*	Well if look at it that way,going to the god damn dentist is politics. Because health care right?
t1_dtxh2k5	1	*	Aint nothin wrong with a little strange.
t1_dtxawzd	0	*	So what's the difference between that and insisting that X will be good for you if you only have some more, in the face of statistical and anecdotal evidence that the opposite is in fact the case?
t1_dtxq54w	1	*	It's a truly wonderful thing.  
t1_dtxkqp8	0	*	Yea I'd argue that statement only works when applied to Puerto Rico. 
t1_dtxux7l	0	*	She isn't the queen of the UK. She is the queen of England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and wales. Technically the UK but it is 4 different countries.it makes sense for her to stay in the British isles
t1_dtxg1h1	1	*	But maybe not nearly as bad as in America... I think was what another guy was getting at. It's sick and fucking embarrassing how our president speaks about immigration. 
t1_dtxd1oz	0	*	It's Rani :) 
t1_dtxdzdf	0	*	In Markham they no longer use the number 4 in house numbers in new subdivisions. Pretty sure they were already doing this in condos.
t1_dtxqppe	0	*	Well considering 90% of primary schools in Ireland are run by the church not everyone can afford that luxury.  Not sure why your kids exposure to polish kids is relevant though. 
t1_dtxkskb	1	*	I feel like hes asserted his political agenda in the past. I mean even though theyre all lizard people any way he seems doubly lizard. 
t1_dtxeh3e	0	*	Yeah I wouldn't want open borders with Russia or Serbia either, it's not an ethnic thing. Open borders only work if there's economic and cultural parity between the countries involved.
t1_dtxpkdz	1	*	Thank you, well put. I resent being used as a make weight in someone's confused morality. 
t1_dtxokfn	1	*	No, I don't.

t1_dtxhnaw	0	*	xa37 an hour is too low for hard labour. You are making the OPs point.
t1_dtxy4zn	1	*	And New Zealands wage is much lower with significantly higher costs. Relative to income most of our cities are among the most unaffordable in the world.
t1_dtxp32b	0	*	Didn't it just. Thankfully rectified now, but it was a serious injustice.

t1_dswyyrb	0	*	News Flash: A fetus is a human being. If you doubt this, consult any embyrology textbook.
t1_dswj9yi	0	*	I would take asshole over liar any day of the week. 
t1_dsxxzsk	0	*	>But they don't meet the criteria, because the criteria includes not having a core goal in your organization that is dedicated to removing the rights of others.  They meet the rest though.  
t1_dsx29wr	1	*	Thanks!
t1_dswtyj1	0	*	We don't convict people for crimes they haven't yet committed and we don't treat fetuses as a person till they are one.  Law is based on the now. The personhood of a fetus is a (uncertain) future.
t1_dswswk0	1	*	Isn't this exactly the reason assissted suicide was passed in Canada?
t1_dswmerq	1	*	He was pretty frequently compared to a poorly oiled robot.
t1_dswo1ko	0	*	No, it is not.  Just for fun, when do you think human life begins?
t1_dsxgx6u	0	*	I am not aware of any other group using the program to fund protesters. Do you have proof to back up that statement?
t1_dsx5u6b	0	*	That's dumb
t1_dsx47z0	0	*	By that logic newborns also should not have rights and you don't believe that child abuse exists. If there is any dependency required, they are not required to give it.
t1_dswkih5	0	*	Until you can clearly draw the line you don't actually know when something becomes a baby. 
t1_dswnt63	0	*	Really? You see smoking cigarettes and the complex issue of unplanned/unwanted/unprepared pregnancy as comparable situations?
t1_dsxpip9	1	*	You think women pop plan B like Tums and get abortions like they're pedicures, don't you?
t1_dtm6xom	0	*	Yeah everything between baby and adult IS considered human.  Notice that fetus is not in between those stages.
t1_dswtvra	0	*	Because it was literally my experience growing up in the church. 
t1_dswolst	1	*	Sure I do...one of those things doesn't need government funding.
t1_dswqu0k	1	*	No hope of survival. Im thinking those comatose on a life support machine. If you take medication to live and with it can love a normal life, thats fine.  I should have expressed it more clearly sorry
t1_dswlxnv	1	*	That's the debate. And just because the debate is settled in Canada, that doesn't mean we should legally discriminate against those still on the losing side. 
t1_dsx72ty	0	*	No.  Obviously we should force people to get vasectomies 
t1_dsz58za	0	*	Yes. He's allowed to do that, just like churches are allowed to only hire priests who believe the same things they do. 
t1_dsx2yze	0	*	Nope.  Not inside you, not your body, you have no say.
t1_dsxeypp	0	*	Sure, so what? The opposition fueled, running on empty, doesnt really matter, they are wrong.
t1_dsza8g6	1	*	Yeah i was kidding.
t1_dswlknd	0	*	Come back when you've at least studied the law a bit.
t1_dswn6xf	1	*	Yeah, it is. By that line of logic women should always be pregnant to guarantee the greatest right to life.
t1_dswo8q9	1	*	Barking up the wrong tree man man gotta hit the cornershop for a loosie.
t1_dsxpx3d	0	*	Ah, you don't know what a compromise is. I'm guessing you're only 13 and haven't gotten to that point in your history classes. Once you pass 8th grade, we can pick this discussion back up. 
t1_dsykf0s	1	*	Do you see the fact that people still do it born out in your numbers? Because they definitely show that...
t1_dsx01bs	1	*	It's opinion you godless heathen 
t1_dsxa099	1	*	An organization advocating for there anti-abortion stance is not necessarily doing anything beyond voicing an opinion. 
t1_dswqld9	1	*	TIL various Chinese languages are written the same. That's cool!
t1_dswqety	0	*	Once it no longer requires an unwilling host to physically sap energy from to survive. 
t1_dswrtv6	1	*	Not familiar at all with Canadian legislature but can the Charter of Rights not be updated? 
t1_dswmv91	0	*	In my opinion? When it is viable outside of the women's body.   However, I do support late term abortions in cases of medical emergencies and other medical reasons.   
t1_dswofur	0	*	Maybe if you've never studied another language in your life. 
t1_dswrg2d	0	*	That's your opinion. I only think they have the right to argue theirs, instead of arguing the point you are turning the validity of the argument on its head
t1_dsy0chi	1	*	It makes it **a** right.  And that's how governments work.  They are there to protect the rights of the citizens.  
t1_dswrdq2	1	*	It's like you didn't even read what I wrote.
t1_dswqh0h	1	*	It could have become human if you waited to have sex instead of savagely aborting thousands of innocent, LIVING sperm in to a sock. 
t1_dszqa9w	0	*	Just like homosexual rights? abortion rights (ie: womens rights)?
t1_dswq2qm	0	*	>If it's not your body *or your baby* your opinion is irrelevant.  
t1_dsxcw57	0	*	Trudeau went to court and demanded he pay out millions to terrorists?
t1_dsx9w3m	0	*	Their reasoning is theological, but their main motive is to protect the unborn.
t1_dswldjr	0	*	I think you're wrong, there's no legal protection against advocacy. If there is there damn well shouldn't be.
t1_dswoqvw	0	*	The impoverished addict is a result of prohibition. 
t1_dswrbp9	0	*	>immoral to tell someone what to do with their body.  Unless they want to murder a fetus
t1_dswmxbd	0	*	Wait, so children are better off in foster care than being killed? 
t1_dswqf9v	1	*	Not really,  otherwise it wouldn't become so widespread. 
t1_dsx00x9	1	*	Saying you disagree EXTRA HARD isn't really the killer argument some of you seem to think. 
t1_dswpyrp	1	*	I mean it is a human too, by any scientific definition
t1_dsy415z	0	*	Please explain. I simply said that a new human organism is formed at fertilization. That is embryologically uncontroversial.
t1_dswrvtr	0	*	I believe science is useful for understanding what's going on in there so we can decide, hopefully as a species one day, exactly when the clump of cells is worth caring about. 
t1_dsxvpem	1	*	They are welcome to run on a pro life platform and likely to be punished for it 
t1_dsx2yfd	1	*	Nope.  Not inside you, not your body, you have no say.
t1_dswvpyy	1	*	Oh man. I haven't heard anyone refer to a cigarette as a dart since I graduated university in Canada
t1_dswm9po	0	*	Whats done is done.
t1_dswpyb6	0	*	Once its able to think, until then its a glorified parasite.
t1_dsxder8	1	*	Because they will never possibly be viable for live outside the womb. And also don't show any brain activity. 
t1_dsxk5jm	1	*	I don't need you to. The Wikipedia page tells me Canada has similar anti freedom laws.
t1_dswq173	1	*	No because of the unique genetic code that exists in each fetus. There's a difference between saying that a zygote deserves to become a human, and saying that every gamete must result in a human.
t1_dswtozg	1	*	Thats what legally not a person means. A fetus isnt a person. 
t1_dswf5xr	0	*	There is more than one type of discrimination in the world. Just because some is more important doesn't mean the other is good. 
t1_dswqe8f	1	*	I ask the finance minister to answer the question, honestly, or resign. Mr speaker, will the finance minister answer the question, or will he resign?
t1_dswp1c6	0	*	Again- in your mind. And that's fine, but rest assured. It will come around again despite what you appear to believe so assuredly.
t1_dsxv91j	0	*	Why don't you make a specific point, coward. Vagueness is weak.
t1_dsx9fns	0	*	Each mother. 
t1_dswlxa8	0	*	01
t1_dswrhkd	0	*	Condoms break, birth control interacts strangely with antibiotics, men who have had vasectomies sometimes still produce active sperm.  I wouldn't call any of this irresponsibility.
t1_dsx7sd1	1	*	It's not my math - it's from an Ipsos Reid poll. [Source.](http://nationalpost.com/news/canada/new-poll-shows-most-canadians-support-abortion-with-some-restrictions)
t1_dsx1zm3	0	*	i believe in outlawing abortion except in the obvious emergency cases, and improving access to birth control, and public education on them
t1_dswpmm6	1	*	Better to let it go to term and leave it in a dumpster. 
t1_dswofat	0	*	You mean the party that *lost* to the conservatives? two winning options. Denial of the problem means we can't fix it. 
t1_dswq7vh	1	*	Just like cheery
t1_dswwa0s	0	*	More people voted for Hillary than Trump too but they don't compare the total number of votes. They group the votes and then compare the groups or something like that.
t1_dswz4xd	0	*	>Abortion is denying a life for the betterment of your own.  Lol that is not what abortions are at all.
t1_dsxzwvm	0	*	In the real world, where almost everyone considers pro-abortion to be synonymous with pro-choice. 
t1_dsws06v	0	*	Nails are not alive, so it's not. However, your skin is. Including foreskin and all the places where you might have piercings. 
t1_dswz0oh	0	*	>You did not seriously just equate that to flat earthers, who are a virtually nonexistent group.  Creationism has as much proof as flat earth, literally none.
t1_dswvjr0	1	*	Just looked it up and apparently we do it the same. But that's basically the same thing as the Prime Minister picking them.
t1_dsxmmiy	0	*	name of ... North America ... South America... end your life
t1_dswpi4o	0	*	Its quite literally the Democrats threatening a shutdown over DACA
t1_dswob8h	1	*	A mandate is not conscious, and cannot believe in anything. 
t1_dswqh1f	0	*	I actually laughed a little out loud reading that. Birth is dangerous for the child, so lets kill it instead...nice
t1_dsxu72i	1	*	Nope.
t1_dswnk2j	1	*	Pro-life groups are advocating *for* rights for the unborn. Easy rebuttal, your argument is flawed. The analogy with gay rights was perfectly valid. This is a discriminatory action by the government.
t1_dsx7l29	1	*	http://vancouversun.com/news/staff-blogs/why-stephen-harper-keeps-his-evangelical-faith-very-private
t1_dsx97j1	0	*	I'm opposed to the death penalty. 
t1_dsx8m3f	1	*	Smart people can be politically cynical or deluded; happens all the time. Take a look at today's GOP... half of which went to Harvard/Princeton/Yale.
t1_dswmpzd	1	*	It's okay, it's pretty difficult to find a credible source that says banning abortion is a good thing. 
t1_dsxyoq5	1	*	Exactly. 
t1_dsyigz5	0	*	Except that abortion is not murder, because a pre-viable fetus is not a person with rights and freedoms to consider.  So your analogy does not work.
t1_dswyhro	1	*	Hats off to you. This would have been an excellent addition in yesterdays [White Mirror](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/7rb2rh/if_they_made_a_show_called_white_mirror_that_was/) thread. 
t1_dsxzk1k	0	*	...and then the body working to create the fetus. You are trolling or have no scientific literacy at all. 
t1_dswryxg	0	*	Constitutionally protected right does not really mean anything in Canada, considering how relatively easy it is to amend the constitution
t1_dswq6rh	0	*	Maybe antiabortion groups are trying to GIVE rights to unborn babies?
t1_dswz8ea	1	*	Yeah but even if you're not religious and are anti abortion, this applies. It's simply silencing groups which go against the status quo.
t1_dswo2h4	0	*	Do they lose their rights then?
t1_dsws7g3	0	*	Read the comment chain.
t1_dsxglt1	0	*	My point is that an abortion is not a cut and dry, black and white issue at all, obviously you agree that abortion for nonmemedical reasons at a certain point in the pregnancy is unacceptable. 
t1_dsxrlaf	0	*	No, the cautious choice is not ending a potential life.   If you aren't certain whether or not a fetus is a human life then ending it is potentially murder. 
t1_dswphs8	0	*	Youre wrong. There is no debate. The debate was settled by R. v Morgentaler and Tremblay v Daigle. The debate is over. Your side lost once and for all. 
t1_dswvl74	0	*	Women give up their bodily autonomy when they choose to have sex and get pregnant.
t1_dswlq4s	0	*	Why does whether something is inside a womb change whether something is alive or not?
t1_dswntq3	0	*	Letterkenny for all! 
t1_dswn1qs	0	*	It's YouTube. The video could be literally anyone saying those things. How hard is it to understand that YouTube is one of the most non credible sources?
t1_dszfw4s	0	*	Because no one is being oppressed.  They just can't have free money.  It's weird that confuses you.
t1_dswn6et	0	*	This got lifted [recently](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/new-brunswick-abortion-restriction-lifted-by-premier-brian-gallant-1.2850474) Like late November of last year.
t1_dswqya3	0	*	So who is fighting for the baby to *have* the right to born? That's still fighting for a right. 
t1_dswp5xf	0	*	Abortions will clearly not go up if it's made illegal. That's ridiculous.
t1_dsxdy9h	0	*	No, it is keeping consistent with their own policies.  But you're saying that's bad because Canada might turn into a dictatorship who will use policies consistency  as precedence to do bad stuff?  Ok.
t1_dswrot2	0	*	True, society will progress hopefully to reach a stage where abortion is so rare it's not even an issue. But for now it is a necessary part of our world.
t1_dszvp83	0	*	> My opinion is my opinion and it can only affect me.  Not as long as you live in a democracy. Then your opinion through general election affects everyone in that democracy.
t1_dsx8ukr	1	*	And if she doesn't, let her dump that egg. 
t1_dswpklp	0	*	Its the law. 
t1_dswy2fj	0	*	You evaded my question, do you believe groups that think women shouldn't be allowed to work should be funded by tax dollars?
t1_dswrp35	0	*	you: its not clear cut, what about rape victims  me: If you have to immediately use those scenarios to justify all abortion you have a weak argument  you: yeah but what if you bust inside her
t1_dswsvfp	1	*	Being lgbt isn't a political stance so that's a dumb comparison 
t1_dswq0ci	0	*	I stand corrected.
t1_dswodrz	1	*	So the group is not against women getting abortions? The group in question approves of abortions?
t1_dswkhww	0	*	That is like saying arguing for vegetarianism is against peoples rights to eat meat.  That's not necessarily true at all.
t1_dswr149	1	*	Okay SkeletonHitler.
t1_dswo5eg	1	*	I chuckled through the child comments until I got here at which point I cackled. Well done.
t1_dsx9p8f	0	*	Is it better to live a bad life or not live a life at all?
t1_dswvip9	0	*	Ah look they did it by ethnicity. So papau new guinea with 6 billion different tribes is one of the most racially diverse? No.  America is the most racially diverse country on the planet
t1_dsxxhlr	1	*	I know this is an appeal to emotion instead of logic. And Ive been in similar shoes and feel for you.  But possibly.
t1_dsx03bv	1	*	Try to fucking think about it. It'll come to you even if you are a little slow. 
t1_dswkze7	0	*	murder is when one human being kills another. abortion is murder.  if you want it to be an affirmative defense for murder, then you might have a valid argument.
t1_dsxhvul	1	*	Ah I see. It'd be a pretty poor reason to use in Canada. 
t1_dswsggn	1	*	The point is both beliefs are irrelevant
t1_dswpspj	0	*	And all abortion providers are totally scrupulous and above-board.
t1_dswmlkq	0	*	If you can't afford an adoption how can you possibly afford to actually raise a child?
t1_dswrimi	0	*	And correct me if I'm wrong but the article states that restrictive laws lead to more unsafe abortions, not more total abortions
t1_dswz518	0	*	No, because the dead arent alive  Functioning brain ain't part of the question
t1_dswqh4q	0	*	And semen and eggs? Are they protected as well? 
t1_dsy3g2a	1	*	Well for one its a view most Canadians oppose and for two why should a group that promotes values counter t he charter get funding.  Should a pro slavery group get funding?
t1_dsx5kt8	0	*	So,  your argument is that it is ok to kill your appendix but it is not ok to kill half a dozen cells?   That is a horrible argument to stand behind; just saying
t1_dsxinqv	1	*	And thats why its a debate. Neither side is cut and dry. Neither side is some crazy enemy... Im pro life and I dont think that means Im an asshole trying to control womens bodies. 
t1_dswrfgf	0	*	Morally justify aborting a healthy baby where the mother isn't in danger
t1_dswxx61	1	*	That's a part of it but it actually comes about by the fostering in the womb. 
t1_dswp47t	0	*	analogies are considered weak arguments because things that may look the same on the surface, arent when u look deeper, and the analogy becomes fallacious.
t1_dsx78m2	0	*	Women have late term abortions for fun?  Really?
t1_dsy7cqc	0	*	Nobody is stopping anyone from speaking their mind.  You're doing it right now.    Have you read the actual paragraph in question? 
t1_dsxbbi9	1	*	And the inverse would be that what you call pro choice, pro lifers call pro murder
t1_dswpe38	0	*	But most are not getting their funding cut.
t1_dsxpkf8	0	*	So you assume facts to back up your claims?  If you can't see why that matters then I guess it doesn't.
t1_dswn4qe	0	*	Seriously. Cows are much more intelligent than a fetus and we dont mind killing millions a year. 
t1_dswsfwl	0	*	Comparing anti-abortion groups to the KKK and terrorists who not only provide a threat to those around then but objectively to the nation as a whole is absurdity. 
t1_dswnbvh	1	*	Thx for explaining your definition.  Is your suggested criterion for allowing abortion an axiom or is it derived from other opinions you hold?
t1_dswlro7	0	*	Well that isn't entirely true either now is it. One judge did, two judges didn't and four judges basically shrugged their shoulders and decided it was unnecessary to decide.
t1_dswqkv3	1	*	lol what. You can't compel random people to donate organs just cause you're dying. That's why it's such a big deal to States and NGOs to get organ donors signed up.
t1_dswk5xf	0	*	No it wouldn't.
t1_dsyd5u7	0	*	Oh yeah, the part where he had no charisma.  Well, boo fucking hoo, sometimes you have to actually listen to the words or actions, not the tone of voice or fast talking BS.
t1_dswx32w	1	*	based on their weird, aggressive post history i have to assume this is a troll account.
t1_dswp038	0	*	What I quoted is the relevant section, it's on the R. v. Morgentaler wiki under Aftermath as well.
t1_dswts5u	0	*	As an Albertan, we could use another PM like that!
t1_dsx0yk3	0	*	health funding is provincial.  any Provence that tried to do that would have their federal health, education and social assistance tax transfer cut off.  it'd be political suicide.
t1_dswukme	0	*	My point was that's how pro-lifers see it. To ask them to compromise on abortion would be like trying to convince General Sherman to only burn down a couple houses in Atlanta and go home.
t1_dswp308	0	*	Negative that person who has the child is paying for it. If they kill it or let it die then they will go to prison. You have sex you are actively acknowledging the possibility of having a child.
t1_dswn11c	0	*	Well if they actually overturn _Roe_ theyve effectively eliminated the concept of case law in this country, which I dont even think even extremists like Gorsuch or Roberts would be willing to do.
t1_dswpg3r	0	*	The Supreme Court of Canada ruled that a fetus is not a person, and has no status under the law. 
t1_dswojsd	0	*	The vast majority of children in the foster care system aren't eligible for adoption. The end goal for their cases is to reunite them with their biological parents.

t1_dsx3h18	1	*	Out tax payer money going towards paying teenagers to harass people on the street. No thank you. Ever.
t1_dswrj3b	1	*	If you're worried about jobs and charitable services, this tax money would be much better spent on actual business and charities. 
t1_dswtm7u	1	*	Colonist filth?
t1_dswt741	0	*	No opinions were banned thankfully so Canada still fits your definition of democracy 
t1_dswpp0j	0	*	I hate you
t1_dsx60fj	0	*	But the choice to get pregnant or not is made earlier.  She chooses to risk getting pregnant. Why not just make the right decision there and not kill a baby for no good reason?
t1_dswviue	1	*	Thank you! 
t1_dswqu51	0	*	Ironic because although he lives in Calgary, he went to school in Toronto and maybe even grew up there.
t1_dswp1z5	0	*	Their souce of income is drugs. If you think they're running out of addicts you don't know much about drugs.
t1_dswwfdx	1	*	Just like how the Clinton campaign was worried Obama might (not) come across as elitist so they started pushing that argula bullshit.
t1_dswlve6	0	*	If its alive then there is life the only time abortion is acceptable if the mother's health is at risk
t1_dswpys9	1	*	I'm not aware of me making that comparison.

t1_dt086ni	0	*	Sick job ignoring my comment lol
t1_dswqfcl	0	*	I'm sure you've heard this before, but if making murder legal lowered murder-rates, it'd make murder moral?
t1_dswp8br	0	*	No, it's not biologically. It has the biologic potential to become a human, but it isn't yet.

t1_ds14piv	0	*	The far right tries to ban critical speech wherever they gain power. That has nothing to do with hate speech laws except to they extent they act as a counter to racist, authoritarian movements.     
t1_ds35ce2	0	*	Yes, that's literally what arbitrary, state-enforced hate speech laws will do.

t1_dt9b6pf	0	*	And equating the Dem issues with republican issues is just as delusional. Bill clinton lied, Trump worked with a foreign power to put himself in power. 
t1_dta03pd	1	*	Why? Because they have a history of being proven right, as they were with this article. Clearly, their anonymous sources are legitimate. 
t1_dt9hxlv	0	*	For the record, I doubt that trump is actually guilty of collusion.  Question:  if he was found guilty of money laundering/tax evasion, would you still support him as our president?

t1_ds6nk0l	1	*	Reverse em and then comment back with some substance mate.
t1_ds6ezva	0	*	No, it has a big sphere of influence, an army and a strong economy for that.
t1_ds67fb5	0	*	Yes you do. Now imagine him spreading crisco all over his body.
t1_ds66c7t	0	*	Why are you being defensive? I didnt attack you (or anyone), so theres no need to defend yourself. You seem to be reading things into my comment that arent there. 
t1_ds6dkcv	1	*	You expect your politicians to tell you the truth? You maverick!
t1_ds731mt	1	*	That's Slaneesh lying to you.
t1_ds6hba0	1	*	Wow lol what Iraq war was fought for Israel, [they get 3/4 of their oil from Zionist backed Kurds in Iraq](https://www.ft.com/content/150f00cc-472c-11e5-af2f-4d6e0e5eda22).
t1_ds5yvhr	0	*	So it's slightly pegged?
t1_ds6dii2	1	*	911, the gift that keeps on giving
t1_ds61uo8	0	*	A strong dollar means we import more, and export less.
t1_ds6aswe	0	*	Man, that was a really good rebuttal. You really showed him!
t1_dv0itjm	0	*	I still have no idea what that means
t1_dv1hnaw	1	*	I admire you for arguing with a brick, I really do, but it's *so not worth it.*
t1_dv0bh14	0	*	Well shit, lucky we dont have a metric fuckton of guns like that shithole over the ocean.
t1_ds5d37k	0	*	>You should feel good about yourself after that.  Hard to feel good about the 30% of Americans who support Trump. I kinda like my country and I'd rather they not try to destroy it for lulz.
t1_ds4fi9i	0	*	If you went to Palestine you really were in Israel. 
t1_ds4mibh	0	*	You mean instead of opposing the illegal occupation by the settler-colonial apartheid state that was constructed on their land?
t1_ds4zs6p	0	*	Why not? They blame Israelis as a whole.
t1_ds5kaot	0	*	Or you learn how to discuss in a civil conversation next time. I hope you don't speak like that in person. You'll never win a debate with ad hominem's.
t1_ds4mxr4	1	*	It's just a statement to get everyone's prejudices out in the open.  
t1_ds4vb0d	1	*	And it doesn't get you a country. It's their choice really.
t1_duajo1d	1	*	I realize this sick, sad, world, worldview. Those were just my ideas. Hopefully some day we can get there, and that should be the ultimate goal. 
t1_duag47d	0	*	He or she thinks we can get rid of all of the guns but opposes enforcing the immigration laws because we can't get all the illegals...
t1_duaem1z	1	*	I like it, YOU'RE HIRED!!!
t1_du29cf4	0	*	Why do you care so much?
t1_du2rv2m	0	*	Yes. They also have the right to be obliterated, if they do. Very, very simple.
t1_du2m2s2	1	*	Yes.
t1_du2dw2j	1	*	I am afraid it is your reading comprehension that is failing. Obviously Syria sees all of Israel as fair game, it just cannot do anything about it, with a notable exception of one downed plane.
t1_dtmybsl	1	*	What your uncle was too much of a stooge to buy you hotdogs?
t1_dth2dte	0	*	why did you write any of that?

t1_dtg17k4	0	*	I was talking about the examples he gave, not what trump said.
t1_dtol6je	0	*	It is if reason X itself isnt clear. You could easily be conflicted on reason X.
t1_dtng2wt	1	*	To be fair i think britain exports more services than products these days which would be covered in a trade deal. 
t1_dtncsvy	0	*	You mean the cleveland browns?
t1_dtnnq0t	1	*	Dear God you just made me want to believe in God again, I forgot that's where all the HOA people go.
t1_dtnj4pe	0	*	But they won't. There are millions of them living in other EU countries, and those billions aren't going to be replaced.
t1_dtnfybj	0	*	Jaguar isnt even British any more it was sold to an indian company years ago. I think they still make them here though. 
t1_dv4ix2x	0	*	>As soon as he was elected the American Left was doomed.  So doomed that Donald Trump lost the popular election by 3 million votes. Lulz.  You're way too invested in your Russian handpuppet.
t1_dsr0dnw	1	*	If that's the case then Martin Luther King was the deriding the left for being leftist and that makes no fucking sense
t1_dsqv65j	0	*	I'll take it up with literally no one then.
t1_dt8kkkx	1	*	>The only ones who destroy countries and put radical Islamists in power are the Zionists via America.   Dude, I bet those Muslims would like to exchange a word or ten with you.

t1_dt8fbg7	0	*	yes, let's support the development of another theocratic Muslim nation. hooray. that is what the world needs. 
t1_dt8ervx	0	*	I'm talking about residents of the west bank and gaza.

t1_ducefz8	0	*	you said you have learned your lessons, why are you even arguing this?  The victims have demanded reparations and you are talking about technicalities?
t1_duchw18	1	*	I think they were making the comparison to Leopold. Killed fewer people but was wayyy more of a dick about it 
t1_ducm54y	0	*	If turkey is not willing to pay reparations for the mistakes of a government from 100 years ago then the least they should do is acknowledge the previous mistakes of that government.
t1_ducaalu	0	*	Yeah, I mean, I'm not trying to say he isn't. Like I said, It's just the text I hear scrolling through my brain when I want to say this guy kind of sucked, didn't he?
t1_ducjy9x	0	*	Governments -don't- inherit mandates to govern. Every single election they must re-earn their mandate to govern from the body politic.
t1_dudzsk1	1	*	best ask in /r/askhistorians
t1_dsg7r22	0	*	Isn't Iran itself a multi ethnic country?
t1_dsgp4z6	1	*	Hahahahaha. No way. I'm firm. You won't persuade me, ever. Nice try though. Seriously, find something else to do. 
t1_dupa1q4	0	*	I literally gave you the link man. You are the one who dismissed it based on your anecdotes. 
t1_duohjvy	1	*	It has its uses so long as you dont post every moment of your life on it
t1_dungvce	1	*	Not shaking hands between sexes isn't a law, it's a cultural thing. And  even if it was a law, it's not against women, it's equal for men! So again, what the hell are you talking about?
t1_dupjf28	0	*	If that was actually considered the proper way to greet someone, and it wasn't sexual in nature, then why not? Obviously, that isn't the case in reality, since you're completely making this all up.
t1_dunao8n	0	*	>Every line of thought is a foolish fairy tale that we tell ourselves.   No. Some of our thoughts and ideas are based of fact, science, history or lived experience. None of which are fairy tales.

t1_dsyjnek	0	*	4 Repubs broke rank to vote nay. 51+5 is 56. 56 + 4 is 60. Your move

t1_du5s72x	0	*	China doesn't arrest people for talking shit about the government. That's US propaganda. China and the US are similar in that they'll get you if you plot to overthrow the government. 
t1_dtm4gx1	1	*	> Trump is just under the impression that coal is ~~the future~~ money.  
t1_dtm595o	1	*	How is that?

t1_dtm58xz	1	*	How is that?
t1_dswlv9h	0	*	heh you don't rule several nations by being having tea parties and biskets. 
t1_dsxcggh	1	*	Sorry, but why is that insanity? Or are you another blind Trump hater?
t1_dsyp7wa	0	*	Youre still here too? 
t1_dsx42sn	1	*	Because your opinion is interjected where it is not needed. 
t1_dswjycd	0	*	That probably explains your stupid question then.

t1_dswralu	0	*	You can't expect to wield supreme executive power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you!
t1_dsxsl47	0	*	The spaghetti incident is similar to the pineapple on pizza debate.
t1_dsygwaa	1	*	Ahahaha that's a good one
t1_dsxd1aq	1	*	Because she knows one slip of the tongue and her family gets the boot
t1_dswsw8d	0	*	Yeah even Australia is very similar to Canada. Way more similar than the US is to Australia
t1_dswzw8a	0	*	And increase your workload more by training even more people, instead of just 1? No i didnt miss it, you just havent thought it thru
t1_dtkq3xu	0	*	> its fairly easy to prove the government didn't collaborate  the Nation and State not just the government. There is a difference. 
t1_dtdnfd3	0	*	>Mueller hasn't laid out charges yet.   So those indictments were just pretend indictments?
t1_dsv6hj6	0	*	Im not drawing any conclussion.   They stoped publish it after 2008. Thats that. Why?  Ask them.   And if you cant. Learn it or accept that i give u the data inside it. 
t1_dsv8d3m	0	*	I love tourism. What I dislike are xenophobes like you who hate the idea of immigrants integrating into your Society. You're no better than some ignorant supremacist.
t1_duvxpl2	1	*	http://www.latimes.com/projects/oxycontin-part1/  i wasnt lying. read about it yourself
t1_duw7xyu	1	*	And that's why the party system needs to go away. Hardly anybody looks at people outside of the dem or rep parties. We actually might be able to change something if we did 
t1_duwg5g6	1	*	Remember after the primaries where Ted Cruz was on the phone for Trump?
t1_duwmgwp	1	*	I am being the change I want. As a critical thinker I often find myself going against the grain and I would not have it any other way. I will gladly forfeit my nose before my core ideology.

t1_ds3963r	0	*	What do you mean again? Israel has never been invaded.  Boycotts are global. Good luck fighting that.  Gonna force Europe to buy israeli shit? Good luck with that 
t1_duc6qnk	1	*	as you should :P
t1_dub0fs2	1	*	They execute more people than the US does in a year. China is very strict in maintaining it power. A lot of those jailed are dissents and corrupt officials. Also criminals, duh.
t1_dszrwup	1	*	Yep. If they cant afford to pay the employees  the employees who actually do the work  then they shouldnt own a business. 
t1_dszn13v	1	*	i actually expected an infowars joke, so you at least get brownie points from me for not hitting the low hanging fruit on that one haha
t1_dszmjxx	0	*	So I should boycott that kind of food because it's almost only sold by very conservative people then?
t1_dszk2hi	0	*	Yes 
t1_dt0c06u	1	*	You said your source said one thing.  It didn't say that.  What the hell happened in this country, that people don't know how to cite a fucking source anymore?
t1_dsziqn0	0	*	Businesses dont have nationalities anymore. Transnational corporations put an end to that 
t1_dszsmuy	1	*	I mean that playing football is not the only thing they are payed for. Like saying a mcdonalds worker is not just payed to make hamburgers and that is it. I wasnt declaring that is it...
t1_dszu240	1	*	You misrepresented the contents of your source, dude.
t1_dt1gely	0	*	I disagree there. Domino's where I'm at tasted like cardboard with toppings. Could be just because of different area I guess. 
t1_dt0097l	0	*	what does this have to do with creationism? lets stick to the facts. i know youre not used to that, but lets come a bit back down to reality. 
t1_dsztox9	0	*	If one company is far more efficient than another in making pizzas that is an entirely different problem, and has nothing to do with insurance mandates or the price of eggs in China.   
t1_dszu1ds	0	*	When the consumers were fine with it, he didn't follow through.  He was trying to bullshit the public into giving him a pass on insuring his workers.
t1_dt0drkw	0	*	Domino went the opposite way, they used to have just ok pizza 10~ years ago and had really step up their game since.
t1_dsznd1e	0	*	A lot of young people and high schoolers need to make a living wage. Anyone who has a job has it primarily because they need money. It doesnt make sense for a job to not offer a living wage.

t1_dsjizb8	0	*	Okay, I guess I will just dispose of the references I have used to gain my information and just believe you because you said so.
t1_dsjc14l	0	*	Just because there is misrepresentation of what a republican is doesn't mean I should change my views.
t1_dsjadnw	0	*	Just because X amount of people believe something, does not make it true. We are in the age of misinformation where there is so much information available to us, the truth is no longer relevant. 
t1_dsjaq1m	0	*	If your sole source of opinion is anecdotal people from a single website, I'm not sure you are one to lecture a person for focusing on anecdotes.
t1_dsjfxf4	0	*	None of this was confirmed in that video, in fact it was the opposite. Are you just going to keep posting this shit because you really really want it to be true?
t1_dsjfpb4	0	*	Soo....areas high in crime, aka dangerous areas. Idk what your point is here.
t1_dsj9y9h	0	*	The party clearly supports bigotry and racism. Their policies are cruel and harmful to Americans.   There is a clear difference between the two parties. 
t1_dsjiu4j	0	*	If someone gets too drunk in the US, the bartender can be fined/sued for over serving them as they have the responsibility of not letting people drink too much. 
t1_dsj8280	0	*	And a Democracy. They are both right.  It is called a Representative Democracy.
t1_dsjfk0n	0	*	So you are denying that you said something even though I quoted what you said? Bold move.
t1_dsjola6	0	*	any libertarian who thinks capitalism isn't inherently coercitive is deluded

t1_dsjgl4w	0	*	Oh good God. I am getting depressed just thinking about it. 
t1_dsj8qke	0	*	Yeah just let the government make arbitrary lists outside of the legal process which decides who can or can't defend themselves, great idea
t1_dskdjt5	1	*	Yes, that's much more complete than what I wrote.  Very nice explanation!
t1_dsjg0pn	0	*	They could save others but not themselves... Just kidding, they didn't save anyone.
t1_dsj952r	0	*	Yea like the turn out for the fcc repeal with celebrities on our side, corporations, and thousands petitioning. Im glad that went our way. Oh wait. 
t1_dsjtsn8	0	*	What do you mean by immigrants? Do you mean 2nd generation Turks who speak Swedish? Or do you mean so-called refugees. They're not the same, and people love to try to pull that sleight of hand.
t1_dsjyw0w	0	*	That would be a mistake of mammoth proportions..no one in their right mind within the White House would help enable that scenario.., surely 
t1_dsjbmnn	0	*	I don't think many people think no go zones means Muslims police waiting on the borders turning people away I think that would be ridiculous to believe. 
t1_dsjahnm	0	*	>  I can understand that might have been a bit too much for ordinary **Americans** to handle. ;)  ?
t1_dsjpmm4	1	*	You're welcome.  :)  I learned the difference a couple of months ago and I can't seem to help rolling it out at every opportunity now.  :P

t1_dsmvdsh	1	*	you have TDS
t1_dsjvuhj	0	*	You don't think it's pretty disingenuous to assert that transit = bad but living = okay? Would you say that Pripyat is not a no-go zone because you can pass through without radiation sickness?
t1_dsjn0us	0	*	Got it. So you want me to trust the same polling that gave Hillary a 99% chance of winning over the literal words of the SK leader. Sorry, cupcake, no sheep here.
t1_dsjcp9s	0	*	What part of the Constitution would need an overhaul?   Downvotes for asking a neutral   question that I was genuinely curious about...this is why nothing ever gets discussed.

t1_dsjey02	1	*	Thank you.
t1_dsjep1u	0	*	Unfortunately thats what happens when you watch too much CNN and other news outlets that coordinate directly with one party. They will be okay one day though. 
t1_dsjs89q	0	*	Oh thank god. Ive always wanted those small red states to decide how the rest of the US should live. 
t1_dsj8yef	1	*	I know exactly what it means, but clear the air for me instead of being a twat about it.
t1_dsj97ed	0	*	And under the Trump administration, we're becoming a Banana Republic.
t1_dsjjev8	1	*	You must not be familiar with the BBC?
t1_dsj9d25	0	*	No, it's not unrelated to ignoring their orders - it's the very reason that ignoring their orders requires effort and resources including time.
t1_dsjms55	1	*	That's exactly what I was alluding to.  Good catch.  :)
t1_dsjo7zu	0	*	OK well when you have something substantial come on back.
t1_dsm14y6	1	*	I'm from the Netherlands, living in Germany now. 
t1_dsjaswx	1	*	Also you can guarantee any revolution would be met with Russia taking advantage of it and invading Alaska.
t1_dsmdwwy	1	*	I agree with you that was also what I meant but I forgot the nuance
t1_dsjvz2g	0	*	My point was that he was appointed into his position, not elected.   Catch up.

t1_dsjgkle	0	*	Everything is imminent danger with a kid!  Again go have one and get back to me.
t1_dsjj300	0	*	If you have a public function, you lose some of those rights in the Netherlands. A politician denying a specifuc reporter or news outlet accessbecause they disagree with you would not fly here.

t1_dsjaz3w	0	*	You can't see what the majority of the US feels by looking at a online forum. 
t1_dsj8gjp	1	*	Read his thesis. He was mentored by Bannon, who I would pretty clearly classify as a white nationalist given his pride in giving the alt right a platform.
t1_dsjiz61	0	*	And you fail to realize that you don't need ISIS to establish a need for a no go zone.

t1_dsj7vlk	0	*	I think it was a point about which extremes actually get taken seriously in US media.
t1_dsjowfb	1	*	Unless the reclassification is based upon a persons country of origin what youre referring to is beside the point. And yeah I know what youre talking about. 
t1_dsjd3r4	1	*	As soon as he mentioned gerrymandered and electoral college, it was a lost cause.
t1_dsj53xm	1	*	**If I were**
t1_dsjcd90	1	*	This.
t1_dsjfw13	0	*	So, let me get this straight. You're attempting to convince me that the party I somewhat identify with is evil and stupid by insulting me. So that makes you and your party what then? 
t1_dsj9n6t	0	*	Sorry, no White House experience. I didnt think that would need to be explained.   
t1_dsjeowo	1	*	The Aryan race actually conducted European genocide on a large scale.    Today's Europeans are descendants of that mixing event.
t1_dsjprr0	1	*	It doesn't just include the fact, but also the intent. Intent is hard to prove.
t1_dskbewe	0	*	Yes I'm sure you never celebrate a patriotic holiday in any fashion in  your country despite being upset with the way things are run.
t1_dsjakrr	0	*	A steady drumbeat of propaganda for decades from a closed media ecosystem. That's about it, really.
t1_dskbegl	1	*	Large changes were triggered by the sort of people who now believe Trump will Make America Great Again.
t1_dt1zh6g	0	*	And the holocaust is a myth too, right? Are your parents siblings? 
t1_dt1vl70	1	*	Not saying that, but in South Africa, the white colonisers did keep slaves, is literally all I'm saying in response to someone not from SA who was claiming they didn't.
t1_ds7cq81	0	*	Fucks sake, have you ever smoked a cigarette before?

t1_du060yu	1	*	You're right, no is obligated to act mature. On the other hand, when people think you're the exact same as Trump, they're not obligated to care if it's just blowing off steam. 
t1_du1o91z	0	*	True, there's no need to be ashamed of things that we have no control over. People like to judge people for superficial things that they have no control over.

t1_dtcnzsw	0	*	There is hard science that proves we are going through a mass extinction even, no amount of paying for data has any effect on that, i'm shocked you could be this naive to be honest.
t1_dsb6ooe	1	*	What you suggested happened, is in fact the functional definition of a conspiracy. 
t1_dsju0yj	1	*	Can you source your original claim please?
t1_dumtm1h	0	*	We are in the middle of the sixth extinction level event and you think it is getting better.  Guess we will just have to wait and see one way or the other. 
t1_dum5wjk	0	*	Sure, but you still can't claim it *never* happens.  That's an absolute; the burden of proof is on you to show this.
t1_dumla7c	1	*	Do I have to add a /s for you
t1_dspn72v	0	*	Political unity is rare in a democracy. There are several countries that have separatist movements or highly aggressive political contests. Should we pull their nationhood status as well?
t1_dsq15td	0	*	I am not going to get into this with you.  You seem to have a chip on your shoulder.  But you can be Jewish and American just like you can be Polish or Italian or Spanish and American
t1_dsqgzme	0	*	>Unironically saying the victory has land right is comparable to murder of non-combatants and various other war crimes  Youre the unreasonable one in this situation. 
t1_dsorhzg	1	*	You do understand any upvotes you get here are from people too stupid to understand basic math right? 
t1_dsp6ls7	0	*	>  If motives matter always, when would be the right time?  Any time is good. Just pay the money or don't. Don't use the money to hold starving refugees hostage and blackmail the UN.
t1_dspnnti	1	*	The refugees are the ones living in camps in Arab countries, not the ones living in Israel 
t1_dspwbe6	0	*	> US  ? You mean the british?
t1_dsoodhk	0	*	No. I don't consider spending other people's money to be generous.
t1_dspfy14	0	*	Just because it's not convenient for the Arab losers and their Jew hating cheersquad does not mean it's not relevant. 
t1_dspu3ri	1	*	Then you'd hope anything before would be irrelevant by now too..
t1_dsor6le	0	*	Sure. A personal attack on me totally justifies the complete lack of consistency in your arguments.
t1_dtpkzqu	0	*	>I would fight for my country especially if we had a chance to overthrow a non elected gov.  They did. They lost. 
t1_ds2kpyp	0	*	By your logic the People's Republic of China is also not an independent state lol. That's not how it works.
t1_ds2az3y	0	*	Yes if you read my post you'd notice I already mentioned the mutual territorial dispute.

t1_dv4hoi6	0	*	Okay let me explain in easier terms for you you miss all the shots you don't take 
t1_dv1g6c3	0	*	> happened or didn't happen until proven false.   Wrong.  You don't have to prove that things don't exist.  The burden of proof is on those making the claim.  That's how the world works.   
t1_du5b7wn	0	*	Woah now youre sounding ridiculous.
t1_dur94yz	0	*	Well if one is too many perhaps we should also get rid of stairs and gravity. 
t1_dusdond	0	*	I thought perhaps a cursory knowledge ought to be enough to make an allusion is all. If I was wrong, then I have no way of knowing I guess.
t1_dur7p0a	0	*	Confirmed 0.002%, to save other redditors the trouble.  Though I disagree with this guy thinking one kid dying is proof that guns need to be taken away.
t1_dus7fpi	1	*	Also preferential voting. Here in Australia we use both (proportional in the senate only). 
t1_dut0q86	1	*	Yeah I mean you can get pinned mags and unpin them easily.
t1_durkeag	1	*	Yes that gun ban that had no effect on shootings, murders, and suicides
t1_durpz1a	1	*	Good point. 
t1_durmzub	0	*	Let's work on people, where the blame belongs.  How about a campaign to help kids learn to spot the signs one of their buddies is about to loose it? 
t1_durlkp4	0	*	You underestimate the creativity of the criminally deranged.  
t1_durlpjj	0	*	Changing our constitution to be more in line with the UK would be pretty ironic given its origins, wouldn't you think? The second amendment is a reaction to the UK.
t1_dur7ghb	0	*	What am I supposed to do? Wait a few weeks? By then another will have happened and it will be 'too soon' all over again.
t1_duurm33	1	*	AR-15s are restricted so can only legally be used at shooting ranges.
t1_durw18f	1	*	/thread
t1_dutl6yr	0	*	Except they havent.  And its really more like its just a matter of time. Its not even a claim that carrys weight either, seeing as people are just doing massacres by other means. 
t1_durheky	0	*	And yet the rate of mass shootings has remained stubbornly high. Can't imagine why that would be the case.
t1_durniac	0	*	More than you or any other European
t1_dutehg8	1	*	School shootings are a drop in the bucket. They shouldn't be used as a means to ban a weapon. 
t1_dusa14i	0	*	Yeah whatever you just said was a waste of data. Your opinion is dumb, please don't breed
t1_dus72h3	0	*	t_d is a strictly trump supporting sub though. politics says they are neutral but lets be real, that's complete BS. i've had many posts deleted for not being on the bash trump train.
t1_dutbf27	0	*	Lol. Like half the sheriff offices in Colorado sued the state to overturn the magazine ban and zero of them enforce it. You're funny. 
t1_durrh13	0	*	You sound like the salty one, of course though people like you can't be civil. Don't even talk to me if you're going to act like a rude little brat.  Typical convo. i have with liberals these days.  
t1_dusbamm	1	*	Similar issue in Canada with regards to regional ideals and politics.  Its very hard for someone from Vancouver or Toronto getting into the mindset of a person in Regina and vice verse.
t1_dursz37	0	*	Wo let's not forget the greens, votes 2.5 mil seats 0. Or the SNP votes 2.5 mil seats 54. Totally fair and Democratic system right there. /s
t1_durztr1	0	*	But why does that mean they know more? Wouldn't they know as much or less on average? 
t1_durgh9g	1	*	I just want to reiterate that point. Not only did the AWB have not measurable effect on overall violence, it had no measurable effect on *gun violence*. Let that sink in.
t1_duu2pkd	1	*	So...some kind of magic barrier around guns?
t1_durpqdz	1	*	I guess I could understand that if my entire idea of politics was dictated by tv and article headlines. 
t1_duranop	0	*	Well i dont care these kids died people die every day this was sad and all but everyone will forget this in 2 weeks
t1_durnyg5	1	*	Wow, it's hard to understand how such a big place can fall under one larger government. It's almost like we're the oldest continuous federation or something. 
t1_durr7jy	0	*	I'd say it's the media problem. They say the media hates Trump because he wouldn't cater to them but guess what? His rants give them endless fuel to run on. They secretly love the guy. 
t1_dut5def	1	*	You are a delusional fool.
t1_dus09md	1	*	It's called First past the post and only america, uk and canada still use it.
t1_dural6h	0	*	So amendments that suit you personally rather than furthering the development and helping the people of your country as a whole, got it.
t1_durr0up	0	*	Just remember that long and detailed posts aren't always right. I have to remind myself of that many times. 
t1_dursb8d	0	*	It is pretty well acknowledged and agreed pretty much everywhere in the states that the news does not accurately portray daily life for the majority of U.S. citizens.
t1_durlfpr	0	*	Well, there are 27, but the first 10 came all at once. So since 1789 weve changed it 17 times and one of those was a huge mistake. 
t1_dusce81	0	*	No, the Constitution does not grant rights. It enumerates the natural rights/liberties of all US citizens.
t1_durndjy	0	*	All of it. 
t1_dushbbh	0	*	Whataboutism at its finest   Good one you are using the play book effectively

t1_dusaxxa	1	*	Ohh. It's hard to detect these days unless it's blatantly obvious. [Poe's law](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe's_law) and all that, I just can't tell who's serious anymore.
t1_durjacd	0	*	> Literally  I don't think that means what you think it means, dear.
t1_durkzs3	0	*	I have C4 already. But it doesn't show how big my penis is like a assault rifle. 
t1_dus32js	0	*	Hey look an arrogant shitfuck whos correcting things I never said!
t1_duren6d	1	*	Nobody is pretending that.  It's a problem, and acting like it isn't is absolutely morally bankrupt. 
t1_durnmol	0	*	How about Mexico?
t1_durzykc	0	*	Somalia, Syria, Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Venezuela, Colombia, Turkey, Russia, most of South America, etc.   All countries with more restrictive gun laws, all clearly doing stellar.
t1_dus3zo0	0	*	What do you mean? 
t1_dur7sxv	0	*	Personally I believe we should allow teachers to concealed carry if and only if they have a CC license and take a state sponsored training course on active shooters and gun safety. 
t1_duegh7p	0	*	Those, nice subtle racism bro
t1_dudpwjq	0	*	Whatever excuses you have to tell yourself to hang on to your irrational hatred of everyone who's different than you.
t1_dudpp87	0	*	LOL  Bro you worked at the mall. It has nothing to do with liberalz being racist. You worked with most likely dumb young people.   
t1_dtwp8j7	1	*	*woooosh!*
t1_dtah0uf	0	*	Sure you were. You just happened to down vote all of my comments cause you know deep down that you weren't making a joke. 
t1_dua34fj	0	*	Those numbers are the process of ethnic cleansing.
t1_dsuw7yj	1	*	True dat. Im looking forward to seeing who the DNC puts forward next election. My money's on Booker, cuz the Bernie/Warren ticket kills donors.
t1_dupqdfj	1	*	If Ninoy was still alive, I wonder if he still believes the filipino is worth dying for?  Maybe back in the 70's that was true.  But now...we have become a shadow of our former selves.
t1_dv06hy9	1	*	I wonder what the Trump logo will look like on Guantanamo.
t1_duzh7yr	1	*	So...on another timeline America *is* actually great because of some kind of bizarro Trump?  Why is *this* timeline the N-Dimensional landfill for this dynamic?
t1_duzw9bm	0	*	These are his stories.   Dun Dun. 
t1_dv0tfjk	0	*	OMG!  I'm only 1:30 minutes in and have tears in my eyes from the laughter!
t1_dt1mmys	0	*	If your.. theory is correct why isn't Canada a disaster, like Mexico?
t1_dtk6j8v	1	*	But yet you advocate the building of a wall
t1_dt2j6x6	0	*	There will still be a border patrol.
t1_dt2igez	1	*	No I'm saying a border wouldn't be effective because of ladders, planes, and tunnels. 
t1_dui0uhe	1	*	There is an actual documentary though, people should really [check it out.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)

t1_dui0tyd	0	*	It's definitely not always the case but there are definitely people that are poor because of bad decisions. 
t1_dui1itk	1	*	Por que no los dos? 
t1_dui5d43	0	*	I've also wondered why we constantly strive to increase GDP for already wealthy countries. Do we not have enough already?
t1_dui37g3	1	*	that seems a bit dramatic for what I've seen. 
t1_duj7mj8	1	*	The inner city suburbs would be your best bet, Id recommend Moseley personally. Short bus journey from the city centre and Moseley village is a fantastic area for young people.

t1_duialze	1	*	I would rather say that there is a treshhold after which they will but its not yet met.
t1_duid50u	1	*	Flip phones are cheap, so are less popular Android's to an extent. Iphones and Samsungs are luxuries. 
t1_dui8gdo	1	*	I think this is the real answer. Things were just uncommonly good for a few decades.
t1_dui1lms	0	*	You're just embarrassing yourself at this point my dude. You're giving credit where it isn't due because of your love affair with a narcissistic con-man who has got you eating out of his hand. 
t1_duhxxog	0	*	I was being semi-sarcastic. I considered it after the US Army, but they don't consider you married until you're at least a Corporal.

t1_dui64jm	1	*	Thanks, feminism.

t1_dui0njg	0	*	Makes me wonder about that time Harry was riding a broomstick and caught the snitch in his mouth.

t1_dui7fd3	0	*	Whos they the cops
t1_duil43o	0	*	It's not really a discussion I like having because I'm pretty neutral on the whole topic, and it doesn't particularly interest me. Just winds me up the shitty rhetoric from both sides.

t1_dui0q87	1	*	I pay half my income in tribute to a multigenerational (land) lord because a magic piece of paper says the house he's never even set foot in is his because of inheritance.   
t1_dui0wc6	0	*	You're all socialists from this side of the pond.
t1_dui5ag6	1	*	I've never made that connection, thanks.  Always assumed it was birth control, which I'm sure is part of it since people still enjoy sex, but also other societal factors.

t1_dtt23ms	0	*	An absurd refusal to recognize reality.    Amazing!
t1_dtstllx	0	*	America is most definitely not a democracy in the strictest of terms. We are a republic with a constitution that enshrines a separation of powers.

t1_dttfexj	1	*	Eh, the Persian-Ottoman wars were nasty, with a lot of religious violence, population displacement, ethnic cleansing, forced conversions...
t1_dtt3vi5	1	*	Just the fact that there's an obesity issue with our poorest people says a lot in and of itself. 
t1_dtv5uda	1	*	He was also the Supreme Commander of The Allied Expeditionary Forces in the war against Germany.   The world was a lot different back then. Less than a decade after WWII ended.

t1_dtt6c9q	0	*	>its #1 enemy  That's cute.
t1_dttsp20	1	*	I agree with you, we have it a lot better in general, it's just there is too many factors to say that just because of wage. It is easy to take our access to basic survival necessities for granted.

t1_dtstuf4	1	*	I'm a Christian woman, and I find hijab to be quite liberating, to the point that I'm considering wearing it. I'm Mormon, so we're already expected to dress modestly. Plus, Mary wore hijab.

t1_duk6u7h	1	*	as I already pointed out, surface area grows slower the more water you have. You are saying we should have no stored water at all, because then none of it can evaporate.
t1_dunboko	1	*	Its true throughout the country. Corporate farms account for less than 10% of all farms.
t1_dukclt6	1	*	I figure if we needed it it wouldn't be terribly hard to set up. Steel mirrors focusing on a metal pipe filled with oil that heats up a still of water.

t1_dsf4zt8	1	*	Yeah I'm sure all 20 of them will really be ruffled.
t1_dsenq32	0	*	I'd wager he was richer than Trump.
t1_dsex191	1	*	Maybe it would be better to say that both are pretty well understood but we dont know what causes gravity. 
t1_dsergp7	0	*	Would it be possible for the PM then to be manipulated by his or her own party more freely with the threat of removal at stake, or does it play out very differently up there?
t1_dseueqr	0	*	Well, that's what happens when 3/4 of the country is overweight and 1/3 of that is obese. I'd say Homer is now a proper representation of the average male, including his weight...
t1_dsex90p	0	*	Nah it's the property damage, violent attacks, and push for communism that causes the hatred.
t1_dseq67k	1	*	fox is flashy, scary, and opinionated, of course people who are less easily entertained are going to watch it.  
t1_dsfd13c	0	*	How does that change the fact that Trump fired Comey for investigating ties between his campaign and Russia?
t1_dsenl55	1	*	Fear is unfortunately an excellent motivator.

t1_dseq2ao	0	*	You activated his trap card
t1_dsf0d5w	0	*	One is a consentual decision between two parties and grabbing someone is assault. The latter is way more disgusting.  And yes, it is gross that Monica choose to keep that cum stained dress.
t1_dsejzzt	0	*	Peace time?
t1_dso9gb6	1	*	Lmao. That's how you took my comment?
t1_du10yx9	1	*	If youre really trying to explain law to a Central Intelligence Agent you better rethink your life choices
t1_dts55er	1	*	Inflation and money supply are non-issues? It's almost as if you don't understand economics.  Thanks for playing.

t1_ds66ung	0	*	So....just to be super clear....you are not going to call out OP for making a baseless claim either?
t1_dunijpv	0	*	Yeah, if its cream cheese, why is there so little of it? What low-life skimps on cream cheese like that?   (I may or may not be a fat bastard)
t1_dunc4u8	0	*	Whoops, but still, paper is better than plastic in the environment
t1_dundss9	0	*	Fine, bitch.
t1_duont5x	0	*	your point being that as long as you get things exactly the way you want them without compromise, it's perfectly fine that animals are choking on them?
t1_duonnrn	1	*	nah, plastic straws wouldn't last that long.
t1_duonyq9	1	*	Bamboo straws can be cleaned fairly easily, they're a little thicker than regular plastic ones. I think you can even run it in the dishwasher as long as it's not the highest temperature.
t1_dungm62	1	*	I actually use Aquaphor, which is what they gave me for the surgery healing, and have been using it ever since.
t1_duqr7se	1	*	I'm completely okay with that. We've fucked up our planet beyond recognition (literally) at this point, its time that offenders learn what they need to do. If that requires penalties, good.
t1_dunk8zj	1	*	Ah just my National service in Finland II/15
t1_dunnai8	0	*	There are 1.4 billion Chinese, if there's 1% of poorly behaved population in every country, you will have a much higher change to see one from China than any other countries. It's just probability.  
t1_dunqag5	1	*	If you put ice cube in milk and drank it from a straw I would lose my mind hahaha.
t1_dunfqgb	0	*	I definitely wouldn't use a (reusable) pipe cleaner on a plastic tumbler straw. I'd be worried about causing microabrasions inside the straw. Sure it would be great for glass or metal though!
t1_dunv0my	1	*	Yeah, lets fuck up the planet and let our kids die with us.  I dont dont care if my live gets worse as long as my children and grandchildren get to live one
t1_dtu6vow	0	*	It is objectively is a lie. 
t1_dtuhf72	1	*	That's true. Though if I remember right, Ford's approval tanked hard after the pardon.
t1_ds7ekxf	1	*	What does that have to do with Wikipedia?
t1_ds7tneo	0	*	Oh yeah, nice come back. Like I've never heard that before.  Just because you don't like facts, doesn't mean facts are wrong.
t1_ds7emxa	1	*	Chinese in-laws.  They're all like a meter tall and maybe 3 kilos.
t1_ds7fmga	1	*	Sure, but your words made it seem like America is an innocent victim, and Pakistan the big bad monster.  It ticks me off when the conversation becomes so one sided.
t1_ds7s7e0	1	*	=)
t1_ds7jbeh	0	*	Also HFCS. But thats another thing.
t1_ds7qdyr	0	*	Why don't you like the regulation? What exactly is the reason? We need to stop using oil. I'm in favour of anything that might limit our use of it. 
t1_ds7t3yl	1	*	Am I having a stroke?
t1_ds7jbcc	0	*	Also HFCs. But that's another thing.
t1_ds7u25c	0	*	Referencing Hillary Clinton... That makes zero sense to me. I honestly have no clue why you might think that.
t1_ds7puqy	0	*	Wait, how will this affect the amount of fuel used in shipping the oil?
t1_ds84nsp	0	*	Yes, but that doesn't make it an invalid question.
t1_ds7w79j	1	*	Are you trying to ruffle my feathers? You aren't the cock I was talking to!  /Swedish chick
t1_ds7rumy	1	*	Also less fuel means less fuel means less fuel.

t1_ds7s3gy	1	*	Am I having a stroke?
t1_ds955er	1	*	Wells are still stimulated some times, as in acidized, but the permeability there is so much higher that proppant is not going to provide any benefit.

t1_ds7ou7i	0	*	I said repairing too slowly, as in wont be fixed soon enough to avert environmental catastrophe.  Not as in not repairing at all.
t1_ds7tl4a	0	*	You just averted explaining your position with a condescending one liner in your last comment, sooooo....

t1_dsq6zxd	0	*	You're just moving the slider on the probability scale. You might find 20% on the high side but if that was my kid, even 90% would have been too low.
t1_dt8dm3s	0	*	actually you're right, but the point still stands.  The US isn't insulated from foreign consequences 
t1_ds48pft	1	*	They are NATO members so there will be no land grabbing attempt by Russia. They will naturally continue with provocations but they know the cost of acting in the baltic states would be too high.
t1_dumc6xk	0	*	Really? Where's your evidence?
t1_dukovpc	0	*	Tattoos for children are in fact illegal, but if they were legal, so be it. You can deplore the parent's choice, but you can't interfere with it given that theoretical situation. 
t1_duie6fo	0	*	Every study done says that isn't true.  People circumcised as adults say there is no difference.  But you believe what you want to believe.......
t1_duma6zh	1	*	I'm glad you agree that you are a vulgar old man.
t1_dueepjy	0	*	He could be the least popular pope of all-time amongst Catholics, and it would validate your argument how?
t1_due753i	1	*	Nothing about rape, slavery, God-ordained murder, animal sacrifices, animal abuse, polygamy, incest...  But you curse God ONE TIME and it's Hell for you.
t1_due8yk0	1	*	Of course it would need to be written down.  The old testament was fine with rape. And slavery. Old testament god is a pretty shitty god.
t1_duemizz	0	*	An analogy is asking your teacher how to spell a word vs asking someone who is looking at that word in the dictionary. Both are good sources, but one of those is more or less infallible. 
t1_duyb4j2	0	*	There are definitely sport shooters in Sweden and Norway that use other types of guns. Source: Used to be Swedish amateur sport shooter, still know a bunch of people who shoot.
t1_duxi65t	0	*	Absolutely.
t1_duxhnv1	0	*	I do understand. But your original point is wrong.
t1_duxybjl	0	*	You don't know much about what I want to do or not. 
t1_duyio0w	1	*	Right, and it's a bad idea, even if it is relatable.  
t1_duynege	0	*	Yes I have
t1_duyycbm	0	*	Its not important to *you* that doesnt mean its not important to other segments of society.
t1_duyr46j	0	*	This, right here, is why the justice system was created.  
t1_duxgfxq	1	*	You do have to explain that, if you make an emotional appeal to mass shootings in the same breath as denouncing those doing the same appeal for terrorist attacks to achieve the opposite effect.
t1_duz8l57	1	*	What makes a semi-auto unethical then?
t1_duz1svo	0	*	But less damage than with a semi auto. That's the point of the ban.  I wouldn't call it a knee jerk reaction. Took them 4 years to decide on it.
t1_duyisvv	0	*	No, just because you're not *the leader* on morality.  You're just another country, like any other, and don't really get to decide for Norway or the US.
t1_duxpqy6	0	*	Are you saying the United States Virgin Islands are not American?
t1_duyuvrh	0	*	I'm sorry mate but the days where an armed uprising would work is way gone.  The only way you'd stand remotely a chance is if the military mutinied.
t1_duy0aow	0	*	Looking up the chain it doesnt seem so. You were talking with a swiss guy about laws in norway.
t1_duyb6s7	0	*	Yeah I take it it's New Zealand based on your username.  I would imagine our landscapes are somewhat similar judging from all the Lord of the Rings I've watched.
t1_duypf2n	0	*	Germany, Italy and Spain are the majority of Western European governments now?
t1_duxzmq8	0	*	Thank you for acknowledging your mistakes.  That was very big of you.
t1_dv0bqmj	0	*	Good job, you missed the point.  Paranoid american nutjobs piss me off 
t1_duym3o6	0	*	> I'm an extremist for wanting to keep the gun laws as they already are?  Yes! Because gun laws, as they are, are extreme. 
t1_duynafg	1	*	Thanks! 
t1_duyol1x	0	*	Maybe it's telling that you see your relationship with your government as one of subjugation, but I have no such feelings regarding my government (whom I do not support, mind you). 
t1_duy7o46	1	*	All I'm saying is that I think it was the media situation around the case that stopped them from ending it early and not the guns.
t1_duyl10k	0	*	Okay, so you're saying we also shouldn't find a cure for aids because relatively few people die from aids?
t1_duxy1jv	0	*	The problem is then you have all these issues with Acid attacks or other things that can be used as weapons. I am a lot less scared of a pistol than acid or a knife being used against me.
t1_duyfiiq	0	*	[First hit on Google](http://otbfirearms.com/nfa/transferable-machine-guns/). It's like you're wrong and don't want to learn any better.
t1_duxo1ix	0	*	(NB: the most recent spate of gun bans in the UK had no effect on gun crime rates.  Gun crime is higher today than it was in the Victorian era of liberal gun laws and crushing poverty.)  
t1_duyh0y8	0	*	My google bubble must be shite. Thank you! 
t1_duyt59w	0	*	Well that's your first problem. A federal concealed carry law would be a great thing.
t1_duyfxtn	1	*	Actually they are to fight the police that in these situations always side with the current regime where as the military tends to support the people for the most part, see: Russia 1917.
t1_duyp472	1	*	Serving is not a source for a hypothetical conflict, but I'll take you at your word and drop it. You're saying what I'd love to believe anyway.
t1_duxz4gz	0	*	Naw, Swedes are cool.
t1_duxnhbp	1	*	Haha, I think I remember that. 
t1_duxhm5p	0	*	Being an island nation probably helps as well.
t1_duz3x60	1	*	You're literally entertaining a tyrannical US government as a possibility.   Stupidity is out the window
t1_duyikpn	0	*	Well there it is. People like you. You know nothing about me.
t1_duyihz9	0	*	Which is what I said - protracted insurgency. That's not victory.
t1_duycjcn	0	*	Maybe, but if my stove had already caused a couple sparks that burned the carpet can you blame me for wanting to change it?
t1_duxllke	1	*	Well they aren't doing that though, they are using guns. 
t1_duyxnzx	1	*	You're delusional.
t1_duxq6d4	0	*	The UK has 15 times less guns per person than Germany, yet the only noticeable difference is in 5.6 times less gun suicides.  
t1_duyizaw	0	*	When did realism become important in this utterly ludicrous and fantastical scenario of the US Government declaring war on its citizens? 
t1_duymo6u	1	*	Basically what /u/athaleos said. I know a couple gun owners but they're heavily in favor of even stricter gun laws.
t1_duxozxx	1	*	It didn't cause everyone to be ok because they saw what was over the horizon. Same as now.
t1_duycqtj	0	*	That's literally what pretty much every 2A defender keeps saying. 
t1_duz8rbn	1	*	During actual warfare you mean?  Kinda different than the idea of civilians fighting their own gov 
t1_du90c2p	0	*	If I have less than $90 it is not normal or common for me to tell people that I have over $90. That is called lying, not rounding.
t1_du9jz4o	0	*	Great job suggesting they privatize when the only flaw of the Canadian system in this very OP is that procedures are universal but prescriptions are privatized and shitty
t1_du99fr2	0	*	I am going to assume that you dont live in America, since what you are saying is so completely wrong that you must be living else where. 
t1_ds9xysn	1	*	He's being dumb, no nation has wholly unrestricted free speech.
t1_dsaelmn	0	*	Because it's a republican seat and they have a say in who sits in it. Even after someone is elected.
t1_dsf2qtk	0	*	Wtf how are people this dumb, free speech isn't universal in ANY country 
t1_dsab0l2	0	*	So they are partisan?
t1_dsf2f3v	0	*	Anyone who's not dumb enough to look up basic facts? 
t1_dsacfpn	1	*	Oh how those goalposts move! So you admit that Assange was *literally paid by Russian propaganda*, yes?
t1_ds9pnse	1	*	Can you speak completely freely in America?  Oh wait you can't.  By your very own logic, it's also banned in the US then. Congratulations. 
t1_dsf2nfo	1	*	 Every single developed country has in some form laws to prevent insults, usually we call this diffamation, libel or harassment, nothing new at all. 
t1_ds9un8m	0	*	Granted, it is always easy to make baseless accusations with no proof.   Care to link to the Wikileaks email where Hillary admits to murder?
t1_dtjqtu4	0	*	The .99999... thing will start making more sense once you study set theory. 
t1_dtk6cnc	0	*	Before I provide counterpoints, I have to ask you, how old are you? Because depending on your age, I will have to provide different answers
t1_dtjpopc	1	*	Evolution *is* a theory, but people don't understand what theory means.
t1_dtjq36k	0	*	OR, and stay with me here, it's a fucking joke.
t1_dtjnqog	1	*	cant argue with that
t1_dtjpqja	1	*	Haha fair
t1_dtjxsm8	0	*	The idea is you'd sell the fake shit at lower prices, so it would make the real poachers stop when the price go down so much it isn't profitable.
t1_dtjm44j	0	*	>That just makes them stupid, too.  No, that just makes them stupid. Not stupid also. They actually have access to the information that disproves their point.
t1_dtjnqwk	1	*	it's almost as if it's meant humorously. 
t1_dstkorw	0	*	I wonder if they have to put em in their snizz sideways. Ya know, since they're asian
t1_dstdz7s	0	*	Yes, there are.
t1_dstzpv6	0	*	Snukes... Snu...  Death by SnuSnu!
t1_dsti2ta	1	*	is that enough or do you want more?
t1_dsthpag	0	*	Cool guy here. Basing someone's intelligence on the 0.000000000001% of their life you read.

t1_dstju68	0	*	Is that from the Special Olympics?
t1_dstht5x	1	*	i know

t1_dtlbnsg	0	*	If it helps you sleep at night 
t1_dtmfbto	0	*	Germans and Japanese put considerably less effort into blowing up their own infrastructure.
t1_dtlnsyx	1	*	Which is sort of another reason people become terrorists 
t1_dtnrqse	1	*	KSA is the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
t1_dtky4m7	0	*	If you see no way to act you have blinded yourself. 
t1_dszebtu	0	*	But the left does not use disagreement with that viewpoint to try to stir up fear and call for ending the Catholic Church.  The right does try to stir up fear and calls for ending Islam.
t1_ds38ljd	0	*	I'd say him being behind 9/11 is the reason we started a war.
t1_ds33js0	1	*	I see.  I thought it was because Afghanistan was hiding and helping Al Qaeda, who was waging war on the usa.  But your incoherent brown people rant is equally rational.  /S
t1_ds32t34	1	*	100% agree, look at him complaining even when Pakistani intelligence agency managed to rescue the American hostage....
t1_ds3p6sc	1	*	China would never let US invade Pakistan though.
t1_dtmad3f	1	*	llama llama duck
t1_dskwnpv	0	*	No, and I never disagreed with that. However, you would need a little more knowledge than being on site 3 years during a time of War to make a statement like they've been shitholes since Christ. 
t1_dskxd5e	0	*	It matters in the context of Norwegians moving to the US to be with Norwegians that aren't remotely Norwegian. 
t1_dssv8sy	0	*	I speak absolutely no Welsh, but while I have only seen Cymru written, google translate gives the same translation for Gymru. 
t1_dst382h	1	*	Lmao typical. That always happened to us in my school district near Austin. My mom stayed home from work yesterday bc the news said a quarter of an inch ice was expected...

t1_dsskf86	0	*	That's a long term goal of mine. I'd happily trade you :)
t1_dssfj16	1	*	It was 4xb0 with the wind chill this morning. I opened the door to let the dogs out and they both just stared at me and went back to bed. 
t1_dssl2z9	1	*	Ummm yes the fuck it did today. We definitely got drizzle around 5am this morning. The overnight temp was 27 degrees(im not going to convert this to whatever units other shithole countries use)

t1_dsdssn4	0	*	Look up the EU charter, google isn't hard. 
t1_dsdraw8	0	*	Yes, I heard of that.  We are talking about fucking No-Go zones though. A jealous teen stabbing his girlfriend, tragic and vile as it is, is not an indicator of that.
t1_dsqmp0b	1	*	Fair enough.
t1_dsoj6y4	0	*	No, Ireland is Ireland, northern Ireland is northern Ireland. Now bug off with that little englander nonsense
t1_dso7rr5	0	*	I wonder how many have gone into med school to prove that vaccines are bad.

t1_dso2vqp	0	*	It's not about the specific video, it's about the way people treat each other. There's no humor in other people suffering, at least there shouldn't be. I'm sorry if you think there is.
t1_dso5mt0	0	*	Incredible.
t1_dsqjtrc	1	*	haha maybe
t1_dsnw244	0	*	I'm not sure, I wasn't there. I'm sure there is a reason. Maybe its because he's racist. Maybe not. Its just bothersome how people jump to conclusions.

t1_ds6fx4k	1	*	Weird way to communicate, its like youre so consumed by memes you cant have a single coherent thought that originated outside of a meme format.
t1_ds6fv3o	0	*	They arent just right wing, theyre mainly pro trump. Important difference. And they probably could, I think it just annoys them to have to talk to non-supporters constantly.
t1_ds6rrm3	0	*	And what makes you assume that freedom of speech is more important than human dignity?
t1_dsa9t6d	0	*	So racial slurs and threats of bodily harm aren't hateful? Mmmkay...
t1_ds7515v	0	*	The recent FCC rules are just a example of the fact big companies can do what ever they want. 
t1_dsclfi4	0	*	says the dipshit who relies on media to tell him strawman fantasies like growing KKK numbers.   youre being radicalized and dont even realize it 
t1_ds6ikl9	1	*	But that doesn't make it right, nor legal.
t1_ds7iin5	0	*	You should get a job in the government
t1_ds7x9e3	1	*	You're certainly not the first liberal to be alienated by the modern left.  Half of the Waking Up podcast and the Ruben Report are about exactly that, for instance.
t1_ds6ogjj	0	*	It was his first comment, he probably chose it for this occasion.  *Zuckerberg, is that you?* I hate what you've done to our planet.
t1_dsa5wuc	0	*	Like what?
t1_ds8wj7q	1	*	he supported full communism too; the anarchists he fought alongside were anarcho-*communists*. Full communism is a classless, stateless, moneyless, international society, not Marxism-Leninism.
t1_ds6uq80	0	*	Ones work and ones job can be two different things. My works don't bring in an income, my job does.  I do derive pleasure from my work, not my job.
t1_ds7idbd	0	*	Did you read the whole comment chain?
t1_ds6daj5	1	*	The hilarious part is Germans can never accuse someone of anti semetism because that's like trump calling someone a liar. 
t1_dsa0dcw	1	*	so if they say they are socialists but act as capitalists, they are socialists? cool thanks  lets not even discuss the fact that anything they've said is remotely socialistic
t1_ds6igln	1	*	This is a great comment and I hope Elon fanboys take it seriously.  He's a piece of shit.
t1_dshn31m	0	*	Ouch. Can you take an extra week unpaid? Is there a Christmas closure too or do you use your week as normal annual leave and no actual summer holiday?
t1_dsi6u0c	1	*	No, forcing me to join a union when I don't want to is fucking me over.
t1_dsi85bi	0	*	Mm, no, its something a small subset of businesses are *choosing* to do.  You think the ONLY way they can possibly stay in business is to extort money from their employees pockets?
t1_dshmywn	0	*	So you get no PTO for the first year? That seems harsh, even for the US.
t1_dsidbkh	0	*	It disturbs me that it is seen as both common practice and a good thing that you can universally bribe bar staff in America into stealing stock/breaking licensing laws for you.
t1_dshqdll	1	*	Someone is bribing all our Wal-Mart people, our democracy is under attack! 
t1_dsim9rk	0	*	In some US states employers can only fire employees with just cause.  Doesn't that mean they are not at-will?
t1_dsi7tgq	0	*	You absolutely nailed it. I've been called a scab for working jobs where there wasn't even a union I could join. Doesn't matter. Not in a union=scab=fuck you.
t1_dsisfzw	0	*	Because you know when business are free to exploit people they dont right? See sweatshops and slavery.

t1_dshnme4	0	*	And then there's Germany where I wouldn't even accept a contract without at least 30 days paid vacation.     And imo even that's not enough. 
t1_dshutk4	1	*	That's because it comes from a early fremch socialist's plan to end unemployment, which was intentionally scuttled to discredit the left durring the second republic.
t1_dsi7yp7	1	*	Classic Puddy
t1_dsrgkus	0	*	Not at all. If you not want to pay taxes, dont earn any money. It is up to you. Or leave and go to your right wing heaven.

t1_dsi1r6j	1	*	no, but they may not get a cold 2litre ;)
t1_dsic981	1	*	Or adding hands money passes through until it gets to my server increases the probability of someone else taking a cut.
t1_dshi35s	1	*	Holy shit.
t1_du9wbpl	0	*	Please attack soldiers on duty multiple times while inciting violence in the media and tell me how it goes.   I would love the story you tell from your prison cell in any country on earth. 
t1_dtwru0l	1	*	Nobody will do it.   You're talking about the economic equivalent of launching a nuclear weapon at another country.   You're giving thinkprogress.org too much credit.
t1_dtwoqrr	1	*	Relevance to the conversation?
t1_dtvwodm	0	*	Its called the green climate fund.  You should seriously read up on it if you intend to discuss the topic 
t1_dtvry35	0	*	Didn't even read the whole thing. I just like pissing off random Internet idiots. Especially the pseudo smart ones lol. You're the one wasting time with the huge replies. 
t1_dtwoy39	0	*	That's not necessarily a bad thing. If the policy creates $1B more growth then both sides come out ahead.
t1_dtvqn1o	1	*	O sorry, it's a saying. I isn't know you from Adam just means I don't know you :)  Probably an English saying, hence I shouldn't use it in reddit!

t1_dtvrzex	0	*	In the US, the only reason our population is growing at all is due to immigration.  Feign outrage more.
t1_dtwla5z	0	*	Do you think the backlash would be better or worse if he agreed now backed out later? 
t1_dtvavzr	0	*	I'm not sure equating capitalist status symbols to socialist unions is such a good analogy.
t1_dtvgo85	0	*	Yeah, I agree on that the treaty isn't very substantial. Not signing it should have consequences, but lingering and grandstanding over it as if it's the missing keystone isn't going to do much.  
t1_dtwfebc	1	*	This is what you said:  Trump literally speaks in favour of breaching basic human rights  What does an article prior to him becoming president have to do with the context of the discussion? 
t1_dtvrsni	0	*	>what individuals do with their money  Matters the most because it shows which country virtuous the ones who voluntarily give who the ones who give visas taxation 
t1_dsrtuga	0	*	Just this one bad hombre I know. 
t1_dtvilmj	0	*	I think its misleading and adds to prejudice by adding to misconceptions.  I personally wouldnt add to Jewish anti semtism by calling it that.
t1_dttfnex	0	*	Text messaging parental approved contacts sure is risky.
t1_dsxft67	1	*	LOL, what's it like living in a bad Tom Clancy novel?
t1_dsxfwy9	0	*	Who did I call a shill?  I referred to pr types afoot, but made no direct accusations.  If I did, by all means link to it broseph.
t1_dsxicuv	0	*	when the democrats vote on a party line to not have a freaking 4 page document released, *you* KNOW the reason why.... does the wool also cover your ears?
t1_dsxdl9z	0	*	That may be true.   But that's a whole different ball game from claiming this story is nothing but Russian propaganda. 
t1_dsxgbav	0	*	The guy you're arguing with is an imbecile who doesn't understand the difference between a blog and news.
t1_dtq5d9m	0	*	Yes, I suffer from chronic assholism. It's an incurable disease. Or is it? I guess I'll need to walk down the road to get a free consultation from my healthcare provider to be sure.

t1_dud8cme	0	*	You don't think private property should be a thing? then let me barge into your house and borrow all your stuff. Hey its not yours, there is no private property.
t1_dud0icm	0	*	The solution isn't to enable it, it's to harness it in such a manner that benefits society. 
t1_dud8841	0	*	in practice that never happens. You *could* have communism on the scale of a village, but much more than that and it just doesn't work, as someone eventually seizes power
t1_duncks6	0	*	Which is exactly the issue, the idea that the issue dies with the gun. Gun control is treated as preventative when it is actually reactive but isn't as strong as supplying defense 
t1_duni161	0	*	There is no Trump quote for specifics - but he is referencing this discussion, where the specifics are outlined. Sort of like how Muslim ban is not actually a Muslim ban.
t1_dtf8enh	0	*	Pretty sure this is not written down anywhere except maybe the new version of the Dublin treaty which does not apply to Canada or the US.

t1_dsbw724	1	*	Yes you are it's hilarious you think that. 
t1_dsdg1dz	1	*	during ww2 U.S. profited much selling their products to people in war and that's what projected them to their superpower role.

t1_dsbole6	1	*	No ones buying your shit, you just look horribly out of touch. 
t1_dscoivd	0	*	So youre saying that America misjudged the fight they were in. Pretty big fuck up militarily and probably why you have a reputation for that around the globe. All the gear, no idea. 
t1_dsbuewd	0	*	Considering the well documented evidence of coup engineering, and consolidation of power to install a puppet government, I ask you what is the difference? 
t1_dsc6acc	0	*	Maybe intact is the wrong way to put it.  Let's try Looks better than other besieged cities in Syria, civilians are able to return, and certainly looks better than rebel held parts of Aleppo.

t1_dt7rd2v	1	*	Ah thank you, indeed, I guess that makes sense now. Living in a country that suffered from a U.S backed dictatorship I was always (well, when old enough to understand it) aware of that.
t1_dt7j51s	1	*	North Korea and China fought the UN forces as allies during the Korean War. It was the PLA that invaded and occupied Seoul the second time the city was captured though.
t1_dt7axji	1	*	Not really, English and Latin are both Indo European. Maybe English to Malay because Malay has a lot of English loan words but is unrelated
t1_dt79moy	0	*	There will never be free movement from NK to SK.  They'd never freely move BACK to North Korea.

t1_dus0j7b	0	*	The reason why Idlib province was taken in the first half of 2015.  A huge influx of TOW's and other atgm's were provided by the west .

t1_dus66a2	1	*	Is it really? Ive never heard that before. Ill have to look into that
t1_dusg5mn	1	*	Even if you're not, your own nation's military will have interpreters and courses to become one. It's an important part.
t1_dus4tiy	0	*	The pipeline is bullshit, Saudi would never allow a Qatari pipeline through its territory, and Iraq is in no state to have a pipeline go through it.
t1_dus22uz	1	*	That's more like it!
t1_dus8r65	0	*	Ok but why is it the responsibility of the US to save other countries from themselves at the expense of ourselves 
t1_dt5xij2	0	*	You realize that article is citing actual academic research on the subject, right?  
t1_dt4wu6o	0	*	The EU did the same two years ago.   China already ignores patent laws. What the fuck are you talking about?
t1_dt5f47w	1	*	That is why our government has to have policies that would distribute the windfall, yes? But out government is so shit that it can't even keep itself open. It's not on the trade agreement, it's on us.

t1_dt4psp5	0	*	Uh huh. Find me a peer reviewed study claiming NAFTA had a positive impact on median purchasing power then. 
t1_dt5adis	1	*	Indeed.  It's all give and take.  But a lot of the pushback to the TPP from outside the US was that they weren't getting much in return for the imposition of American rules.  
t1_dt5e8ax	1	*	Continual extensions of copyright term in the US seem to indicate that there's some appetite for at least copyright in perpetuity.  
t1_ds5p8h7	0	*	That's because your comment is ridiculous, because it is blatantly incorrect. All you're doing is insulting Pakistan, nothing substantial.
t1_dt492ya	0	*	My s7edge is in similar shape.  Can't wait to trash this thing. 
t1_dsyfc0g	1	*	They work in tandem you goof ball. A 12v battery doesn't output 12v at 20% charge.  A x volt lithium won't put out exactly x volts when the battery is literally DETERIORATING
t1_dt807as	1	*	It's called being obtuse on purpose. English is not my first language and I have no idea what you are trying to convey. 
t1_du604z0	1	*	They do it all the time. It's just smart people insults.

t1_du2x9h7	0	*	People are just going to have to get higher education, and education needs to be more efficient to help achieve that. Just like how we don't expect that 90% of people should be farmers anymore.
t1_dtzm3dx	0	*	Because you're not sure. Man, even fifth graders here know the difference between mass and volume ... and if they didn't, you could explain it ... so really the problem is with your intelligence.

t1_ds3bfpe	0	*	I don't get how they could think he's a joke and then he still gets the majority vote. It's actually more baffling than Trump winning somehow.

t1_ds375l7	0	*	That could be it as well. Dunno. I wasn't there. All I know is that the reporters called the NTSB when they heard the ridiculous names and the NTSB said, Yup!

t1_ds38vw6	1	*	It was actually already created in 2016, which explains a lot. Trump clearly saw it as a challenge from the beginning.
t1_ds5jyt9	1	*	 Oting for someone with the idea that they might change after you voted for them is a terrible position. But I guess I would expect no less from Trump supporters.
t1_ds2thes	1	*	Win is a decent approximation. Closer approximation would be Ngwee'an with ng prounced like the ng in 'sing.'

t1_ds3bz6f	1	*	Well, you can land a nice cozy job without your career ever taking off. It's called nepotism, IIRC.

t1_ds2y43x	1	*	I had a hard enough time with regular Guyen.
t1_ds3vtmj	1	*	I'm not terribly surprised to hear the quality is a bit lower, only because the first couple seasons were absolutely amazing. They set a really high bar for themselves. 
t1_ds31uco	1	*	I think it's just a turbulent area. Anytime I've flown from Seoul to the US it's been so turbulent over the Sea of Japan the flight attendants have had to sit until we were over Japan.

t1_duy5bs8	1	*	The ideologies that lead to those sorts of actions should be criticized just as much as any religious one. People are fucked up in one way, doesn't justify them being fucked up in another.
t1_duxtqy9	0	*	So youre expecting someone to do something, and the shaming them if they dont do what you want them to do? Ok gotcha.  How about you learn to respect a married womans decision?
t1_duxsv2q	1	*	Women can't go to most beaches without a bikini top though
t1_duxxzlc	0	*	Expected to and required by law are two different things. Again, according to social cultural norms, Saudi women are 100% expected to wear the headscarf.

t1_duzit91	0	*	It doesn't blatantly insult half of it's constituents. It just has a different view of how the male/female dichotomy relates to certain roles in the church. 
t1_duxocw5	1	*	So if you have armpit hair youre dirty?  Id really like you to try to explain your logic in that one. 
t1_duxlr93	0	*	I mean it seems pretty idiotic to criticize something you've literally never researched.   If you criticize a religion (any religion) without studying it, you invalidate your opinion.
t1_duxn9o3	0	*	Was this widespread?  I stand by my point though. It's at least true for most of the world. 
t1_duxxtdl	1	*	You're cute bro. I want you

t1_duxn4pf	1	*	A hijab is not a mask. Laws that dictate what people are allowed to wear are oppressive. Why are you afraid to admit that some women want to wear a hijab?

t1_dsizyqe	0	*	His sentiment is that no proof + no proof = proven? And the fact that there's no proof is actually proof? Do you not see why that is a shitty equation?
t1_dsii4gw	1	*	We play this song at work. I fucking hate that I know it.
t1_dsirnk9	1	*	That explains why they go against their own constitution to prevent Navalny from running, fucking puppet show democracy is what it is.

t1_dtskc59	0	*	I was thinking about the Attenborough episode where a group of lions take down an elephant at night. And Im pretty drunk and wishing dinosaurs were still around. Way cooler than animals nowadays 
t1_dts3y7t	1	*	For what it's worth I'm kind of there with you, man! I don't mind jokes or puns or taking the piss but it's the fact that it almost always gets upvoted to the top that bugs me.

t1_dv0mzy1	1	*	I think what he is saying is those 6 hours is when everyone in the office needs to be there.  So you can choose to come 2 hours earlier, 2 hours later or 1 hour in each side.
t1_dv12ipq	1	*	No, sorry, core hours might not have a universal meaning. I mean that you have to be in the office then. You still work 8h. (Actually 8.5h  incl. 1h break in my case, but I was simplifying.)

t1_dt3gppf	0	*	but u def are a hypocrite.
t1_dt3jmj8	0	*	He changed the wording and didn't say where he got the info from.
t1_dt3jhwf	0	*	We are not without recourse if monopolies do form. 
t1_dsceckm	1	*	Oh your right... two weeks
t1_dsq6ox2	0	*	Currently the Yuan is pegged to the American dollar.  They do some interesting currency manipulation over there. It's how they've become such a world power in manufacturing
t1_dsq8c1d	1	*	Yeah when they can guarantee absolute sovereignty and security at the same level the US can and can exist without the US markets call me. 
t1_ds1fsnr	0	*	Do you blow up cities for a living or are you just really interested in the subject.
t1_ds19vpc	0	*	No he doesn't because America has only been at the aggressive end of nuclear weaponry. The fact they got away with Hiroshima and Nagasaki is an outrage.
t1_ds13fnj	0	*	Don't trust it. Ever since Jeff Bezos took over, I've noticed the editorial slant significantly toward a pro-capitalist agenda.
t1_ds16g3p	0	*	Destroying a nuke should not trigger the chain reaction that gives a nuke its power.
t1_ds159ne	0	*	I agree. Its all about ones interpretation of what it means to cease to exist.
t1_ds16eu8	0	*	Honestly he could be a pepperoni stick at this point, as long as he's a pepperoni stick that's allowed to investigate unimpeded.
t1_ds14r4i	0	*	Consider Fallout 4 a documentary on how fallout affects Boston (although in the game a nuke hits southwest of the city).
t1_ds1d6yq	0	*	People forget that there are multiple interceptors per ICBM and therefore you can hardly claim 50% reliability.
t1_ds14yc9	0	*	Imagine if it hits the space station and that's how we are saved.
t1_ds1aqcu	0	*	It's OK. Most of them are recorded in Vancouver anyway.
t1_ds14t44	0	*	We would be so lucky to get hit with a bomb. Rebuild this city into something with sensible roads.
t1_ds13vcs	0	*	I think you should consider the ramifications of a failed Nuclear attack.
t1_ds16ahp	1	*	It's not a matter of left and right. Iraq literally didn't have nukes. That's not minor detail to be chucked around by a two party system.
t1_ds17s0y	0	*	The scenario in which the US nukes Canada?
t1_ds18zko	0	*	Mmmm pot-stickers. 
t1_ds2n53g	1	*	Haha guess you are right on that one. Reddit is a gem sometimes.
t1_ds31sv3	1	*	Yes, you continue to work on things after they are implemented. Would you rather have a system that is 50% reliable, or have no system at all? Then they continue testing to improve on the design. 
t1_ds24dz8	0	*	I'd say that's debatable. The Japanese government wasn't really showing signs they were ready to end the aggression without a full U.S. invasion occurring. 
t1_ds18ldv	0	*	Laser technology seems well suited to defeating MIRV systems. 
t1_ds14mub	0	*	Do they have the means to do so? How many is a lot of missiles in terms of fooling the system
t1_ds14ojc	1	*	I think it's a good bet. The radiation from the one that hits Boston will probably be a lot worse than any that blows in from LA, so I wouldn't worry too much about it.
t1_ds16frk	0	*	Something tells me the true answers to these questions is classified
t1_ds1xeoa	0	*	Wow, that was incredibly informative.  Don't see why you don't have more upvotes.
t1_ds1ai9m	0	*	It's the synths you will have to worry about, not the fallout
t1_ds1dfo1	0	*	Critical role!  I'd die.
t1_ds186dp	1	*	we would include you. 
t1_ds1e6da	0	*	Capitalism is too much of an ambiguous term, so I wont' endorse it or defend it. You can reword your comment with voluntaryism and I'm happy to answer your question. 
t1_ds6eeun	0	*	So the question why shouldnt we end it now? isnt the right one. We need to figure out *how* to de-escalate.

t1_ds1is9d	1	*	thank you for the thorough answer and link.  
t1_ds14roc	0	*	That's not how R&D works... but ok.
t1_ds197nn	1	*	I'm in DC, so I'm screwed no matter what.
t1_ds14li1	0	*	15,000mph isn't that fast.
t1_ds1b8qq	1	*	the window of descent is very very short, and the speed very high.that's what makes it almost impossible to intercept an ICBM.
t1_ds1in6h	1	*	At least you'd know you weren't missing out on any interesting new threads.
t1_ds2g3pb	0	*	Nah, as far as I can tell they've only ever threatened in retaliation for something (even if that something doesn't really deserve a bombing in retaliation)
t1_ds4h2kz	0	*	> well unfortunately i did address your earlier responses as personal, simplistic, and flawed;  Humor me.  Point by point.
t1_ds2q7c3	0	*	Left-libertarians tend to share our anti-state approach, but dislike our insistence on property rights.
t1_ds1m7gc	0	*	I am certainly glad he did not resist the UNSCs decision on that matter, yes.
t1_ds17wet	1	*	The number of ways that shit can kick off in that game...
t1_ds169j4	1	*	Probably, I think the Fukushima disaster hurt the west coast with fallout/radiation, if they detonated a large nuclear weapon on Los Angeles it would probably affect Boston as well.
t1_ds15kje	0	*	Just a wild guess that he's on the Trump train.

t1_ds2dva9	1	*	and?
t1_ds18ee8	1	*	If so, I've played enough fallout 4 to know I need a scoped pipe rifle and a mangey German Shepard and I'll be just fine. And lots of meth(jet)
t1_ds1bso2	1	*	I concur. 
t1_ds13n2d	1	*	The WP is unabashed biased garbage 
t1_ds1e6nu	1	*	Why would that be impossible? We've had vehicles doing just that since we started putting men in space.
t1_dt7ddcj	0	*	you are the internet troll

t1_dse0tw4	1	*	Says who? What does outdated even supposed to mean in this case? Didn't know that the concept of country is just a trend that you ditch when it becomes boring.
t1_du1u1ut	1	*	Well, once upon a time, there was this revolution way back in the 60s...
t1_du1nzf5	0	*	Indeed. The domestic support for the CCP is heavily reliant on its current economic trajectory. Once that slows down, political issues will surface. 
t1_du1xx0z	1	*	https://www.ft.com/content/e46e8c00-6b72-11e6-ae5b-a7cc5dd5a28c    Not much real research.   But as the author pointed out, capitalism is putting chains on democracy and vice versa.
t1_du2cs5a	1	*	I don't know about Japan they seem to be having a fuck foreigners nationalist crisis right now and immigration is hard as fuck
t1_du1r93a	1	*	The Chinese were in that position because, like every other country that went through industrialization and modernization, society was dogshit before it happened. 
t1_du21br1	0	*	They don't get shit for being called the communist party (china isn't even communist), they get shit for their horrible track record and brutal rule over the country.

t1_duc706e	0	*	That's a good little subject, don't question anything, sit back and be memorized by the glowing little rectangle that knows where you are and what you say at every moment. 
t1_duyn8um	1	*	Whatever your country's rival says is mostly propaganda, if they report something positive about themselves, it's definitely propaganda.
t1_dssy9yv	1	*	the iota dudes claim to have a solution  for someone who has no clue their solution looks ok  (of course someone with iota is sitting to the left of me and arguing)

t1_duy9amt	0	*	It kind of seems like its over if this is all hes got after a year of working. Pretty sure that he even came out and explained it all as well.
t1_dtttb39	0	*	What does physics have to do with missile defense???  Can't make this shit up.
t1_dsyeclv	0	*	Thats not a peer reviewed paper, its tripe.
t1_dseo7pg	0	*	Zero detail was presented in that article? Do you know why? Because talks have only just begun and we don't have any substantive information to go off of.
t1_dscnhb4	0	*	IE you don't have any cases. We're done here.
t1_dscgeap	1	*	I agree its unlikely, which leaves him trapped with his current regime, unable to shift very far in any direction without risking being destroyed, either by his own people, or by the USA
t1_dv3fbuq	0	*	\- wont stop lying 
t1_dv3qwou	1	*	Because the CIA and other intelligence agencies lie to the American people as a matter of course, as has been demonstrates categorically and with documented evidence over and over again. 
t1_dv3zoz5	0	*	Uh, people have been hating the Clinton machine for literally decades now.  They really, really don't need Russians to ninja down to whisper in their ears that Clinton's evil.

t1_dv3bpbw	0	*	Yea the one i was referring to says 25 year old woman on the rape by deception Wikipedia page but i sure she was younger too.
t1_dv41alw	1	*	No he didn't. This is the biggest lie sold by the press in this whole think. Almost no-one has actually seen what Snowdon passed to the press who have repeatedly posted what if's as fact. 
t1_due0j0d	1	*	In the event of war all control of those nukes defaults to the German military as the non proliferation pact would no longer apply. Germany is responsible for their deployment and use. 
t1_duepysx	1	*	They're made of wood now?
t1_ducqpn6	1	*	Yeah that's working out really well
t1_ducm2ra	0	*	The western front was rather successful, the eastern was the problem this time...

t1_dsr0140	0	*	No it wouldn't. It would cost 210 euros leaving tomorrow at 10.45 am (i.e. five hours from now). Would be even less the day after.
t1_dsqp9fr	0	*	>358.96 for a family of 4  That's for the whole family? Holy shit that's cheap...
t1_dsrxn8g	1	*	> Your whole argument is that the whole of Europe is similar to the country of the USA.  Point to any time I've said this.
t1_dsr6v6f	1	*	So?  What's your point?   You think their colonialism makes them good? 
t1_dsrz7yi	1	*	The food... of yellowstone?
t1_dsqz8vi	0	*	Idk how it's less notable, I'd argue roughly the same or more because the laws you are subject to in the different countries are going to be more drastically different than those between states.
t1_dsqftwn	0	*	right, but do you think italy has the same amount of internal tourism as the US? texas is begger than italy and england and ireland put together. get real.
t1_dsrkryu	0	*	You are almost right, maximum of four, so for a foreign family of five it would *only* be USD 160 on top of the 50 USD it costs to enter the USA.
t1_dsqvsfg	0	*	> I said the US has cultural diversity.  I would really struggle to find any other places in the world the same size as the US, containing less diversity. Except for Canada and Australia. 
t1_dsqgxm6	0	*	Way more diverse.  Can't believe a bunch of white people are trying to tell the most diverse country on the world they are to homogeneous.  It's offensive
t1_dsrshjx	0	*	So even though Americans have a tarnish image, they will probably be ok in Turkey? 
t1_dsr6mef	0	*	You might be ;) Haha. I meant in terms of documents needed.
t1_dsqzy23	1	*	> Meanwhile in the land of the free  The countries in Europe are more or less equal for quality of life (plus anyone can live anywhere legally in the EU)   Mexico has a VERY different QOL 
t1_dss7o1l	1	*	I assume these are mostly commuters rather than compulsive serial tourists.

t1_dsr01ob	1	*	If we're talking about hotly contested borders with lots of wars, it seems I might say Isreal/Palestine is a step above France/Germany. But other than that, yeah I get your point.

t1_dsqni1c	0	*	Now I may weird out all the americans in this thread, but you may spend more for that gasoline than for a low-cost plane ticket. Not even counting the fee for the highways.

t1_dtpux9a	1	*	That won't make a difference..
t1_dto9y6s	0	*	If you look at it from the other end, the US **has to** import people from all over the world to fill its universities, because US primary eduction is awful and doesn't produce enough bright minds.

t1_du94qk2	0	*	Yes, I'm absolutely for a zero tax rate on corporate profits.  That invariably means the income must be replaced with another source, or spending reduced.
t1_du89d1g	0	*	Yeah so if this guy only remembers from the Rudd years, is he only like 14 or something?   
t1_du8bi27	0	*	What if my goal is mass hunger, can I list all the communist countries that did that?
t1_du8ye2g	0	*	If we don't pass the price onto the consumer, there will be no profits to tax. Any thoughts on your answer to my questions?
t1_du886ww	0	*	And just as the gov can grossly mismanage, so too can private interests grossly exploit.  Sounds like were  having an accountability problem across the board
t1_du8a2gt	0	*	Its probably more being settled by brits. Since their colonies tend to be much more successful than other colonial countries.
t1_du89gt5	0	*	If you could, I'd like a source on that, as my googlefu skills are failing me early this morning.

t1_du97x0i	1	*	I don't think anyone is on for life. Mine runs out I think 2020 or 2025... At such time I'll buy a bunch of batteries and go off grid. Hopefully batteries will be better value by then
t1_du861c4	1	*	In that case, have a mighty fine day good sir!

t1_dv2plim	0	*	Jesus christ dude.  Go play outside. 
t1_dv2tsjy	1	*	Lol. This drama is so inflammatory and pointless.  I look at you the exact same way I look at Trump supporters. That's how fucking pointless, emotional, and misguided this take is. 
t1_dv2slbn	0	*	Great, did you understand anything I said though? You can just ignore the US and think that will work. Our economy still is 2-3 times larger than China's. 
t1_dv30pn7	0	*	That makes our great nation the taint...   giggity. 
t1_dv2rixt	0	*	So then Free Trade does not exist today, and all countries completely disregard all economists?
t1_dv2usng	1	*	You should really read up more on that tax bill. It does basically none of the things you claim it does.
t1_dv31i04	1	*	Yes, the past 8 years really showed the economy suffered hard without tax cuts... uh... oh, nevermind.
t1_dv2siv8	1	*	NAFTA isn't free trade by your definition though. The US puts large import tariffs on Canadian lumber, and Canada does the same on American dairy.
t1_dv2tu13	0	*	Deer Slalom?
t1_dv2i4js	1	*	The UK didn't thwart the independence vote. The people of Scotland did and continue to do. 
t1_dv2orrn	0	*	Democrats did not vote for Clinton because she's a woman. They voted for her because she is one of the most qualified candidates for the presidency in the past 100 years.
t1_dv30tw5	1	*	That is a good point. My personal theory about Canadian geese is that all the concentrated negativity that Canadians don't have was stored in your geese.
t1_dv2sebq	1	*	memes are murder.
t1_dv36w8u	1	*	Yeah, but that is then result  of voters instead of enforced necessity of the voting system.

t1_dv39fxa	0	*	>it was simply because the USA had a great distaste for communism  And I don't blame them one bit. There's a reason the communists had a wall that kept people *in.*  
t1_dv2u2gq	1	*	What planet are you from?
t1_dv2u7mt	1	*	Bingo! Removing any and all protections from crony capitalism will lead directly to it. It's a natural extension of laissez faire economics.

t1_dv2k917	0	*	An independent thinker wouldnt say Obama didnt do anything, because whether you like him or not, thats simply not true.  Edit: Dont bring Jesus into this. Thats a big problem in this country as it is.

t1_dudq5wx	0	*	Both are bad comparisons - that's the point.
t1_dudrdmm	1	*	I wouldnt call it a stupid argument.  Overly pedantic? Oh for sure. But the difference between a pyramid structure and a vertical structure is huge.
t1_due5vw3	0	*	Looks to be about 200 years after Spain's initial invasion.
t1_dudqsqa	0	*	Most slavery was for profit direct and indirect. Your observation reflects scale not any intrinsic difference in the act of slavery.
t1_dudqa1t	0	*	The only one I know whose legacy still affect many nations and society from the Americas to Africa.
t1_dudzn0q	1	*	Maybe you didn't see what I was responding to. The other posted made it seem as if the British were good and benign, that there were only a couple of misunderstandings. I sought to refute that. 
t1_dtuhv7w	0	*	Why it called a hung juryand not a hanged jury?
t1_dtun1yw	1	*	Oh yeah I'm not saying it's perfect, I'm just saying it goes a little beyond smart people being less pliable.
t1_dtutark	1	*	That's exactly the idea. It's almost impossible to get chosen if you've so much as attended college, let alone if you admit to knowledge of the law.
t1_dtumili	1	*	but it's better than nothing

t1_dtud1cu	1	*	I'm an engineer, and I haven't met many other engineers that smoke pot. We mostly drink instead.
t1_dtusamh	1	*	It is not okay for any person of any rank to lie under oath. Most politicians' lies aren't under oath and are therefore not a legal problem. We've had a president impeached for lying under oath.
t1_dtuknsa	0	*	If you get the jurors to agree, prosecutors cannot appeal a not-guilty verdict in the United States.
t1_dtuox3v	1	*	I wasn't comparing it to Germany. I was pointing out that your statement isn't actually indicative of anything in the US.

t1_dtvgeov	1	*	Ah, Ironmaning it, huh? Admirable.
t1_dsj38hd	1	*	Did we or did we not cut military aid?  We made the first step in cutting ties, they are just simply following up tit for tat.  But let me tell you, ive never seen a more fitting username.

t1_duvxgs0	1	*	You blaming Obama for reducing pollution? 
t1_duw0frk	1	*	In all seriousness, the most reliable way to solve this problem is by reducing the population of Earth.  We need to distribute birth control, globally, for free.

t1_dv1bgg1	1	*	Yes... 
t1_duwaxja	1	*	So make sure that gerrymandering ends.  Vote for another party.  Gerrymandering skews the odds of winning, it doesn't make it impossible.
t1_duwi2jn	0	*	Almost twice as much per inhabitant. It is just that there are more Chinese people than americans.
t1_duwbhys	1	*	Tragedy of the commons sounds like some stupid thing stupid people do until you're the one doing it. Then suddenly it's a simple concept to grasp.
t1_duwpir7	1	*	Maybe its the great filter. Maybe its just time to go 
t1_duvzesk	0	*	As does all of the west.    western nations, and in particular America and Australia have the absolute highest per capita pollution.  
t1_duxjzjz	1	*	You were right. We both knew you'd be right, but here you are, right.
t1_duxu59v	1	*	I am OK  Thank you

t1_duxf3hk	0	*	Oh wow ad hominem now huh
t1_duwycgr	1	*	Its not all boomers, but it certainly is a majority. A voting majority, at that. And yeah, its odd how you dont realize how fucked up your parents were sometimes until youre in your damn 30s. 
t1_duw0a8v	0	*	I mean you answers your own question. People still smoke two packs a day and eat like shit. Humans are terrible at sacrificing now for the future. 
t1_duwg3av	0	*	Literally everywhere on Earth is at greater risk for weather extremes. Floods, droughts, hurricanes and tornadoes will cause a whole host of problems and lead to a decidedly less comfortable life.

t1_duwsbyz	1	*	What **is** the point to not counting their entire rural population?
t1_duwbnhl	1	*	The ocean could recover and by sequestering CO2 in that manner it could buy humanity the time needed to stop fossil fuel usage.
t1_duwh6ct	1	*	Ah, no, that would be stupid and reckless. On an unrelated note, would you by any chance own an accurate map of Vietnamese strategic assets?
t1_duwa5ba	1	*	And a universe utterly silent of intelligent technological life is SCREAMING at us.   But we can't hear silence.

t1_dux7jsg	0	*	On the other hand, tories. >:)
t1_duwrc6p	1	*	Yup...we can't continue like this and it is unfair to tell developing countries to lower even more their standard of living just so a limited amount of people can keep consuming as much as they do. 
t1_duvxslk	0	*	$$$  also homo sapian's tendency to be irrational and self destructive
t1_duw4fao	1	*	They elites don't give a shit if billions like you die.  They have underground cities that could last centuries if needed.  As far as they're concerned, if you self destruct thats perfect for them. 
t1_duw1rrb	0	*	China, first and foremost, is practical. Their policies might not seem to be nice, they might not be even close to fair but damned if they don't always have a reason for implementing them.
t1_duw0fuo	1	*	Like country ham & provolone.. maybe throw in some Dijon-mayo.  Little, flaky, buttermilk biscuits would fucking *rock.*
t1_duwglc0	1	*	Expected nothing else. You downvote my comment becuase you lack a sensible answer.   Usually the case with your kind. 
t1_duwafxx	0	*	It's only cheaper though because gas in the US is massively subsidized. If gas was $8-$10 / gal like it is in most (all?) European countries, the calculation would shift drastically.
t1_dv0ztdl	1	*	Have you ever actually seen a map of The Americas before?
t1_duwb99b	0	*	US businesses may be researching a lot of the tech but the government and businesses aren't actually implementing it. What's the point in researching something if you're not going to use it.
t1_duwf84o	1	*	Because i favor freedom and liberty as a foundation of a economy over authoritarianism and opression?   Yeah, in that case, im very special.
t1_duw4ssi	1	*	Ah my misconception then. Thank you for the correction.
t1_duvzzyd	1	*	I dont think thats what he meant, he was implying politicians dont give a damn and arent doing it out the kindness of their heart.

t1_duwgtl9	1	*	yes it's normal but doesn't stop me from hating it
t1_duw4vt9	1	*	GREED. MONEY. POWER. Thats why the republicans dont believe in global warming. Or the theory that maybe just maybe 7 billion people polluting the plant isnt a good thing. 
t1_dux2f0q	0	*	But does that excuse Donald Trump planning to do the same?
t1_dvhgag7	1	*	Youre right, It doesnt matter. GDP is what should be used, that way you can compare the dirtiness of a country to its total output.
t1_duwqdsl	1	*	You are wrongfully in doubt. 
t1_duwxp6g	0	*	Are you sure about that?  Start reading history about 100 years before Mao came to power.
t1_duw3t18	0	*	Any advice for someone looking to get into a similar field? What you went to school for and how you found the connections in the industry can give me some ideas.

t1_du7cxlt	1	*	Your brother was gay before he was raped. Sorry.
t1_dv5si4a	0	*	I doubt we need a PR or political win against a terror organization.  There are many reasons to hate israel/idf, IMO that's not one of them.
t1_ds8iptn	1	*	Sure.  That was likely the author's intent (consciously or not).  It's much easier to celebrate the deaths of people you have dehumanized.

t1_duv18k4	0	*	so they will add no emissions through their 15 year grace period? 
t1_duuee0k	1	*	New Orleans is the result of idiots living below sea level.  How bout move in land outside of flood plains.  We'll learn though.   The survivors anyway.  There will be billions of those.

t1_duv1c44	0	*	Thats exactly my point. 1-5% within the 21st century is bad enough to be worst case. 
t1_duu7wr8	0	*	Well, sixty percent of the world's population is 25 years or older, so yeah. They're all likely to be dead in 60 years. 
t1_ds24nbr	1	*	There's a difference between mere verbal criticism and boycotting. Her decision indicates she is either a hypocrite or she thinks Russia is better than Israel. Those are the only two possibilities. 
t1_ds24j3c	0	*	Sorry, fake internet points aren't an alternative to a sound argument, no matter how many idiots disagree.

t1_ds283k2	1	*	I doubt that, especially if the Democratic platform keeps moving left.
t1_ds1yukg	0	*	Did you read the thought experiment or just ignore it? One side wants a genocide - thats not the side anyone should be supporting.

t1_dt4u9ch	0	*	Lmao, you're delusional. Show me some sources for such a dastardly wrong claim. Just admit Trump is doing great things for once. 
t1_dt2nqkq	0	*	Ok. It's 1
t1_dt2mdrz	1	*	Millions of people believing in something has no bearing on whether its true, if their belief is not based on evidence.
t1_dt2spac	0	*	Maybe. I've been a member of three churches in my life and none have ever ascribed to a literal creation belief. 
t1_dt2l7zu	1	*	I've always thought the real blame was on the art teacher that told Hitler he sucked   /s
t1_dt2kv12	0	*	What? I said its hysterical to believe America/Trump is comparable to Hitler. I called the guy who thought so a moron, why would I be agreeing with him?

t1_dt2o8y2	1	*	Yea, that's why there are all different types of questions.
t1_dt2mhx3	0	*	The only way you could bring this back is with some guy from one of the nazi oppressed demographics.  Anyone else would get a metric fuckton of bad press and hate.   
t1_dt2sucw	0	*	Honestly, the second just seems like a play-by-play of how the first went down...  I wouldn't say those are two different accounts whatsoever
t1_dt3tpka	1	*	That same thing happens in the UK too. Anti-Catholic bias is really prevalent here (and quite violent in some places).
t1_dt31epo	1	*	But why use the framework of one very specific version of creation to represent anything that set the universe in motion?  Anthropomorphizing things just muddies the waters.

t1_dt2oevw	0	*	> Where did I say all critics of the US are doing it to be edgy?  That was basically your entire comment. Edgy Europeans and even edgier Americans.
t1_dt3udf9	0	*	Well, all private Catholic schools in the UK are run by Religious orders. While all diocesan schools are free.  
t1_dt2jj7p	0	*	Let me tell you how part of US politics are like Nazis.
t1_dt2jv4x	0	*	You need to be able to draw people to go to art school apparently. I'm sure standards went down because of Hitler.

t1_dt3br0r	0	*	Is that a problem? It seems to work for most of the world.
t1_dt2tx8t	0	*	Im getting heavily downvote for this comment chain too.  My guess is that it is just people butt-hurt over their superstitions being insulted
t1_dt2mgz8	0	*	Well Im really sorry a joke hurt your feelings, but if youre gonna be on the internet with other people I think you should get used to it.

t1_dt2zs6f	1	*	That is foul.
t1_dt2jm5c	0	*	Being an art teacher is apparently very stressful.
t1_dt2jokb	0	*	It is. Democrats didn't control the 3 branches. And the shutdown didn't happen because Democrats wanted to deport people that came to America as children.
t1_dt46v35	0	*	Its the largest city in Denmark. If anything, the small towns are less diverse. And yes they do. When I was there everyone was blond, roughly 6ft, and riding bikes. It was pretty stereotypical. 
t1_dt32p4w	1	*	Yeah let's do a that did not happen but give me proof of what would have happened if that happened game. That's totally how science and debates works.

t1_dt3tog1	1	*	I think very little in America is done right tbh. 
t1_dt2o23d	1	*	I definitely agree with the hypothesis that the OT was compiled from a number of different sources, likely introduced in distinct steps as Judaism evolved to incorporate different peoples. 
t1_dt2mdf8	1	*	Would make sense because apparently he wasn't' satisfying anyone with his mini bratwurst.
t1_dt2pp4d	0	*	Saying faith based beliefs are ok does affect others, since laws are passed daily based on faith based beliefs. 
t1_dt2nygc	1	*	So which of our ancestors did Yahweh pick to be capable of sin, and did that person understand the concept?
t1_dt2p12d	1	*	Case was closed. Trump hoping to distract from his treason does the yeah but thing and has them reopen the CLinton investigation to try to claim somebody else committed treason. 
t1_dt2meuv	1	*	/s
t1_dt2muiw	0	*	I think you're reading that passage wrong. Saul stopping his attempts on David's life is as easily read as a temporary situation as it is he never ever attempted to ever again. I don't see your point
t1_dt2nzrm	1	*	Well man, I can honestly agree with you. I think shaking someones faith to the core is certainly inevitable. Its how people cope with it. 
t1_dt2mv2t	0	*	How are those different
t1_dt2of17	1	*	Maybe
t1_dt4ta7z	1	*	I started out talking about rash tweets. I edited in how butthurt this community gets when someone goes against the hivemind. Atleast try man. 
t1_dt2lirq	0	*	I mean, yah, if your a psycho baptist, then the two ideas are probably incompatible.  But even in the U.S., psycho baptists are definitely not in the majority.
t1_dt2md6d	1	*	No I didn't, I said you misinterpreted his reminder as an accusation.
t1_dt2spjk	0	*	wrong kind of plants then? Definitely not flowering ones. Also Sun was on 4th day AFAIK, plants 3rd. The fact alone that Earth was before Sun is kinda ridiculous.

t1_dt2pzig	1	*	For sure man, I think faith does not equal intelligence. 
t1_dudfj9b	1	*	Read those 50 links to primary sources yet?

t1_dsdbsxr	0	*	No, I m correct.
t1_duvloi0	0	*	Except we're not talking about theoretical capacity which I'm sure is monumental for AWS too. We're talking about how much is actually being sold to customers right now.

t1_dsba6cm	0	*	Do you find child rape a funny subject?
t1_dsbdqk3	0	*	What? 
t1_dsbhvt7	1	*	Probably because of the redneck stereotype that rural areas tend to have.
t1_dscc9n8	0	*	Yes it's the atheists trying to redefine marriage and everything.
t1_dtr4rd2	0	*	Yes. Often it's all for their children.  
t1_dtqb04l	0	*	lol god damn Ive never seen anyone get so thoroughly humiliated and keep coming back for more. 
t1_dtqu56u	1	*	I did not say there wasnt a major conflict. I said there wasnt a Syrian crisis because someone asked how many Syrian refugees were taken in then which is pointless. 
t1_dtqfmhg	0	*	Oh I see. You just don't quite grasp what you wish to articulate.
t1_dtqssjw	1	*	As to why the US shouldnt have a merit based immigration policy?  No.. Doesnt seem relevant 
t1_dtr3gwa	1	*	It's not you who's misunderstood. He didn't understand that we were referring to the guy who made the fake 72% statistic, who is most likely a russian bot. 
t1_dtqtxdn	0	*	> No offense, but the number to total immigrants the US takes in both illegal and illegal, on top of how many refugees we take dwarfs that.  The USA is 10 times larger than Canada...

t1_dtry3rf	1	*	Well, I can hardly argue with your well researched opinion.  Carry on. 
t1_dtsbati	0	*	Gotta make yourself visible and hobknob with potential employers and all. That makes some sense, it still sounds kinda crappy...but i'm not a microbiologist.
t1_dtqnt74	1	*	No worries mate, I'll check it out sometime.  Thanks!
t1_dts9l8e	0	*	What about diversity is good if there's a more qualified person with greater social utility available? Just diversity alone won't help with anything. 
t1_dtrdofu	1	*	He goes for the go read facts arguement when he posts to one of the biggest propaganda subs on Reddit. Yeah, not gonna argue with someone that hypocritical. I'm tired.
t1_dtql7on	0	*	I'm sure /r/the_donald posters post elsewhere too! Maybe also in kitty cat subreddits! Imagine that!
t1_dtqu7cu	0	*	So, the whole Low skilled workers are needed in the US argument??
t1_dtqd6p5	0	*	Where did I do that?  I'm complaining about people misrepresenting the laws of Canada in order to further their own narrative.
t1_dtrc4sk	0	*	4 years ago I moved to Canada from the UK easily, am not rich.  Maybe they just hate Seppos

t1_dtanbx8	0	*	Soros in his own words is disingenuous.  LOL.
t1_dt9zpjm	0	*	Fuck off for saying I was mutilated. There's a huge difference between male and female circumcision. 
t1_dt970wl	0	*	They are not equal in terms of actual physical effect (total removal of sexual pleasure vs partial) but they have moral similarities.
t1_dta1kod	1	*	Not all forms of female circumcision is removing the clitoris. THe milder forms (removing the clitoral hood or pricking the hood with a needle) are harmless.
t1_dt8wy8c	0	*	And to show the internet that you're sad you're circumcised.  But yeah, my comparison ... always could improve :)  Thanks!

t1_dtezcmj	0	*	Morally it's identical though.
t1_dtfcqs0	1	*	There is no objective way of choosing which lives are more important than others. It's up to your emotions. Empathy with a living, feeling thing is not a bad emotion in my opinion.
t1_dsf7fi2	0	*	I saved the comment because I endorse the post. What's wrong with that?
t1_dsf6ocb	0	*	My argument is that two wrongs don't make a right, neither side should be attacking anyone's children 
t1_dsfbjlc	0	*	You do realize there are actual countries who would execute the man on spot don't you?
t1_dum3i9n	1	*	I agree with enough of that not to argue any further. 
t1_dtn8oyk	1	*	You must not frequent r/watchpeopledie because Brazil and China are on there way more than anywhere else. The flip flop maffia is running rampant
t1_dto9uae	0	*	To understand the depth of the problem you have to  We can't just stop littering and polluting. We need to change our fundamental systems like fossil fuels, switch to solar, etc
t1_dv5e99l	1	*	he doesn't have a point.
t1_dv4l3se	0	*	Nope, but in the us you still need the proper permits for building anything
t1_dv4nagi	0	*	you said stun grenades are harmless. 
t1_dv4vvkz	0	*	Which can do terrible tissue damage and is not, for example, something you would want your own police to use against civilian. This is criminal.
t1_dv4yf61	1	*	Yes.
t1_dv53o2a	1	*	Since they're not military I don't know what rules they follow. IDF has a higher standard to follow.

t1_dv47o96	1	*	All lethal to a baby.

t1_dug4khx	1	*	Poor little martyr.
t1_duh3698	1	*	ok, you are a sensitive teenager 
t1_duftnys	0	*	What's our vector Victor? 
t1_dugdspo	1	*	That isnt what he said, he said older people are more likely to text and drive,  despite the fact that it probably takes more of their attention than it would for a younger person. 
t1_dufz2zf	1	*	Yeah, but if you read the rest of his pay that became quickly apparent.
t1_dufst05	1	*	> Why are you taking it so personally?     Because it's misinformation. Apparently facts don't matter. 
t1_dug5mdv	1	*	That isnt true though. Its just as common for ALL age groups. Many teenagers dont text and drive due to gruesome presentations that are put on by the schools.
t1_dugeqrb	1	*	Thanks again!  Agreed! The story has always fascinated me. 
t1_dug0flg	1	*	Or maybe its a pointless and bigoted comment that adds nothing to the conversation?

t1_dug2buw	0	*	Did you expect an actual TLDR of a 2 paragraph and 3 sentence comment?
t1_dufz343	0	*	No, but this person wanted an instant death in a head-on collision. Sounds like in their ideal situation, they die instantly in a head-on collision.
t1_dufrfyr	1	*	Yeah like I don't know how you could possibly argue against either point.  Source: whatever I want to be because we're on the internet
t1_dufy61i	1	*	Ive seen this before, so mentioning it in a comment thread is making me maaaad.

t1_dug26ir	1	*	Oh wow thats very relieving and humane. I should have clarified US military but thats implied and shouldn't require a genius to see it. Durrrr
t1_dugv4m6	0	*	I mean you have an ethical responsibility too you know.

t1_dt9mifm	0	*	> none of those countries really matter in the situation  Then Jerusalem isn't off the table, because what Trump says doesn't matter.

t1_dv4bbla	1	*	So, like Lenin?

t1_dum01by	0	*	If a private citizen isn't getting paid for missing work due to being accused of a crime, neither should the police
t1_dum0jdt	0	*	The police arent private sector. And if you are on administrative leave due to a forseeble outcome of your normal work then yes you would be paid.

t1_ds9up5g	0	*	Thats not how citizenship works.
t1_dsbk2a7	1	*	Criticism is fine. Criticizing the government is basically a daily part of life in Israel. Again, the problem is when people are weirdly obsessed with Israel to the exclusion of everything else.

t1_dsb17d5	0	*	false equivalency being against a state is not calling for the holocaust.
t1_dsa6as9	0	*	So why is it only meant to refer to the hatred of one type of semitic person?
t1_dsa5gca	0	*	eh, seems the word government is used differently in Britain and Germany, then.
t1_dsao203	1	*	Their government supports Israel for a number of reasons, but the German people's (supposedly)high opinion of Israel is nowhere near the primary one.
t1_dsa7vw8	0	*	That's kinda different, because the native population in Liberia is also black. No zionist is going to redefine the Jewish in Jewish state to also include the Palestinians.
t1_dsbj3q2	0	*	Given a country, yeah one that has been nearly wiped out twice by a league of Arab nations and ignored by the west. Now after giving Jews 1% of the ME people question that judgement

t1_dtn9koq	0	*	Saying 'the majority of people support religious laws' is not defending oppression.

t1_duof7ce	0	*	Federal licensure requirement for all purchases with a 6 week mandatory waiting period. 
t1_duoobwz	0	*	Serious question for you. What makes an AR-15 an assault rifle?  What does an AR-15 do differently from any other semi-automatic rifle? What makes an AR-15 more lethal than other rifles?
t1_duocwwz	0	*	Someone willing to shoot people isnt worried about the law around guns.    
t1_duo1r2y	1	*	I own AR's and handguns and i completely agree.  At an age where consequences still aren't understood, how can a child understand the consequences of a lethal weapon?
t1_duqmdss	1	*	Funny how Scott just endorsed raising the age of gun ownership to 21.
t1_duoumy2	1	*	Right, like I said it would require the support of the armed forces. The US citizenry has far too much of a handicap. 
t1_dupjqzq	1	*	That is entirely fuckin ridiculous. 
t1_duoe849	0	*	So millions of legitimate and safe gun owners should have to give up their guns to prevent what, 850 deaths over the past 40 years?
t1_duocbmx	0	*	So at first it is a killing machine, now the rifles are pathetic and little? Hmm.
t1_duon82h	0	*	Yes. You can buy an AR-15 at the age of 18. Handguns are 21. 
t1_dup54oc	0	*	What makes you think America is?
t1_duoajsd	1	*	Would u prefer to define automobiles your own way or use the definitions these companies that make the automobiles use?
t1_duozo7y	0	*	Is that so? Then why do countries with gun licenses and no right to carry a gun in public unless showing an imminent threat to their lives by violence so much fewer shootings?
t1_dup5g3s	1	*	The core of our government is to safe guard our liberties not our lives.  That is actually written into the Constitution.
t1_dunytqe	1	*	That makes absolutely no sense.   If that is the 'typical Government response', then why aren't we hearing the Government use it as one ?
t1_duo51qt	0	*	It has been collected. We just don't get access to NCIS.
t1_duoe6ef	0	*	I think the ability to defend your self, your family, your home and your property is a very important human principal.
t1_duo74zl	1	*	Yep, what's worse is that they were two different parties. 
t1_e2v7out	1	*	Bayonet?? That's the holder for the grenade launcher didn't you know
t1_duntatp	1	*	Im merely indicating that a hard bar on voting is an obvious restriction on your first amendment right to self expression. 
t1_duok12t	0	*	They called the news and claimed him.  Had anyone double checked, it would've been clear they were just seeking publicity.
t1_duo6w98	1	*	I was talking about the individual nations. :)
t1_duodkin	0	*	What? No. Please dont get your stupid close to any guns.
t1_dupbmaa	0	*	For example, i see you have aspergers i personally wouldn't want you owning any guns. Especially that condition mixed with alt right leanings would make me concerned. 
t1_duo1bt1	1	*	the same chicago that shares a very close border to indiana... where guns are practically given away ? Yeah, that one... 
t1_dur0bi3	1	*	No, but I was checking to see if you were...and you failed.
t1_duojwew	0	*	You don't.  What a person does inside their home, provided they aren't harming others, is their own business.  
t1_dtizw9j	1	*	It's written in the history books, it's not a belief. 
t1_dtig38e	0	*	The USA does not follow the Geneva Convention. And it's been discussed countless times that the prison isn't just used for enemy combatants. 
t1_dtif4tk	0	*	Uhhh....what? I mean about the first part.
t1_dtiih6g	0	*	All the TVs had that stupid picture motion enhancing smoothing function enabled, so everything looked like fake 60fps! It drove several prisoners insane. 
t1_dtj4vi5	1	*	https://www.uratex.com.ph/world-records-sleeping/
t1_dtix944	0	*	Well he gave a lengthy explanation with facts on why he believes that. What is your counter argument? 
t1_dtif9dr	0	*	Okay, but if the crimes werent committed in America, why are they being held by Americans in an American prison?
t1_dtioede	0	*	I can't believe you snowflakes care more about the discomfort of terrorists than the victims of their ideological violence.  You're pathetic.
t1_dtj2io6	0	*	wat
t1_dtih2rl	0	*	That'd be close to $1600 now.   That shit's actually outrageous. Is each of those handmade by someone?
t1_dtieo9a	0	*	But hes not taking a salary guys, everything is fine. 
t1_dtie3y2	0	*	You saying it took 20 years to design a fridge? 
t1_dtiqb35	1	*	Ew lol
t1_dtig9d7	0	*	But checks need to be cashed 180 days after issuance, at least every check I have ever received in the states that.  Edit: fixed some grammatical errors that made me come off as a moron.
t1_dtikfim	0	*	The audio was a half second behind the video!
t1_dtivmsx	0	*	So child killers are terrorists?  Or is it the method used to kill children that makes a  person a terrorist?
t1_dtighm2	0	*	Oh no! My a terrorist!
t1_dtirbfh	1	*	um, i'm pretty sure kennedy has them both beat.  he's missing his brain. totally unhealthy
t1_dtiuibe	1	*	Lmao thank you!! The guy u replied to got a wee bit too excited 
t1_dtimc6o	0	*	obama processed like 90% of them, which is frankly impressive considering congress was completely uncooperative and wouldn't even let them be tried in court. 
t1_dtilb1j	0	*	Yup, they didnt employ anyone, or pay any local taxes, or purchase the goods and services of any local business. We should probably kick them out of the US too in that case.
t1_dtiisvv	0	*	Over on /r/bipolar, we call ourselves the Chosen Ones  (Because when you're manic, you feel that way)
t1_dtl2tc4	1	*	The context of this comment thread is Guantanamo Bay being closed down and those individuals coming to the US.  You said they didn't have rights in this scenario when in fact they do.
t1_dtrf63g	0	*	I need to grow up because i respect human rights and think that all people deserve equal treatment?  Sure buddy. 
t1_dtiqtzk	1	*	> good mid to late life crisis as any  I'd say better mid life crisis. I hope I'm in good enough shape to do a marathon when I'm older.  \#FightTheDecrepitency
t1_dtie5b9	0	*	Each President can carry a fucking cooler if they want food while they fly.  
t1_dtj95ny	0	*	That's not how rights work. Everybody has the same rights. You do not get to violate other people's rights because it makes you feel better.  It's very depressing that I have to explain this. 
t1_dtif62a	0	*	No offense but they arent inventing refrigeration, they are designing  a commercial fridge to fit in an airplane. Why would you need 10 engineers for a year? 
t1_dtig576	0	*	I think that is the implied naval blockade discount.
t1_dtijzjb	1	*	I think this hammer could be close to that price!, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEKsPyNh4sw
t1_dtirr7n	0	*	There are also experiments where the tested took heavy toll...
t1_dtihfho	1	*	Aggressive negotiations
t1_dtigg54	0	*	ENHANCE!   What is this, CSI?
t1_dtiq304	0	*	> Prisoners of War  The US hasn't actually declared war though, so they can't really claim these people are POWs. 
t1_dtixpl2	1	*	So being intelligent means being responsible for tens of coups across the globe, civil wars, and torture ?  
t1_dtise5j	0	*	A lot huh?  I guess I'll have to take your word for it! 
t1_dtigbxv	1	*	Under the law of no-backsies, the US gets to forever maintain a naval base on their soil.
t1_dtj350a	0	*	just...just wow. You are actively calling for foreign actors to disrupt the American government because you don't like the policies. 
t1_dtjx3vi	0	*	Right, right. Of course you dont. Most conservatives have amnesia about the last 8 years and how Obama was treated by conservatives. But go ahead, carry on 
t1_dtigblc	0	*	Like Bu..bu...bu...But no! At least, I think. I look like an idiot sitting here at work vocalizing this and trying to figure it out. Luckily it's just me and some animal patients..They won't tell.
t1_dtj3ptc	1	*	What do you think a legal settlement is?  It's hush money, with legal blackmail to back it up.
t1_dtifce8	0	*	So would you prefer Trump or Obama right now? 
t1_dtigwji	0	*	Compared to all of the other presidents who put secret service and flight costs towards your college loans?
t1_dtir08h	0	*	Alot less now than a year ago... 
t1_dtifpk9	0	*	Blackwater operated well outside of those limits though.   And they were basically immune from prosecution.
t1_dtiifqr	0	*	Also known as war crimes that elicit horrifically bad intel.  Cheney is such an evil piece of shit.
t1_dtimwy2	1	*	I think we should be thankful that closing it would only cost 80 million then

t1_dtk1izc	1	*	Just making sure.
t1_dtl7340	0	*	Kind of painting with a broad brush arent we?
t1_dtihvxb	0	*	Solitary confinement, and Ensure up your nose if you decide to skip a meal. Not worth $341 a month if you ask me. 
t1_dtimvck	1	*	Dude, guys, this one actually is a wizard!
t1_dtigfag	1	*	I get your point, but I think every moment he's playing golf instead of Commander-in-Chief saves more lives in the long run.
t1_dtig2e0	0	*	Running water, electricity, beach front, lot of spare rooms for guests...Not a bad deal.
t1_dtip1es	1	*	They put a teaspoon of sand in my shoes and bedsheets *every day*.
t1_dtiheel	0	*	There's no way it's turning a profit.
t1_dtit8ow	0	*	You are engaged in propaganda via whataboutism. Congratulations on being brainwashed 
t1_dtiqs5f	1	*	Well he has polio but at least he doesn't have lepracy.
t1_dtiuo33	0	*	Good thing most of it was scandals that had no credibility in the 90's when they actually happened.
t1_dtj26k6	0	*	>with no negative effects   Gonna need a citation. This claim is pretty huge. There are side effects of even 24 hours with no sleep.
t1_dtj7hq8	1	*	What even is this
t1_dtijd8t	0	*	no, actual prisoners of war have rights. 
t1_dtiuzqg	1	*	Oh, believe me I know. I'm a decently religious person, and Brownback makes me think God isn't real.
t1_dtihzhg	0	*	Okay then man, keep blaming this on others, but you're still objectively wrong. No one should have to prove your point other than you.
t1_dtja14c	0	*	How do you determine that without a trial?
t1_dtj7olt	0	*	I already explained, with my linked article, that you obviously didn't read.

t1_dtig5br	0	*	I understand but I'm not sure how to adequately explain it.
t1_dtihxuk	0	*	The government contracted a lot of private companies to do a lot of different things back then.  Ill just leave it at that.  Now i like my coffee with 2 creams and 2 sugars please. 
t1_dtifvrp	0	*	This guy Air Force Ones
t1_dtikf5a	0	*	Ya ever seen a slug get eatin by a praying mantis, it doesn't go well.  Anyway Trump is fat, has small hands, and could use a chin tuck.
t1_dtiwd6s	0	*	they also hacked the GOP... wonder why they didnt get any leaks out...

t1_dtjzf3v	1	*	Thanks for the links.

t1_dtie244	0	*	MacDonald's don't do airline delivery?
t1_dtighf2	0	*	I know you're being sarcastic, but writing your a terrorist instead of you're a terrorist does give the comment an air of sincerity.

t1_dtj6tup	1	*	I get that it's different. I get that it's the same. I get what you are saying. I get what I'm saying. I'm not arguing in any way, merely showing similarities.

t1_dtisv6o	0	*	Ive personally known 2 people that have died after being awake for more than 48 hours. But Im sure there were other health complications involved.
t1_dtig82t	0	*	You've never heard someone do that?  it's like, [ah ah ah](https://youtu.be/RfiQYRn7fBg?t=17) but more of an exclamation instead of just a correction.
t1_dtiwt0o	0	*	You can live in a world of maybes if you want, I prefer actual practical solutions
t1_dtihw86	1	*	As opposed to just plugging in a couple of normal fridges? Or managing on MREs after the world has literally just ended?

t1_dth8y89	0	*	Ah yes, the democratic process of shelling your parlament with tanks: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1993_Russian_constitutional_crisis
t1_dthai73	0	*	I think a big thing many miss is that Yeltsin was very much a capitalist, but he wasn't much of a democrat. This is core to many of the problems that would lead to Putin's rise. 
t1_dssxmsq	0	*	Killing someone in self defense or in a war zone is very, very different then killing an unarmed and helpless person. 
t1_dv3y692	0	*	whoooshhh  I think you are more upset then he would be, calm down buddy it really isn't that serious.
t1_dv4aj5o	0	*	Indians are technically Caucasian too, would you call them white? Isn't brown mostly a term for non-white Caucasians?

t1_ds2lhpi	0	*	It's weep's John, we've been o'er this a million times already. -- Paul probably.
t1_ds3ud5t	1	*	Probably because people can still function with weed so addiction blurs with 'habit
t1_ds36y5g	0	*	Yes. Been doing it for years.
t1_ds2k89m	1	*	I mean it grows outside and gets rained on 
t1_ds28cgq	0	*	Yes it does.  Unfortunately it causes rebound anxiety and insomnia, when I stop I can't sleep for about 3-4 nights.  But it's extremely mild physical withdrawal compared to any other substance.
t1_ds2cu1j	1	*	And thats not what most people get as a primary symptom anyway 
t1_ds2l9sq	1	*	It isn't as physically addicting as alcohol or opiates, that's where the confusion lies. You won't trip out having a bad withdrawal, but you might get irritable, like if you need a cigarette.
t1_ds26yd1	0	*	Talk to any addiction councillor, the physical addiction is the easiest part to deal with
t1_ds2576h	0	*	But I don't want a hangover. 
t1_ds3ndc3	1	*	In relation to the mental aspect it's quite quick. Which was the point I was trying to get across. Detox is 1-2 weeks for most I believe.

t1_ds2ep33	0	*	Nowhere remotely fun I bet haha
t1_ds2cu45	1	*	I don't know enough about the actual withdrawal symptoms of opioid addiction so I just went with the common symptom I know. I know it's absolutely terrible though.
t1_ds2617c	0	*	I'm so glad you don't know linkedin. It's awful and pointless. It's social media for business which no one needs
t1_dtzfqus	1	*	It's really not that complicated. Hurt feelings, people kill when they are pissed, laws to keep people from killing ect. 
t1_dtz6lyu	1	*	Another one for the pile I guess.
t1_dtzsyou	1	*	No; Paedophilia is sexual attraction towards children.  Child molestation and abuse (from people who choose to act on their Paedophilia) severely damages children.  
t1_ds4am6q	0	*	I didn't say we weren't, but the consequence of that hasn't *overall* (keyword) been terrible. We see much less death from war than in the vast majority of human history.
t1_ds2cf5x	1	*	lol what
t1_ds1szsj	1	*	Exactly, Trump's calls to lock up his political opponent are a threat to the republic.

t1_ds8q97w	1	*	Think I'm sensing some constraints, but then again there's that username.
t1_ds8t7jr	1	*	More specifically, things consciously made through human agency. We make lots of stuff that can fairly be called natural: blood cells, saliva, dandruff, babies, etc.
t1_dsc8fde	1	*	Ha ha, good choice! I'm re-watching Brotherhood now. Very favorite characters are Alex Louise Armstrong & Hughes, but Alphonse is definitely up there.
t1_ds8uq79	0	*	Maybe you're thinking of the Scottish Fold? 
t1_ds8fkzp	0	*	Again, pugs are not a species. They are a subset of dogs. They can breed with other dogs, which would help the problem pugs are having now.

t1_ds8x2sq	0	*	Because it just depends on the lineage itself not on the breed.   I'll repeat it once more, it's not only about the breed, there is a huge amount of variety even within breeds.

t1_ds8efxo	1	*	I just want to point out that while your argument has flaws, the comparison between species is not one of them.
t1_ds8i3u7	1	*	I was. You don't think 'sorry you're too emotional to have this discussion but *hopefully* someday you come to your senses' as condescending too? 
t1_ds8u629	0	*	I can see the issue but I love that movie too much to not bring up in this conversation. 
t1_ds8dz2y	1	*	How do you not grasp that there is a good reason behind those hashtags? You know, raising awareness that these breeds are needlessly suffering? Who gives a fuck if some people use twitter to do it?
t1_ds8i6be	0	*	Did you read the rest of my comment? 
t1_ds8i1vz	0	*	Yep. Technically skyscrapers are natural - but if you use the word like that, it's useless. 
t1_ds8t6q1	0	*	That's what I don't get though. My dog is a pug so she is suffering. Isn't that inhumane? Shouldn't I put her down because that's better than suffering? 
t1_ds8ge7q	1	*	Cheers! Do the same to your good boy/girl. 
t1_dsbneng	1	*	I can understand that-- I don't have the heart to do it myself, but definitely do realize it's the better option. Good work.  Thanks for the photo! I love that white one's pose!
t1_dsdcs2c	0	*	Got ya! I'm on board with that, i definitely think that's a good way to look at things 
t1_ds8mzhc	0	*	Because people like pugs and want pugs? If you're not reducing puppy mill puppy quantities, what's *your* point? The options here are salvage a breed or end a breed.
t1_ds9xlfg	1	*	Thanks! He is pretty cute :) Just lazy af. 
t1_ds8q7hw	0	*	Well considering cats are prolific murderers in the wild, slightly less mobile cats might be a perfect solution to the wholesale destruction feral cats can wreak on a local population. 
t1_ds8qorz	0	*	So Boston terriers go extinct then? Good luck with that
t1_ds90mfp	0	*	There is.
t1_ds8k8t2	0	*	You do you. Dogs arent the only animals we suffer for our own pleasures. 
t1_dsdewda	1	*	Yea. I lived there tho. So most of them are me seeing it. But if your white. They will just ransom. Usually not kill. 
t1_dtxirxs	0	*	That's half of north America. If you're willing to go as far as call half of NA shitty creature, you either have too much hate in you, or your botched procedure really fucked up your psyche. 
t1_dtuetss	0	*	 God, it was a joke.
t1_dtujlbp	1	*	N oworries, I appreciate the thoguht you put into this.
t1_dtf7x6u	0	*	I love how you just ignored my entire point about capitalism not meaning free market.
t1_dus3h5t	0	*	Does religion cause problems in society currently? is the average life expectancy of a human still 30?
t1_duvkpx0	1	*	Says a redditor who publicly calls me a liar based on the most cockeyed bullshit imaginable. 
t1_ducovzx	0	*	Mate the only babies I put out are the huge turds I drop into the bog.
t1_dtmmmqq	0	*	Lots of false assumptions here, not enough time for me to go through all of them, so things end here. Have a good day sir!
t1_dusshxl	0	*	I didnt lose the arguments Im just done talking to you. 
t1_dszzgxk	0	*	The GOP doesn't deal with anything other than wanton banner waving.
t1_dszkzpz	0	*	Trump supports DACA, so according to your logic, he doesn't care about the law. 
t1_dszl654	0	*	Lol yes you all live under a facist dictator who acts just like Hitler  How will you survive
t1_dt0fr3r	1	*	Yeah, except it's looking like the GOP took a shitload of money from Russia through the NRA as well.
t1_dt068ka	0	*	Dont aborted foetuses get a free ride to heaven? I fail to understand the logic. Thats a saved soul?
t1_dt01wpm	0	*	[Yeah, that must be it](https://i.redditmedia.com/s-69UTs4yvJDuj4nPX3FX9Sv-yfe7VgCXuLQhweuvJg.jpg?w=500&s=2bdeaa0215bbb17b23b21124572e1b0d)
t1_dt0a960	1	*	Jar Jar with a tard helmet.
t1_dszkb2f	0	*	Can I just ask out of all those things, why are you glad to out of the Paris agreement? 
t1_dt0o2yv	0	*	Yeah, it's the liberals trying to do all those things. You're not even trying to argue in good faith so fuck off
t1_dt809dl	1	*	Trump is like the anti-robinhood, taking money from the poor and giving it to the rich. What a great guy!
t1_dszjrva	1	*	You ever got a warning instead of a ticket?
t1_dt0165u	0	*	And you're actively hurting our country try by defending these traitors? Typical Republican scumbag
t1_dt07xzn	1	*	>compared to *fucking Russia*, America is the Empire 
t1_dt02wl1	0	*	Thanks, i just almost spilled my coffee over the table.
t1_dt03932	1	*	Dogs gotta eat too
t1_dt025zw	1	*	Okay
t1_dt0b300	1	*	This all just makes me wonder. Do you think the Empire was doing humanitarian work off camera? I wonder what all kinds of good it did around the universe that we just don't get to see. 
t1_dt0rplc	1	*	Yeah but the question was why is Trump still president.  Republicans are trying to pass the legislation their donors want is why.
t1_dt0nb0y	0	*	Yet they can rely on your vote and your defense of their agenda. 
t1_dt04qoz	0	*	Ugh, fuck it I'll just have whatever you're smoking. There's no getting through to you people so I might as well just be dumb and numb as well. 
t1_dt0p126	0	*	you're delusional.
t1_dtjm89g	1	*	Yikes dude. You're trying to pick a fight where there isn't one. 
t1_dtj5jng	1	*	I agree
t1_dtjgd4w	0	*	You must be fun at parties. 
t1_dtiwhok	1	*	That makes more sense. That's the problem with many low skill jobs. People only put forth minimum effort and then wonder why they're stuck making minimum wage. 
t1_dtj4ckq	0	*	You've never been homeless lol. Stop talking out of your ass. Faking a prayer like hundreds of thousands of kids do every Sunday is miles better than lying in street garbage in 15 degree weather. 
t1_dtj3fto	0	*	Please point to even a single homeless shelter run by Scientologists.
t1_dtj2x7m	1	*	I run through the park near my house a couple times a week. Condescension will not get us anywhere. 
t1_dtj8phr	0	*	Do you think this is a good solution?
t1_dtiwguu	0	*	You don't live in LA or SF apparently. 
t1_dtj1q2l	0	*	i agree with all except the women over men one... im a guy too but i feel like the streets are just way more dangerous for a woman 
t1_dtj6vel	0	*	But you just said any money taken from you forcibly is evil. How is this okay now?
t1_dtje1ju	0	*	Yes.  Do you vote?
t1_dtizkez	0	*	Fortunately they're in the UK so their treatment would be free.  Mental health care isn't as good as it should be but getting meds isn't a problem.
t1_dtj7son	0	*	Username does not check out. So if we ask do we just get an answer? Is the dont ask party only suppose to help you out? Do you or a loved one have mesothelioma? 
t1_dtiyvsv	1	*	I specifically said 'one of the reasons' and you took that as 'the only reason'.  You're trying to argue against something that was never said.
t1_dtjndxg	0	*	I mean, thats entirely nonsensical. I still think people can have their minds changed, whether of not there is free will.
t1_dtji61a	1	*	Is that what you're doing? If not what makes your obligation different. 
t1_dtjcr4s	1	*	You can do both, the people trying to sleep on their property isn't sleeping in a shelter for a reason.
t1_dtjjcm5	1	*	As a British person - damn right. Empty asset homes ruin the community and it's completely outrageous in London especially at the moment. 
t1_dtj6zq4	0	*	Alternatively, maybe you didn't want to do y, but wanted to do x even less.
t1_dtjcuvr	0	*	Addiction and mental illness dont make people rapists. Thats a bullshit argument.  If they have no history of violence theres no real reason to segregate.
t1_dtk1guz	0	*	As far as I can tell that is fine so long as you also love them.
t1_dtj3coe	1	*	Id open that up to most religions to be honest.
t1_dtjlfw7	0	*	get a list of the school shooters since columbine and see who's been under psych care or on SSRIs. it's nearly all of them
t1_dtjb6mx	1	*	Let's face it, EVERY country has homeless people to deal with, and I'm willing to bet it's just as partisan in other countries as it is in America.  Only the names of the parties change.
t1_dtiwryh	1	*	I don't think a lot of people have done exactly that, no.
t1_dtj40wj	0	*	You guys don't know it yet, but you're writing the script for Transformers 7 right now.
t1_dtlcjwj	1	*	Okay, thanks for informing me. Of course Germany or Japan would have more nuance than what my mom says, it's just my mom *really* wants to defend what the US does.
t1_dtj0y21	0	*	How do you decide what anecdotes don't matter? By how closely they match your opinions?
t1_dtj1j1a	1	*	Nah that would've ruined it.  
t1_dtixpx0	0	*	7th biggest city in the nation and our benches are just fine without these bullshit bars. 
t1_dtjkk9a	1	*	Helping at shelters and protecting your property are not mutually exclusive.
t1_dtivbob	0	*	I understand that man, but this isn't a good solution.    This isn't even a solution.
t1_dtiwzlx	1	*	Free bath and tumble dryer is nice
t1_dtiwmui	0	*	Where I live, if you leave your car unlocked at night it might be your car. 
t1_dtjioib	1	*	Where is this major city? In california there is legit human poop on the ground 
t1_dtix2cy	0	*	Maybe don't call it a cell ;P but honestly this sounds a bit like section 8 housing.
t1_dtj7mtx	0	*	Would you agree that the ground, especially concrete and asphalt, tends to absorb more heat than a raised bench?
t1_dtjgt1w	1	*	NICE!  What do you call a boomerang that doesn't come back?   *A stick* 
t1_dtjjoxp	1	*	it's like a dimension vortex opens up.... [something like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jk3xBhqcjqY) 
t1_dtj2mcj	1	*	The park two blocks from me would disagree but it's possible that Seattle does something different than here. 
t1_dtived7	0	*	Disagree, and it doesn't even actually matter for the discussion now that I think about it. I'm just saying, this bench stuff is stupid. It's not a solution to anything.
t1_dtjoy4f	0	*	Dude, I cannot wrap my head around the idea of being OK with working next to a mugger, murderer, or rapist.  Posts like these solidify for me that the cliche liberalism is a mental disorder is true
t1_dtj14ms	0	*	There are tons of areas like this but it's not really popular to stick up for men these days. 
t1_dtjata4	0	*	You've never seen drunk idiots pee where they shouldn't?  Yeah I'm calling bullshit on that. 
t1_dtjhnnu	0	*	I just crowed back exactly what you told me, dude lol. 
t1_dtn53tx	0	*	Do those women think that we should make life more difficult for the homeless?
t1_dtiw9as	1	*	Weird the ones near my home don't seem to mind it. 
t1_dtj6uxy	0	*	I mean, CCF was low-key and truly charitable. Scientology is a straight-up scam.
t1_dtj2x0f	1	*	Sall reletive
t1_dtiws2h	0	*	It is. It forces the bum to move on and hopefully take a shit somewhere else. It also may motivate him to reconsider his life choices. 
t1_dtjyzlx	1	*	This is true.  What do you believe should be done about the homeless issue?
t1_dtj465u	1	*	So youre saying that we should physically stop people from being able to speed?  Thats not how the law works either, buddy.
t1_dtj5eul	1	*	Cheers :)
t1_dtjcpsy	0	*	So invite them to live with you.
t1_dtjei22	0	*	Got it, you are a world class hypocrite.
t1_dtkhp60	1	*	But thats before Monty Python. Isnt that Marty Feldmon with the bug eyes?
t1_dtjcy3f	0	*	no, you're misunderstanding  i'm saying that you can't assume it to be true as you did in the original post  what's the confusion?
t1_dtj3a74	0	*	Because that's a stupid question is why, what are you thinking man? Like what line of thought led you to believe that was worth posting?
t1_dtkinbk	1	*	I don't mind seeing unkempt people at all - is there anything else you'd like to randomly throw out there?
t1_dtjgiet	0	*	What evidence do you have that putting up more shelters will reduce the harassment I'm concerned with. 
t1_du84ns3	1	*	Think it means he is Flemish, so from the Dutch speaking part of Belgium.
t1_du826ik	1	*	Usually referred to as Flemish in English, but English is weird.
t1_du7ohjl	0	*	Yes. Thank you!   I didn't know they were different words and thought it was a synonym.
t1_dthmz1u	0	*	Good, then we agree they can wear whatever they want and there's nothing sexist about women that do or do not want to wear certain clothing.
t1_dthe7jb	1	*	at one point
t1_dth7orj	0	*	Iran has been a guiding light when it comes to civil rights  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcPFvHrMX-U
t1_dsskajm	1	*	Theres a general scare, its not bitcoin, if news came out that affected how bitcoin works, it wouldnt affect eth. The news about China regulating applies to everything.
t1_dsrr2on	0	*	I'm not mad. YOU think I'm mad. If offering facts as to why you can't get hold of a card is being mad, then I'm very mad.
t1_dssb9ui	1	*	Cartman was right.
t1_dstcp0c	0	*	Yes you did miss something. Theres a lot of drama between bch and btc. The people behind bch want bitcoin to drop and bch to take over.
t1_dstrgog	0	*	Wow... you sure are butthurt about this...
t1_dst4cmy	1	*	Wish they'd do that in North America.
t1_dssddcp	1	*	Cheaper than doing it with guns.
t1_dta17ml	0	*	So you want the entirety of Jerusalem more than you don't want more war, is that right? 
t1_dtahf0u	0	*	Do you think those people are dissidents or something? A man scared of running out of protection money and hemorrhaging more every day in Yemen would shake down his cousins without pause. 
t1_dtny1m6	1	*	I presume that is the conclusion because I see nothing but political reasons for releasing this publicly in the first place. Surely there are internal ways they can deal with improper legal protocol.
t1_dtoebwv	1	*	I believe they're referring to the gospel of Hannity.
t1_dtnyfc0	1	*	lol. I have high hopes as well. Hopefully we've all learned our lesson from 2016.
t1_dtpa0eu	0	*	Go ahead and quote where I said that dummy. You are the one who is wrong here. 
t1_dtocbf6	1	*	Oh I'm serious. [Here is the vote to impeach Trump](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/06/trump-impeachment-vote-fail-282888), which failed miserably. Show me the vote to impeach Obama, I'll wait.
t1_dto4d86	0	*	Hahaha truly adorable that you believe that. 
t1_dto01nq	0	*	>Nunes did not attempt to discredit the Muller investigation  So then what was this whole memo thing about then?
t1_dto4vlo	0	*	>  The warrant was obtained thru proper process.  Yes it was but they lied to the court whilst going through the process.
t1_dto2w5y	0	*	Then what what is the point of the memo and why does Nunes leave out context and information out of the memo in a way to make the Mueller investigation look bad?
t1_dtnxaob	0	*	And you have a serious case of making up words that don't mean anything. 
t1_dtuz6hq	0	*	You've claimed multiple times that it is directly connected. Go outside. 
t1_dto2w83	0	*	Which is being conducted by the DOJ and FBI.
t1_dtow59p	0	*	I love how your first instinct wasn't to dispute that you would.
t1_dto3yun	0	*	Awww, the magatard is calling for civility? Too cute! Seriously though, you people have the intelligence of pond scum and I'll never get tired of letting you know. 
t1_dtny5p9	0	*	How is there a clear FISA abuse? We haven't seen the full document, all we have is a 4 page partisan highlight reel.  We don't know what other evidence was used.
t1_dtpnwnj	0	*	You completely missed the point. It's like I'm playing chess with a pigeon. 
t1_dt6uat9	1	*	Fujimori was recently pardoned by PPK, who needed his son's support to avoid impeachment.   Edit: PPK's impeachment process was part of the same series of scandals that got Lula convicted today btw
t1_du75yjn	1	*	Sometimes people here confuse the two. I've seen every people have the government they deserve more then a few times.  The comment that started this chain is an example, very common in Israel threads.
t1_du6mkwk	0	*	He was radically left and a socialist. He was against capitalism. 
t1_du6mfua	0	*	>  complete with terror tunnels to kill Israeli citizens.   No bias at all to see here folks, move along.
t1_du7wzob	0	*	and there's your idiocy and racism in full view for everyone. i bet you marched in charlottesville w a torch and your kkk buddies.
t1_du6wkyn	1	*	Then that's a problem, because the entire debate is about non-lethal weapons.
t1_du74w4v	0	*	There are 6 million Jews in the US. Total. Less than 2% of the population. Unless you rep NY or CA you can safely ignore Jewish voters with 0 repercussions. 
t1_du73h4i	0	*	That everybody on Reddit talks about Vonnegut. He's not some hidden gem.

t1_du6rina	0	*	Ah-huh. Sure thing. Mind pointing me to specific articles you think support your claim
t1_du8fssh	0	*	It's insulting to suggest you were being intentionally obtuse?  Maybe next time don't be a dick and communication will be easier.  I'll let the cumulative votes make my point for me, jackass.
t1_du73g21	0	*	Israels neighbor tried to destroy it multiple times? Are you talking about Palestine? 
t1_du6o99v	1	*	Agreed, though there is an awful lot of overlap.
t1_du6idt2	1	*	Sarcasm? And do what again? Educate people on topics they have no clue about?
t1_du6kdh1	1	*	Do you feel that way about a lot of critically acclaimed modern classics?
t1_du77bra	1	*	Nope. Arabs are an ethnic group. Blackness is not. Israel was created 70 years ago. Israeli Bedouins have living relatives in the West Bank, Jordan, and Egypt...  Try again.
t1_du6ohtu	1	*	British federal employees in Boston were tarred, feathered and hung in the streets 
t1_du6vsy2	0	*	Similar to how they tell Palestinians pick any of the Arab countries around you and go There, you are arab too arnt you?  So the majority of Israelis can pick any eropean country and go there too
t1_du6ojo4	0	*	LateStageCapitalism is a pretty well known sub. If you are politically left and frequent political subs regularly you'll see it come up eventually.

t1_du6yjrd	1	*	So were allies with them because our government is comprised of religious nuts with no morals and no ability to broker peace through diplomacy, just big guns. Heard. Fuck. 
t1_du6t5ik	0	*	Sure Israeli, whatever you say. 
t1_du6l4lt	0	*	Sounds like what you want to do in Palestine with settlements inserted to break up the P territory
t1_du6ni7x	0	*	He was though, you're talking about a socialist.
t1_du6i4os	1	*	not that far off, considering how emotional some (not even personally involved) people get about that matter of all the others. 
t1_du6z81r	0	*	You don't understand the system. It's not 30% out of the entire country, it's 30% out of the people who voted.
t1_du6loyn	0	*	Sounds a lot like Palestine
t1_du6j88c	0	*	It's weird, but well worth reading nonetheless.
t1_du6x90u	0	*	It sounds amazing 
t1_du6nca9	1	*	If it was directed at me then you should probably know that I am not Jewish.  But good for you to admit you're racist. Most people are too afraid. Just dont expect any applause, okay? 
t1_du714fw	1	*	> Umm. How about the article we are commenting on right now?  You mean the one from Al Jazeera? I think we all know Al Jazeera might have a slight bias.
t1_du7kp7t	1	*	http://redditlist.com/
t1_du6q1n8	1	*	I was banned from there and I agree with 95% of what goes on there.   My main gripe was with voting which immediately made me a despot dictator loving fascist...
t1_du765uh	0	*	Who doesn't love Eugene Debs come on
t1_du73nsg	0	*	I utilized irony sarcastically to elicit a chuckle.  Are you, like, a new robot or recently arrived alien trying to understand human interactions?  
t1_du6te55	1	*	American capitalism is the only capitalism that exists in America.
t1_du7j1ac	1	*	Well, it looks like our perceptions of the reality in Occupied Territories/Israel are so far apart that we really have no way of discussing this productively.
t1_du6lmj1	1	*	So it goes.
t1_du6vx77	1	*	lol are you for real? Yeah, rich white powerful Hollywood folks are toootally held accountable for sexual misconduct by Hollywood PD, am I right?
t1_du70mgz	0	*	God liberals absolutely refuse to see any criticism of capitalism as criticism of capitalism, don't they

t1_du6kpqr	0	*	Or 4 option - a person who despite being replied to by 50 different SJWs, still didnt get 1 goddamn source. All this could be prevented by giving 1 link.
t1_du771uz	1	*	The headline specifically say boycott the FILM FESTIVAL - not the Film.  Which is exactly what they are doing, they are refusing to attend the opening ceremony of the festival (i.e boycotting it.)
t1_du6tasj	1	*	That's two ways of saying the same thing.
t1_du6syyf	1	*	pedobacker! we got a pedobacker here!   so the police are the holy arbiters of truth, huh? they would NEVER let a rich white man get away with a crime, would they?  ...fuck outta here smh
t1_dstg4mm	0	*	I see your insult and debate skills were honed through the tough, no holds barred world of 3rd grade recess.   I'll try to retort in a way you can understand.  I KNOW YOU ARE, BUT WHAT AM I??!? 
t1_ds1ivyb	1	*	I fixed it, thanks.    But that's still my point though.   Once you start criminalizing jokes, *no one* is safe.  
t1_ds22lnb	0	*	Wolfenstein wasn't censored by any laws.  Bethesda actually censored it of their own will.

t1_duedjjq	0	*	You 2 should go on a date. 
t1_dugrbx8	0	*	Except the individual taxes are temporary.  Look at the 20 or 40 year horizon.  I guess since you are wrong about the basic time limits of the tax cuts I am done discussing with you.
t1_duea9we	0	*	Which previous comment or the IMF claim disprove what he said?
t1_dueevwe	0	*	Right, but you can't just throw everything at the wall and see what sticks. Was it derivatives trading? Or was it loose monetary policy?
t1_dugk2zt	0	*	Uhm, there might be some zeros missing?
t1_duevw2k	0	*	That's not what debt ceiling means, I think the poster meant an additional 10 times, not times 10. 
t1_duejjte	0	*	Yeah the economy would have died without his government outspending dubya 2:1 :\^) 
t1_due5lfy	0	*	That drop in the bucket is approximately 50.1 billion dollars.  Im sure you could even think of something good we could do in the states for our own people with that type of money.  
t1_due5v0v	1	*	I didnt claim it would help interest payments I said it would help the needy in our country not another country who says they hate us.

t1_ds1gj6j	0	*	 Oh my god
t1_ds1froj	0	*	No the US supported ISIS. When Trump came in he cut that shit out. Also RUssia assisted the Syrians helping them to get rid of that parasite.
t1_ds1g1ur	1	*	Talk is talk. Most Repubs talk about using/developing tactical nukes at some point. Makes their constituents moist in their dry parts. No one has used nukes in 70 years. 
t1_ds1hs9l	0	*	Without the theatre, the concert never would have occurred.
t1_ds1okjm	0	*	That was after the US got there the first time. Those skullcrushers were US-backed anti-soviet militants who seized power because the country was left to fend for itself after a devastating war.

t1_ds1k3ba	1	*	One party likes lower military spending and more infrastructure, education, and healthcare spending. The other wants to cut the safety net and raise military spending by tens of billions. 
t1_ds1f901	0	*	Using nukes might be a little () different
t1_ds1eo2o	0	*	There would be no ISIS without our idiotic invasion of Iraq. 
t1_ds1gfpm	0	*	I strongly disagree. The US is not that altruistic. Why would they want to help that country? What's the benefit to them? 
t1_ds1h9vt	0	*	His original position was to pull out of Afghanistan but he changed his mind because he decided that's how Obama created ISIS, by pulling out of Iraq too quickly.

t1_ds1it1m	0	*	Oh.. Right I forgot ISIS and the Taliban are gone now that we've become involved.  /s
t1_ds1ramb	1	*	They are still around, they just rebranded under the Russian Federation.
t1_ds1lpkc	1	*	This is such an important part to this story. Probably the most important part, and everyone seems to forgot it. 
t1_ds1lz1n	0	*	Do you understand how many nukes would be required for that to occur? It doesnt happen with 4 nukes.
t1_ds1gyc9	0	*	So,  Obama is to blame if it goes wrong,  but if he's right he was just a figurehead? 
t1_ds1fs6w	0	*	Yet he did

t1_ds1ft4l	1	*	so what?
t1_ds1q2qk	0	*	I'm a man of positions not people. I agree he tweets what he wants, I was speaking of the actual actions he takes. 
t1_ds1jnpa	1	*	its ok when we do it though, how can you hate on our freedom and democracy bringing weapons
t1_ds1fr7k	0	*	I don't think it's necessary for foreign policy,because the second he lays it out then every other nation can see that and plan accordingly. 
t1_ds1lyvg	0	*	If they tried our soldiers, Im pretty sure that wouldve lead to a full on new war. 
t1_ds1y30y	1	*	That's fine except for the fact that upsetting that very unstable region can fuck it a lot more. Like I said, they can just get their aid from Russia.
t1_ds1iqtr	0	*	I prefer smooth talking lies to the brash truth.
t1_ds374d4	1	*	Are you Bryce Dallas Howard?
t1_ds1olk1	1	*	No they just analyze seized heroin across the country and have found an extremely small amount comes from Afghanistan. I didn't say they track anything the CIA does. 
t1_ds2alkw	1	*	Haha, good memes, some people on the_donald can be quite irrational. I get downvoted quite a bit but hey, it's a place to generally speak my mind without getting banned immediately. Happy New Year

t1_ds1oexe	0	*	Ceaser was never close to Afghanistan. Doesn't matter though, he would've killed millions to keep it. Guy was genocidal.
t1_ds1ip0y	1	*	Pakistan has fought proxy wars using terrorists. That's not a real war. They lost pretty much every time their army showed up.

t1_ds1jcol	0	*	George Bush failed to follow up on Clinton's plan to kill Osama after his first inauguration and he pulled troops back from getting him in Toro Bora. 
t1_ds1hpzc	0	*	Do you think China and Russia would actually object to a retaliatory strike against a country that fired nukes over a small strip of land?
t1_ds1dwrm	0	*	Ah so u admit they were political group that used violence. That is the definition of a terrorist.
t1_ds1gke2	0	*	It would probably be good for our planet and our species if a few million of us died instantly. Not by nukes though.
t1_ds1g024	1	*	Whoosh
t1_ds1fw8j	1	*	Yeah, it's the doubling-down in the face of all evidence that's scary.  The mid-term results will be fascinating, in an Interesting Times kind of way.
t1_ds1fj3w	0	*	It's pretty rare for anyone with a concept of 'enough money' to dedicate their lives to amassing wealth.  The sort of person that might stop is unlikely to ever start.
t1_ds1in55	0	*	 Why did they do that?
t1_ds1m3vp	0	*	They have nuclear bombs and our allies and military bases in close proximity. Let's see...Hmmmmmmm....
t1_ds1u1g1	0	*	Afghanistan has *never* known peace. In the best of times, it was a bunch of isolated hill people villages run by individual warlords committing routine atrocities against one another or themselves.
t1_ds1l3tg	1	*	Oh, I never knew that. Thank you for enlightening me!
t1_ds1g40u	1	*	We also think you're idiots.
t1_ds1gm68	1	*	It's erroneous. DoD total includes US reserves, PLA total leaves out 2.3 million reservists.
t1_ds1hk2u	0	*	Invade an ally country with our military? Think bigger.
t1_ds1eodl	0	*	Actually no one wins
t1_ds1y9qb	1	*	Honestly, it really is clear. Remove the threat. Period. Because if you don't, they'll stop at nothing to hurt you. 
t1_ds1fp98	0	*	I know you cant see this, but Trump has one of the worst legacies of any living human, and thats not changing
t1_ds1ibpc	0	*	Lol, how tf is Trump in charge of that?  Edit: also the military always spends the whole budget otherwise they don't get as much the next year.
t1_ds1mubs	0	*	You're right, because going from 3.7 billion to 3.1 billion is such a loss.
t1_ds26ggv	1	*	Shit dude lol

t1_ds1oeuo	0	*	Well I don't know who has the power to cut off foreign aid, congress or the president. 
t1_ds2dyvx	1	*	Yeah, I worked for the Little House of School in Jeddah, who (which you won't find online) is headed by a 3rd degree Saudi prince. I taught 3 young Saudi princes in my class. So yes, I was in on it.
t1_ds24hzi	0	*	Oh gosh another trillion?  Drop in the bucket compared to what your boy did. 
t1_ds1f8b9	0	*	China also bribes the local militias to not attack their shit.  America won't let its people do that.  So it's a different situation for the two countries.  One can make it stable, the other cannot.
t1_ds1ru2i	0	*	He's consolidating power and promising to bring in a moderate Islam and take Saudi Arabia back to it's prosperous pre-radical times. Not seeing a problem, tbh. 
t1_ds1kmdd	0	*	And they still bitched that we violated their airspace.
t1_ds1ncmq	0	*	Did it ever really stop, though? They can ban whatever they want, but did all the growing and trade stop?
t1_ds1sd1z	0	*	Im not saying he doesnt lie, or stretch the truth.
t1_ds1rhta	0	*	A couple billion, which is a pittance in the grand scheme of things.

t1_ds1idge	0	*	you know what George Washington would have done? *eye roll*
t1_ds1il57	0	*	You don't need to be that professional.    War of attrition needs tough terrain and more people who's death costs less. Iraq was atleast a flat barren piece of land.
t1_ds1t6rt	1	*	He's not doing the majority of them. 
t1_ds28glh	1	*	Edgy
t1_ds1mqaj	1	*	US obviously played religion as something uniting for the Mujahideen to fight for, one decade later it backfired with attacks on US insitutions in Africa and 9/11.
t1_ds1h0v1	0	*	The personal attacks just keep coming!
t1_ds1meo7	0	*	Thats how you figured out the nuclear capabilities of a country?  It isnt always public information
t1_ds1ixif	0	*	With that argument, presidents cant really take credit for anything. They dont do any of the work, right?
t1_ds1jn92	0	*	Which ones is that? 
t1_ds1esgl	0	*	He doesn't mean we will use the nuke silly, he means they will. Pakistan is a nuclear power

t1_ds1hvsq	1	*	Whoosh
t1_ds1fyrc	1	*	More or less.
t1_ds1jvxx	1	*	Dispatching OBL was a huge chess piece though. It needed to be really public. Anyway wasn't the Pakistan takedown a re-creation?
t1_ds1wu4j	1	*	Yeah that irony certainly wasnt lost on me.

t1_ds25tq2	0	*	oooooh, what frightful prospect!  The Loss would be unbearable and the US will go belly up dead. 
t1_ds1eyds	1	*	ISIS wouldn't be so hard to contain if we didn't attempt to leave Iraq _while_ simultaneously attempt to fuck shit up in Syria, though.
t1_ds21pqx	0	*	That was in the news. We know it because it was in the news.
t1_ds1js04	0	*	Lol. Did a 5 year old make this map. Its made on a blog, no wonder for such a stupid shit map. No wonder. 
t1_ds1p7ig	1	*	Aye Aye Captain Hindsight
t1_ds1hghe	0	*	You're right. China and Ireland have the same International influence in the world.
t1_ds1iaux	1	*	It's just a conspiracy theory. It's been around for awhile.
t1_ds1jn9l	0	*	[this one](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0884666/)
t1_ds20yel	1	*	Hint; the USA doesnt want stability in the middle-east.  We pay lip service to wanting it, but our actions continually destabilize the region.
t1_ds1h4vt	1	*	also, it only makes MORE people become terrorist when they do that , so uh, yeah it doesnt really  end terrorism or even slow it down it only  makes it grow 
t1_ds1gb5s	0	*	It's actually been working pretty well, al-Qaeda was basically annihilated until ISIS showed up (thanks a lot, Bush...).
t1_ds1is3s	1	*	And his WMDs.
t1_ds1fewq	0	*	Outside of this possible move, it's a pretty bad legacy he's set so far.
t1_ds1gktq	0	*	It's almost like we wanted to sell more weapons and rebuild the places we destroyed to make endless money.

t1_ds1mbpc	0	*	Still not my move
t1_ds1espo	1	*	As long as the new people in power play along, thats all we can really ask for isnt it?
t1_ds1wx92	0	*	Source? That's the first I've heard about this.
t1_ds1f8t2	1	*	It's a good chunk of the way back already, just remotely from Pakistan
t1_ds1pfu8	0	*	Not necessarily and that's not implied in the list above
t1_ds1or4m	1	*	Maybe I should tweet it so you take it more seriously? Idk what to tell you dude, I guess there is no way the facts are going to break through your feel shield.
t1_ds29dsm	1	*	Hi, ok, didn't mean to infringe on any regs or rules, certainly no malice intended. To help me in future could you explain what  using a link shortener  means ?
t1_ds1mrsy	0	*	Yes
t1_ds1f0rq	1	*	Yeah, Trebuchet or nothing.       But seriously no matter where they detonate a nuke it's going to be a bad fucking time for everybody.
t1_ds1eolq	0	*	Coupled with a high probability of at least a few if not several of Pakistans nukes disappearing. 
t1_ds1t6qc	0	*	Yes, I asked you why Obama is relevant to what Trump does but all you've said so far is that Trump is less stable.
t1_ds1og0v	0	*	For the government? No, it isn't. For the manufacturers? Yes, of course. There is a big difference there.
t1_ds1fqkq	1	*	The organization funded by the US, who let's be honest was taken out by the Syrians + Russians.
t1_ds1vp6a	1	*	My personal face was when he sold guns to the cartels to try to track where they went and then ended up basically losing all of them.  Man that was a lot of fun.
t1_ds1snoy	1	*	Caesar didn't get near Afghanistan.   He was also looking into and planning to avenge losses in the East when he was assassinated, I believe.
t1_ds1n8ca	1	*	did he give a big foreign policy speech saying that he wouldn't? because he gave a big foreign policy speech saying he'd stay in Afghanistan for as long as it takes 
t1_ds1jyvg	1	*	Lol
t1_ds1p58c	1	*	Wow so edgy, you must be so smart
t1_ds1k6to	1	*	$60k is not low and $100k is not middle for the most part.
t1_ds1fq9j	0	*	Your government has been harboring and providing refuge to ISIS and other terrorist groups for over a decade, so yes I think it's quite possible.
t1_ds1okjt	0	*	Why couldn't you just grow the fuck up and have a normal debate without lashing out at him like a 12 year-old? Jesus Christ. This argument reads like a middle school debate. Pathetic.
t1_ds1gzrc	0	*	Accurate. I have a lot of friends from that region and no one liked Saddam, but he was the best of a bad situation. 
t1_ds1p39c	1	*	except he hasn't stopped the flow of money
t1_ds1ormm	0	*	Why couldn't you have written that without the first or last sentences? Insults simply distract from the meat of your argument.
t1_ds2310q	0	*	I'm aware
t1_dtq16oq	0	*	I mean Arabs make up 20% of Israel's population and they hold positions in government, work as judges and as doctors and any other profession. But no rights, sure....
t1_dtskpiv	1	*	Jews and Arabs mainly. Some Ethiopian Jews are in the Knesset, so yeah a few black Africans.
t1_dtr15lr	1	*	> Israel bans marriage between people of different religions  No actually Israel just doesn't regulate marriage. It's a purely religious institution that the government has no hand in.
t1_dtq16lo	0	*	Israel is 20% Muslim, and they have equal rights. Christians, Samaritans, and Druze have equal rights too. 
t1_dtqrw7o	0	*	So this should be fine for you. After all borders are just a social construct.
t1_dtpzvk3	0	*	Some people have no grasp of the concept. Bringing in millions of people who are completely alien to your culture, society, language, and traditions will *surely* have long lasting implications
t1_dts8tu7	0	*	I don't get your reasoning. I can legally move to NL.  And if thousands can do it, it is easy, at least in Germany.
t1_dtr9353	0	*	Aside from all the exceptions, which are safer, more socially stable, and have a higher quality of life than the U.S., it doesn't work at all!
t1_dtrbksj	0	*	That was a mistranslation. The Hebrew word actually means Illegal Alien, specifically the kind who infiltrates the border rather than a visa overstay.
t1_du1078e	1	*	DId someone said israel?
t1_du38w08	0	*	Start a war, get fucked, don't cry.  Arabs are fucking snowflakes that blame the Jews for all their own failures. 
t1_du2h3ei	0	*	Im not talking about international law, Im talking about what you think the ethical obligation should be
t1_du1q0ae	0	*	Not if all the people are leaving as refugees 
t1_du2bym0	1	*	They weren't even shot down; they bailed out before they were.  By the accounts they were likely to be hit and it may have been the best idea, but none-the-less they crashed their own plane.
t1_du0zxth	0	*	Who violated whose airspace first? Pretty simple, don't you think? 
t1_du2m2ut	0	*	The syrians who are well known to have large amounts of chemical weapons could easily retaliate.  How bad is Israel when a nation known for gassing their own civillians has more restraint?
t1_du1cesp	0	*	Except that they're the brainchild of the US and China or Russia wouldn't have any gain in trying to own it, those countries are already successfully influencing Iran and Turkey
t1_du1mf08	1	*	Habibe inta!

t1_du0zynf	1	*	You can claim they're defending their airspace all you like, and that's not incorrect... however it absolutely does ZERO in regards to who was the aggressor here. Keep trying.
t1_du2z9gg	0	*	You do know Syria still considers itself at war with israel. Since 1948. They refuse to sit down for peace talks. 
t1_du11ykq	0	*	Nope. These israeli arabs are 84% Muslims  Get some education dude
t1_du139d0	1	*	We will do our best to expose the truth and prevent war from starting, take care brother.
t1_du1pyxn	0	*	Go back to /r/The_Donald

t1_dsmx7ok	0	*	Yes yes, I covered this in a subthread already. He said Often, not Majority of the time. However all my points hold, so I'll leave it be. 
t1_dspxfmr	0	*	As long as you get to play victim here that's all that matters. My passionate argument was that you were an idiot. I don't care how you choose to whine about it.
t1_dsr187s	0	*	....a *shirt*? He looks like a nerd? Dude, you're judging on appearances the exact same way you're accusing others of doing. Just cut your losses man
t1_dspznqz	1	*	Turns out it was a hoax.   So it is prudent to examine all the facts instead of blindly believing islamophobia is something that created this mess in the first place. 
t1_dspvwxo	0	*	Turns out, it gets even sadder the more times you spam me this lol.
t1_dsr0hu5	1	*	Exactly 
t1_dsnpa0z	0	*	Yes, that sounds like an unbiased source. /s
t1_dsnrkd3	0	*	Not true at all. Have laws but only if they can be found guilty beyond a shadow of doubt. Anything less and their good to go.

t1_dspkyad	0	*	Kekekekeke- Is this the sound of your shithole brain thinking?
t1_dspx4d2	0	*	Yes, and my response is that Canada is not immune to hate crime attacks against muslims, despite the number of hoaxes that have occurred. That seems to bother you.
t1_dsqbjhi	1	*	Don't forget the tiki torch!  They're not just for Nazis!
t1_dsnarf5	0	*	But the OP specifically said they were talking about the US...
t1_dsntujv	1	*	Sweden wont really change very much over the next few years though.

t1_dsqb8n0	0	*	Poe's law. Interesting, I'll look out up.
t1_dutz7zd	0	*	So you're confident the US wouldn't try to take out Kim if he gave up his nukes? Really? If you were in Kim's shoes you'd be willing to take that risk? 
t1_dusybpe	0	*	> Yes because we don't go to war with countries that often.  America has spent 222 out of the past 239 years at war.
t1_dusuy3n	0	*	Ahh, like how they work so closely with the Syrian government?
t1_duswmgm	0	*	I'd say that's nonsense and there's nothing the US has historically liked more than economically or physically fucking over communist countries. 
t1_dusxk5j	0	*	> Yes because we don't go to war with countries that often  For everyday of my life the US has been at war with someone , often several at once

t1_dtax51f	1	*	Could you specify what part was unclear? I honestly dont know how to ask it more clearly.
t1_dta969p	0	*	With bail you can either stay in jail or pay them the money that they then hold onto. It sounded like the cops just took the money.
t1_dtanpo7	1	*	Undercuts look damn good and I'll be damned if I let Nazis keep a good haircut from being a good haircut. Not letting those bastards take anything with them like many people's grandpa/great grandpa.
t1_dta2myv	0	*	 He's not 
t1_dtcb6nj	1	*	And way better to allow them to withdraw the money to pay their fine than to put them in jail until someone else pays for them. Way easier for both sides and you don't have to do it after all.
t1_dt9x74p	0	*	That also depends on what STEM. In engineering I would say its 20% memorization and the rest is just applications.

t1_dta627d	1	*	and what if they elect one instead of stopping him or her?
t1_dtaa189	1	*	She called a guy a Nazi based on his haircut.  Normally I would totally agree with you . The woman in this article  is not reasonable.

t1_dtan82t	1	*	Well i guess it depends on what was said.. different countries different triggers
t1_dta10pu	1	*	I did mean you, you are correct. But the implication is clear: new might as well mean Jews when changed by violent neo-nazis at a hate rally. 
t1_dta5n3x	1	*	Well it IS true. Ive seen it first hand. Ive also experienced it first hand. 
t1_dtahq2d	0	*	Offensive, sure, but not something that any judge should allow into their courtroom for legal retribution.  That *is* fascist.

t1_dta4qed	0	*	You're right, American police just wake up every day and look forward to shooting at minorities.
t1_dtacj63	1	*	Even if she does that, the court can deny her appeal without a trial  Edit: seems like thats only possible under specific circumstances. So she probably could get a real trial.
t1_dta37z1	1	*	Have fun. They will probably laugh at you.
t1_dtalvax	0	*	Okay but what they're called in America doesnt change where they actually are. Liberals are still centerists despite being called left in America

t1_dtaplo5	1	*	It genuinely scares me to see so many people in support of making it illegal to say certain things. 
t1_dtaa82b	0	*	(rolls eyes) Ok, I'm sure your politicians are upstanding people completely free from controversy because people and governments there are so completely different than they are here.

t1_dtaest5	0	*	>Your comments just don't sound honest  Can you point to any falsehoods in my comments?  >your motivations  Does motivation change whether a statement is factually correct?  
t1_dta5oji	0	*	Im not, though :)
t1_dtb5mo4	1	*	Let me reword it.   Just because its legal under German law doesnt make it a good law, and it doesnt make it above criticism. Northern Europeans love to tell Americans their gun laws are too loose.
t1_dta1ntd	1	*	It's hard to tell some days, Reddit is a silly place 
t1_dtc9jf5	0	*	German police can sue for getting called nazis lmao. Is that better your you? Or do you need Braille translation also
t1_dtabx4r	0	*	I am still not seeing where TD was cheering the Nazis showing up.   Most of what I saw were people distancing themselves as much as possible from them.

t1_dta58gf	1	*	There's no room for that kind of talk on reddit!
t1_dtabrwl	1	*	Except in Germany, Nazi is no mere degretory term. 
t1_dtaihzj	0	*	Yeah but you cant just impose what you want on a sovereign goddamn nation. If you dont like Germanys laws dont go to Germany. If you do, know that falsely calling someone a Nazi has consequences.

t1_dt9wuay	0	*	And Normandie is in?
t1_dtagstg	1	*	You're not making sense. These laws are there for the very reason to prevent something like the Nazis again. Read some other responses here about our Constitution. 
t1_dta5fys	1	*	These special interests are taking over the ideology of the major party. This is why there is a push back
t1_dta3r5k	1	*	Unfortunately I don't live in germany. I live in a country where cops kill whoever they want, whenever they want with no repercussions. Can you guess which country I live in?
t1_dtacvd4	1	*	You lie worse than Donald Trump and still think only Americans are stupid.
t1_dta0fog	0	*	'Handschuhschneeballwerfer' is one of my favorites -- it's compound, refers to gloves as hand shoes, and is also an idiom... all at the same time!

t1_dtabmo0	1	*	>It's just a thick paste. It's not solid is it, because then you wouldnt be able to use it.  You definitely could if it's pressed powder. Think talc.
t1_dta9z3p	1	*	Ah cool :)  Well thanks for explaining it. (Obviously the humor is gone, but I'll be able to appreciate it next time someone makes a similar remark :P)
t1_dta9owp	1	*	You could say they're... A-polexit-ic?   Fine it wasn't that good. You try to find a pun for apoplectic. 
t1_dtaas0o	0	*	Yeah thank god US stabilized Iraq, Afghanistan, Haiti, Syria, Iran, Chile, Guatemala, Vietnam.   
t1_dtadjgb	0	*	I'm not saying I insult cops like that, it's just I don't want the government tell me how I should act.

t1_dtaa01u	0	*	Is that why you seem to think they're similar to nazis?  Which group are you referring to?  
t1_dta34nw	1	*	I agree
t1_dt9ziz5	0	*	Okay? Thats relevant why?
t1_dtb8qzr	1	*	The best jokes are the ones that seem funny after further review
t1_dtasa1e	0	*	Not really relevant. The guy I responded to seemed to be implying that she was some sort of liberal snowflake. I don't know many liberal snowflakes who shill for drone strikes and torture.
t1_dta4fl3	0	*	No, defense spending is actually really low at about 1,3% of GDP. Last time I checked the US was close to 4%.
t1_dta60qd	0	*	And? You said they were in a minority by not voting for Trump. That is factually incorrect.
t1_dt9y0sk	0	*	All I have to memorise is every episode of rick and morty
t1_dt9xpj1	0	*	I am including those that sell drugs and are incarcerated for long periods of time. 
t1_dta8hwj	0	*	Than it was a misunderstanding. I thought the passenger know the consequences as in what the military responds in the US would be. 
t1_dt9xfem	1	*	The point is no matter how much you pretend it is, it stops being fun after the first million or so times
t1_dtaa9lq	1	*	I'd like to buy your rock.
t1_dtawpj3	1	*	McD has repeatedly refused to lower the temperature to one wich still brews coffe but isn't nearly as dangerous. They acted like massive dicks in court, wich is why the fine got so big
t1_dta6wiu	0	*	AGREED, BUT I AM NOT CHANGING MY HOSTILE TONE!!!!   ;-p
t1_dta91v9	1	*	But we're back to back football champs for 51 years.
t1_dtar3da	0	*	ThEnStAyAwAyIfYoUaReThAtDuMb. Again, what makes you different from a facist? Cause you come off as one.
t1_dta3id6	0	*	Formal logic is basically coding but with your brain instead of a computer tbh. And lots of epistemology/metaphysics professors come from a background in physics, so ya you're right
t1_dt9xo1b	1	*	yeah bro just ignore racism
t1_dta2g89	0	*	Do I not fit your dumb racist narrative? 20 black people(unarmed) were killed last year. That's is 0.001% of police interactions and more white people were killed anyways. 
t1_dtaow5r	0	*	This is the lamest effortpost I've seen in a while
t1_dt9zzea	0	*	Sure. 
t1_dtb7rff	1	*	And you don't serve it at the boiling point.
t1_dtame57	1	*	Not from an American.
t1_dtaelll	0	*	They pay settlements because they were in the wrong legal wise.. That actually strengthens and proves my point.
t1_dt9tulj	0	*	>When was the last time that you called a random stranger a [...] fucking bastard?  This happens every nights in every city in the UK.
t1_dtacmhz	1	*	Dont give me credit. Its actually a copypasta.  Edit: Again?!
t1_dta5jpo	0	*	I guess there's the cultural difference. Death threats of any kind are illegal in germany, and aside from a few right wing AfD fascists you won't find many people who think otherwise
t1_dtay8q4	0	*	Im guessing youre talking about conservative Americans and Nordic politics?
t1_dta0eit	0	*	It's not even about words being offensive it's about giving people, who would harm others based on who they are, a platform to spread their hate.
t1_dtao2c6	1	*	In my country the Liberal Party is right wing. Guess that means everyone right wing in America hat because liberal. 
t1_dta5tdp	0	*	Because I'm asking people to back up their claims?
t1_dtc6t9u	0	*	say something else predictable and pathetic
t1_dta4bpc	0	*	One time I used a Sience to talk to ghosts.
t1_dtafq3w	0	*	It could be both really. It's thrown around way too much on reddit
t1_dta6kfs	0	*	Meaningless drivel.    
t1_dtaifl8	0	*	In many stages, possessing marijuana is a felony
t1_dtae7x8	0	*	You made a claim with exactly nothing backing it up. So unless you're a psychic or had several well reasoned arguments hidden up your ass for no reason that is exatly the argument you made. 
t1_dtar9ke	0	*	I'll repeat, we were talking about the US in this thread. All of my comments so far have referred specifically to the US. You jumped in without understanding the context.
t1_dta8o0l	0	*	So really it's a deposit rather than a fine. Pretty sure if I acted like that in the US, they wouldn't allow me to leave the country without paying up.
t1_dtab6de	0	*	You can be liberal and have people call you that. Regardless of political views. Just have blond hair/blue eyes and I will pretty much guarantee it will happen.
t1_dta70zq	0	*	Dutch humour I love it. Also how are the dykes looking? North sea still at bay?
t1_dtabxpy	1	*	http://ec.europa.eu/immigration/bluecard_en
t1_dt9zpyq	1	*	Oh, I see
t1_dta7ksu	0	*	I'm not involved in a witch hunt. I just don't tolerate people who claim Hitler might have had a good reason to kill the Jews.
t1_dtc0kqw	0	*	Shows how little you know about the subject, yet you make such extreme claims.  Inform yourself.
t1_dta2i75	1	*	Then who else should be responsible to define those standards?
t1_dtacha6	0	*	> regularly broke the law,  But not threatening violence. If they were threatening violence, the police would have said that.
t1_dtaiwhg	1	*	I'm just saying it's pretty Nazi like of them to punish people for calling them Nazis. 
t1_dtbmep4	1	*	Not according to the EU parliament either.   And we're talking proof of genocide, not proof of mass murder. 
t1_dtaar91	0	*	I haven't found any evidence that they did, but maybe I've missed that one source that the Wikipedia article missed.
t1_dtarnyu	0	*	I see no difference. I love how you so called enlightened and welcoming people revert and go straight to insults. Pity, but not surprised.
t1_dtar9jz	0	*	So you're admitting to me that you're evading a ban right now?
t1_dta7fw7	1	*	I am German and it happened to me too. 
t1_dtam0hk	0	*	> Right, but today, Poland's a fucking embarrassment   I would say Germany is the fucking embarrassment considering its migration policies, and the E.U. is going to collapse in time anyway
t1_dt9yagt	0	*	Ive already explained why youre wrong, now youre just repeating yourself.   Conversations over. Learn some fucking history. 
t1_dta71e6	0	*	My bloodline is full of pirates so I cant negate that one. On the other hand, you are American as well.
t1_dta2a5o	1	*	Tell ya what, about halfway through the last year of my Immunology degree, that History degree was looking pretty tempting.
t1_dta4x02	0	*	The DoD is the second largest employer in the world, after the Chinese army (which does more than just defence) and ahead of the NHS and Walmart.  Defence is definitely something the US overspends on.
t1_dtbikm6	0	*	Every shot fired warrants investigation. But not necessarily media coverage.
t1_dtap0rh	1	*	.....Ouch. That's good.
t1_dtb9pmt	0	*	I'll take fine over getting shot for 500 please. 
t1_dtabq9y	1	*	Did you speak with Germans how they feel about their history? To me it seems like you just went to the museums and just made up your own narative.
t1_dta7276	1	*	...META
t1_dtaavrm	1	*	wait, you found a phone book in 2018? that's the bigger news here.

t1_dta0eo7	1	*	*Harumph*  I'd place my inheritance on a lofty wager suggesting that you use a toaster for your Pop-Tartsxae, do you not? Ghastly
t1_dta8j7t	1	*	Yeah after his answer to mine I got that too. Classical misunderstanding. 
t1_dtadrys	1	*	To say there aren't many Americans like that seems like an understatement. Yes, they are loud but they are sadly not few.
t1_dtcae4w	1	*	HAIL TRUMP LMFAO
t1_dta578o	1	*	See, you are displaying intelligence here in observing the situation, taking in all the facts and then post a conclusion based on your thorough observation.  Well done!  
t1_dtakt4r	1	*	That's probably more accurate.
t1_dtaggp2	1	*	Ich spui mit der Oidn!
t1_dt9zo5i	1	*	Lol more like 1000% bullshit... 
t1_dtbl4tx	0	*	Nice, thank you for explaining.
t1_dta23b1	0	*	Wait, seriously? Austrian kangaroo farmers hold them for the meat? I didn't know that, I always thought they were just novelty pets. 
t1_dta00x0	1	*	They never had the enlightenment apparently. Freedom of speech is only a thing as long as it's not offensive. 
t1_dtammkg	0	*	Umm, are you asking me to explain my sarcastic struggle to you? Another man trying to exploit free work from a minority. I choose not to enact that labor, educate yourself pig.
t1_dta2gvv	0	*	Misusing a single word constitutes as can barely speak English?

t1_dszo9d9	1	*	If they had teeth people might care

t1_dszm2gw	0	*	> and not killing or harming anyone in the process.  I see you've never picked up a history book
t1_dszmrlz	1	*	And I wouldn't associate any particular region within America to them either.
t1_dszlh0t	0	*	I don't really care what the UN says
t1_dszqm1i	1	*	Other bigger countries and states with oil are the same, but dont have the investment size. And money is money, the money you get from social security can just as easily buy stocks.
t1_dt09rs7	0	*	Didn't see much in the UK. Most young people read the news rather than watching it. 
t1_dszjau8	1	*	Se eu me recusar, sou expulso da Amxe9rica?
t1_dszidzs	0	*	>I'll sacrifice some karma to hopefully teach someone to be less lazy.  Nah you just wanted to be a dick.
t1_dszmudy	1	*	Yes. The US forced a constitution with a symbolic emperor on Japan after we beat them in World War II.
t1_dt0965f	1	*	I agree. I actually didn't even expect anyone to respond seriously to my comment. 
t1_dt049d0	1	*	> When blind the surgeon kills the patient don't blame the scalpels.  The death of one man is a tragedy,  the death of a million is a statistic - Joseph Stalin.  
t1_dt07wwr	1	*	Its absolutely disgusting schools are still allowed to promote filth like abstinence only over actually doing their jobs and educating students. 
t1_dszl8b2	1	*	Thanks you so much. Truly a hero.
t1_dt04747	1	*	How can you make such a judgement? YouTube deletes anything that is not tranquil. All you can say is that they are not currently filming someone being raped in that train cart at that time. 
t1_dszme14	1	*	I don't even care I love when people do that. Also love the fact you kept the graph in so they could look at it before it ended. If I wasn't broke I'd give you gold. 
t1_dt0a1lg	0	*	Not football? College and pro?
t1_dszyxou	0	*	Agreed. Thanks for assuming I meant otherwise.
t1_dszpo0i	1	*	Lol all of their posts are pure gold.  Thank you,
t1_duox819	0	*	He's just another warlord in history.  His genius was convincing people that an Angel spoke to him and he was a messenger of God.
t1_dsgq6za	0	*	Mujahid, holy warrior, but good on obfuscation.
t1_dsbn3n7	0	*	Compared to how many Mao has starved? Peanuts
t1_dsbq7rm	0	*	It's pretty much true homie. Look at the number of Chinese trying to get to America. Then compare that to the number of Americans trying to get to China. It's clear which country is preferable. 
t1_dv4zz1r	0	*	It was listed as refugees and asylum seekers, there are no significant numbers of Christian or hindu asylum seekers, I was being sarcastic because almost every refugee is a muslim.
t1_dumw6my	0	*	Yeah well industrial social media manipulation is a fact. It is part of our current society.
t1_dumrja2	1	*	That was exactly my point!
t1_dumu7al	0	*	Look at how we ammend it and grow up.
t1_ds76n2w	0	*	I asked you a few questions before you asked one of me here, if you answer those I'll point out parts of my previous responses which answer the question you just asked and I'll elaborate on that.
t1_ds23f4j	1	*	Its law breaking down, not an armed offensive.  Dramatic as hell lol
t1_ds20wtu	0	*	Who was she used by?
t1_ds3wyc4	1	*	Oh Im sorry, I didnt realise you had learning difficulties. My bad.
t1_ds2ma93	1	*	Ah, yes, the soldier simply saw a kid and thought, Let's make my life incredibly difficult by trying to arrest him because I think he looks funny!
t1_ds20cus	1	*	They're forcibly serving to the armed forces so it's a different case I guess.

t1_du8lg15	1	*	Of course it will effect food production and cause famine, i never disputed that.
t1_dsepxfq	0	*	You seriously didn't know that? 
t1_duab7o6	0	*	Categorically, in this context, yes.  Both are distractions and nonsense and have no place in the discussion. 
t1_dubkjxn	1	*	Reading difficult for you?
t1_duad52n	0	*	What am I salty about?  Bernie lost and Trump won!
t1_duadfi4	0	*	Which one?
t1_duafu9o	0	*	Assange straight up says they have info on Trump right there. He just makes up a lame excuse why they haven't released it. But keep sucking Trump's tiny dick
t1_du98118	1	*	Bravo.... you nailed it!  
t1_duqrvw7	1	*	Check. Mate. 
t1_duqddfv	0	*	Mitch McConnell being one the worst people in congress EVER.  That motherfucker is Strom-Thurmond-level vile, and history will not be kind to him.  
t1_duqorpl	1	*	If you think US civilians could stand up to Russia, China, the UN, or even Japan without our own military intervening, you're fucking retarted. 
t1_duqntvu	0	*	Manager making you work after hours. You'll probably burn this account and hop on another soon. They can see what you are.
t1_duqhzb1	0	*	*rolls eyes*  So many folks with guns smoke weed. You're not wrong but you're being pedantic. I'll just ghost Gunner a lower receiver so I don't have to fill out any form.
t1_duqlikc	1	*	God. People like you guys are the only reason Im still sane. How are people so ignorant that they dont see one side being played against the other.  
t1_duq9r60	0	*	So they didn't want her to win. 
t1_duqf3wa	0	*	So tell me, in what reality is the truth known without knowing all of the facts? 
t1_duqg0gw	1	*	Thats true. When you put it that way it makes sense.
t1_duqbvad	1	*	Very true
t1_duqonft	0	*	Well I hate to say it, but I think another revolution for Russia may be in order. Putin clearly does nobody any favors. That kind of instability for a nuclear power is scary though.
t1_duq782j	0	*	It tells you why the following right was ~~granted~~ recognized. Because a militia is necessary to the security of the free state.
t1_duq6v0m	0	*	There were certainly Clinton supporters there, but that cannot change the election.
t1_duqaqh8	0	*	Do you have a source on that? Not disagreeing, just would love to read the research. 
t1_duqb0yu	1	*	> Banning assault rifles and limiting magazine capacity to 10 is what many would consider to be banning guns.  Cool, theyre idiots who are overreacting on purpose

t1_duqew5y	1	*	One of the worst goddamn motherfucking cocksuckers in US history!! I hope he dies of painful chin, neck, ball, and dick cancer!!
t1_duq8exz	1	*	It means properly-functioning
t1_durqyzs	1	*	The last time someone tried it FDR nearly lost the presidency over it.   Incredibly unpopular move, the executive branch trying to fuck with another should be grounds for immediate dismissal. 
t1_duq9ty8	1	*	It would be BetterCanada.
t1_duq8kjz	0	*	Its also fun to watch the right pretend everyone else is the fascists 
t1_duq9tqj	0	*	So you will admit it's too easy to buy a gun in general?
t1_duq71ee	0	*	Hahaha. You just made my day. Cheers mate  edit: Kid edited his above statement, he said, and I'm not kidding, reported. You can't make this shit up. 
t1_duq6h9f	0	*	Fine then, Ron Jeremy. 
t1_duqbs78	1	*	You laddy!
t1_duqaq31	0	*	Can we use real words here though? Assault rifles are already illegal. We're talking about rifles here. Obama wanted to ban a large category of *rifles*. 
t1_duq7c8u	0	*	>most things aren't black and white  That and an increasing tendency for people on both sides to treat their political allegiance like supporting a football team and root for it to win at any cost.
t1_duqq5u2	0	*	You literally made that fact up.
t1_duqa60v	1	*	Because that's simply what they want it to mean. 
t1_duqc9b3	0	*	I'm not smart enough to understand why you called out the Jews related to trade.  
t1_duqbst9	1	*	Swap little regard to zero regard and it will be perfect
t1_duq6z4x	1	*	How about James Earl Jones?
t1_duqbc0u	1	*	Maybe it's more like a Donner Party.
t1_duqi226	1	*	Wow you are so creative and funny
t1_duqa9z4	0	*	You still can't drink of you're in possession of a firearm. They changed this law so that people could still go to Applebee's or whatever and eat with their family.
t1_duqhd0j	1	*	They should have forced it.  It would have solved so many problems, while concentrating the election on civil rights issues instead of apathy and gossip.
t1_duqi3qe	1	*	Thanks!
t1_duqjpta	1	*	The rest of the SCOTUS hates him.   According to Nina Totenburg, they all think he's an asshole, none of them respect him at all, and he's turning Roberts into a liberal.
t1_duqcpuo	1	*	Cool, see you in a month!
t1_duq9y7u	0	*	No they were being directed by our own government
t1_duq8wal	1	*	Oh this USA Apology Tour is going to rock so hard.

t1_duqk6pe	1	*	Yeahh no popular vote is very important. It's pretty embarrassing for him to have a pathetic year and also he's about to be jailed for his crimes. 
t1_duqqfbq	1	*	Lose... what?   The chance to keep conversing with a hypocritical troll? Oh my, how will I ever survive? 
t1_duqbtxa	0	*	So would you consider the DPRK a super power just because they have nukes?
t1_duqazoo	1	*	Ah ok that makes a ton of sense. Thanks
t1_duq8n5g	1	*	America was British once too. 
t1_duq9oyu	0	*	Here's me caring:
t1_duqcyyf	0	*	You're basing your claim on what exactly? I could say x has 0 integrity about anyone and that doesn't make it true. 
t1_duqfukf	0	*	Which campaign advisor was tapped due to the dossier? The one that has been tapped since 2013 or the ones that just caught 30 indictments?
t1_duquo48	0	*	Jesus you must be dense
t1_duq90xq	1	*	My local place deep fries these big fat curds. Its mind blowing.
t1_duqdbn2	0	*	The Republicans disallowing Obama to nominate a SOC Justice was a constitutional crisis, too.
t1_duqb12n	1	*	Alright. Your comment makes it sound like you're responding to the statement  One is a felony. One is not.
t1_duq60tm	0	*	Troll harder. You aren't even trying anymore. 
t1_duqa86h	0	*	Mainly because the shit the CIA does down there to destabilize countries. 
t1_duq91qj	0	*	Do you have trouble with English? Would you like an ELI5?
t1_duqew9m	1	*	The problem is they dont give a shit and their voted base was supporting what they did.  
t1_duq6get	0	*	Hence, consolation for lack of an American celeb.
t1_dur7qyk	1	*	The thing that gets me is if the roles were reversed, you know the republicans wouldn't have thought twice to do exactly this. They would never, ever let the dems get away with the crap they pull.
t1_duq9jt5	0	*	[You](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/096/564/2f7.jpg)

t1_duqekfa	1	*	Of America? 
t1_duqg9bw	1	*	Weve been fighting wars without the consent of Congress since the Korean War. I dont see how this would have been much worse. 
t1_duqnzbk	0	*	You don't see to understand that there is no return on investment for donations. You're describing investments.
t1_duqdv3r	1	*	They don't give a shit really, it's about making bank.
t1_dv64hxr	1	*	Tonight, you.
t1_duqa2tn	1	*	I think the most likely answer is just that this is what they *want* it to mean. 
t1_duqpbm3	0	*	I dont think this is an outlier. This speech was no more a payment for influence than the dozens of other speeches Clinton was similarly compensated for. 
t1_duqkt25	1	*	Well there most likely were Russian bots stirring up shit after the shooting. What's your point?
t1_duqd4vv	1	*	The germans realised a change in tactics was in order to finally dominate Europe.   It's a lot easier to conquer someone when they are ok with it.   Consenting Anschluxdf
t1_duq7uog	0	*	No wait!  I'll split all profits.  Our secret. 
t1_duq8y18	0	*	I 100% agree. Unfortunately, about 30% of my countrymen are functionally retarded. 
t1_duqbagz	0	*	There's a sales tax on purchase like all other physical goods. I'm not sure what you're talking about though.
t1_duq9vir	0	*	What about banning drugs? Would the death from drugs drop?
t1_duugeci	0	*	No.. argument from authority would be if you had any experience in a remotely close field. At least you admit your actually engaged in using a fallacy. Good for you....
t1_duqros7	1	*	You mean Turtle Man
t1_duqac16	1	*	Yeah, i would love to see what the history books will say about this.
t1_duqbcrf	0	*	Dosent stop Trump and Fox from bringing her up. The boogieman isnt real but that dosen't stop kids from having nightmares about him.
t1_duqc3gu	0	*	It makes them a potential threat, but they would be destroyed if they launched nukes first. The world at large isn't going to let anyone get away with starting a nuclear war.
t1_duqlutw	1	*	Thats...the point of the senate.  It represents the states, not the people.  That's what the HoR is for.
t1_duqzvlx	0	*	Why didn't they allow you Indian food?
t1_duqf3ri	1	*	This is one of the better responses that see both parties as failures that ive read today.
t1_duq6y15	1	*	Yea and Mike Myers is Canadian. Good one!
t1_duqcfe6	1	*	literally this.
t1_duqnynr	0	*	You act like Jimmy Kimmel has zero influence over the American public when coupled with John Oliver, Stephen Colbert, Bill Maher, CNN, MSNBC, Washington Post, New York Times, etc
t1_duqfznc	1	*	thank you :D i agree!
t1_duqhc62	1	*	I hear your request and respectfully refuse. 
t1_duqbpf4	1	*	Not sure how it is now, but I was living in Calgary for a couple years leading up to the election. There was a ton of support for Trump. 
t1_duqa0pa	1	*	Gladly. Plenty of people who have decided to break all laws as you say would probably like to get their hands on a nuke. There are certain laws that make that quite difficult, though. Laws work
t1_duq8dox	1	*	Well maybe the Left can compromise since they don't seem to care about civil liberties.
t1_duqggd5	1	*	I think he is probably one of the worst people. Period.
t1_duqggds	1	*	Um...yep. Same with any world power.   They're also the other major world arms producer/seller
t1_duqdqka	1	*	Apparently, it makes people feel better to pretend otherwise...
t1_duquty2	1	*	But it was *her turn*!
t1_dur2vfd	0	*	So it was health care costs driving jobs overseas?
t1_duq7od1	0	*	You legit seem very upset. 
t1_duqdnh5	1	*	The comment Im glad somebody beat me to. Exactly this.
t1_duqmjh5	0	*	Show us the proof 
t1_duqhhbb	1	*	Republicans would have done it in a heartbeat.  Edit: and there would have been zero consequences.
t1_durfd3o	1	*	Then you should probably see a doctor about getting that stick removed from your ass.
t1_duqef1j	1	*	Lol, that's funny.
t1_duqc24i	1	*	Because they are willfully denying reality.
t1_duqddlh	0	*	Yep, that's why the best course of action is to get the hell out of this embarrassment of a country before it collapses.

t1_duq6gk8	1	*	Yes, but we'll be paying him to do it.  The American way!
t1_duqf6fu	1	*	Yay I might have worded it wrong if you thought I was saying it that way. It was more pointed at that poster and others saying that based off your post.  Sorry for the confusion.

t1_durt9go	1	*	The same china that wiped out millions of their own citizens? THAT china? (seriously, have you never heard of Mao?)  Or are you referring to modern capitaism/communism hybrid china?
t1_dur0go4	1	*	That's very unsocialist

t1_durafyn	0	*	For some measure of functional.

t1_dsgu959	1	*	Ahhh, I didn't know that and missed the joke...
t1_dsfdk48	1	*	British citizen here. Churchill was not a pleasant man, but he was the kind of unpleasant man we needed to defeat Hitler. Go do some reading.
t1_dsglwx3	1	*	Interesting how you are so willing to cast dispersions upon victims.
t1_dshwbkf	0	*	What makes you believe it was deliberate? For the same reason we don't call the Dust Bowl deliberate, it's unwise to make every bad thing that happens a product of ill-meaning man.
t1_dsgfxbz	0	*	Are you trying to say it was a good thing for the Jacobins to torture and murder French and other wypipo for their religious beliefs?
t1_dsfzxxj	0	*	JFC what a brilliant piece of historical yoga..  
t1_ds3mhad	0	*	Being nice isn't what charisma means, the fact you have to say negative things is a prime reason charisma is hugely important.
t1_ds2uzo1	1	*	I never get mad (or embarrassed) when I'm right.
t1_ds3mqy6	0	*	Charisma is in itself the art of saying a negative thing in a way that comes off positive, though.

t1_dsp0xnz	0	*	Dont cut yourself on that edge, you wouldnt be able to afford the medical bills
t1_dsp9jal	1	*	The two dozen people with matching stories of him being a rapey pervert are a good place to start.  The multiple recordings of him bragging about being a rapey pervert would probably suffice as well.

t1_dskoczj	1	*	> Trump defended free speech not nazis?  He said that There are good people on both sides, when asked about the neo-nazis. How does that relate to free speech at all?
t1_dskq6yg	0	*	I didn't get to that. You did.
t1_dsknfc7	0	*	You're barking up the wrong tree, this Republican is entirely in support of planned parenthood and abortion, and understands it's not meant to kill babies but keep them out of bad situations.
t1_dsknua8	1	*	Except there's a two term limit in NYC and for the city council (unless the pull a Bloomberg and did a one  -time waiver even though voters have twice rejected that)

t1_dsm5njq	0	*	You really don't get this do you?
t1_dsko001	1	*	I mean, if it were up to me, we wouldn't. Trust me, you'll find no defense of the liberal establishment's terrible decisions in political messaging here. 
t1_dskti1t	0	*	Much better than Jews will not replace us and blood and soil right?
t1_dskot2m	0	*	His answer was sarcasm because Chicago has some of the strictest gun laws in the country, and they fail all the goddamn time.

t1_dsksty4	0	*	It's not an eye for an eye, because he took more than we could ever take from him. I think that reflects the racism of Norway. They want to keep him alive because he's one of them-- a white man.
t1_dskotlz	0	*	Except in embassies and their environs..  The concern was that any attack on the old embassy could have impacted civilians quite seriously
t1_dskqffo	0	*	So youre attacking cnn for misreporting facts that you refuse to specify.   Ok. I think Im done here. 
t1_dskozpu	1	*	It was a huge deal in 2000, last time the popular vote winner lost the electoral college. Its obviously not seen as a problem when the electoral college sinks up with the popular vote.
t1_dskx591	1	*	That got sexy really fast.
t1_dskqpg5	1	*	Yes, I completely understand, I just don't agree that that's a good policy.
t1_dsm66vd	1	*	What are you chatting about? They don't carry any money, what are they going to do, steal the fucking bus?
t1_dslnt3r	1	*	They're only mad *because* it's working as intended. They very much want to steamroll smaller more conservative states.
t1_dskzl33	0	*	The Electoral College in general sucks, dosent matter who benefits from it.
t1_dskrkvl	0	*	You never called me a cunt and I never called you dumb as shit. You aren't reading usernames.   Also, I don't have anything for which I need your forgiveness. 
t1_dskyu19	1	*	All of the information that I consider relevant reinforces my opinion too. Must be a coincidence.
t1_dsktcgc	1	*	>93% chance of it happening? Remember?  Why do you lie? Is it because your argument sucks? 538 had the election at around 60-40 which is a margin of error toss-up. 
t1_dspuk2x	1	*	When you can't speak Human to someone you will have to resort to more base forms of communication...
t1_dskt0wc	0	*	Did you honestly just edit that to make me look like a tit? This comment said something about buildings being made of cotton not even a minute ago.

t1_dskp686	1	*	Both.
t1_dslhucl	1	*	Weren't there 450 acid attacks last year alone in london? Sure it's still unlikely to happen to you if you live there since the population is large, but london is not without its safety issues...
t1_dskvj54	1	*	And now spending 20 minutes reading every comment in this thread became entirely worth it. Thank you mate.
t1_dskpdwn	0	*	Wow.  Imagine that:  healthcare provided (at a reasonable price) to the people who need it.  Such a stark contrast to how we handle things in the states.
t1_dskxr4h	1	*	Ill wait...

t1_dskni6a	1	*	Pro tip. That'll be why he's not in your media much.

t1_dskn6t2	1	*	Well it's why I hate the French but nobody's getting mad at them.
t1_dsksbqk	0	*	You could always move to Minnesota and have the shitty country with the shitty climate to match. Windchills hit -74 in some parts of the state earlier this month.
t1_dskrm8q	0	*	Are you blasian? Cause then it would be split based on if asians are viewed as basically white on the day of the protest.
t1_dskqt3i	1	*	No, it features paraphrasing of the second half of the quote. The part and parcel part is the author's claim outside of the quote.  Don't get upset, you'll get reading down one day bud!
t1_dsl19jf	0	*	> Get a glass of water... for this red pill.  Hahahahaha yeah I'm not listening to anything you have to say after that

t1_du7espr	0	*	Hey don't get cocky with me. I heard your point. I don't agree with you. 
t1_duaefqf	0	*	Yes, your weak assertions will surely convince this hypothetical person. It appears you live in a virtual reality not only when it concerns politics

t1_du7aq5r	0	*	Then write better gun laws rather than complain the ones we have are bad? I don't get it.
t1_du8fqsc	0	*	Is so much more that I simply can't say it all here. My point is that he shouldn't say it like he did.

t1_du7quhl	1	*	Then I guess it's a good thing I used the past tense isn't it?  Historical context is important.
t1_du949a0	0	*	So you have no research and you decided instead to contradict yourself.
t1_du7rx21	1	*	Yeah, you can totally sum up over a hundred years of history in the region with a short sentence.
t1_du7q7dg	0	*	Native Americans are a super minority and haven't been the majority for hundreds of years. I guess they have no right to live there.
t1_du7b9wu	0	*	Oh the comment you edited as I was replying?  Sounds like some kind of conspiracy going on.  Are you deep state?
t1_du7dhdc	0	*	It's absolutely not, but ok. Keep spouting your stupid propaganda.
t1_du8k93o	0	*	So genocide of Jewish people is chill because the British took over Palestine from the ottomans? 
t1_du86mp5	1	*	Just burn it to the ground like they did to Alexandria. Like a bad parent, sometimes heritage needs to be abandoned or destroyed.
t1_du7jeet	0	*	Deportation, not extermination. Still horrible but come on, don't exaggerate.

t1_du7ap2a	0	*	also people don't have an addiction to guns like they do to drugs (well, most people). The war on drugs doesn't work because its a medical issue and an addiction.
t1_du8yo0k	0	*	I don't disagree about Hamas, I just think Israel should be held to a higher standard than a terrorist organization.
t1_du7xatb	0	*	So a person trying to kill 100 children but failing due to incompetence is morally better than a person who is trying to kill 1 and succeeds? 
t1_du7bxag	0	*	Yeah well nether does Hamas. What's Mahmoud Abbas up to these days?
t1_dsgnnh8	1	*	That's nice.
t1_dsgpzah	0	*	How has it held us back? And do you know anything about the dark ages, as they're called, because the church hardly controlled anything. If they had any power it was the power to protect people.
t1_dsevnrs	0	*	You're pretty dense
t1_dsfe8uz	0	*	Do you have an example of what you're talking about?
t1_dsfs0rw	0	*	Right now the pope seems more science positive than the political leaders of the USA the global superpower. 
t1_dsgn8kk	0	*	And why do you need religion for that? You do realize that these things happened all around the world without religion, right? Often before it happened in the West: See China, Korea, etc.
t1_dsfxo25	0	*	Secular societies can't even maintain a stable birth rate. Our species would be dying out if it wasn't for religious nations and their obsolete, nostalgic insistence on having children.
t1_ds7ripe	0	*	Exactly what I thought. You don't have shit. Bye bye.
t1_ds7vwdm	1	*	Blah blah blah. Say what you really mean, that we should blow them to smithereens.
t1_ds85pby	0	*	With whom are you expecting Europe to have a strong friendship if not the current oppressive regime?   Aren't you aware that such friendship would only bolster the regime? 
t1_ds802ro	1	*	All those things you listed happened under the current government. You're making my point for me.
t1_dt87ebx	1	*	Lmao!! 
t1_dt96ftx	0	*	<3 my stalkers
t1_dt8sn9f	1	*	Oh great strategy, attack the source instead of the content. 
t1_dtqf9oy	0	*	In other words, you're too lazy to provide evidence, or you're just talking out of your ass.   Also, he isn't the one that argued with you.
t1_dtq82xp	0	*	Omg no. but everyone can find a job eventually. Im talking people going years doing nothing.
t1_dsxlqhy	0	*	Quite the read. The beautiful thing is that no one died. Planes are awesome.  About the underwear, it wasn't the fear, but the Gs that pushed it out ;)  The pilot couldn't lift his fucking arms.
t1_dsypqqj	1	*	Nausea, headaches and seizures remind me of the supposed sonic weapon attacks in Cuba.

t1_dseqb87	1	*	My mistake, well spotted. I'll update the original comment.  0.05% is still 1 in 2000 though.
t1_dscreml	0	*	How much is their wage? I have no problem with work. I have a problem with exploitation of labor and theft of surplus value. Wage slavery is still slavery.
t1_dscuvse	0	*	Yeah. Kindof ranted a bit longer then I wanted. And dont like beating dead horses. It just was really irritating me. 
t1_dscy632	0	*	>another platform could potentially rise and take over.  This could be a good thing. If we're licky(e: I meant lucky haha) several platforms would be started and we might get some actual competition.
t1_dsd2v80	1	*	Because You must be 18 or older to view this content. has worked so well in the past.

t1_dsd7enp	0	*	Australian here. $285/month sounds like heaven. I guess Im moving to the US/s 
t1_dsd4hr1	1	*	Gotta make drama if you have none.
t1_dsczys2	0	*	Try finding a single source claiming Foxconn doesn't play its workers overtime. If that's the case, western media would already have blown it over 1000 times over.
t1_dsdirii	1	*	Got ya. I'm just tired of seeing all the feels over facts. This entire thread is filled with  unsubstantiated bullshit, and I'm calling it out. Nothing personal.
t1_dsdc026	0	*	I don't live in black and white. Now tell me how I'm being hypocritical.
t1_dscwfib	0	*	Also, financial stability plays a large role in suicide risk.
t1_dscvj91	1	*	Im trying to melt it
t1_dscwvhl	0	*	Were talking about such a varied group of people in both cases where it becomes utterly fucking irrelevant, yes. 300,000 people is a small city.
t1_dsddysy	1	*	Actually $285/mo is defijitely doable in most of the US... not in the places you actually wanna live, but for every Greenwich theres Ohio.
t1_dsd1kkr	0	*	I'm not paying to heat the whole damn world now. 
t1_dscwo7u	1	*	+1 for saying letting the heat out vs. letting the cold in

t1_dta6de9	1	*	Glad you enjoyed it. It's definitely out there.
t1_duj2u28	0	*	I thought you knew all about it. Remember how you told me I knew nothing about it, at all? Surely, you would know the answer to this question, if you see fit to ridicule me on my knowledge...
t1_duqs4pv	0	*	There's that anger and the true motivation behind your post. Easier than I expected. XD  You are the source of your problems. Clearly your expensive education didn't teach you some basic syntax. 
t1_durrcl0	1	*	Nigeria is doing a damn good job getting rid of polio. Hopefully other countries follow suit.
t1_dur1elr	0	*	The fact that my point is different from yours doesn't negate it. 
t1_dt9i60e	1	*	>Maybe get some basic education.  Says the person who isn't smart enough to know pain research on invertebrates.
t1_duys1px	0	*	The same guy that managed to lose money on a casino, declared bankruptcy multiple times, and has a reputation for not paying contractors?  Yeah, I'm confident he would need some liquid capital.
t1_duyv75k	0	*	Must have been something pretty serious to risk jail time.

t1_duzd7qk	1	*	> anything meaningful at all  Edit: I have done as you are now requesting u/marci__ Links are now added to my post. Looking forward to your structured and informed response. 
t1_duz0bkp	0	*	Lol might wanna Google it yourself. Snopes says FALSE. 
t1_duylls3	0	*	I just don't understand your original comment. It is a run-on sentence.
t1_duyyarn	1	*	Well that remains to be seen, but it's obvious he doesn't put up with shit and that alone is refreshing.  Even if I disagreed with him on policies, I would listen to what he has to say.
t1_duys5ji	0	*	Well let's see this video then. 
t1_duyykf4	0	*	This right here.  He's no longer conservative enough to win the nomination, especially if all this leads to Trump getting impeached.  The extreme right wing will make him out to be an enemy.  
t1_duypkg9	0	*	you're still down voting me though, lol.  I don't care. whatever.
t1_duyukjs	0	*	Since you called it false, I'm assuming you must have some sources.  It's not about guilt, this isn't a court of law.  You made a claim, back it up.  Sources?
t1_duyvafj	1	*	But his emails!
t1_duykt11	0	*	LOL, I love how you just ignored Trump Jr. getting political dirt in exchange for removing Russian sanctions.  
t1_duymjhl	1	*	I would imagine it's more like reading an elder scroll.
t1_duzs5h6	0	*	You're right. I'm just dismayed at the realization. Sorry if that wasn't what came across.
t1_duym24z	0	*	I dont think Mueller is about all the political bullshit that would go along with a run. 
t1_duyqsf9	1	*	And did you not post, just yesterday, that you're going to vote for trump in 2020? 
t1_duyquld	1	*	the image is obviously a child wearing a ghost costume, I really think they are making a big deal out of nothing.
t1_duyj4aq	0	*	again why do u lefties think racism is okay? 
t1_duymov1	0	*	Hopefully. We might not even make it to then. Smoke em if you got em boys! 
t1_duz3ay2	0	*	So you agree there is tons of fake news being spread but you just ignore it and claim no evidence when it reinforces your opinions.
t1_duyrygk	1	*	Reading the back and forth between you and your butt buddy here is like watching 2 dudes do the Dutch rudder...
t1_duylmiw	0	*	GOP is considerably more scummy. 
t1_duytnpg	0	*	Yeah I seriously hate all the extra money I'm getting this year. Really sucks seeing tangible change when we were getting used to simply hoping for it.  Any tangible negative changes you have noticed?
t1_duyzmu1	1	*	Thats what I linked to to show this wasnt new. 
t1_duz90ns	1	*	Dont bother. Hes either a troll or an idiot. Im just glad Im not the crazy one. 
t1_dv2i2k9	0	*	Sure theres a team working on it, but you seriously expect this to be done in a year? Didnt it take two years for Watergate? How many investigations have you run again?
t1_duyogxh	0	*	> This started from a fake dossier and lies.  Is what I was talking about.
t1_duz06cp	1	*	Meh. It's more of a bluff call type situation. 
t1_dv13ea5	1	*	I theorized that the Secret Service trained him in simple defense maneuvering.   Trump fears stairs.
t1_duym9rr	0	*	Sorry bro, I bet the kool-aid is delicious, but I think you've had enough.
t1_duyy9g8	1	*	Haha.  I'll take, 'Links That Stay Blue' for $400, Alex.
t1_duz56vo	0	*	No, I'm not implying anything. I'm just trying to finish my day job here and I still have 100 more Reddit comments to make before I can clock out at ShareBlue HQ.
t1_duyor85	1	*	Lol :))
t1_duz57op	0	*	> terminated  What's a synonym for terminated?  Fired.
t1_duzw6qk	1	*	Saving a ton of lives from AIDs these days
t1_duyyo65	0	*	I dont know what the third is but if i recall right #1 and #2 are nothing new. I still dont get what this has todo with Trump.  Your edit:  what is telling? 
t1_dv2fg1n	1	*	There will always be someone to argue an opposite side, so the existence of this argument doesn't mean anything.
t1_duytwaj	0	*	You might want to loosen up your tin foil hat. I think it's affecting blood flow to your noggin. 
t1_duyvo8j	0	*	Are you a part of the investigation or do you have national security clearance? How do you know that there is no credible allegation of wrongdoing?  
t1_duzp6ss	0	*	Amazing.  Everything you just said is wrong.
t1_duyn3je	1	*	So many baseless assumptions. No wonder you don't want a response. Enjoy your echo chamber, surely this time Trumps going down.
t1_dv3f5n3	0	*	Ignoring us? Your comments may be getting removed but we still want to see you sources.
t1_duym5x9	0	*	It's pretty obvious your knowledge of this is massively lacking. 
t1_duymuqx	0	*	You don't consider getting a clear majority of votes a fair and open democratic process?
t1_duymu66	0	*	Thats exactly the same amount of help that Hillary got from illegal Californian immigrants. 
t1_duynkuh	0	*	I was told not believe anonymous sources from the fake news media. I'm afraid I am going to need to see certified tax returns. 
t1_duyp2d2	0	*	OP asked about your claimed billions of dollars. The source doesnt say billions of dollars. It is a lot what he has but not the claimed billions of dollars
t1_duyt7ht	1	*	J Cole :p
t1_duz1mg5	0	*	Does it even matter at this point? A goat with a brain infection would do less damage to our country.
t1_duyr6s5	1	*	Can you imagine the headlines if a president crashed their car with a little booze in their system? 
t1_dv04lmb	0	*	If you accept a fact checking website as gospel then you're a fool. Do your own work and stop taking short cuts. 
t1_duykpbx	1	*	So your answer is yes, you are going to ignore that part. 
t1_dv0vv5i	0	*	Sorry bud, didn't vote for Obama and I don't believe in God
t1_duz9efd	0	*	I didn't crawl through his post history. I was just going off the basis of his single comment. I should comment stalk people better I suppose.
t1_dv1ekcn	0	*	not really
t1_duyvoiv	0	*	why are you still here then?
t1_duyrhl6	1	*	And now you're ignoring the bulk of what I said.  Could you at least attempt a fully formed and reasoned argument? I'm starting to get bored.
t1_duyqo8e	1	*	So you won't respond to my questions, you won't accept what you are, but you'll claim victory and then insult me... You're so special 
t1_dszdtc9	1	*	Good to hear, Ive been waiting on starting that show for some reason.
t1_dsydnhk	1	*	I'm sorry!
t1_dsyhgam	0	*	This reads like propaganda.

t1_dsyihih	1	*	> Gee wiz willickers golly oh boy
t1_dsye87i	0	*	Have you seen the movie? The kid was mistaken for Juice. The head of the bank was in on mob dealings. It wasn't about the check. I dont believe the money wasn't in any real account.
t1_dszwsi2	1	*	Lol, fair enough.
t1_dsygv85	0	*	or just filled with hair or some shit
t1_dsyue1y	1	*	Well 960 shits, but yeah.

t1_dt1m5ff	1	*	I didn't say all for DACA, I said majority, which the polling supports.  As for the wall, fine, saying nobody is wrong, but the majority do not want it, which the polling also supports.
t1_dt1kfq8	0	*	No I'm just being real, you wouldnt know about that 
t1_dtpxqld	1	*	It's not your fault...
t1_ds6llo7	1	*	Good point
t1_ds6328d	1	*	Thank you, you said what I what I wanted for me.
t1_ds6bszj	1	*	Yeah, I didn't notice. In fact it is all peace and quite in the middle east. Roses and beautiful beautiful gardens. Only those smelly Jews are ruining it for everyone. 
t1_ds62kns	0	*	Actually, Jews should be able to live anywhere they want. How would you like if you were told your religion could only live in North Dakota and no where else?
t1_ds6mu3l	0	*	Dear god, you're bloody fucking illiterate!
t1_ds61avv	0	*	Most Israeli Jews aren't of European decent. How about that?  Also, Jews kinda left Europe after Europe tried to exterminate them and nobody gave two shits a little bit after.
t1_ds61dwa	0	*	I took for granted you were an American occuper, there's so many of them on Reddit.
t1_ds63azi	1	*	He doesn't have any, because he's full of shit. 
t1_dtxasrl	0	*	Thanks for taking the time to explain that, really appreciate it! Really interesting 
t1_dtxaq72	0	*	Apparently one of his daughters took a vehicle from his election campaign and drove it round the streets with a magaphone shouting for people not to vote for him.
t1_du0eag6	0	*	Oh I had a point? lol
t1_dtxdqoy	0	*	It's a shitty thing to do. Gay people should've had equal rights all along. 
t1_dtxl2pk	1	*	Dawwww, don't worry I'm sure your gay enough!
t1_dujcmn2	1	*	I havent noticed any of those things from Palestine. No one in the mid east has worked harder to avoid peace than them. Talk about misconstrue? Your nailing it.  
t1_du99v7z	1	*	And yet solar energy costs are down!
t1_du9fluq	0	*	Since when does Israel recognize Hamas (who govern gaza along with being terrorists and gaza is still dependent on Israel) as anything other than a terrorist organization?
t1_dujlkz0	1	*	Uh huh.
t1_du8v4nu	0	*	A. There was no Palestinian army to start a war.  B. The Israeli's started it.   They call it a pre-emptive strike, but a build up of forces is not an act of war, just an act of diplomacy. 
t1_duabpim	1	*	Try and dock a ship in the Gaza Strip. 
t1_dua3rd4	1	*	I think that the West Bank is an entirely different animal. At the very least, I'd like to see a settlement freeze.
t1_du8pl5k	1	*	Check again.
t1_du8rg4f	1	*	Israel doesn't claim that as their border, what kibbutz did you hear that bullshit on? 
t1_du8ow3x	0	*	Have you lost sympathy for all Americans, the French, Burundians, Russians? Their governments have also committed grave human rights abuses, violations and atrocities and by definition are terrorists.
t1_du99uol	1	*	I think its more a mindset like the one currently gripping police in the US
t1_duhykxo	0	*	Clearly you don't know shit about fuck.
t1_dui9dsx	1	*	I don't know if it did or didnt, but that is why I was talking in past tense. 
t1_dui35a3	0	*	Exactly, and it isnt going away anytime soon so welcome to reality
t1_dukh00w	1	*	Point, but that still puts them 2.5 times above most other profit margins, and up to 8 times other industries as well.

t1_dv4v9ct	0	*	Axa0familyxa0walks into the White House wanting to perform their act...

t1_dv73qop	0	*	Kinda does.
t1_dv57x2c	1	*	Reddit is designed to be a news aggregator first. Im not saying discussion doesnt happen. Im saying its not the primary function.
t1_dv6h8m3	1	*	Not many are!
t1_dv6d8gz	0	*	I donxb4t even understand what youxb4re trying to say. Ixb4m not a democrat and Ixb4m not a republican, Ixb4m not even from America. I donxb4t even own a gun lmao

t1_dv5txxu	1	*	Asatru or faith in the gods is growing across the world. People are leaving Christianity to return to the religions of their ancestors. Odin IS awesome.
t1_dv56vih	0	*	Corporations are people, my friend.  Crazy that a presidential candidate actually fucking said that. 
t1_dv51r86	0	*	How do we know they have? We can't say either way can we?    So, that pretty much just makes this noise without any real meaning. 
t1_dv5w9x6	0	*	You didnt answer my question :)
t1_dv55ae3	0	*	You can't appeal plea bargains. That's part of the bargain. Try again Ivan. 
t1_dv571x4	0	*	Lol, why is it always YouTube links with you guys?  Nunes is a [liar](https://www.vox.com/world/2018/2/24/17048936/democrat-rebuttal-nunes-schiff-memo)
t1_dv5d2qr	1	*	No that's just math. 
t1_dv5kiqj	1	*	Even if I were to grant your argument, just because the other options are bad doesnt make a third bad option any good. 
t1_dv5ggno	1	*	I was, resigned due to injuries and moved out of state.
t1_dv5lvd3	1	*	That last sentence is unequivocally false and laughably so. How can you even say that with a straight face?
t1_dv53nf9	0	*	Which is exactly what i said?  Im not sure why you just repeated what i just said??
t1_dv503nx	0	*	How's the weather in St. Petersburg?
t1_dv4vysx	1	*	Oh ok! Maybe they could make a Kushner Quack video game too!
t1_dv5q4mu	1	*	Not sure how you meant us to take this, but I think the answer is a little of both.
t1_dv653qt	0	*	How did that prove your point?   You seem to be a bit retarded but I wont blame you for it, its not your fault that Americas education system is one of the worst in the western world.
t1_dv4vtjk	1	*	Please include me in the peer review as an observer.
t1_duv6u8h	1	*	Most likely he just starts losing allies and at some point dies from sudden heart attack when his bodyguards took day off.  That's our tradition so to speak
t1_duv6nqf	0	*	Oh, of course, there is simply no way out for him. That's the disadvantage of being ruthless dictator.
t1_du18ouy	0	*	Yes because a few idiots represent 17.5 million people. So all muslims are terrorists then?
t1_dtzk3i3	1	*	Because your argument is still wrong? Like, why does this need to be explained to you?  You can find a source to an opinion piece saying the sky is green, but it's still blue.
t1_dtzjafg	0	*	Or to say theres no way to tell....  do you have learning difficulties?
t1_dtzlw5h	0	*	> Yes I've been proven wrong and yes my political movement is staffed by murderers and racists but if I may deflect for a moment I *really* don't like how someone just called me on my nonsense.
t1_dtzlyl1	0	*	exaclty, so i think it's you who didn't know what a dam is  or did you think you can only have a dam on a river?
t1_dtzvgmp	0	*	I'd prefer to work to outperform China rather than imitate them.
t1_dsfdfob	0	*	Ok, which of those are 'right'? What makes them right?  I'm amazed you recalled articles you read from almost 3 years ago :D
t1_dsflxi6	0	*	Tax cuts, deregulation, stock market, lowest unemployment for Hispanics and blacks in decades.  Yes he is fighting for the average man who wants to work his ass off.
t1_dsfdcuc	0	*	I think you're confused. MidnightLiving claimed that Breitbart is very far right. I argued that he's never read a single article.
t1_dsfdzzv	1	*	What? How so, explain in detail how me pointing out the absurdity of a mental illness fueled pedo smear is to blame for hollywood abuse scandals.  Let's see the gymnastics.

t1_dsfo399	0	*	eh, I'm just not interested in working to educate some internet stranger when they could easily click two links and see for themselves. 
t1_dsfdtrs	0	*	Thank god for warriors like you. 
t1_dsq7h63	0	*	The CSA was not allowed to become a separate nation, that was the point of that war.   The two Koreas had already become separate nations for years before the war. 
t1_dspuha3	1	*	Yeah, it's not like North Korea had the power to deal with the first two carrier groups anyway. Three is a little ridiculous.
t1_dsq7cv6	0	*	Interesting. So whatever America does is ok because china BAD.  Why didn't you just say that from the start lol.
t1_dv46y7l	1	*	Let's hope so

t1_dtgs7zw	1	*	She's not religious though, just against silly names.
t1_dtfzeam	0	*	I didn't read his comment as antagonistic towards yours more of a stoic admission that things aren't ideal.
t1_dtg12uf	1	*	Well I'd say we've gotten pretty good at it. Everyone starts out sucking at running. You just gotta keep at it. 
t1_dtfde94	0	*	The DNC does deserve some of the blame and I also think Bernie would have won.   Let's just save the directly responsible tag for the GOP, entertainment news and the folks that voted for him.

t1_dtfm64m	0	*	You either didn't actually vote or were a young prodigy at voter fraud.
t1_dtguyc2	1	*	Thanks for your reply. It's one of the more interesting thoughts on democracy I've read even though I assumed I would disagree with you
t1_dtfl6pd	0	*	That's a reddit in-joke, amirite?
t1_dtf6mbs	1	*	Oh now I get it. O-1 - individuals with an extraordinary ability in the sciences, education, business, or athletics   The guy that helped to spit Europe apart certainly qualifies.
t1_dtld2ew	1	*	No there's more, but is it really worth it?
t1_dsfw0fn	1	*	I have 100 faith they are going to do whats best for them and their donors at the expense of everyone else. They are the bad cop, Democrats are good cop.
t1_ds38r0x	0	*	Right, none of them. No banks, no ATMs will give you a rate of 10-1. How many times does it have to be repeated?
t1_ds2vx9f	1	*	Conservatives are dinosaurs still alive after the meteor has hit. They just don't know it.
t1_ds2vx1t	0	*	Of course, and venezuela is not socialism.
t1_ds36on3	1	*	There are no free markets in Europe. A highly regulated and interventionist market is not free market capitalism. 
t1_dtbokqe	0	*	Last time I'm talking this circle. Yes, that's be the ideal endgame in all U.S. domination in Asia.
t1_dtcr3ad	1	*	> It's going to happen unless you want to indefinitely occupy the country  Well... There it is.
t1_dugk9nn	0	*	I'm confident the reason the Germans that you know insult you is nothing to do with global politics. 
t1_dugi1uw	0	*	well I just read the article and I really dont get what the fuzz is about its just like you are all channeling your inner SJW's. or in other words being outraged over nothing
t1_duhe5yd	0	*	Aside from it being on the security council? It hosts the single most powerful and influential monarch in the world.
t1_dugoexx	1	*	>I could believe that cooperation means a joint US-Germany Olympic Team. Who says I'm wrong, based on your standards?  Not my standards. It's with respect to the context laid out in OP's article. 
t1_dugrz52	1	*	I just did. 
t1_dujpqqw	1	*	That made me chuckle.
t1_dujq4wc	1	*	And I for one have no problem with us doing it.
t1_dtrcwcx	1	*	In his defense, it was craft beers. They're usually between 6-8%. In my defense I didn't mean every night, just when you drink. 
t1_dtr7sfp	1	*	I notice after one Saturday night of cutting back. 
t1_ds8y3gu	0	*	No, building settlements is none of those things. It's just building settlements, on land agreed by both sides to be their administrator.
t1_dsahf4k	1	*	Yeah...I'm just going to consider this convo a done dead deal. I don't work with fantasy and rainbows and happy imaginations.
t1_dsp503h	0	*	It's not Chinese, but[ Brahmos-II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BrahMos-II) is going to be hypersonic. Current versions already go mach 3 which is pretty damn fast.
t1_dsowta7	0	*	This was the immediate aftermath of WW2; everyone wanted to contain the conflict, maybe save MacArthur.
t1_dsp3o2j	0	*	I would say the bigger threat would be meteors bigger than texas
t1_dsp4hq6	0	*	Then why list a range. The numbers don't add up to real physics. It's like every other Russian tech, they claim one thing and then you find out it's a rusting pile of shit. 
t1_dsp89pe	0	*	Tribalism is a neurobiological given, even if there may be flexibility in its expression.
t1_dsp91mm	1	*	How do you figure? Weather varies more than that year-to-year. Crop yields might not be as good, but that's nowhere near enough to cause widespread crop failures.
t1_dsp476m	1	*	When is the last time a US carrier group has gotten anywhere near Russia?

t1_dsp2dts	0	*	To completely blow apart the earth (gravitational binding energy ~ 10^32 J) would take approximately 10^17 megatons. To make earth completely uninhabitable would be many orders of magnitude lower.

t1_dspc9i5	1	*	The conventional mermaid does have a mouth, you know.
t1_dsp1p7l	0	*	Good luck targeting a missile with sonar. A submarine has to stay hidden against the escort ships. A satellite is only onsite for a minute or two assuming it even flies over the fleet.
t1_dsp34a1	1	*	China was still largely stuck in the 19th century technology-wise during the Korean War.
t1_dsot6aw	0	*	Dinosaurs survived for far longer than we did. So, maybe we would survive, but probably we wouldn't. And the next species would come along. 
t1_dsoya7p	1	*	Wasnt it about the Gauss technology or something? 
t1_dsoygr4	1	*	A little bit of both...
t1_dspeowa	1	*	What is your source for that? From what I can tell, there is no actual consensus as to what caused the apocalypse, other than it was probably nuclear.
t1_dsp4ohq	0	*	Do you not know what fallout is?
t1_dspgpc1	1	*	No. It's left intentionally undisclosed as to what caused the apocalyptic events in The Road.
t1_dsoyrx0	1	*	I think they are referring to the [WU-14](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WU-14), which is rumored to be compatible with the [DF-26](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DF-26) platform.

t1_dspd11k	1	*	I get you though but the point is that things don't happen as it should. If it did we wouldn't have so many world problems.
t1_dsp72is	0	*	to be fair, ain't it kind of fucked up that there are two MADs when talking about geopolitical military stuff?
t1_dsov76y	0	*	More so than the scientific shortcomings of other movies?
t1_dsp7y8c	1	*	And concrete. Up until quite recently. It was rediscovered around 1850 and it was into the 1900's before it was put to large scale infrastructure use.
t1_dspynh7	1	*	If you can believe it, this happens more often by accident than by intention.  Submarines, even while stalking a target, would never want to get surrounded by a carrier group.
t1_dspioy4	1	*	In the movie, there is actually a mention of the Bland Corporation.
t1_dspkfof	1	*	Then don't bother posting. Only licensed armchair generals are allowed 
t1_dsp9cdt	1	*	ww3 would be total war, the vietnam war wasnt
t1_dspl4sr	1	*	No, you need to look at a map, Vladivostok is in the sea of Japan.
t1_dspaqoz	0	*	Nah. Do you have any idea how many weapons were tested? Nukes are scary af, for sure, but earth is really really big. 
t1_dsp1lwx	0	*	You might have been thinking of the Richter scale for earthquakes, which grows exponentially.
t1_dspfby8	1	*	Violently stupid really is the best way to describe that kind of lunacy.
t1_dsp7exj	0	*	You propose doing nothing. You propose silence. Allow them to be corrupt, allow them to destroy government from within, destroy the public service. Gerrymander and lie.   You're the problem.

t1_dsp5p1q	1	*	Forgot or couldn't afford?
t1_dsp9lli	0	*	Proof that the timeline we're in has diverged and combined with the alternate Strangelove universe. Which explains why Things are Stranger these days...
t1_dsp6983	1	*	MAD is useless if the enemy doesnt know about it.
t1_dsp8l58	1	*	You don't even need H-Bombs. 100 Hiroshima sized  bombs would put up enough ash if they hit cities. Turns out the latest studies show people way underestimated.
t1_dsp8d9w	1	*	*that we know of
t1_dspik6d	1	*	More like mach 6, and at ground level that it's designed to operate I'd imagine it would be way slower, like mach 2 to mach 3. 
t1_dspe7a1	0	*	I've read more about this weapon, and [they've certainly considered using it against NYC](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8e/Statoud.gif).
t1_dspdz6a	0	*	well the sahara is not THAT  densly populated...  im on a list now, arnt I?
t1_dspfyvw	1	*	South Koreans must be cultured AF to make a 40 million dollar subtitled film. 
t1_dsp1zim	1	*	Depends on the scale of it, really. Humans surviving is a strong possibility, but not a guarantee. *Some* life surviving, however, is more or less guaranteed. So at least there's that. 
t1_dsp4xc4	0	*	Huh? Can you expand on that please 
t1_dsp1xc2	0	*	Why? It's a pretty good movie 
t1_dspehry	1	*	Exactly what I was thinking of, too.
t1_dsoyamy	1	*	They didn't become a legitimate power until October 16th 1964.
t1_dspuzse	1	*	That was a very good read, thank you. Maybe just dispersing over just Greenland and the Artic, protect what needs to be protected, gather much needed data and reduce the the risk to plants globally.
t1_dsp8pdy	1	*	i think SU-57 is not even operational yet.
t1_dspfrg6	0	*	Tech might have advanced, but society is pretty stagnant and shitty. What was true 50 , 100, 1000 years ago, it's still true today, when it's About humans.
t1_dsq9x07	0	*	I admit I'm not knowledgeable enough on this subject for this debate.  The USA did fancy fucked up shit and Stalin was just simple murder.  
t1_dsoy3my	0	*	Not him but the USA wasn't mobilised to near the degree it was during ww2. The stakes weren't high enough to justify it
t1_dsp50vw	1	*	Everyone of their subs is tracked and accounted for. 
t1_dsp189r	1	*	China didn't complete their first nuclear weapon test until more than 10 years after the Korean armistice.
t1_dsp10a8	1	*	Mankind drank water carried through lead pipes for 2000 years.
t1_dsp85qd	1	*	I remember that link.  But the distance of the shockwave was amazing so I tried to map it using the other link.

t1_dsrqo2a	0	*	A stopped clock is right twice a day
t1_dsrnmxj	0	*	Is there a front page that doesn't require me to log out to see? As it stands the front page is just the sub-reddits I subscribe to.
t1_dsrvycr	0	*	That wasn't a question
t1_dsrucfa	0	*	How about you read a bit more and look at how they differ. Then report what back to me what youve learned. 
t1_dsrwbup	0	*	Can't go one hot minute without invoking the left can ya?  You can tell Trump is a difficult person to defend when literally every defense of him is but waddabout
t1_dssp5rc	0	*	In what way did it give them credibility?
t1_dsrvt1j	1	*	Generally, when paratroopers are dropping there will be a *lot* of people parachuting to the ground. If there's only a few people parachuting, chances are they bailed out of a plane.
t1_dssazeg	0	*	Oh yeah he did. Great reading comprehension by me. 
t1_dstib7k	0	*	It's called a news story, you have to read the article to understand what's going on. I know there's no headline to tell you how to feel, but you have to try really hard to put those letters together 
t1_dsrsqws	0	*	I was under the impression that sociopath is a discredited, obsolete term no longer used by mental health professionals, and hasn't been for quite some time (several decades).  Is this not the case?
t1_dsrs9oc	1	*	Oh so you got nothing. Got it!
t1_dsroi1q	1	*	Id say that it is a lot, especially compared with other first world countries.  Half of the worlds prison population is in America.  Thats a problem.
t1_dsro9nm	0	*	So he's no worse than Churchill
t1_dsrt3ai	1	*	It's called trimming the fat.

t1_dsse2xq	0	*	If only someone had tweeted a penis insult at them, that may never have happened.
t1_dsrtg7o	0	*	The border wall and Muslim bans are hardly mainstream, that's why there's basically no congressional support for the wall and he's trying to use EO's for the ban
t1_dss51pd	0	*	You don't have to pretend it's a docile butterfly, how tf do they handle hornet nests where you're from? 
t1_dsrtmqr	1	*	I'm not arguing the sociopath part, just the perfectly defensible conservative policy part
t1_dss6f85	0	*	Then you should know that some small country across the ocean that has always been all bark and no bite should be the least of your worries.

t1_dsy5e6u	1	*	3 days later, no response 
t1_dsro4uf	0	*	It seems like you're having trouble comprehending, let me help you. Koreans don't like Americans and their rapey Japanese friends. 
t1_dsrsndc	0	*	You used so many words and said absolutely nothing.  Having a playground argument is just asking to antagonise people. Waving your cock around because you think you're untouchable is an idiots game.
t1_dst9b7b	0	*	Low effort troll. 
t1_dsrqh8g	1	*	Never said anything about the effectiveness of it. Bold strategy pays off, at least for now
t1_dsrorep	0	*	Koreans are a nation from the Korean peninsula and they can threaten anybody they want in their country, just because Americans invaded it doesn't mean dogshit
t1_dsrozjs	0	*	Absolutely, Im not questioning that it is bad.  However, we can also find testimony of people with similar experiences in America.
t1_dss05fm	1	*	What else should be do to convince the murderous dictator that the US is harmless and cowering?  I say to do that we should reelect Obama! What do you think?
t1_dsrw3cp	0	*	Please tell me who wouldn't celebrate it?

t1_dsl6t3f	0	*	>  The Trump Dossier, which Comey admitted is unverified, was used in the FISA applications.  Do you have any source for that besides Trump's twitter or far right blogs?
t1_dsl2s3m	0	*	I'm sure they do. Him and Kim are pretty much the only ones wanting to see a nuke go off.  Edit: He's right...

t1_dsl04bz	0	*	 first some sources for your claims
t1_dsl6vwt	0	*	Standard of living is certainly a part of what most people value, but the ultimate decision of what a person decides as their success is left to themselves. 
t1_dslj9a4	1	*	Oh so you just go around and tell people they are insane and wrong despite having no evidence to support your claim. You need help. 
t1_dslidg4	0	*	How exactly am I on edge?... Because I tell people they are deluded and need help when asked about economy numbers?
t1_dsl2sy6	0	*	So sad dude. You sidestep so hard. Dude asked a simple question, you respond with your own without answering, it's asinine. Go back to t_d
t1_dslbj3c	0	*	Why?

t1_dslbni3	0	*	You are correct you are a Grammar Nazi and nobody likes you but you are right.
t1_dslc89r	0	*	Fair enough. Are you going to debate my primary point? That he literally made no mention of race? 
t1_dslbb6z	0	*	That's not really an argument. Also, I wouldn't see that as something positive in a larger perspective. It essentially means peace in the world would negatively impact the US economy.
t1_dsn4pjv	0	*	Alright lad, keep pretending just 'cause trump said some encouraging stuff it means economic policy was different
t1_dsl2vb8	0	*	Are you trying to blot out the last few months?

t1_dsl5asq	1	*	No. The procedure for launching nuclear weapons doesn't allow for this. From the secretary of defense on down their options are to put it in motion or resign.

t1_dsl76vo	0	*	Billy Joel and Elton John aren't TOO bad... But yes, initial caution is warranted.
t1_dsl2st8	0	*	Your comment wasn't reasonable, it was quite stupid. So was your follow up. Wanna go for 3/3?  BTW, you might want to read more about his tax plan if you actually think it's good for you.

t1_dslkgpt	1	*	Yes.
t1_dsl0631	1	*	You already explained it, in that comment. 
t1_dslkd3n	1	*	And the Opioid crisis can be laid squarely at the feet of big Pharma and yes our leadership let them get away with it
t1_ds9k71a	0	*	It is true if someone makes it a priority. There are countless scholarships, grants housing arrangements, etc., that someone that makes it a priority can do it. Nobody owes you shit otherwise. 
t1_ds9jrd2	0	*	Luck? I worked the entire time I was in college. Gave up nights and weekends for 5 years. Luck had very little to do with it. 
t1_ds9m3bl	0	*	 How long can this go on?

t1_dsbvtcn	0	*	Oh give it up. You are on the wrong side of the issue.
t1_dsbx8fn	1	*	I absolutely understand.   I'm a slave to my coffee machine. Those bastards from Keurig have me under their thumb.
t1_dsaby1w	1	*	Yeah but this way the employees don't get free food.
t1_dsb6fhf	1	*	Part of the point of consultants is that you don't have to listen to them if the politics don't work in your favor. 
t1_ds9jna2	0	*	But everyone doesn't do what I did. So it's a moot question. 
t1_dsb2lbu	1	*	Ah the STEM people. Funny that you mention - waste management is a direct issue many industrial ENGINEERS face in their careers. 
t1_ds9jo7m	0	*	Because People really enjoy working and running fast food restaurants like Tim Hortons 
t1_ds9xkz5	0	*	You think those consultants or internal employees always make the right decision? How cute. You have no grasp of the retarded decisions that can be made due to internal company politics. 
t1_ds9z9yl	1	*	They are fixing it with a tech solution though...
t1_dtuy657	0	*	The way Ive seen it on Facebook/Insta/etc...that doesnt even exist 
t1_dtv96zn	1	*	When that happens there's likely something a bit more serious going on than a torn ankle.  Anyways the USA has the same problem but worse, so what's your point?
t1_dtvcynp	0	*	Hey guys look at this mr rich pants. He wants a world where richer people get a higher priority rather than people who legit might die, solely because richer people have more money
t1_dsosjnt	0	*	Yeah because clearly my stance is accept everyone without questions and immediately 
t1_du041u9	1	*	I wasn't sure and didn't want to jump to conclusions but it kinda came off that way when I read it...
t1_du0pq56	0	*	I don't think that means what you think it means lol. 
t1_du65dts	1	*	You're calling someone else a notorious liar and accusing people of having multiple accounts considering the posts you've made as your alter ego /u/SlaineBro28? You're kidding right?
t1_dstnsq0	0	*	 I guess I don't have a rebuttal. Heyoooo

t1_dsmbax3	1	*	Then place and ice cube on the salt
t1_dsmh1av	0	*	Maybe it's the wording of the question, but I don't understand. Raise eggs? You mean raise chickens that produce eggs? 
t1_dsmcxzq	1	*	brah...
t1_dsms403	1	*	Because your suggestion of poor people living on beans and rice, in a fucking first world country, shows how out of touch the US is with it's people.

t1_dsmgcz6	0	*	those are already cut
t1_dsls3eq	0	*	It should be illegal, actually 
t1_dsm9nnc	0	*	I thought they boiled it alive because that's how they wait until the last second to cook it. That way the meat is as fresh as possible before being cooked and served. 
t1_dsme0pw	0	*	No it's not because you somehow place a human's life above all else. You also have some weird notion that prison = cruel and inhumane abuse.
t1_dsmbajz	0	*	Stop being stupid, you clearly have no idea what you are talking about.  They 100% feel distress and communicate it to other plants.
t1_dsmfn8r	0	*	Pretty sure they died fast tho as any time I kill a bug I instinctively do so with 500,000 times the mount of force that would be required to kill it.
t1_dsmc24o	0	*	What if it was a really charming pig.
t1_dsmdct9	1	*	:)  Btw, Asian food and pizza would have been cheaper as well.   Mexican food is still a rather new thing in Switzerland
t1_dsn515i	1	*	Ah, I see. Good point if they go with the stunning method.  For me, it's the moral option because it prevents unnecessary pain.
t1_dsmaao4	1	*	Lobsters may be mammals elsewhere..  But your weak link is  this is Earth. 
t1_dsm5ykr	1	*	You wouldn't think it be that way, but it do
t1_dsmd9iy	1	*	r/vegan in a nutshell 
t1_dsmce5p	1	*	No. Some sacrifices must still be made to preserve our quality of life. The boils must proceed.
t1_dsmagqa	0	*	By that measure, fruit flies are better than lobster. 
t1_dsmbeck	1	*	If you put them in the freezer to sedate them first, it might still be okay. They won't feel any pain.
t1_dsniexn	1	*	Most of that is tied up in sense of smell.  Dogs were bred to track people.  Cats were bred to be more *cat*.  They were unnaturally selected for apathy.
t1_ds9a1ph	1	*	Pretty much all of them, tbh.
t1_dup7uau	0	*	So you are calling me a fascist and think that the things I said are wrong... without justifying those things? Great.
t1_dupq37r	0	*	There it is! That's why people don't want you violent idiots punching Nazis. Because everyone to the right of center is a Nazi in your eyes.    
t1_duqhq3g	1	*	Because fascism can be voted in. 
t1_dup35t6	0	*	>Vigilante violence against someone who is a political opponent is a definitively fascist action.  So the 60-70 assassination attempts on Hitler's life were just fascist attacks?
t1_dupfomx	0	*	A three way front with the United States and Russia knocking on Hitler's door. While the coward chewed on cyanide.  Fascists are violent cowards.
t1_dup2mqh	1	*	we'll call that you remembering the word cognitive dissonance
t1_duqmc36	0	*	So are you willing to pin deaths due to poor healthcare coverage to capitalism? Homelessness? Heart disease? Pollution? Comparisons to Hitler, well done moron. 
t1_duq0dn8	0	*	Lmfao the Americans who knocked Hitler back were proud nationalists, the exact opposite of what antifa is.

t1_duppwtb	0	*	You're a low level troll, man. Your name checks out.
t1_dupco2k	0	*	how is stating that antifa may include groups of people who are willing to use violence to obtain their political goals being apologetic of the far right? 
t1_dupbx8b	1	*	As many times as people spam the same right wing apologetic nonsense.
t1_dupodvp	1	*	it's called an ad hominem attack, he cant defend his position so he'll just give you shit instead - im sure he will have a wonderful life /s.

t1_dtz9sro	0	*	All your points are valid, yet still, he showed what he was, how he would do things, and he didn't change a bit once in office. You have to acknowledge that.

t1_dtl7dra	1	*	Just so it's said, I think Ustiugov should compete.
t1_dtksjtb	0	*	Do you have any info on these markers? I can't find anything while Googling, just comes up with current tests and natural markers they use in testing.

t1_dupqzy3	0	*	So clever, you're a perfect representation of your people...
t1_duqgk65	0	*	What governments? There was no technology of any kind. No writing of any kind. You need to take a dispassionate look at this stuff. Human history is pretty interesting stuff.
t1_duqusji	1	*	I didn't mean that the event was caused by insubordination just that how the soldiers acted couldn't be controlled by anyone. 
t1_duq81gh	0	*	Why would that matter? Its behaviors that are the issue, regardless of geographic location or skin color, obviously.
t1_dsehu8r	1	*	> People like you are the reason we can't destroy a pathetic little insurgency in decades.  So how did carpet bombing help destroy the insurgency in Vietnam? 
t1_dsduxx1	1	*	Do yo know what the Vietnam War was? We dropped more bombs on them than in the entirety of World War 2, we killed 1/3 of their population and they still won. Obvious troll is obvious 
t1_dsdwk42	1	*	>We are different, we have superior firepower.  Oh yes? So by that statement, absolutely no difference. Every bit, the callous attitude of every other terrorist.
t1_dtttmh1	0	*	Do you have a list that would exist if you werent a lying sack of shit or dont you?  One list of nations conquered by imperialist NATO. Put up or shut up.
t1_dt06tmm	0	*	> Suicide Attacks are not nessesarily terror attacks  lol i love reddit sometimes 
t1_dszwa0e	0	*	In the end, the Treaty of Sevres reduced them to their ancestral Ottoman territories, prior to the rise of the Empire. Seems fair to me. 
t1_dume925	1	*	My teams and your teams are identical, except the piles of cash given to Saddam was nowhere near the amount of money involved in Iran-Contra.

t1_dumb2az	0	*	Uhhhh.... Most people aren't Christian.
t1_dum9tfv	0	*	You act like this is a bad thing.
t1_dumi8uv	1	*	You don't actually have a point. By which I mean this was a waste of time - you should've replied to the guy you're actually criticising.   Assuming of course that you didn't already.
t1_dum6uwf	0	*	The U.S. gave Iraq info gathered from satellite intelligence on Iranian troop movement.   With the knowledge those guys could have been gassed.
t1_dun1cyn	0	*	[Why do people believe in conspiracy theories?](https://youtu.be/X4POCqi-1jM)

t1_dulwxdp	1	*	Sounds like something a T-1000 would ask....
t1_dulsupi	0	*	They do kill thousands and many go unreported. Bombing villages and so on. Its brutal and they need to mind their own fucking business
t1_dumam81	0	*	Mate you sound like a left wing crazy. Obama said he doesn't know why he got it  It's cause you're a racist who doesn't get civil rights   Seriously dude, chill. 
t1_dulntpo	1	*	Un was slighted on an international stage. Russia and China use this tactic all the time. It is a diplomatic technique. All diplomacy isn't in good faith. 
t1_dum5rgm	0	*	Except for one problem... Portugal's solution requires a broad (very expensive) safety net.  You're applying developed-world solutions to developing-world countries.
t1_dum2cza	0	*	> And the empire was what?  An evil multinational/international political structure. 
t1_dulnq15	1	*	Oil
t1_dulnt0o	0	*	SA is shit, but you're trying to posit them as committing worse crimes than NK? What's your endgame here? Do you want us to kiss NK's ass to bring them to the table, or what? 
t1_dumlw74	0	*	If you take that as an insult Jesus that's like the Trumpers sucking each other's dicks if you mention the wall will never be built.  Grow the fuck up.
t1_dum2lgg	1	*	Yes. The US mishandled southeast Asia (both Vietnam and Cambodia) in the worst way possible.

t1_dumlqi5	0	*	If we're just talking policies there are plenty of world leaders who contributed to their nation's prosperity without ordering a single killing. Peace prize should go to any of them first.
t1_dum0awj	1	*	You have a fundamental misunderstanding of what the president is and why he is elected the way he is. 
t1_dulvccu	1	*	Well I'm not saying Obama was the best president ever, but at least he didn't railed the whole world to make fun of him.
t1_dunoshc	0	*	My bad, but I will say it is essentially ignored
t1_dulnlmm	0	*	Oh FFS, not now. You people are leaking everywhere. Kids died.

t1_dt73l5t	0	*	Without wanting to sound like an asshole, how does PR strengthen/assist the U.S Economy? 
t1_dua5u93	0	*	Comedian Jim Jefferies made some brilliant points on gun control. Why do you need an assault rifle for self defence was one of them. 
t1_duaiwhe	1	*	Guns dont really have an actual useful purpose outside of war, and i aint talking hobbies, where as knives at least sensible ones have a use as do trucks.
t1_duayzt7	1	*	Your right. Sometimes I forget about that one because I've never actually seen it done at a gun show. 
t1_dua5d7r	0	*	Taxes are a dirty word here in the states. I don't get it. I mean, I do, corporations and politicians have been brainwashing impressionable people to hate taxes for decades, it's just stupid.
t1_dua5wxq	0	*	The point is he wont be able to get an AK in the first place
t1_duc3vy8	0	*	> If someone is ready to kill people.... obtaining a gun illegally is a trivial concern.  Maybe in the USA. In most westernised countries acquiring a gun isn't that easy.
t1_dua7tgl	0	*	Permitting is done on a state-by-state basis. Also, it is far more difficult to purchase hand guns than rifles and shot guns, so the original poster likely didnt leave with a hand gun in 10 minutes.
t1_dua8yq6	1	*	Goodnight!
t1_dua7787	0	*	Okay, great conversation. Fuck you, too.
t1_dua5wi0	0	*	Lmao sorry didnt mean to trigger you
t1_dua713k	1	*	The funny thing is that in this analogy the fire extinguisher is the cause of the fire in the first place. 
t1_dua5brm	1	*	Because the entire US system is based around survival of the fittest and fuck you If you don't have money  So they'd rather die of debt than help people in need with taxes 
t1_dua5xuv	1	*	Getting a bit provoked are we? Almost like you are taking it personally 
t1_dua6v8m	0	*	My point is... breaking gun purchase/ownership laws is nothing to someone already planning murder. 
t1_dua9c9i	0	*	No, you're clearly running away from your Yeah, you take Mexicans and South Americans comment because you know it isn't supportable.
t1_dua629s	0	*	So in essence your proposing eliminating recreational shooting and hunting as well?  The reason I ask is because the same logic you are applying to guns can also be applied to things such as alcohol 
t1_dua6206	0	*	Nah, they'd just get more armed guards. Not enough money in gun control.
t1_dua627g	0	*	Yes. Stricter gun laws doesnt mean zero guns. It just means the average unstable joe cant reach in to his drawer for his gun and decide to fire on a school
t1_duawqr1	0	*	And what about the people who help themselves with guns? What about them? Do you not consider self defense a right?  
t1_dua9wof	1	*	Ah, back to mashing the keyboard. OK, clearly you haven't got an actual point to make.
t1_dua7g2b	0	*	I dont believe so, I bought a Colt 1911 a few years back, from an older guy with a booth in Dallas, TX. No paperwork. It could of been a fluke but that isnt my understanding. 
t1_duaebqb	1	*	If you go age standardized USA is above both of em, non standardized puts them France - US - Ireland  
t1_dua6e22	1	*	These have a limited range though, so we're good problem solved!
t1_ds7v1yg	0	*	Is that not what u/TreyBTW was arguing or did I misunderstand your guys' debate here?  Also I'd like to hear your thoughts on Alex the parrot, did you have a chance to check out that link?

t1_dtc2vdl	0	*	check out the scientific studies on it. 
t1_dscefm2	0	*	Then provide a source.   Then also provide a source where that justifies the hatred of all Muslims. 
t1_dsco6ty	0	*	Wait theres a notion that New Zealanders are racist? Ive never heard that. But to be fair we dont hear much about New Zealand here in the south. Haha

t1_dscmivq	0	*	I feel like what you're hinting at is only pedophiles would be interested in this sort of thing, but clearly that's not the case considering child pageants are a thing
t1_dsc3ktj	0	*	Turkey is literally the bridge connecting the West and the East.  You could almost call it, get this: the middle.
t1_dscg3jj	0	*	So all minorities who have been systematically opressed in the states?
t1_dscf7j8	0	*	So? It's a blip, a fourth of those is already but here anymore. Half of the rest is so expected to be gone again in the next few years. And stats left doesn't make much of a different.
t1_dsca20t	0	*	There is no such thing as white and therefore no such thing as white culture.

t1_dsidxtv	1	*	How is the Quran worse than any other holy book? It's pretty standard tbh
t1_dscdz5a	0	*	I'm talking about the second and third wave migrations before Columbus was ever born. Stop assuming everything is Eurocentric.

t1_dscnzvh	1	*	Username fits. 
t1_dscbhm8	0	*	Kinda weird that you want an example buuut Skai Jackson. Shes a beauty. U0001f60b
t1_dsd8uro	0	*	I get the reference, but to be fair, freedom requires work, unless you refer to freedom to lie down and die.
t1_dsckcfs	0	*	Glad I was able to remind you of that.
t1_dsc7bk5	0	*	I completely agree with you that that is often the case, but the person I responded to is still incorrect and  can't just assume it as they have. 
t1_dsbwdkz	0	*	Probably less than you like to lie to yourself about the brutalities of your culture.
t1_dsczojr	1	*	Well I just realized cbn stands for Christian Broadcast Network so i'd take it all with a grain of saly anyways
t1_dscr1u9	0	*	Go troll somewhere else. 
t1_dscaxql	1	*	Oh right. Non-whites just have less scruples and that explains everything. Racist much?
t1_dscoteq	0	*	Not really. There's only a very narrow divide between white nationalists and neo-nazis.
t1_dscapoe	0	*	Parents/prospective parents that like to see other cute kids. 
t1_dscalqs	0	*	Do you have a source on that? Because everything i read says the exact opposite. Also The Western is not all Christians so your comment has little point
t1_dsbw3u0	1	*	You want to ban 1.2 billion people from entering your country. You are a xenophobe, by the very definition of word. Be a piece of shit if you want, but be brave enough to own up to it at the least.
t1_dsc0d1m	0	*	Maybe? We can't really know. Those who actually pride themselves with western values, don't judge people on assumptions.
t1_dschjj5	0	*	Not really... you could just add the 'n,' lazy ass.
t1_dsc6yii	0	*	And I'm sure Europe doesn't resemble the Europe our ancestors would remember. It would be arrogant and utterly ridiculous of any of us to think we can dictate the world of our descendants. 
t1_dsbwu62	0	*	sure sure.. same old same old

t1_dsbu9gg	0	*	Another idiot who doesn't understand that he is what he thinks he is fighting.
t1_dsccmgx	1	*	Agreed. It's what the native americans wanted. They didnt want to lose their cultural heritage.   Natives are given the option to go to reservation or non reservation schools. 
t1_dsdbixa	1	*	That doesn't make any sense considering that is argument is based on others knowing less about people like Muslims.
t1_dscdhc1	0	*	I think telling them that number 1 was so bad he went into the naughty cupboard and never came out, then meaningfully looking at it whenever they were misbehaving, was going a bit far... 
t1_dsco4sq	0	*	Omg ur such a bigot?!!!!!!
t1_dsccou6	1	*	Umm. I'm not blaming the native Americans. I just said the federal and state regulators couldnt keep tabs on the teachers or students because it wasn't their jurisdiction.   Wtf

t1_dsch76i	0	*	So, let me just point out this; World Wars caused by European dictators: 1. World wars caused by dictators in the islamic world: 0.
t1_dsc98vu	0	*	With the amount of people who abstained from voting, those links are useless.  Nice try though! You guys like to use misleading information to push a narrative.
t1_dscw5bi	0	*	Too Crazy; Didn't Read. Enjoy the killfile. It has a lot of alt-right racists. You should feel right at home.

t1_dscdrz3	0	*	Well it's not like they were prosperous, industrious regions before the 'imperialist powers' took over. As you said, they were actually more stable while being run by foreigners.
t1_dsbv5it	1	*	People like you would be fucked because you'd be too scared to leave your own homes or speak out loud. Apparently.  So I'm in favour. Maybe I'll convert to Sufism just to help the numbers.
t1_dsd6quj	0	*	Read about the Khmer Rouge and the killing tree. Thats a contender and it wasnt even racism. 
t1_dsbtpz1	1	*	[CITATION NEEDED]

t1_dscc0ra	0	*	All sorts of people like looking at pictures of little kids, from pre-teen girls to the elderly. It's pretty fucked up what your mind seems to be going straight to
t1_dscj4ix	0	*	Why does it matter? I'm white but if I had a kid with my girlfriend, they would be mixed. Just as much of my genes are there. So what if my future descendants have a darker skin tone? 
t1_dsby7ws	0	*	No. You are abjectly incorrect. 
t1_dscrijq	0	*	If you became a doctor and the twin became an artist, I doubt the name switch would change that. I missed that early years part though

t1_dsca90x	1	*	Yeah, but falls under the purview of is my dealer responsible and safe not is this drug safe?
t1_dsc71b5	0	*	Plenty of wealthy white people believe in the importance of welfare programs. Not everyone is as selfish as you think they are. It's not all zero sum. 
t1_duk8673	0	*	We'll see in about 50-100 years. Not that it's all his fault, but what is that old saying about if you're not part of the solution?

t1_dukd60p	0	*	He doesn't? The aim of this forest seems to be to offset the negative effects of his policies, not to harm Trump specifically.
t1_dumrn2d	0	*	Says the person who is using year old data about a completely different point and pretends it is relevant.   Is that your excuse for everything? Whining about 63 million?

t1_dukd7ts	0	*	So when someone robs you and you have to buy all new stuff, you thank the thief for getting you new things? 
t1_dukd7us	1	*	I for some reason thought it was Frank. No idea how that made sense. Maybe I've just been watching too much Punisher.
t1_dukatj6	0	*	Honestly I'd expect Australia to shift diametrically towards a total lack of poison or dangerous megafauna at all, to compensate for the rest of the world sliding into a venomous hellscape.
t1_dukcsed	0	*	You start. How clean is clean coal. What are its outputs compared to say dirty coal or nat gas?  Dont even need to define clean really. 
t1_dukbh4o	0	*	Cool.      Anything nice for dinner? I just had pizza, can't get enough of the goodfellas stonebaked thin chicken one.
t1_dukkte7	0	*	I'm so glad to hear it. I'd say the major Madison merger is with [this](https://unsettlingstories.com/what-ive-seen/), although the mushrooms are indeed tangential ;)

t1_dtgo7c5	0	*	So you have no issue with these big game hunters then? Clearly a broccoli is no different to a lion or cow.  Though I suspect you're pulling my leg.
t1_dtgsmg7	0	*	Well, if you want venison. Free range and ethical killing would be my idea just like cattle. I think they currently do this for reindeer.

t1_dtgt8n9	0	*	Bill Gates goes to Africa to be a part of conservation efforts and he manages to do it without hunting. Just because these hunters' money might go to good sources doesn't mean they are good people.
t1_dtgrwah	0	*	The people who killed the legal hunter were illegally carrying firearms. They fled the scene, as they have not been apprehended. They were not legally hunting. The hunter was. Cool?
t1_dtgsd1t	0	*	*most*
t1_dtgrrhd	1	*	You are trying to reason with someone who clearly believes that humans need to be knocked down a peg. There is no point. They are irrational.
t1_dth7kms	1	*	Yeah, your right, noone cares about animals...... /s
t1_dth0ryv	1	*	A person who knows about fallacy almost always wins the argument! U0001f44c
t1_dtgu1da	0	*	getting shot is the most humane way any wild animal will die, sure beats being eaten alive by coyotes.  
t1_dtgsgmk	0	*	Yes! I agree with hunting! However, I don't agree with all these white trash idiot hunters shooting anything and everything from the window of their truck.
t1_dtgsc14	0	*	Well tell that to all the shitty hunters with mossy oak stickers.
t1_dtgxzfu	0	*	Oh my God you are actually a caricature of yourself.     I'm sorry you take your little hobby of dress up so seriously.   
t1_dth5cak	0	*	People are shit Okay, finally you admit it. And the law is made up by people, fyi
t1_dth5fcm	0	*	If you like to kill animals for the sake of your ego, rather than the need to survive, then yes, I would think you are a bad person. 
t1_dt400ie	0	*	3 Republicans and all the Democrats voted for the shutdown.  Only a staunch Democrat looks at that vote and say the Republicans voted to shutdown.
t1_dt408tj	1	*	I thought it was a sink as well. Reckon Im gonna just gonna be thankful Ive got a hot shower to step into this morning to wash my ass. Thanks again. 
t1_dt4rdvj	0	*	I do not agree with punishing a child for their parents' crimes. It's unethical.
t1_dt3yszf	1	*	You won't even get wet from the tsunami if you submerge yourself in the tub and hold your breath!
t1_dt3wwfb	1	*	Can confirm. Getting more stubborn by the hour.
t1_dt3ykre	1	*	Huh, I always figured it had to be one or the other. I think this account supports your hypothesis.
t1_dt3za5c	0	*	Just curious, how old is the building you live in?
t1_dt3wvxo	1	*	IKR? Fox news has to get its viewership from somewhere

t1_dt40fb9	0	*	Ok.  Does what you just wrote do anything to refute my point?
t1_dtm20pn	0	*	There is literally no one better in the US than Hillary and Trump.
t1_dtqk24n	0	*	Then why do you want them blocked?
t1_dtgls5k	1	*	Well, it worked in Ukraine, didn't it.
t1_dtgn4w7	1	*	 Tusk is a German puppet, he got his current position as a reward for all he has done. Unfortunately I don't know about the development because I have not been following the story for a while.
t1_dupif57	1	*	For anyone else curious here's my only post in T_D. I think it's pretty A-political   https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/7gga6b/maga/?st=JE029J5X&sh=c25a6fe6
t1_duq0u9l	0	*	Name a country in which a socialist economy works.  You may be stupid tankie but you at least don't appear to be a marxist so I don't entirely hate your guts.
t1_duptw3l	1	*	So was that book.
t1_dupjmm4	1	*	> Almost, but you mean stapeln, not staplen.  Typo, thanks 
t1_duptt4u	0	*	No, as the sentence Wir legen, wir stapeln nicht makes zero grammatical and literal (?) sense.
t1_dupsc9h	1	*	They could. Show me your sources.
t1_duplnqy	1	*	Did. Just google nuclear waste leaks and scroll through the numerous leaking sites. Its completely unacceptable.
t1_dupq2gi	1	*	They wouldn't invade Germany or Sweden, but they have NATO partners they have pledged to support.
t1_dupxzr9	0	*	I think pathetic weasel is appropriate given your propensity to complain about lack of fortune in the land of opportunity.
t1_duvdnot	1	*	Yup!
t1_dupleb4	0	*	Aber ist sie auch gut?
t1_duprns7	1	*	Its not gonna happen man. Given the choice between taxing to pay off debt and cutting spending, taxing always wins because taxation doesnt create depressions. 
t1_dupiivc	0	*	I have no sources.  NSA does good work. They have a budget larger than the Russian GDP.   Do you really think they are just watching the trolls and not taking any counter-measures?  
t1_dupmp4k	0	*	Why are you comparing Germany to America, as opposed to comparing Germany now to Germany before mass migration?
t1_dupn1tb	1	*	You are right, I did not specify well 
t1_duqd1mi	0	*	That third of the graph is all that support the claims of the comment I originally responded to.   In any case, Im all done here. Thanks for playing sport. 
t1_duq2d8u	1	*	Zing
t1_dupxffq	1	*	I smell a loophole whereby I can not only evade my bills but also get some much needed entertainment! 
t1_dupx5uu	1	*	Would be great indeed.
t1_dupoc8r	0	*	Google It!  So you don't know and are spouting shit. Got it. 
t1_duqa0lz	1	*	If you're seriously asking this question, you probably shouldn't be a part of this discussion.
t1_duq2vpf	0	*	who told you that?
t1_duqhten	0	*	You have done nothing but use baseless ad hominems since you started commenting, so clearly you're not capable of forming an intelligent argument. Goodbye.
t1_duq4qt8	1	*	sounds plausible actually
t1_dupys9k	0	*	No, that's a lie.
t1_dus6n75	0	*	I guess the article is not proof that Germany is going down the toilet, but it is proof that immigration has driven up crime. 
t1_duphf7u	1	*	Even so... compared to Europe? Surely no contest. 
t1_dupps3l	0	*	I assume most of them favor Bernie over Hillary. I think they have quite a bit of influence 
t1_dupgzu9	0	*	No it's not. Germany is the most powerful country in the EU and they'll be running the show. Other nations might not want that.
t1_dupxij0	0	*	Leave the conversation to the adults, please.
t1_dupsysd	1	*	True, but conventional weapons take time to build, and design of they aren't not up to date.  
t1_dupv4u6	0	*	Why are you being an asshole when no one is being an asshole to you?
t1_dupoxr5	1	*	Give a dog a bone?
t1_durlyey	0	*	Yes literally everything my country does is failing, and the rest of the world is rosey peaches and perfect.
t1_dupqs2j	0	*	Now for Germany this somehow doesn't apply. Internet is shit in almost all (in the most widest possible meaning) rural parts.
t1_dupr27f	0	*	Putin has reignited the Tsardom.
t1_dupm6yr	0	*	Wat
t1_dupidam	0	*	Okay... But what's the point in whatever you're implying; why would they want to do this?
t1_dupsfhj	0	*	Spending savings means you are running a deficit. 
t1_duqwu1y	1	*	Reminds me of the saying that government surplus is the people's debt.  Just because the budget was positive for the year, why celebrate if there are faults with public service and infrastructure...
t1_duq4k3m	1	*	Good grief. 
t1_dupzaqc	1	*	Im a Brit living in Singapore, so swing and a miss there bud. There are more places in the world than the EU and America :) 
t1_duqg6o9	1	*	Ohh
t1_dupkfmz	1	*	Absolutely nothing, nothing at all. We surely don't have a historical precedent for *that* ever happening...right...? *Right?!*
t1_dupnbx2	1	*	Unfortunately there are loads of non-uranium based waste products from nuclear power.
t1_dur260p	1	*	Don't ruin my story ;)
t1_dupgdsz	1	*	I mean I don't see what's wrong with having a national culture and identity. We all need to come together, but we don't need open borders and one worldly culture. It's okay to be different.
t1_dupqu0t	0	*	It's not about the huge increase but rather the lack of a decrease. Instead of shutting down nuclear they could have shut down coal power plants of equal output.
t1_dupsum5	1	*	That the opposite of what he's saying.
t1_dupkphx	1	*	The EU economy is slightly smaller than the US' yet the EU has 50% more people. Again, the idea that the US can't afford something that the EU can just doesn't add up.
t1_duq5n3w	1	*	nicht nach passchier nacht
t1_dupipoz	1	*	I don't think anyone suspects they plan to, or would benefit from invading europe. 
t1_duput25	1	*	Wow, that's just over 278400 rods.
t1_dupnkx9	0	*	And the problem with small government is that its not powerful enough to stop corporations, so you end up with just much if not more corruption 
t1_duq44fj	0	*	Ich auch :) 
t1_dusuad8	1	*	So no reference to provide a source for your claim. Got it. That's all you needed to say.   And that's how you shut them down people. 
t1_dupwtlw	0	*	Nah we all make mistakes. I made one two comments above, in fact.
t1_dupjqnn	1	*	I care because it smells bad, the butts end up on the ground and sometimes start fires. Cigarettes are a public nuisance. 
t1_duqaibh	0	*	In a flat share. 60mxb2 and 3 people... that's crazy. 
t1_dupibbm	1	*	Oh did fuck up my grammar sorry but the point of the comment still remains 
t1_duqx3ft	1	*	on the other side of my state the best you can get around our farm town is still dsl that runs about ~56k in reality
t1_dtn9o1v	1	*	Sneaky? My man literally compares Trump to Churchill. Churchill would lay trump over his knee
t1_dtmysp0	0	*	I don't think many people are going around defending Flynn my friend. 
t1_dtna3an	0	*	The.... the memo
t1_dtn55um	0	*	Wow how do u believe what ur saying? If Trump was caught saying anything like that to the Russian prime minister you would hear about it 24/7 for months on CNN and other left leaning news sources.
t1_dtnvez8	0	*	I took the original remark to refer to Russia and collusion in this election.
t1_dtncw3t	0	*	Regardless of how you view Flynn, how he lied to the FBI is not affected.  And what I described is how it went down according to the official record.
t1_dtndvlj	0	*	Cough Cough! Email chain between Don Jr and Russian Commie. If you can't see accept this as fact them all hope is lost for you.
t1_dt6t4kg	0	*	Yeah but who is consuming and buying this kind of music? The people are. 
t1_dsrlnn4	0	*	That's not new tho and they're capable of changing the laws the same way the rest of the world slowly is. An 8 month sentence just for having THC in your system is just fucking ludicrous.
t1_dsdnbfn	1	*	Nope, not a single part of that was anything that I'm saying.
t1_dt6y2es	0	*	I don't intend to police anyone. I'm just agreeing with the majority and telling you it's pointless to try to correct them.
t1_dt6jr21	0	*	*You* are annoying to constantly see as a response. It's not my fault that your panties are all up in a bunch.
t1_dt6i0jj	1	*	Textbook whataboutism

t1_dt6qo8i	0	*	At least i'm not dumb enough to take religion seriously 
t1_dt7gam5	1	*	You're the one who claimed 5% margin error is okay when discussing historical events. Socratic method hurts, doesn't it.
t1_dt65dvq	0	*	Lmao you really think that I think i'm superior to people like MLK and the rest? I just wasn't brought up under the same fables they were, so we believe different things.

t1_dt75g8b	0	*	You gonna tell me he conveniently did not read any of the reports made against the priests for decades? The only way he could not know is to be horribly negligent in his job.
t1_dt6tk2t	0	*	Used to. Still occasionally as a hobby. 
t1_dt6z169	1	*	For the most part, yeah. 
t1_dt7dtgo	0	*	Thousands?
t1_dt6krzq	1	*	Why is that people who get their jimmies rustled over religion being shown in a honest light always claim to be atheist before condemning other atheists?
t1_dt74vx0	1	*	? They have been influencing politics since forever. The latest was opposing safe contraception in phillipines.
t1_dt6oxda	1	*	Because your comments annoy us, well annoy you with the same level of mocking. 
t1_dt6ti13	0	*	you're assuming that the only reason that one would criticise religion is to feel superior. That's not always the case. 
t1_dt6n3vu	1	*	He's the voice of reason amongst clergy.
t1_dt71k5r	0	*	Thge best propaganda is the one that is mostly or entirely true.
t1_dt6s2hq	1	*	They said condoms don't stop AIDS and add a false sense of security, discouraging people at risk of AIDS from using condoms.  That's basically the same and certainly no better.
t1_dt8d19r	1	*	Was on mobile and auto correct screwed everything up, gimme a moment to fix it
t1_dt6knhr	0	*	 That would be a calzone, which is in fact a pizza sandwich.   I have supplies. I am well defended. I will die on this hill if I must. 
t1_dugsmf4	0	*	Am I the only one who thinks a true leftist (Bernie) had no chance of winning in an extreme right wing country like the US?
t1_dugrjtx	0	*	Those Scots sure are a contentious people, aren't they? 
t1_duh26b3	1	*	Hey man, you have a good night
t1_dugpx4z	0	*	Some might measure candidates by their view points, voting record, education, experience, etc. Measuring their worth *after* they lose or win the election seems a bit pointless. 
t1_dugx516	1	*	Ahh, well I wasn't talking about that. 
t1_duglwgz	0	*	Sure, the Republicans are actively encouraging gun violence. You sound like a rational, fact-based person.

t1_dugrjwr	0	*	that would make their national anthem The Bagpipes, then
t1_dugslkc	0	*	Btw, read on the russian probe. This is exactly the rethoric the russian kept pushing to divide the democrat vote.  I.e. youve been brainwashed.

t1_dugrkzp	1	*	He was a goddamn unicorn as far as black presidents go
t1_dugvqdk	0	*	Do you have a point or not? 
t1_dugvnqv	0	*	Republicans constantly vote along party lines, so yes they're much more lock step than Democrats. Fuck their theatrics and debates.

t1_dugrao2	1	*	This.  I may not have liked him but at least he did some good things and seemed more sincere in horrific events and not give thumbs up.
t1_dugwrp9	0	*	People have different issues and desires across the 50 states. United *States* of America.   Why are you so obsessed with race? 
t1_dugvlxb	1	*	You're right, just go get the bigger boat already.
t1_dugp41c	1	*	No, Trump's shit at that, too.  He just stayed at a Holiday Inn Express last night. 
t1_dugsfwl	0	*	Scotland has two national animals, the United Kingdom's Lion which is featured on its royal banner, and the Unicorn. But I don't know if that is an *official* thing.
t1_dugruwn	0	*	Welp... that beats the bald eagle on the majestic scale. 
t1_dugsp3t	0	*	Yes, because it is.
t1_dugs2xl	1	*	Perfection
t1_dugs1zm	0	*	Yes, I have, lol.    This thread just happens six times a day... im being purposefully obtuse.
t1_duh0spx	0	*	Not sure how you got that I'm worked up, you were the one who previously used all sorts of expletives.  I am just discussing.
t1_dugv3kn	0	*	Sorry, I'm not from the US and don't know what you mean by 'direct election'. I don't want to waste your time explaining it (unless you want to!), do you have a link?
t1_dugrq7t	1	*	There's no such thing as a perfect system so why bother changing anything?  Obviously not your point, but that's what it sounds like.
t1_dugumtl	1	*	un supportable for the majority of the country where are you pulling this out of? Independents didn't get to vote for him if they had he would have won. 
t1_dugyxy0	1	*	Yeah that's gonna need a bit of a source.
t1_dum7amg	0	*	https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/avatar/images/4/4c/Wan_Shi_Tong.png/revision/latest?cb=20140404204804
t1_dui26oa	0	*	Because she was setup to win it.
t1_dugrp8x	1	*	Well no, but even if perfect is impossible, that doesn't mean we shouldn't at least try to be better. 
t1_dugrp0f	1	*	Oh sorry I am an idiot lol. I did not see what you were saying.
t1_dugpdk7	0	*	Wasn't there something with super delegates meaning she did not win the popular vote for nomination? 
t1_dugzm0n	0	*	Somehow i knew you couldnt tell me thanks anyway
t1_dugpcxc	0	*	Dude this is just FALSE as fuck. Google Operation Fast and Furious sometime
t1_duh9h5m	0	*	I think u/phome83 meant Bucklebury ferry from LoTR: the raft the hobbits used to cross the river.
t1_dui47ne	1	*	This is exactly the kind of thinking that made him the President. If most(many) of you think like this, no wonder you have a low turnout, and look what that got you into. 
t1_dugs6wk	1	*	And there are *thousands* of cities like yours. It should without a doubt, be *number of fucking votes*.
t1_duh173j	0	*	Are you trolling?  They literally just rounded up the people who did that shit.  They're in jail.  http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/exclusive-senior-figures-tortured-and-beaten-saudi-purge-1489501498
t1_dugqacc	0	*	Blame the shitty DNC, not Dems in general. A lot of dems have turned their back on the DNC after the shit they pulled 
t1_dugt748	0	*	>  He has no Conservative Values  he has many conservative values, he hates blacks, muslims, gays, poors, and immigrants.
t1_dugs9qa	0	*	Because it is. 
t1_duhsyih	1	*	>  Slogans like It's her turn and If you don't support her, you're sexist  You know those were never actually slogans, right? You're literally talking about a strawman. 
t1_dugvvqk	0	*	because the winner reflects the voting populace's choice not if they would be better at the job.
t1_dugreqp	1	*	Because Scotland is a myth. Duh.
t1_duihxj9	1	*	I didnt say superpower, they are just hoping to do better in a Beijing lead world than they are in a Washington lead world. 
t1_dugsmit	0	*	I suppose the alternative is to pretend nothing is wrong and hope it doesn't happen again.   I prefer that w learn from the mistake and not give him four more years. 
t1_dugwmnz	1	*	That wasn't a bush, it was a tree.  Checkmate.
t1_dugv6as	0	*	Ah that's interesting, do you have a link about it? (Or could you explain it further if you don't mind).
t1_duh6ucc	1	*	well what do you know. the greeks say the same shit too. 'freedom or death'. it's even encoded into their flag.
t1_dui9428	0	*	Because they (we) aren't stupid, or evil. Again, I could call socialists stupid but I don't. You're just making politics more volatile than it already is. 
t1_dumerhn	1	*	Are you assuming the gender of your national animals? That's not very Canadian progressive. I would add some gender neutrality in the brew if you want to have a chance to succeed. 
t1_dugyq8t	0	*	Diablo*
t1_duioupz	0	*	The goal is less immigrants that are poor people and/or are criminals.  That is, by definition, a change.
t1_dugxppe	0	*	Interesting and thanks for enlightening me!
t1_dugrdjj	1	*	Scotland.
t1_dugrwoo	0	*	Hillary had a million more votes than Bernie in the nomination. 
t1_duhp01d	0	*	What has Trump killed again? Besides your hopes and dreams.
t1_dugq67r	1	*	Sanders would have lost.  Those same people that voted for the wall, abortion, and emails would never in a million years vote for a socialist.  
t1_dugryeg	0	*	They listened to the voters.
t1_dugv0zj	1	*	Hmm? I don't get it 
t1_dugsbkl	0	*	What makes you think the smear campaign wouldn't have convinced people they just didn't like him?
t1_dugoud3	1	*	Obama did some pretty dicey stuff, e.g. press freedoms.
t1_duiewlj	0	*	In an earlier comment to me you posted a blog article by the hill. Not even an actual article, but a fucking blog. Now when I post an actual article by them you want to claim bias?
t1_duh0vii	0	*	No, that's not why the EC exists.  That is a modern day justification of it.
t1_dugrsyk	0	*	Bernie lost the primary by millions of votes, it wasnt a matter of the DNC picking him or Hillary 
t1_du6w072	1	*	Weve come full circle, again.
t1_dt3435y	1	*	He may not have died right away (in the medical sense,) but that guy was dead the second he pulled that trigger, bud. Nothing would have been left of him to comprehend what was going on.
t1_dt2a7ty	0	*	Sorry... [Some people think you are the most important part of a Pizza.](https://i.redd.it/m561r10qk8uz.jpg)
t1_dtoeso7	1	*	You Can't Wake A Person Who Is Pretending To Be Asleep_ LOL
t1_dtlmo6p	1	*	That's pretty cool, the Russians have an interesting navy considering their naval limitations. 
t1_dtlr4lq	1	*	>barrel-less weapon  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USS_Cole_bombing 
t1_dtlnly8	1	*	Fair. I wouldn't say it out loud though
t1_dtx5w2r	1	*	Not and argument.  >If you disagree with me, you must be trolling.  What a brainlet.
t1_dtxmpfd	0	*	Nothing, besides occasional exercise and whatnot. Boredom and isolation is part of the punishment.  And before you ask, no I don't think prisoners should be put to work for commercial gains.
t1_dtwkwzj	0	*	When did I say that? 
t1_dtvwxh5	0	*	how is freshman year in college treating you?
t1_dudwu4z	1	*	Yes, overnight transition was hyperbole...congrats. It however is a much more accurate description than 30 years like the person I responded to said. 
t1_dudekkr	0	*	> Saying it doesn't make it true.  Exactly why the EU lost when they said that US meat posed a health risk. Saying it doesn't make it true.
t1_dud8ntn	0	*	Do you just assume everything in the US is crap just because its here?
t1_ductb6c	0	*	Not in my experience. It's every bit as good as the cheese I ate in France. Better in some cases. Those Cheeseheads make awesome cheese.
t1_dubz9rn	0	*	If China had changed the unfair practices the West wouldn't have to go through that process, ie to be treated fairly they HAVE to go through that process.
t1_duby5zk	0	*	super relevant
t1_ducmy6j	0	*	>No body wants to play with the US, even your own states dont agree with you.  Yet we remain the most influential nation in the world. Money talks.
t1_dxeckro	1	*	> Sounds like the US. Half of that is bullshit. lol  no u
t1_duco8xv	1	*	Whatever you say kid. 
t1_duh0f5m	1	*	> Ever  Lol, kk
