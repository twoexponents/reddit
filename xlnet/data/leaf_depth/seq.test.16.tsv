t1_dsblbwv	0	*	You still haven't answered the question I asked you. I doubt you have the capacity to.
t1_ds919ir	1	*	There are about as many 100 digit primes as there are atoms in the universe.
t1_du46917	0	*	Yes, the US helped China in the past.  We even resisted the USSR's contemplation of nuking China.  Things are different now.  And?
t1_dtj3dp6	0	*	Because you still didn't answer my questions because you have no idea what you are talking about bring your conspiracy theories r/syriancivilwar and get educated
t1_dunfh7e	1	*	I didn't, I was making the point that people have still used guns and bombs despite law and that the same is possible from all forms of attack
t1_dsf4u73	0	*	The problem is if you're wrong we are out of time. People have a financial incentive to lie to you and keep you confused.
t1_dsuswxq	1	*	Alright, like Israel, you show your commitment to conflict and shitty behavior. Peace out. 
t1_dv79jis	0	*	Ah well, thats a shame, but it will probably improve as more people sign up in the region and they can justify more backhaul. In the meantime there's nothing too wrong with near 100mbps. 
t1_ds5ie1b	0	*	Lmao youre going to defend yourself my admitting to paying women less because you could get away with it?  Okay haha
t1_ds5fio2	1	*	I agree that its not a simple solution, but I feel like there will be one. At the very least people should know what the averages are, so they know if they are being ripped off or not. 
t1_dtogwv6	0	*	Thanks for not being a jerk to me and for taking the time to read that old article. 
t1_du05uon	0	*	Youre right. And youve definitely given me something to consider in the whole thing with that first reply. Have a good weekend. 
t1_durs6l6	1	*	Pretty sure the reason we dont use them anymore is mutually assured destruction, but whatever.
t1_dtbr3ge	0	*	I am not claiming the government is arming cartels, I am saying the rather lax gun laws allow the cartels to arm themselves in America.
t1_dtgpweq	0	*	> The latter is confirmed to be more of Nunes' obstruction BS.   Nunes had nothing to do with it, the texts are universally acknowledged as being real.
t1_ds5k9u7	0	*	By inventing words or assimilation of words through other cultures to fill a gap in an existing language. Not by using an existing and defined word in an erroneous manner. 
t1_dupxy2p	0	*	I think it's clear from my post I was saying that in a calm manner ;)
t1_du8vohl	0	*	So you're argument is that it's not human life because it can die. Last I checked that was a very human quality.
t1_dsxo59x	1	*	Why would you joke about something like that? 
t1_dtw1ml5	1	*	> your hypocrisy   I don't eat meat.
t1_dtvujqm	0	*	That's pretty impressive. What did our forefathers do for 2 million years that allowed them to survive without cars? 
t1_dtvueba	0	*	No, not enough of one. That's the *point*.
t1_duo7brx	0	*	Accusing every dissent of bigotry is the essence of left wing authoritarianism. It's weird you put it that way.
t1_dupxlfc	0	*	You asked me to explain one benefit. I'm trying to do that, so no, I didn't move any goalposts.  Why are you avoiding my question?
t1_dttxzla	1	*	Hmmmmm, well that's what whataboutism is my friend and it is the only implication of your comment.
t1_dttemel	0	*	I think that 2 parties, one right wing and the other centre right but bizarrely described as left is inadequte for the size of the country and is unfit for purpose. 
t1_dtu07da	0	*	Russia was/is a hotbed of great thinkers, philosophy, economics, politics, etc. US? Not so much.
t1_dtulke0	0	*	Change your name to Mercator, because that's some world-class projection.
t1_dttm3oc	0	*	I didnt claim to be a radiologist either. Therapeutic Radiographer is what I said. Im not diagnostic but I would recommend seeing someone about your short term memory problems. 
t1_dtumk1o	0	*	No, I admit Im slowing down a bit. I definitely dont put in the hours that I used to. I could retire, but Im not quite 60 yet. Are you old enough to call me child?
t1_dtviz7t	0	*	Only in the sense that you get to choose which pizza, but your choice is super limited to the point where it's involuntary.
t1_du8tyjk	0	*	You ignored all the places with millions of participants, that's most convenient for your argument.  Korea, Ukraine and Spain all had millions of people involved.
t1_dte06d2	1	*	Maybe he meant in practice, not mathematically? The result is the same. Trump wins. 
t1_dte1i0r	0	*	You're a judgmental guy too I guess 
t1_dtf3448	0	*	You're asking for a list of senators as experienced and recognizable as Barack Obama was before he started running for president?
t1_dsuj36u	0	*	That was 53 years ago.  Edit: And Arafat, as leader of the PLO, recognised Israels right to exist in the 90's. So you're choosing the facts that suit your own view of the situation. 
t1_dv060a8	0	*	And still completely unnecessary.
t1_dsaytif	0	*	Right of conquest is bad.  Is that what you want me to say?  It was done for all of history and was fine then.  Its bad now.
t1_dupuphb	0	*	If you still can't have the modesty of reading the whole comment this is pointless. I'm done.  Criticism is racism and Bibi is our saviour.

t1_dt8ngaj	0	*	I'll tell you what: when you defend the claims you make, I'll respond to your post.  
t1_dunt5mu	1	*	Oh, that makes sense. I assume rates have gone up because, well, they can up the rates since they know candidates will pay whatever the price may be?
t1_dsi5fb3	0	*	You just gotta keep going in hopes of getting the last word huh?  Lmao pathetic.  What a loser! xD 
t1_duj7gz7	1	*	yeah i think he goes way too far, but the stuff the other one writes disturbs me a lot more. its ok to kill 20% of your country, because you engaged in a war? thats peaceful and fine? like wtf
t1_du23tt7	0	*	That's your best reply? was this not in your SF handbook?.....you should call in to SF HQ for more training.

t1_dskk39l	0	*	No, it's called moving out of liberal hell holes where building supply is far too low because of excessive regulation and permitting. 
t1_dsh9di6	0	*	Wait, I thought you said /r/OnGuardForThee was the intolerable sub? As soon as someone calls your statements into question, you attack. That's on you, son.
t1_ds59rho	1	*	Do you think that a trash importation agreement is limited in scope? 
t1_duo3sym	0	*	How am I biased against Russians? 
t1_dsmdtvp	1	*	You're special! 
t1_dt43tx8	0	*	I think you are giving yourself far too much credit for going around on r/Worldnews threads and bad-mouthing Israel.
t1_dudzlle	0	*	So blue and underground or invisible? 
t1_dvcn5so	0	*	soft power isn't being talked about anymore. I wonder if it was being forced two weeks ago.

t1_dt204k6	1	*	Damn...well put.
t1_dt1qfmf	1	*	Fine we can agree to disagree then.   
t1_dt1srs5	0	*	so like the cuban revolution where we line up dissenters in the streets and shoot them in the head? or how? No need to be hot on details.
t1_dt1dohu	1	*	Tell me your feelings, I explained some of mine...PS Im busy watching the Eagles, sooo
t1_duhg18n	0	*	You're just all over the place now, and can't make a single coherent argument. Ouch.
t1_duhypc0	0	*	Yep, looks like we're still over the target.
t1_duhz6uh	0	*	Apples and oranges. State governments jumping ship is not the same as civilians trying to force their will against governments.
t1_dtcoo3a	1	*	It's also well documented that the Dalai Lama was constrained by religion and tradition.  While certainly not a slave, he did have to do a lot of what he was told to do.
t1_dsn5e23	0	*	To give the receiver piece of mind that the transaction is valid and irreversible
t1_dv2706i	0	*	How many did you own? I have a significant investment these days, lol.
t1_dv0am2i	1	*	History's shown time and time again that soldiers will do whatever the fuck you tell them to regardless of how bad it is, look at Ahru Grahib, My Lai Massacre, Nazi Germany, Boer War etc.
t1_dt09t4a	1	*	It was just to emphasize how localized crime is
t1_dt4wuxu	0	*	Power to you, but your neighbour might not like you much. Just because it's legal to do something doesn't mean it's not a dick move.
t1_dt4b4pm	0	*	???? I'm pretty sure if it was medicinal it wouldn't be smoked, it'd be in pill form, doing it that way makes said apartments not smell like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surstr%C3%B6mming
t1_dtk4jsw	0	*	No, I'm just doing a weekly update on the antisemitic violent attacks you said didn't occur.

t1_dtdejdb	0	*	I am dumb or the other guy ?
t1_dtd3pnf	0	*	For the vast majoirty of abortions the method really doesn't matter as the embryo has not developed the nervous system to feel and not desire pain.
t1_dtggzb9	0	*	What's your point? 
t1_dsrge7h	1	*	Seems medical to me
t1_dt9n4dt	0	*	Its fun seeing how your brain works. And pipe down...how basic. Im almost disappointed.   What an enjoyable conversation this was. 
t1_dt99kro	0	*	Haha okay now try playing devil's advocate for your own argument. Can you come up with anything that highlights how hamfisted it is? I can give you hints.
t1_duignhu	1	*	Yes, that would be a hurdle.
t1_duibtqf	0	*	Sounds about right. My quick to call BS mostly due to me completely forgetting that 6 figure salaries dont only exist in metropolitan areas on the coasts :)
t1_duk57s5	0	*	Oh. I see. Then that's definitely Obama's fault. All that will change with this new administration because they are following sound economic policy.
t1_duic2fu	1	*	I appreciate the insult, but being rich doesn't necessarily correlate to hoarding money like a dragon.
t1_duiald8	0	*	Youre so fucking wrong its actually quite laughable. I work with 200 dairy farmers myself in one county that are worth less than 5 million. 
t1_dtev1e1	0	*	I enjoyed your comments, they made me laugh out loud (stifled laugh in office).
t1_dsgquhy	0	*	source for that?
t1_dtdiq27	1	*	Depends how long you're trying to go for mate, I'm reaching for that 60-70 range and also realize I can die any day of the week completely randomly.
t1_dte67d9	0	*	I'm not - just that it's disingenuous to pretend that just because you can't control 60%, you shouldn't bother changing the 30%
t1_dsmi1l4	0	*	But merit-based is discrimination, don't you know the definition of discrimination?   >Discrimination: Recognition and understanding of the difference between one thing and another.  
t1_du2opzq	1	*	> Youre not worth the energy it would take to say all these things.  And yet, you're screaming at me. Its like you think I care. How weird.
t1_dt45cch	0	*	So go ahead and cite specific words, and I will then point out how you have deceptively left out the important parts that completely undermine your claims.
t1_duuh3of	0	*	I love how you don't address your government's history of assassinating people.
t1_duq2x69	0	*	No one cares what you were thinking, you're bad at it.  Don't reply.

t1_dt97355	0	*	Shrug.
t1_dtefvsx	0	*	I wouldn't be surprised. Turkey has committed lots of atrocities

t1_dt2osc3	0	*	> Would you like to answer my other questions now?  Apparently not.
t1_dsdtps9	0	*	So, you're *not* claiming he's worse than Bush by using an analogy that literally says if not worse, as in, you think it's worse.  Gotcha.
t1_dsdpyka	0	*	> When did I use it as a defense for Trump? I must have missed where I said that.  ...you were literally responding to a question of why do conservatives defend Trump?  Are you drunk, orrrr....

t1_dtdwfgy	1	*	You're right. Game over man. USA boooooo.
t1_dted8nq	1	*	They said they didn't know anything. They didn't say I'm not an expert. Their literal statement was: I dont live there or know very much about the country
t1_ds3991q	0	*	you're comparing american US dollers with nigerian US dollers, that doesn't make any sense if you're not dividing it by the amount of oil and the solar energy too
t1_dufbelm	0	*	That wasnt my intended meaning. I changed it.  U dont have to be pretentious about it
t1_dstz0ip	0	*	Yup. They're so disturbed by him they're like, Fuck this, this guys nuts and can't stick to the script. Unified Korea #1. We out. Peace.

t1_dsvbrx0	0	*	And in my original comment I literally said that same thing, good job bringing us full circle. 
t1_ds7wv7h	0	*	What do you mean gave up? Do you know how small Taiwan is, there's no place to test the technology, how do you get around to developing it.
t1_ds7x240	0	*	Oh dear god, you're actually this stupid? This is so adorable.
t1_dshjffa	0	*	But that's not what I'm saying.  I said exactly what I meant.  Again, you're willing to destroy the infrastructure cause you didn't get to buy the exact car you wanted.

t1_dslcepr	1	*	It's like they're being told they have cancer but they keep calling it the flu. It's like yea, the flu is a complication, probably due to the cancer, but you still have cancer!

t1_du6pkg1	0	*	> I'm sure the foreign investors are going to love investing it a country that confiscates land without process of law and compensation.   That never seemed to be a problem during the apartheid years.
t1_dumx4sw	0	*	So, you are still in your probation period for the troll job.   Go on girl, gotta make those points to get a raise and get the job secured.

t1_dtnhxwu	1	*	It appears that it was only a part of the reasoning for asking for a warrant extension. FBI warned this memo has glaring omissions

t1_dv58me4	1	*	It wouldn't matter where it came from.  The Treasury department announced they were not currency manipulator.  You can google it if you want.  As an aside, the NYT are not that bad

t1_du19jto	0	*	Im not going to blame a bunch of idiots who voted for one of their own. Have at it though. Im sure you blaming them will help them not repeat the same mistakes in 2020.
t1_dsnbszn	0	*	I cant continue on like this. Its like trying to explain colors to a blind man. Best of luck to you. 
t1_dtzh7cy	0	*	I mean you can keep repeating the same obvious advice: fix your shitty diet and go exercise that they've been giving everyone forever, but people are rarely willing to do it because it require effort.
t1_duvgra3	0	*	Yes- they agreed not to specifically have their anthem played.  They violated that agreement.  Its black and white yet you still try to make a point
t1_ds5f4on	1	*	I'm not the one that has jumped into a discussion someone else had and spend hours trying to argue for them
t1_ds48nc6	0	*	Even if that's true, what is gained by taunting someone like this? Do you think this is a strategic move he ran by his staff?
t1_ds5hfcz	1	*	I don't need to define it, it's quite obvious. If it had been about **race** then America would have sent Koreans and Chinese and other Asians also to camps. 
t1_dv1roai	1	*	Hah. He's got a big one, that's for sure but that's not uncommon for these entitled elite types.
t1_dv1vddi	0	*	I can respect that opinion, even though I believe it is narrow-minded and will hold back your ability to understand the whole picture of the climate of US politics.
t1_dugdw84	1	*	Yeah I imagine most people would do their best to resist complying with unethical laws. There would be enormous public backlash for a law like that.
t1_du11q5j	0	*	Notice how the vegan poster says go vegan. It doesn't just advertise a vegan meal, it tries to convert. The other posters advertise but don't post a big Go meat-eater. Nice try though.
t1_du0527s	0	*	I'm okay with that
t1_dtzy71j	1	*	No, they wouldn't - but the question I had to ask myself is that if I personally would find it disturbing, then why am I eating it?
t1_du0x7kf	0	*	I'm not the one losing my mind over this.
t1_dt3zwc7	0	*	Would you like to share the list of Chinese inventions from after 1950?  Thats the only thing that can prove that I'm wrong...
t1_dtota5n	0	*	Lmfao yes me, the liberal 
t1_dtpaihq	1	*	I think you also forgot: The best, most well trained, and more technologically advanced military and intelligence network in the world?
t1_du56rpc	1	*	That makes sense. Thanks. 
t1_dtdqu0w	0	*	okay GAYMONF
t1_dtns44l	0	*	Wow. No need to throw insults. You really can't handle proper debate.
t1_dtb30wl	1	*	I knew about that one, I just figured you would need to interact in some way with the blockchain to generate a key. 
t1_dszc6wa	0	*	God you must be insufferable to talk to.
t1_dszd13x	0	*	> If they were that important to you, you would seek them out elsewhere.  What makes you think I don't?
t1_duxl0ps	1	*	I think this guys definition of not bad is 'NATO hasnt disbanded yet.'
t1_dslpd18	0	*	Nah, my argument stands.
t1_dsinj1s	1	*	Maybe try some  cofeve or whatever word salad you understand from President dipshit.
t1_dso5wnt	0	*	Yes they do. The casualties for cast lead and other misguided adventures from israel are well documented. Hamas is more successful at hitting armed members than israel is.
t1_dt91362	0	*	Than explain me please, why a country shouldn't want to join an economic union along with 27 other countries? 
t1_dt9gfgd	1	*	What does that ever mean? 
t1_dtbd1qk	1	*	And I see no reason to change my assessment of the American public.  I will not be surprised if Donald Trump gets re-elected for another term. 
t1_dtwx57g	1	*	I don't want to get banished like the FBI directors. 
t1_dtz34ie	0	*	Because people think if America acts like Norway, we will be unequivocally better off. And that is not true. 
t1_dudaxps	0	*	Well, Israel is a Jewish state and is the self acclaimed homeland of the Jews and culture. 
t1_dud1fdb	0	*	I already went further in-depth than this with the definition. Again, the fallacy itself is the exact same. The detail surrounding it isn't relevant to the fallacy.
t1_ducue45	0	*	Which would those be? China, NK, and Cuba? They most certainly are.
t1_dt0uumq	0	*	I know, but i am not talking about the past. I am talking about present day. Of course Europe has the most war deaths, they had both world war I and II. 
t1_dt1nsxn	1	*	Huh, so what you seem to be saying here is that submitting to a repressive dictatorship in exchange for stability isnt the optimal path? Interesting...
t1_dt0ugp5	0	*	I do not like a kid who knows nothing of terrorism getting killed. 
t1_dt0yons	0	*	Oh really? And i bet you think xerxes went into greece with 1 million men too lol.
t1_dsb1qmr	0	*	Educate yourself instead of ignoring facts like the rest of catholics   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church_sexual_abuse_cases
t1_dus6ub1	0	*	Zero? Do you live in a fantasy world?  Japan gun deaths per 100,000: 0.06 America gun deaths per 100,00: 10.54  Americas gun deaths is 175 times higher than in Japan.
t1_dsdoic9	0	*	Oh cool... guess I won't worry about the police next time
t1_dswn70f	1	*	Yeah, I don't vote for anti gun politicians. Hillary lost, remember? 
t1_dur6e04	0	*	And who will pay them if they lose because of a not large enough force?
t1_dsm61ad	0	*	Seriously mate. Go for a walk or something. It's not healthy to be this angry.
t1_duampsm	0	*	I'm asking what I can do for this minutes-old acct, as you can plainly see. Why so defensive?
t1_dua0ggz	0	*	My point was ultra-processed foods is a useless descriptor and I think we've worked well together to show that.
t1_dumfesq	1	*	Hahah Yeah, if we put an ADT security sign outside every school that said there are cameras and teachers have guns might help. 
t1_dum9t41	0	*	No they dont. Since 2000 Australia has had this happen five times.
t1_dtrpcj4	0	*	Take your weak comebacks with you, when you go.
t1_dtrh023	0	*	Of course they are the same thing. Both groups are equally disgusting. But one sure as hell gets treated way differently than the other.
t1_dsjzodf	0	*	Lol, I love how youre wasting your energy and time responding to a bigot. 
t1_dsm6tuh	0	*	The question above is about Trump's suitability as a role model. When the needle is swinging between sexual predator and show-off douchebag, then I think there's a problem.
t1_dsk2ya3	1	*	Did I say anything about hitting a switch?   >It just makes Trump look stupid.  That's the fucking point. 
t1_dsjw3bs	0	*	LOL you think only 1 journalist there was not a white supremacist? That is absurd.
t1_dsjvw33	0	*	My argument is that the people in the US are shittier so it's easier to make money there. That's it. Money, capitalism. Everyone in the world hates Americans but still move there to make money.
t1_dsk045j	0	*	And also completely different than what we'd have here.. 
t1_dsk879l	0	*	Iraq. Iran. Cuba. Germany. Japan. Korea. Yemen. Libya.  All countries we control(led) by use of or threat of force. There's more countries than that by the way.  
t1_dsm7aso	0	*	I agree that the prez is a moron for saying this. Even though it was said in private      By the way, you're from Africa, right? 
t1_dtrvxsn	0	*	Are you pretending immigration fixes quality of life?
t1_dtwgvpy	0	*	Cool then. Just have circumcision carry the same punishment as the equivalent FGM (removal of clittoral hood). Oh wait, the punishment for that is prison too.  
t1_ds7laxb	0	*	so, your answer is for the government to come up with whatever narrative they can justify in the end? Or I guess in this case whatever two narratives.
t1_dt0e7vt	1	*	I don't follow US politics but from what I can see online, Trump hasn't done much wrong other than open his mouth and offend certain people.   If I'm wrong can you please fill me in
t1_dtyes1y	1	*	Getting up at 5:30 would be pretty normal, tbh.  I got up at 5:45 the year I went to the earlier school.  Yes, those schools got out much earlier.  Like 2-2:30.
t1_dtysebm	1	*	Well then its a good thing a kilogram is a unit of mass, not weight...
t1_dugo1wy	0	*	The dossier is the equivalent of a smoking company sponsoring a study that says smoking isn't bad.  
t1_ds3ipfo	1	*	strangely it's religion that has no sense of humour...i wonder why that is?
t1_dsbqo53	0	*	Maybe you're confusing that with the [One Million Plan](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Million_Plan)?  A well documented policy of Zionist colonisation.
t1_dsltoup	1	*	And New Zealand, too. Have a chip, bro!  
t1_dtlb7lx	0	*	Well talking to you is pointless
t1_dtmgwzg	0	*	Its dishonest to make it a two way street anyway. Its generally Muslim supremacist, and sometimes (especially toward recent years) also specifically antisemitic.
t1_dtm0i6x	0	*	Won't happen before the Cultural revolution old guards die, they're still kicking. Harmonious overlord Xi certainly erasing some progress but I hope its temporary.
t1_dudgvd6	0	*	Also, him saying she's unqualified is laughable. She was First Lady, Senator, and secretary of state. There's like, 2 people who had her chops and both of them didn't run. 
t1_dudawrw	1	*	What has trump actually done that is worthy to be riled up?
t1_dudmkfu	0	*	LOL the deflection, SAD!  C'mon dude post those receipts.
t1_dudjalr	1	*	The literal way it was written happened to be the silliest
t1_dub5xi7	0	*	I was looking for proof, not specious lies.
t1_dtibtfm	0	*	There's something wrong when you're unable to categorize things into smaller groups.
t1_dt7x2ug	0	*	Ive provided sources and you provide random thoughts without any support. Were done.
t1_dt0jxw8	1	*	I just replied to it now.   >militant vegan that's full of hot air.  I'm not, and you are full of shit.
t1_du61s9n	0	*	Show me where I claimed it to be fact, or kick rocks. 
t1_duekdxl	0	*	It sounds to me like excuses to hurt the solar industries growth so you can keep producing oil and gas as long as possible.
t1_ds6eu6l	0	*	Read the articles I sent
t1_dtkup3b	0	*	Here he is lying about a lie he told. https://news.grabien.com/story-michael-wolff-goes-twitter-rampage-after-msnbc-humiliation
t1_dsn9i3y	1	*	You seem a lot more upset than I am. 
t1_duyjd9s	0	*	> I'm an internet troll, my actions have no reflections on my person at all  Yet you are compelled to respond poorly. 
t1_dv41lcx	1	*	Yep, definitely freaked out bro.
t1_dv3bg5a	0	*	I'm sorry, I forget, what ruby red state lost a senate seat just 4 months ago to a democrat?
t1_dv3imav	0	*	Your lack of self awareness is as embarrassing as it is unsurprising. 
t1_dv518my	1	*	You mentioned it as one of the places you got banned. I didn't say you got autobanned from r/politics did I? You got a reading comprehension issue?
t1_dv3nh0n	1	*	Whatever makes you feel comforted.
t1_dt5er3b	0	*	No, what you're doing right now is projection. I said confirmation bias.
t1_dt60jl9	1	*	Sure.  If Lincoln was what you could call a role model leader, then people should be mildly satisfied with Trump. Even he sounds less racist than Lincons memories.
t1_dsf57pg	0	*	The movement is much broader than that now. Otherwise kneeling for the national anthem would not make any sense. 
t1_dsfkdxs	0	*	I doubt you would even then.
t1_dubh4zv	0	*	And this is somehow bad ?  
t1_dtz3lil	0	*	I never shit on Obama for being black. In fact I'd be just as happy with Ben Carson, Thomas Sowell, or Herman Caine as president. Your obsession with race makes you the racist by definition.
t1_dtl7gf8	1	*	Cool, I just had a problem with you insinuating the notion that private industries want to increase wages 
t1_dtljvo0	1	*	> l8r  Okay, I'm not actually leaving. The problems of the world cannot be solved if everyone walks away or shoves it away. Be one to find the Climate Cure, or do something amazing.
t1_dthzjpb	0	*	False. You lost, just accept reality.
t1_dthrpro	0	*	Gender Dysphoria - But yeah... I'm checking out of this discussion because dude is backed into a corner and where he was embarrassingly corrected and he is just lashing out now. 
t1_dthstej	0	*	Because no one in that book has come forward saying its bullshit have they ............................
t1_dssme8z	0	*	So long as the state exists there is no freedom. When there is freedom there will be no state.   -Lenin
t1_dshk7lg	0	*	Yeah...  There are no laws denying healthcare to Americans. If you said America denys universal healthcare then i would agree, and I wish we had universal healthcare here. 
t1_ds2vycl	1	*	I wonder if he's gonna head to CCJ2 and have a sook. He probably couldn't handle the truth (hue) and is now jerking himself off over his apparent ability to see through our lies.
t1_dthfs7c	0	*	If you believe that congress is going to cut massive waste, I have a bridge to sell you. 
t1_dthbkql	0	*	Officers are sworn to uphold the constitution.
t1_dt4z8sy	0	*	I've never even heard of naloxogel! Another good question.  Shit's expensive though.
t1_dv2u69u	1	*	obviously i mean you managed to make emails into audio and then slap a russian pmc talking to officials gotta give credit to that 
t1_du0zb5j	1	*	I cant try to explain anything if youre just going to lump me in with those in the same thread. Like I said, I wouldnt necessarily call him evil either - please do not put words in my mouth.
t1_dup7yqn	0	*	You are in denial just like Turks. lol
t1_ds2gbby	0	*	Again I'm not really arguing against a true blue water navy. That has clear value. I just think we would be better served with a different fleet composition.
t1_dto7y0z	1	*	A lot of fairly wealthy Jewish people were supporting Israel's establishment. That's where the money is from.
t1_ds8afs1	0	*	???
t1_du8yc7f	0	*	Because Im not stupid enough to build on low lying land?
t1_dsgxzbs	0	*	everything you said about Clinton is also true of Bibi though, except he's actually better at getting those votes.

t1_dtfrf2c	0	*	So you want me to prove the existence of culture? Do you disagree that culture exists? Or do you disagree that culture influences people? 
t1_dtf0p7x	0	*	I didn't know me being true to myself was harming the minority. Can i be a victim too?
t1_dv132gl	1	*	LOL. bruh, I nearly certainly make more than you. Just admit when you are wrong.
t1_duciqjs	0	*	You stalking me bro?
t1_du7erjc	1	*	Or, maybe the better lesson to learn is if you're going to wage war on a far superior enemy, maybe consider the possible ramifications of losing. 
t1_du6zk1q	0	*	Is it? Because both of you seem quite upset, actually. 
t1_dsm5kbm	1	*	We know. That's my point.
t1_dsqiani	0	*	You mentioned Canada's military strategy separately, before you typed the aforementioned comment.
t1_dt6d6je	1	*	ok buddy, have a great day
t1_dtwpstg	1	*	Your not wrong.
t1_dtvg59b	1	*	How so?
t1_dt3lkfo	0	*	Which is just a large slow river :\^)
t1_dt1utkr	0	*	If only you had finished high school, or went on a diet, you would not be so unhappy.
t1_dt31kqn	1	*	Do you always just laugh when you dont have a valid answer?   Im not saying being unemployed isnt hard Im just saying if it was easy everyone would quit their jobs. 
t1_dt26v09	0	*	He's saying that there's no mathematical way every person who works hard and smart would end up with the amounts that the very rich have.
t1_dsk9xdf	1	*	That's cute. 
t1_dsgwwr4	1	*	And India has 4 more to join in Q1 18. And funds released for 80 mk1a.   That is how everything progress, I guess.
t1_duhdkqc	0	*	It was truely amazing it went as smoothly as it did. We absolutely were expecting the worst then... nothing. And that was my AO too ;P
t1_dskwmp9	1	*	Yup... those 18 to 21 year old interns we have are *so* different. lol
t1_duiz153	1	*	>If you can't see that as logically just mental illness I don't know what to tell you.   People who are bullied commit suicide at a high rate as well. Is being bullied a mental illness?
t1_dujxgb2	0	*	I couldnt find any. Guess you were wrong. The one link I could find detailing similar cases showed that (lack of) intent was the critical factor in determining whether it was prosecuted or not.
t1_ds79xv7	0	*	unfortunate but you still, day after day, pay people to torture them.  despite having an alternative better for them, yourself, and the environment  
t1_dtu0hvh	0	*	so....i'm not disagreeing with you...i'm saying that people aren't just killed and 'never returned'

t1_dsvhuq3	0	*	I saw something yesterday that said the art of respectfully disagreeing, or peaceful difference, is at risk here in the United States. I agree. 
t1_dsuxzgd	0	*	Wrong again.   Im not assuming anything. I see clearly that your statements are demonstratably false despite your behaving like a childish prick. You cant even read your own links correctly. 
t1_dszd578	0	*	There are none so blind, I suppose.  Good day.
t1_dsvdzop	0	*	There's no indication that Obama line was an intentional deception. 
t1_dsutoz2	0	*	Nobody is arguing that, you just keep throwing out red herrings.  Obvious you are just trolling now so I'm done.
t1_dsuuoas	1	*	I misread what you typed. I thought the part you quoted was taken as something I said. The ya'll healthcare part.
t1_dsv1qlj	0	*	Because there's no evidence it has ever happened. Which means it probably hasn't happened. Which therefore means it's perfectly reasonable to assume it has never happened.
t1_dsx3j63	0	*	True, but it points out hypocrisy and double standards, which means, the left has no credibility, so I don't care what their criticisms are. 
t1_dskkhii	0	*	>the second or third generation after each immigrant group wants to pull up the ladder.  Oh neat, that means itll be my turn soon.

t1_dstfpug	0	*	The end result is a dead chicken, morally there is no difference. In fact, it's probably morally better to do it yourself - no transport or storage so less environmental damage.
t1_dst64ip	0	*	If going into a country, toppling the regime and paving the way for ISIS is just making friends then please remind me to never make friends with you.
t1_dst3daw	0	*	Im not here to enlighten you though. Dont know why you keep insisting that I do. Maybe www.devry.edu can help? Enlightenment on the cheap and you dont have to deal with any jimmies rustled!
t1_dtgld1f	0	*	only if enough people go to the polls and vote red and not enough people don't go and don't vote blue. 
t1_dtkq0ch	1	*	It should stop considering premeditated murder as the first and only option. 
t1_dsjcbrj	0	*	So you want me to do the research for you? In what reality does that make any sense? I just wanted something besides a youtube link to review. 
t1_dtl3yuc	1	*	Okay I can definitely get behind that point. Just a general misunderstanding then.
t1_dsayycd	1	*	Im never giving up bacon, I just hope it comes from a lab. I did stop once for about a month after seeing a truck full of pigs. Just glad I don't have to murder them myself.
t1_dsaeudt	0	*	You didn't ask me to clarify anything, you said I didn't say what I just said. And I already explains that farming animals is worse for the environment due to the deforestation.
t1_dtn71vk	0	*	I voted for Jill Stein, thanks. You have presented to me nothing to validate the Steele dossier.
t1_dtawzjy	1	*	85-90% the point, +-5% I would say
t1_duaf80k	0	*	If the EU is so weak and the UK leaving doesn't matter in the big scheme of things, why did Russia interfere?
t1_dtruh5p	0	*	Thanks for the debate. I don't think the English justice system is known for being particularly soft, so I think he will face appropriate justice. 
t1_dus404q	0	*	How much do you think this affects politics
t1_dsvorz0	0	*	Okay, so you're just an idiot who doesn't understand logistics and thinks there's a boogieman stopping him. Got it, we're done here.
t1_dtd157v	0	*	I'm a UK citizen, living in England, for what it's worth. Russia is a mafia state. 
t1_dstjrki	0	*	It is deeply flawed and needs to be changed.
t1_dv3fq5c	0	*	No, Pearl Harbour was the main reason the US got involved. They didn't give a damn about passenger ships lol.
t1_dt7bk6n	0	*	Luckily there are more than 2 car companies in the world. You'd see a bump in all vehicle sales except ford. The production capacity is already here.
t1_dt6p3x3	1	*	That's because most middle-eastern countries are warzones that have been ravaged by Soviet and Western interference, and have never had time and opportunity to recover.
t1_dt6yeii	0	*	But it's not even 10%, as you pointed out. 
t1_duq5sdf	0	*	> Let's not pretend that trivializing rape gets downvoted.  Am I pretending that trivializing rape gets downvoted?

t1_dtrah7i	1	*	Fair enough.  And you've definitely made me think more about the option of a conditional surrender.

t1_dsmpj5n	0	*	Which can only be hypocrisy if they are related...

t1_duftbt7	0	*	Yes you are. You are wrong and your cynical attitude make things worse. No point in advocating for peace when pseudo intellectuals are yammering about bismuth and calling us all pirates
t1_dt5dae6	0	*	Right but thats not what we are talking about. We are discussing most Mexican immigrants amazing work ethic. You dont need to make this into a justice thing 
t1_dt6fnfc	0	*	Maybe in your mind.
t1_dt5ocxk	0	*	Yup I'm the one completely ignoring reason and scientific proof while saying buzzwords and attacking your character to make my argument appear stronger. 
t1_dt6byr2	0	*	Do you seek to impose those beliefs on other countries?
t1_dsdyvva	1	*	Was it worth it? Yes, of course. For the home of the brave, you Americans seem really frightened of everything.

t1_dt91vmo	0	*	I'm sure they care whether or not YOU find them reputable.   Wikipedia is ok for some information but it can't be used as a source when the information can be changed by a 6yr old.
t1_dv0s161	1	*	Guy, we're talking about this specific event in which you've already agreed that the intent was not to incite hatred towards muslims. You are lost and confused about what we're even discussing
t1_dv15526	0	*	That follow Le Pen on Twitter? Sure, why not. That comes down to the parents. You shouldnt make your kindergartener a Twitter account and have him follow politicians but you still can if you want.

t1_dui0xg3	0	*	Which they do. The lack of visible minority individuals allows for the scapegoating of these people, which allows the government can grab more power by bringing in emergency restrictions against them.
t1_ds4qt9d	1	*	Lol
t1_ds4quvo	1	*	You're playing some weird head games with this one. Good luck in life. :)
t1_dsump0l	0	*	Whats your view on climate change? Just curious, I was reading through the rest of your responses. 
t1_dsum6i2	0	*	You just said bernie was far left
t1_dsuf30m	0	*	Yes, corporations laying off thousands after the passing of the tax cut is a great improvement /s. I'm not criticizing a president. I'm criticizing the whole system.
t1_dtrb0qv	0	*	Again post Independence, war and exile of Palestinians.
t1_ds53yna	0	*	You sure about that? Ive been very clear and concise in my words/thoughts. This isnt Magic ya know..

t1_dt702x6	0	*	Ben...where is your evidence?  Trump did nothing 
t1_dt6m0yw	1	*	Yeah, Im sure that it true. It doesnt change the facts about Russia in the 2016 election. Im sure it is entertaining if you treat it like a spectator sport and I can tell that is all this is to you.
t1_dt9yulg	0	*	You're deflecting criticism away from Trump/Russia. No honest person would do that.
t1_dt6e32f	0	*	Nah see you're making excuses. She was involved in a sketch and didn't object to the usage of CPT.
t1_dstzii0	1	*	Therein lies the problem.
t1_dshgxya	0	*	What a woefully ignorant comment. America doesn't have culture? HAHAHAHA. Ok, bud. Tell your comrades hello from my taint.
t1_dtyhfso	0	*	Did you read the memo? 
t1_dsla1mn	1	*	Lmfao dude you can't be real 
t1_dsddlmd	0	*	The book continues a narrative. I'm not denying this, hence the confirmation of biases causing some to blindly believe the narrative the book produced.
t1_dsvi84n	1	*	True. But they have nukes
t1_ds3ukpo	0	*	Lol like you didnt try to trap me with the warhawk/hillary lol. Just admit youre being lame brah. 
t1_dt8yrzf	1	*	Dang, you got me again.  Damn kids.
t1_duwdqag	1	*	Then copy paste it, for my benefit, you liar.
t1_duweuqj	1	*	[books I read on this subject this year](https://ibb.co/dXEt7c)  [library of books I got in the last two years- I give them away once read.](https://ibb.co/hMdaLx)
t1_du36he9	0	*	Lost cause. What a fucking waste.
t1_dtraqi4	0	*	As an example of the goalposts you like to move, you just added majority of Australia's labour force, which no one has ever talked about before. 
t1_dsb3611	0	*	We still can't allow an unlimited amount of people into the country, wouldn't you agree? In order to have a comprehensive legal road the illegal one needs to close. 
t1_dsbpb2s	0	*	You won't solve it by building a wall.
t1_dscqmpx	0	*	Oh no, I'm Australian. I just care about kids welfare, so seeing someone arguing they should be denied resources because of non-sequitors gets a response out of me.     
t1_dsb7nql	0	*	So a wall stops them?  How do you stop people not from Mexico or not getting to the US through Mexico?  
t1_dtxsnip	0	*	It's like arguing with a brick wall.  According to you   > Approx 50% of UK immigrants to Australia (on permanent visas) are returning to the UK  is not a figure.
t1_dtxikln	1	*	What the fuck are you talking about? Sports, language, and food are all things that the UK and India have far more in common than the UK does with Poland.
t1_dswqk5o	0	*	Its one and the same, isn't it?
t1_dswp9as	0	*	Buggered if i know, but you have kind of missed the point. 
t1_dswodb6	1	*	It's the law, in Canada, where I live. 
t1_dswp9iw	0	*	Consider that this headline and clause were specific responses to public outcry against the demonstrations... they won't get funding. Trudeau knows where his bread is buttered.
t1_dswzd30	1	*	Why are you so snobby? 
t1_dswrcws	0	*	Yes. As long as, of course, the women will not die or suffer serious injury due to giving birth.
t1_dswqn27	0	*	So wtf is the government saying they're doing that is discriminatory. That's what I don't understand.
t1_dtak37s	0	*	The intellectual prowess of the American conservative; here on display.
t1_dtc1a21	0	*	I'd like sources for that, because a quick Google search turns up quite a few articles that agree with my view, and none that agrees with yours.
t1_dstqd7k	0	*	But that is presupposing god exists in the capacity you say it does. That's nearly circular logic.
t1_dsjpgjp	0	*	You can continue to put words in my mouth if you want.
t1_du56k8v	0	*	Did you even read the article. It doesn't tell anything if the crime was categorised as far right or not.
t1_dtqm7zd	0	*	missed the whole ussr imploding mr history professor?
t1_ds74y6t	0	*	I'm sorry, but I'm not your father. Though if you ever need fatherly advice, you can turn to me.
t1_dth5hq3	0	*	The ideology is marxist and marxism has resulted in tens of millions of murders over the last 100 years. 
t1_dtnllh1	0	*	I'm only pointing out what they have told me. I assume they know their professions well enough. They clearly disagree with the unions viewpoint. And so do I as the entire thing hinges on a 'could'.
t1_dv4s1cl	1	*	They are both a minority. We are talking about protecting the rights of a group of people. Doesn't matter if they are white, black, men, women, tall or short.
t1_dupeowd	1	*	But if they can, then religion is valid too. Not necessarily institutional religions but the stories and lessons that go with it.
t1_dsv75oz	0	*	But you don't like immigrants, right? Like you don't want anyone from Shithole countries coming to yours, right? 
t1_dszonoz	0	*	What?? No... I'm saying it's possible that he could have secret KKK-style beliefs about race and society.   How is this autistic or tinfoily?
t1_dsjo03q	1	*	I appreciate that, but that was like an overly confident high school PE teacher trying to explain university level physics, and hoping that nobody knew anything about the subject
t1_dsjh1l0	0	*	The Democrat platform has no more social issues than the Republican one. What in the world leads you to think that? 
t1_dsjp2jj	0	*	I dont know, why dont you ask the IRS what they think of their foundation since its been audited many times.    I guess in your purity test for politicians youll never be happy. 
t1_dsmklq2	0	*	So do you write tickets as a part of this thread enforcement gig or is this just a friendly warning?
t1_dsjjk7e	0	*	Jesus, you are anti-democracy?
t1_dsjk9qz	1	*	what about this? what about that? Are you familiar with the term whataboutism because this literally the definition of it.
t1_dt20g7x	1	*	Good luck with everything.
t1_dsr1r2o	0	*	Or at least this is what you think you do.
t1_durb7kx	0	*	Gamers are teh dummies yo.  Smugness dot com told me.

t1_dukpacs	0	*	You will go bankrupt.
t1_dui8r9m	1	*	Yet. The sentence ended in the word yet. Jesus dude. Sometimes it takes a minute to sell a house, particularly during a bubble
t1_dui9clv	0	*	Exactly. If women dropped out of the workforce it would destroy healthcare and all service industries. 
t1_dtsvlnb	1	*	Probably in your own comments?   What's wrong, you're unable to define a word? Did you want help with that?
t1_dujguo0	0	*	devolved

t1_dssa2fq	1	*	This has been an interesting and informative thread. It's a shame it's over.
t1_dttt63s	0	*	An opinion piece from politifact is not evidence that illegal immigrants are not voting.
t1_ds8izcn	0	*	Think about you said in relation to your username, it doesn't make any sense whatsoever.
t1_duetq6v	0	*	Ah yes clearly.
t1_du8uap2	1	*	It is better to not use an outlier to frame the discussion. 
t1_dszv84d	0	*	Again, reread both of my comments.   >I did not state thats his actual view.  read. please read. 
t1_ds4poa3	0	*	lol in other words, you can't answer them without making yourself look like an idiot.
t1_dso3bwo	0	*	Yawnnn.   Your sauce is weak. 
t1_dsny53x	1	*	[Awwwwwwww snap!](https://i.imgur.com/cTy86H2.gif)
t1_dsophl9	0	*	Except it's not the states voting, is it? It's the citizens in those states. Why do their votes count less than citizens in other states?
t1_du4yp4v	0	*	I ask the same to you. I didn't think there would be a day I had to defend Syngman Rhee, but here I am.
t1_dsxb89v	0	*	Sure, but we are talking about overall...we are better than them at far more things than we are worse than them at
t1_dv5wovb	0	*	So your _opinion_ is more important than the law. Gotcha.
t1_dtedcht	1	*	But not occupying, which is the position you were defending.
t1_dt4qxc1	0	*	Ad hominem U0001f44e
t1_ds6chfi	1	*	>  I don't like all of these migrants and think we're better off without them runs the risk of getting you in trouble.  Nobody ever got fined for that.
t1_dtvkb4z	1	*	Thanks for giving me something to research further
t1_dss2rq4	1	*	Man. There's nothing I hate more than a racist. Except maybe a suicide bomber. Those guys are the worst.
t1_dt2zakk	0	*	So you're just going to ignore countries like Finland, Norway, Denmark, and Germany?
t1_dtevxmw	0	*	And now we're in a third discussion topic?  Or are you saying that's why it's okay for Canada to turn them away as well?
t1_dscxd7r	0	*	They have enough reserves to be fine and then recover selling to the markets that exist after carving up the US.
t1_dsd2059	0	*	Fine, then everyone is a troll. You win?
t1_dsc5041	0	*	People never stop learning. And I likewise hope your retreat taught you more about whatabautism and you wont be mindlessly screaming it around :)
t1_dsockwn	0	*	Because YOU LINKED THE ARTICLE!
t1_dv1oh6x	0	*	Reverse racism was made as a way to distinguish between the racism of people that do and don't have power have. It isn't trying to absolve anyone of a crime. It's literally just semantics. 
t1_dv02ttl	1	*	And just because you dont like something doesnt mean its illegal either. 
t1_dv0i5d8	1	*	It's baffling that he actually wrote that. 
t1_dv05gh9	1	*	Lmao, I'm done with you.
t1_duzzgtz	1	*	Really? It's understandable to you to put journalists in jail for nothing?
t1_dv022ry	1	*	Funny how you're criticizing my historical examples while simultaneously advocating for genocide under a thin veneer of native justice.  Which one of us is really flawed here.
t1_dt8r6k0	1	*	Show me. It's simple if you can. 
t1_dt83oq5	0	*	So we will continue to let crimes against humanity happen and your exact attitude will be questioned by future generations 
t1_dt7kcz7	1	*	OH okay, I thought, yeah, that's fine, I don't know what was originally paid, think it's on Wikipedia though, agreement signed in 1897 or something.
t1_dus61qx	0	*	Listen, it's the same as people that fetishize cops as heros. When in reality they clock in and sit in a squad car for 8-16 hours.  I'm an aerospace engineer dude, what are you?
t1_dsvak50	0	*	Nah, you just walked into a really obvious trap.
t1_dt584as	0	*	well his anecdote points something out, sure you could say wages haven't improved very much, but products got cheaper too. What was the buying power of that wage?
t1_ds2z5th	1	*	Now?
t1_ds3fhnn	0	*	... I don't even know how you justify that. It's quantifiably not.
t1_dsh7ntp	0	*	According to 1 side . There are many other cases like this one. This is the first one that showed up in 1 sec of googling
t1_duyp0ky	0	*	Wrong.  Google censors information whether you believe they do or not.
t1_dv0slf2	1	*	If they dont get rid of incapable people or move them around to their strengths then its poorly managed. 
t1_duygfcq	0	*	I'm not dismissing all of climate science, I'm merely trying to point out the need for skepticism, especially in areas where scientists have been notoriously incorrect about their predictions. 
t1_ds260wu	0	*	So now that Trump is in office they should leave NK alone? Just because Trump is trying to make sure they dont dick us around doesn;t mean they are a whipping boy.
t1_ds18mil	1	*	Maybe he's on holiday 
t1_du38580	0	*	Last time I checked, that happened in the 20th century.   Hilarious indeed. 
t1_duygxsc	0	*	Where are you getting the idea that they couldnt do a recount?  
t1_dv37892	0	*	Yeah, let me just go ask the NSA if they'll give me some more details. /s   We can speculate based on probability. Just as we did with the NSA revelations, which turned out to be true. 
t1_dura1ln	0	*	Bye.
t1_dtikb97	0	*	Inaction is action.
t1_ds45091	1	*	Sure, if you want to split hairs. There is a larger point here. I don't know why anybody would focus on Israel in this discussion; the US is clearly the problem.
t1_dtvt2d0	0	*	But how much will that fact *actually matter* in hundreds of years? People, at best, will remember trudeau 2 as that guy who was way too pc. Because this change is so insignificant
t1_dv2surv	0	*	What?
t1_dv4jz6a	0	*	Where did I state them as facts? We are arguing a hypothetical.  You didnt answer my question either.
t1_dtl09dt	1	*	NOWWW!!!! AHHHH 
t1_dtur4mo	0	*	And if you believe that, than you have to apply the same logic in South Africa because the same can be said about what's happening over there..  It's that simple.
t1_dt2ny1e	0	*	You know what? I am definitely going to be a maybe on this.
t1_dt2ptfv	0	*	> stupid cunt.  Says someone who doesn't even understand the 4th grade concept of a scientific theory.
t1_dthkomz	0	*	Weak response.  Thanks for nothing.
t1_dsbpnvj	0	*	Great, I didn't say that.  So go argue with the guy who said that whole fallacy thing.
t1_dsf98zi	1	*	Jesus Christ....no one is arguing it's ok to attack children. But it's completely disingenuous to act like both sides are equal in the regard.  
t1_du25px0	0	*	yet one has power
t1_dtockd6	0	*	Some, but most had an agenda to prove anthropogenic climate change, and ignored everything else.
t1_dugtp5p	1	*	Well said. Once it's political, it's over which is why it feels pointless
t1_dt7t5ak	0	*	Any property or personal crime, from mugging to malicious tresspassing.
t1_dt0lj9q	0	*	I really didn't at all. But at this point I'm just blocking you because you clearly can't have a debate without insulting people at all.
t1_dtbtd00	0	*	Sunk black people in to the worst poverty known and handed the universities over to radicalised feminist fascists.
t1_dtbtq3t	0	*	Yup it'll help distract you from the failing and fake ass president you have.
t1_dsn7qta	0	*	For the less cultured, its a quote from mark twain..  Ever heard of him..
t1_du7q6cu	0	*	I didn't read any of that. 
t1_dspnxfk	0	*	Developed financially, not developed socially. You could say the same for South Africa.
t1_dtmz3up	1	*	As far as I know there isn't 100% proof Jesus even existed as a human. If he did though and you don't believe in Christianity you'd have to assume Joseph or someone else impregnated Mary. 
t1_dtnfhz2	0	*	Yup, you got it for the most part. Also the STANS have high muslim population. That just proves its culture, not religion, that puts women down. 
t1_dsoz8me	0	*	Perfection is a myth pal, honestly, if youd help some one or some country without benefiting from it and knowing that. your a thousand times better than most people
t1_duoowbx	0	*	If guns are less available to the public *gun manufacturers* will stop manufacturing them because there's no profit
t1_duq617v	0	*	Your critiques of armed security in schools have merit, but I still don't see a realistic option with *better* odds. It is imperfect but both possible and with potential to be effective.
t1_dtm0p8z	0	*	Haha. Another excuse. Yeah, that's exactly why you're evacuating, and not that you simply can't hang with the rest of what I said.   Weak!
t1_dtkf8kv	1	*	Again, as long as we were doing hypotheticals, I was excluding nuclear weapons. 
t1_dtlcotp	0	*	Mexico need to seal their boarders,no one out,no one In. Your probably a anchor baby,hehe. All butt hurt. Left nothing but blame games,and handouts. Actually I'm of Japanese decent.
t1_dtihs3t	0	*	Unless you've got very specific accusations you can prove that only deflects the accusation to non-accountable 'everyone'.
t1_dtijl1i	0	*	Ugh. My point was they should be POWs, and it's not up to American lawyers to reclassify them.
t1_dtii6rb	1	*	I wonder why.
t1_dth6xsa	0	*	Then say something bad about Putin?  I'm not defending him it's just funny you didn't really say anything bad about Putin. Here i'l go first. Donald Trump is a bitch and Obama is a cornball. 
t1_ds5b5vd	1	*	Unfortunately. 
t1_ds3twip	0	*	Nice sayings don't settle this matter for you.
t1_du7zgev	1	*	Still replying, just as I thought  
t1_ds8mlyg	0	*	I live on a ranch in the middle of nowhere  Ah, this is why you're so mediocre and out of touch with everything.
t1_dtjhb3q	0	*	Eh reddit is my main source of news so make of that what you will, /r/worldnews is where it's at. All I hear is homeless are fucked by insurance, all you hear is hippy left wing. 
t1_dtjh9rf	0	*	You can stomp your foot all you want, but no sorry 
t1_dtv28rv	0	*	I've seen it, and it doesn't say anything remotely similar to what you're claiming. You must have fallen for some fake news.
t1_du6t8b8	0	*	I don't think Israel as the people are a bunch of mass murders. The government is another thing. I have to deal with this being as an American, so I get it. 
t1_dueu3yw	0	*	you are getting to laughable  I am certain that for salesmen of investments the tax bill is an ecstatic win. Talk about intellectually lazy  Unfortunately for the real economy it is is a disaster
t1_ds1ohap	1	*	...Yes? I'm very aware. And Democrats don't offer any meaningful solutions. Republicans don't even pretend to care.
t1_ds1ld19	0	*	Maybe they are terrorists, because we occupy their country?  Would you not fight the chinese if they invaded the USA?
t1_ds1pla5	0	*	That's exactly what I said, you didn't put any words in my mouth whatsoever.
t1_ds1h705	1	*	Pepperjck love fraggle rock. 
t1_dtqk5bu	0	*	What are you talking about? Racial purist?  Face it, we are all mongrels, friend.  But one thing is little mixing and another entirely is mass invasion that changes everything.
t1_du126e8	1	*	What a pathetic reply, if youre gonna get in debates with someone at least have the balls to see it through
t1_dssraqh	1	*	No u
t1_dv08xg2	0	*	Claiming 'victory' through terms you just invented is ...... well rather sad really.
t1_ds547ie	0	*	haha US an industrial and tech powerhouse? Who would think up something insane like that. It's not like the US has had the highest GDP in the last 200 years. 
t1_ds50mxq	1	*	reported :p
t1_dul4h3l	1	*	How did I not give counterarguments? That is literally the only thing I did in my previous comment.
t1_dstg4cy	0	*	The sentence determines how much time needs to be served. They start getting payments, based on the length of the sentence, once it is handed down.
t1_dtachcf	0	*	You honestly don't realize you weren't just mentioning slavery, you were insulting me?
t1_dta7jqb	0	*	Yup pretty much. A full stop is more honorable
t1_dtchbp9	0	*	Every single country that fell under Soviet Occupation fell to Communism. It's safe to assume they'd do the same thing once they occupied France and friends. 
t1_dtagc1r	0	*	Ok totally with you that this law is crazy.   But dont you mean Germans? What do millenials have to do with this?
t1_dszv3dz	0	*	Your observations are not even anecdotal or statistical. They're blanket statements.
t1_ds1y40c	0	*	The international law is clear. I'm not sure why you're having trouble understanding it but I've lost my patience to argue about it.
t1_duqcu52	0	*	> not at war  > it is not treason  Imagine being this ignorant.
t1_duqjhdt	0	*	Okay, Trump has done nothing wrong. Clinton (sorry, Crooked) should be locked up. You win. Congrats!
t1_duqhg9x	0	*	Everyone still has guns tho  It's not a defacto ban 
t1_duqm9l3	0	*	Oh, he's much better than the guy who was before him. And that's why he's genuinely popular among regular people. Can't say I'm a fan of him, but life under putin is indeed better than in the 1990s  
t1_durvs6m	0	*	Anyone who reported that is responsible. Please address the topic instead of deflecting.
t1_duuidhf	0	*	If there's an industry blog or something that would reflect what you're saying that would be interesting to read

t1_dsq6nnx	0	*	For arguing disingenuously, you are now blocked. Good day.
t1_dss2upe	0	*	When people speak of the opiate epidemic in the USA, that and fentanyl to a much smaller extent is the one they're talking about.   Quit being obtuse.
