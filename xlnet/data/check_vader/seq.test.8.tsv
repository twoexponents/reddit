t1_dutnuj3	-0.340000	*	Let's not go too deep here. We are talking about people who despise elites and also the same people who likely voted for a long island billionaire real estate mogul

t1_dubfp5o	0.000000	*	That's splitting hairs isn't it? It was the DNC. 
t1_dv1gms8	0.000000	*	I don't think you understand. The point is those in power _should not be able to regulate speech_

t1_dur4scg	-0.077200	*	They relocate on their own, also of course not all of them would, just the ones in dire need of help. Its happening all over the middle east, look at what Jordan is doing.

t1_dv1psjg	-0.361200	*	Wisconsonite checking in... we try, we really TRY to vote out these idiots, but sometimes it falls apart. The Scott Walker fiasco was a huge money-waste in the end.
t1_duqr4nt	-0.542300	*	We tried that, remember? They hate being tolerated and non-judged more than anything in the world. They want to be lied to and treated like infants. That's why they voted for Trump.
t1_duylsk6	-0.160300	*	Some people just come off as unlikable.   You don't really need any knowledge of that person to get that vibe.  It may not be justified, but it's a thing.

t1_dufr8s3	0.361200	*	I would say the pirates brought it onto themselves, my only comment is that the Russians should have shown mercy and just shot them instead of sending them to a maritime gulag. 
t1_durenxx	-0.936000	*	> He may lose the Senate but I don't think he'll lose the House.  Other way around. Due to the seat that are up, there's no realistic way that the R's lose the Senate, but they could lose the House.

t1_duwomrb	0.510600	*	The free market in the training of doctors is what lead us to the point where med schools grads average $200k in student loans.

t1_duqbi52	0.000000	*	The Dems aren't cooperating with the GOP on anything right now, either. Both sides have a scorched earth policy.
t1_durslyp	0.025800	*	the german prisonsystem is science based, its backed up by ethics and recidivismrates.   the only thing that the american prisonsystem is based on is just money.

t1_dui9d4r	0.000000	*	That's not how it works. By your logic you'd need to study for a 115 to get 100. How's this work in your head? 
t1_dv4c6sg	0.361200	*	Like some sort of yellow star with the Dutch or German word for Trump written in Hebraic style.  Is that what you are looking for?

t1_dv375o1	0.140600	*	Interesting workaround but it's never been tested in court.  It's possible the government could order a company to leave their warrant canary up, even if they are under investigation.

t1_dupte9q	0.153100	*	Peddling this kind of extrapolation is doing their movement a great disservice. Its no different than any of the other misinformation campaigns going around these days.

t1_dujgmtz	0.726400	*	A larger reservoir in terms of area also equals greater losses from evaporation. If you don't have a lot of water, smaller is better, because the ratio of surface area to volume is more favorable.

t1_dudwvo9	-0.831600	*	The war between North and South Korea never officially ended, but the UN involvement was a police action, not a war, and it has ended.

t1_due1y9x	0.790600	*	You're talking about perfect competition. Which is the case for wheat, milk, eggs, etc. Not the same as the free market.

t1_dv3wjwi	-0.432900	*	Reddit is not strictly American.  How are you going to stop it.  Will similiar sanctions be imposed for America interfering in other countries politics?  Who is going to decide?
t1_dur8w78	0.000000	*	That doesn't make any sense why would the government subsidise everything. Where's the money for it coming from?
t1_dugw575	-0.205700	*	Well when you have that job you basically have to say what the president thinks so it wont exactly go well no matter what if Trump is the person.
t1_duvd7xb	-0.296000	*	I'm very aware of that, however it doesn't mean that they are responsible for everything bad that happens in your country nowadays. 
t1_duush45	-0.526700	*	Such  a substance-free comment.   Journalists in China disappear for criticizing the gov. This doesn't happen in the US 
t1_dv3kmpi	-0.504700	*	Even then we'd still be stuck with two lame ass parties. We need to have instant runoff voting so everyone can pick whoever they want without worrying about the spoiler effect.

t1_dv2pgi3	0.418400	*	Yeah! With all their not being the majority in congress or the senate, and not holding the presidency. Clearly it's their fault!
t1_due1rla	0.469600	*	And there are actually people clapping and cheering for clean coal? Are Americans that dumb?
t1_dusa7wj	-0.354800	*	What if Trump is getting his advice from experts and using his daughter as a messenger? Is that really a big deal? I'm not so sure it matters.

t1_dv2rwwv	0.859100	*	And this is how Trump is president. I hope you find a way to do better next time. Not every candidate is going to be perfect. Can you handle that?
t1_dunxybe	0.000000	*	And more people voted for Hillary. This is how basic math works.

t1_dupq3ht	-0.165500	*	I'm not an expert on the conflict in Sudan, but considering the topic of discussion (race), I'm willing to bet that it's not because they're black. 
t1_ducnr1d	-0.670500	*	If Trump is as sadistic and amoral as most think he is, there's a legit chance he may try to colonize the Middle East if a war starts there.

t1_dv2lm4f	-0.542300	*	He's bad drive sector corrupt, not typical political leader corrupt.  The man's a few bits short of a byte.  A few strips short of a platter.  His checksum doesn't check out.
t1_dudtqdk	-0.401900	*	And that is why health insurance is so expensive in america. Because they have to pay for bullshit like this constantly.
t1_dunaiv7	-0.107600	*	This is the mentality that lead to Trump being president. I'm not saying don't be skeptical, but you're an idiot if you think both parties are even close to the same.
t1_duxsf38	0.077200	*	Got it. Things mean whatever we want them to, depending on our preconceptions. 
t1_duu7jot	0.000000	*	Not for centuries.  
t1_dui3f68	-0.599400	*	$4.36/hr? That would be disastrous.

t1_dv00tkq	0.884900	*	Sounds like in this case white south africans are actually the less powerful party and the black south africans are the more powerful party.  So still doesn't apply.
t1_ducsp4g	-0.102700	*	UK student loans need to be repaid once you start earning over a certain amount annually. This is still a debt as it still needs repaying.

t1_dut04s1	0.510600	*	Authoritarianism does allow it to thrive however. It's close to impossible for the population to demand better working conditions in the current political climate.

t1_dutu5wa	-0.177900	*	So you also consider the Jews who did manage to flee Nazi Germany, abandoned their country when they should have stayed trying to solve the problem at hand.  It's a unique perspective.

t1_dujv06h	0.273200	*	Well at the time of the quote the narrative that meddling was hacking emails and changing votes.  NOW meddling is apparently buying Facebook ads and posting on Twitter.
t1_dunlis8	-0.512200	*	The world is always white when it concerns the US, and always black when it concerns the governments the US doesnt like.  My standard is no double standards.

t1_duaazb6	0.598800	*	Robots dont pay taxes though, the company with robots would need to be ultra efficient and pull in significant tax and foreign money to address Japan's current concerns.
t1_duy905w	-0.051600	*	Ah missed that bit. I wasn't including r&d costs.         Pretty sure they pad the fuck out of that margin too by changing connector each generation and forcing people to debut the same accessories.

t1_dudpt7d	0.000000	*	Actually as long as the purchase is made with currency, in a wage based market economy it's still capitalism. This is just state capitalism.
t1_duqhept	0.000000	*	From them, not trump. If the whole investigation was that tump, himself, colluded with russia (which it is) then it ended up in smoke. You can't charge trump with collusion if he was never part of it

t1_duwuni3	-0.765000	*	It does.   I'm trying to say that the whole student debt crisis is at least in part caused by educational inflation and many people going to a 4-year college when they really didn't need to.

t1_duqgj1o	0.318200	*	Just to expand on the THC part, that would mean if I smoked and it stayed in my system for ~2 weeks after, that Id be considered under the influence for those 2 weeks?

t1_dv4gldg	0.526700	*	Fair. Still, exposure increased the likelihood of it being carried forward I think
t1_duh9yir	0.466000	*	Qualified to know what? What answer? I'm just expressing my opinion here like anyone else is allowed to. What makes you qualified to know the answer?

t1_dv38lah	-0.274100	*	If the foundation of a point being made by someone is incorrect, it doesn't help the rest of the conversation. There's nothing wrong with being human admitting to a mistake and removing it.

t1_dv3mard	-0.273200	*	When did they become a jewish democratic state?  The previous government collapsed because Likud wanted to officially make Israel a Jewish state and the rest of their coalition government didn't.
t1_dukdxpb	0.214400	*	They can help you once you're there, but plenty of people have these kinds of qualities who never come close to a boardroom.
t1_dv538ge	0.000000	*	Caught in a landslide?
t1_dun0g8n	-0.739900	*	Have our police been beacons of how to use guns correctly? I mean for fuck sake do you think a teacher is as qualified as a cop to handle a gun? 
t1_dulbhw1	-0.381800	*	Aw, does public display of emotion make the psychopath uneasy?
t1_durcfbu	0.000000	*	Right I'm talking about the statement of vaccines being a large portion of their GDP not the fact that gates gave them money 
t1_dv1pv4s	0.784500	*	They want experienced people for non-experienced pay, and then they want to treat you like an expense instead of an asset.  
t1_dutzmk5	-0.340000	*	Trump said he could shoot someone and people would vote for him.
t1_duz8360	0.128000	*	We're also only voting on polarized topics. There's never a middle ground or compromise for Voters.  We basically only ever get to vote on Ultimatums: Either you vote yes or no.

t1_dv2owif	-0.102700	*	Please provide source on that, I'm having trouble finding info on this
t1_dufy258	-0.790600	*	This is where youre wrong. Only 15% of people in a plane crash/accident die. https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2017/03/14/if-my-airplane-crashes-what-are-my-chances-of-survival/
t1_duwor86	0.058000	*	Well, he was right about you being salty, if this overreaction of yours is any indication.
t1_dv2aqi9	0.750600	*	Ssst. Too much wisdom and intellect for an average trump voter. 
t1_duibw6c	0.855500	*	It's funny because we, as a society, decide how much Microsoft is worth, and consequently how much he is worth. He earns exactly how much, we deem is fair for the value of his work.
t1_duxh65j	0.849900	*	Look at us making things up on the fly, but we say it confidently, so it's probably true.
t1_duda1dp	0.177900	*	> Weigh the sources of information by their prior trustworthiness.  I hesitate to do even that

t1_duzd5j5	-0.548600	*	Same nationalism is growing in Asian countries. Why is everyone so angry the people next door all of a sudden
t1_dut1s2z	-0.557400	*	Oh shit, that's similar to how we feel right now with the UN
t1_duyszcu	-0.594800	*	Britain colonised South Africa to steal its mineral wealth. There's a history lesson for you. And since it was blatantly stolen from Africans without consent then it should be returned.
t1_durer4o	-0.440400	*	He's just giving the creator's view (which is admittedly much different to your example) there's no need for hostilities.
t1_duh0r1i	-0.250000	*	So your point is it's ok that an entire people's society was destroyed?

t1_dv1nx0f	0.000000	*	Why would you touch your nether regions to a hot stove?
t1_dui7khn	0.436400	*	So you saved apprenticeship salary for like 4 years an then bought a house and car with it...? Either you make insane money or you must have bought a really cheap house.
t1_dv1b5wz	0.831600	*	Freedom of speech implies that you are free to say whatever you want, not that you will not ever face repercussions for what you decide to say. 
t1_duev2p3	0.840200	*	Ahh ok got it. I sure hope we can maintain the balance and see the industry as exploration and expansion rather than an escape.

t1_dv36f2m	-0.476700	*	200 million registered does not mean 200 million voted.  I believe that every mathematician in the world would say you are wrong.
t1_duwd6bs	-0.726900	*	Trust me, we've got shit loads of experience in delivering supplies to remote FOBs in Indian country. Combined with a shit ton of escorting firepower, no one messes with those resupply flights. 
t1_duduwsi	0.238200	*	Which is funny, cause that's the opposite of what should be happening in a society, maybe out in the wild or tribes, but not a civilized society.
t1_dv37sii	0.708800	*	That book is wild ride! I'd suggest it to anybody interested in sci-fi or good books.

t1_dutmj8z	0.437600	*	 That's quite cool!
t1_dunvbku	0.128000	*	He's not constitutionally required to. That's why. Sanctions are a power granted to the executive, not the legislative. That law was not a law but a suggestion.
t1_duwwzql	0.742100	*	A party without contraception is no party.
t1_dugat3g	-0.659700	*	There is and could have been a far darker timeline. Some idiot in office giving everyone a laugh and wasting time is better than putting all that time into war and sabotage.
t1_duo6zfi	0.421500	*	Agree but ten seconds is better than no firearm at all. 
t1_duffizu	0.273200	*	Shouldn't r/politics include communist politics as well, by dint of it's name?   Disclaimer: Am not red.

t1_dudpuxy	0.421500	*	I'm with you, man. Hoping California just napalms the system and goes single payer soon. That'll be the beginning of the change, most likely.
t1_ducje6d	-0.202300	*	And you get charged for holding your baby after.
t1_dugvpn8	0.778800	*	Oh! That's a great idea!!! Why didn't we think of that???
t1_duegryt	-0.939300	*	What a buncha fucks. Poor couple.  What the fuck can you do in that instance? Aside from pulling an imaginary gun  on them and getting her the fuck outa there
t1_dubrot9	0.510600	*	Cant trust anyone these days. 
t1_dv05jyn	0.421500	*	Lol, not my job to educate you, bud. You have the whole internet at your fingertips, so use it.  
t1_duprtwl	0.369100	*	Yeah, I'm not sure where that's coming from. Olympic hockey is huge and Bettman caused massive issues in the league by not taking the two week break.

t1_duvzb1j	-0.526700	*	I work in a liquor store and feel pretty terrible selling to people who clearly have a bad drinking problem
t1_dudrlv1	0.000000	*	If its a specific formulation, you probably can.
t1_dukmc5b	0.000000	*	Or maybe he just appointed a money man to lead and audit the Agency because he felt they spent an exorbitant amount of money in the prior administration. To streamline the EPA per say. 
t1_duxwtss	-0.077200	*	It's almost as if guns are only part of the problem in the US and we need to address other issues as well and nobody in support of gun control has ever suggested otherwise.
t1_dupq5bi	0.361200	*	Angels advocate, thank you for this 
t1_dud2ykx	-0.250000	*	Lowering its budget and moving people around isnt really dismantling the state department. 
t1_dv4f6ha	0.571900	*	So the democrats didn't pick the primary candidate who won the voting by millions of votes? 
t1_dub0n4v	-0.273200	*	As someone who's moved here 12 years ago, that guy is full of shit. It's like 'as a black guy' or 'as a woman' etc, usually followed by something opinionated and non factual.
t1_dv3qyui	-0.051600	*	God forbid that people actually use the voting system provided to them by Reddit right?
t1_dv062qm	0.086900	*	I literally said it may not be fair, read please.

t1_dulezv8	-0.077200	*	Thanks for saying this.  It's a prime example of how little ppl know about the actual laws.  No one can legally buy a gun without a background check under current law.
t1_dujajqg	0.308900	*	It worked for a long time. It's not Atatxfcrks fault that nearly 70 years later the turks elected some idiots?
t1_duj5skx	-0.585900	*	Which is complete bullshit too, the commerce clause has been expanded to 10000x more power than it was ever meant to.
t1_dugkpcn	0.202300	*	Im pretty sure the Republicans were the ones who sold out our country to the Russians.  I think we have a right to be pretty damn pissed.

t1_dugd0m9	0.102700	*	It's super bad, where everyone does it.   What makes you think otherwise?
t1_dv2lhsl	-0.510600	*	At the very least we would have had some sense of normalcy with Clinton, I'd rather have had her than an actual blithering idiot. 
t1_duqvi8x	-0.250000	*	Arabic sand is useless. It is round and too fine. Cant build with it
t1_dus8cre	0.000000	*	See I've tried cultivating constitutions but maybe I'm watering them too much or something because they keep wilting after only a few years. 
t1_dur705w	0.000000	*	-----> the point   ------> your head
t1_dv2kmnf	0.273200	*	Agreed completely.  And I don't think NPR, Twitter users, nor Reddit users for the majority are even aware they're being used and preyed upon by domestic actors with the same methods. 
t1_dui9tib	-0.340000	*	Unfortunately I think you're the only one who made it that far in my comment. 
t1_dusz6jf	0.000000	*	Oh ye. Checkmate
t1_dugkbbb	0.688700	*	Bernie was an independent his whole life, he couldn't expect the DNC to equally favor him. If he wanted more establishment support he should have paid his dues. 
t1_duv74of	0.648800	*	Thanks for looking out, diet is one thing we can't be too careless about!
t1_dui2inx	-0.340000	*	Why are we talking past tense here?
t1_dui94ln	0.646700	*	Deduct 30 from 90 and you get 60. Deduct 30 from 30 and you get 0.  If rich people really hadn't felt the effect they wouldn't have bothered lobbying to get it lowered.

t1_dui9aqz	-0.296000	*	PLus location is everything.  No, I'm not going the normal route of NYC, San Fran, or even cali.  There's plenty of areas in the US where a basic 4/2 house is 250K, and others where it will be 125K.
t1_duootjp	0.000000	*	supposedly around 10-15 years ago the Trump Family was unable to get money from western banks (due to all the bankruptcies) so that's why they had to turn to the Russians.

t1_dv2d4rg	0.275500	*	That's the responsibility of the parents. Who let's their 10-year-old on twitter?  Also, twitter has NSFW filters for sensitive material if I'm not mistaken.

t1_ducoemt	-0.831600	*	And only one side is hell bent on blaming the Russians for everything so......ya.
t1_dudupcy	-0.296000	*	You have no idea. Look at all the brand name products people buy that are literally the same as the off brand stuff. Advertising works, that's why they do it.

t1_duzjrdn	0.340000	*	Isn't Belarus, for the most part, what is left of the old Soviet Union? I mean, they never changed the name of the security service there (it's still KGB).

t1_ducxnwf	0.401900	*	These aren't oligarch's, they are pawns. I can imagine China choosing to extradite if the circumstances benefitted them sufficiently.
t1_dux5wj8	-0.759800	*	WTF, alcohol does the most harm to users and to others than the rest of them. If you spend 30 seconds of your time you can find tons of articles and studies proving this is true.

t1_duzz0gs	-0.557400	*	I think there were two Boer wars, maybe three.  Churchill I think was only present for the final one, so you're getting just a piece of the puzzle.

t1_dujn2b1	-0.541100	*	Nobody dodges bullets and questions like me. Those other Ones were just hacks. Anemic Agent Smith couldnt even kill me when he cloned himself. SAD!
t1_dv4a9mj	0.000000	*	Look up Robert Bork.
t1_ducx7ja	0.258400	*	That is the definition dovetc is using, too. The US govt can't arrest people living in Russia, and Russia won't extradite them.
t1_duai5ms	-0.049800	*	I'll accept your expertise. I know very little about guns, and those pictures do make it look extremely difficult.

t1_dub5vuv	0.296000	*	Ok. That's even if there's a leadership race. If Brown is correct, he's still leader. 
t1_duz5nas	0.296000	*	Yep they do.
t1_dukahas	0.057100	*	You're either a troll, a bot, or aren't following the conversation very much. No one was talking about party platform in this thread
t1_duxrdac	0.401900	*	Yes, they did. Both did. Next.
t1_dv28bwl	-0.599400	*	Thing is, life isn't fallout. People don't survive radiation and become ghouls who live forever. Instead they just die, all of them.
t1_dv0keds	-0.025800	*	well regarding the womens equality, I think Korea is behind the west. Social pressure is enorm esecially for women, which is a reason for the flourishing plastic surgery business

t1_duz33qx	0.510600	*	if nothing else, Bush was also quite willing to make fun of himself at the white house correspondents dinner. Trump just refuses to show up.
t1_dv4q35w	0.000000	*	A lot of cognitive dissonance among the wizarding community, apparently.
t1_dusncz6	0.726900	*	You make it sound like rich people having more input is just. 
t1_dunp6zo	0.000000	*	Read off a teleprompter, read off a note card. But since Trump did the notecard it's an atrocity against America I guess. 
t1_dux0caf	-0.476700	*	Your very first link proves you wrong.     Also, Cristopher Hitchens was a funtioning alcoholic. Find me a functioning crackhead. 
t1_ductfwy	-0.440400	*	Hint: physicscat works for the same consulting places that were targeted for arrests today. They won't have their job to much longer.
t1_dutagso	0.796400	*	the question to me isn't wether Xi is good. the question is how do they make sure that person who follows him is also just as good?

t1_duyufkj	-0.250000	*	Yeah, when guns can actually do damage to the government.  Today you kind of need nukes to do that. I reckon everyone should possess their own nukes. What do you think?

t1_dugg3al	-0.482600	*	Trump isn't going to be the last American president ever. This kind of absolute contempt for our nation is going to last long after Trump is out of office.  I know I'm not going to forget about it.
t1_dv01tw8	0.585900	*	But thats like saying it is acceptable to think Canadians and Americans sound the same. 
t1_dueq9jh	0.307800	*	Dictators don't really bother me, democracy isn't a one size fits all depending on the culture.

t1_duadiqa	0.000000	*	*grabs gimp mask*. YOU BET!
t1_dushg9p	-0.604400	*	This would likely work as diplomatic invincibility does not prevent him from being detained and as mentioned previously environmental damage isn't excluded in these arbitrary rules I've established. 
t1_dujcoie	0.318200	*	A piece of paper? Yeh of course. Cool.
t1_dv399ys	0.700300	*	If you're going to slap a label on someone, it's best for that someone to make the label work on their terms. Self-identification is tongue in cheek at this point.

t1_dv3byhp	-0.031500	*	I couldn't say with authority.  Perhaps it's patriotism---Putin wants this and it's a matter of duty.  Perhaps it's just that they needed a job.

t1_dv21x7g	0.318200	*	I know do you want your elected leaders to put any other countries interests ahead of yours? is a troll's question. So I did respond, just not to that.
t1_dv1q6h4	0.000000	*	You're right. At its core, Trump's suggestion is a decent idea.   But changes need to be implemented *legally*. Nothing should be done without due process. 
t1_dugbgzw	0.421500	*	lol 
t1_duuey3z	0.000000	*	it was cleaned last year... it's being rebuilt... we have the technology

t1_dumu447	0.177900	*	Popular vote has never been the deciding factor though. The Dems cut and ran from rural areas, they ceded the election when they buried Bernie anyway.
t1_dv0yl2i	0.690100	*	lifehacker usually seemed like one of the more respectable sites under gawker.  That said, he isn't just sourcing lifehacker.
t1_duv02xl	0.523200	*	Ad hominem.  Just admit you didn't want to outright lie about your qualifications. Easier.
t1_duhbfwa	-0.440400	*	Not to r/the_Donald though :(
t1_ducgdfo	-0.750600	*	Nah.  Plants are dumber.  Is it ok to kill those?  
t1_dv25rol	-0.775900	*	The United States is one big ass group project so we all suffer whether we're responsible or not. Gotta yell at your group mates to get their shit together.
t1_dv0m0u8	-0.581700	*	First, if you can't explain, you can just say no.   Second, You don't have real freedom of speech, and if you're defending this then you clearly don't understand why free speech is important.
t1_dv02m8p	-0.526700	*	The fact that you think conquest = colonialism shows how little you know of the matter.  Reductionist as fuck.
t1_dv04jsu	0.810500	*	Apologies have been made. Reparations are being made. Treaty re-negotiations in progress. Is it perfect? No. Is there a wide understanding that we must make this right? Yes.

t1_dv0xo0m	-0.807400	*	Holy shit, youre retarded.

t1_dujw8hm	-0.648600	*	And now we have a foreign superpower actively sewing distrust and poisoning the discourse.  
t1_duko2ul	-0.177900	*	Thought it was a comical overreaction at first but...ew.
t1_duovr6k	0.542300	*	Yes it is. This actress is playing Joan of Arc, an actual historical figure. Abraham Lincoln the vampire slayer is not a historical figure.
t1_dv0nh2b	-0.177900	*	The guy who overwhelmingly supported Stop And Frisk might be a poor choice for rights?  Lol
t1_dupmzsh	0.273200	*	Well they're pronounced the same in Bavaria/Austria. Especially Viennese. 
t1_duk0fj3	0.226300	*	Okay and now I guess you're a Russian too
t1_duerufo	-0.144900	*	Yeah the US ostracizing Venezuela as being with the terrorists and assassinating Chavez  probably had no impact on their economy.  LOL
t1_duf20kv	0.000000	*	Yesterday it will.
t1_duovyps	0.778300	*	Me neither man, but who knows. I hear they love cocaine in Hollywood tho. Maybe he meant he was literally smashing 7g rocks?
t1_dulfkdp	0.296000	*	Almost half your country voted for him. Sorry dude, lots of people like him.
t1_duv0n3j	-0.476700	*	This makes me wonder, could he be ashamed of it and the bragging be a coping mechanism?
t1_duo7ism	0.709600	*	If it's a play, it should be accurate. Otherwise, it's not really Joan of Arc. As for the attendees, yes, no one cares because it's just people dressing up in renaissance attire. 
t1_duv4c8b	-0.296000	*	What exactly are you worried about? 
t1_duzzeb3	0.647400	*	Was referring to history but I get what you are saying. Modern civilisation might brake the pattern. I really hope so.

t1_duw7pmc	0.000000	*	It doesn't get much thicker.
t1_duoydf3	0.557400	*	If the movie has an intermission/Charlton Heston and is in color, it's probably fantastic.
t1_dv4vply	-0.612900	*	Where's due process for all the contractors that el naranja idiota decided he didn't want to pay any more and threatened with crippling litigation?
t1_dujeul4	-0.680800	*	When a lot of immigrants pull shit like that people of course become racists.
t1_dvmcaug	-0.526700	*	Guns aren't really commonplace in the Philippines if you're an ordinary citizen. Either you're a police, guard, hunter, or a criminal.
t1_duaay9z	0.877900	*	Some of us are pretty pro-capitalist, left leaning and huge supporters of mass migration.  In fact I generally feel countries that dont support immigration are doing themselves a major disservice.
t1_dug828e	-0.862500	*	I'm sorry but that is ludicrous and delusional. Stop embarrassing the country. 
t1_dv00uj0	0.401900	*	Actually yes, that's what happened with the Kulaks
t1_duljv9j	0.669700	*	Good point. It should always be assumed talking ill of Russia means the government and oligarchs not the people who are quite awesome actually. 
t1_dubiur2	-0.872000	*	>  This Twitter bullshit about Russian bots is an excuse to ban conservatives. Leftist lies and projections.  bro, the center is using this against actual Leftists too. 
t1_duibyuw	-0.226300	*	Who gives a fuck about efficiency? The human is what matters, not the productivity they offer. 
t1_dum6333	-0.051600	*	I love that youre doing this but its not an opinion or anything. They have the numbers and no one fucking votes
t1_duh5t0k	0.000000	*	They had the tiger by the tail and couldn't let go. 
t1_duq4emr	0.000000	*	If only they had bootstraps?
t1_dulrthp	0.077200	*	And you have a great mindset of being a petty, ungrateful person that will always sit and expect to be handed things instead of working yourself up. 
t1_dv2npx0	0.000000	*	My last run was me (Milan), France and Austria in the Catholic league versus literally everyone else in Europe as the protestants. Needless to say, France had 80k in peru
t1_duq0wrz	0.273200	*	Agreed 
t1_dv0223b	-0.796400	*	Holy shit this is bad, bet we'll never hear of it from the leftist media.
t1_duu874e	0.000000	*	That's not what klfta implied he or she meant, either.
t1_duo81x9	-0.599400	*	Heaps of those countries have crushed rebellions, what on earth are you talking about?
t1_dv03dh4	0.308900	*	Why not just use the word thing for everything?   Some things thinged some things. That should cover it.   The fact that you could be more general doesn't mean that being specific isn't a problem.
t1_dv3qpyz	0.699600	*	You glorious man you.  Keep up the good fight!
t1_dubzsja	0.565300	*	Well poster above me isn't wrong either, just different perspective. 
t1_dv2z2tc	0.877800	*	> He said that if Trump won those states, he would win the election  That's not a hard thing to predict. Anyone with basic math ability can work out electoral vote totals.
t1_dufowxt	0.340000	*	We certainly are.xa0Pass me another hunk of co-pilot.
t1_duq8onh	-0.077200	*	I'm agnostic atheist and part of me hopes I'm wrong so that these people do get what is coming to them.
t1_duymxz6	0.526700	*	I haven't heard anything about Russians encouraging the Stein vote. Is that being investigated too or did that already come out?
t1_duadt15	0.000000	*	An AR-15 operates the same as any other semi-automatic hunting rifle.
t1_dv0os33	-0.417800	*	Well said; I have nothing but respect for the Russian people.

t1_dud9gut	0.000000	*	Ayy, Nico!!! 
t1_dv2sbni	0.750600	*	I think this is pretty much as straightforward as it gets with competency spread between the EU and member states. Tariffs are pretty much the quintessential tool in dealing with foreign economies. 
t1_duj0x6t	0.000000	*	To his point, the laws are still on the books. Just unenforcable.
t1_dv5s65f	0.735100	*	As with all political subs during elections lol, mind you I'm not defending them or anything but they used to be pretty decent. 
t1_duj4mxn	-0.785400	*	Don't forget the favorite method of suicide for Russian dissenters. Two bullets to the back of the skull then falling down a staircase.
t1_dv20z7c	0.361200	*	I thinks the U.S. accounts for something like 85% of Canada's steel exports.
t1_durg89f	-0.025800	*	To be fair, you can make statistics say anything.  From my experience, women in Australia dont even bother to report when they get punched in the jaw, it happens so much and nothing is done.   
t1_due2lsl	-0.440400	*	> stop smoking alcohol  This is a weird mental image.
t1_dunvbd3	0.000000	*	Quebec, Canada
t1_due1p8j	-0.510600	*	Our Constitution needs to be re-written. But if we do that it would allow way touch abuse, especially from corporations who, being people, would have undue influence on its writing.
t1_duoaimi	0.000000	*	Absolutely. You aren't getting bluefin by default in the states without specifically ordering it (or doing omakase at a high-end establishment).

t1_duht0hm	0.318200	*	Medicare + Medicaid + VA covers approximately 1/3 of the population. We need to roll these three programs into one, and expand it to everyone, using the economies of scale to keep costs down.
t1_dujllbo	0.476700	*	> an anti-Russian military alliance promoting conflict and US hegemony  Sounds good to me.
t1_duoqakz	0.025800	*	Pretty sure it's closer to this. Or imageboards are fucked 
t1_dv2znoz	0.153100	*	yeah, but at least it wont be Trump because hes going to end up getting the republican nomination again in 2020.
t1_duj1dgw	-0.250000	*	The only valuable works of Russian arts and culture are depressed Russian artists, authors, and playwrights complaining about how much of a shithole Russia is.
t1_dua4caa	0.000000	*	They didn't though. Anyone under 19.5 (currently) couldn't vote in the referendum.

t1_duo4euk	0.526700	*	I'm curious, how much atmospheric dimming do coal plants create?

t1_duhsas1	-0.226300	*	I think you're confusing genetic and hereditary.
t1_dv0pfpk	-0.218700	*	America never a a revolution, the guys in charge before, where in charge after. It wasn't a glorious revolution of the peasant like it is sometimes depicted.
t1_dur75zh	0.000000	*	You're being downvoted because most of these people just read the headline and not the article. You are 100% right.
t1_dv0wckq	0.000000	*	The law can be the law and still be absurd.
t1_dudhtw1	0.000000	*	Not too far off. 
t1_duygfu2	0.883400	*	Hah. The rest of America is united. GOP thinks he accomplished tons, that had to be undone, and sane people admit passing healthcare in America was an absolute amazing thing to have done.
t1_dv27h4v	0.432900	*	Shouldn't we consider factors besides what's cheapest? Like working conditions for the people in these foreign industries? 
t1_duqpzz0	0.421500	*	So did I but I dug a bit deeper and he can offer pardons at the federal levels but they do not override state convictions. 
t1_durf6vu	-0.041800	*	Yeah you have a long time to pay it. I'm not sure what you do if you're away for a long time though, it's never happened to me.
t1_dv1z08r	0.250000	*	No. *Effective* lobbying takes a lot of resources. Like I said, calling your congressman technically counts as lobbying. You raise a fair point though.
t1_dug2j85	0.000000	*	Reading comprehension 
t1_dungieu	0.452200	*	Of course something like an AR needs to be banned.  And likely most types of hand guns.

t1_dujgqp3	-0.584500	*	Similar reasons to why Trump supporters consider a draft dodging idle millionaire to be the epitome of masculinity: he plays the strongman. He's not afraid to say I will fucking DESTROY our enemies.
t1_dv3ah2h	-0.381800	*	I'm not, because Obama's not. That other guy was the upset one.
t1_dutl0in	0.000000	*	It's not about logic, it's about not ruining jokes sarcastic by telling everyone they are jokes.

t1_duqrhzm	-0.629800	*	So what's the response? Riot shields? Water cannons?
t1_dufb8dl	-0.458800	*	How is this downvoted? Its undeniably factual. Getting banned is easier than protesting in North Korea.

t1_dujrbpl	-0.296000	*	I think this is the point that is a show-stopper, it can't be worked out.  No one wants to give up veto power on the use of force.

t1_dukn7ku	-0.381800	*	It was literally 99.04% of Congress in favor of harsher Russian sanctions. Even calling it 95% is downplaying how much everyone agrees we need to give Russia a bloody nose-- except Trump.

t1_dv14zia	-0.680800	*	I agree that overtime /= productive but I wouldn't totally discount that hard work didn't play a role in Korea's economic growth. Korea was one of poorest nation in the 60s.

t1_dum2mu1	-0.883400	*	*Peaceful decline* is practically an oxymoron.  Due to globalisation, we are all linked together now. A catastrophe in one mega economy is a catastrophe for the world.

t1_dusn29e	-0.177900	*	Bingo. The Democrats picking Hillary was a once-in-a-lifetime fuck up to witness. Of all the 7 billion people on the planet they picked the single one that was sleazier than Trump. Boggles the mind.

t1_dv1gwfz	-0.413700	*	Maybe it was just a way to outsource the core of the operation while being able to deny knowledge of any of it?  Distancing themselves from the dirty work while still getting a taste of the profits?

t1_durv1am	-0.518700	*	I believe in a reasonable amount of gun control but to take them away is foolish. I've had cops take up to an hour to show up.

t1_dv01t3h	-0.340000	*	My mistake 
t1_dui2shp	-0.645400	*	Meant to say presidential elections.  Gerrymandering has no effect on whether or not Pence could win an election.  Districts are combined in these elections.

t1_dv2zeut	0.584900	*	Eh, as of recent events, I'd like to give more credit to Trump. He knows exactly what he's doin, and he knows damn well he's driving a wedge between the US and the world.

t1_dv499zy	0.340000	*	Wouldn't they need to run fiber to each tower anyway? So they would have a mix regardless. Giving businesses the choice of getting fiber directly to their premise and mobile internet for light use.

t1_dufp210	-0.433600	*	You realize that it is neutral and more people just disagree with you there?  Neutral doesn't mean you manufacture false centrism remember.

t1_duoazel	0.526700	*	The Democratic Party's political landscape could be littered with Bernies if we bothered to inform ourselves and vote in primaries to nurture honest politicians. It doesn't happen overnight though.  
t1_dugyf2y	0.296000	*	If you watch a few interviews with him you realize that this was his dream position and he was genuinely bummed it had to play out like it did.  I can't bring myself to hate him.

t1_duabohj	-0.497300	*	That's how a democracy works. We go with the most votes. The majority voted to exit the EU and so we should. I don't like it, but I do like democracy.
t1_duv088e	0.868900	*	Good thing your (incorrect) opinion has nothing to do with his award winning show watched by millions.

t1_duq7kx6	-0.296000	*	No they don't. Take a .22 pistol and try taking out a 400 lb hog at 40 yards.   Small firearms aren't even that much cheaper.

t1_dv2o4c3	-0.371600	*	I wrote in Bernie Sanders for President and threw my vote away and don't feel bad. I was heard, even if I was ignored by the corrupt and broken way the system works.
t1_dul3ld1	0.882900	*	If you're trained you can use it somewhat effectively sure but most arent and for the trump administration it looks like a big deal but really is a pretty minor concession to make.  
t1_duovsp2	0.604100	*	He was also holding literal stars in his hand, and had a burning sword emerging from his mouth  It's a somewhat Eldritch metaphorical vision, not an image of him in life
t1_dua9b0j	0.718400	*	Definitely. Russian media barely covers similar incidents. Quick, bland messages, confirmed facts and statements. 5 minutes tops.

t1_dutarvb	0.454900	*	I don't think there was ever a term limit on Sun or Chiang. The KMT was more a dictatorship than CCP nowadays.  So it's definitely less than 50 years.

t1_duz9iyj	-0.189400	*	I'll believe it when I see it. Especially with a state like Texas.  Plus those cities don't have very great public transportation. You will need to rent a car anyway so many people will just drive.
t1_durb3wy	-0.690800	*	I must know then, how effective you do think hungry poor people with guns would be at revolting and who would they kill first?
t1_dum2ab3	-0.848100	*	We define combatants as any male above the age of 14 or something like that. Many of the combatants we killed were actually just civilians in the wrong place at the wrong time.
t1_dusxrrp	-0.381800	*	You don't need to construct your own logic in this instance, the logic already exists.   Claiming to be an adherent of any religious doctrine, is a seriously demanding task.

t1_duqkegw	0.440400	*	I don't think Reagan got away with anything.  I think the guilty party was the former director of the CIA and North took the blame like a good soldier.

t1_dud2tpo	0.000000	*	Tomaat tomaat.
t1_duhtb8a	0.537600	*	I get that not everyone prioritizes lowering NOx as their life goal. But sometimes people actually have to make sacrifices. Most people could drive less or more efficiently than they do.
t1_duwa00l	-0.440400	*	Sick of asshats believing anything anti-Trump no matter how little evidence, sources, and substantiated it is just because they parrot the things asshats like them think.

t1_dv1me49	0.371600	*	The vast majority of the left is not communist. There are a decent number in support of socialist policies on certain things, but that is a massive difference.
t1_dugdy9w	0.636900	*	Definitely. Really kind of makes bear grylls look like a pansy. 
t1_dv5n4yw	0.689200	*	They are awesome! If only VW got into the SUV business a few years earlier!

t1_dv39fz6	-0.947400	*	Yeah those people are dumb but imagine being so upset from losing that you just accuse anyone who disagrees with you of being a Russian shill. That's just as bad if not worse.

t1_duueps7	-0.671100	*	Personally, I don't think it's a good idea to eat any carnivorous or omnivorous species.  Anything that eats meat is liable to have more parasites and pass on nasties.

t1_dv0i6ik	0.801200	*	I was there for 2 years and i agree, most the people there are fucking amazing people! Just the country has no real future when every succesful smart person seems to leave or end up corrupt.
t1_dui6hxr	-0.153100	*	Swing and a miss

t1_duzzqpy	-0.361200	*	The system sucks too
t1_duwmcto	-0.510600	*	That's not how it works. The pedophile gets put in prison and the kids remain with the other spouse.
t1_dued4js	0.000000	*	In Thailand, Russia escorts you!
t1_duuzsyj	0.401900	*	The question is whether a functional addict should still be considered an addict.  And, in my thinking, a venn diagram says yes.
t1_duraumd	0.446600	*	Ah, OK. I didn't realise that was the case.
t1_dushn3h	0.401900	*	Interesting. As a software dev myself, I kind of see that when it comes to economic issues. But (to varying degrees) they almost always lean left when it comes to social issues. 
t1_duui5im	-0.792000	*	> even the elites fall for this trap.  Reminds me of Steve Jobs who didn't go through to do something about the treatable cancer he had, instead he went for a change of diet.

t1_duwa83z	-0.721500	*	Canada really isn't that great. PM is all show. In the end, both countries are still run by corporate shills so it really makes no difference. 
t1_dud2739	0.000000	*	That's rather xenophobic. Bet you have never been to Russia. 
t1_duzzvlu	0.757900	*	fair enough, just compared to trump he got alot of love from the people.
t1_dubqzfe	0.000000	*	It'll probably be a mass extinction event, so if we compare to the previous mass extinctions it will likely amount to 75-95% of all life on earth. 
t1_duv6dg4	0.000000	*	That seems a bit closer to what I'd call an inference, but where does he say that?
t1_dun0qu7	0.190100	*	I personally dont read it as a threat, but regardless your original comment is still incorrect.

t1_dusj5n7	0.296000	*	Yeah I do. 
t1_duk8giz	-0.421500	*	You need to list it on eBay for that amount and once you get a fake bid for that amount you should try donating it using that number as proof.
t1_durnp1y	0.000000	*	I don't think they are more patriotic. They are just showing it off way harder as an overcompensation for being merely a group of state packed together.
t1_duea8hu	0.542300	*	Yeah I'm sure he did it himself. 
t1_dv1vsel	0.890900	*	Because minorities and transgender people can't be blue collar? lmao. Don't try and pretend you care about the working class if you can't care about them as a whole.

t1_dv031po	-0.457600	*	Prostitution is illegal in Thailand, if tolerated.  The attitude doesn't seem ahead of the curve to me in the sense that it values women and their autonomy, it is more indifferent to their feelings.
t1_duj1yfw	0.700300	*	Hope the adorable moron stays safe, may his hats never be crumpled #OnthesamePage

t1_duzwvum	-0.840200	*	Not on the farms, but mass expropriation and talking about killing people makes it sound like this is just a first step. Plus if a famine occurs, it will get even worse.
t1_dupq94e	0.407800	*	back 1940 maybe, police in 95% of german cities that dont have an immigration crisis like duisburg marlox or some parts of berlin dont even carry a gun, from my experience they are not brutal at all

t1_dv34064	-0.734600	*	Probably because that is what got the most rage and attention? They also set up anti Trump rallies.
t1_duy49s3	0.803700	*	No clue why all the down votes but I stand by my comment. This particular branch of comments is friggin hilarious! You're all comedians=jesters=FOOLS (in the comedic sense). Keep going.
t1_duxt6ms	-0.714000	*	I always wear long pants, because, cancer. But I'll fight to the death for your right to wear cargo shorts, but not bicyclist shorts. I draw the line at bicyclist shorts.

t1_dudxf96	0.226300	*	Scratch a libertarian, find a social darwinist.
t1_duxv1zo	0.886900	*	This is the crux. The government is too corrupt to provide security without abuse, but the people are too erratic to provide their own security. Whats a free man to do?

t1_durj7jq	-0.153100	*	No, but thats not point.  Considering guns as rights is outdated, much more when most of the people that have them are completely inept at using them.

t1_duo65y5	-0.319500	*	Things really weren't that much better before Citizens United, tbh. The systemic problems of the American government run much deeper than that.

t1_dulmnsl	0.000000	*	that's not how diplomacy works though.
t1_dua8dng	-0.177900	*	Rejecting a law is not the same as repealing it.  How do MEPs repeal laws that are already in force?  Democracy is not a one-time affair, the ability to change your mind is absolutely necessary.

t1_dud0kpq	-0.394700	*	So do you deny it?
t1_dv4m0rm	-0.802000	*	They didn't see the baby. All they saw was a couple fleeing from the riot location (conveniently the riot footage got edited out).
t1_dupiyc2	0.000000	*	The government's spending money comes from its citizens through tax revenues who would ultimately end up paying for it.

t1_duzry63	-0.502300	*	I know, I saw that too, but i didnt see in any comments of that would fly. The PD said thats ridiculous and the sheriffs said theyll do it. Seems fishy.
t1_dv24868	0.361200	*	Thank you for your input Mr. Sessions. 
t1_duwskz4	0.465900	*	Again, is there a source on this being a valid criticism levied by the person I originally replied to? Long term effects may be a thing but very clearly they were discussing moderate usage 
t1_duwae46	-0.190100	*	Bamboo is a really fast-growing and sustainable material.  If you're going to buy shit you don't need, then bamboo isn't a bad option...
t1_dudumxe	0.064400	*	It's legal in over 50 countries, but I guess they don't count?

t1_dv14se0	0.000000	*	There's been monumental change in the last few generations. If there ever was a time when 'maybe things will be different with the next generation', it's now.
t1_duule0j	0.557400	*	We also dont falsely imprison people and harvest their organs for the rich.
t1_duhi96b	0.000000	*	Voting isn't objective, though. 
t1_duz1re6	-0.240100	*	I think that's most people. If Trump is never brought up on any charges, how many of those who do not support him will think he's innocent?
t1_duiez4q	-0.296000	*	By making another (wrong) assumption, you're apparently attempting to draw me into a conversation to defend myself about statements that **you** make.   There is no debate to be had here. 
t1_duuifri	0.801400	*	You didn't follow the bouncing ball, did you?  Rich dealers *aren't* getting killed.
t1_dux1l4z	0.902200	*	I suppose, if this happens, the only thing we'll be able to do is wait and see how it all plays out. Let's hope it's all for the best :)
t1_duj77pq	0.000000	*	> To quote a recent NYT article:   A quick google linked me to Twitter: https://twitter.com/dpjhodges/status/611943312401002496

t1_dub0n26	0.659700	*	I don't mean every third world country is like that. In large cities things are different. Yes, I agree a lack of education is a big contributor.   
t1_dv3oy9k	0.586800	*	From their dads stash of ammo for the weapon yes.  Most people who keep guns do tend to keep ammo for it as well. Its kinda like owning nails if you have a hammer.

t1_dujktq1	0.251600	*	I'm a little curious myself. 
t1_duk9ziw	0.493900	*	Sure. But if he saved a lot in taxes by writing it off for much more than it was actually worth, thats called tax fraud.
t1_dv45g4i	-0.627600	*	That is business between Russia and Ukraine. Personally I do not want my country to participate in a war in Europe, also EU is already applying sanctions on Russia.
t1_dv0zwoz	-0.700300	*	That's a fucked up metric. We had two superpowers having people from other countries die rather than themselves. Maybe if everyone had nukes, we'd have actual peace.
t1_dv23xuz	0.493900	*	LPT: Colonize the Carribean, Cape Horn and the Spice islands and try to conquer the genoan trade node. You basically own half the world's wealth at that point. 
t1_dv03r6x	-0.709600	*	So until one group decides to forego ethnic nationalism (where other groups may or may not give it up too, and likely have historic grudges), we are stuck in a violent cycle.
t1_duxd6yf	0.792800	*	So what? They seem to love it and don't want democracy so fuckem? Not everyone has the same values as Americans.
t1_duke9ne	-0.585900	*	That was in regards to a budget, and he lied. Multiple budget proposals were presented, and he refused them.

t1_duqarcc	0.468400	*	You would assume, based on nothing, that Trump and the NRA were completely innocent? And what is that based on?
t1_due6xb3	-0.827100	*	Dude read his post history, this guy is a psychopath who claims he'll kill people if his guns are threatened.

t1_dv28ae4	0.361200	*	I really look forward to Trump being gone. Just knowing that eventually he will not be president is something to look forward to. I feel like he's prematurely aging us all.

t1_dua5jq5	0.400500	*	Wasn't that his point, that having a job can much more easily afford you housing in Dunedin vs London where the article is about
t1_dui9vxf	0.226300	*	So do you think billionaires should be paying a lower effective tax rate than a middle class person? 
t1_dur907t	-0.296000	*	It's more about that the ppl who decide about the stuff have no idea of their job
t1_dv2c8uq	0.000000	*	I would say people, not just Americans.

t1_duvcz5g	0.757900	*	Just set it as an observational neural network to observe my ethical choices and act accordingly. Pretty simple stuff.
t1_dv1ko6x	0.000000	*	You asked for a source that MEC is a co-op, and then edited your post after my answer. And now you're being snarky in this response.
t1_dui3e6d	0.000000	*	Do you elect your shop stewards?
t1_dv3y1cz	-0.775800	*	I mean, this particular tariff is meant to do exactly that.  I'm not sure I understand you well.  Are you saying that this tariff will fail ultimately at protecting workers, in spite of its intent?
t1_dv1p0t4	0.680800	*	ehhh... he was only able to play minesweeper and solitaire on it though.  It was pretty much outdated by the time he built it.
t1_dugblth	0.888700	*	I don't know. Its almost like the myth that democrats are just communists disguise is just that, and we're all just Americans trying to do whats best in a free society that is a work in progress.
t1_dufkyvk	-0.476700	*	He is a white nationalist and wants to reduce non white immigration. Indians who dont get that are sad.
t1_ducybpz	-0.340000	*	When a system institutionalizes corruption, almost by design, should we blame corruption itself or that system?

t1_duq1tls	-0.051600	*	People dont really believe this. And if they do, they should be ignored. We still hit some pretty low marks compared to other developing countries though.

t1_dux96e2	0.000000	*	What proof do you have that we only live once? Why can you not be reborn as life again since you are just the universe thinking about itself?
t1_dudp0zu	0.510600	*	Inuk here.   Fun Fact: The Hudson Bay Company, or The HBC is colloquially known as Here Before Christ, since the company got here (Nunavut/Nunavik) before the Missionaries.
t1_dul1d7s	-0.612400	*	According to your logic, jokingly insulting someone's intelligence degrades people with mental illness. Joking about him being gay isn't homophobic at all.

t1_dujy6e1	-0.929400	*	Why are you so bothered by this hypocrisy but not about others in foreign policy?  Should Iran get nukes?  Should China drone enemies on other people's soil?   Should the EU start torturing people?

t1_dut4f85	-0.498000	*	Setting aside Trump for the moment, I'd say that soft power only works when backed up by hard power. That's why despite their many positive attributes nobody ever listens to Sweden or Canada.

t1_dv4rq56	-0.102700	*	What other predator species hunts a population to extinction and doesn't even eat it as a regular part of it's diet. Rhinos seem to do just fine when we leave them alone.

t1_duajoy2	0.025800	*	You lack reading comprehension. /u/Shelnu meant, and I'm sure they can back me up on this:  >Why does it matter if they're Western media, since the news reported here is factual?

t1_dv252yf	0.153100	*	5k retention bonus means nothing if you are losing money on a salary. That's nothing on a 80k salary. Are you serious?

t1_dujzk8t	-0.596500	*	Depends what you mean by masculinity I guess... Maybe what I consider being masculine you consider being hyper masculine. Sure as hell ain't trying to be TERFy so I'm sorry if it came across that way.
t1_dugpwcj	0.571900	*	That doesn't change the fact you have waayyyyyy better chances of nothing happening in a plane.

t1_dugq23t	0.177900	*	And that's a terrible way to force minority representation into a first past the post system. Proportional representation is a better solution to this problem in all respects

t1_dugyx8e	0.000000	*	Apparently not.
t1_duq972n	-0.381800	*	Claiming that Western Europe is currently in chaos is going more than a bit far. The US has political and social problems, and the UK is a joke politics-wise, but the rest is far from 'chaos'.
t1_dv062vr	-0.458800	*	Western thinking does not believe that tribal thinking still exists.  When I asked an Iraqi what he was, he said  Almassi (His family/Tribe/Clan)  Not Iraqui  Think Hatfields and Mocks

t1_duq7pc3	0.612400	*	Lol ok buddy

t1_dv0u3zh	-0.944200	*	I would disagree, people get stuck in their ways because they think they must be right, and everyone else wrong.  I think if we got rid of death it would only get worse, not better.
t1_dug6n0t	0.000000	*	Actually they do. They even got permission to use Saudia Arabia airspace

t1_dv05bln	0.796400	*	Well in the last few hundred years this would be pretty true.  I mean you don't have any modern examples of non-whites invading and taking control of countries to oppress whites.   
t1_duq1gzt	0.000000	*	I've heard it's [a bit moreish](https://youtu.be/tbQIAp2QAUg?t=3s).

t1_dug25ur	-0.690800	*	 Teen drivers are 4x more likely than adults to get into an accident while texting.   I'm guessing it's because they lack experience driving. The statistic is similar when driving drunk as well.

t1_duny2g4	0.458800	*	We do that in the US armed forces as well. You'd be surprised at how many people can slip through the cracks 
t1_dui4shk	0.476700	*	I require too much culture to live in a 3rd tier city. Im sure its a fine place to raise kids if you send them to private school.

t1_dun8me4	0.000000	*	Seems to me if you read any long treatise or political paper, or transcript of military discussion's, Barack Obama is always shortened to BHO, George Bush is GWHB, etc.
t1_dv3rn9c	0.476700	*	omg, i always thought they called themselves pedes because they were proud of being pedophiles.  I just thought it was ped-ophil-es minus the ophil.

t1_dutblqc	-0.735100	*	Honestly, the world is hideously overpopulated and likely approaching an inflection point with regards to the human living standards. Shit is gonna get bad no matter what path we take.

t1_duj4e9g	0.510600	*	At least Russian shills are paid professionals. There are many amateur American shills who bootlick for free.
t1_dua75d2	0.421500	*	Just read both. What  u/bob_2048 said is true.
t1_dui7lqv	-0.827100	*	Clinton left the country with a budget surplus which would have helped pay down the national debt. Bush 2 decided to use it for tax cuts and then started 2 wars, with one being completely unjustified.
t1_dutg6xs	0.000000	*	I believe most of these guys operate out of Moscow or St. Petersburg
t1_dv3l7sl	-0.540000	*	I'm not playing semantics. WWII veterans are not neo nazis, they'd probably be very upset if you said that about them. There is more nuance to the world than you think there is.

t1_dv03df6	0.670500	*	Thank you :)
t1_dulia4d	-0.296000	*	I prove my stance by doing what I said I am doing. Obviously there is no way to prove it to you over reddit.   You obviously dont know what I am thinking.
t1_duumxdd	-0.401900	*	Because nearly everytime someone shouts 'hypocrasy' it's not actually hypocrisy and is actually based on a strawman arguments and stereotypes.

t1_dv3xhfn	0.128000	*	Also worth noting that Moot sold 4chan around the start of all this, and lots of people questioned why anyone would buy it and how they'd make money. Perhaps by selling the site out to troll farms
t1_duyjlrw	-0.340000	*	He'll be itching do resign as the election results start rolling in.
t1_duguba2	0.440400	*	I dunno, maybe if the Republicans could do better than Ted Cruz after 8 years Trump wouldn't have made it out of the primary.
t1_dv0jo74	-0.906700	*	You religious zealot!  &nbsp;  Some? Some?! Basically all modern turbocharged gasoline engines pollute more than modern diesels!  &nbsp;  Diesel ban is one of the biggest hypocrisies of this century!

t1_duo9ksn	-0.481700	*	Look at Australia and Canada and tell me what the problem is if not guns. Yes there have still been the odd shooting in Canada but it's nowhere near the US.

t1_dut15rj	-0.648600	*	I'm aware that they weren't formally instituted but he broke nearly 150 years of tradition and stayed in office until he died. Seems pretty dictatorial to me.

t1_dv2q33c	0.000000	*	Nope. It's a democracy and a republic.  (check the definition of both) 
t1_dv1unhp	-0.458800	*	Oh fo sho. It's awful.  
t1_dv3421q	0.177900	*	So what you're saying is that you misinterpreted my point and that everything else is ad hom appeals to emotion. Sweet discussion, guy. Go have it somewhere else.

t1_duzy1jz	-0.421500	*	Yeah, but you bought 3 months of water by losing the farms.  Either way, these things have a tendency to work themselves out.
t1_dup31df	-0.449700	*	Except the statement wasn't tied to the context of the news event but was presented as axiomatic.  Doing so made it a blanket statement which opened it up for mockery. 
t1_duhvrhs	0.476700	*	They won't read your comment or change their mind.  They are to pot committed to law enforcement being evil to 'peaceful protestors.' Even though they weren't peaceful at all.
t1_dv0rqzc	-0.216800	*	Yeah, seems like all we hear about is the hellish office jobs. What about manual labor jobs, retail, and other out of office jobs? Are they required to overwork too?
t1_dusky3q	0.000000	*	The wall will be thick enough for a dozen mounted USBP agents to ride abreast! It will be seen for miles around, 900 feet at its highest! And we'll finally be separated from the wild lands beyond!

t1_duiejga	0.286900	*	Shareblue? What is that?  Also the clear bias of Breibart simply makes it unreliable a source as a whole. To pretend that it's valid journalism is pure delusion

t1_dukh7e6	0.814400	*	I agree, lets let it run its course and not jump to crazy conclusions like Trump is literally russias puppet. There is no proof to suggest this. If proof comes out I will happily change my mind
t1_duq74mh	0.000000	*	That that accounts for the exponentially larger budget. Maybe 25 % larger because of those issues .

t1_dup3cmp	-0.104500	*	Yeah.  These are wider so I can get a thin cleaner brush in there though. Those curly ones always ended up kinda nasty in my home. 
t1_duumvel	-0.318200	*	Lawyers are technically vultures.

t1_duglkj3	0.750600	*	This is literally like saying well no one's come up with a better creation story so far so Adam and Eve must have been real
t1_dusqdnr	0.250000	*	Yes.  I'd rather the entire world end than a Chinese hegemony emerge.  Take that however you want, but if we don't get to live, you don't either.  So... y'know.  That's the game.

t1_duutgem	0.025800	*	In the US, we also have a lot of silly regulations in many cities that mandate how much space a house must have. This is one major reason that housing is so expensive in Seattle.

t1_duvluoz	-0.960800	*	Clinton was a major scumbag, almost as bad as his buddy neocon Bush. Starting wars, destroying countries, molesting his subordinates at work etc.
t1_duh504u	0.647400	*	Of course, but implying that it was only funded by Clinton is disingenuous. And if the information in it is true, then does who funded its collection really matter? 
t1_duxlv05	0.000000	*	Reading your previous comments, youve been doing the same. Youve been pointing to the backgrounds yourself without addressing that this isnt only a single demographic 
t1_dujgfja	0.361200	*	Which makes it 3 times *less* common than in the US. Thank you for that correction. 
t1_duz4j2n	-0.923100	*	You're victim blaming.  People get raped. Other people rape them. They are equally responsible.
t1_dusomii	-0.916600	*	Since some criminals will hotwire your car to steal it, might as well leave the keys in the ignition so any criminal can steal it, right? 
t1_duzzorf	0.000000	*	I don't think a lot of people in this thread realize that apartheid only ended in 1992. People showing up to vote in South Africa lived through it.

t1_duhlc9m	0.000000	*	You.. don believe in the deep state?  It has nothing to do with trump, its kind of common sense that a group of individuals exist that push an agenda on whoever is in office.
t1_duohu3j	0.657500	*	My point is that there are plenty of good reasons to not want Islam to propagate itself that don't involve hating Muslims.

t1_duqdqpz	0.690800	*	Seems like you would fit that definition better.  Replying to comments with quotes of no relevance to the topic. 
t1_dui1wlz	-0.419900	*	It is ridiculous how often people try to present anarcho-capitalism and Marxism as the only two economic systems that exist (so if you're not for one, you *must* be for the other!).
t1_dv01e30	0.193500	*	If Trump's administration really was white supremacist, they would be doing everything possible to get Boer refugees into the US.

t1_duc9wzt	0.273200	*	Well, then it would be negligent to not have the trigger covered by the holster.  Edit:  Seems every glock holster google images kicks up has the trigger guarded.  
t1_dujdvkd	0.000000	*	The plural of Moose is Moose
t1_duz24lv	0.636100	*	I think so, yeah.  For some reason, completely unbeknownst to me, he did have support from the general population of republicans. 
t1_duzjj2d	0.492600	*	I hope you are right! 
t1_duj54if	0.000000	*	See, you don't actually know that, so basically this is a shitpost

t1_dunkegt	-0.612900	*	Here we go... Guessing you're from a country that doesn't have real free speech, and would rather insult people than admit that American free speech is better than whatever country you're from.
t1_duwp4qj	0.457600	*	Check the OP... It does mention Quxe9bec very clearly. .. The US has nothing to do with my comment...

t1_dugsu62	-0.836000	*	Thats not what I am talking about at all. There is a huggge jump between a visa scheme and citizenship.   And Trump is an idiot. (No way in hell am I a Trump supporter)
t1_dulmrfi	-0.340000	*	Yeah cause trying to diffuse a nuclear stalemate with an aggressor is similar to meeting a burgeoning dictator that is no threat to the United States.  
t1_duewzm9	0.303400	*	Are you fucking kidding me? This is warped beyond reason. The advancing of mankind? What ideology have you been smoking?
t1_duufza3	-0.801700	*	Yes, you're the only one here thinking that democracy in general is worse than corrupt politicians in China attempting to seize power for life.  Democracy is bad isn't a great position.
t1_duld3yj	-0.784500	*	[Diyu is a purgatory that serves to punish and renew spirits in preparation for reincarnation.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diyu) So everyone goes to hell, and there is no heaven.
t1_dv3ngye	-0.361200	*	Those people can all exercise their rights individually. Right now, they're getting representation as individuals and as a corporation, which is ridiculous. 
t1_duidoj6	0.000000	*	Nightmare mode: the millionaires and billionaires don't buy politicians,they become them
t1_duj698n	0.432000	*	and something doesn't become less bullshit just because there's a bigger pile somewhere else.
t1_dv39b4f	0.843900	*	That's a fantastic analogy, I love it!
t1_durye8j	0.750000	*	I was wrong... better take a wild guess about this guy's weight to save face!  What world does that actually work in? Real question.

t1_dv26usa	-0.226300	*	To act like a jackass, make the news, be talked about and have his bloated ego filled with any attention, good or bad, that we give him. Tell me I'm not the only one that believes this. 
t1_dusi0fs	-0.318200	*	You really think any country will want to do business with someone that threatens military action if you don't do what they say?
t1_dupl25c	0.000000	*	Absolutely

t1_duysu8m	-0.197400	*	See, those are the Republican values I can actually work with or debate. The modern GOP is none of that. Glad you learned that lesson early, before the propaganda machine consumed you too.
t1_duxok7l	0.077200	*	Oh yeah, it's there alright :(
t1_dupjyeq	0.000000	*	I wonder how the cost of renewables compare to the price of coal at the moment. 2x? 20x?   
t1_dv3kdky	0.726900	*	I always just assumed they were calling themselves pedos like their hero Donald
t1_duand02	0.647800	*	I really want /u/sooperdavid to doodle the Yooper Scooper, then a small part of the universe would be happy. 
t1_dux7qw8	0.000000	*	> the working class in cities.   You mean most people?

t1_duq38o6	0.000000	*	How about Poland?
t1_dur8oe7	0.790600	*	Hahaha you actually believe that  spoiler alert: no, that number probably includes people you consider close friends.
t1_dulnx5y	-0.225900	*	Well, votes weren't compromised is not the same as votes weren't influenced. Trump won PA, WI, and Michigan by less than a point. You're telling me that the Russians couldn't swing 100k votes? 
t1_dudo3is	-0.102700	*	Because its exclusive. Whenever you exclude something youre dividing it by definition. 
t1_dui9xn8	0.000000	*	The Arabs were more in North Africa  Ever wondered why people in North Africa are Arab, whilst everyone else in Africa are black?   That's because the Arabs wiped out the native black population. 
t1_dupnpvl	-0.168100	*	this was not meant seriously.  looks like i need to edit that post, because people tend to take the most obviously stupid things for real.
t1_dud318z	-0.678800	*	You're not cute.  You're just sad.
t1_dugtt4a	0.000000	*	And that violates free speech. It's literally saying You make above X amount of money, you're not allowed to write to your Congressman
t1_dupl5y8	0.812200	*	You're welcome. Keep being awesome!
t1_dv4k4cl	-0.115400	*	Nice red herring but it's besides the point and no one argued that, the fact that you do now distinguish between the two is progress. 
t1_ducwpv6	0.421500	*	Nice refutation, bud. /s
t1_dv0vriu	-0.451900	*	True, but one of those consequences in the US that you won't be charged with a crime.
t1_duhzkyy	0.765500	*	Good, I don't want to argue with someone more interested in tone policing than actually engaging the argument. Bye.

t1_dundmh3	0.000000	*	Nope. 
t1_dunm7rt	-0.688400	*	You read the worse crap ever. At least start with Wikipedia which is peer reviewed (and countertrolled!). The Austrian School is just proFascist Economics! Be a Serf, be a Libertarian!

t1_duou2cx	0.000000	*	The Bugatti exists as a production model. The Buran does not, and never did.
t1_duyrb7q	-0.953800	*	It's only scary if the people want him dead without proof of being a traitor. If they are proved to be traitors to the country, the death penalty is not scary, it's appropriate. 
t1_dv00irn	0.000000	*	So your saying you cant actually provide proof it exists. Got it. 
t1_dv16tf7	0.636900	*	> Probably the best track record in this century though  We really have about 25 more years before that is the case.

t1_duj5sxy	0.440400	*	Funny, thats exactly how I see the US. 
t1_dv3a4po	-0.296000	*	No, he already decried the whataboutism once. Your type just keeps at it though.
t1_dv1t1fx	0.000000	*	You're right.  We're gonna need to put an island, on a smaller island and let it get gigantic first.
t1_dualxlt	0.421500	*	Easier to see than a hole in the road, especially at night.
t1_duvgdqo	0.000000	*	I realize now I should have cleaned that up  
t1_dud9wca	0.051600	*	Things i did not expect to read today: Someone from the LOCK HER UP party unironically criticizing people for jumping to conclusions before the investigation is complete.  
t1_dv1yekr	-0.308900	*	Because he doesn't have any values, he just says whatever pops into his head.

t1_duz5dbg	-0.296000	*	spinning a fact means its no longer a fact.
t1_dv2kksl	0.421500	*	Also probably true. 
t1_dud5j23	-0.865300	*	My point is, we have to recognise that this is widespread and not exclusive to one particular candidate.  To just use it as an excuse to say FUCK DRUMPF!! is ignorant and misleading. 
t1_dv0fyy1	0.358100	*	OK but since then your technology hasn't improved at 1/1000th of the rate of the military. You have better rifles and they have drones, tanks, airplanes, missiles, and all sorts of tactical gear. 
t1_duijujt	0.654200	*	That's tough, but far from typical. You did adopt 2 special needs kids? 
t1_dv651ls	-0.128000	*	Lol because we were there for 10000 years idiot

t1_dupox7k	-0.879300	*	To be fair, the Russians who taught me this were fat, but damn could they drink. The 5 of us killed 6 bottles that night.
t1_dusjd6k	0.505800	*	Not with that attitude, it won't. What if you believe really hard, looking better already? Believe some more, and have two scoops of ice cream, now everything is fine.
t1_duxp8xh	-0.584800	*	> But it should be doing that anyway.  Exactly! If they had the ability to drum up $8b through cuts or increases, then they WOULD have done that. An $8b loss is still an $8b loss.

t1_dudfhbb	0.000000	*	Right, so you think it's reasonable to think the world is flat when it was disproven several millenia ago?

t1_dulc9ff	0.000000	*	Or just not running as many hydro generators.  Why use solar and wind to pump water up a hill when you could just use it to supply the load at the time and run the hydro generators less?

t1_duulyap	0.397100	*	It isn't a threat.  The only country pointing nukes at anybody is North Korea.  A lot of superpowers have nukes, and it's only a deterrent because everybody knows how powerful those weapons are.  
t1_duzz2wu	0.612400	*	Im not saying the process is good or works well - just that they should follow the process regardless of race.
t1_dultoo2	0.000000	*	So, if Nigeria asked France they would go? If Eritrea? If Mongolia asked France to come, France va?

t1_dud8oj1	0.000000	*	I think he meant it as he spelled it. Sewing onto the fabric of america, division. Attaching it via a thread, as it were. 
t1_duzfyva	0.599400	*	China is rising as a super power and filling the void left by the Soviets in 1991. The closer they get to equal footing with the US, the more client states will make the switch.
t1_duaqxr4	-0.577500	*	So you *are* admitting that Capitalism in the US is as bad as North Korea? Or do you want to rephrase that??

t1_durfynk	-0.784500	*	Japan has a selective memory of WWII. The down-playing of Japanese atrocities in Asia, within Japan, is one reason for continued bad feeling between Japan and the countries it invaded during the war.

t1_dv4guaj	-0.806800	*	You nailed it, another gang will definitely scoop him up, but ISIS? I highly doubt it. Either way though, he's still going to have a bad time. He's very young and soft.

t1_duxvhgy	0.585900	*	Lovely thought there.
t1_dupo633	0.197400	*	Thanks for some explanation without attacking. I find some Reddit users to be quick to anger and defensive attitudes.

t1_dukc0qb	-0.557400	*	Curiously, that's also around the same time he first visited russia. And then when he came back, he took out a full page ad in the NYT newspaper against NATO.  Why would he give a shit about NATO?

t1_duymf0z	-0.611300	*	Its more than that. All you mentioned is just icing on the cake.   Dropping sanctions (aka adoptions) in the name of fighting ISIS together is the main reason why the Russians wanted Trump so badly.

t1_dub29c4	0.000000	*	Chode? That is not even a word and you appeal someone's talking. I would say you are a troll (not a paid one, though).

t1_duq750m	-0.341500	*	No, chaos is probably too strong a word. More like they took a dump and we have to just deal with having their steaming turd be omnipresent for 4 years.

t1_dufyro2	-0.708200	*	I would argue it's more a case of it not being a problem that a dog will occasionally shit or piss in your house.  It's something that happens when you buy a dog.

t1_duzzc5u	-0.179600	*	It is true, and what I was referring to. Whites did what these other African tribes also did. Maybe even less violently, difference is they built a country. 
t1_dundum6	-0.510600	*	U actually failed 
t1_dv0dbcb	0.025800	*	You do realize that the reason refugees could reach Germany and Sweden is because the Dublin Regulation was put out of practice?

t1_duynbqm	0.586200	*	I've been using /s on a lot of comments the past year, because you can't say something dumb enough for people to know it's sarcasm.  /r might be the next step. It's short for fuckit who cares.

t1_dv51ncq	0.504000	*	That doesn't make this one instantly real though. Usually an anonymous source can point to evidence that actually exists instead of relying on only their word? What good is their word?

t1_dv1pevk	0.754900	*	I'm not replying to any of these responses because people are dumb... but I will reply to this, because civil forfeiture is so awesome! I have no idea how that it's even close to constitutional.
t1_dunye1d	-0.884700	*	No...Trump speaks in big terms on nearly everything he is working on. He is simply positioning and promoting, but some people ignorantly mistake that for lying.

t1_dupt73x	-0.655200	*	So why lie? One of the weirdest things about Trump's Cult is that they seem so eager to give a select group the benefit of the doubt. If a dirty librul did the same they'd be losing their damn minds.

t1_dv3dd9y	0.000000	*	I just thought they were a bunch of pedoes.
t1_duzdowb	-0.401900	*	This is the problem. More streets automatically lead to more car usage. This is why every city that build up their streets always had even more clogged streets a few years later.
t1_duu2jhl	0.318200	*	> My point is that to call China imperialistic is a tenuous allegation  Actively invading, subjugating and vassalizing your neighbors is imperialistic. Imperialism isn't just invading far away places.

t1_duksxop	0.571900	*	It literally says in the Flynn and Papadopolous plea agreements that their sentencing is to be determined, based on how well they cooperate. Sorry, Trump's underlings are singing. 
t1_duaqi4e	-0.476700	*	Institutions are made of individuals. Corruption and exploitation affecting universal healthcare hurts all taxpayers, and the system itself.
t1_dur5894	-0.900400	*	I see the trolls aren't even going to pretend that they're American anymore.  Just going to write in English so shit that even the dumbest Americans would have trouble copying.
t1_dv34lpv	0.822500	*	Sounds like a pretty good way to go.
t1_dupwwez	-0.332700	*	By the legal definition, you're probably right.  But is that what we're going for in MeToo?  If so, I suspect nothing will really change...

t1_duhsuo7	0.340000	*	Nope. Correct on Puerto Rico.  They are a colony of the United States. They pay billions in taxes per year. They don't get to vote.  There's a term for that: Taxation without representation.

t1_dugrokr	-0.153100	*	You're acting like all of the large cities are a homogenous population of Democrats, which it isn't. It's just as wrong as assuming red States are homogenously Republican.

t1_duwi6ax	0.401900	*	In developed countries yes. This is also something an individual can do, not a whole society, so I don't get how these two ideas are even comparable.

t1_duhwnem	-0.202300	*	I mean, if we did that, Russia and Iran would quickly consolidate power in the ME, and that would be a bad outcome for the world.  Maybe it's still worth it, but that cost is high.

t1_dv4zktz	-0.130600	*	And they were Republican-led investigations, too, so it's not exactly like anyone can claim the people investigating her and ultimately being unable to nab her on anything were biased in her favor.

t1_dusn11r	-0.119500	*	Using ears to local the shooters lmao how are you so stupid ? 
t1_dubn4cu	-0.400500	*	Russia sanctions, voting reform, cyber security instead of fucking bullshit payouts to the millitary-industrial complex, etc. Of course a republican congress puts a damper on things.

t1_dv3jyli	0.475400	*	Hardly. Hillary's coverage didn't get much more favorable after the primary, it's just that there was a new target in Donald Trump. Even the Bernie or Busters could appreciate attacking him.

t1_dutv4ze	-0.318200	*	> predictions are exaggerated like the one that said there would be no land ice left by 2016.  Stop making things up  
t1_duaid58	0.027600	*	hmm it's almost like when you start a conversation with a low effort jab at a country of 335 million people nobody really wants to talk to you anymore. Go figure. 
t1_dur09fv	0.571900	*	I think you won
t1_dui7rf5	0.000000	*	Are you a doctor or a teacher?

t1_duqoglo	-0.476700	*	You may be right, I was not aware of some of them being suspended. 
t1_dv442zm	0.153100	*	Yeah but I wonder what you have to say about the topic of the actual conversation.

t1_dv56v7k	0.000000	*	I was making a joke about Nazis vs regular people. No idea where you got Russians from
t1_dugvzye	-0.493900	*	When will the pech drop, when will the pech drop?
t1_dupkec2	0.440400	*	Fib in English has a lighthearted connotation. A white lie or harmless joke.   Lxfcgen means to deliberately falsify/fabricate. Now famously made known by the term lxfcgenpresse, fake news.  
t1_dv0ma70	-0.680800	*	> unappropiate   You said unappropriate. No wonder you would have such a stupid view on this subject. 
t1_dudxfun	0.000000	*	Which data? 
t1_duontts	-0.051600	*	Lol Im severely underweight at 14 bmi. I could use some fat.
t1_dulu5h5	-0.102700	*	I used to live in Germany and my family roots are there. Im curious if from your perspective you think Merkel has gone too far or if Germany has a handle on the migrant problems.
t1_dv31n1m	0.571900	*	 But I also want to keep my rivals from also getting more money, doesn't more trade power in a node make them richer also?
t1_dv30a7f	0.745600	*	lol yea one organization out of hundreds. LOL. Every year I will vote against whatever the media wants me to vote for
t1_dv4b117	-0.599400	*	Gravity is a molten ball of metal pulling us towards our death

t1_duetw8v	0.000000	*	And Scotland.  Tea time, dinner and supper. I know they are all technically different but we use all three interchangeably.
t1_duq3xxl	-0.680000	*	Classic scapegoat situation. Just like the financial crisis in 2008! 
t1_duxboly	-0.680800	*	one day she's going to do that to a Russia Mafia guy, and she's going to end up raped by a horse
t1_dugbt10	-0.128000	*	Lots of people like to support rogue terrorist states. Your point? 
t1_dv17iiq	0.318200	*	fair enough
t1_duqv004	-0.528300	*	Obstruction? It's not like they need a formal request. I believe a few people have already moved to impeach. They've just obviously been ignored.
t1_dunbmlf	-0.361200	*	you just got bamboozled by Maskirovka
t1_dup3l17	0.361200	*	IT'S LIKE RAAAAAAHIAAAAAAAAIN

t1_dufgof4	-0.700300	*	They're fucking everywhere round my joint. Dumb as dog shit as well - have to drive at 20 km/h coz they jum out in front of the car all the time.
t1_dulb6tu	0.669400	*	One that used to cherish democracy, but is now more like a banana republic?
t1_dua61vo	-0.542300	*	Blatantly wrong. If you go to a gun show any of the dealers will hand you a background check sheet. Refuse this and you will not be taking any firearms home.
t1_dunk0fl	0.493900	*	How can you tell someones religion from seeing them drink a coke or sit laughing at a table exactly?  But you didn't answer that.
t1_dupiwnn	0.250000	*	After they passed 'No HealthCare/Health Insurance Provider Left Behind' Big Medicine pretty much has it sewn up.

t1_dv065cn	-0.570900	*	It was incredibly stupid if he did it 
t1_dupecug	-0.542300	*	He doesn't actually know how the EU works and is too much of a lazy fuck to try change it (unlike other countries like Romania that have ACTUALLY TRIED to put this case to the EU courts).  
t1_duut9t4	0.446600	*	You OK?  Because none of that made sense.  
t1_dup2mg7	0.746900	*	Well in Antwerp you can get it pretty pure, but then again Antwerp is called the capital of coke in Europe lol
t1_durfcuq	-0.421500	*	Hamburg was a disaster scenario in the original sim city
t1_dv2umjr	0.000000	*	He doesn't understand trade deficits. Does he not have an economic team to explain things to him?
t1_dujr53j	0.831600	*	Yeah, free education, free healthcare. Very repulsive.

t1_dv05gwy	0.500600	*	Joburg central is terrible, but thats just a small part of the metro, theres plenty very safe places in joburg too, but its just a city , wouldn't call it a tourist destination
t1_dugdysz	-0.717800	*	Your uneasyness is completely ridiculous.  It has no base in reality.  If you understood the chances, you should be shitting your pants every time you get in a car.

t1_dur3yax	-0.778300	*	In order to drain the swamp you must become it. Then get it arrested and charged for treason.
t1_dumc4w7	0.636900	*	You're being pedantic. It's a perfectly relevant discussion considering what came before.
t1_dudc6ur	0.421500	*	Yet.  And maybe it won't be. But it is premature to say that today's indictment is the end of the investigation and that Trump was vindicated.
t1_dutg79f	0.000000	*	Not any moreso than it was already going to.   Their protection from being absorbed ran out years ago and their becoming of a de facto state of China was a sealed fate. 
t1_dus7ahc	0.177900	*	When I was growing up a yard glass was a typical 21st present.

t1_duwr87g	0.000000	*	My apologies. I was referring to the U.S. I stand corrected.
t1_dua5rr5	-0.421500	*	I think that's what \u\zahrul3 was saying, that London is the place where housing prices are ridiculously high and jobs don't imply you have enough to pay rent/eat.
t1_dur93k3	0.000000	*	not obama
t1_duqqfml	0.000000	*	> He's trying.  Inb4, But true/real communism has never really been tried yet! /s
t1_dv2gvt6	0.273200	*	If you accept something to be true without researching it to ascertain whether it is or not, you're an indefensible idiot.
t1_dusuuvw	0.510600	*	That's... Actually impressive how you bend that one. 
t1_dud0q7q	-0.843200	*	So let me get this straight, another country is shedding light on the voting fraud made by the DNC and we are mad at it. Why not be mad at the DNC for rigging elections?
t1_dunxkk4	0.421500	*	It is much easier to vote than to own a gun... What on Earth gave you that idea?
t1_duqoia6	-0.226300	*	Terrifying; true 
t1_dv1tfx3	-0.716500	*	I was going to guess coal mine. I don't think he could stand working around so many terrorist illegals at 7-11.
t1_dujp1qp	0.258400	*	you probably mean the pension rights of those same millenials, we wouldn't want to piss off the largest demografic of voters, would we?
t1_durjizg	-0.070000	*	I am not responsible for crimes I did not commit. So I'll thank you to leave me out of your rampant generalizations.
t1_duk8bep	0.520000	*	Well, that's not *his* fault.
t1_duw1z5l	0.469600	*	Why are you alienating southerners?  How does that help America?
t1_duzzqdf	0.361200	*	I have a question. What is the general education like in south africa?
t1_dv4rww7	-0.296000	*	No they're not. Did you even read the study? 
t1_dv03sa7	0.510600	*	Well yeah that's what I was saying. You're just looking for excuses to zoop aren't you?
t1_dv05ndw	-0.468000	*	And even if they were alive and willing to go back to their farm it probably won't help. Odds are that most of the equipment will have been sold off for scrap or be in very poor condition. 
t1_duifw4q	0.361200	*	I feel like they did it just to partially recoup the cost of sending students to universities. Though given the extortionate price hikes they've been allowing...
t1_duz3x7h	0.000000	*	Socialism is not government ownership of business or control over economics, by that rationale every government that has ever existed is socialist.
t1_duut44e	0.000000	*	It's may not be proof. But it is evidence.
t1_dv04w21	0.381800	*	They already exist. Germany has several economic incentives for childbirth. People dont want to have children. 
t1_dv4165f	0.226300	*	My account is 3 days old. I'm not a regular anywhere. Get your facts straight, mate. 
t1_duioxjc	-0.773900	*	FFS no one here puts shrimp on a barbie. Snags, onions and patties only.

t1_dudxrfs	0.000000	*	We, as in everyone who reads what you said knows what you're inferring
t1_durbd0e	0.945500	*	I understand, but surely there is better currency to be bought? I mean even dollars should be a fine choice. Unless the government is giving some artificial advantages I'm not aware of I guess.

t1_duqy32u	0.000000	*	Bro, do you even Latin?
t1_dui9l41	0.510600	*	Absolutely.  He was brought up in essentially an upper middle class family.  Far closer to 'poverty' than a someone raised with a trust fund and a billion or so headed their way from a relative.
t1_dunutik	0.296000	*	Yeah
t1_dubp2q7	0.421500	*	He can pass sanctions that were already approved by Congress and Senate tho.
t1_dv0hgo2	0.000000	*	*ahem*   What do you mean by the soviet union being right wing? Isn't socialism left wing innately?

t1_dv34o4y	0.790600	*	Do you happen to know if there's a new sub for stuff like that? I used to love jumping head first in a rabbit hole. I want to Believe.
t1_duq9mi2	0.273200	*	Yeah. And...  I feel like Im having a battle of wits with an unarmed opponent. 
t1_duq4yvd	-0.690800	*	That's not taking everyone's guns champ. But anyways, I can't fucking *wait* to vote for gun regulations. Gun cultists are sick in the head, obsessed with an object. 
t1_duynjz5	0.680800	*	Lol if anyone runs for state wide office in the Northeast as a Team Trump politician theyd be lucky if they even got on the ballot. 
t1_dud9gn2	-0.571900	*	>Your argument was that the Netherlands had no moral standing to be a speaking voice in the discussion on the armenian genocide,   Where did i do that?

t1_durgphw	0.637700	*	The United States didn't sell chemical weapons to him.
t1_duv0w1d	0.000000	*	We could round it to the nearest 1000!
t1_duqywcu	-0.733400	*	Your comment seemed to be attacking George Clooney. If you had just explained it as you did up there, maybe you wouldn't have received so much criticism. 
t1_dulyxgh	0.812800	*	I'm not angry.  I'm precise.  I'm emphatic.   If you read my posts as angry, that's on you, mate.  :)
t1_dumh8zy	0.624900	*	That's a great way to put it
t1_duuuqsr	0.000000	*	Mugabe though. He even outlived his own nearly 50 year rule.
t1_duv7m53	0.186700	*	I'm sure that right now, in the US, a journalist can criticize the GOP without significant fear that they'll be black bagged.  
t1_dusifj7	0.862200	*	Oh yeah, teenagers love Trump and mine craft. Thanks for the reminder! 
t1_dupl8zh	-0.817600	*	And Communism is based on industrial mass murder of millions of innocents.  Maybe human nature is just violent.
t1_duomltn	-0.877900	*	No he's saying you are a nut who fucks, or a fuck who nuts. I don't know.
t1_duh2hq5	0.000000	*	Mother's recipe.
t1_dutrdvj	-0.636900	*	You can try to change things without taking it personally and being sad about shit like this.
t1_due66so	0.359700	*	The problem is the very richest are getting a much bigger cut, and when this bill trashes the US economy and it's harder for everybody an extra $70 a check seems like a silly trade off. 
t1_dv3skdv	0.000000	*	Hebrew is a Semitic language (related to Arabic) but Yiddish is related to German...
t1_duk8rme	0.000000	*	**Let there be bold**
t1_dujhizo	-0.840200	*	Of course, but we already know that. If the point is to prove to non believers, placing anything which gives them doubt is a bad idea. 
t1_dv1ctfs	-0.126000	*	No idea! Must be chance, I can't think of any history they have together that would have developed a similar accent.
t1_dusogkn	0.556300	*	What if we just use one really strong laser? 
t1_duic3hb	0.000000	*	A lot of those assholes could use a good roll, not that I would know anything that kind of thing ;)

t1_duwtqta	0.812600	*	Yeah that's fine and I agree now.  But that's not what you said at all before you edited your statement then down voted me.  Stay classy.
t1_dulfkfc	0.476700	*	Ok cool thanks dick
t1_dv2s8sw	0.542300	*	And that's why I like you Americans.  Individually you're great, I get that it's your system that's broken not you.
t1_dv0ykt5	0.000000	*	Since when? The people who were born in post-dictatorship Korea have only recently entered the work force.
t1_dugtf0v	0.128000	*	the point is, calling them Top U.S. Official sounds serious to the masses, whereas naming the particular democrat senator that's calling them out isn't news at all.
t1_dulmrw2	0.910200	*	Well France surely isn't doing it out of the goodness of their own hearts that's for sure. No country gets involved militarily unless it is to protect interests, whatever they may be. Don't be naive.
t1_dv09a2c	0.000000	*	Sooo, Chicago then?
t1_dua8e0g	0.492700	*	As a European I find it very funny that you think reddit is left leaning. Using American measurements basically the whole world is left leaning.

t1_durpt7q	0.000000	*	... he was neutered ?
t1_dusmyl5	-0.841300	*	Tariffs is tax on the poor and crony producers keep the proceeds. Lobbyists take a cut too higher costs to the consumer and other country will impose tariffs in response it never ends pretty. 
t1_duncpb5	0.000000	*	Do they actually biodegrade though?  I've gotten some of those biodegradable cups from a restaurant and left it in my compost bin for over 6 months and nothing happened to it.
t1_dueeyie	-0.128000	*	Weirdly enough he was into escape artistry. They were trying to figure out for a while if he could have done it himself.

t1_duqqtuc	0.557400	*	It's remarkable. Reagan was one of the most brazenly traitorous presidents of all time and he's hardly ever called out as such.
t1_duj3z4f	-0.941900	*	Fo sho. But lawns in areas that are desert are fucking stupid as shit to see and a damn waste. It's all a waste. 
t1_dv2s7j0	0.000000	*	Go on

t1_dutoms1	0.292600	*	It's not even that it stopped raining. It's more like we haven't gotten wet in a while, time to burn our umbrellas! then they walk outside and it's still pouring.

t1_duakskt	-0.128000	*	Prove it please, you made the claim back it up.  In what way was I lied to that influenced me choosing to vote leave where I would otherwise vote to remain.
t1_dv4ar4j	0.318200	*	You should update your original comment then...
t1_dui8sl5	0.908000	*	Lmao it's not about how much work you do, it's about the value of your work. Yes, running a multimillion dollar company and employing 20,000 people is 6000x more valuable than cleaning floors. 
t1_durnvqn	-0.177900	*	Yep, cinnamon whiskey spilled everywhere :(
t1_dv3bfad	-0.930000	*	I was banned from that bullshit sub for asking a question. Fuck you and fuck that sub. 
t1_dumwflj	0.202300	*	Strange that you discount your opinion as having no value, yet make a value judgement on this study.  Do you know how debate and discussion works?

t1_dulo377	-0.401900	*	That's a fairly different situation. Beggars in all countries turn into assholes when someone they perceive as well off doesn't give them money.  
t1_dv0fd7u	0.128000	*	They're not necessarily shitholes for everyone. Perhaps they're a mistreated minority or a poor citizen in a rich country.

t1_dupg6gi	0.273200	*	I'm sorry - I should've put a /s after my obvious solution.  I feel like a jerk for not having done so.
t1_dugs1xp	0.612400	*	Not quite, I'd say. I mean I think you would come up with a different number that 3 million (and 65.8 million).   Adding it together I get 32.7 Clinton voters in states where Trump won.

t1_dv5r47g	0.296000	*	Thats pretty much what challenging Dems are running on, at this point.  Candidates at least, Schumer and co. dont seem to have much fight in them.
