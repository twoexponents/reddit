t1_dt9zbbo	-0.690800	*	Present day calling someone Nazi is an insult. The implication is that they can arrest you for slander, that's what the Nazis would do.

t1_dsjwbo3	-0.639500	*	I come from a country in the Caribbean that is predominantly black. Most people here don't want Haitian immigrants either. Is that racist?

t1_dtlkehz	0.726900	*	I live in Toronto, and I have a feeling the programs are pretty secure here. I think it might just be that you're in a right-leaning area, and I'm in one of the most left-leaning.

t1_dt0t91d	0.250000	*	I'd trust the US military a lot more over the Saudi military, nonetheless I never said anything about the Saudis. I don't know enough on their conflict with Yemen to have an opinion on it.

t1_dss47xi	-0.598700	*	Not claiming police never makes mistakes, but to claim that literal executions are regularly carried out by American police is just dumb and untrue.

t1_dtur193	0.636900	*	Yes, yes i am free to do that. Fuck the police.
t1_dsudxl8	-0.476700	*	The racist sex offender one. Seriously though, as a non US person it looks pretty bad that people are supporting him. It's like something that would happen in the 3rd world or something.

t1_dt1sbwq	-0.024800	*	Yeah but you cannot deny the stock market is rigged against small-time investors. Those who have enough capital to live off their investments often do not work.
t1_dt7h74i	0.238200	*	Good points, but keep in mind even in such a case their military would have to still be maintained, if not grown, to accommodate the new, much larger border with China.

t1_dskqral	0.381800	*	I like how you equate Trump Supporter to Neo-Nazi, which is what the driver actually was. Keep doing that. I am sure it won't backfire and alienate regular people who voted for Trump into hating you.

t1_dsm3fln	-0.278200	*	You seem to be suggesting that the police in the UK do shoot people perhaps in a racially motivated way.  So I'm curious if you know how many people were shot dead by police in the UK last year.

t1_dtmzwez	0.701000	*	The warning of the slant is because he is a.republican and the memo mentions favorable stuff to republican talking points. Just because it benefits the Republicans doesnt make the memo any less true.
t1_dsx0rrr	0.381800	*	The people that actually immigrated tended to work hard and be a benefit to society.  The people you're referring to are Dutch people, since they're the children of (the children of) those immigrants.

t1_dtri4fe	-0.440400	*	Right, the behavior is not conservative. As much as you might want it, that does not take away the political alignment of the perpetrator.

t1_dtjkbz3	-0.882300	*	Yeah but at what point do they realize the stupid shit they are doing doesnt actually work? How many generations does it take to realize this?
t1_dtsnlmx	-0.551400	*	Why? Because it disagrees with your political leanings, certain political groups should be banned from convention? Much of a democracy we have here.
t1_dtrjbgq	-0.271400	*	Because he's clearly mentally ill... and in no way is any of the circle jerk surrounding such mentality responsible.   No sir!
t1_dseg55d	0.340000	*	Well, fortunately, federal funding accounts for only about 25% of transportation funding. If you want to fix your roads, more than likely it comes from your local municipality or state.

t1_dsomsf1	-0.531500	*	My point was that the stock market would not be destroyed. Yes, it would certainly crash. But it would still exist (unless we literally go ballistic and destroy humanity).

t1_dthdrz7	0.226300	*	Well... okay.
t1_dtlc9bh	0.000000	*	You're quoting total count, and Chinese research output is much larger. China would need to have 20x the retraction rate to beat Italy in total retractions.

t1_dsnqij1	0.361200	*	1) You don't know what a straw man is. (Hint: There's not one in anything I've stated here)  2) I'm a bigot because you say so.   Are we done here? It feels like we're done here.

t1_dtb81jh	0.421500	*	Thought I did. Nvm lol. 
t1_dssfo3v	-0.128000	*	We dont decide our elected government officials do.  They make all the deals and charge the other countries, with weapons sales and or provide security forces.  
t1_dswlduw	-0.690100	*	I find it really strange that it's the case. There is a lot of shit to badmouth Trump for without having to resort to his appearance.
t1_dsn0i60	-0.091700	*	The completely closed borders argument is just as much a bogeyman as the open borders one. It's almost hilarious the way each side sees the other at this point.

t1_dtnjq9v	0.000000	*	i dont think u understand how Hamas and Israel operate, and how populated the gaza strip really is.  You think that Israel just shoots at a target without considering civilian causalities first?

t1_dt9yumm	-0.607200	*	Why do I give a shit about individuals that aren't explicitly me? Is that what you're meaning to ask?

t1_dsx0wzq	0.663300	*	To be fair, you were so asking for something along those lines, that I wonder whether it was a legit setup for that punch line. :P
t1_dt5xm20	-0.340000	*	Trump could fire Sessions and put someone in who isn't recused.
t1_dt1mpgg	-0.880700	*	I get a kick out of every user that tags a post with r/latestagecapitalism. They are usually woefully misunderstanding every economic criticism that they are trying to mock. 
t1_dsio12u	0.735100	*	I'd like to think that the 2nd RP was pretty damn good. The best shot we've ever had. Then war happened
t1_dtm3n5u	0.585900	*	Correct as well, but that is dependant on the area. On the east coast, absolutely, some arrived that way. But in the interior, like in Zambia, they were part of the colonial apparatus.
t1_dslxwz3	0.624900	*	You know Australians have it great when it comes to food. 
t1_dtih6sk	-0.831600	*	Also a lot of them believe torture works (mistakenly) and you can't torture them if they're kept somewhere that gives them rights.

t1_dtq9v22	0.177900	*	I know certain societies are just like get your own shopping bags no big deal, but in America that's sac-religious.

t1_dtfbc64	0.000000	*	We're not looking at the entire carbon cycle, we're looking at a small slice of it. The earth's water cycle has a net zero change, but flooding and droughts occur within that.
t1_dskq2u4	0.000000	*	I actually didn't, among other reasons being that you were discussing what PResident 43 did. 
t1_dtvr55n	0.077200	*	you made many pointless assumptions in one sentence

t1_dtbx64u	0.624900	*	On mine personally? Probably no one would care seeing as I live in the UK and have mostly German/Scottish friends.  It was more of a probable outcome for people in the states, by my assumption.
t1_dszzliq	0.440400	*	Pizza Hut is better and that isn't saying much. 
t1_dssl5fz	0.931000	*	Wow, everyone and everything looks so peaceful and pretty. I can't imagine what it feels like to have lived and grown up in Aleppo and seen your home and everything gone.
t1_dsprtkp	0.859100	*	Please feel free to cite a source that is proving ops claim. Unless of course you enjoy believing what only you want to believe. You are only kidding yourself.

t1_dt7an6v	-0.440400	*	Even as a general statement, you just pulled it out of thin air. You're not basing it on anything except what sounds good to your intuition, but your intuition is worthless. 
t1_dt802yb	0.000000	*	I don't think I ever referred to Israelis as a collective. 
t1_dtsz2yj	-0.077200	*	I can picture it in my mind now. And it's just grossing me out. 
t1_dtnhej3	0.318200	*	Wikileaks was a widely supported platform by liberals until they were getting unfavorable news. Wikileaks also hasnt been proven to be unreliable.
t1_dtogg4n	-0.807400	*	Yes, about a million people died in the gulags, and another million in the killing fields. Still ten million short of the Holocaust alone.

t1_dt8zoid	0.128000	*	You keep using the word 'prove.' You don't have to prove it in these types of lawsuits. 99.99% of the time, even being able to suggest it strongly will lead to an out of court settlement.

t1_dsrqef0	-0.476700	*	Youre goddamn right.
t1_dtvmcul	0.239600	*	That makes it endemic? A guy married a dog in India does that make it endemic? No its not a huge problem in Pakistan. However it does fit into your bigoted narrative. 
t1_dsswfup	0.671200	*	ISIS videos have always had great production value. The first time I watched one of their videos I thought that it was a re-enactment because it looked way too polished. Its really weird actually.
t1_dtktxkz	0.273200	*	Not surprising, considering the state of most Americans. 
t1_dsppcvg	0.000000	*	Your belief in a manufactured rating shows yours

t1_dsrhs8w	-0.526700	*	So they basically traded off a happy population for a low crime rate. That would just create a shitty culture, at least they're not NK at least I guess.
t1_dth1zlb	0.214400	*	Fetus is term for a stage of development, yes, but don't means it's not a living human being.
t1_dsjun0e	0.687400	*	See. He never called white supremacists very fine people. He called people attending a rally very fine people. The left called them white supremacists, regardless of whether they are or not.

t1_dsvmngz	0.318200	*	You mean their initial defense of Castile, then their wise silence when it came out he was a prohibited person? The NRA can't defend people who commit felonies, it's just not viable for them
t1_dtbmbck	0.361200	*	As an American Express-ing my opinion, I agree.
t1_dsjvcag	-0.440400	*	Look at the death toll of insurgents vs US military personnel...they didnt stand a chance.

t1_dslcziq	-0.557400	*	Do you want economic collapse due to depopulation? Because disincentivizing parenthood like this is how you get economic collapse due to depopulation.
t1_dsl6vnf	-0.318200	*	They represent the socialistic aspects of a mixed economy. They are the things that were fought for by socialists and social democrats in the late 19th and early 20th century. 
t1_dt8dgpf	-0.695600	*	Sorry for presuming, but these theories seem to speculate that almost *all jews* in congress are secretly Israeli citizens. That's at minimum a conspiracy theory, and comes across anti-semitic to me.

t1_dta8u87	0.765500	*	Yeah especially now that he can't open his mouth without attacking or insulting someone. He is a national embarrassment and he has made the US the laughing stock of the world.

t1_dskg56i	-0.325200	*	Except a lot of people from Europe move to the U.S still, so obviously that isn't as true as you think.
t1_dsxazxv	0.904200	*	What I gathered from part of your post is that we should Make America Great Again.  Then after that we will be in a better position to help others.  I agree with that.
t1_dt798ev	0.000000	*	Sounds kind of similar to Cubans that fled to the US back during the revolution.

t1_dsmjyd5	0.401900	*	Yes. We have a bunch of laws collected over the centuries that act in place of a constitution. That's why it is often referred to as unwritten and so-called. Some of it is European law.  
t1_dt0hd3v	0.361200	*	True enough. And the ones located in airports, if ATL is any indication.  I meant all the standalone Starbucks stores, sorry.

t1_dt02cdz	0.612400	*	Yeah thats pretty much it. The freaks in power ain't even really human. Its why not alot of people can contemplate what really goes on behind the curtains.
t1_dsjxk3w	0.406700	*	Fox News defended the nazis. The president defended the nazis. So, in my opinion, anyone that hasn't turned their backs to both, it's not necessarily a nazi, but it's certainly complacent.

t1_dti90n5	0.000000	*	Of course it is. Life is a game. 
t1_dsuqtpn	-0.771700	*	Well Trump says that theyre likely to over stay their visa and be violent so if you can find less violent people from other countries it makes sense. 
t1_dsrs2su	-0.599400	*	Be silenced you charlatan. We've always been at war with Eurasia.
t1_dsk175r	0.000000	*	That's gay bro
t1_dt8u8l2	0.449700	*	Not an American but the original settlers  ~~were exiled~~  left for the religious differences iirc?  Edit: not exiled
t1_dt2ebnn	0.000000	*	But if Alexander was Macedonian that makes people from Republic of Macedonia his direct decendants. I think this gives them more right to the name Macedonia than the Greeks who are not even Macedonian
t1_dt8u3bx	0.680800	*	Sure, keep your bigotry strong 
t1_dtlhe3j	0.440400	*	Then explain how its easy for a 12yr old to posses a firearm in Los Angels?
t1_dsx3bx8	0.571900	*	Naw, im more a frog guy.  They're ribbit-ed for your pleasure.
t1_dskqggi	-0.438600	*	Cool I guess. But not an argument against any of them.  I'm afraid the old sexist racist homophobic caterwauling lost its effect about 18 months ago. 
t1_dsx50su	0.000000	*	Right, but if the org itself is pro-life(by extension of the people who run it/own it), though the camps it they has nothing to do with abortion, they don't get the funding. 
t1_dti6xlm	0.573900	*	Good thing we're on reddit, and not making actual charges then.  
t1_dt5kyn2	0.737100	*	He spent a year during the primary campaign railing against essentially every trade deal the US has made in the last 30 years. He did not give a shit about the IP provisions. He is against free trade.
t1_dsglses	0.440400	*	Thanks 
t1_dtqd9nq	-0.202300	*	>no way to prevent this, says only country in the world that has more guns than people    There is no simple answer to it, regardless of what you want to believe.
t1_dt2qerf	0.000000	*	Everything is political. That is the nature of politics.
t1_dt02uz0	0.000000	*	And your evidence for that is...?
t1_dt5cl3a	-0.557400	*	Come check out the giant phallus right downtown. It's got a restaurant that rotates so you can look down at the city and see absolutely nothing because it's foggy and cold as shit. 
t1_dsdj0gc	0.909600	*	100% agree but Duterte's popularity is legit and he doesn't need fake elections like ~~Erdongan~~ and Putin to stay in power
t1_dssbvn5	-0.068800	*	Person with an orange clown as president calling other countries banana republic? LOL  maybe do a bit of google before spewing bullshit:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Zarb-e-Azb 
t1_dsjxcu9	-0.718400	*	Ah, the ever-popular fuck you, I got mine argument.
t1_dtmylty	0.000000	*	Its a fucking copy and you know it.
t1_dsjyps4	-0.549900	*	Tons of people here still drink Miller, Coors and Budweiser, but that doesn't mean it isn't all corporate cat piss. 
t1_dtsb8bc	-0.401900	*	But outlook and a slew of other collaboration software manage this for you... Hell it's easy to set up widgets that show you your time, and the local time in a few other places. 
t1_dso40h7	0.510600	*	We is a strong word. Panel show hosts might be a slightly more appropriate phrase
t1_dtg5dlm	-0.696500	*	Not a lawyer, but shouldn't it be easy to establish standing here? It's a cut and dry case of the president not doing his job. Nothing subjective about it. 
t1_dt5w06x	0.401900	*	Technically yes. Except I can do all that while shooting my two Glocks off in the air. 
t1_dsp36tf	0.510600	*	A quick google search shows they stick to International waters, as they are free to do, so says the Pentagon.  And its mostly intelligence/spy ships.
t1_dskh3dd	-0.381800	*	Give up insisting that the opening of embassies can't be large diplomatic events. It's a bit embarrassing.
t1_dsjuwpj	0.226300	*	 I'm surprised he hasn't dropped an N-bomb yet. 
t1_dsk0e9v	-0.381800	*	God you people are literally retarded. 
t1_dstljou	-0.624900	*	The real question is could he be *voted* the worst person in North Korea? 
t1_dsljndq	-0.156600	*	Exactly and it turns a negative experience into a positive one, I mean, who wouldn't want cookies! 
t1_dskjuxk	0.493900	*	Probably made up first hand experience anyways
t1_dstpg3c	0.340000	*	There's certainly enough Trumps to make it work, even at 8 years a piece.
t1_dtdrsnl	0.000000	*	Well sure it looks bad. That's why you just pay some random Chinese guy to do it. Seems like making the assassination attempt's origin untraceable would be the easy part of the whole deal. 
t1_dsr4qgv	0.000000	*	...come in.
t1_dspuq9g	0.000000	*	Be more specific next time.
t1_dtdpyd0	0.000000	*	what do they know? do they know things? lets find out.
t1_dsfr25r	-0.526700	*	I mean as stupid as they are, I don't think even the wildest Trumpets would end their statement with 'PEE ON ME GEOTUS DADDY'. I think some of that's on you my dude.
t1_dst8khw	0.840200	*	He'd better cup that non-dominant hand underneath.  Keeping your thumb back there is a good way to get bitten by the slide.
t1_dsq5sis	0.361200	*	That's a weird thing to say Quxe9bec is pretty diversified culturally.
t1_dstxnlc	0.907100	*	So Palestine is part of Israel now? When did they agree to a one-state agreement?! Wow this is great news!
t1_dsel0sp	-0.765000	*	Nothing silly about it. The devastation brought upon Europe by two world wars is unmatched by anything else.
t1_dt1hlyb	-0.824800	*	Sure, but that doesn't have anything to do with your second paragraph being flat out wrong. Even a basic Wikipedia search will prove you wrong on that one. 
t1_dtrvtk8	0.000000	*	**Please read para 2 of my post several times.**
t1_dt918l8	0.033400	*	Yeah, I'm totally sure your loser arse could have pulled it off.

t1_dsmvl8m	0.000000	*	 ........  So you're saying Obama's a Marxist?
t1_dsvhlpw	-0.768400	*	It's when you enforce it against people from one country but not another because of the majority race of those countries.  That's called racism.
t1_dtqr9od	-0.177900	*	Well that's kind of the Leftist mindset in a nutshell. If there's no enemy to rail against you have to actually be introspective and ask if what you're doing is useful.
t1_dt6nxmf	0.571900	*	Whatever makes you happy
t1_dtn5eti	0.000000	*	It doesn't suggest that, you're inferring it incorrectly. 
t1_dsfij8n	0.636900	*	Exactly. Hasn't even been three generations since the North and South divided. There are still plenty of people alive who lived in a unified Korea.
t1_dtmjq52	-0.308000	*	It is either OMG TRADE ARMAGEDDON! or it isn't a huge deal. Which one is it? 
t1_dszcqc1	0.273200	*	You're right martians would be strongly mislead by many headlines on Earth.

t1_dsp6rkw	0.318200	*	Cool, I've always wanted to live on Tatooine
t1_dt66ncr	0.153100	*	Something else there's no evidence of regarding Trump, nice.
t1_dtn3t74	0.000000	*	Ahh so youre still being educated. Makes sense since you cant seem to properly extrapolate data or choose a reliable source (in the case of the YouTube video).
t1_dsi6zdc	0.177900	*	Good rule of thumb: If it flies then no, it's not made of steel.
t1_dtswwlt	0.636900	*	I'm way better than him but as far as seriousness?...forget it. He's pure comedy fodder. 
t1_dsl74dw	0.000000	*	Military bases are considered to be US soil.

t1_dtl5vql	-0.340000	*	I don't think anyone here is advocating about buying someone a fix with taxpayer money.  if anyone is they are crazy.

t1_dt7y1lz	0.000000	*	What if the mechanism also vibrates to get rid of the sand?
t1_dt36j3w	-0.804700	*	Not what I said, but if you pick up a Honduran you don't just throw them in Mexico. If they're going to get killed in Honduras then what is the moral choice?
t1_dsq7lci	0.599400	*	Lmao he has the smuggest smile I have ever seen. 
t1_dttm9uz	-0.510600	*	Taxes are a big factor. If only you could set that up right. Instead of swinging political dick all over twitter and getting an orange tan.
t1_dshvf16	-0.361200	*	Then Libya as well.  We came, we saw, he died.
t1_dssf05k	0.000000	*	How do you get around the issue of BTC being a competitor to the USD?
t1_dt9e3j7	0.750600	*	Do you think there's a superior alternative asside from just making science better through regulation/funding?
t1_dtpvg43	0.421500	*	Nice try, Ivan.
t1_dsinxny	0.154800	*	> a prehistorian guy has these kind of stops.  Is like you... How is a prehistorian guy different ? 
t1_dtu0q00	0.361200	*	I just saw the first episode of this show that's about VW and laughed on seeing Mrwebente's comment that they admitted it. They tried covering it up for years after being suspected of it.
t1_dt5vkco	0.296000	*	If Trump is a sacrificial lamb I'm ok with it
t1_dspitb5	-0.571900	*	But blast radius is not linear with the amount of destruction, blast area is.
t1_dsk8f2z	0.296000	*	I chuckled at this comment.
t1_dsutv4z	0.771700	*	why cant we make our country better while also helping make our allies and neighbors stronger, thats what these types of visa programs do
t1_dsrmnuw	0.000000	*	American democracy is an illusion. 
t1_dtiqk4v	0.000000	*	Because personally I don't see any evidence trump met or allowed this man in.
t1_dt9qwoe	0.526700	*	Well I obviously agree, that sort of behaviour is ridiculous. However, I did specify in my original post that as long as they didn't act on it.   
t1_dsk2cmc	0.000000	*	Russia, Ukraine for starters.
t1_dtgl02s	0.510600	*	Farmed to be slaughtered for food and farmed to be slaughtered for fun are different moral situations would be my point

t1_dtj44z5	0.000000	*	That is not how child development works. 
t1_dtx0xmc	0.807400	*	That's a great point, you are right. I just think the other guy was underestimating the number of trump supporters.
t1_dt6p54u	-0.296000	*	Yea thats not correct and I have no skin in the game. You need to read the full story. 
t1_dt8ib7w	0.000000	*	Also known as affirmative action. Morally indefensible in any circumstance....but womyn....
t1_dt9735v	0.873000	*	Yeah.. The Free State project epi-center is not far from where I live..  It is definitely in a 'rough' phase at this point.    Grafton NH is considered ground zero.  
t1_dt5t9hz	0.708900	*	Thanks. I did not know that, very interesting.
t1_dsrcl1i	0.102700	*	I agree the EU is open. But the post above suggested the EU should not offer any deal at all. That is what I am calling a foolish move.  
t1_dt3x98g	0.640800	*	Well I couldn't find a more accurate wording there. :P
t1_dtj70an	0.000000	*	People didn't have access to potable water... 
t1_dt7jygc	0.571900	*	Corporate tax is inefficient. Be happy.
t1_dsuu911	-0.624900	*	Should =/= is willing to. There is a soft racism of the left and calling me dense won't refute that.

t1_dtig47u	0.510600	*	Well yeah, it does say *human* rights, afterall.  What's more human than being American?

t1_dtnbft2	-0.340000	*	The FBI and the CIA still acknowledge that the report is uncorroborated.  Why do you deny that?  The other stuff you're discussing isn't related to whether or not the report is factual or not.  
t1_dto30x5	0.401900	*	Cities in Canada definitely are diverse though. Just get on any bus in Toronto or Vancouver.
t1_dtaabhh	0.510600	*	Yeah, because dosing yourself with drugs solves a lot of things, doesn't it.

t1_dt2epg7	0.510500	*	What about the Ming dynasty previous the Qing? It was authoritarian but some historians think it was the most advanced civilization in the world at its time?
t1_dskg9h1	-0.025800	*	Oh my God, Americans  what have you done? How could America  lower it's  standards  this way. 
t1_dto0h3j	-0.742400	*	No he didn't say that! It's just lies on top of lies with you people isn't it?

t1_dt31py6	0.259300	*	Ok, what is your idea about God? Do you pray? Do you believe in Heaven and Hell? Prove me wrong about your beliefs. I want you to, because as far as I see; that's what your beliefs boil down to.

t1_dsf8nzg	0.204000	*	All the wool socks Ive found so far are a wool/nylon blend.   Finding any article of clothing thats 100% natural fibers is really hard.

t1_dt83ozn	0.000000	*	But is could be.
t1_dt7ymh6	-0.700300	*	Yes, this is true. but it's also much easier to operate with small damage over time instead of vastly devastating catastrophies every few decades.
t1_dsxxqyx	0.273200	*	Well i would expect him not to give details, since there'll probably be a noice publication at the horizon
t1_dt7rzui	-0.325200	*	Twins arent born in mature adult bodies with fully functioning adult brains as far as im aware.

t1_dsqiiyi	-0.296000	*	You're the one who accused him of not allowing you to explain yourself. Maybe get it right the first time. 
t1_dsn5qwz	0.270900	*	You got any its not?    Like I said, things have been going pretty good since him becoming POTUS.  I will worry if that changes..  
t1_dsxqzij	-0.057200	*	They aren't doing it - they aren't forcing women to have babies they don't want. They literally just have a different view point. *they aren't taking away any rights from anyone*

t1_dsoqpxr	-0.151100	*	Not many billionaires have idle time.   They didn't become billionaires playing Xbox.  
t1_dt2m9h5	-0.525500	*	Why are you comparing Obama to Hitler?  I think that's patently unfair!

t1_dsj36dz	0.296000	*	Ok, moving on.
t1_dtfzrh9	0.051600	*	I think it's a vicious circle. Flashier presentation in the media gives a short term rating boost, people who get used to flashier presentations expect that kind of coverage.
t1_dsqquml	-0.476700	*	Unless you're using liberal to mean something other than people who were on the left in the 60s, then you're wrong.  MLKs statement wasn't against liberals. It was against moderates.

t1_dth0keg	-0.799800	*	Eh? They're both examples of Britons despising witnessing discrimination. What's wrong with that comparison?
t1_dtakjka	-0.936000	*	Am I wrong though? They're fuckig dumb. It's a fact. By voting for trump they proved to the whole world they love racism and homophobia and rape. That's fucking dumb. 
t1_dswjotg	-0.359700	*	It is to an extent. But Russia is especially bad because the country itself helps their athletes do it. They also help them cheat the tests.
t1_dsikpes	0.000000	*	You may also be in a different province. Each province has slightly different coverages 
t1_dsuxho5	0.000000	*	Weird- didn't know that defending 100 Haitians who would be here legally and reciting a poem was a ringing endorsement for uncontrolled immigration.

t1_dtp33pu	0.557400	*	A lot of it has to do with the game Crusader Kings 2. Converting to Zoroastrianism is a bit of a meme because it actually gives you bonuses for marrying your immediate family.

t1_dslmzte	-0.296000	*	I think you missed my point:  the media's virtual silence on shitshow vs their vapors over shithole, when both statements involved what I guess you could call countries with POC.
t1_dswvyac	-0.596700	*	You can't find many intelligent people who will argue against climate change these days.

t1_dtavou6	0.000000	*	Tell it to Dickens
t1_dtuaa4v	0.343400	*	I guarantee no Polak would ever think of saying that. Its just not fucking accurate.  I doubt many people will go to jail because of this law unless they literarily want to.
t1_dtiy6c5	0.000000	*	He never said that, but this is the case with most homeless shelters.
t1_dsfhwjh	-0.361200	*	I know this.  Liberal reddit chooses to ignore his shortfalls.

t1_dsfjsgz	-0.642800	*	Also you are actually adding characters in order to spell it wrong, something like alot is annoying, but at least you can argue it is quicker to type without using a space.
t1_dtkblpl	0.458800	*	I'd be down with a cure for balding. I'm in the early stages of thinning, so that would be welcome news.
t1_dshap0e	0.025800	*	It means ethnic extermination. Play semantics and you've lost. Typical deflection. 
t1_dtq0s1y	0.420100	*	It's more like, white women not having any children. The declining birth rates are being alleviated by immigration from Africa.

t1_dsl1wbx	0.599400	*	How is it possible that it's 2018 and people like you still don't understand polling and its value? This is an incredible indictment of the schools you attended.
t1_dtepma7	0.000000	*	Was that before or after his Lady Di comments?
t1_dskp2y7	0.380400	*	But they didn't vote for Trump so your point is kind of irrelevant. Don't lump people who wanted a different option in with people who fully supported and voted for this egomaniacal asshole

t1_dspkk3s	0.381800	*	Yes, a press statement from the government agency posted on Facebook. Why are you going to these lengths to give IS the benefit of the doubt? I feel like a broken record.
t1_dslhnof	-0.476700	*	Maybe Alabamans, being violent, criminal, and hyper-religious, dont deserve the rights or freedom of movement given to more civilized Americans.

t1_dstmufd	-0.476700	*	Society at large is quite religious. We are outliers for not being religious.   You badly need to step outside the /r/atheism bubble. What you are saying does not in any way match reality.
t1_dssi512	-0.077200	*	Or how Scientology sells the truth to their followers, or how big televangeists sell forgiveness and healing.... Religion is a scam.

t1_dtr4ohc	0.306700	*	I don't, just like lots of people who think they are entitled to something you will not change your mind.it's not your fault. It's education. Maybe mine but.. History suggests not mine...
t1_dsyxlro	0.735100	*	Healthcare is never going to be a free market because you want standards and laws to be in place to protect the patients. This will always decrease the available potential supply.

t1_dspnmty	0.377700	*	Yeah, one of my first memories was watching 9/11 on the news, and my 4 year old self wasn't traumatized. However I was very mentally affected years later as an adult watching videos on watchpeopledie.

t1_dtok6ay	-0.381800	*	Ummm... thats just factually wrong   Can Canada go toe to toe with Russia on its own... no absolutely not. But Canadas military definitely can bat above its weight in many situations.

t1_dtoxwy0	0.421500	*	Yeah but all the important parts are in the southern 1/3rd. Basically take out Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal and the rest of the country falls. 
t1_dt9fka1	0.000000	*	Taxes*
t1_dsegwh3	-0.051600	*	When Trump tweets I LITERALLY first look to see if it's The Onion before I get nervous. One day it *will* be The Onion, dammit. ;)

t1_dt7xqsd	-0.296000	*	That's still in its testing phase, no?
t1_dthx8ql	-0.571900	*	Some would consider it pathetic to not be able to think for oneself.
t1_dtdfeiv	-0.128000	*	No, that would be rigged. But unlike other candidates past, Navalny has a pretty big operation throughout Russia, so his election monitors would have caught it.

t1_dt5u6d8	-0.296000	*	Literally both of those are Russian sponsored talking points with no basis in reality.
t1_dtd9fff	0.594000	*	How do you figure? What options do they have? If peace were so simple that a random redditor could figure it out it would've been done by now
t1_dslgtu3	0.128000	*	And in all of those instances, Republicans rushed to Trumps defense. But thats not happening here. Because that statement by the WH official is a lie.

t1_dtcso12	0.440400	*	There is such a thing as a vegan diet, which I expect (but can't say for certain) is the working definition that most people are using and is a useful word for being more restrictive than vegetarian.
t1_dtoyghm	-0.559700	*	It's not the cause that these people, which I am not one of, romanticize, but rather the struggle against overwhelming odds to keep their way of life.   
t1_dszz3uu	-0.153100	*	All of America was in bed with Russian oligarch's. I doubt in 2008 you would have found many dissenters in either party complaining about Russian roubles.

t1_dsffydi	0.636900	*	The 'You' in these sentences are rhetorical.  He is basically saying that if you do those things, you become like what Russia is experiencing now; a brain drain and reliance on natural resources.

t1_dsmh2ac	0.401900	*	Yes, my comment was too hyperbolic. I was referring to the stabbing method. I should have specified that.

t1_dt8f1kq	-0.458800	*	Prosperous for the world at large. Global development since 1945 is entirely unprecedented in the history of humanity. As awful as the world is for far too many people, it used to be much worse.
t1_dsyjjma	-0.381800	*	No, you're right, I have a retirement plan set up. But that isn't set up to pay less taxes; its so I can continue to be self-sufficient.

t1_dtr81pt	0.546800	*	I think you're misinterpreting the statement. When people can afford care in the US, it's usually very good. The problem is that many can't afford it not that the care itself is of poor quality.

t1_dt626dl	0.361200	*	Absolutely. However, it often seems that internet voices (and by extension, internet anonymity) has greater large-scale power than cross-the-table conversations. I guess thats what I was considering.
t1_dt9eklw	-0.830700	*	Ah contraire! Have you seen some of the judges hes put in place? Some of the crap legislation passed? This guy is doing damage and some of it cannot be easily undone!

t1_dsmj5lv	0.401900	*	Apparently in my dreams I'm a Lobster at dc3's granddad's house.
t1_dtmzimo	-0.250000	*	As much as you dont like Nunes he is the chairman of that committee , he didnt just pull all this out of his ass.
t1_dtomq4x	-0.700300	*	It is normal fisa procedure, something Nunes fought for himself. But suddenly, when it catches one of 'their guys' being a traitor to America, it's bad? 
t1_dso59ah	0.000000	*	Maybe but your comment doesn't. 
t1_dteyhlk	0.000000	*	I just quoted the wiki page, which quoted a leading feminist. As for chasing ghosts, I don't know anything about that.
t1_dsdtwdp	0.000000	*	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_facts
t1_dt5vp24	0.000000	*	Tibet? The state ran on a monarchy full of slaves? Ok...
t1_dtfgim2	-0.102700	*	They do in China. They pay money for white butler's or just dudes to dress up in suits and hang out at meetings. Its a status thing.
t1_dsjvyo6	0.782800	*	Irrelevant. The quality of immigrants' countries of origin was not what was disgusting about his statement and you know it. Don't pretend the president speaking like this is acceptable.
t1_dsmraym	0.000000	*	According to IMDB it was [Rod Steiger](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001768/?ref_=tt_cl_t11).
t1_dtqj664	-0.243900	*	And yet they still don't prevent the tens of thousands of automobile deaths that occur annually in the US.    Solid argument against humans ever being given control of either, I say.  
t1_dtfrk2k	0.636900	*	Alright fair. We allow the kardashians to exist so
t1_dslyxqm	-0.458800	*	It's awful.
t1_dsnfjk6	0.000000	*	You don't know how to Google?

t1_dsln6u8	0.017000	*	Right, it would be like wanting to learn galic... like it's neat I suppose but not really useful for me outside maybe getting a job. (I'm comparing to Scandinavian languages)
t1_dsvrmvf	-0.659700	*	Yeah, graphene will take us to space and beyond....once we figure out how to keep it from giving us cancer and how to assemble shit from it that's larger than a finger.
t1_dskxrcb	0.543500	*	Im confused then, are you saying that if i didnt show up to work that i would not be fired? Or that if i was fired i could continue to pay rent?

t1_dt33hch	0.061100	*	Yes, the second time I watched it and the more I think about it I cannot conclude what he was doing, so I am not sure but those were my initial reactions.

t1_dsz4eix	0.000000	*	Opioid* not opiates. Very different.

t1_dtsi7zv	0.000000	*	Was it?  Do you have any proof of that *whatsoever*?  Is the memo confirming they had **no other evidence** than that dossier (it's not)?   
t1_dt2bozo	-0.318200	*	You have no idea...you should read about the shit weve done in South America in the 19th and 20th centuries. Our government perfected the terrorist attack.

t1_dt8ewz5	-0.771700	*	You are free to. The worst you can expect is to be mocked. No one will arrest you.
t1_dteuskl	0.318200	*	I found it odd that somone would brag about deleting their comments. Similar to a toddler proudly exclaiming that they have a bellybutton. Juvenile, that's all.
t1_dtcl5fx	-0.612400	*	No we dont, we also dont need to waste any more resources then we need to.
t1_dsmjs6a	0.102700	*	Sure, alleged.   Hes alleged engaged in illegal activities - so theres your answer as to what people are talking about when they reference Trumps impeachment/crimes. 
t1_dsyvz80	0.000000	*	Hold my Double Double, I'm going in...
t1_dsj989s	0.000000	*	They wouldn't, they would have to close down, that was the point I was making.
t1_dt5vxhu	0.000000	*	Then he stays president. And bipartisanship would grow I'd imagine. Not to mention any Republican against him possibly ending their career. 
t1_dsvx4cm	-0.624900	*	Is me sending my kid to a private school racism?
t1_dteufoi	0.000000	*	Two hours later Im cringing when I get a notification and am reminded of my thoughts 
t1_dto3u5g	-0.769900	*	They don't call him mad dog for no reason. Is it bad I want to see what this is man could do in all out war? 
t1_dtsw5bz	-0.888500	*	Well, in the US it apparently has to be *direct*, i.e. let's kill John. Not kill white people.   No idea why they consider that a reasonable distinction. 
t1_dta4eth	0.775700	*	How does one define dignity? If someone wins a debate against me, could I sue them for hurting my dignity?
t1_dtwzudm	-0.102700	*	Why do you think Minnesotans are hard to befriend? I'm not saying they aren't. I'm asking regarding your experience. 
t1_dtrqene	0.296000	*	Just a joke.
t1_dt0ioul	0.726900	*	That's the funny thing, the US doesn't get a whole bunch of oil from Saudi Arabia. Europe on the other hand, does. 
t1_dsv74em	0.083900	*	The other person doesn't matter. They just make up a story to shift blame. It's easier if it's someone your parents can't talk to so they don't get the real version of events.
t1_dsl0spb	-0.670500	*	The only difference is that anyone with an understanding of taxes knows that the tax bill killed thousands of times more people than my example. 
t1_dsubttj	0.361200	*	The locals were Normans. Again the language they spoke does not make them French, France didn't exist back then like it does today. You wouldn't say Anglo-Saxons are German would you.
t1_dslha7d	0.000000	*	Hold down 0 (zero) on an iPhone to get xb0 too. 
t1_dsiufjf	0.458800	*	But they love Chelsea Manning? That makes no sense.
t1_dsy15lc	-0.151100	*	4 would be an upper boundary. Perhaps 2-4 would be a more accurate reflection of my thoughts there. But don't underestimate how intelligent some animals are.

t1_dtn2ys3	0.000000	*	When's the last time you saw someone crucified though?
t1_dttwfnr	0.900200	*	Yes, because the US is the highest standard of freedom that we should all aspire to. How about we don't censor either muslims and communists nor hateful people?
t1_dt4lyjg	0.598300	*	The biggest cost to people from this tax plan will be its use in justifying gutting of safety nets. These rubes are getting their pennies to cheer on the destruction and think it's helping them! 
t1_dsjpmtp	-0.888400	*	No. They are just not giving extra special sympathy considering how many people were fucked worse by the US. And that is valid.
t1_dsg3cr1	0.885200	*	Oh indeed, that's a good callout, but it's The Wire****  Not wired!WTF!!! I do like you though :) 
t1_dtocmjl	-0.401900	*	Are you under the impression xenophobia and racism are mutually exclusive?

t1_dswmypp	-0.886000	*	if that baby was going to kill the mother during delivery the next day, is it still murder or self-defence?

t1_dsk5oop	-0.110900	*	This is straight up not true.
t1_dtennto	0.000000	*	 We won't eat nearly as much meat in a few years. With less farmyard animals that we eat,  will only be farmed for select animals.
t1_dsuqa37	0.796400	*	> He's being raked through the coals  By whom? Trump supporters I know love him as much as ever. 
t1_dtp9jwy	-0.296000	*	Thanks, I didn't verify, however I do have a podcast which claims psychology is the worst. I will see if there is a transcript I can post her here.
t1_dtk10jm	0.000000	*	It is neither of those things.  Since they don't use anesthesia they have to strap the baby down to keep it from thrashing, and it has a high complication rate for a medically unnecessary procedure.
t1_dt6aqrr	-0.286900	*	What if theyre marching with Nazi flags and throwing up Nazi salutes? *Then* can I assume theyre Neo-Nazi Fascists?  
t1_dt0y4dn	-0.525500	*	What is my conspiracy theory then?  I hope it's nazis in the moon. God I hate nazis!
t1_dslwh7b	-0.414700	*	Nope.  Insurance would not pay for damages due to illegal construction.  Stairs are HUGE in Building Codes, liability, and insurance due to how dangerous they can be if improperly installed.
t1_dtdcp5g	-0.697300	*	no need to move the goalposts, you clearly stepped into an argument unprepared, and with seemingly heavy CNN bias. not the best plan - T. Stark 
t1_dsq7a4n	0.154800	*	Irrelevant interest is very low.
t1_dsi78mn	0.697900	*	Of course, but ours never murdered tens of millions of people, as in Russia, China, Cambodia, North Korea, etc. etc. etc.  If you cannot see the difference you need to take a profound moral inventory.
t1_dtd0l74	0.642800	*	People say catastrophic effects but they never say specifically what. I'm sure we can build stronger structures or adapt. 
t1_dstpvmq	0.000000	*	For ripple

t1_dtkecuw	0.077200	*	It's a democracy, so why do people keep voting these guys who only want to fill their own pockets.
t1_dtkfffx	0.862200	*	Uh, but, you were.  Your entire civilization is built on carcinogens.  Edit: ...how on earth was this controversial? I think we're pretty agreed that plastics are carcinogenic at this point, surely! 
t1_dtg2utj	0.659700	*	Yes yes, imbibe the kool-aid, let it flow through your veins.

t1_dt6jyh1	0.000000	*	> it infringes on ~~other~~ human rights  There, fixed it for him.  It baffles me that trying to force others to belive in Santa Claus or the Eater bunny is actually a human right.

t1_dt4pzyo	-0.275500	*	For whatever reason, weed smoke smell doesn't stick around like tobacco smoke does. If you open up a couple Windows and air the place out for a day or two, the smell will be completely gone

t1_dtixral	0.812600	*	An agreement under gunpoint isn't an agreement. The US was literally occupying Cuba when that so called independence was granted.

t1_dtfnke9	-0.448100	*	Do you really think Mueller is going to show all of his cards right away? He's flipping guys using lesser charges, which is straight from the playbook. Don't be so naive.
t1_dsrb3o6	-0.025800	*	And the EU has already pointed out that they would allow the UK to cancel article 50. Gleefully.
t1_dthv03v	0.718400	*	Hopefully. If he was handling things so sensitive that he was arming al-Qaeda, then he might have a get out of jail free card.
t1_dsewcoa	0.725900	*	Good, I really don't give a shit about your opinion. 
t1_dths4c3	0.000000	*	Altruism? What's that, some kind of pill? 
t1_dt1mduu	0.769100	*	Haha. You do not have a chance at changing a non democratic government like in China at all.  Google is way better than having the Chinese government dictate what you can and cannot see, any day. 
t1_dsuk029	0.440400	*	Thats actually a good point. I dont see the Chinese government changing anytime soon, though. 
t1_dsztepc	0.510600	*	Eh, pretty much every country missed the original date.

t1_dsnxqhw	-0.599400	*	[Oh it was] (http://time.com/4722209/judge-president-trump-rally-violence/). It probably just got drowned out in all the rest of the Trump news that week, that's all.

t1_dsthxnz	-0.585900	*	I doubt that Americans are even close to German looks. Do you really believe that the world thinks of Americans as blonde and blue eyed? That is the German stereotype, chief.
t1_dsjhugz	0.895800	*	It's hilarious how much they go on about Freedom, and how little freedom they have compared to most western european countries.
t1_dsqeajj	-0.937100	*	She literally made up a hate crime. That's supplying the need for hate crime.
t1_dtbanyx	0.000000	*	And a football player on Germany's team is called Boateng. Immigration is a thing that happens.

t1_dtmfykx	0.381800	*	The dude you're replying to is one of the uneducated ones if he thinks HK's democracy compares favorably with America's
t1_dt2ehra	-0.924600	*	Well yes the genocide and slavery did help them an awful lot, so maybe thriving on war is the wrong thing to say, thriving on violence in general would be more accurate
t1_dt8tqh2	-0.296000	*	We wont get shot though. No guns. 
t1_dtv9y51	0.000000	*	Would you say the same about countries? States are different places due to some cases of cultural difference.

t1_dtcqaod	-0.401900	*	But that will be a direct sabotage of one's pleasure. Following the laws of physics and laws of man in vexing enough. Why must one endure non-official made-up codes too?

t1_dt5qxul	-0.166500	*	Did you go to China?  Okay well, me as an Asian is telling you I don't want to be white.  So does count for something?  Or do I not count.  White people aren't as amazing as some of you think you are.

t1_dtwow7o	0.631000	*	I love politics, Trump has appointed a great cabinet. Not just Steve Mnuchin, but Steve Womnuchin and Steve Childrnuchin too.
t1_dsq5wl5	0.139500	*	Yeah, but the parts alone are worth more than the value of your 86 Taurus.

t1_dt5xls2	0.250000	*	For people who support a man who was a registered Democrat longer than he's been a Republican to say the likes of John McCain aren't real Republicans is some kind of warped mind fuck.
t1_dsta4qd	-0.296000	*	Besides the hardware side of things, maybe the market can become big enough as to resist manipulation (since it's also a global delocalised market).

t1_dsutp3t	0.820500	*	I'm black lmao I assure you I don't have a problem with black immigrants, its a fact that 40% of Haitians on this low-skill visa overstay, vs ~1% for all other visas.
t1_dsw9qfx	0.765400	*	Best thing about Abbott was it was such a whacky ride that you didn't have to worry too much about anything actually coming to fruition. 
t1_dtlj4pw	0.493900	*	Does your friend know there's more than one school in the U.S.?
t1_dtj7b9q	-0.718400	*	Yes they do and most people in their are terrorists very few are falsely convicted so the pros (terrorists being tortured and imprisoned) outweigh the false convictions

t1_dtohui2	-0.807000	*	At least you're honest. The Communists, Bolsheviks, and anti-fascists were incredibly brutal and depraved. Its no wonder the fascists feared them after they saw what happened in Russia.
t1_dtclpoc	0.359100	*	America does not work like the nazis. People are free to do what they want. Even be un-american.
t1_dtou2vj	-0.363200	*	A lot of republicans do not like Trump. I'll take the evidence of bias that they've recovered that literally has people talking about insurance policies against Trump becoming president.

t1_dsow54c	-0.929900	*	Yup. And destructive power scales exponentially with megatonnage. A 100 megaton bomb would be incredibly devastating.   Edit: nvm; sounds like I'm wrong. Nonetheless, 100 MT is still a powerful bomb. 
t1_dt1jt9y	0.669700	*	Fucking love navy fed

t1_dso1zy1	0.000000	*	People do often talk about an unwritten constitution, and we have constitutional experts that try to parse out the sort of unwritten expectations from the assembly of laws and common practice.

t1_dskegly	-0.192600	*	So there is another side to the story of Putin not allowing anyone to seriously challenge him in the elections? Is it a lie made up by the western media?

t1_dtkbqok	0.305400	*	And be the ones exploiting it to make more money. Thank God we at least have a few Bill Gates types in this world.

t1_dt5axgr	-0.493900	*	You can literally walk down Yonge st smoking a joint and no one, cops included will give a fuck. It has been like that for years now.

t1_dtdm4y4	-0.865800	*	It's one thing chucking out random shit, but chucking out sleeping bags in mid winter can have fatal consequences.  The council should not be putting peoples' lives at risk.   
t1_dswaf9d	0.458800	*	Then what's all the fuss about? Honestly, I was just about to start shipping Dasani donations to them...
t1_dtbvv35	-0.476700	*	Ever taken a college chemistry class? I learned enough to be dangerous. I'd probably get myself blown up messing around with it though. 
t1_dstlll9	-0.140600	*	The ignorant statement actually is to say that one knows about Pizza because one is a New Yorker.  I reacted to that... but well...

t1_dt0unk1	0.000000	*	Just looked outside, the sky is gray.
t1_dta6sze	0.700300	*	Iirc, it's because boys learn better with hands on experience while girls learn better through theory. So the focus is on hold a pen=theory
t1_dtfdlys	0.273200	*	Well, my answer to the other dudes question would be the same to this one.
t1_dsgsc4u	0.000000	*	I didn't say it was.  Just pointing out that your idea that you can't mention someone in a book without speaking with them directly is asinine.
t1_dt6uxdy	0.571900	*	Maybe it the first turn. But in the second turn he wins all the left votes, and people more moderate who cold vote for bolsonaro over lula (one extreme over the other), might prefer the moderate. 
t1_dtqjtle	-0.846100	*	Alot of bullshit can be argued. A land dispute between governments is not a matter of perspective, it's a matter of public policy.
t1_dtjqe67	0.000000	*	There's investing heavily and then there's subsidized to the point of being able to sell at below cost.  They were doing the latter.

t1_dsx9rko	-0.440300	*	That is communism. The end goal of socialism is communism but in socialism the means of production is owned by the state. Idk why its so hard for you people to understand that.

t1_dt0soar	-0.102700	*	Live in the US.  Could say it anywhere you want.  Altthough, suddenly saying it in a work meeting or the drive thru at McDonald's might get you some weird looks.

t1_dsdzl1c	-0.870300	*	All those countries have declared war on Israel so it's not surprising Israel wouldn't allow travel to its enemies. 
t1_dsf7rrt	0.273200	*	Well you didn't refute it. White men are coddled by society and more likely to apply for things they don't have qualifications for. See I can invent a backstory too

t1_dtde42c	0.000000	*	A Luigi board?
t1_dtd9zbx	0.043600	*	This is not an acceptable reply.  No one will take you seriously if you keep saying things like this.  I'm interested in what you have to say, but you need to post some evidence.
t1_dsi6lg0	-0.318200	*	Yes.  Many Trump opponents have lost their fucking mind.  1 million of them walked around Washington with Pussies on their heads and they hold rallies to scream at the clouds.
t1_dsne1en	0.318200	*	I mean when you just made up a false dichotomy sure. There is more than neutral and extreme left and right.

t1_dt2ja3o	0.177900	*	Consider the author. Just funny that you can turn your own words against him now and he would have no reply.
t1_dtu0lh8	0.000000	*	Probably not anyone in the scientific community I would assume. But you never know. 
t1_dtg8ph1	0.000000	*	I feel you but that's a really specific portion of the population and that group is nearly only men so I don't really see what point you're trying to make. 
t1_dszxgba	-0.318200	*	I would take this job if I could trap myself on the Candian side.
t1_dtfz424	-0.458800	*	Exactly. There are so many ways to smuggle in drugs if you try hard enough.

t1_dsnvk33	0.039200	*	Read the rest of the comment. Not only do they not care about politicians dying, they want the ones they don't agree with killed, and often do that themselves.
t1_dsjxxui	-0.214500	*	Any country is a shithole country if you think it is. It's an opinion. There's no objective measure for shitholeness of a country. That's why these BUT IT'S TECHNICALLY TRUE comments are just moronic.

t1_dttdpp7	0.670500	*	Americans were much richer per capita than British people by the 1790s. That's what cheap land for all can do.  Well, as long as you weren't a slave.

t1_dt2o7gs	0.311700	*	The lords having their power stripped away and the electoral districts being more or less fair are some of the biggest changes the system needed. Now the big thing to be updated is FPTP.
t1_dt8q1or	0.092600	*	The EU isn't arguing that it wasn't mutually beneficient for those two.  The EU is arguing that it was detrimential to everyone else, stifling competition and harming the market as a whole this way.

t1_dtqw03s	-0.440800	*	I think your missing the point. Israel does negative things to Palestine all the time. Disapproving of a country's actions does not mean you hate that country's people. Even if it is Israel.
t1_dsfqbj9	0.798500	*	Yes but they can't reject candidates for no reason. Rouhani was not the SL's choice at all. He wanted Veylati to win.

t1_dswll39	0.250000	*	Or even just because they aren't publicly supportting something that is protected by law. It would also make sense to not fund organizations that support illegal drug use and racism/discrimination.
t1_dtn8v4v	-0.780400	*	Oh I have no clue.   I can understand some of the arguments Ive heard. But from what I know, I would have voted NO.

t1_dsih8fd	-0.757900	*	Hitler was voted in to power and this was after a failed coup attempt 7 years before that. Does that make all Germans hateful, bigoted and anti-democratic?
t1_dt32t83	0.202300	*	Weird, they are like the same anime.
t1_dt4qufn	0.260900	*	Very true.  Not wanting to start any debates.  I just felt it was brought up not completely off base, but I see what you mean.

t1_dt84y5q	-0.866300	*	The worst estimates are at about 300.000 up to a million. And in any case, people here will still claim only 20 people or so died.

t1_dsk0gre	-0.543900	*	To you, being reasonable is denying anything that doesn't fit your narrative. All you've been doing on this thread is moving the goal post.
t1_dt224l8	0.401900	*	I would be interested to hear some more specific examples. I presume you are talking about today?
t1_dslcekp	0.536200	*	Yes it is. Grumbled they all have aids under his breath? Are you kidding me?
t1_dt7fj9s	0.000000	*	It was just the Korean long con. South Korea builds an economic base, North Korea builds a military. They unify, take over the whole world. 
t1_dsix0k0	-0.401900	*	The problem with her statement about seeing Russia from Alaska was that she was trying to sell that fact as foreign policy experience
t1_dsxuge7	0.000000	*	So if they don't have to recognize the referendum and Russia has since then reaffirmed that Crimea was part of Ukraine numerous times, how can you claim Ukraine stole Crimea from Russia? 
t1_dsjekkx	-0.242000	*	I have honestly no idea how to answer that question without a good example. If he ran against Samsom I think Wilders would get maybe 30-35% of the votes? What do you think?
t1_dsuu81f	0.202300	*	Brits aren't Haitian refugees. If you're a Brit going to Australia, chances are it's because you a) already have family there or b) have a job lined up already.

t1_dseudyd	0.000000	*	But where?
t1_dsv694y	-0.275500	*	So you don't have any statistics, you just don't like immigrants and decide that your feelings are facts?  Thought so.
t1_dtlljf0	0.000000	*	I've smoked almost every day for over 4 years, and in terms of a buzz, a hit of weed is probably equivalent to a couple drinks. What kind of schwag are you smoking??
t1_dtt90jx	-0.571900	*	Is someone paying you for this, or do you just sit in your room all day boiling and bubbling with hate?
t1_dsrts3u	-0.401900	*	Because we can't just go back and forth forever, this is wasting everyone's time, and my tax money at that. 
t1_dsy2wad	0.361200	*	But in the meantime since they hold so much of American bonds they are basically as wealthy as America right?

t1_dttd1me	0.381800	*	It's amazing how many people have no idea how tax brackets work.
t1_dtdu3kz	-0.638100	*	Dont forget sexism.  I know a lot of people who voted for Trump because, i'm not ready for a woman President  The sexist vote was trumps secret weapon.  And one not much discussed.

t1_dskluxg	0.000000	*	not to get too political, but think about the people who can get time off to vote, and think about the people who can't.  you might imagine which way each of these people vote.

t1_dt0uk07	0.049500	*	Both the drug industry and the hunt for (blood) diamonds are driven by profits. They are not controversial examples of where capitalism is damaging.

t1_dt0ax6t	0.273200	*	Well the problem is that is not really just political scene thats corrupt. A lot of the corporate world is corrupt too. Especially with regard to the vested energy industries (oil and gas).

t1_dsurrk3	0.000000	*	I give up. The post you replied to was about Canadian migration. That's why you're getting downvotes.
t1_dtj92xf	0.202300	*	The logic is you don't just go and make unilateral decisions to expand and create new new masses in contested areas, and then attempt to restrict who can travel there.  Make sense?

t1_dt9524r	-0.381800	*	It amazes me still how people don't understand what the PA is and Hamas, and the diffrence between Gaza/West bank. There are no missiles being fired from west bank.

t1_dt1anjf	-0.129800	*	And in parliamentary systems, the Prime Minister is little more than a figurehead. The American president is more like a fucking monarch, one that is an idiot half the time.
t1_dshkzit	0.273200	*	Well how is it untypical?
t1_dtw4hsu	0.426500	*	It won't ever matter to them, they can always afford to move somewhere else and live somewhere safe.

t1_dsl26o9	0.025800	*	Same goes for Jason Isbell. It's silly how many people comment on his FB page telling him to be less political. His stuff, back to the Drive By Truckers, was political.
t1_dsp3nwz	-0.296000	*	I bet if there were no nukes we'd be on WW6 by now. 
t1_dsxu3ei	-0.340000	*	Gun control is even stricter in much of Eastern Europe and Russia.  I don't see what your point is.  
t1_dsjnh7o	0.000000	*	How?

t1_dsilwlb	-0.636900	*	Ok, my bad, I should have specified from before Trump being a candidate was even a thing.    Also WaPo and the Guardian are notorious for being mouthpieces of the left.

t1_dt4wdix	-0.421500	*	Any substance can cause death at high enough quantity, even water. It's all about the therapeutic index i.e., how much has toxic effect divided by how much has the desired effect.
t1_dsui9em	0.204000	*	Whats so hard to understand about it?  Your tax dollars pay for WH staff to stay at Trump hotels.  Profits from Trump hotels go to Donald Trump.

t1_dtisk1t	-0.824200	*	But something being scary doesn't make it terrorism.   By this standard, sharks are all terrorists because many people are terrified by them.

t1_dtutloo	0.000000	*	The guy sent an electric Ferrari into a billion years mars orbit on the first try. You probably burned your pizza rolls this morning... just sayin bro.

t1_dtapyl5	0.722700	*	That's technically a Munich breakfast but it is delicious. 
t1_dtohb1s	0.448000	*	It doesn't, but if you don't blame every problem that happens on evil white people then a social justice warrior is obligated to call you out.

t1_dszf9z1	-0.648600	*	No, and that makes it even worse.
t1_dsi9lp6	-0.440400	*	When you literally know exactly what theyre talking about when they misspeak, and you use it as criticism, youve probably gone too far. Fortunately this applies to everyone.

t1_dtilgav	0.401900	*	I think the word you're going for is coiffage, French for hairstyling. Coiffure is French for hairstyle if you're interested.

t1_dtiun87	0.571900	*	My friend's wife loves getting cauc'd 
t1_dsf0tq1	-0.440400	*	When similar misconceptions about Americans are posted, American Redditors are quick to jump on it. It's important to be accurate, even about people we hate.
t1_dt7olwg	-0.557400	*	Let's say we made those Iphone factories illegal right now.   What would those children eat tomorow?
t1_dtv4c67	0.493900	*	I think you might have a pretty simplistic and America-centric view of the world.

t1_dta22lp	0.295100	*	Lol and...? You can be an extremist on the left. Youre aware of that, yes?  Also, I dont keep saying it. I said it once.   Stop trying to be so combative for no reason. 
t1_dtf75xs	0.043300	*	Sounds like the person I asked for a source was making things up.  You can't provide a source either because it isn't true.
t1_dt9z1bs	-0.440400	*	that's just the typical bavarian way for you. every other bundesland loathes bavaria for this type of behaviour.
t1_dt99udu	0.000000	*	I have actually 
t1_dt43k2n	0.226300	*	In general I agree. But leveraging your position in government for personal profit in my opinion is bad.  That said. I couldn't find any details on Trump personally investing in US.
t1_dtgjbbp	-0.421500	*	On personal level everyone is okay, even criminals had their behavior and intentions. But their actions speak for themselves.

t1_dst0ooc	0.493900	*	Its so you can give them out to people. Also Japan is pretty heavy on 'clean' things, and so its precieved 'cleaner' to have them wrapped that way, at least by the manufactures. 
t1_dtiyrgx	0.571900	*	I'll take the added sensitivity and pleasure though
t1_dssbm8e	0.340000	*	We have a bunch of plastic handles in our trucks that snapped because of the cold.  My tailgate needs a screw driver to open now and my dad uses pliers for e-brake release in his truck. lol
t1_dta6sct	0.177900	*	Depends on the viewpoint.  Is it sensitive to insist on a right to insult others as you please or is it sensitive to insist on a right to be treated with human dignity?
t1_dtnbfta	0.223500	*	It is nothing like that, considering that Chinese people aren't indigenous to Vancouver and they aren't under serious threat of annihilation.

t1_dtqssko	-0.690800	*	Sorry, I thought you were defending the Iranian people. They deserve to be wiped out prior to them killing gays/lesbians in America.
t1_dt9ioho	0.000000	*	So you must REALLY think Africa is a shithole.
t1_dswgziy	0.542300	*	Note that the article said global approval, not European approval. And that's ignoring the fact that European countries aren't socialist.
t1_dt7c9mi	0.175400	*	True that, nothing like the full grilled garlic cloves you get at Korean BBQs.  I eat those and also have never seen a vampire. 
t1_dswb8ns	-0.025800	*	>Dems gladly admit they want diplomacy.  Didn't Hillary want to go to war with Iran?

t1_dtk5rrr	-0.340000	*	Yeah... nobody voting trump wanted to admit it. (there's typically lots of press around the polling areas).  This was even the case for democrats, but to a much lower degree.

t1_dslggea	0.128000	*	How many other world leaders fuck around on Twitter like 4 year olds?  None, Trump is not a typical politician so why do we keep expecting him to act like one
t1_dt6yutk	0.273200	*	Ahh the tolerant left in action  
t1_dta21fk	0.524800	*	If you talk about Fxfchrer, everyone knows who is meant. Which doesn't stop us from using words like Fxfchrerschein (drivers license) oder (an)fxfchren (to lead).

t1_dspreo9	-0.421500	*	Yea, the insecurity of the religious is very telling of how it is really about tribalism, and not about belief.
t1_dsgak0s	0.636900	*	I don't know. My partner was the one who came up with the recipe. We always have coconut oil, so that's probably why. Plus I love the smell

t1_dtew7yv	0.318200	*	Im sure thats the case.
t1_dttd12u	0.594600	*	It's a broad generality, or was that actually lost upon you? You're not stupid, stop acting like you are. Use the context clues available to assess the situation.
t1_dtem2aj	0.226300	*	The consumer solutions are a farce. Feel good purify my conscience. If the meat industry didn't buy votes industry reform could.be legislated on large scale. 
t1_dttdsjj	-0.381800	*	A fine for abusing ambulance services is different to having to pay for it, and even fines arent routinely issued. Any more credible sources than Digital Spy and Babycentre?

t1_dsm64s3	0.361200	*	Did you ever get those people who sound like they're from no-where?  (I get told this, having been from nowhere and never picked up a local dialect)
t1_dsqptmn	0.440400	*	You need to get out more. America has a bunch of degenerate Trump voters in between the few good places. Almost everywhere in America is the same. 
t1_dt5456d	-0.190100	*	I've been out of high school for 20 years but yes. I knew several people who did heroin when I was in high school.

t1_dtspvw2	-0.571900	*	The problem is you're getting your nose in someone else's business. Russia is bad for doing this but it's aok for you to try to punish someone for thoughtcrime?

t1_dslbwvz	-0.636900	*	>it's pretty stupid  If that were the case people wouldn't be buying in. This is the height of social engineering and the wet dream of Edward bernays. Calculated,  and anything but stupid.

t1_dt7yyrf	0.746900	*	That little jab on the right is unnecessary and not productive, but I don't think you can say its a bipartisan issue when one side is literally favoring coal compared to solar energy.
t1_dt1b9sl	-0.373600	*	What? The US state is way older than China's state. I have no idea what you're trying to say. Is a billion people impossible to govern democratically?

t1_dtkuhkm	-0.029900	*	I mean, yeah, it shouldn't shock you. But people then turn around and complain about how these poorly educated people are ruining antibiotics for the entire planet. 
t1_dtkfheg	-0.229700	*	>aren't widespread and accepted by the majority of American society  Agreed. My only point is that this is a poor justification for any medical procedure on someone too young to consent.
t1_dszp623	0.476700	*	Oh but you do, because you know the great doom of the U.S. military is going to pounce on China shortly.
t1_dtbowf0	-0.726900	*	If we ever needed the wit and wisdom of George Carlin, it is now. He just hated bullies and liers, and there's no worse example of that than Trump. 
t1_dsuv9dh	0.735100	*	Not better, just an observation. Feel free to refute it.
t1_dsuqt16	0.000000	*	You asked a question, I answered it. Where did I say Haiti had a high standard of living? The person you're replying to was talking about Canada.
t1_dtcqv59	0.000000	*	Did you just compare Jewish religious garb to the KKKs uniform?   Thats a stretch, even for the Internet.

t1_dshrrc9	-0.169500	*	America is not making that impression. Everyone is aware of how common major powers interfere. Trump talks openly about it.   
t1_dtf4y65	0.000000	*	those were all Jewish and Christian traditions before anyone else adopted them. The Bible even says stone any woman in public who isn't a virgin on her night of marriage.

t1_dsjvw00	-0.859100	*	How is it a joke when his previous comment was attacking someone for being a prisoner of war?  That makes no sense.  Okay Trump whisperer. It was a 'joke'.
t1_dtw1tdo	0.128000	*	Dogs exist because of eugenics alone. Natural eugenics of course. But not human eugenics. We have demonstrated a lack of ability of doing natures job.

t1_dtrt51q	0.401900	*	You would risk losing your job/good standing with your employer for a person you never met? You must have a nice fall back plan or a rich family.
t1_dsi5cg4	-0.617000	*	They don't build new B-52s, they just reskin it occasionally and rebuild broken engines and worn parts.

t1_dswcola	-0.177900	*	Yeah, that might be an understatement. I'd say it's a reason why this program is a terrible idea that you should stop right now. :p

t1_dszp0bd	0.440400	*	You are right in general as for this particular case, Japan's present issue is that its fertility decreases too quickly and does not give the society and the economy time to cope with it effectively.
t1_dtjcd48	-0.790600	*	Slavery was tradition. No votes for women was tradition, monarchy rule was a tradition. Got rid of those though

t1_dtkx782	-0.836000	*	Do you think we should have to?  This is not the consumer's job. Its the governments of the world who need to pull their head from ass and make actual regulation on corporations run by blind greed.

t1_dttjq2v	-0.102700	*	There are still deductibles, co-pays, fees, etc. Even those of us with insurance pay quite a bit of money out of pocket. 
t1_dt2tqmw	0.614600	*	Maybe a lot of Chinese people have learned to make due under their crappy regime, but there's a reason why so many rich Chinese families are clamoring to send their kids to school here in the U.S. 
t1_dseet95	0.421500	*	Yeah a military Coup would never happen. Youre more likely to have the senate invite Trump to the hill and them stabbing him in the Rotunda than a military coup happening. 
t1_dsonr3e	-0.421500	*	The suez was more about trade than about security. Those nations needed the trade as it was post-war economy.   Seriously every comment you make is bad history

t1_dtgja46	0.718100	*	Is there anything stopping you from forming your own party or getting involved in a grass roots movement? How can you expect change to occur if everyone else like you has just decided to not bother? 
t1_dsm2uq5	0.812600	*	you would get the best care in the world and for most people insurance isn't an issue. 
t1_dsk21di	-0.539800	*	So you go to a place known for Nazis and racisms because liberals call people Nazis and racists.  Why are you so easily controlled by what other people do?   That's sad.

t1_dso6m79	0.296000	*	Yep. And more people voted for Hillary. 
t1_dswkhke	0.202300	*	Indeed, they neglected to make themselves clear at first, and enacted a backwards inclusion to make things more obviously clear. 
t1_dt65693	0.458800	*	I went to Google and typed in Kim Jong cat. :)
t1_dtbyobl	-0.510600	*	Half the shit in this comment chain is just anti-war erotica.   >Run over kids.  >Live with that.  >Just following orders.  This shit was basically greentext lmao.

t1_dsoaq0w	0.585900	*	Yeah, pretty stupid for someone to expect Americans to cater to every little international whim. I'm one of the lucky ones I guess.
t1_dt2l6q7	-0.458800	*	Godwins law just attacked Reddits law.   Godwins law: In online discussions the probability something will be compared to Hitler grows closer to 1. 
t1_dt7catk	-0.655300	*	> Are you at all familiar with North Korea  Are you? Or do you just think it will be no big deal to take in 25 million starving brainwashed refugees, who can't even tell what a lie is?

t1_dt3klkh	0.000000	*	They're free to leave whenever they want to. Calling them concentration camps is stupid and diminishes the atrocities of the Germans and colonial Brits.
t1_dtq5uzt	0.000000	*	He wants fewer layers of government, which would mean more responsibility for fewer people. Not exactly a dictatorship, but i guess thats where u/qtx is coming from.

t1_dsm2sef	0.709600	*	I'd say it was Hillary's backroom deals in the DNC (corruption) that created the dumpster fire that is the Trump Presidency - fairly confident Bernie would have won against Donny Tiny-hands.

t1_dt7dm2v	0.822500	*	I don't see that as a smirk, I see that as amusement and surprise that such a brash approach by Trump actually fielded great results.  But we'll just have to agree to disagree.
t1_dt6ehlv	-0.813200	*	Calling gay marriage of the devil isn't exactly tolerating. Hiding kid raping priest from the law, now that is tolerating.. ;) 
t1_dswly5t	0.102700	*	My parents don't think that smoking and drinking is moral. Should they also be exempt from any sort of government assistance?

t1_dtkti0r	-0.964000	*	A solution exists,  but countries would rather placate China than do it.   So the root of the problem is that the world doesn't actually care about genocide, so terrorism is the only way to fight it.

t1_dsifx00	-0.831600	*	Oh man, the worst is when somebody says it was better in the 90's during Miloevi, and I remember it. It was horrible, then a bit worse. 
t1_dtgik6z	-0.676900	*	Yes. My 1 vote would not have made a difference and I'm not sure that the outcome is as doom and gloom as people make out.

t1_dsxj6wp	-0.381800	*	You wrote:     >is nearly identical to a newborn baby, and can survive out of the womb?          That is an emergency C-Section, *not* an abortion.

t1_dsd9e6b	-0.401900	*	They would be stupid if they were simply unable to comprehend the risks. Knowing the potential consecuences, and deciding to make a statement willingly sacrifying their safety is different.
t1_dt2ry5i	-0.153100	*	I think the percentage you're referring to is irreligious, aka no religion. BC is more irreligious than Alberta, but Alberta is the second most irreligious province.

t1_dsjvsni	-0.064400	*	Just checking, are you arguing that it's just as likely Obama said things like this, but senators/the media didn't throw him under the bus?
t1_dtnnlqn	0.025800	*	You can compare radiation levels received by people (and other parts of the environment if you like). That is what ultimately matters.

t1_dsg0f68	-0.571900	*	Personally I think representative democracy is the problem.  The whole system needs to be torn down and replaced.
t1_dtvm4fd	-0.373600	*	Except developing countries refused to participate if such requirements were implemented..  How do you think it ended up as it is in the first place??
t1_dtas24y	-0.440400	*	Thats not an individual case of a man killing himself and like I said its not much higher than western countries.
t1_dsyr615	0.000000	*	Theoretically, if the wind was moving in mach 1, the plane would fly mach 1 + it's own speed.

t1_dsq3abh	0.077200	*	I think your assumption you will win is a bad assumption.  
t1_dszf8ze	0.636900	*	Its the truth, he did meet them. Are we not to mention because it has been used to much or for whatever reason some find it cringe worthy? 
t1_dtb9cxj	-0.725100	*	I mean in the villages we even treat the refugees fairly. So if the police treats her worse than these, she really have fucked up.  
t1_dsllnvy	0.510600	*	Last I checked that's all heavily regulated in the US, even alcohol, quite the opposite of a free market.
t1_dtq0ajz	0.577300	*	Yes I understand all that, if she did OD he didn't murder her. You just seem to be overlooking the part where he hacked the body up and scattered it around the streets.

t1_dt2mtdz	0.000000	*	The guy who posted claims to be an atheist - he gets to decide who is part of an organized religion?
t1_dse0vju	0.381800	*	Aaand that's why I'm against lowering corporate taxes. The rich will just label their personal expenses as corporate.

t1_dsk2gix	0.258400	*	Did not deny =/= confirmed.
t1_dt614z3	-0.568200	*	The point is FEMA gave no warning nor backed up their decision and everyone was left up in the air.
t1_dslx8cx	0.836000	*	Awesome if you like being robbed at gunpoint.  Fair point

t1_dskzbzj	0.273200	*	How are we only 25% of the way through this nightmare? It feels like it will never end.   If Democrats find a way to screw up the next election I give up. 
t1_dstserd	-0.153100	*	Oh no Im aware of the history, but some historians think it was commissioned by the brother of William and completed by English nuns as opposed to the Normans.

t1_dt0ar60	-0.933100	*	There's theft, but almost none of it by starving people. Envy and spite are strong motivators, and one does not have to be desperate for survival to be a criminal.
t1_dt1v27g	0.227100	*	I know it's easier said than done, but don't let others success or luck of the cards beat you down man. I may not much money, but I have a life.
t1_dsy6jkc	0.936200	*	Yeah, but the mega-corporations producing the fertilizer aren't going to want their pocket senators/reps voting for stuff like that. It's in their best interest to sell as much fertilizer as possible.
t1_dtrv9yp	0.556200	*	> *Next you know they will try to claim feta cheese and anal sex!*  Slow down there Skippy. A shit-ton of college co-eds are going to voice strong objections to that last bit.
t1_dt1ux98	0.846200	*	It really depends but Id say working public transport is a bigger factor although the better denser zoning affects that as well. Gas prices as well, many factors...
t1_dtg7fse	-0.685200	*	I hate avocados and still can't afford to move out of my six person flat. Where's my house deposit??!!
t1_dsiofkh	-0.273200	*	I think they're calling you ignorant regardless of any assumptions.  At least that's how it kind of reads to me, anyway.

t1_dsjbusx	0.000000	*	If we're getting a populist crank, I'd much rather it was Corbyn than either of the other two you mentioned. 
t1_dt2m1xy	0.000000	*	Which, in turn, isn't all that green. The Scandinavian explorers of the past were idiots when it came to naming their findings. 
t1_dtu91dc	-0.025800	*	What it does to help the recovery is amazing enough. There is no need for the cure cancer hype.
t1_dsmfqob	-0.340000	*	Ahh yes because Switzerland only has 1 person who writes laws and the whole world will abide by these laws. What a silly, he should have written a law that says no nuclear war, okay? 
t1_dslz7k9	0.000000	*	'Not from an American'
t1_dteb48b	0.381800	*	It really has been diminished. Even Las Vegas is very corporate now. The rest of prohibition keeps a lot of cartels alive, end it and you'll see the end of many cartels, gangs and mafias.
t1_dsk463x	0.000000	*	My guess is sacks and sacks of cash money
t1_dt1cx5e	0.000000	*	I dunno how to ask this without it sounding judgey but that's not the intent.  How come you're a contractor and not a government employee?
t1_dsusxyk	-0.077200	*	If the person signing off on it could shut the fuck up about it and get off Twitter youd have a better point, but hes there every day muddying the water.

t1_dt9ipo1	0.340000	*	It's politically easier to absorb the Norths program than turn the last screw on their own.
t1_dtwhojs	0.624900	*	Trumps supporters will deflect anything he says thats pretty much universally reviled as sarcastic.   Hes like the living embodiment of Poes Law and its frankly getting exhausting. 
t1_dt8n0g7	-0.359700	*	So no examples?
t1_dtoz051	0.612400	*	How do you not understand what I meant?  When I say my government or my country I'm not saying I own the shit.  
t1_dtozek2	0.000000	*	I never said they do
t1_dskc0vc	0.273200	*	Except the northern line Battersea extension and Nine Elms a little further away and more I think. If anything the area is finally getting a well deserved rejuvination.
t1_dsguhgv	0.835800	*	There are 22 Arab Nations. 2 of then who are neighbors have made peace with Israel. They do not smuggle weapons or allow weapons to be smuggled. 
t1_dsesywz	0.000000	*	**If I were**
t1_dtv3oy8	0.421500	*	Another fallacy is to reason through things as though we live in a pre-Trump POTUS United States.   I'd say all bets are off on this shitshow.
t1_dtoylpe	0.000000	*	It's the modern condition.

t1_dt0755l	0.000000	*	I've been following Norway's recent environmental movements in the news and am looking at more facts than just those in the article. Why even make this comment?
t1_dsjgo82	-0.226300	*	Even though they are the second largest, they still only represent ~14% of the voting demographic.   People seem to forget that a lot.
t1_dtl5sw8	0.612400	*	That's dreadfully complicated, though, compared to how easy and accurate breathalyzers are.  *edit* oh, saliva tests are better than I thought, thanks u/therestruth
t1_dsdnzlh	0.000000	*	Does Donald *know* his name was changed?  If so, then he is *knowingly* blasting someone who had their name changed while also *knowingly* having a changed name. How is that not hypoctitical?
t1_dt9pkhu	0.085900	*	Yeah obviously not, that narrative has been pushed so hard and you just ate it up. They are palpably different.

t1_dswt1sy	0.790600	*	I'm sure there's many Labour opponents who'd think the same for Jacinda. Fast rising politicians typically aren't known to be truly nice people.

t1_dtnz5t1	-0.585900	*	I mean, if you're going to strawman people in ways that make it easy to mock you, I'm going to take the low-hanging fruit. If you've got a problem with that, I suggest you stop strawmanning.
t1_dswvcvm	-0.675300	*	Do you know Haitians personally that aren't good people?   Or is there something specific about their culture that you dislike?   What are you trying to say here?

t1_dtoobmy	0.454900	*	The KKK was a conservative response to the reconstruction plan for the South.   It was just a bunch of confederate veterans who thought they deserved welfare more than freed slaves. 
t1_dspogm0	-0.584900	*	Fucking fuck
t1_dsnvwtd	0.000000	*	What code are you going to execute if you can't access WAN from the network?  Most you can do is wipe all connected drives
t1_dtshyd1	-0.296000	*	Pretty sure Amazon can't sell that if its bad for people to eat...   Regardless, 100% of people eating refined or unrefined palm oil will probably die one day. 
t1_dshpbo0	0.000000	*	What's false? the one where Trump owes them 130 million?

t1_dtnaeuz	0.718400	*	Lol you didn't know the word *invigilation*? I suggest going back to school, friend.
t1_dsdisv2	-0.612400	*	I'd prefer to see the death penalty abolished.  There are better ways of removing these people from society instead of the absolute.
t1_dtqcvg1	0.000000	*	I thought I was the only one. Where do we sign up to try lab burgers?
t1_dttg97t	0.165500	*	But the public option would be too good and drive away all the competition. We can't have the superior product beat inferior products. How is that honoring capitalism? /s
t1_dt1goez	0.000000	*	The military currently isn't 
t1_dspj4ec	-0.226300	*	I was just quoting star wars man....  That said I'm from Russia and am firmly in the Yes Mr Putin camp so what you said probably applies to me anyway.
t1_dsm4g1t	0.000000	*	What is that supposed to mean? 
t1_dsk80x5	0.458800	*	I am more a [Shakespearean](http://nfs.sparknotes.com/hamlet/page_180.html) kind of guy :)
t1_dtefwem	-0.566100	*	How does that disprove anything I said?   I already said he is alleged to have abused 14 year olds.  ...Unless you *still* don't know what a paedophile is even after I told you to look it up?
t1_dsfkj74	0.115400	*	Okay I know that but what's the connection to the Olympics?
t1_dtktg56	0.179600	*	> shared responsibility for one's community and the general welfare of all citizens.  That's very vague, it can mean anything that gov wants.
t1_dssb4u3	0.440400	*	As a white person I am filled with assurance following this unsourced claim and knowing nothing about the region or its centuries of conflict I am satisfied in upvoting this comment.
t1_dsetxg2	0.440400	*	I think it's better to have a cow, man.
t1_dsirlut	-0.318200	*	yeah, letting the majority of the population decide the result? What a horrible system that would be.

t1_dt0jut4	-0.025800	*	Well why pressure the SPD then?
t1_dsju2zo	0.273200	*	Because he's on CNN.  If a CNN anchor walked on water, certain media and political figures and their followers would blast them for not being able to swim (to paraphrase Clinton)
t1_dtxly4e	0.273200	*	Poor Charlotte. Personally, I thought her character might be gay, thus her not being overly enamoured with the idea of marrying for love. 
t1_dsm8n9a	0.318200	*	His username sure checks out.
t1_dt2m5wm	-0.440400	*	Thats problematic though. There are issues with interpretation when you ask what you intend to be the same question using different wording.
t1_dswpc5f	-0.755600	*	Not really Trudeau's biggest fan myself but I have zero problem with him removing government funding from anti-choice jerks that hang around women's clinics with their weird gore porn. 
t1_dt228y8	-0.102700	*	Those jobs in the city pay a lot more
t1_dt5yfmy	0.913600	*	I respect your observations but what does having good priorities have to do with freedom?
t1_dtw2daf	0.421500	*	Yup, I know . I was just pointing out a very common sentiment among Muslim leaders and intellects during the 1930s and 1940s.
t1_dt5q8oe	0.000000	*	Not gonna respond to that? 
t1_dsxmap2	0.000000	*	In n Out does their own sourcing and distribution.  If you're spending $3 on lunch, it's the way to go.

t1_dsy3ylq	0.340000	*	research as in reading a short article and taking everything in it at face value as the definitive story? le reddit army saves the world with due diligence again....
t1_dtnussa	-0.019100	*	What you 'think' or how you 'feel' is irrelevant.  Your truthiness doesn't matter at all.
t1_dsk7k6s	0.458800	*	I gave you the benefit of the doubt:) 
t1_dsnu1o7	0.000000	*	And Ill ask you. Did I claim to? Or did I point out that a sample size is a factional percentage representative of a whole?
t1_dsjztzf	0.000000	*	I'll take 'Shithole Countries' for $200, Alex.
t1_dsmqlrz	0.000000	*	Jerry Brown, D governor of California is the DEFINITION of crony capitalism.  You are drinking the left kool-aid if you think it is a right-wing thing.
t1_dt8x5f6	0.000000	*	It really is not though...
t1_dt8v1w4	0.659700	*	Anyone 2 steps removed from the old guard  anyone who doesn't equate Russia with Soviets.  Every single person I know in real life, all admire Putin.  There are fan clubs with millions of members.
t1_dshq562	-0.294200	*	And you know what? Forget the country!
t1_dthd34m	0.000000	*	Oh shush
t1_dtij5rf	0.624900	*	At this point I'm surprised he hasn't claimed that they were Russian. He's pretty much claimed everything else. 
t1_dsnds3u	0.842800	*	Well with North Korea regularly testing more and more reliable and powerful ballistic missiles, I personally think they'd be foolish not to do tests like this honestly.
t1_dskmaj8	0.726900	*	I truly hope Prime Minister Solberg publicly asks Trump why any Norwegian would want to immigrate to the shithole US. 
t1_dth94sw	0.187400	*	Yes, Ukraine, but you'll still go on telling falsehoods. It won't matter what I say. 
t1_dtjbwwh	-0.388700	*	Right, some religions use psychedelic drugs...but that never stopped the US DOJ and the DEA from banning them and sending people off to prison though.
t1_dtanlyz	0.077200	*	No, and that's not what I said.  I feel like you're being intentionally obtuse.  Trump Receives Mixed Reception at Davos would have been a more accurate headline.
t1_dsgfo9g	-0.659700	*	Right. I'm fucked up.
t1_dshs3bo	-0.361200	*	try an actual argument
t1_dtfphh1	0.000000	*	But the federal government does.   So does the military. 
t1_dsphns3	0.618700	*	I have a strong dislike of Catholicism (oddly, all four grandparents were Catholics), but I do acknowledge the charity the Church does compared to other denominations.    Looking at you Mormons ;/

t1_dsith8o	0.757900	*	Well, marriage at 15 is legal in the united kingdom as well, if I remember correctly.
t1_dswr8r4	-0.615900	*	Doesn't that seem pretty messed up to you, that a person doesn't have the right to decide what happens to their body?
t1_dskut98	-0.019100	*	You can't lose the popular vote. Its nothing more than a statistic and not the goal of the competition. That 3 million is also less than .3% of the country.
t1_dtpkz2c	-0.202300	*	Have you never  watched Fox News?  People thought she  committed email treason.

t1_dstbg84	-0.648600	*	Whistleblowers don't go to Moscow with state secrets. That is called defection and treason.
t1_dt6f3ej	-0.318200	*	Morons with YouTube channels.
t1_dssxpfm	0.557400	*	Unfortunately, a lot of people do such things, but not all of them. It's just people who want to get to a better life, and this is the quickest way to do so.
t1_dstwlts	0.000000	*	You mean Dokdo?
t1_dt41dxt	0.658800	*	Ok, thanks!

t1_dtbtra3	0.077200	*	Thats the point though. You dont have free speech if you can be penalized for using offensive words.
t1_dtqt81h	0.497300	*	I'm asking why you don't hold the US to the same standards, because you're obviously not boycotting US companies, because you're on reddit.  Why don't you boycott all US companies?
t1_dt0wen1	0.000000	*	But you are them, you'll be invading yourself. *sigh* America never learns. 
t1_dsecqhw	0.000000	*	So edgy you just couldnt resist. 
t1_dt2e1u4	0.596500	*	So you've admitted that it's in effect, just that you're assuming those shifty folks in the neighboring country will go back on their agreement?
t1_dsupbdb	0.784500	*	Yes, it clearly needs a proper investigation, much like everything else Scientology does.
t1_dtvsalr	0.000000	*	People eat pork and dog, so those would be my guess.
t1_dt3vzyg	-0.200600	*	Yeah this concept is really hard for these people in this thread to grasp for some odd reason. Probably been reading too much buzzfeed.

t1_dto6srg	-0.788300	*	How would this friendlyness even work in cities? You can't greet everybody that's out on the street. You meet thousands of people everyday so you just filter them out. It would get exhausting as fuck
t1_dt7erpl	-0.571900	*	And that's what we call wilful ignorance. I can avoid looking at the evidence, therefore evidence doesn't exist.
t1_dtnb1m7	0.609600	*	I'm all in favor of a new leftist savior. Bernie is in favor of the drone wars. We could do so much better.

t1_dsusgul	0.000000	*	Any government should serve its people.  A government that sacrifices its people to serve others is tyrannical, whether that's the elites, or a foreign nation.
t1_dt5w1hn	0.622200	*	Not worthless, but very low value unless you get a lot of them. Certain massive karmawhores have gotten jobs in PR or marketing due to their Reddit portfolio of their ability to make things go viral
t1_dtoe7vt	0.401900	*	They were prepared to burn the North and retreat to the Alps.
t1_dsue3ev	0.401900	*	I just thought it was interesting. 
t1_dsdwtge	0.401900	*	Common Dreams is a progressive outlet. Whom else is their to ascribe responsibility?

t1_dsyca6j	0.077200	*	Who didnt want to bang hot chicks at 12?
t1_dt2ksfe	0.636100	*	Considering that only 26.3% of americans voted for trump, I wouldnt say that 33% is inconsequential, and most certainly not virtually non-existent.  Virtually non-existent is, like, 0.3%.  
t1_dt6fy2a	0.077200	*	He also undid a lot of what JP2 did with regards to Vatican II, especially when it came to the poor. He was very anti-Liberation Theology. Francis is a Jesuit, an order rooted in social justice. 
t1_dsiand0	0.094600	*	Dude.... Our boarder guards are definitely not as nice as the American ones 
t1_dtm36b6	0.765000	*	You remind me of my late grandfather. He had several strokes that affected the way he walked, yet he always made fun of himself. He loved being called Frankenstein.

t1_dtz554l	-0.340000	*	What do you mean unfortunately? 
t1_dtwprag	0.760600	*	Tbh thats not a fair assessment. I met plenty of Trump supporting Israelis who knew better than to support Netanyahu

t1_dsgloen	-0.205700	*	Capitalism is less than 500 years old. If you redefine all economic relationships before 1500 as capitalist (or proto- capitalist) it's not surprising capitalism looks inevitable.

t1_dskx5rm	0.000000	*	Go on ...
t1_dtpp8at	-0.202300	*	But the fascism part of it doesnt necessarily have to do with economic system. It just so happens if you control every aspect of the economy its easier to be fascist.

t1_dt6gxth	0.000000	*	Where does it say surveillance started in 2005?
t1_dtojnwu	0.540800	*	> they didnt get killed because they were black  No? Well, then it must have been because they were putting cream in their carbonara and coincidentally they all happened to be black.
t1_dsmjnsk	-0.580300	*	Source?  And how could it be a global threat? Neither Clinton holds a position of power. 
t1_dsiu6as	0.000000	*	Were they targeting civilians in those cases?  What was Trump's reason, did he have a fallout with the girl beforehand and wanted her gone?
t1_dtunkdy	0.225900	*	Why?  ... because politicians like to keep their options open since they're not sure if one of their own will be the one subpoenaed? 
t1_dtbv5ot	-0.599400	*	Only in times of war. And now its men AND women. 
t1_dtvhons	0.680800	*	These kind of thoughts led to more than 25 years of vegetarianism. I didn't and still don't need meat or fish to stay healthy so my conscience got the better of my nature.

t1_dstgej9	-0.102700	*	Ok, try moving to north Korea and living there for a week, look for a job, try to criticize the government there. See how your world outlook will change.
t1_dtn2yqp	0.790600	*	That would be great. Always good to hear both sides.

t1_dttmiah	-0.807400	*	Thats exactly what Im saying is awful. The fact that they mutilate her and video her and then have guys just stepping on her dead body. Quite dishonorable if you ask me.

t1_dskinuy	-0.862500	*	It bothers you because it was and is a disgusting and terrible thing to say and think.  Only an awful human being would act like that.  That's why it bothers you.

t1_dszscge	-0.019100	*	Hey man, the amount of anime doesn't matter. It's all about the person's mental state (or just too much curiosity without substance). 
t1_dtmnbou	0.000000	*	The point goes both ways. One country can't decide the entirety of the EU's actions. So both posts are bogus.

t1_dtpszag	-0.857700	*	Am I a criminal? The world knows I'm not a criminal. What are they trying to put me in jail for? You've lost common sense in this society because of religious fanaticism and dogma.
t1_dsq2itx	-0.718400	*	I'm pretty sure Lincoln was white, along with a vast majority of the people that died fighting for equality.  The Klan murdered lots of white people too.  Are you just trying to be dense on purpose?

t1_dssqds1	0.577000	*	Judging by your other comments on this post I'm starting to think you actually support government ideas. I'll not argue with you about things corrupt people on the government say every. Single. Day.

t1_dt0g8ap	-0.700300	*	The issue is that it is public flogging before a screaming crowd.   How would you feel if your local schools took up corporal punishment and performed it in front of the entire student body?

t1_dti4fwd	0.466000	*	The party that is now recognized and tied to the GOP. You mean that party? Did you forget that part? Yet again? Brush up on your history bud. Youre looking like a complete ass. 
t1_dtp3zfi	-0.769100	*	Don't you find it curious that no man would ever choose to be completely covered up by niqab? Isn't that evidence that they don't simply choose to wear it, but are forced or pressured to?

t1_dsuv1ib	-0.585900	*	This denies the fact that we live in a global economy. Trying to create a bubble makes us worse off economically.

t1_dslwmg1	-0.153100	*	Medium well? Why don't you just walk back in the kitchen and piss in the mashed potatos.   Everyone knows that monkey brains are served raw on the half skull.
t1_dslx54p	0.012900	*	Calling people out for skin colour and their accent are two different things.  You have a twang, you ought to know this shit pretty well.

t1_dsvgkds	-0.474800	*	Men have more genotype variance because they're more prone to mutations, but I could see how that in turn would cause more risk taking behaviour.

t1_dslvzh8	0.757900	*	This thread is hilarious. People need to come down to South Africa and get an eye opening about how decent the living conditions are. I live in KZN and it's amazing here.

t1_dshf0id	-0.415700	*	> You can just say Large double double and the worker will know exactly what you want.  At damn near any coffee shop in Canada. That's not Timmies exclusive. That's part of the national lexicon now.

t1_dt9zjq1	-0.139600	*	Just because you have a bachelor in PolSci, you don't get to slander a domain. Maybe you didn't give two shits about your college subject, and of course you'll speak badly of it then.

t1_dt8w7vq	-0.251400	*	I never said racism was dead. 
t1_dtp2mps	-0.177900	*	In your country perhaps. In mine, that distinction is a layman's one and there is no legal distinction between them.

t1_dtm0qh7	0.151300	*	Salvia is a completely different drug that's a much more intense hallucinogen. You're thinking of cannabis sativa, one of the two main species of the genus cannabis along with cannabis indica.

t1_dsml1a7	0.000000	*	I'm not judging based on hypothetical crimes. A mayor ordering the dispersion of an unruly crowd wouldn't  be judging based on hypothetical crimes either, right? It's just logical.
t1_dtgi3jh	0.361200	*	Sounds like a job for Bill Browder
t1_dshsq74	-0.296000	*	We also don't know Russias real total either. Most of the US ones are 3rd world countries, some that didn't even have elections. There's no information here on Russias behavior in the 3rd world.

t1_dttc6cp	0.076200	*	Of course - it was a comic reflection about how not wanting to pay taxes had a much deeper cultural status in the American psyche than in the British one. It wasn't meant to be taken literally. 
t1_dtahhmw	0.000000	*	Im all for you being allowed to say it. Its Germany that has an issue with your speech.

t1_dsth1px	-0.205700	*	Again, they did not agreed that Israel could colonize any part of the OPT under its administration. Becoming a territory's manager doesn't make you its owner.

t1_dtulun9	0.599400	*	Huh. Well, that IS unexpected, then. Do you have a source for the charity thing?
t1_dsznr89	0.038700	*	Or you know you could have elaborated on your arguments :) but I guess you cant. 
t1_dtxg6bj	-0.401900	*	A president dying in the middle of his term because his body is fucked up by smoking and drinking could also serve as an interesting reality Czech.

t1_dt7r2bx	0.000000	*	I imagine he has relatives over there still. The subject is closer to him than to a lot of people. I guess his personal opinion takes a back seat to the formal stance of the Government. 
t1_dsmz9y8	-0.690800	*	Theyve actually caused a problem in the states.   The left is in a real pickle.  Theyve been deemed offensive to women who dont have vaginas.

t1_dspphcg	0.754800	*	I'm American. Iraq was a colonial adventure that did nothing but kill hundreds of thousands of people and hand the country over to Iran. It was stupid ethically and strategically. 
t1_dt65a0p	0.000000	*	North Africa, but I see your point.
t1_dsmhd5q	0.340000	*	I was giving an extreme example so my point would come across. I wasn't saying they were equivalent.

t1_dtdxoqq	0.757900	*	Your response was yes they are. how is that original or continuing the conversation? You've resorted to responding like a toddler.
t1_dsk1gjx	-0.348400	*	If you outlaw weapons, only the outlaws will have weapons. Then the situation is even worse...  It's oft repeated but no less true.

t1_dt2lddk	-0.373600	*	Why? Because corporations raise their prices so much? But then they wouldn't be making any sales, so obviously they'd keep prices lower.  This is economics 101, dude.
t1_dtn2xpm	-0.476700	*	Neither, the whole story is rubbish. Shady fake news website reporting on something the french foreign minister said that isn't reported anywhere else.

t1_dszjlqj	0.440400	*	His point was that his situation is not similar to the holocaust whatsoever. Nobody called it a magical safe space. Just some whiny little man comparing his situation to genocide.

t1_dtbdem7	-0.871200	*	It really doesn't sound like a long war is the solution if the military and federal police are wracked with corruption. In fact, has the violence improved at all since the war on drugs began?

t1_dsmxgwt	0.371600	*	Sure, I was just pointing out the flaw in your logic. It's a nice sentiment but logically doesn't really mean anything.
t1_dtggx5x	0.477700	*	Me: Shouldn't women be able to get maternal leave?  You: Don't worry about gender.  GOP: Okay, let's take it from them.

t1_dtbkkil	0.757900	*	Unless I misunderstood your point, it was that this action promotes an American military presence on the Russian border.      In all honesty if my comment is misguided feel free to tell me why.
t1_dsm0a19	-0.757900	*	China is a country with a brutal history with Japan. If you mistake a person from china as Japanese, depending on where they are from and their age, you might be getting smacked over it.
t1_dsyh9ic	0.147600	*	That's fine, I don't want you here anyway.
t1_dt4h759	-0.361200	*	The USA isn't now considering Iraq as part of their territory.  Your comparison sucks.
t1_dtgslzv	0.000000	*	Have you seen any of the videos of these trips? The lions walk right up to your vehicle. 
t1_dtvpai7	-0.381800	*	I am going to have to disagree with you. Not only do the animals get eaten(by law), the money paid by the hunter is used for conservation.
t1_dtrkvx9	0.296000	*	Yeah, that guy probably only goes to /r/LateStageCapitalism or something to get his numbers. 
t1_dtmsrp0	0.000000	*	metro/dailymail same company dmg group
t1_dsr0ntb	0.000000	*	I assume he's talking about historical places pertaining to the US, not North America. US is formally less than 300 years old.
t1_dsjxsms	-0.128000	*	That's the point you dummy. It's such an easy and stupid comment 
t1_dsqjb1t	-0.599400	*	> For fake crimes, probably even a small amount would be considered a huge fraction, since most people do not expect people to make such fake allegations.   What kind of fucking logic is this? 
t1_dsv2045	0.000000	*	Or revitalized coal?
t1_dtd79ec	-0.512200	*	I don't agree with that at all, no.
t1_dszezd6	0.421500	*	I just remembered I made a snapchat video with them while at the bar. Here's [proof](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhvBk1OF1TE&feature=youtu.be) lol.

t1_dtdc4xa	-0.571900	*	It's a crude gesture over there. Iirc it's the equivalent of calling someone an arsehole.
t1_dtie9in	0.381800	*	Yeah I know what you mean. But even when he overreaches, the isolated segments are interesting in their own right.
t1_dt9vrq8	0.273200	*	Agreed fam.
t1_dsrr7cd	0.440400	*	Never said it was ?  Just said I personally prioritize other things. Idc if it is a single penny it in my mind could be better spent in my mind.

t1_dsurlxh	-0.784500	*	I urge you to take some college level economics classes and actually pay attention. You will learn the difference between organic inflation and forced inflation. Organic inflation isnt a bad thing. 
t1_dtivskl	-0.361200	*	Well shit then I guess it's settled then. /u/Homomorphallism has spoken.   
t1_dsyhegh	-0.614200	*	So stop giving subsidies to farmers who abuse these chemicals and/or don't properly control runoff.
t1_dsih5xl	0.594800	*	Don't forget: the aca is different from obamacare. We've seen that one a ton. Especially since trump paid lip service to universal health care a few times.

t1_dswpuik	-0.879100	*	> People who really want a gun will get a gun, so why ban them?  literally the argument Republicans use in the US all the time.

t1_dsq01lg	-0.736500	*	I guess with taxes, Im not sure though I never supported ir anyway.  The tuition fees should be reduced though, it is really unacceptable what they charge
t1_dtm2u19	0.458800	*	If you live in a first world country the likelyhood you reach 120 is probably better than it has ever been at any point before.
t1_dsgj5xo	0.694800	*	What do you mean didn't use the help of government? Using governments to get an advantage is perfectly fine capitalistic behaviour.
t1_dt75g4y	-0.353500	*	Most of that tax is spent on unnecessary things like bureaucrats salaries. So it is stealing. Figure it out
t1_dsdnh35	-0.283700	*	But Trump is a conman, if he thought he could profit by losing I think he'd do it.  ... but I don't know, he's crazy, trying to read into his motives is probably futile. 
t1_dtvu0qk	-0.891000	*	> Ben Shapiro is possibly the worst source for anything ever. He speaks literal shit nearly 100% of the time.   Proceeds to link a dirty looking hipster doing a Youtube blog.
t1_dslv209	-0.318200	*	White males are victims, get over it.
t1_dt7znzc	0.432900	*	> And what is with tuff like this?   It gets covered up has the mine moves past and turned back into usable land?
t1_dtx3b3p	0.000000	*	China would charge for passage through the SCS. All your Hello Kitty backpacks would cost more.

t1_dt707df	0.000000	*	Did you just have a stroke?
t1_dt4snh8	0.123900	*	IDK how it works with foreigners/expats, but you have to keep in mind that a liability insurance is mandated by law for dutch citizens, just like our health insurance.
t1_dsmclyy	0.251600	*	It's almost like people get triaged and get priority based on the seriousness of the injury/illness...
t1_dsie209	-0.510600	*	>When you start defending a country by comparing it to failed states.
t1_dskniap	0.296000	*	lolno  We have state-subsidized Vitamin D supplements for that.

t1_dtk8l19	0.557400	*	You made me laugh harder than I should have, take this upvote
t1_dtq49xq	0.673000	*	Spoken like a liberal. So whats the better option? Sit around and demand someone pays your way?
t1_dtsvusd	-0.690800	*	Also a reminder that a terrorist group holds a majority in the palestinian government.
t1_dtm983r	0.000000	*	It doesn't suggest false. That's what it doesn't suggest.
t1_dsv0kbc	0.807400	*	Okay, sure, yeah. But just think about all those Haitian immigrants trying to better their lives. 
t1_dt9zj25	0.526700	*	He was a kind mentor to humanity, not just Mr Matthews
t1_dt75o4f	0.659700	*	Personally I would rather that they be split into separate parties that then negotiate coalitions out in the open. Right now the Republican party consists of a coalition that is relatively opaque.
t1_dtk8ckb	0.000000	*	Or donate an arm and a leg.
t1_dsoav2w	-0.790600	*	Great coming from a group that gets mad at facts and yells racism at stating the facts. It's what assholes do I suppose. 
t1_dtgtqv9	0.504000	*	>Sorry I brushed up against your safe space?  What?
t1_dtqiac0	0.685800	*	That seems like a good point, but I don't actually know enough about British political history to be sure. It depends on the expectations of the poll, I guess.
t1_dsvxpgu	0.273200	*	VZ has been in difficulty for a long time.  If you have a computer fast enough to mine coin, you likely don't need to mine coin because you are well connected enough to be secure.
t1_dttbzxq	0.063900	*	No doubt about it: the US is huge. However, it advantageous to the powers that be that not many leave the the shores of America.  
t1_dtnfzgu	0.517800	*	A person sent crazy messages online to another person??!! Wow.  How relevant.    /s

t1_dtj852e	0.648600	*	Yeah but they have their male priviledge going for them, which is nice /s. It reminds me of [this.]( https://imgur.com/gallery/8ZhoV)

t1_dtj8g5g	-0.526700	*	It is not and should not be 24 countries' responsibility if two countries fail to protect their borders. That's ridiculous. 
t1_dskfoia	0.000000	*	But would he really be assassinated in Britain? America has guns. What are Brits going to do, lob sausage rolls at him?

t1_dsdrsjt	0.440400	*	What I'm saying is if people elect better people in local and state elections, after a few terms some of them will run for national seats. It starts at the bottom 
t1_dtq8dxe	-0.250000	*	Thank fuck. But still. Means Tory MPs will be given a 3 line whip on Brexit votes. 
t1_dt7pmz1	-0.709600	*	Justice also matters, for the millions and millions who've died. Letting them walk would never happen. There would be massively violent protests. 
t1_du7jawy	0.000000	*	He guides you
t1_dsk8oso	0.687200	*	Uhh except, as someone from the Midwest, this is entirely accurate, then yeah I think he probably says kinder things in private.
t1_dslx6nt	-0.692100	*	It's actually far more stupid because again there aren't 600 million Norwgians but I get your point but you didn't talk about controlling for population either so you ignored his core point.
t1_dtmoezt	0.612400	*	Google it.  Immune responses are fast and powerful.
t1_dskf7gf	-0.057200	*	nothing screams i dont understand statistics like this comment

t1_dshrc5j	-0.420100	*	That's a completely ridiculous reading of my post. Read it again. 
t1_dt313fy	-0.659900	*	Literally the first one in the video is before that. That's just his way of mocking people. He wasn't making fun of the reporter for being disabled. Don't turn it into something it's not.

t1_dt5tghk	-0.493900	*	The right will never cave on amnesty. We learned that lesson in the 80s  Humanitarian my ass. Childish liberal policies encouraged more illegals to come, and continue to do so

t1_dtixtvw	0.214400	*	Some people definitely could but there are many who just aren't able to live normal lives.

t1_dtq2nr9	-0.153100	*	It's not, unless you're Republican. To them, the USA is great no matter what shitty decisions people make.
t1_dssgwh8	0.765000	*	See my other reply. Everything is violent, and yes, I've read my Bible. super graphic stuff, but the underlying message is peace.
t1_dtqfzr0	-0.910000	*	Islamic extremists are rigntwing?  Youre delusional. Youre nuts.  Leftwing terrorism is the second most deadly form of terrorism in europe. Seperatism being first.

t1_dtkv95y	0.000000	*	I would say the clitoral hood would be more equivalent to the foreskin, since the head of the penis is equivalent to the clitoris.
t1_dtedszs	0.000000	*	What?
t1_dtn07f2	-0.273200	*	I mean doctors are trained in science and medicine. Nurses are closer to the average person not trained those fields, only because they didnt go through the rigorous fucking education we did.

t1_dte8fg7	-0.025800	*	Lol why? We will never give up Israel and there is nothing the world can do about it. Nuclear weapons have cemented our country as permanent on the map.
t1_dsnvrpg	0.000000	*	You pronounce @ as aut ?
t1_dsi6l2v	-0.504000	*	Let me rephrase. Nobody can criticise Russia *and* the US? You have to have some sort of moral high ground?
t1_dt6y74a	-0.273200	*	Not defending Russia at all, I think you misread my statement. I was saying the guy I replied to was replying to an 18 day old account.

t1_dtuc6bv	0.226300	*	I'd argue that that's a form of nihilism, or maybe a better word is resentment. People like that still don't feel like they have anything to live for except to make life worse for the innocent.

t1_dsq8szc	-0.340000	*	That's fair. I guess i just feel like the intent of the attacker is also a big component to it. It would be super interesting if a prosecutor tried to argue sexual assault or molestation in court.

t1_dt0b8ve	0.197000	*	Why do so many more people want to move to white countries than any other? I'd say a culture where women are seen as men's property is worse than one where they are free.

t1_dskolri	0.000000	*	How is that relevant to what I'm saying
t1_dsfhora	0.179300	*	I don't worry about what others eat. I'm just curious as to the philosophy behind the decision  Edit: What is hypocritical? I don't get what the last bit of your statement is saying.

t1_dsmxrox	0.000000	*	What if the polar bear is wearing a blue and black dress? 
t1_dt4hsy5	0.000000	*	Not always. For example, Frontiers publishing does not take impact into their review criteria, only if the science is sound.
t1_dsjmk1b	0.077200	*	I've found very few people who agree with my(and your) viewpoint on this.  Just leave people alone.

t1_dtdpvs8	0.680000	*	Start a pressure group. Lobby the Irish government. I'm sure people will sign up!  Id be happy boycotting both SA and Israel. Go for it Champ
t1_dtx35g7	0.361200	*	It's not even about allies. China doesn't sell at market rates since they heavily subsidise their solar industry. US tariffs should be applied only against heavy subsidisers like China IMO.

t1_dtogtih	0.421500	*	That is objectively true. 
t1_dtbvhcz	0.000000	*	That's a separate issue from the whole T_D taking up the entire front page with Russian vote bots thing. 
t1_dt6lvqx	-0.228000	*	True enough. I greatly dislike partisan politics. Tribalism, historically speaking, has never worked out well for the advancement of the civilizations embracing it.
t1_dst5cv7	0.669700	*	I used to live there mate. The Communist Party is run more like a mafia than a government.

t1_dt9n6l3	0.555600	*	What else could US have done though? SK is an ally and US gotta support an ally. SK didn't stop being an ally when that first president of SK decided to become a dictator.

t1_dswkr39	-0.651000	*	Conspiracy theories are just the CIA sowing confusion and distrust in the populace so they're easier to control.
t1_dshvejo	0.000000	*	Russia owns him. 
t1_dswpix8	0.153100	*	It's actually one of the things I envy of church groups. I wish there were large secular groups that would do this for non religious families. 
t1_dtvrn4c	-0.025800	*	If we had less people, it would be easier to manage. If you have kids, you are environmentally irresponsible until such a time as we can learn to manage resources.
t1_dszgw1s	0.836000	*	It's condescending for sure. But for something so simple, Google is literally easier than asking someone on Reddit...  Google even gives you a cool graph and links to as many sources as you'd like.

t1_dt9ch05	0.458800	*	If it claims Trump touched you in the early 90s, they honestly probably would. 
t1_dti66fv	0.226300	*	But did they legally define all of the words in the legal definition?
t1_dszgt0r	0.000000	*	And shootings in a developed nation, period. 
t1_dsgn4xy	-0.493900	*	Im mad at everyone for doing it. But he ran on swamp cleaning and its not getting done...the swamp just has rednecks swimming in it now.
t1_dtlxd1v	0.493900	*	Yeah I get that, which is part of why I don't intend on trying it ever.  Though I would chew on some coca leaves if given the chance probably. Stimulants in general seem overrated though.
t1_dtb7bnv	0.000000	*	Or PonziCoin
t1_dso3jmc	0.296000	*	Yeah, so what is your point ? His speech was an anti-war speech, that was all. If that's not criminalising speech I don't know what is... 
t1_dtokaof	0.000000	*	Maybe it has something to do with the industrial revolution taking place at the end of a miniature ice age. I just think we need to be careful about falling into the correlation/causation fallacy. 
t1_dtdmu2z	-0.612400	*	Ok, whatever you think of how Israel handles terrorism against them, it still doesn't change the fact that terrorism isn't the result of the occupation, but the other way around.
t1_dsdarnu	-0.177900	*	Weird how fragile bitcoin millionaires egos are. Wonder what they could possibly be overcompensating for...

t1_dswyo87	0.401900	*	This conversation makes me wish I could read Chickenhawk for the first time again.
t1_dtcli3p	-0.104500	*	Not really true. Cows fed too much corn can get overly acidic rumens and fuck up their digestion/health and make them prone to disease. 
t1_dsphgfi	0.726900	*	Interesting - it shows some wisdom to lock some of the money away.  Regardless 8K goes a long way backpacking through some countries. 
t1_dssux26	-0.296000	*	But for reals though, if palestinians were real men they wouldn't let tiny things such as foreign interference stop them from whatever their goals are.  Right?

t1_dt7qjba	-0.612400	*	Wouldn't be long may be an overstatement. East Germany was nowhere near as behind as NK is now and is still an economic burden to the rest of the state.

t1_dta5y51	-0.153100	*	What is better: A fine or a traditional British duel to the dead?
t1_dsjwgbq	0.458800	*	>  They wouldn't have chosen to run Hillary Clinton against Trump.  You actually think the American people chose these two candidates? That's cute.
t1_dsfd101	0.000000	*	Not really. In the Arab world, the derogatory term fagg*t is Looteh which comes from Loot (Lot in Arabic).
t1_dsoti4z	-0.582300	*	Your question perplexes me. May I ask why you're not a Trump supporter? What is it about Trump's platform/ideology that you disagree with?
t1_dsl16a7	-0.787600	*	Even Trump ain't that bad yet, one wrong turn and all of a sudden you're reading comments mourning the death of Hitler and the Third Reich. YT comments are the #1 way to lose all faith in humanity.

t1_dsm22s1	-0.493900	*	Not every president.  Some presidents continuously cancel trips to London and avoid visiting their closest neighbours, even after invitations.
t1_dspmk8e	-0.401900	*	Not that I *like* to watch, I was merely *expecting* to watch, possibly knowing it might disturb me. Hence the slight disapointment, it was anti-climatic.
t1_dswgncc	0.735100	*	I work in assurance.  But more to the point, no you really don't have any justification to hold a strong opinion on this subject which you clearly don't have an education in.

t1_dt97gya	-0.402300	*	the record holder for dog vocabulary is a Border Collie with over 1000.  Let that sink in Trump's vocabulary is not impressive for a dog
t1_dsdzeie	-0.237400	*	Holy fucking shit this sounds like conspiratorial crazy talk but it kind of blew my mind. I always wondered why no one of importance ever got fudged with out there considering. ...every thing
t1_dt9s9dh	0.340000	*	Ahh, so you're regularly marathon driving between Vienna and Moscow with only a single piss break.  That's awesome while being highly typical of 99% of drivers.
t1_dsz0aiw	0.401900	*	yes
t1_dsjbo98	0.557400	*	If you are referring to the influx of people who are coming in to Europe seeking a better life but have not pre-declared their status.   Then economic migrant. Would serve you well.

t1_dtst52t	0.000000	*	Saudi Arabia only mandates the scarf for muslims. Even still, that hardly constitutesmost.  Cultural expectations of some rural tribes aren't law.

t1_dtjbwck	-0.476700	*	So things that are wrong shouldn't be stood against because it doesn't effect a person directly.  
t1_dtcimbk	0.190100	*	Thank you.   This is what I wanted to say but you got the words right
t1_dtaojtp	0.726900	*	Rich people would never instruct their political employees to enact rules like that.
t1_dtx08ym	-0.865800	*	Its merely a jest, I dont think people should take anti Semitic frat boys seriously... I worry more for the Jews in the Middle East getting killed than the ones in Europe...

t1_dtfafsa	-0.625900	*	We don't. We trade value for value. The green paper is just a convenient way to convey value. You trade your labour for a car (more than likely) 
t1_dtvuhqu	0.250000	*	Copyright laws are *much* worse in the US because of how our legal system works. It's much easier for large companies to engage in spurious lawsuits over here. 
t1_dtve3ds	0.556300	*	The tabletop is incredibly fun, I don't know what you're talking about.
t1_dsmpfwg	0.296000	*	You mean they take a credit from the customer that they should pay for.
t1_dtkg7r3	-0.700300	*	I think some lumps can be diagnosed by touch.  Testicular cancer for example I believe is a hard rock-like lump while the softer lumps are not cancerous.  I am not a doctor.
t1_dtdghlq	-0.542300	*	I know. Communism is when it is simultaniously a stateless, classless society and also when the goveenment does stuff and kills people and when everyone is equal.
t1_dsu9zhe	-0.458800	*	Arresting people for attacking soldiers is allowed everywhere. Its specifically in the Fourth Geneva Convention.  
t1_dtqdmjk	0.458800	*	Eh. There is a reason it ended up on TIL. It was already widely known by most people that take an interest in those things.

t1_dsh052v	-0.909200	*	What is the first thing that you think of when Israel comes up?  Dont get me wrong but even if we pretend that there is no racism going on, how would you summarize Israels stand on immigration?

t1_dsvztfd	-0.598300	*	Obviously it's because of that nasty brigade of professional, paid propagandists from T_D headquartered in Russia!  #/s
t1_dtqhjml	-0.963700	*	True, but I look at the fast and the furious scandal. We can't justify taking the guns away if this incompetent government is sending them out to criminals.

t1_dtmpjui	0.457400	*	I mean during founding. For instance, US was founded on blood. I think you could be right about Switzerland though. Interesting topic though!

t1_dtcxk3g	0.656200	*	His comparison isn't right so I corrected it.  I didn't argue the other points because I agree with them but I suppose giving corrections is now considered deflection.

t1_dt4nnqs	-0.102700	*	That's the thing -- he's not at the table. There's an empty seat where US governance used to sit but the negotiations continue never-the-less. 
t1_dsffbvb	0.690800	*	Ah, I never knew that. Sounds like only those associated with the trademark should care, though, and the trademark is probably indefensible at this point, anyway.

t1_dt6vxx6	-0.571900	*	Nah. Ill stick around.   And no, the charter never mentions financial compensation. Like I said, the remedy was allowing that piece of shit back in the country. 
t1_dth9y5p	-0.557400	*	Dude you can't even stay on topic or read the replies to your comments properly, or even stay up to date on what was voted against.  Get your shit together.

t1_dt3t575	-0.202300	*	If you admit that you are wrong while pointing out someone else similar action, then yes.  If you use someone else actions to justify yours, then no.
t1_dsy5hfz	0.226300	*	Okay so if you wandered over the border into Canada tomorrow, do they have a right to kick you out? Because that's all that Israel is doing, only with 40,000 people.

t1_dtjqswj	-0.328700	*	Sure, but his point was that India and the US were both part of the British Empire at the same time. Which is not true. India was controlled by Britons, not the Crown.

t1_dskz0cs	0.881700	*	So your solution is to gut it further? You can ask those questions and think about it all you want but you won't be stripping away my right to free speech, thanks anyway though.
t1_dt6mvog	0.571900	*	This term 4th term is not so much an election of Merkel as an opportunity for her to choose and cultivate a successor, a mini-Merkel if you will.

t1_dtdgzu8	-0.873800	*	You mean the empire that was mostly gone before most of us were born? Do you wanna take a moment to speak about slavery and racism if you want to go down that route?
t1_dt57z3g	-0.432500	*	Youd still need many people to miss that fact that pt A never got the med. not saying its impossible, just unlikely at least at the institutions I work at, which are nothing special.  
t1_dta1fnz	0.000000	*	Not according to german law.  I did not make the rules. I just apply them.
t1_dsxrbaj	-0.831600	*	Your comment about the hospital has no relation to this topic. There's no need for personal insults just because you disagree with what I say. 
t1_dsvapyj	0.668200	*	Since you seem to be [illiterate](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26905895), yes, it's very much like that.
t1_dslnosh	0.000000	*	I dont even know where to start. . . I think il let someone else explain it to you. Or you can go on believing as you will.
t1_dt4nwxh	0.102700	*	What do you think people have been doing?   In Ontario we do a weed march every year, smoking in public, and that's just one demonstration.

t1_dsrayq9	-0.128000	*	But surely any jump in crime (even if its not comparable) which happens due to cuts made by the government is a fair discussion point right?
t1_dtlerhs	-0.492600	*	By that logic, there could also be even *less* attacks perpetrated by Muslims, since, you know, eye witness testimonies are unreliable, right? Maybe all these people *THOUGHT* they were Muslim!
t1_dsgepk0	0.000000	*	How he does anything is a yuge mystery to me. 
t1_dsgedhu	-0.680800	*	By that logic you should lock them inside the house, cuz they can get raped by anyone at anytime.
t1_dtfmznr	0.125300	*	Serious question.  Write it off if you like, but it's that sort of behavior that got Trump elected.  Your opinion doesn't matter is not the message to convey.

t1_dtjmes0	-0.738500	*	In general, women aren't the problem. It's almost always men involved in terrorism, war, and oppression--keeping the women sweet and shy is a big part of that.

t1_dsp1m54	0.380200	*	That's the one!  (I think; I don't actually know.  I just know that one of the airplanes that carried them was called Voodoo, which is just a cool name for a nuclear armed fighter.)
t1_dt8u4ug	0.000000	*	The only way you can throw away your vote is by not casting it. 
t1_dsezt3j	-0.307100	*	Glitter is not the reason you are able to support a global economy based heavily on the shipping of goods from one place to another, I'm sorry but you will just have to take the loss.

t1_dte85tb	0.075400	*	They use a lot of coal. That's a cute way of calling the air pea soup. China is a frickin joke. It's a massive polluter. Shoot the majority of pollution in *California* is from China.

t1_dtml9g1	-0.757900	*	At the very least you can check Russia replacing us as top dog off that list. Those stupid fuckers spent all their cash holding together the USSR and they've been bruised ever since. 
t1_dta61ol	0.000000	*	The Saud kingdom has always been a construct of foreign power.  By that metric, he would be unchallengeable.

t1_dsuzdbf	0.361200	*	I agree its a factual statement as I've been there. Whether or not its a tactful way of expressing such is irrelevant to the fact itself.
t1_dtcijpz	-0.361200	*	Well.  Guess you're stuck then and there its no way out since there is no chance to change your situation.  I wish you a quick death.   Edit:  Accept death and you will free yourself

t1_dtk9fdv	0.361200	*	The Cold War never ended. The idea that we won was a marketing coup by rightwing politicians. They enabled a total shift in the Democratic Party being based center to center right.

t1_dsl7530	0.557400	*	Sounds like an entitled taker to me.
t1_dtc0zw4	-0.386200	*	No, not at all. The people of Afghanistan are far more desensitized. I assure you if they even get news about a US school shooting they wouldnt give two squatting shits.

t1_dtkb4md	-0.610500	*	But if there is intense pain and tearing during an erection? That is not an ain't broke scenario.

t1_dtwqe5l	0.631800	*	This is one of the most logical posts I've read so far. I'm really surprised the value of human life vs other animals is scoffed at by such a large number of people. 
t1_dsgne3b	0.585300	*	You are getting a bit carried away and ridiculous. It's not hard to rationalize if you are carrying something worth 200K that you are ultimately responsible for it's safety.     
t1_dska9zj	0.250000	*	Too bad he said that less than 20 years ago.   Edit: I'm pretty sure /u/Avenflar knew this and wasnt trying to defend Trump, everybody. Either way, we dont all need to downvote him or her. 
t1_dsmu37m	-0.273200	*	I'm going to dive into them tonight after I'm about a dozen beers and half a bottle of bourbon deep. It will be extreme no matter what place on the spectrum of emotions my reaction falls on.
t1_dtlsdwz	-0.571900	*	This new experimental form of head protection that's in the works is reason enough to stop worrying about the gun that's currently aimed at your head.  You sure about that? 
t1_dsg7u6g	0.190100	*	Its kind of boggling if you actually try to imagine seeing the world from their perspective. Like, I've come to terms with them existing but I still don't get them.

t1_dt74uf4	0.924600	*	Maybe you should dig up a finance text book and learn how companies decide what projects to pursue... this is honestly true. In fact it's not just honestly true. It's eminently true.
t1_dtx6k9k	-0.250000	*	That's a state thing. In Arizona you basically need a Driver's license or all the documents you would bring to get a Driver's license, including proof of citizenship because we're extra paranoid.

t1_dtf6w55	-0.115400	*	There is also a US military base in Cuba but if they were marching around Havana in unmarked uniforms while monitoring a referendum on whether Cuba should join the US that would be ridiculous.

t1_dsf3at0	0.624000	*	2% I imagine would be well within standard deviation and wouldn't prove anything.   So yes, 'above average'. But how does 2% variance show discriminatory practices? 
t1_dsmo918	0.273200	*	Well the brexit vote was a vast majority so why can't this be one?

t1_dt1k66h	-0.204700	*	My point is that there really wasn't that much of a defined agenda or demand for the protest beyond we don't like Trump, and I feel that they could've used the opportunity to codify that agenda.
t1_dsm05nz	-0.488900	*	First one, too! I've seen several people claiming it's anonymous reports or fake news, and most just ignored proof that it's all true.

t1_dsjv79z	0.309400	*	That's not the correct analogy... Are you being deliberately obtuse? Has the governor of California called Alabama a shithole and asked why they allow Alabamans to move to California?
t1_dskhzg7	-0.618700	*	Fuck you man I may be deplorable but I'm no Nazi
t1_dtwzvhb	-0.031400	*	It's kinda actually sad that redditors are more likely to believe we're all literal Russian agents than think some people could support Trump.   Man I just wanna see the illegals gone. 
t1_dshownw	-0.526700	*	It means I'm going to view your argument differently though. And if the question is ideological/moral/about right or wrong, then yeah, I can dismiss your points because you're logically inconsistent.

t1_dslvnri	0.391900	*	I was kind of expecting a picture of William Wallace, but this works as well
t1_dt6sgoa	0.000000	*	Probably they are using proxies/vpn-services. So they don't connect directly from there.

t1_dtfhs2p	0.000000	*	Asking the right questions here. Do they have new tactical golf carts for just this purpose? Is that the real reason behind the cost?
t1_dtu9z3q	0.000000	*	Did you even read that article? It literally states it's skewed and not using the median.

t1_dtw6a7i	-0.771000	*	Your right. That's filthy.  Rape does not need to be involved but we should totally threaten to skin his family and wear them. That is more equivalent.

t1_dt83b3k	-0.477900	*	We're talking about threats to international order, most of those are only issues with Americans aside from the wmd lies. So, yeah, still deflecting
t1_dsq8yzb	0.000000	*	Duuude, exactly the same thoughts, I even posted something similar to this several times. People lost their ability to reason without source

t1_dtsql6s	-0.750600	*	Or maybe HKers should reflect on why mainlanders hate them so much.   The vast majority of mainlanders have never visited HK yet are still treated as inferior by HKers. 
t1_dtm026i	-0.391900	*	Correct me if I'm wrong, but you're from Cambodia, right?  Kampuchea was supported by the US and despised by essentially everyone who was sane.

t1_dtl78xv	0.332100	*	It's more principle than well thought out policy.
t1_dttavt1	-0.502300	*	Same here. It was one of the things we heard about as kids and found it absurd, even as children. It might be only half true but we knew it sounded wrong.

t1_dtn24xn	-0.273200	*	The memo asserts that the Steele Dossier was biased opposition research that most likely wouldn't be considered reliable to a court. I'm asking why that part is considered inaccurate.

t1_dt1d3nt	0.592100	*	Pretty sad to think that the government of the richest country in the world can't be trusted to fulfill a contract properly though.
t1_dszwxiq	-0.025800	*	No. But it's still an unlocked door with consoles, flat screen tvs, a good gaming computer and some paintings. Everything can be easily sold if you wanna steal it.

t1_dsw0ifl	0.585900	*	Agreed, but the were legendary and that must give some creedence to how exceptional they were; though I suppose that could be due to a later romanticization.
t1_dswpzw8	0.273200	*	No, I think the baby should get vacuumed and parents should get fixed. Both should be free and compulsory.

t1_dtvigc0	-0.759000	*	> It's because they're uneducated on the subject.  I feel like not being educated on trophy hunting is a really poor excuse for threating to rape someone's wife and hunt them like an animal.
t1_dt9xvf4	-0.802000	*	Leaving women like Emma Stone heartbroken is a criminal offense in my book
t1_dtt5zkk	0.446900	*	Except that other people can tell when you're wearing a scarf, but not when you're praying. If you want an analogy, then mandatory headscarves are like mandatory nipple covering.
t1_dsvunfc	0.318200	*	I'm sure Russia is gonna get to the bottom of this.
t1_dt73tny	-0.724800	*	Because it's not backed by a single study or any existing numbers. Show me a credible source that predicts what he said.   And no, it's not plausible. So I'll stick with it's bullshit
t1_dsr9p50	-0.308900	*	A comment  > I do wonder why Bill is spending money abroad, rather than the *USA*.  Your reply  > We have the means to fix things *here*, we just choose not to.  Yes, we think you live in America.

t1_dsf2z0r	0.000000	*	France looks after people with French nationality, irrespective of their ethnicity.  Israel looks after people with Israeli nationality AND Jewish ethnicity.  Does that make sense?

t1_dthgo2b	0.557400	*	I didn't say it was motivated by political party. You injected that right there in the end of your comment. I said biased against Trump. The same way McCain, Graham, and every Democrat is.

t1_dto790i	-0.155600	*	I get the feeling I'm the one old enough to be your Dad. What is it about the mounting evidence the GOP has been compromised by Russia do you not agree with?
t1_dsgx2xf	-0.571900	*	What do you actually know about how Russian spies work? This is about how pathetic it gets when it comes to self-appointed experts on reddit

t1_dsugotp	0.271600	*	Says the guy/gal that thinks anecdotes are more significant than legit stats.
t1_dt0mcyi	0.177900	*	Maybe actually calling them out for giving false information instead of just insulting them like a child is a logical response
t1_dtgh5ua	0.000000	*	That's what she said.
t1_dtvxzu5	-0.296000	*	What, the facetious questions? No
t1_dstmke3	0.884700	*	True, but solving them is also unlikely to bring lasting happiness. Humans want more than survival

t1_dt3c9wk	0.571900	*	This is a great summary.  Thank you for your time.  I came to post something weaker.
t1_dt5atmq	0.177900	*	No, the original poster was correct.  The subject of the sentence is number, which the verb is/are acts on. Because it is being used as a singular collective noun, you need to use is here.
t1_dtiw31n	0.700300	*	Arafat's family isn't, and they are living pretty off Palestinian blood. And Abbas is alive doing the same thing.

t1_dtnkdzk	0.077200	*	Yeah people forget that he needs to pad his stats as an independent by voting no on bipartisan bills.  It's the same reason he voted against amber alert.

t1_dt9xs9c	0.713400	*	:P Trust me, I don't think ignorance is restricted to being American. I just feel that, despite widespread cultural naivety, most countries still manage not to end up in headlines for it.

t1_dsogrst	-0.025800	*	They are probably the kind of filters I'm talking about then. It is all about preventing radioactive dust from entering your lungs. 
t1_dt9sbkb	0.458800	*	Free market? Tell me again who just imposed tariffs
t1_dtptqr0	0.000000	*	I worked for a major ISP/cable provider a few years ago and 100% had access to this information. Because if someone called wanting a refund we had to know what to refund obviously.

t1_dttwlpj	-0.286900	*	I list many sources and you list one. And you accuse me of being narrow with my sources? You must be a troll?

t1_dt8vg28	0.765000	*	Thats not really influence of any kind, even. Its *their* events that theyre excluding the agreement breakers from. Literally any organization can do that. 
t1_dsjsniw	0.181800	*	I can agree with stealing their data, nothing to be gained by discarding good data for morals after the fact.   However, they really shouldn't have given refuge and even fame to those people.
t1_dsnpv66	-0.714900	*	Are you Naziphobic?  Or is it less about fear and more about disagreeing with ideology?
t1_dt5o63u	-0.025800	*	No it doesn't. It's a general term, much like Anonymous and the way they were an umbrella label for many different groups taking uncoordinated actions with a vague set of goals in mind.
t1_dsz7pgm	-0.896800	*	Reddit doesnt hate them because theyre women, they hate them because theyre vile people.   The comments usually have nothing to do with their sex, but how theyre disgusting people.

t1_dsx2a08	0.000000	*	That topic has an answer in Canadian law, and that answer is that it is not a human. Until the law changes, I would expect the government to act accordingly.
t1_dsnw8gs	-0.361200	*	Adverse possession has been law longer than America has been a country, fam. 
t1_dsv5c1l	0.571900	*	you mean like a lobotomy?... yeah. same page.
t1_dtiuets	-0.476700	*	It is fake news. There were 9 people in the meeting. Only one said he said it. 8 said he didnt and one even said he didnt under oath.  It didn't happen. 
t1_dtunx4e	-0.275500	*	Yup, those launch and land pads are incredibly expensive / time consuming to build, so it makes sense if you know it's not perfect to avoid it.
t1_dt6h5lw	0.507000	*	Because he is talking like a moral authority when he is just as hipocrate as all other popes. He could do so much more to improve the world yet he chooses not to, all in the name of greed. 
t1_dt59qe5	-0.690800	*	The majority of reddit is a sucker for anti trade populism.  And you're almost right, 16 cases have ever been brought against the US under ISDS according to Investment Policy Hub.

t1_dso740u	-0.694500	*	What am I saying that's not true? Provide a good conversation or fuck off.   Edit: like out of all I posted and you just say that. Your practically proving my point

t1_dtwkpcc	0.583100	*	The Habsburgs. Which, of course, were an Austrian dynasty, I'm not arguing that at all. But it's not as simple as HRE = Austria. The prince-electors and the Reichsunmittelbarkeit made sure of that.

t1_dtl3fep	0.690800	*	What do you mean? They were not a part of the Mclearen report. Their tests where not tampered with, nor do they have any positive tests brushed under the carpet (unlike a certain Norwegian skier).

t1_dsjhbv9	-0.248400	*	200 explosives small enough to fit on a $300 drone will not take out a whole town or village. You could do a lot more damage with the >$100k this operation would cost.

t1_dsrtbnk	0.735100	*	Of course it does, I never meant that alt coins would follow every single dip, just that if Bitcoin truly crashes, confidence in crypto will fall enough to bring the whole market down.

t1_dtif66e	-0.226300	*	You're completely misrepresenting what he said. He said Reddit in general. He said outright without qualification that leftists go apeshit.
t1_dtbczl4	0.720800	*	Tbh this looks intense and pretty hard to execute cleanly like they do. I don't find it beautiful, but it's still a feat of strength.

t1_dt9km26	-0.476700	*	Sad thing is, if you can get someone else to also print it, say a blog post or two, it has a very high likelihood of being printed.

t1_dtu7pzj	0.704200	*	Oh, philosophers from the 1800s can't be relevant? Oh well, guess I'll toss out Socrates and Aristotle too. Also liberalism is based on John Locke, so better back out of that.
t1_dtigq4q	-0.680800	*	>they are Americans just like your redneck ass.    Exactly. And illegal immigrants are not Americans. So, your point is irrelevant. One group belongs here and the other does not.

t1_dt2kzsx	0.361200	*	Can confirm, college roommate who went on to be priest didn't believe it either. It was all about the underlying message, like anything else in the Bible.

t1_dtt9b1s	0.458800	*	It's always interesting to see when folks start hiding their scores in conversations like this.   You're being downvoted because you're obtuse, not because the reddit hive mind is out to get you. 
t1_dsjcijz	0.000000	*	So you've been to the middle East and India? Because I've been to both, extensively. What's the basis for your opinion...the movies? Wikipedia?
t1_dskyduq	0.458800	*	That actually took me a second :)
t1_dshfmes	0.273200	*	I never buy bags and just go through the self checkout line and take them.   Personally I re-use every bag as a trash bag for my bins as well rather than simply throw them out.

t1_dsv0286	-0.421500	*	Christians think Words are spells and have meaning. Say the lords name in vain or prayer. That is false.

t1_dsmyq8a	0.345100	*	And what about this situation would be grounds for disobedience, and not just insubordination? Its not illegal for a president to issue a nuclear strike.

t1_dsp1qln	0.758400	*	That's so dumb. You need to learn about the time value of money. Essentially you are giving the US government a 2k (now its 4000 with the new tax reform) interest free loan.

t1_dsjgic8	0.177900	*	The problem is the assumption that the press are honest. Once you have a large enough quantity of biased news sources there'll always be people willing to break ranks and tout the party line.

t1_dtp8iig	0.877900	*	Yep. Endless US and o/s based groups and individuals make sure of it, not to mention wikipedia.  Russia on the other hand can't critique of any kind. Such thin-skinned babies.

t1_dtlam9q	0.226300	*	We should have looked the other way and allowed a genocide to continue because you think that might have appeased Russia? See, this is why it's impossible to have debates about politics anymore.
t1_dshovia	0.000000	*	Classic. 
t1_dtom6as	-0.475300	*	Hahahaha what! That is hysterical. Farm families are pillaged constantly and the government willingly turns a blind eye.

t1_dsr4os7	0.226300	*	That's true, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's right. It'll come down to how it's interpreted by lawyers and ultimately a judge.

t1_dtmkx9p	-0.080300	*	No trade deal doesn't mean no trade. If you don't know that I'm not going to explain the more complex points, do some research on how trade deals work.
t1_dsxkejf	0.202300	*	To offer a different opinion, I'd heard and read a lot about it, read it, and didn't think much of it. Gave it away and have no interest in reading the rest in the series.

t1_dtqj707	-0.726900	*	? Like what, Trump wants to nuke it and poison half the frickin world with nuclear fallout, that is not an option. His policy is the worst we have ever seen.

t1_dt10sot	0.102700	*	I'm an American and I'm just saying your country's laws are crazy to me. In the United States we have a major debate on what is a human being. It's less 1-sided here.

t1_dsz6uty	0.721500	*	Those claims are not in geopolitically sensitive areas and aren't denying nations access to natural resources like oil or food. Use your brain.

t1_dtuay9b	0.361200	*	I agree, when the wealth 90% of wealth is held by the 1%.  what does boycotting the remaining 10% they don't own do?  Nothing, is the harsh truth.  Unpleasant change is often done by force.
t1_dsz1vl4	0.440400	*	I bet the press haven't asked to speak to you though. Hope you are recovering buddy.

t1_dsu6gd1	-0.093600	*	>Duestch bank going to for money laundering  Nope they won't. They will fire some guy in the middle and put the blame on him/her. If anything they have a lot of scrutiny to face in Germany.

t1_dsx140b	0.401900	*	If there was enough public will you could change that. You can't just appeal to the law as the reason for something. The law only has power insofar as people support and enforce it.
t1_dtgtzu3	-0.685800	*	They're a little busy with Jews and steel beams to pay attention to this shit.

t1_dt1jk0t	-0.557400	*	Vox is absolute shit.
t1_dsmco41	-0.877900	*	Youre probably right.  Being subjected to prosecution by an oppressive communist regime because he dared to criticize their leader probably makes you jaded.

t1_dtprwv2	0.179300	*	I was not the one who made that claim and it seems strange to be defensive. It is on both of you to cite what you're saying - you can't criticise someone for not doing so whilst also not doing so.

t1_dtmu890	0.153100	*	Indeed, if the Republicans actually wanted to address these alleged corruptions in the FBI, they wouldn't be doing it in such a theatrical manner by publicly releasing some clearly biased memo.

t1_dto68uf	0.000000	*	Considering a majority of politicians are boners anyway,  >*xe9rection fxe9dxe9rale*.   Isn't actually that far off 
t1_dt695ey	0.709600	*	I don't know if you intended it or not but what you said up above was basically: Berating religious people is a positive thing. I was pointing out that line of thinking.
t1_dsmnuwn	0.361200	*	I 100% agree with you
t1_dsedamt	0.735100	*	When you think you're morally and ethically better, you think others will overlook actual ethical transgressions.
t1_dt5iyma	0.623900	*	Okay. Your random naysayer holds more weight than two random supporters. Got it!

t1_dt6g7rw	0.000000	*	Did I say in the same way?  I think not.
t1_dt7017m	0.570700	*	Yeah I could see that being frustrating over time. I'm sure someone's corrected me on it before, here's to hoping it sticks this time! 
t1_dsjzmss	-0.659700	*	To be *truly* fair, NBC is broadcast news and the FCC punishes those who say shit.
t1_dshspk5	0.151600	*	Trump's approval rating literally makes Dems look even worse. They couldn't beat the worst President in our era. It was an open net shot and they went with the margin of error.

t1_dstr68w	0.226300	*	Idk actually, that CNN article makes it seem like Moon really meant it. Granted, Moon isn't totally in favor of Trump's approach. He says it could bring about unintentional clashes.

t1_dtvjx99	0.128000	*	Access is not really the issue. I dont have quality of care complaints. Its just hyper expensive and predatory.

t1_dsuoggz	-0.487100	*	300 hundred nukes? What would be the environmental impact?   Most nukes we set off over sterile waste lands. Left little fallout becuse not much could be vaporized into dust.

t1_dtrp4db	0.128000	*	You took my joke way too seriously. 
t1_dt2rnuo	0.696800	*	Yep, the point is that a belief in God and the Big Bang theory arent mutually exclusive though so someone can believe both without contradicting themselves. 
t1_dtaqbhr	0.051600	*	IIRC, that original contract was only biased against Boeing because they'd recently been caught bribing their pet politicians even more flagrantly than usual & gotten fined for it.

t1_dsismyy	0.000000	*	Bobby Sands is Bobby Sands, they're two separate words and the alphabet is the same.  
t1_dtaalyi	0.000000	*	Yea, words have meaning, and neo literally just means new.  So neo-nazis are just new nazis.  New doesn't indicate a change in ideology.  It only indicates a change in time.
t1_dt5x2f0	0.000000	*	Not even what I am dreaming.
t1_dssf9o3	-0.724800	*	Yet you have no problem spouting bullshit as if it's fact without backing any of it up with any sources.   Look at my other comments and how to do it properly if you need any help.
t1_dsppg0r	-0.238000	*	Dont tell me you dont understand how this was meant. Your taxes in the US. Pretty clear we were talking hypothetically here, so fuck right off, not interested in trolls.

t1_dtg632j	0.659700	*	I'm sure calling them stupid will definitely win them over to your way of thinking rather than educating them.
t1_dstkizr	0.458800	*	I believe I mixed up Mecca and Medina. :)
t1_dtrix3w	-0.555900	*	I don't support either side, I was just making a point that picking an arbitrary point in history isn't helpful.
t1_dtoo5qo	0.446600	*	Oh OK. Of course a parachuting PILOT is a different beast entirely. The term kind of threw me off. I would have rather used: SHOOTING BAILING CREW .
t1_dsenzhw	0.152600	*	Unfortunately, despite being grim and dark, martyrdom, in many cases, has proven to be practically legendary through the course of history. 
t1_dtd97kv	0.318200	*	Fair enough. By the way, I'm noticing a trend of scores being hidden on Reddit. How and why did you do it to your comments?
t1_dtty42y	0.000000	*	Not quite. Even inequality adjusted HDI, which accounts for inequality, still lists the US quite high (above Spain, Italy etc). 
t1_dseqcim	0.361200	*	I wouldn't exactly call Vietnam a bastion of freedom either. A guy from the Mekong delta was summoned by police for mocking street decorations, comparing them to a woman's knickers.
t1_dthyp4q	0.510600	*	A trump supporter fact checking statements? Now thats the real joke here. You idiots dont deal in reality and facts in the first place. 
t1_dtgzkc6	0.077200	*	Thats not stretching, thats basic psych and mental health knowledge.  And if you want proof: not one country with proper work life balance has the obesity rate the US does.
t1_dtsiwy7	0.250000	*	Sure. Regulations that discourage monopolies or other anti-competetive behavior like price fixing or collusion. The Sherman Act for example.

t1_dsk0tap	-0.509300	*	Whoa dude. Gay also means happy, too bad we can't use that word to mean that anymore! You sound hateful, you should try to be gay
t1_dt1s18v	-0.571900	*	lmao. do you want to work 14 hours a day for starvation wages with no breaks doing the same repetitive task literally 10,000 times a day?  if no, sweatshops are bad.

t1_dt903o3	0.670500	*	Welllllllllllll, Bush won the popular vote in 2004. But that was mostly because of a depressingly successful false smear campaign against Kerry.

t1_dsr9mgs	0.128000	*	The men choose to do this themselves, and it is a medical castration, nothing gets snipped. It is  pretty much the same as medicating any other mental illness. 
t1_dsosmfi	0.778300	*	Oh wow clever. Howd you come up with that one?
t1_dtprhji	0.510600	*	Are we sure that distributing includes seeding, rather than just the person who created and uploaded the file to pirate bay or wherever?

t1_dtbne61	0.153100	*	You know, we joke, but that's something he could have said, and it is something which Stalin probably did say.

t1_dt9z3fe	-0.143100	*	So what do you want to do? Restrict the ability of people to set up scholarship? The solution is for more people to set up scholarships for poorer men, not tear down ones that already exist for women.

t1_dsh7dpp	0.401900	*	I swear their black coffee was good in the 90s.  My morning visit to Timmy's was: one Toronto Star, a black coffee, 1 maple timbits, and half a packet of du Maurier lights.  Legend-ary.

t1_dtc07md	-0.905200	*	Because a lot of people cant do anything. There are billions of humans on this planet, its too many people for us to do much but feel sad about a tragedy that we cant affect thousands of miles away. 
t1_dt1sl0t	-0.612400	*	It's currently working for Hungary and Israel. It's a hell of a lot easier to catch someone climbing over a wall verses hiding among the plants and rocks.

t1_dso5bly	0.636900	*	Surplus does not mean 40 years old gas mask, you can buy perfectly functioning <10 years old gas masks with 40mm threaded filters, you just have to buy new un-expired filters. 
t1_dsmjkva	-0.250000	*	Ours just got done fighting redcaps and we're about to kick the shit out of some trolls.  Fuck, I think my D&D game actually is real life.

t1_dspqx5v	-0.771700	*	Being serial killer is not ideology though. If you use analogies, use relevant ones.  And the article title includes 'Islamic' because these people are using Islam as a base of denying vaccination.

t1_dsjnwrk	-0.612400	*	They could do that... or the could buy a shitty old truck for a few hundred bucks and load it with explosives. The explosives are of course the hard part to get, not the delivery mechanism.

t1_dsrn3kk	-0.357000	*	Oh I see what you mean now. Either way I think the main point is don't applaud the guy.
t1_dt0pzxt	0.476700	*	The US as a country didn't. The claim is that the people in charge of making the decisions and their friends did.

t1_dt8zmfw	-0.585900	*	Unprecedented?  This stuff on trump is mild compared to the bullshit that happened when Obama was in line to take office.  And much of Trumps is self inflicted.
t1_dskuhis	0.273200	*	Well, that and the US doesnt have a warrant for Assanges attest, nor have they had one.....

t1_dsqx7rd	-0.607700	*	That's why I'm doubting this weapon has been deployed at all. The Russians aren't crazy nihilsitic enough to risk so much. Same for the U.S.    
t1_dtr2zdp	0.214400	*	Yes, of course I'm aware of that. It's a relatively small minority now due to the genocide, but that doesn't detract from my point.

t1_dskjulh	-0.636900	*	Maybe because American soldiers did their fair share of brutal shit in Japan themselves. Using Japanese soldier's heads as hood ornaments comes to mind.
t1_dslma6p	0.765000	*	That's nice and noble. You can keep it. We believe in individualism and hard work. Our cultures are fundamentally different and that's ok.

t1_dsori8l	0.718400	*	To be fair I didn't move there. I went to SXSW to see gear and Andrew W.K. I was stationed in Louisiana at the time. Worth the 6 hour drive lol 
t1_dsn1kvx	0.571900	*	Not at all it is all to do with how fast you can cool it down fish can be dead for 5 days in good ice and as long as it went straight in to the ice when caught it is just as good as day one.
t1_dtektwz	0.401900	*	Also interested in hearing your thoughts 
t1_dt6ajkh	0.350600	*	I think that needs a /s.  There's a good chance that u/fbiagent_bertmacklin isn't a small business owner but has latched onto that narrative.

t1_dtbwdaq	0.273200	*	In their eyes God is on their side so everything is justifiable. 
t1_dtfze1w	0.599400	*	Good point. All the tribes had a lot of similarities in their culture, maybe not as different as in Britain after the Norman invasion because it created a big change in culture within England.
t1_dthrrvg	0.361200	*	Kind of like unicorns... have not seen one of those in a while.
t1_dsnt6r9	-0.848100	*	Right because chicks get so turned on by racism.  You know when youre losing an argument when you change the subject by calling someone a virgin or lib.

t1_dslxn98	0.153100	*	Solid analogy.
t1_dt4q9ut	-0.318200	*	You should read up on Chinese history before calling other people colonizers. China is actively colonizing neighbouring countries right now. Sweden quit that shit centuries ago.

t1_dt7dwn8	-0.361200	*	Can they get Spam in NK?

t1_dt35ani	0.000000	*	Tibet was de facto independent from 1912 to 1950. The republic of China didn't recognize their proclamation of independence, but it did nothing about it either.
t1_dtcek4n	0.000000	*	Im not talking about court though. I mean Trump could be hauled away in a striped suit and theyd still find a way to claim hes been framed by the deep state.
t1_dtqf1gz	0.636900	*	No that was to get Japan to accept *unconditional* surrender. Without crippling firebombings Japan still had the ability to negotiate advantageous surrender.

t1_dth2sfy	0.649400	*	Yeah it seems something the conservatives would care about, not the progressives. Though it could of course be a strategy to *make* the conservatives care, which still makes it highly hypocritical.

t1_dstz2q9	-0.636900	*	It's decorum. You concede to show grace in defeat. For some reason, lately the GOP has decided that decorum has no place in the government. It's rather disheartening. 
t1_dtogrwr	0.000000	*	Was WW2 not enough??
t1_dsgq421	0.848100	*	So this is one thing that Obama initiated that he'll take credit for.  It's bigly for the economy. It's, you know, super smart.

t1_dtrei47	0.526700	*	Honestly, it seems like they over invested in warehousing and store fronts and underestimated trucking regulations. Thats why cheaper product ends up in stores.

t1_dsw0ou6	-0.458800	*	No, I know the type. Just found it strange you would be referring a a completely different group of holocaust comparers in a thread about Rabbis making a holocaust comparison.
t1_dsvcl6t	0.598300	*	Yep, exactly. Fibrillation is irregular heartbeats, so defibrillation is making it stop being irregular!   Kind of like surprising someone when they have hiccups.

t1_dtrqfxw	0.000000	*	You did throw out a dickish comment tho
t1_dt21fp8	-0.226300	*	Except it isn't. A population does not need 100% of its members to procreate. In fact, if everyone procreates it's typically detrimental to the population, because resources are limited.
t1_dtuc0dg	-0.602800	*	But Leftists in the US had to cry big, bad American imperialism!!! I'm not saying we were fighting there out of the goodness of our hearts, but neither was the other side.
t1_dszyrja	-0.670500	*	But I said it was obvious who killed him, and the use of polonium made it more obvious.  It was blatant from the start.
t1_dslbnaq	-0.408000	*	Well, no, I didn't make the original claims, I was replying to your comment. I was hoping to have a discussion with you, but you've unfortunately proven that as something beyond you.

t1_dtodwns	0.870000	*	LMFAO, thank you for the proof that his approval rating isn't 49. Rasmussen is a C- pollster, they're fake news.   Donnies approval rating is 40. 36 if you ask Quinnipiac. 
t1_dswotg0	0.329100	*	On one hand I feel for them because it's a meaningful job that helps the community, but on the other hand it is unfortunate that we have a surplus of teachers and shortage of medical professionals.

t1_dsusfn5	0.440400	*	I mean providing a path to become a citizen is serving non-citizens. It's beneficial for citizens though if it brings in new citizens who can contribute to the economy.
t1_dtjoosy	-0.165500	*	Sorry guys. I hoped that claim was over the top absurd enough to sound intentionally fucked, but I probably overestimate both humanity and the internet. 
t1_dtqolg0	-0.636900	*	Sorry its anti american to dislike the only country that has 6 ongoing invasions and a million civilian deaths under its belt. 
t1_dsrw214	0.818000	*	I get what you're saying and kinda agree. I just get  triggered when people start saying things like Kim is being rational etc. At least I can admit that haha

t1_dt3vsdn	0.126300	*	Barely shook is a bit of an understatement.  It lasted a solid minute and was def moving my house around.

t1_dsxuzuu	0.237300	*	Well then humans never die and this whole analogy is dumb anyway
t1_dtkui3z	0.401900	*	Yes, however physics has more uses. I believe you might be familiar with people claiming allergies to wi-fi for instance.   And physics is a broad term, thats part of the point.
t1_dt93883	0.000000	*	Rasing awareness is the exact opposite of rehab, the whole point is to educate people so they don't put themselves in the situation where they need rehab.
t1_dshshfq	0.712200	*	According to the Dalai Lama, one of the keys to happiness is compassion.  So many people fail to realize this, and never realize how much more fulfilled their lives could be. 
t1_dtivewt	0.827100	*	And it sounds like you think parks are better used for adults to drink and use drugs than for children to have fun.  You know, homeless shelters are a thing.
t1_dtgaf84	-0.585900	*	 He's just a Russian troll desperate to try to spend the both sides are equal argument.  But he's not paid enough to do that kind of work.

t1_dtdq7fz	0.102700	*	While I agree, its not really a precedent since we already have things like Holocaust denial being illegal. 
t1_dtatcpt	0.585900	*	Well, a fine gutentag to you ;)

t1_dsrncjr	-0.476700	*	You're all such defeatists. You want to abandon any pretense of integrity 'because everybody else is doing it'. That's the kind of herd mentality that allowed the Holocaust to happen.
t1_dtsxvv5	-0.440400	*	The nuclear deal was basically an extortion racket put out by the west. They did it so they could lift the sanctions and finally have a civilian weapons program.
t1_dsxk3j9	0.182000	*	You can be a proud American and still be ashamed of your foreign policy.  Or you might even be proud of your foreign policy but don't want to defend it everywhere you go.

t1_dssgynd	-0.848100	*	See my other reply. I do read my Bible, and from what I know of the Q'uran, it's a violent book. The Bible is a violent book. Life today is violent. Both books have an underlying message of peace.

t1_dtje8ov	0.432900	*	Where do you draw the line? Is removing the tip of a finger or toe okay?  Tattooing a svastika or a dickbutt on their forehead?  Removing nipples?  Female circumcision?
t1_dtqied8	-0.458800	*	So did the Italians and Japanese. That's why Italians and Japanese are banned from entering Israel.  edit: Was the /s necessary?

t1_dt2l3do	-0.340000	*	Lots. It contradicts the Big Bang and gives proof of a literal biblical account in todays world.
t1_dthga1e	-0.687000	*	I don't know any of the people who would do that, therefore I cannot provide meaningful insight into what their intent might be.   That's no excuse to project my insecurities unto them though. 
t1_dtw4jep	0.650600	*	Not to detract from the point you're making but the 6th mass extinction event has been in progress for thousands of years. We're not helping things for sure but we're also not the primary cause.
t1_dtm76pk	-0.848100	*	Why are you guys trying to blame communism/fascism/ideologies as the reason why it all failed. 80% of the reason why they fail is because of corruption running through their veins.
t1_dtbb0bs	-0.066100	*	At least he was kinda better in Defenders since others called him out on his stupidity. 
t1_dsns2ag	-0.571900	*	NBCR filters are much more than that.  Some actually begin to release poisonous gasses if they're too old iirc the old M9 filters are toxic to use now.

t1_dslqqru	-0.612400	*	> I was trying to point out how rude and unnecessary calling someone's home a shithole is.  There's literally zero proof Trump even said that. It's literally a sourceless accusation.

t1_dtr8og2	-0.296000	*	Its sad but feeling bad for someone is a lot different than supporting them for 10 years before they contribute to society. 
t1_dsercrz	-0.161100	*	This is not true, the slowdown is due to how batteries behave when they age - and a new battery resolves it.

t1_dt5838e	-0.783700	*	There are a lot of people that are against the pipeline, primarily because tar sands are the most damaging form of oil in the world, and he's still pushing us as a green nation.  Very hypocritical.

t1_dskoe8s	0.421500	*	Slovenia is a nice country
t1_dt8u6x6	-0.414400	*	Their point is a statement most feminists would disagree with. The point of feminism is for women to reach equality. Do you know what equality means?
t1_dt3vbno	0.361200	*	do you know what Lobbying in the united states is?  corrupt beat cop vs corrupt leaders.
t1_dt8wrqp	0.194000	*	Yep, not that it stopped them from suing them either when they went too far to get Kate's topless pictures.
t1_dtp6ljd	0.401900	*	Yes. China does it even more. I don't think you understand how different it is. China is by far the forefront though 
t1_dtijqyi	-0.654200	*	That's a dangerous line of thought. Yes, people like that should be locked away, but torturing them helps no one.

t1_dt4xgun	-0.318200	*	It lost diminutive sense when  was dropped from . It doesn't sound diminutive to me, a native speaker. It's a new word.
t1_dspjax8	-0.043100	*	> his competition literally wants to persecute them  Because they're Nazis. Most of the developed world is OK with that.
t1_dsl3h03	0.401900	*	As far as I know Sadiq didnt meet anyone. The leader of his party did, and that was the premise I was working with.
t1_dtdos6j	-0.077200	*	When those political views are villainous- yes. 
t1_dtsxedb	0.000000	*	I think too often folk in the West have the idea that Iran is some borderline medieval country. When it's just full of normal people doing normal people things.

t1_dssndk6	0.401900	*	Yes, and it's important to remember they both make execution videos for the same reason. To intimidate anyone who would stand against them. It's important we don't let them intimidate us.  
t1_dswz6j2	0.399900	*	well, clearly parents aren't like that anymore, they are indulgent and don't have the balls to take away the IPhone from little Brayden or Dakota.

t1_dsig198	0.526700	*	Sorry, Sir, but yes we are.
t1_dtvuh6y	-0.153100	*	Those are individual countries and not EU as a whole.   Basically like California allowing legal weed which sips illegally inevitably to other countries while Washington's stance is to ban it all.

t1_dtwc9cm	0.000000	*	What about steamed hams?
t1_dt6lr8j	-0.600300	*	How is there less bad priests? This just means more priests. He seems to be under the impression that married priests have les chance to be abusers. This is false.

t1_dt3382b	0.202300	*	That's still a significant majority.  But the larger US ratio explains the initial mental picture of a female nurse, assuming that commenter was from the US.

t1_dtjzesq	0.681600	*	I agree.  There's nothing wrong with a person saying they were wrong either. People can learn from mistakes and errors.  That's how things improve for everyone.
t1_dttefhp	-0.090000	*	How is US the land of the free? Other people summarized it pretty well but you're here trying to defend poor little US from these bullies.
t1_dtmo5ve	-0.655100	*	The Soviet Union wouldn't have been able to even mobilize any defense without lend lease.  Britain would have starved without American help and Indonesia would have been under Japanese control.

t1_dt9vbs1	-0.502300	*	Of course, but the other reply above is exactly the ignorance I'm referencing. Predictable posturing from the left.

t1_dt9n98q	-0.784500	*	So youre saying there is not a single republican in the entire world who isnt stupid or a bad person? Unless you have a source for that claim, you cannot claim that it is not incorrect.

t1_dshoc35	-0.570700	*	And full of terror!
t1_dt4pcd8	0.401900	*	Yea, I'd be interested in results from that method. I think that's more in line with what the pure coding workers do at the largest tech companies.
t1_dsnvd21	0.563500	*	Hey the good news is he doesn't appreciate politically correct talk and can definitely take a joke because he's thick skinned and stable, so he probably won't even take this the wrong way. Right?

t1_dtqfv5k	-0.836000	*	Your post doesnt address anything I said. Put assumptions in my argument I never made. You called me dumb. I concede, you must be right because I must be wrong.

t1_dtoze0q	-0.318200	*	When he's in the jet, he's a combatant. When he's floating, he lost.   It's not complicated. 
t1_dtec9fx	0.202300	*	The whole point of the movie is that sometimes evil wins, just like in life. For that to be the central theme of the movie and have a Hollywood ending makes little sense.

t1_dtbmytt	-0.296000	*	I went in to get a capital one card, Citi card, bank of America etc etc etc. All involved only filling out a form online. No proof of income or anything else that's standard overseas.

t1_dt689pt	0.924300	*	But still, I think everybody's point is that it's a pretty good example of horseshoe theory?  It's not something I really feel like I get, so I'm only pretty sure that's what everyone's saying.

t1_dtjjku4	-0.864100	*	I can only speak for myself. But calling me disfigured is kinda fucked up. Accusing my parents of mutilating me is kinda fucked up.
t1_dt0gec2	-0.440400	*	Eh, they are American weapons made in America by American companies, designed by Germans and manufacuted under license from German companies.

t1_dspl6ix	0.421500	*	No, I think in this case god, or whomever else you want to attribute the universe to, is the one to take the credit.  The engineers have to put a lot of work in, to get it to explode at all.
t1_dsy0h7d	-0.670500	*	Only because he is such a moron, that he deserves to be mocked mercilessly.
t1_dtj81u7	0.421500	*	The people that love to eat them don't seem actually notice the smell.  My brother, for example, is totally unaffected by the smell, while I think they smell like a mixture of feces and death.
t1_dska4bb	0.000000	*	And that's a valid reason to not visit a country?  Didn't he actually make less in real estate than he would have just letting the money sit, or is that just an internet fact?

t1_dti6qdk	0.177900	*	k. thanks for your insightful thoughts containing literally no substantiate information whatsoever.  Your comment really swayed me. 
t1_dt0jwut	0.172500	*	No, if you're poor you need to keep working so you increase the labor surplus and drive down the price. That way the elites keep getting even richer.
t1_dsiqsxq	-0.542300	*	wewww, that's an expensive fuck up.
t1_dsqisyt	0.165500	*	Sure, but that also doesn't require treating their word as gospel - especially if you aren't an investigator and instead are a media/news organisation.
t1_dslcipm	0.358200	*	It's really not. That would mean that you were free to just waltz right into my house. That wouldn't end well as I'm one of those Murica type of Americans.

t1_dskb5d3	0.000000	*	I dont think you know what liberalism is.
t1_dtxf3ed	0.467800	*	I find it hard to see it happen, but I feel like the pieces will somehow fall in to place for it to happen.  I guess we just wait and see.
t1_dswt685	-0.476700	*	America's image was always terrible. Trump just showed that when you think you're at rockbottom... you can still sink so much deeper.
t1_dsdoz2i	0.318200	*	That's a fair comment. 
t1_dtny41t	-0.165500	*	You already dismissed any sources before I provided any, and then presume to be in a position to ask for sources. I would call you intellectually dishonest, but Id only be half right. 
t1_dtjibka	0.570700	*	My daughter had surgery last week and the anesthesiologist told her this joke to calm her down as she was scared. It's a quality joke!

t1_dtbldjz	0.273200	*	Oh my God I'm dying 
t1_dtvvlot	0.410900	*	My experience was comparable. We were doing 5 week shifts at a remote radar base. 12 to 14 hours every day of the week, but there wasn't anything else to do or anywhere to go so it was okay.

t1_dtirvbz	-0.049800	*	Maybe if you were more serious about these topics, instead of treating them sarcastically and as a matter of pride for yourself, you'd see some of the trends going on for yourself.
t1_dtjmthh	0.000000	*	They *did* use gas chambers: They're one of the few nations in the world who ever did.  They just never used them to gas jews.  The US *still* uses gas chambers as a form of execution *to this day.*
t1_dslx29r	-0.241100	*	Because if I say they're black then I'm being condescending apparently. I guess because I come from a middle class white family.   Can't please everyone I guess

t1_dtbze77	-0.472400	*	You said to be fair as if you're cutting people a break for being biased. The status quo is not the ideal.

t1_dtm07vy	0.001800	*	Course. Im just saying I dont think its the best argument. If all systems are flawed in practice, saying communism is also flawed isnt really damning.

t1_dsei0wr	0.000000	*	I don't believe so.  I believe it depends upon battery age and performance.  That is why they are offering people battery replacements.  That's the gist of what I have read too.

t1_dskvg4n	0.000000	*	Yea that 9% black population.  Staggering.
t1_dstvoir	-0.885500	*	That's not how the law works.  For starters, these Palestinian terrorists, are not part of a group, do not wear uniforms, hide their weapons, and mascaraed as civilians.  Those are all war crimes.

t1_dt987is	-0.659700	*	They always say this. Just ignore it. It's supposed to put the burden on the reader to disprove some total fabrication their bosses just told them to spout.

t1_dsjzflp	-0.115400	*	I generally agree with that, but southerners also tend to be pretty racist and uneducated too, so...
t1_dsz8gbj	0.049000	*	It's relevant as far as Americans can't do things like universal healthcare, because there are groups who are actively opposed to other people having healthcare access.

t1_dt3pwxx	-0.659700	*	The problem I have is that they cherry pick the warcrimes they prosecute and never go for higher-ups.   Why not let the tribunal in The Hague decide and give everyone an equal treatment?
t1_dsvanuj	0.000000	*	What's your point? 
t1_dt2qunp	0.458800	*	But also remember that Genesis was written in pre-davidic Hebrew. The literal translation is period of time. I'm honestly not 100% how we ended up with the modern translation of day.

t1_dtr3egd	-0.296000	*	No.
t1_dt9hwal	-0.381800	*	First, I want to kill no one. Second I was in agreement with Yertley speaking about someone else. Third, you clearly have no grasp of the word assuaged or its place in a sentence.

t1_dsklgld	0.000000	*	BBC Cymru is the Welsh one
t1_dsdmho5	0.226300	*	Like I said, there's no way to know that's true. There's no history to learn from here.

t1_dsjugbk	0.000000	*	I never said it wasn't. All I said is that a person should not feel unsafe coming to America.
t1_dswe18a	0.000000	*	Has he now.
t1_dstj1di	0.000000	*	130 countries recognizing Palestine doesn't magically make Palestine a sovereign and independent state.
t1_dtwwrfw	-0.273200	*	yeah he ordered a military dick parade. 
t1_dtf3wtx	0.401900	*	Yes. Why did santa use bin bags instead of stockings to put my presents in and have the same handwriting as my mum? 
t1_dtp3duo	0.570900	*	It's shaped more like a horseshoe than a straight line spectrum, meaning there are many similarities between socialism and fascism.  That being said, fascism is still a right wing political ideology
t1_dtc0clk	-0.308900	*	wait orly what do you mean it doesn't help
t1_dtl2ubp	0.000000	*	I don't buy meat
t1_dtodptn	-0.851600	*	I wouldnt call them the most shittiest presidents, just shitty. I don't think they beat Warren Hardin, James Buchanan, Andrew Jackson, and Franklin Pierce.
t1_dto9fzg	-0.663200	*	That's not true, the land that was not tribal was split about 50/50 between the black and white population. (Though that was still of course unfair, with whites only making up 8% of the population)
t1_dtmjs3p	0.881400	*	> But with the warmaking capability SA has purchased from the USA, they could overrun the country in a day if they felt like that would be in their best interest  Are you joking or is this serious ?

t1_dsxommv	-0.413700	*	So.. we should deny them ei or something?  If everyone involved is a consenting adult, why shouldnt it be tolerated? 
t1_dt74nmf	0.226300	*	Are you considering the opportunity cost of equivalent wages when in school, but not working, for their skill level and hours worked?
t1_dtijduh	-0.849500	*	Geneva Convention lays out the process of treating prisoners of war, and it does not include giving each of them a trial.
t1_dtrernr	0.557400	*	Good point. Growing up rural, Wal-Mart was only 20 min away in a few different directions. Before Wal-Marts boomed in our area, a drive to the nearest city was 2 hours. 
t1_dtwecd0	0.440400	*	How is that even related to the topic at hand. Which US companies couldn't sell what panels where exactly, and what does that have to do with the tariffs the EU imposed on panels made in China?
t1_dsm1zgv	-0.296000	*	You can refuse to vote for something you helped write.  Voting and writing are two different actions.  I can't believe this had to be explained.
t1_dt8wpww	0.000000	*	Through Taiwan, Japan, and possibly the Phillipines

t1_dsehd4e	0.440400	*	I agree, and I this is a difficult issue to fix.  Maybe debates with an emphasis on civility?  That would make the talking heads have to behave better. 
t1_dskujmh	0.895700	*	Don't forget our Gun Safety laws.  Europeans love those as well.  
t1_dsi9318	0.765000	*	Oh yes, I remember the audio recording of Obama talking about how he would grope men because he was the president and they loved the power he had
t1_dsyiml2	-0.542300	*	Yea that would have worked if any decent brand prioritized battery time over stupidly thin phones. Until then I will keep complaining as much as I want.
t1_dt2wupm	-0.187700	*	you will never convince someone who has already made up their mind.
t1_dt6xa29	-0.121500	*	If the government is imposing a law onto facebook then it doesnt matter if facebook is a private institution because the law came from the government and not from facebook.

t1_dtvduku	0.612400	*	Your original point was that lions were caged. They're clearly not. 
t1_dtn61lp	0.757900	*	> you and your friends would all be up in arms and protesting in the streets.  It's amazing how easily they've made you see the majority of the world as 'others'. 
t1_dt3kux0	-0.458800	*	Yes, there are a lot of *really* stupid people in our country, unfortunately.  In no way does that imply that Trump is competent.  (Hint: He's not.) 
t1_dttap7q	-0.193000	*	Everyone pays into it and the amount is miniscule and certainly not sufficient to kill the poor. Wtf are you talking about?

t1_dtvp8w8	0.000000	*	Uk I have waited 6 hours
t1_dsz1arm	-0.690800	*	You think people stop thinking when they sleep?  Some scientist you are.  You're too ignorant to even argue with.
t1_dspgc8d	-0.526700	*	To quote his comment history, the left have been copying the rights conspiracy theories about Clinton to throw back at Trump
t1_dsncwiu	0.401900	*	Are you telling me you don't know a lot of special snowflakes on the left?
t1_dspcjoz	0.000000	*	What an eco-friendly apocalypse.

t1_dsdlc83	0.219300	*	That's quite the sentence!
t1_dtoayd5	0.304000	*	Because for all I know she might have perfectly valid points. I'm not trying to argue against her post as a whole, I'm just criticizing that one specific strawman argument.

t1_dttzi39	-0.848100	*	The opiate thing is bad. Kills so many people. They turn my stomach a mess(luckily?) so I do use cannabis to relieve pain. I find edibles work much better for the pain than inhaling it.
t1_dt9y3e5	0.567600	*	Declining to host a speaker on a college campus is not forcibly silencing someone. Milo is free to publish and speak all the stuff he wants. Just not at that particular school on that particular day. 
t1_dsxunxu	0.000000	*	Fuuuuck, they're Nazis?
t1_dsurbfm	-0.153100	*	The irony is you see this as an insult to Trump supporters and not a reflection on who you keep company with
t1_dsm718n	0.690800	*	Well trump grew up a spoiled rich brat the same as he still is today so you can rule out the meat wasnt safe case
t1_dsisvd0	0.177900	*	Totally with you. Many friends don't talk anymore. It's crazy.
t1_dsn2uwp	-0.928200	*	Would you mind clarifying your post?  When you say violence on the right it could mean violence by the right or violence against the right.  Which do you mean?
t1_dtovvyc	0.401900	*	Mom, I find it interesting that you call *The Weekly World News* the paper. The paper contains facts.

t1_dtvpn7m	0.492600	*	Ouch! Lol silly boy
t1_dsuu3vy	0.296000	*	Hmmm ok. I guess I never really thought about India and Pakistan being in the Middle East. I think those are mostly considered to be Asian/southeast Asian countries. 
t1_dsl0bny	0.151300	*	Oh I fully agree I mean look at Hollywood, they have no room to talk 
t1_dsjb3vf	0.000000	*	Don't tell us what to do or we'll fucking eat you too, bud.
t1_dstcbdm	0.401900	*	And he probably thought that the black vote wouldnt be there in an off-year special election.

t1_dsdrtgf	0.680800	*	Not sure where you're getting the last part of your argument from, or how it is at all relevant.  In any case, hope your day gets better.
t1_dt77rdd	-0.585900	*	Why? I would pay more personal taxes in exchange for a lower corporate tax rate. Lower corporate tax rates=more revenue=more growth=more jobs.

t1_dsfz1nz	0.000000	*	Is there a mobile version?
t1_dshen2l	0.772100	*	Union still isn't a dirty word.  Also why would you bother creating an entirely new Union when you can just join an existing one?  Nobody creates a Union, you join a Union.

t1_dtoojh2	0.000000	*	I'm not claiming there aren't major overlaps between Western and Eastern cultures, but they are distinct enough to separate the two.
t1_dtw0zd8	0.000000	*	In US politics, the donkey represents the Democrats and the elephant represents the Republicans. Believe it or not, they actually have mascots.
t1_dt57450	0.273200	*	The solution is to make the law so you are allowed to smoke outside. I'm totally on the landlord's side of no smoking inside, but with so much of the population renting that's pretty ridiculous.

t1_dtqlbs1	0.025800	*	Dutch law says whoever pays for the subscription is responsible for it. No exceptions. Held up in court  So it really differs per country and also among EU members.

t1_dtc8z5p	-0.619900	*	Why should we accept immigrants from these places? If you can't stand the backwards racists in Alabama, why would you want the 1000% worse version in these countries to be in your community?
t1_dsewdsa	0.000000	*	You're right. Why the previous administrations not uphold their duty to the American people is a real issue.
