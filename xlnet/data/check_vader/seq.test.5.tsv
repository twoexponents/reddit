t1_dv08exl	0.151100	*	Being socially conservative is not a crime....   I mean I disagree with social conservatives in 90% of the cases, but you make it seem as if being socially conservative makes you less democratic.
t1_dv3mpt8	0.318200	*	Those sure are words. Not proof, though. 
t1_duzbft2	0.273200	*	Snopes? Might as well quote the back of a cereal box.
t1_duswt92	0.296000	*	The metaphor stuff is a joke - or did I just assume that.
t1_duo23n0	0.700300	*	If only we had this network of orbiting spy satellites that were capable of picking out the license plate number of a car.  Surely that could be utilized to track and deal with oceanic poaching.
t1_duo92td	0.510600	*	If it gives him attention and makes the Russian populace realize there can be opposition to Putin, by all means I encourage it.
t1_duca4ix	0.000000	*	Fuck... why did I have 3 kids?!
t1_dv4wy5f	-0.624900	*	Literally the only relevant evidence to potentially tie Trump or his family or advisors to a child sex scandal and that copypasta of irrelevance missed it. 
t1_durqrsp	-0.401900	*	Hopefully your summer is fucked too, Spartan 
t1_duy2noh	0.001800	*	Yeah I wanted to troll /u/Epuration_legale making it look like there really was some sort of conspiracy with sockpuppet accounts

t1_dunu5m2	-0.241100	*	9/10 times when I go to McDonald's I get my drink in a foam cup. Every McDonald's around me still uses them. I'm not sure about the breakfast platters because I never get them. 
t1_duq7smk	0.273200	*	They practically committed genocide against the Ukrainians and others.  I can't think of many redeeming qualities for the Soviet Union.
t1_dufbdit	0.000000	*	Source?  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_genital_mutilation mentions nothing of the sort that I saw.
t1_duxddw7	0.000000	*	We'll call it a tie for last then. IIRC your laws around alcohol are just as nutty as ours, correct? Government monopoly and whatnot.
t1_duudwkx	0.035200	*	This seemingly irrelevant nonsense is why I like reading legal stories. Fucking lawyers will argue about any small thing. I like it.
t1_dv3bfv5	-0.895700	*	Reddit harbors far-left breeding grounds that regularly call for violence and hate. What makes you think reddit will censor any political sub? 
t1_duormi3	-0.670500	*	The Nazis killed people based of off who they were, not the beliefs that they held.
t1_dufi51v	-0.648600	*	and a way to launch dead cows
t1_duqbfye	-0.364300	*	They might not but the American people do and as much as it doesn't seem like it, we're who matters.
t1_dubmvct	0.440400	*	I know, and that is a problem... (But try and go to one of the t_D controlled subs, air a serious liberal viewpoint, and count your upvotes on one hand, without fingers)
t1_duosa6q	0.296000	*	The few Russians I know are batshit crazy. But none of them are rich.
t1_duaa3pe	-0.228000	*	Almost no one would build there any way. Poland, Slovakia, Czech Republic are places big players build now.
t1_dumwfh7	-0.542300	*	The point is to verify sources and info, not to parrot anything you hear. That's what the elderly/less internet savvy/uneducated fail to do.
t1_dunh29g	0.215900	*	Literally none? Sorry but I wouldn't agree to marginally better military occupation either. 
t1_duuczgx	0.000000	*	Control + Alt + Defleet

t1_duq8zrf	0.401900	*	As far as I can tell, they're building up support in the Middle East, solidifying power in Eastern Europe, and trying to destabilize the the EU.

t1_duci62q	-0.318200	*	It allegedly is an ode from growers to our struggle for independence, which was led by William of Orange. 
t1_dum9yrx	0.950900	*	Are you surprised? Totally speculating here, but Switzerland is one of the wealthiest countries in the world, and rich people have less of an incentive to accept corruption.
t1_duk7mfp	-0.458800	*	> US **internal** news/US politics  News about the U.S. and Russia is not internal, so the rules don't anything about U.S. news being banned.

t1_duorrgq	0.000000	*	Joint operation?  I thought it was coke?
t1_duymo99	-0.697900	*	Deleting things with the purpose of hiding evidence is a crime.  It doesn't matter what your job is.
t1_duqm4b4	-0.755900	*	They must, because everyone gets so absolutely shocked every time Trump does something only a dumbass would do.
t1_duyk4ux	-0.762000	*	No, that was the 30 years of political hatchetry by the GOP that caused 90% of that disdain. The remaining is what literally every politician every where is. She's nothing special in that regard.
t1_dumyszl	0.000000	*	Thought that was really fucking odd... i live here and it is a bastion for foreign money.

t1_duot11o	0.000000	*	Because then you use it all up in one week-long sitting.
t1_duk3pmj	0.659700	*	You guys forgot the natural resources those countries have, similar to Canada, they have oil and their profits from those oils are in a national fund.
t1_dv06kbr	0.636900	*	No, politicians and the super wealthy. How much money do you think professors make?

t1_dud0126	0.000000	*	Carrie went a little overboard but still 1158 messages is a little more than smalltalk. This women shouldve divorced if she was that into another guy
t1_duv2il8	0.226300	*	I don't think that's the issue people have with your comment.  You're taking a serious political stance on an elaborate joke, and downvotes are their way of saying *woosh*.

t1_dut6fam	-0.680800	*	Um no. I do think that it would be stupid to alienate your biggest contributor though. Particularly when a lot of your other members are on the same page about a nuclear armed N.K. 
t1_durc1h4	0.250000	*	Americans know little of their own, terrible history.    It's rare to find a country own up to its atrocities.  Germany did a great job after WWII.  But they are the exception.

t1_duph3bp	0.374400	*	She may even punch and divorce you if you talk down on her one too many times. So you're lacking free speech as well. Shame, isn't it?
t1_duyjkt9	0.000000	*	>Extremist category   Nope. Normal for developed countries. 
t1_duiix6o	0.000000	*	Especially when the Trump administration calculated 400k/yr as the middle class.
t1_dv44nh9	0.000000	*	I don't know what he uses, but if you install [RES](https://redditenhancementsuite.com/) you get a source link under any comment to see what they actually typed without any formatting.
t1_dur23sy	0.389200	*	Thanks for going against the jerk here. This is at the very least an argument that should be met with something more than downvotes and ad hominem.   Too much adoration for billionaires on Reddit. 
t1_dup0zzs	0.838100	*	I'll be honest it was a a typo but when god smiles down on you with gold you sorta roll with it.
t1_duzzq0r	-0.902200	*	Yup its pathetic. Voting for hate. A bit similar to far right people voting for hate against immigrants, latinos etc.
t1_dunrkrd	0.000000	*	Yeltsin really set the bar low... even Trump couldve improved Russia after how badly it was at the end of the 90's
t1_due9nei	0.000000	*	So we should sometimes never do what IMF says?

t1_dv3fk91	-0.907200	*	Re: the extreme left, politics isn't a good comparison to T_D but I personally got banned from r/LateStageCapitalism for advocating against violence.

t1_dv20wj0	0.000000	*	Born on 3rd base, thought he hit a triple 
t1_dulruc1	-0.177900	*	Idk, apparently it's any drug addict or drug dealer.  Find the right part of town and you could make some serious money. 
t1_dv0v051	0.284600	*	You laugh but there really is big organic and they push a lot of pseudo science to get people to buy their all natural crap that still has garbage in it except it's overpriced now.

t1_duaz7zc	-0.904200	*	I think you're 100% overstating the competence of American leadership before Trump. A line of crooks and war criminals before a dumbass isn't exactly setting the bar high.

t1_durhxxz	0.000000	*	ESPECIALLY, replanting the forests

t1_duza8q7	0.526700	*	Would that just be obstruction of justice?
t1_dupj8r9	0.000000	*	I think you mean the 70s. The 80s were probably the most conservative time in modern Iranian history, since that was immediately following the revolution.

t1_dv5h8xr	0.000000	*	Yes. It's called radar. Problem with that - Earth is a sphere, and radars can't see through Earth's surface.
t1_dupeyv7	-0.718400	*	You abandoned that welfare 'argument' immediately.  At least we're on the non-starter of immigration though.  Jesus wept, trolls used to try at least.
t1_dv01tu6	0.680800	*	Then you truly have American values and should run for President regardless of left or right
t1_dulg33e	0.000000	*	South Carolina, US
t1_dv5qh8g	0.831600	*	We have other parties like libertarian and green party. Problem is the two major parties do everything they can to keep them out of debates and off ballots.

t1_duhremu	0.000000	*	Just a suggestion, ISPs in Italy are required to keep all traffic metadata for 6 (six) years.
t1_duenxom	0.763000	*	No need for the UK to protect them. Russia protects them just fine by not having any bullshit extradition treaties with anyone.
t1_duwkfs2	0.557400	*	And yet it works for many european countries. Let the free market play itself out here, artificially limiting the number of doctors trained isnt helping anyone but the docs themselves.
t1_dua4xbq	-0.458800	*	Dunblane 1996 I think. Resulted in guns being essentially banned in the country.
t1_dua5npq	-0.607500	*	>It is possible to do a forced acquisition or buy back of the guns in circulation  I'm not sure it would be in America.
t1_dua6bvl	-0.848100	*	And so... someone who is planning on killing a bunch of people would have a moral quandary to buy a gun illegally?  So more gun restrictions is the key....

t1_duiyvxb	0.552000	*	So you got a free haircut, right?

t1_duywqjk	0.361200	*	It reads like something out of Mean Girls.   Is there an extension to change Putin to Regina George on Trump Tweets?
t1_dv2nkl4	0.000000	*	I mean.... Hitler was nominated once, so... Yea. 
t1_duq6yqg	0.153100	*	Yeah, my personal life actually hasn't changed significantly at all since Trump was elected.  I just talk about it more and read about it more, but my day to day life is the same.
t1_dv2m2lk	0.224700	*	Bushs administration is not Trumps. This is a different beast entirely. I would be very happy to be proven wrong though.
t1_duphzrb	-0.275500	*	Couldn't agree more. America's largest flaw is it's us vs. them attitude when it comes to government. It is the single most contributing factor in our decline as a Nation.

t1_dv018re	-0.757900	*	If the government in this case (and institution) is being bigoted against a marginalised group (boers are a small minoirty in SA) then even by the dumb definitions this is just straight up racism.

t1_duaanh5	-0.959500	*	Same thing could be said about Trump, but we already knew how bad he was and how bad itd get before the vote and people voted for him anyways.    The gullible and ignorant know no bounds or borders.

t1_dv1pod9	-0.338400	*	You're so naive. 
t1_due0tiq	0.557400	*	Depends on context - make the title about democrats reacting to the Nunez memo or the point where Russians targeted the left as well and they'll eat it up like candy.

t1_dv2c400	0.659700	*	People spending money creates jobs.   Feel free to start a career in underwater basket weaving if you don't believe me. But you'll very quickly find out that you live in a consumption driven economy.

t1_dufqe85	0.373600	*	You think Israel somehow surprised Iran by taking out that drone? Israel actually ended up losing a jet in this operation. Why are you supporting this posturing bafoon?
t1_dujxyr8	0.273200	*	Well /r/conspiracy has basically become T_D 2.0 these days, so I would take anything there with a bag of salt.

t1_dv4sf28	-0.362600	*	Part of the problem is when people talk about politicians in general. It's very clear who's at fault here.

t1_dulqt81	-0.761200	*	As I said, he's more constrained by institutions, but there's no evidence he is fundamentally different. One is violent authoritarianism in action, the other is the promise of it.

t1_dudvjem	0.790600	*	Because government knows better the expenses to invent the new drug. Yeah elected clerk knows everything better.  
t1_duirvt2	0.421500	*	Second sentence is true, but because of false presumptions, second sentence is not, as the two sentences are completely unrelated.
t1_duj5mvq	0.000000	*	>70% of population  Ha-ha.
t1_duzb704	-0.273200	*	Plus in 20 years most of those politicians will be dead anyway, so why would they care about future infrastructure needs?

t1_duv7dpx	-0.275500	*	It's not like they don't use pesticides in organic farming, either. They just use different ones.

t1_dui6kle	0.000000	*	Probably by just having them.
t1_duge8en	-0.758400	*	Not really, it's just somewhat hypocritical for an expansionist nation that is actively illegally occupying other nation's land to make an argument based on the need to curtail illegal immigration. 
t1_duyt8k1	0.202300	*	The whole administration is steeped in recursive irony on so many levels that it's hard not to believe it's a Shakesperian play.
t1_dula70b	-0.296000	*	No,  Capitol refers to that one hill in DC upon which the building of the Congress was built and not generally the city where the governments are which is called capital.

t1_dudzn5z	-0.295100	*	Well, the FBI will spend over a year to get a couple Russian trolls but won't bother to investigate emails destroyed after being subpoenaed. Someone ought to find those emails.

t1_duc2quk	0.168000	*	Telling me even the trees are trying to kill people down there? I mean do you have anything nice and friendly to offer the rest of the world?
t1_dugcmbo	0.000000	*	Where are you from if I may ask?
t1_dv3cdva	0.318200	*	For sure they let you voice it, you just get downvoted for not going along with the narrative.

t1_duxkusm	0.557400	*	People like this aren't worried about pleasing God. They are worried about keeping up appearances for other people. 
t1_duutp2y	0.671200	*	I never understood that mentally. Same with the GOP and DNC. Why would you blindly support your choosen party? If I would be part of a party I would be even more critical of everything they do.
t1_dusxnus	-0.440400	*	This is BS. After WW2 the US never policed the world. The US, just like Russia, just fucked with it.
t1_dubnphe	-0.585900	*	I could see most of it aside from Russian-Islamic alliance.  That part doesn't seem possible, they'd just as soon stab each other in the back.  Which would probably be the longer term goal.

t1_duhzjdl	0.571300	*	The positive goals in Brexit are an investment that doesn't pay off till at LEAST (and probably not for some time after that) when they actually leave the EU.  We are in a transitory stage.

t1_duyre81	0.000000	*	Right, but you've also stated ITT that it has nothing to do with the situation in the US. Which is it?

t1_dukpm5t	0.401900	*	They definitely do not and we the SKoreans know it.
t1_duptbio	-0.202300	*	Makes sense.  Enormous gains by one entity, relative to others, is usually a symptom of another entity being screwed over.

t1_ducvext	0.446600	*	Are you saying its OK that Putin did it because Obama did?
t1_duum04q	-0.584900	*	Not really, its just a really bad system from a mathematical point of view. In the metric system, everything adds up.
t1_dund6ps	0.000000	*	I don't see why not but I think why nothing has been tried is because how fragile the flora and fauna is in Oz. I have heard their import laws concerning plants and animals are very strick.

t1_duuvkih	0.401900	*	There are definitely downsides to it too. 
t1_dua9vu1	0.102700	*	The law doesnt require one.   There is no technically. The law is clear and direct on this.

t1_duymkai	-0.688700	*	It's almost too comical though. He'll contradict himself in the same sentence and you wonder if he's really that stupid or if it's part of a bigger plan i.e. not to get elected or reelected

t1_dv4u0oc	0.292400	*	We live in a scary world if all you need is an allegation (especially without names) to condemn someone. That's a slippery slope my friend. 
t1_dv00pge	0.502300	*	Not only they are seizing property, but they're seizing it from the most productive people. That's like a double red flag for investors.

t1_duks4im	-0.831600	*	They can. The US and the UK have both shown that they don't do anything about Russian agents murdering defectors and critics on their borders. The RT founder for example.
t1_dv272za	0.000000	*	Nyet, komrad
t1_duv55ch	-0.680800	*	But it is using software.  Aws, azure and Google cloud platform are a whole hell of a lot more than just bank after bank of NAS.

t1_ducrupx	-0.891000	*	I mean, twitter WAS a mistake. I am not saying reddit is the golden bastion of social media, but dumb people use twitter, so dumb opinions spread.

t1_dui3eb7	-0.296000	*	No. Where did you get that from my words?
t1_dv37hhj	0.428200	*	So a hostile power secretly providing support for a political candidate by pretending to be American citizens doesn't scare you?

t1_duk0uxr	0.628300	*	It's called class warfare, it doesn't matter if the top does nothing and steals the profit made by the workers. Since they have the power, they decide the rules.
t1_duhu7g3	-0.476700	*	> While you 're correct  he is not correct, he is just plain wrong
t1_dulhlpq	-0.173400	*	You are literally lying. He is not denying anything. He says estimates are not flat 6 million but rather between 5.29-6.2 millions. 
t1_duje5bk	0.051600	*	Nobody brought up either of those things other than you two. It seems it's true, at a certain point you cross that line and become what you hate. 
t1_dux9plf	0.839600	*	Reddit is the second most popular social media site in the United States, and I believe the fourth most visited site overall.  Reddit is extremely popular.

t1_dv3ac9r	-0.102700	*	Freedom of speech is a hell of a thing, and reddit has, in my opinion, done a bang up job protecting our speech.
t1_dumnfp5	0.000000	*	Not all Turkish tribes were of Asian ethnicity, thats a more recent development. A lot of the tribes were Caucasian.

t1_duzdh4h	-0.612400	*	That's a complete lack of understanding of basic economics. China is overdue for a routine economic crash.

t1_dujkd0f	0.624900	*	It has always been normal. Sure, before Trump it was easier to delude yourself about your social status and your political influence. But that's the only difference.
t1_duz00qe	0.025800	*	No form on government makes correct decisions. At least with democracy the people are responsible since it's what they voted.

t1_dumdbkb	-0.381800	*	You just listed off policies you disagree with instead of corruption.  I don't think you know what corruption is.
t1_dusouvk	-0.250000	*	Meh, the Republican congress is allowing this to happen through slipshod governing.   This is in bad faith with the people who elected them. 
t1_dufgp0f	-0.318200	*	except noone will have any idea wtf someone is talking about. Hit a mountain is straight to the point. No pun intended lol.

t1_duo6hwz	0.000000	*	Look up Sendya bud. People fleeing out of Ghouta will 100% be picked up by authorities. From there their fate is in the hands of whatever commander is in charge. Many are wanted by the state 
t1_durke28	0.566100	*	Arent schools a drug free zone? Nicotine inside the vapes would count wouldnt it?
t1_dus1ehv	-0.296000	*	Yea there's just nowhere to go.  What are you going to do, walk to the middle of nowhere and camp out?  There's no water or food... 
t1_ducxi8b	0.000000	*	That's counting page views. Most of Twitter's interactions are now happening on native mobile apps via the API.
t1_dumuw1w	-0.102700	*	I wouldn't call that a straw man. I'd say that claiming facebook ads and internet trolls cost Hillary the election is grasping at straws rather than accepting defeat.

t1_dut6w7u	0.493900	*	erm, yes for the people who want a place to raise a family, a stable dictatorship is better than civil war and somalia style anarchy.

t1_dv4dl5o	-0.612400	*	The sad difference between the left and the right is, both sides have their crazy racists, but only one side has pushed them to the presidency.
t1_dujincz	0.624000	*	Red states are statistically uneducated.  The defunding if education in red states will go down next to the southern strategies as one of the GOPs most brilliant strategies.
t1_dupjkn4	-0.386200	*	It would still be irresponsible to do so in a healthy economy. Deficit spending is for economic downturns.
t1_dui8r4b	-0.756800	*	So?  Income inequality is a poor metric to use in your argument as it is not clear that that prevents people below from rising upward.
t1_dv0m5eq	-0.440400	*	> I'll go hide under the skirts of my nightmarish police state.  NSA and no customer protection laws say what?

t1_duwsth1	-0.701700	*	Its not even gallows humor, Reddit is always full of stupid jokes that are upvoted regardless of the topic. The reality is that most people just dont give a shit and hence, crack jokes. 
t1_duy9d4h	-0.250000	*	Were you being sarcastic?
t1_duoty67	-0.226300	*	Exactly.  How many promises from 2006 do you recall, or feel outraged they were completed?

t1_dupvctn	0.000000	*	Exactly that.
t1_duuqn45	0.000000	*	What is the point of that technicality? Kinda irrelevent.  Reminds me of a tactic used against the theory of climate change. 
t1_dv17gq1	0.257100	*	Canoeing on a still lake in the morning during the summer... Pure bliss. There really is nothing better 
t1_duo56zm	-0.790600	*	It's proof that the society was never that civilized in the first place. So why don't you work to fix the problem instead of just beating the victims down?
t1_duydqdb	-0.422200	*	You're kidding, right? Do you not read the news or browse reddit? Watch NPR?  Your claim about Republicans is proof of the very thing you're denying.

t1_duvzhmg	-0.933100	*	I agree as well. Political extremists are dangerous, but shooting them is not alway the best way to deal with the threat. In this case shooting them would probably just make it a lot worse.
t1_durxo7v	-0.411800	*	Right? US-backed airstrikes and Iraqi artillery have killed thousands and thousands of civilians so far, as has Russia but they're the only time these stories make it to the front page
t1_dv3b2w8	-0.095100	*	These are not mutually exclusive things
t1_dv2ov5q	0.000000	*	The reason Israel holds the West Bank is the Arabs invaded Israel from it. The reason Israel holds the Golan Heights is because the Syrians used the Heights to lob artillery shells into Israel.
t1_dusk38w	-0.070800	*	Ok, maybe you should just skip middle age and go straight to the retirement home. You've obviously given up. Just put this fool in front of a tv screen until he dies. 
t1_dumm740	0.507000	*	Then the school is more than welcome to apply the rules?
t1_duv2uz4	0.361200	*	I think amphetamines. The list of side effects for long term amphetamine use reads like a personality profile of Trump.

t1_dufj534	0.476700	*	Well, there's a 50% chance they were right..
t1_dv2624l	-0.340000	*	India supplies 2%, and China is below India. Probably a difference of how you round. Either way, China's direct steel exports to the US is insignificant.

t1_dub7p1g	-0.373600	*	So what's the difference b/w American forces and Russian forces here? Both are foreign forces backing different players in  Syrian  politics. Why are the  American troops being portrayed as victims?

t1_dupjfdf	-0.261700	*	I agree with you, but that has nothing to do with falsifying history. Not in a manner where it has huge impact on todays society (like black jesus, who gives a fuck even if he was purple).
t1_dua6w02	-0.923100	*	I have no idea why you're downvoted for this, because you're correct.   Diet, smoking & achohol is the killers. The reason for the over-usage of bad food, smoking & alcohol is poverty.

t1_duvnpvx	0.000000	*	I think GBR is done. It will never be in the same form. It breaks my heart.  But there may be other parts of the world where reefs can form. I'm thinking of the Arafura sea, for example.

t1_dv40k6b	-0.340000	*	How so? Be specific.   I'd argue they treated him with kid gloves the whole time. The theft of the Clinton campaign's voter data illustrates that succinctly.

t1_duzxlaj	-0.771700	*	The Hutu and Tutsi have had long-standing rivalries and conflicts going back for generations. The Rwandan genocide was just a culmination of an extensive back-and-forth of violence.

t1_duxj0ih	0.273200	*	It would've been significantly harder, because he'd have to reach a fairly high lvl before a permission would been granted. Not that it would be impossible by any means.

t1_ductywg	-0.585900	*	In fact, the deputy AG explicitly stated there is no proof any Americans were complicit in this plot. It's either something OP snuck in there to push his narrative or his is misinformed.

t1_dud3hfb	0.718400	*	Because they weren't trying to specifically elect a republican, they tried helping Bernie win also, they just wanted anyone except Hillary in there.
t1_duyi2z6	0.493900	*	Might as well. At this point it's a person cult. Not surprising, he was a celebrity first.

t1_duxel51	-0.719200	*	That's the dumbest semantic argument ever.   You're essentially saying:  Ivanka cooked the food, but didn't serve it. Therefore we can't truly say she made dinner.

t1_duq6p0m	0.904200	*	Awesome. Party affiliation shouldn't mean much to the investigation. Anyone, losing or winning side, proven to have been a part of corruption, should be nabbed. I'm talking ideals of course lol.
t1_dv0b1pf	0.275500	*	I don't think the world flinches anymore when hearing of another mass shooting in the US. If it's not at a school, I doubt it even makes the news outside the US.

t1_dui4auv	-0.510600	*	Thats not a conclusion to the political question.  Gates and liberals want *more* progressive whereas Koch and conservatives want less. This debate will exist until the death of civilization.
t1_dupjp16	-0.886200	*	Don't put things like not trying to be insensitive when looking for a serious response. People most likely assume you're actually apathetic, or sarcastically degrading the act as pointless.

t1_duxfqgy	0.431800	*	No, it's people carrying on in this thread like their countries have never done anything wrong.  Sometimes we need to look at our own histories before baying for blood.

t1_duldh0z	-0.407100	*	I don't think that's true. I think *most* people have good morals, they just may not be great at teaching open-mindedness.

t1_dua9kpj	-0.179600	*	Oh she is in jail. A very special jail where her cunt has to wake up every morning knowing she lost to Donald Trump. Her speech a day later showed just how wonderfully broken we left her.  
t1_dusdtnp	0.168000	*	>Syria as a country  That's what I meant. Is Yugoslavia still around? Czechoslovakia? The US, Russia, Turkey want to divide the place into spheres of influence.

t1_duj71kc	0.899900	*	I'm fairly sure Putin would still win without rigging the system. He might just rig it to make his victory more impressive though, the guy is all about looking powerful.

t1_duta5kl	-0.374000	*	There is no such guarantee actually. The US Taiwan relations act only guarantees aid if China invaded unilaterally, and does not promise direct military aid. The language was left intentionally vague.

t1_dv2qzz3	0.476700	*	It was a very very slim majority. As far as I'm concerned it's 50/50. Trump currently has an approval rating of 40%. That speaks for itself. Half of the US are a bunch of fucking idiots.

t1_dug5k9w	-0.676100	*	It's not a joke. Reagan happened once, and everyone let themselves get suckered by Trump. I'm not surprised at anything Americans do anymore. 
t1_dur3npr	0.372400	*	You're right. Most people here aren't *arguing* at all. They're just saying they don't believe it, and then some mention other studies but don't bother reading the one under discussion. 
t1_dv04zea	0.747200	*	I'm sure there are black farmhands and even black managers.  They'd be the best people to give the land to... But even doing that will cause problems.  And if it works or not it's still wrong.

t1_dup3pff	0.739900	*	Wow, you are so off base. Whats wrong with learning from other countries and applying what works best?  How many school shootings  were there in Denmark over the last 5 or 10 years? 
t1_dv4diy0	0.073600	*	Why do you think Khodorkovsky went to jail? Also Berezovsky vs Abramovich didn't end well.  But these are relatively peaceful. Not like shit from our 90s.

t1_dv4w4ob	0.026600	*	Exactly. I do believe that no political administration is without its scandal, but this seems so much more prevalent than ever before. Maybe its the coverage? 
t1_dunq25k	0.598400	*	Completely agree. Exclusivity even if it appears to include a collective group always creates some sort of separation.
t1_dud6xn1	0.440400	*	It probably would have read a bit better as ihatecrime2

t1_duq6uef	-0.624900	*	In the book of Acts, in the Bible, the jews do a bit more than look at Paul funny. They try to kill him....several times. But that is how jealousy manifests itself with them.

t1_duvxm73	0.510600	*	Yep, it's Pareto distribution in action. Unfortunately in this case, the 20% that want to take action about this could never begin to get through to the 80% that could care less.

t1_dv3hbvh	0.622700	*	Maybe you should move to the US and become a citizen so you can engage in what you're obsessing over. You're entitled to your opinion, but you have to accept that its just pointless noise.

t1_dua94z7	-0.820600	*	I'm not sure if you're agreeing with him by way of a facetious argument, or if you just managed to shoot yourself in the foot with the attempted of sardonic criticism because I see no counter points. 
t1_dudwpo6	-0.706300	*	Orangutans aren't  pets so your analogy fails from the start. A better analogy would be if you offered Americans 2000 dollars to kill deer.

t1_duk6mk4	-0.051600	*	-- George McGovern, 1972.   *Edit* What? No. Far be it from me to compare Trump to Nixon. Absolutely perish the thought. Nixon was smart enough to hire assassins and try to hide his corruption.

t1_duiub0m	0.361200	*	Where is it .002?  I know one in Australia was constructed in recent years that has a cost of something like .009.  Even then that's not factoring in all the setup costs and environmental impacts.
t1_dunqrc4	-0.526700	*	Yeah, but that exploitation is supposed to drive you to reach the next level. I'm not saying it's right or wrong, but that's the intent.

t1_due8ig4	0.000000	*	Aztec pictographic writing and Zapotec glyphic writing are not that similar. Aztec writing probably stemmed from Toltec writing which may have stemmed from Teotihuacan writing
t1_duypbtj	0.000000	*	They are relatively uncustomary when correlated with their abbreviated alternatives.  I peruse monographs oftentimes, but notwithstanding my erudition I still incline to unornamented parlance.
t1_dun6a5u	0.838100	*	The french government can help refugees, but it should first help french citizens, then help refugees.

t1_dueamo0	-0.493900	*	On the flip side, the opposite also occasionally happens.  Some countries will violate their own laws to extradite someone.  Or America will extraordinary rendition someone.

t1_duehkiw	0.000000	*	The auto industry wouldn't be embracing all-electric if it weren't for Tesla forcing them to.  Rockets can't run on electricity.  That doesn't mean we shouldn't explore space.
t1_dudkldi	0.318200	*	 I think you are right. Probably a fresh virtual machine file would be more convenient.        What info can be gleaned from your hardware using browser canvas?
t1_dulpx06	-0.690800	*	Yeah. We said he was a threat to democracy. We didn't say that was a bad thing.

t1_duy6pun	-0.423400	*	Pretty standard form of racism. Doesn't like white people and is happy when bad things happen to them because they're white.
t1_dunu6fe	-0.421500	*	Yeah well, maybe we should aim for a more empathic conversation with these people rather than calling them dumb. They're never gonna walk this down if we mock them in the process. 
t1_dupk8l6	0.226300	*	Let me be clear. A budget surplus is better than a deficit, but neither are the goal of a government budget.
t1_dujnxdv	0.000000	*	You're right, it's not genius. It's would-be-genius, if he had any idea what he's doing or why it works.

t1_dugtksx	-0.814400	*	Russians aren't by default terrible. The government of Russia is doing some pretty terrible things, but it's kind of racist to attack Russians in general.

t1_dulaowy	0.634600	*	I wasn't arguing that this is the correct path, only that the issue exists. However, I would also say that since the US has the second largest Jewish population, they will definitely have a say.

t1_dv08xxg	-0.690800	*	Feels like the whole Africa is on this trend, all sorts of genocide happening and stealing of children for horrible purposes. What they do to homosexuals is literally medieval. 
t1_dv08xxo	0.493900	*	This happened to a friend of mine who spent 6 months working in SA. He said theyre 10 generations away from figuring anything out.

t1_dudubrd	-0.795800	*	Poetic, but with current tech we are more likely to survive than go extinct I think. In absolutely worst case scenario we will build self contained domes or underground vaults.
t1_dunb603	0.000000	*	I don't think you watched the listening session yesterday. This was brought up by one of the parents from the Florida school as a suggestion and he outlines the specifics.

t1_duozamr	0.839900	*	To be fair, the far right in Europe are pretty left wing when it comes to Economics. Marine le Pen found the most agreement with Melenchon's economic plans rather than Fillon's or Macron's. 
t1_dufyxoj	-0.016400	*	Good summary, I would like to clarify that CFIT is a leading cause of accidents in aviation overall, not commercial aviation, which is what most folks will worry about.

t1_duie9d4	-0.401900	*	I'm going to go out on a limb and say that the scientists in charge of all of this have considered these things, and that is why the margin for error is larger the further back we go.

t1_duc3en2	0.570900	*	Well yes, you are missing the most important part.  Actually putting the correct dose into the syringe.   
t1_duzwluq	0.646000	*	Exactly.  Oh, crap, we got caught red-handed. Let's do something good because it's the right thing to do and not because we want to use it as leverage for freedom.

t1_duro1yj	0.846200	*	I believe he is involved but is deliberately being left out of the reports until a strong case can be built, that way, the individual being investigated feels safer than they are.

t1_due4ap4	-0.510600	*	It's literally Aleve that you can buy over the counter and and Nexium  which you can also buy over the counter combined in a pill.  It's not a drug that can be abused at all.

t1_duwu9au	0.000000	*	Chinese children?
t1_dv4lepc	0.458100	*	What? If a weapon accepts a magazine, the amount of ammo is determined by the magazine, not the gun. Did you mean, the magazine size is limited?
t1_duhnmvl	-0.526700	*	Aye, we're either out getting smashed on Buckfast and Tennent's or lying comatose somewhere. Usually with a demolished munchie box to keep the weight on.
t1_dv4p4xu	0.440400	*	> the good of the country   *oil companies
t1_dv0qjdg	0.401900	*	Didn't you divide relatively clearly into red and blue states?
t1_dv1hhsg	-0.401900	*	Is it a education problem or just a social one? 
t1_duosclr	0.670500	*	Pretty sure a doctor would know the difference between your and you're.
t1_dv25wnk	-0.433600	*	It's not really a loophole. It's a restricted licence. 
t1_dv2nile	-0.226300	*	Europeans also forget we have 350 million citizens.  Raw numbers we still produce the most scientist, etc.  
t1_duft9c8	0.000000	*	Is there a list of airports where they have to do a controlled flight into terrain when landing? 
t1_duiw8vj	-0.296000	*	Just say No Homo  /s

t1_dv1szy5	-0.846500	*	Sorry, but I don't think his supporters give a shit if we rebuild that particular island...
t1_duhz5i9	-0.177900	*	>  (3/4 of who are happy with the arrangement)  Get fucked mate this is a blatant lie. You work for DWP? 
t1_dure7hl	0.296000	*	ok.
t1_dv0hx5j	0.000000	*	That's complete BS.   The US is the first country to have such an inclusive democracy that even other countries can access the voting machines.
t1_dumrh40	-0.458800	*	You'd think your handlers would have educated you on the failures of the US education system. 
t1_durij8p	0.000000	*	Which is why it wasn't referenced as such. The assumption was that it happens more frequently in *non-western* countries.
t1_duy78y9	-0.401900	*	Do you think that the drought and inability to obtain loans for the farms contributed?
t1_dukjwl6	0.337300	*	Heck, you are telling us how to dance also.  Also, I prefer a quick foxtrot, not this lazy waltz that you are using to meander around the situation.
t1_duco7zt	0.458800	*	I'm glad you caught that. English spelling is not American spelling.
t1_due7522	-0.717500	*	My initial comment was tongue in cheek, I wasn't really being defensive.  The way we bring those companies into our country is unethical, I agree, but it's unethical from the corporations sides too. 
t1_duw65e9	0.399100	*	And not having kids. I hate that most people who rave about climate change never once stop to think how the kids they have and their offspring will exhaust even more resources on the planet.
t1_dupy4ag	0.226300	*	> frickin inelastic cigarette- market  I hope you are being sarcastic.
t1_dud21wk	0.750600	*	Haha congrats.  When I retire, i'll probably be the creepy guy at the beach trying to find gold jewelry.
t1_duoodkh	-0.102700	*	even if a more stringent age limit is imposed, i doubt that it would change the practice/tradition of in-family giving all that much.

t1_dv1y8sn	-0.025800	*	His head is far enough up his own ass he likely thinks he's going to take the rust belt again. Because apparently winning by a fraction of a percent means it's his forever.

t1_duxu7r1	0.000000	*	Just bc they are minorities, that doesnt mean they are not part of the country. 
t1_dusgsgn	0.648600	*	I don't think it brought any change, but it did sorta kick the conversation about wealth inequality into the mainstream.

t1_dumv897	0.466000	*	Who did you answer?  Did I say departments are buying guns now?  What?    There are multiple views on how to arm teachers and others. Not just the one you like. 
t1_dusjipm	-0.051600	*	I hear in the US you can buy guns anywhere and there is no universal healthcare with no go zones with confederate flags all over. Pass. Enjoy all your meth though.
t1_duxg5ox	0.000000	*	They wouldn't be able to get visas to get to you.
t1_dux663f	0.526700	*	To add to this Palestinians with Israeli citizenship get equal rights to every other Israeli. Yet how many Jews can go to WB and gain citizenship?
t1_dux6ozp	0.421500	*	Being true for 1 specific empire doesn't make it accurate.
t1_dv269zu	-0.340000	*	Yes, it does. Any person who wants to Tweet graphic violence in France should use those in order to comply with local laws. 
t1_duqxa2x	0.000000	*	The West still intervened in Sierra Leone and Liberia
t1_dv3e9vz	0.659000	*	Point is we're all focused on Russia because Hillary had a document from a UK spy packaged for the FBI. Seems more like she's making a puff of smoke to reduce the focus from her

t1_dutpdbw	-0.462400	*	I don't like the system where they are encouraging people to leave them anywhere. I am appalled the council allowed it. Get docking stations like they have in Brisbane or get rid of the bikes.

t1_duf58kz	-0.453000	*	What are you talking about? I'm not saying the roo shouldn't have broke the guys jaw, I'm saying there is no wrong or right here, it's just part of rural australian life. 
t1_duxka6x	0.206200	*	I don't accept yours, you'd need an intellect in the first place.
t1_dv1lqt8	-0.420100	*	It was probably just a decommissioned or training device.  I highly doubt a live warhead was in that launcher.

t1_ducsp4w	0.000000	*	in this indictment
t1_dupr1lw	0.822500	*	To be fair we are in our infancy compared to European countries.   That said it'd sure be nice to learn from history instead of creating more of it. 
t1_duy12f9	-0.440400	*	This would be a akward law in britain when all ccf weapons are bolt/semi automatic. Tho then again they are technically on lees from the army for kids at schools.
t1_duencea	0.670500	*	People get executed for distribution of movies and stuff from outside NK. I'm pretty sure people know the difference in quality content and NK stuff.

t1_dv4dicp	0.000000	*	Then why don't competitors come in with higher speeds if that's what everyone wants? Is something prohibiting competition?
t1_dv1pcn7	0.000000	*	The Australian equivalent of the FDA is the TGA and FSANZ. We also have the ASB who deal with false/inappropriate advertising, and the TIO who deal with shady ISPs.

t1_dunzdc1	0.165500	*	It's the exact opposite, though.  They supported everyone BUT one person (Hillary Clinton).
t1_duptmtq	0.920000	*	I'm thinking more like the deal with Hannibal Lecter. He was told if he played nice he gets a nice view and occasional nature walks. Things he immensely enjoys. 
t1_duyduza	0.555000	*	Well the Trump's and the Putins can just build domes!  Climate controlled domes with all the comforts of home!   You on the other hand, might be fucked

t1_duwp535	-0.200600	*	Very ironic considering taxes on doctors are about 50% (combined fed and provincial) here where as US doctors aren't even close to a tenth of this...  
t1_duic2ur	0.000000	*	What are they taking singular or something
t1_duppfnt	0.475400	*	just as a comparison. If Seattle would be german it'd be the city with the most sunny hours a year

t1_dv6h5gi	-0.731100	*	China actually profits massively off of multinational cooperation. Xi is a dictator, Ill cede that, but China isnt some evil empire looking to tear down the west.

t1_duuof9n	0.591200	*	I see. So theyre valuable, but saying just the one shark generates millions of dollars is definite hyperbole.

t1_dusxaqc	-0.916900	*	The problem is the replacement of the installed emperor.  Always comes to violence.  A refusal to have periodic changes of leadership leads to growing resentment that fosters violent outlashing.

t1_dud0v33	0.361200	*	I also work in social media and agree with what you said. These accounts had zero influence on the election.

t1_dullcyu	-0.308900	*	Who said it couldn't be hilarious to watch your own demise
t1_dv3ul6l	0.340000	*	Funny how the typical user who posts in r/T_D can be found posting in other subs, like in this example, yet you still accuse them of hiding in their echo chamber. It really doesn't make any sense.
t1_dutbguc	0.640800	*	OK cool. As long as he isn't tied up in a cabin somewhere. (Har har)
t1_dukb0pe	0.000000	*	The UK wants border control. That's it.

t1_duec41s	-0.609400	*	yeah this world is just so damn beautiful.   hell, someone could force me to only vacation in Utah for the rest of my life and I'd just be like 60 years of zion national park? sign me the fuck up

t1_durk559	-0.656400	*	What about all the weapons we can't have like explosives? Chemical or biological? Scalia altered the right to bear arms to mean something a bit different. IIRC.

t1_dv39276	-0.851900	*	For a 'progressive' sub, the only posts that get more than 2 comments are ones bashing Clinton. Anything else, even Bernie's own goddamn message is ignored and drowned out by the 'buttery males' club.

t1_dusvpn1	0.361200	*	Thank you 
t1_dv3ceqj	0.179600	*	I dont know if anything can get more ironic than a post like this receiving gold.  I wonder if the person who paid for the gold realizes the money goes to Reddit.

t1_dv1vqjm	0.476700	*	I always thought bound tariffs were at 30% but brazil taxes parcel imports at 60% cif value. 
t1_dul43l3	-0.289600	*	Alternative solution to the same problem, wear a condom. I'm sure some would be inclined to say that it won't guarantee safety, to which I'll say neither does not having any voluntary sex at all.

t1_dups7kx	0.827100	*	Yeah lmao.  Go into that house and confiscate their guns.  It's a bold strategy, let's see how that works out for them.

t1_dv2k0fc	-0.019100	*	Doesn't matter, none of them know what plurality means.
t1_due1f82	0.493900	*	Interesting. Out of curiousity, is it 50% ownership by a citizen or by any legal person?
t1_durxp7h	-0.831600	*	It's quality is degrading as of late. Example: this article, one single source, defector which is traditionally been an biased source against NK regime.

t1_duph5sf	0.502300	*	Man, I'm Argentinean and didn't know this. I knew we had drugs, but thought it was like everywhere else.   Also... ^where ^^can ^^^i ^^^^get ^^^^^lsd
t1_dut585e	0.273200	*	Uh, they have the internet. English is the official language of the internet, and they are pretty likely to know it.  Your statement applies to the older generation, but not this current one.

t1_dukro2i	0.421500	*	Free my ass. Like when we bailed out the auto industry and the banking industry? To paraphrase MLK, in America we have socialism for the rich and rugged individualism for the poor.

t1_durgwjr	-0.883400	*	What the fuck are you talking about? These are the only people left alive who had a nuclear bomb dropped on them. Ignoring them because of other bad things is censorship. 
t1_duoso9z	-0.624900	*	Yeah, that's a stupid assumption. When they get tired of currupt politicians they may revolt?
t1_dur6aik	-0.743000	*	You don't even just have to remember. The newest article over there is There is no humanitarian crisis in Venezuela.
t1_dusbp7p	0.258400	*	Im not disagreeing with you, just explaining my understanding of it.

t1_dv3rejb	0.690800	*	Flu shots are given for free because insurance companies deem them to lessen the overall cost. They are monetarily the smartest thing to do

t1_dujmpgs	-0.401900	*	He called it a hoax. Does hoax mean something that might have happened or does hoax mean a humorous or malicious deception?
t1_dunoe9t	-0.365700	*	Like we all don't know that all generalizations are wrong. I'm sorry, I found the one in a million. And the bitch makes maps. Fucking maps. Thanks Magellan.

t1_duparoh	-0.153100	*	No one is implying they don't have civilian employees, but NATO is first and foremost a military organization, i.e. not civilian.

t1_dusnmgx	-0.194200	*	Do right leaning news articles even exist on this topic? If not, you can't blame the bot for not presenting them.    
t1_duk354v	0.361200	*	That's why I'm wary when people like Oprah are hyped for candidates. What about somebody who already spent a few years or more in government and kinda knows what they're doing.
t1_duoh4pt	-0.734600	*	Where even am I?  Criticism of Islam not being downvoted to oblivion?  I thought this was /worldnews :S

t1_duopmsg	-0.571900	*	Chaos is a ladder.
t1_durpjxi	0.296000	*	The thing about food is that you can grow your own. Its easy to enter the market.  Entering energetic market is prohibitively expensive which destroys competition.

t1_due0u40	-0.296000	*	He made one comment that made sense.  The big banks do the same thing as him yet no one in the government is knocking on their door.

t1_dug2wib	0.000000	*	The twisted logic that you're applying?
t1_duptkjj	0.641200	*	germany gives lots of money to greek. Surely this might be an investment to stop a downfall of the eu, but anyway it still is the factor why greek is still in austerity and not bankrupt.

t1_duw09c4	-0.476700	*	This guy fucks.

t1_duzydhg	0.316700	*	Completely agree. I can't believe people are shitting on Mandela here considering his impact on the Truth and Reconciliation process. This thread is just filled with people on both extremes.

t1_dufbwlx	0.483000	*	Not long ago before modern dental practices it was much more common to lose teeth. Wisdom teeth would come in an help replace or snug up gaps.

t1_dun5his	-0.931300	*	This shit has been going on since the Cold War, at least. An argument could be made for it stemming from before the Civil War.
t1_duzj3m8	-0.296000	*	I wasnt comparing the situations. Just saying that if you dont think there can be girls that are dying to die for their countries, youve clearly never been to palestine. 
t1_duoznuh	-0.202300	*	Except it did no damage. In Russia people expect higher ups to be rich of their power. By our logic, who wouldn't?

t1_dupkrv8	-0.240600	*	Why be in favor of using debt that future generations have to pay for? Why not just bite the bullet and pay for it yourself?

t1_dv2w2ob	-0.296000	*	Depends if penguin society follows the no borders philosophy.
t1_duv7aoa	-0.102700	*	That's because the UK at least tries to pretend they aren't authoritarian and censoring their populace.
t1_dufj1m1	0.000000	*	Shhhhh
t1_dulq8yg	-0.542300	*	How the fuck is this getting downvoted? Your asking for evidence and the OP hasn't provided any even his article goes against his talking points.

t1_ducopni	-0.306300	*	We have to hold others accountable though.  We can't possibly be responsible for our own actions, not when there is clearly somebody else to blame for them!   I need confirmation for my biases!   /s
t1_dv16hys	-0.017000	*	But a picture is worth a 1000 words. Plus they do not allow you to type 1000 words in twitter.  In a serious note, this is absurd.

t1_duoe3w5	-0.247700	*	And wonder why the only state/province without tons of debt is the Kremlin one? Such a shame. 
t1_dvc6x0o	0.526700	*	I don't know but they have nuclear capable submarines that could be anywhere, including near Alaska I suppose.
t1_dv048mf	-0.340000	*	> Honestly I don't know the most about South Africa's situation, but this **seems** like egregious racism and the start of a very slippery slope.  Seems? 
t1_dugjcr6	0.458800	*	Out of interest, whose numbers do you use?
t1_duw0j96	-0.476700	*	Basically the same here but a bit colder. We had a frost warning on Friday night and I had to bring my plants in.

t1_dun7dqv	-0.296000	*	Uh, no that's not what OP was referring to. THE UKIP people obviously worried/talked more about how the flood of refugees is replacing the people there, and the accompanying culture.

t1_dudpwjn	0.670500	*	The Cons are largely powered by oil.  The Liberals have been creating a competition free environment for decades.
t1_dv5mop4	-0.296000	*	No, I am British. It's an actual fact that most UN solders are from Pakistan, Bangladesh + India.   >if you're another Indian troll   you'll do what exactly?

t1_dujf86w	-0.345900	*	Yes, The Waqf controls what people can do in the Temple Mount (Al Aqsa). Jews are forbidden for praying there. Yet, these kids are allowed to play soccer and shit.   They don't care about that. 
t1_duv2kbk	-0.458500	*	>In what kind of futuristic Communist Utopia do you live?  Canada, last air Canada flight I was on had usb ports you could charge a phone on but not powerful enough for a tablet

t1_dv23nfd	0.585900	*	Wow. Really? 
t1_duq5cql	-0.612400	*	Yes. The TL;DR is that they got charged with tax evasion and failing to register as foreign lobbyists (both occurring before Trump hired them), and then (after Trump hired them) lied about it.
t1_duta81e	-0.897800	*	I don't know, comparing him to Putin isn't great. Putin has stolen hundred of billions from his own citizens, and murdered many.

t1_duj2vnd	-0.636900	*	>Do the Russian people still live in a democracy though?  No. When candidates that can defeat the current president are arbitrarily jailed/censored/killed, democracy is not a thing anymore.
t1_dv0v3da	0.421500	*	Except that, again, the EFSA (and every other scientific and regulatory safety body) concluded the exact opposite to be the case.
t1_dut0arj	0.296000	*	Yeah and they also eat too much rice. /s. But could you elaborate?

t1_duyki59	-0.569500	*	Can i get a source on Obama? I don't think Obama pardoned any bankers for their role in the financial crisis. I see some bank fraud pardons, but that's not it. 
t1_dui6e35	0.329100	*	You think you've inherited a worse society than what the people in 40's/50's inherited?  Regardless you just gotta get on with life. I voted to remain, but I accept the vote and we'll move forward

t1_dusun89	-0.401900	*	Are you one of the morons who believed Mexico was actually going to pay for it?
t1_dv3bhsu	0.420100	*	As an outsider, I completely agree with everything you said. 
t1_dv6k7cy	0.202300	*	You'll need to reform your electoral system too. The FPP system naturally gives rise to a two-party choice because there are no prizes for coming third.
t1_duwi67l	-0.796400	*	Fuck that shit, took me 3 attempts to pass it
t1_duoanye	-0.381800	*	Thats beyond horrible, how are people okay with it?

t1_dv003aa	0.767900	*	To be fair if you compare Cuba to other Caribbean countries with long histories of US backed dictators it's actually doing really well. $22k PPP GDP per capita isn't bad for an island nation. 
t1_duhxneq	-0.641400	*	Yeah you're right, in the US neither party cares about the deficit
t1_dv0vlwy	0.440400	*	Oh, good grief....
t1_duhj29u	0.458800	*	It's leverage, he testifies against Manafucked, who in turn faces a long time in jail and is motivated to flip on Trump. It's dominos. They may not even need them at this point though. 
t1_duzcb3p	-0.038700	*	Normally I'd say state department, but in the past we've had ex-presidents and famous people successfully negotiate the release of prisoners.

t1_duxehmk	0.840200	*	Yeeaahhh... Maybe if it was Poland or Amsterdam he was gushing about, but it wasn't. It's The Philippines and Duterte he praises. The implication is clear

t1_duq93oy	0.361200	*	To tag onto your question: If true, I wonder if the NRA is being used to launder Russian money. Maybe launder is not correct and it falls under the purview of lobbying.
t1_dur6y94	0.401900	*	Party of personal responsibility right
t1_dw2s8p6	0.886000	*	I've gotten over it.  Restoring my foreskin has helped a lot, along with donating to Intact America, and helping save babies from the same mutilation I experienced.  :)

t1_dubgjt3	0.000000	*	I think that is different from a State acting with morals. It has to deal with the morals of it's citizens, but the State itself does not have any.
t1_dugclh1	0.000000	*	Spot. On.
t1_dueh6dl	0.361200	*	Just like all those Russians vacationing in Crimea.
t1_dv1iwzd	-0.353200	*	I'm not sure. Atp28 was hacked by the Dutch for like a year before it came out. The Dutch even had the security cams hacked

t1_dus6mgq	-0.857700	*	But I mean why didnt they just move? Do they just want to die? They had plenary of warning that Katrina was coming.... whoops wrong thread.
t1_duf2p0y	-0.624900	*	As a fellow northerner I agree, the home counties are just a relentless game of croquet and tennis with twice daily Princess Die mourning and a salute to the Iron Lady.

t1_dua56fl	0.700300	*	My god you are pretentious. I never said the US was perfect. Far from it. I'm just saying it didn't deserve your overly dramatic title. 
t1_dut9beu	0.400300	*	To bad! Thanks though :)
t1_dutzsno	0.680800	*	As I said, maybe in a Trump supporter's eye that's an effective wall. Thank you for proving my point.  
t1_duj77cz	0.458800	*	eh compare to majority of the world your pricing is decent.  you are nowhere near Singapore level or Israel level honestly.
t1_duvzfhi	-0.817600	*	Right-wing coke dealer is altogether different. It's a human tragedy. Shame on you for even mentioning it. Left-wing coke dealer though is just degeneracy.
t1_dubwb8p	0.440400	*	They could also take a few courses to be real painters for houses etc and earn a good amount of money. If they wanted to.
t1_dulsnhi	-0.284600	*	It works for corporations, so why not boats or even cars? Of course I'll be pissed that my Subaru writes in Bernie Sanders in 2020 while I'm voting for a Libertarian, but that's the brakes.

t1_durjtfq	-0.659700	*	the sale of Telstra was actually a good thing as far as internet speeds go.  While Telstra was still a public company it was horrendous, after the sale things were merely bad.

t1_dugxvju	0.599400	*	What a beautiful simile.
t1_duyvov9	-0.025800	*	His followers already believe this. Best case scenario they stay home and stop voting because they feel the system is 'rigged' and they become irrelevant to democracy until they die of old age. 
t1_dv4l0j7	0.421500	*	True dat. I'd take emissions that plants can eat over acid rain generation, though.
t1_dubqkot	0.000000	*	If anyone from monsanto is out there now, I'll sell you my two year old account for a quick hundred. Actually, how much do you think these old accounts go for?

t1_dub2rec	0.577000	*	Exactly, it seems pretty easy to ship guns back and forth over the borders, so if you cut the supply on one side it will start running from the other.

t1_dunwcv6	0.000000	*	Actually most places in my area use paper cups for all sizes, even large. There's a movie theater by the highway that serves large sodas that are at *least* a litre but they're still paper.
t1_dud3ad0	0.000000	*	Eh I didnt have an epidural either time and both doctors still made me give birth laying flat on my back. Doctors are going to revert to what they know
t1_duj2xbv	-0.757900	*	No worries. In my experience it's better to stay off reddit when having problems in real life because more often than not it only exacerbates the problem.

t1_dug9ulb	0.401900	*	Sorry, obscure Under Siege reference.  That's a good effort. You speak like it's past tense. Did you keep it up after becoming a civilian?
t1_duov25u	0.200600	*	Why would I?   Now that he is detained and waiting for trial, he probably will get more care from his government than his whole life had gotten.

t1_dujjsm9	-0.306900	*	It actually is. Saying trump is not a liar would be fake news. Balanced news doesnt mean using fake news but using different sources of different political sides.

t1_duc0uso	-0.726900	*	I can see Turkey forcing the US military bases out of Turkey.  The US has overstepped by illegally setting up bases in Syria, supporting terrorists and bullying Turkey in the region.
t1_duczlqe	0.318200	*	Can confirm shills were a huge thing during the election.   /pol/ was flooded with shareblue and CTR shills. 
t1_duwlmlx	0.051600	*	Nobody forced the Irish to be in EU. And Brexit just happen. They are welcome to join UK if they think being alone is better...

t1_duocnzt	-0.287800	*	Here is the problem. Each side is very good at picking out the other side's propaganda, but not so good at figuring out when they're being fed bullshit that doesn't run contrary to their own beliefs.

t1_dui4ayl	-0.817600	*	Notice how I mentioned two concrete things that verifiably happened, while youve fallen back on gossip, speculation, victim blaming, and unverifiable vagaries. 
t1_dur359l	0.946800	*	Yeah definitely but I can't imagine there are a significant enough number of them to not just be  destroyed by the immune system if only like 0.01% are immune.
t1_dur85gu	0.296000	*	So, you somehow know the exact details of what information she's passing along? I don't either, but ya gotta admit, everything - EVERYTHING - about the trump administration is hinky.
t1_duie090	0.664300	*	I don't disagree.   Your problem is that you have to convince everyone else that they need to reduce your tax load. (Because they 'need' something.)
t1_duulfd0	0.700300	*	China Uncensored on YouTube is pretty amusing with its telling of CCP politics:  https://www.youtube.com/user/NTDChinaUncensored/videos
t1_duxr5b1	-0.569300	*	How are people considered poor in fucking America?   On topic, do you think forcing a woman to wear something she doesn't want to wear in public is a form of oppression? 
t1_dv25mcs	0.000000	*	You guessed correctly about the PhD from Harvard.  Scroll half way down and find Tyler Goodspeed  Link: Council of Economic Advisors to the president. https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/staff/
t1_dur6pr9	-0.176100	*	You'd be surprised how few people actually want Hillary to be president. Most dislike both her and Trump.

t1_durakih	0.102700	*	And here we see a problem with this debate: inability to talk in good faith.  Someone makes a typo on the type of gun used, and it gets a response like this.

t1_duvxuhx	0.635100	*	And let the Rich run everything!!? Politics is about Who gets What, When and How. Remember that when you kick your politicians down. 
t1_duu17xm	0.000000	*	It was Rand McNally
t1_dul08hv	0.526700	*	When you are doing the right thing that's called brave.
t1_duvrz10	-0.734600	*	Or a kid who wanted revenge against a school that he felt did him wrong. Wow, it's almost like there are a ton of reasons to murder people that don't involve politics. 
t1_dueix23	-0.318200	*	>one of the core fucking reasons for NATO was preventing Germany from ever becoming a relevant world power again.  No it wasn't... It was a political alliance against the Soviet Union
t1_dv2n9xp	0.340000	*	> My approach, I just ended up turning every country I played into Canada.  Until you can turn it into Norway you haven't completed the game.

t1_dur3sfi	-0.594900	*	That's why famine is so awful.  Eventually, people will ingest whatever they can metabolize according to physics.
t1_duc8nlo	-0.921700	*	He wasnt trying to help the general people. He did it for his gang members because sick gang members tend to get pissed off at their boss for bad work conditions. And they are a violent bunch. 
t1_duvcqym	0.000000	*	Two separate sources and you still are in denial. Un-fucking-believable.
t1_dv01g84	-0.790600	*	I can get behind saying it could get that bad if things don't change, but saying this one action is as bad as apartheid is just flat out untrue.

t1_duaa4hy	0.273200	*	They could of had a plan before they gave us the option to leave.  I don't think 1 vote with such a tight margin is enough to push such a huge task.
t1_durtxuj	-0.226300	*	Alcohol is still no challenge for anyone under 21 to get..
t1_dv3xuzv	-0.273200	*	No, he hated clinton and wanted her to lose. That's why he had trolls even backing Bernie. Trump winning was a bonus.
t1_dv5bobk	-0.726900	*	It's hard to take anything he says seriously.  So many people don't know the difference between lose and loose it's incredible.

t1_duhwrmy	0.735100	*	Ha, amazing perspective.
t1_dv2rzij	-0.476700	*	Just poor Barron...
t1_dufas6e	-0.727400	*	I don't agree with this. I'm sure the people who work there lean left, but I really don't think their coverage is actually biased as in misleading or anything. 
t1_duhhk4g	-0.174200	*	You've got to let him try though! He shows how devout a Christian is by trying to completely disrespect another religion, shows how much he values Jesus' teachings.
t1_duvn2jh	-0.025800	*	well i don't know of any ballot or voter manipulation (except the common stuff in every us election) ... so what ya mean? 
t1_dudn8y6	-0.790200	*	But this kind of fake news trolling has been major force in world politics over the last few years.  This is the bleeding edge of the culture wars.

t1_dubusfr	0.296000	*	kek, Seth Rich.  And Jews and stuff.... when are you going to shoot up a school?
t1_dudawew	-0.796400	*	Mentally retarded is a stretch. Willfully ignorant and morally confused is much more accurate.
t1_dv5lq7i	-0.440400	*	As a non American it saddens me to see some Americans so completely oblivious at the international sentiment right now.

t1_dudkc5e	-0.128000	*	My bad :)

t1_dupms7z	0.502300	*	Not too much about it's lifecycle, but it sounds like it floats around eating bacteria in ponds.  It's more common in murky/disturbed water and factories because of readily available food.
t1_dut27zd	0.381800	*	Its nit because of your thnicity its because you are sending American dollars out the door. Your welcome to just not do it then you wont pay.
