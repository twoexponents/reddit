t1_dtg5gdm	-0.721900	*	They have substantial control as is, UK governments just have a bad habit of not limiting immigration, which they are allowed to do to a considerable extent, and blaming the EU for it.

t1_dte74c9	0.273200	*	 That is the crux of it though. His legitimacy is based on the economy and the economy in Russia is not doing well. 
t1_dt76ac4	0.411800	*	Ah, there's one part of this discussion you have failed to understand. I think you are a bad actor and will simply dismiss anything I provide.

t1_dswn5a5	0.748700	*	I was a Trump supporter but you cannot say that Hillary won the primary fairly. I don't care what your politics are but it was absolute corruption. Everyone who followed the election knew it.
t1_dt13zu5	0.796400	*	More like the US takes care of most of Germanys defense, and the EU in general. Which is why they do not need to care. NATO, look it up.

t1_dth2sob	0.493900	*	Because voters do care about it which means anyone who has copies of the tape has blackmail material they can use to coerce the POTUS.  That's something people who care about America are bothered by.
t1_dttnwck	0.169500	*	But first, we'll wait ten episodes before we can see the planet's final form.

t1_dtap656	-0.773800	*	Any kind of verbal abuse they get is earned. They chose to take money for dicking over and dehumanizing their own fellow citizens.

t1_dss487o	0.670500	*	Still with the absolute conclusions, eh?   Using IQ to measure the complex nuance of human intelligence is like using a stick to measure the depth of the ocean.

t1_dsk5wfo	-0.525600	*	The open borders people like you advocate doesn't help me.
t1_dsz5oqz	-0.128000	*	That's right.  If you take some personal responsibility you can get world class healthcare here.  If you expect someone else to do everything for you then this is not the place to be.

t1_dt04j0w	-0.411800	*	The point is that the article is written about the opinions of a PI, hired by the family who didn't believe it was a murder suicide. The family basically paid to get what they wanted to hear.

t1_dttv1qu	-0.664100	*	Where were the Nazi death camps physically located?  Who controls that land now?  What is the name of the country?  Why would we go back to 1940's era country markings just for specific sites?

t1_dt84hyy	-0.566100	*	That requires a single politician openly discussing the de-funding of Israel. That's political suicide. Ron Paul talked about it, after he retired.

t1_dt9yrcg	-0.354400	*	In my opinion yes. Sure people will get their feelings hurt, its not a perfect world, but when you make insults illegal you create a subjective application of the law as to what constitutes an insult
t1_dsrtliu	0.612400	*	Wrong 1%. It'll be the 70 million people around the world with access to fishing/molluscs. So like people living on the tip of New Zealand and fisher folk will survive. 
t1_dtssacp	-0.440400	*	Yes. You might not like Israel, but at least it has a democratically elected government rather than a president for life on the thirteenth year of his five year team.
t1_dt9w0hz	-0.790600	*	Generally (but not always) a degree that isn't art or social science... something that requires you to actually study and learn facts instead of feelings.

t1_dto11lv	-0.338400	*	Actually we could.  The world doesn't need countries to be spending 3.5% of their gdp on defense anymore.  
t1_dt2jn37	-0.153100	*	Not accusations so much as reminders that Catholicism does have ideological issues, evolution just isn't always one of them.

t1_dsny94i	-0.443000	*	That's not why people were upset, but you're a Trump supporter so I'm not surprised the finer details of an issue were lost on you.  Why don't you go have a juice and let the adults talk.

t1_dttgtpy	0.000000	*	So your criticism of Kerry is guilt by association. Pathetic.
t1_dtuidu2	-0.509300	*	I've noticed that. A friend got busted at a red light when a cop jumped out of a bush he was hiding in. They bust people smoking weed more than cellphones from what I hear

t1_dtn3ufe	0.000000	*	this is addressed in the memo. The corroborating information was a yahoo article (A yahoo article) that was planted by Steele. Why is the DOJ relying on a yahoo article?
t1_dtdg56c	0.700300	*	And some people want to ally with such a leadership. The logic there is difficult to comprehend. Anyone care to enlighten us?
t1_dskagzh	0.000000	*	Unfortunately other countries are full of barbarians that don't pay attention to well written signs.
t1_dsfdag9	0.910900	*	They must understand how unrealistic that is though right? Peaceful reunification that doesn't preserve the Kim regime is a fantasy.
t1_dsvzlau	0.000000	*	Well, to be fair they were banned from the last Olympics too, just the committee took more money and let them back in. They are so corrupt. 
t1_dt5w6q0	0.571900	*	This is an attack by a foreign country who seek to undermine democracy. It crosses party lines.
t1_dswkqu9	0.770700	*	Let's see how that argument looks if you replace it with something else.  people against gun violence are perfectly free to not commit gun violence, it is that simple
t1_dtajpn1	-0.778300	*	That is what a SJW is,  and obnoxious person coopting social justice terminology to rationalize their own repugnant behaviour.

t1_dt2jv5p	0.599400	*	It could be god, or it could be a tiny pink hippo who caused the big bang. We have just as much evidence for either.

t1_dtums2b	0.000000	*	Yup.  Space X has now achieved what only NASA and the Soviets managed-- the booster landing was just extra credit.
t1_dsd6s55	-0.895500	*	Sure some things are. But then again. I bet alot of people thought that until they were holding their intestines spilling out of a hole in their stomach. And the house of saud still stands. 
t1_dt4uy4c	0.876500	*	I didn't think Democrats were that right wing.   Cus Tories are fairly high up there.
t1_dt2qq42	0.510600	*	God also gave us the capacity for rational thought. Let there be light... is a metaphor. Those who choose to think otherwise are not using that capacity as well as they should.

t1_dstm2jg	-0.318200	*	No, I just stick to Infowars and FOX and the Trump Twitter feed, like a good Republican.  Sorry, looks like you might prefer Stormfront.
t1_dsl2b7b	-0.296000	*	> why would posting there invalidate a statement not relating to a post from there?  If that's your opinion, it makes your lying about  your history all the more bizarre.
t1_dswf7d4	0.739700	*	Only because Trump demanded they pick up more of the bill for their own defense. I know Europe hates Trump, but you guys may end up thanking him when you need to defend yourselves...
t1_dt1qykn	-0.976600	*	Xi's corruption crusade seems to be more about consolidating his power than actually going after corruption. 
t1_dt5hksk	-0.842400	*	How about giving some examples of policies that you supported, republicans pushed, and democrats fought against?

t1_dttb3y7	-0.766300	*	Yeah, that's not what this spat is over though. To say that no Poles at all assisted in the genocide is equally mad. 
t1_dsko2dm	0.843800	*	Did Boris Johnson ridicule Obama when he was mayor? They have a similar disparity in political views. It's called class.
t1_dswu257	-0.902200	*	I think the whole protecting the unborn part is more central to pro-lifers.
t1_dsmaatm	0.165500	*	Huh, well that's what came off my Tromsxf8 google search. It still shows underground roundabouts in Norway which I think was the point of the post, not exactly where they are.
t1_dtktpmw	0.825800	*	Every meat consumer reading this thread knows that now.   Do you think they're going to make any changes to their diet after reading this?
t1_dtb0pvl	0.421500	*	So, Google tells me [Ivan Klimov may be your man](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6h1BAq_fcXI) (  for exotic foreign googling). Their dancing is sorta meh, though.

t1_dsm9uxy	0.747000	*	they also have fun laws where they don't have to put a name on the incorporation papers in some places. So even when they track down who owns what, they still don't know.

t1_dto8qfh	-0.046000	*	It's like when you see a sign on a hiking trail that says, Do not attempt to hug the mountain lions. Some ass wagon tried to win a Darwin Award so they had to make a sign.

t1_dtt3ywp	0.927400	*	The top twenty make 99% of the wealth. So it is almost as if you make all the money you pay all the taxes. Except they still underpay proportionally.

t1_dsin3bt	0.735100	*	It's a little bit of both I think. Our whole history is just an endless chain of self-inflicted harm and external influence. Shitty location for a country of this size.

t1_dtmmrdt	-0.144900	*	Trump also has much more power.  Being as all trade negotations go through the E.U. this doesnt hold much power.  This is more like a state governor giving their opinion.

t1_dsurw23	0.361200	*	This is the same in any country. Some of the biggest visa overstayers in Australia are Brits. I don't expect Australia to ban UK citizens from obtaining visas.
t1_dtsqf9w	0.000000	*	Look at America, that government represents less than half the people
t1_dt1b9sr	0.500700	*	Half of the US Senate is a rotten borough. When many states have the populations of small cities it isn't hard to sway the electorate and not just at election time, but a constant drone of propaganda.

t1_dtoffx4	-0.618700	*	They are not the same and I agree.     But the Confederacy were traitors to the US and they lost, the bullshit 'heritage excuse need not apply.    
t1_dt2j04w	-0.525500	*	When something has gone so wrong, it's hard not to talk about it.  Kinda like Hitler.
t1_dto6oau	0.492700	*	Maple Leave
t1_dsjxy9b	0.000000	*	I mean, he said it in a meeting with law makers, not a press conference. I hate Trump, but this was said behind closed doors, and I imagine large portions of America agree with him.
t1_dtd16ak	-0.403300	*	Perhaps. But care to explain 'fuck the climate' to me? Maybe I'll be less dumb.
t1_dt4dj1u	0.616900	*	Mao, Stalin, Lenin, Pol Pot. Communism is quite literally the objectively larger evil.   Nothing the Nazis did can compare to the Mao regime let alone Cambodias killing fields.

t1_dsj2wmv	0.296000	*	I meant more about the US statement. 
t1_dtfzc7e	0.051600	*	The media doesn't do that because that's not what people want. People chose the facts they want and politics is about who has the flashier presentation. 
t1_dt9oy0o	0.492700	*	people have been trying to map the Trumps to the Bluths, and as it turns out, it looks like Donald is Buster. Just give him grilled cheese.

t1_dtbwfad	-0.402900	*	I dont think T_D was in full swing yet (I mightve just still been innocent) but breaking news on Reddit seemed to die with the pulse nightclub shooting

t1_dt5el8d	-0.169500	*	You could also look at comments by people calling Trump worse than KJU, or supporting the Korean position and calling the U.S. an aggressor.
t1_dso5xw7	0.000000	*	European Parliament
t1_dtf84p4	0.000000	*	When the memo drops, you'll be able to read it yourself.  McCabe ~~stepped down~~ was removed the very day after Christopher Wray read the memo. That's not coincidental.

t1_dsjdskj	0.541100	*	My government isn't my press though, and unlike a certain oompa loompa, my government isn't petty so it's unlikely to get involved.

t1_dslwstc	0.000000	*	I mean, I guess it's a little closer than Chinese or Japanese. Maybe someday you'll get asked if you're Cambodian.
t1_dtpuke5	0.128000	*	Ironically, being a nazi ally made it easier to deal with things as the country wanted to. Japan, not just Chiune Sugihara, refused to follow nazi recommendations for handling Jews.
t1_dtqikel	0.963000	*	but you just said people are unequal. why strife for equality? we already have equality of rights so? what else?
t1_dstr4jv	0.000000	*	Well is made for the purpose that bachh2 described, a neutral flag for both countries. I wouldn't call it lame, I would call it simplistic, and that's not necessarily a bad thing.  But each their own.
t1_dtghghv	-0.401900	*	Then wouldn't that make this a case for the Supreme Court to hear? If we're unsure if this is well within the POTUS power, we can use them to define what the proper course of action is, right?

t1_dtev2pi	-0.943800	*	Honest question: what are you so afraid of? And why do you think women don't have legitimate concerns in society?
t1_dttf048	0.778300	*	They are different.  That's an astounding statement.  Chemotherapy and money aren't the same.  Weird.
t1_dsjhpy3	0.000000	*	I always saw the United States as a cool place (Im from the Netherlands)  But honestly, it really seems like a shitty place to live compared to other western countries.

t1_dsx69nr	0.000000	*	I know that the can do that, I'm just saying that I don't think it's done here in the UK. I've never talked anyone outside the US with a setup like that.
t1_dt9vqtv	-0.226300	*	Someone's been watching too many YouTube cop compilations. The majority of cops are actually great people. 
t1_dtij3eq	-0.510600	*	Kind of an edgy thing to say......are you two related?
t1_dt8uapg	-0.790600	*	It is. Way less guillotining in English history. Couple of Henry VIII's wives did get chopp'd tho which is notable. 
t1_dtlhzik	0.000000	*	No the starlight isn't enough to power it. It's orbit didn't put it fully in the earth's shadow but once every couple years. Eventually one of these eclipses tripped the breaker back.

t1_dsyx59i	0.735100	*	That's exactly the problem. There **isn't** a free market on healthcare in the US. If there was the prices would be as low as in other free market healthcare nations such as in India or Thailand.
t1_dtguvc0	-0.541100	*	The guy I was replying to was trying to imply that UK law is entirely up to the UK and not influenced by the EU..

t1_dtg2c5r	0.000000	*	So it's an entire western culture thing? I'm curious if French/German/Italian etc. Millenials are experiencing the same thing.
t1_dslvltz	0.612400	*	Yeah I dont understand the uproar. I find other peoples ethnicity and culture to be a fascinating part of their life that Im beyond curious about. Its conversation.

t1_dsfrog1	0.273200	*	Is that true or is it just propaganda. Like I know it's shit over there, but how much of it is just lies.
t1_dtkajkd	0.000000	*	Im gonna allow it. Roll it out boys 
t1_dttrf2y	0.793500	*	I live literally 15 minutes from Detroit. I think I might know a little bit more about what's been going on here than someone who gets their news from the internet.

t1_dteet9q	0.212000	*	If Trump keeps pushing with new import taxes the Chinese might stop buying. Recently he announced 50% on washing mashines and 30% on solar modules
t1_dsi5bmc	0.000000	*	There are far more well-educated Chinese in Europe and America. Its kind of like theyre voting with their feet.

t1_dtb5ek6	0.000000	*	It's cheaper to build a new station than it would be to retrofit this up to current standards.  
t1_dsxky5b	-0.310200	*	702 vs domestic spying - different thing.
t1_dskrzsx	0.808900	*	But most importantly, you've got to relax. I'm Mr. Meeseeks! Look at me!

t1_dtnzs2s	-0.877700	*	Funny how the discourse up here in Canada has changed over the past year. It used to be that China shouldn't be trusted and now it's we should make more trade partners.

t1_dswz7l1	0.273200	*	I'd rephrase it like that:  Nothing is philosophic if you **want results**.  If you want to talk about something endlessly, everything is philosophic. 
t1_dtud0b8	0.000000	*	Believe me, most Russian gays don't have time for political shit too. You can ask yourself on their Russian website  http://www.gay.ru/  At the end of the day, they are ordinary Russians too.

t1_dshrd5h	-0.226300	*	Well they saw the results and tampered with governments to eliminate Marxism. A necessary evil that likely helped avoid much larger problems with those systems down the road. 
t1_dta06ko	0.526700	*	It's a principle not just a law.
t1_dtdhmgg	0.557400	*	I don't get why people simply accept what he's doing. Is it a situation similar to North Korea where the most devoted of followers feel like the nation could not survive without him?

t1_dttbtjr	0.000000	*	A higher percentage of Americans (50%) think killing civilians for political purposes is sometimes or always justified than Persians

t1_dthlwdf	0.000000	*	Oh I agree. German prosecuters are in fact still tracking down Nazis. r/worldnews on the other hand was kinda upset about Germany imprisoning that nonagenerian Auschwitz bookkeeper the other day.

t1_dt2cfmm	-0.495600	*	The difference is that in the United States, you're permitted to have different values without being hunted by the state. Maybe it's all well and good in Beijing, but what about Tibet?
t1_dso8p5e	0.000000	*	So true, I'm no Trump supporter, but that whole thing with the two scoops of ice cream was ridiculous. I swear if the guy sneezed without covering his mouth it would be an international headline.

t1_dsuvidv	0.476700	*	To your own family and friends, yes, its easy. We all did little lies here and there when we were kids. Wouldnt you be scared if the police and the press were *involved through?
t1_dska64h	-0.784500	*	Eli5 why is that?
t1_dtlz606	-0.869700	*	The identity politics embraced by many on the Right is the cancer, Trump was the inevitable response to that.   Fix for you.

t1_dt21ixt	0.612400	*	More likely that he couldn't afford to risk any more scandals once he got to the position. He never made his position clear or retracted statements from the letter.
t1_dtax4yp	0.000000	*	Or maybe some people just think she's ugly. Or is that also just being mysogynistic?

t1_dtoclev	-0.401900	*	I'm saying your analogy is flawed.  This was an 'immigrant' / 'outsider' in a white country.  So this racist took his anger out on those outsiders, using skin color as his guide.

t1_dtjf6xj	0.936200	*	But it is still ones right to practice that religion on themselves. The issue here is whether we should force those practices on a child.

t1_dst80eo	0.700300	*	Classic reddit. We are watching a potential monumental event in American politics, one that will shape the Presidency forever, and it took two comments to get a Dumb and Dumber reference. I love it.

t1_dsraw4e	0.000000	*	Maybe they'd preferred the superposition of being in the EU while not being in the EU?  I'd have told them to get inside a box with radioactive poison, and say hello to the cat.

t1_dt5221j	-0.261700	*	A lot of people suddenly loved TPP and state rights as soon as Trump was elected
t1_dssr033	-0.279600	*	Actually, that's not true. I have known plenty of Chinese (primarily girls in their twenties) who were both educated and in healthy financial situations yet still had their VISA applications denied.
t1_dslifuo	0.510600	*	Trump was elected to crush the Washington elite, lower my taxes, improve the economy, dismantle ACA and build a wall, amongst other things.  Hes done most of it.  Sweet narrative though.  
t1_dt2jv5p	0.718400	*	It could be god, or it could be a tiny pink hippo who caused the big bang. We have just as much evidence for either.
t1_dsyiglt	0.000000	*	On principle how is immigration reform relevant to a budget bill?
t1_dt14efk	0.000000	*	And yet anyone can look up the products they buy. Maybe 70 years ago when the only information on a product was the product, but now the only excuse is ignorance and thst can be cured

t1_dsrjkvp	-0.952400	*	I agree. We should expect more from people in California. But my point is that people do awful shit to people everywhere.

t1_dsmmvm6	-0.659700	*	Oh my God, I'm stupid. I honestly expected there to be a conspiracy theory about Clinton running a human trafficking operation that involves lubed up male prostitutes.

t1_dspe38c	-0.762900	*	Depends on the input. The input was faulty. Human had a gut feeling. Algorithms don't have those
t1_dtocvo5	0.421500	*	Enslaving black people is a problem.  The Confederate battle flag is not a problem.

t1_dta465a	0.493900	*	Thats not a roll one one. Roll ones have a plastic top through which the deoderent is dispensed through. Ive only seen roll one style deodorant for women. 
t1_dt6b7f9	0.000000	*	I Was being sarcastic. Who cares if they have women you find attractive?  Irrelevant to the topic of global hegemony

t1_dsw59hl	-0.401900	*	Different guy. John Key had the pony tail fetish, and Bill English (who took over when John Key resigned) was the spaghetti pizza guy.

t1_dskza39	-0.757900	*	Many European countries don't have quite the same conception of free speech as the US, hate speech is excluded. Is the system in say, Germany, really so bad?
t1_dt2atr4	0.190900	*	I mean.  It's also treason. I think he should have been protected too. 
t1_dsy29cq	0.000000	*	Because it screws over people who benefit from government programs and fosters a culture of tax avoidance that leads to a collapse in government funding.

t1_dspfvsq	0.916900	*	They are distributing it.  Because of that the videos will always be out there for pervs to watch forever and ever.  Prosecution sound like the right thing to do. 
t1_dt8tgtx	0.000000	*	Worst trade deal in history. 
t1_dtcnvvx	0.000000	*	What does being landlocked have to do with needing to import food? The midwest of the USA is landlocked but they absolutely don't need to bring in food from anywhere else.

t1_dsq9vek	0.000000	*	What?
t1_dt4jag4	-0.102700	*	If youre going off solely the 20s bit of the car then yes. If youre going by masses of antifa gathering, provoking, and attacking, then its apparent both sides play a role in the conflict

t1_dtl1693	0.951400	*	I...*sigh*
t1_dtel1h6	0.451500	*	The great filter is a bit of a misnomer. We already had a Great Filter around the time humans expanded out of Africa. How many do we expect to go through?

t1_dsn35w8	0.000000	*	What if he's lying in his death bed and thinks fuck it? Considering his life style and his already growing health problems, this isn't very far fetched. His life expectancy is probably below 40.

t1_dtjegl2	-0.866800	*	Honestly, as long as the administration throws the first punch, any protesters involved will be seen as the good guys. Nonviolent resistance is absolutely crucial at the beginning.
t1_dt91nlf	-0.930800	*	I hate maga as much as the next person, but I can understand the frustration of being called out for whataboutism and see others get away with it because they hate Trump.

t1_dsi78ac	0.718400	*	I disagree. Free markets naturally seek a distribution of power. The only way power becomes concentrated in monopolies is with the intervention and support of government regulation.

t1_dtceinl	-0.557400	*	Phytoplankton : If these guys die, then yes, no more oxygen for us (in terms of enough to stay alive). Which is why ocean acidification is such a big fucking deal.

t1_dshdsmo	0.000000	*	They offer plans that they know will be rejected because a two-state solution is not what Israel wants.  Tell me, making Jerusalem the capital, is that a move towards peace?

t1_dshye5e	-0.802000	*	The hands of the people aka uncalloused trust fund child hands? That was a misnomer used to fool Republicans and independents.

t1_dtoh9hs	-0.624900	*	Ye just like how Hitler was against the use of poison gas in warfare, since he suffered from gas attacks himself in WWI.    He didn't object to using gas in other ways though...
t1_dsew4lz	-0.034300	*	How does one tank a census?
t1_dta6wyu	-0.985700	*	Threats are illegal. But for mean words there is a different between people saying you shouldn't say that and the government fining or suing you.

t1_dsng8ua	0.952700	*	Which is why they want to open the industry up.  So they can call those standards an unfair trade practice that harms consumers by forcing them to buy more expensive 'organic' milk.
t1_dsp1biv	-0.722700	*	Did I stutter?
t1_dsim17i	0.636900	*	then he probably shouldn't have bothered saying it in butchered Mandarin, if he doesn't even have the time for phonetic memorization.

t1_dsxh259	-0.296000	*	Spain or the oil slick?
t1_dso2xy9	0.000000	*	But you support the people who did. Your comment history is also filled with racist bullshit, so I doubt you'll find much symapthy.

t1_dsodkm2	0.318200	*	Different political system? I guess that's one way of a way of putting it. The ethnic cleansing is certainly a bit different from our system admittedly.

t1_dt03up8	-0.381800	*	In U.S. history, probably not.  In my lifetime, which extends back to Nixon, definitely the worst.

t1_dtc02df	-0.709600	*	To be fair, the people in that area of the world has been doing this shit to themselves for ages. After the 8 millionth needless suicide attack I fail to see how anyone should care.

t1_dtac0sa	-0.181500	*	As an American, I wish Americans would stop calling each other Nazis, as well.
t1_dsjd52o	-0.316400	*	They don't even have to do that, they can just ignore it and double down on Hillary's emails

t1_dsp1vmw	0.077200	*	they spend millions upon millions on these things and reddit thinks it can just cleverly say ha they are made of metal so a mere magnetic detector would just solve it!, its obviously not that simple
t1_dsnyx00	-0.542300	*	Just pointing out there are extremists on both sides
t1_dtmdtfb	-0.440400	*	Probably a democrat policy.   They'd rather invite the terrorists than the ones fighting them.
t1_dsu9ixc	-0.851900	*	> NHL and KHL players are not allowed to compete this year.  Why?
t1_dtgm2fq	-0.796400	*	> when they win congress back from republicans.  *If....* Theyre way too busy fighting amongst themselves to be effective. 
t1_dtdzv2n	0.000000	*	Still make it but differently
t1_dthfj4m	-0.534600	*	You said they want Trump out.  How are you going to get Trump out without impeachment?

t1_dsvezm3	-0.591300	*	If I just liked the sound of my own voice Id post on TD where everyone agrees with me. Dissent is very strange isnt it?
t1_dtg3vid	0.226300	*	Is it essentially a poll?
t1_dtbx2zk	0.000000	*	Its funny on this site. People are so fast to point out Christians as the worst people ever and any criticism about muslims gets downvoted into oblivion. Its pretty interesting 
t1_dtbvvbt	-0.542300	*	Do you have an example of sanctions violations, or just talking points?
t1_dsscd8a	-0.025800	*	Ah I see you are one of those only my kind of socialism is true socialism people.
t1_dsyx8nd	0.000000	*	Lol
t1_dt76pxp	0.361200	*	Its sad that even non trump supporters get downvoted for voicing their skepticism. 
t1_dtspo50	0.000000	*	Why do you think that's any different from the UK when people say lets go kill all the muslims ??? seriously you can't threaten violence in either country it's not a difficult concept
t1_dtjkra2	-0.909500	*	It wouldn't matter who the president was, they aren't going to stop because of some sanctions they don't recognize
t1_dst9on1	0.690800	*	Why do you think it would? They deny anything regardless of logic and many of their constituents believe whatever they spew out 
t1_dtqkxkf	-0.549900	*	I think every router I've had in the last several years allows you to spoof the WAN port MAC.
t1_dtjsdyu	-0.462400	*	I added the second part.
t1_dt19bb9	-0.238900	*	You aren't rick. I don't think I am trying to be Rick. Also I am making a reference you dog 
t1_dslyx5e	0.000000	*	If the Mongolians were first, where did the original inhabitants come from? 
t1_dsh31lm	-0.421500	*	Which is why I used the future tense in my comment instead of the past tense. I'm not entirely sure what the point of your comment is to be honest.
t1_dtbsrsz	-0.226300	*	He's being sarcastic because of the idiotic / malicious comment he's referring to
t1_dsmaii6	-0.102700	*	Oh, can they feel stressed or get a sense of panic? Its not as horrible as the pain as being boiled alive, but there has to be something negative about it right?
t1_dskzsx7	0.493900	*	Which is why when Obamacare happened I went on to pay double what I was already paying for healthcare 
t1_dsjrij4	0.000000	*	Probably a dumb question, but why does he have a bad rep?
t1_dswtlsf	-0.051600	*	Congressmen saying a document exists, and talking about a recorded vote in which Democrats voted in lockstep to refuse to release it, is absolutely news no matter what your opinion on it is.

t1_dt2os3l	0.000000	*	You forgot to mention that Im very good looking. Didnt you look at my photo?
t1_dsh07ul	0.304900	*	Make sense, is the west who wants to put him in jail on bullshit charges. I guess in his mind is like fuck you
t1_dszwqqo	0.000000	*	Conservatives are the ones helping Russia undermine our democracy by looking the other way because it helps them.
t1_dskryyo	0.000000	*	Not everyone in the USA is a high school senior with almost no job experience and a stock broker.  We are a shit hole in many ways compared to just about every industrialized nation. 
t1_dsyi1u2	0.069800	*	Same thing with breakfast. Big Mac or Quarter Pounder? Meh. Sausage or egg mcmuffin? Holy god I'm hungry right now
t1_dslaxc8	-0.848100	*	Go check the numbers kid. 
t1_dt17iu9	-0.879300	*	I honestly think that formalizing murder is not a good idea but whatever, the only thing that differenciates a murderer and the guy who kills convicts is that the last one is a legal murderer
t1_dsnwjsk	0.875000	*	Trump supporters are well-known for voting, and taking other actions, that go against their own self-interest. Stupidity is not exclusive to any one race.
t1_dtuaeuw	0.000000	*	Nobody is blowing it in anyones faces, give me a fucking break. The wind might blow some over your way but thats it. 
t1_dtropd7	-0.401900	*	No, you dinglebat. Oceania has always been in war with Eastasia, nor Eurasia.
t1_dtg5sfa	0.000000	*	Your boyfriend must be loaded if his parents are that wealthy . . . which might be actual entitlement 
t1_dt0jsp2	0.296000	*	Even brothers compete for their parents attention as babies, we all compete all the time.
t1_dt9wrpq	0.340000	*	Imo bipartisanship accelerates the extremists. When there is no middle ground one gravitates to the poles.
t1_dsndsiw	-0.526700	*	Please disregard the previous alert or thereabouts does not take 38 minutes to think up.  Did they have to page Don Draper to write it or something?
t1_dsycnf7	0.000000	*	My childhood friend's dad does this for a living. All you have to do is look like you belong, and walk with a purpose. And dress the part
t1_dtomu6b	-0.746900	*	To people like these, the idea of the world ending is somewhat of a relief (from the ones I know and have talked to)
t1_dsrxc7e	0.214400	*	Holy logical fallacy, Batman...
t1_dtmsea9	0.000000	*	Hahaha. Oh man 
t1_dsz64mc	0.980300	*	If I were a CEO and can get 60% of the performance at one-tenth the cost, why would I not do it? should I forego profit because of love towards my countrymen?
t1_dtdnk8s	-0.599400	*	Yes, neither of those are occupying foreign lands and denying millions of people citizenship. 
t1_dtsfhhh	0.000000	*	Its not. I was simply using her campaign ads as evidence to disprove your statement.
t1_dt8yp7t	0.381800	*	Serious question: Why are you *so* fucking dishonest? You must be aware that it only makes *you*, personally look like a complete arse. Why even bother? 
t1_dtawyyl	0.557400	*	Or you know. Shot in a mugging ... where they took nothing... across the street from the Kremlin... during a camera outtage.
t1_dsziw4u	0.000000	*	If I should boycot business for the opinions of owners, it would near impossible to find a kebap in Europe.  Political boycotts are creepy.
t1_dtmski7	0.931700	*	He's the deputy to the foreign minister - and France doesn't set EU trade policy anyway.  Literally fake news... jesus people...
t1_dt2l1kf	0.000000	*	Most people who grow up in cults are happy too. They just have different values.

t1_dt3m24u	0.381800	*	Because that has worked out soooo well for every communist regime that has ever existed. 
t1_dtj873o	0.765000	*	Military autocracy/dynasty. 
t1_dsjw38b	0.421500	*	Good thing were talking about Nigerian immigrants 
t1_dse7btp	-0.619900	*	Bullshit. Not every American. Most of us didn't vote for him. Most of us are anti-Trump. That's like saying Kim is representative of all North Koreans. 
t1_dsjqmn2	0.851900	*	Wait, so if the immigrants that are coming are smart, wealthy, and not bringing crime then why does it matter what county they come from? What is the point you are trying to make?
t1_dsp9pp7	0.000000	*	that's why i only drink single malt liquor
t1_dtbqtu2	0.066700	*	Once a catastrophe has struck money is useless for all those effected. At this point blood sweat and tears are currency.
t1_dtlaueo	0.000000	*	That's true, and I'm sure education level and good paying jobs help as well.   
t1_dsksalx	-0.242400	*	Norway without oil wouldn't be poor - it would be like Denmark, which is a rich country. Oil made Norway go from rich to stupid-rich
t1_dtvzz6k	-0.938200	*	Same argument of you judging your taste buds above an animals life though. Not sure if you're even trying to dispute that though 
t1_dsqn08y	0.296000	*	There are people outside of the US and Europe?
t1_dskn3jp	-0.493900	*	Which shouldnt matter for an embassy honestly 
t1_dt9wa3h	-0.153100	*	I thought of exactly this. Subjective use of the word, real. I'm an education major and I work in a middle school helping kids with math. I would consider that real education too. 
t1_dttadxd	0.075400	*	i mean... more democrat supporters showed up to vote than republicans but ok. It's about not caring enough, not about a fundamentally broken political system
t1_dswpzvh	0.482800	*	Does it have a birth certificate? Was it viable for life outside of the womb at its stage of development?   Easy answers really. 
t1_dtopzlf	0.128000	*	They are, however, vocal and irritating if you live in the region.
t1_dsjuiae	0.000000	*	NBC is broadcast. Theres a very real chance they could get FCC fines for saying that during prime time.

t1_dscyyxc	0.421500	*	What? I'm saying the market price is affected by gov. subsidies.
t1_dsh721t	0.890300	*	Sorry the border gave you troubles :( the BC-washington borders used to be so nice but the last year or two ive found the Canadian guards get increasingly aggressive. 
t1_dt9wato	0.361200	*	Well, you don't *truly* know if she got your back until you break  your arms.
t1_dtahnc5	0.381800	*	That honestly did get a laugh out of me.
t1_dtg8w6a	-0.848400	*	A lot of colonies benefitted greatly from British stewardship. I went to Singapore last year and it was amazingly prosperous, as is Hong Kong. 
t1_dsdkp8l	0.038700	*	I don't like lumping everything in as one. There are alright religious practicing people that don't use it to justify being dicks to other humans.
t1_dt5u1wb	-0.784500	*	Right, so they're not involved in human trafficking. They're people that are in violation of one of the dumbest laws in existence.
t1_dt6nirc	-0.718400	*	You don't fully grasp religion if you don't see the obvious irony, redditors are just pointing it out.
t1_dt9xqgw	0.726900	*	Currently Yahoo is clickbait nonsense. 
t1_dsd9jla	0.296000	*	The term cuffed is used at times to refer to people being in a relationship. Also used is cuffed up. That's why I found this pun funny. 
t1_dswhwjq	-0.493900	*	Treating someone equally under the law does not equal supporting their positions.   Also, you clearly don't actually know what a logical fallacy is.
t1_dsq5yh5	0.153100	*	This is the best and most complete inversion of reality I've seen today. Congratulations.
t1_dt9fruc	0.000000	*	Sir, you wound me! I am only supporting your clearly presented and totally level headed and might I add intelligent and completely sane rational stable genius theories! 
t1_dso02kw	0.000000	*	You speaking on behalf of all conservatives?
t1_dttcth2	0.296000	*	Let them eat cake.
t1_dtauwy1	-0.296000	*	> It's rumored because Putin was married to his wife when she was born and she isn't her mother.  Could you please repeat that with fewer pronouns this time?
t1_dswomlm	-0.318200	*	Because it is a live fetus. If you have to fall back on extreme outlier cases where the mother's life is in danger to justify abortion as a whole, it shows how weak the argument is.
t1_dsrnbrr	-0.739100	*	Doesn't the US have ballistic missiles?
t1_dtqq7oh	-0.205700	*	Maybe list a few for me? I'll start off: 1. you can't vote
t1_dsm5szi	0.952400	*	Ah yep, I heard it was best in Europe but I didnt know everyone was mirin. 
t1_dthr0jz	0.000000	*	And? Have any of you ever set foot on a university campus?
t1_dsmttcd	0.000000	*	Which makes them a prime target. The Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor for a reason. Crippled the Pacific fleet, we just managed to rebuild and expand it within months 
t1_dswmpmt	0.808500	*	It works out well enough here in Canada. We wave and cheer when a royal comes by, they don't bugger around with us, and as a result nobody really cares that we're kinda-sorta a monarchy. 
t1_dt91cu4	0.214400	*	That depends on how inappropriate the behavior was.
t1_dt9w4wm	-0.457400	*	Not on Reddit where anyone who's not doing CompSci or Engineering is wasting their money and time 
t1_dtusxyb	0.000000	*	Moon and Mars will probably have colonies before 2050.
t1_dsunxpt	0.000000	*	Because theyre duplicitous hypocrites.   Both sides are not the same. 
t1_dtqpslq	0.571400	*	Yeah I guess my point was that it would be quite rare for an Indian with a PhD or medical degree to drive a cab in Canada. They would much rather go back to India.
t1_dt1juz6	-0.882500	*	Dead wrong bro, republicans are traitors 
t1_dsli61v	0.000000	*	Are those lambchops or interrobangs?

t1_dsut9cx	-0.966500	*	You also voted thinking Mexico was going to pay for that wall, huh?  Funny shit. 
t1_dtf9nm4	0.970900	*	> clearly tongue-in-cheek comments  It could be that you just think comments are this when they aren't?   I mean, if it were tongue in cheek it aught to be funny, right? 
t1_dsivl2o	0.000000	*	Really? Most Americans hail him as a Hero, last time I checked. I've yet to meet anyone who disagrees with what Snowden did.
t1_dstklya	0.000000	*	The entire Andromeda galaxy can fit in a picture. Your button is bigger?
t1_dtqioxu	-0.824600	*	Have you ever heard of Occam's razor? Gun accident versus child murder-whisperer
t1_dta0b2n	0.250000	*	More like a thousand. The Guardian has it just over 1,000 for 2015 and 2016. Washington Post has a little less than that.
t1_dslxnnl	-0.526700	*	it would be hard to top this group (Bush), in terms of absurdity   Oh, sweet summer child, if you only knew then...
t1_dtitrgn	-0.526700	*	Yes, your apparent inability to detect sarcasm is definitely other people's fault.
t1_dt0g5ho	0.000000	*	Because that's the detail that truly matters to me.
t1_dtkb049	0.153100	*	I have the white part covered. Now I have to eat more cheese and I'll be rich
t1_dsnutkw	0.000000	*	Typically the best part of the video(s).
t1_dt6138c	0.000000	*	Possibly but I think most of the controversy should be focused on the fact the people withholding it think it's misleading as opposed to just releasing it and letting people decide for themselves.
t1_dt50gpv	0.000000	*	they don't, workers in Canada aren't doing the kinds of things workers in Vietnam are.  we outsourced those jobs to Alabama and Mexico decades ago.

t1_dtsop3x	0.000000	*	This isn't an issue to Maude Flanders over. Feelings never get us anywhere, you have to use logic. X jobs, y workers. When y gets much bigger than x, everyone suffers but the businesses
t1_dtro9za	0.000000	*	I'm too old to give a shit about managing my friends in a database. That's for teenagers with plenty of free time. It's easier to just not post in public.
t1_dt6nhkt	-0.815100	*	Seek help
t1_dsr5nm3	0.605000	*	How's that tap water tasting?
t1_dsfhjkd	0.421500	*	That's almost entirely because colleges tend to use bleachers rather than actual seats. You can fit more people in when you get rid of things like armrests and cupholders. 
t1_dsvpmsz	0.939500	*	What deregulation specifically? How do tax cuts help the U.S. catch up with societies with stronger economies, all of which have higher taxes?
t1_dsl35xw	0.000000	*	Honestly yes. You can be a good person while still clinging to some bad beliefs. 
t1_dses860	0.140600	*	I mean, tides are caused by gravity, and gravity is one of the least understood phenomenons in contemporary physics. 
t1_dt9yjwy	-0.143100	*	so are a ton of business, so... discriminate away?
t1_dt4qwx4	-0.381800	*	they always have to be a part of everything...

t1_dsdp5su	0.414400	*	Full nodes have all wallet blockchains too so they would detect it. 
t1_dt50ndw	-0.077200	*	Are you an alcoholic too? That would account for the brain damage necessary to extrapolate your anecdotal evidence to millions of people around the country. 
t1_dt6mxgj	0.659700	*	He actually said quite the opposite. The church is open to civil unions he said

t1_dt9cjao	0.362600	*	If theyre referring to liberals as libs can we refer to conservatives as cons?
t1_dsn2kcs	0.482800	*	I disagree. R's and D's may both be corrupt and have policies you disagree with, but your argument is essentially equating Charles Manson with Justin Bieber because they're both humans.

t1_dsinhxt	-0.970200	*	Because it would be assumed she's staying with someone? She was staying at her maternal aunt's house while her parents were away. No one in their right mind would leave a child alone for weeks.

t1_dsxk0fn	0.000000	*	Im not sure why Carl is getting thumbs down. Yours are the most logical comments on the thread. 
t1_dta8ecp	0.425700	*	Fair enough. I will concede that the concept of free speech in general is a difficult thing to define. Which is probably why each country has defined it differently. Thanks for the open dialogue!
t1_dtktpmw	-0.836000	*	Every meat consumer reading this thread knows that now.   Do you think they're going to make any changes to their diet after reading this?

t1_dt2cfmm	0.614600	*	The difference is that in the United States, you're permitted to have different values without being hunted by the state. Maybe it's all well and good in Beijing, but what about Tibet?

t1_dtfzw8i	0.388200	*	Almost every state could be a swing state if more people voted. The only reason Texas is a solid red state is because Texans don't vote.

t1_dt4ga74	0.077200	*	If were talking literally? He's overweight, but whether you think he's a good president or not is completely objective. I just don't agree with the way he treats minorities in his country.

t1_dtapl6y	0.361200	*	Why? Virtually all of them live in the bright areas. There's a correlation there...
t1_dswtyox	0.000000	*	That's racist garbage. Don't post it here.
t1_dt4mjh8	-0.385500	*	There's nothing xenophobic about acknowledging that poor and uneducated immigrants contribute less to the economy than wealthy and educated ones.  It wouldn't kill you to acknowledge basic facts.  
t1_dsf4852	-0.659700	*	>They had 17 years to do something to legalize their stay and did nothing.  Why do you people keep saying that? What were they supposed to do exactly?
t1_dsq5nyk	-0.374400	*	You were suggesting it couldn't have happened because it wasn't a rigidly logical way to remove a hijab. 
t1_dssa3fe	-0.823700	*	What is that anyway, have we really gotten that cynical?
t1_dtvbebe	-0.897700	*	Literally why though? It clearly isn't giving the U.S. any leverage now that nations simply feel entitled to that money.
t1_dt3ezrt	0.000000	*	http://fortune.com/2017/02/07/us-solar-jobs-2016/  Wasn't that hard to look up the numbers. 38K in manufacturing, 130K in installing. Much more believable.

t1_dtv5e9t	0.000000	*	The EU is majority white but maybe you didn't know this?  Also I didn't know race had much part to play in economic security. Do you reckon this is why Africa is poor?
t1_dstyirq	-0.816900	*	Do you think they'll ever give up any control? What is the carrot leading them to exactly?
t1_dt6o6gg	0.700300	*	I feel the same way about shrooms, but it's a mindset that you can try to emulate without shrooms as well. I think besides that, you might calm down a bit when you get older
t1_dswb0hg	-0.795300	*	A lot of people in social housing want to buy but are unable to get mortgages. They don't want to move to another rental that will waste even more of their money.

t1_dslalx8	-0.140600	*	It's definitely biased (and moreover has become way more opinionated than journalism is supposed to be).  But to say that it is only the left that is responsible is just not true.

t1_dtco44o	0.340000	*	So if human fetuses tasted great with salt, pepper, some rosemary, thyme, and a few lemon slices, would you serve them over rice to your family? 
t1_dsupufj	-0.532400	*	Saying that Trump is unscathed at this point really is alternative facts.  He's being raked through the coals, and just keeps digging deeper and deeper.    Hey, I finally get his coal miner fetish!
t1_dt03fsh	0.000000	*	Any stories /articles about the money laundering? 
t1_dtchv0b	0.250000	*	I'm being serious. I completely agree that his stance is bullshit, but reducing it to gibberish is just childish. You apparently don't check your spelling before posting either. Stop fueling the fire.

t1_dsjvq67	0.000000	*	Which historical documentary is that?  ( Seriously though, I don't know that movie and feel like I should )
t1_dswomlm	0.000000	*	Because it is a live fetus. If you have to fall back on extreme outlier cases where the mother's life is in danger to justify abortion as a whole, it shows how weak the argument is.
t1_dtf9vbf	0.542300	*	She's one person, and a fucking moron at that.

t1_dto90hp	0.000000	*	I think he means crossing the border wasn't a big deal. You just show your driver's license, military ID, or birth certificate and they let you on through.

t1_dt5qxyo	-0.542300	*	Why would someone complain about being called a Nazi after marching with a swastika? I'm not sure this is thought out very well.

t1_dsdhuv7	0.000000	*	Buying it up costs money.  If they then decide to kill the integrity of the system, they would lose a lot of money because no one would want to invest anymore...  That's the theory, anyway

t1_dtwo2n6	0.000000	*	Yeah, it's not meant as an actual possibility. More like a hyperbole meaning I would rather die than have him as my PM. The Israeli version of moving to Canada is probably moving to Berlin.
t1_dt4sgsm	0.000000	*	Came back from there 2 days ago, where did you find shrooms? I saw signs saying magic mushrooms but I thought they changed it so selling mushrooms wasnt allowed.

t1_dtr8njk	-0.885800	*	That's a good point. I'm just saying that labeling something as terrorism or not terrorism is tricky, because you'd have to determine if something is political, which gets really messy.
t1_dtriha3	0.102700	*	Nazism is a form of fascism with bonus racism. Fascism is traditionally regarded as far-right.

t1_dtwrp6y	0.000000	*	Oh, I'm guessing you have proof Russia colluded with Trump? Because it makes total sense that Trump would be bending over backwards for Israel, who Russia isn't very fond of.

t1_dtwturm	-0.981400	*	Is English *your* first language?  It was clearly an appeal to the Americans are ignorant stereotype.  Dont be purposefully obtuse.

t1_dsogfiq	-0.476700	*	For anyone curious: Pie Iesu domine, dona eis requiem is actual latin: Merciful Lord Jesus, grant them rest. And it's a legit part of a funeral.   The head-slapping-boards, not so much.
t1_dtwvi29	0.000000	*	Uh poop does have a strong correlation to cancer.  Inadequate fiber intake is a risk factor for colorectal cancer because your poop sits inside you for much longer than it should. 
t1_dt78ug8	0.000000	*	You are the reason why I will support a 10 year bond on all students paid for by canada's taxes. Either that or pay the full unsubsidized cost of your education if you want to leave.

t1_dt07uak	-0.612400	*	Fair enough, your choice. I was just a bit surprised. Seems like a fairly small amount to avoid some nasty complications. I guess it would depend on how badly messed up it was.
t1_dtcgpsg	0.250000	*	What's wrong with harmless? Navalny is harmless, as in he can't do anything to harm Putin. There is nothing wrong with the sentence.
t1_dthg5af	-0.153100	*	Intent and justification are two different things. You projected intent based on your own insecurities. Hard to take anything you say seriously. 
t1_dtrwe38	-0.102700	*	Yeah but in the West, a government employee would just show you where a map would be. No real need for a bribe there haha.

t1_dt6jlmn	0.051600	*	>The Liberal Party is just a socially liberal Tory party.   as a former Tory, that sounds perfect which is why I'm a card carrying liberal now.

t1_dtdb941	0.790600	*	That's not entirely true.  Novgorod was dependent on Kiev for a long time.  Russia (among others) draw ancestry from kievian rus.  So no, Russia does not have a long history of democracy

t1_dt1kbpz	-0.775800	*	Great point. It's time we stopped demonizing Islamism and Nazism.  After all, us not embracing jihadists and neonazis and insulting Muhammad and Hitler only makes them more likely to feel alienated.

t1_dsliuk9	0.128000	*	To be fair any language, other than English, isn't a big language for Americans.  And even English poses problems, or so I've noticed.
t1_dszt3cq	0.000000	*	Why lord
t1_dte0ijj	-0.648600	*	Well it was much easier before the Soviet era, no easy means of mass communication. Soviets had to perfect it because of all the new technologies and access to information.

t1_dtnqzmr	-0.296000	*	We don't know all the facts. We only know some facts, and we are extrapolating what the other facts are based on our political leanings. 
t1_dsj0803	0.000000	*	Bro how should I know that he bought cheap? He could have literally bought a few days ago just to use bitcoin as currency. 
t1_dtlo60v	0.000000	*	Anti Israel and anti semitism are not the same thing. But they are definitely related.   That being said still plenty of anti semitism on the left.
t1_dttwknz	-0.571900	*	We'd do that but the GOP is very against anything that helps government function. They're nothing but saboteurs

t1_dt34fuj	-0.365800	*	I challenge you to edit a single Wikipedia page. Especially on a topic that would get a research paper assigned in school.
t1_dsdkwls	0.827600	*	People are super-excited about the technology: super-fast confirmations (2-7 seconds), 100% feeless, very little energy use. DAG tech like IOTA. It was designed to be the new Bitcoin.
t1_dsi43pf	-0.296000	*	I doubt it would. Have you not heard all the shit he said that has had no effect on him whatsoever?
t1_dslq8ou	0.296000	*	Like an attack helicopter?
t1_dt1ivzr	0.661700	*	Which is the main reason why China can act swiftly once a decision is made. Democracy allows and encourages people to discuss and argue, but this also leads to useless squabbling. 
t1_dt7ao29	0.883700	*	You really think China and Russia are going to start WWIII just because the US might be able to stop nukes? What's your logic there?
t1_dsx4930	0.000000	*	oh yes ( xb0  xb0)

t1_dssxx5d	-0.493900	*	It's more or less irrelevant anyway. The real issue is that he is a textbook narcissist. Someone with an ego as fragile as his should not be running this country. 
t1_dt7vzgs	0.000000	*	One of the reasons thorium reactors, fusion, etc., don't have more funding is exactly because people are afraid of nuclear power. You can't have your cake and eat it too.

t1_dss384v	0.000000	*	So don't be 90% of reddit. 
t1_dsmav9c	0.000000	*	Its not that simple. A seller wont accept a suitcase full of cash, so youll give them a certified cheque, which comes from a bank. So the money needs to go through shell companies first. 
t1_dtbvgef	-0.281000	*	Thats not the point. What atheist society developed a robust morality or was even remotely successful?  You think you are responsible for your own values, dont you? Lol
t1_dsgwhkq	0.493900	*	Elitism or not, it's still true.
t1_dtbnlpw	0.401900	*	Red tape is synonymous for regulation, guy.

t1_dtgr4gd	0.000000	*	I used to hunt a lot when I was kid. Pheasants and deer. Of the maybe dozen times I went deer hunting I never even SAW a single deer. Pheasants were a different story though.
t1_dskzeya	0.128000	*	Thanks.  I thought I was cool for not needing to type the word degreesxb0 (Alt+0176), but this one is almost certainly more useful.
t1_dsiz73r	-0.102700	*	I guess if the populace believes that it will become true. That's why I choose not to believe that despite our history. Those ideals live in me, and I hope one day you will find them again.
t1_dtqt3va	0.556300	*	I boycott any companies that support Israel, no matter where they are.
t1_dtk5vda	-0.421500	*	All destroying them does is reduce supply, without effecting demand. That will just increase how much they're sought after.
t1_dtbw24l	0.381800	*	And some [Nazis actually shielded the Chinese](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rabe).  Funny how they could both see the evil in each other's actions but not their own.
t1_dsfe9ht	0.775400	*	North Korea always makes a peaceful talk after they do their crazy dance. 
t1_dtax4u1	-0.981400	*	How the fuck is making fun of someones appearance misogynistic?   Edit: For shits and giggles go to this persons profile and ctrl+f misogyny
t1_dtk6ozx	-0.296000	*	Medically, mutilation literally means to cut off a part of the body.  Why would using the correct term to describe a procedure be an insult?
t1_dtoln5a	0.000000	*	Please make sure to contact your primary care physician, if you haven't already. The flu is particularly virulent this year, and people are often much more Ill than they think.

t1_dsv1mvb	-0.857300	*	there seems to be a lot of effort and energy being put into this, without much potential for a result.  If everyone knows Trump won't be impeached, why are they bothering?
t1_dsevsw2	0.000000	*	Only way to make everything sustainable is to have less people 
t1_dt6x2z1	0.115400	*	Hiw about size for starters. 
t1_dsmc7ar	0.421500	*	But it's a fiction celebrating resisting invasion by impure races, and those races were other whites. That's a lot of xenophobia baked in.
t1_dttcgwr	0.000000	*	> genuine hurt on a of couple faces.  Hurt?  Are you sure they weren't confused.  Canadians are in no way like Americans.  
t1_dsht8j1	0.493900	*	It's a hard concept because muricans don't seem to care that their country is up to the same shady business as the Russians
t1_dt9wsn9	0.361200	*	Honestly I would be impressed at their knowledge of East Germany for the communist remark. 
t1_dtfbi2n	0.000000	*	True, but just because the terms sound equivalent does not mean the procedures are equivalent.
t1_dsge2vu	-0.749100	*	did we surrender? did we fuck.
t1_dsd74c9	-0.177900	*	I'm not British, and i agree with you somewhat.   Brits are just more self aware and less hypocritical about it.
t1_dthc6kk	-0.659700	*	Someday everyone is going to realize there has been a class war going on. 
t1_dsojqnw	0.000000	*	Tres commas
t1_dtosfqs	0.000000	*	Well actually they lost more wars than they have won. Far more. Not to mention the retreat out of Vietnam and the embarrassment in the middle east.
t1_dtq2lfm	-0.743000	*	Thank you for the sanity.    It's not some racist, anti gay conspiracy theory.   People need to stop thinking tv sensationalism and inject a little realism into their perspective.
t1_dsxlyxx	0.051600	*	What aspects of pregnancy would make it a non ideal situation? Sure it's going to be tough for her, but what situations related to this would cause NZ to be worse off?
t1_dttpnbl	0.703400	*	Here comes the reddit commies.   When you compare the wrongdoings of western governments to the wrongdoings of communist governments and see equal wrong, you're the one in need of a wake up call.
t1_dt61kmp	0.007600	*	No. Morality and ethics are an inherent human trait. A lack of this indicates sociopathy, doesn't it?  You're implying atheists are unethical by nature
t1_dsmn4a6	0.444900	*	The US is literally one of the greatest places to live in history.
t1_dsdnuah	0.000000	*	How about a source, my dude. Thanks for the quotes.
t1_dsf9a1t	-0.659700	*	extremely divided my ass.  Average Americans love each other and country. Propaganda media gives attention to the extreme outliers. Don't be naive.

t1_dskkajh	-0.700300	*	As opposed to it being decided by the same four swing states every four years? Pick your poison. I'm going with the educated states. 
t1_dszxans	-0.296000	*	Why does it matter if the other Arab nations refuse to take the land, the Palestinians want to be independent anyways. Not part of Egypt or Jordan

t1_dtarry6	0.726900	*	official story is BS. Don't think that Putin would do it that way. More the polonium guy, this imho is more mafia or something internal.
t1_dtonytj	0.670500	*	I definitely disagree. The most overt racism I ever heard was in New York. Also, the most overt sexism. I didn't even know catcalling was a real thing until I visited NYC.
t1_dskjbcg	0.000000	*	That's exactly what we are. People like ole Woody are new versions of royalty. The rest of us are peasants with smart phones, cars, and houses. Still peasants.
t1_dt6rjv2	0.571900	*	What if someone tells you to shoot your dog? Telling people to do stuff doesn't mean they do it.  So if you're in that situation here's a tip: Don't.
t1_dtkx0ci	-0.526700	*	What the fuck are either of you saying 
t1_dskl9ig	0.296000	*	It is a majority of the vote which is the only way to decide an election and has been accepted for more than 200 years in the US.

t1_dtn77gl	0.000000	*	Uhhh... its down there. Lemme take another look.
t1_dskcnlx	0.000000	*	Random fact: Benedict Arnold is buried two miles away from the new US Embassy in London.
t1_dt9cywg	0.000000	*	Don't take junk polls like that seriously.  If someone asked me something so inane and pointless, I'd give a fake answer too. 
t1_dt6l9jk	-0.493900	*	They are not cut off. They just operate under a standard tariff environment.
t1_dt1ub6i	-0.771700	*	I was a premature baby and my hospital bills were almost $2 million. In the 80s... 
t1_dtuke1p	0.000000	*	I wouldn't say they're liberal - they very much aren't. It's just that many points ascribed to liberals in the US are entirely uncontroversial in many other places in the world.

t1_dt5ohzp	-0.077200	*	He goes to home
t1_dsp0ec5	-0.836000	*	Three quarters of the world lives in poverty. No one should be hoarding resources on that scale. It's unconscionable. 
t1_dt5zzah	0.000000	*	No, I want unbiased answers period.  Information has been released.  Emails, texts from fbi, etc.. senators and others have talked about it.
t1_dtmp3fn	0.000000	*	Apple is made in China lol
t1_dt8v8vv	-0.421500	*	And it'll be even better once Brexit goes through and the NHS has another 350 million quid per week to play with.  We've all been fed lies.

t1_dt6b7xs	0.636900	*	No. It's a very filthy thing to say. I don't see how what he said years before his presidency is **actively** fueling an atmosphere against women.

t1_dsut9fp	0.000000	*	The comment was literally all sarcasm. I don't know how you missed that. Right wingers love to play up the oh you called me hitler to make attacks on the racist buffoon seem abusrd.

t1_dt8kcvx	-0.038700	*	It's not a stretch to believe the women were better qualified. Girls have been out-performing boys academically in British schools for decades. 
t1_dsiqgqz	0.297500	*	The electoral college did what it is designed to do. It prevented a few large cities (Los Angeles and New York) from determining the outcome of the election.
t1_dtthwx7	-0.932500	*	Banning specific phrase would be asinine, opponents would just change it slightly to use it with impunity. Its not how you construct a law.
t1_dt1hl5r	0.644400	*	In my mind Maintenance/Upkeep doesn't equate to prepping. 
t1_dthicwb	0.421500	*	Uncle Kevin? Are you drinking again?

t1_dsv7prq	0.000000	*	Current economic policies in South Africa discriminate against white people. This also trickles down to Indians, and even black people from other countries.

t1_dsdgfp0	0.735100	*	Your comment and my comment are not the same. Very different. Im talking behavior leading to asylum. For example being in a Muslim country and tearing up the Koran or something. 
t1_dtv2yv9	0.457600	*	Incorrect; Denmark and Sweden are both legally exempt from the Euro and use the Krone and Krona respectively.
t1_dttdth7	0.000000	*	I think the USA truly is the land of the free. But it does not apply to people. It applies to corporations and businesses.

t1_dskfpn7	-0.930000	*	You just described every politician.. thats not a republican or Democrat thing.. thats a politician thing. They all seem to only care about re-election.. not doing whats right for the country.

t1_dsnkg2b	-0.177900	*	Also the houses seem to be made out of Egyptian imported Papyrus paper
t1_dsp1zea	-0.880700	*	Wouldnt dropping the dear leader chosen by god bullshit and just generally un-fucking the populace be a better course of action than having nukes for N Korea?
t1_dsmem60	0.000000	*	No. The logic flow is: Spending time on water bugs while the planet burns around us is foolish. We have real problems to solve.

t1_dt5vdr3	-0.340000	*	If that's how you take it; then the fact of the matter is it's the reverse.   Not sure what left propaganda you are even referring to to be honest.

t1_dtg5e78	0.226300	*	Exactly my thoughts. People don't understand that if you're in the EU, you have to allow cross border transit between other members.

t1_dsoe334	0.526700	*	The 5-year maximum was set by the Parliament Act of 1911. Before that there was a 7-year limit set by the Septennial Act of 1716.

t1_dsv8ahc	-0.659700	*	Anti-semitism is considered on the same level as racism. But why play the victim card in the first place? It's not a helpful mentality.

t1_dsz1tj2	-0.465500	*	And in the meantime we allow our fellow Americans to either ruin themselves financially or die so that greedy fat cats can make another dollar. That sure doesn't sound like a strong America to me.

t1_dt8w5mz	-0.251400	*	So racism in the south is dead?   You think moving to another state is as easy as saying it on reddit? Talk about privilege...

t1_dt8u29w	0.638200	*	I kinda wish we lost the war now. It appears they figured out how to do democracy properly and still have plenty of banter at the same time (just check out any of their parliament sessions.)

t1_dtkjwrw	-0.790900	*	Seriously, the vast majority of the population supports increased funding for the NHS. I really wish people would go out and vote against these money-grabbing arseholes

t1_dt9s4nw	0.226300	*	>So, if you can fix it for me, it would make things a lot easier.  What does that mean? What can she fix for him? Fix her people?

t1_dt9su7b	-0.102700	*	I'm interested, what is your proposal to deal with groups of people harassing others in those situations? Do we just have to accept it as part of the real world?
t1_dsmtdqf	-0.510600	*	To the best of my knowledge there are no ground based interceptors or THAAD batteries currently deployed in Hawaii. You're gonna have to pray in the name of God and AEGIS.

t1_dtok7xs	-0.373400	*	Yes sure, and 80% of Swiss are racist nationalists because they think joining the EU is a shitty idea? I guess that's one way to simplify one's worldview.

t1_dsyx59i	0.000000	*	That's exactly the problem. There **isn't** a free market on healthcare in the US. If there was the prices would be as low as in other free market healthcare nations such as in India or Thailand.

t1_dszwehu	0.000000	*	There's an easier explanation and a more likely possibility. That this image is bullshit and you guys are using your science to justify it. OP hasn't even mentioned a fucking source for that image.

t1_dsv8ux7	0.000000	*	That wasn't my statement at all. I said that Americans spending more money because they got raises is not a solution.

t1_dsjwj8j	0.214400	*	I'm not disagreeing with you there. It absolutely was a bad call, but I don't think he's wrong that Haiti and El Salvador are not wealthy nations with abundance of resources aka shitholes.

t1_dsupufj	0.476700	*	Saying that Trump is unscathed at this point really is alternative facts.  He's being raked through the coals, and just keeps digging deeper and deeper.    Hey, I finally get his coal miner fetish!

t1_dstcjh0	0.599400	*	If they can basically keep swiping why is it a big problem to keep adding to it? Why has trumps reduction in taxes/increasing the debt been reacted to so badly in regard to increasing national debt?

t1_dstzgub	-0.361200	*	This might seem a technicality but you made the argument around it so, the Palestinians wouldn't be fighting for nationhood if they already had one.
t1_dt7n6ks	0.516800	*	??
t1_dtbx2zk	0.449700	*	Its funny on this site. People are so fast to point out Christians as the worst people ever and any criticism about muslims gets downvoted into oblivion. Its pretty interesting 
t1_dtqoqng	0.000000	*	Of course! Human history has been one group stealing land from other groups! That's only changed very, very recently.
t1_dtpyh8a	-0.624900	*	Sounds similar to [phossy jaw](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phossy_jaw) that matchstick factory workers would get from phosphorus inhalation.

t1_dtjw5tb	-0.457600	*	Iraq used to gas the Kurds. The Palestinians in Israel have voting rights and sit in the parliament. Nobody has voting rights in Saudi Arabia because its a monarchy.
t1_dsy0sk0	-0.361200	*	They don't have that option. Franchise owners cannot raise prices.  Edit: Yes, independent restaurants can do this and they are being forced to.

t1_dt7b1gp	0.024000	*	As a spicy mustard enthusiast, that one hit me the hardest...Republicans should know that some things you just can't take back.

t1_dshiwhd	-0.874800	*	The working class has a voice, they just refuse to use it.  If these places started having trouble finding people to fill their manpower needs, they'd start reforming.

t1_dthl6h4	0.000000	*	Well Brave might be good for you then. It's based off webkit so it's very similar to Chrome, but a built in ad blocker on mobile.

t1_dt7w55r	0.750600	*	It's cause thorium reactors aren't any good and probably because there is no funding. Instead we should increase funding for fusion power, by far the best power source we could possibly create.
t1_dt2ho41	0.977800	*	Nah I'm doing fine.  And further, it sounds like you're suggesting that the 1% are holding on to money that belongs to you and you want it back.  How do you figure?

t1_dt0q6kg	-0.453800	*	Your statement makes sense if everyone accepts it. Otherwise, we have to resort to brutality because brutally is the only thing those undeveloped minds can understand. 
t1_dt7vzgs	-0.831300	*	One of the reasons thorium reactors, fusion, etc., don't have more funding is exactly because people are afraid of nuclear power. You can't have your cake and eat it too.

t1_dsgp6cs	0.526700	*	Correlation doesnt equal causation is too often used as a way to dismiss an argument and to stop all further thought on a topic.  Causation always starts with a correlation.

t1_dsh89nn	0.542300	*	Agreed, but given the guy I was responding to, that was a can of worms I didn't want to get into.
t1_dtvntaj	0.000000	*	Your response only deals with elephants. 
t1_dskh3yk	-0.850300	*	So is the problem that Trump thinks it's a shit hole, or that it got leaked to the press?  Because I can virtually guarantee most people think it's a shit hole.
t1_dt9vd86	0.000000	*	Well, biochem teaches nothing about history or human relations, you'd need to have an education in the humanities to get that. 
t1_dt1exho	-0.051600	*	The Henry Ford Museum does not trump the goddamn Smithsonian.   Goddamn it, Michigan. Havent you done enough?

t1_dto90hp	-0.557400	*	I think he means crossing the border wasn't a big deal. You just show your driver's license, military ID, or birth certificate and they let you on through. 
t1_dsrph7e	0.000000	*	Either way, why threaten someone who has nukes?
t1_dtff7mt	0.729700	*	>Why would a local Chinese chose to play on NA or European serve when the ping is 300 at minimum?  Maybe because playing with 300 ping is still better than playing on the Chinese servers. 
t1_dtmj00z	0.894200	*	Limits your options individually but gives you much greater bargaining power against countries like the US in situations like this and subsequently better trade deals.
t1_dshnbzb	0.000000	*	https://youtu.be/LG6Xz6pKbPQ
t1_dtbzail	0.000000	*	No. Its nowhere near as black and white like that, and the only people that portray it as such are uninformed or edgelords.

t1_dsp1zea	0.585900	*	Wouldnt dropping the dear leader chosen by god bullshit and just generally un-fucking the populace be a better course of action than having nukes for N Korea?
t1_dt30v5p	-0.941300	*	If you're talking about the bomb that blew up Pendragon, IIRC that was Schneizel with the Damocles, not Lelouch. Unless there's another major bombing I'm forgetting.
t1_dt8z3ax	0.750600	*	We have the best dog, a very good boy. Everybody says how good a boy he is. Probably one of the best boys in the history of boys.

t1_dskriek	0.700300	*	Uh. He was talking about immigrants and implying immigrants from shithole countries would obviously be lower quality than say, White Netherlands immigrants.
t1_dt1b07m	0.457600	*	Sounds like China has political parties within their party. The only difference is China values experience over vanity. 
t1_dt1amtn	0.000000	*	Worth remembering that despite its typical perception, in reality water is strong, notoriously difficult to compress, and a universal solvent.
t1_dt6mfj3	0.000000	*	No, federal funding drives costs up. Always. Look at tuition costs for example.

t1_dstp5ur	0.000000	*	Happy cake day!  What evidence is there that the US and SK relationship is breaking down? Last I heard there's been more investment and joint missions than ever before.

t1_dt7q6gn	-0.312900	*	Just like Germany.
t1_dshtvy7	-0.365900	*	They make enough money to invest in the future. People in the US gave corporations the same rights as people, and yet they don't have any conscience. This is problem.

t1_dsk32nv	0.000000	*	A shithole thanks to at least 3 US coups and on-going French neo-colonialism (which hugely benefits western corporations as well).
t1_dtvmmpx	0.318200	*	Don't derail because you can't think of anything else. No country is perfect and China shines in ways that the US fails to.

t1_dt2oz14	0.000000	*	A quick google shows an average wage of 3.1k USD a month (415,000 ISK). Which isn't shit honestly. Number comes from 2015.  Compared to 2011 number of US average salary of 3.7k monthly. 
t1_dt5w500	0.190100	*	I have a Drea.  I dream of the day when I get a high karma comment on a topic that I know well and discuss in detail. Rather than a single throwaway comment in a topic where I know next to nothing.

t1_dtp0iaq	0.000000	*	Point and chew?

t1_dtpzkz7	0.700300	*	So why is rolling back regulations looked at like such a good thing? It seems like regulations are what make the USA better than others.
t1_dt8v7zl	0.624900	*	Yeah it's the exact same agreement that the White House has, *don't break our rules or you can't come to our shit*.   And when the royals are big fucking news, you're gonna play ball.

t1_dsxln7e	-0.135900	*	Not necessarily, they might want to just shoot it on their own property or out in the woods without having to go through all the legal procedures of obtaining a gun.
t1_dsgy59c	0.000000	*	Pretty juicy gossip. Allegations so wild that there would be rioting if there was evidence behind them. But thank you for the write up link.

t1_dt5out1	-0.952400	*	Positive things typically are more beneficial and compatible with living in a free and prosperous society.  Negative things, not so much in many cases.  So no.
t1_dtk889x	0.457600	*	There's Foregen that's theoretically dedicated to regrowing foreskin for people like me who regret(not that I had a choice) having their bodies damaged. So that's a cool thought.
t1_dsx8q7v	-0.025800	*	Which is honestly ridiculous. Most abortions have nothing to do with security of the person and restrict the life and liberty of the infant 
t1_dtrcie8	-0.458800	*	By that logic no tax-paying American is a civilian because they are directly funding the US military.

t1_dt8kcvx	-0.250000	*	It's not a stretch to believe the women were better qualified. Girls have been out-performing boys academically in British schools for decades. 
t1_dt1ovp2	-0.153100	*	I still think it illustrates the point well enough that barbarism is not a specifically Muslim problem.
t1_dt2nksa	0.169500	*	America basically condones what they are doing by continuing to trade with them.
t1_dt8qdxp	0.590800	*	Then tell me, what is the difference between this, and just giving you're dog a clip round the head, or a mild kick when it doesn't do what you want.   Nothing, except you'd feel worse.

t1_dsjxd1q	0.359500	*	No because they're not idiots. Just like Canada and any other country people want to go to.  But god forbid the US enforce its laws to the same extent as everyone else. That's racist.

t1_dt4sdas	0.401900	*	Just because your not there to witness it doesn't mean it doesn't happen. If a tree falls in the forest does it make any noise?
t1_dsvxynl	0.000000	*	I imagine a skyscraper has more competent people involved than a low income housing project.
t1_dsxlgi4	-0.327000	*	So you realise that the way of implementing it hasnt been established, so how can OP say he knows you need a licence when there is zero evidence?

t1_dttcve5	0.000000	*	So instead of paying the government taxes and they distribute them equally and probably a lot cheaper you'd rather pay your neighbours and they then pay the hospital? That is positively insane.

t1_dt2cfmm	-0.868700	*	The difference is that in the United States, you're permitted to have different values without being hunted by the state. Maybe it's all well and good in Beijing, but what about Tibet?

t1_dsweif6	-0.085700	*	That's what 'leftist utopia' Canada and Australia do.  I imagine our immigration program is Nazism to some Americans.

t1_dtmoevy	-0.051600	*	He's probably bitching about a personal experience he had.  It isn't standard procedure to do that. 
t1_dss4469	-0.781400	*	What you're saying then is that Trump would enslave and murder Americans if only he could? What evidence do you have of that?
t1_dtxrkgd	-0.988600	*	Citation needed? You provided it! At 1mg per kg and a standard juice having 6mg per ml, and a tank holding about 3ml on average, you'd need to vape the whole tank for 18mg of nicotine.

t1_dtenbbf	0.653100	*	Just to show you how fucked up what you just said is, that would be the equivalent of me saying I don't normally eat Jews, but tonight I'm going to hunt one down and eat it just for you.

t1_dslxlxv	0.202300	*	Now, in Roy Moore's defence, he didn't say that.  His wife did.  And that right there is the first, last, and only time I'll ever defend Roy Moore over anything at all ever.
t1_dte6dnf	-0.950600	*	Accusing a people of all being liars is the definition of bigoted.  But you are saying if independant reports come out that Turkey used Napalm it would be justified to sanction them or perhaps more?

t1_dttbqz9	-0.796400	*	That was hundreds of years ago. Australia was a penal colony, it doesn't make everyone there a criminal.
t1_dtj7ygz	0.000000	*	Well, it clearly isn't in Bravos either then.
t1_dsl96ze	0.000000	*	Those casinos were doomed to go bankrupt from the beginning. Trump massively over-borrowed to build them.

t1_dtgowmu	0.000000	*	Scotland has no republicans, free healthcare and the unicorn as a national animal. Just saying.

t1_dsirdhw	-0.440400	*	Ironically, a reason for 911 was the presence of American troops in the Arabian peninsula.  Edit: The to a.
t1_dttmch5	0.612400	*	I moved from America to the UK. Also currently being treated for potential cancer. I thank my lucky stars every day that I'm here with the NHS and not back at home. 
t1_dswd5zf	-0.318200	*	After reading my example of this stable owner, you every single example I have seen seeks to impose their anti-abortion beliefs on others.   Do you agree that this example does not meet that standard?
t1_dto7k04	0.381800	*	Wouldn't happen again. In tooth and nail, mano a mano, I'd go with Canada. But the country is seriously outclassed in military and would fold like a lawn chair does on 7pm EST on Labour Day.
t1_dtrh904	0.000000	*	They keep giving me ads for things I've bought from them. Which is fine for food or socks, but i don't need a crock pot. I already have a brand new one and Amazon explicitly knows this.

t1_dsjueym	-0.557400	*	Except his is based in historical fact while yours is based in in some disgusting rape fantasy.
t1_dt5wdt9	0.000000	*	And yet trump supporters just say they arent *real* republicans

t1_dsmglg5	0.521600	*	No, it's using science to do the best we can. Electrocution seems more humane than boiling.  Anthropomorphism would be a lobster worried about college admissions.
t1_dt2i1fp	0.273200	*	theistic evolution can literally just be evolution is true and also god exists, which does not clash with science whatsoever

t1_dt9fx3f	0.373600	*	Leaked by the American government. Not the Dutch one.
t1_dsncws1	0.842200	*	I liked it, very quick read. It's also now a podcast with some pretty good voice acting.
t1_dsrne8c	-0.401900	*	Yeah, because its totally not like the U.K. governments have a history of signing EU treaties the public didnt want  *cough*Maastricht and Lisbon*cough*  
t1_dsgc0ng	0.879800	*	New york assembly members get paid 80k+per diem and staff, your statement isn't really true at all across the states.  It hugely depends.

t1_dtn2a9d	-0.790600	*	You want to try to make your point or play games? As far as I understand it no slave labor is being used by Amazon. 
t1_dt5u74b	-0.629800	*	I dunno, you literally stated that you want Putin as dictator.  Sarcasm isn't real
t1_dsse2wq	0.000000	*	Have you read any if the quran?
t1_dsulda4	-0.444200	*	Dont forget he campaigned HEAVILY on a border tax and carried interest and NEITHER of these items made it in his bill. 
t1_dtddlpj	0.000000	*	That government was established through an invasion. Obviously that's going to sow discord and it is not necessary for democracy to prevail
t1_dt5qobx	0.636900	*	Yes. I am certainly saying that you will not disappear when you call Xi Jinping a retard on national TV.   Not to mention that it will never happen because national TV will not broadcast such things.
t1_dt1ipmu	0.000000	*	Yup. I know for a fact the wage grade employees never got paid. 
t1_dtdefod	0.000000	*	/r/AskOuija should be able to help.
t1_dtolxjq	0.000000	*	Yeah if you think about it all the weed in the world would burn up.
t1_dtg4zer	0.000000	*	Impeachment. Which won't happen because the GOP controlled Congress won't do anything. Hence, the crisis. 
t1_dtvwixg	0.000000	*	Maybe ancient middle eastern diets were missing a vitamin d source too.
t1_dtmq6l1	0.000000	*	Do you have a source for that last statement?  That seems like the newsworthy thing here.
t1_dsstgrs	-0.367800	*	Was Sword in the Stone dark?  Been a while. All Dogs was definitely pretty dark.

t1_dsq8fgl	0.000000	*	because he built a clock. are you delusional?
t1_dt9w4zp	0.421500	*	I think the best is that she's demanding the utmost respect while calling two young men Nazis, in Germany, and suggesting the police should be hassling *them,* because of their *haircuts*.
t1_dsozwrw	0.700300	*	The air anxiously declines the gift, but their words fall upon deaf ears as they are forcefully decimated into their fundamental parts.
t1_dt9d2wb	-0.123200	*	Hey, say what you want about the tenants of national socialism, at least it's an ethos. These Republicans, they believe in nothing.
t1_dsq8glv	0.931100	*	Nah, you're just trying to justify your racism. Every culture and religion had its share of shitty people just like they all have their share of genuinely good people.
t1_dtrkc0q	0.000000	*	Right. As I stated above, they believe God gave them that land.
t1_dt50tm0	0.940400	*	This fact made me wonder why people aren't rioting in the streets. A government agency is blatantly lying to us, and we just sit here and pretend their shit is snow. 
t1_dsuwbt5	0.791000	*	Seems reasonable, no?  He's a monster.
t1_dsm80h6	0.863900	*	Well if the government is not democratic you they have nothing to do with the will of its people.

t1_dslknxr	0.458800	*	Someone got the names mixed up. Lost in translation probably, or they found it to be a great prank. The Vikings, when they discovered it, named North America  Vinland, or wine land in English. 
t1_dt84hru	0.000000	*	So you have a source for that?
t1_dsx8r2x	-0.770200	*	You feel so confident about how a marine animal feels about captivity that you should make a life or death choice for an entire species based on a human concept ?
t1_dtb4cfw	-0.373600	*	I would pick Xi Xinpeng. I'd be interested to know his exact vision and plan for the future of China. (Again, honesty being a given here). 
t1_dsemupz	0.102700	*	It really is not the same as impeachment, but Prime Ministers and the President of the United States are in totally different political positions to begin with. Its almost not worth comparing. 
t1_dt76ba3	0.226300	*	No they wont.
t1_dso1a4w	0.340000	*	Don't just assume they support it though, generalisation is bad on both sides
t1_dtn3ufe	-0.700300	*	this is addressed in the memo. The corroborating information was a yahoo article (A yahoo article) that was planted by Steele. Why is the DOJ relying on a yahoo article?
t1_dsyjj2q	-0.510600	*	And you explain how the ACA mandate that people have health insurance gets stripped from another law in a rotten tax bill. 
t1_dt6lbjw	0.000000	*	That's down-right terrifying.
t1_dtkd2mx	-0.051600	*	Honest question: how do you actually give a mouse cancer?
t1_dtrgep3	0.000000	*	> five tabs deep  What is this? Amateur hour? 
t1_dtqpd16	-0.923100	*	Im guessing youre down in the pit then.  I guess we move in different circles.  Tell me, what do you bring to Swedish society?
t1_dsoxir0	0.000000	*	Sochi is also a great vacation to bask in the sun and beach (always struck as odd to hold the winter Olympics there)
t1_dt9zf8y	-0.476700	*	That would be covering up treason to help himself and his party
t1_dt2p9jp	0.670500	*	Your lack of understanding of this concept is so profound i sincerly hope your ignorance is deliberate. If you are actually just this stupid I weep for humanity.
t1_dt2ai0c	0.000000	*	Maybe I failed at reading comprehension, but I thought the statue was in the Greek state of Macedonia, not FYROM.
t1_dspnbv3	0.493900	*	What's with this trend of trying to story top horrific videos. Congrats, you did what the cartel wanted and watched that shit and continue to spread that fear.
t1_dstu4vw	-0.670500	*	What might I find?
t1_dshw3gm	-0.578900	*	So by blocking any IPs based in Russia? Couldn't they just use proxy servers, then?
t1_dsm2f9l	0.000000	*	Not really sure about that one. I can think of many places I'd rather live in the developed world before having to live in the US.
t1_dtiv26a	-0.880700	*	Yes, you're right, but in this context I'm glad they did it when I could not remember the pain of the procedure. 
t1_dshpwfu	0.247900	*	Agreed, but are there any other reports on US or other countries activities on others' elections? 
t1_dt8u5o6	0.497300	*	There used to be a joke that saying shit like this would get you put on a list.  This list of those wishing death upon the President couldn't possibly be maintained in this administration.
t1_dsgxsdz	0.448800	*	That particular one actually was a pretty significant moment in our history though. A farmer cutting holes in his peach baskets so some Americans could play basketball... not so much
t1_dtwv8q3	-0.741400	*	This makes me want to beat my head against the wall.
t1_dsfhjkd	0.000000	*	That's almost entirely because colleges tend to use bleachers rather than actual seats. You can fit more people in when you get rid of things like armrests and cupholders. 
t1_dtg1wbe	0.000000	*	Uhh, I know, what point are you even trying to make?
t1_dt7i3m5	0.000000	*	Ok, but did he set up gulags? Or murder thousands of loyal high ranking officials in cold blood? I'm genuinely curious. 
t1_dtc5dwa	0.000000	*	Not sure if serious...   So... care to substantiate why this is the only alternative?
t1_dt6vwq7	0.765000	*	So how do you decide what should be taken literally and what is just a story that you don't take seriously?   If Genesis was just a fun story, why have it in there?
t1_dtky8nz	0.440400	*	Wait didn't like 35 Russian athletes just bounce from particle facilities the moment drug testers showed up? With all 35 saying they were sick?
t1_dsmpnzh	0.325200	*	How so?
t1_dt9q2ul	0.000000	*	The edge is so annoying :/ Flat world problems
t1_dt8t7zh	0.000000	*	I explicitly *don't* declare, but I have my reasons...
t1_dta0x8o	-0.919100	*	What? How was he wrong? 
t1_dtn3n17	-0.296000	*	Its insane how a lot of reddit seems to be labeling this as nothing when it implies the worst fears about FISA.  My account is 3 years old. Do I have the right to an opinion, my lord?
t1_dta9ldy	-0.192800	*	It's partially my bad for assuming you were American by default.  Also, sorry our president is a cunt.
t1_dti5ude	-0.856600	*	Because only government agencies have corruption, right?
t1_dtk68no	0.000000	*	That's true, you can basically get whatever genetic variant of mice with the characteristics you want.

t1_dteuj2j	0.612400	*	I am but I don't get overly dramatic about it on  reddit
t1_dslv0jj	-0.951300	*	I'd stay and fight. I'd rather die on my feet than live on my knees. And a bunch of raggedy ass fuckers stood up to the greatest military power in the world to create this nation, so it can be done. 
t1_dtfdgzd	-0.318200	*	> whataboutism  This fucking word needs to find a fire and go die in it. Nothing has been so over used in recent memory.
t1_dtos92f	0.273200	*	By manchilds? I dont recall that. They were men doing their duty, not some rednecks playing dress up fatty militia.
t1_dshwa1o	-0.361200	*	Ah, the lesser-of-two-evils argument. Where the outcome is always shitty no matter what.   Well played. 
t1_dsjz3dm	0.557400	*	If the foundation of our immigration policy is irrelevant, than yeah.   How did your family end up here? How many generations until they came from some shithole?
t1_dtl5l1v	0.000000	*	Yeah, I feel sorry for a lot of Jews because of it to be honest. It would be good if everyone could just stick to hating Israel the country, rather than Jews as a religion.   
t1_dsk8ek6	-0.296000	*	Chicago metro is 10M.  St Louis metro is 3M.  10x?

t1_dt8z0y0	0.273200	*	Also, tianenmen square is to Beijing what the Washington monument is for DC. Everyone goes there. It's an awesome place
t1_dslubmd	0.431000	*	because you aren't asking where they are from, you are asking what race are you? which is completely irrelevant for any polite conversation that I can think of.
t1_dthrsqk	0.051600	*	AC3 was kinda grey, and I've heard things about AC:Rogue but I haven't played it myself.
t1_dsxg5u9	0.000000	*	Sticking them in a tank isn't conserving the species, genius.  We need to stop fucking the oceans up. That's what's going to conserve species.
t1_dtkjy8s	0.000000	*	I mean, even if it takes months to cure it, that's pretty freakin' incredible. Unless there are some crazy horrible side effects that haven't been discovered or mentioned.
t1_dsmr5uj	-0.571900	*	I haven't been able to listen to those episodes.  Maybe when I have some Valium I can be sedated enough to listen.
t1_dsojjve	0.000000	*	What the hell are you on about?   There's a difference between being deported to the gulag and being a bum in a first world country which allows you to protest, vote and say what you want.
t1_dt9q4vj	0.077200	*	nah im not getting in that uber...the driver is indian. They dont know how to drive. Im waiting for a white cab driver, sorry. what in the fuck?
t1_dtihs53	0.000000	*	You're ungrateful then. Could have left you outside, but decided to help anyway and instead of being grateful, there's only complaining that its not enough.

t1_dsihwlv	0.000000	*	The vast majority of these people aren't leaving, they're just making sure they remain part of the EU and everything it offers. They're ensuring they can travel, work, study anywhere in Europe.

t1_dst80eo	-0.700300	*	Classic reddit. We are watching a potential monumental event in American politics, one that will shape the Presidency forever, and it took two comments to get a Dumb and Dumber reference. I love it. 
t1_dsu8yen	-0.827100	*	He also has ideological sympathy for the Nordic countries. You know, the happiest countries on Earth.
t1_dsjuvdq	-0.669600	*	But most countries in Africa are shitholes compared to Norway.

t1_dskzaos	0.000000	*	When you don't care about other people, getting investors to back your schemes then pocketing the cash is quite profitable. Evil, but profitable. 
t1_dsnu0bz	-0.291100	*	>  In fact, the successes of Hamas hitting israeli military over civilians   They weren't successful. Israel just does a better job of protecting its civilians.

t1_dslz5jo	-0.691400	*	Dude how high are you right now. They weren't talking about what Trump did or didn't say, they were commenting on the poor writing in the article. Christ.

t1_dsusexz	-0.241100	*	Trump is such a goddam hypocrite, people are trying to predict the future by what Trump has negatively tweeted about pre-2016. That sub is a legit crystal ball.
t1_dtx3kda	-0.296000	*	Wrong.  If we didnt have oil we would be like Denmark.   We were fairly well off before the oil. The oil just made us the wealthiest.

t1_dtblhxg	0.708900	*	One of the only things that can turn $100 into $10,000 in a 6 weeks. Such a cheap start-up cost compared to other things, and a very consistent profit, plus the fact its fairly easy.

t1_dtq3p1n	-0.440400	*	I just don't see how that number is possible. In Canada, about 300 in 100,000 people get cancer every year. There is just no way the 1 in 2 lifetime risk is accurate.

t1_dtwxqkj	0.025800	*	He said it was about adoptions and dirt on Hillary. Sounds like quid pro quo. Russia gives you the emails stolen from Hillary and Trump backs off of sanctions.
t1_dsygkkj	0.570900	*	Much more money in working for those same agencies to identify process faults and changes. Bug business as well if he doesnt want to touch 3 letter agencies.

t1_dtg4snv	-0.770800	*	I honestly think the only reason Trudeau has gotten this far without huge amounts of scrutiny is because of the clown on the other side of the wall distracting everyone.

t1_dt9b4mf	-0.599400	*	It must be exhausting shifting this many goalposts at once.  You agree that this is not reporting on a report, yes?
t1_dtke9sx	0.558800	*	Thats not really how encoding works.  Given you can represent the four DNA values using combinations of 0s and 1s, you can encode exactly the same complexity in binary as you can with DNA.

t1_dtw8qs5	-0.095100	*	The concept of species can actually be quite arbitrary. It could, for example, refer to two population who *don't* interbreed rather than *can't* interbreed.

t1_dso4i6x	-0.649500	*	So the US military is institutionally racist and only randomly invades non white countries. Got it.
t1_dsrnexv	-0.910700	*	Since 2001 (up to end 2014), 100,000 people have died in American prisons. 1000 people in addition die every year from police shootings.
t1_dteyjz7	-0.250000	*	I love going for a dive, great suggestion!  Feel free to look through my history if you think that, but we both know your just trying to muddle the waters more, probably an alt account. Try harder.

t1_dtfcs81	0.000000	*	Then why aren't you against Mormonism or being Amish? Both communities shun anyone who leaves even spouses/parents/children which is far more likely to force people to stay.

t1_dsgg1nb	0.000000	*	Man, visited my parents last year and my dad told me that hes OK with Trump lying because sometimes you have to lie for the greater good. My parents are devout, Church-twice-a-week Christians.

t1_dtqpslq	0.708900	*	Yeah I guess my point was that it would be quite rare for an Indian with a PhD or medical degree to drive a cab in Canada. They would much rather go back to India.
t1_dt96jxi	0.000000	*	Doest that help in the fact that most major states like NY and CA vote democratic? So less populated states have a voice over more populated states?

t1_dta2ld0	-0.542300	*	It's because of the insult used. Calling someone a Nazi in Germany is different to the US. Hell, you can even deny the holocaust in America but you'd get (rightfully) fucked for that over here.

t1_dto18b1	0.493900	*	The paper is just the frontpage of your mainstream news outlet of choice kind of like how we still use the floppy icon to save something.
t1_dskyx92	0.000000	*	Hotel.

t1_dtkwk6o	-0.569600	*	I am the point where I believe protests and mass marches are about as effective as sharing social media posts, because governments can ignore those without consequences.
t1_dsl92f7	0.000000	*	Don't forget that once the conservatives shout that, the democrats will shy away and try to 'coalition build' for a half-assed result. 
t1_dtkvilf	-0.440400	*	Yes.  That is exactly correct.  It has been tested, and the reversion does is on the order of weeks/months.

t1_dsmckl4	-0.660800	*	TLDR; you have no arguement. You really should leave it at that. Weabs are truly disgusting.
t1_dtaer9l	-0.804700	*	There's been no evidence that the election was physically influenced. This was stated EARLY on.. over a year ago.

t1_dsfx82p	0.000000	*	Glad you found 5 lines in a 300 page doc to get excited about.   How about the part where the FBI was investigating the Trump Campaign before anyone mentioned FusionGPS?
t1_dsk70r4	0.440400	*	It'll be just like Calamity Ganon, but orange instead of magenta, and instead of roaring, it will just bellow YUUUUUGE.
t1_dsk73xx	-0.177900	*	No, he shouldn't be a straight up racist about it and also even be saying such things in the first place. It's disgraceful. It's an insult to the office of the presidency. 
t1_dsgwspm	0.000000	*	We've barely harnessed the power of the atom and the BEST we can do with it is create a world we cannot live in. Do we really deserve to get off this rock?

t1_dss4ity	-0.497800	*	If quantity is what you are worried about, the amount of illegal immigration to the Pacific NW has been far greater than legal immigration from the rest of the world in recent times. 
t1_dtg1i79	-0.815900	*	No but seriously why dont humans as a whole form a massive super country.
t1_dsv5u5t	0.284600	*	Someone built it as a death trap.  In UK law you cannot contract out of your obligation to not make a residential deathtrap.
t1_dsp21q5	0.542300	*	Facts are irrelevant and open to opinion, its 2018. In my opinion, could very well be in excess of 100,000,000. In *fact* it most certainly would be. Because I said so.
t1_dtstbwn	-0.241500	*	I meant to add, among Bedouin men the outfits seem similar (like, the full robe thing).
t1_dtwlszc	0.440400	*	Fairly sure being funded by several first world countries will do that to you.  However, genocide tends to overshadow that.

t1_dsp4xm5	-0.969000	*	What would that shockwave have looked/felt like for an average person in the US?  Like a sonic boom?  Less quiet?  Would it rattle windows 3 times?
t1_dt1wyye	0.930000	*	Sounds like communism 
t1_dteuffk	0.000000	*	To be fair, that is how we pronounce twat, but not what. What is generally pronounced as wut. 
t1_dt6ht8h	0.177900	*	I didn't say NO U. I said they aren't thinking critically. The guy didn't even make a point. If he wants to discuss something, I am more than happy to.
t1_dsi1rne	-0.865700	*	So it's okay if the federal government hands them free guns?
t1_dthf7ea	-0.705000	*	Same with democrats. It sucked all around for contemplative Americans, which appeared to be in the minority on both sides.
t1_dto5gfp	0.801600	*	Maybe EU should do the same - select what kinds of British to allow in EU based on whims of the economy or the way wind blows in politics. How would that make you feel?
t1_dsdqqca	-0.612400	*	That's unfortunately not going to be a deterrent to fanatical state funded terrorist organizations.
t1_dturaw7	0.421500	*	I could spot ships close to 20 nautical miles out with my naked eye.. I'm sure they could've set up a second feed and still captured it from a distance
t1_dtp5cnl	0.000000	*	Quite the opposite, actually. Americans tend to refer to NGOs as non profits and the rest of the world tends to refer to them as NGOs.   
t1_dslo30l	0.000000	*	It does if you're going to go on welfare in the US. Immigration should be restricted to those who can meet the requirements to support themselves without welfare.

t1_dta6jh4	0.541100	*	!jewgold for you

t1_dt9cb1c	0.542300	*	What the hell made you presume I felt otherwise? Also, if I didnt believe in human-caused climate change, you could perhaps use softer methods of persuasion.

t1_dsp1biv	0.153100	*	Did I stutter?
t1_dsm0ep7	0.000000	*	Nobody should get offended when asked what their heritage is. This has noting to do with Asians. Its in general.

t1_dtto9wq	-0.777800	*	We have mucked up delicate ecosystems and are killing off entire animal species. So, to hell with us, yes, but we are not only killing ourselves. 
t1_dszw2xy	0.757900	*	He probably just didn't imagine that a high profile person in a first world country like Canada would be assassinated like that.

t1_dtqq1wa	0.000000	*	I equate it to the same thing. Censorship is censorship regardless of how brutal the enforcement.   Nothing good can come from thought policing, you stamp out ideologies with education.

t1_dt4pfoa	0.129800	*	Yeah, but not a whole lot of Jews and Muslims went into the Americas for the specific purpose of committing genocide.  Generally I agree with your point though.
t1_dtl6ohx	0.621700	*	Not sure about the UK. Had a mate on heroin and they got him addicted to methadone which is far worse...

t1_dt0r1mm	-0.714200	*	Sentencing someone to death isn't free though. In the US for example, the trial alone can cost tax payers millions.
t1_dtvxh5i	0.000000	*	You are totally wrong, it IS controlled by the US. And TRUE, in the case of this article, it's our governor's fault.

t1_dt1b5hg	-0.935600	*	I'm pretty sure that /u/Kamdoc is a troll, but he happens to be right that the U.S. Government kills a lot of people per capita when you compare it to all other countries.

t1_dsupql5	0.884700	*	I think you're getting the phrase Romance language confused with Gary Chapman's book The Five Love Languages.
t1_dsi3sdo	0.669700	*	Because it's unreliable?
t1_dshn3fd	0.393900	*	You arent rich. Your wealth elite are robbing you blind and you get to eat the scraps off the floor.   I'm not ashamed. I just love how triggered Americans get when you hit them with facts.

t1_dtqpslq	0.757900	*	Yeah I guess my point was that it would be quite rare for an Indian with a PhD or medical degree to drive a cab in Canada. They would much rather go back to India.
t1_dtkvhr0	0.318200	*	Just so I understand, you think 10% of all aid money should go to the country you donated to?

t1_dtdtkfn	0.599400	*	It sounds like you're saying something but I don't get it. Is this some edgy Fight Club style reset? Cause that's not going to happen.

t1_dt8tgtx	0.000000	*	Worst trade deal in history. 
t1_dt0wfkf	-0.700300	*	The point is the laws are oppressive because of Islam. Do you think all 250 million Indonesians we're born wanting to follow Islam?

t1_dsvdq0w	-0.743000	*	Rabid anti-trumpsters are just as stupid as trumpsters. This thread has proven that.

t1_dtm10yv	0.796400	*	Just what happens when you try and put an authority above a nation state. Without a way to enforce your will its pointless, and no state has the power to enforce their will on a major nuclear power.

t1_dspb0eq	-0.752600	*	Yup, radii are cube root dependent for the most part. E.g 139 times the blast = a bit over 5 times the radius of destruction.
t1_dsdwo14	0.383200	*	I mean, mining bitcoin at this point is barely profitable.  I think the metaphor works.

t1_dtc62jy	0.739100	*	First, Trump doesn't give a fuck about other countries. Secondly, in the mexican constitution it states that foreign troops can not enter the country and foreigners can not have weapons.

t1_dtmeilh	-0.476700	*	who says they're from that country?  If these guys have helicopters, night vision, and machine guns, they're essentially a paramilitary force, which murder police in 3rd world countries all the time.

t1_dswnyd3	0.000000	*	Good point. I was pinning the racism on the word when in reality it was the context and not the word itself that was to blame.   Euro might even end up being the nationality of a more united Europe.

t1_dsmyjb3	0.340000	*	Many of them wear it willingly and are part of the religion by choice. This isn't Saudi Arabia where you'll get your head chopped off otherwise.

t1_dt1ik8v	0.812600	*	Theres really no substance on earth that can contain hydrogen without becoming brittle, real fast. So you can't pipe it anyhere, or store it for very long. Good luck with that
t1_dt6it6y	-0.709600	*	No, because I can publish a story that Scientists Just Discovered The First Ever Life On The Moon!, and that's clearly both fake news and also not propaganda of any kind. Just digging for views.

t1_dtqpmi1	0.655800	*	Not Japan. The upper echelons of the Japanese government, including the emperor. The Allies basically demanded that they hand themselves over to be executed for war crimes.

t1_dt96f2h	-0.051600	*	They do this because their voters are rabid partisans who will support them regardless of what they do, and the rest of the country is split between opposition and _dae both parties are the same?_

t1_dsmmw18	0.757200	*	See now this is the exact reason why people say anti-muslim protests are racist; because the sort of person who does shit like this doesn't actually care if they're muslim, they care if they're brown.

t1_dshv1vu	0.585900	*	Yeah, it was the moment I stopped respecting the Nobel awards. He got it strictly because he wasn't Bush and no other reason.

t1_dsdplkv	0.458800	*	Yup. They want the same thing and just go about it different ways. Democrats hide behind social policies that benefit the people. Republicans hide behind economic policies that benefit the people.

t1_dsoj9z8	0.401900	*	Aren't you cute. 
t1_dskhyxl	0.708900	*	Yes, that doesn't contradict my comment. That's if you do good deeds in front of people to be seen by them. As in doing it for the praise rather than to help.

t1_dtihs53	-0.362600	*	You're ungrateful then. Could have left you outside, but decided to help anyway and instead of being grateful, there's only complaining that its not enough.
t1_dthic4f	0.000000	*	Well to take a chance here, its because I have been banned by many subreddits I now enjoy.  Rightwing/= Republican. I recommend expanding your view on what is left and right.
t1_dsh1pbl	-0.025800	*	LMFAO at calling a Tim Hortons franchise a small or medium sized business. The startup cost alone on a new Tim's takes it far out of small/medium sized business.

t1_dsrc5fs	0.318200	*	Tea AND MILK, you animal.

t1_dsrxsgi	-0.356100	*	As I said before, it's a waste of time to engage people like you. Thoughtful discussion is useless on people who spend every moment of their lives avoiding critical thought.

t1_dspt30j	0.493900	*	NYC =/= NYS. I am not talking about NYC. 
t1_dsjy39u	-0.857100	*	Actually, you're completely right. She's simply too fucking unlikeable to receive fair treatment by the right-wing media, and she really only has herself to blame.

t1_dszut8z	-0.969800	*	Yo you're totally correct. The United States has so little gun crime compared to the rest of the world due to the 2nd ammendment.
t1_dsdld2m	0.492700	*	I don't understand why these rich guys don't just get on board with solar and marijuana.  There s still money to be made.

t1_dsuz3mr	0.493900	*	You ate it up. I remember you in particular were all over it and trying to slut shame everyone. Now you look dumb as rocks and are lashing out at /u/Daxoss, who did nothing wrong!

t1_dsiu287	0.000000	*	The lack of major wars between world powers is thanks to nuclear weapons.  The huge reduction in piracy, minor wars, skirmishes, etc are thanks to the US military.

t1_dsk3ugi	-0.452200	*	Look bro, it's not complicated.  A middle class immigrant will be less of an economic burden then an impoverished one.  It's just math.

t1_dsi4bh1	-0.168000	*	The absolute irony. Difference too is that Trump makes these kind of slip ups regularly. The fact that this is still brought up for Obama shows how rare it was.

t1_dsod8p5	0.296000	*	You literally insinuated a malevolent American campaign to make you look bad. Arent as obsessed blah blah. Shut up. Take your beating with a stiff upper lip, and jog on.

t1_dsx1t6f	0.051600	*	I mean, it makes a bit of sense. It's pretty hypocritical to only ask for evidence for things you don't want to be true, and accept things you like with none

t1_dtd4ku0	-0.273200	*	But having that idea in your head in the background is going to make you come across as condescending, not just patronizing.

t1_dtvh1f6	0.000000	*	Well I'm just giving you the answer to your question... their goal isn't conservation, they're paying to kill the animal, it's just that the money can be used used for conservation.

t1_dswomlm	0.187200	*	Because it is a live fetus. If you have to fall back on extreme outlier cases where the mother's life is in danger to justify abortion as a whole, it shows how weak the argument is.

t1_dt9boyq	0.000000	*	Tame that shrew.
t1_dsws6yg	0.590700	*	I didn't base it on age. If a fetus is removed straight away it doesn't have an age, does it?  How about answering my question. Are you against morning after pills?  
t1_dsh0j3m	-0.570700	*	If by that you mean MetaCanada and OGFT are both closed minded subs who are intolerant  of differing opinions, then yeh you're right.
t1_dt2nber	0.247500	*	Just as beautiful as shooting up churches or keeping your 13 children shackled inside your home. A terrorist or a criminal is just that and they don't reflect on an entire religion.

t1_dtxqa7y	0.000000	*	The TrumPutos would find a way to be OK with that, as well. And we would discover that they think traps are cute like everyone else lol.
t1_dskb2q8	0.307100	*	A hundred times this. The Queen is possibly the greatest statesperson on the planet right now. Amazing as a monarch and a political leader even if she is a figurehead.
t1_dspj91u	0.000000	*	>Doesnt matter, laws arent made to make the world better, laws are made to be respected, period  Who needs a dictator right? We can destroy the freedoms of children ourselves in a good ol democracy.

t1_dsgh4g5	-0.440400	*	It was back when women and POC knew their place and weren't asking to be treated like equals. You know, when only white men were in positions of power everywhere.

t1_dskclvv	-0.599400	*	As a Brit living in the USA, he's a joke over here too. I also wanted to move here as a child and did so as soon as I turned 18. I started missing home as soon as Trump won the Republican nomination.
t1_dsqiq5c	-0.891000	*	But my point is: Israel isnt just as bad. One side wants a genocide and it isnt the Israelis. 
t1_dt9v4d1	-0.102700	*	Somebody on Cracked pointed out that Trump is very similar to Tony Stark.

t1_dszur0j	0.812600	*	You're right in that no one wants to take to the streets. But it tends to be like a rubber band snapping. If you're the last straw, all the money in the world won't save you. 
t1_dt1g2u3	0.318200	*	This statement shows you do not really know much about China.
t1_dt735w0	0.838400	*	I'm surprised how much this sounds like the same phrase in Cantonese.

t1_dsm0xtf	0.000000	*	Theyre not asking about heritage, though. The whole point is that when it comes to Asians, they are asked where are you from as a proxy. Not sure if you are reading the comments correctly dude. 
t1_dthgh1w	-0.848100	*	If an insane racist hate-cult sends a messenger, their message should automatically not be believed.  P.S. /r/conspiracy is an insane racist hate-cult.

t1_dtabkul	-0.452200	*	That's cool, you don't need to be. You just need to acknowledge that China is at fault for holding over a hundred thousand children in re-education camps.

t1_dt2cfmm	0.318200	*	The difference is that in the United States, you're permitted to have different values without being hunted by the state. Maybe it's all well and good in Beijing, but what about Tibet?

t1_dtu7x4v	0.718400	*	No actually blind good people are always part of the problem. You have to have them for the corporation to work.

t1_dtgl2np	0.318200	*	Sec. 230 (and a few other sections of the law) have guidelines of what needs to occur for the US to lift these sanctions. So the WH saying Oh, we don't need them anymore is ridiculous.

t1_dtrkt21	0.000000	*	The irony of your stupidity never ceases to amaze.  And every other modern country actually gives out permits, Israel doesn't issue any permits to the palestinians. Hence illegal structures.

t1_dstb3qq	0.025800	*	So what is the worst that could potentially happen to trump? Is it just impeachment, or could he face jail if collusion is proved?

t1_dt4ultz	0.000000	*	Ecstacy got put into schedule 1 because of one dude (DEA head) who decided as such, despite panels of scientists saying it should be schedule 3. 
t1_dtnz6h6	-0.386900	*	The difference now is that many of their cities are rightttt within bombing distance of a good chunk of our air bases. Some of them even have nukes.

t1_dssdwey	0.000000	*	Did a quick look at it appears that the expression doesnt have a solid origin. Although it mentions the possibility of T meaning T-square which a tool used in drafting (like a straight-edge)
t1_dsph40w	0.997600	*	I use appeals to emotion when I'm light on logic too. Cheer up, those atheist meanies only make up like 1% of the population. Such persecution! muh 80% majority is under attack!

t1_dt6cvka	0.000000	*	There are a lot of firsts in this presidency! 
t1_dsuapau	0.817600	*	I'll agree with that, yeah - countries try to influence each other. However, there comes a point to where (quite like the presidential election) influence turns into something a little more dirty.
t1_dt31crs	0.000000	*	That article says 24%. So not half but thanks for teaching me something
t1_dtiyrpg	0.585900	*	We could do what we in Denmark call a: ''Tommy Kenter'' (Danish actor).   He fucked a cake... I'm brainstorming here!!

t1_dskr813	0.000000	*	So the mayor is meant to address all crime, and monitoring 400 ISIS fighters whilst central government slashes funding.  And it's his fault when he can't spin all the plates?
t1_dtvjz53	-0.509600	*	The entire EU is barely ahead of the US (half a trillion) but also has a much higher population so I'd definitely put the win in the US column.
t1_dtw0jnz	0.296000	*	For now, anyway. If he tries to start a nuclear war or refuses to step down after his term is up or impeachment... Then I know what we must do.
t1_dsp1zea	0.886000	*	Wouldnt dropping the dear leader chosen by god bullshit and just generally un-fucking the populace be a better course of action than having nukes for N Korea?
t1_dsh5gxl	0.226300	*	fact is that running it into the ground is making the real estate worthless...

t1_dsoyoip	-0.601000	*	Well it goes without saying that some Southerners will never accept an authority greater than a pedophile Senator.   But that hasn't stopped the march of progress.     
t1_dt7fg6u	-0.599400	*	Compare that to the millions of civilians the U.S has killed since the Korean war
t1_dtiwozq	0.817900	*	You know, the old fashioned way, by shrinking our military and stopping all the god damned wars we are in. Then we will have billions extra to buy or build homes for the homeless.

t1_dtgn37n	-0.821700	*	But in Bible days that was perfectly fine!  Never underestimate the hoop-jumping ability of the evangelical Right.

t1_dsk3o9q	-0.051600	*	Yeah, fuck that public opinion!  
t1_dswkn41	-0.665200	*	It's not a religious argument really. There are plenty of secular humanists who are pro-life. So you should move on from that stance.
t1_dtn6hb7	-0.624900	*	this is all very suspicious.  
t1_dshv1q0	0.585900	*	Locations are easily spoofed, and that doesn't say they're from it, just that they talk about it often (and alt-righters and trolls often have a strong Sweden fixation).

t1_dsjy7tn	0.129800	*	You are trying to argue your very stupid opinion as if it was a fact.  I'm not interested in doing that.
t1_dta05lr	0.000000	*	Lmao she is so entitled and full of herself. No one cares you teach at Georgetown. Also Georgetown isnt even A tier 1 uni.

t1_dsuovmw	-0.779900	*	Well not only are employees paid salary while they're gone, but loss of revenue is 5x-6x salary cost. So an employee earning 150k/year would lose my firm $900k over a year if they took the year off. 
t1_dtevvhn	0.000000	*	Did you know that Turkey is 90% mountainous forest?
t1_dtshurt	0.542300	*	The vast majority of the world might agree but haven't given them a seat at the table at the UN. Words < Actions. Sounds like the world agrees to that too.

t1_dtpvntz	-0.025800	*	It is not 'in the style of' the cold war, at all.   This resembles relationship between UK and Germany in the very early 19th century.   Simple major power rivalry in the face of rapid change.

t1_dttgh9s	-0.848100	*	It seems like Americans are the only ones who think they live in a great country... In Australia we call you a third world country mascarading as a first world country. Sorry if that sounds rude.

t1_dtib0om	0.000000	*	Because you've got to do something with the people already there, plus remove any equipment and stuff. Plus it not being in the US makes it a bit more expensive. 
t1_dsiyaqj	-0.917300	*	Region into glass...  China doesn't like India, but that's a tad extreme don't you think? I don't even think the average Pakistani hates India enough to try that shit.

t1_dseo2nq	0.000000	*	President can only pardon federal crimes, not state crimes.  The governor would have to issue those pardons.

t1_dtis8n6	-0.715300	*	They're on US soil, US laws apply. Non- US citizens are human people and we're a nation of laws. Pretty nativist to say they don't deserve basic rights on US soil because they aren't citizens.
t1_dsp4tre	0.717700	*	This is like the rumour that the LHC would make a black hole that swallows up the planet. 
t1_dstdgwf	0.000000	*	Interesting point. It really is one of those ultimate questions that we as a society or species will probably never have a true answer to.

t1_dto8qfh	0.000000	*	It's like when you see a sign on a hiking trail that says, Do not attempt to hug the mountain lions. Some ass wagon tried to win a Darwin Award so they had to make a sign.

t1_dt9vd86	0.000000	*	Well, biochem teaches nothing about history or human relations, you'd need to have an education in the humanities to get that.

t1_dtkd2mx	0.000000	*	Honest question: how do you actually give a mouse cancer?
t1_dshrtti	-0.086500	*	I don't think your using it correctly. Whataboutism is a way to justify a's actions because what about b's actions. It doesn't matter if they are related or not, the fallacy stands.

t1_dtnyciy	0.000000	*	A rule of thumb: Anyone who references a users post history is probably not very intelligent and shouldn't be taken seriously.

t1_dt8txsg	-0.624900	*	Has violence ever solved *anything*?   (Context, people.  I *know.*) 
t1_dt2k77i	0.000000	*	Yes. 33% is a minority.
t1_dttqnpz	-0.636100	*	Read the article you're citing. It says 25 people were killed during the protests a month ago. That has nothing to do with hijab or apostasy.
t1_dt5u4j0	0.000000	*	Mueller is a Republican.
t1_dsvheic	0.361200	*	One of the conditions of being a part of ECHR is compliance with it's decisions. Being part of it is enshrined in Russian Constitution. 
t1_dsdld2m	-0.545700	*	I don't understand why these rich guys don't just get on board with solar and marijuana.  There s still money to be made. 
t1_dtdagb2	0.128000	*	Christ, they get several locations to chose from yet they end up going to whichever's not been cleared with authorities. It's just publicity stunts, really.
t1_dt7w55r	0.226600	*	It's cause thorium reactors aren't any good and probably because there is no funding. Instead we should increase funding for fusion power, by far the best power source we could possibly create.
t1_dtetasv	0.000000	*	And [drones.] (https://www.npr.org/2017/11/15/564272346/prisons-work-to-keep-out-drug-smuggling-drones)

t1_dsxtjdx	-0.790200	*	I mean it got hit by an asteroid and life still went on. We can pollute and nuke ourselves out of existence, life will still continue. 
t1_dt9vd86	0.257200	*	Well, biochem teaches nothing about history or human relations, you'd need to have an education in the humanities to get that.

t1_dsknzh0	-0.539600	*	It is funny and telling that their defense is like oh were all thinking it, hes just not using that coded language we usually use.
t1_dtp0x8a	0.126000	*	Absolutely. My grandfather actually fought in WWI and barely survived. He wasn't about to go through that ordeal again. Lots of crazy stories of chance.
t1_dsvcluo	0.401900	*	Norway is the nation with oil wealth. USA is ranked around the OECD average, and certainly is not bad in any way regarding education, just not the best.

t1_dsuovmw	0.440400	*	Well not only are employees paid salary while they're gone, but loss of revenue is 5x-6x salary cost. So an employee earning 150k/year would lose my firm $900k over a year if they took the year off.

t1_dt2z08b	0.000000	*	Of COURSE people like that would draft the dodge. They fancy themselves too important to actually go to war.

t1_dtdszty	0.318200	*	No you misunderstand. People mostly didn't think his policies were better, he didn't have any really. But he was not a politician. That was the change.

t1_dtv732g	-0.846300	*	The US also led the liberation of Kuwait, the NATO action in Bosnia, the air war against ISIS, and countless recovery efforts in the developing world. So its a mixed bag.

t1_dt1955k	-0.795000	*	Comparing this with the 2016 US Elections makes you think if China really is that bad? A lot of republicans are also not helping the mass too much

t1_dsk7edf	0.000000	*	Well, he does have a lot of golf to catch up on, you know, since he promised he'd hardly ever play golf if elected.  Unlike that Obummer fellow - he golfed 24/7 for his whole 8 years! SAD!
t1_dtczgl5	0.679900	*	Thank you so much for linking this. Despite your political leanings, Obama held himself with so much candor. That video was hilarious.

t1_dsn19cp	-0.401900	*	They don't biologically, but Socially they do.  But as socially constructed categories, they're completely liquid. What defines one race from another varies depending who you ask,
t1_dt1x7oj	-0.240600	*	Huh? Yeah they are ignored, because we can't start digging other people out while we're busy digging to free ourselves. 
t1_dsq1y99	0.000000	*	Let's gloss over the fact that all political party leaders in Canada had similar reactions to the original story?  Because fuck trudeau amirite!
t1_dt50gpv	0.401900	*	they don't, workers in Canada aren't doing the kinds of things workers in Vietnam are.  we outsourced those jobs to Alabama and Mexico decades ago.

t1_dtnzs2s	0.493900	*	Funny how the discourse up here in Canada has changed over the past year. It used to be that China shouldn't be trusted and now it's we should make more trade partners.

t1_dti7six	0.440400	*	There are only two US manufacturers of solar panels, and their pissed about this. No one asked for that help. This is to help coal, oil, and gas. Which already get subsidies

t1_dtjfexf	0.222500	*	Well to him circumcision was a relic of the past.  Kind of in the same vein as killing heretics and stoning adulterers is to other religions.

t1_dtm8k7j	0.000000	*	The abundance of food we have actually is causing famine is the already poor countries and even in the rich west we have starving people.

t1_dsmtdqf	0.128000	*	To the best of my knowledge there are no ground based interceptors or THAAD batteries currently deployed in Hawaii. You're gonna have to pray in the name of God and AEGIS.
t1_dt2l29d	-0.599400	*	The problem is that the poll makes a false dilemma when there is not supposed to be one and that skews the poll to have a 0 percent result.
t1_dsdsj00	0.817600	*	rather them than soros 
t1_dtvz4ir	0.765000	*	You are talking to unironic communists there is no point. Prison is slavery. Not earning enough is slavery. Negotiating a wage is slavery etc
t1_dti6mzo	-0.542300	*	Btw, if you honestly believe this Russian collusion thing, then you'd take a long hard look at why the Obama admin was selling nuclear material to the boogeyman Russia. But you won't.

t1_dtqazr7	-0.296000	*	I think he might be mistaking T_D infested r/Canada for actual Canada. Since the mod team of r/Canada are all from metacanada and metacanada became a T_D infested cesspool.
t1_dsknqhp	0.000000	*	But China are communists and the rich steal their money from the poor!  Which is funny because I just described America. 
t1_dtufodv	0.636900	*	Look man... solid argument overall, but not when it applies to weed. Weed is not a fucking basic human right. Food, shelter, water.

t1_dsgxsdz	0.000000	*	That particular one actually was a pretty significant moment in our history though. A farmer cutting holes in his peach baskets so some Americans could play basketball... not so much
t1_dt3ye29	-0.296000	*	Interesting, I've heard that 666 is supposed to be 616 instead, is that true? Is this due to a historical miscalculation/mistranslation?
t1_dt2j04w	0.648600	*	When something has gone so wrong, it's hard not to talk about it.  Kinda like Hitler.

t1_dskzee4	0.421500	*	2016 had 69 billion in remittances. And saying it's American money is a bizarre way of looking at it. If I take my money and give it to Mexico that's a loss of US money...
t1_dt5fnxo	0.228000	*	None of them are academic, though, which is typically the gold standard.   The guardian is notorious for bastardizing interpretations of studies
t1_dwh8yje	-0.637800	*	It is, but they've been under sanctions for so long I don't think it'll hurt their ability to project millitary power.   Economic on the other hand, you do have a point. 
t1_dtx2z3g	-0.401900	*	No, but might make more Republicans okay with pretending to care about trans people
t1_dtrhpgk	0.000000	*	Your first sentence is irrelevant. Your second point is flat wrong and if you think the Kurd situation resembles Hong Kong I dont even know how to respond. Thats a special kind of dumb

t1_dtwvi29	-0.718400	*	Uh poop does have a strong correlation to cancer.  Inadequate fiber intake is a risk factor for colorectal cancer because your poop sits inside you for much longer than it should. 
t1_dsjk2jm	0.318200	*	To be fair, thats wrong.
t1_dtrdxno	0.815100	*	Maybe I phrased that weird.  I mean if you own a publicly traded company, you are in the 1 percent.
t1_dtjgded	0.000000	*	You show first!
t1_dsyx59i	0.153100	*	That's exactly the problem. There **isn't** a free market on healthcare in the US. If there was the prices would be as low as in other free market healthcare nations such as in India or Thailand.

t1_dsnx9h4	0.000000	*	Youre British. Maybe stick to your country?

t1_dtay89c	0.611500	*	I believe the total number of jobs is either 2 000 or 7 000 from this plant and supply chain. Bombardier Aerospace hires around 25 000 and a very large portion of that is working on the Cseries.

t1_dtoh9hs	0.000000	*	Ye just like how Hitler was against the use of poison gas in warfare, since he suffered from gas attacks himself in WWI.    He didn't object to using gas in other ways though...
t1_dt27j3f	-0.539600	*	As open as trump has been about it, any republicans who voted for him or continuing to defend or cover up for him are racists by-proxy through their silent complicity.  
t1_dt2j04w	-0.128000	*	When something has gone so wrong, it's hard not to talk about it.  Kinda like Hitler.
