t1_dtlqcr0	0	*	Portugal MP Calls for Cannabis to be Legalised, Sold at Street Value, to End Traffickers' Business. Portugals drug policy works. Every country could decriminalise heroin and should probably just legalize everything to ensure lab quality and sell in pharmacies or other specialist drug shops.. Yep. There would be far fewer overdoses if addicts could accurately dose themselves. They wouldn't have to worry about their junk being cut with fentanyl either. You're missing a big part of the problem though... People want fent and they want to push their dose to the point where they almost die. . > People want fent and they want to push their dose to the point where they almost die.  Is that a small percentage of users, or is that a stage many users tend to get to?. Neither, its a myth. . Yeah, ok. Come to Philly and tell me it's still a myth. You have no idea what you're talking about.. I absolutely do know what Im talking about. Unfortunately youre wrong bro, Im sorry you have to deal with that.

I don't know if this is part of it, but yes, China has been planting trees and plants around the Gobi Desert to stop the increasing desertification.. Ironically,  the desert helps to seed the ocean which is a greater carbon sink than the forests.. How does the desert help to seed the ocean? I'd love to read more about it.

That's the beauty of math, you can always bend it. Get yourself a fractional base and you can divide it all you want.  edit: i am an idiot.. The definition of a prime number is that you *can't* divide it in integer bases. If a prime number could be divided by integer bases then *it wouldn't be prime.*. Yeah ... I can just pick 1/2 and voila. There are suddenly no primes anymore because they're all divisible, such insight.. Sure thing, but why talk about tomatos when we are talking about bees?. Bees (although not honey bees) pollinate tomatoes. That's one reason to talk about both. :-). Yeahyeah whatever

US military arms sales is its biggest economy by far, do you really think it gives two shits about where or who the weapons go to. Well they do now when those weapons get turned on themselves. . The only solution is to sell even more arms to India. /s. Aah it is a great business model that we as Australians got suckered into as well. . Australia, I assume, is a relatively small weapons market as a consumer.. F-35 lightning 2 we have spent 100s of billions of dollars too. Abrams tank is another we should've got the leopard 2 just too name a couple. . If the Leopard2 is a better tank than the Abrams, you should let the Australian military know.

Sorry to burst your bubble but nothing will come of this, they will not get rid of the nukes it's a non starter.. Of course they won't. And they should not. Or they will end up like Iran, Iraq or Ukraine. It is their only safety of sovereignty.. What a weird commonly repeated sentiment on Reddit not every country that caves to international demands falls apart.. No it absolutely doesnt. What does fall apart are countries without means to protect themselves. NK is alone, hated and on contested land.

If they did western medias woul have put it all over the headlines considering how anti-Assad they are.

Why are heatwaves used to prove global warming exists but cold weather can't be used to say the opposite?. They're both wrong. No single climate event can be directly attributed to global warming. You have to look at the overall trend.. And the trend says the earth has been getting warmer since the end of the ice age. It's about the speed of heating. Actually, it's about providing a sense of pride and accomplishment.. It's about the bold, robust flavor of your favorite beverage!

Let's say it did happen. How does this equate with the hundreds of brutal attacks from Palestinians in the last few years including the murderof raziel shevach last week.... Deflections and whataboutism. Let me know when you can address the topic at hand. . How does punctured tires and some graffiti equal up to murdering actual people?. You can ask the empty wheelchair of Ibrahim Abu Thuraya. . Is he dead? We can't trust Hamas' word about this. Maybe they won't release photos or other evidence because he was killed by the violent mob. Trampling deaths do happen.

I don't think the people who proposed making autism a broad spectrum could have imagined the harm and resurgence of preventable diseases that would result. Weird result of doing that.. It's not exactly a result of changing the definition to a spectrum. It is, however, a result of stupid people ignoring science and doing whatever they want without regard for consequences.. That's why denying science is an impediment to any progress mankind could make.. The real impediment is people who are not intelligent enough to understand science being alive.. It's survival of the fittest. So if stupid people are surviving they must be the fittest! Brb burning my college textbooks.

That's the complete opposite of unlimited.. If you can use it no matter your data usage, thats unlimited. Throttling doesnt mean its not unlimited. Just means the speed isnt unlimited. .. Limited speed means limited amount. I'm sorry you're stupid.  PS - I can't *use* a lot of the stuff I would otherwise if I'm limited to 2G speeds..

This is bollocks, you're supposed to live on 1600 calories a day? I guess this works for anyone who doesn't actually move during the day. wtf. If you're overweight, like more than half the population there, then yeah thats a good number to shoot for.. If you're overweight you should be eating less meals, not redefining how much food is in one 'meal' lol. This is just a way for them to charge you more for less food.. Actually eating three smaller meals a day is better for weight loss than not eating . Actually that's incorrect. Eating less calories, no matter how you choose to space them out, will result in weight loss. That's just a scientific fact. >Eating less calories, no matter how you choose to space them out, will result in weight loss.   And eating smaller meals is more sustainable than skipping meals.  Try not to be so dense.. Meh, I've been doing two-meal days for the last couple years, and I'm fine. Biggest issue people have is eating more calories than they need, not how often they eat.

Russia had it's own 9/11 with the chechen wars and apartment bombings, that's the main reason putin is as strong as he is right now. Nope, Putin main points came from fixing Yeltsin mess and improving their lifes.. Putins rise to power and popularity is pretty closely binded to the apartment bombings and chechen wars.

Too much global stability and economic prosperity for this guy's liking?. There's also a lot of anti-NATO sentiment from the NATO bombings during the Yugoslavian war. Understandably, it'd be hard to trust them.. Because the Balkan States were handling things just fine before NATO.  /s. Lets not pretend NATO handled the Balkans well either.. History tells us nobody handles the Balkans well. But things aren't as bad as they could be 
t1_dswd5wo	1	*	Syria Vows To Shoot Down Turkish Jets As Erdogan Orders Putin Do Not Oppose Assault. What a bizarro world: Russia defending US allies (YPG) against a NATO member (Turkey) in Syria.   Some days, you just don't want to get out of bed.  . The USA clearly stated that Afrin is not part of YPG for them. In other words they threw then under the bus. Nice Ally, isn't it?. Considering we helped them take all of Syria east of the Euphrates from the evil terrorists in ISIS I would say we are a fantastic ally. Who  are you to think otherwise?. US aid of Rojava started after they had already thrown ISIS out of most of their territory. Bullshit.. Well said! Really debunks his statement, that retort does.. This was funny.
t1_dtblhzt	1	*	Israeli Holocaust survivors are pleading with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to cancel his plan to forcefully expel tens of thousands of African migrants, citing their own experiences as outcasts. Israel only cares about Israel. . Israel only cares about the overwhelmingly large portion of Israel that agrees with how Israeli government is operating.  . Thats.... are you criticisizing a democracy for following public opinions?. Nazi Germany was overwhelmingly in favor of Hitler's anti jew policies to. Didn't make it right. . Fair point.. Maybe democracy is overrated?. No, majority rule with no safeguards is, though.  But to call *that* democracy stretches the term to breaking point.
t1_dtcj3tc	1	*	Israeli Holocaust survivors are pleading with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to cancel his plan to forcefully expel tens of thousands of African migrants, citing their own experiences as outcasts. Not surprising. Many seekimg refuge from the Germans were turned away and sent to their deaths, including a boat of Jewish refugees that landed right here in the US.   Never again my ass.  . Shanghai offered to take an unlimited number of European Jews, but they decided they'd rather live in Germany than move to China. Bad choice.. Fleeing to another war zone doesn't seem too much better. I suppose it depended on what part of China they ended up. Remember, Japan was actively butchering China at the time. . Especially as Japan was allied with the Nazis.. The Japanese had a weird relationship with the Nazis due to the fact that both of them were fighting wars on racial grounds.  The Japanese actually shielded the Jews.. And some [Nazis actually shielded the Chinese](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rabe).  Funny how they could both see the evil in each other's actions but not their own.. Some I assume we're good people  Seriously some of the officials we're good people who did good things
t1_dtfiped	0	*	Malaysias top court said in a landmark decision Monday both parents must consent to the religious conversion of a minor, ruling unanimously in favor of a Hindu woman whose ex-husband converted their three children to Islam without telling her.. Father: I shall decide which God you believe in.  Court: No, that's for the mother to decide  -- We're all crazy. That's not what the court said - it's for both parents to agree on, not just the mother. Why does the child have no say?. When have children ever had a say in their own upbringing?. Religion should be like college, they can choose it or not at age 18.. Name me a country that does that.   . China

I don't but I'm pretty confidant both your portfolio and generosity are invented.. > I'm pretty confidant  And I'm pretty confident you don't get laid with your liberal attitude .

While the US may not have the greatest political system  in the world, China really isn't in a position to lecture ANYONE on democracy.. However they ARE in a position to lectire us on the benefits to their one party system, a benefit that is getting more and more evident with everything trump says or does . The benefits of grinding people into mush and drain the remains in the sewer and ban any acknowledgement of the event. Just 1 benefit of their one party dictatorship. You sound like a bitter ex girlfriend. China's never going to acknowledge that, so let it go . That is the dumbest argument Ive ever heard. . Well, you don't have to let it go, you could just stay a China hater forever. I guess that's what you've decided on . They crush thousands of people with tanks, and to this day they ban any mention of it. Yea I guess Im not going to just let that go.

Yes it's made through exploitation and his money was particularly bad considering his price gouging of drugs and profiting off misery .

Yeah when I read the title my first thought was holy shit, it happened again? . Canada and their damn zombies! We need a border in the north, perhaps a wall of ice.

Boo-boo, look a billionaire died. Apparently his life was way more important because he had money in the bank and bribes Trudeau every now and then..

They haven't said much, but they have said that they aren't looking for any suspects, which leads most people to believe that they think it's a murder-suicide or possibly double suicide.

If men get to stay home and have wealthy women marry them and provide money I'm sure most would be OK with it.. Ah yes, it's okay that you're treated unequally because occasionally it's comfortable discrimination.. Im just saying if you want to discriminate against men atleast give the benefits, too. Personally, no discrimination would be the ideal.. We already got our benefits, do you not understand this?

Its stupid that I have to pay a much higher tax rate than billionaires and trust fund kids who never lift a fucking finger.   The current tax code is class warfare and the middle class is losing.. Also the upper middle class and anyone making a couple hundred thousand dollars salary. Income tax really hits mid to high salary people hard. Yeah me and my wife do pretty well but after childcare,property taxes and healthcare costs solid 6 figures isnt what it used to be even in the Midwest. . Try it in NJ, it's ridiculous here.. I grew up in a modest house in central NJ.  The property taxes on the house was almost double what I pay a year to rent in VA.  I don't know how most of my friends from home that stayed manage.    . > central NJ  You know how I know you're lying?. Princeton?

They pay for A meal. I agree that it could be planned as the meat could be served separately which would please all sides. . The issue I see with that is, not all meals can have the meat separate as it's part of the dish.. Self services solve that issue generally with generally or a meat or fish option but not every school as it especially on the lower school levels.. You're really going to let children self service? . It works here in Sweden.

We would literally make a ton more food, with a lot less water, little to no pesticides, and less land. . Difficult to beat the efficiency of a field with a building attempting to recreate the conditions of a field, particularly for low value bulk crops.. Maybe you can beat the efficiency, but you can't beat the set-up cost.. It costs practically nothing to set up high tunnels and you get a partially controlled environment out of it.  Vertical farming is only feasible in specific circumstances where land is at a premium.. It costs exactly nothing to cut down trees and throw seeds on the ground. . Aight. Ill throw you out in my backyard woods naked tomorrow morning. I expect a tilled and sown field by sundown, son. And I aint paying you a goddamned cent.. What I meant is that to physically cut down trees it costs nothing. To construct a building you at least need building materials

North Korea participated in the 2014 Asian Games held in Incheon, South Korea with 150 athletes and none defected.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Asian_Games. As Olympic athletes, they are probably living in *relatively* good conditions, so the temptation is lower.. Based on Aquariums of Pyongyang, wanting to have a family to come back to is probably also a pretty strong motivator to return.. Aquariums?. Their fish are horribly underfed and they feed the families to the fish if athletes defect.. source? cos that sounds like some fake-ass bullshit to me.

[She actually already made a kill probably](http://deredactie.be/cm/vrtnieuws.english/News/1.3130686)  I'm guessing she's just testing the waters around here to see where the good eats is at.. Do wolves eat boar? The military domain has an overpopulation of them, people are encouraged to hunt them.. If it were a lone wolf versus a lone boar I'd put my money on the pig. Which is why wolves prefer group hunting.. And why most predators tend to not hunt boars very often, humans included.. Nothing one well placed shot can't solve.   And they're good eating, win/win..

After WW2 the US never policed the world. The US, just like Russia, just fucked with it.. Policing involves maintain your order of law. The Cold War and Vietnam were proxy wars for the proliferation of Capitalism (our law) over Communism.. You got this from Fox News? And since the US lost, did capitalism lose too?. No. What do you think Vietnam/Cold War was fought for?

t1_dtnhjlv	0	*	3 sanctioned Russian spy chiefs visited the US days before Trump decided against new sanctions on Russia. It is not common if they have been banned entry, however. The Russian explanation that they received a waiver on national security grounds rings true.. For them to give the Russians waivers would indicate this was a pretty important meeting. I wonder what it was about?. Them reminding Trump of his debt to the Russian Cartel and a reviewing of the pee pee tapes.(Imagine the pious rage the repubs would have if Clinton had tapes, one of their own... Gets a mulligan ). Oh Jesus do you seriously believe the peepee tape shit?. Do you seriously believe anything Trump has ever said? . No.   But the way Democrats are using russian hack as a means to downplay anyone who doesnt agree with them, makes me question what they say too.. So what is the alternative? You have 2 parties both of them are corrupted with monied interests.

And our cities are a lot safer. . I think that mostly comes down to the lack of guns, rather than the Big Brother-level surveillance.. Bit of both I'd say.

Are there any first world countries that aren't arms dealers?. Japan . Because all their gear is too small for other people. Hue hue. I'll see myself out.. I'm guessing you're 7'3, or 220 cm?. Luckily no, just 6'4.. Lol, your clothes won't fit me at all. I wore your clothes when I was 11.. Okay.
t1_dt0gec2	0	*	The German government said on Friday that it would immediately stop approving arms exports to anyone participating in the war in Yemen including Saudi Arabia, a major buyer of German weapons.. The American government has no such qualms.... Well the US is one of the countries fully supporting Saudi in the war, so does This mean Germany wont sell to the USA?. Does the US government buy weapons from Germany?  Figured if anything it would be the other way around.. Yes. The US police/military uses P228s (M11), P320s (M17), HK MP5s, HK416s, and M320 Grenade Launchers. All of these are from Germany.. All made in the USA under a legally distinct company. The USA does not need the EU. The EU needs the USA... or a lot of painted broom sticks.. . Uhh... these are all German weapons from German companies though, doesn't really matter where they are built.. Eh, they are American weapons made in America by American companies, designed by Germans and manufacuted under license from German companies.

Don't worry, Trump will take up the slack if it means making a buck. . It would be great for the economy, MIC companies create a lot of jobs in a lot of started to get support.. I know right. Who gives a shit about killing people.. They should try to limit civilian casualties, but not all in Yemen are innocent.. I said nothing about innocent.. Then I'm fine if a terrorist with a 13 year old wife dies.. And you like it when a child who who doesn't know anything about terrorism does.

In Australia, opium is considered soft diplomacy hahahahaha . What does that even mean? Its for use in the manufacture of medicine. $$$
t1_dtj12r2	0	*	Terror group leader dies after 'shooting himself in head while cleaning gun'. So he was cleaning a loaded gun while pointing it at his head?. If it was a rifle he probably had the buttstock on the ground and leaned over the barrel to wipe it down.   . 9mm. Prolly not a rifle, doncha think?. One of those 9mm assault machine bazookas . There's actually a bazooka in use today that has a 9mm rifle attached to it and it is called the Shoulder-launched Multi-purpose  *Assault* Weapon.. It's not the 9mm that makes it fit the *assault weapon* identifier.  It's the chainsaw bayonet.. Ah yes, another loyal son of the Emperor!
t1_durgaue	0	*	Italian luxury fashion brand Gucci on Friday followed a slew of US celebrities in announcing a donation of $500,000 to next month's student march on Washington demanding tougher gun controls. What is this money being used for? Marching shoes?. No shit, Occupy Wall Street had way less money than that and had an endless supply of pizza, coffee and cigarettes for a couple months.  I'd like to know more about how this money is used.. When I was in college and broke, I had an endless supply of Pizza, coffee and cigarettes. That sounds more like the occupy wall street people were buying their own food and drinks and cogarettes.. Maybe you were broke because you were always buying pizza, coffee and cigarettes U0001f914. Yes, because that is what I spent my earnings on since its the most convenient way to live when youre a student. And smoking is good procrastination when youre a student.. How is smoking good procrastination?. The more you smoke, the earlier you die, hence less time to spend procrastinating!

Well *anything* can sound bad if you phrase it like that. **anonymous individuals found to be discussing guns and political action in online chat forums, police currently do not know their identities** . Joke's on you, the police know who I am. *Suspect discussing political dissent on the deep web known to police.*. Damn you dark web/deep web.  So mysterious and criminal.

Cause if civilian firearms were banned the cops wouldn't be racist killers? What exactly does the NRA have to do with Florida cops killing a guy?. The NRA's failure to stand up for civilian firearm ownership. Their failure to stand up to the right to own a gun without being gunned down by police for it. . The NRA doesn't support illegal use of firearms. It's illegal to own a firearm if you use illegal drugs, and there was marijuana in the car. . Except there wasn't marijuana in the car. . There was.
t1_dt27fzy	0	*	The World Bank is no longer supporting the oil and gas industries.. I read the article and it sort of portrays the World Bank as some kind of a sleazy investment bank. I don't like investment banks with its ponzi scheme-ish approach on everything.. What is it you think a world bank should do if not invest in things?. The World Bank shouldn't exist in the first place for encouraging more debt through loans. It basically encourages more capitalism which is a bad thing.. Lack of access to investment funds (on non-predatory terms) is a MAJOR handicap for projects in developing economies.. I'm more in favor of governments funding other countries like the South Korean government is doing to a couple of African countries.. Maybe via some kind of organisation to facilitate international co-operation ?. Perhaps.

Holy shit, Nigeria... . It was Boko Haram at that point too. Most things are one small adjustment from being okay. If only the teachers had guns!!!! /s. Don't be sarcastic...   they probably wish they did.. Yeah, I'm just joking. You can't properly compare safety of American schools to safety of Nigerian schools in the country side. . to be fair, it's working out ok in israel. They don't arm teachers in Israel.  In fact Israel has much stricter gun control than America does.
t1_dti7t8w	1	*	Donald Trump booed in his first State of the Union after hitting out at 'chain migration'. not from the US, can a single immigrant really legally bring in their entire family? Or can they only do this when they are technically citizens? . Yes, Under current law they can bring over cousins, uncles, aunts, mother, father, brother and sisters and their kids. Its a fucking free for all.   All trump wants is it limited to spouses and kids.. It extends to cousins?  What is the justification for that?   [Edit:  Apparently the user was wrong.  Why was I downvoted for asking about it?]. no, it doesn't. Uncle's and Aunt's have kids. Their for their cousins.  So it does. . It appears you're as unfamiliar with immigration policy as you are with English grammar.  . At least my point got across. Lots of dreamers out there don't have as good as grammar as you seem to have.

The President of the United States can say it, why not a kid?.

Why do Europeans come to the US?. Because Europe was a shithole during that period? . Is it still a shithole?. Largely no, that's why wer not getting many immigrants from Europe right now. Mid-1800's? Yes.. We're not getting any immigrants from Europe wut?  Edit: Also, we has a lot of European migration in the mid 1900s.. Lol bro I never said ANY immigrants, just not many.

Yes but according to Trump they are terrible. Why send people to terrible places? . we aren't, we're stopping them from coming in the first place.

Changes nothing when its not affordable to locals.. Step 1: Buy up all the condos without foreign competition  Step 2: Wait 30 days and then sell to a foreigner  Step 3: Profit. You know the rich people are already planning to do this. . They are probably the ones that lobbied the policy, remove foreign competition and bam! profit. We're way past the time of policies being implemented in our societies that benefit anyone besides rich people. . Couldn't they have a rule where at least part of the housing has to be lived in on a regular basis or be sold? Houses shouldn't be used as bank accounts, people actually need them. Rich people would never instruct their political employees to enact rules like that.

Just from a purely logical standpoint, though, it's not a correct conclusion to draw from that particular statement.. Yes, if we limit our knowledge of the situation to that one statement, it would not be a rational conclusion to draw. .

Yeah, Im a little confused on how an election can be hacked. Did the hacker 4chan bypass the override system to hack the election mainframe?. I can see why you are confused. You think things work like in the movies.  Things are much more complicated in the real world. You will learn eventually. Just keep at it, dont give up!

In 420 cases recorded last year, witnesses gave descriptions of the alleged perpetrators. In those cases, 57 percent were described as Europeans and 25 percent as Arab or black.. > In those cases, 57 percent were described as Europeans and 25 percent as Arab or black.  1) Many muslims look european and 2) 25% seems like they are overrepresented there. there are 4 million muslims in the UK  there are 1300 incidents  the vast majority of British Muslims don't commit anti semitic hate crimes. Antisemitism is much more prevalent in Muslim communities, though. That much is just unfortunate fact.  ([Study](http://www.jpr.org.uk/publication?id=9993)). holding an opinion does not necessarily  mean someone would act on that opinion and commit a hate crime. I don't think anyone here said that. The point is, it's a cultural problem that can't be treated as a series of isolated individual events.

Cool, Im not going to take you stupid birther bait, so now were back to my original question. If the dossier is definitely fake, please provide evidence. . Provide evidence it's real and factual, the burden of proof is on you not anybody else

You say that but it did not seem to hurt the current president in office. . Not yet. So its treason then?. somagnoma, Chancellor Trumpitine is evil!. From my point of view it is the F.B.I. who are evil!
t1_dthlltp	0	*	FBI has second dossier on possible Trump-Russia collusion. Lol because the first one was so credible.... Obviously was if someone else got the same information from different sources. . Some people will believe anything as long as it fits their agenda huh?. What agenda?  You do know what a corroboration is right?. You understand that a person can repeat a lie told by another person right? Its not as if Cody Shearer has never heard of the Steele Dossier. . Except this was handed in by Steele. . Ok, so reading more about it Steele first handed this to the FBI in October. So now its even less credible because its from the same guy who brought them BS the last time.

And the Arabs were there before the Jews. And before the existence of Judaism.  . Arabs arrived in the Levant in the Seventh Century, long after the Jews, and longer after Judaism. . I'm sorry, what would you call the people living in that land before Judaism formed? . Canaanites?. Yeah, so lots of non Jewish people with a greater claim if using that as the basis.. All I did was respond to your comment, I wasnt claiming anything.

t1_dth73fd	0	*	White House to Congress: Russia sanctions not needed now. Pitch forks and torches yet? How far are we gonna let this go?. Not until the thing with Mueller finishes.. Why? At this point to not punish him is letting him explicitly ignore implementation of law. It's beyond 'I'm above the law', this is 'i am the law'. Something needs to be done. . No offense but I can't really trust people like you, too many agent provocateurs on reddit.  even if turning it violent would be a huge mistake. . Sure, a healthy level of skepticism is good. And I agree, violence isn't appropriate. Are you saying that what he's done is acceptable though? . Certainly not..

Because literally any democrat would take him over Trump any day. Hell, I would be willing to take at random, any human being in the United States over Trump. . Do these people buy the official narrative regarding 9/11 where WTC7 was left out of the official report? Or that there were WMD's in Iraq beyond what the US gave them to fight the Iranians?. O geez, another conspiracy theorist. . Adults are talking, go back to your titties.. Yeah because its very adult to push conspiracy theories about 9/11.

I bet Sweden is going to be the last country in Europe to do this, I swear these debates never go anywhere here. I would bet Finland. . I'd guess the UK. The Tories here are essentially the GOP without the evangelical nutbaggery.. Retarded comparison. The Tories are way more socially left wing. Labour's policy on drugs doesn't differ from the Tories IIRC, anyways. . Labours supporters would be heavily in favour of it though, Tory supporters think its devils lettuce.. Good ol' Beelzebub's broccoli.

I was born with sensitive teeth, and though I love cold water, when the ice touches them it hurts like hell. I can't drink from a cup with ice in it without a straw.. Ask for no ice when ordering your drink...? It'll still be cold, and you aren't going to sit there long enough for it to warm up usually. . Are you kidding? Most people sit long enough their ice melts.... I guess I eat and drink fast. I usually have a couple of drinks over the course of an hour or so of eating. . I don't think you pay attention. Cause 2 drinks in an hour is still long enough for the ice to melt.. Not really.

Every plastic straw you, and everyone else has ever used since forever still exist somewhere. Paper straws will break down. Absolutely false. . ok prove it. If even one straw ever has been recycled or burned then your statement is false. . if you are apply that sense to it then you can't ignore that mater can not be destroyed or created so why bother recycling in the first place, may statement is now correct again..

Ah yes...  Invade someone else's house and lock the home-owners in the basement or out in the street, and then complain that the neighbors neither trust nor like you.  Totally reasonable.. What a ridiculous misrepresentation of the situation. . what is the situation? Last I checked, Israel was just running into towns and tearing down Palestinian homes, or just dragging families out of their homes.. Yeah that's exactly what's going on. Good call.. well i asked you to tell me the situation, and seeing that you've not said anything on the situation and had just given my example the thumbs up, I should say you agree with my comment?  . What do you want to know? Be specific and I will try to help, I'm not going to write out 70 years of history on one of the most complex conflicts in history just to prove some guy on reddit wrong.

t1_dta3k3e	0	*	French Lawmakers Banned From Wearing Religious Symbols. As it should be. Should also include political references. . You don't see this as unfairly discriminatory against Sikhs and Muslims? . All they have to do is put aside their religious beliefs to let them fairly carry out their role as representatives of the people.  Are they able to do that?. That is an absurd expectation to place upon anyone.. We expect it of lots of public servants.  If your religious beliefs are more important than serving the people, that's okay. Fuck off out of government though.. What you are doing is spitting on the very concept of secularism. It is completely unreasonable to expect that people abandon their religious convictions in order to hold public office.. Wtf are you smoking? That view is the very epitome of secularism, hardcore secularism.

I'm going to check them off as like 80's Chess King in my head, as a reference point.
t1_du8x04l	0	*	Russia and China are developing 'destructive' space weapons, US intelligence warns. This could honestly be really scary.  Shoot even if they just shot down US satellites it can still really hurt us.. The US is plenty busy doing their own space military things. Check the Boeing X-37 out . thats a surveillance tool, mostly. It can deliver ordnance too. Minor configuration and with guys in the pentagon dreaming up nuclear hand grenades it follows that they have shit in orbit already.. carrier pidgeons can also deliver ordinance, doesn't make them weapons.. It did in WW2, and the tests were effective. Generals didn't like the idea of trusting hardware to a bird though.. i like the incendiary bats they developed to deal with Japan in WWII...

It's China, you shouldn't care.. They are the ones buying your treasury bonds, you should care.. I bet they are not buying it for one penny cheaper just because their own credit agency downgraded it.. I bet they were serious when they said they would 'reduce or stop' their buying of US bonds.. And I bet the US will have no shortage of people willing to buy their bonds.... The next chapter in the novel: When did the US empire really fall?

They'll have support from around the world in large part because of our feminists from generations past.. All waves of feminism fight real problems.. What are the problems feminists fight in the west?. For every Aziz Ansari and James Franco #MeToo goes after, theres a Harvey Weinstein and Larry Nasser. And for every Harvey Weinstein, there are a thousand innocent men having their lives ruined because of fake rape accusations. . So what is the solution there? Women can't report sexual assault because some men get falsely accused?

One severely harms a female which prevents her from feeling pleasure and the other merely makes the penis look clean. I don't see the connection. So you would be fine with cutting baby girls' labia an clitoral hoods back to make things look clean down there?. Nope, that directly harms them, I would never circumcise my kids for aesthetics alone, especially if it injures them.. Doesn't harm them any more than boys.. Depends on how its done..

What I'm getting at is if she had gone to a Muslim country where women are supposed to cover their hair, and she covered her hair, it would have gotten a negative reaction.. Probably because that kind of thing is meant to repress and restrict women. The Pope advocates for the exact opposite. . Vatican City is the only country in the world where women can neither vote nor hold any kind of executive or legislative position. Catholicism is an inherently sexist ideology, like Islam..

Haiti though actually gained its independence as a result of a slave revolt during the French Revolution.. That's actually a major reason it's so poor.

How long has it been since slavery was banned in the US and Europe?.

How is it a foreign government if they elect mps to the European parliament?. Less than 10% are British, its more than 90% foreign.. That does not mean it is a foreign government since the british have representation. . If its 90%+ foreign then it isnt British is it. If every single MEP voted for x, but every single British MEP voted against x, then the vote for x would win, even with 100% of British MEPs against it.
t1_dstsj0r	1	*	The Bayeux Tapestry is set to be displayed in Britain after French president Emmanuel Macron gave move his seal of approval: 70m-long embroidered artwork, depicts events of 11th Century leading up to Norman conquest of England, means it is to leave French shores for first time in 950 years.. Seems not worth it. It's much too valuable to be subjected to the dangers of travel.  People can visit it in person if they have to, or watch videos of it or study the image on their pc.. I think the move of the tapestry may also be symbolic of continued strong political unity between France and England. . Or it's a well timed piss take over Brexit.. Given that it shows the last time England was successfully invaded and by the French no less.. Normans are as far away from Modern France than Anglo Saxons are from modern Germans.. Tell that to the citizens of Bayeux who are upset about loaning their tapestry.  Bayeux being in Normandy by the way.. Maybe we could loan them something in return. Surely we have something in one of our museums they might want.

I wonder if solar and other renewable power options will bring them even more jobs. . Them being Indian citizens? Possibly. Probably not these particular people.

If he keeps saying it, his supporters will believe it. . Then let his supporters pay for the damn wall. . But Mexico is doing that! And their taxes are getting lower, definitely not higher like they would be if they were paying right? That's what he said, right?. He also claimed that he is a genius and that he has a perfect memory. . God dammit. He and Jong-un are made for each other. If they got married. Id be so happy. . I'm waiting for the cheesy comedy film where they fall in love

I thought you were all blacks.. Nicely done
t1_dtxh786	1	*	Group calls for free movement between Canada, U.K., Australia and New Zealand.. I was really excited for this idea....  Then I remembered Im an American. . Sorry can't let you guys back in, we like winning the commonwealth games.. Don't want back in. The thought of having a queen as some sort of revered figurehead makes me puke in my mouth a little.. A lot of Canadians don't even know she's the head of state, aside from being on some money, she isn't really involved in our lives at all.. She isnt involved in most peoples lives unless youre singing the anthem everyday or are military. In Greys words shes more like a declawed kitten compared to royals past.. She's not even in the Canadian national anthem either. That was more directly towards the UK citizens itself but youre right, she isnt that relevant.

I mean yeah, by majority, but we also have huge pacific island and indigenous populations.. Yeah but it's all relative. I had a few american friends shocked by how visibly white NZ is.

I honestly don't think so, probably thinks Canada is just the largest state or something. I bet she also thinks that Queen Elizabeth holds absolute power in the UK. Iirc she technically does but in doing so it would be the end of the monarchy . If she wants to go ahead and reverse brexit that's fine with me. She handled the BFG situation expertly I thought.

At least that's how it's going in my province. . Which province?. NB. If you want to read some *hard* propaganda check out http://forestinfo.ca/new-brunswick/vegetation-management-in-new-brunswick/.

And I have no doubt at all that the Obama years will be seen as the high point in the US' reputation abroad in the past 20 years . That doesn't mean we were popular..

Him getting mad sometimes doesn't discredit the fact that the media portrays him as angry and volatile on things that he isn't angry on. Such as, you know, this very tweet.. That's what I was saying, when you think of clips of Trump you may have seen, he certainly doesn't come across as angry or mad, despite what the media may say.. Oh, I thought you were being sarcastic.

Also, stupid people tend to have malice over those which are above them; they can't create such stuff so they want to destroy.. If you think stupidity should be a crime, you ought to start by locking yourself up.. It is. For a serious crime against Civilization like this, capital punishment is the only correct punishment..

In fairness, free movement and duty-free trade are different, both conceptually and institutionally.. They are separate, but the EU forces them together.  Thats what caused BRexit.. NO, the UK caused Brexit.

And yet we can't bring ourselves to stop using this one particular type of oil.   Our fucking species is out of its collective mind.. Its easier for the big companies to continue what theyre doing. Most of the *we* youre speaking of doesnt even know what palm oil is or what its in.. Capitalism is the most ethical means of distributing wealth:. Not everything can be blamed on capitalism.

Why do you want to watch it?  I'm honestly curious why people go out of their way to spend time watching videos of people getting being killed.. I think people are curious. Its taboo. Tons of people watch stuff like this. R/watchpeopledie have tons of viewers. The ratio of m/f is pretty close too.. I don't mean to start a petty argument here, especially since I think your answer is completely correct.  I just think it's a sign of insecure cowardice and not at all a healthy curiosity to have.. I don't think that there is anyway that you can view it that would be cowardice unless you think that the people watching these videos want to kill people, but they're too cowardly.

The wiki has a good summary on the trade page. Mercantilism is a multiplier in the trade power algorithm.   Very powerful . That would be useful if I understood said algorithm. . You don't need to know the algorithm just know that more mercantilism = more trade power = more money = more gooder.  But I also want to keep my rivals from also getting more money, doesn't more trade power in a node make them richer also?

Jono Simbolon was whipped in front of large cheering crowd, making him third non-Muslim in country to suffer public flogging.. Um...and Muslims still don't realize how this hurts their image with Non-Muslims?. What makes you think that the hardliners give a damn about that?. The hardliners in my home country seem invigorated and pleased, if anything, when they think that everybody hates us.. That's actually surprisingly similar to how Murica' rahrah nuts respond to pointing out that Trump's actions hurt American's global standing. . Nutbags come in all flavours.. Salted seems to be the most popular flavor.. You win Reddit for today.

So this is just another excuse for Reddit to shit all over America?. No, just the Trump administration. Reddit doesn't like conservatives.. i wonder why. Mostly because conservatives are typically way happier in life, liberals aren't.  Why do you think anything that goes hard-left typically starts failing afterwords?. Says the guy whos right wing ideology is responsible for basically every war and none of the progress

Millions of Islamist migrants bringing huge increases in violent and sexual crime. . I already addressed that, you must have missed it though, no worries.  >the alternative media they consume?. Rape percentage going up in Europe that's being commited by muslims is alternative media? Ok.

And the lack of chlorinated chicken, portions not designed to feed a whale, no American cheese, and no vomit-flavoured chocolate would really cause him a lot of suffering...?  .

Yes, like use energy. And build roads, keep schools running, pay policemen. You know all that shit that makes society work. Sounds energy-intensive to me.

t1_ds70u35	1	*	Flyers Stranded at Mumbai Airport as Caste Unrest Disrupts City. Why doesn't India receive outrage over its apartheid caste system?. It has officially disowned the caste system, although nobody seems to have told the general public.. Yeah. Making it illegal won't do much. Caste System is a part of the Hindu religion. It's never going away. . Yeah remember how we outlawed racial discrimination in the US and that fixed everything? s/. Yeah. Except discrimination isn't a part of any of the major US religions..... Except caste system is a cultural thing and not a religious one.  This problem plagues bit just Hinduism, but other religions too in India.. You're right.

You're in the minority.. You are a winged unicorn.  Note how our claims are backed up by the same empirical evidence.. Including your fanatical claims.. Yeah, the UK's terror problem doesn't exist....the girl from my area who had her throat slit on the bridge attack last year while on holiday, all a hoax..    nothing to see here...... What?

Support terrorists all you want, the Turks are annihilating them thankfully :-). President Gollum is the terrorist.. Sultan Gollum, thank you very much.  . Thanks for the correction. I don't want the sultan sending his janissaries after me like he did during his US visit.. Those were the *Kapkulu* , chosen from Anatolian Turks. If they were Janissaries it would be Americans or other Christian folk doing the beating on behalf of Erdoan..

I thought we didn't like foreign governments interfering in our politics?. Literally nobody has said foreign governments cant have a public stance on our internal affairs.. It is actually unusual for friendly nations to comment directly on domestic policy. Trump has constantly commented on other nations affairs. Im sure he can take it. . The point.      Your head.. Actully I dont think the PM would have made that remark if it wasnt for Trump and the fact the he is so unpopular he can score some homepoints by doing this. . Thats exactly my point. Trump is so undignified he has changed the rules.

I mean, Israel HAS offered to return them in peace deals IIRC. They were turned down. So no one but Israel even really claims them..

Bitcoin subject to manipulation by central bank of a major world power?  Who would have thought!?!. And also the 3 mining groups that have more than 50% of the hashing power. Bitcoin is not as decentralized as people think.. Nobody within the Crypto community would call Bitcoin decentralized.. That was kinda one of it's main selling points at one point.. Yes I'm not disagreeing with that. I'm just saying that it has not managed to realize its vision and has been surpassed by better coins.

t1_dtqgkwo	1	*	A chickpea shortage means hummus could get a lot more expensive. Goddamit I just turned vegan and eat hummus like every meal.. Might try making your own like us old veggie hippies from the 60s, 70s and 80s. Admit I am too lazy and thats why we buy it. But plenty of recipes out there and its easy to make. . Even if you make your own, don't you still need to use chick peas??. Itxb4s always much cheaper to make something yourself than to buy it already done, provided you have the tools for it.. Of course, but if the key ingredient becomes outrageously expensive, even making it yourself will be useless. I look to what happened with vanilla recently, as an example of this. . You're not going to save a load making your own hummus anyway. You don't have the same economies of scale that producers have so you're not going to save much once you've bought everything.. Thank you. Glad to see you agree with me. Upvoted.

Compared to other developed countries, its pretty deplorable. Compared to ethnic violence in South Sudan? Yeah, no. Peanuts.  Thats just my opinion though.

It's crazy how US just turns a blind eye on people the second they can't afford shelter.. That was exactly my point.

You mean they are shrewd investors and construct good policies. also they don't have much of a Navy/Air Force anymore so that helps, and is probably for the best. . This is entirely irrelevant.  . How much does it cost to run an army and navy? How is it irrelevant? . Because someone's deficit is another persons surplus by definition.  It really doesn't matter what you spend the money on it is absolutely impossible for everyone to have a surplus.. Not when there is growth.

No no no, we don't stack vertically anymore. Bad stuff. We stack horizontally. So first, not top.. Genau, wir lxfcgen, NICHT Stehen! (Englishman who has just learned lay and stack in his lessons). lxfcgen is to lie as in telling a fib. Fib in English has a lighthearted connotation. A white lie or harmless joke.   Lxfcgen means to deliberately falsify/fabricate. Now famously made known by the term lxfcgenpresse, fake news.

t1_dupvnoc	0	*	Germany confirms $44.9 billion surplus and GDP growth in 2017. What will Germany do with that surplus?. with that kind of revenue they could BUILD A WALLL!. we already tried that once. surprisingly, it didnt went well... . It went well for 28 years.. I saw online recently (past month or so) that the Berlin Wall has now fallen for a longer period than it ever stood. Its still falling today?! . considering that direction and movement are relative and that there is no certain up or down in the universe, it could be falling until the death of the universe
t1_dupl4wp	1	*	Germany confirms $44.9 billion surplus and GDP growth in 2017. Also achieving almost 40 percent in renewable energy in a decade is a remarkable feat. Germany is doing great things and I like it. . They use a lot of coal power plants, 40%+ of electricity comes from coal.  Renewable sources do not really replace coal but rather nuclear.. Still an impressive ramp-up.. As long as it isn't replacing coal it isn't doing anything good.   It is a travesty that they are moving away from Nuclear. . It isn't. Nuclear leaves waste that no one really knows what to do with.. Except that you can reuse at least 95% of all that waste in newer and safer reactors?   And waste isn't even a problem for Thorium reactors. . Except no one is really building those reactors. And they still leave a bunch of waste that no one knows how to deal with.
t1_duplb62	1	*	Germany confirms $44.9 billion surplus and GDP growth in 2017. Y'all got any more of that fiscal responsibility? . In America, we call that Money left on the table. Because one of the many swamp creatures would have siphoned that shit off long before it hit a budget sheet.. Funny how when you have a society that is positive about the role of government and strict laws on campaign funding that you end up with better results than in the US. . Couldn't agree more. America's largest flaw is it's us vs. them attitude when it comes to government. It is the single most contributing factor in our decline as a Nation. . I'd say it's a side effect more than the problem. The problem is our 2 party system.. Id argue the problem is neither and has to do with the fact that our politicians are bought out.. The problem is all of it. It's not a single issue, sadly.

Yes. 12 zeros. In one fucking year. . If it was to do things like infrastructure spending? I would be all for it.  But its not, its just a give away to people who already have everything. . Yeah but it'll trickle down because the rich people will want to then buy new bridges and pave major highways.  Yes it's /s, rich don't buy bridges and pave roads for the rest of us casuals.  . Mmmm, feel the trickling. Feel the warm, delicate trickling all over us plebeians.. Pretty sure that's piss.. Smells like piss
t1_dupx4nr	1	*	Germany confirms $44.9 billion surplus and GDP growth in 2017. What will Germany do with that surplus?. Build a monorail!. we allready did that 117 years ago in a german city named wuppertal. and it is upside down! :) but... nice try :D https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuppertal_Suspension_Railway. And then we did it again, this time the right way up. But it failed and we still can't get from Munich central station to the airport in 10 minutes.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transrapid. Imagine you could board the central station to directly check-in to your flight.

He wasnt covering up abuse. A Bishop was accused of covering up abuse and Pope Francis said there is no evidence he actually did that. And hes right. . > no evidence  Except the kids claiming it, right? That he was *in the room* while it happened and shit.   Just gonna casually dismiss claims from the victims like that?. That's not evidence, genius. . You may want to look up the various types of evidence.

Edit: Holy crap. I either struck a nerve or the Russians are online in full force tonight.  SAD!. Yeah but regardless a massive amount of people still voted for trump, so even if he lost the popular vote by 3 million, there's still a large problem..
