t1_duc2v38	1	*	German military short on tanks for NATO mission | The German military is under-equipped to take on its upcoming role as leader of NATO's anti-Russian defense force, a leaked document shows. Opposition politicians say the defense minister is to blame. The fact that they got to the point that they expected the U.S. to supply the tanks and personnel is to blame.. Do you have a source for that? Just curious. Because it sounds very unlikely . Yes. Germany is the deadbeat of NATO. Even Poland honors it's contractual obligation to the program more than Germany does. . Poland does because its being financed by everyone else.. While Germany is the one of the main players financing the EU programs Poland profits from.

Not this again.  That yearly report only measures the *perception* of corruption in the respective countries. Not the actual level of corruption.. So basically the way to score higher is to make better propaganda?. Well Russian propaganda and messaging campaigns are really on point but that didn't help them much on this list. Anti-Russian propaganda campaigns are on point considering that you believe Russian propaganda is on point.... >  that would be the case, then why China for example is still ranked extremely low.

Black market price markup is pretty absurd for something so easily cultivated. . Street value is highly inflated by multiple intermediaries, dangers and the simple fact that it's illegal. If it were to be legalised and industrialised, fair prices would be 20% of street prices.. I agree. Granted, quality control and quality assurance of products will drive the price back up a bit. However, street value is still an insane markup.. It's taxes that drive it up, dispensary prices are way higher than the black market in the us states that have legalized.. Source?

It's like the headlines announcing 'Trump ends International Space Station Funding in 2025!.  The station was already scheduled to close 2024. Most in the program believed it would/should stay operational until 2028. It almost certainly will be extended. There is just a process to these things.

This implies caring and cognition in the current presidential skill set. Oh he cares, he is a narcissist not dead. He cares what people say about him and he cares that other rich people like him. That's about all he cares about though.. What could possibly justify you accusing him of being a narcissist?!    [clutches pearls hard enough to cut off blood flow to brain]

That practically NEVER happens, so there's no real issue here.. My record is 9 seconds. If you put some effort into it, you can really draw out the length of the farts. Seriously? That's insane.

The temporary battery replacement thing doesn't actually solve the problem. After that program is done users are stuck again. . Well, that's just how batteries work. At some point they degrade, and Apple prevents the phone from randomly shutting down. Not sure what people want them to do about it now..

I actually agree with the backlash. The casting of a film or play should follow what the story calls for. In historical plays this it's even more important. Imagine MLK portrayed by a white guy.. So, black people shouldn't go to Ren fests, got it. . What's the connection between a festival and a play or movie?. The article doesn't mention any film or play either. Your logic is flawed. . The point holds true for this portrayal.

More like Keine Schwarzen Essen. * kein Schwarzes Essen? richtig?. Depends on what they meant. No black food or No food for blacks..

I hope you get the uneducated person you're imagining when your children are at childcare.. Most places in the US dont even require a high school degree to be a child care worker.  Its not as good as a babysitter.. You would be incredibly wrong if you assumed all or even a majority of childcare workers are like the ones you described.  Some centers you find may be glorified babysitters but many are not.. Depends on your State I guess but its not federally mandated and daycare centers use very low wage employees

Just listen to the scientists if you want to know if it is real. I don't know what you mean by, the biggest people against it are its biggest causes. You mean like the united States?.

He mentions taxidermy for like 30 seconds, and never says if it's possible or not, just that you won't look like you did in real life.. you watched it till the end tho? i find it a rather informative and good video.

Most of the polluted places I've travelled the tourists are the only ones that seem to care at all about not littering....problem is usually infrastructure . Yeah when I was in the Phillipines I was shocked to see that there's no such thing as saving garbage for bins.. In India, I cant count the amount of times I saw people sweeping litter into a pile and setting it on fire. This was full of plastic and lord knows what else.. Thats not ideal, but isn't it better than throwing it in a river?. I guess if you like hunting polar bears then sure, go ahead, burn it all!

South Africa, the nation with a history of invading them. South African has a few more more pressing things to worry about than Namibia U0001f601.

This is horrible. Rape is rape, no matter if she/he is sexually active or not.. Pretty sure that having some random shove two fingers in you under duress counts as some kind of sexual assault, too.. A standard rape kit here in the U.S. will be as or even more invasive. Granted they'll probably use a speculum and/or colposcope to take swabs and visualize any genital injury. . You have to agree there is a fundamental difference between a rape kit and testing if you are sexually active with fingers. Especially when the later is likely only used against you.. Oh the latter it's total bullshit. Just saying getting a rape kit anywhere can be a nightmare and is always invasive to some degree.

I think they're just using good coffee in Canada to compete with Timmy's. I have not.  I will when I get the chance though.
t1_dt7ndbm	1	*	Pakistan considers bringing back public executions for pedophiles.. Executions for rapists, not pedophiles.  Pedophiles are attracted to children.  Doesn't mean every single one rapes children.  . I'm ok with executing both.. Killing people for having certain kinds of thoughts is definitely worse than having those thoughts.. Killing people for pedophilia is definitely worse than pedophilia.  Cool story. Good night.. Yes it is. The majority of pedophiles do not rape children. Most child abuse happens at home by non-pedophiles. 
t1_dt7xtsv	0	*	Pakistan considers bringing back public executions for pedophiles.. Executions for rapists, not pedophiles.  Pedophiles are attracted to children.  Doesn't mean every single one rapes children.  . Agreed. Pedophilia is a sexuality and we've established you can't change that. So long as they don't act on it, I have no problem with them. . Because they're totally going to tell us when they will act on it. No problem at all. Who the fuck cares about the child victims?. Yes, by all means, let's execute people for thoughts in their head. That's the mark of a civilized world.. When did I say that?
t1_dt7lbwq	0	*	Pakistan considers bringing back public executions for pedophiles.. This is the kinda headline that just makes you shrug and go eh. Are you saying that you don't care what happens in non-Western countries?. Im saying I dont care what happens to child rapists. . The title is wrong, by the way. Pakistan is considering bringing back public executions for people who rape or kidnap children, not for pedophiles.. that's like saying 'they're not hanging murderers, they're hanging people who illegally kill people' - people who rape children _are_ pedophiles.

I'm sure today's China wouldn't mind the UK making that attempt.. With similar results, methinks.  The world has been itching for another chance to carve up that pie, once more.. Similar results to the Second Opium War?. Basically.

t1_dtbcvju	1	*	Russian trolls created Facebook events seen by more than 300,000 users: Posing as American activists, Russian government-linked trolls created 129 Facebook events between 2015 and 2017. On multiple occasions, the events prompted real Americans to take to the streets.. 300k users is a drop in the bucket though in comparison to the 300+ million. That's the average amount of followers for a B grade celebrity.... Well 300+ million arent eligible to vote and about half of those elgible vote. That 300k could had made the difference of several states. . But you're also assuming those 300k voted.. If even one third of them voted it would be enough to change some states. . 70,000 voters determined the entire election

But yet that's the situation currently, and if we don't put restrictions on pricing, it's going to continue to be the situation.
t1_dudtx00	1	*	Painkiller that once cost $138 is now $2,979. It's not just painkillers, we just paid $2500 for a medicine that my wife could die without. Hooray for American healthcare. In Germany it would be $3-5 recipe fee completely independent of how expensive the medicine is. And even that fee is capped for chronic illnesses.. In France it would be free.. In America the right to live costs money, but it's okay because we're free (to die).. It's ok another term under a torie government and the uk will probably be right the with you.

It's sad but true, so many down votes not earned.. True according to who...? The planet won't be entirely fucked or unrecognizable 50 years from now. But if we keep doing what we're doing, we will be a lot closer to sealing our own fate by that time..

Ahh, the putin bots are turning on Trump now. Russia will always attempt to weaken the US position wherever it can, there can never be a 'resest' and Trump has finally realised this. . Russia don't need to weaken the US anymore, Trump is doing a fantastic job on that. If Trump did the exact opposite of what he was doing, you'd still say he was weakening the U.S. You have zero perspective; you're a deranged person.. What perspective must you have to see that?  From the outside looking in where I have a unbiased opinion is a pretty good perspective.

Democratic process was only introduced in HK in 1995, two years before the British handover back to China. The elections have always been a farce.. You realize that means Hong Kong was democratic for more than 20 years right ? Which means an entire generation of adults grew up in a democracy. So no it was not always a farce.

I don't care if the supermarket has expenses for heating and cooling. Don't give me a cooling charge when buying milk either.. But it shows you the price, when you go to checkout it normally says the price and will say 50p surcharge, I honestly dont see why this is getting banned, if the fees were hidden sure but they are not. It's getting banned because banks and governments don't want you to use cash.

[Nah not really](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvLZxG6pB6U)
t1_dt1n2ss	1	*	Scientists Just Got Closer to Speaking Dolphin. I'd be kind of scared to hear what they're saying about us. . Don't worry. It's probably better than talking to squirrels. . Fun fact: Sqirrels have incredibly bad long-term memory. They make so many stashes for winter because they frequently forget where they are.. How good could a squirrel's memory really be?  Its brain is about the size of a kernel of corn.. About the size of a peanut. 
t1_dtnezk2	1	*	'Anti-vaxxers' often believe other conspiracy theories, a survey of more than 5,300 people in 24 countries on five continents found that people who believe in conspiracy theories are more likely to believe that vaccines aren't safe.. But anti-vaxxers seem so level-headed and logical, what with their complete disregard of scientific data and all.. The scary part is a study was done and it turns out a lot of them are well educated and out of decent universities. So this is not a lack of education issue, this is something else entirely.. Going to a university is no guarantee that you are bright or even educated beyond being able to follow instructions.    Source: I knew some real idiots in college who just got by. You what they call a doctor with a D average?  Doctor.  Let that sink in for a moment...  . Better way to phrase it is, what do you call a doctor who graduated last in their class?

Let this guy rot for life.. 8 years plus however long psychiatric therapy will take to make him safe to be around. Chances are this guy will spend the last years of his life in some institution. . Have you been watching?- the institution might just be an assignment to a somewhat distant parish.... ... the institution is a closed psychiatric hospital. It doesn't matter where it is because *he's not getting out.*. By God, thats not how we do it in America...or Ireland...or South America!
t1_dur174h	1	*	Pedophile priest convicted by German court of 108 cases of child abuse. I'm so glad I was never introduced to that environment as a kid.. The catholic church where I grew up didn't rape kids as far as I know - they just beat the shit out of them when they didn't obey.. Also less than ideal, sorry you had to go through that. Hopefully you're doing well.. Mine was pleasent. We got candy from the priest after church. He didnt rape anyone afaik. . Ours were nice as well, and surprisingly moderate. More focused on that whole compassion thing.

Allows us to choose to do wrong. God doesn't control us.. There's no loophole. There's only excuses and rationalization for heinous people.  >God doesn't control us.   yeah...no kidding.. if he molested through a hole in a sheet its ok though right? or am i getting my retarded religions mixed up?

Allows us to choose to do wrong. God doesn't control us.. But god is also omnipotent meaning that when god created this priest he already knew he would go and rape 108 children. Yet he still created him.. That would be Omnisapient, though.

Farage has never held a government position in his life so hopefully there was nothing of major importance on the USB. I guess if you dont consider the EU a government.... I guesss you have zero idea what the EU is.. How so?  It's a body of elected officials that passes legislation that is binding on others.  Sounds like a Government to me.  If it's not a government, why does it have a parliament?. It's an organisation with *certain* traits of a government.

Also the smell is much worse. . Wait, you think weed smells worse than tobacco? . Tobacco smells sweet, in my opinion.  A *bad* sweet, but still sweet.  Pot smells like rotting cabbage and skunk carcass. In my opinion.. I guess I grew up with weed in the house so maybe that's why the smell doesn't bother me. Tobacco makes me gag. I would rather breathe through a dirty sock I've worn all day than sit near a smoker.

If you have a non-smoking unit, that should extend to marijuana as well... makes sense.  But to expressly forbid the consumption of marijuana for no apparent reason seems pointlessly retarded. . this would be the correct answer. _ no it's not. Pot smoke doesn't destroy property. What about frying food or baking, or mosquito coils aka Ontario Incense ?. LOL... sure... It's not quite as bad as cigs. but it still stains everything and the smell infiltrates everything the same way cigs do.... I've tested it out and it doesn't

It's so stupid that someone like him could become president. . How about getting a hospitable planet in return? Is that a good deal? . Well he will probably just want a hospitable planet for only Americans.. He doesn't give a shit about other people, especially poor people.  By the time global warming affects weathly Americans, both him and his children will be long dead.

As someone whos been through that application process and seen the results of the process 3 times after that, I can absolutely assure you that everyone there deserves to be there.. You can't admit everyone who deserves to be there. There's not enough space for everyone. That's why these choices have to be made

It must have been like, the last university in the western world to admit more women than men.. You haven't been to a STEM college have you?. You havent been to nursing school have you? . Is the implication that because there are more girls on average in nursing schools, STEM colleges can't have more boys on average? I'm not sure I follow the logic of your statement.. Judging by your superior-than-thou attitude I'm guessing you're a STEM flunk? Or was the end of your big-fish-in-a-small-pond ride just particularly troubling?

If men get to stay home and have wealthy women marry them and provide money I'm sure most would be OK with it.. Ah yes, it's okay that you're treated unequally because occasionally it's comfortable discrimination.
t1_dt8qamp	1	*	Oxford admits more British women than men for first time in its more than 1,000-year history.. Well, obviously, for the sake of equality, we need male quotas now. . This isnt due to quotas though, this is a general trend throughout the western world, women are increasingly becoming the majority of university graduates.. How much of that is because well payed trades doesn't require an university degree and it is mostly men going for those?. It's probably mostly due to changes in education. Women get higher grades now, but they still get lower test scores. The higher grades mean they perform better at school, though.. The shift has been happening for a long time. It starts at the lowest levels of schooling where boys are disadvantaged in their education.

t1_duic1yh	1	*	Gates says billionaires should pay 'significantly' more taxes. Its stupid that I have to pay a much higher tax rate than billionaires and trust fund kids who never lift a fucking finger.   The current tax code is class warfare and the middle class is losing.. Yet Republicans got a bunch of idiots to think tax breaks for the rich is a good thing yet again.  Those supporters really love the trickle on me daddy economics.  . Have you looked at the new tax plan? I'm no Republican but it clearly lowers taxes for everyone, not just the upper class.  . What do you think is the difference between 2% for a household making 200k and 2% for a household worth 200m is? And where is the tax burden shifting when you make this cut?. I didn't say that it was fair, I just said that it also lowers taxes for the middle class....
t1_dui8wk4	1	*	Gates says billionaires should pay 'significantly' more taxes. Well the theoretical top rate is pretty much 50%. I'm not sure a higher rate than that is a fair or wise move. Check the top rate under Eisenhower.. Exactly this, our best economic years occurred when we had much much  higher taxes. Claiming that raising taxes on the super rich is bad for the economy is just ignoring all the data.. the effective tax rate (rate that was actually paid) was lower than it is now. . No, it was lower than the 90 or whatever it was but it was still high 60s-low70s.

t1_duidyj1	0	*	Gates says billionaires should pay 'significantly' more taxes. I don't get why it can't be a flat percentage. Because 15% (for sake of argument) out of the salary of someone who is barely making ends meet is so much more impactful to the taxpayer than 15% from someone making millions of dollars a year.. Why not make it 0% then?. Then the government has no money and we have no police, military, public schooling, etc.. But what about before 1917? 
t1_duimsf1	0	*	Gates says billionaires should pay 'significantly' more taxes. You know there is an option for him to pay more... Its literally right on the tax forms. . One billionaire paying more isn't the point he's making though.  He's saying that the ultra rich should be *required* to pay more.. *forced* to pay more. They use the threat of imprisonment to get them to pay. Taxation isn't voluntary. Taxation is extortion . Only if you're an idiot.  Taxation is the entry fee for functioning society..

Please tell me their is a recording of crew/command reactions as it happened.  Because that has to be the most desperately suicidal thing i could imagine.. Its the Enterprise.

t1_dtf82yl	1	*	Kurds Accuse Turks of Dropping Napalm. Fuck Turkey. Kick them out of NATO, now.. There's a fine line NATO has to walk with Turkey due to their ownership of the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits. They could get rid of its dictator at least. They've been doing it for decades so wouldn't be too hard for them.. Unfortunately it's not that easy, especially with how successful Erdogan has been in consolidating power.. Huge opposition too... 'til it got mostly sent to jail. Of course it's not like the CIA has a great history of supporting human rights or whatever abroad. They tend to favor regimes like Erdogun's.

t1_duc80ej	0	*	Irish based drugmaker has put a price tag of almost $3,000 on a bottle of two-in-one painkillers that can be bought separately for $36. if ireland is anything like USA i'm sure they did spend a ton on testing. But it begs the obvious idea: why not just buy separately?. Testing what? It's two OTC drugs. You don't think they spend tens of millions of dollars testing a single OTC drug in the US?. When they're first released, yeah. These have been on the market for decades and were already often used together. They are clearly screwing people, but there are also expenses - getting a drug through the FDA is insanely expensive.  A new perumutation of existing drugs still has to be tested.

So your only problem with the guy is he isn't good at getting the right permits?

Farmers are unlikely to kill it, they get compensated for damages anyway.. Reasonable farmers wont kill it, but there are idiots in every profession. Wolves are protected in Germany as well, but some asshole still shot the first wolf to wander through NRW. Source or stfu.

My brother and I did the Apu accent a lot growing up. We're Brit Indian. What's harmful about it? It's funny.. > We're Brit **Indian**.  Keyword here.. Yeah, no.

BMW is the biggest car exporter in the US. . Exactly! We're all in this together. VW makes a lot of their cars here. As does Audi obviously. . VW only makes the Passat and Atlas here and Audi doesn't manufacture anything in the US.. And the passat is by far their most popular car.  Your point?  Edit: Mixed up jetta and passat. . By far  Uhhhh no. Not by far. Actually, not at all.  The golf and jetta are both more popular. Assuming by that you mean what they sell the most of.

Do you really think decisions like this are black and white in terms of creating or losing jobs?. Hundreds of years of economic data shows that tariffs result in net job losses. It's a pretty black and white issue amongst economists.. No they do not.. Lol yes they do.  Example, 2002 when bush did this or literally any other tariff in modern history

Yes? The ANA is full of people who have lost loved ones to the taliban. . That's good. It would be bad if they only joined the other side when coalition forces killed their loved ones.

A fear the judge today said she did not find reasonable. And for good reason. Because it's a fucking ludicrous argument that requires inhuman levels of mental gymnastics to accept as reasonable..

If you accuse every justice system of conspiring to have you executed, I guess you're above the law and can never be held accountable for the laws you've broken.. Such an accusation would have to be credible. I'm arguing that extradition from Sweden to the US, a country that does not protect the right to life, is a credible risk.

Was the dog specifically trained to dismount an enemy machine-gun? Pretty cool if so. A successful dismounting would buy enough time to attack the nest and overwhelm it.. Don't think so, he just realized the people with the boomstick were dicks and took initiative. . Can a war dog tell the difference between a good guy with a gun and a bad guy with a gun?. Implyin there is such thing as bad and good guy in the battlefield. It is so stupid conceot only 6 year old would be that simpleminded.. The distinction between good and bad was pretty clear in WWII, when the bad guys were literally the Nazis.

Then Nasser provoked a war with Israel in 1967.. You mean Israel started a war with Egypt. . Blockading Israeli shipping was already an act of war, technically speaking.. Also Egypt mobilised first and expelled UN peacekeepers from Sinai after the USSR for some reason gave false intelligence to Syria that Israel was going to attack them...

Less than 5% of mass shooters could be diagnosed with a mental illness. . I'd say that the urge to murder strangers is a clear sign of something wrong with the brain.

More productive as well. . Maybe go look up the current state of Venezuela? . Maybe look up how much of Venezuelas economy is privatised, you might be surprised to find it is 70% private.. Maybe look up the fact that their economy started plunging downhill right after they began nationalizing many industries.

Having government agencies threaten it is not good either.... I took this as more of a 'Fix the problem or we'll regulate the shit out of it.'. I dont think thats necessarily a good approach either. It could lead to serious censorship issues and I say this as someone who despises Facebook and tried to delete it.. Yeah lol esp the Canadian government led by Trudeau... like yeah buddy I'm sure you're gonna be super fair, not just take out anything right-wing

Justin Trudeau to internet giant: censor the internet for the government or else we will... is 1984 going to actually happen?. This is nothing to do with censorship. It's to do with preventing aggressive and predatory misinformation.. Last I checked, i can do my own research into what is misinformation. I dont need my government or a company to tell me that. Thats for me to decide. This is absolutely censorship by raw definition! . Then I don't think you've read the article or understand what it is they are talking about.

As a Brit, I can tell you they're not. This small band of people should not categorise entire swathes of societies.... As someone who lives in the UK and has lots of brit friends, I can tell you they ARE. Country folk aside, the majority of people that are open brexit voters, are also Trump supporters. And as a Brit, every leave voter voter I know thinks Trump is an idiot. My anecdotal evidence thus cancels out yours.

A mayor who responds to multiple terrorist attacks by saying that it's part and parcel of living in a big city should be removed from office.. even if it was said, hes not wrong. an area with lots of people will ALWAYS be a target - terrorism will always occur regardless of who perpetrates it. So much terrorism in Tokyo.. The 1995 Sarin Subway attack injured 5,500 and killed 12. The Mitsubishi bombing in 1974 injured 207, killed 8. The Tokyo airport bombing in 1985 killed 2, injured 4.. Notice you had to go back 44 years, 33 years and 23 years to find those three incidents. Not to mention the death tolls are far lower.

If Germany fees so strongly about not killing a traitor and a terrorist, surely they wouldn't mind that terrorist being released in their country. . That's not a proper logical consequence. Jail time would make this woman unable to do harm without violating our principle to try to never kill unless *absolutely* necessary.

But at the same time made it very clear that the UK will lose some perks no matter what path they will chose.. No, we simply said it was possible. Not that we wanted it.. The UK is still a mayor economic power in the EU. Even with all this fuckery going on it would be stupid for the EU to not actually want them integrated.. About as stupid as wanting to leave it. So why do we have Brexit? Because people don't give two fuck about economy. Like I said, i'd rather have UK out so we don't have them half-in.

And it does sound like he is crazy so why not charge him as a crazy terrorist and let justice take it's course.. I dunno about Germany, but here in the states if he's male, white, and republican he will just be charged as being 'somewhat disturbed' and get a light slap on the wrist..

Does the US government buy weapons from Germany?  Figured if anything it would be the other way around.. It's not only the guns/weapons/arms itself but also parts of gunsystems like  the 120mm for the M1 Abrams made by Rheinmetall (licensed build in the USA).. Yeah but domestically built guns aren't subject to import restrictions. In fact, the US requires that all military weapons be manufactured stateside, likely for this exact type of scenario.

Palm oil as biofuel has to be the stupidest thing you could come up with if you want to save the environment.. I've heard of solutions just as bad, for example intentionally creating massive algal blooms across the ocean to reduce CO2. What's bad about lots of algae? Algae produces most of our oxygen and takes in a lot of co2. From what I remember, massive algae blooms make it impossible for other organisms to survive, so theres just this dead zone where only algae live and all the other species died or left . So if you have an oxygen-depleted dead zone already, would that be a tolerable place to start an artificial algae bloom?

I don't like investment banks with its ponzi scheme-ish approach on everything.. What is it you think a world bank should do if not invest in things?. The World Bank shouldn't exist in the first place for encouraging more debt through loans. It basically encourages more capitalism which is a bad thing.. Lack of access to investment funds (on non-predatory terms) is a MAJOR handicap for projects in developing economies.. I'm more in favor of governments funding other countries like the South Korean government is doing to a couple of African countries.

They released him on the scene after listening to him and realising their mistake. That wouldn't happen in the US.. He'd be already dead here. Yeah, but he had also been the thief .

Doesnt have anything to do with charging the policeman criminally. That may happen since IPCC have said they should face disciplinary action. Did you read the article?

Mother fuckers wanna charge me $3 to use an ATM to take money out.. can get fucked.. American here. Do they at least allow free access to your banking institutions ATMs and only charge you when using another institutions ATMs?. We do get free access to our own banks ATMs (and their subsidiaries). They only charge us for using other banks ATM's. Roughly $2.00 per transaction.. Ok, thats no different than here. How are Australian banks worse than U.S. banks?. Those fees were new, they only came into existence like 5-10 years ago.  So for us the norm is no fees.  Luckily they also basically went away this year as the banks agreed to stop doing it.

Koch Bros, Bazos, The Clintons, Murdoch, Addelson, etc. This is quite literally the pot calling the kettle black. I think you're underestimating the differences between Russia and the US. Do you think Russia would let an outside man run for office and win?. Idk, ask Bernie. You mean the canidate who expected support from the DNC but refused to fundraise for them??. Probably because the DNC funds were being funneled into the Clinton HQ like beer down a frat boy's throat 
t1_du0ufcg	1	*	Philippines to cancel $233 million helicopter deal with Canada, whose government expressed concerns they could be used to fight rebels. Duterte also directed the military not to buy arms anymore from Canada or from the United States because there is always a condition attached.. Yes that condition is you not being a bloodthirsty dictator unless you live in the Middle East in which case we'll talk but it's still just a strong maybe.. Too bad Putin has no such qualms. He'll sell child killing weapons to Assad and Iran in a heartbeat.. The same as the US does to the Sauds so..... Assad's war crimes are quite a bit worse but point taken.. That same US sold and encouraged Saddam to gas Iranian soldiers and civilians so...no qualms there either.

People should pay for their stay kids free-stuff themselves.. And if hey dont, is it cheaper for the abortion or for the kid to be on welfare and government services their entire lives?.

They can't, that's why suicide and accident rates are notably higher after the switch every year.. How are they on the switch back?. At least accidents and heart attacks are lower so in a way it evens out. Doesnt really help you if it was your dad who died in a heart attack in the spring. If were going to look at the suicide and accident rates then we have to take emotion out of it and be objective about the numbers. The total amount for the full year is what matters.

Banned as in hadnt passed any trial and is relatively early in development, or banned as in crazy Christian fundies yell about stem cells, abortion, and playing god. .

The use of critical antibiotics is being phased out however in the next 2 years.. So, what's the reason that we aren't up in arms about their use in US and EU?. I suppose cuz in India the government hasn't realised it yet or aren't taking steps.   The use is being phased out in EU and US markets. No such steps have been taken by the Indian government. . Because it's India. Anything that works in the short term is generally accepted here.

We need less military intervention from all nations, not more, if we want peaceful resolution.. The stronger the DPRK the less likely any foreign aggression against it and therefore war on the Korean peninsula. The credible threat of a nuclear counter-strike prevents aggression.

t1_dsusou8	0	*	Trump administration bars Haitians from U.S. visas for low-skilled work. Why are we bringing in low skilled workers? There are a significant number of unemployed people here in the US who don't need the competition for jobs.. Are you gonna go pick strawberries? . Pay more. Um, they aren't going to. That's the point. Then they won't get workers, and they will shut down.

Yes, so many Americans lining up to scrub toilets in hotels, tar roofs, and pick crops.. So weird. Japan has fuck all immigration and yet their country is really clean. So I guess Japanese people must be willing to do those jobs if they pay a commensurate salary..

t1_dsusdmo	1	*	Trump administration bars Haitians from U.S. visas for low-skilled work. So this would have stopped about 60 people from entering the US to work if it were enacted last year. Aren't there bigger fish to fry, Trump administration? Really?. So if it's only 60 people why is this a headline? It's only low skilled workers. They're not barring doctors or lawyers and the like.. Because liberals think it will somehow change Trump supporters minds while conservatives see it as a step against protecting their jobs. . If you're so replaceable that an unskilled worker from another country can come and replace you, that's just the free market at work.  I thought conservatives liked the free market.. Well Im not saying either group is right. I agree that conservatives can become pretty hypocritical with their views on the free market and immigration.

You're supposed to dress like that in Vatican City. Lots of women have  done it.  Edit: Downvoting me does not change Vatican City dress codes.. I know. What I'm getting at is if she had gone to a Muslim country where women are supposed to cover their hair, and she covered her hair, it would have gotten a negative reaction.. Probably because that kind of thing is meant to repress and restrict women. The Pope advocates for the exact opposite. 
t1_dt66p12	1	*	Female Journalists Blocked as Mike Pence Visits Western Wall.

No one gives a fuck what you think, you're not the president calling allies shitholes. post colonial independent nations. they fought for their countries freedom from a colonial power.... sounds familiar? . Haiti though actually gained its independence as a result of a slave revolt during the French Revolution.. That's actually a major reason it's so poor.

We're still waiting on Trump to enforce the sanctions on Russia our congress overwhelmingly passed. Hahahaha the ones that gave Exxon Mobil's former president the right to decide who can make under the table deals with Russian oligarchs for Natural Gas and Oil deals without reporting it?!  Good luck. are you saying the sanctions cause or prevent that? . I'm saying that the sanctions sound good to the public in the USA, but in practical terms don't harm anyone with US political connections.

Pump water uphill or into towers with excess power. Run them back down through a turbine to recoup most of it.. That's nice (with batteries for instantaneous power) where it's available, but it's not something you can just build wherever.. No you can't, but you can build water towers in lot of places.. Water towers for energy storage are far more expensive than grid batteries.

t1_dug8cyn	1	*	Russian curler (Alexander Krushelnitsky) fails dope test in Pyeongchang. Who cares if a curler uses meldonium? If a performance enhancing drug doesn't actually enhance your performance for your sport I don't see it as a big deal.  . Depends on what rules you agree to in advance. If you all agree that you will hold yourself to the rules, you should adhere to those rules. He agreed, but violated them anyway. . That's fair.  The point I'm trying (badly) to make is that he is going to forfeit his medal for using a performance enhancing drugs that doesn't actually enhance his performance. . He's forfeiting the medal for being a cheat. Simple as that. Why can't Russians participate without doping?. because they'd lose?

China is already a superpower. India will probably become one nearing the second half of this century. . No it isn't.  China is a regional power.. Depends on what you believe a superpower is.

t1_dt5j9er	0	*	Trudeau announces trade agreement without U.S.. Let me guess... now without all those compromises that the US insisted on.. Also without all of the economic profit.   Last I checked the USA was that syrup jockeys only customer. . Soon enough the US won't be Canada's only customer for oil. That's a much bigger deal. . And when the US begins exporting its own reserves that are infinitely larger, Canada will ask us for aid and subsidy to ease hard times.  To which we will respond with Trudeau is a Homeau. I don't think the US plans to export their reserves. Canada has some pretty big oil reserves it's looking to export, hence the pipeline to the pacific that bypasses the United States 
t1_dt5q50g	0	*	Trudeau announces trade agreement without U.S.. Let me guess... now without all those compromises that the US insisted on.. Out of the loop here... What were the compromises?. IP (Intellectual Property) provisions are suspended.  Investor-state dispute settlement was kinda dismantled.  More worker rights.  More environmental protections.. The US wanted more environmental protections? That's interesting.. No. The new TPP has more environmental protection as compromise (Canada was pushing for it).
t1_dt4v9k3	0	*	Trudeau announces trade agreement without U.S.. As far as I believe 75% of Canada's trade doesn't go through the US anymore its more like 50 or so percent..

Canadian here you can have Celine Dion at a discount forget the tarrif . as long as you take Ted Cruz
t1_dt5puyy	0	*	Trudeau announces trade agreement without U.S.. I like how the headline fails to mention it is the HATED TPP. The golden rule of reddit political theory: if Trump does something, side with the opposition.. how could you state a rule about that when there has been almost no instance where what trump is doing hasn't been objective garbage?. What kind of retarded comment is this? In a thread where a number of people have reservations about the TPP. . If you still use the word retarded, you're either a teenager or a moron. Either way, shut the fuck up.

I fail to see how advocating for more environmental protections can be considered a compromise.. Countries like Canada, New Zealand or Australia already have strong environmental protections. Other TPP countries like Vietnam or Malaysia have now to step up their game.
t1_dt5c6xa	1	*	Trudeau announces trade agreement without U.S.. I think it's long overdue that the world leaves us behind. We're not effective at leading, haven't been for almost 20 years. Obama was just really good at making us look good. We never were. . This was designed to do to white collar middle class jobs what NAFTA did to blue collar middle class jobs in the US.  If you are not a 1%-er in the US, this was a bad deal for you.. You fail to mention that in the USA, if you arent part of the top 1% everything is a bad deal.. Ummm, no.  The bottom 20% have it fucking rough. Everyone else is probably kind of ok to varying degrees. . Perhaps relatively but the closer you look the starker the picture.

ISDS is definately still in there.   Worker & enviromental rights have been watered down to appease developping countries, as have IP provisions.   So yeah you're basically right for the most part.. Yeah except there is also a provision for the US to change their mind and join in later on and all the things they wanted would just be slipped in there and forced on everyone with no choice.

t1_dt5grvv	1	*	Trudeau announces trade agreement without U.S.. I wonder why. Oh yeah. Maybe its because Trump is isolating us from the rest of the world with his insane rhetoric, constant lies, disrespect, and pulling out of the Paris Climate Agreement. Constant lies? He's made good on every campaign promise. What bullshit are you spewing. . That wall sure looks beautiful and Clinton is rotting in prison right?. Rome wasnt built in a day.

China doesn't have sovereignty over international waters. And 12 nautical miles within a country's island is not international waters, it's territorial waters..  that's correct.

But w/e, *ancient myths and stuff, man*.. If the thumbnail is what theyre talking about...it looks like a clitoris to me. My clit is truly the center of *my* universe, wish it got worshipped more often.. Tho I think it'd be more worshipped if it was easier to gain access to the inner sanctum. It's more a thing of the priest class nowadays.. You have to know the tongue in which to speak.  A careful cunning linguist. . Cunilingus what?
t1_dsf0sx7	0	*	US has to buy Russian natural gas as consumer prices soar. Not really surprising, albeit very hilarious, considering that Russian prices are much, much lower than any US alternatives. . That's what happens when you pay workers pennies on the dollar.. It's much cheaper to live in Russia. So their pennies are worth quite a bit more. . The U.S. is the largest producer of natural gas in the world, they are not importing it from Russia good ole RT.. The US isn't importing it. Companies are and they'll buy anything that is cheaper.

Millions of Germans can continue to say that W.Bush fucking sucked. Yes.. And we all see the irony in agreeing that W. Bush really wasn't so bad after all.  *edit*: Jesus guys, I seem to have forgotten how crappy Bush was?. Lots of Iraqis would probably disagree.. And more of Africans would agree.

But at least he was professional. He did the whole representational part of the presidency well.  Trump does neither.. Bush also messed up quite a bit regarding international travel and how muslims are treated and feared.
t1_du3b3zh	1	*	A South Korean actress has accused Berlin film festival organisers of hypocrisy for inviting a director who assaulted her to this year's event while promoting it as a forum to tackle abuse in the industry.. Why is it so hard to just not invite this guy?. Because the accusations apparently didn't hold up in a court . Seems they agreed he slapped her around. That's enough.. It really isn't.. Maybe it should be?
t1_dskadxq	0	*	Ecuador grants citizenship to Assange. I am curious what support Ecuador got for accepting him in the first place. As an Ecuadorian, I have no idea. Correa just decided to do it, and I don't know anyone who actually really supports having him in the embassy.. Kickbacks from Russia perhaps.. Yeah I wouldn't be surprised if there's silently a few million dollars slipped in a bank account in the cayman islands under the Ecuadorian President's name. Courtesy of his new best friend (putin). Of all the dumb conspiracy theories...

Man Europeans are so insecure about their country's status that they have to berate America every chance they get. . And yet this thread is mostly filled with Americans thumping their chest about how bad this charge is and how great the US is for it's free speech. . Damn right it is. Euros put the government above the laws. Americans put the law above the government. . Damn straight bro
t1_dv1puw7	1	*	Marine Le Pen: French far-right leader charged over Isis tweets. Regardless of how stupid the tweet was, its way more dumb to charge her for it.. European free speech law is different from America's.. Which is completely irrelevant to the point he was making.. Not really. Theyre pointing out that there is a legal basis for it, which seems relevant to me. That being said, I was confused myself as to how her actions were criminal. . There being a legal basis for it doesn't mean it isn't fucking stupid though.  His point is that it's dumb, not that the charge is or isn't legal.
t1_dv12pdk	0	*	Marine Le Pen: French far-right leader charged over Isis tweets. For anyone wondering, [here's a caption of her tweets](https://imgur.com/sP96lP3) (blurred but still NSFW). Whatever the stance on if it's right to charge her; what a piece of absolute shit she is. Holy shit.. How would you feel if a journalist publicly compared you to people who do what is shown in those images? And how would you respond?. Oh I'd be mad too - I am simply voicing that I think she is a piece of shit in general.. For any action discussed in this topic, or just because you couldnt contain sharing an irrelevant negative opinion?
t1_dv1gvrb	1	*	Marine Le Pen: French far-right leader charged over Isis tweets. I don't understand exactly what her point was (that Isis is terrible?) and with what she's being charged. . Looks like she used a deceased person and their death for her own political agenda which was opposed by the family while retweeting on official registered twitter ISIS content.. Yeah, that totally justifies arrest.. She will get no get jailed or anything... Its not the US. We dont throw people in the prison for 20 years for random reasons. . Brutal.

t1_dv1f45x	0	*	Marine Le Pen: French far-right leader charged over Isis tweets. Charged for showing people what Isis is really about. Hmm I thought journalists were supposed to do that... and not get charged. . She's charged for posting gore and without the deceased's permission. Should could have been as verbally graphic as she wanted.. So if someone posts a picture of a Holocaust victim is that a crime? Or is there some exception because of how long ago that happened? . Depends on how gory probably.  Depends on how old the picture is and if they know who it is.. So you are saying this law is extremely flexible and an ideal tool for going after the enemies of those in power?

[missing = exploding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvim4rsNHkQ)  . I had no idea that they launched so many of those things.. They've been working at this since 2013??  I don't think I ever even heard of SpaceX until like 2015. I guess I was just under a rock at the time.

If nothing else of human race survives at least an alien civilisation may one day stumble across a car in space driven by a mannequin and conclude that we were just too batshit insane to survive..

t1_dtuidpn	0	*	Elon Musk's Falcon rocket launches successfully. SpaceX's Falcon rocket  It's not like he built the whole thing himself.. thank you. labor erasure is very seriously annoying, especially considering musk isn't exactly known for treating his workers well.. Of particular note is that included in the launch was a plaque inscribed with the names of the 6,000 SpaceX staff that helped make the mission possible.. good! im glad. they really need more recognition.. Nobody's going to read the plaque. It's in space
t1_dtui33n	1	*	Elon Musk's Falcon rocket launches successfully. Absolutely awesome. And this is a guy who was working inside his garage 20 years ago. And now hes got his own car in space for the eons. Amazing . . did the car get a stable orbit? i figured it would just fall back to earth.. They send it on a Mars orbit. It will stay in space for a couple million years.. Or hopefully for a few hundred till its deorbited for traffic control saftey.. By space janitors!  Everyone should give Planetes as shot.

However the actual scenario here is that the us does it MORE, the actual whataboutism, is the article itself.. Do you have a present source showing the United States doing so more in the past two decades specifically? Thank you for providing me with one. .

This is beyond stupid. I can't even...  So do I have to tell the government whenever I start a relationship now?. If you are a known abusive that has a criminal record for either rape, murder, abuse or any other violent crimes, then yes.  If, however, you have a clean record then I imagine not, no.. Okay but how are they going to put anything together unless innocents are registering every relationship with the government to have people checked?. No idea dude, it's all backwards, in the course of protecting people from words, we are taking the world more backwards than ever before.. Protecting people from words? I don't agree with this law but it's trying to protect people from domestic violence and murder, which are a *little* more important than words.

The more democratic and western Turkey that everyone boasts about was not allowed into the EU.. Because they still had progress to make. Pre-Erdogan Turkey was worth praise because it was on the right path - nobody claimed that it was the finished article.. Turkey wasn't accepted into EU then and it's not accepted now. Greece and multiple Eastern European countries were accepted with weaker economies and higher levels of corruption. . Less authoritarian tendencies though. Greece hasnt had a coup since 75.

Macron is probably one of the most straightforward, ballsiest dudes on the good team these days. >good team  I definitely wouldn't say he's on the good team. Monarchist who still supports western imperialism. > Monarchist who still supports western imperialism  Nice hyperbole.

Hey, go ask some kids what they think of Facebook.    You know.  Just humor me.. Instagram is owned by Facebook, it's pretty much just an extension of it at this point.

Except when it's coming from the russian propaganda channel (RT).  I'm at a loss why they air that in the states.  . Because the first amendment guarantees their right to exist in the US as a TV channel. You might dislike them, which can be understandable, but banning them would be a violation of the first amendment. I never mentioned anything about banning anything.  People who run the cable rosters get to make decisions on what channels they air.

Where do you draw the line between what is tolerable and what isn't? I mean denying the Holocaust certainly should be intolerable but how can you decide what else can join the intolerable list?. That is a very good question and I have no idea how to answer it. I would say that the limit should be more closely in line with where the US has set it. Unless the speech directly incites physical violence or murder on a person or group, it should be allowed.

Theres reasonable tax avoidance strategies and theres ones that are clearly against the spirit or intent of the system and basic reasonableness.. Against the spirit isn't the same as against the law. . Thats the point. Its possible to create a convoluted legal invention that finds holes in the codes logic, but that doesnt mean its not morally wrong..

Most vegans support their children, or even encourage them if they want to eat meat. If they don't, they're just bad parents.

Haha, extra judicial killings completely outside the rule of international law are so wacky and hilarious. Lawl. . apparently some people here find extra judicial killings fine because they were bad people . Are you also still mad about the US killing bin ladin,  too?. I'd honestly rather have him brought to court. We could have learned so much. . The only thing we will learn from him is him pointing at how he got his funds and weapons from US middle east allies and that wouldn't be great especially after 9/11.

If there are Israeli terrorists planning an attack on civilians? Yes. Random Israeli citizens? No. The Israeli government does that though, and Israel is a democracy, right?

No reason for him not to be. The assassinations were carried out against terrorists and ex-Nazis, not Israeli political figures. So it's seen in a positive light in Israel.. Considering how few war criminals are actually punished, not just for WW2, but every other conflict since, I'd rather call it justice and let it go. (because the real kind isn't happening).. I mean will dick Cheney ever see prison for what he did?. No, but I don't Mossad will kill him either...

Wasn't he caught on tape ?glad he's behind bars now. oh yes, luckily he was caught. DNA100% match.  The judge ordered 4 death sentences to make sure he sets a strong example!. How do you execute him 4 times? Strap him on an electric chair, lethal injection on both arms with a bullet in the head?. If a death sentence isn't successful they will try to kill him 3 more times. Normally in the unlikely event of surviving a death sentence it is unlawful to repeat it.
t1_dufv4jm	0	*	Court in Pakistan sentences man to death for raping and murdering 7 year/old Zainab Ansari.. why is this wn? was the expectation that he would not be found guilty?. It is Islam. You never know with them.  If the girl survived, she'd probably be the one sentenced.. Actually in Islam rapists are killed. It is a lot less lenient than the hippie leftist liberal laws. . Only if they are convicted via a confession or if there are 4 male witnesses. In the absense of that, it's the woman's fault.. No these conditions are for the Islamic punishments called Hudud, if the circumstantial evidence is sufficient he will be convicted and killed through tazeer ..  nice try though.

Acid attacks can be lethal but the main purpose is to maim the person, ruining their life, their career, any relationships. It's arguably worse. It should be classified as torture from the get go. . That's a lot like ruining someone's reputation by lying about their behaviour.  The sentiment would be downvoted if I didn't make this disclaimer,  but it's a close analogy. . How is it like that?

t1_dud65f8	1	*	Dutch Parliament recognizes Armenian Genocide; Minister to Attend Commemoration.. Cenk Uygur is not going to like this one bit.. He chose a book for reading. Must be the reason why his show is called after the organization notorious for it's participation on those genocides.  Kind of like having a show called Waffen-SS but saying you are not an anti-semite. The phrase young Turks is used more generally for young people who agitate for political or other reform, or who have a rebellious disposition.. Yes, and swastikas are used in non-Nazi contexts. Not by Nazis, though, because then it's pretty much sbout Nazism. What's your point?

Well considering that Asians have been eating meat for tens of thousands years, banning them because westerners think they're cute is nothing but cultural imperialism, if you think about it.. If my cultural imperialism reduces suffering I'm alright with it.. There's no difference in suffering between the dogs in Korea and the cows, pigs, and chickens that (I assume) you eat. If you're a vegan, sorry for the false assumption.. Daily reminder that plants are also living beings, and many people are actually emotionally attached to their plants just like a pet..

Nope, but I think if you give some people money they definitely will waste it away. Yes I suppose some small % of people would just waste it away. Willing to bet most of those parents in poverty would spend it on things their kids need before getting extra crap.

Another country where blasphemy is a punishable crime.. yeah, but that's not the crime at hand... Regardless, good that these people were punished for taking justice into their own hands. Its always sad to hear of archaic laws that are still in the books.. fun fact: germany has a blasphemy law, too, which makes blasphemy punishable only if it endangers public order. let that sink in..

Counter measures for the drought should be in place by then, not to mention we're all used to living with water saving every day now.. But you don't have to. Windhoek for example has a closed system. Flush your toilet it's back in the tap by tonight.   So much they can do or could have done by now. Just incompetence. . Agreed incompetence by the DA run local government is close to being criminally negligent. Helen Zille the Premier of the Western Cape, literally just ignored warning's for years. . I mean it's really simple. Uk donates 18 million pounds to SA. Exact cost of Zuma's renovations to his private estate. How much is a desalination plant ?

What Canada should do is have stamp cards so they can cash in a free coffee after a certain number of uses.

In cooking reduction is when you boil off some water to thicken something. Like you do to chili.  In chemistry you are creating a chemical reaction.. I normally throw cornflour to make it thicker, but I guess that works too.

Probably. But not much of a harsh punishment, compared to what they're asking for the guy that broke the finger, which was my point.

But if next time you could all not put a raging fucktard in the driving seat thatd be great.. Technically a plurality of us did not vote for him.

Trump is singlehandedly destroying America while 34% of the population cheers for him. It's hilarious.. Ummm, you might want to look at reality some time.  Unemployment is at an 18 year low and the stock market is breaking records.  . The stock market is artificially conflated and serves a subset of the US population, not the economy as a whole.. The stock market serves everyone who has a retirement account. It is all invested in the stock market. 401ks, pensions, IRAs, everyone is in the stock market.

China would fuck itself by withdrawing all US Treasury Bonds. They can only do it gradually or not put new money into US Treasury Bonds, which Trump will need if he wants to finance his tax cuts.. Still, no matter how you shake it, China holds power over the United States, and there is nothing America can do about it . There is a mutual dependence between the two sides. Neither can act against the other without shooting itself in the knee.

Yeah, normally on polls you get at least a few joke answers.. AFAIK you can filter out joke responses with 'honeypot' questions, where if someone answers an hp question a certain way, their survey can't be trusted and is thrown out. But what kind of questions would those be? . like if it's a drug abuse survey, there's a question asking if you've ever used derbisol. if you have, it's thrown out.

Basically staff members trying to jerk off at work while getting paid..by tax payers.  . I missed the part about how they are trying to ban porn. It didn't say this necessarily happened at work. Maybe I missed that. . Yeah, the issue was the 24000 attempts were made on the parliament networks within the building and using government owed vpns that are strictly for business . Awesome. And I'm sure they voted for pay raises.

I visited Rome and such last year.(Belgian here)  Obviously Egypt was on my bucket list at some point.  I think I'll wait.. How was Rome?. Too many Italians.. Try too many Chinese. Visited that famous fountain, at average height could see over almost everyone, which was a plus since the whole area was packed.. It was ~~shit~~ shut when I went there  Edit: Shut not shit
t1_dsbiuz7	1	*	Egypt lawmaker moves to criminalise atheism amid moral panic. It's amazing. The whole country is torn apart by religion, yet it's definitely the fault of the non believers.. Torn apart by an Islam. You dont see criminalization of atheism so much in other parts of the world.. You realize that, while unenforceable due to the constitution, several states have laws on the books banning atheists from holding public office, right?. Good luck ever having a president that is not  Christian.. They would have said the same thing about a black president in the 1990s. Or Donald Trump.

t1_dtr8ytm	1	*	Immigrants are largely behind Canada's status as one of the best-educated countries. It's almost like Canada has extremely strict immigration requirements or something . Strict if you're uneducated, generous if you are. A country with its priorities in the right place (knowledge).. More like strict if youre poor, generous if youre wealthy.. Wealthy people come in you tax them and help your people. Pretty much any government should like this. . Moreso, tax raised from the rich newcomers can be spent on the poor newcomers. That's the idea, anyway.
t1_dtxbycn	1	*	Immigrants are largely behind Canada's status as one of the best-educated countries. If you're OK with becoming a host for another culture, immigration is great. If you want to retain your birth, or native culture, immigration is not so helpful. . Isnt Canada a mix of cultures anyway? Why would you expect the mixing to suddenly stop when its increasing everywhere else in the world?. Immigration is increasing in Bangladesh? Immigration is increasing in the Middle East? How about Russia and China?. Maybe not but their traditional culture is slowly fading away as well. So how is it really that relevant to immigration?. Your rationale is inconsistent, and indecipherable. You seem to be merely argumentative.

t1_du4e39z	0	*	Facebook tests 'downvote' button among beta users, allowing people to easily flag misleading content. Downvote Facebook by cancelling your account. Bye bye social twisters.. If I could actually delete my account, I would. Problem is that Facebook keeps all your data even when you click close account. Basically, once an account is created, it's there forever. . Nah there actually is a proper delete button, it takes around 7 days for it to be fully deleted.. And you trust Facebook to actually delete everything about you from their servers? That's a tad naive, when their revenue comes from selling your personal data.. >That's a tad naive, when their revenue comes from selling your personal data.  This is 100% bullshit.

No, actually this is good for Bitcoin.. Can you elaborate on that?. Not saying I agree, but I think their logic is that traditional markets becoming less reliable = more opportunity for newer markets like cryptocurrencies.. no its just a meme https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbZ8zDpX2Mg

I wouldnt attack you but I definitely consider you my enemy.

Yeah, you downed a drone with a helicopter I think it was. But they shot down your F16. I'm sure they would take that trade all day any day. Just too silly.     . We took down half of their anti-aircraft ammo in one night. we can settle for one F16 . That's a reassuring lie told by the IDF. . And with that username I'm sure you aren't bias   Bye, Felicia!. It's a reference to Arabs...
t1_dtmr8fq	0	*	US boy, three, 'killed over a cupcake'. Trumpastan is a brutal place.. Yeah its Trumps fault. Fucking moron gtfo. LOL! Nobody is blaming Trump.  Its a critique of American culture.

t1_dt2l6rd	1	*	Turkish border town hit by missile from Syria, one killed, 32 wounded: mayor. If you start a war, your people will get killed... That is how it is . Turkish border towns have been attacked many times even before Turkish incursions to Syria. It's the main point of such operations, to have a safe borderline. . I don't believe u. Because your media probably didn't show regular katyusha rocket attacks to Turkish border towns. Turkey has to look evil, you know. . you can post links, you know .. until then .. I call this bullshit 
t1_dv68pq9	1	*	Footage shows Israeli Border Policeman throw grenade at Palestinian couple carrying infant. Netanyahu supporters in the comment section is sickenning. Oh the title is misleading, it's a stun grenade. So the baby would be fine mentality... You guys are fucked up.. Link that comment. The title is misleading, and what the troops did is terrible. It can be both, ya know?. How is the title misleading? A stun grenade is still a grenade that can inflict terrible damage to eyes, ears and lungs.. Look at the downvotes. So much asshole here. . It's the court of public opinions. Not sure that matters. It is important to have the discourse, though.
t1_dstmrag	0	*	'It's slavery in the modern world': Foreign workers say they were hungry, abused at Toronto temple - Canada. Unacceptable. Anywhere. . No they still do it in the Middle East.. Not just the Middle East. And this story is about an Indian temple in Toronto if you hadn't noticed.. Yes I hadn't noticed. I'm saying it's still acceptable in certain parts of the world.. I'm pretty sure they were saying that it's unacceptable that this happen to anyone, not that all people and governments of the world view these things as unacceptable.

A Serbian woman by the name of Vesna Vulovi survived a 10.000 m crash in 1972. The plane was on route to Zagreb (Croatia) from Copenhagen (Denmark). . There were 27 souls on board and she was the only one who, miraculously, survived. . There is a [long](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sole_survivors_of_airline_accidents_or_incidents) list of airplane crashes with only 1 survivor.. *whoa*, that is amazing
t1_dufthz1	0	*	Passenger plane carrying at least 60 people crashes in mountainous area of central Iran. I've conditioned myself to think oh shit whenever I see the BBC breaking news thumbnail. . Which is the opposite of the conditioning I have for Fox news alerts: rolling my eyes as the next political drama or scandal unfolds.. I'm pretty sure the big red siren blaring FOX NEWS ALERT is always going off. . When you're wrong as much as they are, you gotta work overtime to prevent your brainwashed masses from figuring out what's really happening.. And it's all intentional. They're wrong so much because they want their viewers to believe an imaginary reality.
t1_dufm5zh	0	*	Passenger plane carrying at least 60 people crashes in mountainous area of central Iran. Tough aircraft sanctions is going to hit even harder in the coming years. Not fun for the Iranians. . Thankfully they've been lifted now. I think we've placed an order with Airbus for 100 or so aircraft. . I had not heard this. What kind of Airbus? 100 seems a huge amount. . 100 is an insane amount of planes to purchase at once. Well, they keep crashing them into mountains...  /s
t1_dufpppj	0	*	Passenger plane carrying at least 60 people crashes in mountainous area of central Iran. After no major air disasters in 2017 weve had two already in 2018 and its only February. . The thing with random accidents is you don't know when they occur.. So?  If Trump took credit for zero crashes in 2017 he is 100% responsible for the two so far this year.  Not sure what his problem is, but he should stop killing airline passengers.  What a dick.. So your strategy is to be just as dumb as he is. Bold move. Whoosh. 
t1_dufn69u	1	*	Passenger plane carrying at least 60 people crashes in mountainous area of central Iran. What are the odds of someone actually surviving these kind of crashes?. Extremely unlikely. If the crash doesn't kill you the exposure to the elements afterwards would probably finish the job. . How quick can a rescue team get there after knowing about the crash?. It depends on a bunch of factors. Weather, inaccessible terrain etc. So pretty much how long is a piece of string.. 20
t1_duglfrz	0	*	Passenger plane carrying at least 60 people crashes in mountainous area of central Iran. I've conditioned myself to think oh shit whenever I see the BBC breaking news thumbnail. . When BBC says breaking news, it's something worth breaking. CNN calls everything breaking news except for the news.. Not entirely true - the BBC will report on a Royal so much as sneezing as 'Breaking News'.  But still miles better.. Good heavens! Which Royal sneezed? I have not heard of this. Are they okay? . I heard Charles took a dump once

Trying to talk sense into a pug owner? Lol. Almost as bad as trying to talk sense to a pit owner.. Eh. Pits are fine. The difference between pugs and pits is that there are more pits that need love and adoption than any other dog. We need more pits owners tbh.

Actually it originated in the west, so you are wrong here.. Yeah, and the atomic bomb originated in the west aswell. Doesn't mean it's good. . It is good.

It was shot down over Ukraine by separatists using Russian anti-aircraft missiles. All 298 people on board were killed. . Oh. Lol!

Crashes have happened after landing.... My favourite must be that pilot who managed to retract the landing gear while they were standing still.

Genuine question- my post was not at all trying at all to be provocative.. *of course* it doesn't matter if they're Russian or not. It just doesn't need to be pointed out.

t1_dsx5kj9	1	*	Cape Town water supply near 'point of no return' as reservoirs run dry. That's just plain scary. Could they install a desalination plant to create more water?. After a few years and billions of dollars maybe.... Well, seems to me like it's time to get started . I think the time to do it wouldve been to start years ago... how did noone see this in advance? Some short sighted government officials in power for sure.  . Because climate change is happening faster than predicted.
t1_dswmsbj	1	*	Cape Town water supply near 'point of no return' as reservoirs run dry. That's just plain scary. Could they install a desalination plant to create more water?. it takes a tremendous amount of energy to desalinate water. And then you have to deal with gigantic amounts of leftover salt.. The leftover brine gets diluted with seawater and pumped back into the ocean.. Yeah, but if they don't do it properly at the right depth and far enough off shore, it fucks everything up.  Given what we know of South African infrastructure projects, that's a legitimate concern.

t1_dsx4glp	1	*	Cape Town water supply near 'point of no return' as reservoirs run dry. This could happen to any part of California..that's pretty scary .

And can be fully runned on Solar and Wind energy. . Nuclear plants can generate something like 100x the energy vs solar & wind using the same footprint.  It's also the safest form of energy there is and produces zero green house gasses.. Yeah, they just produce highly radioactive waste that needs to be dumped somewhere safely for the next 24.000 years, all is good. ^/s

t1_dsfetws	1	*	Trump Named The World's No. 1 Oppressor Of Press Freedom. Uh, I think Putin has him beat. . Putin doesn't lead a country that holds freedom of the press up as an ideal, Trump does. So it's a bigger deal when the American president attacks media like Trump has been doing.. To Trump's credit, though, he hasn't ordered the deaths of journalists or critics.  . Low bar.. Yes. Yes it is.

That's how you remember it.. that seems to be the way it is...  although this is really interesting.. http://thehill.com/policy/370211-gowdy-says-fbi-agents-text-messages-mention-secret-society-after-election. No, not really. A republican decided there's a secret society, and made baseless, unproven allegations about it. And dumb people lap it up & call it a conspiracy. Nothing unusual about any of it.
t1_duqwjup	1	*	Australian leader touts country's strict gun laws ahead of Trump meeting. If Americans realised that self defence is not a genuine reason for obtaining a firearms licence in Australia, their heads would explode.. the majority of the people that own guns in the us dont own them for self defense either but if you told some one that you just wanted to collect a fire arm there head would explode . Source?. am primary source. can't argue with that./s

Mind your own business is still excellent advice.. Israel should complain when Germany starts building illegal settlements in occupied Poland.. Ah, there we have it! The Jewish state is actually a new Nazi state. No anti-semitism in sight, tho. Carry on.. Hows that even antisemitism? He said Israel should complain if they build settlements in another country, which they do not.. He compared Israeli settlements in the Westbank to the Nazis occupying Poland. How the fuck is that not equating the Jewish state with the Nazis?

Actually, it's [written 1000 in English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_and_the_euro#Written_conventions_for_the_euro_in_the_languages_of_EU_member_states), or even more pedantically, 1000.00.

Most countries have similar policies. I know Canada, Aus, NZ, US and the UK do.. Again as above, consequences are for  little people. G7 countries can do whatever. If Fiji sells passports they're threatened with sanctions.

You do realize that some of the dead and trapped are from the mainland right? China wasn't even given an opportunity to save their own people. For political reasons. That is low. . China has done far worse things for political reasons, and yes I did realize this and read the whole article. . and so has everyone else. I bet you'd be shouting whataboutism if someone used your arguments on the other side. Filthy brainwashed hypocrites.

Because mass murder of civilians is always going to get rid of all the people that hate you for murdering their families and destroying their  homes..... worked in ww2. bombing the living shit out of the population into submission is how you stop public support for their cause. After Germany surrendered the US actually heavily invested in rebuilding the country. In Afghanistan we gave up on trying to improve the country but didn't give up on bombing them.. hard to help a country who wont put in the effort to be better, yet its all due to US being a giant douche since the 80s to them. Maybe we should take the hint and bring the troops home.

So, not sure why this is being said.. cos almost everyone in the US administration is a retarded hawk... i have never seen such a veritable collection of bumbling idiots in my life.. Funny because, if I recall correctly, McMaster was the one everyone was super excited about joining Trump's cabinet. . Maybe the national security advisor knows more about foreign policy than you do.

That's one way to take out a carrier group.. Or you park it off the coast of a major city and create a massive tidal wave.  . Or you let it detonate in Hudson River right inside NYC, killing hundreds of thousands and make the homes of million others inhabitable for decades with radioactive clouds of soil. . And destroy the stock market in the process. . Ehh, It's about time wall street finally got some justice. 
t1_dtsvorz	0	*	SpaceX set to fire Elon Musks Roadster into orbit on back of worlds most powerful rocket. If people start shooting their cars into space for funsies, there might be little to much accumulation of wealth.. Literally a publicity stunt. He's not doing this for funsies. He's doing it because he knows it'll get BOTH of his companies more attention in the media.   Same with those silly flamethrowers. . Thee glamthrowers raised money for a project for the company. The roadster is needed as ballast.. Yes, but they are simultaneously publicity stunts.. If developing/testing the world's most powerful heavy lift rocket is a publicity stunt, I'm good with a lot more stunts.

I was sharpening my 'Australia doesn't have a president, dickhead' pitchfork, then found your comment. Thanks bro. . We do though. The President is the guy who basically chairs the Senate. It's not a super important position and I'd have to Google it you remember who it is, but it's a thing. . No, that's the president of the Senate, we also have a president of the various courts, but those all have a qualifier in front of them; they are the president of The Senate (in Australia) or X Court..  Whole football team of Presidents really.

The twin whose older (probably by a few minutes) is going to get to say I'm a year older than you forever  U0001f602. As someone who's twin brother was born 2 hours apart on separate days, I can confirm.  I will always be a day older.. As a twin born 5 minutes before my brother I will always be 5 minutes older than him.. Depends who goes first... ;)

t1_dt9xi8w	1	*	Syria war: Germany suspends upgrade to Turkey tanks. It wouldn't surprise me to hear Erdogan announce Turkey is buying Russian tanks.  . German Tanks (Leopard is latest version) still are the best to wreck hapless human beings.. The Leopard 2 is certainly better than anything Russia exports, but a T90 might be  good enough for Turkey's purposes.  Moreover, it would also serve Erdogan's purpose of poking the West in the eye.  . German military experts say T90 is far more superior to Abrams not to mention their own Leopards. I can Google that for you if you gild me. Not to mention T90 has been tested in real combat unlike Loepard.

That still doesnt explain how *this* is structural/dramatic irony.
