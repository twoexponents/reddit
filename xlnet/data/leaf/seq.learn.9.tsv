t1_dub7ta9	0	*	German military short on tanks for NATO mission | The German military is under-equipped to take on its upcoming role as leader of NATO's anti-Russian defense force, a leaked document shows. Opposition politicians say the defense minister is to blame. To be fair, it is a tall order to match Russia on tank numbers. . Germany + 28 other countries should easily be able to counter the number/sophistication of Russian tanks . Why?. NATO has 5x the population and 20x the economic capacity of lil Russia. No, why should WE match them is my question . Deterrence? Because I don't want to fight a future war with Russia. . Ah. What is holding them up to steamrole us now?. Deterrence, sweetheart.

TI found that majority of countries in the world can be called corrupt, with a clear link between high levels of corruption and little protection of the media and civil society groups.. Begs the question: what countries are least corrupt?  Edit: read the article like I should have in the first place.. New Zealand, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Switzerland, Singapore, Sweden, Canada, Luxembourg, Netherlands.. Singapore, where the government sues politicians, detains without trial and owns the press?. Our politicians are thin skinned, but not corrupt. Isn't it just one guy running the show? . You mean LKY ? He passed away 3 years ago, his son Lee Hsien Loong is the PM now, a new PM is supposed to be picked this year. . Yeah that's the guy. Wasn't he in charge for some 30+ years? And why's his son in charge now, is Sinapore a Monarchy or something?. Benevolent dictatorship

[Corruption Perceptions Index 2017 in detail from official TI site.](https://www.transparency.org/news/feature/corruption_perceptions_index_2017). What happened in Finland? A four point drop over one year seems excessive.. Italy I get, nothing new there, but I'm slightly surprised to Spain doing so poorly. Are you serious? It's a bit of bureaucratic nightmare there. Id think it's easy to hide bribes/etc. when you're hidden behind a large and complex bureaucratic structure . 65 down to 57 is down to bureaucracy. Surely the Spanish would be entitled to think they're better than Botswana?  Might it be the impact of devolved governments and poor local oversight?. Is there anything particularly corrupt about Botswana?. They're African, obviously.  /s    . Thank you for calling out that disgusting comment.

It isn't likely that the president with the lowest approval rating in modern U.S. history will get reelected. . He matched Obama at 49% at the end of his first year, so, there's that. Really?

They control every aspect of the state and have a totalitarian regime.  For all the USA's flaws it's not remotely on the same level. If you're just gonna call everything China related BS, why even read the article or comment? I mean, it's literally just planting trees. The PLA has a track record of actually doing things like that.

And this set back vaccination efforts in that region by decades. We should never again use vaccine efforts as a cover for spying! . Or...

Most likely, the drone crashed in Iran and the regime picked up the pieces.. The thing wasnt in pieces when they showed it off, that leaves hacking as the only possible way of taking down that drone and keeping it in one piece.. I do believe this is solid evidence that you don't have a very active imagination!. The US president ask for them to give it back! why would he bother if its in pieces?!.

Why are heatwaves used to prove global warming exists but cold weather can't be used to say the opposite?. They're both wrong. No single climate event can be directly attributed to global warming. You have to look at the overall trend.. And the trend says the earth has been getting warmer since the end of the ice age. It hasn't been getting warmer this quickly until the Industrial revolution, we also understand the scientific process of how modern industry makes the earth warmer, it isn't just a guess.. Yeah but there isn't a scientific consensus on the matter. I'll wait on that.   Edit: watch this https://youtu.be/uRNO1LFQBWI. You're incorrect, the scientific consensus is that it's human caused. Hmmh I don't think so. If there is one I haven't heard about it. It matters little anyway I guess - science isn't democratic.

The thing is that it is sacred to them, though. . And if we treated that kind of thinking the way we treat flat-earthers or adults who still believe in Santa Claus, things might be easier. .

Just commenting on the editorialized headline. but it makes no difference. Why should Palestinians infiltrate a West Bank settlement whether it is occupied or not (it's not). Do you think they were there to make friends?. well they're not really infiltrating if its their own land right?. but it's not their land. also they were wearing IDF uniforms. So what do you think they were to do?. what are the occupiers in IDF uniforms there to do?. to catch terrorists like these.

Either Israel needs to absorb all the land they won in war and call it part of Israel or gtfo.   . Actually, its been illegal to acquire territory by force since just after WWII, in response to Hitlers aggressions. So Israel just needs to GTFO, and take their illegal settlers with them.. >  illegal to acquire territory by force since just after WWII  Thank you, couldn't believe the list of illegal occupations in the world. . how is an 'illegal occupation' different from a 'legal occupation'?. In a legal occupation, the occupier does not transfer its population into the occupied territory, doesnt take the territory, and is bound to protect the occupied population. Also, they leave.. 1. Israel isn't l transferring its populace.   2. There is no obligation to end the occupation until the security concerns are met.   .

Not hydrazine? That looks like hydrazine smoke to me.  Edit: Due to a post further down by /u/pepf with the rocket type(Longmarch 3B/E), it is definitely Dinitrogyn Tetroxide.. When hydrazine explodes it's yellow not orange/red . Is is actually a combination of both, the rocket booster in question uses a hypergolic mixture of Dinitrogentetraoxide and unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine..

Then you look at what expert evidence suggests, and also what happens from real-world examples tbat can be directly related, not this 'all government = bad' garbage..

t1_dsipx47	0	*	Dutch Reporters Stun Trumps Ambassador by Pressing Him to Admit He Lied About No-Go Zones. Wait people actually believe this horseshit?. Believe that no go zones exist? Yes, they do believe that, because they do exist.. Did you ever left the US?   Just curious. . I don't live in the US, genius. . Do you think that excuses your ignorance?. You're going to call me ignorant after assuming, for no reason at all, that I'm from the US?   Piss off.. I think they're calling you ignorant regardless of any assumptions.  At least that's how it kind of reads to me, anyway.. Which is ironic because A) He is being ignorant himself B) He is being ignorant in his opinion that no go zones aren't a thing. 
t1_ducv511	1	*	Justin Trudeau promises Canadian Indigenous people more rights. How's that election reform going there, Justin?. I voted for him on that promise (as well as weed and general leftness). Should have realised he wouldn't throw out the system that gave his party a majority government. . He's done pretty solid in all other areas, IMO.  Plus, were you really going to vote for the other guy?. You're right I wasn't, but it's still disappointing to see one of the big things we were promised never happen. Next time it'll be NDP.. Most likely, but the real question is will it be a majority government . Not likely.. And this is why we need election reform

I'd really like to see the US cut all fossil fuel subsidies.  Is that likely to happen anytime soon?  Not even remotely.. Not as long as world renowned lizard person, and proud destroyer of physical hearts, and owner of one that's not his own, Dick Cheney has any say in the matter.. Not as long as 90% of Americans use gas or diesel powered vehicles, either.. If I could afford to go electric, I would. Unfortunately, it's expensive and most Americans don't make nearly enough to buy in.. If electric cars got the subsidy money oil companies get, i wonder how cheap they could be.. Realistically probably not cheap enough. People dont just buy new cars on a whim, they would have to genuinly be dirt cheap to get any significant percentage of the population to buy a new car.. People buy new cars all the time. If they only bought electric cars instead it'd be problem solved.. They dont though. They buy 'new to them cars.' Its not actually that common for somebody to buy a brand new car in comparison with total drivers in the US.

Who gives a shit, fuck the climate. . I'd love to hear your thought process behind writing this comment. If there is one.. Its fairly straightforward buddy. . Fuck the climate? Not really.. Youre pretty dumb huh? . Perhaps. But care to explain 'fuck the climate' to me? Maybe I'll be less dumb.. Fuck the climate, as in I dont fucking care about climate change and everyone talking about it is wasting their time. . So you don't care about climate change, even if it is happening? Why?
t1_dshrlbb	0	*	After Trump pulls protected status for 200,000 Salvadorans, Canada says: Please dont come here. Wait a sec.... didn't Trudeau say he'd take them all?. Trudeau says a lot of things. *sigh*  I never liked him, and I knew he'd be mediocre at best. I voted for him, because I absolutely cannot stand Harper.  The choices were, Bad, and, Horrible.. Yeah, we had the same thing here. Nobody on the left will admit it though. Lots of people on the left admit that Clinton was a bad candidate.  . Well thats just cuz everyone knows she's terrible. Right, left, that's a bipartisan issue lol . I'd still take her over Trump any day of the week and twice on Sunday!. Wouldn't have mattered much honestly. You want real change in the country you need control of the legislative branch. . Supreme Court assignments are for life and outlive Presidents. 
t1_dsrzfr5	0	*	Circumcision Rates Are Slipping  Even In Israel. There is no reason why it shouldn't be a crime, sharing the same punishment as FGM.. Exactly. Once you're 18 you can cut your whole wanger off, nobody will care, but you definitely shouldn't be cutting any bits off of any children. What doctors recommend it at 18 rather than a newborn???. Doctors don't recommend circumcision to newborns. Circumcision are usually recommended when the foreskin is too tight and that is usually only observed in pre-teens or older. . Ive heard a lot of doctors recommend them.  Its also just good for the kid. How is it good?. Healthier. How is it healthier?

Lots came from Kosovo about 20 years ago. I think Poland is also sheltering plenty of people from Ukraine at the moment, though I'm not sure whether they are considered asylum seekers.. Kosovo and Ukraine are not west.. Maybe not, but theyll have more in common with the rest of Western Europe than middle easterners or North Africans. . Common interests aren't why people need to seek asylum. But common culture *is* a major factor in whether or not someone will be able to successfully integrate. . It's not about integration, it's about keeping refugees safe from persecution, torture, war. . Yeah and if they want to stay and be successful they need to integrate.

They were utopias compared to what white colonials did to them over the next few centuries.   Except maybe the Aztecs.. Somebodys been selling you a bill of goods in lieu of real history. . Not sure you're understanding me.   Pre-colonialism: Bad times, some slavery/killing, small-scale.   Colonialism: Really bad times, lots of slavery/killing, large-scale destruction of culture.. So we're better at everything, got it.. For a given definition of better.

t1_duirmyz	0	*	Gates says billionaires should pay 'significantly' more taxes. Its stupid that I have to pay a much higher tax rate than billionaires and trust fund kids who never lift a fucking finger.   The current tax code is class warfare and the middle class is losing.. Also the upper middle class and anyone making a couple hundred thousand dollars salary. Income tax really hits mid to high salary people hard. Yeah me and my wife do pretty well but after childcare,property taxes and healthcare costs solid 6 figures isnt what it used to be even in the Midwest. . Try it in NJ, it's ridiculous here.. I grew up in a modest house in central NJ.  The property taxes on the house was almost double what I pay a year to rent in VA.  I don't know how most of my friends from home that stayed manage.    . > central NJ  You know how I know you're lying?. People from that area believe in central Jersey. It's everyone else (me included) who doesn't. So what do you call the area that separates north/south jersey?

Sarkozy (ex french president) organized a war in Libya mostly to avoid having to justify its financial links with Ghaddafi. Huh no.

ITs a meaningless bullshit move existing only to antagonise and upset parents who have sent their children to French schools.  But Muslims dont integrate because Islam bad, of course.. Continuously changing existing norms to accommodate a religious minority that keeps making demands and refuses to adapt is not integration. . Keeping kosher didnt seem to matter until now.

Dont mind it- thats all I can ask. But if you tried to moderate or inhibit my behaviour or obstruct my basic needs wed have a problem.. ... Good thing I didn't do that. Of course the fact that I didn't actually means that you bringing it up is entirely irrelevant. I have to wonder why you'd bother.

t1_dtcjj5j	0	*	The Amazon rainforest is being burned down faster than ever before to plant fields of corn and soy for processed foods. They clear land for cattle and others too.. Also, soy and corn is in the majority of cow feed. Brazil produces 22% of the world's beef. It's okay though, it's not like we need forests that absorbs 20% of the worlds CO2 annually.. But let's all attack Canada's oil industry.. Just because others are doing worse deeds than Canadas oil industry doesnt mean they are not bad . They're literally a world leader for environmental standards.  Yet I see people say we should shut down our industry and just import. Like ????  The motto in Canada seems to just be #notinmybackyard.. Im sure more people want to move into cleaner energy than fossil fuels . Yet we import millions of dollars in oil a month from Saudi because pipelines are bad. You didnt read my message did you? 
t1_dtcgr2i	0	*	The Amazon rainforest is being burned down faster than ever before to plant fields of corn and soy for processed foods. Why isn't multi level farming a big thing yet? We would literally make a ton more food, with a lot less water, little to no pesticides, and less land. . Difficult to beat the efficiency of a field with a building attempting to recreate the conditions of a field, particularly for low value bulk crops.. Maybe you can beat the efficiency, but you can't beat the set-up cost.. It costs practically nothing to set up high tunnels and you get a partially controlled environment out of it.  Vertical farming is only feasible in specific circumstances where land is at a premium.. It costs exactly nothing to cut down trees and throw seeds on the ground. . They have a great growing season so it's not like they need much else.  In the US we only have year round in areas of southern CA and AZ.. >They have a great growing season so it's not like they need much else.   John has a wife and kids and a six figure income.  It's not like John needs more money...why would he try to make more money?. In that area more money is apparently better spent burning down forests than building greenhouses.

Why do you think only a country could be behind it? Why do you think it's specifically a government group and not a random person or group..

It's the one where homer has 24 hours to live because he ate bad fugu.. That's because the head chef at the Japanese restaurant was making out with Mrs. Krabbable in the back of his car, and the task was left to an amateur to cut out the deadly part of the fish..

t1_dtoz14m	0	*	BBC News: Russian fighter jet 'shot down' in Syria. How different is this really from say, a Spetsnaz soldier being killed during a raid behind enemy lines?  When the Russians venture into enemy territory they know this kind of thing is a possibility.. The actual shooting down of the jet isn't really anything major (in terms of a war). The reports of the pilot being shot while parachuting down is a pretty big thing since it's a war crime.. You're invading a country that's people have been beseeched by war and horror for decades. Do you expect them to invite him down for a cup of tea?. Nice strawman, obviously the only two options are invite down for a cup of tea and commit war crime.. Meh, it shouldn't be a war crime in the first place. I say he was fair game. Fair game to attack a surrendered soldier?. It's fair to attack someone who bombs your cities yes. Feel free to setup your own country and try and argue with the entire international consensus then.

t1_dsdgh4x	0	*	China wants an orderly exit from bitcoin mining. It's an environmental disaster, I can see why it should be regulated.. I wonder if it's more or less of an environmental disaster than physically mining gold. . Gold is at least a tangible, useful, reusable material. Crypto currency is really just arbitrary value assigned to an idea.. Why is this comment controversial? Gold is what makes your computer/smartphone run and enables you to downvote this guy's comment. Unlike Bitcoin, it has many uses aside from it's innate value.. Nope, silicon and copper are what made computer run. Gold is only used for the connector parts. . And connectors are needed to have the computer run, no?. Compare to the rest of the machine? The need for them is miniscule.  . A spoon of coffee is miniscule compared to the amount of water in a cup, but it's just a cup of hot water without it.

If the President of France is really ruling out trade with the U.S. it will be front page news here:  http://www.lemonde.fr  and then everywhere.. France cannot unilaterally say anything about trade being in the EU. They can veto any trade deal the EU makes. France saying no is the same as the EU saying no.. I thought new trade policy required unanimous eu consent.. That's the same as every country having a veto.. Exactly. Are they planning on changing trade policy with the US or keeping it the same?. There were long talks about a free trade deal between the EU and the US, however now France will (and can) block any trade deal with the US unless the US joins the Paris aggreement again.. Interesting that the eu wouldn't pressure France to go along with something that would be so beneficial for them

So the whole EU is not going to trade with the whole US over a climate treaty with no teeth? Im not going to worry yet . That is how this works, if someone doesn't agree we don't do it. And I think more countries are gonna say the same in the following week.. The UK is going to make out like a bandit if thats true . How? The EU is a much more important market than the UK; and its not like there is no trade, just no free trade deal.. They would be the middle man and trade with both . The EU and US are not gonna stop trading, this is about new trade deals that would enhance trade between the two nations.

I know, principals are something to behold right. Principals, especially for an agreement that has absolutely no enforcement written into it, doesn't feed people. . France isnt starving its a g7 nation. The people want our goods. They want Apple. They want Tesla. . Apple is made in China lol. Apple is an American company. Many of it's parts are made here in the US and sent to China for assembly. Much of that will change once Foxconn gets its factory built in Wisconsin. Edit: spelling. And they can just ship straight from China and avoid the whole problem. Or we can just force Europe to switch to Samsung. Great deal right? Lol

t1_dtn5ge5	1	*	France to Trump: No Paris Agreement, no trade agreement. That's literally what we wanted.   To the French government: go fuck yourself.  To the Parisian people: go fuck yourself.  To everyone else in France: have a wonderful day!. No it's not.   America has an import economy.   People not sending shit here means less jobs here.. The US is a consumer economy. And France is a very minor portion of said economy.. It's not just France though, you have to trade with all of the EU, not just 1 country in it. France holds veto power so it is a big deal.. And what do you think would happen if trade deals with the US fell through because France alone decided to Veto them? To put it in perspective the US is Germany's largest export market. . France has veto power for EU trade deals. You get that right? . I do. France using its veto to stop US trade deals would harm the EU far more than the US since they rely on the US more than the US does on them.. False. Europe as a whole trades just a little bit more with us than we do them.

Unless you have specific evidence that coercion was involved (you don't), it wasn't involved.. So it's not unethical for a teacher to have sex with a student in your eyes?
t1_dse67qz	0	*	Kushner Under Fire for Receiving $30M From Israeli Firm While Shaping Middle East Policy. Why is it still legal for money to be in politics? . What is the solution?.

Nor does it need to be, seeing as most people are perfectly happy eating more sustainable fish. . There's plenty of market for it in California and British Columbia.

Shit, I keep thinking he's going to die any day now, but he's 65 and could live for another 20-30 realistically.... He is ~~rich~~ (EDIT) 'Smart and Rich' enough that he could live another 100 years.  Science is doing incredible things and he is among the few on earth who can afford it all.. Lol, so was Jobs  Edit: it was a quick sarcastic reply, sorry. Also Jobs had nowhere near the resources of Putin.. Steve Jobs didn't properly treat his cancer.

Not an expert but I remember hearing that the air quality in LA was pretty damn bad.. It's actually gotten a lot better, but that's because California is a bit more progressive than many other parts of the country when it comes to environmental regulations.. That's because everything in California is a risk of cancer.. I forget who said it but my favorite quote is this products been proven to cause cancer in California? Good thing I dont live in California. I doubt it is, but does sound like a Mitch Hedberg line. lol

Those military UAVs can be set to loiter in a given area and have a pre-programmed path that they fly. They don't need a human there controlling it all the time.

Voting Anti US everytime.. From your perspective, why is North Korea suddenly interested in peace talks again?  While I dislike Trump, it appears to me that his crazy talk might have spurred interest in peace.. Kim Jong Un recently fired a successful intercontinental missile capable of carrying a nuke. He then promised to be a responsible nuclear power. He thinks he has some leverage now. . One successful missile in a non-combat setting? Given those have been around for over 50 years, I'm not sure how much leverage that really gives.. They didn't have them before, now they do.. You could say the same thing for any invention. Having a slightly large stick only buys slightly more certainty. He's still the small fish in the large pond.

Most of western Europe is democratic elected governments with popular socialist programs including universal heathcare. . It's not more capitalist than USA. No free internet, media, no free religions freedom, no guns, extreme punishment for drug use. This is not a free market.. None of those things have anything to do with capitalism.. It's a free market. Drugs is for example a product you can sell on the free market. How is that not relevant?.

t1_dt9772b	0	*	Dutch secret intelligence provided crucial intelligence about Russia's interference in US elections. It's so obvious at this point, and yet half of our country denies it without any other thought. If its so obvious why hasnt mueller proceeded with charges?  It seems half the country couldnt care less at the the actual investigation and have already convinced themselves trump colluded... You mean how his former campaign manager and former NSA director have been indicted?  It's obvious Russia interfered . No doubt Russia tried to to interfere as to the extent is unknown and the real question is if there was any collusion.  And there is nothing yet to suggest there was. Then why isn't Trump cooperating fully with the investigation?. Not cooperating??. Tried to fire Mueller.. Already discussed

Right, because having s Korea lose faith in the US so badly that they have to kiss N Koreas ass is a great thing. Its like you people dont even understand how the world works. . Not kissing NKs ass. This is a return to 1990's policies. Moon Jae In campaigned on this.. He shook hands with SK and then ranted about arms pointed at the US. This was a severely politicized move by NK. Dont be naive. . I've lived in SK for a decade and I read the news in Korean. I'm not naive. . Youre viewing this as an entirely Korean issue, which is horribly naive. . This particularly facet of the overarching dynamic IS entirely a Korean issue. I'm not saying everything about tensions on the peninsula are entirely a Korean issue, but this narrow event is..

No. Its nowhere near as black and white like that, and the only people that portray it as such are uninformed or edgelords. . It's the majority view. To think otherwise would be edgy.. Whatever helps you sleep at night bud
t1_dteg11y	1	*	Official: 95 dead, 158 wounded in Afghan attack. That is insane, all those innocent people.  Edit: I don't care what religion these people follow, the fact remains that hundreds of families are affected and lost loved ones.. no value for human life: taliban. Yeah, but we value life so much in all these collateral damages.. Yeah were as bad as the Taliban, good point.. Don't be intentionally dense.  Edit: I'm aware he's being sarcastic. The person he replied to never said the US was just as bad as the taliban. . He's not being dense. The guy he replied to is implying we aren't different than the taliban.. No, what he said was that we don't value the lives of civilians killed from collateral damage. Which is true. How many thousands of civilians did we kill last year alone? . And what should we do differently to show that we value those lives?

Turns out the sympathy was unwarranted, and probably should be quietly retracted, but that's a pretty far cry from tweeting the fake news itself.. Why should it be quietly retracted?. Because it's not a big deal, and should be treated accordingly.. He made it a huge deal, yelling from the rooftops about this lie, so his retraction should reach just as many ears.

Generation x sees Facebook as an outdated social media platform that their parents use so I dont believe it will be around as long as people assume. . You're confusing millenials for Gen Xers.  Facebook was created when Gen Xers were in their 30s. . You're confusing millenials with Gen Z  Facebook is used by people in their 20s.. Seems like 30+ to me. . Early 20s here. EVERYONE in my social circle, close and extended, use it. I'm Australian, for context.. Also early 20s Australian and everyone uses it.

t1_dtz22p6	0	*	Justin Trudeau to Facebook: Fix your fake news problem  or else. Doesnt Reddit post a bunch of bullshit news? Reddit always slams social media but it is social media. . Reddits humility is trending downwards and has been for years. It's salvageable but I'm not sure how. More comments like this might help. Getting rid of karma entirely would be a good start. It's needed for spammers and for people who treat reddit like a literal game. Unfortunately the admins don't care. They support it even. . What do you do instead of karma though...?. Still have the same ranking algorithm and upvote down voted system, just don't track the sums on user accounts.. Then you'd get third party sites tracking it. Then hide the scores and only use it internally to determine how posts and comments are sorted. . Then 3rd parties would buy out the data and we're back at square 1

t1_du1hpq1	1	*	Trump Blocks Release of Democratic Memo on Russian Probe. Don't see how this memo will change Mueller's investigation one way or the other. Here's the bigger threat:  https://www.vox.com/2018/2/9/16997508/rachel-brand-resigns-doj-trump-mueller. I don't say this lightly. But if they actually fire Muller at this point, we can have some real serious civil unrest. I mean, like something the States has never seen.. Well, you know, since that time a bunch of them seceded, followed by 5 years of bloodshed. . It may end up being worse than that. In which case, it WOULD be the most civil unrest that the United States has ever seen.. No, it won't be worse than the civil war. That's a silly thing to say.. How can you be sure? Weapons are different nowadays.. The civil war has the highest American death count of any war we've been involved in, including WWII. No, Trump firing Muller will not exceed that. That's the dumbest shit I've ever heard.. Well, you never know. It might lead to Civil War 2 and World War 3.

Do you not see the difference?. Corbyn will be PM. Hes got the people behind him. Corbyn I like Trump is a good person and a true leader.. Haha. No he won't, no he doesn't, and no he isn't. They're both scum, just in different ways.. You probably predicted Corbyn was gonna get crushed in the election too. . Firstly, we vote for parties, not candidates here. Secondly, his party didn't win the general election, so that proves one of your three claims wrong.. Lol thats what every neolib says. You lost. He won. He gained more power. If another election were held today he would win handedly. Give the people what they want before they take it from you. . I don't recall losing anything. And if by won you mean came in second place, then sure.

t1_du3x3xs	1	*	The Queen declares war on plastic after David Attenborough documentary: Buckingham Palace outlined new waste plans and said there was a strong desire to tackle the issue at the highest levels of the Royal household.. Why wasn't this issue focused in decades ago? Why so late? Plastic buildup has been an issue since before I was even born.. Old people finally starting to feel bad for letting the planet get fucked. . I suppose they did one thing right; they assured that we'd never be short of work to do. Younger generations will have to work very hard to clean up this mess of a planet.. Finally, some job security. That's what they've wanted all along right. And if the environment needed to be sacrificed, oh well.. Robots will take those jobs soon enough, I'm sure. Hopefully they'll be made from recycled plastic at least. . Damn intellectual and their efficiency! Now how am I gonna pull myself up by my bootstraps if there is a robot doing it already?. No need to worry! Soon we will have a new robot to pull you up by your bootstraps.. And a robot to rack in the benefits

Growing up in the 80s and watching science shows like 'Beyond 2000' realy hyped it up. . dat feeling dat you felt was >18 years ago. . Even worse, It was in the late 80s, so it was about 30 years ago.. Ugh. As a beginner oldman to a novice oldman, i hope your everything doesnt hurt when you get up from a chair or wake up in the morning.. Occasionally. The good news is that I saw an exoskeleton on beyond 2000 that will help us out. . i hope its easy to climb into or strap on. . It looked like it was out of Aliens.

That keeps bitcoin from crashing in value. Getting value out of bitcoin diminishes it's value? . Yes, because of the concept of supply and demand.. bitcoin has a fixed, finite supply.. There is also a finite number of poos I am going to make in my lifetime. Doesn't make them valuable.. I don't need to know why, but if someone is willing to give me something else in return for my poop, then that makes my poop valuable

Nah, the electoral college elected him. America didnt. He did not have the popular vote. . >Nah, the electoral college elected him. America didnt.  America chose the electoral college though. Ultimately the responsibility and blame is always on us for this shitshow.. Yeah several hundred years ago when the founding fathers imagined that the electoral college would be representative of each state, not that they could pick whatever they want.. If only you could amend the constitution in some way to change the system.. Theres a better chance of winning the lottery than getting America to amend the constitution.

Can you name a case of legitimate speech that was blocked because it was called hate speech?. People in the U.K. have been arrested for burning the Quran.

At the moment it is in the US, not in Germany, that you see Nazi flags on the streets.. Because germany made it a crime. In the US even the dumbest ideas are still legal.

Think you could buy an MP5 (the real fully-auto one) in the states for $20k if you have a really expensive license to own one on top of that. Could even be $30k, they are expensive. . It has to be made before 1986. 
t1_dt0gijt	1	*	The German government said on Friday that it would immediately stop approving arms exports to anyone participating in the war in Yemen including Saudi Arabia, a major buyer of German weapons.. The American government has no such qualms.... Well the US is one of the countries fully supporting Saudi in the war, so does This mean Germany wont sell to the USA?. Does the US government buy weapons from Germany?  Figured if anything it would be the other way around.. Yes. The US police/military uses P228s (M11), P320s (M17), HK MP5s, HK416s, and M320 Grenade Launchers. All of these are from Germany.. I'm sure that if they stopped selling those guns to America the German civilian market would pick up the surplus....oh wait..... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimated_number_of_guns_per_capita_by_country. >Germany: 30.3 guns per 100 capita  Much higher than I expected. Also quite a bit higher rate than Switzerland and especially Czech Republic who always get mentioned as positive examples in these discussions about gun ownership in Europe.

Its a tracer thats used as a spotting round to better range in the rocket that generally comes soon after.. Why 9mm though? A 7.62 would be a better choice. It dosent curve off after 50 meters. You want a round with a slower muzzle velocity.  It will closer follow the trajectory of the rocket.

Terrorism is most Western countries is historically illegal and socially unacceptable, so terrorism is radical and not conservative in those countries.. Nice playing with words, I guess the perpetrator is a Marxist false flag.. No? Politically motivated violence is far from the status quo, so its radical and anti-conservative.. Right, the behavior is not conservative. As much as you might want it, that does not take away the political alignment of the perpetrator..

Will we learn anything new in the next round?  Or will it just be more Russian social media posters?. We learned new things because of these indictments.

Not to say what they say isn't 100% false, but there's a bias to what they say, choose to report and not report. . Wikileaks said they release everything then refused to lease dirt on Russia. This proves Wikileaks is in bed with Russia.   . Politico pretends to be non bias, but they are.  This proves they are in bed with the liberals . No, the equivalent would be Politico killing a damaging story on a liberal. Strangely enough it's conservatives who keep doing this. Maybe you need to more closely examine your own side..

You don't seem to be able to come up with any kind of counter-argument and can only post ad-hominim attacks. I'm pretty sure I know which one of us spot on. Once again, conservative meet projection.

Hmm.. down voted to Oblivion (your post can still be seen) vs being actually removed (as in t_d)... I wonder which is worse..

Well sorry for ruining your day. Have a wonderful weekend ahead though.. You people are adorable.

You can easily get through him via Russia, give Putin a call. . Why would I call Putin? I don't have any Uranium to sell him. 2/10

Yeah, let's isolate them, like we did with North Korea. That worked out.. Worked pretty well.. It's a human rights nightmare with nuclear ICBMs and Chinese protection. In what possible fucking way has it worked well at all?. So they would be completely different if they had no sanctions? You sure you want to go with that one bud?. I suppose we'll never know. South Korea eventually transformed from a nasty dictatorship into a democracy. But then SK had the support of the west and NK was never going to get that.. Because it didn't want to...

t1_du25xi1	0	*	The worlds largest hotel chain is removing plastic straws from all 60 of its properties in Britain  including some of Londons best known five-star destinations  in the latest victory for the Standards Last Straw campaign.. Huh, that's cool.  I remember the Ghibli museum in Japan used straw straws in their cafe. Like straws that are hollow grass reeds.. Very cool. I didn't know these existed?. Well those were the original straws, heck it's where we got the name straws from. It's what people used before plastic became more common and took over.. My dad told me that they used paper/cardboard for straws before plastic came into use. Not sure of accuracy on that. . I can remember using paper straws back in the 70's. I don't know why we still don't use them.. They still sell them, I dont know why we do t use them either.   We used pasta as kids in the 80s. Bucatini was always in our house anyway and made great straws. . I can't find any Bucatini that's big enough for it. Last I got had such a small hole in the center I couldn't even move air through it.. Yeah, its gotta be the big ones. Years ago, I went to the 1700s themed restaurant at Greenfield Village in Dearborn and was tickled because their straws were the big bucatini pasta. 
t1_ds7ou83	0	*	Many UK CEOs earn more in three days than a typical worker does in a year. Probably because the work they do makes the shareholders 97% more than the average worker. . I am fairly certain a company needs the batallion of machine greasers exactly as much as the CEO at the top in order to deliver.. It needs the machine greasers more.   Fire all the machine greasers and the company stops dead that day. Fire the CEO and it can run largely undirected for a fiscal quarter or two at the least.. And tomorrow you can have a factory full of brand new machine greasers the very next day. . Only if you assume that onboarding and training costs are zero (which they aren't).. It takes minutes to train a machine greaser, and decades to groom a CEO. . You realize that for the purpose of this discussion we're using machine greaser as a generic placeholder for workers and not specifically just people who grease machines, right?. Well aware. Most labor is easily replaceable. Thats why they are paid so little.

You don't see this as unfairly discriminatory against Sikhs and Muslims? . All they have to do is put aside their religious beliefs to let them fairly carry out their role as representatives of the people.  Are they able to do that?. That is an absurd expectation to place upon anyone.. We expect it of lots of public servants.  If your religious beliefs are more important than serving the people, that's okay. Fuck off out of government though.. What you are doing is spitting on the very concept of secularism. It is completely unreasonable to expect that people abandon their religious convictions in order to hold public office.. Wtf are you smoking? That view is the very epitome of secularism, hardcore secularism. . What you're advocating is laicism, not secularism.

I don't want to walk around with my pants around my ankles again.. Well youre going to need some pretty tight pants for them to stay around your head as a hat so I dont think you need a belt, but if it gives you piece of mind go a head and get a belt too.

They've been pulling this pseudo racist Marxist bullshit for over a decade now and should be isolated from the world because of it . No fuck sanctions, if we do that they're just gonna blame us if their system collapses and it will just make it that much harder for them to reform.   . I agree, no need to do anything. They do this, it'll likely be the end of their agricultural economy.. All I say is that we *don't* send food aid when the inevitable starvation happens.  We can accept refugees from the persecuted class and let the rest of them starve.. So the whites only? . Well they're the ones being persecuted. . I have the sworn word of Hillary Rodham Clinton that whites cannot be persecuted.. *Sigh*

I just don't understand how they sleep at night knowing there is 18% left to go  Edit: Wow thanks for the gold random citizen.. well seeing as its world wide 1%, meaning anyone making over $30k, you tell me. That's pretty sad too consider that means 99% of the population makes a astronomically small amount.. stuff is cheeper where they live.. That's because stuff is lower quality where they live.. Uh, have you ever left your home country? Cuz Ive been to plenty where the food was a fraction of the price and of a much higher quality.  You literally have no clue what youre talking about do you?. I have been to different places i don't even have to leave my country to see that in lower income areas there are lower price/quality stores and such.. There is a fundamental difference between varying wealth in a single country and countries with varying wealth. Countries like Czechia are not just endless bargain stores.
t1_dt1y1xt	0	*	Worlds top 1% earn 82% of wealth generated in 2017, says Oxfam. Wealth inequality is a real problem, but it's important to remember that no matter your income, if you spend it all, your wealth will always be zero.. wealth inequality is harmless in and of itself. It's not a zero sum game. Wealth inequality can be however, a symptom of a larger issue, such as a lack of education. . > wealth inequality is harmless in and of itself.  It's not. Ignoring things such as links to violence, it harms the economy by stifling entrepreneurship. . Wealth is not zero sum. Me owning a $250k house does make me 250k wealthier, but does not make you 250k poorer. Same with other assets like stocks etc.... And with real estate? Is there an unlimited amount of land to own? Your owning a house on land certainly means there's less land for other people to put up houses. . And be buying Boeing stock means you can't buy those shares. Doesn't make you poorer. And yet increased concentration of wealth has corresponded with decreased public ownership of stocks... Correlation is not causation.

There are several socialist states that have not fallen apart though. which ones.. may I remind you that the Scandinavian countries aren't really socialist..  North Korea is actually the most successful socialist state.. and aren't those people just doing great!.

I was skeptical he would be re-elected initially, but as his presidency progresses I am finding it increasingly more likely. A lot of Republicans are very happy with what he is doing.. A lot of independents as well, how well the economy is doing is historically the number one indicator of an incumbent president getting reelected or not. Trump could legitimately hit 4-5% GDP growth.. Isn't Obama's Administration in part responsible for that GDP growth? I mean aside from the current boom in technology.

I think the move of the tapestry may also be symbolic of continued strong political unity between France and England. . Or it's a well timed piss take over Brexit.. Given that it shows the last time England was successfully invaded and by the French no less.. Normans are as far away from Modern France than Anglo Saxons are from modern Germans.. Tell that to the citizens of Bayeux who are upset about loaning their tapestry.  Bayeux being in Normandy by the way.. Oh no Im aware of the history, but some historians think it was commissioned by the brother of William and completed by English nuns as opposed to the Normans. . That's the main historical thought - William's half brother, Odo Bishop of Bayeux commissioned it is the most likely to have commissioned it after he was made Earl of Kent.

Why cant others take the reigns for a bit so we can reflect, recollect, and then push forward after we fix ourselves from within?  . Totally agree. I think Canada should lead with Japan..

Because people who have the money to buy it for 100m didnt get there by overpaying for things. Hence suggesting that it was bribery.. That makes zero sense.  Here.

You do know the UK is literally a theocracy, right?. No it's not, a theocracy is where religion runs the country. The UK is run by constitutional monarchy and a representative parliament.. The head of state is by definition the head of the state church, and if you are a catholic you are excluded from succession. Furthermore you have bishops with a part in the legislative process by law.. Which does not make the UK a theocracy, congratulations on not understanding other countries.. Would you call the Vatican a theocracy?. Yes...   You don't seriously think they are the same type of government do you?

Well, there's still their spouse, who likely shared the ideology, but won't necessary go to prison as well. They'd retain custody. . Do they take the children of paedophiles away from their spouses after they are arrested and put in prison?. If the spouse was complicit in the abuse, yes.. If their spouse is provably complicit in terrorism, why are they not in jail as well?. Probably because they couldn't prove she actively furthered any actual criminal activity. Approval is not a crime.. Look at us making things up on the fly, but we say it confidently, so it's probably true.. Silently in approval of a crime doesn't make you a criminal. Also how are they gonna prove in court that they approved of it.

TIL I'm still a youth in Canada.. children and youth under the age of 25 something the Ontario government says. like fuck, up until my birthday i was a youth with a mortgage. Wow. Just a few hours ago, my 7 year old niece argued that at 25, you still aren't a grown up because you're not a grown up until you're at least 30. TIL my niece works for the Canadian government . Arguably, eighteen year olds are still mentally children, you aren't fully developed until mid 20's or so.. Tell this to most 20 year olds and they'll argue and/or get upset, basically proving your point.. If you tell most adults over 20 they are mentally children they will get upset or argue it. . ha, cant beat me at my own game. one of the first things i say to new people is how im still mentally a child (am 23). i won....right? :D. Of course you did, little Billy. Here's your participation award. Now, go swing at that T-ball.

Trudeau is really accelerating this whole anti-freedom thing.  . Or else they don't get free money.  That is anti-freedom?. Setting specific political requirements in order to obtain funds is absolutely anti-freedom. It's called political persecution. . No it isn't.. Yes it is.. Lol, no, refusing a group free money is not political oppression.  But please explain how it is.. It is if you're using a political position such as abortion to decide who gets money.  . And the oppression is where? Those groups not getting the free money stops them from doing stuff how?

Have the balls and make pro-life groups illegal then.  . Because it is the government's money so they can set policies on how it is spent?   Nothing to do with legal.

Well I mean technically they're not wrong. He probably IS out of touch with mainstream America, ifs just not relevant as he's Canadian. does.... does she know that Canada is like.... not part of the USA?. I honestly don't think so, probably thinks Canada is just the largest state or something. I bet she also thinks that Queen Elizabeth holds absolute power in the UK. Iirc she technically does but in doing so it would be the end of the monarchy . Even technically she does not hold *absolute* power, it has been centuries since a British monarch has been above the law, on paper or otherwise.. AFAIK she is quite literally above the law in that she is *personally immune from criminal and civil actions*   Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_immunity#United_Kingdom.

t1_dtd95vz	1	*	More than 60,000 Americans RSVP'd to fake political events planted by Russians on Facebook. I'm sure that more than that number of Americans have inadvertently opted-in to entirely-American-based spam crap.. Americans don't like being told what to do by other countries. It's our thing. Screw over fellow Americans, that's fine. Other countries screw us over? Now we got a fucking problem.. Apparently we dont have a problem. Our president is still not convinced that the Russians interferes with the election. He hasnt made an authoritative statement as such.. Because it got him elected.. The GOP constituency resurrecting McCarthyism in many ways this past decade while currently defending and even celebrating Russia however, hurts my fucking head.  . Denial is a fickle mistress..

Because the hivemind hates complex issues and downvotes anything that says otherwise. . That has nothing to do with you asking a question that you already know the answer to. Sure it does.  State a fact and get downvoted to oblivian.  Ask a question and maybe some people will actually think. State a fact and then try to use it to prove some BS like no go comes and politicians getting burned and you will be rightfully downvoted.  Why is that hard to understand?

A friend got busted at a red light when a cop jumped out of a bush he was hiding in. They bust people smoking weed more than cellphones from what I hear. Sigh! At least mobiles are dangerous so I can understand using resources to do this, weed though.... Weed isn't totally safe.  It's just that making it illegal does more harm than good.

I used and threw away *four separate straws* just to finish my drink because of how easily they fell apart.. Or you could drink directly from the cup.. Or just laminate the gosh darn straws so they can do the one thing they're intended to do.. Yeah, but if you drink directly from the cup you are generating less waste.. It doesn't matter, it's just paper
t1_duu38wq	1	*	Taiwan to ban single-use plastic drinking straws, plastic bags, disposable utensils entirely by 2030. Paper straws are actually pretty good. they taste terrible. which shouldn't happen. plastic doesn't impart a taste on the beverage.   that said i've given up using mcds straws at all when i order a meal there. I think you just need to suck it up and deal with a mild aftertaste in the aim of improving our environment.. Why should I deal with that when I can just not use a straw?. Erm, is anyone actually arguing that? Who is forcing you to use paper straws against your will? Of course just not using a straw is way better than using a paper one.. You were talking about having to suck it up to improve the environment. I think no compromises are needed.. Not even for a pun?. Haha puns are great.
t1_dunlj22	0	*	Taiwan to ban single-use plastic drinking straws, plastic bags, disposable utensils entirely by 2030. So what'll replace single use straws in households? Metal cleanable straws?. What do you use straws for in a household? I can't think of any use of it in my house. In the past I have only bought straws to make craft work.. Drinking milkshakes and cocktails, or actually any other fluid. It's quite convenient.. Or, now hear me out, just put the glass to your mouth.. Then youre not doing milkshakes right. Theres a reason Dairy Queen serves them upside down.. >in a household  If I made a milkshake that thick at home, I would just use a spoon. What about a standard smoothie? That still needs a straw for the optimal consumption experience.. I know I'm not the only one who drinks a smoothie from the glass. It's just easier for me.

INB4 trump signs a mandate requiring use of hairspray by every american, help create jobs *and* he gets to stick it to the liberal obama lovers. Hairspray no longer contains chloroflourocarbons and thus can no longer contribute to ozone depletion.  There aren't actually that many things that contain CFCs anymore..

I suspect it's more that they want to help a shitty, toothless version get enacted so that the public pressure for that sort of thing goes away since we've already got one. . Depends on who actually writes it. The Bill of Rights as they stand today has protected the citizens of The United States, so hopefully this does the same for consumers of the internet. . AT&T is proposing this, not James Madison. Of course, that's precisely the comparison they want you to draw from the name.. It has to happen, just because AT&T proposed the idea doesn't necessarily mean that it has to be by their rules. who would you consider to actually write this if it had to be written?. Teddy Roosevelt . LMFAO! That's funny but if everyone makes a joke about everything nothing will get done correctly. If tomorrow you were asked who should create this Bill who would you choose?. An FCC that isn't corrupt.

I don't support infant circumcision, but it is a major part of both religions.. >...it is a major part of both religions.  And that shouldn't matter one iota.  The world needs less religion and more reality.. You aren't going to deconvert them by outlawing the religion, either in whole or part.. No one is trying to de-convert anyone. They're stopping religious zealots from mutilating babies.. >  They're stopping religious zealots from mutilating babies.  This doesn't stop it from happening. Just stops the possibility of it taking place in a hospital.. And ideally, it would result in dangerous people who cut up and mutilate baby genitalia being put in prison..

The man himself is probably thrilled, regardless of his public face.. He's THE Pope, The word of God, Why would he need to appease members on such matters of protecting child rapists?. Surprise, as an excatholic, the church is in to TONS of REALLY shady shit, I wish more Catholics would look into that kinda stuff. Shady shit like what. Like covering up child rape.. He said a ton not one instance. You really think there has only been one instance of child rape over the course of the religion?

This doesn't seem like a delayed response to a massacre 7 years ago.

Very next line  >Today, it has become clear that there is a parliamentary majority in favour of the governments proposal.  And they're voting to implement it now. What's your point?. That while events in america might have sparked new life in the conversation they didn't start it.  It isn't like they watched the news and wrote down a bill. I didn't claim they watched the news and wrote the bill. They watched the news and shifted in support of passing the bill. You're splitting hairs.. I disagree. The impression you gave was that recent events in US lead to this ban.. It has not passed yet and I argue would not have passed if not for the US news.. The point is **the entire process** started long **before** any of that stuff ever happened in America.

Anders Breivek, who did the shooting, did it in protest of the influx of Muslim immigrants to Norway.. And because he was a nutjob who believed communists were waiting to get him around every corner.. They should have built more straight roads, so the communists couldn't hide around the corners..

In fact I would say that America hasnt really won ANY war since ww2, and those conflicts are stalemates at best.

Claiming they are valid in their beliefs and trying to use this as evidence. So not much different.. How is a situation where whites are systematically killed by another racial group *NOT* evidence for why ethnic nationalism might be necessary for white people to turn to?. Because its in response to white nationalists doing the same to black people less than 20 years ago.  . So until one group decides to forego ethnic nationalism (where other groups may or may not give it up too, and likely have historic grudges), we are stuck in a violent cycle..

t1_dtdh618	0	*	Cryptocurrency hack victims to get refund. I wouldn't be surprised if this was an inside job. If it was then these guys basically made about 50 million off this.. $530 million. Read the article.. >One of Japan's largest digital currency exchanges has said it will refund most of the **$534m** (xa3380m) worth of virtual assets lost in a hacking attack.. they're refunding less than that . Oh, the guy's math was so off that I misunderstood his statement and thought he was just talking about the theft.  $534m - $423m = >50m. To wash the money they need to convert it and go through some exchanges that take percentages. They'll end up with 50-70 left.. Says the guy whose headmath is in question... ;)

Uk student loans are not debt, like in the US.. UK student loans need to be repaid once you start earning over a certain amount annually. This is still a debt as it still needs repaying..

Can confirm being Canadian is pretty good. Sure we have problems here but I always feel safe. Canada is like a poor mans Switzerland. Just keeps to themselves no one bothers us so we don't bother them. Although I do love knowing that Switzerland had booby-trapped all mountain pass entrances and had caches of weapons hidden around the country in the event that anyone dared attack them.   . I like the sound of that. Canada needs some of those booby-traps. Maybe we already have some and don't know of them. Your booby traps are the arctic to the North, and US to the South. And the Arctic is the tame one.. Russia, the US and even China are trying to make claims to our artic. We don't even have the ships to go up there and project force to back up our claims to it. All those others guys do. . Any source on the US claiming the Arctic?

t1_dur5ykp	1	*	North Koreas Winter Olympics cheerleaders are being 'forced into sexual slavery,' says a defector. I always wondered if Kim Jung Un is forcing pretty women to have sex with him. . Pretty sure I read somewhere his wife was a former cheerleader. Maybe it is just a bad translation or something. Maybe cheerleader in North Korea means Prostitute. I think his wife was a high end escort turned pop singer. Also he had the other members of the pop group executed to hide the fact his wife was a prostitute. . His wife was also executed after a porno she did surfaced on the net.. > His wife was also executed after a porno she did surfaced on the net.  Seriously? More details please.. That was actually my mistake. I remember hearing about this years ago and mentally closed the book - turns out she's been seen since.. Wasnt she at the olympics? Or was that his sister?. Sister

Actually it's a pretty shitty metaphor. The intended purpose is great, but have you ever seen a bull in a china shop? Much more cautious than you'd think.. Have you ever kicked a bull in the nuts when it was in a china shop?              . Have you?. Would just standing around wondering how that bull got in the china shop in the first place make life worth living?

But how do we, as in human race, stop it?. Apparently even acknowledging the problem is a big step for some. But besides that, polluting less would be good.. become vegetarian or vegan. failing that limit the amount of days you eat meat. its the most effective simple thing that you can do. I would also add 'stop buying shit you don't really need'. But then what would I use my Prime membership for!  I need that bamboo cell phone holder for my nightstand! . Bamboo is a really fast-growing and sustainable material.  If you're going to buy shit you don't need, then bamboo isn't a bad option.... Yah I know, I'm bad at making jokes.

Yes boycotting Israel is anti semitism. She should be tried for hate crimes. . Disagreeing with Israel is not disagreeing with all Jewish people.. It is. 6 million Jews died and Israel is their safe haven. . Interesting idea, the safe haven. Unfortunately there were already people living there. That's where it all came unstuck..

And frequented by edgy Europeans that will seek out a reason to bash the U.S. And even edgier Americans that are eager to self-deprecate to show how they're different from the rest.. There are actual reasons people dislike the US. I'm sure some people are just being edgy, but saying that *all* critics of the US are just doing it to be edgy is disingenuous at best.

t1_dunwjix	0	*	McDonald's plans to drop foam packaging globally by 2019 and will also switch to packaging made from recycled materials in every location by 2020.. I've never seen styrofoam packaging in a chain fast food joint in Europe. Where do they use this?. I actually have never seen it at McDonalds, or BK, or Wendys. I haven't seen styrofoam used in fast food for 15 years. The thin cardboard and paper is cheaper.. Where do you live?   Here on the east coast McDonald's tea comes in styrofoam, and so do at least the breakfast platter things.. Actually in Europe the pancakes come in styrofoam. Never noticed it on any other product though.. In the Midwest, a large sweet tea comes in a styrofoam cup. That and the breakfast plate are the only two things I can think of though.. Because the plastic makes tea taste terrible. . Ayyyye I learned something today, thanks stranger.. We gotta stop learning stuff just because someone said it on the internet. Though in this case he may not be wrong.

So, headscarfs mean much more than a religious symbol for women (only).  . If thats what you take from it, thats your opinion.  Mine just makes me feel modest and devoted.. Devoted to a religion started by a guy that married a 6 year old? I don't understand this. Mary was likely in her teens when God raped her you know.. I'm not a Christian but teen is different than 6 and in Islam Mohammed is a human. God is not a human in Islam or Christianity . that's the stupidest fucking thing I've ever heard in my life.. Please explain. Mohammed is a real person in history. God is not. God is Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ was human.

Because my mom and sister decided not to wear one and nobody stopped them.. So... just liie how I own a gun but I've never killed any one therefore guns are not a tool of violence. Same logic. . Well they are inherently a tool of violence. But a Hijab is fabric.. ...and a gun is just made of metal.  Describing a thing by its components does not change it's purpose. . A guns job is to kill. A Hijab is for wearing.. A guns job is to kill. A hijab's job is to stop a woman from showing her body. Correct me of i'm wrong but Hijab means to veil or cover. . You can take a Hijab off if you don't want. You can't unkill stuff. Please stop making me resolutely defend a covering I think is ugly.

You mean how the homeless are treating property that's not theirs?. Who owns public benches?. Tax payers. And I say this as someone whos been homeless.. So you lose access to benches when you lose your job?. They arent losing access to benches.. True, but they are losing the ability to sleep on benches (easily, at least).. The bars on the bench prevent everyone from sleeping on them not just the homeless. People with homes generally sleep in their homes.

Eventually if so many do it they will be forced to care. Realistically, they won't be forced to care, they will only be forced to have the cops drag you away to somewhere they don't have to look at you. Business as usual will continue uninterrupted..

It's reality, sadly, the US managed to enforce that bullcrap type of IP over the entire world.. Copyright laws are *much* worse in the US because of how our legal system works. It's much easier for large companies to engage in spurious lawsuits over here. . True, part of the resistance against TIPP (I think that's the one) was because of IP laws. Still got a lot of excessive legislation in that regard though.

None of that has anything to do with an ambassador's job. . I know.  Im asking you what, position, that Trump has put is in youre referring to. . Shithole countries.

I'm glad I'm not the only one who caught the subtle normalization of fascism.. I dont want fascism to be mainstream or normal. I also dont want to see people ambushed and beaten on the streets.. Then you need to fight fascism.   Do you think we should just hug ISIS?. If you think the only way to fight an idea is with violence, then you are no better than an animal..

There were also the old PT Boats, such as the one JFK served on during WWII. I assume the Navy still keeps a fleet of similar small attack craft. Hulls made from plywood, too?.

t1_dtgsbhf	0	*	Big game hunter shot dead while hunting lions in Africa. 50/50 whether this thread decides Fuck him, he deserved it. Or The sale of hunting permits is essential to fund conservation.  Reddit being Reddit one will be correct and the other met with outrage.. I kinda agree with both though.. I'm a little from both as well, but people's refusal to understand the other frustrates me.. If you're for the conservation of animals I do not see how you could be against humane hunting practices.. Really? You don't see how people who love animals might be sad when animals are killed? You might not agree with them but surely you can see why they might feel like that?. The animals that are being hunted are old/sick and would be killed anyway.. If the animals are old/sick and would die anyway, why not just let them die naturally? . Because they can be a danger to the other animals. They can be more aggressive and start attacking other animals.
t1_dtgrcj5	1	*	Big game hunter shot dead while hunting lions in Africa. Would have preferred mauled to death by a lion, but this will do.. Then the lion would most likely be killed as it would be considered a threat to humans. You're goddamn right it's a threat to humans, it's a fuckin' lion!  I think there's a Chris Rock segment about this.. Kat Williams no? And its tigers, but same point. I think we might both be right.. Okay maybe they stole each others jokes. I remember a Kat Williams one about the guy who got killed at the zoo for jumping in the tiger pen. Motherfucker am I a tiger? I dont feel like a tiger?. Maybe I'm a ferocious-ass koala bear..

When will democrats learn,  the system is in place to prevent majority rule.. The system was originally put in place to keep the power in the hands of the elite and out of the hands of the common people. .  That's what I said.. You literally said it was to prevent majority rule. Two different things.. The common people are the majority.  And nobody wants the layman in charge. . Well we elected one of them.

Wow just think about how absurd that is.. Oh it absolutely is, but welcome to 2018. We have a president who, instead of getting up in front of the press, just screams into the void of the internet . why should be speak to a press that is absolutely biased against him only to have those words go through their filter when he can bypass them completely and speak to everyone with internet access? . Because those press conferences are typically televised, you can quite easily watch them yourself. Or he can just tweet it and skip the middle man. Twitter isn't the problem, its the ridiculous shit that he says on it.   . I think you have a point, can you imagine how much better his image would be if he just shut the fuck up since day one.

It's not the best show ever made but I'd argue it's one of the most consistently entertaining.. Yeah I enjoyed it greatly, although by the end the Marshalls seemed to be more dickish and I was pullin more for Boyd. Boyd is probably my favorite antagonist in any show. His relationships with Raylan and Ava is one of the best things about the series.. I'm glad they kept him around. He was originally just going to be the season 1 baddie, but he fucking killed it and become the archnemesis. I fucking love that show. Especially his final gunfight.

Probably more educated people than you give credit for too. My mom has two bachelors degrees and a master's degree and she voted for him.. Very true as my father is the same way, but education is positively correlated with liberal beliefs so they are probably the outliers Id imagine. . Trump won college educated whites.

Stark difference between that and peace.. Ceasefires *are* a form of peace between nations.. Yeah, just like reloading is a form of ceasefire peace.. Reloading means you are *interrupting* a fire order so that can resume firing.  Ceasing fire means that you no longer wish to attack something.. It's called a sarcastic response to a idiotic comment.

Then they should also file cases with the WTO against western markets that they believe they should be allowed to have greater access to.. That takes too long. Might take years. Bullshit.. Well is the west can go through this long process to be treated fairly then so can China.. But China doesn't require the West to go through that process, so why would China have to?. Well apparently it does, the West is literally having to go through the WTO to get back on even terms, did you even read the article?
