t3_7xtd5w	0	*	German military short on tanks for NATO mission | The German military is under-equipped to take on its upcoming role as leader of NATO's anti-Russian defense force, a leaked document shows. Opposition politicians say the defense minister is to blame. To be fair, it is a tall order to match Russia on tank numbers. . Germany + 28 other countries should easily be able to counter the number/sophistication of Russian tanks . Why?. NATO has 5x the population and 20x the economic capacity of lil Russia. No, why should WE match them is my question . Deterrence? Because I don't want to fight a future war with Russia. . Ah. What is holding them up to steamrole us now?. Deterrence, sweetheart. . From What. The nonexisting / not operational Tanks? Comon Sweetheart, I am just waiting for you to say nukes.

We should do this in the US. . >The idea is believed to be popular among members of online military forums as long as they can keep their ranks and entitlements.   They too were bored.. FTFY: This idea is believed to be poplar.... Some say China will be Evergreen for this initiative.. This is a good use of soldiers time while theyre on fir-lough.. Birch please. . Yeah, oak eh, I'm sycamore of these.. Oh, quit pining for a different pun thread. . I like the pun comments, all this attention maple more countries into the initiative.
t3_7xuelp	1	*	China reassigns 60,000 soldiers to plant trees in bid to fight pollution. Well isn't China already building a green wall alongside the dessert in the north to stop it from spreading. I don't know if this is part of it, but yes, China has been planting trees and plants around the Gobi Desert to stop the increasing desertification.. Ironically,  the desert helps to seed the ocean which is a greater carbon sink than the forests..  Higher CO2 levels in the ocean lead to issues tho.  (Algae bloom,  jellyfish) . Including ocean acidification! The ocean is not the solution.. How is a gigantic body of water not solution? . Because its a solvent . Pure water is solvent definitely, but shouldnt sea water be considered as solution as it contains minerals and compounds?. So it should be considered a solved?  ^^^^^^^\s

Now you're just off on a tangent. . Don't be so divisive. I can't think of anything to add to this chain. Maybe if we multiply our powers.... So to sum up, we should divide and conquer the remainder of the product to get to the root of it all?

They can do that any other time, the Olympics is not the place.. They are not doing it in the Olympics, but in a private area.. Same shit, it's still the olympics, Just use your room.. What's wrong with a more ceremonial area?. They shouldn't spend more building a prayer room, the tax payers have paid enough.. This is a very small cost.
t3_8164c5	1	*	Women in Syria 'forced to exchange sexual favours' for UN aid.. Its so common in war affected areas. That's why, many of them hate international workers. . That's why many of them will accept Assad. Sure torturing extremists is bad but at least his soldiers aren't raping everyone they can get their hands on.. You dont think Assads soldiers are raping women?. As far as I know they aren't. . But if you had to guess.... Its like guessing the ocean has fish in it.. Water? Oh; never touch the stuff. Fish fuck in it.. That white runoff? It's whale sperm. . The whole ocean is. Whales are weird.
t3_7p6chl	0	*	Snow falls in Sahara desert for third time in 40 years. Just waiting for all the people trying to claim this is proof against global warming. Why are heatwaves used to prove global warming exists but cold weather can't be used to say the opposite?. They're both wrong. No single climate event can be directly attributed to global warming. You have to look at the overall trend.. And the trend says the earth has been getting warmer since the end of the ice age. It hasn't been getting warmer this quickly until the Industrial revolution, we also understand the scientific process of how modern industry makes the earth warmer, it isn't just a guess.. Yeah but there isn't a scientific consensus on the matter. I'll wait on that.   Edit: watch this https://youtu.be/uRNO1LFQBWI. You're incorrect, the scientific consensus is that it's human caused. Hmmh I don't think so. If there is one I haven't heard about it. It matters little anyway I guess - science isn't democratic.. What was your opinion on the IPCC 2014 report? I assume someone like you who is making such bold claims has read it and a plethora of valid criticisms.

If anything, shows how much each community wants to wipe the other from the face of the planet. Good stuff.. Yeah except there's only one country actually erasing another, which is Israel. . Which country is Israel erasing?. Palestine. This might seem a technicality but you made the argument around it so, the Palestinians wouldn't be fighting for nationhood if they already had one.. Tell it to the dozens of countries that recognize Palestine, they're fighting Israel for independence. and yet none of them recognize Kurdistan.. Israel does.  
t3_81om0k	0	*	Australia considers banning ISPs from listing internet speeds they cannot provide. Also mobile phone carriers should not be allowed to list their data plan as 'unlimited' when it really isn't. Then none could because there are physics limits. That said, it's bullshit when they say unlimited then you get 2G speeds after 22GB.. Thats still unlimited. They dont say you get max speed for entire unlimited. . How is that unlimited?! That's the complete opposite of unlimited.. If you can use it no matter your data usage, thats unlimited. Throttling doesnt mean its not unlimited. Just means the speed isnt unlimited. .. Limited speed means limited amount. I'm sorry you're stupid.  PS - I can't *use* a lot of the stuff I would otherwise if I'm limited to 2G speeds.. If you still have internet access no matter how much you use, then is unlimited. . You're stupid, illiterate, or both. You ever look up the definition of limited?. The definition can be applied in more than one way. Unlimited speed is not same as unlimited data. 
t3_7uv503	1	*	Trudeau Threatens to Leave Nafta Rather Than `Take Any Old Deal'. Didn't Trump want to kill NAFTA? Presumably replacing it with something better, but he might be better at dropping out of trade deals than making them.. Trump's been a terrible deal maker so far; his strategies from the business world  just don't work in the political world.. He's been a terrible deal maker his whole life. His real talent is in marketing. And bullying.. And being a complete tool. . So marketing?. Along with four dozen other things tools do. . I've never seen a Milwaukee 12v Wife Raping tool and I go to Home Depot all the damn time. Oh god. You just reminded me of that paramedic horror story with the sawzall and the make-shift murder dildo.
t3_7uv503	1	*	Trudeau Threatens to Leave Nafta Rather Than `Take Any Old Deal'. Didn't Trump want to kill NAFTA? Presumably replacing it with something better, but he might be better at dropping out of trade deals than making them.. I think his tactic is to take his ball and go home. Then he feels like he has the power and that everyone will fall on their knees and give him what he wants just to play again.. Look at how that turned out for Britain. . Brexit ended up being a great thing for Britain. Compare their stock index to EU then get back to me on why they should have made themselves a dummy puppet of a failing German economy . A rule of thumb: An active poster in T_D is probably living in the United States, as such, their opinion on Brexit is a lot less informed than someone who actually lives in Britain.. A rule of thumb: Anyone who references a users post history is probably not very intelligent and shouldn't be taken seriously.. Yeah, it's not like the things a person says and the communities they join say anything about them /s. Yeah because we should totally judge and be dismissive of what someones says because of the groups their in and not the actual argument they're raising /s. I like turtles /s
t3_7xgogl	1	*	New Dutch law makes every adult an organ donor. Netherlands narrowly passed new legislation on that will register every citizen aged 18 and over as a potential organ donor, unless they explicitly choose to opt out.. As long as there is an option to opt out, then it's not so bad. If it were mandatory that you be a donor, I'd take issue with it. . > If it were mandatory that you be a donor, I'd take issue with it.   why?. Because governments have no place telling people what they can do with their body. . But youre dead. Is it still your body?. Wow this isn't a joke is it?  . Er no? How can you own something if you're dead?. Idiot. Ever heard of a will?. A will is who you give it to. Because you dont own it anymore.  Edit: if you still owned it, you wouldnt need a will in the first damn place. . But of your dead then you dont own it anymore and hence you dont have the authority to decide who gets it
t3_7v1fsd	1	*	YouTube will start labeling videos that receive government funding. It's about time.  YouTube, Facebook and Twitter all need to do more to curb government influence and propaganda.. Government pays cut-out company, company pays ad company. Are they able to track that because if not I just foiled their plan in 3 seconds. . Pfft. That's like using an LLC to bribe a porn star.. Is that a reference?. Trump used donations to his campaign to pay for a porn star I believe . I just read the links posted. I'm amazed that wasnt a bigger scandal.. Considering it's been denied in legal statements by both people, I would imagine the doubt over it is bigger than the scandal.. Only source was the Fire and Fury book. I'm not a Trump supporter but I wouldn't trust a book that can't hire an editor to correct simple spelling mistakes let alone confirm sources.. A book written by known fabulist and liar Michael Wolff, no less. His autobiographical novel about Silicon Valley is pretty much entirely made up.

Yet, unions do it all the time.. Couldn't be less relevant. I disagree - a union telling people how to vote should be illegal, if it's illegal for an employer to tell people who to vote for (which I had never heard of before).  .

How is it any different than when British royalty has an child? . The British royalty aren't a hereditary dictatorship they are a constitutional monarchy. That makes it less news worthy how?. If you want to leave Canada you wouldn't be shot in the back as you leave, the royale family doesn't tell tell its people to eat dirt if they're hungry, the royale family isn't built on communism. You're just listing differences between NK and the UK or Canada, which no one is debating. . She is a terrible person as to the royale family isn't.... Have fun in your dark little corner. HAHAH Yeah, because she has a total say in everything she does. Also, I think you're missing my point entirely, but we can agree to disagree.

I dont particularly want to know. I ask cuz my grandpa isn't doing so well...... You want to mount your grandfathers corpse? Or has it always been a desire of your grandpas to have a human head on his trophy wall? Hoping your pops pulls through or dies a noble death, or whatever .

Almost all of Nazi Germany's citizens agreed the Jews are no more than filth and should be terminated. Doesn't mean they were right, buddy. Nazi Germany was 1 country. And the Polish, and some more countries. And in the case of Jerusalem, who doesn't agree she's Israel's capital? A bunch of clueless countries as well. .

Either Israel needs to absorb all the land they won in war and call it part of Israel or gtfo.   .

Verbal assault isn't covered by free speech in the US either.. Making sexists remarks is legal.. That's not what this is about though. The title is misleading.. It is still ridiculous to ban speech that isn't an imminent threat or slander.. What's ridiculous is not having the right to be treated with minimum courtesy..

If not I'd suggest not pushing your conservative views for events in countries that may find it socially acceptable. Fun fact; brothels are legal in Aus.. > Fun fact; brothels are legal in Aus.  Fun fact: indecent exposure is illegal in NZ: http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1981/0113/latest/DLM53587.html . Breasts are not genitals btw but nice try.. If female breasts were not legally classified as genitalia, grabbing a female breast would have been a common assault, rather than a sexual assault.. It can be of sexual nature and not directly involving genitalia. Simple. Breasts are not genitals.. Good luck arguing that in court. . Good luck arguing with a dictionary.

Either way, they save and improve lives, you make a fool of yourself on social media. . The lives that can afford it. And I don't feel like much of a fool, to be real.. Fools usually dont.

Yeah when I read the title my first thought was holy shit, it happened again? . Canada and their damn zombies! We need a border in the north, perhaps a wall of ice. And we will make them pay for it too!. Naw, just have it be an addition to a 2-minute minor. Shit would be done in a week. 2 minutes for hooking; also, 2 days helping with the construction of the wall.. 5 minute major is a donation of ice and a timmys run for a week.. Can we mess up the actual boundaries of the wall and accidentally include Minnesota as part of Canada? Asking for a friend... actually we did a long time ago, and some of Lake of the Woods is in Canada.

Yeah, we had the same thing here. Nobody on the left will admit it though. Lots of people on the left admit that Clinton was a bad candidate.  . Well thats just cuz everyone knows she's terrible. Right, left, that's a bipartisan issue lol . I'd still take her over Trump any day of the week and twice on Sunday!. I wouldn't taken her at all.

A decade?. Maybe it's okay to overshoot when you've generally repressed someone for all of history.. If men get to stay home and have wealthy women marry them and provide money I'm sure most would be OK with it.. Ah yes, it's okay that you're treated unequally because occasionally it's comfortable discrimination.. Im just saying if you want to discriminate against men atleast give the benefits, too. Personally, no discrimination would be the ideal.. We already got our benefits, do you not understand this?. No, men in the past got their benefits. Were not men in the past. .

Why do you think only a country could be behind it? Why do you think it's specifically a government group and not a random person or group.. Because only one country has a history of it, and coincidentally, they were banned.  . You think Russia is the only country with a history of cyber warfare? . No, but they were the only ones banned.

Please tell me their is a recording of crew/command reactions as it happened.  Because that has to be the most desperately suicidal thing i could imagine.. Sadly no at the time of this everyone not assigned to weapon systems were ordered below deck while navy seals were active.. Not only did they attack a navy boat no it was the Enterprise with navy seals on board. That seems like an incredibly bad decision on the pirates part.. High risk high reward. Imagine if they pulled it off. . Hmmm lets see, Ive set my Luck to 10, but my Endurance to and Intelligence to 1.   ....hey look a big boat! Lets go see whats on it!

But how is it not against the rules to combine 2 countries teams? Genuinely curious. . I think they're technically still in a civil war. Sorta like how Taiwan is still technically part of mainland China.. They didn't sign a truce, that's for sure, only a cease-fire.. 60 years ago. Their correct, official diplomatic status is 'at war'.  Edit: corrections below, not a ceasefire, but an armistice. They didn't sign a ceasefire either; it was an armistice. Whats the difference? . Armistice is formal, where they both agree to stop fighting. Ceasefire is a temporary agreement to cease aggression for a limited amount of time. . Then how's that different from being at peace or not being at war? I'm legitimately curious.. during a cease fire. you can still cross the delaware and murder some redcoats during a christmas party..

Just because he's declared bankruptcy a number of times, doesn't mean he's broke. In his case it just means he knows how to game the system.. See my other comment.. I'll buy into it when it's finally presented as fact rather than speculation and hearsay as it has been presented for the last two years people have been talking about it.. Is there proof otherwise? We have one tax return to go off of, and it was the year he got married and needed financials in order.

If China starts taunting trump with goals like these wed get somewhere. . We don't have pollution problems like China. It won't happen until it actually benefits American citizens and businesses.. Not an expert but I remember hearing that the air quality in LA was pretty damn bad.. It's actually gotten a lot better, but that's because California is a bit more progressive than many other parts of the country when it comes to environmental regulations.. And with Cali being such a huge market, those regulations' effects tend to trickle outward.  The vehicle market especially.. Got a trickle, need a flood, time to stop pissing around.   Note: This isn't an angry response, I thought the words and I like how they sound.. The only way around the trickle is the societal equivalent of ripping our dicks out and not living luxuriously.

DS2 was amazing bro.. DS2 was amazing, but I feel when compared to the other two it falls short. Still a much better game then most, and the dlc was solid. . Let's be honest, the only reason people don't say DS3 also falls short is alllllll that nostalgia to DS1 they threw in.

After WW2 the US never policed the world. The US, just like Russia, just fucked with it.. Policing involves maintain your order of law. The Cold War and Vietnam were proxy wars for the proliferation of Capitalism (our law) over Communism.. You got this from Fox News? And since the US lost, did capitalism lose too?. No. What do you think Vietnam/Cold War was fought for? . Oh my, you think it was capitalism vs communism? LOL!. Oh, you're a troll. You got me. Good job.

It's a royal wedding, it's not like they'll be lacking in security. . POTUS security would have its own process that overlaps with Royal security, interferes with some, and adds a bunch of annoyance.. I dont see how American security can top what we have in the UK though, i mean, we have signs that tell people not to go in places and everything. Aren't all those signs in Welsh though?. Wales isn't a real place, it's something we made up to confuse foreigners.. Cymru am byth. Am foreigner, am confused.

Which would be more meaningful if you had a control subject - an identical planet that _DIDN'T_ have growing cities.. Are you suggesting that humans are not the cause of the historically unprecedented rise in the average global temperature? What then do you believe is causing it?

There's supposed to be a difference between supper and dinner? They're exactly the same to me. Supper is meant to be later than dinner I believe. Think it was quite an old fashioned thing.

I just thought they actually served a purpose in helping keep dirt out unlike having forskin that doesn't have any cleanliness benefits. The things you know. . The foreskin protects the glans from dirt, dust, pollutants, etc. . No it doesn't it traps dirt. That's why you have to pull it back to properly clean it.  I've also never had segnma.

And as a preventive measure against masturbation... but he also advocated it as a punitive measure.. Oddly enough, that was also his idea for corn flakes.. I wonder if people know this isn't a joke . but it kinda is.  I'm cut, eat cornflakes and masturbate all the time.  He was a quack.. The cornflakes you eat aren't the cornflakes he invented. His didn't have added sugar.. still won't stop me from masturbating.. And dried stains on your mattress resemble corn flakes

Wait till we start giving them guns.  Just kidding! Haha! What kind of civilized country would ~~let~~ give minors ~~buy~~ easy access guns!. America sure doesn't, so who knows.. Not a handgun, but long guns? Yep, sure can. Rifles, shotguns, etc.  There are a few places where they can't, but its not prohibited overall. I'm not sure where that's the case, but I can see the logic. After all, long guns are used in under 3% of firearms deaths. It's less dangerous than giving your kid a car.. Fair enough. Though note that ~~most~~ about a third of accidental firearm deaths in the US involve teenagers and people in their early 20's.. Most of a minuscule number isn't a crisis.. Hundreds of deaths yearly due to accidental shootings is not a miniscule number.  Though I should clarify that after checking, it wasn't a majority, it was around 1/3rd who were under 25.. Hundreds of deaths in a country with close to half a billion people is a minuscule number. More people are killed by lightning every year than long guns.

t3_7tk6f4	0	*	Corbyn pledges 8,000 homes for rough sleepers. Labour government would immediately buy 8,000 homes and help councils take over empty properties.. Take over sounds a lot like stealing.. I think he means the same forced buy outs they do when they build motorways     Kinda stealing and they try to avoid them but they do definitely get paid . Isn't the right to property big over there? . As big as anywhere else but in any country the gov can definitely just buy out your stuff   Or it would be impossible to build roads or anything that spans large areas wouldnt it? . Not the same thing. This is redistribution of property via the state. . that's literally what eminent domain is. most countries have some form of it. Not to give to another person.. If it's for public use, then it's for a lot of people.. So why would I buy a home if this is going to happen? Makes no sense.

No, he's saying that it wouldn't be fair to the dog to be subjected to trump constantly.. Ahhh, that makes a lot more sense.

US has better freedom of speech than we do in the UK. They're very similar I'd say. Though hate speech is tolerated less in the UK. . The term hate speech drives me nuts. It's so subjective, impossible to properly define, and a giant gateway to mass censorship hiding under the thin veil of protecting people's feelings.. Can you name a case of legitimate speech that was blocked because it was called hate speech?. People in the U.K. have been arrested for burning the Quran. Why does anyone need to burn a Quran other than to send a message of hate to Muslims? I personally hate Christians, but I don't go around burning the New Testament.. You hate every single Christian? . Not the same guy, but I hate hate the fact that they're Christian about every single Christian.

He is from germany. Interestingly in my region we have several familys with the Name Trump. Even thoug his family was called Drumpf in germany . His family name was changed from Drumpf to Trump between 1618 and 1630. Its been Trump for 400 years.. Wait are we making fun of immigrants again? You're doing it, the president is doing it..  God damn Italians bringing pasta to this country. a LOT of italians came here illegally as stowaways and were accepted into american culture.. I mean, they were kind of the victims of the largest mass lynching in america. They weren't exactly accepted with open arms. . It's almost like history tells us that nationalism mixed with xenophobia is bad for those cast as 'outsiders' by it.  . Sounds like Fake History to me!

Yah but they're not from shithole countries..... ^^^/s. By Trump's definition they are, go to any large city in Canada and you'll see a lot of brown/asian faces. Asians are allowed. If there were this many Asians in the US as there are here (proportionally speaking), you'd have the alt right crying that they're destroying the country and that they shouldn't be allowed in. That's exactly who Steve Bannon was complaining about.

t3_7pthu3	0	*	Haiti ambassador: US official summoned to explain 'shithole' remark. So many people coming into these threads saying well I think it is a shithole.  No one gives a fuck what you think, you're not the president calling allies shitholes. post colonial independent nations. they fought for their countries freedom from a colonial power.... sounds familiar? . Haiti though actually gained its independence as a result of a slave revolt during the French Revolution.. That's actually a major reason it's so poor. After it gained independence pretty much every country refused to trade with it because they feared their slaves might try something similar.. How long has it been since slavery was banned in the US and Europe?. US? 1865  Europe varies wildly by country, and many continued to allow it in their colonies long after it was outlawed in the country proper.. So it's had quite a bit of time to build itself up.. It's not exactly that simple to completely turn things around after decades of crippling poverty.. They've had over 100 years since the thing you're talking about. Their gdp per capita is still $739 with no sign of improvement. It has nothing to do with that.

The UK has a shit voting system anyway so I wouldn't look too far into parliament seats. But that's beside the point. They don't have the right to hold one whether they want one or not.

Never noticed it on any other product though.. In the Midwest, a large sweet tea comes in a styrofoam cup. That and the breakfast plate are the only two things I can think of though.. Because the plastic makes tea taste terrible. . Ayyyye I learned something today, thanks stranger.. We gotta stop learning stuff just because someone said it on the internet. Though in this case he may not be wrong. . I dont think hes wrong because I have had sweet tea that tasted bad, and all of those times its been in plastic. I guess I just never put the two together.

I mean, Israel HAS offered to return them in peace deals IIRC. They were turned down. So no one but Israel even really claims them.. Bullshit, they never made any real offer, just like all their fake offers to Palestine that amount to nothing but trying to trick them into agreeing to give up. . Yes give up war and trying to murder israel. Seems like a reasonable thing. I know I would want you know peace in a peace deal..

So you lose access to benches when you lose your job?. When youre using it as your personal bedroom, yes.

Students on campus, they are where they are supposed to be. And homeless people are supposed to be where exactly? Somewhere you don't have to look at them? . In shelters?  In drug rehab programs?. Yes. Make those available instead of making benches unavailible.. cant shoot up heroin in a shelter unfortunately

We'll wait and see if the same can be said for Trump. I'm more interested in if the US exists and I wish Obama would have done something during 8 years of nuke testing.. Because nothing says: I want my country not to get nuked like starting a shooting war with China.. Who started a shooting war with China?. Anyone who decided to attack N. Korea. No not at all..

They make enough money that the investment was worth it. The debt still follows them and can cripple them, I mean partly because they typically will buy a house or buy high rent also, but yea it can be very difficult..

How are they fucked?  They chose to take a loan out to further their education and they pay it back.  Not the biggest deal, especially if you are successful .

Yeah, it kind of proves the republican point that stuff like this doesnt need government funding since volunteers and the private sector will take care of it if there is a big enough need.. Darn, those damn Republicans were right about something fuck how can we oppose the next Republican idea or value.. Republicans destroy something, volunteers restore less than 1%, see? who needs the government! . Kind of like the riots by liberals that destroyed people's livelihoods after Trump won the election?. what riots. https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2016/11/11/anti-trump-protesters-pepper-sprayed-demonstrations-erupt-across-us/93633154/. a few windows were smashed and a dumpster was lit on fire  it sounds more like the protest was more peaceful than riot, and a few individuals grabbed the chance to be violent 
t3_7u06hr	1	*	Big game hunter shot dead while hunting lions in Africa. 50/50 whether this thread decides Fuck him, he deserved it. Or The sale of hunting permits is essential to fund conservation.  Reddit being Reddit one will be correct and the other met with outrage.. I kinda agree with both though.. I'm a little from both as well, but people's refusal to understand the other frustrates me.. If you're for the conservation of animals I do not see how you could be against humane hunting practices.. Really? You don't see how people who love animals might be sad when animals are killed? You might not agree with them but surely you can see why they might feel like that?. Animals are killed constantly, in much more horrific and agonizing ways than a bullet through the heart.. So are people, but you wouldn't want to be shot either. That's true. But I'd rather be shot than have my guts ripped out by a bear while I'm alive and screaming and my parents and family are watching.. it's not one or the other, you know

Tampa FL. http://www.citycigarcompany.com/. https://cigarcitybrewing.com that's the one were talking about and he's 100% right.  If you ever find yourself in the area definitely go visit the brewery.. Looks good, thanks!

No no no, we don't stack vertically anymore. Bad stuff. We stack horizontally. So first, not top.. Genau, wir lxfcgen, NICHT Stehen! (Englishman who has just learned lay and stack in his lessons). lxfcgen is to lie as in telling a fib. Schade! Liegen?. That one's right. Ironic, since liegen is lying in Dutch.

Yes. 12 zeros. In one fucking year. . If it was to do things like infrastructure spending? I would be all for it.  But its not, its just a give away to people who already have everything. . Yeah but it'll trickle down because the rich people will want to then buy new bridges and pave major highways.  Yes it's /s, rich don't buy bridges and pave roads for the rest of us casuals.  . Mmmm, feel the trickling. Feel the warm, delicate trickling all over us plebeians.. Pretty sure that's piss.. Rupert Murdoch's salty, yellow piss.. No, they pay Russian prostitutes for that. . Thought they just snatched young orphan boys and had orgies?

t3_7zmu9h	0	*	Germany confirms $44.9 billion surplus and GDP growth in 2017. What will Germany do with that surplus?. give it to greece. That would only cover a fraction of what they owe Greece. We don't owe Greece anything. Yes, we do. . What do we owe them?. I think he's talking about payments for the destruction and robberies of WWII. Maybe Germany should demand reparations to Italy for the failed invasions of the Roman Emperors... . So if enough time goes by Greece's debt will be forgotten? 
t3_7zmu9h	1	*	Germany confirms $44.9 billion surplus and GDP growth in 2017. Also achieving almost 40 percent in renewable energy in a decade is a remarkable feat. Germany is doing great things and I like it. . They'll want to build a dome soon if the Atlantic Gulf Stream stops sending them that sweet sweet warmth. . Dont threaten German engineers with a good time. . They are all busy building an airport and a train station.... lol yeah the Berlin airport is definitely the most ungerman thing yet.. Most likely because it is being built in Berlin... which is like a giant pile of problems itself. It's built in Brandenburg, shut up. And I personally blame Dobrindt, he was minister of infrastructure and the airport belongs to Berlin, Brandenburg and the state.. I don't like Dobrint either but the BER was long gone before he came into office. . Yes the entire project became a parody of itself when they put that failure mehdorn in charge 
t3_7ygceg	1	*	Top U.S. officials tell the world to ignore Trumps tweets. Wasn't it confirmed just roughly half a year ago that Trump's tweets are offical presidential statements?.

Just cause he shits on gold doesn't make the shit itself gold.

Also, it changes based on the day. What he said yesterday may be official but could be just a casual locker room statement tomorrow if the situation changes.   . So, were *not* at war with Eurasia?. We never were. We're at war with East Asia. Always have been.. How about we just go to war with Allasia.. Why would we do that? Eurasia has always been our ally against East Asia. What about South Asia?  . Well that's the shit hole everyone fights over [silly](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/bb/1984_fictious_world_map_v2_quad.png)
t3_7ygceg	1	*	Top U.S. officials tell the world to ignore Trumps tweets. We were ignoring his tweets before he became the president of USA.  Then you guys made him your president.. 3 million more of us tried not to let this happen.   Edit: Seems I have pissed off some Trumpets and Russians. Sorry comrades. . And yet he's president. Your system *might* be flawed.. Astute observation. I don't know how I feel about other people attacking my freedoms. I'm gonna close my eyes and ears and start screaming the national anthem. /s. At least you guys have a catchy national anthem. I don't even know my countries anthem. I know our national animal is the Unicorn but that's about it..  Oh Flower of Scotland... how can you not know that? . My ears and brain abruptly shut down the second I hear bagpipes.. Not sure I've ever heard it with bagpipes, i might have blocked that out though
