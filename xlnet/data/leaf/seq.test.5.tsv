t1_durmt8u	1	*	Japan to pay travel costs for nuclear attack storytellers: The Japanese government will fund from April the travel costs of storytellers, both within Japan and abroad, who will share the testimonies given by ageing victims of Americas nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.. If China funds a Rape of Nanking storytelling, I will fully support it. . You know one atrocity doesn't cancel out another, right?. Right but they are spreading information about the atrocity they suffered while actively suppressing their brutalization of the Chinese.. Exactly. That was the point of my comment. Seems disingenuous for them to be publicizing this when they still deny that Nanking ever happened in spite of substantial documentation. 
t1_durvom2	1	*	Japan to pay travel costs for nuclear attack storytellers: The Japanese government will fund from April the travel costs of storytellers, both within Japan and abroad, who will share the testimonies given by ageing victims of Americas nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.. We dropped nuclear bombs right on top of innocent civilians. On purpose. Let that sink in for a while. Dont what about them, its civilians - just let it sink in. . They tortured, raped, and massacred civilians in mainland Asia, let that sink in.. The Japanese civilians did that?  The U.S. decided not to bomb a military base, they wanted to see what a nuke would do to a city full of innocent people.. Or we could have just fire bombed them like we had been doing and kill just as many, but loose some of our bombers in exchange...

Both stories should never be forgotten. . I'd rather be instantly vaporized than gang raped and murdered by having a bayonet shoved up my asshole.

Unpopular opinion (incoming downvotes): the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were far more humane than half of the acts committed by Japan in WWII.. Unpopular opinion: civilian massacres were great because it was against a country whose army was bad. (Sitting at 13 upvotes). You have terrible reading comprehension.

K abe. What does that have anything to do with this?. Reminding people why the bombs were used, instead of acting like they were some sort of out of nowhere atrocity.. You think the bombs were used because of China and Korea? 0o

Trump supporter here, what charities do you think will be most helpful?. What the fuck are you talking about? Isn't the post referring to the earthquake guy?  Amazing. Just like Trump, his supporters think it's all about him. . At least he's planning on donating to a helpful charity, considering it's a quake in Mexico.

Are they designed to fail?. Have you ever heard of the centennial light bulb? How is that thing still going?. It gives off about as much light as a candle, and light bulbs are most likely to burn out when you turn them on. That light bulb has basically never been turned off and on.

t1_duzg5mg	0	*	Afghan President Ashraf Ghani offered recognition of Taliban insurgents as a legitimate political group on Wednesday as part of a proposed political process that could lead to talks aimed at ending more than 16 years of war.. It's a rather mature decision to take. Imagine how hard it must be knowing that those people killed your loved ones but you still have to work with them to prevent future bloodshed. . This.   It's extremely hard to not take the eye for an eye approach. We in the US haven't taken this approach since basically our inception.. No, the US immediately set to rebuilding their vanquished foes after WW2.. Who have we ever rebuilt lol?  We don't even rebuild PR, which is our own fucking land.

t1_dsu6squ	1	*	Trumps tax plan brings back billions in overseas money from Apple.. Was it the tax reform though or the fact that they're taking a hit for repeatedly lying about their use of offshore tax havens?. Yeah, obviously the fact that they get to keep 14% more of it has *absolutely nothing* to do with the decision. /s  Give me a break.. I didn't say it had *nothing* to do with the decision, but at the same time I'm not in the camp that it's entirely to do with tax reform either.. Ahhh. Well that I can agree with. Ofc there are other reasons, like how they're betting the Dems take the House and Senate back and overturn the reforms.

t1_dtbqf43	1	*	Marijuana should be legalized in two of Mexicos main tourist hot spots, Cancun and Los Cabos, in order to reduce criminal violence, Mexicos minister for tourism said on Thursday..

[73% of mexicans are against it.](http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/articulo/english/2015/11/19/73-mexicans-reject-marijuana-legalization-survey). That's pretty damning. Didn't know there was such a strong stigma.. This is a very conservative country, I'm in fact quite surprised 30% are in favor

Sean Hannity - on TV regarding the Mueller revelations last week... Id say more but heres a video of a [chimpanzee riding on a Segway](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=NPGUIpv-JxI).

I don't think any actor or director will ever be able to show Trump accurately.. He'll play himself after the presidency. . He's playing himself right now.
t1_dtf0gwa	0	*	Trump campaign aide Carter Page may have been a Russian agent, a secret memo reveals. I thought the Russians approached him but he was too stupid to pick up on their hints and they decided he wasn't smart enough to accomplish anything for them? . > they decided he wasn't smart enough to accomplish anything  pretty sure they're realizing that about Trump now too. Well, we *are* having this conversation, and more. The Russians got everything they wanted, at budget cost.. The US president is increasing sanctions against Russia, I highly doubt they wanted that.
t1_dsnrdea	0	*	A strike by the Israeli Air Force on Saturday night destroyed a 180 meter long terror tunnel below the Gaza Strip, the IDF spokesperson confirmed on Sunday morning. Lolol he said terror tunnel. OOooooO scary. I guess anything and everything is justified as long as you add the word terror.. It's used by Hamas to smuggle weapons and fighters in. What do you want, exactly?. So its a tunnel..... Used by terrorist organisations. What exactly is the problem with calling it a 'terror tunnel'? 
t1_dt2u0vq	1	*	Kim Dotcom sues the New Zealand government for $6.8 billion. 6.8 billion is probably too much. what was he worth before the government of NZ let a foreign government seize his shit without a warrant and evidence?  maybe bring it down to like 1 or 2 billion.. You always start with a ridiculously high number so when it inevitably gets reduced it's closer to what you actually wanted.. yea that's true. i wasn't sure if that's something people do in court cases though, but makes sense.. He'd probably settle for some scratch off lottery tickets, a pack of cigarettes and a quart of beer.

Yes, 2018.. where you cant where a Mexican costume to a costume party because of cultural appropriation but an entire country is allowed to steal a neighbours name and cultural identity? . are you implying that Macedonia is effectively dressing up in a greek costume? . Im sorry I dont understand. Macedonia is Greek, so I guess whatever local costume they wear would be a Greek costume. 
t1_dt7rs65	0	*	Twelve camels have been disqualified from Saudi Arabia's annual camel beauty contest because their owners resorted to giving them botox injections.. I have no idea that camel beauty contest is a thing... and holy shit, the quality of these camels must be really high for the owners to resort to botox injection to win this competition.. I'd imagine a dog show's not much different. I'd hope, if I ever stuck my dog with botox for a show, that he'd bite my ass. . [Well they do this to them.](http://0.lushome.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/butterfly-decoration-dog-grooming-service.jpg)   Personally I'd think that deserves several bites, so yeah.. Yeah. I mean thats stupid and all but it didnt physically harm the animal unnecessarily like giving it Botox injections. 
t1_ds65ivp	1	*	North Korea calls hotline to South Korea in major diplomatic move. Think Un wants to unify the Korea's but retain his power?. That is not new. The Kims always wanted to re-unify Korea.. I'm assuming only under their rule.. Well that goes without saying.

More like Keine Schwarzen Essen. * kein Schwarzes Essen? richtig?. Depends on what they meant. No black food or No food for blacks.. Without punctuation and with every word capitalized, I read that as Don't eat blacks.

Holy shit who's the insensitive ass that actually went and nicknamed them 'womb raider'. It's the daily mail. Need i say more?. This is just so indicative of the times we live in now. Catchy headlines are valued above all else. . True, but the Daily Mail is a special kind of low - always probing the depths to see what new lows can be uncovered. The worst kind of pioneers.
t1_ds1dx93	0	*	Nuclear war with North Korea is closer than ever, says former US military chief. Funny that half a dozen other articles are discussing the thaw in tensions..... Because americans are disgusting war mongers. Theyve killed a few hundred thousand civilians and wonder why they have a terrorism problem.. Nobody ever calls Germany that. They literally started two world wars in almost modern times and killed tens of millions of people. Selective amnesia I guess.. If you read a history book youll find the US as guilty of the same atrocities as nazi Germany. 
t1_dsp5mk3	1	*	U.S. set to cut U.N. money for Palestinian refugees.. I would feel free to assume the US will not be ponying up for anything under the current administration.  Dear UN, NATO, etc.: We got our own billionaires to feed.. What's wrong with letting a country keep more of it's money?. If only Americans actually kept that money, instead of Trump funnelling money to rich elites and his own wallet.. Well maybe if we elected govt officials that shrunk the deficit through a reduction of the federal government as well as massive income tax cuts.

Time it and let us know. Release an edit if you want.
t1_du4apmd	1	*	NBC apologizes to Koreans for Olympics coverage that praised Japans brutal occupation. in actuality, japanese culture is based off of korea, almost entirely (baekje culture). There is this strange ironic feeling when modern Japan happens to be more traditionally Korean than modern Korea.. thats because when japan occupied korea, they looted most korean treasures, and destroyed records. rebranding many as japanese. a ton of artifacts (statues, swords) are actually korean. I'm talking about the Baekjae era.

Not the glorified babysitters that they are. Dressing it up with gender politics doesn't make it any more legitimate. . Glorified babysitters? I hope you get the uneducated person you're imagining when your children are at childcare.. Most places in the US dont even require a high school degree to be a child care worker.  Its not as good as a babysitter.. You would be incredibly wrong if you assumed all or even a majority of childcare workers are like the ones you described.  Some centers you find may be glorified babysitters but many are not.

Just listen to the scientists if you want to know if it is real. I don't know what you mean by, the biggest people against it are its biggest causes. You mean like the united States?

How long would it take for the oceans to be repopulated to the levels we want?. Give it a couple of months, nature is nuts. If only that was true.. It was true during WWII. During the war, fishing was pretty much shut down due to Naval movements, and when it restarted it was like the ocean had reset.

The term marks implies that the situation has just recently happened. The term marked would make more sense for an event that occurred roughly a year ago. . News is usually almost always written in present tense.

t1_du8oj87	1	*	New Dutch law makes every adult an organ donor. Netherlands narrowly passed new legislation on that will register every citizen aged 18 and over as a potential organ donor, unless they explicitly choose to opt out.. Why is this controversial? Before, everyone has a choice. Now, everyone has a choice. It really doesn't matter what the default is -- if you care strongly one way or the other then you can switch.. Because your body SHOULD belong to you, not the government. They are making a decision for the Dutch subject's body.. Before this decision, the Dutch government made a decision as well -- to prevent the donation from the (former) subject's body unless they had expressed otherwise. .

Good, let us know where you are buried when you die so we can dig up your grave and take off your wasted clothing and jewelry.  In fact, giving you a casket is a waste of good wood and upholstery. Sure, I'll give you a call when I'm dead. I don't need those clothes anyway and if it makes you happy and warm be my guest.

Why, did you have plans for your liver after you've passed away?. Yes, its being donated. What Im saying is its a little presumptuous of the Danish government to just help themselves to said liver. . Danish? It's about The Netherlands, not Denmark

If everyone's a donor then no one is a target . you do know, the organs are degrading fast once you die right? even for donor purposes its in the doctors, nurses and caretakers BEST interest too keep you alive..

I own my body, the government does not. . > I own my body, the government does not.   where's that written down? as far as i know there is no law, nor human right that says so..

Can't this fear be eliminated by simply keeping your donor status private until you are pronounced dead?. There can also be a plethora of valid medical reasons, not just personal choice, I think? Im certain theres tons of diseases that disqualify you as a donor.. There is more than one organ. You may have bad kidneys but a heart that functions perfectly.

Netherlands narrowly passed new legislation on that will register every citizen aged 18 and over as a potential organ donor, unless they explicitly choose to opt out.. I thought donating was supposed to be voluntary. . It is, if you can freely opt out. People are lazy, this just prevents laziness from depriving someone of life. Your wishes as the donor (or not) are still respected.. Yet you automatically put into the program. Lack of opposition does not equal consent. Could've sworn we already knew that. . It isn't required, not a single person will be forced into donating by a default selection that favors life.  This policy is morally right, because it defaults to valuing life.

t1_du8kj9h	1	*	New Dutch law makes every adult an organ donor. Netherlands narrowly passed new legislation on that will register every citizen aged 18 and over as a potential organ donor, unless they explicitly choose to opt out.. I view this as a good thing. People here seem to think you won't get very good surgeons and nurses if you're a donor and they'll just let you die. If everyone's a donor then no one is a target . I'm more afraid of being killed by a millionaire's minions after finding I'm the only viable donor for his rare condition.   . Unless you live in some sort of TV show that is not something you should ever be afraid about.. > Unless you live in some sort of TV show  Or China.

Ive only ever heard of this for specific autism cases and Ive taught SpEd sections of HS science for 5 years. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24581401  I know locally, several kids that use them specifically for ADHD, not ASD.. But stimming like this is a classic ASD symptom. So Id start looking at individual diagnosis more closely or rethinking what ADHD actually is.

Let me give you an example: you get called a whore from across the street because you're wearing a miniskirt, that's a lewd comment. Welcome to Paris.

If you are a bad looking guy, then learn to shut up or get fined.  . Insert if Clarence Thomas looked like Denzel Washington joke. You stop that Denzel!  With yo fine self.  Mm

Part-time people don't. . Well then i stand corrected. Everyone i spoke to has never even heard of benefits being offered there. I used to work there, alot of my friends too and nothing. . To be fair, the benefits sucked and my son was still under my insurance. He took the cash payout instead which was like $150 per year or something.

Tim Hortons made almost $100 000 000 in Q3 2017. They are doing fine. They can afford the $8 extra an hour to staff the place. . You are confusing the corporation with a franchisee owner. Try to learn the difference. . I know the difference,  but profit is profit. You on the other hand are mistaking actual people for profits.

There was an uproar! . Im not American and I want Obama back. He was absolute class.. This just in: merit doesn't qualify you for a position, but if you're nice and kiss everyones' asses it's better. Donald Trump is an idiot and a terrible world leader. 
t1_dsm86y2	1	*	Before shithole comment, Trump asked why a pretty Korean lady wasn't negotiating with Kim Jong Un on his behalf. Guys, are we the shithole country?

t1_dslwuf1	1	*	Before shithole comment, Trump asked why a pretty Korean lady wasn't negotiating with Kim Jong Un on his behalf. I think he's joking because kim jong un is a fat gross dude.. So he was projecting again?. You're delusional.. Thats hilarious coming from a red hat
t1_dslwzgi	0	*	Before shithole comment, Trump asked why a pretty Korean lady wasn't negotiating with Kim Jong Un on his behalf. Why is this news worthy?. Because if almost any other national official would have said something as batshit crazy as this, it would probably be career ruining. . I mean if anything, it's derogatory towards KJU. It infers that he's a desperate, gross old man that'd be more apt to talk with a cute girl than an actual diplomat.. Imply vs Infer 
t1_dsm183v	1	*	Before shithole comment, Trump asked why a pretty Korean lady wasn't negotiating with Kim Jong Un on his behalf. This guy has literally antagonized every group of people who aren't white, and to be even more specific, white males. *facepalm*. To be even more specific, white males with no moral conscious.. Lol. I work at an animal hospital with 12 women and 11 of them voted Trump. You people will say anything to confirm your own biased. And we all celebrated on that glorious morning too . Congrats for working with a bunch of retards I guess

When Obama put dijon on that burger it literally killed me. I'm dead now. That was so irresponsible and heartless of him.. Right, the nerve of that Kenyan, with his fancy mustard. Thank god we can put ketchup on a shitty steak again. These are truly heady times.

Whoever the next president is , they are lucky the bar is set so fuckin low . Kanyes time to shine.. Kayne would be worse than Trump. He once said that his biggest regret is not being able to listen to his music live.  The last time a man had this much ego he was the Fxfchrer of Germany.. It's just a joke. The whole Kanye 2020 meme.

Oh really ok i never actually watched the show yet I just saw the trailer and found it incredible.
t1_dudr378	1	*	Painkiller that once cost $138 is now $2,979. I thought costs were supposed to go down as they paid of the research and learned to make it more efficiently, right? .

t1_dudsygm	1	*	Painkiller that once cost $138 is now $2,979. 2,158.7% increase in price. Cause apparently people don't make enough money.. I guess Shkreli made an impression.. Except he was supposed to be making a point. No one listened, and here we are. . That's the altruism he mentioned
t1_duds62i	0	*	Painkiller that once cost $138 is now $2,979.  the freer the market the freer the people . You're not entitled to a company's medicine.  . Why are they entitled to government protection of their medicine if they're going to use that to abuse people?  . They arent.
t1_due59di	1	*	Painkiller that once cost $138 is now $2,979. It's not just painkillers, we just paid $2500 for a medicine that my wife could die without. Hooray for American healthcare. In Germany it would be $3-5 recipe fee completely independent of how expensive the medicine is. And even that fee is capped for chronic illnesses.. In France it would be free.. Yeah, thanks guys, we know.  Why don't you let all us US healthcare victims emigrate to the EU? Return the favor of Ellis Island etc.. 
t1_dudscpc	1	*	Painkiller that once cost $138 is now $2,979.  the freer the market the freer the people . The pharma and health care industries are the least free market in america.  Why don't grocery stores just triple their prices if they want to make more money?  You'd think they want to, right?  . Not really. America doesn't actually have a free  market.  Not in most industries anyways, definitely not in pharma. . That's literally what I said.

t1_dt3e5vf	0	*	Israeli rabbis say they'll hide African asylum seekers in their homes, to protect them from a new Israeli immigration policy.. Cher said this too, but she didn't follow through and she's glad everybody forgot about it. That's what I would want the world to believe if I was hiding a basement full of people.. Then why would you announce it on twitter and in a bunch of magazine interviews that you're about to start doing it?. To find people to hide of course!
t1_dtacuvm	0	*	Boos as Donald Trump attacks 'fake' media during Davos speech. I think they were saying, 'Boo-urns, Boo-urns.. I was saying boo-urns sir . It's actually Moleman saying it, not Smithers so there's no sir. I kinda remembered but it was way after and I lack the wherewithal to defend myself 
t1_dtaegcz	0	*	Boos as Donald Trump attacks 'fake' media during Davos speech. Journalists were booing the president as the president indicated that journalists were biased.  Interesting.. Saying fake news is accusing someone of lying, not accusing someone of being biased.. If only the two were mutually exclusive. . You can be biased without lying

I doubt it, but can a Dutch verify my suspicion?. The Dutch have a no bullshit approach to things. It's lovely and slightly unnerving at the same time. . Sounds refreshing and not one bit unnerving to my American ears, so to speak.. It can be perceived as rude by cultures are are used to more beating around the bush, but I wouldn't want it any other way myself.
t1_dsjbauz	1	*	'This is the Netherlands, you have to answer questions': Dutch reporters confront new US envoy. The Dutch should just expel him from the country already. . For what?.

t1_duli4nu	1	*	Russian bots on Twitter are sowing discord using the gun control debate. It's amazing, turns out the cold war was a waste of time and money. All Russia needed some memes and fake profiles on Twitter and America is tearing itself apart.. Hilarious to watch isn't it? If Russian's chatting shit online is all that takes to destabilize American then I really think there's a bigger issue . The IQ numbers in this country have been dropping like a rock.   The Republicans war on education is working. . Lmfao
t1_dulk8yt	0	*	Russian bots on Twitter are sowing discord using the gun control debate. It's amazing, turns out the cold war was a waste of time and money. All Russia needed some memes and fake profiles on Twitter and America is tearing itself apart.. Russians also tried disinformation warfare during the cold war. The reason why its so effective today is internet social media giving the Russians direct access to the American psyche. . And then the overreaction: everyone who disagrees with me is a bot  They really have it awesomely done to both sides  . > They really have it awesomely done to both sides   Which frustrates those in the middle to no end. It's like holding back two siblings fighting over who took the last hamburger.
t1_dulhnpr	1	*	Russian bots on Twitter are sowing discord using the gun control debate. I did a Turing Test on my best friend the other day, turns out he was a Russian bot all along! DAMN YOU TUUUURING! DAMN YOU TO HELL!!!. You, I like you.. You, I dislike you.. Nothing hurts more than dislike from a complete stranger. Right in the feels... Have you seen ex machina.

All Russia needed some memes and fake profiles on Twitter and America is tearing itself apart.. Russians also tried disinformation warfare during the cold war. The reason why its so effective today is internet social media giving the Russians direct access to the American psyche. . And it's not that all these conflicts didn't exist before. The Russians are just creating sparks in what is already a bakery full of flour dust.. They can also reach a ton of people very cheaply, and drive them to extremes. I remember how bitter the primaries got between liberals and slightly more liberals. 
t1_dtw507o	1	*	Man jailed over sibling sex act viral video con. That title is a rollercoster. It's as if a random word generator just stuck a load of words together to make a sentence. Not really.

The rotting fruit is estimated to be worth A$300,000 to the local economy.. Someone truck in 80,000 pizzas, stat.. Aussies put pineapple on burgers, usually along with beetroot.... Pineapples on burgers are amazing. Those and fried eggs (not necessarily together) are freakin game changers.. I'll eat pineapple on a burger, but I'll never eat it on pizza.
t1_dsk13bj	1	*	Nearly 100 tonnes of pineapples are currently rotting in Australian fields due to a disagreement between Queensland farmers and a multinational producer.

t1_du51yn3	0	*	CEOs make $15.6 million on averageheres how much their pay has increased compared to yours over the year. I don't get it. If you hate it so much, why don't you become a CEO yourself? And before downvoting me, reread my comment and try to understand what you just read.  Also, how is this worldnews?. No, you see, these people couldn't even begin to imagine working as hard as these CEO's work. They just want them to give them money while they sit on their asses pursuing their Hobbies. . Yes golfing all day and doing hookers and blow all night is hard.. I suppose it's okay for you to have days off and indulge in recreation because you're poor, right? 
t1_dtbetqk	1	*	Israeli Holocaust survivors are pleading with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to cancel his plan to forcefully expel tens of thousands of African migrants, citing their own experiences as outcasts.

t1_dtbfbfs	1	*	Israeli Holocaust survivors are pleading with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to cancel his plan to forcefully expel tens of thousands of African migrants, citing their own experiences as outcasts. Israel has granted permanent residence to people from Darfur, they will not be deported. The rest are nothing but economic migrants and too bad those Holocaust survivors were tricked into this. Don't know much about Eritrea, do you?. I do, I know multiple Eritreans now living happily in Ethiopia.. Cool?

I am not conducting an investigation, however the ones that are have all they need. lol
t1_dsqked0	1	*	Hijab attack on girl was a hoax - Canada. Democrats and Liberals always making up stories. That's how we know the 11 year old was a democrat liberal.  She made up the story, therefore she's a liberal.  Logic 101.. Maybe she was influenced by someone with an agenda.. Maybe X is true, therefore X is true.  Logic 102.
t1_dsq6hge	0	*	Hijab attack on girl was a hoax - Canada. I wouldnt be surprised if the story was deliberately made up just so they can accuse someone of 'islamophobia'. Happens far too often. . Does it? Seems pretty uncommon to me.. I'm certain there are other hoaxes (which i don't think is necessarily the right word) that we don't know about. Either because nobody found out for sure, or it wasn't widely reported. 
t1_dsqf7q8	0	*	Hijab attack on girl was a hoax - Canada. It's almost like waiting until all the facts are in before causing mass hysteria would help both sides. . Ahmed and the clock scandal come to mind. Ahmed was later pictured with and congratulated by a wanted terrorist. . Liar.
t1_dsq9l5a	0	*	Hijab attack on girl was a hoax - Canada. Damage is done and our PM who was quick to use this for PR will probably not talk about the damage this incident has caused and how these fake hate crimes are damaging to real victim's.. No real damage was done other than some wasted police resources investigating this.  If there is any evidence of adults involved in this they would be charged with public mischief.  . > No real damage was done  You underestimate the power the Canadian PM spreading LIES on National TV can have on racial and political tensions.. You don't understand the definition of a LIE.
t1_dsq3tdf	1	*	Hijab attack on girl was a hoax - Canada. She and her family should face some consequences. Wasting police time like that.. She and her family should face deportation. Hahahaha. Back to where? Canada?

You and 950+ people have reclaimed my hope for this website. . the story fit all the narratives for a good old fashioned case of outrage. Initially I was one of those people but the more I read into it the less sympathetic I became
t1_dsqbqtk	0	*	Hijab attack on girl was a hoax - Canada. I wouldnt be surprised if the story was deliberately made up just so they can accuse someone of 'islamophobia'. Almost definitely. This seems a lot like Ahmed and his clock. Sucks that some people are like this.. Except this was made up by an eleven year old girl. I think it's pretty obvious that she was just looking for attention, and not part of some political conspiracy.. >  she was just looking for attention,   Or get away from it, ie explaining why she wasn't wearing it.

t1_dsqb7za	1	*	Hijab attack on girl was a hoax - Canada. Why lie? Why exacerbate issues and make the divide even bigger?  This isnt the right way to draw attention to your cause, let alone anything. Just giving your opponents more reasons to cry foul. Dumb.. She's 11 lol.. And? At that point you should know theres consequences for what you say. . And you're right, she shouldn't have and will face consequences.  Doesn't mean she did it for religious reasons, on some mission for Muslim sympathy lol.
t1_dsq600i	1	*	Hijab attack on girl was a hoax - Canada. Of course it was. Perpetual victims often make up abuse so people feel sorry for them.. Are you calling an 11 year old girl a perpetual victim?. Probably her parents who orchestrated it.. Have you ever considered the fact that 11 year olds lie for attention?

t1_dsq5ycp	1	*	Hijab attack on girl was a hoax - Canada. This doesn't explain why they think it didn't happen. Is it just they don't believe the girl? . The area is also covered in cameras, if it had happened one of them would have picked it up. The kid just made shit up for whatever reason, maybe they just didn't want to goto school.. Yea fair enough. I'm sure they know. I'm just saying a mention of how they know would've been good. . It's fine it's just not America so people don't assume they got cameras everywhere yet.

t1_ds6yq14	1	*	Nikki Haley: Pakistan playing 'double game' for years. They work with us at times, and they also harbour the terrorists that attack our troops in Afghanistan, Haley told reporters at UN headquarters. That game is not acceptable to this administration.. Ask her about Saudi Arabia and what she plans to do about 15 hijackers coming from there out of 19 on 9/11. Isnt Saudi Arabia purging already?  The whole royal family wasnt responsible for it, its always been believed that certain parts of the family have been funding Wahhabism . The only thing Saudi Arabia is purging is political rivals. It's still a terrorist state.. Well some of the political rivals being purged, mainly Al-Waleed bin Talal, were the ones thought to be the main driving force of sponsored terrorism and the push for Wahhabism throughout the world.

Not as long as world renowned lizard person, and proud destroyer of physical hearts, and owner of one that's not his own, Dick Cheney has any say in the matter.. Not as long as 90% of Americans use gas or diesel powered vehicles, either.. Yes global warming is only an American problem.

This is basically blaming people for not wanting to live in a tiny apartment with multiple people so they can afford living in a city with good transit.. That's some twisted logic you got there haha.

Boo-boo, look a billionaire died. Apparently his life was way more important because he had money in the bank and bribes Trudeau every now and then..

We make 160k a year and drive 10 year old used Toyotas. If you think making 200k a year with a kid and a house by a major city gives you new Mercedes money you are living in a dream world.

t1_dui8wkv	0	*	Gates says billionaires should pay 'significantly' more taxes. I don't get why it can't be a flat percentage.

Why not make it 0% then?. Then the government has no money and we have no police, military, public schooling, etc.

My point is that this type of ideology exists in high places in western countries too. It just so happens that Indonesia has a number of hardline Muslims in government.

Keep believing that U.S. propaganda as if Americans didn't voluntarily reject the Establishment and corrupt Hillary.  . What the fuck does Hillary have to do with this?.

This got me thinking, can't people just buy a human one from a Sex Shop and then put it on their dog?. Well yeah, but if they were caught they would be penalized by the law and be know as that person who technically used a sex toy on their dog.

t1_dung31v	0	*	Japan likely to exceed quota of the endangered Blue Fin Tuna for 2nd year. Are the people unaware their eating an endangered species?  I find it hard to believe that one of the most intelligent cultures is doing this.. You see the glossy developed part of the country not it as a whole.. I mean, the whole country is developed, that doesn't mean there aren't japans version of redneck hicks out in the Japanese boonies, but its a well developed industrial nation. . It's not redneck hicks that are eating bluefin tuna. Just the opposite.
t1_dtdkn5x	1	*	Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny detained by police at Moscow rally (Navalny on Twitter). I'm very interested in seeing how we will look back on Russia and Putin in 50 years. It doesn't seem like anything is changing dispite the crazy stories coming from there.. Putin will die (or become weak and be imprisoned) and the ensuing power struggle will ruin the country again.. Yes, he ensured he has no successor, setting up a colossal power struggle once he's gone.. As long as whoever ends up succeeding him is smart enough to keep Surkov around, I'm not so sure.

I think Gay is actually illegal in Russia.

t1_dtfiqpp	1	*	Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny detained by police at Moscow rally (Navalny on Twitter). The opposition leader to Putin. I wonder who had him detained. What a great strong leader putin is.... Putin makes him a criminal by changing laws so certain things Navalny has done in protest will end up disqualifying him as a candidate. Putin is a little bitch . The important part is has done. I'm not well informed about the matter, but if that's true WTF happened to the concept of nulla poena sine lege???. The same thing that happened to the concept of democracy? Russia ignores it.

Those stream revenues aren't coming in. Ppl are using fb less and less. . By the way, not everyone can get the ability to just short a stock. You need to pretty much be an institutional asset manager or somehow you convince someone to lend you their stock.   . It's called a broker. You don't need to be affiliated with an institution.

Hopefully they can abandon the nuclear program and start looking at peace. . They wont abandon it because theyve seen how the US overthrows nations that have done so or didnt have nukes to begin with.. They are going to need a hundred nukes before USA backs down.

This is good. If more academics, doctors, nurses and essential workers up and leave now, it might be the kick in the arse the government needs to abandon this foolish and reckless course.. Remeber: it's not actually the government that chose the foolish and reckless course.. Except that it did, since the referendum was NON-binding.. A democracy can not ignore a referendum.

Zimbabwe didn't have a powerful business community and civil society that could stand up to Mugabe. SA does.. Rhodesia did, Mugabe crushed it with the help of the Western powers.   Just because there's strength doesn't mean that ruthless attacks at the top can be stopped. . Well moreso the indifference of the West and the active help of the Communist powers.

t1_dto3h64	1	*	Indian education minister dismisses theory of evolution because no-one 'ever saw an ape turning into a man'. It really pisses me off when they do not even understand evolution.   We didn't evolve from apes.  We share a common ancestor.. Not only did we evolve from apes, we still are apes ourselves. We just didn't evolve from the other apes alive today, which is what you probably meant.. Yes, thank you.  Apes alive today share an ancestor with the apes that we evolved from.  Is that more correct?. Yes, this is probably the most important point to make, since a lot of people are convinced evolution is trying to tell them we came from chimpanzees they see in zoos.

It does seem quite odd that they would only grant JW's the right to avoid conscription. They need to expand the exemption to other conscientious objectors. .  from my very limited understanding, the JWs are pacifists and object to all violence. . plenty of jobs they can do.   be a medic.  drive a truck.  be a cook (not the steven seagal kind).. That's already what the US does with contentious objectors. You don't escape being drafted, you just get a desk job.

Mostly that Hillary would win easily so people didn't turn out to vote combined with ridiculous levels of gerrymandering and a broken end antiquated electoral college system. . don't forget targeted Russian ads with lies in battleground states.

Even if 80,000 people were the swing in the swing states, many millions voted both way. People need to stop whining and instead focus on a candidate to put up against trump. . I agree in part, but it *is* a problem, as the swing-states are won by the candidate who can bullshit to appease them. It's not a system that promotes what's best for the country.

I guess we have to ban twitter, because those dirty Russians can sway an election with just 500,000 retweets!. Banning is not the point, having a open discussion about it is.

So, Is this a replacement for lifeguards?. Well someone would have to retrieve them... so I guess while this drone was dispatches someone else was readying a boat or jet ski for a actual pickup... or maybe they just floated away?! :). Transponders on the beach, a small motor and a homing device on the pod and it can come in on its own. I imagine someone is working on such a thing  now..

Nor do they bother to mention that it was financed by the DNC and the Hillary campaign.. Sorry, but what evidence do you have that a decorated and trusted spy, Christopher Steele, wrote a 'total and complete fabrication'? Please provide it.. Perhaps the fact that none of the claims in the dossier have been substantiated as fact. . So since you, internet rando, are not personally aware of any evidence that substantiates the claims in the dossier, the entire thing is fabricated bullshit? K bud.

Nobody in the region supports Kurds: Turkey, Syria, Iraq (Sunni), Iraq (Shia), Free Syrian Army, Iran.  The enemy of my enemy is still my enemy.. Maybe it's because Kurdish ethnic nationalism is intertwined with separatism, and thus they are hostile to the countries they live in and want to change the status quo.     It's a two-sided issue. . Maybe the Kurds are fed up by the hundreds of years of oppression that they suffered under Arabs,Turks and Persians.. Maybe they should've got a country when they were able to. It's too late now. They can try to steal some lands from other people, they will fail.

t1_ds65f9t	1	*	After missing Model 3 deliveries by 87% in Q3, Tesla have now missed their already halved Q4 production goals by another 47% - Back in July, Elon Musk said Tesla would be able to produce 20,000 Model 3s per month by December 2017, but it produced just 2,425 during the whole quarter. It's important in any business to set goals and aim high, otherwise I don't think Tesla would still be here.. Eventually, investors will catch on and determine that you're full of shit and then good luck raising capital through bonds.. Uber?. That ride, so to speak, will end soon enough. The only way to really make money in that industry is to manufacture scarcity through heavy regulation and monopoly power.

On the plus side, at least they aren't rushing it and churning out garbage. . We have no evidence of that.. Model S and X? . Hot garbage, especially in the early months.  Doors that don't work, and a drivetrain failure so bad they couldn't build the replacements fast enough...  These are the legacy left by those models.

Turns out shit is harder than it looks. Every company I've ever worked for in an engineering capacity has done the same thing over and over again.. MBAs doing what they do best!. Musk is an MBA? . No, but he did go to Wharton business school (Bachelor of science in economics). Same degree and school as Trump. Musk also has a degree in physics.

USA is close friends with South Korea and it would push more USA power to the Border of China.  If anybody wouldn't want this it would be China.  . North/South Korea wants the USA out. China wants the USA out. Russia wants the USA out. A unified Korea is no friendly to the US and it's imperialism.. South Korea is a close ally to the United States...

What about the UN? . No green card there

It really does feel like the US and other world powers will dump the Kurds at a moments notice if someone tells them too. Today it is Turkey, yesterday it was Saddam. . Tools are meant to be used and then discarded when they no longer serve a purpose. When you willingly become someone's tool, you should not be surprised with the outcome. .

That law wasnt even put in place until 1947. Somewhat recent and after World War 2.      Senators and House members can stay in as long as they keep getting elected and no one is batting an eye. . Exactly. A US sensor or Congressman is one of the most powerful people on Earth yet they can stay in power for decades relatively unknown to most people. Crazy .

My mom is in Kabul right now and always tells me that the number reported deaths are way Lower and she says close to double that are dead. And I'm just telling her to get the hell out of there.  . Why she there in the first place. Trying to sell her childhood home. . How does she get around without either her father or your father escorting her?  How much can a home in Afghanistan go for to make any of that worthwhile?

An important detail.. Why is it important? She *is* a German national. . Born germans usually don't join a religious fanatic group to fight in another country.. Again, why does it matter where the person is from? She's a fanatic that made a very stupid decision and is now paying the price.

We get earthquakes here in NH sometimes, since technically we're still geologically active. Usually just feels like a train or large truck going by.. I'm from Pennsylvania. When I felt an earthquake, I thought it was the downforce from helicopters since that was the last cause of my whole house shaking.

Thats for me to decide. This is absolutely censorship by raw definition! . Then I don't think you've read the article or understand what it is they are talking about.

Threats have to have strength and authority behind them to mean something, and you have neither.. The last time Canada threatened Facebook, Facebook caved. Canadian privacy laws demanded that Facebook have better privacy options. Facebook had to redevelop their privacy system as a response.. But was it Cuckdough that threatened them?. No, but he's much better at it than Harper was.

Reddits humility is trending downwards and has been for years. It's salvageable but I'm not sure how. More comments like this might help. Are you joking? Any comment that suggests reddit is full of fat/ugly/stupid/lonely people instantly gets +1 million votes.. Tendencies towards self-deprecation of internal culture are different from the ability to conduct humility of beliefs.

Realistically ExxonMobil has the resources to out compete any renewable startup. Big oil today will be the big Green of tomorrow with only a few casualties.. Also, oil is used for far more than energy. Oil is going nowhere. Hopefully extraction gets more responsible, but we will be drilling for oil for a long time.. Isn't oil not used for energy effectively subsidised by oil for fuel?   The main reason to drill is for fuel, but that comes with other stuff that might as well be sold.

Do we have a follow-up tweet yet with the cheeto declaring either 1) Fake News, 2) Witchhunt, or 3) Gates was untrustworthy and he never liked the guy?  Bonus points if it ends with very sad.

Not necessarily but for treason we hang people. Last to be hanged were that married couple spying for russia 40 years ago though so it doesn't go that far often. .

It means he had a man work for him that may have committed tax evasion in 2013. Is it anything that could come back to hurt trump? Like could this be used for impeachment? . It could be looked at like a bad hire.  Something like this could never lead to impeachment.  I doubt even CNN could put that spin on it.

They are vaccinating most of their children and it stops HPV which doesn't mean all possible cervical cancers.  EDIT: Or even all strains of HPV. Sure, but that'll still take care of about 91% of cervical cancers.. Are they vaccinating men, too? Does HPV cause testicle cancer? I dont think men can get cervical cancer..

Because I'd rather have my tax dollars go to their sex ed, contraception, voluntary sterilization, and abortion than face a gigantic immigration problem 20 years down the road.. Ok currently we are having no impact on their birth rates and we will already have to face an immigration problem down the road. . we literally have helped lower the African birth rate by over a third in a generation.

Verona is one of the most far right city in Italy, downright fascist tbh. Sucks.. Shit I'm coloured and I went to see my ex there many times.

He just announced the Fake Media Awards, [almost verbatim](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/948359545767841792). I think we definitely lost him. . Is it bad that the only thing that really shocks me is the redundance of 5:00 o'clock? . God damn.  He couldn't be more Christian if he was Jesus himself.  What a stupid fuck
t1_ds5ptfz	1	*	'Mine is bigger': Trump dares Kim Jong-un to compare nuclear buttons. Downvoted because RT. RT is Russias state-financed international cable network.

That is an interesting question.

That is a bit harsh.. Islam punishes women for adultery with Stoning to death. Also there are many restrictions on travelling of women. Criticizing such opressive ideology is not harsh.. I didn't say that. OP was being more specific.
t1_dsiuyu5	1	*	Trump just said the US sold Norway F-52s  but no such aircraft exists. He meant 52 F-35 Lightning 2.  This is not newsworthy.. why in the fuck would we sell brand new aircraft technology to other nations? wouldn't it make more sense to sit on that technology and flaunt the fact that our dick is bigger?. Norway delivers many parts of the plane, including missile systems and other arnaments.  And you are mainly selling weapons to people you want to be well armed.. Thank you for a decent explanation. I was off base

t1_dsi9jwx	1	*	Trump just said the US sold Norway F-52s  but no such aircraft exists. We bought 52 planes.  They were F-35s. We have had 10 delivered so far.  Your President seems slightly demented.

Is this all for show or is this legitimately progress for peace?. Long term it's impossible (without regime change).  The North craves reunification with the South.  The South refuse if the North also want to retain their head of state.  It's an impasse. . Short term won't work either because of the implication.. When you say implication...

We are sorry that you got caught breaking the law, here is some money is that how you envision the letter that comes with the check will be worded?. That would be wonderful. The whole war on drugs has been a political scam to suppress and control problem populations. Same should have been done with the victims of slavery. . If stopping it would trigger huge amount of compensations then there would be less political will to do it.

Military has training and discipline. Would you agree to that requirement for every private citizen who wants to own a gun? . Yes, it makes sense to be trained to properly use a weapon that can take a life.

Hitler during the beer hall putsch attempted a coop against the Wiemar government. Now a days that would be considered terrorism, and Hiter was clearly a nationalist.

The three-time former prime minister is banned from running for office after being convicted of tax fraud  ipso facto then, he should not be able to occupy any office in the PM.. If the people are shouting out for Silvio there is no judge that can stop him. It's his time.  Putin, Trump, Erdogan, Duterte, and Berlusconi.  It's the time of despots and the scum who support them.. Don't forget Orban
t1_dts5fj6	0	*	Berlusconi pledges to deport 600,000 illegal immigrants from Italy. Someone listens to Berlusconi those days?. He is pretty strong in polls for the next election so.... He cannot be elected because of his sentences but he is still the voice of the PDL.. So it's kinda like if the GOP existed in a more culturally homogenous country.

Trump is a great deal maker who said that the President was responsible for these shut-downs.  So how is it's Schumer's?. In 1977, the government was shut down with Carter and both houses of Congress being controlled by Democrats. It happens when they don't get 60 votes that are needed in the Senate. . It wasn't because that's before they got the legal opinion that they needed to shut down during funding gaps, this is the first time

Responsible? first stop selling weapons to your own people from murdering each other. . I don't see how thats an argument for or against the use of caution in experimenting with people with newly discovered tech.  Or is this just another creative case of 'whataboutism'?.

t1_ds5ybtr	1	*	Emmanuel Macron: French president announces 'fake news' law - We will develop our legal system to protect democracy from this fake news.. This is no different than priests from the medieval era who interpreted the Bible because people were illiterate.. The difference is the internet and (somewhat) more intelligent population can easily call foul.. Yes, but the same people who believe fake news or dont believe it because their government tells them not to arent curious and looking for answers.. Sadly the case, but they will do that even without the government making any effort.
t1_ds7223j	1	*	Emmanuel Macron: French president announces 'fake news' law - We will develop our legal system to protect democracy from this fake news.. Stop regulating, idiot. All you pretend is to have full control of news. Let people discern for themselves, were not little kids nor do we need your guidance. . > were not little kids nor do we need your guidance.

It's sad that in this day and time I can't tell if your post is satire or posting in that you think is in earnest :\  Goddamn that fact sucks balls.. As a cashier, I can't help but be reminded that letting us decide things is very bad.    Not unfortunately, if we allowed for a meritocracy, we'd also be screwed, so it's a lose lose
t1_ds6ajho	1	*	Emmanuel Macron: French president announces 'fake news' law - We will develop our legal system to protect democracy from this fake news.. No no no no.  The government has no business legislating what is and isn't fake news.. They want social media platforms to tell everyone which country the story is originating from.   How is that bad?. You're thinking short-term, I'm thinking long-term.  You have to draw a line in the sand on government overreach, or they'll take it all.. The slippery slope is a fallacy.

Will they be shitty quality water like at a lot of public water fountains on the US?. You're spoiled for turning your nose up at non refrigerated non filtered tap water.  You can't put high end model public water fountains outdoors for various reasons (tragedy of the commons).. I wouldn't expect refrigeration, but depending on the area filtering may be necessary.. There aren't any areas of the UK where mains water isn't potable.

Water UK says its scheme could cut disposable plastic bottle use by tens of millions a year. The move comes amid growing concern about the effect of plastic waste on the environment.. Still no free urinals though...  Amazing how, in Britain, there is no regulation requiring eateries to supply urinals. And councils don't supply urinals either.. To be fair there's a pub around almost every corner I just use one their toilets if i'm desperate.. The pub managers don't mind?  In America they would mind.. Some do, I worked at a pub and the manager said the amount of times people have told him, they didn't know how nice the pub was until they went in desperate to pee was astounding. 
t1_dueh266	1	*	Oxfam was told of aid workers raping and sexually exploiting children in Haiti a decade ago. I cant believe a charity member would even think of doing this...People are really unpredictable.... This is a relatively new trend that has its roots in the Blair Era in the UK.  . Realistically his trend runs a lot further back. As western society has seen the Aid sector become more secular hopefully it has become less abusive.   . That is not actually the case in relation to Oxfam sadly.

Isn't the point of it to put more daylight hours in the evening where you are more likely to use them?  Why is this a bad thing?. DST isn't the problem, it's the time switch.

t1_duacg8g	1	*	London homeless man found dead 'on doorstep' of Parliament. >A man has been found dead in a Tube station underpass that leads to the Houses of Parliament.  Damn that title is missleading. . No it isn't.   1:  where he was found is less than 50 metres from parliament  2: the words are in parenthesis to show you it's not literal, but highlights how close it really is.. Regarding 2, that's also how BBC writes all direct quotations in titles, so it's unfortunately not unambiguous. I do agree that it's appropriate, though. It is a direct quotation though, by a labour MP.

Technically, I would have to say that -88.5xb0F is MUCH colder than fuck.    Colder by a LONG shot!. Growing up in SoCal, I will apply fuck to cold for anything under 32F.. AV is still So Cal, so is the snow capped mountains around you. Just sayin'
t1_dsupt6a	1	*	2 Walkers Froze to Death as Temperatures Plunged to -88.6xb0F in Parts of Russia. The real news here is that there are people who still use Fahrenheit. . A buddy told me something the other day I liked. In Fahrenheit, 0 is way cold and 100 is pretty hot. So just think of it as a heat percentage, 100 is 100% heat and 0 is 0% heat. Pretty interesting. . Where does -89 fit in this ludicrous scheme?. Its more based on how comfortable you are, like 0 is pretty damn uncomfortable. -89 is straight wildlings status.

t1_dstbx8z	1	*	2 Walkers Froze to Death as Temperatures Plunged to -88.6xb0F in Parts of Russia. The real news here is that there are people who still use Fahrenheit. . Nope... not news... just everyone in the USA... also -40 degrees is the same in both temperatures.... What does that have to do with -88.6?. absolutely nothing... much like people talking about 104 degrees with heat index in Brazil causing death amounts for nothing.

He said other countries had taken advantage of the US for years because of its very stupid trade deals. They make it impossible for our cars (and more) to sell there. Big trade imbalance!. europeans don't buy american made cars because a dually ford f350 super duty wouldn't fit in the streets. They're also expensive as fuck. They're like $80k for a 10 year old second hand vehicle here in Australia. . WTF? I've seen a lot of them (within a few years old) going in the 30s to low 40s.. Where? I'm looking at 2012 models for $100k plus.

Yes, the north Pole is the Sweden of journalism.

It might get to them one day, maybe not immediately-only vacationing in China or Russia, Cuba is supposed to be really scenic tho! .

You forget that states sponsor propaganda. 
t1_dueesgq	1	*	The Russians Indicted Friday Can't Ever Travel To A Country Friendly With The US. Weren't they traveling freely on faked passport/visas in the first place?. No? They stole US persons identities and used them to set up PayPal and bank accounts in the US. That's the identity theft part of the indictment, those who visited the country came on tourist visas.. What's with the asshole question mark? If I knew the answer, my post would have looked something like this:  They were traveling on freely faked passports/visas in the first place. .

I dont like the lottery, this shits unhealthy, even winners often find themselves broke and unhappy . Read the article. . Yeah i know he didnt win, but its not hard to find stories of people who do win and are still broke and unhappy within a couple years. That's not the fault of the lottery, that's the fault of basic economics being minunderstood. Most people that never have lots of money don't know how to have it.

I wouldn't blame Reuters for that. If the ambassador used that phrasing, and expressed the need to dismantle NKs nuclear program, Reuters will report exactly what he said.. I wasn't blaming reuters but rather just noting that folks who use phrasing like that tend to do so to push an agenda and might be willing to mislead folks in order to do that.. I wouldn't be surprised.

That's not nearly as limiting.. There is no limit on mining. If we wanted, literally every computer on the planet could be used to mine btc. Hash rate has zero impact on transaction throughput..

I think you are giving North Korea a bit too much credit for their capabilities.. It's not that NK itself has power, it's that NK has the power to set off an irreversible chain reaction by doing something stupid. That chain will end up pretty fast with NK becoming a smoldering ruin, with no significant damage to other countries.  Nuclear fallout might be a problem, though.

Even the comments and replies are like copy/pastes.  
t1_dsjqaii	0	*	Putin says shrewd Kim Jong Un has outwitted Trump in nuclear standoff between North Korea, U.S.. Trump is a loser.. Trump is a winner.  Thats why he is president.. No, he was elected because a bunch of working class people were manipulated into thinking that Trump would fight to make their lives better rather than fighting to make the rich richer. I thought he won because the dems were too busy fighting each other.

Also, we need to stop dumping ALL plastics in the sea, or else erosion basically turns them into microbeads anyway. . At this rate we'll probably just have to genetically engineer a fish that eats plastic.. That's solved, fish eat it already.. Yay we did it.

TRUMP:  Bannon was a very small part of the election and was more of a coffee boy than anything else.... Sooner or later we'll have to realize, that Trump  was just a coffee boy, as well, ....

Would SK even exist if the US didnt push the North back during the Korean War? Serious question.. Millions of Chinese and tens of thousands of Soviets turned North Koreas dirt farmer army into a combine of death sweeping over the peninsula.

t1_dtxc9n3	0	*	Macedonia says ready to change its name and end row with Greece. North Macedonia, New Macedonia... They should take their cue from the Brits and just call it Great Macedonia.  . To be fair, there actually is a Lesser Britain. Just no one every thinks about the funny thing attached to France.. That's the point... There is a Greek province called Macedonia, hence the country (F.Y.R.O.M.) can be Great Macedonia.. You do understand that would open up a whole new can of worms, right? 
t1_dtwj8yo	1	*	Macedonia says ready to change its name and end row with Greece. This is one of the pettiest diplomatic disputes in history. . For real. There are places in the US named Athens, Corfu, etc. The only reason this is an issue is because Macedonia is a small country and allows Greece to feel like it has some power/influence.. Is Athens claiming that Socrates was american and that they were the cradle of the Greek civilization?  Apples and oranges, my friend. It's really not about the name itself. . No but we have a vibrant Greek life scene ;)
t1_dtwibzs	1	*	Macedonia says ready to change its name and end row with Greece. I always thought Macedonia WAS pretty much the old Macedonia. Obviously whoever named all of this is a fanboy of Alexander the Great. . The Macedonia in Greece, *is* the old Macedonia. The country that has been *trying to call itself* Macedonia is not.. I dont think those borders are as clear as you would like them to be.. it's not just about borders, but also cultural lineage 
t1_dtw6fdd	0	*	Macedonia says ready to change its name and end row with Greece. Greece should end the row by not telling countries what they can and cannot call themselves.. Yeah sure let them claim stuff that don't belong to them. We should let them rename their capital ''Athens'' while at it.. Even USA has cities named Moscow...and there are like multiple Kievs all over the world. So what? Honestly, this dispute is so dump.. There's a Vienna, and an Alexandria within driving distance of where I live. I hope Egyptians and Austrians aren't too offended...

I'm sure they could have added an extra 8 km/day to make it 500 km.. yeah but you would have to not deviate from your initial direction, which makes it non trivial.

t1_dv0twq4	1	*	Arctic temperatures surge in the dead of winter - temperatures from February in eastern Greenland and the central Arctic are averaging about 15xb0C (27xb0F) warmer than seasonal norms.

Because authoritarian regimes have discovered that it is very easy to convince people to support them as long as they disguise their methods as anti-trump.. They don't have to convince anyone, Trumps tweets are public. Maybe consider not electing a loudmouth idiot next time.. China skates by on a policy of secrecy

Presidents cannot be convicted of crimes while in office.  Impeachment IS the process of dealing with a President who engages in criminal activity.. Um... no have you read history?

Ya its insane how those Zionists want Israel to exist as the one safe place in the world where Jews can go and not be persecuted. How evil of these Jews to want to have their own country.. Where are jews persecuted ? Jews live all over the world in every country. Where are they persecuted?

You buy the same about Syria, Libya, literally Kuwait, Vietnam, Iraq, China, Russia, name any none NATO affiliated countries, why stop here?. Good point buddy, two wrongs *DO* make a right!. His point was that many of the people who don't believe things about Israel without reputable sources WOULD if it was about non-US allies, not that it makes it right.

Pretty arrogant of you to claim this is an artificial problem. There's enough evidence to make a case, so lets see how it plays out. Discrimination should be stamped out no matter what. . Over 60% of googles employees are white men and this guy is a racist and sexist piece of garbage. He's the problem, and so are you for pushing a bullshit narrative.. How's a percentage of how many whites there are in the company describe the racism situation there?   People that I worked for hire people based on merit, not skin colour or gender.

Depends how many cars would be taken off the road with improved rail service.  It may actually reduce emissions more than a forest of 50 million trees would offset.    . Why not both! 
t1_dsmbj8m	1	*	U.K. Government Plans 'Northern Forest' of 50 Million New Trees spanning across England from Liverpool on West coast to the East coast city of Hull. Theyre only providing 5% of the funding, so its a pipe dream. Maybe but it depends on the implementation, for example private forests where the users are asked to pay for entry. People still get the benefits of trees but visitors fund it.. Not really a thing in the UK. Plenty of free forests and nature reserves. Don't think I've ever come across a 'private/paid for' forest. Yeah, I really can't see people paying to look at trees.  They're not quite that rare yet.

The use of critical antibiotics is being phased out however in the next 2 years.. So, what's the reason that we aren't up in arms about their use in US and EU?. I suppose cuz in India the government hasn't realised it yet or aren't taking steps.   The use is being phased out in EU and US markets. No such steps have been taken by the Indian government.

t1_ds2wc6o	1	*	Look for an 'almost inevitable cold war' between the US and China, strategist says. If Trump makes it 4 years we will be in a Cold War with the everyone. . We do not need war, All we want is friendship and peace! American is great, Chinese too. Both China and the United States benefit greatly from a positive relationship. Seems foolish for either country to ruin the current balance. Greed and power usually manages to mess things up.. Totally agree with you.
t1_duurpxh	1	*	Eating vegetables, fruit and whole grains may combat depression, study suggests. Could it be that people with the means to access these foods (cheaper foods are typically lower quality--junkfood, basically) also benefit from all the ancillary benefits of... well, wealth?. Eating healthy isn't expensive, that's mostly a myth. Where do you live?. Connecticut (USA). Everything is expensive here, but I noticed that I've spent 20-30% less on food on average as a vegetarian (about 6 months into it). 
t1_dtb7u32	1	*	Julian Assange pleads to leave Ecuadorian embassy because of 'depression and bad tooth'. Whats the deal with all the hate on assange? . He acted as part of the Russian program to manipulate the American Presidential election.   That's basically anti democratic, and his claims of moral high ground seem extremely hollow now.. He informed the American public about corruption within our government. Sorry that it exposed your preferred candidate/party for what she/it truly is, but truth should be valued over political bias. . Its not about that. I would feel the very same way no matter who he hurt. My country as a free democracy comes before my candidate. 
t1_dss6sxu	1	*	Theresa May has been hit with a double Brexit blow as the EU toughened up its terms for a transition period and Norway privately warned the EU that giving in to the UKs demands for a special trade deal could force it to rip up its own agreements. Ah the country that voted No booth time and still became a member of Eu against its people's will. . That's the main reason I'm against the EU. If they weren't so undemocratic and actually listened to the people of the member states, I'd be all for the United States of Europe. . Your main reason is factually false, I bet you support EU now?. Nah I don't support us being in the EU as it currently is. 
t1_dsrqbnk	1	*	Theresa May has been hit with a double Brexit blow as the EU toughened up its terms for a transition period and Norway privately warned the EU that giving in to the UKs demands for a special trade deal could force it to rip up its own agreements. So Norway dont like there current arrangement? . They like it but it would obviously be unfair to give the UK a special deal. If the UK gets one, why shouldn't Norway? That's the point.. They could always, you know, join the EU. But speaking as someone who knows nothing about the economy, they probably have good reasons not to.. Norway are the most financially secure country in Europe. They saved all their oil profits and put it into a national fund.

t1_dtgldt1	1	*	White House to Congress: Russia sanctions not needed now. Republicans are a disgrace . Republicans voted 99% in favour of it. It's not a party issue, it's a Trump issue.. If Republicans don't impeach Trump for violating the constitution here then it is a Republican issue.. He is not violating the constitution, in this case. The only power Trump has is the hope that Congress won't stop him, which is likely, since congress likes sucking his dick

t1_dth3tij	0	*	White House to Congress: Russia sanctions not needed now. Pitch forks and torches yet? How far are we gonna let this go?. Not until the thing with Mueller finishes.. Why? At this point to not punish him is letting him explicitly ignore implementation of law. It's beyond 'I'm above the law', this is 'i am the law'. Something needs to be done. . No offense but I can't really trust people like you, too many agent provocateurs on reddit.  even if turning it violent would be a huge mistake. 
t1_dtgqmdz	1	*	White House to Congress: Russia sanctions not needed now. If he chooses to not follow a law passed with a veto proof majority and congress does nothing, he is pretty much a dictator who has no one to check his power.. Also a criminal. Not following a law is called crime. . A criminal is someone convicted of said crime. Not sure that's likely here.. that's a convict, criminals just have to commit a crime

Staying at a job after a 10% pay reduction is insane. If you have an education or some skills that can land you a new job definitely try to make the jump ASAP.. I've seen almost a 20% reduction. I'm an industrial mine electrician in Canada and that industry as well as oil and gas is struggling, so cuts across the board . At least that one's not insulting, but presumably if the industry is in the shitter you couldn't find anything better anyway.

Because liberals think it will somehow change Trump supporters minds while conservatives see it as a step against protecting their jobs. . If you're so replaceable that an unskilled worker from another country can come and replace you, that's just the free market at work.  I thought conservatives liked the free market.

It's likely they have done many.  Most of his shots aren't even necessarily related to the movie itself.  I mean look at the one where he was talking to the big head guys from green lantern recently. . Actually, they were the Watchers, the Oans are the ones from Green Lantern.      Incidentally, if this was a troll, jolly good sir!. I think you are right actually, and i've likely just mistakenly thought of them as the same thing.

This is terrible, is there anything I can do to help? Any organisations in Vietnam trying to overturn this?. Unfortunately no, as anyone who could help had all fled. For obvious reasons.. Maybe they should all leave, leave no one to support the communist party there, see where the communist go with no one to be their slaves.. Like china, the communist government don't allow you to bring your wealth to outside.   That's why bitcoin  is popular there.

Fucking commies.. If Vietnam were really communist they wouldn't allow American corporations to set up shop on their land and exploit their workers.. It's not American. Read the damn article before you come here and make yourself look silly.. Just because this one isn't an American corporation doesn't mean that there aren't American corporations there.

As an American seeing that this is a US company confirms that we aren't so great. . Company is Vietnamese. The person that wrote/translated the headline is just a moron. The US in the title is referencing the valuation of the steel company in USD.. valuation of the facility I think, not the company.. That just makes the headline seem even worse lol...

OK, then.  People had the right to mutilate little baby boys in Iceland. Soon, they won't have that right any more. What's the problem?  .

t1_dufessl	1	*	Iceland law to outlaw male circumcision sparks row over religious freedom. Circumcision was rightfully banned. We would never let it happen to girls. Control over your own body is a fundemental right. This needs to happen in the US.. I dont like male circumcision but equating it to female circumcision is disingenuous as fuck.  . Yes it can be like comparing cutting a finger off to cutting an arm off.    The point is though that both are rather disgusting practises and should be viewed as such. . Apparently, not as disgusting as forcing people to choose between religion and law. Way to go!
t1_dugh00z	1	*	Iceland law to outlaw male circumcision sparks row over religious freedom. That picture.... Jesus that kids like 7 who the fuck circumcises a kid that old?.

That's how we got Sarah Palin. and she was just dipshit training wheels for our current predicament. .

QPU president Ian Leavers said sneaky devices did not reduce states road toll or stop people from speeding.. I know this isn't gonna be a popular opinion. But maybe people should stick to the speed limits.. If everyone stuck to the speed limit in California, we'd be stuck in traffic for half the day.   Instead we should enforce passing lane rules.

We still have not received any info on how many illegals were living in the tower block, nor a comprehensive list of victims. . *So?* What has the status of a human being to do with burning painfully to death?. Maybe he doesn't want an illegal underclass in his country.. Sure, if that's his opinion it's okay to say so, but I see a huge difference between being against illegal immigration and valuing the life of victims a lot lower because of their background.

The US wanted more environmental protections? That's interesting.

t1_dt5ouw9	0	*	Trudeau announces trade agreement without U.S.. I like how the headline fails to mention it is the HATED TPP. The golden rule of reddit political theory: if Trump does something, side with the opposition.. how could you state a rule about that when there has been almost no instance where what trump is doing hasn't been objective garbage?.

Obama was just really good at making us look good. We never were. . This was designed to do to white collar middle class jobs what NAFTA did to blue collar middle class jobs in the US.  If you are not a 1%-er in the US, this was a bad deal for you.. You fail to mention that in the USA, if you arent part of the top 1% everything is a bad deal.. Ummm, no.  The bottom 20% have it fucking rough. Everyone else is probably kind of ok to varying degrees.

China doesn't even call it South China Sea, it's called South Sea, because there was no country challenging China's sovereignty in the region before 20th century.. China doesn't have sovereignty over international waters. And 12 nautical miles within a country's island is not international waters, it's territorial waters.

At the height of the housing crisis? You have to be pretty naive to believe this was a regular real estate deal.. 2008 is when prices *peaked*. Ffs you kids have zero memory.

Best believe if they took my farm land away I'd burn it all and leave that shithole country.. You won't need to burn it, they'll probably mismanage it to the point that it's useless anyway.. Funny, some friends of mine had a nut farm outside Grahamstown. They moved to Aus, it took the new ownership less than 2 years to abandon the property. Its just a dead piece of land now.. Fuck that is infuriating.  There are too many examples like these. How the SA gov can still think this will end well is incomprehensible.

Thats like saying showing holocaust pictures is spreading nazi propaganda..

Well, Le Pen is neither a journalist nor is she being held to the American version of free speech Donalds, as it appears you think is the case.. Or any free speech apparently.

If it makes you feel any better his parents probably drowned trying to save him, so they couldn't give their consent.

If you are a known abusive that has a criminal record for either rape, murder, abuse or any other violent crimes, then yes.  If, however, you have a clean record then I imagine not, no..

Post-Christian values are what will save Europe, not doubling down on a religion that isnt as far away from Islam as it likes to think it is.. Christians are terrified that Islam is replacing Christianity; they should be terrified of atheism/agnosticism. Teenagers now are less interested in religion than ever.. Atheists and agnostics don't have kids much whereas Muslims (and religious folk in general) worldwide are very productive in this aspect.  . Just because their parents are religious doesn't mean the children will be religious. In Europe you'll see tons of young muslims drink, not pray, not fast, have premarital sex etc.

And the the purpose less women's march last year had  5 articles on the front page every hour. Its outrageous tbh. There are many other posts of the same story, and they split the votes.. how does that work? reddit isn't a first-past-the-post election. do people say, I can't upvote this article, because I just upvoted a different one of the same topic. ?.

I was just thinking this is going to be a golden opportunity for intel gathering.

Israel does not want its soldiers to die. They have had enough of that with every generation. They're tired of this shit. They're more so  being proactive against real threats. . The real threat of Syria's air defenses.

Fuck, it must be nice to live in a country where people matter more than corporations.. The people pay for this of course.

Ah, that classic American conservative/puritan/capitalist sentiment:  *I accumulated my wealth horde by working hard; fuck the less fortunate because they're probably lazy*. If you want to do well in America:   1. Graduate High School   2. Get a job   3. Don't have kids until you get married    2% of people who follows these rules live in poverty.

But if a person is a terrorist, meaning they've committed an act, wouldn't they likely be dead or in prison (making taking their kids away rather superfluous)?. Well, there's still their spouse, who likely shared the ideology, but won't necessary go to prison as well. They'd retain custody. . So this would be a way to punish the spouse and children for something their partner did by tearing the family apart without trial or even a need to prove any wrongdoing?. Yes. This is basically what that is.

They screw you over bigtime, fuck this company.. You lose A LOT of pension in Belgium when you're self-employed..

It was 1984. That would be like blaming someone for something their father did.. There are an extra 10,000,000 people in the UK comparing 1984 to 2017.

What happened to the days when trolling was just making little kids angry on call of duty or any other game with an online multiplayer. It changed when a bunch of morons started calling everything they didn't like trolling .. Bullshitting or harassing online has always been more or less what it meant and it never had a hard definition anyways. Just a description. Lets call it *Trollin' Xtreem*.. Trolling was an artform. Feigning stupidity, being offensive without the venom and pseduo-clever or ironic pranks used to be the basis of trolling before people started bastardizing it.

t1_dv0k9do	1	*	Acid to be defined as 'highly dangerous weapon' for first time to impose tougher prison sentences. The UK clearly just needs more good guys with acid.  . We can't ban acid! How will we defend ourselves against tyranny! Stop violating my right to bear acid! I knew all along that one day the evil government would come for my acid!. I wonder if when encountering an acid attacker, if the UK police stop the person by pointing a gun at them or hoping they give up by using thoughts and prayers?. Or maybe they use some sort of option in between killing them and praying? As an American I'm sure that's hard to imagine.

If the protest is successful, what will be accomplished? Serious question. . The fact his visit has been postponed/hesistated so far is proof that protests are having some kind of effect. Trump wants to avoid them, clearly.. Trumps ego is incredibly fragile; a massive protest clearly aimed at him visiting will upset him.   As an American, I especially encourage this activity . So you want to make him even more hostile and volatile than he already is? Fantastic

t1_dtngm0h	1	*	Brexit to go ahead even if Governments own analysis shows it will make Britain poorer, Theresa May suggests. Well fuck, what's the point in conducting analysis then, if you are not going to base your actions on it.  As usual with May, it's a case of ignore any facts or evidence that don't fit her world.. We call them Republicans here in the USA.... Democrats don't care what their constituents want? Interesting.   . If by constituents you mean whoever if buying them out, then yeah they arent at all like republicans.
t1_dtn350k	1	*	Brexit to go ahead even if Governments own analysis shows it will make Britain poorer, Theresa May suggests. Makes sense considering the people voted to leave and that's how democracy works.. It was a non-binding referendum. The British government was not obliged by any means to act on it. . Even so, if the British government doesn't act on something that is non-binding, that does sort of undermind the entire democratic process.. Google Belgian kings question

Check out this mice that froze to death  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twwFDURBWs0  . I have a hard time believing that wasn't posed.  Freezing to death isn't so instantaneous.. Why do you think it's instantaneous?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhfx6RV4tXw  I advise you to mute the video before watching.  Check out 1:02, I'm not surprised the tiger's tail got frozen..

Maybe try BrexIn instead?. How exactly would that help given that this is the situation arrived at while being within the EU?. You think Brexit is the right way to go? I think all of Europe should come closer and work together rather than splitting up and cooking their own little soups. Together we are strong. . No, I think they're saying that this issue was due to austerity and not brexit as this occurred before the brexit vote and the UK still hasn't actually left the EU.

Why is it so hard for Africans to get it together?. I think it has something to do with colonialism but that's just a guess. Liberia was never colonized. It was part of America until it petitioned for its independence. . It was colonised, by former American slaves.

No way anyone's going to risk a coconut to the head!
t1_du5sn2u	0	*	China is re-assigning 60,000 troops - to plant trees. In Canada many young people are now doing tree planting as a full time job as opposed to just a summer job to pay for school.. Interesting. I did not know that, and I am half Canadian.. Actually for decades it has been  part of the logging companies legal responsibility to replant all crown land they cut.  I know people who were doing it back in the mid 1970's.. The logging companies are replanting with monoculture (spruce) and spraying the *crop* with herbicides and it isn't sustainable forestry. At least that's how it's going in my province.

It is in my opinion. Obviously many in India believe otherwise.. Well those people are wrong.

He's not making 1k per week, depending on how much gas hes burning he's not making much at all.. and he has to take taxes out himself, so its more like 800ish. Yeah, lets keep incorrecting each other
t1_dv3zzn0	0	*	Uber and Lyft drivers' median hourly wage is just $3.37, report finds. It won't matter much longer.  Uber and Lyft will be using self-driving cars soon. . It's unlikely that self-driving cars would be literally driverless for a while.. They just approved pure driverless testing in California - 2 years max before Uber starts running driverless cars.. but will they? then they have to have insurance, pay for gas and deal with people. if you let others then all that is on the person who owns the car. 
t1_dsgm712	1	*	Jeff Bezos is the richest person in history. This is a ridiculous statement. Bezos's worth doesn't compare historically to that of Augustus, Genghis Khan, Mansa Musa, or even John D Rockefeller. . How can you forget about other unlisted people ? Like the rothschilds, or certain kings or queens ?   What about Andrew Carnegie ? His wealth in today's dollars would be astounding ! . I just thought of a few names I could remember. It's a long list of individuals if you do some research, including Popes. The Rothschilds are not a single individual, though. . They might as well be. Look on that list: many are listed as a group. The waltons etc.

That's scary as fuck! . It has actually saved us a few times when military leaders strongly advised striking Russia. Civilian leaders should generally be less trigger happy. Unfortunately we elected Trump.. Then there was Nancy Reagan, first female actual-president of the US who kept taking the nuke keys from her idiot husband.. First female actual president  Wat

Yea, constitutions are written to last forever and not to be modernized. This is not your local grandma's club updating its membership rules. Smh.. . But it was written with amendments.  To amend means to change. It was written with an included process of how to change it.. But to propose to change or amend it is unconstitutional?
t1_durk51d	0	*	Australian PM declines to offer Trump any advice on gun control. The US constitution is 200 yrs out of date. Maybe time to modernise. . Totally.

t1_due6a7m	1	*	Five Chinese military innovations that threaten U.S. dominance. No one knows if any of their shit actually works.. It's kinda ironic that people question the legitimacy of the Chinese threat while at the same time claiming that the Chinese is a big enough threat to increase defense spending. Which one is it?. Oh I see why it's confusing. I'm what's known as a person, not people.. You're not the only person with the idea. 
t1_dua431r	1	*	Israeli Knesset Rejects Bill Recognizing the Armenian Genocide. People who survived a genocide refuse to recognise a genocide probably because what they are doing now is also a genocide.. Israel is guilty of ethnic cleansing, not genocide.. Ethnic cleansing falls under the definition of genocide.. That's like saying all insects fall under the definition of bugs. It's factually wrong.

They don't want people hoping into the space before they offer their own: A) P2P Wallet B) Exchange C) Coin/Token  Crypto is coming to FB, peeps - Be ready for it :). Wouldn't a blockchain currency backed or managed by a corporation not defeat the entire purpose of decentralization and mutual transparency?. Cough ripple cough. I have thought about a fourth option... Facebook acquiring an existing token.  Ripple wouldnt be their top pick imo.  Dash is though. 
t1_dsdpjdv	0	*	Oprah Winfrey may be considering running for President of US in 2020. Electing someone because you saw them on TV is what got the US into this mess, it'd be a mistake to do it again. Are you referring to Reagan?. Trump. You're honestly going to blame the last 60+ years on Trump?  He's been POTUS for <1 year.   He's a president, not a king you knuckle heads. 
t1_dsuttx4	1	*	CNN 'wins' taking 4 out of 11 'accolades' announced by Donald Trump. Glad to know that our president and Commander in Chief has his priorities straight two days before a looming government shutdown. . Genuinely curious: Is the government actually going to shut down?. Yes . Maybe...But probably not as moderate democrats aren't pushing for it. If they draw a line then its highly likely.
t1_dubho0i	1	*	Russia says it has proof of Western influence in its upcoming election. Russia and elections. Those two words doesn't fit together.. Not saying theres not fuckery going on but there are elections and Putin does actually have pretty widespread support . Which makes you wonder why he feels the need to arrest and kill his opponents.. Reminds me of Nixon's paranoia. Except he'll get away with it. 
t1_du131j6	1	*	Pakistan court convicts 31 over campus lynching of student falsly accused of blasphemy. Very telling that it has to be said that he was falsely accused of blasphemy. As though the lynching wouldve been perfectly appropriate had he actually insulted someones imaginary friend. . >Blasphemy is a highly sensitive issue in Pakistan, where insulting Islams prophet is punishable by death.. I'm an equal opportunity hater, but for the sake of insulting this one religion this one time: *fuck muhammed*   Hey pakistan, come at me, bro..

Said he's doing an unbelievable job on the drug problem.  https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/23/us/politics/trump-duterte-phone-transcript-philippine-drug-crackdown.html. Tbf, Trump is just saying what basically every president, since the War on Drugs started, has implied. It was *always* about killing and caging brown people and nothing else.  The American drug war is quite literally a textbook example of racism.. Poor...  Poor people. 
t1_dunqeu5	0	*	Senator: Rodrigo Duterte's drug war has killed 20,000. I would be OK with 20K dead meth dealers in Murica. They will never bring anything but destruction and death to the population.

Still dumb to imprison him for those lyrics, even if they are technically threatening. .  In Germany, you can get imprisioned for saying Heil Hitler, in Spain you can get imprisioned for supporting terrorist groups and threatening people. Not dumb if you ask me.
t1_dti8v11	1	*	Trump is ignoring a near-unanimous (98-99%) Congressional agreement on imposing sanctions against Russia for interfering in the US election. He won't even acknowledge that Russian interference happened. Instead, he is ignoring Congress to serve the interests of Putin. This is not how America works.. Ignoring doesn't mean serving interest though.. It does happen to conviently coencide with russian interests though.. Ah so it's confirmed then. Just because it fits what you want to believe. Got it.   Thank god I don't live in the states. . Is there stronger evidence suggesting that god is responsible for which country you live in?

t1_duzcb3p	0	*	Russian escort Nastya Rybka offers to reveal Trump-Russia links in exchange for jail release.. She's a nobody who knows a lot about somebodies, has demonstrated her willingness to talk, and is currently in a cage. She probably doesn't have long on this planet.. I can't say I have much confidence that the current administration will take her up on her offer. If I was the CIA I'd get her out of there just for the intel.. What US entity would negotiate her release? State Dept? Under whose direction? Even if there is a diplomatic option to get her into US custody, couldn't Trump just block it?. Normally I'd say state department, but in the past we've had ex-presidents and famous people successfully negotiate the release of prisoners.
t1_dv0jnrm	1	*	Russian escort Nastya Rybka offers to reveal Trump-Russia links in exchange for jail release.. Sounds legit.... It must be, she is quite attractive.. she looks 50% neanderthal. hmmm, fuck yeah
t1_duzc66g	1	*	Russian escort Nastya Rybka offers to reveal Trump-Russia links in exchange for jail release.. Sounds legit.... In this case it may be.

She's a nobody who knows a lot about somebodies, has demonstrated her willingness to talk, and is currently in a cage. She probably doesn't have long on this planet.. Hopefully the current Piss-Monger-In-Chief doesnt have long in office after this either. Everything leads back to sex and with a miscreant like Drumpf, that will be a long and messy trail. . I love the current breed of outraged puritanism by the left. Weren't y'all sporting pussy hats not too long ago?. Pussy hats for reproductive rights vs an adulterer getting multiple passes from religious leaders... one of these things is outrageous.

Does anyone have a link to an English language documentary about these Gates? I love giant engineering projects and have never watched anything about these, it'd be really cool to learn more.. Check the maeslandtkering wiki page. It names a couple of dicovery channel shows on which it was featured:). I started there, but finding discovery shows online for streaming is pretty difficult, they police their content really hard. Someone else gave me a great link though, thanks for the suggestion.. Cool, enjoy!
t1_ds6669m	1	*	For the first time in a decade, the Dutch 'Maeslantkering' storm surge barrier, one of the largest movable structures in the world, will close due to high seas.. Actually, all five major storm surge barriers have closed for the first time in history. A historic day :) . A graph of the closure frequency over time would be telling.. Yeah that would be really useful, then you can tell exactly when it goes from never closed to 1.. All 2 times in its history!
t1_ds5gfmo	0	*	For the first time in a decade, the Dutch 'Maeslantkering' storm surge barrier, one of the largest movable structures in the world, will close due to high seas.. Are the high seas due to climate change or is this just a one-off incident?. The high water level is because of a storm. Storms happen with or without climate change. Maybe they will happen more often than before now, but the storm itself is not really special.. True, although it is remarkable that for the first time in their history, all major storm surges have been closed by the authorities. . >all major storm surges have been closed by the authorities.

Well Nato put nukes in Turkey so should he decide, he could probably do some crazy shit and take the country or even the region down the drain.. They're the US's nukes and Turkey has no control over them. Because of Permissive Action Links, Turkey cannot arm or deploy them without the DoD codes.

I mean tbh, the USA is dealing with the far crazier and more dangerous North Korea. Who gives a shit about what Erdogan threatens with.. The difference is that we like the country that borders N Korea.  I don't think anyone in the US would notice if a Turkish war spilled into Syria or Georgia. What they would notice is if Turkish forces, who are on paper NATO allies of the US, happened to attack US personnel operating in Syria in aid of Turkey's declared enemies of the state (the Kurds).

That is true, but median income in the US better than median income in the UK ($10-15k higher). And it's not even close once you get to about 70th percentile in income..

You're right, The EU is lucky we decided to leave, after all, we're sinking faster than a tonne of lead right about now.  edit: typo fix. Globally?

Thanks for that, I'm probably on some list now.

Most Apple devices I've used have lasted longer than non-Apple counterparts.. What about Light-bulb manufacturers?. Light-bulb manufacturers do not come into your house after 2000 hours to actively make your 60W bulb give out the same light as a 40W one.  Apple OTOH does that with the software updates.. No. They just let your light-bulbs burn out completely so that you have no light at all.

Lets encourage Jews to wear yellow badges. We may not agree with the concept of it but we should support there right to do so! We may also totally ignore it if they get coerced into wearing them!. The pink triangle is seen as a gay pride symbol now so why not?  I don't support coercing or forcing women to wear hijabs but if that's what somebody wants to wear then by all means wear it.

Yeah that's real comforting coming from a guy who accused the us of attacking him almost every month this past year.  . Well we do run joint-military exercises which simulate an attack on North Korea every August.  That's like someone practicing a raid on your house across the street from you every year.. It simulates a defense of S Korea. As part of the repulsion of the attack by the North we push them back across the DMZ and further. It does not simulate a first strike attack by US or allied forces.. > It does not simulate a first strike attack by US or allied forces.

Obama didnt claim he would fix it in his first 100 days.

Something about freedom of the press I suspect, but there really should be standards even for a free press, misleading or outright fake news isn't really that much better than state-controlled news.. Gonna start my own nonsense spouting clickbait 'news' website, then everyone here can source it for the lols...
t1_dtulipa	0	*	German police call for the 'complete decriminalization' of cannabis, saying current policy is neither 'intelligent or productive'. It's extremely productive if you're a private prison owner. . Yeah. You cannot own a prison in Germany. I guess thats one of the differences that count in this matter. . Coming from America my brain did not even venture into the possibility that privatized prisons would be illegal in Germany. How sad is that. . Yeah i mean why wouldn't the rest of the world treat bodily autonomy like a good source of income?  Typing this sarcastic response made me realise how close to slavery that sounds...

US AG is United States Attorney General Jeff Sessions and he's a piece of shit IMO.    Neither intelligent nor productive.  . Thanks for the clarification.

Now they want to act like the good guy?. No, they want to snatch up the trade partners that trump is telling to go elsewhere. Trump is singlehandedly destroying America while 34% of the population cheers for him. It's hilarious.. Ummm, you might want to look at reality some time.  Unemployment is at an 18 year low and the stock market is breaking records.  . The stock market is artificially conflated and serves a subset of the US population, not the economy as a whole.
t1_dv6jle2	0	*	China vows to work with other nations to counter Trump tariffs. If the final measures of the United States hurt Chinese interests, China will work with other affected countries in taking measures to safeguard its own rights and interests, the statement said.. Time to call in all the US Treasury Bonds and absolutely fuck the USA? China is the largest holder of American debt aside from the USA itself. . China would fuck itself by withdrawing all US Treasury Bonds. They can only do it gradually or not put new money into US Treasury Bonds, which Trump will need if he wants to finance his tax cuts.. Still, no matter how you shake it, China holds power over the United States, and there is nothing America can do about it

t1_dt2oqye	1	*	Poll found 0% of Icelanders under 25 believe Bible creation story. People can appreciate the Bible, the Rig Veda or even ancient Greek mythology for that matter, without believing that the myths in them are literally true. One of the virtues of a modern education.. Tell that to an American . Contrary to what The Cheeto implies, many of us have also read books.. Hey! Show some respect! He's the Cheeto-IN-CHIEF!

t1_dt2lpsk	0	*	Poll found 0% of Icelanders under 25 believe Bible creation story. This is concerning. Not for scientific reasons but morality ones. . Why? I don't think morals are dependent on religious beliefs.. Ok. Where do morals come from then? (I'm not trying to be a jerk. I'm curious to what you say) . Morals come from good parenting and experiencing a world where you know that you dont have all the answers of life and existence
t1_dt32fgq	0	*	Poll found 0% of Icelanders under 25 believe Bible creation story. Not a particularly religious man myself, but boy, frontpage atheism does seem to bring out the hairy necklined demographic doesn't it lol  . No, that's just your bias showing.  . What is my bias?. You just insulted people based on religious views, don't act like you're unbiased.

This is not the funniest comment but its probably the right one.

t1_dt2pl54	1	*	Poll found 0% of Icelanders under 25 believe Bible creation story. I went to a Catholic high school. My Theology teacher said it's becoming more and more accepted that the Creation story should not be taken literally. YMMV in other parts of the world.. Funny how people cant accept that its all BS so they change it from literal to figurative and then keep believing the BS. Can you explain the BIG bang? . Redshift, blueshift.  Lots of data.  Still much we dont know.  Throwing a Middle Eastern fairy tale in as an explanation really bad idea.  
t1_dt2jns2	1	*	Poll found 0% of Icelanders under 25 believe Bible creation story. News Flash - 1 billion Catholics don't either. . IIRC it has been for a long time an official tenet of the Catholic Church that the Genesis is an allegory.. Having spent 8 years in the Catholic education system (in the 70's), I can verify that. Science classes were taught with competence - evolution, biology, age of the universe, etc, no issues. .. Then why bother with the rest of it? We don't read the first half of a biology book and say oh those were some good stories, now the rest is all super true though.

t1_dt2qht8	1	*	Poll found 0% of Icelanders under 25 believe Bible creation story. But do they believe in Oden?. Not many of us do. (unfortunatly)  About 3000 Icelanders are in the xc1satrxfaafxe9lag that is the religious entity that organizes around the Old norse relegion.. Serious follow-up question: do they really believe in the Old Norse Mythology or just they found it cool? Is a huge roleplay organization or actual religious stuff?. I'm from Iceland and I know a guy who is in the xc1satrxfaafxe9lag mainly because he didn't want the state church to get his tax money, and he though this was funnier.

t1_dsh9p64	0	*	Parliament staff made 24,000 attempts to view online pornography in four months.. Seriously if its adult who cares? I'm a woman fyi . Because it was at work..in the offices. Basically staff members trying to jerk off at work while getting paid..by tax payers.  . I missed the part about how they are trying to ban porn. It didn't say this necessarily happened at work. Maybe I missed that. . Yeah, the issue was the 24000 attempts were made on the parliament networks within the building and using government owed vpns that are strictly for business 
t1_dsd8iw6	1	*	Parliament staff made 24,000 attempts to view online pornography in four months.. Everyone faps. I don't see why it is such a big deal that elected officials get berated for watching porn, unless it's kiddie, torture, revenge, or the like.. ....at work tho.. Ah, good point. I would hope, at least, that it's behind locked doors or something and not in the middle of a legislative session.... Haha you mean like this?  https://youtu.be/e4HzDT8CtfQ
t1_dsdcyek	1	*	Parliament staff made 24,000 attempts to view online pornography in four months.. These are rookie numbers.. You gotta pump those numbers up!. They're busy pumping other things. Drain the swamp, drain the swamp!

'All for me, not for thee'  Fucking hypocrites...... Its, Rules for thee, not for me. .

Sure, as soon as all the shit he and his daughter sells is too... 
t1_dumbqzg	1	*	Mexican cartels switch gears after U.S. states relax marijuana laws. More opium production may actually lessen fentanyl deaths, as more opium would weaken the price, and thus the need to spike heroin with fentanyl. Cannabis legalize ftw!. Actually the opposite is happening. Dealers cut  heroin with fentanyl so they have more quanity to sell and more profit. Similar to cutting coke for more profit.. Cutting a cheap product with an expensive one doesnt make sense.  Fentanyl is so strong, that they can add a tiny amount to some shitty smack and sell it for more.  . It's not expensive. It's cheap, otherwise they wouldn't do it. Remember that the goal of drugs isn't grams but effect. If the effect per $ is less for one drug than another, then it's cheaper. 
t1_dt413ne	0	*	Former Australian leader thinks the invasion and massacre of aboriginals was a 'good thing for everybody. Because it was. Australia wouldn't be nearly as developed..

t1_dsgy1n1	0	*	US must act now to ward off more Russian election meddling, report says. The most effective action available is to obviate ad-driven brigade friendly social media and we are SO on it. The least effective action would be an attempt to curtail Free Speech in the USA.. They already did that second one with trump . The entire establishment is having a brown trouser moment, not just Trump's half. None of them are talking about doing anything remotely useful or effective.. Yeah Republicans have been useless for like 20 years. At least in 2020 we will have actual leaders back.

t1_dtry7ir	0	*	Immigrants are largely behind Canada's status as one of the best-educated countries. Probably all come from shithole countries. Canada can keep all those smart people for all I care.  I'm too busy winning. #America #MAGA #ReleasedTheMemo. They don't, many come from #America http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/as-sa/99-010-x/2011001/c-g/c-g02-eng.cfm. Did I not say shithole country?. I wouldn't. They are flawed, yes, but trying to improve themselves. The success of that is debatable. 
t1_dtqojoi	1	*	Immigrants are largely behind Canada's status as one of the best-educated countries. Of course, they have some of the strictest immigration standards, and only accept well educated immigrants.  Edit: Well educated immigrants is a bit of hyperbole.  strict standards nonetheless.. I cannot comment on whether we (Canada) has the strictest immigration standards as Im not well informed. But we do not exclusively accept well educated immigrants, thats just inaccurate. . Dude Canada has A TOUGH immigration program. The points system is strict, and it's well known it's harder to move to Canada then to the US.. I remember when they started asking mexican tourists for VISA and so many including myself just refused to go, they then dropped it.
t1_dtrawgg	1	*	Immigrants are largely behind Canada's status as one of the best-educated countries. Merit based immigration, this is exactly what Trump wants to do. Its racist when he wants to do it but great when Canada does it. Funny how that is.. He hasn't done shit in a year. New Supreme Court Justice, reforming the tax system, defeating isis just to name a few things . Defeating ISIS? Really? Russia and Assad defeated ISIS. I'm no fan of either of them and wish both would abdicate, but that is where the credit is due if we're being honest. 
t1_dtrx83y	1	*	Immigrants are largely behind Canada's status as one of the best-educated countries. Legal immigrants or poor people who snuck into the country?. How much does it matter if the country is better off for it?. You'll need to convince me that millions of poor, uneducated immigrants are better for a country than educated immigrants who contribute meaningfully to a country.. I think it's key to be realistic about the immigrant situation in Canada. The evidence suggests that Canada is better for their immigration, regardless of legal status. 
t1_dtuo5qk	0	*	Immigrants are largely behind Canada's status as one of the best-educated countries. If you're OK with becoming a host for another culture, immigration is great. If you want to retain your birth, or native culture, immigration is not so helpful. . Isnt Canada a mix of cultures anyway? Why would you expect the mixing to suddenly stop when its increasing everywhere else in the world?. Immigration is increasing in Bangladesh? Immigration is increasing in the Middle East? How about Russia and China?. Maybe not but their traditional culture is slowly fading away as well. So how is it really that relevant to immigration?

t1_dtah6xl	1	*	George Soros: Facebook and Google are a menace to society - Mining and oil companies exploit the physical environment; social media companies exploit the social environment, said the Hungarian-American businessman.. Hypocrisy at its finest. 1%ers amuse me. The way 99% of us are amusing to them . If you are earning more than 32,400 US dollars a year you are in the 1% by the way. . You should be using purchasing power parity for working that out.  Although you do have a point, it's more like the 0.01% than the 1%. This is after using purchasing power parity. 
t1_dtanafo	1	*	George Soros: Facebook and Google are a menace to society - Mining and oil companies exploit the physical environment; social media companies exploit the social environment, said the Hungarian-American businessman.. Completely true, but google was a solution to the problem of search engines sucking donkey, it made the internet a lot more palatable for the general public . Which was the equivalent of giving a chimp a loaded ak-47.  Makes me long for the days when the internet was the realm of us nerds alone :/ . Oh yes, back then only the finest, most logical champs of the technocratic enlightenment roamed the intertubes. That was the golden age. *Tips fedora*  Almost /r/gatekeeping material.. Yes, yes we did.  Sometimes you need a gate to keep out the riffraff.

Hey why hasn't he and his awful family been arrested?  Israel do you really want a corrupt conman running your latest war?. I don't like him but no charges were issued yet. He is innocent until proven guilty.. Innocent in the eyes of the law. That means nothing about what the people should believe.

Never discredit that possibility. Today however, it looked to be an actual infant.

This is great as the USA was really screwing everyone in the TPP on the medicines and ip.. Considering IP makes up a huge portion of what the US actually produces it would be nice if we could get other people to actually pay for it.. IP laws are horrible. Progress happens with the free exchange of ideas not locking them away. . Exactly, ask China, they just steal it.

The main indicator for how people voted on brexit wasn't age, it was education.   Yes, lots of old people voted leave, but so did lots of younger people too, who lacked critical thinking skills..

Arguments that start with 'so you...' and then shoehorn the argument in the weakest form possible can easily be ignored.. i think claiming that germany is taking in 'huge numbers of bigots in an attempt to prove how not bigoted' they are is shoehorning in and of itself.

The massive Danish gun companies are flooding the country with military weaponry, perverting democracy and stoking primal fear and prejudice to turn a dollar into a dollar ten!. True.

t1_du314jh	0	*	Russian plane missing after Moscow take off. So sad that it crashed but at least it isnt missing like the MH370. Since it's whole flight was over land it would have been seen by radar constantly. . Was it shot down over Malaysia by separatist militia?. Mh17 was the one that was shot down. It was shot down over Ukraine by separatists using Russian anti-aircraft missiles. All 298 people on board were killed.

[CNN article](https://www.google.se/amp/s/amp.cnn.com/cnn/2018/02/11/europe/russia-plane-crash/index.html).

Does Russia not have control Towers? How does this even happen?. Not every airport has a tower. Self announce is common amongst most airports in the US. Major airports however will have a tower.  With that being said it looks like ATC fucked up.

t1_du32lsd	1	*	Russian plane missing after Moscow take off. >The jet vanished from radar screens two minutes after it left Domodedovo Airport.  How is it possible ? Only two minutes.. Take off and landing are the most dangerous stages of a flight so that isn't a surprise. On take off its usually mechanical failure or badly stowed cargo.. If I remember right, similiar thing happened a few years ago in Russia when the plane of Lokomotiv Yaroslavl hockey team crashed. It was in the air for a very short perioid of time. Sad news.. That plane never got to any significant altitude because of pilot error right after take off.

Same here, but ultimately I have confidence in his awareness of the situation and what people are capable of finding out now days.

Yeah I also had to buy my uniform, and at my store the coffee was only free if we used our own travel mugs instead of the paper cups. They were more concerned about the cost of the paper cups than the coffee in them? That's some quality product there..

t1_duqffaw	0	*	Germany confirms $44.9 billion surplus and GDP growth in 2017. What the hell is a surplus?. Take a graph of the United States economy, now flip it up side down, this is a surplus. . Actually the American economy is still booming.... Which is why it didnt need a stimulus that increased wealth inequality.
t1_dupi3jf	1	*	Germany confirms $44.9 billion surplus and GDP growth in 2017. Y'all got any more of that fiscal responsibility? . US Conservatives are in power right now. We should be working on that deficit aaany time now..... Aaany second now.... It'll start trickling anytime now...
t1_dupgl8t	0	*	Germany confirms $44.9 billion surplus and GDP growth in 2017. Y'all got any more of that fiscal responsibility? . Not every country can run a surplus.  Germany is only able to do so because other countries run a deficit.. You mean they are shrewd investors and construct good policies. also they don't have much of a Navy/Air Force anymore so that helps, and is probably for the best. . This is entirely irrelevant.  
t1_duplcrs	0	*	Germany confirms $44.9 billion surplus and GDP growth in 2017. People in Germany can hate or dislike Merkel all they want but she's done an amazing job for the last decade or so.. She's an enemy for the German citizen. She cares about people from outside more than about the own country. Fuck her.. Come live in 'murica. That's the same message Trump pushed about Hillary. You'll like what he's doing for us!. Trump is something we would call Witzfigur in Germany.
t1_dupz8sx	1	*	Germany confirms $44.9 billion surplus and GDP growth in 2017. What will Germany do with that surplus?.

t1_duprm20	0	*	Germany confirms $44.9 billion surplus and GDP growth in 2017. Germany is in a unique situation that greatly benefits from the Euro. They have a much higher productivity rate of their workforce and thus favorable against every other country in Europe in trade.. They're standards of, productive, also aren't dictated by how cheaply they can make stuff.. Just how many emissions tests they can cheat   Das Auto. No way in hell they are the only ones...

t1_dtna1jv	1	*	House Intelligence memo released: What it says.

Yes, read the memo.. It's written by nunes and Trump it's fake
t1_dtmywo6	0	*	House Intelligence memo released: What it says. The memo proves what most people already suspected, The HRC campaign colluded with a foreign agent to try and influence the US presidential election.. Then they did a piss poor job considering the leaked DNC emails.. A DNC employee Seth Rich leaked the emails, Julian Assange the founder of WikiLeaks has admitted.. You do know that the Seth Rich conspiracy was debunked by the Dutch intelligence service who watched the Russians hack the DNC, right?
t1_dtn2fih	1	*	House Intelligence memo released: What it says. Thats it?. Four pages with five bullet points and zero evidence. Its almost like this memo was bs all along. Who wouldve thought..

Well what decisions did these 9 men make in their lives that is different than the 4 billion?. the 4 billion people are just lazy and dont want to work. anyone can get one of the richest men of the world if he works hard. . Well you wont get there by making bad decisions. you need to make very very bad decisions to get poor once youre rich.
t1_dsrf978	1	*	Singapore's crime rate is so low that many shops don't even lock up.. Must be nice. I wish my country was like Singapore. Such are merits of Confucian technocracy in contrast to western cultures where the people are encouraged to be wild.. It's also a city-state on a tiny piece of land that is relatively easy to police. It's nothing like The United States.. Exactly. Its 50 square miles in size and is a massively funded global hub of commerce and investment and transport. Comparing Singapore to the US is like comparing Manhattan to the US.
t1_dt7kc3j	1	*	Pope Francis: Fake news leads to the spread of 'arrogance and hatred'. I'm not trying to be edgy here, but I could say the same about religion throughout the ages. Not that I like fake news mind you. This just seems a bit like the pot calling the kettle black. . Which is another way to say: It is naive to believe that with the decline of religion the problems attributed to religion would go away as well. . I don't disagree with that. They are all human creations and, as such, subject to human fallacies and shortcomings. . It wasn't meant deprecating either, nor do I have a beef with religion.  It's just... a symptom of being human, in a way. 
t1_dt6kzyi	1	*	Pope Francis: Fake news leads to the spread of 'arrogance and hatred'. I would argue that silencing the news allows for a lot more hatred. Ignorance breeds arrogance.. Holding news outlets accountable for lies is not the same as silencing them.  . This is true, but in a world as complicated as the one we live in, with people that are willing to call anything that would make them look bad fake news, who decides what's true?. It's not relative/ambiguous at a certain point and we have gone way past that point. 
t1_dt6la8s	1	*	Pope Francis: Fake news leads to the spread of 'arrogance and hatred'. Have you heard the fake good news!? . > There is a god. . Sir, I'm afraid I'm going to have to cite you. We have regulations concerning bonfires that size.. Man, he just got the kindling ability too.
t1_dt8ecam	1	*	Pope Francis: Fake news leads to the spread of 'arrogance and hatred'. Hatred  leads to suffering. Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering.. GIVE IN TO YOUR ANGER. I hate sand.

Your system *might* be flawed.. It is. But to be fair this happens in quite a few place like the UK. First past the post systems do not work anymore, too many people live in tiny space. (Cities.)
t1_dugsq4y	1	*	Top U.S. officials tell the world to ignore Trumps tweets. Member of the world here. LOL no. You made him the president, and I will absolutely judge what he says in a globally-public forum.. I mean, some of us tried to not let him be our president.  We just got outvoted.  edit:  he won with votes people.  I don't care if they're electoral or popular.. We actually won by three million votes. I think it's important to always point that out.  Edit: Holy crap. I either struck a nerve or the Russians are online in full force tonight.  SAD!. we - must have voted for Trump...
t1_dugwmkn	1	*	Top U.S. officials tell the world to ignore Trumps tweets. Who is top us officials. Nobody named. So it didn't happen . I never found the qoute or any general reference to his tweeting in that article. Did you?. No. It doesn't say anything of the sort. 
t1_dugrpka	1	*	Top U.S. officials tell the world to ignore Trumps tweets. Probably should just ignore america in general for a while . Change our flag to  404 Error until we sort this cluster fuck out ....U0001f611. 500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR would be more appropriate. . I think our server is a steaming hunk of melted parts at this point.

Your system *might* be flawed.. The system doesn't account for half the voting population deciding to not to vote in the election.
t1_dugvkkk	1	*	Top U.S. officials tell the world to ignore Trumps tweets. Wasn't it confirmed just roughly half a year ago that Trump's tweets are offical presidential statements?. Yes. Spicer said they were in June of 2017 during a press briefing.. I miss old spicey. He may have been incompetent and a cog in a corrupt system but at least he provided some relief to the monotony of this stupid administration. Well if you love him...set him free. Atleast when it all collapses he will be far far away and free.

t1_ds8exr2	1	*	The US and South Korea just took a huge step toward peace with North Korea. The US is doing the opposite. Totally. Suspending military exercises during the Olympics is totally not a step towards peace.. I'm referring to the Trump tweets where he casually goads Kim Jong Un into nuclear war, we could do without that.. all according to keikaku:  >A serious problem in planning against American doctrine is that the Americans do not read their manuals, nor do they feel any obligation to follow their doctrine.
t1_dtccqm5	0	*	Israel urges Poland to change bill regarding its role in Nazi Holocaust. Let's wash history away. . Its not really washing history away. They only want it banned because saying Polish Death Camps sounds like Poland was the one behind the holocaust (which it was not). . To me instead of banning the phrase people should be educated about the meaning of it.  The fact that there were death camps in Poland doesn't change. . I understand your point, but does it not make more sense to say German Death Camps instead of Polish ones? It wasn't the polish people right...
t1_dtd5hc6	0	*	IKEA founder Ingvar Kamprad dies. It feel like something is missing . Probably the allen key . > Probably the allen key  I have several dozens you can have. . Found one in the passenger side map pocket in my car the other day.  Why in the hell was it in the car?
t1_dt5d43g	1	*	German man finds 80 meters of Berlin Wall. Thats crazy that they just missed an entire section of the wall, even more so *80 meters* of it. I dearly hope they preserve it and make it a historical site . Berlin has a lot of the remains of the Berlin Wall throughout the city centre.. I know, but they somehow didnt know that this was still there. Thats what makes it amazing to me . Ah, I misunderstood.
t1_du21m2a	0	*	Trump tells Pentagon he wants a military parade. And why not? Our military is all volunteer and would be proud to put on a parade. All the special interests get parades; why not the most powerful military in the world? . Why not is because military persons have literally said military servicemen DON'T like parades. And that even they think its a waste of money. Read the article before you comment . All of them?. Oh for fucks sake don't be dumb 
t1_du7gnd2	1	*	Indias forest and tree cover rises 1% (by 8,021 sq. km) since 2015. Someone's gonna be the guy who posts BUT this is not the same as old growth and i'm just gonna go ahead and respond with BUT it's still better than nothing! Go india. . Whats old growth?. Something, you need to have it looked at by a Doctor!. Hahaha
t1_dt2anpl	1	*	Whistleblower claims accountants turned a blind eye to Dubai firm he says painted 5 tons of gold to look like silver. This should be big news for the sake of public influence for justice. . Instead, very soon this poor sod will likely show up with a clear case of heart attack. Inside of a sports bag.. Naw he will suicide himself with 2 gun shot wounds to the back of the head.. To be fair, it will be a double barrel.

t1_dtlervn	1	*	Chinese Navy ship reportedly spotted with a deadly electromagnetic railgun fitted.. I don't really know why a landing ship would need a railgun on it but I don't serve the navy so who knows. It seems much more likely to be a conventional cannon to me.. If it is a railgun then it would be a highly experimental version. I'm guessing a landing craft would be a good test-bed - plenty of empty space for power and instruments and stuff like that. . that makes more sense. I'd like to keep an eye on any news of testing then.. Same - I love reading about military tech. If we don't hear anything about this one in the coming months though, I guess assume it was a failure. 
t1_dtlryzr	1	*	Chinese Navy ship reportedly spotted with a deadly electromagnetic railgun fitted.. as opposed to the non-deadly version?. Chinese vessel spotted with totally harmless regular cannon. . Instead of bullets, it shoots out nerf balls!. Harmless nerf balls filled with melamine laced explosives.
t1_dtmnm00	1	*	Chinese Navy ship reportedly spotted with a deadly electromagnetic railgun fitted.. as opposed to the non-deadly version?. The nonlethal version shoots rubber rails.. Ofcourse the rubber balls need to be contained within a metal cylinder  for it to be possible to fire them.... You understand where I was going with that, then.
t1_duwenrr	0	*	Russian Students Threatened With 'Repressions' After Mentioning Navalny. So? Pretty much the same in the west if you mention Trump or Jordan Peterson.. >  Jordan Peterson.  Nobody even knows who that is.. Same as with Navalny.. Are you talking about the Navalny with more than 2million twitter followers? Or a different one that nobody knows about?
t1_dtvdlun	1	*	Iran executed 3 children in January. misleading title. Isn't the title describing exactly what happened?. No, they were all minors (not necessarily children) when they committed the crimes for which they were convicted.   It doesn't seem that any of them were minors at the time of their execution.. Oh yeah, that's correct. It seems like I didn't skim the whole article.

Fixed  . It's not stolen if consent was given.
t1_duc8drl	1	*	Japan, the United States and the European Union are considering jointly filing a case against China at the World Trade Organization over Chinese rules that effectively force foreign companies to transfer technologies to domestic firms, The Yomiuri Shimbun has learned.. I wish this post had as many up votes as the '60.000 tree planting in china'.  Not very impressive anyway bc India planted 50 million last year.. >I wish this post had as many up votes as the '60.000 tree planting in china'.    Why?  . Your question is almost ridiculous.  ...  as are your over 30 posts in this thread taking sides with an anti democratic country that kicks human right to the dirt.. The dude is white knighting so hard for china.
t1_dud0qse	1	*	Japan, the United States and the European Union are considering jointly filing a case against China at the World Trade Organization over Chinese rules that effectively force foreign companies to transfer technologies to domestic firms, The Yomiuri Shimbun has learned.. It's interesting because the US used to complain about the same practice being done in Japan. . Our economy is R&D based now. We spend hundreds of billions, possibly 1T, on R&D every year.. We spend more on marketing. It's actually quite sad. . If the English are a nation of shopkeepers, America is a nation of salesmen
