No, why should WE match them is my question . Deterrence? Because I don't want to fight a future war with Russia. . Ah. What is holding them up to steamrole us now?

The independence vote was unconstitutional after all.. The part where they were beating nonviolent dissidents was pretty frickin corrupt. I don't think that meets the definition of corruption.  > dishonest or fraudulent conduct by those in power, typically involving bribery.

Everyone's gobbing over cryptocurrency, and here I am just appreciating the fact the damn thing is 23 million digits long and yet you can't cleanly divide it.. You can divide it by 1  Edit: This is clearly a joke. But only 1. Thats what makes it prime. . You can also divide it by itself.... That's also what makes it prime. It's only divisible my itself and one.  That's the definition of a prime number. And by .5. The definition of a prime number says whole number factors so fractions and decimals are not the part of that

t1_ds9a112	1	*	The largest ever prime number has just been discovered, which is 23 249 425 digits long.. Disappointingly 23,249,425 is not a prime number.. The prime is precisely 2^(77,232,917)-1 and 77,232,917 *is* a prime.. This actually is much better. Thats just the definition of a mersenne prime. 2^p -1 where p is prime.  So people don't plug random numbers into the function and see, they only use primes.. Oooooh!!!! I thought it was just (2^n)-1 that makes a certain sense though. Why does using only primes make sense?. If n is not prime, then you can factor 2^(n)-1. Always. [See this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_prime#About_Mersenne_primes) for more info.

Sorry to burst your bubble but nothing will come of this, they will not get rid of the nukes it's a non starter.. Of course they won't. And they should not.

And then there's Operation Merlin. The great conspiracy might be Iran is really a US ally. . No, the Iranians claimed to hack a US RQ-170 drone and forced it to land.  Most likely, the drone crashed in Iran and the regime picked up the pieces.. The thing wasnt in pieces when they showed it off, that leaves hacking as the only possible way of taking down that drone and keeping it in one piece.. I do believe this is solid evidence that you don't have a very active imagination!. The US president ask for them to give it back! why would he bother if its in pieces?!. Because scuttling technology so that your enemies can't gain from it is something that every nation has done forever.   .

Live in an actual geopolitically valuable third world country for a bit and you will understand, America is the worst influence out of the three major powers.. I actually do, and America is not that bad. It is way better when you compare it to how countries/people were treated by the communist autocratic countries (USSR and China).

You have to look at the overall trend.. And the trend says the earth has been getting warmer since the end of the ice age. It hasn't been getting warmer this quickly until the Industrial revolution, we also understand the scientific process of how modern industry makes the earth warmer, it isn't just a guess..

t1_dtzil2c	0	*	The United States does not plan to contribute any money at a conference in Kuwait next week to fund Iraqs reconstruction drive after the war against Islamic State forces, U.S. and Western officials said, a move critics say could deal a new blow to American standing internationally.. First the US gets rid of the Army (which causes ISIS) then the US isn't going to help rebuild which is going to further destabilize the country. . Invading Iraq is what started the mess, and then not intervening in Syria is what made it worst.  Deciding which shots to take, and not to take, is critical to winning.. Your delusional of you think the us hasn't interfered in Syria. Not enough at the outset. Obama's biggest foreign policy blunder was his red line bluff with syria... and the problem wasn't drawing the line, rather the problem was that it was a bluff.. The problem was that they interfered too much at that beginning... Who do you think was originally arming that rebels? . Iran armed one side, Saudis the other.. You honestly beleive the US wasn't screwing around behind the scenes too?

Why don't we Marshall plan it and help rebuild instead of Afghanistan it* . We did.  The Marshall plan cost $140 billion in today's dollars, and we spent $60+ billion rebuilding Iraq before ISIS.  Now it'll take around $150 billion to rebuild what was recently lost.. That's really not that much. Fairly sure germany spends 40bn  annually to deal with the refugee crisis, and the Iraq war cost more than 2 trillion.. Iraq was took a decade and thousands of our lives, though.. And over a hundred thousand Iraqis died because of your invasion.. Just because of our invasion? How many of them were killing each other before we invaded?  Just to be clear I am vehemently against the invasion of Iraq. For many reasons. That just isn't one of them.. Hundreds of thousands of innocent deaths isn't one of them? What the fuck? Iraq had NOTHING to do with 9/11. Iraq was an ally of the US, bought tons of US weapons, until Bush Sr. backstabbed them.

If he has finished developing his nuclear arsenal, it's in his best interests to normalize relations. His regime is basically immune to the threat of an outside attack now. . Immune. It won't happen. Leaders outside of NK value their citizens to some degree and won't be willing to risk killing them..

Regressive policies and hateful rhetoric by leaders such as Trump, Putin, and Xi undermining rights worldwide, according to Amnesty International's annual human rights report.. Whats rights has anyone in the USA lost? . Well, we lost the right to an open and free internet a few months ago. There are assaults on women's reproductive rights.  Threats to US citizens' rights are not non-existent.. Open and free internet is not a right.  Rights cannot depend on someone elses labor. I agree that it should be accessible for all though. . By your definition, the 2nd amendment can't be a right. Unless you plan to make your own firearms.. You have a right to obtain your own firearms. You dont have a right to make someone give you one. Its a pretty basic distinction . You have the right to obtain a free and open internet. You don't have the right to make someone give you internet access.   I don't think you understand what I meant by 'free and open.'. How are they making the internet not free?

This is a terrible decision.  The sandbags will only make them stronger.  They'll be able to bench press their teachers by the time they are adults.. imagine how much faster they will be too, when they finally take off the vests.. In my experience running with weights is a terrible idea. Ive never seen any serious runner doing it or recommending it.. Except for the entire military.. They dont train just to run fast, they train to run fast with 40kg of luggage on their backs and heavy boots on their feet. If thats your goal then maybe some training with weight is a good idea.. Generally the military doesn't run with packs. They do Ruck marches, sometimes at a pretty quick Tempo, but fast walking / marching is a little bit different than running.. Of course, very few people can run with 40kg of additional weight for any length of time.   But isnt there lots of scrambling around and sprinting with full gear as well?

When hydrazine explodes it's yellow not orange/red . Is is actually a combination of both, the rocket booster in question uses a hypergolic mixture of Dinitrogentetraoxide and unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine..

Not surprising. Many seekimg refuge from the Germans were turned away and sent to their deaths, including a boat of Jewish refugees that landed right here in the US.   Never again my ass.  . Shanghai offered to take an unlimited number of European Jews, but they decided they'd rather live in Germany than move to China. Bad choice.. Fleeing to another war zone doesn't seem too much better. I suppose it depended on what part of China they ended up. Remember, Japan was actively butchering China at the time. . Especially as Japan was allied with the Nazis.. The Japanese had a weird relationship with the Nazis due to the fact that both of them were fighting wars on racial grounds.  The Japanese actually shielded the Jews.. And some [Nazis actually shielded the Chinese](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Rabe).  Funny how they could both see the evil in each other's actions but not their own.. I'm sure that much of the situation was geopolitically motivated. Similar to how immigration quotas to the US were eased for people coming from communist countries during the Cold War era.

Israel only cares about Israel. . Israel only cares about the overwhelmingly large portion of Israel that agrees with how Israeli government is operating.  . Thats.... are you criticisizing a democracy for following public opinions?. Nazi Germany was overwhelmingly in favor of Hitler's anti jew policies to. Didn't make it right. . Fair point.. Maybe democracy is overrated?. Democracy is the best simply because the people are responsible for the way the government acts. It's hard to blame the government for something when you are the one that put them there.

t1_dtfjze5	0	*	Malaysias top court said in a landmark decision Monday both parents must consent to the religious conversion of a minor, ruling unanimously in favor of a Hindu woman whose ex-husband converted their three children to Islam without telling her.. Father: I shall decide which God you believe in.  Court: No, that's for the mother to decide  -- We're all crazy. That's not what the court said - it's for both parents to agree on, not just the mother. Why does the child have no say?. When have children ever had a say in their own upbringing?. Religion should be like college, they can choose it or not at age 18.. Do you extend that to ideology in general?. Well, some are unavoidable, such as capitalism or socialism.    But religion has no proof, and in fact, makes claims that would be considered insane except enough people believe them.

Werent some other canadian billionaires killed like a month ago, maybe less.. It's the same couple, they're just confirming it was murder and not suicide.  Edit: Concluding, not confirming. These are private investigators, not police.. Private investigators hired by the family are stating this, the police have yet to classify their deaths as murder. . Why do the police need to verify it? just curious.  Surely private investigators would be pretty accurate and qualified, right?. One is being paid by the family.. But aren't the PI former Toronto Homicide Dect?. Being a cop let alone a former cop doesn't make you a bastion of morality or immune to pressure by your employers.

Why does this newspaper describe him as a powerful capitalist? Sounds like this paper is an old Soviet Union propaganda pamphlet.. Just calling a spade a spade. Anything you infer from that is just a sign of the times.. lmao 'just calling a spade a spade' is shit ive heard racists use to rationalize their logic and unwillingness to look in things. signs of the times.. wait so you heard a 'racist' use a random idiom, and you're using that as evidence someone using the same idiom is racist?. how is it random? it's the same.. I mean, it's not an idiom that is related by inherently racist nature, it's seemingly unrelated beyond that OP heard it used by someone they thought was racist. no it's an ignorant device to avoid looking at the heart of the problem. 'calling a spade a spade' sounds like some archie bunker shit.

Trudeau says a lot of things. *sigh*  I never liked him, and I knew he'd be mediocre at best. I voted for him, because I absolutely cannot stand Harper.  The choices were, Bad, and, Horrible.. Yeah, we had the same thing here. Nobody on the left will admit it though. Lots of people on the left admit that Clinton was a bad candidate.  . Well thats just cuz everyone knows she's terrible. Right, left, that's a bipartisan issue lol . I'd still take her over Trump any day of the week and twice on Sunday!. Wouldn't have mattered much honestly.

Why not make it 0% then?. We already don't tax people below a certain income; I would have no problem raising that threshold *significantly*.. I agree. Everyone. .

But Muslims dont integrate because Islam bad, of course.. plus, it's better to be butthurt than to just deal with it.. Just deal with the compromise between your childrens immortal souls and their education.  Thats an impossible position.. Yeah, we shouldn't have to choose between our children's immortal souls and having to learn about evolution and condoms, either! /s. Theyve enrolled their kids in those schools.  With non Muslims.  Theyre obviously willing to make accommodations- why not embrace people who are actually trying?
t1_dtcjhpp	0	*	The Amazon rainforest is being burned down faster than ever before to plant fields of corn and soy for processed foods. They clear land for cattle and others too.. Also, soy and corn is in the majority of cow feed. Brazil produces 22% of the world's beef. It's okay though, it's not like we need forests that absorbs 20% of the worlds CO2 annually.. But let's all attack Canada's oil industry.. Just because others are doing worse deeds than Canadas oil industry doesnt mean they are not bad . They're literally a world leader for environmental standards.  Yet I see people say we should shut down our industry and just import. Like ????  The motto in Canada seems to just be #notinmybackyard.. Im sure more people want to move into cleaner energy than fossil fuels . Yet we import millions of dollars in oil a month from Saudi because pipelines are bad

Also, soy and corn is in the majority of cow feed. Brazil produces 22% of the world's beef. It's okay though, it's not like we need forests that absorbs 20% of the worlds CO2 annually.. Trees could always be planted elsewhere.... It's not just trees. Rainforests are a climate that host rare flora and fauna that simply do not and can not exist anywhere else. Once a rainforest is gone, they're gone forever.. Ok, well we need solutions that don't rely on corrupt governments to do the right thing.  I don't know what those are, but complaining about it isn't getting things done.. Suggesting that trees could just be planted elsewhere won't help either.. It won't solve every problem, but at least part of the ecosystem could be preserved this way.  I'm open to any better suggestion.
t1_dtcgjdp	0	*	The Amazon rainforest is being burned down faster than ever before to plant fields of corn and soy for processed foods. Why isn't multi level farming a big thing yet? We would literally make a ton more food, with a lot less water, little to no pesticides, and less land. . Difficult to beat the efficiency of a field with a building attempting to recreate the conditions of a field, particularly for low value bulk crops.. Maybe you can beat the efficiency, but you can't beat the set-up cost.. It costs practically nothing to set up high tunnels and you get a partially controlled environment out of it.  Vertical farming is only feasible in specific circumstances where land is at a premium.. It costs exactly nothing to cut down trees and throw seeds on the ground. . They have a great growing season so it's not like they need much else.  In the US we only have year round in areas of southern CA and AZ.. >They have a great growing season so it's not like they need much else.   John has a wife and kids and a six figure income.  It's not like John needs more money...why would he try to make more money?

The EU should block all sales until they pay, see how quickly the money will be deposited then. I mean they can take peoples wages in some spots. So why not do it do companies.. Because you can't throw a company in jail, and the executives in America will never be extradited to Europe.. Corporate crime is a thing in the EU and the US has extradition treaties.  So yeah - guess again.. So just like Germany extraditing all those Volkswagen execs huh?. If the US were to request extradition.. Except Germany doesn't extradite its citizens outside the EU. The US can issue an international arrest warrant so they would be arrested and extradited to the US if they ever leave Germany.

No I don't want conflict in those regions, nor did I even remotely elude to that. But Trump is not going to solve them. . He seems more willing than any past President.. Really?

I've heard Fugu does not even taste that good or have much nutritional value. Outside of it being a delicacy its a pretty pointless food to eat.  Seems like a big risk for virtually no pay off.. I was highly skeptical myself before eating one. It was much better than I expected to be honest. Doesn't beat salmon sushi though.. the salmon in Japan will kill you if it is not from outside Japan, just a heads up.. Gonna need more info on this, please.. They are extremely violent and nationalistic.. They fold their fins 1000 times for greater sharpness. Tried to eat one at my local sushi place the other day, and it pulled a knife out on me.

No country on earth mine as much bitcoin as China does.. Can't tell if this is sarcasm or not.. Which part does it sound like a  sarcasm?. >They are stopping because they've pretty much emptied the mine.. There is a limited amount of bit coin in existence so the analogy does stand I suppose.. That was my point. It isn't close to being empty, not until 2140. Although about 99% will be mined by around 2032.
t1_dsd6bgp	1	*	China wants an orderly exit from bitcoin mining. It's an environmental disaster, I can see why it should be regulated.. I wonder if it's more or less of an environmental disaster than physically mining gold. . Gold is at least a tangible, useful, reusable material. Crypto currency is really just arbitrary value assigned to an idea.. Useful in what way?  Being stockpiled in bank vaults is useful?. There's gold in your computer for example.. Phone, many electronics also. It's not just... a goldbar.. Yeah ok, but I'm going to go out on a limb and guess that the value of gold has almost nothing to do with its use in commercial products.. What does that have to do with the price of it? We're talking about the usability of gold vs a cryptocoin.

Unlike Bitcoin, it has many uses aside from it's innate value.. Nope, silicon and copper are what made computer run. Gold is only used for the connector parts. . And connectors are needed to have the computer run, no?. Compare to the rest of the machine? The need for them is miniscule.

And France is a very minor portion of said economy.. It's not just France though, you have to trade with all of the EU, not just 1 country in it. France holds veto power so it is a big deal.. And what do you think would happen if trade deals with the US fell through because France alone decided to Veto them? To put it in perspective the US is Germany's largest export market. . France has veto power for EU trade deals. You get that right? . I do. France using its veto to stop US trade deals would harm the EU far more than the US since they rely on the US more than the US does on them.

Building a wall is about as good of an idea as arming teachers...which is to say it's fucking stupid and won't accomplish anything.. You mean you don't want schools to turn into a war zone during school shootings?! B-b-but then when will I ever be able to use muh ar-15?  /s. Dont you see that arming people who never wanted to be armed and by and large arent comfortable with the idea will deter all future school shootings?. I didn't realize the proposal was forcing every teacher to be armed, as opposed to being an option.   Oh what? Nobody would be **forced** to carry? Wild. . So then almost no one would? Genius! School shootings solved!. If even 5% start carrying these shooters will target the next easiest gun free zone. Remember these people are cowards who want easy kills for the infamy. If it's truly a mental health issue and has nothing to do with guns, won't they just blow up school buses or something?

The first two miles is in process of being built already . They're replacing a 2 mile section thst was built in the 90s. Again no funding is in place to build anything else beyond the 2 miles. So no construction has not begun on Trump's proposed wall. . Its a WALL replacing a fence so yes a WALL has started. .

It's a lot simpler than that. Just don't visit websites you don't like.  That way you won't be offended and other people won't have their freedom of speech violated.. These people want to round up jews,etc and gas them.. If they do those things, the police will arrest them. If you don't like to hear about their ideas, visit CNN instead of their website.. Kinda hard to do that when they like to do things like murder people.. If they are murdering people then the police should arrest them. If they are arresting them for running a website then they are obviously not killing anyone.

If its blue fin, they will specify and charge more, I promise. . Exactly. I don't think tuna sushi in the west is a major market for bluefin at all. Nor does it need to be, seeing as most people are perfectly happy eating more sustainable fish.

He then promised to be a responsible nuclear power. He thinks he has some leverage now. . One successful missile in a non-combat setting? Given those have been around for over 50 years, I'm not sure how much leverage that really gives.. They didn't have them before, now they do.

t1_duus7fy	1	*	Trump says Filipinos dont have drug problem because they kill dealers  report. Maybe soon the USA won't have a problem with a shitty, corrupt president either.... What makes you think Trump is corrupt?. He's a politican.  He was/is a tycoon in the construction industry.  You don't make it in any business without taking and giving a few favors.. This strikes me as very flimsy reasoning.  Being successful in business doesn't necessarily imply someone is corrupt.. > This strikes me as very flimsy reasoning  Says the guy who wants justice for Seth Rich. You don't give a single flying fuck about reasoning. . You don't want justice for Seth Rich?. Yes, and spreading BS is not helping that.

t1_dtxigyy	1	*	GOP lawmakers take aim at WHO agency over Roundup ingredient. I dare GOP lawmakers to take a shot of Roundup on a daily basis. The issue is whether Roundup is a carcinogen, not whether it is safe for human consumption.  No one is suggesting cracking open a round one with the boys.. No, but they are suggesting putting in on our food without proper warning.. I hope you wash your food. They put poop in it you know.. I do, but fun fact, poop does not cause cancer and stick to food.. Uh poop does have a strong correlation to cancer.  Inadequate fiber intake is a risk factor for colorectal cancer because your poop sits inside you for much longer than it should. . .... that is not the same as roundup and you know it.
t1_ds5x3ci	0	*	After missing Model 3 deliveries by 87% in Q3, Tesla have now missed their already halved Q4 production goals by another 47% - Back in July, Elon Musk said Tesla would be able to produce 20,000 Model 3s per month by December 2017, but it produced just 2,425 during the whole quarter. This is gonna be soooo good for the established car giants to catch up in electric cars. And they won't be facing the same production issues that Tesla does . deleted  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^0.9400  [The Story of the Hoover Dam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNQ4-Cm5AhY54156). GM has a mass market cheap EV currently with the Bolt.  They sold 20,000 in 2017.  It's the only production EV currently available with decent range until the model 3 is actually available.. But it's so ugly. Yeah, that it is.  But if you want an EV with over 200mi range under 40k it's the only option right now.  I'm hopeful for more competition the in the next year or two though.. The new 2nd generation Nissan Leaf hits 150 miles and starts a hair under $30k. Between that, a Bolt, and a Model 3, it's some really good competition.. Live in the Bay Area. Aside from Priuses everywhere, the Leaf is actually a pretty popular EV. The newer models will probably sell pretty well.

Also NK is a proxy for China. So it would be a reduction of western influence in Korea. . you give china too much credit.  the fat boy purged the chinese influence when he executed his uncle..

Vietnam don't provide any socialist welfare for its people and more than other capitalism countries.  . Thats also not true.

Funny how making everthing gender neutral seems so much more of a moral concern than selling weapons to Duterte.  Beggars belief.. What weapons are we selling? . Have you read the headline on here? O_o. yea we are selling civilian grade transport helicopters not weapons . Directly under the headline, in case that's all you read: *Trudeau has sold 16* ***combat*** *helicopters worth $185m to the Philippine air force...*. The Canadian military has no attack helicopters, so I am curious what ones it is selling.. Not sure what you mean by attack helicopters, but the Griffons can indeed be armed.

It really does feel like the US and other world powers will dump the Kurds at a moments notice if someone tells them too. Today it is Turkey, yesterday it was Saddam. . Tools are meant to be used and then discarded when they no longer serve a purpose. When you willingly become someone's tool, you should not be surprised with the outcome. . I know that but the US needed a force to fight ISIS and the people there needed to fight ISIS so it wasn't exactly a tool-user relationship. You mean the same ISIS that was supplied by the US? How did that work out for them?. Supplied by the US via the Iraqi's running away and leaving their weapons behind.. Did you forget a /s somewhere in there or are you being serious?. If you think that the US actually supplied ISIS you are the one being silly.

That's exactly what happened in the US and what is happening everywhere Putin turns his gaze. It's no coincidence that hateful alt conservative groups and nazis have sprouted up everywhere.. Sheer isnt exactly an Alt- right person. If they wanted something like that they needed to interfere with the conservative leadership race right from the beginning. . They use more than a lone candidate to infiltrate, and they also infiltrate whatever side you support to make it more extreme or to distract from within.. With our parliamentary system can they really influence much? Serious question.   Unless they already have and thats how we got Trudeau. . They influence every single decision that can be voted on, whether through propaganda to influence citizens or through impersonating the populace to influence represenatives.. Never thought about personating the population. Interesting if they have the capability to influence polls.

I have no water but at least I can die of dehydration wherever I want. Why exactly is Apartheid the 'solution' so many redditors go with for South Africa's problems when a simple change in the ruling party would likely suffice? . Lot of crazy racists .

t1_dtssjx7	1	*	Russia sentenced 43 people to jail over online posts last year, a rights group said Monday, warning that the country is slowly criminalising internet use as the security service tightens its grip. And some people (usually ignorant) think the US Bill of Rights is overkill.. so many problems have the root cause of not studying history. To be fair a large portion of the framers of the constitution did not want to include the Bill of Rights, which is why they are amendments.  . Source?. Federalists v. anti federalist papers. . In short, a lot believed that a Bill of Rights would actually *limit* rights, because the government would only have to respect those that were listed. . That I believe is what the 10th amendment is for.

It still isn't fully ratified but so far as tariffs go it's operating. Isn't fully ratified and has no deal with China. If America pulls out of Nafta it will hurt Canada more then America. . Isn't fully ratified but is still operating. Wish everyone failed like that.. Dare we talk about China and the social justice reforms your prime Minister was hoping for? .

Whenever I look at maps, Mongolia is labeled distinctly, but also within China. What's the deal there? Is it like a special province or what?. Nah those map makers probably disregard our independence. We got it in the early 20th century with help from russia. Oh really? Cool. Bet those maps were made in China anyway. So how is Mongolia? I never hear about the goings on of it, and I almost never see you guys in the wild. We're strugglin between two giants.

That doesn't mean that Afghanistan belongs to the US though. It's the Afghan people's land, not US land.

No. Its nowhere near as black and white like that, and the only people that portray it as such are uninformed or edgelords. . It's the majority view. To think otherwise would be edgy.

My mom is in Kabul right now and always tells me that the number reported deaths are way Lower and she says close to double that are dead. And I'm just telling her to get the hell out of there.  . Why she there in the first place. Trying to sell her childhood home. . Get her the f out of there. She's way too stubborn. I've been trying for months . I hope she gets to safety soon. Wishing you and her all the best.. Thank you!

Edit: I don't care what religion these people follow, the fact remains that hundreds of families are affected and lost loved ones.. no value for human life: taliban. There's a reason why the vast majority of Afghans prefer the current government over the Taliban. The Taliban are some real assholes.

Theyre a bunch of big meanies, thats what!

There's a world of differece. . The Taliban were also fighting in their own land against foreigners, while the US military goes to foreign lands to fight the natives. That's a world of difference.. We aren't talking about them fighting troops or lashing out at Americans. They are killing local fellow Afghans and Muslims. Let's not romanticize what they do and how they fight. . I would *never* romanticize the Taliban. They are awful, vile people.

The person he replied to never said the US was just as bad as the taliban. . He's not being dense. The guy he replied to is implying we aren't different than the taliban.. No, what he said was that we don't value the lives of civilians killed from collateral damage. Which is true. How many thousands of civilians did we kill last year alone?

Both are utter shit, but at least TD wears its bias on its sleeve.. They actively ban you for not sucking one dudes dick. Yeah, I guess at that point might as well be open about it, but you dont get props lol.. They say clearly in the rules that they're for Trump supporters only and the subreddit is called the_donald. How is it not clear that the sub is not meant for bipartisan discussion?. It is perfectly clear.

There is a lung cancer vaccine available in Cuba for many years. . Allegedly . It's been used successfully for a long time in cuba. FDA has been testing it since 2016 on people who have already had chemotherapy.. for people who already had cancer??. Yes, that is the criteria still
t1_dtoqzu1	1	*	Oxford University professor Tariq Ramadan charged with raping two women following arrest in Paris. The good thing about this is that it opens up a tenure position at a good university. Hopefully this helps with the glut of PhD holders with no prospects of tenure.. Lolololol.  Helps how? It will give literally one person a new position.  Prolly gonna be 4k+ applications for that job, but it's still just one spot..... One spot is one more than zero! Hopefully this will inspire more tenure holders to rape and/or similar misconduct and subsequent disgrace and resignation of their positions. . Pretty sure it's not really cool to advocate that anything inspires rape.... Mythology features rape all over, yet Thor Ragnarok grossed over $500 in America.... I'm pretty sure the Norse gods weren't nearly as rapey and shitty as the Greek gods.. Ok, well Wonder Woman made a lot of money, too

This was a reply to a comment about Assange escaping by flying illegally through British airspace.. we'd be shooting down an ecuadorian plane in british airspace. i'm pretty sure that isn't friendly to either countries. I don't think the UK authorities would authorize a flight to take off from the Ecuadorian embassy... He can be shot down by a British fighter if that makes you feel any better.. again, that smells an awful lot like an international incident, as he'd likely be flying with a diplomat.

This kind of elitism got Trump elected  Edit: to make things clear, I wasn't saying opposing pedophile was elitist. I was saying the snide comment about Alabama was elitist.. I lived in Alabama it is a backward shithole outside of a couple cities.. Huntsville is only one city

There are things called elections where you can do exactly that. . Thats the plan.  2018 will be a blue wave and Trump will be impeached.. Then you're ethically worse than Trump.. How so?

Lobbying is a group of people pooling their money together to communicate with lawmakers. . Bribery is not equivalent to free speech. . Bribery is already illegal. Lobbying is not bribery.. Lobbying is effectively a form of bribery.   Especially when you can say Do things favorable to my business or Ill donate a ton of money to your primary competitor who will play ball.. You could also be a constituent and say if you're not going to implement policy x, I'm going to donate to your opponent. Should that be illegal? .

Makes you wonder what else their leaders could do to them. Conditioning goes a long way. It's exhaustion.  Edit: by exhaustion I mean we have been outraged so much that the bar has lowered. We need James Cameron to come through and do something about it ^/s. It's not exhaustion if they didn't even bother to do something about it.   It's apathy.. Trump cured the left's apathy. Check the number of people (and especially women) running for office this year.. I'll believe it when I'll see it; the voting turnout is said to be poor for midterms.. It is also very poor for off-midterm years (2017, 2019), as well as for special elections. But the turnout rate last year for both was far above anything they expected.

But doing it to an infant who can't give consent it somehow ok?. And yet, the large majority of u that had it done as infants without our consent are perfectly fine with that....so please don't speak for us.. Most of the females in my family underwent clitoral hood reduction/removal at birth, as we come from Singapore originally. We have no complaints either but people still insist it's mutilation.. Ya the word carries a shock factor that's supposed to make us feel bad. It's actually a really shitty hyperbole that is super insulting to people that have been circumcised . >super insulting to people that have been circumcised   I don't feel insulted that people call circumcision what it is. Why should you?. Because mutilation implies a massive anatomical change, usually in a violent and disorganized way. But circumcision is none of those things

I definitely prefer our system.  https://visitsweden.com/about-the-right-of-public-access/. Why?. I guess the main reasons are a) it's free and b) you can camp anywhere, even on private land.. National Parks being free in the US would kill them. They are already overburdened and can't really handle any more visitors. We are already up to 331 million visits a year.

We once had a lobster that was too big to fit it in the steamer.  The cook broke it in half while it was still alive to cram it in there.  Haunts me to this day... . Ive seen that, my preferred method Is a knife though the head then cooked which kills them instantly . I know it doesn't mean much but thank you for preventing them from being in agony.. When you think about it, since we've got other options, we could probably not kill it at all. . You are what's wrong with vegans and vegetarians.. That makes no sense at all. 
t1_dsjgih2	0	*	Switzerland rules lobsters must be stunned before boiling. How do you stun a lobster? I would think dropping them into a pot of boiling water would work.. A small needle in the right place severs the spine/brain stem IIRC.. My friend's wife learned that in culinary school. You slip the knife between the armor plates.. This is the more correct answer. I was thinking of frogs in school vivisections in retrospect.. You vivisected frogs in school? Unless you're talking about medical school, you had a way cooler high school than me. many highschools do this in biology class. they used to do suckling pigs, but frogs are cheaper, and people don't find them as cute.   . Well, we dissected frogs in 8th grade, but a vivisection would be pretty damn traumatizing  (A dissection is performed on a dead organism; a vivisection on a live one)

Nope, actually there isn't. They test for that over several decades. . Have tested or are still testing?. Well it's always still being tested, but before approval to market they have to test the product for decades, hence why gmo companies can be protective of their product.

Wont be long before insect resistant GM crops become necessary just to maintain yields.  Bring it on. The sooner we can eliminate the use of pesticides the better.  Edit: 1 letter. As the world urbanizes we'll see more and more indoor farming anyhow, making pesticides irrelevant completely. That day can't come soon enough.. Not being a dick but take a close look at your house plants. . Indoor farming goes a little bit further than putting a bunch of plants between four walls and a roof.. But not nearly as far as you think they will, most farms are land based and will remain so for many reasons, #1 being efficiency.. Except no. Indoor farms yield 75 times more food per square feet than conventional farming, and do so with up to 97% less water. . For greater cost per unit. That's the important metric for efficiency in business.  Not to mention that indoor farming involves a lot of upfront costs.

Did you know gmos have reduced pesticide use, and pollution from farming practises?.

This allows farmers to kill weeds with less overall pesticides.

But if they actually fire Muller at this point, we can have some real serious civil unrest. I mean, like something the States has never seen.. Well, you know, since that time a bunch of them seceded, followed by 5 years of bloodshed. . It may end up being worse than that. In which case, it WOULD be the most civil unrest that the United States has ever seen.. No, it won't be worse than the civil war. That's a silly thing to say.. How can you be sure? Weapons are different nowadays.. The civil war has the highest American death count of any war we've been involved in, including WWII. No, Trump firing Muller will not exceed that.

Secondly, his party didn't win the general election, so that proves one of your three claims wrong.. Lol thats what every neolib says. You lost. He won. He gained more power.

This level of beastly irresponsibility and incitement on Trump's twitter is par for the course. . At 7:37 PM, Fox News chyron read that Kim Jong-un says he has a nuclear button. Two minutes later, President Donald Trump tweeted in an apparent response.. Are you trying to counter my comment with this as some sort of justification? Because you're not doing a very convincing job.  Trump tweeting this is nuts. Period.. No. I'm reinforcing the crazy. FoxNews leads him around by the nose. . Ah, my bad then.

How someone in his position delivers a message is extremely important.  Trump supporters seem to love brash, over the top, absurd delivery methods so a nude, Trump dance would be great, no?. So would you flip your views on Trump if one day decided to deliver speeches on the level of Obama, even if the summary of the message was we're nuking someone?

My 13 and 11 year old kids just face palmed when I showed them this tweet. They then argued about which of the two of them would make a better president.  I said stop arguing either of you would.. Since this is Reddit, I'm going to point out how much it bothers me that you said 13 and 11 instead of 11 and 13. .

I guess Republicans don't care about states rights all of a sudden (nevermind, they stopped caring when they attacked 'sanctuary city' laws or potentially stopped caring before that).. This is literally him telling the states that the feds will stay out of it i.e. Colorado is going to follow Colorado laws on wee. So how does your comment make sense?. oh wow the spin. How is that spin? I'm not saying it's going to be good or bad, but it's going from Federal oversight to state oversight.   I now see he edited it to a different comment from before.. I didn't change my comment fundamentally and added the parenthesis part. Pretty sure you're the one who didn't read the article btw.. Yeah, cause I can't tell the difference between the power given to the State AG and the federal AG.. What? The state AGs aren't even involved here. This is 100 percent federal.

But you should because it's places like these where your food is coming from. . As someone else said, I'd gladly pay more money for meat if I could know the animals were treated well.. Could you give up meat? Because not paying for meat and animal products seems to me to be the simplest and most effective way to solve this problem.. I could, but I won't. I mostly only eat chicken, fish, and turkey when it comes to meat. Occasionally red meat when I'm with my family or eating food from my country. But I wouldn't give up meat.. Artificial meat will be a godsend. I can't wait to watch those horrible meat companies die from obsolescence.. They'll probably just switch. They're already investing in plant based meat alternatives.

That's different lmao. Why? Dogs and pigs are the same in almost every way. Some scientists think that pigs are actually *more* intelligent than dogs.. So how about we start eating dogs, then?. Or we could just eat neither?. No. I like a good, juicy piece of meat. ;)

Do you mean to say treated well before they were killed?  I only ask because, to me, killing animals doesn't really line up with treating them well. . obviously he means treating them well while they're alive. . Just asking.  The longer I go without meat and animal products, the more I become aware of the huge chasm between people's ideas of what it means to treat an animal well. . you're not just asking you're being obtuse. there is no possible way he could have meant anything other than treated well while alive.

So much pain, suffering and slaughtering of our lesser evolved friends :-(. They are food.  Plain and simple.. Only by choice, it's purely for pleasure in any developed nation.. It's not my choice to eat meat.  I eat meat because it's good and your body needs the protein.. It is your choice.  Theres a million protein sources that dont involve killing something!. That plant has to die for you to eat it.  Show me a food source that isn't alive at some point.. Plants are not sentient.  They have no central nervous system and cannot feel pain.

Good, but the term declares war on automatically makes me want to hate this.. Honestly though, its 10x better than slams.. Couldn't agree more, I hate headlines about (whoever) slamming (whatever). . Slam should never be used in any context outside of wrestling or a Denny's.. Never been to a Denny's, what is slam in this context? It's a restaurant, right?. They have a breakfast meal called the Grand Slam. . And the grand slamwich, lumberjack slam, etc.

Pripyat is still uninhabitable 30 years on.. It's a psychological issue, similar to how plane crashes look disastrous compared to road accidents. Yet the first is much safer than the latter.. I know. Plane disasters only make the news because they are a rarity.  If every car accident was treated like a plane crash, we wouldn't be driving.
t1_dt8qla3	1	*	French President Emmanuel Macron has pledged to shut all of his countrys coal-fired power plants by 2021. We've also decided to make France a model in the fight against climate change, Mr Macron said at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.. Why doesnt he just use that clean coal stuff?. It doesn't exist, coal will never be 'clean'. It doesn't exist currently, but it could be clean, just very expensive and no one wants to put in the money. . What would be the point of working on such technology instead of just investing in renewables?. When they first propose the technology(I heard it like 15 years ago), renewables were very, very expensive and not at all viable to meet world energy demands.. But you would still eventually have to invest in renewables . We always have, how do you think we got here?  It's just that in the earlier days the R&D is more R than D because there product was not as commercially viable as they are now.

Regardless he is the leader if germany decides we need a WW3 and go full blown nazi again the US would be stuck with knocking some sense into them.. At the moment it is in the US, not in Germany, that you see Nazi flags on the streets.. Because germany made it a crime. In the US even the dumbest ideas are still legal

That freedom of speech crap you have over there - it's inconvenient to me, I don't believe in it, and we're working on getting rid of it.  You'd better do the same.. US has better freedom of speech than we do in the UK. They're very similar I'd say. Though hate speech is tolerated less in the UK. . So not really similar at all?. Its not illegal just not socially acceptable. Plus we can talk to coppers like humans and not like kids talk to headmasters.. Bullshit it isn't illegal. If you say things the crown doesn't like you'll definitely get locked up.. Well i havnt ever heard of that happening. We can burn our flags though.

As man is fallible doesn't that also mean the writing are fallible?. Unlike the Bible the Quran is believed to be the direct word of God. Christians believe in a word inspired by God. There is a difference. . The direct word of god, said to an angel, who told Muhammad over the period of 23 years.

Terrorism is most Western countries is historically illegal and socially unacceptable, so terrorism is radical and not conservative in those countries.. Nice playing with words, I guess the perpetrator is a Marxist false flag.. No? Politically motivated violence is far from the status quo, so its radical and anti-conservative..

I think it depends if this attack is political in nature. Obviously it could be considered political, because it's definition is broad. But I mean, it's probably subject to debate.. So you're saying a white guy shooting black people is maybe political?. Yes? Why would it be definitely political or definitely not political?.

He didn't say how, but he said he would solve them.. Hmm, that happened in Germany some time ago as I recall, someone promised to fix all the problems and then created a shit ton more.. Well for a select group of people for a small amount of time, things did get better!. Well, as an outsider looking at the current american policies being pushed, it does appear that for a selected group of people, one could say 1% of them, things are getting much much better recently.. But... they don't *need* it to get better, so in reality it just means things get worse for others. . Which makes them proportionally better off.

You don't turn up 2 indictments without at least one shred of evidence.. Both indictments didnt have anything to do with colluding with Russia to alter the election results. . It takes, like, two seconds of logical thinking to connect the dots between Russian oligarchs buying property for extremely marked up prices to money laundering to blackmail..

The White House did not deny the comment, which has been confirmed by other US media. bbc news right now, I'm just going by what I'm seeing.   . So not denying means you actually did it? Boy, the tables really flip when parties change in the White House. Last people I heard that logic from were people who hate Obama.. multiple Major news organizations straight up lying or having bad sources is the less likely of the two.. Or they realize that they are insulated after the first story breaks. At that point, you aren't reporting on confirmed news, you're reporting on a story. If you aren't first, you're last. . With the president having basically coined the term fake news woulda been an excellent time to demonstrate the point.

No. Youre trying to change the argument.   He said we shouldnt accept refugees from shithole countries.   . And, you're wondering if that's a good idea or not?. Depends on the specific person in question, which is why its wrong to label an entire country of people as undesirable.

Agreed, North Korea should get more nuclear weapons. Its the only thing stopping a 6th American invasion.. in fact the USA should have let Kim Il Sung unify Korea instead of sacrificing so many Americans. And koreans shouldnt have sacrificed themselves helping you massacre the vietnamese. :)  . the bonus is that Vietnamese women would have been spared being raped by Korean soldiers. fuckin hell man, stop spewing your venom all over. Totally immature, inappropriate, and unproductive.

Well, that was kind of why Muslims wanted Pakistan in the first place.  But BJP has gone too far.  I love India, but it's starting to give me the creeps.. *Some* Muslims (mainly landed and industrial elites) wanted Pakistan.  . >mainly landed and industrial elites  TIL.  IME with Muslims in India, they are the least radical, most I guess you could call mainstreamed I have ever met.  Why is that, do you think?. Because they don't share a border with Afghanistan. I can say with confidence that if Pakistan didn't exist, the extremist problems facing Pakistan, India would be facing them.. It's the other way round, if Pakistan didn't exist, there would be no extremist problem in Afghanistan.. The extremist problems didn't exist until after Russia attacked Afghanistan, and the US started giving arms to the 'Mujaheddin', I doubt there would be *no* extremism. maybe less though.. If Pakistan didnt exist, how would US arm the mujahideen? India leaned towards the USSR post 1970. Iran had overthrown the Shah. The only other neighbour was USSR itself

Hindu atheism is a thing.. I'll take your word for it, but I'm sure there are a decent amount of non-hindu atheists in India too. . Without a doubt, was just pointing out that hinduism is more of an umbrella term covering several schools of thought and philosophy including atheism and hedonism etc. (look up charvakas) . Then is it really Hinduism? Isn't it more like Cultural Christians but with Hinduism?. > Cultural Christians but with Hinduism  Truly one of the stupidest things I have read. Why? Surely many Indians are not Hindus but are still influenced by and embrace the culture of a community infused with Hinduism.

Not to say what they say isn't 100% false, but there's a bias to what they say, choose to report and not report. . Wikileaks said they release everything then refused to lease dirt on Russia. This proves Wikileaks is in bed with Russia.   . Politico pretends to be non bias, but they are.  This proves they are in bed with the liberals .

I'm not sure why we even need wikileaks when it's totally possible to anonymously leak information to legitimate news sources, at least in the United States . We don't. The Panama Papers went to WaPo for a reason. Wikileaks has zero credibility and no aspiring whistleblower should offer them anything.. They have never released a fake document. They have 100% credibility.. So what, they have an agenda and are selecting what to leak based on it.  Fuck them, manipulating with truth is worse and scummier than lying.. *Yeah, no western news source would ever do that,* he said explicitly remembering the new York times trying to stop the ~~Pentagon papers~~ CIA fuckups from leaking.   Edit: brain did a stupid. And? If western news sources are doing the same, then my opinion applies to them as well.  I don't understand what you are trying to prove here.. News is news.

t1_ducbfkf	0	*	Gang Boss Who Kidnapped Nurses To Vaccinate The Poor Hailed As Modern-Day Robin Hood. Aren't vaccines free? Even in Brazil?. There was discussion about this yesterday. The vaccines are free, but his gang could not get them because they had arrest warrants and risked arrest at the clinic.. That is really a terrible idea. People should be free to seek medical attention without getting arrested.. Why? It's not like a criminal not going to a doctor directly harms anyone else.. It does when it comes to vaccines because of herd immunization.. That's a fair point. Would it not be feasible to apply some special protections in the case of vaccinations? . I guess. But in general I think a general right to healthcare should include everyone including criminals.

I have known plenty of Chinese (primarily girls in their twenties) who were both educated and in healthy financial situations yet still had their VISA applications denied.. That's probably for reasons different from what you think. There are plenty of Chinese immigrants everywhere around the world, and growing rapidly too. So obviously they don't care if you leave.

t1_dur8qd0	1	*	Japan has approved a new drug that could kill the flu in 24 hours.. Can't wait for that stuff to hit the shelves world wide. This flu season already got me twice. . Did you get a flu shot?. IIRC the flu shot this year wasn't very effective in general.. Yeah, a friend of the family ended up getting the flu twice, as well.. People should get a refund if they paid after proving the product didnt perform as expected. Put pressure on people to create something useful . Flu shots are free dude.. But isn't that only with insurance? I see ads at cvs/Walgreens to come get yours for $X amount (don't remember the exact amount)
t1_dtxp826	0	*	The worlds largest hotel chain is removing plastic straws from all 60 of its properties in Britain  including some of Londons best known five-star destinations  in the latest victory for the Standards Last Straw campaign.. Huh, that's cool.  I remember the Ghibli museum in Japan used straw straws in their cafe. Like straws that are hollow grass reeds.. Very cool. I didn't know these existed?. Well those were the original straws, heck it's where we got the name straws from. It's what people used before plastic became more common and took over.. My dad told me that they used paper/cardboard for straws before plastic came into use. Not sure of accuracy on that. . I can remember using paper straws back in the 70's. I don't know why we still don't use them.. They still sell them, I dont know why we do t use them either.   We used pasta as kids in the 80s. Bucatini was always in our house anyway and made great straws. . I can't find any Bucatini that's big enough for it. Last I got had such a small hole in the center I couldn't even move air through it.
t1_dtp275y	0	*	Israel assassinates more people than any Western country, concludes new book. Why is Israel compared to western countries?  Shouldn't it be compared to neighboring countries like Syria and Egypt and, in the same neighborhood, Iraq and Libya.    . Because israel paints itself as a democracy and better than its neighbors . Yet they're surrounded by dictatorships who all want to wipe them off the face of the earth. Probably because they were created by fiat in a country that already had a local population. . No, because they're Jewish.  We won't stop until we drive the Jew into the sea . Why didn't they do it to the Jews before Israel was a thing? Why only after?. They've hated Jews for a long time, it's nothing new.
t1_ds7oqsm	0	*	Many UK CEOs earn more in three days than a typical worker does in a year. Probably because the work they do makes the shareholders 97% more than the average worker. . I am fairly certain a company needs the batallion of machine greasers exactly as much as the CEO at the top in order to deliver.. It needs the machine greasers more.   Fire all the machine greasers and the company stops dead that day. Fire the CEO and it can run largely undirected for a fiscal quarter or two at the least.. And tomorrow you can have a factory full of brand new machine greasers the very next day. . Only if you assume that onboarding and training costs are zero (which they aren't).. It takes minutes to train a machine greaser, and decades to groom a CEO. . You realize that for the purpose of this discussion we're using machine greaser as a generic placeholder for workers and not specifically just people who grease machines, right?

I don't want to walk around with my pants around my ankles again.
t1_duc17gg	1	*	Russia and China are developing 'destructive' space weapons, US intelligence warns. This could honestly be really scary.  Shoot even if they just shot down US satellites it can still really hurt us.. The US is plenty busy doing their own space military things. Check the Boeing X-37 out . thats a surveillance tool, mostly. There's no reason why it's payload bay can't carry a bunch of anti-satellite missiles. . It is way to small and probably easier just using groundbased systems. . How small is too small when any space launched missile doesn't need to overcome drag from the atmosphere? . enough to have a kinetic or explosive killvehicle. Reactionary control thrusters and an engine that can be used in zero pressure. Im guessing bigger then we think.

They've been pulling this pseudo racist Marxist bullshit for over a decade now and should be isolated from the world because of it . No fuck sanctions, if we do that they're just gonna blame us if their system collapses and it will just make it that much harder for them to reform.   . I agree, no need to do anything. They do this, it'll likely be the end of their agricultural economy.. All I say is that we *don't* send food aid when the inevitable starvation happens.  We can accept refugees from the persecuted class and let the rest of them starve.. So the whites only? . Well they're the ones being persecuted. . I have the sworn word of Hillary Rodham Clinton that whites cannot be persecuted.

Russia was first in space and has the most space firsts out of any other nation and is currently the only country sending humans to space.. My point is they can't be outdone without feeling the need diminish other peoples achievments. . How about you read the fucking article? they COMPLEMENTED Elon Musk on his good marketing trick.. In an attempt to downplay it, as simply a marketing trick. . Jesus the paranoia is huge, the article clearly states that they were impressed by the move and that it was far better then sending a block of concrete.. Something has to be done to boost business. Tesla is not doing very well. Everybody knows that. It was an excellent trick. Just wonderful, Burenkov said.

I remember a few years back the Russians were mocking US saying that well have to send satellites using a trampoline . No satellites. Astronauts. Something the US still doesn't have the technology for.. US has sent people to the moon. They definitely have the technology to send astronauts into space. Maybe they don't have programs that do that at the moment. The moon missions were 50 years ago. Ancient history. They HAD the technology. Nothing of this exists anymore. Nowadays they rent the transport capacity from the Russians. At ridiculously high prices.. What happened to that technology?

Umm higher education in Quebec is a lot lower than in the states, I for one pay about $4000 CAD a year in tuition for university.... Is med school tuition the same amount as undergrad?. I believe so, one of my close friends is in mes school at McGill university and pays the same as me in engineering. In the US, there is really no such thing as a cheap med school. Even at state schools (traditionally cheaper than private schools) they're expensive programs.

It was (and is still, but to a much lesser degree) for health reasons.. America has more HIV and HPV than Europe, so how is that working out?.

Wait, so what is the definition of that word?. There are multiple. Also the article says they were fleeing violence and persecution originally so they are still seeking asylum.. I see there's lots of people downvoting simple facts here.. That level of disinformation is necessary to get moderates to be ok with sending these people home to their deaths.. Yeah, truth is their homes are vats of molten lava. What cruel beasts, trying to throw people back into vats of lava and their doom.

Morocco probably wont accept them.. Morocco isn't asked.

Doesnt asylum have to be approved for asylum rights to apply? I dont think you cant cross illegally, say Asylum!, and expect entitlement to those rights.. I didn't just 'say' asylum, I *declared* it!. I DECLARE **BANKRUPTCY**

I just don't understand how they sleep at night knowing there is 18% left to go  Edit: Wow thanks for the gold random citizen.. well seeing as its world wide 1%, meaning anyone making over $30k, you tell me. That's pretty sad too consider that means 99% of the population makes a astronomically small amount.. stuff is cheeper where they live.. That's because stuff is lower quality where they live.. Uh, have you ever left your home country? Cuz Ive been to plenty where the food was a fraction of the price and of a much higher quality.  You literally have no clue what youre talking about do you?.

t1_dt1xd3t	0	*	Worlds top 1% earn 82% of wealth generated in 2017, says Oxfam. Wealth inequality is a real problem, but it's important to remember that no matter your income, if you spend it all, your wealth will always be zero.. wealth inequality is harmless in and of itself. It's not a zero sum game. Wealth inequality can be however, a symptom of a larger issue, such as a lack of education. . > wealth inequality is harmless in and of itself.  It's not. Ignoring things such as links to violence, it harms the economy by stifling entrepreneurship. . Wealth is not zero sum. Me owning a $250k house does make me 250k wealthier, but does not make you 250k poorer. Same with other assets like stocks etc.... And with real estate? Is there an unlimited amount of land to own? Your owning a house on land certainly means there's less land for other people to put up houses. . And be buying Boeing stock means you can't buy those shares. Doesn't make you poorer. And yet increased concentration of wealth has corresponded with decreased public ownership of stocks..

That's because we give Jordan a billion dollars a year out of our budget to keep Israel safe, and doing shit like this of. . If you want, I'll give you the $0.0001 you paid in taxes for that.  Also, good relations between Israel and Jordan go back to 1948. But I wouldn't expect someone like you to actually know history.. >good relations  >Multiple wars. Wars they did not want to fight. Like I said, if you actually knew history, you'd know this. Instead you have a black and white analysis of politics and history.. Apparently they didn't mind fighting them all that much. If politics and history aren't black and white then terrorism isn't really wrong btw.

Not really, USD is an international standard. Most international money things are measured in it.. I'm pretty sure he knows that. Doesn't change the fact that the headline can certainly be read the way he said. . It could be but I doubt it would be.. Scroll up.  Long comments threads complaining that this is the fault of the US/capitalism without any acknowledgement that this is between two countries that claim to operate under Communism. Well then if that's the case I have really overestimated some people's intelligence and I apologise.. You've overestimated your own intelligence by not being able to understand how the title may be misinterpreted.

I don't need people to tell me how to practise my religion. H. Regardless of your distaste of FGM as a Muslim, FGM is common/standard in many Muslim countries.. Not really, most countries use FGM for cultural reasons, like in Africa, not so much for religion. . Not true. It's common in non-african countries and blaming it on cultural reasons is an obfuscation because it's phenomenon is closely attached to populations dear to Islam.. List the countries and then how many Muslim countries there are. Because most implies more than half bud.   And common isn't exactly 2% of the population. .

t1_dugq5g0	1	*	Iceland law to outlaw male circumcision sparks row over religious freedom. That picture.... Jesus that kids like 7 who the fuck circumcises a kid that old?. I had a friend the was from Kenya. For them getting circumcised was a part of becoming an adult. he was between 11 and 13. he hated life for a week+. Still not as bad as being circumcised at seven. . I'd rather be circumcised at 7 than 11-13. At 7 you don't have to worry too much about accidental erections.. Fair point, but at 11-13, someone is closer to being old enough to make life-changing decisions for themselves. . Closer but still very very far away.  Just think about the amount your mental state changed from the time you were 13 until 18.

I was skeptical he would be re-elected initially, but as his presidency progresses I am finding it increasingly more likely. A lot of Republicans are very happy with what he is doing.. A lot of independents as well, how well the economy is doing is historically the number one indicator of an incumbent president getting reelected or not. Trump could legitimately hit 4-5% GDP growth.

Why hasn't he implemented the sanctions he signed in August last year?. I just said because he's not the one directly implementing.

Yeah the argument that the GOP made was that their corporate rate wasn't competitive with the rest of the world.  The rate is already lower in Canada.. Yep, im glad the US rate is much lower now. Prior, we were seeing stupid inversions like Burger King buying Tim Hortons, then moving their HQ to Canada to avoid US taxes. Enough.. They're still going to do that though, unless you can lower it below the lowest rate on the planet.. The legal, aquisition and transition costs will make it not appealing in many cases where it was previously appealing. That's honestly not true, dig a little deeper.. Maybe you should dig up a finance text book and learn how companies decide what projects to pursue... this is honestly true. In fact it's not just honestly true. It's eminently true.

Russia was the heart of the USSR, but modern Russia is not the USSR.

Without ISDS, how do they resolve disputes?. Investor state dispute settlement is really only needed if you can't trust the governments' courts to fairly handle a claim against that government.  . Do you trust Vietnams courts to rule against their home corporations?   I wouldnt trust any county other than the US, Canada, and Australia to have courts which are independent enough to be fair. . You would Not trust a court from Norway, Sweden, Finnland, Germany, france or GB?

European free speech law is different from America's.. The difference is the lack of free speech. . Article 7 of my constitution doesn't exist anymore? Since when?. You can call it what you want but you dont have free speech in France, sorry. You have Hate speech laws dude. . If the majority of the western world has free speech and hate speech laws, why shouldn't the Americans call it something else? We outnumber you.. Because we did it first, all you did was (poorly) copy us.  When we were enshrining Freedom of Speech in our code of laws you were still peasants on land owned by your royal families.
t1_dv30kb0	1	*	Marine Le Pen: French far-right leader charged over Isis tweets. Is Marine Le Pen even far-right? She just sounds right-wing to me.. her father was using a hitler's youth knife to torture civilians in algeria. does that hint enough?. It says you judge someone by their family members.. She took over the far-right party of her nazi father, does that hint enough now?. Not really, you still haven't said anything about her directly.. > She took. So she reformed a far right party into a right-wing party?  Kudos to Marine Le Pen.
t1_dtuzskq	1	*	Elon Musk's Falcon rocket launches successfully. I am here for the Core. . Do they have a recovery team nearby to recover it if it missed?. They'll recover it for forensic purposes to see what failed and what could fail, but it's unflyable after soaking in salt water.. And if it hit at 300mph, it's unflyable from disintegrating.. Yeah but mostly just the salt water. The salt water definitely makes gluing all the little pieces back together more difficult.    But after today I believe they can pull off just about anything =). Yea, but mostly salt water...

Elon literally sent a fucking car into space for no other reason than PR and memes. . They tested the rocket. The payload had to be something.

It went for a swim. :(  https://twitter.com/jeff_foust/status/961028116662669312. I would still love to see video of that.. Same, but SpaceX is often stingy on videos like that. Took over a year before they released their first landing attempts video. Musk likes to hoard all the juicy shots for himself.. Elon said in the presser they'd release it as a blooper if the camera survived. Apparently the fireball was pretty impressive.

Musk just sent space junk to Mars!!!!Mean while MREs to Puerto Rico something something...... it's a space company not a charity. No better way to show it than to put your car in orbit around a planet.I mean what a great scientific advancement every planet should have its own car in orbit .The word im thinking of is hubris.. it needed a payload, better a car than some concrete blocks. Yeah that's justification. Sand bags would have worked just fine but they wouldst say Tesla like a car would.{look at all my money I want to play}. you're pretty negative about this. image what people would say when spacex launched a bunch of sand or concrete into space.. Why didn't they just send a billboard that unfolded and astronomers could spend the next millennia looking at it,and sing the praises of Musk.

So you're saying brown things are the problem?. The Browns are definitely a problem if you live in Cleveland. . But not a problem anywhere else.

t1_dsx989p	0	*	Trudeau bans anti-abortion groups from summer jobs funding. Any organization which does not respect Canada's rights charter is not eligible for funding. No problem for me.. Abortion isnt in the charter. It was ruled in '84 that it actually is in The Charter. . No it used the charter, it is not explicitly said, nor do we have any regulation, which we should get honestly. It was ruled that explicit inclusion in The Charter was unnecesary due to it being implicit in section 7.. Which is honestly ridiculous. Most abortions have nothing to do with security of the person and restrict the life and liberty of the infant . There is no infant. An aborted fetus is not a person and therefor has no liberties.

Even as a comedy, they'll have to tone it down so that people who didn't live through it don't accuse the writers of lazy writing. . future karma posts will be 'TIL the biographical film of the Trump presidency actually toned down alot of things cause the real life incidents were too unbelievable to test audiences'. hell you could make that movie, fully release it right now and people still wouldn't believe it.   its just insanity. Fake movie . Alternative Films.  That's 100% what they should call it.

Not for him to fire Mueller; the Deputy AG has to fire him because the AG recused himself. Correct. He can have Mueller fired. . So you would be okay with Hillary firing Mueller if she was under investigation? Yeah that's what I thought. If the team was as blatantly bias as this one is, yes.  This same team (pretty much) investigated her Last year and they exonerated her before they even investigated her. . So you want a team full of trump supporters to investigate Trump? Again your bias is clearly showing. Not what I said at all.  I want an UNBIASED investigative team. Not sure why this is hard to understand.

I don't blame him, the whole thing is a soft coup anyway and 'Russian' 'collusion' is bullshit.  (eagerly awaiting downvotes and autism). You should tell Trumps son in law that because he already admitted to collusion.. OH NOES HE COMMITTED A COLLUSIONS.  ... you don't even know what that means, because if you did you'd know it wasn't illegal and that you need to stop watching so much CNN.. I know it's not illegal, asshole. Covering up a conspiracy and obstruction of justice is illegal.. Does tinfoil cause balding?. I understand this isn't covered by Fox News or Breitbart but, Mueller is building a obstruction of justice case.. I hope he brings back Elvis too.
t1_dt9e1un	1	*	Trump Ordered Mueller Fired, but Backed Off When White House Counsel Threatened to Quit. If and when filmmakers make a historical movie about the current presidency, no matter how serious the situation, it would probably always fall under comedy genre. . That is the thing. Fiction needs to be believable. Truth has no such burden.   EDIT: Apparently this is a pharaphrasing of a Mark Twain line. Now I know.. Well done. You may have just coined a phrase. Edit: Sorry, Mark Twain. . I believe he's cashing in someone else's coin.. the report of my originality was an exaggeration. The secret to creativity is never revealing your sources. C. E. M. Joad [(allegedly)](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2014/06/01/creative/). Well I'd say part of it would also be that your sources never reveal you.

Not doubting you but whats your source for that?. Not gonna provide on. It can be googled and I just left a comment lol.. So youre bullshitting? . Literally just google it. Not hard.

t1_dunqmva	0	*	Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny detained in Moscow | World news. People should stop calling him opposition leader ... he polls at less than 10%.. Because people who grew up under Soviet rule are going to randomly tell people who they like in the election. . Umm...why wouldnt they? If anything people who grew under soviets have a much deeper appreciation of democracy then most americans nowadays do. . Maybe because they might recall that dissidents get sent to Gulags or executed. Or have you never had a history class?. Did you? When did the last people gtet sent to gulags...or executed for political dissent? HAve you read history or just the aberant propaganda that seems to go around in USA schools ?. > or executed for political dissent  [like in 2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Boris_Nemtsov)?

You can't claim to be a non-combatant.  Really? So Israeli scientists are open for hunting then?. Iran can definitely try to kill them, but just like the Mossad does it, they must do it covertly. In either case, if the attack succeeds, it's technically illegal.  So in conclusion, yes, they are.. lol, your reasoning is: as long as you don't get caught you can break any rule or law there is.

Decreasing immigration was a large reason people voted for brexit, absolutely. . Shame we could have done that while in the EU and Theresa May failed to do anything about it while Home Secretary.

Still WAY better than most religions.. atheism or even agnosticism arent religions so dont speak about them as such. Atheism has to be a religion.  Calling atheism a religion triggers people worse than most Catholics would ever flip out.. Atheism is a religion like feminism is a religion.  Just being real. . Correct, like [this](https://youtu.be/wPZT7CASvCs?t=232).  Feminism, atheism, and other left wing ideologies taken to the extreme end up becoming cults like Jonestown and the Khmer Rouge.

Ask any leftist if women should be forced to wear the hijab, even by their families, and the vast majority will say no. You are being fed false beliefs by your echo chamber.. Echo chamber?

Being obese your whole life is pretty shitty too.. being hungry your whole life is worse... i think.. That's because you are too fat and have to keep eating to support your fat body. cut some weight and you won't feel that hungry anymore. Not quite true. When you lose weight, your body continues to act like your set weight is higher than your new healthier weight. 90% of diets fail because of the human drive of hunger. . Pretty sure 90% of diet fail because people's poor choice of food and lack of displine.  . Ok, so they didn't successfully ignore million years of evolution to eat more. What a bunch of undisciplined losers. I bet they reflexively take a breath if they're underwater too long as well. 
t1_dtbwi46	1	*	Tens of thousands of cancer cases could be prevented with weight loss, study says. But then fatsos would have to actually exercise. No, they just need to lose weight by eating less. Exercise alone doesn't really help you lose weight since you'll naturally eat more to make up for the burned calories.. Yet I dont see any fatties out there when I am running or playing volleyball  Interesting how that works. Exercise is far more difficult when overweight, yet I see some on the bike path.. Thats cause the bike does the work. Are you saying that he only sees people riding electric bikes?. Nope, didnt say that  But those are for super lazy people

That doesn't mean that EVERY year is drier.  If this next season is unusually wet then it could buy them enough to time get some other measures in place.. It's not only SA.

I also suspect no other world leader would think that he has either the right or the influence to do so.  Let's hope he doesn't start a war with the wrong country.. So sanctions are meaningless in your world then, since no one should be able to enforce them..

They came with the pipe cleaner, and the straws are rainbow-colored. The plain metal ones look too much like actual pipes for my taste.. How do they taste? I've always thought ceramic or glass would be a much better straw material. . I would guess that glass would have issues when dropped or with hot water when washing (cracks easy).

I think you just need to suck it up and deal with a mild aftertaste in the aim of improving our environment.. Why should I deal with that when I can just not use a straw?. Erm, is anyone actually arguing that? Who is forcing you to use paper straws against your will? Of course just not using a straw is way better than using a paper one.. You were talking about having to suck it up to improve the environment. I think no compromises are needed.. Not even for a pun?

It was a shop which exploded, most likely a gas explosion before anyone jumps to conclusions about it being a terrorist attack.  https://twitter.com/CaptShepster/status/967852414480117763. What kind shop?. An off-licence. Basically a liquor store for those who don't know but they sell shit like bread, milk etc as well. . So, gas + liqueur = boom? That what happened?. It's not clear at this time but it looks like a gas explosion. The alcohol would've had little to no impact on the size of the blast. . Alcohol usually has an impact on if I have a blast or not . That's realy sad that you require alcohol to have fun

Not as much as America, but we have it.  Source:  I work in ED.. Sure, we have it, but it's not common is it? never seen people doing that but seen plenty of people doing most other drugs. It depends where you are;  drugs are very regional. I saw plenty in Manchester and its satellite towns.. I am in manchester lol. Then we move in different circles.  I know spice isnt pretty dominant, but I saw a fair bit of meth.

Seeing as how Mao was just as, if not more, brutal than Stalin, and used similar tactics, it is accurate to describe Mao as a Stalinist. Hence, Maoists are basically Stalinists with an Asian slant.

If the rest of Britain was willing to provide free education for Scottish students like the EU does then I'm sure Holyrood would be willing to extend the same to them. . The rest of Britain pays taxes for Scottish students to get free tuition, so it should be free for the rest of the students in Britain.. No they don't.. Thanks, it's helpful you simply writing you disagree with a fact. Thanks for the contribution, hope it makes you feel great.. Does the rUK send the UK a cheque specifically marked as For tuition fees?. When I pay tax am I sending a cheque specifically marked for the NHS?

t1_dt7eh16	1	*	North Korea calls for reunification with South Korea. wat.  ^^^Edit: ^^^wtf. Both sides have always wanted reunification. He isn't saying he wants North Korea to join South Korea to make Korea.. He wants the South to join the North to make Korea.. China would never allow the North to unite under the South because that would put a US ally with a missile defense (attack capable) system right on their border. . Exactly, On the flip South Koreans won't unite under NK because.. Duh.  Best hope for NK is a non-dynasty leadership.. South Korea has no real interest in reunification. North's GDP is a tiny fraction of what SK is, so if Korea was to reunite, a economic catastrophy would ensue.. How would it differ from the reunification of East and West Germany in 1989 (or so)?. It's much more severe and worst in NK then East Germany. Also the effects of the different Germany's are still felt today

Are you sure about that being the EU case? Internal immigration aside.  Not that it matters though, the shithole immigration is what bothers people. No one cares for the rest.. i believe the british hate polish immigrants so much they vote yea for brexit. that's internal immigration, no? but maybe poland is eu's shithole?.

It's like there are market forces here where female models are more highly desired than male models and as a result, creates a gap based on demand. . Exactly.

Source? I thought men and women tennis players make the same.. Some tournaments have equal prize-money, but they are the minority. Generally the men's prizes are worth much more, just go and look at the prizemoney from any of the grandslams to compare. . Sir/Maam, that is still not a source. I was under the impression that all major tournaments had equal prize money for men and women.. They certainly match at Wimbledon.

The irony is you actually don't know what you're talking about, and this is all just complete conjecture based on literally nothing.. not really, because most Chinese are not fluent in English... while Expats certainly are.

Sadly, any republican would NEVER believe this but what you said is so dead on accurate that its scary... and of course we havent seen as many tweets bragging about the stock market now.. Republicans dont like this and theyre trying to talk him out of it. Most people dont think that its good to have tariffs. . But he's stickin' it to them chineses! We need a president who puts America first!         /s. That is literally what they're saying in /r/the_donald.  . Man that's sad https://np.reddit.com/r/the_donald/comments/81df09. There are actually some posts there taking the side of tariffs are bad.  This seems to be a bit of a dividing line amongst trump supporters.

Yeah, me and the other millions who voted him in. Opps.. Deplorables* who voted for someone with a Russian hand around his balls . Lol, i would not even care of that was the case.

He totally didn't want to win anyway and he lost a type of vote that didn't even matter so ha!. Also, the sky is blue and the earth is round. Any other mundane statements you want to make?.

I think that's unnecessary.  You don't have to tell a bull what to do in a China shop, you just have to get him in there and he does what comes naturally.. Best metaphor.

Apparently it still isnt good enough people are still dying we need to start cracking down on this. . Planes are ok when they do what they're designed to do. Terrible when they don't. . So your telling me if an object is used for what its sole purpose is makes it okay? But once it fails or someone miss use the object we shouldnt try to ban them are put stricter bans on them?. Really depends on what the objects sole purpose is doesn't it?. So would the objects purpose be considered what the manufacturer designed it to do are the person who is using it?

Is this perhaps because health care is increasingly being treated as a business?. I'm sure medical malpractice plays a huge part in this as well. It's probably less risky to do a c section.. I'm not sure that's true, c sections are still major abdominal surgery and risk all the complications that go along with that.. A better way to put it it is that a c-section is more controlled. The risks are present but known and limited in scope.. And you can charge more! . And it leads to complications that require 6 days in the NICU for observations and are billed at $120K.  Shit's a racket.. And you get charged for holding your baby after.

Never knew these benches were meant for the homeless.  . They're meant for everyone :). They're meant for people to sit on. It's not for one person to take up the whole bench and deny access to others. . Damn, you can't sit on a bench ? That's horrible !   This dude who has nowhere to sleep when it rains sure should be a little more considerate.. Dude who sleeps,  shits on benches who others then have to clean and sit on.   Yeah let's be considerate towards such individuals. . Listen to yourself. Youre saying that all homeless people are shitting on benches. . Doesn't matter if its all,  half, quarter or 5%.  Shitting,  dumping trash, drug paraphernalia,  etc.  Who's going to clean it up?  You?  Of course not.

t1_dst5pgl	1	*	Bitcoin crashes as Chinese Central Bank calls for ban on cryptocurrency trading.. Good. Bitcoin uses massive amounts of electricity to mine and produces nothing of tangible value.. Like the entertainment industry ? Or sport ? Or music ?. People derive enjoyment from entertainment, sports and music. That's the value they create. Bitcoin is just electronic money. . So bitcoin has no derivative value to anyone ? You do realise that statement makes no sense whatsoever . People pay money to consume entertainment, which is how the entertainment industry creates value. Bitcoin isn't at all comparable.. > People pay money to mine or purchase bitcoin, which is how the bitcoin industry creates value  Say what?. They pay money in order to invest it Bitcoin, not to consume it for entertainment. I'm not sure what's so confusing about that.

This is a really stupid selfish reason, but I hope that cryptocurrency crashes into the ground because I would really love to be able to buy a video card at a reasonable price sometime soon.. That and quit wasting energy.  I've heard miners use more electricity than Denmark.  . So do people who put up Christmas decorations but nobody is going on a crusade against them for that, even though it's literally useless. . We don't base any currency on Christmas lights.. So its an even worse use of electricity.. Well no, because lighting is actually useful.. so the planes know where not to fall, obviously

Don't generalize an entire group of people. Seems harsh and ignorant. I'm going by the title posted by OP, so my response is proper.. So you admit you didn't read the article? Cause it's an Israeli film festival. Funded by Israel. Ambassador just isn't attending. You sad pathetic motherfucker. . Here we go. You forgot to call me anti-semitic and other colorful things.. You didn't read the article. Therefore your response is antisemitic. Hope you get hit by a palestinian rocket.. Hopefully, it will be shot by you, but as a coward, will blame it on the Palestinians.

I mean... They have? And still do? And will continue to do so?  But its ok, because those kids had sticks and stones and we need those illegal settlements built!. Are you as dumb as you look.

Yeah those armored and armed Israeli soldiers should be shivering in their boots at the thought of rocks.. They throw rocks at Israeli civilians.. Source? Also even if, thats not worthy of death.. I guess terrorism doesn't warrant a military response, only in the State of Israel.  Really, fuck off with double standards.

One day they'll drag us into their conflict more than we already are.. I was thinking more like everyone has fault in this conflict and i wouldnt judge the US for supporting a country thats conpletly surrounded by other hostile countries. I'd rather stay out of it and let them blow each other off the face of the Earth. . Thats one way to see it but id rather not have multiple countries kill each other. Me neither, but you know violence is the only thing on some peoples' minds, especially in the uncivilized countries.

Doesn't stop the majority of them from being a bunch of cunts most of the time though.. I, too, love generalizing a massive population as cunts. . Haha. It's called racism.. In this case its anti-semitism, but i wouldnt be surprised if that person decides to pop in and correct me that its anti-imperialism. I'm not anti-semitic, I'm just anti-zionist, which means I hate Israelis, but only the Jewish ones!

Might try making your own like us old veggie hippies from the 60s, 70s and 80s. Admit I am too lazy and thats why we buy it. But plenty of recipes out there and its easy to make. . Even if you make your own, don't you still need to use chick peas??. Itxb4s always much cheaper to make something yourself than to buy it already done, provided you have the tools for it.. Of course, but if the key ingredient becomes outrageously expensive, even making it yourself will be useless. I look to what happened with vanilla recently, as an example of this. . You're not going to save a load making your own hummus anyway. You don't have the same economies of scale that producers have so you're not going to save much once you've bought everything.. I don't think this is true for hummus. I make my own and buy from the store when I'm feeling lazy. It is significantly cheaper to make my own.

But isnt the speed significantly reduced? I normally reach ~10 to 15 mb per Second (i believe) and like being able to download stuff fast.. depends on the VPN to be honest. I have 300 mbps down through my ISP and when connected through my VPN I'm usually 200+ mbps so I'm still happy.. Any recommendations?  I did a bunch of research and picked one, but its slow as fuck.  . Hidemyass is good and fast if you find a location really close to you. Chances are you will if you're not in Africa or the likes. It costs money though.

It only routes through 5 countries, bandwidth is unlimited. It is only browser based too. It's not the most featured VPN but definitely works for my needs and its free.

It should be the blood of Saint Isidore of Seville, though some people claim Saint Nicholas of Myra works better.. Don't tell Norman Reedus, but I got a tiny vial of his blood and scribed a sigil & circle around my network core. I figure he played a saint, so it's close enough. Also it's probably zombie-proof.

I have never heard anyone using mega. You're the first.. Honestly, that says more about you than about Mega. I mean ... just check its Alexa rank. It also has over 100 million registered users.

It might also be that good old lithium in the water supply:  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3863886/. Seems like an extremely weak study that doesnt prove much of anything tho... There are five other similar studies. Whether or not the studies are weak or strong isn't the right question. It's wether these studies are ethical.. Could you perhaps explain why you think these studies may not be ethical? And why such question is more important than the results in this case? I can't really tell why you think that is the case.. >Could you perhaps explain why you think these studies may not be ethical?   Ummm...I don't know, how about the consent of the people who will be consuming the water. Do I really have to explain this?. Are you one of those people who's concerned about the fluoridation of water and its effects on our precious bodily fluids?. No. What does fluoride have to do with Lithium?

This is why your country is such a shit show, pal.. nah its more like no one group can claim moral superiority based on history since possibly the only true altruistic thing that has ever been done was the abolishment of slavery.. TIL saying person is bad = claiming 'moral superiority'.

Maybe he could learn from the guy who deserves huge credit for the recent South and North Korea negotiations?. He has no ability to negotiate that, it's all pre-agreed by the Department for Transport and tied up in contracts. The Mayor has no control over that lot.. You're totally right.

Can we just start forcing people to get hypocrite tattooed on their foreheads for stuff like this?   Just, as a warning to others.. Or maybe make hypocrisy in politics a sackable offence. . can you think of a potential downside to that?. 80% of current members thrown out of office. Nope, not seeing a downside so far.. Who do you think gets to determine what is hypocrisy?. The electorate?. They're not really doing what I'd call a bang-up job at the moment.

UK needs to up their PR game. If this release was from France this would be pitched as the result of a long government environmental campaign (given Macron's press releases lately anyway).. For all the partisan bullshit you read online the government is doing a good job on renewables and reducing fossil fuel usage . They are replacing coal by gas.. Which is vastly superior.. Still a fossil fuel. Still emitting CO2.. Yes yes but look at the advantages:  * Higher Energy Density * Lower Cost * Lower CO2 Emission  Its much easier to get clean NG then it coal. Once coal is gone, we can work on killing NG.. It's 2018. I wouldn't boast about replacing coal by gas, that's all.  It's just show how backward the UK's energy production is.

Or you let it detonate in Hudson River right inside NYC, killing hundreds of thousands and make the homes of million others inhabitable for decades with radioactive clouds of soil. . Dude a 100mt in Hudson river would kill way more than 100,000's. In could very well be in excess of 10,000,000. In fact it almost certainly would be.. How would it be in excess of 10M when the population of NYC is 8.5M...?. Blast will open a hole in space-time, killing millions in the past as well.. well, if they're gonna try that, ignore New York, you'd have better odds detonating it in Cardiff
t1_dsp46t3	1	*	Russia is in possession of an underwater nuclear drone capable of carrying a 100-megaton nuclear warhead, a recently leaked draft of the Pentagon's Nuclear Posture Review confirmed.. Watch this just be used as justification for the USA to build a bigger one . We have absolutely no use for something like this.. Neither does Russia but you don't see that stopping them. . Honestly, these are great anti-carrier-group weapons. Park this in the path of a group, wait as long as possible, then rush in and detonate underneath the fleet.. You mean a nuclear sea mine which has existed for many decades and costs 1-50th as much?. but this has the word drone in it so you know it's really scary . Just wait for the blockchain drone

And let's throw in an alert system that can be triggered by one dude clicking a mouse on the wrong dropdown menu.. Thank god the nuclear alert went off while the president was golfing.  *Holy shit that is a depressing sentence to write*.. Is it sad that I know what would have happened if he was at his desk?. He would have freaked out because it's the weekend and he wasn't golfing at his own resorts on the taxpayer's dime. saturday is for the bois not for boring office work. The other week I saw a truck flying a flag that said Saturday is for the boys out of **the fucking bed.** You cannot know the combination of cringe and contempt I felt in that moment.

t1_dsa8pfp	0	*	Social network profile to become official ID in China. Fuck that, no way. Nope. Never.. It's already so close to this in America. The social networking sites all know all your info, your location, and your habits. Having your state ID tied to it wouldn't make a difference here.. Social media sites knowing your info is not the same as the government identifying you primarily by your social media profile.. You are assuming the government doesn't keep your social media info in the file with the rest of your information? . Again, that's not how they identify you.

Yeah there's no reason to have issues with Islam, only the prejudiced would be critical of it. /s . It's okay to hate the Islamic religion.  It's not okay to hate the Islamic *people*.. it's okay to hate the nazi ideology   it's not okay to hate nazis.

This doesn't come anywhere close to offsetting the negative consequences of his actions. list the negative consequences of his actions, please.  Something tangible, not just feelings.. His push for more coal is a good start. Although it did backfire on him lol The man he put in charge of the EPA is useless, there's that too.. We need the EPA to save the planet?  The EPA has always been useless.. If the EPA has always been useless, then Trump appointing someone terrible for the job is a huge mistake. He should try to fix our institutions, not mail it in because it's always been useless.. Or maybe he just appointed a money man to lead and audit the Agency because he felt they spent an exorbitant amount of money in the prior administration. To streamline the EPA per say.

I think its the reverse in America: The poorer you are the greater the punishment.. What? You can't pay the fine? Here's some non-payment fees. Still can't pay? We'll just give you some jail time. What? you just lost your job because you were in jail? We still want our money.. seriously asking, how do they get their money if you cant pay and went to jail? does the government pay for you?. The government sometimes pays tens of thousands to collect a few hundred (or less). It makes no sense, unless the point is to terrorize poor people rather than run a functional society.. Ah yes.

Surprisingly, Europeans are fine with Germany not having an overwhelmingly strong military.. It needs to be stronger. We should not depend on the US. We also shouldn't repeat the american mistake of burning a third of our budget on the military.. The US military is what is defending Germany. from who?. From any military threat.

Dont threaten German engineers with a good time. . They are all busy building an airport and a train station.... lol yeah the Berlin airport is definitely the most ungerman thing yet.. Most likely because it is being built in Berlin... which is like a giant pile of problems itself. It's built in Brandenburg, shut up. And I personally blame Dobrindt, he was minister of infrastructure and the airport belongs to Berlin, Brandenburg and the state.

Funny how when you have a society that is positive about the role of government and strict laws on campaign funding that you end up with better results than in the US. . Couldn't agree more. America's largest flaw is it's us vs. them attitude when it comes to government. It is the single most contributing factor in our decline as a Nation. . Yep, political parties are football teams. I love my team above all else and fuck anyone who gets in the way of us winning...... If only someone, say our very first President, had warned us of this very thing.. They tried to make that guy a king. Americans talk a lot of shit about freedom and liberty, but they're terrified of any freedom that doesn't arm them.

Wasn't it confirmed just roughly half a year ago that Trump's tweets are offical presidential statements?. the federal government views them as official statements, they're being written in text in his name, twitter is simply the channel by which he releases those statements. Wow just think about how absurd that is.. Oh it absolutely is, but welcome to 2018. We have a president who, instead of getting up in front of the press, just screams into the void of the internet . why should be speak to a press that is absolutely biased against him only to have those words go through their filter when he can bypass them completely and speak to everyone with internet access? . Because those press conferences are typically televised, you can quite easily watch them yourself. Or he can just tweet it and skip the middle man. Twitter isn't the problem, its the ridiculous shit that he says on it.

Except the ones who benefit from the system the way it is don't want it to change. Hard to affect change when it's counter productive to the asshats who benefit from it. .

Failed to make a required disclosure based on their knowledge or suspicion that Kaloti and/or some of its suppliers were engaged in money laundering.. If someone wants to move 5 tons of whatever, why do we not let him?. Import export laws? Intrastate commerce? There are many reasons. Or you know, to prevent money laundering in the form of bullion. . I don't understand money launderers who aren't using crypto currency in this day and age. Plus we get to make a profit from international money laundering for a change.. How the fuck do you buy crypto with cash? . Local Bitcoins! DUHHHHHH. Just meet up with some rando in an alley and trade your millions of dollars of cash for Bitcoin. Money launderers are hella dumb this is hella easy.. actually there are plenty of ways to buy crypto with cash 
t1_dt2gof5	1	*	Whistleblower claims accountants turned a blind eye to Dubai firm he says painted 5 tons of gold to look like silver. Not very smart.

And you would be correct.. I knew it was a joke, I just didnt get it right away..

t1_duwmk77	0	*	Russian Students Threatened With 'Repressions' After Mentioning Navalny. So? Pretty much the same in the west if you mention Trump or Jordan Peterson.. >  Jordan Peterson.  Nobody even knows who that is.. Same as with Navalny.. Are you talking about the Navalny with more than 2million twitter followers? Or a different one that nobody knows about?. You are funny. You know almost all his followers are fake, right?. Ive looked at your post history and it really looks like the way a Russian would write in English.  Does the chef feed you now?. Wait now. Are you arguing that his twitter followers are not fake or do you acknowledge they are fake and now you are just moving on to personal attacks?
t1_dtvjuz9	0	*	Iran executed 3 children in January. 1st kid, not problem, sicko who prob wasn't going to be reformed..other 2, gray areas not enough detail, but didn't warrant execution either . Totally agree. I don't know how anyone could defend these scum, especially the first one.. The girl who was married at 13 to some old pervert fuck. He probably raped her many times over the 4 years. She is scum?. Don't know the details, and barbaric as their culture might be, what do you expect, to just let her loose after murdering someone?. > what do you expect, to just let her loose after murdering someone?  Well, yes, it was self defense.. By your reasoning, many, maybe most Iranian men deserve to be exterminated.. No, only by your warped misunderstanding on what is self-defense.
t1_dubz4x2	0	*	Japan, the United States and the European Union are considering jointly filing a case against China at the World Trade Organization over Chinese rules that effectively force foreign companies to transfer technologies to domestic firms, The Yomiuri Shimbun has learned.. I'm all for free market and China selling their shit everywhere.  China totally needs to cut this shit out if they want free trade. This is total bullcrap.. Yep, if China wants unrestricted access to western markets they should also let western companies have unrestricted access to their own.. China doesn't have unrestricted access to Western markets.. Then they should also file cases with the WTO against western markets that they believe they should be allowed to have greater access to.. That takes too long. Might take years. Bullshit.. Well is the west can go through this long process to be treated fairly then so can China.. But China doesn't require the West to go through that process, so why would China have to?
t1_dubzjn1	1	*	Japan, the United States and the European Union are considering jointly filing a case against China at the World Trade Organization over Chinese rules that effectively force foreign companies to transfer technologies to domestic firms, The Yomiuri Shimbun has learned.. This strikes me as reasonable . China doesn't try and force its rules on us... let's force our rules on China.     Why does that strike you as reasonable?. > China doesn't try and force its rules on us  ummmm. China forcing their rules on companies is why this WTO complain is being brought. . China is enforcing its own rules within its borders. It doesn't, for example, force the US to adopt the same rules within American borders.. > China is enforcing its own rules within its borders  That doesn't mean they can break international law. . It doesn't.  Is the US breaking international law by enforcing its own rules within its own borders?. That is not what they are arguing though...You seem to have very little clue as to what the WTO does or how this is going to impact China if they lose and refuse to change.

Well... the US breaks international laws in OTHER countries. So I think this infraction by China is relatively slight. As another person on this thread said, can't have your cake and eat it too. . Well as the saying goes. Two wrongs make a right. /s
