t1_dun5gg7	1	*	More than two thirds of all countries corrupt, Transparency International (TI) report says. TI found that majority of countries in the world can be called corrupt, with a clear link between high levels of corruption and little protection of the media and civil society groups.. Not this again.  That yearly report only measures the *perception* of corruption in the respective countries. Not the actual level of corruption.. So basically the way to score higher is to make better propaganda?. Well Russian propaganda and messaging campaigns are really on point but that didn't help them much on this list. Anti-Russian propaganda campaigns are on point considering that you believe Russian propaganda is on point.... >  that would be the case, then why China for example is still ranked extremely low. Their current leader has picked of ~~hundreds of thousands of corrupt officials.~~ competitors.  . What does that mean?

That's the beauty of math, you can always bend it. Get yourself a fractional base and you can divide it all you want.  edit: i am an idiot.. The definition of a prime number is that you *can't* divide it in integer bases. If a prime number could be divided by integer bases then *it wouldn't be prime.*. Yeah ... I can just pick 1/2 and voila. There are suddenly no primes anymore because they're all divisible, such insight.. Sure thing, but why talk about tomatos when we are talking about bees?.

I don't think the people who proposed making autism a broad spectrum could have imagined the harm and resurgence of preventable diseases that would result. Weird result of doing that.. It's not exactly a result of changing the definition to a spectrum. It is, however, a result of stupid people ignoring science and doing whatever they want without regard for consequences.. That's why denying science is an impediment to any progress mankind could make.. The real impediment is people who are not intelligent enough to understand science being alive.

First the US gets rid of the Army (which causes ISIS) then the US isn't going to help rebuild which is going to further destabilize the country. . Invading Iraq is what started the mess, and then not intervening in Syria is what made it worst.  Deciding which shots to take, and not to take, is critical to winning.. Invading wouldn't have been that bad if the US continued the payments to the army. Millions of soldiers were out of work after being promised monthly payments from the US.. What would the point have been?. The point of what? Paying them? They didn't have any work so they joined terrorist groups that would pay them.. No, the point of the war even if had done so...  and then what?

It's extremely hard to not take the eye for an eye approach. We in the US haven't taken this approach since basically our inception..

Many in Mexico believe that legalization hasn't been possible because the US is opposed to it.. Is that to say that federal legalization in the US could make it possible in Mexico?. No but US policy greatly affects decisions on other countries. . They are also right on our border, so from the DEA's perspective it opens up a huge area of land where drugs can flow even more freely than they do now. . Yeah, what happens when Canada legalizes in a few months? We share the largest unprotected border with America.

How can I know what's false about it, when the biggest people against it are also some of it's biggest unrepentant causes, if it's real?. Just listen to the scientists if you want to know if it is real. I don't know what you mean by, the biggest people against it are its biggest causes. You mean like the united States?.

No its not. Its illegal to fire them based on their political views. They can suggest any political view they want. . An employer says: I believe that if you don't vote for my guy I'll be forced to let you go. It's just a statement of belief and nothing more /s. How would the employer know who the employee voted for?. If the employee keeps his opinions to himself then he has nothing to worry. If the employee decides to exercise his 1st amendment like a boss then he should have a lawyer on retainer.. 1st amendment doesnt protect you from a private company firing you for saying something.

This is bollocks, you're supposed to live on 1600 calories a day? I guess this works for anyone who doesn't actually move during the day. wtf. If you're overweight, like more than half the population there, then yeah thats a good number to shoot for.. If you're overweight you should be eating less meals, not redefining how much food is in one 'meal' lol. This is just a way for them to charge you more for less food.. Actually eating three smaller meals a day is better for weight loss than not eating . Actually that's incorrect. Eating less calories, no matter how you choose to space them out, will result in weight loss. That's just a scientific fact. >Eating less calories, no matter how you choose to space them out, will result in weight loss.   And eating smaller meals is more sustainable than skipping meals.

This is horrible. Rape is rape, no matter if she/he is sexually active or not.. Pretty sure that having some random shove two fingers in you under duress counts as some kind of sexual assault, too.. A standard rape kit here in the U.S. will be as or even more invasive. Granted they'll probably use a speculum and/or colposcope to take swabs and visualize any genital injury. . You have to agree there is a fundamental difference between a rape kit and testing if you are sexually active with fingers. Especially when the later is likely only used against you.. Oh the latter it's total bullshit. Just saying getting a rape kit anywhere can be a nightmare and is always invasive to some degree. . Rape kits aren't forced on people though.

Wasn't the Vietnamese military Outpost actually on a ship stuck on a very small, but very real, island?. That was the Philippines.  The ship 'accidentally' rammed and stuck on the reef, the day after US bombed Chinese embassy in Belgrade, anticipating Chinese lack of resource to respond in 2 fronts.. to respond to a bombing in Eastern Europe while all of their forces were  in SEA?  Was the PAVN gearing up for Serbia?. mainly diplomatic resources, but I assume PLA couldn't absolutely rule out that it was a prelude to full attack on China too.

In my experience running with weights is a terrible idea. Ive never seen any serious runner doing it or recommending it.. Except for the entire military.. They dont train just to run fast, they train to run fast with 40kg of luggage on their backs and heavy boots on their feet. If thats your goal then maybe some training with weight is a good idea..

Tim Hortons made almost $100 000 000 in Q3 2017. They are doing fine. They can afford the $8 extra an hour to staff the place. . You are confusing the corporation with a franchisee owner.

Try to not be such a condescending asshole, on the internet and in your day to day life.  . You can't take a poor person to the bank, so your comment makes no sense.   bye bye. Great praxis.

Because they're totally going to tell us when they will act on it. No problem at all. Who the fuck cares about the child victims?. Yes, by all means, let's execute people for thoughts in their head. That's the mark of a civilized world.. When did I say that?. You implied it, in context with public executions for rapists and not pedophiles.  Edit: Have you read 1984? You really should, if not. It addresses exactly what you're implying; Thought-Police.

You're assuming the Dems can get their shit together and put forth a decent candidate. Though I'm pretty sure Yog Soggoth would be better than Trump.. If they nominate Hillary again, the Dems might lose in 2020. I mean there are other options, but everyone seems to be hyping up Hillary again.. Ummm, seriously?

I dont get why these developed countries need any of our aid when were $20T in debt and possibly going to default in the coming years . Its not so much aid as it is a bribe. Israel is an important military and intelligence ally in a stategic location. A ton of our intel on terrorists comes from the Israelis.. If werent overpaying by the billions on military equipment we could probably, in my opinion, afford to get intel on terrorists on our own

A new government report recommends introducing fixed fines to tackle the problem.. Why is it a problem?. Because it smells like burnt shit wrapped in foliage.. Yet we're not banning fires, shit, or foliage. It smells bad isn't a good enough reason. Try again.. Cigarettes get segregated to keep the general public's breathing air clear. You can smoke all you want, just sit your butt down in the smoking area first.. Yeah, kind of a different issue from fining people for smoking it in the first place though, isn't it?. >Why is it a problem?  was the question. Now you have the problem and the solution :p

Where in any definition of ethnic cleansing does it require specific immigration papers or status?. They aren't deporting Africans that legally migrated though. Which means that it isn't really an ethnic cleansing.. They trespassed across the border with Egypt until Israel built a fence. Now they're being sent back.

t1_dsk0ja8	0	*	Top German court overturns 'Sharia Police' acquittal. No upvotes and no comments. Hmm.. What does that indicate? What's the, Hmm.. Because any criticism of Muslims is not allowed. People criticise islam all the time. Some people criticize Islam and find themselves subject to a fatwa, sent to prison, or in a morgue for doing so. e.g. Ayan Hirsi Ali, Salman Rushdie, Sina Deghan, Ahok, Charli Hebdo staff and so on. . Some. But not most. Some people criticise almost everything and get attacked for doing to. To equate some people with 'any criticism at all' is deliberate misinformation.

I have already seen some online stores add a service charge to all orders within the last week.. It shouldn't be allowed. The price listed is the price you should pay. I don't care if the supermarket has expenses for heating and cooling. Don't give me a cooling charge when buying milk either.. But it shows you the price, when you go to checkout it normally says the price and will say 50p surcharge, I honestly dont see why this is getting banned, if the fees were hidden sure but they are not. It's getting banned because banks and governments don't want you to use cash.. If so that is bullshit

Probably should have talked to his daughter about pervs, forbidden her from talking to him and informed proper authorities.. Reddit prefers pitchforks and mob justice. . You can sort of have both. Proper justice most of the time, but just enough vigilantism to act as an added deterrent.. You could have just said hell yeah we do.

t1_dueqr15	0	*	Argentina man poses as 11-year-old daughter online, confronts and beats up pedophile stalking her. The father doing this will likely lessen the perpetrator's prison sentence.   It's nice to take action into your own hands, until it doesn't work out in your own or other peoples favour. . How does him being beaten up for being a disgusting pedophile reduce the sentence for his crimes?. A judge needs to sentence him for his crimes, and his lawyer will likely ask for a reduced sentence as a result of this assault.. the 2 aren't related. the father being guilty of assault has no bearing on the victims stalking and pedophilia. . It can certainly play in part to his sentencing, they are directly related.  The father didn't beat him because he had a punchable face.. And we should listen to you because.... 
t1_dsifksx	1	*	New York City plans to divest $5bn from fossil fuels and sue oil companies for contributing to global warming. Huh, it will be interesting to see how that goes.  I'd really like to see the US cut all fossil fuel subsidies.  Is that likely to happen anytime soon?  Not even remotely.. Not as long as world renowned lizard person, and proud destroyer of physical hearts, and owner of one that's not his own, Dick Cheney has any say in the matter.. Not as long as 90% of Americans use gas or diesel powered vehicles, either.. If I could afford to go electric, I would. Unfortunately, it's expensive and most Americans don't make nearly enough to buy in.. If electric cars got the subsidy money oil companies get, i wonder how cheap they could be.. Hush, don't point out the reality of the status quo :O! It's scary!

It's not quite as bad as cigs. but it still stains everything and the smell infiltrates everything the same way cigs do.... I've tested it out and it doesn't . Few people smoke pot all day every day.

Ah yes, it's okay that you're treated unequally because occasionally it's comfortable discrimination.. Im just saying if you want to discriminate against men atleast give the benefits, too. Personally, no discrimination would be the ideal.
t1_dsjucbt	1	*	Germany sees 2.2% growth in 2017 (biggest in 6 years) and record surplus of 38.4bn.. Hahaha 2.2% is sooooooo pathetic. That is amazing. Considering that the inflation rate in Germany is around 1.5%. This is like.. really pathetic... good for a socialist country, I guess. . US gdp growth is at 2.5% with an inflation rate of 2.2%. Not that much difference. And how big was your budget surplus again?. What's a surplus? :(. Every government has an annual budget to spend on things. This year Germany earned 38.4 billion Euros more than they spent.. It was sarcasm. The US hasn't had a surplus since the early 2000s.. They also didn't have to bail out half of europe and millions of welfare immigrants, kind of impressive germany managed to have a surplus while wasting money on so much stupid things.
t1_du62mxa	1	*	Donald Trump warns Israel its settlements are 'complicating' search for Middle East peace. yeah... something tells me bulldozing someone's home would not inspire peaceful feelings.... Nonsense they're bulldozing them because they're antisemites that want to push them into the sea  edit: some people cant take a joke.. > they're antisemites that want to push them into the sea  That much is true for nearly all Arabs.. 2002 Arab Peace Plan. I too would be looking to cover my ass after the whole 911 incident. I can't blame the KSA for trying.. And Arafat and the Palestinians have been calling for peace since the late 80s
t1_duicc3t	1	*	Gates says billionaires should pay 'significantly' more taxes. I think we need to start spending the tax money we have much more efficiently.. This has been tried and failed many times. Government employees have no incentive to actually spend money effectively. . Why not address that?. Because it's impossible.. Your world is dark. . The truth is not always pleasant. The government is by nature corrupt and ineffective.
t1_dui3o6s	1	*	Gates says billionaires should pay 'significantly' more taxes. I think we need to start spending the tax money we have much more efficiently.. Why not both!. Because if one is done correctly, the other isn't needed.. Do both, surplus is not a bad thing.. And that is why you can always pay more taxes than mandated minimum requirements.  How much extra are you paying?. I'll gladly pay at the rate I think someone of my income level should have. Redistributing from rich to poor is my goal. I'm middle class. 
t1_dui9loo	1	*	Gates says billionaires should pay 'significantly' more taxes. You know there is an option for him to pay more... Its literally right on the tax forms. . So what? Hes advocating more progressive tax system, a very common political stance.. So what? We already have a progressive tax structure, thats very common knowledge.. Ah yes, the fuck the poor system, love it!. Seems like the rich get fucked more by a progressive tax system.. >  the rich get fucked   *snort*

How much extra are you paying?. We'd have to raise taxes to balance the budget first, glad to see you're on board though!
t1_duib8u2	1	*	Gates says billionaires should pay 'significantly' more taxes. I think we need to start spending the tax money we have much more efficiently.. No no no no no no! Clearly the American government is flawless and knows exactly the best ways to allocate its funds for the benefit of the average US citizen.. I thought it was only the military spending which couldn't ever waste anything. It's the other programs that are wasteful. DoD doesn't waste money.  /s. war is big business that employs tons of middle class..  Literally we'd go deep into recession if we ended our warmongering ways..  . Just because we've grown to rely on it doesn't mean it's the right thing to do. 100% agree  just is what it is at this point.
t1_du247dw	0	*	Israeli military says it has carried out a large scale attack against Iranian targets in Syria.. Good, keep it going until the terrorists are taken care of.

If you have Reddit you have Google, pal.
t1_ds6r4gy	1	*	Spanish government cuts Catalan budget by 780m. What checks exist in Spain to prevent Catalan from simply withholding their taxes to the Spanish Government? . A state police force willing to beat the shit out of anyone the King tells them to.. But doesn't Catalan have their own police force?   And who exactly would they beat? If Catalan uses, say, Switzerland for their banking, how could Spain extract the funds? . Is Switzerland part of the EU? If so, I'm sure that either they will say no thanks, or the EU will order them not to do it.. Switzerland are not apart of the EU. Ah, thank you.  The EU could still try to pressure Switzerland to avoid that.
t1_dsezivr	0	*	French town bans pork-free school meals in move branded 'anti-Muslim'. Tbh just have a pork free meal for them and make them pay for it ffs. . They already pay for their meal. They pay for A meal. I agree that it could be planned as the meat could be served separately which would please all sides. . The issue I see with that is, not all meals can have the meat separate as it's part of the dish.. Self services solve that issue generally with generally or a meat or fish option but not every school as it especially on the lower school levels.. You're really going to let children self service?

Also, soy and corn is in the majority of cow feed. Brazil produces 22% of the world's beef. It's okay though, it's not like we need forests that absorbs 20% of the worlds CO2 annually.. But let's all attack Canada's oil industry.. it's not an either or thing.... It seems to be, because people here seems to not give a shit about what happens as long as it's not in Canada.. You're literally commenting in a post not about Canada.
t1_dtcwgh2	1	*	The Amazon rainforest is being burned down faster than ever before to plant fields of corn and soy for processed foods. Slow your meat consumption, American. . Talk to China and India, as well.. America eats 120kg of meat per year per person.  China eats 58kg and India eats 4.4kg.  . Thats because the majority of those populations are poor, not by choice. . Well then whats the point of telling them to slow down meat consumption when theyre already slow?. Im just saying that if the average population of those countries were as wealthy as the average population of America those numbers would not be as low. 
t1_dtcpwxy	0	*	The Amazon rainforest is being burned down faster than ever before to plant fields of corn and soy for processed foods. Stop eating meat assholes. Because clearly people who eat naturally are assholes and it's their fault! /s. Factory farms are natural!. Moron, where did I say factory farms?. Oh shoot, you don't get your meat from factory farms huh?  Do you get it from your friends uncle who treats all his livestock like family?. You can't blame meat eaters. It's just illogical.
t1_dtcok85	0	*	The Amazon rainforest is being burned down faster than ever before to plant fields of corn and soy for processed foods. Why isn't multi level farming a big thing yet? We would literally make a ton more food, with a lot less water, little to no pesticides, and less land. . Difficult to beat the efficiency of a field with a building attempting to recreate the conditions of a field, particularly for low value bulk crops.. Maybe you can beat the efficiency, but you can't beat the set-up cost.. It costs practically nothing to set up high tunnels and you get a partially controlled environment out of it.  Vertical farming is only feasible in specific circumstances where land is at a premium.. It costs exactly nothing to cut down trees and throw seeds on the ground. . Aight. Ill throw you out in my backyard woods naked tomorrow morning. I expect a tilled and sown field by sundown, son. And I aint paying you a goddamned cent.

Also, soy and corn is in the majority of cow feed. Brazil produces 22% of the world's beef. It's okay though, it's not like we need forests that absorbs 20% of the worlds CO2 annually.. Trees could always be planted elsewhere.... It's not just trees. Rainforests are a climate that host rare flora and fauna that simply do not and can not exist anywhere else. Once a rainforest is gone, they're gone forever.. Ok, well we need solutions that don't rely on corrupt governments to do the right thing.  I don't know what those are, but complaining about it isn't getting things done.. Thanks for the lecture. 
t1_dtfyu00	1	*	Indian-origin principal in the UK branded 'Hitler' because she banned hijab in school. Well, banning hijab in school and killing millions of people is about the same thing, so this sounds reasonable.. Hitler did not kill a religious minorities (jews) right away, he passed laws against them first.... Not what comes to mind first though. Strictly speaking every amateur painter can be called Hitler by those standards.. Dont dig a deep whole, we both know when things started to happen. Its like calling humans hitler because hitler was human. . You are such a coward. You can't make decisions or call it how it is. . You are the coward. Don't take peoples religious freedoms away. You are worse than shit.

China giving a lesson on how to stifle disent via arbitrary arrests. . Which historically leads to revolution.. Tianamen was somewhat close but the people there were protesting not armed fighters. . Only a matter of time and oppression.. China has a really high approval rating from its citizens and it's not because of fear.
t1_dtslwje	0	*	Finland seeks to abolish Daylight Saving Time from the European Union. As a programmer, I can totally agree with this.  Lets eliminate as many stupid confusing unnecessary constructions as possible.. Its not stupid and unnecessary. . So what's the reason to hang onto this, then?  Seriously asking as few seem to have a legitimate reason why DST is a good thing.. Extra light at the end of the day when people are not at work so that they can go walk their dog and sit in the park etc.   Is that reason valid enough for you?  . Its a number. Get up one hour earlier. You dont have to sleep to 7 all year long if you want extra light. Get up at 6 half of the year instead.. Saying it's a number as an argument is not very effective. Why get rid of DST then if it's just a number? Get up one hour earlier/later, it's just a number. 
t1_dtrl5l8	0	*	Finland seeks to abolish Daylight Saving Time from the European Union. It's about time, we need to get rid of it everywhere. It just creates extra confusion with timezones.. Should get rid of timezones too. Use UTC all around the world.. One Earth Time *would* be better.  That would be *incredible*, actually. But, it's unlikely, as people suck at change.. I strive to only think about time as an Epoch value.. I like you..     0x49, 0x20, 0x6c, 0x69, 0x6b, 0x65, 0x20, 0x79,     0x6f, 0x75, 0x2c, 0x20, 0x74, 0x6f, 0x6f, 0x2e,     0x0a

If someone attempted to eradicate your kin,  I'm sure you'd be just as angry.. They did. I'm not. My kin survived the ww2 bombings in the Netherlands.. You moved on. But, Israel is pursuing criminals that can actually be put to justice.. It's just for political points, no justice to be had. Too long ago. Israel itself is guilty of more recent war crimes. Prosecute them.. If Israel is to be prosecuted, you might as well prosecute every poor soul brainwashed by groups like the PLO.

A rich person tends to pay upwards of 35 to 40% of there income. . Right but not the corporations, like Dupont and GE pay nothing....

Trump still ends up getting credit for that somehow. /s. Let him take credit, it won't save his disasterous presidency.. it's a disaster in the eyes of salty liberals who still thinks hilary is the champion for feminist movement.  meanwhile everyone else is laughing straight to the bank.. >meanwhile everyone else is laughing straight to the bank.

Why has the Atheist and Agnostic religions been excluded from the new leak site?  I dont see The Church of Satan listed either.  Very interesting indeed.. No Church of Satan?!    Could that be because its largely a joke, and has 1 member for every 1000000 members of other religions?. They probably rape little boys less as well.

t1_duc82xg	1	*	Irish based drugmaker has put a price tag of almost $3,000 on a bottle of two-in-one painkillers that can be bought separately for $36. if ireland is anything like USA i'm sure they did spend a ton on testing. But it begs the obvious idea: why not just buy separately?. Testing what? It's two OTC drugs. You don't think they spend tens of millions of dollars testing a single OTC drug in the US?. When they're first released, yeah. These have been on the market for decades and were already often used together. They are clearly screwing people, but there are also expenses - getting a drug through the FDA is insanely expensive.  A new perumutation of existing drugs still has to be tested.. Except they're still selling it for 30 in Ireland. They're just seeing what they can get away with

So your only problem with the guy is he isn't good at getting the right permits?. He don't even want to get permit. They often apply to several places at the same time and then *choose place where permit was rejected*. Ilias Mercury caught them doing that. It's disgusting

A ponzi scheme doesn't need a centralized figure- that role can be collectivized.

t1_dtovaqe	0	*	Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny detained by police at Moscow rally (Navalny on Twitter). I'm very interested in seeing how we will look back on Russia and Putin in 50 years. It doesn't seem like anything is changing dispite the crazy stories coming from there.. Putin will die (or become weak and be imprisoned) and the ensuing power struggle will ruin the country again.. Yes, he ensured he has no successor, setting up a colossal power struggle once he's gone.. Let's hope the smart and moral, become the most ruthless and powerful in a power struggle.. Last time the smart and moral did that in Russia, we got the USSR, which reddit despises .. But they weren't smart or moral. That is why they created the USSR. Otherwise they would have created something much smarter wouldn't they?

This kind of unrest makes me think WW3 is right around the corner.. People fighting in an airport is ww3????. I said around the corner, learn to read.  Its a precursor showing that there are tensions building to the point where normal people are now brawling in airports.. Like a decade ago, maybe longer, there was a brawl in an Australian airport where a dude got decapitated with one of those damn portable fence post thibgys.. Neat, that hardly is the same.. Exactly. No one got decapitated.

Feel free to correct my ignorance. But does this even matter? The Chinese people can't vote for their leader, so it hardly makes much difference if Jinping stays on..

As Olympic athletes, they are probably living in *relatively* good conditions, so the temptation is lower.. Based on Aquariums of Pyongyang, wanting to have a family to come back to is probably also a pretty strong motivator to return.. Aquariums?.

Do wolves eat boar? The military domain has an overpopulation of them, people are encouraged to hunt them.. If it were a lone wolf versus a lone boar I'd put my money on the pig. Which is why wolves prefer group hunting.. And why most predators tend to not hunt boars very often, humans included.. Nothing one well placed shot can't solve.   And they're good eating, win/win.

Wondered if anyone believes that Assange is truly guilty of the charges applied than to a witch-hunt which is driven by political motives.. Sure I do. He was on bail and skipped out on it, he's clearly guilty of skipping bail and should stand trial for it.. And risk extradition to the US where they might execute him.  . A fear the judge today said she did not find reasonable. And for good reason. Because it's a fucking ludicrous argument that requires inhuman levels of mental gymnastics to accept as reasonable.. He's not been in hiding for years to escape a charge which carries a maximum sentence of 18 months in a UK prison.  He certainly believes he will be extradited.. But he doesn't need to be arrested in UK / Sweden for him to be extradited. He was talking around London for months before jumping into the embassy.

Then Nasser provoked a war with Israel in 1967.. You mean Israel started a war with Egypt. . Blockading Israeli shipping was already an act of war, technically speaking.. Also Egypt mobilised first and expelled UN peacekeepers from Sinai after the USSR for some reason gave false intelligence to Syria that Israel was going to attack them....

It provokes trade wars.  . 50% of US steel exports go to Canada, so it's not like they wouldn't feel it if we went tit for tat here... In the end nobody wins.. China wins. Who do you think both Canada and the USA trade with the most, not counting each other? China is going to pick up some discount contracts.. Lots of bid out US contracts specifically refuse Chinese steel because its such crap quality. I don't see that changing, more likely that cost is just passed on to the consumer.. The reason for that is China only exports low-grade steel, the high quality stuff is reserved for domestic use.

I'd rather a hundred scares than for the guy that sounds the alarm to hesitate when he thinks he sees something. . 100 scares and people will start ignoring them.. From a town in Illinois with oversensitive Tornado sirens, can confirm. . There is no such thing as over sensitive tornado sirens.  They don't automatically go off when the wind picks up.. I guess frequent tornado watches but rare tornado warnings would count.. Precisely. Sirens would go off for a watch not just warnings. Many false alarms. Where Im from, the reaction to the siren became all of us running outside to look at the sky.

There's actually a bazooka in use today that has a 9mm rifle attached to it and it is called the Shoulder-launched Multi-purpose  *Assault* Weapon.. There are also training versions of rocket launchers that fire 9 mm rounds instead. Useful if you want to practice using them without having to pay for a rocket each time you pull the trigger.

By all accounts, that month should be October, but he had to shift it afaik.. No, since it was a 10-month year, summer would fall on a different set of months every year, which is why Caesar added Jan and Feb to align the year with the seasons

I don't like investment banks with its ponzi scheme-ish approach on everything.. What is it you think a world bank should do if not invest in things?. The World Bank shouldn't exist in the first place for encouraging more debt through loans. It basically encourages more capitalism which is a bad thing.. Lack of access to investment funds (on non-predatory terms) is a MAJOR handicap for projects in developing economies..

Well, that was kind of why Muslims wanted Pakistan in the first place.  But BJP has gone too far.  I love India, but it's starting to give me the creeps.. Self-creating prophecies in this case. What happened to all the non-Muslims in Pakistan? Muslims feared persecution from Hindu but then they persecuted everyone else. . > Muslims feared persecution   Same story everywhere you find muslims. Crying persecution while they massacre others.. Like in Myanmar?  Lemme guess that's a conspiracy and the army doing the genocide is the real victim? . Honestly I have no idea what the history in that particular part of the world is but the trend is the same even if this one data point completely contradicts it.. So it's a case of I don't know something happens therefore it doesn't happen as expected.

You are arguing against the publishing of the truth ... how can you say this is a negative thing?. I'm arguing they selectively released material to influence the election.

Let's not forget all the murder and kidnapping... these guys paid for a few basketballs!. It's amazing what you can afford to do if you don't bother making your money legitimately. . Thanks NRA!

t1_dt9cb1c	0	*	Donald Trump says US would consider remaining in TPP. Here's the part where they require members of the Treaty also become members of the Paris Climate Agreement.. Being a part of the Paris Climate Agreement is like going to a museum with a suggested donation for entry. . Given how stupid half the American public and the President is, going to the Museum may not be such a bad idea  Based on what you just said maybe you could use a visit too. Why do you say that? . Even if US was a taken signatory of the Paris climate agreement it is better than not being one. It allows people other than climate change deniers/ignorant to look forward to a better future. What the hell made you presume I felt otherwise? Also, if I didnt believe in human-caused climate change, you could perhaps use softer methods of persuasion.

Whatever you come up with is going to have to have *some* kind of longish bit of narrow flexible tubing, and somebody's going to stick their mouth on that. . Titanium straws are a thing now for a fair few years.. Doubt it's anything more than stainless steel. Titanium would be both extremly heavy and cost a hell of a lot to buy, let alone manufacture.. Titanium = heavy.... so your just a troll, ok, good job, bye bye.

So this is how the world ends, not with a bang but with a staph infected whimper. . If the game Plague Inc taught me anything, its that Greenland will be fine. Madagascar shuts it's ports down if a baby in Siberia farts. . There should really be another level down after that, like population shifts within the country attempting to flee, rafts across water to the next country, things like that.. And people with big guns on the coast to shoot anyone attempting to come in illegally with their bacteria infested asses.  That would add a nice effect..

Right up until the cunting moron farmers (both foreign and domestic) raped the poodle in a ditch and ruined it for the entire species.. Don't worry, though.  They got rich doing it.

Do they sell those chickens in the US? . They might not be selling those, but Colistin is still being used in US and EU markets as of now.   The use of critical antibiotics is being phased out however in the next 2 years.. So, what's the reason that we aren't up in arms about their use in US and EU?. I suppose cuz in India the government hasn't realised it yet or aren't taking steps.   The use is being phased out in EU and US markets. No such steps have been taken by the Indian government. . Because it's India. Anything that works in the short term is generally accepted here. . True.

This stuff costs over $500 for a one month supply! If they can afford to smother chickens in it, why the hell does it cost so much in the US???. Probably produced generically locally (legally or not) for cents on the dollar.. Implying the original isn't produced for pennies and sold for hundreds of dollars, because they can.... R&D can cost billions... . I wonder why people keep spread lies that they get told by those companies. In the EU where medication is generally cheaper, the R&D costs are covered in an average of three years.. Do you want the r&d costs of an antibiotic covered in three years? India can help...  Edit: India will help by selling tons of it to chicken farmers

That is actually the point. It should never be used as it would mean that all other antibiotics have failed.. And I believe it causes liver damage which is why it's last resort.. It's also a last resort because it's the strongest we have, so if anything gets resistance to it, we're fucked unless we find other means of fighting infections. . Oh we do... for example amputation. . Ah, the good old nuclear option.

In his mind he is not offending anyone since he is the only one that matters to him.. I sometimes wonder how much of Obama's WH correspondent speech  affected him.

Yet they're surrounded by dictatorships who all want to wipe them off the face of the earth. Probably because they were created by fiat in a country that already had a local population. . Or because theyre Jewish. . Why not both?

Yeah, way to parrot a stat and completely ignore all the negative externalities if alcohol vs tobacco.  You can enjoy throwing it in a pan as you are so fond of, but it is a scourge on society.

Now explain if it is fair that China can do this but prevent other foreign entities from doing the same in China. I'm right so deal with it.

Am first year osteopath student.   What makes the training less rigorous compared to an allopath?. Osteopathic schools are less selective than medical schools.. That says absolutely nothing about the coursework.

I would choose the least morally objectionable one. But hey, continue to support awful companies because they make the best cars, supposedly..

I'm sure if trump shows Baron the same amount of love his father showed him we will all be swimming in blood when it is Baron's turn in the throne..

Beijing said global warming meant viable routes through the Arctic would become important for international trade. China would work with Russia and other Arctic countries to develop the route.. This will be interesting since any global route will need to run through Canada and Canada considers the Arctic it's sovereign territory.. Well, the parts of it that run through Nunavut.  There is another route that goes across Russia which China can also use to get to Europe.. Canada can build Islands, and accuse China of violating it's Sovereignty if it uses those waters.. Canada doesn't even have the capability of enforcing its claimed sovereignty to waters between its own islands.  The idea of even doing so is something that is relatively new.. Im sure the US would be happy to oblige the neighbors. Were already sailing all around the SCS, we could spare some ships to help Canada defend their sovereign waters.. Nope.

Like every other president in our lifetimes was willing to provide.. And how would they help, we already know he sold the property for 100 million. What would the tax returns tell you?. So you aren't actually interested in proof then. Got it.. Proof of what? We already know about the deal, again what will the tax return tell you?

t1_du4jmea	0	*	Trump sold a $40 million estate to a Russian oligarch for $100 millionand a senator wants to know why. I feel like I've read this before. . Probably because it happened 10 years ago.. The article is new though.  No matter, corruption is as old as civilization itself.. People have been flipping foreclosed properties since the 1960's ya dingus. . Foreclosure doesnt mean they go for 2.5x less than market value. . Actually, yes that's exactly what it means, look it up!
t1_du4nme2	0	*	Trump sold a $40 million estate to a Russian oligarch for $100 millionand a senator wants to know why. Russians are stupid at real estate deals. Look at Alaska!. Buy high sell low. This guy cryptos. This is good for dogecoin. I just checked 1 dogecoin = 1 dogecoin   So indeed it is good for dogecoin. I denominate all my purchases in Dogecoin.

He wins BIGLY in all his deals. He knows the art of the deal. Believe me!. Probably didn't read it.. Probably didn't write it.. But it was not than likely written by good people. The best people, actually.

t1_du4iuh1	0	*	Trump sold a $40 million estate to a Russian oligarch for $100 millionand a senator wants to know why. Sounds like a good deal to me.. Yeah, one president for only 100 million. Americans are cheap these days.. What kind of logic is this? You mean that an ordinary transaction between two businessmen ten years ago was somehow an attempt to bribe Trump? . Ordinary transaction you mean money laundering?. I dont think he meant that no, he meant ordinary transaction.. Which it really was
t1_ds8r658	1	*	Ancient Mexican structure is a miniature model of the universe, say archaeologists: Underwater shrine appears to represent the beginning of space and time in Mesoamerican mythology.. > Ancient Mexican structure is a 'miniature model of the universe', say archaeologists  No, *one* archaeologist said he thinks it could be.  But w/e, *ancient myths and stuff, man*.. If the thumbnail is what theyre talking about...it looks like a clitoris to me. My clit is truly the center of *my* universe, wish it got worshipped more often.. Tho I think it'd be more worshipped if it was easier to gain access to the inner sanctum. It's more a thing of the priest class nowadays.. You have to know the tongue in which to speak.  A careful cunning linguist. . Cunilingus what?. You're sharp. 
t1_dsfucf0	1	*	US has to buy Russian natural gas as consumer prices soar. Not really surprising, albeit very hilarious, considering that Russian prices are much, much lower than any US alternatives. . That's what happens when you pay workers pennies on the dollar.. It's much cheaper to live in Russia. So their pennies are worth quite a bit more. . The U.S. is the largest producer of natural gas in the world, they are not importing it from Russia good ole RT.. The US isn't importing it. Companies are and they'll buy anything that is cheaper. . Ah yes good point.

Visit Saudi Arabia and travel back in time to 500ad.  -ministry of Saudi tourism and enslavement. that pre-dates Islam, I dont think people would be able to stomach Saudi arabia before they were made more reasonable by Islam.... > made more reasonable by Islam  kek. up until the last few centuries, islam was more progressive than christianity in many aspects. . yes, up until the last 15 centuries. the dark ages were not 15 centuries ago.  Islam is not even 15 centuries old yet. 
t1_dsl6axk	1	*	Donald Trump lauds delivery of F-52 planes to Norway; planes only exist in Call of Duty. Is this a joke?. I read it was 52 of the F-35 in another thread earlier today. So he messed his words up a little. Some how it's breaking news. . Its just pieces of evidence regarding his incompetence. . Getting some words or numbers mixed up when speaking is not incompetence.. Bar is higher when you're President. No, the president is still a human who makes human mistakes.
t1_ds35nlh	0	*	Germany removes little-used statute against insulting foreign heads of state that let Erdogan sue comic from criminal code. Fuck Erdogan. . I honestly can't understand why he has any supporters left in mainland europe. . Uneducated Turks. . But most Turks in the EU are reasonably well educated.. You sure?. At a minimum they are at least educated better than Turks still stuck in Turkey... Where evolution is no longer taught in schools...
t1_ds2s9o6	0	*	Germany removes little-used statute against insulting foreign heads of state that let Erdogan sue comic from criminal code. So can we get Bxf6hmi to read his poem again now?. Millions of Germans can continue to say that W.Bush fucking sucked. Yes.. And we all see the irony in agreeing that W. Bush really wasn't so bad after all.  *edit*: Jesus guys, I seem to have forgotten how crappy Bush was?. W.Bush did a lot of retarded things that ruined the US economy.  But at least he was professional. He did the whole representational part of the presidency well.  Trump does neither.. Bush also messed up quite a bit regarding international travel and how muslims are treated and feared.. Compared to Trump he's a class act.

You cant get on pornhub in sk without a vpn tho.... all adult sites (that aren't blocked) require you to enter your Korean SSN.. Lol thats a problem when youre american and visiting your relatives and youre a horny teenager (me). L2VPN. VPN will get you the blocked sites, but not the ones that require your SSN.. the point of using a VPN in this case is to mask your exit point.

She shit her bed, everyone found out so she blamed it on the bed.  Nice job pentagon, way to shit the bed . your sister has kinky friends. My sister has shitty friends  :/  . at least she has friends :(. A solitary life is king when compared to the company of shitty people.  . thought you wanted to be my friend, allas all is lost for me.
t1_du3e3bj	0	*	A South Korean actress has accused Berlin film festival organisers of hypocrisy for inviting a director who assaulted her to this year's event while promoting it as a forum to tackle abuse in the industry.. Why is it so hard to just not invite this guy?. Because the accusations apparently didn't hold up in a court . Seems they agreed he slapped her around. That's enough.. It really isn't.. To not invite him to a platform against abuse? Wtf it absolutely is.. IN your world, do people ever get a chance to learn or grow?
t1_dsklsws	0	*	Ecuador grants citizenship to Assange. I am curious what support Ecuador got for accepting him in the first place. As an Ecuadorian, I have no idea. Correa just decided to do it, and I don't know anyone who actually really supports having him in the embassy.. Kickbacks from Russia perhaps.. Yeah I wouldn't be surprised if there's silently a few million dollars slipped in a bank account in the cayman islands under the Ecuadorian President's name. Courtesy of his new best friend (putin). Of all the dumb conspiracy theories.... I know!!  Putin is always so legal in his moves!!

Enjoy your day.. *Sigh* https://www.spectator.co.uk/2017/05/brexit-is-an-opportunity-for-the-uk-based-car-industry-to-change-up-a-gear/.

The politicians lost the referendum and they are intentionally fucking it up dragging their feet is news?. Like intention were needed here...  Anyhow, you posted some arbitrary newspaper article, so did I. Leads us exactly to what? 
t1_dv0re9u	0	*	Marine Le Pen: French far-right leader charged over Isis tweets. Charged for showing people what Isis is really about. Hmm I thought journalists were supposed to do that... and not get charged. . Well, Le Pen is neither a journalist nor is she being held to the American version of free speech Donalds, as it appears you think is the case.. Or any free speech apparently. What's she getting charged with? As an American this is unthinkable to me. As an American lots of things are unthinkable to you.. Ya, such as why we saved y'alls ass in work war two. (:. Well in fairness we were attacked which is why we got into the war.  We didnt do it to save the French. 
t1_dv1gw5p	1	*	Marine Le Pen: French far-right leader charged over Isis tweets. If she wasn't a right wing leader this would have never been an issue. . Lol maybe the others just prefer to follow the rules of their country. People who blindly follow rules are the worst. . Exactly why nepotism is literally what's running America. 'Lets elect someone who doesn't follow rules'. Yes it would have been much less nepotistic if we had another Clinton or bush.. 'Joseph Kennedy III will give the Democratic response to the State of the Union......'
t1_dv1pzdl	1	*	Marine Le Pen: French far-right leader charged over Isis tweets. Charged for showing people what Isis is really about. Hmm I thought journalists were supposed to do that... and not get charged. . She's charged for posting gore and without the deceased's permission. Should could have been as verbally graphic as she wanted.. So if someone posts a picture of a Holocaust victim is that a crime? Or is there some exception because of how long ago that happened? . Depends on how gory probably.  Depends on how old the picture is and if they know who it is.. So you are saying this law is extremely flexible and an ideal tool for going after the enemies of those in power?. No, but go ahead and put words in my mouth.
t1_dtulcm9	0	*	Elon Musk's Falcon rocket launches successfully. Succes Even though they lost a main core, reminds me of how they said the last one that failed completely was a partial success. The goal was to launch a payload into orbit. Everything else was a bonus. They succeeded in achieving the mission parameters. . What else is on board? I haven't read much about this. A car, a dummy in a SpaceX spacesuit, and a towel. There's a sign that says Don't Panic and it was playing Space Oddity. . Nice! Why a towel?. It's the most important item a hitchhiker can have!
t1_dtusd3v	1	*	Elon Musk's Falcon rocket launches successfully. If nothing else of human race survives at least an alien civilisation may one day stumble across a car in space driven by a mannequin and conclude that we were just too batshit insane to survive.. That spacecraft needs to be at least 3x more air tight!. Why? Water freezes in space, it doesn't need to float, there's ice. though ice in space will sublimate.. not with a car on top of it. You still need to ensure that the water is kept in a pressurised container which means it will be air tight.
t1_dtumlgc	1	*	Elon Musk's Falcon rocket launches successfully. SpaceX's Falcon rocket  It's not like he built the whole thing himself.. thank you. labor erasure is very seriously annoying, especially considering musk isn't exactly known for treating his workers well.. Of particular note is that included in the launch was a plaque inscribed with the names of the 6,000 SpaceX staff that helped make the mission possible.. good! im glad. they really need more recognition.. Nobody's going to read the plaque. It's in space. Klingons will. Before they shoot it.

Russia interferes for the wrong reasons, because they are the bad guys.  We interfere for the right reasons, because we are the good guys. . Is this a joke or do you seriously believe this? I am concerned. Practically all of Latin America was interfered with by the US for the wrong reasons.. We also had Hillary on tape saying the US should rig the vote in Palestine..

t1_dshwuwg	1	*	Russia has interfered in 19 countries elections over 2 decades, report finds. a lot of whataboutism in this thread.  Its ok for russia to interfere in other countries' elections, because the US does it too  Well fuck the both of you. The US does it too is one thing.  However the actual scenario here is that the us does it MORE, the actual whataboutism, is the article itself.. Do you have a present source showing the United States doing so more in the past two decades specifically? Thank you for providing me with one. . Why is a time frame of two decades specifically noteworthy? . I'd imagine he said 2 decades because that's what the russian report is on. but who gives a shit? 20 years, 100 years, this year. I mean. Do you espionage or not i think is the question? To which the answer is a resounding Yes. 
t1_dshyilo	1	*	Russia has interfered in 19 countries elections over 2 decades, report finds. I hear Russia even interferes in Russian elections.. If you can even call it an election. At least they're marginally better than North Korean elections . I don't see how? Perhaps in the show part .The result is just as predictable.. Putin *technically* has opponents, and not all of them get executed.. Not yet at least 
t1_dshnwo9	0	*	Russia has interfered in 19 countries elections over 2 decades, report finds. I hear Russia even interferes in Russian elections.. If you can even call it an election. At least they're marginally better than North Korean elections . Life in North Korea isn't so bad. I hear the citizens can't complain.. They dont even have the obesity problems that plague America . Well, there's this one guy though.
t1_dshomdt	0	*	Russia has interfered in 19 countries elections over 2 decades, report finds. luckily for me as an american, my gov never interferes /s. There's the whataboutism. theres the 100th comment complaining about whataboutism. Well shit I wonder why, could it be you're trying to turn a thread discussing Russian interference in elections into a thread about Americans instead?  Nah that couldn't possibly be it. life is hard for a russian operative :(. A Russian operative is probably not an easy task to do.. You're simply an online tool.  No one pays you, you do it out of your own stupidity.  Congrats 
t1_dsitz0u	0	*	Russia has interfered in 19 countries elections over 2 decades, report finds. Jeez I hope there is no report about how many countries elections the US has interfered with.... I was just checking in to say the same thing  I am mystified by the weird hypocrisy about this. What hypocrisy though? Do you think a lot of us Americans are supportive of us meddling like that?. Do you vote?. Of course. Then why say youre not supportive?
t1_dshtl6p	1	*	Russia has interfered in 19 countries elections over 2 decades, report finds. luckily for me as an american, my gov never interferes /s. Russia interferes for the wrong reasons, because they are the bad guys.  We interfere for the right reasons, because we are the good guys. . Is this a joke or do you seriously believe this? I am concerned. Practically all of Latin America was interfered with by the US for the wrong reasons.. Hes clearly joking. Its obvious that the US interference in central and south america set many countries years back. . There's a solid documentary to be made on South America and the IMF. Most people don't realize how fucked over almost the entire continent got by that organization.. There's one called Life and Debt and it's a great documentary.

Russia interferes for the wrong reasons, because they are the bad guys.  We interfere for the right reasons, because we are the good guys. . It's funny how you always show up defending Russia in every thread.. Doesn't make him wrong. The US can't point fingers in that domain.. There are massive differences in US meddling and Russian meddling.   Also, this is not US that points it's fingers.. yeah lol, the US uses deathsquads

Will men be notified if women have filed false rape allegations? . You mean been convicted of lying to the police or just making an accusation?. Proven false not necessarily convicted. How do you 'prove it' without a conviction? . Confession without charges being filed.. I'd be surprised if that didn't cause a conviction.
t1_dtjbpd3	0	*	An Israeli legal rights group has said it is suing two New Zealanders for allegedly convincing the pop singer Lorde to cancel her performance in Israel, in what appears to be the first lawsuit filed under a contentious Israeli anti-boycott law.. So according to these guys youre not allowed to share your opinion with others if it involves criticism of Israel?. freedom of speech does not mean freedom from its consequences. . Please tell me how a lawsuit is a appropriate response to sharing your opinion with a popstar?. what sort of response did you expect?   BDS employs intimidation as a modus operandi.. sometimes it backfires.. Not this time, its just making these Israeli's look ridiculous. And if the case isn't thrown out it will make the entire country look ridiculous.  Sounds like a win for bds supporters . Ooo another 'win'.. Bbs is a cult.   Why are you whining when Israelis fight back? Because you won? No,. It's a delusion. 
t1_ds9lo4g	0	*	EU must end 'hypocrisy' of allowing Turkey to become a full member, says Emmanuel Macron. Correct, fuck Erdogan. Turkey's run for EU was long before him. The more democratic and western Turkey that everyone boasts about was not allowed into the EU.. Because they still had progress to make. Pre-Erdogan Turkey was worth praise because it was on the right path - nobody claimed that it was the finished article.. Turkey wasn't accepted into EU then and it's not accepted now. Greece and multiple Eastern European countries were accepted with weaker economies and higher levels of corruption. . Less authoritarian tendencies though. Greece hasnt had a coup since 75. Where as Turkey has had one ins 2016, 2007, 2004, 2003, 97, 93, 80, 71..... What the actual fuck??? Are you just allowed to pull numbers out of your ass now?

Seems a bit early for it.. ...71? . I know but it was looking a lot better before he went into office.... That happens when you learn we have contact with aliens but aren't allowed to tweet about it. If the US has contact with aliens, the president doesn't know about it. Any president.

You have to be 13 to join IIRC, but kids know how to get around that. Instagram is popular, owned by Facebook. There's even a messenger kids app.... Lol.  Right.  Hey, go ask some kids what they think of Facebook.    You know.  Just humor me.. Instagram is owned by Facebook, it's pretty much just an extension of it at this point. Go ask kids what they think about Instagram.  You know. Just humor me.. Do you consider 30 year olds kids?  Because it kinda seems like you do.. where on earth did you get that idea? By kids I mean middle-high schoolers.

Just google it and you'll see. . Ah, thanks. I knew it was pretty quick, just a bit peeved it took this long for Puerto Rico, when it was so fast for a country that's been effectively blockaded for the last 50 years.. That's because they have a functioning government.. Most of the US didn't lose power during the hurricane.. Most of the US isn't a corrupt shithole like PR.
t1_du4bdvc	1	*	Electricity restored to 75 percent of customers in Puerto Rico.. 75% in under 5 months! This is incredibl^^^y ^^^slow. Consider they basically have to rebuild the whole grid because the old one was dated and poorly maintained due to corruption. . Many seem to glaze over that fact.. Anything to turn it into an anti-Trump talking point for some people.. Bush had to own Katrina. Dont know why its different for trump. . The difference is because Puerto Rico had complete autonomy on building their infrastructure. States dont.

Where did I say Muller is the bad guy?  Do you...do you think I support Trump?. I guess you should post more carefully then.. You seem like a radical. Radical like MLK, Ghandi, Budda?
t1_dsb25gt	0	*	Mueller looking at Ivanka Trump's interaction with Russian lawyer at Trump Tower. Im sure he will find nothing. Yet again. Actually, there are four indictments of high ranking campaign advisors, good try!. An indictment is a formal accusation. Like this whole collusion crap. Its been over a year all they have is nothing.. No that is not what an indictment is...You left out what it is an accusation of.  A CRIME!  It is the FBI accusing you of a CRIME!. Sorry an accusation that is leading to legal proceedings. But still. No guilty parties. . Do you seriously think it is over, or that Mueller will come up empty-handed?
t1_dsanh8d	1	*	Mueller looking at Ivanka Trump's interaction with Russian lawyer at Trump Tower. I think its time for the Mueller team to put up or shut up. . You have absolutely no idea how these investigations work, do you?. On second thought, he should keep dragging it on. We keep finding out so much dirt on the Democrats and none on President Trump. . Yeah I mean inditiments..... are nothing..... I'm struggling to think of what dirt was dug up on the democrats too. Certainly not enough to indict Clinton, Obama, or anyone in their administration.... yeah I mean uranium one is totally is enough to send obama and hillary to jail I mean not like a fox news anchor told the actually facts.... oh wait.

This is classic putin bullshit as usual. It didn't fizzle it when winter temps hit. It fizzled out when the owner of the private park they were being allowed to use realized get weren't going anywhere any time soon and kicked them out. . There was more than one occupy movement in north America besides NYC. It was cold weather and zero public support that fizzled it out.. This actually is a common misconception. Occupy was taken down by a coordinated attack between Obama's DHS, FBI and city mayors office. They deliberately killed the movement. . Okay bud

Yeah, to be fair it is an accurate criticism of the US. Weve been huge hypocrites for a lil bit. by those standards every country in the world is a huge hypocrite . Yeah, but size matters. We are the preachy asshats who shove our values on everyone else and claim exceptionalism but then treat a decent percentage of our own population like shit. every country thinks they are the best
t1_ds4pz1k	0	*	Russia Says US Can't Criticize Iran Because It Crushed Occupy Wall Street and Ferguson. By that logic, how can Russia criticize the US, exactly?. Because the US has plenty to criticize. . So does Iran, and so does Russia.. So what? . Exactly the point. Not a point. The US is the country that goes around criticizing countries for doing exactly what they do. Russia doesn't.

Whataboutism. I may be in the wrong, but you are in no position to criticize me if you are in fact lynching negroes. Its not a philosophical debate, its pointing out hypocrisy.. Of course I'd be. If I say 3+2 = 6 and you say 2+2 = 5 it doesn't make you less wrong if I call you out, it makes us both wrong. . Yes, but youd be a hypocrite to do so. A serial killer is in no position to call out the moral failings of a speeder.

Id assumed they were boats of refugees trying to escape North Korea. . They didn't say what they died from either.. There isn't really a clear answer to what they died from.  It's assumed that it is due to lack of experience in sailing, or lack of food/supplies. . Died from lack of sailing experience.

And yet we can't bring ourselves to stop using this one particular type of oil.   Our fucking species is out of its collective mind.. Its easier for the big companies to continue what theyre doing. Most of the *we* youre speaking of doesnt even know what palm oil is or what its in.. Capitalism is the most ethical means of distributing wealth:. Not everything can be blamed on capitalism. If proper regulations and enforcement were put in place, this wouldn't be an issue. *Pure* capitalism is a problem, just like pure communism/socialism. Why haven't proper regulations been put in place already, before the orangutan population dropped by 100,000?. Because you're dealing with third world countries with corrupt governments that are not even capable of enforcing laws or regulations.

As a Canadian, I have to admit that this sentiment is one of the reasons that I can sleep well at night. It's nice to know that we have many, many more friends than we have enemies. . Can confirm being Canadian is pretty good. Sure we have problems here but I always feel safe. Canada is like a poor mans Switzerland.

Although I do love knowing that Switzerland had booby-trapped all mountain pass entrances and had caches of weapons hidden around the country in the event that anyone dared attack them.   . I like the sound of that. Canada needs some of those booby-traps. Maybe we already have some and don't know of them. We already have booby traps which also happen to be our WMDs. Potholes.

I think that's unnecessary.  You don't have to tell a bull what to do in a China shop, you just have to get him in there and he does what comes naturally.. Best metaphor. It would be if it wasn't in reference to the billionaire president of the richest nation in the world. He's not stupid - and the fact that people think he is...is terrifying.. He has yet to convince me that he is not stupid... I think you are giving him far too much credit.

It was fairly entertaining, but as a competition it was garbage with him basically telling the contestants to go sell lemonade on the streets of NYC every episode. .

Ergo, why is he ballooning the national debt with stupid tariffs? Sad. . Its not logical... the only explanation is that he's senile or doing it because someone in Moscow told him to.... this is hurting everyone, especially the Western Hemisphere. .

But I also learned that Mercantilism is right!. I also learned that I have no idea how trade works or how +2 to mercantilism affects me or what it even is. . The wiki has a good summary on the trade page. Mercantilism is a multiplier in the trade power algorithm.   Very powerful . That would be useful if I understood said algorithm. . You don't need to know the algorithm just know that more mercantilism = more trade power = more money = more gooder

Unemployment is at an 18 year low and the stock market is breaking records.  . The stock market is artificially conflated and serves a subset of the US population, not the economy as a whole.. The stock market serves everyone who has a retirement account. It is all invested in the stock market. 401ks, pensions, IRAs, everyone is in the stock market. .

Same with Obamacare and the Affordable Care Act. One carries a negative connotation that idiots grasp at, and the other doesn't. Idiots hear Global Warming and talk about all the snow they got. . Its an uneven playing field.  Statistics courses should be mandatory education so people can understand why anecdotal experiences (local weather in this case) are useless.. But they aren't and that's the world we live in, so we have to soften the conversation or we will be immediately shut out. You're right.

What is your source for the claim estimates that vary widely?. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/PaleoceneEocene_Thermal_Maximum  Hey look, a period when there was no Antarctic ice.

Nah there actually is a proper delete button, it takes around 7 days for it to be fully deleted.. And you trust Facebook to actually delete everything about you from their servers? That's a tad naive, when their revenue comes from selling your personal data.. I mean legally they have to delete it.  That doesn't stop them from selling it as hard as they can to as many of their partners as possible before its deleted though.. If they want to be dicks they could do something like sell the data to a subsidiary and then delete your info. That way they can still keep it while deleting it from FB itself.

t1_dup9ti4	0	*	In a rare example of breaking with diplomatic niceties, the PM of Denmark is publicly urging President Trump to respond to the outcry that has followed the latest mass shooting in the U.S. Lars Lokke Rasmussen said Trump needs to listen to the students demonstrating in support of tighter gun control. I thought we didn't like foreign governments interfering in our politics?. Literally nobody has said foreign governments cant have a public stance on our internal affairs.. It is actually unusual for friendly nations to comment directly on domestic policy. Trump has constantly commented on other nations affairs. Im sure he can take it. . The point.      Your head.. Actully I dont think the PM would have made that remark if it wasnt for Trump and the fact the he is so unpopular he can score some homepoints by doing this.

The issue with that is they'd need to be treated as actual prisoners, and perhaps even given trials. That's what the Republicans want to avoid doing. . > They could be housed in a supermax prison.  And they might well be more secure there - hosting a prison on foreign, potentially hostile soil is *not* the best idea for security.. That is, in fact, exactly how ISIS got started - in a US jail on foreign unstable soil.. This is intentionally dishonest.. Unintentionally dishonest, actually.

Trying to talk sense into a pug owner? Lol. Almost as bad as trying to talk sense to a pit owner.. Eh. Pits are fine. The difference between pugs and pits is that there are more pits that need love and adoption than any other dog. We need more pits owners tbh. .

I think as long as you fully understand there's as much chance of losing anything you put in as gaining it's OK. The problem is with people putting in more than they can afford to lose.

t1_dt9vaxw	1	*	German police sue American woman for slander for calling them 'Nazis'. Good. The fad of calling everybody who think different than you as Nazis needs to end. It completely trivializes Nazism. . So you don't believe in freedom of speech?   . > So you don't believe in freedom of speech?   You do know people can sue for slander in the US right?  . Calling someone names like Bastard and Nazi shouldn't be considered slanderous to the point where the person is sued and silenced. . That is for the court to decide, isn't it? . Usually you have to demonstrate harm for defamation. I think you'll find it extremely rare someone suffered for being called a bastard or a nazi. 
t1_dta1uh9	1	*	German police sue American woman for slander for calling them 'Nazis'. Police say the woman, a 49-year-old professor...  Hopefully not a history professor. . She's a political scientist I believe. Did some brilliant work on the Pakistani Army.. you need to put a /s to mark it as satire, otherwise we don't  get it.. Why would you assume its satire?. Because in the context of her ignorantly calling someone a nazi for a trivial reason despite her background would lead someone to believe her other work may be subpar. Yeah because her being a professor in something ending in studies makes her by definition subpar. And her book? Even a broken clock is right twice a day.

I know this might surprise you, but a lot of people in Pakistan don't like the Taliban (i.e. the people we're dropping bombs on).. Perhaps.   But we all know that finding some people with colourful opinions is not a sound basis for assessment foreign policy thesis.  . So you're in favor of not opposing the Taliban?  Because that is the other option.
t1_dtaled2	0	*	German police sue American woman for slander for calling them 'Nazis'. No freedom of speech in Europe lol. More like no tolerance for ignorant cunts . Call it whatever you want but you still cant speak freely . She can speak freely, she is just subject to any repercussions for what she said. She chose something where the repercussions are pretty harsh. That's it.. That's like saying you can murder freely, you'll just face repercussions from the justice system for doing it. The repercussions are what make the thing not free to do.. Actually that is EXACTLY what I am saying.

If we use a rapid airborne delivery of a tranquilizer,  we can sedate the entire school. . The Russians tried a gas attack: it killed 133 hostages and 40 terrorists (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_theater_hostage_crisis).  . Well we can afford better gas than the Red's, right?.

I hate to break the anti-circlejerk, but what about all those doctors and lawyers that still have that student debt well into their lucrative careers. .

The debt still follows them and can cripple them, I mean partly because they typically will buy a house or buy high rent also, but yea it can be very difficult..

The Jewish state is actually a new Nazi state. No anti-semitism in sight, tho. Carry on.. Hows that even antisemitism? He said Israel should complain if they build settlements in another country, which they do not.. He compared Israeli settlements in the Westbank to the Nazis occupying Poland. How the fuck is that not equating the Jewish state with the Nazis?. He didn't mention the word nazi once. He said if Germany occupies one of its neighbors the way Israel does, then Israel would have the right to complain.

Most countries have similar policies. I know Canada, Aus, NZ, US and the UK do.. Again as above, consequences are for  little people. G7 countries can do whatever.

After Germany surrendered the US actually heavily invested in rebuilding the country. In Afghanistan we gave up on trying to improve the country but didn't give up on bombing them.. hard to help a country who wont put in the effort to be better, yet its all due to US being a giant douche since the 80s to them. Maybe we should take the hint and bring the troops home.. we tried that.

Funny because, if I recall correctly, McMaster was the one everyone was super excited about joining Trump's cabinet. . Maybe the national security advisor knows more about foreign policy than you do. Just a guess.. Or maybe he's just a neocon aka an imbecile. You do realize Obama and Clinton pushed a neo-con foreign policy?

Yeah not the words by any means, we past that barrier with grab em by the pussy, I'm referring to calling other countries shit holes, not exactly great for international relations. You indicated he's trying to get impeached.  I'm saying, that's absurd.. All of what he has said has been the exact opposite of what most would be considered presidential  Fuck it, I'm probably wrong, I just wish he'd hop off Twitter for a while and lead instead of divide . I think the those on the left continually inserting race, feminism, etc into every topic is equally divisive. Not that he isn't, just you only ever hear that accusation thrown at him.

To be fair, the ME didn't have a very peaceful/loving record even before the coalition or Russian intervened. Not sure why we though we could change that though... They did have a better record than Europe did until we started redrawing borders and setting up colonies / puppet governments there, to be fair. . Colonization didn't help, but it was the mongols that ended their golden age and caused them to retreat into religious fundamentalism.. Yes, let's blame something that happened centuries ago instead of what is in front of us happening right now.. History is a thing you know.

Having read this I can conclude that our ancestors were fucking idiots, or maybe just idiots fucking.. I find it hilarious that it hasn't occurred to you that our descendants will likely think the same of us.. I think the learning curve has evened out by now. Unless we reach an apocalyptic, fallout style disaster the previous generations will forever appear primitive to the current ones.. wishful thinking. The apocalypse or the fact that we will be viewed as primitive even 20 or 30 years from now?  Because one is going to happen regardless of how wishful you think.

This doesn't come anywhere close to offsetting the negative consequences of his actions. Source?. https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/03/how-trump-is-changing-science-environment/   response to the source?  Or does data scare you?  Just downvoted huh? no response, figured..

Yeah, it kind of proves the republican point that stuff like this doesnt need government funding since volunteers and the private sector will take care of it if there is a big enough need.. Darn, those damn Republicans were right about something fuck how can we oppose the next Republican idea or value.. Republicans destroy something, volunteers restore less than 1%, see? who needs the government! . Kind of like the riots by liberals that destroyed people's livelihoods after Trump won the election?

But it do. [I know Im gone get got, but Im gon get mine more than they get theres tho](https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/video-marshawn-lynch-asked-what-beast-mode-is-gives-great-answer/) . My heada gonna get got by vocabulary. . Oakland, baby
t1_dugrq4u	1	*	Top U.S. officials tell the world to ignore Trumps tweets. Member of the world here. LOL no. You made him the president, and I will absolutely judge what he says in a globally-public forum.. I mean, some of us tried to not let him be our president.  We just got outvoted.  edit:  he won with votes people.  I don't care if they're electoral or popular.. We actually won by three million votes. I think it's important to always point that out.  Edit: Holy crap. I either struck a nerve or the Russians are online in full force tonight.  SAD!. Then campaign to change your system.. Except the ones getting elected are the ones that get to change the system, so they just make it more difficult for others to get in. There's no way around it. . Yup, it's fucked.

Mexicano aqui: We were all rooting for Tio Bernie. . lol yah why bother fixing your own country.. root for open borders!. You're a loud one, aren't ya? . Just saying.... We wouldn't be in this situation if Mexico got their shit together. Lmfao. Are you really blaming Mexico for your problems?
t1_dugyguw	1	*	Top U.S. officials tell the world to ignore Trumps tweets. Wasn't it confirmed just roughly half a year ago that Trump's tweets are offical presidential statements?. Yes. Spicer said they were in June of 2017 during a press briefing.. I miss old spicey. He may have been incompetent and a cog in a corrupt system but at least he provided some relief to the monotony of this stupid administration. [Just a reminder that this gif exists](https://i.imgur.com/A1izvrj.mp4). Omg I remember this. You barely notice it at the start and then it dawns on you. Notice what?  Looks perfectly normal to me the entire way through.  Wow how I miss that guy and how he was so.. uhh... un-Huckabee like.
t1_dugr5tk	1	*	Top U.S. officials tell the world to ignore Trumps tweets. Probably should just ignore america in general for a while . But you guys are so loud.. Unfollow and mute.. Did you know Trump's tweets make international news headlines daily? SAD.. Then news stations should unfollow and mute.. But we need to keep track of the threats of nuclear war...you know, for reasons.

Right and the swing states were even closer like 70,000 votes either way. Just goes to show how small a number of voters russia had to manipulate to swing the election. That is an excellent point :)
t1_duh5kls	1	*	Top U.S. officials tell the world to ignore Trumps tweets. Sounds like sedition to me..  . > conduct or speech inciting people to rebel against the authority of a state or monarch  Ehhh... no.. I guess the technicality that would moot this would be the qualifier that we be at war.    But again,  we are technically at war with NK so...  . They're not inciting US citizens to rebel, they're trying to limit the damage being done to the interests of the people of the United States.. 1.) what damage?  2.) that's irrelevant anyways.   Suggested reading,  the espionage act . Lol!
t1_dugzs0x	1	*	Top U.S. officials tell the world to ignore Trumps tweets. Now Trump is really the crazy old uncle   *Ignore Uncle Trump here, he's getting a little senile .....*. He's old enough to be my grandfather, and I have kids. He's 71 for fuck's sake.. Not all who wander are lost. Not all who are aged are feeble. Not all presidents are awake.. Aragorn became king at ~88, but he was also part elf and part god. I doubt Trump can say the same.. He's orange, i doubt Aragorn can say the same. https://imgur.com/a/uRxqK

And change your voting system to something other than first past the post while youre at it . Yeah, that's my point. FPTP tends towards a 2-party system.
t1_duhe7z5	0	*	Top U.S. officials tell the world to ignore Trumps tweets. We were ignoring his tweets before he became the president of USA.  Then you guys made him your president.. 3 million more of us tried not to let this happen.   Edit: Seems I have pissed off some Trumpets and Russians. Sorry comrades. . And yet he's president. Your system *might* be flawed.. One of the 3 million checking in. We're (I am)  *keenly* aware of the flawed system, tyvm.. Small point of clarification, but you (and I, high five) are one of the 65.8 million who voted for Clinton.  Nobody is individually part of the 3 million.. Real question is if they initially voted for Bernie cos he was the only chance at an improving the country from the list

And yet there is never a candidate/politician who proposes to kill the system and make it like any normal democracy should be.. The system is only flawed when it doesn't work in their favor.
t1_dtun4u9	0	*	Tesla's massive 100MW South Australian battery is putting a big dent in 'gas cartel' profits.. Tesla needs to kick the failing automotive sector to the curb and focus its energy on electrical infrastructure. That's where the real money is at. . why not both? use the energy money to fund his cars.  that way we have two streams of reducing emissions/flacid fuel. It would be better if they sold components such as batteries to companies like Ford and Chrysler. . while true, i believe more competition is better for the consumer in the long run. There's already plenty of competition in the automotive sector.  . And how is more worse? I don't see a point to your argument
t1_dt29hhw	0	*	Whistleblower claims accountants turned a blind eye to Dubai firm he says painted 5 tons of gold to look like silver. wait, gold is almost twice the weight of silver. you think  someone in the loading docks would be like your looking a little short on volume there fella. ~~It would be more volume~~   Edit: i thought they painted silver gold. My mistake. I will leave my shame up for the world to see.. if you had two 5 ton piles, one of silver, and one of gold painted silver, the gold painted silver pile would be smaller, not bigger.. ~~Which is exactly why they would upon seeing your silver painted gold, say that you were had too much volume, not less. Stable genius, you are~~. I think Ibsi204s logic is correct. Unless Im also retarded. No, hes right Im fucking retarded.
t1_dtlneml	1	*	Chinese Navy ship reportedly spotted with a deadly electromagnetic railgun fitted.. On a scale from dead to really super dead, how much deadlier is this from the usual giant boom sticks?. Railgun ammunition usually contain no explosives, they usually solely rely on their kinetic energy. These rounds can tear through the hull of ships.. Which isn't necessarily that useful, as ships are designed to stay afloat with some holes in.. Rose and Jack have something to tell you.. Uh, actually, I think it's just Rose.... Spoilers!!!!
t1_dud1alx	0	*	Japan, the United States and the European Union are considering jointly filing a case against China at the World Trade Organization over Chinese rules that effectively force foreign companies to transfer technologies to domestic firms, The Yomiuri Shimbun has learned.. ELI5?. When a foreign country wants to sell their products in China they are often forced to partner with a local company and give up their intellectual property.. >When a foreign country wants to sell their products in China they are often forced to partner with a local company and ~~give up their intellectual property.~~ allow their IP to be stolen.  Fixed  . It's not stolen if consent was given.. Coerced consent is not consent, and China's trade rules are definitely coercion.. They're not coerced. Don't like the rules? Then don't do business in China. China isn't forcing businesses to set up shop in China.
