Hes giving others a warning to stay away.  Its no different than drug addicts telling people to stay away or inmates scaring people straight.  Now if hes condemning and vilifying people that is hypocrisy.

Hence, the changes in US politics might not be reflected in the corruption perception  - Similar concerns apply to other countries, such as Malta, which was shaken by multiple different corruption cases only later on 2017  - To see the full Trump effect, we have to wait for CPI of 2018	0.0	1.0

t1_dudulil	Pharmacist here: when I get rxs for this most insurances don't cover because of the price so I end telling patients to get the over the counter equivalents/change med with MD approval. When it is covered by the insurance I assure you the insurance isn't dumb enough to pay anything close to that price. Think of that price as msrp. Insurance usually have contracts with manufacturers to pay well below that sticker price. That's why sometimes insurance will actually only cover the brand, ex: Adderall. Now systemically the cost of drugs is high is because in instances where patients have no choice but to get a med (i.e.: cancer meds) your insurance has no power to negotiate on your behalf because it such a small player compared to the manufacturer.

From that moment on, this 14 year olds outlook on war changed.  Also he ate a teeth cleaning chew for my mom's poodle thinking it was beef jerky.  Apparently they are insane crazy about beef jerky.  He also could not comprehend that we had a front and backyard of some 3 acres.  Then when we showed him our farm of 180acres his mind was blown.  One morning we woke up to him driving the farm truck around the backyard and he nearly crashed it into the house.  All in all though it was a great experience.

With a deal of 1 additional billion at the end of last year and With the new deal they just signed worth an extra 500 milllion and a 10% raise over 3 years. What does that come up to?

I want an answer.  Edit:  Who said having premarital sex was more halal than eating pork?  There are so many men who look at pork like it is disgusting, but drink and have premarital sex like theres nothing wrong with it.  A woman can not speak her mind.

Basically, there's two stories that people often get mixed up (intentionally or otherwise).  - Russian groups tried to push various stories, mostly via social media, during and after the election. This included anti-Clinton rhetoric (mostly before the election), as well as anti-Trump rhetoric (mostly after the election). - Trump colluded with the Russian Government to help himself get elected.  The first is the story that's had recent evidence added to the pile. Trump has never denied this one. The later is a conspiracy theory.

t1_dugfja1	Not true. We're still technically in the current ice age, in which there have been a number of interglacial periods just as precipitous if not more so (and warmer) than this one. Cold trends can also be abrupt. See below.  https://geology.utah.gov/map-pub/survey-notes/glad-you-asked/ice-ages-what-are-they-and-what-causes-them/  For example, as Earth was emerging out of the last glacial cycle, the warming trend was interrupted 12,800 years ago when temperatures dropped dramatically in only several decades. A mere 1,300 years later, temperatures locally spiked as much as 20xb0F (11xb0C) within just several years. Sudden changes like this occurred at least 24 times during the past 100,000 years.

Busses woudl pick up tank crews from factories, run them through warehouses in which they dressed and kitted, and the tanks would be waiting, armed, warm and fuelled, ready to go as they ran out of the warehouse.   It also gave an interesting insight into the Communist economic system. Commanders would grab whatever was available - boots, say - and swap them for other things that they needed with neighbouring commands. This led to enormous quantities of spares, obsolete equipment and decaying rations sitting in storage. Come Gulf War I, Germany was able to ship the whole lot off to Iraq as its contribution.

Fossil fuels which is used to power machines and trucks that transport massive amounts of foods from factories that are also powered by fossil fuels so billions of people can be fed.

Diesel is needed by trucks in order to transport food to grocery stores and PlayStation 4 and video games to retail shops.    If there is a straight up mandatory order to stop fossil fuel usage, then what's gonna power their factories to mass-produce food to feed billions of people? There will be nothing and as a result, there will be famine worldwide. But before that'll happen, billions of people will pillage the nearby stores, towns, people's homes, cities, and eventually nations in order to cling onto survival. 	0.0	1.0

Apartheid may be long dead, but the fruits reaped from it still exist and in disproportionate control of white colonials, many of whom only exist because native Africans were driven off that land and forcefully relocated into hellish ghettos.   So apartheid is gone, but what to do with all the land and resources it gave exclusively to white settlers for the benefit of exclusively white farmers and by extension white society? Should whites continue to dominate these resources or should redistribution be done? What was the point of getting rid of apartheid if all the consequences of it are allowed to persist? 	0.0	1.0

The story goes on both in Hiroshima and nearby port city.  English voice acting was a bit low quality i find, but the story is so good that you'll soon forget all about it as time goes. Especially later in the movie, i think the voice actors finally kinda let loose, had to really... very affecting stuff.  There's also a movie called Grave of the Fireflies about the (said to be much more devestating) fire bombings that went on before the big bombs. Havent seen it yet but... I know what i'm in for.  You see a bit of the firebombing in In this Corner of the World.  If you think about it, japan's buildings back then were like... mostly paper, wood, and stone.

Both are true, even Facebook admitted that the ads came mostly after the election and didn't help Trump win at all.

I'm guessing the government is hoping to put some lipstick on this pig by trying to force the farmers to give up their land without the use of force.

I think we need to judge by per rider subsidies and actual reductions in carbon emissions instead of looking at the outside shininess of new infrastructure.

Ultimately, a lot of the seemingly impossible facets of Japanese society (ie. stellar service) work because the large majority of people were raised under it or raised under something similarly and are expected to follow the societal norms.  Most refugees I imagine have no real way to access the information needed to learn these norms or the Japanese language. English is a lot more accessible for them (looking up an english word is way easier than looking up Kanji,) and Japan has a right to be homogenous despite the legal contract theyre breaking.

A bit of context: We are expats living in Bangkok. Almost every local who can afford it, will go for a c-section here and for the vast majority of hospitals this is very good business (higher revenue than natural birth, faster turnaround, easier to schedule).  Two weeks before our due date our ObGyn was fired by her hospital (internal politics and stuff) and we transferred with her to another private hospital.   The day of the delivery came and we had a great birth which took a lot longer than expected but went altogether great, mainly because our doctor gave us a lot of time and did not rush things at all.  One week later we hear that she did receive some flak from the department head for not pushing us for a c-section.  Unbelievable.  Edit: Typo	0.0	1.0

The term disappeared until the 1950's when it was used as a code for Jew on account of the sudden unpopularity of anti-Semitism, the reference to the Jews being based on their relative slowness to adopt age of consent to marry laws that had permeated the United States.  The idea of associating pedophilia with Semitic and East Asian peoples generally have always followed in accordance with the cultural prejudices of the Anglosphere from one decade to the next; the Muslims became pedophiles during the War on Terror, the Japanese became pedophiles when their television programs gained higher ratings than the boring shit that filled the airwaves; but the Jews have gotten the label more regularly than all of them... except for Jeffery Epstein, who regularly supplied adolescent prostitutes to his wealthy Christian clients.	0.0	1.0

I'm not saying he wasn't corrupt, but like Bo Xilai, in the highest levels these things only come out if you lose a political fight.   It was rumoured that Zhou summoned the Wu Jing (armed police) for a coup on the current leadership (Xi et al.). The Wu Jing are in the process of being disbanded.

Furthermore, China has made it clear that they consider it acceptable for countries (like North Korea) to break long-standing international norms and treaties (like bans on nuclear weapons development) so long as it serves their strategic needs.   If the US is smart, a warmer, closer relationship with Taiwan should emerge, and the US could provide weapons that would make an invasion of Taiwan a very costly proposition for mainland China.	0.0	1.0

Areas around Harrogate and Craven were also particularly treacherous, according to North Yorkshire Police.  The Met Office said several centimetres of snow had fallen in some parts over the night  with 1cm in Kent by 5am, and between 3cm and 4cm in Newcastle and Northumberland.  Heavy showers were expected to continue throughout the morning and cripple much of the countrys travel network.

That was my wife's experience with labor, she was laughing and smiling through the whole thing. My son is completely healthy and wife's only pain was coughing post surgery for a couple days.  Personally I'm really glad that she didn't have to go through the agony of childbirth. Modern medicine is amazing.	0.0	1.0

Edit on why it's not a pro-Putin video, but a pro-Putin video: it tries to feed into some fears of people to urge them *vote*, it's a direct response to protests and other parties rallying to boycott the elections entirely, because voting instead of boycotting allows to falsify easier.	0.0	1.0

From 2016 onwards the federal government will be forbidden to run a structural deficit of more than 0.35% of GDP. From 2020, the states will not be permitted to run any structural deficit at all.[5][6][7] The Basic Law permits an exception to be made for emergencies such as a natural disaster or severe economic crisis.	0.0	1.0

t1_dunwddv	My take on this: The Palestinian did charge at the soldiers with a weapon and intent to harm, so they responded with defense. Yes they did step over the line when they were safe and continued to harm the assailant. Yes the Palestinians routinely commit terror attacks on Israelis including soldiers. Yes the Israeli military often launches offensive missions to counter terrorism. Yes collateral damage occurs on both ends. No it isn't apartheid. This is just the symptom of living together in a contested area where people clearly aren't getting along. One side lived there for a long time then was kicked out, the other had a few migrate then the rest invaded and settled for a long time before the other side came back. It's a mess, it's complex.

t1_duwdcap	Flew to Stockholm last night. The airport is best described as chaotic. People's unclaimed baggage were spread around the airport, dumped from the belts and shoved into a pile in the corners to make room for the next batches.

They could only manage 1 plane every 45 minutes or so too, so scores of people were all hugging the belts thinking that would get their suitcases faster.

For those not in the know in the US you CANNOT purchase a firearm over the internet and have it shipped to your home. The process is you purchase the firearm from the seller pay them then the seller ships it to a local FFL dealer in your area. And dennnnn the FFL charges you between $10-$25 for the transfer and NICS background check. After all the paperwork and background check is finished only then can the dealer give you your purchase and you be on your merry way. Buying them any other way is a federal offence and will get you and the seller 10 years in the pokey.  Bought a Mosin,Garand and Enfield in this fashion.

t1_ducay01	We need policy defined Immediately following birth too. When my partner had a C-section birth the nurses attending started to ask me to leave immediately with my newborn daughter in my arms, so I could take her to a heated cot when there were no complications during the whole procedure.  The absolute best place for her was in skin to skin contact with her mother, and that was the best thing for the mother too to lessen the trauma following the operation.  The weeks following were a mess too. My partner developed an infection and required a hospital visit for IV antibiotics. As she was breastfeeding the baby has to be there, but the doctor insisted the baby be kept separate from the mother during the course of the treatment.  This would have exposed my daughter to additional risk as she was reliant on antibodies from her mum's breast milk, potentially disrupted milk production, and opened up the chance of post natal depression.	0.0	1.0

The president of Nigeria, Buhari, has been paying millions of euros to these terrorists to effect batch releases. At the same time, the govt has been releasing choice boko haram commanders.  This has created a butterfly effect of a racket where Boko haram have guaranteed finances and release of captured fighters when they kidnap, especially school girls. There has been a strong correlation between the payment of ransome and release of BH commanders with the upsurge in attacks.  Whether by malice or ignorance, the govt of Nigeria is strengthening this scourge.	0.0	1.0

t1_duuitl8	Criticism alone has never changed anything. People mumble and moan for a while and then accept whatever is being shown down their throats. The only thing that those in power understand is immediate and concrete action that actually influences the situation. And when people have almost no power all they can do is riot and wreck as much chaos as possible. And if that changes nothing then violence towards those in power is the only way to go, but people are reluctant to commit to violence and risk their lives in the process. And thus nothing ever happens until people have no other choice. Revolutions are paved in blood and after all that the cycle starts a new.

t1_dul4ugu	I am all about remembering the Jewish victims of the holocaust, but I distrust the motives of people who always insist on putting other victims first, because I think the reason they do so is not out of care/love/sympathy for the others, but out of anti-semitism, to minimize the Jewish holocaust. If it is about remembering your loved ones, fine. Good.  One the other side, the Jewish response to this particular story is quite distasteful, though I can understand why they are so... hysterical about it. People have wanted to holocaust the Jews for many centuries (look at the book of Esther), and they will want to do so in the future, sadly. Nonetheless, I think that at least a bit of the Jewish hysteria over anti-semitism actively contributes to anti-semitism. How would a polish person feel if a Jew wanted to deny their holocaust?  All told, this is a vicious circle with a repeating tragedy that will never be broken. 	0.0	1.0

You called upon the crowd to be saved by God, through your words. I stood there and sunk into the role of observer. I wondered what I was missing, everyone else seemed to be a part of this idea that I couldn't understand. I felt like an outsider, alone on an island of individual consciousness desperately trying to connect.   Years of reflection after that night led me to where I am today. Seeing those people desperate for connection, love and acceptance made me realize that I needed to find those things within people, not ideas. I hope the effect you had on people was more positive than negative. Regardless of your intention, your effect on me was certainly for the good.  	0.0	1.0

You can imagine a drug that reduces symptoms by a fraction of a percent, but you would need thousands of individuals to reliably detect this.

t1_dufjpjm	True, but Democracy is not a natural state for humans. It's kind of like communism on a state level, because if Democracy is not unanimously seen as a higher value, and there are some anti-democratic elements within society, then it will fail.  If extremists and inciters are given a platform, eventually people will follow, or their ideas will at least get some gradually growing degree of legitimacy.   For this to happen, a democracy needs to have some undemocratic laws. Ban one's free speech to protect others.  If we look at ISIS, for example, they were very successful for a while because they made smart use of social media, and those media outlets, by request of democratic states, removed their pages and banned their right for free speech. It was undemocratic. But it safeguarded the values of democratic nations.   So complete support for democracy is not the right way to go. Rules for exceptions must be made.	0.0	1.0

We wouldn't have to file tax returns at all, because no one cares where your money is coming from as long as all the taxes are coming out when you buy something.

t1_duv6qo9	Police officer here. The government has changed the standard of how police record rape. Previously charging standards (standard required to get the case taken on by CPS -prosecutors) were applied by many old sweat detectives. This was resulting in rapes being turned into lesser offences. Now any mention of rape is recorded as a rape or a variant of rape. This includes where the rape is an impossibility e.g. a ghost raped me. Therefore part of the increase will be attributable to this. However no one wants to openly criticise this change. Extream repeat callers e.g. those with mental health issues can ring in 2/3 rapes a day. Previously this could be closed off. Now all would be recorded.   TLDR The way rape is recorded has changed. 	0.0	1.0

And then the other side says: this is fine, nothing to see here. The situation is far more nuanced than boiling it down to simpleton rhetoric. This exact scenario did not happen in a vacuum and is a direct result of a year of rampant violence. These police were displaying classic paranoid behavior and because of that severely crossed the line. They did so however, because there were thousands of stabbings last year committed against police. 	0.0	1.0

I'm no scientist or historian, but I can see how this would be nearly impossible to detect in say 1850. Maybe I'm wrong, but that's why I'm asking I guess.  There's a moral to my question too. I don't think you can place blame or fault.

t1_duumqu8	I once heard an extensive discussion on the radio about a woman who had a really fascinating and scary brain disease/disorder. It's an auto-immune disorder/disease called anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, in which the body attacks its own brain, and it causes all the symptoms of what has historically been called/presented as demonic possession...including that she has no memory of it. Even something as apparently complicated and supernatural as possession can be explained with the scientific study of reality, and the expanded human understanding of facts.  Here's the NPR page with the audio story linked at the top, and some exerpts from the interview/report. The audio is about 40 minutes long. http://www.npr.org/2012/11/14/165115921/a-young-reporter-chronicles-her-brain-on-fire  She has written a book about the whole experience (pieced together from interviewing people about what happened to her in her absence), and it has gotten good reviews: http://www.npr.org/2012/11/14/164400198/brain-on-fire-details-an-out-of-mind-experience	0.0	1.0

Clearly that happens. (And not just with Russia athletes. Plenty of American athletes have used performance enhancing drugs.)  But if these Russian athletes have been subject to a honest testing program and tested clean, I can't see penalizing them for something they had no part of.  These are people's dreams.

t1_dui7kvl	Taxes are great right up until you realize that social programs in a capitalist economy deprive workers of agency and opportunity.  This isn't to say that we should abandon taxes or social programs in a fit of Randian ineptitude, but rather to call into question why all these incredibly rich people are calling for higher taxes.  Despite the seemingly-benevolent nature of the statements, I believe it is motivated by the desire to keep working people complacent and uncompetitive.  Rather than pay laborers their due, these people just want another avenue of control over the masses.  After all, who's going to get contracted to fulfill all the social programs that these taxes would pay for?  If the average laborer were instead to see more of the value that they produce, that would risk them accumulating enough capital and influence to make their own businesses, thus increasing competition and headaches for the people who already own so much.  Can't have that, so it's taxes, social programs, and UBI for these neo-feudalists.	0.0	1.0

On one hand the anti-gay rhetoric coming from the Kremlin certainly unleashed a very frightening violence against gay people in Russia, but at the same time it was a little bit of a diversion tactic in order to really clam down on political dissent that was threatening Putin's rule.  https://www.revealnews.org/episodes/russias-new-scapegoats/	0.0	1.0

Now, the balance of technology favours the owners hard, and they've realised that they don't need to pay anything like the freedoms they bought us with. Thus, they are adjusting their offer, and using new technologies trade expensive carrots for cheaper sticks.  Should the balance of technology make carrots cheaper than sticks once more, then we can expect to see this trend invert; but never doubt that it is **utterly** beyond your control, unless you can seize an advantage they missed and join their ranks.

Everything is surrounded by walls and on these walls are cameras and beside these walls are military personnel and on the sidewalk are police officers dressed in normal clothes im told.

It would be one thing to have murdered the perpetrator but to kill someone completely unrelated because they share the same skin colour is extremely ridiculous and disgusting.      i would however respect them more if they joined the kurds fighting ISIS.

This would stand for other examples too, such as refusing to shake hands with a black person.    We are well served by peoples anger at this. I would add, however, that speaking rights at a marae is problematic for identical reasons. Frankly, if you're opposed to the Iranian actions here you should also be opposed to providing different speaking rights to women on the marae.    I am, enthusiastically, in favour of the power of reason to erode tradition, custom, and culture where it is found to be unjust. However, this must be done coherently with appropriate application to all cultures,  religions, and so on. Sexism(/racism/ect) doesn't get a pass in the marae or in the mosque. I ask those who are, quite rightly, angered at the Iranians here to extend that to all acts of discrimination. 	0.0	1.0

t1_duugj7j	The really disturbing thing about Russia's tactics these past few years is the apparent unwillingness of Western governments to actually do anything about it.

We've all happily held elections during times of obvious foreign interference for example - as if there's nothing that can be done, some governments even went to great lengths to publicly ignore the issue and presumably not act on what their intelligence services have been telling them.

t1_dupb3gl	Placing Trump in the same list as any of the others under the title of human rights violators is laughable and an insult to many of the citizens of nations actually suppressed by their leaders. When looking at each leaders human rights violations as presented in their statement, no caparison can be made between trump and the rest and all Amnesty ( a humanitarian group I had previously believed to be impartial) has done, is to normalise the genuine human rights violations commited by el-Sisi, Duterte, Maduro, Putin, and Xi. Compared to deadly government enforced starvation such as those occurring in Venezuela or North Korea or Putins control of electoral results through a violent government, Trumps temporary travel ban, or the completely legal securing of the Mexico border don't even approach the other leaders violations of rights. Seeing this willingness to normalise actual humanitarian rights violations by comparing them to the U.S where people are afforded more freedoms than any other nation mentioned is therefore quite disheartening 	0.0	1.0

Rule of thumb: if rates of a crime literally more than DOUBLE in a year, and there are no MASSIVE changes such as civil war or economic collapse, then the increase is due to a change in enforcement policy or reporting.  *Hopefully* most of the increase was simply because of improvements in reporting rates, and improvements in the government prosecuting idiots for nonconsensually shared photos/video of other people.

I guess if after the insurance pays and it makes no difference to the customer, so they don't care, that docs may continue to prescribe it because they don't care and the only people who lose are everyone by having higher insurance premiums in the USA? But then why would the drug company be willing to shell out? Better they charge you the same and you take something that saves them money.   Also $138 is already pretty pricey for such a drug. In Australia, a non-PBS script for Esomeprazole can be had for $13.99, and Naproxen for $10.50. AFAIK the combination isn't available here.  	0.0	1.0

To the extent of my knowledge, oxycodone is worth about 1$/mg on the street.  If you make the modest investment in a pill press and buy custom dies from china to replicate oxycodone pills, you're looking at turning a few thousand dollars into millions.  I know the OP isn't specifically about opioids, but restricting their use (as well as other, non-opioid painkillers) as effective pain killers will drive people into seedier markets with less product control and reliability.

We walked around the property for twenty minutes, lifting every rock we found, and almost all of them were completely empty beneath. We found about six insects in that time. I was blown away.

I understand the desperation of parents to find solutions, but those solutions need to have good research. Remember that even 15 years ago, this was all bad parenting. The people who decide what constitutes autism just fundamentally changed its definition in 2013!  Also, as a parent of a person on the spectrum, please, before you go too far with ABA, research it from the perspective of adults on the spectrum who received it.

t1_duwyovh	It is called weather. Polar air mass moving into other regions is actually pretty common. Yes, this year has been worse in this way, but global temperature is not elevated compared to recent years. At +.26c January is actually one of the coldest months globally(we won't know Feb until it is over) in the last 3 years.  You will hear about it because it causes the arctic ice extent to be smaller and really nasty weather in North America(east mostly) and Eurasia. You won't hear about it when the global trend is opposite, even though the global temperature is exactly the same. This happened in 2012 to almost the same severity, and then the next year we had mild continental temperatures and a recovered ice sheet.  What we should be studying/worrying about is the long term trend. The arctic is warming about 2.5 times as fast as the rest of the globe, C02 forcing alone cannot cause this effect. We need to figure out what is precisely happening, and if it is human caused what we can do to alter the current trajectory.	0.0	1.0

t1_durbpzz	It's sad to think if it was necessary to use such a weapon. Japan proved itself a formidable foe in war that does not have surrender in their language (figuratively speaking). It breaks my heart that science has to think this way when science seems like our only hope to unite with each other and forget there is something much bigger than our petty and unessesary hatred.   I like to remind myself that this is just war. Never forget the atrocities it brings.   Edit: It's controversial I know to say things like necessary but if the US didn't use it, how would the outcome of the war have gone? Another 2 million soldier deaths from both sides? A change in history today? All I really said it is sad science was used for bad and that war is bad. Science has brought us smart phones,  the internet, travel, it has brought closer and closer. Without war,  science wouldn't have to be used to make weapons like nukes. 	0.0	1.0

t1_duf6lxi	The issue is, people think because Russia wanted Trump to win it means there is collusion. It doesn't. Hilary wanted to make anti-fly zones over Syria, which Russia almost certainly would have been basically forced to break, meaning America would have shot down Russian planes, which almost certainly would have led to an escalation of tensions not seen since the end of the Cold War.     Legit, if I was Russia, I'd want Trump to win. Not because he is less competent than Hilary, but because he's less of a war-mongering psychopath. Never forget, Bill Clinton is the reason the Democrats 1) support the military industrial complex. and 2) support Wall Street over middle/lower class American citizens.

Ok, I get that.  But then using that same logic, if a handgun is sufficient for defence, wouldnt it be pertinent to ban the assault weapons anyway as its likely overkill.  Its worked here in Australia. We still have as many (more actually) guns as we had before our gun control legislation, but theyre lower capacity weapons and big surprise when you reduce the number of bullets people can fire, you reduce the number of potential casualties. Thats why weve had no mass shootings since they were enacted over 20years ago when we had 13 in the 18 years prior to them becoming law.  I just dont get the logic in trying to raise the stakes in the hopes that it might fix a worsening situation.	0.0	1.0

Luckily for Bush and Cheney, nowhere friendly with us upholds international law. Also, can't bring this up without pointing out that, the US government literally passed a law in the US (The Hague Invasion Act, aka American Service-Members Protection Act) which says that in a case like that where an American politician was tried for or charged with war crimes by the International Criminal Court, it would be legal (in US law, obviously not internationally) for us to send a military invasion force to prevent them from being jailed...	0.0	1.0

But, then, the following week, without the common evil causing them to band together, the group of remaining girls starts to get catty and turn on each other.

t1_dudupm6	The article briefly touched on this point but it bears repeating:  These prices aren't intended for the average consumer. They're wholesale pricing that gets heavily rebates depending on purchase volume by the pharmacies and hospitals.  Drug makers hike up the prices to incentivize hospitals to make greater bulk purchases to achieve a significant rebate.  The system is broken. This isn't meant for you or me to pay $2k for the bottle.  But as also stated in the article, I think a large contributor to the inflated pricing in American Healthcare is the lack of transparency. People can't comparison shop the way they would on Amazon for a simple consumer good.	0.0	1.0

In reality I found Religious studies took a very neutral view on a variety of faiths. I found it very interesting to really understand the difference between Catholics and Protestants and the history of Islam, Judaism and Buddhism among others.	0.0	1.0

t1_duldpqa	It's not as bad as you might think, the reason why it's referred to peak is because it's all going downhill from that year forward due to international laws. The only reason why oil's being used as a stepping stone for other countries to gain access to electricity is because of it's cheap - and until we're able to produce clean technology without relying on oil, they're simply going to be profiting from people's technological growth until that time. There's a small chance that the peak will happen sooner than later because people have been working on growing fuel, instead of drilling for it. So thank you scientists that actually give a crap about our future. No thanks to you, BP.

Why not institute a law where people of colour have to do a 5 year land management and farming apprenticeship on said land before the land is handed over? Ensuring Zim 2.0 doesn't happen? Nope not even this stupid law I'm proposing was remotely considered in any shape or form, opting the easy black/white cut route of just expropriating the land... Such a shame such a country with so much potential is being held back by greed/retaliation. There are ways to go about retribution but this short term retaliatory thinking is gonna reer it's ugly head with famine and strife. The whites with their GPS coordinated john Deere tech managed farms are gonna be asked to come back and fix everything...

t1_dubmwho	When I learned the shooters name yesterday I hoped on twitter to see if I could scan for an account to glean some information about this murderer.

A liberal  Hundreds perhaps thousands of tweets in almost no time, once the name was released. I quickly became overcome by dread and fled the site.  Today we learn that its completely not the case. He is a Maga-head with links to white supremacy. I still havent learned where if he was born in US or not.   Shocking.

I suppose we will find out. I'm the same as all of you. my income is reliant on the fact that we do pollute. that we do continue in the state of mind we have created for ourselves. so what does it take to cause the necessary change?

Bearing in mind that plenty people do work very hard and earn very little.

Same in China now. Censorship of news and people in Germany, same in China now. No google, no FB, youtube, everything is monitored in the online chatting, Weibo(Chinese twitter), Wechat(Chinese what's app). The news agency said that's want Chinese people want, but I believe that's what he wants. We are not North Korean, we can't and don't want it. What's next ?

Nearly half saw a marked reduction in the core symptoms of autism, and nearly a third said their children either started speaking for the first time or were communicating nonverbally. One child said, I love you, Momfor the first time in his life.  As for Benjamin, within two weeks of filling the prescription from Aran, Sharon says, he was calmer. He responded when she spoke to him. He could sit still and make eye contact. If she took him with her to visit friends, she could sit with the adults drinking tea while he played quietly in the other room. Within months, he was doing so well that his teachers recommended he leave his special-needs school for a standard classroom. Its like a miracle. I can leave the house and go out with him and not worry, says Sharon. I can breathe.	0.0	1.0

It was so moving, and I always remember this elderly man who would write letters ever year to his school friends who had died in the bombings. He started crying and said although he is now an old man, he can only remember his friends as children. I hope Japan make these new materials more available. That said, we tend to have a similar sort of problem in the UK, where important historical documentaries from the BBC seem to show up very sparingly and then disappear back into the vault.

Worst part was the palm oil plantations are still a finite resource, it can only go for so long before the land used is worthless. Its demand is another obvious factor but its such a shame to see these gorgeous creatures pushed back to such a tiny area compared with what they once had. Luckily we did spot a few in the trees on a river trip, including a beautiful mother and child in the canopy of a tree. If anyone is interested, take look at Sepilok, an orang-utan sanctuary in the same region, its an incredibly wonderful but also sad place.	0.0	1.0

You keep an index of who's container is where. Whenever a customer gives you the 10 day retrieval notice, you get a truck to collect the container and the customer has no idea where it's been.  This is exactly the same model. Google is the land owner. Apple store locked shipping containers on their land.   Google can't open the containers. Google doesn't know what's in the containers.

I do not believe any man in America gets more calls from women wanting to see him, meet him, or go out with him.

The normal newbie apprentice with the right guidance can do 500 to 700 in a day.   Let's assume for the first week atleast every soldier on average plants 500 trees.   That's 30000000 trees per day times 6 days a week (i mean it is china) that's 180000000 trees in a week.   Usually you'd plant in a between 1.1mx1.3m grid to a 1.8mx1.8m grid For ease let's go with a middle road of 1.5mx1.5m grid. That gives each tree 2.25mxb2 times 180000000 trees. That's 405 kmxb2  In comparison if you removed every last tree in rhode island. And let these soldiers loose in a week you'd have 13% covered.	0.0	1.0

Democracy considers it the right to vote but in a democracy such as Afghanistan are you really better off than in an autocracy like China?  Behind every 'right' there is the thinking that it's somehow black and white. In reality there is a whole load of grey and we make choices as a society about what rights really are.

Also, America is a stupid piece of shit. Those dumbfucks claim they were responsible for ending the war while it was the Soviets who defeated the Nazi's in the first place.

The US is not an important member. It has nothing to do with TPP. That ship sailed.	0.0	1.0

The intensifying politicization of this particular chapter in the history of the imperial occupation is rapidly transmuting the objective historical understanding of the narrative into propaganda. That propaganda becomes the accepted narrative of objective history on both sides, furthering dissonance between the two nations as the altered narratives become further and further entrenched as public understanding of the truth. The only thing this process accomplishes is making the governments of both sides more hesitant to give any ground or make any real progress, based on public demands/outcry.   To put the brakes on this process, the two need to stop this back and forth.

I expect that these critical regulations will be finalized very soon.  Seems a bit more ambiguous than the headline. Could drive a truck through the possible loopholes in the statement.  1) Find out if they're already illegal.  2) Draft potential legislation which would 'Make things which change legal weapons into machine guns (illegal?) illegal.'  Nothing to indicate clearly whether the Vegas guns would be classified as machine guns. It may be implied, but it is not defined.

t1_ducga93	Hello from Inner Mongolia, where I am today on a photo roadtrip. I happened to pass through a village called Lasengmiao today. The place is quite famous in China because of two depressing images taken in 2009 of the pollution caused by a huge coal-firing powerplant there. I went to the same spot, a small monastery on the top of a hill, and photographed the same area below.

The source was a mid-level Russian intelligence official who had plausible access to secret Kremlin plans.  Full article, which has a bunch of interesting notes can be found here [Trump Gets Caught in His Own Web of Lies](http://observer.com/2018/02/kremlin-officials-began-planning-donald-trump-us-presidency-in-2014/).	0.0	1.0

While its obvious to most that in the past our words (or the words of our presidents and administrations) weren't always matched by our actions, I was always happy to see a high bar set, whether we made the jump or not. Failing to live up to our own standards is still failure, or hypocrisy, but it is still important to have a standard.   In perspective, our Declaration of Independence set a very high bar, and our Constitution echoes it. If we didn't always live up to those and promote them for all people on the international stage, at least we were respecting the ideals of our founders and *trying*; that is something. In the Trump era, it seems, we're not even trying anymore. I suppose the reasoning is that its more profitable to just emphasize money, and say all those human rights efforts were *costing* us...running government like a business isn't something that inspires me, and probably doesn't inspire anyone, anywhere.	0.0	1.0

A pirate ship was a community of men who stood to be hanged if caught. They were cooperative with each other but only until they disagreed.

As for everyone else, I quite like a democracy that doesn't force everyone to pay toward things they don't understand, agree with, or consent to.   Tax everyone the same flat % and use what that generates to solve the country's issues. That's the only fair way to do it. Everything else is just arbitrary, and everytime a problem isn't solved, we're going to waste time arguing about where those arbitrary percentages should be.
