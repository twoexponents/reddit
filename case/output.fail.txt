that's works. economic downturns happen least every decade god knows long country. typical sluggish economy means free market politicians, case, republicans, get power. there's prosperity inevitably something goes wrong.then populace blames party control liberals, case dems, get power. stability arises sluggish growth pisses population blame party power cycle repeats. rarely directly blame single person/party economic downturn country. great example would kansas tax cuts implemented naive way. blame them. often times, though, mix terrible policies sides. instance, housing crash could traced back clinton/liberal era. general great recession bunch shit went wrong exact time.

stand corrected, thanks information. based articles, two questions would reasonable. first whether clinton foundation money says does. https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&orgid=16680 get *very* high marks say do, managing money well. many cases governments commit good world, easiest way fund charities good world. second question whether funds solicited pay play scheme. say australia (or number nations individuals) fund good charity based goal getting political favors return. think there's practical way answer that. *could* proven true, surprise me, *can't* really proven false; always possibility. one reason think high office holders farther removed financial even charitable dealings, kinds entanglements disqualify people office.
