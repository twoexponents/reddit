thats dont understand percentages, shouldnt used discussing topic much excess money 1% really .1% actually have. instance, bill gates: earned $11.5 billion year works ~$33.3 million per day; $1.38 million per hour; ~$23,148 per minute. understand much excess is? understand much harm poses economy? really think bill gates spends $1.38 million per hour? think spends even $500 per hour? could imagine someone **spends** $500 per hour? $1000/hr? lets say extravagant assholes lives life $1000/hr time. leaves bill gates $1.379 million per hour. wrong taxing 50-60% that? bill gates: $1,380,000 per hour. average american: $25 per hour take $1,000,000 per hour income distribute among country via tax cuts? hes still making $380,000 per hour. collectively(and scaled make less bill gates still making millions annually) injecting massive amount money back economy. people keep economies going spread purchases among great small medium large businesses throughout country. economy built purchasing power. millions people throughout country receiving pay raise spending money grow economy let thrive. allowing top unnecessarily hoard wealth could otherwise keep millions people going without grow economy. 
nationalist economic policies stupid. 
company unions effective increase wage earnings benefits employees. company close plant huge problem. point union's best opportunity offer reduced compensation plant turns around. strike cost company millions dollars thus reduce pool income available anything. hiring freezes good technique things going well bring production incentivize giving people raise. go strike get paid company get paid. instead becomes race bottom.... cam hold longer. strong trade unions recognize company make money employees make money. failing shop needs lot improvements. gm shut date plant likely want burn certain number parts. end day may cheaper resell ship parts keep people hired many weeks work left. also means would forfeit severance.

insurance company never incentive worse cash flow. allow charge higher premiums, charge whatever premiums want competition allows it. blue cross paying $200 drug kaiser paying $800 blue cross damn happy. statement true, every business would try higher costs allow charge customers more. amazon pay $800 paperclips charge $950 take home fatter margins? amazon could charge much paperclips already would they'd still interest paying more. insurers negotiate pharma companies low prices possible, problem one insurer enough market share negotiate well. hence single-payer governments getting better deals. >t interests raise price healthcare, since get percentage cost profit. companies business maximizing profit, get bigger profit charging high premiums majority leaving 40 million people uninsured insurance company *can* charge higher premiums without losing money it. losing money magically enable increase price tag levels otherwise able to, frankly make sense. insurance company paying less drug everyone else get really really rich.
