criminal ignorance worked well donald last 20 years so. allowed continually make deals shady organizations people. difference he's president comes extra level scrutiny simply cannot get away like he's done before. mueller filed report congress yet, clearly done. donald charged anything yet, mean he's cleared. like go capone gotti, immediately aim top, work way bottom, collecting prosecuting lower offenders, eventually turn cooperate, time get head criminal organization, case ironclad. even ordered comey fired, wanted mueller hard obstruction case would continue. plenty physical evidence showing donald intent obstruct justice every action. there's video evidence saying fired comey cause whole russia thing dozen tweets tries discredit investigation. like immigration fight daca travel ban, courts using trump's words evidence him.

nah, ~30 years underfunding bundeswehr catching up. root problem government want maintain force capable biddings, within germany military spending pretty unpopular. going govern increase military spending, lose voters. army unpopular beginning, sending troops abroad even worse, spending money unthinkable. therefore every government 1990 spent less less money armed forces increasing zones deployment. 1990ies alone bundeswehr bosnia, kosovo, kongo part several un-missions. simultaniously getting rid old nva equipment (which cheap either). 9/11 added atalanta, turkey afghanistan. keep mind, happened money spent forces kept roughly same. army still conscription going (which expensive, better current system), maintain force home (on paper) capable upholding end nato assignment defend europe outside threat simultaniously fight afghanistan (for equiped first place, much material needed there). since money suffice things once, decided would best save money needed less: weapons conventional warfare. needs fighters insurgents? cut spending. needs tanks insurgents? let rot. needs submarines pirates? know drill. years back hit them: russia annexes crimea know wont go further. need stuff let rust, case big bad russian actually creeps west. that's today. 30 years neglect writtled gear, end conscription destroyed successful recruiting method forces. say trump's words: germany thinks army, think best.

think depends lot mean immigrant policy well looking for. also depends lot sorts skills already have. example want come america, might wait since countries like india china (large lots aspiring immigrants) long lines get in. graduate degree get american company sponsor though lot easier come get green card (permanent residency status) difficult become citizen, takes years. even though problem that, general, america tend offer amazing benefits immigrants. enormous number resources, although large existing immigrant populations helps. european countries tend resources made available immigrants (ie. language classes, free healthcare, case stipends housing) also tends fairly difficult get countries, often even difficult become full-fledged citizen countries even living there, since longstanding history large-scale immigration, therefore tend particularly open certain countries like canada tend lie somewhere extremes (the relatively pro immigration us provide much help, ethnic protectionist european countries provide services) specific policies vary. addition, canada specifically trying decrease immigration since trump causing lots immigrants choose us, necessarily think they're population handle influx. say. there's lot consistency immigration policy countries, pros cons system tend line up. makes hard compare unless good sense looking (benefits v. ease integration) general research specific countries really way go. tl;dr immigration policies vary lot countries ways make hard determine objective best country best luck

that's works. economic downturns happen least every decade god knows long country. typical sluggish economy means free market politicians, case, republicans, get power. there's prosperity inevitably something goes wrong.then populace blames party control liberals, case dems, get power. stability arises sluggish growth pisses population blame party power cycle repeats. rarely directly blame single person/party economic downturn country. great example would kansas tax cuts implemented naive way. blame them. often times, though, mix terrible policies sides. instance, housing crash could traced back clinton/liberal era. general great recession bunch shit went wrong exact time.

china gets access western markets restricted literally time. obama exercised executive powers dozens times tenure, us state department actually intervened countries stop china free access market (germany, stopped sale german semiconductor company chinese company). that's even counting institutional things like china accused dumping selling steel price sold domestically, that's definition dumping. usa even promised stop forcing wto consider non-dumping practices dumping 2017 china filled certain criteria, china did, usa said no. get wrong, think china amazing anything, us leg stand accusing china unfair trade practices. china treating usa china always treated usa.

problem tax cut lead higher wages inflation amounts sugar high rich. higher wages would lead healthy inflation. would lead increased tax revenue could used spur economy increased interest rates (yes) new taxes slow economy. simple macro-economic management. unhealthy inflation abetting wealth inequality heating economy without evidence increase wages. so, increased interest rates occur inevitably exacerbate inequality reducing employment. worst, corresponding tax-asset restart economy spent make inflation. monies went tax cuts spent relieving student debt, making single payer health car, means relieving inequality, would turn spending would spur economy create healthy inflation. instead, gave rich good economic reason.

completely miss point, likely never exposed true leadership, actual leadership position. behaviour, inside outside actuaal job site, matters. sleeping staffers within wing line authority matters. discipline washed away, we're left mentally inadequate millennials zero clue consequences properlly lead influence people. hate ignorance, pitty opportunity exposed better, knowing expect more.

true, issues extend beyond that. presence ethnic groups matters, apparent stratification established them. even examples like karenni shan, there's still degree cooperation amongst sectarian violence. often times skirmishing, government broker ceasefire groups still engage form cooperation ceasefire capitalism. rohingya, we're seeing something completely different. they're isolated policy minority ethnic groups, individual change policy that's concerning. 
fucked sounds right. short term seem trying encourage population emigrate country work, especially areas affect new belt road initiative like kazakhstan central asian republics, population density incredibly low. i'm guessing hoping rid lot young middle aged unmarried men, something china abundance since one child policy. long term aging population cost greatly, especially seeing current old generation definitely longest living one chinese history far. problem west well china whole different scale. plays prediction emergence chinese welfare state: party can't let old people die seeing generation key building modern chinese nation. despite many chinese people getting rich past 40 years, vast majority simply saw life conditions increase important yet still moderate ways. thus idea whole generation either saved retirement access pension far true. seeing probably can't provide since legitimacy party depends immensely achievements, cpc little choice fully embrace life expenses dying generation. cost hit party bosses hardest much new young generation workers china. again, speculation. might educated guesses, they're still guesses. 
second point entirely inaccurate concentrations co2 we're discussing here. put bag head, definitely experience conditions co2 builds up. different. walk pool concentrated co2 cave, basement sewer, drop floor unconscious rapidly die. feel woozy, lose consciousness. many first responders die event gas leaks, underestimate danger gas time go try pull person trouble. drop dead, too, instances several people died succession trying rescue went them.

(according to? also, instead quotation i'd want factual language instead citation statements taxes. easily checked confirmed.) --- **b.** article also visibly connected related articles kind index increased coherency links aggregated information put revised timestamps reason changes (the latter bit like wikipedia). remind us old articles (instead forgetting article day), see we've potentially missed, old info still considered accurate give us general overview topic. type really stripped info (in separate box side near top) would reduce possibility individual bias muddying facts readers rhetoric. **c.** regular article. (it also clearly stated owns paper somewhere.) **d.** based accuracy (and/or well new standard upheld) could independent agency checking awarding good news corporations (like un check elections tampering michelin rates restaurants instance). optional good behavior rating award news corporations (free) quality pr, added credibility readers. something desirable, *but earned*. agency allowed accept money special interests funding listed. edit: fixed formatting, added reasoning d. probably messed entire comment horribly, hope people understand i'm going though. i'd love input anyone thoughts suggestions it. **tl;dr: idea create new optional standard streamline news reporting order (as unbiased humanly possible) highlight facts add credibility coherency.**

actually term limits greatly exacerbate problem, see trend clearly american system. enact term limits limit tenure politicians, makes politicians reliant corporate sector employment public career ends, know can't rest laurels comfortable public sector job forever need another gig. trend completely blatant america: politicians get office back large campaign finance donations corporations, less they're told auction office, leave, they're rewarded parasitic cushy 6-7 figure job think-tank consultancy. coincidence last decades, tenure public servants decreased quantity, quality sharply declined. career politicians, faults, many ways resistant rely office employment, relatively good salary, accompanying perks. none applies xi case. he's incredibly rich well-off family, need money, probably going rule life, removed rendered incapable old age illness, importantly actually vision china (to restore chinese power), petty grifting. going bought company ever; rather, he's probably going bend private sector state's prc traditionally done still does. lowly american politician looking get gig heritage foundation clinton foundation spending entire career selling public interest. term limits baseless idea anyways. enacted us presidency republicans conservative democrats aggrieved shocked far-reaching reforms roosevelt managed carry new deal, determined let another roosevelt opportunity again. time terms limit passed, according polling, american public split less 50-50 issue. never sound democratic reason proffered term limits.

$3000 price tag passed along insurance company. company raise rates everyone order pay incorrect. get bill trip hospital. bill says $3000 pill. luckily insurance pays 90%, list bill owe 300 bucks. whew! wow sure lucky insurance company paid $2700. didn't. insurance company paid 100. (and that's exceedingly generous) negotiate rates supplier 400, knowing pay 75% cost still list full price bill. ***no one except uninsured pays full rate.*** problem, we, individuals representation insurance companies do, cannot negotiate price, therefore pay full price insured. true share costs, predatory, like assuming.

'contradictions' contributing increased divide country? first all, get connection b. think way. country, culture, civilization roots certain values permeate everyday life culture. society whole, nation, enshrines laws constitutions kind core value like respect life steal people everyday lives, grow ideals, feel respecting life stealing important, core social values. happens values contradictory values? psyche almost subconsciously bombarded exceptions violations core values daily basis. cope? example, us, even beginning, declared liberty freedom people utmost importance yet institutionalized slavery existed, even (with great effort) excised society, segregation racial oppression existed least another century. read article today interesting, black woman took 60-something year old mother see black panther theatre got mother reminisced how, young, enter theatre back sit rows behind far away whites. still people alive today remember, viscerally, one shocking contradiction. think psychological effect? nobody questions possibly catastrophic psychological effects domestic violence children parents, nobody really wants consider effect national scale. another contradiction, love democracy essentially follows everything ever said american politician, ever. democracy true freedom, needs protected, way, etc. yet united states snuffed democratic governments modern history name political convenience. address contradiction? economic contradictions. wealthiest country planet apparently afford provide citizens basic healthcare, spend trillion dollars military. wealthiest country planet people living poverty total populations entire countries, country absurd distribution wealth. kinds ingrained contradictions every aspect american society have, opinion, pronounced effect harmoniousness society, everyday people live everyday lives react everyday situations events. two core values collide extreme contradiction, way people mentally try rationalize solve also becomes extreme. russian propaganda trying turn moderate-extreme liberals extreme liberals moderate extreme republicans extreme republicans. russian propaganda though. going since forever obvious side effect two party system constantly juggles contradictions back forth, offer new old new solutions deliberately repeatedly failing actually address substantial way. love guns/pursuit gun control, resistance to/pursuit healthcare, anger towards immigrants none new phenomenon. they're symptoms underlying contradictions heart problem. russian meddling small poke incredibly fragile object.

whoops! sure went tangent, wound conclusion that's hilariously incorrect. whole opioid epidemic might heard news? letting doctors use collective best judgement, filtered entire system pharmaceutical kickbacks. situation simple easy. wanted be, settled off-brand bit resolution. so, actively increased ignorance real life. could, i'd make people get prescriptions write internet comments. meta/bio/physical interaction far beyond understanding make irresponsible. like let doctors decide best. (know actually works? whole field pain management clusterfuck unanswered mysteries? giving patients need next couple days, stressing powerful opioids compared normal pain management options. study found lot doctors using professional opinions all, normal human desires keep humans pain-free. good intentions national/global epidemic.)

really understand economics trade, you? trump starts trade war, means firstly, us consumers pay everything produced using goods services us natural competitive advantage. theory, nearly everything tv's houses, paper internet access, increase price. food, water, gasoline ,etc stay price, course consider producers products really things like imported steel make tractors, prime movers drilling rigs. top that, producers smaller markets unable export due trade war need increase margins us cover lower volumes. means secondly rest world reduce consumption us products swap suppliers. eg. europe china source meat grains countries like australia brazil. prices go up, sure, anywhere near much us. biggest effect would countries like china vietnam, currently provide low cost labour powers $200 tv's $5 toys. they'll instead sell $180 tv's $4 toys whilst us consumers pay $300 tv's $10 toys!
