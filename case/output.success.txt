that's works. economic downturns happen least every decade god knows long country. typical sluggish economy means free market politicians, case, republicans, get power. there's prosperity inevitably something goes wrong.then populace blames party control liberals, case dems, get power. stability arises sluggish growth pisses population blame party power cycle repeats. rarely directly blame single person/party economic downturn country. great example would kansas tax cuts implemented naive way. blame them. often times, though, mix terrible policies sides. instance, housing crash could traced back clinton/liberal era. general great recession bunch shit went wrong exact time.

propagandized sir mam. **fact** killers encouraged coverage they're copycats. killings happen reported. spree killers complex. prevent news coverage: (1) mention shooter's name show face. (2) localize story. (3) emphasize weapon used. (4) emphasize body count. (5) focus story victims were, importance. yet: (1) shooter prepared graphic face story. (2) story international news, asking president comment. (3) weapon used cited cause. (4) body count scored body counts, giving achievements (the worst mass shooting since..). (5) victims faceless de-emphasized, instead focusing reactions public killer. tell what's going on.
