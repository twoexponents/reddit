t1_dusz0qa	0.938300	*	Don't want to be the devil's advocate but nutting when you want helps your mind, therefore it helps your performance. A relaxed professional is better than a horny one
t1_duw24du	0.273200	*	>Genocide isn't the answer  You are entitled to your opinion. Nation states should consider all available options.
t1_dudo3yo	0.868900	*	It's definitely meant to be a joke. The Joker being a mass-murdering psychopath, but he has standards like that? It's unexpected and funny.
t1_dugqmsj	0.000000	*	At least you guys have a catchy national anthem. I don't even know my countries anthem. I know our national animal is the Unicorn but that's about it.
t1_dubbhmy	0.000000	*	Absolutely. There's in an overwhelming amount of evidence. It doesn't just hinge on testimony from James Clapper. But I guess it just boils down to what your definition of interference is. 
t1_duj7jdj	0.000000	*	Anywhere really.
t1_dupyso9	0.296000	*	Literally every single time. This is an article about North Korean cheerleaders that has absolutely nothing to do with the US. 
t1_dudygnt	-0.757900	*	That has to be infuriating.   Dr: Do this to fix your problem  Patient: nah.
t1_dui9auv	-0.024000	*	5% is the same no matter what it is out of. That's kind of the point of percents. And in this case, since we are talking about 100 billion dollars, it's kind of a huge amount.   Edit: can't grammar
t1_duz2r8c	0.854500	*	Are you saying the investigation is about to come to an end? Lol. Because if so, I will save that comment too ! Lol.
t1_ducj8zl	-0.624900	*	I would say whatever the worst mix of variables is, that is probably what's happening.
t1_duk7qzw	0.648600	*	Lol. The economy recovered because of Obama but Trump took credit for that too.

t1_dv38fes	-0.128000	*	Define hate-speech. Then, give me an example of hate-speech on T_D.   If you can do that, I will accept that I am wrong. If not, my point still stands.

t1_dusnvoh	0.025800	*	It's obvious by now that nothing that Trump says or does will matter to his base. They will vote for him anyway.

t1_dv05zo6	0.000000	*	*Pi'yin.
t1_dutozcw	-0.880700	*	I would caution against dehumanizing people with differing political views as trash. It's ugly and unnecessary, and leads people mentally down roads that are bad for themselves and society.
t1_duq79ru	-0.273200	*	You're talking about this incident. I'm talking about Israel behavior after any shit this commit. Try to keep up. 
t1_ducbmwu	0.476700	*	And the US has higher standards for mad cow disease inspection.   Turn about is fair play when both players are using ulterior motives to protect domestic industry. 
t1_dur93no	0.153100	*	Yeah but those fires can be put out and oil extraction resumed. 
t1_duj093w	-0.141900	*	I don't agree with many of their policies but don't you think that's a bit too much, blyat?

t1_duqgtfu	-0.598400	*	Why not? Heaps of unbelievably shitty things have been done by many countries. Soon enough, something will eclipse that, and people move on to the next uproar.

t1_duhz42h	-0.542300	*	If that's the case, then they should be reporting those people to the Reddit admins rather than making an edit about it. Harassment via PM is against Reddit's rules.
t1_dud6dgc	-0.771700	*	I see those as symptoms of their real motivators. I would restate what you wrote as:  1. Fear of those who have more power than them  2. Contempt and denial for those who point out number 1.
t1_dua4sd2	0.790200	*	I assume its mostly just some companies that really love guns in your country.   If something like that happened here we would flip out. 
t1_dv41s7i	0.553200	*	The video actually cuts off before the punchline.  But I'm not gonna ruin it, just watch blue mountain state, it's hilarious.
t1_dv10cvh	0.680800	*	Yes there actually was. The Wikipedia page has a lot of good citations. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_effects_of_Brexit

t1_duayhi5	0.401900	*	You should look at the political spectrum of Germany and compare merkels positions to the left and the green...aka the liberal parties.   If Donald Trump is far right...so is Angela Merkel.
t1_dv0pljj	-0.659700	*	None of us chose anything. Fuck all elitist shits who think their being shat out into the world from a queens crotch makes them better. Petty and silly beings are we.
t1_duw7ie5	0.372400	*	Here is part of the problem. You are buying into the 2 party system. There were other choices. The system is not broken, the citizenry is. 
t1_duykalg	0.718400	*	lol ok if you want to believe that because your group think overlords told you so then go ahead and hand waive it all away. Ignore the actual evidence. 
t1_dubnewz	0.140600	*	No offense but with how little funding from the federal government sends to California I think we have a fair claim to leave the union.
t1_dv1axu7	0.458800	*	But it's in the public's interest to see what ISIS is doing.  Does the law apply if they blurred the victim's face?

t1_dv22stj	-0.292400	*	> Actually no the tariff times did NOT fuck the government.  They said funded, not fucked
t1_duwmb1y	0.000000	*	Hes talking about the US nurses making that much.
t1_dun9dzz	0.624900	*	Yes, same as police officers, soldiers security, federal agents and armed citizens.   Should guns be removed from all of the above because some are idiots? 
t1_dv20lvs	0.757400	*	Because it's extremely subjective. For example, is banning drugs to protect people good or bad because they have more freedom even though it causes deaths?
t1_dv202ru	0.420400	*	Actually, where I live it's called the GST and amazingly helps pay for my healthcare. The fact that you prefer to not pay taxes is not the worlds problem
t1_dungw4x	-0.019100	*	We voted for Clinton. We voted for Gore. It didn't matter. 
t1_duw7dhc	0.000000	*	Turd.
t1_dv2l30w	0.263500	*	Clinton really wasn't a good choice either.  Better than Trump for sure, but that election forced us to decide between two candidates who were pretty big steps down from Obama.
t1_duwgg55	0.240700	*	Opiates cause a lot of problems but deafness isn't one.  Not that this excuses Limbaugh of anything, but you certainly sound a little silly claiming it.

t1_duh03bh	-0.401900	*	That's just insane
t1_dur0ck2	0.659700	*	It is possible to admire a group of people while acknowledging that they had flaws.  I would count the tarring and feathering as a huge flaw

t1_dv0qvmb	-0.935000	*	> However I do know for a fact that you have hate speech and anti-holocaust denial laws. So you dont have free speech.   Holocaust denial and hate speech are not protected under free spech.
t1_duz12xp	-0.557400	*	As far as I've seen Americans (such as myself) do not find the ISO standard confusing. It's dates with slashes and year last that get confusing.

t1_dul1ph8	-0.709600	*	And frankly, the problem with heroin for users is not being able to get high quality stuff. It is possible to keep using without increasing the dose. H needs to be decriminalized, possibly legalized.

t1_duvkpcc	-0.052500	*	Kinda weird when you think about it.  Allah is down with a kind of interspecies sex but not with homosexuality?

t1_dugpweo	0.381800	*	Forces candidates to appeal to the whole country and not just 3 or 4 cities. Most of the country benefits from the system.

t1_dur91aa	-0.338400	*	You're completely ignorant of the real world.
t1_duc88ur	-0.865800	*	Russia is pathetic and sad. They're just north Korea with oil. Tiny economy, weak military, has to resort to Internet trolling to be relevant.

t1_dv01zjo	0.421500	*	Venezuela's economy is 70% privatized. The only reason it's even that high is due to oil exports. That's not socialist. I'm not even a socialist, but yeah. 
t1_duvz4cf	-0.102700	*	Crops for one. Hard to run a civilization when the crop yields are all over the place due to drought, mineral depletion, heat waves, etc.
t1_dv3gdqv	-0.923100	*	No the guy said anxiety meds, flu vax, and electronic gadgets are scams lol. I only commented on the flu vax cuz idk wtf hes even talking about with the others.

t1_dugmfqf	0.000000	*	How were you not aware of that? Do you just not keep track of the political climate in the country, or what?
t1_duqbjwj	0.440400	*	The Russians always were good at chess.
t1_dufxp1j	0.836000	*	Your post doesnt exactly scream that you are enlightened or any smarter then the average American.  Just from that one post looks like you are quite willing to dismiss any kind of deep thoughtfulness.
t1_duumdkt	0.226300	*	Its like were the fools playing chess, and all the while theyre playing Chinese checkers. 
t1_duguwyt	0.102700	*	No, that was just Farage and Gove being bullshitters and the tabloid loving morons of the country lapping it up and quoting a fucking bus.   Also maybe Russians. 
t1_dufuiqc	0.000000	*	Just teenagers? 
t1_duhtin5	-0.542300	*	Then why are you against specificity to stop a whole group (British people) being included when it's a specific group from a specific place? your own logic defeats you.

t1_ductqh7	0.000000	*	It's not even about getting Trump. It's that this is all they have for today. He's just keeping us updated?
t1_dun5mhy	0.000000	*	gremlins
t1_dv27htx	-0.250000	*	Nope, the left is against hate, and has more empathy.  If ever your kids are kicked out or down, its the left that will try to help you.

t1_dubq3th	0.361200	*	Like a square and a rectangle
t1_dv3u065	-0.128000	*	That's not what anyone's saying.   No one thinks that's the sole reason you voted for anything.   We're saying Russia ran a propaganda campaign, and got some help from Trump associates. 
t1_duqrqmu	-0.250000	*	Making bad choices on deciding to spent tens of thousands on an education that doesnt return the investment is not equal to what our education system is like. 
t1_duq8tuv	0.440400	*	Check the account you're replying to. It is a good candidate for being a paid opinion pusher.

t1_dupum6t	0.457600	*	His reply read very clearly to me as a light-hearted response to your jest. Perhaps your heckles are raised a bit high? It would be understandable in the current political climate.
t1_dv24v9n	-0.514100	*	Oh so you admit your country's system is fucked. 
t1_dum441d	0.796400	*	Trump gave a phone call, then 2 days later he got a huge ton of gifts from China and now he is silent on the issue.  You better hope he don't sell Taiwan to China.

t1_dudhh7r	-0.025800	*	AR just means Armalite. There's and AR shotgun that's an AR-something. I forget the number. Gun Jesus has a good video on it
t1_duyklty	0.000000	*	just because the receiver isn't legitimate, doesn't mean the sender or the message isn't.  
t1_duow62p	0.690800	*	Depending on what you're caring out. You can't recycle paper products that have foods on them. The grease and the like interferes with the recycling process.

t1_due8aih	0.296000	*	Yeah youre probably right.
t1_dv4yllz	-0.318200	*	Yep. That's why all of us need to go out and vote against every.single.GOP.candidate in 2018. Dems retake the house and Senate and they can actually impeach his ass before the house is just ash.
t1_duqkpct	-0.284600	*	Unless in cases of impeachment. In which, Trump will be tried for his crimes and sentenced. However, Trump can avoid being sentenced by resigning, but everyone else still takes the fall.

t1_duwncbo	0.000000	*	Thats how it works in Eastern Europe
t1_duotzy7	0.000000	*	There used to be a guy who'd occasionally do drug math. He once calculated that Warren Buffet could buy a enough cocaine to make a 747 out of cocaine.
t1_ducny2f	0.931900	*	Pretty weird how the land of the free imprisons a greater percentage of its population than any nation in history eh? Free to follow our corporate overlords perhaps, but not free in any true sense 
t1_duck0ov	0.000000	*	I know this because the MEMO wasn't released and the News Media said it was because of classified materials. 
t1_dune7lf	-0.019100	*	Doesn't matter.

t1_dv017z5	0.510600	*	I don't think you'd get as much PR for going to Africa to defend white people from black people. Honestly can you picture that? Strikes me as a pretty hard sell.
t1_dv40k27	0.510600	*	Useless, except for being the only source of effective production and intelligent design in the entire known universe...
t1_dv3wta8	0.000000	*	I don't see any way to justify $3/hr median with a company that routinely recruits for $20-$30/hr

t1_dud2d48	0.585900	*	Well yes, yes he is. That's the story, Russia paid millions to get Trump elected.   How are you disputing this?

t1_duyqak2	0.796400	*	he fumbled words but it came off like an average person just fumbling a weird sentence. Trump has the diction of a 5th grader and speaks with full confidence. it's different 
t1_dv1mil8	0.000000	*	You forgot to rearrange the comma. That adds a few more combinations.
t1_dur77da	0.000000	*	The people without guns are going to try and illegally take away the guns from the people with the guns? Wait, we have the second amendment?  MOLON LABE

t1_dulpe1j	-0.854200	*	I agree simply handing money to them without trying to integrate them into our system is a bad idea. But simply shrugging and ignoring human misery isn't a solution either.

t1_dunq9wl	-0.318200	*	> or executed for political dissent  [like in 2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Boris_Nemtsov)?  There is a lot of dissident prosecution in Russia, and you know it ;)
t1_dv1zlsd	-0.273200	*	Careful you don't put too much sugar in the koolaid. You'll just crash harder when it wears off.
t1_duuv5fx	-0.556800	*	What exactly do they fear? This baffles me time and again. We live in the most propserous and safe times ever in our western democracies. What is there to fear?
t1_duzdpxk	-0.818700	*	Er.....President Ford gave Nixon a very unusal pardon, which saved him from criminal prosecution.    Clinton settled out of court before perjury charges could be made. Lost his law license.  
t1_dulmx62	0.440400	*	unless you use that economy for supporting a proper public education system. So you'll have later lots of professionals who happened to be born somewhere else.
t1_dugvpjf	-0.607200	*	If you say so man. Im not convinced but I respect your opinion.
t1_dv1elcn	-0.025800	*	To who else would we leave the power but those we elect?
t1_dupkrxu	0.151800	*	All the Muslims I know, who actually acknowledge that they are one, do not drink. Its like if I was a free market capitalist but then believed in a social welfare state. Then Im not the former.
t1_duf73by	-0.361200	*	If the proof was that substantial, then the judge would have refused bail due to the risk to the public. 
t1_dua9l1f	-0.401900	*	>  we'd lose all the power we currently hold within the union.  That's already lost... Kind of what the vote was about.
t1_dujepd2	-0.927400	*	Man there was a recent string of brutal murders of lesbians. One was even literally set on fire. This stuff still happens. You're wrong to say it's over. 
t1_dusknwc	0.858800	*	He only won because Hilary was hated among her own party. So many people are hopefully gonna be more motivated to vote next election to make sure the cheetoh doesn't get reelected.
t1_duh5mka	-0.757900	*	There is no need for a religious police to arrest people who dress differently. Look at France and their arrests of women who wore the so-called burkini.

t1_dudz9w1	-0.131600	*	I agree, it's very good for the rich and leaves the poor to suffer and die, or cripple themselves in debt.   The question is; is that good?

t1_dur4he0	0.226300	*	Please tell me how it would be feasible to suddenly relocate and house and feed 30 million people. It's honestly a stupid idea.
t1_dufj5n9	-0.296000	*	It's mainly because most people don't know the government regularly censors the media  id imagine 
t1_dujmtew	-0.599400	*	There is no reproducible study that shows vaccines cause autism. The conflicting conclusion only exists in the minds of anti-vaxxers and their bogus publications.

t1_dv53bis	-0.381800	*	Even worse, straight and lesbian women are protected,  gay men are not.   if there was an aids vaccine and it was withheld specifically so that gay people keep dying in droves there'd be outrage,

t1_duuq3hz	0.000000	*	Do you understand the definition of corrupt?
t1_dv0zle2	0.458800	*	Yeah man, way to sway people to your side. Insult and talk down to the people who are interested and curious about what you're saying. Make sure to throw in some racism apologism for good measure.
t1_duxjoio	-0.401900	*	That depends on if he starts making trouble in their neighborhood. 
t1_duzryiw	0.318200	*	I'm sure you refute articles from Breitbart and don't just immediately dismiss them because Breitbart, right?

t1_dv555jy	-0.242000	*	The EU does not allow trade deals on a country by country basis. The US will accept all of the EU or none. That's the whole point of being one giant trading block.
t1_dup70qs	0.440400	*	If that's true then it works both ways. I'm sure fishermen will stop after the tenth sunk boat.
t1_duoay6r	0.000000	*	I was going to say not everyone is so dour as to think that, but it is Russia.
t1_duszgp0	0.536200	*	Machinegun went to the US to join Splyce right? That's honestly the last I heard of that team. I figured when he got cut from Splyce he went back to Mongolz?

t1_dulbrwx	0.467800	*	Do tell me then how are you going to make a bunch of kids be interested in philosophy.  It might make you think but majority has no interest in thinking more than absolutely necessary.

t1_dudr9va	-0.227300	*	No its regulating.  Government here in Canada doesn't pay for prescription drugs yet they still set prices for them. It has nothing to do with bulk purchases.
t1_durd4wb	0.202300	*	I've seen people say that - the Japanese had it coming because of Pearl Harbor - too.  But it's fine. It's late here for me, so I'll be going away soon.

t1_dugaz49	0.672800	*	For sure. But that doesn't mean society has to be. We don't create nature, but we certainly create society. Injustices only exist because enough of us accept them.

t1_duj2ax1	-0.457600	*	It's even more insane of yoy think about how common it is for (married, straight) Republicans to be caught having gay sex in bathrooms. Almost as if they're projecting their own desires...
t1_duplnws	0.340000	*	That's where youre wrong my Mom worked for a company that was contracted by the U.S. government to help them assimilate back into society and find jobs. But nice try.

t1_dusk0ey	0.000000	*	About the same shade of orange, though
t1_dv5ey3e	0.226300	*	It's great to change wasteful habits. It's denial to think it will slow the collapse.

t1_dupmz5n	0.421500	*	Also, as a Christian, I think there is nothing more Christian than universal health care. I have a hard time comprehending why some Christians in the US oppose it. 
t1_duv27de	0.690800	*	If you look at any of the China's People Congress meetings, the votes are something like 2592 to 1, that is a 99.86% agreement vote. Now is that really a vote?

t1_duqqym0	-0.299600	*	There wasn't even any screaming about him during the campaign.  The left needs to work on their conspiracy theory game.

t1_duokdiy	-0.340000	*	Dunno much about it really. It just makes sense that if a mental health professional says you can't handle your finances, you can't be allowed to buy a gun.
t1_duxeyo3	-0.714000	*	I disagree. The impression you gave was that recent events in US lead to this ban.

t1_duni2qg	0.361200	*	I agree in the sense that culture is one of many results of religion.
t1_durujyq	0.680800	*	That's true, but what they are doing to any Kurdish group that gets big enough is insane. Turks are pretty cool but something needs to happen to their government to put them in their place.
t1_duwhux1	0.485700	*	140 people *is* a lot, yes. A company in the army is generally smaller than that.  How many Swedish foreign fighters are there in Syria in Iraq? Enough that 140 is trivial!?
t1_dupzti6	0.000000	*	Yes...?
t1_duawcus	0.599400	*	I'd say it shows that one time the US managed to rebuild a country successfully by supporting totalitarian leadership because it was extraordinarily strategically located. ;)
t1_dv39r7m	0.128000	*	In this instance, no.   Do I support affirmative action in general? Maybe in some situations.

t1_dugx2zo	0.610800	*	If it works, it's a good play that minimizes bloodshed.  If it doesn't work, America collapses, world war 3 happens, and the Dark Ages 2 starts.  Hopefully you made the right decision.

t1_dui553p	0.749000	*	Couldn't anyone that owns a small business do those same things? It seems like a business owner loophole more than a rich person loophole

t1_duj1eva	0.077200	*	Russia has produced a lot:  Tchaikovsky Space travel Tolstoy Dostoyevsky Chekov  Compare them to an actual shithole country, like Nigeria. There's no actual comparison. 
t1_dul3fuc	0.000000	*	Thinking that history just moves in one direction ineluctably is delusionally anti-naturalistic.  I am indeed showing a well-adjusted consideration of the world we live in there.

t1_dv2mr3o	0.165500	*	Fair enough, I often have to remind myself that the loudest and most radicalized people are the ones you see posting a bunch but they are often a vocal minority.

t1_dun6isu	0.000000	*	Let's not bring Clintons into this.
t1_dv11xzk	-0.296000	*	No, not Gove. It wasnt someone particularly high profile, or even a politician. Just a radio debate between two commentators/journalists. 
t1_dufu2i2	0.129800	*	The pretty thing about law is that it treat everyone equally. Bibi might be corrupt but it wouln't be fair to prioratize his case when there are cases aginst other government officials.
t1_dunhp1c	0.458800	*	No it's not. I've never seen any Koreans treat their daughters or granddaughters like that, and I know a ton of Koreans because a lot of Koreans only hang out with other Koreans
t1_dugvf53	-0.817600	*	* Lies barefacedly * Represents horrible right wing and nationalist ideas * Acts a bit dumb * Well thought of by many despite the first two points   He's an American Boris Johnson
t1_dumph0s	-0.876700	*	Sure it could be worse. Cops wrongfully kill people in chaotic situations all the time. Should we take their guns too??
t1_du9zwpv	-0.893400	*	Ah page 16 not 20.  It says that Belgium, France, and Germany are due to terrorist conflicts. That seems fair to me.  But how the fuck is India, **Ukraine**, and Russia suspect?
t1_dv2fzq7	-0.401900	*	'clean' water act (allows fracking materials to be dumped into the ocean)

t1_dv2o4ro	-0.624900	*	It's beyond mind-boggling that he could run a casino into bankruptcy. You have to be the worst businessman on the face of the planet if you can do that.

t1_ducusih	0.000000	*	The US has been meddling with elections around the globe for decades... What's so different? 
t1_duz41y3	0.025800	*	Read Mearsheimer and Walt's book on the Israel lobby.  The Felcher basically described what those two provided evidence of in their book.
t1_dugqat8	0.327200	*	>The IC is supposed to be so good at that.  You guys made that claim. Literally all your responses are born from fallacy, and are impossible to argue due to that nature.
t1_dv3jssq	0.713300	*	Already ate the cookie, sorry..  and the sentence (written mouthfull) is vague by choice.. so like a riddle, soni can give you the cookie back (prechewed for easier digestion)  
t1_duhcwz0	-0.829000	*	Huh just read about them. I agree now. Course all ISIS soldiers participated in war crimes I think so it's a damn shame they can't all be executed.
t1_duxcpe6	0.507000	*	Well, that's true. You also don't have the right not to have your opinion challenged. If you don't want to listen, that just makes you a bigot.
t1_ducvm88	0.000000	*	Feel the Bern 2020! Bernie or Bust!
t1_dv2wclu	-0.296000	*	No, it is not. This is exactly what I meant. 
t1_duykne4	-0.275500	*	If you don't like the facts, change them? 
t1_duz4e3p	-0.542300	*	Uhh, that's not how this works. The fuck? It's 100% up to government regulators to decided these things. If it's not allowed someone has to say that.
t1_duq1ikn	0.000000	*	Kanye is next in the chute. 
t1_duiparn	-0.038700	*	Talk to literally any Korean.  They want it.  They know it will be difficult, but they want it.  
t1_dup5pow	0.000000	*	Your answer wasnt in the form of a question you normie 
t1_dv2jfbs	0.000000	*	I did below: the economy of the US is not dependent on any particular resource, much less a limited-resource one (it's kind of obvious)
t1_dv4r7e9	-0.325200	*	You must live in the middle of nowhere lol
t1_dv0qygp	0.440400	*	I'm sure she's challenging it.  But she knew what she was getting in to. She was looking for the attention.
t1_dv05072	0.226300	*	I've been seeing some pretty bizarre comments here.  This story seems to have brought the psychotics out

t1_duljg99	-0.080300	*	Not giving a shit about something that rips your society apart,  is not going to stop it from ripping your society apart.

t1_duvhuyi	0.458800	*	Honestly this still happen in the Netherlands..
t1_duqn3sm	-0.224900	*	Well, it would certainly thin the gene pool that led to autism...  On the other hand, you know, dead kids, not great.
t1_duojjol	0.892200	*	Maybe, but new elections would likely help him.  He's a fairly mainstream right-wing party, presumably the corruption cloud hanging over Likud would help Kulanu get more votes.
t1_dv3fu55	0.585900	*	The beauty of the Donald is that they learned everything that SRS has been doing for years and used it against them. Now all of the sudden it's a problem...okay.
t1_dubz4an	0.000000	*	It doesn't.  Is the US breaking international law by enforcing its own rules within its own borders?
t1_duwm0pi	-0.403300	*	The most I've ever heard someone paying is 200. I've never bought one before and dont live in a MM state. But 1000 seems a little outrageous and inaccessible.
t1_duzzjqj	-0.723600	*	Could you imagine the briefing telling Trump that thousands of Africans are headed towards America seeking asylum? Then the moment he finds out they're all white?  It might kill him
t1_dufjsqw	0.000000	*	But you still know that EU English> British English. 
t1_duoy30g	0.659700	*	Yeah, I would say that if he's got stars in his hands and the sun for a face, he's going to look pretty white.
t1_dv41j88	0.000000	*	OP's mom
t1_dv588ep	0.421500	*	It was actually a reference to the third episode of Mr Robot. I assume paying for it just makes everything a lot easier.
t1_duj3gns	0.000000	*	Methinks you don't know much about curling, especially not the mixed variant.
t1_duf5n5b	0.000000	*	Found JFK.
t1_dv3vn2k	0.153100	*	Humans are the exception. What we have become and created puts our destructive powers well beyond natural limits. 
t1_duwol76	-0.476700	*	You are wrong, Apple moved their global headquarters to Ireland.  
t1_dunu2lu	-0.340000	*	> who may or may not be on the same side of the issue as I am  Gun rights are non negotiable, not up for debate. End of story.

t1_dv385ad	0.421500	*	Lol the post that /u/RetardCat69 has posted doesnt mention any of the subreddits you called out. If you are going call someone out at least provide some citations
t1_duhjtfx	0.000000	*	This is, apparently a very unpopular opinion.
t1_dudr39h	-0.051600	*	Just passing through. I swear.

t1_dv0v57c	0.000000	*	How about posting that picture of Putin as a gay activist?
t1_dusqhf8	0.025800	*	So, you think that his audience are stupid and they need to be talked to like they are lacking in the most basic of adult thinking capabilities? We both agree that Trump supporters are stupid. 
t1_duntie8	0.000000	*	> tried a whole bunch  What human rights has he tried to take away? 
t1_duq8ske	0.493400	*	That is true and I applaud them on that one. That was quite dangerous. They do good work I just don't agree with their view of the 2nd amendment. 
t1_dutdkd8	0.000000	*	Also because the melting ice caps that supply the food plains in Tigris/Euphrates don't flood as much as they used to, combined with artificial dams...
t1_dusvo6b	0.544800	*	Maybe if Chile had done the same they wouldn't have been fucked by the US.
t1_dunww16	-0.585900	*	Stop paying for illegals to live here.  Estimated 90 billion a year 23 in California alone.  Both problems solved.  
t1_dunf8q4	0.401900	*	Lunatic?  I see you are a mature and wise name-caller.
t1_durzd0p	0.000000	*	The sole reason why Greece, a NATO nation, is armed to the teeth is because of Turkey, a NATO nation.
t1_dv1k38y	0.000000	*	Heil Trumpler
t1_dupiiq5	-0.493900	*	Its also based on fear. They started removing nuclear power plants when Fukushima happened. 
t1_dwdigq8	-0.241500	*	This so much. The ban has been in effect for nearly a month now. I'm 20 and I got ID'd for a monster can. It's patronising and I hope this gets outlawed as discrimination
t1_dv37ijc	0.151300	*	No, more like finding a russian dudes asshole
t1_dusuq5c	-0.526700	*	Then no official sources needed, a text by someone knowledgeable (and who's not afraid to take sides, no neutrality bullshit) that presents a reasoning that we can follow.
t1_duun9ax	0.493900	*	I love that you actually have the nerve to equivocate acts of war with a self selected genocide.  Good lord.
t1_dusq10b	0.000000	*	If it isn't public how does one know whether they are on the list or not?
t1_dugric7	0.000000	*	What filter? Are they editing the press conferences?

t1_dv0ju8k	-0.586800	*	Anti-terrorism doesnt equal less terrorists, it means more of them.
t1_due9els	0.202300	*	Resist the siren's song of the handlebar moustache and skinny jeans combo and you'll be just fine.
t1_dv39fkc	0.592700	*	I briefly did, but my friends and a few good arguments shook it up for me. I ended up being pro-Hillary by the time the election came around. 
t1_dumqgxi	0.571900	*	Hillary won by over 3 million votes, you can't really compare counties with little over 20 people with counties with 10 times the amount 
t1_dumn83d	0.000000	*	Yea, i've noticed.
t1_duylqyl	0.000000	*	People don't remember, but most of the listeners for FDR's fireside chats were Russian bots.

t1_dv177sr	-0.659700	*	That's fucked up
t1_duympux	-0.804700	*	Money Laundering mostly, but also being an unregistered agent of a foreign power and lying to the FBI. Google it, there's quite a lot of different charges. 
t1_dulpi1j	0.476700	*	That only says the member states are to respect 1951 Refugee Convention and 1967 protocol, which most of the world does regardless.
t1_dulpamj	0.493900	*	> Islamic culture that inspired this event.  Which part of Islamic culture involves driving trucks into people?

t1_duvxm7x	-0.153100	*	No, do it.  It's incredible. Just don't try to hike the volcano still up from the night before in loafers.  It's possible,  but not advised. 
t1_duozsw2	0.000000	*	And politicians iirc they are quite involved there.
t1_duzslyx	0.700300	*	You mean ease into a comfortable homoerotic beanbag-esque chair?
t1_duh1ibf	0.448400	*	A proxy war in Syria would beg to differ. We've done a 180 on our loyalties there. If this plays all the way out, he will most certainly hang for it.
t1_dv3ghau	-0.636900	*	...Says the Nazi scumbag.

t1_dur18id	0.000000	*	And retards
t1_dv3irnm	0.000000	*	The fact that that story wasn't bigger news floors me. Can you imagine the backlash if Obama had said something about taking guns without due process?
t1_dv37idg	0.614200	*	Donny two scoops winning the election might turn out to be a good thing for us. Imagine if the govt got scooped by someone who was more competent. Wed be in even more deep shit.

t1_duv0nyq	-0.016400	*	Because the drugs are so expensive and difficult to acquire. If they are sold legally and regulated then the drug users will go do drugs by themselves in peace and leave everyone else alone.

t1_dubhru4	0.000000	*	The whole world population could be housed in a megacity the size of Texas. We don't need _that_ much space. But we need cheap products to keep our markets afloat...
t1_ducr955	0.381800	*	Also, the US have no intelligence assets in China, and hasn't had any since the 2010 [purge](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/05/20/world/asia/china-cia-spies-espionage.html)

t1_dv1mozu	0.077200	*	The world is a better place if all people work together, this was a step away from that. Nationalism is embarrassing.
t1_dubqbgs	0.757900	*	There are definitely websites out there.  I think my account was worth approximately $200 or so, based on the market at the time.  Post karma is better than comment karma.

t1_dugwi5o	0.361200	*	Manafort was Trump's campaign manager...  Does that seem like the relationship between CEO and random cashiers? You're being intentionally obtuse
t1_duzzzgc	-0.222000	*	Whoa hold up. I wasn't accusing you of anything, I was adding to your point. Everyone put the pitchforks down :/
t1_dui75mw	-0.153100	*	I guess that depends on what you consider poor. Neither Barack Obama nor Bill Clinton came from wealthy backgrounds. 
t1_duy5azt	0.000000	*	Last I saw Scott Stapp was off chasing the dragon and begging for money on youtube, after being kicked out of his own band.
t1_dupmvj4	0.000000	*	You don't need to account for state spending. The Fed. gov spends half of its discretionary spending on the military, but only spends 20%~ of its total expenditure on the military. 
t1_duyl5pq	0.354400	*	Fair and square? Come on man, that's just not true. So many independent government agencies all agree there was tampering in the election.

t1_dv2f52m	0.421500	*	Yeah FTTP works, but FTTN is outdated tech on top of using cables and copper pairs which are decades old and need replacing anyway.
t1_dv4zawv	0.199900	*	It's funny how often these anonymous sources turn out to be real.  Anonymous sources, btw, means it's anonymous to you, not the author. It's not like they get their info from people on Twitter.

t1_dunbu7s	0.296000	*	Yeah, you can. Millions do. Take the bus. 
t1_dufyrbs	-0.526700	*	That's not analogous. I can feasibly still use my own skills to avoid the teenage texters. I cannot do anything to avoid a mountain unless I am flying the plane.
t1_dujl6st	0.458800	*	I love the idea of Trump debating some random person, and he cant say anything, because he literally has no idea who this person is.
t1_duur3u4	0.226300	*	It's literally impossible since he'd have to be an MP first. That stops populist demagogue figures like Farage getting into parliament in the first place.

t1_dudp214	-0.318200	*	It's not a goal anymore, it's already achieved. The US lost a lot of its reputation under Trump.

t1_duqxhlm	-0.505900	*	Don't. Just...don't. You and I both know that's just so fucking insane it might happen.
t1_dv06lqj	0.520400	*	Where is right for retribution even coming from? Who's saying this outside of the thread? I'm asking because I honestly don't know.
t1_duthfx5	0.340000	*	Luxury stores open there because they know people value luxuries there, which is the very opposite of what communism ideology is.

t1_duzjvsu	0.361200	*	sounds like the NRA
t1_dv1x2cs	0.000000	*	You still have to go into work for 40 hours a week. Averaging it out over a year does not change that fact. 
t1_duexwc0	0.000000	*	America's prone to waxing and waning extremism.  There's always going to be the potential for what we've seen these past 2 years just because our population is so diverse. 
t1_dul9meu	0.000000	*	xcardxf4gxe2xf1
t1_duxpcsp	0.154000	*	Yeah, it's kind of like T_D lite. Not as toxic, but there's an underlying tone.   I find Canada in general isn't quite as partisan, but it's definitely getting worse. 
t1_dua6c5o	0.568800	*	I am talking about the article, you made up the rest for yourself.  So its okay to post clickbait and false information as long as it supports your cause?
t1_dujsak4	0.164500	*	then you are mistaken, i would place a bet that we don't see a world war in our lifetimes.
t1_dv3fk9b	-0.463900	*	Yes and there are paid agitators from every nation that do this stuff at every election. But you dont care because you have some seeded bigotry against Russians

t1_dv33va7	0.372400	*	Thank you I had no clue. Fucking Russia Racism and Guns is all the news talks about so stuff like this is easy to miss. I reckon that's not an accident.
t1_dujzrt3	0.578200	*	I don't like making generalizations, but this one seems pretty accurate.
t1_duia1ft	-0.690800	*	I could walk a million miles in their shoes, they'd kill themselves after walking 3 feet in mine.

t1_duna5zf	0.000000	*	What? You are aware that there are takeout containers made of only paper (biodegradable), made to be recycled? Why wouldn't you be able to make a straw of the same material?
t1_duoutju	-0.419900	*	As you can see Rob, u/ARealBillsFan has laid the golden trap, lets give it a few and see if a kind Redditor bites!
t1_dv336k2	0.000000	*	How do people turn 'Russian interference' into 'Russia owns Trump'?
t1_dunm5mm	0.636900	*	I would love to visit Pakistan - I have this thing for the art/crafts (not to mention foods) of the 'stans generally. But (a) I'm a woman and (b) even if I were a man - nope.
t1_dv0rtxa	-0.393900	*	And you know this how? Was the nation asked again? There is plenty of people out there who are still anti EU.
t1_duaaal5	-0.273200	*	Also, even when you make a real attempt at research, there's about 10 conflicting stories for everything and you have no idea which is supposed to be true.

t1_dv3g0m4	0.418400	*	Yeah, exactly! A sibboleth!  \>_>  <_<
t1_dusz7eg	-0.790600	*	> always check the history: need to know if it's one of the russians currently raping your country before I reply  The source of the argument is irrelevant for the merit of the argument.
t1_duk7on7	0.852500	*	No. New treas are far more efficient at gathering green house gases.   A fully mature tree doesn't do much.   I forget the exact measure, but 1 new tree is worth dozens of fully mature ones. 
t1_dv0mld8	0.000000	*	Unlikely - rwanda actually has food

t1_duplkjg	0.421500	*	Trump hopes to watch the American people feel the trickle down.
t1_dum6aye	-0.476700	*	False. They are not state sponsored and actually issue corrections when they get facts wrong. RT is a media arm of a government. Very different.

t1_dujkz5a	0.000000	*	Twin Bushes 
t1_duhx2ov	-0.644000	*	So you're saying that abolishing Europe's borders, as the EU did, had no effect on where industries located themselves?   Do you think economic theory backs up that argument?
t1_duudwxe	-0.051600	*	Thats why the Iranians and Chinese have invested so heavily in missiles. Turning threats into opportunities. 
t1_duq8bh9	-0.415500	*	Sanctions that would have otherwise been in place have been stopped, which is something they wanted, seems very clear to me, not sure why you are struggling with it.
t1_dud6xu4	-0.265100	*	This is an extremely good point. It just so obvious that anyone sucked into voting for trump since Bernie didn't make it was not following any values.
t1_dunmw93	-0.421500	*	I think anything we can do to limit the possibility that a minor can kill and wound more people than years he has existed on earth, is a good thing. 
t1_duylaoc	0.492600	*	But Trump.  What a charmer!
t1_dusk6ft	-0.140600	*	Right moist is not all over horrible  ,And you're right it seems liveable, especially for bacterial life. The word, testy sounds like prickly and itchy generally undesirable.
t1_duiazx5	-0.545900	*	So, you've got no evidence at all? You're just bullshitting? That's a shame, I thought you might actually have something of value to offer.

t1_dv3bju4	0.759100	*	Aren't electoral college votes based on population? Then how would any state be any more powerful than another more populous one? Lol
t1_dum6nlr	0.273200	*	Agreed. 
t1_duvzn5d	-0.077200	*	What's your proposal? I've detailed my proposal in this thread in full. Emissions will grow regardless of harsh power / transportation regulation simply based upon population growth.

t1_duidabv	0.000000	*	Workers of the world unite!
t1_duhvx99	-0.440400	*	Unemployed adults that are not seeking employment are not included in the unemployment statistics iirc. So non-working spouses are not included in that statistic
t1_dut0vp6	0.578900	*	Both sides have a lot to lose, but China stands to gain something in the process. I actually think Trump is more likely to take on China than, say, Obama.
t1_duztumd	0.906200	*	Those would probably be the best ones, yeah.  Their and our(German here) intelligence agencies might just be powerful enough to get them out of that jail in the first place.
t1_duqtfkl	-0.526700	*	Why do you assume those complaining don't understand it? I understand the system, and disagree with it. 
t1_duynhvw	-0.316400	*	>Yeah, shit man, I would love to fail upwards like that.  All you need is a $14 million loan and access to several trust funds from your father, and a $150 million inheritance when your parents die!

t1_dutcakc	0.000000	*	How's mongolia?
t1_dv38a9j	-0.381800	*	When Bernie lost the primary there was switch; as there always is. Ideal candidate to least of evils.

t1_duq6act	-0.320800	*	*Muslim antisemitism. I have a rational fear of Islam, not a phobic one. 
t1_ducdgvt	-0.025800	*	But they also needed Germany as a bulwark against the Warsaw Pact, so that doesn't hold up either.
t1_dv2hp3m	-0.854000	*	Obama tripled the DOW and brought us back from a recession. Unemployment went from 9% when he took office to 4% when he left.   I'm sorry reality doesn't support your right wing ignorant narrative.

t1_dv1m3od	0.361200	*	>How to hunt drug users and traffickers   Well that's a good thing to me    Also I doubt all the UN is doing in syria is training police against drug traffickers....

t1_dusjlp5	0.077200	*	We could analyze the number of times it pulls from sources and them see how the sources rank based on 2-3 different rated charts that have ranked sources from left to right.
t1_duef80e	-0.104500	*	You mean the formation of a new polymorph, not increased stability of an existing one?  It's a one-in-a trillion event that occurs during normal crystallization, but only extremely rarely.

t1_dv02zhq	-0.601000	*	Literally no one is justifying anything. They're just pointing out the fact that two different things aren't the same. Stop trying to sensationalize shit.
t1_duejryq	0.542300	*	Pretty much, yeah. IIRC things like that make it a lot easier to kick people out of the country if caught since they can retroactively deny their visa due to fraud.

t1_duvtgkz	0.361200	*	Thing to remember is China has had the #1 spot for like less than a decade.  The US held the #1 spot for nearly 100 years before that.  So, pot, kettle, black, etc.

t1_duscfvo	0.361200	*	Its somewhat accurate. He implied americans and didnt use yanks.  But I personally find it quite unlikely, that real guys would talk like that to a stranger, who would record them.

t1_dujuwd3	-0.028400	*	Our two parties are dividing themselves to the point that we now can't agree on anything. So much being done simply just to spite the other party

t1_duyv0mw	0.421500	*	Exactly - apparently we're the Texas of Europe? lol. It's an issue because it's the EU pushing it, if it were an initiative of our own goverment, it wouldn't be such a controversy in my opinion. 
t1_dum26pn	0.921700	*	Well there's not much we can say is the people are happy with their leader. I know the cultural differences are pretty different in Philippines compared to here. Both love their guns though.

t1_duljevk	0.648600	*	They only need to gain in 1-2 areas for the entire venture to be worth it and that is the point.    Also saying it is Russia when what we really mean is the Russian Mob/Oligarchs. 
t1_dv2yf8d	0.931600	*	Just like any award (Oscar, Emmy, Grammy etc) it doesn't mean shit and has nothing to do with the quality of the actor or the good doings of a politician, it's primarily a popularity thing.

t1_duq72sw	0.826900	*	Is it not better for Russia that Trump has delayed placing sanctions on them that would currently be in place had Clinton won?  Seems like a pretty clear answer to that one.

t1_dv2mvod	0.340000	*	Every game I've played, the protestants immediately get their asses kicked. I think maybe that is something a future patch will have to address.

t1_dufm3by	-0.318200	*	One thing I learned is that on Reddit, any topic is joke material.  Even if it's a bad idea.

t1_duiaq7t	0.499000	*	It's both, I think. They're not mutually exclusive, though I may be incorrect. It seems reasonable & meritocratic to acknowledge that certain people have unearned advantages from their starting point.
t1_duk25st	-0.381800	*	Yikes, this is embarrassing 
t1_dutm1cv	-0.309400	*	But you see? It's stopped raining. Why do we need our umbrellas? Lets burn them all.

t1_ducgags	0.493900	*	What a broad statement. You can pretty much say that about any country.   The point is the US fd them over multiple times by destabilizing their government when they had stability.

t1_dusdt0i	-0.930000	*	I do not trust our electorate anymore at all.  Greed, stupidity, sexism and racism are apparently our national values.  Expect the worst.

t1_due8111	-0.296000	*	I'd be interested in sources on mocking veterans, if anyone has them.   Not to doubt you, just want for future discussions.

t1_duhzt1d	0.381800	*	Idt I'd accept any exemption for Russian athletes atm
t1_dv2avfw	-0.790600	*	So essentially Trump is starting a trade war which hurts all Americans except steel workers?

t1_dugahjk	-0.458800	*	You are right about the US. The US government is hypocritical too. Especially when it comes to brown Mexicans, who are more native to the Americas than any white person. 
t1_dubn73q	0.223500	*	People will call slightly less left people nazi sympathisers. Don't underestimate how batshit the alt-left is.

t1_dueejsx	0.440400	*	I meant, how do you write the macro. How do we describe what we're looking for? We would be searching very large areas I think. More than an analysis could effectively search manually.
t1_duf93ua	0.361200	*	Like what?
t1_dui9t34	0.000000	*	What else did we do that didnt require money?

t1_durisj3	0.000000	*	Amendedment and right are two very diffrent things. 
t1_dupp0wx	-0.746100	*	The right? You're not even going to try and disguise it by saying alt-right or some such term?  Just a blanket condemnation of conservative political ideas altogether?

t1_dupia7b	-0.102700	*	The explicit stat is important.   Someone working *the exact same job* can expect to earn half of their US counterpart.   Mexico has a very different job market making wages a lot lower on average.

t1_duiali4	-0.636900	*	Your payment to property tax isnt a 1 to 1 coverage of police and fire. Its another avenue of revenue to cover police and fire, not a sole source.   So you have to pay more taxes. 
t1_duvf95a	0.439700	*	It's not that they hate the environment, it's more that they hate brown people and if the environment suffers because of that, it is an acceptable loss

t1_duqt466	0.316700	*	Okay that makes more sense.  Still quite silly to not know how PDF conversion works though. A software practically dies it for you

t1_dudzb7c	0.680800	*	Its a bit like religion and determinism. If you do X, Y, Z to get into heaven. God gave you free will, so you have a choice whether to not do X, Y and Z and burn in hell.

t1_duxn2dq	0.401900	*	Seek help, dude
t1_dult5eg	-0.476700	*	Usury is neocolonialism. Exorbitant return on investment removed from the local economy is neocolonialism. Keep up, dipshit. 
t1_dv4b0jw	0.556200	*	Today you get to learn that things can be described multiple ways, and people often get done in covering up crimes rather than the actual crimes. Hooray for you!

t1_dui5co6	0.153100	*	My free tax software had me roll my investment losses from 2016 onto my 2017 taxes. That $3,000 had a much bigger impact on my overall tax rate than it would on a billionaire

t1_dv2o3m0	-0.557400	*	In a real democracy we'd have more than 2 fucking candidates. Also clinton completely colluded against sanders. Imagine if it was sanders vs. trumps dumbass.

t1_duwc0j6	-0.431700	*	Unpredictability almost killed us a while back. We survived, yes, but do you prefer a better life for 7.6 billion people, or a catastrophe with 1 billion survivors?

t1_dur3jsg	0.143100	*	Agree with me? I didnt take a side so what are they agreeing with here? This is such a poisonous response, assuming so much.

t1_dv25qcz	-0.644000	*	Maybe he's being blackmailed into destroying Americas economy? Maybe this is Putins way of getting back at the sanctions imposed on Russia?

t1_duj593p	-0.153100	*	Your original comment didn't mention anything about the US. It was just talking about gay districts in Russia and it came off as an attempt to brush off criticism.

t1_dum1g3b	-0.722700	*	I do think that the superdelegate system is outdated. It had a purpose back when it was made, but now all it does is give people something to blame their loss on that isn't him getting less votes.

t1_dv3nthl	-0.807400	*	As long as you have a valid argument you usually won't get downvoted too hard. The difference comes in with how much leniency liberal arguments get. Conservative arguments need to be water tight.

t1_duxkneh	-0.438600	*	It is! However, many women may not feel chest pain or pressure at all during a heart attack and instead will show other symptoms. 
t1_dugqrsx	-0.421500	*	Snap election isn't the right word then. I just know that there when the government fails to pass a budget, the whole government gets dissolved and an election is called to replace everybody.

t1_duvwnld	0.648600	*	Huh, interesting. I imagine we do a weekly/monthly rate since in my time working there I've only seen them sent back once. What are the benefits to renting them besides not having to store them?
t1_duqxitu	-0.214400	*	Why is it conservatives who believe the stupid shit like this 99% of the time lol. There's the occasional hippy liberal anti-vax mom but still.

t1_duq8oa2	0.802300	*	> We're not some magic gods the world loves  Doesn't it not matter if they love us or not? Isnt our importance both in power and economy what keeps us at the center?
t1_dumj4yd	0.773600	*	>The US government doesn't care about the ideology of other nations, only how well they serve their economic/geopolitical interests.   So pretty much like every nation in history.  
t1_duizm11	0.401900	*	I meant more - everyone who had a control over the decision. The Germans and French definitely knew the Greek info was incorrect and still allowed the in to the monetary union.

t1_dv4cefe	-0.275500	*	A flashbang is far less harmful than a fragmentation grenade, obviously, but it is also not harmless.

t1_dv1f0vg	-0.438900	*	Dude, stop trying! History tells that Republican governments are always a plague on the economy. That is a fact. You seriously sound like you're gas lighting for no reason right now. 
t1_duco1cm	-0.599400	*	I was drinking a 16 oz coffee during every class in college. Now if I have more than 1-2 cups in the morning I feel like I am having a panic attack all day.

t1_ducve84	-0.308900	*	He said the indictment doesn't make that claim.   He didn't say the special counsels office in general isn't making that claim.   
t1_dv0puc6	-0.530300	*	It's just liberal propaganda.  Trump and most gun owners support reasonable gun control legislation.

t1_dutn0kh	-0.361200	*	It is. I swear EVERYONE got it and a lot of my coworkers got sent to the hospital. My dumbass is still too scared of needles to get it. I hear the shot only helps 30%, which for many helps a lot.

t1_dui39zn	0.340000	*	It's only flexibility if you can choose your hours. Otherwise it's just being permanently on call without getting paid for it.

t1_dupo3in	0.000000	*	That's not why Turks aren't Arabs. They are two separate groups that speak two unrelated languages.

t1_duoijvz	-0.786900	*	And it's not like gang members are born with a criminal record. Or have friends/family without records.   Buy gun, remove SN, claim gun is lost or stolen, give to gangbanger nephew.

t1_e3439xf	0.000000	*	Are you saying what I think you're saying? So everyone uses memes from t_d shares them all over reddit. But the memes were all made by Russian bots. So without Russian bots there would be no reddit?

t1_durfhlz	0.287800	*	So whats the legal definition of enemy of the United States? It seems like a declaration of war, or being a recognized nation, isnt really necessary.
t1_duyyt22	-0.381800	*	It's not just the ins. co's, it's also big pharma. If drug and device prices were lower, then ins. would need to pay less, and therefore they would (ideally) charge less.

t1_dugv0m6	0.872000	*	Because Trump won Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, he didn't even need Florida to win, however. He still would have won had he lost Florida or Ohio, one or the other.

t1_dunkyps	0.273200	*	Well that's part of it. The other part is that he doesn't dare let his arms fall to his sides because...his entire fucking life could be circling the drain.
t1_dv0rftr	0.711900	*	If I didn't have family here I didn't want to leave I'd seriously consider it.  I feel like a foreigner here anyway, might as well feel it somewhere I can respect.
t1_dujal2f	-0.051600	*	not what i said, the person i was commenting on was making it seem like a US only problem, it's universally flawed since every system is subject to corruption

t1_duv149e	-0.845000	*	Imagine being so scared you base your entire voting record on keeping your guns.  Not healthcare, education, taxes, or war - but keeping your high capacity firearms.  That's what fear does to people.

t1_dv2k14j	0.318200	*	You're making a huge assumption about the 2018 midterms.
t1_dufz47d	0.440400	*	It doesn't show any trends over time.  The poster above you said that Germany is well on their way to reaching the 2% goal by 2024.  Your link doesn't say anything about that.

t1_duieth5	0.700300	*	I agree with you. But that's not on Congress. Puerto Ricans should make a clear decision. Truthfully, I suspect that Puerto Rico has forged too much of a national identity to become just a state. 
t1_dup9rr1	-0.542300	*	When money equals power capitalism is bound to fail the people 
t1_duajdi6	-0.498600	*	oh definitely not. Im just pretty sick of this talk about X, bring up Y out of nowhere argumentation.

t1_dv53mv0	0.458800	*	I'm not implying that at all. I'm pointing out the complexities of Russia's defense of its core territory which are greater than that of the USA.

t1_dv28hca	0.709600	*	Thanks for that :)

t1_dudx2c3	0.000000	*	Regulation and Patent Law are two different things.
t1_dubel9g	0.000000	*	You're right. They would just send him to the Gulag, bulldoze his house, and build a hideous concrete apartment building in its place.

t1_duck78t	0.128000	*	We could provide our own justice. We dont have to rely on another power to dispense this. If Russia didnt have America to worry about, europe would be speaking slavic by now.

t1_dv0iwvv	-0.192100	*	You haven't convinced me that diesels are safe, just that some petrol engines are just as bad.  Diesel is a definite human carinogen, as classified by the WHO.

t1_duxidt3	0.000000	*	Not anymore
t1_dubhtqw	0.128000	*	Yes I'm a shill because I truly believe Trump and the gop are vile people. I think you don't know what a shill means

t1_dusj5dd	0.817600	*	I feel like the media is potraying alot of this...  It's hard to trust the media when they constantly push agendas.  But I don't think at any time anyone trusted the media
t1_dv3lwbt	-0.471700	*	YouTube and Facebook are taking things down that are simply not a liberal view.  That isn't cool, whether or not you agree with the content that is being removed.  
t1_duzxyv3	-0.258500	*	Thats a little backwards, considering no water solves the lack of food in a matter of days.
t1_dv4wi93	-0.051600	*	Have you got a source to back that particuliar claim up? To say that journalistic integrity is dead because they print things you dont like is asinine.

t1_dud6tlf	0.894500	*	It's inaccurate, yes. There are some energy drinks that are stronger than an average cup of coffee, but a strong cup of coffee easily beats everything (except taking a bunch of caffeine pills).
t1_dugc4fs	0.802400	*	With a border that big the costs of sustaining the sort of security necessary to make it effective would outweigh the benefit for the country as a whole by several-fold.

t1_dura456	0.361200	*	I consider it barely any when a country the size of the USA takes less refugees than Switzerland and brags about it. And I'd say it starts being a lot when you do it like Germany and take in millions.

t1_dus2r6a	0.223500	*	That's untrue.   The neighboring countries that aren't total shitheads welcomed an enormous amount of refugees. The amount of refugees held by the rest of the world isn't even nearly comparable.

t1_duejiep	-0.854200	*	Actually I think I read on reddit that females outnumber males in Russia.  Most Russian men die from vodka and are abusive hence why there's a lot of Russian mail order brides.

t1_dv67u9s	0.025800	*	If it was just cheap labor they would not have tariffs. And they would have laws that prevent you from selling in China without manufacturing in China.

t1_dugqlae	0.202300	*	How smug and elitist of you to say. People who vote differently from me are uneducated and mean. 
t1_duo4c0c	-0.372900	*	> The reason I don't see eye to eye with you is you are basically an extremist   Lol. You totally lost the argument.
t1_duhat0e	-0.261700	*	The meaning of enemies (in the treason code) is arguable, but it's pretty clear that once Russia attacked us they were an active enemy, same as if they'd bombed Pearl Harbor. So...

t1_dv1yslh	-0.401900	*	As long as Trump stays racist AF and brings suffering to black and brown people, they will accept ANYTHING from him.  They will only turn on him if he starts being nice to black folks and Mexicans.  
t1_dush76j	0.128000	*	Let's be clear it's speaking sense because the Thalmor should never have been allowed here and even if they were I still slaughter them at will, no matter what the White-Gold Concordat says. 
t1_duaj7bh	0.585900	*	Fair enough. I can agree with that.
t1_duzx29o	-0.202300	*	They were rich because they were white too. Systematically oppressing and killing other racial groups for a few decades will generally do that. 
t1_dv0dfv3	-0.271700	*	Yeah, its almost like apartheid made some people angry.  It may not be a great situation, but you reap what you sow.

t1_durn6hf	-0.680800	*	Have you ever checked the definition of terrorism?
t1_dup9zid	0.401900	*	Yes, China has that too. Everything is tied to IDs or passports if you're a foreigner. 
t1_dud9f7d	-0.177900	*	That's weird, some shady BS must be going on behind the scenes, unless they somehow stepped up their game recently.

t1_dumlqqw	-0.367800	*	Yeah man, just like it's not up to the president to start a war. We call it police actions when congress hasn't approved it. 
t1_dui3au2	0.653800	*	Never had a twizzler with a milkshake. Sounds really good, but it would take me like 10 years to get through it.

t1_duzfoo5	0.688700	*	There are 5M+ NRA members. It's safe to say most would agree with me on that one.
t1_dup029p	0.525600	*	Lots of historical pragmstism to find. Recognizing a state run genocide is extremely important. Did a state actively hunt down muslims?

t1_dv0w09f	-0.683800	*	An expert whos unable to persuade is useless. Persuasion is what gets results. Its dirty and relies on emotion. Incredibly frustrating to intelligent people.

t1_duhkabi	0.273200	*	Ah. Gotcha.   Maybe I'm overly optimistic but I think the 4 or so years this administration will use to negate global warming will force the next administration to take a serious look at policies.

t1_dv1nbpu	0.000000	*	you have a cross-dressing appeaser instead?

t1_dupgn9g	0.390700	*	no one is anti german but they both kinda lost the privilege of having large standing armies, thats why there is still active US bases in both countries.
t1_dui1ofe	0.644000	*	Is that really official policy? It certainly does happen. But official policy? I'd like to see some proof about that.
t1_duhuo6j	-0.624900	*	Yeah. Every account on r/worldnews is a robot bought by the PAP to scam gullible voters in Singapore. There's no such thing as any actual PAP supporter online. /s

t1_dunfll7	0.400300	*	They certainly would've mine!

t1_dv0rhyu	-0.400500	*	Just because you disagree with someone politically, doesn't mean they are unriable.  Your intellectual dishonesty is really sad. You are a small man.
t1_dv3azah	0.190100	*	Thank you for the explanation, but I was more asking about Reddit's warrant canary in particular. What happened with it?
t1_duwxmke	0.504000	*	Exactly my point.  Unfit to work is better than not working??

t1_dudguo7	0.695600	*	Maybe, but that leaves two outcomes. Either they're criminal or idiots. Neither seems like a great trait I'd want with people running the country.

t1_dutqyvi	0.000000	*	It is tastier cooked though.
t1_dujshqi	-0.526700	*	It's literally the counterpart of the argument that liberal protesters are paid by Soros. Neither side can fathom that there's actually people on the other side who genuinely believe what they do. 
t1_dunbzwv	0.000000	*	Baseball is national sport. 
t1_dv5fst0	0.421500	*	Except it does and is. Youre just afraid of people that dont look like you. Which is pretty weak.
t1_dusvhcs	0.419500	*	Sure, I can see that he's been doing some significant consolidation of power, I just meant that the removal of the term limit doesn't seem like the cause of a significant change in itself.
t1_dv27ptp	-0.460100	*	The US steel industry can't even come close to meeting demand. So yes, this is a dumb, short-sighted move.
t1_dufkcn8	-0.643200	*	Do you know what a talking point is?  Also no, they havent proposed more gun control, I dont think they should... how are you it getting this?

t1_ducvd9i	0.361200	*	sounds like something an advertiser for a non main subreddit might say. *I'm on to you*
t1_dur8ruu	-0.526700	*	I changed nothing. The Khmer Rouge government of Cambodia was socialist.  The CIA and Thatchers UK did not back them. You are beyond stupid.
t1_duhjgvt	-0.557400	*	The courts decide who are monopolies, and who aren't. They also decide who abuses their monopoly status, as they should.

t1_dujamy4	-0.836000	*	> So the message is bad, but it's pretty well-made.   That makes it extra horrifying for those who own teeth very fitting for a curb in ~~Soviet Russia~~ shit hole Russia.

t1_dussqbj	-0.024000	*	If Australia had 15x the amount of shooting they currently have, you could probably fit all of them into 1 week in the US. You guys are fucking nuts about guns.
t1_durkw71	-0.102700	*	Hm, fair enough. I'm not an expert by any means. I just recall reading a lot of articles where South Korea gets in fights with the Japanese government over their textbooks.
t1_duae9uf	0.612400	*	A bit like when Obama promised us we'd be at the back of the queue when it came to an American trade deal?
t1_dv2l0ws	-0.275500	*	... I know D. Trump (through NRA). A decent person.  Personally, that doesn't sound like he's referring to a publicly available speech.

t1_dv15tg7	0.000000	*	Then link to one.
t1_duibgkp	-0.468100	*	No. It wouldn't hurt everyone, because if you keep the total tax amount the same, taxing assets allows you to tax the rich much more than the poor, thus you could lower taxes on the poor. 
t1_duhh0ad	0.000000	*	And they said I'll never have that beach front property in Nevada.

t1_duuse0n	0.071100	*	Sadly, that varies and depends on habituation, just because it does not hurt does not mean its not harmful.  And a lot of negatives in that sentence. 
t1_dudx1az	0.000000	*	Diskannehcting faerar foal  Is basically the new civic
t1_duhskfa	0.361200	*	I agree 99% of the time. That 1% is when heavy metals are involved. They ain't going nowhere.

t1_dujjgvj	-0.381800	*	Though different from the phone plastic thing, very few people eventually become annoyed by their foreskin and chop it off later
t1_dumihdh	0.564700	*	Heading that way soon means you admit that it's not as bad?
t1_dunyub6	-0.273200	*	Yes, but you disagreed. The only way any person could have a differing opinion is if they were paid to do so. Duh...
t1_dur2b2t	-0.296000	*	Under communism the state wouldn't exist, there would be no dictator telling people what to do.

t1_dua4wmp	0.051600	*	Why would they be interested in the views of actual Japanese people?   You're not, after all - you just want to be told what you want to hear. Sad.
t1_duspbm1	-0.557400	*	They have a blanket ban on bots apparently.
t1_dv0wfzc	0.690800	*	Because it is. Our best case scenario is an economic drop and slow in growth. All govt/EU reports done so far achnowledge this.
t1_duj52cb	-0.223500	*	So being a slave with gags and leashes, wearing latex and leather link outfits while performing sex acts in public is not debauchery? Ok then
t1_dv6via2	0.039700	*	It seems you have internet. Learn a programming language and then keep learning as you go. You won't be poor for long. Or if you are, you can at least blame yourself.

t1_dujjogb	-0.863800	*	How about within the US though? You expect the proportion of the people in the prison system to be representative of the same % of ethnicities which make up the US? Or is your logic piss poor?
t1_dv48qh1	-0.340000	*	Doubtful. The Kawasaki H2R does about 400km/h max. Would depends on the aerodynamic profile though.

t1_duhg6uc	0.440400	*	They dont want people getting in shape, they see you doing even a push-up you will get a reprimanded or take away privileges.
t1_dudxy7z	0.624900	*	Well we use grand for a thousand. Because a thousand used to be a lot of money in 1915 (when the term started)
t1_dv4i96x	-0.072700	*	And again *I don't support bans.* I think there are more effective answers to these problems, but bans *do seem to work, at least in some nations.*

t1_dupp722	-0.200600	*	It's a bit more rigid in Japan. Man goes to work, gives all the money to wife, money goes into her account(no joint accounts in Japan), and wife gives husband an allowance to live on.

t1_dud4f42	-0.922500	*	> anyone who disagrees with me is a conspiracy minded idiot!!  Que? People who believe and proliferate idiotic things without evidence are idiots, doesn't much matter what the underlying ideology is.
t1_dunah7u	0.273200	*	It's not mind-boggling, it's what a Russian puppet would do and Trump tries hard everyday to look like one.   
t1_dv2yet0	0.931600	*	Just like any award (Oscar, Emmy, Grammy etc) it doesn't mean shit and has nothing to do with the quality of the actor or the good doings of a politician, it's primarily a popularity thing. 
t1_dv0w547	0.000000	*	may hap.  I mean the guy is a D-Bag, but spreading false facts/news is still not an appropriate way to handle something.
t1_dubdhv6	-0.202300	*	I disagree, though I will say they are better at playing the dirty games that makes it seem this way
t1_dup823n	0.205700	*	It's Jesodes, and since i'm not an ignorant slob, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/7blt7j/the_plural_of_octopus/)

t1_dugoobz	0.624900	*	Except  there is no practically imaginable scenario on Earth where they're actually successful. This would be like, What if my high school shooting team took over the White House?
t1_dv032ls	0.735100	*	Great training for the zombie apocalypse. American school kids will be well trained when it comes.
t1_duobk7e	0.000000	*	The Prophet had nothing against her business.  He used that money to fund his proselytizing.
t1_dv2jhfw	-0.599400	*	Poland had one of the highest percentage Jewish populations prior to the war. You be the judge.
t1_dul3xv1	0.338200	*	Well, look at that. 100 million people with different opinions!
t1_duqth2r	-0.510600	*	His sf-86 shenanigans would have gotten other people thrown in prison.
t1_duyw6n4	-0.352700	*	Is Obama the one that is supposed to bring charges? Or would it be the responsibility of some other government agency?
t1_dv1tu49	0.153100	*	Who gives a shit. Kazakistan is the greatest producer of potassium in the whole world. All other countries are run by little girls.
t1_dukz5g1	0.381800	*	If you have moral integrity you quit
t1_duroe58	-0.190100	*	Your account would definitely be worth a far few hundred bucks for sure, but sadly that would be on RS3 - all the main trading now is Old school RuneScape and  it has the largest player base 
t1_dv64b9q	0.779100	*	0.28Mbps? I laughed, I'm sorry. It's actually impressive because in most countries you couldn't get those speeds even if you tried because the speeds don't go that low.
t1_dufl1ui	-0.318200	*	How about a lack of arable land leading to starvation on a mass scale?
t1_duof0t2	0.631000	*	Don't you mean in return for compulsory service?  I'd be happy if the USA adopted Swiss gun laws wholesale. They're not that bad.
t1_dultyyu	-0.812200	*	Your second citation conflicts pretty heavily with your first one, the second one only counts 1000 or so dead from coalition strikes.
t1_dumg33n	-0.051600	*	Eh, they're being annihaletd on YT and other social media. There's no chance they get more than 10%. Not with the new candidate anyway
t1_duynv4l	0.000000	*	This isnt Canada.
t1_dusrv4y	0.458800	*	Im a 2 dimensional being and a fellow line segment just laughed at you.

t1_duspj6y	0.273200	*	The problem isn't their opinion of Americans, though, but convincing them that there won't be another Trump in the future. Which is hard, since there could absolutely be another one.
t1_dv0jlr3	-0.296000	*	yea, no  that's a strawman 
t1_duncdio	-0.372400	*	It's not that it's beneath them (maybe they also don't respect her because she's a woman, who knows). It's seen as inappropriate for people to touch members of the opposite sex unless they are family.
t1_dv016w3	-0.855500	*	People dont take bathtubs to schools to drown people or fire them out of hotel windows at crowds, your analogy is dumb.
t1_dv02wt0	-0.705400	*	Yes Africa needs a lot more foreign investment for development, but these internal conflicts, and corruption prevents it. The Chinese are corrupt as hell too so maybe they'd fit right in there.   
t1_dupg0uv	0.000000	*	Religion is *part* of culture.
t1_dv37t08	-0.144000	*	I wouldnt be surprised if Reddit admins are worried about this and allow more alt right shit to flourish here to help sway the election. 
t1_dudtnn9	0.000000	*	It's probably the B Vitamins. 
t1_dunc83e	-0.670500	*	My wife quickly learned that was a losing option. She'd starve if she had to rely on that. Instead we just get her leftovers to go for her lunch the next day. 
t1_duro69b	-0.150100	*	You want to know the real kicker? Its not a joke. This is what he was alleged to have done with the porn star that he paid off.
t1_duyk1m7	-0.186800	*	> Being compromised by a foreign government is hardly an impeachable offense  /s or /r? 
t1_duttw08	-0.153100	*	Yup, have some kids then interact with these dumbasses who don't vaccinate. Those who actively endanger your kids due to their stupidity. We'll see how cordial you feel then
t1_dulcmv3	0.000000	*	You should also realize that living conditions in the Philippines is way different from where you live. 
t1_dv48s1i	-0.492700	*	That sounds extremely painful.

t1_dupwx63	0.296000	*	Why? Because they're a necessary part of modern warfare. A proper army requires armored vehicles that are capable of withstanding significant amounts of firepower and able to deal back similarly.

t1_duuzmwj	0.000000	*	Maybe it's because I'm on mobile, but the only links I see are to Trump's Twitter page. Does anyone on desktop see links?

t1_dusuwvd	0.000000	*	Why would you assume that people programming these bots are leftist?
t1_duok0na	-0.421500	*	Revelation is just full of metaphor. Sadly people do not realise this and take that part of the Bible literally to.

t1_dupnqvm	0.737800	*	Interesting. I wonder why Americans are pushing so hard against an immigration policy like this. Unless the US has a better system?

t1_duf9rz5	-0.827100	*	I hate that quote. It's basically calling poor people with ambitions idiots. It enforces a victim hood mentality where escaping your class is impossible, so we should instead try to change the system.
t1_dv0r7aj	-0.340000	*	Signing does not mean they actually enforce it, just like the US signed the UN convention against torture, and does not enforce it.

t1_duqeevd	-0.502300	*	Okay, but let's admit that the TTPP was a piece of shit?

t1_dud15s9	0.540400	*	Its not the medias fault. Most people barely pay attention yet love to fight. 
t1_duqupte	0.361200	*	Sounds like your understanding of the Russian soul is based on George W. Bush's 'reading' of Putin's soul. Dubya was on his game that day.

t1_duyw5wn	0.128000	*	Yes, when people had more skill and more abundance animals to access. We're in the middle of a mass extinction event and no one knows anything relevant. 
t1_dui1sun	-0.102700	*	China will pay for the roads and the drivers. If China wants the product, China will get the product.
t1_duh6fk8	0.604100	*	More effective at governing yes, but less effective at getting a Democrat into the president's office. As it stands now Sanders and basically every non GOP Congress person is useless.
t1_dui7djy	-0.102700	*	> If he thinks he isn't taxed enough, he can just pay more and quit speaking for everyone else.  You're almost there. He thinks *billionaires*, of which he is one, aren't taxed enough.

t1_duk9qn7	0.000000	*	Was that person called Jacob Rees-Mogg?

t1_dudqgo9	0.000000	*	fed up with bigots but posts a comment filled with bigotry.
t1_dutt220	0.446600	*	Tibet was literally a secession. I don't see any countries on earth being OK with secession.
t1_dundh3g	0.273200	*	I don't quite follow you. Factually Trump agreed or in the very least echoed the sentiments said by some of the parents in regards to teachers having guns.
t1_dubnsix	-0.722700	*	Not just that but Momentum's online tactics seem rather familiar. I suspect they're using the same playbook rather than being part of the whole mess.
t1_dumasww	-0.476700	*	> But hey, just repeat your lies until you have proven Joseph Goebbels right... it would make him proud.  You're a disgusting human being.

t1_dubaqet	0.732200	*	Yeah, so keep Russia happy with oil and stay in power. ISIS came about in the aftermath of toppling Saddam, they wanted to control both Syria and Iraq 
t1_dunoowp	0.401900	*	Oh definitely, everything they put out will have a Russian spin to it. It is called Russia Today.
t1_dv5pr6y	0.624900	*	These three cars you quote are great. But they are still a bit expensive. And some of us are not looking for a sport car to go to work everyday.
t1_dutzu5v	-0.102700	*	The difference here is people have talk touched and seen possessed people and its on film, Bigfoot is a blurry spot in forest pictures.
t1_dv3ix6d	0.624900	*	And then they can tell each other that the_donald is a bastion of free speech, or that other subs are just the same, and know that they're right because *everyone agrees with them.*

t1_duqwm6w	-0.273200	*	The funding will be cut by 2025 according to the new plan. But prior plans saw it end in 2016 and 2020. We will see what happens in the next few years.

t1_dufuz5y	0.502300	*	Yeah but you can recognize a shoddy driver to a certain extent and make space and otherwise be in control of the situation.  These trained professionals started their descent too early.

t1_dv0t9dn	-0.618700	*	Yes, but at a far lower level than in the US. There were only [32 gun homocides](http://fortune.com/2018/02/20/australia-gun-control-success/) in 2013-14.

t1_dv5sh36	-0.153100	*	> huge cash cow for many foreign manufacturers  Actually, its the opposite. Because cars in the US are comparatively cheap and liability risks are very high. 
t1_duuwh5i	0.543900	*	Well, hawaiin is canadian, and perhaps one day if india becomes the dominant super power and begins to ban consumption of cows, don't complain when hamburgers are taken away.

t1_duzysik	0.000000	*	I get his point though. Before long non-white Hispanics will be the majority in the US. I wonder how that will affect US politics.

t1_duu18xy	-0.476700	*	That doesn't even make any sense. Did you mean *ending suffrage* and press the wrong autocomplete instead?

t1_dub842n	-0.680800	*	The fact that you have a military industrial complex in the first place is part of the problem. Why shut down old production lines when you can just sell weapons to the public? 
t1_dv01ijt	-0.510600	*	Welp, calling names is indeed somewhere in between a nickname and an insult, I guess. 
t1_duqbqnq	-0.624900	*	She bailed out wall street CEOs at taxpayer expense, and then did the same for the automotive industry. She's one of the worst crony capitalists that's ever lived.
t1_dux7fvr	0.592700	*	Maybe previously, but every since they introduced the blade UI, I find the UI much nicer than wither google cloud or AWS.

t1_duacxtv	-0.542300	*	There is no argument about the possibility that people can change their minds. Obviously they can. The argument is about OP's assertion that they definitely have.

t1_dusxkxa	0.296000	*	I agree with you, but that's not how the court ruled.  The goal should be to idiot-proof them, so this cannot happen. You do want everyone's intentions to be properly represented on their ballots.

t1_dv4wx3j	-0.077200	*	It's covered in hills. It's pretty bad terrain. The reason it's worked here was because of the model the govt chose, which I believe is quite different from NBN

t1_dv26gxj	-0.746900	*	So? The fact that it was illegal is a huge deal. You could argue anything is foreign interference but it matters whether laws were broken since that suggests a line was crossed.
t1_duf8rgq	0.769000	*	It wasn't long ago that private armies were better funded and  more powerful than national ones.  Don't forget your history.

t1_dujlhvz	-0.458800	*	It's not about one side loosing the election, it's about  a foreign campaign to weaken our elections.  Even if Donald Trump lost the election this would still need to be investigated and solved.

t1_ducu7si	0.399100	*	Oh I know that user very well, he's in every thread defending the ccp in any way he can while his buddies vote manipulate.    Doubt he's an American liberal though, more like a chibese nationalist or

t1_duhy4mz	0.510600	*	Well yeah that's what I'm saying I know how the albedo feedback loop works, people will just misinterpret and think that it's the ice melting that increases the water volume directly.
t1_duqbdtd	-0.251600	*	Election fraud doesnt work quite like that. At any rate, Putin doesnt need election fraud to win at this time.

t1_dujkzla	-0.533400	*	That's not what he said. Just because you don't like a statistic, does not mean it isn't true.
t1_dulujka	-0.822800	*	I have no rebuttal. I'd be suspicious as fuck. More suspicious than, My herpes has scabbed over. It's totally fine, or, Those aren't anal warts.

t1_dv2ej44	-0.738500	*	Obvious and desperate cries of both sides are the same! are desperate and obvious. You may think you're shaping discourse, but no one is buying your bs and you sound rediculous.

t1_duyphj0	0.709600	*	I would imagine that since the WH has declared the president's tweets as official they probably take extra special care with archiving his tweets specifically.
t1_duj468k	0.726900	*	I know there are reasons (though, let's be honest, excuses is more accurate) for it. That doesn't change the fact that Russia's treatment of LGBT persons is barbaric compared to the United States'.

t1_dv0p091	-0.817600	*	No, you got banned for being a dick. There are tons of conservatives in there and in /r/medicine 
t1_dulqzta	0.457600	*	That is a really interesting read. You have earned one delta: 
t1_dut073p	-0.401900	*	Which is why you say fuck the stormcloaks. A United empire is the only hope against the thalmor. What could a war ravaged Skyrim do against the high elves?
t1_duzf15z	0.077200	*	If the demands are lower than why does Canada build more of it?  Cities like Vancouver or Calgary or Montreal demolish similarly sized American cities for rapid transit.

t1_dur3pi1	-0.250000	*	Imo, media has shown code was broken. I heard police took a code, that cop in flordia took a pension while kids took bullets. {Money well spent}
t1_dutn31o	0.670500	*	But thats not influenced from an outside force. That to Eugenics is like two dogs doing it because one can run faster vs us chosing to inseminate a dog because smushed faces are cute.
t1_durtiuv	0.401900	*	Do you support the well-known saying: Might makes right.?
t1_dujkhm2	0.831600	*	Thanks for the reply, you make some good points.  The idea that norms and rules are being put aside and ignored under the cover of populist rhetoric is certainly a good modern parallel.

t1_duk7f2s	-0.318200	*	That'd make sense if I was trying to convince you, but if evidence means nothing to you, then all that's left is to make clear my contempt for you. Carry on
t1_duomq8w	-0.542300	*	But they are there and worth killing over to the dealers who run those neighborhoods.

t1_duo1br7	0.481300	*	Yea I definitely agree that parents should keep their firearms locked up or on their person at all times. I'm just not so sure that you can legally require people to get them
t1_durj2s9	0.000000	*	Put a some corn on your windowsill and catch pigeons.
t1_duoqb2c	0.000000	*	That's because he gaslights his audience

t1_dusi8m3	-0.883400	*	One can hope.  Otherwise we'll have an imperial fuck ton of debt to pay pff for some dumb ass project. 
t1_dua52dn	0.591100	*	Australian here. It's easier for us than the U.S to implement our laws. We don't have any land borders and we have a tiny population. I honestly do not know a solution that would work for America.
t1_duwqbq8	0.709600	*	And you should give the same reply if they say it is 'not christianity' while doing something that is clearly inspired by christianity.

t1_duljce0	-0.431000	*	Because SA has been funding terrorist cells for *years*, and we've known about it, but oil, so.
t1_duumisj	0.542300	*	Having two major parties is fine. It's difference between letting the electorate pick the governing coalition at election time vs post-election negotiating (see, e.g., Germany).  
t1_duprali	-0.401900	*	So, how many real fights have you been in?
t1_duqb9ui	0.967400	*	Annoying yes, but not useless. Dissatisfaction is not fun, but I feel it is a driver for success, particularly if it is paired with a strong desire to improve upon things.

t1_dv17ru6	0.718400	*	Lol. That was going to be the other thing I said. A 20th century history book is already a pretty thorough refutation of Marxism in practice.
t1_duypmnv	-0.414900	*	Is there proof of that? And if there is, is there proof that it isn't the supporters themselves using bots?

t1_dupq9bh	0.492600	*	Ah, thanks for the clarification!
t1_dufad5p	0.401900	*	If you treat everything that is 'wrong' the same, you end up making absurd decisions.
t1_dv2o3ny	-0.318200	*	The markets are constantly being moved by news, the drop in the equity markets was linked to protectionism which is bad for free markets
t1_dud5gcy	-0.250000	*	I hate it when stuff is closed off to Canadians. Like I would gladly buy YouTube Red. But Google actively refuses my money. So instead I use Adblock on YouTube, because fuck ads.

t1_dudwz3k	0.358600	*	> I won't stop buying coffees though  I thought the same thing until caffeine addiction started fucking up my heart rate and blood pressure... Be careful about your dosage.

t1_dua8cvp	0.000000	*	Have you tried turning it off and on again?
t1_dui8jlr	0.340000	*	Perhaps I was thinking of social security, which does have a cap.
t1_duqbtmj	0.361200	*	The use of internment camps like that in colonization was used first by the British, the Italians were just copying them.  How does that make this unique to Fascism.

t1_dv1uh73	0.476700	*	My brain combined your comment and your username and now next time someone flies off the handle I want to ask them:  Do you need a nice cup of tea and an orgasm?
t1_dua7gid	0.475300	*	Ooh, that'll be nice!
t1_dulioy2	0.153100	*	I feel like we'll solve a lot of the world's problems if we got rid of fucking guns. How about that?
t1_duotass	0.080600	*	Doesn't matter.  As the dominate group gets marginalized fringe groups gain power.  Now do they seize power by force or by elections no idea but I expect mass expulsions to hit sometime in the future.

t1_dv268f3	-0.924600	*	The dead kid mentioned earlier was in no way, shape or form visibly mutilated or tortured.   You're thinking of the pictures of the prisoners executed by ISIS which were indeed very graphic.
t1_duqz8wo	-0.510600	*	Looks like the ghost tore out his intestines then strangled him with them.
t1_dv0r3ul	0.273200	*	GMOs are largely made to have increased resistance to pesticides so more can be sprayed on them, pesticide use is as high as ever with GMO crops

t1_dua5sty	0.318200	*	We have incredibly stringent requirements to get one though. A huge amount of paperwork, mental health background checks, and a professional of some sort to sign it to vouch for your character.

t1_dug845x	0.000000	*	I don't think they get the standard payouts that athletes get when they get medals if they aren't competing for the flag. Believe Russia pays out around $60k for a gold.
t1_duykq62	-0.766000	*	Jesus what a fucking retarded sentence. You're absolutely correct, it's just that combination of words makes me want to fuck my own eye sockets.
t1_dur9sor	0.571900	*	Yeah.  Stalins SU, sans natural resources or fertile land. 
t1_dv1jicz	-0.273200	*	To be fair that had nothing to do with being a criminal. Anyone could have received that for talking to the judge that way.
t1_dv05dvv	0.000000	*	What about Mr Robots tyrell wellick
t1_dv528t3	-0.364800	*	Well that is the difference isn't it. Trump is just doing it for who the fucks know why but EU is playing it out smart so Trump loses the most out of the fight. 
t1_duqvlhs	-0.051600	*	Right and wrong have nothing to do with politics. The people should demand justice all the time.

t1_dusoxo9	0.670500	*	Why would you care if a consenting adult has sex with another consenting adult. Are you suggesting having sex with coworkers in any way affects your ability to do your job?
t1_dunxyw8	0.177900	*	Well, when you consider *all* religious holy books are complete works of fiction, it's hard *not* to misinterpret these writings. 
t1_dv0p2zb	0.000000	*	Because America has a unique culture that allowed that to happen, historically that's not what happens in most places in the world.  But multi-culturalism is changing that, fast.

t1_dv2h9fw	0.273200	*	Thats what Im thinking as well. Ive been slowly pulling out of the market for a couple of months now.
t1_duxu0et	0.273200	*	Well you can believe it litteraly as long as you also take into account the context.
t1_dud9hdb	0.000000	*	Congress passed sanctions is glossing over the fact that they were passed nearly unanimously in both houses. Also means it had a veto proof majority. 
t1_durfy8e	-0.884700	*	Yep, but they totally didn't want people owning the weapons of war. /s
t1_dudhxap	0.790600	*	Second to the favorite redditor. I actively seek out poppinKREAMs posts to help me understand going ons with the Trump administration.

t1_dv2pr11	0.250000	*	Look up the economic principle of Comparative Advantage
t1_dut8cms	0.743000	*	Oh, ok. So between the current Mongolia border and the ancient great wall of China is inner Mongolia?
t1_dud3hb5	-0.743000	*	My worry is more that they're not looking into it very deeply right now for fear of getting their head cut off. Could just be a leak free ship with that regards though. 
t1_duskfy7	0.000000	*	Reddit is full of them...
t1_durl0tw	0.820100	*	Not to detract from other countries but I singled out Germany because the original post was about Germany. Yes, the UK and thereabouts will probably suffer greatest from a declining gulf stream.

t1_dusww99	0.000000	*	Xi Jinping is not really considered much of a technocrat. His predecessor was. 
t1_duphh5b	-0.372000	*	Yeah, because they are Religious people don't like them, therefore it's not Religion at fault, it's human cruelty.

t1_dv1tt1c	0.476700	*	That's what people don't get. Other countries only say that they want to be 100% nice. Nobody lays on a fucking sword irl. 
t1_duvj0wr	0.855500	*	The best time to plant a tree is 20 years ago.  The second best time is today.

t1_dujj66g	0.000000	*	Is that you George Costanza? 
t1_dusmz2g	0.770300	*	True. Still, that suggests any vote-rigging ability is limited enough to justify more conspicuous active measures like the propaganda campaign we've been seeing.  
t1_duac8oi	-0.401900	*	> we'd lose a lot of legitimacy  We could just spend some military power to shore that up
t1_dufj6ax	-0.296000	*	No, I dont have sociopathic tendencies, do you ? 
t1_duxta2r	0.000000	*	What? Women not being allowed to wear pants was precisely because we wanted to control them. Same as them not being allowed to exercise or use the post office. It was always about control.

t1_duiqmpr	-0.108200	*	I believe in non interventionism. Since Truman wanted to assist South Korea he should have committed to it, anything less is a waste of time.
t1_dv7h1j6	0.757900	*	As a Russian who has been complimented on her English proficiency - that is useful to know.   Also, something that has been pointed out for me - overuse of passive voice.

t1_dujy7tn	0.000000	*	They are, but they're becoming unreasonably expensive for Bitcoin. Monero has the same mechanism as a tumbler natively in its transaction tech.
t1_dv4huvm	0.678900	*	True. But we don't like *or* hate them. Compared to each other, the US seems to have a much more emotional and less rational relationship.

t1_duw9bkp	-0.403700	*	Its definitely relevant but policy changes are nice too but shits corrupt and its not that easy. Which is exactly why individuals taking action is what we need until then. Vote with your wallet 
t1_dum8ajn	-0.624000	*	Yes it is.  In case you were unaware, reddit has a shit-ton of bots sowing discord.  Thinking this is limited to FB and Twitter is extremely naive.

t1_dux0el9	0.000000	*	Not really. This is a Eurasian speciality. Look at Russia, the Stans, than compare to Baltics, Poland etc. Different world, different mindset.

t1_dugph0u	0.585900	*	That's like saying his original comment that Israel is a soveign state. is implying that the article said the opposite.
t1_durmxh9	-0.827100	*	I never said it was right or wrong. But either way by definition it is terrorism. You added a connotation to the word

t1_dudomut	0.190100	*	I agree but just pointing out there can be gray area here
t1_dv2kig6	-0.172000	*	Trump is so much worse than W on every front other than not starting a dumb war... yet.
t1_dv4n67z	0.273200	*	Even if his lawyer had 3mil, then Trump would owe HIM money.    And moving that kind of money in a hurry unnoticed is hard. He kept it in his business/building. Just like all the Trumps and Kushner.
t1_duuywmo	-0.288700	*	Due process is such a slippery slope. Without it someone always pays for the crime. Whether or not they were guilty is irrelevant.

t1_duq9gig	-0.250000	*	Its called skepticism 
t1_duymld6	0.847200	*	To be fair, that's not 100% the Russians. They wouldn't have had this success if the Republicans hadn't spent the last few decades prepping their base for something like this.

t1_duk6bzy	0.526700	*	Fair point well made.

t1_dv2c4wd	-0.757900	*	Dont worry I left the U.K. so I dont have to vote in a constituency where my vote didnt count.  Hold on I can still vote.  Ah shit, international disenfranchisement it is.

t1_dun0beq	0.000000	*	This does nothing though.   Just formulate your own ideas and opinions for a change, and research source material, it normally takes all of ten seconds.
t1_dv2kgcb	0.667500	*	Maybe we'd be more willing to believe that he wasn't a Russian stooge if he didn't suck Putins cock at every opportunity and refuse to enact sanctions that were almost universally supported. 
t1_dui8ubs	0.736900	*	Queue the Clinton Foundation. Charities are tax shelters and aside from the Childrens Hospital, most are shit. I will always donate to the childrens hospital. Great charity.
t1_due8dk4	-0.599400	*	And where does it say anywhere about reducing over regulation.   The people who're still salty about brexit are the denses mother fuckers online.

t1_dugyt7i	-0.296000	*	Lol whatever you say, I'm not trying to argue...merely point out how dumb you come across.  I never tried to make a point.  Seriously, learn 10 year old grammar if you wish to make arguments online.  
t1_duxjcr6	-0.893000	*	Im sorry youre so angry over stuff that you really shouldnt be angry about. Peoples religion is their business. And youre just a bully as far as I can tell.
t1_dv0pwpt	0.789000	*	Well I'm not arguing, the US government apparently spent more time fabricating evidence than trying to retrieve it. More effective. 
t1_durtf6y	0.401900	*	It's a political ad. Coming for you means they're voting the other party out of office. Don't be melodramatic.
t1_dv3vhny	-0.025800	*	And therefore God Emporer wont even blockade them if it leads to ww3. The US has bluffed China before, and Mao called the US out on it. And no A-bombs were dropped at all

t1_duaau50	0.723600	*	I get the feeling a lot more people would've voted if Clinton wasn't given a 99% chance to win. They won't let the idiots of America speak for them again and elect someone like him.

t1_dv14yaa	-0.649700	*	Its French law. You cannot share terroristic actions willy nilly. It makes far more sense to ban or censor voilent actions than sexual content, which is what we do in the US.

t1_duaqkng	-0.292400	*	Seems to me that more people voted against Trump than for Hillary. She didn't enthuse the demographics she should have.
t1_dunsjm5	0.585900	*	And data shows that that's typically who wins elections. Funding is what matters.
t1_duryv2w	-0.381800	*	That's a muddled exaggeration peddled by advocacy groups like violence policy center. Look at [CNN's](http://money.cnn.com/news/cnnmoney-investigates/nra-funding-donors/index.html) summary.

t1_duma61e	-0.296000	*	Your continued characterization of it as mutilation is misguided and invalidates the rest of your statement. Aside form which, you make no sense.
t1_dunzg2p	-0.718400	*	No, being fully automatic is exactly what makes it an assault rifle. Otherwise it is just a rifle. So what you're really suggesting is banning rifles.

t1_duhwqsv	0.128000	*	Not quite.  They got done for favouring their browser by preinstalling it.  Not straight up refusing to let you install other browsers.

t1_duh4xbx	-0.807400	*	If Trump was playing a battle of wits mirror, he would have a 400 card deck, thinking there's no way he can lose the impending battle of wits...
t1_dv2fwk2	-0.102700	*	I personally find it hard to believe that trump even knows what due process means.

t1_dutgrcl	0.192600	*	It's unreasonable to hold your citizens to a higher standard than foreign aliens ? Are you kidding me ?
t1_dv0trha	0.804700	*	That's very reasonable, but these people want to make a point about how the EU is stiffling their freedom and also probably something about Islam.
t1_duxpuyg	0.325200	*	*You* people. I would never tell you lies.
t1_dudgu9u	-0.679400	*	They really did not care whether they helped Trump or not. Putin does not like Hillary Clinton and made it a mission to squash her!!

t1_duia05u	0.623400	*	I would say more in the 40k-80k range, once you hit 90-100k you're pretty much upper middle class, and even with a family of 4 or 5, you aren't worried about bills unless you live an exorbant life.
t1_dubt6sy	-0.510600	*	This is the weakest troll attempt I've seen.
t1_dui8c9s	0.844200	*	Good job conserving your energy. Smart play. Most of that stuff will be irrelevant anyway the next time the tax code is amended.

t1_dujzlen	0.421500	*	Well I guess Craig and Zwaan both worked at the same firm a few years after Craig resigned. Interesting.
t1_duxsnve	0.580100	*	The guy I initially replied to made it about American progressives.   I agree that women in Iran should not be forced to wear something they don't want to wear.

t1_duib8sa	0.700300	*	Yup. A family in this range is too rich for any help or subsidies but not making enough to do well on their own. Its a donut hole in our policies.

t1_durj9kc	-0.381800	*	I agree. Our power grid can and should be sorted. But as a society we need to reduce our obsession with meat every meal. Cows are one of the biggest problems due to how many we produce.
t1_duziqut	-0.718400	*	We dont have to go back to Kennedy. Clinton was a married man who constantly slept around and has been accused of sexual assault by multiple women.
t1_dui0dmx	0.524500	*	My obvious point is that no media can be fully trusted on their own, and no media, regardless of who they are, can be fully trusted.

t1_dut6io4	-0.226300	*	Which is how a union works and is a good check on power blocks. My point was that the U.S. is a big block and has some influence. That 22 percent of the budget is one of the big reasons for that.

t1_dui9uqr	-0.102700	*	Yes, life gives people advantages they didn't earn. So... what the hell is your point, exactly?
t1_dv50qzg	0.746300	*	I mean they are essentially just toys for the rich so it's not that surprising, but I'm surprised he hasn't bought a Rimac instead given that he certainly has the money to buy one.

t1_dv1yfr9	0.624900	*	Oh, yeah I guess I can see that. I mostly post in r/politics, where headlines cannot be revised or edited in any way, so it never occurred to me to change it. Thanks for the feedback.
t1_dug01w1	0.822500	*	First that article is trash. They use a redditor as a source. Second, do you honestly believe that r/politics doesn't have it's own fair share of Russian bots? That's pretty naive.
t1_dujkf4v	0.000000	*	In fact, it was satire, so it was really supposed to be more of a how-and-why-NOT-to guide. 
t1_dv90enj	0.670500	*	yeah we should, like forces the release of the tax returns, forcing the selling off of your business empire to prevent conflict of interest, both are fairly simple things that should be bipartisan.

t1_dudse6u	0.190100	*	I agree but if we just removed their copyright or whatever why would they do the R and D in the first place? 
t1_duw5gle	-0.458800	*	A left wing drug dealer is par for the course. A right wing drug dealer is a huge shame and should be helped out of it and no mention should be made of it thereafter.

t1_dv3ohck	-0.275500	*	Exactly. It's not like reddit uses Captcha for individual comments.
t1_dupibun	-0.676900	*	Germany? After ww1 they just got huge debt, after two I'm not sure if they did. The attitude was a rebuild one instead of punish.

t1_dv39mw2	0.000000	*	It could be that they wanted to quarantine these people to the sub?  Deleting the main area they congregate would just force them to spread.  I don't know if that's the case, but it's a perspective. 
t1_dull8dl	-0.381800	*	Nah, cus Trump is going to jail. Go back to r/t_d and stop trying to find information that confirms your beliefs. 
t1_dusejwi	0.636900	*	Trump will claim anything regardless of its veracity and then say he is the best. His words are irrelevant to reality.

t1_duxkuqw	-0.458800	*	No. There is no difference. Women don't have a choice either way. You think women that legally work in brothels have a choice?
t1_duskp53	0.000000	*	Should the question be why not tackle the drug issue in US?
t1_duruelu	-0.444500	*	That's kind of my point. Germany is a real place, comic book solutions are a bad idea in real life. Particularly ones like the Punisher.
t1_dul6yv0	0.599400	*	Ah ok, this is the new party line. Gotcha.
t1_due2lpl	-0.318200	*	Probably because the greedy ones wrote the laws.

t1_dulmd6k	-0.848100	*	If it comes to needing to shoot a cop then the situation has well passed reason.   Use it to defend yourself from people who would try to steal from you or kill you.

t1_duj4ypg	-0.102700	*	No one was implying any of that?  Likewise, getting defensive for no reason doesnt make anyone a better person either.
t1_duel3xx	-0.726900	*	This is literally referencing things that have happened, *with* solid evidence. Nothing here is a conspiracy. You're just an idiot. 
t1_dura051	0.250000	*	Yes, because we have to have a fine understanding of the capacity to which we can murder people before we decided if thats an ability worth preserving

t1_duv34sc	0.296000	*	And now the French are helping us with the nuclear tech part of a nuclear submarine. So i guess they dont intend to repeat that in the near future.

t1_dupk56q	-0.542300	*	true, i was being hyperbolic.   i know it pisses americans off, but military spending is simply a waste of money for half the european countries. which is why many will never meet the nato goal.

t1_dv00w60	0.153100	*	>If the EFF were actually in charge, i imagine it'd be a bigger deal globally.  This already happened in Zimbabwe/Rhodesia.  No one in the media cared then either.
t1_dup7jtu	0.154800	*	I mean, when talking about the role of women in Islam, handshaking is kind of low down in grand scheme of things.

t1_duq3tg0	0.208100	*	Yeah, way to parrot a stat and completely ignore all the negative externalities if alcohol vs tobacco.  You can enjoy throwing it in a pan as you are so fond of, but it is a scourge on society.
t1_dupqv9c	-0.493900	*	Even worse is that the press covers that instead of people who actually know what they're doing. The media on both sides is definitely guilty of this. 
t1_dv0osgh	0.000000	*	What you're suggesting is what the US does, and it hasn't worked at all. See also: dicamba drift. 
t1_dua9xzh	0.585900	*	Having been on both sides of this issue in my life, you've nailed it. It takes a ton of time and energy upfront to live a healthy life. There's also a really big psychological factor to it. 
t1_dv58jho	0.493900	*	The United States is the breadbasket of North America.  Now, talk to be about people rioting about low Iphone supplies and I'll agree with you.

t1_duo0wvb	0.000000	*	The issue is that rubbish such as straws, fast food containers etc often don't even make it to a bin never mind a landfill.  Why have trash at all if you can have re-usable products?

t1_dud3q2h	0.102700	*	Funny thing is there are no bigger fools than the Hillary supporters.
t1_duzwkbw	-0.296000	*	Still can't drink, and there's no class for people who turn 21 for it either.

t1_dunslwq	0.810000	*	excellent, that'll help in states that haven't legislated it yet. but the major reforms we need *do* need congressional approval, has Congress upped the ATFs budget recently btw

t1_duykew5	-0.768400	*	Me either but Trump is a pompous asshole that constantly belittles people, makes wild accusations, and denies this stuff.  Was he married at the time? 
t1_ducvx26	0.541100	*	Then I might've been misinformed, weren't people banging on the car? Or better yet, I'll just watch the videos later myself, haven't really looked since the day it took place. Thanks!

t1_dv3cprt	0.493900	*	Well, from my understanding you generally aren't allowed to prove if you are the subject of/participating in a federal investigation. I'm fairly certain people have gone to jail for that in the past.
t1_dueiv1v	0.202300	*	You're completely delusional if you think regulating pharmaceutical prices doesn't work, since every single developed nation that isn't the USA regulates drug costs, and they're all doing just fine.

t1_duuyrf3	0.000000	*	All I can imagine is a prawn in a short white dress wearing a wig.
t1_duh7an4	0.102700	*	That's making assumptions though. Until a sentencing agreement is released there's no way to know whether he got off lightly or not. Until then it's just projecting.

t1_dv1o3ah	0.635900	*	Yes, maple *flavored* syrup is not maple syrup. I live in the U.S. and specifically buy actual maple syrup, it's so worth it.

t1_dv2shys	0.000000	*	NAFTA is still in effect.

t1_dutdyq9	0.126000	*	Believe me it helps A LOT! If Mexican presidency had no term limit and can be elected behind a closed door, many Mexican people would not only run to the U.S., but also consider Guatemala. 
t1_dujzvbx	0.612400	*	Only idiots think the polls were wrong, it means they don't know how to read them. Or you're like Huffpo or NYT who don't know how to conduct a poll and put the chances to win at 99%

t1_dui0o0x	0.177900	*	You can still have flexibility. If the employer thinks they can justify not forcing the worker to work their minimum hours, but paying them flat, that's on them.

t1_dutro6u	-0.735100	*	I'm a lil high and I don't think I'm reading this right. If WW3 started right now, the president could suspend elections and just remain president until the end of the war?

t1_dugvj8e	0.440400	*	You think that's absurd, just wait for the Donald J Trump presidential library. Just a wall with scrolling tweets projected on it, and 3000 copies of Art of the Deal in the gift shop. 
t1_dudxuar	-0.115400	*	I'll grant that my comment was imprecise, but as strict liability crimes are in the minority, the comment was nonetheless technically correct.

t1_duxiy1i	-0.619100	*	What? That makes this way more stupid then. Why are you asking for a source that you can't even read? We could give you an article about birds and you would think it's whatever we say it is.

t1_dulehxj	-0.529100	*	I would normally agree. But I have a feeling we're hitting new lows. I have no doubt Russian trolls are a major factor in all the things that transpired, but it's not like it's the *only* factor.

t1_dv09g2t	0.381800	*	Your total figure of 10 million people is on the low end of the estimates I've seen. But yeah I agree with everything you said.

t1_dusj8jr	-0.226300	*	Ok but fuck the Empire. Cowards just let surrendered and let those blasted elves move in. This never would've happened under a real emperor like Tiber Septim.
t1_duz8tlw	0.000000	*	We would have to learn to tie our shoes..
t1_dv0cujy	0.000000	*	The Vegas one was unusual.  Unless there is something more than just a death-toll to report, it's omitted from the news bulletin.
t1_duoxozb	0.000000	*	I can't believe someone had the balls to bring a gram of cocaine into that place. BLOWs my mind

t1_dv1ixmz	-0.420100	*	6 years doesn't count dude. Plus you're talking about Italians here. They could barely get the trains to run on time in Rome at that time. I highly doubt they stripped Ethiopia's resources in 6 years.
t1_dv1w5hv	-0.318200	*	Subsidies sound bad. Tariffs can be made to pretend they protect American jobs.  Anyone who took ECON 101 will tell you tariffs are pure BS.

t1_durokc1	0.000000	*	Maybe we could build an extra large keystone pipe.
t1_duqpgn2	-0.051600	*	The wild card here is the Russians. They cant be easily prosecuted and if their goal is just to destabilize the US they can keep this up and then just throw Trump under the bus when they tire of him. 
t1_dv2jfk8	0.742500	*	How is this not interfering in US politics? Surely this is more effective than a bunch of russian trolls.

t1_duli2tc	0.000000	*	And at secondary level, it's literally called Philosophy and Ethics because only half the course is about religion
t1_duvdr1b	-0.296000	*	No one said that. 
t1_duzxqz4	-0.718400	*	I never said this at all.  My only point was that the people who make these terrible decisions aren't the only ones who have to live with them. So saying, let them starve isn't that simple. 
t1_dupkk5w	0.296000	*	Yeah, the golfers don't.
t1_duqutlm	-0.318200	*	Except there is a historic number of house GOP retiring and that will be enough to bring significant investigations against our criminal president.
t1_dui158u	0.642800	*	I've heard that as well but flexible work exists without zero hour contracts. The key issue is that they are not flexible for the employee.
t1_duayip3	0.877700	*	I couldn't agree with you more, but it would take something incredible for Putin to let there be fair elections.   I hope Russia can figure it out.  Thanks for the response.
t1_dujny0c	0.762600	*	Yeah well so do all the others youve denigrated. And that last part would be a pretty thorough waste of your time, so, ok.
t1_duv36f5	0.000000	*	Maybe look up what a pharmacist actually does instead of assuming they just throw pills into containers. 
t1_dupkevi	-0.421500	*	Nuclear fanboys have zero idea how to handle the waste. 
t1_dua8pz5	-0.791300	*	That is just an immature opinion.  FDR put fucking citizens in concentration camps so don't give me no bullshit about being the worst.

t1_dv0re9u	-0.381800	*	Well in fairness we were attacked which is why we got into the war.  We didnt do it to save the French.

t1_dubzoyl	0.000000	*	I'm gonna go ahead an say you don't know anything about film styles or marketing. Also the way you try to be condescending makes you come off as an edgy 14 year old.
t1_duk51r3	0.000000	*	That's the plot of an episode of Futurama, but, instead of bacterium, they are just pine trees, a lot of them.
t1_dutn2xj	0.128000	*	When there is no nuance to a comparison, it is functionally equating two things. I wish more people understood that.
t1_dupz09r	0.831300	*	Well maybe he can try his hand at one of the other countless religions. Some are stricter and some are more relaxed. 
t1_dumoycs	0.557400	*	My reasoning is that rich people (rich in a general sense, not one percenter rich) don't need to take bribes because their material needs and well-being are already guaranteed.
t1_due6v6d	0.000000	*	Only muricans
t1_duhn14t	0.000000	*	Compare the skylines

t1_due0qy0	0.718400	*	Yeah, well I support gutting and closing said programs as is happening now.   Nothing is owed to anyone.
t1_dv35fqz	0.000000	*	Go back to Moscow. 
t1_dup3046	-0.526700	*	*.. they said, on an anonymous forum.*  There's no way that can hold up in any reasonable court. There's no ID-checking on any of the social media platforms you're using.
t1_dupozyb	-0.273200	*	Still German bonds had negative interest last year or two years ago. You literally had to pay them to lend them money. 
t1_dupfmxf	-0.476700	*	How is that fair? If people want to kill themselves, they should be able to..
t1_duu9efi	-0.452200	*	Even with conventional warfare, unless we had a *very* legitimate reason to do so, the public outcry from every other nation on planet Earth would be astounding. 
t1_duwb1js	0.361200	*	Kalinigrad. Altho it is at the mercy of Denmark and therefore NATO to get to the north sea and atlantic.
t1_dv005xi	0.000000	*	Exactly.
t1_dv2yafx	-0.128000	*	I know, just agreeing with the guy who said that a nomination is basically worthless. 
t1_dv41jsw	-0.296000	*	The averge of two tusks and no tusks is one horn.  The math works out for the trunk and snout, too.  Rhinos will forever be pigephants in my head, now.
t1_dux0fnj	-0.128000	*	Tough on **non-white crime**   FTFY.
t1_dupu2af	-0.128000	*	Ironic considering they're doing trials and tests to consider using psilocybin as a medicine.

t1_dud1w8m	0.000000	*	People quoting him and him posting it are 2 different things.  You realize this right?
t1_duqg93d	0.440400	*	Sounds better than the bachelor
t1_dugcfoi	0.612400	*	Probably a good idea not to give it to 6 year old Alfie. There are other side effects associated with it. He was doing well on the cannabis oil.
t1_duwo09m	0.853600	*	My german autocorrect just does not stop capitalizing shit XD 
t1_dukcw7w	0.318200	*	Spicer's still working within the administration.  He just tweeted an attaboy to DT.  Not sure how he has the moral high ground?

t1_dv0drgz	0.000000	*	Julius Malema isn't the leader of South Africa
t1_ducun95	0.887300	*	I didn't call you stupid. However, if you aren't stupid, you are actively trying to hurt American interests by virtue of your defense of and support for Donald Trump's presidency.

t1_due0o38	0.000000	*	Imgur is a news source in the same way Facebook and Twitter is.
t1_duhmcfe	0.440400	*	Yes, agreed.   But we must be careful not to draw false equivalencies here: not all ideologies are equally capable of producing and justifying violence. 
t1_ducapzh	0.318200	*	Fair. 
t1_duwgzkw	0.000000	*	I dont think you understand what sources are. 
t1_duba852	0.401900	*	yes, you are correct.
t1_duanmdd	0.318200	*	Exactly. You can't expect anything with such a huge consequence. 
t1_dv2optx	0.000000	*	I don't think you even know the meaning of the word corrupt. It's pure hyperbole to call Clinton corrupt.
t1_dui32z9	0.049000	*	You're right. It's not like we had the global financial center in our domain or the ability to regulate the world's banks.  Hey, wait a minute...
t1_dutmilr	-0.790600	*	I'm not defending it? The person wasn't saying islam was bad, he was saying muslims are bad. If you have an issue with the religion, target the religion.
t1_dv48bcy	0.000000	*	Though, Melania will still be First Lady when Barron gets elected, so there won't be too much change for us to deal with
t1_dujtfsv	-0.802800	*	Dont move the goalposts here - the topic itt is if Trump denied that Russians meddled - not that Trump committed a crime - and Obama is as relevant to this conversation as David Letterman is. 
t1_dv0qs0j	-0.401900	*	So your previous comment was nonsense. You seem to have a firm grasp on the situation rather than it being unthinkable.
t1_duq266p	0.000000	*	And you live somewhere with less traffic...
t1_dv3jb31	0.440400	*	Maybe it was Hope job. Maybe she talked about it in her diary. 
t1_duzbm9y	0.241100	*	It's not lack of education, they just choose to believe in fairy tales instead of facts.
t1_dud22a7	-0.226300	*	They were going to have Flynn sign a deal then all of a sudden they stopped it. Flynn has not signed a deal yet. 
t1_dv0d3xp	0.361200	*	Like anytime governments have forcefully removed skilled people from their lands.
t1_duqi71f	0.000000	*	oh boy oh boy oh boy
t1_duodibd	0.177900	*	You do realize the irony here, right? The subject was propaganda in Russia; now all the sudden we're talking about a U.S. policy that has kept Americans safe.
t1_dubz6rg	0.875000	*	> At least it is a better culture, especially if you are trying to raise a kid.  You need to expand on that, because it's pretty bold statement

t1_duvhvh0	0.153100	*	what happens when a military is no longer controlled via orders but rather a flip of a switch, which is directly situated on top of the leader's desk?
t1_dv0304r	0.318200	*	Apartheid was a huge deal though, not just a small part of history. If you learned about British history, you should have learned about Africa being colonized and about Apartheid, also. 
t1_ducgv32	0.000000	*	Oh look, a pig from the Donald.
t1_dv2r939	-0.636900	*	The saddest thing is that probably any other Democratic candidate could have won in a landslide. The GOP had been waging a war against Clinton since the 90s, too much baggage.
t1_dur9nm1	0.492600	*	Thanks!
t1_duazkf0	-0.207500	*	Soooo... you'd be one of those people making Amazon da evil capitalist behemoth it is. K. Just so we're clear.
t1_dusy87a	0.475400	*	Those are books titles, books were stacks of paper with words printed on them and glued together.  They were very popular in pre-internet years.
t1_dulp0cy	0.000000	*	Nonono, it's because reddit **loves** Kim Jong Un, don't you see?
t1_dulnevr	-0.051600	*	I'd love to, but where would you deport them *to*?  The whole colonies thing no longer works.
t1_duprssi	0.000000	*	Back in the 70s and 80s? Try present day US.
t1_dueaxyu	-0.248400	*	True. We've seen a glimpse of it by how Bush has given the U.S. a really bad name internationally... Making people associate Dubya with everything else American.
t1_duia3r8	-0.421500	*	Sure, baby rapist. Go be like Muhammad and permanently damage an 8 year old girl's internal organs with your penis, make her hair fall out like he did.

t1_duf5ncd	0.000000	*	You know people can go places without immigrating right
t1_dusyk33	0.670500	*	I'm sure you can dig around on the internet for oil reserve estimates but the [Olduvai Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olduvai_theory) might be a good place to start.
t1_dv0qk9v	0.000000	*	That was the point, Im guessing
t1_dust3dm	0.571900	*	A bunch of us should move to the states where he won the electoral vote just so that he doesn't 
t1_dukd7ud	0.000000	*	... Tree Trump 
t1_duhoh0l	0.421500	*	Im already looking into a nice piece of desert right on the coast of Arizona Bay.

t1_duactg5	0.000000	*	They had functioning backup generators further up the hill. But their switchboards were flooded so they had nothing to connect those diesels to in units 1-4.
t1_duugbvw	0.000000	*	Also: bigger houses are harder to heat and maintain. Another reason why European houses stay up much longer than US ones.
t1_duiaz19	-0.476700	*	So the system is broken?
t1_duhx5vb	0.000000	*	Im a /r/superbeagle man myself.

t1_duti52z	0.804900	*	lol, funny then how Ireland continued exporting food despite suffering a famine.
t1_duzgo4g	0.202300	*	Pretty much everything that article accuses him of, the Clintons or DNC did themselves.
t1_duthuk0	0.003700	*	No, it isn't. WTF are you talking about. I'd say denying vaccines to immigrants would be the inhumane action.
t1_duux246	0.750600	*	It would allow addicts a safer way to purchase drugs that they know aren't laced, and would remove the stigma of drug use allowing addicts to get the help they need.
t1_duj50dc	0.809600	*	I love how people think their view is so perfect, that the only way someone could possibly disagree were if they're a shill.
t1_dun8ak7	0.000000	*	Are you really trying to say your amount of mass shootings are comparable to ours? Because its not. 
t1_dv5965u	-0.510600	*	See, using power for your own ends goes both ways. Trump's not the only one with a dick to swing.

t1_dueg13t	-0.340000	*	I'd argue he has a lot of leverage. But who knows the real power balance.
t1_duqzza2	0.000000	*	PLOT TWIST
t1_dv228fq	0.126000	*	So you're defending it? Liberals are in such a weird place ideologically right now...  God capitalism sucks.. but Trump is taking anti-free trade stances so bring on that exploitation!
t1_dupc1gq	0.401900	*	I like that you down voted me instead of using evidence to support you argument
t1_duymuzh	-0.316400	*	Oh interesting, I had no idea that was part of it. How ridiculous! 
t1_dufahb8	0.585900	*	Nah, Im okay, go have fun at the klan rally.  Maybe some girls will come

t1_dv2zl4z	0.636900	*	Safe to assume most alum./steel products are produced with imported raw material. As such, we can expect a price increase in soft drinks and beer cans.
t1_dux03kf	-0.737400	*	It will also make it so that short of recreational use, it won't be useful for anyone that doesn't want to be high. Since ointments, edibles etc, will still be illegal.   
t1_dui97ig	-0.726900	*	Yep, I make 50k exactly. No wiggle room. If I get sick one extra time next year I go broke.

t1_dujzw4c	-0.722500	*	This is not what he has done. The fucking moron can't/won't read the intelligence reports. 
t1_dum8bvh	-0.599400	*	Because, it is not up to him. it takes a majority in the Knesset (parliament) of Israel to declare war.

t1_duayeeq	0.296000	*	Honest question, do you think Japans record low crime rate would remain so if they took in their fair share of refugees?
t1_dv365m2	0.025800	*	Eh, at this point they are there own little bubble filled with bots. I'd wager most people on reddit what that sub is and what they stand for. Their out reach would rarely go past reddit.

t1_duokc7v	-0.477900	*	Less savages

t1_dus46gq	-0.761500	*	No it is not the root of the evil. The root of the evil is a pervasive gun culture in the United States. The NRA is supporting this narrative, so it is evil, but it's not the root.
t1_dugceqf	-0.202300	*	That's true. But its implied in migrant - that's European-talk for economic migrant who isn't a refugee. Its what Americans call an illegal alien.

t1_dulsnyt	0.361200	*	No, all religion in its most basic form assumes and enforces state ideals. State-sponsored mindfulness would be much better, less insidious, and more transparent.
t1_duhsr2c	-0.735100	*	Because he was the only one saying the bad things were the colored peoples fault.  That message resonated with a lot more people than most of us would have thought.

t1_dv4ae3o	-0.177900	*	Yep... Uploading backup to crashplan sure beaks 2tb data for me anyways. I have no idea why they have data cap as CVC and networking cost are usually charged by bandwidth. 
t1_dudvc3b	-0.128000	*	Why? People pay tax, and they benefit from what the tax pays for. Nothing wrong with that
t1_duj5v19	-0.525600	*	As an incredibly broke student I have to disagree with your assessment that my world is fair enough 
t1_dv1ov77	0.440400	*	Thanks for the info. Can't wait for the primary

t1_duq781b	0.250000	*	You're throwing around Hillary-should-be-in-jail-bullshit in a thread that has *nothing* to do with Hillary, and accuse people of goading, lol.
t1_dut0p6a	0.440400	*	I have no interest this argument. I corrected my original post.  Still, I'm curious as to why is this policy coming right now and not in say 4 years.

t1_dv2ith7	-0.241100	*	Hmmm not sure tbh

t1_duqocfe	-0.728700	*	Conspiracy against the US is probably a way less common crime than possession so those private prisons have to get their money somehow. When weed and drugs are legal, something else will come along 
t1_dv4z6n1	-0.735100	*	exactly, arrests require charges. Indefinite detentions have no accountability. 
t1_duyythk	-0.612400	*	We need to describe a new mental disease. Trumpism? I dunno. the word salad wreaks of filth and shit. Hard to hear.
t1_ducbbya	0.000000	*	Military isnt just guns and butter.

t1_dujmozo	0.051600	*	Listen to the Slow Burn podcast by slate covering watergate. That basically was how it was back then. Nixon had 25% approval after bloody Saturday..
t1_dv0v4cf	-0.126000	*	Oh shit I'm sorry. I didn't know I personally ruined unwritten history of the Lenape. I'm so sorry. You should call the Un and warn them that I ruined the history of an entire tribe.

t1_duzew3q	-0.715900	*	That's... a really weak argument.  They're the pro-republican arm of the media and they don't even claim otherwise.

t1_durxnhw	-0.341200	*	There are billions of people who go their whole life without resorting to violence. The problem is convincing the bad people to stop. Which will never happen.

t1_dum6ukn	0.647900	*	I'm not worried. I think I can live for at least two weeks on the squirrels from my back yard. I haven't tried it, but I imagine squirrel with raman noodles is good eatin'. 
t1_dujdrt6	-0.428400	*	You apparently dont know the meaning of homophobia.  Supporting traditional marriage doesnt mean that you hate gays, unless you believe that people are monsters for not agreeing with you.

t1_dv11zd2	0.510600	*	Heroes.
t1_dv3u2m6	0.554200	*	I don't think the dead have any legal rights. You could probably put him in a carnival and have people pay to see him.  Which kinda makes me want to see this movie.

t1_dui7ulo	-0.153100	*	Thats cute you think people voluntarily choose to participate in an economy.  We choose to participate in the economy just as much as we choose to eat food and shit it out.
