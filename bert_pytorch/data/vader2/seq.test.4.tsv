t1_dv0v43i	0.670500	*	Well, probably yes. This is primarily a trade issue, as always.  (I'm not saying it *should be* a trade issue but it certainly is. If Bayer, Monsanto, DuPont and so on were all EU corporations...)

t1_dupo8tp	0.706300	*	> A number of people grab recycling bottles from rubbish bins to make a few coins and so on.  That's true in every country everywhere... except in the US you only get like 2 cents a can/bottle.

t1_duyvwtn	-0.318200	*	None of the indictments have anything to do with Russia.  When you have to lie to make your point across you've already lost.  Womp womp.

t1_dugc3yn	-0.716500	*	I really don't think so. If the title had Trump, deport, and Africans in the same title no matter what else it said people would be flipping their shit.

t1_duiki3o	0.632200	*	Surrender? Do you mean commit to not seeking an autonomous area within Syrias current borders?  My understanding is that Kurds and Assad have largely steered clear of one another so far.

t1_dv1oq7m	-0.153100	*	Similar probably, it just refers to a place where it's dangerous for police to patrol and people to go to. Most countries have areas like this.  
t1_dun6l4h	-0.679000	*	So you're saying killing each other sporadically with guns and bombs is good for evolution but sick/weak people dying because of weakness isn't. What.

t1_dujn649	0.510600	*	If you ignore anonymous internet comments and take crowd sizes at ralleys as a indicator for public opinion, I think its pretty clear what the public wants. 
t1_dv0vz00	-0.585900	*	I keep hearing that argument and it feels a bit like an insult to the Chinese people. I know it's not meant to be, but saying well they couldn't do it even if they tried sounds insulting.

t1_duj5n60	0.708900	*	Ah yes, I remember watching a very good [documentary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5Tc_cbgxhc) about it.
t1_dugr6r1	0.000000	*	So the president has the maturity level of an edgy highschool student.
t1_dv2tk0o	-0.250000	*	The propaganda is the whole stack of it. It's either made up or hyped up.
t1_duqb6kk	0.000000	*	Correct, unless he somehow meets the reincarnation of Elizabeth Bathory who joins in on all of it
t1_duu9wds	0.420100	*	Totally agree. 
t1_dund6pv	0.000000	*	A plastic straw takes up to 200 years to decompose. I'd imagine hemp takes less than 30 if it's mostly pure.
t1_duxs875	-0.784500	*	Sigh... the Hillary kills people conspiracy theories are getting *really* old.  It's just Russian shmuck-bait.
t1_duhdwkv	-0.509600	*	You answered your own question, though, kinda. So what?, you ask, while acknowledging it's not good to share all your data. 
t1_dun30xs	0.444900	*	if you post leftist stuff, they won't ban you  notice all of the anti-Trump, anti-American stuff that is always on the front page
t1_dvqppvi	0.076200	*	That doesn't answer the question. I asked why would they go into careers that they can't pay their bills with?
t1_dutlj5b	-0.118900	*	It's not because of medicine.  The Plague was from the flea on a rat.. It's people eating cleaner and being more sanitary that stopped that.  This has nothing to do with vaccines.
t1_dv46jr5	0.000000	*	Tony 'knobhead' Abbot. 
t1_dv0tsg6	-0.476700	*	You got any other stupid things you want to say?
t1_dum6mhl	-0.510600	*	Can confirm, my father served as First Lt. Aboard CVN70, I also got to go on several tiger cruises aboard her when I was a child. Boats big as fuck.
t1_duzhykd	-0.526700	*	[Were you asleep when we had the last Republican president?](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/bushisms/2009/01/ws_greatest_hits.html)    They have a fetish for stupid.  
t1_dv2dpwu	-0.296000	*	If Clinton was in office, what you are saying would matter. She isn't our president and my focus is on the current president. Not someone who lost the election.
t1_duqxz09	-0.400500	*	Castro's Cuba was very repressive and he put people* in concentration camps so...  Edit: *specifically homosexuals
t1_dunudym	0.000000	*	Whose to say the population has dropped 90%? You been snorkeling with a clip board lately?
t1_dusym3m	-0.369100	*	Yeah.  It's totally your fault that your friend stole a truck last night.  (See the idiocracy of punishing others and not the ones doping??)

t1_duvz0te	0.296000	*	ok so this isn't necessarily the new norm, just a temporary change in the weather patterns?
t1_duk15xl	-0.177900	*	Borderline? He only ran for President out of a deep seated desire for revenge.
t1_dui6ff5	-0.743000	*	Less people would be murdered in the States if this was corrected than if all guns disappeared over night.

t1_dv00bq2	-0.781400	*	My grandparents fled Russia during the Bolshevik revolution and moved to South Africa. I'm glad my parents got the hell out of there in the 70s so I don't have to deal with this shit now. 
t1_duxoc7x	0.000000	*	It's probably more a question of if Trump listens to his advisors or not. If he does, he won't do it, otherwise...
t1_dv08e30	0.000000	*	*quietly removes Berlin from Eurotrip list*
t1_duhphzq	-0.209500	*	No it doesn't. It has zero effect.  We don't go around cutting out tonsils on the proviso that you just might get an infection.
t1_durd3bn	0.102700	*	I'm sure the Boomers had the same sentiment back in the early 70's when The Limits to Growth came out. Too bad they didn't do more then. Will we be the same?

t1_dv5ftdu	0.624900	*	A great deal, if not a majority, of america gets this.  We are humans, and have the average human portion of idiots per 100.  Sometimes that 30pc takes the reigns though.  
t1_dupcpes	0.000000	*	Does not work this way, has never worked this way.
t1_duga96s	0.273200	*	Old people's sport. Experience >> fitness. Why would you need dope to compete against people in their 30s and 40s?

t1_duwaxza	0.454300	*	I think it's kind of misleading to go the other way and say a smaller brain is better, though? The size is less important than the makeup of a brain, but it's not completely unimportant
t1_duwzl8y	-0.226300	*	I agree, if this was a black guy or asian from America would it be any different? Nope its still sickening.

t1_dv3xqkf	0.086900	*	Oddly thats one of the big points of Art of the Deal. Both Ivanka and her dad are always banging on about it. Its not original to Trump although Im sure he thinks it is 
t1_dv4w801	-0.131600	*	You dont care so... worry about your own EU and the issues you have over there. Its just another karma grab by pandering to the leftists on here. Cya!

t1_duoshyr	0.734600	*	More like cheques and balances  Edit: ok just realised that cheque is the British spelling so I probably just made the same joke
t1_dugs0gd	-0.796000	*	This had made many people very angry and has been widely regarded as a bad move.
t1_duxikwg	0.000000	*	Because it can be assumed that he's not the one grandstanding about women's rights in the US etc.

t1_duw14l3	0.000000	*	Nope, I never had kids. I saw, and spoke of methane clathrate in the 80s as a fuel to eliminate the middle East oil.  Not bringing up kids in this world.

t1_dv2gz25	0.598400	*	If we have to pay tariffs and importers don't, it's not free. Trump has repeatedly said FAIR trade. USA isn't going to be ripped off anymore. 
t1_dv35exa	0.000000	*	I have been. I have been for two years. I think I will be for another two years, and unless people focus on actual issues, another four years.

t1_dupyd7k	-0.936300	*	We know rape is under reported, so the number of reported rapes can't be used to show the prevalence of rape.

t1_ducfduv	0.000000	*	I did read the article. But Twitter saying so isn't a methodology. How is Twitter determining which accounts are Russian bots?

t1_duzzj6p	-0.318200	*	Considering that Cape Town is about to run out of water. That may be a major trigger for the tension that has built up

t1_ducjmy9	0.296000	*	Lol. Russia set up events (protests and counter protests) for far rightists and far leftists. Both sides are falling for it. 
t1_dv0lwmj	0.000000	*	How would you feel if a journalist publicly compared you to people who do what is shown in those images? And how would you respond?
t1_ducjla7	0.000000	*	You are now the moderator of /r/HailCorporate 
t1_durqk00	0.440400	*	The Russian military certainly knew where the Americans were, they have regular communications to avoid accidental engagement.    Who knows what they told the mercenaries though.
t1_dummvad	0.916900	*	Yeah. We take the best and the brightest to design our stuff and make our society run better. And pay everyone else as little as possible to make it happen cheaply.
t1_duxka9t	0.000000	*	I've described the stereotypical actions of lesser countries, in case you couldn't tell. Pooping in the streets is India, that one doesn't get much publicity. The rest should be obvious

t1_dv4wly0	-0.238200	*	It's not outlawed because we need it even though it's dirty. It may not be necessary for cars but the transportation industry needs it to haul heavy loads around the globe. 
t1_dv374zo	-0.361200	*	The fact that you lumped T_D together with all of the other political subs as if their offenses are even *remotely* similar shows how genuinely deluded the Trump voter base really is.
t1_durnvnk	-0.659700	*	I thought the constitution says something about guns being a right for a well-managed militia or something.  Are Americans arguing that every single gun owner in America is in a militia?
t1_duh3d2b	0.273200	*	Well it could happen.  Just not anytime soon.
t1_duizw8c	0.421500	*	Funnily enough, it only prevents the federal gov't from putting sailors in our homes, its not incorporated to the states so they technically COULD :o

t1_dv2pnkh	-0.128000	*	Canada is considered part of the US Defense Industrial Base, so sorta by definition Canadian steelmakers can't be considered a national security threat any more than Georgian or Pennsylvanian steel
t1_duuywbu	0.550500	*	Correct. In Trump's mind, every single person in this nation loves him. If they don't, that's fake news, and is simultaneously Crooked Hillary's fault.

t1_dv3gcax	-0.241100	*	Here is the kicker. The main page claims Russia trolled reddit. From 20 antirussian posts on the main page, I am not sure, what kind of influence Russia has over reddit . Just common sense

t1_duem536	0.234400	*	Probably South Korea just like West Germany was economically much stronger than East Germany. Yet I doubt there are a lot of Germans who would say unifying the country was not worth it.
t1_dueszey	0.648600	*	The pro-Russian shills downvoting you are hilarious. You only need to look at a GDP per capita map of Europe to see the benefits of being in the American orbit compared to the Russian one.

t1_dua9qck	0.165500	*	> it's also how the UK government has handled it.  To be fair, the Torry + DUP House majority is anything but a government.

t1_dv52zav	0.162100	*	Agreed. The way to win is to be loud. The greedy rich are the ones who are destroying the world and at root cause of most of the problems humanity faces. Looking at you Charles Koch. 
t1_duyfkve	0.000000	*	However, much paper packaging is actually multilayer, particularly for foodstuffs. You have to check for the recyclable label. 
t1_duqwbbh	0.202300	*	Which is why Russia rigged the election.  They had these deals on the table and they wanted to make damn sure they won.

t1_duhc8uz	0.340000	*	I liked Bush, voted for him, and supported going into Iraq. I was also young, idealistic, and had a simplistic view of right and wrong.  Now I see it as the biggest voting mistake I ever made.

t1_dum750d	0.585900	*	It's unlikely that Yesh Atid can hold a coalition by itself. If Lapid manages to win he'll probably have to form a unity government with Gabbay or the new Likud leader (I'd imagine Erdan).

t1_duhdfxe	-0.771700	*	Witch trials in England were actually pretty sparse and civil compared to those on the continent.  You want to see the real horror of witch hunts?  Look at witch hunts in the Holy Roman Empire.

t1_duhgftm	0.787600	*	Yeah, but that's kinda the point of wikipedia - it's an honour system. But if you wanted to be careful you could always verify with a hash that it's at least the same version as the online one.

t1_dv0ipb2	0.665200	*	How are all your nukes feeding you? GDP isn't doing so hot either but army is important. Looks like the next North Korea.

t1_dv3o8as	0.000000	*	You do know that unions *are* the left, at least economically.  Therefore, by being more interventionist, Trump is becoming a leftie.
t1_dv2oj1q	-0.571900	*	Nobody wins a trade war. It's bad for everyone involved.
t1_duk88jc	0.624900	*	Actually a great idea
t1_duzk38s	0.659700	*	As far as I can see, all they changed was the guys hair and apparently the number of things on the pizza, otherwise it's pretty much a straight trace job.

t1_duc95qv	0.177900	*	Stop making it profitable for them to hunt orangutans.
t1_dv1p8ce	0.636900	*	Probably yes. Fundamental, EU-wide decisions like this, membership of nations, etc require every country.
t1_duaa285	0.636900	*	I don't know about your house, but our doorstep is generally at our door. Not 50 meters away from it. :P
t1_dua88mj	-0.585900	*	I think you're missing the point. Why am I having to fight off anyone?
t1_duxo6qa	0.807400	*	I can easily guarantee the results for any party that campaigns with the promise to decriminalize all drugs. Elections are next year, watch as no politician of significance brings up the issue.
t1_duucybv	0.000000	*	Baristas are actually health mages
t1_dv5hkax	0.000000	*	How is this even REMOTELY correct? Google a map of Polonia , you'll see that Poland's borders are essentially the same since the Roman Empire. Fucking Kraut-loving westerner

t1_dumy94y	0.000000	*	Pants magic pants
t1_duz9mao	0.639800	*	Yeah because the result matters. If your country can't get shit done because it has to haggle about everything for decades it is essentially a dysfunctional political system.

t1_duz7g1g	0.000000	*	Legacy costs, everyone's a financial conservative on the subject of government spending, just getting an infrastructure project off the ground can take years, and corruption inevitably follows. 
t1_dui9ox0	0.680800	*	Yeah he isn't. The way he talks, you would not expect him to be one of the richest man in the world. He's very down to earth.
t1_dv32d7y	-0.421500	*	Sad the can is required in that sentence. 
t1_dv3tb3o	-0.763100	*	It's just mostly in my area, we're pretty overpopulated. I can't really blame it on everything that's going on, but it's just frustration after frustration.

t1_dubxi8a	0.272400	*	Thats a really good question actually.  Ive only ever considered trees in regard to carbon dioxide scrubbing (if thats what its even called), but I dont know if they can filter other gases
t1_duno9su	-0.341200	*	Turns out human rights aren't profitable *anywhere.*

t1_dv1leoi	-0.373600	*	Arent honey bees killing off many other pollinator species? Why should we care about them?
t1_dv00r9i	-0.599400	*	A revolution isnt revenge though. You dont hang all the leaders in anger, you do it because its the only way to save the country.
t1_durl5ew	-0.526700	*	The FBI cannot and should not dictate who can run for office, and who can be on a campaign. The FBI just needs to investigate criminal activity and charge people when appropriate. 
t1_dusw2j1	-0.584800	*	Via all the 'voluntary' tax returns they get, of course!  (If you fail to specify another option that money goes automatically to the Catholic Church).
t1_dux84lj	-0.077200	*	It's far more complicated than that. Nazi scientists were just as useful and equally escaped punishment. 
t1_duf50op	-0.648600	*	Sounds about right. Only thing I would add is that this is Wales, so expect that but with hills, a toxic estuary, a coal mine, and a million sheep.   Oh, and heroin.
t1_dusk8al	0.690100	*	Yes the fucking yes
t1_due0w47	-0.659700	*	these things happen. Many space pioneers didn't make it home. That awful fire in the command module during apollo 1 training comes to mind.

t1_duxcvmm	0.618400	*	If it's legal means it's safe. That's what most people think. Legalization would not be a good idea. Look at alcohol being legal. People don't understand how dangerous alcohol is until its too late.

t1_dv0jnsq	-0.077200	*	> Le Pen would happily sue and restrict the speech of people she disagrees with if she had the power.  Proof?

t1_dv2swek	0.677800	*	You do realize you said EVEN IF it is the most profitable situation for a to trade with b, it's STILL more profitable for a to trade with b! Crazy! Not taking sides just pointing it out.
t1_duwr1yg	-0.509500	*	Thats not what I am saying. I was just looking for confirmation on the matter. It would be absolutely terrible if it happened. 
t1_dujbpj4	0.318200	*	Speaking of Costco, they just got a fresh load of desalination plants in stock.
t1_duku70z	0.000000	*	Happens when you use civilians as meat shields.

t1_dv4b9tt	-0.421500	*	Internet machine broke
t1_durw38u	-0.460100	*	This. This is very important thing to anyone whos level-headed. Remember the pandering to terrorists, unforgivable. 
t1_dui3qvf	0.250000	*	If I dream in a British accent does that mean I've become fluid in their native tongue? 
t1_duq2lgi	-0.827100	*	That's probably accurate. By a loose definition, 100% of all human beings have been harassed. People suck 
t1_dv01zia	-0.557400	*	Nasty Woman?

t1_dur74r1	-0.470700	*	Not sure why your being downvoted. The article states she has an interim security clearance. Unfortunately I'm not surprised though, most of Reddit just reads the headline to fuel their Trump hate.
t1_dv38s4s	-0.921700	*	Trump may have groped or raped a few women, adult women who choose to have sex for money. Obomba drone striked and killed many hundreds of people. In your opinion, which is worse?

t1_dutrief	0.597500	*	Taiwan is hardly comparable to Crimea though.   It'd be more like, if Russia had annexed the entire Ukraine, and that Ukraine also happened to be far more important to the world economy.
