t1_dtx9bj2	-0.273200	*	Are you saying the sanctions discouraged them to develop nukes? If so, the opposite is true, they got a reactor and then used it as a bargaining chip to stop the sanctions. 
t1_dtce6it	-0.309400	*	How would you use the forces properly?  How does immigration and customs solve the problem?
t1_dtqvu7g	-0.177900	*	Iirc the military protects their electronics, so it'd only be there civilian electronics that go down.  It would be chaos, but we could nuke whomever we wanted before dealing with it

t1_dtbvuos	-0.875000	*	Exactly. No one reacts to hundreds of people dying in in Eastern Ukraine, because it's a war zone and we except these things to happen in war zones. 
t1_dt0u951	0.000000	*	Im aware
t1_dtqnkvx	-0.401900	*	How is that satire? He's broken many laws. He's admitted to it. On live television. He deserves to be impeached and that much is absurdly obvious.

t1_dsyx59i	-0.848300	*	That's exactly the problem. There **isn't** a free market on healthcare in the US. If there was the prices would be as low as in other free market healthcare nations such as in India or Thailand.

t1_dsurw23	-0.557400	*	This is the same in any country. Some of the biggest visa overstayers in Australia are Brits. I don't expect Australia to ban UK citizens from obtaining visas.
t1_dsjvkh6	0.361200	*	Everyone who has *had* to stand their ground has had to do it against people like you calling them idiots. Does that mean they're right? Time will tell.

t1_dshdsmo	0.361200	*	They offer plans that they know will be rejected because a two-state solution is not what Israel wants.  Tell me, making Jerusalem the capital, is that a move towards peace?

t1_dtjjrms	0.000000	*	That's not how it works either. 
t1_dt8r3ti	0.571900	*	It's funny that when women exceed men it's framed as 'barriers lifting, women reaching their potential'. But when men exceed women it's due to oppression. 
t1_dsss4wp	-0.883400	*	It doesn't take many believers to cause a level of death and destruction that I'm not comfortable with if they were strapping 7 year olds with bombs.

t1_dsusqfh	-0.762900	*	Whataboutism. No one is claiming that something shouldn't be done to combat companies from hoarding money overseas. The two situations aren't mutually exclusive. You can dislike both at the same time.

t1_dtilmgw	-0.458800	*	Reality is dangerously left-winged. 
t1_dsemupz	0.479900	*	It really is not the same as impeachment, but Prime Ministers and the President of the United States are in totally different political positions to begin with. Its almost not worth comparing. 
t1_dsqxd6z	0.645800	*	If nobody gains anything, then there is probably not a conspiracy there. It can often happen that what someone gains is that someone else loses something.

t1_dstmkqc	-0.831600	*	Besides the Gaza and Lebanon war, or before that when Iraq shot rockets into Israel. Or the fact they are still at war with Syria

t1_dt5exrz	0.587500	*	I had a guy trying to break into my house. I called the cops and they just said its not a crime unless he actually gets inside and they never bothered to come. I'm in Canada. 
t1_dsp1r74	0.718400	*	Unfortunately I dont think the world is run by peace loving practical people 
t1_dt0hatf	0.000000	*	Its not quite that. Its that the Saudis are a major customer of NATO arms manufacturers while the Houthis arent. Almost the entirety of SAs arms come from NATO.
t1_dsq9if4	0.000000	*	Arent palestinians mostly jews who converted to islam? Along with arab migrants after the conquest?

t1_dsl1jqw	-0.369500	*	What about you?  Does being a dick online make you feel good?  Does it give you satisfaction to tell people to fuck off?
t1_dsjv9xg	-0.695600	*	Yeah but you have public healthcare so therefore to American politicians you are basically full-blown communists.  Source: British person who still occasionally gets asked about Death Panels.
t1_dszsbq4	0.273200	*	Well, in British English its usually reversed - double quotes only when within single quotes

t1_dt7w74v	-0.526700	*	It's a psychological issue, similar to how plane crashes look disastrous compared to road accidents. Yet the first is much safer than the latter.

t1_dt8zlw7	0.611300	*	Lmfao, responding to me from your alt account. Why so defensive?
t1_dtp5ytd	0.726900	*	But they are being backed by some pretty big political venture capitalists in the likes of Jeffrey Katzenberg.
t1_dt8saol	0.000000	*	Because the IB times is a very reliable news source, they don't just make things up, they do background checks before they run any stories to verify the source.

t1_dt2cfmm	0.642800	*	The difference is that in the United States, you're permitted to have different values without being hunted by the state. Maybe it's all well and good in Beijing, but what about Tibet?
t1_dsvhqii	-0.708100	*	Stealing money from other people doesn't generate growth. Just look at welfare programs all over the world, specially in the U.S. They all lead to stagnation.
t1_dttdth7	0.735100	*	I think the USA truly is the land of the free. But it does not apply to people. It applies to corporations and businesses.
t1_dtwv5er	0.757200	*	I am no fan of the Democratic Party, but to attempt to compare the toxicity of the two is an injustice, not just to the Democratic party but, more importantly, to the people of the United States.

t1_dsj2rmf	0.401900	*	In the netherlands he is rightwing and conservative. When looking at the actual voting behaviour in the (tweede kamer, where they vote about laws, budget and policy) this can be clearly seen.
t1_dtckq96	0.000000	*	You are right there are too many people. You should voluntarily go extinct.

t1_dte74c9	-0.205700	*	 That is the crux of it though. His legitimacy is based on the economy and the economy in Russia is not doing well. 
t1_dt76ac4	-0.778300	*	Ah, there's one part of this discussion you have failed to understand. I think you are a bad actor and will simply dismiss anything I provide. 
t1_dtjedm3	0.476700	*	He's correct though (about US industrialists anyway). I don't have the sources offhand, but they can be researched easily enough.
t1_dslvjwk	-0.599400	*	Do they realize how many Japanese die if we invade?

t1_dtajwgi	-0.153100	*	Sure, Senator McCarthy, that sounds very reasonable. The obse4ssion with Russian espionage is a mass hysteria and nothing more.
t1_dtur7p0	0.000000	*	The Holocaust laws exist, because its such an undeniable unquestionable fact, that the only people that claim that it was a 'holohoax' are neonazis and people with anti-jewish agendas.

t1_dsdkwei	-0.144200	*	Well, in Delhi, the BJP MCD is the exact opposite and does its level best to f**k things up. This is the thing with the BJP, when not in power, it plays very dirty. No rules dirty. Absolute pigs.
t1_dtd0r8g	-0.822500	*	It's this big time. A New Zealander was killed in this attack and it's made breaking news down here.
t1_dsklh9p	0.000000	*	I think about 40 to 45 percent between federal and state income tax.  If you count all the property and sales taxes it's probably over half.

t1_dswn5a5	0.486700	*	I was a Trump supporter but you cannot say that Hillary won the primary fairly. I don't care what your politics are but it was absolute corruption. Everyone who followed the election knew it.
t1_dtgozyo	0.599400	*	honestly id be surprised if R&D arent in on it together at this point. I mean trump and clintion had ties to Russia.. 
t1_dtoezc4	-0.659700	*	No shit, it was a shock to everyone that it passed. How much of that has it recovered since then?    I like how you took one slice out of everything I said and ignored the rest lol.
t1_dt13zu5	0.873700	*	More like the US takes care of most of Germanys defense, and the EU in general. Which is why they do not need to care. NATO, look it up.

t1_dswk6fv	0.899400	*	The government can't murder you but that doesn't mean we have to provide for your every need.  Seems pretty consistent. Have a kid, take care of the kid.
t1_dtbs2df	0.421500	*	lol
t1_dsk5lr6	0.585900	*	That's not the concern. The Secret Service does their own checks, walkthroughs, security screens, everything, regardless of whoever's already doing it. It's basically double the security.
t1_dsva0m0	0.235400	*	I'm not sure why this is getting downvoted. Thanks for doing what you did

t1_dth2sob	0.624900	*	Because voters do care about it which means anyone who has copies of the tape has blackmail material they can use to coerce the POTUS.  That's something people who care about America are bothered by.

t1_dss487o	0.680800	*	Still with the absolute conclusions, eh?   Using IQ to measure the complex nuance of human intelligence is like using a stick to measure the depth of the ocean.

t1_dsnngyk	-0.594500	*	So your whole argument is, well nothing has happened yet.   Also, as a millennial who pays taxes, I'm getting screwed on this bill. So try again.
t1_dsmy7vv	0.361200	*	I just like wolves.
t1_dslql2g	-0.183200	*	Hardly any downside. Banning them as a food altogether has a much bigger impact.

t1_dsk5wfo	0.062400	*	The open borders people like you advocate doesn't help me.
t1_dsz5oqz	0.000000	*	That's right.  If you take some personal responsibility you can get world class healthcare here.  If you expect someone else to do everything for you then this is not the place to be.

t1_dtwimfa	0.718400	*	The same way any American should feel. If the reports are true. Hes in the same boat as hillary in my eyes. I care about America, not politicians. 
t1_dtny6p3	-0.670500	*	They'll literally lie about abuses of power as long as they think it will help their team. It's crappy.  Reading the memo takes 5 minutes. Everyone should do it.

t1_dt90j44	0.458800	*	>Sure, I would agree.  So you agree you should have checked on what you were talking about about, and why should it not be directed at you when you just agreed you should have checked and were wrong.

t1_dtr9kbj	0.592700	*	Yeah, but https://digg.com/spy doesn't exist and the site isn't what it used to be.  It just looks like yahoo.com now.

t1_dt68rph	0.269500	*	I don't disagree that it is a conspiracy theory, I'm just surprised at how little evidence there is given the attention the mainstream media is constantly giving it.
t1_dtp3e4s	-0.226300	*	You likely only believe this because you agree with CNN's bias and disagree with FOX's bias.

t1_dtawcng	-0.458800	*	Nobody should have been surprised by the original 300% ruling.  The US does it all the time.  A US company complains, US puts massive tariff on it, WTO/ITC rules tariff illegal and fines them.

t1_dtg4use	0.000000	*	The only reason the media covers it that way is because if they don't people will just turn into a TV station which is.
t1_dsyvqt3	-0.371600	*	There's a difference between healthcare and healthcare system. The US has some of the best healthcare in the world, but a terrible healthcare system that makes it prohibitively expensive.

t1_dtk4e97	-0.493900	*	You are mistaken. Not all Americans profit from all these wars. Only a few and those who are apart of the whole military industrial complex. A lot of us don't get anything from it.  
t1_dsksocg	-0.457400	*	He played up that idiot persona even before he was President. The idiot persona resonates with common Americans. He's just like us! I'd have a beer with him.

t1_dtcsa9u	0.174400	*	Human nature is to adapt to our environment. We believe we are inherently greedy and selfish due to the nature of our socioeconomic system. Greed is not only rewarded, but celebrated in our system.
t1_dsg13kd	-0.398700	*	Oh please. Im not taking credit for anything, just pointing out that he was shitting on American intervention when he benefited from it.  Also, that France was at least 2 government revolutions ago.

t1_dt9oy0o	0.361200	*	people have been trying to map the Trumps to the Bluths, and as it turns out, it looks like Donald is Buster. Just give him grilled cheese.
t1_dsfus3m	0.444900	*	Yea I know what you're saying. I know it's not a big issue. Just think NK really does not give a shit about the Olympics you know?

t1_dtggsgp	-0.197000	*	I really hope the majority of the protestors don't think this way. Because if so that would be one of the most ridiculous protests in history.
t1_dt5pm3a	-0.075700	*	People make holocaust jokes in every thread that is even remotely related to Germany, and that one wasn't even that great as far as holocaust jokes go.

t1_dtpv33o	-0.273200	*	Not surprising. Russians bomb everything that breathes. So when they are captured they are *not* treated fairly 
t1_dtbwfad	-0.746900	*	I dont think T_D was in full swing yet (I mightve just still been innocent) but breaking news on Reddit seemed to die with the pulse nightclub shooting

t1_dtpddsu	0.715300	*	> fairly obviously didn't see nor want any nuance.  that can't necessarily be inferred.  If that were true I could say the same of you honestly. Each person stated singular views of the same issue.
t1_dssfes5	0.401900	*	Litteraly yes. 
t1_dtauvj3	0.502300	*	There are a lot of things you can rightfully call China out on, but eating dogs isn't more barbaric than, say, a pig roast just because you like dogs. 
t1_dt8usoa	0.077200	*	Sure...partly because I want to see exactly what a moonstache is.
t1_dsjdskj	0.400300	*	My government isn't my press though, and unlike a certain oompa loompa, my government isn't petty so it's unlikely to get involved.

t1_dt7rer7	0.102700	*	Probably not in the same places, no. And we have exhausted all the great spots for it anyway.

t1_dtwjmh6	-0.440400	*	And with the recent deepfakes scandal, literally everyone could have video of Trump fucking a midget. 
t1_dskyhv3	0.885400	*	So what.  Those people should never feel trapped into staying in their birth country.  Giving talented people more options for where they can live in the world is 100% a good thing.

t1_dt9mrww	0.510600	*	Go look at where MTU is located, who developed the engine of the Altay which Turkey is building under license. Have fun building tanks without an engine when that license is revoked...
t1_dskyhvy	-0.153100	*	The guy spends most of his presidency playing golf ffs. He doesn't do anything of value, all the real work he just delegates out to his staff. He'll just do whatever the republicans tell him to do.
t1_dtbsrr5	-0.264900	*	That all depends on whether or not we classify brown people as innocent people. We don't even bother getting accurate statistics on how many we've killed. 
t1_dslwstc	0.000000	*	I mean, I guess it's a little closer than Chinese or Japanese. Maybe someday you'll get asked if you're Cambodian.

t1_dtpuke5	0.153100	*	Ironically, being a nazi ally made it easier to deal with things as the country wanted to. Japan, not just Chiune Sugihara, refused to follow nazi recommendations for handling Jews.

t1_dstr4jv	0.741600	*	Well is made for the purpose that bachh2 described, a neutral flag for both countries. I wouldn't call it lame, I would call it simplistic, and that's not necessarily a bad thing.  But each their own.
t1_dtghghv	0.619900	*	Then wouldn't that make this a case for the Supreme Court to hear? If we're unsure if this is well within the POTUS power, we can use them to define what the proper course of action is, right?
t1_dst91ed	-0.665200	*	Being arrested for racial abuse isn't creepy, it's a crime. U0001f603
t1_dshvpai	0.904400	*	Im glad the vid you linked was China Uncensored.   They do a great job.   For anyone whos even marginally interested in China/how China affects the World, definitely check out China Uncensored.

t1_dssv7mc	-0.340000	*	Please do dig out your 60 year old example of a man who was in the kkk 100 years ago. Sooooo relevant. Pathetic.

t1_dsoforl	0.000000	*	I suppose that minus the deals with oligarchs(idk, is Tillerson an oiligarch?), they are fairly similar. I assumed it was Rex, incorrectly

t1_dt4rhh8	0.855500	*	Oh come off it. Both Bernie Sanders and Trump agreed that TPP was trash for Americans and only good for exporting jobs.   I'm sorry we couldn't ass fuck the American worker more with a steel rod.

t1_dttnf2s	0.000000	*	Everywhere but in Germany and Austria it sort of Is. The British equivalent propably would be slave owning looters of India and Africa. But Nazi is a lot catchier if you ask me.
t1_dt8ovyo	0.000000	*	I didnt say that. I said not having civil marriage. Having rabbis and muftis and clergymen dictate our marriage responsibilities, our inheritance etc... makes a country non-secular.

t1_dsrbbog	0.000000	*	Counterpoint: crimes against or caused by Muslims are a hot-topic issue. The media aren't using less fact-checking with these kind of topics, they're just reporting more frequently.

t1_dsg5ifn	0.000000	*	Esquimalt and Royal roads are not rural at all. X men movies were filmed at Royal roads University. It's directly beside the capital city of BC (my home). What do you think rural means? Not Vancouver?

t1_dshrx2v	0.815100	*	At all my past jobs, I earned paid vacations.  Sure I had days off, but an incentive to stay was paid vacation.   I never had to clock out for a bathroom break or whatever, but lunch breaks, yes.

t1_dsvazjv	-0.594000	*	The Alt Right is not Nazi. It is white identity and white nationalism. Do you think America was a diverse ethnic butterfly in the 1930s? I thought the previous generations were all racists?

t1_dtl1x5l	0.000000	*	Asian, Arab, kind of similar when you're running for your life. Darker than white folks, but not black. Pakistani are very Asian looking, being on the border with India.

t1_dsm1nzo	0.648600	*	Idk, seems like a pretty common topic of conversation. Then again I'm not an ethnic minority so I don't know what goes into experiencing that on the other side. 
t1_dsokm3q	0.440400	*	This is the answer I was looking for.  I dont know why everyone downvoted me for asking. Thanks though.
t1_dtipg23	-0.806200	*	I get your sentiment. I just don't see any other way though while we are at war.  Can you elaborate on it creating more unnecessary problems on the battlefield?

t1_dt76scd	-0.086500	*	So, if you want to meet people, what would you say is the right way to approach them, if compliments are considered harrassment (not lewd shit, just a standard compliment)?
t1_dskym34	-0.825700	*	don't say that, if he hears he's not the best at being the worst, he'll try harder to be the bestest worstest president ever. A stable genius can do it with no trouble, if properly encouraged.

t1_dtsrjnd	0.891000	*	Covering views like Nazism is the entire point of free speech. Free speech laws arent there to protect speech you agree with. Or do you disagree with the most fundamental of human rights?
t1_dsw2v6l	-0.296000	*	Scandinavian countries are totally socialist. You should probably stop saying socialist and just start saying communist

t1_dtj88dy	-0.502300	*	Idk man, I cut off my ears too, now I don't have to clean behind those either.        Next, I'll remove my teeth. It decreases chances for cavities!

t1_dslz5mb	0.000000	*	Ok...
t1_dt03yy2	-0.190100	*	Either that or extremely high luck in how the events unfolded, Ive seen TV crime documentaries where the crimes almost seemed like something else which is a bad comparison but anythings possible.
t1_dtb19rk	0.000000	*	Mexican standoff
t1_dst2aw0	-0.709600	*	Many groups have lived there.  No one group had a rightful claim but if anything the palestinians have forfeited any claim they had thru embracing terror and refusing good offers.

t1_dtcy0ih	-0.859100	*	A political argument about who should administer Jerusalem is *not* antisemitism. Arguing anything else is just insulting my intelligence.  ...But yelling death to jews is.

t1_dtn8iai	0.000000	*	I'd respect him a tiny bit if he could admit error. He bears no accountability.
t1_dth8601	-0.318200	*	Wait. I'm confused. I thought you couldn't comment?
t1_dskk8gy	0.571900	*	Ok I was just clarifying what he said because you went off on a strange tangent about the free press.
t1_dsdaul8	-0.910000	*	> They were brutal because they were brutal  Yeah, but why were people choosing to take inferior, dangerous drugs? Because the safer ones were banned. 
t1_dsovp38	-0.051600	*	Your comment made so much sense that it immediately ruined that movie for me. Thanks,  I guess

t1_dtp3h0o	-0.690800	*	The thing about Canada is that its very large with lots of forests so if we ever get invaded we could do some serious damage through guerrilla warfare.

t1_dsz7ka8	0.268100	*	Can't argue that.  Wish I had a solution.  More Standardized grading systems and Deeper statistical analysis rather than just end of course testing results might be a start.

t1_dsh9sbq	0.000000	*	You must be very new to Reddit.
t1_dst80eo	-0.153100	*	Classic reddit. We are watching a potential monumental event in American politics, one that will shape the Presidency forever, and it took two comments to get a Dumb and Dumber reference. I love it. 
t1_dtnxb0y	0.855500	*	I like to remind other nurses that dismiss statistics that Florence Nightingale was also an award winning statistician.

t1_dsso8k9	0.784500	*	Truly I was surprised such a base feeling got 4k up votes. But I also think you ascribe too much smarts to people.
t1_dsmknq0	-0.440400	*	The notion of the reasonable neutral is just as arbitrary as the notion that someone on the far left or right would be a snowflake. It still suffers from the same flaw of oversimplification.
t1_dtp4wgu	0.401900	*	[Here](http://www.tailsthroughtime.com/2010/12/soviet-wild-weasels-part-two-aircraft.html) is an interesting read on Soviet SEAD.

t1_dslbuga	-0.790600	*	Shootings vs grenades.  There are Somali and Afghan gangs at war with each other in Europe.   I mean it's just going to get worse. Considering you know, you imported the ones doing it mostly here.
t1_dthkiah	0.361200	*	Trump has been on the FBIs radar, not the other way around.  Just like Bernie Madoff was investigated 12 times over 18 years  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_Madoff

t1_dsny69d	-0.387500	*	Trump has followed Obamas actions and results in Syria, with the exception of not caring as much about civilian casualties. Not exactly a laudable accomplishment.

t1_dsh46p2	0.445800	*	Let's not pretend that China would survive just fine if all trade with the US would suddenly stop tomorrow. It's a HUGE market for them.
t1_dssmi5p	0.750000	*	How do you think she got that way ;)  North Korea, best Korea!
t1_dt2e9cu	-0.566700	*	I label the article that is used as source for what navalny is as propaganda.   Educate yourself before being so quick at denying factual evidence.
t1_dsvu03e	0.624900	*	Tide pods are The Great Filler
t1_dtg1vjj	0.000000	*	While I dont think this issue should have ever been put to referendum at least a 75+ year old experienced life before and after joining the EU and was actually around during the first referendum. 
t1_dsdydre	0.000000	*	The south still has laws on the books banning inter-racial marriage.   That gives you a more accurate picture, actual practice or what's in the books?

t1_dtlwv5z	-0.919200	*	the farm murders are more a rural crime problem than deliberate targeting of whites. Over 40% of the victims have been black.
t1_dtaz14w	0.361200	*	Like you never heard of a fund manager setting sail to Aruba?
t1_dt8q699	-0.719000	*	> That criticism applies to both data sets  Not really, a feeling is subjective. A death reported is a fact.
t1_dtwy5zo	0.421500	*	That really puts it into perspective. It is nice. 
t1_dtp2auq	-0.868900	*	It's similar to killing someone after they've surrendered or killing a chaplain or something. They're non-combatants.

t1_dtlhcfi	0.665200	*	Yeah, but i meant as far as having places to run highways. If you have the Nazca lines covering a good portion of your country the areas to run viable highways is probably less.
t1_dtvp09e	0.240100	*	Don't forget those terms too!

t1_dtp1h31	0.750600	*	American. Not true, those are two different things. If an American only knew one of those terms, I'm positive that it would be not-for-profit.
t1_dsxpjqm	-0.273200	*	At least it's gone to a low wage employee instead of the company. 
t1_dsfxg7e	-0.542300	*	So will everything else, its just a race to see what kills you faster.  
t1_dte2alf	0.177900	*	Good point about the tax cuts - with the government pulling in less money, we can afford this even less
t1_dslwd4x	-0.462800	*	Having a discussion with Alex Jones-level conspiratards is not how I want to waste my time.
t1_dssy5bl	-0.401900	*	Except that the agent is going to be tried in a court rather than being shot and dumped.
t1_dtgmaio	0.844200	*	I wonder if Citizens United and its aftermath could be used to impeach everyone on the Supreme Court who ruled in favor of it.  
t1_dtmb380	0.000000	*	[Yes.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humour)
t1_dtn8yew	0.557400	*	well i asked you to tell me the situation, and seeing that you've not said anything on the situation and had just given my example the thumbs up, I should say you agree with my comment?  
t1_dth4wb9	0.361200	*	Both countries sound like fuckwads to me.
t1_dsxt8ip	0.338400	*	Not really, I agree.  The difference is at least for now my taxes pay for it. 
t1_dsnigz6	-0.077200	*	Also it's a very small target, if lil Kimmy could actually reach that far there is no way he would be accurate. It's all a mind game to scare the shit out of us.
t1_dt1y4nu	0.475400	*	Mostly it becomes more efficient due to reduced cost of overhead. 
t1_dsqrl8s	0.000000	*	I meant already here as in America actually. *shrugs* and Im an American citizen so guess youre going to have to deal with it *shrug*
t1_dtair8d	0.700300	*	No worries, I at least have the freedom to defend myself in the event that I encounter an active shooter. I'll probably hit the lottery first though as my odds are better.

t1_dsiaj1b	0.000000	*	I would totally have read corpsman as corpse-man
t1_dsrtgoe	0.636900	*	I would think the person describing it as a small minority should point out why he believes that.  You know, support your claim....  If 1800 is a small minority like he claims, out of how many then?  
t1_dtbthn3	-0.361200	*	Its delusional to think that the US is the reason the middle east is unstable. Read a history book.
t1_dtrljlb	-0.542300	*	Why do social media sites toss out chronological order out when they get too big to fail?
t1_dt9cqrz	-0.340000	*	Pretty sure a rodeo clown would be fired for bragging about sexually assaulting coworkers on tape. 
t1_dsi44s3	-0.497300	*	I feel its a bit different tho. While I dont like /s, on the internet we cant use tone of voice and gesture like irl.
t1_dskc9nw	0.000000	*	> cites Washington Post  > next article claims WaPo is unreliable. 
t1_dtk8tix	0.564700	*	It may help their case but drugs which act on the immune system can become toxic when used in combination (fatal infections, cytokine storm, etc)
t1_dttp992	0.128000	*	I personally believe they did since their emissions were 40-60x the legal limit, only when road testing vs lab test. That's just my opinion. 
t1_dsmexwe	0.000000	*	Pinchy remembers.
t1_dtr8u6u	-0.116400	*	Because Islam is the one that gets shit on the most. Christianity for example doesn't get called a violent religion very often, so there isn't really much need to defend it.
t1_dsh4z2v	0.000000	*	Also why would we still have an appendix?
t1_dsjwf9q	0.000000	*	Socialist means something very different to Americans than it does to the rest of the world.

t1_dsi3xyf	-0.421500	*	Well that's because the Donald gets free reign to abuse reddit rules because the admins are afraid of what will happen if it gets banned. 
t1_dsnvfs4	0.488100	*	And don't forget he could also run for POTUS if he felt like it as he was born in America and still has US citizenship, so beware yanks we may just export him to you.... 
t1_dtgn48p	0.854100	*	It's just crazy how perfectly accurate he is in describing the state the country is in today... Racial and religious profiling? Yep we passed that one already. Kiss net neutrality goodbye? Yep.

t1_dstvjge	0.226300	*	A Google search says Trump's net worth is 3.1 billion and Batman's is 9.2 billion. Because we are talking billions, I would say their wealths are comparable.
t1_dtvdhs1	0.401900	*	Coulda woulda shoulda. Let's appreciate the small things.
t1_dt8ubuu	-0.807400	*	The Republican President is a rapist & Putin is a murderer.   You're whining about artistic freedom like a cowardly old religious nut?   
t1_dsk70r4	0.190100	*	It'll be just like Calamity Ganon, but orange instead of magenta, and instead of roaring, it will just bellow YUUUUUGE.
t1_dtoe8qg	0.000000	*	Why's that?
t1_dtfk86u	0.765000	*	But he encourages taking privilege away from rich and powerful and giving it to the poor. Must be a bad guy.
t1_dtpdk83	-0.526700	*	Same in Canada, its streaming.  Not illegal. There is no file downloaded and stored or shared.
t1_dt4d3vj	0.269500	*	> You think people don't criticize the US? You're wrong.  Youst be joking, If there us one thing Reddit shows well, its how americans are extreme nationalists.
t1_dtcu3e0	-0.862500	*	That selfish mindset is a big reason why the health of the planet will continue to deteriorate while it tries to sustain your ungrateful ass.

t1_dsimbgz	0.000000	*	Source?

t1_dtcbgnb	-0.226300	*	Oh for fuck's sake, Project Veritas has been making things up for *years*.  You're demanding a source for the sky being blue.
t1_dslvoui	0.000000	*	How would moving countries ever be designed cheaply? 
t1_dsl1c3v	0.153100	*	Because I did well.  Sure at the start, when he became president and inherited the mess from Bush it was pretty bad.  But the economy fucking flourished under him.  It's disingenuous to say otherwise
t1_dt1s5zr	0.000000	*	Are you eating mud?
t1_dshbjed	0.000000	*	Not unless/until an entity is willing to back a cryptocurrency with something tangible instead. This doesn't seem tangible without sacrificing some or even most of the decentralisation.

t1_dtsk2uj	0.510600	*	I feel like the only thing that would fix this is a Chinese style anti-corruption campaign.   Start at the top, and work your way down.

t1_dtvaxxy	0.102700	*	I'm okay with ppl doing whatever they want to. We're dangerously close to shaming people who get these procedures done in consent,  and I don't want to live in that kind of world. 
t1_dst2kpf	-0.557400	*	Suddenly conspiracy theories saying that the US is destabilising other countries in order to create conflict don't sound that far fetched.
t1_dtpsvtv	0.318200	*	Remember silicone is used to make breast and ass implants. If it's safe to shove inside your body, it's probably safe for other stuff too.
t1_dsor5po	0.234400	*	It's pretty well established that if the US had the capability of taking out a Sunburn, it wouldn't be so upset that Russia, China .. and Iran .. have them. 
t1_dtqlak8	0.440400	*	Good point.
t1_dtiyiff	0.000000	*	Scientology doesnt have shelters. If they did, homelessness would be cured by now and someone would be asking Tom Cruise, Wow, a homeless person. Youve actually met one of those? /s
t1_dta8ecp	0.742400	*	Fair enough. I will concede that the concept of free speech in general is a difficult thing to define. Which is probably why each country has defined it differently. Thanks for the open dialogue!

t1_dt2lczo	0.788200	*	The one place, lol. Ever been to Alabama?  Louisiana?    Tennessee?  Kentucky?  Kansas?  How about Arkansas or the Carolinas?  Also, Oklahoma, Georgia and Missouri are pretty religious.

t1_dshkoa7	0.000000	*	This predates Dunkin Donuts. It used to be that coffee with heavy cream and sugar was known as Boston Style. 
t1_dszqvp0	-0.557400	*	I argue this. In a time of crisis any form of currency won't do you any good.
t1_dt2atr4	0.000000	*	I mean.  It's also treason. I think he should have been protected too. 
t1_dsy29cq	-0.599400	*	Because it screws over people who benefit from government programs and fosters a culture of tax avoidance that leads to a collapse in government funding.

t1_dtwtx0g	0.082600	*	No, but you never see the ignorant stereotype used on any other nation, so it might as well be what it means. 
t1_dt7m6b9	-0.716200	*	None of this matters because Kim is just using all this as a stall tactic because he's worried Trump will attack.

t1_dt19cxp	0.297500	*	almost like that's the goal
t1_dsjagw7	-0.476700	*	They have, it happened in his only press conference as President. He brought up having the most electoral college votes and got roasted how it was wrong.
t1_dsjvh4e	-0.840200	*	Stop. It's too logical, you'll hurt his brain.   No one's every said all guns should be taken away. If they have they are clueless. Regulation is all people want. A basic IQ test could be a start.

t1_dt0wfkf	-0.401900	*	The point is the laws are oppressive because of Islam. Do you think all 250 million Indonesians we're born wanting to follow Islam? 
t1_dti68xb	-0.128000	*	You think Africa is just lions running around eating people? Even if it we're, these lions were in captivity. He shot them in a cage like a coward.

t1_dta1olv	-0.574700	*	It's not that they just don't like the name, Nazi is like the N-Word of Germany. And if you support calling people Nazi's, you just prove to be a moron.
t1_dt6b7xs	-0.296000	*	No. It's a very filthy thing to say. I don't see how what he said years before his presidency is **actively** fueling an atmosphere against women.
t1_dtnvxva	-0.623200	*	Who gives a shit if it is badly written?  Lots of things are.    We don't folks bitching about it in a top level comment.

t1_dtdutol	0.000000	*	Of course it does, any ideology based solely on the theft of workers' labor, and governmental policies protecting that theft, is corrupt to the core.
t1_dtm9d1j	-0.296000	*	D'oh no, they call it steamed hems up in Washington. Its a regional dialect.

t1_dsi78ac	0.526700	*	I disagree. Free markets naturally seek a distribution of power. The only way power becomes concentrated in monopolies is with the intervention and support of government regulation.

t1_dsko613	0.568100	*	Wow! I'm not American, so it is interesting that people outside the US know this, but not people inside the US.

t1_dt1e78a	-0.077200	*	Modern dictators have elections too, theyre just rigged. But yeah the U.S. is democracy.

t1_dskknlu	0.690800	*	CDU, CSU, and SPD just finished negotiating a coalition agreement, although it still needs to be voted on, it looks like Merkel is getting a 4th term.
t1_dsxvkup	0.440200	*	Only slightly better than what I thought. My opinion carries just as much weight as your science.  Source - am uninformed dope.  Edit - wasn't talking about the engineer!
t1_dskp1ex	0.000000	*	They were when they were Irish and Italian
t1_dtn6lf4	-0.294400	*	It's apparently fine to be completely misleading as long as you're technically right, at least here on reddit that's how it works a lot of the time.
t1_dtnrx4e	0.440400	*	Oh good. The payoff will be even sweeter. 
t1_dslz73c	-0.765000	*	No they weren't. Not a single republican voted for it. It's the conservative democrats were the ones who fucked it up

t1_dsgv1ay	-0.153100	*	that's fine as long as it pisses off the libruls is the response I hear
t1_dsf0amo	-0.910000	*	Of course not, which is such an independent tragedy that they think their impotent expressions of hate will do anything to bring a resolution to the conflict.
t1_dtlo60v	-0.493900	*	Anti Israel and anti semitism are not the same thing. But they are definitely related.   That being said still plenty of anti semitism on the left.

t1_dtd4q8b	0.000000	*	Which is why I have long advocated for compulsory voting.   In my mind, voting is more a Civic duty than a right.
t1_dtjtz3c	0.381800	*	That's a lie, if you gave them the option of citizenship they would accept it. Israel would never willingly give it to them because it would remove the Jewish identity from their state.
t1_dt6m8vz	-0.822400	*	People aren't angry at catholicism because the Pope condemned fake news, it's because the Pope isn't denouncing pedophilia and victim blaming.

t1_dsro08l	-0.489000	*	Taiwan doesn't deserve anything yet. If they want to escape China's shadow they will have to fight for it. They fought so they arent the PRC today, but they arent entitled to anything more
t1_dst2115	-0.057200	*	then you probably don't want to check out /r/PeopleFuckingDying 
t1_dsxl2nf	-0.913600	*	Okay, but the statement was:  >There's not much else you can do with guns besides hurt and kill people.   Not much wiggle room there and as a statement it is wildly incorrect.
t1_dttcpqy	-0.504000	*	Hey, its hard being an executive with only one yacht you know? Why wont anything think of my struggles?
t1_dsgwk78	0.177900	*	Well, not all of them. The rest is just misinformed and/or blindly supportive.

t1_dthjm06	0.593600	*	I don't know why you're taking a snarky tone. I hate Trump. The person I replied to (spoiler alert: not you) asked why people feel there's more anti-trump supporters than supporters. I answered.
t1_dshjekz	0.361200	*	Just like with the Bible, then.
t1_dsdl0ws	0.296000	*	Yeah, the Clinton Foundation.
t1_dshua76	-0.296000	*	Maybe if Indian sailors can stop leaving nuke sub hatches open. That would be a start anyway.

t1_dsnbr7p	-0.458800	*	I never once said it had been banned anywhere. But the Wikipedia link does accurately list places where it is considered a religion and places where it is not.
t1_dsl7g78	-0.139400	*	No, what we are saying is that that doesn't and shouldn't matter.  The US was founded and grown on people fleeing shitty situations and becoming the best they could in the new lands.  
t1_dsq9elm	-0.742500	*	That's really fucked up. In my state the identities of minors are kept secret and releasing that kind of info can lead to lawsuits if it's not already public
t1_dtki4x3	0.000000	*	You dont need it if your ubcut. The foreskin is a mechanical lubracant.

t1_dtx59de	-0.202300	*	Ehhhh tbh that makes it worse. Im sure there are more variables behind his reasoning (like a pharma bribe) than just 'omg my daughters will become trollops'.
t1_dslutit	0.440400	*	This. The mental gymnastics you need to pull off to consider yourself a good person and have this attitude at the same time, are of epic proportions. 
t1_dsjzk7l	-0.340000	*	You still have yet to deny that you are a troll btw.  Your silence is very telling.

t1_dsj6vds	-0.051600	*	Yep, I messed up my copy/paste. Corrected. 
t1_dt6aan5	0.555900	*	An average is not absolute. Most of China still lives in rural communities. Which isn't bad but you cant ignore externalities that helped raise China's standard of living.
t1_dsxs8px	-0.051600	*	I'm not. A civilian cruise ship with nuclear material sounds like a security disaster waiting to happen.

t1_dskn1ob	-0.125600	*	South African here, you are the most wrong about this topic, friend.  Noted that I'm a South African because I have a hint for Americans.  Ahem.  MAKE VOTING A FUCKING HOLIDAY, WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU

t1_dtwioza	0.421500	*	Im fine with a joint eu army and less American forces here too. Just saying America does it for their own interests. Theyre not in the habit of philanthropic militarism.

t1_dsony3w	0.318200	*	Maybe because you should put some effort in yourself instead of relying on others to do it for you when youre just going to say fake news anyway. Idk its probably definitely that

t1_dt8pque	-0.721200	*	that's the point. Arguing for the sake of arguing is not helpful unless you have a solution in mind.
t1_dtsbvu3	0.000000	*	https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=cfTJti0ojjs Here it is. You need to speak Russian to understand what he said.

t1_dtli5k6	0.401900	*	But you haven't read the article. You looked at the URL and decided the website is not up to your liking.   
t1_dskfxmg	0.000000	*	> Cornish morris dancers wear black, smack heavy wood staffs and shout.  So, basically indistinguishable from antifa.

t1_dt4n27t	0.493900	*	Yes, exactly, and that's not even considering the impaired driving test they're using and the legal limit allowed (which further contributes to the problem).
t1_dt900tt	-0.202300	*	I swear this reads like /r/niceguys for politics. Jesus it's sad.

t1_dtq4dba	0.401900	*	But the Californian government is constantly in debt. That's not an opinion. California is the most populas state, so of course it has the greatest GDP. 
t1_dt9l47s	0.372400	*	While your comment isn't wrong,  maybe my point is.  Who did you vote for?

t1_dto7j3r	0.544800	*	Except it's not a fact.   Russian bots influencing Brexit *is* a fact.   And liberals don't have a problem with Russia, they have a problem with corruption. 
t1_dsodkm2	0.340000	*	Different political system? I guess that's one way of a way of putting it. The ethnic cleansing is certainly a bit different from our system admittedly.
t1_dsltk1r	0.750600	*	Yes.  I happily voted for the competent human being.  Wished I had a better choice than competent but I'm a realist.

t1_dsskxny	0.401900	*	Its to show that from around the world, people aill support others regardless of race, erhnicity or nationality. Pura vida from Costa Rica.

t1_dsje1lc	-0.792000	*	> You are saying that it is impossible to be repulsed by gays without being gay yourself  No; he's not.  Nice straw man though.  Try again!
t1_dsm9je7	0.623700	*	Possibly, but just think - you're white, why not go to a black country? Statistically speaking you'd be the safest guy there, right? That's how your mind is working?
t1_dttwgoj	-0.361200	*	Interfering with their vote regarding Brexit. He's working for the Russians and they want to weaken the EU to become a superpower again.
t1_dt03up8	-0.226300	*	In U.S. history, probably not.  In my lifetime, which extends back to Nixon, definitely the worst.
t1_dsnfadd	0.153100	*	No true Scotsman.

t1_dskypmw	-0.771700	*	That's what happens when you promote fear, spite, and blind contrarianism as an ideology.  You end up with the Youtube comment section as president.

t1_dsv9nco	-0.474200	*	The best swimmer in the world can fail and drown due to any number of factors totally out of their control at any given time. There's no point where it isn't an unnecessary risk.
t1_dszxg8y	0.132600	*	I'm not seriously saying to lobotimize every Trump voter. You know that. I'm saying they aren't changing their minds due to information. 
t1_dtsp2xe	-0.077200	*	No it doesn't. Maybe in your head it does but generally getting around things usually means, you're abusing loopholes and gray areas as if you care about getting caught.
t1_dtp2rz7	-0.476700	*	Iran does both, so it does twice as much worse.

t1_dt9fkl6	0.505300	*	If you're innocent, you don't go firing the people who can clear your name.  It's legal, but sketchy.

t1_dsgywz6	0.000000	*	I think you mean entomologist.  An etymologist would be the person who could verify that for us.
t1_dtmt3ur	0.352700	*	You guys have to pay for vaccines?   You think not getting them is pragmatic?  Man America seems like a total wasteland.

t1_dsggqqc	0.885000	*	Because nobody is rich enough to end the game, though not for the lack of trying. If people were immortal, there would eventually be an end game winner.

t1_dskz59j	0.058000	*	Vote as if your lives are at stake is a pretty good message right now. And with this disaster of a human being as president a totally realistic one. 
t1_dssk8le	-0.007600	*	People really underestimate how important it is to solve local problems first. You can't possibly coordinate and tackle the huge issues without fixing the individual pieces.

t1_dt4xlyy	0.790600	*	Because the extra wealth can be transferred and used to support other industries and start new industries. From tech in Toronto to energy tech in Calgary.
t1_dtiv85a	-0.783200	*	Right? Then nobody would install metal bars on park benches so the poorest of the poor couldn't sleep on them anymore.

t1_dstqbi5	-0.726900	*	Not in the context you're trying to use it; it was definitely always a war for the North/South. The US labeled *their own* involvement in that war as a police action for some time though.

t1_dt6z51j	0.000000	*	Nope. Korea was under the rule of the empire of Japan. After the end of WW2 the Soviet Union and US divided Korea.

t1_dt2krjo	-0.340000	*	Rofl, you should try harder and make a coherent argument.  Saying random shit about exploitation isnt a response to people pointing out the issue with min wage.

t1_dtukx14	-0.778300	*	It seems to be fundamentally important to you that any discussion of sexual assault should be turned in to a discussion of false sexual assault claims. It seems that way for most of Reddit.

t1_dsyg3nz	-0.273200	*	> Get back to me when someone is convicted.  What're you talking about? Admitting your guilt and getting a plea deal is essentially being convicted.  So here, I am back.

t1_dtqyo3x	-0.540300	*	I'm not saying it's not valid. But I think letting the masses vote not for a representative, but on a complex issue they clearly know nothing about, definitely makes democracy look worse

t1_dtveeot	0.458800	*	Again I will point out that, how much does this guys money benefit the species as a whole
t1_dsurh49	0.000000	*	What do white people have to do with this? Is it just White kids & Haitians competing for these jobs? 
t1_dtr9pk1	0.669600	*	I love moms too! Especially my own, because even though she has a facebook she never uses it. Ever.
t1_dta0b6e	0.698300	*	So you want a team full of trump supporters to investigate Trump? Again your bias is clearly showing
t1_dskreip	0.881400	*	I mean, would you rather the police force didn't prepare for terrorism? Brits have been dealing with terrorism in London for a good century... it's not exactly anything new
t1_dt824pi	-0.153100	*	Because I consider hate speech a free speech. And I don't consider free speech a crime
t1_dt8w0hx	0.521000	*	Oh okay. That's still not what I'd want my tax system to look like but it's not as bad as I would have guessed based on the name alone. 
t1_dsjmf5j	-0.451500	*	When what?  Did Trump threaten him? Because he's on record saying Snowden should be executed. 
t1_dswy17n	0.102700	*	You don't believe in science. You understand and accept science. Belief never enters into it, there is no need for it when you're dealing with *reality.*
t1_dtuo805	0.202300	*	I was thinking the same thing... or that they should've been playing the Repo Man theme instead of Space Oddity.
t1_dtixls6	-0.532800	*	So simply arrest everyone unable to house themselves?  Who's going to pay to build new jails?
t1_dsm3x1j	0.670500	*	pretty close =/= 2 Republicans Senators have already confirm this  Which was the original statement I was calling inaccurate. 
t1_dtk56y2	0.303600	*	So we should just let them rot, and not allow them to come to a better place?
t1_dsoojv9	-0.826800	*	We have no idea what kind of debt he has to have those properties. He could be negative.
t1_dsvuujl	0.296000	*	Yeah for a second I though the spill was as big as France. 
t1_dsjsymp	-0.051600	*	Groceries stores in my neighborhood have excess food. Why dont we give it to placeholder continent used as a proxy for all economic stagnation and solve world hunger? Kthxbai
t1_dtdq6dc	-0.374400	*	The impression I've always had is that Labour are more prone to financial corruption and the Tories are more prone sex scandals and morality issues. Both sides do both however
t1_dsrqzas	-0.421500	*	I agree.. I am saying the code Turing broke was different and more complex
t1_dtuat4g	-0.723600	*	what exactly are you disputing? Dutch intelligence watched Russian hackers hack the dnc. Then wikileaks released the hacked information  What's your wacky conspiracy theory?
t1_dst54vx	-0.458800	*	I've never understood why being subservient to the chill makes you a coward.
t1_dtk89dw	0.000000	*	It should have been called *Unlucky* and it still would have worked as both words have three syllables.
t1_dtbi1bg	0.000000	*	The latency is because it's in geo orbit. Musks idea is LEO and would only have 100 ms of ping instead of 500 to 1000 ms
t1_dswy2la	0.000000	*	There are some industrial/consumer uses, but nowhere near enough to use it all. 
t1_dsm0ieh	0.612400	*	Yeah that one seems like audience-pandering by the author.  I doubt Obama set out to accomplish that.
t1_dsxopj3	-0.632200	*	There's no procedural mechanism, but if you're kicking them out chances are you're going to war with them so does it really matter?
t1_dshryq1	-0.632200	*	Well it shows that Russia has been doing something bad. But it doesnt conclude Russia is bad. This is not propaganda. 
t1_dtkf5r2	0.361200	*	Not to mention tons of biological things in mice happens like 10x faster (think lifespan, metabolism etc). That's one of the reasons that they use mice. Because they know the results faster.

t1_dtxbpzr	-0.743000	*	Lol what the fuck? US played a limited part in the Battle of Britain. Google it you simple fuck.
t1_dswtsy5	0.000000	*	That's an incredibly broad statement. It depends on the kind of immigrant and where they move to.
t1_dsk4bu8	-0.266800	*	Nope - remember, turnout was about 56%, and Trump didn't even win the plurality vote.  For any given person there's about a 75% chance they either voted against him or abstained.
t1_dtim7ba	0.844200	*	I'm sure the iraquis can easily identify the assholes executing them for daring to love someone of the same sex, or females daring to walk out unaccompanied or showing their faces.

t1_dsv70em	0.000000	*	You cannot construct additional pylons
t1_dsjue4u	-0.634400	*	I'm not really sure what you think you're arguing against. Are you supposing I am saying the Washington Post should not have run this headline?
t1_dte62v3	0.202300	*	You're only allowed to be elected president twice....but it doesn't say anything about later taking the office through succession.
t1_dt6cjnv	0.000000	*	[Here's something](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pNf4-d6fDoY).
t1_dtrjxpj	-0.113600	*	The only family he possibly cares about are his children, but I don't know for sure if he does even that.
t1_dta0q0t	-0.527900	*	Not all are of whom are afflicted are fully capable of fixing them, unfortunately. :/
t1_dtgyanr	-0.840200	*	Everyone already thinks Islamic Fundamentalists are bad, they are also a small minority of muslims, Britain first are fascists  that want the government to be openly racist.
t1_dsuu8gz	0.102700	*	Where are you getting that from? They wouldn't get paid less than minimum wage because they are legally working in the US.
t1_dsevpoi	0.893400	*	Thanks fren but perhaps you could create an investment fund instead to devote that money to new technologies that bring the cost of living down for every one not just tax contributing white males :)
t1_dtd3bga	0.345500	*	Like I said, what *we* think of the situation doesn't matter. 
t1_dswvwpr	0.238200	*	Still only 10% of their requirements. Better than nothing but they're going to have to ration water.
t1_dskp1fz	-0.551400	*	Does a majority of the US population live in those states? No? So the election could not be decided by those four states alone.
t1_dsh782i	-0.340000	*	thanks for the killer game of Crisco Twister.
t1_dtctlqm	0.296000	*	Vitamin Fortified Socks
t1_dtvvolu	-0.648600	*	a grave error, in retrospect.
t1_dsivah5	0.421500	*	> I'm pretty sure neglect from companies kills quite a few people a year.  Sure, now would you like to compare that to deaths caused by governments?
t1_dtcr04o	0.000000	*	Oh. I am really looking forward to that meme dying. 
t1_dt4lu22	0.361200	*	Thats courtesy of subsidized shipping from le government 
t1_dtfc31m	-0.250000	*	the idea that meat is meat is health is propaganda 
t1_dtkxbzq	0.571900	*	I'm pretty sure that all states have safe drinking water.  There are some municipalities where there are water issues (obviously Flint), but those are few and far between.
t1_dt19tmi	-0.153100	*	I think it would be very inaccurate to imply there's much difference between the views of Chinese media and the CCP. Chinese media is HEAVILY censored.
t1_dttkjpu	0.557400	*	i always laugh when people say the US is not a developed country.  we have a much bigger economy than all of your countries, bud
t1_dswchtd	0.812600	*	Haha. Both US parties are right-wing. They're a lot closer to each other than the parties in every other western country are.
t1_dslw28g	0.440400	*	She's not a Korean woman though. She has Korean heritage, she's American. Born and raised in America. Why would she be better suited to negotiate with North Korea?
t1_dslw28p	-0.636900	*	Month old account that posts in t-d? Sadly, doubtful. 
t1_dtc07im	0.153100	*	Ok, but I don't have those details so for now this story is not that realistic.

t1_dt0wah8	-0.153100	*	Yup. Evil startup, get in on the ground floor. That's how all successful tyranies begin.

t1_dsd6d1n	-0.952400	*	Mods can ban them and administrators can shadowban, but other than gross violations of Reddit rules I don't see it happening for negative karma.
t1_dsub12l	0.585900	*	Just, wow. Man
t1_dtpv9aw	0.340000	*	True, he was praised up until he died, then it became common to call him an asshole.
t1_dsdpfhd	0.000000	*	This wasn't just any Senate seat.  It was Obama's seat when he went on to be president.

t1_dsknvgo	-0.421500	*	That's the US government's dault. They enacted new bomb defence rules after the embassy bombing in 1998 and there place didntw meet the requirements.
t1_dsp1vmw	0.777700	*	they spend millions upon millions on these things and reddit thinks it can just cleverly say ha they are made of metal so a mere magnetic detector would just solve it!, its obviously not that simple
t1_dsnyx00	0.000000	*	Just pointing out there are extremists on both sides
t1_dtmdtfb	-0.718400	*	Probably a democrat policy.   They'd rather invite the terrorists than the ones fighting them.
t1_dtq6609	0.475300	*	Fucking hell... Looked it up, it's true. And it's hypothesized to be more harmful than ingestion due to bypassing first pass metabolism in the liver.   >Hooray for the humans!
t1_dsu9ixc	0.000000	*	> NHL and KHL players are not allowed to compete this year.  Why?
t1_dttcnaf	0.492700	*	Thats very funny.

t1_dthfj4m	0.077200	*	You said they want Trump out.  How are you going to get Trump out without impeachment?
t1_dtaxwn5	0.000000	*	Dubs
t1_dsr9c8v	0.851900	*	I'm pretty sure she said she's not running in 2020. At least that's what I found re-checking. If you mean a candidate like Hillary, I guess fair enough at least.

t1_dtncbhd	0.000000	*	My point was really more about Westchester.

t1_dtrxpi5	0.309400	*	Are you joking or??
t1_dsvezm3	0.362600	*	If I just liked the sound of my own voice Id post on TD where everyone agrees with me. Dissent is very strange isnt it?
t1_dtg3vid	0.000000	*	Is it essentially a poll?
t1_dtbx2zk	0.202300	*	Its funny on this site. People are so fast to point out Christians as the worst people ever and any criticism about muslims gets downvoted into oblivion. Its pretty interesting 
t1_dtbvvbt	-0.526700	*	Do you have an example of sanctions violations, or just talking points?
t1_dsscd8a	0.421500	*	Ah I see you are one of those only my kind of socialism is true socialism people.
t1_dtczki6	-0.420100	*	Also a very difficult situation with decades of history. Not something you can just chat over a cuppa about
t1_dsyx8nd	0.421500	*	Lol
t1_dt72ksu	0.704500	*	Like its so hard to just make an LLC and not even pay a corporate rate. Jesus Christ its so funny to see people on reddit spout off about things they know nothing about.
t1_dt76pxp	-0.296000	*	Its sad that even non trump supporters get downvoted for voicing their skepticism. 
t1_dtjkra2	0.205700	*	It wouldn't matter who the president was, they aren't going to stop because of some sanctions they don't recognize
t1_dt9jel7	-0.458800	*	A dumpster fire with the hobo still in it.. 
t1_dt99xl8	0.476700	*	But they have different evolutionary behaviours.  Intelligence is only part of it.
t1_dtxdzid	0.735100	*	This is true, but also depends what we really mean by black, which is pretty subjective.
t1_dso36nk	0.000000	*	Same here. And by this whole thing I'm assuming you mean the entirety of existence.
t1_dtqkxkf	0.000000	*	I think every router I've had in the last several years allows you to spoof the WAN port MAC.

t1_dsh31lm	-0.397700	*	Which is why I used the future tense in my comment instead of the past tense. I'm not entirely sure what the point of your comment is to be honest.

t1_dsmaii6	-0.826400	*	Oh, can they feel stressed or get a sense of panic? Its not as horrible as the pain as being boiled alive, but there has to be something negative about it right?

t1_dskryyo	-0.671200	*	Not everyone in the USA is a high school senior with almost no job experience and a stock broker.  We are a shit hole in many ways compared to just about every industrialized nation. 
t1_dsnpbj2	0.670500	*	That only works when they care about the truth
t1_dsyi1u2	0.286900	*	Same thing with breakfast. Big Mac or Quarter Pounder? Meh. Sausage or egg mcmuffin? Holy god I'm hungry right now
t1_dt17iu9	-0.969600	*	I honestly think that formalizing murder is not a good idea but whatever, the only thing that differenciates a murderer and the guy who kills convicts is that the last one is a legal murderer

t1_dsg7tv3	0.000000	*	It doesn't have to be tap water. If you're going to buy a bottle of Coke, you can buy a bottle of water instead.
t1_dtqq7oh	0.000000	*	Maybe list a few for me? I'll start off: 1. you can't vote

t1_dsuy7jw	0.440400	*	Explain to me your line of thinking then. Why do you think it is a good idea to have more immigrants in this country?  
t1_dt1hf18	0.526700	*	Please speak, with your votes as well.

t1_dsodt13	0.102700	*	Going on the record and claiming he brought NK to the table for Olympics is something Moon would take credit for. No one going to be as pedantic as you described

t1_dtbxehj	0.341200	*	That dude is a troll don't worry about it.
t1_dswmpmt	0.826800	*	It works out well enough here in Canada. We wave and cheer when a royal comes by, they don't bugger around with us, and as a result nobody really cares that we're kinda-sorta a monarchy. 
t1_dtgiwy2	0.000000	*	Trump has shown everyone the illusion of American democracy.

t1_dtf9nm4	0.714900	*	> clearly tongue-in-cheek comments  It could be that you just think comments are this when they aren't?   I mean, if it were tongue in cheek it aught to be funny, right? 
t1_dsivl2o	0.484000	*	Really? Most Americans hail him as a Hero, last time I checked. I've yet to meet anyone who disagrees with what Snowden did.
t1_dthk8sr	0.202300	*	They were definitely confusing you with Denmark a la the Troll episodes. 
t1_dstklya	0.361200	*	The entire Andromeda galaxy can fit in a picture. Your button is bigger?

t1_dta0b2n	0.420100	*	More like a thousand. The Guardian has it just over 1,000 for 2015 and 2016. Washington Post has a little less than that.
t1_dslxnnl	0.526700	*	it would be hard to top this group (Bush), in terms of absurdity   Oh, sweet summer child, if you only knew then...
t1_dsjc5kl	0.757900	*	Why can't they express their racism in a way that gets us better education, better healthcare, better infrastructure, better government?
t1_dtitrgn	-0.226300	*	Yes, your apparent inability to detect sarcasm is definitely other people's fault.
t1_dtkb049	0.557400	*	I have the white part covered. Now I have to eat more cheese and I'll be rich
t1_dtan9se	-0.865800	*	I can see why it might be annoying too but the offensive response to it (especially given that it's likely that person's second language) is frustrating.
t1_dt6138c	-0.038700	*	Possibly but I think most of the controversy should be focused on the fact the people withholding it think it's misleading as opposed to just releasing it and letting people decide for themselves.
t1_dsz2zlr	-0.226300	*	> It used to be 83% of Americans had health insurance before Obamacare  That number goes way lower when you factor in underinsured 
t1_dtrd3do	0.726900	*	Well, at least we can appreciate the meaningful (and less meaningful) conversations we have here.

t1_dtro9za	0.680800	*	I'm too old to give a shit about managing my friends in a database. That's for teenagers with plenty of free time. It's easier to just not post in public.
t1_dt6nhkt	0.401900	*	Seek help
t1_dsq5454	0.526700	*	Sure, you can do that.  You are not going to get under that 1 second reaction time.  I believe the article talks about that as well.

t1_dt6r7su	0.401900	*	I want to cut those as well. Read on, I wanted to eliminate welfare, medicaid, medicare, and social security.
t1_dsgjvrf	-0.341200	*	For the last time, Janeway is not a better captain than picard.
t1_dsfhjkd	0.612400	*	That's almost entirely because colleges tend to use bleachers rather than actual seats. You can fit more people in when you get rid of things like armrests and cupholders. 
t1_dt0xep3	-0.792900	*	This to me is the most logical argument for the death penalty.   In MY opinion however, the act of killing a human being outweighs this reasoning, but I can see why not everyone would think so.
t1_dsvpmsz	0.536200	*	What deregulation specifically? How do tax cuts help the U.S. catch up with societies with stronger economies, all of which have higher taxes?
t1_dtc0mup	0.418400	*	I know!  Letting the political elite make more laws curtailing our freedoms will fix it!

t1_dtpqowv	-0.493900	*	Ever notice how every guy named Angel is a cunt?
t1_dstl6cv	-0.493900	*	Yes. I meant the girl as in her parents/family or whoever told her/inspired her. That person or group is the perpetrator and should be held responsible for their racist actions. 
t1_dtq940s	0.790600	*	Where did you get the idea that any liberal supports Kim Jong Un? I'm pretty sure everyone is on the same page in regards to NK. Now if we could all get on the same page regarding our  in chief.
t1_dsj9gn2	0.585900	*	And let's see, the amazing USA has taken what 70 years to try and capture DB Cooper?

t1_dsmsbte	0.000000	*	I think you are correct.
t1_dsdp5su	0.000000	*	Full nodes have all wallet blockchains too so they would detect it. 
t1_dt50ndw	-0.493900	*	Are you an alcoholic too? That would account for the brain damage necessary to extrapolate your anecdotal evidence to millions of people around the country. 
t1_dt6mxgj	0.000000	*	He actually said quite the opposite. The church is open to civil unions he said
t1_dt24yag	-0.722000	*	The Sunshine Policy averted the Balkanization of East Asia that could potentially harm NE China and Japan. So, I see no problem with this.
t1_dta17ku	0.340000	*	i mean honesty can also get you in trouble if your honest opinion is line up all the blacks up a wall and just shoot them
t1_dt8z3ax	0.941200	*	We have the best dog, a very good boy. Everybody says how good a boy he is. Probably one of the best boys in the history of boys.

t1_dto4ann	-0.771700	*	If any one of the banks failed, corporations would not have made payroll. No one would have paychecks and no one could withdraw money from savings. 
t1_dtf25z2	-0.258400	*	Maybe if SJWs didn't keep giving those communities talking points, they wouldn't exist.
t1_dt2ev8w	0.232300	*	Your statements are incorrect in many ways. Your word choice is both aggressive and condescending.  I'll engage in debate if you would be willing to change your mind on this matter.
t1_dsr2mz4	0.273200	*	Even when we win we lose

t1_dtcy18o	-0.025800	*	Because clearing the rainforest and slitting the throats of stunned living cows to die from bleeding out isn't nearly as extreme as eating plants.  Middle is best. Middle is also 30-40%.

t1_dthehtt	-0.636000	*	Death to the Invisible Hippies!
t1_dsxzowo	0.177400	*	Your comment is a great example of how bad your bants game is.   I don't trust someone who's nation made Starbucks (which costs a lot more than Australian cafes) popular. 
t1_dt8d2rc	-0.875000	*	No one is going to die? Ive read several times people die of dehydration in places in the US.
t1_dttnuyc	-0.239200	*	And of course a 0 Hour work is the ideal work week for all the above.  Edit:  Apparently some people really don't like free money.   
t1_dtwweqt	-0.361200	*	Hackers that are mistaken for slackers by grandpa's FBI.  As an employer, I would require one thing from a hacker:  results. 
t1_dsg4hh8	0.318200	*	I don't think he was censured, he just apologized for the outburst, that was the last I heard about it.

t1_dsrag3h	0.557400	*	It is like you burn coal and then use that energy to run electric cars.
t1_dtio4o3	0.012300	*	Know what else Obama never did? He never conspired with a foreign power to become president. He's just not smart enough. Only a really, really smart and important person could do something like that.
t1_dt1cfce	-0.296000	*	Let me guess, you think social democracy is democratic socialism, huh? Social democracy is no more socialist than social media.  
t1_dtk043d	0.460600	*	Thank you, but how did the sale of rhino horns come to be? Did it start as the carving, and then to prevent it from becoming illegal, they said it helps with other things like cancer/fever?

t1_dsxbil1	0.493900	*	Haha yeah, theyre just like-  Wait what the fuck
t1_dsl6g4y	-0.361200	*	Awwww I'm sorry, does a history of lying about things that can easily be verified mean that people assume you're bullshitting instead of giving you the benefit of the doubt? That's just *so* unfair.

t1_dtnpsd3	-0.228000	*	Yeah because stopping some illegal mexicans from trying to live a life is more important than spies, money laundering and collusion. /s

t1_dt041da	0.812600	*	It's not we think everyone is like us. It's we *hope* everyone is like us. It's recognizing that if everyone acted virtuous, we'd practically live in an Utopia.

t1_dsr52t3	0.765000	*	Yeah trains are pretty hopeless over long haul distances. You guys could have had the world's best rail engineers   and  it still would have been a total shitshow.

t1_dtjm8jm	-0.476700	*	I'm saying they find him gross because they grew up where circumcised penises are the norm. He's normal, it's their perception that's skewed.

t1_dtdhfk7	-0.680800	*	I doubt that somewhat. Considering Ukraine is still using nuclear power and is intending to continue doing so. Also, Chernobyl nuclear plant was used until 2000, 14 years after the accident.

t1_dsvy52k	0.000000	*	The Pope is an immigrant, he wasnt born in Rome, the Vatican, or even Italy. Most people in the Vatican, werent born there, thus they would be immigrants to the Vatican.

t1_dsiavnp	-0.512200	*	Like it or not, the way your retarded political system works means he is in charge of the country. Don't like it? Fix it then so it doesn't happen again. 
t1_dsn2kcs	-0.705000	*	I disagree. R's and D's may both be corrupt and have policies you disagree with, but your argument is essentially equating Charles Manson with Justin Bieber because they're both humans.

t1_dsmy859	0.401900	*	Then how does Canada do it? As my other comment points out, Toronto is the most diverse city in the world, yet is the 4th most livable, and 8th safest on the planet.  
t1_dtn4u90	0.000000	*	I can buy 5.56 NATO at big5 sporting goods. What defines it as a military caliber? 5.56 isn't even a caliber measurement, its mm... .223 would be its caliber...

t1_dt4ga74	0.111600	*	If were talking literally? He's overweight, but whether you think he's a good president or not is completely objective. I just don't agree with the way he treats minorities in his country.

t1_dssa3fe	-0.433600	*	What is that anyway, have we really gotten that cynical?

t1_dsh0k5w	0.000000	*	That's what I'm saying though. Where I live at least the coffee is basically the same price as Starbucks or McDonald's or second cup if all you're getting us regular old coffee.
t1_dtv5e9t	0.342100	*	The EU is majority white but maybe you didn't know this?  Also I didn't know race had much part to play in economic security. Do you reckon this is why Africa is poor?

t1_dt6o6gg	0.185000	*	I feel the same way about shrooms, but it's a mindset that you can try to emulate without shrooms as well. I think besides that, you might calm down a bit when you get older

t1_dtw0ngz	0.177900	*	Or you could be like me, an exempt employee who works 80 hour weeks.   No difference in my paycheck between that and a 50 hour week.

t1_dslalx8	0.145100	*	It's definitely biased (and moreover has become way more opinionated than journalism is supposed to be).  But to say that it is only the left that is responsible is just not true.

t1_dtb54rs	0.758200	*	well. in germany it's not. it's common sense not to randomly insult anyone and especially not to insult police officers as nazis.
t1_dtk7er6	0.742400	*	TIL thanks! I'm not American so I've still got a lot of research to do. How many of them got past FDA approval?

t1_dtchv0b	-0.787800	*	I'm being serious. I completely agree that his stance is bullshit, but reducing it to gibberish is just childish. You apparently don't check your spelling before posting either. Stop fueling the fire.
t1_dsvofjn	-0.556300	*	> especially in Sweden right now.  This makes no sense. Sweden still has a very low intentional homicide rate.
t1_dswv4cm	-0.273200	*	Because those people have consciousness and memories? Not paper thin fingernails and eyelids lmfao. The only reason you should be anti abortion is if you're pro poverty

t1_dsrs2ro	-0.541400	*	Why else would the U.S. leave a garrison on the border if not to protect SK? It's not like we wanted their land.
t1_dt1cny6	0.000000	*	I would wager that is almost entirely due to skilled immigration and nothing to do with the adequacy of the US education system.
t1_dthpq7m	0.000000	*	Theyre brigading you because but the left is the only response they know.
t1_dtf1i73	0.687700	*	I'm sorry.  I was just joking about the bot thing.  I guess it's just not very funny.  Our governments and nationality don't define who we are as people.  I'm sure you're a great person!

t1_dtszaut	0.421500	*	Maybe it was me lol.

t1_dsx9dtv	-0.401900	*	Even assuming all of them are, you are ignoring the issue.  It isn't as simple as all abortions are permissible or none of them are.
t1_dsmez5c	-0.557400	*	The guy I was responding to brought up history by mentioning Hitler of all things possible, so I just found it apt to use the same dumbass logic.
t1_dt6czai	0.422600	*	Batteries are probably a better shape though, you can put them at the bottom of the boat right above the keel, space which is often difficult to fill, and you don't have to worry about ballast
t1_dsknqrh	-0.857500	*	That isn't true at all. You are making this up to justify your hatred. There is nothing positive or constructive in that.
t1_dtgrohu	-0.709600	*	Basically factory hunting.  If you consume factory raised meat, you contribute to similar horrors, you just want to ignore them.  These people are simply sociopathic versions of you.
t1_dt0vh6p	0.493900	*	Coup was not a real coup, it was a self-coup by Erdogan made to strengthen his political position. Also well-educated Turkish people live in great fear of the government.

t1_dsd7365	0.801800	*	> Some things are more important than self.  Right, but safety is not one of them. Not sure if Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs is still a thing but it would justify this.
t1_dtthc7f	0.000000	*	I'd rather that our country aspire to the standards of western Europe and the UK, than point out that at least we're not Bangladesh.
t1_dt91c9p	0.670500	*	Definitely, perhaps the biggest criteria that he hit out of the park that is specifically fascist is a huge focus on a mythical past - *Make America Great Again*. 
t1_dt856ga	-0.359700	*	So no. 
t1_dttg1l0	-0.102700	*	what article says that the Syrian chemical weapons Putin promised to Obama to be utilized (and that plant in Russia is the place to do it), most likely stayed in Syria.

t1_dtds030	0.000000	*	They may never even develop that way. They're looking as though they skip over that into decentralized solar and smaller scale stuff.
t1_dtgwije	-0.441700	*	I mean...ok. I don't really consider what they do hunting, it's more like pest control.  Hunting, for me at least, is when you kill an animal for food and maybe a trophy.

t1_dsjqpzv	0.000000	*	I think he's talking about the kid. 
t1_dtd47fv	0.298200	*	A perfect example of why what you said is not an argument. The existence of people denying climate change does not make them right. Argument from authority fallacy. Try again.

t1_dtwo5pw	-0.128000	*	...yes.  And it does this by removing them from office. Hence supporting the point that impeachment has to proceed first (a political move) before the criminal charge can be made.

t1_dse3zn0	0.440400	*	The Clinton Foundation's records are public and audit-able. So if you are implying that they're being paid from it, it should be easy for you to provide some evidence.

t1_dtriha3	-0.153100	*	Nazism is a form of fascism with bonus racism. Fascism is traditionally regarded as far-right.

t1_dszmosz	0.273200	*	Generally the military doesn't run with packs. They do Ruck marches, sometimes at a pretty quick Tempo, but fast walking / marching is a little bit different than running.

t1_dt896gk	-0.859100	*	Why are you arguing about killing of innocents? The whole point of this discussion is around what level of punishment should be applied, not what if the person was convicted falsely.   
t1_dt79y2t	-0.868900	*	There are similarities everywhere if you look hard enough. I agree with what youre saying, but to say America is just a big North Korea is the dumbest shit Ive ever heard. 
t1_dsvgmnp	0.051600	*	I dont know where these Jewish paid activist conspiracies are coming from, maybe since the Left uses George Soros dollars and paid protesters they assume everyone else must be as well?

t1_dv02p5m	0.575000	*	Yeah *because* the minimum wage went up = costing them more money. Boycotting them isn't going to do anything to help the employees lol.

t1_dtdkj25	0.114300	*	Iran can definitely try to kill them, but just like the Mossad does it, they must do it covertly. In either case, if the attack succeeds, it's technically illegal.  So in conclusion, yes, they are.

t1_dtigveu	-0.542300	*	There's no legislation that can pass that will make Independents strong enough in today's political climate. Hell, even campaign contributions is basically wide open.

t1_dsfb1rr	0.526700	*	Brave new world?
t1_dsn39vv	-0.599400	*	The original ad made no mention of race. People going on to say that because of someone's skin colour they cannot be called a monkey are racist.

t1_dswpv1f	-0.743000	*	I don't think pro abortion people want to murder babies either.    But when it's your future versus an unwanted child, people choose their own future.

t1_dtd10fa	0.000000	*	Obviously not.
t1_dta0u2z	0.246600	*	Yeah. But it's really annoying because it's so frequent. Like, I think everybody is aware that most Germans today were born post third Reich, they just wanna rustle some jimmies.
t1_dsq5etg	-0.318200	*	That's the tip of the iceberg. People can be terrible in general, let alone from the safety of a keyboard using an anonymous name.

t1_dt1hqq9	0.867900	*	Yes, that's what I'm saying, your freedom of expression is not true freedom of expression 
t1_dtizq0a	0.784500	*	No it works great in practice as well. Even in our economy you can see the closer we get to capitalism the better it is. And we were a lot closer in the past.

t1_dsk0ja8	-0.885000	*	Some. But not most. Some people criticise almost everything and get attacked for doing to. To equate some people with 'any criticism at all' is deliberate misinformation.
t1_dt8x05e	0.709600	*	Glad you had a good time
t1_dsio6gg	0.000000	*	Nope. I was talking about internal polling Farage has access to.   The polls that are released publicly are biased and nudging the electorate in certain directions.

t1_dt08jfy	-0.840200	*	I mean, it's not an idiom that is related by inherently racist nature, it's seemingly unrelated beyond that OP heard it used by someone they thought was racist

t1_dt6jlmn	0.844200	*	>The Liberal Party is just a socially liberal Tory party.   as a former Tory, that sounds perfect which is why I'm a card carrying liberal now.

t1_dtnjojb	0.361200	*	good point. USCIS itself got crippled as well, but ICE has been the opposite...that shows you the intentions of the administration

t1_dsiz73r	0.757900	*	I guess if the populace believes that it will become true. That's why I choose not to believe that despite our history. Those ideals live in me, and I hope one day you will find them again.

t1_dtk5vda	-0.233500	*	All destroying them does is reduce supply, without effecting demand. That will just increase how much they're sought after.

t1_dtk6ozx	-0.659700	*	Medically, mutilation literally means to cut off a part of the body.  Why would using the correct term to describe a procedure be an insult?
t1_dtoln5a	0.225900	*	Please make sure to contact your primary care physician, if you haven't already. The flu is particularly virulent this year, and people are often much more Ill than they think.

t1_dsv1mvb	-0.128000	*	there seems to be a lot of effort and energy being put into this, without much potential for a result.  If everyone knows Trump won't be impeached, why are they bothering?

t1_dtq7wr4	0.051600	*	Oh wow, I had never thought of it like that. Im from south Texas, and all I hear about are the war on the cartels. Its insanity. Thank you for your answer, it was very illuminating.

t1_dsmc7ar	0.571900	*	But it's a fiction celebrating resisting invasion by impure races, and those races were other whites. That's a lot of xenophobia baked in.

t1_dtego7g	-0.910000	*	Same with Asbestos, took them a very long time to stop denying the harmful effects. My entire work is based around people who now suffer lung cancer because of this stuff.

t1_dtosfqs	-0.359700	*	Well actually they lost more wars than they have won. Far more. Not to mention the retreat out of Vietnam and the embarrassment in the middle east.
t1_dtq2lfm	0.269100	*	Thank you for the sanity.    It's not some racist, anti gay conspiracy theory.   People need to stop thinking tv sensationalism and inject a little realism into their perspective.
t1_dsxlyxx	-0.442300	*	What aspects of pregnancy would make it a non ideal situation? Sure it's going to be tough for her, but what situations related to this would cause NZ to be worse off?
t1_dttpnbl	-0.476700	*	Here comes the reddit commies.   When you compare the wrongdoings of western governments to the wrongdoings of communist governments and see equal wrong, you're the one in need of a wake up call.

t1_dt61kmp	-0.778300	*	No. Morality and ethics are an inherent human trait. A lack of this indicates sociopathy, doesn't it?  You're implying atheists are unethical by nature

t1_dtarry6	0.000000	*	official story is BS. Don't think that Putin would do it that way. More the polonium guy, this imho is more mafia or something internal.
t1_dtgld4r	0.085900	*	Russia plays the extremes on both sides. I wouldn't be surprised if he is part of the left.
t1_dskf7rk	-0.250000	*	China actually has 56 ethnic groups. Chinese doesn't even refer to an ethnic group, only a nationality. The predominant ethnic group in China is Han.  Although I doubt an white supremacist knows that.
t1_dtonytj	-0.646100	*	I definitely disagree. The most overt racism I ever heard was in New York. Also, the most overt sexism. I didn't even know catcalling was a real thing until I visited NYC.
t1_dtsq0fl	0.000000	*	Also classic Russian whataboutism. When will they update their playbook with something less obvious?
t1_dskjbcg	0.636900	*	That's exactly what we are. People like ole Woody are new versions of royalty. The rest of us are peasants with smart phones, cars, and houses. Still peasants.
t1_dt6rjv2	-0.340000	*	What if someone tells you to shoot your dog? Telling people to do stuff doesn't mean they do it.  So if you're in that situation here's a tip: Don't.
t1_dtdml3t	0.295200	*	Actually, there has never been a time of more peace than now. Yeah, there are conflicts still around the world, but less and less every decade. 
t1_dsdy5r0	0.000000	*	Are you asking how I would feel if a bunch of Muslim immigrants were marching around with tiki torches and shouting anti-Semitic slogans? Because I would definitely have a problem with that, too.
t1_dsl8w4z	0.000000	*	It isn't. It's just not enforced.

t1_dtmp3fn	0.421500	*	Apple is made in China lol
t1_dtp0kec	-0.271600	*	A decent number of western nations have large groups pushing for the ban of cigarettes so it seems hardly like much of a deal breaker.

t1_dt8v8vv	0.361200	*	And it'll be even better once Brexit goes through and the NHS has another 350 million quid per week to play with.  We've all been fed lies.
t1_dtd2eqi	-0.844200	*	You misunderstand. I'm not saying Donald Trump is right or wrong. The question was why HE thinks the Climate Change deal was bad.

t1_dtvgq9d	0.464600	*	Isn't there pretty much zero actual proof of that claim actually being true? Like, don't the countries just claim that's the game plan and then never show any evidence of doing it?

t1_dtb1jmf	-0.849800	*	I saw that in my search... it may be the source of my confusion, but I'm not sure. It's always weird learning I have been wrong about a word for years.
t1_dsig02s	0.709600	*	Obviously both. however if you ever experience skid row... you would understand what I was getting at. At least the Mexicans can care for themselves while keeping clean sidewalks. 
t1_dsux16s	-0.202300	*	It's hard to deny race plays an ugly role in Republican messaging, but I agree that some people are too quick to bring up the accusation.
t1_dsnvpyr	-0.103000	*	The rules to the election were quite clear. Fortunately, Hillary did not run a great campaign, trying instead to rest her whole campaign on It's her turn.

t1_dt3ty10	-0.292400	*	Then talk about Liberia, why start talking about Africa? Africa is transitioning and stabilizing in general. West Africa is democratizing and are not accepting dictatorships anymore.

t1_dtdzaz1	0.810000	*	Well, there's people that have nuanced views, able to see both sides but still able to determine which one aligns with their view points best, and then there's r/enlightenedcentrism people. 
t1_dsgfym2	-0.820400	*	> French by spilled blood  No. They May apply for the naturalization. They aren't considered French. It's annoying to have so much fucking wrong information.

t1_dsyjz3j	-0.524200	*	Grocery stores throw out 10% of their products. Farmers throw out 20% of meat and dairy. 30% of caught fish end as waste!!
t1_dsocbm4	-0.361200	*	Guess you missed the fact that my comment was dripping with sarcasm. Lol  I was just replying to someone who said they had no say as to who the U.S. President is anyway.
t1_dtga4pf	0.318200	*	Your sources are Fox News and some guy on youtube, so I think that tells me all I need to know about your ability to evaluate a news outlet.

t1_dthetu9	0.000000	*	In July 2017, the House passed the sanctions with a vote of 419-3.  That is about as vast a majority can get.    edit: And the Senate passed it 98-2.
t1_dshuwmp	0.812600	*	They're cheesy as hell, but I have fond memories of them. Honestly, I think they were probably worth the money just to remind kids that we aren't actually the USA, and have history of our own. 
t1_dta2kmf	0.000000	*	I mean it's the same as just calling a policeman their name and not sir here

t1_dsux9rq	0.680800	*	Yep, white Haitians and black Norwegians are the hallmarks of both of those countries. Thank you for setting me straight.
t1_dtfyez0	0.726900	*	With that kind of certainty about things you cant possibly know yet, you would make a great cable news pundit!

t1_dsg6z51	-0.526700	*	Well, neither of your comments has been deleted by mods and I doubt either of you is banned yet.  Does that answer your question?
t1_dst8ani	0.012900	*	Never does $,xa5, or xa3. Neither one of these are backed by anything, they are all merely iou's from different countries, that will never be paid out but can be traded for something else
t1_dsuc17d	0.000000	*	Here comes r/ramen
t1_dttswsk	0.467800	*	Yeah and eventually it will heal itself. We aren't really hurting the planet, we are hurting ourselves by making toxic and dangerous to live in.
t1_dsoczom	0.120000	*	That's not true. In fact, Trump won every income bracket above 50k. Do those sound like the stupid people to you?
t1_dtogb5g	-0.476700	*	People are so used to your comment prefacing the descent into whataboutist bot land that they are conditioned to downvote people asking for the evidence. Sad tbh.

t1_dstt8cl	0.401900	*	*Global* security, maybe. Military solution to conflicts? I would invite you to take another look. The US is not the only one who uses the military to push regional or world politics.
t1_dsjj80a	-0.102700	*	Nah, too American.  I'm thinking Dutch news organizations hold Trump ambassador accountable... y'know. The burn is more subtle xa0in a lead by example kinda way.
t1_dskkw8x	0.318200	*	I am sure the system was not built properly to begin with. If it were 1918 instead of 2018, I an 50% of citizens couldn't vote at all.
t1_dsywydi	-0.060100	*	So you're saying it's a better system to just say:   Ah well, little timmy's parents are broke as fuck, so no surgery for him,   but grammy is loaded, so let's milk her for all she's worth.
t1_dthe96a	0.077200	*	No. Members of the house have access to it. The committee approved that, but not the public release. 
t1_dt1o20o	0.481000	*	How would this help?
t1_dsl3gpu	0.520400	*	do you think a party like that could see power again in modern germany? are frustrations regarding refugees reaching a tipping point, in your opinion?

t1_dtvcv65	0.000000	*	That's why it's only used in online discussions, I bet.
t1_dtfriq1	-0.493900	*	The context is that such a law would be consistent with what Brexit advocates want, and would make companies in the UK suffer more financially from Brexit. 
t1_dtsxnty	0.000000	*	Iran/Persia has spent a bit of the last 2000 years fractured and not a country.
t1_dsse2v6	-0.542300	*	There's also trillions sitting in tax havens doing fuck all.

t1_dsy46zr	0.000000	*	Maybe to add it to the tips that get split but not actually pocketed. (Source: worked at Tim's, the pockets are just a sewn on strip of material.)

t1_dsqczyq	0.000000	*	What's the common narrative in all of these links?
t1_dt8wr16	-0.945600	*	It very much is illegal in the UK. I agree that our police violence problem is very serious, probably has more to do with the the amount of gun violence we have over here.
t1_dsme4jw	-0.396400	*	You come across as hysterical and unhinged. Having a bare scrap of evidence for your beliefs isn't giving anyone else the benefit of the doubt, it's giving yourself a reality check.

t1_dtl09bx	-0.296000	*	You could have refused.
t1_dsl54n9	0.102700	*	Jackson was fairly good for *his* nation. He's consistently ranked fairly well for efficacy as President by scholarly groupings and surveys.  It was those pesky native nations that struggled.

t1_dt2yghk	0.000000	*	Its from a movie. 
t1_dsl03u5	-0.690800	*	Yes.  And so several  congress-critters telling the media that Trump said stupid racist thing, that meets that definition?

t1_dt5a2mq	0.750600	*	My comment has nothing to do with Trudeau. It has to do with the stable genius aka the best deal maker.
t1_dsl0z4u	-0.750600	*	Again. How to tell your position on this is bullshit.  Just imagine if Obama had said this. You would be losing your collective minds. 
t1_dtd31op	0.401900	*	Yes, one report in a newspaper negates all the other actual evidence. 
t1_dsr1ocm	-0.487800	*	It's not deceiving, you have the right to not tell your partner about your past experiences. In the case of abuse I can see it being much harder to say something.

t1_dsxe7xt	-0.812600	*	Saying that being against abortion is centred around repressing the rights of women is as unfair as saying that being in favour of legalizing abortion is centred around killing children.

t1_dtg1e89	0.150800	*	I see what you're saying about Clinton and I think that's true, but his presidency wasn't good for the people. Maybe for his corporate donors, yeah. 
t1_dte3qzq	0.440400	*	I'd say Jews need a better representative then. Maybe one that doesn't try to ethnically cleanse the indigenous inhabitants of the land it stole.
t1_dt0uw2d	-0.578800	*	That is not quite true because the US is no longer governed by the Articles of Confederation. If Canada wanted to become a state now they'd have to follow the same process of anyone else.
t1_dt0uw2a	-0.391900	*	Yeah but we are talking submarines here. Those are the guaranteed retaliatory strikes.

t1_dsom45e	-0.476700	*	Every comment of us vs them just makes things worse. We are not democrats or republicans, we are *Americans*, and we need to remember that.

t1_dty67np	0.391200	*	Completely true, but 140k people is a lot already. You don't get that many people out on a demonstration if nobody thinks there's an issue.

t1_dtifdb6	-0.700300	*	It's in a separate island country with limited resources, none of which we use, that we nearly went to nuclear war with. $80 million sounds cheap to me.
t1_dtwi9u9	0.000000	*	And who dominated the hre if not Austria?
t1_dsf2k3j	0.000000	*	Same can be said about Google which is an international company and is available and used globally.

t1_dt0kn9n	-0.154800	*	No no, it's not a competition, Saudi has nothing on the US. I think it's more like a little brother trying to prove to his all star older brother he can hack it too. 
t1_dtv9u75	-0.051600	*	It depends on the organization and their ethics.  Some are shady as fuck, some are widely regarded as ethical.
t1_dsvbihe	0.690800	*	True. However, if they *advertise* that they will honor those earmarks, they will get some pretty bad publicity.
t1_dswnvit	0.000000	*	Its a sex thing
t1_dswlcd9	0.000000	*	Source?
t1_dsk6fc6	-0.381800	*	Just because American culture renders us incapable of having reasonable social programs doesn't change the fact that we don't have reasonable social programs.
t1_dt3sdmg	0.000000	*	Or maybe, just maybe, we're trying to point out your hypocrisy. 
t1_dt8vzzt	0.480900	*	The problem with that is that today it fits your sensibilities, tomorrow the people doing the deciding may not. Saying mean shit, and wrongthink are protected for a reason.

t1_dsxgqny	0.332100	*	No, I think most people would agree that the Soviet Union were far from being 'white hats'. They were just baddies who luckily hated the other baddies enough to help put them down.
t1_dsju5e4	0.296000	*	Yeah the point of my comment was to show that striking out either and or was incorrect.
t1_dskheyk	0.000000	*	Why is calling a place a shithole un-American? Being crass and tactless is not un-American.

t1_dt0szmt	-0.108100	*	So. The difference isn't in how annoying agroup is. Communists are dogmatic and wrong, but aren't religious.

t1_dtvacqv	-0.762500	*	yes I did, but a country should not be ruled like that. Thats how nations were ruled in goddam colonial times, not year 2018

t1_dsznfwp	0.202300	*	But the operation is not against the people of Afrin. It is against the armed forces located and deployed there - which they admit to have a force between 7-12 thousand militias.
t1_dt0shj1	-0.743000	*	Carrying out a death sentence in the US is more expensive then keeping a prisoner for life fyi.  
t1_dt07wud	-0.734600	*	Maybe a big time, money maker was about to be released and some company was tired of dealing with this guy.   Fucking tragic.

t1_dsuu09v	-0.632200	*	Dude, where do you get your information from? Who is pushing for a $20/hr minimum wage other than hardcore communists? Whenever I hear the left online I know I'm about to hear some bullshit.
t1_dskaz05	-0.691500	*	> the Orb  Oh dear... wtf were they thinking? That is both creepy as fuck and if the people in the picture were more competent would confirm the Illuminati.
t1_dtlaxai	-0.077200	*	I hear that a lot, but I kind of feel like the birther nonsense was Donald telegraphing his intentions to run.

t1_dtliolm	0.536700	*	> these guys want to maximize the high, so they go well above the safe dosage.  Dude, you sound like a dare poster. This shit is just blatantly untrue.

t1_dsm77fo	-0.325200	*	To be fair, it doesn't really work like that. That's like telling someone they aren't African because they've never seen a lion.
t1_dstugcf	-0.612400	*	The NHL literally would have to pay money for players they have contacts with to leave the country for two weeks and get hurt. They would get nothing in return.
t1_dsl811x	-0.421500	*	you want butt salve with your crying towels?
t1_dsjbh4v	0.000000	*	Also maybe because they are a fucking city state? They literally only have to manage their one fucking city. Not the entire US.

t1_dsi5bw9	-0.680800	*	Maybe 110, or 120. They were phenomenal at what they set out to do.  Revolutionizing the music industry, at that time, was a hell of a way to get the world revitalized.
t1_dsmj5gf	0.000000	*	UK history is a bit longer than US history, though. We're not talking about events from 300 years ago.
t1_dtdbyqp	-0.224400	*	> False organization helps to let the pressure out and avoid short-term confrontation without having any real consequences for the established political mechanism  Like in the Matrix!

t1_dtjdoun	0.571900	*	What an intelligent reply. Your kind words have helped me find the error of my ways. 
t1_dsxsy4t	0.000000	*	Maybe because China is NOT communist?
t1_dt3h65a	0.612400	*	I think you overestimate the west's ability to assist. We don't have boundless excess housing, jobs, food, water, electricity etc. Our standard of living requires a lot to support. 
t1_dskwkmv	0.202300	*	Its the same around the world. Pakistan is just in the top 1%
t1_dsywwl0	-0.906200	*	Unfortunately you can fix stupid. He'll most likely continue to beleive this bullshit propaganda and most likely continue to spread it. 
t1_dskf8u1	0.353600	*	Incel isn't really a mental illness my dude, it's usually to do with education more than anything imo   
t1_dsoj3yn	0.000000	*	The whole pie can grow.  
t1_dtn8ye4	0.025800	*	Well, in this case they just had to meet in person. Because the American intelligence community 'tapping them would've been a disaster.

t1_dtrj4f2	0.624900	*	Working in the service industry is a great way for a university student to make some side cash.  When I was bartending it would be pretty disappointing to walk out with less than $100 cash each night.

t1_dtjiq0c	-0.340000	*	So has every other student who they're denying the bench by sleeping on it. 
t1_dt6zkk7	0.457400	*	Ah gotcha. Was fortunate enough to see one of the B2s flying when I visited Guam. Weird feeling swimming in the sea and seeing a giant bat-like plane flying in the sky...!
t1_dsgkhj1	-0.318200	*	Got to stereotype people who you think voted  for the other team anyway you can.
t1_dsr592j	0.421500	*	Gotten better...   Yeah because California is the worst state for pollution.   I love to hear them talk trash. We do this and that.   Yeah ok. Because they force you now. You dirty, slobby mofos
t1_dtiv4pg	0.509300	*	Haha   Go birds! U0001f985
t1_dt9x9uk	0.421500	*	Reading comprehension. That chart had literally nothing to do with them being called names lol.
t1_dsmtfpa	-0.510600	*	So you just conflated the womens march with the j20 riots?   Whatever it takes to get a failed point across.

t1_dt24vu7	0.493900	*	Worth a shot for sure. Don't see why they shouldn't just because the government/populace is backward enough to shun vaccines forever.
t1_dspb0no	-0.153100	*	The bomb was nerfed as well. They wanted to allow the pilots to get to a safe distance and the scientists on the project worried that 100mt bomb can create nuclear winter. 
t1_dtgab0u	0.000000	*	You mean I can't get my jack fruit year round!?!? I won't stand for this!
t1_dsrjhb0	-0.888000	*	Lately? TDSB is basically the largest criminal organization in the GTA. They have so many bad apples jailing these fucks would leave us without a school system.
t1_dsk00nm	-0.612400	*	I think that's a factor of our faulty terminology. There are some thing that can be fixed and some that cannot. But we all call them mental illness
t1_dt7z497	0.401900	*	Yes.
t1_dtgycqk	0.425300	*	Still wrong. Controlling for **mass** immigration isnt racist or xenophobic. Do you even know the definition of xenophobic? Hilarious

t1_dskoa3o	0.000000	*	The difference is Qing Dynasty isn't remotely the same as modern communist china. The Qing Dynasty allowed the Tibetan region to retain a degree of political autonomy under the Dalai Lamas.

t1_dsgu9y1	0.000000	*	Hit me up if you need a tester.

t1_dsn6xvi	0.000000	*	I dont think you need to say its on equal footing. But trying to understand the other side and correct rather than being divisive is the only way to get people to understand. 
t1_dsj0oy3	-0.128900	*	Yeah so is everyday life in the Netherlands, and they have a higher quality of life by almost every standard, and far less crime.  I'm American but I'd move there if I could

t1_dtbwddm	0.000000	*	Communism and socialism are two different things.   Most first world countries actually have many socialist elements.   Russia wasn't really socialist so much as dictatorial.
t1_dsm93cd	0.000000	*	Now I'm picturing dog cartoons where they have human heads.
t1_dtdmtwm	0.410100	*	cause that worked out so well for Iraq... oh wait.

t1_dsgwket	0.000000	*	It was a franchise level decision, not a company level decision, and one of the franchises in question is owned by the Horton family.

t1_dt0m60q	-0.051600	*	> there wasnt a single fully socialist country until now.  It's almost as if every socialist leader in history has been a liar, and none should ever be trusted again.
t1_dszuo1u	0.199900	*	easy there, you dont become billionaire by buying stuff you dont need like a 200 bucks camera.

t1_dt2sihe	-0.648600	*	And yet here you are fighting the culture war.  Considering that you can't afford a car, maybe sticking it to liberals should be secondary to your economic well being.
t1_dtq1ma9	0.000000	*	Are you a fetus?

t1_dttai1j	-0.732100	*	The NHS is paid for by the poor, dropping their income. Same as any other system they aren't actively using. That can drop them below the minimum amount they need to keep their home 
t1_dsma7fa	-0.493900	*	Would it matter if those goons just went back to Turkey with no plan to cooperate with any investigation or press charges?
t1_dt6razz	0.510600	*	Where do I advocate to rise the fines over 5bn? AFAIK that's intels profit, and the fines were for crimes committed over years.  You're exaggerating how impactful those fines actually are.

t1_dtwixtt	0.526700	*	Exactly. Our trade deficit actually shows the strength of our economy. Everyone in the world wants to sell stuff to Americans. That's a good thing.
t1_dsmuh1y	-0.599400	*	You're wrong and you're a racist.  Do you enjoy it when people throw arbitrary claims at you?

t1_dsrunvy	-0.226300	*	Is that why you need super battle hardened veterans to actually aim at enemies? World aint that black and white, get over it.

t1_dt35897	-0.886000	*	Nah look, I sarcastically implied something negative about Jewish people (that they are overprotected from criticism by accusations of being an anti-semite) and the downvotes are already rolling in.
t1_dtbl380	-0.951700	*	So I was right, your sole obsession is mad libruls and sore assholes, maybe it is time to come out of closet instead of  repressing it and hatefully voting for anti-gay hypocrites.

t1_dt8diri	0.421500	*	I don't see that anyone stating Trump won't be there long is subverting the President, in the same manner that truth is an absolute defense against slander.

t1_dt5uxxe	-0.627700	*	It's an argument, and in case you haven't noticed, it's not a very good one. Don't take it too personal - it's an internet forum.

t1_dt91mdg	-0.428400	*	In UK schools were not taught about it all, its not really seen as important. Only thing I was ever taught involving America was the Vietnam war, hearts and minds, the effect of the media etc.
t1_dtu1rij	0.812600	*	Free ambulance rides would be awesome to have. In more than one occasion I've taken myself to the hospital while bleeding everywhere because I didn't have a few thousand to spare for the luxury.

t1_dsm6pq5	0.051600	*	I don't get this logic. The whole point of punctuation is that it emulates speech. Unless he only ever talks in long, unbroken sentences, why would he need to think about it?

t1_dtvn2kf	0.000000	*	My guess, is that any of those cases would be from people vaping something they shouldn't have. Iirc, if you vape something that is oil based, you can get lipid pneumonia.

t1_dsj8v9u	-0.681500	*	You can see it very clearly on t_d. It's a horrible pool of racism, sexism and homophobia.
t1_dsna2xd	-0.195500	*	Firstly, we vote for parties, not candidates here. Secondly, his party didn't win the general election, so that proves one of your three claims wrong.
t1_dsyfdew	0.401900	*	That's why old phones shutdown randomly, you goofball. Because under load it can support that load you're talking about. It's a proven fact. Have you never put a voltmeter on a battery before?
t1_dtbrxso	0.318200	*	Plus, would Scottish (air)ports be ready to handle almost ALL exports? Because you couldn't send it through the rUK, it would have to go around our EEZ which would put strain on them.

t1_dt2kide	-0.571900	*	Poor comparison. Doctor is a Pakistani citizen. No one in gitmo is a US citizen. Gitmo is wrong but so is this.   This is some grade D whataboutism. 
t1_dtbmszh	0.525600	*	And you think the entire Russian troll agenda relies on one single shitpost comment that they didn't even upvote with bot accounts?   Even fucking /u/Unidan had a more effective bot army.

t1_dsnwav9	0.401900	*	They are hilarious
t1_dtdv7z0	0.318200	*	Unfortunately, there isn't really such a thing as less corrupt. Once a person is willing to make a small compromise on their integrity,  they may as well make a big one. 
t1_dsf04ff	-0.406900	*	I lean more towards the Palestinians in this conflict although who cares what I think. But your statement is wrong. Israelis can't even enter most Arab countries: eg UAE

t1_dsdpman	-0.226300	*	Maybe he's not and you are looking at this purely from a pro-palestinian viewpoint?  The answer lies not in the viewpoints, but the facts, and until you disprove them, you look uninformed.
t1_dtgxmgm	-0.458800	*	> you know what I am trying to say.  Massively violating human rights on the basis of I think we get dumber.   Tell me, during the middle ages, did only the intelligent people reproduce?

t1_dtmf6eh	-0.401900	*	When someone says Russia and North Korea are morally superior to America, that's when you stop talking to them. You're just wasting your time, it's a lost cause.
t1_dt5f7g7	-0.128000	*	Its a combo of both. A healthy economy can not function off consumption alone. And people with no jobs don't consume.
t1_dtvsvlh	-0.868900	*	Once again, killing for food =/= killing for funsies
t1_dt60b22	0.361200	*	Sounds like a back door rate increases when OP says A/C is a must and that is what puts people over.

t1_dtoz0su	0.742400	*	Yeah I know what it means. What Im getting at is its also a general all-purpose  exclamation, like Jesus Christ! Would be to a westerner. Sorry if I wasnt clear about that. 
t1_dtmy4a6	0.000000	*	The fact they felt the need to bolster that evidence with the dossier shows that that they felt that evidence was not enough to get them a warrant.  If there even was other evidence presented.
t1_dslzlbt	0.000000	*	Roll Tide
t1_dsxhfu5	0.000000	*	What else can you tell me about the future?

t1_dsnpwja	-0.852200	*	how convenient, you complain about Khan not condemning people, but are fine with trump not condemning his supporters terrorists acts...
t1_dsqhlme	0.401900	*	That's hilarious. How do people not report this stuff more widely?
t1_dssitmw	-0.218300	*	Stop...you can only make Isis so hard
t1_dsyiqql	0.226300	*	So your proof that the government of Canada would be treating two religious groups differently is that people are mean to Christians on reddit.  Okay.
t1_dtenqdd	-0.520400	*	So you're condemning Russian control of Russian media by linking an article by the BBC... which is controlled by the British government? Isn't that just a *little* bit hypocritical?
t1_dtpb2um	0.677700	*	Hello, this is the Army recruiting. We're very interested in looking for people who are self serving douches who think they can become heroes to enlist. Muscle and guns! Its cool! Disneyland of War!
t1_dson89w	0.401900	*	Yes. I know. I didn't suggest otherwise. 
t1_dsmix11	0.000000	*	If we can't make generalizations about things, reddit wouldn't exist 
t1_dtxkgeo	0.771700	*	Get back in your big tire truck and let the adults talk, okay, Hoss?  Just shut up about making America better while youre getting your Skoal and Big Gulp at the Pilot station... its better that way.
t1_dst9pro	0.502200	*	well no, but I was saying numbers can, just FYI

t1_dtnyyhz	-0.827100	*	Brexit was all about racism.  Which is why nobody did any of the research on how it would actually affect the economy.  Now Britain is up shit creek.  
t1_dtjc3a6	0.624900	*	>This is demonstrably untrue.  Please demonstrate it then.  Edit: Lol, downvoted for calling people out on their BS.
t1_dtfdlk2	0.000000	*	Corn, nor soybeans, are used to feed people.

t1_dtsapk7	0.000000	*	Its not if you add a middleman...
t1_dtmisut	0.000000	*	>they don't tech that in Chinese public school?  Only Chinese private schools tech that, public schools are too busy teaching spelling.

t1_dt7ebu4	-0.796400	*	Yeah, the problem is your spreading bullshit lies
t1_dspb1pc	-0.241100	*	That's the thing with nukes, people don't get that they aren't just cool explosions for a sec. They aren't just big bombs.

t1_dsk9z36	0.000000	*	He is two steps ahead of the Chinese and the Russians, what a fucking legend
t1_dsma2tn	-0.476700	*	He's given up on Donald Trump and assumed his pure, enraged form. Set free upon our world, the destruction he brings is unlike anything ever seen before.
t1_dta1vfk	0.510600	*	Afghanistan and Waziristan are fiercely tribal.  I don't think one would be hard pressed to find someone there who was happy that an opposing tribe got droned.
t1_dtvlbto	0.000000	*	Are you a vegan?
t1_dthl9yt	0.517500	*	Right there with you man! Love my 300 blackout AR. I am the weirdest liberal you will ever meet lol. I use to be republican/ind but now all the right says I am a libtard so I embraced it.

t1_dtm2436	-0.596500	*	Wow that is fucking sad as shit. Marvel has had a couple of feels trains in their least movie(s), but damn.
t1_dtcocxi	0.142300	*	Vegans, like any group of people, are multifaceted. Personally, I don't think the reasons are not so much overlooked, but don't want to be seen.
t1_dt3z799	-0.359500	*	You underestimate its power!
t1_dthegsr	0.000000	*	Chlorine is nowhere near as deadly as sarin.
t1_dsj7vtu	0.226300	*	True, but they represent 100% of you. They are who people see and therefore base their opinions off of. Similarly, Trudeau might have only had 1/3 of the votes, but he still represents  all Canadians.
t1_dth3u4q	0.000000	*	2018.
t1_dsrktgm	0.000000	*	It even has rhyme.
t1_dso4l2i	0.089600	*	Thank you, I was totally not making a joke and didn't know this piece of information.
t1_dt8te32	0.510600	*	46% of people who voted elected him. That's 26% of eligible voters.  Just for fun, I figured out that is roughly 19% of the total US population that voted for trump.
t1_dt8wcmu	0.765000	*	America was founded on great deals just like this. 
t1_dta2jve	-0.025800	*	I dont believe that and for the slim chance that you are telling the truth, youd still be making a stupid statement by projecting your very unique perception onto the majority.
t1_dtuqnp9	-0.401900	*	so you're saying as soon as somebody is succesful in life they all need to focus on 1 or 2 problems in the world.
t1_dsx15px	0.510600	*	But it is a government function to determine who gets funding and if the elected official determine that anti-choice beliefs dont deserve free money, thats their right
t1_dskdaq4	0.624900	*	I think you're taking this joke a bit too seriously.  We're making fun of Sweden, that's all.
t1_dspt8p1	-0.250000	*	In many countries the political spectrum consists of varying flavors of right wing ideologies (radical nationalism vs neoliberal zealotry). The US is one of those and arguably the prototype.
t1_dslwk9v	-0.817600	*	The whole pineapple on pizza argument is going to be the true cause of our second Civil War.  Civil War 2: You Wanna Pizza This?
t1_dtnhaox	0.401900	*	That comparison really doesn't make sense. Iran pre-revolution was a single-party dictatorship which is then overthrown; where is the party embracing further extremism?
t1_dskru2d	0.318200	*	Im sure that cross you bear is very heavy
t1_dsmh37s	0.000000	*	!reddittroll #dontfeedthetroll
t1_dssym5j	0.709600	*	Yes, we are in agreement.
t1_dtv7dly	-0.542300	*	Wait times are the only argument I ever see. You realize this refers to non emergency surgery wait times right? Its not as if you wait for emergency care, or to see a GP. 
t1_dsz9re4	-0.340000	*	Thats fine. But you have the choice. Its much better than that choice being made for you. And either way, it illustrates what I was saying: that equating dying young and dying old in debt is idiotic. 
t1_dt32c6r	-0.296000	*	Except for the video of him showing off his boner to women on a plane even after they were saying stop
t1_dtomlii	-0.599400	*	I say we replace torture with Powerpoint
t1_dtoith2	-0.781000	*	Well one is completely disgusting, and the other is disgusting but understandable. Muslims are shitting up Europe.
t1_dtctwjy	-0.095100	*	Just to let you know, democracy and republics aren't mutually exclusive. A country can be both, for example, the USA. 
t1_dtgdi78	0.000000	*	Congress did all they can. 
t1_dsstam0	0.296000	*	Yep. It's a decent amount for those who live outside of two capitals. 
t1_dtuc0zw	-0.557400	*	No.    That's why SOP is to fire two.
t1_dssgv2i	0.076200	*	You have to acknowledge the fact US invaded their country... it cant be that hard to twist the facts.
t1_dshrwmp	0.000000	*	You are correct, I dont decide on how its discussed! Though for the sake of civil discussion, lets try to stay on topic!
t1_dtgodl8	0.449700	*	No, but it should be noted that there are former Communist Party Members and KGB (like Putin) still in government or positions or power. 
t1_dtowlju	-0.557400	*	Imagine being in a nursing home, telling this story, and having everyone think you're senile and full of shit.
t1_dtfwx1u	-0.631900	*	Exactly, and no, it won't help with anything. But I do think it's better to protest racists than let the World think you're okay with it.
t1_dta3gtk	0.296000	*	Yeah, squatting leaves a straighter path for your poo to fall out. 
t1_dtveeti	-0.747800	*	Is the hunter running around killing children? It's not a fair comparison at all.
t1_dsyoe1s	0.000000	*	Businesses most often have white vans because that's the cheapest option.
t1_dtd1uf9	-0.440400	*	Chinese hoax confirmed. If global warming was real, the bears would be on fire.
t1_dsq3qv6	0.000000	*	In the 21st Century they are.
t1_dt3yu6z	0.757900	*	That is so moving. Sweden is such a peaceful heaven.
t1_dsq4jdp	0.458800	*	well, how do you honestly feel about it turning out to be a hoax?
t1_dt2375q	0.318200	*	Who is that doctor please?
t1_dswrs2b	0.128000	*	Clearly you have no idea how progressive Canada is. 
t1_dspr7jz	0.000000	*	Which it isn't.
t1_dsje97w	0.000000	*	That's explicitly the distinction I was making.
t1_dtr9g49	0.000000	*	I joined in 2005 and seem to remember the .edu requirement disappearing around late 2007 or so. 
t1_dttpwcs	0.520400	*	Yes? It's a teensy bit different with it mostly being spelling that's different.  I'm curious though what made you think the UK spoke a different language unless you're being sarcastic?
t1_dso59az	-0.440400	*	BLOODY PEASANT
t1_dta0rv0	-0.361200	*	you're criticizing Germany by comparing it to America when it is Germany that America should be learning from.
t1_dsiovrs	0.000000	*	Sure...but the kid was left at her aunts.
t1_dt7qpgd	-0.077200	*	You cant reason with these people, friend.  They dont see farmyard animals as animals anymore, but god forbid someone eats a dog
t1_dt8gwpk	-0.076100	*	Then why did you make your original comment in the first place? It implies you believe that this result of more women isn't merit based at all.
t1_dso24s6	0.340000	*	Ha, what makes you think that? 
t1_dte796l	0.721300	*	What, like voting for Hillary? LOL
t1_dt6d5ff	-0.273200	*	Gas is low carbon.  Also, they could in many cases offset their Tesla with a solar panel. It takes roughly 10 square metres per car (depending a bit on where you live).
t1_dswvz67	-0.768800	*	Bullshit. No physician in Canada can terminate a pregnancy over 24 weeks without serious indications that the life of the mother is at risk or that the fetus has very serious malformations.
t1_dtnu8eq	0.000000	*	You guys can have him back too.
t1_dtnh0dp	0.000000	*	So ICE got colder?

t1_dtca0cn	0.571900	*	My pleasure Mr. President
t1_dtbbec9	0.897900	*	I had a coworker once from Africa.  Nice man, he had a beautiful voice, sounds like Morgan Freeman.
t1_dsqfv00	-0.793500	*	Tell that to people whose lives have been ruined due to false accusations. They may not be on an equal playing field but both are bad an preventable to a degree 
t1_dsjwuft	-0.476700	*	Hell yes, easily so. I mean, what do you want to compare us on? Because, seriously, the only legitimate complaint one could have about this city right now is the housing prices.
t1_dtdejcy	0.421500	*	Nice ninja editing kid 
t1_dt2k6kv	0.421500	*	ps: lol u wild wyd tho?
t1_dsjygbq	-0.051600	*	But... they don't *need* it to get better, so in reality it just means things get worse for others. 
t1_dtsull3	-0.141900	*	You may not like it, but thats the reality of our world. Land belongs to whoever has the power to control it.
t1_dt614ba	-0.557400	*	Brainfucking is some next level shit, I've never even heard of that, ew
t1_dt32u2s	-0.599400	*	Twitter world war 3

t1_dtcx2t1	0.000000	*	Fucking Slavs
t1_dsekxsn	0.743000	*	> false idol who tries to trick you Christians into worshiping him   This sounds far much like Obama than Trump honestly .
t1_dt3o3p1	0.000000	*	what does that have to do with anything?
t1_dt974wl	0.279600	*	Why do you say I need help? You're coming off rudely and condescending. I didn't say anything insulting. 
t1_dskeptx	0.000000	*	I think he meant the woody Johnson 
t1_dt6dxw1	0.000000	*	You are right. Its new that the presidents primary (insert Jareds official government title / job description when finalized) activly partaking in it.
t1_dt3m4n3	0.636900	*	Its actually like 200-300 cc of air to cause an air lock in the heart. Thats a ton.  Found [this](http://anesthesiology.pubs.asahq.org/article.aspx?articleid=2026502) if anyones interested.
t1_dsdq5ac	0.556300	*	Do you really trust Steve Bannon, of all people, at his word?  
t1_dsfpiv4	0.624900	*	Sure. So what did that accomplish now? Bill isn't sitting in the White House.
t1_dslzq2q	0.419900	*	Health codes? Sounds like nanny state regulations to me!
t1_dtq1o1g	0.440400	*	Thanks
t1_dsybemu	0.000000	*	The vast majority of the world's countries are ethno-states.
t1_dt9m99b	0.765000	*	What about the fact that you're willing to trust this anonymous source, while you're not willing to trust the one about the birth certificates?
t1_dto1tf4	0.612400	*	Yes, please inform me about the evidence that Trump colluded with Russia. [Well...](https://c.sceneclip.com/data/clip/1sDcLRx/clip3.small.gif)
t1_dt9z1c9	-0.510600	*	I'm certain some conservative fuckstick would absolutely believe this. And that's fucked up.
t1_dtavo0q	0.000000	*	Oh hai Mark
t1_dslhscn	-0.842200	*	I know you're trying to be clever, but Europe did know it could descend into madness, and at least Otto von Bismark was quite aware that it would be 'some damn foolish thing in the Balkans'.
t1_dtuhp63	-0.169500	*	Hey, with high funding I wouldn't be surprised if Mars and The Moon had their own production companies
t1_dsn5016	-0.102700	*	That last paragraph is what makes the difference though. Infrastructure investments pay off over a long period of time.
t1_dtn6bqj	-0.179600	*	Personally, I think doubt in our institutions is much more important to address than would be methods, contacts, or possible info that could be exposed.
t1_dtwkou3	0.624900	*	That would make a great sitcom. 
t1_dsi53x2	0.440400	*	It's funny, in the youtube comments:  Imagine if Bush did this..   
t1_dslwck3	0.000000	*	Are we not supposed to say African American anymore? 
t1_dsv0x23	0.689400	*	Won't work well in elections lol did you see his whole campaign? His base loves these moves and they account for a lot of voters 
t1_dsz8ae5	-0.796400	*	Almost as if this country is run by heartless cunts with too much money who's only motive is keeping/getting more money. 
t1_dssqaj0	0.599400	*	No virtue signaling here. Nice attempt to debase my position, though.  Monitor and become legal guardian of are wildly different things.
t1_dsldc4v	0.000000	*	Our summers are almost indistinguishable from our winters. Never too hot and never too cold.
t1_dtu06wm	0.440400	*	We should be supporting Israel.
t1_dsdpvvy	0.624900	*	Bernie would have been great. I meant after the primary. He was my first choice. 
t1_dt9uhqq	0.680800	*	I'm sure some enterprising person will charge 10% to technically own the property.
t1_dtwuigc	0.599400	*	I think the real solution here is assasination... Not that the CIA is capable of it(Castro...).
t1_dskh03f	0.000000	*	WW3 is probably not happening, Austria is chill nowadays.

t1_dtsktfe	0.361200	*	Like who?
t1_dtdtdx8	-0.844200	*	They're just dumb, ignorant, or in denial. That's it. Or maybe just full of hate. 
t1_dthajo8	0.401900	*	> they come in build what they need and then do nothing for the people already there.  They build roads yes. And railways. Who needs those?
t1_dslwtjp	0.340000	*	I think the dems just got cocky and went with the safe pick.
t1_dthvysb	0.000000	*	Huh? Papadapolous was employed by Obama? When?
t1_dt8ni9v	0.493900	*	Oh put down your pitchfork and just let those guys enjoy it
t1_dtbwie3	-0.318200	*	Also with how long Afganistan has been in conflict, bomb-makers are now quite experienced.
t1_dtiw11b	0.526700	*	Winning? He doesnt need Russia for that. 
t1_dtuandx	0.449700	*	> Maybe he loves the west and wants them to not end up like Chicago.  NATO causes that??
t1_dti3373	-0.476700	*	But the outdated OS still has vulnerabilities related to racism and nationalism, which are easily exploitable. Security updates are no longer provided. 
t1_dtd42sb	0.077200	*	>To argue that the Christian-Democrats would gain from the refugee crisis in terms of migrant voters is the most absurd thing I've heard today.  Which I didnt say, but okay.

t1_dtvctmn	-0.077200	*	Meh. 
t1_dttglcq	-0.440400	*	Its like raaaaaiiiin and then you get cancer
t1_dtp1zma	0.802000	*	Thanks for pointing that out. I'd honestly lost track of my original reasoning regarding the report and your comment got me to take a second look. I've amended my original comment.
t1_dttbsh4	-0.722700	*	Avoiding mob rule by having the minority rule is like avoiding trimming your fingernails by cutting off your hands. You technically got what you wanted, but your overall situation is terrible.
t1_dsfkteu	0.318200	*	Calm down there Putin.
t1_dtyur1i	0.717800	*	This comment is extremely helpful in pairing a picture. Thanks for taking the time

t1_dtgictq	-0.359700	*	You used logic, there is absolutely no way they are responding to you 
t1_dthcw43	-0.636900	*	They said the girls pissed on the bed that Obama and Michelle slept on.
t1_dsvt8b4	0.659700	*	Traveling would help a lot imho.  If more people traveled and really got to know people around the world, their systems, their culture, not just museums or beaches, it would help a lot.
t1_dtvjpnk	0.741500	*	Not really, the agreement doesn't cite failure as a condition of withdrawal.  
t1_dtv4aij	0.000000	*	Thus is also how the pink line by Victoria's secret is made. Slaves making panties.

t1_dstl2h5	-0.275500	*	Only if you don't count things like thanksgiving break, winter break, spring break, and summer break. You guys get more vacation time than most people in that regard
t1_dsz7l8r	0.318200	*	Yes, but .... There is one part of society across all the regions that labels as Nazis anyone who tells them something they dont want to hear.
t1_dtt7zsh	-0.765000	*	If there's no problem - there's no problem. Progressiveness isn't measured in the number of appeased minorities.
t1_dswykbs	0.440400	*	He's not calling one armed a slur, he's saying that the commenter did indeed identify two protected classes. The disabled in this case.
t1_dt2ktq8	-0.345900	*	like it or not, we have a pretty huge influence on what happens around the world.  Although that may change if Dumbass gets re-elected
t1_dsdqkww	-0.526700	*	Please get back to me when one of the official main goals of the Israeli government is to murder all Muslims.

t1_dt82z7i	-0.817600	*	The troop presence there is only to justify attacking the North when ours are killed. They told us we were a speed bump and justification for retaliation.

t1_dtipjf9	-0.226300	*	That 9mm isnt used for the assault part though. Its a tracer thats used as a spotting round to better range in the rocket that generally comes soon after.
t1_dtubikc	0.000000	*	Tell that to me 10 years ago. 
t1_dtjnjhb	-0.051600	*	I can dig it. But take a look through the thread, there are people saying the same thing in all seriousness

t1_dt1nm9k	-0.812600	*	All that shit is what you call bullshit.  And he never faced off against Trump, just Hillary, who owned the DNC at the time.

t1_dtvetyp	0.075400	*	More importantly is idea framing. By using the word healthy instead of unhealthy it frames it as a positive instead of a negative. Cognitive tricks and all that.
t1_dtnk5va	0.000000	*	sorry missed the fart in the wind context. I agree, article is completely simplified and absurd. But that's r/worldnews for you since 2016.
t1_dtiydd8	-0.808900	*	Trump doesn't care about any of his family enough to be intimidated with threats against their lives.
t1_dtlkt5d	-0.710900	*	Sorta. The prisoner's dilemma is more about uncertainty than about morality; depending on the crime, cooperating might be morally superior, or defecting might.
t1_dt31t4v	-0.344200	*	I'm not arguing against a minimum wage. I'm just saying it would have no impact on this particular problem.
t1_dtxqiva	0.000000	*	You literally did just that.  Where is your source that a lot of prisons in America are private? 
t1_dt30gnz	-0.504000	*	So you proved he was wiretapped? I never said illegally wiretapped and you said the two republicans said he DIDNT use the word shithole just harsh language.  So I was right on both claims?
t1_dsmfr3s	0.000000	*	FeelsBadMan
t1_dsxf332	0.743000	*	You're right, this whole situation is summed up as corporations complaining that they are making huge profits rather than extreme profits.

t1_dthc54d	-0.407600	*	> Though saying Trump is going to nuke North Korea is only slightly less dumb.  Why 
t1_dts5fc9	-0.875600	*	I'd rather be charged for almost any crime in the UK than in the U.S. given how harsh American sentences and penalties are for most crimes, and how lacking the U.S. prison system is.

t1_dt0r1mm	-0.848200	*	Sentencing someone to death isn't free though. In the US for example, the trial alone can cost tax payers millions.
t1_dt7r1o4	0.493900	*	In Colombia we dont even have a history class at school. We pretty much are taught basic math, spelling and grammar.

t1_dsqie56	-0.660300	*	No we won't, nobody is going to shut off the internet in the US because of religious or political views. I don't like Ajit Pai as much as the next person but this over reaction is ridiculous. 
t1_dt7e77b	-0.226300	*	If you had any concept of history, that would have meant something to you.  My bad.  Please look into the incredible number of times that reunification has been requested in the past decades.

t1_dtiw5sl	0.223500	*	Lots of homeless won't use them for exactly that reason. They don't allow weapons or drugs. They aren't willing to leave those behind, so they sleep on the street instead. 
t1_dsimp6b	-0.296000	*	No, that's not what I was saying. Don't put words in my mouth.
t1_dsq624l	0.542300	*	Well we certainly do not refer to Indians as Asian in Canada . That's Britain. 
t1_dsstgrs	0.709600	*	Was Sword in the Stone dark?  Been a while. All Dogs was definitely pretty dark.

t1_dtdd4du	-0.733200	*	Meanwhile Israel has their own cutting edge nuclear weapons with ICBM + MIRV. How is assassinating Iranian civilian scientists not for political gain in this case? 
t1_dtvipbz	-0.636900	*	Not too much logic in that argument. Complexities and variables of a nation's economic problems > going to the store. 
t1_dshvzz9	0.827100	*	still 2.5mm seems like such an arbitrary number, such a minute distance. But I'm sure they have the ability to make sure where the satellite is to exact millimeter ?
t1_dsrzg2k	0.000000	*	He hasn't gone the way of Gaddafi because nobody wanted to get bogged down in Korea 2.0.  The nuke card just puts a giant target on his back.
t1_dszf1bf	0.318200	*	I'm curious.  Do you have any credible sources on that?
t1_dsuth09	-0.226300	*	Yup. I know at UPS they have to throw a fuck ton of benefits at their employees to keep them around, because they *work* you there. I've heard the term golden handcuffs used to describe it

t1_dtntgip	0.000000	*	In my experience that would actually make you more likely to be Russian. 
t1_dtgcfqr	-0.680800	*	So you say i'm wrong, give no reasoning, say that i'm wrong again, and then resort to ad hominem     fucking A+ effort right there. nice discussion.
t1_dshl7y0	0.000000	*	Soros funded is a meme often repeated by many people used on the right. Its not necessarily a dog whistle for jewish

t1_dsk7q6a	0.767400	*	I didn't argue he knew what was getting into, what I was implying was that the guy wasn't actually unwilling. It was a skit, played up for laughs.
t1_dtbs87c	0.510600	*	It's not simple to change the people in charges mind though. You act like it's easy.

t1_dt8t6ea	-0.202300	*	He's basically ruling a feudal absolute kingdom. The king does what he can to keep the nobles in check.
t1_dsezsas	-0.571900	*	Calling Clinton's actions 'assault' is tricky. Throwing Monica under the bus - which was basically what happened - was wrong. 
t1_dsghvi7	-0.772200	*	alt accounts don't count bud, LOL  Reminder you guys can barely scrounge together 1000 signatures for your stickied petitions.  LOW ENERGY.  SAD

t1_dt4s45n	-0.340000	*	Or other factors cause school shootings and the blame game on the media was misguided from the start.

t1_dsla6hs	0.458800	*	Nonono, you don't understand. You smack them with the stone. :)
t1_dtq942u	-0.261700	*	The impression I get is that the Poles were as racist towards the Jews as the Southern whites were towards blacks in the Jim Crow era, but only the Nazis perpetrated the Holocaust.
t1_dt379ym	0.361200	*	Just like the Jews stayed in Russia and Arab countries and fixed it themselves?
t1_dskyi47	0.421500	*	That isn't what he said at all. He said the GOP has been pushing their base further and further to the right. That's objectively true, at this point.

t1_dt5aveu	0.177900	*	IP being the future is an opinion, and one that is heavily debated currently. There are many solid arguments for why IPs are hindering societal progress

t1_dtxkzhd	-0.718400	*	I have to disagree. I still believe kids would smoke if vaping wasn't an option. Smoking was every bit as disgusting 20 years ago as it is today. Yet 20 years ago we all smoked anyway.
t1_dteco54	0.575900	*	Youre telling people in BRITAIN to not bother protesting his visit, and instead change the electoral system? The American electoral system?

t1_dsh62mh	0.761500	*	Everyone loves Rush. There isn't anything bad to say about them.
t1_dtwjbfn	0.526700	*	If its just geographic then why do they make claims to Alexander the Great and have constitutional claims to the actual territory of Macedonia in Greece? Seems like an argument in bad faith
t1_dtg1erl	0.836000	*	To be fair they weren't doing it out of benevolence. A chance to chop off Britain's leg was just too good to pass up regardless of the Crown's finances.

t1_dsx8yh8	-0.025800	*	Those previously in power are now probably chilling in a villa in italy...
t1_dsutq2x	-0.318200	*	If there were less than a hundred he had essentially no motivation other than ideological to do this, and the clear ideology piloting this decision is one of racism.
t1_dt1qfym	-0.250000	*	I know your anger, I know your dreams 
t1_dt1l2id	0.361200	*	Like a fucking shitload of steps.  China is fundamentally different from the US and it would take an entire restructuring of society as we know it for that to change in the states.

t1_dsdu6s9	0.557400	*	Clinton is really your idea of getting money out of politics? That's the funniest thing I've ever heard. 
t1_dsoiebe	0.102700	*	That last part is a good way to get people to ignore you
t1_dt7nj08	0.440400	*	Really? Then walk through the outskirts of NYC and tell me how safe you've felt. You've probably compared the city-centers in those big cities with the run down parts from your own.
t1_dsgv576	0.202300	*	Pretty sure the case of diet coke he drinks every day is poisonous enough.
t1_dtdfdcu	0.000000	*	Let's all just go off titles now and not read articles.  Makes sense.
t1_dtwbgp2	0.000000	*	basically legalizing pedophillia? Which laws are you talking about can you give me a source? 
t1_dt5xm5b	-0.275500	*	exactly & there are plenty of republicans who don't like Trump
t1_dt1m7gv	0.780200	*	Looks like it won't be that obnoxious this time around, http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article195687939.html  Presumably so the President doesn't look as bad.

t1_dsrnblr	-0.458800	*	>how is Brussels being petty?  Well, their head negotiator said the U.K. was basically turning its back on fighting ISIS by doing brexit  That seems very petty

t1_dto9ezx	-0.296000	*	Still no explanation...
t1_dt9eraw	0.951700	*	If you read the article, you'll find the truly cancerous bits were excised shortly after the US pulled out, and what remains is a pretty normal wealth and job creating free trade agreement.
t1_dtb0792	-0.102700	*	Nah. Just an Alexander Litvinenko reference.

t1_dshok72	-0.421500	*	Quickest way to ruin good sarcasm is to add an identifier. 
t1_dtm66yj	-0.599400	*	Number 2 is almost always accompanied with hatred of people of other countries and barring them from entering.
t1_dt1snsp	-0.250000	*	They should have just stuck a 15% to 20% tax on remittances in the tax reform bill.  This is more about [poking the democrats in the eye.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BTsES7PYMK4)
t1_dswzysh	0.440400	*	Thanks for clarifying this. /u/nav13eh's post was good, but this bit was really sticking in my head. Could really skew people's perspective of Canada indirectly, and the government directly. 
t1_dskch7h	-0.556200	*	Robert == Bobby == Policeman  Detective == Dick.  Close enough!

t1_dtqnhsp	0.000000	*	So, how does IQ work?  Also, while Canada doesn't appear to use IQ directly, it does appear to select for IQ by proxy by selecting for educated immigrants.
t1_dsetvz2	0.077200	*	It's like a modern version of The Emperor Has No Clothes.  He goes to a military parade with billions of dollars of the invisible planes and tanks he bought.

t1_dtc8nkg	0.624900	*	Nice original response. 
t1_dt54wci	-0.095100	*	That's not mutually exclusive with being watered down. The standards could be strict compared to present day, and lax compared to the older revision.
t1_dsntjld	0.000000	*	I think it was more so a response to the claim that only the USA tried to pull this, not that they didn't either.
t1_dtacqo7	0.758500	*	Because we don't have top secret security clearances...  Intelligence services protect their tools. (well...some do anyway..)

t1_dtpgukv	-0.648600	*	I mean they probably can't make much difference if they are dead. Not everyone's a soldier. I think people should go back and try and rebuild the country (If the regime lets them). 
t1_dt9tlqr	0.670500	*	Good luck getting the republicans to see that.  It's hard to make a person understand when his whole livleyhood depends on him not understanding.

t1_dt2pkab	0.893400	*	Sure. Yeah. Great. You're just commenting on a comment chain that's not discussing that. But whatever.  Cheers.

t1_dsvfojd	0.457600	*	Very interesting by the way.
t1_dsvd299	0.250000	*	No,it is not a drone. But people have successfully mislabeled them. A drone requires no human interaction aside from programming the flight path.
t1_dtil0b4	0.226300	*	Anti Nukes are completely unproven. Don't think Trump wont sacrifice LA to save face.
t1_dt5xont	0.000000	*	They impeached Clinton and he was still president. Big difference between being and impeached and being removed from office.

t1_dttfg7e	0.318200	*	The real problem is the health insurance companies basically writing the legislation for health care.  I would imagine that's why we have (had?) that fine for not having health insurance.

t1_dsro3kk	-0.243400	*	I don't think we're screwed either way, we can stop 95% of the damage if we stay.  The EU has no incentive to help us out and we have no bargaining chips.
t1_dt5cak3	0.296000	*	Yeah, there were a few high-up SS guys who were Gay, Jewish, etc.
t1_dso7mbr	0.000000	*	She claimed she was one, so a step sideways?

t1_dswd1e4	-0.670500	*	He's bought off politicians to push his agenda. That alone puts him into the 'bad guy' category.
t1_dsgf42z	-0.710100	*	Whatever. You haven't read them either and pomposity won't convince me otherwise. Anyone with two brain cells knows Trump's guilty so feeble what-ifs in his defense are pure horseshit. 
t1_dt8yttd	0.000000	*	Maybe he needs a dog more than anyone else.  Something to teach him what it is to be human. 
t1_dt1h1kq	-0.858800	*	By your logic germany is just as bad as china which is just as bad as north korea. No such thing my arse!

t1_dsm9d20	-0.222500	*	You don't know what freedom of speech is then. Social media companies are private companies, they can do what they want. You can say what you want but it doesn't mean there aren't consequences 
t1_dsjge31	0.804900	*	They do?  How so?  We have many independent news outlets, and a very strong foundation for a free press in our laws.
t1_dsmqhfp	-0.910900	*	Well the cane dealing was more slavery vs no slavery, right?
t1_dtlyily	0.411800	*	I am pretty sure that everything other than the two dicks is fake. I could be wrong on that but the link you shared even seems to acknowledge that.

t1_dst20ry	-0.852000	*	Mate it's not the wording, it's that the claim is total bullshit. Feminism does not appear to attract bandwagon-jumpers more than any other movement. That's just fucking wrong. 
t1_dsknyi6	0.150600	*	Emma Watson doesn't seem like the kind of person I could see myself liking.
t1_dspam2y	-0.695600	*	That sounds wrong. I'm guessing the reporter just looked up how far inland you have to go to get to 1650 feet elevation, but the actual wave and devastation would be significantly less than that.
t1_dt5y85u	0.000000	*	Precisely 
t1_dsjvt3o	0.000000	*	Maybe because they are? It's undeniable. Just look at the state countries in Africa and South America are in. Now compare them to European countries, or the US and Canada.

t1_dsyi0rj	0.000000	*	ya and Mitch McConell, the senate majority leader was one of the nays
t1_dt4u4vl	0.294400	*	Size matters though.  Canada has a 10th of our population, so them taking an 8th, let's say of our immigrants is more significant to them.
t1_dsgmnvf	-0.870100	*	> Except you can get tried for rape and murder which greatly increases your sentence.   30 years in Somaliland equals life.

t1_dt0wopr	-0.190100	*	Maybe a threat isn't the right way to think of it but it's easier to control an unstable nation, and thus control the resources within (e.g. Oil) 
t1_dtkz12s	-0.549900	*	She was a schoolgirl who attacked a classmate, its abhorrent but not exactly a normal case
t1_dsktjqg	-0.318200	*	You just saying its flat out false doesnt promote a counter argument. Basically youre just disagreeing, not conveying a different point of view. Thats not how things work.
t1_dtwxo6m	0.438900	*	I'd love to stick around but I've gotta go! *(leaves 3 hours later)*
t1_dto1dbj	0.314700	*	Okay, they won't threaten, they'd simply bribe them.  That still does work, so his point still stands.
t1_dtim1vv	-0.585900	*	Or they were at a wedding and handed the gun to a 5 year old kid who proceeded to shoot dad. Wait, that's a different video...
t1_dtbixcb	0.000000	*	In America liberal doesnt actually mean liberal. It just means left. But I get what you mean.

t1_dtye0tp	0.000000	*	Technically we aren't a democracy though, we're a constitutional republic. And more technicalities, Russia is currently a democracy. Don't be disingenuous. 
t1_dtbrir5	-0.476700	*	The westboro Baptist holding signs is a far cry from the average Muslims extremist. 
t1_dtc4pi3	0.417300	*	Judging by Put-Put's polling numbers, most Russians agree.
t1_dt7u5rg	0.790100	*	Man that sounds like a lot of work, wouldnt it be simpler to just announce that pedophiles will be executed? Voters will love it!
t1_dskamh6	-0.510600	*	I think you're right, the whole system is rotten. If only there was someone who could fix it, to drain the swamp if you will... 
t1_dts7f3l	-0.352700	*	so what you are saying is there are many people like you that don't care about sharing family pictures...so Facebook will decline because of it?
t1_dshdl27	-0.790600	*	Well MAGA has been around for a long ass time.  Hell Nixon ran on it in the 70's.
t1_dsr19nu	-0.757900	*	That's because everything in California is a risk of cancer.
t1_dselfh5	-0.361200	*	I'm not saying it isnt warranted, but bringing up some shit like that after he did this is just silly.
t1_dtbg4g9	0.796400	*	A long time ago. Cryptocurrency exchanges aren't banks though. If you keep your cryptocurrencies in a hardware wallet, your money is perfectly safe.

t1_dt9bqs9	0.559400	*	I think everyone hopes so. But question: everyone has the potential to be really wrong. If you are wrong will you accept it?  That's the quality of true honesty that we should all strive for

t1_dt3e7rq	0.318200	*	Hey. As long as you keep judging on results, that's fine by me. I just have a feeling you will do a total 180 and start defending him once the money laundering results come in...
t1_dt2w1ag	-0.175900	*	Local Bitcoins! DUHHHHHH. Just meet up with some rando in an alley and trade your millions of dollars of cash for Bitcoin. Money launderers are hella dumb this is hella easy.

t1_dtd1cs8	0.439700	*	Man, if only I had inherited 300 million dollars worth of Microsoft, Google, Apple, and Amazon stock in the early '00s. Guess I didn't try hard enough.

t1_dt9drtp	0.743000	*	That's true, and I agree with you for the most part.  But what do you do if you have no confidence that the house and/or Senate can be unbiased in their judgement?
t1_dsqvxqe	0.265800	*	I'll have to look into it. I remember reading about it a few years ago but never used it.   Yeah, the sprays typically don't do anything. I think it gives me piece of mind and helps with other pests.

t1_dtudcme	0.000000	*	Has it been done?

t1_dsjf3j3	0.000000	*	Still wouldn't change much because it would mean UK police spending time on an American agenda rather than policing UK streets.
t1_dslvwjx	0.003100	*	I've made the mistake of making that assumption before, they thought I was making fun of them.  Every time I've been asked that question, it has not been a joke.

t1_dtgxgu8	0.680800	*	That's obviously the preferred outcome, but ANY leaks is preferable to no leaks even if other leaks are being withheld. Yes having a fuller picture is always better.

t1_dtb02nb	0.000000	*	How Machiavellian!

t1_dso60bm	-0.458800	*	Yea. Which is why I've been arguing that Bill Clinton is a Dixiecrat in sheep's clothes this entire time. Your point?
t1_dsevpak	-0.284600	*	Sure, but he was 38 in the late 80s.  Back then you could raise a family on one income with no education.
t1_dtfkehw	0.726900	*	> You really think banks need money to hand out loans?  They usually need to have a percentage of the loan amount in safe investments as a reserve

t1_dswox9u	-0.510600	*	What would drive you to look up what subs a guy is in, and then post about it as an insult because he said Bingo. in a comment?
t1_dsyp647	-0.359500	*	At least the under pressure blowjob was realistic!
t1_dt9jt17	0.493900	*	And if it isn't their entire reason? That's a pretty fucking big presumption you've got there.

t1_dt9st9h	0.440400	*	Except that trump only talks about how good he is at things, he's more of a tell, don't show type.

t1_dsh89nn	0.055900	*	Agreed, but given the guy I was responding to, that was a can of worms I didn't want to get into.
t1_dthun3g	-0.872700	*	stopping terrorism = killing everyone.  [Can't start a fire when everything's ashes?](http://collections.museumca.org/?q=system/files/imagecache/2000_wide/S1-16.jpg)  
t1_dtvntaj	0.000000	*	Your response only deals with elephants. 
t1_dskh3yk	-0.887600	*	So is the problem that Trump thinks it's a shit hole, or that it got leaked to the press?  Because I can virtually guarantee most people think it's a shit hole.
t1_dska346	0.599400	*	Lmao what?
t1_dt1exho	-0.139600	*	The Henry Ford Museum does not trump the goddamn Smithsonian.   Goddamn it, Michigan. Havent you done enough?
t1_dt8v7zl	0.778300	*	Yeah it's the exact same agreement that the White House has, *don't break our rules or you can't come to our shit*.   And when the royals are big fucking news, you're gonna play ball. 
t1_dsvgxeg	-0.743000	*	It gets them irrationally mad and paints them in a corner that either exposes a hypocrisy now, or will down the line.

t1_dtff7mt	0.784500	*	>Why would a local Chinese chose to play on NA or European serve when the ping is 300 at minimum?  Maybe because playing with 300 ping is still better than playing on the Chinese servers. 
t1_dtmj00z	0.927400	*	Limits your options individually but gives you much greater bargaining power against countries like the US in situations like this and subsequently better trade deals.
t1_dt0d9f2	-0.318200	*	You lost me there. The vatican is not extremist, the us is. 
t1_dt1k9wa	-0.827100	*	Weapons trafficking. South America is littered with weapons. With the right organization as a result of an insurgency against the government the weapons will start pouring in. 
t1_dtbzail	0.077200	*	No. Its nowhere near as black and white like that, and the only people that portray it as such are uninformed or edgelords. 
t1_dsszuw3	-0.202300	*	We sold bonds to finance the war. When we had to pay those back with interest is where the jump comes from. A staggering amount of the debt is interest on bonds

t1_dt9bq4y	0.000000	*	They all independently confirmed it through their own sources (including Fox News). Theyre not just re-reporting the story. 
t1_dso5crb	0.469600	*	No, it was not just our sanctions. Lmao.  You actually thought it was only our sanctions?  Do you even know what the sanctions were before the Obama deal?  
t1_dtrxsae	0.421500	*	Ironic you said this in response to an article where the people of the UK are cheering the UK for skirting extradition rules.

t1_dt567z7	0.000000	*	He will only be president for four years.
t1_dt1b07m	0.827100	*	Sounds like China has political parties within their party. The only difference is China values experience over vanity. 
t1_dss008h	-0.677600	*	If it's a crime to receive it, going to the police isn't the best idea. Depends on if the police is competent or procedural, I guess.
t1_dt6mfj3	-0.296000	*	No, federal funding drives costs up. Always. Look at tuition costs for example.

t1_dta7pr6	-0.102700	*	I'd pay to watch a TV series about this.   
t1_dshjyqo	0.318200	*	Please read the whole comment.
t1_dsg8cyh	0.680800	*	It all depends on the site running it. For most of the large comment sites it's nigh unusable on mobile (Breitbart, for instance), but I'm okay with it on medium sized sites like Destructoid.
t1_dt7q6gn	0.361200	*	Just like Germany.
t1_dshtvy7	-0.401900	*	They make enough money to invest in the future. People in the US gave corporations the same rights as people, and yet they don't have any conscience. This is problem.
t1_dsoir30	0.735100	*	Its not matching up for me... it still looks like a perfect reference to dueling banjos. >_<

t1_dteymad	0.000000	*	Where did u read that?
t1_dtnupdl	0.476700	*	Much improved, and yet investigations still take decent time and effort.
t1_dtjq10s	-0.401900	*	Never had any problems up here in northern Sweden, the electricity usage is far far below what direct electricity would be.
t1_dsvxkiz	0.361200	*	It does if Americans aren't willing to work these jobs. As I said in one of my other comments, think jobs like fruit picking.
t1_dtvmmpx	0.150100	*	Don't derail because you can't think of anything else. No country is perfect and China shines in ways that the US fails to. 
t1_dtdmuas	-0.757900	*	>There are people in this country that blame labour( political left part)  for the '08 financial crisis   And those people own many of the national newspapers.

t1_dtqffk4	0.542300	*	At least you understand that you're prejudiced. Now, to respond to your rebuttal  >Taxation is an agreement between the government and the represented  How was this agreement entered into? 
t1_dsjaplu	-0.421500	*	Were hoping he cant stop lying once hes under oath. 
t1_dtrqlj2	0.361200	*	Not true... the only other sites that have real world profiles are Linkedin, maybe dating sites like Plenty of Fish/OK Cupid?
t1_dsjhdu1	-0.670500	*	Thank fuckin Christ I wasnt born in a majority Islamic country.   Knowing my mouth that would probably have been me getting stomped to death. Poor kid.

t1_dstdaj1	0.000000	*	You are now a moderator of r/Pyongyang
t1_dsttprr	-0.025800	*	Well I honestly fail to see how trump has improved relations with North Korea at all other than escalating everything to the brink of nuclear war,  but I see your point. 
t1_dsx6wpz	0.296000	*	I'm 38 and thinking I'm a responsible adult makes me want to giggle.  Then I remember how many other adults I know behave and I fear for the future of humanity.
t1_dt77l1z	0.557400	*	Oh dude, you're full of it if you think Kim believes he's a God.  He acts like he's mortal.

t1_dskupwz	0.000000	*	What about calatan?you should talk about both.
t1_dsudae2	0.000000	*	Only time I ever hear it now a days is when talking about someone upgrading from their old phone to a smartphone.   That or advertising.
t1_dtms9uy	0.000000	*	I don't think you know what *proven* means.
t1_dto0cmc	-0.526700	*	European countries arent worried about an American invasion in the slightest. Theyre much more worried about Russia annexing more regions and countries.
t1_dt2oz14	0.133600	*	A quick google shows an average wage of 3.1k USD a month (415,000 ISK). Which isn't shit honestly. Number comes from 2015.  Compared to 2011 number of US average salary of 3.7k monthly. 
t1_dt5w500	0.476700	*	I have a Drea.  I dream of the day when I get a high karma comment on a topic that I know well and discuss in detail. Rather than a single throwaway comment in a topic where I know next to nothing.
t1_dtwpyyl	-0.051600	*	There will never be revolution.  Russia loves Putin, and he is unifying.  If the central government were to collapse, Russia would become a collection of several seriously impoverished districts
t1_dtkv2n3	0.790600	*	And, if you can increase the efficiency of the production , it'll end up being pretty cheap.
t1_dsz438z	0.599400	*	But we're #1 in moon landings  Buy we're #1 in Super Bowls

t1_dt1snf7	0.624900	*	Yes I know. I was just giving a sense of scale.  Oh, and some billionaires (a small fraction of them) make a billion per year.
t1_dtp0iaq	0.000000	*	Point and chew? 
t1_dsm79qg	0.670500	*	As an immigrant from a shithole: stop.  I like it when people are interested in where I'm from and I like where I am more. 
t1_dte2rpq	-0.469900	*	Probably any weak leader would be more suitable for Russians at the moment. But weak dudes just don't stand a chance. Putin will more likely hand pick a candidate from his own crowd (xe0 la Yelstin).
t1_dtycz17	0.000000	*	That's the average household income, and many households have two working adults.
t1_dt9d945	0.305400	*	It's coming, Remmie, I just hope we can make it!  Edit: Probably should have went with Professor since you didn't say Q-Ball, but the sentiment is still there.
t1_dt4vkmu	0.401500	*	Don't bother.  People that turn matters of personal liberty into partisan bullshit are not worth the wasted effort.
t1_dt4sh97	-0.565800	*	So more BS like that guy said.... Its obnoxious to assume that people only hold opinions you disagree with because they are actually ignorant.

t1_dsluplp	0.000000	*	I think it's because they're the same ethnic group, and because most Koreans in America are probably not from North Korea. 
t1_dtd64jr	-0.296000	*	If britain was invaded they would have no nukes left
t1_dsornv2	0.848100	*	[With great power comes great respawnsitrilitries.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiWIOKKuyGE)

t1_dtmu2ps	0.273200	*	Well if they can have lifeboats and life jackets for 4000+ passengers on cruise ships...
t1_dsjto2x	-0.386500	*	That still says nothing about the people from those countries, dumbnut. You're not very bright, are you?
t1_dsxln7e	-0.458800	*	Not necessarily, they might want to just shoot it on their own property or out in the woods without having to go through all the legal procedures of obtaining a gun.
t1_dsk9jp5	0.077200	*	> The equivalent number for China is about 1.2%.  I think you made a boo-boo. 1.2% of the Chinese population is 16 million people.
t1_dsgy59c	0.612400	*	Pretty juicy gossip. Allegations so wild that there would be rioting if there was evidence behind them. But thank you for the write up link.
t1_dtsvg73	0.475400	*	A poorly informed one. Some of the biggest empires in the world have been religious ones. This is especially true in the 'Islamic world'.

t1_dsqnj3p	0.000000	*	Ye, my quality

t1_dsfaxgu	-0.557400	*	Why is doing in apostrophe?  You can look at Trump's own words to see he constantly talking shit about media. Except Fox news.
t1_dt0goii	0.000000	*	Im now more inclined to buy that HK pistol Ive been saving up for 
t1_dt1vdln	-0.696600	*	why does it matter if it's against its own people or against people who weren't citizens? Does it make it right if the US just went over to Canada and killed off some Canadians?
t1_dt0zwt7	-0.051600	*	Ok crazy.
t1_dt5out1	0.790600	*	Positive things typically are more beneficial and compatible with living in a free and prosperous society.  Negative things, not so much in many cases.  So no.
t1_dtk889x	0.634400	*	There's Foregen that's theoretically dedicated to regrowing foreskin for people like me who regret(not that I had a choice) having their bodies damaged. So that's a cool thought.

t1_dthyo2m	0.000000	*	It worked in the debates.
t1_dsx8q7v	0.571900	*	Which is honestly ridiculous. Most abortions have nothing to do with security of the person and restrict the life and liberty of the infant 
t1_dtrcie8	-0.296000	*	By that logic no tax-paying American is a civilian because they are directly funding the US military.

t1_dt1dods	0.000000	*	Contractors have.. wait for it.. contracts. Government shutdowns don't affect existing contracts.
t1_dt2nksa	0.000000	*	America basically condones what they are doing by continuing to trade with them.
t1_dt8qdxp	-0.102700	*	Then tell me, what is the difference between this, and just giving you're dog a clip round the head, or a mild kick when it doesn't do what you want.   Nothing, except you'd feel worse.

t1_dsjxd1q	-0.802500	*	No because they're not idiots. Just like Canada and any other country people want to go to.  But god forbid the US enforce its laws to the same extent as everyone else. That's racist.
t1_dtagi0e	0.492700	*	couple of years ago when russia got rid of DST, they realized how it's much more better it is to actually be in the summer time and once more switched +1 and kept it there.
t1_dsnsit7	0.737100	*	And it shouldn't be illegal.  That's called free speech.

t1_dt4sdas	0.000000	*	Just because your not there to witness it doesn't mean it doesn't happen. If a tree falls in the forest does it make any noise?
t1_dsxlgi4	0.000000	*	So you realise that the way of implementing it hasnt been established, so how can OP say he knows you need a licence when there is zero evidence?

t1_dsydl41	0.270900	*	He seems to care deeply about people dying and about the Palestinian movement so it doesn't look like he lacks empathy. 
t1_dtgarcw	-0.250000	*	ok this story makes me want to punch your bf's dad in the cunt, sorry
t1_dtkw0nt	-0.700300	*	[Acid throwing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_throwing).   Both for the rise of the attacks in England and for where the majority of attacks occur.
t1_dsixoif	-0.202300	*	Just as I thought, you Russian [Nauzees](https://youtu.be/ngjDT9HV_YU?t=35) just being petty again.   
t1_dt70bb9	0.557400	*	Yes.  Pussy hats, black lives matter, and amnesty for illegals are firmly centrist ideals.
t1_dsngiue	0.000000	*	P much, which is why T20 exists.   2, 3 hours, lots of people getting out and lots of people slogging it.
t1_dsl7kdq	0.361200	*	I agree with you.
t1_dsrv629	0.381800	*	I guess > It won't happen until it actually benefits American citizens and businesses.  
t1_dt5bkz3	0.542300	*	Well it certainly won't if we just assume that it can't.  Humans have achieved things that we once thought impossible and I'm not willing to sell our potential short.
t1_dsnz0pl	-0.735100	*	You can. . . . Sort of. Vote for the anti war candidate.
t1_dsj93wv	0.000000	*	People who can read.
t1_dsggr79	0.782800	*	Trying to convince some of his supporters that he doesn't care about the lower/middle class is like trying to convince a priest that god isn't real.
t1_dtr5zrq	-0.458800	*	> Don't see why every murder should be on global news though.  He doesn't believe that, except for the ones that help his narrative.  
t1_dtaz7wy	0.202300	*	That's fine, I'm just saying that from the outside, the reader can't tell if the journalist is making up sources or not.
t1_dt1uqdm	0.226300	*	Anarchy is a nice idea, but could never exist, social institutions would develop naturally and before you know it power structures would emerge. 
t1_dt91blq	-0.202300	*	Again  > Trump went on to say that he would not visit the UK unless there were guarantees that he would not be met with protests.  How would they guarantee there wont be protests?
t1_dstai2q	0.077200	*	eh it was almost two decades ago, forgive the mental hiccup, i'll edit it. Must of got mixed in with the night he called for revenge and a Palestinian child burnt alive was found the next day. 
t1_dsoe6es	0.318200	*	If you put words in his mouth, sure
t1_dtmtma1	0.000000	*	Have you seen our president?
t1_dt90a9b	-0.598300	*	This IS our revenge. For dumping our tea in the harbour.  You earned it guys! Well done.
t1_dsjyrvk	0.296000	*	> they rigged the primary by giving Hillary millions more votes than Bernie?  To be fair, that's generally how rigging works. 
t1_dsp046e	0.000000	*	Except this story doesn't even really prove that. It proves that an upper-level employee was corrupt due to his own politics. That's possible everywhere.
t1_dtdfbn5	0.000000	*	Oof.
t1_dsq5cje	0.190100	*	The second one.  If there's anything our brainless leaders like it's saying a whole lot but doing nothing about it.
t1_dshe4tf	0.000000	*	We just try to be as different as we can from americans these days
t1_dvim0mj	-0.077200	*	Sorry for the late reply, I was busy doing the dishes and walking my dog.
t1_dswpcq2	-0.117600	*	I fear that the Cons' wingnut faction are gawping across the border and thinking This is our moment, and it's going so well.
t1_dt7dsqf	0.000000	*	Horse is the same in Chinese as it is in Korean
t1_dsut2hb	-0.190100	*	His argument doesn't make any sense. If immigration means less power for workers, but companies are outsourcing the jobs anyway, it mean immigration isn't making any difference.
t1_dttw9rf	0.340000	*	lol, some reason I thought you were defending Bush.  I guess you're right, no one cares for Puerto Rico because they have no voting power.
t1_dsknu4b	0.318200	*	Fair comment
t1_dsxppya	0.000000	*	Erdogan was already in the process of purging the military, so it was sort of a now or never thing.
t1_dsyd1r6	0.526700	*	You're right.   The art of hiding is convincing people you're someone else. There are probably autistic people who understand *The Art of War* better than anyone.
t1_dsxud7u	0.000000	*	Oh, did that new law where everything is exactly, 1:1, the same as every other thing come into effect, already? I thought it was next month.
t1_dspm70l	0.000000	*	Where does one find the Podcast?
t1_dsw59fz	0.000000	*	Joke's on you, pops: we got married at the courthouse three years ago.   
t1_dt4vn8f	0.670500	*	Thanks, I am in total agreement with you and am just trying to get more people to realize what you and I (and those who are actually affected by these policies) have already realized.
t1_dtbwe0v	0.340000	*	So how do you explain the dollar taking in value since the election?
t1_dsl0sui	0.316000	*	Doesn't seem like we are winning anything.
t1_dswkw0y	0.421500	*	Really? That's your response. lol 
t1_dso06dm	0.900100	*	i enjoy that there's a version of the world in your mind where the military/government/authorities are perfectly, meritoriously competent   there's nuclear ordinance that is simply *missing*
t1_dt333at	0.000000	*	Irish people are also on an island, but they mostly speak English, in addition to the languages that are native to their island. 
t1_dso82y9	0.214400	*	I wish it was, but I don't think it is. You can usually tell by checking their comment history, but his account only has ten karma...
t1_dtnsxbl	-0.786500	*	That's my point. He said it was Changing demographics and social mores, even though it could just be that men are less ashamed of reporting this crime.  
t1_dsk6tue	0.000000	*	Apathetic/Ignorant people should make an effort to reverse that, then show up and make a decision about the future of their country.
t1_dtf1ida	0.000000	*	Answer the question Steven.
t1_dt8txiy	0.709600	*	Either that or lose him in Siberia...either way is a win win
t1_dtkuyf2	-0.557400	*	Shit. 
t1_dsr1z1j	0.840200	*	Try coming a little farther northwest . Its beautiful up in the Puget Sound and great air .
t1_dsqlou4	0.177900	*	Dear lord, these people are moronic. They decline medical attention lol
t1_dt9my0l	0.669600	*	The best part was when it crashed!
t1_dtmgjdb	0.000000	*	....yeah but movement is one side buying and another selling with very very real money.
t1_dt9tar4	0.648300	*	More than likely his followers would say if the president can't remember certain events then we can't be held personally responsible for our actions either. I don't remember raping that woman
t1_dt5zw0n	-0.115400	*	> but once Trump does something  We're supposed to cheer for Trump destroying thousands of American jobs because it's something? 
t1_dsf6hag	-0.296000	*	You're right, those things are awful and shouldn't have happened.   Amnesty is important for healing.   What's your point in this context, though? 
t1_dsnnz9s	0.585900	*	Let's hear your brilliant analysys.
t1_dsm9jyw	-0.238200	*	Of course, Lizardmen are not real. We are all perfectly normal human beings with our many normal human organs and disgusting, oily human skin. Humans are entirely in control of this dirt ball planet.
t1_dsuh2ci	-0.636900	*	Hey, If Stormy Daniels can criticize his small hands, who are we to disagree?
t1_dt1asgg	0.401900	*	You think Somalian Socialist party was secretly capitalist? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somali_Revolutionary_Socialist_Party
t1_dt1tqwi	0.493900	*	Look at this fatcat, flaunting his wealth.
t1_dtaea4q	0.153100	*	Not my intention. I actually haven't met any, to my knowledge, but I'm sure they're just fine. My problem is indeed with the governments in the region. Israeli, too. 
t1_dtjeqb1	0.102700	*	Sounds like the reason I would much rather pee in the forest than in a port-a-potty.... sadly it's just safer and cleaner to get the hell away from your fellow man sometimes, lol.
t1_dsiuf86	0.000000	*	I guess the population difference is just too large at that point (8mil vs 2.5mil) to be ameliorated by public transit
t1_dtji6j0	0.296000	*	No you didnt / no you didnt / yes you are. Good day sir. 
t1_dswk2ud	0.510600	*	and those groups are still free to operate.  how do you not see that? 
t1_dsya8dy	-0.840200	*	Am I wrong that I understood there to be no crude oil involved?

t1_dta4zk0	-0.821700	*	FUCK THE TENNESSEE VOLS!? HEY FUCK YOU, BUDDY!
t1_dtmmkrt	-0.296000	*	No, it's not what you tried to counter with. China has 4 times the people, per capita is the only reasonable way to measure such things.
t1_dti5k5o	0.000000	*	A full house cleaning is needed... You could say it would be something of a draining of the swamp.
t1_dt7akex	-0.708200	*	Which is more important, revenge or stopping the problem?
t1_du4pipn	0.128000	*	For Israxebl, yes For the rest of the world, famously no
t1_dss6289	0.000000	*	Maybe take a lesson.
t1_dseqxsb	0.401900	*	That's because no matter how brilliant a show it is, it hasn't been written by someone living paycheck to paycheck for at least 20+ years.
t1_dswrtp6	-0.325400	*	Gillard was an awful PM. So was Abbott but those Labor years aren't ones I would want repeated. 
t1_dtrf2z1	0.000000	*	They should just have a setting you can fiddle with to change how videos are recommended.. i.e. new stuff vs similar stuff or a combo
t1_dt6xv0q	0.216800	*	Does the indigenous population receives less funding in whatever forms, than other Canadian citizens? Yes or no.   What's the conclusion?
t1_dsmpr5i	-0.128000	*	It's pretty... odd though. It feels weird for someone to have that much affinity with an area. The people who cling to something like that are usually off in some way
t1_dttzfwy	0.000000	*	That's not how percentages work...
t1_dt75ux0	-0.202300	*	it's possible they might have large deferred tax liabilities. 
t1_dsuurv2	0.865800	*	Actually Im just going to smoke some weed and call it a night. Thank god for trump and thank god for this headline. It gives me something to smile about as I try to fall asleep. 
t1_dsnbowx	-0.631000	*	I suppose, but Alaska looks big and uninhabited to me. Plus they've got a bunch of ground based interceptor missiles there. I think they're in case of a Chinese or Russian attack.
t1_dt94h5s	0.000000	*	I think it was less I'd tap that and more we were going to begin coitus but she wasn't tested. I took it the first way, but the second way fits with the fable.
t1_dtgl7yk	-0.526700	*	It's an example of outright lying. Gaslighting is making someone question their own sanity. 
t1_dsx1ntt	0.409800	*	Are you going to respond to anything else I said or just the fact that I am pro-life?  Do you believe any abortion is ok? Up to the point of birth?
t1_dtf87d9	0.000000	*	Only after 3 minutes of the post being up will it add the star. Hence the existence of ninja edits.
t1_dt70p3v	-0.153100	*	im all for a fair, unavoidable tax rate. Hell, I'd be for reducing corporate taxes if that is what is needed to gather support for closing loopholes
t1_dtvhren	0.419900	*	Thank you!

t1_dstoujo	-0.757900	*	That's exactly what's happening. Lets humiliate trump together by beating USA in women's soccer
t1_dtdadlu	-0.296000	*	No wonder he's reversing everything Obama did, he got third degree burns during that roast.
t1_dszri2w	0.000000	*	Democracy wouldn't apply to monarchies/dictatorships/etc that had the same economic system.
t1_dt7e394	0.296000	*	Ok.
t1_dte2568	0.077200	*	Why would the Republican controlled U.S. govt want to nationalize?  They're trying to privatize the postal service right now.
t1_dtk86wc	0.000000	*	It is outdated because we dont use this constitutional tool as we should. Its a power check we should keep, but we should use it.
t1_dtelc9p	0.636900	*	That's actually a best case scenario. 
t1_dtx1xve	0.470300	*	In all fairness, one of the campaigns that ran the hardest against Trump was Trump's campaign, so it's still true in a way.
t1_dteqqiw	0.493900	*	Worth watching:  * [The Original Trump Haters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pbTmXsfiYk) (Full Frontal with Samantha Bee -  7:11 min)
t1_dtoribi	0.000000	*	I never mentioned anything regarding the US in this regards.
t1_dtcnubc	0.659700	*	It's easy, I like to make a big pot of chili or lentil soup or something. Doesn't need to be fancy
t1_dtx3ad0	0.701700	*	In Oregon, vote by mail is 100% - not just absentee. We literally have no poll booths. Nobody has to try to get time off work, or stand in line. Its a pretty sweet system. 
t1_dt8f80u	0.000000	*	I thought every tic tac toe game ends in a tie.
t1_dtxu5cy	0.000000	*	Nope!

t1_dt3bsmr	0.072100	*	I'm not arguing about that at all. I'm just saying American military personnel are more than in the right to say no to an order they feel is unlawful. 
t1_dtluw92	-0.051600	*	Yes, similarly to how far right are over-represented in white people for race attacks.
t1_dsf4o7u	0.421500	*	Laws still around. Guys like spacey and Weinstein arnt in jail and probably never will be. If you want them to have thier jobs back. Go do something about it

t1_dtxae7g	0.000000	*	You have to register to vote in NZ and Australia. I imagine the difference here is you can mail in your registration and other various means of smoothing out the process unlike in the States.
t1_dt7kxiw	0.000000	*	The GCSE teaches you a lot, but isn't compulsory. Plenty of people just don't do history GCSE.
t1_dsghjwj	0.361200	*	 They're just asking that the wild card for the common man do wild, unconventional things he promised to do. That's why a non-politician was elected. 
t1_dstac3b	0.000000	*	If you only do it to brown people it is. 
t1_dtwjmes	0.000000	*	My man
t1_dt8xc2v	0.000000	*	Exactly, I dont know how people can feasibly believe that.
t1_dsneu8e	0.340000	*	They would wipe out our pacific fleet giving them and China to move the bulk of their forces into our allies countries. 
t1_dtjb041	-0.168000	*	Do you think they cost the same? Retrofitting benches and solving the homeless problem?
t1_dso7lqi	0.000000	*	DISCUSTING, next! 
t1_dsgljc7	-0.024300	*	I can't, my family hates to play it with me. Between my pure efficiency, and my stealing from the bank, even through I don't need to, I wind up pissing them all off.
t1_dt1meaj	0.000000	*	Not as a by product. Air conditioners are called conditioners and not air coolers because the majority of work done by an AC unit is dehumidification. 
t1_dtf4bmq	-0.585900	*	If Israel is to be prosecuted, you might as well prosecute every poor soul brainwashed by groups like the PLO.
t1_dsrg2rf	0.696900	*	This person is a child and clearly is motivated by resentment more than the desire to convey reliable information.
t1_dt2mg0m	0.582900	*	To be fair, two years ago every discussion would eventually lead to a fucking Harambe joke, so at least we've moved on to something more consequential. 
t1_dtq510t	0.669600	*	So it's all political now? Gotta love all the mental gymnastics.  Antarctica != Arctic tho
t1_dskuou7	0.000000	*	Were you able to get a picture of that page that mentions it?

t1_dtn82uf	0.381800	*	My point exactly. The unwillingness of white nationalists to do anything that benefits other races *even when it's a net plus for them* proves it.
t1_dtqsa68	-0.175900	*	Australian unis moved to a pay-to-learn model when it realized how much Asian parents were willing to pay!
t1_dsevfe2	0.458800	*	Welcome to 2016, just wait till he finally gets elected...
t1_dsm91oj	0.340000	*	Yup, was on phone and simplified it a bit, ended up cutting that bit out and forgot to change the other paragraph. Thanks for pointing that out.
t1_dsknfhm	0.361200	*	Like Muslims blow up public places for Allah?

t1_dtevf3r	0.000000	*	... and when she does?
t1_dsy5y61	-0.557400	*	So... If I wanted to try Tim's coffee before it went to shit, I'd go for McDonalds, then? 
t1_dtldr2q	0.000000	*	Needs more leaches and bloodletting 
t1_dtgbfks	0.557400	*	It seems like you didn't understand what Is said.  The UK, across almost all segments of society, will need to accept a lowered standard of living.
t1_dsvtw00	-0.680800	*	No tax is not a **subsidy**. If they gave you a 30% rebate it would be.   Norway are looking at the future and see that ICE cars are a stupid 20th century idea.... and it's working.
t1_dtibnkg	-0.202300	*	Yes, shut up and go away before I school your old punk ass
t1_dtnhrf8	0.361200	*	You can test it yourself. Go post something innocuous (not explicitly anti-trump) and youll get like 50 upvotes out of nowhere.
t1_dsiwfyc	0.900100	*	Not sure what electric bikes you're talking about, but even the super basic models of Zero bikes start at upwards of 10 grand. Those base models also only have about a 90 mile range.

t1_dtd044e	0.840200	*	Taking benefits to strong arm someone out of a vote?   Yeah, pretty sure that's illegal in America.
t1_dt0089a	0.718400	*	sounds like a fascinating book 
t1_dtddr9w	0.401900	*	Yes, only people who demonize Russia should be listened to.

t1_dsni9g2	0.318200	*	Which makes them a prime target. The Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor for a reason. Crippled the Pacific fleet, we just managed to rebuild and expand it within months
t1_dtghgc6	-0.270800	*	Not really.  Just have a system like Australia where you either vote, present a valid reason why you cannot vote, or pay a very small fine.  Apathy is the main enemy of democracy.
t1_dt5xex9	0.000000	*	This is called sealioning  http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/sea-lioning
t1_dstp5g1	-0.340000	*	Seems to me that firing RPGs to the house is a bit more than acting unprofessionally to say the least.
t1_dskj302	0.340000	*	He is a politician, he represents his people, he makes comments. It is from there it gets reported and shared. If it wasn't for the upvotes and comments, you'd never have seen this. 
t1_dt74ktt	0.226300	*	Okay.
t1_dsxpj2s	-0.886000	*	It would be most likely to see Erdogan killed, some separatist movement or whatever basicaly making Trukey collapse than NATO lose control of the Bosporus strait. 
t1_dt7uqwe	-0.354000	*	It's strange cause I don't think it's worth that much

t1_dsl2dcv	0.510600	*	I don't think there would be any situation in which the US security services would have 'full control' of anything in the UK. Why would MI5 and MI6 allow that?

t1_dsfe3p2	0.624900	*	Great

t1_dtjhw4r	-0.207500	*	I wouldn't say what I said with so much certainty if I *hadn't* been in such situations. I've been in far worse, actually.

t1_dslh299	0.750600	*	The good news, if you can call it that, is that there are so many unfilled positions, hardly anyone will need to be purged at all. Simply filling empty spots would make a huge improvement.

t1_dtg6og8	-0.510600	*	Its just a dumb phrase that is literally untrue because wetness is the way humans experience water, not how water experiences water.

t1_dsk4mq8	-0.908000	*	No, that's just how the racists on the right deflect legitimate criticism.  Now they get to define what progressive is.    Hurr Durr the left is the real racists!  Give me a break.

t1_dsm3qdf	0.362600	*	This is the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard.  You're saying for comparisons absolute value is a better representation than proportional?

t1_dsnwlxg	0.000000	*	Sha-sha!

t1_dts322m	-0.571900	*	Maybe mainlanders/CCP should reflect on why HKers hate them and just them so much.

t1_dt6t19a	0.396400	*	Do you have a link that says that conservatives in the US don't care about immigration from the middle east? Good data would certainly trump my anecdote if it were there.

t1_dt5crtl	0.051600	*	Yep, that's why I have no problem with Trump pulling us out of this shitshow. It's the one good thing he's done.

t1_dti8bwm	-0.802000	*	Making people disappear through military or clandestine means heavily implies killing them. You don't generally refer to arresting someone as making them disappear.

t1_dtoerjv	0.000000	*	I see you are being downvoted for a stating basic fact. It seems idiots infest much of Reddit as they do much of the world.

t1_dtbyph6	-0.261700	*	It's also the wrong message. Most people in Afghanistan don't recognize themselves as Afghani but rather what their heritage is.
t1_dtj3n3r	0.361200	*	Sounds like a temporal fallacy to me. Are you saying people in the bronze age were sociopaths?

t1_dtrvuaw	-0.862500	*	No offence, but then you are an idiot. Even a small nuclear conflict will probably wipe out 99% of the human population on earth. Even if they are nowhere near where the bombs are dropped.

t1_dtdjl45	-0.163000	*	WTF is your point? Vetting is hard. This is what I said. Nobody is particularly good at it. Your god Mueller let a hillary shill be his second  in command.
t1_dt6b5cm	0.077200	*	But that supports the belief that they 'could'. It is all interpretation because no one has done it so far.

t1_dspsk30	0.050500	*	If you look to history over the past 100 years communism absolutely does not provide freedom for the many. Far more people are free under capitalist systems than there were under communist ones.

t1_dtkwk6o	0.361200	*	I am the point where I believe protests and mass marches are about as effective as sharing social media posts, because governments can ignore those without consequences.

t1_dtl226d	0.476700	*	Yea, being arrested for it is definitely a risk. Not having a convincing substitute kinda shoots the idea down for good though.

t1_dt06jqq	-0.433600	*	Capitalism is when one guy buys the apples for less then theyre worth and resells them for more than he paid.   Capitalism just means theres a guy in the middle getting paid to sit on his ass. 
t1_dtkuo8t	0.038200	*	It's exactly what it is. Every single time an individual or country takes a stance that Israel does not like, it cries antisemitism.

t1_dsn76x1	0.226300	*	Also, testing situations during shift changes isnt uncommon. You dont know when something may happen and you always need to be prepared.

t1_dsp21q5	0.623200	*	Facts are irrelevant and open to opinion, its 2018. In my opinion, could very well be in excess of 100,000,000. In *fact* it most certainly would be. Because I said so.

t1_dskxwvm	-0.318200	*	Trump being far right, republican or center would imply he has a consistent political stance.   This is simply not the case, either due to a total lack of morality or just plain senility.
t1_dtwlszc	0.318200	*	Fairly sure being funded by several first world countries will do that to you.  However, genocide tends to overshadow that.
t1_dt6u2re	0.000000	*	From Atlanta. Can confirm that there's a shitload of people moving here from Chicago and Cali.
t1_dt0mnbc	0.897900	*	Sentience is impossible to measure. Intelligence in animals is hard to measure. Pigs are pretty intelligent. Who knows if we eat intelligent and sentient fish, or even plants.
t1_dsp4xm5	0.714900	*	What would that shockwave have looked/felt like for an average person in the US?  Like a sonic boom?  Less quiet?  Would it rattle windows 3 times?

t1_dtvefk1	-0.493900	*	brain damage confirmed
t1_dteuffk	-0.261700	*	To be fair, that is how we pronounce twat, but not what. What is generally pronounced as wut.

t1_dthf7ea	-0.458800	*	Same with democrats. It sucked all around for contemplative Americans, which appeared to be in the minority on both sides.
t1_dto5gfp	0.226300	*	Maybe EU should do the same - select what kinds of British to allow in EU based on whims of the economy or the way wind blows in politics. How would that make you feel?

t1_dsh8o6p	0.000000	*	TIL I'm Canadian.
t1_dtp5cnl	0.440400	*	Quite the opposite, actually. Americans tend to refer to NGOs as non profits and the rest of the world tends to refer to them as NGOs.   
t1_dslo30l	0.025800	*	It does if you're going to go on welfare in the US. Immigration should be restricted to those who can meet the requirements to support themselves without welfare.

t1_dttbe0g	0.000000	*	What about it?

t1_dt9cb1c	-0.680800	*	What the hell made you presume I felt otherwise? Also, if I didnt believe in human-caused climate change, you could perhaps use softer methods of persuasion.

t1_dsgh9d5	0.000000	*	From my understanding that's what it is though, if they ceased activity in the US the states wouldn't have any leverage over them.

t1_dtbzf2u	0.526700	*	It's pretty simple: they think it's true.  What they get is spreading a fucked up story they believe is true.  Keep posting that link and more people will be aware that it's false.
t1_dskxg4a	0.401900	*	Smart
t1_dtge43a	-0.647600	*	Oh fuck I'm stupid. Thanks!
t1_dt2pkm3	-0.624900	*	Ugh, a whole country just stuck in arrested development.  Can you imagine how unbearable a population would be if the wisest/most mature they had to offer was your average modern 25 year old?  
t1_dtvwr5y	0.666200	*	Lol sure. You going to answer the other questions? Or are we done here?
t1_dssvaya	-0.025800	*	Yes and no. If you lack food water or shelter, you will be unhappy.  You can totally be unhappy for other reasons, but those ones are the ones that are easily solvable by cash 
t1_dsjyeze	0.510600	*	He started with saying if its good enough for the president its good enough for me Im certain you died already so RIP.

t1_dsog0or	-0.594500	*	I'll have to look into what the filters are rated for exactly then. I use them to do automotive bodywork kind of stuff, so a lot of nasty plastic and fiberglass dust, along with paints and solvents. 
t1_dstdmh6	0.676700	*	Thanks for this.   If that is Bannon's testimony, does that then put Don Jr. on the stand? And how likely is it he'll tell the truth? (I'm guessing, not very).

t1_dshdya3	0.833800	*	Ya but it was mostly Kissinger's realpolitik that was successful. Nixon, like always, was just the elected stooge to accomplish what eventually lead to the collapse of the Soviet Union.

t1_dtp8ck3	0.000000	*	It's less of a coin, and more of a spectrum. With Nazis as the far end of one side, and most SJWs in a place that looks centrist by comparison.
t1_dtktjqm	0.362500	*	> I mean it wasn't industrial levels of persecution and genocide so sure.  No, it was centuries of people living in peace with *some* but not that many cases of persecution.

t1_dt8kdo8	-0.631900	*	Doesn't help that the reactor was designed to produce plutonium for nuclear weapons and the Soviet authorities decided not to order the nearby town's population to evacuate until 3 days after.
t1_dtrkta6	0.051600	*	Black people are a minority. Truly shocking that there are fewer of the minority than the majority ethnic group.

t1_dsnaapg	0.184700	*	Are you saying Islam doesn't exist or fear of Islam doesn't exist, because both of those seem like fairly stupid assertions?

t1_dthdbu2	0.000000	*	Correct, this is simple root cause analysis. 
t1_dsvcw3e	-0.817600	*	At least bad publicity/boycotting works in this case. When the state murders unarmed citizens not much changes.

t1_dt24rca	-0.340000	*	Yet phone such as redmi are also dirt cheap and can be used for more than 3 years. Cheap doesn't have to mean throwaways. 
t1_dsl1y7y	-0.401900	*	Although he did a genocide, at the time that was what most of the public wanted him to do. So far most of the public dislikes Every thing Trump does. 
t1_dsurs70	0.166800	*	Oh, I wasn't being serious. Just mocking reddit :P
t1_dso4zyo	-0.670500	*	Shoving down our throat is some of that OG American propaganda.  Fuck off, Kissinger

t1_dsm0o44	-0.335300	*	Funny. The most outwardly racist things I've heard were from people with latin or asian backgrounds.  Guess it depends who you talk to.
t1_dtdtkfn	-0.391900	*	It sounds like you're saying something but I don't get it. Is this some edgy Fight Club style reset? Cause that's not going to happen.

t1_dtgnlbv	0.000000	*	You dont think so.
t1_dskhzs4	0.929800	*	But how can we trust you to be honest? You should, like, fill out another piece of paper, claiming you are the most honest person ever! That will help, like the terror questions!
t1_dsro6kw	0.202300	*	Makes you wonder why they don't just put the filters on top of the coal-fired power plant stack instead of in another area...
t1_dsh4wyv	0.769300	*	It's not terrorism.  Israel is trying to survive,  many like you would be happy to see it destroyed.

t1_dsxdbp0	-0.943700	*	Fuck off. Price controls suck but those people are in a national emergency a la hurricane shit. Hoardingand price gouging  is a real problem
t1_dtendcv	0.361200	*	I mean ... poultry like chicken eat meat (especially in the wild) and so do pigs. Ever saw a chicken eat a mouse?
t1_dstrvln	-0.318200	*	Another liberal who ignored the actual quotes from the South Korean government and quoted the opinion from the journalist. Spicy. 
t1_dtivh7j	0.202300	*	We don't have state owned production. And subsidizing solar here was in response to subsidized coal and oil and gas here. Basically leveling the already stacked playing field. 
t1_dseqcve	-0.886000	*	That's literally what caused the entire thing. Not the blowjob thing, that was just a scandal - lying about it was the worst thing.

t1_dtx1kkw	-0.243900	*	America is OK that Russia hacked their elections and your government can't even manage to put sanctions on Russia, so the big talk seems a little ridiculous
t1_dtrdnkh	-0.492400	*	Why is it so overwhelmingly moms that post pseudoscience articles and stuff?

t1_dsqxks6	0.361200	*	The distance from Miami to Seattle is less than the distance from Tehran to Paris. And the distance from Seattle to Hawaii is a heck of a lot greater than the distance from Paris to the UK.

t1_dtheelk	-0.615900	*	Yeah, wear your hijab. I just don't care to read op-eds about how it's empowering or hear about hijabi feminism.   I'm just skipping over that shit.
t1_dsiofdi	0.056700	*	Well the majority of people did not benefit. If the majority had better critical thinking skills, maybe it wouldn't have happened.
t1_dtbwdmh	-0.226300	*	Youre confusing secularism with atheism and theyre not related at all
t1_dta8h89	0.659700	*	Miss is perfectly fine. She was just looking for things to complain about. If they called her Mrs or ma'am, she would have had a fit about being called old. 
t1_dswxtt2	-0.670500	*	Free speech and hate speech are not opposed to each other. You should be free to voice your hate no matter how much I may disagree with it.
t1_dtggyw1	0.492600	*	Comments are great.  Nobody expects the Dutch inquisition!  Though I'm personally wondering If the Dutchmen are watching the watchmen, who's watching the Dutchmen?.

t1_dsft9e9	0.480900	*	> A government that is justified in banning you from drinking a sugary soda  The government didn't ban anybody from eating or drinking anything.  This is a non-starter argument.
t1_dt8wzn5	-0.241100	*	Don't worry they love snowflakes..
t1_dsnsvtr	-0.827100	*	A lot of people were killed by wolves. That literally lends no credence whatsoever to you claim, let alone the fact you're using Wikipedia.

t1_dtlcatt	-0.585900	*	Then why make up stories about opening up dams to flood Gaza, or Israeli doctors practicing eugenics on immigrants, or poisoning Palestinian water supplies?
t1_dsglpmu	-0.273200	*	No, the USSR backed Kim Il Sung's Fully Communist North Korea. They are two very different countries to Russia and Kim Jung Un's North Korea.  
t1_dtbz79b	-0.510600	*	If you want to pick one hillbilly and extrapolate that to Americans then that's your problem.  I know of a whole region of assholes in Canada and I still know better than to say you Canadians.

t1_dtuqk6g	-0.571900	*	I personally know like 3 or 4 people that deal with that, and have seen many more on Reddit. I wonder what triggers that? It would really bum me out if I had to quit smoking because of panic attacks

t1_dsxdpur	-0.416400	*	Didn't Turkey concede those territorial rights in its peace treaty with the allies though? Or were the areas in questions areas they did not concede in the treaty but never managed to gain control of?

t1_dt8ttxn	-0.493900	*	That's how he behaves when he's afraid of punishment. Imagine how he'll behave with absolutely nothing holding him back.

t1_dt0mnft	-0.458800	*	OR it's understanding how people became crazy and stopping THAT before it occurs again. 
t1_dsx1qbj	0.000000	*	The Canadian government's definition of human rights includes reproductive rights.  It would be inconsistent, even for a politician, to fund groups campaigning against human rights.
t1_dsqvn6k	-0.296000	*	Why no, not at all.  Go right ahead.
t1_dt3kdvm	-0.557400	*	Yeah it says relocate because they are massacring our men and raping our women and children.

t1_dsh4gxa	0.676900	*	I'd say it's pretty true when the US accounts for almost 20% of all their exported goods. The goods they do make the US doesn't really want to make since its so cheap to do in china. 
t1_dtegph6	0.000000	*	Let's sprinkle some crack on em and get outta here.
t1_dsuw4lm	0.902200	*	You're talking past each other. There are multiple things going on here and as things are right now, nobody wins. Well.. rich people win.

t1_dtvhosj	0.000000	*	If only our social development would match our technological. We could literally live in a utopia, it is not impossible in the slightest.

t1_dsok6vh	0.000000	*	\#NotAllTrumpettes 
t1_dsshnl5	0.296000	*	Yeah.  The off state of the quicklime beds is, in fact, lime.  The point is to capture and sequester the relatively concentrated CO2 offgas during the lime->quicklime transition of the rotation.

t1_dseurgj	0.338400	*	Plato invented Atlantis, so it becoming a real place would be more surprising.

t1_dtjg7bg	0.557400	*	Yes and perhaps this person is failing to realize that the media's outrage might be the *reason* that the director has changed their mind. This is the free press doing it's job perfectly
t1_dtd6a8m	0.557400	*	You sure think youre a smartie pants dont you
t1_dt42kbh	0.493900	*	I guess I care about as much about Russian laws as Russia does for international laws, not at all in other words.
t1_dtd35kl	-0.859500	*	Yeah, but you already said he is a criminal/traitor so you must have compelling evidence.   Unless of course you just feel he's a criminal because you're so angry at him.

t1_dt20vk3	-0.680800	*	If they did they would end the Republicans. All those extra blue states. America would become a hell of a different place.
t1_dsv8frj	0.000000	*	There are some labor-intensive jobs that Americans just don't want/can't hack. [Vice News did a segment on a shrimping boat](https://youtu.be/cM_MdQMA0VI?t=6m12s) showing exactly this kind of labor.

t1_dt185wn	-0.932500	*	That's an argument you've made up. I've never heard a politician give that explanation for the death penalty for terrorism. And it's not even the reason other people in the thread here give either.

t1_dsjd0ju	0.571900	*	best part is at best they might not vote for Trump in 2020.   Must the regretters will probably still vote for Trump again because they've all been convinced that it's D for Devil
t1_dsdmztr	-0.202800	*	Dunno. Wasn't there. I just got told.   Impression given wasn't too impressive in any case.

t1_dtss1sy	0.538900	*	It's not even about spine, a lot of them don't want to change anything since their priority is making businesses happy. Big pharma pays for their campaigns... 
t1_dsjozr8	-0.003600	*	Exactly. He said he didn't want people from the s* hole country. Obviously means that's what he thinks of the people. It's not defensible, and only someone who agrees would try. 
t1_dtpcfkt	-0.202300	*	Didn't they capture a bunch of US equipment from the Iraqi military and also acquire some when US trained and armed rebels joined them?

t1_dtlh1rf	0.177900	*	We can stop it. It's our only hope.
t1_dt6it6y	0.427600	*	No, because I can publish a story that Scientists Just Discovered The First Ever Life On The Moon!, and that's clearly both fake news and also not propaganda of any kind. Just digging for views.

t1_dte0q9h	0.493900	*	Russia pretty much is a dictatorship at this point, the government is full of corruption and their elections are about as democratic as North Korea's.
t1_dtm0bwb	0.571900	*	Excellent. Ill check these out.
t1_dtl4h33	0.750600	*	Not offended. Just like to answer folks. Habit from work I guess. Hopefully you have been enlightened to other views instead of just trashing the messenger.

t1_dtqpmi1	-0.381800	*	Not Japan. The upper echelons of the Japanese government, including the emperor. The Allies basically demanded that they hand themselves over to be executed for war crimes.
t1_dsfn63q	0.709600	*	I dont see how the press has lost any freedom at all honestly.
t1_dtogyx3	-0.612400	*	How do Italians attack Africans if there arent Africans in Italy? I think it actually does solve the problem 
t1_dtbz7mq	0.709600	*	Honestly think they are going to sell 10 times as many planes thanks to Airbus. especially when they start building the 500. This is the 737 for the modern age.

t1_dsmmw18	-0.905300	*	See now this is the exact reason why people say anti-muslim protests are racist; because the sort of person who does shit like this doesn't actually care if they're muslim, they care if they're brown.
t1_dsv8iw5	-0.318200	*	Yep.... Sounds like bullshit.   Of course, that's not what were talking about.

t1_dsjydmx	-0.918600	*	Counting a dead infant differently (as a miscarriage) doesn't make it any less dead. It literally has zero effect on the outcome. Lying about the numbers doesn't change anything.

t1_dt9zoue	0.421500	*	Agreed.    But I refuse to let facts get in the way of my jokes.  ;)
t1_dtkzxyi	-0.421500	*	You would think with the recklessness it would be a huge health crisis already. Drug resistant bugs are no joke.
t1_dsmk7en	0.659700	*	Actually good fertilizer is extremely expensive and not scalable. The plants like alfalfa and hay eaten by a large amount of livestock grow on land not suitable for other forms of agriculture.

t1_dt2c3ib	-0.153100	*	And the tanks ostensibly help people from either side. Other than the blatant dick move on shooting an unarmed medic, there's also the fact you might need them in the future.

t1_dte61wk	0.000000	*	I have yet to meet a man that can outsmart bullet
t1_dssz5rf	0.000000	*	You see, Americans ship freedom in 500/1000/2000 lb packages, while Russians ship hatred in 500/1000/2000 kg containers. It's all about units, mate!
t1_dsxk3g0	-0.273200	*	Yeah, comparing gulags to the american prison system, totally the same thing. Auschwitz and Rikers island are basically the same place.   You should glance more at history books.

t1_dtd6zon	-0.102700	*	Russian nationalists are just slavophiles with a hard on for Russian Orthodoxy and the House of Romanov last I checked.   They really don't have anything to say about Central Asians    
t1_dtw3m59	0.735100	*	Spoken like a true learned person. I have no words but respect.
t1_dspfm68	0.599400	*	Man they should have made a sequel to that movie. Loved it. 
t1_dt3zo26	-0.526700	*	Exactly. Business owners also assume risk while the worker can simply find a new job if shit hits the fan.
t1_dsvqbn9	0.361200	*	That's like saying that face recognition for surveillance is just maths - in the end it's just an algorithm running on some bytes, it's just maths, right? Application of maths is technology. 
t1_dsn0b7v	0.778300	*	And if he doesn't will you still think Mueller is around the corner? A lot of people said the same thing about his first year when will you give up hope lmao
t1_dshl194	0.000000	*	I cringed.
t1_dsxb3ty	0.000000	*	Did you mean the Black Sea? The Sea of Azov is right by Crimea

t1_dtfoxwy	0.153100	*	Its not nuanced, but Im confused as to what you are trying to say? There were definitely Muslims and Buddhists in that area 1000 years ago....
t1_dskm9ij	0.273200	*	Certain aspects of the man I do, other I don't . What is your point?
t1_dtsm66r	0.718400	*	Would you like to say where you hail from friend?

t1_dt92jd0	-0.361200	*	I doubt many wanted that many though.
t1_dslkzz3	0.457400	*	Yeah! Pretty damn small. Well I guess.  Sweden takes in 10x that. I believe. Or we did at least. Now we've cut down quite a lot on the immigration..   Norway is not in EU btw. Maybe you meant Europe? 
t1_dsydzmq	-0.442300	*	This is inaccurate. Autism doesnt prevent social bonds or empathy.  It causes an improper processing of signals, which can potentially cause empathy problems, but is not a guarantee of it. 
t1_dso4uqw	0.510600	*	My thoughts exactly. As I mentioned in other posts, it would also make sense for people of a certain religion to concentrate in areas where they have access to a place of worship.
t1_dslemj0	0.000000	*	Considering that you're on this website, apparently we do.
t1_dstqil9	0.401900	*	Is that a yes?
t1_dtgmlwk	-0.778300	*	It's the economy. The moment a recession hits or the stock market plummets, everything will change. While the unemployment rate is low and people's 401(k)s grow, there won't be unrest.

t1_dsh0upk	-0.401900	*	To my knowledge the franchise that started cutting the paid breaks is the franchise directly owned by the Horton-Royces. There is no franchisee middleman here it's as direct as it gets.

t1_dtoj7z7	-0.895700	*	>Ah because wearing a dress is the same as chopping up a local 18 year old.  Damn that whataboutism.  You do know there is a massive difference between a criminal and a terrorist correct?

t1_dsvsobn	0.440400	*	It truly is science. On every link of that chain, a human used science to bring it forth into the world. To me, that is FAR more wondrous. Nothing is given to us, we will it to be.
t1_dtfz4aj	-0.743000	*	The Dow Jones is up over 30% in his first year and black unemployment is at the lowest rate in recorded history. Yeah, things are just awful though because Trump is a meanie.

t1_dt9e3ok	0.784500	*	Is Bill Gates burdening himself? Seems like he still doing pretty well. Just imagine if all the others acted like he does.
t1_dsrj7uz	-0.051600	*	Afghan dogs knew us by our smell. They'd growl at locals and wag tails at us. Even the feral ones.  White people mean food... Afghans means they're going to get pelted with rocks.

t1_dt6prth	0.458800	*	They're really not.  Politics outside of the US is not usually anywhere near as polarised. Don't assume the rest of the world is as politically crippled :)
t1_dsh3qxt	-0.680800	*	Detroiter here. What the hell is a Quickchek?

t1_dszjsrr	0.286500	*	I'm not saying we shouldn't lobby the government over these issues. I'm saying that theres no point in not protesting the company as well.

t1_dtqmz60	0.101200	*	Considering many of the powerful Zoroastrian clerical families actually converted to Islam to keep their positions of power, I don't think that's a safe bet.
t1_dsv0375	0.381800	*	I stand corrected about the income tax amendment.  My mistake.  Taxes paid by immigrants played no part in their being successful or not.   Can't say more because I have to sign off for tonight.

t1_dskhyxl	0.916300	*	Yes, that doesn't contradict my comment. That's if you do good deeds in front of people to be seen by them. As in doing it for the praise rather than to help. 
t1_dsl6yyj	0.000000	*	And let them stay in sanctuary cities
t1_dsx6tdg	0.000000	*	Tartar. You mean Tartar.

t1_dtokllq	0.361200	*	Youre gonna get downvoted. Reddit is filled with people that are eager to defend communism. Its digusting.
t1_dsjy39u	-0.025800	*	Actually, you're completely right. She's simply too fucking unlikeable to receive fair treatment by the right-wing media, and she really only has herself to blame.
t1_dtpq3l4	0.897900	*	I believe when something is a natural monopoly government is best. If not then capitalism works best.
t1_dsq5bfx	0.000000	*	I think the media is the scum in this situation tbh.

t1_dtdm94z	0.273200	*	Well we were talking specifically about the last 20 years. 
t1_dtflop4	-0.129800	*	I fully agree.  We also have to keep in mind almost 50% of the people who voted in the recent election in Alabama voted for Roy Moore.  A man who thinks gay people should be locked up.  That's sick.
t1_dszut8z	-0.422800	*	Yo you're totally correct. The United States has so little gun crime compared to the rest of the world due to the 2nd ammendment.
t1_dsrtbds	-0.476700	*	Told my mate Kim to run a totalitarian state AND HE ACTUALLY DID IT WHAT A LAD
t1_dsgtckf	0.153100	*	Yeah, that's what I said. It's also irrelevant to the larger point but I guess that went over your head.
t1_dssjx3o	-0.624900	*	If werent overpaying by the billions on military equipment we could probably, in my opinion, afford to get intel on terrorists on our own 
t1_dsuz3mr	-0.837600	*	You ate it up. I remember you in particular were all over it and trying to slut shame everyone. Now you look dumb as rocks and are lashing out at /u/Daxoss, who did nothing wrong!
t1_dskhmtm	0.722000	*	Nice, but overpriced and a little too touristy for my taste.  Pop down the coast to Hondarribia, its much nicer imho!
t1_dt4see3	-0.371600	*	Yes that's assuming only literally the two areas I mentioned would be permitted, but I don't think it'll be that restricted.

t1_dsiu287	-0.648600	*	The lack of major wars between world powers is thanks to nuclear weapons.  The huge reduction in piracy, minor wars, skirmishes, etc are thanks to the US military.

t1_dsieahv	0.840200	*	Whether Putin has 30% approval or 90% approval - what's the difference?  Whether popular or unpopular, he is still a dictator. He isn't leaving power any time soon.

t1_dswm35c	-0.102700	*	America would probably pay off the entire Mexican military. If there is one thing that their military is, it is corrupt.

t1_dt363vn	-0.440400	*	Shit resources for people sure. Best resources to hide and train terrorists imo.  If you see it just as barking on twitter then you are not looking at the big picture.
t1_dtafbac	0.000000	*	Get up earlier
t1_dt98l6d	-0.177900	*	Not assuming. I'm taking his words seriously. He's said all he needs to to align himself with Erdogan.

t1_dsl54rw	0.419900	*	Serious question.  What have you done to aid those humanitarian efforts?  If your answer is I told everyone online how much I cared!  then you are exactly who they were talking about.
t1_dsddj6e	0.029400	*	Saying their is no evidence but Wink Wink it is true is nothing but conspiracy stuff. Which is dangerous and creates mistrust in the wrong places. You are doing a disservice to America.

t1_dssgkb4	-0.361200	*	Where the fuck are you finding these? I was prepping for a 1070/1080 purchase with my tax refund and the cheapest 1070Ti on Amazon clears $1k.

t1_dstbku7	0.476700	*	I think you are giving him too much credit.  Roy Moore is a huckster, not a holy man.  He likely doesn't believe in religion at all, beyond its utility to control the proles.  
t1_dt6cksr	0.292400	*	Hes not dead yet, hopefully he has many years left in him.
t1_dtaphiw	-0.548600	*	As an American who lives in Germany, I am so embarrassed by her. Sorry. 
t1_dsx1t6f	0.783200	*	I mean, it makes a bit of sense. It's pretty hypocritical to only ask for evidence for things you don't want to be true, and accept things you like with none

t1_dstjysd	0.493900	*	> choosing  That part is pretty key.
t1_dt6kp12	0.636900	*	I dont consider Trudeau to be competent in the least.   What exactly was incompetent about Harper ? That man was a rock. He didnt care about being famous. He cared about Canada.

t1_dtbljez	-0.664200	*	In the past there was a lot of stated income and no verification of anything which is why people today feel the process is so difficult.
t1_dtd4ku0	0.000000	*	But having that idea in your head in the background is going to make you come across as condescending, not just patronizing.

t1_dt9250l	0.921100	*	Trump isn't a fan of legalities. Unless it's laws that benefit him. Or individuals.  Pretty much: If it benefits Trump it's legal & good.  If it doesn't, if it isn't illegal it should be.
t1_dtpg5yy	0.585900	*	As a boy. According to a doctor I saw it counts as within the range of successful outcomes.   It is irreparable, except by foreskin restoration, and thats only a partial fix.

t1_dtcc42w	0.250000	*	Publicly financed elections with set budgets granted by the Federal Government is the way to go.  Force them to use actual speech as speech.

t1_dstlifu	0.000000	*	We would be aliens if we were on the other planet, but not while still on Earth.  The word alien is a relationship one has with the place they are, not a relationship between two people.

t1_dt90a5s	0.000000	*	They implied it was still on the books, which... considering how many monarchy related memes there are, sounded unlikely.
t1_dte9zvz	0.000000	*	duh, isn't it self-evident? the sanctions exist because not a single UNSC member vetoed them. including Russia.   in fact most if not all resolutions were unanimous.
t1_dskjw82	0.837800	*	So basically giving easy jobs to your friends, harder jobs to those who need to get their finger out.

t1_dsl10s1	0.000000	*	Ooh ooh check mine!
t1_dsm3e7h	-0.025800	*	Maybe there is some merit to having a clown for a president. Perhaps near the end, the masses will be humbled? :(

t1_dso42qv	0.000000	*	Don't take their troll bait. They are basically the lefts version of people from /r/the_donald
t1_dtlr92c	-0.526700	*	... and another difference is that Lance Armstrong's doping wasn't a massive state sponsored conspiracy.

t1_dsxtbmq	-0.781500	*	oh my, you really believe that dont you? seriously? I would start arguing but you are just trolling. Fighting fire with fire eh, the best way to combat trolls is to troll yourself.

t1_dtredz7	0.289000	*	I'm not 100% sure it's what you're talking about but could you mean Pocket God? I think that was on Facebook at some point
t1_dt9nayr	0.338400	*	It *did* work out quite well for Japan, historically speaking.
t1_dt3cr3n	0.659700	*	Yeah in the US we take a lot of our German words second hand from Yiddish, so the translation can vary.

t1_dtlzo4v	-0.401900	*	> The identity politics embraced by many on the left is the cancer, Trump was the inevitable response to that.  Possibly an explanation, but not a justification. 
t1_dtjjkz6	0.000000	*	They are right wing here, though. The commenter had that much right.
t1_dt4i6ys	0.842200	*	I'm 99% sure he wasn't Hasidim (maybe he was raised that way, but he definitely didn't practice the Ultra-Orthodox beliefs), but him being Jewish is indeed rather fitting. Good point.
t1_dt9n8wl	0.000000	*	He should not be able to, but you were not paying any attention to the political news during the last year if you don't see that he has been trying to do just that. 
t1_dsnvk8a	0.636900	*	Why do you think 4chan supported it, even better, t_d started off purely with memes
t1_dtq6fmt	-0.526700	*	No, i just mean, there's been no new information and they never had much to begin with.
t1_dta1zc5	-0.177900	*	I see this all the time. On what are you basing the assertion that a majority of cops overlook or hide corruption?
t1_dtlf7gx	0.361200	*	People are critical of the argument I'm happy with my circumcised penis so I'm going to do the same to my kid regardless of what benefits there are. 
t1_dtrgai0	-0.680800	*	Getting all of your news from reddit is going to give you a biased view. Redditors overall very much lean to the left.   Not saying being left is a bad thing, of course.
t1_dtt6aec	-0.557400	*	So you've found actual news huh? Well I guess that settles your initial question then. See, no bad double standards, both situations were represented in the media.
t1_dt0sgme	-0.967300	*	Death is really not important to me in terms of punishment, (edit:) because once your dead, your dead. Punishment can only be applied to living beings. 
t1_dsz2e4p	0.000000	*	And when Sandra Fluke decries not having 'access to birthcontrol' because someone won't buy it for her. It's always a word game and you're doing the same thing here.

t1_dsyct9j	-0.153100	*	Problem is many of those shops try too hard to be unique and price their coffee as high as Starbucks. It's hard to find an actual place that just gives you a cup of good coffee for a reasonable price.
t1_dsws6yg	0.309400	*	I didn't base it on age. If a fetus is removed straight away it doesn't have an age, does it?  How about answering my question. Are you against morning after pills?

t1_dts4wdy	0.475400	*	I think it's a bit of stretch to think that they were taking racial shots at her instead of referencing to the very popular saying 'drinking the kool-aid'.

t1_dtfeha9	-0.607000	*	All the above.  Not just Russians or whoever.    Probably the biggest problem with democracy here is that currently citizens arn't smart enough to formulate there own educated views.  
t1_dtv1sbe	-0.025800	*	Okay. I don't mean to say it's the majority. I'm saying even it's compared to weather alone.

t1_dsvmspz	-0.076200	*	I think this is what its about. They are being deported under the law, because they did not immigrate legally and were turned down for refugee status (economic migrants don't qualify as refugees).

t1_du3rp4k	0.000000	*	He can't. You know that alien that wears the man as a suit at the beginning of the MIB film? That's what Barnaby Joyce is: a body snatcher. You can see his real eyes under the skin suit eyes...
t1_dt80jf6	0.361200	*	Vatican City is the only country in the world where women can neither vote nor hold any kind of executive or legislative position. Catholicism is an inherently sexist ideology, like Islam.

t1_dtv2vl0	0.432900	*	Oh? So women can walk around bare-titted just like men?
t1_dtcr84h	-0.009400	*	That statistic also required all cities to be completely removed as well. It was crazy amounts of space and it was just for the US's animal agriculture too.
t1_dspv3fe	0.726900	*	Good argument, your beliefs surely have as much merit.
t1_dsl0kq3	0.000000	*	It's on the Amjerican continent. It counts!

t1_dshbpr7	-0.369500	*	No because they weren't advanced and their officer corps was terrible. Their tanks, aircraft and navy were trash.  Italian soldiers performed admirably under German officers.

t1_dt9x8mq	0.669600	*	Are technically acting against the law might be the best way to put it!
t1_dsm3r8s	0.705000	*	That is exactly what the people who support Trump want. America first. China can do their colonizing of Africa or whatever. Don't give a slightest fuck.
t1_dtihvji	-0.187400	*	Okay c'mon, he very clearly tried, it's not like the number of prisoners just magically went down over time on its own. Obviously there was some human intervention.

t1_dsnxeiy	0.520400	*	So we should privatize it all? The way you are looking at it is already flawed and simplified - what's a solution that will create zero waste that makes sense for shared services of a community?

t1_dsflz0i	0.000000	*	Possibly I misspoke.
t1_dskyemw	-0.718400	*	From the perspective of having your senior management and leadership team suffer from the same turnover rate as a minimum-wage bargain basement retailer, that's a massive failure. 
t1_dsl25oh	0.296000	*	Yep, just read that after someone else mentioned it.  The Post should update their story.
t1_dt0pkrv	-0.612400	*	Thats all you have to say? You cant refute it. You know that the Turkish government banned the use of their language, clothing and entire culture and thats why they rebelled.

t1_dtatp68	-0.250000	*	But hypothetically they could if we required a retooling to a war economy tomorrow.  It's good to have that kind of know how in a domestic economy.

t1_dt9vaxw	-0.887600	*	Usually you have to demonstrate harm for defamation. I think you'll find it extremely rare someone suffered for being called a bastard or a nazi. 
t1_dt8y81x	-0.616900	*	You don't have a constitutional right to access the Internet.  Removing Net Neutrality isn't giving the government more power to regulate and censor the Internet.

t1_dsk53ro	-0.168000	*	If the current system isn't rational why is it worth being legalistic about it? Why spend public money deporting people for no reason?

t1_dtoyp85	0.492600	*	Haha, if that's real that's so fucking pathetic. Im sure they could've found some better material. Their credibility just fell in my eyes.

t1_dtuhrr1	0.578900	*	Unfortunately it is seen by many as a legitimate news outlet, but it's mainly 'middle England', mostly older people who don't access alternative news media... Luckily they are a dying breed...

t1_dsn07wt	0.000000	*	Frankly, I don't see any need to label it. It's a constitution, it's our constitution, and that's all that needs to be said.
t1_dt6o8mk	0.771700	*	That's just human nature.   Everybody who isn't autistic does their best to fit in.

t1_dsjb9x5	-0.731100	*	There are some problems that needs to be dealt with but that was to be expected. But the fantasy that Europe is on the brink of collapse is something the right wing sector dreamed up.

t1_dsv4bvq	-0.361200	*	How about further rules on discourse: require acceptable sources, must be productive, 3 strike rules, etc. Also it would be one liar versus the world.

t1_dt9d5q0	0.660500	*	If you still support him then that must mean that you are at least somewhat ok with his performance so far. What are his top achievements from a conservative pov?

t1_dta1uh9	-0.226300	*	Yeah because her being a professor in something ending in studies makes her by definition subpar. And her book? Even a broken clock is right twice a day. 
t1_dtbz5uq	0.493900	*	Uh....yes it's scientifically proven. We don't have enough brain capacity to care about the entire human race.
t1_dsj1r0r	-0.305000	*	I'm really not sure what point you're trying to make there.
t1_dta206i	0.734600	*	Very interesting, do the neighbourhoods which use the most happen to be the wealthiest with the largest lawns etc?

t1_dsowdna	-0.332400	*	Really?  Okay. Guess we should just disband our military and give up the 2nd amendment.  WW2 was enough to convince the world that wars are not worth it anymore!

t1_dtclr1l	-0.579900	*	Drugs and guns are different, though. Guns aren't addictive, guns are much more dangerous as weapons, and drugs are easier to conceal.

t1_dtjpohc	0.224700	*	In Christian nations it was only really popular in the US. It topped at 35% of the population in the UK. It was never necessary. It was literally done to stop masturbation.
t1_dswl3y0	0.177900	*	Agreed. This doesn't rectify the urest we're feeling from a botched voter-reform promise, but it sure helps to distract us from the major failings (half-goods) of Trudeau.

t1_dt7aobi	0.000000	*	You're right. People often don't think about the cost it would take to bring the North into the fold. It would take billions maybe even trillions to bring the North to the same level as the South.
t1_dszz7nb	-0.829400	*	Same thing for mobsters here, didnt stop the FBI from breaking their back. Not saying Im in favor of the mafia but when you take out a central organization all chaos breaks loose.

t1_dsha0kc	-0.377400	*	>  it doesn't mean it's still not being used by americans as an excuse an escapegoat to avoid taking self responsability.  Well I am not using it that way so go whine at somebody else.

t1_dsk5dm9	-0.412500	*	No, it doesn't. The part where I said Pearl Harbor happened while we were not at war with Japan is correct. That made the Pearl Harbor victims, like the ones from Bataan Death March.

t1_dt4gdqx	0.542300	*	It sounded pretty defensive to me, but I could be wrong. He threw the I know you are, but what am I comment back into the face of the person he responded to like a three year old throwing a fit.

t1_dt8d6iv	-0.907800	*	Why are abortions terrible, because you're murdering babies?  Murdering babies is okay if mothers don't want them?  Early stage fetuses are not sentient so it's not an issue of morality.

t1_dt8u1vv	0.851600	*	I prefer Joxe3o Amoedo, but that's because of my liberal views. So it's up to you know if she is better or least worst than the others.

t1_dtrhkji	0.440400	*	Is it not? It averages out to around 500 people per country so some countries may have only a couple hundred responses. Surely that cant be enough
t1_dt4xaj1	0.211100	*	You get your own back by winning World Cups though. Our national team is rubbish because we don't have enough home grown talent any more - and virtually no managers :(

t1_dt87du9	0.273200	*	There's a certain value in a state having them though. It staves off bullying from opposed nations. Remember the year ghaddafi signed the deal that assured their nuclear disarmament?

t1_dtm3i6p	0.361200	*	Thank you for saying what I would have said. It would have taken me quite a bit of time, just as I presume it did for you.
t1_dt39vrz	0.632600	*	Huge fucking difference between a comedian on a sketch show and the POTUS.  Especially in this case, where he was supposedly imitating a head of state.

t1_dt9776z	0.399900	*	> Israel will never agree to that, it would mean giving up on the idea of a Jewish state.  Sometimes giving up on a *very bad* idea (like Zionism) is a very *good* idea.    
t1_dslik8y	0.235400	*	But Trump supporters are Republicans, who are less likely to be unemployed. Your point doesn't make any sense and is not supported by facts.

t1_dt1ceek	0.318200	*	To be fair, the British did that in London first...
t1_dte3yuk	0.421500	*	That's ironic, as the word martyr was invented at the time when all societies were authoritarian. Do you think the Roman Emperors believed in free press as they fed Christians to the lions?

t1_dtw8c8e	0.000000	*	Gotcha. I was aware of that, I just didn't know that you meant 'less sunlight' when you were talking about colder climates. Makes sense now though.
t1_dt2iuzt	0.000000	*	I assume that's why Masters and Post Doc degrees have thesises and stuff that you have to defend?

t1_dtsqdy6	-0.458800	*	Russian citizens think every information forced on them to be propoganda, be it state or foreign media. But 'our' propoganda is much more tolerable simply because it is *our* propoganda.

t1_dshouck	0.214400	*	How I wish more people understood economics and artificial wage controls.   They always backfire but are dressed in the cloak of fairness and a living wage

t1_dtfijl0	0.000000	*	Not subjective; check a dictionary. And you know it... That's why you deflected and didn't answer my question.
t1_dt9a6ky	-0.718400	*	Just a fundamental misunderstanding of the topic... did you read that article? It covers radiation illnesses. 
t1_dtm2axz	0.128000	*	Same here in the Philippines, other than me a lot of my neighbors, friends and family members also got the flu starting from the 2nd week of january up to last week.
t1_dtp26nv	0.709600	*	In America non-profit just means there is no profit for shareholders. Profit for the CEO? Sure.

t1_dsjjwtc	0.000000	*	From my research as I am currently looking at applying at unis in the UK there are different fees for EU students and ones from outside. This is looking at high end universities

t1_dtu4yjz	-0.296000	*	There was before something called a rebalancing in prior administrations, not in this one. No turning to the Center.

t1_dtotxws	-0.341200	*	He's most probably done both. He knows this road leads nowhere good and is likely doing all he can to minimise the consequences for himself. 
t1_dsm1yzx	0.220100	*	It's not offensive until it's inevitably following up question, haha, no, where are you *really* from? which is designed to imply that non-white people are not and can never be truly American.
t1_dsk7lo2	0.077200	*	Try to learn something while you're there, so you don't continue to be a piece of trash excuse of a human.
t1_dtafvnm	0.273200	*	I've met a lot of dumb smart people in my life. Being educated doesn't necessarily make someone smart.

t1_dskt5q6	0.199900	*	Yawn. Whatever, what he's doing is still unprecedented in magnitude and impact. If you don't like it, vote for someone else next time. Easy.
t1_dsfgqxt	0.903800	*	Theres a difference between wanting to win for competition's sake and wanting to win to actually perform the duties. Trump absolutely wanted to win, he just didn't want the job.

t1_dsxn7qu	-0.470800	*	You are making all kinds of unwarranted assumptions.  Why are you disaster-mongering?  It's like you WANT this to be bad thing. And that's just terrible.

t1_dtr9is7	0.361200	*	That would be relying on you NOT to do something.  Which is the opposite of what I said.  Few jurisdictions impose a legal duty to act to save someone else's life.

t1_dsq602y	-0.131600	*	Torches!? How dare you say that word. You don't want to incite the white. *sarcasm - because we have to say that now* 
t1_dsy7tr4	0.000000	*	They trespassed across the border with Egypt until Israel built a fence. Now they're being sent back.
t1_dsx49g4	0.735100	*	 It's not a need to feel superior. That person is delivering incorrect facts. It is 100% incorrect to claim they're as smart as humans. 
t1_dttxlst	0.709600	*	Honestly you are doing better than me, because I wrote that comment on a phone made by a Chinese 10 year old. 
t1_dt4z3lh	0.025800	*	I know, I was agreeing on the absurdity of it all.  They use isolated incidents to make broad sweeping generalizations, then get all pissy when the same is done to them.
t1_dtal6k7	0.636900	*	Yeah I noticed :)
t1_dtmipsc	0.000000	*	But nobodys living there.  Why would I ask the French for a permit?
t1_dsjl3oa	0.250000	*	The UK has spent millions to capture him... Scoring brownie point with Trump by arresting and deporting an annoying asshole seems like a no brainer to me. What has the UK to gain from letting him go?
t1_dtwt64o	0.855500	*	Sure. Better than limiting the freedom of bodily autonomy of adults in the name of protecting people from themselves.
t1_dsw66lv	0.000000	*	The Ivory V
t1_dsjzpnf	0.000000	*	Ooh see he didn't say that though, did he? 
t1_dsmqpol	0.025800	*	You'll have the pleasure of knowing that someone will eventually step on your shit on their way to work. 
t1_dtoq6at	0.000000	*	dont let 4chan find out about that last part.  
t1_dtrw39e	0.718400	*	I like my women like I like my coffee: black, bitter, and preferably fair trade. 
t1_dspi21s	0.526700	*	You make it sound like that's way outside the norm.  In most U.S. states age of consent is 16 or 17.
t1_dsyzzvr	0.440400	*	Idk what tbis comment means. We dont have anything close to a free market.
t1_dsi8qjp	0.000000	*	He did Men instead 
t1_dsy3rs1	-0.553100	*	The buy any other phone on the market besides apple. Nobody us forcing you to buy their newest phone. They market to the majority. Not you. So stop complaining. 
t1_dtkhgo0	0.960300	*	I hope in a good way. XD they cudded me and did tricks and loved me like a dog or cat would, so they deserved the same respect imo.
t1_dsf0l5m	-0.473100	*	How about we just agree sarcasm has no place in the news subs? Saying the opposite of what you mean isn't clever and doesn't add anything to the discussion. 
t1_dt1ls9y	0.000000	*	Except those are three different headlines. 
t1_dtkgh4m	0.000000	*	Educate thyself before voicing thy theories.
t1_dtaa77u	-0.493900	*	That's an unfair not-wholly-accurate generalization.  We're pretty dumb at home too.
t1_dsflo84	0.000000	*	...JF?
t1_dtna4c3	0.361200	*	Oh my, an honest-to-goodness [Sea Lioning](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/873/260/a5b.png). I never thought I'd see one in the wild. Thank you for the experience.
t1_dto6owx	0.458800	*	For those who don't remember? I think you're vastly overestimating the age of your fellow Redditors. :)
t1_dt3hees	0.361200	*	Did u read that? Seems like ur beef is with the ancient Romans
t1_dtabnxy	0.915100	*	Ha! Though she's right. First time I saw the Milky Way was near Langdale, and it truly did take my breath away.  But then to be fair, you're right too. Good luck shaving her feet.
t1_dtksgyo	0.250000	*	Oh weird, the video didn't load on the page for me. Interesting.
t1_dt9cgnl	0.624900	*	Good call, I only follow news sources that are unbiased and fair when reporting the latest Thomas The Tank Engine news.

t1_dtab6ck	0.000000	*	Danny Rand? 
t1_dsz1w0t	-0.458800	*	Most of those 7% were not by choice either. The individual mandate forced them on
t1_dsy4bks	0.000000	*	That's about 1 dollar too high.
t1_dtpr3dm	-0.509600	*	Didn't the founder of reddit use someone's song in a video without paying royalties? Great example to set to us all.
t1_dt4gp7t	0.624900	*	Huh, sounds like a serious wolf issue.  Better double it to 2 donkeys.  Twice the not fucking around.
t1_dsjvtgj	0.401900	*	Hopefully that's what [this lawsuit](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4346469-12018-01-09-Complaint-Filed-Legal-8031957-1-4.html) will do.
t1_dt3oala	0.510600	*	That's always a possibility. Luckily, I live in germany.
t1_dtv8274	0.000000	*	Adding to the other guy the UK is still in the EU
t1_dsmk1ok	-0.492700	*	So weak.
t1_dtk9obe	0.000000	*	For me it would be ...
t1_dsp25qj	0.000000	*	It can be either.
t1_dt3k74e	0.145800	*	So incompetent he won over 5 states that historically vote Democrat
t1_dts08t2	-0.077200	*	20k was enough to pay off multiple student loans, a car, and credit card debt?

t1_dsk7283	-0.750600	*	Well no food and material supply... Not to forget the fallout. Might survive the first strikes but the outcome might be even worse.
t1_dsld0y8	-0.933100	*	Legal immigration is fine, but if we just let people in without the actual process, it is breaking the law, and here should be no question about illegal immigrants. They are ILLEGAL
t1_dsh9jts	0.000000	*	Pot. Kettle. Black.
t1_dsomet2	0.000000	*	Hmmm. I have you labeled as a trump voter...nah, *just* a coincidence.

t1_dtoayds	0.361200	*	 Gold, sir/madam. Pure internet gold is what you've got here.   I like Canadieu. Gotta get that French in
t1_dt4pyjr	0.669600	*	Vigilantism never sounded so honorable.
t1_dtdb4f6	0.000000	*	So allegations and anonymous sources now equal factual information?  I did wonder what they meant by saying post-fact.
t1_dt2cmt4	0.000000	*	Thats not how any of this works. A backup NFL QB doesnt work 1000 times harder than a minimum wage worker either. 
t1_dt9dz5r	0.202300	*	No need, it's obvious you're going to try to   >start using whataboutism/deflection.  Instead of addressing a senior Israeli minister smiling along side chants for genocide.... 
t1_dsvxodf	-0.757900	*	No one would die if there was no drone. So it is not callous to say that your coat benefit analysis makes no sense.
t1_dt9etlm	0.585900	*	Brilliant non-point. Carry on with your babbling.
t1_dtrjc3z	0.000000	*	>And yet you did it anyway.  That was a different person.
t1_dt3u6tf	-0.636900	*	No one's thinking China is being nice. A loan is a loan; it needs to be paid. What's wrong though is /u/Vordeo's defeatist attitude. He already think Philippines will default on the loan.
t1_dto9mom	0.153100	*	Yeah, but why do through the effort for some random website?
t1_dt7d23o	-0.851900	*	That and I cant really see KJ Un (dos.. tres.. hehe) willingly giving up power.  Hell be like  *Yeah we reunified so that can rule you guys too wtf is with this democracy bullshit guys*
t1_dtbiza4	-0.526700	*	Youre stupid.
t1_dsdlfmv	0.401900	*	I'm from the UK and I wish the vote hadn't happened. Not on the terms it did anyway.

t1_dstapl9	-0.128000	*	Thankfully they're dumb.
t1_dt3axks	-0.177900	*	Because if those people stay in Sudan, they will die. They belong in Israel because itself will save their lives. 
t1_dshpijm	0.202300	*	> We're called Liberals. You may have heard of us.   Right, you're the ones who refuse to show up to vote unless your absolute favorite person in the entire world is running.
t1_dtm1nb1	0.119000	*	I got it last week. I'm cured except for a cough and a fatigue I just can't shake. It sucks. I want to go back to normal, but I have a cloudiness to my thoughts when I'm up and about.
t1_dsofwv1	0.476700	*	Yeah okay. Why don't you go back to confirming whether we live on a flat disk and Antarctica is just a giant wall or something?
t1_dt182gr	0.419900	*	comment edited and a thank you to you in the comment!
t1_dt1arp1	0.000000	*	Uh... do I up or down vote you? Reddit tell me what to do!!
t1_dsp7bfz	0.000000	*	Tru
t1_dtn2j3b	-0.342100	*	I see I hurt your feelings, because I dont agree with you. I'm not downvoting you, beacuse I respect what you have to say.
t1_dtvpeqb	-0.440400	*	Suck my downvotes mothafucka
t1_dsl00bo	-0.250000	*	I think the those on the left continually inserting race, feminism, etc into every topic is equally divisive. Not that he isn't, just you only ever hear that accusation thrown at him.
t1_dsm3qiz	0.498800	*	Yeah, mate, but normally developed countries compare themselves with each other, not oh well at least it's better than the third world.
t1_dt5lfbk	-0.275500	*	All countries can't do that.   Natural resource deposits aren't evenly distributed. 
t1_dtoe4l7	0.585900	*	Vamoose was brilliant.
t1_dtb79gl	-0.778300	*	> To answer the implied question  Im glad you understand why eyes roll when people go out of their way to defend such vile people.  Thought crime or no.
t1_dsl5hkc	0.636900	*	That was a slick move by Durbin, praising Graham for speaking up against it. Graham would have had to deny he ever said anything himself if he wanted to stay Trumps loyal butt buddy.
t1_dsosycz	-0.051600	*	Fair enough. Difficult to tell sometimes.
t1_dt9brsq	-0.669700	*	Even some leadership for the Tea Party hated him (Rand Paul really dislikes Trump)

t1_dtkg1ah	0.401900	*	Yes. U0001f609
t1_dtszyhi	0.778300	*	Yes, ten cents here, ten cents there, each for a 'great cause'.  On the other side of the world.  For what?  Posterity.  That's what.  
t1_dtcmfui	0.182200	*	It attempts to, but drugs are quite a bit easier to smuggle than guns. Especially when the drug can be produced within Britain.
t1_dt7gxx5	0.711700	*	It is not. I shit you not (at least in my experience) everyone I've asked either says what? or my personal favorite minor skirmish 
t1_dtwikgj	0.470700	*	Don't forget Timur decimating the Delhi Sultanate, that's an event that shook faith.
t1_dtci1nc	-0.318200	*	Wtf dude you want foreign influencers on American media? Twitter and other American media are subject to laws. It's ok your demagogue will be gone soon
t1_dsif6oy	0.000000	*	It was just in the news, the troll army gets trippled. Possibly due to incoming sport events.

t1_dsf6lnp	0.000000	*	Google are far more relevant to international affairs unless Trump has actually done something (tweeting even more garbage doesn't count).
t1_dsi48wg	0.000000	*	Hows that boot taste?
t1_dsrrcws	0.886900	*	Yeah, i think he's a piece of shit but he clearly doesn't want to die lol

t1_dsqxkz8	0.361200	*	They're like bed roaches.
t1_dshezzn	-0.524200	*	No Im not. It is important to discern between the two. Im not being an asshole. There is a very important distinction between wanting and passive occurrence.
t1_dt4zp8u	-0.862500	*	You've given a terrible example.  Being bad doesn't mean it shouldn't be distributed. Otherwise all those extra Police Academy films would have been banned.
t1_dtp8sde	0.000000	*	Many anglosphere countries use this term. America isn't the centre of the universe. 
t1_dtl4ngj	-0.190100	*	Yeah, but money. And shareholders. Never forget the shareholders. This is all for them.
t1_dt6wu46	0.000000	*	That might still be preferable to the current situation, though.

t1_dtm377s	-0.361200	*	Would you use the same argument for nazis?
t1_dtqs4vx	-0.864500	*	Your overly dramatic buffoon Canada owes them nothing, it is not responsible for them. It is suicidal and idiotic to compromise the integrity of the vessel because of some hysterical guilt trip.
t1_dsw40l7	-0.557400	*	> im a piece of shit  Not yet.  But soon.
t1_dtqmpwl	0.000000	*	I mean the RNC, as a whole, refuses to put anything affirming LGBT equality in their platform, and they keep running anti-lgbt candidates. So I think it can be attributed to the right, as a whole. 
t1_dtraglv	0.000000	*	Why did you say the same thing twice?
t1_dsx9vfk	0.458800	*	If this is how we're measuring intelligence I guess I'm pretty dumb.

t1_dsgz74c	0.493900	*	Friend in Canada has mentioned how decent quality his McDonalds is up there  Meanwhile, I've been to ones where there are more flies than fries here in the US. So it probably varies a lot.

t1_dsqe0f0	0.401900	*	I think less than 1% or 0.8% is kind of proving my point. They mostly help themselves, beyond that not so much.

t1_dsfut0z	0.585900	*	Why do they have to win in someone's eyes?

t1_dsqo1z4	-0.754300	*	You tell me. You're the one that was pimping it like it was next level awesome. I know the job sucks, but I'm not trying to hoc a narrative that they bitch for no reason unlike some folks.
t1_dsqvybv	0.401900	*	Yes. More so the box spring. 
t1_dtoffkf	0.361200	*	Like they don't already?
t1_dt22y4o	0.296000	*	Yeah
t1_dtid1jx	-0.278700	*	Its not a choice. If NK doesn't have nukes 50 million will die to the US.   They're not stupid.
t1_dtosef4	0.318200	*	Ah, fair enough
t1_dtbvc1n	-0.440400	*	Seriously what point are you trying to make? It was a war. The story is interesting.
t1_dtehors	0.128000	*	A crackdown on corruption in Russia just led to an increase in the cost of a bribe. 
t1_dsh6680	0.571900	*	Governments will always find a way to manipulate their currency. They used to shave and dilute back when currency was precious metal, and they'd find a way to do that with cryptocurrency. 
t1_dthhb9u	-0.102700	*	Innocent until proven guilty now means pedantic. What a world we live in.
t1_dszoj7r	0.680800	*	Yup, but that like 1/3rd of the world ;)
t1_dsgmqx0	0.250000	*	Not exactly bad, but it is an archaic translation . Like in Tennyson's Ulysses  > I am become a name; For always roaming with a hungry heart Much have I seen and known  cities of men ...   
t1_dta9140	0.000000	*	This blows my mind.. 
t1_dst686l	0.000000	*	[I think you are talking about this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY96hTb8WgI)
t1_dt8p64b	0.318200	*	Could you repeat that, please?
t1_dspm4yv	-0.077200	*	His wording made me visualize the trucks just petering out sadly three quarters of the way there, like the Colorado river.
t1_dsr3ci5	0.361200	*	Yellow Dust isn't an issue in California like it is in Beijing or Korea, either. 
t1_dtas8qg	0.785600	*	I agree, but basically it seems like they got a softball contract because they're the local guys and they're fully taking advantage of that.
t1_dsttlk1	-0.862500	*	I mean they're gonna bitch. There are likely SK who hate the north. Even if the North will probably not make up a line. And they will only cut 4th liners.
t1_dt9wem8	0.000000	*	Youre so *articulate!*
t1_dspj1dn	0.000000	*	TAK is a subset of PKK.
t1_dslvqtl	-0.659700	*	Dude, people take things because they can. We're a fucked up species.
t1_dt9e3bo	-0.670500	*	You underestimate partisanship.  Mueller could literally get a video tape of Trump sucking Putin's dick in exchange for Hillary emails and this congress STILL wouldn't remove him from office.
t1_dtaygsl	0.000000	*	Because they can most afford it, i.e. a p progressive tax.
t1_dt4lzlk	0.104500	*	I do not know what you mean, unless you mean that competing with children makes our labor less competitive. We, after all, got rid of child labor close to a century ago.
t1_dskuwpf	-0.571900	*	Loads of people in Europe hate muslims too.
t1_dsm1qf9	0.000000	*	He might be fucking with you.
