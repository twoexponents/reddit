t1_du1xr8j	1	*	If someone denies feformation than fine, but they should at least get the chance.
t1_dtaemgi	1	*	Considering Canadian taxpayer money just went to Airbus jobs in Mobile Alabama as part of the Bombardier-Boeing fallout, I'm thinking the US is fine with their relationship with Canada. 
t1_dtc8wzv	1	*	Those aren't subsidies, those are contracts for aircraft.  Boeing has to pay for the development of its platforms, Airbus and Bombardier do not.
t1_dtblbc7	0	*	The Liberal party would do anything for Bombardier. They continually bail that company out with public funds. 
t1_dtczljv	0	*	https://globalnews.ca/news/3773916/bombardier-boeing-subsidies/
t1_dtbui7r	1	*	Well Bombardier also profit more of it than if it was alone. Marketing power of Airbus is way higher than Bombardiers one. Which xe9manant they are most likely to sell more planes.
t1_dtbq1me	0	*	I think you got it all wrong with Airbus.
t1_dtapzus	1	*	There's a difference between remaining neutral and going We can't give you copies of those documents. We forgot to unpack them when we moved office & can't be arsed to do it now.
t1_dtb00qp	1	*	And I don't think that should happen either.
t1_duhkx6o	1	*	Just pointing out Isreal is not the only country to do so. I agree it's not the norm though. I wish my country would do the same... would be alot of politics behind bars.

t1_dtlo68u	0	*	So? Keeping them illegal clearly isn't working. It's time for a different approach. 
t1_dtlxb4w	0	*	As a tax payer, that would piss me the fuck off. I don't mind legalizing it so they can get legit stuff, but why in the hell do I have to pay for it?
t1_dtltndm	1	*	LOL at reporting to police, police are slower than snails even if they cared

t1_dtm1cnz	1	*	OK CHILL :P
t1_dtmrl0t	0	*	I mean that's true with alcohol too. .08 isn't going to impair a severe alcoholic 
t1_dtlkmzh	1	*	I don't think it makes that much of a difference from driving drunk tbh.
t1_dtlocqj	1	*	And provide better education about drugs w/o blatant scare tactics. Just facts
t1_dtlji95	0	*	She's obviously not a cop
t1_dtlnwae	1	*	Just don't. Its really not worth it. 
t1_dtl8mlb	0	*	I think it doesn't make huge difference because otherwise people would vote for some to end war on drugs.
t1_dtlezg5	1	*	Thanks for giving me greater picture!
t1_dtlq75c	0	*	BE is democratic socialist party, they aren't in any way communists 
t1_dtlwfei	1	*	I was in Portugal two years ago, and you couldn't buy marijuana any more than you could in any prohibited country.  But there would be no criminal penalties for possession.   
t1_dtmhd83	1	*	Nah in Portugal that would mean corruption. We are kind of big experts in corruption
t1_dt1rh19	1	*	This isn't a zero sum game.

t1_dubu2ue	0	*	Aww that 40 year old repost again?
t1_duc3mld	1	*	When would they train?  It would be much cheaper to just employ tree-planting companies. Soldiers cost a fortune.
t1_ducfnha	1	*	TIL thanks!

t1_dselan3	1	*	I've been waiting for a #2 moment since before the election, but it's all been a load of number 2 so far. 
t1_dsfk8ly	0	*	This is reddit. Everything is Trumps fault. Except for good things like talks between NK and SK. Thats not a result of Trump.   /s
t1_dsf4ir9	0	*	No, because US wanted absolutely nothing to do with that war until Japan forced us to get involved in it.  That war was entirely about Europe and Japan shitting on the world as hard as possible.

t1_dtogz94	1	*	I watched the whole series and it really opened my eyes 
t1_dtoyf83	1	*	I was considering the 2018 VW Tiguan or the 2018 Chevy Equinox. 
t1_dsrfb81	1	*	Smallpox contributed to it though. Considering that it killed 5-8 million and that a few decades later the population was so small that 15 million already contributed to 80% of it.
t1_dsl7v0k	0	*	russian tanks are not settlers   edit: at least russian were direct . Israelis keep on saying they want a peace agreement, while funding settlers all over west bank. this is highly hypocritical.
t1_dszyt6q	0	*	Any proof on that? 
t1_dt0ldzy	1	*	I'm more referring to the numerous other communist regimes, especially the large ones. Perhaps it will work in a smaller country such as Nepal, and I certainly hope it will.

t1_dv19vvc	1	*	Kinda in some places, but they Arm people like Hamas and that causes conflict, and they don't take action during scenarios like Yemen

t1_dum2jdr	0	*	Thats because you live in the USA.
t1_dulq8yg	1	*	How the fuck is this getting downvoted? Your asking for evidence and the OP hasn't provided any even his article goes against his talking points. 
t1_dulpi8t	1	*	People forget that Obama did the exact same shit 
t1_dulm1pq	0	*	And I'll say why are you continually conflating illegal immigration with asylum seeking?
t1_dulihdr	0	*	Once you get to fucking Europe tho youre no longer a refugee and shouldnt be given any special treatment. I mean come on, Afghanistan isnt even close to Germany/Sweden/Norway/Finland/Denmark.
t1_dulht5q	1	*	As long as you're openly bigoted, that's cool. I mean, at least then you can't get angry at the handful of refugees who actually DO want to kill you as well. You all actually agree, after all.
t1_dulv5qj	1	*	That's literally how most first world societies work. Everyone pays taxes, and those taxes are often used to pay for things that don't benefit everyone (or are someone else's bullshit).

t1_dsq7bd8	1	*	Mate come on, people can't say such things without a source. Surely as a Trump supporter you must know how important it is to combat fake news.
t1_dsq4gvc	0	*	I'm not saying she's not responsible, just that we should wait until the facts come out before we can ascribe motivation to what happened 
t1_duix7m9	0	*	Tim Hortons gift certificates for anyone who may have once been a baby. 
t1_dt0c5td	1	*	400million people in the united states these protest might look massive but in reality, they are a small fragment of the female population and shouldn't be considered a representative of all women.

t1_dup1pc0	0	*	Dude it's been 4 years. 300 dead civilians is nothing. Every single day more civilians die in the wars around the world. It would be hypocritical to cover mh17 and not forget already.

t1_dtxvvtg	1	*	Well it is kurdistan 24, who were shut down by the iraqi government for inciting hate and violence. . .    So we kinda expect people to act like the person your replying to.    
t1_dtxvegt	1	*	To be fair Iran is keeping F-14's and AH-1's in the air somehow. If anyone was going to be able to maintain these it would be them.
t1_dtxprxe	1	*	Yes...

t1_du124sy	0	*	The article doesn't say anyhing about above whose soil the plane was hit, just that it crashed in Northern Israel. Are you making up 'facts'?
t1_dujl20r	0	*	Yes. Escalating the harshness of the reports for the 20th time will sure make people realize the scope of tragedy.
t1_dukmhvv	0	*	I doubt very much it is only the Russian agenda trying to keep this from mainstream news.    Not one US media organization has reported on the pipeline in Syria. 
t1_duk4kex	0	*	Yeah, you don't see the US or Russia getting involved in all the civil wars that have been going on in africa for hundreds of years, cause they have nothing worth exploiting to those powers.
t1_dv5n470	0	*	They've spent several million dollars on these efforts year after year. If nothing else, Russia appears to believe that these efforts are having a significant effect.

t1_ds6e2ib	0	*	Well, I guess you could say it's a case of History teaching us not to trust Pakistan
t1_ds6ba7f	1	*	That's not true, though.  It's a myth. 
t1_ds6feq5	1	*	Honestly we're witnessing is the geopolitical equivalent of two couples breaking up and airing their dirty laundry.  It's wise not to take anything you hear online or on media at face-value.
t1_ds6l6ol	0	*	Pakistan created and continues to fund most of these groups along with the KSA. Pakistan has been overtly hostile to the US for decades.
t1_ds6ozkv	0	*	What about the intervening decade in which they hid him and his ilk?

t1_dt2twys	1	*	If you think Bill gates makes computers you probably shouldn't.
t1_dsvbl2w	1	*	No, there is no line based on population. For instance, stripping a population of its culture is genocide, even if they no one is killed, they thrive, and their population explodes.

t1_dtiy88c	0	*	Puerto Ricans don't pay federal taxes... because they have no voting power in congress or ability to select the head of the federal (that is, their democratically elected) government. 
t1_dthwzy2	1	*	Not if you live in D.C.
t1_dtilrud	0	*	Thanks Trump!
t1_du1935p	0	*	What about a video?  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0Jt_Vy4Mj0
t1_du1d02k	0	*	Actually Iron Dome CAN be used to down drones and has done so in the past.  I was unaware this particular drone was downed by a helicopter. Makes sense. Thanks!
t1_du125b8	0	*	Depends on what they managed to bomb in Syria. 
t1_du11yte	0	*	Iranian drones weren't invited into Israel though, which is why the Israeli Air Force went into Syria - to target the location the drones came from.
t1_dt4rll6	0	*	So basically a way of tracking everyones everything all the time with a decentrilised computer network? A governments dream right
t1_dub7opd	1	*	I feel its the new wake up sheeple where as soon as I hear it, I just assume whatever youre saying was gotten off of a YouTube video with shitty text-to-speak narration over pictures of **PROOF**
t1_dtpfg2i	1	*	Remember during the debates- hearing him talk with no details just vague *feely* statements like this- and thinking *'no way anybody is eating this shit up.'* 
t1_dtnv1et	1	*	Available exclusively at The Sharper Image!
t1_dtnzpdg	0	*	We're going to win bigly. For sure.
t1_dto206l	0	*	Have you considered doing business with the Canadian mafia?
t1_dto1dy0	1	*	Honestly I would not take his word on anything to consider him anti-anything.  He only seems consistent on being anti-muslim and pro-russia
t1_dtnzcvl	0	*	I believe they are referring to the little known act of compromise. Where neither side comes first and everyone both wins and loses in some regard, for the greater good.   Edit: A word
t1_dto13p6	0	*	Scary thing is, pence was going to lose the governors race in Indiana AS AN INCUMBENT. He was despised in his own state. And hes one impeachment from being president.
t1_dto4uvh	1	*	Yes, but we live in A-M-E-R-I-C-A.
t1_dto2iuy	1	*	This might be the most liberal comment Ive ever seen
t1_dtoaadi	0	*	Harper was Bush lite.
t1_dtnsuwc	0	*	He did inherit a good country...
t1_dtow5ma	1	*	I expect Trump prefers people to bend over forwards.
t1_dtplwx2	0	*	And Edison took over 1,000 attempts to create the light bulb. Whats your point? 
t1_dtonwvv	1	*	And you think China will give Canada a good deal?
t1_dto2gfe	1	*	He is a coward.  He refuses to visit countries where he may be heckled.  Trump basically chooses to live in one big safe space, and never leaves.
t1_dto7nob	0	*	Oh he'll sell you a car. At 19k. They love poor negotiators that think they are good. 
t1_dtnxxnu	0	*	Really? I think he's handling them well as well. Yes he's a hipster doofus but the fact he's even doing these speaks to me. 
t1_dtnzdn6	0	*	Huh?
t1_dto2nji	1	*	It's not the only market though. Which is what Trump fails to understand.
t1_dtnzh4l	0	*	You're right he's said a lot of things, but his only consistent point has been NAFTA killed American manufacturing, that's why he's willing to drop it.   It didn't, robots did.   
t1_dtnyxm0	1	*	If he had put all of his money into the S&P500 when he inherited it, he'd be richer than he is right now.
t1_dtnyrm6	0	*	Don't be so pedantic - Trump is a coward, and a complete retard.
t1_dto14uq	0	*	You shouldnt believe all the exaggerated drama on reddit or the media. No one is walking away from the deal, but the media will keep making it dramatic and suspenseful.
t1_dtsck39	0	*	Great, who cares, just one more Trump failure.     Gotta love that Trump DOW though. Another 600 point drop. Trump economy, as you call it, is failing. Lol, and it's fucking hilarious.
t1_dtonl3p	1	*	I like Justin, I didn't vote liberal, but his heart is in the right place, and he seems to have a genuine concern for the well being of our country 
t1_dto7adw	1	*	https://www.dfeh.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/sites/32/2017/08/DFEH_TransgenderRightsWorkplace_ENG.pdf
t1_dtoa4rw	0	*	He's sold us out internally. Can't wait to see what new pro-woman, anti-man propaganda Trudeau Jr. has for us in the coming years.
t1_dto1ebq	1	*	Have you checked the Canada-US Free Trade Agreement?  It likely applies to you as well.
t1_dtnykq9	1	*	You forgot what our military buildings to the table, which is pretty much everything in these negotiations.
t1_dto2ehk	1	*	Few people actually adhere to an ideology. But lots of people hate Trump, as a person. Trump opposes NAFTA, therefore they will reactively support it.
t1_dtocpmv	0	*	Yes he is. He once avoided answering a direct question 18 times in a row.  http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/trudeau-question-period-ethics-commissioner-1.4108903
t1_dto0cku	0	*	As a woman I don't think he  did a good job for me, or for most Canadian women. And many other groups. I am sure he did well by certain demographics though.
t1_dto07va	1	*	[Yep...](http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/harper-nafta-napping-trudeau-1.4376523)
t1_duz9u6g	1	*	I do this to myself on a regular basis - so Im an expert. And let me tell you - it is quite labour intensive to pollinate by hand.
t1_duigeu9	0	*	Yeah I was counting their donations, which is what you mentioned. https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/list.php. No need to be a prick about it.
t1_dt24nve	1	*	I was talking about the case in the posted article...
t1_dt2d4nq	1	*	Your view point on negative publicity regarding israel is seriously hilarious.
t1_dsr1phj	1	*	A really smart car though.
t1_dukywx7	0	*	Lol I'm better than a law maker. You should be worried. 
t1_dujb05r	0	*	Nope, he'd still definitely get some kind of adrenaline rush from being naughty. 
t1_duji06w	1	*	Yeah. That's so stupid
t1_dumc21d	1	*	is that a difficult thing to achieve?
t1_dumataf	1	*	It wouldn't surprise me.
t1_dumsohb	0	*	Putting him in prison makes him a martyr. 
t1_dumodku	1	*	Closer to 200lbs at a time if your delivery is about 328 yards or so away. 
t1_dumcu2p	1	*	nope, whatever man.
t1_dunlyx5	0	*	Trump is also fun to read about, but i'd imagine it's not as fun when he's running your country...
t1_duncylx	1	*	I agree with you in principal, but the show from 2016 *was* a giant lack of freedom
t1_dtzjwnc	1	*	aaaaaaand the Japanese ya know, stooped trying to kill us and all while that part happened. The Germans just said, thanks for trying, but kindly get out of our (economic) way, thanks again
t1_dtz2acz	1	*	If you aren't willing to rebuild countries you destroy, how about stop destroying them then?
t1_du1bhrq	0	*	Lol are you joking? We started the mess there. Before they had a strongman who pretty much forced order on them. ISIS wouldn't have risen under Saddam.
t1_dtzlj51	1	*	Most of it was stolen in Iraq, and given the current state of US capitalism it'd probably get stolen here too
t1_du06d0o	0	*	What would the point have been?
t1_dtz7z3s	1	*	So, rich people, corporate giveaways, and more corporate giveaways aren't benefitting the middle and lower class?  Who could have possibly guessed that.
t1_dtzsnkh	0	*	since the Revolutionary War*
t1_dtzfnso	1	*	To be fair you didn't start that mess.
t1_dtz8991	1	*	If it does cool down, it will be because of the number of heatstroke deaths and climate change.
t1_du07hzi	1	*	And we did that in Iraq. We spent billions. Then we got a new POTUS who decided to forget it because of a campaign promise and called ISIS a JV team. The rest has been history.
t1_dtzct97	0	*	Not in the UK. The US did a pretty good job of fucking the UK over after the war. Meh, all worked out for the best though
t1_dtzp8mb	1	*	Just construction costs. 
t1_dsgrf38	1	*	Oh, I got that. It was just written in such an appalling manner with obvious bias that the whole article should have ended up on the fire rather than in a newspaper.  I've decoded easier crosswords.
t1_dsgkxtp	0	*	Which would work if people were asexual machines, but when men and women work together there are bound to be misunderstandings. It is no reason to ruin anyone's life though.  
t1_duykk47	1	*	I understand that Hiroshima and Nagasaki were necessary, no worries there.
t1_durddnm	1	*	the coup attempt was after the second bomb, the japanese government had refused to consider surrender after the first. It was after the Emperor decided to surrender that the coup attempt occurred 
t1_durc1pg	0	*	we have plenty of documentation of the holocaust (and many other genocides) and there are plenty of holocaust deniers
t1_durxc86	1	*	To be fair, the Nanking Massacre specifically happened before Pearl Harbor, but you are right that a lot of bullshit happened between your points 1 and 3.
t1_durmt8u	1	*	Exactly. That was the point of my comment. Seems disingenuous for them to be publicizing this when they still deny that Nanking ever happened in spite of substantial documentation. 
t1_durkhxl	0	*	Those are two vastly different ideas. Most people are not going to discredit the experience of nuke survivors just because the current Japanese government lacks in educating what the imperial did. 
t1_durg237	1	*	The US looks like it's supporting the next reigning dictator.
t1_durwzve	1	*	Yup! Everything has English translations.
t1_durgpy8	1	*	Hey now, don't count Germany out. Looks like they're repeating some things from their early playbook.       https://www.huffingtonpost.com/abraham-h-foxman/rising-anti-semitism-in-e_b_7835610.html
t1_durmd7o	0	*	Those atomic bombs were the best move America has made, to this day.  Pretty much ended the war with a giant, retaliatory, Fuck you. 
t1_dur9v3m	0	*	Wrong. There was warning that it would happen. They just stuck around.
t1_dura3e4	0	*	Thank you for being the first sane comment in this whole thread.
t1_durhovj	1	*	Destroying two cities is technically worse than unsuccessfully poisoning entire nations.
t1_durc0nz	1	*	Russia and Cuba, if Red Dawn is to be believed.
t1_dur8khx	0	*	 Ok now convince Vladimir Putin.
t1_duroh7z	0	*	We also learned from the accidents that occurred during the Manhattan project, especially the people who died from uranium processing accidents, of which there were several.
t1_durcsf3	1	*	It's a way to deflect from the genocide they comitted.  Nothing more.
t1_durdoum	1	*	This, the what about X crime Imperial Japan committed comments rampant in this thread may not be the most tasteful thing, but they are here for a goddamn reason.
t1_durc86x	0	*	Pro tip: dont start your Saturday mornings by logging into reddit
t1_durf0d9	1	*	Because everyone will starve to death?
t1_durgwjr	1	*	What the fuck are you talking about? These are the only people left alive who had a nuclear bomb dropped on them. Ignoring them because of other bad things is censorship. 
t1_durjkau	1	*	Yep, it starts with gearing up for war in 1936 ish  and skips right to why did they bomb us?  Totally victimist with no light shed on what they did.
t1_dusbjip	1	*	They are like all dead though, but yeah the nippon kaigi an stuff will sweep it under the rug though.Besides the fact that China under Maos rule refused to take compensations after the war.
t1_dureclk	1	*	Yes thank you, thats what I meant. 
t1_durvom2	1	*	Or we could have just fire bombed them like we had been doing and kill just as many, but loose some of our bombers in exchange...
t1_durhncw	0	*	Yeah but only two caused Anime...
t1_dusjtsz	1	*	You're joking, right? Just look at which empire's hegemonies are fraying and which nascent empires are looking to take their place.  Boy, it's hard to tell where the conflict is gonna sprout from...
t1_durbcyu	1	*	Me too, honestly.
t1_dure9n8	1	*	Or you can probably go ahead and fail all of them daddy has plenty of money. 
t1_durbreh	0	*	Tiwan and China? Or perhaps North Korea and Trump.
t1_durihr4	1	*	Those were the exact words my history teacher told me as a kid (I'm 30 now). I was taught the the Kamikaze attacks was Japan's way of saying they won't surrender no matter what, so we nuked them.  
t1_dusqplz	1	*	I'd rather be instantly vaporized than gang raped and murdered by having a bayonet shoved up my asshole. 
t1_durdhx0	1	*	> Who will be willing to do the first step this time?  Don't worry, the America first movement has that covered.
t1_durcrsp	0	*	Good old revisionism. 
t1_duspvfx	1	*	I wonder why we were bombing Tokyo.  Must have been just a random act of violence. 
t1_dus9mlc	1	*	You have terrible reading comprehension.
t1_durq8el	1	*	Dolt.   (Guess there aren't a lot of KenM fans in here.)
t1_durrub2	0	*	Or they could have dropped it in the ocean and Japan would have surrendered right away.
t1_dushxdk	1	*	inperial japan = current japan. same ideologies, same line of royalties, same military flag. nothings changed. they are responsible. 
t1_durdktp	1	*	The comment they commented on was also whataboutism, it's whataboutception
t1_durmx4k	0	*	Wtf is happening in No. 9?
t1_durgedj	1	*	They should also share the stories of how they massacred Nanjing, killing as many citizens as the nuclear bombs, but one by one.  They even shoved rifles up womens vagina and shot them from inside.
t1_durl6l7	1	*	Which is mildly ironic, considering that the atomic bombs probably saved more Japanese lives than anything else in history...
t1_durg3w7	0	*	Look at what happened to Iris Chang.
t1_durakyw	0	*	You think the bombs were used because of China and Korea? 0o
t1_dudgv0y	1	*	At least he's planning on donating to a helpful charity, considering it's a quake in Mexico. 
t1_dudratz	1	*	Oh get the fuck out of here with this shit.  
t1_du75zga	1	*	They're not my buddy if they don't!
t1_du79cd4	1	*	I don't remember that.
t1_du771u5	1	*	Got a solid giggle out of you go girl
t1_du784f8	1	*	I found the loophole!  If the accused didn't do anything, there is no victim.
t1_du770q6	1	*	or a child and you're under arrest.  
t1_dv337sh	0	*	not religious myself...but aren't they also taught that suicide won't get them to heaven?  that would kinda ruin the whole imma kill myself to go see grandma point you're making.
t1_dsf0p9u	0	*	Oh no I know lightbulb planned obsolescence existed, im asking does it still? Plenty of competition in that market now to prevent it, I would have thought
t1_dseubih	0	*	It seems more like a long awaited bug-fix than a feature
t1_dsf7emr	0	*	Nah, you get a 10% discount* for returning your old iPhone to Apple. They then restore the battery and resell it.  *iPhones now are 15% increased in price
t1_dsfte4t	1	*	Then they'd get accused of trying to force you to change the battery to stop notifications. 
t1_dseq99d	1	*	aka free markets are actually not that great for innovating.
t1_dsf4slz	0	*	It gives off about as much light as a candle, and light bulbs are most likely to burn out when you turn them on. That light bulb has basically never been turned off and on.
t1_dseqtfu	1	*	Also, the problem is that Apple did NOT warn people about the slow down if they had older models when they upgraded. Instead they tried to hide their flaws.
t1_dsgavqi	1	*	Oh, phoneblocks. How sad it makes me when ever someone mentions their awesome new pixel 2
t1_dsfv0m6	0	*	They DID notify their users, in the notes. Legally, thats plenty. It was a bit of a dick move not telling people explicitly, but your objection doesnt mean anything to the court case.
t1_dsf4wko	0	*	[beeps in Scottish]
t1_dsfavu5	1	*	> *That note was pure bullshit.*  And what factual - not cynical or projection-based - information leads you to make that claim? 
t1_dsfg75n	1	*	This seems more likely.
t1_dseu0cu	0	*	iPhones are only manufactured in China. Wiko phones are designed in China (by Tinno), Wiko only does changes for the French market (LTE frequencies, translations,...).
t1_duzg5mg	0	*	Who have we ever rebuilt lol?  We don't even rebuild PR, which is our own fucking land.
t1_dshardb	1	*	I'm in
t1_dsl3s4s	0	*	just using logic
t1_dsh7dbv	1	*	A sells their product. It's a cycle.
t1_dshcn7a	1	*	Good idea! You go first!
t1_dsos890	1	*	Thats why I said possibly and not probably. 
t1_dsu6squ	1	*	Ahhh. Well that I can agree with. Ofc there are other reasons, like how they're betting the Dems take the House and Senate back and overturn the reforms. 
t1_duyz6e3	1	*	Lol
t1_dtatzdi	0	*	you are so naive.
t1_dtbf5d4	0	*	I'm not saying it wouldn't reduce violence, i'm merely pointing out weed not the only drug bought in hot spots such as Cancun, and very likely, not the most profitable. 
t1_dtdfk5j	0	*	Nope. https://www.unotv.com/noticias/estados/guerrero/detalle/acapulco-lleno-al-91-7-para-celebrar-ao-nuevo-835322/  91 per cent full just three weeks ago
t1_dtbhqt9	1	*	I agree but can also see the other side.  Many places have open container laws so I think some people are comparing it to that.
t1_dtbskqw	0	*	Nah they'll just move on to something else, like Pharmaceuticals. You really don't understand cartels 
t1_dtccmtf	0	*	Lol what? No
t1_dtbjrcs	1	*	Might even make more money legitimately. 
t1_dtbfzmd	1	*	Awesome thinking !
t1_dtb8456	1	*	likewise, cokeface
t1_dtda8n1	1	*	No lol welcome to the Internet. Not everyone is going to agree with you so your getting worked up over nothing. And if you notice I even half agreed with you that I wouldn't want to live there. 
t1_dtbqf43	1	*	This is a very conservative country, I'm in fact quite surprised 30% are in favor
t1_dtbe7zv	0	*	Cartels basically own Mexico, the mob never got near that scale.  Also, to put things in perspective, there's a huge cigarette black market.
t1_dtcetlx	1	*	Its probably more exciting for them to live outside the law. 
t1_dtb27pp	1	*	Preach
t1_dsey6uz	1	*	Yes I know. the point is that English continues to be taught in Iran, at the SECONDARY LEVEL as it ALWAYS WAS
t1_dssf8ve	1	*	Maybe you should go read it again with different glasses.
t1_dssqoc5	0	*	His father was a member of a terrorist organization, the same one that eventually became the likud party. 
t1_dstifu7	1	*	I think your point about Islam is more specific to salafis than to other Muslims (but I dont know for a fact).
t1_dst18b5	1	*	I guess it would be ok for people to feel that way about the Jews in their countries, too then, huh.
t1_dste4xy	0	*	[Anti-Racist Hitler](https://youtube.com/watch?v=XihlS9aPgMc). Warning this will trigger everyone, on every side of the debate. Personally I just find it hilarious.
t1_dstf3br	0	*	pretty sure racism isn't human nature and spawned from imperialism, but hey, when you live in a imperialistic country I guess that kinda goes over your head.
t1_dst8497	1	*	More like a strawman
t1_dtfp89n	0	*	I don't watch him, do you have links to both explicit statements?
t1_dtgsrma	0	*	Just wait til the memo releases.
t1_dtfiga6	0	*	He's playing himself right now.
t1_dth1pho	1	*	Not that I agree with you but it's possible for a media source to be wrong about one thing and correct about other things. I know this is difficult to understand because you a Trumpian but it's true.
t1_dtfis97	0	*	https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusion_GPS#Trump_dossier_and_Christopher_Steele  Uh oh. 
t1_dtf96ed	0	*	The sources above are court documents from a criminal investigation and statements from Page himself. He was cleared in 2013, this is all well-established.
t1_dtftu7m	1	*	And so highly paid!
t1_dtf0gwa	0	*	The US president is increasing sanctions against Russia, I highly doubt they wanted that.
t1_dtf3u60	0	*	Whilst also blocking the release of said memo. What a fucking joke.
t1_dtfzdvq	1	*	Yep.  And I still am.  Just like I'm laughing at you for this comment.
t1_dtfrev1	1	*	In capitalist America we make up the law to fit what we see as a crime. It doesn't matter when you did it. 
t1_dtic4cf	0	*	Globalization is not the answer.
t1_dsnrdea	0	*	Used by terrorist organisations. What exactly is the problem with calling it a 'terror tunnel'? 
t1_du3mzkk	1	*	Typical liberal bullshit, context never matters cause muh violence is wrong unless it's Obama drone striking schools and hospitals, then it's ok.
t1_du3w8i0	0	*	They not only hosted our nukes but Incirlik made a very convenient staging area for U2 overflights of Russia as well.
t1_dsqbfkx	1	*	Yeah, true, I was just thinking of the WCML though. I usually use Chiltern to visit London for a day every now and then, since it's cheaper to get one of their tickets via High Wycombe.
t1_dtozbqc	1	*	It only takes a couple of horse kicks in the face before horseshoe theory takes hold.
t1_dt2u0vq	1	*	He'd probably settle for some scratch off lottery tickets, a pack of cigarettes and a quart of beer. 
t1_dt2dsu6	0	*	You're right there was absolutely **ZERO** morons who voted Republican.
t1_dt29twp	0	*	I would have agreed with you up until Trump. If you voted for him, youre a moron.
t1_dt34tb4	0	*	Yeah because a country only has 1 problem right? It's so disgusting that people support a propaganda that started in order for Yugoslavia to claim land in Greece. Open a history book people...
t1_dt3d7e5	1	*	That's all semantics. Tell that to the Turks. I am serious. I know this stuff. They don't. They refer to Central Asian languages as dialects of Turkish.  
t1_dt3vyg9	1	*	Im sorry I dont understand. Macedonia is Greek, so I guess whatever local costume they wear would be a Greek costume. 
t1_dt7rs65	0	*	Yeah. I mean thats stupid and all but it didnt physically harm the animal unnecessarily like giving it Botox injections. 
t1_dt7r8zr	1	*	'Sheilahs' + traditional poetry
t1_ds65ivp	1	*	Well that goes without saying.
t1_ds4h07o	0	*	He said stable, not running :)
t1_ds4ltbd	0	*	Alright, a new explanation then. It looks like the South Koreans had tro try real hard to create a work place where you can't play starcraft.
t1_ds4oq3w	1	*	SPOILERS!!!
t1_ds5o23h	1	*	Lmao, I die when these responses show up. I never expect it and it's better every time.

t1_duo4w8m	0	*	Without punctuation and with every word capitalized, I read that as Don't eat blacks.
t1_duo3ivy	1	*	Yeah, what a coincidence that a german person browses reddit and reads posts about germany. And then posts something relevant about a thing that's in our newspapers today.
t1_dtnu8xk	1	*	True, but the Daily Mail is a special kind of low - always probing the depths to see what new lows can be uncovered. The worst kind of pioneers.
t1_duxdaho	0	*	How does that make him a Stalinist? Is Bernie Sanders a Stalinist for liking socialist ideas? 
t1_ds1dx93	0	*	If you read a history book youll find the US as guilty of the same atrocities as nazi Germany. 
t1_duek7bz	0	*	Well, since the lobster is a crustacean, and not a pet, who really cares? Every country has boiled them for centuries, and now they care? Seems kind of silly.
t1_dsp5mk3	1	*	Well maybe if we elected govt officials that shrunk the deficit through a reduction of the federal government as well as massive income tax cuts.
t1_dsqq84n	1	*	Money going from the taxpayer to a corporation benefiting a foreign nation in the form of a subsidy was my point 
t1_dticicf	1	*	That's a good thing for Obama, right?
t1_dtibx37	1	*	Time it and let us know. Release an edit if you want.
t1_du3xdkq	1	*	I want to watch that thing you just said. 
t1_du4apmd	1	*	I'm talking about the Baekjae era.
t1_du427lx	1	*	I was just making a funny  sorry
t1_dt6kf0z	0	*	It does work that way. I would sacrifice my career to stop a boy from literally being raped.
t1_dtbgo0i	0	*	They fixed the problem of child rape while the US hasn't.
t1_dtqx5im	0	*	You would be incredibly wrong if you assumed all or even a majority of childcare workers are like the ones you described.  Some centers you find may be glorified babysitters but many are not.
t1_dtq54u1	1	*	This is why it always strikes me as such a cunt move to shit on people who try to stand up for themselves.  I support almost anyone who strikes, if only for having the balls to do it.
t1_dtxzl47	0	*	Just listen to the scientists if you want to know if it is real. I don't know what you mean by, the biggest people against it are its biggest causes. You mean like the united States?
t1_du77rdk	1	*	I've poked more than a few needles into the subdural space, if you know what I mean.  
t1_dv3vlnb	0	*	Assuming right leaning economically means the government not taking as much control over the economy it wouldn't really be possible for an authoritarian country to be right leaning economically. 
t1_ds4074y	1	*	They are a thing. If you do something so much it hinders your life it's an addiction 
t1_dshdkmq	0	*	> Ask the Indians who oppressed them.   The Muslim invaders.  >Ask the Asians who oppressed them.  Other Asians.  >Ask the Blacks who oppressed them.  Other Africans.  
t1_dutgvn0	1	*	I've always heard that people would shoot them while riding on trains. The idea was to see who could hit the most.
t1_duuaja8	0	*	It was true during WWII. During the war, fishing was pretty much shut down due to Naval movements, and when it restarted it was like the ocean had reset.
t1_dsxlhj8	1	*	News is usually almost always written in present tense. 
t1_dtua8lm	0	*	So you're claiming that if they were to put this to a vote, the government wouldn't count the votes of the unmarried, non-muslims, and women?
t1_dsfzzsj	1	*	Brit here. I like my tea with milk and no sugar. :) 
t1_dsezkn4	1	*	A person can go their entire life avoiding heroin and be fine.  You can't realistically go your entire life avoiding sugar which makes it much easier for normal people to get addicted to it.
t1_dsf4m3w	1	*	Like Wonder Woman or someone?
t1_dshwlui	1	*	They actually don't, either, but they also get harassed and abused more frequently than the male staff.
t1_dsgraoc	1	*	I never said I did. I was speaking broadly about the nation, not nurses specifically.   And the rest of your comment is just Ad Hominem.
t1_dv0habc	1	*	Jokes on you, Monks preserved civilization.
t1_du8glke	0	*	Croatia
t1_du8m80x	1	*	Sure, but slavery is also forced work... so clearly I was not saying this Dutch law created slaves.
t1_du8pj7r	0	*	But that isn't the case. You will be asked and you will get to answer whatever you want. Your answer goes. But if you don't answer, **then** they decide for you. 
t1_du8bzgy	0	*	That's a ludicrous suspicion to have. That implies that by default, Doctors and Nurses are just waiting for this law to pass so they get on with their real agenda, which is to harvest organs.
t1_du8gioz	0	*	I've opted out long ago and indeed I don't want a transplant organ. I've only seen immense and prolonged suffering from organ transplant. But like everything in life: ymmv.
t1_du92ykf	1	*	Lol, the state doesnt own your body, Jesus, come on man.
t1_du8iz8q	1	*	Nobody should feel they need to lie about something to fit in 
t1_du92nm1	1	*	Oh no! My dead body will be used to save lives THE HORROR!!
t1_du8h0hs	0	*	I see an organ economy on the horizon ;)
t1_du8mu6d	1	*	They watch too many movies. 
t1_du8gry8	0	*	But again you already decided that you wanted to do this. The government didnt do anything for this decision.
t1_du98pib	0	*	I wonder if there is anything in the law that says the organs can only be donated for transplants. Organ donation can also mean they get donated to science. Which wouldnt make it a pointless act. 
t1_du8oj87	1	*	You mean the government made a decision for itself, to prevent medical professionals from harvesting a person? So protecting the people from shit like this? What governments real job actually is.
t1_ducaurk	0	*	Awesome, so why are't you registered now to have that stuff given away on your death?
t1_du8s9tf	0	*	If he's a millionaire (maybe billionaire, or royalty though), I can imagine he has the influence to change the prosecutors mind too.
t1_dua0lxx	0	*	>People who think nurses and doctors discriminate based on donor status don't know how it works.  Except current top comment says that's exactly what happens in Israel...
t1_duak88h	1	*	I have a friend that refuses to be an organ donor on the basis he is philosophically opposed to the perpetuation of intelligent life/sapient suffering.
t1_du8p8f1	0	*	It's kinda like Texas. Straight forward no nonsense attitude about some things, poorly thought out emotionally motivated attitude towards others
t1_du95aj2	1	*	Its not your body, because you are dead.
t1_du9zhd2	1	*	You said fuel a black market, which I took to mean making it bigger/worse. I don't see how making more legal options available would also make more illegal options available.
t1_dudvakz	0	*	k
t1_du8fcxn	1	*	It should be possible via the e-loket!
t1_du8i4gw	1	*	If I know my fucking family...believe me they will!
t1_du8rcaa	0	*	> Personally I think people that opt out should not be eligible to get an organ either  That would go directly against the Hippocratic oath.
t1_du8lk8y	0	*	Devil's advocate here.  What's to prevent them from when, in 30 or 40 years when this is old news, quietly eliminating the opt-out provision?
t1_du8nm25	0	*	Danish? It's about The Netherlands, not Denmark
t1_du8go9j	1	*	Even lovelier!
t1_du8vjdn	0	*	I take it you'd still want to receive an organ though
t1_du9ae1h	1	*	This is an attitude more prevalent in developing countries with a lower value on human life, but some people are worried that they'll be declared dead more easily if they're registered organ donors.
t1_du8lyje	0	*	well good thing i am my body, isnt it?
t1_du8fuh9	0	*	Just this big thing called body sovereignty which, in many cultures, is considered a basic human right. 
t1_du8vzx6	1	*	Because laws are never slippery slopes and we all live in a magical fairytale utopia where government always knows to never cross the line to oppressing people 
t1_ducg0aw	0	*	You said vital organs, not yourself.  You did not imply you wouldn't have clothes on nor be buried.    You only implied your vitals wouldn't be with you.  Did you read your own comment?
t1_du8jbz5	0	*	https://www.orgaandonorworden.nl/donorregistratie
t1_du8pxqo	1	*	I find it interesting how much of so much religious practice is not actually dogma but just accumulated cultural ideas that kinda attach themselves to the religious group in question.
t1_du8lyhg	0	*	There is more than one organ. You may have bad kidneys but a heart that functions perfectly. Also you can still donate those kidneys for research that will help others to not suffer as you did.  
t1_du8c3io	0	*	by saving their life instead of letting them die from organ failure?
t1_duawfwx	0	*	They need your body when you're dead. It's not really your body anymore then, is it? 
t1_du91v54	0	*	LLIIQQUUIIIIIDD
t1_du8hq0q	0	*	Yeah we did that colonizing and genociding a while back. The world didnt like it. 
t1_du94ryz	1	*	oh no, somebody cut up a dead husk and used it to save lives...
t1_du8jx25	1	*	Most (all that I know of) religions that don't allow organ donation also don't allow transplants
t1_dub6iz2	0	*	Just you wait and see.
t1_du91o57	0	*	It isn't required, not a single person will be forced into donating by a default selection that favors life.  This policy is morally right, because it defaults to valuing life.
t1_du8dp85	1	*	Of course I'm comfortable with  that. It is their organs,  not mine. How can it be right to go against their will? 
t1_du9cqut	1	*	Ikr
t1_du8isgp	1	*	Just throw me in the trash when I die. 
t1_du8r3o0	1	*	Fuck that.  Murderers sitting in prison can be at the bottom of the list. 
t1_du97lem	0	*	That's no way to speak to someone even if you deeply disagree with them. And I do disagree with the person you are responding to, but I also believe they deserve respect.
t1_du8p2rm	1	*	Well you should of thought about that before you decided to have a chronic disease!!  Jk. Luv u.
t1_du8kb7f	0	*	My mother thinks this, despite my best efforts. Its frustrating to me because shes *mostly* pro-science and bases her decisions on facts, except for this. 
t1_du8kk5e	1	*	I know better what my organs capable of. 
t1_du8hatc	1	*	In that case: who cares? The person's dead.
t1_du8nyt9	0	*	People do have religious concerns about receiving. A few Christian denominations like the jehovahs witnesses iirc don't look favorablyvon transplants or transfusions 
t1_du8zhgc	1	*	Haunt people as a ghostly flying penis, sick.
t1_du8h0pl	0	*	Within a city, you mean? Or from one city to another?  Or to move over a few steps, when you're standing in the way?  Your question is a tad ambiguous. :P
t1_du8r8r3	0	*	I guess we just have different views on the subject. But why, for no extra effort or cost, would you not want the chance to save someone's life?
t1_du8kj9h	1	*	> Unless you live in some sort of TV show  Or China.
t1_du8ih1b	1	*	I thought that was called TurboTax in the USA 
t1_du8jjyw	1	*	> Family has the last word though  Which is why I never bothered signing up. If I'm dead the only people that still care about my body will be my family, so they can say what to do with it.
t1_du8s4c1	0	*	If it's a valid reason, let hospitals turn them away. Religion can cure it all. 
t1_du8nagk	1	*	Google it. It's happened in the USA, all over Europe and Asia.
t1_du8jfrl	1	*	Holy crap, that sounds horrible. You guys didn't learn from the US's mistakes with the social security card?
t1_du8jpjr	1	*	Yes, this happens 10% of the time according to the NRC (dutch newspaper).
t1_du8kze7	0	*	Paying taxes online?? Here in the U.S. we have to wait for the tax collector to come around in his carriage. He does have a cool raven that sits on his shoulder though, so theres that.
t1_du8mdlc	1	*	Yes as of now they can 
t1_du8zamn	1	*	I don't want to donate because I can't decide who would get my organs.  I wouldn't for instance be okay with donating to an adulterer, or a racist.
t1_du8wl55	1	*	It doesnt to me but im trying to relate here
t1_du8hc90	1	*	Well it's a good thing you're not a paramedic then, you psycho.
t1_duccxgi	0	*	Irrelevant, we're talking about still having relatives.  Just opt out of the auto consent for all of your possessions.
t1_du8qot5	0	*	> it's not like the state owns your body now  Even if it was, doesn't even matter, I'm dead, who cares? Throw me in the trash.  
t1_du9kh9n	1	*	you missed the chance to ask:   Can they have the say over your dead body?
t1_du8q4fm	1	*	So only the 0.1% who ever need an organ will fill it out. That's a poinless policy to get people signed up.
t1_du8ccc3	0	*	Ok, but being a reasonably intelligent adult lets you infer that. 
t1_du98lno	0	*	There have been times when the Supreme Court has ruled than an opt-out choice isn't sufficient to preserve constitutional rights. It's op-in or nothing.
t1_du8jlym	1	*	American paranoia.
t1_du8gop5	1	*	Dont cut yourself on that edge.
t1_du8fwnh	1	*	Yes, you will be able to pay for organs too. Only 3 steps to buy the organ you fancy.
t1_du8qac8	1	*	I've had this conversation with both of my parents and my sister. We know we want to donate everything possible. 
t1_du8m5n4	1	*	No Muslims are bad and suck and need to be on a list. /s 
t1_du8cmnn	1	*	I think the fact that he could be charged for murder or manslaughter for his accident would be some disincentive no.

t1_du8wz0g	0	*	>Personally I think people that opt out should not be eligible to get an organ either. Can't have everything.  That's kinda fucked up. 
t1_du8g2ol	1	*	It varies between sects but IIRC it's a common sunni belief (I know basically nothing about Shia Islam) that the body has to be buried ASAP and intact 
t1_du8kfwe	0	*	> abortion   difference being: with abortion the result is less life, with organ donation the result is more life

t1_duzf6rf	1	*	When they're all dead other people are free to adopt their name I guess
t1_dv262zv	0	*	Catholics have no influence in Russia or Ukraine at all. Ever heard of schism? Orthodox Christianity is predominant religion there.

t1_dtqua8r	0	*	Oops. A lot of comments in this thread were talking about this being needed for corps as well and one guy saying it may be a dryrun before a more widespread implementation, including corps.

t1_ds2y9hc	1	*	US isn't innocent as well and also contributed to the failure of the talks.
t1_ds2uzrm	1	*	At least they want to have high-level talks again. It's better than not talking to each other at all. Furthermore, now it's NK proposing.

t1_dsxnem6	1	*	Those people should demand higher wages if their jobs take more skill and are in higher demand than an unskilled minimum wage job. Nearly everyone except for upper management is being underpaid.

t1_dv2xx2h	1	*	Was just about to post that, ty. 
t1_dv13zr1	1	*	Thanks for actually answering.
t1_dv11q8z	1	*	Trump should've thought of that before he suggested banning immigrants from shithole countries.
t1_dv101mj	1	*	Its k, these people from SA are white so they are probably similar to people from Norway to trump

t1_dtvsh87	0	*	???   >nothing conservational about it   Do you have the faintest idea of how a reserve like this works? At all? Do you think you just walk in, pay $5 for an all you can bag tag, and start shooting?
t1_dtx79vx	1	*	No, nothing to do with the words. Just the purpose.  Killing an animal to make yourself feel like a tough guy = douchebag. Killing an animal to eat = being a human.
t1_dtv95xf	1	*	Oh god he saves babies, it makes sense now. Thats the most conservative thing Ive heard. Does he also kills hamsters ? 
t1_dtvh3nh	1	*	People are inherently narcissistic assholes. The only solution is to divert that energy and money into something productive
t1_dtvudt1	1	*	> It is because those lions were bred specifically to be hunted.  How is that different than pigs who were breed specifically to be slaughtered?

t1_dtvtp65	1	*	Good point, good and bad news tends to hit the affluent
t1_dtxi4rh	1	*	That's a sociopathic attitude to life. Not being able to reproduce doesn't make a life pointless and does not justify early termination at the hands of someone with a fetish for killing.
t1_dtvfqc0	1	*	Jesus.. that's just making me teary.. next level cunts
t1_dtvhvop	1	*	Here's an article from the journal [Nature](http://www.nature.com/news/2003/031103/full/news031103-12.html) 
t1_dtvqfnt	0	*	> Canned hunting is nothing but sadistic fuckwits who want to torture or kill animals for fun  That often comes with money going towards conservation.
t1_dtvbhjg	1	*	Breeding for hunting is not the same as breeding for conservation.   They might also capture lions in *real* reservations. 
t1_dtvxkl3	1	*	WWF isn't reputable? Check their website. 
t1_dtvpzk8	1	*	I hear that they preset the board so the Lion has a guaranteed checkmate just so they can say the beat a human at chess.
t1_dtvgenr	0	*	...it's not the same thing at all so it doesn't apply..?   It's like saying    Okay, but how does this apply to people who kill puppies and record it?
t1_dtvpwtm	0	*	Good edit. This should be more widely seen

t1_dtvnwvr	0	*	> As another user put it, he has done more towards animal conservation than you will ever do in your entire life.  Did you know you can donate without killing shit?
t1_dtvrk99	0	*	Because it's a bias that hinders your ability to look objectively at the matter.  It's like prioritizing anything else (race, sex, nationality, team). Doing so tends to bias your cognition.
t1_dtwd5bn	1	*	Why don't you donate money to teachers instead of attending movies and concerts?
t1_dtvexg0	1	*	humans are animals too! no animal life is worth more than a rich assholes life

t1_dtwefe5	0	*	What does anything this guy has done justify his death? 
t1_dtvm1f8	1	*	Yeah I forget that a lion raised in captivity that is used to humans is more powerful than a 75 year old with a high powered rifle shooting it from a safe distance
t1_dtvepws	1	*	Traitor. How do you expect real men to pick up chicks if women know the lions we shoot are actually meek as kittens? Oh man now I'm not gonna get laid. Thank you very much for nothing.

t1_dtvlxfk	0	*	You prefer the animal to die by a spear or arrow instead of a bullet?

t1_dtkpuhd	0	*	True, but the CO2 emissions per dollar of GDP are about the same.  The US just makes way more shit per capita than the EU.

t1_dunw81j	1	*	Except military said it wasn't a burden so there goes your argument.
t1_duo7p7w	0	*	There is definitely a PC culture and it is tied to identity politics. If you cant see that I guess youre part of the problem.

t1_du33gnd	1	*	The disputed territory formally known as Syria. You can't go use sarin gas on your civilians and then expect international law to save you when no one respects yours sovereignty.

t1_duhm9sq	0	*	Please, turkey has enough kurds to kill in turkey if thats the reason for the invasion. The real reason is that turkey doesn't want a left leaning kurdish national entity on his border.

t1_dt2tmba	1	*	Hence Israel

t1_dttuq02	1	*	So some sort of medium sized government?
t1_dtu4qxg	1	*	False actually, most Americans want UNIVERSAL care, but when told their taxes would increase as a result, support for it plummets
t1_dttcped	1	*	Sounds nice not paying extra when you accidentally break a bone? I agree.
t1_dtthbrh	0	*	Some jobs (especially in the healthcare industry ironically) will fire you for having a single sick day. Happened to my mother in the past.

t1_dttbqw3	0	*	You have no idea. Come to New Zealand where you wait 6 months for anything.
t1_dtugr20	0	*	Our quality is good because it's privatized, socializing anything makes it worse. That's why treatments and cures come from the private sector.
t1_dttfoll	1	*	Oh we want it, but we also have a legalized method of bribery called lobbying that allows companies to hire people to represent the company interests, usually with donations to future campaigns.
t1_dttitt1	0	*	I assume super fun is meant to be read here as exhausting, and an exercise in the futility of explaining anything to the wilfully-ignorant.

t1_dttd9jx	0	*	I think it was about 6 or $7 per night there. That was it
t1_dttg46i	1	*	Why on earth would you be happy for any hospital to send you a bill at all?
t1_dttlq9a	1	*	Holy shit! I never realized this before. Many more things make sense when considering this. Unfortunately it causes a vicious cycle of war, military spending and dept.
t1_dttkgxn	1	*	So this guy will have to work for 3 years just to pay for his day in hospital? And that's assuming he spends **nothing** on anything else.  Somebody please explain how this makes any sort of sense...

t1_dttrveh	0	*	Holy crap you're serious. Your wife got cancer so you funraised and and maxed your credit cards. Fucking great dude. And do you have some mental gymnastics to justify our military spending as well? 
t1_dtteped	0	*	An average of about 16% of the taxes people pay go to funding the NHS, if they need it or not.  Give me back all the taxes and I have more than enough to cover private medical costs.
t1_dttcy15	1	*	Obviously suicide does not stem from a mental health issue the healthcare could assist with....
t1_dtty9ea	0	*	Yes.  VAT alone is 20% in the UK, while the highest states' sales taxes are about 9%.
t1_dttfde3	0	*	I have read numerous accounts of under qualified doctors being a prevalent issue in the system. This seems to be quite an issue as there aren't enough doctors to meet demand.
t1_dttcgbq	1	*	And apart from the US
t1_dtu47gk	1	*	After reading your post, do politicians hire a comedy writers for their speech cuz it is so fucking ridiculous.
t1_dttbudi	0	*	This might be true if the UK healthcare system was profit driven, which is not and hence the reason why it's  better and cheaper. It's a system developed to help society, not the shareholders.
t1_dttdy3b	1	*	> they are just all millionaires down on their luck  No, everyone's just not trying hard enough. You didn't even mention the bootstraps once...
t1_dttq8hb	1	*	Please explain to me this theory of too much capitalism? Also, Americans happen to be some of the most willing donors of their capital in the world.

t1_dtzbgkh	1	*	Wahrheit.
t1_dttjdyr	1	*	Ah ok well lets just all move in with you!
t1_dttjxmy	1	*	No one in your country wants it either. The politicians who vote for it access different aspects of the system than the general public. Same goes for the wealthy....
t1_dttfs3i	1	*	Agreed...and I would add if an American still supports comrade Trump then they clearly don't care about anyone or anything but hate and stupidity.
t1_dtttcd4	1	*	Those kinds of polls are buried under mountains of lobbyist propaganda against from both the democrats and Republicans 
t1_dttc13t	0	*	I also have free health care. But I can't buy BBQ dog so you definitely win.
t1_dtto0y4	1	*	Fuck off your high horse mate tories got a good number of seats in scotland
t1_dtt87sr	1	*	What exactly am I reading here? The only metric that has anything to do with healthcare is the life expectancy metric where we're like 20 spots below the UK?
t1_dttehc7	1	*	... and it would still be cheaper than the US!
t1_dtte0vd	1	*	Hope everything turns out fine! We need update checks from you regularly! ;p
t1_dtu7ka2	0	*	I wouldn't say it's an overwhelming majority. The highest polling I've seen has it at mid-50s currently. Support tends to go down if they actually poll the common pro/con arguments as well.
t1_dttva0l	1	*	We dont as much anymore. 
t1_dttbblh	0	*	I feel sorry for us too. Plus, they keep bringing that stupid fucking conference up here..
t1_dttefh6	1	*	If you can't afford medical insurance, how the fuck are you going to be able to afford to move?
t1_dttdak2	1	*	Well, no go zones are a thing. But the healthcare is still basically free. They are two opposite things.
t1_dttdjkg	1	*	Maybe they are going into collections because healthcare is too expensive for anyone but the wealthy now? I mean, it isn't like that is the main problem trying to he fixed or something... S/
t1_dttmz9j	1	*	Dude, I know millionaires without insurance!!!
t1_dttwnti	1	*	Fair enough. That being said, he's still lying because he is denying the claims made on the rally.
t1_dtthwxu	1	*	Look at it another way. What would you do tomorrow if you got laid off and got sick the next day? Seriously sick.  I'm in New Zealand, and I'd walk into a hospital and be sorted.
t1_dtu03ss	0	*	Ergo, if you're poor, you deserve to die if you get sick.  Totally follows.

t1_dttj7gt	1	*	HOW THE FUCK DOES THAT COME OUT OF A URETHRA JESUS FUCK
t1_dttnuor	1	*	We want it, at least most people who aren't rich or stupid.  We seem to have little control over the situation.
t1_dttbzg3	1	*	pretty sure nose bleeds can be dangerous as fuck tho if it doenst stop, especially for older people who take medicine. i agree with the sentiment overall tho
t1_dtu1336	0	*	Cute. I have an adult job. I've been a Rights and Clearances Supervisor for television for the past 10 years.

t1_dttctz9	1	*	American here. This guy gets it.
t1_dttzrxh	1	*	I think all the people who realize how fucked it is don't do anything about it and the people who don't realize it are the ones who go out and support whatever freedom is going on.
t1_dttgkgc	1	*	They try and say that its the government stealing their money to give to someone who didnt work for it. 
t1_dtu8h3p	1	*	yes you are totally right. Where I live we have free healthcare and it works fairly well. There is also private health care that you can pay for. 
t1_dttshqi	1	*	That happens in America too though. So I don't think any amount of fee you put in place would deter people.

t1_dttf8mn	0	*	That sounds awfully traumatic. I'm glad you got through it ok   ;) 
t1_dtthw8j	1	*	Some states have free ambulance in Australia, they add a small fee on electricity bills for it
t1_dttgoiq	0	*	That's awful. I wonder if it's the nature of how you pay for the system vs how well funded the system is vs the individual doctors being useless? 
t1_dttvcsf	1	*	This is literally what Republicans think. 
t1_dtujd50	1	*	Touche. 
t1_dttktvs	1	*	We are easily the most free country. That's a basic fact. It's not even debatable. 
t1_dttefjt	1	*	And since its through the employer, people cant change jobs or quit. Its another form of wage slavery, health insurance slavery.
t1_dttcq7b	1	*	Meanwhile, their military is the biggest socialised government program in the history of the universe. 
t1_dttk7ix	0	*	fair enough. 
t1_dttcv55	0	*	Even libertarian's agree that the stat would pay for the Army.   The Army, the police and Courts would be payed for by taxes.

t1_dttegn3	1	*	Finally, someone said it

t1_duy8i48	0	*	They didn't throw a tantrum and it wasn't because they got in trouble.   Maybe don't sentence someone to prison for two years for fucking with the fryers at Burger King.

t1_dtnyuy1	0	*	If you stick to just potatoes, nothing can go wrong.   Edit: It's a historical joke, people. Don't you get it?
t1_dsns410	1	*	And when you consider the size of Hawaii and the accuracy of North Korea's nukes, the chances of you even being within 15 miles of impact are pretty slim. I just wouldn't worry about it.
t1_dsnlorf	1	*	fuck that! I'll sleep when I'm DEAD!

t1_dsn3ss7	1	*	No dont listen to that guy; hide under a desk, because remember kids, duck and cover like Bert the Turtle!    That will totally protect you from a nuclear blast. Or radiation poisoning.
t1_dsntqxq	1	*	Your right! Scary how often it gut instinct that saved the planet. 
t1_dsn0msw	1	*	There's also a chance that you could be far enough away from the blast to not be vaporized. Might as well try to find somewhere safe and hope you aren't too close to the blast
t1_dsn8ycf	0	*	Would you suffocate? 
t1_dsn63kq	0	*	Nah, led lined fridge. Every time.
t1_dso7sbv	0	*	ICBMs follow a trajectory.  Don't you think it would be in the best interest of national security to have everyone thinking that ICBM defences are less effective than they actually are?

t1_dsmp0nx	0	*	Are you suggesting the nuclear command uses the emergency alert system for its data?  
t1_dsncr6u	0	*	I would be ok with them doing this once, and only once. That being said, I strongly suspect the correction would have come just a bit quicker if that was the intent.

t1_dsnqpnx	1	*	Or potato in Latvia.

t1_dsn3648	0	*	nothing was putin motion  lol
t1_dsngxp9	1	*	Yeah I think it had to do with which carrier you were on, but what I was pissed about was that everyone in my family got the alert except for me. I was like wtf AT&T wants me to die.
t1_dsnco0f	1	*	I'm not sure this would require a grand conspiracy. It just requires knowing who the person is that has access and a bit of leverage on them.
t1_dsn7j1a	0	*	US doesn't need permission to nuke other countries, especially limp dick north korean ones. learn some patriotism.
t1_dsn8hiw	1	*	Well, seeing how much news is actually fake. Really activates the almonds.
t1_dsn2qdy	0	*	Get a tennis racket and try smacking it back.
t1_dsnjwoz	0	*	Yeah if it wasn't an accident my thoughts were it was actually a drill posed as a real situation, so people get a reality check and make sure they are ready in case something ever *does* happen.
t1_dsodvga	0	*	He's not in Hawaii, he's not potentially dying. She is.
t1_dsnhzf7	1	*	Yup. And hawaii isnt exactly gun friendly.
t1_dsn8qyf	1	*	Treating any alert as if it isn't real will cost lives.
t1_dsnajgr	1	*	This has nothing to do with military response.  We do not fire nuclear missiles based on text messages.

t1_dsn74ph	0	*	Thanks for clearing up my misunderstanding, I've been definitely misinformed throughout my life about how terrible nukes were.
t1_dsnf4xf	0	*	Those warnings scare me as is. And thats fucking terrifying. 
t1_dsmweyk	0	*	Supposedly the worst damage actually happens about 1/4th of a mile from the point of impact. 
t1_dsmz7is	1	*	Well in my opinion, Mad Max is fucking cool so there.
t1_dsnnkwl	1	*	Sounds like the plot to a Matthew McConaughey film
t1_dsn6t1w	1	*	It's extra-small because someone sending it is more interested in the burn everything radius, and so will set the bomb to go off well above ground level.
t1_dsn5723	1	*	Absolutely. 
t1_dsn5z27	1	*	I can see you scrounging around for bottlecaps before it happens
t1_dsn0lda	1	*	I'm ready, I have my trusty Geiger counter.    I seem to have misplaced my dosimeter,  though. 
t1_dsrrfq5	0	*	This interface looks like the most basic HTML one could possibly write.
t1_dsn3rvx	1	*	If you are far enough away though, you would just get irradiated and die painfully over a longer period of time.
t1_dsnbyca	1	*	I think you overestimate how long it takes for a missile to travel. 
t1_dsn6tuk	1	*	More likely NK would have shot a missile off the coast of Hawaii, like they threatened to do with Guam. I wouldn't be surprised if the US government downplayed that. 
t1_dsneaa5	1	*	oddly specific. 
t1_dsnb5mh	1	*	Except they could say THIS IS ONLY A TEST

t1_dsn97cl	1	*	I'd probably think the same thing. Who the fuck would bomb Hawaii right now?  North Korea? Can't.  Russia? Wouldn't. (At least not deliberately). 
t1_dsn6ko0	0	*	They probably knew quickly that it was likely an error, but needed to be absolutely sure before giving the all clear. 
t1_dsnu2h9	1	*	And NK only gets one shot....
t1_dsipcqv	1	*	Sounds like an invasion. 
t1_dtcybne	0	*	That's a fair point. A US president is the worst possible guest ever. All that security bullshit is the last thing you want at your wedding.

t1_duhs4al	0	*	America has worse of all of those things you said lol

t1_duhotdm	0	*	I hadn't heard about this case... wow that's horrific
t1_duhrhpm	1	*	The problem is that prescriptive solutions are not taken up by the communities... and action inhibiting solutions that work are decried as racist.  
t1_duheepr	1	*	I heard that in some of the smaller villages, there were no women left after the authorities went though. :/
t1_duhbbbr	0	*	True the English exported a lot of their religious crazies to the New World then imported new ones from their overseas empire.

t1_dv54bda	1	*	No. Kushner is through.
t1_dth1yxu	1	*	Yep, the greater difference is that they choose to do it.
t1_dthknia	1	*	> The right isn't the expectation.  Yes it is.  Unless you're in China.
t1_dthpi24	1	*	This is why I am pro-choice. Abortion becoming illegal is an excellent goal in the long run, but first work needs to be done to keep the situations that cause abortions from happening.
t1_dthfnuc	1	*	Sweden sterilized some 31,000 people. America sterilized around 65,000.  Per capita, Sweden was much worse.

t1_du7p2r8	1	*	That was my basis but I guess it is different enough to be a standalone article  
t1_du87rxp	1	*	Shit article. The legal age for sex with an adult is 15 in France.
t1_dtlram5	0	*	As it has shown to do in the past century, eh? This goes well beyond money. Unfortunately it is a political career killer no prime minister dares to take.
t1_duumcyf	0	*	Sink them along with the entire crew except one who gets to live to tell the tale.
t1_duum7cl	1	*	Kind of like one of them is a citizen exercising a constitutionally protected right and one is a corporate venture breaking national and international law. 
t1_duvi0iz	1	*	Maybe have the major economic centers of each nuked and see how we all fare in a post capitalist world.
t1_duucig5	0	*	I got confused there for a second cause the countries didn't add up. I think you meant 6 other countries have 1 or 7 countries have one.

t1_duuipnl	0	*	Yeah and who says theyre not just a bunch of super rich Chinese dudes with a fishing business? Its of commercial interest and most likely a company who thinks they can get away with it.

t1_duuwfkr	0	*	Yeah you forgot the part when the British were illegally dumping the chinese market with opium since it was already banned in China.
t1_duu8jqy	1	*	They don't regret fishing illegally, they regret getting caught. 
t1_duv4in6	0	*	> The entire case revolves around whether theyre considered fish or part of the seabed.   They're a crustacean which isn't a fish and, unlike coral reef, isn't part of the seabed. 
t1_duutjch	1	*	Favela people are not the problem. The problem are the criminals that hide there and operate from there.  Generalizing that all favela people are to be contained is a bad call.
t1_duum0fk	0	*	To anyone who is pointing out some other country. Fuck you and your whatabout-ism Trumpfuckery.. 
t1_duuybo0	1	*	That sounds better. Just putting up with it. China gets away with a lot because we let them. 
t1_duv5vvw	1	*	They will blow your ass out of the water. Of you wont follow orders to stay out of their waters, what other orders will they be willing to violate?
t1_duuwb8q	1	*	Ahh, I misinterpreted your comment. That would be great sub training.
t1_duuw71c	0	*	China would need to sail their fleet all the way to Argentina and sit offshore and attack them. I doubt the PLAN would be successful at all.  Most likely china would punish them economically.
t1_duueb53	0	*	India doesn't really have the best streak in their judicial system 
t1_duuos8d	0	*	There has never been a single non-Chinese or Chinesea-paid source stating that the people of Tibet prefer Chinese rule. Holy fuck. You are CLEARLY Chinese or being paid to post this propaganda. 
t1_duupqrx	0	*	Sure but they continue to do so when we all know better today. 
t1_duuw45q	1	*	Get off my lawn!  Got em. China is afraid. 
t1_duutcb5	1	*	Ohhhhhh you're a crook, Captain Hook....
t1_duuohmx	1	*	Fuck that gator.
t1_duv95jt	1	*	Ah. But like anyone who operates a lever, the Chinese have to know at which point they need to readjust the fulcrum and the grip. Or it won't move. And worse, the lever breaks. 
t1_duujcfy	1	*	Maybe cuz this us an English speaking website...?
t1_duue5jz	0	*	I'd like to think this is one case where nearly everyone would side with Argentina.
t1_duuo0pe	1	*	Classic China 
t1_duukbz8	1	*	Yeah, that's the way they come across to me, too. Good on Argentina for not taking their shit.

t1_duu7ca4	1	*	True 
t1_duuu5ug	1	*	really? Why's that?

t1_duuc1wd	1	*	Its a bread joke. Baguette it ?
t1_duuk5cq	1	*	Incompentency!? Making people dissapear before you give their babies to your other soldier friends or tossing them into the ocean from a plane is no incompetency

t1_duur10m	0	*	Hey look! China has troll farms just like Russia!
t1_duujq0l	0	*	You're ignoring his actual point to make a quick jab, though.   China very much likes to *present the image* that they promote human rights. They pay the *concept* a *lot* of lip-service.
t1_duu7oft	0	*	Wait, source ?
t1_duuoer1	0	*	Yes, actually. Crustaceans too. Shrimp fishing is a huge destroyer of the oceans.

t1_duucm0z	1	*	Not surprising at all. Look up the history of Cinco de Mayo.
t1_duuzq7a	0	*	You know, they don't deal with only one problem at a time.  Also, this hapened in the 60s.
t1_duuk27o	1	*	China confirmed for ancap paradise 
t1_duuqy4a	1	*	You discovered my nefarious plan! Curses! 
t1_duuzdy4	1	*	From what I've read Japanese whalers seem to be often content to research what are usually considered protected species though

t1_duukg0x	1	*	Its because the rarer a species, the higher the price. The motivation is money, not some programming in people's head.

t1_dt89ic8	0	*	i assume they do since germany does.  in theory you are not allowed to just walk around and call people asshole etc. afaik you can't even flip them off.
t1_dt716vn	1	*	Slipper slope is not always fallacious. Depends on the context and the evidence at hand. 
t1_dt7noyr	0	*	It's been so long since I've read it. Care to provide the relevant passage? (I assume it's a specific thing from one of his books, could be a personal comment or general attitude though)
t1_dt76qcz	1	*	You likely coerced her, which essentially means you basically raped her.  You should resign your job and live in shame without future career prospects. 
t1_dt6sjsu	0	*	It tastes like chicken.

t1_du0wc3u	0	*	Yeah, we do say the same about muslims. The vast majority are regular people, but there's that 0.01% that is extreme.

t1_du1k99a	1	*	Very good point. It's the being forced which is not acceptable. They should be able to to decide themselves in freedom. But the possibilty should be there.
t1_du1kpme	1	*	It is not a *conscious* choice, you are not deciding on it after a lot of reflecting, but there is still a cause behind it. There is a reason, something is causing it.

t1_dshe4hu	1	*	If they want to do business in Canada, they can suck it up. They profit from the society we have built. They can put something back into it.

t1_dshceu9	0	*	ur white 
t1_dsh3xbh	0	*	You're missing the point entirely. Raising the min wage is a Band-Aid solution to a gaping wound. All Wynne has done is cause inflation to happen faster. 
t1_dshrtgt	1	*	Referring to standard practice of paid breaks, not the ESA. 
t1_dsguc6l	0	*	Brazilian actually
t1_dsgx4gk	1	*	Let's call that a half hour.
t1_dshbkz1	1	*	As a Maritime coffee drinker I find this hilarious.
t1_dsp3ya0	1	*	Yup, most chains except Tim Hortons prior to this never paid for breaks... McDonald's is a prime example.
t1_dsh0sak	1	*	Hey good idea!!! Same benefits tho right??? Dont wanna get fucked over by a greedy capitalist company, damn them!
t1_dshnbd4	1	*	Starbucks is gross asf. American coffee is gross asf. I hope Canada has it better.
t1_dsh0iwp	1	*	Bob Loblaw lobs law bomb!
t1_dsh7szv	1	*	when I compare a regular us McD's with one here in austria with an attached mc cafe I can see the reason why 
t1_dsh36uo	1	*	Depends, are the Tim Hortons cash registers from like 1987?
t1_dsjx17b	1	*	Lol of course that's the reason they're gonna give you their job is to make money while keeping you happy.
t1_dsh2xpd	1	*	Tim Hortons coffee is my almost last choice for coffee.  It is horrible.  I will do instant coffee before I do Tim Hortons.  I've had worse... but that's not common.
t1_dsgwxfh	1	*	Yea I make my own coffee in the morning now. If I want another I'll go to McDonald's or anywhere else really. Not happy at what timmy's has become.
t1_dsgzws5	1	*	That sir or madam, is a /r/HighQualityGifs. 
t1_dsgzwst	1	*	Can't forget CC Jitters
t1_dshys54	1	*	The commitment to walk an hour to a Tim Hortons is impressive though.
t1_dsh7ddu	1	*	>Canada - mediocre but inoffensive  Sounds about right
t1_dsh09xc	1	*	I've heard this, but they only seem to be around the downtown area.
t1_dsh4urn	1	*	Australia was founded as a prison, doesn't mean it has to be now.
t1_dsh98fv	1	*	I would hardly classify people potentially losing their jobs as hilarious.
t1_dsh0x18	1	*	Thanks, fam. That makes a LOT more sense now.
t1_dshbxx8	1	*	This.  It used to be great.  Then they decided they needed to sell every food product under the sun, and it's gone downhill since.
t1_dsiky8z	1	*	The monkey claw is smelly.
t1_dsgws1k	1	*	Wow. I just realized I work a block from where that black and white photo at the end of the gif was taken.
t1_dshfqty	1	*	Circle-jerk ruiner!
t1_dsh6pb8	1	*	the shareholders?  like pensions and mutual funds?  should they take their money elsewhere?  just say the word and we can close down tim hortons and invest elsewhere if you think that would be better.
t1_dshczev	1	*	Your high quality gif submitted by AntiJordanPeterson.   Holy shit, that guy has *really* struck a nerve. He's got to be one of the most polarizing people on the planet. 
t1_dshcy0a	1	*	I highly doubt that, one of my regulars wants just broth and its a massive pain in the ass to do since there isnt a funnel small enough. nobody is slowly ladeling out broth every single time.
t1_dshql36	1	*	Then change the name to comfortable wage.
t1_dsh2c04	0	*	Soley to buy votes? The minimum wage was totally due for an increase. Not sure how you can get around that.
t1_dsh6l7t	1	*	Idk how it is for all McDonalds but the one I work at, if someones on break they aint coming off break, usually a manager helps out instead.   Any other place? Cant speak for haha
t1_dsgxeec	0	*	Don't you dare compare the hip to BNL. I enjoy some BNL every now and then, but the hip are Canadian royalty.
t1_dsh0stx	1	*	Well, that explains so much about the coffee changes at both places. 
t1_dsgz915	0	*	absolutely, after the hydro stuff I imagine it's the same thing..but I lie to myself every night sleeping in a fetal position that everything will be better 
t1_dshcf8r	1	*	Billions of dollars earned through fraud isn't superfluous. 
t1_dyd90mc	1	*	I know I'm 3 months late, but Tim Horton's and McDonald's have the EXACT same coffee, so whenever you hear someone say one is better than the other, they're lying.
t1_dsgy0q5	1	*	you probably order the chicken noodle soup, try ordering the chicken noodles soup next time 
t1_dsgy3us	1	*	Bad luck mate. It's the opposite for me.  Soup has so much stuff that by the time I finish the solids, there's about a tenth if the bowl of broth left 
t1_dshmmif	1	*	Watch it you! My store is closing in 2 months! 
t1_dshdtdt	1	*	Tim Hortons on the military base at Kandahar so that the soldiers could feel at home is typical Canadian identity marketing for them
t1_dsgxoz7	1	*	by the unwashed masses
t1_dsgzntp	1	*	Second Cup is the Sears of coffee
t1_dsgxs58	1	*	well, some of us are wrong.   not to mention, they still have breaks.    just not paid breaks.
t1_dsh49t3	1	*	It may be mediocre, but its palatable to everyone. What could be more Canadian than that?  Canada just got roasted more than any Starbucks bean ever did.
t1_dsgxex3	0	*	I'm sure shareholders love that Americans like me well plan to never buy their coffee after this.  What makes you so sure this backlash isn't worse for business?
t1_dsgxjn6	1	*	heaping doses of canadian identity with every bite
t1_dshdoh7	1	*	For me the new Tim's taste like burnt popcorn, it's a real off-putting taste, I rarely go to Tim's anymore and if I do it's either tea or an ice capp....no coffee!
t1_dshzzga	1	*	I'll give the sub a shot. R/Canada is absolute shit.
t1_dshsvsq	1	*	Um the United States? We're talking about Canada here.  15 Canadian isn't a lot, it's like 12 bucks American.
t1_dsh5zcw	1	*	Also I know like 5 on the list of 15. How am I ranking the rest of them accurately? People probably just did their top 3-5 and left the rest what ever they were. 
t1_dsh36y7	1	*	I think we're exporting more than we're importing at the moment lol. 
t1_dsgx0dq	1	*	From Tims to Mcdonalds huh? One evil for another evil 
t1_dshfop4	1	*	That would have happened regardless.
t1_dsgyykb	1	*	McD's is making bank in America. Maybe your city has a few crappy locations but world wide they are a major power.
t1_dsh8yfa	1	*	To own a franchise, you actually do have to be a millionaire.
t1_dsh6mm6	1	*	I want better for Sears. Ive always hated Tim Hortons 
t1_dsh1cmg	0	*	Entertainment is the same way. It's Industry standard. Good luck telling your workers their not getting a paid 15
t1_dsgxwdi	0	*	Lobbing law bombs?
t1_dsh5igm	1	*	Understandable.
t1_dshn2l1	1	*	I don't know if it's timing or location, but since I moved to NB last year, Starbucks pastries have also started to taste like the freezer. Might not help that I usually don't ask to have them heated.
t1_dsh1dwb	1	*	r/OnGuardForThee is hardly friendly. Same shrill tactics as metaCanada. I lasted about 3 days there before the shouty-noise drove me away. 
t1_dsi0sco	1	*	I've heard McD's are generally much higher quality abroad, which is why their international reputation is rosier.
t1_dsgzpwy	1	*	Yes, and franchise owners also do what Corporate tells them to do if they want to keep their franchises.
t1_dshlwxl	1	*	I want my up to 75% off donuts!
t1_dsh21l0	1	*	You sir, are a mouthful!
t1_dsh63iu	0	*	What if I don't care about the Tragically Hip?
t1_dsh0kjz	1	*	I don't think so buddy
t1_dsh193a	1	*	A franchise that gets backpay from a corporation that posts profits every quarter and is consistently cutting quality and raising prices.
t1_dsh19ns	1	*	The stuffing mines are ours!!!
t1_dsh5gr2	1	*	McDonalds isnt much better than Tims from a corporate ownership perspective 
t1_dsh5egc	1	*	Potentially partially because some of the additives aren't allowed in Canada :-)
t1_dsgzkk2	1	*	> when theyre getting killed here.  They're not tho
t1_dsh4yuk	0	*	Are you sure? McDs definitely costs more depending on where you go in the US, so there is a cost of living/rent aspect to it.
t1_dsh4ta8	1	*	Coffee breaks smoke breaks paid breaks are all the same thing. If you dont take them a company wont make you. They dont want to pay you for nothing. 
t1_dshzeyx	1	*	Their dark roast is pretty good I find 
t1_dsh1h6y	0	*	To be fair, the benefits sucked and my son was still under my insurance. He took the cash payout instead which was like $150 per year or something.  
t1_dsidvx4	1	*	Quit chin wiggling fatboy
t1_dsh0t46	0	*	Well now I think that number is ridiculous. I spend 8 million on Popeye's *myself* in a year.
t1_dshcnuw	0	*	Keep your comment in your pocket!
t1_dsgxya5	1	*	It's more just the McCafe part of McDonalds that's thriving, I believe their overall revenue is down in Canada as well. 
t1_dshrx4p	0	*	I know the difference,  but profit is profit. You on the other hand are mistaking actual people for profits. Try to not be such a condescending asshole, on the internet and in your day to day life.  
t1_dshbf6y	1	*	and Blackberry
t1_dshawzs	0	*	Have you tried McD coffee in the US? it's total garbage. I think they're just using good coffee in Canada to compete with Timmy's
t1_dsgyus6	1	*	You have to have a net worth of over a 1.5 million and liquid assets of over $500,000 to own a Tim Hortons franchise so they are millionaires.
t1_dsh79lp	0	*	These specific franchisees are the original owning family and made the decision from their home in Florida, though.
t1_dsgxlc0	0	*	This is an incredible gif, literally had me chuckling at work.
t1_dsh4y9u	1	*	Long as we get straight that force the hand just means invent new ways to eke out absurd profit by stiffing their workers  
t1_dsh4pjr	1	*	These idiots don't even realize that the actions they're protesting were done by a handful of franchisees, and the stores that they're boycotting/protesting are completely unrelated.
t1_dsh1ljc	1	*	Americans can keep Nickelback.  Im fine with trading them for a bag of pucks and some tape.
t1_dshowp1	1	*	It is in fact a break, apparently one that you take for granted.
t1_dsh8dif	1	*	That's cause it's literally dehydrated prepackaged  nonsense that they add water to. It's worst than worst
t1_dshh6ln	1	*	Is remaining profitable through change arbitrary?  I thought that was one of the main points of being a good businessman.  Thanks for the suicide vote. I'll take it into consideration. /s 
t1_dshjd0g	1	*	Time makes Sears of us all.

t1_dshsn10	1	*	Just make the minimum wage $100 an hour and everyone can be rich and escape poverty!  Has nobody considered this before?
t1_dsh0ouj	1	*	I'm in the US and got paid breaks during my high school and college jobs, but perhaps I was just lucky! They weren't long, but I did not have to clock out just to take a quick break. 
t1_dshhne6	1	*	Start taking the breaks. If you're terminated, file for unemployment saying you were fired for exercising your rights under the ESA. EI will likely get the MoL involved for you in that case.
t1_dt8gcpx	1	*	Yes, unfortunately, that seems to be the case.
t1_dt95buy	1	*	There are actually ways for adults to kink and stuff looking or acting younger without harming everyone   See also: BDSM

t1_dt81v4a	0	*	Do you not know how culture works?
t1_dt7wfqj	0	*	Yes, by all means, let's execute people for thoughts in their head. That's the mark of a civilized world.
t1_dt8jpdu	1	*	Uhhh duh. 
t1_dt7yagt	1	*	How would you know who is or isn't one if they don't tell you or act on it before they act on it?
t1_dt7k92p	0	*	No, but did you read the article? Big difference between thinking a 17 year old is sexually attractive, and raping and murdering a 6 year old.
t1_dtl5nlt	1	*	What are you talking about. Pretty much all the Nazi Extermination camps were located in occupied Poland 
t1_dtgg9wo	0	*	Boohoo cry to the US. To ignore your war crimes.
t1_dtfe4hv	0	*	Auschwitz-Birkenau, Sobibor, Treblinka, just off the top of my head.  They were a half dozen in Poland, at least.  Auschwitz is shown in the article.    ETA:  In fairness, was Nazi occupied Poland.
t1_dtf0uaj	0	*	So its a Polish Museum now?
t1_ds5yhy0	0	*	Id argue we can take our standard of living down a notch
t1_ds5sr7v	1	*	Litter is a different problem. True, littering plastic is worse than other materials, but the solution to litter is not recycling.

t1_dtatt8m	0	*	If even one third of them voted it would be enough to change some states. 
t1_dtbqvgq	1	*	That's already taught in schools. How much education do you think a person needs to become completely immune to advertising,  propoganda, and misleading stories? 
t1_dtbr80i	0	*	Well I see Russia is following Hannity and the NRA around throwing money and support. I haven't seen reciprocation. 
t1_dtao1vb	1	*	You say this as if politicians truly represent their constituents in the first place.
t1_dtatuqd	1	*	Because its a foreign power trying to undermine your government and its not like all the bs tries to seem credible at a glance. 
t1_dsrkszj	1	*	No wait what I said that he was referring to the people,  not the places.
t1_dsrrkct	0	*	No he didn't. He outright said it didn't happen in his TV interview on Sunday.
t1_dsrinmz	0	*	On reflection I felt that it was an superfluous addition and the point was already sufficiently expressed.
t1_dsrji1i	1	*	If thats the case, The White House is a complete shithole. Should be renamed The Shitehouse.
t1_dsfjsf7	0	*	Its subjective. You dont know youre crossing a lone until youve already crossed it, since the line moves with each woman.
t1_dsfottn	1	*	It also makes dating a lot less likely. Believe it or not lots of couples are together because one chased the other
t1_dtbpfc6	0	*	So what makes you think W was trying to do the right thing?

t1_duhvb0s	0	*	Yep
t1_du4b9za	1	*	He's not gonna live through his sentence whether it's 20 or 100 years because he's old 
t1_du4bjtj	1	*	Or at least vocally so, although this level of delusion is fucking appalling.
t1_du4c0on	1	*	That's always the way it works. Cops get more lenient punishments, and judges even more so.
t1_dt919pu	1	*	If you get sick, like cancer, it's God's plan. 
t1_dt807m0	1	*	I bought my own set when we moved into our current place, I was just making a bad joke.

t1_dsm38v9	0	*	Are you seriously saying both parties are shit despite overwhelming evidence that the dems are nowhere near as bad as republicans?
t1_dsly7ux	0	*	He literally did not make fun of that reporter. He used hand gestures he's used many times before, it just so happened to look like he was using them to make fun of the guy's disability.
t1_dslyu9s	0	*	Id say many people didnt vote for trump, they just voted against Hillary.

t1_dslycxn	1	*	At least you got the right options haha I'm Chinese and was always asked, more so in middle school, Japanese or Korean? I would just say neither and get a confused look.
t1_dslvuul	1	*	Also in AL. Sorry for those people.
t1_dsm24w1	1	*	...I cannot decide if he would respond 'no' to preserve what little image he has left, or 'yes' because he doesn't know what it means

t1_dslzome	1	*	Three are like du du du but one is like duuuuuuuu
t1_dslw7y5	1	*	And so he should be. Hes British.
t1_dsm0h1e	1	*	Then I would say ethnicity, but I am sure you would understand contextually.
t1_dslpno1	1	*	Arbitrary differentiation.
t1_dsm58jw	1	*	I wanted to ask the same thing but as a joke. Seems that you are actually serious. SAD.
t1_dsm2za0	0	*	President Kamala Harris has a nice ring to it.
t1_dslxi4l	0	*	Well Obama had 8 years to take everyone's guns and enact sharia law. He failed miserably. All he accomplished was lowering unemployment and getting millions of people healthcare. Worst terrorist ever.
t1_dslz8j6	1	*	I've told people I'm Irish, and had them dismiss that because there's something more. I mean, I am mixed, but I don't need strangers poking around in that.
t1_dslx9jo	1	*	I suggest a quick resumed read on Haitian history
t1_dslv9yi	1	*	What I usually ask is, Whats your ethnic heritage? Being Filipino, I think it softens it a bit.
t1_dslwlxd	1	*	The expensive kind.
t1_dslxxvy	0	*	Ok perhaps, but would he realize that OP is from Asia, or would he just see someone with brown skin?
t1_dsly20n	0	*	Sure. what's your ethnicity or even are you Chinese? is less annoying to me.
t1_dsm1n31	0	*	That's the problem, we're hugely relevant.  If we were irrelevant Donald Trump would be harmless.
t1_dslznil	1	*	I'll break into people's homes at night and wreck up the place!
t1_dsm5301	1	*	Trump, who is literally a compulsive liar anyway? U0001f602U0001f602
t1_dsm98bg	1	*	German here. Why was this even a thing?  Is Dijon mustard frowned upon because its too rough for americans and Obama eating it made republicans aware of their wussness or....?
t1_dsm0s90	1	*	But, in more general terms, the job of president IS a public servant
t1_dsm0llk	1	*	Dope taupes
t1_dslwjuv	0	*	I mean I don't really like how Obama Care is set up. I think it could have used a much better plan. Particularly not giving people a financial punishment for not having  insurance
t1_dsmd8zs	0	*	Thats the fakest comment yet. I happen to live in a flyover state, a lot of people do, you know. 
t1_dslye0h	1	*	Well if you're my friend, I don't really care, it's really only just annoying when strangers press the topic.

t1_dslx803	0	*	Trump didnt win the vote.  He won the electoral college.  Hillary Clinton won the vote itself by about three million.  Carry on.
t1_dslzqxf	0	*	What kind of retard does that in the current climate. You have to be pretty fucking stupid. Wait..................................  I keep on forgetting he is pretty stupid
t1_dslwapn	0	*	If somebody can truly come out in support of Trump at this point, I am sorry but you are everything Trump manages to project himself to be including; racist, sexist, and a fucking moron
t1_dslubfr	1	*	I ask everyone where they are from. I love geography so it's just interesting to me to hear that someone is from 2 hours away or around the worls
t1_dslvsui	1	*	It brat out the wurst in all of us. 
t1_dslwsmt	0	*	Are you curious about the heritage of every white person without a foreign accent? No? Then its not really plain old curiosity now is it 
t1_dsm5j66	1	*	keep dreaming
t1_dsm0v0e	0	*	Yeah, but it seems kind of weird to ask what race are you? as a get-to-know-you question. It's not offensive, but maybe a bit rude. 
t1_dslxrqy	1	*	It wasn't until your reply that I got the reference. Holy crap. Haha.
t1_dslwd9i	0	*	No.

t1_dslzaio	0	*	I've never thought about how fucking much I want to see the look on Trump's face as he gets beaten in an election. I'd never be able to get the stains off the ceiling after that.
t1_dslxbhd	1	*	Thats why I didnt and dont, my dude. Im just commenting on a reddit thread. 
t1_dslymom	1	*	Well, lots of guys. 
t1_dslwf7o	1	*	Honestly, just don't. You automatically isolate the person and make them uncomfortable. 
t1_dslxkmt	1	*	Listen to him on Marc Marons podcast, it was right after the sandy hook shooting. He is an amazingly stoic human being. 
t1_dsm370z	1	*	Oh my god that's fucking hilarious
t1_dsm2pk9	1	*	Ethnicity is your heritage, which for everyone not Native American is definitely NOT American. 
t1_dsm0kgs	1	*	People with foreign accents get asked it all the time. 
t1_dslwj1o	0	*	I've noticed that in some of the more \*ahem\* conservative places, people just assume that all Asians are Chinese, which is why they don't bother to ask. 
t1_dslv0t9	0	*	Admittedly I did not pick up on this cue, and now I feel bad.  I have learned a lesson today.
t1_dsm086p	1	*	Yeah definitely, although ig could be counter-intuitive because it might also get a larger following for third party voting just as much as democratic voting. Which honestly I would NOT mind.

t1_dsm86y2	1	*	His villain soundtrack is great but we can't hear it from inside the show
t1_dsmmtsx	0	*	Ill be first to admit he is a troll. He is trolling you all so hard that he now lives in all of your heads rent free. He knows trolling works which is why he does it. 
t1_dsm1iyv	0	*	I hate how he and every other president handled North Korea. I probably hate Obama more for doing nothing.

t1_dslxvq1	1	*	Not even close. But thanks for the bs.
t1_dslxrpd	1	*	Lumpia is sooo tasty.
t1_dsm6sz2	0	*	That makes 0 sense though because every move he made was public the whole time he was campaigning and he was doing it hard.  The logic just isn't there.

t1_dslxyjn	1	*	Sure; Dick Durbin, Lindsey Graham, Tim Scott, Jeff Flake  4 senators, 3 of whom are republicans, who said that he said it. Meanwhile the best defense Trump has is two who do not recall and himself.

t1_dulh6sy	0	*	How do you implement universal cheeks without creating a gun registry? Nobody wants a gun registry
t1_dule104	1	*	Sounds like the kind of divisive nonsense a Russian troll would say...
t1_duld6yu	1	*	Its not even that they try to stop anything per say. They just stir the shit out of the pot 
t1_dtw507o	1	*	I understand that it's relevant and accurate. But really, sibling sex act viral video con does not read like a real sentence..
t1_dt6o6fj	0	*	It's nothing to do with human history. It's to do with the fact that they're all conscious animals. Making it about humans is what makes it ignorant 
t1_dt7sh2b	1	*	Notice I said killed humanely, not raised.  I also mentioned twice how poorly the animals are treated in factory farms.   Can you actually read?
t1_dv0pprh	0	*	If it's a nuclear armed rabid dog, you contain it, and wait for it to die of deydration, but you don't engage, and you certainly don't taunt it..

t1_dt9rgyi	0	*	That's fascinating, do you have sources for that?
t1_dt9tp2d	1	*	Do you even know what a feminist is defined as? Also, a mysogynist would mistake freedom of expression with harassment.

t1_du51yn3	0	*	I suppose it's okay for you to have days off and indulge in recreation because you're poor, right? 
t1_dsvva6e	0	*	I agree fully. It was with him that our country has been weakened and pushed down into the so called shameful peace process. We should have made a short process with the Kurds
t1_dswe1wr	0	*	No one really cares about that.   It's a long term strategic relationship and it won't change anytime soon. 
t1_dswbhfo	1	*	I'm pretty curious on Russia's response too.. considering one of their fighter jets were shot down by the Turkish military. And I don't think they're going to forget that

t1_dst49lv	1	*	I agree. 
t1_dstr7jr	1	*	You're saying as if the more powerful neighbor is innocent and has done nothing to hinder the development of the weaker neighbor. Hilarious
t1_dst7zpy	1	*	If that was the case why weren't they arrested by the troops that were standing right there. Actions speak louder than words.

t1_dtb0zwh	0	*	Yeah, they were very concentrated at the end of it.
t1_dtb8pbb	0	*	People have basic human rights and that includes not living in war zones under constant fear of death, in such situations immigration is a right and we should be accommodating.
t1_dtba2pq	0	*	And maybe that is because they have such strict border policy? Seems like a pretty good argument for it.
t1_dtau72v	1	*	We do that all the time here though?  Trump? The refugee crysis??
t1_dtbfbfs	1	*	Cool?
t1_dtd5yag	1	*	I understand the nuances of slavery vs servitude. I was asking for proof that the ancestors of European jews were ever enslaved.
t1_dtb8v6z	0	*	You seem like a cool guy. 
t1_dtb9u4n	1	*	You do know that they were not planning on sending them back to Eritrea, but instead other African countries?
t1_dtb7872	0	*	>Palestinians were expected to house, shelter and give up half their country  What country are you talking about? 
t1_dtgmtqc	1	*	Sure, but weren't there stories about how would be apostates got sent by whichever state religious department to counseling camps, where they'd be pressured hard to recant their apostasy?
t1_dtf1zxh	1	*	> i've never heard of a court system that has jurisdiction over some people but not others  Clearly you're not a member of a HOA.

t1_dv2e8np	0	*	Games aren't called bestsellers. And the US wouldn't restrict a game making fun of Trump. 
t1_dv1r9px	0	*	Oh yeah absolutely.  Agree with that entirely.  My only point is that blaming parents for the current state of microtransactions/loot boxes is a bit misguided. 
t1_dsc6wkx	0	*	Brutal secular dictator vs rebel groups of various degrees of Islamic extremism: Take your pick.
t1_ds3jyhw	1	*	Plus, the children didnt go for a bachelors degree, one of them became a dentist, a neither cheap nor quick field to achieve a degree / get into the work force.

t1_dsq6hge	0	*	I'm certain there are other hoaxes (which i don't think is necessarily the right word) that we don't know about. Either because nobody found out for sure, or it wasn't widely reported. 
t1_dsqj417	1	*	Yea they're all on social media by that age.  
t1_dsqiotb	0	*	She was probably black 
t1_dsq31to	1	*	Great, this thread has no-cut Puritans in here. The beings who inspired our sacred text CLEARLY intended for us to use our scissors on it!
t1_dsqhci7	1	*	The implication of the post was that a muslim did something malicious, that's enough for people to claim bigotry these days.

t1_dsq14qs	1	*	They found out within 24 hrs it was bullshit. That's fairly quick.
t1_dsrfomf	0	*	There are many attacks in America that are caused by Radical Christians. Example; Mass shootings. 
t1_dsq9trc	1	*	100% agree. People are so eager to put larger political messages onto what is almost certainly just an 11-year-old doing the same kind of dumb crap 11-year-olds do everywhere.
t1_dsqjftt	1	*	32,000 upvotes
t1_dsq0cdg	1	*	No.  That would only embold them, and the public, to embrace and tolerate their religious customs.
t1_dsq96wb	1	*	>  I'm to the point where I assume they're a hoax until proven otherwise.   Or in other less inflammatory words, innocent until proven guilty. 
t1_dsq19he	1	*	Canadian here. This is sensationalized bullshit.
t1_dsqfgf6	0	*	If that was in the US, they may have grounds to sue.
t1_dsq6xri	1	*	No, these articles where a big story comes out as fake gives Reddit a hard-on.  They almost always reach the top 10 of the front page.
t1_dsq9bdo	1	*	Plenty of that too. But that's still a part of intentional disinformation. 
t1_dsqb92c	1	*	You WOULD be a person who takes that a *white man* almost got lynched defending a black man from To Kill A Mockingbird.   (Nevermind the mob was there for the black man)
t1_dsq5yjl	0	*	Straight up cry for attention, perhaps.  Gotta hold the parents accountable.
t1_dsqf7q8	0	*	Liar.
t1_dsq9l5a	0	*	You don't understand the definition of a LIE.

t1_dsqsd9z	1	*	Shawinigan Strangler for life.
t1_dsqe1qx	1	*	Organizations feeding off the us vs them mentality. I mean makes for a good headline, gets clicks of course they'd pick it up without verification.
t1_dsqay7x	0	*	But wait a minute.  Why do you have the Quebec city mosque attack listed?    It happened.  It was motivated by far right hatred against Muslims.  
t1_dsqbeuz	0	*	Which would have resulted in countless other articles stating PM DOES NOT CARE ABOUT CHILD ASSAULTED IN CITY STREET
t1_dsr2530	1	*	the story fit all the narratives for a good old fashioned case of outrage. Initially I was one of those people but the more I read into it the less sympathetic I became

t1_dsq4cur	1	*	Luckily we all still have the option of reserving judgement by not posting at all.
t1_dsqjxp3	0	*	Who considers her a champion? I only heard of her once during the women's march and then just now, she seems pretty irrelevant outside of Twitter (which I avoid).
t1_dsqt15q	1	*	Yup. You would probably get called a Trump supporter or white supremacist. Rational thought is not a hallmark of either extreme side of the political spectrum.
t1_dsqk6uh	1	*	I think most people just have them on for background noise
t1_dsqbae1	1	*	>The hoaxes clearly outnumber any actual attacks.   What methodology are you using to get to that conclusion? Is it just how you feel?
t1_dsqk5ba	1	*	It can be both...
t1_dsrqw77	1	*	I don't think you quite agree with my meaning. It's religion in general combined with economic conditions and perceived or real displacement or oppression.
t1_dsq8bbz	1	*	And he looked like Edward Scissor Hands, but Asian ...
t1_dsq6cbg	1	*	I mean, he did and he didn't. I'm not going to get my door kicked in for criticizing Islam online, this is not the UK yet. 
t1_dsq1mxf	0	*	She's not being charged because you can't charge a child under 12 with a any crimes in Canada.  
t1_dsq2d5a	1	*	I think he is talking about how Trudeau is vocal about human rights. Until it is politically or personally inconvenient.
t1_dsq1p1s	1	*	Didn't know this one. It fits.
t1_dsqbqtk	0	*	>  she was just looking for attention,   Or get away from it, ie explaining why she wasn't wearing it.
t1_dsq56ds	0	*	Didnt they pull To Kill a Mockingbird from schools because it was too offensive?   Edit: yeah, it was pulled in a Mississippi school district because it makes people uncomfortable
t1_dsqxm24	1	*	not when thats most of what consumes people time and headspace.
t1_dsqf7tx	1	*	A+ typo

t1_dsqcuhj	0	*	was this the antifa girl who got punched in the face and became known as moldylocks?
t1_dsqd3lw	0	*	Trump doesn't believe in the Central Park Five hate crime hoax. That's pretty damn ignorant. 
t1_dsqh6xr	1	*	bruh my toque never comes off
t1_dsqaxap	0	*	> They were at a protest and ended up getting arrested and a shitty news station figured out they were a sex worker and posted her real name  Youre friends with Moldylocks?  
t1_dsqb7za	1	*	And you're right, she shouldn't have and will face consequences.  Doesn't mean she did it for religious reasons, on some mission for Muslim sympathy lol.
t1_dsq6e3g	0	*	It's a pretty narrow line to define what was a false claim and something slightly out of proportion though, tough call.
t1_dsq612h	1	*	The same statement applies though - this woman was not a representative of all social justice warriors (which is not a cohesive or organized group in any case), her actions don't speak for me.
t1_dsqcepu	1	*	I'll try to look them up but I recall an example with some Swastika Trump graffiti being traced back to a Trump supporter. I'm not really sure what the hell to search to find this stuff though.
t1_dsqyehx	1	*	Reverse hate crime
t1_dsqbz99	1	*	Can't blame the kid, no one will go for that.  I know, the parents put her up to it!
t1_dsqc2im	0	*	Um because it was a lie made up to make it seem like there's a problem going on with Islamophobia?
t1_dsq4tvm	1	*	Yup, no one said that. This one sure didn't.
t1_dsqj1nt	1	*	Err on the side of caution vs face the media backlash and community stirr. He chose to err. 
t1_dsqnl8o	0	*	Depends on the economy. If it's even remotely stable he wins.
t1_dsq9tbl	0	*	Wait. I didnt read anything about disbelieve the accused. AFAIK, there was no accused. Am I lacking facts here?
t1_dsqfio2	1	*	Not even skill oriented, reporters these days seem to blatantly lack basic logic. Same goes for politicians, if you ask me.
t1_dsq600i	1	*	Have you ever considered the fact that 11 year olds lie for attention?
t1_dsq2xvh	1	*	So therefore there aren't any real issues? 
t1_dsrb4n2	1	*	>Fuck reddit is wretchedly, wretchedly stupid.  *people.  It's not like only Reddit falls for treating allegedly and reportedly as true. Almost everyone does that.
t1_dsq3x7n	1	*	The truth be damned for far too many if a story fits their worldview. And that is true for those on all sides of a story. 
t1_dsq605s	1	*	Thank you for the clarification. Left wingers believe false claims that serve their purposes. Right wingers make false claims that serve their purposes. Interesting distinction.
t1_dsq2fp1	1	*	People say the same shit about the U.S too bud. Not where I'm from....trust me! Type shit. I guarantee you somebody with a different.... perspective than you may have a different outlook.
t1_dsq40p3	0	*	Comments like this expose that you are a bigot dude. 
t1_dsqcbgi	1	*	The parents could also have Trump Derangement Syndrome. Also a possibility.
t1_dsq11zm	1	*	No problem, Truth will then just go on disability and gain 300 pounds eating ice cream on his sofa while he goes brain dead from daytime TV.
t1_dsqc25h	0	*	Ahh ok. So it was a family brawl that she got in the middle of and when police came everyone said it was white ppl. Is that the story there?

t1_dt2zq5s	0	*	That is an average 'save' rate though. Roughly 1 in 3 to 4 people survive in hospital cardiac arrests.
t1_dt36hyc	1	*	The sad thing is you make a really good point but its gets lost because you unnecessarily made it about race. 
t1_dt4c12i	1	*	One more guess. It's not like it's that hard to keep track of who's working with which patients, which emergencies happen, etc.
t1_dt3dx1a	1	*	Damn, never heard of him, thanks.
t1_dtzrxn7	0	*	Who said anything about war?  Weak troll is weak.

t1_dtn6f7q	1	*	Well, yeah. It may not be widely supported, but he believe the world has been duped.
t1_dtn6dut	0	*	It is, but for all the 'superior' thinking lunatics, there are some that actually dig for evidence.
t1_dtno7tv	1	*	Thankfully no civilized country's government's intelligence agency would do that!

t1_dt47f0r	1	*	Smoking anything causes lung cancer. I think you're right though, the smell of weed doesn't linger and stick like cig smoke does.
t1_dt5gc4p	0	*	I agree. I saw a kid waiting for a stop sign to turn green. Then he drive five under the posted limit.
t1_dt4pq4c	1	*	Tbf, I wouldn't want anyone smoking anything inside my property (if I had rentals) due to the smells and  fire risk. However if you are baking a batch, go crazy and invite me :)
t1_dt42mx3	0	*	Weed smell carries over a logn way. If my neighbour smokes a cig in his backyard I don't smell it. When he smokes weed I have to deal with the stink that stays a long ass time.
t1_dt4kc45	0	*	Tobacco smells sweet, in my opinion.  A *bad* sweet, but still sweet.  Pot smells like rotting cabbage and skunk carcass. In my opinion.
t1_dt54y4m	0	*	LOL... sure... It's not quite as bad as cigs. but it still stains everything and the smell infiltrates everything the same way cigs do...
t1_dt56ig4	1	*	If these supposed annoyed neighbours aren't complaining yet, why would they start to complain once it's legal?
t1_dt42cfw	0	*	Fair enough, I was just trying to rationalise their thinking. 
t1_dt4ornj	0	*	They will have to do what many of us cigar smokers in urban environments do. Go to a private lounge or bar that allows smoking indoors. It's not a hard problem to fix.

t1_dsk3dk8	1	*	Poor native Americans, they suffered the most.
t1_dsjkmqx	1	*	Perhaps, but denying war crimes and whitewashing it away is its own sin. And the current generation DOES engage in it.

t1_dsjkggm	1	*	They conscript people in occupied countries, that's how they get more manpower.
t1_dsk7n5l	0	*	Mostly, because they are much more ethnically diverse than SK, China, Japan. Those 3 populations consist of dominate ethnic group (Korean, Chinese, Japanese).
t1_dsjbpc7	0	*	No, you didn't. Not even a **cent**.
t1_dskh92y	1	*	Abe's faction, Nippon Kaigi, has a policy of making it clear domestically that their apologies are insincere. This is because they are nationalists.

t1_dsdij89	1	*	Yes. You did.  You just didn't want to call attention to the gaping hole in your argument.   All I did was extrapolate a fact out of your opinion.
t1_ds8s2uc	0	*	No worries. I don't patronize businesses that don't offer a human experience.

t1_ds8jpw2	1	*	No one forces me to do anything....but there are plenty of people who really don't have that choice. Work or starve/freeze.
t1_ds9l2c8	0	*	The employers did delay the wage hike for years, which is why it's so steep.
t1_ds8uieh	1	*	Profit margins and total profits are different things.

t1_dtd3na9	1	*	Hes probably not a billionaire, and what wealth he does have comes from others investing his inheritance for him.
t1_dtd3d7j	0	*	Pretty sure that's not a basic fact of science 
t1_dtdz4gu	1	*	> It always boggles my mind as how he became a billionaire  Inheritance. Actually most people suspect he's worth less than the money he got for free.
t1_dtdmu72	1	*	Were you even alive for that? Current science refines theories over time. That doesn't mean our current working theory doesn't fit the data we have.
t1_dtd1e5f	0	*	Thank you for saying this. Also they were saying it was non-negotiable for the US. 
t1_dtd20kj	1	*	Pretty sure nobody denies it's happening, but the debate is how quickly it's happening and how much of an impact humanity actually has on it.

t1_dsrctx7	0	*	I doubt you will find many doctors in developed countries who back cirumcision if it isn't neccessary for medical reasons. Also, religion is a really bad excuse for harming people.

t1_dt8z5jb	1	*	So how about then we create a deal that favors women in highest echelons, but at the average and lower levels like most of us here men get an advantage? It's not all or nothing. You can do both.
t1_dt9vyer	0	*	Maybe that's something that happens in other countries. But in England our tests are marked anonymously by external examiners (they get a candiate number, not a name).
t1_dsjs6wm	1	*	Cold, but that's exactly how it would go down.

t1_dun87lq	0	*	Fuck this planet. 
t1_duidjnd	1	*	The last person that claimed that ended up admitting that 10,000 of the richest families got hit by them, after he did research. Where is your information coming from, and how is it different?
t1_duiaogt	1	*	Stupid people elect alike people. That's Democracy's hidden fault.
t1_dui166z	0	*	I didn't say they were alike I said they do important work with their money. Musk is referenced because he is developing new technology with his money which we will all benefit from in the long run.
t1_duk0iyc	0	*	All I saw from Dems is more and more taxes on the middle class.
t1_dui8haj	1	*	How come?
t1_duibn4x	0	*	What do you think is the difference between 2% for a household making 200k and 2% for a household worth 200m is? And where is the tax burden shifting when you make this cut?
t1_dui93u9	1	*	100 Booooooo Bitch  75 Yeeeaaah Bitch
t1_dui6dmd	0	*	Short term capital gains *are* taxed as income, and at your highest marginal rate. 
t1_dui9mi0	1	*	He is making up numbers. But I've sold to the fed.  They have to spend that budget and they don't care about price in that mode.  They're extremely wasteful with our tax dollars.
t1_duid4mt	1	*	His vice is Monopoly? 
t1_dui49au	1	*	snoochie boochies
t1_duie5ez	1	*	Wow. I like how you went straight for an insult. Very mature.   Would you care to explain how much of your income I'm entitled to? I mean, 'that's what taxes are for', right?
t1_dui860o	0	*	Depends where you draw the line of upper middle class, and rich. The top 1% pay over 40% of federal income taxes.
t1_dui7umo	1	*	Anyone doing well by working the system ought to be more responsible for upholding said system.
t1_duieo94	0	*	Good to hear that .5 of these 540 people are doing it to buy cool shit rather than as a game to see how much personal wealth they can absorb off the back of hundreds of millions of workers, I guess?

t1_dui7pqi	1	*	Instead we're getting cuts to education and a $25 billion dollar wall.
t1_duiapvr	1	*	And what do you have to say about the economic gains after that ridiculous rate dropped? Dont forget that those rates ended, and our econony has grown the most from the 50s onwards
t1_dui95ie	1	*	that's a funny joke.
t1_dui8yv0	1	*	Whats unfair is the estate tax your kids would be hit with.
t1_dui81f0	1	*	Vote out Republicans and we might be able to see some changes. 
t1_duibxpg	0	*	We make 160k a year and drive 10 year old used Toyotas. If you think making 200k a year with a kid and a house by a major city gives you new Mercedes money you are living in a dream world.

t1_duib8np	1	*	The Trump's of the world
t1_dui811k	0	*	Simply increasing taxes on the rich will not work. They already use loopholes to avoid paying as much in tax as they can, what's to stop them from avoiding paying more?
t1_dui8pfl	0	*	Solve that with a continuous curve for tax rate. Then we can stratify the rich, the wealthy, the filthy rich, and the megawealthy without creating a ton of tax brackets.
t1_duie090	1	*	I don't disagree.   Your problem is that you have to convince everyone else that they need to reduce your tax load. (Because they 'need' something.)
t1_dui7re9	0	*	They are different systems . political donations  /bribery does not become money for the government to use.

t1_dui4skz	0	*	You don't have any evidence that Bill did anything illegal or unethical in the process of running Microsoft, do you?  Yet, you will sit there and accuse him of wrongdoing.
t1_dui9svf	0	*	Good point, but if everyone did the 'right' thing for humanity all the time, there would be no need for taxes or government.
t1_duian87	1	*	> they still shouldn't be paying the same tax rate as someone making $10 million/year.  why? 
t1_duifvj8	1	*	You are the 1%
t1_duibqpm	0	*	Its going to be rough when the owners of his company get to keep their tax cuts but your dads expire. 
t1_dui9qdr	1	*	Yes, a bigger percentage than they currently pay, how is that redundant?
t1_duiaui1	1	*	Hello? Yes, This is dog.
t1_duikjai	0	*	If 47% of the country is homeless and dying then we should all just move to North Korea.  You first.

t1_duicw0r	0	*	Im not saying they dont do other things with money. And good for them for doing that.  Im saying raising taxes substantially on NEW billionaires makes it harder for people to even become billionaires

t1_duzesxj	1	*	What about creating jobs? I don't particularly agree with it, but politicians seem to love creating jobs, and an infrastructure project like this would be the perfect candidate for such busywork
t1_duz773s	1	*	well, the trick is to relocate them to a new home...

t1_duz4124	0	*	Considering Romania is ahead of us I am not too proud of that.  
t1_duzhbdy	1	*	Yeah, China recently opened a new train line into Tibet.  It is literally a continuous tunnel through the mountains for like 800 miles.  Shit is mind boggling.
t1_duzol22	1	*	But to have people coming out of poverty must mean they are being paid more than peanuts? So it is a contradiction.
t1_duzax6f	1	*	Not necessarily. China invests in infrastructure with a huge focus on growing GDP.  In some cases, they do this whether or not these cities and buildings will be used in the future.
t1_duzdkef	1	*	Dont go to Germany. One of the leading nations in Europe and we have shit internet. Even behind Spain.  And dont even talk about fiber optic, thats still a dream for most

t1_dsnkxde	0	*	...  They're moving it to other densely populated areas that are densely populated by other Chinese.  This is Beijing improving by offloading its pollution to other cities in the country.

t1_dska0e6	0	*	And storms move hundreds of miles in days; what's your point?
t1_dtmb22v	0	*	My point is that this type of ideology exists in high places in western countries too. It just so happens that Indonesia has a number of hardline Muslims in government. 
t1_dudwjgi	0	*	You can't just keep voting until you get the result you wanted.
t1_dudwi1k	1	*	If a majority of people no longer want it, then it would be like taking a shit of democracy to continue without another vote.
t1_dt1x9kl	0	*	Poor Turkey. And Erdogans a saint. 
t1_du86ute	0	*	No. Israel's aid is for Israel's security. More money to Jordan and Egypt doesn't help Israel in any way.
t1_du83h03	1	*	And you are who to decide that?
t1_du9ainc	1	*	You're right. Israel is just a better country. I guess what they say is correct. Israel truly is a bastion of social and economic freedom in an otherwise horrible region. 
t1_du856ev	1	*	Americans are not a real people and never have been. The self proclamed Americans are west english

t1_dsezslm	1	*	I'm sure there are sides. 
t1_dsew3wm	0	*	The issue I see with that is, not all meals can have the meat separate as it's part of the dish.
t1_dsfbujg	0	*	It's pretty oppressive to force kids to eat a certain type of meat. People here defending this extremist policy just hate Muslims and Jews, but of course they'll never have the guts to admit that.

t1_dsgczdi	1	*	I don't think there should be a vegetarian option, or *any* option.  School lunches are intended for the very poor.   Very poor people don't get to be fussy about free food from the government.

t1_dtd7nyr	1	*	Lowering portions of meat also is a good start. 80 grams is really enough. Eathing smaller animals like chicken is also way less harmfull than cow for example.

t1_dtcu3b3	1	*	Yeah they will teach you how to be a pretentious, self righteous, snobby asshole. 
t1_dtdb7yh	1	*	Made the switch last year... It was actually much easier than I thought it would be. If you're interested, send me a message and I can tell you more about what we did. 
t1_dtcrtg1	0	*	People dont want to give up anything if its difficult, and eating sustainably is truly near impossible given how far along we are. 
t1_dthxbqw	1	*	No, thank YOU! For harnessing the power that lies in the simple choice of eating a certain type of meal thrice a day!

t1_dtf5yro	0	*	Dont dig a deep whole, we both know when things started to happen. Its like calling humans hitler because hitler was human.

t1_dv2mhip	0	*	Oh I agree there should be a punishment, a heavier one in this case to, but that fails to address the bigger issue of rehabilitation.

t1_duqvd7g	0	*	In alot cases prison isn't that bad, it's not like they're being tortured.  Humans can get accustomed to alot.  How can you say death is easier but an innocent person should rot?  Doesn't make sense.
t1_durolz0	1	*	I was with you until the last sentence. That sentiment isn't any more noble than being pro-death penalty.

t1_du9m4ik	0	*	What is it about 50 year dictatorships that you love so much? Why is it about bombing civilian airliners and nightclubs and sponsoring terrorism that's so appealing to you?
t1_dsnp8sv	1	*	> helping our U.S. Citizens first and foremost?  Ahh yes, because the tax bill, repealing obamacare and constant cuts to multiple social programs are all about helping US citizens, right?
t1_dslfza4	0	*	Him = the president means he won. Calling his base troglodyte or basket of deplorable whatever other nonsense contributed to him winning, as well.
t1_dsm9q3r	1	*	Oh I'm not concluding Trump is a pig purely based on this. I mean it's not like I hadn't previously noticed. This is just part of his usual pattern.
t1_dsl4fsy	0	*	It's a disappointing observation
t1_dsmc65t	1	*	> To be fair, this was something that was said in a private meeting that ended up getting leaked.  This is the biggest part of the alleged comments that makes so many people not think much of it. 
t1_dsl0i2f	1	*	I dont think anyones excusing Bill getting a BJ in the Oval Office either. 
t1_dslvls0	1	*	But it was in private though... does that not kind of excuse it? This was just a leaked private statement...
t1_dslccl4	1	*	Nice strawman. 
t1_dslum0l	1	*	Which parts? I keep hearing chicken shit Republicans tell me I'm wrong, but not about what. I think it's got something to do with hurt feelings... sorry your president is shit.
t1_dslt2w4	0	*	When I was growing up the saying was sticks and stones and now somehow it's mutated into dont say factually correct information unless you can do it in a way that doesn't offend anyone. Fucking hell.
t1_dskyu6w	0	*	Obviously, but since Hillary called it right, in effect they are just celebrating being terrible people.
t1_dsl8rvk	1	*	Actually the second amendment is for the purpose of an on-demand militia against any foreign invasion.

t1_dsm0haw	1	*	Are you saying we have some system for identifying high quality individuals from shithole countries right now--i.e. that does *not* fly in the face of merit-based immigration?
t1_dsm0djr	1	*	So be insulted.  Shithole countries.  Yep.
t1_dslwzu2	0	*	I highly doubt /u/Doktorsoviet has private meetings that have the effect of influencing foreign policy. So no, it absolutely does not fucking matter that this was private. 
t1_dsmss7m	1	*	But immigration from these countries is not from the average people in those countries. It's the educated skilled laborers who are able to immigrate, why shouldn't we take them?
t1_dsljmf8	1	*	There is no distinction between public and private comments when you're the president of the US.
t1_du2abfc	1	*	Israel routinely attacks iran???  Proof please and how often is routine?

t1_dupq3tf	0	*	I think you're being downvoted but you're absolutely correct. (interested parties should look at historian Stephen Kotkin's work) 
t1_dupx1vx	1	*	To be fair The Gambia had had only two leaders up to that point.
t1_dupyyfq	0	*	So you hand wave away the brutality of colonialism as winning and then expect to be taken seriously when talking about racism.   K.
t1_dupzn9f	1	*	They would probably still do it anyways, so you might as well leave them an eternal flipping of the bird. 
t1_duq3xvs	1	*	The same amount of time weve been in America 
t1_dupodte	1	*	Ok... Most of the people who died of starvation were intentionally starved because they were a minority.

t1_dtryqz6	0	*	One of the only compensations for an Irish Summer is the 10pm sunset.  Some years we even get a day with sunshine and it's glorious.
t1_dtshnjs	0	*	Extra light at the end of the day when people are not at work so that they can go walk their dog and sit in the park etc.   Is that reason valid enough for you?  
t1_dtsltv1	1	*	Northern Canada? Thats almost the extremes of sunset in New Brunswick! Latest is closer to 10 but it isnt dark until after 11
t1_dtt2w47	1	*	Also have each timezone randomize which direction their zone goes.
t1_dtsr8v4	1	*	Plus, theyre fucking elderly. What are they having to get up for?  Just stay in bed an extra hour or so and ease into the change over several days. 
t1_dtrgxkh	1	*	In winter it is normal time, in summer it is daylight savings time. So it is during summer that you actually change the clocks.  So hence no difference in winter with or without DST.
t1_dtsbnop	0	*	> You think you have an extra hour of daylight in the evening purely because you go to bed an hour earlier than usual.  Later, not earlier.

t1_dtrkjq0	0	*	I strive to only think about time as an Epoch value.
t1_dtrrl46	0	*	Its nice but I commute in the pitch black. But getting back home after work, and having 2-3 hours of sun is pretty rad. 
t1_dts7b2o	1	*	Starting work in the dark and having light creep up during my shift made time seem like it was passing faster, so I'm all for that
t1_ds6i3uk	1	*	In that context, it means that a strong majority (2/3) should have backed Brexit for it to happen.
t1_ds72fc3	0	*	Sure but he's a commie
t1_ds6cppe	1	*	except for the constant push for another referendum...
t1_ds6ar28	1	*	> If it was reversed in a second referendum do we then have a third as a decider?  Strictly speaking the so-called 'second referendum' would actually be the third and therefore 'the decider'
t1_ds6pgw6	1	*	Would you reverse the decision to go to Iraq?
t1_ds6eeet	1	*	Brexit was like Arsenal vs Tottenham, Corbyn supporting the referee.
t1_ds6pl2o	1	*	And not a single shred of evidence, everytime you people are pressed over your bullshit claims you disappear, funny that. Go on, arrest him and take him to court.
t1_dtcvqrw	1	*	The last administration set the stage by not even trying to address the issue during 8 years of testing.
t1_dtdxdom	1	*	>It will be very interesting to see how Palestine equation will be come into consideration..  The same way the Egyptians solved it by separating it from their bilateral peace deal.

t1_dtcdt98	1	*	Oh I meant him.
t1_ducl6yd	0	*	Wow, and a weak proto-fascist at that

t1_dsf1ok2	1	*	More than likely it is individuals that happen to be Russian and not Russia that is selling them oil. The Kremlin only has so much control over its oligarchs. 
t1_dt9r286	0	*	Critical thinking and logic is incredibly important skills to possess today, do these countries *want* their future voters to be more easily duped or is the test poorly written?
t1_dtaa821	1	*	Cognitive dissonance is a powerful phenomenon 
t1_dt9pt5b	0	*	It's almost as if every source has biases, and the only way to be informed is to take in news from as many sources as possible, and evaluate them comparatively.
t1_dt91kz5	0	*	Good journalism is dead. The facts are not completely investigated and while there is some biased in all, America's is extremely bad. 
t1_dt93iiq	1	*	I'm referencing most data validation methods.   Of course the terminology is different across platforms, I assume.

t1_ds8bbbe	1	*	Uhh China isn't near the US in wealth or power
t1_ds6jayy	0	*	I don't know how they'd rule. It's not like there's a constitution to compare the law too. 
t1_ds660ro	1	*	Well. Life in prison is already pretty damn hard punishment. Although there's a chance of them releasing him anyway.
t1_ds5x385	0	*	I don't even think this merits a response.

t1_dtp3wfu	0	*	Oh shut up 
t1_dtpgfjo	1	*	I'm asking because it's an al-Qaeda affiliated jihadist group that has claimed responsibility. Are we saying those people represent Syria?

t1_dtpnjj4	0	*	If that's what makes a country evil then all superpowers are evil. Including probably the country you live in
t1_dtoqv7l	1	*	Yes. People who ejected from a crippled aircraft can't be attacked. Paratroopers, however, are fair game.  https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v2_rul_rule48
t1_dtp20p5	1	*	You need a new catch phrase.

t1_duc7xg2	0	*	When they're first released, yeah. These have been on the market for decades and were already often used together
t1_dubdrpp	1	*	Couldn't care less...I hate when people say that phrase wrong. 
t1_ds96fvw	1	*	Technically Mexico has always been a first world country as a US ally.
t1_dtdfq0h	0	*	ok every article about Russia is propaganda and Putin's totally fine. got it!
t1_dtdas41	1	*	>  it's going to be bad for the media  and good for the people, the media has never been trust worthy, I pray that the time where more people see that is coming
t1_dtda4wr	1	*	Could be a psychological tactic. People may become apathetic when they think since the information is out there someone else will surely handle it. 
t1_dtdxok4	1	*	Which part confused you?
t1_ds1x95q	1	*	What an intelligent response. 
t1_ds2i7oi	1	*	Yeah, waste taxpayer money keeping a guy alive just because it makes you feel better. That'll certainly help. 
t1_ds1i3px	1	*	Nooo, stone him a bit every day so he suffers more!
t1_ds1uw0k	1	*	Man, 56 rocks so far and every single one has managed to hit you in the balls. What are the odds?
t1_ds1yip1	0	*	According to what? The Quran?
t1_ds2oz9u	1	*	> while they flay him alive.  You missed that bit, I think!
t1_ds2blu9	1	*	This argument is out dated sorry
t1_dtncnf5	1	*	Heard he'd racked up 100 offences and 30 odd court appearances over 30 years. Police reckoned he'd been radicalised over six weeks.
t1_dtnacyc	1	*	He did have quite a few previous convictions, or at least he spent quite a lot of time being dragged up in front of a judge. I think this was the tipping point.
t1_dtob7sr	1	*	By the time he's in his 80's he will already have been moved into some kind of medical unit/carw home. He won't get out.
t1_dtncg3p	0	*	pretty sure you can just copy/post the paragraph from the acticle with the important sections.
t1_dtn0tkf	0	*	Dude, I said Christians because thats what the article is about.  I wasnt saying they are worse than Muslims.   Take a deep breath   It makes sense, Muhammad was a military conquerer
t1_dtmvijr	1	*	I hope when I clean out my couch I'll find a decent amount of change. 
t1_dtmmq03	0	*	Do you want a hug m8
t1_dto7vmj	1	*	Help poor people!? But thats Commulism! /s

t1_dt4oc9s	1	*	ok... and you didn't prove anything?
t1_dta17p6	0	*	Lol. In reality, he's been mired in unpopularity his whole term. Day 1 started out 50/50 and disapproval skyrocketed immediately after. He hasn't even begun to turn it around.
t1_dthz6h9	0	*	Chances are whoever retaliates has much better intel than tweets and a Reuters report. 
t1_dti4u76	1	*	Want to know how I know you didn't read the article?
t1_dtxgxi0	0	*	Well, it sounds third world, but it isn't. I know coz I myself am from a third world country. I would rather live in the US than a real third world country. 
t1_dtxffxi	0	*	Close to slavery? Call it what it is. Being forced to work for 25 cents day is slavery and it's literally enshrined in the US constitution.
t1_dsuz8mz	1	*	Leasehold is a specific legal term in the UK. Essentially you own the property outright but you rent the land it's built in. This is as opposed to freehold where you own the property and the land
t1_du1kca0	1	*	Proof?  What law is Israel breaking?
t1_du0ixn4	0	*	When providing an actual parallel between tactics, no.  The article isn't calling anyone Nazis, but if a questionable policy decision has parallels it's not unreasonable to point them out. 
t1_du883ee	0	*	Because you should. It's a nice game.
t1_duqvk6z	0	*	Because i thought exactly the same thing when i read the quote. It is really a sign of complete failure of society. 
t1_durdasr	1	*	I didn't say the NRA was going anywhere.  I simply said we will see in response to whether this will hurt the NRA or help the NRA. 
t1_dur1dfo	1	*	Ur right 
t1_dur7num	0	*	NRA promotes the gun culture. Which is the root of all this gun violence in America. Why is America the only country where this regularly happens?
t1_dur0nvd	1	*	They can't shoot the messenger, they're anti gun. 
t1_duoydm7	0	*	Your username is hostile.
t1_dsu7jd7	1	*	Hours. 30 *hours* of looking for a missing semicolon.  Especially if the code was still semantically valid after that.
t1_dsthfth	1	*	Unlike all other animals in nature, we can conceptualise alternate means of killing that reduce harm and suffering. 
t1_dsub6ix	1	*	thankfully not all. Sure the animal lives a better life, but it still dies in the end. its life is still needlessly ended
t1_dsv6kb6	1	*	Groovy. Great recommendation!
t1_dsuetyd	1	*	Filming to expose mistreatment of animals or other wrongdoing should definitely be allowed. That outweighs anyone's privacy.
t1_dstdj3t	0	*	Compartmentalization. No one is really fully aware of the full effect of the company they work for. I think it's the whole no drop of water believes it's the cause of the flood idea.
t1_dstopul	1	*	People only choose to be free market when they're in charge of the market. They are anti-regulation.
t1_dstsqz6	0	*	I am not sure what you mean, German sausages are pretty tasty...
t1_dstkp8l	0	*	Try harder.
t1_dsthssh	1	*	To a degree - you shouldn't clear pick an area - some need to be left to fruit so we have a crop next year.
t1_dtk76wm	0	*	My thieves?! My behalf?!  I didn't claim to be a Palestinian?    Stop demolishing schools isnt a difficult demand to make for anybody. Its something you just DONT do.
t1_dui55em	1	*	Yes but sensible Pakistanis like me are boring. Might even make Pakistanis seem like normal people. Doesn't get ad revenue or upvotes.   So don't mind us
t1_dsypm0w	1	*	Would you agree it's more likely than not that the mother of a 12 year old has been previously notified of the health risks of her daughter's obesity?

t1_dushj2t	1	*	But the wall is going to be built
t1_dusi72a	0	*	He also signed the Mulford act as governor and increased taxes three times as president. Seems like a democrat to me
t1_dut1llz	1	*	lol
t1_dusrlkf	1	*	Replied booblieooblie
t1_dusu77l	1	*	Can I have your tax refund from this year?  Since you dont care about it.
t1_duu85hq	1	*	Not unlike draining the swamp (moving goalposts much?) or locking her up (always a convenient diversion). The bullshit detector was off the charts from the get-go, but they will never smell it.
t1_dusl9l1	1	*	He got plenty of folks up here to vote against their self-interest, but I don't see him making another country pay against their self-interest.
t1_duspf5z	0	*	You're right, we have nothing to fear. Therefore no reason for me to actually take the time to vote, right? Cuz other people will *definitely* vote him out for me
t1_dusk7vn	1	*	Yeah because invading our third biggest trading partner is totally a realistic idea.  
t1_dustbdd	1	*	Well he did put it in quotes so he gets a pass.
t1_dusot8l	1	*	He's had two government shutdowns and had to rely on Democratic votes to reopen it. This is with his party in control of everything.  
t1_dutt7eq	1	*	Yo Quiero Taco Bell. Am I doing this right?
t1_dush7c2	0	*	Let's give a gun to the students! Everyone gets a clear backpack and a Glock. You don't want them to be sitting ducks, do you?
t1_dushgh0	1	*	Well, Mexico could at least offer to pay for painting the wall, but only if Trump promises to make it so big that it could be seen from Trump Tower.
t1_duumenm	0	*	Now youre thinking in Mexican 
t1_dusjsme	0	*	I can see Russia from the white house. 
t1_dusmea1	1	*	Its not magic. Theres cause and effect. Lets hear an actual idea of how we could FORCE a sovereign nation to pay for something we want that it doesnt.
t1_dusjfpw	1	*	It's like a kick in the testes.
t1_dusgrc5	0	*	We don't spend that money just to help Mexico. It serves domestic goals as well. Additionally, US foreign aid to Mexico is worth a tiny fraction of the cost of the wall. 
t1_dutwirt	1	*	I wasn't aware Deutsche Bank was a Russian bank
t1_dusja57	1	*	Im picturing all of this as banter between Dr. Evil and his son Scott 
t1_dusiuqd	1	*	:-/ all too true
t1_dusl9mk	0	*	Yeah. If you have money and grew up in a community of other money-having people. Obviously.  But I mean, Reagan specifically? Honestly? That's your guy?
t1_dusnmgx	1	*	Do right leaning news articles even exist on this topic? If not, you can't blame the bot for not presenting them.    
t1_dusjip0	1	*	The top 10 countries pro Obama in the chart are all top 10 most developed nations in the world. I'm surprised to see Argentina in the bottom.
t1_dusjs8a	0	*	Ah deportation, the homeophaty of politics! Take away substance of a country, to increase its overall effectiveness. 
t1_dusgj8s	1	*	That's music to a Republican's ears!

t1_dush6tw	0	*	I will charge them more to do business here and take that money to build the wall  It makes complete sense and seems like a bulletproof idea... If your 5.
t1_duspqyx	1	*	> no matter how hard he begs and cries and whines and pouts  But that's his favorite bargaining tactic!

t1_dwt20tn	1	*	Rule 34?
t1_dutzsno	0	*	As I said, maybe in a Trump supporter's eye that's an effective wall. Thank you for proving my point.  
t1_dusr5cr	1	*	93% approval in the CPAC poll though. :D
t1_dusprx4	1	*	And what does it do? Brings out a 2L of diet coke instead of a can
t1_dusme39	1	*	His base isn't going to change their mind what rest of US needs to do is show up and vote against him. Let him keep his 33% while rest of sane America votes a different leader who is not trump 
t1_dusrpmu	1	*	He's already managed to get so much. Its a testament to how broken the system is.
t1_duslicg	0	*	I was ready for a change in the political system and in my opinion she would not be the person to accomplish that.
t1_dusqugo	1	*	Agreed, I think it's one of the best bots Reddit has.  Hmm...I'm wondering if the same function can be found in a browser extension instead.
t1_dusym7p	1	*	I don't know what that has to do with my comment. My only point was that Mexico should also want the wall
t1_dusjtnb	0	*	This, times *infinity*
t1_duspywn	1	*	U0001f3fb
t1_dusidcu	0	*	Before his second-term when he was crippled by Alzheimer's but still running for President?  Reagan and Trump had similar speech patterns, too. Even down to the overuse of word filler and repetition.
t1_dut4mw4	0	*	There is nothing wrong with compromise if it's within reason, being stubborn just to be stubborn isn't helping anyone.

t1_dusk5lv	1	*	Ooh ooh let me guess!
t1_dusi1xd	1	*	And how does the inaction of a field branch in Miami have anything to do with one of the most thorough investigations in years directly led by the US Special Counsel?
t1_dut34nz	1	*	Well we can start roasting you [**here**](https://snoopsnoo.com/u/locuester). I see that your account is quite the old fart for Reddit. 
t1_dut1z8i	1	*	Yes but something that will be blasted in full view on all the media, except for Fox and other right wing propaganda media of course. 
t1_dut27zd	0	*	Its nit because of your thnicity its because you are sending American dollars out the door. Your welcome to just not do it then you wont pay. 
t1_dusopq9	1	*	You are very right.
t1_duskdwz	1	*	In other words, for people who actually think, Americans will still end up footing the bill. Anyone who denies this is an idiot. 
t1_dusj658	1	*	I wouldn't be as against a virtual wall.  high res + IR cameras, ground penetrating radar (or other underground sensors) and normal radar.  Building a real wall is stupid.
t1_duspvra	0	*	Naw. I'm not corrupt or rich enough
t1_dusjkai	0	*	Right, so it will be paid for with U.S. taxpayer funds. Just like I said.
t1_dusi7fw	1	*	I wonder how much it'd cost to infest the Rio Grande with some form of mutant flying piranha. Probably be cheaper than a wall still

t1_dusmvqf	1	*	I believe they ban any bots besides the ones they create as they get brigaded often 
t1_dusjucr	1	*	You're right. Hilary was very unlikable. Yet she still got more votes than Trump. That just goes to show how much more unlikable he is.
t1_dusj6w6	0	*	i did not know that is what that meant 
t1_dute527	1	*	Ah! Pronoun trouble!
t1_dusr0xc	0	*	You have no answers.   Doesn't that worry you? That you're choosing to act like an insane person? Claiming things with no reference to reality? It would bother me. 
t1_duslemt	1	*	Because then he'd be less likely to tax corporations more, regulate corporations more, raise the minimum wage, and expand workers rights.
t1_dusskyn	1	*	The wall is to keep us in folks. If we framed it to the Mexicans like that theyd have it finished by Thursday.

t1_dusnedp	1	*	> there is no recourse for Trump to make Mexico pay for it  Around $25 billion a year is wired to Mexico as remittances. A 3% tax on that would be $750 million a year. Why would that not work?
t1_dusqm65	0	*	I highly doubt Trump will change his mind about the wall in 2020, also you're smoking crack if you think it's even possible to abolish the 2nd Amendment, LOL.

t1_ducw7vi	1	*	Sorta. We just discovered that ruling a foreign body can be hard and exspensive. Now instead of owning the land and the people we tend to just want acess to their resources on our terms.

t1_dtws6bu	1	*	And then that happened and I thought that I had wandered into bizzaroland, that nothing could be stranger.   Little did I know...little did I know. 
t1_dtwmcgy	1	*	I mean, you said Bibi is the most deserving for it, so giving an example of a different person that they believe is more deserving seems like a valid comment to me.
t1_dtwppwd	0	*	Oren Hazan is generally considered an embarrassment within the Likud, and he was just suspended from the Knesset, so I doubt it. Miri Regev, on the other hand... 
t1_dtwtiwp	1	*	And an end-run around the establishment clause to use tax dollars to support religious fundamentalists.
t1_dtwb46y	1	*	Maybe I'm just not that into warrior fetishism.
t1_dtwsffz	1	*	But if they invested in their own country how would they ever afford to dig tunnels to get into Israel and stab people??
t1_dtwxmf2	0	*	Almost like theyre occupied by Israel and have been stuck in a diplomatic/economic limbo for a lifetime. How do you stabilize and encourage development when youre in the situation Palestine is in?
t1_dtwnpn0	0	*	One comment was enough. 
t1_dtwlgfr	1	*	Yeah, no, buddy. Look into wtf netanyahu has been doing with his settlements and see how nazi germany took over areas in Czechia and Poland :)
t1_dtjoqbu	1	*	wow....
t1_dtj7jha	1	*	I wouldn't even say just implementation, but rather market adoption. If you can get the market to adopt a subpar product, you will still make millions.
t1_duxiphq	0	*	Why should just men have that right in society? Equality! 
t1_dsuv2km	0	*	And how would a mental institute handle an individual like this differently??

t1_dusengh	1	*	What do you think
t1_duso10s	0	*	To add to your point, the money made from those licenses is what they use to fund their conservation projects in the first place. The foreigners who are authorized to be there aren't the problem.
t1_dtiirn0	1	*	No, it was because it was comically over the top propaganda, are you meeting with Christians!? while being tortured. It was like an email forward from grandma.
t1_dupeste	0	*	Which means they still have to do trials at FDA levels if they want to sell in the US.
t1_duqnae4	1	*	I use uBlock Origin and Privacy Badger on Firefox, didn't have a single add on that site.

t1_dsqrykn	1	*	All of them.
t1_dsqfumi	0	*	Representative democracies don't always do a good job of representing the voice of the people. It's a work in progress across the world.

t1_dsqf48e	0	*	You know you're advocating murder, right?
t1_dsq3h6e	1	*	I'm an asshole just for pointing out FACTS IN PRINT?! Why were the olive trees allowed to grow so tall if the Israelis wanted to burn them down the whole time?
t1_dsq2whv	0	*	Lol. Settlers destroy olive trees every year.
t1_dsqtq51	0	*	That doesn't apply, like, at all.

t1_dsqcz84	0	*	Quick question how well can you tell a 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 , 21, 22 etc ... year old apart? Cause when I buy booze people can't tell that I am 30 lol

t1_dstneex	1	*	No I think you really care lmao
t1_dstm7ud	0	*	Megacorps don't own the MSM. The MSM is just a bunch of nice friendly people who get together to make sure the world is informed. They definitely have nothing to gain from pushing an agenda.
t1_dsu4cwg	1	*	Plus he used campaign funds to bribe a porn star.
t1_dszlp73	0	*	Maybe. Is executive privilege constitutional or is that something that congress could feasibly amend rather easily? 
t1_dseqdg7	1	*	Could be worse I suppose, lack of oxygen you get stupid, feel drunkish and then pass out.
t1_dsfq1ka	1	*	I suppose I should have phrased it as a few hundred rich families can't control hundreds of millions of noncompliant people
t1_dsg1jyb	1	*	This report suggests there could be a mass extinction event in the oceans in our lifetimes, if you claim there are more dire credible predictions i'd like to see them.
t1_dtjbrt6	0	*	Not as strong of an argument when you consider that continental Europe (EU zone) is in the middle of the longest uninterrupted period of peace since the Pax Romana.
t1_dtj4tmr	0	*	Lmao Mohomad? Go read a book, son.
t1_dtkrgtr	1	*	That's some fucking grade A sarcasm, I like it.

t1_dv2mxfb	1	*	Thanks! 
t1_dsgi2ti	0	*	They were organized around a politics of resentment, nothing more. Trump promised them winning and punishing people they didnt like. No policies, just resentment. 
t1_dsggxv0	0	*	who's that?
t1_dsgiae5	1	*	With so much going on in the trump administration I can almost understand why someone can have no time for politics
t1_dsgiaef	1	*	Obama did face criticism though.  Also, fyi, he's no longer president.
t1_dsgh77e	0	*	I can't breathe this is too funny!! 
t1_dsge26b	1	*	They could have video court transcripts and he would still says sources. 
t1_dsgplt9	1	*	Nope. Sorry.
t1_dsgjo64	1	*	Facts like what? 
t1_dsghppb	1	*	It's not a contradiction. Unsustainability is not a contradiction. Capitalism (unregulated) is unsustainable.
t1_dsgzs9d	0	*	Many early liberals supported unions and believed capitalism required powerful regulations to keep business in line. 
t1_dsgprtj	0	*	As an American with DB accounts I feel somehow doubly ashamed and skeeved out. 
t1_dshc2p9	1	*	It happens in every country 
t1_dsgjlu5	1	*	I could be wrong but I don't think Royal Commissions can send people to gaol.  Their job is to determine what is broken in the system and make recommendations to fix it.
t1_dsgiqak	1	*	t_dumpster poster calling anything else echo chamber. It's more sad than anything.
t1_dsgiz4v	1	*	What the public is *supposed to do* is to assume the worst of them and keep them out of office.
t1_dsgexle	1	*	Well...that or Russia. 
t1_dshajmb	1	*	> It's true that anti-trust authorities have truly fucked up  They did exactly what they were told to do when they were put there by the corporations that captured their regulatory agencies. 
t1_dsgfkko	0	*	Nah, I'm saying this article is bad journalism, trying so hard to create a scandal out of nothing.
t1_dsk3d8c	0	*	Yes but all I'm saying is your statement on a libertarian defending the decision is false , a libertarian wouldn't lol 
t1_dsgemcb	1	*	Just like you bet that Trump wouldn't win the presidency?
t1_dsggczv	0	*	True though. The waiver is the same obama gave and is just ongoing. Saying it's unique to Trump and linking it to his debt is fake news.
t1_dsgjran	1	*	No problems... Just ask fox news to air the trailer for purge
t1_dsgh6kv	1	*	Damn loch ness monster
t1_dsgiroi	1	*	And the script is going to be flipped again after Trump's done and a Democrat is in.   Both sides do it, it's wrong, but that's the way the political climate is. 
t1_dsgfzge	0	*	wtf? nationalizing companies? Hope you're joking. 
t1_dsh7uvs	1	*	When you have money, everything is allowed :/  I hate this country...

t1_dsgv3l5	0	*	Congratulations! You back someone who is just as corrupt as all the other people. Did you ever believe in draining the swamp, or was that just a slogan?
t1_dsh6n5l	1	*	To be a capitalist you have to actually have Capital. That means 90% of Americans are not actually capitalists, but wanna-be capitalists.
t1_dsgwppg	1	*	Oh, I think it's probably possible; it's just that our politicians don't want to open that can of worms because it would be career/political/literal suicide
t1_dsgpd3g	1	*	Is that where the word 'stock market' comes from?
t1_dsh38e4	1	*	As a lifelong American, I'm even more baffled than you are.
t1_dsgnls0	0	*	Let's hope people don't excuse it because the guy who isn't the president did it.
t1_dsgizy6	1	*	Exactly right.
t1_dsigl26	1	*	Berlin...the ass end of Germany. GDP would actually go up if Berlin would be removed from Germany. The city is so dysfunctional it is hilarious.
t1_dshfle6	1	*	Supposedly a man with a golden toilet is the every day man that people could relate to.
t1_dsgfdn3	0	*	Russia?
t1_dsgylzi	0	*	Did Trump?
t1_dsgqt6d	1	*	A lot of Americans are right there with you! 
t1_dsgqotv	1	*	I'll go one better: if you think a ton of common people will *unite* to take down the government, one that isn't being actively oppressive, you've totally lost it.
t1_dsgemeg	0	*	We've got to make memes.
t1_dsh77gn	1	*	True. But we can all agree donny is a shit show on steroids 
t1_dsgi1zd	0	*	This is the biggest problem, facts do not matter to these idiots, its all about how it makes them feel.   Emotions are much easier to manipulate.
t1_dsgxrbl	0	*	So, Obama didn't personally owe them money like Trump does. Thanks for clarifying that Trump is corrupt as fuck.
t1_dsgt55n	1	*	This guy is right.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPnFeFa1NXQ  0:45
t1_dsgsofr	0	*	He provided a 104-page financial disclosure - what pertinent financial information is missing?
t1_dsh0hig	1	*	Do you actually believe that's the whole reason for this? What's it like to immediately and wholeheartedly accept and guzzle down everything you want to believe as fact?
t1_dsggtbk	1	*	[2017 was the worst year for job creation since 2011.](https://thinkprogress.org/trump-job-boom-actually-the-fewest-number-of-jobs-created-in-the-last-6-years-0465cb9b54c2/)
t1_dsgfe4d	1	*	He doesn't own hotel chains.   He puts his name on them and gets licensing fees. 
t1_dsgixcl	1	*	Perfect description!

t1_dsgo2lv	1	*	But theyll get an extra $1000 this year so they can buy another gun. 
t1_dus1vc7	1	*	> But the link doesn't link to the Amnesty report they're supposedly quoting. It just links to Amnesty's 2017 Human Rights page.  The link leads to the human rights report they mention in the article.
t1_dudog78	0	*	You think the US took out each and every single one of them? That would be a war crime.   And the majority of the fighters were probably not russian mercenaries, but SAA.
t1_dudcroc	1	*	> volunteer to help build huts for amazon tribes or build wells in Africa.  lol I guess its  the least you can do after raping their nations or any resources they own.
t1_ducyyov	1	*	When he said Tyrannosaur, I only pictured the tiny arms.
t1_ducvgjq	1	*	Mercs can work for the Syrian Government. The Syrian government has a decent amount of money. I know it's hard to wrap the micro brain around that concept, but I'm sure you can do it.
t1_ducjmvd	0	*	Yes there were for example Academi, G4S and Foreign Legion
t1_dudar99	1	*	Not really, they also have support from naive people who don't actually understand what these Kurdish groups actually want. 
t1_dsbnrwf	0	*	The article names the surgeons in the arrest also  >five Kosovan doctors were sentenced to up to eight years in prison for organ trafficking.
t1_dsbmehp	0	*	This is another symptom of internet culture. Reminds me of two instances of postal workers killing people. Now the term, Going postal has a place in our language. 
t1_dsbmxl4	1	*	Goblins.
t1_dsciqvz	1	*	so far zero people have provided the numbers I requested that back up they are the most involved in organ trafficking.

t1_dsecr5d	0	*	Over the last year, he seems to not be a little bitch. I think he will continue to do his job.
t1_dsehjxv	0	*	What the fuck are you rambling about
t1_dsee83n	1	*	Reportedly Trump mainly hired him because of the Mad Dog nickname.    Its further proof of the blind squirrel effect.  
t1_dse3jlk	1	*	It's a comment making fun of the reddits favorite punching bag, of course it's going to be upvoted
t1_dsegma3	1	*	They also counterfeit
t1_dselcv0	0	*	That's a fair point, but I don't see what can be done about that militarily. They aren't going to give up their nuclear program entirely because nobody has any leverage on them (unlike Iran).
t1_dsec2ij	1	*	Trump's the easy part, it's surviving afterwards that tricky.
t1_dsfyeyu	0	*	Everything is racist to you, it's just convenient for you because how weak you are. I'm actually Jamaican. Feel stupid yet?
t1_dseg3on	1	*	Plus there would be a massive drive to develop and modernise the north.
t1_dsedg6g	0	*	Ah, I was trying to figure out how Papua New Guinea worked into all of this. 
t1_dskd1fk	0	*	If it fell from low orbit, there is no tech to recover. Just rapidly dispersing micro-fragments.
t1_dulq3vw	1	*	Same in Italy, but we were undisciplined and we didn't give a fuck about Christ.
t1_dul5y2d	0	*	I suppose the article wants us to think it was a class on catholicism, without ever saying it. Comparitive religion doesn't sound bad. Even if you don't believe. 
t1_dumi8mn	0	*	We have this in my area of the US, they are promptly ignored at all ages.
t1_dulscbt	1	*	The comp (Greenhills college). Came second last in national rankings the year I left and has maintained its excellence ever since. 
t1_dulbuob	1	*	If anything, learning about multiple religions helps against indoctrination, as it gives person perspective an ability to choose.
t1_dulq63c	1	*	In Ireland, bible bashing means very devout, and bible thumping isn't a phrase one hears.
t1_dulmpjl	0	*	I don't think you know what religion is. What you mentioned is politics, not religion. Religion should teach the cornerstones of each religion, not how it's misused. 
t1_dulbx1j	1	*	Fairly peaceful from what I've heard 
t1_dulnec0	1	*	Yeah so it's kinda like not really news
t1_dulh0ir	0	*	In Ireland it's really not taken very seriously at all. It hardly ever comes up in conversation and you would never be asked if you go to Mass unless it was your Nana. 
t1_dt7c6xa	0	*	Leadership? I'd imagine you'd either join up, run stuff and enjoy the good life or escape and bum around until you got assassinated in an airport.
t1_dsplfrt	1	*	They likely used the suggested title feature when posting which sometimes pulls the first paragraph of the article as well and lumps it together.
t1_dulupcn	0	*	It makes it alot less dramatic.
t1_dsd9j8v	0	*	Half of the coverage is true. So that means half is false. Well I would not trust anyone that's half truthful so I do not believe.
t1_dsyz7id	0	*	Its not propaganda at all. Theyre not withholding it for their own benefit. 
t1_dtn0irn	1	*	Way to go. Tearing apart a gish gallop like that takes some patience. Well done. 
t1_dulkmgc	1	*	So all Palestinians are terrorists, then. 
t1_dulidmc	1	*	LOL so trees can be Jews now??xDDD
t1_dumf9ug	1	*	Indeed... I'm not sure if we are not paying for the debacle of the Basslink cut?
t1_dukdt5j	1	*	Perhaps they should hold another successful referendum on leaving Australia and becoming an independent country.
t1_dsdb62m	0	*	Yeah? And what does that have to do with the topic of this thread?
t1_dsdgqvu	0	*	But than he d be already boss of teh world
t1_dsfj49e	0	*	Regime change is the only option. 
t1_dsdju0h	0	*	This guy is definitely German. 
t1_dsnzdx9	1	*	First article was them calling the whole thing racist not the word shithole. The second one was getting an ambassador to explain the president. 
t1_dv1xhog	0	*	You need to understand that Trump voters care more about perceived victories than actual benefits. 
t1_dv2o3l6	0	*	its probably the shit that fails fda

t1_dv39e2c	0	*	Canada wasn't it's own country back then.  Either 1840 or 1867 depending on what perspective you take, but most commonly thought to be independent as of British North America Act of 1867.
t1_dv343xo	1	*	He was elected because the other choice was Hillary.    I dont think that many people voted FOR him, they just voted AGAINST her.
t1_dtis4ri	1	*	I don't see anything claiming it's 300% worse. Could you quote the exact text here?
t1_du03api	1	*	What the cow?
t1_dujkaah	1	*	Yep they are worse.
t1_dujcx1p	1	*	You mean the Chinese Australia?
t1_dtf0165	0	*	Why have a notepad open slowly typing Hello YouTube if you can make Text to Speech say it for you?
t1_dtf65mj	1	*	Youre right yeah. I meant a bolt or something similar. 
t1_dtwjd6z	1	*	Yes, he or she should stop sugar coating it already.

t1_dsw4n8t	1	*	I disagree. With doping you have to consider people guilty until innocent when they leave tests. It's fairly common response to missed tests by WADA.   
t1_dscry15	1	*	That story about the pens isn't entirely accurate.  https://www.snopes.com/business/genius/spacepen.asp
t1_dscrawc	1	*	This is a sign from God that we should abandon science, as it can fall back down on us and kill our most beloved leaders.

t1_duggr8s	1	*	...Nope
t1_dug8ori	0	*	It's far easier to punish an individual than nation states.
t1_dtc1azl	1	*	Because getting scientific experiments to one of the Lagrange points is a massive pain in the ass is much more expensive than getting them to LEO.
t1_dtbbask	1	*	I like how fast it went from an organization is hoping to keep funding for the ISS until 2028 to NASA is asking for funds through 2028 to ISS is expected to stay in use through 2028.
t1_dtbb4ki	1	*	If you want documented and sourced theses, worldnews comment sections really arent your best bet. There are subs that scientifically discuss this stuff

t1_dtmtg72	0	*	Right, you're making your decision not on what will make you, or everyone else better off overall, but on the fact that it makes you feel good to stick it to drug users

t1_du9cdoj	1	*	+aids
t1_duou8ps	1	*	You summed that up quite well indeed.
t1_duq1u79	1	*	Russia defended Syria from US funded rebels. I bet China would defend NK. A strike on NK is a threat to Chinese national security, and a huge loss of face for Xi. 
t1_du852x8	1	*	I'm not 'attacking' Trudeau. I'm just sharing my opinion that he's an asshole.

t1_dsdxd5q	0	*	I just can't understand how someone can have that much lust for money to pocket tons of funds intended to save lives. Like how fucked in the head do you have to be . 
t1_dsebxeq	1	*	Your wrong.  Cheney's Halliburton assets were immature stock options.  They could not be sold, they weren't in a trust, and he knew that by making Halliburton wealthy he was making himself wealthy.
t1_dsdq124	1	*	You should throw in a *wink *wink too.
t1_dse79qb	1	*	Well if they didn't talk about her, they'd have nothing else to criticize, they can't talk bad about Trump. It's just a scapegoat thing. The usual propaganda.
t1_dsdn4uc	0	*	But the Clinton one bothers you more than the Trump one, doesn't it?   Otherwise, why make the remark?

t1_duf719l	0	*	That's not what he is saying. He is actually right in his entire argument there, which makes it worse. He saw it happen and allowed it. 
t1_dui9x1r	1	*	You should see how quick Youtube was able to take down videos of the nipple slip last night. When they want to, they can stop things.
t1_dufe4jt	1	*	Your account hasn't commented on anything other than Russian posts and other highly politicized topics, and always in a very inflammatory fashion.   Just thought I'd point that out. Seems odd. 
t1_duf6o56	1	*	still doesn't hold a candle to the damage citizens united did
t1_duf1nya	1	*	Same trejectory as AOL. 
t1_dufer4z	1	*	The statement he made was aimed at calming and reassuring shareholders and nothing else. All Facebook cares about is the stockprice.

t1_duficfw	1	*	The fact that this has >100 upvotes and gold tells a lot about this subreddit.
t1_dufydjl	0	*	Cling to guns and allow children to be slaughtered daily.  Melodramatic partisan bullshit.
t1_dug63jd	1	*	If it bleeds, it leads has been part of the culture since the 1800s. Nothing has changed.

t1_dstkhxr	0	*	Clones. 
t1_dsu03iq	1	*	That doesn't sound very Canadian. 
t1_dstng5u	0	*	What? The olympics is all about sports. The integrity of the sport is always the first concern. Any symbolism about international unity comes second.

t1_dstufhi	1	*	He's like a actual piece of crap Dr Manhattan. 
t1_dstmqh5	1	*	All Im saying is that participation in the Olympics is a privilege. So it seems like SK is easing up the pressure. 
t1_dsun7ey	1	*	Also Sydney 2000. As a Sydneysider I remember it being a big thing.   Some info here: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Unification_Flag

t1_dstub5r	1	*	Canada won't meet the Korean team though - they are only in it because they are the host country and we aren't in the same pool for the preliminaries.  They won't make it to the finals to face Canada.

t1_dv0jfo9	0	*	Mondoweiss is a propaganda site run by a bunch of morons. Netanyahu cannot a a US citizen now because Israeli law prohibits any politician from holding dual citizenship.

t1_dsdcpfq	0	*	Not to the US, but it is a credible MAD threat to South Korea.  Even without a nuke, they have enough artillery and rockets that they could level Seoul and Busan within minutes of war starting.
t1_dse16l2	0	*	The Wikipedia link on Hyon Song-wol says that the dancer execution never happened.

t1_dsrchkj	1	*	Im actually really surprised that the top comment is NOT about how our air cleaner is way bigger. Considering how phallic these look. 
t1_dsqy8qr	1	*	The smog problem in that area of China (Beijing, Xian) isn't all due to human pollution. It's also located in a valley so smog just hangs there and you have dusts blowing in from the Gobi Desert.
t1_dsrhu7m	1	*	The best in the world, frankly. The best air you'll ever breathe.
t1_dsrjw35	0	*	What a Dick!
t1_dsr3l51	1	*	Nah, I think threatening Trump ego would be enough.

t1_dsr1mbp	1	*	A start is a start nonetheless. 
t1_dsr1ukb	1	*	Fake cities to attract investors? Country that produces 60% of all goods in the world needs to make fake cities to attract investors? You are not skeptical, you are in denial.
t1_dssig2k	0	*	What exactly makes up the pollution? How much of it is toxic? It is so much better to not have airborne particulate.
t1_dsr2fru	1	*	Salt Lake City here. Our pollution levels are a serious concern. 
t1_dsrdz1u	1	*	I believe that was in reference to a different tower. This one was primarily powered by heat rise resulting from greenhousing air at ground level.
t1_dsrkk92	1	*	According to someone buried in the comments, it could be but it'd be expensive and not really that good. I dunno, not an expert.
t1_dss992t	1	*	They can just build a giant air filter. Problem solved.

t1_dsr1olq	1	*	Give it time it should warm up
t1_dsrhjbr	0	*	I've never heard of a giant outdoor air filter before. Can you tell me where to look for info on that?
t1_dsr7ojt	1	*	The problem is that he would say that without actually doing anything to make the air cleaner. 
t1_dsr3n7y	1	*	What about a giant chimney (IE space elevator) that blasts atmospheric gasses into space at escape velocity for a few hundred years?
t1_dsrf89z	1	*	Your vocabulary is stunning, sir. I could listen to this delicate prose all day. 
t1_dsr5p7p	1	*	That's Brit or Aussie for trash. This was my first thought. Who buys the filters and what's that gonna cost?
t1_dss1fwk	1	*	Semantics. OP asked if he should be concerned and as PragProg said there is no reason there is no reason to be concerned at all.
t1_dsrs7a5	1	*	Yup like a Loony Tunes cartoon episode of Ralph E Wolf and Sam Sheepdog -Punching the Clock  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kerUbfOQTW0

t1_dsmfae3	1	*	Also the one country on the Wikipedia page that has more prisoners per 100,000 doesn't even have 100,000 people. 
t1_dtug07l	0	*	I don't see many Indonesians in full face covering.
t1_dtu353a	0	*	Isn't it counter-intuitive to assume that a woman who is *forced* to cover her face would become free by banning it? More likely she'd be even less free to go outside.
t1_dtvb2zf	1	*	Dont be so sure, its a fairly common occurrence to see someone wearing one if these while driving where i live
t1_dtu27f9	0	*	Thats why I added a second, modern example. Try to keep up.
t1_dtua0ev	0	*	Apparently not much considering the prevalence of modest dress codes in society. 
t1_dtuyh99	1	*	Why is there just a photo of a wall for this article?
t1_dtvu01b	1	*	**Nah**
t1_dtu52rn	0	*	This has always seemed like a shallow viewpoint on nature vs nurture. Some people are raised by terrible people and it influences their behavior, so why would types of dress be any different?
t1_dtvhdut	1	*	I know you joke but fuck man Amazon has everything.
t1_dtv5q2n	1	*	You would think
t1_dtudjv2	1	*	You're right, it's Yemen.
t1_dtvcvif	0	*	Two types of people want to cover their faces,  1: Famous people.  2: Deformed people.

t1_dtvcjmg	1	*	Those veils are actually pretty warm. I mean, they probably keep you cool if it's 40 xb0C outside with no clouds but in a cooler climate they act like a ski mask.

t1_duwymxk	0	*	But then how would Miami build any new condo buildings?  
t1_duxozyv	1	*	How does a oxy high compare to heroin from the needle?
t1_ds4nyjw	1	*	Exactly. There should be a rule, that soldiers should be shot first before shooting.
t1_ds3zubd	0	*	India is also a democracy. Something makes  me feel very uneasy about having a dictatorship eventually becoming the largest economy in the world. We should be fostering closer ties with India.
t1_ds45vr2	1	*	Great.  You should have a talk with those Representatives and ask them to kill hundreds of high paying jobs in their district.  I'm sure that will go well.  
t1_ds41g0r	1	*	I think they mean perhaps a regional rival. India and China have a lot of contested border area, so it makes sense for China to surreptitiously try and weaken India furtherm
t1_ds44wk6	1	*	> And how do those supplies get from the Arabian Peninsula to Afghanistan?  Which makes the recent protests in Iran a little too coincidental.
t1_ds467a5	1	*	A low GDP doesn't necessarily translate to lack of tech, or strength. Just that there's income disparity and lot of poor people. Just something to keep in mind when you quote economists.  
t1_ds4i5ei	1	*	Here's a reddit tip, friend. Don't bother arguing with anyone whose stance is pro China/Russia/Disney. It's not worth the effort.
t1_ds556ke	1	*	I dont care if Trump did good or bad. I just want PR to get the help it needs.

t1_du47g7n	0	*	I would humbly suggest enjoying sunshine after 6pm is not the same as pooping in the potty
t1_du4leiz	0	*	Calling people you don't agree idiots only re-enforces their ideology and makes them less likely to care about what you say. You're not helping.
t1_du4418j	0	*	You've got to be joking, who cares about the coldness of salty water?
t1_du48tmx	1	*	DSL probably haven't done anything to change the time except allow women to make their partners late for work. 
t1_du4cv9d	1	*	I doubt it has anything to do with how old you are. Also, just because you think you are unaffected doesn't mean you actually are.
t1_du4bk1y	0	*	> 8 months out of the year  7 months. Winter time is November, December, January, February, March.

t1_du6g03x	0	*	> Maybe Id be for it if the DST was in winter and actually useful.  I'd be for year round dst. Giving people more daylight after work could be nice.  
t1_du4gkfw	0	*	Oh wow, I checked and you're right: IST means Irish Standard Time rather than Irish Summer Time.
t1_du55cf1	1	*	The amount of sunlight does change, but it doesn't have anything to do with DST.  It's basically on account of where the rotational axis of the Earth is pointing.
t1_du4brpl	0	*	Varies depending upon location.  Pitch black in November for me at around 1630-1700.
t1_du4bm9s	1	*	> Fahrenheit is superior to Celsius for the average ~~person~~ American.
t1_du4ipls	1	*	See, I'm the bizarre one that would prefer standard Time. I'm always more comfortable after sunset. Honestly, sometimes I feel like nothing worthwhile has happened while the sun was up. 
t1_du4db7y	0	*	Something is not better just because you grew up with it and are surrounded by similar taught people. If you've ever worked with both, you instantly realise the metric system is far superior.

t1_dt6935t	1	*	Idk. 
t1_dtcpf9l	0	*	There is a reason why people from these parts of the world see America as the terrorists.  How can we claim the moral high ground when our government kills more innocents than ISIS?

t1_ds89yc8	1	*	Does that work on you? If I follow you around and mock you all day on Reddit would that make you leave?   It's just shit logic, that's not how people work.

t1_dsga3w9	1	*	It's not legally meaningful, so it's something political and would influence my vote if it were relevant.  Fortunately or unfortunately it is not.
t1_dsh74u5	1	*	Only 2 of these are primary sources (13, 14) the rest are secondary sources that are arguably politically biased and are to a large degree, opinion pieces.  Kudos for the effort - better than most.

t1_ds5zp4e	1	*	Actually, they have been under-hyping the 3 for a long time now, as the demand is too high. They try to get people to order the S or X instead.

t1_dud3anv	1	*	antidepressants are addictive. It's why they're controlled by a prescription. 
t1_dudlasi	0	*	Depends. If you mean by all the sugar and calories then it's easily comparable to a flavored drink at Starbucks

t1_dtsq0az	0	*	Holy fuck how many people did you reply with this garbage article to?  He told a cop he wanted to burn their house down. Dude is so fucking dumb he's less of a danger inside jail.
t1_dtso1ww	1	*	It's not relevant to this article.  We know Russia isn't the only place on Earth it happens.  You are trying to deflect and distract instead of discussing the actual issue.  
t1_dtshtca	0	*	Because it fucking happend THREE YEARS AGO as you yourself have stated? That's the difference between NEWS and HISTORY, you see?
t1_dtsnv9i	0	*	Most of the popular site are banned, but you obviously can't ban all porn. You can acess pornhub via your vkontakte account (russian facebook) tho.

t1_dtt8a5y	1	*	Being convicted doesn't imply being jailed either. The vast majority are convicted to pay a fine.
t1_dttcexf	0	*	What political activism? Dude was discussing about true races and sub races. It's called racism and is outlawed in majority of countries.

t1_dtn56fz	1	*	The memo doesn't say that. If you want to know what the memo says, you can read it now online. Or, you can just continue to make shit up and believe in it, like you did here.
t1_dtmzk65	1	*	Well said, and very incriminating. So much for the Scandal-Free presidency of Obama.
t1_dtmzuiy	1	*	Are you the same guy spamming this everywhere on /pol/ right now, it's pretty tiresome.
t1_dtn2wck	0	*	Welcome to political tribalism. If the memo put Trump in a bad light this would have rocketed to the top of r/all in a heartbeat.
t1_dtn5wfj	1	*	Considering the dossier wasn't the only evidence in the memo and the investigation started after the australian ambassador reported a member of the Trump campaign you say?
t1_dtn3k9u	0	*	Nobody denied they were correct, they were just stupid talking points. 
t1_dtn416j	1	*	> They paid for faked evidence.  No they didn't. 
t1_dtn2y25	1	*	No thats obstruction of justice. Also, its not treason its collusion.

t1_dt9rla0	0	*	So, more proof without proof. Oh well, not surprised.
t1_dt99din	1	*	Well, sort of.  If Trump is just their totally ignorant stooge he wouldn't have personally broken any laws.  Granted, that's not a great look for an executive either.
t1_dt9oulb	1	*	a MR.ROBOT  season about shit like this would be glorious 
t1_dt8pq16	1	*	At best Trump is a moron and at worst he's complicit/compromised.
t1_dt8wtm0	1	*	I think we all know the answer to that... :(
t1_dta3vx7	1	*	Look what's really important is if the boy was democrat or not 
t1_dt95il3	0	*	Because no matter what the truth is, it can be made to make him look bad (whether he deserves it or not). Politics is the art of spin.

t1_dtxk0oa	1	*	Im not sure!
t1_dsrfrva	0	*	Except that the vast majority of suicide attacks actually target muslim civilians or local law enforcement, so your argument is completely invalid.
t1_dsre5zm	1	*	We'll get right on that... as soon as white supremacists knock off their bullshit too
t1_dsrhyhb	0	*	It's really nothing new. People here have long accepted it.
t1_dsrbqng	1	*	Explaining isn't justifying. If you want to defeat your opponent you must know them better than they know themselves. It's your anti-intellectual mindset that needs to end.
t1_dsczv5k	1	*	> Ruptured Colon with a Blowj0b poured on top   Yeah, I'm not gonna google that ;).
t1_dsafjd2	1	*	And it took less than 45 minutes for r/t_d douchebros to infect this board with their assholery.

t1_dsatdox	1	*	That'd just move heat from the ice cubes into the surrounding environment :P
t1_dsak8jj	1	*	The article is giving a low estimate. The mean estimate is 70% (most ranges are between 50-85%).  
t1_dsaia5k	1	*	Wait what?
t1_dsab9l3	1	*	Oh, they know about the global reality. They don't give a fuck and if god told them to, they'd tell god to fuck off and laugh at him while they burn eternally in hell or something.
t1_dsawfs4	1	*	No my friend, demand is at record highs. Oil prices are low due to overproduction, largely due to US fracking. The government of the US isnt giving anything away.

t1_dsb0sbi	0	*	Or adopt and do the same thing. Or work with children and educate masses of them instead of spending all your resources on just one. 
t1_dsat41q	1	*	Not even close.  It's actually not that hard to counteract climate change.
t1_dsbmcir	1	*	The thing about democracy is that if you don't change the people's mind then they'll change the government. 
t1_dsamymh	0	*	Everything will be ELI5

t1_dsamq0q	0	*	Lots of dogs eat lots of meat which produces lots of CO2.
t1_dsahn1p	0	*	I'm pretty sure companies will jump on the opportunity to produce affordable CO2 scrubbers for indoor environments so we're pretty much secured.
t1_dsaqxgr	0	*	No, it's climate change now
t1_dsauxcb	1	*	OMG, we're literally heading towards idiocracy.
t1_dsahzhp	1	*	Yeah but, like, we're almost at the Usain Bolt stage of dying tho.
t1_dsacqmz	1	*	little island nations are too small to make a dent in the ocean ecosystems. It's the industrial scale fishing by the nations that have no trouble producing stuff on surface that drives the problem.

t1_duxaw3c	0	*	America only apologized for slavery 10 years ago and has paid *zero dollars* in restitution to *any* victims or their descendants. They could actually learn a thing or two from Japan in that regard.

t1_duyc5s9	0	*	technically, Japan did apologize. Although not as 'sincere' as Germany. They still apologized. 
t1_dtbirm0	0	*	My point was that anyone in the US is any position to condemn or call other countries names until we fix things here at home. That's not whataboutismism. That's about not being hypocritical dbags.

t1_dukc5vf	1	*	Adversarial interests are throwing all the criticism they can at the metaphorical wall and will use whatever (might) stick.
t1_dujv2km	0	*	I doubt it's even that high. Probably only about what half a dozen cruise missles would cost.
t1_duksqxh	1	*	Yes, I was not disagreeing with the comment, but rather continuing the conversation in a way, ridiculing Trump's use of that term.
t1_dukyz41	1	*	This would make it all worth it
t1_dukbodd	1	*	Game Of Dumb. 
t1_dulifie	1	*	You sir, /u/PoppinKREAM , you're so very much correct
t1_duke2mt	1	*	Edited. Better?
t1_du7jci5	1	*	For how much you guys bitch about your second amendment right youd think this is the situation for it?
t1_dv0b5lj	1	*	I hope he resigns so we get Mike insert meme Pence
t1_dtjp72e	1	*	I was really just responding to why these stories are news worthy but also saying it isn't exactly new or random. The comment was just meant to explain and provide examples.
t1_dtffkmc	0	*	Cold contacting is the term the news article used. It doesnt refer to the meeting that was set up, it was referring to the call Don Jr received from her to set the meeting up. 
t1_du1nc5s	1	*	PENCE CONFIRMED GAY Totally 
t1_du1ryk1	0	*	It makes everything cost more in Canada and makes it harder to get a full time job there as well
t1_du1m4g1	1	*	That's the longest spelling of Yes I've seen.
t1_du1qj5d	0	*	Oh damn, I didnt know that. I just assumed it was one of those bills that was proposed by two guys named Ryan (like Paul Ryan) and White (Ron White, idk) 
t1_du1tss4	1	*	Holy shit! Is this the extent of what he's done or is this just the tip of the iceberg?
t1_du1w9u1	0	*	Sounds like a dolphin hyperventilating 
t1_du1tow1	0	*	Pretty sure Christians historically vote Republican anyway. Not sure they needed much convincing to go against the party that they always are against.
t1_du1djlu	0	*	You think NK made overtures preceding the Olympics because Kim Jong Un has some noble view of the universality of sports? Its all about politics and optics, and furthering the regimes goals.
t1_du2pwcz	1	*	Oh, there are no yaks in Lithuania,   So set your mind at... ease. [\(Shit, that doesn't rhyme\)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bC07e7PReM)
t1_du1v6jp	1	*	The homosexuality isnt the insult.  The blatant hypocrisy is.
t1_du1uu7f	1	*	People like you need to die screaming.
t1_du1skho	1	*	I am pretty sure, I don't follow stuff like this much myself. It's a shame that somebody at such a high ranking position could be so shallow minded. 
t1_du1s8nx	1	*	Can confirm, as I live there. 
t1_du2btcl	1	*	He likes them as props, not people. Same as the NK dictators. 
t1_du2wpuq	0	*	Whats that?
t1_du1hy6z	0	*	Er.... You must not know much about the Phillipines. 
t1_du1sevk	1	*	You said it better than I could. Dude is awful. 
t1_du2bunh	1	*	He probably wouldn't give a fuck. He's politician, he stuck his finger in the air and changed his attitude with the rest of the people his age.
t1_du1jej2	1	*	Usually something really pervy like the republican senator caught giving BJs in the airport mens room.
t1_du1qz2y	1	*	Hitler supported athletes too. This is really stupid 
t1_du1qlmq	1	*	Huh, TIL. I was living in Indiana at the time and even the local word was that he supported it 
t1_du1sqb4	1	*	Yes, it is a [tautology](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tautology), but for me it's more than that. It's a mark of ignorance of the truth and a lack of education.
t1_du237x9	1	*	It makes me feel weird that I actually know what this is.
t1_du47jpe	0	*	It was for when he was in favor of keeping money in the budget for gay conversation therapy. You seriously didnt heart about that?
t1_du1rdyo	1	*	> he looks like he's about to pass legislation to outlaw the X-Men.  He looks like the comic version of [Stryker](https://comicsauthorityblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/10/god-loves-man-kills-3.jpg)
t1_du1ql8m	1	*	So yes 
t1_du2ecu0	1	*	Not gonna lie, if I had the spare money I know I would put random shit on billboards.
t1_du1ts67	1	*	Because drugs are bad, mmmkay?
t1_du26f3n	1	*	Lineage? How far back do you go?
t1_du1cpwb	0	*	Sorry I'm busy preparing for an event, I don't have time to care about internet bullshit right now. 
t1_du23prm	1	*	If all these issues weren't so damn serious, this would be hilarious in how stupid and backwards all these actions are. Thank you for writing this.
t1_du1oqsj	1	*	I plead guilty Your Honor.
t1_du25lyk	0	*	Thats assuming that Olympians have the same rate of gayness as the general population. It could be lower than average, or even higher than average
t1_du1xumt	1	*	Don't ask if they're gay, don't tell if you're gay.
t1_du1tc5r	1	*	>Lol, does he have to suck a dudes dick on live TV before you are appeased?  Well, he's a homophobic Christian... so frankly it's just a matter of time.
t1_du1o5t8	1	*	Clinton marched in a gay pride parade in 2000. Her being against same-sex marriage for political reasons is nowhere near on Pence's level.  
t1_du2tnmr	1	*	Lol did you seriously do a whatabout? Why not some emails too? No defense? Bring up Hillary! Because of course, if I despise trump and his admin then I must love Hillary! You got me! 
t1_du1ob5s	1	*	You're acting offended right now
t1_du34ea1	0	*	Then why even talk.
t1_du1rimi	1	*	No, its like deaf people opposing hearing potatoes being surgically implanted into deaf childrens heads. Neither work and both can instill false hope at best, and be irreparably damaging at worst. 
t1_du1tmue	0	*	What a prejudiced comment. 
t1_du1u7b9	1	*	simple. gay marriages don't produce children. 
t1_du1sg9q	1	*	Because you dont know what it means to him Yak of his life,  yak of his life Uuuuuuuuuh YYYEEEEEAAAAAH
t1_du1z4kz	0	*	Wtf are you talking about? There is no definition of what an Olympic athletes job is. The Olympics is way more than just a sports competition. 
t1_du25mui	0	*	I'm not a mind reader, I'm just someone with access to many public statements he's made. 
t1_du1sl3m	0	*	Not really anymore than your average Joe. There are a lot of homophobes. You only hear about the gay and bisexual ones because of the scandal.
t1_du1q23y	1	*	Youre the first Ive seen to put it in those words, and off that I agree completely. Wouldve helped if he didnt pull that shit in Indianapolis. 
t1_du1qa3s	0	*	Pence has a long and storied history of anti-gay legislation and financing.  The top comment atm details over five different things from his own website that he openly supports that are anti-lgbtq
t1_du1uiqc	1	*	Oh man, that is the perfect description of him. Wonder if he's a self-hating mutant
t1_du1rio7	1	*	Dicking over the host city economically decades after the event? 
t1_du1odg7	1	*	If shaking hands in public spaces avoids wars i have a bridge to sell you. All it does is rile up those that eventually fight those wars.
t1_du1grvz	0	*	What about Germany then? They recently legalized it as well.
t1_du29wmr	1	*	An example would be my English teacher. He passes very well, even though his mannerisms definitely make sense now, I just also justified it as him just being old. 
t1_du1u1j2	0	*	Statistically you are in 4 maybe 5% of places. If you were everywhere the human race would have a major birth rate issue.
t1_du21lkx	1	*	I'm pretty sure the rivers run full of Kopustu Sriuba!  http://www.geniuskitchen.com/recipe/lithuanian-cabbage-soup-kopustu-sriuba-144231  It's so good :D
t1_du2o3x8	1	*	it's like one of the three things that we're any good at so we try to care about it
t1_du1u3ir	1	*	Wrong kid died!
t1_du1h227	0	*	Being better than the worst doesn't make something good. That's literally a fallacy. And a popular one at that. 
t1_du1obtv	0	*	Great counter point. Wonderful discussion. 
t1_du23nkz	0	*	Just want to take this chance to mention that Reagan's administration *literally* laughed about gays dying of HIV/AIDS after being asked about it by a reporter.
t1_du1nijx	0	*	Im saying its a bullshit argument because no one is getting it. No matter how much you want to believe you are a victim
t1_du6e33s	1	*	Trust me Im well aware that they suck and we can't figure out gay rights. I just don't think we're the only still figuring it out.
t1_du1rkkp	1	*	He looks like a Nintendo 64 character
t1_du1cagu	0	*	And that washes away his entire political career how exactly?   Or are you one of those people who think holding a flag equates to acceptance and support? 
t1_du250n2	1	*	Hes a son of MOTHER
t1_dt9mk5c	1	*	Nutella is not the same in France and Germany, we have different bread so it wouldn't spread the same way. Very easy to verify !

t1_dtbmcgw	1	*	Example?
t1_dscqjir	0	*	> healthcare cost decreases  Other way around. Healthier people cost more (mostly due to end of life care).  Source: http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/05/health/05iht-obese.1.9748884.html
t1_dsbq01l	0	*	That is just not true.  If you eat nothing but vegetables you **will** get sick and have serious health problems.
t1_dsci342	1	*	Doesnt basic economics say that the company who does pass the subsidies onto consumers will be able to offer a lower price for their products and gain a competitive advantage? 
t1_dsboe61	0	*	Not necessarily. It will very much depend on their research and projections. They may decide it's best to keep the sugar and take the hit. Coca cola for example likely won't do anything differently. 
t1_dscf2bg	1	*	I don't care if someone wants to live an unhealthy life but as you said at the end, it bothers me when they make their kids unhealthy.
t1_dtmfy87	0	*	I've heard market cap is basically not real as far as dollars to dollars, so it wouldn't be a full 100b, but nothing disappeared. People got paid for their crypto.

t1_ds40ysz	1	*	Or Elie, MB 
t1_ds3v319	0	*	I feel like even many native species would have trouble recovering immediately from -50. Many animals are resilient sure but man would that weed out the weak.
t1_ds3r5zx	1	*	I live in the high desert and it was low 30s last night, its been colder as well.
t1_ds3ilea	0	*	Haha until a 10 mph wind hits you in the face and it feels like getting sand blasted. Wind chill temps have gotten into the -40-50s. Its been miserable. U0001f643

t1_dv5mtez	0	*	You mean are actually shit, see the Fiesta and Focus transmission problems.
t1_dv5px1u	0	*	European Fords are European cars, designed in Germany mostly. The entire line up basically bar a few minor import models has little or nothing to do with Ford US.

t1_dv5mhtg	0	*	Derangement Syndrome.  Must take the opposite position of anything perceived to be pro Trump. 
t1_dv5lnnt	1	*	Even better they have been electing them for over 50 years.
t1_dv572xt	1	*	I hope they survive. I really liked their new designs. 
t1_dv5615e	0	*	Can't tax American manufacturing in trade war... if American manufacturing doesn't exist in the first place.  Checkmate atheists
t1_dv68g7e	1	*	There *are* cases where it'd be better to not trade with a certain country's industry to avoid exploitation, but I hear Italy uses torture and China has low wages are not good reasons.
t1_dv565vo	1	*	If you see the petrol prices in Europe, it's no wonder US cars don't sell well.
t1_dv52wa3	1	*	Yes I know that he supports protectionism for essentially only developing industries/countries. However, the history that u/squarecoinman produces is false, which was the point of my comment.
t1_dv5vu65	0	*	What Nissan?

t1_dv4te4z	1	*	>  There is no product available in the EU where an American one is better than an EU or Asian one.  Ehm.........they've got pretty good military stuff over there...
t1_dv56kw8	1	*	That seems a bit harsh since there is already a 100% Idiot Tax on all Trump products. How about 99.9%?
t1_dv5bu8f	0	*	46%, practically half.
t1_dv5bobk	1	*	It's hard to take anything he says seriously.  So many people don't know the difference between lose and loose it's incredible.
t1_dv5mmrr	1	*	I kind of look at you guys as our gone rogue mars colony
t1_dv4zdgj	1	*	Overwhelming stupidity.  
t1_dv4z324	1	*	This is Trump's 11 dimensional chess move. Piss off the GOP by taking away their guns and protectionism, and get impeached by his base that would have never dared to impeach him. 
t1_dv57ivk	1	*	yes but the Fords that have been selling well in Europe for decades are not what you would call an American car, they were mostly models designed specifically for Europe, made in Europe.
t1_dv60vy1	0	*	That's the thing though if you don't buy they can't screw you. We like getting screwed apparently.
t1_dv4xgsu	1	*	Gorbachev couldn't handle perestroika.
t1_dv5lytq	1	*	Lol, like how VW deliberately scammed emissions testing to beat our environmental regulations.

t1_dssvjhg	0	*	Well... those that neglect history are doomed to repeat it
t1_dtb07ps	0	*	The poem was used to raise money for the pedestal that made it possible to erect the statue in the first place, so I don't see how it would have nothing to do with it.

t1_duczqo8	1	*	Literally US foreing policy on Afghanistan haha
t1_duc8cdk	0	*	Yes, they are less hypocritical than US for sure, well NK is at the same level as US maybe  
t1_ducmzvr	1	*	Because the European powers got tired and destroyed by war, and a full world war this time and age would mean full nuclear war. Thats the US invades small countries but never another nuclear power.
t1_ducbvtx	0	*	Um... Yes? The ANA is full of people who have lost loved ones to the taliban. 
t1_duj6zva	1	*	Well, some people think that, sure, and that's a bummer.

t1_duk0fua	1	*	Chicken,  chicken chicken.
t1_dueb5om	1	*	Nope just an anecdotal one from someone in the forces. US bases in Europe are never going anywhere, especially the major ones in Germany.
t1_duao5nh	1	*	Unfortunately that is a common story across the developing world 
t1_du8vo4j	1	*	What's going on in Yemen is genocide.

t1_du8b8hx	0	*	>l this person has just gone full tilt on their RT propaganda.   Lol. You don't actually think that do you?
t1_du78vnl	0	*	It's not a rough jailhouse experience but he's not a free man by anyone's standards. I'd say that makes the embassy a jail of sorts.
t1_du7zee7	0	*	Why are you lying?  They had consensual sec with a condom then once she fell asleep he raped her without a condom because he wanted to spread his seed as he says. That's fucking rape 
t1_du82i13	1	*	Wikileaks has always been run by the Russians, don't be delusional.
t1_du6whgp	0	*	Or get 10 Assange look alikes to all run out with him in different directions
t1_du79x66	0	*	No, most legal experts agree that there is nothing to charge him with.
t1_du8v1lm	0	*	You must be a special kind of stupid to see what Wikileaks said to Don Trump Jr. And not believe they are a Russian backed operation.
t1_du6s0bz	0	*	>If all the claims were admitted false  They weren't, so what the hell are you talking about?
t1_du7qi6l	1	*	Assanges dirt on Trump was already publically availiable information was their rationale for not releasing it. Seems fair enough to me.
t1_du8aejy	0	*	You mean, the place he can't leave because the US trapped him there?  A comfortable prison is still a prison.
t1_du77sqf	0	*	He skipped bail because he reasonably believed that he would be handed to the US and rail-roaded. What good is due process if the end-point is predetermined, and irrational? 
t1_du6rzfp	1	*	Hard to help Putin from a jail cell I'd imagine too.
t1_du7bc6h	1	*	What red scare? Russia isn't communist anymore.
t1_du887t7	1	*	Political capital isn't unlimited, you get if you give and you won't get everything.
t1_du6rdfu	0	*	You don't get to skip bail for a reason.   The judge wasn't buying that this amounted to being unlawfully detained. I think. I haven't read the whole judgement. 
t1_du7htae	1	*	*clearly no ulterior motive here*
t1_duzgome	1	*	Well, he really said so, news are not fake. If there is at least a bit of sense in what he said is completely different question.

t1_dswgmui	0	*	What are you?

t1_dtyh8jy	1	*	It's generally not the same thing, having a seperate but equal category means places that only recognize marriages won't recognize the domestic partnership.
t1_dty2ndn	0	*	I'm Mexican and the churches around me don't let you have a wedding unless you're already regularly married (have the certificate), probably the same as in the US.

t1_dsdfyck	1	*	And now you have basically a military dictatorship in the form of Sisi.  Which is why i used the term dictators. 
t1_ds3ti1q	1	*	That started long before Trump. Look how Obama abandoned Mubarak, everyone took notice what US support means.
t1_du2qb6g	1	*	One of those has American interests although corrupt the other two are alt-reich and russian. 
t1_du2ke40	0	*	That's on you fam.
t1_du2lgbb	0	*	I'm merely pointing out that fake news isn't just news that is incorrect.  It is news that is purposely spreading a fake message.
t1_dsxxs8d	0	*	Comparing the US to the EU in these matters is like comparing a Ford Mustang to a Tesla.   Sure both are good and fast cars. But there are differences.  
t1_dstvpnu	1	*	No I don't. Do you?
t1_dstip1p	1	*	I don't either, but l'Institut national de la langue franxe7aise is going to push hard for it-- being the hardcore prescriptive linguists they are.  
t1_dtafoqe	0	*	I mentioned her as an American celebrity in the first place. Yes, she is a Ukrainian-Canadian to be precise.
t1_dt4jfpm	1	*	Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang (Gucci gang)  Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang (Gucci gang)
t1_dt5m2kz	1	*	How do we have too much unchecked power? That's news to me.
t1_dt7k3rs	1	*	Nah we ship her straight to the Dutch Gulag where she repairs bikes and carves clogs.
t1_dt4gffk	1	*	It works pretty well in the Netherlands.
t1_dv0kgyd	1	*	> only glaring errors.  Found one 
t1_dv06rnz	0	*	Tasers and rubiks cubes
t1_duuo286	1	*	Too slow. That already happened.
t1_duutxgs	1	*	lol, call it whatever you want guys. Be happy - China
t1_duufhb7	0	*	I wouldn't have though photocopiers warranted civilian tech's, why this particular thing is there a civilian? 
t1_duu1q3u	0	*	Wackjob, take a look at the individual's name too :P.
t1_dtp1np6	0	*	Yep.  It is pretty common for companies to branch out into other industries. Heck, Sony is the largest insurance company in Japan.
t1_du5yk4m	1	*	Lol, The European majority celebrating wiping out natives. That must be really hard. I mean its not like Nazis or anything. Its only bad if nazis does it. They lost the war. 
t1_dss20jr	1	*	Than you aren't looking very hard.
t1_ds6trwu	1	*	You aren't a real Redditor. No real Redditor would say something like that. I'm going to upvote you so that everyone can see what to look out for when they look for a fake Redditor.
t1_ds6hv39	0	*	Not a real person...?? You saying a bot, paid troll or someone not worthy of being considered a person.
t1_ds6lfzp	0	*	How could you possible think Clinton wouldnt be better? 
t1_dt3hzmj	1	*	This guy embezzles. 
t1_dt72mbe	1	*	Just because it contradicts your preconceptions, does not mean it is wrong.
t1_dt2q6rl	0	*	Just because it contradicts your preconceptions, does not therefore mean it is wrong.
t1_dt2cy5f	0	*	Sure he could but he would need to either sell his Amazon stocks or use them as collateral to borrow against.
t1_dsw2csd	0	*	I'm perfectly happy to criticise capitalism, but I must admit it's far less likely to lead to the collapse of a country. 
t1_dsgwfeh	0	*	> would have been more like a mountain range  Isn't that the Himalayas?  
t1_dsgkhab	0	*	The ones living below 10m will come at you.
t1_dshk7gb	1	*	Higher pressures favours low entropy states so increasing pressure reduces melt. That said magmatism at ocean ridges is on a much larger scale than this movement.
t1_dsimuy2	1	*	Find me multiple articles saying that the sea floor is sinking.
t1_dsgzzsd	0	*	I always imagine a kind of giant deer-spider (upper body of a deer, lower body of a spider).
t1_dshs968	1	*	What, those little guys? I wouldn't worry about those little guys.
t1_dshiz3e	0	*	but as the styrofoam sinks it displaces more water.  Where does the displaced material go?
t1_dtrjkzs	0	*	> You don't see that getting the tough guy Israeli's elected isn't Hamas's plan?  I don't think that's seriously possible. Otherwise they are extremely bad at what they're trying to do.
t1_duvwjyy	1	*	That is literally basically impossible. Oh. Unless their country mines for rare earth elements used in solar panels and batteries. 
t1_ds5pbvc	1	*	Yup, thnx for explaining. 
t1_du15aaz	1	*	Just tell government it will increase the tax base, theyll be all over it.
t1_du29a2y	1	*	Lol
t1_du209uk	1	*	Taking responsibilities brings meaning to life? Profound.
t1_du2lux7	1	*	> taking responsibilities.  I would be glad to if my responsibilities didn't include making my rich boss even more rich at any cost.
t1_du1g8nw	1	*	I went through that too. I really think that it makes them feel even more shitty, because why are you happy when I am not? kind of thing. They want to drag you down to make themselves feel better.
t1_du4jioi	1	*	Similar but not the same. No mention of a 'Global Happiness Council' in the report, but it covers all the same topics. Thanks for the link, though.
t1_du20esc	1	*	Cowmutualism.
t1_du1v26u	0	*	It isn't necessary to know or even like someone to treat them like a person and make decisions accordingly.
t1_du1fmd9	1	*	Why is it the corporations job to treat mental illness? 
t1_du262tv	1	*	Obvious sarcasm  You must be new to the internet.
t1_du1fadr	1	*	True, I shouldnt conflate the two. Appreciate your calling me out.
t1_du22an9	1	*	That's fair, I just didn't agree with the view that there is no treatment. 
t1_dtnq2hb	1	*	I'm surprised. I figure a headline about male rape would've lit up the MRA Signal and gotten fedora'd gentlesirs from all over the place to heroically stand up against male oppression. 
t1_dto3n64	1	*	You truly are possesed by these ideas.
t1_dtmvlzp	0	*	Just link the joke 
t1_dto5qc6	0	*	Kinda obvious.
t1_dtmxa01	0	*	Honestly, no, it's worse than that.  >It seems like some men need to feel like victims  That's endorsing men getting abused, it's saying men deserve it. 
t1_dtn0r90	0	*	I mean, one can take the nothing ever is true option, but it's better than nothing.
t1_dtndxec	1	*	> yet no one complains  Buuuuuuuullshiiiiiiiiit
t1_dt0pyyv	1	*	He can push for whatever he wants, McConnell isn't stupid and won't get rid of the Filibuster threshold under any circumstances. He knows what's very possibly coming this November and beyond. 
t1_dun14pl	0	*	They didn't just pick the darkest, they picked the one with the highest confidence level.
t1_dumvuv7	0	*	This explains Captain Picard. Checkmate, Star Trek canon.
t1_dunlvn1	1	*	There's a documentary called star trek where a Frenchman is british.
t1_dun6491	0	*	I expect the EDF would love this, spin it as proof of superiority and proof immigrants are bad all in one little package.
t1_dun7dqv	1	*	Uh, no that's not what OP was referring to. THE UKIP people obviously worried/talked more about how the flood of refugees is replacing the people there, and the accompanying culture. 
t1_dumfsqa	0	*	I think he hoping to get some action out of it ?
t1_dun171z	1	*	Dark skin and blue eyes are only statistically linked in modern populations, they're not genetically connected. There's no reason you couldn't have such a population existing.
t1_dun6e51	1	*	But there is no archaeological evidence to suggest it wasnt peaceful, probably due to the original population being decimated by disease
t1_dunz1eh	1	*	I think he's referring to DnD's version http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Firbolg
t1_dunjw2m	1	*	I assume what it means is that, of the human remains that they've found that they've dated to those periods, those are the proportions that show evidence of a violent death.
t1_dumkk9s	1	*	Like Turkmenistan?
t1_due0pm6	0	*	Well you say that, but one side keeps doing remarkably evil things.
t1_dudn1q7	0	*	I suppose, not Belgium and youve won.
t1_dudg7xa	1	*	Slavs love them some tracksuits. Adidas is the Armani of eastern Europe 
t1_dunn837	1	*	Ye I got that idea by all the discussions on this sub lately.
t1_dv5mkdc	0	*	I wonder why they don't have as many Jews???
t1_du3x2es	0	*	There was the whole 'blasphemy law' drama last year but absolutely nothing  came from it.
t1_dua9l8s	1	*	Im sure their lawyers would have prevented somethings from happening. It is not illegal to hold a monopoly, you just can't unfairly use that advantage to stifle competition in a different market.
t1_duaevzf	1	*	I would think he was comparing Walmart jobs in Canada vs. other jobs in Canada.
t1_dtfork3	1	*	I never thought I'd see one much less create one.
t1_dtfiopn	1	*	Hey I'm just brainstorming. Not a rocket scientist myself. I work with iron.
t1_dtgigof	1	*	It's only scary if they can maintain the power for a significant amount of time.  Spoiler: they can't.
t1_dtg6fqg	0	*	Damn, that's pretty useless.
t1_dt753f7	1	*	CO2 emissions from shipping are well under 6 percent of total CO2 emissions, other transportation is about 13 percent of total emissions.
t1_dt77anj	0	*	Youre talking about a barge with dozens of TEU, many of which cant be accessed without a crane. How many pirates have access to a crane capable of moving shipping containers?
t1_dt6ogae	1	*	There are two definitions. One is a ship rigged with sails, the other is a colloquial (and anachronistic) term for the activity a ship is embarking upon when it leaves port.
t1_dt77bdv	0	*	That's $500 million dollars if you count for inflation
t1_dsdgtz1	0	*	Blood thinners, I think.
t1_dt2o7q1	1	*	> how many people use it  That metric hit a cap a while back.
t1_dsv12x1	1	*	Have a russian friend, so from his experience.
t1_durk2hj	1	*	Was a dreamer. Not any longer.
t1_dt4x8wk	0	*	Vast majority of reviewers loved it, interesting you're fixating on one of the few negative reviews, wonder if you have some other agenda?
t1_dt5cw4r	0	*	Just for one year, it wasn't released in Italy until 1991
t1_dt5ruew	1	*	Dude's profile has snow on its boots.
t1_dt4v13a	1	*	I have seen it, and couldn't disagree more.
t1_dt5p6dx	1	*	Ah, you're right there 
t1_dt644ut	1	*	Seeing as how historically, communism has always been at odds with both oligarchies AND nationalists, yeah it's a little out there.
t1_dt57ka9	1	*	*Ahaaaaaaaaaa!*
t1_dt5z8eo	1	*	*Back of the net* 
t1_dt5pdv1	1	*	Can I dislike both of them?
t1_dsyji0a	0	*	that's not the way congress is set up. All senators are responsible for their own actions.
t1_du068y5	0	*	Lol overblown as fuck. People don't get bullied for clothes at uniform schools. Whoever told you that is exaggerating or went to a shit hole school.
t1_du0g1lj	0	*	both genders?!? to jail with you

t1_dsihwjz	1	*	KenM?
t1_dtd0uk0	0	*	China still worships Mao who killed tens of millions and his face is on the reminibi.  
t1_dusyiwv	1	*	No offense, but all dictators are ultimately evil. 
t1_dut12lj	0	*	Unoriginal af, I know
t1_duszhy1	1	*	I meant, even in a totalitarian system. (Like China.)
t1_dusztno	0	*	Yea we're getting Opium Wared ourselves (Chinese fentanyl).
t1_dut1a96	1	*	I got the jest of the plot at that moment, but it took me up to now to realise it's drawing reference to that line
t1_dut235y	1	*	Ohhhh lol my bad
t1_dut2x27	1	*	Is he really as bad as Putin? I always thought he was more competent and less of a scumbag. Though my thoughts of Putin are probably somewhat biased coming from US propaganda. 
t1_duti6ki	1	*	There was no codified term limit when FDR was president. He ran, and won, four times because there was nothing stopping him to begin with. Which led to the 22nd amendment.
t1_dut556w	1	*	At least Japan wont be invading anyone anytime soon!
t1_dut6flm	1	*	They aren't competing for Mongolian mines?
t1_duucsz6	1	*	You're replying to a guy living under a literal dictator 
t1_dut69f2	0	*	? I was too? As in, I'm not mad and thought the bbc interview was hilarious?
t1_dut5s2c	1	*	Well its very nice to have you around. 
t1_duss3a9	0	*	I guess I still have a lot to learn.
t1_duu0k8c	1	*	will look into it, thanks.
t1_dut20xa	0	*	I'm not Mongolian but i played volleyball with some when i lived in Baotou.  You live in Ulaanbataar or the sticks? How fast is your internet?
t1_dutlg8w	0	*	> Den Jow Ping  having a hard time thinking you're knowledgeable about anything considering you can't spell his name right and it's not even phonetically correct.  
t1_dusx47u	1	*	> The country was in shambles after the strangulation the Kremlin put it through.  I reject that characterization of events.
t1_dutfpba	0	*	Or democracy is just shit in developing countries...
t1_duss0do	1	*	If you understand how the Congress works in China youll not think this way. The Congress holds no power at all.
t1_dut1dl5	1	*	He's right, it's not an ideology we can afford to lose.
t1_duszakg	1	*	Not Chinese, but I'm impressed by your very reasonable and thoughtful comment.  I hope there are more people that will think like you.
t1_dutaaah	0	*	Smug Canadians on this site are the fucking worst.
t1_dutajf5	1	*	Iraq as well
t1_dusrsfy	1	*	A [The_Donald](https://snoopsnoo.com/u/blackdaycare#by-subreddit) user pretending to be Chinese.
t1_dut585e	1	*	Uh, they have the internet. English is the official language of the internet, and they are pretty likely to know it.  Your statement applies to the older generation, but not this current one.
t1_dutd33w	1	*	Because yanks always act like theyre saints. 
t1_dut3rtu	1	*	> If the US sticks to its promise  
t1_dustmy1	1	*	Well better dictator xi than dictator trump
t1_dut3p0q	0	*	The situation in Saudi Arabia is different. They're already a highly centralized, authoritarian state, moreso than China. The goal there is largely to take power from the clerics. 
t1_dusrxt1	1	*	Can you find literally one example of that? Usually there are 2-3 highly upvoted comments in support and like 50 comments that are negative.
t1_dusx5wt	0	*	> I think the cold truth is that ~~western style liberal democracy~~ governments are fundamentally flawed systems, tried in history but ultimately failed.  
t1_dutrwbs	1	*	alash orda!
t1_dusy85h	0	*	I went through his history and he just seems like a dingus, not a paid shill. But keep up the critical thinking, your head is in the right place. 
t1_dut1q7m	1	*	There's no fairness after eight years. I'm sure Merkel low-blowed someone to not be replaced. Just because there's elections don't means it's a fair democracy.
t1_duta81e	1	*	I don't know, comparing him to Putin isn't great. Putin has stolen hundred of billions from his own citizens, and murdered many. 
t1_dut0arj	0	*	Yeah and they also eat too much rice. /s. But could you elaborate?
t1_dut0jfn	0	*	I believe china doesnt need democracy to thrive, but they needed the two term limit. Its worked well why change it now?  All that has to happen is xi handing over to another comunnist party leader
t1_dussbst	1	*	Yea, at least he tries! I can imagine Churchill saying some weird shit about this like, There is no democracy, just higher and less higher levels of authoritarianism..  
t1_dut1ruv	1	*	Eloquent summary friend.
t1_dut6hw1	1	*	Hopefully without the famine and the decimation of bird species.
t1_duti89q	1	*	A normal member of the us house of Representatives is not particularly powerful. The people in party leadership are but the run of the mill congressman is not. 
t1_duswwiq	1	*	Fair enough but was there ever a case when the leader's decision to remove term limits made the country less autocratic and more stable?
t1_dut1370	0	*	Dont forget Russia. I doubt Putin will lose this next election
t1_dusxwrk	0	*	Says who? People living in western liberal democracies beg to differ.
t1_dut0aoj	1	*	huge difference between Im staying and Ive been elected.
t1_dut1eni	0	*	I bet that guys a riot... a raping pillaging riot...
t1_dusurbr	0	*	Wait - what's so great about Putin? Just that he's not doped up and suicidal? I hope you're not trying to say Putin is good for Russia and China would do well to emulate him?
t1_dut6711	1	*	I think different is a pretty safe prediction though.
t1_dusym7s	1	*	Also not Mongolian U0001f60a huer l jileer Mongold amdrsan. But seriously amjild husie you're probably screwed U0001f602
t1_dusyk9h	1	*	Hopefully China doesn't pay for it later on, if they allow a dictatorship. That seems to be what usually happens in history
t1_dusy48u	1	*	**Ten** thousand years.   
t1_dut444y	1	*	For example whats your opinion of Attila the Hun ?
t1_dusyinh	0	*	Is there a particular reason for the seemingly violent culture? Does it stem from some sort of economic or political situation, or is being a fighter just seen as a positive there?
t1_dusx1ag	1	*	Putin is an example of a *good* dictator?   I think there are many who would disagree.
t1_dut14qb	1	*	Cue the Mongoltage! 
t1_duswvt3	1	*	Putin is evil though...Murdered 1000s of innocent people
t1_dut4ajb	0	*	Somehow? It's been like this since we climbed down from trees. 
t1_duulfd0	0	*	China Uncensored on YouTube is pretty amusing with its telling of CCP politics:  https://www.youtube.com/user/NTDChinaUncensored/videos
t1_duvn2jh	0	*	well i don't know of any ballot or voter manipulation (except the common stuff in every us election) ... so what ya mean? 
t1_duu412h	1	*	Or conveniently dies.
t1_dut6v4b	0	*	Thats a fascinating transliteration of Done Schaw Bangs name.
t1_dut4sia	0	*	Thank you for responding.
t1_duu56i4	1	*	It's only the beginning of 2018. Fuck.
t1_dut1ej8	1	*	Norway? Best maybe, but best does not mean easy.   Norway is one of the hardest countries to immigrate to.
t1_dutdfuz	0	*	china has always been a dictatorship of the CCP. The CCP having one leader or changing doesn't really make any difference. The average person has no more or less say than they did before. 
t1_duszy0j	1	*	You how we can tell your country is terrible?  You didnt say evil dictator like mao  Youre not allowed to criticize  
t1_dut6dj0	0	*	Putin is acting a lot like the Roman consuls during the fall of the roman republic.  They did the same tricks to convince the people to slowly relinquish power over time to the emperors.
t1_dutdhix	0	*	People take democracy for granted. The nature and history of mankind is far from conducive to democracy.
t1_dusunfy	1	*	I remember a saying. Young people are only x% of a society, but they are 100% of its future.
t1_dut2myi	1	*	China sees Taiwan as part of China, and theres a lot of support among Chinese people to recapture Taiwan.
t1_dut6ba4	1	*	Let's all aspire to the heights of Iraq. How do we model that lofty nation? 
t1_dusyf6y	0	*	The Party will still choose the leader, this doesn't change that. It just explicitly allows one to retain the title President for more than two terms. 
t1_dusrhcw	0	*	Not. Yet.
t1_dut21fe	0	*	His problem is to retire in peace without potential persecution or revenge. I dont think he has a plan for that.
t1_dut0zmj	1	*	Farmer Li has no idea whats going on. Farmer Li represents half the country. 
t1_dutniiw	1	*	You are so naive if you think a dictator has a good chance of doing a good job. Please learn history. This will very probably not end well for anyone. Good luck to all.
t1_dut5hf6	0	*	Forgive me if I'm misreading what you're saying, but are you vocally supporting the suppression of the Tiananmen Square protest?
t1_dutvblv	0	*	may you live in interesting times  
t1_dusxnip	0	*	I thought of this the second he was elected. The writing is on the wall for it with the military parades/praise and how he invokes God whenever his approval dips. It's only a matter of time.
t1_duszmt3	1	*	Except y'all dominate sumo.   I assume with traditional Mongolian wrestling it's just in the blood.   Hakuho is literally a living legend. Unreal. 
t1_duti80k	0	*	He is choosing a book for reading
t1_dut6fcm	1	*	Yeah... It's not that, either. If it was the Trump family would be nowhere near power. 
t1_duv74xv	0	*	Im hoping voters arent so stupid as to fall for the same gag twice.
t1_dusx65f	1	*	Laws are not made for good people, they are made for all people.  Even if Xi is the second coming of Jesus, his successor probably won't be.
t1_dusxuhz	1	*	Exactly. Plus now president in Russia rules for 6 years per term.
t1_dutirmq	1	*	I always thought saying Genghis Khan is Chinese is like saying queen Victoria was Indian.  
t1_dusx1p9	1	*	Right, thanks for telling me that. Still even if I had known that I think I would've written the same thing since as you say it's the party's constitution that matters.
t1_dut5qba	1	*	redacted
t1_duszzo0	1	*	Hitler was welcomed into most European countries with thunderous applause and open arms. It was once he had full control that he started doing all the crazy shit. Be warned.
t1_dsxsbia	1	*	In this case public means publicly accessable. I had to sit through a three hour seminar that was essentially how to not get sued by anyone who even claims to have a disability
t1_duu9t4z	1	*	How are they going to stop trade with China? I mean theres no ocean between them?
t1_dut1ddr	1	*	Unfortunately. I was just exploring a (hopeful) possibility. It's impossible to predict him accurately.
t1_dv22l54	0	*	I really dont know where you're getting the idea that married men or women dont abuse kids
t1_dv240u7	0	*	Look at the British parliament like. Allowed to marry. Still pedophiles among their ranks.
t1_dv21vui	0	*	This is the real reason why allowing priest to marry would drop the number of pederast priests.  Not some rubbish about how it makes people crazy to not marry.  
t1_dv2ccxj	1	*	It is that simple when you know that time spent isn't being refunded either way.
t1_dv2xaxr	1	*	In Canada's Residential schools, nuns were just as abusive as priests. 
t1_dv25t4y	0	*	> So technically they weren't telling a lie, only a different version of the truth.  So alternate facts?   Glad to see the liberal bias and double standards are alive and well on Reddit.
t1_dv1bwkv	0	*	Theyre tired from a single instance of a falling rocket malfunction that didnt actually hit houses? Why dont you look for a few more seconds so your original statements make sense.
t1_dskb4ku	1	*	That one time when he had to tie his shoe.
t1_dsk9dlq	0	*	Can I sue him for libel yet? Really let's open these libel laws up!
t1_dskk1yw	1	*	An *American U0001f1faU0001f1f8* McDonald's, the best kind! 
t1_dskd3eq	1	*	Except those years he was running the Jets. 
t1_dskbp9l	0	*	Well... apart from that Farage bloke, anyway. He seems to be a ~~complete and utter sycophantic bellend~~ fan.
t1_dsk584m	1	*	When you're President, they let you do it. Trump, probably
t1_dsk8jl1	0	*	All I want is for Obama to join Harry on his stag night now.

t1_dsk7c8w	1	*	>My daughter has much nicer tits and ass than her.  I can imagine fucking my own daughter but never her.  SAD
t1_dskdf9m	1	*	Yeah you elected the 4Chan comments as your president.   But most of you didn't, so it would be dumb to hold it against you. Most of us are just kicking back and enjoying the show.

t1_dskfzvb	1	*	Yea but those laws are for him to use not to be used on him! He's so transparently a dictator it's absurd. His supporters, no matter how moronic, are culpable.
t1_dskbc6j	1	*	Your own people arent welcome in your country?
t1_dskb5ue	1	*	Privileged life privileged positions 
t1_dskbrf3	0	*	hope he doesn't rape kids like the du pont heir - you know the one that got away with it? cause he wouldn't fair well in jail - blah 
t1_dskdhug	0	*	Eh depends where you are. Not really had much rain here. Just snow and fog
t1_dsk84cu	1	*	Did you not see the mass protests we had going on over here? The womens march in LA stands out. He doesnt give a fuck
t1_dske008	0	*	My pleasure, does he not have to do press conferences, is he not badgered relentlessly until he has to recant?
t1_dskbk1u	1	*	This is why I believed the Gorilla channel joke for a few minutes.  No, this can't be, right? Oh wait this is Trump we're talking about, in that case it could very well be true.
t1_dskmnu6	1	*	I have often heard of the robert wood Johnson foundation.  Never figured out where the money came from.  (yes i am an NPR listener)
t1_dsk4nh1	1	*	I'm actually one of the view republicans (anti-monarchists) in the UK but whatever makes you happy man. 
t1_dsk6qq7	0	*	Hahaha the president of the US lied about easily verifiable facts only to protect his fragile ego. That's not something that happens every day. Wait. Oh.
t1_dskbi3c	1	*	He walked right into that 
t1_dskhumj	1	*	Quite possibly hallucinate that she has blood dripping from her face.  Sadly he's done this before.  With Mika Brzezinski
t1_dskgxbo	0	*	That's all well and good but, why would Trump be invited anyway after his disrespectful comments about Lady Di?
t1_dskazrs	1	*	Meghan Markle is half black, so we already know he hates her. 
t1_dskartg	0	*	Don't forget Britain first are a huge fan of his
t1_dskfbry	0	*	ahaha brilliante - anonymous sources arent jounalism your killin it boi!!
t1_dskau4r	1	*	He has also not been granted a visit to the Queen, and the Prince stated that he doesn't want to meet Trump other than to give him an ear bashing over his mistreatment of vulnerable people.
t1_dskflua	1	*	By just airing what he says.. 
t1_dskoycv	1	*	Ignorance is bliss for the intolerant it seems.
t1_dskhmdg	0	*	Royal or not she is the deceased mother of the groom.
t1_dsk5tng	1	*	No, most of us didn't know who he was until he ran.  Then many Americans looked at the person opposing him and said well fuck I guess we'll go with an orange.
t1_dskgy91	1	*	Yeah, his binary mind seems to work purely in relation to how much money is in a certain area. He knows Mayfair has a reputation for being expensive and therefore he wants the embassy to be there. 
t1_dskbn3k	0	*	Yeah, he wanted to sleep with a beautiful woman. What a terrible human being.
t1_dslblt7	1	*	Yep. A fucking moron
t1_dskhp6h	1	*	Oh. I see.  Carry on, then.
t1_dskcfpc	1	*	This month? 
t1_dsk8vtx	1	*	At best, this shitshow is going to plateau. We all know it's not going to plateau. Not while he's in power
t1_dslahyt	1	*	what is with the repeated nervous comments. Is that an insult in Russia?
t1_dskd519	1	*	fuck the jets?
t1_dskfijm	1	*	Low risk, high reward. Less rewarding if done today tho.... 
t1_dskcplu	0	*	> Well actually Trump just carried on the same plan Obama had been doing.  And you lot think Trump is mentally unstable. Jesus.
t1_dsk5odg	1	*	B-but it's fake news media who made this image of his! That's what his supporters keep telling us!
t1_dskg1fq	0	*	His supporters are only a diagnosis away from a committal. What they think is utterly irrelivent at this point.
t1_dskv5ah	1	*	It's a [Classic commercial] (https://youtu.be/hMlP_Moo0bE). 
t1_dskhau4	1	*	Yes, Trump should definitely have an AIDS test.
t1_dsk9azq	0	*	I read elsewhere it was Obama.  Got a source on Bush?  https://uk.usembassy.gov/u-s-takes-first-steps-toward-embassy-relocation/
t1_dskfl2w	1	*	It would be a huge protest.  The biggest.  No one attracts protest like Trump.  Sad.
t1_dskkb41	1	*	I'm a Jets fan and this is an accurate statement.
t1_dskgv7v	1	*	Agreed.
t1_dskdfgp	1	*	note: against the FSB and therefore Trump  Every now and then a paranoid idiot might stumble on a half truth
t1_dsk7nsg	1	*	Just because you have a book from the future doesn't mean you can't also be an idiot.  Trump might have the former but is clearly the latter.
t1_dsk8buy	0	*	Please keep it going. Shame bounces right off of him here, perhaps global snubs will affect him. 
t1_dskkhyi	1	*	This is Mitch McConnell's throwaway account lol
t1_dsk9mi4	1	*	Still having a state visit at some point but just not opening embassy next month.
t1_dskarn3	1	*	Yup. First reply to that tweet from mustanggirl or whatever says it all.
t1_dskjvjj	1	*	Everyone has rough times. No matter how much money you have you'll experience stress, problems and heartbreak.
t1_dsk8hgz	0	*	I'm seeing more and more, I support Trump, but I wish he'd have the good sense to shut up. lately. There's at least a glimmer of hope that the walls are cracking.
t1_dslai8h	1	*	what is with the repeated nervous comments. Is that an insult in Russia?
t1_dskoqo9	0	*	Nobody tell Trump about the tv show ARCHER.  They're a group of skilled agents, called ISIS, who sometimes do good things. Once they protected the Pope from assassins.
t1_dsk27x7	1	*	k, no. This is an example how T_D would mock someone.
t1_dsk5n6c	1	*	No, because the secret service will want to set up their own security on top of British security. 
t1_dskaclc	1	*	Also even if it was an Obama plan, why would that stop Trump from going to the UK now?
t1_dskimsh	0	*	About as likely as the first go around.
t1_dsk9xpj	1	*	 >He'll probably tweet something disgusting about how Meghan Markle looks.   Actually, hell be there to claim *primae noctis*
t1_dskip7y	0	*	Let's be real; he just tweets. 
t1_dskd378	1	*	How dare they serve the public and in general be rather nice! 
t1_dsk5qtw	1	*	I hope we only ever have one US president  using Twitter to start schoolyard fights 
t1_dsk7v00	1	*	Third, behind working for the Trump administration.
t1_dsk7v0u	1	*	Mueller's done with the investigation for sure this time!
t1_dskadoe	1	*	But my circlejerk
t1_dsknmbk	0	*	Okay could you provide a source that confirms this? Because right now it's source vs feelings. 
t1_dskdlm9	1	*	Damn. 
t1_dsk9hh7	1	*	If there were a petition to keep Trump out of America, I have no doubt we could get millions of signatures. 
t1_dsk90hf	1	*	We arent letting him within200 miles of our queen. 
t1_dskders	1	*	I hear ya. 
t1_dskktq2	1	*	Oh really? I didn't know that, thanks
t1_dskgm8k	1	*	This would actually maybe be good. He would piss off the royalists on the far right as well as everyone who thinks racism is bad. A truly United Kingdom for a few hours.
t1_dskfx7o	0	*	You're not old enough to remember her then, she was remarkable.
t1_dskjor2	1	*	Whilst I don't like the guy myself, I wouldn't say he's universally hated over here. There's just a reasonably large, and very loud group of people that hate him.
t1_dskbt5h	1	*	Some sort of passive aggressive racist sexist negging. It will be amazing, in a horrible way.
t1_dsk5fdq	1	*	She's pretty much the only Western leader even pretending to like him too
t1_dskjplo	0	*	I'm taking the Australian view. Fanny means Cunt.
t1_dsknim6	1	*	MI6? Why not just call it MIIIIII? I like that, sounds like 'me'. - Trump 2018
t1_dskgs7n	1	*	The really stupid part is that it's so easy to just.... Check. Just look it up. Bam, right there in front of you.  If you type Britain US new embassy into google, it's literally the first result.
t1_dsjvri7	1	*	During his campaign he signed 12 business deals in Saudi Arabia. 
t1_dsk9ulg	1	*	> Dude would be the first person sent to prison for it.  You put it that way perhaps I could come around on that idea. 
t1_dsryypy	0	*	Look up the definitions to words before you use them.
t1_ds52nrn	0	*	Technically it's both. Global warming causes climate change, necessarily. 
t1_ds3p47v	0	*	The UNFCCC was adopted in 1992. Guess what the last 2 C's stand for.
t1_ds4uous	1	*	Holy shit did you not get the joke...
t1_ds3s9aw	1	*	It doesn't matter to you right?  If something happens in 100 years or in 4 billion years, right, either way you will be dead before it happens, so fuck everyone in the next generation right?
t1_ds4m51e	1	*	I don't know in the US, but in my country the most conservatives are non-catholic churches
t1_ds3nerl	1	*	why don't you just kill yourself now with that thinking. Either way you're going to die, why not now?
t1_ds44uin	1	*	The glaciers aren't retreating, they're in a tactical retrograde movement.
t1_ds4g3ap	1	*	Frying pan.
t1_ds51qom	1	*	Trump will believe anything if it involves money.
t1_ds4cxqz	1	*	Arizonan here. Highs in the 70s all week. I have yet to even break out the winter coat this season. 
t1_ds3ihk3	0	*	Neither is more accurate than the other; they're different things.  Climate change is caused by, among other things, global warming.
t1_ds3t1fm	0	*	Coincidently three hundred years ago the industrial revolution started and carbon emissions rose.  Maybe you should start with Dr. Suess because history and science are clearly not on your level.
t1_ds3jsht	0	*	California. I had to stop working FOR FEAR OF HEAT STROKE last week. December fucking 29. 
t1_ds3x7fu	0	*	A year? ...hottest **year** on record...
t1_ds3lwjo	0	*	Trump tweeted that exact same thing a week ago.
t1_ds4e8vs	0	*	Has anyone through about the impact on the world turtle?
t1_ds3p6eb	1	*	The suggestions are out there. Go read some studies. Whats causing it to get worse? Hmm lets reduce that. Pretty simple but people do t want to change quickly enough. 
t1_ds3sjuq	1	*	Conveniently though, the post in question deals with the world at large.

t1_ds3f5eb	1	*	Don't misunderestimate the need for /s on everything. /s
t1_ds45htu	1	*	This is the whole US right now border to border unusually cold, not just in the north east. Doesnt really relate to climate change specifically though.
t1_dt5cmo4	0	*	Never received any PMs sadly. Not one.
t1_dt5rck2	1	*	Or Jennifer Jason Lee?

t1_dtbwqh2	1	*	done
t1_dtbx1tg	1	*	Afaik most of the taliban attacks seem to happen in the city areas, while most of the taliban supporters are from the rural areas.  That has probably an effect on it.
t1_dtbwyu4	0	*	Trump speaks the truth? When? The guy is dumber than rocks.
t1_dtby2zy	0	*	Why are the taliban fighting against women, children, and fruitsellers?
t1_dtbxzjh	1	*	Whataboutism works both ways. I bet like all Americans you shot up your school and are addicted to opiates, or your one of the ones that are fat and spend all your time watching NASCAR.
t1_dtbv1et	1	*	Horrible to say it, but it's pretty much dog bites man. 
t1_dtbwib5	1	*	We are all Afghan on this blessed day!

t1_dtbzuhi	0	*	in a way, both share lots of similarities.  The principal difference seems to be scale
t1_dtbw8yd	1	*	Yeah instead of useless social media responses, Afghanistan is and will continue to receive actual support     How racists is that!
t1_dtbtz6x	0	*	No, and its really hard to tell where the middle east would be now if they hadnt. But a lot of the choices made by the states has certainly made it worse.
t1_dtcc2dn	0	*	They're not Muslim enough.
t1_dtcs7vz	0	*	So that some how it makes the crimes ok?
t1_dtck00c	1	*	Just ban racism obviously 
t1_dtc4w57	1	*	Not really. There have been 10+ school shootings in America this month alone and i hadnt heard a single thing about them before i googled the statistics.
t1_dtbwctn	0	*	To be fair, kids in other countries may have never seen a landmine before.
t1_dtbmcel	0	*	What childish political point?
t1_dtbuzlm	1	*	that's the right video, but you have to move to 1m25s, which the mobile app probably ignored
t1_dtc6411	1	*	One of the few things Trump got right
t1_dtbscez	1	*	Ideologies that work much the same as religions, with established rules of behavior and a godlike figure head.
t1_dtc0v3m	1	*	Very poor souls. It sucks but trust me when I say if non Afghan gets killed similarly Afghans could give a fuck less to. Actually they give even less of a fuck. 
t1_dtcdko3	0	*	r/india poster, makes you think. Idiot even your user smacks of indian
t1_dtbtfa7	0	*	That's *some* denomination's idea of hell

t1_dtc8fab	0	*	Not all Muslims are terrorist, but most terrorists are Muslim. 
t1_dtbuuth	1	*	Not that big if you have shrapnel
t1_dtbwvoi	1	*	He is an asshole for many other reasons. 
t1_dtbwb8c	0	*	There was literally an askreddit post where a guy wanted to know if he should wash his asshole and if it was normal to do so.

t1_dtccmyy	1	*	'This is America...nobody deserves to be treated as a black man!'
t1_dtbvx05	1	*	Yeah in order to cripple the government they have to destroy the police force. Then they can't rule and military victories become easier.
t1_dtc1s3r	1	*	I just feel bad for those people.. I couldn't imagine being brainwashed to the extent that they are. 
t1_dtbz5rj	1	*	That must be brutal to have to do. Also easy to see how an action like that alone can radicalise more people to fight for the Taliban also 
t1_dtbwgze	0	*	Uhm, don't make it about themselves
t1_dtby4u8	1	*	Occasionally he is blunt and true.   For the most part hes a pathological liar. 
t1_dtc4uln	1	*	A lot of them actually go unnoticed

t1_dtc1go3	1	*	>  Capitalism is no more ethical than Stalin's regime.  Build a time machine, go back to Berlin in the 1980's, visit West Germany and East Germany, come back and say that exact same statement.
t1_dtc09ts	1	*	Bless your heart
t1_dtcilze	0	*	How does she get around without either her father or your father escorting her?  How much can a home in Afghanistan go for to make any of that worthwhile? 
t1_dtc5abh	1	*	You can trace it back even further than that. If the Roman Empire had still been powerful in the region all this shit would never have happened in the first place. 
t1_dtbwjoa	1	*	Who's they? 
t1_dtbyvpw	1	*	Agreed. At least some of you are willing to take this the right way..
t1_dtbv0p8	1	*	Not to mention we have a group of people that literally hate any form of political news. And arguably, this is world politics
t1_dtchqsf	1	*	Nevermind 
t1_dtbrw1a	0	*	Most reasonable people don't wholly blame the US, but the disruption caused by multiple invasions certainly added to the instability and violence in the region.

t1_dtq4ecd	1	*	They consume less than 7 percent of oil production.
t1_dtq30qq	1	*	Five years might be generous, but I do agree a paradigm shift is inevitable.
t1_dtqik3u	0	*	Just an education problem.  A plunge is a sudden change in state.  In order for it to plunge by 2040 you will need to have it stay mostly the same for the next two decades.

t1_duqprah	1	*	Do we have a follow-up tweet yet with the cheeto declaring either 1) Fake News, 2) Witchhunt, or 3) Gates was untrustworthy and he never liked the guy?  Bonus points if it ends with very sad.
t1_duqmj6q	1	*	If he cooperates he will get -2 to -3 points for cooperation.  Under federal law, good behavior is up to 13% off.
t1_duqrs0j	1	*	Can you point me to all the posts you made about foriegn influence on the Clinton campaign? No. You cant. Because you are just a hypocrite.
t1_duqrp4o	1	*	This is just ONE charge though. Hes not going to serve 78-97 months. He has many more charges that carry much more time. 
t1_duqvxvb	1	*	Before Trump was elected I really didn't know who on my Facebook friends was a closet lunatic. Thanks to Trump, I now know.
t1_durazob	0	*	Why is it so hard to understand that he won fair and square? Russian interference was negligible. 
t1_duqu3pd	1	*	The headline could be a result of trump openly flaunting his guilt on Twitter.

t1_duqpydj	1	*	Shame it didnt work out with those two, but good for her marrying that Kip Winger guitar player dude....now shes Gates Gates-Winger
t1_duq5cql	0	*	Yes. The TL;DR is that they got charged with tax evasion and failing to register as foreign lobbyists (both occurring before Trump hired them), and then (after Trump hired them) lied about it.
t1_dur9h65	0	*	Yeah, impeach trump for these two idiot's crimes. That makes sense.

t1_duqxts9	0	*	Over a year of investigation and you think they're holding out on charges relating to the election? Maybe they'll find some WMDs in Iraq too?
t1_duquo9m	1	*	During a possible Manafort trial, I wonder how much Gates' credibility will be impacted if defense brings up the fact that Gate lies even during a proffer session.  
t1_duqdxej	0	*	No one sane is saying that. But if this is what he pled to, what else does he know?
t1_duqkmox	0	*	Where's the .8(x) come from? Do Federal crimes automatically have reduced sentences in relation to the abolishion of federal parole?

t1_durfx2r	1	*	It was an interesting week. Manafort/Gates indictments #1&2, Russian indictments, Alex Van der Swann plead guilty, Gates guilty plea. Busy, busy week.
t1_duqos35	1	*	Yes, but they would have to find other evidence to support that charge, his testimony wouldn't be admissable
t1_dur6pr9	1	*	You'd be surprised how few people actually want Hillary to be president. Most dislike both her and Trump.
t1_duqwkh4	1	*	> returned to reality against their will.  Thats a truly wonderful saying. Applies to drugs, crime, kids, relationships.
t1_duqxkl9	1	*	Because reasons involving black people, Jews and muslins. Its all clear, cant you see? Its in Ben Ghazis emails.

t1_duqxcq9	1	*	Lol ok
t1_duqvpem	0	*	It could be looked at like a bad hire.  Something like this could never lead to impeachment.  I doubt even CNN could put that spin on it.

t1_dsoiywa	0	*	Not really. Maybe 20% of Israelis are Arabs, but theres zero chance the opposite is true.
t1_dsod7wl	1	*	So this is what we call an appeal to emotion and moving the goal posts. Review the nonsense above for these logical fallacies.
t1_dsof9wo	0	*	In Goa at least, Russians and Israelis have got a bad reputation. May be that's why.
t1_duk7qh3	1	*	Give a man a fish, so you can tell stories of the fish you gave, long after the man has starved.
t1_duiyp1q	1	*	Plenty of people care, but whatever marching you do is not going to sway these people. Having an effect outside of your own country is difficult, especially when they don't want to change.

t1_dv52r46	1	*	IIRC I'm pretty sure they can get something similar which is technically stopped by the same vaccine?
t1_dty6ml5	1	*	When speaking of something of this scale, percentages hardly matter. Google will fight tooth and nail for even 0.01% of its profit.
t1_ds8lm9p	1	*	How hard is it to get the correct name of an official nominee for an ambassador? I mean damn. When they said drain the swamp, they didnt mean the proofreaders.
t1_dsx92d1	0	*	But there is no barrier in the UK? If they had started offering discounts to a service then capping competing services you'd have a point but... they don't.

t1_dtxcagb	1	*	Figuratively?
t1_dtxf51u	1	*	Yep it is basically legalized slavery.  Qatar does it too.

t1_dtxdicx	1	*	Thats why its called a plot twist
t1_dtxa89i	0	*	Yes, it's so ironic when young western SJWs get upset about anti-Islam sentiments in western countries. They're defending the very thing they think they're opposing.
t1_dtxg5hn	1	*	Yep, if you don't like it, talk to the hand.

t1_dtqgup5	1	*	And that's horrifying, because he wasn't even that connected to the campaign. They used an unrelated person to spy on Trump.
t1_dtpsjaa	0	*	Why is he important? Evidence obtained due to illegal warrants is inadmissible in court. Parallel construction is bad policework.
t1_dtq5evi	1	*	Wut...
t1_dtpyx89	0	*	Or a land war in Asia
t1_dtpt562	0	*	Russian trolls are awake same time as the rest of the (non-US) world, who mostly don't believe anything Trump says. Most of the rest of the world doesn't watch Fox News or read Breitbart.

t1_dtvh9j0	1	*	Maybe you should read about Partisans too. Just saying.
t1_dtog2c4	0	*	Also consider that immigration into Italy and Spain is more recent compared to Northern European countries
t1_dtoghzt	0	*	The world revolves around Murica because I'm on a site dominated by Americans. Every great or horrible event in the world traces back to something that happened in my country. 
t1_dtohvxc	0	*	Not all Lazio fans. Most ultras are extremists, however supporting a football club has nothing to do with politics or ideology.   Forza Lazio!

t1_dtom89l	1	*	That shit really comes to the surface if you stay here a while and interact with the locals (especially over 40). Glad you didn't run into it though and of course not everybody here is like that.

t1_dtoljpe	1	*	That's your white privilege /s
t1_dtoku4a	0	*	No it is not, this is English media talking about something that happened in Italy. In Italian media everyone knew since the first shots that the murder was connected.

t1_dtpe61n	0	*	Reported for offensive language and harassment.

t1_dtpl5u8	0	*	They're still communist (I'm trying to avoid eastern block countries which are a very notable exception-- probably due to very recent hard times)
t1_dtoig1o	0	*	I'd say it varies, in England you have pockets and in NI also, Wales and Scotland less so.
t1_dtq77yq	1	*	Isn't Poland like 99% white

t1_dtonuh3	1	*	He did a lot of good for the nation, the war was just a big mistake
t1_dtohhjl	0	*	> Lots of people in Ireland and England don't consider Eastern Europeans white.  This is ridiculous. What else would they consider them? What are you basing this on? 
t1_dtomukn	1	*	is the mayor supposed to go release a statement after every single murder crime?
t1_dtoqkoi	1	*	Then why did you bring it up?
t1_dtorxbd	1	*	True, but still, no one would support Lazio. 
t1_dtovt5a	1	*	No, its the dishonest kumbaya crowd vs the ugly reality of humanity crowd.  You and I both lock our doors at night, but you like to dishonestly claim no one needs to.
t1_dtoi9b8	0	*	Some are plain fascists, others aren't but they like some ideas of fascism, usally the ones concerning racism
t1_dtorkj3	1	*	Because it was the last time the trains ran on time.

t1_dtoj0n5	1	*	Someone should fly over there, waving the USSR, UK and USA flag, screaming eat shit losers
t1_dtoy5pp	1	*	> because it doesn't seek to achieve a political end  You mean a micro genocide doesn't seek to achieve a political end. A target on a specific group - really?
t1_dub2gcp	0	*	Indeed. I'm not sold on the whole gender is fluid thing, but I still used her because she's presenting as a woman and I think it would be disrespectful to use he.
t1_dsn1rh7	0	*	There's pros and cons. While I wouldn't/didn't feel the fear some others did here, I also wouldn't have been able to say goodbye to the people who matter most.

t1_dsbne9i	1	*	Not to mention the guy was on a walk and just picked it up. 
t1_dt6lece	1	*	In Finland my electric bill per month was around 22 which is about 27$. in Spain the same electric bill was 85 [~+100$)... Spain was pretty cheap otherwise but god damn the electricity was expensive.
t1_dt60ovz	0	*	That still relies on a certain geography.    It would also be more prone to environmental weathering/damage.  So higher maintenance.
t1_dt6irdd	1	*	You'd think, but GPUs are still over priced.
t1_dt64htn	1	*	Actually I find it quite ok that they are using other people's money to save the world.
t1_dt4alq3	0	*	Yes, the AI will do the work. But you're not trying to outrun the bear you are trying to outrun your friend.

t1_dtcdrvr	0	*	Would be great if you could vote this spectacular incompetence out of office. Oh wait, you can't.
t1_dtd181a	0	*	The underlying problem? Government Intervention.
t1_dtc31ro	1	*	There is elements of socialism in Canada, the USA and most of Europe. But with the rise of automation you better damn well hope socialism works.

t1_dtxt8a4	1	*	Shut up you nonce.
t1_dtxfp4p	0	*	> Sum es est, summus estis sunt  This doesn't seem to make much sense.
t1_dtzl1j1	1	*	Oh, i was unaware. Thanks for the explanation.
t1_dtv641z	1	*	Treason? Against whom? He's not a US citizen.
t1_dtu39hj	0	*	He made a mockery of the US and should die for that alone.
t1_dtvgohl	1	*	Generally you'd expect that police that primarily exist to protect the state rather than the people would be better armed. 
t1_dtupccp	1	*	Well it would help if he didn't, you know, flee the country to avoid a rape trial. 
t1_dtrxc0j	1	*	Fun quotes aside, the humanitarian crisis we have today is the change he was looking at.
t1_dunh55m	1	*	Vice has changed a lot since inception
t1_dumgq4h	0	*	As have I. Then you know as well as I do they have gone downhill with some of the writers they have now. And reporters.
t1_dscv7ig	0	*	So... go to a CLOSED border (Egypt/Gaza) or one controlled by Israel, where these exact rules will apply (Jordan/West Bank)?
t1_dscdaok	1	*	We will convince them of our peaceful ways BY FORCE!
t1_dsj2edg	0	*	There are things called elections where you can do exactly that. 
t1_dss7943	1	*	Russia is already a close ally with Iran, who is at odds with Saudi Arabia.   Hard to imagine the US being out muscled or having SA switch camps if Russia is in the game.
t1_dv4qr88	0	*	So you're not a fan, I get that, but would you rather having have him setting records for executive orders like Obama did or playing golf.       I'll take golf over the last presidents actions.

t1_dsujhf9	0	*	No, because I dont buy their games. Stop buying shitty games and getting mad when theyre shit
t1_dv3e9vz	1	*	Point is we're all focused on Russia because Hillary had a document from a UK spy packaged for the FBI. Seems more like she's making a puff of smoke to reduce the focus from her
t1_dv2zldj	0	*	I thought saying one of you to people of other cultures was frowned upon now?  You guys still rockin' that racism xenophobia type shit?
t1_dv2nmyl	1	*	I get that, I just think the voters they represent should be able to decide each cycle.
t1_dv3k5yr	0	*	Can you show me that you understand the issue?  How would gun rights advocates answer the question of why gun rights are important?
t1_dv3ebip	1	*	Yes. Shoot someone then point that you think someone else might have shot someone and we'll just focus on what's most recent not most substantial
t1_dv2drxd	0	*	Money is free speech. Just as saying, we won't vote for you if you don't approve certain legislation, is also not bribery. 
t1_dv3hasq	1	*	Top kek
t1_dv2gqm8	1	*	Well yeah.... Russia didn't help republicans rig 2012. That's the difference. 
t1_dv2gy3l	1	*	As I've said elsewhere, I sometimes feel my vote is in handcuffs

t1_dv2b58s	0	*	You seem to miss my point entirely. Party ideology has never been coherent.
t1_dv2dblu	1	*	It would also have been nice if Obama hadn't used one of his nominations to appoint that authoritarian shithead Elena Kagan to the supreme court.
t1_dv35xgz	1	*	Hence the alt-rights distain for Antifa (Anti-Fascism)
t1_dv3bxoy	1	*	But what if Jim is a Russian spy.....
t1_dv3y4p4	1	*	We can't say the same about the democratic party?  Oh, you sweet summer child.  Pro abortion, pro confiscation, LGBTQ+, unionization, etc.  Gosh, you're new to this.
t1_dv2j7al	1	*	But if you are a single issue voter on guns, you more than likely hold the same position on the other things you listed.
t1_dv2pbsb	1	*	>Can someone answer the question instead of just downvoting me?  In this subreddit? Oh you sweet summer child.

t1_dv2nki1	0	*	> Shouldn't you also be able to pool resources to affect change?  I don't think so. 
t1_dv2ijff	1	*	Well yeah but they're also antifa. So it's confusing.
t1_dv2f3xm	1	*	They don't create the shit, they take advantage of already existing divides. 
t1_dv2uzkm	1	*	We should, look what happened in Bernie's campaign, people want it... How do you form the lobby groups or be a certified lobbyist? REDDIT LEGAL TEAM ASSEMBLE... But really..
t1_dv2ahvs	1	*	I mean, he put wealthy Americans first.   
t1_dv2ied2	1	*	I would say the same thing can be said about the Democratic party, flipping the side on all those issues.
t1_dv2fxq1	1	*	!goodbot
t1_dv2n179	1	*	I think the evil genius of their pursuit of single-issue voters is that there are lots of issues they can use to attract voters.  It's a long-tail approach for marketing  hatred and bigotry.
t1_dv34qod	1	*	I'm sure they would beg not to be persons then. 
t1_dv37jtk	1	*	They don't know, all they do is post the gish-gallops that their writers write for them.

t1_dv2hgu5	0	*	Illegal foreign contributions to a Presidential Campaign. Violation of FEC laws.
t1_dv2g4y4	1	*	This is the same for both parties.  There are extremists on both sides.  There are also many voters who fall into the middle but vote for a certain party because of single issues.
t1_dv2g5jb	1	*	So what about the unions who gave over a billion dollars to democrats. You wanna talk about pay for play? Jesus.
t1_dv2g3xh	1	*	Reminded me of the radio advert in GTA for the group Citizens United Negating Technology For Life And People's Safety
t1_dv2pvxn	0	*	This is why I hate the 2 political party system.  The only way they know how to define themselves is against the other. 
t1_dv2fid2	1	*	Your right but the same could be said for many Dems too. Pro abortion, gay marriage, gun control, etc.
t1_dv2i51k	1	*	There are differents lobbying, the one where you don't give money nor advantages to politicians and the other one that is called corruption.
t1_dv3hqfz	0	*	And giving them a lifespan. Sorry, your company has 120 years max to live. After 60 or so it just can't do what it used to do.... around 90 it's just sitting around getting excited about pudding. 
t1_dt93opq	0	*	Any one of those 42 could feed and shelter millions of those starving third world peoples. The ten bucks in pocket could not. But somehow you think they are the same? Your math seems a bit off.

t1_dul984d	1	*	Unplug their TV.

t1_dujr4jx	1	*	Sure they are, but the plausible deniability they are given by a man who claims to be mentally fit but actually isn't is too good for them to pass up for as long as this lasts.
t1_dujn80q	1	*	You assume they can read at all. That's cute
t1_dujn5d8	0	*	So even a flat-out lie is now a matter for semantic analysis?
t1_dujm7d5	1	*	How has he not been physically injured over some of these big shady deals that went wrong?
t1_dujmpgs	1	*	He called it a hoax. Does hoax mean something that might have happened or does hoax mean a humorous or malicious deception?
t1_duk354v	1	*	That's why I'm wary when people like Oprah are hyped for candidates. What about somebody who already spent a few years or more in government and kinda knows what they're doing.
t1_dujv4h3	1	*	That's actually a good point though. I hate the man, but that point is fair
t1_dujsin8	0	*	America is just so great that you first have to screw things up to have something you can fix /s
t1_dujoxgc	1	*	How is bugging Carter Page the same as bugging Trump Tower?
t1_dujkr64	1	*	That's true but in order to impeach him he must first be caught committing a crime.  That doesn't mean they have to impeach him though.
t1_dujirzo	0	*	Ah yes, the Narcissist's prayer. Very appropriate!
t1_dujujuv	1	*	It's tremendous!
t1_dujlvi6	1	*	Of course that comparison is strange.   Glad we got that out of the way. Feel free to be yourself now.
t1_duk3wh5	1	*	>IS THAT A JOJOKE?  >^^^^...  FTFY
t1_dujvok0	1	*	So you're saying that even if Russia *colluded* we should keep our mouth shut?  Do you actually think that Russia would start WWIII over the US criticizing their government?
t1_dujnpby	1	*	Welcome to the darkest timeline.

t1_dujlz9w	0	*	Yes. He seems to admit there is a collusion, but then denies the collusion in other tweets.
t1_dujhhh0	0	*	Worst.
t1_dulm6w4	0	*	He didn't say collusion, he said the whole thing. You understand that you don't even have a basic fucking understanding of what you are even talking about, right? 
t1_dujjsm9	0	*	It actually is. Saying trump is not a liar would be fake news. Balanced news doesnt mean using fake news but using different sources of different political sides.
t1_dukh5lz	1	*	Whatever you say cowboy, whatever you say.

t1_dujkx7i	1	*	So when someone says to you that a country meddled in an election, you first assume Facebook trolls instead of something serious like hacking voter machines?
t1_dujn1s5	0	*	When does my bonus get here? I've yet to see an additional dime.  All I'm seeing is the dismantling of our country's institutions.
t1_dujnf19	1	*	Like clockwork. Anytime a trump supporter is shown something they cant defend they just post a meme. Never a counter arguement. Never a defensive stance. Just a meme. 
t1_dujwbzi	1	*	There is [What the Fuck Just Happened Today?](https://whatthefuckjusthappenedtoday.com/all/)
t1_dujl65u	1	*	Wait, whose boots am I supposed to be licking? 
t1_duk2ea9	0	*	And those voters in his base are listening to conservative news/ talk shows who protect Trump, refuse to talk about his blatant lies, and the Russian interference. 
t1_dulcgbu	1	*	Well where's your sources then?   You can't just claim otherwise and provide nothing. Otherwise its just nuh uh

t1_dtk4o7s	1	*	I was properly circumcised and I care that i dont have my foreskin. 
t1_dtjpm9e	1	*	Because you are American. If you grew up outside America, Israel or the middle east, everyone would have their turtlenecks besides the arab kid.
t1_dtja7ub	0	*	So would you be for allowing the removal of the clitoral hoods and the labia of infant girls so they don't produce smegma either?
t1_dtj2bko	0	*	Dry masturbation is the number one cause of retarded ejaculation in men.  Stop watching so much porn and wanking with your dry hands, it desensitizes your penis over time.
t1_dtizjj9	0	*	So you are saying because I'm a Jew I can only see problems?
t1_dtj6jqk	0	*	Do they give pain meds when its done at the hospital? As far as I know, no pain meds given for a Jewish circumcision.

t1_dtld6nk	0	*	No, cut people are just oversensitive about the practice of infant circumcision being criticised. 
t1_dtj3j8j	1	*	Choose between:   - circumcision - ability to move forward   Hmm tough choice
t1_dtjbiyi	0	*	He's saying that parents are doing it for cosmetic reasons, not that foreskin is solely cosmetic.
t1_dtkurik	1	*	Clitoral hood circumcision is removing the clitoriss hood, which is similar to the peniss foreskin.  Theyre exactly comparable.
t1_dtjihdt	1	*	I've never been with a circumcised  guy.  I didn't even realise it was a thing until a girlfriend of mine dated a Jewish guy and was talking about it. I found it rather strange at the time.
t1_dtkd7pj	0	*	You jealous bro?  I mean doesn't mutilation decrease somethings appearance? If anything it's cosmetic. That would make it the opposite. 
t1_dtjv0kr	0	*	Why do you think there seems to be little dedication to the actual science in this policy? 
t1_dtjj36n	1	*	Virtually no one would talk about this to their friends or even family. It's a private matter. Chances are you know someone that would prefer to be intact.
t1_dtjeyjn	0	*	We could eliminate breast cancer with obligatory mastectomies at 13 y.o.
t1_dtjnl8x	0	*	Poor sentence structure you mean.
t1_dtkyoz1	1	*	Because it's the general opinion you hear in the US. I didn't say each and every female so don't go getting all offended and technical.
t1_dtk8b65	1	*	Circumcision isn't not a must in Islam (with the exception of the shiites that consider it as a requirement)
t1_dtl3sg2	1	*	>clean look.      Im circumcised and it looks disgusting compared to foreskin.
t1_dtitbv9	0	*	So is it cosmetic or is it a religious marker? If it's cosmetic, don't be playing the faith i am no longer part of card. 
t1_dtjgyya	1	*	Interestingly, he also thought that eating bland foods like Cornflakes would prevent masturbation.
t1_dtjfssb	0	*	Shit, the one friend I had who we knew WASN'T circumcised was harassed more than any of us.
t1_dtkcssg	1	*	It's genital mutilation, cut and dry.
t1_dtjhpcy	1	*	Nobody in real life is going to bring this up, duh. I'm cut and hate it but I'm not going to bring that up with anyone IRL.
t1_dtj4x5z	1	*	I will second this. I never see anyone actually say that, ever.
t1_dtjhx35	1	*	Poor you.
t1_dtjy37l	1	*	To never know pleasure of a girl nibbling the foreskin
t1_dtjnn2q	0	*	Man, what a party pooper. 
t1_dtjpeou	0	*	If as an adult you stop and think, man that's gonna hurt then don't even fucking consider doing it on a kid.
t1_dtjasrb	1	*	What you can do is try to prevent it from happening again, really. To you or others.
t1_dtjb3vg	0	*	That is a stupid line of thinking for all the medical procedures anyone under 18 can't really consent to without a parent. It isn't mutilation, so it isn't that simple.
t1_dtjfnzw	1	*	Damn, I'm sorry bro.  
t1_dtkatti	0	*	How is that relevant?
t1_dtj8w7s	1	*	I appreciate the honesty.

t1_dtjwjuh	0	*	> There are so many benefits to circumcision  like what 
t1_dtjipfx	0	*	That was the point. 
t1_dtl0kex	0	*	The type I underwent is considered FGM in the west. 
t1_dtj7air	1	*	Not mine though. 
t1_dtlcztw	0	*	And yet a vast majority of Jews consider it perfectly acceptable and do it.
t1_dtjp26p	1	*	Sorry to hear that
t1_dtka6nk	1	*	>Female mutilation involves cutting the clitoris and labia  It doesnt't   FGM is also jsut cutting the clitorial hood. Like the pensi foreskin.  Cutting the clitorial hood is forbidden by law.
t1_dtjbofo	1	*	#AllPenisesMatter
t1_dto5y29	0	*	Because my dick is ugly and has reduced functionality because of a procedure which, if it had been delayed just a little, would have been medical malpractice. I want to protect other boys from that. 
t1_dtjj7z7	1	*	Well originally it was a form of humiliation, a practice used on slaves thousands of years ago.  A symbolic castration of male slaves.  Which is kind of funny. 
t1_dtiyurg	1	*	Those reasons are very, very rare. The vast majority of circumcisions are due to religious or cosmetic reasons.
t1_dtiwhbu	1	*	Yeah I wholeheartedly agree. It's irreversible. My comment wasn't to imply everyone should have it done, just that it works for me. 
t1_dtj6fxm	0	*	> Because ~~having an intact foreskin~~ not washing your dick increases the risk of getting yeast infections.  Ftfy

t1_dtjkjs8	0	*	Why couldn't they repair it, or just let the edges heal?  A dorsal slit is one of the options for phimosis anyway...
t1_dtjiikt	1	*	For your 2nd point check out /r/Foregen. According to their timeline they'll be ready in 2-3 years.
t1_dtj5z53	0	*	circumcised penises stink if you don't shower too. 
t1_dtiu4k1	1	*	Yeah, just a big seam across your junk because baby Jesus wants to see that dickhead....nothing weird about *that.*
t1_dtk1yjb	1	*	Cant imagine the women you hang around with, then LOL
t1_dtl17hk	1	*	It leads to argument because they were cut and didn't have a choice. It is a black pride movement. I didn't choose to be this way so I must prove it is better.
t1_dtjz3ee	1	*	Dang, I was circumcised as a child and I'm lucky if last past insertion, but I'm happy with being circumcised . I don't like turtle necks on either of my heads.
t1_dtjfy9x	0	*	That's right. It's an anti-masturbatory cracker.
t1_dtjub14	1	*	>too much skin was removed  Yea... Don't remove any, it's fine the way it is.  Source: I'm English, we don't do that, why the fuck do you lot across the pond still do this shit? 
t1_dtjjcp5	1	*	Sometimes stupid Redditors have to be able to read into the context of the actual statements posted.  At no point did I call you stupid either...
t1_duj43t1	1	*	Dont you know that the earth's core is over 5000 xb0C? And that the amount of energy necessary to heat the earth's core and crust, for it to expand is nigh impossible for humans to create?

t1_dt1vawe	1	*	We're on a message board what the fuck else do you expect people to do here?
t1_dt1r2w7	1	*	All I can say is I think Trump and Obama are very different people. And I think their governments are very different too.
t1_dt2pks4	1	*	And she was appointed by a CLINTON!  The plot thickens!
t1_dt1emi6	1	*	Pretty sure this _is_ Putin's plan.  
t1_dt1exqw	0	*	Aka kushnering
t1_dt1fu79	1	*	Definitely.   I think the bank is causing more suspicion than Kushners name though.   Most are aware of Deutsches Russian money laundering charges. 
t1_dt2r45u	1	*	So what? He then perjures and obstructs, gets convicted and Don Trump or Pence pardons him again? Is there any federal charge that would stick?
t1_dt2n9ol	1	*	If that is how it works that would be funny as shit for the smartest man in the world. 
t1_dt15erd	1	*	The presidential pardon only applies to federal charges, not state.
t1_dt2n874	1	*	I shouldn't laugh at this but that is pretty damn funny. 
t1_dt0rgie	0	*	It's not about collusion, we've seen it with Clinton and Monica. That started with the Whitewater investigation but ended in Perjury.  
t1_dt1b917	1	*	>I doubt most Trump supporters know or care who Jared is.  Much more accurate.
t1_dt0s2g6	1	*	I dont think the normal family has the amount of skeletons as this family does. Theyre kinda screwing over the American people.

t1_dsinynx	0	*	Nah Israelis prefer to just burn the kid 
t1_dsimpcf	0	*	I know a guy who went, he had the time of his life. He felt safer than he did in parts of Europe. That being said he is darker skinned (Latino), not sure if that's a factor. 
t1_dsjh517	1	*	This fight started out of nowhere. 
t1_dsj0z35	0	*	I just thought it was Ironic.  Seeing all these people who love James Franco freaking out that he might be a fucking creep.  Which doesn't make him the worst person ever by any stretch.
t1_dsjhppz	0	*	Probably black humor
t1_dsiuzyy	1	*	No. It does not. The few occurences you've heard of are extra-judicial and there's almost always an outcry against it, it's just bribery and stuff that's the actual problem. 
t1_dsj4sy1	1	*	They're humans.

t1_dv0lu29	0	*	The thunderbone?  But really i was imagining some cages and food and work with a rescue specialist.  Do yall not have dog rescues?
t1_dv1a18y	1	*	You are right, and there is no one who is willing to take these dogs, that can also give them the structure and and attention they require. 
t1_duq437s	1	*	You know what I mean :)  And 90% of reddit couldn't pronounce either of those names.  Im only salty because Hope and Dependable are worlds apart.

t1_dv0pr3p	1	*	Yes, they were free last year for Canada's 150th anniversary. Not free the years before that.
t1_dv0a4c7	1	*	That's a major attraction of BC's southern hwy, very busy during the summer. The price is likely set as a filter to keep a % of tourists out.
t1_dv0fpq9	0	*	Your country is lovely. But not being able to drive an hour and be utterly *alone* is not something that I could deal with.  
t1_dv09tgz	0	*	No they're not, you're just an idiot. If someone with half a brain see's the headline Country makes X free they're going to infer that they've made X free *within that country*
t1_dv033dc	1	*	But wouldn't you have had a much more rewarding experience if you'd been allowed to ski alone? The presence of a parent on the back of the skis detracts substantially from the experience.
t1_dv12zom	1	*	No problem! I also forgot to mention to be very conscious of not leaving food out. As soon as you are done eating you wanna put your food away.

t1_dv1am2r	1	*	I thought we'd been strongly against banning them throughout the controversy? 
t1_dv0w587	0	*	Ah yes because no country outside of US has massive corporations that put money before the environment. Thanks for clearing that up.
t1_dv11fi5	1	*	Wave tactics
t1_dv0ve7m	1	*	Isn't the issue that glyphosate itself is safe, but the surfactant used in the end product is not?
t1_dv0tsnn	1	*	I was speaking in general terms... not specific to this one thing. Get off your high horse.
t1_dv0qvoq	1	*	anyone who doesn't know. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W33HRc1A6c
t1_dv109aa	0	*	It's in toothpaste??
t1_dv0ysy8	1	*	They support it for political expediency, not because they believe in it.
t1_dv0rbyn	1	*	It took 3 comments for someone to mention Brexit. Good job. Never mind that the UK has several of the world's top universities, nope. 
t1_dv0rsyk	1	*	Swizerland isn't in the EU, immigration there is super duper strict from what I recall.
t1_dv11vra	1	*	I thought maybe some people wouldn't know what a Brexiteer was.  Edit: Yeah, fuck me, right?
t1_dv0sjxw	0	*	Well, [it does](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_organism#History). No need to be an asshole if you're going to use the wrong word.   *Transgenic*
t1_dv1ics1	0	*	Would it be correct to say that glyphosate itself is safe, but the surfactant used in the final product is not?
t1_dv27h8t	1	*	It also effects solitary bees, they make up a larger proportion of our bee species and pollinators. 
t1_dv0sw9u	0	*	When did that happen? Any archives of those studies?
t1_dv0p9wc	1	*	He really is so I am hopefully. 
t1_dv0upxq	1	*	Everything I said was correct.  I've been here since the start of the thread and watched you Monsanto drones descend on it.  Go drink some round-up, it's good for you.
t1_dv0y1t0	0	*	Yes, but disastrously so? Paying 10% more is really different than 100% more
t1_dv0v3da	0	*	Except that, again, the EFSA (and every other scientific and regulatory safety body) concluded the exact opposite to be the case.
t1_dv0vlwy	1	*	Oh, good grief....
t1_dv0qcjl	1	*	Thanks!
t1_dv0u43s	1	*	But we're supporting the ban...

t1_dv10fq1	1	*	Theres some black comedy about this administrations approach to Africanized bees to be had here. 
t1_dv13tes	1	*	Its caused by nitrogen and phosphorus that cause hypoxia creating a deadzone. Pesticides arent good in water systems either but this dead zone, and others, are cause by fertilizer. 
t1_dv0phvc	1	*	[Relevant](https://imgur.com/a/6NJ8g)
t1_dv16rbb	0	*	Indian rainbow dancing wtf? 
t1_dv0vfr3	1	*	can hold sway, not always.  the GMO thing is stupid.
t1_dv0z2j2	0	*	Roundup is a herbicide. And glyphosate has been confirmed, by the EFSA even that made the above decision, to be among the least harmful pesticides out there. 
t1_dv0rwwj	1	*	Yes because them not making money is specifically about this one issue. Brexit was driven purely because of pesticide usage and the EU can't tell us what to do!
t1_dv0yl06	1	*	We're lucky that it comes down to preference then.
t1_dv0t3wt	1	*	I did not know this. Thank you.

t1_dtarbrx	1	*	Put up or shut up Kim
t1_du8865l	0	*	Well for example in Prague the public transport is already heavily subsidized. Tickets and yearly passes are only 20% of the public transport budget. Pretty sure its similar in other EU cities. 
t1_du8viyh	1	*	Ah ok, that makes sense, I thought you just didn't like a pay once - go as far as you want system (like in Moscow I think)
t1_du8vw53	1	*	In fact you should be paid a wage for attending university as you are literally educated to become a member of a company that makes them money. You should not subsidize their labor market.
t1_du9zc87	1	*	Yeah I wish they would :)!
t1_du8uf8i	0	*	MTA in NY was awesome. Leaving a bar at 4AM and hopping on the L was easy. We got back in 20 minutes. Compared to Marta in Atlanta, it was unbelievable how well you could get around.

t1_du9axdd	0	*	WHAT.  There is ZERO public transportation in like 95% of the US. You must live in NYC or LA.
t1_du996dx	1	*	I don't think either of those actually count as public transportation.  At least, in the sense of public funds, management, and infrastructure as I'd define it.  Thinking more like buses and trains.
t1_du8zgac	1	*	At my University its not mandatory to pay the ticket. U just have to tell them that u dont want it. Its in no way needed for studying here.
t1_du97tt0	1	*	Yeah, leaving Europe even to relatively good transit like here in SF is like waking from a dream.  Basically a recipe for spending your spare minutes looking at photos of European cities.  
t1_dua486n	1	*	Europe has been doing this for a long time...but as well, Europe has universal healthcare and gun control
t1_dua1trg	0	*	These tickets usually cover a much larger area than just the city though. Like the whole federal state.
t1_du8dtxf	1	*	> it's taxes all the way down  Don't Forget to finally die, so we can tax whatever you had left!  
t1_du8rc8o	1	*	My city has terrible public transportation. 
t1_du8m7i9	1	*	The point of public transport is to get rid of extra cars.  So we have a choice:  public transport or more roads, road maintenance, traffic cops, etc.  
t1_du89iqy	1	*	Maybe in the USA or some other country where the public travel infrastructure is mostly poorly developed (yes, there are a few exceptions in the USA which is why I said mostly).
t1_du888o2	0	*	> That's why I love public transport in countries like Japan  http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-01-07/women-subjected-to-daily-trauma-on-tokyo-subway-gropers/8166672

t1_dug9las	1	*	I think actively trying to provoke a civil war in another country is different from meddling in their elections to get a friendly puppet elected. That's where the distinction comes from.
t1_duh9uz8	0	*	So because the meddling only indirectly affected the election, you don't care?  Why does it matter so much that the result was a direct affevtrather than an indirect one for you to care about it?

t1_dsmrg6m	0	*	If you don't want to read stuff like Sir Gawain and the Green Knight or The Lady of Shalott, there's a show called Merlin on Netflix that's close enough I guess. 
t1_dsmd2xl	1	*	What Trump represent would be illegal in most of European democracies. So when he is in the spotlight, he reminds us of a side of the USA that disgust us.
t1_dsmok03	1	*	Considering he keeps the two ends together using a piece of tape, I'd say that is entirely accurate. How the man doesn't just buy a tie bar and be done with it, I don't understand.
t1_dsmozg1	0	*	https://petition.parliament.uk/archived/petitions/171928  Not a Facebook petition.
t1_dsmregm	1	*	I mean Trump kind of sadly does speak for us. It's fucked up and I hate it but he his our ambassador to the world

t1_dsme4dy	1	*	That really sums up their philosophy in general
t1_dsmi7vh	0	*	I'm actually genuinely curious if he openly converted to Christianity would that be good enough for some people.  but religious prejudice is probably just an excuse for plain simple racism. 
t1_dsmxzbj	1	*	I thought porn was the german flag or if you like anime japanese flags
t1_dsmp9uh	0	*	Well it's not the articles fault you made wildly absurd assumptions. Some trump supporters trying to assault the mayor of London because he is muslim/brown is still news.
t1_dsn7o1z	1	*	Source?
t1_dsman2c	0	*	Why are you talking like Khan decided whether trump could visit or not?  He speaks for London, because that's his fucking job.

t1_du54y53	1	*	Whats stopping you?

t1_du0vdlw	1	*	I dont get the reference.

t1_ds3lfit	1	*	Well we have GREAT educators in those field.  Thing is: people don't go into them due to how hard they are.
t1_ds3ow94	1	*	Because Trumpism is racism. If the title says 'Europeans' instead 'Indians', the reaction will be vastly different.   Trump knows how to use racism. 
t1_ds3jnlm	1	*	Edit: Guy above me said that we are choosing the best candidates from India, the 'cream of the crop' if you will here in America.   It's a lottery. We aren't picking much of anything.

t1_dtpz1vm	0	*	No? How about never stop checking? That's the whole point of a democracy. You can't only accept results you like, true, but you also have to keep considering results more than once...
t1_dtqpji9	0	*	We elect the members of the European Parliament directly. Strategic decisions are taken by the Presidents and the Ministers of the 28 member states. How is the European Union not democratic?

t1_dtq9rmx	0	*	Exactly, you elect the representatives who govern the country. You don't govern it by referendum.   Brexit *should* be nothing more than the opinion poll it was.
t1_dtrgmfx	0	*	I think recent reports show that even if what you're saying is true, Britain still gain so much from the EU economically that it's more than worth it.
t1_dtrfzwm	1	*	Actually it wouldn't, we have a representative democracy. Meaning we vote in people to make decisions for us. A referendum if anything is against the democratic system we have in place.

t1_dv29mdu	1	*	Fine with me. We remove the usa from the Berne Convention. Goodbye international recognition of us copyrights, etc.
t1_dv1pj17	1	*	Yes
t1_dv1wfwm	0	*	Yeah there's a whole load of things Canada has that the USA wants and the USA has that Canada wants. This is why it's always been important to maintain a good relationship. 
t1_dv2hl0a	1	*	Oh man, nooooooooo pwobwem!
t1_dv1ta26	1	*	Yep but I'll be working those long hours salaried till it does bust. 
t1_dv1vlyx	1	*	Makes sense, thanks!
t1_dv22snq	1	*	Stop selling Trump weed, because he has to be smoking a lot of it for this policy to sound like a good idea for anybody.
t1_dv1tj8s	1	*	China doesn't import enough to have as much of an impact. If they weren't dumping steel there would be no tariff. We need a domestic steel and aluminum industry for national security reasons. 
t1_dv29q23	1	*	He wants to fuck his daughter, not his niece 
t1_dv26lxk	0	*	Funny, I say the same thing in regards to the fast food industry and how these people want $15 an hour or a living wage for a job a computer can do and the left attack me.   
t1_dv2dkpz	0	*	Well yeah, but if it expands the job market in the rust belt, it'll help that beleaguered area out, even if it hurts the job market in other areas. 
t1_dv335vh	0	*	Would that be considered foreign interference in our elections?
t1_dv1wht2	1	*	poor snowflakes.
t1_dv1nsvt	0	*	Apologize for that.
t1_dv1ywbl	1	*	His pension... That is beyond fucked up. 
t1_dv23vfo	1	*	The thing is, this only works if the president cares about votes.

t1_dv32da3	1	*	We already do...  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural_subsidy#United_States
t1_dv25mcs	1	*	You guessed correctly about the PhD from Harvard.  Scroll half way down and find Tyler Goodspeed  Link: Council of Economic Advisors to the president. https://www.whitehouse.gov/cea/staff/
t1_dv2n9xp	1	*	> My approach, I just ended up turning every country I played into Canada.  Until you can turn it into Norway you haven't completed the game.
t1_dv25npc	0	*	Wait, so shouldn't my price for milk have gone down? Why haven't I seen an adjustment in price if theres a glut in the market?
t1_dv1od31	0	*	It was probably mostly a shipment cost at best 
t1_dv239qs	1	*	Hmm. Something tells me the markets are going to accelerate downwards for the next couple days. My opinion is the odds are high the markets plummet 25% by Tuesday. I'm selling stocks tomorrow. 
t1_dv1qr8s	1	*	To be fair, he would have won the last election even without Florida. 
t1_dv1faxi	0	*	Now foreign companies invest in US steel production to avoid the tariff, then job creation in the US follows 
t1_dv1rkd6	0	*	Can I get a source?            I'd like the details on that tastey sound bite, but a quick Googling didn't get me much (presumably cause I don't have enough info to find it). 
t1_dv2cnon	1	*	I hope there's a CIV Ghandhi somewhere IRL now lol
t1_dv1t3y6	1	*	He didn't use it in a sentence, he quoted it.  
t1_dv1vq2e	1	*	Literally that speech would get him voted back in again by his supporters
t1_dv1g704	0	*	The ones from the brits? Who are now little more than Americas pet.
t1_dv1lcf2	0	*	No way man. Steel is bad for the environment. We should all use Hemp instead for everything...........jk
t1_dv22bsc	0	*	Yeah that's kinda why the whole point is to get America to start producing things again....
t1_dv1vnme	1	*	You realize that in the year since Trump has taken office our foreign trade deficit has increased by 13% to a 9 year high, right?
t1_dv1gkbi	1	*	I'd say stupidity is even stronger and further reaching. 
t1_dv1wt40	0	*	Of course it is your fault.  Dont you know how to sell??  Always be closing.     /s
t1_dv28az3	1	*	Except... it didnt last time.
t1_dv27ov5	1	*	You mean Europe, not China
t1_dv271nt	1	*	Hilary tried to impose sad tariffs but I shut them down with my big hands!  *his followers obediently lap it up*
t1_dv1wq8d	1	*	Help who? People who still act like Trump is capable of... anything are fucking delusional. No one cares if it helps them. 
t1_dv202zl	1	*	Or you guys could go back even further and rebel against your tyrannical government, claim your own sovereignty and become allies with Canada, or maybe even join us. 
t1_dv1ty9u	1	*	It will still somehow be Obamas fault. 
t1_dv1q10i	1	*	I'd like sources for that as well. A very interesting topic.
t1_dv1yvwy	1	*	Now, if we could only find Psychologists who wouldn't accept millions of dollars in bribes....   I wish your idea would work but im doubtful.
t1_dv1z3pq	0	*	Great my company uses a lot of steel.... I may be fucked 
t1_dv1ts0s	1	*	How is steel a dying industry? Worldwide consumption is at all time highs.
t1_dv1jgbl	1	*	But prices will still rise because domestic producers no longer have to compete on price with cheaper foreign steel.
t1_dv3l7u3	1	*	A Trumpwreck is what the US is going to be. He destroys all he touches. He's the midas of shit 
t1_dv1qejo	0	*	Do Harley Davidson exports to China really have that much of an impact on Wisconsin's economy?
t1_dv24vkv	1	*	All his base belong to US.
t1_dv1xygc	1	*	No, no younger siblings...I love all this stuff though and I'm going to major in Poli sci so I'm trying to absorb as much about everything as I can lol 
t1_dv2a79y	1	*	Its best described as election meddling. They want to provoke an outcome of the election which is detrimental to a particular party.
t1_dv2gtpe	1	*	I don't retract my comment, it just doesn't apply to you.
t1_dv1sorc	1	*	So we need to give an extra 20% apology? 
t1_dv21pvb	1	*	It was Clinton who gave China most favored nation status. It took a neoliberal to fuck up any opposition to destroying those manufacturing jobs.  
t1_dv23h9a	1	*	Pathetic
t1_dv22z2s	0	*	i do live in the now. But trump is stupider then Bush and it didnt go well for Bush so...

t1_dstrtte	0	*	Trump's administration brought the regs in!
t1_dt0yogw	0	*	While it definitely is understandable, it also does not deescalate the situation.  Well, the hanging does in a way, but punching back is unlikely to.
t1_dt0luq2	0	*	Why couldn't he be a diabolical genocidal dictator who's crazy. 
t1_dt1wpaj	1	*	>This blows my mind.   That's not the only thing that was blown.
t1_dt0sxfl	0	*	Even camera footage can be a bit shady now. With modern video editing software, it is now relatively easy to manipulate footage and say, put a new face on a person or remove an object from a room.
t1_dt1b5ix	1	*	You can post as long as you don't mind getting downvoted
t1_dt17dgx	0	*	I shouldn't be laughing at this.  But I am. 
t1_dt0jpw1	0	*	The second one.  
t1_dt0t2hh	0	*	It is almost as if different people go into different topics relevant to their interest and vote!
t1_dt1zm6t	0	*	I was mainly referring to American white collar crime.
t1_dt0llng	1	*	I like that rationale. No to the death penalty, but they deserve what they have coming to them. 
t1_dt125sm	0	*	yeah... but when I hate someone I might want them dead but that would be kind of a fucked up thing to wish on someone
t1_dt0up3m	1	*	And to German laws. 
t1_dt0w87q	1	*	I would say by definition only sane people can be evil
t1_dt1kje3	1	*	Don't say that about the heroic Red Army in the Great Patriotic War, tovarich!  You might hurt some leftists' feelings if you think gangraping the women of your enemies is wrong.
t1_dt1japc	0	*	Is it? Always made sense to me. Because they saw naked hate speech completely misused in the interwar. 
t1_dt0jdui	0	*	So someone was saying = hivemind now?
t1_dt239rk	1	*	There's nothing regardless.
t1_dt12ohu	1	*	And that will cost you 10,000,000 tax bucks
t1_dt0oi1h	1	*	Why is that?
t1_dt16zbc	1	*	Typically, if you are white and do something terrible, you're insane. If you're not and you do, then you're an ideologue.
t1_dt1i5zl	0	*	She went to join Islamic State, so why consider her German any more?
t1_dt0uj7k	1	*	Maybe. It has hard to predict how I would react. But luckily that is why we have judges who should decide. 
t1_dt1ck8w	1	*	>calling someone a coward  >talking shit over the internet  pick one 
t1_dt0vypi	1	*	Or retarded
t1_dt11881	1	*	Yes, she literally joined a terrorist organization.
t1_dt0y2l7	1	*	Negative ghost rider.
t1_dt0j7l0	0	*	Right? It's supposed to be okay because the Iraqies are on our side? No, death penalty is bad no matter who you are.

t1_dugeg03	1	*	So can we Germans get Poland back? Like you know, Polands got a part of Germany after ww2
t1_dug5gav	1	*	Appears to be about 1.2% of the budget in 2017.  **Israeli budget in USD (roughly):** `$256 billion`   **US Aid to Israel in USD (roughly):** `$3.1 billion`
t1_dugcplt	1	*	Are Anglo-Saxons giving their land back?  Or is the popular vote still that only the US is made up of people who stole land?
t1_dugcdsp	1	*	Gets you a good score in Pointless, that's for sure.

t1_dugce0o	1	*	Wait? So they fuck up the move? I liked comics version..... 
t1_dug8d7n	1	*	Maybe consider taking up the law and see how far you get? 
t1_dugcdja	1	*	And the above poster selectively left out the fact that it's a monstrous cement WALL, not some chickenshit chainlinked fence. 
t1_dugb4r9	0	*	Just put up walls and limit the food and water that gets to an entire peoples. Wonder what guy did that to the jews?? 
t1_dugc7ku	0	*	I guess if you've always wanted to go on vacation in a war zone....

t1_dugbl0t	1	*	If you burn your fingerprints off they grow back different.
t1_dugcv4i	1	*	You may have been thinking of the Lemba. But that would be a hell of a trek. 
t1_dugbknu	1	*	. . . I thought you were joking. They actually have an AK-47 on their flag. WTF.
t1_dugcp8f	0	*	Read the article. They are illegal, they aren't Jewish. They're illegal economic migrants. 
t1_dug1z19	0	*	And it almost never ends with them.
t1_dugbvzu	0	*	He was making a joke based off of your post, not trying to go against you on anything. Hahaha way to go, bud. 
t1_dugd9yz	1	*	The fence is big af. They also have a lot of border patrol and a minefield.
t1_dugcljz	0	*	What?
t1_dugc9sr	0	*	The ones getting deported in Israel were illegal. 
t1_dugfg4m	0	*	Read that and it said they had to sell their things to be shipped off. How is that the same as Israel giving them money and transportation? 
t1_dugbq3k	0	*	But did Sudan pay for that fence? Checkmate!
t1_dugbbjv	1	*	The ultimate appeal to authority argument for morality. 
t1_duga9fs	1	*	I'm Canadian maybe I should have mentioned that, but a lot of people here are shitting their pants over the US every day

t1_dt33h8l	0	*	What if I consume a different family from down the street?
t1_dsbmqci	0	*	That's why the preferred alternative is and should be the taboo [one-State solution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-state_solution). 
t1_dscc143	1	*	Depending slightly on what you call original land, got sure. I'm referring to 67 lines.
t1_dtd83n8	1	*	This says they aren't in the EU, just that they're still in talks.  Turkey isn't part of the EU today.
t1_dszjyeu	0	*	Yes, I do. I read Times of Israel, Haaretz, etc.
t1_dszplyi	0	*	Is there a word for this kind of tactic? Where you take the role of the person who gets to say whether someone else's view is legitimate, and only if they agree to talk in your terms?
t1_dszblhn	1	*	That would be Gaza, this is Betlehem, vastly diffrent areas.
t1_dv23nvc	1	*	Well, it's their career at that point. I guess the idea is don't abuse them, they're respected members of the community.
t1_dv1gzhn	1	*	So right whales are like the Cleveland Browns?   Got it. 
t1_dsv29nq	1	*	The people responding negatively to you are idiots. You are right.
t1_dsum72v	0	*	I don't know a single 11 year old who has held national pressers, makes upcomplex and detailed lies, and accuses nations of being racist. It's so obvious that the family was in on this whole thing.
t1_dsuys65	1	*	Oh of course, why should you accept responsibility for what YOU do?
t1_dsuwcge	0	*	Actually I'm not, because I'm not saying it 100% happened this or that way like you are. Key phrase: it's just as likely.  >you fucking con artist slime ball.  Jesus calm down
t1_dsuhzck	1	*	Your comment doesn't refute anything they said.  She may learn from it and be a better person but that doesn't change the fact that other people will judge for a very long time.
t1_dufbr5p	0	*	Africa and Russia? Is China going to give them rides to the SCS?
t1_dulwq98	1	*	Wish I would have been invited to those kinds of parties in college
t1_dubvwab	0	*	It's still a really different culture, and small. Beats polonium tea or getting killed walking down the street by a mugger, though.
t1_duc19bw	0	*	Have you actually left US once? Or all your knowledge is based on what you read online?   And it's hilarious how you sleep well after using Trump phrases and being lefty at the same time.
t1_dubmcob	0	*	I hang a black sheet over my bedroom window for that week. The midnight sun is cool and all but fuck anything that interferes with my sleep.

t1_ds4e0t9	1	*	Exacto. Just like those scientists who have no understanding of economics, saying gas will be used up by xxxx date
t1_dsklzs6	1	*	I live in America, my quality of life is great and my healthcare is affordable 
t1_dsknvsv	1	*	To people like you, the world is irrelevant, and yet somehow you see that as something to be proud of instead of the problem it is.

t1_dskml60	0	*	I hear the Norwegian Blue has lovely plumage. Maybe you can find you one while you're there. 
t1_dskrlkc	1	*	Then, immediately deny you said fake news, like the US ambassador to the Netherlands.
t1_dskvsnq	0	*	Have you been to the US before?
t1_dsklsyy	1	*	Yeah and they only did it because it was a direct quote from someone important that wouldn't have the same impact censored. 
t1_dskox9s	1	*	Nope. Even among the Americans who went out to vote, Trump didn't even get the most votes.  Our electoral system is quite flawed.
t1_dskjj6m	1	*	Nope. He only became strong anti-Trump after Trump tweeted about Mika. They went to Mar A Lago during his campaign.
t1_dskm37f	1	*	No.....he actually said that. 
t1_dskk66x	1	*	its like snow birds going to mexico when they retire.
t1_dskjdbd	0	*	Gotcha. I thought the person was stating actual facts and I was wondering where on earth they saw that figure.
t1_dsktxz7	1	*	He didn't win the majority of votes though
t1_dski9zi	1	*	So you think countries that need aid and supplies are lurking reddit to downvote you? You must be american lol. 
t1_dskptpt	0	*	You didn't make the distinction clearly at all, saying you made it clearly is a hilarious form of projection
t1_dsksboy	1	*	Well no, you see I actually have stepped foot into 5 African countries. And I'm complaining about Trumps statements.
t1_dskkc45	1	*	> His point is valid  No it's not. He doesn't have a point.

t1_dskkom3	0	*	Yeah going from ranked 1 to ranked 8 among 200+ countries is such a step down 
t1_dskppc8	1	*	The prospect of becoming richer from you insider trading and a get out of jail free card has to be tempting fruit.

t1_dskpm4f	1	*	This is the stupidest response to his comment. Nothing to do with what you said before. 
t1_dskrv5q	1	*	I already commented this. It's a decade old tradition to do this, but no one has picked as many blunders as Trump
t1_dskn9in	1	*	More like r/nothingeverhappens
t1_dsks9sq	1	*	Poor guy didn't realize that only Trump gets to immediately contradict himself, and reality, and get away with it.

t1_dumh44o	0	*	Nah, it just adds an extra layer of faxe7ade. 
t1_dumgncs	1	*	There's no opposition party. It isn't an election, it's a coronation. 
t1_dun0phm	1	*	Helping run a sham election won't advance democracy, it merely helps add a veneer to legitimacy to the ruling party.
t1_dsjn3j7	1	*	> whether we should welcome immigrants from all countries, not just from the first world?  As an immigrant.  The answer is NO!  
t1_dsjmo36	0	*	> Why are you trying to shift the conversation   Same question. What does Haiti being a shithole have to do with not allowing immigrants from there? Haiti is a shithole

t1_ds6y7fn	0	*	How is that spin? I'm not saying it's going to be good or bad, but it's going from Federal oversight to state oversight.   I now see he edited it to a different comment from before.

t1_dt1xgb9	1	*	[One of their most beloved rock stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor_Tsoi) was a korean. I don't think he would have attained this kind of popularity if they hated koreans.

t1_du3tlah	1	*	Gladly, we dun goofed.   #sendjaffacakes
t1_du3nzs1	0	*	i wasnt talking about plastic specifically. i was referring to general environmental impact.  plastic is a little thing in a humans life: energy, heat, water, food, soil, metals, fuel...
t1_du3olxu	0	*	...if you're going to stock up on plastic bags doesn't that eliminate their only purpose - convenience? At that point just buy a reusable grocery sack...the fuck?
t1_du3i6ur	1	*	My favorite are individually shrink wrapped organic produce. Yeah. Way to fuck that up, idiots who distribute food.
t1_dszhw5w	1	*	No problem, here is an old article that summarizes their plight: https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/09/rohingya-refugee-crisis-myanmar-burma-spd/  Have a nice day!

t1_dsenj67	0	*	Do you ever consider your username and angrily proclaim: I am not a mere number!?
t1_dulpdgq	0	*	So why should the workers, who are about to lose their jobs, continue to work for a company that is abandoning them rather than giving them a final fuck you?
t1_dsihl5k	1	*	I see people get annoyed, and eventually bringing there own. Not all people.
t1_dsgp6bl	0	*	Now I want to see an implementation of bottle and drink can deposit as they have elsewhere on the continent, this more or less guarantees that every bottle or can gets recycled. 
t1_dsh9f2e	0	*	pssst... everyone in Europe knows about Aldi. It started there way before it came to the US.
t1_dsgqd2l	1	*	Experience proves that people will not throw away bags they paid for. They should be 20p though, not 5.
t1_dsh2vxo	0	*	Why not just reuse the bags instead of recycling? 
t1_ds61zgo	1	*	very similar to my image haha.
t1_dv3clqx	1	*	This is so true and so many people just don't believe it.
t1_dtb6slo	1	*	That's like the opposite of what Trump did

t1_dtb2msd	0	*	>limited punishment   >Gulag  Pick one.

t1_dtazeuo	1	*	You think the offer is there for a second marriage? 
t1_dtaxju5	1	*	All of daddy's money and no plastic surgery. Harsh, Putin is truly a monster.
t1_dtb9njz	1	*	I just asked my Russian girlfriend about his two daughters and she says everyone in Moscow knows about them and who they are... even 20 years ago.
t1_dtb828s	1	*	Putin's won, hasn't he?
t1_dtbcj5m	0	*	Youd love to hate to be rich as long as youre okay, that is kind of all over the place lol
t1_dtb3vnh	1	*	Holy crap that's hilarious 
t1_dtaze8i	1	*	Maybe some other countries should meddle in the Putin family affairs... you know just some fake news articles or something. No big deal. 
t1_dtb0tlh	1	*	If I bought 2500000 women the pussy stock market would crash though. And this guy isn't paying for pussy he's paying for not having it which is my point. 
t1_dtb85h8	1	*	This is probably what replaces baseball in the summer Olympics. Much broader appeal 
t1_dtb5my7	1	*	Right. If I were him and wanted to dump her, I'd deliberately start acting less and less likeable so that she would dump me instead.
t1_dtb0w9z	1	*	Haha, best comment!
t1_dtb122n	0	*	Is Russia still living in the 80's? 90's came with no more Soviet Union, so they just said fuck it then we will never move past the 80's!

t1_dtb6j07	1	*	Honestly what Russian doesn't. 
t1_dtc09rw	1	*	Haha, you funny! I send you to gulag last!
t1_dtb3qnh	1	*	And then falls asleep while watching one of the episodes together only to make you re-watch it with her once she wakes up.
t1_dtay4zg	1	*	Not one side or half of each, every other hair.  Plucked by Stalin's original nose-hair tweezers.
t1_dtawwnc	1	*	She's cute.

t1_dtazjao	1	*	V-Putty
t1_dtbl1yk	1	*	I guess from a strategic/political standpoint, that is pretty smart. Kids are a reputational risk when you're that high-profile. Bristol Palin comes to mind. 
t1_dtb012e	1	*	Sounds like Smiley's People from John Lewis Carre
t1_dtaxiug	1	*	Russian troll for real
t1_dtbf4uq	1	*	*escxe1ndalo*

t1_dtalbpl	0	*	11
t1_dtb64tp	1	*	Vlad Daddy
t1_dtbr9dq	1	*	Definitely not, boogie woogie is a completely different dance style. But the event was probably a collective xabrocknroll dance styles world master competitionxbb, which includes her style. 
t1_dtazkye	1	*	Holy shit what if she is. Like, what if Vlad gets really tired of being a dictator sometimes and just wants to hit the club and have some fun. 
t1_dtb1jvo	1	*	YIKES!!!
t1_dtax3a8	1	*	She looks like a woman to me. If that were the case my family would all look trans. But it's just simple genetics. I do see the resemblance though.
t1_dtay0qu	0	*	Anyone with enough power to challenge or threaten him would know their identity regardless. 
t1_dsf0gdx	1	*	By stopping them from supplying Hezbollah.   It's right there in the article.
t1_dsw5l9o	1	*	You serious on the marijuana? Last I checked, it is opioids that are killing hundreds of thousands of people every year
t1_dsvcuur	1	*	If you don't let them do this money trick,  they will simply move their company away, and then your country has no business,  no job and no money. Thanks globalism. 
t1_dsv0pr4	1	*	Great argument! Wait what?
t1_dsv2fl2	0	*	You really dont understand what citation means do you?
t1_dsvifx7	0	*	Depends on where you're going.  I could do fast food, but I'm kind of in the mood for something more.
t1_dtn77cd	1	*	I wonder why he didn't? Oh wait, I'm not a complete fucking idiot.
t1_dt5q2or	1	*	But with actual power *shudders*.
t1_dt5pkvy	1	*	God is actually occasionally represented, but its rare, not because of specific rules but because god is supposed to be non physical and non human.   (Im not sure how this applies to no catholics)

t1_du1om3i	1	*	Of course, everyone is, gay or not gay. Glorious leader FTW
t1_dtlaujp	1	*	All parliamentary systems where the PM is selected by representative membership have the same issue. The US is if anything more directly tied to the popular vote. 
t1_dtleo63	1	*	I understand that, and America wasn't too democratic at the time, if we want to look at things from an objective view. That's why the 13-15th Amendments had to be passed later. 
t1_dtw3g56	0	*	Yes, the stay behinds were all part of the same NATO operation

t1_dtl2wwg	1	*	> It's so stupid that it's kinda funny.  yup, kinda like the US spending all its money on war, and nothing on infrastructure or healthcare.  Pretty soon we are going to implode and cause WW3.

t1_du2jroq	1	*	No. It's a drizzle. Barely registers in the water-table.
t1_duucgco	0	*	In the U.S.A., a very large majority of children are addicted to social media. It is almost impossible for a parent to prevent it.
t1_dupibvq	1	*	Yeah, but the guy above me is using it stoke his hatred of Muslims. 
t1_du1u7fa	0	*	No, I would never go to Africa.

t1_dt863o7	0	*	Uh, there absolutely is. Theres thousands of them. 
t1_dt864xk	0	*	France gets the majority of its electricity from Nuclear power. Coal is very very minor in France.
t1_dt8wgl8	0	*	What show were you thinking of?
t1_dt82dwl	1	*	Worked for Trump.
t1_dt8mvyl	1	*	I'm obviously talking about the majority opinion in Germany, not the opinion of every single German. And it's a big majority in this case.
t1_dt8cage	0	*	New nuclear is more expensive than new wind and new solar is rapidly dropping in prices nuclear isnt. 
t1_dt850oy	1	*	Plus there's minimal jobs in manufacturing solar cells. 
t1_dt8ki1c	0	*	That's irrelevant in the context of pointing out how ignorant your comment is.
t1_dt8802g	1	*	I always say technology is basically just magic like we see in wizard/witch movies and stuff, we just don't think of it that way.
t1_dt8wmcx	1	*	Oh yeah, I forgot about that. if you wanted to make your product sound futuristic, chuck a 2000 on it. 
t1_dt80j94	0	*	Do research before making naive blanket statements like this.
t1_dt8w9p6	1	*	Also; are nazis bad, is universal healthcare good and so on.
t1_dt7uxc0	1	*	But it can be contained safely and sometimes even reprocessed.
t1_dt8ba8y	1	*	I think that's precisely why they are fucked. Climate becomes increasingly inhospitable plus famine, water shortages, etc.
t1_dt8cl62	0	*	Why would people go without electricity because of him shutting down coal plants?
t1_dt905z8	1	*	Oh man can I relate to that.

t1_dt88kq5	1	*	Donald Trump told me he they clean it really good, so it makes sense to me.... obligatory /s because I know you people.
t1_dt862j0	1	*	But don't they have gas too?
t1_dt8ok6a	1	*	I'm 57 and growing up in the 60s I could not have imagined many of the things I take for granted today, including the laptop from which I typed this and the internet through which I posted it.
t1_dt82tbw	1	*	Nuclear produces 36% of the total energy consumption in France (electricity is 47%, from which 77% is produced by nuke). It makes it the first energy source before oil (29%)
t1_dt7yd3v	0	*	Couldn't they just have the panels pivot (which I thought they already do in some farms)? Have panel pivot to 90 degrees, sand fall off, panel goes back, bing-bang-boom. Where's my Nobel?
t1_dt8336x	0	*	Ignoring all the sickness, ignoring all the liquidators in Ukraine since there was never an official, independent investigation... basically let's ignore all the facts and yes, then you're right.
t1_dt7xr8m	1	*	You're correct.  I should say that nuclear power *today* is the largest source of electricity in France.  Solar and wind are making a lot of headway but that is largely market driven.
t1_dt98kvs	0	*	While nuclear accidents can be dramatic, [nuclear is the safest energy source.](https://www.nextbigfuture.com/2011/03/deaths-per-twh-by-energy-source.html)

t1_dt84d1w	1	*	Also if politicians weren't regularly bought out by fossil fuel companies explicitly for the purpose of denying ease of access to renewables.
t1_dt82u76	1	*	Neither are reliable power sources to provide a baseline and storage is not where we could save peak production for where theres not enough.
t1_dt833li	1	*	That's just how the world works sometimes. We won't need coal plant workers for the same reason we don't have asbestos manufacturers, because it's obsolete and harmful.   
t1_dtasg5l	1	*	Sounds like a solid investment. If I attempt to cash in my currency, it can be stolen anytime! Exactly what you want. 
t1_dtbuwgb	1	*	When this joke was first used, Bitcoin was in the obscurity so any PR is good PR. However anti-bitcoin people are too bitter to acknowledge it. 
t1_dta8net	1	*	Every time lol
t1_dtbutvo	1	*	In reality, when this joke was used, Bitcoin was in the obscurity so any PR is good PR. However anti-bitcoin people are too bitter to accept it and forcefeed  that joke to make fun of bitcoin 
t1_dtb4vfz	0	*	Unfortunately I don't think stealing Bitcoins is illegal either. It's digital assets with value but no definite legal protection; it could be viewed like stealing game gold in Warcraft.
t1_dtaqzuc	1	*	Which is good for Bitcoin
t1_dtb2gdu	1	*	It doesn't make it legal, it just means that nobody cares.
t1_dtau2ih	1	*	I remember when I could have bought 1000btc for 80 bucks and.................. (dies a little inside)

t1_dspx8yt	1	*	If you think the dumb joke would hit harder if you converted to joules, be my guest. 
t1_dsr6899	1	*	In certain countries they have (artificial) lakes on an elevated position. They use the excess energy to pump to water upwards and use it later for hydroelectricity 
t1_dsps7hh	0	*	If a device like that did exist, it would probably cost more to operate than they pay to get rid of extra electricity from the grid.
t1_dspiw5m	1	*	Someone will explain this better  Intentionally: Load reduction in voltage Unintentionally: Demand outstrips supply 
t1_dspjf9n	0	*	Christ I had to walk away and check if I was having a stroke.  ... no offense intended if this is your second language.
t1_dtdq5qa	1	*	Homeless just means they don't have a permanent home. Rough sleeper means they don't have a roof over their heads. There is a difference, not just some pretend PCness that you seem to look for!
t1_dtdn3t8	1	*	More of their regional expression for it.
t1_dtekq4a	1	*	If it means saving the NHS and not playing the post code lottery for proper mental health services then so be it, I think voting on policy instead of popularity will be the way forward. 
t1_dtdqurc	0	*	As big as anywhere else but in any country the gov can definitely just buy out your stuff   Or it would be impossible to build roads or anything that spans large areas wouldnt it? 
t1_dte7yj5	1	*	It breaks election funding rules set out by the electoral commission 
t1_dunl5ti	0	*	They do marry goats, but only if forced to:  http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4748292.stm
t1_duncz5h	1	*	Exactly. Goats never know how it is with the arranged marriages
t1_dtgihhx	1	*	Japanese are also capable of being homeless you know. It didn't say foreigners.
t1_ds1alh8	0	*	Content that preaches violence to innocent human beings, usually religious content. It really isn't that hard to define.
t1_du6u3pf	0	*	The only part that you were corrected on, would be the residential area not being a gun free zone. There are gun free zones in Chicago.

t1_dsz5a5v	0	*	Wow at Oman at number 8.

t1_dszwjfz	0	*	Congratulations on saying nothing to refute that statement. Sorry your sides hurt pussy
t1_dsyz4in	0	*	Hey great source from 2010 there.
t1_dsz9l1i	1	*	Quality of care vs expense of care, if I'm understanding correctly. 
t1_dsyzp8d	0	*	Right, let's focus entirely on the negative past and ignore the progress. That's a good way to encourage improvement. 
t1_dsyyl43	0	*	Americans pay higher taxes towards public health than literally 99.8% of the world, even after adjusting for purchase power parity.   They literally don't want to save money to cover everybody.
t1_dsz6wd7	1	*	True, but it's expensive AND not that great compared to other countries overall.
t1_dt0ion3	0	*	I don't know how you can live through winter without a decent amount of snow. What's the point?
t1_dsz2k4r	1	*	The US is 37th on the same list.
t1_dsz242k	0	*	Fair enough then, though you should have made that clear in your original post.
t1_dszuezz	0	*	hmm....is there one thing we spend more on than pretty much the rest of the world put together (nearly)?
t1_dsyzq95	1	*	why do they always say that?   i wish i could treat it as cash, motherfuckers!
t1_dszk7bk	0	*	Im not rich and my health care is sufficient. Ive worked hard to get a career that would ensure healthcare for my family and I. With the opportunity given to any American. 
t1_dszcaqi	1	*	The title is not misleading at all. It's is completely accurate in that Egypt passed a universal healthcare law. Your personal interpretation of what that means doesn't make it misleading. 
t1_dsz4q40	0	*	Doesn't something like 85% of the population live in a hundred mile strip along the US border? so its still pretty spread out (maybe still more than US) but not THAT spread out.
t1_dszmgy2	0	*	Universal healthcare isn't Socialism, it's adorable you've been brainwashed to think this though.
t1_dszksmq	0	*	And if you can't afford it? That's just a case of tough shit you deserve to die?
t1_dsz0vpm	0	*	I'm Canadian too. lol. you're misreading my comments

t1_dsyym9k	0	*	Dental is separate from healthcare, tho
t1_dsz5vjm	0	*	> I live close to the border and many people come to America for surgeries and treatments.  No they don't. There's statistics for this. It's a very tiny minority. 
t1_dsz5qi8	1	*	ya, but their ranking is going to improve now.  Americas isn't.
t1_dsz8o02	1	*	But...  It wasn't present, since it covered only 50% of the population..
t1_dszgcu4	1	*	/r/ListsWithoutNewZealand
t1_dsz9s32	0	*	Oh so north Korea and etc are all good now? Because they are criticised  far more, so we must be wrong.
t1_dsywje8	0	*	Because it's mostly Americans on Reddit. Americans for whom American problems are in the forefront of their thought processes.  Hence, why you perceive there is so much American bashing going around.
t1_dszsy13	1	*	To pay for the medicare for all plan Bernie Sanders proposes, income taxes would need to be raised across all income brackets. Do you find this difficult to understand?
t1_dsz7hnm	1	*	Look at it this way: Pay shitty salaries, with shitty rights, get shitty teachers.
t1_dszcoqf	0	*	Told to go die that's some grade A bullshit right there. The ER legally cannot refuse to treat you if you have an emergency. Yes, it will cost a lot, but they're not going to tell you to go die. 
t1_dsz5o9z	1	*	> Racism doesnt exist here. At all.  I don't think there's any country you can really say that in.
t1_dszhlpf	1	*	Every international student is at least offered it. 
t1_dszjsm9	1	*	I studied law; dropped out to do music tours. At the very least I spent 40k to learn how to argue which is surprisingly useful on these tours.
t1_dsywm0n	1	*	No one from the UK or Canada says things like this. This is ridiculous propaganda you've been fed to make you content with the appalling state of US healthcare
t1_dszjqsm	1	*	I kept yanking on my bootstraps but they just cut off the circulation and now I can't afford the amputation :(
t1_dsz3gkf	0	*	The discussion is about coverage and insurance. Abortion is less a Healthcare issue than it is a beliefs issue. 
t1_dsz5grt	1	*	> And now those people have access to healthcare where they didn't before.  They're literally getting access to a couple Tylenol and some rusty surgical tools.
t1_dszoile	1	*	You spelled facts wrong
t1_dsyzt0a	0	*	It contains a lot of shitholes though. Ever driven through northern Ohio? Gary Indiana? Mississippi? 
t1_dszb1ku	1	*	I'm glad that with my health insurance, preventative care is free like if you need a flu shot or need some blood tests, it's usually free.
t1_dsyzb62	1	*	Healthcare *system*, not healthcare.  Again, very different things. 
t1_dszpm9p	0	*	Reading all the other comments on here desensitised me, preventing me from telling sarcasm from reality.   My apologies.

t1_dsz1p39	0	*	hahahaha yea we all give a shit about the healthcare that reaches 6% of egyptians, give it a fucking break.
t1_dsz46r4	1	*	At public schools they are worth zeroU0001f917
t1_dsz0d4u	0	*	Yes but the small percent that are the same as us seem to do better than us in terms of healthcare and some times education.
t1_dt01vxw	0	*	Because they won't be doing it for profit. There's a reason an Asprin at a hospital costs $100.
t1_dszekv7	0	*	To be honest we are already living in a one world government. It just seems to the untrained eye like we have more choices and differences than we in fact do
t1_dsz6vrs	1	*	The main metric used to place them above the US in that study is public funding of health care, not availability of care.
t1_dugx5am	1	*	I'd say it's more a kind to falsely accusing someone of a crime. Even though no specific person was named, it's still reporting that a crime was committed that never occurred 
t1_du8cdye	0	*	probably not the best time to use that abbreviation. 
t1_dupwv7u	1	*	 They already got caught though
t1_duq4oey	0	*	It was honorable? For Soviet occupied and pillaged Eastern Europe there was nothing honorable about it.
t1_dupx10z	0	*	You called people in this thread naive for thinking it's only Russia who is doping. No one in this thread thinks it's only Russia who is doping. 
t1_duq9f6b	0	*	Didn't the US cycling team dope? ie. That Armstrong guy and his team?
t1_duq7o5u	1	*	>, clearly that bullshit ban didn't do jack shit  Oh it did. It hit the Russian pride, and that's all they care about.

t1_dupm28c	1	*	Yeah i also find it absurd to dope in curling and bobsledding. Especially since their tests were clean a week prior. Something is very sketchy about this situation. 
t1_duqdlrc	1	*	Any of the Russian individuals who failed a test were excluded from being a part of the OAR.  But apparently they missed a few. 
t1_dtr6vv6	1	*	I could see trump doing it.
t1_dts1efi	1	*	Taiwan is part of China. Even Taiwan says so, albeit they think the mainland belongs to them, so pick another country.

t1_dsrp6ap	1	*	Even as an outside observer it seems to be that the conservative agenda simply isn't working. Penny wise and pound foolish seems rather appropriate.
t1_dsr1kaj	1	*	No, however it is clear that the decision was far from decisive in either direction. Re-evaluating that course when it can lead to such dire consequences isn't a crazy notion. 
t1_dsrsafn	1	*	Better to be inside the room influencing the decisions, than outside watching them being made.

t1_dt90h30	1	*	I quickly looked for a Trump translator to paste on to and found [this](https://clash.me/trump).  It's terrible, but interestingly the word 'freedom' is allocated to Martin Luther King Jr.

t1_dt944kv	0	*	You see nothing wrong with embarrassing another head of state into trying to repress freedom of assembly? There's security and then there's saying I want no protesting at all in my general vicinity.

t1_ducom22	0	*	And if you go through some of the posted tweets, the language is quite similar.

t1_dud08us	1	*	Lots of people burn one for Bernie too ;0
t1_ducynjo	1	*	Russia has a very long and impressive history of this kind of thing. No one in the world has ever done it as well as them.
t1_ducusd3	0	*	He said that was the case in this indictment and said the investigation is ongoing. This isn't the vindication for Trump that right wingers want to pretend it is.
t1_ducqsg2	0	*	> yet no evidence has been found or released.  The indictments of members of his administration beg to differ.
t1_ducmghj	1	*	I can find thousands of fake news stories the_donald and r/conspiracy has fell for in minutes.

t1_duqtupn	1	*	You are correct.
t1_duqtmvu	1	*	I am merely stating SCIENTIFIC FACTS. You can make inferences and extrapolate your own conclusions.
t1_dsk8nb2	1	*	This. The leftist bias in media is factual. No, trickle down economics dont work. Yes, global warming is real. No, vaccines dont cause autism. 
t1_dskislf	1	*	The media is biased. There is no such thing as free media in the us l
t1_ds200jh	1	*	He i just a 14yo teenager. Don't speead lies.

t1_dt0h8wj	1	*	Well yes, but the US has not just confirmed a new trade deal.  Said trade deal was confirmed in May 2017

t1_dtocgu7	1	*	You dont take 5 seconds when there could potentially be a nuclear bomb heading for your country-_-

t1_dto2vqc	1	*	Which word. There are seven of them.
t1_dto1eoo	0	*	There is no such thing as over sensitive tornado sirens.  They don't automatically go off when the wind picks up.
t1_dtoes23	1	*	Is it wrong of me to expect everyone who graduated high school to know that word (well, all of them, really) regardless of skin tone?
t1_duactz2	0	*	I think we have like 10 ways of using eh I believe he is correct.
t1_dsax3qt	1	*	I had read this from a repost on r/Christianity. Sorry for the confusion. I deleted my previous comment and will reword it.

t1_dupf4uo	1	*	Money and over population are the real problems. 
t1_dupyt0b	1	*	They do just sell you the cheese you just have to be willing to pay the premium for the good stuff and several people aren't  
t1_duq16s0	1	*	Fair enough. At least you're not claiming banning it would somehow magically save the rainforests.
t1_dupjaoj	1	*	And they have the means to. They have some of the lowest birth rates around the world out of their developed status being in the third stage of becoming economically advanced as a country.

t1_dtixhu3	1	*	No one said they are smart.
t1_dtiyvyw	1	*	Thanks U0001f609
t1_dtjdc8q	1	*	Multiple people in room. Firing while starting the process of cleaning a gun, which is when I assume these all happen, would still colloquially be considered as the gun going off while cleaning it.

t1_duy8d4o	0	*	Annexation of Crimea was in 2014 IIRC. Do you think 70 years from now, people will think of it as the Sudetenland pt2?
t1_duy87bz	1	*	Gotta love that casual racism! 
t1_duy8nsw	1	*	lol, I like where your head's at. Poison them with chemicals disguised as food.

t1_dtm41yo	0	*	Do not post sexism.

t1_dusebz9	0	*	What organization is they?
t1_dur8ifw	1	*	I think you killed him.
t1_duryjaj	0	*	23 million always comes off as a made up figure. Oh yea, John Oliver's current estimates >< Uranium One is a drop in the bucket. Bucket in a swamp. 
t1_dur7q62	0	*	Alcohol kills more people than guns. Work on getting alcohol banned then move onto guns. 
t1_duroo5a	1	*	Not really. Gucci is announcing this and isnt breaking campaign finance laws to do so. 
t1_dur99ng	0	*	**anonymous individuals found to be discussing guns and political action in online chat forums, police currently do not know their identities** 
t1_dur827c	1	*	Cant make that kind of shit up? Haha ... Didnt you see what happened after 9/11?

t1_dsdgq6i	0	*	I suggest buying a shirt that says Show me your nunnies.
t1_dsbtszf	0	*	Neat. Now scientists need to show us what Hercules looked like. 
t1_dsc8jje	0	*	I wasn't, I was actually making a [Supply Side Jesus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cE0_JhLsgPQ) reference.  [Franken Version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gc-LJ_3VbUA)
t1_dsd93av	1	*	> Well, when he's older you'll regret it.  I'd still ask why just to see if they had the nerve to say he'll turn out a wanker if he was uncut.
t1_dsbzjb4	1	*	Dude. Hot dogs are a no no for small kids. Choking hazard.
t1_dsc5wr3	1	*	Would they have flipped a tit?
t1_dscx7z2	1	*	That's incredible.  And don't feel bad, I *have* seen Little Nicky (albeit once, when it was in the theatres) and I still went to Paul Revere.
t1_dscnwq6	1	*	I hope he's aware of this:  https://youtu.be/qvSOgB-JPy0?t=86 
t1_dsca7ez	1	*	> God is much greater than a couple of titties.   I don't know about that, I've seen some amazing titties in my time.   
t1_dsc9htz	1	*	Lol ya'll are so silly thinking God would prefer you wear the longer pants, made by child slaves, than the short pants that are also made by child slaves.
t1_dsbth0h	1	*	This definitely depends on the church.  I wasnt raised Catholic, but rather one of the large Protestant denominations, and men usually wear suits to church, sometimes just a blazer in the summer. 
t1_dslnch5	0	*	That sounds pretty insulting... 
t1_dslefs5	0	*	Yes.
t1_dsw0y5w	1	*	Our soft power is rapidly declining...
t1_dsvqf21	0	*	And kicked off the biggest domestic spying issue to ever plague this country.

t1_ds9fie0	0	*	Yet they passed through Sudan and Egypt to get to a wealthy country.
t1_ds2196o	1	*	That paper never predicts the greening of the Sahara. It only addresses what MIGHT happen with regard to cyclone formation IF IT DID become greener. 
t1_ds236wk	1	*	That says it *could* become greener. So far, it has only become dryer.
t1_du8wwhm	1	*	Are you from 1950 or just a fan of neonazi rheotoric?
t1_dtindvc	0	*	Nah, as a citizen of the strongest NATO country I am telling you our governments are going to kiss Turkey's ass until there is nothing good left in Turkey
t1_dshnjls	1	*	If Jamaica can have a bob-sleigh team....

t1_duqmswl	0	*	Don't shoot your eye out. 
t1_duna85q	0	*	It would be like buying a floor model couch or stereo from a retail store.  You have a right to know the products history.  Especially when it's so much money.
t1_dtcwwbp	1	*	You're welcome 
t1_dsnc7uh	0	*	I know it.
t1_duse0su	0	*	Only thing they were on was beer and red meat
t1_dut2spu	0	*	Wait, but...doesn't drinking make it  *harder*  for you? Why would they disqualify you for taking a substance that effectively gives you a handicap?  
t1_duqetb5	1	*	If North Korea go to war soon, I blame /u/__Hello_my_name_is__
t1_dsvtrdk	0	*	The drone feed includes the location, and the pilot takes off from an airstrip. Everything you just said is idiotic and shows you don't know what you're talking about
t1_dsx1btw	0	*	Nothing in recent history has been even remotely bad enough to cause an armed uprising.
t1_dsvxj43	0	*	People say that but what do you mean by that?
t1_dswk060	1	*	I'd call the police on you
t1_dsw4h87	1	*	......and to accept a police state as normal and peaceful.
t1_dsvrrp3	1	*	Nah, they just want to hug their guns reeeeeally tight while eying the neighbor menacingly because of his heightened melanine levels in peace
t1_dswrvk6	0	*	doesn't citizens united overrule this and make it legal?
t1_dswr54z	1	*	Can you tell me which gun has the majority of murders in the United States without looking?
t1_dsw772s	1	*	And you know he pulled the gun too but they just don't want to lose their black narrative.
t1_dsvw43a	1	*	That was decades ago. Did they even weigh in on Rock River and Springfield?
t1_dsxem4k	1	*	Stop making it sound like Jordan Peterson has anything to do with the alt-right. He hates extremism on both sides.

t1_dsfk7c5	1	*	Actually no, that's normal wording in the space industry.  
t1_du839u9	0	*	It only took you half a minute to burn France to the ground, so Im guessing its easy.
t1_du8wj2g	0	*	Not all countries are like yours. Learning comradery and discipline without brainwashing and propaganda is actually extremely common in many countries. We're not all US, China or Russia.
t1_du7quik	1	*	Why? Women can fight as well there are literally no reasons they cannot. You shouldn't have to die for a country that abandoned you
t1_du8d1ij	1	*	They still have to do it at some point. Have foreign exchange friends.

t1_dt3cysd	1	*	try google

t1_dsnpwjg	1	*	The USA gun culture is how I knew from the title alone it was in the UK, the description of the tackle and headlock. Rare here
t1_dsm7i5y	0	*	That may happen since IPCC have said they should face disciplinary action
t1_dslkelp	1	*	Why would that be right wing propaganda..? If anything they would be the racists. Just look at the pre- and post-Brexit rhetoric.

t1_dsljl42	1	*	Did you not pay attention to *any* of the rhetoric around brexit? There was a shit ton of racism. Also how is that right wing propaganda in the least bit? That doesnt make any sense. 
t1_dsx6ntp	1	*	They're just passing through to a civilized country. I don't think anyone wants to stay in a shithole. 
t1_duad66k	1	*	The corporations that benefited from the invasion didn't do it by keeping Iraqi resources, they did it by bleeding the US taxpayer. It's a much more reliable source of income.
t1_dub9rtx	1	*	yea that happened right in that ballpark
t1_duanex7	1	*	/s was probably omitted
t1_dubeoq2	1	*	What was the lesson there? Don't overthrow a government via coup detat? Don't fight against the mujahideen? I'm not seeing how that's particularly relevant in Syria.
t1_dub63yy	1	*	Not me, Bud.  I hate this forever war powered by greed.  
t1_duae04q	0	*	It's not helpful but it's better than a raging civil war.
t1_dub8kxp	1	*	That's because they are only focused on the U.S. Putin has tunnel vision hard on for the U.S. and it's going to be his undoing. 
t1_dubgjt3	0	*	I think that is different from a State acting with morals. It has to deal with the morals of it's citizens, but the State itself does not have any.
t1_duc0uso	1	*	I can see Turkey forcing the US military bases out of Turkey.  The US has overstepped by illegally setting up bases in Syria, supporting terrorists and bullying Turkey in the region.

t1_dti06bd	1	*	If altruism is intrinsic, why would anyone question and doubt his intentions? Question and doubt occur because altruistic behavior is unexpected.

t1_dth9hw4	1	*	We'll also get better at mass producing mustard seeds with less water consumption, making it more economically viable and better for the environment 
t1_dthyahd	1	*	and for good reason 
t1_dthbwc0	1	*	Partly, but it's more about rotating crops and letting the soil rest. Sustainable agriculture is nothing new, it's been done for a very long time.
t1_dubha6s	1	*	So cheap. And if you have a pressure cooker, dry beans cook in less than an hour.
t1_duaqj81	1	*	Can confirm. Am cancer, love college students

t1_dummav8	1	*	We don't live in 24 sadly so it wouldn't happen. Too risky from an international relations point of view and probably illegal.
t1_dunwxhk	1	*	You could make an argument that it drew resources away from fighting other armed groups such as M-23 which was growing while Kony was fading. M-23 later took control of large areas of Eastern DRC. 
t1_dumav5n	0	*	It's like you didn't read the previous two comments

t1_dtri832	0	*	And North Korea is the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. It's right there in the name!
t1_dtsqnpg	1	*	Hitler during the beer hall putsch attempted a coop against the Wiemar government. Now a days that would be considered terrorism, and Hiter was clearly a nationalist. 
t1_dtrgtd3	0	*	Was Anders Bering Breivik linked to a specific terrorist group? Because hes pretty universally considered a terrorist.
t1_dts1a57	0	*	I side with people because they are right, not because they are white. If the glove does not fit, then you must acquit.

t1_dtrrxs7	0	*	Or, maybe, she should've just stayed in rehab? 
t1_dtrmjr2	1	*	Italy is the home of the Mafia, remember. Dripping the charges as they find and prove them doesn't tend to get as big a reaction as slamming down 5-10 all at once.
t1_dtrq5dr	0	*	Im not saying nazism is a mental disorder, but most nazis tend to have them.
t1_dtsmexu	1	*	Alt right is an American phenomenon. He is an European far rightist. 
t1_dtrnzvx	1	*	That will happen, its just that there is a period of time before the prosecutor announces the charges. The charges that you hear right now are informations bounced around, nothing official yet.
t1_dts1jzm	0	*	No, according to liberals police have a problem with racism in their ranks.   Plenty of evidence to suggest that's the case.

t1_dti7alp	0	*	And this is the right kind of patching? 
t1_dti77z1	1	*	Makes sense if the grandparents will actually live with that family, but may want to restrict it to grandparents over a certain age or ones that can't take care of themselves.
t1_dsgveb5	0	*	Knowing pyramid schemes have a bad history in China, I'm surprised that Amway is still legal in China and China is Amway's biggest market.

t1_dsl5ezb	1	*	So it's China's turn to colonize Africa. Wew.
t1_ds56xaf	1	*	No, they were making commissions as well, and those were equal.  It was a base salary + commissions. The females base salary were all reduced slightly.

t1_dsj9rw1	0	*	It has to deal with people outside of the US too. If similar posts of Trump make it to the top of this sub then fairgame

t1_dtqvxmi	1	*	diary of a madman eh...
t1_dt7c2mi	0	*	And what do economists think about dumping? You don't sound like an a economist, you sound like an AP or first year  macro student at best.   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dumping_(pricing_policy)
t1_dsk4rmw	0	*	is English spoken much south of Switzerland?
t1_dsl4l9y	1	*	Uh, no. The point is they ARE that bad, which is why we shouldn't punish people for trying to get their families out of there. Solid job missing the point.
t1_dsjz1so	0	*	.....did you even read the quote?
t1_dsjw0z6	0	*	That sounds.. Fascist.

t1_dsju5gm	0	*	When/where was that? I think I missed it 
t1_dsk0q6n	1	*	Yeah. Norwegians are the whitest of the white. They've never lost a war on home soil, cos they just blend into the snow.

t1_dsk5lpf	1	*	Probably a Nigerian Prince.   Don't bash royalty! 
t1_dskrcbe	1	*	Then you're missing the point.  It wasn't like he just said hey look at these shitholes!   It was in the context of immigration, and that we shouldn't allow immigrants from poorer countries.
t1_dsjuowz	1	*	Inb4 worldwide white population to quality of life comparison gets posted
t1_dska2ho	1	*	Hold up, you mean the Washington post lies about stupid things? No way.... /s
t1_dsk19hc	0	*	He should pick the gigantic hot pink wall with confetti and cool cars and trains painted on it.

t1_dska3xg	1	*	I agree with your interlocutor. I'm going through  those comments and facepalm on reading every other of them. Such is the level of illusion and naivitxe9.

t1_dsk1tgb	1	*	He gives a fuck about himself, does that count?
t1_dsk8e3s	0	*	Usually racism involves insulting other races, not countries. Not sure if you knew that.
t1_dsjtadi	1	*	That's referring to legal immigration, I was specifically referring to those who come into the country illegally, although I can see where my comment might cause confusion.
t1_dsk4sh9	0	*	I guess prejudice is alive in your industry also. What do you do? I'd like to avoid working with bigots if possible.

t1_dsjx0rk	1	*	That wasn't us, that was the WSJ. 
t1_dsjzsrd	1	*	Why do you assume Trump hates the people of those countries. Immigrants from those places know that they are shithole places. Why do you think theyre immigrants?
t1_dsk81az	1	*	He also spoke about asian countries.
t1_dsl2ux6	1	*	Me too.
t1_dskgfls	1	*	That is irrelevant given that most Americans can't even point out where on the map Norway is. That stat is a hilariously bad false equivalence.
t1_dsjy4m7	1	*	But /r/conspiracy is a pro-Trump sub...
t1_dsjwe2f	0	*	And, per that link, they murder people much more often.  Not sure why we should base immigration policy solely on words written on a French gift.
t1_dsjwkyk	1	*	which sounds like asshole, and thats what you look like when you use that goofy baby language on a national news network.
t1_dsmgjdz	0	*	On what basis are you generalizing that people from those countries dont have useful skills?
t1_dsk4at4	0	*	I think this presidency is a striking counterpoint to that philosophy. 
t1_dsjxv3d	1	*	No it's just the media adapting (or trying to) to a changing medium.
t1_dsklh24	1	*	> Why did the official brandings of today become less tolerant even thoigh the overall populace is more tolerant?  Because you're projecting your own tolerance on everyone else. I'm quite intolerant.

t1_dskfvfe	1	*	In 2017 a total of 2 people were shot and killed by firearms in Norway.  There were 24 people killed in other ways. All murder cases were solved.  The Police killed no one.   That's a normal year.
t1_dsjuof8	1	*	Hilarious how uninformed everyone in this thread is. Devolving into a us vs. them argument. The very thing half the people here are bitching about Trump doing. Just lol.

t1_dt1hkn3	0	*	They're actually pretty dope. They just don't invest much on drones, missles and airforce because there's just no need, but special forces, marines and such are all really dope.
t1_dt265h9	1	*	Its not vigilante if its military endorsed killing though. 
t1_dtdr5ka	1	*	Indeed, which many people colloquially shorten to marinos, which is, if I'm not mistaken, the direct translation of marines.
t1_dt1p5v3	1	*	No because they were acting on behalf of the authority. Not vigilante at all.

t1_dt1q89d	0	*	The Mexican Marines are usually the ones you can trust, no?   Maybe the cartels finally got to them.

t1_dt1td8e	1	*	Tks tsk simpleton. The answer is easy. Just be the next scarface.
t1_dt291l8	1	*	Being killed in Mexico is a pretty effective deterrent for people who have not yet been killed in Mexico to never visit. It's been eleven years since I stopped going there. 
t1_dt1tjw3	1	*	In certain places.  As in: the places where there were already fences.
t1_dt2got1	0	*	We can't change shit there.  We can change it here, though.
t1_dt1qgnk	0	*	The toll roads are just fine though. If Mexico destroys them to prevent invasion that is another story. Some of the free roads are shit.

t1_dst84e7	1	*	Unfortunately millions of people learned that fact :(
t1_dsupt6a	1	*	Its more based on how comfortable you are, like 0 is pretty damn uncomfortable. -89 is straight wildlings status.

t1_dtkhw0d	1	*	depends what you call a tourist attraction. I think what you are referring to attracts many tourists. 
t1_dtkefhw	1	*	No, it's for the beautiful nature, the bustling culture, the amazing food and the warm people.
t1_dszu8x2	1	*	Omg , common sense.
t1_dt04os5	1	*	A hijab doesn't get in the way though. It's just a scarf that covers your hair up. Obviously nobody's going to approve burkas.
t1_dszgrke	0	*	And when that happens then we can explain why hijabs and burkhas are different.
t1_dt0d9ce	1	*	We are what we are, and we're doing the best we can. It is not for you to set the standards by which we should be judged!
t1_duxg5ox	0	*	They wouldn't be able to get visas to get to you.

t1_ds6k1bn	0	*	>Deny what proof you have and ask for more proof, nice game youre trying to play.  This is what Pakistan does, not India. 
t1_dueb4sc	1	*	Close! Alliteration in name-calling is key, because Trump is speaking to a base that never grew out of elementary school bullying. Try Messy Mueller.
t1_duebaer	0	*	politics is astroturfed to hell and back.
t1_duec4l1	1	*	I thought you were disagreeing with someone for a second. It took reading a bunch of responses about Nah/Nha Trang to figure out that you weren't talking about a city named Trang. 
t1_duexsqz	0	*	Im sure some would argue they feel respect for and informed by the National Enquirer or News of the World or RT.

t1_duf1b0j	1	*	Yeah, it'd certainly suck to not be able to go to Europe, in particular. I don't think it's nearly as big a deal as many people are making it out to be, however.
t1_due5jra	1	*	Nice try, I'm on 11.3
t1_due6neb	1	*	I think it depends on the country where the visa is issued.

t1_duejpds	1	*	We talked for two hours, he wasn't bragging...perhaps you should go back to Fox and Friends
t1_due5ebx	1	*	It will cost around $100K for a new identity in Central-America. Aruba got outed for selling passports with birth certificates, registrations in order for 80K. This sort of stuff really happens.

t1_duenwj5	1	*	Only the patriotic part of it. 
t1_dueiuqi	1	*	But they will go quiet when the bots and shills providing them with traffic stop. Then it'll just be disturbed Americans left. 
t1_duebgw8	1	*	It's impossible for bots to be pro-Russia on one subreddit but against Russia in *this* subreddit!
t1_dueelve	1	*	Isn't this what the move The Terminal was about? The guy's country goes to war while hes in the airport and he can't enter or leave the US. Airports seem to be a neutral zone for politics

t1_dsmkb4l	1	*	Simply not true. Other wise vegans would drop dead. 
t1_dsmj3k5	0	*	Welfare groups promte the idea that its ok to exploit and kill animals do long as its done humanely. Welfarism does not help animals. Only veganism and abolitionism helps animals exploited by humans.

t1_duyc90a	1	*	Most western harbors ban ships that use high sulfur fuels. So effectively the same measure is a thing for ships.

t1_dubxpit	1	*	I don't know about slf, I'm pretty sure that's wrong; sodium-palmate is made from palm oil however and is extremely common. It's basically just a soap base, water, sodium hydroxide, and palm oil.

t1_dublho5	1	*	Thats why I stopped using deodorant years ago.

t1_dt098pz	1	*	What happened?
t1_dt0kkqv	1	*	I thought we were talking about socialism, why is it communist now?
t1_dt0fmoo	1	*	You can have social programs without it being socialism. And I think you know that.
t1_dt11ohf	0	*	This is also the real point behind welfare. It's not because we give a shit about poor kids, it's because we give a shit about poor kid's parents doing what is required to feed those little mouths.
t1_dt156lr	1	*	correct, good working socialism canxb4t be far away. The death of millions and multiple abysmal failures can only be considered honest tries. Itxb4s just around the corner.

t1_dt0m5mi	1	*	Socialism leads to communism, by design. 
t1_dt0uxoo	1	*	Enlightened self-interest only works in the case of universal omniscience.  Even then it discounts people who would be perfectly happy to inconvenience themselves as long as it hurt others.
t1_dt0l4ut	1	*	Oh man are you serious?  Also how the hell am I even remotely using Nazi propaganda?  Look at my post history I am staunchly against anything German.

t1_dt0ujql	0	*	That is horrifying, man. I'm sorry your family is stuck in this shit mess.
t1_dt064w8	1	*	I'd say China is like any other Communist country. They're actually state ran capitalist. 
t1_dt0tlx1	0	*	So the solution is to enact an economic policy that puts everyone down to the bottom, except for some family members of the party members?
t1_dt0hjlf	1	*	None of those things are socialist.  It wasn't schools, fire departments, or healthcare that destroyed Venezuela's economy.  It was full-on government take-over of industries.

t1_dskfubf	1	*	But why would the Russians want an inexperienced buffoon as U.S. President???  
t1_dskex1l	1	*	If anything it's an example that shrewd dictator Putin outwitted Trump and used him to weaken the US.
t1_dsk0n5f	1	*	Trump has both power and the ability to do something stupid.  A far scarier situation. 
t1_dsm25ch	1	*	Putin would be happy with a nuclear war on his doorstep that destroys his 2 biggest rivals.
t1_dskczxp	1	*	That chain will end up pretty fast with NK becoming a smoldering ruin, with no significant damage to other countries.  Nuclear fallout might be a problem, though.
t1_dsk7mcr	1	*	We didn't have nukes back then. 
t1_dsklld1	1	*	Feels like a Royal Rumble match

t1_dsf1nin	1	*	Wow, you'd think Australia would be the first to ban this and try to raise worldwide awareness. Sad
t1_dsf6ren	1	*	It seems that they must care a little bit, considering other countries have imposed similar bans on these products. 
t1_dsfhs2d	0	*	Can you recommend a chemical exfoliant? 
t1_dsez739	1	*	It was an incredibly bad idea, as people would get the tiny beads stuck in their gums. 
t1_dseyy7e	1	*	Lush uses all natural exfoliants like almonds, oats, sugar, and salt!
t1_dsf6u5q	1	*	Some of them are jojoba beads. Look the same, function the same, are a natural wax with none of the downsides of plastic. 
t1_dsex07p	1	*	And because of liability... the law suits were coming if they knew of the issue and kept selling the shit anyway.
t1_dsey1j9	1	*	Y'all are doing it wrong.  Lava soap is the only choice. Wash your skin with rocks. Super clean, and natural.
t1_dseynju	1	*	shhhhhh
t1_dsexw9p	1	*	Dead skin. But exfoliating with a washcloth is enough.
t1_dsex0qr	1	*	U can get em in the US still too. My grocery store has em. And Im not gonna lie, I tried biting some in the shower 
t1_dsezatv	1	*	Sugar works well too
t1_dsey6b6	1	*	It does to many people; grew up in a family like that.
t1_dsf6chm	0	*	Mica is like the 4th most common mineral in the earth's crust (Feldspars 51%, Quartz 12%, Pyroxene 11%, Mica 5%). It's normal for it to be around in pulverized bits.

t1_dsexs6p	1	*	[Look here.](http://www.beatthemicrobead.org/product-lists/) 
t1_dsewo4y	1	*	I prefer sugar scrubs as they're not as scratchy as salt can be for sensitive skin. 
t1_dsevy5l	0	*	Because they're a different species of animal and therefore their biology is different?  Same reason we can eat chocolate but it's poisonous to dogs.
t1_dsf9qi1	1	*	Your government isn't really doing that much about preserving oceans. 
t1_dsez4ho	0	*	What?
t1_dsff0bu	1	*	A treaty needs created and agreed upon. This is very bad for entire ocean food chain.
t1_dsew69s	1	*	Salt dissolves much faster. 
t1_dsfnw6s	0	*	Wow, thats really awesome. I didt know about that. Thats another good alternative and more reason to ban micro beads 
t1_dsew1xk	1	*	Fish dont brush their teeth. 
t1_dsfaz70	1	*	In my experience sugar is readily soluble in water, but I'm not familiar with any sugar scrubs.  Our hand cleaners are for industrial use so the microbeads were for tough dirt, not exfoliation.  
t1_dseyia4	1	*	Some Microbeads are actually made of oil and not plastic.
t1_dsez1ib	0	*	Yay we did it.
t1_dt9tf5y	0	*	Do you honestly trust the polls of a country that would gun down an opposition leader?

t1_dud5j04	0	*	Except they have zero meaningful jurisdiction where these people are. Also, the biggest charge I have seen is identity theft.
t1_dudh6n1	0	*	Don't try reason, Trump supporters only double-down on cognitive dissonance.
t1_dudioz5	1	*	Uh, he asked on live TV for russia to get Hillary's emails illegally.  I don't think there's much doubt here.
t1_dud3j0k	1	*	It was just playful banter, but so many people are so sensitive. I get a chuckle when people insult me. Some are funny, but most are lame, tired insults that I've heard countless times. 
t1_dud7i42	1	*	Surely you are not really that stupid, right?
t1_dudetwx	0	*	There's been a few stories about it over the last year. [Here](https://www.politico.com/story/2018/01/23/mitch-mcconnell-russia-obama-joe-biden-359531) is a more recent one about Biden discussing it.

t1_dud2o45	1	*	So were you forced to read it? 
t1_ducx28o	1	*	I do the same when I hear the word sheeple.
t1_dudgyd0	1	*	His refusal to enact the sanctions tells you everything ... that the EU isn't enacting sanctions so theres no point since that's where Russia gets a lot of its money.
t1_dud391s	0	*	Their interests tend to clash with everyone else's interests. They should try being interested in democracy and not invading their neighbors. 
t1_ducsdzq	0	*	It won't, they're already traitors and they won't waver.
t1_dud206d	1	*	I mean it is.  But that statement sure is a whole lot better than it's not happening and if it is it's no big deal and if it were it wouldn't be illegal.  
t1_dudac6l	1	*	It's all the small things you see that can really influence you over time, though.

t1_dud6mgo	0	*	How is the indictment bullshit? 
t1_dud3bsc	1	*	Stacyredneck though, she's a good christian
t1_ducy485	0	*	Political Theater, that's why he did it. 
t1_dudl7ve	1	*	They get called out. Then the downvotes from the gullible and bots bury the calls to the bottom... Which then solidifies the gullible's opinion.
t1_dud42tg	0	*	You implied you wish that was the case. Since theres no evidence of that, youre disappointed.
t1_ducream	1	*	After the election, not before. 
t1_dudgrd2	0	*	Yup, his son knowingly with someone who had ties with the Russian government to get information from them that would hurt Hillary. That's shady. Did Trump know and did he approve of it? 
t1_dudlk2i	1	*	..... wat
t1_dudrll7	1	*	Should my brain hurt when I read this? Reading this gave me a headache. I think maybe I'm just not smart enough to grasp what he's saying with my tiny brain.
t1_dudiixe	1	*	Yes
t1_dud49p0	0	*	He made it very clear that he was referring to this indictment and only this indictment with those comments
t1_dud2oyh	1	*	this is a good username.

t1_dudbrrq	0	*	Nor did Trump do any of those things.
t1_dudgvbs	1	*	Good thing good ol' Kerry let them in.

t1_dudkc5e	1	*	My bad :) 
t1_dud6spd	1	*	and lately there has been an increase in rhetoric toward those that say both sides are shit. What the fuck.
t1_dud6spm	1	*	I havent seen anyone mention that this was possibly in response to the nunes memo and the blocking of the dem memo.
t1_ducxvxu	0	*	You literally just repeated a talking point written in 2014.  Read the indictment.
t1_dudlff5	1	*	Every single thing you described is the act of an illegal alien voting in a US election.
t1_dud0qlr	1	*	Seems eager to interpret basic legal specificity as a negative pregnant
t1_dud3ale	1	*	And [Operation INFEKTION](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_INFEKTION)
t1_dudmyv2	1	*	Did you even read the indictment? They funded pro-Hillary things as well as pro-Trump and anti-Trump things. They funded anything and everything to polarize people.
t1_dud7ex1	1	*	Those pesky Russians are AMAZING though...somehow they got Trump elected but got Hillary the popular vote!   How did they do that???  (Theres no collusion)
t1_dud7ry7	1	*	Nice Buzzword.
t1_ducprt3	0	*	Who's **they** here?
t1_dudnebo	1	*	They also worked on Starbound.
t1_dudghuf	1	*	There would have been no indictment whatsoever if they had properly declared themselves and their purpose, as organizations like JIDF do.  Which is not very reassuring.

t1_dudb99t	1	*	It reduced the confidence in Hillary, and Russia may have thought Sanders could never win against Trump
t1_duct5oz	1	*	The quote is in the comments? 
t1_dud99rr	1	*	But but but.. Hillary! And emails! And uranium! 
t1_dud9loe	1	*	Sounds like they are charging Hillary.
t1_dud3xmu	0	*	You can be fluent in a language but still not have enough experience to sound like a native
t1_dudcfth	1	*	I think we can all agree that this absolutely vindicates Trump. 
t1_ductj64	1	*	The indictment doesn't clear anything. 
t1_dude221	1	*	Because we're innocent until proven guilty... unless you disagree politically.
t1_ducpht0	1	*	They also have their own international reporting infrastructure. Pretty much everyone else is using the AP news wire; which is essentially just these one sentence blurbs. 
t1_dud5aps	1	*	Also they arent saying they hate crime.  Its more like a brand like iPhone, iMac, and iMasterrace
t1_due49ri	1	*	Oh my god! You all are even more fucking adorable out in the wild!

t1_dt7oovp	1	*	Yes.

t1_dtb4pve	0	*	Almost like reflecting on the Third Reich and living through it he thought it best to avoid in the future. 
t1_dua7n55	0	*	Why do you think that though? We have pretty compelling examples in the rhetoric on North Korea and Iran. 
t1_du9f5hp	1	*	What are you even talking about? All those wars were started by Bush, a Republican. I'm sure Trump will catch up to five pretty quickly to keep his GOP handlers happy.

t1_duacl5z	0	*	It matters if you are selectively leaking information to influence the outcome of an election.
t1_duaniqy	1	*	Exactly. There is no resistance. There's this idea on the right that the left is in control of everything. But the truth is, the left has been stone dead in this country for decades.
t1_duakyk0	1	*	I still think the information is valid, back then and now. How you doing.
t1_duaegn6	0	*	Oh so you claim the New York Times is reporting this?   Why lie so brazenly? 
t1_dua6atx	0	*	Jews are an ethno-religous group or an ethnicity, race is pretty arbitrary
t1_dub4lab	1	*	He wasn't wrong.
t1_duaapwp	0	*	That's not the point.  The point is that when people bring up that Judaism isn't a race, it's almost exclusively as a bizarre semantic dodge to justify prejudice.
t1_duacgin	0	*	aren't sword wounds just blood leaks?
t1_dua6d00	0	*	In that line of thought there are racial/ethnic divisons among white and black people as well.

t1_dt3az0v	1	*	If you fix broken things, and no things need fixing, busy work is not the answer. 
t1_dt3shnq	1	*	I agree. I demanded a 40% raise on an already decent salary because I knew my value and how much cash I brought to the firm and I got it. Risky move that paid off. These down voters are idiots.

t1_du61fq9	1	*	It's slightly disturbing that you put such precise price tags on these things. It's more disturbing the fact that my price tag would be way lower.

t1_due1f82	0	*	Interesting. Out of curiousity, is it 50% ownership by a citizen or by any legal person?
t1_dudmawa	1	*	The hardware is pretty cheap. It's the IP that's where the profits are at. That's why Apple is one of the most profitable companies in the world, not some assembly for manufacturing company.

t1_dv3mswg	1	*	See that quite a bit with the brexit stuff. Someone will sayI voted remain but... And then end up supporting the leave position
t1_dv321bu	0	*	People would just make more bots. You (Reddit) either ban them altogether or stfu when they do things you disagree with.

t1_dv3bbwc	0	*	Insightful, thank you for an honest answer. 
t1_dv3l2n1	1	*	What you think could be the explanation doesnt really matter. Youre not the person with the tools and access to investigate 
t1_dv398g4	1	*	Dammit, they got to the Canadians... :'(
t1_dv3blnx	1	*	And I mean, I really don't think our intelligence agencies are that dumb, either. There's no way they haven't been monitoring Reddit for a long time.
t1_dv8xoki	1	*	Surprised youre not banned yet. Maybe Reddit hasnt gotten to you yet.

t1_dv3apy7	1	*	The day Trump is impeached or the day the sub is banned is the day all of its users turn over and laugh about how they were doing it all ironically and we all just fell for the joke. 
t1_dv36s8w	1	*	They won't ban the sub because they are cooperating in an active investigation and want to chase down all the leads before closing up shop.
t1_dv4fe2s	0	*	Journalism shouldn't be allowed because it makes conservatives look bad?
t1_dv37n4n	0	*	And what exactly has agent Orange done to rectify the situation? He hasn't even acknowledged it, he's so scared shitless right now. Obama wasn't perfect, but at least he wasn't a traitor and a coward
t1_dv3irgk	1	*	To be fair, 4chan is a pretty sophisticated hacker.
t1_dv3t7bs	1	*	ok
t1_dv36pmm	1	*	When did the left decide to become Mcarthyists based on a dozen or so Russians posting memes? It's way too ironic.

t1_dv36331	1	*	no doubt

t1_dv3rejb	0	*	Flu shots are given for free because insurance companies deem them to lessen the overall cost. They are monetarily the smartest thing to do
t1_dv3cn8b	1	*	TD is full of shit  everyone who posts in there is either a gibberish idiot or a russian  fuck the right and the alt-right
t1_dv395vh	1	*	I thought /r/The_Dotard was a parody sub of /r/The_Donald? They might be a bit harsh sometimes but I don't know if I'd go as far to call them a *hate site filled with leftist extremists*.

t1_dv3esf2	1	*	What? Of course it would be censorship. It's legal and Reddit has every right to, but it still IS censorship. 
t1_dv44rsw	0	*	That is not true. Anti-trump protest were Russian sponsored.

t1_dv3f4uf	1	*	Scottish Rite Dormitory 
t1_dv3a4ku	1	*	Icahn pulled out a million shares of a company that imports steel days before the tariffs were announced. Icahn was a Trump advisor during the campaign. 
t1_dv37ba7	1	*	I love the irony of you talking about how Reddit is fucking shit up, and then someone goes and donates money to them in your name.
t1_dv36ivq	1	*	You can always just create a throwaway account, but I feel you.

t1_dv3mj24	1	*	My god the cringe never ends with Trump supporters.
t1_dv36trk	0	*	> A ton of people who didn't understand satire took it seriously, and here we are.  That's like 4chan in one sentence.

t1_dv380qi	1	*	> Reddit admins just let it fly  Given the article, investigators may be preventing the admins from doing anything about it.
t1_dv3529g	1	*	YOU TAKE THAT BACK
t1_dv39tf3	1	*	I see what you did there
t1_dv3n8mc	0	*	TD seems to be particularly bad compared to the other echo chamber subs. Try posting something critical of Trump there and see how long it takes you to get banned.
t1_dv3erw3	1	*	It's really just an agenda. The way a story is framed can change the entire thing. I'm glad you pointed this out though. The Reddit hysteria doesn't help at all. 
t1_dv36jns	0	*	That's a 100% lie. 
t1_dv3a61e	0	*	Dude, that's what the trolls did - they're not stupid enough to post directly from Russian ips, they used American vpns.
t1_dv3iyxk	1	*	When dealing with a hostile nation state it is best to rely on anonymity.

t1_dv3g2jc	1	*	I got a new account because I was banned from r politics and r news for my views. Also, if you're interested in propaganda, look no further than mainstream media.
t1_dv3jh2v	0	*	Oh my god. Youre joking right?  Both of those subs are ridiculous.    /r/politics used to be an unbiased news source. Its just as bad as /r/thedonald
t1_dv3j7sn	1	*	Id rather listen to liberal American propaganda than any Russian propaganda. But then again, I prefer a lot of American things to Russian things
t1_dv39dvs	1	*	It was probably guilded by Russian bots, along with the comments saying wow t_d is SO stupid to get trolled by Russians trying to divide our country. That would never happen to MY side. :\^)
t1_dv37j3r	1	*	Yes...yes they are.
t1_dv39370	1	*	Is no one going to mention its like 3 subreddits that are alt right and the majority of reddit is incredibly left leaning?
t1_dv377s4	1	*	Like fuck you can. Those big babies banned me from their safe place for saying and why is that?. They are very fragile. 
t1_dv3cdi7	1	*	She wasn't random. She put herself out in the political spectrum and was working with Russians to sway public opinion. 
t1_dv3clj7	1	*	A worse version of /r/Drama.

t1_dv39pe4	1	*	Once she won the nom it became anti trump oveenight
t1_dv3oder	1	*	Weird. That rarely happens on here. 
t1_dv39w7a	1	*	I wouldn't be surprised to read better a russian than a democrat
t1_dv3aiod	1	*	Meh. I don't agree with you fully. I think they know that something like this is bad for business. The backlash is crazy when it comes out that a Company turns a blind eye to unethical behavior.
t1_dv3ewtn	0	*	yeah no. these people are idiots if you couldn't figure that one out already.

t1_dv36wme	1	*	This kind of false equivalence is what GOT US INTO THIS MESS IN THE 1ST PLACE
t1_dv3il09	1	*	They ban fatshaming and steroidsourcetalk but let the biggest evil empire grow minions in the backyard. Way to go reddit
t1_dv3uzxb	1	*	Completely disagree, it's nothing but bots and trolls down voting real voices constantly.

t1_dv33g19	1	*	look, division does not mean the automatic gainsaying of anything the other person says.   division is an *intellectual process*.
t1_dv3f9qk	1	*	Oh shit SRDD is gonna be on fire too
t1_dv355bb	1	*	The politics sub (and every sub really) has been infiltrated by bots and shills. They had to ban some share blue people recently iirc. 
t1_dv37vz3	0	*	This is a LIE. r/worldnews does not ban people for pro-trump comments. Nor does politics or politicaldiscussion or even Hillary. 
t1_dv399y7	1	*	Didn't the government's rejection of joining the EU cause riots in Kiev which caused the President to flee to Russia and prior to the invasion? 
t1_dv3xik1	1	*	You take Reddit way too fucking seriously. Delete your account, go outside and breathe some fresh air.

t1_dv3jpos	1	*	Hiroyuki don't give a fuck
t1_dv3754e	1	*	This is subverting the issue by dismissing it. Saying nobody should take it seriously is just I was only joking! in a different way.

t1_dv3j13t	1	*	And then she literally starts ranting about Clinton for no fucking reason.  
t1_dv3903l	1	*	If the admins hit this sub they have to hit the alt-left subs to. You can't show favoritism as a company in my opinion. They blatant racism on both sides should be squashed.
t1_dv3bqq7	1	*	You're high as a goddamn kite if you think /r/worldnews administers bans to the same degree as the_donald
t1_dv3byfx	1	*	Shit.
t1_dv372bo	1	*	I've seen posts on politics sub saying it's time to take back the country,  and a leftie went out to assassinate Congress members.  Breeds all sorts of people, this site.  
t1_dv37ny1	1	*	nope, seen numerous pro-trump posts, they get removed if its not an international post and if it is they get down voted because most people in the world and America hate trump
t1_dv37dgr	1	*	Liberals believe in flu vaccines, so we'd better not.    That's all the reasoning required by them.
t1_dv37y24	1	*	If you ban the alt right subs you must also ban the SJW subs  Then everyone bitches about thought police  Then we all keep using Reddit anyway
t1_dv39o9k	1	*	It's conflicting, because on the one hand, I want as little censorship on Reddit as possible. On the other, this clearly cannot be allowed to continue.
t1_dv3rqv6	0	*	TIL. The_Donald is purely and exclusively about limiting illegal immigration.  What and bizarre validation for what is being discussed here. 
t1_dv36tr8	1	*	Get that troll shit out of here its pretty obvious what youre doing.
t1_dv36nzf	1	*	To me at least it seemed like satire at first but then [Poe's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe%27s_law) kicked in.
t1_dv3jnkz	1	*	Nope, just like this thread, lotta downvotes for saying anything bad about DNC/members.

t1_dv3p2ux	1	*	I don't know why people are so surprised that people used a online forum to post ideas. It's hilarious that they're blaming the election loss on this though. 
t1_dv3t972	1	*	If everyone stopped using Reddit until they managed the situation it would happen. But the Reddit addiction is strong.
t1_dv30yv3	1	*	You must not have read the article, can't say im surprised
t1_dv34qz0	0	*	>Reddit is harboring a alt-right breeding ground and done nothing but shrug about it.  They may have been instructed to do nothing because people are gathering evidence.
t1_dv3rc43	1	*	That is the worst analogy I have ever seen.

t1_dsgdvg3	0	*	You said they aren't defined by no precipitation.  Maybe you were stressing the _no_ part, but I'm saying they're _litteraly_ defined by their lack of precipitation. 
t1_dtc3yih	1	*	You realize ww2 started when Nazi Germany invaded and claimed Poland for their empire... So polish people had no choice, you make it sound like they were will fully in cahoots with the Nazi's.

t1_dt6om3b	1	*	That sounds like a extremely hypocritical and double standard...  If you run a red light, do you think it matters in the eyes of the cops if you were texting or receiving a blowjob?
t1_dt5j8nh	0	*	I agree, but I am susceptible to knee jerk reactions when I saw the name Trump. It's had to not immediately have a side when you don't like a person.
t1_dt5gw9q	1	*	Nah, future candidates need to be taught that a Trump campaign leads to a useless, pointless administration.  He ran a scorched earth campaign, and must be made to live with the consequences.
t1_dt8wmen	0	*	No, but they are poor and also jave very little power over the way they are treated.  They get what they are given.

t1_dtd2h4g	1	*	How did we get from my statement to me supporting Trump? It's not even close to being that simple.  And it's Trump's DAUGHTER in the headline.
t1_dtc2qhx	1	*	Its sad to me all the stupid shit that goes on there yet there are people homeless and hungry and people won't help them. 
t1_dsel80s	0	*	Donald Trump wasn't considered racist until he pushed the racist idea that Obama was a secret Kenyan Muslim.  Before that he was a centrist who believed Oprah would make a great running mate for him. 
t1_dszftba	0	*	Seldomly
t1_dszos71	1	*	1/10 troll
t1_dsm51ps	1	*	well, it's an unresolved Chinese civil war. In a civil war, things happen, like war.
t1_dtbkpgu	1	*	Always at 12:00!
t1_dt9w6b8	1	*	Yes it is. People should stop calling it winter time.
t1_dt9rhol	0	*	It's much easier to change your clock than changing the schedules of all schools, trains, buses, and workplaces?
t1_dtbkzdb	1	*	Is it because of the shock when you realise you were late to work because you forgot the stupid rule exists?
t1_dta9a6i	1	*	Yeah your right normal time is during winter, I do acknowledge that though in a response 
t1_dtqqyh4	0	*	I think the military wants more, and I think they want enough that just having them on our side would be a huge deterrent.

t1_dsl14om	1	*	Not worse than the current state our country is thanks to our pretty-boy-faced puppet president.
t1_dsldth9	0	*	Well it's pretty important if he believed this *while* he was president. 
t1_dsk715n	1	*	You got that right.  This is a sick country. 
t1_dsk8nue	1	*	NSFL warning, literally a video of a baby seal being clubbed. as /u/eduardog3000 said.  Reposting it after deleting the first comment? GJ,  /u/NigelCTownsend , jackass.

t1_dsexrgf	0	*	It is entirely possible for a company to be sexist to both genders.
t1_dsezbpz	1	*	Go read the memo again.  While I can see why some people didn't agree with parts, I didn't see anything which warranted summary dismissal over.

t1_dsez3h5	1	*	How's a percentage of how many whites there are in the company describe the racism situation there?   People that I worked for hire people based on merit, not skin colour or gender. 
t1_dsfv1q5	1	*	My opinion is false and a flat out lie? Seriously. Do you understand English?
t1_dsfdu07	0	*	omg, you again? are you stalking me or something?
t1_dsevz5g	0	*	How is it fascist that a company won't allow a person on the campus? They have every right to deny entry to people that don't work there.

t1_dsf49l4	0	*	There is written evidence of you saying you hate, and I quote, straight white cis guys. Would you mind explaining how that is *not* any of the things I just listed?

t1_dsx6wzm	1	*	I'm just going to keep saying no because there is no evidence.  Did you also know unicorns exist?
t1_dsxew4k	0	*	Most people in Danzig agreed with German annexation of that city. Was it a good thing in 1939?
t1_dsxh0vb	0	*	The Crimeans wouldn't dare to speak against the Russian occupation since it would make them end up in jail.
t1_dtreklt	1	*	Don't forget the bots!
t1_dtrfzjw	1	*	They have no idea.  
t1_dtrajzk	0	*	Could you take a screenshot or gif of your screen, really interested to see how it works.? Please if you do, a reminder to blur out any names or personal info.
t1_dtrwqyd	1	*	Once you've built a system that can send out a million spam messages, it doesn't really cost anything more to send out 2 million. They don't care that you don't care.
t1_dtrdvbk	1	*	Nuh naaaaa its different
t1_dtrd1sk	1	*	I would argue that as well as Facebook trying to be more than what it should've been. The relentless shared videos annoyed the shit out of me, there's other sites for that, chill.
t1_dts7urj	1	*	Haha, that's fair.  I was trying to say there's no clear-cut way for me to delete it, should I give it the effort to try?
t1_dtrspia	1	*	You can still use it in chronological order, you just need to select it every damn time.
t1_dtrg08d	1	*	I spend 90 percent of my social time on LinkedIn now. Far more valuable professionally and as a connector 
t1_dtrdub4	0	*	Ya but at least there's a LOT of niche subs with lots of interesting information. Facebook is just.. drama and vanity
t1_dts0k6j	1	*	So unfollow them.

t1_dtrztp3	1	*	Unfriend your mom. It's the only answer. Or dump your facebook
t1_dtrm13m	1	*	I much prefer Reddit. I'm not comparing myself to everyone I know on here and everyone is anonymous. 
t1_dtrbmuo	1	*	Basically ad wall?
t1_dtrbqn4	1	*	I know hes not stalking me, but it makes me never want to interact with a page knowing some guy I talked to twice in high school may see my comments and like them.
t1_dtrdw36	0	*	When stupid friends share some radio station's clickbait video, where does that end up?
t1_dtrq50j	1	*	This is going to annoy the hell out of me as the sponsored posts are all I use Facebook for; its the best way to find out about events Im interested in.
t1_dtre48f	1	*	Yep, I completely agree. Its like having someone listen into a private conversation and share your details at random. Its seriously fucking creepy. I wont comment on a business page ever again. 
t1_dtrj9vt	1	*	Try friendly for Facebook, it can sort in chronological order
t1_dtrid15	1	*	A lot of the college and high school kids that used facebook circa 2005 would be the parents today. The demographic shift was inevitable. 
t1_dtrr6uk	0	*	unfortunately for me, my family business is software engineering so my dad does use reddit. i dont think we float in the same spheres, luckily 
t1_dtrcnow	1	*	Heh we're so much better than Facebook. Fuck Facebook, right guys?
t1_dtsp3cm	1	*	It's more that one side is just massively downvoted or silent. 
t1_dtrtpdg	0	*	You know you can just buy things from friends face to face, right?
t1_dtrdlqr	1	*	Like I deactivated my account. People from work asked me about it because they couldn't find me or tag me in pictures anymore, but I still have the app where I can message people. 
t1_dtris6n	0	*	Who's dissatisfied? Some self-selecting Redditors? My news feed is still full of people posting stuff, and the click bait really has fallen since the redesign. 
t1_dtreilc	0	*	South Park episode where they presented Zuckerberg as basically a robot, with this horrible dabbing.
t1_dtrfxrz	1	*	'Rip inbox'  You realise you can disable comment replies yeah?

t1_dtrv9e9	1	*	Too true 
t1_dtro4l6	1	*	Honestly I would love this. It would make things so much better and easier. 
t1_dtrd6ly	1	*	When I'm in Santa Fe, NM I *always* find myself very specifically needing the unparalleled people watching at the Walmart on Cerrillos Road. Back me up, competitive people watchers everywhere.
t1_dtrjryj	1	*	What is real...
t1_dtsi4p8	1	*	>I'm not even straight  Okay but can you just put your dick in her pussi? Damn, always complaining! Since when do you have to be straight to put a dick in the pussi? Like it's not a big deal.
t1_dtrezmm	0	*	i feel like unfollowing is just the surface of the problem. im still not going to be able to see post from the other 900 friends i have...
t1_dtrgftk	1	*	Exactly, if I was interested in Monday Memes I would have followed it myself
t1_dtriit2	1	*	RIP /u/ClassicPervert, he/she was a good friend.
t1_dtrbd8s	1	*	a lot of music forums are still around and thriving. kanyetothe is an extremely popular forum for hip hop listeners and atrl exists for pop music fans

t1_dtrdj63	1	*	probably dodged a bullet... 
t1_dtrlmj4	1	*	I remember back in ~2012, I used to read every single post on my network. I would read until I saw where I left off last time. Now I barely read any of it because none of it is actually interesting.
t1_dtrfcag	1	*	Don't go on Facebook then? 
t1_dtrosuy	1	*	It ruins the flow of my 9 second video of a Samoyed puppy putting its head under the tap. If you haven't already, join the #DeleteFacebookApp party
t1_dtt15sp	1	*	He must be really eager for people to spend half of their shift on Facebook pretending they are sly and original by fucking around at work.  I'd prefer to hire people without Facebook, honestly.
t1_dtrocvp	1	*	My girlfriend's aunt sends her mom messages about how she has to like the things she posts. It's weird
t1_dtrboyy	1	*	You sound like one of my friends. Sadly he refuses to make contact even when I try.
t1_dtsous3	1	*	Exactly why snapchat is a soon to be ghost. It has nothing proprietary and its base is much smaller. People over 30 don't use it/won't use it. 
t1_dtrbur5	0	*	I hated the disappearance of the invision / vbulletin / phpbbs of yesterweb. :(   You could go to different forum domains and not have baggage follow you around.

t1_dtrq63x	1	*	your boss was a moron
t1_dtr902k	0	*	VR social media is gonna be insane in the next decade. So many people bought Rifts and Vives just for VRchat apparently.
t1_dtrcswe	1	*	A specific thing? More like 8 diverse things and I don't feel like making 8 stops.
t1_dts2l09	1	*	They want to convert you. 
t1_dtrmydy	1	*	Not always   But in my experience many shared posts are crap

t1_dtrvrl7	1	*	Lol. This may be the most ironic post I've ever read. Haha starting with the user name. Thank you for giving me a laugh today.

t1_dtrmng2	1	*	I'm liking it less and less. The worst is when people screen cap their Twitter and post it to Instagram... It's like, bitch, I don't go on Twitter for a reason.
t1_dtrnj4r	1	*	This is when I stopped using Instagram too! I hate how the newsfeed is. I want to see posts from all my followers. Not just two or three people. Ugh. 
t1_dtrhn7p	0	*	Reddit is way more addictive but nowhere near as socially damaging as facebook.
t1_dtrd5qy	1	*	There's no Walmart in NYC proper, so we always hunt for Walmart just to see what it's like whenever we go on road trips!  We go there intentionally! 
t1_dtr9qfa	0	*	If you are a liberal, I doubt you'd take anything from r/donald seriously.  Reddit is just comprised of a bunch of circle jerks. 
t1_dtraxyz	1	*	Haha so long as you are happy U0001f601
t1_dtrrc48	1	*	Had someone who'd always share chain letters for this reason. 
t1_dtrpzzs	1	*	Haha, you're right. Credit card offers are more humane.
t1_dtrduh2	1	*	Apparently the algorithm favours videos more so pages that post images just put them in video format so more people see their stuff
t1_dtrggwh	0	*	EXACTLY!!! echo chambers are such bullshit. I prefer antisocial media like Reddit where people have original thoughts!
t1_dsix8he	0	*	Hm sound like a certain leader I know

t1_duhtc2e	0	*	Why would you ban things that aren't harmful? 
t1_dujccg2	1	*	The Daily Mail is a *tabloid* and a propaganda outlet. Fuck it. Also, African countries are also used as dumping grounds for foreign waste as well.
t1_duhub6e	0	*	He just means alcohol in general, as in pick your poison  ITT: All the people telling me Venom is actually a drink without telling me what is in it.
t1_duhqo3t	1	*	Did you read the comments that you were replying to? Or my comment?   Banning cotton buds made from plastic is not the same as banning cotton buds. A small, but important distinction.

t1_dui3mns	0	*	Whats 9gag Ive been on Reddit for... 10 years? This is where I lurk
t1_duinlyi	1	*	buy some of the US's corn straws.  They tend to stay together pretty well, feel like plastic, are biodegradable, but they melt in heat, so no coffee stirring. 
t1_dt8sm6a	1	*	happy to help! *headbangs politely*
t1_dt9a2la	1	*	Just because hes an idiot doesn't mean hes an evil war mongering nuclear craving dictator. This is exactly why he won the election, because of people like you comparing him to such things.

t1_dtkttb2	1	*	Yeah unfortunately (in my humble opinion) it's going to require government intervention of some sort to come out with new antibiotics. They just aren't profitable enough for the big companies

t1_dtgn822	1	*	They can't refute it or distract from it with low effort posts and whataboutism, so plan B is to brigade and downvote it to try to make it go away before too many people read it.
t1_dtgqmh3	1	*	Muller is not a judge.
t1_dthht73	1	*	There's plenty of evidence of their bots on social media, thank you very much. Don't pretend you didn't know that.

t1_dtg4sux	0	*	And this person in particular was implying they were against all sanctions.
t1_dtgldt1	1	*	He is not violating the constitution, in this case. The only power Trump has is the hope that Congress won't stop him, which is likely, since congress likes sucking his dick
t1_dtgin1x	1	*	Don't overdo the joke, you'll ruin the effect.

t1_dtgmkle	1	*	I have a bag packed in my car ready for this. It's only a matter of time til they try and fire Mueller. Everyone should head straight to DC and march on the White House when this happens. 
t1_dtg2386	1	*	I'm not concerned about moronic US domestic politics, it bit the world enough in the ass already.
t1_dtgoknd	1	*	Since when has Trump not done something he wasn't supposed to, or done something he was supposed to?

t1_dth3tij	0	*	No offense but I can't really trust people like you, too many agent provocateurs on reddit.  even if turning it violent would be a huge mistake.

t1_dth9y6m	0	*	This isn't about Trump, it's about the stability of the republic. The problem is, most people don't want a republic anymore. They want their team in power, with no opposition.
t1_dtg7fii	0	*	So you justify a bad decision by the existance of other bad ones?
t1_dtgjd4d	0	*	It may be relevant but not here. You're using whataboutism to reduce the severity of Russian support for Trump's 2016 Presidential campaign by saying guys we do it too and people don't like that. 
t1_dtgqgxm	1	*	One of the no votes in the House was Dana Rohrabacher wasn't it? Don't even have to google it, I would bet my life on one of those being Rohrabacher . 
t1_dtgnqrc	1	*	I don't agree that the POTUS is following the agenda of another country, so I don't think so. I also want to clarify your mistake; I am not an american citizen, I am a swedish citizen.

t1_dtyo98b	1	*	They don't.
t1_dtylubv	1	*	Some tweets.  Meanwhile we have superpacs dumping billions into ads supporting their candidates, and we have people paying off the DNC for an unfair advantage.  Downvote away.
t1_dtysmqp	1	*	To be fair, JFK was a dreamboat.
t1_dtyr7rl	0	*	I'm not saying he specifically is a Russian, but we do have pretty clear evidence that Russia meddled in our election and used social media to distribute pro-trump propaganda.
t1_dtz6ovk	1	*	This has basically been answered but to clarify: People are more likely to adhere to their insane beliefs if they think they aren't just *their* beliefs.
t1_du0ekh6	1	*	Does that mean you have a claim on the American throne?
t1_dtz9j2j	1	*	I have a magnet of Putin. It is sarcastic, however.

t1_dtzf54f	1	*	It isnt about going into Afghanistan, it is about half assing it. We took money and troops out of that war and put it to Iraq. That is on Bush.
t1_dtyuehn	1	*	Would your parents really correlate bush speaking badly of putin with him thinking ill of trump? 
t1_dtyo24v	1	*	I never thought of that.....i'll add a pic of Rumsfeld and be sexy as fuck by summer!

t1_dtzfbe5	0	*	Youre right. Trans gay Olympian doesnt have to act like an adult, its not a Democratic thing. 
t1_dtzsf5k	0	*	Yea... that kind of stereotyping is why I quit figure skating. I really was too young to withstand the constant gay jokes. So... fuck you for contributing to the problem.

t1_dux3ho0	1	*	Any source in the media for this? Because this sounds more like an exception to the improvement. Not saying our nurses couldn't use more consideration, respect and help, though.
t1_dux1fol	0	*	Damn greedy doctors, throwing away 11 years for medical education. They obviously don't deserve money for all their hard work through undergrad and medical school.
t1_duy19qr	1	*	Its more of Fuck you don't tell me what do. Charity is a huge deal in America, but people just don't like to be forced into it.

t1_duwm2ua	1	*	$150,000 in debt is great. In reality, it's more like $300k. Besides, most of that $1750 gets used up in livings costs. In reality, it takes years upon years to pay back the debt.

t1_dsmyivn	1	*	The comments were intended to thrill fellow racists and to harm everyone else.  
t1_duac9n0	1	*	Wouldn't it be directly analogous to the form of female circumsicison that only involves removal of the clitoral hood? That one is about as altering as male circumcision.
t1_du9gwhm	0	*	People with down syndrome can live lives and have families, as a man with down syndrome said, [my life is worth living](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQJEoRhkapw), who are you to choose that?

t1_du8udgq	1	*	they both are.  you're just raised by your culture to believe one isn't, just like the people who perform female mutilation don't think it's mutilation either.
t1_du9lhsj	0	*	I kept getting yeast infections on my feet because I never washed them, so my parents had both my feet amputated.
t1_dua3k15	1	*	Haha love this insight 
t1_du9pca0	1	*	they are both mutilation of baby genitals. Something is seriously wrong with you if you support mutilating baby genitals, male or female.
t1_dua3595	1	*	LOL @ Muricans. Most brainwashed people on earth. 
t1_dub7fct	1	*	Exactly.     Germany, Nordic countries have moved towards banning it in the past. The Jewish community arcs up, and its dismissed.  
t1_du9bdrh	0	*	What are you talking about?
t1_du98hqv	0	*	Maybe so, but in doing so they are only really hurting themselves, people will just go elsewhere.
t1_dua3n6d	1	*	Not really a valid comparison at all.
t1_du9suqb	1	*	Snakebites?
t1_du99jen	0	*	Nope, that directly harms them, I would never circumcise my kids for aesthetics alone, especially if it injures them.
t1_du9evab	1	*	Some people need amputation. That doesnt make it mutilation. But if I cut off a piece of a body, just because, its mutilation.
t1_du9a04f	1	*	so the penis is the only part of the body that looks disgusting unless you cut something away? ridiculous beyond belief
t1_du9smvc	1	*	Such a clever response. You must be very smart!
t1_duauou9	1	*	Well, kind of explains the mass incarceration and punishment, settlement building, and disregard for the others, no?

t1_du6wfz0	0	*	Oh, haven't seen Firefly.
t1_du6n0qc	0	*	Those people are wrong. Foreign investment is good news. What's bad news is when citizens do whatever they can to hide money from their home government.  
t1_du6vbtp	1	*	Exactly!  Oh they come here and take our jobs, yes because Americans give them jobs to save money. 
t1_du6me4n	1	*	albeit less directly has significant implications for the impact of those manipulations. Direct manipulation is much more effective and problematic.
t1_du6or4o	1	*	> The only difference, in China the government controls the corporations.   Sounds like fascist economics. 
t1_du6t2mo	1	*	Actually many new corporations are privately held. Granted many by former insiders. But even China is facing the old question of who has more power Government or Corporations. 
t1_dud1861	1	*	That is what they are claiming right now, that it is all over and Trump is vindicated.  The delusion is so beyond my understanding at this point.
t1_dtaq3se	1	*	All the big airline manufactures do. Airbus from the EU, bombarier from Canada. Countries have decided that Airline Manufacturing is critical and needs to stay in country
t1_dsbb8td	0	*	Thanks for making my point. Guilty until proved innocent.

t1_du7k104	0	*	Italy?As an Italian never heard we ever conducted any operation.
t1_du8cu2u	1	*	Seems more like the West trying to gain absolute control to me.  Can we not let Russia have one remaining ally in Syria?  Nope, gotta find any excuse to overthrow him, damn any of the consequences.

t1_du80r4x	1	*	As does every military force in the world, yeah.
t1_du7qw5g	1	*	No, unlike Russia the US doesn't try to hide it's support for rebels. And the US people wouldn't buy it if the government was trying to hide it anyway. One of the benefits to a free press.

t1_dt4p0hx	1	*	But you've just made a mistake. If it ever got to that stage then Russia would've let ICBMs loose.
t1_dt4lwc4	0	*	In these ICBM days military is only useful as a soft power, or against weak states. If USA ever attacked Russia, the world would be destroyed.

t1_dt1tyak	1	*	Yeah, I don't know why people keep regurgitating that stat like it blows the whole thing apart. Being in the top 1% and wanting to reduce inequality aren't mutually exclusive.

t1_dugt71m	0	*	I'm so curious about the legal aspects of this. Like, does she need some kind of 'visa' to stay in Iraq to complete her sentence? Does she have to leave the country once it's completed?

t1_dswwyli	0	*	Another victim of the media. Obama is a fake persona. he promised he would pull out all troops, yet bombed the living shit of the Middle East.

t1_dsvc6bk	0	*	It's true that American citizens voted for Trump, thank you for that brilliant observation. Everything else you wrote is nonsense. Now stop ruining our country, you miseducated cretins.
t1_dsxp4eo	1	*	No that's Japan's stereotype, albeit a well founded one. 
t1_dsv20tg	0	*	30% of latinos voted for trump

t1_dsvjjwl	0	*	Yeah I'm sure that's the reason
t1_dsvrwor	0	*	I would love to know where this bullshit story originated from. Not a single person I know that has traveled has ever felt the need to hide the fact they're American. 
t1_dsw4e2b	1	*	Such as?
t1_dsvl5hw	1	*	Yes that is what he was saying.
t1_dsv7peu	1	*	I can be pissed at Trump, as the Head of State, without always laying out how both parties enable Israel.
t1_dsvcj79	1	*	Speak for yourself.  It's so interesting watching Euro's get all bent out of shape over US politics.
t1_dsviumz	0	*	From what i understand Trump isnt patriotic at all.
t1_dswqwiw	0	*	> Promises of laws that make outsourcing of jobs less profitable for employers, leading to hiring more Americans and producing domestically.  May I see these laws please?
t1_dsvuayw	1	*	I'm an American. It's a stereotype Americans have about themselves that came from World War II Greatest Generation hero worship.
t1_dsvwzb5	1	*	It's hilarious to see how the birther pigs and others called Obama divisive... I mean what is Trump then?
t1_dsw09go	0	*	Aside from the fact that it's bullshit.

t1_dspsvs6	1	*	Comment of the day right here, folks.
t1_dsoizwg	1	*	I agree with both of you
t1_dskpyx5	1	*	The rebuilding [never happened](https://www.propublica.org/article/how-the-red-cross-raised-half-a-billion-dollars-for-haiti-and-built-6-homes) and that foundation pocketed all the money. 
t1_dskc132	1	*	probably never left his state.

t1_dsmjf7h	1	*	I like how you think that but you are 100% wrong. holy shit the left is delusional 
t1_dskeylj	0	*	You clearly know absolutely nothing about Haiti. 
t1_dskwl2t	1	*	They're not shithole countries, because they don't have Trump as their president.
t1_dskq4vu	1	*	and what did  the colonial american states do to the indigenous people during it's expansion?
t1_dskpyap	1	*	how is our murder and infant mortality doing?
t1_dsl2zal	1	*	Do you honestly think that Trump has any idea about the policies and government in Haiti?
t1_dsklfdf	1	*	That's pretty much how we ended up with Trump to begin with.
t1_dsk7f0f	0	*	It let's them know that he rest of the world sees them for what they are  And that their corruption has a consequence   
t1_dskweio	0	*	I could make a good argument that America's a shithole. It's nothing personal against Americans but they'd take it personally all the same.
t1_dsldfck	1	*	You wanna be the new ambassador?
t1_dsl4n7g	1	*	I think the wording is what offends, but other than that, I would agree that they are severely lacking in societal development. 
t1_dski9w4	1	*	We?  Let the asshole speak for his/her self.
t1_dsm9tvo	1	*	Because he's a coward.
t1_dskalh3	0	*	We don't need anything Haiti has or will ever have. Everyone in Haiti could die tomorrow and we would be totally unaffected. 
t1_dskfgn3	1	*	Pretty much every country in the world has a history of genocide and rape.
t1_dsk4qou	0	*	That's really important to me.
t1_dsk6jud	1	*	Then why did you elect them?
t1_dskr6xw	1	*	who is gonna rape norwegian women then?
t1_du19x79	1	*	>Worth minimal amount of time as it has no way of making someone successful financially.  true of nearly all degrees, are you saying people should only learn things to make money?  
t1_du0zng0	1	*	That was very well done, and communicated placebo and Barnum effect very well. 
t1_du1016a	1	*	That's what I figured. My family swears by that stuff
t1_du0woxz	0	*	And you're correct
t1_du11631	0	*	Nope she is old ...70 and has never been overweight. Old hippy who had four of her five sons using a midwife.

t1_du134v8	0	*	Ayurveda is supposed to be effective but it's an ancient form of medicine, sure ginger tea will soothe your sore throat but even generic over the counter modern medicine will cure it completely. 
t1_du2s1if	1	*	Reputation does matter *to some extent* to [community] colleges.
t1_du0ym6i	1	*	And now you know why they canceled the degree U0001f602U0001f602
t1_du0ywvh	1	*	On the bright side, a placebo to fight depression doesn't have those disadvantages.
t1_du6csw2	0	*	I'm pretty sure that song is about adding a spoonful of sugar to your lean to help it go down, never said the sugar was medicinal.  
t1_du18m5f	1	*	I'll take a homeopathic lager as well
t1_du0tb9e	1	*	Alkaline water that is
t1_du1co33	0	*	So, there's your answer.  They aren't studying how to practice Christian magic.  They are studying history and culture.  But then a lot of them go on to practice magic afterwards.
t1_du1xm4m	1	*	Sounds like that would just make you hyper virile and fertile. Although yeah, for a country with over a billion people already that might be a problem.
t1_du109nl	0	*	Scientists do not understand how our brain works at all. Would you like to show me your sources?  You do understand stress plays a major role in illnesses right ?
t1_du15tee	0	*	Unheard of?  It's the 10th biggest college in the province. Full time enrollment of over 11k.  4th biggest outside of the GTA. 
t1_du12lz4	0	*	It might in certain conditions I guess, but I was talking about homeopathy which is included in AYUSH. 
t1_du0yeih	1	*	How you seen how much coke Americans drink? We'd probably have more cancer
t1_du15x9h	1	*	Because its just water.
t1_du1s0np	1	*	It was many years ago
t1_du2ou64	1	*	I dont think you do. Comparing your home remedies to a medicine that is not appropriate for the condition is not evidence that your home remedies work. 
t1_du1aawl	1	*	You'd be drowning in profit.
t1_du1721j	1	*	But it is taking advantage of the sick, given that generally speaking sick people are the ones buying medicines. Or in the case of homeopathy, scams.
t1_du12qfc	1	*	No I'm just schizophrenic ^they're onto me
t1_du27li3	1	*	Woah. That's strong stuff.
t1_du0sx1k	0	*	Eventually it'll turn out right thanks to the laws of inverse probability or something.
t1_du157jp	1	*	Well, water cures death by dehydration within a few days, which is a potentially larger health issue than cancer if it weren't for all the water.
t1_du0tj63	0	*	So nothing like a chiropractor then.
t1_du0v2xx	1	*	No, hes just tripping on acid
t1_du0xywh	0	*	Im sorry, twatwaffle cuntnuggets.
t1_du1ckrp	1	*	Wow. Well perhaps if those were also the requirements for someone to *approve* the course, this would never have been an issue in the first place.
t1_du1hwpw	1	*	Yep. And then the babies always start wailing and the parents just say there there, you're going to be feeling way better soon! and then they thank the chiropractor on the way out. It's sickening.
t1_du0ui0n	1	*	( xb0  xb0)
t1_du0tral	1	*	100% of the people that were cured of cancer drank water. Solid proof for me.
t1_du0zcer	1	*	But are you micro dosing it?
t1_dtbz90n	1	*	It's not the effort that gives value to money. Money retains value because its total amount is limited. This is just a way to move money. Not so simple.

t1_dtkdq9x	1	*	That's the whole point.  http://www.savewealth.com/planning/estate/foundations/

t1_dsylh0d	1	*	Correction, shitty economy that has vastly improved since he first came to power. His popularity among Russians isn't just because of his bare-chested good looks, you know. 
t1_dsxu3oe	1	*	Uh let me tell you about this thing called colonization
t1_dsy6d8j	0	*	Are you serious or being sarcastic? If youre serious may I tell you a great leader who was not rich at all? Ataturk was not rich. And hes one of the greatest leaders the world has ever seen.
t1_dsx946p	0	*	When it comes to real war against major powers, America always watches it's interests burn.  Remember how George Bush stood with Georgia against Russia. U0001f914

t1_dsxc9sf	1	*	that's the point :)

t1_dsxzqpd	0	*	Fighting one group of terrorists doesnt preclude you from being terrorists yourself. YPG is just PKK with a new name honestly
t1_dsxeo1q	0	*	When he bombed that Syrian base, I would say. 
t1_dsxk6cx	1	*	those are some pretty ignorant statements
t1_dsx3w1f	1	*	NATO isn't designed to stop anything like this it is designed as a defensive alliance, it is not designed to stop individual members from offensive incursions.
t1_dsxbt2e	1	*	This comment inflates the YPG with the Kurds as a whole.
t1_dsxn1n8	0	*	Perfectly fine. Spain was self determinig itself very well.
t1_dsx7f78	1	*	> US is assembling an army with Kurds  lol, nope.  They're doing it with Arabs
t1_dsy1q76	1	*	What is pathetic is a nation that is led by a megalomaniac wannabe sultan. Leave the kurds alone, stop trying to start shit with everyone, psychos. 
t1_dsxvsmp	1	*	I know all those things. But the West (not just the US) clearly didn't give a fuck when carving Israel out of Palestine, so why care now?
t1_dsx8uh5	1	*	My selection for best terrorists in Syria is the Kurds! Because they get support from America and Israel.

t1_dtkrjpm	0	*	right?  who cares if it is done for voters, as long as this becomes the norm.  
t1_dtkljyn	1	*	We already pay for emergency medical care for everyone. Paying for preventative care would reduce total cost. You are literally arguing for increased costs and poorer service.

t1_dsx3f4y	1	*	Up to a certain amount. Carry too much of it, or have too many plants, and you're punishable. I think it's 5 grams on your person, and 5 plants max, IIRC.

t1_dtg4nxb	1	*	Like I said, devil's advocate. I don't even have a side, I've never been in the UK. Just pointing out how to someone on the Leave side going back on the vote could look pretty anti-democratic.
t1_dtg3xda	1	*	Hmmmm it's like sitting in a room where everyone hates you but you keep saying I'm great it's THEM that have the problem. Not the fact you spit in the coffee pot.
t1_dtg6nr5	1	*	Well said friend. Much love from Canada, I find your last paragraph particularly important in today's society. 
t1_dtgs895	1	*	as a Gen-X, its depressing to see how we had to see such a shit generation make a mess in front of us, and its equally disheartening to see an even worse generation is going to follow us. 
t1_dtg82te	1	*	Brexit voters are far more entrenched to regret their mistake.
t1_dtg4p1b	0	*	Because it is sad that someone is honestly suggesting a revote without realizing the precedent it would set.  It shows the level of ignorance and emotion driven thinking that permeates our society. 
t1_dtgckqm	1	*	Let's see in 20 years
t1_dtglnvi	0	*	Your representatives were voted for. The only people not voted for were the commission. Stop with the dishonesty buddy.
t1_dtgduv1	1	*	To those who lost 
t1_dtg4q8y	0	*	Well said.  What's the solution to prop up liberalism?  Redistribute wealth to the undercut middle/lower class?
t1_dtgsnrt	0	*	Whats it like being so high and mighty you disregard other people's OPINION.
t1_dtgajy5	0	*	What is the EU Parliament, then?
t1_dtfryh1	0	*	I tend to take the view that if you're not going to be alive in 20 years, you probably shouldn't vote on things that are going affect people in 20 years. 
t1_dtgjjnf	1	*	> Only if you listened to so called experts Old ~~George~~ ~~Nigel~~ Tim's coasters down the pub are a much better source of information.

t1_dtmh4ww	0	*	ah, goody. I got a masters in econ, so....
t1_dtgaoy0	1	*	The idiots who voted for brexit don't know that.
t1_dtg47e6	1	*	Seems like the real issue is another country meddling via social media....
t1_dtg4bet	0	*	This is such a load of Alex Jones garbage
t1_dtg0fd4	1	*	Incorrect, his history checks out.  These were both in the same thread.   He copy pasted the same response, but he's genuine. 
t1_dtgbneg	0	*	It's not though, unless you want to get pedantic about whether Democrats are actually progressives.
t1_dtg37tt	1	*	When google searches for what is the EU spiked the day after the referendum, I would suggest the citizens didn't even do their bare minimum before voting either.   Failure all around. 
t1_dtg3uo9	0	*	A couple hundred that we know of. 
t1_dtgms4z	0	*	Close enough. :)
t1_dtg2dd2	1	*	And it was still only 72%. Here in Australia we got a higher turnout in our voluntary postal survey for gay marriage. 
t1_dtg5v8f	1	*	Cicero quote right?
t1_dtftoxg	0	*	That's very Reddit of you. Do you also watch Rick and Morty??

t1_dtg52kk	0	*	Neither was the '75 referendum that kept us in the EU in the first place. 
t1_dtgc3ah	1	*	Idk, Millennials are giving em a run for their money and they just gettin started.   
t1_dtg9vjd	0	*	So keep voting until you get the answer you want? If it had failed to pass would you still want three votes?

t1_dtgbkdv	1	*	listen to what. how did the Eu strip you of your sovereignty? 
t1_dtg9l2j	0	*	>greedy gobshites  This is the best expletive Ive ever read. 
t1_dtfu6i5	1	*	In fairness, the exact number of member states in the EU is one of the last things you should consider when deciding to leave or not.
t1_dtgfjg1	1	*	Try antifreeze
t1_dtg9g9d	1	*	Also, Parliament is sovereign and the referendum was explicitly non-binding.
t1_dtg738v	0	*	Surely that's when it will be wet ?
t1_dtgkqed	1	*	And the real irony with the current negotiations is that we might well end up having to follow the rules set down in Europe, but now no longer having a vote on it.  Sovereignty indeed!
t1_dtvzml9	0	*	Yea, has been theorized for a while. Essentially validates all of the flood myths and changes the current narrative of accepted human history

t1_dtm1q5n	0	*	He's a significant figure in popular culture and not just in the US. Doesn't that count?
t1_dtm1no1	0	*	Yeah we know. The comment was making fun of the fact that OP acted like he figured this out and it was something insightful
t1_dtlzllg	0	*	I think you are right actually, and i've likely just mistakenly thought of them as the same thing.

t1_dtbol3b	1	*	Except all the other kids will stop sharing their candy, toys, backyard pools etc. It's up to the kids if they'd rather fight than have a good time with their friends.
t1_dtyw1uu	1	*	The only one I can tell you about is the protest in Saigon where the police rounded up protestors, detained them in a stadium, and physically beat them into submission. It wasn't pretty.
t1_dtttx8d	1	*	Basically, so long as you don't affect anything, you cam do what you want. The moment you get someone else to listen, they bag you up.
t1_dtu1koj	1	*	Like china, the communist government don't allow you to bring your wealth to outside.   That's why bitcoin  is popular there. 
t1_dttzaf7	0	*	the people of the south has a history of being a little cautious of the government.
t1_dtu7rm4	0	*	Just because this one isn't an American corporation doesn't mean that there aren't American corporations there. I guarantee something in your home has a made in Vietnam sticker somewhere on it.
t1_dttprkz	0	*	of course it is, it always has, where lies poverty lies hunger, where lies money lies greed 
t1_dttonry	1	*	Where would they go? Not many countries are receptive to refugees at the moment.

t1_dtu05cs	1	*	Eat the rich
t1_dtto2oc	1	*	I'm so happy that you are also able to read. Congratulations. Fortunately, because of users like to whom you replied, I don't have to dig through Wikipedia. 
t1_dtttbvx	0	*	You fell for the old free market fallacy. In the end you don't get a fluid market, but cartels like Comcast and Verizon. Republicans are fucking hypocrites. 
t1_dtv5us8	1	*	50 isn't kind of low for one year, Vietnam isn't north Korea,  50 is a lot even here.  I think the party will over do it and lose control soon 
t1_dttq9pm	1	*	I'm impressed by how you condensed hundreds of books on the subject into one concise reason, well done!
t1_dtuervw	0	*	> Man taking pictures isn't a problem.    I dont know about VN, but I know that when in tourist-friendly authoritarian countries, photos can often be a source of problems.
t1_dtvai6w	1	*	Ok, I get your point. Many bad options to choose from 
t1_dtttdlt	1	*	That just makes the headline seem even worse lol...
t1_dttt4rv	1	*	I take kind of a morbid solace in the idea that if we don't get our shit together, our problems will probably be contained on this planet. If there's anyone else out there, they won't have to meet us.
t1_dtttq67	0	*	Can't think of one that hasn't been.
t1_dtu77ck	1	*	I don't think it's the planet that's going to kill us, we're doing it much faster ourselves. 
t1_dtv4xct	1	*	Vietnamese here, im literally willing to put bullets on someone heads (and you know damn well who i mean just by reading this thread) if it means another bloody civil war wont happen.

t1_dtu91zk	0	*	Unfortunately, automation creates fewer jobs than it takes away. The jobs it creates tend to be higher-skill and -paying, yes, but it's still fewer jobs overall. I agree with your other points.
t1_dtu15xx	1	*	Edgy
t1_dttonv0	0	*	It was in the title...
t1_dtu7nti	1	*	Uh.. how about cheer for the day when we grow past this as a species?  Why should we all die just because some people are fucked up now?  Fuck giving up, I wanna see us in space and shit.

t1_dtks2ym	0	*	Damn those tricky Jews and their dirty Jew noses. /s  Seriously though, why are people upvoting such a clearly antisemitic comment? You can criticize Israel without sounding like a neo nazi.
t1_dtjvsyj	1	*	Israel has been heaviliy pushing for boycotts against Iran obsessively for years.  Netanyahu talks of nothing else  Is that racist?
t1_dtjq520	0	*	I did. That's why I'm pro-Israel.
t1_dtjxb5z	0	*	I'm out of the loop, how and who boycotts Gal Gadot? 
t1_dtke8yu	1	*	Land of the free tho
t1_dtklu8l	1	*	Why should they? The Palestinians would, by and large, like to stay on their own damn land. 
t1_dtk6z5z	0	*	well, this was in the early 90's but the southern tip of Israel is really nice with beaches on the red sea.   I hop to go back there one day... depending on when this mess will be over.....
t1_dtjgm1f	1	*	That's reasonable and I agree fully.
t1_dtkn9xx	0	*	Ah yes, the Israelis with their murder camps, how could I forget. Meanwhile North Korea literally _has_ murder camps.
t1_dtkdlbm	1	*	victim
t1_dtjmst6	1	*	Yep. Similar to when Speers' widow tried to sue Omar Khadr for his 10M settlement.

t1_du1s3fw	0	*	Some of those are reasons for male circumcision. None of those are reasons for female circumcision.

t1_dugflz3	1	*	You are a dirty disgusting person
t1_dw2s8p6	1	*	I've gotten over it.  Restoring my foreskin has helped a lot, along with donating to Intact America, and helping save babies from the same mutilation I experienced.  :)
t1_duhh7jc	1	*	> I am Muslim idiot  saving us all the issue of saying it ourselves
t1_dug0833	1	*	You are needlessly limiting a parent's human right to determinen what is best for their child. 
t1_dufjf0s	1	*	You did what you had to do, and because of your actions, your son will grow up to do all the things a man and his penis do.  You did the right thing.
t1_dw0uzvv	0	*	You were probably forcibly retracted before you were ready, causing scar tissue to develop.
t1_dufw15c	1	*	UTI are preventable in other ways.    The rest can wait until he is of legal age.   Penile Cancer risk group are smokers.  
t1_dufromg	0	*	60% of men in the US have been circumcised, are you telling me that their sexuality has been destroyed? That's nonsense. Neither practice can be justified but they aren't equally as damaging either.
t1_dufaf5e	1	*	The difference is the most common outcomes for the two are extremely different.
t1_dw0yabu	1	*	Does that make it ok?
t1_duffgco	0	*	I'm a South African Xhosa person, we get circumcised around 18-21. The whole circumcision school thing. So much fun. 
t1_dugmfm4	1	*	Most people don't think twice about anything until they find out that some people are opposed to it. Hearing the other side can broaden your mind.
t1_dufw7xf	0	*	Or uncircumcised dicks look gross
t1_dufa4ik	0	*	I understand I'm sorry I was a little insensitive to this fact, I just wanted to express my thought in the hopes of better understanding 
t1_dufessl	1	*	Apparently, not as disgusting as forcing people to choose between religion and law. Way to go!
t1_dugh00z	1	*	The equivalent would be cutting out all kids tonsils because a few have to.
t1_dufm4v3	0	*	We should all just remove our testicles then. That way we can't get testicular cancer.
t1_dufm4ww	0	*	...but the benefits are not great enough to recommend universal newborn circumcision
t1_dufcfnv	1	*	Then phimosis can be treated. 
t1_duff3ac	0	*	Could you provide any sources that suggest the US has  4x-8x less serious UTI's in the first two years than Germany?
t1_dufj419	0	*	That would make it 600, in a population of 300,000.
t1_duk9ra4	1	*	Also the American Pediatrics Association. What's best if not getting paid to perform unneeded surgery? Also, the extracted bodypart can then be used to make anti-wrinkle cream. Soft as a baby pee-pee!
t1_dtn1k63	0	*	It's impossible to discuss Chinese problems because you can't bring anything to the table
t1_dt1368u	0	*	Our home air conditioner will fill a 5 gallon bucket on an average humid summer day, if it's especially humid it'll fill it twice. 
t1_dt1ip2b	1	*	The only place it can go is into the initial condensed water, if this works as described.  Most likely it would need to dump the condensed water and regenerate with new, cooler water.
t1_du7t7im	0	*	Serious question: latex (or similar material) carrier bags - viable?
t1_du8esw6	1	*	That's interesting. In UK it led to a fairly significant reduction in plastic bag usage.
t1_du8fpd4	0	*	Just keep the bags in your car like everyone else.
t1_dsujwus	0	*	Name one worse than NK, Syria or Iran??? I know you will say Saudi Arabia but that's not even close. Russia is a terrorist state.

t1_ds9v1wm	0	*	If we're 100% certain that the Caymen was from a farm, then I'm mostly fine with it. Just as long as the producers can be trusted not to accidentally release a load of invasive species by doing so.

t1_duak9vg	0	*	your reason for japans xenophobia (drunkenness by westerners) seems very childish and naive.  it is not the reason for japans extremely strict and nationalistic immigration policy.
t1_duah3zr	1	*	London voted to remain so from now on it's fair enough if all of the wealth stays there.

t1_duyygdj	1	*	> Post-consumer glass is not economically recyclable, at least in the US.  Closed-loop recycling of glass is very common in Europe. This is a cultural/organizational problem, not an economical one.
t1_dsto9tn	1	*	It just sounds like they dont want to face the reality that they dont have actual women boobs and therefor want everybody else play make belief with them, even if that includes medical examinations 
t1_dstjnmb	1	*	Routine checks are offered before breast cancer is discovered.   How the hell would they know what men have breast cancer if they haven't diagnosed them yet??

t1_dsv9btb	1	*	And your answer to that in the meantime is we prevent those who have suffered as a result of these problems from having children? I'm voting on upheaval before we turn to eugenics. Every time.

t1_dsv9boo	0	*	Why do voters in a democratic country have an opinion on political issues? Really?

t1_dsmfszm	1	*	this to me is the reason.  as long as everyone is making money, nobody talks.  but when you're old and dont give a fuck anymore, and then trump says your country is a shithole, then you talk.

t1_dsmoyp7	1	*	Fair point.
t1_dsmfl9r	1	*	BuzzFeed News itself isn't a tabloid, it's separate from their listicles etc. More people on Reddit seem to be realizing that.

t1_dsmc9xd	1	*	Lmao new script? Pot meet kettle

t1_dspda0d	1	*	China is the world's largest importer of oil and gas. They even finished a mega pipeline recently.
t1_dspklh3	1	*	Yeah because the west has never invaded or attacked a country in order to further the political goals of a minority. *Russia* is the big outlier here.

t1_dujba5t	1	*	> liked Nazis  Yeah I'm sure many of them liked people who wanted to genocide them and every non-Aryan race.
t1_dumjbld	0	*	Not for lack of trying to keep it though. US simply threatened to withdraw support so Sinaxef had to be given back.

t1_dun46bb	0	*	That username though...  Jokes aside you are spreading the same agenda pretending to be someone an arab? Is this supposed to be funny?
t1_dun7jn8	1	*	They also receive a lot of well-deserved criticism, though. In addition to the bullshit criticism.  But yes I'm sure some extremely anti-Israel person would manage to complain about this. 
t1_dt5ej2m	1	*	> art of the US in Canada's trade has decreased over the last year. >  > Canada got closer to its t  Australia here, I got spiders..you got beavers..wanna trade?
t1_dt4qdku	1	*	No? I was never against TPP. Did you know that people can actually have their own opinions regardless of what everyone else thinks?
t1_dt5e211	0	*	And when the US begins exporting its own reserves that are infinitely larger, Canada will ask us for aid and subsidy to ease hard times.  To which we will respond with Trudeau is a Homeau

t1_dt5lqwk	0	*	The US wanted more environmental protections? That's interesting.
t1_dt5ww32	1	*	> There were some sketchy things in the old deal such as the corporate sovereignty thing.   You have no idea what this actually is and are just regurgitating inflammatory headlines you read. 
t1_dt4tmvx	1	*	Bad for us, great for the US's corporate interests - particularly those that rely on IP as a sizeable portion of their income.
t1_dt5xskr	1	*	Needs a hyphenated last name too. 
t1_dt57av8	1	*	You're rewriting history but okay. Some people did hate it for the IP provisions, but many other people had other issues with it that have not changed in any form of the agreement.
t1_dt50c2a	1	*	Yea...except i wasnt making a joke.
t1_dt67emi	1	*	LOL, no I'm not. But you're funny!

t1_dt51n50	1	*	Why spend minutes to be informed about major global issues when I can spend hours bashing Trump on reddit?
t1_dt4x374	1	*	Agreed, because it was a subset of Americans that were pushing for those terrible changes so only they benefitted.
t1_dt5ouw9	0	*	What kind of retarded comment is this? In a thread where a number of people have reservations about the TPP. 
t1_dt5w3yy	1	*	I miss RIM though :(
t1_dt56p90	1	*	Those provisions are a lot narrower than you are presenting. Very similar provisions exist in NAFTA and they haven't really caused problems.

t1_dt5pnlg	1	*	Yes. That is what he said.
t1_dt5fayg	1	*	The TPP had a great deal more to criticize than its IP sections. Eg [this ELI5 thread explains](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3nl4sz/eli5_the_transpacific_partnership_deal/)
t1_dt4qbi5	0	*	Depends who you ask. Most Canadians are for trade. Especially now that people are realizing the US can only make 4 year - 8 at most - promises.
t1_dt56tj6	1	*	Sound like the kinds of things America would want eliminated.
t1_dt4wxt3	1	*	Suspended and you know why? So the USA can be baited in to join when a different president comes in. 
t1_dt55ck1	1	*	He did make legal weed possible though. 
t1_dt680k3	1	*	I wonder if that would allow someone to start a Canadian facebook...

t1_dt5dov4	0	*	IMO he did a huge positive with the legalization of marijuana, and a huge negative by reneging on proportional representation. So he's wavering around break-even for me right now.
t1_dt5hel9	1	*	>Canada has pushed for higher labour and environmental standards  Ah yes, because Canada has shown us with the tar sands that they have the *highest* standards for the enviroment...
t1_dt4vohj	1	*	Because all the stupid rules that the US demanded have now been dropped and it is a much more sane trade agreement.

t1_dt5f862	1	*	LOL, so he was just too stupid to post in the right thread?
t1_dt5lje0	0	*	Get a shrink 
t1_dt5e3ln	1	*	No that doesn't make sense because he hates the tpp too and has always hated free trade deals we don't get anything out of. He has hated them forever
t1_dt4oqau	1	*	Why would they be pleased? Those jobs certainly aren't going to magically come back to them if Trump removes us from NAFTA.
t1_dt5gdbt	0	*	I've read zero international trade deals so far, and I can't imagine a circumstance that would make me read one.

t1_dt5ddt1	0	*	Yeah I acknowledged that but ultimately that was just one part of it. America's absence made other aspects worse as well.

t1_du4yj0q	1	*	In case he made it to the White House. Paul Manafort was law partners with Roger Stone for years, and Roger Stone has been pushing Trump to run for president since at least the 1990's.

t1_du4jjq7	1	*	Especially when it's a real word anyways 
t1_du4p5q4	1	*	You should compare Florida prices since Florida was hit a lot harder by the crash than New York, New York.  Nonsensical comparison.

t1_du4mba3	1	*	You could really Summon good prices back then.
t1_du4l34l	1	*	Another thing to note: by purchasing the property for 100 mil you are driving up the property value and can now sell it for a similar price, thus getting your funds back laundered for you.

t1_dtahgnv	1	*	Nothing.
t1_dv0lk37	1	*	Fuck that is infuriating.  There are too many examples like these. How the SA gov can still think this will end well is incomprehensible. 
t1_dv20h6e	1	*	It should. And it does. Race is a social construct. We construct it based on skin color in America. But Africa is another continent, and they do things differently there.
t1_dt5wbpt	0	*	How could they after having banned opposition parties from running? 
t1_dv019j8	0	*	Such losers not having a mass shooting for 22 years. The country is so repressed they don't have active shooter drills in schools!
t1_du9epzn	1	*	Thank you for your response! This is a perspective that I could never experience first hand, but is really worthwhile to understand.
t1_du9c65u	1	*	Yea but they're not **our** monarchs, so they're just Tv celebrities essentially.

t1_du3c919	1	*	 I believe the technical definition of pedophile is someone who is attracted to pre pubescent children, so I think that what this guy meant. Could've been phrased a hell of a lot better...
t1_dtqytut	0	*	I doubt it...I can't speak for them but I'd assume they see it as fighting back and totally justified. Suspicious would be the last thing I think they'd describe it as.

t1_dv4crf5	1	*	People aren't missing it, they're just downplaying the implications of islamic terrorism. Again.
t1_dv42h1r	1	*	Perhaps because religious people care more about education than other people running other schools?  How about those other schools in the area step it up and do better instead?

t1_dskapbf	1	*	No you. The area inside is still UK soil they just are not allowed to enforce their laws.
t1_dsjvs5l	0	*	The charges were dropped, yeah, but they could have reopened the case if they desired to, until 2020, was my understanding
t1_dsjrayb	1	*	Oh well in that case let him go, unless he committed other crimes (not including crimes related to leaking documents)
t1_dsj0sny	1	*	Snowden did not leak to him. 
t1_dsjo73t	1	*	Oh the horror.
t1_dsjsug7	0	*	Yeah I wouldn't be surprised if there's silently a few million dollars slipped in a bank account in the cayman islands under the Ecuadorian President's name. Courtesy of his new best friend (putin)

t1_ds8jn5l	1	*	The only thing that's kept mueller in place is the fact that we're paying attention to it.  As soon as we stop, they'll decide it's ok for him to wrap up the investigation, or be fired.

t1_dtbu541	0	*	Sure we can mould the meaning to fit your agenda. But you have to think they made this name before there was even ANY notion of countries lol.
t1_dtcpiwf	1	*	At leasttheyll be equally outraged.
t1_dt8j5hn	1	*	Why? Then republicans will only read republican ones and vice versa. The information bubbles we surround ourselves in aren't healthy

t1_dtgch44	1	*	i don't know, it's so bizarre i thought it was fake at first, the plane just standing there at the same pace of the cargo  left me with a weird feeling

t1_dt6u0c2	1	*	Asus Zenfones 
t1_dt77ylb	1	*	It's satire.
t1_dt748be	1	*	Yeah but most people who earn 50k a year do not have massive reserves of money stashed somewhere. Most of the big companies do.
t1_dt6za1n	0	*	What elections?
t1_du6u0il	1	*	My kidneys came from a 92 year old woman and my left lung from a 65 year old guy. Really great quality stuff! Old people really have the best organs.
t1_du6sybp	1	*	Yeah, cause that totally stopped abortive remedies.
t1_dsgnxi1	0	*	You ignored everything I said
t1_dtw38iu	1	*	Naw....but Obama deported a ridiculous amount of immigrants and expanded the spying powers now wielded by Trump. 
t1_dtwwnuu	0	*	He's probably just billions of dollars in debt to Russian banks or Russian mob banks.
t1_dtx3h3x	0	*	No, that film focuses on an earlier period in his career.
t1_dtwhfso	1	*	Thanks. They're out in force today. I try to bite my tongue to avoid getting banned again bu they're everywhere today. Keep fighting the good fight.

t1_dtwbam8	0	*	Put your tin foil hat on first. 
t1_dtwl37y	1	*	I just love Tillerson's defeatist attitude. Yeah, they're going to do it again and there's nothing you can really do about that...anyhoo, we really need to help Russia get to drilling in the arctic.
t1_dtwpgm5	1	*	That's because we've shifted away from a left-right divide to a thoughtful-emotional divide. Now you either want to talk about issues  or bond over a shared hatred of minority groups.
t1_dtxjnxg	0	*	You are wrong here.
t1_dtwj8r2	1	*	Not a puppet, you're a puppet! 
t1_dtwt4o8	0	*	So far hes not done poorly. So no, I dont think that its going to be a huge problem for the republicans.  The tax cuts worked for almost everyone who isnt 1% in California and the economy is fine. 
t1_dv0l8yz	1	*	> This is no different than what Putin does to his competitors  Except for the murder, *exactly* the same thing, yeah.
t1_dv1d2ci	1	*	Thats like saying showing holocaust pictures is spreading nazi propaganda..
t1_dv21z0o	0	*	Damn right it is. Euros put the government above the laws. Americans put the law above the government. 
t1_dv0qvop	1	*	Soon they'll ban the French national anthem for being too bloody.
t1_dv23h12	1	*	>The charges were issued against the National Front leader on Thursday for distribution of violent images, the prosecutors office in the Paris suburb of Nanterre said.

t1_dv1jgef	0	*	Then again, the us loses its shit over half a nipple.. 
t1_dv1nfxs	1	*	Jail/fine/whatever.  This is just fascism.  You have to let the shitty portions of your society speak, otherwise they'll just grow in the shadows and become much more of a threat.
t1_dv0sz7i	1	*	Refer to my previous comment and but thank you proving it.
t1_dv1k1qa	1	*	Agreed. If she's being charged for this, it's absurd. Shit like this is what fucks up the left's reputation. As a liberal, I am no fan of her, but I hope these charges are dropped. 
t1_dv0zlhf	1	*	In no way because hes from the UK and doesnt have a first ammendment.
t1_dv1bjtq	0	*	Define 'traditional values'. I've seen the term refer to so many different things 
t1_dv16hys	1	*	But a picture is worth a 1000 words. Plus they do not allow you to type 1000 words in twitter.  In a serious note, this is absurd.
t1_dv2a6v4	1	*	Alright, look. USSR was one mistake. We all make mistakes. I was young and had just gotten over a bad relationship. I'm sorry for starting the revolution.
t1_dv2ao79	1	*	Post a photo of your neighbors dead and mutilated child, without their consent, and see how popular you are as a result. 
t1_dv1riv2	0	*	That's not my intent. I wouldn't accept the Huffington Post either for example. 
t1_dv0vbvj	1	*	I dont think you read the article 
t1_dv1vwdt	1	*	If it makes you feel any better his parents probably drowned trying to save him, so they couldn't give their consent.

t1_dv0mxub	0	*	You burned the bbq? :(
t1_dv0lho8	1	*	Please stop using European as if it is some sort of monolith.
t1_dv10acl	1	*	The establishment really doesn't like far right political parties and they try to shut them down how ever they can.  This is an other one of these attempts to make life difficult for them.

t1_dv0p7kn	0	*	She wasn't arrested though.
t1_dv0ubpg	0	*	I would argue my opinion has the same value as everyone elses, and I happen to think she is scum of the Earth and I absolutely despise her smug idiocy. It's really that simple.  
t1_dv0pbf1	1	*	Touchxe9
t1_dv0lhvr	1	*	If anyone else had done what Le Pen did they would have been arrested too.
t1_dv10tot	0	*	Depends on how gory probably.  Depends on how old the picture is and if they know who it is.
t1_dv0qv0s	0	*	Thats the authoritarian-libertarian axis. Stalinism was about total control and Anarcho-Capitalists dont want any state interference. Youre point stands for the liberal left and conservatives though. 
t1_dv2fbgr	1	*	I don't think it's necessary ATM, but thanks for the concern.   
t1_dv13s6e	0	*	Right. All conservatives hate gays, hate women, hate science and education, anyone who isn't them, basically.  That's a bullshit argument, and you know it. 
t1_dv4l2rc	0	*	I think he means during the operation
t1_dtwdf1v	0	*	Space stuff, I dunno.

t1_dtvfcks	1	*	Just put it in a bag of dry rice
t1_dtvl2ca	1	*	The structure that the car is on has a plaque with the names of 6,000 SpaceX employees on it. Isn't having your name permanently floating through space enough credit?

t1_dtukbyf	1	*	We already did that! Theres all kinds of shit on mars. 
t1_dtum0vn	1	*	People would find a way to bitch about musk out of jealousy even if everyone under him was given equal credit.
t1_dtuvzof	1	*	Same with the engineering team. Its almost like its an organization of people with a lot of different parts dependent on each other all working toward a common goal. If only we had a word for that. 
t1_dtv1kcc	1	*	And Musk plans to take the headlines in two more days when the hidden motors in the mannequin make it stand up and wave to the camera...
t1_dtunfa9	0	*	though ice in space will sublimate.

t1_dtuj7mv	1	*	Closer to a billion years I believe they said on the stream
t1_dturl7p	1	*	Rescue missions are being planned now.  Best guess is that he's in low orbit but can't catch enough atmosphere to slow down.
t1_dtvlhd2	1	*	You are right. It was a failure in the ignition system. Elon explicitly mentioned it in the press briefing. 
t1_dtvn87x	0	*	Engineer here, what do you do?
t1_dtup48a	0	*	Thanks!  So amazing...  Is this going to mars or is it just orbiting Earth?

t1_dtuftff	1	*	They still landed 2/3 of the boosters. It was the first test mission, I am sure they will figure out how to land the core. 
t1_dtum5j6	0	*	Nano manager Elon Musk does those himself. Last time someone tried to fire Musk he responded with 20,000 flamethrowers.
t1_dtv3m1z	1	*	You can wipe off sweat if you're starting to panic, you can use it as clothes, tie it on a stick to carry items, use it as a blanket if it's cold, or roll it up and whip intruders. 
t1_dtuu3ne	1	*	Could have been worse.  A bust of Trump, perhaps.

t1_dshqm30	1	*	Are you fun at tea party though?

t1_dshtiye	1	*	Or Middle East or South Asia.
t1_dshtz8y	1	*	To be fair, Italy kept trying to elect communists. Can't have that shit going on. We need open markets across the globe.

t1_dshym22	1	*	Yeah, Sam Dastyari...
t1_dshtyf8	1	*	But maybe it means that ok and not ok are stupid lenses to be looking through? Maybe it leads us to analyze systems, incentives and power rather than say that country has been unethical!

t1_dshaq2o	1	*	whoosh?
t1_dshqjey	1	*	I concur! However, lets keep things neat and discuss one thing fully at a time!
t1_dshpnbb	1	*	There were no real candidates since Putin came in power. Just Putin and some puppets to keep it seemingly legit. And yes, they still manipulate outcome numbers.  
t1_dshkiw9	1	*	a ton of week old accounts all making the same arguments. Yeah, that's eyebrow raising to me.
t1_dshog2l	1	*	I'd bet money that it's happened.
t1_dshz9xx	1	*	Vague and untrue assertions with no sources? Seems legit : )
t1_dsih61a	0	*	It really amazes me how many Americans are panicked about Russian election meddling and haven't a clue their own country is likely more guilty than Russia on the same allegations.
t1_dshdgfc	1	*	You forgot /s
t1_dshwp1p	1	*	This is a guy that doesn't know the meaning of humility.  Above all else, the reason he won't admit to it is because it would mean he wasn't responsible for his own success. 
t1_dsho58x	0	*	They don't even have fake elections in North Korea, it's already established that Kim Jong Un's going to rule the country till he dies 
t1_dshew5y	0	*	Trump got just elected a year ago, you comment confuses me.
t1_dshs3p8	1	*	aaaannnnnddddd he's dead.
t1_dshs5j9	1	*	BE GONE VILE MAN, BE GONE! 
t1_dshs88q	1	*	Yeah, those assholes lock up almost as many of their own people as the U.S. government.  Don't they have any standards of decency at all?
t1_dshh18d	1	*	[Quite so.](https://img.timeinc.net/time/magazine/archive/covers/1996/1101960715_400.jpg)

t1_dsiy9y8	0	*	I honestly thought the Russians would have pushed to put in another Zuma instead of Cyril coming in. 
t1_dsi7go3	1	*	I don't even want to see a report to trust on this
t1_dshwkze	1	*	remember to fuck off today!
t1_dsi3i6x	1	*	What if no one actually likes Russia, so Russia started going around spreading rumors that they totally made out with another country to get you to hate that country? 
t1_dsav74v	0	*	No idea dude, it's all backwards, in the course of protecting people from words, we are taking the world more backwards than ever before.
t1_dsb7bkb	1	*	Guess it's easier to repost the same comment over & over than to actually read what the person said. Lol.
t1_dsarqgz	0	*	Bullshit.
t1_dsbv5jh	1	*	I think we need certain restrictions to make sure ex-criminals don't work with children and such (for certain crimes) but I see your point.
t1_dsb37j3	0	*	How do you 'prove it' without a conviction? 
t1_duk916l	1	*	Rumor has it that some of those scripts are created by those working directly for Vladimir Putin.
t1_dv2hhlk	1	*	This is happening because shareholder value is more important than our democracy.
t1_duv24gw	0	*	I just wanted to offer a more nuanced opinion. If youd rather make snide remarks than discuss the merit of what Ive said, youre not somebody Id like to talk to anyway.
t1_dsxogt9	0	*	The Mens Rights movement is just a cover for misogyny.   Mike Pence is afraid of being alone with women because hes fucking creep.

t1_dsacdwa	0	*	>getting S-400 after NATO denied our request  I am a big fan of the S-400 Triumf but as far as reasons to not join an economic union go, that one is fairly petty. 
t1_dsafxhz	1	*	But aren't Gulf Arabs disliked even by other Arabs?   Turks dislike Arabs for being too conservative and religious and also because of refugees, why do Arabs dislike Turks, then?
t1_ds9so7o	1	*	Moldova is further west than Ukraine. It is firmly within Europe. They speak Romanian, a European language, and are on the European peninsula.
t1_dsawc8w	1	*	The French hate their politicians with passion. 28% approval is very, very high. 
t1_ds9rglv	1	*	Having a big army would solve one of the problems you complain about: unnecessary expenditure. Is all about rationalization
t1_ds9t906	1	*	They invaded Cyprus to stop the killing of Turks there. They should have left right after, but the invasion was somewhat legit.
t1_ds947ij	1	*	He just doesn't care if anyone else cares about the way he cares.

t1_dsud7co	1	*	Agreed
t1_dsueism	1	*	Because racism /s
t1_dssz2u7	1	*	Oh boy, I don't have a link to summarize that. But on Sufis in Pakistan this article may help you understand situation better - https://www.dawn.com/news/759390
t1_dssat1g	0	*	I feel like that is the biggest part of it all. Doing whatever is necessary to prevent future generations from buying into the same radicalization. 
t1_dssbaqz	0	*	Look Holland just needs to revert to Spanish control. The EU can swap it for Catalonia right?  /s
t1_dsrskxl	1	*	But surely this time it will work.
t1_dsv0f8i	1	*	You tell me :)
t1_dsrh8u6	1	*	Anti-Islamic wink wink. 
t1_dsscegf	1	*	What even is that second paragraph?
t1_dstxj41	1	*	How did you come to that conclusion?
t1_dssfxqd	0	*	Is killing nonbelievers, heretics, blasphemers, and apostates mentioned?  Old testament tells us to kill witches and all. We stopped that though 
t1_dssbl76	1	*	Well said. 
t1_dss9qf0	0	*	>The people carrying out the attacks really don't have much understanding of Islam at all.  So what is your understanding of Islam?
t1_dssb2m2	1	*	It does not look like that at all...
t1_dstl20i	1	*	Of course that kind of schism does occur in Islam as well. That's a constant in every religion.  Heck even Buddhists do have their extremist.
t1_dssdrkc	1	*	I don't know, who needs religion? 
t1_dtceefz	0	*	What is the joke exactly?     You are pretending to be a neonazi white supremacist alt-right wackjob?      You are parroting your president's words.        
t1_dtclqhz	0	*	Sure. What does that have to do with Russia though?
t1_du7hqtl	1	*	Oh it is, 100%.
t1_du73s74	0	*	Turns out Futurama was actually set in the year 2017.
t1_du7m984	1	*	Heck yeah, hopefully replacement bones are cheap by the time I turn 70
t1_du75cxm	0	*	Just don't forget to go get it.
t1_du6s0nc	1	*	But it laid many of the foundations of modern society.
t1_dt8gbq9	0	*	So it's a competition between builders and the demolition crew? What's the prize? 
t1_dt85om2	0	*	All your sources point to Falun Gong's publication. Worth less than the paper they are printed on.
t1_dt8fjhj	1	*	Right. They're a gateway to a lot of markets for drug runners.
t1_dsntesr	1	*	Making China great again
t1_dsn4vuj	0	*	> You know what to expect from China.  Mass censorship and murdering of their own citizens? Yeah we know what to expect.
t1_dsnq1oh	1	*	Do they not? The people chose to elect them, they could elect someone else.
t1_dsniay0	1	*	No, but you can make an empty allegation for it.
t1_dsn583l	0	*	Why/how would Kim Jong Un be in Seoul by the morning?
t1_dukdlix	0	*	I'm asking if you are a fan of how she does not like gays and muslims. 
t1_dujm4f4	1	*	while this doesnt really answer your question, taxonomically they're closer to humans (and everyone other animal) than they are plants
t1_dslmw92	0	*	He's only going to be your president for 7 more years. Resist, resist your little heart out. 
t1_duch0tm	0	*	January 5, 2011 is when you joined reddit. 
t1_dtxdmo7	1	*	You mean having your parents, aunts, uncle, and boss at work following you isnt cool? U0001f626
t1_dtxoetq	0	*	Instagram is owned by Facebook, it's pretty much just an extension of it at this point. Go ask kids what they think about Instagram.  You know. Just humor me.
t1_du4dbyo	0	*	How can it be accessed? Anyways he looks guilty enough. Years old account with 722 karma but just one comment with 40.
t1_du3x8ke	1	*	Puerto Rico doesn't have a mayer. The head of the Puerto Rican government is the [Governor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governor_of_Puerto_Rico).
t1_du4b0zj	0	*	Remember when people were yelling about water quality for two months?   The numbers they were citing were front a 2015 EPA report when Puerto Rico voted to ignore water quality regulations.  
t1_du4g2xq	1	*	Nobody gets too far like that. This kind of dance can never la~aast. 
t1_du485h5	1	*	Drivers in Puerto Rico are not that great in some senses... at least by my standards. Only know becuase I have been here for about a month for a work project.  
t1_du48j3c	1	*	He sent some for hospitals and stuff 
t1_du4bgz7	1	*	Nop i checked all. Electricity must be cheap over there
t1_du44jca	1	*	#WHY YOU LITTLE
t1_du45cci	1	*	ONE STEP FORWARD  ONE STEP FORWARD  ONE STEP FORWARD   AND SIX STEPS BACK  AND SIX STEPS BACK
t1_du3xdw6	1	*	>mayer (sic)  You know Puerto Rico isnt a city, right?
t1_du4aidi	1	*	The blame is with PR and no one else. They have refused help from the us govt because they want autonomy over their electrical grid.   Funny how facts get in the way of your hatred 
t1_du4g7y8	1	*	Well it's been months sooo....
t1_du44i9i	0	*	Well last 2 Referendums we voted both were for becoming a state. Last one had a big boycott because they were tired of the vote meaning nothing. 
t1_du61ddh	1	*	I will definitely look into that, thank you.
t1_du4czby	1	*	Those darn nature explosions sure are a nuisance!
t1_du47z14	1	*	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Step_Forward
t1_du4cwxq	1	*	No one even mentioned Trump. PR was treated as a colony under Obama as well.  
t1_du45i0d	1	*	Which takes a lot of time. The work is already being done it's just not finished yet.
t1_du4ctb9	1	*	Sounds like you need a wanksy copycat.
t1_du4fakl	0	*	> It does?!  It does.  Your country made them territory and citizens.
t1_du459q0	1	*	Puerto Ricans need to swallow their pride and vote on statehood. 
t1_du452t2	0	*	The administration is doing everything it can.  Puerto Ricos recovery literally cant happen any faster than it is.  Power is actually expected to be back on ahead of schedule.  
t1_du46msn	1	*	PR isn't like the rest of the U.S. The culture and mindset in politics is much more like the Dominican Republic or Haiti than Texas.
t1_du4uvfr	1	*	Sounds like a job for the Boring company.
t1_dtt347z	1	*	This needs Oprah for it to work!
t1_dtsq1rm	0	*	The paper would still be as thick as a concerete wall
t1_dumr4g8	1	*	I am confident that *real people* actually believe this.  I am not convinced that collosoll is a bot, just a collosoll asswipe.
t1_dumrvcw	1	*	You guy are like a soap opera. I don't even follow my country's affair as I do yours. 
t1_dumtkj3	1	*	If the 2nd Amendment crowd on Reddit is representative of the group think IRL, there will a war before that happens, & it will be everybody else's fault.
t1_dumtit8	1	*	With a gun. Not everyone is john wick, life isnt like the movies, and every shot isn't a kill shot.   Got a scar in my abdomen that proves it.  
t1_du305n2	0	*	I like how you kind of just ignored the reply entirely and restated yourself.
t1_du47zk3	1	*	> helps swing political parties to campaign to capture the centrist vote  I think preferential voting does the heavy lifting on that front.
t1_du2x84g	1	*	He also dared to donate money to George W. Bush's opposition! The nerve to against the President that brought us the Iraq war!
t1_du3w0xb	1	*	Makes it all a bit less nefarious, yes. 
t1_du2yw6i	1	*	Russian billionaires donate money to politicians in every western country. And no, it's not called an act of war.
t1_dufnbmt	1	*	How?
t1_du3731j	1	*	Yup.
t1_du37sib	0	*	Didn't a bunch of American billionaires indirectly finance Brexit?I never saw anyone complain about that.   I only see people upset with money in politics when it's left wing groups getting money.
t1_du3k5vt	1	*	It looks like a market liberal and pro democracy foundation. 
t1_du341ez	1	*	Yet Robert Mercer (a US businessman) and Arron Banks can give the biggest donations in British political history to a pro-Brexit propaganda campaign and not a word is said, how amusing.
t1_dsaksv8	1	*	Does it get tiring? All the cognitive dissonance, I mean. 
t1_dsapfju	0	*	2 have pled guilty, 2 indictments.
t1_dsbsmey	1	*	Then shell be pardoned by Trump along with anyone else he cares about and well have a constitutional crisis. 
t1_dsabc8v	0	*	Lied about greeting someone?  Lol  That's all you've got? Where is the quid pro quo felony collision that Mueller is supposedly looking for? 
t1_dsaf7ga	0	*	dumbass, shithead president ==>  who can take your posts seriously? Just say'in.  Asking for a friend. 
t1_dsamvos	1	*	You're a clown. You have any idea how a case is built? No you don't.
t1_dsb1cif	0	*	Lying to the FBI is not a crime?
t1_dsapz1f	0	*	Who is in the WH? Someone important? Maybe if we start pretending it doesn't exist, it will implode in psychotic rage. 
t1_dsba1nb	1	*	I think we know what he wants his adversaries to know. 
t1_dsbi86l	1	*	Exactly.
t1_dsaw3hp	1	*	If she didnt remember saying hi to someone in an elevator... yeah lets cut that lying bitchs head off.
t1_dsbueav	1	*	So if you commit a murder....but don't mean to do so....you should not be prosecuted? 
t1_dsazgc5	1	*	Then stop after the first time.
t1_dsat07n	0	*	Remember how many times Jr.'s story changed? I highly doubt they just randomly ended up in an elevator and exchanged hellos. 
t1_dsabh1g	0	*	Are from you the party of science?
t1_dsaexxe	0	*	Yeah I mean inditiments..... are nothing....
t1_dsbauh3	0	*	Just watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VWxkauh6lyA 
t1_dtt8scx	1	*	Well the message has been diluted, but it was worth it
t1_dsr1tu3	0	*	Periodically shredded comment.
t1_dsmqadh	0	*	>We account for 100% of security, peace, and entertainment too.  Why stop at 100% bro? These days I get 150% of my entertainment from you guys!! 
t1_duhvl8m	0	*	um. wrong.
t1_duj3ff5	0	*	Since when did you have to be an expert on Hungary to understand people's political leanings?  You're an idiot.
t1_duhx5ce	1	*	Incorrect.
t1_duhwmxc	1	*	Do you want the Tenth Crusade? Because this is how you get the Tenth Crusade.
t1_duhluzf	0	*	Nothing good ever came from increasing the amount of people who demonstrably prone to irrational thinking. 
t1_dui7gxc	1	*	It has more to do with open-mindedness and understanding of archetypes than IQ, although having a higher IQ doesn't hurt (it certainly doesn't *help* to have a low one).
t1_dui6kba	1	*	Opinions of different groups should not be based off of their extremist factions.  Its all grey.
t1_duhhk4g	1	*	You've got to let him try though! He shows how devout a Christian is by trying to completely disrespect another religion, shows how much he values Jesus' teachings.
t1_duhl9b1	1	*	>European values = Judeo-Christian foundations though.  More like rebranded neoplatonism.
t1_duhm1od	0	*	I would say that the fruits of fundamentalism are different depending on the religion. 
t1_duhk3ki	1	*	> European Values you mean tolerance and lack of values  If by values you mean lack of values  Geez, even for a troll account that's low effort.
t1_duhy8d7	0	*	Just because their parents are religious doesn't mean the children will be religious. In Europe you'll see tons of young muslims drink, not pray, not fast, have premarital sex etc.
t1_ds5l5xb	1	*	It takes what ... 2 or 3 seconds to realize government sponsored bombings of civillian apartment buildings isn't the same as one town enacting a midnight curfew? 
t1_ds4tfwg	1	*	Even though it was our government that put that theocracy in power 
t1_ds5mdhl	0	*	What a useless comment.
t1_ds4w9b0	1	*	Not just US either, I personally talked to RT reporters at Occupy London.
t1_ds4qqg9	0	*	do you even understand the fucking topic?
t1_ds4m1d2	1	*	U0001f643 can still use it if it's upside down U0001f643
t1_ds4r97e	0	*	That entire riot was a mess though. I agree with you on the issues behind it but the Ferguson riots made it  harder to get people behind protests of more illegal police shootings. 
t1_ds4ru6f	0	*	This is of course the same argument both regimes uses. 
t1_ds4yum6	0	*	They tried so hard but ultimately the car still hit the wall. Which is a shame because they really had the best intentions back when they wrote the constitution. 
t1_ds58i58	1	*	Who ret da tanks out? Roof! Roof! Roof!
t1_ds5seum	0	*	Whataboutism is a term used to attempt to derail valid comparison. There is no such thing as whataboutism.
t1_ds4pygv	1	*	Im afraid Putin would remain unbeaten then.
t1_ds4yi3w	1	*	That's mostly because the people doing that were likely plain clothed cops trying to create reasons to crack down.  They were caught in the act more than once during all of that.
t1_ds4sss1	1	*	Where does this leave Snowden?
t1_ds4rmcr	0	*	So what does Stalin have to do with Russia nowadays? Do you still resent Germany?  Do you still not see my point?
t1_ds4pcc9	0	*	Who in the media said Ferguson was a riot? lol
t1_ds517e1	1	*	Yes but protestors doing bad things to themselves or others is different from the govt shutting down and killing protestors 
t1_ds4yr7w	1	*	I had to walk past camps near where I worked at the time and it wasn't bad at all. A bunch of normal looking people just fighting for their beliefs
t1_ds4t0x9	1	*	And it wasn't?
t1_ds55j2f	0	*	No, I meant Russia is an asshole.  Not you :) 
t1_ds561pt	1	*	reddit trying to justify looting and rioting. hilarious. 
t1_ds5lgfb	1	*	strongly area
t1_ds4pfu2	0	*	I mean, good. The entire country rising up like this is the only chance they have.
t1_ds4vx7y	0	*	oh yes, when america does it, it's an accident, but when a US enemy does it then it's part of their 1000 step evil plan to take over the world
t1_ds4oq3s	1	*	How many people do cops murder over there?
t1_ds4vhr3	1	*	As is tradition
t1_ds4to6k	1	*	So... 1 death from an unknown shooter, despite a hail of bullets  1 death from a self inflicted gunshot  1 death from overdose  Sounds like a regular Tienanmen Square murder spree!
t1_ds4oesd	1	*	When it comes to the Middle East, it basically all ends with our women wear short shorts and yours don't.
t1_ds53v4s	1	*	Iran is a literal theocracy. 
t1_ds4xop5	1	*	All that was left there were bums. 
t1_ds56jl5	0	*	Because the first amendment guarantees their right to exist in the US as a TV channel. You might dislike them, which can be understandable, but banning them would be a violation of the first amendment
t1_ds4rnai	0	*	...did you read my post or did you just really want to spout off with some outrage?  Americans are given freedom to assemble and to change the government. The same is not true in Iran.
t1_ds4rcor	0	*	We did the same to **reporters** and protesters at the Keystone Pipeline protests.
t1_ds4pe2s	0	*	by those standards every country in the world is a huge hypocrite 
t1_ds5c8z4	0	*	People will stop calling it out for what it is when people stop using it.
t1_ds50ot9	0	*	Yeah I don't think crushed is the right word here
t1_ds4obgl	1	*	The time for peace ended in 2009. I think both the mullahs and the protesters know this.
t1_ds4p7qs	1	*	Agreed, OWS eventually just became where all the homeless druggies and rapists gathered towards the end.
t1_ds4pofe	0	*	It is possible for both actions to be wrong you know.
t1_ds4rmpb	0	*	But they spread it out over the whole year instead of just at protests, so it's more okay.
t1_ds4ulrk	0	*	This would be true if they werent also proposing the exact same solutions
t1_ds77ofg	1	*	Pedantic.
t1_ds4tupz	0	*	Sure.  https://www.hoover.org/research/russias-new-and-frightening-ism
t1_ds4p16h	1	*	lmao are you saying reddit doesn't criticize the USA  pretty much every political thread turns into a 'fuck the usa' thread at least *somewhere* in the comments
t1_ds4uggw	0	*	It is exceedingly rare, though, really. We just hear about it every. time. 
t1_ds4zlai	1	*	This is succinct  
t1_ds4rf8s	0	*	Sounds like you approve of everything that went down in Ferguson.
t1_ds4r1n5	0	*	Im sorry, is this a bad Star Wars movie?
t1_ds4qtxv	1	*	Boston Massacre /s

t1_ds5d6g0	1	*	https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/5686601
t1_ds50bwd	0	*	>  They want to lower the moral standard for everyone because Russia will gain the most from that.   I don't think US has the moral high ground over Russia though.
t1_ds6y9t4	1	*	You could ask that very question a lot of past US presidents mate. The answer is, it doesn't. Ever.
t1_ds55glr	0	*	So why are Americans criticizing Iranian police for firing at protestors?
t1_ds52kej	0	*	30 fuckin years of whataboutism is all you guys even have anymore
t1_ds52tew	1	*	Right, so what does that look like, in 2017? 
t1_ds4pzfp	0	*	And Russia is not USSR. And Stalin was Georgian. So my deflection is perfect.
t1_ds52pu7	1	*	Youre all Russians ...
t1_ds6xzb4	1	*	>What would you rather they do?  Get the fuck out and bust them later and put them in front of a court? 
t1_ds4t6bn	1	*	I'm thinking that you missed the 0.1% joke in there...
t1_ds4q7xl	0	*	The guy that.. Didn't die? 
t1_ds560ti	1	*	Reddit if you count bots 
t1_ds4zsdr	1	*	Thanks for letting me know. Copy-pasting on my phone is... frustrating to say the least.
t1_ds4zyv9	1	*	I am trapped in the machine. Let me out.
t1_ds4rx6b	1	*	Technically, your post is whataboutism as well.  What about that time you used whataboutism?  Not that I disagree, I just thought it was hilarious irony.
t1_ds4q5qp	0	*	 It's not about what happened after. My point is that the police tried to crush the protest. 
t1_ds4yng7	1	*	In Soviet Russia...
t1_ds50i41	1	*	Yup fixed it, ty!
t1_ds5e0tp	1	*	And its working too
t1_ds4rhkz	1	*	Yeah,the stl police functioned like the mafia there

t1_ds4vc6s	0	*	Incorrect, Trayvon was shot in Florida
t1_ds53ng7	1	*	Wait a minute... youre saying its okay to put people in reservations based on ethnicity? Hmmm 
t1_ds5snaa	1	*	U3 is at 4.1%, and people don't pay attention to U6 because it follows  lockstep. The cpi is decent, and water is fine.
t1_ds54fgp	1	*	Kremcoin, invest now. TO THE MOON! 
t1_ds54var	1	*	No, youre wrong. The United States is basically a dictatorship and its people are routinely rounded up and put into camps if not outright killed. Were worse than NK, so says Reddit. 
t1_ds4rdwb	1	*	The same could be said of Iran tho

t1_dujfr31	1	*	Assuming that he did something worth jailing him for. I'm open to the possibility he didn't. I just doubt it.
t1_duk1ek4	1	*	...which he then doesn't pay for.
t1_dul0ei1	1	*	know you are right on the point at exactly whatever borders are in this context.
t1_dujz1yl	1	*	You're right! Let's open a special counsel investigation into the crime of... not clapping for the President. That'll give those Democrats what they deserve.
t1_dujkcx7	0	*	Commit treason or indict Trump for it? I'm not understanding your little suggestion here.
t1_dv4uali	0	*	Capitalism has bought and paid for our Democracy! 
t1_dtmt0zu	0	*	No, I get it. After hearing people like that speak it makes me think they have a really annoying face too but I think thats just how our tribalist monkey brains work
t1_duyss53	1	*	Not on their own, sure, but they're not on their own here. They're working with the ruling party.
t1_duypvri	0	*	it is like super heroine. Comparable effects to normal heroine, and visually identical - but a dose smaller than a grain of rice will kill a healthy adult
t1_dux71fj	1	*	This doesn't count as whataboutism since alcohol *is* a kind of drug therefore it's very topical and relevant.
t1_duyv813	0	*	It was 1P, which gets broken down into regular form once ingested. You could order them straight from labs!
t1_duwxznd	0	*	He's talking about kids doing drugs (for *medical* reasons). In other words just more FUD and fear-mongering.
t1_duxkwzz	1	*	Its actually a shame that there is no choice on the 'right'. The Conservatives' logic (or lack of) is so scary, that it makes them a non-option for many.
t1_duxnck0	0	*	The original objective of legalizing cannabis is to *legalize cannabis*. So ... I'd say they're pretty on-track to getting that done.

t1_dtx5vq0	0	*	How common do you imagine your situation to be? It sounds like this proposal was written just for you. Hell it sounds like it was written BY you.

t1_dtxmzve	1	*	We haven't left yet. I don't have high hopes that  the plans will change, but I have tiny hopes. Would certainly be better for the UK if Brexit is called off!
t1_dtxesa7	0	*	I'm a Brit who has lived in Aus for two years and the cost of living is much better than UK. New Zealand has less opportunities, lower pay and higher cost of living. 
t1_dtxk28j	0	*	Irish in the UK are treated as non-foreigners and visa versa British in Ireland.

t1_dtxfi1z	1	*	Why would they want to leave?
t1_dtxf55q	0	*	That's just the press. More people die here from drowning than spider bites, and we are taught to swin while still in nappies.

t1_dtyhcpw	1	*	That's why the hybridization would make them so powerful!!!

t1_dtx918l	1	*	Classic Newy
t1_dtxjo6f	1	*	True that.  If xa31500 was the only barrier to moving there from the UK I'd have gone years ago :(

t1_dtxddr2	0	*	Wait, are you Mexico?
t1_dtxqeue	1	*	They already can if they want to, with the working holiday visa. That's how 3/4 of Australians in that age range fulfill their mandatory overseas year long mountain retreat

t1_dtxf7ln	1	*	needs to die quicker
t1_dtxfmys	1	*	I think shared cultural history is a euphemism for colonisersand this needs to be considered in the context of that.
t1_dtxnu1s	0	*	It can't happen in Canada (or in other Westminster system countries) because the failure of a budget bill defeats the government, typically triggering new elections.
t1_dtxcaos	1	*	Pretty much the same in the UK mate. If I lived alone I wouldn't be able to afford the rent and my car. 
t1_dtxdieu	0	*	Most people don't have a problem with Poles or Indians, they have an issue with immigrants from Muslim majority countries.

t1_dtyj7v9	1	*	True, I don't really know what the Canadian perception of this is. But 65 million vs New Zealand's 4.5 million is quite a difference.

t1_dtyefra	1	*	They prefer the term Kiwis
t1_dtxd30h	0	*	Lol. For me its cold in winter if the temperature is below 15C. It hit 4C last winter one night and i was freezing even under my doona!
t1_ds4z4yk	1	*	They also disliked arabs enough to offer them a small problem to deal with. 
t1_dtd0jvn	0	*	have you checked if there is a slider or wheel or something under the weightplate? I had an old weighing machine (Not sure from where), that had a wheel you could turn to tune the dial.

t1_dswt9gp	0	*	Rape is a violation of bodily autonomy, and thus pregnancy resulting from it is too. But, imo, the same argument can't be made about consensual sex.
t1_dsx0sws	0	*	> because it's almost always true.   And people almost always forget that, so it's good to remind them.
t1_dsx5ukr	1	*	If It's right because it's the law was true, there would be no need for activism. Truth and the common good make the law, not the other way around.
t1_dswq63j	0	*	Yeah, no. 16 weeks before it's really anything other than cells. Four months.
t1_dswn7k8	0	*	I hope one day you'll be mature enough to see the value in treating people fairly, even if you don't like them. 
t1_dsx4dkp	0	*	Canada isn't the U.S. Elected officials do not have the power to change The Charter. 
t1_dswvp5c	0	*	He is only denying funding because they are religious group. You know, like in every fucking civilised country where State and Church are separate. 
t1_dswklyv	1	*	Which is why the movement is usually termed pro-life, and not anti-abortion.
t1_dswyula	0	*	Abortion aren't done at 5 months. 
t1_dswnotw	1	*	And either way Im not the fucking President.
t1_dsws48j	1	*	Good News!  We now have a triple big mac.  Bad News!  You're officially middle aged when you get you bachelor's, and you have to be a Methuselah to see Social Security.

t1_dswr50o	0	*	Repeat, Canada is NOT a home to right wing agendas
t1_dsx0zl1	0	*	If its okay for the right to block abortion funding then its okay for the left to block anti-abortion funding. Cant have it both ways
t1_dswohm6	1	*	I'm a Catholic and am pro choice, but this is  discriminatory.
t1_dsx0iku	0	*	I've never quite understood the women's rights angle of the pro-choice argument, mostly because it doesn't address the single concern of pro-lifers which is you're killing a person.
t1_dsx1wj7	0	*	Let's pretend for a moment that there were 60 million abortions performed.  Wouldn't better sex education and birth control (Hello? Planned Parenthood?) funding make more sense? Sigh.... 
t1_dswpfwc	0	*	It's funding for student jobs. This isn't something everyone has a right to. 
t1_dswmo3z	1	*	An influx of conservative, religious immigrants may change that.
t1_dswjpmk	0	*	It cuts both ways though. There are also moderates who waiver between voting liberal or conservative who are turned off by this policy. 
t1_dswmmvc	1	*	It's almost like you didn't even look into the issue and just decided to comment on it. color me shocked, SHOCKED.
t1_dswpdx0	1	*	Religious groups aren't really involved here. This isn't targeted at religious groups. And not all anti abortion groups are affiliated with religious groups. 
t1_dswocmc	1	*	It's a very competitive environment I see.
t1_dswpcgn	0	*	Thats funny, so is my Christian Minecraft server
t1_dsxoccl	1	*	He wouldnt.  She is pants on head retarded(but we already knew that from being at fox)  But right is right, even if it doesn't matter. 
t1_dsx0dr0	1	*	Yeah non-Americans love talking shit on America at any opportunity 
t1_dswmde5	0	*	It helps these young adults pay for their university tuition. Educating youth is a long term preventive measure. 
t1_dsxixlk	1	*	Yeah, and there was quite a lot of vote splitting between the NDP and the Liberals, and I'm pretty sure the people who voted for either of those parties have fairly similar views on social issues 
t1_dsx14m7	0	*	Because a government and its policies should come from the people rather than the government encoding and brainwashing its ideals on its people. 
t1_dsxdro6	1	*	There's a difference between actively murdering another human being versus letting a human die from inaction, especially from a moral perspective. 
t1_dsx2iiq	0	*	Same concept. Attack whatever doesn't fit your bullshit religious dogma. On the left side, we attack whatever attacks the woman. 
t1_dsx3eh4	0	*	Why would that be fair? Abortion is legal in Canada so the government has no issue with it.
t1_dswr72n	0	*	Took me 5 days to see a cardiologist   /shrug
t1_dswq7ij	1	*	_North_ America I guess?
t1_dswpanw	1	*	Probably because they are desperate for anybody.
t1_dswsabh	1	*	Canada is part of America, not the USA. We are the United States of America, other countries call us the states because Canada and Mexico are America too. 
t1_dswvbjq	0	*	I'm not.
t1_dswzjbb	1	*	> practice our ideology or we won't give you any money   oh wow so brave 
t1_dswrtfy	0	*	Nice straw man. Are you against morning after pills too?
t1_dswscd4	1	*	Exactly, and most people open their mouth way too early.  Its a medical decision, and just like other medical decisions, it should be argued and decided upon by trained doctors and researchers.    
t1_dsxhz9o	0	*	Americans who pretend to be Canadian aren't Americans.
t1_dswzjig	0	*	A guy who says honor killings aren't barbaric is in no way in touch with mainstream America. Neither are you it seems.
t1_dsxh339	1	*	It's not an endorsement, to respect them means to not infringe upon them. 
t1_dswmj6d	0	*	> The abortion debate is settled in Canada.  It will never be settled. There will always be people who value life, just like there are people who oppose racism. 
t1_dswwm5t	1	*	What if I told you you are, and you have no say in the matter?
t1_dswlpp0	1	*	I am pro choice but you're completely missing the point being made. 
t1_dswqoku	0	*	Yeah that's what I'm getting at. Social welfare isn't enough... 
t1_dsy3rl2	1	*	Congrats on being an anti science sick person 
t1_dswrsaz	0	*	We both know that's not what the large majority of people mean when they say America.

t1_dswq0jy	1	*	Blades of grass have unique dna
t1_dswpfpx	0	*	The other side of the argument actively hurts (and kills) the child, which is where the core issue is, from a pro-life perspective.   
t1_dswt55l	1	*	This is Fox and Friends, they don't research shit.
t1_dswvcmz	1	*	Not yet
t1_dswnqjf	1	*	This is the best I've seen this concept explained. I'm saving this. Thank you. 
t1_dswlz8h	1	*	Why shouldn't men get a say just because it can't happen to them? Men's tax dollars pay for half of abortions, if they get no say they shouldn't have to pay.
t1_dswqqfk	1	*	Absolutely. I'm renting a single bedroom with my partner in Victoria and we are struggling. 
t1_dsx38yl	0	*	Most important to me: Did not want to offend you personally.    Yes: The start of the USA is most impressive and the development and the way to freedom of the european(british) suppression impressive.
t1_dswqhca	1	*	lmao   Abortion is not a right imo
t1_dswv7dw	1	*	Oh okay gotcha. It's totally philosophy vs philosophy.   It's fun how intelligence makes us painfully aware of how dumb we still are as a species. 
t1_dsws2xg	1	*	What's the exchange rate on that like?
t1_dswlchc	0	*	Calling a fetus a cluster of genetic material is like calling a house a cluster of wood.
t1_dswl0of	1	*	Do you think fetuses are legally considered human beings? That's pretty ignorant.
t1_dsxcsql	0	*	Really? I suggest you read on what abortion has brought around the world since it's legalization and come back to me when you're done.
t1_dswnaph	0	*	> counter to the constitution and it's protected classes.  Its. It's means it is.

t1_dswpebl	0	*	Yep and if men had to have give birth there would be an abortion clinic on almost every corner. 
t1_dsxd2xk	0	*	Canadian. And Liberal. I'm just self aware enough to see unfair treatment regardless of my political stances. 
t1_dsxcgzq	1	*	Well... do you think you deserve a break? ;)
t1_dswrfey	1	*	ahh and they've everyone successfully mind-tangled.
t1_dswni9v	1	*	If it helps some Redditors on the Christian right get over it, many muslim groups are also anti-abortion .
t1_dswnzs9	1	*	Experienced alter boys have value.
t1_dswre9e	1	*	Its also in the law that woman have the right to choose.
t1_dsx0nt6	0	*	Whatever you got to tell yourself
t1_dswjiys	1	*	A women's right to murder?
t1_dswpclh	0	*	Because that's the whole point of *free speech*?  Hate groups in the U.S. have free speech, so long as they don't incite a riot, directly cause violence, or some other small exceptions.
t1_dswomnv	0	*	Isnt everything? Reddit and pretty much all social media sites facilitate making matters black and white.
t1_dswmq0k	1	*	This is a copy and paste right? 
t1_dswpwvj	0	*	Its not a right because it was never determined to be a right. Its always been a highly contested issue.   Its legal to get an abortion but you do not have the right to an abortion. 
t1_dswqi3u	0	*	Aye aye captain
t1_dswtk5a	1	*	>The Democratic and Republican Parties and their organizations have no such power to prevent undesirable individuals from running in and winning   Too bad.  
t1_dt05ivi	1	*	Hmm...fair point. Though I haven't come across anyone yet to be offended by my use of the states, the more common reaction is one of appreciation.
t1_dt0d66h	0	*	The person that suffers when bigots and assholes FORCE her to become a depressed mother is the woman (and the unwanted child).  The world is a worse place because of pro-life bigotry.
t1_dswl4v2	1	*	Should these guys get funding too?  Or do you just want people to get paid for believing in your god?    https://thesatanictemple.com/
t1_dswpfzv	0	*	According to Canada, you do not support human rights. Support abortion or the government will deny you support.
t1_dswl1ik	1	*	There's literally no difference between denying taxpayer dollars to people that want to deny others of their rights, and discriminating against others.
t1_dsx8sj3	1	*	No one is being banned, they just can't get free money.
t1_dswni5t	0	*	Oh hi again lol, I think you misunderstood, I don't want religious groups pushing ideologies to get funding.
t1_dsx0c41	0	*	When male society dictates that women cannot have sex without having their bodily autonomy breached in a way men do not, that is discrimination.
t1_dswvbwy	1	*	Not every ideology is equal and not every opinion need be taken seriously.
t1_dsxsc1k	1	*	It's all so tiresome.
t1_dsx6cxs	0	*	Not as many as she does.  Tell me, why would a woman have a late-term abortion?
t1_dsx0jdd	0	*	So you should be fine with this decision since an elected official enacted policies that the people voted him in for.
t1_dswnysr	1	*	>No human being has the right to live at the expense of another human being.  You just made a great pro-life argument.

t1_dsx1mqu	0	*	I hope you dont support the military or the entirety of any religion.
t1_dsxbcpm	1	*	Because the TFW program made damn sure that teens can't get jobs in fast food cause they're more expensive than importing labor from out of Canada.
t1_dswr752	0	*	It's a lot less messy when they use a vacuum.
t1_dswkb7a	1	*	There a group of democrats who want to exclude *pro life* democrats but is there really much of a debate? Party leaders such as  Nancy Pelosi said of course you can be a democrat and pro  life

t1_dswpsxg	1	*	I know you are joking but,  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_time and it is a far better system than our current timekeeping. 
t1_dsxjaw5	1	*	Trudeau's thing doesn't ask if they want to legislate. It asks if they agree.
t1_dsxc1to	1	*	and there is nothing wrong in your head to 1) pick head of states based on their attractiveness and 2) wanting a baby from a stranger who is married?
t1_dswri53	1	*	lol, staff sergeant queef.
t1_dv1a89y	0	*	You are comparing cotton to latex.
t1_dtd0ybp	0	*	There would be people from the other side claiming illegalities if Hillary would have won. All I have to say is: prove it.
t1_dtcwlaq	1	*	Its like you setting up a superbowl party and inviting nothing but die-hard fans from each team to one a bar. You stay home and read on the news that 4 people got stabbed and one got killed. 
t1_dtd3e6c	0	*	60,000 people said they would go to an event, which means that the event appeared on all of their friends' timelines as well. It's a lot more than 60,000 people who saw it

t1_dtpnl2i	0	*	You don't know what you are talking about. There is a Russian military base in Moldova, they still have strong relations.

t1_dtq1n40	0	*	Poor people tend to have less time to cook because they must work more to survive. Double shifts, two jobs, overtime, etc
t1_dtoevpd	0	*	Fair enough, I was thinking of people who create foods or drinks using different flavors etc.  Little more science behind what you described. 
t1_dtpfjku	1	*	> most people don't tie their self worth and masculinity to dietary habits...  Fair enough, but vegetarianism is a bit like ice cream in that only people 'who swing *that* way' go for it.
t1_dtp0o9p	1	*	Im sure all countries that have been affected by globalization will complain, Europe is very different when it comes to portions, taste and quality of food.

t1_ds6ozi4	1	*	this is exactly how i feel as well
t1_ds6bqs6	1	*	It is unlikely that India would participate in a war against Russia. In such a situation, it would be sitting on the fence.

t1_ds6u7ul	1	*	Can't*
t1_ds7f7q6	1	*	People don't want him to succeed because of what he's attempting to do. I'd love for everything he attempted failed. 4 years of him failing would be a lot better for the country in the long run. 
t1_ds6cill	1	*	Is Trump fair with CNN, MSNBC and CBS ? I don't think so. He's full of hate and despise. On the contrary they keep treating him much more fairly than he's treating them.

t1_ds6whuy	1	*	If you haven't as yet, read *Win Bigly: Persuasion in a world where facts don't matter* by Scott Adams.   He touches on a lot of the points you make. I think you may enjoy it. 
t1_ds6gz45	1	*	Pakistan has nuclear weapons. The USA does not attack countries that have those. 
t1_ds6oz0l	1	*	But on what fronts is he trying to be successful? Its all right wing policies like tax cuts for wealthy people and taking health care from those on Medicaid and Obamacare. 
t1_ds6rivg	0	*	India doesnt share a border with Afghanistan, its much harder to buy their government and during the cold war years India sided with Russia.
t1_ds6n9bt	1	*	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_Air_Flight_655  shooting down a passenger airliner is pretty terrorists to me. 
t1_ds6c4zk	1	*	Troll copypastas can go fuck themselves.

t1_duzz072	0	*	This article is about the UK. And every country has gang issues. It's not something that is easily removed.
t1_dv0h90d	1	*	Since we introduced guns acid attacks have drop by 400% this year! Yes our gun crime has gone up 400% but no maor acid!
t1_dv0k9do	1	*	Or maybe they use some sort of option in between killing them and praying? As an American I'm sure that's hard to imagine.
t1_dv08qfb	1	*	Do you do poison?   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEyUeCyXl1Q

t1_dtmm39t	1	*	You don't need to eat cows. You prefer it.   Selling lions bred in captivity and got so old, sick or dangerous probably has more value to the population than a cow being butchered for its meat.
t1_dsjfc63	0	*	I'm sure you're right, but sarcasm against whom? I'm not aware of any group that makes such a claim so that they deserve mocking about it.

t1_dswijro	0	*	6 weeks off(who knows how long really, complications exist) and probable reduced productivity for who knows how long, yeah I'd be stoked as an employer to have a new employee lay that at my feet
t1_dsx9b5j	1	*	That's ignoring historical context though. It doesn't happen very often that a head of government is pregnant. 
t1_dsw2u9c	1	*	Hm... it was a bit of a joke, yes?
t1_dsx903c	0	*	Not really. You have breast pumps and baby formula nowadays is just as good as breast milk. Ergo, you don't need a mom who's around 24/7.

t1_dsx96k3	1	*	Alabama doesn't have to deal with international politics though...   Either way, the NZ government works different from the US. The PM has less power compared to a US president. 
t1_dswq33l	1	*	And what is he going to do about without Parliament backing? NZ PM does not have any executive power over the house.

t1_ds7lb42	1	*	Ok, explain to me why its ok to eat one animal over the other.  Calling my argument stupid is not the same as offering a rebuttal. 
t1_ds7oakj	1	*	Yeah, Asian countries had different breeds that were meant for hunting vs. guarding vs. eating/sacrifice. 
t1_ds7cxoj	0	*	Hmmm all I can say is if they are prepared to bite me then they should also expect to be completely eradicated.  Eye for an eye (my fav moral law).

t1_dsnnjhq	1	*	Because these people are traitors to Britain. They want Trump as their HoS so much that they have sworn allegiance to him. They should be arrested and charged with treason and terrorism.

t1_dt9pvcr	1	*	A little late, but [here](https://youtu.be/-Kkib-3ruvI?t=25s) you go. I've started it at his statements from 2015, but you should watch the entire video.

t1_dsjkz3q	1	*	The nuclear football
t1_dsjh5wm	1	*	You should check out HardTalk on the BBC. They generally do a great job of driving the issues home during their interviews. I'd love to see more of that in North American media.
t1_dsjp87o	0	*	Really? He was white? There were no other white politicians at the time people could have burned and eaten? Because either way, sounds like an interesting story here...

t1_dsjfm8f	0	*	Any then he tries saying that he didnt use the term 'fake news' just minutes earlier. Poor reporter is clearly not used to this pathetic attempt at gaslighting, he's just speechless. 
t1_dsjn5te	1	*	Dutch Trump supporter checking in.
t1_dsjdv0z	1	*	Jim Acosta is trying to bring that back.   
t1_dsji176	0	*	Media has consolidated in the US to a few major corporations.  This erodes the public's trust.  Definitely not a black and white issue to support or not support the MSM.
t1_dsjcj5c	0	*	I thought the hands thing was Belgium
t1_dsjhzt3	1	*	It's cool, come back anytime. We realise that the racists and trump supporters don't leave the country or probably never left their state so most Americans I meet are great people.
t1_dsk95pi	0	*	He means you're using an unrelated incident from a decade ago to try and defend this liars bullshit statements about the present.  You're incapable of honest discussion.

t1_dsjf6pr	1	*	Tim Pool is definitely not a liberal
t1_dskpxra	1	*	This man served in Congress for over a decade. His constituents must be fucking morons.
t1_dslhhdb	1	*	It's good PR towards the readers though. They might gain more readers
t1_dsj7ih6	1	*	Another problem being that (with a few exceptions) legitimate journalists don't get any face time with Trump and have to resort to shouting questions as he's on the way to/from something else.
t1_dsjfdjk	1	*	It's embarassing on so many levels. For me, it's the fact that we have to go to the fucking Netherlands to get straight questions thrown at these pricks.

t1_dsjasd4	1	*	I feel the same about presidential debate moderators.
t1_dsjofsu	1	*	As a European I think it would maybe be best to just send these clowns home and close their embassies. To spare the embarrassment for everyone. It's just not funny anymore. 
t1_dsjgoo2	1	*	Please don't. Signed, an actual Canadian.  
t1_dsj9uuu	1	*	Yeah i don't know it either. But I tell you this the best quote that came out of u/dutchkickboxer. And he has the best quotes

t1_dsjh1it	1	*	And in the end he's just a massive, gaping cunt.
t1_dsjqnyu	1	*	Not to mention multiple options on both the left and right. More competition for votes and bi-partesen goverments

t1_dsjbvgy	1	*	We did that once. The politician beat the crap out of that journalist. That politician is now a senator.
t1_dsjmamf	1	*	Eh, we have the PVV and Geert Wilders.  He's pretty well as bad as Trump.    Well, OK, not so bad as Trump.  He can at least give a coherent speech...
t1_dsjgh8c	1	*	Just like we [don't euthanise our elderly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0V4U0dOax3Y) or that they wear bracelets that say: please don't euthanise.

t1_duz5x19	1	*	That doesn't make it correct.  It's still grammatical spackery.
t1_duzgiu4	0	*	The real question is why would you go through with Brexit. Just pretend it never happened and move on, it's not that hard.

t1_du01vza	1	*	Well, he is orange.
t1_du14p1b	1	*	So it's funny to you that it sounds like something Trump would say... Even though it wasn't even the Trump impersonator saying it? Odd sense of humor
t1_du017v2	0	*	I wonder which country that would be, because I could definitely see them getting kicked out at a major U.S. event. 
t1_du01yku	0	*	I often make this joke and it always get downvoted  because they don't know the Stewart Lee sketch about people who don't understand what political correctness is.
t1_du0rutk	1	*	That only adds more barriers.
t1_du01mgp	0	*	Trump makes political arguments?
t1_du03ckj	0	*	>literally the same  This is why no one takes you seriously.
t1_du0cnbp	1	*	Dont bother. Hes a frequent poster from you-know-where who has posted some lovely content.
t1_du0dh3e	0	*	Second one, Trump-guy looks like hes doing a Silvio Dante (Stevie Van Zandt on the Sopranos) impression. 
t1_du02aq0	1	*	Yeah, had that same charm I was looking for after Bruce Almighty
t1_du04fy0	0	*	> Just being negative towards Trump is good enough for ~~liberals~~ lefties to justify any stupidity.     FTFY
t1_dspo1av	1	*	No.
t1_dt3zifu	1	*	If you live in Arizona, you are probably fine.
t1_duwbras	0	*	> Yemen is underemployed in an era of automation  That's not really relevant to Yemen, as Yemen is so underdeveloped they still don't have much automation at this point. 
t1_dtcl6z0	0	*	Are you sure that's the only reason you aren't having kids?
t1_dtcfwm9	1	*	Unless you're a multi billion dollar oligarch it is really about the only thing you can do to attempt to have an impact on policy...
t1_dtcu3ei	1	*	What about it? This estimate [of methane hydrates] is corresponding to 5002500 gigatonnes carbon (Gt C)... The permafrost reservoir has been estimated at about 400 Gt C in the Arctic.
t1_dtcjxqg	0	*	Well those industries wouldn't be able to destroy if they weren't making any money, would they?

t1_dtiefrm	0	*	Oh you're so edgy.
t1_dtcqj0b	1	*	We have more than enough food to feed 10 billion people currently, yet we do not because it is not profitable. Scarcity is fabricated. 
t1_dsaqy4w	1	*	Are there any legitimate iranian new sources? As far as I thought, they were  all controlled by the regime
t1_dsbf0w9	1	*	media has lost all credibility.  I read as entertainment only and suspect most of what I read is complete fabrication.   have an upvote. 
t1_dsjqbrk	0	*	Average wage means nothing when cost of living is so high. The u.s has the highest extremes, that's what I mean
t1_dsjpk4b	0	*	>/r/worldnews is for major news from around the world except US-internal news / US politics  Frankly, this subreddit is just a bot driven, Super PAC funded cesspool.
t1_dun9c01	0	*	But that isn't unique to capitalism? That is simply greedy people in power, something that is present in all forms of economies, no?
t1_duna4h2	0	*	Not really.
t1_dulmwd0	0	*	Nope, but I think if you give some people money they definitely will waste it away
t1_dum7i6m	0	*	Which is blown out of proportion due to the insane wages of those at the top.
t1_dumbnie	1	*	Certain demographics. 
t1_dumljd1	0	*	I'd imagine it's 2% and 17% of population of the given population range.  Even if it wasn't 17/20= 85% while 2/5= 40%
t1_dspl5e3	1	*	Since the term Palestinian refugee is limited to persons residing in UNRWA's areas of operation in the Palestinian territories, Lebanon, Jordan and Syria it seems that you aren't telling the truth.
t1_dsp1sk5	1	*	> liberals lose their minds   Don't spin this like I'm the one being partisan
t1_dspn4w2	0	*	Every refugee ever has faced discrimination though. I don't know if I'd consider citizenship to Israel as discrimination. 
t1_dsor5vp	1	*	way to fail to get the point of the comment you are responding to. 
t1_dsq3wti	1	*	Welcome. Just keep your clothes on. 
t1_dsoqw3t	1	*	That for some reason is because most of the Jews living in Poland were moved to concentration camps where they were starved, tortured, or summarily executed.
t1_dspov9p	1	*	Dude if anything, it hinders the 1%, they can't get illegal workers and have to pay the regular wage. 
t1_dspfo1j	1	*	Isn't Israel a refuge from 1945? I mean, if the UK had stuck the Jews anywhere else in the world (like Sudan), you'd probably still be calling them refugees of WW2. 
t1_dsp79o2	0	*	>Plus aiding israel allows for an ally in the region with similar values  Similar values? Like declaring themselves a state belonging to one ethnicity?
t1_dspywy9	0	*	Again you fail to argue policy.
t1_dsq9zdc	1	*	The UN will be right onto that just as soon as they're finished with their 116th anti-Israel motion for the session.
t1_duc1wj8	1	*	Yeah... I mean, can you imagine what kind of harm can these weapon maker do if the money is dry and they are desperate for cash?  Better just keep feeding them than having them run loose.
t1_dtpr48i	0	*	Maybe detaining them? What if cops tried to stop you and you kept going, would that be reason enough for them to kill you? The problem is in the killing part, not them trying to protect the border.
t1_dtm0qij	1	*	I think he's claimed that, but he's claimed a lot of things.
t1_dtm8pfs	1	*	Didn't he claim to have stabbed/shot a guy to death or something in college too?
t1_dtmhmdm	1	*	Nope.
t1_dtlvi9r	1	*	Yeah.  Hence him not liking christianity as a whole.
t1_ds1i7t8	1	*	I applaud efforts for free governments and societies, but I wonder. What have you done to earn your freedom?
t1_ds1x4qp	0	*	Not really. The reason they fled China to HK likely isnt there anymore by 1997
t1_ds2w7jk	0	*	> breaking into properties.  Sit-ins can certainly be trespassing  and still be classified as civil disobedience.   
t1_dv41l9h	1	*	Its is a contraction meaning it *is*  Then again Im just a bit triggered that my Uber fare today was 49 bones to go to the airport in Nashville.  Crazy.
t1_dv43a45	1	*	Uber doesn't pay by experience as far as I know. They just pay everyone the same. They are basically the most equal in that regard.
t1_dv48sze	1	*	Isn't the cost of a medallion hundreds of thousands if not a million in NYC? No one with just a work ethic could afford that. 
t1_dv3sml6	1	*	He probably doesn't do it every day. My friend only goes out when he's not going to be doing anything else important and/or there's a surge. You just gotta be smart about how you spend your time. 
t1_dv3pt3z	0	*	Live where it is really cold in the winter or really hit in the summer.  Where do you live that makes that question a hard one, Hawaii?
t1_dv41jsf	1	*	Yeah, lets keep incorrecting each other
t1_dv3zzn0	0	*	but will they? then they have to have insurance, pay for gas and deal with people. if you let others then all that is on the person who owns the car. 
t1_dv4aqaw	0	*	The haven't solve the cleaning issue. People are nasty 
t1_dv3suec	0	*	You're right. Unfortunately for people with minimal skills (or under appreciated skills) in a minimum wage job a 72 hour week still only nets you like 65K a year. 
t1_dsgm712	1	*	They might as well be. Look on that list: many are listed as a group. The waltons etc.

t1_dsehmcv	1	*	I see. The article makes it very unclear whose fault this is.
t1_ds3ijij	0	*	Funny how its never somebody making a polite, well mannered and well reasoned argument though isn't it?
t1_du54mty	1	*	It would help one to see through the left-right back-and-forth noise and expose the motives of those in power.
t1_du5zgk8	0	*	Served Nazi Germany in the Nazi army, followed Nazi objectives, helped round up Jews.  The myth that Rommel was some sort of hero or anti Nazi is just that, a myth.
t1_du643r1	1	*	right wingers are masters at playing the victim thinking they are the resistance from star wars or something even when they are in power for years. Its the same in Israel.
t1_du4vhaj	1	*	Ofcourse! He wasn't a liberal! /s
t1_du5fgor	1	*	Not a surprise. Its easy to sell bigoted ideas and policies to low information voters, and theres no other kind of voter in trailer parks worldwide.
t1_dur6q96	1	*	The worst of it is in the oceans, really.  Irukandji and Box Jellies are some nasty fuckers.

t1_dus68dt	1	*	Congrats, you knocked over a strawman.
t1_durma4g	1	*	Having a gun literally has protected me and my family in this exact example. Not wanting to be shot by a cornered person is a much stronger deterrent than you think.
t1_dura307	1	*	So.. gun control? Regardless of whether you take him seriously or his arguements are accurate in every regard, it's not a counter arguement to gun control
t1_durjtfq	0	*	the sale of Telstra was actually a good thing as far as internet speeds go.  While Telstra was still a public company it was horrendous, after the sale things were merely bad.
t1_dura1yb	0	*	But to propose to change or amend it is unconstitutional?
t1_durgy1g	1	*	You guys should ask Native Americans, Cambodians, and Armenians how they feel about gun control,   and how well it worked out for them in the past.
t1_dur8ol8	0	*	No events on the scale of American ones though.
t1_dus5g2y	1	*	No we wouldn't?
t1_durakih	1	*	And here we see a problem with this debate: inability to talk in good faith.  Someone makes a typo on the type of gun used, and it gets a response like this.
t1_durk51d	0	*	Your point is 100% fair. Not sure why you're being downvoted.
t1_dusqqwp	0	*	They have higher mass shooting rates. Can't take out 60 people from a hotel window with a knife.

t1_dudu12p	1	*	This, these people dont understand that the majority of the right wing is *actually* this bad. They wouldnt believe everything they see on fox news if it wasnt. 
t1_due37io	0	*	It's not? 
t1_dudrq6h	1	*	> To do what?  Who knows but it's not like we haven't seen a significant number of fake hate crime accusations in the past.
t1_dudn8y6	1	*	But this kind of fake news trolling has been major force in world politics over the last few years.  This is the bleeding edge of the culture wars.
t1_duffn9j	0	*	Son, you seem to a) not read Marvel comics and b) deserve thanks for slotting a dude at the end of his thirties into the teenage years.

t1_dtmow9n	1	*	Easily kicked up in the wind. At least every 5 years there are desert storms that rain sand over a vast area. I've seen then reach the South of France in the past making the sky red.
t1_dtb3f3x	1	*	How am I name calling? I listed many many facts, and the only reason I called him filth is because he called me an idiot.

t1_dua431r	1	*	That's like saying all insects fall under the definition of bugs. It's factually wrong. 
t1_dua155j	1	*	I'm guessing you're making a sarcastic joke and everyone missed it; what with legislation trying to construe criticism of Israel as anti-semetic. If so sorry about the downvotes, if not fuck off.

t1_du6uyh3	0	*	They're the US's nukes and Turkey has no control over them. Because of Permissive Action Links, Turkey cannot arm or deploy them without the DoD codes.

t1_dtt5ge7	1	*	It's obviously satire
t1_dttgih8	1	*	Half of the US would disagree.
t1_dtsyxib	1	*	don't let the US hear you
t1_dttcrel	1	*	Surely a poll conducted by a corrupt religious regime three years ago is completely accurate.
t1_dttciak	1	*	Iran and Turkey are switching places.
t1_dtt4wb2	0	*	Nobody is defending forcing women to wear hijabs, fortunately.
t1_dttnz2r	1	*	Anyone who gets their information about Iran from FOX will laugh at you.  Anybody who actually knows Iranian people will agree with you. 
t1_dtta8e2	1	*	Afwan ya akhi!
t1_dtu8hcg	1	*	If you're interested in Fidel Castro [here](http://www.nationalreview.com/article/456092/being-fidel-jr-life-and-death-castros-son) is a fascinating bio of his late son.
t1_dttm574	0	*	But you are obviously a westernized or secular Muslim. Not sure you are representative of the community.
t1_dtt5lyl	1	*	Spreading and forcing are 2 different things. When Jehovah's witnesses come to my door, they don't bring guns and haul me off to jail if I say I'm not interested.
t1_dtsuvf4	1	*	That analysis ignores the fact that Mossadeq ruled by decree using emergency power for his entire time, and even dissolved the Iranian parliament a few days before he was overthrown.
t1_dtsluc0	1	*	So it's just unlucky for them that the US and UK installed a dictator?
t1_dtskksg	0	*	Which is no correction since in both cases the radical islamistic movements were financed by exactly the one power that now fights it wherever it can. 
t1_dtthg68	1	*	I would expect it to be both but it's easier to insist on a restriction for others than yourself. 
t1_dtt1hpr	1	*	Puppet for the US and Britain before. Iran is extremely complicated.
t1_dtsywi5	1	*	The folks that overthrew the Shah were secular college students. They didn't understand the threat of religious radicals. They paid for that mistake with their lives. 
t1_dtt07ga	0	*	Which I think is dumb   And I'm a guy
t1_dttbj9v	0	*	Not a single woman has been executed for this. Jailed shortly and fined? Yes. Nobody has been murdered for it.
t1_dtt2epe	0	*	Not too bad actually. It's a very nice city.   My family just visited.    
t1_dtsv01b	0	*	Im Muslim and choose to wear one. Thanks for telling me how I, a Muslim woman, feel and make choices without any irony whatsoever.
t1_du3x15v	1	*	Lol thanks.
t1_du3n4an	1	*	Lol you're a funny troll. You should try your chops at a stand up club
t1_du2u4c3	0	*	Yeah there was nothing. Just another aspect of birther klansmen who still can't get over a non white president.
t1_du3t3qm	1	*	Hillary is not my buddy.
t1_dspmeic	1	*	Anti-science combats the notion that there is a power higher than their superstition.  
t1_dsplkj7	0	*	Why are you using the singular number? It is an entire movement going back well over a century, not one preacher.
t1_dspkxbe	0	*	> Well no it shouldnt anti vaxxers arent religion specific.  They are in this case. It's Muslim clerics preaching that vaccines are against Islamic law, so their religion is pretty relevant. 
t1_dspkxt1	0	*	What the fuck was he talking about then? In a post about Muslim anti vaxxers? He was being a racist prick.
t1_dsr2yct	1	*	It's truly incredible how disagreeable the man is.
t1_dspn91z	0	*	So, you didn't want an answer, you wanted an argument - and just invented an opinion you want me to have to facilitate it.  Go away.
t1_dsptxhp	1	*	Fuck you. All hail the Plaugelord!
t1_dsq17wg	0	*	Afaik, he hasn't done anything about it. There was some talk about him appointing an anti-vaccer to a newly created vaccine safety commission, but that petered out. 
t1_dspjx7w	0	*	But the minute theres a problem go straight to science and hospital and beg for medicine
t1_dspil0i	1	*	Oh, my bad. That must be the reason why nobody vaccinates himself for a vacation. Thanks 
t1_dtauk82	1	*	Epigenetics, dude. It matters which ones you turn on and off with your lifestyle and environment. 
t1_dta3amg	0	*	[Heavy Cream](https://www.artofdrink.com/cocktail/cocktails-and-dairy-products-2) is your friend. The better the fat content the less it will curdle. Enjoy the best of both worlds.
t1_dtaqzxi	0	*	what you eat affects your genes though  If you eat a lot of lipids and inflammatory stuff then your DNA will get damaged leading to mutations
t1_dubvehf	1	*	Actually, they do since they [signed up to the 1951 Refugee Convention] (http://www.unhcr.org/protect/PROTECTION/3b73b0d63.pdf)
t1_dubwk5f	0	*	Doesn't mean Japan and the other signatories should be able to just say fuck it, we change our minds. The UN only works if the members adhere to the rules.
t1_duc29vj	1	*	Yeah it's a guy. One guy.
t1_ds1649r	0	*	> Except make it near completely unusable in day to day life.  Yep.  Wake me up when you can use btc as easily as my debit card to buy literally anything on the planet I desire.
t1_ds1z8qs	1	*	When housing bubbles burst, rent often goes up. People lose all their assets, including homes and become renters.
t1_ds1sqao	0	*	I COME FROM A LAND DOWN UNDER 
t1_ds16lvd	1	*	It's the fault of people who can't afford a house that house prices are so high?
t1_ds16ef7	1	*	I think the word coin being in the name may be partly to blame. It brings to mind an image of a single piece of physical metal.
t1_ds2cqhu	1	*	Linux is the backend nobody sees. Im sure block chain will be used by the banks as part of their networks, but well still be paying with our Visa cards.
t1_ds1dvmt	1	*	Why is that surprising? Not everyone is so familiar with bitcoin that they can tell you how many places it can divide to. We're not all bitcoin geniuses like you are.
t1_ds1rv9l	1	*	I'm no expert but couldn't the banks stand to make big profits from bitcoin? Or is the problem the cost of them doing a transaction or something?
t1_ds1n6az	1	*	And 28 hours to finish posting.  Fuck getting a cup of coffee. No one wants to mine that transaction so it gets ignored.
t1_ds17lej	0	*	Yeh, nah. Iv been touring tassy and houses in fucking devonport are still 675,000 for 2 bedroom. Super affordable not. 
t1_ds1szah	0	*	>*0.0004561 btc sounds about right*  Now it's 0.0005172 no wait 0.0004036.

t1_ds3dtl2	1	*	Canadian here. Have heard it before.
t1_dtj70wx	0	*	It was already burned down at that moment. Twice.
t1_dt1m8mw	1	*	Man, talk about setting the bar low and claiming victory.
t1_dt1mym3	1	*	Hilarious, thanks.
t1_dt1mt5m	0	*	being outraged 24/7 is the natural and only sensible response to the absolute horror of Trump and the Congressional Republicans
t1_dukd2yo	0	*	Punitive actions can act as a deterrent.
t1_dukc0wz	0	*	australia is that you?
t1_dukdbeh	0	*	We did that with Napoleon and he was back pretty soon.
t1_dukbgw5	1	*	They can leave their homes, but don't have to travel all the way to France.
t1_dsc9j18	1	*	Taxpayer money for everyone!  Seriously though, I like trees
t1_dsca5cl	1	*	That the 15cents per tree doesnt reflect the actual total cost of the project... they are not equivalent figures is my point.  
t1_dujbl4k	0	*	They did it in the US as well, its just standard procedure for them. 
t1_dujdtf0	0	*	https://mikopeled.com/
t1_dujarit	0	*	We dont have a water shortage problem. We have a salt problem, theres tons of water in the ocean.
t1_duj3vsg	0	*	everyone ignores bad news until they're on the verge of being screwed by it. 
t1_dujbujs	1	*	no outdoor water usage at all. Personal limits of 155lt. Rationing once it goes below 15%. 
t1_duj6cah	1	*	Why not sell the salt?
t1_duizjon	1	*	Why not pump the wastewater into ponds, let it dry and sell the salt?
t1_duiz6kg	1	*	Yeah but they aren't in the Mayan Empire anymore. 
t1_duk75kd	1	*	> Shut down Nestle's operations and drive up unemployment in your constituents.  > Accept bribes or just overlook that entirely.   Hmmm decisions decisions!
t1_duiykah	1	*	Only because coca cola ( I think) bought the rights and is already doing it in California :p
t1_dukcbw7	1	*	There used to be a broader-scoped docu called Watershed but it's been removed from Netflix. It's about the whole Colorado River problem. I recommend it!
t1_duiza98	1	*	Is it possible to use the waste for commercial salt production? 
t1_dujgscf	0	*	Will they be killed for it?
t1_duggyix	1	*	Russia wants a friendly Mediterranean port for it's military operations.
t1_dsrh3hf	0	*	Well, pesos uses $; do you want your wage to be paid in Pesos instead?
t1_dsrbm91	1	*	I don't know, if I explain my connection to HK and China are you going to call me a wumao because I have a differing opinion?
t1_dsgl81j	0	*	They are formidably enslaving us.

t1_dsb38vm	1	*	sometimes in an overly complex world, the only solution is a simple one.
t1_dtujb58	1	*	The fact that the two don't have anything to do with each other. Can be one, or the other, or both. Doesn't matter.
t1_ds1gk4u	1	*	You got downvoted because the truth stings.
t1_dtczonu	0	*	>That is completely fair  No it isnt. 
t1_dselvvb	1	*	/unexpectedarresteddevelopment

t1_dseqmml	1	*	Christ I hope my dad never has to take a lie detector test. 
t1_dsetst6	1	*	The darker interpretation of the Toy Story
t1_dsezrwb	1	*	He's talking shop, when it comes to politics he's way out of his depth
t1_dseq66e	0	*	Yes. On closed circuit TV to the grand jury. He addressed the country that night but his grand jury testimony wasnt released until a month later.
t1_dsgb4v1	1	*	I really don't know, it is starting to appear that many of the republicans maybe in bed with the Russians, nothing might actually be the right answer.
t1_dseqoy8	1	*	What's even more funny is that trump is referenced in these videos a year ago
t1_dsesy39	0	*	What crimes is he publicly committing on a daily basis?
t1_dser9nz	1	*	Wrong. I have the best stay on target. Sad. Wrong. You will lose it. Wrong.  [*insert Trump's evil, creepy stare*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KD5h50cqJV8)
t1_dsf1av5	1	*	He can scribble his name on executive orders... That counts for something, right?
t1_dsfazg6	1	*	well he is tho mate
t1_dsent7s	1	*	Dont worry, our president doesnt know the difference so why should we?
t1_dsfgvsx	0	*	Or a microwave.
t1_dsf1goc	1	*	Easy, he'll just get one of the white house staffers to tweet on his behalf, so it looks at least mostly-coherent. 
t1_dser547	1	*	Just tell him Obama's being accused of the crime because its so elaborate. He'll sing.
t1_dsf17mr	1	*	Pretty sure lawyers are able to win in a legal battle if he doesn't. It's the little guy you have to worry about.
t1_dsf4mt0	1	*	I mean, Popodopolous and Manafort have both been indicted for conduct before and during the 2016 campaign...
t1_dsev02l	1	*	That fan fic will end out outselling all of The_Dumbasses books combined lol. 
t1_dsfhtzk	1	*	I love that they didn't know what to do, so just threw in a random apostrophe.
t1_dsfwwpb	0	*	He gets an intelligence briefing every day but he seems dumber than ever, so I'm not sure your point tracks.
t1_dsfd35c	1	*	*Paging Oliver North! Mr Ollie North please come to the Tower*
t1_dsemx97	1	*	Al bundy was a legend. You hold your tongue!

t1_dsep3ll	0	*	Well his son admitted that he tried, we do not know if he was successful. 
t1_dseowcd	1	*	Or a toaster
t1_dseqxtr	1	*	Now this is a desperate position to take.  You guys can have it.  Wake me when Trump does something actionable.
t1_dsfopo5	1	*	The book says he is semi-literate. Which means he can't read but he can write, I guess.
t1_dsev72f	1	*	maybe he just has insomnia?
t1_dsepoxq	1	*	When he isn't trolling the media, this is how he talks. Look at all his old interviews before running for election.
t1_dsev2m6	0	*	If that defense is used, it means he's unfit for office anyway so win win
t1_dsf0s8e	1	*	Ahh thats an important point. Thanks.
t1_dsfo5ze	1	*	Trump writes the best words. Didn't you know?
t1_dsf254k	1	*	No random quotes on words that totally don't need it.
t1_dso1lcl	1	*	Yeah history is bound to repeat itself from those who dont learn from it
t1_dsomzri	1	*	Btw pls dont erase your comment I want people to have a discussion. That is the only way to get the information of the other side.
t1_dszweq5	1	*	But... but it's shiny.
t1_dtjsmsh	1	*	In the UK?
t1_dttlib8	1	*	You're weird bruh. Wrong and weird. 
t1_dsjps9f	1	*	I was thinking more like Husseins spider hole hideout and eventual conviction and hanging.
t1_duspeoi	1	*	Depends on the country. In many countries, it isn't possible to charge anyone this way.
t1_dtqbz5i	1	*	;)
t1_du1rnyz	0	*	Yes, if some does something it all fault of modi.  Meanwhile cause a genocide in Delhi by killing Sikhs.  We all know the real terrorist
t1_dtrosql	0	*	In all seriousness, please dont forget to take your meds.  I hope you feel better.
t1_dtvmfia	1	*	how do you know i'm not checking weather reports or road diversions? 
t1_dtvslno	0	*	Yeah, and this is warning them that they're impeding traffic.
t1_dtvc5ts	0	*	Especially since the French love their park anywhere button already. 
t1_dtukxhl	1	*	A pocket is OK.
t1_dtvfsds	0	*	Make it carry DWI penalties? So you want to have something with the potential to land you in jail in your pocket every time you drive? 
t1_dtuxgty	0	*	Well it's drivong conditions combined with human error / distraction.   >Or driving conditions *alone* FTFY
t1_du2qbja	1	*	Redditing while driving  
t1_dtvaxoc	1	*	In America. We're talking about France.
t1_dti2qw0	0	*	Nothing to see there. They used strava collars to map out the movements of a wombat colony. 
t1_dtivk09	1	*	I mean they could've just drilled the locks
t1_dtitmf8	1	*	It's almost like the government isn't a single hive mind entity and that different parties working within it can operate at different levels with different agendas.
t1_dtje116	1	*	That's it, some (percentage wise, without doing the maths I think very low) are true and I think that's more to do with luck than good planning ;)
t1_dsnr0bk	1	*	We're outraged by that because we don't think it's acceptable for our country to turn into China where you can touch both sides of your 'home' if you simply stretch both arms out.
t1_dsngh8s	0	*	Per calendar month eg on the first of every month
t1_ds4aias	1	*	True, for 17 years old they can start deportation procedure and by the time everything is in order the person will be 18 anyway.
t1_ds3v06e	0	*	If you're 18+ you should stay and fight/rebuild, is the logic
t1_ds3q38l	1	*	Clearly OP isn't a marijuana enthusiast 
t1_ds4bitj	1	*	inaccurate if you want to separate a 15 year old from a 17 year old. Plenty accurate to call out the 30 year old men claiming to be children.
t1_ds50lxm	1	*	I just said it's one way to screen. never said it was 100% accurate, or applicable.  But short of chopping the human in half and counting the rings in their spine nothing is going to be 100% accurate.
t1_ds3kw4h	0	*	Two years isnt accurate enough. 
t1_ds3nnrg	0	*	Because our morals dictate that children should be prioritized when there's scarcity and that they should be protected. 
t1_ds3gyes	1	*	You mean the current one that uses 0 verification of anything and leaves it up to purely arbitrary decisions by bureaucrats with agendas? 
t1_dspqfan	0	*	So Irish Catholic?
t1_dv50j49	1	*	What?  No way.  If you have an ace in your hand, then you tell everyone at the table.  And if you have no ace in your hand, then definitely don't bluff.
t1_dvc6x0o	0	*	I don't know but they have nuclear capable submarines that could be anywhere, including near Alaska I suppose.
t1_dv5n7ax	1	*	wat
t1_ds9h04r	1	*	I absolutely agree with that. 
t1_dszikaf	1	*	You really need to travel more

t1_dua3e00	0	*	Actually my parents weren't rageaholics who hit people a fraction of their size because they were failures at parenting. Like I presume yours were.
t1_dv3eekz	1	*	Higher than very low doesn't help as much. Check the chart and compare turnouts. 
t1_dv40hgv	1	*	Move to Australia
t1_dsy95t8	1	*	It's really nice to know that someone had the exact same experience as me. It began as a few memes taken too far but looking back on it, its pretty obvious what had happened.
t1_dsy1y9b	1	*	This is what i've heard as well, fund all the sides, fan flames from all angles and cause whatever shit you possibly can
t1_dsy1x9j	1	*	Where do they discuss Brexit as a policy?   No where, because the article isn't about Brexit.   You're taking a cosmetic statement and creating a theme, which is ridiculous. 
t1_dsvbzw4	0	*	Not so much arguing as specifying. And I just figured he was a fan of Santa.
t1_dtuq0cz	1	*	I get around 65mpg in my diesel car. I thought it would be more by now.

t1_dunms64	0	*	How do you drink things without them touching your teeth?
t1_dunb7sv	0	*	> if they have to use public transit when they have a cold  Yep. They do this in Taiwan. It's so freaking considerate, especially towards people that can get sick easily. 
t1_dunl1h9	1	*	suck it up :)
t1_duncr1z	0	*	Exactly! The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time ... was 19 years ago, but today is better than next year!

t1_dun1n1a	1	*	Well, no, the pipe cleaner is designed to be reused.
t1_dungf1k	0	*	They still suck to drink out of
t1_dungydf	0	*	It was just a box and it's lasted 3 years. They like to chew them and fetch it. Eventually a straw will be chewed too much to be thrown or my roomba will run over it. Then it's time for a new one. 
t1_dunc8ij	1	*	Lmao
t1_dunjyn6	1	*	There are places where I live that will not provide straws to people without disabilities that necessitate the use of straws. I do not understand the obsession with straws.
t1_dungnrd	0	*	What is this blasphemy?! I can't live without my bubble tea!! That being said, i agree on the minimisation of waste. Perhaps Starbucks tumbler style for bubble tea?
t1_dunes2r	1	*	Sucks. I work at McDonald's and die a little inside when I drop a few straws trying to fill up the straw dispenser. This company needs to change its single use plastics :(
t1_dunewu8	1	*	This was very strange to me haha.. Couldn't throw anything away because there were no cans.. Even outside a 7-11 or at a train station.. And still so clean.
t1_duo1tc9	0	*	Check out reusable stainless steel straws; they're awesome!
t1_dunkryc	1	*	I know right? Maybe there will be reusable straws.. but that sounds so nasty. 
t1_dunju6x	0	*	What about [straw](http://www.wynnes.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/3203045-600x436.jpg) straws are they just called straw or straws or straw straws?
t1_dund1xb	0	*	It's not always a matter about having better landfills, more a out avoiding the waste to begin with.
t1_dun8nah	0	*	I think it would be too thick to drink from the cup., no?    Granted I haven't had a McDonald's shake in a very long time.
t1_dunehug	1	*	>Taiwan is amazingly clean  lol, hell no
t1_dun7w23	0	*	>The US also probably has better landfills than many Asian countries  Compared in terms of level of development and adjusted for wealth/capability/size? I doubt it, to be honest.

t1_dun9a1z	1	*	Tokyo and Beijing are different places entirely. 
t1_dupfe0l	1	*	Unfortunately that's not what's happening, only the individuals are taking the blame, and only the individuals are making changes. 
t1_duni7fu	1	*	and a bread bag to hold your beef noodle in a bread bowl; soy milk in a bread cup; bread utensils; and of course, some bread.  
t1_duo0s84	1	*	Is this why tax on a case of water is $1.50?
t1_dunjvwt	1	*	Many have a door fee and then you drink as much as you want. By midnight, a lot  people are sleeping at their booths. No one fucks with them, no one draws dix on peoples faces, it's a utopia. 
t1_dund19s	0	*	 Thought they would have more flavour. 
t1_dtnkcx6	1	*	Thanks
t1_dtnbj2w	1	*	I knew I should have got in when I had the chance. 
t1_dttauqz	0	*	For him to just come out with the most ridiculous inconsequential lies.  *You're late*  *No I'm not* **quotes Gandelf**
t1_dtv05kz	1	*	The buffer against consequences that wealth affords is also a factor.
t1_dtu7bqd	0	*	His ego is too big to say that, he has the best memory ever right?
t1_dtsyxw4	0	*	My parents said that as well, that he used to be a really great speaker and now he just doesn't make any sense sometimes but goes ahead with it anyways
t1_dtsxdop	0	*	You're new to this thread and our friend /u/FarewellAddress I see
t1_dtto7l2	1	*	Wow, I didn't see this.  It's more real than I imagined.  Someone get him the fuck out of that chair PLEASE.
t1_dttd5dz	1	*	I really don't care about interviews, but I'd like a return of press conferences. Has Trump done a proper press conference since the impromptu one last February or March? 
t1_dtsyg2l	0	*	I have to think he wouldnt want to be charged with a process crime like Flynn, or like Clinton.
t1_dtt8g7t	0	*	Putin2020?
t1_dttwl39	1	*	The 5th  
t1_dtttsze	1	*	> It's like he can't maintain a train of thought for 15 seconds before derailing.  You've omitted a decimal point. 1.5 seconds.
t1_dttlyyy	0	*	But they can point out his previous clear spoken answers to questions aaaaand.....   Damn - has he been playing the long game all along?
t1_dttz2fd	1	*	The best case scenario is that they bait him into confessing by accident - the man is a braggart, soothe his ego and he'll sing like a canary.  
t1_dudiuk6	1	*	Wtf? You know our country is free for us and for the people visiting right? Freedom of speech applies to them just as much as you.
t1_duddbck	1	*	who gives a shit about her the only thing she can is complain  Meanwhile u are the only person talking about her
t1_durvnft	1	*	I remender the first Honda 4 cylinder motorbikes from those ancient days, we called them Rice Burners
t1_ds7epo4	1	*	It does not, Pakistan isn't exactly well liked, and these issues of minority discrmination are already known world wide, and it isn't alone.  So no, it will no.
t1_ds7hatz	0	*	Yes, that's what I meant. It's also nowhere near the extent that it reaches in Pakistan.   Then debate it? I'm very interested in hearing when my country denies citizens rights.
t1_ds6pl2q	1	*	Be free somewhere else
t1_ds8kfdb	1	*	Turns out Ireland deserves to be on the list for severe violations of religious freedom as well I guess.
t1_ds6ld6i	1	*	Sadly......
t1_ds837as	1	*	I can't be anti semitic considering I am a semite. I just despise the Israeli and Saudi regimes
t1_ds6m2n8	1	*	Turkey is no longer secular. The government is actively sectarian. It's a religiously-dominated country.
t1_ds713hq	1	*	Also, because it's an archipelago, IMO. Personally, I think in terms of concrete landmasses.

t1_ds7hwex	0	*	That regulation has probably been rescinded by the Trump Administration. If CFCs are cheaper, companies make more profit.
t1_ds7kc55	1	*	But yet here we are. Relax the goal was to repair the ozone layer and it getting better. Does it matter who get the praise? Btw there isn't any proof Trump didn't fix it while golfing?

t1_dsbhilp	1	*	Come again?
t1_ds6iwoq	1	*	The coastal populated areas might be but most of Vanuatu won't. Unlike some Pacific nations, Vanuatu is made up of mountainous, rocky islands, with a maximum elevation of 1900m.

t1_ds6ft3f	1	*	And still OP is upvoted for an idiotic comment about how companies are far more powerful than countries when it's clearly the opposite and those firms a reacting to powerful countries.
t1_ds6ean9	1	*	I honestly think those who would aren't even aware of what true human rights ought to be. Then again it's anecdotal but I think studies must have been done on this topic by now.

t1_ds70f5j	0	*	I think you have a twisted idea of 'liberal thought process'. Why would there be objection to a website, any website, running it how they see fit? *That's* what free speech is.

t1_ds6d8fr	0	*	Monopoly on what? Social media? Of course not
t1_ds79vru	1	*	I'd very much disagree with that. Cuba, USSR, GDR, Venezuela etc are/were all very oppressive and most certainly not conservative.

t1_ds74tne	1	*	Google is also collecting and selling your online 'personality' just as facebook are.
t1_ds782h5	1	*	Jews should not be allowed to own big companies.  When a company gets too big, it's board of directors should all be vetted and appointed atheists.

t1_dsh7yla	0	*	Well the people who are tipping Tim Hortons employees clearly aren't the one's involved in boycotting Tim Hortons.
t1_dsi529y	1	*	And similarly it's illegal for the employees to not report those tips as income, which I'm sure most of them don't

t1_dsbudcn	1	*	I mean the Russians have somewhat of a claim on Crimea. That's why they annexed it. I'm not justifying that, but it's the main difference.

t1_dsc6spx	1	*	There is no way even all the combined militaries of the nordic countries could stop the Russians in the baltics. Maybe 40 years ago, but not today.
t1_dsbuzss	1	*	Full scale means full military maneuvers and shitloads of people(100k+), while total war would be mobilizing the civilian population and practicing producing military goods with repurposed factories. 
t1_dsc1x3w	1	*	Historically, the Russians took fallout shelters more seriously than anyone else. I saw one in Moscow. It was pretty impressive.

t1_dv0e58l	1	*	Venezuelans are already starving and there's been no revolution yet.
t1_dv0y8n6	1	*	Because white supremacists have referenced the violence against white people in Africa before, so now the rest of us are supposed to pretend that it isn't real and never happened.   
t1_duzxw1w	1	*	That's looking at people as individuals, we can't have you doing that - it works against our narratives.
t1_dv05yrz	0	*	Are you saying that we should treat people differently because of the color of their skin and not treat them by their merit?
t1_duzxaup	1	*	What is this?

t1_dump098	1	*	Only the parts Israel doesn't want to steal.
t1_ds3rwdg	1	*	Yeah... well I didnt die from an accident either so I still was part of the statistic I guess.
t1_ds2tiy0	1	*	Was it the tea machine? My flight was delayed and even threatened to be cancelled on Christmas Eve over a fault in the hot drinks machine...

t1_ds2v7qy	1	*	Omg, I should have got that from context. Strange abbreviation though.  Thanks!
t1_ds2x00n	0	*	The grandparent's joke boils down to 0/x = infty. The parent notes what if x = 0?.

t1_ds2wu60	1	*	So... duct tape then?
t1_ds2t11a	1	*	Same thing.
t1_ds3bb8x	1	*	Just say 'asian'. It's harder to be wrong when generalizing to a huge portion of humanity.
t1_ds2rmkz	1	*	So if last year there were zero accident deaths and at least one baby born in flight, then there was a net increase in passengers.
t1_ds2r13f	1	*	Have you ever been to T_D or even visited the president's Twitter? 
t1_ds2ybwe	1	*	Well I just got to skip my 4 hour layover on United so its a mixed bag. Granted I could still be yanked off of the plane at this point...
t1_ds2ofgf	1	*	Yeah I think a % passenger killed would be a bit more reflective of a growing industry.
t1_ds3d3za	0	*	Steak?

t1_ds2zam4	1	*	# 4 U
t1_ds2u007	0	*	You should call him edgy or retarded, and be otherwise overly aggressive and demeaning, like you do other liberal comments.  And then wonder some more why people are reluctant about TD posters.  
t1_ds39o0y	0	*	Point out where he took credit for it?
t1_ds36nt8	0	*	I thought it was a joke about conservatives blaming Obama for everything

t1_ds3kzwh	1	*	Because sadly you have a lot of people that are saying it seriously. Try adding the /s sxf3 people know your not serious

t1_ds33fsz	0	*	Implying you can have a discussion in good faith anywhere on Reddit 
t1_ds3gfz7	1	*	Mysteriously, there have been no terrorist attacks against US airlines from any of the banned countries since 9-11. Miraculous.

t1_ds32w60	1	*	I helped a lot this year 
t1_ds3095r	1	*	Presumably it's due to the future itenerary of the plane. Your airport may have been the only place to handle it in the reasonable future 
t1_ds2r8or	1	*	He was also violating federal law by not exiting the aircraft when ordered to do so.
t1_ds3phlu	1	*	r/madlads

t1_ds38bhd	1	*	my mom saved the life of a man on a plane who was having a heart attack. (aspirin, found his nitro.)
t1_ds2t1my	0	*	Even if that was the case, that doesn't change the fact that a woman was hauled off her flight (not even refunded!) which she paid for first.
t1_ds3gjin	1	*	450 people die every year from FALLING OUT OF BED.  Seriously, the human mind and it's irrationality knows no bounds.
t1_ds2y1vn	1	*	In your seat, get a beat
t1_ds3cvji	1	*	Regarding your edit, an American Airlines flight crashed in Queens after taking off at JFK in November 2001.
t1_ds30r4f	0	*	He is truly the windbag beneath our wings.
t1_ds378pn	1	*	No no. The world needs someone to feed him some cock and bull story about a reduction in gun murders. Then let him piss off a chunk of his base by claiming to have regulated guns successfully. 
t1_ds2s52e	0	*	Youre sure? Do you work in the industry?
t1_ds2rnnt	0	*	They cant though. The financial penalties of being caught are immense. Not only do you need to pay any regulatory fines, but the loss of customer trust is absolutely immense.
t1_ds2rokj	1	*	Oh, the things women miss out on. It's another world. 
t1_dv2ynea	1	*	Hmmm.... I doubt it....  Ignoring longer term consequences for short term gains seems like a systematic way to cause a crisis.
t1_dv301wh	1	*	If you look at the wealth distribution numbers you will see that during recessions the 1% go down the most. Ill link you to the numbers in a while once Im off mobile.
t1_dv1nmpm	0	*	Chump change.  What we really have to worry about is the mole people invasion from the underground.
t1_dtnb0tr	0	*	Arguement? Nah, I dont have one of those. Just trying to keep things in their proper context. Knowledge is power!
t1_dtn71jd	1	*	... and guilty pleas and indictments. 
t1_dsfyb9i	0	*	Living somewhere racists don't want you to live = literally being a Nazi.  The Palestinian cause has no moral or intellectual legitimacy.
t1_dsga3bl	0	*	The nazi analogy is terrible. Dont make analogies like that. It gives the impression that you have a strong distaste for Jewish people. 
t1_dt9o2a0	0	*	Racism isn't against black people only. It's against any minority. 
t1_dt9pf5z	0	*	That is a fluff editorial. Having Ivanka Trump in a powerless position in the White House means very little.
t1_dtwjstp	0	*	Obviously you don't work in the tech industry. There are a limited number of people who know how hacking works and it would be absurd to focus those resources on the inmate population
t1_dux7682	0	*	These days you have to ask
t1_duy13hy	1	*	Pol Pot killed people who wore glasses because it was a sign of being an 'intellectual'.

t1_duxhjry	0	*	Iran has a religious government, so therefore in many ways a religious society.   > it has religious national symbolic  Try picking your words better if you actually want to make some kind of point.
t1_duxouo1	1	*	You can't apply logic or rationality to religion, it'll just make your head spin.
t1_duy1twx	0	*	It's a violation of the Logan Act and a form of treason. He got away with it because he could not recall when he was being questioned - at which point he'd been diagnosed with Alzheimer's.
t1_duxsclg	1	*	Iranians are white.
t1_duxzibs	0	*	The reasoning is that they think sexual freedom and promiscuity would lead to prostitution. I know it's stupid and wrong. I'm just saying that's probably what the thought process is. 
t1_duxlcka	1	*	it's like what Chris Rock said about not eating pork:      [link](https://youtu.be/eybZtDx6tAU?t=114)

t1_duznnyz	1	*	his god is a subjective god. it's just too bad his god wasn't objective instead
t1_duxmii1	1	*	*Now, would you kindly abdicate the throne?*
t1_duy4m0u	1	*	It's whatever. That's the ebb and flow of life, culture, and nations.  Life isn't always fair. 
t1_duxr1dc	0	*	Every single one of them? Some women used to burn bras but some women still choose to wear them.   Picking what a woman can or can't wear for them is the root of the problem. 
t1_duxj8jx	1	*	Nice straw man.
t1_duybs6g	1	*	People that believe in gods do not do it using any logical or critical thinking .
t1_duxpht2	1	*	Not really.  While we're on the topic, did a 13 year old girl born to muslim parents *choose* to be muslim in the first place?  
t1_duxo16a	1	*	It's actually forbidden in Islam to marry just for sex. it even has a name called zwage al'muta translating into marriage for pleasure. which is Ha'ram. Islam isn't bad humans are bad. 
t1_duxnd7h	1	*	It's about control, not faith. 
t1_duygwcu	0	*	If we don't learn from the mistakes of our future, we're doomed to repeat them for the first time.
t1_duxuzjl	1	*	Information easily found on one of the most studied events of the 20th Century. 
t1_duy0tj8	0	*	In regard to refugees?
t1_duzdw08	1	*	That's your opinion. Clearly not one that these women share. Would you ask your daughter, sister or mother to wear one? 
t1_duy2kj2	0	*	Gotta love how you're negligent to history.
t1_duxmqeb	0	*	It's prostitution with extra steps
t1_duxmwtq	1	*	Yeah well it turns out people who treat women and others like shit pick and choose what they want to believe. Rationalizing, denying, etc. They're just full of shit
t1_duxyd6z	1	*	1) Dae feminists ?   2) Lol liberals   3) Progressive left /s   4) No (yes)      It's a new Bethesda meme, right ?
t1_duxrxbu	1	*	Isn't that how it's written though? Is there such a thing in Islam as the spirit of the law?
t1_duximc8	1	*	Could happen in any authoritarian government. Actually it doesn't even have to be authoritarian. 
t1_duxkzng	0	*	It is a milestone *because* it is a basic human right that they are no longer being deprived of.
t1_duxgxt6	0	*	I am going to go ahead and third this calling of a cunt
t1_duxi9ce	0	*	There are several kinds of progressive. The one you just stated is most likely anti-religion. They will shit on every religion equally including islam.
t1_duxr5b1	0	*	How are people considered poor in fucking America?   On topic, do you think forcing a woman to wear something she doesn't want to wear in public is a form of oppression? 
t1_duxyf9c	0	*	Yes. And many religious doctrines teach that sexual freedom = bad. 
t1_duxddzs	1	*	Yes. Some people legitimacy think that way. We have to be sure.
t1_duxkhkl	1	*	Yes. It's like letting people make their own choice is the only solution.
t1_duxwfkz	1	*	Mutaa or Misyar ... Whatever you want to call it's the same thing
t1_duxjsxj	1	*	 No, just you.   Source: Im American
t1_duy174p	0	*	Okay well yeah I'll agree that there's a reasonable threshold for how upset you should get at a trivial problem like that
t1_duxo911	1	*	Qatar is Sunni.

t1_dv7c82h	1	*	They aren't on a national level though. Not anymore.
t1_duxvu4x	0	*	Has nothing to do with religion. In fact, it's people exploiting the religious beliefs of these poor girls.
t1_duxjf4p	1	*	Whoa That was deep
t1_dtdh2ho	1	*	saying they'll reimburse everybody could likely be a smoke and mirrors show, basically stall on it for awhile, calm people down.  
t1_dtdmavx	1	*	To be fair some transactions in the US take a long time(like paying off credit cards), I hear Europe is much better at this
t1_dtdd2nc	1	*	It's just NEM though. If they'd steal 3.3% of bitcoins or ethereum then that would be a huge deal.

t1_dt5hvgo	1	*	Great grandfather owned a store and was a pharmacist in Iowa starting in 1902. Anything was available 'over the counter' until we got 'narcs' with prohibition. Creating criminals.  
t1_dt4pzpm	0	*	Hell, she is the daughter of his former boss and close friend.
t1_dt55e44	1	*	You're absolutely right. This is why people have been using it to self medicate for mild stress for centuries.

t1_dt4nfzo	0	*	where do you find it?
t1_dsixgrs	1	*	And it is one of those countries where the women are often far more attractive than the men.  It is funny how nature does that.

t1_dsi3lbp	0	*	Time for The Running Man.
t1_dsi60vn	1	*	The country pretty much means that too. There is an industry built around it.
t1_dshzejf	0	*	The USA did something similar for every example listed on this thread. And that's the answer to what line the Russians have to cross : one the usa hasn't already crossed. 
t1_dsizkkx	1	*	Hahahahaha say hi to Vlad for me. 
t1_dsib2az	1	*	Hey, Wait...who started this again?  What lead to Putin and was it us, them, or something else entirely?  I think there was some Germans and maybe some native American Eagles maybe?!
t1_dtkvt1u	1	*	Well I just said what I heard him say in an interview. That's all I'm saying

t1_dtkwv1q	0	*	Citizens United: five Republican justices voted for unlimited corporate money spent on elections. Four Democratic justices voted against. It's quite clear who has been bought here. 
t1_dtkuq70	0	*	Read the oral arguments of Citizens United.

t1_dtkw29s	0	*	By % middle class gets a larger cut. Of course people who pay more get a larger total dollar cut. I support their tax cut too.   Why tax success? 
t1_dte6gik	1	*	Russia took Crimea and eastern Ukraine because Chevron wanted to expand NATO into Ukraine so they could make a couple $B/year in fracking profits.  
t1_dtehhre	1	*	95% of Crimea are Russians. And they voted to be with Russia.  50% situation or so you have in Eastern Ukraine (and that's pretty hard given that you have the other 50%)
t1_dte0ewq	1	*	I find that statement ironic considering how much territory America took from Mexico. 
t1_dte2da7	1	*	> leases   Key word here.
t1_dtdp8mq	0	*	*If* they attack the US, it'll be because an Orange Idiot keeps trolling a mentally unstable dictator, instead of listening to his diplomats/experts on what course would benefit the US best.

t1_dt26y9k	0	*	You're grossly generalising all Wahhabists. Some of them just don't like kites.
t1_dt4948s	1	*	It's relevent, as it's against the implication of Islam being the cause of problems such as the one above.

t1_dtstbvu	1	*	man, we are so lucky to be able to sit behind our computers in point blame. 
t1_dtrxkm8	1	*	It can both be true, gangs do well in poorer countries because there is always a steady supply of recruits. 
t1_dtrzegv	1	*	Probably one of the better, really, if you think about it. 
t1_dtrzkns	1	*	Fuck em all to death!  edit: it's a fucking south park refence, wow
t1_dub2rec	1	*	Exactly, it seems pretty easy to ship guns back and forth over the borders, so if you cut the supply on one side it will start running from the other.

t1_duxvuof	1	*	If all you do is laugh,  that will foster a sense of complacency. This is not a good thing. Real dictatorships have started off being laughed at before and turned into something monstrous anyway.

t1_dv1f4vv	0	*	It all sounds like a rather sad must do this must do that way of life. And then you die.  But hey, you do what you do.  Careful of that heart attack though.  
t1_dv0u9m6	0	*	I would love to have a 40 hour work week. Mine usually sways between 50-90 hours each week. Depending on if it's the busy season or not for the business I'm in. 
t1_dv0vouy	0	*	And Obama made you do that?  The answer is of course no, but I've learned not to talk to Americans too much about your insane political nonsense, so I'll just let it go.

t1_dtrca90	0	*	I disagree. When a backup can perform better than the starter and take a team to the superbowl and win, he needs more recognition than being just a backup. The backup just won superbowl MVP.

t1_dtr5gvx	1	*	Honestly I'm kinda glad that it didn't end up like the Saints/Vikings game. I don't think my heart could have handled that.

t1_du3uhfk	1	*	Russia is not part of our political process. Are you really that dense?
t1_dsk9eb8	0	*	But then LEARNED he was wrong. Just like many people were doing back then. He was scared of something because he didn't understand it but he changed his mind and the world didn't explode.

t1_dsrhqd9	0	*	Not nearly as much you think. 
t1_dsq3dbd	1	*	pretty much as most money is fiat its backed by IOU's so to pay off the debt for making the money they need to print, this devalues the currency and creates the same cycle.

t1_dui3bil	1	*	Smoke and mirrors, fake news! ^/s  Honestly China is pretty bad, but they know that destroying the environment is a bad idea, unlike Donald duck over there.
t1_duixjlm	1	*	In July the US corn crop produces as much as 40% more oxygen per acre than the Amazon rainforest.  Not really relevant, but something I found interesting after I learned about it.

t1_ds1b065	0	*	Mental stability =/= regime stability...duh?
t1_ds3c85s	1	*	That would be the security dilemma. I would argue that a lot of proliferation in the Middle East happened that way, especially considering how America let Israel obtain WMDs.

t1_ds15gs1	1	*	And risk even slightly pissing off China?  Yeah I don't think so.
t1_ds1oree	1	*	There is no reason for anyone to downvote you for asking a legitimate question. Weird that a rude response to your question gets upvotes, too. Reddit can be weird.
t1_ds18tiz	0	*	The nukes dont need to be very accurate. It just needs to get in the general area of Los Angeles or some other big city to do major damage 
t1_ds16as7	1	*	to be fair, the UN sections try to target industries that are explicitly state-owned (like petroleum), in which case the revenue would go to the elite and wouldn't be relevant to the poor.
t1_ds1286g	1	*	Not so odd when they have the exact same agenda.
t1_ds19nhp	1	*	I know korean missionaries go out to rescue them from China and get them safe travels through the southern Asian countries until they can get a boat or plane to s. Korea
t1_ds18u2z	1	*	America already destroyed their country once before.
t1_ds16570	1	*	Well it is America's fault. We almost had a nuclear free NK in the Clinton administration, but the US didn't follow through on its end of the deal with NK so they started their nuclear program again. 
t1_ds198rx	0	*	Shh... just let the Russian agent spread his propaganda. Otherwise he might commit suicide one might with 3 bullets to the back of the head.

t1_ds170xs	0	*	Holy shit, you can't possibly be suggesting that I'm characterizing NK.
t1_ds14siq	0	*	Even with our close ties to America we are still better looked after financially by China. Honnestly I'm pissed we follow the states in the territory dispute. 
t1_ds27p33	1	*	Oh ok then, we should let North Korea have power parity with us then, and not destroy them before they can actually land a killer blow. /s
t1_ds1mgld	1	*	So youd fire the missile over South Korea? Or over or on a path very close to China and/or Russia, whose support you depend on to exist?  Look at a map.

t1_dse209o	1	*	I mean, yes that's the easy answer. But the Russians like having Chomskey on RT, saying critical things about the US. Its a way for them to poke the US in the eye. 
t1_du4bwlc	0	*	It's not a dictatorship because they don't have a dictator. Their form of government is a single state socialist republic.
t1_du2mcm8	0	*	China is nominally Communist. Their economic boom was a result of free market reforms.  They kept the authoritarian dictatorship, however.

t1_dv3qt28	0	*	Indictments don't prove anything. That's why we have trials. If you think the indictments prove anything, then frankly, you are un-American because those charged haven't had any due process.

t1_dsbg4fx	1	*	I was actually okayish with the inserts. Its the birds, frogs and mice that did it. 
t1_dtxgem4	1	*	It is very difficult to rise up now.  Some governments could wipe out the entire populace now days if they decided to.
t1_dtx2xww	1	*	Yeah, we should actually vote for governments that couldn't give a fuck.

t1_dss0yac	1	*	Yeah, it's insane that the US is still so high up (#3) despite that
t1_dsqw5yx	1	*	I never suggested I was surprised. You really think this is the first time I've seen someone say something critical about the US, and proceed to get downvoted by angry Americans?
t1_dsr4v8x	0	*	Eh. If we're talking nature, plenty of countries do lack such diverse natural beauties. Portugal is nice but good luck getting the same level of nature diversity. 
t1_dsr9kzc	1	*	Actually no it isn't that bad.  It is just really expensive and if you catch a commuter train to work it can be quite busy.  Other than that it is quite reliable.

t1_dtcjqj2	1	*	How about the 13% sales tax on top of a carbon tax?
t1_dtbxor0	0	*	Things like not adding a handling fee and a booking fee and selling tickets at face value only or they get a fine of say 10k if they do not but not just ticket master and make ticket touts illegal.

t1_duhu941	1	*	Are you crazy? 300 dollars should be enough money to feed one person for a month.
t1_duhyymd	0	*	He's also, by today's standards, very racist, but [his ideas about differences between races](https://lkyonrace.wordpress.com/) led him to use affirmative action pragmatically. Interesting chap.
t1_duiimg6	1	*	It's possible, but it's very expensive out there. Good luck in trying to buy a house though.
t1_duil9n3	1	*	Nationally, of course we'll never see a surplus. Oregon is in America. Oregonians are Americans. It's not un-American.

t1_dui2tc4	0	*	Per month? If so, that's not easily. Blowing 70% of your income on housing. 
t1_dui7na2	1	*	It's not as bad as all that. There is still affordable housing available, it's getting scarcer, but it's still possible. The next generation are going to really struggle.
t1_duill6r	1	*	...Malays are the indigenous ethnic group of Singapore. Indians are often citizens.

t1_dtgenqs	1	*	The thing about dark humor is that it needs to be more than just dark, it has to actually be funny. That joke was low effort and not funny, which makes it just dark and distasteful. 
t1_dsqqixj	0	*	Enough that you're probably hip deep in it.
t1_dtsq58a	1	*	What even is your argument...? Yes and that's why a normal person doesn't cross the road without looking. They realise there is a higher than normal chance of dying and then avoid it.
t1_dtt7qex	0	*	Nice joke. The federal government has multiple times deployed the army and federal police when state police was too corrupt to deal with the issue

t1_dto0zi3	0	*	Unless its a nuclear power. Then even America might hesitate. They'll defend Canada for sure but invade say Russia? Are you positive the US would accept nuclear strikes to their mainland?

t1_dto98de	1	*	Lovely rant though you missed one branch of the military, the Coast Guard.

t1_dtpepm7	0	*	Jokes aside, I heard it was a lot colder than normal over there, so I'm not sure.
t1_dto3xoq	1	*	This administration would release a statement saying Canada was asking for it if Russia attacked.   Grab 'em by the poutine.

t1_dtnzkdj	1	*	Unless it's the US doing the attacking. 
t1_dtoarsu	1	*	Unless it's a conflict that's over keeping the Northwest Passage an international waterway. Then America won't lift a finger.  
t1_dtoooov	1	*	What's the story behind this lol
t1_dtobx0s	1	*	Why would Russia fight back against Russia though? 
t1_dto9bwn	1	*	Well, unless the president was Trump and the aggressor, Russia.
t1_dtp3uv2	1	*	Hudsons Bay is Canada pointing at its dick.
t1_dto78ni	1	*	Also we need you as a buffer in case Russia tries to attack the Americas. 
t1_dtocj11	1	*	I have a hard time believing that the commander of the military gives a shit about that at the moment, where's the dollar signs for him?
t1_dto7x9h	1	*	Im mostly a pacifist, but this just gave me a chub.   Seriously, I hope you write stuff. You write good and shit.

t1_dtoa8zj	0	*	Yeah for Swiss-Canadian dual nationality!
t1_dtodp7n	1	*	Then maybe Trudeau needs to stop throwing so much shade at the country that will have his back if the shit hits the fan.
t1_dto7gqh	1	*	Especially when they have spent decades preparing for thermonuclear war 
t1_dtog297	1	*	But there are 5 branches of the U.S. military...
t1_dto1txb	1	*	No, a lot of Americans do that.  it's actually pretty common.  
t1_dtoby71	1	*	Plus the entire commonwealth. And maybe even China.
t1_dtoel03	1	*	Unless that entity happened to be Russia and our current administration happened to be in office.

t1_dto698f	1	*	Hahah user name checks out.  
t1_dtobgpb	1	*	Canada would apologize to the attacker in the end.
t1_dtobbgl	1	*	You say that, but Trump/Russia? Doubtful he'd do anything.
t1_dto2le7	1	*	Amen. 
t1_dtocv7q	0	*	What shed did Canada steal
t1_dtoag9c	1	*	ok guys, let us know how that feels in 20 years when china actually owns literally all property and companies in can
t1_dtoml5o	1	*	Thats okay, we'll just make a treaty where the US gets to police it and they get the best deal out of it but Canada still benefits monetarily from everyone else.
t1_dtobcm6	1	*	Man, I admire his respect for the enemy here, but even there he shows what an extraordinarily inept man he was at understanding logistics and supply lines.

t1_dtnys3g	1	*	Nah, it makes the US Mexico's giant forehead.
t1_dtnzul7	1	*	New England generally has the reputation for being the most unfriendly region of the U.S., so I'm not surprised that you view it that way.
t1_dtobo1f	1	*	It's pucture of hus duck 
t1_dtobmpa	1	*	Solid advice 
t1_dtoav35	0	*	Trump & Co. would let it do whatever it wants because RUS has that administration by the balls.

t1_dto6h26	1	*	Can I crash in your embassy if shit goes sideways?
t1_dtnzioz	1	*	That's fair. I suppose what I mean is that any group of people will have at least a couple idiots in it, no matter how hard you sift
t1_dtocq6m	0	*	I'm just speaking in general. It's not unheard of like in this case so just isn't anything to worry about.

t1_dsoa1s6	1	*	Fixed it for ya.   So the influx of normies is enough to sway favor towards a perspective by about 20 pts. Sounds easy to understand

t1_du86nod	1	*	To be pedantic taxation to use a vehicle on the road with those taxes going to the maintaining of those roads and bridges is the first type of taxation humans came up with. Poll tax.

t1_dura3wn	0	*	Im trying to understand what youre getting at. Do you think that brainwashed women cant be raped? 
t1_durkc5z	1	*	Jesus, the guy was an IRL Ramsay Bolton.  Its just a shame that his death wasnt as cathartic.
t1_dur8155	1	*	They also get paid like 800k by the SK government for defecting, so there's that incentive to spread propaganda as well.
t1_dur8ztw	1	*	Some people may be willing to have sex with a demigod *pro bono*.
t1_duqn4u3	0	*	Maybe start by ending the largest military drill in the world where they pretend to invade the North twice a year. The hell do you think made them so pissed off?

t1_duq93nq	1	*	Search for Gippeumjo or 'pleasure squad' and Kim Jong Un or North Korea, there are a few articles to pick from but may or may not be from the sources you're looking for.
t1_duqkmqf	1	*	and that's why they make up stories. If they have a hard time making money from anything other than shit-talking NK, that's all they'll do.  You can't trust defectors.

t1_dv2v6mn	1	*	But they voted for him in the first place, and he ran as a protectionist. And they still overwhelmingly support him. 
t1_dv2tkkz	0	*	So you are saying the 500 pt drop that coincided with Trump's tweets had nothing to do with the tweet... just everyone decided now is a time to sell their stock to reduce leverage.  Right?
t1_dv2tagh	0	*	> Try to lay off the emotional appeals for a second. I myself am a Dem  If only the Dems would do this, maybe we could discuss actual policy on something.

t1_dv2o9fs	1	*	I could use some thoughts and prayers, too.
t1_dv2t8bo	1	*	the fed talking about raising interest rates can cause markets to fall.  Thats just the nature of markets and speculators.  the president talking about tariffs absolutely will make speculators react.
t1_dv2utx1	1	*	You can't really worry about that shit, there is no winning. If they don't like the news, no source will be good enough. If they do like it, they will happily link you NYT or WaPo or CNN.

t1_dv2pl25	1	*	I downvoted him

t1_dv2onr0	0	*	he is hard in a Russian prostitute.  did I do it right?
t1_dv2p0nz	1	*	I approve of your sarcasm level, but not really. Mostly, trade wars are about most people not understanding economics worth a damn.

t1_dv2hnrr	1	*	I don't even know what you want to say. 
t1_dv2tcgl	0	*	You will lose once more if Trump manages to convince the states that voted Red that he is doing a great job. That is unfortunately the result of your electoral system. 
t1_dv2r05b	1	*	Bernie wasn't going to win dude. He's not the savior you think he his btw. 
t1_dv2nnw1	1	*	Who are you responding to?
t1_dv2r59j	1	*	Ive been persuaded drill isnt worth the cost of maintenance. Professionalism is best gained via events and general recruitment. 
t1_dv2nn6p	1	*	Yes, because it now seems trump want to take the guns away
t1_dv2ueaj	1	*	He's going to jail and will die there. Panama won't be an option.
t1_dv2o14o	1	*	Its a better thing when there isnt an election.  TPP is going ahead with or without the US. Shame for the US to step back from global institutions after so many decades building them.

t1_dv2njp8	0	*	Yup, and the shareholders will enjoy that very much as they invest none of it back in the business and still lay people off.
t1_dv2o1r9	0	*	Do you have any reason why we should believe you?
t1_dv2oafw	1	*	then get your voting system fixed
t1_dv2vsh5	1	*	Okay but again, the majority of our steel imports are from Canada and the majority of our steel exports are to Canada. Explain how this is something China is going to suffer from.
t1_dv2tfr1	0	*	Oh no, lol, the horror 
t1_dv2ro02	1	*	To be fair, we as people are easy to forget the big picture whenever there's a breaking news happening. For example, any gun related mass murder. 
t1_dv2r9pa	1	*	Maybe not as many? And most definitely not with as much power as the USA

t1_duvwi1p	0	*	It is an extreme weather event, and it is unheard of in history isn't it? And if you look at the latest NASA animation there isn't any old ice left. It's concerning.
t1_duvy1gy	1	*	So, I should start picking up after my dog shits in my neighbors yard? Got it.  -I dont actually do that.

t1_duwe8vf	0	*	I havent seen that long a list in a while where I wasnt tempted to click on a single one. The length of it made my blood run cold and Im sure its not even complete.

t1_duw5p71	1	*	Don't want to argue with turbo farts! Learnt my lesson last time
t1_duw532w	1	*	You wouldn't believe how complex these things are to understand.  I thought the science was just all mumbo jumbo.

t1_duwksml	0	*	the bible also talks about a woman craving donkey dicks, doesn't mean we should take it seriously.
t1_duw43n3	0	*	No, it doesn't. I would maybe concede logarithmic. We're not going thermonuclear here. At least not due to atmospheric composition.
t1_duwjb49	1	*	I think its 1) overwhelming 2) hard to grasp 3) too much is unknown/hard to predict 
t1_duw1q2f	0	*	Climate change was a term Republican shill Frank Luntz got the public to use in lieu of global warming, because it sounded less scary.
t1_duwjqor	1	*	Vegan just means no animals were abused for the product. Is it so beyond the realm of comprehension that it warrants a moment of pause to reflect?!
t1_duw81yc	1	*	Sounds like the beginning of Interstellar. Well without the fancy space missions that is.
t1_duwado0	1	*	I think reading any more comments are gonna be downhill after this one.  So I'll call it off, cheers.

t1_dtrh973	0	*	Are trolling or dumb? Iraq constantly abuses its Kurd population. Also Christians make up one in every 10 people in the Middle East.
t1_du767pk	0	*	But, he told me that he was Chevy Chase and I'm not.
t1_du7612y	1	*	Because a British king and the Catholic church both put the apostles words in their totally-perfect-nope-dont-question-it book.
t1_du75zr5	0	*	Sure I agree with you there. My point is that homosexuality being a sin is hardly an uncommon or incorrect thing to interpret when reading the Bible. 
t1_dtx0chj	0	*	Wouldn't sanctions make them more self reliant?  Which isn't that what we don't want? I don't know, honest question.
t1_duyli8b	1	*	What's the difference? 
t1_dsd6i2m	1	*	 Because they actually made sense? Various countries have various pay grades based on their cost of living and special circumstance like hazard pay for people working in the middle east? 
t1_dv4ah8p	0	*	Beat me to it.  Yes, soldiers kill people that attack them. It's kind of exactly what they are trained to do.
t1_ds70n5x	0	*	The UN has recognized that the abuse and violence those refugees experienced in their transit of Egypt means that it is not considered a 'safe country' for the purpose of that determination.

t1_duuveim	1	*	Antarctica is more resilient thanks to the cold water current that circles around it: preventing warm air from migrating too far south.
t1_duvgvb1	1	*	Hey, it's not normally 30 degrees F at night here! 
t1_duuxjo0	1	*	Ridiculous argument ... Livestock production is an industry. The point is that a significant percentage of methane release comes from the astronomical scale of our livestock production industry.

t1_duuwxcv	1	*	Man, I can see why you guys don't have any potatoes.

t1_ds2oo2d	1	*	The government of Israel has apologised because it was their citizens who committed the crime. That's diplomacy 101.
t1_ds1t1u1	1	*	Doubt it
t1_ds1tdgw	0	*	Why is annexing the land a bad thing? Isnt what everyone complains about the fact that Israel treats Palestinians worse than its own citizens? 
t1_ds1q21u	1	*	You mean like when they provide the clean water and power for the region? 
t1_ds220xn	0	*	Those peace treaties came into existence after they attacked Israel and lost. Its not like they just spontaneously wrote themselves one day over a cup of tea.

t1_duu72yt	1	*	Why dont your elected officials do something about that?.. Oh, i see.
t1_dslq0yr	0	*	Does China recognize any of the atrocities it perpetrated against its own population? We killed nearly a million Japanese civilians, it was war.

t1_dt2mh73	1	*	Poll taken at an Atheist Protest in front of a Mega Church...
t1_dt2r164	1	*	Do they not have gods of their own?
t1_dt2jv0n	1	*	And being well educated makes you less likely to be religious,
t1_dt2zwdc	1	*	And evolution anyone that doesn't at this point is facking stupid because even the pope officially said that evolution exists
t1_dt2l71i	1	*	jokes on you our economy and stock markets are thriving! and the jokes on us because we have trump as president and our government shut down! jokes on everybody!
t1_dt2tdv0	0	*	What exactly do you mean when you say that you believe in the big bang theory?
t1_dt2o5bv	0	*	Theres another theory: some guys wrote what they thought happened 
t1_dt2q8ud	0	*	Its called deism,  god creates physics and science and then the universe just forms. He creates stuff then takes his hands off. 
t1_dt2mwh6	0	*	Young earth creationists in general have no problem with dinosaurs. Not sure where you got that from
t1_dt2nn35	1	*	Yeah, the Big Bang Theory was proposed by a Belgian Catholic priest Georges Lemaxeetre. Science answers how, whereas Religion answers why, the two are not mutually exclusive.
t1_dt2tcee	1	*	What is the whole elastic theory
t1_dt2k46w	1	*	You voted in a comedian... granted i liked him, but you don't have much room to talk
t1_dt2j4cj	0	*	This is still a controversial issue within the Church, arguments of personal agency aside.
t1_dt2lfdj	1	*	> Most young people in America are agnostic or atheist.  Source?

t1_dt2m75s	0	*	Well then that must mean that nobody does.
t1_dt2lrpk	1	*	Damn, thanks
t1_dt2ma3i	1	*	It's hard to sound intelligent when a vast number of people here say af is an acronym, rather than an initialism. 
t1_dt2ks4y	1	*	Maybe they only polled people who don't believe in the Bible creation story instead of polling people randomly. U0001f914
t1_dt2mnxp	1	*	There are very few U.S. cities I would want to live in in the United States over Reykjavik. Your taste may vary.
t1_dt2mb78	1	*	Lookin at you Rodrigo Borgia
t1_dt4vmjc	1	*	No proof for anything supernatural occurring ever. Also, no sound logical arguments for any good claim either.

t1_dt2jju5	1	*	4% is not as interesting a headline as 0% though
t1_dt2p2x8	1	*	I focused on Biochemistry, Orgo, and Bio. Fuck physics. I doubt most of those grad students can really visualize it anyway.
t1_dt2k72v	1	*	Yeah the 8 years before Trump was a huge shit show. Glad things are getting back to normal. 
t1_dt2kxd9	0	*	> It was somewhere around 140.   You have source on this? Article claims there are no details on it, and the link to the study is pretty devoid of detail.

t1_dt2o26n	1	*	Raised Catholic. Never anyone told me the earth is 6000 years old or that what  I was learning at school was wrong. 
t1_dt2kni9	1	*	In other words, religion had to incorporate science to sound credible.

t1_dt2n0bt	0	*	> It's not meant to be taken literally (i.e. Earth created in 6 days yes or no?).  Funny how Christians seemingly pick and choose what is literal and what isnt
t1_dt32fgq	0	*	You just insulted people based on religious views, don't act like you're unbiased. 
t1_dt2josj	1	*	This is not the funniest comment but its probably the right one. 
t1_dt2jubb	1	*	Don't worry by the time all is said and done, most comedians will have material for the next 50 years. 
t1_dt2hw7r	1	*	Yes
t1_dt2jaik	1	*	They might be. This study doesn't say. Most Christians don't believe in that story either.
t1_dt2pl54	1	*	Redshift, blueshift.  Lots of data.  Still much we dont know.  Throwing a Middle Eastern fairy tale in as an explanation really bad idea.  
t1_dt2jns2	1	*	Then why bother with the rest of it? We don't read the first half of a biology book and say oh those were some good stories, now the rest is all super true though.
t1_dt2lchp	0	*	Close, but it is 1,000 years not just 1 year. 
t1_dt2m4ag	1	*	Yeah but that's not how statistics work. Their sample size was definitely too small. This very article was debated over on /r/atheism last week.
t1_dt2l6mq	1	*	They probably just asked a group 15 or 20 teenagers. There's more people in Sacramento, California than there is in all of Iceland.
t1_dt2p51w	1	*	Sign me up 
t1_dt2jp1p	0	*	I know. I don't understand how a guy who [looks like this] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Bj%C3%B6rnsson_Arnold_Classic_2017.jpg) is agile enough for basketball.  Edit: autocorrect
t1_dt2l4po	0	*	IIRC, Catholicism officially holds that, while the Young Earth model is possible, it's far from certain, and further, that we should take science seriously.
t1_dt2qht8	1	*	I'm from Iceland and I know a guy who is in the xc1satrxfaafxe9lag mainly because he didn't want the state church to get his tax money, and he though this was funnier.
t1_dtezvsd	0	*	To believe is not the same thing as to know. How can you equate belief to knowledge?

t1_du7gkjf	0	*	They don't give all that money away for nothing. You get influence in return.   It's pretty clear that Trump is building a wall around the US. 
t1_dspa5d5	0	*	And the fact that this is pretty much common as shit in Mexico.
t1_duy6z9z	1	*	You would have to make the fed give the land away. Most of the country is federal land, and despite the US's problems, it isn't nearly as stupid as South Africa.
t1_duy5c3h	0	*	Everyone who disagrees with me is racist is the new, everyone who disagrees with me is Hitler
t1_duy5y2e	0	*	I see you have never heard of Canada. We still use a ton of .303. Parts of our military just stopped using it last year.
t1_dsh9p64	0	*	Yeah, the issue was the 24000 attempts were made on the parliament networks within the building and using government owed vpns that are strictly for business 
t1_dsdat92	0	*	Where do you work? Unless you're like at a manual labor job, almost every office job will have dead time where there's nothing to do.

t1_dsd9rsz	1	*	Srsly, these fucking clickbait articles with no substance -.-   So, you're telling me, pretty much everyone can use this network, so what's the point of this figure? And the misleading title.
t1_dsdcyek	1	*	Drain the swamp, drain the swamp!
t1_dsd9i9z	1	*	Doesn't this specifically refer to requests made on site?  Nobody cares if you're looking at porn at home, but while you're actively at work is another thing entirely. 
t1_dsdad9b	1	*	Which makes it an entirely false and irresponsible news article. Journalism has fallen so far from grace.
t1_dsdb7mb	1	*	Would also apply, mine is more of 'we can, you can't', which is how it usually works, a set of rules for them and a set for everynone else, theirs just happens to be aggravatingly lenient.
t1_ds2ma8n	0	*	Bibi accepted small gifts and isn't running a repressive totalitarian state. Please with the solidarity.
t1_ds2xafb	1	*	Eh, powerful politicians do get put away in Israel, but law enforcement doesn't move on it without an incredibly solid case.

t1_duq6zq0	0	*	Why go to college when you can just browse reddit
t1_dupms7z	1	*	Not too much about it's lifecycle, but it sounds like it floats around eating bacteria in ponds.  It's more common in murky/disturbed water and factories because of readily available food.

t1_duvhno2	0	*	You can't unscramble an egg. 
t1_dumvs0w	0	*	They kill over neighborhoods far poorer than most in the US.  They sell drugs to the poor throughout Mexico.  There is profit in selling to the poor.  
t1_dunlb6l	1	*	Tell that to the disgraced AG Holder.
t1_dumbqzg	1	*	It's not expensive. It's cheap, otherwise they wouldn't do it. Remember that the goal of drugs isn't grams but effect. If the effect per $ is less for one drug than another, then it's cheaper. 
t1_dt413ne	0	*	It looks pretty consistent. Google.

t1_dtry7ir	0	*	I wouldn't. They are flawed, yes, but trying to improve themselves. The success of that is debatable. 
t1_dts1kd9	1	*	No this wasn't always the case.  It's been like that for a long time, but if you go back to age of your grandparents it was completely different.
t1_dtqnsha	1	*	Thanks for sharing your family's story. It's very humbling to hear what people will do to live in a country I was lucky enough to simply be born in.

t1_dtqha4k	0	*	Oh come on. You can't say anything nice about legal immigrants because illegal ones exist?
t1_dtqnizk	0	*	It's not that strict for refugees though who can then immigrate more easily.  Also construction work is a desired profession I believe.  It's not all white collar immigration

t1_dtqxrc0	0	*	Why is it alt right to praise strict immigration? It's funny though cause  you're praising it saying it makes Canada more educated, does that make you alt right? What a ridiculous comment.
t1_dtr46qi	1	*	Id rather not. And the way people are voting, I wont have to. 
t1_dtqeq4h	1	*	As a percent of population, Canada has more immigrants than the US
t1_dtrx83y	1	*	I think it's key to be realistic about the immigrant situation in Canada. The evidence suggests that Canada is better for their immigration, regardless of legal status. 
t1_dtqzpe3	0	*	> D) Language barriers with countries who ~~doesn't~~ don't use english as their main language.  I'm definitely being pedantic here, but in the context of what you're arguing it had to be corrected.
t1_dtq83em	1	*	Can i have a source for that?
t1_dtuo5qk	0	*	Maybe not but their traditional culture is slowly fading away as well. So how is it really that relevant to immigration?
t1_duq4bu8	1	*	Oh for sure. The kids did better than him. Specifically the one who went down holding the door for others. He couldn't even manage to hold a door or usher kids for several minutes. 
t1_dt9nt5m	1	*	Wasn't he like 13 when the Nazis surrendered?

t1_dsf7jac	1	*	What did conservative news outlets say about Obamas children?   
t1_dsf6m7v	0	*	No. That's not how any of this works.   Your outrage doesn't grant you permission to harass people.
t1_duoznuh	1	*	Except it did no damage. In Russia people expect higher ups to be rich of their power. By our logic, who wouldn't?
t1_dsqpvmq	1	*	no, they just understand Politics, economics, and how they work in context in modern Democracy.
t1_dsr2oey	1	*	Yep, they hire people to be involved in politics.
t1_dsr78w3	1	*	For now.
t1_duhdbg1	1	*	Of course, I totally agree. Bibi and his wife are terrible people. Even so, you can't send them to jail until a court conviction.

t1_dsty7ji	0	*	Maybe putting a little fear into their hearts is exactly what they need. Then again, maybe that would just make them more oppressive towards the rest of humanity.

t1_dug1ztg	1	*	Exactly my point. Mechanically, it all comes down to maintenance. It doesn't really matter the plane. Sure, newer planes may have higher tolerances but push *any* plane hard enough and it will fail.

t1_du5d79m	0	*	Every country deserves a Hitler to learn from. 
t1_du5cx9n	1	*	> no, we are not like the US used to be ever.  You would be surprised. A bunch of areas had so many germans that there were plenty of towns with German as the dominant language until WWI.
t1_du5cg3b	1	*	That's an oversimplification. The views on immigration in Germany are very similar to those in the US, as is the fight on government overreach.
t1_du56ay8	0	*	This is not about fleecing Facebook but to have sanctions in place that can not be shrugged off as was the case in the past.

t1_du572zl	1	*	The argument isn't exactly that it's too long and therefor not binding but that you basically can't put stuff in there which isn't to be expected in a usual EULA. 
t1_du59n6a	1	*	Indeed, but the US just makes it legal then, like bribery.

t1_dt0g74h	1	*	Yeah, we know small-minded folk will blame more than a billion people for incidents like this.
t1_dt0g7ir	1	*	But the guy chose the punishment. He'd rather get beaten with sticks than go to jail. 
t1_ds9okib	1	*	That's the reality of it, but Trump is definitely advocating for it although as you say, this wouldn't actually happen.
t1_dtblm37	0	*	Ok but yeah, I don't think it's about logic, Rick. I-I think the word has just become a symbolic issue for powerful groups that feel like they're doing the right thing. - Morty

t1_dusy5iq	0	*	Well if so, congrats, and you have the right to bitch about oil executives.
t1_duskm1e	1	*	No, the time for preventative measures has past, now its just trying to keep the positive feedback loops from running their course in 20 years. The time for your suggestions was back in 2000.

t1_du1wclk	0	*	The way Americans damaged the US  reputation by electing Dubya, twice  /FTFY
t1_du1cnyp	1	*	I prefer cheeto over cantaloupe. Cantaloupes are fruit, they're healthy, and the contents of Trump's head are anything but healthy. Cheetos, on the other hand, are fat and salty.
t1_du3fago	0	*	We're not old. Just wait another 30 years.
t1_du11t23	1	*	> So you're telling me that every other world leader or representative stood up for every other country in the world? Yea, okay.  Uhhhh is this your first Olympic games?
t1_du18tz5	1	*	The key word here is supposed.
t1_du11v0t	1	*	As opposed to a 'lovely' nation. I know which I'd rather deal with.  People are annoying but nations are dangerous.
t1_du146wg	0	*	So that wasn't important to you? You don't care about the first president to support gay marriage during his campaign? I will stand for the rights of all mankind. Where do you stand?
t1_du16tal	0	*	Well, Americans torture and execute Muslims.
t1_du0zzv3	0	*	You seem to be the one drinking the kool-aid in this situation.

t1_du2hxde	1	*	You're picking the guy that has visited a shrine that has glorified Japan's actions in World War II and has enshrined war criminals in it?
t1_du0vk2n	0	*	I would bet good money that every other politician sent there stood up for a least one other country aside from their own.
t1_du1chmz	0	*	Your argument makes no sense.... You believe that the American VP should stand for other countries, but American citizens shouldn't have to stand for America
t1_du16j7w	0	*	Elaborate like I'm five.

t1_dux8z8g	1	*	to the extent of japan? In a so called developed country?Nope. I've also lived in USA and South Korea. Never had too many issues there.
t1_dspmcck	1	*	So that's why the German went throught the Ardennes! They didn't want to damage the bridge in Strasbourg. How considerate of them.
t1_dspo7o4	1	*	E.g. hanging two bridges from the same bolt, instead of one.
t1_dsphqaw	1	*	It's fine. Lots of screaming
t1_dspyh8c	1	*	hurr it was just a joke!  Fuck off.
t1_dspr2ia	1	*	You must have been one clever baby! 
t1_dsqc0hj	1	*	Seriously?   The Hyatt Regency walkway collapse resulted in 114 fatalities and 216 non-fatal injuries.    It would be the deadliest structural collapse in the US until 9/11. 
t1_dspolwp	1	*	Looks like the US is moving in this direction.
t1_dspor73	1	*	It's been that long?! Holy cow. I remember seeing the news reports on TV.

t1_dspofyz	1	*	Lol if you have to go to the physical exchange floor you arnt a billionaire
t1_dsqaqld	1	*	I think the title is intentionally ambiguous so that people are simultaneously reading two separate catastrophes, so that whether you value money or people more, you will click that link. 
t1_dspwxmm	1	*	Just reading that was rough. Egads.  Then, the memorial company spelled several victim's names wrong.  . . . You have one job, people.

t1_dsppgbk	1	*	I'm really worried about a bear market. I can't run very fast. 
t1_dspo33r	1	*	Government contracts are often awarded based on who pays the largest bribe in SE Asia, which is kind of the definition of not playing by the rules when it comes to awarding contracts by tender.
t1_dsprdb3	1	*	Damn, as an Indonesian, my country seems to be deep in the trench
t1_dspwnjl	1	*	Just one floor. In fact, based on the article seems like somehow no one died there. Who knows about the injured though.
t1_dspv5cu	1	*	ditto
t1_dsq4kxe	1	*	Pretty ballsy, sourcing your quotes from jesus.  (Next time, put an enter or two after the quote before you write anything else, reddit stops the quote there)

t1_dv2n0rd	0	*	My feet hurt just from reading that sentence.
t1_dv2ligc	1	*	Were never running out of oil. Theres more untapped oil deposits found than we have ever drilled & extracted in total. Its all about environmental impact, not so much the available supply. 
t1_dv2k80r	0	*	plenty to go around...yet previously, at some point it gets pricier  With respect, are you sure you have it worked out there? 
t1_dv2mk6g	0	*	They're also edible. Check how auto manufacturers are doing with their genius idea. http://www.synlube.com/IncredibleEdibleCar1.htm
t1_dv2hui8	1	*	I also wonder if it would cause deforestation to clear way for more farms.  I doubt there is a bunch of sugar cane sitting around going bad.
t1_dv2lbg6	1	*	And will they still be hard and sharp enough to work like Roman caltrops when scattered on the floor? I'd be disappointed if stepping on one didn't disable my foot for at least several days. 
t1_dv2wf0v	1	*	Dude, I am 50 years old.  My cousins are now 65.  They had LEGO.  They gave it to me as teenagers.  I kept it.  I gave it to my kids.  Simple story.  Not hard to believe.
t1_dv2n15x	1	*	Yeah their tolerance when they make them is like 0.002 millimeters

t1_dt8zgpc	1	*	It was also destroyed before Palestine existed. 
t1_dt8z5fz	0	*	Yeah that's way better than just being given free fighter jets and bombs. 
t1_dt9r26r	0	*	What is odd about all that is no one rejects the Palestinian claim to Bethlehem - which was also part of the international city in the 1947 partition plan. 
t1_dt9kjs5	1	*	That's anti-semitic
t1_dt90m6q	0	*	More than significant. Overwhelming. There a more Palestinians than Israeli Jews.

t1_dt8ydzf	0	*	Jerusalem wasn't given to anyone, both Jordan and Israel gained control through occupation.
t1_dt8nqvw	0	*	They reseve the right to maintain Israel as a Jewish state. There are no civil marriages allowed and that makes it by nature a theocracy. And I have been to Israel too. 
t1_dt9i5um	0	*	Cut the international aid to Palestinians and dismantle UNRWA, and you'd soon see them signing a peace deal.
t1_dt8y4o9	0	*	So how about we accept that both sides are evil and move on with it.
t1_dt9cska	0	*	> You're all dumb.  resorting to personal attacks, great sign of a strong argument.   
t1_dts3eef	1	*	The very problem of nukes is once you have open the Pandora box there is no coming back and for sure a large scale nuclear war would ruin humanity.   
t1_dt3nony	1	*	Well hell
t1_dsr2q3i	0	*	I believe it was Raid flea and tick (seemed to work on them, too), but I'm also sure it's pretty toxic. 
t1_dsre7em	1	*	I did after the first attack, but all it does is move their next nest a little further away if they keep coming back.
t1_dsqucgp	1	*	In Alaska it's pretty much universal.

t1_duls0kn	0	*	What in the TPP would have had the wheel still under protection?  That's a bit of a ridiculous strawman no?
t1_dumpeav	1	*	Exactly, ask China, they just steal it.

t1_dtrybm8	1	*	Yep same feeling 
t1_dspjkz2	0	*	I don't think you understand the level of gravitas the Queen has in this country. Assassinating her would be a huge blow to national morale.
t1_dtj871d	1	*	>As expressed during our initial review, we have grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memo's accuracy.  That's directly from the Bureau, not a Fox News source.
t1_dsse2bu	0	*	Article is clearly talking about war crimes being committed by moderate rebels and you instantly go: B-but whatabout the Syrian government!!. This is literally whataboutism. Try harder next time.

t1_dsa8ttx	0	*	It's weird. /r/worldnews seems to be completely against this under the grounds that there's no way to actually have a metric for this kind of thing, but are wholly for it if it's aimed at migrants.
t1_dsacwkv	0	*	Bullshit you can disagree all day long. The Government  even doesn't have that a clear stance on most subjects. Hatespeech laws are just for people rallying up lynch mobs.

t1_ds9zmmy	0	*	The stones and trees will say O Muslims, O Abdullah, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him.  Even the dang stones in the Quran are anti semetic, lol.
t1_dsakg77	0	*	i think claiming that germany is taking in 'huge numbers of bigots in an attempt to prove how not bigoted' they are is shoehorning in and of itself.
t1_dsbf6ur	1	*	good thing you aren't a refugee then. i mean they cant deport you anywhere so you good
t1_dsafjlz	0	*	The attack on the synagogue was by drunk refugees from Palestine, that's why it was ruled to be antizionism and not anti-semitism. The perpetrators were displaced by Israel's actions.
t1_ds9zsfj	0	*	Acknowledging the real meaning of a word is not striping anyone of anything.  In English, anti-semitism is not the hatred of Semitic people, that's all. I'm not responsible for how language evolves.

t1_dunxsg3	1	*	I prefer them because they don't condensate all over my desk or cupholders.  But that's not really a good reason to destroy the environment
t1_dunybks	1	*	I didn't seek it out, just walked past one and it was bloody cold, so I got a hot chocolate.  I think it was near alexanderplatz in berlin, so maybe caters to tourists
t1_dunwcv6	0	*	Actually most places in my area use paper cups for all sizes, even large. There's a movie theater by the highway that serves large sodas that are at *least* a litre but they're still paper.
t1_dunxeix	1	*	Its only 3 in Finland. Pretty cheap.
t1_dunvim6	1	*	I was about to say I haven't gotten anything from McDonalds in styrofoam on the east coast, but yeah I think my husband's sweet tea is usually foam.  I've never gotten pancakes.
t1_dunu2v3	1	*	The breakfast plates still have Styrofoam and some locations still have the large Styrofoam drink cup.
t1_dunvods	1	*	It's rare but I still occasionally get foam cups when they run out of plastic ones. 
t1_dunvpyp	1	*	They only recently in my area at least switched from foam cups to paper. The new paper ones suck but I'll deal with it for the earth.. 
t1_dunxho0	1	*	The only things I can remember are the breakfast platters and large tea and soda.
t1_dunwsbv	1	*	They are used for purple drank, and it's double cupped, drank is awful for the environment.

t1_dunxf2l	1	*	The only thing i recall being in foam, were the breakfast platters. I havent seen in of those, since I last worked at McDonalds about 12 years ago.
t1_dunwusv	1	*	Last time I checked, they used Styrofoam for their hotcakes (pancakes), but they might've stopped now; it's been years since I've had hotcakes from McDonald's.
t1_dunyaqn	1	*	Aye!  Does anybody else STILL boycott Chick-Shill-A because of the homophobia of the founder?  I do!

t1_dtn8pre	0	*	So as long as its my choice to make use of a symbol of oppression and degradation then it no longer becomes one? Gotcha! 
t1_dtmve6p	0	*	Saudi princes are secular. Its the people and the imams which pressure the Saudi government that enforce these laws. 
t1_dtn3jaf	0	*	Absolutely. Thanks I feel so glorified. Islam is inherently an Arab religion and I never got why non Arabs are into that shit. 
t1_dtne684	0	*	Hmm, that's very interesting. From your experience, though, do many people still choose to wear the hijab in Oman? 
t1_dtmxc7q	1	*	Seems you're the one pushing an agenda. 
t1_dtnjlta	0	*	Do you even know the back story? She insulted the girl.   How would wanting her to be expelled be a bad thing? When she had no reason to insult? 
t1_dtn2am7	1	*	But posting in a, say, restaurant, is a different thing
t1_dtmvpaf	0	*	Thats probably fake 
t1_dtmlz6q	0	*	At least 90% of Iranian women who live outside of Iran don't wear hijab, and their husbands don't give a shit.

t1_dtmy5rz	0	*	They're too busy banning Milo and the like for having politically incorrect statements.
t1_dtmws46	1	*	It's both.  There's nutjobs who actually believe it, and others use it for power.  The latter uses the former as useful idiots.

t1_dtobkph	1	*	Visited Iran back in 2009.. Can say from experience. my cousin was huge into punk rock.   Fuck the Regime. Fuck the Basij
t1_dtn7fav	1	*	Tell that to the people who say Islam is full of butchers and Christian countries are civilized (those most of these are the same people who think US is a Christian country).
t1_dtn2gey	1	*	If you police what a tourists wears. You are no better than the nazis who murdered in pride of country.
t1_dtmutjk	0	*	Thats how it seems from your perspective as a non-Muslim. Im sure those who wear the hijab voluntarily would disagree.
t1_dtn0pre	1	*	Another perspective is pack survival that brought people together into villages and cities with traditions and stories that turned into organized religion. 
t1_dtmpc74	0	*	Fuck that. Sun's out, gams out. 
t1_dtobov3	1	*	Not ALL opponents!

t1_dsoocyj	1	*	New Zealand in first and Japan in second? Right.
t1_dso3n45	0	*	The USA doesn't have allies. It has client states, colonies built around military bases, and territories that belong to it as Congo belonged to Leopold, America's ideological and spiritual role model.
t1_dsqbj5w	1	*	Never said you didn't. Just saying that Vietnam and Iraq were wars you didn't have to fight in, and you likely wouldn't have lost influence by not fighting in them. 
t1_dsp32c0	1	*	New Zealand?????   Not really high on my list.  They won't let our Navy dock unless it is an emergency
t1_dsopbbx	1	*	You can be our cousin.
t1_dsod3wl	1	*	Then why are you still on Reddit? 
t1_dsofj82	0	*	Tbf the UK doesn't help us out much, when they do it's because we pay them
t1_dsok2ft	1	*	So make a comment explaining why, if you are just going to say you are wrong and not explain why you think that nobody is going to listen to you 
t1_dsp2zlt	1	*	I love France.   Just the stack rank in my head
t1_dsopxjt	0	*	I think it would be fair to count our time with West Germany as well 
t1_duo4378	1	*	Ooh! Can you tell your own government then to mind its own fucking business?
t1_duw8bkv	1	*	Because those shootings almost never happen and are sensationalized to hell.  And also the fact that the second amendment is not the reason they are happening.
t1_duo4jkd	1	*	Damn, my bad. I've seen this unironically used so often, it's registered as a standard canned response in my head.
t1_duogmfj	0	*	Had me going there for a minute... Too many people have proposed this for real.
t1_duo8r42	1	*	> or you would have killed/hurt a petty thief.  Not a concern when they threaten my life.

t1_dunvw4g	1	*	Well shit...
t1_dunwqht	0	*	I would say that attitude exists in many countries though, it just baffles me as an outsider looking in how every time there's a mass shooting its seemingly never a gun control problem.
t1_duoppie	1	*	I was just thinking that so glad someone else was.
t1_dups7kx	1	*	Yeah lmao.  Go into that house and confiscate their guns.  It's a bold strategy, let's see how that works out for them.
t1_duo5k5o	1	*	Yup, and I never understood all the uproar over the NSA data collection, either.  After all, the Fourth doesn't say *anything* about phones or computers.

t1_dupc732	1	*	It would create jobs are curb human trafficking too
t1_duor4w4	1	*	No it aint. But even if it were, its a different crowd saying just mind your own business vs we should investigate how theyre trying to convertly alter the public mindset.
t1_dupnpv0	1	*	Not trying to be a dick, but how is that at all relevant to my comment? If I call my representative, I'm going to get the same treatment. 
t1_dupaazg	1	*	it doesnt seem to work in the usa which are pretty lenient on gun control still.
t1_duodw53	1	*	Having stricter gun control laws, I guess.
t1_dunxiob	0	*	Thats really a terrible way to try and prove your opponent wrong. Because Im against what you want Im a neckbeard? Thats some seriously stupid logic.
t1_dupkapj	1	*	Avoid tu quoque, especially when it is on such shaky grounds.
t1_duon5ny	1	*	You would think we have thousands going out and shooting lots of people.  It is like one or two a year.  Ooooh ban guns change the constitution for .ooooonothing of the population.
t1_dunu6ns	0	*	Norway has had one mass shooting in recorded history. One. Compare that to [the last two months](https://www.massshootingtracker.org/data) in the US.. 
t1_dunlkd0	0	*	Many states already do, mine holds owners responsible if the weapon is not reported stolen. 
t1_duoir8i	0	*	Just brain dead fucking simple huh?   Some one could have ended it sooner!   Teachers should be able to protect their students!   Maybe *the kid having a fucking gun* is the problem? Nah
t1_dup99vz	0	*	No thanks, Adolf. I don't want the government taking away anyone's civil rights.
t1_duno2uu	1	*	The likelihood of completing a task is typically inversely correlated with the difficulty / amount of effort required to complete said task...
t1_dupec17	0	*	Yes and yes.

t1_duprapz	1	*	Yep
t1_dunwtve	1	*	Women are too weak willed and soft brained to ever pull off something like a school shooting. 
t1_duogfne	0	*	School shootings. 
t1_duohua6	1	*	Adding to this Trump is pushing for the banning of bump stocks and increasing the legal age to 21. Too bad there havnt been any articles posted here about it.
t1_dup78np	1	*	Do you think family members of victims should be on jury panels then?
t1_dunzbgb	1	*	Or you could talk about the UK or Australia instead, countries which have a lot more in common with the US than Mexico or Brazil.
t1_duo7nry	1	*	Why would he? Denmark is doing great, and Ixb4m saying that as a Swede.
t1_dsrd40r	1	*	Except, in Norway fur is actually more vital than food in some cases.  It's god awful cold up here.   And yes - synthetic materials are available. But so are alternate food sources.
t1_du4ck75	1	*	Thanks for the answer and not shit flinging
t1_dtjp9p5	1	*	don't forget all the judges. 
t1_dtirwke	1	*	If Obama failed to shut it down, then why doesnt Trump one up him and actually do it?
t1_dtii3lo	1	*	Because they are evil as fuck and have no morals or ethics
t1_dtil3i9	1	*	Yeah the Cuban govt doesn't want to validate the base's existence by accepting the payment. 
t1_dtii0hx	1	*	He is currently trying to purge top law enforcement of secret democrats because they aren't his lapdogs.
t1_dtif9hk	0	*	>Did he actually try to close it?  Can you read?  https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/7/trump_signs_executive_order_to_keep_guantanamo/dti0fge/

t1_dtilobf	0	*	How is prison immoral? Maybe don't be a terrorist?
t1_dtigmim	0	*	tfw a prison colony grows up and makes it's own prison colony.
t1_dtinanr	1	*	I was in Ghana when they were discussing transferring the guantanamo prisoners. I highly doubt any Ghanaians saw a dime of that transaction other than the dude who had just bought a house in dubai
t1_dtisbbw	1	*	They don't have evidence on a lot of them because they just shipped them off to Gitmo because someone in Afghanistan turned them in for a reward.  They shouldn't have been there in the first place.
t1_dtiib86	0	*	Immoral to have prisoners in a prison? 
t1_dtiixpk	0	*	So what country would GWB be arrested if he set foot in?
t1_dtimb72	1	*	Sure they do, they just want to be re-elected more.
t1_dtifvom	1	*	They also learnt how to gang bang from the US ghettos and when you put the two together you get MS13 taking over the americas.
t1_dtifslq	0	*	Oh sorry then, misunderstood it :)
t1_dtk3xb5	1	*	well given how many people he got out of there over how much time. about 10 years.   
t1_dtisgb0	1	*	The Midwest and south isnt as backwards and racist as the media would have you believe.
t1_dtin8k1	0	*	Whoa...easy there big fella! Wasnt GWB out building schools in Tanzania? 
t1_dtilfk7	1	*	There may be some bad guys in there, but for fucks sake, at least convict them of a crime! If you dont have proof they did anything bad, then they probably didnt do anything bad.
t1_dtinwhi	1	*	Yeah this is a sick racist country. So knowing that what are you doing here? Were you brought here by force? Youre a guest so act like one. 
t1_dtjjxqo	1	*	He tried. Congress blocked him because they didnt know what to do with the prisoners.
t1_dtk3ybe	0	*	most of them were innocent, so really they should never have been detained in the first place. 
t1_dtinroc	0	*	Bombing has gone up every single year over the last decade and civilian casualties have always been above 90%. Obama tried to keep it to a minimum. Stay misinformed lol.
t1_dtjhgeh	1	*	Way to miss the point.
t1_dtinh01	1	*	Mentioning it in general seems to be considered a Reddit faux pas.  Lol I've dragged you down with me.
t1_dtitnf7	1	*	Why the fuck should it be closed?
t1_dtibdve	0	*	Imagine being this partisan
t1_dtih55r	1	*	im sure if he could have it his way he'd stop letting anyone who made less than a fortune per year in, he doesn't see poors as human afterall 
t1_dtiopia	1	*	I know a 13 year old kid who has that watch. Totally a bomb maker. Bloody idiots. 
t1_dtijepc	1	*	I can verify a fact.  That is a lot simpler than discovering a fact.
t1_dticm5n	1	*	Following by several diagonal backward steps, then another step back.
t1_dtiqmlo	1	*	Because they're not criminals, they're enemy combatants in a war that will never end.  Funny how that works, huh?
t1_dtil5vi	1	*	Those guys were already released.  The people left are the legit bad actors, but they have still not been convicted of anything.
t1_dtinrz4	1	*	And if you want their children to grow up mentally handicapped and riddled with STDs, send them to Mississippi.
t1_dtivaso	1	*	4 grand? Seriously? That's a 2 bedroom appartment in San Francisco.
t1_dti2nz9	0	*	I agree, but he was lying to congress about isis. So who knows. this is confimed with the leak known as intelgate. Obama was definitely a smile and wave kinda guy.
t1_dtitlfp	1	*	I mean Trump is a clown but Obamas approach to the war on terror didnt differ much from Bushs. 
t1_dtivn4m	1	*	I'm sure the prisoners there are all thankful they gave it an honest go of it.
t1_dtieerw	1	*	Because US rights don't just apply to citizens.  They apply to everyone under US jurisdiction, including (and, in the case of the fifth amendment, particularly) criminals.
t1_dtiprh4	1	*	The fuck are you going on about
t1_dtipcmc	1	*	Because he provided no sources to support his claim and ended with an emotional comment since that is what gets you upvotes here.
t1_dtigk8i	1	*	yah I figure they do...  doesn't that say something about America? using al-queda/taliban level techniques? 
t1_dtigspa	1	*	Australia IS an off shore prison.
t1_dtiu0lu	1	*	Yeah, I think this headline was supposed to get liberals angry at Trump, but this is pretty much the policy of both major parties, so.... Pot, kettle, etc.
t1_dtjfe11	1	*	Yeah, I was with him until he said that. I don't like the guy but people freak out way too much about him.
t1_dtiikc3	0	*	3 12 31 35 43 45
t1_dtiiang	0	*	Trump also signed an executive order that reverses how toilet paper at the White House should be paced on the dispenser. The opposite of how Obama preferred it.
t1_dtin78o	0	*	Lock her up!  -Donald Trump on a well-known political opponent.  If the comment was exaggerated, it was only slightly exaggerated.
t1_dtim9a3	0	*	That was his point........   .....  ...
t1_dtj2ju2	1	*	Only for 4 months though. And you can't cram everything through in that amount of time.  And back in the good ole' days of rational politics, you tried to produce bipartisan legislation.
t1_dtioaec	0	*	Wish it was /s. I'm a non-Christian immigrant and I'm starting to worry for my safety. 
t1_dtitblp	1	*	>Edit: If people could not reply to me with crackpot right wing conspiracy theories, that would be nice.  Yeah, politically charged commenting in /r/worldnews - you're going to have a bad time.
t1_dti68v6	1	*	only if you consider beheading torture
t1_dtihkcj	0	*	That was shoved into the budget by Republicans in an amendment. This is why Democrats should never bother trying to work with yall. You fuck things up then blame it on them.
t1_dtiusmu	1	*	Enemy combatants + not on American soil. It's a bullshit loophole that should be challenged in the SC
t1_dtiryxc	1	*	lol, uh yeah, Obama campaigned for President about closing them down and then kept them open for 8 years.
t1_dttcnhr	0	*	There currently is no cure for that
t1_dt8g50g	1	*	Opiods create their own demand.

t1_dt7k21h	0	*	The older generations definitely.
t1_dt86p0f	0	*	Yes and no,  marijuana is a part of the Chinese traditional herbal medicine and is vendored by pharmacists. So technically, China has medical marijuana. 
t1_dt85s54	0	*	And your solution would mean the collapse of the world economy at the time.
t1_dt7fxec	0	*	W18 and carfent come to mind. Apparently most of the fent coming in is fent analogues and not even just straight up fentanyl. 
t1_dt7cs11	0	*	Umm, his history pretty much confirms it? Not like I didn't look first...
t1_dt7lc92	1	*	I doubt the CCP cares about drug addicts, they probably let them die anyway. It's less than 0.15% of the populace and in their eyes these are useless people.
t1_dthb2g4	0	*	> Russian controlled  I think that's taking it a bit too far
t1_dthb38b	1	*	Other politicians dislike him for this. Pretty sure several Ministers of Defense also shared such thoughts (or higher ranking military officials, don't remember well enough)
t1_dthxyh7	0	*	Do you get paid to do this? I mean we know there is a state organized program, its been proven. So what exactly does your government give you?
t1_dthbkzm	1	*	Not to mention that Russia got banned. That's pretty damning evidence
t1_dtii2pv	1	*	Huh maybe thats why so many of his enemies end up dead? Hes just winning hearts and minds and whatnot?
t1_dth769s	0	*	i mean, he supports putin. I'll argue with anyone who supports Putin. Sorry if that offends your delicate sensibilities  
t1_dthfos4	1	*	In mother russia, truth is what ever you want it to be!
t1_dtgq3oi	1	*	Probably clueless. They did microscopic observations on the piss sample bottles and found tampering and scratch marks. 
t1_dsmmyzu	1	*	China's conquest of Tibet started four hundred years ago
t1_dspkbey	1	*	Easy there, China.
t1_ds3lidp	1	*	Not from ecological collapse caused by a fialure to address unsustainable populations.
t1_dt3o80g	1	*	The only accusation has been by Dylan Farrow.  If you have other ones please list them with articles to support them. I would be happy to see them, if they exist.
t1_dssz2e7	1	*	True, but a majority of Americans are against that.
t1_dssppqk	1	*	That movie is a work of fiction.   For him to 'pitch' his story and take credit for catching Hanssen is asinine.
t1_dssy28c	0	*	I'm having a hard time telling if you're serious. Is this really an edgy thing to say?
t1_dssy2wj	1	*	Guantanamo?
t1_dssw8k8	1	*	See, in Capitalist America money is valued much more than life.   Unless you're a rich guy robbing poor people, then it's called business.
t1_dv34i1s	0	*	Only happens in American prisons.
t1_dv3sihq	0	*	I imagine being in prison for 11 years would feel like a lot longer than being free for 11 years and just living life. But I haven't been in prison for 11 years, so I could be wrong 
t1_dv3dskx	1	*	can you not read or something btw? 'for life' means 11 with parole, 25 max in this case. 
t1_dv46ljj	0	*	If that's the case, then you need to get better jails, not longer sentences.    Rehabilitation is not impossible.  
t1_dv3t4qj	1	*	You just learned that?
t1_dv4077s	0	*	You might be joking but its really a sad time when you cant even gather knowledge without being watched and/or automatically suspected.
t1_dv3r5zn	1	*	Samesies fellow king
t1_dv31z5c	1	*	Imagine thinking Rick and Morty invented this joke. 
t1_dv3uc1z	1	*	He's already dangerously fucked up
t1_dv4ha7c	0	*	Planning and actually executing an attack are different things.     11 years for planning is excessive, especially considering the age of the guy. 
t1_dv3wuui	1	*	The article casually mentions it with no detail as to the nature of the diagnosis so I'm in the dark as to who diagnosed him, where he is on the spectrum, or how functional he is.
t1_dtez1u1	1	*	I care. People are the same all over the world. 
t1_ds28e4l	1	*	The post is about Canada though 
t1_ds2dnmp	0	*	In legal states like Oregon we have local labs that will test for pesticides, mold, potency and chemical profile. If you are in a medical only state you can probably find a lab, too.
t1_ds2bto9	1	*	Good journalism is about communicating things that are important.  Locking that behind a paywall negates the purpose of having journalists.
t1_ds24qud	1	*	the chemicals are flushed afaik  you wont be eating/smoking them

t1_ds23ybz	1	*	Until the advertisers' interests and the journalists' interests differ, then you're back to reading only part of the story.
t1_ds2igq1	1	*	Agreed. All emphasis now should be on research of health effects of these chemicals upon immolation, IMO. Let's get some solid numbers and find out exactly what the real risks are.
t1_ds38yyj	1	*	I wash my bud after harvesting and before drying. Just like vegetables.
t1_ds38aeu	1	*	Every batch we make is third party tested before being allowed to be sold. 
t1_ds29iv3	0	*	Need a chemist who won't pop hot on any drug tests?
t1_ds2bpn5	1	*	Vaping is still a form of immolation, so yes on that. Concentrates are a cause of concern mainly because the pesticide used gets concentrated too as a part of the process.
t1_ds2tjte	0	*	I'm curious, what are the effects of smoking thesr pesticides? 
t1_ds2bc47	1	*	advertising like everyone else
t1_ds2bxt9	1	*	You can't be entirely sure, but it is unlikely. If you bought legal product from a licensed facility it should have passed testing before hitting the shelf.
t1_ds2fasp	1	*	Hob?
t1_ds27vqe	0	*	It's closer to English than Mexican.
t1_ds29dc1	0	*	HA! Except when a crop fails pest specs it just gets brought down to CA and sold to bak east for 650$ a lb instead of being destroyed.  Oregon is really screwing up the game for alot of people  
t1_ds2fh8a	1	*	Ha! Yeah, that could probably happen. But the black market is stuffed to the gills right now, so that might be harder than one might think.
t1_ds242ek	0	*	Business losses can be carried over to a future year to reduce taxes. 
t1_ds24r2p	0	*	What degrees would you need to get to become a weed inspector?

t1_ds29v3j	1	*	Are you serious?
t1_dtxb0eb	1	*	It's basically as bad as any other case of desecrating a corpse... punishable in many countries including Russia, but not a sexual crime.

t1_dsxkg8d	1	*	Yea a tsunami is just gonna roll down the Ottawa river and make Chalk River a Fukushima 2.0 /s
t1_dsxoegp	1	*	Aye. It's absurdity. There's not many safer places to put a dangerous thing than deep underground. Put it deep enough, and even if all hell breaks loose it just gets buried and *stays there.*

t1_ds2bu9o	0	*	4 dead vs 10000... China and Russia don't even have real elections.   Obviously the US isn't the greatest but youre drawing a false equivalency.

t1_ds8hbe5	1	*	Oh man, that dude is awesome. 
t1_ds8hlbp	0	*	But with the addition of Jack Russells as a pedigree breed that will change. They will set a standard and the parsons will become more rare as a result. 
t1_ds974p5	0	*	The Banfield (PetSmart vet clinics) plans are like this. They pay for all the preventative work including teeth cleanings and our experience has been fabulous. They run ~$30/month.
t1_ds8e8zz	1	*	That's all well and good but as you said, it's anecdotal. Your one example doesn't change the facts at all.
t1_ds8r5kw	1	*	They adapt easily to your lifestyle! That's why they are great for anyone. Ours likes to lounge around with us but she also loves running outside and playing. I love her so much!!

t1_ds9s5pe	0	*	Vets make a fortune off of them that's why. At least RSPCA has puppy farms as a priority.

t1_ds8pc93	1	*	You were right to be horrified. It's not cute in the slightest , it means you've screwed up a dog's genetics with inbreeding so hard that the poor guy can barely even breathe.
t1_ds8xvk5	0	*	Are they usually dumb as bricks too? My baby boy growing up was the sweetest dog, but man was he dumb
t1_ds8l5a7	1	*	Why not stop breeding them. They should suffer just so we have more amusing purchase options. You can still cross breed mutts of all different types without purebreeding inbred mutations for profit.

t1_dtokujp	0	*	> for him to do jail time.  For what?
t1_dtnyvc8	0	*	I mean during the election trump was implying she should be killed, I'd think if this was all going on it'd be calls for civil war now.
t1_dtoc060	1	*	> Have you seriously not paid attention to any of the outrageous scandals this idiot has done?  Be specific, because most of them have had to be retracted. 
t1_dto2581	1	*	my mistake, I did read it, but when I searched for the name it didn't come up, I probably misspelled it.  shift happens.
t1_dto05n6	0	*	Lol look at the upvotes. They've been deleting these all day. Probably kept this one because the source shares their agenda.
t1_dto2abn	0	*	They can't tell you. They're just spouting nonsense as usual.

t1_dtntjz8	1	*	Like pure maple syrup

t1_du6jbqr	0	*	My point is that you can't blame this on arab propaganda or something as an Israel news outlet(and fairly right wing one at that)  has the same title. 
t1_du8doez	0	*	Israel paid for the film and the film festival. And the film is their Oscar entry. So its not a state sponsored boycott of anything. Apologize to Israel for posting garbage.

t1_du759jr	1	*	\*ahem\* America is not without its problems
t1_du6q0ch	1	*	I group it all as middle Eastern religions Christianity, Islam, Jews... But no saying something is bad and a phobia or unreasonable fear of, are two different things. Some fears are reasonable.

t1_du6griu	0	*	I thought the White Helmet group was revealed to be a fraud, and an arm of one of the Islamic militant groups?  edit: nevermind, I fell for disinformation.

t1_du6k3yd	0	*	So these people (regardless of who they do or do not represent) didn't just shout at the top of their lungs the name of the thing they wanted nobody to know about?  Because I'm pretty sure they did.
t1_du7o7rq	1	*	> make cultural and athletic funding dependent upon loyalty to the state of Israel  An Israeli version of [Cho Yoon-sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cho_Yoon-sun) right there! 
t1_du6vgth	1	*	I know how you feel. I live in Manhattan and they cut off a lane downtown to provide security for Trump Tower. It's annoying every time I go down there.
t1_du6vus9	1	*	You'd be correct.  Pretty much like anywhere else, it divides more or less neatly along the conservative right - liberal left spectrum.
t1_du6udg8	0	*	In my experience most people obsessed with revisionist Nordic bullshit are generally anti-Semitic, but I'm willing to give you the benefit of the doubt. 
t1_du7awx5	0	*	Yeah dude the ~50% of people that disagree with you politically all want to commit genocide, that's literally the only reason somebody wouldn't be liberal!

t1_dtcw419	1	*	Powerful use religion to control the sheep. Simple as that. What ruse would the government use to enforce its decisions on the people if not claim it is the will of God?

t1_ds1mmrc	1	*	Nope. How did you even get that idea from my comment? The Indian military is partly responsible too. But atleast the military doesn't control the government in India. 
t1_ds1knme	1	*	Dont forget Pakistans nukes... they add some spice as well
t1_ds1t7qo	1	*	its a game of chicken. You think the more liberal cities want terrorist growth in the rural areas? Nah, but if the US is going to pay for it why should we care?

t1_ds1f3cf	1	*	Umm, when did he do that?

t1_ds1h6yn	0	*	Fun fact - Most of the mujahideen didn't become the Taliban. It split into multiple groups one of them being the Taliban.
t1_ds1ehd4	1	*	That's an outadted image mate. The Northwest and Western areas have all been cleared.  These days it's actually Pakistan which is taking hit after hit from the Afghan side of the border...

t1_ds1hj4g	1	*	>They gave the stealth helicopter that went down in the raid that killed Bin Laden to China.  Actually....a simple google search proves that as false.

t1_ds1nlcp	0	*	> Pakistan wants to seal off the border  If they tell Mexico to pay for it, maybe Trump will be supportive.
t1_ds1mck4	1	*	I hope not. For India's sake. Being an ally of the US is some sort of a poisoned chalice to be honest

t1_ds1hio8	0	*	Even when he does something right hes wrong. Right? Damn liberals 
t1_ds1nk87	1	*	If they harbor terrorists they are as much of a terror state as Palestine is. The fact that we basically pay them off is absurd.
t1_ds1fakg	1	*	I'd love to see that but I'm pretty sure Saudi Arabia could tank the US Dollar if we did that.
t1_ds1ekga	1	*	In addition to what other people have mentioned, we have been able to engage in military action within their borders and they just vaguely complain about it instead of try to actually stop us.
t1_ds1zjlt	1	*	So you're saying is that were FORCED to be their allies like a hostage? Fuck that and fuck Pakistan
t1_ds1j9g4	0	*	You haven't been paying much attention over the past year, have you?
t1_ds1em4g	0	*	He's done what Bush and Obama failed to do, which is publicly call out Pakistan for it's bullshit.
t1_ds1i42r	0	*	And Microsoft?
t1_ds1ch6z	1	*	Well Russia did it even earlier during the Vietnam war, and so on.  CIA aid to the Afghans was pennies compared to what the NVA got.
t1_ds1ei5u	0	*	That's on you, I think. Nobody phrases it that way. It'd be trump authorizes attack on Pakistan or something.
t1_ds1j0qp	1	*	Pakistan is the only nuclear power to have tried to invade another nuclear power.
t1_ds2f1qf	1	*	The story that the US is criticising another government for the same thing it does? Yeah it changes it a fucking lot. 
t1_ds1jz72	1	*	It's like no one has ever seen The West Wing
t1_ds1fq08	1	*	During the campaign he condemned SA but quickly cozied up to them to ensure they buy billions of dollars worth of military equipment. 
t1_ds1s662	0	*	Trumps unstable if he does a thing you support?    Insulting trump being the cool thing to do is getting really old and isn't working anymore.  
t1_ds1jg9p	1	*	Oh calm down that's a strawman and you know it. All I did was provide more info. What I'm really worried about is trump trying to solve this.
t1_ds23b27	1	*	Thank God someone is talking sense in here. Great write up on a deeply complex issue. This should be at the top, can't believe some of the nonsense that's getting upvoted.
t1_ds2g3ld	0	*	The kicker there is that China is probably even more distrustful of Pakistan and probably wouldn't have shared any of their findings of their inspection.
t1_ds1fyzf	0	*	These sort of things are dealt with diplomatically and behind closed doors. They are not meant to be sorted out with 280 characters.
t1_ds1fdvn	0	*	This is the perfect reply to these Sunny's. Simplex and it gets the point across. Also it made me laugh
t1_ds1e4fu	1	*	Sounds like you have it worked out though 
t1_ds1v8on	1	*	It took the president nearly a full year in office to learn that Pakistan has a history of harboring terrorists?
t1_ds307u6	0	*	Just at the expense of spreading misinformation which gains mass validation. I hope you are proud of yourself. Congratulations, you are a true whore.
t1_ds1kdub	0	*	And then?
t1_ds1eu6k	1	*	As well as Canada 
t1_ds1wnkf	0	*	Please elaborate for me, this sounds interesting 
t1_ds1hcu5	1	*	They gave dud Tomahawks that fell on their territory to China as well. China was able to reverse engineer it. They gave reverse engineered missiles back to pakistan.

t1_ds1debb	1	*	And crying whataboutism whenever criticised for being guilty of doing whatever it is they are complaining that another country is doing to them.  Like interference in elections.
t1_ds1jad4	1	*	Only reason they have nukes is because of the US.
t1_ds1fg7c	1	*	The arrests of the more extremist, wahabists believing, royals will help with that. This is more pressing.
t1_ds1gqn0	1	*	 No becuase thats $$$ in his pocket.
t1_ds1e06v	0	*	> Not communicating diplomatically  Not like he's a president or anything. 
t1_ds1jo4f	1	*	The aid is to secure their nuclear weapons arsenal so that they don't end up in the hands of non-state actors.
t1_ds1otah	0	*	> Except I feel like Trump still comes off as a guy whos unstable enough to actually cut the aid  Is it unstable to do what you threatened to do?
t1_ds1k4se	1	*	He'd Tweet that they are ending aid and then see that as having actually changed the policy.  
t1_ds1gmvf	0	*	Lol- you feel that way? Great opinion, thanks for sharing.
t1_ds1ku1k	1	*	Half the truth is a lot better than his usual average though. I guess I'll take any improvement if I can.
t1_ds1o0o0	0	*	When using an ellipsis, it is considered bad form to use only two dots.
t1_ds1gzy2	1	*	> It's a way to siphon money from taxpayers into multinational companies in the guise of aid.  Now you know why some people were so against the Paris Accord.
t1_ds1he09	1	*	Doesn't our current admin support Saudi more than previous ones? 
t1_ds1l2q9	0	*	Yep. Say what you will about trump, but he's not afraid to piss people off. He's made huge cuts to government and is already saving a ton of money. So far I'm pretty impressed

t1_ds22ex1	0	*	Ask the women who were repressed in the post revolution Iran if it was peaceful?
t1_ds1iblk	0	*	So the aid money that potentially goes to actually help the avergae person is what needs to go? 
t1_ds1fivh	1	*	Oh, did Trump say we're ending the war? It doesn't look like he said that. It looks like you just said something about aid. Which should make the war worse.
t1_ds1i34s	0	*	Yes this is true but the US gave Pakistan that tech in the first place so this isn't the reason - it's a side effect. 
t1_ds1iwx8	1	*	Well if the prince is against supporting terorrism them obviously they are political enemies.
t1_ds1fm77	1	*	GOOD point. 
t1_ds1eek0	1	*	He might. He isn't a politician. He won't think about the repercussions of rocking the boat like a real politician would. 
t1_du5vxnk	1	*	I bet you pee on their food and hope they dont take the pills they need to help them get through the cancer too uh?
t1_du5y62l	1	*	This is pointless. He'll be voting straight Democrat tickets for years after he's dead.
t1_duwmwmy	1	*	-10xb0 C is more than enough to kill a man, what are you on about..
t1_dtqr952	1	*	True. The jews who fled the holocaust were willing to accept any country. Many Jews fled to China to survive.
t1_dtq5o73	1	*	Maybe we could all acknowledge that Israel and Palestine both do, in fact, exist and that they have some issues to sort out.
t1_dtqsrz5	0	*	But Jews were there first, thousands of years before Christianity and Islam were invented. So they were the original owners who got invaded and expelled, just like Native Americans.

t1_du12m1j	1	*	I appreciate the diverse array of perspectives.
t1_du3ocyv	0	*	Anything post 67 demarcation lines is. Otherwise I have no issues with the Jewish Israelis to have the rest. It is their homeland but not all of it is...

t1_du2y5l1	1	*	VTOL is terrifying, it's not safer than fixed wing at all. It's basically like balancing on top of a sphere. And if you lose power while in VTOL you drop straight down instead of gliding.
t1_du3da7h	1	*	Seriously, this rumor needs to die. It keeps getting stirred up by polish nationalists / the anti putin crowd. It was a combination of bad weather and human error, period.

t1_dt9ylp4	1	*	To be fair, getting annoyed that your deodorant is being confiscated at airport security isn't anti-security.
t1_dtab9en	1	*	I lost all sympathy for her situation where she started accusing someone of being a Nazi for having an undercut.
t1_dt9ypqo	1	*	As a person, I hate most people for their ignorance, entitlement, and stupidity.  As an American, I hate her even more for perpetuating the 'ignorant American' stereotype. I hope justice gets served.
t1_dta0tak	1	*	The worst part is I think the security requirements are requirements for planes to fly into the US.  
t1_dta5o0z	1	*	Having freedom of opinion instead of freedom of speech doesn't make a country fascist.

t1_dta37je	0	*	There was a plot though.  It was foiled.
t1_dta05ss	1	*	Oh hey I'm from Amer.. er.. Canada
t1_dt9wurf	1	*	They have laws against trivialisng Nazism. Calling someone a Nazi because you got stopped in an airport would most likely fall under that.
t1_dt9yqqz	1	*	Shes used to calling everybody she disagrees with a nazi already lmao
t1_dtasp3v	1	*	Just seen a picture, that is the face of someone who rallies the parents in outrage because their kids are being taught sex education in school.

t1_dta2ysb	0	*	Painfully clear that you literally have no idea what the Council on Foreign Relations is.
t1_dtacvid	1	*	Mind boggling. Stupid kids. Bullying sucks, I'm sorry you went through it too.
t1_dtagd7c	1	*	even if it was and it was simply a missunderstanding with the police, a normal human being would just throw the 1 deo roller/stick into the bin and be done with it.

t1_dt9ynex	0	*	Ahh.   Yes. The left. Where name calling and facts are the same.     Also: I guess those cops must be Nazis.
t1_dta9t14	0	*	Those must be pretty shitty or amateur nazis.  Their flags are brand new.  Wouldn't actual nazis have a lot more well used flags and not ones fresh out from the factory? 
t1_dtafvs4	0	*	 > every cop kills everyone they have a problem with in America   ...nobody is saying that. 
t1_dt9x7rk	1	*	yet you cant even say shit on primetime tv 
t1_dtabidh	1	*	Its security theater, dehumanizing, and extremely inconvenient. Thats why people get bent out of shape.  That said, Ive never had a problem with TSA. US border control, OTOH...
t1_dt9xzrj	0	*	Don't let the professors out of the university sphere of higher education. They are never wrong and nothing they say can be questioned. 
t1_dta0fyk	1	*	They were behind her, so clearly they should not investigate her at all before investigating the other men, right? 
t1_dtaiqq5	0	*	No those police officers are literally not nazis. Its not an opinion.
t1_dta0449	1	*	You are cute. :) 
t1_dt9ykjm	1	*	You okay man?

t1_dt9wnqr	1	*	I won't lie, I laughed
t1_dt9vnis	0	*	USA. 
t1_dt9yhe8	0	*	They also have blanket laws against insulting people. You'd think a country that wanted to distance themselves from the Nazi party would actually have freedom of speech.
t1_dt9wdg8	0	*	I would have expected the opposite, doesn't pretty much everyone in America think they're in some part Irish?
t1_dtaj41n	1	*	Oh, like Beethoven?
t1_dtapq48	1	*	Yeah so was Hitler you fucking Nazi
t1_dta3fby	0	*	The point is that Poland bore the blunt of Nazi atrocities and somehow there are Polish Nazis.
t1_dt9wn0k	1	*	Probably shoot you
t1_dt9zimm	0	*	Ugh what a vile woman. Gross. 
t1_dta7df4	0	*	Yes because modern day Germany can be compared to Nazi germany. Comments like that are why most europeans think many americans are morons.
t1_dtamd6b	1	*	As much as I hate the change, there's a reason why Merkel is called the Leader of the Free World instead of us now.
t1_dt9xmod	1	*	Yeah, it's the other police officer. Her story reflects this too
t1_dt9wcb4	1	*	my thoughts as well. 
t1_dta0sp4	1	*	I love Frankfurt Airport, it's modern, looks nice, it's clean, and people are polite. But more important for me: it is extremely well organised (Deutsche Grxfcndlichkeit). 
t1_dta3rjv	1	*	I would like to see her frame of mind.
t1_dta1jk3	1	*	Lol 
t1_dta8spp	0	*	God, I hope you're right.
t1_dta4dj8	1	*	Pretty frustrating for every knowledgeable American too.
t1_dta3vfl	0	*	Because calling your cop friend names is the same?  Why don't you go and call a black cop the n-word and tell me how it worked out?
t1_dtalq63	1	*	She's a far left professor, she probably thinks they should have been punched and lost their jobs because of that haircut.
t1_dt9vbfa	1	*	Glory to Arstotzka.
t1_dt9w14x	1	*	A fair point. I'm talking more about the U.S. where this is a cross sectional issue. I don't think Germany wants to become as litigious as we are even then.
t1_dt9r5b5	1	*	No one has totally unrestricted speech. Even America still has slander laws.
t1_dtaz0gx	1	*	Germany can have whatever laws it wants.  I understand where they're coming from with such legislation.  I'm just glad the US doesn't think like this (in regards to free speech)
t1_dtaoal2	1	*	Karma court time
t1_dta3jvs	1	*	It's obvious she got her degree very long ago. She has a very strange view of the current world. 
t1_dta0cwq	1	*	that hair cut isn't unique to hitler youth, i think it was generally popular among young men of the time and similar hair styles are popular among young today. 
t1_dta0b9i	1	*	I had to stop reading after she felt the need to call out her own hypocrisy in criticising how 'waveringly' the German people could speak English.

t1_dt9xn8g	1	*	Is the joke being that Americans are too stupid to know uncle Adi was Austrian?Or that they ca't distinguish Austria from Australia?

t1_dtaeqa6	1	*	whats the issue with calling her miss? im not a native speaker
t1_dt9yvm3	0	*	I understand that. That's why we need another Nuremberg trials. It's unacceptable and we shouldn't stand for these laws anymore.

t1_dt9vdi3	0	*	It is incredibly hard to sue someone for slander in the US. We have some of the weakest libel laws.
t1_dta2szj	1	*	There's a distinction in German law. For certain offenses the victim has to press charges or it won't be prosecuted. This is true for insults too

t1_dt9yuv0	0	*	>if you do it to a police officer in uniform you will end up in front of a criminal court  However at demonstrations, they police usually don't worry as they have bigger things to worry about. 
t1_dta1wc0	1	*	You could say she terrorized the staff at that airport.
t1_dt9xqud	1	*	I'm still curious as to when the Latvians stole the potato jokes from the Irish.  
t1_dtau1hi	1	*	To be fair, she has a ToyTownGermany post to back up her claim. Also a dailymail article, although that refers back to her first link.
t1_dta9wss	1	*	I have serious issues with people who get mad when you call them miss or ma'am. Sorry for being polite?
t1_dtdek1q	1	*	He laughs, knowingly that he now has a rich assortment of german deodorants given by the airport security.

t1_dta4dw5	1	*	True. I just wanted to make clear that there are exceptions.
t1_dt9w3e3	0	*	Not sarcasm, her book on Pakistan's military and their focus on fighting India for Kashmir looks interesting.
t1_dt9znly	1	*	I wonder if she calls it a *Hitler Youth Haircut* when she's *outside* of Germany ...
t1_dt9wtuy	1	*	Lest we forget the decades-old Limbaugh-coined feminazi!
t1_dtadr05	1	*	Sounds like she is an extreme bigot that is heavily entitled and did not get her way.

t1_dta9qbu	1	*	Reading her HuffPo diatribe, it became immediately obvious we're dealing with a verbose pedant. She needs everyone to know how large her vocabulary is, even if it makes her point less obvious. 
t1_dtblkws	1	*	No. I'm talking about the far left people call someone a bigot, facist, Nazi to shut down conversation. I'm saying no one should be able to call someone a Nazi for no reason.

t1_dtaaj1w	0	*	Thats because the little entitled bitch forgot she wasnt in America. You can be a total shitbag to TSA and even cops in America but it doesnt work that way everywhere else. Stupid bitch!

t1_dta1vbb	0	*	To be fair, they've locked that page against IP edits and have been working regular clean-up. Almost every edit of the style you found has been followed up by someone else reverting it.

t1_dta8zbn	0	*	Germany has a bit of a history with Nazis and they tend to get a bit upset when being called Nazis. I think that is understandable given the context.
t1_dt9uch3	0	*	Yep, you arrive in a country you obey their laws. When in Rome, all that jazz.
t1_dtamogd	1	*	Oh Americans, why you gotta be like this?
t1_dt9yl5t	1	*	She was trying to compliment them.
t1_dta7y53	1	*	she advocated for drone strikes in Pakistan so let's not mistake her for a Quaker or a peacenik like the Peace Studies program at my alma mater
t1_dt9xf0q	1	*	>In 2010, Fair denied the notion that drones caused any civilian deaths  Hm.
t1_dt9v7sc	1	*	The Irish are at least known for having a good sense of humor.
t1_dtav833	1	*	Sounds like abuse of power to me. What an asshole, honestly. Leave the poor guy alone! I know marijuana is illegal there, but that isn't the right thing to do.

t1_dta9dkj	1	*	that's like the only time I ever saw my hometown Hannover on reddit : threat of a terrorist attack.  Die Antwort auf diese Frage wxfcrde sie nur verunsichern.
t1_dt9xjqx	1	*	Her idea of a reasonable explanation is even worse than what she is accused of.  Instead of insulting the cops she thinks it's better if she decided to go after an innocent bystander.
t1_dta4a4n	1	*	Didn't thought about it, yet. Hmm, I think it's not a bad thing that the state gives me the possibility to defend my dignity, if I want. 
t1_dta1ct3	0	*	That's objectively, patently false. The US absolutely has more free speech protections than Europe. This is not up for debate. 
t1_dta80cr	1	*	Nice to have above the fireplace
t1_dt9z8g3	0	*	She wasn't arrested.
t1_dta5veu	1	*	'not a terrorist' depends on your stands, she advocates drone attacks on weak 'evidence'. It's the same as a promoter of jihad who doesnt get his own hands dirty in my opinion. 
t1_dt9zvkj	1	*	Affirmative action is alive and well in academia
t1_dt9xohq	0	*	Now you're just making shit up. It's been less than 1000 since 2015. Closest was 995 deaths in 2015. Still bad but not upwards of 1000. Quit making shit up.

t1_dta321f	0	*	I think every country has a bad reputation for their tourists. Brits are drunk and loud, Spaniards are untidy and eat much, Germans are arrogant and reserve all the sun lounges for them...
t1_dtah3e2	0	*	Yeah no, you are not a liberal if you think social justice is a liberal talking point, not a leftist one, or you think liberalism is leftism which is even more wrong, if thats even possible.
t1_dtbpefk	1	*	Hell yea preach 
t1_dta6eec	0	*	The university should fire her. She sounds like a mess.
t1_dt9tlfk	0	*	Yes, I agree it's a crime. I'm saying that the fact that it's a crime is ridiculous. 
t1_dtata1u	1	*	How does someone like this even get a job at any school? Is this an American thing? I've met an American college professor who didn't know where Turkey is. But this?
t1_dtb0b9b	1	*	Gender studies phd apparently (not joking)
t1_dt9xjsg	1	*	>Well lady, you may not be a terrorist. But you are a terrible person.  You misspelled racist.

t1_dszxj3j	1	*	You are learning to channel the powers of evil for good.
t1_dszpaf6	1	*	Correct.  All people are not the same, and people from different cultures are different, and value things differently, too.
t1_dszkpvq	1	*	Not arguing that, but if you see the link its just  one of the place where you are more likely to be murdered. (94th with 4.88 rate compared to lets say Germany 190th with 0.85)
t1_dszp2r5	1	*	Most to all of what you describe is a result of corrupt globalism, and immigration is one of their many tools.  I never said it was the only one, its just one of the hardest to undo...
t1_dszvcvk	1	*	Arent nearly all suicides caused by mental health issues though?
t1_dszlat1	0	*	That sounds like you're generalizing an entire nation 
t1_dszfl7w	1	*	Yeah, no, not knowing how to write would have is not a typo. It's okay to admit you didn't know it...
t1_dszs65r	1	*	Classifying mental health issues as health issues is unfair. It's not surprising that people who are depressed kill themself in fact I'd wager 95% of suicides are due to depression and anxiety. 
t1_dt0z95g	0	*	I'd argue that any country with 1/8th the GDP of a country 20x It's size is doing pretty well.

t1_dsv1hku	0	*	Except for rape, murder and sexual assault. Then you might be surprised how short prison sentences can be.

t1_duwoehh	0	*	Trust me Parking ticket is not why they want to implement such system. It's about TOTAL control. 
t1_dsp0ams	0	*	They dont come after me, simple as that. The president was chosen democraticly. The people who participated in the coup are by definition, the true Oxford English definition, terrorist.

t1_dtvccyd	1	*	Fucked up.
t1_dtvfuvn	1	*	Yes yes, also there was an uproar back in the day that the Queen and the King were responsible for the disappearance of 10 children. The news got supressed way back but Idk how much of it is true.
t1_dtwxnu5	1	*	You are mistaken.
t1_dustni0	1	*	Wow, your flimsy ego must really need a win right now if you're getting that smug over something like this...and yes, I did.

t1_dsh4bee	1	*	Blood libel.
t1_dsgnp76	1	*	Not Israel's backyard anyway...
t1_dshbhyh	0	*	Propaganda.  The United States has been awash with pro-Israel propaganda for generations (since at least 1967), and anti-Muslim propaganda for almost as long (since at least 1979).
t1_dsc05qk	1	*	> asian  Nice try making it about asians in general instead of just Chinese ;)
t1_dsct154	0	*	yes, and none of these apply. This was an deadly event, but it bears no world-historical significance.
t1_dscwlxs	1	*	We will soon find out. Judging by the accommodation which looks like a burned out husk already it might have perished in the flames too 
t1_dumn5nc	1	*	>pay increase for teachers  LOL
t1_dumts2f	0	*	Why would they know you have a gun on you? They never should know that. 
t1_dumlntv	0	*	What? 
t1_dumttjd	1	*	I would think a teacher would jump at the opportunity to properly educate themselves about the issue at hand while simultaneously protecting their precious students.
t1_dumlhoy	1	*	Trumps only had a year. Give it time. 
t1_dumn1we	0	*	Yeah, if that teacher in Sandy Hook was armed, she might've hit one of her kids by mistake!  Oh wait, they were all murdered anyway.
t1_dumm7th	0	*	it does if you hate the people in it. 
t1_dumunkk	0	*	Um, excuse me what?

t1_durf0yz	1	*	>  and nobody   Why not ask them instead, thank you.
t1_dur6aik	1	*	You don't even just have to remember. The newest article over there is There is no humanitarian crisis in Venezuela.
t1_dur58wq	0	*	Well, the government disarmed their citizens a few years ago, so there's that, too.
t1_dur5v4i	0	*	The US still manages to intervene constantly anyway though.
t1_dur5m88	0	*	You have Canada for that dontcha worry
t1_dus0s3v	1	*	What was that old joke...?  How do you know when a politician is lying?  xa7 When their lips are moving. 
t1_duras1j	1	*	I dont care what socialists used to think about Venezuela. I wasnt there. Im not a socialist. Maybe theyre all stupid. But this isn't socialism. Stop the circlejerk. 
t1_durcy8o	1	*	Very relevant statement given the current push for gun bans.

t1_durs3g2	0	*	ah, reddit. where you are a leftist nazi.
t1_duqyd0o	0	*	Europe invented Democracy and the Republic moron.  The entire foundation of Western Civilization comes from Europe.  Most European countries are superior in every way to the US that actually counts. 
t1_dur6yya	0	*	Yes, but that time, it was even less real. They made prices and wrote it everywhere, but there was no coins or bills.
t1_dur3sfi	1	*	That's why famine is so awful.  Eventually, people will ingest whatever they can metabolize according to physics.
t1_durli1l	0	*	and also ends in mass death and starvation.  I'm not saying you're wrong, but jesus wept, we can probably try for better right?
t1_dutjc80	1	*	I liked Bernie, but more and more I'm thinking they really dodged a bullet with that guy.
t1_dur7rm8	0	*	There's 2 crypto coins acctualy, Petro and yesterday Maduro announced Petro y oro (Petro and gold)
t1_duqzrmu	1	*	Starving to death may actually be preferable to watching Fox News.
t1_durmp6e	0	*	That sounds awful. The world is very very unfair. The Internet is so strange in the sense that I can write to you from the other side of the globe but can not really do anything to help you.
t1_dur9pot	1	*	I think we found where some of the PUBG cheaters are coming from. Can you imagine playing Battleground for crates just to eat? You literally would win a chicken dinner.
t1_dur99u3	0	*	*Iraq

t1_dur7ys1	1	*	Asking for a friend?
t1_durto8h	1	*	> Famines in north Korea or China didn't seem to do much   They're starving in China? Did you know that in Chinese there are a thousand words for rice but no word for friend?
t1_dur5sqo	1	*	The serious question is who is supplying these arms.
t1_duriyq1	1	*	Fair enough. Potential future, then.
t1_durjm1a	1	*	You're technically correct, but I think a 17 year old can be held accountable for a crime. Just barely a child.
t1_dtcwb6j	0	*	Good point. But couldnt they use the transaction to track the slavers and apprehend them? Then confiscate the money? It is possible. Still I doubt any government cares enough to fund such operations. 
t1_dtbhcei	1	*	>  What does the average Russian under 40 actually do?  Drinking vodka, beating wife, injecting heroin and other stuff *bleak, terrible and hopeless* people usually do. 
t1_dtb9z3r	0	*	You are aware that most rtv *is* at least *mostly* scripted, yeah?
t1_dsggcmf	1	*	No, why?
t1_dsfxt52	1	*	Sure. The patriarch was a KGB agent in soviet times.
t1_dsflidk	0	*	I'm not saying Putin is trying to be exactly like Stalin. I'm saying Putin is of the camp that defends Stalin/avoids talking about his crimes. 
t1_dsfljxx	0	*	will copy and paste from other similar comment: I'm not saying Putin is trying to be exactly like Stalin. I'm saying Putin is of the camp that defends Stalin/avoids talking about his crimes. 
t1_dshc5ud	0	*	I wouldn't say he enthusiastically allied with Germany. They both wanted to carve up Poland and take pieces for themselves, and they both had plans to invade the other one once that was over.
t1_dsgche1	0	*	Please show me an example of r/latestagecapitalism denying Stalin's gulags
t1_du05kfr	1	*	I live in the region I am from it and yeah youre right I forgot about the Hezbollah sorry lol but loving iran=Idiocy ? I guess thats some classic imternet bs
t1_dt6prqn	0	*	That might help in a short term but prices will just scale with demand and cost of goods. 
t1_ds3bfwr	1	*	Exactly. In most western countries it's almost nonexistent.
t1_ds49t7p	1	*	And that is pretty much just down to negotiation
t1_ds3gurd	0	*	If you're male or female your pay should reflect your abilities, but being male or female shouldn't affect your pay.

t1_dsozepm	1	*	IIRC isn't he actually the reason Apple is still a thing today? I think it was mostly to be good PR for MS but the popular telling is because Bill n Steve were buddies

t1_dsoavhw	0	*	I hope he succeeds.
t1_dsp8r8a	1	*	But you have to get the money first. You can't focus on the bigger problems in an impactful way until you first of all get the money. 
t1_dsom14a	0	*	Trump isn't a billionaire.
t1_dsp0sn0	1	*	Oh great another Trump comment that's completely irrelevant to the post.

t1_dsop4eb	0	*	He puts it in his own charity
t1_dsol7zm	0	*	> They address the kind of issues redditors keep complaining about, but action is better than words.  What is even the point of *this* comment? That is the comment /u/kittenTakeover was replying to.
t1_dsp4wlo	1	*	Yeah, everyone's got to do what they can. Everything helps. 
t1_dsol67z	1	*	Thank you! No one else read it. They just take the title and comment!
t1_dspcp7f	0	*	Because they borrowed money from Japan? What aren't you understanding? Countries borrow money from each other all the time. The USA owes China 1.2 trillion dollars.
t1_dsqlsgx	1	*	What companies? Any link?
t1_dsolslg	1	*	Of course not. Just using a billionaire as an example of how average people aren't pulling their weight doesn't really work well. 
t1_duf2qgf	1	*	I agree that they have the right to do that, I was just explaining to the guy above me because he didn't seem to understand how a cookie is used in tracking.
t1_dudnuo1	1	*	Evercookie

t1_dsfrpqn	0	*	He was emailing Cohen late 2015 saying he could get Putin onboard a potential PR campaign.
t1_ds3emql	1	*	Are you angry over something? I hope you can enjoy 2018. Being in a rage for the next year doesn't hurt anyone but yourself. I don't want to make you angrier, but try to lighten up a little. 
t1_dt2nac3	0	*	Your theory about why he isn't visiting the U.K. is beyond pathetic. Donald Trump could call your mother a whore and you would find some way to say he's right. You're a fucking loser. 
t1_dsknqac	0	*	They are shithole countries... how is this controversial?
t1_dskw1hd	1	*	OK, but I was responding to your original comment which stated that Sadiq got 44% of the vote. You then edited it to the turnout-adjusted figure without making clear what you edited.
t1_dskmawy	0	*	Thats a different concept. 88% of people might not want Trump to visit but Sadiq is only concerned with the muslims.
t1_dskl7fh	0	*	Yeah I need some sources for that
t1_dsm4fn1	0	*	Because the provinces are full of backwoods Tory voting Brexiteers who are subsidised by London's economy.
t1_dskphh5	1	*	and then it got stupider 
t1_dskvymp	0	*	It's almost as if people who live in a city can vote someone in...  *WHOA*

t1_dskto9n	1	*	Correction: STABLE genius cities (lol)
t1_dskl4t5	1	*	In terms of money 60b isn't that much on the face of it. The damage is in other sectors that i'm not smart enough to understand. 
t1_dsllx8c	1	*	Trumps shit claims about MAGA are a lie anyway. He's defended Russia by saying the US has done terrible things, so no one should talk bad about his Russian ties.
t1_dsl8lef	1	*	[Here's a Harmony Korine documentary about it, apparently taped off Channel 4.](https://youtu.be/Ki5fRls2uv4)
t1_dsl4ncw	1	*	But simultaneously, if Trump declares war on a country or pulls us out of a trade deal, that is speaking for us. He is informing the world of the will of the people.
t1_dskte6z	1	*	I got halfway through reading your comment but then all the radical Muslims in London shut the internet down and made me grow a beard.
t1_dskwdch	1	*	Right out of Richard Spencer's playbook.
t1_dskp5yl	1	*	Like Naboo from the Mighty Boosh?
t1_dskxp5v	1	*	Fox news would just take a pic of the protestors and say they were there to support Trump. Reality has no meaning to these people. 
t1_dsljm4x	1	*	It's almost on par with fox news.
t1_dskxcwb	0	*	its because our country is 60% white, dw you will get there

t1_dskyn3a	1	*	Unfortunately cultures bring their grotesque practices to the UK. It's not the British way. Hence my comment about MGM in the US. At least we are trying to end it.
t1_dsrh0s6	1	*	I live in the UK there are no Sharia zones that's all bullshit scare mongering.
t1_dskpf0v	1	*	It was a huge deal in the 2000 election
t1_dskld4n	0	*	Go join one of the liberal scream at the sky festivals. I'm sure people will take you more seriously then.

t1_dskitja	1	*	More likely to get shot in America.
t1_dskwlbw	1	*	This is why the false equivalence between brexit and the election of trump is just absurd.   We unfortunately voted to leave the EU, but nobody can even pretend any of us would have voted for *that*. 
t1_dskp2qn	1	*	Well technically he beat the lizard people,  ya know if you're crazy. 
t1_dsko8hn	1	*	Well we here at le reddit speak at least 6-7 languages so shame on you.

t1_dskoy1x	1	*	Ah, so he's in charge of police budgets and not the home secretary. Gotcha.

t1_dsldskj	1	*	Who is letting in unvetted refugees? Neither the US or UK do that.
t1_dskvyg3	1	*	Former presidents are still called president, you know. You can't respect the office so much if you question his legitimacy and won't give him the respect of calling him by his given name. 
t1_dskujqy	0	*	Real Americans support their country. If my president is harming it, then this tribal idea of respecting those in charge blindly falls flat

t1_dsldy0l	1	*	You had a point?
t1_dskmgmj	0	*	Trump has lost all but his core base in this last year. He no longer has the support if independents, so no, i think were pretty safe. I don't think 35% is anywhere near enough to reelect him. 
t1_dskmblz	1	*	That was because America was sexist instead. :D
t1_dsknpph	1	*	Kinda like [Worf without the honour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5c2etjMl3WM)

t1_du81lvb	1	*	They want peaceful colonialism.  Most people don't want war, they just want the natives to stop fighting back.
t1_du7wq1q	0	*	its similar to the gun control debate in the USA.  its split 50/50, but...  anti-gun types will still vote for a pro-gun representative, but not vice versa.
t1_du7apou	0	*	Seeing how they're heavily armed, willing to kill and can absolutely rely on terrorists taking up arms for them on top of it, I'd say that option is right out under all circumstances.
t1_du809ze	1	*	Same reason for why the regressive faction of Republicans here do cheerleading for the regressive factions of right-winged politicians around the world: to spread their ideology.

t1_dv01on4	1	*	Imagine 3x5 cards with each utterance, pinned to a wall, with string connecting the dots. And it still makes no sense.

t1_duyylc5	1	*	Trump makes George W look like Hemingway 
t1_duykgmm	1	*	Can you link sources or something? You cant just say stuff like this without sources. Just naming people or organizations doesnt help. We need links. 
t1_dv03l90	1	*	And I'm depressed. Good lord this is sad.
t1_duyl5jb	1	*	Ford pardoning Nixon does not mean that Nixon was above the law. The president can pardon any citizen; that's a a legal process, not an extralegal one.
t1_duzw6k1	1	*	It's simple, this was a time where putin was just a leader. It's no different than when obama met putin and had a good time too.
t1_duykpqs	0	*	But strangely common: /r/trumpcriticizestrump

t1_dv03uo6	1	*	I was kinda thinking the same thing there, bud.
t1_dv03zqy	1	*	An extremely intelligent, charismatic poet! I can't believe how bad I thought the prospect of a Mitt Romney presidency was just a few years ago. 
t1_duyiboo	1	*	And then they immediately walked that back. 
t1_duyn754	1	*	It kind of like the Simpsons exploring all tropes on TV. Trump has being twitting so much that he's likely said something about everything.
t1_duyjnpb	0	*	Yeah, The Daily Mail is about as pop-right as you get here in the UK.
t1_duyy5jx	0	*	They always get the small fish but never the big one...Look at Nixon. 
t1_duylosf	1	*	When they were knocked out - easy peasy.
t1_duyurxy	0	*	And hopefully you'll understand that you twats parroting this shit in every trump-focused news story is just as fucking pedantic and meaningless as any of those comments you're supposedly satirizing.
t1_duz6w8p	0	*	No, but i hope you can show me.
t1_duyigaa	0	*	Ahhh, the mating call of the intentionally ignorant
t1_duyj5g4	0	*	> Everyone who doesn't speak perfect English is a Russian!  What kind of dumb logic is this?

t1_dv0e2kn	1	*	Pu-chan daisuki!
t1_duyly26	0	*	only if it's from the POTUS account I believe. I'm not sure if tweets from his real DonaldTrump account would be considered official Presidential statements.
t1_duyi5dt	1	*	Also 'Russian' instead of 'Russians'
t1_duymcpb	0	*	I think it's also that he was with his wife while indulging in prostitutes 
t1_duz5jf7	0	*	Umm... what? So, youre telling me that when someone decides to say, I dunno, run for President they spontaneously do it with no planning at all? Wow, I never knew!

t1_duylupq	1	*	I think this is a much more likely scenario..
t1_duz5yco	1	*	That made me laugh a lot more than it should have.
t1_duyznr2	1	*	Heh, It was her turn because the DNC chose her
t1_duyt0gm	1	*	 Yep. He's utterly guilty, but you're right, he's such a fucking piece of shit he lies about everything, even when there's absolutely no need or benefit. 
t1_dt3x33n	0	*	If you can't be part of the solution there is plenty of money to be made prolonging the problem.

t1_dsyhmhf	1	*	her (?) twitter is about the only thing I miss from my 'twitter days'! 
t1_dsygpnz	1	*	Truly one of the best accounts on Twitter if you're looking to passively learn about IT with a dash of humor. And corn. 
t1_dsyi2u4	0	*	Hush now! Go and take your cyberdongs with you, by the command of Lord Commander Guilliman.
t1_dsyskz9	0	*	Would have been funnier if you said release him into the Mi6's care, because it makes no sense as to why a British judge would give him into the CIA's care.
t1_dsyqb0a	1	*	It's a shame, since social engineering can be fun if not used to be a cunt.
t1_dsyic62	1	*	Ahem, the world as i know it about hacking from watchdogs 2 would like a word and a couple of shrooms with you. Also Rob zombie will show up
t1_dsyfr6f	1	*	/r/itsaunixsystem

t1_dsyaqdh	1	*	Fucking lengendary!
t1_dsydncc	1	*	Seriously why is every hacker protrayed as someone in a hoodie. Is it because neo had a hoodie on during the matrix? I don't even remember if he had a hoodie on.

t1_dt1k8aw	1	*	Health insurance is added, dems voted against it because theyre more worried about trying to protect illegal aliens.
t1_dt1kidn	1	*	 In the proposal by Trump most would not be deported . The cut off would be the ones who have become adults without trying to become citizens .

t1_due8q9c	0	*	90,000 to 120,000 a year is an amazing wage. If you make 6 figures I consider that rich.

t1_dtxubo0	1	*	Is the day named after the sound the dildo made when it hit his face?  That's a holiday I can get behind.
t1_dtxiobu	1	*	I wouldn't call him dumb. He's a politician, admitting that he was ever wrong would basically be career suicide. Hence the double standards. 
t1_dtxbhn9	1	*	Right there with you m8. My mid size (6kish) south-west town is full of fuckheads, I don't want them representing the entirely of Australia.
t1_dtx628h	1	*	Starting tomorrow! I can't stop laughing now. Thank you.
t1_dtx1d61	1	*	I'd rather not.
t1_dv5wxsz	1	*	Have you got a source on that?  I always thought it to be true but have had trouble sourcing it.  Churchill was full of clever one-liners.  
t1_dv0m051	0	*	It was a stylistic choice, boyzone.  And defensive of people? That phrase doesn't even make sense. How can I be defensive of people?
t1_duhukn3	1	*	Yep, all of those. I also went to the Louvre last year and saw three Chinese tourists purposefully touching paintings. Another guy tripped and caught himself by palming his entire hand on the art.

t1_dui7xyo	0	*	The primary driver of healthcare should be healthcare, not profits. 
t1_duikziz	1	*	Not everyone is for sale. There would surely be companies who will do it for the good of mankind rather thn to make a nice sale.
t1_duknfs5	1	*	This is literally the worst thing in American healthcare.   From this single fact stems nearly all of the United States' healthcare pricing woes.
t1_duhq160	1	*	Two massive spendings for big pharma : marketing and buying out smaller companies. 
t1_ds1ycec	0	*	The side where Jews and Muslims coexist in peace. If you don't know the answer or think they are both equally bad, then you either are purposefully ignorant or never visited the country.

t1_dtq2itq	1	*	There aren't any tariffs. There are only subsidies (like FITs). You're probably thinking about the States. 
t1_dtq3rk0	1	*	I'm disappointed in my fellow Yorkshiremen. 
t1_dtqd8j5	0	*	Bottled water probably shouldn't be as cheap as it is. I don't think that's too controversial. At least the bottles are recyclable. 
t1_dsm8nys	1	*	I believe he'll be in the $100 billion club by the end of the year. He was worth around $30-40 billion a year or two ago and has almost doubled that in a really small time.
t1_dut8vfw	0	*	>contribution   I mean they sell really great products that make people incredibly productive 
t1_dv4pwe2	0	*	I mean, I agree you shouldn't be painting the entire country as one thing but it is definitely not a small minority.

t1_dv4ukh1	1	*	> If Kushner goes bankrupt he loses everything...       I know a near-billionaire (750M+) who went bankrupt.     He literally just bought a 10M house.      Rich folks dont lose much.
t1_dv4ss4f	1	*	You're right man.
t1_dv4s2wu	1	*	I believe its because they take inspiration from the federalists or something
t1_dv5nnae	1	*	But there's no point to even discuss giving him the benefit of the doubt since it clearly does not apply.
t1_dv4wyj4	1	*	I think thats a misreading of what was a clear shot across the bow of the saudi elite by the new ruler. I can and will do whatever the fuck I want and you do not have the ability to stop me.
t1_dv4sjgb	0	*	>if Kushner goes bankrupt he loses everything   who wouldve thought 
t1_dv5mfuh	1	*	> it doesnt matter if you know a gift etc wont affect your decisions  It also doesn't matter if you know it won't either, because you don't really know this.

t1_dv4xhgu	1	*	Jared got bit by a radioactive Amway representative

t1_dtynyc7	1	*	I think youd be surprised.  Correction: I think you WILL be surprised

t1_dsfcwuk	0	*	I guess one could argue Trump has a bigger effect because the US has a much bigger impact on press in general. While others damage free press in their countries, Trump is a global threat.

t1_dsciecf	0	*	How is abusing a couple their newborn baby remotely critical
t1_dscd4v9	1	*	To me that's the best way to integrate more diversity in our media, especially stuff that's aimed at children. Don't sensationalize it, don't make it a big deal, just normalize it.

t1_dsccqc2	1	*	Well technically Hitler gained german citizenship in 1932, so...
t1_dsd2cvm	1	*	> considering the massive increase in violence and rape by Muslim migrants.  Most muslims I know have never been sentencted or accused for rape. I don't know what you are talking about.

t1_dukmxtl	1	*	Thats it... The trees just got 10 ft higher!! 
t1_duo4m6o	1	*	So your saying that by letting people keep more of their money and letting them volunteer their resource to plant millions of trees, he's a dictator?  That makes no sense. 
t1_dukkqv2	1	*	Lol his speaking ability is profound! 
t1_duo4htb	0	*	Are we naming things after Hitler though?  Nope, Trump is the reason that a lot of good things are happening.
t1_dukk5dr	0	*	There is no such thing as clean coal! Why we arent all on breeder reactors these days baffles me... we have had the tech since the 90s I think 
t1_duk5ksl	1	*	Here's lesson one:  It's band together, not ban together. You can go back to spitting tobacco in your coal mine now.
t1_dukh4vs	1	*	That's one way to look at it for sure : )
t1_dukcp72	1	*	too bad his words can't also be fertilizer for the trees.
t1_duv1cjv	1	*	and they've always been wrong
t1_duk8d0p	0	*	~~40000~~  Edit: nope
t1_duka8p7	1	*	Ayyy 
t1_dtgofqk	0	*	The Light has betrayed me!
t1_dtgrxc1	1	*	Dat post-shot music is spot on.
t1_dtgs423	1	*	But how do I show people how manly I am if I cant kill anything?
t1_dtgphkm	1	*	Yeah your brain doesn't work normally if you even want to do that.
t1_dtgs039	1	*	uuhh i can't find video but a while back i watched a guy hunt a deer with just gloves on. It was like watching a damn street fight. He got a big a gash on his arm but he won.  
t1_dtgse8n	0	*	Care to share?
t1_dtgrrph	0	*	Don't really need to argue anything, the guy has low morals and it got him killed.
t1_dth16mi	1	*	Well said and I couldn't agree more 
t1_dtgtb1h	1	*	My ancestors swam in a soup of primoridal ooze but you don't see me having campfires by no damn lions 
t1_dtgsmnz	1	*	True, but most people donating aren't sending anywhere near $10k. 
t1_dtgrbmv	0	*	Are you referring to the guy who killed the cunt or the people complaining in the comments. We cant change African law.
t1_dtijijw	1	*	You're assuming that most people are aware of those types and contexts. I admire your optimism.  Trouble is that OP spoke of the irony scale, singular.
t1_dtgru7k	1	*	I laughed...I don't know why, but I laughed.
t1_dthg2ge	1	*	I've absolutely overlooked the state of corruption in third world countries
t1_dtgrh0f	0	*	He's wearing a Nazi SS field cap. 
t1_dtiji0s	0	*	Because 'dramatic irony', while a recognised term, unhelpfully implies that structural ironies are confined to theatrical contexts, which they are not.
t1_dtgs1qq	0	*	Have you had it aged in white oak barrels yet?
t1_dtgtiv5	1	*	thank you so much for this extra level of validation for my opinion
t1_dtgs9fp	1	*	Nope. The Simpsons referenced it from a book called The Most Dangerous Game be Richard Connell. It's an older book. It's used to be a book people had to read in high school.
t1_dtgrzvw	1	*	Heyyy I'm a big game hunter!
t1_dtgthun	1	*	I did not say what this guy was doing is honorable.  It is just not worthy of a death sentence or for people to be happy with his death.
t1_dtgpsw0	1	*	Agreed
t1_dtgsvvf	0	*	And? Would you rather he be out poaching? I don't see why this is a problem. Sure, it's lazy hunting, but he did not deserve to die. You are extremely hyperbolic 
t1_dtgstof	0	*	So are you, sir.
t1_dtgruyh	1	*	Yeah. Non-hunters could do that. But apparently don't, as most of the money comes from hunters.  The same is true here in NL for fishing licences. 
t1_dtlx0po	1	*	Thanks for clearing that up. I hope it's true and the money doesn't disappear in some politician's pocket most of the time. 
t1_dtgrd20	0	*	Are you talking about burgers or hunting?
t1_dtgs7az	1	*	nah.
t1_dtgsf0m	1	*	You really don't understand how the world works do you lol
t1_dtgru1d	1	*	Now that you say it that way, yes
t1_dtgsbzx	1	*	Nope! Some species are a [declared pest.](http://www.environment.gov.au/node/16678)
t1_dtgmx5e	1	*	You. I like you.
t1_dtgrqvc	1	*	People are cheering on the death of thousands of lions though. I have 0 symphaty for anyone that hunts animals for fun. They are dangerous sociopaths.
t1_dt3znqt	1	*	I'm more interested in hot Dale!
t1_dt40qic	1	*	But the Japanese and Indian Ocean earthquakes were also a very particular quake where the earth shook up and down rather than side to side (which is what this one did). 
t1_dt3xkla	1	*	Just got cancelled for Hawaii. Time for some sleep.
t1_dt3y2yn	1	*	Ask a stranger, make a friend, it's an emergency, they'll understand.
t1_dt447bz	1	*	Still need to update the cancelled warning: https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/7sdc17/m_80_earthquake_in_alaska/dt3z4z7/?context=2
t1_dt3xork	1	*	I mean it already hit the us.
t1_dt3yq0m	1	*	After being in Alaska for so long I'm used to living life on the edge 
t1_dt3y9wh	1	*	How much did you love or hate the movie The Proposal? 
t1_dt3welp	0	*	That's what I was thinking too, but it's still freaky! I hope people see this warning. It pushed through on Chrome.
t1_dt3yvof	0	*	I would say so, but they dont effect as many people because many areas in Alaska are remote and sparsely populated.   [ring of fire ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_of_Fire) 
t1_dt3yvmr	1	*	Nah, there's oil in Alaska
t1_dt3yzf3	1	*	Alaska voted Trump.  As a Republican told me, a New Yorker, after 9/11 - Why do you expect the President to care about you if you didn't vote for him?  He was dead serious, too.
t1_dt40oco	1	*	I could not imagine, maybe in my worst nightmare. 
t1_dt3yeab	1	*	Tsunami is a wave, just a really big one.  Sea level goes back to normal after it's over. 
t1_dt3yev7	0	*	You mean Wavelength no? The wave amplitude determines the height/size of the wave. 
t1_ds4k2s0	1	*	Edit auto spelling
t1_dtocrqo	0	*	Shes losing her job because they arnt going to pay a model to do those other duties now they are going to pay someone else far less
t1_dtocjw2	0	*	So youre saying the employees will no longer be paid according to their appearance, but rather their ability? Oh. Right so.
t1_du81h8a	0	*	... so what was your point?
t1_du87qg5	0	*	Spying against Iran? No problem. But could you please point out where the atomic wave -sensing lizard-thing has been used? As a biologist I'm pretty interested in that...
t1_dtax2fp	1	*	It was fine when thousands of Jihadis flocked into Syria through Turkey too.
t1_dux274m	1	*	By cars, I did mean non-electric vehicles. I specifically say combustion engines later in the comment. I'll go ahead and edit for clarity.
t1_dstrz1f	1	*	I've thought of the same thing about Gavrilo Princip. One guy triggers essentially two world wars and the deaths of millions and millions of people.
t1_dstn6c2	0	*	Well I sincerely hope your day goes a little better than it must be going so far.
t1_dt63rlh	1	*	You sound like an old dude who likes to pull their dicks out in front of unsuspecting chicks.  
t1_dt6b8ph	1	*	Sexual advances like the ones listed in the article require express consent not ambiguity and innuendo.
t1_dtfs3zr	0	*	They are sadly few and far between.  Edit: Down voted for agreeing with the guy above? U0001f914
t1_dtg1r3g	1	*	Google Piplineistan
t1_dulebhk	0	*	Swedes aren't the only ones who can smell bullshit, you know.  Unless, of course, TIL I'm Swedish.
t1_duqfdbq	0	*	It'll he affected by it. If the gulf stream fades it'll get colder in a good portion of Europe. Ever notice how it's further North than comparable climates in the USA? 
t1_dupjvuv	0	*	The chairs are very weak. Very weak chairs. I could not sit all day in this chair.
t1_dupvut8	1	*	Yes I just read it on Google. Seems I was incorrect however, they do seem willing to invest in newer technologies and science than most other countries.
t1_dupgf1s	0	*	well it wouldn't be the first time the US has had to step in between european wars
t1_duph5fs	0	*	https://www.nationaldebtclocks.org/debtclock/germany
t1_dupi6zv	1	*	Not entirely true, it depends on sports. 
t1_dupibqq	1	*	But you guys can have the rest of ours. It's still good, I promise.
t1_duphq51	1	*	It wasn't a german built wall tbh
t1_duprc99	1	*	And still we are doing great. Makes you think, he? 
t1_dupl43b	1	*	Likely referencing the insane president.
t1_dupjfsp	0	*	Whats your beef? 
t1_dupjn7p	1	*	They wash it first.  In fact I understand that they use a lot of lignite, which is the lowest grade coal and is worst of emissions.
t1_dupgx01	0	*	It's not like North Korea can afford to have nukes, but they still do have them. 
t1_duq8661	0	*	Netzminister Seehofer ich kotze
t1_dupjg9d	1	*	Quite a reactionary move
t1_duplzva	0	*	Yes, I'm aware. I was making a joke.
t1_duqd0l3	1	*	Taxes work on a bracket system; only the money they make over the bracket number gets taxed at that rate. If someone makes 55,000 that is only 2,112 that gets taxed at 42%. 
t1_dupkojr	1	*	I hope the plan isnt to establish us, as Germany, as a super power.   I hope the plan is to elevate the whole EU to a level where we have a bit more leverage on the diplomatic floor.
t1_dupscpp	0	*	>last time  >annual  >few years back  Hmmm
t1_dupxpvg	1	*	I made a side trip from Koln specifically to ride that. Saw it in the movie The Princess and the Warrior. 
t1_dupgtm3	1	*	A little of column 1, a little of column 2.  
t1_dupxlj4	0	*	The us spends way too much on the military. As for ss that could be reduced by boosting the retirement age 
t1_duppo8k	0	*	Careful. We've got laws against this kind of hate speech!^^/s
t1_dur8ney	1	*	It's pretty much the reason for the surplus.
t1_dupxcsu	1	*	Yeah true, most parties just have an allergic reaction to anything regarding the military that isn't lowering its funding.
t1_dupg5rz	1	*	Both Europeans and Americans too. 
t1_duq1594	1	*	Italy gave them some, but I couldn't find any from Germany.
t1_duppuke	0	*	I'm pretty sure they already have better education, infrastructure and technology compared to most other countries, but yes it does need more funding
t1_duptkm8	0	*	You shouldn't stand under a tree during a storm, it's dangerous.
t1_duphxuu	1	*	Whoever I agree with is a reasonable compatriot. Whoever I disagree with is a Russian robot. 
t1_durk8ti	1	*	Multiple.
t1_duq37xc	1	*	Holland? :)

t1_dupgjrq	0	*	I can still see your face.
t1_dupmpnc	0	*	The only way is an European army. That army per country bullshit is doomed to fail
t1_duqihh7	1	*	They basically provide your military protection. Im not supporting it, but theres no denying that they help Germany out in that department. 
t1_dupqe8c	1	*	Belgium??
t1_dupsnwx	1	*	> They're working less because machines can do more- that's what higher productivity means.  That's one very narrow avenue to higher productivity, there are countless others.
t1_duq3m8g	1	*	Augustiner is indeed excellent. I buy it once in a while. (From Baden Wurttemberg)
t1_duphys1	0	*	Just say you are a refugee /s
t1_dupte73	1	*	Still doesn't make it a good thing. Also, Obama took the deficit from 1T down to 200B, now we're back to 1T in 12 months. 
t1_duporuw	1	*	Well yeah, you built a wall in the middle of your capital for some reason.  Walls are supposed to go along borders.  
t1_duq0ndu	1	*	Gotta beat Obama at everything.
t1_duptkjj	1	*	germany gives lots of money to greek. Surely this might be an investment to stop a downfall of the eu, but anyway it still is the factor why greek is still in austerity and not bankrupt.
t1_duq7fyv	1	*	One Trillion. 
t1_dupkrv8	0	*	Why be in favor of using debt that future generations have to pay for? Why not just bite the bullet and pay for it yourself?
t1_duph52f	1	*	I was speaking on a global level but sure. Keep scream uncle sam whenever a rusty Russian plane enters your airspace.  Thats respectable. 
t1_duppqhc	0	*	Proof? Because you moved the goalpost and just put the limelight on your ignorance again.
t1_duptay3	1	*	> we already tried that once.  I thought it was The Soviet Union that built the Berlin Wall. The wall around the Vatican seems to be doing well though.
t1_dupl7i3	1	*	> every time I hear that U.S. subsidizes European defense I want to punch the redditor who wrote it in the face for stupidity  The irony is strong with this one.
t1_dupztfh	1	*	Deutschland Fxf6rster.
t1_dupfqsh	1	*	Isn't it from the film Independence Day?
t1_dupzkou	0	*	You have a way with words.
t1_dupqhle	1	*	I only started watching some hockey un the olympics but didnt have the earlier olympics have NHL players in them? Still very surprising that germany is in the final.
t1_dupgowh	0	*	> They specifically talk about your broken healthcare systems as examples the US do not want to follow.   I'd rather DIE than have socialist health care
t1_dupnhef	1	*	It's gonna start trickling down any day now
t1_dupl4r9	0	*	The US forces in Germany absolutely benefit Germany more. Those bases bring in huge amounts of money for the local economy.
t1_dupk1nw	0	*	Perhaps try to not build the wall in the middle of the capital this time? Maybe a little further to the east?
t1_dupm1nb	1	*	I was talking about that one lol.
t1_dus6yfd	1	*	One of them was smart and pretending otherwise is plan delusion.
t1_dupcyzz	0	*	Military expenditures are the most useless sort. Until they **really fucking aren't**.
t1_dupm9em	0	*	You should study Just War Theory it may change your mind a little
t1_dupjsh8	1	*	Get out.
t1_dupk0jk	1	*	Except we have proof that they're incompatible. Watch world news and you'll see it quickly 
t1_duq854t	0	*	From  Calgary. Have an up vote. 
t1_duqjdwo	1	*	Their Tornado feet has been grounded due to biofuel contamination too.
t1_duprj71	0	*	I know, i forgot the sarcasm in my comment.
t1_duplp3p	1	*	Germany is being propped up by the EU and shared currency. Governments should run a deficit, only reason why Germany isn't is because they're letting the rest of the EU run one for them.
t1_dupljyu	0	*	You can't rely on the police when you need them either.  At the most recent school shooting there was a fucking cop at the school and he ran and hid while children were being murdered.
t1_dupuzdf	0	*	I hear the train is awfully loud
t1_dupv7jo	1	*	Wasn't really us though. By saying that it was more or less demanded by the russians.
t1_duppg5y	0	*	Only 50 more years of surplus and they are in the black!
t1_dupot0l	0	*	I thought you said palpatine and I was wondering why r/PrequelMemes was leaking into this
t1_dupjjd1	1	*	Are you a college student? 
t1_duphrci	1	*	California xdcber Alles
t1_dupsdqq	1	*	So you are implicitly pro nuclear proliiferation? Right, lets get all nations nuclear weapons and we will have perpetual peace.
t1_duphwxa	0	*	so was his comment
t1_duprflp	0	*	Did you say sorry?
t1_duqffaw	0	*	Which is why it didnt need a stimulus that increased wealth inequality.
t1_duprcwt	0	*	You're high if you think American has better beer then Germany
t1_dupjijh	0	*	Blame the idiot redneck conservatives in Alberta for squandering our wealth away...
t1_dupot7p	0	*	You didn't refute his point?
t1_dupi3jf	1	*	It'll start trickling anytime now...
t1_dupgl8t	0	*	This is entirely irrelevant.  
t1_dupk0de	1	*	Yet here you and I are, both not Russians, discussing this... or IS one of us a Russian... :X
t1_dupud2c	0	*	They are illegals because your government can spend two years, fiddling with papers before letting them in.   When their country is in a war, they do not have time for your bureaucracy.  
t1_duplcrs	0	*	Trump is something we would call Witzfigur in Germany.
t1_dupgn6t	1	*	It has more to do with America rebuilding them with the Marshal Plan.
t1_duq7bmu	1	*	not immigrants, but refugees. my bad. 
t1_dupjmpd	1	*	Hey David, I need your help I don't know what to do with the surplus 
t1_dupz8sx	1	*	My aunt is from Wuppertal. I've been on that every time we're there. Something about an elephant. 
t1_duprm20	0	*	No way in hell they are the only ones...
t1_dur3csv	1	*	An uneducated opinion, bordering at sensationalism. The end is neigh. Haha.  You do not sound any smarter though. That's what makes me think you're not very smart?!
t1_dupxslx	1	*	Thats because you built down the middle of your country.  
t1_dupjll4	0	*	It's hilarious how badly the people downvoting this comment got whooshed.
t1_dupvzu4	0	*	Weizen is better than wit beer. Fight me
t1_dupr8uz	1	*	What? You might want to visit Europe every once in a while. Businesses operated by immigrants are the exception.
t1_dupqv9t	0	*	I didn't defend our wars, just pointing out that without the military spending of the U.S. Germany wouldn't have just been stuck behind an iron curtain, they would be a functioning part of it.
t1_dupj1vy	1	*	I guess they used fiber cables so it won't be outdated in the future.
t1_duq2heu	1	*	$6.735B
t1_duq3ayw	1	*	Yeah I don't get why they did it either given that he has mega cash.  Just saying this just doesn't matter. SA is in serious trouble on multiple fronts...this just doesn't matter in that context.
t1_dupgxzl	0	*	A large chunk of those immigrants are from Poland, right?
t1_dupwwcj	0	*	Our crash-course is just extremely efficient.
t1_duq4y9y	0	*	It's. A. Star. Wars. Reference.
t1_dupjmbr	0	*	>And i don't think anyone should ever be paying 60% in taxation.  Literally no German pays 60% in taxation. 
t1_duppkby	1	*	Fair enough.
t1_duphj9j	1	*	No worries, no one wants war and it seems ever more unlikely a war between super powers would happen. Both sides know it would be just a waste where both will lose. 
t1_dupi5j5	1	*	lol @ u
t1_duqrf1w	1	*	Not just low, we even had some negative interest rates. Which means the banks pay us to lend us money.
t1_dupyg0i	0	*	You could probably stand to lose 50 lbs.  Sounds like a win-win.  
t1_dupppr3	0	*	We also have some horrible microbrews too, lots of them. Germany does have a few shitty beers, but the standards of quality overall are much higher.
t1_dur2kbr	1	*	Sure :) Why not.
t1_dupr70m	1	*	Just flee your country and they'll let you in without much trouble, a few million have tried and succeeded. 
t1_dupjrvn	1	*	With $645 at a Burlington Coat Factory....youre a king. 
t1_dupw4ls	1	*	Call it for what it is: Defense contractor wellfare
t1_dupjm5b	1	*	Just because a country has social programs doesn't mean it's a socialist country. 
t1_duq11b1	1	*	So their corrupt business practices and massive tax evasion problem isn't the cause? Greece is the cause of their own austerity and problems, not other countries.
t1_dupnqnv	1	*	It would cripple the value of the dollar
t1_duq04x0	1	*	If you didn't put conservative in that statement I would've thought you were talking about a different party, with a blue flag.
t1_duq53gu	0	*	I dont think you understand what Genocide means.
t1_dupii04	1	*	I actually didn't realize that. Thanks for the info.... still seem's hard to believe that theyll play that much of catch up since theyre at 1.19% currently. 
t1_dupooea	1	*	Tru dat 
t1_dtna1jv	1	*	It's written by nunes and Trump it's fake
t1_dtmywo6	0	*	You do know that the Seth Rich conspiracy was debunked by the Dutch intelligence service who watched the Russians hack the DNC, right?
t1_dtn6lmc	0	*	You made an empty hyperbolic insult to a generalized group of people instead of addressing anything in the memo. It is just more empty 'us-versus-them' posturing, which we are all terribly sick of.
t1_dtn2fih	1	*	There isn't anything to check, none of it matters.
t1_dthun6d	1	*	What no, not at all, that makes no sense.
t1_dt6egx5	0	*	Yeah, of course people said the same thing about jazz, rock and roll, punk, new wave, and other popular music forms 
t1_dt6cmk3	1	*	How can you say these things Bloodlust?   Is it really that simple?
t1_dt6qkk0	1	*	It's socialism with chinese characteristics
t1_ds6r5w0	0	*	Trying to get someone to concede a point to the conflicting view is like getting blood from a stone. Such is life.
t1_dssjdde	0	*	you need to make very very bad decisions to get poor once youre rich.
t1_dsrf978	1	*	Exactly. Its 50 square miles in size and is a massively funded global hub of commerce and investment and transport. Comparing Singapore to the US is like comparing Manhattan to the US.
t1_dstcx3m	1	*	Chinese, Malay and Indians are not who I was referring to by 'ethnic minorities'. How many sub-saharan Africans or Pakistanis do they have for example? LOL
t1_dssrojx	1	*	Because Thailand doesnt enforce those laws. The police will turn a blind eye for sone tea money.
t1_dsscpi3	1	*	That's the guy. I remember there being a lot noise about it. Their strict rules are not a secret, you have to be looking for trouble. Bet he learned real quick though
t1_dsx0dcq	1	*	tax form you get when you leave a job - a comedian managed to get up to her during her party conference and hand her one in the middle of her speech  
t1_dswzx5n	1	*	It's a tax summary form employees get after their employment ends 
t1_dsd5quu	1	*	Ozone is shrinking dawg, light that shit up
t1_dsd6arv	0	*	I think if we were to just put a giant mixer in the middle of the ocean we could disperse it enough that nobody would even know anything happened
t1_duvwhoe	1	*	Oh for sure, I'm not talking about everyone here. Isis had specific women only divisions in its militant ranks.
t1_dt4ye2g	0	*	Nobody said anything about just giving *those people* money though. The only point of the article is that the way things are is messed up.
t1_dt6cw2c	1	*	the only difference between faith-based religious doctrine and fake news is that religion isn't new.
t1_dt7zl8j	1	*	everything this pope has said and done has been in the true spirit of what religions are meant to be.  International criminal organizations specializing in the protection of pedophiles?
t1_dt6tpf1	0	*	Kinda like a report that claims the then elect president of the US had Russian hookers pee on him in Obama's old hotel room? Totally different, I'm sure you'll reassure me. 
t1_dt6fmuq	1	*	The Pope's a chemist. Why shouldn't he be more scientifically aware?
t1_dt7kc3j	1	*	It wasn't meant deprecating either, nor do I have a beef with religion.  It's just... a symptom of being human, in a way. 
t1_dt6gck2	1	*	Yes I'm sure being condescending wins a lot of people over.
t1_dt6i3os	0	*	He's King Pedo

t1_dt6qlnp	0	*	Boy, you atheist haters really hold onto the old insults.  As Donald Trump would say, very sad.  
t1_dt6bb1h	1	*	Plus the growing number of news source that specialize in special interest perspectives.
t1_dt6r6l4	1	*	It's nice to hear, even if he's just pretending
t1_dt6rlpf	0	*	No they dont believe you need to be a catholic when you die  to get to heaven either
t1_dt6kzyi	1	*	It's not relative/ambiguous at a certain point and we have gone way past that point. 
t1_dt6la8s	1	*	Man, he just got the kindling ability too.

t1_dugs9kz	1	*	Well, there was a peaceful transition to a dynamically distinct administration, which will again be replicated in 2-6 years.  The issue is common to any form of democracy (idiots electing idiots).
t1_duh34hp	1	*	Electoral college is rigged for sure 2nd time popular lost in 2 decades. republicans are just sore losers who have to cheat 
t1_dugrzig	1	*	Thought this said pedantic man child and was seriously confused 
t1_dugxo30	1	*	I'd take Spicey in a heartbeat over that troll in a dress that we get to listen to now.
t1_dugrkw8	1	*	Wasnt this pointed out when Gore lost?
t1_dugs5r5	1	*	If by won you mean lost, sure!
t1_dugqzoq	1	*	Those last groups where exactly the target audience for the Russian campaign.
t1_duh1jty	1	*	right, which is why the system is pretty broken.  he still won by votes though!
t1_dugqq68	0	*	Sean Spicer declaring something does not make that thing true.
t1_duh0izm	1	*	Do you feel that doubling down on identity politics and demeaning half of the country is in the parties best interest?  Is it in the nations best interest?
t1_dugq4ea	1	*	it's possible lmao
t1_dugu3bk	1	*	Senators (who are lawyers with a specialty in constitutional law) have no experience in government? 
t1_dugr7qw	0	*	I was blocked and then un blocked
t1_dugpw5g	0	*	Hear hear
t1_dugr5rt	1	*	I didn't vote for Trump, but I can see why people didn't vote for Hillary. I just didn't vote since both of them were bad options for different reasons.
t1_duh0qwe	1	*	Thats what Putin wants though
t1_duhc7bm	1	*	I mean personality wise I suppose so? Don't miss his blatant lying.
t1_dugpypp	1	*	The sky might be blue. Fire might be hot. Water might be wet. 
t1_dugyi8o	1	*	Once again, a Trumpster is triggered when publicly available information is looked at.  Bizarre.  How do you feel about someone looking into a department store window? Do you call the cops? 
t1_dugrjm0	1	*	The main flaw in the system is the status quo duopoly that controls all functions of government. That was not by design.
t1_dugkuuv	1	*	Russian oligarchs are the elite that got trump elected 
t1_dugqz73	1	*	Adequate 
t1_dugsap2	1	*	I've heard non americans describe it like watching a car crash repeatedly into a wall. For us, its like being trapped in the trunk.
t1_dugxsjv	1	*	Don't forget Pizzagate and all the other fake news.  While grab her by the pussy etc wasn't news.
t1_dugx0ck	1	*	I see him as that kidding school who desperately wants to be a cool kid. Now, he's a cool kid and will do anything to continue to be seen as cool.
t1_duh6v3b	1	*	He didnt vote on net neutrality, how can you blame that on him?
t1_dugj0ky	1	*	Yeah, the Elite are the 1% !
t1_dugqdpw	0	*	3 million is a lot actually, but maybe you don't think so because the Russian programmer that coded you used a short int and therefore 3 million overflowed and looks like a small number 
t1_dugxwvm	1	*	Well I'm a little bit country.....
t1_dugt01z	1	*	COUNTRY UNDER CONSTRUCTION!  Please excuse the dust :)
t1_dugslbd	0	*	- J.R.R Trollkien, 1675
t1_dugwrv4	0	*	Thank God it's only WaPo that makes stuff up.
t1_dugpc2m	1	*	I would rather not watch that. Hillary would at least be presidential, and do some good for the united states.
t1_dugu14x	1	*	Exaclty!
t1_dugtb9n	1	*	Its not a great system, but its the best we can do. We as the American people are trying.
t1_dugq381	0	*	How much time can it really take to tweet though?
t1_dugyh85	0	*	k
t1_duhos2u	0	*	Damn, youre on some church of scientology type of crazy, man. Way to form you own opinions, little guy.
t1_duhzvxq	1	*	It seems he was wrong if you look at the results so far and judge them by the overall well being of people across the world.
t1_dugzm7u	1	*	Stop, you are making a fool out of yourself 
t1_dugx4dx	0	*	One of few things I can agree with Trump on, I would also like to have sex with his daughter if her father wasn't Donald Trump.
t1_dugrp7h	1	*	Hilary's campaign slogan was I'm with her. That says everything you need to know about why she lost. 
t1_dugpzev	1	*	Casual locker room presidential proclamations.  They're a thing now.
t1_duh0jka	1	*	*I miss the old Spicey, chop up the truth Spicey*  *I hate the new Spicey, back in the bush Spicey*
t1_dugr84z	0	*	I dunno man. You can call the trump administration a lot things, corrupt, incompetent, embarrassing but monotonous isn't one of them. Monotony would be a welcome relief after this shit show.
t1_dugtxg9	1	*	Begging for conflict...?
t1_dugu809	1	*	I really want a flag of this now
t1_duh0fla	0	*	Monotony?  Shirley you cant be serious
t1_dugrqj3	1	*	Direct democracy sounds fucking THERAPEUTIC right about now.
t1_dugss04	1	*	Someone doesn't understand how the electoral college works.
t1_dugpsrh	1	*	Oooh look an edgy 19 year old spotted in the wild.
t1_dugpaph	0	*	There are some golden nuggets of corn in there, so long as you don't breach the kernel wall.
t1_dugztu2	0	*	Now why would anyone boycott r/superbowl?
t1_dugpqzl	0	*	3,000,000 < 1% of the population of USA  edit: USA not america
t1_dugu92h	1	*	if only most americans thought and acted like you do...
t1_dugqef0	1	*	In my view they are appallingly similar. 
t1_dugrdh0	0	*	Bill Clinton doesnt love Hillary as much as you dorks.
t1_duguqph	1	*	He's incredibly stupid.
t1_dugrlmi	1	*	As for both, they wouldn't be in the position they are if it werent for Russia and its shadow government.
t1_dugpgbv	1	*	This isn't a game show kid.
t1_dugws72	0	*	The method isn't absurd.  What he says is absurd. 
t1_dugro2r	0	*	Or is it? It's the same playing field for all candidates. Clinton just sucked at the game.
t1_dugyqpi	1	*	And again we have a Trumpeteer making up lies about his opponent's motivations.   I know it's hard to understand but I put in a lot of thought before declaring cringeanarchy a nazi safe space.  
t1_dugplde	1	*	Besides that, there is nothing elite about the sort of people that voted for Trump.
t1_duguzg5	1	*	When you assume you make an ass out of you and me.  Or Trump is an ass.  It's one of those two
t1_dugsxx9	1	*	Shouty Spice.
t1_duh029u	0	*	No it's fucking not.
t1_dugqpjv	1	*	Not its not. If you had any knowledge at all on our electoral system you would know that popular vote is not an actually representation of what the population thinks.
t1_dugtz89	0	*	No I meant the same elite that writes the laws and legislation you speak so fondly of. 
t1_dugufly	1	*	Stable genius, etc. He's often spoken about how brilliant he is because nobody else is going to say it. Where've you been for the last (terrible) year?
t1_dugtka0	1	*	It is. But to be fair this happens in quite a few place like the UK. First past the post systems do not work anymore, too many people live in tiny space. (Cities.)
t1_dugvkrl	0	*	DDG gets their results from other search engines like Google. 
t1_dugsq4y	1	*	we - must have voted for Trump...
t1_dui0zd8	1	*	Historically speaking, disarmed countries have mostly resulted in mass government exterminations.
t1_dugwmkn	1	*	No. It doesn't say anything of the sort. 
t1_dugufbl	0	*	I would argue that our system was setup by the elite and is still mantained by the elite.  We can all agree that powerful people have... power... on both sides!
t1_dugrpka	1	*	I think our server is a steaming hunk of melted parts at this point.
t1_duh1rnl	1	*	The system doesn't account for half the voting population deciding to not to vote in the election.
t1_dugnett	0	*	/r/keep_track
t1_dugqpom	0	*	Easier to keep track of a shitshow when you're a QualityAsshole.
t1_dugza5q	1	*	1. Yes. 2. IANAL but I would imagine yes. 3. He denies all the dumb shit he says anyway.
t1_dugvkkk	1	*	Well if you love him...set him free. Atleast when it all collapses he will be far far away and free.
t1_dugtle1	1	*	Yeah, we should vote to change it.  Oh, wait.
t1_dugqjou	1	*	Mind your own business, USA is still #1
t1_ds8exr2	1	*	all according to keikaku:  >A serious problem in planning against American doctrine is that the Americans do not read their manuals, nor do they feel any obligation to follow their doctrine.
t1_dtjr6hk	0	*	They're both in Belgium though. 
t1_dtccqm5	0	*	I understand your point, but does it not make more sense to say German Death Camps instead of Polish ones? It wasn't the polish people right...
t1_duuglbf	1	*	Yes, this works very well in the US.
t1_dusztwu	0	*	Immigration is probably a factor to consider as well. Although, that's just conjecture on my part. 
t1_dutvgkf	0	*	He edited that.
t1_dtb2rel	1	*	Ha, makes sense
t1_dv44l22	1	*	I agree. It's pie-in-the-sky SF.
t1_dv2bpry	0	*	He owned a cafe. does that make him an entrepreneur?? pretty low bar if you ask me
t1_dscwdfl	0	*	Oh god, how many marihuanas have you injected already?!
t1_dtxwipu	0	*	Because she didnt have to rely on Russian tampering to win his election. He used good ole American tampering.
t1_dtxyiui	1	*	So a standard republican just doing what republicans do.
t1_dtd5hc6	0	*	Found one in the passenger side map pocket in my car the other day.  Why in the hell was it in the car?
t1_dt5d43g	1	*	Ah, I misunderstood.
t1_du21m2a	0	*	Oh for fucks sake don't be dumb 
t1_du7gnd2	1	*	Hahaha
t1_dt2anpl	1	*	To be fair, it will be a double barrel.
t1_dt3br4z	1	*	Original Comment 
t1_dt34ly0	0	*	My bad - I had it in my head that silver was more valuable than gold, but that's platinum, not silver.
t1_dt2ay6v	0	*	Thats so 1998 Russia. He will kill himself with anti-aircraft gun. 
t1_duxgirp	0	*	You should have stopped after the first seven words of your reply. 
t1_dtla8cq	1	*	Dude, it is fine to dislike China and call for its' dismemberment, but there is no need to be racist about it.
t1_dtlervn	1	*	Same - I love reading about military tech. If we don't hear anything about this one in the coming months though, I guess assume it was a failure. 
t1_dtne08w	0	*	We did invent a shit load of things that revolutionized the world, lets not forget that.
t1_dtla8ps	0	*	> That's 1.5% to 5% of the cost of a missile  And the cost of all the subsystems necessary to fire both?  How do they compare?  
t1_dtluejx	1	*	> stockpile of explosives on a boat.  Even without a gun this is an issue, Missiles are a thing.
t1_dtl922b	1	*	Hey now, we're not at war with China, no need to wish for hundreds of Chinese sailors to needlessly die.
t1_dtlypvm	1	*	Finally someone who gets it. 
t1_dtlryzr	1	*	Harmless nerf balls filled with melamine laced explosives.
t1_dtmnm00	1	*	You understand where I was going with that, then.
t1_dsdbicd	0	*	That has a lot to do with the fact that those countries have less income and wealth inequality and better social mobility than the US. Poverty and hopelessness breeds crime.
t1_duwenrr	0	*	Are you talking about the Navalny with more than 2million twitter followers? Or a different one that nobody knows about?
t1_duvee99	0	*	It isn't https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_exchange_rate
t1_dupce81	1	*	Yeah but who cares about that lame shit? Especially when we have guns!  Pew pew!
t1_dtvdlun	1	*	Oh yeah, that's correct. It seems like I didn't skim the whole article.
t1_dtvqp0u	1	*	True, but not exactly setting a high bar there. 
t1_duckr2v	0	*	It's not stolen if consent was given.
t1_duckpo9	0	*	Cuz they didn't need to.  It was cheaper to import the balls than to develop the tech.
t1_dubv52x	0	*	Assuming he is American, or western, then China is the enemy
t1_dud0wvj	0	*	Did you just compare IP theft to dismantling a colonial trade monopoly? Feckin' hell, people have a human right to free trade.
t1_duc8drl	1	*	The dude is white knighting so hard for china.
t1_dud0tyo	1	*	Cheap labor is more likely to be automated. Its already happening, with American manufacturing on the rise, but manufacturing jobs in decline. 
t1_duf6gtz	1	*	Who is us?
t1_dubrow8	1	*	It is about being allowed to sell their products on the domestic market.
t1_duct860	0	*	Because China signed an agreement that said it wouldnt. 
t1_dudg6z2	1	*	you living in last century, aren't you? 
t1_dud0qse	1	*	If the English are a nation of shopkeepers, America is a nation of salesmen
t1_ds1e299	0	*	> The Nazi's didn't boycott the Jews  [Yes](https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/mobile/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005678) they did
