t1_dufijqv	1	*	[kosovo?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosovo) maybe you want to clarify what you are hinting at?
t1_duk1i1g	0	*	Lying is why Canada deported all those North Korean refugees (quotes because they actually came from South Korea).  Should Israel be concerned?
t1_dv3pkc2	1	*	It sure is!
t1_dswmie3	0	*	Rwanda is a peaceful and progressive place now. Yeah, the scars are there but Rwanda is in no way a shitty place anymore. I would even say its pretty great.
t1_dsx7uvo	1	*	They can claim moral authority all they want, you don't have to listen or agree. But they certainly don't have to accept refugees. 
t1_dsvanuj	0	*	What's your point? 
t1_dsvxhz7	0	*	You called it propaganda, prove his video is false. A tweet from years ago doesn't disqualify this video.
t1_dtvrj8d	1	*	There was also CETA signed recently.
t1_dsntk6b	1	*	> hes an opportunist  Exactly.
t1_ds95a09	0	*	So I guess the point is that even is kinda bullshit. There could be a word for numbers divisible by 3, 4, and 5 as well. 
t1_dsa0yop	1	*	LOL, so true.
t1_ds97yg5	0	*	Exactly so he started his computer 14 years ago to search for prime numbers and the current computers verified it in less than 3 days.....still makes no sense to me why this is news worthy?

t1_ds8ydlb	1	*	Absolutely
t1_ds97cjr	1	*	Oh.  How many digits does the most widely used general-purpose pseudorandom number generator (PRNG) use?    Nevermind:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister

t1_ds9lf0h	1	*	Yeahyeah whatever
t1_ds9ffhy	0	*	I mean, it obviously is a joke.  Yeah, any factorial of factorials is gargantuan.  But any finite number is tiny anyway so it's basically small enough to ignore.
t1_ds9ahzr	1	*	you have to submit all prime factors. if there's only one, it's prime.

t1_ds93nne	0	*	O.o Thanks! Shall watch
t1_ds9h5my	1	*	Mathematicians get soo nasty when they fight
t1_dsb85kf	1	*	I mean you'd need to convey the information that that is what you're compressing it to, which would also take a couple bytes.
t1_ds9kcpa	1	*	Easy, you add up all the digits, and if the resulting number is divisible by 3, the original number was too.

t1_dti8qr1	1	*	It wasn't the ones they were looking for.. 
t1_dsfe46y	1	*	No it absolutely doesnt. What does fall apart are countries without means to protect themselves. NK is alone, hated and on contested land.
t1_dseux8x	0	*	Just because South Koreans have a better life now does not mean you get to revise history. What kind of argument was that? 
t1_dseyn88	1	*	China on the UN at the time was Taiwan. Not Communist China.
t1_dses96f	0	*	The soviets boycotted the UN at that time didnt it? Thats why the UN was actually able to send forces there. Also yeah of course they supported it, they needed the US to protect them from the commies.
t1_ds1kufa	0	*	Thanks. The false equivilencies are the worst.

t1_dv2o1rn	0	*	Maybe, but The soldiers of a military despot commit rape is sort of a dog-bites-man headline, though. Aid workers raping? That's a little more man-bites-dog.
t1_dvfz9kn	1	*	go on.   
t1_dv1li7z	1	*	You're wrong   People should be getting their aid for free, that's the aid workers fucking jobs    Blackmail and extortion is wrong

t1_dst97zs	1	*	Is he dead? We can't trust Hamas' word about this. Maybe they won't release photos or other evidence because he was killed by the violent mob. Trampling deaths do happen. 
t1_dt0mgfk	0	*	Western Europe maybe. Eastern Europe's freedom from Germans was paid for by the blood of Russians and the locals. No yankee made it this far.

t1_dtny8xo	0	*	Your comment doesn't make any sense, congratulations on wasting everybody's time.
t1_dto1cnr	0	*	Yeah, it's not like the things a person says and the communities they join say anything about them /s
t1_dtny77s	1	*	Not a Brit and a shit attempt anyway. Well done I guess.
t1_dtogj47	0	*	Has. Doesn't mean it will automatically stay that way, especially if the so-called leaders keep following economic principles designed to destroy the wealth of the bulk of those consumers.
t1_dtpmd2s	1	*	Canad'au revoir
t1_dto22kx	1	*	Whats wrong with sending your children to the Cole mine? Do you hate America you unpatriotic American. /s
t1_dto4ysq	0	*	With a contractor, you can say, Or else I'll go through someone else.  It doesn't work that way with countries.
t1_dto0qho	1	*	Completely agreed.
t1_dtocilu	1	*	Not in this economy.
t1_dtosguu	1	*	a lot of skilled professionals would come back since NAFTA allowed them to work in US.
t1_dtnyez8	1	*	hey found another t_d poster
t1_dto4gfh	1	*	China is not in TPP. And nobody is saying that you should just sign any agreement with China.
t1_dtny34v	0	*	Imperial is an inferior way to measure. 
t1_dtoayd5	1	*	Because for all I know she might have perfectly valid points. I'm not trying to argue against her post as a whole, I'm just criticizing that one specific strawman argument.
t1_dtovvyc	1	*	Mom, I find it interesting that you call *The Weekly World News* the paper. The paper contains facts.
t1_dto9abr	1	*	Canabye Felicia  FTFY
t1_dv0d18n	0	*	Don't they bite your head off?
t1_duih8yx	1	*	Exactly my point. You stopped at the first thing that agreed with your narrative.  Real minds dig not stop at the first bit of info. You couldn't even give your own research the time of day lol
t1_dumc4w7	0	*	You're being pedantic. It's a perfectly relevant discussion considering what came before.
t1_dumcwyh	1	*	why? thats not even it bro.
t1_dum4eyr	0	*	oh alright, I understand better then.
t1_dumbv0a	0	*	Wow he sounds like a monster, way worse than Putin.
t1_dump5kp	1	*	I mean being his career before politics was law and he worked in anti-corruption cases. So I'd say he's probably a bit better at it than most.
t1_dum36ti	1	*	gotcha.
t1_dtzco8l	0	*	> Throwing money at a country whose people don't really care about the well being of said country is akin to throwing money in a blender.  It was the US that fucked up the country for worse.
t1_dtzdd8c	1	*	You quoted two things directly related to the current president and then insult his/her intelligence for following your implications.   Not a very good way to get your point across, whatever that is.
t1_dtze9z7	0	*	Nah that would be the X Band Radar system in the Pacific. Almost 30B over 20 yrs for a radar with a 2 meter field of view.
t1_du004zi	1	*	Can you even read? That was not what I remarked on at all.  (13 year olds can read about the world too, btw. But still not what I was remarking on.)
t1_dtzdd2x	0	*	> We didn't really rebuild with American money  Oh cool, I'll go play in the bomb sites then
t1_dtzqb0a	0	*	> the US doesn't need middle eastern oil.  Europe is aligned with the US because it can secure ME oil to it. If it can't, Europe will align with Russia out of sheer desperation.
t1_durpkcz	1	*	Your Dm doesnt want a chaotic party, but fuck lawful.
t1_durjc8g	0	*	It's hard to make out what you're trying to say... Do you think I'm Japanese? I'm American.
t1_durz252	0	*	I am joking about the fact germans hated thr trench gun also there is no accurate in ww2 bombing
t1_durdvbb	0	*	Nah its full of holes.
t1_dussiu8	0	*	I asked if the civilians who were victims of the nuclear bombs speared babies for fun and your proof was to bring up the actions of their government.
t1_durowoz	1	*	Lets be real, he/she has never had this conversation with an American.
t1_dus46t9	1	*	The rise of people wishing to silence dissent is ever increasing.  You see it in the Philippines, on college campuses in America and in Russia.  
t1_durhsgm	0	*	They are simply doing what any nation state should do. Deny, deny and deny.
t1_dureumd	0	*	Isn't that the point? You kind of implied that the innocent civilians who died in Japan deserved it. What does the whataboutism accomplish? Any innocent loss of life is not ideal. 
t1_durg2ao	1	*	Holy insecure projection Batman
t1_durtgo8	0	*	Its because of the Kurt Vonnegut book Slaughterhouse-Five which is read in a lot of American schools and includes the bombing.
t1_durlq1t	1	*	>  fail to conquer  oh they def conquered it the 2nd time. just couldn't hold it against outside influence 
t1_durtip5	1	*	Burning to death, as in Tokyo, is considered among the worst and most painful ways to die. 
t1_dusakig	0	*	From where do they come? Peopel from Chinese diaspora? Even Tibet-related stuff thrads gets kinda weird
t1_durh8lo	1	*	Unless you have some sources to back your claims up, consider yourself delusional.
t1_durjqon	1	*	Kiiiiinda hard feeling sorry for your country given their actions in the EU and especially considering Germany's incredible work ethic and contribution.
t1_dus3qw8	1	*	On the other side for a while, medical software.
t1_durp4t6	0	*	And Taiwan, and Vietnam is actually pretty cozy with the US, ironically. That's a pretty good chunk of the region.
t1_durit82	0	*	When Koizumi was the prime minister, or whatever he was anyway, he was crying talking about their atrocities. That's not recently.
t1_dut8t96	1	*	Explain to me how I'm wrong.
t1_durfcuq	1	*	Hamburg was a disaster scenario in the original sim city
t1_durpt7q	1	*	... he was neutered ?
t1_durjb7e	1	*	Yea the plan is to have a strong economy and surplus until England, France and Poland invite us to invade them 
t1_durynp8	1	*	That's cool, PG County schools suck. 
t1_dusohze	1	*	On the same note, only 2 of the 8 squad members survive and Private Ryan still lost all 3 of his brothers, and it depicted a war crime when the first German soldier to surrender was killed.
t1_dusam2h	1	*	The assholes that defend the confederacy are mocked by the rest of the US at least. I like the idea of putting a Sherman statues up to replace the confederate ones. 
t1_durbtgx	1	*	Imagine saying this unironically 
t1_durokxr	1	*	Very interesting!  I'll give these a read.  Thank you
t1_dusile0	1	*	Singapor and Macau are too small, and Taiwan is too far out to the sea to be relevant for its size.
t1_dus38q4	1	*	It's not a competition, it's just that the nazi's were also guilty of horrific crimes on that level. 
t1_dur7wmf	0	*	Wasn't the plan for the Russians to take some of the Japanese islands that were mostly unoccupied and close to the Russian mainland.
t1_durfxw8	0	*	Doesn't the whole Dresden had no strategic value idea originally come from Nazi propaganda?  
t1_du79b9t	1	*	So you're saying we should organise our society like media outlets?
t1_du79nr7	1	*	Hikkikomori are those who isolate themselves within their own homes. Choosing to forgo all human contact.   Herbivores are men who are generally not good with women and choose not to pursue them. 
t1_dv38nlm	1	*	I don't have the patience to explain it a third time.
t1_dsf1ety	1	*	So buy a new battery.
t1_dsf3m1t	1	*	so apple increased functionality by 30%. that's exactly what they're going to argue and it's going to win.
t1_dsgkfwg	1	*	Damn, even IKEA just recently dropped the quality of their zipper bags.   That's just low, man ._.
t1_dsercrz	1	*	This is not true, the slowdown is due to how batteries behave when they age - and a new battery resolves it.
t1_dsei0wr	1	*	I don't believe so.  I believe it depends upon battery age and performance.  That is why they are offering people battery replacements.  That's the gist of what I have read too.
t1_dsevmzr	0	*	But you're still paying for electricity used to charge the car, that's the cost of fuel, not like it becomes completely free and you only need to replace the battery eventually.
t1_dsh4k2n	1	*	No, you misunderstand the concept of greed.
t1_dshln0s	1	*	What does this sentence even mean?    Are you agreeing or disagreeing with my point?  Also what specifically about the financial system are you talking about?
t1_dtbgo13	1	*	Neither does the alcohol industry, the police unions, or the private prison industry.
t1_dtauemm	0	*	Victim thinking.  If your government cant take on drug lords you dont have a government.  
t1_dtbfi90	0	*	If the resorts could grow their own weed and provide to guests, people would never buy from the tchotchke shop back room where you get ripped off for 2 grams of shit you wouldn't have smoked in HS.
t1_dtbgs8p	1	*	On the contrary, crime rates would plummet as tax revenues skyrocket
t1_dtauc3y	0	*	I'm calling you naive because clearly you don't know how this mess got started. 
t1_dtbl6fz	0	*	It's legal to grow at home in seven states.
t1_dssbaoq	1	*	Just one more civil war and I think we'll have it. 
t1_dtg7w85	1	*	what plea deal did Clinton take?
t1_dtfov6h	1	*	Maybe it does, but Im talking about direct connections. Calls to action, etc. If your words lead indirectly to violence should you no longer be allowed to speak?
t1_dtgr3vu	1	*	Yea i'm sure there are a lot of better jobs around but i figure the pay ought to be better for the White house equivalent of any toilet cleaner or so.
t1_dtgen6m	1	*	Stupid shithole countrian.
t1_dtgr1mh	0	*	Because to me race has no value, so why would i not exchange it for monetary gain?
t1_dtfs3ie	0	*	This is the funniest thing I've read all day, it's so ridiculous.   And yet essentially we've already passed that low, who was that r denying his own words as they were played back to him? 
t1_dtg9dly	1	*	I spit soup. This was f'n funny.
t1_ds3smfa	1	*	To be fair, you haven't stated any facts so far in this exchange.
t1_dsnrx91	1	*	Meh.
t1_dtp3duo	1	*	It's shaped more like a horseshoe than a straight line spectrum, meaning there are many similarities between socialism and fascism.  That being said, fascism is still a right wing political ideology
t1_duwvhgr	1	*	Its not supposed to be funny. Hes the president of the United States. Its not good policy to belittle our allies or announce his belief in conspiracy theories on a social media platforms. 
t1_ds5aviu	0	*	Everyone is beautiful in the dark!
t1_ds4ykok	0	*	Implying most people can give an intelligent reason for whoever they voted for 
t1_ds4nun3	1	*	What bluff? 
t1_ds4mwml	1	*	Spackle 
t1_ds4on3u	0	*	Yea you're confused because no one is defending North Korea in this comment chain.

t1_dt70t36	1	*	In retrospect, I hardly see a problem with that statement.
t1_dtral5n	0	*	Sounds like the toddler play group leader should be getting a public school teaching job then.... 
t1_dty2dn0	0	*	Which scientists? The same problem presents itself.
t1_dutg16q	0	*	Mostly deer but thanks for the concern.
t1_ds40pyz	0	*	Dude, I collect automatic watches. If its running a second behind, it will be a second behind or more all day.   Youre simply wrong about watches/clocks. Its a good try tho 
t1_du4628m	1	*	So what if they do? I see no problem with that either.
t1_du8ey60	0	*	> violation of your right to bodily integrity  Your right ends the moment your life ends. You have rights; your corpse does not. 
t1_du8jf3t	0	*	June 1967 ended well. 
t1_duy54l6	0	*	I'm gonna let science decide for me. And at the point there is no proof of anything other than decomposing happening to our bodies once we do. 
t1_du8mjbh	1	*	Idgaf about lgbt in black panther. But Dubai could use another parking lot in the asia
t1_du8ggsx	0	*	Why is this even upvoted, when even considering the potential downsides this law is still amazing.

t1_du8p119	1	*	Yeah, bro. Of course lol
t1_du9cyql	0	*	How do you spend your entire life studying one god damn book?
t1_du8tgo9	1	*	There a lot that goes into organ donation.   They dont just rip your bits out and shove them into someone else. 
t1_du8nbj1	1	*	That's a very very very fuzzy line you're drawing 
t1_du8m24u	1	*	Completely agree
t1_du8i33x	1	*	They probably had to add that provision to be able to pass the law. Lawmaking is a messy endeavor 
t1_dua86n4	1	*	The point is the delay before you get priority. Being an organ recipient makes you such a small segment of the population that it doesn't matter where or not you give.
t1_du8m7rt	0	*	And that's not a helpful response.  
t1_du9fqll	0	*	With that logic, why not make it like the draft? /s
t1_du8p3lo	1	*	I would argue with him that there is a large difference between life and meaningful life. Quality of life should be a consideration, not just vital signs.
t1_du9dlx1	1	*	What? How does this have *anything* to do with abortion? I'm genuinely curious how on earth you managed such a leap of logic. 
t1_du8rvoj	0	*	>My Mum refused an autopsy for my Dad when he died suddenly. He was young too (mid 40s).  Bro your mom straight up murdered your dad.
t1_du8iqk4	0	*	You can also sign up to donate your whole body to medical research. My grandparents did, and my parents are registered to. I think I will also. 
t1_du955nv	0	*	I don't give a shit about how legitimate planting flags and drawing borders is. I care about the fact that people were already there.
t1_du8mpgn	0	*	That's so funny, their userbase seems to overlap massively with T_D. Everything democrat or government is a conspiracy, except the Trump-Russia thing, then it's a conspiracy against Trump!
t1_du8ur6p	1	*	That's how the 1% treat everyone else.  
t1_du8j3x3	0	*	And not only that, but the guy is also building stuff on your side of fence...
t1_du8qdvc	1	*	> So a rushed decision when you're at city hall to get your ID is better than thinking taking your time at home?  you have plenty of time to think and can opt-in at any time
t1_du9dgpp	1	*	That article is so hilariously false.
t1_du8kbqq	1	*	Never seen a /s before, I see.
t1_du8ncyu	0	*	Braindead is a very loose term.

t1_du8la0o	1	*	Thats when you need the organ donation duh 
t1_du8qn43	1	*	Still my favorite video of all time.
t1_du9wfr4	1	*	I wasn't talking about the UK but thanks
t1_dua6j27	1	*	I guess people fear what they don't know. Always interesting to hear how things work behind the scenes.
t1_du8lp5k	0	*	I'm not saying that I disagree, but a cadaver is not a citizen.
t1_du8oikf	0	*	It only makes sense if the doctors working on you in the ER know who the organ is going to go to in the transplant hospital. How could they possibly know that?
t1_du8w1hb	1	*	Shame someone let a simple ESL mistake overshadow your anecdote, which is wonderfully darkly humorous.
t1_du8mgz1	1	*	I don't know this reference
t1_du8xugn	0	*	Of course, I wasnt expecting you to.
t1_du8flaa	1	*	Maybe you should get off the fence and make the decision then?    It's not like you have to announce your choice to the world either
t1_du917lg	0	*	Tests fail, people goof.  Basically Human error.     I don't make the rules.  But the people whos careers revolve around this type of work say its not worth it so I'll trust them.  
t1_du8makt	1	*	> who would choose not to donate their organs if given an easy option  If they won't opt-out because it's not easy enough to do so, *then they don't really care about it all that much*.
t1_du9d05w	1	*	So start an awareness campaign to get people to opt in.  The government shouldnt dictate what to take out of peoples bodies, as much good as it may do potentially.
t1_du8rxa6	0	*	I agree, and I don't think the hospital acted maliciously, the point was that the procedure began before it ought to have been and mistakes, however rare, do happen as well.
t1_du8lwkd	1	*	There is more than one organ. You may have bad kidneys but a heart that functions perfectly. Also you can still donate those kidneys for research that will help others to not suffer as you did.
t1_dt3obm1	0	*	No, as everyone knows, it started last Thursday!

t1_dtp9xs1	1	*	Are we the baddies?
t1_dtp2pv0	1	*	Yes that's what I meant. In my country, a layman would only use the acronym NGO to refer to charitable orgs, but legally, there is no distinction between a Red Cross and an IKEA.

t1_dsy7p1h	1	*	We have a minwage, set a maxwage. If you earn over maxwage it is taxed 100% and goes to social services. This has the added benefit of fighting inflation.

t1_dtviyrx	1	*	Hes reaching for something there....  Just missed it by a long shot.
t1_dtvg8v5	1	*	No, not at all. It just seems a bit hypocritical for someone to go, this guy who legally shot this lion is a monster! Now, let's go get some McDonalds, I want a burger!
t1_dtvkqqc	0	*	Well I disagree with that sentiment. 
t1_dtvkj2f	1	*	Can't ^forget ^^Ciaphas ^^^Cain
t1_dtvhg04	0	*	And yet the lion wasn't killed in a western nation.    It was killed in a nation where people eat lion. 
t1_du6pcia	1	*	> There are many cases where a male lion is too old to really produce offspring but is still able to hold on to his pride.    source?

t1_dtvu3n1	1	*	Whooooops
t1_dtvn8d4	0	*	But a lot of species went extinct before we arrived though... if youve ever heard of a fossil before you should know this immediately. 
t1_dtvf5x5	1	*	Killing a lion with hunger in mind, on the other hand, is a fast track to parasites and illness.   So yeah, neither is healthy.
t1_dtvzfql	0	*	Iceland. It was far tastier than I expected! 
t1_dtvpw2h	0	*	I'd disagree with starting with Horus Heresy, honestly. The best starting point is whatever faction you like, in the 40k era; HH is really only for Astartes fans and anyone else will hate it. 
t1_dtvkisy	1	*	> Was anything I said factually wrong?  Pretty much everything you said was factually wrong. You sir, are the one failing. Again, I suggest you educate yourself. 
t1_dtw1u63	1	*	They jump up at you, and disembowel you with their back legs. Youd be dead as fuck in most situations. 
t1_dtvn680	1	*	one is killing an animal for nothing but ego boosting...the other is raising farm animals to feed the human population.
t1_dtvduku	0	*	Your original point was that lions were caged. They're clearly not. 
t1_dtsnhun	0	*	Because theyll continue to grow faster, stronger, smarter, and more innovative while we grow fatter, lazier, dumber, and more useless. Do you think Idiocracys dystopia is something to strive for?
t1_ds3bpa3	0	*	Do you have a rebuttal, or are you going to pull the hitler fallacy, as i expected. 
t1_ds3v1vq	0	*	You are pretty ignorant of reality.

t1_duwazha	1	*	What about 19 years ago? 
t1_duvznsf	0	*	We've heard it has some amazing wildlife. And I do scuba diving but if the coral is a but lacklustre then maybe not. We also kinda want to just chill out and relax.
t1_duv9k3o	0	*	Yes, polar brats love burning plastic. They will follow the scent for miles because they hate being in India so they just want to speed up the process of death. Edit: bears
t1_duv8gcc	1	*	Hey that's because we're gonna colonize it and we're starting the soil invigorating process.
t1_duw3cd9	0	*	Paper doesn't decompose does it? Still disgusting either way.
t1_duw1c1e	0	*	I ordered take out the other day and was pleasantly surprised to receive my soup in a cardboard box that held up great.
t1_duvwo43	1	*	Yes I live in Guatemala and mostly we burn our trash, especially in remote areas. It underscores the importance of competently run infrastructure and a tax system that isn't heinously corrupt IMO.
t1_duw0622	0	*	Cleanly incinerate it in a high temperature  incinerator that can operate hot enough to break down toxic compounds... while generating electricity. Similar to what is used all over Europe and America
t1_duvfy72	0	*	Its still normal, for some people in my neighborhood.  Once at a car wash I saw a woman take a fast food bag out of her car and just stuff it into the bushes.  There was a trash can a few steps away!
t1_duvo35h	0	*	A was surprised to find a paper in my McDonald's bag telling me they are phasing out their foam cups. Not sure why they needed to waste paper to tell let me know, but good on them I guess.

t1_duvj1bi	1	*	It's like what, are they only going to be happy when the whole thing falls apart? [Is this legitimately what they want?](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/235/781/ae6) 
t1_duv5v1k	1	*	Landfills dont smell much better 
t1_duv6yfp	1	*	A lot of railways do that. Also, that happens only on the move, never in stations.
t1_duv8dlb	1	*	At least we had the courtesy to bag it

t1_duwfp88	1	*	> at least that cardboard is just going to break down very quickly. Not nearly as bad as plastic or other oil based containers.  depends upon what the container has been 'lined' with...
t1_duvxr7v	1	*	I don't like litter either but I would recommend not letting trash prevent you from going to some of the coolest places on earth.. But to each their own I suppose
t1_dsj870j	1	*	The Express is a right wing tabloid. They're known for sensationalism and aren't a fan of refugees or immigrants in general.  Basically it's the Mail with less press complaints.
t1_dsmvcl3	0	*	Oh wait, you are referring to what happened in ww2? Jesus, no one gives a shit. Those people are dead, and it wasn't even a government that committed the actions.

t1_du5ri0k	0	*	Or maybe I'm just realizing something that average people don't realize.
t1_dt59ax3	1	*	No jealousy here pal. I work for a Fortune 500 company, and my insurance is paid for, and you are proving that youre just an idiot. 
t1_dsh8hx5	0	*	That's not what he said at all.  Also, I like how you ignore him debunking your more people must mean lower GDP per capita!!!!! argument.
t1_dtj4kfr	1	*	Yes, I know that. What I didn't realize was that when you said the last ten years you actually meant 2009-14. Looks like you were right after all.

t1_duqy32u	1	*	Bro, do you even Latin?

t1_dsjhbv9	0	*	200 explosives small enough to fit on a $300 drone will not take out a whole town or village. You could do a lot more damage with the >$100k this operation would cost.
t1_dsjn0sv	1	*	I didn't come up with the 15,000 figure.
t1_dsjqou3	1	*	I smiled thinking of that.
t1_dsjnwrk	1	*	They could do that... or the could buy a shitty old truck for a few hundred bucks and load it with explosives. The explosives are of course the hard part to get, not the delivery mechanism. 
t1_dsjx8rq	1	*	That is modern warfare in this day and age.

t1_dunqkqh	1	*	Been in the military (sort of, tore my LCL in boot), actually pretty hard to get in. Almost got turned down for a hemorrhoid lol.
t1_dunvmn5	1	*	That's your opinion. He was quite popular before it and Chechen War was very unpopular.
t1_dunylax	0	*	If so many people are already convinced that it is a right, then maybe it should be a protected right. Laws are derived from morals, after all, not the other way around. 
t1_duntwlg	0	*	I very much doubt he has no supporters. But yes the elections are predetermined. Russians have a very different mentality towards politics though.
t1_dunumgs	1	*	To protect the people's liberty from outside threats. They created the government with the ideal that it is a necessary evil, meant to be restricted by the people. Not the other way around.
t1_duomltn	1	*	No he's saying you are a nut who fucks, or a fuck who nuts. I don't know.
t1_duno97m	0	*	Did I say I was against free speech or free press? I'm for it. My point is that we don't have free press. 
t1_dupvebn	0	*	The *supposed to be* was the important part of that statement 
t1_dunts9n	1	*	Like I said, its not simple. When are the drawings no longer enough for these people? I'm all for freedom of expression unless it could lead to hurting other people.

t1_du2pd8m	0	*	well um yeah.  If you don't want to be bound by a contract, you don't sign it.  That's exactly how it works.
t1_dut5pco	0	*	Americans don't like the idea that europe is stronger and bigger when you combine all the countries like states, which it seems like europe is gradually moving toward over time. : )
t1_dusp4hr	1	*	The UN is a joke because of the Security Council. It might still be a joke even without it though because it puts countries like Saudi Arabia on human rights councils. 
t1_du30oll	0	*	After 1948? No, it was Israel by May 1948.
t1_duj5aad	0	*	And yet incredibly true.  
t1_duyoheo	1	*	I'm not sure what you think that would entail, the people responsible have been convicted and the victims' families given a large cash settlement. 
t1_dtlxidc	1	*	You must download the lambo
t1_dtlvf5p	1	*	Exactly, even if it were the case, it would cause it to reset multiple times and causing more wear and tear. Plus, potentially losing the signal.
t1_du4pa6t	1	*	Is that a Canadian talking shit to me about German history? :D
t1_du1ylqr	0	*	And you cant get that in the US?   
t1_dt31a2q	0	*	Well I mean, it is though  That's what happens when you lose a war buddy 
t1_dt2efg4	1	*	Yes, for now.
t1_dt3mtjt	1	*	Have you ever looked at the UN Charter? I am guessing no.  It's powers and functions are [quite limmited](http://www.un.org/en/sc/about/functions.shtml)
t1_dt2v0ur	0	*	Or better, depending on your point of view.
t1_dttpd4h	1	*	> It's like some tightly-held dogma that's resistant to overwhelming evidence and refuses to budge  I'm sure that if I think reeeeeally hard I could think of a parallel.

t1_dttm6v4	1	*	Those aren't conditions, those are freedoms.
t1_dttmrvc	1	*	These are the symptoms of capitalism.

t1_dtu0ifn	1	*	Well TIL!! 
t1_dttdy67	1	*	I'm not saying it's necessary, I'm saying the problems with America's health system dwarf the problems with its jingoism.

t1_dttnfgj	1	*	Made mine with this one ^
t1_dttcyb8	1	*	Sounds similar to a speech trump made
t1_dttfeqf	1	*	It is indeed higher in general, but not remotely close to enough to explain the difference in doctor pay.

t1_dtufhfq	1	*	But profits are never seen as someone's unpaid wages.
t1_dtte9ri	0	*	But, is it a Tide Ad ?
t1_dttd5oh	1	*	Well, the reward is potentially thousands of dollars in medical expenses you're not funding. I still think that's a fool's bet, but regardless, there is a potential reward. 
t1_dtvgwp3	1	*	I am a chemist and an environmental and safety manager. My wife is an administrator in higher ed. We didn't make the point cut-off for needed occupations.

t1_dttjg0a	0	*	That's not exactly true   Normal folks don't go to the mayo clinic 
t1_dtu5r70	0	*	The point being that it is simple to stop being poor.  It isnt nuanced at all. Now I suggest you get off reddit and get to work. 
t1_dttg174	1	*	[Relevant article: When Did America Start Calling its Citizens Consumers](https://people.howstuffworks.com/american-citizens-versus-consumers.htm)  Great article, but also so fucking depressing.

t1_dtth3qe	1	*	Definitely Dickens. Born in Portsmouth, NEW Hampshire.
t1_dtu9y42	1	*	No, i mentioned that healthcare doesn't work as a free market. A tightly controlled market is not a counter-example.

t1_dttzi39	1	*	The opiate thing is bad. Kills so many people. They turn my stomach a mess(luckily?) so I do use cannabis to relieve pain. I find edibles work much better for the pain than inhaling it.

t1_duppywv	1	*	Lol.  None of this will ever happen.  Not saying it shouldn't happen.  But it won't.

t1_dtf9ydu	1	*	On the contrary, public schools here in the UK are actually private schools like Eton, harrow etc. Nearly all our politicians come from these schools.
t1_dte5hct	1	*	The real support he needs is that of the oligarchs that are currently being cut off from their wealth. I expect a coup long before a popular uprising.
t1_dtejrck	1	*	The point is, it would be even worse if he didn't step down.
t1_dtdw4l1	0	*	Sure thats equivalent. Trump has been in power for a year and Putin has been in power for 18, pretty much the same right? Kind of a lazy comparison on your part, I expected better.

t1_dtdtnfn	0	*	How are things with Macri? Haven't kept up with what was going on over there
t1_dtdv80j	0	*	Not having defined positions helped Trump I believe.  It allowed people to imagine or assume that he supported whatever particular agenda they wanted.
t1_dtejoaa	0	*	Well, *to the extent he is fondly remembered* it's largely because he stepped down in time.
t1_dtdxvul	1	*	>stopping it  Publicly funded elections with spending caps are another way to go.  Candidates have to meet some threshold of signatures or something to get the funding, its not a free for all.
t1_dtdx99j	1	*	Whataboutism!
t1_dthgwbc	1	*	Do you have anything concrete to say other than I'm insulted and you're wrong?  You haven't disproven my point.

t1_dsmnuwn	1	*	I 100% agree with you
t1_dsmsp3g	1	*	Yeah, I might support trumps immigration ban if he threw in something to rid us of white trash too. Every time I see a confederate flag from a truck I die a little. 
t1_dtvvq7l	0	*	It's about as covert as North Korea's nuclear program. And economic pressure can do wonders.
t1_duno0vg	1	*	He isn't good enough as a person to qualify for Olympic trials, so he never even sniffed competition. It's because he's lazy.

t1_dt5ci6w	0	*	So the only bar for terrorism is ISIS strapping bombs to kids? The definition can only exist in the most extreme form imaginable?

t1_ds9fan9	0	*	Please don't start with the AIPAC bullshit. AIPAC has very little to no actual influence on foreign policy, but is just the go to excuse for people with little to no understanding of foreign policy.
t1_dsabam3	0	*	A lot of people use Reddit to mean the majority of users in the main subs, not the company that runs the site.  I never even hinted at what people were *allowed* to post, just what gets upvoted.
t1_ds9fzi4	1	*	That distinction doesn't make the slightest difference in this case. Jews in general or Israel in particular, both have been constantly targeted by ridiculous accusations.

t1_dumavpu	1	*	What a cogent and thoughtful response to me proving you to be a liar, and one that is acting to try to prove Goebbels' theory that If you repeat a lie long enough, it becomes truth.
t1_dulqlue	0	*	Well, from my experience not only Sith deal in absolutes, but Americans as well. 
t1_dum2ur7	1	*	No, no, no! It's the below average people that vote in the first place! The truly educated don't vote. :\^)

t1_dumd8oa	1	*	I'm sure if their governments wanted them gone they would be.
t1_dsg6jeb	1	*	Yeah he will. The investigation was expected to take 12+ months so we have some time to go. 
t1_dsgexql	1	*	The aborigines of the American landmass had as much to do with the creation of the United States government and the American country as they did with naming Amerigo Vespucci.
t1_dsghrbn	0	*	By your logic, why not have open borders? Indeed, why exactly should the desire of someone who wasn't born here to be an American count for less?
t1_du28rh4	0	*	I don't know. I was merely giving the person posting some positive encouragement. You sound like an asshole though :) 
t1_du1ggyc	0	*	Less ads, no text posts, not as busy (in regards to the interface), you mostly only see what you follow (as opposed to what others might repost), it's less work to keep up with compared to facebook
t1_du1gjue	1	*	Just downloaded it. I live in Sweden so I dunno how well it'll work here, but so far it seems pretty good!
t1_du1faiw	1	*	Yeah, but the deal breaker for me is the platform, not the corporation. If insta turns into Facebook Ill jump to another one.   
t1_du1f33u	0	*	I did this too, but its been ruined by facebooks obsession with showing me post friends have commented on or liked. So now I constantly see the boring annoying material I catered my profile to avoid.

t1_du1ftya	1	*	Dont know. Just feels more personal to me. 
t1_du1foyi	1	*	I feel like people switched to snapchat and instagram when their parents and relatives started using Facebook. Facebook is less fun when your aunt sally can see every single thing you do on there.

t1_dsgymbv	1	*	Hah. I don't do it to save the world, I do it cause I can make killer coffee on the cheap. Plus, the whole bean, medium roast Tim Hortons beans I buy taste great for a lighter coffee.

t1_dsmdgfo	1	*	Why are you such a pussy about, why would someone care if they're asked if they're Korean or Laotian or Chinese. Just answer the question politely and move on
t1_dsm1zgv	1	*	You can refuse to vote for something you helped write.  Voting and writing are two different actions.  I can't believe this had to be explained.

t1_dsq6qkv	1	*	Ill have your job for this!
t1_dsqefkh	1	*	Hopefully only verbally and she is SO grounded until shes 80.
t1_dsqhrcb	1	*	Yeah when you force someone to pray their gay away you make them want to kill themselves instead of having to get your own hands dirty. 
t1_dsq7pql	1	*	>Right now more people are having sexual relations than at any point in human history  dam, guess I'm a failure.
t1_dsqp4b8	0	*	It is smaller than texas.

t1_dsq87hf	0	*	Believe it or not but some people actually like wearing burqas through their own choice.
t1_dsqiuje	0	*	I think we're less racist now than we were. The issue is that the internet allows the small minority a much larger voice than would otherwise be possible.
t1_dst3l0p	0	*	In this comment thread, we were talking about Linda Sarsour's support for Shariah law. What are *you* talking about?
t1_dsqa7xm	1	*	That describes most of the male Asian population. We live in dangerous times.

t1_dsq5hdj	0	*	Literally proving his point.
t1_dsrkhte	0	*	I mean, great, but it was his main talking point. You can say it was a non-issue to you but look at actual general sentiment; people are pissed.
t1_dsq5lbr	1	*	I can literally here you're so fucking dead.
t1_dsqbf0h	0	*	> You imply the Prime Minister was lying  Do i though ? did you read my two previous statement ? I never called him a liar

t1_dsqcf3v	0	*	Same in Canada.
t1_dsq1yan	1	*	Speak for yourself. I'm already terrified to talk to women. 
t1_dsq4t3v	1	*	You think Moderates and democrats in the US believe there's more complaining about racism than actual racism?   Ha! 
t1_dsq5xb3	0	*	It's not necessary, but it makes it easier. Smashing an onion is easier than cutting it as long as you've no intention of sifting through the remains for the edible bits.
t1_dsqt3lq	1	*	People not reading is a big problem here.  A deleted comment earlier was calling *me* an idiot for pointing out these were pro Trump hoaxes

t1_dsqyj6x	1	*	Jizz? Yeah!
t1_dsqisyt	1	*	Sure, but that also doesn't require treating their word as gospel - especially if you aren't an investigator and instead are a media/news organisation.
t1_dsqqix7	1	*	Surely you jest, lol
t1_dsq983a	0	*	No, why would you assume that?
t1_dsr59e2	1	*	Yep :(
t1_dsqc44y	1	*	Thats alright. Ill just take solace in the fact that you couldnt provide any examples and spelled literally wrong.
t1_dsqbwu4	1	*	That's a weird takeaway. I'm talking about producing more TV and you think white nationalism?
t1_dsq75sd	1	*	If you look at the video at :35 in retelling her story she says  I told my brother... but then corrects herself 
t1_dsqhkz9	0	*	When someone is downvoted for asking for sources you just know people are making shit up. 
t1_dsqdqk1	1	*	So you were raped by a feminist, were suspended because you followed a teacher's directions and you are bernie supporter and you lie lie lie lie lie
t1_dsq1u13	1	*	In this case she wasn't accusing a certain man in particular. Her parents were hardliner anti-refugee activists that tried to coach their daughter to use as a prop in their campaign.
t1_dsqb8wf	0	*	My roommate in college was great.  Didn't shoot at me, steal my food or try to kill any of my friends.  Good dude, going to his wedding in Jordan this summer. 
t1_dsq4f0l	1	*	I explicitly referred to 'Canadians', not just Trudeau
t1_dsq4xc2	1	*	Die, you bastard
t1_dsq41br	0	*	Or theyre so far past it that what theyre doing isnt viewed as a race issue to them. 
t1_dsqrazf	1	*	They raided the house because they were terrorists who had no business being in that country in the first place, they were from Egypt.
t1_dsq480h	1	*	That's a different line of criticism than saying he 'knew this was a lie'.
t1_dt3382b	0	*	That's still a significant majority.  But the larger US ratio explains the initial mental picture of a female nurse, assuming that commenter was from the US.
t1_dtzsunk	0	*	I see your point, but to believe its not happening is what they want.
t1_ds50pje	1	*	*Tips top hat*

t1_ds66fis	1	*	>So the politicians in power are nt extremist.  FTFY
t1_ds6ifqm	0	*	Why? Is it not convincing someone? I'm not even American or an American apologist. You're barking at the wrong tree.
t1_dszdpph	1	*	No, dude. If you wouldn't quit your job this very day to uphold your principles, you're ~~not swimming in opportunities~~ a disgrace.
t1_dt14xd8	1	*	He hasnt done much good since he got into office, and he has three more years to mess it up. If hes lucky, and we are not.

t1_dso8jm0	0	*	I think he was saying that if they weren't shit holes they wouldn't need the aid
t1_dsnt6r9	0	*	Right because chicks get so turned on by racism.  You know when youre losing an argument when you change the subject by calling someone a virgin or lib. 
t1_dso8cj9	0	*	Trump is an idiot. But the 9th is fucking retarded for believing immigration doesn't fall under his powers, because it does. And if you agree with the 9th, then you're uneducated about the issue.
t1_dsomtcq	0	*	Looks you have a reading comprehension issue
t1_dtw7613	0	*	The Palestinian Authority disagrees with you.

t1_dt1ocfk	1	*	Or, alternatively, live free.
t1_dt1d82v	0	*	I'm talking about one family dynasty. Rome and Egypt had multiple dynasties. If I use your false equivalencies, China would have lasted for 5000 years.

t1_dt1pthy	0	*	No thanks, I don't want a Reagan tax increase.
t1_dt1egcb	0	*	Wait, the majority of the population is against Net Neutrality?  Is that why they literally faked all the talk about Net Neutrality? Used dead peoples aliases?
t1_dt1il49	1	*	my shit is being shutdown tomorrow unless something changes.

t1_dt1gfxm	0	*	Ah, the advantages of base housing.  Then you don't have to worry about making rent or utilities and can walk to work.
t1_dt1n5rj	0	*	It's one thing to kill people during war, that's an inevitability.  It's another to murder millions of your own people through incompetence and reform.

t1_dt1gzpq	1	*	Trump at least stands for you
t1_dt1mgjh	0	*	I believe  navy fed will still pay you an estimated check off base pay. I know my brother has said something like that, he is active coast guard and uses them 
t1_dt1e34n	0	*	I'm mostly joking. I just don't like to call countries socialist whose workers don't own the means of production because I'm pedantic. I myself am a social democrat.
t1_dt1coz9	1	*	You can go about your business... move along, move along. 
t1_dt5o5n0	0	*	They crush thousands of people with tanks, and to this day they ban any mention of it. Yea I guess Im not going to just let that go.
t1_dt1els4	1	*	> golly that feels good *disappears*  Ftfy
t1_e0gytp8	1	*	I think it's a fantastic idea, that only anti-social loafers and low-level psychopaths would object to.
t1_dt1ceq5	0	*	It's a comment aimed at a person happy about a situation that clearly affects thousands of people in a negative way. 
t1_dt1g7i1	1	*	Tax breaks? And hypothetically tax money from companies moving back due to automation.
t1_dt1cyw3	1	*	From both sides? Oh fuck, this is politics what did I expect.
t1_dt1ckfo	1	*	You must not know much about the time period to assume that was my implication.  The new culture movement and the PRC came about as a direct result of European Imperialism and Japanese bellicosity. 
t1_dt1ho1l	0	*	China's economy has been built on cheap labor, but so was ours at a time. They are evolving, and there is no sign their economy is slowing down.

t1_dt1el2o	1	*	But we make the big bucks, right?  Im on internal programs and still got the temp boot.  I'm looking for a new job right now.

t1_dt1m01m	0	*	Mao rose up through a completely different process. If we're discussing the current process, I'd say that the Chinese HOS will be competent. 
t1_dt1d9m4	0	*	Prease, no, I have famiri, here, take this, my Shcity beef, you like it? Prease dont take me away
t1_dt1mhcr	1	*	Shutting the government down always costs money. Any change of regular business ends up costing money.  Given Mulvaney's chronic incompetence, I'm sure this will somehow cost more than normal.
t1_dt19b49	1	*	No, but they do have a singing general.  
t1_dt1i7dc	0	*	Do you think they even need to be paid? I'm sure they'll just as easily fuck everyone over for free... 
t1_dt2oigv	1	*	I understand the idea, and it would be sound if consensus was possible. It becomes terrible when politics are so polarized than agreeing with the other side is instinctively seen as bad.
t1_dt1wdj9	0	*	You had slaves. Is there a convenient limit on how far back in time we're allowed to go?
t1_dt1pjsj	1	*	100,000 now. LOL
t1_dt22ag8	1	*	And don't criticize the ruling party. Being free is really simple!
t1_dt1dkbj	1	*	Same for military. We still come in for work, but no guarantee of backpay
t1_dt1cde5	1	*	term limits have there merits, that way you don't end up with a Robert Mugabe.
t1_dt19e71	0	*	Because they have broad enough platforms that any third party that grows large enough simply causes one of the parties to shift their platform to absorb that party.   
t1_dt1ntq2	0	*	I know what communism was in theory. I'm talking about in practice.
t1_dt9lwu4	1	*	Otherwise a pretty decent ruler, by most standards. Ruthlessly crushing active opponents of state was par the course

t1_dt1tjnn	1	*	Wow that's awesome, because I also think that too. That's kind of why I never challeged that point.
t1_dt1fz0f	0	*	I mean there was an actor as precedent so this always works, right?
t1_dt1lgv9	1	*	All modern countries all the same, they are modern.
t1_dt1cllb	1	*	No, its a parliamentary monarchy.  Every Act that passes through parliament requires Royal Assent before it becomes law.  The Queen has absolute power.  She chooses not to use it.
t1_dt1ctmm	1	*	Yes, yes it does. Currently owe our great nation $1000 from being overpaid when they didn't pay us for 4 months 
t1_dt1cjvp	1	*	Australia has changed voting systems a few times for various reasons. We used to use the same system as what the US uses, before we decided that was a terrible idea and moved to a preferential system.
t1_dt1nw42	1	*	No need to equivocate the actions by the US government with those of the Chinese government.  They really are not comparable.

t1_dt1hsxr	0	*	I live in Guangzhou. In my two years of living here, haven't seen one picture of Mao except on the money or at historical sites. 
t1_dt19vrc	1	*	Hey, Trump wasn't democratically elected either. No other democratic country has a stupid electoral college like that. The most popular always wins, because we're the ones with *real democracy*.
t1_dt1d2nk	0	*	These violent delights have violent ends.

t1_dv3uml8	1	*	Don't worry, you can still vote for EU parliament. Every vote counts there  Wait ...
t1_dv3r1v5	1	*	Also a problem with the education system if their population so lacks basic critical thinking and analysis skills that Twitter bots and Facebook would affect their vote so severely.

t1_dsye8ow	1	*	He sure lives up to his name with him dancing too close to the fire of self-destructive altruism
t1_dsydwpg	0	*	The rabbis will not consider them Jewish but they still have a right to citizenship if any 1 of their grandparents is Jewish.
t1_dsyswtb	1	*	Who says it's unwinnable? Do you know the specifics & conditions of the conflict there? Savage is quite a negative label for someone simply engaging in a discussion. Or attempting to that is
t1_dsy5m19	1	*	Theyre not being deported because of race or anything. They are asylum seekers that are being denied in April. 
t1_dsyhulo	1	*	This is not unusual, most countries do this. From what Ive read China is spending hundreds of millions on their soft power attraction.
t1_dsy7xfk	0	*	This is being done legally according to international laws on asylum.
t1_dtps3qz	1	*	Killing those damn axolotls, of course!
t1_ds4ohp9	1	*	Yeah I could have done without that part too, I just choose to listen what he was actually trying to get across. He let his message get emotional, and he got emotional responses back.

t1_duhbot8	1	*	 No, because they're openly biased. Give me politifact and factcheck.org all day. Just not snopes.
t1_duh1yj4	1	*	I agree. But when you're deer hunting, sometimes you only know there's a deer around when you hear it snap a branch on accident.

t1_duhcdbu	1	*	Mueller...mueller...mueller.  That was easy
t1_duh6i2y	0	*	Do you think Donald Trump colluded with the Russian government to affect the 2016 election - yes or no?
t1_duhft0n	1	*	You really said bitch though?
t1_duj2jz6	1	*	Speculating, not projecting, I think. It is speculation, to an extent, in that we don't know what he could have been charged with and what sort of sentencing he might have faced to those charges. 
t1_duh1ll9	0	*	This just makes me so happy
t1_duh92p5	1	*	At this point yes they would. They have power now and will for about another year, and then itll be gone in the November elections. They are circling wagons at all costs
t1_duh7d0p	1	*	Agreed 100%. I've been wondering the same thing. 
t1_duh3tfc	1	*	Then hopefully impeachment

t1_du0owpb	0	*	Why should Trump declassify this memo when Democrats claimed declassifying this kind of stuff was dangerous to national security? That's what the said about the Nunes memo?
t1_durayvl	1	*	Its....not perfect, but then we havent had secret police visiting us either.  And yeah, that did happen after my dad defected.
t1_duqltp2	1	*	It really breaks down very simply: You advocate for understanding other perspectives without taking any position or action. Frankly, that's an impotent and useless way of living.
t1_durn566	0	*	I'm arguing that the 19th century colonialists *were* the bad guys.  And the current bad guy in this discussion is the censoring authoritarian regime that rules China.

t1_dt00cp0	1	*	Your over-the-top usage of exclamations made it plenty obvious, I think. 
t1_dt032o3	1	*	I didn't say this particular guy did it. I was just saying why would you  a billionaire kill himself? isn't a valid reason to rule out murder-suicide. 
t1_dszxrlq	0	*	Going through the wiki, I don't think they even knew what poisoned him until after his death when investigators found a 'hot' teapot.

t1_dsal718	0	*	Check again, I doubt it says its from cane unless its the expensive stuff.  Its more likely it wont say where its from at all, like I said, nearly all our sugar in the UK is from sugar beet.
t1_dul5mvv	0	*	I know the Poles were attacked as well, and I don't mean to downplay the Polish losses or suffering, but my question remains: why limit what people can say? 
t1_duvjnkx	1	*	Remember, when you don't have a counter argument or lack knowledge, just insult the person, it shows how intelligent you are.
t1_duti4i8	0	*	Well. Let's replace the word kill by eating a pizza. I am sure you will see the point. Now, did Putin get to eat the pizza, or the other guy?
t1_duw8g3t	0	*	Ok, TIL any pro-western crook at power in Russia is hero for west.

t1_dt7u22s	1	*	I'm sick of taking the high road and losing.
t1_dt82o33	0	*	I'm not American so I'm kind of confused here ... Why do you call it spicy mustard? Is there mustard that's not spicy? Or does that simply mean extra spicy mustard?
t1_dt9w1nr	0	*	Apperantly u/Minscota does. Just by audio he can tell who in the audience boo'd, and who clapped.
t1_dtaqizp	0	*	Obama didn't go to Davos to cry about being mistreated by media or played an idiot WHY DOES THIS HAPPEN TO ME, WON'T SOMEONE TELL ME.
t1_dt9wes1	1	*	Exactly, and it's likely just members of the president's staff clapping cause I only hear a couple of people clapping.
t1_dtad2mg	1	*	Freedom of the press doesnt say the president can't criticize the news 
t1_du6m3pa	1	*	Cool! Thanks for clarifying. 
t1_dthmes3	1	*	I am the dissident, the groupthink crowd has been brainwashed into hating Russia, remember?
t1_dt8dfjp	0	*	Are you single?
t1_dt8rrsv	1	*	For sure.   For context, the tones mine has are like, cellphone text alert on max volume. Nothing powerful, just enough to grab their ear.
t1_dt8czds	0	*	Any idea how you turned out like that? Some experience from childhood, or one day you just found out that pain is nice?
t1_dtyy9dm	0	*	You could just try lying in court, I hear that's not allowed. 
t1_dtz7kvo	0	*	You know the difference being one is a people with religion in common, the other having a common goal among them of eradicating anyone who isn't white. Pretty big difference.
t1_dtzmmli	1	*	Did you read the comment I was responding to?   Also propagating hate sounds like arresting people for free speech. Hate speech is protected in the USA under free speech 
t1_du06bd9	0	*	There was a protest full of them and it was one panicked guy who didn't press the brakes. Why didn't all of them just maim and kill?
t1_dtz9zr6	1	*	If he's the only Nazi I don't see whats wrong with the site if no one else was reading it.   Naziphobia is rampant these days smdh.
t1_du1ez8i	0	*	Why? Why can't they just use guns like last time? They already want to expel all black people, which isn't allowed by the constitution. What makes ending speech rights any different?
t1_dtzegsr	0	*	There is evidence to believe the japanese army may have resorted to cannibalism when they were invading Manchuria and china.
t1_duwvh8f	0	*	What did I do wrong exactly?  You're trying to dehumanize trans* people and i'm calling you out on that.

t1_dtwo6i0	0	*	See there are some nuances here that I think dont particularly make it safe to call him a dictator, let alone a despot. He is an autocrat and is a totalitarian. 
t1_dtwkje5	0	*	I never said anyone was guilty of anything. 
t1_dtwmfic	0	*	*cue
t1_dtwo0jc	0	*	A dictator has absolutely power. A totalitarian relies on other institutions to be aligned with their power while allowing a small form of dissent.  
t1_dtwluki	1	*	Good game guys this was productive and helpful 
t1_dtwo6s7	1	*	Wouldn't being like Donald Trump be good? Like, successful and knowledgeable and completely revitalized the party he joined.
t1_dtwmne6	1	*	You don't think he's tried to? Moron.
t1_dtwtoah	1	*	God, kind of like Jair in Brazil then. What the fuck is with these guys!

t1_dtwvq5p	0	*	That seems... okay? Better than the other two candidates from what I've seen so far.
t1_dtxf3ed	1	*	I find it hard to see it happen, but I feel like the pieces will somehow fall in to place for it to happen.  I guess we just wait and see.
t1_dtwsvut	1	*	yyyyyep.   G-d bless the Tamimis and all others fighting against the occupation. They're made of far stronger stuff than I.
t1_dtwrw7o	1	*	Reminds me painly about The shape of water... 
t1_dtwnq6i	1	*	Yeah, I don't think they picked up on the fact that Syria is a war zone and that choosing to move there as a better alternative is indicative of hyperbole.
t1_dtwrrso	1	*	In the fairly certain stance that there is a better future somewhere don the Road 
t1_dtwnvqe	1	*	No one supports Trump so much as they just hate America.
t1_dtws0rw	1	*	See: currently leeching off American tax dollars,  Also currently living off land they stole.
t1_dtx2lxu	0	*	How is it biased?
t1_dtwmpql	1	*	He wants to be one, matter to be seen if he's allowed to be
t1_due3bix	0	*	Oky then I would wait for evidence before I make my mind up.

t1_dsr2gw4	0	*	> I don't see any comments  lol, my bad, didn't notice you corrected your own bullshit statement.
t1_dsqaomk	0	*	That sucks. In those situations if adult gets charged, teen should also get charged as complicit to crime, because he/she did it willingly & using deceit.
t1_dv2259l	0	*	You are making a positive scientific claim. Have a source for that?
t1_dstqx78	0	*	Hold on, what? I'm pretty sure not saying no doesn't imply consent. 
t1_dstswep	1	*	Oh true. 
t1_dszqa3b	1	*	> Its almost like you took my words to mean what you wanted them to mean  He is spot on, Bernie lost get over it.
t1_dsfs8rj	0	*	Already warming yes, but how much methane reaches the atmosphere? A lot of it oxidises, but i would still look at the places i linked. They talk about this stuff a lot better then me.
t1_dtj6su5	0	*	hahaha oh this is great
t1_ds3ch9r	1	*	Thanks! :) 
t1_dsgur08	1	*	Except that this is more like what the body learns from a Rabies infection.  Which is one thing.  Long term death!
t1_dsgj49i	0	*	pee, poo, then spit.
t1_dsgt07o	1	*	LOL I don't support overregulation. I support good regulation. I DON'T support extremists like foolish libertarians and communists who don't know anything about the real world.
t1_dsgigk4	0	*	No mine. I reread my comment and thought that I had phrased that very poorly.
t1_dsggkyi	1	*	I don't think you understand. I said that ISP's are NOT utilities so they are under-regulated, and that they are unregulated because they're in bed with politicians. 
t1_dsgp2id	1	*	This is an idiotic way of looking on it on, I think, exactly three levels. I'll let you decide what those three are.
t1_dsgdptd	0	*	The winning move is to have a decentralized economy in which the workers own and operate companies.
t1_dsglqva	1	*	Lol

t1_dsgpba6	1	*	Materials science would like to have a word with you but it's still figuring out how to meet the specs of the engineering problem.
t1_dsgq421	1	*	So this is one thing that Obama initiated that he'll take credit for.  It's bigly for the economy. It's, you know, super smart.
t1_dsghkuq	0	*	They forget that at that time, it was the *rich* white men who had that power. Poor whites (i.e., non landowners) were considered garbage as well.
t1_dsgk70c	0	*	What are you going to do about it?
t1_dsgtw9h	0	*	Err if you think that is only the right, then you seriously lack the capacity to be objective. 
t1_dsgmdtl	1	*	I went and voted third party, knowing that it was essentially a worthless vote (especially in Kentucky where I live), but I did it anyway specifically so I couldn't have people say I didn't vote lol
t1_dsggvr0	1	*	Look on the bright side, people may not be immortal, but with estate tax cuts, their money can be!

t1_dsgkd5b	0	*	How is extending something vs creating something not different?
t1_dsgdl93	0	*	For example, is man made climate change real? What is the Bowling Green massacre? Who had a larger inauguration crowd, Trump or Obama?   
t1_dsguvt2	1	*	So... Bill Nye?
t1_dsgpg0h	0	*	All negative things. He really failed the American people. 
t1_dsgveqn	0	*	How are your rolls doing? 
t1_dsgptuh	1	*	Probably stoners that have exceptional balance.
t1_dshfx0p	1	*	I thought of that a few weeks ago and yes its disgusting. I hope this fucker gets impeached so he isnt honored at all when he eventually dies. 
t1_dsgk9wk	1	*	Well land ownership, so almost capitalism in its entirely. The creator was a georgist.

t1_dsgkjyg	1	*	!WHO TOUCHED MY ~~SPAGHET~~ EMAILS!
t1_dshh3zo	1	*	You Pass Go..... you get our country
t1_dsgg2id	1	*	It's a joke. Trump won't release his taxes because he claims the IRS is auditing him so he can't. IRS put out a statement saying you can still release your taxes under audit. 
t1_dsgj8kl	1	*	You rub one out like a man. It's the champagne of victory.
t1_dsgh015	1	*	Doesn't happen. They insta ban anybody who challenges their view

t1_dsf52um	1	*	Done more than Obama? He signed a tax bill. What else has he done?
t1_dse9b8n	0	*	Ah, forgive me I completely misinterpreted your original comment.
t1_dsejgit	1	*	As a fellow vet, you need to look to your original oath. Protecting the POTUS isn't part of it. If you were an officer, even listening to the POTUS isn't part of it.
t1_dulde9m	0	*	I'm not, I'm just showing that the Palestinian gov't isn't interested in rights, they just want their own place where they can continue to deny rights to their people.
t1_dulc9ff	0	*	Or just not running as many hydro generators.  Why use solar and wind to pump water up a hill when you could just use it to supply the load at the time and run the hydro generators less?

t1_dsufkkp	1	*	Why would we be? Consider a given alien world with life. Let's say Planet Whamsprockers. Are they not aliens to us, no matter where in the universe they happen to visit?

t1_dswam7k	0	*	They obviously weren't. You can tell because of how many people took issue with it.
t1_dsw2vsm	0	*	I believe the athletes will still have to pass individual dope tests as well, so if they are doping on something that can be detected, they still won't compete, even as an individual.

t1_dt34obv	0	*	Tibet was a religious serfdom when it had more autonomy.   China is actually bringing infrastructure improvements to Tibet, just at the expense of Tibetan culture.
t1_dt3q641	0	*	Or maybe he's just mature enough to realize that not being perfect is not the same as literally Hitler.  But you know, whatever works for you bud.

t1_dt2f11y	1	*	hence war.

t1_du6ag0s	1	*	Apple seems to indicate that point is at 0,00015%
t1_duoayw0	0	*	They do, but since when has Japan or China cared about that.  Japan kills hundreds of whales every year in the name of science but some how all the meat still ends up on the market.
t1_duo98s0	1	*	In a place that likely don't care about regulations hence the dilemma.
t1_dupetzt	0	*	Eating any sort of animal protein can be ultimately drawn up as an environmental problem.  Tuna farming is a booming industry.

t1_du333e2	1	*	I remember reading an article where one of them explained it.  I am not sure what the details are to explain why.
t1_dtfze1w	1	*	Good point. All the tribes had a lot of similarities in their culture, maybe not as different as in Britain after the Norman invasion because it created a big change in culture within England.

t1_dtdesi5	1	*	That's probably his biggest input as an opposition leader, as his political and personal views are nothing to brag about.
t1_dtdqisf	1	*	Huh, thought it was 5, either way its an issue that should be fixed.

t1_dtv75wt	1	*	Calm down there Treebeard.
t1_dspktih	1	*	Mate, every bit of US military and other aid has the same condition -- in fact, it's more accurate to call it Halliburton, General Dynamics, Raytheon, etc. Gift Cards than money.
t1_dtr3v5w	1	*	Lets see, the ghost ships washing up on shore in japan with dead North Koreans in them and worm ridden soldiers running to South Korea might be a good indication the people arent far from revolting. 
t1_dsaa2x7	1	*	> you don't have to be a merciless consumer at others expense.   I honestly can't tell if you're talking about China or America here.

t1_dsugq80	1	*	That's hilarious for 2 reasons: 1. Of the top 5 longest sniper kills in history, 3 were made by Canadians. 2. Sorry eh!
t1_dstr68w	0	*	Idk actually, that CNN article makes it seem like Moon really meant it. Granted, Moon isn't totally in favor of Trump's approach. He says it could bring about unintentional clashes.

t1_dsu6j0b	1	*	Yeah, sadly it got 12 upvotes from people who didnt read the article apparently 
t1_dstrg02	1	*	So you dont have a citation to anything that Trump actually did then, only that South Korea gave him credit while not having done anything.
t1_dstovd6	1	*	Why is Korean women's hockey so important?  This is the skill level of middle school boys.  It doesn't matter at all.  If there is even a slight chance it helps in a tiny way it is worth doing this.

t1_dsttbso	0	*	Who are they?     My god Americans are easily brainwashed.     Moon was grinning and the reporters were laughing when he said that. 
t1_dsucz84	1	*	Something can only crash so much before it becomes too volatile to seriously invest in.
t1_dstokg6	1	*	OK, now you are fighting a guerilla campaign 10 times bigger than the one in Vietnam.  Most of North Korea is mountainous forests meaning no vehicles or helicopters. 
t1_dstphzx	1	*	how do you know? Are you basing this off just what he posts on twitter?

t1_du02rrx	1	*	Citation needed. The examples I found of oil companies being sued were related to their use of wind farms that didn't do enough to protect birds. This runs counter to both your claims.

t1_du9dxu4	1	*	Tanzania's currency is not very stable and its government is a touch more corrupt than the other countries I mentioned. Not really a huge deal in the long run though.
t1_du9vbhk	1	*	There are some who aren't pulling their weight, but many who are saving. Last I checked, water usage was at about 520 million litres a day. 
t1_du9ftyx	1	*	LEAVE BERNIE ALONE :'
t1_du9dcrg	1	*	You're talking about the Dow Jones falling. That has absolutely nothing to do with the economy, and is more representative of the state of companies related to the index.

t1_du9cg9m	0	*	Yeah, I've never been, but you get this idea of like Jungle Warlords and everyone has an AK
t1_du9zuxe	1	*	Can anyone even remember an instance when the UN stepped in and solved anything? The only examples I can think of were decades ago. Now its just a platform for countries to bicker with each other.

t1_duwne6f	1	*	The issue is not tax incentives but special tax incentives applying just to Apple. Several other big companies complained about Apple's special deal.

t1_dsznx42	1	*	It's not very hard. It's just a matter of how smart the hacker is. 
t1_duxsmr9	0	*	Yea they use SPLC as their source.  So ima gonna say bullshit. 
t1_duxuyf6	0	*	Oh right.  The old, everything I dont agree with is toxic and everyone I dont agree with is a bot bullshit.  Go over to r/politics if you need a safe space.
t1_dsuzcaq	1	*	Yep, it turned out that the integration of second-generation immigrants did not go as expected. With citizenship and social rights they did not need to work as their parents did, 
t1_du6rmy7	0	*	>Person with post history getting mad about the modern name of the city of Istanbul and calling the ANC terrorists.  You sound like someone with fascinating opinions dude.

t1_ds9kyt0	1	*	My shit's pretty locked down but I'm getting a cheap crappy smartphone for going out of the country. Great explanation and info.

t1_ds9r4gu	0	*	Though I traveled to UK only once ( about a year ago ) the experience with the customs was rather pleasant.
t1_ds9jbu7	0	*	No, it really doesnt. The use of ad hominem arguments really takes away from your statement.
t1_ds9m2mj	0	*	What if I happen to be a black person? Would an aboriginal person, or one of the many other non-white Australian people, not be welcome and should expect to be tasered to death?

t1_ds9v0tw	1	*	Um, no not in the EU they don't. I've never been asked for passwords, account access or any of this bullshit. We still have stupid laws that I don't agree with but the US is way more extreme. 
t1_ds9ui1u	1	*	Because people think they know everything from afar.
t1_ds9o8rn	1	*	I know it sounds like a silly question, I suppose I should have rephrased it.

t1_dscjjog	0	*	No.
t1_ds9rxd5	1	*	This is great, if you ever make it, I'd be thrilled to try it out.  I don't think there's another app that lets you enter a different pin on the lockscreen and changes what shows up on your phone
t1_ds9mjf7	1	*	Gonna save this comment so I can keep track of you! Good luck and happy coding
t1_ds9kjcf	1	*	Thats honestly a brilliant idea.
t1_dsdmoj1	1	*	No, but I did use that when I flashed RR. This was a feature where you would put in a different passcode into the normal lock screen and it would seamlessly (sort of) switch accounts. 
t1_dsa8ftp	1	*	If you lie you've broken the law, and if you tell the truth you admit to having broken a law. Everyone's a criminal!

t1_ds9kh8x	1	*	Right! I think its the best thing to do to avoid any headache about CBP prying into your digital devices.
t1_dsajao3	0	*	Just tell them you don't use social media.  What are they going to do?  Try to cross-reference you with everyone with the same name on FB?
t1_ds9rhoy	1	*	Im traveling.....get the dick phone.  
t1_ds9n9rh	1	*	There's gotta be an app for that. If not, I got dicks. I mean dibs. 
t1_ds9j9cc	0	*	alright you have convinced me. You clearly know everything about this topic.

t1_ds9tiug	0	*	That's been a thing for years I had such an app on Android 2
t1_ds9r2jh	0	*	That won't stop the border guys from inserting some spooky malware into your device.
t1_ds9lxxs	1	*	That's fucked up. You should be allowed to see and even film what they're doing. What if they place something illegal in it and bust you, or put a tracker or something in it? 
t1_ds9pzps	0	*	Threatening your family over your actions is what the Communist and fascists did. And what NK still does.
t1_ds9kwox	1	*	Makemallof America Great Again!
t1_du4gcwc	0	*	Yes? Why would you by bread with bitcoin?     
t1_du4uufs	0	*	The effects spanned generations. Some say that to this very day, there are many Americans who cannot locate Canada on a map.
t1_du6engj	1	*	Not really. The internet, products and services get their value from the resources required. Bitcoin gets it value from it's users.
t1_du3uizr	0	*	You asked Why does Reddit bitch and whine so much about bitcoin? Not why does Reddit bitch about Bitcoin in Iceland, to a guy who also didn't mention Iceland and was talking about Bitcoin in general. 
t1_duez7l8	1	*	Still with childish insults, totally meaningless. Can you answer my question, why is that so hard to answer, its just your personal opinion. and I'm actually curious what you think.
t1_dun4q25	1	*	Heard the term exclusively in the military while in a USN fighter squadron (VF-51), a bandit being a confirmed enemy/ hostile aircraft

t1_dun2xq8	0	*	Context my friend. Context. Just saying they stopped BLM therefore it wasn't meant to help Trump is a jump in conclusion. They made pro-blm memes to dissuade going to the polls and voting for Hillary.
t1_dun1rj7	1	*	Putin has a well-known grudge against her.
t1_dundpjx	1	*	I don't really agree, either. Intellectuals are maybe more deceptive, but they are great at twisting facts. 
t1_dunnjf1	0	*	I do have a South Park tattoo, and no you cant see it, its for the ladies eyes only. 
t1_dundd8x	0	*	Glad you have all the answers. People are complex. Its not as simple as what you are reducing it to. 
t1_dun8qjq	1	*	good one, i suggested Ghasts, because the Undead often work in service of a necromancer.
t1_dun5qqg	0	*	It still directly contradicts the Russia narrative,  Which was subatantiated based on IP addresses...  Also there are people involved who have come out & said this is the case
t1_dundrjw	0	*	Raises, maybe?    (I'm sensing my approach to English is getting closer to code debugging every day.)
t1_dun120m	0	*	whoa, where did i say i think the reds are corrupt? where did i say that the blues are not corrupt? i simply asked for further explanation, which i got.  take a lap
t1_dun2adc	0	*	I am glad somebody propped up by the establishment didn't win because she should have despite not representing the will of the people. 
t1_dun4met	1	*	*aggressively updoots*
t1_dunjply	1	*	You might want to go back and read the comment you responded to, then. The first item in their list was anti-Trump.
t1_dunkog3	0	*	In Russia I meant. 
t1_dunbmlf	1	*	you just got bamboozled by Maskirovka
t1_dun0eal	1	*	She was by far the candidate with the strongest stance on Russia 
t1_dud5qbv	1	*	Your inability to pronounce something does not make it bad for you, although your overall point isn't unfair
t1_ducqquh	0	*	What?  I drink 3 or 4 rockstars a day, I'm just pointing out how hilariously hypocritical he was being.
t1_dudyj2v	1	*	Enough milk/cream to make it light and enough sugar to make it sweet. 
t1_ducram1	1	*	Maybe you can't handle a construction job if you can't handle a cup of coffee, seeing as you'll get da beetus. 
t1_ducvsc1	0	*	IMO Diet Coke is much nicer. Normal Coke is too sweet. But this is British coke - I don't know how much variation there is.
t1_dudxdul	1	*	A burger would last you longer satiation wise though, better to eat shitty food than shitty drinks imo

t1_dscoz1c	1	*	I had a very inexperienced professor once, I learned to teach myself that semester. It was pretty neat.
t1_dsc6gos	0	*	Lol, you realise your UNESCO source doesn't even support your point right? You're making a huge jump by thinking low literacy rates mean only fucking rich people went to university.
t1_dsp5tnv	0	*	No shit.  I'm asking you for backup for the claims you made.  You know like the audio or the news article.  That'd be a starting point.
t1_dsne2di	1	*	That teachers have to personally buy essential supplies for teaching is a failure on the public school system on its own. 
t1_dsnyvee	0	*	Is that really the saying in full? but don't rule out malice?
t1_dsmtlhu	1	*	My notions are just fine, just the habitual mob mentality and wondering how did the world get to where it is politically 
t1_dsnt1a0	0	*	Eh. Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me.
t1_dsmzkmf	0	*	Did you forget to change accounts before arguing with yourself?
t1_dsnl0rq	1	*	What universities dont allow guest attendance if there's room? From California. Educated in 3 colleges. Never heard of banning non-enrolled attendees.  But yeah, the cost is absurdly high.
t1_dub3xr7	1	*	To shreds you say?
t1_duandav	1	*	I'd prefer that they simply follow the laws and regulations they enforce... Seems much simpler.
t1_duamth2	0	*	Thanks!
t1_duayyyf	1	*	A pothole in the middle of a road isn't always going to have tires constantly hitting it.  Some driveways, for example, have tall grass growing down a strip in the middle.

t1_dtnaujd	0	*	A straw man is when you attack a made up argument as though that affects the original argument. Steele went to the media after not being taken serious by the NY FBI dept.
t1_dtn61lp	1	*	> you and your friends would all be up in arms and protesting in the streets.  It's amazing how easily they've made you see the majority of the world as 'others'.

t1_dsfh2fj	0	*	I don't know for sure but I don't think Cuba mistreats their citizens nearly as bad as NK does 
t1_dsfpjwm	1	*	Well they weren't worried about a leader that starts WW3, they were worried about electing someone who could start WW2.
t1_dsf41xh	1	*	The whole video.
t1_dsfh1bf	1	*	Lara and rigondeaux too. Both along with another boxer floated in the netherlands for a while before settling in the US.
t1_dsff9eo	1	*	Soccer is more common amongst English speaking countries. The English just have no fucking chill. 
t1_dsffvo2	1	*	China is probably distancing themselves from NK politically but in the event that the US attacked NK unprovoked they would 1000% ally with NK
t1_dsfjyxj	1	*	     POR QUE Nxc3O SERxc1 UMA OPxc7xc3O, FELLOW HUMAN?
t1_dsflznf	1	*	Well technically South Korea is still occupied by the US so North Korea will be liberating it, not occupying.
t1_dsfj9ev	1	*	Don't belive every SK media report without viewing it critically.
t1_dsgcnnd	1	*	Talking about a country without ever visiting or having any knowledge about it is a typical stupid white dude behavior so I just assumed. 
t1_dsfzfsy	0	*	Kim Jong Un threw a grenade and killed 50 people, then it exploded.
t1_dsg4a0d	0	*	Didnt say it was. Just commenting on him in general, since OP was implying that what he said yesterday wouldnt be the case today.
t1_dsfixqn	1	*	Also happens the other way around during the Fish Olympics.
t1_dsfqq7e	1	*	It was proven fake, like 50% of the things you hear about North Korea

t1_dsfnbr6	0	*	>Nice! I live in Canada and we barely show up for Summer Olympics.  Fake Canadian spotted! What are you even talking about bro? We sent 314 athletes to Rio, competed in 27 sports and won 22 medals
t1_dsfg7pw	1	*	True, but a NK that isn't as angry towards SK as towards America is still better progress than a NK angry at everyone. It's progress alright. Slow, but progress.
t1_dsfji41	1	*	Your argument is negotiating is bad, but also war is bad. Should we pretend they don't exist? Assassinate KJU? What?
t1_dsfk76y	1	*	What do you mean it may work? I just told you we can put SF units in NK. They are for observation, not capture kill. 
t1_dsghv86	1	*	We're talking about isolation and I'm saying we could make them less isolated.

t1_dsfn9ig	0	*	source? cos that sounds like some fake-ass bullshit to me.
t1_dsfk20d	1	*	You dont talk about North Korea's vast natural resources though. That surely can offset at least some cost of a unified Korea for SK.

t1_dt336gb	1	*	Ah yes  TDS, pronounced tedious
t1_dt2wfom	0	*	How is that flimsy?  The claim was he was mocking the reporters disability and those clips shows he does the same thing to everyone he mocks.
t1_dt30ja6	0	*	No shit? I never said it was a confusing concept. Its still lazy. Someone else already commented on how you vet these types of comments. Not a hard concept to understand. 
t1_dt4ad03	1	*	The Irish are pretty monolingual too. Most people don't really speak Irish well at all, definitely not fluently.

t1_dt35k8d	1	*	The purpose it serves is not being politically correct.  He walks the walk.  
t1_dt373xw	1	*	I'm being extremely reasonable. It's not my problem you can't bring valid points to a discussion.
t1_dt31h10	0	*	> Besides, i dont see a black or asian stormfront or /pol/.  Around 60% of white people would say that's Black Lives Matter.
t1_dt307d1	0	*	They independently verified a report by the Washington Post and then reported on it. This happens with all news outlets.
t1_dt3jp47	1	*	Indian languages have seven different routes. Indo European and Dravidian are only two of them. I think one is Sino Tibetan. 
t1_dt3ytw5	0	*	Now put trump in that 'poem' scenario and tell me it wouldn't be top story for 4 weeks straight
t1_dt49big	1	*	Ah, thanks! :)  I'd guess that Gujarati is slightly more distant from English than Dutch or German, but nevertheless you're right.

t1_dt52czm	1	*	I know you!!! I know your type!!!
t1_dt2zjxf	1	*	Have you *seen* a Trump rally?  Note, he's still having them as often as he did during the campaign 
t1_dt3kux0	1	*	Yes, there are a lot of *really* stupid people in our country, unfortunately.  In no way does that imply that Trump is competent.  (Hint: He's not.) 
t1_dt2wl6h	1	*	> it doesn't infuriate Pakistan  Afghan government (backed by US) does infuriate Pakistan, that's why the Pakistani security services are harboring/aiding extremist group such as the haqqani network 
t1_dt36bda	0	*	When did that happen 
t1_dtnr4dn	1	*	Hahahahaha!

t1_dtuwv1y	0	*	Wow, you're a delusional hypocrite, nice
t1_dsx7txy	1	*	Yet you forget that papodolous was caught bragging to an Australian official who notified the FBI. The steele dossier was considered important because it verified **what they already knew.**

t1_dshnupv	1	*	The problem is nobody seems to agree what *consent* is.
t1_dshk4sr	0	*	Do you regularly worry your partner will accuse you of rape because you did not explicitly receive consent? Do you believe your partner would accuse you of rape because of something they regret?
t1_du7o7wv	0	*	Are you sure you even know what you're trying to compare ?

t1_dsi0r5w	1	*	I'm not an Assange fanboy.   But justice needs to be fair for everyone. Neutral at its core by definition.   If not, there is no justice. 
t1_dsgwcdk	1	*	Would it not have been more effective to just simply link to the video of his claim?
t1_dshfwgw	1	*	So what do you think the Americans would do with him? Slap on the wrist? I think you're the one with serious delusions lad
t1_dsihlcq	1	*	I am surprised at your spontaneous display of judgment. 
t1_dsi8q2z	0	*	How about a son that identified as female?

t1_dt1qji4	0	*	facts you created from thin air
t1_dv581nv	1	*	Correct.  Which still means the law is irrelevant. If the law allowed sex with 9 year olds (prepubescent kids), that would still be child molestation, and paeeophiles would still be paedophiles.
t1_dssq86i	1	*	Oh boy
t1_dsvfg3r	1	*	How on Earth is +20 mildly cold?
t1_ds543v5	0	*	I'm just saying there is literally no feasible way to know how many crimes have occurred that haven't been reported so why are they trying to pass that off as fact? 
t1_dul43ef	0	*	Omg. CONSENT. You need consent to chop off a body part unless you are in danger of dying. The balls on this guy. WTF is wrong with you. It sounds like you hate babies.

t1_duf16o1	1	*	He *is* the Lord of the dance....said he.
t1_duf30oj	1	*	Whoa there cowboy! Maybe I should have put /s at the end to make it detectable.   However, I did Latin at school and though it sounds silly when spoken, this rule looks so much better written. 
t1_duf1o58	1	*	Meh, its ok. 
t1_duev6yv	1	*	A legit word that we don't use.
t1_duevyts	1	*	I *AM* the epicenter!
t1_duez9q2	0	*	You mean 'city'
t1_duetw8v	0	*	And Scotland.  Tea time, dinner and supper. I know they are all technically different but we use all three interchangeably.
t1_duet4nq	0	*	LOL. You are British.
t1_dueu0lt	1	*	He didnt specific whether he was a good cunt or a shit cunt. Lets not jump to conclusions.
t1_duetw3h	1	*	And bashed neeps?
t1_dtoipap	0	*	You compared Musk to Bernie Madoff earlier. Madoff worked ponzi schemes. So why did you compare Musk to Madoff if you think it is no ponzi scheme? 
t1_dtdr6ub	0	*	Yeah but your joke is cruel AND unfunny. When doing dark humor it has to make people do a little pfft as a bare minimum.
t1_dsw42gb	0	*	Thanks you! Just as a reminder, local weather is inside global weather, not separate, so, yeah, I am right! :)
t1_dtm1zgw	0	*	Do you have ill will to the US for the sanctions that disrupt your produce? I'm sorry for what you and your family have been through.
t1_dtn2xea	0	*	I mean the civilians murdered in Guatemala, Chile, Argentina and Indonesia.
t1_dtm07vy	1	*	Course. Im just saying I dont think its the best argument. If all systems are flawed in practice, saying communism is also flawed isnt really damning.
t1_dtt9ji1	1	*	It sounded like that to those with compassion reading the comments.
t1_dtm4oue	1	*	Mob mentality, always great to be on Reddit!
t1_dtm40pe	1	*	Now we call them the alt right
t1_dtm77c8	1	*	[yeah right](http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/most-guantanamo-detainees-are-innocent-ex-bush-official-1.804550)  hypocrite 
t1_du01w5v	1	*	Why do so many anti-Facebook people seem to dislike their parents so much?
t1_du07hbf	0	*	Why are you advocating that Facebook can profit off hostile foreign powers attacking vulnerable people in your own country?
t1_dtz0ro3	1	*	I was answering them as if they were an American. I'm Canadian and agree that their two parties are both on the right side of the global political spectrum.
t1_dtywyco	1	*	Just did this after having my account deactivated for 5 years and it was actually deleted. Thank you!!!
t1_dtzch43	1	*	That's all ot takes...screw the pooch and the competition swoops in...
t1_dtz0ae8	0	*	>  think people are deciding to fragment their services. Instagram for photos, Twitter for following a news feed, Meetup for event organising, WhatsApp for messaging.  What's Reddit for?  
t1_dtz2juv	1	*	Thats a wicked troll. Not wrong, though. 
t1_dtz2461	1	*	straight to the jugular :D
t1_dtz0160	1	*	Never met anyone who likes it
t1_dtyzegb	1	*	Yeah but I didnt even know how to truly delete the account, until the reply above.   So I just wanted to make the account non-functional. Anyway.. its gone now. Cheers!
t1_dtyxb2o	1	*	Thank you so much!!!!!
t1_dtyzih6	1	*	That's a great point but it'll make it much harder to find out which of my loved ones are assholes and imbeciles.
t1_du02inl	1	*	I don't doubt it, so far it seems like the best thing to do is to put your year in, then leave for the jobs that required a year of work experience.

t1_dtz4e7h	0	*	Image, moreso than ideology.  
t1_du03jxv	1	*	It gave me semantic satiation.  I'm not sure what you're getting at, though.
t1_dtz48ti	0	*	I have disagreed with the sensationalist nature of more than one article in that sub. You're right they do this thing called disagreeing and that's totally ok with me. 
t1_dtz1t80	0	*	Never said they didn't, I was refuting the concept of communist China. Communism in China is dead, and it is now another capitalist state 
t1_dtz46yd	0	*	Personally its one of the main reasons I hate facebook.
t1_dtz428z	1	*	Agreed. I wish you could have messenger without needing a full profile, or could just use calendar events with notifications without getting spammed with all the rest of it.
t1_dtywrkj	0	*	Let's all just calm down and have some Tide Pods.
t1_dtz2p4o	1	*	Wrong.  > There's a level of admiration I actually have with China because their basic dictatorship is allowing them to actually turn their economy around on a dime.  - https://youtu.be/l8wQrM5jTWc
t1_dtyyh9d	0	*	Yes. These people are dense and haven't watched the full video, or they want to keep spreading their side's nonsense.
t1_du0pf9k	0	*	newp watched the whole thing. It's not out of context, and it's irrelevant to my narrative. But keep it up, trooper! Keep on believing that Trudeau is infallible and can do no wrong!
t1_dtz2tdr	0	*	You also fucking matter, and don't let anyone prove you otherwise. 
t1_dtzmtmq	1	*	You can expect this to go about the same way Reddit's Big Short of EA did.
t1_dtz3kgh	0	*	That you don't have standing to be criticizing anyone.
t1_dtz344t	0	*	Because you're misinforming other people, and seem to at least be pretending to care about that sort of thing. 
t1_dtzpwig	1	*	Why ignorant? I'd like to learn from any mistake I might be making.
t1_du03lan	0	*	Nice you brought that up, please justify that one. Checkmate. 
t1_dtyvkpc	1	*	Crazy nonsense? Thats his bread and butter. Trudeau eats that shit for breakfast. If I had another food idiom, itd go here too.
t1_dtzn91x	1	*	When?
t1_dtztlhl	0	*	kind of sucks they have different views from us
t1_dtzc3xs	0	*	He said it was a dumb joke
t1_du0vo4p	1	*	In the end, you might be right. Now I see it everywhere; I might have just not taken note of it before.

t1_dtz5trj	1	*	Oh, that totally makes sense
t1_dtz39jy	1	*	and there are millions of dead people's account. It kinda has become an online graveyard.
t1_dtzr5wa	0	*	Watching the video I determined two things, 1)it was a joke. 2) Trudeau is not a funny man.
t1_dtz3qhu	0	*	>I was banned from /r/politics for suggesting not all trumps ideas are bad...  No you weren't. 
t1_dtzjl6s	0	*	Everyone does it a lot, I lean to the left but theres no question that liberals take things out of context as well. Saying stuff like that doesnt get us anywhere.
t1_dtqtook	1	*	Aviation is a subcategory of aeronautics which is a subcategory if aerospace. 
t1_du7a5dj	1	*	> If you could bring attention to those crass human right abuses by the first-world nations  Do you have a top 3? Drone strikes? Rendition kidnappings? ???
t1_du7331z	1	*	I can't
t1_duqoso8	1	*	Idk Im American, I just like complaining about my country 
t1_duqn5g4	1	*	Rod Rosenstein appointed Mueller to investigate a firing he advised Trump to make... Does that not seem even a little weird?
t1_duqzcvf	1	*	Got away with...? Ruining social security? Im a millennial, so all I know Regan for is Star Wars, deficit spending, and borrowing money from social security. 
t1_duqsm9l	1	*	Nothing gets Mueller more hard than justice.
t1_duqlydv	0	*	New head, ye say?? 
t1_duqlfn7	1	*	Im totally using this when I teach my students about the 80s.
t1_duqtwpz	1	*	It would be amazing...but they might. I continue to be amazed at the shamelessness these guys have. They just give zero fucks. 
t1_duqp6ni	1	*	> My friend Jim is a good person.  I wouldn't use commas at all in that sentence unless Jim is your only friend (and maybe not even then unless you'd expect your audience to know that).  
t1_duqxwrh	1	*	Definitely wouldve worked on me. 
t1_duqw1zc	0	*	Or... in any case really.  This sounds as bad as talking to a cop without your lawyer present.
t1_dura23x	0	*	Let's be honest here, look how far we've gone from a brief misstep in an otherwise bland debate to where we are now.
t1_durlixq	1	*	Nope. Comparative terms. One is worse than the other. No one said anything about how bad either are on their own, just compared to each other. Try re-reading the post. 
t1_duq6jvb	0	*	But some do. I saw someone actually get gilded in /r/the_donald once. 
t1_duqqnh6	1	*	It might be better for Gates and Manafort to be tried in Virginia (whose courts handle lots of DC matters) and the Trumplings to be handled by NY prosecutors.
t1_duqsflo	0	*	In every way
t1_duqrfip	0	*	I'm doing fine, thanks.
t1_dur31jb	1	*	And not just American values either
t1_duqp7ja	1	*	I really like it. It flat out calls him out and points out the hypocrisy of fox news. It explains the whole issue on a level anyone can understand. 
t1_duqq1w8	1	*	This is literally the story of Trump's business and political life.
t1_duqbbln	0	*	It was public knowledge, so it should have been. If they didnt know any basic background check would have found it. 
t1_duqu4je	1	*	If anyone had anything legitimate on trump it would have come out by now. Not 13 indictments on Internet trolls. 
t1_durvzxq	0	*	Do you not realise that filing charges are not the only part of the job? They also need to find this thing called evidence, you know so they have a strong case? 
t1_durilzu	0	*	That's nice, are they criminals or not?   >Except for the lying about what they were caught for,   To the FBI, yes. Do you honestly think you're successfully squirming out of this right now? 
t1_duqtzsr	1	*	So weird that we've come to the point that this is a good question that may soon require an answer.
t1_dur28hb	1	*	Not when you eat as many saturated fats as Trump does.
t1_duqsc05	0	*	I dont see a Russian murder, although it could be the icing on the cake. Not only can we control your elections, but we can murder your citizens at will.
t1_durx715	1	*	Are you implying that I was implying that he didn't?
t1_duqmnme	1	*	Like in trouble at the state level
t1_duqbwpq	0	*	He's already disgraced. 
t1_duqni2w	1	*	Only 34 score... I feel bad for the author for all that work.
t1_duqv004	0	*	Obstruction? It's not like they need a formal request. I believe a few people have already moved to impeach. They've just obviously been ignored.
t1_dur3yax	1	*	In order to drain the swamp you must become it. Then get it arrested and charged for treason.
t1_duqoia6	1	*	Terrifying; true 
t1_duq9mi2	0	*	Yeah. And...  I feel like Im having a battle of wits with an unarmed opponent. 
t1_duqqtuc	1	*	It's remarkable. Reagan was one of the most brazenly traitorous presidents of all time and he's hardly ever called out as such.
t1_dur2ygj	1	*	Someone dealing weed, who can hit 8 years for that, is ridiculous. I get my weed from somewhere as it's illegal, a dealer, and that person risking their freedom is ridiculous. 
t1_duqr520	0	*	It was Flavor-Aid  you filthy casual p.s. I am kidding, but my college poly sci professor told me about it not being koolaid, so idk it's up for debate. 
t1_duqr3r6	1	*	LOL insane Trump supporter 
t1_duqxb6f	1	*	You, suspect the maybe.
t1_duqqhls	1	*	I may have misunderstood what charges they're dropping for his cooperation, but don't get caught with drugs unless you can sell out someone who may have committed treason :p
t1_duqph7v	1	*	The feds do not currently use private prisons.  Although this may change under the current admin.
t1_duqm3oh	0	*	You're telling me nobody has surpassed 8 years for possession?  Really? 
t1_duql0ys	0	*	So if Trump resigns can Pence pardon Gates and Manafort, etc. or do they still have to serve their sentences?
t1_duqockz	0	*	Whoah that's fucked up. Everyone deserves their weed, even retards
t1_dsopg4p	1	*	Correct
t1_dsp5q15	0	*	Yeah I've traveled all around the world as an american, both as a sightseers and a worker, and your story just reeks of bullshit. 
t1_dspsah5	0	*	I did not support this decision. The fact that world leaders made this decision regarding Russia does not give us an excuse to be bigoted. 
t1_dsp0h0u	0	*	I didn't really get it either.  Why is discrimination based on nationality ok?   Isn't it just as bigoted as discrimination by race? I don't really see a difference.
t1_dujhwge	1	*	No, they didn't, and it's disgusting that you continue to support a genocide. 
t1_dtjfni3	1	*	I'm aware, just saying that the Yank closed down so while it may have made sense at the time it's just a piece of history. 
t1_dtja997	1	*	Can confirm, can't walk down the street here without watching someone fucking a sheep. Lock me up!
t1_dtjwuwb	1	*	Well a little more extreme but you could argue that yeah
t1_dtj7qm1	0	*	So basically r/ politics
t1_dv54jx3	1	*	Well it happened in isolation, 
t1_dsz4wrp	0	*	 Not an argument for it being allowed, nor was it a response to an argument against it being allowed.    You're obviously confused.
t1_dtxitot	1	*	I think he meant to say wahabi sheiks
t1_dtxjmre	0	*	Peter Parker?  Edit: Who downvoted me? Spiderman's parents died in a plane crash. I will fight you ^^^not ^^^really
t1_dtxtzt2	1	*	A rational human being would kill the man who tried to oppose such tyrannical laws upon them. As they should. Always.
t1_dtptgnd	0	*	I guess you haven't been reading about Strzok lately either or you wouldn't be using him to prop up this narrative.   
t1_dtq2j6c	0	*	It's ok. The people who have drunk the kool aid are victims too. They need help.
t1_duu5eiv	0	*	How many stabbings did he reward?
t1_duuxauh	1	*	Im well aware of South Africas policies.  Where do I talk about hats? Pretty stupid really. 
t1_dtsj5m6	0	*	What chips are Chinese?
t1_dtnou45	0	*	>Refusing to help other countries isn't going to do shit to advance any of the things you're talking about.  It will save money that we can use on domestic policies instead
t1_du14d2b	0	*	Well, since the article doesn't provide any numbers to incorporate into / change  my original statement, this comment is rather pointless, isn't it?
t1_dtojfl1	0	*	LOL I was just pointing out your terrible analogy. 
t1_dtoh6zr	1	*	Good. 
t1_dtoi1k1	1	*	Lol not many people will get this
t1_dtoy551	0	*	I havent been to Russia but I've been to enough other European places to know that the further east you go, the more racism you'll find.  Don't defend countries you haven't been to.
t1_dtooc1r	0	*	Its coo, not sure I'd want upvote support from people defending an ideology that has killed over a hundred million people for  in the past hundred years for filthy capitalist wrongthink!
t1_dton9nx	0	*	I learned about it in high school in the 90s...
t1_dtohbp8	0	*	Oh there is the constant confederate flag waving, murals to slave masters, high schools named after Robert E Lee  And the flagrant gerrymandering used to suppress the black vote.
t1_dtp27iy	1	*	The best counter factual is in WII in north Africa. Rommel had italians fights very well when they had competent leadership and modern arms.
t1_dtomtm1	1	*	And need to arrest everyone named Luca obvi.
t1_dtogrwr	1	*	Was WW2 not enough??
t1_dtohgly	1	*	i dont care who you are. but if you throw acid into someones face that should be life in prison. you've just fucked someones life up and proven we don't need you in the civilized world
t1_dtotxk8	1	*	Is this a joke or are you using your phone to post this?   Because exasterbating is illegal in most southern states. 
t1_dtohl6z	1	*	>Neither were Irish  Sort of. AFAIK, the Irish were allowed in all-white contexts (e.g. schools) but were definitely discriminated against. 
t1_dtokfec	0	*	It's fancy-talk for and Bob's your uncle.
t1_dtont51	1	*	And yet it was one of you who ran over a woman in Charlottesville. 
t1_dtou0zh	0	*	Never did I blame every white person alive today for colonialism. But it's important to understand that colonialism from Europe *was* perpetrated by white men. 
t1_dtokdnz	1	*	They definitely do! The old Polish lady across the alley from me (real nice lady) always complains about how mean and boorish those Poles are.
t1_dtoi4dv	0	*	My personal experience is the opposite with the exception of parts of SA. But then again in SA once people found out I wasn't Afrikaner I never had any problem either. 
t1_dtoo5np	0	*	he's just pointing out a double standard. its not that deep. 
t1_dtoji2x	0	*	Also their should be theyre since youre using it as a contraction of they are. So it should be everyone knows theyre fascists.  :) Great English skills for a non-native speaker btw. 
t1_dtoi77p	1	*	And the Irish. Seriously, in the US, the Irish and the Italians have like a racism Olympics for who can come up with the most creative derogatory terms for black people. 
t1_dtogg8v	0	*	Depends where you're talking. In Ireland, they will be. In a country that is seeing a wave of Irish immigration that is causing social tension, perhaps they won't. 
t1_dtoozxq	1	*	Are you mentally deficient 
t1_dtoxio8	1	*	But most people have learned about Q39, that's my spot in Westport.
t1_dtolpwy	1	*	Don't forget the Polish camps
t1_dtomeq9	0	*	That was fascinating. Thanks for sharing.
t1_dtphcwa	1	*	The girl who was chopped up and dumped in briefcases by the migrant who triggered this jackass never made any international news.
t1_dtovns5	0	*	u/PilotGuy30 is a frequent commenter in r/The_Donald. No one is going to be able to explain to him how he's wrong, because he's just not going to listen. Don't waste your time.
t1_dtp0iup	1	*	I recently saw a work truck with a Confederate flag winter cover on the front.
t1_dtoteu6	0	*	Why do you bring that up ?
t1_dtol0yq	1	*	Play Bloodborne instead
t1_dtq4h26	0	*	Then you should know better if you are in Italy, if you are not then skip the comments...
t1_dtoloyi	0	*	Yeah, in my opinion too!
t1_dtomfd5	0	*	Wasn't it Italy that needed to temporarily import USAF ATCs because they couldn't handle the bombing operation in Libya? And then ran out of bombs?
t1_dton28u	1	*	Good catch 
t1_dtoww93	0	*	Yup. Not as many Italians as Japanese, though. 
t1_dtokm6i	0	*	Black panthers were not fascist, nation of Islam is much more apt.  The Panthers may have wanted to separate from whites but they were definitely socialist radicals.
t1_dtp1vcx	1	*	>Robert E Lee was a horrible person  So was Sherman, perhaps even more so, and there is a gilded statue of him in New York.
t1_dtorplm	0	*	Same deal with Ireland. Our most ultra-nationalist party, Sinn Fein, is also our only major lefty party. It's weird. 
t1_dtoh8d6	1	*	Commenting here because Im interested in seeing how he responds.
t1_dtp06zy	1	*	Out of curiosity - how so?
t1_dtooq28	0	*	No, just some bystanders.

t1_dtoit4l	1	*	i would think the only people who would be against that would be actual racists and fuck them lol
t1_dtoj29h	1	*	I think most people saying white they dont mean the color necessarily. But it seems strange to me since it then defeats the purpose :)
t1_dtoncsq	1	*	Intolerance of intolerance is not wrong
t1_dtora4g	1	*	I thought they had a pact of steel, stating no war would be started until Italy had caught up it's military, then Germany invaded Poland anyway, leaving Italy trailing behind militarily. 
t1_dtoyg9c	0	*	Get a brain. 
t1_dtpruzg	1	*	Aha! It makes even more sense. Meanwhile, there's questions about how long Mussolini languished after recovering from his wounds in the Great War.
t1_dtoxbtg	1	*	What's sad is that some people still glorify the people who led the terrors. 
t1_dtoxb5o	1	*	60% of the Waffen SS was foreign.  Russians, Ukrainians, Croatians, Belgians, French, Gerogians, Turks, Azeris.  Practically everyone except Poles and Jews.

t1_dtc98j3	1	*	Wait a sec, I think thats my bad and this is a friendly fire misunderstanding. I agree. It doesnt matter.
t1_dtch4nv	1	*	that's because the previous poster is misinformed. they never delete and almost never ban anyone. It took months to bad OBVIOUS BOTS for goodness sakes.
t1_dtc5lu2	1	*	Well, I haven't participated recently but my experience has always been that they allow for free comments but delete posts and only ban users if they always post (not comment) stuff against the rules.
t1_dt2skd1	1	*	So are stolen goods. I believe on one of the US tax forms there is a checkmark and line where you can account for the net value of all the things you have stolen in the past year.
t1_dt2xaf2	1	*	Interesting turn of phrase.
t1_dt3fhhr	1	*	That's not how it works, you're responsible for proof of your own claim; the burden of proving you correct is not mine to bear.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof
t1_dtyrffj	1	*	yeah.. the point the Americans see is.. we better fuck this guy up sooner rather than let them stall in pointless peace talks like they always do, then withdraw, while advancing their weapon programs.
t1_dtx9ki3	1	*	Good always wins because whoever wins is 'good'...
t1_dtuilub	0	*	Not precisely no. Dropped means the case is just done. But if he goes to Sweden before the statute of limitations passes it will just continue on as normal.

t1_dumt303	0	*	Ahh profiling...bold strategy Cotton
t1_dudsoau	0	*	But were the numbers accurate and the opinion is frowned upon, or was the data twisted to match opinion? (Or both/neither)
t1_dsckvda	0	*	Why should ANY group ANYWHERE be expected to have to come out to say that ANY country has a right to exist for ONE particular religious, racial, or ethnic group??
t1_dv1z5no	1	*	How dare they!?
t1_dtb8ivm	0	*	Its ok. Thanks for the conversation. It truly is a great time to be alive. 
t1_ds60t0f	0	*	Yet youre here on Reddit, an American website. This entire exchange of information and your account is because of American engineering and hosting.

t1_dv2dhs8	1	*	i know, and they're idiots for it. what's your point?
t1_dv3hrp1	1	*	Interestingly, most gun control laws stem from a desire to keep guns out of colored peoples hands.  Its the last of the socially acceptable Jim Crow laws.
t1_dv37c8w	1	*	Amazing....you disagree with everyone!
t1_dv2hgbj	0	*	Farms most likely stolen by the forced relocation of the former locals.
t1_dv2iuio	0	*	Hutchinson is not moderate.  He was the chief NRA spokesman before he became governor.  He was also the federal drug czar.  His opposition isn't a hardline conservative, she's a raving lunatic.

t1_dv2kt53	1	*	totally concur with Russia being very hostile, and aggressive.  But what is going to get from what you said that he couldn't get from Reddit?  I'm not even sure Trump could be useful as an Idiot.
t1_dv2ff3j	1	*	Let faith be your shield
t1_dv3ioz3	0	*	Refusing to accept is awfully similar to rejecting.

t1_duge3p3	1	*	Makes sense. Thanks for the info! 
t1_dtj1h9p	1	*	Make sure you get his appendix removed also, just so he might not have to get it removed later in life. Better to just do it when he's an infant and won't remember it.
t1_dtj3g4e	0	*	Ya, but other people might miss that and assume you mean for all men.  Wanted to make it clearer for other readers than OP.
t1_dtje7vb	0	*	How do you know this?

t1_dtj6zb8	0	*	Whoops!  You are correct, I did misunderstand.

t1_dtjf4is	1	*	I've heard that argument before, that it messes people up mentally, but nobody actually brought that up, so it just kinda looks like a dumb statement. Oh well
t1_dtj0g51	0	*	You are a terrible person.
t1_dtki5vn	0	*	Wait, what?  Jesus, I understand that you've picked a side, but at least be rational about this.

t1_dtjjku4	0	*	I can only speak for myself. But calling me disfigured is kinda fucked up. Accusing my parents of mutilating me is kinda fucked up.
t1_dtjgv4c	1	*	I didn't say anything about cutting hair being permanent.  But now that you mention it, that would be awfully convenient.
t1_dtk1z52	1	*	I hear joking complaints  
t1_dtm2ub8	1	*	The truth hurts.
t1_dtjv0ph	1	*	I didn't even know what foreskin was until I was like 15. None of my friends are uncircumcised. Also, I never really compared junk with my friends growing up haha

t1_dsk4cg2	0	*	No it's not.. rape and sex with children has always been forbidden within Islam and has a punishment up to death.
t1_dsjmzyr	1	*	That's how you get refugees, but for some reason a lot of governments don't want to accept those.

t1_dv0yhvl	0	*	Your edit seems very contradictory were they great dogs or were they put down for behavioral issues?

t1_dv2yhih	0	*	The average car includes about $830 of steel and $400 of aluminum (source: Bloomberg) - estimates show the tariffs will add approximately $200 to the total price of a vehicle.
t1_dv1p3mu	1	*	No. They're saying that the US Steel industry is operating near or at capacity, and can't ramp up production to meet demand in a reasonable time frame.
t1_dv1tzr1	1	*	Woah I can't believe I've never heard of that. Thanks for sharing! I was on mobile earlier which isn't great for doing research
t1_dv3llz8	0	*	This sounds like something I need to Google lol
t1_dv1tnm3	0	*	No, not really. What got us into this shit show is things like allowing corporations to fund politics to the degree that they do and a 2 party system.
t1_dv1lcth	0	*	Ahhh shit, I got my basic math mixed up.   Ok fine, let's revisit this convo in 18 months. 
t1_dv1ujqy	1	*	Do you want war? Because that is how you start a war under this admin.
t1_dv1prqy	0	*	It's potato quality.
t1_dv1vd3b	1	*	http://sliger.com is me but also check out /r/sffpc if you're interested in small PC cases!
t1_dv1uqra	0	*	Where at least you know you're breezy.
t1_dv32jlq	1	*	r/madlads
t1_dv1y06m	1	*	For starters, they won't be paying an extra 25% for their steel...
t1_dv22n6q	0	*	Strict non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) are pretty common these days for almost anything in the defense industry. They're a pretty big deal. 
t1_dv1wuto	0	*	> Trump is negatively affecting the entire world as much as he is affecting Americans  lol no
t1_dv2acr6	0	*	Which tribalism is that? I'm surprised you could discern anything from me other than thinking you're a ridiculous caricature.
t1_dv1thj9	0	*	Go back to /r/Canada 
t1_dv3fob0	1	*	Where we're going, we don't need strategies.
t1_dv2bk51	1	*	Am Canadian. Most of us would have voted Sanders. Given the choice between HC & DT we would have selected option C. 
t1_dv1ud65	0	*	You can take my oil, you can take my luxury properties, but my when you take my original recipe extra crispy with a side of mac n cheese that is the last straw!
t1_dv2l7kd	1	*	Really depends whether or not Russia wants him again.
t1_dv1jc2l	1	*	He's doing some mental gymnastics to try and look smart by trying to point out a simple fact and turn it as wrong.
t1_dv1wqlo	1	*	Alright then have fun being physically ill all the time. Thought I had a solution for you but I guess the thought of leaving your abusive government is just too stupid. 
t1_dv1gqtu	1	*	There is no EU free trade agreement with the US
t1_dv1u8j3	1	*	Lmao...if you say so
t1_dv1wj05	0	*	Honest to God I want to know so much more. I have always wondered about screw construction, but don't know how to Google more info.
t1_dv22sdt	0	*	> Trudeau has actually made a bit of an effort to get along with him.  Surviving the initial handshake salvo probably elevated him in Trump's eyes. That sounds even stupider to write out explicitly.
t1_dv25p1n	0	*	What the password to get into the fantasy world you're living in?
t1_dv1tfx3	0	*	I was going to guess coal mine. I don't think he could stand working around so many terrorist illegals at 7-11.
t1_dv2cw4d	1	*	By who, I wonder...? 
t1_dv1ponq	1	*	Don't you mean he grows his camera along with the rest of his potatoes?
t1_dv1tqy9	0	*	Computers = Silicon = Rocks.  QED, BITCHES! 
t1_dv1vdhh	0	*	The EU did. 
t1_dv1p25u	1	*	Yes. Now tell us more. 
t1_dv1zf5v	1	*	I'm hoping he's the much needed immunity shot 
t1_dv1se91	1	*	Your point about increased automation destroying entry-level and journeyman jobs is spot on. I don't think enough people see this.
t1_dv1q3bo	1	*	Yeah I still want the guys driving to come and have some poutine with me, and I'll tell them all about how I'm sorry. I don't want to blow them up! 
t1_dv1pw80	0	*	25 per cent = 25 / 100 = 1/4 = 25 percent ???
t1_dv1v8fm	1	*	True, and I always try to remind myself of this, however, I'm not sure what we should do with the nihilists that voted for him out of spite to hurt the people they hate. 
t1_dv1ukz6	1	*	Or a call center. 
t1_dv1npyu	1	*	And then he won't pay them, therefore Mexico paid for it
t1_dv30lj6	1	*	Trump doesn't have opinions of his own. 
t1_dv1zowa	1	*	Why, for making the US be more independent? I thought that's what Trump wanted.
t1_dv2x762	1	*	Trump's strategy is to stir shit to make himself look strong & active.
t1_dv25tyb	1	*	They also banned people for *agreeing* with him in a hilarious twist, since even though their idol said it, being pro gun control is a no go over there. 
t1_dv2cx0l	1	*	Undermine the USA to bolster Putin?
t1_dv1say5	1	*	that's insane, join the union as an electrician and you're set for life. Good dependable work and a fucking pension. 
t1_dv2cgxf	1	*	Different people: different attitudes 
t1_dv21snz	0	*	There's more to it. There was still opposition to all this in the 90s but Clinton and other neoliberal went full new economy in tandem with Republicans and that's how we got here. 
t1_dv1prqd	0	*	Its not interference, its just the game of politics.
t1_dv21zo8	1	*	Damn.  $13 an hour is offensive.
t1_dv1zxvd	0	*	I think you misread my comment, do you know what guise means?  Heres another source: https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/efw/efw2017/efw-2017-chapter-2.pdf
t1_dv21d3u	1	*	I seem to remember the 2016 democratic nominee getting about as many votes as Obama did in 2008.
t1_dv1tlv4	1	*	I'm not sure if you're joking or not, but by that metric literally any country with any kind of foreign policy is interfering in each other's elections. 
t1_dv2fcom	1	*	*the world 
t1_dt6lh9b	0	*	>punch him in the face   What kinda job do you have where you get punched in the face? Are you in the martial arts business?
t1_dt5rwq7	1	*	> about being called a Nazi after marching with a swastika?  They could be devout Hindus \s 
t1_dt0mwj1	0	*	>What has someone to do to deserve it?   Joining the Islamic state is more than enough for me.
t1_dt0hr1i	0	*	Whattaboutism. I agree with you that the US is a dirty, dirty nation, but don't deflect and answer the man's question. Are those reasons enough in your eyes to kill people?
t1_dt1bqwx	1	*	True
t1_dt321n0	1	*	Even so that doesn't remove the justice from these specific executions.   I'm not on Iraq's side, I'm just against ISIS.
t1_dt0ln81	0	*	It really makes my head hurt how to Americans the term government includes courts like separation of power doesn't exist.  
t1_dt0yt5z	1	*	Someone who becomes a terrorist because an ISIS member was executed was already headed down that road anyways.  It's like a white person saying a BLM protest turned them racist.
t1_dt0t1jz	1	*	Things the average citizen has no control over or say in.
t1_dt1472v	1	*	You dont need solitary to confine lifers with other lifers
t1_dt0s0ax	0	*	Not my hands - I'm not a part of the military nor do I support it nor the politics behind it.
t1_dt0sgu2	1	*	People always bring up Europe when they want to tell the us what its doing wrong.
t1_dt1ajdg	0	*	Try saying that out loud on the streets
t1_dt0sp6p	0	*	Apparently, I missed the not in your comment. That changes a lot. You seem a bit more rational now. 
t1_dt0jbgm	1	*	Bin Laden was US buddy up until he decided that he didnt want US in Afghanistan - not a US territory. Can we say that he and Taliban were killed due a disagreement?
t1_dugaadq	1	*	I'm glad you can make jokes about this. I see it as a serious issue.
t1_dugeeqp	1	*	As long as we still go after the adult who brought them here. Sure.  DACA is pretty clear cut imho.
t1_duh4eoo	0	*	Nah, the exchange rate is too high. Give em like $800 that's like $4,000 in Mexico 
t1_dugcj4u	1	*	[Money talks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efra%C3%ADn_R%C3%ADos_Montt#US_and_Israeli_backing).
t1_dugty35	0	*	Catch me next week when I get caught publically wanking into a fountain   And in all seriousness, political protest is not virtue signalling. It can make a difference.
t1_duga33b	1	*	I meant decent not recent immigration. This only show recent migration.    Over 50% of the Jewish population is of at least a partial Sephardi/Mizrahi descent 
t1_duggaj2	0	*	Incorrect, served myself in the IDF with 2 Muslim Arabs , 6 Druze , 2 Muslim circassians and 1 Christian Arab all in one unit. It's not a state secret you can Google it.
t1_dughvlo	0	*	Never said that. But they can become citizen anytime, so theres that...
t1_dugfq1g	1	*	I bet these fuckers would also want to arrest and deport runaway slaves in 1860 because UPHOLD THE LAW.
t1_dugbt10	0	*	Lots of people like to support rogue terrorist states. Your point? 
t1_dug29o9	0	*	I'm sure they feel very safe being that wealthy, too.  /s, obviously.
t1_dugazxo	0	*	We give Israel more purchasing power, which might as well mean were giving them money
t1_duge20p	0	*	Sure proof sure, isreal and Mossad are pro in hiding proofs their whole life is a lie 
t1_dugcsue	1	*	Ah yes, that too.
t1_dugdinr	1	*	Oh. Thanks. 
t1_dugb4oo	1	*	General Misquoti!
t1_dsuvsg3	0	*	I really dont think she was seeing it as a national issue thats for sure. And heh, yes, I've lied to cops before...
t1_dsv6js6	1	*	> They don't just say it wasn't me  Well, that's your failure as a parent, then.  You have to teach them the Shaggy Defense while they're still young.  
t1_dsva5x4	1	*	citation needed.  I went back to see if I had bothered to post on the original threads from last week, and i didn't.   I think you crossed a wire friend. 
t1_duc1jfz	0	*	You sound like a typical idiot Russian who will die of Cirrhosis at 50.  You're probably still living with mommy and daddy and have never left your hometown.
t1_dsksknc	1	*	It must be nice to be so privileged that one can just ignore politics.
t1_dskp6wa	0	*	There isnt a statistical representation for that, so assigning a number to it, is just pure bullshit.
t1_dskrruj	0	*	Its not about avoidance, the tax rate is lower even if you pay everything 
t1_dskg1jy	1	*	He just seemed to know what he was doing. Seemed educated? Well spoken an. Well versed. I don't agree with everything he says but you could see his heart was in the right place. 
t1_dsko1np	1	*	Vacancy? 
t1_dsl2rlr	0	*	Yeah, implying sarcasm as a joke is difficult to read in text. 
t1_dsklzu8	0	*	I'm proud of my abhorrent comment to post karma ratio. I contribute nothing. 
t1_dskpkcb	0	*	Nigeria is part of the Commonwealth 
t1_dskmtwf	0	*	Are you saying theyre shithole states? 
t1_dskmrn8	0	*	^ It was too hard so we didn't even try.  Sorry, I'm not buying it. 
t1_dskp6xi	1	*	haha it's ok, i got it
t1_dsklus7	0	*	You've just got to post a lot of non controversial comments in really big subs and you'll get there eventually. 
t1_dskt71m	0	*	lol I specifically chose the word affluent to try to avoid any nitpicking about rich/middle class/whatever.
t1_dskppzz	1	*	Kleptocracy- Putin style.
t1_dskyihj	1	*	Lol
t1_dtbz549	1	*	Sorry about that!  I really appreciate it!  
t1_dt50wrt	1	*	Yeah.. thats not working. Do we have anything in the bag that actually works? This jerry-rigged system is starting to give out.
t1_dt21fp8	1	*	Except it isn't. A population does not need 100% of its members to procreate. In fact, if everyone procreates it's typically detrimental to the population, because resources are limited.
t1_dt2204h	1	*	Just the tip then.
t1_dt1or3b	1	*	Or all those billions of humans over the years that didn't have kids? Or all those brave young warriors that died in wars and never got to pass on their alpha genes lol?
t1_durfzez	1	*	Yes, which is why I listed them as one of the do not donate charities. Luckily they're more of an exception than the rule. 
t1_dur3m9x	1	*	No we don't hate the Chinese.  
t1_dtzmosy	1	*	Humans are also animals
t1_dtzkqv5	1	*	Not eating meat *is* the solution though. Until we can get lab meat at least. 
t1_dtzmakx	0	*	Ah fuck, I cant believe youve done this
t1_dtzinwl	1	*	I like my steaks rare.
t1_dtzjf3x	1	*	The solution is to not unneccessarily kill other beings for our own selfish reasons. The solution is staring us in the face.
t1_dtzvlng	1	*	Such a lack of respect for life makes me fucking sick. That was worse than anything I've seen on r/watchpeopledie
t1_dtzvsmp	0	*	To be fair that's usually an improvement in Wyoming, as it provides a distraction from the endless barren landscape and occasional oil refinery.
t1_du0bdmi	0	*	If you're not vegan then, what, you're just a giant hypocrite?
t1_dtzof25	1	*	 >But you're right. Since we can't one hundred percent avoid harming others, we just shouldn't try at all. That seems logical.  Whoops, ran a stop sign. Might as well murder somebody. 
t1_dtzi0ri	1	*	God will you quit pretending youre better than me because you dont kill animals for your enjoyment? 
t1_dtzla9j	1	*	replace mosquito with fly that is buzzing around my computer screen 
t1_dtzleea	1	*	This is the worst attempt at guilding, maybe ever.  Im going to use this
t1_dtznwyw	1	*	Yeah exactly.
t1_dtzm51y	1	*	Haha, true that. Username does not check out, but I just chose it randomly because it was one of my favorite meals as a kid, made by Colombian father. 
t1_du0ehkt	1	*	I won't house them, but I won't pay off a hitman either.
t1_dtzs7w6	1	*	So if you saw a suffering animal and there was no way to save it, surely the humane thing to do is to put it down and end that suffering? 
t1_dtzh913	1	*	Yeah, that guy's just being a cunt on a high horse.
t1_dtzq3rg	0	*	It doesn't matter what block chain is being used, all use the same fundamentals. Multiple confirmations, and info is stored in all users.
t1_du0ice4	0	*	Then the price goes up. We need to put our morals first. 
t1_dtzps31	1	*	r/forwardsfromgrandma
t1_dtzrgsw	1	*	Yeah its gotta suck living in a country that is a captured agency.
t1_dtzttxe	0	*	No clearly it isn't all equal but the vast majority of the meat that is sold comes from factory farms with abysmal conditions.  Only the exceptions come from humane slaughter.
t1_dtzjpym	0	*	Not in the way caging them up to never see sunlight or frolic in a field is :/ Also, tell that to the foxes that tried to eat our chickens and bunnies.
t1_dtztiw7	0	*	Kolla kartan, brorsan.
t1_du0aztw	0	*	Maybe it was Khorne himself, or some other Chaos entity to jumpstart the inevitable collapse. The long con man, and it all started with a poor animal who happened to waltz around some lunatics
t1_dtziv6l	0	*	What difference does it make? 
t1_dtzkyv1	1	*	I can only speak for Australia and the UK, but nah that stuff doesn't happen here. It's all grass feed, I believe that it's legislated. 
t1_du10r25	1	*	There's not contest here. No oil equals widespread famine. Not eating meat is.. slightly inconvenient for a small period of time.
t1_dtzz8w8	1	*	Agreed. Exactly. Definitely. Absolutely.
t1_dtzymqd	0	*	You should've put ShockinglyIgnorant as a nickname.
t1_dtznf90	0	*	I stopped eating turkey after I actually met one in person.  He was smart, and sweet, and had a life of his own.  I just don't want to eat turkey any more somehow.  
t1_du1hfve	0	*	You're so dumb for that
t1_dtzyafu	0	*	Because, like I said, it would be wrong to let those delicious beasts go to waste.  
t1_dtzyul5	1	*	It's fair because there's nothing stopping you or me from donating tens of thousands to a politician. We're free to lobby just like anybody else xaf\\\_()_/xaf
t1_du07wvk	1	*	The GOP, being fucking stupid as usual
t1_dtzlh9q	1	*	Well Im not a Nazi. I never said anything remotely similar to a Nazi policy. Anyway did you look up those definitions?
t1_dtzghy3	0	*	Pound for pound I guess
t1_dtzicv4	0	*	The word youre looking for is slaughterhouse, mate. 
t1_du01n78	0	*	Are you certain that the animals are being treated ethically? Laws are routinely ignored when it comes to animal agriculture, so I think you're being too complacent.
t1_dtzrhaz	1	*	No one is being rude or smug to you... Why are you acting like this? I don't have anything against you, I'm just trying to have a discussion.
t1_dtzpgpb	1	*	People have been killed for picking mushrooms in someone elses spot. This wouldnt surprise me at all. 
t1_du036i3	0	*	> life doesn't exist to be your food  That is exactly why animals are farmed. Good grief.
t1_dtzqsn9	0	*	> It is important to our bodies to stay within what nature intended us to eat  If you're not talking about health, then why is this important?
t1_dtzkohd	0	*	Which brand?

t1_dtzpfu5	0	*	Aight fam, I'll let you know how my Bacon Parmesan burgers I'm making to grill up later this afternoon turn out  Peace
t1_dtzspt9	1	*	Same. If I ever hear a convincing argument I might go back, but I very much doubt that I ever will.
t1_du0q5u0	1	*	I'd probably go to a coffee shop or something for that so sure. Except those things don't impact your health like say spongiform encephalopathy would from eating diseased animals.
t1_dtzsiit	1	*	So your philosophy on ethics is whatever makes you not have to think or change ...
t1_du1ellm	0	*	Yes, I live in Seattle actually! We actually banned plastic bags, and charge of nickel per paper bag.  Disposable bag usage went down by 85%. Huge win. We also banned styrofoam containers!
t1_dtzh04q	0	*	If raised humanely, the life a farm animal lives certainly no more cruel than what an animal in the wild would experience on average. Unnecessary, sure, but not cruel.
t1_dtzr59r	1	*	>Obviously the goal is for people to be 100% vegan  How is that obvious and who set that goal?
t1_du5hjg9	1	*	The human race has also been raping for tens of thousands of years--somehow we've agreed that's not a cool thing to keep doing.
t1_dtzo9wh	1	*	Well put x

t1_du03x0b	1	*	Thank you, I appreciate you :)
t1_dtzux3x	1	*	Just hunting alone contributes to a healthy ecosystem. Certain animal populations would be out of control without it and those animals would suffer greatly for it.
t1_dtzy15f	1	*	fair enough haha

t1_dtznl0b	0	*	leaks that reveal sources and methods can put those sources and methods at risk  otherwise fuck him gov should be as transparent as possible
t1_du02p9w	0	*	Dude go educate yourself. You do not need meat. 
t1_dtzjfqm	1	*	>  Is it illegal to make fake videos?  Yes, if you are accusing someone of misbehavior.  >and if it were, why should that make it illegal to make real videos?  It's not.
t1_dtzuipo	0	*	Believe it or not, plenty of people murder for money and power.
t1_dtzkuo4	1	*	Just use !redditsilver
t1_dtzq3r2	1	*	Humans eat meat as a larger part of their diet than ever before in history. Meat was eaten out of necessity.  It's no longer necessary. It's also not necessary to eat it in such ridiculous quantities.
t1_dtzqn2a	0	*	BACON THO
t1_dtzn94b	0	*	Well, in fact, they do. I am all against bullfights, but you came just wrong.

t1_dtzjdhp	0	*	Could also be used to track position of customers in stores, for example. Or how often they visit, how long they stay, ...
t1_du17vjd	0	*	So ethical diary exists so long as charity groups are hanging around to look after the animals the farmers are throwing away? How does that logic work. 
t1_dtzr596	0	*	My gf is a vegan, the smell of her food makes me sick.
t1_dtzop4r	0	*	Do you know what Nemesis means...?
t1_du10o07	0	*	It's not popular. As I've said, stop the lies and quit your fucking bullshit  It's legal because it moves a lot of money. As long as it's profitable politicians will allow it
t1_dtzt6x6	1	*	I can't really understand what you're trying to say.  There are plenty of intellectual arguments in response to vegetarians which I'm sure you're familiar with.
t1_dv4u2e3	0	*	Public transit is progression of society that's not really up for debate. 
t1_dtmxbz9	1	*	I don't understand it. I wouldn't want the government to be full of people who only support Democrats either. There's a reason why there are multiple parties, it helps keep things in check. 
t1_dt3tpb8	1	*	I like how level headed this is. Hoping we can all just debate without turning to flame wars more often.
t1_dt4v9nr	0	*	You are so upset only because you realised you can't come up with any counterexamples. 
t1_dt49fa6	0	*	I am comforted by the fact two people said this about the same time. 
t1_dt56it4	1	*	Saying people from a country are bad at things is RACISSSS
t1_dt59n2b	0	*	You do realize ROC raise to power only after overthrowing the Qing government,right? And Qing didn't exist before overthrowing the Ming dynasty... By your logic China never existed in history 
t1_dt48a9z	0	*	Gotta love that 80 pop capital with tech wonders and sitting next to a mountain.  Hitting modern error while other civs are playing with bows.
t1_dt3t4wg	1	*	I can agree with that, also think that the GOP is accelerating our decline in science.
t1_dt5ta87	1	*	Holy shit. The more I know about Trump, the less I think of the average intelligence of Americans for actually electing him. 
t1_dtet2k5	0	*	Lol, calm down non sequitur.. did u just learn what that meant? All he was saying was that doggies and trees are different.

t1_dtfpjw2	1	*	I mean, I love my dog, but I also eat beef.  It's not a huge stretch to me that somewhere else, somebody might feel the reverse.  It's not my culture, but I fail to see why it's wrong.
t1_dtndciq	0	*	Hey now.  I'm an expert on the IRS.   They're the group that keeps the foreign spies out.
t1_dtn8zs6	1	*	The sanctions. 
t1_dto5cbq	1	*	It's crazy that we have literal spies this day and age. Weird to think about. 
t1_dtngb0v	0	*	So a group of republicans paid for it first and then the DNC and Clinton funded it most of the way. Better?
t1_dtneumm	0	*	Racial quotas are not individual meritocracy. You understand that right? Being black is not a merit, you get that right?
t1_dtntwwb	1	*	There is a long list of reasons to sanction Russia. You should probably do a little reading on the country and the way theyre headed. That is, if you can even read.
t1_dtnmkhx	1	*	I think so to, but it certainly is more difficult to tell these days.

t1_dtxfhv8	1	*	Lutefisk is the same here. It's really only the older die hards that still eat it. 
t1_dtx8m2u	1	*	The most common thing is Minnesotans pronounce words like bag with a long A instead of a short A. The heacier accents that are stereotypical are usually restricted to older and more rural people.

t1_dsjtvq4	0	*	I love that Trumptards can't understand this distinction. 
t1_dsjza37	0	*	What?? His comment isn't offensive because they think African countries and Haiti are on par with Norway. Are you being purposefully obtuse?
t1_dsk4b1h	1	*	Guess who destabilised those countries...
t1_dskgmy9	1	*	No. I go for insults sometimes while correct.  When proven wrong I tend to apologize.   I haven't been proven wrong -here-.
t1_dsjy08t	1	*	Obama admitted that in the 1980s he would have been considered a moderate Republican. Now, he's a socialist, communist, Arab, Muslim Hitler from Kenya.

t1_dsjustc	1	*	Lol bro I never said ANY immigrants, just not many. Most come from Mexico, India, China, Philippines, and Canada. No European countries are even in the top ten of countries that immigrate here

t1_dsk1ym2	1	*	I didn't even notice the swear word. I think the problem is more that he said he didn't want Africans coming in, and wanted more people from place like Norway. That's way more than a little racist.
t1_dsk4sdi	1	*	> At least to American ears.  Ah, that might be it... cheers for explaining mate. I'm not hearing it though.
t1_dsk3hcd	1	*	I love this quote by Rachel Maddow:  I'm undoubtedly a liberal, which means that I'm in almost total agreement with the Eisenhower-era Republican party platform.

t1_dsjzjl0	1	*	What world are you living in?  
t1_dsjwq0n	1	*	That's true, but the same can be said for communes in Norway (albeit not as extreme). We could cherry pick California in the U.S or Bykle in Norway, but we're comparing country to country here.

t1_dsk2npu	1	*	Liberal?

t1_dsjwv1s	1	*	They got down to uh business once they got to America.
t1_dsjy8o6	1	*	So the POTUS only needs to worry about citizens who support him? I'm not American but that doesn't sound right.

t1_ds6f5ed	1	*	Thanks! I have read it, but its been awhile. Maybe a revisit is in order.   Edit to add, Homage to Catalonia is his nonfiction book about his time in the Spanish Civil War. Also a great read. 
t1_ds5ezi2	1	*	Ahh makes sense!
t1_ds5fvhf	1	*	TD think they're the apex trolls. they don't realize that the COS is trolling them better than they troll anyone just by existing.
t1_ds5f238	1	*	It's not like it directly benifited previous candidates/presidents either but they still did it.
t1_ds5jtx4	0	*	Its worked before - both Clinton and Obama had to spend their presidencies trying to repair (and getting blamed for) the damage that their republican predecessors had inflicted on the country.
t1_ds5irub	1	*	...as well as the lack of funds for social programs that will *have* to be cut back....or taxes raised - either way, the ones in charge when the bills come due will be fucked.
t1_ds5byke	1	*	I'm thinking something more along the lines of Sinclair taking over local news and warping it into something much worse.
t1_dtwfiar	0	*	The little green island couple with the big island
t1_dtekn0o	0	*	He wrote, signed his goddamn name, and printed it for the masses. That is all. 
t1_dsnprtn	0	*	google says a wolfhound can live 6 to 10 years, while the wolf only lives 5 to 6 years if it is lucky and avoids wolfhounds.
t1_dsnijft	1	*	Its like saying American and Canadian English are different languages.    They are identical to anyone who doesn't use the dialect and have a couple of minor differences.
t1_dsnlisn	0	*	Selenium!
t1_dsn9uxq	1	*	shit is this turning into a furry dnd campaign
t1_duxok7l	1	*	Oh yeah, it's there alright :(

t1_dt8qdyx	0	*	[ocean current maps shows it's possible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_current#/media/File:Corrientes-oceanicas.png)  but probably not likely I guess. 
t1_dsf2z0r	0	*	France looks after people with French nationality, irrespective of their ethnicity.  Israel looks after people with Israeli nationality AND Jewish ethnicity.  Does that make sense?
t1_dv2e9xm	1	*	China is also in good position thanks to Mao then
t1_duq92to	1	*	Trump is certainly a blue dog Democrat.

t1_du4n3jj	1	*	Again: Huh. TIL. Thanks! 
t1_dsaj5y5	0	*	Bullshit is when you claim China has the same toilet shortage problem as India does. Even Pakistan is better in that perspective
t1_dury0ui	1	*	tyvm, that would be nice!
t1_duns0s8	0	*	Of course a person could have thin skin and think that it's all about Trump or themselves, but that would be missing the point and kind of juvenile.
t1_du15ciw	1	*	That isn't how the law works, champ. Innocent until proven guilty.
t1_ds640sy	1	*	>No Canadian would ever say births shouldnt be covered!  Cool, neither did I.
t1_ds63tzj	1	*	Yeah, that doesn't follow at all from what I said. 
t1_duhu2wb	0	*	> asthma medicine isnt banned  Is it? There is a process how you can apply for a usage of certain substances. It's not like everybody can take these asthma medicines and pass doping tests.
t1_duivnvv	1	*	Yeah but PEDs are so small in curling vs games with more power or endurance required
t1_dt5v03a	0	*	> it's not a very good one  Don't beat yourself up too much, you'll do better next time.
t1_dslhsre	0	*	Extremely unnecessary scar tissue. 
t1_dsodrpe	1	*	That makes more sense.
t1_dsvk0oj	1	*	I'd probably get bored
t1_dswu538	1	*	You also need to remember that for thousands of years we literally didn't even believe humans could hunt an animal to extinction, let alone permanently harm the environment. 
t1_dt6g11p	0	*	That reads like most undergrad papers - you use many words to say very little.   Try stating your position plainly. Why was it a bad thing that the West transitioned from feudalism to capitalism?
t1_dswf2w4	1	*	Yeah like little robot dogs that shoot out tracking devices.

t1_dv3eb0w	0	*	Pedes means gay men in French, so Im constantly startled when I see this term in t_d context.
t1_dv7wrvk	0	*	A lot of ESLspeakers struggle on many of these points,awareness is a big step in conquering 'em.  I didn't even think about the passive (as a technical writer I fight with the passive voice too).
t1_dvcwe06	0	*	If would help if your links were most substantive than clickbait. And I'm dismissive because you largely undermine the causes you claim to support. 
t1_dv36dy0	0	*	I'm not sure if we're talking about the same thing, but I've dabbled in bots, and I needed a key to use the api.

t1_dv3w369	1	*	Of course... wasnt anywhere this good though 
t1_dv33dty	1	*	Id be very willing to use something like an ad blocker that could keep me from seeing fake news or alert me when something Im reading has a history of extreme bias or conspiracy theories. 
t1_dv36uuu	0	*	It's pretty much that actual racism is realism and equality is white genocide. In their minds they are equal. 
t1_dv3o5nj	1	*	>is
t1_dv3djzf	1	*	So there's bonus side-effects, nice
t1_dv3atsz	1	*	Good novelty account?
t1_dv3jyli	0	*	Hardly. Hillary's coverage didn't get much more favorable after the primary, it's just that there was a new target in Donald Trump. Even the Bernie or Busters could appreciate attacking him.
t1_dv36q6i	1	*	Oh yeah, I learned that quickly. You're basically deciding which side you want pissed off at you for petty reasons.
t1_dv3kthn	0	*	Certainly not. There are definitely bots spreading misinformation.  Real people do pick up on what bots say and perpetuate bullshit though.
t1_dv3bp8u	1	*	I made the comment expecting downvotes, but thanks anyways!
t1_dv3m4xy	0	*	Fascism is pretty distinctively right, politically.  There are definitely left authoritarians floating around the US now, but calling them fascists is incorrect. 
t1_dv3j8ab	0	*	I would bet my entire retirement account that I can guess up to 90% certainty on what will pass and who will be elected on a California ballot. 
t1_dv3hnvu	0	*	If it was after 2013 then no you were not subbed to politics.
t1_dv47jix	1	*	4chan pol board is a breeding ground for far right ideologies, all the people who I know who frequent 4chan ended up supporting far right ideologies after going on it daily.
t1_dv36gse	1	*	Depends on if it was in the post or an answer to someone asking how they can help.
t1_dv3d5sj	1	*	Plus no one on /pol/ would care if it turned out trollfarms were posting half their content. They'd probably be proud Russia thought they were worth paying attention to.
t1_dv3cjat	1	*	I'm not sure what you are asking.
t1_dv39rsf	0	*	Downvote for not using the proper usage.   It's wrigggity wreck yourself
t1_dv39xnx	0	*	TDK is left-wing to 90% of Americans. If you think it's centrist, you've got a perspective problem.
t1_dv3cl6q	1	*	I think the point is the extremism. Hate leads to violence, violence leads to murder. It's only a matter of time. One of these groups has just been at it a little longer. 
t1_dv4teb5	1	*	I really miss FPH. Voat's version has a shitload of racists. Can't help what race you are, folks... Ugh.

t1_dv37jw8	0	*	Literally an offshoot of /r/T_D. That's like saying /r/SRS is a valid source. 
t1_dv38ico	0	*	You clearly weren't there.  You're speaking in generalities with no firsthand experience.  You're wrong.  Move on.
t1_dv36wr8	1	*	Right yes totally. People disliked Hillary because she was an old woman. Okay.

t1_dv4f681	1	*	BUT  HER  EMAILS
t1_dv39yd8	1	*	I was young at the time but I followed the Clinton headlines. I never got the impression he was under serious threat of ouster. Johnson, on the other hand, survived only by a couple of votes.
t1_dv3ck9l	0	*	Have you looked at the information available? Yes, it is an unreasonable conclusion if you go back and read the kinds of posts that were happening in 2015.  Have you done that?
t1_dv3cbhk	0	*	Because of [these videos](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MKH6PAoUuD0)  Basically someone made MLG trump and sampled Centipede by Knife Party

t1_dv3hdy3	1	*	Thanks
t1_dv3b0ua	1	*	Oh and then T_D users will tell you Reddit has an inherentradical leftist(their idea if a radical leftist is a moderate progressive I shit you not) bias.
t1_dv387uu	1	*	Like most things they do, it was cringey, short-lived, and they came away thinking they won something while never wanting to speak about it again.
t1_dv38x1x	0	*	Lmfao did you actually take your own advice and look? It was the opposite and even he admitted it. 
t1_dv3btm2	1	*	From what I know there is a band called Knife Party that has a song called Centipede.  I dont know how it got from the song to what it is now.

t1_dv3c1hc	1	*	I just kind of say, Why would I be under investigation? and shrug really loudly. 
t1_dv46lbw	1	*	That's not an argument.  Whats the voting percent in completely blue or red states?
t1_dv396o9	0	*	Also T_D mods or power users or whoever then can start making the rounds in the press talking about censorship to young people with agendas and old dudes who have never seen one of them Reddits.
t1_dv37ena	1	*	Youve just gotta see the statistics on people who voted Obama in 2008 or 2012 but voted Trump in 2016 to know that.
t1_dv3fsei	1	*	If you're remotely centrist, you're an evil establishment shill in at least half of Reddit's eyes.

t1_dv3nx56	1	*	I thought it was weird that they were calling each other pedophiles, but they were Trump supporters so you know...
t1_dv38qj2	1	*	And judging by upvotes alone, there should be a lot of discussion in T_D but statistically there is not.
t1_dv4pqal	1	*	>all lives splatter  Oh my god... Trump supporters, these are the people you are agreeing with and supporting. I can't fucking believe that these people would support the murder of innocents. 
t1_dv3arh6	1	*	I always try to help them suss out a point from their ramblings. I want to know what they're thinking and why they're thinking it. It's just hard to even get to that understanding sometimes.
t1_dv4vxrx	1	*	My point is that time invested ratio to unique viewers, reddit is the far superior platform to manipulate and spread views on.

t1_dtrcb3f	1	*	Once someone left a giant shit on the floor of the women's bathroom in a Canadian Walmart i was shopping at. Walking into the stall and finding that log will haunt me forever.
t1_dtrfwrl	0	*	oh no! i have to **do things**, fuck that!
t1_dtrjjte	1	*	Assuming you only follow/like friends.  Add webpages, news sites, whatever crazy cat videos content you Like and the whole thing changes in character.
t1_dtsaai6	1	*	My brother thinks any post he sees in his News feed was posted on his wall.
t1_dtri4xc	1	*	I hope those appleheads are reading this.
t1_dtrfo0x	1	*	I too was once a Wal-Mart employee.
t1_dtri894	0	*	Why have different accounts? I don't really get it
t1_dtrgq6s	1	*	I think it's called Tinder
t1_dtrdah7	0	*	I'm just locked into facebook because it's how I keep in touch with all the people I've met in the last 15 years.
t1_dtrbg7y	1	*	I was first invited to join in late 2007 and it was opened at that time, as I did not have an .edu (the invite was sent to my yahoo e-mail).  So it was before then.
t1_dtrm8up	1	*	Exactly. My mom used to think the same thing, I've had to explain it to her over and over that it isn't the case. Still not sure if she gets it lol.
t1_dtrd50m	1	*	Yep, 2008 was when I started seeing a major decline in Myspace and the mass migration to FB. 
t1_dtrmhn8	1	*	Honestly I think if you stay away from the front-page then Reddit is fine. I only really post in 2-3 subreddits and dont feel like its that bad.
t1_dtrh4az	0	*	This one is. 
t1_dtrczev	0	*	Who the fuck hangs out at Walmart at any age?
t1_dtsbo94	0	*	Yeah but some people on reddit are more famous or popular. 
t1_dtrbh19	0	*	I like how you think you know everyone's friend's list and have manually gone through each and every single one to make sure that none breach 599 users.
t1_dtv7zwx	1	*	Lmao, I noticed youre a WSB participant. Up your DD for higher returns. You might even get a job in asset management like me if youre able to produce alpha. 
t1_dtra9ul	1	*	*^'eddit ^^eddit ^^^eddit*
t1_dtrd980	1	*	Snapseed is on iOS too btw
t1_dtrcavo	0	*	I think the problem arises because every image to every post has to be epic now that gets likes.. Posting something stupid or just for fun and having no likes is almost insulting. 
t1_dtrx4c6	1	*	Damn, thanks for responding anyway. This is my #1 pet peeve with FB and the reason I don't interact with public posts very often. 
t1_dtrhbmh	1	*	I will try telegram. If only to support the little guy.
t1_dts84cz	1	*	Thats what I mean by newcomers.  A lot of us have been on the internet for ages, and a lot of people only bought a computer for facebook in the last decade.  Its a cultural difference 
t1_dts0w8d	1	*	That joke should've died a long time ago, but to you it might as well be.
t1_dtrernr	1	*	Good point. Growing up rural, Wal-Mart was only 20 min away in a few different directions. Before Wal-Marts boomed in our area, a drive to the nearest city was 2 hours. 
t1_dtrlyqv	1	*	That's not how this works.  That's not how *any of this* works.
t1_dtrgey7	1	*	That example seems personal.
t1_dtrdwt1	0	*	Get Discord then, although it's already on its way downhill, too.
t1_dsmejhd	0	*	Isn't following the legal requirements all that's needed? And if they aren't sufficient to filter out the bad guys and let in the good ones, we need to update them.
t1_dsj1jta	0	*	Couldn't tell, i dont smoke, but i know i want a Steak now and itsxb4s your fault.
t1_dt3ixk1	1	*	If as a consumer you purchase *any* product that employs solar powered technology or that is produced through a reliance on solar power, then you will in fact be paying those taxes.
t1_dui4qi0	0	*	Usually about 4-5 %, so pretty weak but not incredibly so.
t1_duj003t	1	*	Drinking from their nasty cup with no straw, no thanks  Edit: I would totally carry my own straw everywhere, problem solved.
t1_durifl0	1	*	It's complicated, read a book by an economists(someone with a PHD in economics) who specialize in foreign trade.  I could try to explain it to you but I couldn't do it justice 
t1_dut3oy2	1	*	He's a conspiracy theorist because he's educated? Everything he said was right historically.
t1_duzdjro	1	*	Didn't it turn out to be Rove, and not a thing happened except that he retired a long while later and is now a talking head on Fox News?
t1_duef5i6	1	*	lol
t1_dubn4cu	1	*	Russia sanctions, voting reform, cyber security instead of fucking bullshit payouts to the millitary-industrial complex, etc. Of course a republican congress puts a damper on things.
t1_ducu9mu	1	*	Beep bop
t1_dubquy8	1	*	The sanctions that Trump hasn't implemented, you mean? The ones the GOP are ignoring now?  
t1_dubpcsx	1	*	Yeah I guess some of them are. But not all? They do have some Spanish roots or something like that. Makes sense lol 
t1_duc3muc	1	*	I thought that was what the tension was all about, why everyone cared about Syria. I am so confused 
t1_dubgjb0	0	*	all being you're going to cite koi and then just fiercely deny reality for the rest.
t1_dubwbg0	1	*	Adding fuel to the fire I see
t1_dub9nnt	1	*	He actually nails it. There's a lot less crime in the cities and a lot more guns in the country. This has nothing to do with population density.  Greetings from the Netherlands
t1_dubniva	0	*	Not all opinions are equal.
t1_duboo7l	0	*	If you think it was only one side with fake news you just enjoyed the fake news targeted at you. Both parties embrace the practice. Shills for every side. 
t1_duc7pkv	1	*	So you want to take away the rights of someone because you don't like who they voted for. Russia must be *really* proud of you.
t1_dubrewg	1	*	But the OP is about Russian trolls   As for 3 not just copying broken links?  As for the university of Phoenix online...nuff said
t1_dubxlpx	1	*	all you need to do is browse funny or aww and you see the bots that repost for karma.   At least I hope they're bots, that or just losers who repost hundreds of times a month
t1_dubzrcv	0	*	> you come off as an edgy 14 year old.  Oh sorry, I was sitting here thinking NRA=ISIS was a very mature and logical metaphor.
t1_ducj7c7	0	*	You're against judging people because of their skin colour, why judge people because of benign beliefs?
t1_dubphqi	1	*	Exactly....wait.
t1_dubp2q7	1	*	He can pass sanctions that were already approved by Congress and Senate tho.
t1_duc91ra	0	*	Why isn't this person telling me what to think like Fox and Friends! (My fav)
t1_dubo3pw	0	*	So why is only one side being attacked?
t1_dublx02	1	*	they always defend it its just dark humor bro, its a way to *cope* as if they went through the tragedy themself.
t1_ducoqgn	0	*	You have no idea what you are talking about.
t1_duccn7x	1	*	Idk what would make me believe it, is WikiLeaks still active?
t1_dubia9d	1	*	And its the number of man. But we were simple factory workers and hell shift had a nice ring to it. 
t1_duc340n	0	*	except no, I know most of those sites and I can tell you those links are academic papers (except the twitter and news links).
t1_duboz07	1	*	yikes yks/Submit exclamationinformal expressing shock and alarm,   This alarms and shocks you? Ridiculous.
t1_dsx081o	1	*	 It's already the currency.
t1_dsmsr10	1	*	Wow, if you've not run into anyone who likes living in Hull you must have kept a low profile this last year.  
t1_dsn5p34	0	*	I agree but I don't think its a bad deal tbh. If this gets the ball rolling I'm all for it.
t1_dtkuqre	0	*	And what makes you think he is wrong? 
t1_dtlkgbj	1	*	nah its the late night 69's braw cook
t1_dtkx325	0	*	Once prices rise high enough, supply *will* meet demand.
t1_dtl58g7	1	*	China is very good at keeping things under wraps.
t1_dtkxbp7	0	*	In what field?
t1_dtl79pn	1	*	Hence why Elon is selling flamethrowers. He knows whats coming
t1_dtlcs8d	1	*	Doctors have been massively over prescribing antibiotics for decades now.  They think they know wtf they're doing, but apparently a SHITLOAD of them have no goddamn clue.  
t1_dtl3zi1	1	*	... ... ... relevant username ?
t1_dtl603g	0	*	Jokes on you, Im too poor to avoid meat anyway. HAH
t1_dtkx8jj	1	*	There are plenty of biotech companies that make GM crops. DuPont, Bayer, Dow, Syngenta, etc. It's not a monopoly.
t1_dtkmyiz	0	*	It was pretty easy since I dont have a leg in this conversation. Just wanted to point out the inconsistencies. 
t1_dtl6ia6	1	*	And the dutch!
t1_dtl4gmz	1	*	True. I meant more sort of, made of baking soda.
t1_dtky62u	0	*	Not in all countries. Afaik its illegal at least in Finland to use antibiotics preemptively, as routine or for anything other than treating individual animals.
t1_dtl80kb	1	*	I'm literally eating McDonalds right now.
t1_dtl1pi6	1	*	This particular thread is about China
t1_dtl6iwl	1	*	Pretty much
t1_dtmyur5	0	*	Yup, it's not going to be easy. But don't take the responsibility off of yourself. Eating less meat is the single best thing you can do for the environment. Better than not driving a car.
t1_dtldg2a	0	*	Very much depends on what is causing zombies, but my money's on virus or prion, so you're probably right.
t1_dtl11bp	1	*	Have you got a source for that? I always had the impression that the fitness cost of antibiotic resistance was small in most cases.
t1_dtkubow	1	*	Through experience?
t1_dtl2ubp	0	*	I don't buy meat
t1_dtkyjdn	1	*	Some bacteria have seen that resistance go away in a matter of weeks even. 
t1_dthebxt	1	*	In a DDOS attack, the distributed part refers to the supply being non-centralized (coming from multiple locations). So you're right, it's sort of DDOS, but not for the reason you say.
t1_dti55ug	0	*	Tell that to the royal party. Or the Bolsheviks. 
t1_dthih3s	1	*	It's a fun and scary place to visit, reaffirming how utterly motherfucking stupid, ignorant, and vile human beings can be.
t1_dthcpkb	0	*	>if your goal is to silence opposing views, you are a fascists.   Who is silencing opposing views apart from Fox and the White House? 
t1_dthjyyz	1	*	[Plenty of fake news sources for you to read through.](https://www.google.com/search?q=steele+dossier+corroborated&oq=steele+dossier+corr&aqs=chrome.0.0j69i57j0.7455j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8)
t1_dthrrvg	1	*	Kind of like unicorns... have not seen one of those in a while.
t1_dth2sfy	0	*	Yeah it seems something the conservatives would care about, not the progressives. Though it could of course be a strategy to *make* the conservatives care, which still makes it highly hypocritical.  
t1_dthhtp4	1	*	Lol you probably aren't even fucking old enough to vote. This post is just a hodgepodge of troll bait shit, just like your other post.
t1_dthfexl	0	*	Provide evidence it's real and factual, the burden of proof is on you not anybody else
t1_dthekok	1	*	It's still real to me, dammit!
t1_dtheyyq	0	*	Don't forget that Patton Oswalt's new wife (Meredith Salenger) as Deputy Sharon Gare!
t1_dthgvul	1	*	*You've become a moderator of /r/TopMindsOfReddit*   Gotta say you sound crazier than most people on /r/conspiracy. You think im an insane racist cultist and that makes *me* crazy?
t1_dtjoosy	1	*	Sorry guys. I hoped that claim was over the top absurd enough to sound intentionally fucked, but I probably overestimate both humanity and the internet. 
t1_dtkui3z	0	*	Yes, however physics has more uses. I believe you might be familiar with people claiming allergies to wi-fi for instance.   And physics is a broad term, thats part of the point.
t1_dthk1w0	1	*	If he gets fired he loses his retirement money. 
t1_dthdhio	1	*	I love reading your posts.  I hope to FSM you aren't a Russian playing the other end of the fiddle.  I'm eating this shit up.
t1_dthagra	0	*	Both of his daughters, actually. Tiffany just didn't get the fake tits he wanted.
t1_dthc04b	1	*	So, again, what's this have to do with trump and the Russia collusion. It's an entirely different case. Stop trying to change the subject. 
t1_dthhz9n	1	*	I'm just sittin' here relieved I'm not the only who makes that slip of the tongue.  *holds up bowl in true story fashion*
t1_dthdytn	1	*	Cowards have to hide behind dog-whistles though.
t1_dthirc0	1	*	>Its a bunch of tabloid BS to distracy from the very real evidence coming out from Peter Strzok and others at the FBI.  You mean his affair?
t1_dthja71	1	*	I thought you said microscopenis?   lol my bad.
t1_dthexxd	0	*	Are you trying to say all 30,000 employees of the FBI aren't the same? Who knew?
t1_dtih0at	1	*	Yeah, he should apologize for that.
t1_dthbzrf	1	*	Apparently I did, as I am a straight-laced male between the ages of 21 and 65. /s
t1_dthdt53	1	*	Well while they had her they just double checked if she floated, like a witch. 
t1_dth9pnh	1	*	...Then why are you here?
t1_dthlj4q	1	*	Yes I'm sure he loves being attacked daily in the news with claims of how he's destroying America.
t1_dti6qdk	1	*	k. thanks for your insightful thoughts containing literally no substantiate information whatsoever.  Your comment really swayed me. 
t1_dthh1mi	0	*	you got him this time for sure!
t1_dth97lw	1	*	Ya but if the baker down the street doesn't want you to know he likes tacos, and the taco truck guy knows this, he could potentially blackmail the baker into doing disgusting things to your bread.
t1_dthmuun	0	*	From my point of view it is the F.B.I. who are evil!
t1_dthggft	0	*	No its not.    Starving Siberian children are not worth your petty revenge.  
t1_dth7qcs	1	*	Hey hey now, don't try to reason with it. It does not accept such form of thought. 
t1_dthledw	0	*	Well I guess they didnt want her enough lmao
t1_dthroer	0	*	I do find it hilarious that Americans never question the idea that tax cuts are a good thing. Or investigate exactly who got most of the tax cut...
t1_dtgyim4	1	*	Uh huh, and it seems that the sanctions that were voted on have not been imposed.  Those must have been some mighty fine adoption talks in Trump Tower.
t1_dthlltp	0	*	Ok, so reading more about it Steele first handed this to the FBI in October. So now its even less credible because its from the same guy who brought them BS the last time. 
t1_dtih5w7	0	*	But still russians managed to do more harm than nazis.
t1_dtijpd3	0	*	Paul Stamets?
t1_dthaye3	0	*	You find all the evidence necessary to charge, and then you do it. If Mueller hasn't charged Trump yet, its because he doesn't have enough evidence.
t1_dth7xjh	0	*	Take about an hour out to read through u/PoppinKREAM 's comments, they're sourced, cited and very well written. 
t1_dthqdnm	1	*	It's okay because obviously everyone read between the lines and thought critically about why the author wanted to tell you that story. /S
t1_dthl65e	1	*	Oops, I didnt say /s  Please dont send me into oblivion :p
t1_dthhn38	0	*	Women vote too. I've been in North Carolina and heard an overweight woman refer to someone as a snowflake. Please stop trying to focus blame based on gender or race. It sets us all back. 
t1_dthk5fg	1	*	Isn't it the purpose of a joke to be funny?
t1_dthxlis	0	*	Yeah the people above you are having a serious critical thinking problem.   Democracy MUST be the way so that must mean a (insert number of parties here) party system MUST be FLAWED!!  
t1_dtiuamr	1	*	What agenda? I'm pretty anti everyone. I didn't trust the news long before these alt right idiots cried fake news. That doesn't mean stories are all fake. 
t1_dti1yo1	1	*	So youre suggesting he should be put on trial to determine his guilt or innocence, right?
t1_dt1ptlf	0	*	Steroids is the dirty secret in body building.   I'm talking about sustainable agriculture. Again how do vegans solve peak phosphorous? 
t1_du1jysr	1	*	You have to thoroughly compost it first, don't put shit straight on the fields.
t1_dswmgsz	1	*	All I did was respond to your comment, I wasnt claiming anything. 
t1_dsxi6nt	1	*	Can't trust Chinese sources all propaganda, also can't trust American sources that disagree with you lul
t1_dss46o2	0	*	Nice! A witty way to avoid original point.
t1_dssu0yv	0	*	That's funny, because my mother left the country in the 80's, when China was even more strict I assume, and didn't need a letter to leave. 
t1_dv0hks3	0	*	You can take pinyin from my .
t1_dv0hgo2	0	*	*ahem*   What do you mean by the soviet union being right wing? Isn't socialism left wing innately? 
t1_dv0z8xo	1	*	Middle East seems to have a fun time exploiting itself.
t1_dtbgabr	1	*	Lol,damn, the level of self obsession in you have... You probably think you are the alpha male or something.geez. you won, say hi to your triple chin for me btw
t1_ds75dk4	1	*	As if every law has to be implicitly enforced under all circumstances. Some laws ensure rights, some duties.
t1_dsmrbs1	0	*	Wrong.  >Estimated 513,000 girls and women in the United States were *either* victims of FGM or at risk of FGM, with  under age 18.  http://www.prb.org/Publications/Articles/2015/us-fgmc.aspx  
t1_dsjkxus	0	*	I didn't say all this was gonna happen tomorrow. Nor in the next 50 years. But if trends aren't reversed we may find ourselves in the midst of a new Great Dying.
t1_ds2w0e6	0	*	Did Cubans have the nukes? I thought the nukes got stopped before they arrived...  Also, China isn't Cuba, a slow starvation is not preferrable to a quick exctinction.
t1_duvt3bt	1	*	Don't bite the newb.
t1_dtaqlmy	1	*	Again I see reference to a story that may indeed be true, but does not actually support the claim that WikiLeaks works for Russia or that WikiLeaks received its recent material from Russian hackers.  
t1_dssseia	1	*	My point is that the EU isn't particularly dependent on the UK.  It's just another market.
t1_dtgtzu3	0	*	They're a little busy with Jews and steel beams to pay attention to this shit.
t1_dth8esp	1	*	Sure thing!  Thank you for the kind reply and for reading my overly-long-winded post.
t1_dtgp1sf	1	*	I would say everything about this presidency is making me question my sanity, and the sanity of the country, if that counts
t1_dtglqyu	0	*	But Frosted Flakes are grrrreat!
t1_dtgk5mz	0	*	Just for clarification. Did Obama veto it, or did he sign the bill but not execute it?
t1_dtgl5av	1	*	>What do I care if the world burns if I make 2% more per year  FTFY 
t1_dtgaf84	0	*	 He's just a Russian troll desperate to try to spend the both sides are equal argument.  But he's not paid enough to do that kind of work.
t1_dtgnn1y	1	*	[Remember that time when Republicans were ready to impeach Obama for wearing tan suit?](https://dawm7kda6y2v0.cloudfront.net/uploads/2014/08/ogmr5kkzxhafxyfxqro2-1024x664-d41d8cd.jpg)
t1_dtgis2t	1	*	So.... your system is flawed? 
t1_dtgxnol	1	*	Sooo, no backsies? 
t1_dth3c8i	1	*	That honestly just sounds like something dump trump supporters made up to explain why he is always stuffing his face with Big Macs and fries.
t1_dtghv61	0	*	So the system is set up to fuck you over, and if you try and complain about it in any meaningful way you'll be ruined. Good system.
t1_dtgo5o4	1	*	honestly they might not be a Russian tbh, trump voters are notorious for voting against their own odds, maybe they like being subjugated by a threatening Russia
t1_dtgm1ad	1	*	That's not a crisis.  The branches of govt don't disagree that Congress can impeach, the exec branch hasn't prevented them from exercising that power.
t1_dtiktb4	0	*	Hardly a reason to let them leave their nose up our business. It's certainly no reason to let them have influence over Europe, especially when the Eastern part is done being under their thumb.
t1_dtgo84n	0	*	Oh well if they have a fatwa I guess theres nothing to worry about. Never in history has one of those been reversed. Theyre iron clad in their consistency. 
t1_dtgp60c	1	*	 Do you want pics of that interview where he admits that? I have them.
t1_dtghhfg	0	*	Kek
t1_dtgnjl1	1	*	The WH never said that, though you may be misconstruing the original objections to the Bill (which appear legitimate).
t1_dtirvbz	0	*	Maybe if you were more serious about these topics, instead of treating them sarcastically and as a matter of pride for yourself, you'd see some of the trends going on for yourself.
t1_dth5cle	0	*	There are many reasons for his electoral win. He won a few counties that carried him honestly. Dude have you not been paying attention at all
t1_dtgnzax	0	*	Fuck evangelicals! Fuck every fucking thing about them!
t1_dth73fd	0	*	Why are you disagreeing with my statement that we need to do something about it then?
t1_dtgithf	1	*	No?
t1_dtgfml7	0	*	Here's the crazy thing though, and I'm not sure if you know this, but... Hillary Clinton isn't the president.
t1_dtgmm10	0	*	Is this Trumps account from 2014?
t1_dtg7bk3	0	*	Are you fucking kidding me? Lol I say to pull your head out of your asses and this is what you come up with? Am I even American? 
t1_dtgqtxo	1	*	And because she isn't we need to waste all these resources parsing out how it was stolen from her.  *yawn

t1_dtgvoo5	0	*	answer both the questions
t1_dtii90q	1	*	It's just allegations though, completely unproven. Everything you've said is devoid of meaning.
t1_dtgr8dy	0	*	The statute only provides a mechanism for releasing sanctions once imposed on individual people or entities.  That was not done.
t1_duf77cs	1	*	Mmmmmm rare kangaroo
t1_duex7i8	0	*	Like normal bodybuilders arent shooting themselves us with testosterone.
t1_duq0y9n	0	*	The world agreed after WWII that acquisition of territory by force was against the law. That was determined at Nuremberg, in response to hitlers aggression. So, Israel missed the boat. 
t1_dtaau1l	1	*	It's one of those things that will make you become suddenly extremely skilled at pretending you are literally **anywhere else**. hahaha
t1_dtzlx6w	1	*	Most black families I knew had pictures of Obama which is understandable. Never seen any bush pictures

t1_dtxtlk0	1	*	It's in the capable hands of the Hawaii PIs that got Trump Obama's birth certificate.

t1_dtypgg0	0	*	Well everyone is CIA aren't they.

t1_dtyjuwz	0	*	Ive seen people with the entire Obama family on their wall
t1_dtyqp0v	0	*	I think it will depend on the full back story of how he got selected for Veep.  I mean, it was obviously to appease the Republican establishment but why him in particular.
t1_duaa0cv	1	*	Ah, I see...that's understandable, I suppose. 
t1_dsv5c1l	1	*	you mean like a lobotomy?... yeah. same page.

t1_dt56gfa	1	*	I say that because it obviously is hard to decipher the meaning, which is the point of grammar. Not fussy rule following.
t1_dt4qhy4	1	*	As of the last few months, yes.
t1_dtsqs3e	0	*	Interesting. I like a lot of what he has to say. Though, I'm not sure how cutting corporate taxes by 5% and cutting our own taxes at the same time would help clear the deficit. 
t1_dtw3oc8	1	*	No problem. 
t1_dtvuibs	1	*	Yeah, my friend has stayed at the company I started working at for 3 years without getting a raise. and I found out that this company hasn't increased it's entry level pay in more than 10 years.
t1_dtvvmy4	0	*	By doing what exactly?
t1_dtvwlsv	0	*	Ot is more efficient for the company, but it isn't good for the work force at large.  By that, it's not good for the employment statistics of that country.  More ot means less people employed.  
t1_dtvumlr	1	*	There's a chance! Also might believe that your pristine culture is being destroyed by immigrants. 
t1_dtvz4bz	0	*	Yes.  That is the assumption.  There obviously is an inflection point where it's more cost effective to hire a new employee.  But that is a fixed cost investment.
t1_dtvvlot	1	*	My experience was comparable. We were doing 5 week shifts at a remote radar base. 12 to 14 hours every day of the week, but there wasn't anything else to do or anywhere to go so it was okay.
t1_dtw6n1r	0	*	Yeah, just depends on the project though. Sometimes 8-5 is enough, sometimes is later plus weekends. 
t1_dtw0qiz	0	*	My experience is that I'd rather work 16 hours a day and have 1 day off a week. Especially if it's for more than a few weeks at a time. I need my me day.
t1_dtw19os	1	*	Yeah okay it's actually the same in Sweden. Government has no saying in this, there's no law for minimun wage and not all work places have union contract.
t1_dty6mcn	1	*	I'd consider myself poor, yes. What's your point? Let's put aside cost of living then. About the same percentage of Germans are in poverty as Americans (~13%). 
t1_dtvzn56	1	*	I know. I just like to push these young people who don't understand anything about the world. If I can make just one person critically think about ignorant statements like this I'm happy. 
t1_dubz0yh	0	*	Presumably you mean junction boxes.
t1_dtdqy2q	1	*	Here's my thumbs up to you.

t1_dtd43ba	1	*	Damn man, sorry you had to go through that

t1_dtzjy4i	0	*	Heterosexuality is normal. Equating normal to good and abnormal to bad is just wrong.
t1_dtzib3q	0	*	> Well thanks for the insightful debate.   Why do Christians feel so entitled to debate over their rabid acceptance of things that they made up? It's the weirdest thing.
t1_dtzm5s8	0	*	The idiocy you show astounds me.
t1_du0oc8p	1	*	Just look at Mike Pence.

t1_duri92m	1	*	GBS is treatable too, so those 325 people have a better prognosis than the people who die from the flu as those deaths often come without much warning (other than just having the flu). 
t1_duhcu1a	0	*	It won't be suicides because of leaving the EU directly, it will be because of an increase in people living on or below the poverty line. 
t1_ds8qy6c	1	*	I already have it :) Tubbs is a beast!
t1_ds2hg11	0	*	Missile defense is about layering, especially in the face of a saturation attack.  The loss of any point defense is a higher chance of receiving a hit from an incoming missile.

t1_dsbbrbn	0	*	YES. AND WHILE THEY ARE IN JAIL MAYBE THEY CAN REFLECT ON WHAt they have done. 
t1_dsd5ua5	0	*	You have weird anger issues surrounding women.
t1_du9iz3z	1	*	China executes several thousand people a year, with a far less fair legal system. There is absolutely no comparison. 
t1_du9ctit	1	*	Dude, just stop lying man. You havent lived in China before. If you do and still have this view, then you are hanging with a very weird crowd. 
t1_dua4qdy	1	*	Sure bud ;)
t1_du9iq2i	0	*	dude. you can get arrested and thrown in prison for talking about a coupe in the US and any other country on earth. What are you smoking?
t1_du92rt0	1	*	Where all choices are equal, but some more equal than others.
t1_du6k8kp	0	*	You mean the same Syrian government that was killing protesters before this all started? Yeah let's ask their permission.
t1_du6zi6y	1	*	Sure, I agree. And they'd claim it was a humanitarian nuke just like the last time.
t1_du79898	1	*	I know that, it is why I am talking recent history. Soviets had soldiers in Vietnam and Korea killing US soldiers, and before WWII US service people were helping the Chinese against the Japanese. 
t1_du6vz8o	0	*	Nobody had nukes, countries  weren't so interdependent.
t1_du70ur4	1	*	I don't think that the US tries to topple Assad. It honestly didn't even cross my mind. If they thought it was in their best interest they would have done it long before the Russians were involved.
t1_du6njsi	0	*	So you're saying people that wage conflict on civilians deserve to be attacked & don't get to hid behind any veneer serving as a justification for their actions?
t1_du6jvxl	1	*	Obviously. So why would they stop calling themselves Russians?
t1_du71bgj	0	*	Not really U.S controlled.  It's controlled by a militia that is U.S backed. It's like saying everything the Syrian Army controls is Russian controlled.  
t1_du7kdig	1	*	Legit though, you are being a ragged cunt
t1_du6upi3	1	*	It *absolutely* is whataboutism. His comment does not in any way connect to military actions in Syria. It is only aimed at police actions with no context in the general conversation.
t1_du73xji	1	*	If we define it by wikipedia then Blackwater isn't mercenary and it's in fact withing US and international anti-mercenary laws.
t1_du6kuk0	1	*	Brought to you inclusively RT news 
t1_du7242s	1	*	Some consequences are felt more slowly and subtly than others, but in the long run nothing is without consequence.
t1_du740id	1	*	I think we can agree that w/e the reason was [They chose,poorly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ubw5N8iVDHI)
t1_du6wp6b	0	*	That isn't the case at all.  And it's kind of scary that you believe that. 
t1_du6jief	0	*	Oh come on. Fighting ISIS = bombing a country because you don't like them?
t1_du7euzk	1	*	I ain't no La-Li-Lu-Le-Lo
t1_du6tey5	0	*	Using Willie Pete is ok but we draw the line at Zarin?
t1_du6ow5a	0	*	Don't you mean: Russia with it's veto power on the UN security....
t1_du71trc	0	*	ask the crazy neocons running shit in the trump admin, they will probably say some bs about iran being a terror funder and threat to global peace
t1_du8cd6k	0	*	You'd better show some love for that F-15.  I've seen them take off and go vertical until you couldn't see them any more.  Impressive in their own right.
t1_dsj19rm	0	*	Again, your say-so is utterly meaningless.
t1_duk2p9y	0	*	its too bad you have to deal with our country as a whole, and not individual states..
t1_dul9ic7	0	*	Agree.  Like I said earlier, they are more polite about it now, but let there be no doubt about who is carrying the BIG STICK even though they may be speaking softly.
t1_durhsex	1	*	Nah
t1_duyejon	1	*	Yea obviously but well... she supported the regime when it initially got in power and she should have expected this sooner than later. 
t1_dsnh8qo	0	*	Stop speaking before you embarrass your country further. I like a bunch of Americans, and you smearing their name with your disgraceful trolling attempt is deeply unfortunate to watch.
t1_dso3p09	0	*	Again, it certainly can't be your fault, your problem. Deflect the blame some more. Make it someone else's fault or responsibility. Because then nothing will have to change. 
t1_dsniklq	1	*	What kind of message does it send to the world when your president lies to the entire world to start an illegal invasion?
t1_dsnli1o	0	*	Maybe your government shouldn't torture 15 year old's.
t1_dsns2e0	1	*	Germany almost did it in ww2 had it not been for the US nuking Japan and the Russians stepping in.
t1_dt8d1ha	1	*	It wouldn't matter if even if he was in office. Being an elected official doesn't bar a person from having an opinion and expressing it. 
t1_dtfeanr	1	*	I have no clue of icehockey xD In the news they just talked about ice hockey players... no idea which ones thogh. Bad example from my side.
t1_dtvtne0	1	*	It is still different job.

t1_dt42o0n	0	*	So dont get involved in matters that dont concern you and you have limited knowledge about? Like Crimea?
t1_dt4ek4o	0	*	The US didnt annex it unlike what Russia is doing on its borders.
t1_dt4rra0	1	*	Exactly. Whatever happens, I'm covered.

t1_dti8mjz	0	*	You use it. I'm asking HOW you would use it.  Stopping propaganda? You said no to that so.. what?
t1_dthswm7	0	*	Or misattribution. 
t1_dtgrwia	1	*	Hillary really wasn't so bad though, the point I am making is they were voting with their opinion rather than what is best for the country
t1_dtgufm8	0	*	Wait till the blowback comes for you rural self righteous conservatives the worm will turn and soon enough you will have made your bed to sleep in it. 
t1_dtg2mer	0	*	Oh, I didnt realize you were a troll. No point arguing this. Anyone with access to twitter can see his tweets. 
t1_dtgrpzw	1	*	Sounds accurate
t1_dthcwty	1	*	'MURICA
t1_duuxrtu	0	*	This is tone trolling, and it is often used to discredit a position without engaging with it. Like this.
t1_duw7urh	1	*	It's fact, weather the downvotes.
t1_dt9y25z	0	*	What law has he broken thats being obstructed from justice? We are 2 years into this shit now and they have nothing.
t1_dsmwrs7	0	*	hahaha, see how you didn't answer that question, take that as a yes. anyway never said russia's fault, i said they blame each other.
t1_dst5y5x	0	*	Are you sure? What is the difference?
t1_duw2o5w	1	*	Okay, man.
t1_duw4734	1	*	It was the first result on my quick google. [How about NPR?](https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2012/10/18/163034053/top-five-myths-of-genetically-modified-seeds-busted)

t1_dsxrndb	0	*	The Chicken Fillet.
t1_dt53exs	1	*	Exactly. The good that we see here in her heart is something to be celebrated. I just hope she is truly sincere in it and not doing it for popularity sake.
t1_dt4s90t	0	*	hate and anger didn't shoot the gun, the 15 yr old kid did.
t1_dtx5ycw	1	*	And supplied food to those starving before we ever even entered militarily. 
t1_dtx5vnv	1	*	You do realize that the tariffs came after a unanimous decision by 3:1 D:R trade board?   (and that the only one Trump's appointed was a Dem)
t1_dtx59uk	1	*	Different people.  I voted for Gary Johnson who ran on a non-interventionist platform.
t1_dtwqzel	1	*	He would rather they invade each other, while not signing up for the military himself. It is a common trend, sadly.
t1_dtwecd0	0	*	How is that even related to the topic at hand. Which US companies couldn't sell what panels where exactly, and what does that have to do with the tariffs the EU imposed on panels made in China?
t1_dtwptg3	0	*	Military bases and troop deployments abroad 
t1_dtwl9as	1	*	Because a certain segment of the population supports us being less militarily involved in other countries but still being able to defend ourselves.
t1_ds5iuec	0	*	I thought that was always the case with police searches? I mean if cops come into your house looking for -illegal whatever- and they see a mound of weed in the corner they're not gonna just ignore it.

t1_dt1uzy8	1	*	I roll mine for about $1.32/pack. That's $13.20 a cartoon.
t1_dt1sycf	1	*	Pretty sure they dont count a child or a retired person when determining the average wage in America. 
t1_dt2athp	1	*	I have a Bulgarian friend and even on ~$400/mo she had her own apartment and lived relatively comfortably.
t1_dt219u2	1	*	Seriously, I'd *start* smoking if I could find them that cheap. 
t1_dt25uom	1	*	It's often easier to get a new job than acquiring new capital. Also, you gain skills when you work. Truck drivers that own their own truck are very similar to investors that invest their capital. 
t1_dt21bg5	1	*	Life in the cities is pretty equivalent. Most people have a 10 year old car, apartment and a cheap smart phone?
t1_dt1s1zx	1	*	Ok, i think the same way with you actually... Was just asking because some people wud still hate them even if they pay the fair share simply because they are too rich. 
t1_dt1zw22	0	*	You should run for office. You would be wildly popular then be eaten up by nonsensical politics.  On second thought, maybe not...
t1_dt1tczd	0	*	Great one. I am not Chinese. Do you want to add something to the conversation? 
t1_dt22oqr	0	*	A month's salary is a big deal for Bezos
t1_dt2v1gl	0	*	Yes. This is why I'm for a system that would get rid of Capital Accumulation.   https://www.economicshelp.org/blog/glossary/capital-accumulation/
t1_dt1w3ev	1	*	I think he's using the 10,000 multiplier as well? Which means he's implying that he earns 20,000 per month.
t1_dt29vnv	0	*	If houses are going for 400k, it's not even almost an extremely expensive place to live. 
t1_dt2ipg7	0	*	Try imagining a place. 
t1_dt1robt	0	*	Tell me what Jeff Bezos has stolen from you.  How about Larry Page? Sergei Brin?   When did Larry Ellison every steal from you?
t1_dt1ullx	1	*	Hahahaha holy shit where do you live that you can get by for 20 years on $15k per year?
t1_dt35ej9	1	*	No that's a silly idea. Why would you even suggest that?
t1_dt1syss	0	*	Isn't that the same thing?

t1_dsh0vzb	0	*	And then Pakistan sold the technology to North Korea
t1_dsgpliq	1	*	Or how about the full extent of modern US imperialism and the human rights violations of our govt agencies and their collaborators?
t1_dujm79x	1	*	The joke will continue being relevant as long as Trump and his followers continue behaving as they are.
t1_dujmiox	1	*	Yes.  Everyone from Ivanka to Eric, with suggested running years and all.
t1_dukgnmu	1	*	Oh you must be unaware, but according to these revisionist nutjobs, the war in Iraq was actually a liberal democrat conspiracy. 
t1_dsmfwb0	1	*	Don't ask about the Clintons stealing billions... another wake up call.
t1_dslg0i2	0	*	Is DR a shithole too?
t1_dsm3ikg	1	*	Yes i know, there are other types of refugees. My point is once the reason they came here is gone, they should go back. I dont see how thats an unreasonable position.
t1_dsktjqn	0	*	True, but both were pretty foul mouthed dudes. 
t1_dsjedcm	0	*	Yeah, well, that's just, like, your opinion man.  
t1_dugt5rb	1	*	Same, i was in Baghdad back in 2011 for work and to visit my uncles and aunts.  Had a very good time in Baghdad and Erbil
t1_dugmrhi	0	*	Someone disagrees with you, so they must be an idiot? Grow up. You are not the worlds moral compass.

t1_ds5vwit	0	*	A handful of protesters who were unfortunately killed due to their violent aggressions somehow enables you to speak on behalf of the entire Iranian population?

t1_dsiggnf	0	*	No, it was given a real world, fiat currency price and btc paid at the exchange rate. BTC was not vital to the transaction.

t1_dsuwlsz	0	*	Of course it is a charitable decision, choosing to hire less educated low skill Hatians over other more educated low skill workers from other countries is a net loss decision.
t1_dsuumiu	1	*	Loool weak 
t1_dsuxbu6	1	*	Now youre just moving the goalposts.
t1_dsusmq3	0	*	What are these egregiously bigoted ideas? Merit-based immigration? A temporary ban on high-risk immigrants? Reducing inner-city crime?
t1_dsv01er	0	*	No, we use Them to communicate, they dont have meaning.
t1_dsv2411	1	*	Only if moderate liberals are now the conservatives of the past.  Which might sadly be true as far as media labels go.
t1_dsusmgz	0	*	The GDP of a country does not necessarily correlate to the average citizen's education or wealth. A country with a brutal dictator and an entire population of slaves could have enormous GDP.
t1_dsuvn6c	1	*	[youre counting mulattos and mixed people](https://imgur.com/a/TdCbA). So people who are racially the same as Dominicans. 
t1_dsv2ten	0	*	Source? I hear that said a lot but never with a source attached
t1_dsv910m	1	*	We could help Haiti a lot more, without hurting us, this is such a small example thats its irrelevant to base any argument of change over it. 
t1_dsusfn5	0	*	I mean providing a path to become a citizen is serving non-citizens. It's beneficial for citizens though if it brings in new citizens who can contribute to the economy.
t1_dswb67h	1	*	It's called funnelling or creating a choke point but that is a separate issue. Feelings aren't truth.
t1_dsuu607	1	*	Reddit aside, I think it's in our best interest to at least research what works best around the world. I think an open mind is the path to greatness.
t1_dsyj9j1	0	*	> Ethnicity  > noun  >the fact or state of belonging to a social group that has a common national or cultural tradition.

t1_dsuru9p	0	*	This country was founded on immigration and became one of the most powerful nations in the world because of it. Let's change everything.
t1_dsvdlti	0	*	It really doesn't. even if it's 2000 less people they have to chase down that's still not a noticeable difference. There are tens of thousands of people overstaying visas.
t1_dsutvk2	1	*	What?
t1_dsuw194	0	*	I didn't. You are claiming your job is easy. Do you know what easy means?  
t1_dsvyc5q	1	*	It was apparently removed by a moderator for making too much sense. I can PM it to you.
t1_dsv8gs4	1	*	What is artificial about it? 
t1_dsuti9j	0	*	Farm hands aren't always downtrodden destitute people. I met some ranch hands in Texas that made $3.5-4,000 a month. Hardly something to scoff at 
t1_dsv1ljq	1	*	Yes. Symbolic gestures like banning 64 Haitians. Or kneeling during the national anthem. Both get a reaction from Trumps base. Your very easy to manipulate.
t1_dsuty3a	1	*	He sure liked extractions and targeted killings. Special Forces, all branches, were busy under Obama.

t1_dsvslfn	1	*	God dammit I need to stop being so naive on Reddit.
t1_dsuu0yf	1	*	Blame the Republicans that allow monopolization 
t1_dsut5u7	0	*	Yeah but your intense studies have nothing on Trump's genes, which I have been told are 'very good', and 'smart'.
t1_dsvrgb9	1	*	Nope. If they get caught they get deported and banned for up to 10 years.

t1_dsv67ti	0	*	I should've clarified that I was talking about America there I guess.
t1_dsv4402	0	*	Ok.  Raise wages for the lowest, and that is subsidized by higher costs paid by all.  In the end, that is a net benefit for those competing for the low wage jobs
t1_dsuugtt	0	*	Why do you assume my anger is misdirected?
t1_dsuspr8	1	*	Ok Trump. You're making it sound like they come from a shithole...
t1_dsvtx0t	1	*	Yeah, we don't have nearly enough fucking land up here, shut the borders down!!!!
t1_dsv1aye	0	*	^^^ in this very thread >jobs are not a zero-sum game. To make a very complicated matter dead simple:  >**More people => more consumers => more demand => more jobs**      
t1_dsva4ih	1	*	It was just a simple analogy about productivity and efficiency, so assume the 100 yards is along a steep cliff trail, and you only have enough room for people to be lined up single file.
t1_dsuy6oy	1	*	Believe it or not immigration policies can change over a couple hundred years...
t1_dsutitp	0	*	I don't know, comprehensive immigration reform? 
t1_dsus5b5	0	*	Lot of employees are doing a poor job. Tough border control would lessen the burden further down the line
t1_dsuvk6o	1	*	Like Mexico and the Haitians are doing now? Yet you're crying about it pretty badly. You can't just say deal with it then turn around and cry when the same thing happens to you. What a schmuck.    
t1_dsusujx	1	*	Put them all in a prison colony
t1_dsusob7	1	*	fuck off. We pay taxes in America to benefit Americans. 
t1_dsusfw6	0	*	True. But from what I've heard that wouldn't be for long.
t1_dsuusb9	1	*	Well... all I can say is Mexicans been taking it back lmao. Don't get mad when Africans that were brought here from the slave trade want a better life and come to America

t1_dsv7rk2	1	*	SOJA????
t1_dsut61x	1	*	Okay that's great but 8 of the 20 overstayed their visas year-on-year  That's at least an understandable reason to revisit the idea of the 20 at all
t1_dsutvwx	0	*	He didn't. The comment is pretty neutral. Not his fault if Trump makes neutral look good.
t1_dsvj0f7	1	*	> none are from remotely western countries.  Categorically untrue. 
t1_dsut49d	0	*	That not what you said and your utter failure at sarcasm just shows how dense you are. Stop embarrassing yourself and just U0001f92b
t1_dsutzd6	0	*	My guy, they both suppress wages. Illegal immigrants do so more significantly but at a higher risk, legal immigrants do so through sheer numbers.  Call me a dick, doesnt mean you arent ignorant 
t1_dsuv7nu	1	*	Appreciate the Sopranos reference
t1_dsvc1ut	0	*	Woosh
t1_dsvfj56	1	*	So if you accept one person you must accept them all?
t1_dsuyih7	0	*	Youd be surprised. 
t1_dsurbfm	1	*	The irony is you see this as an insult to Trump supporters and not a reflection on who you keep company with
t1_dsuu3vy	0	*	Hmmm ok. I guess I never really thought about India and Pakistan being in the Middle East. I think those are mostly considered to be Asian/southeast Asian countries. 
t1_dsus9qu	0	*	Conservatives only care about people if they're white christians... or corporations.

t1_dsvkyy0	1	*	Let me repeat this for you, since you went out of your way to research. He is a settler. You don't get to live in Israel with a US passport alone. Visas don't allow you to own a home in a settlement.
t1_dsviab7	1	*	When you engage in conversation with idiots.
t1_dsv622l	1	*	Research is not needed for common sense. Trump and his followers are pants on head retards. 
t1_dsvxa8x	0	*	His grammar was fine. His spelling is a bit off, though.  As an older brother, I second his sentiment.
t1_dswdjt8	0	*	You were clearly equating me with our buffoon of a commander-in-chief.
t1_dsw0f2r	0	*	Oh yeah for sure, but the Supreme Court thing came somewhat near the end of a lame duck term, and the GOP was doubling down on getting a republican elected last year. Yeah, it worked :/
t1_dswbdjd	1	*	I like that it's called the Toupee Fallacy and we're talking about Trump. If he knows two things...
t1_dsvddcj	0	*	Good point, thanks, I'll upvote that. U.S. education is def bad though, regardless of how other, mostly poorer countries are doing. We can be doing much, much better.
t1_dski533	1	*	This sounds like a character Charlie would create. #alwayssunny
t1_dslo8ux	0	*	So it's had quite a bit of time to build itself up.
t1_dsknce9	1	*	If you think that All Haitians are unskilled and uneducated (Therefore unfit for merit based immigration), you are the bleeding Moron who might give the moron in white House a run for his money.
t1_dskrbeo	1	*	Nah Russia will always like him. Best we can hope for is like Lysol numbers.
t1_dskov04	0	*	Switzerlan? Progressive? Have you taken a look at this country's politics? You'd notice that it's much more conservative than progressive
t1_dskvkow	1	*	Don't fool yourself into thinking Canada is lax on immigration. Take it from a Canadian, although you are always welcome.
t1_dskoywn	0	*	What does other countries being shitholes has to do with Republicans? 
t1_dskk89v	1	*	Every country had western influence at some point. And some countries are great, some are okay, and some are shitholes. 
t1_dsm5jkw	1	*	What a narrow metric of success. If that's the case, no country can criticize any other country ever
t1_dsk7360	1	*	You may be deluded when it comes to politics but your roast is on point.
t1_du177yt	1	*	Well since it's just water, no, not really.  But in the context of religion, they put a label on it, so it's like taboo to drink it or something. I'm not religious so idk really.
t1_du14ysm	1	*	they would, if they had, you want to say. 
t1_du0z7d3	0	*	The thing is, when you actually *get* better you also *feel* better!  You ALWAYS get more bang for your buck from proven medicine than from idiotic hippie-dippy woo.
t1_du15a5p	0	*	I'm lazy; what you find?
t1_du1ml13	1	*	Seems like it so far! Doctor said it might rotate back over time if the muscles don't strengthen up, but I can just go in and have it put right again.
t1_du1c4ly	1	*	Thank you! 
t1_du1qz9r	1	*	Good call there. 
t1_du0sxv6	1	*	Chiropractors who are decent are called osteopathic physicians, not chiropractors.
t1_du0w9y4	1	*	Most likely. An alot living in an urban area will probably have a weakened immune system.
t1_du2t0ni	1	*	What laws are you talking about? What kind of services can chiropractors perform that would fall under the scope of medical primary care?
t1_du0sp9c	1	*	Canada and some other countries have much more stricter programs for chiropractors than the US so you two might have different experiences with them.
t1_duggkga	0	*	Try again.

t1_dso2gw7	0	*	Oh  you're one of those guys... No need to click on your link as people like you spread the very hate ypu claim to be combating. You will now be blocked. Life too short to deal with bigots
t1_dsi1n5t	1	*	You mean the completely unsubstantiated claim that the Russian's lost 100 man-portable nuclear weapons
t1_dsxlf58	0	*	The Sea of Azov belongs in a Heinlein book.   You know it. I know it.
t1_dsybzd5	0	*	I am sure the mountain Turks could do the wacking for us if well armed. 
t1_dsxpr5z	1	*	My comment was about the only warm water port bit. I assumed that you were talking about something on Russian land in the Black Sea. I didn't know about Tatrus until after I sent that reply.
t1_dsxbggk	0	*	I meant to as I got confused with the Sea of Azov, thanks for the correction 
t1_dsxpvr2	1	*	No, not at all.  If all members of NATO agree that one member is not longer an ally they can trust, they can basically tell him to fuck off, and ignore any article it may want to enact. 
t1_dsx15fn	0	*	I mean, can you get much worse than the Rape on Nanking?
t1_dsxeb5y	1	*	What's wrong with blitzkrieg? It was efficient and killed less people than a prolonged war with France.
t1_dsydoc0	1	*	I am very sure that a larger percentage than 5% is of various heterodox sects .
t1_dsyd4lj	1	*	Mass refugee flows happened much before intense fighting.  After that, people sneaked in and out of kobane through Turkish border.   
t1_dsxa5zg	1	*	Lol bullshit
t1_dsyu8ni	1	*	Their actions in ES-Territory rather speak of turkification approaches. They came to stay. I doubt it will be different in Afrin 
t1_dsxkx5z	1	*	Gave up on your bad analogy and went straight to propaganda, thought I was talking to a normal person. Damn.
t1_dtkykum	1	*	I don't think that's a good enough reason to hand over the power and resources to the oligarchs who serve no one's interests but their own.
t1_dtl0v0x	1	*	Well yes. Thats a problem with democracy. It is the responsibility of citizens to demand the right things, and vote for the right reasons. 
t1_dtki91u	1	*	>than most countries with universal healthcare  False. It's all countries. The US spends the most money on healthcare of any country.

t1_dssgynd	0	*	See my other reply. I do read my Bible, and from what I know of the Q'uran, it's a violent book. The Bible is a violent book. Life today is violent. Both books have an underlying message of peace.
t1_dst0wt4	0	*	Yeah, those damn Jacobins, just overthrowing the friendly monarchy, those extremists!
t1_dssyvnj	0	*	Yes. I would be equally horrified if the kid was suicide-bombing Nazis.

t1_dst8hdg	0	*	yeah if you think that is real you are dumb as fuck
t1_dssndk6	0	*	Yes, and it's important to remember they both make execution videos for the same reason. To intimidate anyone who would stand against them. It's important we don't let them intimidate us.

t1_dt3ylr7	0	*	Your justification is stupid, just like you and your sad country
t1_dt4q9ut	1	*	You should read up on Chinese history before calling other people colonizers. China is actively colonizing neighbouring countries right now. Sweden quit that shit centuries ago.

t1_dtg4hqv	0	*	Wait, you're telling me it does make a difference which crook I vote for? Hell, I liked Bernie and Trump for the same reasons, no establishment bullshit.
t1_dtgz14d	1	*	Definitely a thing in Germany, though not quite as bad.
t1_dthvtx2	0	*	Nice post hoc fallacy there. Why do remainiacs so consistently fail at logic?

t1_dtm0mg6	1	*	Salvia isn't cannabis. And I've never tried it but I've mostly heard bad things about it. I've done a lot of drugs but I don't see myself trying it ever.
t1_dtm0v7l	1	*	Oh ok, that's good then.
t1_dtuay9b	1	*	I agree, when the wealth 90% of wealth is held by the 1%.  what does boycotting the remaining 10% they don't own do?  Nothing, is the harsh truth.  Unpleasant change is often done by force.

t1_dufmu5j	0	*	Except circumcision, it appears. 
t1_dufa6gr	1	*	Maybe not but you are saying it's ok to attack one gender but not the other. And that's not ok.
t1_duhk6vd	0	*	That's nice for you, but you can't speak for other people, and neither can their parents.
t1_dug50nx	1	*	Nope! My track teammates :)
t1_dufkl4l	1	*	I'm not talking about the worst case.

t1_dsjocbe	1	*	Those are articles on the philosophy of mathematics. I don't see the relevant distinction.
t1_dv29do5	1	*	Exactly, non mainstream media is pretty much mainstream nowadays. And they're insanely partisan. Shit like Infowars, /pol/, youtube drama merchants, breitbart and such. 
t1_du5ke84	1	*	No such thing as good guys and bad guys. Just normal people and assholes.

t1_duaq93s	0	*	That's why I also said 2000.
t1_dua9ayb	0	*	How so? Remain doesn't change anything, so there's zero risk to pick the option.
t1_dua9vdx	1	*	All upcoming elections will be rigged and/or hacked so I think it's safe to say you're stuck with him.

t1_dua3hsl	1	*	retarted kek
t1_dub3s8l	1	*	And that blame goes on the moronic non-voters. They shouldn't need to be enthused like a kindergarden class to vote.

t1_dua9j1f	1	*	The phrase is weve made our bed, were sleeping in it.  
t1_duabn0e	0	*	Yes, but it goes against the explicit will of the people, so it really shouldn't. I would much rather we didn't Brexit, but we voted and so we should honour that.
t1_dua5i8g	0	*	Did I ever said they were racists? I said they acted irresponsibly with their vote. Voting is both a right and a duty.
t1_duagd8u	0	*	Huxley was warning it would happen as a natural consequence of tech progression, which is part of the problem. He was a pretty prescient dude.

t1_duacld8	1	*	Lol that's not the way democracy works though is it? 
t1_dua8e0g	0	*	As a European I find it very funny that you think reddit is left leaning. Using American measurements basically the whole world is left leaning.

t1_duacirc	0	*	> Ill see you in 10 years when the UK is a superpower again  They haven't been a super power since WW1, good luck with that.

t1_dua4ufs	1	*	They sure did, buddy. They sure did.
t1_duc8jci	0	*	If its 90%+ foreign then it isnt British is it. If every single MEP voted for x, but every single British MEP voted against x, then the vote for x would win, even with 100% of British MEPs against it.

t1_duqlrqf	0	*	No, that isn't the only thing that matters. Does it not bother you that someone completely unqualified for their position is briefing a foreign national on our sanctions on North Korea?
t1_dur4tw2	1	*	I mostly agree except none of this relies on GOP voters voting democrat, it is all about the turnout of different demographics.

t1_duqv8vs	0	*	> Hillary did with her deplorables comment  You never even read the full quote, did you...?
t1_duqghc2	0	*	Why should they change?  They will gain power soon with zero change.   At least the Republicans are honest about being corporations bitch.  
t1_dur1yn2	1	*	Sadly, I think youre spot on. 
t1_duqzsxw	1	*	You can say that again
t1_dur8fsc	1	*	Hey! There are some really good Korean films. The K-Dramas, on the other hand, are unbearable. (I have a Korean wife)
t1_dsw47k9	1	*	Well, true, but if some of the existing wall IS refurbished, the Russian troll farms will take advantage of those pictures.

t1_dv5pofb	0	*	So you are just throwing unproven accusations based on your thoughts and feelings.  Btw the subtitles of the video you posted is bs. He doesnt mention mongolia and other mps are barely audible. 
t1_duyq69g	1	*	It worked out for Turkey against the Armenians didn't it? It would be fun to watch the muslims get their asses handed to them one more time though. Knock yourselves out.

t1_dtd5bqq	1	*	sSo theif A would rather have people talk about him behind his back?
t1_dtcmstr	1	*	Well, Russia is currently ruled by a man who bombed his own people in a ploy to seize power, so that's a bit different from most other countries.
t1_dtcli6p	0	*	He didn't say impose, he said promote.
t1_dthig2m	1	*	You're right, didn't consider the additional delay from being horizontally away from the ground station and the server.
t1_dsts8xx	1	*	Yes, yes he does :-D  I do enjoy the irony of Bannon, the next Karl Rove or Grover Norquist managing to lose an Alabama senate race to a democrat. Im still savoring that
t1_dstn2ts	1	*	>Trump resigns in protest / attempts to save face - somewhere in 2019  He might also blame the Dems while protesting. *whataboutism*  
t1_dsta3kk	1	*	it sounds funny?
t1_dste9f5	0	*	Indictment of the president wont happen. Period. The DoJ consensus is that you cant indict a sitting president.  Impeachment wont happen if GOP is in charge, even if Mueller recommends charges. 
t1_dstyum1	0	*	House of cards was a documentary all this time
t1_dstz2q9	1	*	It's decorum. You concede to show grace in defeat. For some reason, lately the GOP has decided that decorum has no place in the government. It's rather disheartening. 
t1_dssxdsa	0	*	Didn't claim any of that. Didn't even specifically mention Trump.
t1_dst5xff	1	*	Well he is 1337
t1_dsu5cxj	0	*	Considering Trump said that he fired Comey because of the Russia investigation Im going to say it was to derail the investigation.

t1_dstbs39	1	*	Correct.  Do you know Roy Moore?  Sure do  Is he an alright candidate?  Yup  Mission accomplished
t1_dstf4a3	0	*	If he is impeached and leaves/is removed he will likely face charges. Unless the next presidential schmuck pardons him al a Nixon.
t1_dstdmcm	1	*	Downvotes? Ha - rage-a-saurus does not care about downvotes. I pick the flesh of my enemies from my teeth with downvotes.
t1_dstxm2y	1	*	To be fair, a Democrat winning in Alabama is a good indicator that reality has broken a little bit.
t1_dst9d4b	0	*	Ignore him. He's just trying (and failing miserably) to sound smart. It's embarrassing, really.
t1_dstcbdm	0	*	And he probably thought that the black vote wouldnt be there in an off-year special election.

t1_dtjhew6	1	*	Of course they arent when your comprehension sucks.
t1_dtj9l3h	1	*	It would encourage more domestic producers and int'l manufacturers to make their products in the US. That's the point.
t1_ds5omhf	0	*	Perhaps you should go write to your MK in Tel Aviv?  Oh wait, they aren't there.
t1_dusvlll	1	*	Hm, an ideology that is the polar opposite of Fascism? People advocating social and economic equity not liking Nazis? Heavens, no. That's completely unbelievable.

t1_dt6tm8k	1	*	Im not sure if hes created any but surely hes helped make it more mainstream.

t1_dt76jq6	0	*	You might think he was trying to strengthen ties with Cuba or something. How was his dad a socialist? Some of the identity politics may be silly but it is overblown by the media. yeah? Anecdotal bs.

t1_dt70fna	1	*	No. Today he fucking understood. 
t1_dt778c7	0	*	There's extremely few super rich, though right?. I would think even taxing them at 90% wouldn't get you near the revenue of taxing the middle class and poor at a marginally higher rate than we do now.

t1_dt74nmf	0	*	Are you considering the opportunity cost of equivalent wages when in school, but not working, for their skill level and hours worked?
t1_dt77rdd	1	*	Why? I would pay more personal taxes in exchange for a lower corporate tax rate. Lower corporate tax rates=more revenue=more growth=more jobs.

t1_dt6itcn	0	*	Making wrong predictions while ignoring all the factors you don't want to include doesn't make your opinion a fact.
t1_dt89io7	1	*	You don't seem to understand what the words Islam, Islamic, Islamist or fundamentalist mean, which would explain your perverse position.

t1_ds3u44y	1	*	How am I being a snowflake?
t1_ds4dl09	0	*	Death penalty for rape and kidnapping can make things worse for the victims though. Criminals would have an incentive to kill the victim to leave no witness to potentially avoid death penalty.

t1_dtl92yk	0	*	Changing the definition of mass shooting in order to lower the statistics is like changing the definition of a gallon of gas in order to lower the cost of gasoline to under a dollar.
t1_dtl3rjw	0	*	Oh sure - the US cares about it with thoughts and prayers, I believe that. But until they actually do something legislatively I have no problem painting with that broad brush.  
t1_dssf9o3	1	*	Yet you have no problem spouting bullshit as if it's fact without backing any of it up with any sources.   Look at my other comments and how to do it properly if you need any help.

t1_dsme5tl	0	*	Lol, you honestly think a massive regulation cuts and a corporate tax cut had nothing to do with it? You are fucking delusional.
t1_dsmco41	1	*	Youre probably right.  Being subjected to prosecution by an oppressive communist regime because he dared to criticize their leader probably makes you jaded.

t1_dt5gbq2	1	*	Idk.   I think there is a vocal contingent of green voters who care.   The rest of the country really doesn't.   Maybe it's self serving.    
t1_dt5yhzh	1	*	More likely, Trump doesn't even know it exists.  
t1_dt564nf	0	*	Also because admitting that Trump made a major policy decision the right way probably causes them physical pain.

t1_dt5ei95	0	*	I think the new global climate dlc will make Canada tier 1
t1_dt58ppj	0	*	unfortunately American farmers pumped too much milk and now have to be subsidized by the american tax payer. Since Canadians don't pay the subsidy, milk products look cheaper.

t1_dt4vq9x	0	*	The whole point of TPP was to hedge against China, which is a good thing for the West.
t1_dt6d3gb	0	*	You think government polls mean anything? When you poll certain people in a small area you can severely skew the numbers
t1_dt5bo1d	1	*	Yeah a fluctuating dollar is not good  But a stable lower than American dollar that we had for quite a few years prior to the oil crash was wonderful
t1_dt57bc7	1	*	Thats how it would be on paper but honestly a lot of people will buy the cheaper milk because then they can make their money stretch farther.

t1_dt5uojo	0	*	They get paid more to do someone else's bidding. I'd do the same, to be honest. Give me enough money and I'll say whatever the fuck you want me to say.
t1_dsz6uty	1	*	Those claims are not in geopolitically sensitive areas and aren't denying nations access to natural resources like oil or food. Use your brain.

t1_ds4fvxa	1	*	He explained it already, stop being thick.   
t1_ds4wpsj	1	*	Agree, to be clear I think Saudi Arabia being unstable is a very very bad thing. I'm just noting this as another negative effect Trump has had.

t1_dv1jaq8	0	*	The french judicial system isn't an opponent of Le Pen. She actually broke a law here. No one invented anything to get her arrested. 
t1_dv15jxl	0	*	She still could go to jail.  >If the case reaches trial and she is convicted, the 49-year-old could face three years in prison and a 75,000 (xa366,000) fine.  It is a possibility.

t1_dv1mb7k	1	*	I think it's the part where you hate everyone who's not of the same race as you or convenient ideological allies.  Also skirting around Holocaust denial (although that was more her father).
t1_dv0z5g5	0	*	Then why does /r/watchpeopledie exist? Reddit hasn't banned it.
t1_dtuk618	0	*	The only point to do it is to test doing it. But thats a reasonable point!  Space travel in general is a pointless endeavor. 
t1_dtwea9q	0	*	Because they earned it. There was a very real chance they would die every time they went into space. When Elon pilots his own rocket ship, then it'll be a fair comparison.

t1_dtul0kl	1	*	Yea but theres no oxygen to make fire so the tinder would be a waste. Plus it seems dangerous to have open flame in a moon base if youre talking about using tinder indoors.

t1_du75iq9	0	*	Let me guess, you're also a feminist who believes there is no biological difference between males and females?
t1_du7apgt	0	*	... What? He died after being sent one thousand years into the future. In the show, the cure for bonitis was already found, but he was too busy doing other shit that he forgot to get treated.
t1_dspy0ua	1	*	Thanks for the link. That terrifies me.  P.S. You got down voted for providing a link to actual information that upsets the echo chamber here.
t1_dsorxdy	0	*	> The US hasn't always been on the border though.   The US has had troops in Korea since 1953, long before Kim Jong Un was even born. The war has never officially ended.
t1_dsltlyh	1	*	Yea, the strongest person on earth and the leader od the strongest country on earth wouldn't  know something like that. Sure thing, CIA guy
t1_du46auz	1	*	Ah yes, the fun of your daily water supply being toxic. Just like the good old days
t1_du467zo	1	*	Most of the links point to a fucking moron he already knows.
t1_du4o4hf	1	*	Sure.  None of them are in as poor of a shape as PR.  They're spending a whole lot more than they can afford.
t1_du46lsj	0	*	Uhh you do realize some things don't LEAVE the body right....? As in.. it accumulates.. you DON'T excrete it...
t1_du43ve9	0	*	God that sounds like a political mess.
t1_du9irgg	1	*	After a quick google search it appears that you are right. Damn that's fucked. What a stupid law. 
t1_du4b446	0	*	https://www.google.com/search?q=president+of+puerto+rico  There's a President of PR, outside of the Senate. Just in case you missed it.

t1_du4uhyk	1	*	Yes but parts and design can take time. It has only been a few months which is a long time to be without power but is not really very long at all for such a massive project.  
t1_du47dhs	1	*	As a puerto rican, who has already visited family multiple times....unless you are in La Perla or a high crime urban area no, there are not muggers out waiting to rob you. 
t1_du49yrs	0	*	Yes, and they most definitely report on the decisions and direction that the administration takes. Because that's their job.  Not their fault the direction wasn't in Puerto Rico. 
t1_du4asmd	0	*	They were suppose to have power restored before the end of the year and its at 75%.
t1_du4bxwk	1	*	I think Obama is also responsible for JFK's murder. 
t1_du478lh	1	*	You're probably getting downvoted because that's the joke. Not because people don't understand.
t1_du4f4ti	0	*	Um... What?  Why do we have shipping harbours then? 
t1_du44lji	0	*	That doesn't sound corrupt. That sounds like a well run business to me.

t1_du47hvr	0	*	Cuba was never a utopia, and never will be, they started out poor and have improved since then, despite heavy sanctions enforced by the US.
t1_du42wgx	1	*	With a world-renowned healthcare system and electrical grid.   Just because its generally a bad form of government doesnt mean that there arent aspects of it that are admirable. 
t1_du45lz1	0	*	Also the Cubans probably have a smaller grid because not many people are allowed to use the internet and use less electricity than the average Puerto Rican.
t1_du4devq	0	*	You cant really detect one atom. I think the more accurate statement would be that no *detectable* amount of lead is considered safe. 
t1_du56tkt	1	*	Surprised its not a link to he  who will not be named who runs the FCC
t1_du43o46	1	*	Wrong.  Do you pay your power bill to the federal government?    Thats like blaming the federal government for a pothole

t1_dumzf4m	1	*	But Harvard's rules allow for a club like that to be all-male, since there is a specific need for it. But your debate club or your kite-flying club doesn't and can't be.
t1_du34sdo	0	*	It won't be to a politician just like Soros' donation.
t1_du32jkh	0	*	It doesnt have to be an insult to be ad hominem. It just is shifting the focus of the argument from against the content to the person who stated the content. 
t1_dsbojuh	1	*	You literally are doing just that, sitting there ceaselessly crying about it. U0001f923
t1_dsahxvq	0	*	Flynn lied to cover up his contacts with Russia, yet for you that is somehow unrelated. Bury your head in the sand if you want to, but you're talking nonsense.

t1_dse9a0t	0	*	I didn't vote for either. I have no dog in the fight. If you noticed, I also criticized the constant Hillary investigations.

t1_dtr0nqm	0	*	It's has everything to do with it... It's a bad example to the  rest of the world. If the US wants people to follow the rules it best lead by example  or shut the fuck up...
t1_duiakwn	1	*	He's is probably living in a Western country
t1_dujqbga	0	*	Just how fucking more arogant can you get? You make a statement with intellectual capacity of taking shit on the walkway than get upset why you get called out.
t1_duj34ge	1	*	Christianity doesn't allow slavery.  There's no country in the world with legal slavery, and Christians are supposed to follow the law.
t1_ds8aig7	1	*	Not true.

t1_ds5l2l2	0	*	Its kinda a moral-relativistic argument propagandized. They call it whataboutism.   ...if you wanted a better name for it...
t1_ds4q1ix	1	*	If only the US didn't have a long history of moving quickly from criticism to justification for regime change.
t1_ds55xou	1	*	I think he did count on the spies and maniacs. Not the nukes or modern chemical warfare though.
t1_ds4u3ib	1	*	Except they also attacked another white person earlier that day who fought them off, and they were running around yelling fuck white people and kill the white people there was a video of it.
t1_ds50guf	1	*	Sounds about right 
t1_ds4pndq	1	*	But one is clearly and obviously much worse. Which is this point
t1_ds571y5	1	*	Don't even open the hot coco ones around me. 
t1_ds55dsi	1	*	People started ODing in my city, that's why it was shut down here. 
t1_ds4tu44	0	*	Yeah, seems like the majority of the people peddling misleading racist talking points have that in common.
t1_ds4w35n	1	*	No history? Thats a bit of a stretch
t1_ds508au	1	*	Hes very misinformed though.

t1_ds4sb1o	0	*	wrong, live work and protested in NYC.
t1_ds4thh8	1	*	The police also basically ignored it. The only reason roof Koreans existed is because the police pretty much refused to do anything about it and shit just started escalating. 
t1_ds4u8hp	0	*	What does any of that have to do with Iran or its protests?  Or how putin hasnt had a legit election probably ever?
t1_ds4y0d6	0	*	Yeah, here in Russia we kill our gays!  There is no moral equivalency between the US and Russia. 
t1_ds4pm48	1	*	The US - NGOs and megacorps, the Ivy League class. It's a big money pump.
t1_ds6d543	0	*	Nope, but we are moving in that direction.  In fact, it is theoretically possible that if we keep moving in this direction without stop, in a few decades we really could be as bad as Russia.
t1_ds4yu9a	0	*	Anybody who says the US is a police state doesnt know what a real police state looks like, and this is coming from (apparently) one of the few outspoken supporters of BLM on Reddit.

t1_ds4o58t	0	*	Still doesn't change the fact that he committed a felony in the process.
t1_ds6dn48	1	*	Very true. The american government could and would kill protestors if they deemed it necessary and useful. They just have different thresholds.
t1_ds4q14x	0	*	Why not six a shit, even.
t1_ds5gnam	1	*	Oh boohoo. Yeah not murdering protestors makes it a completely different situation from Russia and Iran.

t1_dtrqvhi	0	*	Then how are there so many buildings?

t1_ds3bw8e	0	*	I think hes implying both the state and the media are run by the same people

t1_dt5xfw6	0	*	Your slothful induction is duly noted.   Reddit is a Russian target. Fact. Russia is, at this very moment, pulling out all the stops on its online influence operation. Fact.
t1_dt5uza7	1	*	It is now!
t1_dt61xtr	0	*	It also means the person is not necessarily credible.  Their credibility is assumed based on the reputation of the outlet reporting their information.  Lots of room for abuse.
t1_dt5z7nn	0	*	Or has the Republican party gone so far right that centrists ended up moving to the Democratic party?
t1_dt6hew1	0	*	They partially funded the Dossier. Fusion GPS was first hired by Trumps opponents in the primaries.

t1_dsy9cij	0	*	You mean it stops high income earners from being screwed *as much* by people that want to take their stuff.  Cash transfers really foster a culture of tax avoidance.
t1_dsuhxl0	0	*	That is why I am a egalitarian, because so few of today's third-wave postmodern feminists are actually egalitarian. Thank you! Have a great day!
t1_dsv2and	1	*	Historically, US unions have been very corrupt and involved with organized crime.   They still carry that stigma.
t1_dsuthxu	0	*	And yet, there are still private owned Swedish companies. It's similar in Germany and Germany is the world's 4th strongest economy.

t1_dsem5g6	1	*	In what way?  Obama lost the evangelical vote both times, despite being far more Christian than Trump.
t1_dsdi0jo	0	*	Why would he admit such a thing? The Mujahideen he recruited hate Americans almost as much as they hate Jews. They don't need to know that it's the CIA who pays their wages.
t1_dse238s	0	*	that also is not English, pleas post in English
t1_dtbj61s	1	*	Exactly.   We aren't going to pay them more, but we decided that you will a announcing voluntary pay cut.
t1_duszr57	0	*	Its spot on, unless you can point out a difference.

t1_dsvgh0a	1	*	Nice, I'm reporting from Brookland Park!
t1_dsvqrds	0	*	I ain't American. Imma blame Wikipedia for dropping the ball on that one lol. Maybe wiki was being optimistic, I know I was 
t1_dsvseck	1	*	Im gonna but this argument whenever a law-abiding populace that is armed also means low crime.
t1_dsxlmbl	0	*	Biodiesel.
t1_dswqdp4	1	*	Broken window fallacy
t1_dtshu79	0	*	/s
t1_dtsizxi	0	*	Yeah, but still, if you don't want other affairs to interfere in your Palestine, why are you countrying in other interferences?  
t1_dtuho9y	0	*	They claim ownership because they were and still are leaving there the whole time
t1_dtsl4ii	0	*	I don't understand what point you are trying to make. 
t1_dtsxh0q	0	*	> democratically elected  Tell me more about the voting rights of the 1.5million Palestinians within israels claimed borders.
t1_dtsflty	0	*	Sure, conspiracy threories. Who knows better than an r/conspiracy surfer?
t1_dtsr91g	0	*	apologies.. according to OP's source.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irgun
t1_dttkt4r	1	*	>and Egypt, Jordan, and everywhere else   Everywhere else buys their weapons. Only the corrupt stooges have their weapons donated to them. 
t1_dtse52r	0	*	I would define it more as War. The U.S. didn't conquer Japan in World War 2 for example.
t1_dtugb7p	1	*	They dont want a state, then they would have to. Get everything on their own rather than have it supplied to them
t1_dtttmyc	1	*	Any serious two-state solution requires that East Jerusalem be the capital of Palestine. If you don't understand that then you should read a bit more on this issue.
t1_dttdxkr	1	*	It is, because Americans are paying money to other Americans to spend their careers building weapons to send to a foreign country.
t1_dtsi9vu	0	*	Hey man, I agree with your assessment of his character.  But we dont have to kink shame people who are nothing like him :(
t1_dtsi8v9	1	*	I'm sure they'll swiftly vote then to the Un and send a fully accredited diplomatic mission to Palestine then
t1_dtskljz	1	*	Yep, still waiting for the U.N. to do anything about the pay to kill jews policy has towards Israel.  skeleton.jpg
t1_dtsncrz	1	*	Yes it's better. When we're talking about a group of representative nations, it's appropriate to deny people whose nations are not considered capable of using the power objectively.
t1_dtsi2ee	1	*	That doesn't have anything to do with their style of governmental systems. 
t1_dtbrmuk	1	*	Black people deeeefinitely aren't still enslaving black people in South Africa...nope!
t1_ds48lcy	0	*	Then you dont understand the situation in the peninsula. SK wants the land and people in NK and vice versa.
t1_dsqbbhm	1	*	If Obama was still around he'd probably have already invited her to the White House.
t1_dti5jda	0	*	I literally fought in this war.
t1_dsxwuzd	1	*	>Again, they let other organizations deal drugs and maybe even prevented their apprehension  So it's the exact same as now. 
t1_dt87kom	1	*	You didnt even read it did you?? It said she was brought from Canada to here in the US... and was raped by police in the Us lollllll
t1_dt85jjv	1	*	Must be why police keeps posting pictures of them ''seizing'' steak knives and bike wheels. 
t1_du3umb5	0	*	Classic American reply. Us Brits also have sheep to offer.
t1_dtcy67k	0	*	>In reality most of the Arabs immigrated in the 20th century.   Okay I see. Clearly there's nothing to discuss here, have a nice day.
t1_dtd5rx6	1	*	Are you not reading the comments on this reddot thread?
t1_duwihzq	1	*	That's how we get dead kids.
t1_dux4b4d	1	*	you're right. that's why they call them enemy combatants so they can avoid explaining their massive collateral damage issues  
t1_duxnlvt	1	*	Nah the Drone operators just describe them as [weeds and as overgrown grass.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/18/life-as-a-drone-pilot-creech-air-force-base-nevada) 
t1_duyvyaq	0	*	Instead of attacking me attack the argument. Your response is a typical one which is too simple and misunderstands the philosophy of antinatalism. 
t1_du2dpf3	1	*	Fasting actually has proven to have a wide range of adverse health affects.  Do a little Google work and you'll probably be surprised.  
t1_du2u9nw	0	*	Yes it works and some people do . Source: I live in a predominant Muslim country
t1_du2r8an	1	*	It is tall enough that the sun sets at a noticeably different time, but it still sets every day. 
t1_du339ed	1	*	What exactly is wrong with religious display in public? What if its a catholic priest walking to the church? A Sikh in a turban? If there is no victim, there is no crime in my mind.
t1_du2igfm	0	*	then why are u against this rule... it totally agrees with what islam says too...
t1_du2e05p	0	*	I still haven't mentioned anything about Islam. 
t1_du26az2	1	*	I'm not. I never even mentioned anything about religion.
t1_du2kh7v	1	*	Its tough no doubt but not overkill. I think eating more than 3 times a day is overkill should we ban that as well? 
t1_du25b0p	0	*	Not for children.
t1_ds8i5c0	0	*	It's a perfectly reasonable one. As someone who has seen these scandals come and go for 30+ years I have grown adept at spotting the stupid frivolous ones.
t1_ds8xmjn	0	*	No, but they may be using them build influence. The Kremlin using investing to gain influence is a real tactic. 
t1_dt1obfs	1	*	Lien with it rock with it
t1_dt1i42g	1	*	be independently wealthy.
t1_dt0vole	1	*	Don't you get it?  If you make delivering take out food illegal you'll only drive it underground. How many lives have been lost to the government's War on Delivery drivers? 
t1_dt12yvs	0	*	Pls, the labour abuse we face is in the present, and is far worse than automation.
t1_dsrk550	1	*	Lol check his post history and he claims to be a lifeguard also. He must be an awful busy guy.
t1_dsrb243	0	*	Thats a relief. I'm not gonna bother paying that bill then.
t1_dtkbrst	1	*	To be fair the Americans made the movies 
t1_dtq8ca5	0	*	Colbert and Oliver are not journalists... They don't appear on a channel that calls itself Fair and Balanced.   Anderson Cooper is a million times the journalist Hannity could ever hope to be.
t1_dtr664r	1	*	So the only way you can be pro immigrant is by being pro increased immigration? 
t1_dteuojw	0	*	The hypocrisy is tangible...
t1_dtq6k06	1	*	Thanks.
t1_dtri9qe	0	*	Ah well, sorry for that.... from this side of the planet it feels like about 50% of the population spent a year over there - sometimes two! 
t1_dun3rn1	1	*	\\[T]/
t1_dumre94	0	*	I bet on the potential lose of resources. There is a finite amount of stuff on this Earth and launching it all into space isn't a good long term choice. 
t1_dumogg1	1	*	All valid points, trash goes to the moon and songs of praise go to the sun
t1_dtsf08l	1	*	Even with the drop today, the market is still at a record high.
t1_ds97af7	0	*	You seem to have a lot of Israeli friends to talk to, and none of them ever make a point that contradicts yours. Echo chamber much?
t1_dsa0g9n	1	*	Egypt also recognized the state of Israel and its right to its land. 
t1_ds9ouwu	0	*	This is so untrue its crazy. The number of Palestinians in refugee camps is dwindling. 
t1_duvwda5	0	*	The 72 raisins thing was shown to be wrong ages ago, catch up if you're gonna be le atheist diehard ey? Funnily enough your own comment is more bullshit than the one you called bullshit. 
t1_duvteqo	0	*	72 raisins?? A small box of raisins has more than that. What kind of paradise is that?
t1_duxwa81	1	*	In my elementary school, we sang the national anthem everyday after the pledge. I realise now just how odd it is.
t1_dtozek2	1	*	I never said they do
t1_dsbl4qn	0	*	And even though Republicans control the Presidency, both houses of Congress, and the SCOTUS, they will still believe that its the Democrats fault.
t1_dsbrf8j	0	*	Can you explain how that's not contradictory? I'm genuinely curious
t1_dsg4ze9	0	*	Thats his plan. If that doesnt work for you then nothing will. 
t1_dsb76oh	0	*	He did come up with a counter argument....
t1_dsbwipq	1	*	Yeah, it is ridiculous. What a jabroni. 
t1_dsb48or	0	*	Do you think the US controls how Mexico spends its money?
t1_dsbqt5h	1	*	Right?
t1_dsb2grz	0	*	I dislike Hillary Clinton. Did not vote for her in the primaries. Still voted for her in the election because HOLY SHIT THE OTHER OPTION WAS FUCKING DONALD FUCKING TRUMP. 
t1_dsb43kk	0	*	What the heck is all of this jargon?
t1_dse37nw	0	*	I'll be speaking with about 10 of them tomorrow night as well as one of the guys who runs the special interest so I'll let them know it might fix up some issues. lol
t1_dsbeafc	1	*	There are plenty of examples for successful autarkic models, just look at North Korea!
t1_dsb1qqy	1	*	> equality  That's where the people who get offended over the slightest remark comes in.  You're right, though. It's a symptom of the fight for equality, not a hallmark of liberal ideals.
t1_dsb821i	0	*	If it's light enough to throw over a wall, it's not heavy enough to harm someone (aside from maybe an actual brick), surely
t1_dsb82s1	0	*	*For a few years*  Also the rich will be paying A LOT less in taxes.
t1_dsbp8yx	1	*	Count how many sealed indictments. 
t1_dsb0ys5	1	*	It's the browns that making the education bad.  That's why we need the wall. I'll build the very best wall be cause I'm a smart genius.  - orange man... err trump
t1_dsca2iy	1	*	Nobody but ancaps are arguing for pure capitalism. 
t1_dsbshxn	1	*	No, not technically, they are citizens, period. Don't like it, change the constitution. Don't go around using words wrong.
t1_dsb09il	0	*	Same thing with educating and creating jobs for the inner city. Education, jobs and hope and a lot of the worst will disappear over time.
t1_dsb30yx	0	*	If NAFTA gets fucked with because of this wall, we Canadians will be paying 
t1_dsb66bt	0	*	Your earlier statement about drinking the kool aid applies here.  People will commit self destructive acts sooner than they will let go of those sunk costs.
t1_dsbcx61	1	*	That campaign reeked of desperation. So many outright lies.
t1_dsb3h61	1	*	just take like baja or monterrey to pay for it. can you imagine all the drugs without the damn border problems.
t1_dsbbcl7	0	*	im the idiot? coming from a person who thinks it would be easy to climb a new (see prototypes) boarder wall with a rope and a ladder.
t1_dsb7yko	1	*	No! America is the best at everything! From manufacturing iphones to growing cocoa, America does it best!
t1_dsbfvcs	1	*	How do I scrub this off of my eyeballs
t1_dsb8fz9	0	*	So how does Mexico pay for the wall? 
t1_dsb32u0	1	*	And that was part of the problem. PA is just one state and even if she won PA it wouldn't have been enough electoral votes to get her there.
t1_dsbcuzb	1	*	We British had to build a sea for that reason!
t1_dsb77ye	1	*	I'm waiting for the cheesy comedy film where they fall in love 
t1_dsbaz1n	1	*	Damn right. I live in Ontario and want to build a wall to keep those french fucks in Quebec where they belong. ^^^/s
t1_dsb44cf	1	*	the right spent 30 years smearing her and bill. she didn't really do anything; it was a targeted attack aimed at eliminating the relevance of a political family.
t1_dsb7a0x	0	*	Get a treat for pop pop?
t1_dsb82u5	0	*	so 40 percent......huh.  You guys ever listen to yourselves?
t1_dsb3tfa	0	*	Sorry for calling you a Democrat, just seems to be the majority of reddit.
t1_dsaz6yf	0	*	It's almost as if there are idiots who subscribe to every ideology...  Is democracy *really* the best system?
t1_dsbmcyt	1	*	> confusing education with intelligence 
t1_dsb33b3	0	*	No, the argument for building a wall isn't that we should have literally zero immigration. It's that immigration should be controlled and we should only let in those who will help improve society. 
t1_dsb58fs	1	*	We're not that lucky
t1_dujhizo	0	*	Of course, but we already know that. If the point is to prove to non believers, placing anything which gives them doubt is a bad idea. 
t1_duylhpe	0	*	Yes, words have meanings... And you made up bullshit to dodge the question. 
t1_duy07el	0	*	The original objective of legalizing cannabis is to legalize cannabis What did you mean by this?
t1_dv2uz0h	1	*	Yeah, I don't really think he cares either way about the parties.  He just does whatever he thinks will benefit him.
t1_dtbu8k2	1	*	No. You won.
t1_dtcbguj	1	*	I disagree. We need more Imperial Star Destroyers in our navy.
t1_dtxeuv2	0	*	>  except via ROI-NI border  I did say that, maybe I was unclear?
t1_dtxrj7s	1	*	Nicely done
t1_dtxd90u	0	*	You always this much of a cunt? 
t1_dtxfttj	1	*	It's just not the same :(
t1_dtxqtkg	1	*	She can't say no to being their head of state, we can say no to them being Commonwealth Realms.
t1_dty33d1	1	*	My spanish friends can't even say a non trivial sentence in English. And everyone did High School. 
t1_dtxhbmr	1	*	Most of Australia is uninhabitable though and they already have problems supplying enough water to their current population due to droughts.

t1_dtxr04j	0	*	I did hear once that Australians are the biggest group of undocumented immigrants in the UK, dunno how many there are tho
t1_dtxjol6	0	*	I can't believe you don't see the hypocrisy considering how many Kiwis there are moving over to Australia in droves to find work.

t1_dtxohe5	1	*	Fair point.  Plus as someone else said the primary issue is level of development, and Singapore is certainly developed.
t1_dtxg58v	1	*	My reply was to whoever posted 'can uk aus nz ' etc , I think I posted wrong spot. 
t1_dtx8qti	0	*	And that's an entirely valid and just concern so I absolutely respect your views.
t1_dtxdgzp	1	*	You're looking for logic in the minds of racists - there is none. Polish is different and different is inferior. 
t1_dtxgbbj	1	*	Perfect thank you
t1_dtxh786	1	*	That was more directly towards the UK citizens itself but youre right, she isnt that relevant.
t1_dtxfbqb	1	*	AFAIK Scots were rather chill with staying in the EU!
t1_dtxerd6	1	*	Yes, I completely agree! Having a date of when the long distance would end made it way more doable. 
t1_dtxfeyd	0	*	More like a better life for them and their family rather than free travel.
t1_dtxchg5	1	*	We have the Australia tax, everything is expensive.
t1_dtxh1zw	0	*	> And it isn't like Australia is short on resources or space.  Potable Water?
t1_dtxgnm9	1	*	Yes it is. Australia's water tables are extremely overstressed. Free travel would break the country over a knee.
t1_dtxc6yu	0	*	Indeed it didn't, yet no one I know here has been put off in the slightest from carrying on as normal and going to gigs, pubs, shows etc in the city centre.  We can't let the dickheads win after all.
t1_dtxdfvf	0	*	My father was British and moved to NZ. I picked up a UK passport piece of piss. Having said that, I did do it 25yrs ago.

t1_dtxitib	1	*	This is basically Hong Kong. China or colony? *80% colony*
t1_dtxfpr0	0	*	That's minimum wage, if its a minimum wage job then no matter how many polish people come over it won't weaken wages, especially when the minimum wage is currently rising. 
t1_dtxqy7k	1	*	Fuck yeah teksavvy. After being shackled with bell for a while, I couldn't believe how cheap teksavvy was (just outside Ottawa, so not TO but still)

t1_dtxdogv	0	*	The South Asians and black people came here mostly during the 50s to 80s. Polish and other Europeans came here in similarly large numbers in the early 2000s when the EU advanced.

t1_ds5156l	1	*	Care to try that again? This time instead of lobbing insults maybe try having a discussion?
t1_dsx140b	0	*	If there was enough public will you could change that. You can't just appeal to the law as the reason for something. The law only has power insofar as people support and enforce it.
t1_dswp3pm	1	*	He knew how to make himself popular, but had no glue how to run a country, or make it good for the people.   Hardly brilliant.   We will pay for his lack of foresight for decades.

t1_dsx84ih	1	*	From the anti-abortion point of view you would be denying a child their right to live

t1_dswna1c	0	*	Go on...
t1_dswr952	1	*	I was mistaken, it must be a medical guideline the Royal College issued. I looked it up and there is no specific law for it.
t1_dswskos	0	*	Are you talking about Canada or America? Sounds like the latter but wasn't for sure
t1_dswlocn	1	*	That's why I hate when /r/atheism brings up abortion.  While many prolifers are religious, their arguments against abortion really aren't.
t1_dswud70	0	*	If you identify as ethnically Canadian, I do for instance, then you are. That is all that is required. Canadian is a post-racial ethnicity. /u/nicolas_kg is just some racist and not a real Canadian. 
t1_dswuitg	1	*	Because everyone should have access to high quality birth control and sex education.   Reduce the number of unwanted conceptions and you reduce the number of abortions.
t1_dswotg0	0	*	On one hand I feel for them because it's a meaningful job that helps the community, but on the other hand it is unfortunate that we have a surplus of teachers and shortage of medical professionals.

t1_dsy98kd	0	*	You mean they throw gays off buildings?
t1_dsxc46r	0	*	Correct - they don't go through an intact condom.      But plenty of STDs (HPV, Herpes, Crabs, etc) are also on areas that condoms don't cover... so there's still a 50/50 chance of getting something.
t1_dswtray	1	*	Perhaps legally, but its a medical fact.
t1_dswr89z	1	*	Yeah, I looked it up to verify as it's been a long time since I read it, and you are right.

t1_dsxh3q7	0	*	I know, but you currently have a right to own them don't you? 
t1_dsxisdf	0	*	I think the wording just sucks. I believe that it just means not to teach or practice those kind of things within the organization. I dont believe the organization has to be outright pro-choice.
t1_dswuhv6	1	*	No one asked to be born. If your mother chose to abort you you wouldn't be here to give a fuck.

t1_dsxofve	1	*	I can tell you that's totally false, America is always used to mean USA here.
t1_dsxa7rg	0	*	What isn't humane about assisted suicide? In all honesty I think it is the much more humane choice than forcing someone with a terminal illness to live a life of pain when they don't want to anymore. 
t1_dswo565	0	*	But like aren't those usually the youth leaders as they're able to use their authority? If so, why would they want to be able to molest people up to the age of 35?  Asking for a friend.
t1_dsxmbje	0	*	Those two things are not even remotely the same, you just compared a fetus to a cancerous tumor. Of course it is about morality. 
t1_dswn4p2	1	*	The more time away from his time as Prime Minister, the more I see that he was.
t1_dsxskx1	1	*	The law being clear does not mean we can't discuss it or disagree with it. I'm a bit confused with what you expect people to do, just agree with and ignore every law that is passed?

t1_dsx75ji	1	*	But its so BIG. That must mean its super populous right? /s

t1_dswnesu	1	*	Maybe some are, but the specific group that prompted this clause wasn't, which is a critical distinction that a *lot* of people in this thread are apparently not able to make.
t1_dsx1mgj	1	*	I don't know man I guess the only way to find out is to smoke a fuckton of meth and then find out what happens
t1_dsxhy6f	0	*	But what separates 12 weeks and 12 weeks and 1 day

t1_dswpceo	0	*	I understand the view point; I just think that viewpoint is rooted in ignorance of the issue. An idealistic, non-realistic opinion on a very real issue that millions of people face.

t1_dsxr469	1	*	thats exactly what I'm talking about. Thats not a good thing.

t1_dsxhfz7	0	*	What did I do to deserve the punishment of having to host a growing being inside me feeding off my body?   Maybe I should just drink all through my pregnancy too.
t1_dswpoa1	1	*	Okay got it.
t1_dswpj1x	1	*	Lol where did that come from? I recommend 2 Valium followed by a course of Existentialism.
t1_dsx6gu7	0	*	Yes, it does. If not allowing abortions is discrimination against women, then not allowing financial abortions is discrimination against men.
t1_dswo9ho	1	*	yes but it can survive without the mother after that point. It doesn't need to stay in the uterus to survive, although it greatly improves the odds. 
t1_dswzfvv	0	*	You don't think it's ridiculous to use the same excuse even without looking into the causes and whatnot, especially when the claim is made about goddamn Canada
t1_dswnyug	1	*	Don't doubt the left.

t1_dsz1arm	1	*	You think people stop thinking when they sleep?  Some scientist you are.  You're too ignorant to even argue with.
t1_dswpfv5	0	*	Not every, but most. They wouldn't be party leader if most of the party didn't agree with them.
t1_dsxa9pt	1	*	See my reply elsewhere in this thread.
t1_dswqyf1	0	*	The DNC emails showed they favourited her. I don't know how powerful you think the DNC is, but they don't have the power to sway primaries by, what was it, 4 million votes?

t1_dt2fye6	1	*	Sounds like Detroit Ghettotech not Hip-Hop :)
t1_dt2co1n	1	*	well, I'd rather lick ass than kill and buttfuck the corpse of a 5yr old girl.   Hey, you know what, you are right, hiphop does encourage intellectual thinking. 
t1_duyst7s	0	*	In case you don't know,  Japan was literally an ally to Hitler when the war crime was committed ...
t1_dshqmn7	1	*	Perhaps as a marker as to how little progress people actually make.
t1_dsn17su	1	*	hmm thought it was a non mobile link? Will fix this.
t1_dslv8ud	1	*	Its illegally occupying farmland, It was built disguised as a warehouse. Farmland is very scarce in China.

t1_duva8pl	1	*	I said it was in order to weaken Clinton in the very same comment.
t1_duuysul	0	*	Sorry I wrote an awkward sentence. The theory part is what happened after; I know the fishing origin is fact.
t1_duuhukk	1	*	And if Hilary also had the same specific policy about Russia, they would still go for Trump because he is a destabilization wildcard.
t1_duufwoi	1	*	Maybe you should read Foundations of Geopolitics.
t1_duui54h	1	*	Wrong. Pretty much impossible to determine how effective it is, so there is plenty of debate.
t1_duuduzk	0	*	Oh, I get it... sorry I read that with an entirely different tone! I apologize!
t1_duuigld	1	*	Perhaps it was originally necessity, then became a matter of culture?  Where large houses became considered as not only not cost-effective, but ostentatious?
t1_duuk11w	1	*	Surely a song would do them good...  I'll sing them a song of ice and fire!
t1_duui8hb	1	*	The Russian one; the Irish IRA was only Provisional.
t1_duv7mvh	1	*	Yeah, I'm sure that explains the 100% success rate.
t1_ds89w82	1	*	true
t1_ds8hx0u	1	*	Sure, theres some shale plays that arent viable until $70, but most of them have figured out how to do it under $50. Those holes are already drilled, and you dont need to park a rig above them.

t1_dt9bwjz	0	*	Youre right. People need to become aware of tribe mentality and learn to think past it. The type of thinking that served us well thousands of years ago is now causing us harm.
t1_dt9qyy2	0	*	Im just a dude playing a dude disguised as another dude!
t1_dtamxkv	1	*	Huh, I thought I deleted that comment.  I was wrong.  I didn't realize Mueller is 73.  In 10 years, Hanks would only be 71 and would be perfect for it. 
t1_dt9fcvp	1	*	So, a shithole then?   Glad we're on the same page.

t1_dt9sfqv	1	*	This is brilliant. One touch I'd change is the First of His Name bit, since he is actually a Jr.
t1_dt9nkae	1	*	You're saying america is ruined because the ratio of whites to other races is dropping?  How has the world changed but you've stayed in the stone age?

t1_dt9vbs1	1	*	Of course, but the other reply above is exactly the ignorance I'm referencing. Predictable posturing from the left. 
t1_dt9n98q	0	*	So youre saying there is not a single republican in the entire world who isnt stupid or a bad person? Unless you have a source for that claim, you cannot claim that it is not incorrect.

t1_dt9ujz8	1	*	Pit bull is actually a stand up citizen. One of the best celebs out there 
t1_dt9fd5n	1	*	That's a correction, not a redaction. Also, I've never claimed they were completely infallible, but all of their bold claims about Trump/Russia have borne out. 
t1_dta0jqx	1	*	The party in charge is *his* party. If he's impeached, it's because his own party agreed with it.
t1_dt9dax8	0	*	Deplorables works fine.
t1_dt987is	1	*	They always say this. Just ignore it. It's supposed to put the burden on the reader to disprove some total fabrication their bosses just told them to spout.
t1_dt9xdsd	0	*	The get the fuck out message comes from both sides so don't even try lol. If you can't see that you're delusional.
t1_dt9s7ce	1	*	The both sides are bad argument is BS, because clintons been investigated and it turned out to be nothing criminal.
t1_dt9bx0z	0	*	Memes may be studied in the future as a form of advanced image based communication 
t1_dt9gmjf	0	*	Sure it does.  But the key difference is that Trump is not only clearly incompetent, but has, at the very least, violated both law and tradition. 
t1_dt9qvk8	0	*	Probably Russian.
t1_dt9cxx7	1	*	Maybe they could leave him out in the sun for a while?

t1_dt9n6hg	0	*	Because the right literally just makes up stories to benefit them. They actually report fake news. Then they label everything they don't agree with fake news to confuse their base. 
t1_dtdogbu	0	*	Map meddling? It's not like they drew the maps. They were just better at playing the game. There's nothing wrong with that, it's not like democrats weren't also playing the same game.
t1_dt9hwal	1	*	First, I want to kill no one. Second I was in agreement with Yertley speaking about someone else. Third, you clearly have no grasp of the word assuaged or its place in a sentence.

t1_dtpukb2	0	*	The one I worked at wasn't refrigerated or anything but it definitely wasn't hot.
t1_dtpvoht	0	*	Holy fuck. Do people really do that? What about cans exploding because the content expands with the heat? That seems a stupid method for more than just one reason.
t1_dtpzb6n	1	*	It still does for many foods.  They might not heat it up for long but its required for a lot of foods.
t1_dtpx9fn	0	*	What about styrofoam/paper plates??

t1_dtq0rkm	1	*	It is a balance between both. I know, hard to accept that in such a binary-driven political framework we have.
t1_dtq863v	1	*	drink good beer instead.    No such thing, they're all nasty.    Drink liquor instead. 
t1_dtpzzn6	1	*	I would guess because not all regulations are equally sensible.

t1_dudb8xh	1	*	My point is he isn't a representative of the state as a whole or it's politics. He's an outsider that gets continuously shut down. Any sort of shame for that is ridiculous.
t1_dsej5ek	1	*	No doubt, my point is that government =/= civilization. People who throw around 'civilization collapse' are engaging in serious hyperbole.

t1_dsw9sew	1	*	That's why I downvoted him.

t1_dso25qu	0	*	Is this a UK thing? Is there a difference between traveling and driving??
t1_dsnx2q0	1	*	Not even. Theyd absolutely just regurgitate any random comment from any random redditor if it alleged something that coincides with or corroborates their world view.

t1_dso7kx8	1	*	Youd think after creating and writing Dilbert, Adams would realize Trump as the very corporate goon type he lampooned in the series.  But I guess he got infected with a serious case of the dumbass.

t1_dso6q83	0	*	You've completely missed the point that you called me alt right without there being anything to really suggest that. Do you think it's OK to just casually assume things like that?

t1_dtf7yx4	0	*	Not that I disagree with your post but why should marriage be put as necessary as being sound of mind?
t1_dteku8b	0	*	To throw at them. It's a traditional way of displaying mild displeasure with our politicians.

t1_du5ay3o	1	*	Probably read my comment too fast. Retry again as it might help you.
t1_dsxkejf	1	*	To offer a different opinion, I'd heard and read a lot about it, read it, and didn't think much of it. Gave it away and have no interest in reading the rest in the series.

t1_dussme8	1	*	The internet just punched you in the dick, my friend.
t1_dur6cny	1	*	Or drowning in cheese.
t1_dupz9jv	0	*	The insane whataboutism you threw out is pretty clear defense of NK. Even most assholes who use whataboutism would why away from comparing the US and NK.
t1_dupy8vz	1	*	Perhaps you should continue never posting, troll.
t1_dv2q2wp	0	*	Sure if the stock market did well, the thing is the stock market basically sucked during his term. 
t1_dv2m9mx	0	*	They're just too stupid to realize they're being screwed.

t1_dv370us	0	*	I thought China was using those countries to sell around the original tariffs 
t1_dv35zlg	1	*	In a REAL democracy, the highest vote getter wins.  Doesnt matter how much of a turd sandwich they are.
t1_dv32lxw	0	*	Im talking to you specifically, nobody else.  So no, not like my comment
t1_dv2sxoa	1	*	Wouldn't less competitors drive prices up? 
t1_dv2pm4u	1	*	So the US and Canada are steelmates?
t1_dv2mrud	1	*	Another point is how China manipulates is currency. 
t1_dv3avx3	0	*	Lol disagreeing is now melting down? No wonder liberals keep losing. Not a very likable bunch 
t1_dv2p8fs	1	*	then -> than, dude
t1_dv2me23	0	*	Clinton actually would have been pretty great, except for obstruction from a republican congress. 
t1_dv2t40y	1	*	There's no way President Trump would participate in insider trading. You take that ba...ha ha. Damn. I got most of the way through that sentence without breaking.
t1_dv2uh07	1	*	How do you reckon theat Ireland isn't a great place to live? It scores higher than the UK on most measurement metrics...
t1_dv2nng3	0	*	Trump U?
t1_dv2qihc	1	*	That's because compared to Trump he looks competent. At least he gave the impression that he kind of gave a shit about America and its well being (and wasn't a *constant* embarrassment).
t1_dv36ler	0	*	The US is a democratic republic with fucked up rules like the Electoral College.  The EC is not a Democratic idea in the least; its a republic idea.
t1_dv2zfob	1	*	Two gunshots to the back of the head, chop themselves up and throw themselves in a river. I'm suprised and glad Mueller hasn't gone that way. 
t1_dv2tnfr	1	*	Good point
t1_dv2pffu	1	*	I used to sub to that reddit, I still do, but I used to too.
t1_dv35sm4	1	*	Well seeing as how people have already responded to me and given all of the credit to Obama (even though he hasnt been president for over a year) it looks like Drumpf *isnt* allowed to take credit.

t1_dv31n1m	0	*	 But I also want to keep my rivals from also getting more money, doesn't more trade power in a node make them richer also?
t1_dv2umjr	1	*	He doesn't understand trade deficits. Does he not have an economic team to explain things to him?
t1_dv2s8sw	1	*	And that's why I like you Americans.  Individually you're great, I get that it's your system that's broken not you.
t1_dv2s7j0	0	*	Go on
t1_dv3umc4	0	*	Lol, definitely not from the Midwest right, because i have a different opinion? Right? Ha, people like you are exactly why he's gonna win again in 2020, four more years bro.
t1_dv3lpqb	0	*	Fair enough.  Synthetic is perfectly safe though contrary to popular belief and you can hardly tell the difference!
t1_dv2q57q	0	*	Those comments read as if half of them are just Russians.
t1_dv2p2is	1	*	People who say those things likely live somewhere that is not America. 
t1_dv2udwj	1	*	No, I mean 80k in 3 states was enough to make him win electoral college despite 3,5 mln popular vote loss.
t1_dv2szim	0	*	I'm Canadian, so I'm kind of hoping that I just get to to watch the chaos safely from shore.
t1_dv2v0jr	0	*	Why does that matter? Why does any of this matter? Let him golf, hell, I'd personally pay him to golf and relax, he works hard and deserves it.
t1_dv2r973	1	*	Or on a similar note, I think they associate coal with work hard everyday and new sources of energy are too easy
t1_dv37zl2	1	*	Hence why I spoke specifically about their impact on Americans, which is essentially nonexistent.  Thanks for reading. 
t1_dv370t7	0	*	Clinton would have too.  There still would have been no way for Trump to win. Where was he going to find another 3 million votes?
t1_dudq3am	1	*	You know those big ole pyramids?
t1_dueior1	1	*	Yes.
t1_dudxqdx	0	*	You mean the British came not the English.  Also why are you using the British also being bad as a justification for the Spanish atrocities? Youre almost saying its ok because others did it too
t1_dy4k81o	1	*	yeah I heard of that one too! But that is the Monkey God temple in Honduras. There are many ruins in mexico that haven't even finished being explored. 
t1_dudm7aw	0	*	But I thought we buried the gate? 
t1_dv5n724	0	*	Once you have one you would, you can adjust the temperature of the seat and water to your liking and they self-clean.
t1_dtufe4g	1	*	Oh, you were talking specifically about the US war on drugs. Yeah, that fulfilled it's purpose very nicely. Nixon is laughing in hell right now.
t1_dtugwe3	0	*	Isn't it the DA that makes those terms?
t1_dtue4xk	1	*	You at the very least get one hints to what the case is going to be about during the selection process.
t1_dtvof64	1	*	Yep, to Bavarias northern German doesn't sound anything like German.
t1_dtudoyx	1	*	ayeee
t1_dtw7qw8	1	*	I think the three of us are making the same point. 
t1_dtug8yy	0	*	Not in America. It's not a crime to know, tell about, or use jury nullification.
t1_dtujk09	1	*	If juries were expected only to robotically determine truth, they'd be pointless, and we'd have only bench trials.
t1_dtuenyo	0	*	Grow up.  edit: Took you literally, didn't realize you were the one who told the story.

t1_dtuqlpv	1	*	You are an example of the heroes we need.
t1_dtu7qqr	0	*	No, even in poor areas people chuck that shit to the curb.  They're hard to get rid of so you actually have people paying money to dispose of them
t1_dtukyk1	1	*	>Agree to disagree :)  Translation: I am clearly wrong but I can't admit it so I will now act as if I was correct and deflect all arguments.
t1_dtucqyi	0	*	Seems really counter intuitive, but when I get a chance I'll read into it. Thanks for providing the source. 
t1_dtvca6e	1	*	If only German was this logical...  The Feuerwehr (literally: fire defense) fights *against* fires.  The Bundeswehr(German army, literally: Federal defense) fights *for* the Federation. Hopefully... 
t1_dtugqz8	1	*	Freedom is a basic human right. They take that away if you smoke weed.

t1_duwfxq9	1	*	Need to show the world that USA is #1 /s
t1_duyhu5t	0	*	You need to keep trying until you find the right medication. The problem isn't feeling for people around the world. The problem is feeling for people around the world to an unhealthy extent. 
t1_duw4gis	1	*	Ow. Oof. Ouch.   My Australia. 
t1_duw2tmr	1	*	Thats really welcoming of you. I don't even know how to respond to that. That is certainly not the tone I get from the ASIF. 
t1_duwat5a	0	*	I think it will be a long time until it is commen knowledge, as well... I consider myself an educated person, but did not learn of it until a few years ago (and it imidiately made sense).

t1_duwxvnz	1	*	You mean Cornish Cross broilers, as in the most prevalent chicken on the market, or you mean Cornish game hens, the cute bite sized birds?
t1_duxh8sc	0	*	You need help.
t1_duwc2ua	1	*	Agreed, thanks OP for sharing. It's time that humanity at large become radical environmentalists, or we will be the generations that put the final nail in the earth's coffin.
t1_duvzmpp	0	*	Lol, is this sarcasm?  What do you want done?  What policy would you like enact to affect climate change?
t1_duy8jst	0	*	Wow you really went off on one. All I said was there easily obtainable evidence for the third claim. Didn't say I agreed with the person. I didn't ask for a 1000 page lecture either. 
t1_duw1oe0	0	*	Yeah cuz we all totally would've done it differently if we were alive then right 
t1_duwmxie	1	*	Oh my sweet [eternal] summer child...

t1_du72vh5	1	*	Trump Derangement Syndrome
t1_du73ed4	0	*	It is wrong though! No one should strive to be gay. No one should hope their children to be gay. Being gay is natural selection. Stop trying to make people gay.
t1_dtxnu01	1	*	I think we're supposed to use PC terms. Apparently troll hurts their feelings. I think advocates of alternative facts is the new PC term that we're using these days.
t1_dscy46c	0	*	I mean sure, but there are dissedents in china that end up dissapearing too ya know   Still a pretty big reach for a pay raise

t1_duv3vuo	1	*	The greatest recorded temperature change in 24 hours was caused by Chinook winds on 15 January 1972, in Loma, Montana; the temperature rose from 48 to +9 xb0C (54 to +49 xb0F).
t1_duuaclv	1	*	Below about 28, I get a little cranky. Start wearing the insulated jackets (instead of flannel and wind-breakers).  I imagine Chicago would break me in minutes.
t1_duuch0g	0	*	Go on....
t1_duu7rtc	0	*	I'm not sure insults like that are the best approach to take.  Your background is in atmospheric science or something related?  
t1_ds1si9u	0	*	The point is boycotts. Are you in the right thread?
t1_ds1pv7o	1	*	Followers of political ideologies have also been known to discriminate against the opposing ideology. You think capitalists get along well with socialists? Or, red-staters against blue-staters?
t1_ds1whxe	0	*	Did you stop caring about the freedom and security of Israelis after the first Zionist terrorist attack? Or do you just ignore the violence committed by Israel and its founders?
t1_ds1tfny	1	*	There's a pretty big difference between buying something from someone and actively donating money to organizations that openly aim to further your goals in other countries.

t1_dtlrqbq	1	*	> Also, is there no inter-marriage between races at all? I would assume that after well over a century, that many of the farmer families would be mixed by now.  0_o  
t1_dtm76pk	1	*	Why are you guys trying to blame communism/fascism/ideologies as the reason why it all failed. 80% of the reason why they fail is because of corruption running through their veins.
t1_dtu6hxm	1	*	Because people are afraid of information that would actually dispel their preconceived notions. They rather live in a nutshell and not see any proof that what they believe may or may not be wrong
t1_dtm8z4f	0	*	Yes, but they didn't penetrate much inland, did they?
t1_dtlg7y2	0	*	I would imagine all the mixed races would still be considered white. 
t1_dtlmmqf	1	*	The English were blessed with all the resources they needed, the oak to build a supremacy fleet.
t1_dto9fzg	0	*	That's not true, the land that was not tribal was split about 50/50 between the black and white population. (Though that was still of course unfair, with whites only making up 8% of the population)

t1_dt2p68v	1	*	Well, if I am going to hell for doing good works, I think it's worth it.
t1_dt2ztuo	1	*	Tell that to half the population.

t1_dt5up7w	0	*	OK, so I don't follow what your point is about the apparent lack of free speech in Europe is. 
t1_dt2mozx	1	*	People who bring US politics into everything are on par with Hitler so that's an apt comparison. 
t1_dt30f7j	0	*	Okay than when the Bible just goes from there was no light and without form and then there was light. How can we conclude that Big Bang and Bible are contradictory based on what? 
t1_dt2paib	1	*	See this all the time on job applications. I always thought the people making these were just idiots. 
t1_dt2k9yd	0	*	Does there have to be a reason?
t1_dt2ky61	1	*	What is important is that we do not wait on evidence. Instead we should all make an assumption based on feels and split into tribalistic groups and fight with one another until we get an answer. 
t1_dt2q5fx	1	*	You see, once upon a time Greenland and Iceland had different names but they got together and said you know what'll mindfuck people...
t1_dt2m9ef	1	*	Is a heart attack fatal if you die, but the doctors manage to resuscitate you?
t1_dt2m7gx	0	*	He's calling you a dickwad, because you are acting like one.  Just clearing things out.

t1_dt2opr9	1	*	You're welcome, Hitler.  ~US Politics, 2018
t1_dt2qunp	1	*	But also remember that Genesis was written in pre-davidic Hebrew. The literal translation is period of time. I'm honestly not 100% how we ended up with the modern translation of day.

t1_dtradch	0	*	You can take my kindness for hypocrisy if you'd like. Please feel free to speak your mind. All I hope is that you don't judge ones character based on where they're from. I hope you have a great day 
t1_dtr3yeg	0	*	Since this seems like such a common occurrence, wouldn't everyone immigrating to Canada expect this?  
t1_dtr7r1m	1	*	Your shame on you bullshit gets you nowhere and is the reason the left loses. Have fun with it. 
t1_dtqxb55	0	*	They immigrated from asia like 14000 years ago
t1_dtqxxoe	0	*	It's gotten a lot harder now than it was even just a couple years back. In contrast, Canadian immigration is much easier (at least for my background). 
t1_dtr7hxa	1	*	Care to explain how im misinformed? Or are you just going to pretend you know something that I don't? 
t1_dtqq5e6	1	*	Ignore him it's another dude wanting to use Asians to bash other immigrants, old news.

t1_dt9xh86	1	*	Could be worth looking into U0001f9d0
t1_dtamicp	0	*	Is that a serious question?  It's Facebook's entire business model.
t1_du54ie6	1	*	I think she'll give a FF. She's already whining that I never signed up for this; she knows the stakes.
t1_du4l46n	0	*	No i'm not. There's been exactly zero credible accusations of FB selling your data, its 100% bullshit and no amount of downvotes and conspiracy theories will change that.
t1_du77qg4	0	*	Yeah, you're ignoring how, a decade ago, trump had no idea he would go into politics; As far as anyone can tell, it was just a savvy deal.
t1_dteus7m	1	*	lmao what a tool
t1_dsf8q5v	0	*	>You can't supersede our laws.  How silly of me, I forgot only Verizon is allowed to do that.
t1_du3kx7c	1	*	This is true - we are an incredibly oil rich country, the only problem is that it's filthy and costly to extract.
t1_dsgrdwf	1	*	Hmmm...that's exactly what I said
t1_dtokaof	1	*	Maybe it has something to do with the industrial revolution taking place at the end of a miniature ice age. I just think we need to be careful about falling into the correlation/causation fallacy. 
t1_dv59unu	1	*	That's a poor comparison on many levels, not the least of which is that in your scenario the cops wouldn't half-heartedly throw a flash-bang at you but not attempt to pursue or arrest. 
t1_dv5ah1k	1	*	Dont let him rile you up. 
t1_dv4cfgj	0	*	>common German soldiers  so you are going to follow up with the clean wehrmacht myth?
t1_dv4sj1t	0	*	Still nothing compared to how deadly an actual grenade is. It remains misleading.
t1_dv5pqys	1	*	Where have I said anything about settlements?
t1_dv4vts1	0	*	Yea, actually, I have. Ever seen the damage rioters can do to someone?
t1_dstoai9	0	*	Yeah, who cares when it happens to foreign workers in my backyard? s/
t1_dsujqsf	0	*	And there are plenty of people who wouldnt mind doing it by dont because of the pay
t1_dsv6mp3	0	*	Where is that apartment? Because the average price for a 1 bedroom in Toronto is over $1000. Are you talking GTA or actually downtown?
t1_dufqlaw	1	*	GLIDESLOPE  GLIDESLOPE

t1_dufs2y0	0	*	Unless youre so dehydrated you cant spit
t1_dugqjio	1	*	He didnt say just teenage texters. The teenage parts just makes it worse because they are inexperienced AND they are texting.
t1_dufrzui	1	*	Even if it was working, there have been a few crashes where pilots ignored the GPWS. 
t1_dug1373	0	*	It's a joke, son, don't take everything so literally! 
t1_dufqq9d	1	*	Well, it's not working now.
t1_dufxkb3	1	*	Yeah, but it doesn't make driving any safer. 100 people dying in just one incedent vs. 1 person dying in 100 incedents is just as bad. 
t1_dugdysz	1	*	Your uneasyness is completely ridiculous.  It has no base in reality.  If you understood the chances, you should be shitting your pants every time you get in a car.  
t1_dufq0a2	1	*	Yeah sanctions be damned!
t1_dug0qki	1	*	Yeah, like if I am paying attention to the road and notice other people around me I can point out the horrible drivers and avoid them by slowing down or just letting them fly past me 
t1_dufqxne	1	*	GPWS has been commonplace since 1979, and all ATR aircraft are equipped with it as well as Terrain Radar.
t1_duftlp1	1	*	It says pull up, pull up. Retardx2 is for landing instructing the pilot to reduce the engines thrust to idle. 
t1_dug1alr	1	*	No problem.  Thank you for being the only positive reply.  
t1_dufmzp8	1	*	As in being in one versus a commercial jet. The crash rate between the two is astronomical. Lethal might have been the wrong word but fuck it it's late :P 
t1_dufumvf	0	*	Fuck the Japanese thought process. It's what killed these people and is crumbling their economy.
t1_dt5y6n8	0	*	Got it. You don't care if somebody is looking war graves.  I would attest the call center callers too. And the heroin/crack dealers. Not the users though.
t1_du57rsu	0	*	Except that press is lying. The US left have been railing against fox for years, but the moment the US conservatives do the same, it's fascism?
t1_du5696r	0	*	So how to be minority 101?

t1_dtblqi6	1	*	I meant you aren't weeding out Russian trolls so much as you are people who just make throwaways. My account is 7 days old. Lol
t1_dtcek4n	1	*	Im not talking about court though. I mean Trump could be hauled away in a striped suit and theyd still find a way to claim hes been framed by the deep state.
t1_dtbo5an	1	*	Maaan, Satan just didn't want to be part of (D) Gods establishment

t1_dtbl0u3	0	*	I was gonna say republicrats but I like repocrats better because the plan is to repossess the white house
t1_dtcg1bx	1	*	Pretty low bar you set there. There's only been, what, Duterte and Berlusconi that are/were worse and elected in legit elections?
t1_dtbmk9t	0	*	to paraphrase Confessions of an Economic Hitman, some businessperson decided one day that any action which led to growth was morally beneficial, and now 'heroes' run the game that is the USA
t1_dtbn4hj	1	*	When your rich they let you do it
t1_dtc63ot	1	*	Ofcourse, thanks anyways
t1_dtbk24j	0	*	Funny I didn't hear about this deep state business when Obama was president. If deep state is just the democratic party, then what is so deep about it?
t1_dtbck8y	0	*	Yea I think this article is framed to be more sensational then informative.
t1_dtbpv2j	0	*	tom hagen, where u at homez
t1_dtbmytt	1	*	I went in to get a capital one card, Citi card, bank of America etc etc etc. All involved only filling out a form online. No proof of income or anything else that's standard overseas. 
t1_dtbft42	0	*	What like a guy wearing a tan suit and using a slightly unusual mustard? How about a woman having somewhat toned upper arms? Or, better yet, how about the totally not made up sex slave colony on Mars?

t1_dtcgkdj	0	*	Guess what. It's gradually coming to light every single day why she hasn't been prosecuted. The wheel of justice grinds very slowly but thoroughly.
t1_dtbmf5l	0	*	And there you've assumed 2 things, which is part of my gripe. I'm all for calling Trump out, but there is just too much speculation here to be taken as truth. 
t1_dtcfnrq	1	*	Nothing against Canada. It's impressive their economy is as large as it is based on a population of like 40 people that are all maple syrup harvesting lumberjacks.
t1_dtblx6i	1	*	She will be president one day. Try and stop it.  spoilers: you can't. so take your little MAGA self on over to the losers circle.

t1_du2qxgc	1	*	Power bottom or total sub?
t1_du1nqwr	1	*	Nobody's saying we should ban posting roughly the same comment 3 times. Being progressive doesn't preclude thinking things are strange... Though I agree, not really that strange. Just a bit unusual.
t1_du1cu2h	1	*	All sack, no wack.

t1_dsppz52	1	*	it's more of a measure of how many commercials, previews of the coming segments, and recaps of the previous segment a fanbase can tolerate before it revolts.
t1_dsplrsf	1	*	Yeah, I was thinking what kind of fuckery did their government do to the stock exchange for the term floor to make sense. It was a few minutes before realization set in
t1_dspmxfy	0	*	Casualties, might refer to hurt feelings. Oh wait, people died.

t1_dt80hq8	1	*	They way he engineered the swing states in the USA for Trump and the asymmetrical warfare in Georgia/Ukraine indicate to me a very smart person. Is there a book you recommend on Putins past?
t1_dtwdwmt	1	*	Maybe, but no one worships them. Or says you are a bad person because they don't like what they did.

t1_dsd2tu4	1	*	Yeah well they can stil say I'm a proud Muslim or whatever and no problem. As long as they don't say they want to kill Westerners or blow things up, they can get around this great plan.

t1_dtic6ba	0	*	They were caught on the battlefield in Afghanistan - most of them.  I don't believe there's been any peace treaty yet with Al-Qaeda.  When there is, we can let them go.

t1_du66bo7	1	*	The weakest of retorts.
t1_du6d31r	1	*	Indeed, but I think there's a big difference between making a political statement that will not benefit them vs using slave labor or exploiting the tax system.

t1_ds8lupw	0	*	Can't you just foster a mutt from a kennel for a week or two to see if it works out? I don't know how common it is for shelters to let you do that, but that's what I did.
t1_dsa79un	1	*	Great quote. There almost isn't a single source of food we consume that hasn't been cultivated for thousands of years by genetic control.  
t1_ds8flxv	1	*	Perfect analogy U0001f604
t1_ds8joog	1	*	Me too.
t1_ds8ekj6	1	*	Theres a better way 
t1_ds8mzya	1	*	Yes, but you could just not breed dogs that way, and eliminate the problem entirely. Don't leave a dogs quality of life up to the lottery of having the right owner. 
t1_ds8silk	1	*	That's an issue with the process though that could be corrected. The same team of scientists could simply start out with 100x the original starting sample. 
t1_ds8m8x8	1	*	I know a lady who literally bought a retired Shepard from the police force. Yea, that worked about as well as expected.. He was re-homed within 2 weeks and she was down $10k.

t1_ds8q2xe	1	*	You sound as horrible as your choice of dog.   
t1_ds8z10w	1	*	my first thought of human genetic engineering is that it's going to create a genetic have - have-not system. and probably be the cause of a Gundam-esque war
t1_ds8kvf7	1	*	Your lack of logic is amazing to me. And you are trying to defend animal cruelty.
t1_ds8fzn6	1	*	African dogs, yes. Dingos, no. African dogs aren't a breed of dog, though. They are a different species that isn't even in the same genus.
t1_ds984ts	1	*	I don't personally breed dogs, no.
t1_ds8kpb8	0	*	Can you elaborate?
t1_ds8dofq	0	*	i absolutely do.  i am saying that  this notion of because we made a mistake, that we should just flat out make pugs extinct, is insane. 
t1_ds8lewm	1	*	I'm aware that they will. I'm not going to adopt one that is going to have those kinds of problems in <2 years, especially jumping through the ridiculous hoops the rescues in my area require.

t1_ds8m2v0	0	*	*Some* purebreeds. If you phrase it correctly, it's the truth. If you dont, it's a lie.
t1_ds9dfki	1	*	Fellow Canadian here. That was a really interesting video. Also, I really liked your photos. I figure they weren't really meant to be artistic but the shooter has a good eye. 
t1_ds8ls7v	1	*	Can't you tell by hanging out with a dog in a kennel or fostering it for a week or two whether you're allergic to it? Or whether it is hyperactive?  
t1_ds8g4w2	0	*	i respect your opinion (and can understand its merits) but there's nothing pseudo- about it
t1_ds8fjd5	1	*	I thought it may be charities. I'm also interested in where the puppies are sourced too.  Also, thanks for actually taking the time to understand my statements/questions. :)
t1_ds8k1qa	1	*	> Basically it was bred to have a skull too small for its brain.  This is my pet theory for why some breeds are overly aggressive.
t1_ds8dv9h	1	*	For some dogs it is
t1_ds8krs8	1	*	Absolutely 
t1_ds8q1e3	1	*	Yeah, there I agree with you.  I suspect they meant something more like 'helpless.'
t1_dsebe60	0	*	 But they're misleading stats that's all we were trying to say. No stats at all are better than stats that imply incorrect information.

t1_dszy15k	1	*	Lets not forget Podestas taste in art too.

t1_dtjlu8w	1	*	You're right about that. Maybe it's not in this comment string but I had just read a guy saying he was laying down at 3am with nobody around and an employee asked him not to.

t1_dtjjs5c	1	*	You did a perfectly adequate job of that yourself. 
t1_dtiw2rl	1	*	I wouldn't say that this state is *inherent* to human beings, but more that the way we thought about the world changed significantly once we stopped being tied to the land, and therefore the family. 
t1_dtjjr32	0	*	and food!  solve the hunger problem, *and* the homeless problem at once!!
t1_dtj74ex	0	*	I'm not at all authoritarian unless people are living on public money. You want freedom? get a job.

t1_dtjgwxm	0	*	I stand corrected. 
t1_dtj7n46	0	*	Using a public toilet means walking away from the crack pipe. Much easier just to shit nearby and get back to the drugs.
t1_dtixoa0	1	*	Yeah, no way I'd want someone with a probable history of drug and mental disorders moving into a free home next to mine.
t1_dtj3cyn	0	*	You expect me to agree with someone who pisses in shoes? Get outta here
t1_dtjbsir	0	*	Saying that because something has always existed it always has to is fallacious. We can always try to work towards eliminating awful things.
t1_dtixzft	1	*	Funny how people just want them to disappear when literally the whole idea behind homelessness is that they **don't** have anywhere to go, in the first place!
t1_dtj1dp3	0	*	The emphasis may be on downtown, as in do it someplace else. 
t1_dtivewt	0	*	And it sounds like you think parks are better used for adults to drink and use drugs than for children to have fun.  You know, homeless shelters are a thing.
t1_dtjngfu	0	*	It's not a reality, seeing as this is a very contentious issue with many intricacies. Your personal opinion is relative and not a definitive statement on the situation
t1_dtj0op1	0	*	And then we'd have a country littered with inexpensive mini-shelters...
t1_dtjh7gl	1	*	And then mulch them for crop fertilizer.
t1_dtiw3vl	1	*	Its crazy really.
t1_dtj15jm	1	*	You can get thrown in prison. By no means is it a foregone conclusion even if you have evaded taxes - the IRS wants their money and they won't get it with you in jail.
t1_dtjxbb7	1	*	There are a few things like ridiculous drinking laws though
t1_dtjkqwj	1	*	Well that's on you, the wall of porto potties lining the fence by the pool coupled with having witnessed multiple people just using the park made it pretty easy for me to believe
t1_dtj0lwj	1	*	Yes, that's clearly the only alternative.
t1_dtj23k2	1	*	Chill out.

t1_dtj2q0n	1	*	Well Id venture to say he has some superior qualities, and basic respect does not mean ignoring someones major faults that led them to the situation theyre in. 
t1_dtivoun	1	*	A real home does though. And when you live in a real home, you're far less likely to abuse drugs and alcohol. 
t1_dtj81u7	1	*	The people that love to eat them don't seem actually notice the smell.  My brother, for example, is totally unaffected by the smell, while I think they smell like a mixture of feces and death.

t1_dti13ko	0	*	Of course it does. 
t1_dthapfy	1	*	What about those that wave the confederate flag? Are they not dumb and racist? The hijab represents an oppressive religion regardless of if they have the choice to wear it or not.
t1_dthf4l5	1	*	Actions speak louder than words...
t1_dssa1o5	1	*	Hes saying a rising tide raises all ships, because the incredible increase in bitcoin value in the last 6 months has made people snap up graphics cards to mine other cryptos. 
t1_dstqfck	1	*	Yes I'm not disagreeing with that. I'm just saying that it has not managed to realize its vision and has been surpassed by better coins.
t1_dsswq7e	1	*	I upvoted you for your honesty.
t1_dst0nqk	1	*	You're right.  I'm cashing out right now and never reading or commenting ever again about crypto or bitcoin. Just like you.
t1_dsswrxy	0	*	Stating it over and over doesn't make it true. You aren't Trump like that.
t1_dta61ol	0	*	The Saud kingdom has always been a construct of foreign power.  By that metric, he would be unchallengeable.
t1_du73dmz	1	*	Dove unconscious into tank with sharks wearing lead boots trying to pull a Houdini
t1_dtow21f	0	*	I was thinking the senate is more likely to flip. Dems are only two seats from a majority. Not that the GOP would allow a Dem majority senate to accomplish anything.

t1_dus0g4w	0	*	Warm and wet here in Austin
t1_dtf8bi2	0	*	I'm aware of ninja edits.  I'm also aware that no one edits their post to complain about downvotes until after it's been downvoted. 
t1_dtfaytf	0	*	[Here's what I see.](https://i.imgur.com/NRgPNC3.png)  And yes I did ninja edit my post because it immediately started being downvoted.

t1_du6o8x9	0	*	I literally know people who experienced the Israel invasions, theft and murder firshand, I'm not looking at news channels.
t1_du6lzgt	0	*	The guy before me said  > Isreal, for better or for worse is not goin anywhere.  My metaphor was a reaction to that, so yeah I meant Isreal as the parasite.  
t1_du72f53	1	*	Oh okay, my bad. I still cant understand what you mean to say in your reply however.
t1_du6vdvp	0	*	What explosive?

t1_du6ofyf	1	*	Yes thought so. Its such sensationalist lies. 
t1_du85sva	1	*	I watched Memphis bell many times as a kid, only to later realize how propagandized bullshit it was.

t1_du6mdbf	1	*	Not this american. Fact is that they are effectively in less than stellar company historically with their current actions and behaviors, Bibi alone is just another shade of Putin...
t1_du7lyd4	1	*	Well its just a different viewpoint. He has a strong case as the older 1970 bill has never been over turned in the courts. I can see both sides. Personally  I am mostly neutral on the issue. 
t1_du6npq0	0	*	The ambassador is the representative of the country. Do you not understand this very simple fact?
t1_du6lr38	0	*	As someone who adores audio books, Vonnegut is definitely someone that benefits from careful reading.

t1_du6j1s8	0	*	You're pretty convinced of your position. Sounds like you have more than a dog in this fight mate. 
t1_du6z7ee	1	*	Mind bending.  This reminds me of a similar passage in the book 'Shibumi' (by Trevanian) where a shootout is described in reverse. 
t1_du72ahk	1	*	What? I didn't vote for the Likkud party, but I'm not the only one voting. You guys elected Trump, does that mean that every one of you holds the same beliefs that he does? 
t1_du6pvjn	0	*	Actually I don't mind people correcting me, patronizing or not, I might learn something. I know the difference between you're and your, just didn't notice it this time, to my great shame.
t1_du6zj3i	0	*	Not everyone read Vonnegut in HS as this very thread proves. For schools that did read Vonnegut, it wasnt always slaughterhouse 5. My school had us read Cats Cradle for instance.

t1_ds1nvo7	1	*	You may not be aware but Germany has just passed an anti-hate-speech law that is much more general than just anti-Hitler. FB/YT/etc are required to comply.
t1_dteve3u	1	*	When Egypt and Jordan invent a time machine and undo their attempt at a 2nd holocaust. 
t1_due6akz	0	*	> I don't want handouts at all  Then  > I'd be happy to have theirs as well  You're not even consistent within a single comment. You want handouts, but like to pretend you don't. 
t1_due4v6h	1	*	You under estimate my lack of caring what people think about me.  And I live in the real world not one based on feelings.  
t1_due168o	0	*	You are clearly not an economist.
t1_due434q	1	*	Also, most, if not all, states have a gas tax for roads. 
t1_due66so	1	*	The problem is the very richest are getting a much bigger cut, and when this bill trashes the US economy and it's harder for everybody an extra $70 a check seems like a silly trade off. 
t1_duo70c2	1	*	oh well i guess thats not such a problem then

t1_ds1g1j1	1	*	Trump... complains. He blusters and shouts and his supporters mistake it for leadership.
t1_ds1ejjb	0	*	> The problem with that logic is America stirred the pot, now America needs to stay until there is lasting peace.  Like Iraq?
t1_ds1gbam	0	*	No, it's not. The Muslims genocidally ruled India for 800 years and then the British rule was basically 200 years.
t1_ds34xrz	0	*	You do know that hes not the first president to call them out on their shit? But you give Trump shit?  Talk about ignorance 
t1_ds1hefi	1	*	wat

t1_ds1kd6n	0	*	Who exactly do you think was behind the USAs Vietnam? The North Vietnamese werent exactly invading and murdering South Vietnamese on their own. 
t1_ds2ur1q	0	*	You're proving my point, child. 
t1_ds2hcnf	1	*	I think the real fear is that he could stumble into it. Anything beyond that sounds hyperbolic, but that's enough of a real concern.

t1_ds1nk71	0	*	Build that straw man.
t1_ds1ggzt	0	*	Afghanistan is landlocked and the most reasonable direction to run a pipeline is through Pakistan. China would also be interested but that would only be for the Chinese market.

t1_ds1jdoi	1	*	http://www.dw.com/en/report-german-spy-agency-gave-us-information-on-osama-bin-laden-whereabouts/a-18454653  Seems the CIA had suspicions, the german BND then had a informant that confirmed this. 
t1_ds2jvsj	0	*	You are right but Talibans were at different level of brutality. There is lot of grey in Afghani politics. I really respect Lion of Panjshir, Late Ahmad Shah Massoud though

t1_ds1lo3b	1	*	> such a poor idea.  I think I'd personally use the term *short-sighted idea*. It worked great, but came back to haunt us badly.
t1_ds1ez6k	0	*	It's almost as if you need to identify a problem before you can work on fixing it.
t1_ds1h6vv	1	*	because humanitarian reasons can benefit the US. it is never for charity.
t1_ds1gtai	1	*	Lol wat
t1_ds1ewhy	1	*	we've pretty much done that around the world

t1_ds1g6n2	0	*	Honestly, I think he'd try to spin it to make himself look good. Look at how awful it is now! Cutting aid was the right move! We're no longer supporting this.
t1_ds1r4rf	1	*	Ooh thats fast.
t1_ds1tn9x	1	*	This is it! If the military thinks it will get less money or have to be downsized in anyway, they'll resist like mules!  Just like Ike said..

t1_ds1ionn	0	*	The only campaign promise he's kept is cutting some regulations.

t1_du23qgf	1	*	It looks Finnish to me.
t1_du13hbn	1	*	Huh, this is a good point, but even the UN estimated that 500 Hezbollah fighters lost their lives during the war... which makes Hezbollah's claim less likely.

t1_dtpstsx	1	*	I got the one year plan and it came off in one payment and I can't remember there being an option to change to monthly payments.  I think you get a better deal because they get all the money upfront.

t1_dssre1b	1	*	The waste of time was the time your parents spent conceiving you or the time the scientists grew you from bread mold 
t1_dsqc4oa	1	*	Why not just take neither side and wait until an investigation is complete? If person X accused stone_opera of raping them, I should believe person X because they're the alleged victim in this case?
t1_dsmxjng	0	*	It literally does until you put in some legwork and find more evidence to disprove it. This is actually, ACTUALLY how logic works in society.
t1_dsnjvyo	0	*	Brain washing is child abuse.

t1_du2zxz0	1	*	Hmm.  Maybe it wasn't?  I feel like it was.  But I don't have any data to back that up so I won't claim to be sure. 
t1_du31w07	0	*	Thats not why people fear flying though.   Its because in the event of a plane crash youre basically fucked. You have no control.

t1_du2wkqx	1	*	You chose the wrong week to quit sniffing glue.

t1_duq900c	1	*	Everything being discussed in this sub is because of conservative leadership...

t1_duq8th3	1	*	The problem is there isn't an alternative to having one nation dominate others that is good. You either swap who the big guy is or you get the worst case scenario, competing powers.

t1_dsozcoy	1	*	Is that how morality works? Once you've stomped everyone down and gotten your great big stash of gold, you can just pay off your past sins? Sounds a lot like indulgences. 
t1_dsolvr5	1	*	That makes you like the rest if us. 
t1_dsp0qs8	0	*	Man bill is the king. He deserves every fuckin penny he has. What he brought us was/is revolutionary. He is not a dictator and he didn't steal from anyone.

t1_dsl7ogp	0	*	Given how Putin seems willing to use lethal force against political opponents, Id be totally cool with getting this treatment. Its not professional, but it beats a bullet/beating/poisoning death.

t1_du7bcom	0	*	Don't know, he made Russia relevant again through geopolitical games. He's certainly one of the brightest.
t1_dsgmz7m	1	*	No, they don't. Evidence: If you don't teach people about this bullshit, they won't believe it.
t1_dshl0cu	1	*	What criticisms could they possibly debunk? It's Islam. It's *all* bunk...

t1_ds7yhyj	0	*	Leave it to reddit to tell Iranians who they are.
t1_ds7vz3q	1	*	They don't want to admit it's Iran because it's a proxy war and admitting that they recognize it's Iran means they have to do something about it. Think in terms of realpolitik.
t1_ds856fe	1	*	I said that some Iranians are like that. Which is a pretty indisputable fact.

t1_dt3s2fy	0	*	At his orangest, look at the contrast between the skin immediately around his eyes and the rest of him. Doesn't take any manipulation to see the man loves himself a good spray tan.

t1_dscqnkw	1	*	Lol thats not what I meant
t1_dse00fo	1	*	>  The tax bill will only effect your withholdings/return for 2018.  Yeah, which means people will start seeing more money on each paycheck, since there will be less withheld. 
t1_dsfv5l6	0	*	I'm not a fan either. I was mocking him and should've put an /s. Apologies.

t1_dsdoxtk	1	*	Yes and making $8,000 yearly is middle class. My 30k makes me a millionaire.  
t1_dscu6q0	0	*	Youre right people will find another way if theyre determined, but its important to note that suicide by gun takes much less planning and has a much higher success rate than other methods
t1_dscs60s	0	*	> wage slavery  Is it wage slavery when these factories pay significantly more than minimum wage? And much better conditions than local employers?
t1_dscw664	0	*	Fuck financials. I couldnt cope *mentally* with that.

t1_dt10xhz	1	*	Not true at all
t1_du92s39	1	*	> Pakistan did inform US intelligence that he was there.  Source?  And it better not be that one Pakistani guy that's already been discredited multiple times.
t1_dt1zmxo	1	*	No, no, mon frere, this is my middle finger.

t1_dsrxbgp	0	*	What about wind?
t1_durqe63	0	*	No, it isn't.  These people are perfectly aware of these taxes, and voting *in favor of them.*  It might be the first time in US history that people are in favor of being taxed on something.
t1_durr3g5	1	*	You have to go to a specific store to get liquor in Pennsylvania. You can get beer at alot of grocery stores but I think that only recently became an option. 
t1_ds36yjg	0	*	NATO was dying until the recent Russian aggression.

t1_duyicz2	1	*	No he didnt
t1_duynd6d	0	*	Thats only one piece of the puzzle  The fucking president made deals with a foreign power to become president.  Why is that so hard to comprehend with over three years of stories? 
t1_duzqm2o	1	*	And employees are not the same thing as friends. It was such a bad analogy lmao
t1_duymf36	1	*	I remember when people said Bush would never get a second term
t1_duyn24h	0	*	Trump does. A lot.  A I'm going to deny reality on my first day in office and demand you do the same lot. 
t1_duylpv0	1	*	Right, it is unfair that one side upholds morals and the other shits all over them.     But that's the price you pay for having standards and sticking to them.

t1_duz1t18	1	*	Ah, I see where this is going. This is bait, designed to bring insults in reply so you can get peopled kicked of /r/worldnews. 
t1_duyxzik	1	*	Too coherent for trump to be honest. How can you expect him to even somewhat stay on topic for a whole paragraph.
t1_duyvwnu	0	*	We'll need 2/3 of the Senate vote in order to remove him from Office. If Republicans continue to vote along party lines then we're shit out of luck.
t1_duyu9f4	1	*	I just hope you're being glib.  If not then at least these people can get a taste of some authentic anti-american sentiment. 
t1_duylil2	0	*	So... you're saying they aren't stupid. But they did vote for an obviously lying rich narcissist over someone offering incremental improvements? B just sounds like a long winded way of saying A.
t1_duykmpr	1	*	 Well kudos to you for ruining history in the future. Which is a weird statement.  But hey, you're the one with the picture on the wall and the rest of us are just PlagueFire Victims.

t1_duz6oix	0	*	I was making fun of Trump looking super orange in some pictures, but i guess  it was a terrible joke lol
t1_duyo89e	1	*	I wouldnt doubt that. He has always had the money and willingness to destroy peoples lives over petty disagreements. Sociopaths with money. Never a good mix.
t1_duypva9	1	*	No, you didnt but the person above that you are defending did.
t1_duzbrko	1	*	that mental image will last with me for quite some time.  thanks for the laugh!

t1_duymczi	0	*	Which courts said Hillary committed a crime?
t1_duymj4g	0	*	Not sure, I'm not intimately familiar with his life before being POTUS.  Maybe he has an open relationship with Melania. Isn't that something liberals love? Polyamory and all that degenerate stuff?

t1_duz15n7	0	*	Sure if he is exposed and indicted which he won't be.  By your logic the Clintons, until that happens, are more crooked than Trump.  And I agree.
t1_duyw7oa	1	*	If by /r you mean Russian shill than yes.
t1_duynjz5	1	*	Lol if anyone runs for state wide office in the Northeast as a Team Trump politician theyd be lucky if they even got on the ballot.

t1_du8rr87	1	*	Go google how any ISRAELI trucks bring aid into israel.
t1_du8lu67	1	*	Easy way to get it lifted.   Btw Egypt and The Palestinian Authority help Israel enforce the blockade. Part of the sea blockade is actually enforced by Egypt. 
t1_dujcpu2	1	*	No, the nation of Israel was created when Arabs couldn't stop spontaneously attacking Jewish refugees forcing the UN to create the partition plan.

t1_dsfjte4	1	*	Also the fact that most younger people's experience with capitalism consists of the great recession and extreme and still rising income inequality. Kind of puts a bad taste in your mouth
t1_dsfnnu4	0	*	well still it shoulda been released like around November 1st 2016 at least. common sense shoulda also said Russian mafia might start killing folks over it so put them under witness protection.

t1_du4kwvc	1	*	Nobody is arguing the bail skipping is lawful (though some might argue it's a waste of resources to still pursue it). They're free to pursue him for that. That's not the issue. 
t1_dtb9vg7	0	*	That must be why we're still there.
t1_dtvuhqu	0	*	Copyright laws are *much* worse in the US because of how our legal system works. It's much easier for large companies to engage in spurious lawsuits over here. 
t1_duhbgrs	1	*	So... I guess you don't like Berlin?
t1_dug5kt0	1	*	Diesel vehicles that are good at avoiding emissions tests and that are tested on primates?
t1_duhdixq	1	*	That was beautiful :,)
t1_duhfpm3	1	*	holy fuck YES
t1_duh4s34	0	*	Huh, how interesting.
t1_duhcj57	1	*	https://imgur.com/a/v5QR8
t1_dugfisq	0	*	Read: Shit like the article that made this very thread.
t1_dujo4ls	0	*	You dont do military classes, normal HS curriculum but with physical training and discipline and boarding school rules. no weapon or combat training.
t1_dtqd1l7	1	*	In his defense, I doubt he could find his way out of a box. My cat can barely do it.
t1_dtqhh6f	1	*	Damn where I live, it's a deal to get 2 yella belly tall boys for $5. 
t1_ds8rpkq	0	*	When it comes to political rights it's necessitated. 
t1_ds8kszb	0	*	So, if we simply removed Israel and the jews from Palestine and created a democratic and advanced Palestine that would be good too?  Good to know.
t1_ds9fi7z	1	*	Yerp
t1_ds8kt9j	0	*	You're probably right, but isn't that who you want in the military if you're an imperial military power? 
t1_ds8x2ni	1	*	Show where I said they didn't?
t1_ds8it5u	1	*	The US does have the habit of instilling a temporarily Pro-US dictator if said democracy isn't a pro-US democracy though.
t1_ds8wxvn	1	*	That doesn't mean it's correct, no matter which political party is pushing the foreign policy. 
t1_duo1bbj	0	*	On, shit like this it would be best not to include any images or pictures and still include the story with details changed to conceal her identity or ability of regime to identify her further. 
t1_dspedep	1	*	Lol ok. I thought it would be obvious to most. 
t1_dsqx7rd	1	*	That's why I'm doubting this weapon has been deployed at all. The Russians aren't crazy nihilsitic enough to risk so much. Same for the U.S.    
t1_dsp759x	1	*	lol what do you think
t1_dss84kz	1	*	Russia and the US were two countries that didnt abandon their nuclear programs. Not all did, but a lot did.
t1_dsqnyyc	1	*	Fucking hell, man... this shit is scary. Thanks for explaining, though!  It was a great explanation, and I understand much better now :) 
t1_dsp2eyf	0	*	Was successfully shot down by British Sea Dart missiles during the gulf war, moments before impacting it's target, the USS Missouri. 
t1_dsq0kqe	1	*	Hmm. Very true. 
t1_dspuqrp	1	*	I think it was supposed to be an analogy, or metaphor, either way, whoosh.
t1_dsosvmz	0	*	Since you are ok with Cuba I want my Jupiter missles back in Turkey.
t1_dspgvqr	0	*	Its a real shame that we tested shit loads of nukes before drones and 4k cameras
t1_dsp7w7y	1	*	Unless they are a lunatic with a god complex.
t1_dsowvsf	0	*	carriers have no defense against standard ballistic missiles, a simple barrage will easily overwhelm its defense,    
t1_dsp6osd	1	*	Its run by stable geniuses!
t1_dsp9j9s	1	*	> The Chinese kill-chain is still not advanced enough to effectively find a CSG on the open ocean, and get a DF-21 to connect.  They have satellites and the wakes are visible from space.  
t1_dspnn0r	1	*	Hey who invited Lithium-6?!
t1_dspgbpe	1	*	It does not provide a rosy outlook for our future.
t1_dspcubk	0	*	Air isn't flammable. Striking a really really big match isn't going to change that. If it were able to change that, some volcano or meteor would have ignited it long ago.
t1_dspes8h	0	*	Yeah, well, if that's your only input, you don't have a very robust classifier. If it takes into account other features in its assessment, it might classify the official signals as anomalous.
t1_dsopfsz	0	*	Too many good lines in that movie.
t1_dsow26a	1	*	Sorry.   
t1_dsp6lnt	1	*	Nah.  
t1_dsp91wj	1	*	Mein Fuhrer, I can walk!
t1_dsp2snj	0	*	Fire ze missiles!
t1_dsp68n9	1	*	Makes no difference in this context.
t1_dspl6ix	0	*	No, I think in this case god, or whomever else you want to attribute the universe to, is the one to take the credit.  The engineers have to put a lot of work in, to get it to explode at all.
t1_dspwxqx	1	*	I mixed up some of the numbers. It smashed windows up to 900 miles away  http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Russia/TsarBomba.html 
t1_dsp5ksk	1	*	To add to what u/pressmorebuttons said, we also deployed Genie nuclear air-to-air missiles. 
t1_dsp3rhb	1	*	This is absolutely mind blowing and awe inspiring
t1_dspbb1g	1	*	How the fuck do you lose sight of a carrier?
t1_dspukcj	1	*	 Interesting. I wouldnt have thought the water would absorb enough to make a difference.    Could they theoretically park it near the shoreline and beach it just before detonation?
t1_dsp84qv	0	*	Wait...who is that guy? Because that sounds very wrong. That's like a Chixculub asteroid sized wave. This is massive by bomb standards but still peanuts compared to Chixculub.
t1_dsp2zqi	0	*	Sunburns have shit range and can be targeted by shipborn awacs. Don't kid yourself.
t1_dsp9xh8	1	*	Of course, it must be a team of drillers.  Because we all know teaching austronauts how to drill is so much harder than teaching a bunch of redneck drillers *actual fucking rocket science*.
t1_dspekmf	1	*	so essentially we get 2 of these 100mt bombs and we have a krakatoa...  
t1_dsphvk6	1	*	Or they weren't told.
t1_dspeajn	1	*	Thank you for explaining! Could you please describe the difference between this new weapon and a nuclear-tipped torpedo though? They sound like the same thing to me.
t1_dspa0ym	1	*	A surprise to be sure
t1_dsq97cp	0	*	Then how the hell do we make nukes stop existing? As long as they exist, someone will use them eventually, and then everyone dies.
t1_dsou68r	0	*	They don't *have* to, but the passengers enjoy it better than when they plow into the ground.
t1_dspcjoz	1	*	What an eco-friendly apocalypse.
t1_dsp2o43	1	*	Poetic.
t1_dtu0yc5	0	*	They wouldn't waste the electricity.  It is a finite resource.  But, whatever you choose to believe.  
t1_dsrr9mg	1	*	Nope, 2 solid losers right there.
t1_dsrr9mh	1	*	Well, considering children are already eating cow diarrhea i wouldn't be so hopeful
t1_dsrm97l	1	*	This is all just so confusing
t1_dsrntj0	0	*	Yeah and 2.5 million Americans die per year which is about 10% of the population of the DPRK, whats your point?
t1_dsrq3dr	1	*	Yeah, too early for me in the morning.
t1_dsrn3kk	1	*	Oh I see what you mean now. Either way I think the main point is don't applaud the guy.
t1_dsrzlfa	1	*	The report on NorKo smartphones is that they all have app encryption that makes users feel more secure in their treasonous ways. Same phones as us but oddly no Wifi capabilities.
t1_dss1372	1	*	You don't know me.
t1_dsrrf1g	1	*	For that, 4 grams of shrooms each would be better. They'd be bawling their eyes out and signing agreement after agreement. :)
t1_dsrlzyd	0	*	Oh right  Well not editing that now I deserve the shame
t1_dsrnboc	0	*	Winning against someone who got more votes than you in the only round of voting there was makes absolutely zero sense. 
t1_dsrw214	1	*	I get what you're saying and kinda agree. I just get  triggered when people start saying things like Kim is being rational etc. At least I can admit that haha
t1_dss2awp	1	*	> are we watching the same news headlines?  I found the root of your TDS.
t1_dss3g3k	1	*	Wrong!
t1_dsrnszf	0	*	Hitler likes dogs. I don't agree with Hitler nor would I voice ant opinion that aligned me as such.  I like dogs.
t1_dsrqv6s	1	*	Why is he a sociopath? He actually believes what he says 
t1_dsrpyue	0	*	Theres a comment further up calling him the voice or reason in this exchange.
t1_dsrrcos	0	*	Right. I'm sure your argument won't involve semantics, or be disingenuous at all, but fire away...
t1_dss7ajt	1	*	He timed his stroke to the beat of the EKG
t1_dsrwmcy	1	*	The amount of resolve and determination is off the charts.
t1_dssgd9o	0	*	You have to admire the amount of balls it takes to call someone else's information source bad when you're too fucking embarrassed to admit where you get yours.
t1_dss40m6	0	*	Yup

t1_dsrssw8	1	*	What are you doing now? Your upset obviously. You replied. My point exactly. 
t1_dsrqfwh	0	*	The US government is and should be held to a higher standard than that of North Korea.

t1_dss98aa	0	*	> my argument is CNN, MSN, ABC doing multi-day front page coverage of it.  Your argument is retarded because that never happened. 
t1_dsruql7	1	*	Mrow! :3
t1_dsrrt0a	0	*	Is this a real comment? Like actually your firmly held belief? Or are you just typing away at work or something. 
t1_dsry9az	1	*	Man you really havent been paying attention the last 2 years.

t1_dsrz91f	0	*	Damn, the Russians and Trumpets are out in force today manipulating the votes on anyone accusing Trump of mental illness.
t1_dsrqp1x	1	*	If it's a good shot, how will the US military-industrial complex profit from the rebuilding of SK...?
t1_dsroadu	0	*	The alternative is continuous internecine conflict.

t1_dsl87uw	0	*	Actually I think it is Homeless Deathspot
t1_dslasda	1	*	That's not what this person in the interview seemed to believe. 
t1_dsm2cxu	0	*	Fair enough  and what about doing away with districts altogether?
t1_dsl2m4h	1	*	Have they never heard of The Final Cut? Rogers/Floyd *spent an entire album whining about margaret thatcher*
t1_dsky845	1	*	Perhaps because the manufactured outrage just doesn't map to reality that well :)
t1_dsnpq7z	0	*	Are you actually trying to say something here?
t1_dsl397z	0	*	When did I say anything of the sort? I just said that looking at TV viewership is not painting an accurate picture of the conservative media machine. 
t1_dsl98np	0	*	And letting those people in back then turned out pretty good for America.
t1_dsl39hx	1	*	Jesus Christ. Youre so right on with that description.   My heart breaks for my two young sons. We are not leaving a positive legacy for our younger generations. 
t1_dsl031v	1	*	nah, i got it.  he was using it incorrectly. he wasn't being sarcastic, he actually was proving OP's point. Republican calling basic facts 'opinions.'
t1_dslg527	1	*	Performance art describes American politics perfectly 
t1_dsl1fvn	0	*	So you don't have anything positive to present, and are just shifting the goalpost to keep pretending everyone is against you and 'both sides' must be the same?

t1_dslditn	1	*	I agree with you there. 
t1_dslbnaq	0	*	Well, no, I didn't make the original claims, I was replying to your comment. I was hoping to have a discussion with you, but you've unfortunately proven that as something beyond you. 
t1_dsky9qr	1	*	Just like the Y'allqueda of the south is too.  They are really fucking similar, just call god a different name.  Edit: spelling

t1_dsll6qh	0	*	> f***      You wouldn't talk that way around your grandmother would you young man?
t1_dsl9xbh	1	*	Exactly. The literal answer to Trump's question is Because those people already live in countries that are better than the US in pretty much every way and have no desire to emigrate to it.
t1_dskywxo	1	*	His commitment to McDonald's is about as impressive as Grant's commitment to cigars.  Just a matter of time.

t1_dundup2	0	*	I did not, what is it?
t1_dum8bta	1	*	2 weeks, sure. I'm not convinced the squirrels will survive the nuclear winter either
t1_dulo377	0	*	That's a fairly different situation. Beggars in all countries turn into assholes when someone they perceive as well off doesn't give them money.  
t1_dulyduy	1	*	Kinda. Thatcher certainly did.
t1_dumqsez	1	*	But Kissinger killed more with carpet bombing.
t1_dulvy77	1	*	Being the first black president
t1_dumpd7q	0	*	Yeah I def would say theyre super carriers. They do the same job as the us super carriers, the lack of catobar isnt a huge deal really
t1_dun0eag	1	*	Still blows my mind that (if I'm not misremembering) the US has more carriers than the entirety of the rest of the world.
t1_dulln0a	0	*	I was more referring to the leadership, who was far far more ideology oriented. We all know Hitlers underlings and generals were far more logical and even, sometimes, humane than the Furher himself.
t1_dulla0j	1	*	mmm seems I was half correct.
t1_dt6co10	1	*	Why has it taken over 120 years for America to integrate Spanish into their system? Its easier to learn and its spoken by more people across the globe. 
t1_dt8nue1	0	*	And it's possible that they are, but the family is claiming otherwise so they don't have to go back.

t1_dua61tv	1	*	With certain emphasizing caps thrown in
t1_dua66rh	1	*	I think it's more a case of that seems to be more regulation than most non-US citizens seem to think is in place. Especially since the you can buy guns at walmart anecdote is so regularly touted.   
t1_duamjxx	1	*	Except that the intention of a car, the reason it is manufactured, is to travel from A to B, the main purpose of a gun is to shoot holes in people
t1_dua7alc	1	*	True.
t1_dua58ms	1	*	It's really hard to say but they usually are a bit disconnected from their peers and a lot of them seem to have not so great home lives.
t1_dua5zvl	0	*	You could make this argument against plainclothes police as well, though.   You'd need positive identity of the target before you shoot.
t1_dua61vo	1	*	Blatantly wrong. If you go to a gun show any of the dealers will hand you a background check sheet. Refuse this and you will not be taking any firearms home.
t1_duc3upj	1	*	That's the right wing. 
t1_dua5eqq	0	*	> It's just how he feels man  America.
t1_dua8skr	1	*	That was exactly my point. Can't give support to the mentally ill, we might be forced to improve the lives of the poor.
t1_duafire	1	*	Even if it's not false equivalence (which it is by the way), your facts are incorrect.  in 2014 the gun death rate was the same as car death rate (10.3 per 100,000).  
t1_ds7t5y2	0	*	Nothing of what we know about how life developed on Earth is random. There's little reason to expect that what we don't yet know will turn out to be random.

t1_dsceiss	0	*	Allowing slavery is not exclusive to Islam.
t1_dscxkzi	0	*	Communism for example was atheistic, didn't stop millions of people of dying. Mao's great leap forward for example killed almost 60 million

t1_dscueto	1	*	As opposed to Christian nations, who never engaged in imperialism and the expansion of their borders.
t1_dsd3e1r	0	*	>I don't think Europe is under threat of being conquered by an Arabic nation.  Europeans could be under threat of demographic displacement, however. The end result would essentially be the same.

t1_dsceuv8	0	*	The year was 2014; you see the date on one of the magazines early on in the movie. Being able to recall this makes me believe I have watched it too many times.
t1_dsdg8o3	1	*	my point exactly. 
t1_dscf24p	1	*	its almost like its about non-white people as much as it about muslims leading your point not to matter

t1_dsd8kcb	0	*	I like that you're willing to claim they are scum and disgusting without knowing anything about them beyond that they dislike you.  Cool, cool, totally rational.
t1_dscel41	0	*	You don't care, but that works only until your neighbor starts to care about your religion. We should not tolerate intolerant religions.

t1_dthga1e	0	*	I don't know any of the people who would do that, therefore I cannot provide meaningful insight into what their intent might be.   That's no excuse to project my insecurities unto them though.

t1_dupjuoe	0	*	I'm not calling the entire society socialist.  But the means of production in the healthcare market is regulated by socialist means. That's socialism.
t1_dupnmp9	0	*	Then they meddled in Donetsk. 
t1_dupqrh2	1	*	Well, this were just the numbers. I agree that there is no comparison between murder and desease related deaths.
t1_duq7k7y	1	*	Sure
t1_dus1avs	1	*	Oh damn ty.  Oh and btw thanks for not just attacking me and actually replying. As the former is far more common in reddit, rather than the latter.

t1_dur1d49	0	*	I get that, but I really don't understand why you say The US has the better benefits.
t1_dupkpo3	0	*	Because of America. If America scales back its budget, European countries will have to increase theirs to compensate.
t1_dupkcnv	0	*	The recent tax cut certainly doesn't help.  Additional $1.5 trillion to the deficit over 10 years.
t1_dupxmeu	0	*	Wait so just showing up at a booth and ticking a box is enough to vote? No ID, passport or anything else is checked?
t1_dur3yge	1	*	Oh, well I stand corrected.

t1_dupi4ws	1	*	This was the most delightful lesson ever
t1_dupr76r	1	*	Which is not a problem. Because they didn't need it.
t1_dupkec2	1	*	Fib in English has a lighthearted connotation. A white lie or harmless joke.   Lxfcgen means to deliberately falsify/fabricate. Now famously made known by the term lxfcgenpresse, fake news.

t1_dt6t52w	1	*	So if I criticise atheists in anyway despite not being religious Im automatically wrong because Xkcd says so. Makes sense.
t1_dt6j5cl	1	*	Kids hanging themselves because they believe that what they feel is bad paints a picture that it's not completely different. They don't hang themselves because they are accepted and loved.

t1_dugtaax	0	*	It's not just easier, it's also the position that lets people in power stay in power.  Don't blame us, it was *them.* is one of the things that never changes, no matter which party is in charge.
t1_dugubdo	1	*	Thanks Trump.
t1_dugvi9t	0	*	Which is fucking sickening.  POS lied you into war without end.
t1_duhvhtv	0	*	It's still for selfish reasons. If she wasnt getting credit for it or publicity/political clout she wouldn't bother. 
t1_dugrjio	1	*	People didnt like hillary because of the things she said... why are you being so condescending then saying the exact same thing the other dude said?   
t1_dugzh96	1	*	And the fact that people think Clinton isn't anti-superpredator.
t1_dugw6to	1	*	All work and no pope makes spicy a dead boy. 
t1_dugs6xt	1	*	Well.. maybe not Bernie.
t1_dugqrsq	0	*	I said nothing about who I vote for. I'm talking about minority vs majority problems. Don't be so emotional
t1_dugtf0v	0	*	the point is, calling them Top U.S. Official sounds serious to the masses, whereas naming the particular democrat senator that's calling them out isn't news at all.
t1_dugsjl6	1	*	People in states with larger populations are getting screwed over with our current system. Smaller states are being over represented with the current electoral system. 
t1_dugy9nx	0	*	As an American, ignore him please. 
t1_duh3ili	1	*	First, Obama did NOT have a supermajority.  Fuck that narrative.  https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/1929869
t1_duht337	1	*	How was Sanders objectively better than Clinton?
t1_dugqgmb	1	*	The electoral college system is a huge part of that disinterest and apathy, so no wonder they don't want to get rid of it. 
t1_dugvm72	0	*	Really? I thought they were long lived early men. Cool to know.
t1_dugt83d	0	*	What system would solve that problem without amounting to majoritarian hegemony?
t1_dugxvnv	1	*	With American made brushes and soap. 
t1_dugr5co	1	*	> Maybe trying to checkmate the electorate into voting for an unpopular candidate was a bad idea?   unpopular?  she won both popular votes
t1_dugsaj4	1	*	 >Foreign interference is not anything new. Look at how ~~China~~ **USA** influenced [insert any of large number of nations] elections.  FTFY   
t1_duguykv	0	*	lol fucking pleb. follow your democratic masses. call twitter the devil. turn around and hail FDR for using radio.  pathetic.   You area all just as bad as the Republicans. 
t1_duh5x99	0	*	Yeah, that is true. Admittedly, I hear a lot of Dads talking about how they love their daughters and I totally understand it's not a sexual thing in most contexts lol
t1_duh9u0i	1	*	Because it's not like there's any economic impact from having the UK leave the EU our anything...
t1_dugs1xp	1	*	Not quite, I'd say. I mean I think you would come up with a different number that 3 million (and 65.8 million).   Adding it together I get 32.7 Clinton voters in states where Trump won. 
t1_dugoblm	0	*	Stupid is as stupid does. 
t1_dugra1w	0	*	Could you elaborate on what you actually saw? Not doubting you, just curious.
t1_dugxjng	1	*	Check out [Brazil's anthem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxLEvDig9Do), I really like it.
t1_dugt38b	1	*	How big do you think NYC and LA actually are? 20% of the nation? 30%? 50%?  Try 4%. 
t1_duh0lhu	1	*	Okay, but this is anecdotal evidence. Until we know for a fact that most people didn't vote because they actively chose not to, I think it best we reserve judgement until we get the full picture.
t1_dugsz2e	1	*	On the one hand, void beasts. On the other hand, Trump.  All hail the void!
t1_dugthlu	0	*	...but not all assholes are equal.
t1_duhqokw	1	*	Well, only 16 million voted for Clinton in the primary.  So at least a bit portion, including me. 
t1_dugrs1q	0	*	I completely forgot how Texas, the second largest state in the union, is a liberal hellhole. I also forgot the Senate doesn't actually exist.
t1_ds8uuhc	0	*	Reloading means you are *interrupting* a fire order so that can resume firing.  Ceasing fire means that you no longer wish to attack something.
t1_dtun7zb	0	*	There's an optimum level of competition, anything above or below that becomes inefficient. 
t1_du6dxix	0	*	But its not the same as old growth. 
t1_dt2qkcl	0	*	Most firearm suicides are accomplished with guns fired at point blank range. There's enough energy from a point blank shot to create an exit wound.
t1_dt2q12z	1	*	That's why I said on paper. And still, that is a shit ton of money, even for the super rich.
t1_dtlgc0k	1	*	To be fair, that was a cargo ship. I'm not sure how else you expect to move that stuff from North America to Europe at that point in time.
t1_dtldmdz	1	*	Portable nuclear reactors are a thing 
t1_dtnbk0q	1	*	Oh! Ok! Well I hope you have a good day Burger Boss!
t1_dtlt1eh	0	*	Irrelevant in modern naval warfare. Because 700 miles before you came within your 100 mile effective range your railgun ship was sunk by aircraft loaded with missiles with a much longer range. 
t1_duvtlrj	0	*	This is fucking false.  Debt is absolutely a valuable resource that can be refined for Vespene gas. 
t1_dtvxz1p	1	*	You should try reading the article before making up facts and then claiming they are in said article.  
t1_dtvcdvq	0	*	You don't know the details, yet totally agree. Nice.
t1_dtvue44	1	*	Fantastic point. Its not rape if you refuse to acknowledge the rape. Thats morally right. Fuck Islamic rule. 
t1_dubzofx	1	*	I think you forgot to take your meds today.
t1_due55gc	1	*	Ok, then expect retaliation. China joined the WTO and in doing so accepted a framework of rules in order to get access to foreign markets. They're not living up to their end of the deal. 
t1_ducb4e2	1	*	There was no proof anything was wrong with the meat. They just didn't want it.
t1_duc8g3d	1	*	Yes they are, that's the point, agh.
t1_dubzg0p	0	*	Because you clearly have none.
t1_dud4uf2	0	*	It is monumentally stupid. That's my point. Just like it's monumentally stupid to say these companies are somehow 'forced' to do business in China.
t1_duc02jc	1	*	Wheres your evidence for they do.  You cant just say stuff like that and not back it up. 
t1_duc96t6	1	*	Lag
