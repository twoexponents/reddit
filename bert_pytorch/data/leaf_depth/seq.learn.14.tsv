t1_dtbyft0	0	*	We're talking about the 737.  No single aisle can have a composite fuselage like the 787.  It just not as efficient at that size   
t1_dtc1q1f	1	*	And Bombardier had the same plans, there is nothing different or out of place between what the 2 companies had planned. 
t1_duaqas4	0	*	Nice of you to change it from American.
t1_dua6agn	0	*	Sorry I decided I don't have the effort to answer and debate your questions, it's too much effort. Bye!
t1_dtleu8q	1	*	glad we agree.
t1_dtloh4g	0	*	Yep. They got an ambulance out and they somehow managed to deal with it. Seems like its a fairly common occurrence 
t1_dtmjmjl	1	*	Very true but have you ever tried to cut a pill like that? These were specific prescribed directions from the doctor albeit more than 10 years ago.
t1_dtlwigg	0	*	They're actually trying to regulate immodium now. Put it in a pill instead of a bottle to control dosing. I guess some opiate users were drinking it like water and developed heart problems. Its crazy 
t1_dtmjicf	0	*	Can you imagine the commerce the canal would bring?
t1_dtlw73b	0	*	Agreed but shit like this is what the Conservatives are going to use for character assassination and rustle up support in rural areas.
t1_dtllto8	0	*	Getting help from professionals is sub-human treatment? The commission exists to help addicts and to lower drug usage, and it has succeeded in doing such.
t1_dtlhym9	1	*	The cheapest method is the Duterte method 
t1_duch8oo	1	*	You obviously haven't eaten much Irish cuisine.

t1_duflgey	1	*	Thanks. I appreciate it. And sorry if you got offended by anything I said. Have a good rest of your day
t1_dujrgox	1	*	We don't annex because of nukes. Putin is ignoring that.
t1_dsvz73y	1	*	Show me polls from the 40 where Jews, not Germans, say that they hate the West and want to kill the Allies, and youll have a point.
t1_dsvyztb	0	*	Because their home countries refuse to take deportees.
t1_ds3518n	1	*	On top of that if they are currently within range they are smart enough to move to another area of the tribal region if they know we have a new limited range. 
t1_dsyrxrl	0	*	You don't understand economics as much as you think. That's why you can't counter.  Why don't you start by learning those terms you didn't understand.
t1_ds9cypy	1	*	Yep, I was looking for a better source than wikipedia. Thanks for responding anyway. I suppose I will just need to do extra leg-work.
t1_ds95mi5	0	*	Yes, sometimes the product is more than the sum of the factors involved.

t1_ds9mkun	1	*	it's best to specify 'integrally divisible'. http://mathworld.wolfram.com/EvenNumber.html
t1_du3a5p5	0	*	China is absolutely a rival of the US.  They support North Korea, and try to assert control over the whole south china sea.  We're not shooting at each other, but we're not friends.
t1_du3cgyc	1	*	I am not sure about that.  Maybe.  How do you figure?  I see can't trust us as India doesn't trust it's govt to negotiate an arrangement
t1_dtiovjw	0	*	What a joke, articles from 2003 and 2010. When you can show me a clip of CNN/msnbc talking about this problem in the last year I'll take you seriously
t1_dset69q	1	*	OK, not wrong. What you said doesn't mean the humanitarian aid they get goes straight to their nuclear program.
t1_dsq8x3z	0	*	Memory?  Who the fuck cares about memory when you can just look up this on the Wikipedia or someplace else on the internet.  This stuff doesn't fade away anymore like it used to.
t1_dss77sv	0	*	Hey, that is great information. Now imagine if your first rebuttal had that in it! The OP would look even more like a fool eh?
t1_dundjet	0	*	No shit, that wasn't the point I was making though  I'm on a phone, feel free to look yourself, count of around 80, in London 
t1_ds4wmnl	0	*	No. Mine is based on two year coverage of migrant crisis. Yours is based on denial of reality.
t1_dstfm37	1	*	I am harassing you, by quoting your rule breaking posts? You should learn the meaning of phrases before you try using them as insults.
t1_dstiuji	0	*	Govern, not colonize it.
t1_dstao3m	0	*	Hamas has had control of the Gaza Strip for quite some time, now. They don't show much sign of turning swords to plowshares, bomb belts to...regular belts.
t1_dutlz4g	0	*	Why was Afghanistan necessary? Not challenging just asking because i'm curious :) 
t1_dutq63q	1	*	Derp

t1_duucymq	0	*	In all seriousness, read this article.  https://thetruthaboutcancer.com/polio-vaccine-cancer/
t1_dutpd1a	0	*	Criticizing the egghead experts in the ivory tower has been around a long, long time, friendo.  It's being exploited by the right wing currently, but they hardly invented it. 
t1_dv4lm6r	0	*	how long until you become embarrassed by your behaviour my friend?
t1_dv52xvp	1	*	You'd probably make a bit more, and have more free time? 
t1_dv4m8gz	1	*	I'm curious how a VPN would interact with those stupid Internet fast lanes. Couldn't you just mask your traffic with a VPN, so it didn't look like you were using YouTube or Twitch or whatever? 
t1_dv538g2	1	*	Fuck off mate, Im on FTTP 100/40mbps and that is not a problem. You dont need gigabit internet for that.
t1_dv4bfbp	1	*	They've monopolized the industry, we're getting by on the dregs. At least you can get cable, won't have fibre here until 2020. as for cable, it's a non-existent connection altogether in my area.
t1_ds5drq1	0	*	Or they can jsue you and you'll end up like State Farm owing a few hundred million http://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/30/business/business-people-the-woman-who-sued-state-farm-and-won.html
t1_ds5dxl0	0	*	That doesn't mean you get to break the law.  If you don't like it I'd suggest voting straight republican they hate equal pay laws.
t1_ds5eq0o	1	*	Fair point
t1_ds5io36	1	*	Your level of aggression makes you seem insecure in your position.  
t1_ds5edsc	0	*	I've said this to others, I'd recommend donating to your local republican if you want to change it because they hate equal pay laws probably as much as you do.
t1_ds5e34p	1	*	I'm not sure how you came by this information.
t1_ds5i5wh	0	*	Correct. 
t1_ds5m9f7	1	*	Thank you. 
t1_ds5q0ag	0	*	I wouldn't really be bothered by the insults of an ex I no longer approved of.  And I'd be safe from letting them back into my life.  Neither of those things seems scary.
t1_ds5ezgo	0	*	You've shown in #4 you men and women the same by promoting one of each, in #3 you've discriminated against the women which could be toruble if there's a pattern of you doing that.
t1_ds6gzci	1	*	wut
t1_dtoa4ic	0	*	Dude, fuck you. 
t1_dtq6ief	0	*	Not lying and defrauding, but taking advantage of loopholes and obscure legal clauses.  That's the norm.  For smart people at least.  
t1_dtoayb4	0	*	> Yeah, its such a terrible awful thing for obama to enact economic policies that would benefit the country even after hes out of office.  I'm interested in these policies.
t1_dtnzx1a	1	*	Indexed funds are the opposite of investing clairvoyance. 
t1_dto11a2	0	*	Sure: populations are made of individuals.
t1_dtovlli	0	*	How is toque pronounced? 
t1_dto63bm	0	*	True, that is the part I struggle with. Although dont you believe a country is supposed to take care of its own citizens?
t1_dto52vj	0	*	 Bitch you're right, I'm drunk. And your original statement was still misleading. 
t1_dto3ia9	1	*	And that was easier than just saying never from the start? 
t1_dtowqfi	0	*	If you didn't change their mind you didn't win the argument imo. Their resentment only adds fuel to the fire that is their ignorant opinion. 
t1_dtr2qgj	0	*	Say it with me: Mister President
t1_dtpcjtx	1	*	What reason would you interject that isn't biased?
t1_dto2prg	0	*	I'm done. Have a good life!
t1_dumkz3o	0	*	More lies, so the FBI is telling lies now
t1_dumblal	0	*	Fuck me ur English is terrible
t1_du04hz1	0	*	Thats interesting. I hadnt seen that before. So maybe they were lead to believe there wouldnt be consequences for invading. That doesnt make it right. 
t1_du1lj8i	1	*	And he surely didn't halve the defense budget in a year. 
t1_durc6bb	0	*	link something, I'll read.
t1_durc9rb	1	*	I'll call bull on that.  The blackjack dealers at the Silver Star have taken many a $20 from me.
t1_durs07u	0	*	Haha, be careful. I got labelled a wheraboo for saying that.
t1_durqe4n	0	*	Being confused on which foreign military awards are equivalent isn't really something that needs to be forgiven.  Just an honest mistake.
t1_dus00em	0	*	Um you were the one falsely interpreting my argument
t1_dure0pm	0	*	Yup, nobody but the US has ever cared about Western values. It seems you simply enjoy picking internet fights. Have a nice day.
t1_duru346	1	*	OK, I see what youre saying. I disagree with your moral system, but I doubt that I will be able to make you change your mind.
t1_durc58l	0	*	I don't believe you.
t1_durj2cy	1	*	No.  I was not taught that in school.
t1_duyz4dj	1	*	please do.
t1_durkegk	0	*	Ok, well you sound like you know a lot more than I do from a brief Google search. Appreciate you taking the time to educate me on it!
t1_duss02j	0	*	They really loaned them over 430 ships?
t1_durij7f	0	*	Backing up does not mean claim another fact without a source. 
t1_durusvv	0	*	You're not going to get over it now are you?
t1_durvcdm	1	*	I'm talking about the decisions to drop Fat Man and Little Boy.
t1_dsfk346	1	*	That will be to the judge, and only him to say. But granted, innocent until proven guilty.
t1_dsudp02	0	*	You should be sorry. You have nothing to talk about except the same two ideas swirling around in your head. Fake platitudes, how nice.   Cut the partisan bullshit. It's a cop out. 
t1_dtbqej8	0	*	Fast and Furious was a drop in the water of what is a common practice though.
t1_dthizl1	0	*	I didn't but, please, lie more, that really makes you look cool.  edit; ew you're a weird stalker chasing me from another discussion on another day.  How embarrassing for you.
t1_dtg2lke	0	*	That's completely untrue. Where are you getting that information? Try conspiracy, money laundering, and multiple counts of obstruction.
t1_dtgzn7n	0	*	Do you support the Women's March organizers like Linda Sarsour and them?
t1_ds5xai4	0	*	Ugh. Forget it, kid, you're the smartest keyboard warrior to ever keyboard warrior and I'm in awe of your intellectual prowess. Happy now? 
t1_durkwfv	0	*	I'm fairly certain all historians would agree she wasn't French African. If Leelee Sobieski is 5'10 I'd say that's bad casting.
t1_dtic8op	0	*	I dunno, 19 bucks is a lot for a taco bowl, can we at least split the check?
t1_du8mu13	1	*	You're right, sorry.
t1_du8fwpb	0	*	Give us universal income and use that extra money to support it and I'd be all for it, haha.  That's a wee bit political though.
t1_du8yjci	0	*	they have a right to have sex. they don't have a right to kill a baby if that sex results in a pregnancy just because they can't afford to keep it.
t1_du8zdg2	0	*	I guess Im missing something, and for that I apologize. One thing I think we can agree on is having someone pay extra for something that technically saves them money, is stupid. 
t1_duana1p	0	*	From an ethical point of view, you are simply wrong.
t1_duaglxp	0	*	Thanks both parts of your comment are extremely interesting! You seem to have lives quite an interesting life. 
t1_dua1wi3	0	*	And let me type it out in simple term for you:  *That system is bullshit and shouldnt be practiced on ethical grounds.*
t1_du8gbmd	0	*	Yeah thats not gonna fix much. People get shot here all the time with openly displayed *empty* hands.
t1_du9awjc	0	*	No, their death will suck knowing that it could have been prevented if that perfect match was an organ donor. And neither life nor death are significant at all after you're dead, you're dead.
t1_du9518b	0	*	We'll just ignore the fact that several people that have strong religious upbringing or other belief systems that include not having their body buried incomplete.
t1_ducarjw	0	*	Society is currently being held back by religious and ignorant people.Take away their influence and right to say, and society will progress rapidly.
t1_dtp8dw3	0	*	Actually they did it quite out in the open...just ask the netherlands, or our own FBI and CIA which acknowledge that the election was tampered with.  
t1_dumkvew	0	*	lol big words what a jackass. you just started using that latin phrase cause you think its cool and makes you look smart. lol
t1_dskzbf9	1	*	And the virtue signaling comes out like a herpes outbreak. Non whites should be let in bybtge same conditions as Europeans these days. That is to say hardly any at all
t1_dsktfj1	0	*	Im going to go eat some *pizza in your honor.
t1_dszgyu5	0	*	So you're telling me a union job is a decent paying job for those with only a diploma? Man, must be nice to have a union getting one wages one can live on. 
t1_dsy3foi	0	*	I make a point of not entertaining strawmen or moving goalposts. 
t1_dszspyd	1	*	Yes i know that, youre still wrong. 
t1_dszrdwt	1	*	Either the both of you can't read or you're just not good with basic logic. The guy I responded to even admitted to being wrong.
t1_dsyqx39	1	*	So are elections.
t1_dsxnyw1	0	*	You just said you were though? 
t1_dtvccob	0	*	Literally not going to read any of that.   1. because I don't care enough to answer you.

t1_dtvo3ph	1	*	it was clear the whole time, this guy just doesnt read before getring in a fuss
t1_dtvt94u	1	*	Maybe you should, then you can make an educated statement after seeing both sides of the argument.
t1_dtvg0le	1	*	Oh ok
t1_dtvqody	0	*	Yeah, we are done here. 
t1_dtvukc9	0	*	Yep. And so?
t1_dtw37ym	0	*	This isn't about humans. This is about non human animals. Humans have no clue how to make animals better. They do a shit job every time. What makes you think it would be different with humans?
t1_dtvqc24	0	*	Energy, but not work. With a plant you have to plant it and water it and harvest it, with an animal you just stick it in a field and itll figure itself out. 
t1_dtvn7fu	0	*	Mind elaborating on how you can eat another animal without mistreating it?
t1_dtvhbmx	0	*	I dont really know what you are talking about, are you talking to yourself while pretending to have a conversation?
t1_dtvqm5g	0	*	I feel like it's easier to remove all taste from beans, that would be okay with me.
t1_dtvfrbk	0	*	Was on Hulu for a while too, not sure if it still is as I havent been on there in a while. I think Hulu had the most recent season too, where Netflix didnt.
t1_dtvjp2c	1	*	it was a tiny little bike.   no, but seriously, apparently the thing flopped around a lot and my friend was scared to stop. 
t1_dtviyb2	0	*	Britain and europe Britain is in europe
t1_dtvtsmg	1	*	Maybe we should give them contraceptives instead of hiring people to kill animals that are old.
t1_dtvnwl9	1	*	yep and yep   the after does not look so photogenic 
t1_dtvptt3	0	*	So I guess you're OK with being eaten as long as you get shot in the back of the head? 
t1_dtzkvj5	0	*	What makes you think this?
t1_dtvyaoa	0	*	Did you even read it, it supports my point.  > None of that, of course, means that increased meat consumptionor any meat consumption at allis necessary for the proto-humans 21st century descendants. 
t1_dtvlue2	1	*	I think she just wanted the bacon.
t1_dtxcft7	0	*	Of course my friend, you caused no offence. Take care of yourself
t1_dtvigv3	1	*	Again, I don't particularly have an issue with it. But it is not any kind of accomplishment. 
t1_dtvw857	0	*	Doesn't that mean the animal will weigh less? You can't starve an animal for more than a day without significant weight loss (i.e lost meat).
t1_dtvhq91	0	*	~~Ya uh looks like we agree.~~  E: What a ninja edit.
t1_dtvfbvm	0	*	Yes, you could. 
t1_dtw8naj	0	*	I think I'll just agree to disagree with you man.
t1_dtvqkvc	0	*	To be fair, my first source was a scholarly article. I only posted the radiolab link because I thought it was interesting, relevant, and well done.
t1_dtw11av	1	*	No worries, I misunderstood your original comment to just include monetary means. Sorry! 
t1_dtvt3ou	0	*	So humans need food, water, shelter, and a car to survive?  
t1_dtvtzj8	1	*	Anyone can comment, but youre the one stating only americans matter concerning eating meat...
t1_dtwg2kv	1	*	If they're well cared for, not killed and not bought from a breeder (who kills the male chickens) - sure. Picking up a few eggs won't do any harm by itself after all.
t1_ds39nr0	0	*	>  family friends   By  family friends  you mean they are native Okinawa people, I presume?  You can make up whatever lies here, but please be honest with yourself.  
t1_duveffy	1	*	I don't see why you are so upset. I have been to those countries. It's why I do what I can where I am and where I go. I hope you have a good day though!
t1_ds3ppw4	0	*	If you are gonna continue down the It's the agriculture industry panicking conspiracy stuff then consider me done with this conversation. 
t1_dtiloep	0	*	1 year of Trump in presidency. Also, this was only passed with a simple majority because it was deficit neutral. Regardless, let's just wait and see where our country's deficit is in 3 years.
t1_dsn09o0	0	*	Survival of the fittest is a thing, it might hurt a lil bit but if you're saying we can't sustain ourselves as a country without illegal aliens breaking the law I don't know what to tell you. 
t1_du70r9x	1	*	Sanctions are also harming aid delivery and humanitarian aid will not be enough for the North Korean people to survive on. Sanctions are also restricting oil deliveries into the country. 
t1_dsk1mnq	0	*	The quantity of chemical weapons required to harm a naval ship from an exterior attack is not going to be transported via drone. 
t1_dslakni	1	*	Chloramine gas is a laughable chemical weapon. 
t1_dslas3g	1	*	Be about as effective 
t1_duo0lz9	0	*	The party base favoured Hillary from the outset. This is stunningly obvious.
t1_duog7b0	0	*	Just like it happened in the post apocalyptic wasteland called rest of the world, right?
t1_dunxg7l	0	*	Well I guess what I meant was just political rightness rather than conservatism, because I too have fallen into the trap of thinking right is cons, left is libs.
t1_dunl0bz	0	*	This conversation is a pretty good mirror for the state of the western world. Well educated people being ignorant and self centered without even knowing.. It's always the others
t1_duptl7g	1	*	No, it won't be fixed under Trump. And, it won't be fixed under the Democrat after him. 
t1_duods8k	0	*	We're far from a post scarcity society, the jobs will run out long before that and that'll increase scarcity not reduce it.
t1_dunwbua	1	*	I meant for the general public
t1_duo0jal	0	*	And how have things been going, now that the upstart is in power?
t1_dunpa3f	1	*	Glass houses buddy.
t1_dunye3q	1	*	I know you read that saying literally.  I'm asking you why.
t1_duo369m	0	*	>Wealth inequality is a made up problem.  You're incredibly stupid if you can't see the problem with having a prosperous, politically engaged upper class and an oppressed proletariat.
t1_dus1z1q	0	*	The specific example I originally mentioned to you. The Chilean 9/11.
t1_dunoupt	0	*	Without anybody to hire or traffic they wouldn't be able to do so in the first place, there's plenty of blame to go around.
t1_dunpa7c	1	*	Laters dude!
t1_duo1qr8	0	*	And where does the obstructionism come from in American politics regarding immigration reform? 
t1_dupfvbm	0	*	I will explain if you answer my question.
t1_dsgtara	1	*	I have solar, but not a powerwall yet.
t1_dt397wu	0	*	You would call Jesus edgy.  And no I'm not comparing myself to Jesus.  
t1_dt403ll	1	*	Who's talking about a right to displace them?   No one is displacing those in East Jerusalem, they have a right to be Israeli citizens.
t1_dt38uy3	1	*	As an atheist I see them not giving a shit about stabilizing the Middle East.
t1_dttbp9z	0	*	My wife has no medical treatment and she makes those decisions every day for our kids and herself when I'm gone at work. I think most people are capable of making that choice 
t1_dttbqn2	0	*	My federal taxes were 5.4% of my income last year. Local taxes (that pay for my department's budget) were much lower. That's the trade off. Nothing is free. 
t1_dttbu3g	0	*	I paid 5.4% in federal taxes last year. That would not be possible with free health care 
t1_du0q8f9	1	*	Yes.
t1_dttdy7x	0	*	The op left with bankrupting debt and you say it's far from ideal? 
t1_dtujc79	1	*	Best to sail around the Great Barrier Reef while it's still there

t1_dtur8ub	1	*	Its from a girl on Dr Phils show
t1_dttbj61	0	*	I paid 5.4% in federal taxes though 
t1_dttn6x0	0	*	Ah, cant argue against facts so just dismiss.  See, when you say zero, anything more than zero means you are wrong.   Its kindergarten math
t1_dtujxeg	0	*	No but you can't fault the doctor for doing what they viewed as necessary. It also sounds like you didn't even ask the doctor what else could be done you just took what they said and left.
t1_dttgrf0	1	*	The same to you. I hope you'll suffer a bt less from this randomly getting angry at people because you don't comprehend what they're saying. 
t1_dtwlrgb	1	*	But I've never said that Cuba was a great success. But communism worked there. It has a lot of flaws just like capitalism.
t1_dtukjda	0	*	Lol that people think Obama was left or a good president 
t1_dttd01l	0	*	God damn you can't manage a paragraph without throwing out insults like a child having a tantrum.

t1_dtu51ub	0	*	Rape at gunpoint is voluntary in that you can always choose to be killed instead   See how absurd your backwards statist logic is?
t1_dttf4hg	0	*	It's still quite sick. I want you guys to be paid really well so you can be less stressed and provide a better service. I'll happily pay more tax just for the NHS.
t1_dtxxf78	1	*	Even better!
t1_dtto2xe	0	*	Will do. 
t1_dttdjeb	0	*	I would like to, that costs money though.
t1_dttlco0	0	*	Holy shit. I don't think that even 1-2% of boys are circumcised here in Finland.
t1_dtu1pla	0	*	Eating a pepperoni pizza is voluntary because you can always choose sausage instead
t1_dttftqw	0	*	You have to do it every morning in case you got drunk and accidentally slept around with some other flags the night before.

t1_dttn886	0	*	Taxes is what he's talking about I assume
t1_dttwrvq	1	*	Call bullshit I really don't care. You don't have to believe it for it be be what it is. Have a good day stranger.
t1_dttdqxv	1	*	It was an exaggeration for me to be able say I wouldn't benefit from healthcare
t1_dttn70k	1	*	You pay taxes that fund public schooling.
t1_dtthugb	0	*	Good for you, if you're happy with oyour life. Without knowing your income amount and the cost of living wherever you are there's not enough info for me to form any more of an opinion 
t1_dttwuh8	0	*	I guess we just disagree. People who cant pay should be helped but people who refuse to pay can kick rocks imo.   Again, no it wouldnt be better for me.
t1_dtwgza8	1	*	A little too ironic
t1_dttjbsg	0	*	I think doctors are like that everywhere tbh
t1_dttd5d8	0	*	I never promoted insurance.

t1_dtu320v	1	*	Drowning by having your head pushed under water is voluntary in that you can always choose not to breathe.
t1_dtu2xzs	0	*	So they're not *really* holding a gun to your head because they'll hold off on being violent for a few years first.   
t1_dttd58l	1	*	Hospitals need money to run, you do know they have to pay their staff and buy equipment right? You're acting like they are charging people money just to be jerks.
t1_dtth5is	1	*	All got to stick together!
t1_duqp6bw	0	*	that's the problem.  The person on quora explained how Usain Bolt's feats could not have happened under normal circumstances.  The boy was doping.  Pure and simple.
t1_duosk5e	0	*	Nope.
t1_durin8z	1	*	You are welcome sweetie. 
t1_duos9nm	0	*	I don't see how you can continue to comment smugly on a topic you clearly don't have even a cursory knowledge of. It's Dunning-Krueger in action.
t1_duqk2g1	1	*	I'm not calling you wrong it's the mind set of both the left and the right. Each side tends to see the other as evil which, in my opinion, is the same reason you are on this sub giving your thoughts. 
t1_du394az	0	*	Im just curious if the people have even applied for these jobs
t1_dterpt6	1	*	Ohhhh...you're a troll. Good one. 
t1_dtdwpl1	0	*	What, this actually hurts my brain. How is investing not ethical? Maybe investing in certain things can be unethical, but investing itself? I'm gonna need you to explain that one, brother.
t1_dtdvddw	0	*	Based on the subsidies, what income level would you consider blue collar??  The ACA heavily benefited lower and middle class people to the detriment of upper middle class self employed people...
t1_dtdvwmw	1	*	No, investing doesn't create value directly, the company does that with the investment, ideally of course. I don't see how investing is inherently corrupt
t1_dtkl491	1	*	... I am just informing you of what you don't know and why you believe what you do. The two parties are night and day. Inform yourself of those things I mentioned.
t1_dtdyjnf	0	*	I mean, mathematically, not voting for Hillary is voting for Trump. It's how First Past the Post works. You either vote for one of them or vote for the other, even if you vote third party.
t1_dtdv84o	0	*	Helped stagnate wages even more while increasing our premiums and lowering our coverage...the ACA was awful for blue collar workers that already had insurance.

t1_dteayux	1	*	I wouldn't call Notch selling Minecraft for mega dollars being corrupt.
t1_dsuakfj	0	*	So you would say both should be treated the same? Like if you shot someone and they died it would have to be some sort of murder? 
t1_duockau	0	*	> If my father writes me out of the will tomorrow, it would not make me mad.  So you do come from a wealthy background, then.

t1_dsc6781	1	*	Bosnia, Kosovo, Libya those are the 3 biggest. None of which were is led. Fucking moron. 
t1_dsakesp	0	*	LMFAO at your continous idiocy
t1_ds9gk3l	0	*	So if you have a spat with your neighbor and he slaughters his wife and kids just to show you he doesn't give a shit, then that's your fault, riiiggght
t1_dsaape0	1	*	Oh, agreed, they're a bunch of dickheads.
t1_dshz0s5	0	*	Doing nothing in Syria is a better policy than supporting the rebels. He wanted to work with Russia to fight ISIS too 
t1_dsa2onw	1	*	Every negative has a positive. Seek balance.
t1_ds9vb68	0	*	I was speaking historically as to right of conquest.  Wasnt that long ago, but fell out of favor after WWII.  I have tried not to inject opinion in to my statements.  
t1_duid30d	0	*	Hehehe, I almost forgot what it was like to talk to people like you about this. The mental gymnastics in order to arrive at a preconceived opinion about a person's character can be fun to watch.
t1_dujom1n	1	*	Unless you are equating USA to Britain's parent, your analogy is meaningless.
t1_dujfcqq	0	*	Bollocks.
t1_dupugoe	1	*	They are possible, but also every black person has the freedom to just become one any time they want. They wouldn't be welcome in Israel though. Whites only and such.. 
t1_duq2r6a	1	*	I guess my ultimate point is that we need to stop the ethnic cleansing, because history shows it results in more violence in the future.
t1_dtbnm4x	0	*	> Speak English next time mate.  I present Exhibit B.
t1_dtbq52r	0	*	You're not going to listen anyway, but you really need a break from the internet for a while.  Best of luck, mate.

t1_dse7imx	0	*	Economy is looking great, so looks like you're wrong.
t1_dumvelp	1	*	I said tend, and even conceded I'm not making that point as a fact. It's a fair assumption that can easily be made that not many, if any, folks at this particular club are going to have guns.
t1_dt6rg6c	0	*	How's this then: few, if any leftists in the U.S. would call themselves liberals.  They're not the same.  
t1_dt717pe	0	*	The CEO is completly able to live off the buisness they can have other people run it and still extract profit from the workers. They are bourgeiose. 
t1_dt7c8rt	0	*	Can you give me an example of what you are referring to? 
t1_dt6quty	0	*	Hmm. I wonder how much that would stop them from throwing the woman if they still believe they will go to heaven anyway. Besides, death by fire is far more painful than death by hanging.
t1_dt6qhou	1	*	I heard that in the voice of Howdy Doody
t1_dt6r0hj	0	*	If they apply Sharia law.
t1_dt6rj5d	0	*	You are oh so eager to call me or imply I'm racist, aren't you?   What are you claiming is not factual in what I have said? That seems to be our mutual misunderstanding. 
t1_dt7q8da	1	*	This happens so much. A definition is used improperly then the improper use *becomes* the definition and idiots will defend it.
t1_dt6afon	1	*	You're the one who started this buddy.  I've read enough to not be a fan.  I never even said I hate anyone not sure where that's coming from.

t1_dv0tljk	0	*	Increasing terrorism does not prove that killing terrorists is the issue and not killing terrorists is the solution.  It just shows that extremism is a growing problem.

t1_duxy49b	1	*	What gwb stole millions? So iraq was just a money laundering operation. 
t1_duxpzt8	1	*	He still uses punk with the Guantanamo School of Medicine to this very day, tool. 
t1_duxyyw7	1	*	> Biafra didn't fight for civil rights because of punk, he used punk as a tool.  Reminds me of a Russian punk band I've heard of recently. What was their name again...
t1_dv087tl	1	*	If there isn't a definitive definition. It's not a useful term. Peroid. 
t1_duy18q8	1	*	Yes where under federal law is that a crime 
t1_duytgdf	1	*	Yeah I already know I'll get my money's worth because Pontius and Knoxville, but I'd like for the movie to make a lot of money as well so they can continue to make films together.

t1_duzsipz	1	*	Sorry, fixed it.  I'll admit if I'm wrong.
t1_duuvz60	0	*	Sounds very similar to 969. They have mixed patriotism with religion and culture. 
t1_dtlkn8d	1	*	You're free to think of your own. Just don't cajole people with your agenda.

t1_dsn3atp	1	*	yes it is, south Korea has an economy 40 times the size of the Norths, the us does not need to defend them.

t1_duuuh2p	0	*	Be what, a bot? Yeeeeah one look at my post history will show you im a lazy troll at most.
t1_duv59v3	1	*	Yup. That's what most of this shit boils down to. I mean look at Putin, he's mostly angry that a lot of his assets are frozen. (for good reason of course, he's a murderer) 
t1_duv9v2h	0	*	Did you know our president is elected by the electors and not the people as a whole. The electors also are generally affiliated with their party.
t1_duuqhj0	1	*	Why would Russia kill a Serbian politician? Russia has been historically very close to Serbia, and certainly wouldn't be opposed to a stronger Serbia in the Balkans
t1_duurfge	1	*	Modern whaling *is* insignificant. In the past, whales have been over-hunted, but that does not occur today.
t1_duusxew	0	*	I agree. Let's stop all of those. While we're at it, let's stop murdering each other, stop being racist, and treat each other with love and understanding. 
t1_duvlrbf	0	*	Is the group that did that still in power in the US? Because it is in China.

t1_duuloh7	0	*	I refuse to entertain Nazis.
t1_duukpoz	0	*	Ok then beat him with facts. If you believe in what youre saying, you shouldnt have to insult someone (first) to get your point across. That only shows weakness.
t1_duumt6g	0	*	Lol I am proud of the fact they kicked your silly asses. 
t1_dt265q5	0	*	Your killing me, but this will be my one good deed for the day. My point? U0001f610 There is no point in a discussion where only one person uses facts to support his assertions. 
t1_dt77xml	1	*	OK bigot.
t1_dt7k9mr	0	*	> If you have quoatas then you'll run into situations where you have to pass on more qualified men to meet quoatas.  You don't know that to be true at all, that's pure assumption.

t1_dsi5qpb	0	*	Noone has a right to tangible things besides ownership, and what they make/do
t1_dsgxlwl	1	*	A job that doesn't contribute to society as much as you take from it isn't a job. It's fine early in life and late but not in the middle
t1_dshe22j	0	*	Truth hurts, huh?
t1_dsgxa5v	0	*	Not that much, because they can be replaced. The irreplaceable people make money. 
t1_dsjz0qg	1	*	You might not agree with me but your facts back me up. Again thank you.

t1_dsh2ujt	1	*	Part time for unskilled labor sure. But that was their doing mostly, we should limit low skill immigration of you want unskilled labor wages to rise. Encourage high skill immigration 
t1_dsiwbha	1	*	>I didn't say providing a job is exploitation. You said that  No I didn't. You did.   Also, it isn't rocket science. As the person is paid more, more people are laid off and their hours are cut.

t1_dsmnyui	1	*	Yeah he gave himself away with the t/d thing and suspicious reluctance to respond. Not surprised at all. I peeked at some of his other comments. He's a racist. Surprise.

t1_dsmfuhf	0	*	They really called it out alright. Math and numbers are a dirty, racist, evil tool of the patriarchy and republicans to convince people their emotions aren't real.
t1_dsmnf1e	1	*	Yeah, where you have lived is relevant to who you are as a person.

t1_dueyfnc	1	*	You know, I may be using a more traditional definition of capitalism. How are you defining the term, in the modern academic sense?  Also, rude. 
t1_due000u	0	*	It was a joke. Enhance your calm. 
t1_due5klb	0	*	>The term comes from the allegiances at WW2 time.  Did you read what you linked?

t1_dudso9a	0	*	Fair point. You seemed to have been downvoted on assumptions rather than people seeing you were making a point on definitions. Thanks for reply. :) 
t1_dueay8m	0	*	I think the term has morphed because I literally only hear as a way to describe shit holes. I know it started because of WW2 allegiances, but that's not really what the term means anymore 
t1_dudzcq2	0	*	I'm just saying, arbitrarily choosing two options is not thinking outside the hive mind. It's caving to propagandists.

t1_dum2s5n	0	*	> a person's racial attitudes directly informs their valuation of the issue of racial inequalities  Thats a shame and a perfect example of the bad faith discourse OP complained about 
t1_dulx3is	0	*	Were you talking about soft power two months ago?  It is a buzzword.  
t1_dus3wxg	0	*	Maybe some day. The bell curve will still be there when it comes to enlightened individuals. I'll have to check out Nassim.
t1_duq0onk	1	*	And no democratic politician tried saying there were good people on both sides of that attack.  The same can't be said about trum0 defending a murderous Nazi at Charleston 
t1_dult4lv	1	*	wow go outside and figure some stuff out ok?
t1_dtaaaan	1	*	You're simply wrong about this.
t1_dtc50pd	0	*	Yeah you must have a lot of practice defying logic since you think your race is superior and yet you're still an idiot loser

t1_dsqsscd	1	*	Ok that's fair. 
t1_dss4w38	1	*	He does not just lie he makes the most obvious and pointless lies. The GOP may have started the oppose the other party no matter what trend but was at least not claiming Obama was born in Kenya.  
t1_dss9scr	0	*	They really weren't. You could make an argument they were on the right, but they weren't conservative.  They were the ones proposing change, conservatives don't really do that very much.

t1_dst5eue	0	*	Well then I fail to see what you're arguing about. You clearly think he's guilty. So you think he's guilty AND he shouldn't be punished?
t1_dsrcu2j	1	*	I feel like I'm taking crazy pills seeing people argue with you. The fucking news publishing personal information is wrong, as you say
t1_ds6o31w	0	*	Once again, what harm (other than to the polio campaign) did he cause? What specific harm did he cause?

t1_dt3rgqu	0	*	ok, whatever you like, I'm sorry the political reality has pushed you to such extremes of anger and hatred. I don't think there's any point in arguing with you. Take care and have a nice life.
t1_dt39rsl	0	*	I didn't say that at all, no idea what you're talking about. I was making the same point, that a national convention is crazy hard.
t1_dt1h3se	1	*	Oh ok, we agree then.
t1_dt2akvq	0	*	hint.. he praises capitalism
t1_dt1e0aw	1	*	Gotcha. That sucks. :(
t1_dt1hmok	0	*	It's cute that you think this is a democracy. With what goes on at a state-level in politics, there is only a facade of democracy. 
t1_dt1chky	0	*	Ok well that is bad. But is that policy or localized corruption? In any case, home ownership isn't really a good thing for most people, imo.

t1_dt21l0o	0	*	That's what I meant
t1_dt2ol76	0	*	I never said I wanted you to. I said I didn't want to argue with you, and I still dont. I've seen your post history. You do this all the time. I'm not gonna argue against your strawman m8. 
t1_dt1eo3d	1	*	Your company is not doing everything it could then.   My company continued to work at risk and the government paid up after they returned to work.
t1_dt1weg5	1	*	Yes China should take in American refugees because it is so horrible and it is paradise in dictatorships.
t1_dt19vi8	0	*	A spelling mistake is something you can overlook but you are literally calling China is Autocracy which is false. Its not called grammar nazi because its not a grammar problem...  
t1_dt1kzde	0	*	**a state in which supreme power is held by the people and their elected representatives, and which has an elected or nominated president rather than a monarch.**  Sounds pretty beholden to me.
t1_dt1ppi5	1	*	Tbh, the DNC likely would have made it difficult for ole Bernie with our workout Hillary. He was an insurgent who wanted to hijack the Democratic Party and drive it far to the left. 
t1_dt1kked	1	*	They are the biggest imperialists today as well in Asia. Also, the PRC absolutely takes credit for past dynasties and uses them as justification for current day imperialism.
t1_dt1lx5a	1	*	It's not a 'lefty euphemism', you sound really dumb. 
t1_dt1k43u	0	*	He was offered a proposal that had bipartisan support and he rejected it.  That's a fact.  Cool youtube though.
t1_dt1xj68	0	*	I haven't explored much of Beijing, how would you compare the two? Which do you like better? 
t1_dt1dwhj	1	*	In work so I can't check until later but I wonder is that representation of her laugh part of the smear. Doesn't seem necessary to show what she said.

t1_dt2f0vf	1	*	I would not read this book tbh
t1_dt1prvi	0	*	True, but that also is completely nonsensical considering Trump won. He has neither integrity, nor honesty, nor quality of character. 
t1_dtx56j1	0	*	You are fully capable of lobbying to do that and just like mike pence wont get a cent in funding.  Having a belief and actually enacting a belief are 2 different things. 
t1_ds6mtuk	0	*	Do you really not understand what population demographics are, and what they mean?
t1_ds6mo4j	1	*	I know for a fact that I didn't call anybody in this thread stupid.  So I'm not sure that having a discussion with you is actually fruitful. Sorry.

t1_duhyes8	0	*	I think it's fascinating that one of the few replies that bugged you enough to prompt a response is the one that called you a child. Whether or not you're literally a child, it says a lot.

t1_dv5fyc5	0	*	You have a really poor understanding of genetics and domestication.  Domestication starts with keeping them on range land; They're docile.

t1_duo02d0	0	*	Hezbollah are defending what is rightfully theirs. That's like saying that Native Americans deserved to be exterminated because they attacked white settlers. 
t1_dtq5don	0	*	Thanks.

t1_dv28b9g	1	*	Unfortunately I couldn't find any numbers, but I imagine the chance of it happening is higher when many people are allowed to carry loaded guns, in comparison to just a hand full of people.
t1_dt3e2vq	1	*	I'm disillusioned with most forms of government at this point, aha. There aren't many world leaders right now especially whose hands are clean. Not pessimistic, just realistic.

t1_dszyhlx	1	*	I don't even think folks who are more or less satisfied with Trudeau would really mind a Liberal minority to an NDP opposition government. Not that it's particularly likely, or anything.

t1_dt4whi3	0	*	Indian food doesn't smell like a skunk that went for a roll in a pile of moldy ragweed, and on top of that you're on your own property, so yes. That's perfectly fine with me.
t1_dt5zz7y	1	*	Speak for yourself, I know lots of people that dont smoke but love the smell. 
t1_dujnd4r	0	*	Are we in a comedy club? By golly, I don't believe we are. Also, I'm just trolling you at this point. What made you respond like 19 days later? lol
t1_dt570rl	1	*	I can only reply to the comments that I see and those that are directed at me, my response was directly to what you said to me. And tone policing? Really?
t1_dt4m06j	0	*	You're just plain wrong. Violation of a lease agreement by smoking recreational weed is just not allowed

t1_duszdwt	0	*	Life isn't fair...once you learn that you will be free

t1_dsa3g91	0	*	Walmart is the only business model that works in the world you have crafted.
t1_ds8qbcb	1	*	There are plenty of other risks to take into consideration. BRIC countries aren't so politically stable. Probably better to invest where you know you won't lose all your money. 
t1_ds93trg	1	*	Nah, you just don't understand basic philosophy while acting high and mighty regarding economics. Lol!
t1_ds9e5g7	0	*	Are you assuming Canadians on 50k don't work as hard? Thats a completely incorrect assumption. 
t1_dtil414	0	*	Maybe you got stabbed in face because youre really abrasive and probably said the the wrong thing to the wrong type of person 
t1_dtivk7u	0	*	Kids are horrible horrible brats is something you would only say if you have never spent time raising children. You're speaking from ignorance
t1_dti2ha3	1	*	I mean, I'm a teacher at a private school. Technology and coding is a pretty major ask of all schools now.  Hard to get them motivated when they're banned from fun.
t1_dtd7d06	0	*	Aint no brakes on the_Mueller train. Choo choo motherfucker.
t1_dtd4n9k	0	*	I'm sorry, have you provided an example? Last time I can think of is crusades. Over the last decade muslims have killed at least a million, if not way more.

t1_dta5ss5	0	*	You don't know what literally means, you assume that AA is injustice in trying to prove that its unjust, and you somehow conflate justice and hate.  You're special.
t1_dtacbn2	1	*	> We're just clever monkeys at the end of the day. Too clever in my own opinion.  Our nature and biology drives us far more than people would like to think.
t1_dt8uu28	0	*	I stand corrected but in my defense most of my points stand that more male babies are born and generally the sex ratio has more males. I did not know the specifics of the United States.
t1_dtb3v60	0	*	The reform I am talking about was for primary and high school children, not colleges, universities.  I am talking about the stats of those in education, not the numbers of those in education.

t1_duiis4e	0	*	Well gas tax I understand because someone's gotta pay for roads. And obviously there are taxes that help us out and keep us safe (military). 
t1_duihy5q	0	*	I was just adding to your point.
t1_duifbte	1	*	Yeah, for 401k you pay income taxes on everything when you pull it out.  Which has nothing to do with capital gains.
t1_duiwqh8	0	*	Thanks for supporting our troops, police, and firefighters.

t1_duicji5	0	*	So poor people don't need police at all? Doesn't sound right, everyone needs police now and then 
t1_duiu49p	0	*	Owning is not taxable. Gaining is taxable. The estate tax is an abomination because it's double taxation. And yes, I'm against high taxes on anyone because it's  robbery.
t1_duilm0s	0	*	There's a difference between investing 5% of your salary in your 401k and putting $18,500 in it plus $11k in Roth IRAs, plus $5k in 529, and $6,900 in HSA, and $24k in taxable brokerage accounts.

t1_duifnas	0	*	It's very very frustrating, as it's said like it's the bedrock of why any other idea is a bad idea. I wish people would stop :(

t1_duid507	1	*	True 
t1_dujyaoc	0	*	I literally just explained my point please read better. To dumb it down taxing rich people more just because they're rich is morally corrupt, abusive, and goes against what America stands for.

t1_dtfbrcr	0	*	Ok just finished reading it. Nowhere in there does it say there is a 97% consensus among the scientific community that climate change can be attributed to human activity. Why don't you read it.

t1_dtgbui7	0	*	Not with that attitude, how about you and I start? 
t1_dshr0jw	0	*	What makes you conclude Yasser was the bad side and Israel was the good side?
t1_dsfns74	0	*	Well its the situation Im comparing and not the food. And Halal is blessed under the Muslim tradition which would be against some Christians wishes. 
t1_dsg7hqk	0	*	Ok fine, but in America a country with a good amount of catholics school don't do this. Its not a hate crime against catholics to not prepare special meals for them.
t1_dtcxz9o	0	*	Yea, not having children is literally the same as killing yourself. Great comparison. 
t1_dtcsxu4	0	*	Does being vegan mean you have to agree with other vegans all the time?
t1_dtcpk9z	0	*	There is nothing esoteric about veganism. We all live on the same planet. It effects everyone. That's like saying wanting clean water is esoteric.

t1_dsltrqj	0	*	A false dichotomy between which two things, exactly? Are you saying that there is perhaps more to life than either taxation being theft, or that any car can be stolen by anybody?
t1_dsmdg5z	1	*	Well, there indeed are other countries in the world than the one run by the democrats and the republicans.
t1_dslxufn	0	*	But Trump's is better than mine because it only targets brown people.

t1_du37n3m	0	*	You dont have a single argument. W/E. 
t1_ds6oe7n	1	*	If that's what you think then fair enough. You just can't think of anything constructive to say. Get with reality, Britain is leaving the EU.

t1_dti5cb2	0	*	You're still avoiding the issue of how staff a government with worthwhile employees without them having any sort of rights they would have in another job.   
t1_du1ft56	1	*	I was asking /u/troppin for his opinion but thanks for sharing yours. 
t1_dur9zo4	1	*	Well I guess you just solved the problem...
t1_dsui2un	1	*	> Can we determine when a life should end? Should we?   Yes. We determined when the animal would live and it would have no life otherwise, so Yes again. 
t1_dsuz4l7	0	*	I just don't think we have the time to wait around for technology to catch up to our insane consumption.
t1_duublgi	0	*	Are you sure? These last few years has seen dropping interest rates, and dropping expectations of profits and dividends but it doesn't seem to slow things down, rather the opposite.
t1_dusklof	0	*	Mmm sweet rolls fuck yeah man
t1_dusjubj	0	*	Go through my previous comments. I'm batting you clowns off by the dozen right now and getting bored of typing the same shit. 
t1_dusmmxt	1	*	I do what now?
t1_dutn538	0	*	How about her charity going under the second she lost any power. I'm not an idiot I can connect the dots.   Love how your ignoring all the other points 
t1_dusu9wi	1	*	> identificate
t1_dusosvl	0	*	Who knows, prehaps they want more identification? Or maybe sending money doesn't require an account.
t1_duso2t3	0	*	Sledgehammered straight through video game barriers.
t1_duskkcd	0	*	Ah. Fair point. I still support more mental health checks and not his decision on this.   His comments did happen after this, but that's inconsistent at the best. 
t1_dusjuyo	1	*	You have a source on that?  Because you're grossly overestimating that cost.  https://cis.org/Report/Cost-Border-Wall-vs-Cost-Illegal-Immigration
t1_dutm747	1	*	Cant even find a Pip Boy in Skyrim.  
t1_dusxuts	1	*	Heh cool, some people get really defensive sometimes so I just wanted to make sure I wasn't annoying you!  No mistakes there though!  Haha, enjoy your Sunday mate!
t1_dusih05	1	*	I think this is a fair compromise. Although I still think we should have some immigration.
t1_dusjkwh	0	*	Ah so you acknowledge the level of dishonesty of your own words. Got it.
t1_dutkk2r	0	*	There we go. Just ignore the part that doesnt support your argument. Nice. 
t1_duslm01	0	*	They don't have to do it.  And you copped out on tighter regulations.

t1_dulnn40	1	*	On second thought, they'd never accept the discipline, for discriminating paralympic athletes.
t1_duld1sb	0	*	Ulol!!!
t1_dv6q3ay	0	*	I mean I'm pretty sure most countries now can't get nukes or make them but Israel having them is just ignored
t1_dv3ddeu	0	*	How is it you know more about South Africa than someone who lived there their entire life?
t1_dv394tb	0	*	I would understand why you would want to change the subject, but your efforts to distract from your prior statements are getting sad.
t1_dv3drhs	1	*	u didnt quote me at all
t1_dskgxm7	0	*	Have fun telling you're buddies at t_d about your excursion.
t1_dv1naks	0	*	You continue to respond.   Seems like you do care. At least enough to try to get the last word, despite the inability to counter my claim in any meaningful way.  
t1_dv18fuj	0	*	Meh, I just prefer to call out bullshit on both sides of the story and then see who can actually provide something of substance. I guess that's too much to ask of you. Cheers.
t1_dv2zmpa	0	*	Rebranded
t1_dv1qgxy	0	*	Yes, how it's filthy Russians dare to know they history better then Western citizens after half of a century of anti-Russian propaganda.
t1_dv1qbrd	0	*	I agree it was tens of millions, I disagree all of them is because of Stalin. He inherit broken system and make at least something workable after cleanings 37-39 years. 
t1_dt9x36n	0	*	The Eiffel Tower comment was facetious, I apologise if that wasn't made clear.
t1_duz3v82	0	*	I'm sick of trying to interface with whatever the simulacrum of reality is that exists in your head.
t1_du3e48n	0	*	They aren't my personal views. A female is someone that has an XX chromosome configuration. That's basic biology.
t1_du966ux	1	*	If you live in an area that something like that frequents you can get coverage, much like flood areas.
t1_du9o1cx	1	*	Thats why I said change the law.  Also, I dont live in Canada and never would. 
t1_du9g67n	0	*	Because someone cleaning your house daily doesnt keep up the appearance that anyone lives there? This is the dumbest fucking idea I have ever heard.
t1_ducvjee	1	*	Never!!!
t1_dtwgytv	0	*	> Neo Nazis  >Nazi  Not the same thing, but I guess you learned something new today.  Also you couldn't really be a NEO Nazi when Nazis were a thing... so that's two errors on your part.
t1_dtucz12	1	*	I agree 100%. It's complicated right down to each and every circumstance. 
t1_du0xwmv	1	*	Well, inform me. Show me some factual sources (factual being the key word here) about addiction to nicotine patches or other similar products. Some statistics, maybe.
t1_dth0etr	0	*	My bad. I just read the quoted Wikipedia entry properly now. I only skimmed through it the first time around. It clearly says ID is not required, you're hilarious.
t1_dua19qw	1	*	Ah I see. Thanks!

t1_dt8l8in	1	*	I sat on my back porch and watched the dog climb a 7 foot privacy fence lmao.      I'm Fucking dying over here over your illiteracy.
t1_dtyzkob	0	*	No, I said that: 1. It's not always illegal to lie.  2. The 1st amendment grants you the freedom of expression, which in this case it's not relevant.  3. I hate the way reddit formats text....
t1_dtzmiev	0	*	You clearly have no idea how seriously Germany takes the protection of its constitution. Google wehrhafte Demokratie if you want to know more about it.
t1_dtzld6i	1	*	Because large states like Texas and California would have more votes than half a dozen states combined, making it redundant to vote if you live in a smaller state
t1_due359m	0	*	Like you said....Its all about the choices we make in life. You've chosen the path of mediocrity in a mediocre job wasting away playing video games.
t1_dtwrmfn	1	*	Man... you say that so well. 
t1_dtwtpfv	0	*	Why do you support wage-slavery?
t1_dtwthzy	1	*	Eh, I guess. I mean, if you really like American Republican-style economics, there's no real alternative in Israel except for him and Netanyahu.
t1_dty6zm8	1	*	I know right? Egypt tried that and they lost the entire Sinai peninsula.
t1_dtyg497	0	*	Oi you fookin British bastard

t1_dtwsjn7	0	*	Again. You are assuming. That isn't proof. We need physical/digital proof that Donald Trump Sr HAD conversations where he HIMSELF was colluding. Open your eyes. We are being played by BOTH SIDES!
t1_dtx2owx	1	*	And your father smelt of elderberries.
t1_dtwz3y8	1	*	Yup, and lack of exposure to me is by far the most significant reason for any type of discrimination, beyond self-interest, malice, nationalism, or any other evil. 
t1_dsq7gci	0	*	But American Jews are Americans. That is their nation.

t1_dshhcy2	0	*	Well, at least you learned the word rule has more than one definition. Little steps are still steps. Well done and you should feel proud for expanding your knowledge.
t1_dsmnrvl	0	*	I said people just like you, not you for a reason...  Learn to read m8.
t1_duuyao3	0	*	No, I'm acting like a person who thinks there should be a balance, not a bias. Show both sides, not just one.
t1_dsezzwb	0	*	Strange that it was your god's words that bothered you so much.
t1_dsed2qb	1	*	Oh absolutely. It say it keeps them to protect us, which granted is somewhat true, but it seems like it really just hides stuff to protect itself. 
t1_dulysph	1	*	Sure dumb everything down in an overhaul so then everyone is ignorant.  It's not rare at all in fact the world is functional because enough of them are getting an Actual education. You're insane.
t1_dt1sn9y	1	*	That would work. Now if only our government could work it out.
t1_dullwzr	0	*	It is relevant, the things contributed then make up what we have now, or are you too dumb to realise that. 
t1_dsf07qr	0	*	FBI in this case being the agency that works for Erdoan. oh you're Kurdish? Oh you're Alevi? Oh you're a leftist opposionist? No gun for you. 
t1_dsf01rm	0	*	That is absolutely true, that's why you need more solidarity though. Not more polarity. 
t1_dsdlamv	1	*	 millions were sneaking into greece through turkey during the refugee crisis? that's new to me. 
t1_dv3n5px	0	*	Almost... but not quite!
t1_dv2d4co	1	*	> Everyone considered themselves Anglo, part of a bigger 'british' symbiosis,   Uh what about the french
t1_duj67ko	0	*	I wonder how the US bases will impact Okinawan-mainland relations (mainlaind being Japan). How long will they tolerate American troops acting like they do?
t1_dujaodo	1	*	Indeed and I don't disagree with your post. Just addressing the part about the 19th/20th century thinking.
t1_dssm6j5	1	*	You and 4look4rd should hook up.   
t1_dsb3f0q	0	*	Which really doesn't have to do with anything being discussed
t1_dsww2qv	1	*	Ah yes the data makes sense with that so you're right. 46 participants were specifically excluded, and with the blanket bank in Gymnastics the total banned participants is 111.
t1_dswbtbf	0	*	Because they represent a country that cheats. That's why.
t1_dsx9f9o	0	*	Inform me then.
t1_dsw5v6v	0	*	Oh right my bad. Thought you meant an actual blanket and didn't know the other meaning.
t1_dswgojb	0	*	The truth is, if you have no advantage taking a PED you'll be drawn to the non-ped league, where you'll try to cheat to get an advantage by taking peds.  
t1_duhbjxn	1	*	Are you used to lying? Is bigotry so ingrained in you that you lie to yourself about it?
t1_duja6ye	1	*	So, you deleted your comments like a coward, eh kid? Why is it bigots are so afraid about what people think about them?   Bigots like you are so mentally frail.
t1_ds7nhno	1	*	I would stand shoulder to shoulder with the overwhelming mass of American voters and I would demand the impeachment and the subsequent indictment of Donald J. Trump. 
t1_dsbu901	0	*	Either you are purposely being nonsensical or you can't help it. Either way I don't care enough to continue. Killfile. 
t1_dujp3fd	1	*	Shit like this is why Trump won in the first place.  Believe it or not, people are allowed to support whatever politicians they want
t1_duk4o02	1	*	https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/basically  I jumped on with supporting him late but voted for him due to his policies. Again, though, cut to the chase.
t1_dsdyap8	1	*	I have no dog in this race; this was a nice post to read. Nicely worded to show the differences between transactions, if you could call them that.
t1_dse3a3o	0	*	So we're comparing capitalism with no-government? It remains pointless to call cronyism a capitalist problem since we all live in the real world.
t1_dseo1gr	0	*	...are you kidding?  No, you read it wrong.  Jesus.
t1_dsjtwxl	1	*	If its unsavable then we're looking at requiring a collapse before working toward a new republic.

t1_dsehwux	0	*	I never did.
t1_dsdwjco	0	*	Wait was that the actual year in the movie? And the year trump was born?
t1_dseaiz2	0	*	Because she was clear that she would take donations since they are needed to stay competitive but also wanted to change the system and was an outspoken critic of citizens united from the start?
t1_dsdv8wx	0	*	Don't be a dick man
t1_dsj8iob	0	*	The am in 'Obama' and the am in Swamp are pronounced the exact same way.  This whole conversation is stupid.

t1_dsfkp18	0	*	Fine, I'll concede the milk. I felt I needed 3 though and got lazy. I just want the shit ones cut
t1_dse4a5b	0	*	No, it isn't. Most measures have the U.S. ahead of Europe as a whole, and the U.S. is growing faster  Your comment is wildly wrong 
t1_dsds78t	0	*	Ahh. Can't defend the point so lets move the goalposts. Well, I move them right back to Palestine where they started. You may resume the discussion now.
t1_due53b5	1	*	You can take 2, 50 MICROGRAM doses of fentanyl and it kill you. Its not about the delivery, its about comparative strength.

t1_dt2h4v8	0	*	Nice meme
t1_dt3vfvk	1	*	The ghost cities are filled up at this point to be fair
t1_dt2vpzd	0	*	More economic freedoms, not political ones. That's a whole different can of worms. 
t1_dt3soes	1	*	I thought the point was the govt killing people. But I guess your point was more like everything China does is wrong, especially if my country does it all the time too.
t1_dt3kkgp	0	*	Take your fingers off the keyboard.  Use those five fingers of yours to slap yourself across the face.  
t1_dt43f7i	0	*	I dunno, dude, you're the one invading and enslaving

t1_dtdq03l	1	*	Also According to some isn't a source it's just bullshit. Back it up or don't say it lol.
t1_dtddbnx	0	*	I love how if it is a Western source it must be biased.  Never mind the state run media in Russia, no it's the BBC who really has something to gain by lying about this stuff.

t1_dtdgd84	0	*	OFC not, i'm just listing possible explanations for the demented idiocy you pointed out.

t1_dsbguoi	0	*	the government obviously. 
t1_duglezh	0	*	It's a combination of tat and a bunch of pissed off tennagers who don't like oposing views. 'Bout 50/50. 
t1_dufnym5	0	*	Worshipping a political leader like a cult god is the most anti democratic shit ever. Its extremely Putin like.. and disgusting. It isnt at all a conservative sub. 
t1_duhnm1b	1	*	Nah pretty sure I didn't. Call me when you see a conservative trying to bridge the gap and not just doing something because librul tears.
t1_dufctze	1	*	Keep that head in the sand 
t1_dufhxgu	1	*	You really believe it, don't you? You've drank the kool aid and you really don't have a clue that you've settled down into an information/cultural bubble.
t1_dufaz6k	0	*	And if you honestly think 13 trolls is a fair characterization of events that got us to this point, I think we're probably in more trouble than most people imagine.
t1_duiaj6v	0	*	No dude, the divide comes from you not knowing what facts are. Pull your head out of your ass, you were conned. You caused the divide by leaving reality.
t1_dug4vfj	0	*	> How many times was BLM posted in /r/politics?   So few I didn't know they had a site to post.  Is it even white listed there?
t1_dug4q4z	0	*	How much more often do you play the victim by pretending to have been called a Nazi than you actually get called one?  Like how many orders of magnitude are we talking?
t1_dstoysz	0	*	Yep. That's why I plan to binge it after season 1.    Orville has had a great first season though.
t1_dsvo1sk	1	*	> flags. Sure aestethically the united korea one is pretty awful   I disagree, I think the united korea flag is perfect.
t1_dsty5ba	0	*	You mean the same Klingons that were basically boisterous human beings in the original series? 
t1_dstpw8a	0	*	Is there a plausible Alcubierre drive mechanism which uses less than infinite energy and/or doesn't require likely-nonexistent negative energy?
t1_dsueysc	1	*	This is exceptionally condescending and riding on the assumption the comment wasn't a joke about using your native currency in the first place. Don't be a cunt
t1_dstxitw	0	*	Box like slightly offset rows on a blue background 
t1_dstq9sd	0	*	Japan's flag is simple and appealing though, it isn't a literal landmass...  My point is that this Korean flag is lazily done and not at all appealing.
t1_dsu2157	1	*	I've heard good things about it. I'll have to add it to my ever-growing list of TV Shows I'd like to watch but probably never will because I'm too busy playing video games.
t1_dstxt9n	0	*	But judging by your post history, it's likely most of those experiences are made up. Quit being a dick. 
t1_dstyp32	0	*	Pretty much the same scenario, actually a hit. Do you really believe Korea sends out there normal staff for international collaboration on the navy quarters?  
t1_dstw9v7	0	*	What other characters do you put at the same level as Garak?
t1_dsuc486	0	*	No, you answered to a guy who talked about Bitcoin scaling.

t1_dstrm9a	0	*	Even papa johns?
t1_dstx8v5	0	*	lol I love the idea of Star Trek, but its hard to get into it in the first seasons (tried TNG multiple times). Perhaps this is a good time to try again! Thanks for the explanation.
t1_dstq84g	1	*	This might be the strongest one yet though. Makes me very excited to see what they can do in a second season after they've had some time to find their feet in writing and acting the characters.
t1_dstrihp	1	*	I've been to a few places where I could not stand to finish even one, but you are right, those are rare.
t1_dsxvt05	1	*	Military fits under the known criminals bracket I reckon. 
t1_dsufq42	1	*	Shit my bad, yea i was talking about dukat, totally forgot that was his name.
t1_dstowly	0	*	I want characters to die this go around. Budget Alan Tudyk in engineering, Suru needs to die or else I'll get bored with him sensing death every time something's about to happen.

t1_dsvhcd6	1	*	dude..
t1_dsvvbol	1	*	I'll put it on the list! 
t1_dsu447n	1	*	But stripes and circles are simple designs, this isn't. If you saw this on top of a building or on a far away ship you wouldn't know what it is.
t1_dsufrf0	0	*	I was thinking of Dukat, i mis-remembered.
t1_dsvb317	0	*	Cooperation would be represented with two distinct entities. This flag has one entity.  Therefore it represents unity.   Nowhere on the flag itself is cooperation presented in any form.  
t1_dsu570e	1	*	well, it's not so simple.  nk is so poor that unification would bankrupt sk.  
t1_dt6ipd9	0	*	Except what I know is a fact, you're just saying you don't believe me with no justification.

t1_dth2rzi	0	*	I'm not worried about being arrested by any foreign government, I'm worried about the security of my data. Why would I be concerned about being arrested?
t1_dsni90c	0	*	 a <.01% chance of being murdered? sounds pretty safe to me
t1_dtur3k5	0	*	This isn't that though. It's ensuring that everyone has the right to free expression and that fascist, sexist cults don't enforce cruel bullshit on innocent people.
t1_dux38pa	1	*	There doesn't really need to be steps beyond that. Just good execution of policy. 
t1_duzli85	1	*	I would disagree as most of these people have not sought to actually point out the bias in their own evidence. 
t1_duyaj42	0	*	Well ... in Colorado the number of Marijuana users did not increase after legalization.   You argument that legalization will see more users has no proof.
t1_du4sd0f	0	*	Yes it is.
t1_du4ssc6	1	*	I personally never felt like it was a big deal, if they could keep the summer time longer i wouldn't mind changing it, but i really like that on summer the day is longer.
t1_dtlzd39	0	*	Okay, so what are some falsehoods you think I perpetuate? I base my opinions on data. What data do you have access to that I don't that contradicts one of my opinions? 
t1_duasjpl	1	*	Russia mostly just has oil, gas, and some software companies. Its economy isn't so great and sanctions have hit it hard in the last few years.
t1_du9wqws	0	*	Yeah, this is for sure the fault of the government dropping the ball. Unfortunately they're stuck in a bad place now, hopefully the rains do them a solid this year. 
t1_duaf46n	1	*	There is no Hardee's in the Southwest. Do you even America bro?

t1_du9ohol	0	*	I live in land of 10,000 lakes and snow. So water is just a constant... 
t1_du9tvzr	1	*	Naah, Taco Cabana sold out *years* ago. You want the *good* stuff, you go to Las Palapas.
t1_du9hgad	1	*	As an African I've met many northerners who consistently reminded me about their Arabic heritage rather than African one. Am just speaking from experience
t1_duab7i4	1	*	The drought is a national disaster, not a local one.
t1_duap5vo	1	*	Gevoelig op niet, voor mij zijn het gewoon mensen met een grappig taaltje.  Ik zal zeker nu en dan rugby zien. Stiekem voor die Springbokken duimen dan ;)
t1_duj5o5t	0	*	You know the other great thing about being a free country and especially about free speech?  You can't tell me what to do

t1_du8pf8o	1	*	Very interesting, thank you.
t1_duccnyh	0	*	I didnt say he was innocent I said there is no proof just women who where paid and a lawyer who hates men and Trump. 
t1_du8gd28	0	*	So you refuse to look at it and educate yourself. That's what i thought. No wonder nobody respects conservatives. 
t1_du7ygf0	0	*	Na, I never said they were the same.
t1_dteaqwu	1	*	I understand, I just disagree is all. 
t1_dtcu13z	0	*	You can also choose to ignore. You don't have to comment on everything that you despise, like you said, all things pass in time so it's often easier to just let those things be.
t1_dtcvwcm	1	*	Hah I only use this account
t1_dtcj0yy	1	*	Well at least we both have a sense of humour ;)

t1_ds7y2fu	0	*	Virtually is the new literally. 
t1_ds7wree	0	*	Yes, making useless ambiguous claims is as easy as it is worthless. If you really think NK and SK have been equivalent in their negotiations you're too stupid to waste time on.
t1_ds7wqz4	0	*	You say that but we are both convinced it's Canada's evil spirit. 
t1_ds8qh1o	0	*	Umm, judging someone based on the ideals that they stand by is *completely* different from judging someone based on their race.
t1_ds8997f	0	*	No you're a troll because you're deliberately using wrong facts to act like your cult leader didn't inherent a growing economy. 
t1_ds8gxqd	0	*	Except for the fact that illegal immigrants are not synonymous with Mexican people and it is racist of those who pretend/believe they are just to get Trump on something, that never happened.
t1_ds8bt7l	1	*	Hahaha, at least you guys have a good humor. I can't say anything about that, you win on this department  (we have load of kebab to though).
t1_ds7v4yk	1	*	Last year... about 780 bucks. I got you. :)
t1_ds8daoh	1	*	Ok, thanks, I'll read this article later today
t1_ds8bl18	1	*	Jesus, you cock.  He makes a point.  US Democracy is pretty filthy and corrupt similar to Russia's Democracy.    Yea, I don't like pandering either, but in this case, he isn't wrong.
t1_ds816vl	0	*	My point is thus proven.
t1_ds8d0oj	1	*	can't be bothered reading word-vomit.  why is trump taking credit when, as you say, the US can't dictate SK policies?
t1_ds870ph	0	*	The UK has been at war almost continuously for the past two centuries lol. Im sure France and Russia arent far behind. Idk why you care so much about bashing the US.

t1_ds8gldu	0	*	Right, because being judged on your actions == being judged by skin tone and language.
t1_ds92fzl	1	*	Fuck I always forget they advertise in Mbps.

t1_ds7wjfy	0	*	And U.S. territories!  And, you know, all those other 16th century people.
t1_ds7xz92	1	*	My bad I had this image of Brit working their asses off (probably because you elected Thatcher..). Still good at being sneaky I see. 
t1_ds7zlmv	1	*	Have you been to Bosnia? I think not else you wouldn't have made this statement xD
t1_ds82hao	1	*	Maybe try peeing indoors.
t1_ds8bafp	0	*	They won't stay unarmed for long if this continues, and I wouldn't say Syria was very weak in comparison to Iran.
t1_ds7xw7f	1	*	If there's anything an Italian like me can do here it's stand back and watch! :'(
t1_dsealb7	1	*	The premise is that lives are improving under him. They're not going to revolt under a guy who is giving them better lives.
t1_dsi9vnk	1	*	I pity people who believe might equals right and feel that force is always the best first option.  
t1_dsg5ag4	0	*	half cocked
t1_dsg9qjg	0	*	You continue to misinterpret my responses to support your own flimsy assertions. Its an exhausting and disingenuous tactic.   Well see what happens with the investigation. 
t1_dsgaf9b	0	*	Bernie lost the popular vote by 4 million. The time to accept that was over a year ago. 
t1_dsfnw5s	0	*	It was in his interview with Luke Harding, he was adamant that Oleg wasn't his guy.   I'm looking for the actual sound bit. My current source is just Wikipedia; so not the best.
t1_dsg4m0h	0	*	ITS TWO DIFFERENT PEOPLE.
t1_dsh5wvb	1	*	That's the nature of his work. You seem to be ignoring that.   He is successful because he finds things that end up being true and important regardless. 
t1_dshemdu	0	*	>get over yourself.
t1_dsg2yoe	0	*	Theres a lot more going on in any election than who is the more qualified candidate. And there was a shitton more stuff than usual influencing this election.

t1_dshcso3	1	*	He also owes several banks $315 million.  http://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-money-does-trump-owe-lenders-banks-loans-debts-2017-6
t1_dsg6xbl	0	*	Okay, that's fair, the bodyguards might be capable of taking instructions. Hard to worry about the rest of the crew studying, though.
t1_dsg3667	0	*	Only Bernie conspiracy theorists believe that.   In the sane parts of the world, Bernie got trounced. 
t1_dshcepu	0	*	Not sure why you are so overly aggressive about the suggestion that Trump's revelations should lead us to question all politicians, but okay buddy.
t1_dsgbo2z	0	*	This is literally a gigantic conspiracy involving possibly hundreds of people. I mean no wonder there's so many leaks. Three can only keep a secret if two of them are dead.
t1_dsg2lr3	0	*	Not saying the Trump investigation isn't unprecedented. Just that this is a bigger version of what already happens in DC.
t1_dsg4jf6	0	*	Its two different people.....
t1_dsh78dq	0	*	I dont understand what the problem with staying is than. The whole argument is people will quit because they make working there unbearable, not because they shut down their office.
t1_dsg6r69	0	*	Tell that to circa-benghazi hillary
t1_dsixt3v	0	*	Israel is a shame is hopefully not what you meant to say, but if you meant that the suffering the Palestinians have experienced in the last 60 years or so is the biggest shame I am inclined to agree.
t1_dshszx4	1	*	You have no argument then?
t1_dshymz2	1	*	I posted two entirely different sources, you can dig for research now

t1_dt0vyb5	0	*	Well, nevertheless. Same impact, no?
t1_dt0vyuu	1	*	Ottoman Empire had a lot more land to lose.   Another example: Russian Empire losing control of Finland, Ukraine, Baltic States, etc
t1_dt0xkwb	0	*	Clearly you have no idea of the scale of Kurdish issue and the internal fights between Kurdish people, I am talking to a brick wall made of ignorance. 
t1_ds6319p	0	*	>And?  And nothing. Why do you think I have something more to add? I was done making my point.
t1_dsleouf	0	*	They are not harmed by words unless they allow themselves to be harmed. Sticks and Stones remember ?

t1_dugqxkn	1	*	Why do you hate chickens?
t1_dueof06	0	*	The colour of freedom.
t1_dtryd69	1	*	Overpopulation is not a Western problem. Indians who shit on the street shouldn't have 10 kids. Ugandans who can't feed themselves shouldn't have 8-10 kids.
t1_dtsjlx2	0	*	Unless you fab'd your own computer and installed your own network infrastructure, just posting this comment shows that society has done some things for you.

t1_du0a8w5	1	*	> most people don't go up and stroke cows usually  That's a good way to get arrested for bestiality. 
t1_dslxcz2	0	*	And there you have it. What an idiot, speaking on things he doesn't know shit about.
t1_dsl1xzt	0	*	You dont know why they immigrated, And I doubt they all moved there to work for American companies. 
t1_dso7srb	0	*	But then it's not free.
t1_dsmenw9	0	*	I don't even know what to say to this drivel. You have provided exactly nothing except some very weird ideas about basic political concepts. 
t1_dslvxm5	1	*	I mean, the percentages that he put after that are clearly misleading, of course, so it's fair to point that out. 
t1_dslsvxi	1	*	Exactly, lol. 
t1_dslseuf	0	*	Are you thick?  Maybe if I type big and bold you will understand.  #*JUST BECAUSE HILLARY'S EMAILS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH TRUMPS PRESIDENCY, DOESN'T MEAN IT DOESN'T NEED TO BE TALKED ABOUT*
t1_dsmbenq	0	*	...you don't really understand words do you?
t1_dslh49r	0	*	Sure, but most jobs in Norway are well paid, thus there is no need for a minimum wage because employers need to have decent wages.    Not sure if I understand you correctly?
t1_dslcjeo	0	*	They share all regulations of the single market excluding only agriculture and fishing. EEA members are basically just EU lite.
t1_dslii0m	1	*	No, this is on you. You brought up minimum wage. He didn't. You need to explain relevance, because as I said functionally speaking no one is paid minimum wage.
t1_duv10cb	0	*	I thought the original comment that sparked this whole debacle was staring that duterte was killing political dissenters though which is why they were asking for that source
t1_duv4kje	0	*	I was unknowingly looking at laws regarding dispensing contraceptives, not all medications. I was indeed wrong. I'm not 16 so I don't mind admitting that.
t1_duv8l4n	0	*	As a 16 year old who hates my generation (only listen to old music like Pink Floyd, ACDC, Metallica, Green Day back when music was great.) I also watch Ted talks. Were not all dumb.

t1_ds5y9qi	0	*	Yes, some owners have lent cars out. Not for that article though.
t1_dslpfdn	0	*	Oh dear. So just to clarify, youre OK with the charter of the democratically elected government calling for the extermination of the Jews? Bold take mate. Very bold. 
t1_dtzfxxk	1	*	Either way the govt sucks dick. :)

t1_dtxrob0	1	*	Yes, correct.

t1_dsd1wq9	0	*	The fact that you think I mentioned a race proves my point that you cannot even remotely comprehend what my points are. Keep chugging the Kool-Aid

t1_duzpata	1	*	Good point.   And you taught me a new word
t1_duzge44	0	*	Early cars were steam powered and some burnt coal I'm sure. It's just people didn't like the inconvenience of firing up the car 20-40 minutes before you could go anywhere. 
t1_duzt7hx	0	*	defeat the bad guys by making them trillionaires
t1_duzesoc	0	*	We need to go back to the steam engine guys!
t1_duzglz9	1	*	Coal burning cars have existed. They're just horrible and problematic to make work. Liquid and gaseous fuels have the edge here.

t1_ds9i81z	0	*	Are you serious? DoD definitely uses the cloud.
t1_ds9umtj	1	*	 I wrong? Are tourists legally allowed to buy firearms? Not every person visiting the u.s. is afforded the same legal protections as a citizen.
t1_dscwjb0	0	*	Lol dude, bin laden wanted to drain our resources, domestically and abroad, and wanted to lessen our freedoms. It worked.

t1_duns3ld	1	*	You're doing fine. I was being a pedantic jerk.
t1_dun5yij	1	*	How am I the nutcase extremist? 
t1_dunqq6z	1	*	I think one problem with your comment is that nothings getting upended. Its instead being chipped away and repurposed bit by bit. At least thats how many view it.
t1_dun5unz	1	*	Clickbait is an entirely separate issue than propaganda. It's fair to dislike both, but there is no equivalence.
t1_dunmx3m	1	*	It's for missed jokes so...
t1_dumzg88	0	*	Lol, so its our fault because your business is failing. Wow, what a time to be alive. Youre right, wage growth was stagnant under Obama. Now highest in years after first year with Trump.
t1_dunqi7b	0	*	Only in the way I feel the sky is blue on a clear day. Easily observable if you just look up on occasion.
t1_dumzkeg	0	*	Also, yeah it takes personal budgeting to stay out of debt and buy stock. I have bought and sold a fuck ton since the meltdown and made quite a bit. Personal responsibility is fun.

t1_dujnm9n	1	*	Kind of like how you're circumcised and super bitter about it and want to justify that bitterness?
t1_dtfordb	1	*	Eh.....not everyone is humble.  Though that kind of agreeable attitude can lead to being pushed around.  Anyway, I see your point.  Thanks for your time.
t1_dtsyin0	0	*	Except for the part where pretty much any other combination of letters would be at least as correct, or even more correct.
t1_dtstomk	0	*	No, your comment is typical blather from someone who's either naively idealist or trying to defend shitty behavior behind a facade of objectivity.
t1_dtstd8d	0	*	This is the only law restricting disparagement of the state and its symbols and institutions
t1_dtssqd0	0	*	Nope. I don't give a fuck. No mercy for evil. I don't even believe in democracy after 2016. Anything that leads to Trump is evil.

t1_dtnm24e	1	*	you're*
t1_dtnb59q	0	*	You don't believe trumps side. I don't believe either side. Republicans and democrats are equally corrupt IMO. 
t1_dtn5i5t	0	*	Those 3 things you mentioned can be applied to both sides and yet you still drum for your team . As always they end up as opinions. And quite frankly everyone is entitled to theirs.
t1_dtn521e	0	*	We talking the same texts here? Peter strzok (sp)
t1_dtn3lfb	0	*	Googled it, no such thing. If you have a source please provide it.
t1_dt93qcu	0	*	He's calling you an idiot because your basic logic steps are 1+1=0. As opposed to taking the step forward, you move backwards.
t1_dt9nkro	0	*	Yeah, and you got your ass handed to you. 
t1_dt6sy5z	0	*	Again you are making very little sense.  But yes, it is quite possible a Russian would learn an obscure Swedish dialect. That is all. 
t1_dscvp9i	1	*	 Thank you. I was too quick to be peachy. It is insane. 
t1_dsag3ci	0	*	Fair point. Political parties certainly can serve a useful need. I guess my point is that blind loyalty to any set of policies seems wrong.
t1_dsafmq0	0	*	Mitt Romney crafted the initial framework of the ACA.

t1_dsahyo7	1	*	Nah, I don't bother debating with unreasonable people who can't see their own biases. 
t1_dsc9uw0	1	*	I typically try to frame our global situation in sociological terms. Anti-intellectualism and anti-globalism come from worsening economic prospects and no real offered alternatives.

t1_dt4qiv3	0	*	k, i can't imagine ever wanting to off a loose-end that you had tell a lie for you.
t1_dt2xscz	0	*	How is that relevant?  What is strange though is you saying that instead of pointing out what parts I am saying is semantical and subjective.  Why do you think that is the case?
t1_dt2xbjv	0	*	Again. How does that disprove my claims? 
t1_dt3vldr	0	*	Herp a derp, Ill just lie and say things arent factual without any trustworthy citation or proof just like my Emperor, Orange Cheeto.
t1_dt3vh8v	0	*	I.... I legitimately can't figure out if you're trolling, or are actually not comprehending the difference between pronunciation and what words are being used/mis-used.

t1_dt332pr	0	*	No you can't it doesnt matter how you try and justify it all youve done is a whole lot of assuming.  Edit: you dont have context either seeing as you weren't in the room.
t1_dt3za90	0	*	If its sourced then the only questions are   1.) Did he say it?  2.) Is it taken out of context?  We've all seen Donald Trump lie about weird things, so it seems reasonable. 
t1_dt347bo	1	*	No problem, I wish it was easier but these days you never know.
t1_dt33gns	0	*	My last comment answers this one so I will stop now. I have actual work to do.
t1_dt3fdl8	0	*	So what youre saying is you cant refute anything listed there as a lie? Use your noodle and dont just regurgitate conservative talking points.
t1_dt36s4f	1	*	Its the same thing. Slight difference is irrelevant.  
t1_dt2xuhd	0	*	I hope it ends with you not responding.

t1_dsxnbi5	0	*	lol you're precious.
t1_dsxuuak	1	*	How am I burying my head in the sand?  Is the memo being discussed that you've got your panties in a twist a document written by Devin Nunes or not?
t1_dsxqkqa	1	*	Your turn.
t1_dshfimw	0	*	> Why would they not go to some other media to get them released?  They did.  This is how we know that Assange is a Russian shill.
t1_dshkgce	0	*	He was explicitly charged with espionage.   Guess which charge the US won't use. 
t1_dsha453	0	*	> That's a common tactic in media circles  But they don't coordinate with political campaigns to do so.
t1_dsip60q	1	*	Exactly what part of what I said was wrong?
t1_ds6cfe1	1	*	No, it shows that Afghans have been deported. But not to Afghanistan.  That's why I said look at the other chart (Zielstaaten).
t1_dsvtwxg	1	*	Not really dude. Causality only goes in one direction 
t1_dukjes8	1	*	You don't even read what I say, do you? None of that is even relevant to my position. 
t1_duik5t3	1	*	You too, sister.

t1_dulac6l	1	*	The thing with his son
t1_dukozq5	0	*	There will only be a lack of charges if the case is closed without charges.  Nobody expects charges to come while Mueller is still in the middle of interviews, except you apparently for some reason. 
t1_dtnkhf6	0	*	There is one born every day huh...you must be that guy!
t1_dtg10qa	0	*	Yes everyone would commit (light) treason for a political campaign  /s

t1_du2eg6z	1	*	You really need to be careful about creating situations that involves calling someone a deviant and accusing them of a crime
t1_du1xvic	0	*	The problem is people were murdered. Regardless of orientation, skin, etc. that many LGBT persons murdered across the US is minuscule. Does that make it better? No. 
t1_du214f5	0	*	It's not my faith, I'm not a Christian.  The Old Testament is a relic of a different religion and those who would call themselves Christian but still take it as law don't do enough reading.
t1_ducy7te	0	*	I see looking through your comment history that this is argumentative tactic of yours is quite the trend!  Some one disagrees with me! They must be a fucking idiot!  Real smart dude.
t1_du1sl0z	0	*	Nixon did the brunt of the work, I'm not arguing about that. But Carter completed the process by opening full diplomatic and trade relations with China.
t1_du23kz0	1	*	Pence looking bad makes the guy who was before him look better in comparison.
t1_du2kb3a	0	*	That's comparing a private residence to a business open to the public.  They're very different things, legally.
t1_du1uc1o	0	*	I know you're trying to be sarcastic and joking but you're correct. Literally every aspect of our physiology, mentality and social behavior is a direct result of mutation.

t1_du1u6x9	0	*	It's Vlad, actually.
t1_du4h7li	1	*	Becuase public perception as a whole shifted.  
t1_du1n4io	0	*	Just because you get a new job doesn't magically erase what you did at the last one.  But you know that - you're just being intentionally thick. That's pretty slimy, but not unexpected.
t1_du2igtu	1	*	I don't think he's aware of much
t1_du20z1j	0	*	Edgy.
t1_du1udh6	0	*	And you base how much help a person needs by the groups he identifies with (being gay, black, liberal, trans, etc)?

t1_dv53ofo	1	*	I'm not making a judgement on your statement, just pointing out that you clearly made a statement that merits a source or justification.  Which you denied making.
t1_duc9gsz	0	*	What's it like to fight against points no one is making? Must be hard to lose. Or win. Or learn. 
t1_duco6d9	0	*	The Japanese side of history that scrubs out atrocities like Nanking? Sounds real reliable
t1_dubhxtv	0	*	He has a preference for the truth, not his fault that Clinton is crooked and that Russia collusion is a pile of lies. Hannity lying (if he actually did) has nothing to do with Assange.
t1_du7iecd	0	*	Because that's how extradition works.  Extradition has requirements placed on it.
t1_dsvt65b	0	*	What evidence? You make it sound like there is a lot of evidence presented in the article. Someone told me this is the case is not evidence.
t1_dswsf8v	0	*	So the absence of evidence is proof of its presence?
t1_dtyb600	0	*	Also, as an aside, it would also add to the lexicon you can get DP'd and not be married, and you can be married and not DP, but let's face it, it's the most fun for everyone when when you do both.
t1_dty875m	0	*	Just like calling civil union (civil marriage) marriage (a term that was originally religious/cultural) is recognizing a distinction between religious and secular peoples. (Discrimination)
t1_dsltjai	0	*	I mean killing natives of taiwan and also neglecting to fight the japanese so you could fight the ccp after the war seem pretty traitorous 
t1_dslcnfk	1	*	When will people realize that saying goodbye looks pathetic and is just a cheap attempt at having the last word 
t1_dt1uvd9	0	*	Birds did adapt and develop wings. Humans don't have any need to adapt to that involves having wings.
t1_dtpxdiv	1	*	> he was excluded from the Greek community.  How was this sanctioned when Ottomans ruled the country for centuries?
t1_dss7yz1	0	*	Low blow, man
t1_dsf20jb	1	*	> US > Stopping WW3  Mate, I'm pretty sure they're doing their best to start it right now XD
t1_dsgvp0a	1	*	Why is that important?  Does that help support your conspiracy idea?
t1_dtbdbvx	0	*	Hahahaha! Like the appeal of an asshat motivates me ;)
t1_dv37g49	0	*	Huh? How is trump a white nationalist racist when his wife is Slavic and his daughter is fucking Jewish. Just because you SAY hes something doesnt mean he actually is that. 
t1_du1y6cq	1	*	might just be a conflict with the hidden comment scores then
t1_dtntf9v	1	*	Probably the best place to be all things considered
t1_dtnlbsn	0	*	And so don't complain about male rape or male issues because its a meme passed around by idiots. 
t1_dt16z0z	1	*	It would be okay if they didn't lose their base randomly by trying to play racial politics.   What did this mean?  
t1_dt6byfp	0	*	So what you're trying to say is, it's more energy efficient to buy a used car than a new one.
t1_dt79sdh	0	*	My original point was a specific dig on how electric cannot be scaled up to meet the requirements of container shipping at large. Fuck your pop psychology bullshit.

t1_dut6738	0	*	I did no such thing. Maybe you're confusing me with somebody else.

t1_duuntvy	1	*	I just posted your Constitution. Which is frequently broken.  Your president just made the decision to stay on indefinitely.  Yeah... Lawless.  Your last great response was bullshit.  Good boy. 
t1_dutnghc	0	*	>Absolutely when all else fails.  So you mean when the military doesn't turn on the president? 
t1_dutczdr	0	*	The DEA, NSA, CIA, FBI... all of whom have imprisoned and even tortured American citizens without just cause thanks to the Patriot Act and War on Drugs.
t1_dutzick	0	*	oh, so we should judge nepotism case by case?  nice to know your standard.  
t1_dut85ek	0	*	I was referring to the socialist medicine in the U.K.
t1_dut7xhb	1	*	The order pretty clearly fails the test of strict scrutiny. 
t1_dutbc5k	1	*	Oh! I see...this is one of those interactions. I'm not going to agree with you, and you won't agree we me.  We'll just argue back and forth.  Bye.
t1_duv3jvl	1	*	Look at my evidence, my side spent so much money obtaining this evidence it must reflect how it is in real life 
t1_dut7uwv	1	*	This thread is really surprising actually didnt expect to get so many replies.
t1_dutchsd	1	*	ASL? 
t1_dut3mih	1	*	Fair enough, though he didn't create that either.  I blame him for rampant corruption and ignoring the AIDs epidemic.

t1_ds434vb	0	*	Well you bet wrong. (who-not that*)  Yeah, not sure how that's a logical response. It only proves my point that we should just kill ourselves early.   Are you? 
t1_dtp4e5m	1	*	It wasn't even me. You talk about things that aren't even real either. Show me one country that has a completly free market to proof your point.

t1_dtc3bw4	0	*	Care to explain that opinion? 
t1_dtc1byk	0	*	Those are all fucking opinions. Every single one. When one has an opinion, they are not insisting anything. They're just having a fucking opinion.
t1_dtcr20f	0	*	He was still lauding the US for their reaction to the Taliban. It's unconscionable to me. 
t1_dtc18vk	0	*	Who said that, though?   Someone trying to sell their childhood home in Afghanistan. Sounds like someone who has always lived there, no?
t1_dtbyruq	0	*	How affected are you by normal things in your life? This normal social media exchange seems to be having a profound emotional effect on you, so maybe you have a point.

t1_dtj0ani	0	*	There's an enormous difference between having something surgically removed and having it clumsily hacked off with a machete, and it has absolutely nothing to do with intent.
t1_dtjgn3t	1	*	I shouldn't be allowed to have children because I WOULDN'T mutilate them and allow them to make their own choices about their body when they are legally adults? Ok then lol. Sad.
t1_dtjlgz5	0	*	It's not wrong to wilfully mutilate the genitals of a child for non-medical reasons?  That's fucking retarded right there. And using the law to justify isn't going to work. Slavery used to be legal.

t1_dv19ov9	0	*	Thats not how that works. You can specifically avoid those genes. You dont here farmers making this argument because it is not a problem.

t1_dv0yj9v	0	*	Click on those descriptions and most of them are accidental discharges with some random confrontations near school property, not what I would call school shootings
t1_dv1a649	0	*	But it isn't. These are still gun deaths of students on school property. You don't get to pick and choose which people's deaths matter.

t1_ds6est3	0	*	Good for you :)  I wish you good luck, maybe someday you'd be able to live in a liberal democracy, and have your politicians accountable to their voters instead of to the Ayatollahs.

t1_dt0ro4t	0	*	Aaaand Godwin, thanks for conversation where you tried to come up with excuses for someone who willingly joined fucking ISIS.
t1_dt0itua	0	*	Generally yes. If human rights actually meant anything no one would get killed. 
t1_dt17p3r	0	*	That's not what it means. It means that they deserved the death penalty. Just because a country has outlawed it doesn't mean it wasn't the deserved punishment. Are you downvoting my comments too?
t1_duh353x	1	*	Come to Canada and see for yourself if you have doubts.
t1_duc37c8	1	*	<3 thanks. I've been here 12 (or 13) years. But I do feel *very* welcome here. Peeps are so fkn nice!
t1_dsl5dm9	0	*	Again. Visit one of these towns. Check out the transportation, quality of life. All of it.
t1_dsl58k5	0	*	dude, im correcting something *you* said lol.
t1_du9zh0s	0	*	Because food is essential for us to live. Dog fighting is not. 
t1_du545n1	0	*	That would cause an unbalanced ecosystem. Also killing innocent animals for that reason would make us no better than them.  Let nature take its course.
t1_du0u061	1	*	You're a lead weight.
t1_dtzq51o	1	*	Grass sends out chemical signals when it is being attacked. Lawn mowers are like a genocide! And grazers like Bambi and cows are MURDERERS!
t1_dtzyvpw	1	*	I guess that's the nicest response to be expected from reddit. Point is irrelevant, though. The US has nothing to do with this story. 
t1_du0b93e	0	*	Bit broad when you say animal abuse, isn't it? I'm fine with pigs being mistreated. We kill them anyway.
t1_du0uwi7	1	*	Ah, well, you know what they say about inflection and such on the internet.
t1_dtzqaji	0	*	http://www.dairymoos.com/what-happens-to-the-male-calves
t1_dtzmx97	0	*	Why do you think it's a given that cruel farming practices are abnormal?
t1_dtztwyq	0	*	alright when you figure out how to get animals to stop killin gother animals you let us know..
t1_du3plyd	1	*	You could believe that but it doesn't fall under the category of beneficial for society which is the moral baseline. That's why you get some moral systems that don't care about animals. 
t1_du1eu0o	0	*	Now what were you saying about foodstamp people not having access to these foods?  Sure they may not be as appetizing as a honeybun, but they're by no means inaccessible.
t1_dtztkfq	0	*	What you believe is ethical is not what I'm trying to debate here... I was just correcting your misconception that calves don't get milk when they're growing. Hope you have a nice day. 
t1_dtzmdwl	0	*	thats a terrible analogy
t1_dtzt1mx	0	*	Where do you typically buy your clothes? 
t1_du08yn3	1	*	Okay bud.
t1_du01prz	0	*	What the fuck are you even on?
t1_du24e6s	1	*	Relax, guy
t1_du0hqnj	1	*	The terms are different. I am not from English speaking country. 
t1_du0adwe	0	*	Oh right you don't care about the animals. Sure.
t1_dtzovfx	1	*	How *dare* you presume that
t1_du07lbf	1	*	Again, who the fuck cares? How is that relevant to what I should do today?
t1_dtzq3bk	0	*	To be fair, these would be *futuristic* eco villages! In space! A girl can dream!
t1_du0hu4u	0	*	And China landed some shit on Mars, too?
t1_dtzyk09	0	*	All the meat I buy comes from bramap Farm. Their website is bramap.com (in portuguese). There are YT videos on how they grow their Animals, etc
t1_du1c4m5	0	*	Because her methods have obviously not been implemented.  I'd show you videos, but it's illegal to record slaughterhouses.  
t1_dtzp823	0	*	Oh I agree with you haha, I thought the person I replied to did too. I just thought that was a stupid argument
t1_du0h4lv	0	*	I think eating animals doesn't make sense in the first world. It's also having negative consequences to many people's lives, the environment, and clearly is enslaving and harming animals. 
t1_dtzmmo1	0	*	Well, the fun thing is I'm sure there are heaps of subs that agree with you, and I'm sure I'd be banned in those for posting my thoughts too.
t1_du02yev	0	*	Do you not think that your actions should be justified? Do you think we ought to all go around doing whatever we want without concern for anyone else?
t1_du00a6a	0	*	>Dont care.  I guess you dont care about making sense and having an actual argument either.
t1_du702v0	0	*	I took a short hiatus from reddit. Would it annoy you if I dragged you back into this?
t1_dtzqh4z	1	*	Unless the protest was calling for violence you really can't say it's connected. 
t1_du04mub	0	*	You're... attacking sentence by sentence and not addressing the argument.  So I'll condense it.  Most people have bigger problems than ethical food sourcing.
t1_dtzomd7	0	*	 >Thankfully we dont need to eat our own species to feed ourselves.   Thankfully we dont need to eat meat to feed ourselves either. :)
t1_du014la	0	*	Is there really a humane way to kill an animal? 
t1_du1c2yj	0	*	Whoosh /  Anywhere with internet for the most part has access to these foods.
t1_du08el0	0	*	With the minimum wage thing, you are doing that when you eat meat, well you are directly supporting it.   
t1_du07h5o	0	*	I do not give a shit about your ethical principals nor do I care how you conduct your life. The whole point of that comment was to show how stretched your line of reasoning is.
t1_dtzzpmh	1	*	Happens a lot in Canada.
t1_dtzwg3f	0	*	It's pretty safe to assume someone tossing around homicidal threats is a bit more emotionally invested than me.   Have fun with your analysis,  Sigmund! 
t1_dtnonmi	0	*	There was no lying. Carter Page was caught speaking with Russian recruiters and visiting Moscow
t1_dt49qgz	0	*	You just replaced words in my comment to make it sound racist. I'm clearly some  ignorant fuck so enlighten me by *explaining* why im racist.
t1_dt4w6i4	0	*	Sorry, too stupid to keep up with you.
t1_dt5dbzm	1	*	I'm not saying everybody has to got to college or that a college degree is superior to a job as a skilled tradesman. I'm saying limiting higher education is dumb.
t1_dtfvueh	0	*	Or are you just an asshole who was raised by assholes? Be slightly less of an asshole and shove a knife through the things head first.
t1_dt0ragu	1	*	> *Religion uses science to figure out how stuff works*  Does a terrible job at it though.
t1_dtne0zl	0	*	Commacho actually listened to his advisors.
t1_dtnqeya	1	*	I guess I'm your monster then.
t1_dtnrnt7	1	*	I tagged this so when the irrefutable proof is released, and the indictments handed down, we can revisit. You can't see it for what it is, plain and simple
t1_dtndodx	0	*	yes, let pick the most expensive example. https://dmv.ny.gov/id-card/bget-non-driver-id-card-ndid (as low as free)
t1_dtngbsi	0	*	There are thousands of local laws that contradict federal law. Obama ignored the rule of law and set a bad precedent. 
t1_dto8l4q	0	*	So you'd prefer Pence over Trump, huh? Also, perhaps calling people who disagree with you morons not the best approach to constructive dialogue. 
t1_dtnfyi4	0	*	I didn't call him names, I didn't attack his character, I just presented my argument. I'm honestly not sure what you want from me.
t1_dtogij1	0	*	So how about the FBI releases the FISA applications?
t1_dtnn4bp	1	*	Middle school/junior high social studies teaches you this. Maybe even earlier. I don't agree with the decision, but you can't just call it illegal because of that.
t1_dtndx60	1	*	It was a veto proof majority. 
t1_dtn8bos	1	*	ah, so a lot of speculation in that little comment there. got it.
t1_dtqtrp2	0	*	Its not the entire FBI, and its not a conspiracy. You are looking at facts, and ignoring them because you dont like them. That is called delusion.
t1_dtnfcvw	0	*	I agree, but people (who are wrong on what really happened) using the argument that Obama just ignored older laws so its ok are hypocrites. 
t1_dtnrpaa	0	*	Several Russians, in a forest glade circa 1850, and the advent of wheels on suitcases, which happened later than people think
t1_dtnk8in	0	*	You can't buy votes if the ballot is secret. They could take the money and vote the other way.
t1_dtrser9	0	*	Canada here, we have problems too but you seem to have 30% of your population in the US are raging assholes, whereas we have more like 10-12%. Almost all of them in Alberta.
t1_dtnxen2	0	*	What about him? You have to go all the back to the founding of the country to try and claim I'm wrong?   Educate thyself https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_Three_of_the_United_States_Constitution 
t1_dtnrlgf	0	*	I appreciate the glimpse into the result of the disinformation network you watch
t1_dtn784a	0	*	On the plus side I now know what a wendigo is. 
t1_dtnio0h	0	*	It's sad to be right sometimes. Eat your veggies son. Hot pockets are not a proper diet for a growing boy.
t1_duypcj9	0	*	NO U?
t1_duzirao	1	*	What rational critique do you think is being made here? All I'm seeing is someone falsely claiming that a domestic American organization is run by a foreign government.
t1_du45pvg	1	*	Queens Regnant
t1_du42vk9	0	*	My bad. Wait, do you only do the number thing when the person has the same title as you? Otherwise the prince George right now would have some number, right?
t1_dv3hrvh	1	*	Being born with advantages/disadvantages is *life*
t1_dtb7r37	1	*	5 fives. don't worry, you're golden
t1_dtb4lnn	1	*	You have an adorable life.
t1_dtax6sm	0	*	Above hella gay
t1_dtbf4s5	0	*	Because the electoral college has never been a thing in our country before right?
t1_dtb6frv	1	*	At least you know where to find them if you decide you want them later.
t1_dtd9l8i	0	*	Can you tell me your idea of an America without weak minded and stubborn Americans. Just some policies you think we Americans are keeping you from achieving
t1_dtb04vh	0	*	I know. Here goes, she did some of the taxes while I was at work and it's acctually something I like doing as I'm so boring that bureaucratic tasks are fun to me and I wanted to do most all of it. 
t1_dtcpnyu	0	*	You're defending the indefensible.
t1_dtazsud	1	*	Oof ouch my creddits
t1_dtbez2v	1	*	They said that about Alabama too. You helped put a lunatic into office.  
t1_dtazdej	1	*	You're trying to be rational... It's probably going right over their head.
t1_dtbc5vr	1	*	I'm gonna be the best Hokage you've ever seen, its gonna be great, so great.   We're gonna build a wall and were gonna make the village hidden in the sand pay for it!

t1_dt5r2na	0	*	Ok hedgehog-who-walks-like-man, when you try to exit something in the future, try to stay away from the small jabs at a person's character as you flee. Sonic would find it sad.
t1_dt8bjxz	0	*	Thanks for the long in-depth reply. 
t1_dta2em9	1	*	Things had the potential to go very wrong and it would have been highly irresponsible to not evacuate, so it's still fair to attribute the direct deaths from the evacuation to the meltdown.
t1_dtpre52	1	*	They just need to add gender studies to k-12 and they'd be in the same league as college... Ezpz
t1_dtbkzjz	0	*	Im getting bored of this conversation.
t1_dte58ma	0	*	Except that's not what he's trying to do now is it?
t1_dup84wn	0	*	its isis, what did you expect?
t1_ds4c6ju	1	*	I told you about this thing called Google, if that's not educating you, I don't know what is.  I could present evidence, but I suspect you're immune anyway
t1_dsz57bz	0	*	You've...never travelled to India have you? Crime is way down but still prevalent and rate-fixing by police is rampant. Safer than a Chicago ghetto perhaps but not most of the US.
t1_dsz9egv	1	*	Uh, you didn't prove anything. 
t1_dszaz3c	1	*	You people use hyperbole for literally fucking everything, but you call others stupid? IRONIC
t1_dtbnqi8	0	*	So a personal attack is what u resort to. Youre hard. Go back to ur safe space and cum on all the other trumpkins. Better yet cum on ur grandfathers grave you fucking fake minority. 
t1_dsz4p8t	0	*	Abundance of cheap terrible food contributes to that too. 
t1_dt1eerm	0	*	Which actions by the government have earned your trust? OR that they would act in your best interest?
t1_dsyze53	0	*	There is a point to this discussion    /s
t1_dszb1wm	0	*	How is it meaningless? Its very telling of our priorities. 
t1_dszjyu3	0	*	So do you have an actual point to make here or are you talking out of your ass? Have you ever been to a US doctor? Its the same thing but you're broke afterwards if you can afford it at all. 
t1_dsz4mck	0	*	I don't think you understand, that was in response to previous poster's remark that the USA is the go-to country when people think of gang violence, when many parts of the world are much worse.
t1_dsz5slo	1	*	lol. 
t1_dsz257f	0	*	Well no that was just a small bonus. Who actually talks like that?? Later weirdo
t1_dszsunt	1	*	healthcare is a business designed to make people as much money as possible.
t1_dsz5xve	1	*	Georgia and I think it would be much less expensive with a single payer healthcare system. 
t1_dszflif	1	*	I once took out a Korean coworker for food in America and he kicked my ass at Tekken
t1_dsz4emy	0	*	Should I give a shit how they interpret it? Our constitution lays this out. Don't like it, get thee to a country that has it.
t1_dt0j68j	0	*	Its extremely fucking retarded when you cant look past such an obvious use of exaggeration. Any person with half a brain knew what I meant. Stop being stubborn.

t1_dtr4g3s	0	*	>Yeah, except Chinese students don't intend to use that education in the States.  Chinese students can't exactly use that education for America if America don't want them :P 
t1_ds47dtj	0	*	It is difficult to negotiate with an oppressor who is continuously stealing what is yours and tell you at the same time : come negotiate.
t1_dtsx49o	0	*	What freedoms are afforded to every other country that isnt afforded here?
t1_dtsnaat	0	*	I don't think these people are capable of changing their minds. We don't need to either to kick out the GOP. We just need to motivate Democrats to vote.
t1_dtwqron	0	*	I couldn't care less that you are Jewish it means nothing to me. I hate liers like you 
t1_dtuarjr	0	*	Right.  So hate speech is 'that which is forbidden to say'.  I guess you don't think for yourself and referring to Wiki is where you're at.  Ok
t1_dsj6hk5	0	*	>He was able to win the presidency so I imagine his is somewhere above average.  Is this literally the only argument you're capable of repeating?
t1_dsi76jy	0	*	Compared to you? Vastly. 
t1_dsi9uvp	1	*	Pete Mitchell was a Naval Aviator.
t1_dsimnap	0	*	Yes because that's what I said right? If you have a hot wife you're qualified to be the president of the U.S.   Are you even trying? Try some coffee, early mornings are tough.
t1_dsj4o8v	1	*	View a Democrat attempting to assassinate multiple Republicans shortly after Trump's election, tard.  Much worse than burning a stuffed animal in the shape of Obama.
t1_dsjajs3	1	*	So you mean 60M people, but that is not a vast group, gotcha.
t1_dsivam0	1	*	That is the occasional user. Literally. That is literally what that is.
t1_dsiicur	1	*	Also dude, Trump made that comment a few hours ago  Shitting on him for days...  Take a break, calm down and get back to me.
t1_dsifaqs	0	*	> protest      Haaahahahaha!  Going insane is not a protest.
t1_dsk5jr6	0	*	You could have stopped at the first sentence without adding the insult... Did you not understand that was an option?
t1_dsj8tgv	0	*	I didn't say the economy was awful under Obama, just that there is evidence it's better under Trump. 
t1_dsi76a4	0	*	We can feel the stupidity coming out of yours.
t1_dt8uxfn	0	*	The point is for you to find one. If I were to name any, the point would be irrelevant, point being MSM hates trump.
t1_dt91ubo	1	*	This Reddit sub gets me all up in my feels too bro. If this comment gets downvoted I might fucking cry.
t1_dt8ypx1	0	*	No, but the fact you would even ask the question confirms how hilariously stupid you are.
t1_dt9227q	0	*	Bush was brought up almost daily until Don showed up.   Maybe you were still in grade school...
t1_dt97463	0	*	Jimi Hendrix never had dreads. Are you thinking of Bob Marley?

t1_dtarmb6	0	*	Everything he manages is under 'the Trump organization ' which is far from a failed company. I used business singular and you used plural. This is your goal post not mine. 
t1_dt92gd4	1	*	I believe you. But the people who responded with violence are responsible for that choice, and the ones who threw shit at horses are fucking cunts.
t1_dt9vbi2	0	*	Right, whatever concocted fantasies make you feel like a big man U0001f602 you're ard mate. Primary school tactics? I'm learning from the best right here then.
t1_dt9h7ru	0	*	Its the hypocrisy that bothers me that a group can be so against safe spaces yet the leader wants one.
t1_dt99a72	0	*	Just because they usually align doesn't mean the popular vote decides the presidency 
t1_dt94iz0	0	*	I don't actually have any money so, I'm out. 
t1_dtbcsy9	0	*	That's actually a strawma n right there.... And tell me. What consequences do those people engage in? Why would you flat out lie like that?
t1_dt8yt6d	0	*	When he mentioned he likes to just kiss women and grab them by the pussy. Surprised you missed that part it was the best part.
t1_dt98zb7	0	*	And what concept is that? That you have the reading comprehension of a toddler?

t1_dt97lpb	0	*	I can't disprove someone's **opinion** what the fuck
t1_dt9a3kw	0	*	Well if you're there you've passed Cincinnatus by a few centuries. Dude was Dictator sometime around 458 BC. The Republic fell to Caesar way before the Western Empire fell
t1_dt8zuxp	1	*	Thanks for the moderately annoyed defense and explanation haha
t1_dt8uvk8	0	*	Top officials 
t1_dt90l74	0	*	So it's casual that the strongest currencies in the world are USD and Euro?
t1_dtjwccr	0	*	Apparently only one of us can talk to women without getting accused of sexual assault, and it aint you.  Congrats on being too incompetent to do what any real man can do.  Have a good night bitch! 
t1_dtwyokl	0	*	But he would also be considered an illegitimate president, given that he wasn't elected due to our democratic process. That's grounds for impeachment. 
t1_dtx3y3z	0	*	Having a MAGA Cap on isnt considered being rude to people? Since you can't even figure that out, you're a lost cause.  Edit. You're also a solid poster of the_cesspool. Yep, lost cause.
t1_dtwy7ij	0	*	Legally speaking, the SCOTUS is the end all be all in ethics/justice. Are you high? 
t1_dtx1kk9	0	*	My favorite propaganda network has convinced me to blame all of my political grievances on those with no political power because we need a scapegoat but don't want to lose any potential votes.
t1_dty22nw	1	*	It's two ballots. They don't have off year elections.
t1_dtx6lq3	0	*	Haha, I love it!   Thanks for explaining.
t1_dtyug2g	0	*	Yeah, but if you can make a statement to match your defense to make what you said correct, so can I.
t1_dtyuedp	0	*	....  Since when do dictionary definitions only apply to physical objects?  
t1_ducyp60	0	*	You don't believe you are arguing semantics? Are you suggesting that Nixon would not have been impeached had he not resigned?
t1_duczob0	1	*	It was definitely a nice conversation though. 
t1_dud2wch	1	*	Yup, so I'd start taking the EC seriously if I were the dems. 
t1_due3v2y	1	*	Okay.
t1_dudqkbg	1	*	Ikr? It's a shame. I truly wanted Sanders but felt burned when I was attacked by fellow liberals for voting for Trump
t1_duetbeg	1	*	?  I never said Obama never lied.
t1_dudr5xf	0	*	Nothing you just wrote made any sense. Rebutting nonsense is not always worth the time of the person hearing or seeing it.
t1_dudhxlu	1	*	Not to mention he's tracing the line of China here as far the road to removing internet freedom is concerned. Terrible plan. 
t1_dud33v5	1	*	So you actually wanted daddy to stay? Fine I'll stay.
t1_dud3f1p	1	*	Hey, to be fair, they HAVE done some solid work. They are definitely no Breitbart! It's just tough to trust them.
t1_ductycd	1	*	It does.   What you are doing is suggesting something that cannot be done without further restrictions on everyone.
t1_ducppxt	1	*	Many local politicians do, but very few of the powerful politicians that are running this country. 
t1_dud0znh	1	*	Thank you!

t1_dt1vvgg	1	*	Yeah hes an interesting philosopher
t1_dt16vln	1	*	There's like half a dozen or more that were connected to Qaddafi. 
t1_dt0klcv	1	*	The original conflict was not, but foreign support has turned it into a religious proxy war. The exact same thing happened in Syria.
t1_dt10byr	0	*	Right, I'm sure we were just about to invade Crimea but the Russians just beat us to it! 
t1_dt1aqk1	0	*	In Germany can you take your child hunting with you? Can that child stand beside you and shoot a gun at the ducks in the sky?
t1_dt17tvj	1	*	I thought Russian bots were informed.
t1_dt2zrv4	1	*	Really?  Because it's been done in every war.
t1_dt0yxiy	1	*	Getting involved with Vietnam was not Frances idea. It was them trying to violently suppress an unruly colony (they demanded this before agreeing to join NATO)
t1_dt0nggn	1	*	Bitch nothing of what I said was meant to refute your point. You didn't have a point. You just gave a statement.
t1_dt0omln	0	*	Please dont edit comments after theyve been replied to.
t1_dt1d00v	1	*	Thanks for the insight and correction. 
t1_dt11faw	0	*	All empires come to an end. It'd be nice if we didn't piss the whole world off before we realize we can't continue to fund everlasting, ever expanding war. 
t1_dt0wct9	0	*	What the fuck are you talking about? The skirmishes of hundreds of armed men of two opposing lords? Hardly a real war in comparison to the crusades, roman legion battles, greeks, or persians.
t1_dt2z9ge	1	*	The first part of his comment about them being stable I took as being directed toward Yemen.
t1_dt0ns2k	0	*	Nothing says benevolence like a rape dungeon. 
t1_dt17uos	1	*	Suppose the Germans don't for what they did to the Jews, or Americans for what they did to the natives, then?
t1_duqf09e	0	*	I think we're going to have to agree to disagree due to lack of expertise on both our behalves, but it was nice having this debate my dude. Good luck!

t1_dusqsjh	0	*	* interstellar * travel to Mars  What?
t1_durbvjm	0	*	Maybe start with getting rid of a huge chunk of guns available in America. 101 guns per 100 citizens is a bit much.
t1_dsfbp95	0	*	I mean I highly doubt it..but even if that were true, that would be one state not the entire united states.
t1_dsxrleo	0	*	> California license to buy ammo.  ...it's California. That's not nationwide. Next, you're gonna compare Chicago's ban to no-voting-allowed-ever.   Come on now. 
t1_dsw1bgy	0	*	Because the US was toi dumb/cool to adapt .280 Brit, .276 Pederson, or the FAL
t1_dswmrwu	0	*	You mean the lawyers that wrote the Constitution or the lawyers that decided Heller? 
t1_dur5gr8	0	*	You are mixing those mercenaries sent to the ME with people defending their homeland. It is different when someone goes to fight for oil and when someone defends their house and town.
t1_dv04v06	1	*	Ahaa but it gets better!  Muhammad had several companions who served as scribes that wrote down the revelations.  If that's not direct from god I don't really know what is...

t1_ds1lbkw	0	*	That has little to do with reality of the game

t1_dszd6r8	0	*	No idea what that's supposed to mean. But even if it were true, I'd rather have a knock and a trial, than being thrown in Guantanamo without trial for something I posted online, as they do in the US.

t1_dsk0yoi	1	*	So racist that some of the people that work for him are *gasp* minorities! They probably got those positions through being qualified too! The bigot!

t1_dtyplow	0	*	It must bother you that atomic time speeds up and slows down based on the strength of gravity. 
t1_dtxz56b	0	*	But it's actually not. It's a *days* offset, subdivided into 86,400ths. It ignores leap seconds which are still time, therefore it is not a true seconds offset.

t1_dueri21	0	*	From what I gather, though, asking how someone's doing and not expecting an actual answer, and phrases like Have a nice day as a matter of course are American cultural quirks.

t1_dtiijy6	1	*	My only request is pyrotechnics in front of the gallows, so he walks on air while red white and blue sparks fly. Makes for better TV. He'd get to be immortal, in a way. I know I'd record it.
t1_dtiald6	1	*	Right, except we're not commonly experiencing an existential threat from said foreign agents, you are the one being willfully ignorant and completely disregarding context.
t1_dti7h2s	0	*	Because there would be no chance of you getting close enough to touch me. I should've assumed I'd need to explain it.
t1_dtidid1	1	*	Oh great reply dude! Much context. Way to be a tool, little buddy
t1_dtk7tw6	0	*	Good god, dude. Its a conversation in English in a Reddit forum, not a court of law.  Can I ask you: do you honestly not understand that hes accusing Trump of betraying the country?
t1_dusqj94	1	*	Those are not Russian military personnel. They are mercs, and not a part of the Russian military.

t1_dud7y79	0	*	Well Flynn sat down and got indicted by the FBI.  He should sit there and plead the 5th or say I don't recall a few dozen times.  Or maybe there was a preferred loser in the form of the lefts base?

t1_dv3ki2o	1	*	Heh, fair mate. Personally, I'm just a young, dumb college kid trying not to worry about things I can't control and enjoying living in the most interesting period in human history. Cheers. 
t1_dv3c0p6	1	*	I thought you did, I guess I got you confused with someone else and this thread is about russian propaganda on reddit. No guilty conscious here idk what I would be guilty for

t1_dv34q95	0	*	Gotcha. Thanks for clarifying. I understood your comment to suggest incredulity regarding a preference for a Trump victory.
t1_dv35q9k	0	*	Maybe you are actually this dumb. It would be 126% more and the months are at the height of the campaign. You're also ignoring that they had 31 TIMES the penetration on the right

t1_dv3hud0	1	*	It's the OP's source from where this whole thread started, not the post I directly replied to.  British.
t1_dv3n9us	0	*	Well, I guess you've given yourself a reason to trample on the lifestyles of people you disagree with. Just be sure to accept the consequences when you eventually trample on someone and you're wrong.
t1_dv3dapd	1	*	You said nobody in t_d was russian.   That's objectively not true.   That's the discussion here. You can deflect all you want, but your initial premise was a lie
t1_dv3b1if	0	*	Sure but say they catch a handful of people for whatever. That doesn't make a dent in the 100 new morons they just recruited.
t1_dv3xas9	0	*	You forgot the most overlooked policy intistution change.  Hillary wouldve not fucking gutted the EPA. No doubt in my mind at all.  
t1_dv3yrqo	0	*	What's your opinion on womankind, in general? 
t1_dv3l5td	0	*	Spot the fact: No it's not lmao. There's no such thing as 'fragile male ego'. Just people who are sensitive.  
t1_dv489gu	0	*	Why do you keep bringing up that Seth Rich was Jewish? I'm sorry but, that is really the most fascinating thing you keep saying and it doesn't really seem to be related at all to the conversation.
t1_dv39bpc	1	*	ikr
t1_dv3gnmp	0	*	Yes it's useless. Anyone who pretended to support Bernie and then didn't vote for Hillary never supported Bernie in the first place. They were just contrarians voting with their gut.

t1_dv50kli	0	*	You are pathetic though, lets not lose sight of that.
t1_dv39rtv	1	*	It matters more that they use The_Donald because there is no dissent allowed on that sub. It's either accept the propaganda and follow the narrative or get permabanned. 
t1_dv4r7ow	1	*	Dude, you're shitty to anyone who doesn't agree with you on identity politics. Cut that shit out.

t1_dthi7n0	1	*	Well, you're in the minority there. It was pretty damn interesting IMO.  And btw, I thinks it's hilarious that you're downvoting me for making comments you don't like. That'll sure show me!
t1_dtu1trg	0	*	That one wasn't as funny as the rest, I think you're losing your edge (or anger maybe)

t1_dsk8pwv	1	*	You realize you're arguing with an uneducated person that understands nothing about healthcare, right? 
t1_dt6bm6n	1	*	There is the disconnect. I'm talking about the TPP which was designed by global corporations to position themselves in a way to manage Communist China's rising star.
t1_dubyq72	0	*	You just happen to be in this thread repeating deceptive corporate talking points. And I happen to be here pointing it out. 
t1_dube6pb	0	*	I am. You can't selectively accept some propaganda while labeling other propaganda as interference. Propaganda is either interference, or it is not.

t1_dtlfe9o	0	*	There is no best part of meat idiot. There is different meat. So much for a 'meateater'. Stop lying.
t1_dtlayj9	1	*	You're still doing it. 
t1_dtjw5yv	0	*	Yup. Irrelevant though, since you jumped on the bandwagon. Telling someone they're spreading propaganda, without pointing to the biased or misleading claim they're making, is just inane.
t1_dth6or5	0	*	COINTELPRO and every god damn NSL that has been completely unnecessary from 2001. Why should  I trust the FBI. I know DFW didn't.

t1_dthdlw6	0	*	Incorrect :)  Sorry, bud.
t1_dtheqbp	1	*	Because your claim was more ridiculous.
t1_dthbejv	0	*	They got the Michael Cohen part wrong. They said that his wife was Russian and her dad was a Russian businessman. That was proven false.

t1_dti0456	0	*	Yeah, you can go back to your hugbox. Take your non-arguements with you. 
t1_dthsyov	0	*	No, YOU have a comprehension problem. Youre not responding to the point he brought forth.  Also, its the GOP and Trump that keep rambling about a bigger budget for the military (drones included). 
t1_dtiie4n	1	*	Not alt accounts, you're just dodging the question because you know the answer. Guy even answered your rhetorical qualifying question and you're still dodging.

t1_dtgivs9	0	*	But until then, this is the system we have and it's the same system that voted for Obama, twice.  They gotta reconnect with the middle states.

t1_dtvzlgi	0	*	I certainly never claimed the justice system didn't have flaws. That has nothing to do with the improper use of the word slavery. 
t1_dtwjnzn	0	*	You spent a couple of years as a teenager doing regular-people work. That does NOT mean you understand the struggle or whatever bullshit.

t1_dtficw6	0	*	Our deity didn't even have to create us in the first place. Your belief that we somehow deserve something from God, that he owes us something, is arrogant and selfish, not to mention ignorant.

t1_dux06l5	0	*	But shouldn't they? Why are they doing the work of social society?
t1_dsougzs	1	*	You already made personal attacks against me.  Your true colors have been shown.  Its too late too try to pretend you are taking the moral high road.
t1_ducfixw	0	*	You dont know what gaslighting is, fine.  Circumcision is a cosmetic procedure. Most US people have it done, not for religious reasons.  There are known medical benefits to circumcision in general.
t1_du9zzdl	1	*	Fuck.
t1_ducgf75	0	*	Oh, alright. Seems to be a tough one indeed, doesn't sound like there could be a loophole anywhere.  But would Jews who just disobey that law be looked down upon by most other Jews?
t1_du9q1al	0	*	Socialist science is no science. Science doesn't start with a socially-dictated conclusion. 
t1_du9c7ao	0	*	I'm pretty sure that there are tons of nerve endings that you're destroying with circumcision

t1_du70898	0	*	> fuels rumours  crazy conspiracy theories yeah
t1_du8cbfg	1	*	The lack of info on the seasoning killed it for me. Bonus for the user name though.

t1_dtgo79x	0	*	They don't have a monopoly on ignorance any more than cows have a monopoly on being turned into hamburgers.  All the same, I think we know what the vast majority of hamburgers are made from. 
t1_dthy8nu	1	*	So just tossing unverifiable opinions around. Got it. 
t1_duvjzlo	1	*	It doesn't matter how good of an individual example you find when the discussion is about generalities. No one is disputing that *some* old people are progressive.
t1_duvl8id	0	*	That is what you claim yes, but that is not what i believe.

t1_dsc5jt4	0	*	You've just called all my people nazis. That kind of disqualified you as a person I like to talk to.
t1_dt1z8vu	1	*	The fact that you see life as a game is probably a good indicator that you're very out of touch with people who are struggling
t1_dt1wn2c	0	*	No doubt, she was always throwing in innuendos and trying to be hippity hop, I doubt she actually had any sort of decent reason to call it out other than her hopping on bandwagons
t1_dt26c0a	0	*	They worked for it so they get ready be rich. Sorry if your dislike this but the alternative is an oligarchical country. Oh wait...
t1_dt2fdnz	1	*	Ok my bad I thought your point was another
t1_dt3ai3y	0	*	I mean I personally do think the rich should be taxed more, but the fact of the matter is, billionaires already pay a **massive** chunk of the US taxes.
t1_dt1vtaa	0	*	I've read several stories over the last 12 months about illegal tobacco and cigarettes, or stolen ones, etc. so I think they have mistimed it.
t1_dt1w3ui	0	*	You move market by buying stocks, not owning it. And the SEC doesn't allow market manipulation

t1_dt29k7b	0	*	She sounds like the kind of person who calls Philippinos 'African Americans'
t1_dt2flbk	0	*	You're right. I meant to say that the cumulative return of a +10 period has never been negative (IIRC), and the SD of a broad index (such as S&P500) is very low for a 30 year period. 
t1_dt1su6w	0	*	Ok, so run me through step by step how you start a canning factory for canning corn with zero capital from an investor.

t1_dt1x8ok	1	*	To answer your questions: Yes, and no - but I can see why someone with different values would say yes and they wouldnt be wrong. 
t1_dt1vwyz	1	*	I dont think this conversation is going to go anywhere so Im going to stop replying. 
t1_dt1um35	0	*	How? If you can barely afford to live because you cant find a job that pays better than minimum wage in a booming economy you dont  deserve to retire. 
t1_dt1tuok	0	*	Not sure what you are even talking about. You seem angry 
t1_dt2by89	0	*	Thats my point. Most didnt inherit it.

t1_duhiu8j	1	*	A beautiful story. Really loving the stories from vets here. Always interesting to see how vets view Iraq vs. How regulars do. You guys have far more insight. 
t1_duhirvj	1	*	Yeah sure, tourism is a big industry. It's not like you're going to be in uniform when you visit, you're just another tourist.

t1_dujwv24	1	*	Well, I hope I have answered all your questions.
t1_dujtuk7	0	*	And your contribution to the status quo is noted. I'm sure your check is in the mail. Why do you feel you need to attack marginalized people? Sad your alt-right sub go deleted?

t1_dujdz6l	0	*	And six investigations have all found it to be a suicide.
t1_duksjt5	1	*	Understandable. I'm trans, and things that a lot of trans people do (myself included) annoy me a lot more than it should, so it happens.
t1_dul6pia	0	*	So you don't see any signs at all of trump becoming increasingly less checked by the judicial and legislative branches?
t1_dulcl31	0	*	It also means that more people think im right. 
t1_duj6625	0	*	Nice try, I'm not drinking any tea for a while now.
t1_duivlyo	0	*	How about the fact that John hopkins has resumed transitioning services, rebuked the man who stopped them and now welcomes trans people? That kinda ruins your narrative though.....

t1_dtu37kw	1	*	The Chinese are doing to these muslims, what the muslims are currently doing to Europeans. If they don't like it then they should just move to Europe.

t1_duc0f0t	0	*	Youre funny.
t1_dsuthqa	0	*	Yes, I should be giving the benefit of the doubt to Apple. Not like they'd do something unethical. 
t1_dsvfopt	1	*	Because the ban wasnt required for them to figure anything out?  They wanted to improve vetting etc. Why do you need to stop immigration whilst you carry that out?
t1_dsuxhna	0	*	Provide undeniable proof he is a racist. It shouldn't be so hard if you are so sure. As far as I'm concerned, Trump is not a racist unless proven otherwise.

t1_dsv4vmc	1	*	I care as much about how nazis vote as I am sure you care about how communists and islamic terrorists vote.
t1_dsvmy5v	0	*	Did you not read the article I linked? Legal immigration increases wages for existing American citizens. It does not decrease the minimum wage.
t1_dsuule9	0	*	Nice.  Easy to ignore the racism when you don't really disagree with it. 
t1_dsw2fjw	0	*	I was responding to someone who responded to you about the actual numbers of nazis (the kind the actually identify as nazis). It wasn't directed at you, and was in agreement with your point.

t1_dsusws1	1	*	I gotcha
t1_dsv8yed	0	*	Go look up the immigration reform act, stop being lazy
t1_dsxcrhl	0	*	A general statement bitching about people making general statements. Youre not fooling anybody you think youre the first right winger to complain about being called a racist? 
t1_dsv9xfk	1	*	Also those bonuses were nothing.  $1000 for 20-year employees...whoop-de-freaking do.  It's nice and maybe someone can pay off some debt or buy the kids new bikes, but it hardly helps long term.
t1_dsw0c2x	0	*	Most voter Id laws were just passed recently.  Suppressing voter Id laws are the exception.  The entire world has voter Id laws.  Voter ID laws do not inherently disenfranchise voters.  
t1_dsvqdbp	0	*	In what way? 
t1_dsuydl5	1	*	Cool man....so shut it down? I don't see what the big deal is
t1_dsut5d0	1	*	Why indeed?
t1_dsxt5v2	0	*	so basically your defending companies paying their employees wages where they cant live hardly at all. congrats.
t1_dsuz815	0	*	I will rephrase. You said the cost of 40 to 60% of 54 people staying illegally was significant. Where is your source for that?
t1_dsuyak8	0	*	It's **26 times bigger**. That's a lot bigger.
t1_dsvz21j	0	*	You're canadian? Then kindly butt the fuck out of the conversation like you have skin in the game. 
t1_dsuupv7	0	*	We are talking* people on visas not illegals, focus.    Also, so youre saying I would be paying for their healthcare. Thanks for making my point. 
t1_dsuue2b	0	*	Do you have any audio or source? I haven't heard him say anything about low skilled germans vs Haitians. Let's stick to facts.
t1_dsv5ly5	1	*	No no no, heil is *their* catch phrase.
t1_dsuv4vv	0	*	Look at the overstay rate. For Canada is less than 1.5%. For Haiti that number is around 40%
t1_dsv6e3k	0	*	Or negotiated a better deal for climate accords?
t1_dsuyk8q	0	*	> our immigration policy doesnt strictly go by who has the darkest skin or which country is the poorest  Couldve fooled me 
t1_dsysv7u	0	*	Yep the hospital is a country with laws. 
t1_dsux2m3	0	*	Random shit like proving you wrong? Yea, so random.
t1_dsuumy7	1	*	If you still support trump at this point, you're either an idiot or a predator trying to profit off the show
t1_dsuv1yc	0	*	You joke but it probably will
t1_dsw2sja	0	*	god you are annoying
t1_dswu7r7	0	*	You don't think it has *anything* to do with the comments he made?
t1_dsvahbf	0	*	Even Putin isn't that stupid. Nobody sane is going to start flinging nukes around. Clinton isn't known for having toddler-like temper tantrums like a certain gigantic man-baby we all know.
t1_dsuy5yi	0	*	The emergency room isn't welfare, hospitals are private. 
t1_dsvbz2o	0	*	Gave 2 examples. Opposite examples. 
t1_dt1fek7	0	*	For an idiot you sure read into things a lot,  your thoughts are wrong but their still thoughts.  What a twat.  Edit:    You even call people beta cucks?  You are a fucking loser, lol...
t1_dsv76kp	1	*	That's true, since the birth of the country the natives have suffered because of immigrants.
t1_dsvowfh	0	*	If anything, requiring no skills should be attractive, because there's no cost associated with starting. 
t1_dsuszm4	0	*	Im angry that they stole the million dollars from me not the 20 dollars. 
t1_dsvbjvn	0	*	So you talk to dogs, but somehow think you're qualified to make judgments on immigration?   I'll keep doing this till you slip.
t1_dsv4ki3	0	*	It's no coincidence when you call anyone who thinks differently than you a neo-nazi and white supremist.
t1_dsus334	1	*	Thats because its easier to get immigrants to work than pay more to get Americans to work. If it was way harder to Mexicans to work, he would have solved the labor shortage by raising the pay. 
t1_dsv55en	1	*	I, don't see it? Can you quote or something?
t1_dsvsmng	0	*	How exactly did he make NorKo look better than us? That's the same line of logic as Saudi Arabia does more to support women's rights than us because they finally let women drive last year
t1_dsw9lpb	0	*	That wasn't the point of the discussion. It was how whites are less likely to take those positions than minorities. In the instance the minority is Hispanics.
t1_dswrwev	0	*	Guns aren't a problem.  There, now what? 
t1_dsvr6jc	1	*	Thanks for the sources, I will have to take time to read them.
t1_dsv1ocg	1	*	darn it!!!!!! that is what i meant ... freaking heck AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH flipping even!!! I'm even from Maryland and been to both a bunch of times. 
t1_dsvlt13	1	*	There *might* have been an undertone of snark in my comment.
t1_dsutvk5	0	*	At least HE has sources.
t1_dsv9sxx	1	*	Fair enough
t1_dsvbq2i	0	*	Unless youre referencing sowell, the average economist has zero idea what he's talking about.
t1_dsvq1mn	1	*	What is my argument?
t1_dsyss2u	0	*	lol ok, so no arguments to my points gotcha, so you can't dispute it.  Talk to ya later lol
t1_dsursot	0	*	So where do you draw the line?
t1_duj9g30	1	*	For most of the world (when viewed by the west)?  Yeah, pretty much.  That's why pretty much nobody in the west who matters is pushing for a world government this side of the 70s.
t1_dt638p4	0	*	They arent saying its explicitly false, theyre using vague terms to paint it that way. Any other event or reporting of the wall has this as open information.
t1_dtu1rcb	0	*	If morality is truly subjective like you said you think then it doesn't matter how we arrive at it.   How are you not getting this? 
t1_dtt015i	1	*	Sure.
t1_dtt1ge0	0	*	That's not the promotion of racist nationalism which is all that I've proposed to ban by virtue of its readily apparent negative effect on society.
t1_dsvjbdz	0	*	Ouch During our study period of 1998-2008 nice try buddy.  go educate yourself better hilarious irony.
t1_dswhxjj	0	*	And still without an argument. Sad
t1_dsv5ane	0	*	Ok.
t1_dsxc9q9	0	*	The extremists on both sides behave that way. And sadly there seems to be fewer and fewer people who aren't extremely ____wing.
t1_dsx3yut	0	*	Oh man something else we disagree about, I'm an atheist 
t1_dsy0yv7	0	*	I prefer this political activism.   https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uPqnrQfm8oU
t1_dsw74ld	1	*	Yes those are all things you do 
t1_dsvm7l5	0	*	I don't eaither, but non violent they are not.  This extends though, because antifa fights everyone, not just the dregs of society.
t1_dsvv0y8	1	*	Read my comment, the guy wasn't actually advocating for white genocide
t1_dsvtvu3	0	*	Well, not any of the developed countries. But some countries, sure! 
t1_dsvktbq	1	*	>Ad hominem  The lack of self awareness is astounding.
t1_dslfrnt	1	*	As in central asian countries should send more people over
t1_dslc7tg	1	*	Haitians do. That's why theyre so poor.
t1_dskjetu	0	*	What, pray tell, have I suggested? I've only stated we don't have the resources to deal with a lot of problems.
t1_dsly0bz	1	*	Your best just isnt good enough.
t1_dskrftd	1	*	Okay
t1_dskwjrh	1	*	You got it u political genius!
t1_dskrdt9	1	*	Tldr
t1_dskiz5n	0	*	Which I think is a bad idea, and we should have tax brackets on the rich be higher, as well as making bonuses be taxed, and taxing stock market income above 1 million dollars per year.
t1_du1o7nm	1	*	Thanks for the laugh.
t1_dud7erk	1	*	Thank you for the reply..interesting stuff!
t1_du0wiiy	0	*	The vision never diiiees

t1_dsxa50p	0	*	Nice Turkish propaganda. Do you have credible sources for this? If yes, please provide them. 
t1_dsxoqq2	0	*	Also, how is it not a place of power to be the lead rocketry engineer at NASA during the space race?
t1_dsy69l9	0	*	It wouldn't have mattered if they knew if they weren't cowards. 
t1_dsxgt0z	0	*	They're not arbitrary, they declared war because of Poland, and none of that stuff helped Poland at all. 
t1_dsy5pux	0	*	If anyone has a real gripe its the Czechs. Basically given to Germany and then the Russians, even though part of it WAS liberated by the USA. 
t1_dsy1r0w	1	*	That's funny, that's exactly the way I feel about you LARPing cunts.  Also, 'pre-emptive self-defense'?  I didn't know Dubya was a source of leftist political philosophy.
t1_dsx98vl	0	*	They made no logical points. He's wrong. 
t1_dt0ux9m	1	*	appears to be a sort of speculative/fantasy historical setting.. my brother reads Guy Gavriel Kay and the book description for Neck of Ivory made me think of that writer.
t1_dsx62qv	0	*	So why did you comment? Don't waste my time 
t1_dsyteya	0	*	Anybody who thinks the Nazis should of been wiped out is a nazi.  Do you think members of ISIS should be hired by the US govt too?
t1_dsgsnp7	0	*	Comically missing the point.
t1_dsgsmk6	0	*	I've seen everything from grainy 240p to crisp 4k video coming from Syria.
t1_dsgqyy5	1	*	I criticized behavior which is motivated by religious teachings, in service of criticizing those religious teachings. I love how you're criticizing me for something you imagine I would do.
t1_dsiovq4	1	*	I think if the Parliament tried to get rid of the monarch the Canadians would be one of the last they would be expecting to see.
t1_dstqp2w	1	*	Prophet, sure. Main leader of the religion? No. Mohammed is of higher importance than Jesus in the Islamic faith. Just like Jesus is more important than Moses in the Christian faith.
t1_dssmvxj	1	*	watching mortality is like watching a horror movie.  You get to see/experience fatal events without being in actual danger yourself. adrenaline, morbid curiosity, etc
t1_dsuq1rm	1	*	Word from the man himself! Thanks for the information!! 
t1_dsspqlr	0	*	Yep!  And if you're really like me, let's celebrate with a nice brown ale. Or some cookies, whatever.
t1_dst4oik	0	*	Anus
t1_dsskzl1	0	*	What I'm hearing is this aspect of my religion's holy text doesn't make sense to me, so I'm assuming it's not supposed to be literal
t1_dssx1xz	0	*	Like I said, it's almost like conquering is different in the modern stage... not expecting anything resembling intelligent discourse from you so please continue to disappoint. 
t1_dsstcd7	1	*	God damn you're weird go bug someone else. 
t1_dstbau1	0	*	Ok. I'll choose. Give me number 1, 2, and 3 of your favourite ones if you source it from any satire sites. Or just link me one website that does it
t1_dswy8yp	1	*	Increasing suffering. 
t1_dssqv1a	0	*	I just read through it again (One of my favorites). It was where Jean and Cosette were escaping from Javert over the wall. It was a direct quote, so Im pretty confident lol
t1_dsszlil	1	*	If we ignore reality it will go away yeah? 
t1_dssqvj7	1	*	I guess I'm the only one who googled shit entertainment
t1_dssmhlb	1	*	The thing is evangelical views in the US affect US legislation as well as social contact. The LGBT community had to fight tooth and nail just to get rights such as gay marriage. 
t1_dssqx8q	1	*	Ok we are. Definitely related  ...... WE are awesome
t1_dsz3azp	1	*	You're right.
t1_duox787	0	*	Do WHAT - please mr badass - do WHAT differently
t1_dt405qe	0	*	That is how the Syrian war began, yes. With the abduction and execution of young men from their homes without cause, something Im sure youd applaud as a Chinese government sycophant. 
t1_dt4roxc	1	*	Name ***one*** Russian troll (not hacker, not smuggler, not credit card skimmer, not some other criminal) who has been extradited to the US from Europe. Just one.
t1_dt42alm	0	*	No, speech is free here. 
t1_dtg85hb	0	*	I am well aware of what is currently the case. That does mean it should be. A proportionate allocation of electoral votes on a state by state basis is what I would consider an improvement.
t1_dtg47mw	1	*	Its fine, no need to apologize, it would be very easy to infer that. Its just conservative here and conservative there and elsewhere in Europe mean different things

t1_duamo1w	0	*	Oh yeah, there was a lot of hand wringing over it, because the evangelicals *do not* like Trump. But they could handle him being President if it meant they got their Supreme Court pick.
t1_duajpgm	1	*	Ok couldnt tell man lol
t1_duaco2z	0	*	/u/sydofbee just pointed out twice that Germany has no problem ignoring these so-called simple market economics. Perhaps, if the facts don't fit, it actually isn't the fault of mass migration?

t1_du4ebpa	0	*	As long they obey the law, the public can do whatever they want.
t1_dv4pkvd	0	*	Oh my god man. Why are you doing this? The PM is appounted by the queen after their  party **wins an election**. Its a fucking formality. England is not a theocracy.

t1_dtw8q0f	0	*	I get it, and I apologize if I'm feverish about this, but dude we can't let them off the hook, and Russian interference is a serious threat to multiple democracies.

t1_dv20fa0	0	*	Yes it is, and it breads a culture of gossip and trial by public opinion. Only the rich can protect themselves, it's an absolute mess.

t1_dv0zock	1	*	Thank you
t1_dv0zhzf	1	*	I think its probably more likely she anti estabishment and they are afraid of her. So they let this stuff happen not realising its just selling her political narrative for her.
t1_dv0zknh	1	*	Thank you.
t1_dv265x6	0	*	I wonder, I have compulsory voting in my country so I am confident that whoever is in power gained consensus because about 91 per cent of everyone over 18 voted.  In other countries Im never sure.  
t1_dv11rus	0	*	> Not sure why you jumped from racists to Nazis.  Because we're talking about Le Pen, and there are more problems there than just pure racism.
t1_dv1pzoc	0	*	That would be Birmingham area. But it is not uncommon among fundies.
t1_dv1chms	0	*	Also what other people think is irrelevant. North Koreans think that its not their right to not be rounded up and put in a prison camp but ill still support their rights.

t1_dsibfy2	1	*	Awesome, thank you!
t1_dshz0lw	1	*	Yes. There is no other explanation, IMO, that makes sense. What difference does a couple million dollar tax break mean to a billionaire? I think theyre all mentally ill. 
t1_dsi09mg	0	*	> I do not believe the world would be brighter or darker were Moscow or Beijing to gain or lose influence.  ....really? Those states don't respect civil rights for jack shit.

t1_dss3goa	0	*	Perhaps currently, but suicide bombing has been used in different methods by many different terrorist groups and militaries. Look up Proxy Bombing by the IRA, or the concept of kamikaze during WW2.

t1_du4xh8c	0	*	Or maybe teachers unions are one of the primary donors to and political organizers for Democrats in the state and throwing more money at teachers is a kickback to the unions.
t1_du4rovv	0	*	Clearly the dog is compromised and must be euthanized immediately.
t1_du34pto	0	*	/u/SingleWordRebut attacked the structure of your argument, not you. That's not an ad hominem argument.
t1_dsbg9z4	0	*	I wouldn't want Bill anywhere near the WH again and HRC is fake as f.  Trump will split the GOP and make sure they don't get the presidency again for a long time to come.
t1_dulwl6g	0	*	As I asked, why do you think anything needs to replace it. Multiple countries where the largest religion is lack thereof are clearly perfectly fine without christian thinking.

t1_ds5glv7	1	*	It has a tremendous bearing. You are just repeating CIA talking points.
t1_ds602u2	0	*	No sir, Nazis are evil, people who call for the murder of innocent cops are evil. Cops who take advantage of their responsibilities are evil. Not everyone listed here is a part of the same group. 
t1_ds54v0n	0	*	Apparently, a lot. He doesn't seem to understand where he is going wrong. Just blame the liberals seems to be the way he is going about it. Bit sad actually. 
t1_ds4w7ug	0	*	That's not really a source, that's just some asshole belching numbers without a source, something that guy is know to do.

t1_ds4yqha	1	*	Yes, diesel electric subs are much quieter
t1_ds4ua4b	0	*	But it's also not a very insightful statement if you accept that the population is largely anti-Trump in the first place.
t1_ds4uppz	0	*	> Daniel Shaver  Well how many times do you have to watch the news to know not to do stupid shit or reach for your pants around cops? Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.

t1_ds4xlo5	0	*	I'd argue that military service during wartime isn't something a poor person would pick, given better alternatives. It's the lack of better alternatives that forces the decision.

t1_ds4ztri	0	*	You must be early-mid 20s then and are just starting to figure out how the world works. I assure you it has been this way for many people, for many years. Also, confirmation bias is a helluva drug.

t1_ds95b1t	1	*	Lmao what?

t1_ds4rtmm	0	*	A comparable one, like to Iran right now. 
t1_ds4wdmx	0	*	Yes?  It would be great if the Iranian government didn't kill all the protesters.
t1_ds4tx6n	1	*	I lost a lot of money to you when I was a kid.
t1_ds5hz2c	0	*	*sigh* I doubt you are actually foolish enough to not understand what I mean, so you must be acting as such for your own purposes.  Good luck with your propagandizing!
t1_ds55wbu	0	*	I think that protesting is a valid platform of requesting change. Voting doesn't do you any good when votes are suppressed and you can't talk to everyone, unlike Fox News.

t1_ds4qsgm	0	*	We have someone defending the Russian communist economy and comparing it as equal to the US capitalist economy.  You're not going to find much intelligent debate here.

t1_dsur18i	1	*	Right. Im sure you made it through high school.

t1_dt5xj6r	0	*	My account is old and I think your argument is terrible and your accusations are disgusting.  Am I a Russian bot?
t1_dt6fpiw	1	*	Got it. So every opinion you have ever had has been backed by concrete evidence and you have never used secondary sources to develop said opinions, right? That seems to be what youre implying.
t1_dt69gxm	0	*	So, she doesn't have the right to run for President as does every other qualified American?  There were at least five Dems that started the primaries.  Perhaps you'd prefer the Russian system?

t1_dsb8szb	0	*	You are making shit up   You made a statement you can't back up.   Show me where anyone thinks they should get representation but the other side shouldn't 
t1_dsb58sz	1	*	i definitely remember the IP stuff but i felt like that all kinda rolled into the CISPA, PIPA, SOPA stuff and the TPP was on a global scale.  
t1_dsb0hrj	0	*	Right...and when our country turns to have the same disparities and issues as the country they immigrated from? 
t1_dsbik39	1	*	I have! That's usually my go to question at the end. What is the purpose of this deception. That usually shuts her up.
t1_dsbatsh	0	*	The globe manufacturers, obviously. Globe ... globalists. Coincidence? 
t1_dsbfjjj	0	*	I'm not trying to convince anyone. All I'm saying is that your original point was stupid, doesn't bring anything to the discussion and you should probably reflect a bit more before commenting.
t1_dsaymom	0	*	This does not equate paying rent with paying property tax.  This is SOP in just about every business in existence.
t1_dsbg2xg	1	*	im sure some people do, and those people are able to name legitimate reasons for disliking her rather than repeating talking points from dishonest Facebook memes.
t1_dsd6eps	0	*	Yeah I agree with you doing the same, walls work clearly my sources can't change your delusion.
t1_dsb2k08	1	*	Thanks, I asked them repeatedly what makes it unconstitutional. Mind you, I don't know either way - that's why I asked.
t1_dsc8a9s	0	*	You guys really suck his dick non-stop, don't you? It has to be chapped at this point. Trump this, Trump that.
t1_dsb6tr4	0	*	I did and I made it, you build a wall people will find other ways to enter.  Do you think a wall stops illegal immigration?    
t1_dsb3ulo	0	*	https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/burden-of-proof  Let me know if that helps you. 
t1_dscqodh	0	*	oh ok oh ok.   So in my research Trump said Mexico would pay for it, and Mexico repeatedly said they wouldn't, but then Trump kept on saying the same thing.   That uh, that check with your research?  
t1_dsblc26	1	*	To be fair, plenty of casinos went under in Atlantic City, you can't discount that 
t1_dsb8axg	0	*	Other than that is how America was built? Come one. You can troll better than that. 
t1_dsg7fjy	1	*	You are ignorant now. Have fun with that. 
t1_dtxidqg	1	*	Agreed. I'll just ignore him
t1_dtxiy6q	0	*	Ok.... are you getting to the point where you prove half the UK are English born like you claimed. Not England but the UK as whole. 
t1_dtyk9jr	0	*	How? 
t1_dtyla3l	1	*	It's called a humble brag. Are we 6th? I thought we were higher. Still damn good, and they want to cut off funding to us for being a sanctuary state for immigrants
t1_dtxkq5b	0	*	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarcasm
t1_dtxjt7l	1	*	Yeah I tried my damnedest to get an Estonian to join me in America but she said as long as Article V of NATO is in effect she has to stay. 
t1_dtxjt77	1	*	You want the ol' Maple-scented Card.
t1_dtxmdmq	0	*	then stop commenting dip-shit. 
t1_du0thjo	1	*	Yeah for sure, I guess I just misinterpreted. 
t1_dtxva0d	0	*	You're assuming every one in England was born here. That isn't the case. Did you pass GCSE anything?
t1_dtxg5a8	1	*	Just trying to correct your misunderstanding matey, no need to get all technical on me.
t1_dtxl7my	0	*	Who's reduced who to what? It would seem you can't form constructive sentences anymore.  I'm satisfied you are the case and point to be very careful about any future immigration deals. Be gone child.
t1_dtxy0yz	1	*	Well sure, like movie stars. Or Microsoft. But all the prestige from ages past where they actually ruled is an absurd thing to continue to ascribe them.
t1_dtxhki3	0	*	Ah yes, I disagree if you ignore religion, lol. 
t1_dtyf57w	0	*	If you don't want to read my posts and read my entire argument, don't jump to incorrect conclusions fool.
t1_dtyf45n	1	*	As I said, not my fucking problem. My point was valid regardless of your stupid condescending crap which frankly has not contributed to the discussion (again, standard internet idiot)
t1_du1bij6	1	*	Your response is funny.  You mention your opinions, say theyre literally not arguable, and then post a link to a map of presidential republics, etc. 
t1_dtxqbxq	0	*	That's because there's no debate to be had, England does not equal the UK, however much north americans and continental europeans fail to see this!
t1_dtxhiwa	0	*	Lmao I'm done here, maybe run back to /Pol/ or r/donald or something because I'm not here to have irrelevant conversations with idiots
t1_dtxj0bb	1	*	How about the shared language? Food? Sports? Political system? You seem to be confusing racially and culturally.
t1_dtxicqh	0	*	No, you steered it there, you forced the conversation. This is not how you bring up issues that you want to discuss, that discussion belongs in another thread, and not this one.
t1_dswkw5l	0	*	Lmao, you're acting like you're magically immune to being fucked over by neocons.  I dont understand why people go to bat for people who actively want to restrict their rights and well being.
t1_dswrjzo	0	*	So either way they are losing employment due to their lack of religious freedom. 
t1_dswwxjm	0	*	In Canada that is not the law. As long as the umbilical cord is attached it is not a human being according to Canadian law
t1_dswqmd3	0	*	So no genuine response then?
t1_dt02sc7	1	*	You too! Have a good night! (Or day, depending where you are. Lol) 
t1_dsworue	0	*	Never. It's a cold and matter of fact approach, but a fetus does not have feelings let alone consciousness, hopes, desires. It is merely an undeveloped organism. There is nothing lost. 
t1_dswv4yw	0	*	I invited you to clarify and you used it as an excuse to bail.
t1_dsx83f3	1	*	You would be correct!  Thanks for the clarification!
t1_dsxr6v0	0	*	All that and you still don't know what infanticide means.   LOL
t1_dsxrb26	1	*	So you *wouldn't* object to this same policy being applied to pro-choicers?
t1_dswpyzg	0	*	You can rephrase your belief in 1000 ways, but the fact is still that you cannot conclusively say there's no God without having all knowledge
t1_dswru27	0	*	Nope. Its also not a first term abortion, which is by far the most common. 
t1_dsxecb8	0	*	If you're entire argument is bolstered only by nonsensical parallels, it's not a very good argument. I would be surprised if anyone considered a 1 year old, let alone an adult as a fetus.
t1_dswr0ee	0	*	If you're not going to answer the question, move along.
t1_dsxfpta	1	*	Hit the nail on the head.
t1_dsws2lh	1	*	This isn't really about that? 
t1_dswj22p	0	*	That sounds like a very specific example where a pastor was contracted by the city to perform these marriages...A regular pastor who works through a church would not have had to do so.
t1_dswovdh	0	*	> unnecessary death is bad  I ask you why death is bad and your response is that unnecessary death is bad.  Tautologies aren't feelings, I'll give you that. They are, however, horrible arguments.
t1_dsxevi8	0	*	So right to life is dependent of the State's assignment of identity?
t1_dsz3dl8	0	*	How am I being obtuse? I'm asking a question.
t1_dswj2p2	0	*	Ahh, you can't point out when someone's beliefs are contradicted by reality! /S
t1_dswqv7z	1	*	They aren't.
t1_dsxttxy	0	*	Hey bro, its Friday and Im leaving work. Thanks for keeping me entertained today while at work. Enjoy your weekend. 
t1_dsxbals	0	*	Also I've won this argument by any metric.  You've yet to disprove anything I've said, you've just made strawman arguments or just flat out stupid arguments due to poor reading comprehension.
t1_dswr7hz	0	*	Regardless, had there ever been a case where one person has tried to force a living person to donate their organ to save another's life?
t1_dswtnig	0	*	I don't think the ease with which it could be changed = its meaningless. Its still held with the responsibility of its purpose.
t1_dsxpxsm	0	*	>To disregard the mother's actual sapience for the nonexistent sapience of a potential sapience is morally wrong.  For a lot of people, it's a far more complex issue than that.
t1_dswu86z	0	*	It costs way more to deny health care, so I am more than happy to pay my fair share for any and all medical services.
t1_dsx2h9j	0	*	I don't think anyone should be forced to do carry a baby to term. However at a certain point abortion becomes too risky on the mother's life to perform and is therefore no longer an option.
t1_dsymff6	1	*	And you can keep pretending that fetuses are babies.
t1_dswmyes	0	*	Yeah, it's our constitution. It's the source of our laws. 
t1_dswlnng	0	*	12 people does not constitute data.  12 people constitutes 12 points of datum.
t1_dswncux	0	*	Because it was that way for so long despite it being a human right. Just because someone says something is a right it doesn't mean it is in practice.
t1_dsxl3tp	1	*	Do you think death could be defined as a cessation of brain waves if it were possible for brain activity to resume in the future?
t1_dsxs3gl	0	*	And that's fine, people are free to do whatever they want. They just shouldn't receive government funding to help them oppose existing laws. Which is the whole point of this check box.
t1_dswpk42	1	*	That's the entire point. You are forcing people to, in essence, *excise* a politically undesirable belief...or lie and put on the appearance of excising a politically undesirable belief.
t1_dsxfmqm	0	*	Alright dude you dont get it and you dont care whatever. Just remember not to turn to america for help or to come here when canada hits the shit.
t1_dszwjtp	0	*	And my opinion, and the law, is that in this matter it is only my opinion. I, and the court, have no right to prevent abortion. 
t1_dsxc293	0	*	That's a moral issue, which doesn't necessarily matter with regards to the law. 
t1_dswpzkj	0	*	So only the women get a get out of jail for card. Sounds sexist to me...
t1_dsxxixr	0	*	Just FYI, Sperm has DNA. Having human DNA should not be the defining factor seperating murder vs not. Since you can go to jail for murdering non humans.
t1_dsxpw6k	0	*	Yeah I saw that little bit.  That's not much in the ways of anything.  Samaritan's Purse hands out between 100M-200M shoe boxes a year.
t1_dswpt5n	0	*	My line is survival outside of the womb.
t1_dsy7x8q	0	*	When it's born.   There's a pretty clear line 
t1_dswlnry	1	*	Not a huge concern to have the government step in. 
t1_dswplyk	0	*	Are those not viable human beings within another human being?  No?  Then why do you assume that I think they are less deserving of rights?
t1_dt1bo7y	1	*	I do go for the compassionate approach in real life and I am empathetic as I can possibly be. If I did that here though no one would have tested my beliefs ;)
t1_dswrn4w	0	*	Ah yes, change the subject once you realize making abortion illegal leads to forced pregnancies and deaths.  It's almost like forcing women to be pregnant and give birth is . . . evil . . .
t1_dsx8udp	0	*	Why thank you.   But that doesn't answer the question.   If it's not a baby, not a person, why would someone feel bad about reliving themselves of such a tumor? 
t1_dswvvgu	1	*	What? You're saying that the law of Canada represents the final moral truth of the human race, you should be prepared to back up such an outrageous claim
t1_dswq0vu	0	*	You contradicted everything you already said. So they CAN be defunded for being pro-life
t1_dswoows	0	*	Yeah it sucks to be reminded that there are people out there who honestly think right wing parties are better for the poor. 
t1_dsx00si	1	*	Ive put out a number of responses so far in this thread addressing these concerns - if youre interested Ill add an edit with these responses, Im on mobile at the moment so its a bit tricky.
t1_dsx3zju	0	*	Yes I know what viable means. What makes viability your standard
t1_dswzd1w	1	*	I always have a quotation for everything, it saves original thinking. ...
t1_dswmekh	0	*	At what point is a person a person? If you took a recently fertilized egg out of a woman, would it be able to survive? Of course not, because it's not a person, it's a lump of cells.
t1_dswuahx	1	*	The government won't pay for it.
t1_dswqyzk	0	*	I mean, the US has had legal abortion since roe vs wade in 1973, even before Canada if I'm not mistaking. 
t1_dsx8ylu	0	*	That is exactly why you speak up, as you have just done,  and educate people so we more fully understand the situation and know what we can do to support the fight.   So, what exactly can we do? 
t1_dswp52v	0	*	What is your point? The idea that I am trying to convey is that illegal or not meth and coke and heroin are so addictive that blanket legalization will simply lead to more ODs and more addiction. 
t1_dswylbh	1	*	...that MIGHT develop. 
t1_dsx0yzh	1	*	There are democrats that are prolife, I don't need to provide a list of elected representatives to prove they exist, especially because I am one of them.
t1_dsxe8qc	1	*	You have yet to provide logic. 
t1_dsz4gej	0	*	And I have a fuck ton is savings and can retire happily. Meanwhile you spend all your money on games like a child. How does it feel being a virgin? LOL
t1_dswr4fb	0	*	Because the right to medical services and control of your body is a human right, and killing the unborn is right wing propaganda.
t1_dswpoil	0	*	I plan to, and I daresay I'll enjoy it.
t1_dsxc4iu	0	*	define autonomous human life please
t1_dswmxi0	1	*	Doesn't matter what I think, only matters what I can prove. 
t1_dt136or	0	*	Do you speak out about those killed in war?  Perhaps Taliban soldiers?  How about those on death row?  Somehow I doubt it.
t1_dsxel5g	1	*	I'm sure you believe that.
t1_dsws1tk	0	*	I clearly stated that you *didnt* offer any valid arguments. Whats so confusing for you?   
t1_dswoxuy	1	*	Yeah definitely, because the WHO are just a bunch of dumb biased journalist trolls.  http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2017/unsafe-abortions-worldwide/en/
t1_dsxeiac	0	*	They already did. A woman's right to choose is set in stone. 
t1_dswq66n	0	*	As a citizen her rights are of paramount importance too, not just her physical safety.    
t1_dtddkwm	1	*	You said the DNC accused the last two Republican presidents of being elected illegitimatly. Asking you to prove it is exactly what I started with.
t1_dtcv8fa	0	*	This fantasy has proof, so im not the one crying here
t1_dtfz3d1	0	*	>8.4 million.  Putting him in the top one percent. Try again.

t1_ds2757f	1	*	You want to stop fascists?! Stop the idiot in your mirror. 
t1_ds1xht0	1	*	Germany disallows censorship yet they still do it. Canada and India don't actually. Limit any speech besides yelling bomb in super public areas 
t1_duz5e06	0	*	don't confuse disliking a government with disliking a people.  russians deserve better than putin.

t1_dt9nl2e	0	*	You still dont seem to be comprehending the conversation.

t1_dt95i6t	0	*	Thats where your critical thinking drops off; this is trump, your simply looking for something that reaffirms your opinion.   Never mind theres no proof behind these claims, youve bought in.
t1_dt9cdkv	1	*	But the thing is that his base will *never* care about that. And he has a large base. 
t1_dtef688	0	*	> facts     Oh, I see the problem now.  I think we could have avoided this whole discussion if you had simply looked up the definitions of 'fact' and 'hearsay' in the dictionary prior. 
t1_dt9cgdk	0	*	That explains why the NYT has been missing their revenue forecasts.
t1_dt9sitx	0	*	They're clearly not trying to have an honest conversation but OP is a class act in not giving a fuck 
t1_dtahulu	0	*	Okay dude. Have fun living in whatever fantasy world you choose to. I'm sure things there are more comforting to your limited worldview. 
t1_dta92yu	1	*	patience of a saint right here.
t1_dtb5kd2	1	*	Talking about you. And your last post made my point. 
t1_dt9bq8o	0	*	Your guy told you that he heard it from his guy right...?  You can't confirm third hand info.
t1_dt95yv1	1	*	Do you have any proof theyre not lying?   Both can be answered the same.
t1_ds3gcre	0	*	  Until *you* can link to some evidence or studies of the problem you are describing, I'm done.
t1_duoxclh	0	*	But at some point you have to draw the line, if you endlessly debate the gray than what you get is deadlock, no progress.
t1_duogkh8	0	*	I just reiterated why he has popular support. Odd you call it propaganda when you literally just claimed it wasn't propagated by his campaign at all. 
t1_dtq1kfr	1	*	It is possible to convey sarcasm through text, because tone of voice is not part of the definition of sarcasm.   You're wrong. Give it up.
t1_dtq7pim	0	*	Are you actually fuckin serious?
t1_dtnixji	1	*	Good. Hopefully the rest are just as reputation ruining for the Republican Party is this one has been
t1_dtdlhwx	0	*	No, you specifically insulted the media *I* watched, as in it was directed at my ability to vet the media I consume. Not only was it an off handed insult, it was also baseless and inherently wrong.
t1_dtew4ef	0	*	> Do you support the fascist regime that's killing people in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Yemen and Afghanistan?  Can I introduce you to the Mossad? Seriously isnt Bill O'Reilly on?

t1_dsusvbs	1	*	Whatevs 
t1_dsk5ta6	0	*	I gave you a source from a reputable publication saying exactly what I claimed: 21 hacks on voter registries with manipulation discovered in at least one. If that isn't enough for you try Google.
t1_dsjx89f	0	*	You keep mentioning Clinton and 'rapist' in the same sentence.  Do you mean Bill?
t1_dsiykx1	1	*	It's a heck of a lot of fun as a day out. You grab some friends, head to the stadium and spend the day outdoors drinking, talking shit and chilling out. But I'd never watch it on television.

t1_dudre3i	0	*	I mean I can accuse you of hate speech and sue you for it, doesn't mean you'll get convicted.  It's also highly questionable to equate anyone who speaks Arabic to a rapist, like von Storch did.
t1_dtx6ogr	1	*	Yeah I though that was obvious
t1_ds7p4r1	1	*	What are the Taliban then? 
t1_ds70lcd	0	*	It depends on which part of Afghanistan you visit. Go north, and you're correct, go south and you're completely wrong. 
t1_ds7nbah	0	*	So I watched the whole thing.  My biggest concern with this is that its RT, which has a massive anti-American agenda (even moreso back then). Any chance you could get just one more source? :)
t1_dsa96f3	0	*	I'm just saying that a country's 'interests' are vast and complicated, and ascribing a religious, ideological and even a humanitarian bent to those actions is vastly over-simplifying.

t1_dsjanqe	0	*	A vast majority of people dont buy guns because of the fear of bears though.  
t1_dsjfwhx	0	*	So deal with that, don't come out here discouraging people by telling them it doesn't matter. All that does is ensure nothing will change. 
t1_dsjwbwh	0	*	It certainly didn't seem to be a problem to me while i was there.
t1_dsjyykb	1	*	Not a fan of pussyhats but Id prefer someone wearing a pussyhat to someone that admires Trump for being a lying, blowhard snake oil salesman, as if its something to aspire to be.
t1_dsjxob1	0	*	If his methods include colluding with hostile,foreign powers to get elected than yes I dont like them and he should be removed. 
t1_dsjuncg	0	*	Denial  Is  A river  In  Egypt
t1_dsjlx8a	1	*	You can be straight up arrested here, barred from serving alcohol for a period of time, the business can lose its liquor license.  
t1_dsjnzmy	1	*	And Britain First. Can't forget that stellar source.
t1_dsjtyvf	0	*	I got a question. How many completely, provably, false news stories about Muslims in Sweden would I need to show you before you would accept there is someone out there trying to stir the pot?
t1_dsjkejz	0	*	A **crime** is an un**law**ful act punishable by a state or other authority. If there is no **law** there is no **crime**.   What part do you not get?
t1_dsjjsm5	0	*	Nah i have access to basic health and human services
t1_dsjojq0	0	*	You know how fast the building fell? It fell at free fall speeds. Look into it instead of using sophomoric speech to degrade an argument. 
t1_dsjtm2n	0	*	Lol. I'm not going to read pages of half- translated gibberish. Why don't you pull out the relevant  figures and cite them. Where are you from in Sweden?
t1_dskblsa	0	*	I visited both. Belgium was safer and nicer and classier than the Netherlands. 
t1_dskic8n	1	*	Yeah but if we could nip it in the bud, maybe we wouldnt have a racist President. 
t1_dskbp02	0	*	The American people are sheep. They're comfortable, rich, working. It's like the Romans, they're happy with bread and their spectator sports. The Super Bowl means more to them than any right.
t1_du6h1sh	0	*	Says the guy who needs the rails to be right because he's nitpicking at a month old non story. 
t1_dsjmitd	1	*	Good for both for you, every bit helps
t1_dsjou9d	0	*	So then you are arguing that inciting violence alone is not speech that infringes on someone else's rights? 
t1_dsk65kn	1	*	Houden zo
t1_dsjielv	0	*	May I ask you what exactly your point is? That Democrats are worse than Republicans? That they are equally bad?
t1_dsjp3xu	1	*	I mean, that's certainly true, but I wish it were something you took to heart instead of just parroting to keep from critically engaging your own flawed ideology.
t1_dsjrnyw	1	*	not to mention mentioning grenade specific attacks does nothing to support the claim that there was virtually no crime in Sweeden before the recent waves of immigration.
t1_dsjffe9	0	*	Sorry. Any elaboration wouldn't be a true elaboration. Only true elaborators can give true elaborations and sadly people claim I am not a true elaborator.  Sorry. Truly.
t1_dt2d0o8	1	*	Didn't happen.
t1_dv0u9iw	1	*	Tbh we all might lucky and China eats itself again when the housing bubble pops 
t1_ds81iw4	1	*	Looool wow kid you're so edgy! /s
t1_ds7kqfj	1	*	It's pointless dude. This thread is a vapers echochamber.

t1_du0bx4a	1	*	U0001f44d
t1_du0j1z7	1	*	Ya, I thought you were serious (because, tbh, I thought I was being fair) but the massive amounts of downvotes for what seemed like a reasonable exchange left me unsure.
t1_dumc8n9	1	*	Yes, omniscience is the theoretical way to prove a negative.  Unfortunately that's a practical impossibility on this subject, even for government entities, let alone a reddit user.
t1_dsopbq1	0	*	For somebody claiming to have no say you sure were awfully determined to insist your side is best.
t1_dsphghp	1	*	Knowledge acquired in childhood is not soon forgotten.
t1_dsqlrtu	1	*	Do they exist? Yes. Is it reasonable to suggest that the people who disagree with you on the Israel situation do so out of hatred for the Jewish people? Not at all.
t1_dsosil7	0	*	I'm not even American.  Get fucked.    keep pretending that fuckall in donations is better than 30 + billion
t1_dv3yva1	0	*	I thought the article was about Uber? Why would he talk about another job?
t1_dv1br34	1	*	It's unreasonable to trust anything without evidence, but one can never really get anything without taking chances. Thank you for considering my points of view. 
t1_durt7zz	1	*	I'm from the US so maybe hang back a sec on that Euro education comment. 
t1_duxqqsh	0	*	the fact that we are talking homicide then you switched to suicide is telling.   suicides didnt go down because of gun restrictions. just gun suicides did.
t1_durly13	0	*	I live in Connecticut 
t1_durl92c	0	*	There is an inverse relationship between the number of guns in the US and our firearm homicide rate.  https://gundata.github.io/output_3_0.png  https://gundata.github.io/output_4_0.png 
t1_dur8kn0	1	*	I think this thread has given me more insight into the USA's education problem than its gun problem.
t1_dusslb1	1	*	You are right dead gun nuts who willingly enter a fight is much worse than dead schoolchildren. And obviously there is not course of action to take when police officers refuse to carry out their jobs.
t1_durq9z9	0	*	I didnt shoot it down. I am pessimistic that it would in practice be anything more than partisan politicians bickering though. 
t1_durbi1o	0	*	And if the people wish to change that the Constitution you so despise has a process for that purpose.
t1_dusphij	0	*	I've never had any of that happen and I live in a city that's been in the top ten for homicide per capital for the past two decades. Where the hell were you?
t1_duret5t	0	*	Maybe you should move
t1_dutesbr	0	*	So you think that the second amendment of the United States Constitution applies to people in China, Australia, UK and elsewhere?
t1_dus2x3d	1	*	> I'm actually curious though - are people allowed to buy rocket launches in the states?  Yes.  > Prevent != reduce. I never said prevent entirely, I said reduce.  Reduce != Less Crime either.
t1_dur99w1	1	*	Nah he's right man, different number. Pretty sure that means he wins and guns are safe                                                    /s
t1_duscojk	1	*	Please do tell me where in the Constitution you're granted the freedom for a peaceful and safe life. 
t1_dusloju	0	*	And you don't seem to care. Just like everyone else who wants knee jerk reaction laws put in place without knowing what they're talking about.   Wonderful. 
t1_durmevd	0	*	Yeah they dont sell assault rifles. Any place you can get those is at auction the need to pay the tax on them and inform your local sheriff.
t1_dus9mld	0	*	Ah, just a troll. Carry on then. 
t1_dus6kn4	1	*	I can't think of anywhere in the US I would be afraid to drive - and I've driven through South Central and the Bronx - but I can think of entire regions of Mexico where I wouldn't go.
t1_dus0zfq	0	*	Well, at least you agree that US is only worth comparing to the third-world countries violence-wise. 
t1_duscxsb	0	*	No, but your dishonest marxist is exceptional. 
t1_durmy2u	0	*	Lol. I'd love to see links to a textbook or district lesson plans. 
t1_durg4bu	0	*	>Hard to be resisted by anyone other than adults, **considering your kids keep getting shot at**   No its not.
t1_duf856y	1	*	No, for being a moron. 
t1_dujkcwq	0	*	You are in dreamland but I like the enthusiasm, i bet you 5,000 bitcoins...pretend bitcoins. 
t1_dtylh18	0	*	Yeah, insane might be a generalization. Paranoid schizophrenic is far more accurate.
t1_dtgcdf9	0	*	>Hahahaha  So they pled not-guilty and are facing 15 years in prison now if they are guilty, and you say there is evidence, it's just so classified no one knows what it is?
t1_dt2tr4v	0	*	I dont consider you an expert on drug economics either so that doesnt make you all of a sudden right about everything. 
t1_dt3fulr	1	*	In many towns in Mexico it's the only opportunity that will give you enough money to buy food
t1_dt2dpvd	0	*	And opposing them means certain death. They still use terror as a means to a goal. 
t1_dui6sno	1	*	why is 40% more fair than 20% or 50% or 70%?
t1_duiabai	0	*	If something can't go on forever, it won't. I don't see any plausible catastrophe here, just some struggles over wealth redistribution. 
t1_dui7kyj	0	*	Uh oh, looks like someone assumed that Labour is liquid.
t1_dujoajn	1	*	Haha that's great
t1_dui2do4	0	*	My point is if they have there way we wont even be playing the game anymore. Automation and AI are the next atomic bomb, and its aimed at the common person right now. 
t1_dui82ds	0	*	No no no. I knew perfectly well that it was a ron the man swanson qoute.   but seriously though...the little shitheads.
t1_duie4ve	0	*	You say as you scroll through reddit.
t1_dui48x4	0	*	Actually, you're the one repeating yourself with no substance.
t1_duibz3m	1	*	Rather high churn rate.    No shortage of applicants though.  Life is always better there than elsewhere 
t1_dujcm37	1	*	That is an excellent post, thank you for the food for thought. 
t1_duhzg7d	0	*	Not that guy but software engineering has the exact same effect on a person. Imagine all that. Now swap the whole thing out every six months. 
t1_dui47j7	0	*	Jesus you are boring. 
t1_dui49bx	0	*	Good paying jobs are just an ssh away. 
t1_dui8alt	0	*	While simultaneously and steadily lowering the top earner's tax requirements. Squeezing more blood from the middle class stone if you will.
t1_duigwjg	1	*	Did I say inflation? I hope you're joking. Maybe have a read on wikipedia before you say anything else. 
t1_dui5q44	0	*	I mean I'm not a history professor or anything but I like to think I have a decent enough understanding of history in the last 200 years. Tell me where I'm wrong.
t1_dujn1gz	1	*	I am a agnostic muslim born immigrant   So probably just as much of a minority
t1_duiios9	0	*	The only one acting like some kind of an expert is you lol And everything you've said so far is wrong. Get a grip

t1_duhz38h	1	*	You're saying my account is fake? lol
t1_dui6fhi	0	*	That's the other compensation outside of wages no? That's the only compensation outside of income I get.
t1_duiqunk	1	*	Or you could better yourself by getting a higher paid job, starting your own business, getting yourself some education, why not?
t1_duie1q5	1	*	I've always been amused at the idea of a Darth Happy Gilmore.
t1_dui6ghs	0	*	It does if you are spending more than what it coming in.  Our schools need to teach basic economics. 
t1_du0m42e	0	*	You didn't call anyone out. You need to learn English.
t1_dtt4m56	1	*	I was refuting your first sentence as a standalone. But upon rereading your second sentence I now see you meant the discussion here on Reddit.
t1_dttiql6	0	*	They live in occupied territories, often under Israeli martial law, so citizenship is hardly a valid excuse. People ruled by the Israeli government not having a say in how it is run is not democratic.
t1_dttnwnj	0	*	Uhh we have like 20 parties and 2 main ones.
t1_dspvoog	0	*	you sound like a sucky human being who can attribute value on different individuals. unless they have done something identifiably criminal or wrong, i would value everyone equally .   
t1_dsprnh1	0	*	I hate being nice and filtered tbh but amount of times they look for reasons to ban you when you're speaking the truth there's no choice.
t1_dujj6n3	1	*	Right?  They can't even handle the cartels, let alone the most advanced military in the world.
t1_duj7ep7	0	*	Well, there we go.   We made a national defense strategy for Canada in 10 minutes: Pancakes with bacon and maple syrup!
t1_dseqhgg	0	*	OK, I've changed my mind. You sound very rational and level-headed. I don't know why I didn't see it before...
t1_dsfa8jj	1	*	I really can't understand wanting other people to pay for it.
t1_dsgomd5	0	*	That's a meaningless statistic.
t1_dsewwbe	1	*	That's not so bad, don't care much for kindle, though. Guess I'm gonna search for them when I'm home. Should be some PDFs available, hopefully.
t1_dsfcugl	0	*	And that was the most autistic response I've seen from an adult with a modicum of self-confidence.
t1_dsfiaew	0	*	So nothing directly tied to Trump?
t1_dsxq9if	0	*	Using a US outlet, especially CNN, and pretending it represents north korea...   I've had enough fake news today. Bring some sources and evidence next time.
t1_dtx67ot	1	*	If you anticipate that while driving I believe you can act accordingly. 
t1_dtv2d72	0	*	That's a tad excessive. 
t1_dstuul8	0	*	The courage to accept it? What do you mean? What do you consider a fair deal?  Peace seemed possible under Rabin, not so much now. 
t1_dst5uov	0	*	> What are you talking about? Literal top government officials openly propose ethnic cleansing of the entire West Bank  Source?
t1_ds4l1j5	1	*	Of all of the pieces of shit, I am the biggest  - jackoffolympics, 2018
t1_dunl3tf	0	*	I get the concept, but have just never thought to do it. Like the idea of putting jam on a bagel. It just seems off. 
t1_dtszl76	0	*	Do you have a source that says wiping your ass will make your pants not have shit in them?  No?  Guess you can't prove it then.  You're an idiot and yeah, this was an entire waste of time.
t1_dttlo9q	0	*	You'd look more mature if you accepted you were wrong, but yeah, whatever. Neither you nor him had any arguments to begin with, just deflections.
t1_ds8iu5m	0	*	The scenario is implied in saying Pakistan has the advantage and that we need to play nice with them. Their hands are tied and they can do nothing to threaten us or our allies.
t1_ds7o2wi	1	*	I have better things to do that repeatedly post the same shit in the same thread over and over.  If you want reasons just read the other comments in this thread like a not lazy person.
t1_ds7ttx0	1	*	Thank you.
t1_ds7mzbv	1	*	Hairspray no longer contains chloroflourocarbons and thus can no longer contribute to ozone depletion. There aren't actually that many things that contain CFCs anymore.  
t1_ds7jwwe	0	*	Hairspray no longer contains chloroflourocarbons and thus can no longer contribute to ozone depletion. There aren't actually that many things that contain CFCs anymore.

t1_dt8qysr	1	*	Crippled? What drugs are you on? 
t1_duiyexl	1	*	Chopping off a piece of highly erogenous tissue for no medical reason without the person's conesnt?  Doesn't seem too much of a stretch to refer to it as harm.
t1_duj0wox	0	*	I noticed how you entirely failed to provide any 'enlightnening' explanations.  What an utter waste of a comment.
t1_dunyfgx	1	*	I think not hurting babies is important.   You mentioned liking what your body alteration looks like as if that's relevant, its not. 
t1_duj0e43	0	*	Circumcision DOES NOT prevent penile cancer  http://www.cirp.org/library/disease/cancer/

t1_duyr62f	0	*	Where have I claimed Germany is the moral leader of anything.
t1_duz9xjs	1	*	How long did it take to defeat Saddam's Military?  How long did it take to defeat the insurgency?  Fighting an insurgency in a foreign country is much easier than one at home.  
t1_duzdg2t	0	*	Well, there would be nothing left to govern...
t1_duymudc	0	*	Thanks for proving my point!
t1_duyt2d5	0	*	For me the thought is: They are knowingly destroying the environment for personal gain. And we need the environment to survive.  Do you think it's alright to poison the environment?
t1_dv223w4	0	*	Youre the one with the catastrophic problem, mate. The rest of the developed world is doing great.   Some attitudes have to change in the United States, and those ideas might just be in you.
t1_dv0a5cg	1	*	They are murdering hundreds of thousands of people in the street every year. Are you unaware of how many people die due to pollution and lack of basic health care?
t1_dv7640h	0	*	It hasn't spiraled out of control nor is there any indication of it doing so. The current Norwegian laws are enough. You are engaged in mass hysteria.
t1_duxo2ft	0	*	Canada. There is a strong push to extend euthanasia beyond non-terminal illnesses which I support.
t1_dv0upx5	0	*	Are you suggesting that corrupt governments or unlawful governments are an impossible notion?   History would definitely dissagree.  
t1_duyxq0e	0	*	places taken over by the governments you named previously should count double.
t1_du90zjd	0	*	lets agree to disagree. I believe rounding a few percent in both directions is perfectly fine.
t1_du9dfcr	0	*	Uhh... you do know that if you walk into a restaurant, order food, and walk out without paying that's a criminal offence, right? You'll get arrested for that.   
t1_duau6z8	0	*	And you're cherry picking 1 thing. They were for it, at face value, but I am very skeptical they actually want it to be built based on their record on every other pipeline.
t1_dsg9n77	0	*	Regular people don't get to take away the rights of others.
t1_ds9o6go	0	*	Which is based on the effect that authorities think the speech might have, not the intent of the speech, or whether the speech itself tells anyone to be violent.
t1_dtjvbjm	1	*	Bullshit.
t1_dtjs1x8	0	*	Well, seeing that Google disagrees with me I'll take down my comment (and remove my auto-upvote on said comment) but I still see a conclusion that's based on a number reaching infinity
t1_dtjukbn	0	*	Whatever that is, I've done the Googling, I've seen the proof, but I still don't like it. It's essentially reaching infinity.
t1_dstfwx5	0	*	No one is trying to manipulate your mind. It'd be like washing clean clothes.
t1_dtmtwbo	0	*	 If you took my comment literally then that was your choice to be pedantic.   
t1_dsdvf63	1	*	I see. Do these Maastricht/Lisbon Treaties automatically apply to new members? All members must be signatories?  
t1_dspp7el	1	*	And? It doesn't mean it's alright to do it to Sadiq Khan either.
t1_dsodpeg	1	*	Oh damn you called him out, then he didnt reply because his game was up.   So.   Does your guarantee come with money back or is it like for like? 
t1_dsnzy4f	1	*	This guy is evidence that, even at 40, some people have a lot of growing up to do

t1_dsoas8x	0	*	Ive been fighting the good fight on here for a while now off and on, but i appreciate the warning.
t1_dso1t5e	0	*	Trickle down certainly does nothing to stop poverty, nor does it help the economy. We've seen that time and time again. 
t1_dso3cj0	0	*	I'd say that the Liberal party in Canada is left of centre. They support free health care, human rights, abortion etc. We do have a further left-wing party, the NDP, though.
t1_dsobcsj	0	*	Check the post history. He also talks about how 9/11 was an inside job and Atlantians supposedly had indoor plumbing. Yes, Atlantis.  His grasp on evidence and reality isn't all that great in general.

t1_dsoax44	0	*	You are calling me names now.  Gee wonder what profession you are in....
t1_dsnx7x5	1	*	Precisely. Point being that any of these banning all people of x nationality arguments are nonsense, since most of time youve got to be pretty qualified to get in. It would just hurt us as a nation. 
t1_dsv713j	0	*	> The dynamic of student/teacher is irrelevant, I think.   Have you ever taken a university level humanities class before?

t1_dtevak9	0	*	That actually makes a lot of sense. Basically the whole 'let the peasants bicker between themselves' sort of thing. A truly united States would be a frightening thing for those in power I guess. 
t1_dtf17jw	0	*	Can't say, this is a subjective question.
t1_dtq4aub	0	*	So it's ok for hamas to shoot 5000 rockets in but Israel can't shoot back? Hamas loves when civilians die in Gaza so people like u can fall for it.

t1_dsy2b84	1	*	Has nothing to do with social justice, triggers are real problems for people with ptsd, minimizing it by claiming annoyances as triggers diminishes the term

t1_dv42y8o	1	*	Yes, nonexistent.

t1_dv5lxlx	1	*	Often limited by our own ways of thinking. Our current reward system focusing on monetary rewards, another made up idea the universe is not aware of, instead of.

t1_dtdwbes	0	*	Here is the deal, if you say I wont deal with people who abuse human rights but only single out Israel you might have an issue with Jews 
t1_dtfb5fa	0	*	I'm pretty sure they will as soon as there is mutual recognition. 
t1_dtee1cr	0	*	No, it's quite easy to grasp the concept. The fanaticism with which some people focus on it to the exclusion of other issues, that is more difficult to understand. 
t1_dtgp4o2	1	*	Alt what?  Im left wing Einstein.  Unlike the odious Nazi turds you support in the Israeli government and settler movement 
t1_dtech50	1	*	You are making my point but somehow are anti arab as well.  So you hate the Middle East and the area where those prophets came from?
t1_dteiuuc	0	*	I appreciate your attempt at being clever, but is there an actual point behind your question?
t1_dt39nmt	1	*	Can confirm. You are insane. And that's coming from a self-hating Jew :p
t1_dt3e906	0	*	No, but the government owns that land, and they decide who can stay on it. 
t1_dt59uld	0	*	All asylum seekers are Indonesians or lying Indonesians? Come off it. 
t1_dt3suq8	0	*	Hurting you wasnt by any means the aim of the comment. 
t1_dt3rqgd	1	*	The victims aren't targeted and you know it. Stop being silly. 
t1_dt39ryg	1	*	\>you
t1_dt3tltr	1	*	Some would say that it still is a penal colony, with the only difference being that the criminals are now in charge.
t1_dt3vpku	1	*	69 dude
t1_dt3r4ow	0	*	Odd, I've always heard it as killing people. Not sure why I interpreted extermination as killing, but you are right. 
t1_dt3pfp0	1	*	It is.
t1_dt3bu5w	0	*	Sorry but you're at best a troll and at worst a racist and an antisemite. You are obviously not looking to have a conversation, making the continuation of this exchange pointless.
t1_ds7gg62	0	*	That is, if you ascribe to the labor theory of value, which I don't, so we may be at an impasse there. 
t1_ds6fu2z	1	*	They don't control the free expression of ideas. They disallow calls for violence and fake news that are designed to destabilize the society.
t1_ds6gtgz	0	*	Well let me know when Facebook posts become a protected class.   You have issue with the Civil Rights act which established protected classes.
t1_ds6fwko	1	*	I think it's wrong that someone can go to jail just for honking at geese.  Actually, honking at geese is illegal.  (Yes we fucking know; that's why someone went to jail for it.)
t1_ds73b0t	1	*	Ok.
t1_ds7651g	0	*	is furry porn posted on YouTube with keywords like elsa?  do candy bars depict compromising situations with sexual undertones?

t1_ds6mcbc	0	*	And ISIS and Alqueda?
t1_dsistka	0	*	>It's not an endorsement of industrial/gilded age capitalism  Maybe not an endorsement, but there's a clear implication that it used to be better in the past.
t1_dsi5x08	0	*	sounds a lot like the logic used to support the mafia.  well, they do *good* for this neighborhood...  so what if they whack a few guys here and there... they helped feed that old lady!
t1_dsi62c3	0	*	So, because other people have it wose, we all should?
t1_dshmmln	0	*	Both your comments are snarky oversimplifications. Don't be indignant that your dumb comment got an equally dumb comment in reply.

t1_dtw95xp	0	*	Lulz..  Why in hell do you continue to expect me to substantiate your outlandish claim? 
t1_dtwugy8	0	*	Because it's the only way.  I wouldn't call it ruin however. I would call it change.
t1_dtws278	0	*	Yeah, Im not seeing anything of substance yet providing.  Are you really trying to argue that its uneducated to substantiate your claim??
t1_dtx0nau	0	*	He already backed out of it. He waited quite a while before deciding.
t1_dtx8893	0	*	Yes, and China should work towards population reduction to halve its own impact. Also, GDP as a metric for environmental impact... What are you smoking?
t1_dtviz5s	0	*	Thats above my knowledge
t1_dtwy5p7	0	*	You're an unapologetic communist.  There is absolutely no reason to listen to you about anything.
t1_dsb58vw	0	*	So if you remember it why would you say the US would never do it?
t1_dss2dlt	0	*	You heard him say that? This guy sounds like a, jerk.
t1_dts1n6v	0	*	Well it's not going to happen overnight. Although gradual, it has to happen at some point.

t1_dsxjv3r	0	*	RemindMe! 7 days  I look forward to seeing how you prepare your crow.
t1_dsxgphh	1	*	Oh my god, so fucking funny.  Please keep going.  I love that you think you're digging up, this is gold.
t1_dt2k818	0	*	Because if 42 people were not making enough to own entire planets and sharing them wealths then average income could rise significantly for all people on this planet.
t1_dud2s19	0	*	That's fair. I still don't think it's something to base our economy - and hence the species - on, but I guess we differ there.
t1_duvhdtv	1	*	I wouldnt mind hearing what you think about it either way, not a debate, just to try and see the argument.
t1_dtf4yup	1	*	You dont, America doesnt either which is why our cities are falling apart and all our institutions are starting to fail. Thats the point im trying to get across.
t1_dsbyvkf	0	*	That's because we're idiots who will sell to literally anyone.
t1_dscjiht	1	*	*After the first week*, it'll be human wave tactics. If it lasts a week. It's hard to keep fighting when your entire command and control infrastructure no longer exists.
t1_dsche8v	0	*	Yeah, this just pushed them into accepting certain terms they weren't too excited about before the nukings.
t1_dsc3zoz	0	*	Invading either Finland or Sweden would be declaring war against the EU wich would drag NATO and the whole world into it. It would be world war 3
t1_dsd7wc0	0	*	I'm not sure what you're trying to say. Are you on my side?
t1_dsc2c3y	0	*	Yet they are part of the EU. That would bring NATO.
t1_dscp503	0	*	I believe this started over your ignorant comment about America's involvement in Korea. We'll leave it at that.
t1_dsc9592	1	*	>Their advantage was their willingness to lose every third citizen (IIRC) rather than become Nazis.   I mean, the Nazis didn't exactly give them a choice. It was a war of extermination, after all.
t1_dsc8az7	0	*	Ik what it does and how to use it. It's stupid and does nothing but confuse.
t1_dsbtzou	1	*	There's a contraction of There and Is  Their is a possessive pronoun. 
t1_dsccffi	1	*	So, you see Sun Tzu as opposed to Clausewitz? The looney west vs. the lucid rest?  
t1_dscnx6u	0	*	I have a form of dyslexia that prevents me from noticing spelling errors or word errors ... i am sorry if this ruins your day.
t1_dsc0jxi	0	*	No, the purpose wasn't to join some territory to the state.
t1_dsc6wlh	0	*	Have you not heard of the 1939 non aggression pact ?
t1_dsc611i	0	*	And then be completily economicly blocated by the EU and the US... It wouldnt end up going that well for Russia since they arent the USSR anymore.
t1_dsc612r	0	*	Finland has a modern military too.  A modern military which has basically  been planning for a Russian invasion since the last one 
t1_dsc60de	1	*	I think they would. In the event that Russia ever became aggressive and stupid enough to attack a NATO member, it would be in the interest of all NATO members to nip that in the bud  
t1_dsc4xb1	0	*	Fight there system! 
t1_dsc5h00	1	*	Yup, don't molest the peasantry, offer them a better deal and laugh as your enemies are suddenly surrounded by overly eager peasants looking to perhaps loosen some of those shackles.
t1_dsbye6p	1	*	Go read about the Vietcong and Ho Chi Minh please
t1_dsc8ngf	0	*	> EU is too fractured and financially strapped  Russia is also financially strapped. Economically they're only on par with some of the EU's smaller members.
t1_dscruw7	1	*	If it will take another decade to be fully equipped. Putin would likely be dead or retired by them in which case their expansionist policies may be put aside.
t1_dseazur	0	*	My argument is not that the US won the war,  hence my reasoning that you must be blind or have no reading comprehension. Wars can end with two losers.
t1_dsby5ve	0	*	Oh, I thought you were referencing the Belfast Blitz! Sorry if I came across too curt. Have a good night!
t1_dsc9np2	0	*	Happens to the best of us.
t1_dsd6igh	1	*	The worst part is that it was about a poorly written ai, but they try to improve the code
t1_dsexiao	0	*	It deliberately misrepresents the site, and is wrong throughout.

t1_dsnrnbo	0	*	Jesus Christ are you ever obtuse.
t1_dsnlith	0	*	I never said Mercury has no atmosphere. I said it has a thin one. That's all. Stop comparing me to others, what I said is what I said.
t1_duzz6so	0	*	Yeah, I hope we figure it out, too. Maybe after WW3 we'll get tired of this shit. 
t1_duzzpfz	0	*	> You mean the US isn't authoritarian  No, the US is not comparable to the authoritarian regimes Tankies defend.   
t1_dv0562g	0	*	I'm showing you that the census doesn't make any further distinction for Hispanics and Latinos. I'm aware that they combine the groups. Hispanic is a vague term.
t1_dv4r9wp	0	*	You have literally done nothing but attack me. Middle easterns are considered white per the US Census. Does that trigger you?  You literally can't argue that fact so you resort to attacking me.
t1_dv01di0	1	*	Why does it matter so much to you?
t1_dv06aoe	1	*	Well last time I checked, South America was still light years ahead of Africa, same with the rest of the Americas.
t1_dv02558	0	*	Did you read the article? Firstly, who is on top? Secondly, who is being racist?   I just want to understand your understanding of the current situation. 
t1_duzxkzc	0	*	Because they live in ghettos we created and have been pushed to extremes.
t1_dv0bs5m	1	*	Like a modern Cato the Elder, but with Antwerp instead of Carthage. 
t1_duzzb8k	0	*	Completely voluntary labor in prison is very fucking far from slave labor. Holy shit you're dense.
t1_dv08ysx	0	*	Hey I never said that they should reject refugees due to them being shitty people, I'm just saying that we are in fact a pretty shitty people. And we're also not refugees anyways. 
t1_dv1i2dz	1	*	sorrynotsorry
t1_dv096ya	1	*	You have no clue what you speak of. Capitalism works throughout the globe. You spoke of white not me. You threatened me.  I will not allow it.
t1_dv093jj	1	*	The EFF has no part to play in the implementation of policy, none. They will have no say in how policy is implemented.
t1_dv02c96	1	*	The southern states are historically more racist than the northern states. Thats all
t1_duzzm0a	0	*	Worse things than advocating the killing of people just because of their skin colour? Yeah right. 
t1_dv05usm	1	*	>My argument is colonization and genocide/ethnic cleansing/whatever weasel word you want to use to down play targeted death squads armed and financed by governments... Is wrong.  Agreed. :)
t1_dv07gvf	0	*	lol go back to your containment zone
t1_dv00ejm	0	*	... yeah dude. it pretty much is. 
t1_dv02owz	1	*	Okay.

t1_dv0jkrs	0	*	Go read my replies to the other posts where I stated this info if you want the links, I cbf putting them in this comment as well.  It's not wrong, you clearly can't read.
t1_dv1jxq5	0	*	Yet with the land, these farmers legally owned it.
t1_dv0xzp4	0	*	> I'm conservative and say that Venezuela isn't socialist.  Appeal to authority. Not an argument.
t1_dv0fwho	1	*	is there a online translator for whatever language you're speaking?   Maybe a tumblrese to english translator?
t1_dv0bng0	1	*	But why might I ask, do you think he brought it up if not to illuminate a commonality with SA, and its issues?
t1_dv03vq6	0	*	I would not go that way!  Equal is not fair.  Check out Yaron Brook.
t1_dv0hft5	0	*	Yes, but in both Finland and Ireland situations, original landowners were compensated. Is compensation planned for white people owning farmlands in SA? Because from what I have read, it is not.
t1_dv0bmav	1	*	how about neither.  LOL .  Explain to me why after apartheid South Africa was ruined?
t1_duzv3wl	0	*	Oh so youre not purposely obtuse, just regular obtuse
t1_dv06vm4	0	*	You think I'm unaware of that?
t1_dv01wet	0	*	Did you not read the last half of my sentence?   >Its not my right to tell them what the can or cant do with their land/money   Where does that say the majority gets to decide who owns the land?
t1_dv01h3a	1	*	Agreed
t1_dv05irw	0	*	Prove it

t1_dt7i93v	1	*	Good job.
t1_dt7q0y1	0	*	North Korea has been saying that they want to destroy the US for the past 70 years as a show of strength, realistically they have neither the capability nor incentive to do anything close to it.
t1_dt7atza	0	*	Damn, I think you just compared Ohio to N. Korea and meant it.
t1_dt7fhxt	1	*	The South Korean President's words.
t1_dt7btqk	1	*	I think a Chinese puppet state coming in after the fall would be more likely to moderate than unify. China doesn't want a unified Korea on its border.
t1_dt8c7q0	0	*	I don't speak German. Any properly-educated person in London knows the word *schadenfreude*. Obviously you're not one of them. You are a testament to the UK's education policies, congrats.

t1_dt7f39g	1	*	Hence, bag of dicks. 
t1_dt8qoxg	1	*	I noticed. I sincerely hope (mostly for NK, but a tiny little bit for myself too) that the regime opens up and I can read those jokes like I can read the GDR jokes.
t1_dt7ntpr	1	*	As long as the joke falls on deaf ears I suppose :)  But seriously, sign language is probably how a sound monitored society would adapt lol
t1_dt7f3vj	0	*	Appreciated, but I actually have it! The pile was a you take this or I'm throwing it out kind of thing. Nonetheless, if someone else is interested, that might have saved them some dollars!
t1_dt8cpqs	0	*	You have zero proof of what you're saying and zero historical evidence of Un saying that as a pure demand.

t1_dusqinz	0	*	Thanks for coming troll. Keep giving reason for those who champion eugenics. ufe0f
t1_dus8ybb	1	*	I agree, peace is better than war. Kind of a neat fact. Life is better than death. Unfortunately people get killed over money, not morals.
t1_dusle3o	0	*	You're giving me homework when your claim has no proof. Anything claim without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.
t1_dusq409	0	*	what about the others?

t1_dt4ndcx	1	*	You completely flipped around what I just sa-- ... yeah good luck.

t1_ds3a0qj	0	*	A President made comments about grabbing pussy. Let that sink in.
t1_ds47mtw	1	*	In there eyes /r/politics is anti-trump. So is /r/logic, /r/commonsense, /r/science, and /r/basichumanrights

t1_ds3cx9x	1	*	Impeachment may turn out to be the best option for republicans as well. Remeember, they dont lose the presidency since Pence takes over, just the Tanner-in-Chief.
t1_ds3db8r	1	*	What about the nuclear rule the republicans used. Would that have any affect?
t1_ds5gnk4	0	*	Youre arguing that people statistically more likely to hijack is not statistically more likely to hijack. You are a special kind of stupid
t1_ds3eklk	0	*	So? Symbols have been used as political tools since the beginning of politics. I don't get your point really. A lot of propaganda in world war II was in the form of cartoons
t1_ds2v616	0	*	I think we're past that.
t1_ds3bfns	1	*	Right, it mentions it but it's not an accidental death. Not in the official statistics. The journalists mentioned it, but didn't dig into why they specifically said accidental in the study. 
t1_dsiznlp	0	*	Yes.  He was going to his home in an illegal settlement.  He was a war criminal.  Glad we could get that cleared up.
t1_duxsf3m	1	*	If the Bible teaches that men and women are complementarian, why does Genesis 3:16 say that your desire shall be for your husband and he shall rule over you?
t1_duy9w2i	1	*	Yes, that's probably the case in Jeddah, but not in Riyadh and other conservative parts of SA.

t1_du1sjas	0	*	That which can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence. You asserted something without evidence, so we can dismiss it.   What's next in the troll handbook?
t1_duc9u32	0	*	The information Apple gets from my phone is all over reddit???
t1_dstoyog	0	*	Actually in this case, you would've had to have a better understanding of the source code than the devs did. Combing through would have done nothing.
t1_duylxib	1	*	Unless you have a lot more access to the investigation than the public, you can't say that it's pointless or over. I don't think Mueller could say that at this point. 
t1_duygq12	0	*	> recount couldn't be done in over a third of Detroit's precincts because the vote totals didn't match the rolls   How could you possibly take what I said as agreeing with you?

t1_dud66lv	1	*	Pretty much. They also like to wank to the size of it I guess. Need to have something to be proud of.
t1_duduk3g	1	*	Which has never worked. In fact, it has only ever increased public support. 
t1_dtd3hpy	1	*	Autocorrect changed it. Maybe if we were talking about English grammar this would be relevant. So, continue to be ignorant about the relevant topic.
t1_dsqqy2l	0	*	You can carry much more things if you drive, you also don't need to pay for parking at an airport, which is ridiculously expensive.

t1_dsqw3oi	0	*	Do you seriously think that the people visiting those buildings are all doing it because they're engineers who want to understand the complexities of tall buildings?
t1_dsrelvi	1	*	Yes, because America has more fucking people than all of the individual little countries.  Make your point properly. Say America is more diverse than Europe if that's what you want to say.

t1_dv2smya	0	*	Well thanks for proving my point. You aren't ignorant, because ignorance implies the ability to learn. You're just downright stupid.
t1_dv2qysc	1	*	The real reason is that *neither party* is seriously interested in changing the voting system.  A sensible voting system would let in third-parties, and neither of them want that.

t1_ds2hhdy	0	*	>It is hard to see the countries around Israel becoming stabilised until Israel stops antagonising them and pulls out of their land.  Was not my comment.
t1_ds25w3i	1	*	Even that looks inaccurate. 
t1_dt335j4	1	*	Good on you. I feel like most people commenting on reddit do so specifically to get angry at strangers over touchy subjects. It's a weird place.
t1_dt2og2n	1	*	Same to you!
t1_dt2y3k9	0	*	Is there a part where I can learn how to downvote because Im losing an argument? You seem to have a handle on that skill.

t1_dt2so6o	1	*	So what your saying is that in order to have a valid opinion of Americans as a whole, one must be an expert on the opinions of Americans as a whole?

t1_dv500qq	0	*	At which point you need to start assigning specific actions both sides can take. I already suggested one for Hamas. Israel can remove the settlements. That's one for the other side. 
t1_dugmjpc	1	*	Yeah you're right. Like I said, I'm 23 and very thankful I am not in charge of the world's systems lol. Not yet anyway... 
t1_dugux95	1	*	It was a legit thread drift.  Also I think we were mostly mildly disparaging the co2 bottle opener.  The horrible truth is that disaster only represented one minute of the constant global death rate.

t1_du5ndop	1	*	Ah. It was my understanding they were both empires for generations together.
t1_du6yth5	1	*	Before 1847 the sterilisation would have been seen as rather odd behaviour. Protecting people from dangers they are not aware of is not meaningless.

t1_dt2sfqd	1	*	But the government had lied before about similar events, so why should they be treated as a source divinely beyond scrutiny, especially when there was a clear motive to lie?
t1_dulszh3	0	*	My point being that if a cop does something on duty as a government official, the insurance policy is tax payers money. A private physician has malpractice insurance because they are a private entity.
t1_dsaeiav	0	*	Clever.  The fact that it needs its own term and can't just be called discrimination speaks volumes.  Edit: is arguing this point literally all you do on Reddit?

t1_dtnpi48	1	*	That's a bit extreme isn't it? Claiming I'm talking about all countries because I've stated that a single law is absurd.
t1_dtmufie	1	*	soo, not ISIS.
t1_dto8jiq	1	*	Wearing a hijab is now pro feminist and feminists blatantly ignore the oppression of Muslim women all over the world. 
t1_dtnxhow	0	*	Exactly, thats why Im asking: why do people, females in this case, subjugate themselves to a sexist standard (something not unique to Islam)

t1_duofyrz	0	*	Issue with straw purchases is the ATF just doesn't prosecute people very often. 
t1_duplk1i	0	*	And why would you need any of those other guns as well?  Only reason you would need a long gun is to either hunt or self defense against a group of innocent civilians.
t1_duobyd2	0	*	Pretty sure Nazi Germany did the same thing. Gun control and confiscation under the guise of public safety. How did that turn out for their minorities? 
t1_duombo5	0	*	Point?

t1_duopiw8	0	*	The people who robbed your parents weren't looking to murder them. Had your parents been home the intruders likely would have left or never broken in to begin with.

t1_dtiggnx	0	*	I think you'd have a better time in /r/conspiracy.
t1_dtitvtc	1	*	The problem is detaining people without trial and/or torturing them. Of course it doesn't matter where it happens, but the fact that the camp is in Cuba makes it easier to get away with.
t1_dtl8am7	0	*	Whataboutism, and irrelevant.

t1_dtk7pcc	1	*	> dangerous for drivers  Well fuck that's literally my job.  
t1_dtio1r5	1	*	Wow, you truly are a special case.  By your idiotic logic US should be bound by all treaties made with the UK. After all, in your eyes independence revolutions don't matter.
t1_dtixmv6	0	*	its a strange world the pol people live in, sometimes I join and get them all worked up.  If you don't think Obama is a liar by now, there is no way anything I say will change your mind =)

t1_dtikrmq	0	*	permanently?
t1_dtitvfx	0	*	We'll start from the beginning then.  Are you claiming making posts on social media is brainwashing?

t1_dtivnmp	1	*	haha thanks ***
t1_dtm62g8	1	*	I agree, but I believe the initial post was about responsibility. I'm right there with you regarding the drug war.
t1_dtk3kaq	1	*	A vote that would look bad in an election that was guaranteed to never pass.  For the most part Democrats have the right values, they just lack a spine.
t1_dtkjbjz	0	*	Sure, sure. I don't want him dead, myself (not because he's a president, though, because those are often the bigger monsters). I just want him not in office.

t1_dtlwd7m	0	*	You've been strawmanning, and I do vote. Why do you do that?
t1_dtjx7bf	1	*	Sure, but those opinions are irrelevant without free will. If you can hold opinions you have agency, if you have agency you have free will.
t1_dtms9km	0	*	Demonize and shame were your words, she was saying she won't give money to homeless people begging for money while indulging in booze.
t1_dtj6w9h	1	*	I dont consider either good. Im just saying I can see the logic. Anyways, regardless of who you think is the most vulnerable its insane to leave beds empty when people want them. 
t1_dtjagnc	1	*	>Well, here's a crazy thought - why don't we just offer free housing instead of attaching a bunch of rules to it, and then work on the other stuff afterward?  Tax-funded crack-houses sound cool

t1_du2x6d9	0	*	I guess if you could actually respond relevantly, you would have done so by now. Oh well.  Guess you'll just have to keep dodging the fact that you were wrong with witty quips.  :(
t1_du3fwip	1	*	Do you really need to scoff at someone genuinely asking a question?  Was the question personally insulting?
t1_du3ivic	0	*	Followed by several sentences assuming that's what the comment meant.
t1_du37y5c	1	*	She's here.
t1_dt757gf	1	*	Not always. Life for poor immigrants to the US is hardly better than the same life in your own homeland.
t1_dt62552	0	*	I don't really have time to explain how Congress works for you, maybe you ought to watch C-SPAN for a while when you have a couple hours.
t1_dt69jom	0	*	Lmfao, is that your expert economic analysis, or is that what the kool aid tells you to say? 
t1_dt4y0gr	0	*	So is your reason for preferring Norway
t1_dv08t7w	0	*	We can indeed, you seem to be hopeless naive...
t1_ds57ldr	1	*	I understand your cynicism, I wasn't always in this position, I worked my way through the ranks.  It's not as cut and dry as you think it is from your perspective.
t1_dulecao	0	*	Have you ever heard a Russian praise their Strong Leader^tm? I have...
t1_dukm2tl	0	*	1/10
t1_dulko5v	1	*	Nationalism is not part of communism/Marxism, typically. In fact, theyre typically very internationalist.

t1_dsrcrm7	0	*	> according to Ottoman law (which Israel isn't allowed to change)  What the fuck?
t1_dta5p3r	1	*	Well that's because you're saying two different things. The first means you were an asshole [on a particular occasion] and the second means you're an asshole [all the time.]
t1_dta9aus	0	*	Then you should know better than anyone mental damage and illness is not something you will away
t1_dta0ykr	0	*	As you said, generally non stem studies are for people who can't cut it. 
t1_dtbj8m6	1	*	She didnt *have* to pay, but the police also didnt have to let a suspected criminal leave the country.
t1_dta4yqu	0	*	Well, that's certainly up for debate.  It's certainly better than allowing everyone to just freely spew hatespeech everywhere they go without any repercussions
t1_dta90u8	0	*	> Why do you hate the states so much?  The ignorance required to even ask this.
t1_dtamq4a	1	*	Your definition sounds like quite the overreach
t1_dtb09p3	0	*	Read my other answer. They were. At least one of the laws the broke states that. And if those are Orwellian laws, then the USA is a dictatorship...
t1_dtap5de	1	*	I havent missed your point at all. I was discussing American politics. Therefore, Im referring to the political spectrum that America talks about. 
t1_dte1abh	0	*	Go troll somewhere else you america hating bitch
t1_dtahwvc	0	*	> applied math majors  Yeah, but those are like engineering, computer science, statistics... etc.  There's not a field where you just solve equations all day. That's what computers are for.
t1_dtb7mie	1	*	completely agree with all your points. I guess at the end of the day, memorization and 'rot learning' is only useful when in college, trying to get as good grades as possible. 
t1_dtaz1li	1	*	I'd say if the poem that resulted in all of [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%B6hmermann_affair) drama is considered protected art (it is) then pretty much anything is fine.
t1_dta17ou	1	*	FACIAL!!! Nice one!!!!!
t1_dta74bx	0	*	Then don't make such claims!
t1_dta6um3	0	*	Let me guess. You get your discourse from Reddit, and used that incredibly biased sample that is insignificant as the basis behind your previous assertion.   Just dont. 
t1_dtank5s	0	*	Your law allows a broad window to remain open for the governing powers to determine what is and isn't infringing on another person's dignity. 
t1_dtb4077	1	*	Thats not a terrible idea, but i think that would be a fairly large inconvenience to prevent a relatively unlikely event.
t1_dtasrq3	1	*	Sounds like we need to change the engineering trade up then to an application that is applied instead of having hours wasted at school
t1_dtac548	0	*	I have a feeling you think it's crazy that alt right neo nazi supporters and people calling for white genocide don't face legal reprocussions.   Definetly VERY different cultures.
t1_dta3wlv	0	*	In short, people with guns enforce speech rules. Sounds like a net loss in freedom.  Is there an acceptable word list? Can I call someone a dolt? A Bitch, A racist a nazi a jerk a dork?
t1_dtaafmi	0	*	Your group is other Trumpists and your movement doesn't have a name, though some call it the alt-right.    I literally said you are not Nazis.  I don't know how else to spell this out to you.

t1_dta21u6	1	*	The rise of the 3rd Reich can be attributed to a bit more than someone's opinions about Jewish people

t1_dta17ay	0	*	Is it automatically circlejerking to criticize the liberal arts in any way?
t1_dta9zvk	1	*	Du machst hier ja nen ganz schoenes Fass auf...  There is something called DYOR - do your own research - if you are also too lazy to look this up yourself.
t1_dtcldsk	0	*	I've been nothing but pleasant to you sir lol. You so badly want to pick fights with people on the internet, but you're not getting what you want, sorry :)
t1_dtacbsq	0	*	Yeah and my original comment was 100% about name and politics, not about looks. Maybe don't reply to my comment with one completely unrelated? Just a thought.
t1_dtaewwa	0	*	And I disagree. When you walk like a duck and quack like a duck I'm going to point it out. Your implication was clear and it was pointed out immediately.
t1_dta4fjz	0	*	Because it feels wrong to use guns to arrest people that used words that hurt someone's feelings.  edit: and thank you for asking why.
t1_dtacmd0	0	*	Can you post them for me? The first result when I ran a search on YouTube shows them chanting it very clearly so I'd like to see which ones you watched and why you couldn't find one. 
t1_dtadcz5	1	*	Weird. I've never met anyone who called liberals that. Usually the go-to insult is to call liberals Stalin or something. Interesting.   It's all stupid either way, but interesting. 
t1_dta4huk	1	*	Thank you.  We are doing our best to move on.  
t1_dtdn6d1	0	*	That sounds exactly what I figured it to be like, thank you for sharing man. I hope you continue to enjoy it, hopefully my retirement plan works and I get that farm/ranch to retire in! 
t1_dtcf8by	1	*	It's just a disagreement on a law, I think most Americans here think Germany is a wonderful and great country
t1_dte1io4	1	*	Nope, do not agree. 
t1_dtarp3y	0	*	This must be a meme I haven't yet seen. Pretty sure my 2nd gf got me. 
t1_dtjij4e	1	*	There is no actual Beamtenbeleidigung law was my point.
t1_dtabva4	0	*	How dare you mention that!? I'm gonna sue you! You're not allowed to say that! No one in the entire WORLD should be allowed to mention a dark spot from American history!
t1_dtaxjyb	1	*	All over again, they just still insisted Ms. is miss, which may be true for adopted use, but it's not formally correct.
t1_dszm457	1	*	It does when you are using definitions of human rights.
t1_dszlw6n	0	*	well, you don't matter and your worthless definitions don't matter either. Ever looked at it from that perspective? that you may not be the be all and end all? Just food for thought.
t1_dszqpqc	0	*	Well I fail to see any other solution to your perceived problem of women living independent lives. 
t1_dt1qhc0	1	*	Get the daiginjo sake, Hakkaisan or Kubota if they have them. Cold is best but in this weather, atsukan is nice.
t1_dup0w7t	0	*	Yes it does matter what Pre-Islamic Arabia was because we're discussing history here and not the contemporary world and what Islam is like today, that is a whole different topic in itself.
t1_dshhwjx	0	*	The suffering of the Jewish people who are keeping an entire people in an open prison? What about the suffering of the Palestinians? You hypocrite. You are like whitewashed tombs. 
t1_dsbpxz5	1	*	lmao
t1_dv51ycn	0	*	Yes it is, look at the Schutz- suchende 2015 table.
t1_dumu1z8	0	*	You were talking crazy nonsense.  Just say I am anti-gun.  Don't pretend to have concerns over the logistical issues when you really just oppose guns.
t1_ds21ds5	0	*	Nothing in the definition said anything about the government in an official capacity or otherwise.  Wriggle wriggle wriggle.
t1_du8k5lf	0	*	>you are full of shit.  Lol. If you can say that after having read my sources, then your ability to comprehend what you read is sorely lacking, my friend.
t1_duajshy	0	*	In that quote he didn't say they had anything on Trump.
t1_ducijty	0	*	> Hillary Clinton's destruction of Libya?  Jesus Christ, this garbage. France and Britain lobbied, and lobbied HEAVILY, for the US to assist in Libya. You want someone to blame for Libya, it is them.
t1_dudhid9	1	*	This is just sad. You literally posted an example of it, but your reading comprehension is so bad that you're still in denial.
t1_duaooh4	1	*	Good where is the part where Assange claims that he has some shit on Trump?
t1_duqidx9	0	*	No, by spreading rumors about her mixed with legitimate evidence of wrongdoing. Please try to keep up.
t1_duqi9rj	0	*	Trump also has the habit of saying good morning to people in the morning, which could be offensive to those who are having a bad morning.
t1_duq7arh	1	*	Nope.
t1_durde04	0	*	We don't have anywhere in the us where guns are banned.   Besides courthouses and federal buildings 
t1_duqw6h7	0	*	I don't know what you're arguing against but keep punching buddy
t1_durqfra	0	*	Tell me. How much is Putin paying you to troll? Is it at least minimum wage?
t1_duqhqpx	0	*	Because it's relatively easy to see if someone is armed, if you know what to look for, and they could be asked to leave for being armed.
t1_duqgovt	0	*	Honestly I'd love to be wrong on this but I don't think I am.
t1_duqbfv7	0	*	Treason is infiltrating the government on behalf of a **hostile foreign government** like Russia for the purpose of destabilizing the American government from within.
t1_duqfs5m	0	*	Why... Given cause, the senate could impeach him.  If Trump goes down hard, I think that's reasonable cause given the circumstances with Garland.
t1_duqe7yi	0	*	Why destroy anything if you did nothing wrong? Do you not have any common sense in your approach to thinking?
t1_duqw969	0	*	No, I'm capable of not putting my own pre-conceived notions onto a small amount of data that if anything disproves my point.
t1_duuyle8	0	*	Why are you people always so obsessed with making someone angry?
t1_duqh883	0	*	If only Americans had a right to food instead of guns.
t1_duq7ptd	1	*	lol. sorry about that.
t1_duqcikq	0	*	I think she wouldve won had she taken a stand. I think a lot of the Bernie or bust people wouldve voted for her. 
t1_duqltbb	1	*	That's my point
t1_duqejuw	0	*	Guns are bigger and way easier to find. 
t1_duri9s4	1	*	To be honest, I'm simply not comfortable with normalizing carrying in establishments focused on serving alcohol.  The only person that should be packing is the bartender, if they feel the need to.
t1_duqlm9u	1	*	I definitely envy people with occupations that are in high demand abroad. 
t1_duqki2j	1	*	k
t1_dur327s	1	*	A comparison between one thing and another, typically for the purpose of explanation or clarification.  I don't think you know what it is.
t1_dur62w9	0	*	That's been the general rule of thumb lately, it seems. After Nixon, conservatives have been in free fall ethically.
t1_dur4hsx	1	*	This. The only socialists in Norway are literal basement dwellers that are bitter that the party they voted for didn't win.  I'm not even joking.
t1_dur4no2	0	*	Well by that standard neither is Venezuela.
t1_dur6fld	1	*	I suspect you're right, but I am attempting to be charitable.
t1_dur65gz	0	*	Have you been to Cuba?
t1_dursg9e	0	*	Lmao are you really that worried about internet points? Trolls get downvoted. Who cares
t1_dur3n9g	1	*	If the goal of trolls is to sow discontent and conflict, and you let them shore up the stereotypes you hold, then they are getting what they want.
t1_dural5r	0	*	> Chile isn't rich on valuable natural resources.  Then you know nothing about Chile. Almost all their exports is copper, and is one of the largest copper producers in the world
t1_dur6qnk	1	*	We lag in access to care not quality of care. 
t1_durb9my	0	*	That makes sense, I can hear I am american, in my head. I can't hear I am from America Lol thank you for the warning, Idaho is off the list of places to visit.
t1_dutbure	0	*	Nah you're just being insulting. That paragraph actually wasn't there when I went to the site at first. 
t1_dusbmjn	0	*	Once again, if thats the only problem you can see with the Great Leap Forward policies...
t1_dusj3zm	0	*	I guess what you are blabbering about could be relevant...if there was a US famine after the GFC. Stop, just stop. You are obviously desperate.
t1_dsfmf49	0	*	well there is this https://nintil.com/2016/05/11/the-soviet-union-food/
t1_dsg46zx	0	*	> I'm happy where I am, watching the other side burn.   Sounds like butthurt, not happiness
t1_dsb2n2z	1	*	You still offer no answers or paths towards answers just complaints, and now you are just insulting me. Good day. 
t1_dsovg0t	0	*	Monster/not a good person/greedy billionaire just trying to make people like him, take your pick friend but you're not putting any validity to your argument for him not being a good person.
t1_dsp10z4	1	*	Rockefeller was a grade a sociopath. But that hardly means that all billionaires are sociopaths. 
t1_dsozh7v	1	*	YEAH BUT HAVE YOU BOUGHT A LOTTERY TICKET!?! 
t1_dsoy3xk	0	*	I'm gonna need a source for that one
t1_dsoproi	0	*	If the cunt wants to help he should start donating to socialist political parties world wide
t1_dsprcwz	0	*	You reply to the wrong comment? Because I was laughing at the same thing you are. 
t1_dsp601j	1	*	I eat lice every time I suck my balls.
t1_dsp1ywg	0	*	And Anthony Weiner sent dick pics to a high schooler, so I guess Democrats are pedophiles? Or we could skip the anecdotes and circle jerk somewhere else. 
t1_dsp33zu	0	*	Exactly, so why dont they whip that bad boy out since there will be no repercussions?
t1_dsp2019	0	*	Youre really cashing in on that one example. 
t1_dsozf6l	0	*	The technology has existed for 70 years. Why can't they afford it?
t1_due1101	0	*	Because one doesn't have anything to do with the other.
t1_dsmbi7m	0	*	I wouldn't expect you to do anything else.    Keep your fingers stuck in your ears and keep singing 'la la la', absolutely nothing to worry about.  All is good. 
t1_dskujh0	0	*	Then I guess her failure at handling classified documents is not fact enough for you to see she's not in a position to wield so much power as the president does? 
t1_dsl5b0b	0	*	Why do you even reply if you aren't going to say anything, or do you seriously just not have anything to say? 
t1_dskvva3	1	*	Assault rifle?
t1_dskrpek	0	*	I'm not saying I support it but it would have to be something on the scale of the U.K. or Australia to have any actual effect most likely   
t1_dskwzrm	0	*	God, you're a special kind of stupid.
t1_dskqred	1	*	You're missing the point. Wars, they happen. Yes because of agendas. Does this change the fact that this war took place? No. All wars have agendas. 
t1_dsks5ya	0	*	Do you think it's wrong to generalise a whole nation of people like that?
t1_dskx5fw	1	*	I don't dispute anything you've said here. 
t1_dslfsd3	0	*	Yes as in the western hemisphere. Else what do you think it is west of?  Where do you draw the line between east and west. 
t1_dskz3gm	0	*	thanks.
t1_dsl3bd0	0	*	Your ignorance and thin-skin is not a counter argument  to reality.
t1_dskq3ix	1	*	When the bombs drop their last words will be Hah! Take that libtar-
t1_dsla9qp	1	*	It is very clearly his job. If they say they were distressed, he has to follow their line of defense. It says so multiple times in *your* source. 
t1_dsksb1u	1	*	> all the great things Trump has done.  Not going to have anything to repeal if he limits himself to only the great things
t1_dslk9ld	1	*	Hey bud, I didn't make the remark.  On the topic of lying how do you feel about when they go low we go high?
t1_dsl2w19	1	*	You are high as a fucking kite if you think either of those two hold the kind of power that the president of the USA does. Sorry. 
t1_dsku1mj	0	*	Who needs mass shootings when you have just get run over by a truck or covered in acid or arrested for comments online. Source or any of the nonsense you listed?
t1_dskrakl	0	*	When you resort to personal attacks you concede in a debate. Use logic and facts to support your argument.   Let me know if you come up with anything meaningful in the meantime. 
t1_dskjyvi	1	*	You are looking at the graphs ignoring what I said. Read the article I linked, which I did without editing it in after the fact. 
t1_dskjzs3	0	*	So it's ok to edit in an article after the fact. And your ignoring the poll that has Trump at the same approval as Obama?
t1_dskuw1r	1	*	Oh so you're one of the total morons who think that your taxes are actually going to be lower over the next 5 year period
t1_dsks82d	0	*	Do you not realize the majority of the guns in Mexico came from the US?
t1_dslllyr	1	*	Youre comparing someones photos to public text on a website? Try a better analogy if youre trying to attack me. 
t1_du8236w	1	*	They agreed to that but the right to return wasnt given which is one of the reasons the talks failed. 
t1_duaaq75	1	*	If it matters, I'd argue that it's no more a democracy than the US is, and the US is really fucking close to not being one in anything but name.
t1_du7qlvh	1	*	Nice crowd you found....
t1_du7fp75	0	*	Nope. Well before it, too. Youre wrong. 
t1_du7x33s	0	*	I specifically said Im not going to talk about the causes, and youre talking about 1967.
t1_du7ls2l	1	*	People can research for themselves, I'd rather they see the volumes of sources readily available then a few on reddit. 
t1_du7pefr	1	*	Good luck being sensible when politics and religion are involved. I agree with you though.
t1_du7ejo9	0	*	Well said sir
t1_du7ektt	1	*	I think you're missing what I'm saying. Unfortunately for me I sometimes am unable to convey my thoughts concisely so I'll leave it at that. 
t1_du7o4lr	0	*	Apparently Israelis are more justified in fearing for their lives than the Palestinians. Must be hard living as an Israeli
t1_du8i1au	0	*	I mean. On one hand, I suppose so, but on the other hand, getting people to the negotiating table wasn't exactly the goal of those bombings. Hamas doesn't want to negotiate, they want dead Jews. 
t1_du7blic	0	*	Well, thanks for this massive deflection.   Anyhow, about that evidence...

t1_du7jo6k	0	*	The war is long over. You don't get to keep anexing land after the peace terms have been signed.
t1_du7e65e	1	*	I've said this in another comment here. The difference is that prohibition of guns has worked in other places. Prohibition of drugs hasn't worked anywhere.
t1_du7icu9	1	*	Ok, that makes sense, I agree; there are way more important things for now.
t1_dsfh6n7	0	*	Absolutely, but it's usually the only person they can think of
t1_dsgde20	1	*	I think with posts on reddit, or anywhere online, you will not change the minds of the true believer opposite to you, but any one that is reading and that have not made up their mind.
t1_ds8h0jj	0	*	By the time they agree on a referendum, probably. I think the road to that specific point is the long, slow and hard part. 
t1_dt58i9b	0	*	Cute

t1_dtxt5eu	0	*	I do know.  You're mind reading.  I never said anything to defend Joyce but you think that I'm blaming his wife.  His wife is the victim.  I feel bad for her.
t1_du94at0	0	*	You asked how a sick Palestinian could go about dismantling Hamas. Im not sick nor am I a Palestinian so its really not my hill to explode on..
t1_du9sr7y	0	*	What's stopping Gazan Palestinians from crossing the land border with Egypt and getting medical aid from a country that they don't constantly fire rockets at? (Hint: it's not Israel).
t1_dui7fqy	0	*	What? This discussion is so pointless.   Why should we forbid murder? What about people who want to murder?
t1_dv5acby	1	*	Not really, just frustrated with the situation and venting online. Sorry about that.
t1_dv55hvx	0	*	Sorry I remember when the news broke it was around 200. Its really shady tho I dont think well really know the exact number of how many died. 
t1_dv5jlgs	0	*	Who said I wanted it banned? It is a garbage sub and needs to be better moderated but there is little reason to ban it. 
t1_dv596t0	0	*	What? Did you even read what I said.   Also, anyone with a brain knows hes not about news. But his viewers dont. They get their news from him.   Do you defend Rachel Maddow the same way?
t1_dv55owt	1	*	shit, I thought they were

t1_dsjxx2y	0	*	Nice try Putin. I see through you.
t1_dt4rbxf	0	*	Yawn
t1_dv3dvaa	0	*	It would be fair to ask you that question. I agreed with Hillarys proven corruption and youve gone on some long as rant about trump when I never even brought him up. 
t1_dtfzuoy	1	*	For me they were school-wide elections, with 'results based on grade', in hindsight mimicking the States.
t1_dtg0ybh	1	*	That is a fair point. Plenty of educated people don't see the point in voting.

t1_dugr109	1	*	I'm not the one who made a thread about the remarks of this diplomat. I'm just responding to them.  If you want a thread that doesn't have anything to do with them, you're in the wrong place.
t1_dukpmbp	0	*	I didnt say economy i said total arms sales. Im not reading the rest because you arent even evaluating my points. 
t1_ds8cge0	1	*	Not every accusation or brain dead bullshit declaration is real either.  How are the russians *backing* iran precisely?
t1_ds8dg5s	1	*	It should be easier to find people without wading through the sewage.
t1_ds8ht6u	1	*	The dictionary explains that allies does not require military protection.
t1_ds8demf	0	*	So if they don't have a mutual protection agreement in place where if one is attack, the other is contractually required to declare war on the attacker, they are not allies?  You need a dictionary.

t1_dspjeo3	1	*	Russians have tons of satellites in the air. I'd be amazed if they don't know where the US carrier groups are at all times. There's only 11 of the things, and a number are docked at any given time.

t1_dssnx5a	1	*	probably, either way not wasting my time on him anymore.
t1_dss9alb	1	*	Awesome! /s
t1_dss4n2v	0	*	That is just blatantly illogical. Plus you're forgetting the part where economists have proven that had Trump invested his money better he would be worth far more than he is today. 
t1_dslkavl	0	*	Read back through maybe you're alarmed by just how bad I roasted u/homer62 for spreading nonsense.  Or maybe you just respect me

t1_dsl0yw6	1	*	My point being that is more likely to happen than a Coup D'etat happening in the United States
t1_dsl7wk5	1	*	Aren't you arguing for not using vaccines in order to control population?   And how is intentionally allowing preventable death an emotional issue?

t1_dschiv7	0	*	Sure, but the fact of the matter is that there are those among the islamic community *that are in power* that wish to kill my people. i don't want them in my community
t1_dscxxj6	0	*	Learn to read buddy.  I was referring to the *fear* as rational.  Not the actions.
t1_dseh0wl	0	*	no, still doesn't make sense. someone can hate certain people without recognizing them visually. I might dislike pedophiles even if I cannot tell their problem by looking at them.
