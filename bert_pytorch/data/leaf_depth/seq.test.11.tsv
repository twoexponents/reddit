t1_du0krl4	1	*	Were you hyperventilating when you typed that? It's called hyperbole, calm down. 
t1_ds40lwy	1	*	Also, i didn't say that ping was good. Wired connections are very expensive but have very very low ping in comparison.
t1_dtvyes3	1	*	And you're just another redditor that wants to play semantics. Been there, done that. Not interested. I know what I know. Not really concerned about your opinions of such.
t1_dtvyetq	1	*	Damn right.

t1_dtwh6pe	0	*	Why not?
t1_dtvg77n	1	*	A lot of our plant agriculture goes to animal agriculture as feed so it'd still make more sense to just eat the plants directly.

t1_dtw8u76	0	*	Done for fun, sure, but I'm sure the animal dosent give a shit the reason why it was killed. The meat was still used ( or usually is the case ) so it's all the same in the end.

t1_dtvis4d	0	*	Dude you're not talking about poaching, just defending hunting. 
t1_dtw4ws1	0	*	I always just use they, while it isnt correct it doesnt sound odd enough in verbal communication to seem off
t1_dtvl2nu	1	*	I agree it is different. A lot of people would say they could never take the life of an animal themselves. 
t1_dtvgytf	1	*	Poachers in the south part of Africa is a lot closer to pirates from Somalia nothing else to do really no future and you see a bag of money walking around obviously you gonna try to grab it

t1_dunv4ie	1	*	neither sides have ever been left, their economic policies have always been centrist to right wing. the Southern Strategy was a reversal of social positions.
t1_du30wbi	0	*	People are uninformed. This shit goes back to the cold war, but there is no reason to think they've changed any.
t1_dut77ok	1	*	Its not a country. Im happy to admit  Europe as a whole as the biggest contributor, but you cant say its a country. Thats just a blatant falsehood.
t1_dtlk0xo	0	*	Never said it was more probable than me not getting a joke. Just that it is easy to see someone believing this.
t1_duwiuwq	0	*	Really? That's the best you could come up with? Even after I've provided examples?
t1_dt34z8u	1	*	Lol
t1_dt2hb85	0	*	>Arab countries asserting their influence.   XD. The majority of the world disagrees and it's the Arab country's master control pulling the strings. Cool story.
t1_dttbj53	1	*	I am afraid you have rather missed the point. So 'LOL' indeed to you.
t1_dtugxts	1	*	I will lick the queen's butthole for a month off work, holy shit.
t1_dttbvap	1	*	Damn, that's insane.  /Sweden
t1_dttbich	1	*	As the person coming to pick you up in the ambulance in the middle of the night, I think the same thing. The majority of my medical calls are for things that don't require an ambulance trip
t1_dtu4bqb	0	*	Five of the top 10 universities are American. But to be fair, four are British. As for tax, we probably pay a bit more because of the NHS but the consensus is that it's worth it.
t1_dttd8ey	0	*	Linux is free and I stream music for free. I'm a student in college so yes I use and talk about linux. Have you ever written a bash script? 
t1_dttcusw	0	*	I think it's probably the closest analog to Glasgow that the US has. Seattle would be Edinburgh. We've got the wind, rain, mountains..... does Glasgow have bridges? Because we've got like 20.
t1_dtvb0t6	1	*	New Zealand has a teacher shortage, and nurses... 
t1_dttkdfd	0	*	In the US, it's almost impossible to get any appt for preventative care within the next six months. 
t1_dttbzem	1	*	It's not even funding at this point. They are just being screwed over when it comes to supply and being part of the government means any work they do on a building is 10x higher
t1_dttd0zi	0	*	Nope

t1_dttmawg	1	*	Kids aren't free...
t1_dtto2qm	0	*	Don't visa programs bring over immigrants to live? That means they provide labour but also consumer demand. The real damage is done when you outsource work to other countries. 
t1_dttewl7	1	*	Not everywhere. I'm sure some areas still do it (it was more or less required up until the last couple decades), but I've personally never had to do it.
t1_dttlxi5	1	*	Gotta make up the costs Obamacare forced on the insurance companies *somehow*.
t1_dttdcly	1	*	If you think paying taxes is being held at gunpoint, youre more than welcome to sell off all your shit and move somewhere you wouldnt have to pay those pesky little buggers.

t1_dttdxiy	1	*	Unless you're poor of course...
t1_dttdy80	0	*	Yeah you're talking about consultants. It takes roughly 14 years post graduation to get to that stage. 
t1_dttfxh6	1	*	I think we should worry about the 10's of thousands of people dying from preventable disease before we worry about a couple of people with rare diseases.
t1_dtzfmzi	0	*	Are you seriously delusional enough to think you will never get sick or could never get injured? Learning a viable skill isn't gonna save you from a brain tumor or a drunk driver.
t1_dttksrp	1	*	Imagine having the firefighters show up and then do nothing because you haven't got insurance.
t1_dttg9kc	1	*	Ameriiicaaaaa, FUCK YEA!

t1_dttdcea	0	*	Damn, in the UK the ambulance ride is free. And then the treatment when you get to the hospital - thats free too. Did I mention the part about it being free?
t1_duucg77	0	*	lol

t1_dtedq8o	1	*	she gets different standards because she's a woman 
t1_dteahc0	0	*	Bottom paragraph - agreed. Good, we can end on that atleast.  The rest of that response - *smh* not worth my time.
t1_dtduwjp	0	*	Sorry but Trump is at his core a racist sexist man that is working against these group's freedom. Ignorance is the only answer.  Or religious brainwashing 
t1_dteg9gh	1	*	Haha I didn't even look at it that way!  Amazing really.
t1_dtduv17	0	*	I wanna say this one but I'm kinda busy at the moment so I didn't double check  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckley_v._Valeo
t1_dtemzl9	1	*	And youll be arrested for planning or insighting a crime. On the other hand you can say how awful city hall is and dont be punished. Thats the difference 
t1_dtdwp0g	1	*	Can I get some citations? 
t1_dtduuow	1	*	Yeah but it's one thing to vote like Rufus from boondocks 
t1_dte3agf	0	*	Either way, his family abandoned their homeland to go to it's greatest enemy. 
t1_dtei57q	0	*	Lol.  No.
t1_dte3m7u	0	*	I still think there should be a go fund me for us common folk to pay off politicians to do the right thing...  it's fucking stupid that this is a good option, but we gotta do what we gotta do. 
t1_dte3lgx	0	*	Again, Im talking about the USSR. Stop deflecting. 
t1_dunlpdd	0	*	One revolves around being in a room with live people asking questions and expecting genuine responses.   If you cant see the difference between that and a planned speech, idk what to tell you 
t1_dt4kthu	0	*	Then thats where we disagree 
t1_dsul0xf	1	*	And Palestinians didnt own the other 94%. Much of it(The negev) was unclaimed land.
t1_dsui1f1	0	*	So if a state threatens the people of a state but not its very existence than nothing should be done?  If a country sponsored suicide attacks all across the US, than the US should ignore it?
t1_dsy4s4f	0	*	I have no idea what you're taking about.   You can't seem to form a coherent argument. 
t1_dv1z4wi	0	*	Unless we attack north korea.
t1_ds9ovgk	0	*	oh i agree with a one state solution, but the Israeli won't. they're afraid the Palestinians will out breed them and they don't want a democracy where they don't have the majority.
t1_ds9emom	0	*	None of what I said is angry. Sorry you take facts as anger.
t1_dsafa6f	0	*	You have to know that I'm making terrible holocaust jokes... I mean.. You gotta. You can't tell me you did Nazi them.
t1_dsa0e43	0	*	Well, he didn't. Because he nearly eradicated the population in areas he controlled.  Wait, why am I arguing with a NAZI?
t1_ds9xxxu	0	*	Developed Western democracies start wars all over the place so why should anybody give a fuck about those assholes? 
t1_ds9e6hv	0	*	By no one I meant in the context of the Israeli conflict, which is what the OP was referring to. 
t1_dsbjn1x	0	*	Who is we. And what country are you babbling about. If you say Libya youre a retard. 
t1_duighhi	1	*	And yet here you are. In the time you've been complaining about this you could have just answered the question. As you say, it would be rude not to.
t1_dv0max4	0	*	> Exactly that. Same one that crashes into Japan's boats  it's usually in bad taste to make fun of accidents at sea which results in deaths of sailors     
t1_dsxp3x3	0	*	And If the guy is German a gun sale is always an implied illegal activity. Different cultures and such.
t1_duquhdv	1	*	Wrong.  Semites includes other groups.  Case closed.  Also its just as rascist to make one group more exclusive than others.  And you keep on doing that for a word that is already more inclusive.
t1_dsmz3r6	0	*	Sure, but some people won't and others may just assume it's untrue because you didn't provide a link. Making a statement and providing proof is just overall more convincing and shows more confidence.
t1_dtbnut7	1	*	You responded to me mate. I've no idea why you've got it in your head I want to talk to you.
t1_dtbks9x	1	*	That's because you're very stupid.
t1_dsx17r6	0	*	No, that's utter bullshit. A layperson can at any point prove to themselves, by experimentation, any aspect of science. You can't say anything like that for religious claims.

t1_dsf6avq	0	*	oh yes, definitely low cost services damage your economy esp they pay taxes, wont stay in US past active work age and don't use social services. I love your Trump logic!

t1_dt64hij	1	*	Is bullshit 
t1_dt6r23e	1	*	Let me have some fun :)
t1_dt77unz	1	*	Do you think that randomly punching people is fighting fascism? All you violent thugs do is make them look like victims.

t1_dunjxw3	0	*	Yeah.  It's nuanced, but option A is illegal and will bring the full force of the DOJ upon you.  Option B, though, is completely ok.    xaf\\\_()_/xaf  'murica!
t1_dunv25g	0	*	China supports North Korea, do you disagree? And you ignored the sources I sent you after you begged like a dog for them. You're making up your own history so that you can remain blissfully ignorant. 
t1_dshcma6	0	*	And the answer is quite obviously no. Immigration is not and never has been a problem in the history of the United States.

t1_dsipiwj	1	*	See, I lived in Tucson for 5 years. I could heat my apartment in the winter by playing a graphics intensive game on my computer, but AC? Lack of AC could be literally life-threatening in some cases.

t1_dt7npnl	0	*	And after the normalization do you want to legalisation of relationships with pre-pubescent kids? 
t1_dtgfgqr	0	*	Why? You made a strong statement and blatantly admited lack of knowledge on the topic in the next sentence. It's a manifestation of stupidity or trolling. Literally everything you posted was wrong.

t1_duo9rtz	0	*	You said those cities were largely unaffected by the war. Aleppo was literally bombed to smithereens. Large sections of that city is nothing but rubble... 
t1_duo7a7j	1	*	He's probably including deaths from sectarian violence between iraqis. Anytime someone stubs a toe its the Americans fault!
t1_duo4rgx	0	*	this source is biased. UN source would be much better  Sanctions killed 570 000 children another 500 000 died of war and the rest will die and dying from depleted uranium. You do the math Sir

t1_dsn9rbl	0	*	That's a stupid remark. Are you actually going to try and deny the maps in that article? You really think 100% of the people in red states voted for Donnie?

t1_dsha97k	1	*	Shareblue is a top contributor on /r/politics.   you realize that they were Correct the Record before the name change right?
t1_dshbf4m	0	*	No, all you posted was that China would intervene in a war between the U.S. and North Korea.  You did not specify who would initiate.
t1_dsggko3	0	*	You don't get it. It can issue anything it wants. It has no power beside issuing statement.
t1_dsf8v6t	1	*	Sad, pathetic, and now petty too. Collect 'em all son.

t1_dtd13mi	1	*	They are the 1%. The average vegan looks fat and or unhealthily skinny and pale.
t1_dtcqcee	0	*	So the blame is on people farming the livestock, not on meat eaters. You can't blame people for wanting to eat meat.

t1_dv3ec3s	1	*	That's pretty good. Damn.
t1_dt87u6b	0	*	Maybe that's the problem that no one sees the threats of climate change until it's too late.
t1_dskjh9l	0	*	They would all have to spend massively more without us, or learn to speak Russian. 
t1_dt19vrg	1	*	Nuclear rocket engine ?
t1_dsl1ssr	0	*	Except nobody with a brain believed that nonsense...but racists did. And this isn't my racial nonsense, dude. 
t1_dsmv9cz	1	*	His father was literally a Marxist insurgent. Obama's speeches from the mid-90s clearly State his beliefs. He is as far left as they go. Don't be so uninformed
t1_dskyatd	1	*	Presidents retain their title for life.
t1_dsl4ugt	0	*	Its either because of external involvement, or because you think the people are inferior, or because of magic.  Cons pick the second, Libs pick the third and lefitsts pick the first.

t1_dsmcf05	1	*	Canadian here. Can confirm that I live in a communist dictatorship.
t1_duq2bvw	0	*	Clearly it's the will of the people if the government is repeatedly being voted in. Again, stolen lands are simply being back to their original owners.
t1_dsqxi02	1	*	/u/throwaway21343232242 just didn't know what egregious meant.  He was just being pissy because he had to look it up.
t1_du3439x	1	*	Common sense ..... no.
t1_du2tt6a	0	*	Are you slow?  There is a difference between a team, and an individual.
t1_ds7xncg	0	*	Because it wasn't the law at the time.  You can't change the law and then make the law work retroactively for such large decisions.
t1_dtcw802	0	*	>two faced as seen by reading the Quran in chronological order, Meccan vs Medinan verses.  Lol and where did you get that from? 
t1_dt9gk3m	0	*	> Compelling arguments.  More compelling than yelling youre a liar! With no followup or sources, yeah.
t1_dtskbyp	0	*	mate, if you are questioning whether the rich use advantage of loopholes that others don't then I'm don't talking to you.
t1_ds8cvb9	0	*	Yes, but again, state intervention in the marketplace is not contrary to capitalism. 
t1_ds87szz	1	*	The fact that most people don't understand what the word means, doesn't deprive it of meaning. It's not meaningless, it has a very specific meaning - however most people are ignorant of that. 
t1_ds6gc9h	0	*	absolutely. why would you want your family to become homeless? 
t1_dscqe4x	0	*	Yea ok, its not like there is a nuclear armed state bombing the shit out their neighbors or anything.

t1_dstqkrb	0	*	Oh sure!  Blame it on the cheese.  Everybody always blames it on the cheese.  What about the pasta?  Why do we always assume that the pasta is so innocent?
t1_dtqcvpv	0	*	Terrorbombing was also a major thing to undermine civilian morale. So it's absolutely not just about infrastructure.
t1_dtp5w1e	0	*	They were feeding the soldiers
t1_dtozaq0	1	*	well friggin met. 
t1_dtor2id	0	*	A-10s got shot down flying low in the last 20 years?  A-10s fire unguided rockets? In 2018?
t1_dtp3vhs	1	*	Never said he was correct. Just said not to use logic.
t1_dtope36	1	*	Fair point.
t1_dse4kjj	1	*	our disagreement on the other post is evident here.    a PoS system is more expensive to attack than a PoW system.  so your if a state actor scenario is more applicable to a PoW coin
t1_dse1qhd	1	*	Fair enough, I just think deflationary design is a poor one, there are a lot of very strong economic arguments for modest inflation, and to disregard them is shortsighted.
t1_dsdpfpl	1	*	It would be an exponential lot more since the pressure to buy 51% would hugely increase the price. 
t1_dsdwqkh	1	*	You don't need to run a full node to mine.
t1_dtmlufo	0	*	So?  He is not part of the economic team at all.  That's like saying if John McCain says something - he's speaking for all of NATO.
t1_dtmkkkd	1	*	This post wasn't bullshit. 
t1_dtmoxm0	1	*	He is absolutely relevant, since all countries in the EU have to agree to such agreements. One veto : no trade agreement.
t1_dtmxym8	0	*	Well I'm sure you can understand my skepticism. I just don't see it happening. 
t1_dtmkatl	0	*	Relax. It's cool. We all know he's a real artist of deals who never had to file for bankruptcy. :)
t1_dsgt7t3	0	*	Historically, a society generally safe for its population has been the norm. Where is your evidence that such societies are an exception?
t1_dsgsdu1	0	*	The same is true of any religion. If you followed Christianity perfectly, you would be thrown in prison in any country in the world.    The religion is not the source, it is the excuse.
t1_dsqh0y2	0	*	Right, so you think I shouldn't call stupid people stupid because of some political correctness hangup you have but you don't think people should be allowed to express faith?  Fascinating... 
t1_dt3yvq3	0	*	They were released because their cases were weak. Why are you blaming their cases on Duterte? Those cases are years old.  You seem to be putting all responsibility of fighting corruption on Duterte. 
t1_ds1pz8m	0	*	I am Iranian and my parents are still around, asshole. 
t1_dtedlrz	1	*	i am in a safe space, unlike the terrorists in afrin right now.
t1_dsc1y59	1	*	He was using it as an example of how Britain isn't doing enough to stop terrorism, the videos in question were saying the same thing. I think in this case, this counts as support.
t1_dubf82m	0	*	Ahh yes, because Africa is one giant mud hut right? /s
t1_dshu889	1	*	No victim...no crime

t1_dulrd8w	0	*	You talk to me like I'm from the US. I'm not.   Also, how are those death squads rocking? 
t1_dul647n	1	*	I started pleading with my family to get off facebook in 2012. I didn't have a clear picture of what they were going to do at the time, but I knew it was not in our best interest.

t1_dulbfti	1	*	I cross-checked his claims against your posts and it's true. You've personally set the human race back about 5 months.
t1_dv4482d	0	*	The source is a former IDF soldier, it's a widely publicized interview 
t1_dv30rn0	0	*	Not to mention, zionists would literally go into Jordan and syria, pretend to be muslims, and attack jews to convince them it was only safe in Israel
t1_dv398j1	0	*	You just dusted off riots from 1929 as your justification for supporting collective punishment of all members of a specific ethnic group...  > I didnt say that...  We can LITERALLY see what you wrote.
t1_dv3ff7e	0	*	You said Israel invaded. You still havent provided any proof.  There are very clear understandings of what constitutes an invasion.   Whiny BS like what youre saying is not even close to that.
t1_dv1h75h	0	*	Are you basing this assertion off a particular source?
t1_dv1ovs7	1	*	Much better than my Russian!
t1_dt9yw5m	0	*	Just set up a small campfire. The smoke always follows you around (because sod's law) and midges hate the smoke, so as long as you don't mind watery eyes you should be left mostly alone.

t1_dtungrh	1	*	okay Zeus, chill out.  The EU is quite great actually. 
t1_dtvtwup	0	*	Thanks, I didn't know that! I guess you just have to substitute rocket launcher with whatever weapon is illegal to own in these states too.
t1_dtvdby0	1	*	I mean hell, if someone can conceal and carry a rocket launcher, I say he's obliged to do it.
t1_dtvyh4x	0	*	Pop drinkers are absolutely dependent and will go through withdrawal if they stop drinking.
t1_dtffzr8	0	*	How don't you grasp that Hillary is a fake and horrible person and we didn't want her as president? That is what influenced this election.

t1_dtb6qm8	1	*	If thats what you want to believe go for it! 
t1_du8avh9	0	*	It was hardly without warning and appearently it wasn't the first salvo in that war. Bombing peacekeepers and assaults on Georgian villages predated any assault on the capital.
t1_dtffw23	1	*	And East Germany was ran by the Soviets. Even our boy Putin was stationed in East Berlin in his younger years. 
t1_dt8mlzm	1	*	Definitely more sadist, but I also tend to be submissive in sex, so masochism is more likely to be what I do. Sadism is definitely harder to have fun with as a sub.

t1_dud33bm	0	*	I dont really see how you consider having a place to live as throwing away money. Are utility bills and groceries also throwing away money? 
t1_dtwsksd	0	*	I love America too. Americans piss me off sometimes, but I just want to move the country forward. 
t1_dtwx2cv	1	*	Don't worry, I'm not any better than anyone else.  If I was well informed but not nuanced I'm sure I'd have run my mouth about it.
t1_dtwm93r	0	*	Curry for 3!

t1_dtwvuui	1	*	Well Christians aren't the ones bombing buses. Still, Muslims in Israel have the same rights and do hold positions as judges.
t1_dtxzqyj	1	*	thats ancaps
t1_dsqwo72	1	*	No thanks
t1_dssk8k2	0	*	Your email client and server do record when the email was opened.  You might get arrested but it'd be unlikely you'd be found guilty at trial.
t1_dsu5p74	1	*	that is where the If they are letting him do it part comes in. I.E. are they fighting against it.
t1_dtkli2q	0	*	Who said that specifically? Millions enjoy the benefits, some people take the piss and could cause pain. We don't need to throw the baby out with the bathwater? 
t1_du3ph7o	0	*	And what you think doesn't matter either. Funny how that works.
t1_dsgmml0	0	*	You're right. However, Manning is no longer serving a life sentence in military prison because of Obama.
t1_dshrjov	0	*	You don't have shit my dude. Don't be so afraid of confrontation - if you think something I said was wrong, man up. Tell me about it. Don't be scared.

t1_dsgpmo7	1	*	I wasn't exactly clear at first, you're right. I was merely criticising the pure libertarian ideology, not capitalism in general.
t1_dsjxu9h	1	*	Define significantly, cause I feel that's where you're going to get anal about this.
t1_dsgm1p0	1	*	No, that would be ridiculous! But the legal system on the other hand...

t1_dv3amf8	1	*	They very good and both are in audible if you prefer audio books. 
t1_dv2gt50	1	*	I was agreeing with you that China is benefitting. More than Russia. Russia is a sinking ship that might lash out on the way down, China is the true rival.
t1_dv2okmt	0	*	Just because it was your family doesn't change historic fact. It was a war with the British because you were a British colony at the time nothing more nothing less

t1_dss6pz6	1	*	Not OP, but I also think the term EQ is positively cringe-inducing.   For all the faults of studying IQ, at least it is a real quantity.

t1_dsl9ekr	1	*	Interesting, thank you.
t1_dsdwiuc	0	*	You mean yes the UN consistently refers to the occupation of the West Bank illegal but... - you do realise how ridiculous you sound?

t1_dsdumfk	0	*	Ya it's called integrity and consistency. Not just paying lip service to civil rights when your team needs them. You sound like the less disciplined type of person.
t1_dse2vur	1	*	Then that makes it industrial feedstock, not fuel.  And there's a much lower demand for it for such uses.
t1_dsdy4qi	0	*	This interaction? Where a fairly rigorous debate happened, and no names were called? And nobody got called a red-hat or a libtard?  What **more** could have been done?

t1_dse4w31	1	*	Good point. I suppose what I meant is there hasnt been an ecological collapse in its wake. Theres tons of biodiversity, and its some of the best farmland in the world. 
t1_ducyq0j	0	*	I'm comming from an angle that all drugs or no drugs should be legal.  Drug laws are obviously not inplace to protect people.

t1_dsu09be	1	*	That is seriously the best video explanation of Korea that I have seen so far. :)
t1_dstupjy	1	*	That video was beautiful
t1_dstv64k	1	*	In fact he was only in 37 out of 176 episodes. It feels like a lot more given the impact of his character.
t1_dsttpff	0	*	>you guys  I'm not American.  And going through your post history you're pretty anti-American
t1_dstxf8h	1	*	And release something nasty smelling in Garak's room. That'll teach him.
t1_dsu5c60	1	*	Of course he was an accomplished chemist, he invented chemistry *and* science.

t1_dstw5en	1	*	That would be a great way to have zero Koreas.
t1_dsupphk	1	*	Thanks TIL

t1_dstxmb4	1	*	Haha yep
t1_dstpv6b	1	*	Someone had to trace it
t1_dstxpq2	1	*	They didn't count when they were attacking Obama. They don't count now.
t1_dstwkgt	1	*	Yes, because all foreigners who live in an English speaking country aren't proficient at English.   Did you notice that I'm Korean from my shitty grammar? 
t1_dstucof	0	*	You just gonna go through this thread commenting the same thing over and over?  Whats with the desperate damage control, can't stand to see anything positive about Trump? 
t1_dstncc1	1	*	Your just being anecdotal. If an Italian puts a shit ton of cheese on an Italian *style* pizza, while hes in Italy, its still just a fucking pizza.
t1_dstmu3f	1	*	That's going way too far, everyone knows British food is garbage, even the British.

t1_dsu4s0z	0	*	Sure, but we're not talking politics here. It's vexillology. From a purely aesthetical standpoint, it's an ugly flag.
t1_dsu1zlq	1	*	My point is it's volatile and you don't know that. I do have further points but that covers most of it.

t1_dtn02tp	0	*	Read it and weep. Your whole fucking narrative was built on lies. You can still hate Trump, but you should be very upset with the way you've been misled by some very dirty people over the last year...
t1_dtm5z8n	1	*	Thank you for pointing out that connection then. I will check out the original.
t1_du9spfg	0	*	He pretends to be the best person . What are you even talking about. Zuma had no pretense. He just thought he was untouchable and was kind of right

t1_du9le1d	1	*	Demons souls is good but latria tower 3-2 has some glitchy shit lol. The flying enemies have no idea how to fight properly 
t1_du9iwrp	0	*	Morocco got kicked out of the AU though, for the behavior in Western Sahara. That's probably a bad example
t1_dua3bmf	0	*	You could say mass shooting then. School shooting is more specific and if you're going for accuracy you might as well do it all the way.
t1_du9pqg5	1	*	It, uh, continues in the same vein for the whole wall of dirty text.
t1_du9exju	0	*	Hope the deer like piss.
t1_dua4oxf	1	*	sure bruuuh. ppl in asia and other african countries are poor and uneducated too. dont see massive rape and murder there.
t1_du8bttm	0	*	I'm not ignoring history, just cognizant of the current political climate and the fact that only one party is currently supporting a paedophile while the other kicked out a misogynist. 
t1_du8gg42	1	*	New York Times, for instance. I assume you deny the Trump Tower meeting ever happened?
t1_duc8oga	1	*	Petty projection and name calling? Typical red hat.

t1_dtdc9wj	1	*	Agreed. It's a great summary. 
t1_dtcyt0g	0	*	Khajit has wares...
t1_dtd4zei	1	*	Funny enough the senate skews Democrat because it goes by popular vote whereas House seats get gerrymandered. 
t1_dtdlung	0	*	But .... Trump was predicted to lose and they still didn't have a majority, even with all of those degenerates voting for him 
t1_dsvn5ty	0	*	Fuck that company. The local news should be shaming them hard. 
t1_dsvmamv	0	*	It's almost like what clearly is a joke about a thoroughly mediocre movie isn't an invitation to throw a fanboy fit at someone.
t1_dsvvx7m	0	*	Something about a rave? Funny how some languages are just fun. I don't know what a bizzing craig is but I want to go there! 
t1_dsvwcf6	0	*	No, it really is. It's gotten to the point where most comment sections are chock full of pre-shitting on Musk fanboys, with no actual fanboys in sight.
t1_dsvaa2u	1	*	Not a single person here is speaking that specifically. The comment I replied to simply stated that technology is a requirement to perform math. That is not the case.
t1_dsw3qqr	1	*	I have people bemoan me for preferring pretty games. But the graphics are so compelling... why wouldn't I?
t1_dsvqigg	1	*	It's pretty easy to understand what I mean though. There hasn't been a time where the progression of technology has been so extreme in such a short amount of time

t1_ds85zy3	0	*	I think Italy would like a word with you on the Master of food comment... 
t1_ds9wapg	0	*	Maybe you should look at all the history after that point?  Why is it that Americans seem to be the worst at US history?

t1_ds8aksk	1	*	Yeah, it was borderline whoosh but also a detail that some might appreciate.  Just glad to be on the team.
t1_ds7zcbt	0	*	Some will, but there is a part of russian Internet currently calling those athletes traitors for still going to Olympics.
t1_ds8bodh	1	*	Wonder if people would care if we got an influx of Eritrean refugees
t1_ds824vn	1	*	Sometimes reason does not work with a crazy toddler like Kim Jon.  Now we have our own crazy toddler at in this instance it seems to be working.

t1_ds7wf3d	1	*	A lot of refugees are simply walking across and they get shit for free.
t1_dsg4clm	0	*	The mental hoops you've got to jump to to come to this conclusion is astounding.   You could catch this guy in bed with your wife and you'd find some way to explain it away.

t1_dsgdfv7	1	*	I bet this same person went apeshit about Hillary too.
t1_dsga4zd	0	*	No one's saying the group was honest, just that the charges aren't related to campaign collusion between Trump and Russia. Only one is. 
t1_dsgvpt3	1	*	Absolutely. I didn't mean to criticize harshly or imply you were downplaying the bad parts. Do you read George Orwell?  *1984* is the gift that keeps on giving in so many ways.
t1_dsg3906	0	*	I know she did, I'm just pointing out that some far left people think the democrats and Republicans aren't all that different. It definitely shows on Facebook for me at least 
t1_dsg2041	1	*	They coddles Bernie supporters and gave them a bunch of concessions.   Unfortunately that never reached inside most of their echo chambers. 
t1_dtk1z9y	0	*	You seem to be missing the point, which is pretty funny in an ironic kind of way 
t1_dshf45c	0	*	It would be the straw that broke the camel's back as far as international sanctions go.

t1_dtqfdrd	1	*	Yeah I put actual effort into that one
t1_dttp7yn	1	*	I like that you think making flat out wrong statements can be saved by the excuse of unspecificity. I'm not offended by some retarded cunt's dumb opinions just disappointed....
t1_dtqci9p	0	*	Semantics. You're saying it's over because you think the obstacles are too hard to overcome.  You can soften the language all you want, it doesn't change what you are: a coward.
t1_dtqn0so	1	*	I just checked and about a year ago, they cut it to about $11. I think they're working on how to grow fat with it so that it has a more natural taste and texture.

t1_duuzb76	1	*	Yeah its a clusterfuck over there. I was a bit confused since I was talking about Rush Limbaughs views though.

t1_ds1c8nu	1	*	Oof. I'm not shocked, but here's to yet another reason to do away with traditional banking...

t1_dt8n472	0	*	and the rest of the world will dislike the USA more, each time they take such action.
t1_dt8q5k0	1	*	With NK its probably less of a cant and more of a dont see a reason.   The world could absolutely sanction the shit out of NK.   The thing is, there are a few parties who dont want to.

t1_dttoj51	1	*	So your argument is that illegal speech is illegal? Ok. How does that apply to what i said?

t1_dtsr7oc	1	*	Agree with you in that it's massively overused today.

t1_dtn0fj7	0	*	Again, you're just rephrasing your last post without providing any proof.  I'll ask again, what's your proof that it's how you say it is, and not the other way around?
t1_duluts1	0	*	The notion of defending your people in other nations makes no sense? Why are people in other countries so desperate to save Sweden from Islam then?

t1_dtopljo	0	*	That's the opposite of my impression of southern Germany/Austria. People just don't shut up :D
t1_dtop1bw	0	*	Yeah, cant say Id see where that would apply.
t1_dtovt6r	0	*	Plus, that logo kinda looks like something a Nazi officer would have lmao.
t1_dtoom77	0	*	Which is ironic since they're usually the most fall-in-line people and love to blow the military, police, and the conservative nature of keeping the status quo
t1_dtonbhk	1	*	That makes much more sense. Thank you for clarifying instead of downvoting. 
t1_dtokswk	0	*	If someone came into your home without your permission you would see them as an outsider though.

t1_dtomrm0	1	*	Non xe8 che i nostri media siano eccelsi quindi per essere peggio ci vuole pure impegno.
t1_dtoy5bm	0	*	I don't think it's a wrong criticism though. Go extreme enough in one side and you're definitely behaving like the extreme of the other. It's akin to the political horseshoe theory. 
t1_dtp65id	1	*	Explains everything. Scheixdf Bauern.
t1_dtooeyp	0	*	Sounds about right from someone who has close to zero knowledge on the subject  Edit: i meant me. I have zero knowledge
t1_dtozix5	0	*	Well yeah, if you dont give a shit about civilian casualties and just start burning everything to the ground that would end just about any war.

t1_dtoqsug	0	*	Ive never heard anybody defend them. 
t1_dtohnpv	0	*	Franco is considered fascist by a lot of historians. He was a military far-right totalitarian government who was supported by the nazis and very nationalistic. Not a huge stretch.
t1_dtopksu	1	*	This. 
t1_dtp0k82	0	*	Your post here contradicts the implications of your last post.
t1_dtpongc	1	*	To gravitate towards populists. In America, the left wing populist got shafted by his own party, whereas the right wing pseudo-populist won his party's nomination. 
t1_dub3oji	0	*	Variations in the placement of the urethra are one of the most common genital variations. Even among cisgender men, it can sometimes open at any point along the underside of the penis, or behind it.

t1_dtd7rjc	0	*	ah no source.
t1_dt30pgq	0	*	Strange. That doesn't match my experience of talking to Russian nationals. The vibe I get is either 'We know Russia is corrupt but what can we do' or they refuse to discuss it entirely. 
t1_dt8zd18	0	*	Yes. Why?
t1_du0mhrg	1	*	Lol what a laugh.  Thanks for repeating my original comment back to me.  >The reason they were never at risk of an invasion is China, sure.
t1_dtv7w71	1	*	Thats where youre wrong, buddy! -Trump
t1_dun6bw8	1	*	Millions of people thought the jheri curl was the hottest hairstyle ever at one point. Being numerous doesn't make you right, nor will it make any of this less embarrassing 30 years from now. :3

t1_dv38s8y	1	*	So it's not a problem because you use Apex Fallacy?
t1_dv2ky50	1	*	This isn't media driven.   It's an actual criminal investigation. 
t1_dv2xt7t	1	*	Guns aren't cheap. Anywhere from a few hundred to thousands.  I think leaving them to family/kids would be preferable to just having them destroyed? 
t1_dv2u7w5	1	*	Sounds like you need a hearty dose of promethium instead. Heretic.
t1_dv311an	1	*	No problem! We all get too heated in these conversations sometimes :)

t1_dv2vd75	0	*	We don't have villages in the south.  
t1_dv2pp3i	1	*	Re-read what they said. He's not a nut, he was telling you what wack-jobs think is a source. I understand this sort of shit makes peoples blood boil dude. It happens to the best of us.
t1_dv2rxti	0	*	No, it's absurd that Palin said so much stupid shit that people could see the SNL quote and just assume she did in fact say it.
t1_dv2gh8e	1	*	Mint oreos are the only oreos I allow in my house.
t1_dv47kr5	0	*	You can just go buy a P90, just not a full auto one.  They're sorta neat, but overall I'd say not worth the cost.  5.7 rounds are hard to come by, too.
t1_dv2gyos	0	*	Youd need to spend more than that if you want the German military to afford to practice with actual weapons and not broomsticks.
t1_dt6m12b	0	*	Didn't know the garden was earth. Anyway, who knows how long would Eve's  desire last for before Adam would end up in a long af deadbedroom...

t1_duk2d94	1	*	Hillary!
t1_dukdlyx	0	*	I don't think it's because they want America to leave them alone either, I just don't see how interfering does us any good.
t1_dujrhtx	0	*	To my knowledge, none of our press secretaries have been serial killers.
t1_dujr0rk	0	*	And whats your evidence they were copied locally?
t1_dulhk47	0	*	So why not start with this instead of acting like a smarmy jerk?  Are you really that insecure?
t1_dujxz9r	0	*	But it's a spot on description of most presidents.
t1_dujkenb	0	*	Inaction isn't going to help to improve those wages.
t1_dujudoq	1	*	True but it certainly speaks to her character.
t1_dujj14b	1	*	Money and business has been in elections for decades. Hillary had almost the entire establishment on her side.
t1_dukax3f	0	*	Rome was rich and powerful. It collapsed. So have many other rich and powerful nations and empires.
t1_dul4m19	0	*	Whatever makes you feel better. Whether she is really stupid or pretending to be stupid she is successful because she is stupid.
t1_duk0qn4	1	*	Nobody has said it more times than me...
t1_dukqhsl	1	*	No, YOU'RE missing the point. You've been missing it for hours. The discussion is about Putin and his attempts to disrupt democracy. Keep up
t1_dtk4fr1	0	*	> Female circumcision is a very different thing  No,  it's really not...
t1_dtk4ggw	1	*	brb, getting my infant a full body tattoo

t1_dtjionf	0	*	Just dont put kids in the car until they are 18! Their body their choice! That is you guys. That is what you sound like
t1_dtjxpdd	1	*	And yet you lump all FGM as the worst kind, yet don't think you're doing a disservice either.  Weird, isn't it?  And you shouldn't go around giving people papercuts.
t1_dtkdjqx	1	*	And this is exactly the problem,people are still dumb enough to find that an acceptable state of affairs. 
t1_dtjimca	0	*	Jews would say circumcision is always necessary for religious reasons.
t1_dtj83d8	1	*	Apparently sarcasm is beyond you. I've stated my opinions clearly in the 5 other comments of mine you're following. 
t1_dtjk4wx	1	*	> Compare circumcision on infant boys to removing the clitoral hood on infant girls  Or compare it to literal murder!!!  Jesus, what the fuck is wrong with your logic?

t1_dsz25bk	1	*	What's the third option again?
t1_du217au	1	*	Yes, Turkey has been facing terrorist attacks on civilians and the military by the PKK/YPG for more than 30 years now. Resulting in thousands of death and more than ten thousand wounded.
t1_du9ytev	0	*	You know we're in the thread for that report right? The one that is obviously making things up? I'm not dismissing the UNICEF or AI reports.
t1_dua124z	0	*	Nothing in the last bit verifies the statistic. So do you have anything else to add or you're just going to keep repeating yourself?
t1_duada2g	0	*	Just because something is third party does not make it invalid
t1_duyse8k	1	*	Lol
t1_dv1cbb6	0	*	This article is about neonicotinoids.  You were talking about the US.  Bayer and Syngenta are not from the US.  Those are on the list of companies from overseas that deal with neonicotinoids.

t1_dv1lrhb	1	*	So your to lazy to do so
t1_dv1kgc5	0	*	I'm sure that's what you'd like people to believe. Unfortunately for you nothing works that way. 
t1_dv1m2lt	1	*	Yeah every British group I've known has usually been intermingled with Irish people too and they all share the same banter. How are British people received when living in / visiting Ireland?
t1_dv1c6kp	1	*	... So?  That's the weakest rebuttal I've seen in a long time.  Literally whining about a definition.
t1_dv0zqoi	0	*	Thing is it was a close referendum, with the knowledge, or lack of, that we have now, with how Brexit will go, I think it is fair to say that a second referendum would produce a different result. 
t1_dv0yp6f	1	*	I think their answer will be that Scotland can go whistle for it.
t1_dv0v337	0	*	We had an empire and were great! Sigh. 
t1_dv0wyyl	0	*	That's just not true, almost all of monsanto's lawsuits (listed on their website) are people in the us, mostly indiana and missouri.  Hybrids you are right about though.
t1_dv0wjlh	0	*	It is happening.
t1_dv0xozo	0	*	Good sub.  Political discussions but very heavily moderated and citing sources for every factual claim is a rule so you can't just make broad statements without backing them up.
t1_dv0p0oe	0	*	Well... the article we are commenting on here says a ban is likely. I am no expert but I would like to believe that is true.
t1_dv1wysy	1	*	Yeah, man. Science is pretty cool when it can be used to sow apathy toward corporate corruption and abuses, not excluding when companies have a need to pay for shill PR.
t1_dunin2f	0	*	It is so completely idiotic it isn't worth responding to.
t1_dul0opf	1	*	We are all one.                 Especially tonight as I drink my fourth beer.               Molson Canadian tall boys.           Our home and naked land...

t1_du2tmgp	0	*	I have done plenty of studying on it, reading actual books from a library.  Shocking, right?
t1_dsws6qh	0	*	The first pope being Saint Peter is more of a traditional belief than confirmed history. He was *probably* a real person, but we really don't know much for certain about him.
t1_dswt58y	0	*	But the pope wasn't talking about providing people with everything they want, just shelter, food and the necessities necessary to survive to get on their feet

t1_dsmqfi3	0	*	Owned by what?  I just woke up a few hours ago. Why would I go back to sleep?  None of what you said makes sense. 
t1_dsmoj0y	1	*	No i equated phrenology, and the white man's burden with racism.  Because I actually know about history, politics and what the fuck I'm actually talking about.

t1_ds43t7w	1	*	Yeah, and Nuclear weapons unequivocally exist, so its worse.

t1_dv2jm0o	0	*	okay so 4% is far from decimated.. do you agree?
t1_dv1ondi	1	*	Everyone's job will be replaced by robots eventually right. But naw not really worried about a robot that will cost hundreds of thousands of dollars taking away my job. 
t1_dv1r9r6	1	*	That's way to literate for a trump supporter, surely. 
t1_dv28p0k	1	*	People from countries around the world seek influence in the US for business and other reasons. Is there some reason Russians are not allowed to do that? 
t1_dv1rwsp	0	*	Where do you live?
t1_dt0h3uj	1	*	Fair enough.
t1_dt0r8sr	0	*	You wrote  >imo if you disable someone forever or kill someone innocent on purpose you deserve death  That's why I picked an example where the victim is not innocent.  
t1_dug1jvi	1	*	fair enough, historic homeland is a shit argument. Even for secular zionism Jerusalem/israel made the most sense though - it had a higher jewish population by percentage than anywhere else.
t1_dug9tsa	1	*	It's not fair that a child's life should be ruined for something that is not their fault. You don't define what is fair and what isn't. It doesn't work that way. We don't have to ruin their lives.
t1_dugc1sg	1	*	Let's go!
t1_duggy5k	0	*	Lol there it is. Actually a jewish life is worth the same to me as a Palestinian life or any Islamic life or any other creed, race, or religion. Who woulda thunk? 
t1_dsuxcuq	0	*	Like the kids from the show, South Park. Always doing something crazy and wont follow any laws.
t1_duc1d2d	0	*	Alot of non Swedes use Sweden for some reason to push some alternative time line where their alt right mindset is the truth. It's weird. 
t1_dskqwdq	0	*	Except their employers still register them and pay taxes on their behalf. Try again
t1_dskoee2	1	*	Which means he was also president during Jim Crow. And let's not forget what a controversial decision the CRA was.
t1_dskmydn	1	*	Dont play obtuse. If you posit that dems flood the land with illegal voters then you back it up. source bro, otherwise youre a hoekstra spreading bullshit
t1_dskxri0	0	*	Get the votes needed? Have you met Mitch McConnell? 
t1_dskmjld	0	*	Harm worse than death? 
t1_dt20s8p	0	*	It's Ho Chi Minh city and only 18:00  It's just my English. 
t1_dtzqjok	1	*	Pretty sure we don't have that law in the UK but don't quote me on that.  I'll save u/swsfnnj 's time, - fucking brits always making everything about britain
t1_dtzkyo0	1	*	Wait til you find out the Dalai Lama is human just like everyone else, and Buddhists reasons to make meat eating ok require quite a bit of mental gymnastics. 
t1_dtzz1cx	0	*	The same way we impose our morality of not killing people. We reach consensus on what is moral or not in our society, and we uphold it using laws.
t1_dtzltmk	0	*	Making the companies richer of course. We know what purpose it serves, just don't agree with it.
t1_du14zg5	1	*	Alright, what is your problem with factory farming then? If you have no issue with killing animals for the pleasure of eating meat, which you absolutely do not need to survive
t1_dtzvqup	0	*	Just because a farm is local doesn't mean they raise animals ethically.
t1_dtzs6w0	0	*	This is ridiculous. You called me here with a username mention, you need to stop this. In fact, yes, please report this exhange so I don't have to.
t1_dtzv6hp	0	*	> There are many cultures around the world that we would be better off without  According to who? You?  What makes what you think right?
t1_dtzuac2	1	*	No, that would be the other other, aka. Stockholm.
t1_dtzx8p7	0	*	How is it relevant?
t1_dtzwstp	0	*	Fine. Their... implication that carbs are unhealthy is untrue.  Living up to your username. 
t1_dtzk3mz	1	*	^^chill
t1_dtzmeue	0	*	What is right then? 
t1_du0c8w7	1	*	Let me know what you find. I'm now in Estes in the topic
t1_du07u91	0	*	Indentured servants all around, for sure.  I don't know about all out crops going to feed those animals.  What do you think livestock eat?
t1_dtzsj34	1	*	r/shitamericanssay is close but not exactly it. 
t1_dtzrrj6	1	*	Fair enough.
t1_dtzumca	0	*	Yeah because those US laws have done so much. Most of them if caught just get a slap on the wrist.   HSBC? Valeant? VW?   US is a fucking joke.
t1_dtzmb64	1	*	A single bull can impregnate thousands of cows thanks to AI. But whatever the case: you're saying it's better to let them grow up and *then* kill them? Does that make a single bit of difference?
t1_du0pway	0	*	Then what's your point? How is an animal wanting to live supposed to deter me from eating it based on the beliefs I've stated I have? 
t1_dtzshld	0	*	Empathy is not an emotion.  Empathy: *The ability to understand and share the feelings of another.*
t1_dtzm8z3	1	*	Oh, Well....   Move along chuck, there's a weirdo out here feeding bodies to pigs.....
t1_du0ia99	0	*	Because I never said harming was something that I approved and we have to find a definition of harm in the context of farmed animals. 
t1_dt5smoq	1	*	Oh trust me. Never made that mistake again.
t1_dt4m82o	1	*	I just raise happiness by creating a theocracy. everyone love the Piety Social Policy Tree.
t1_dt3tlpo	0	*	I have told you repeatedly, you are free to believe China is incapable of inventing anything.
t1_dtgkxke	0	*	Even among scientist doing research on animals there is a scale.  Invertebrates have no protections, while mammals have the most.
t1_dtepa9h	0	*	>  both is murder  If you could choose between quickly getting shot in the head, or getting burned alive. Which one would you chose?
t1_dtnh3u7	1	*	That was a video campaign? Shoot me now.
t1_dtn9rsu	1	*	It's like putting OJ in charge of finding the real killer.
t1_dtnk0e6	1	*	Is this supposed to be a burn? 
t1_dtnzvmi	1	*	Idk why don't you go ask all those dispensaries that were still being raided and can not use US banks so they have to operate 100% in cash and risk their lives daily.
t1_dtp45bd	0	*	Jesus would fucking despise you.
t1_dtnhlhn	0	*	All those in favor say wakey, those against eggs and bakey.
t1_dtnjlci	1	*	Ok, pack it in boys, we`ve found ourselves the winner.
t1_dtn6qq7	0	*	> That was an allocation of resources   Same argument could be made here since it costs money to enforce sanctions.
t1_dtn6tnj	0	*	welcome to reddit, where you can meet anonymous morons who think global thermonuclear war doesnt irradiate to a level of concern, nevermind the collapse of civilization
t1_dtn6ut3	0	*	Half? Trump was voted into office by less than 20% of the US population. Not even 1/4 of the population voted for him.
t1_dtnm7gn	1	*	LMAO. You just proved they must've had more than the dossier to renew, you fucking tool.
t1_dtnlb8x	1	*	Based on the pedes talking points over this whole memo hullabaloo, it seems to me the issue is they think the word 'unverified' means 'made up'.
t1_dtn9082	1	*	No. 
t1_dtn5rij	1	*	I'm going to guess you're wrong! 
t1_dtncmtv	1	*	Nice
t1_dtnfqgj	1	*	Careful, that plays right into Putin's wishes.
t1_dtnhv5r	1	*	Agreed.
t1_dslbtsa	0	*	https://clas.berkeley.edu/research/immigration-economic-benefits-immigration  Do some reading. 
t1_duyn4bv	1	*	You know I was referring to state sponsored assassination.  Not random asshole assassination or you can list almost any nation on earth as a radical shithole. 
t1_du3vq43	1	*	And are you more mortal than Socrates?
t1_du5511i	1	*	Depends what he wants his ruling name to be. 
t1_du3sx66	1	*	No, you're immortal as far as the evidence goes.  You haven't died yet, after all. Uninterrupted streak of living.
t1_du46rtw	1	*	Huh... That sounds oddly familiar. What fight your enemies when you can have them fight each other?
t1_du3d3kj	1	*	Mate. Go to bed. You dont understand the answers given to you. 
t1_du45v27	0	*	[...than they.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16hyRMWO280)  
t1_dv3c4oa	0	*	Part of the issue is likely cultural. Another part of the issue is that black people as a whole tend to be somewhat disadvantaged by the system from birth. 
t1_dtb0cd8	1	*	This is true!
t1_dtb13rm	1	*	Aww come off it, plenty of the laws of Christianity are down right barbaric or ignored anyway. What basis on reality does it even have? The guy doesn't like shoplifting cunts so good for him.
t1_dtb3y2u	1	*	I am black and I know you are attacking me because you are racist. Had enough of you nazis
t1_dtb30xu	0	*	I checked the source of his tag, apparently he wasn't really associated with /r/Shoplifting, but he was encouraging them in /r/AskReddit at some point.
t1_dtb2deh	1	*	Dosvidanya
t1_dtbe3va	0	*	Spoon is pretty generous, LD50 of Po^210 is about one microgram.
t1_dtaw1a1	0	*	C-C-C-COMBO BREAKER!
t1_dtayrbb	0	*	Self inserting yourself into your political erotic fanfic? Jeez
t1_dtb1tvy	0	*	The dude wasn't trying to argue his points anyway. He sees someone that encourages stealing and he called him out. I doubt ad hominem applies here since it's his intent.
t1_dtbuxg7	1	*	Well debunk it then, the people on that list are dead and connected to the Clinton mob as described. Prove me wrong
t1_dtb9vyk	1	*	His subjective reality changes with every sentence.
t1_dtazd2c	1	*	Why are y'all describing my boyfriend?
t1_dtax8rz	1	*	Deuce
t1_dtb2r8m	1	*	I forgot that if you want to quote someone you can also highlight some text (on PC) and then hit reply and it will automagically ctr-c ctr-v the text for you and add the >. 
t1_dsq448p	1	*	Entirely different? Subtly different maybe, but take a look at any modern trade deal and youll see mercantilism is alive and well.  Apologists never do well in debates...
t1_duvij1i	0	*	I don't see your point, Humanity will go on with or without climate regulation, Which I will always vote against, but see you at the polls, 
t1_duxtltz	0	*	Typical that you couldnt address any of the points in the argument and just have to continuously vomit out fallacies.  SAD!
t1_dt7yp7s	1	*	Would that make me a vibrator?
t1_dt82wly	0	*	So sarcasm = joke?    You can't be sarcastic without it being a joke?
t1_dtaz7x5	1	*	I'm well aware. Thanks though.
t1_dtaftw1	0	*	lol, yeah we've done internal audits that we will not disclose, trust us, all of the poo is there.
t1_dte395z	0	*	I'm not sure, you would have to abandon it first.
t1_dszf4hy	1	*	The most post-developed country.
t1_dsz0ura	0	*	Again = i said i simplified things alot. But yes, obviously if a doctor is killing people, he should go to jail. And ur underestimating how important reputation can be. 
t1_dsz2dkv	0	*	An important characteristic: many buyers and many sellers.  Any one player having market power, distorts the market.  Most of our markets are characterized by few sellers AKA big business.  
t1_dsztb99	1	*	I think that it's not a good reason to maintain it. 
t1_dszavdp	1	*	Good point.
t1_dt00lv0	0	*	So if it's not in the constitution then it's not important? Again, why should **I** care if you got in a situation where you needed Police or fire fighters? Fuck you I got mine, right?
t1_dsyzgm5	0	*	Nice argument. I like how you think insulting a person gave you extra points. This is probably why you live in a 2nd world country.
t1_dszpd25	1	*	U0001f602U0001f602U0001f602
t1_dsz6uek	0	*	But it's not the cause of the current state of the healthcare system
t1_dsz29k6	0	*	And there's the hyperbole I was talking about! Thanks for being a jackass!
t1_dszf97c	1	*	100%
t1_dsz3xbj	1	*	Well thankfully that doesn't seem to be the will of the majority. Whew. I'm relieved.
t1_dsznf61	0	*	Dude are you purposely missing the point or can you seriously not grasp it?
t1_dszgyrt	0	*	Sorta like the people who throw around the phrase universal healthcare  and think it means free healthcare for all with no implications. 
t1_dsz4ecp	1	*	Thats when ordering upcomming top models directly from Ferrari... Anyone with money could buy one second hand from a super car dealership. For a considerably higher price.
t1_dt11x4f	1	*	And this is why we can't have nice things. People argue against shit even when they have no clue what they're talking about. Facts get lost in the noise. 
t1_dszcmly	0	*	> Stop deluding yourself and just accept it.  Nah I'll keep voting against. Don't try to force your beliefs on me, cunt.
t1_dszkcpn	0	*	Re-read my statement. Then tell me what you think my point is. Because I guarantee what you think my point was and what it actually was are two different things.
t1_dtr3ub8	0	*	I think it's fine to argue that the process is making less come, but they're still coming over in droves to learn at Western universities.   http://www.bbc.com/news/business-32969291
t1_dtraww9	1	*	Hey man, I wish you all the best of luck in driving those manchurian candidates into the sea, from one citizen of the Commonwealth to another.
t1_dsrrbve	1	*	That's all well and good but something as big as this shouldn't have been allowed to happen without a more representative amount of voters or a significant majority in favour.
t1_dsrscgh	1	*	Most of the EU rules and a reduced fee, Norway has to pay 140 Euro per Capita.  https://fullfact.org/europe/norway-eu-payments/
t1_dss4trx	1	*	Had to read that 5 times. Thanks. 
t1_dtscfz0	0	*	Depends on the type of cancer, and hell certainly need one after he recovers, and having the certainty of a job being there for you helps mentally as well.
t1_dttic7v	0	*	> I was terrified  OMG, are you okay now?  Did you get counseling?  
t1_dtu1m7a	0	*	Can't quite tell if you are being sarcastic. Googling lucky jew figurine yields quite a lot of information.
t1_duxi24w	0	*	It means the ability to garner the trust of other nations to cooperate with us in mutual endeavors.
t1_dt7uqm9	0	*	Not sure if you're just a liar or a troll...I am inclined believe the latter.
t1_dsimrlc	0	*	I love how you are so desperate to avoid answering a simple question. Stop trying to skirt around it with logical fallacy.
t1_dsi8nzn	0	*	I know I don't have bad intentions, but what I wrote above is exactly what you did try to do and segway into a debate that didn't exist.  My observation here is you seem to just want to debate.
t1_dsitk9n	0	*	Why do you think? Because Trump is one of the most hated personas around globally. And it's more or less deserved.
t1_dsjjncb	0	*	Are we in agreement?  If not, then adversarial is an appropriate description.  
t1_dsidv9a	1	*	No problem take care!
t1_dsirjb7	1	*	Thanks 
t1_dsiuojh	1	*	Gave you your examples
t1_dsit8r7	0	*	Inside the mind of an insane person. Insightful. Who else talks about how they are like, really smart?  Hmm
t1_dssaoab	1	*	K bye bye. NEXT
t1_dsrtt6t	0	*	Yeah a lot of eastern European's just don't know how to deal with the fall of communism and look to Russia for guidance in how they act. 
t1_dtzzjom	0	*	one government running the penisula does not mean that everyone on the peninsula will be held to the same standards.

t1_dt993cg	1	*	AND THEY WERE ALL FRIENDS AND NOTHING BAD HAPPENED IS WHAT YOU MEAN 
t1_dt8xpcu	0	*	That makes the Quran-burning law seem even more ludicrous, honestly
t1_dt8wjzk	1	*	I wish I could list ravenmaster on my resume.
t1_dt8zl59	1	*	The SR-71 wasn't even publicly acknowledged until long after they were in the field. So who knows what the fuck DARPA is up to these days.
t1_dtbeke2	0	*	Because it's helped HIM, not other people. The President is not working for himself.
t1_dt948sa	1	*	They would tear him apart within a day. And they attack in packs. As much as I cant stand they guy, I wouldnt ever wish that on him. 
t1_dt96vmi	0	*	Ah, the embarrassing not recognizing a joke
t1_dt907o3	0	*	I actually agree with that - it's like his job is to entertain rather than govern. He's like a court jester.
t1_dt8y97v	1	*	Oh Fiddlesticks, you saw through my disguise! I must now fly back to Avalon to guard the Declaration of Independence, along with the holy grail and Hitler's left nut.
t1_dt8y7vw	0	*	Youre hilariously insane 
t1_dt8vbro	0	*	Telling someone who voted to vote. Brilliant.
t1_dt8xaem	1	*	What if it seems stupid and doesn't work?  Do we simply call it Trump?
t1_dt9f2lp	1	*	Wheres the other 98? 
t1_dt8uzno	0	*	Wow ok and do you personally disagree with the and and backing?if you don't mind me asking.
t1_dt947dq	0	*	It is pretty interesting. I find it odd, though, that they'd have such a superstition. 
t1_dt8yi1j	1	*	Shhhhh. don't remind them that it's just a colony.
t1_dtb022d	1	*	maybe someone needs to suggest that to the US citizens >w>
t1_dt8yuqe	1	*	We could take bets on how long it would take before he pissed them off enough to rip his arms off
t1_dt8yq8y	1	*	So that's the only type of  racism? 
t1_dt9mttw	0	*	It makes it an informal logical fallacy. 
t1_dtb53ks	1	*	[Dropped third strike in baseball](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncaught_third_strike)
t1_dt933cl	0	*	True.  We haven't really hit rock bottom until a person is elected that has only one name.  Those long, two-word names can be confusing.
t1_dt9p4ti	1	*	So you lost your mind lol
t1_dt99d4h	0	*	Why don't you offer a citation instead of weak insults that don't contribute anything to the conversation?
t1_dt96ua6	0	*	Hey its you, you're that voice in my head. Are you real?
t1_dt9igm7	0	*	She can do whatever she wants. The only issue that would arise would be that the US would immediately go to war with the UK if she did.   Legally, The Queen can't be prosecuted for anything.
t1_dt9buj1	1	*	Well, first of all that is true of all countries. And yeah, America limits freedom of speech when the imminent safety of people in a public space is concerned. It is not the same thing.
t1_dt95ndb	1	*	GOD SAVE BRITTANIA!  *nail guns a raven to the tower*  BRITTANIA RULE THE WAVES!  *nails another raven to the tower*  GOD SAVE THE QUEEN! *nails a raven onto the Queen*
t1_du21ehq	0	*	A misleading story that paints the situation dubious does. 
t1_dtxtx3z	1	*	> Often still considered as if it were communist  Often only by children who were not alive during communist times.
t1_dtx8any	1	*	Hell even a gram of weed experience
t1_dtwzz74	0	*	Why do you keep saying you do you boo boo? It is very cringey. 
t1_dtx6pr9	0	*	Which is what I said.
t1_dty9rc9	0	*	Yeah I believe you. My point was, I trust that system. 
t1_dtx6gpz	0	*	I forget if reddit is for making voters show ID, because that's what Europeans do, or against it, because that's the Democrat party line.
t1_dtwzfld	1	*	Right, lino is a suburb area, uptown and loring park are pretty millennial so there isnt much judgement going on there
t1_dtx2hry	1	*	And I hope they do. You can personally buy election equipment right now on EBay, so I think Russia would definitely have their hands on some.
t1_dtx40sx	1	*	I assume that copyright might be an issue. The authors are probably not really interested in having the book read in Western countries, so they would veto a translation.
t1_dty23ev	0	*	There's 0 mandatory documents in the US.
t1_dtwzvv8	0	*	You're basically arguing that he walked into a Bugs Bunny  style trap where the bait was Hilary's emails .

t1_dudjdts	1	*	I can assure you this is not a bot account.
t1_ductmln	1	*	Ah I get it, so you WEREN'T trying to infer that Republicans are racists. That's just how it sounded, hence my response. That makes more sense now, sorry if I misunderstood you there.  
t1_dud8y29	0	*	No, they were called that because they're the group who claim the're going to go vote Trump because Bernie didn't get the nomination.  What, do you want us to lie and say they're a bunch of fine boys?
t1_ducrafs	0	*	Eh, ambiguity of nationality words. Russians can refer to either the Russian government, or the Russian people.  Words of ethnicity, however, don't have this sort of ambiguity.
t1_ducr2t1	0	*	The discussion claiming that Fake News isn't real?  You do know we are not having our pensions withheld to make us post insane shit like that right?  Sinclair Media? Really?
t1_dukv209	1	*	Yes they often do, and later admit their mistake. For example when they admitted that Hamas was using their buildings to launch rockets after going mad at Israel for bombing them.
t1_dud3gbx	1	*	Please accept my sincerest of apologies  
t1_ducvcvm	0	*	Poor millennials, don't even know how to communicate without an app. 
t1_ducypjm	0	*	Correct.  Whataboutism is a form of tu quoque.
t1_dud66o0	1	*	The same way OBL was arrested, twice in the chest and once in the face. Of course that won't happen in this case I would say.
t1_ducwyp7	0	*	So why should we have more right wing sources pushing bullshit narratives from a blatantly untruthful presidential administration again?
t1_dud0tio	1	*	 You replied to the wrong comment
t1_ductafp	0	*	I didn't say there was any. I was bringing up comparing communism to fascism is stupid, but that seems to be what you are going for. stupid.
t1_dt0mntf	0	*	No they don't. Less maybe 1/4 from Canada and Mexico, close to 100% of what the US drills is exported.  The rest comes from OPEC.
t1_dt2fecw	0	*	Please stop harassing me, otherwise I will be compelled to report you.
t1_dt1yb3k	1	*	Okay then :) I actually look nothing like spaghetti. I'm very proportional and I hit the gym often.
t1_dt0ralj	0	*	so have the saudis.

t1_dt0jkjn	0	*	And Fords are American or Mexican?  Hondas are Japanese or American?
t1_dt0rusd	0	*	I didn't say I didn't care, they should try to limit civilian deaths as much possible.

t1_dsbno9t	0	*	Well, you didn't. It was back under the Borgias.
t1_dsbubxi	0	*	Why the fuck do you think feeding an infant is the equivalent to jerking off? A breast is not inappropriate and it is not genitalia. Feeding a baby is drastically different than masturbating. 
t1_dsvblci	0	*	Jamaica is undeveloped? Colombia is undeveloped? That's a new one. 
t1_dswb4k5	1	*	I think the frame is missing where the cake shoots up a school every week.

t1_du9zknl	0	*	is that a specific statement or a generalism?
t1_dtprnqf	1	*	Awesome idea. I've never been to La Paz but my brother has and he absolutely loved it

t1_dtq5p3p	1	*	you are agreeing to enforcing sanctions, I agree
t1_dulyx4s	0	*	Lol there it is

t1_dumbdgj	1	*	Yes, it matters, because this is a blatantly misleading headline. It makes a situation seem terrible when in reality, it's not.
t1_duqvcib	0	*	It's a common english idiom and it does imply that X is a minority or almost non-existant - in this case non-religious terrorists.

t1_dskk44p	1	*	Yeah, I was joking. Writing off a whole country as a shithole is the words of a cunt.   France is mostly lovely from my experience.

t1_dv3dwha	1	*	I guess he needs all the promotion he can get if he keeps doing the same show over and over again
t1_dv5deb6	1	*	that's ridiculous.  no you can't.  i have no idea why anyone would think that's true.
t1_dv3a593	0	*	It was a operation that started in 2014 and during the primaries they promoted pro-Bernie material(not pro-Trump) because they were anti-Clinton. I'm not sure what is so confusing.
t1_dv3ilwg	0	*	Ha! No. Bunch of whiny, edgy iamverysmart fodder being herded by Russian bots? I don't think the Reddit admin are afraid of them. 
t1_dv3h0kc	1	*	Jeffuffuuh!
t1_dv3a42z	0	*	Yes, they have.  http://www.newsweek.com/sutherland-springs-shooter-devin-patrick-kelley-was-antifa-according-far-right-702338
t1_dv3f9fm	1	*	Never liked him. Like him even less now. 
t1_dv39bq5	0	*	Oh good grief.  Go away.
t1_dv3c9u8	0	*	That's effectively punishing them for not saying that they didn't though.  Legally it's the same thing.
t1_dv38ojy	0	*	Thanks man. Have a great day!
t1_dv422gp	1	*	it was Ohanian pushing for it to be banned. 
t1_dt6g5py	0	*	America has a tendency to have a different definition of what constitutes international waters and what constitutes american waters. Hence the mention of the Guano act.
t1_dt5y79y	0	*	Well first of all, you do know that Lincoln never actually owned any slaves right?
t1_dt6gyh9	1	*	Not outside of their economic zones, and definitely not in contested areas. Every country in the world has man made islands, that's not the problem.
t1_dt4r5gb	1	*	Hence why the Chinese are so upset now. Makes sense. 
t1_dspuowp	0	*	Except that both sides don't make up stories, that's a Palestinian only thing, which is what I'm trying to say
t1_dsptjya	1	*	Lol? Did you really just try to claim that shooting rockets at schools is no more than warning shot? They've killed people before, what the hell do you mean they aren't a threat?
t1_dsq1z0i	0	*	No, you're biased because you agree with him because your views align with his, in contrast to reality. 
t1_dt094ef	0	*	>Well, immigrants do cause a lot more crime. Logically, more immigrants would mean more crime, no?  And you call me a troll, hah!
t1_dtv0p8d	1	*	It was super late last night when I was in this thread. I looked it up this morning and now I know better!
t1_duintg0	0	*	And they are not.
t1_dv4iq52	1	*	So what do you think we should do to combat climate change?
t1_due6r15	0	*	How exactly will unemployed people be a waste on the system? Surely nowadays it would, but also consider how the system will change in time.
t1_dseltc7	0	*	You just presented specific evidence...against your argument. 
t1_dsfci32	1	*	Thank you, I didnt know this about Mohave society.
t1_dsexfgh	1	*	If its the one you're suggesting - the wrong conclusion. 
t1_dsevroe	1	*	That these 10 allegations should be looked at and not assume that all are fine with sexual assault.
t1_dsewf26	1	*	I would never use loosely related anecdotes to show anything systematic. There might be individual cases of racism or sexism but not systematic.
t1_dsf2wsq	0	*	So you want to tell me that all these white men in google self discriminate on a daily basis and are suffering in silence except two guys who got fired?
t1_dsxgw6t	1	*	Yeah, sure. /s
t1_dsxrx3x	0	*	No it's not. There were armed guards at every voting place, it's well documented.  Another thing that is well-documented is that massive voting-fraud was happening.
t1_dtreflg	0	*	Oh, I'm aware; I live here. It's absurd right now.
t1_dtrtdoy	0	*	Is it hard to say that I don't care about someone's baby pictures?
t1_dtriezn	0	*	Congrats on the penis
t1_dtrusyr	0	*	Thank you for your answer! I think the main reason I don't sign up is because of the user interface. I still have trouble figuring out how to read tweets in a thread. Thank you again
t1_dtrj7hv	0	*	Yeah I suppose so. Personally I think it's also lame having your boss and co-workers as friends too
t1_dtrnjv5	0	*	How does one become a doctor when they're born with a disability and have no way of paying for college?
t1_dtrkqqg	1	*	how am i supposed to quickly find that song from 10+ years ago though?
t1_dtrd1bz	1	*	Oldest of gen Y checking in, same transition bullshit, I remember playing EQ on dialup and when Yahoo was the end all be all of search functionality.
t1_dtrip8u	0	*	Yeah its a single area because thats the area were talking about.
t1_dtrlzua	1	*	I do that, especially after my kid borrows my phone and I have Markiplier, Jacksepticeye, and One-Man Hide and Seek as my only suggestions for days. 
t1_dtsd9fd	0	*	Look at all of you with 16GB of RAM. I need to switch from 8 as well. 
t1_dtrhhpc	1	*	It's halfway between Walmart and Target. With even fewer cashiers.
t1_dtre1db	1	*	It is, but it's also the only part i have to use to connect with friends
t1_dtrfjmt	0	*	It was really the easiest place to go to. You could always convince someone that they needed to go to Walmart...because you can always go to Walmart. 
t1_dtrewop	1	*	nah. 
t1_dtre1br	1	*	Nice! Thanks.
t1_dtrjrhq	0	*	This is the reason I only have my sister and one of my nieces added on Facebook from my family. Everyone else? Not happening, that would ruin the platform COMPLETELY. 
t1_duht6bh	1	*	Unless, of course, they have fucked it.  FTFY 
t1_duw5w65	0	*	Lol the opposite is happening. Haredim are exploding and Muslims are slowing down.
t1_dubsa0p	0	*	TIL I am fake. I follow her on Twitter and favorite her posts pretty often.
t1_dubo8i9	1	*	> Muller is moving fast. :D  Yep. 15mo into this and nothing to show for it. Moving fast!
t1_dubpwdd	0	*	just because reddit is mostly liberal doesnt mean they supported clinton.  
t1_dubp2ta	0	*	Exactly. 
t1_dug4uuf	1	*	**What's wrong with you?** I post that entire response to your idiocy and your only response is me wanting to sacrifice children? Are you fucking kidding me? Re-read my last post and try again. 
t1_dubmx5p	0	*	Fuckin' bots man.
t1_dubupes	1	*	> implying the Queen doesn't have a Satanic altar under Buckingham Palace
t1_dtlhfiv	1	*	You're arguing from a standpoint of conviction on something that doesn't actually exist yet?  You're out of your mind
t1_dtkqppo	1	*	I'm a friendly Troll all-be-it part time, very part time lol
t1_dtlcy4q	1	*	Thats a very absolute statement about a very complex issue.
t1_dtl3sl6	0	*	Well it depends. Sure a black angus steak is a researched item at least here in italy, but i wouldn't eat US meat apart from those.
t1_dtl41a2	1	*	Whoosh
t1_dtljcu5	1	*	Phages work so well it's surprising western science hides away from it.
t1_dtlhioq	1	*	yes, but they don't give a shit.
t1_dtl1l2i	0	*	I use superglue for the crevasses I get in my fingers from stress / eczema. Works great. The pharmacies sell a 'medical' grade for like 12 bucks, 30 bucks if it's for your feet. Total rip off.
t1_dtolife	0	*	What am I supposed to eat instead? Vegetables? Vegetables taste horrible. Intensely bitter.
t1_dtl8bzt	1	*	It took me a while to transition to veganism. Some people can do it overnight but I couldn't do it. Just keep doing your best!
t1_dtl1603	1	*	Just let him keep doing it. Otherwise we'll never have those weird statistics to look at during late night phone binging. 
t1_dtmnzdr	0	*	You're straw-manning, I just said it's a brain drain, nothing else.
t1_dthov4t	1	*	Death is the greatest obstacle to freedom
t1_dthfxp0	1	*	 Kinda like how you and others automatically assume that because i disagree with you, i must be a Trump supporter eh?
t1_dthouoa	1	*	It was the Mupes.
t1_dthdc9w	0	*	You're being actively ignorant. On purpose I can't tell.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifa_(United_States)
t1_dthh19f	0	*	No, don't tell him: do your research. He already provided you with a bunch of links. Instead, why don't you tell us what you know about this guy and provide some damn sources of your own?
t1_dtheh2c	0	*	>Get off your fucking high horse this is real life and you are wrong on this.  You are literally the only person in this discussion projecting any type of superiority. 
t1_dtn2qis	0	*	No response to the wifi allergy thing? And why you used that particular example? 
t1_dthkexc	0	*	right back at ya, slick
t1_dthn749	1	*	Those are the ones.  I've given up trying to follow any of this as a logical endeavor.  
t1_dthjqd1	1	*	Right. The intelligence that the memo is based on is real. But it omits anything that doesn't support its narrative, or exculpates the people it's trying to attack, in this case Rosenstein. 
t1_dthfaos	0	*	Haha yes that is common knowledge, dipshit. Spewing Meuller facts for absolutely no reason?  
t1_dthsblm	1	*	minimize it by expanding the amount of countries we were bombing in? I guarentee Bernie would have bombed less then Obama, he didnt HAVE to do anything
t1_dthfxth	1	*	I'm not sure of your point. Fact is, if I said I had an affair with another woman, but my wife won't care so it can't be used as blackmail. That doesn't cut it.
t1_dthu5t4	0	*	I really don't care if they investigate Clinton as long as they continue to investigate Trump and co. 
t1_dthafn1	1	*	They misidentified one of the US diplomats that they claimed was in on it. They said he was in Russia at a certain time when he actually wasn't. 
t1_dthjzbs	0	*	>Posting that on every Russian article but not on other political articles is using suggestion.  No... it really isn't. You're paranoid. 
t1_dti397m	1	*	Sure but most places aren't anywhere near the way people try and describe reddit.
t1_dthshy9	1	*	It's all in your first paragraph.
t1_dthhes1	1	*	I accept your apology.  I'm sure I'm guilty of the same.
t1_dthmhfh	0	*	How the fuck did you get downvoted that much for stating a fact?! Brian Ross from ABC was just suspended a month ago for reporting nonsense.
t1_dthkjkd	1	*	The guy above you is using Conways alternative facts. He doesnt care for the truth, just to spread misinformation.
t1_dthqz8u	0	*	Im just an obama and trump voter  Im not actually jesus christ  Do you wish to engage in civil discussion?
t1_dtj91an	1	*	>We have grave concerns about material omissions of fact that fundamentally impact the memos accuracy   The FBI official statement... 
t1_dthbtxh	1	*	Perhaps mueller was bored from not finding any evidence and just hired those guys to hangout with him. 
t1_dthtwy8	1	*	Wow, really focused on the important part of my comment. It's still a large group of people
t1_dthqpyn	0	*	So you believe the poster is using a strawman?
t1_dthr76h	0	*	Nope he was looking for an issue. It didn't have to exist, just phrased close enough to reference.
t1_dssplte	0	*	How do I reach these kiiiiids?
t1_dsit4py	0	*	Thanks for proving that you have zero valid sources for any of your personal opinions that you are trying to pretend are facts.
t1_dsiltqi	1	*	Who is Regularly engaging in sexual assault?
t1_dtp6l9u	1	*	I take it you don't know what the word supremacy means in white supremacy?
t1_dsmomlr	0	*	But it had fallen out of practice as society progressed. He is responsible for bringing it back in the States.
t1_dthc460	0	*	Not the same thing at all, but I know this is an easy response for you.
t1_dtgfl7k	1	*	lol
t1_dtglvqq	0	*	If you think the media is liberal then you are a cultist. I feel the same. The media is right wing biased. Roger Ailes. Rupert Murdock. The facts in front of you, open your eyes and look at them.
t1_dtgn0h0	1	*	Why not all of them?
t1_dtholr7	1	*	The problem is that over half of the country either doesn't give a shit or is in support of this.
t1_dtgqkkm	0	*	This.  The .01% want us too poor, sick, scared to rise up and shake the walls of power.
t1_dtgivn1	0	*	Brave new world indeed. We're way too distracted by our daily entertainment to give it all up for potentially no change at all.
t1_dtgm8pi	1	*	Well, technically impeachment is just the bringing of charges against a high-ranking elected official. It doesnt automatically remove you from office, its only the first step in that process.
t1_dtgmyih	1	*	> turnip  Carrot 
t1_dtgws6f	0	*	No, he's saying it isn't breaking the law because the precedent has been set that this action is not against the law and is well within the legal real of power of the president. 
t1_dtgfstb	0	*	Neither of them stepped down. Both served out the remainders of their terms as president. 
t1_dtggof8	1	*	I feel you bro  I'm still waiting on Julian to present at the Fake News Pizzagate Awards, too.
t1_dthc7gu	0	*	Nope. Not even close to the same thing. But again, a snarky one word response makes it make it easy for you to avoid reality.
t1_dtgn0sk	1	*	Hence why the rest of the world thinks your country is kinda messed up 
t1_dth5xdx	1	*	Then that's just Republicans devolving to team politics, not everyone else.

t1_dth72th	0	*	When did you stop beating your wife?
t1_dth6qz6	1	*	Kshama Sawant is a hard leftist, not Bernie.
t1_dtgn53g	1	*	They watch fox 
t1_dtynhzf	1	*	Sounds rough. They sound like they both have pretty strong opinions about it, and can't share in that part of their lives.
t1_dtyo6us	0	*	There is definitely an Obama dildo you can get
t1_dtyqcwp	1	*	Sir, your username is amazing. Thank you for brightening my day
t1_du000jm	0	*	Bro, Obama is almost as white as Conan O'Brien.
t1_dtz0i4l	1	*	Honestly giving something is way different then trying to make profit from something... Bringing business is good practice. Trying to force business is bad practice....
t1_dtyx4fh	1	*	Got it. Thanks! I didn't notice that.  That's the best gdp growth since Obama's sixth year in office. I sure hope Trump can keep it up for that long!
t1_dt5s4y0	1	*	Terminology might be wrong, but maths is still correct.
t1_dt4urk6	1	*	Would be about 70 USD in Sweden :(
t1_dtvxrad	0	*	The median income is 26k. The median household income is 56k. The average wage is 62k.   30k would be middle of the pack counting retirees and people on benefits.
t1_dtwdbu0	0	*	It's nice at Amazon till they give you an extra 12 hour day at midnight the day before (working night shift). After months of it I couldn't stand it anymore, just slept the first day anyway.
t1_dtvvkqb	1	*	Outsourced it. 
t1_dtvx884	0	*	Oh yes, please give me more, so why do you hate public servants?   Did you hate Obama because he sat behind a desk? You have no logic, just take a break while you are ahead.
t1_dtvwknq	1	*	So how can you even choose Health if your definition of it requires free time?  Your system sucks.
t1_dtw2abe	1	*	Which is fair.  But the LateStageCapitalism stuff on here is just throwing the baby out with the bathwater. 
t1_dtd7hfo	1	*	yeah that sounds about right. no, not all homeless people are theives but shelters are not a safe place.
t1_dtd6j4r	1	*	You can buy a 3 bed 3 bath in Wichita kansas for about $150k
t1_du52jhz	1	*	*faceplant into desk*
t1_dtzhsqs	1	*	Wouldn't surprise me.
t1_du052d4	0	*	Yeah we should definitely address all of those issues. Voting and secure elections should be no brainers.
t1_ds4e7hh	0	*	Why are you arguing with me? Check the theory and if you have valid points present them with some details, not soundbites, thanks.
t1_ds4568r	1	*	Ok. Now run along. 
t1_dsjtlcp	0	*	How do you know the person expected a benefit? It was an anonymous donor so they didn't even take credit. 
t1_dsej85c	1	*	wah stop insulting my pet bandaid solution to habitat destruction
t1_dseunsm	1	*	Yup, no wonder he lives bellow the poverty line
t1_dupngmj	1	*	This is why people like you have no difference from Erdogan's lovers.   All you do say is We did not do it. They did. Pathetic. 
t1_dup5zwo	0	*	What line was not civilized? I'm sorry I hurt you. That wasn't my intent! I'm all love dude, no hate. 
t1_dupcybz	0	*	Dat whataboutism tho
t1_dsfq239	0	*	So why single out Syria on your initial rant and not be critical of both Syria and Israel?
t1_ds2fc8t	0	*	So you think that if we had a purely littoral defense fleet after WW2 and hadn't exerted military and diplomatic influence across the globe that we would've been just fine during the Cold War?
t1_duht0jt	1	*	Big time. What a load of nonsense to have to put up with.
t1_duinziw	0	*	Of course. Why else would you speak in secret Chinese code?
t1_dtnh0im	1	*	Very naive. 
t1_ds6wuaj	0	*	Aye man you need to be able to change your opinion when faced with evidence that contradicts your opinion 
t1_ds85o12	1	*	What about it?  Idiots will still be idiots 
t1_du98rt2	1	*	Nu uh, .5 rounds up to 1! 
t1_dua5wj8	1	*	Depends on your perspective. It's perhaps even more immoral to endanger the survival of our own species by not spreading out. At least if you ask humans. 
t1_dsphj38	1	*	That's the general sentiment. 
t1_dtyaz3v	1	*	Oh I see. I misunderstood. 
t1_dtynhlt	1	*	So when you shoot back, just shoot back in the same general pattern and use your weapons to intercept theirs or create a large debris field.. like counter measures.
t1_dtynkp1	0	*	They can maneuver. They just cant get far enough for it to make a difference in 30min time.
t1_dtyih8k	1	*	Somewhat like a modern naval battle, but in three dimensions.
t1_dssjvkh	1	*	That quote is stupid  i'll be checking back in 2,500 years to read your.. derivative fart joke?
t1_dstiucz	1	*	>They have already said they won't be buying new debt  They said they were considering and has confirmed later that they will still buy
t1_dsfkbci	0	*	But he did say it and you are acting as an appologist for it.  See racists? They say racist shit like he did. People who are not? Don't.  Does that make sense to you?
t1_dtgrn7r	1	*	Lol. 
t1_dulop80	0	*	That doesn't mean users and the drug itself hasn't been studied.  Edit: and your imagination isn't really a good basis to make any kind of argument from
t1_dtkg2px	0	*	***dude***
t1_dtf04y0	1	*	> It's just that women aren't as psychopathic as men when it comes to pursuing billion dollar levels of power.  Source?
t1_dtf4n72	1	*	yeah I know I shouldn't be surprised every time I see it but I still am. Whenever I don't think people could be so blind they amaze me again and again.  
t1_dtgsr7d	1	*	Til the truth is that not giving women rights is actually feminism 
t1_dtf9x0z	1	*	Im pretty sure zionists jews have a much worse impact on the world than Muslims could ever dream of.

t1_dtf775w	1	*	Yeah, youll see real fights for real issues
t1_dtf3w97	0	*	Well, a side argument I was making is that they're not so much imposed on women as they are bought into by women.
t1_dtfloyi	0	*	Jesus Christ I really shouldn't have to put a /s after that, but I guess this website is dead now so I'm not really surprised.

t1_dtfm2ji	0	*	You did it. You solved sexism. Now we just need men to hand over their money to women to solve the power disparity. Good luck making that work. 
t1_dtev1ad	0	*	Completely different set of circumstances. How will Iran do it?
t1_dtfzbjq	1	*	Best argument you guys had so far. 
t1_dtf61es	0	*	Oh yeah definitely. I wasn't blaming you :)

t1_du2io67	0	*	k
t1_du45tsx	0	*	This is true. I changed my voicemail to one explaining that I screen my calls. If the person calling can't leave a message, it must not be important or they're a robot. 
t1_du29ha8	0	*	Totally possible if you consider many millenials are living with parents and working part time jobs compared to previous generations.
t1_du2b7sp	1	*	Fair enough.  You'll get no argument from me that the leadership of the party needs to be revamped.  It's been a problem for over a decade - too many old people stuck in their old ways.
t1_du2f39e	1	*	Is LN a public interest company?

t1_duwyl4c	1	*	Who should scrub any floor in a wealthy society?   Those that need wages to buy food and services.  Otherwise it's welfare labor to the rich.
t1_dux10fy	1	*	I saw your comment after I posted mine, I retract my statement
t1_du9em4t	0	*	I think Brazil is a racist country. Does that mean I'm prejudiced against myself?

t1_duabfq5	1	*	Would you support female circumsicison (specifically an analogous one involving clitoral hood removal) under the same reasoning?
t1_du9cgg7	0	*	Well, then you would have the choice.  As it is you're stuck with your slightly-less-than-a-penis :(  I'd be bitter too.
t1_du95fs4	0	*	Yes, over three different incidents spanning several years. You said you've never seen or heard of it being done or mentioned. Now you have.

t1_dsotd3l	1	*	That's about what I was thinking. It's kinda impossible, unless we decide to let ourselves be punished.
t1_dsod7fa	1	*	You still can't fire on non-combatants. Neat story otherwise.
t1_duagnj2	0	*	> China doesn't have a drug war the same way we do.  Yes, exactly. US policy with regard to imprisoning drug users is *insane*.

t1_duvuhd6	0	*	Sadly enough he is not a troll and he actually believes this stuff. He has no idea about history as well.

t1_dtwkrzp	0	*	I'm unsure of the implication you're making.
t1_dtwoo4f	1	*	If one of those students did not undermine the rest of the class but you punished them anyways, it is still unjust.  But whatever, you don't care.
t1_duz3z2n	0	*	And now I understand your point Mr. Anarchy man
t1_dsc6g0k	0	*	Let me see tunisia, algeria,chad,niger all dangerous nations. You do know a terror attack was just foiled in both tunisia and niger and chad right? Algeria also has terror cells.

t1_dt1ywl8	0	*	I recommend you to read the second section of Das Kapital (the actual part explaining why finance from feudalist to capitalist society is flawed in the first place).
t1_dsk91vg	1	*	It's not an either/or situation. We're the richest country in the history of the world. 
t1_due2d5e	1	*	Same is true for the US. Most people never have a house.fire either. I still have multiple fire extinguishers and make sure my kids know what to do.

t1_dukgf4j	0	*	Well, fuck it then, right?  Standing up to the subversion of democracy isn't worth it I guess.  True freedom is overrated anyway.
t1_dskvno7	1	*	Okay.  So what?
t1_dslws8p	0	*	I don't think Trump ever said they were. That's just people reading their preconceived notions into what he actually did say. 
t1_dugxtl4	1	*	That's refreshing to hear mate. Hopefully we can keep building this bridge together as allies/developed nations.
t1_duhuioq	1	*	I think Germany has quite a good social security system so I wouldn't worry about it.   But I'm happy to hear that your country is coming around good with elections and a working justice system.
t1_dug8dhq	0	*	As an American, please know that we arent all a bunch of idiotic know-it-alls. The majority of us recognize the very challenging situation Iraq is in and wish you all the best.

t1_dujsj64	1	*	Unless it's less than 20% then there's participation. Even a country like America with an *actual* election only has like 60% participation.
t1_duj5c6b	1	*	My point was that even gay sex is less gay than having two fem long haired guys sitting on your lap kissing you gently.
t1_dujexi1	0	*	And that'll definitely go to my hairdresser?
t1_duj9sre	1	*	> torture and disown gays aren't comming from Moscow but from Chechnya higher-ups and local culture, although Moscow admitedly don't do enough to stop it.  We're in agreement on this.
t1_duj7iga	0	*	Because a Republican-lead investigation about a Democratic politician didn't lead to the Democrat being jailed. So he's angry about it.
t1_duj8mhr	0	*	Yep. But I'd say it's quite unlikely they'd be used as regular grunts, during recruiter visit. BTW, a general recruiting someone is a quite unlikely scenario as well.
t1_dujf29b	1	*	This!

t1_dum5hdm	1	*	pray tell, explain. 
t1_dswosxn	1	*	Venezuela isn't any different than Attlee's UK or 70's Sweden in terms of its state control. It's not a matter of it being socialism if its good or bad. Cuba is socialist and so was the USSR.

t1_dswg01k	1	*	I just started learning very very introductory Python by myself last month, and Unicode is pretty cool indeed!
t1_dsuuixs	1	*	Because the racists' claim was that white people simply refuse to do manual labor and it's demonstrably false?   Are you stupid or just pretending?
t1_dsusm82	0	*	He never said that we should allow immigration from anywhere.   youre creating a straw man argument

t1_dsuxu8j	1	*	I thought red hats were supposed to be alphas and not so insensitive hmm
t1_dsvxr6j	1	*	Our imposing words or titles on observed phenomena doesn't mean the word or there relationship have any inherent meaning. Is that what you're meaning?  If not, could you elaborate a bit more?

t1_dsuzvf4	1	*	Great standards.
t1_dsutpk2	0	*	Missed that.  Dont need to be a dick. 40 is a pretty pathetic thing for Trump care about. 
t1_dsut0ti	0	*	Ah yes one 5,000,000th of the population coming here from a destroyed Island is taking all the jobs.  What are you, a socialist? Gotta fix the market to make sure every American has a job!

t1_dsusd9z	0	*	For that to happen, Republicans would have to be able to govern.
t1_dsuywqx	0	*	Everyone has met a xenophobic Republican, but that wasn't what I responded to. Even the xenophobic ones actually chum up some respect for the folks who come here legally and work their ass off.
t1_dsvanfg	1	*	When youre entire argument is personal attacks, calling people lazy bastards and lost causes then you dont have an argument.
t1_dsuwobs	0	*	> he called the Republicans who showed up to protest taking down the statue fine people.  You realize you just equated Republicans with neo-nazis and the KKK? Yikes
t1_dsv6dqp	0	*	I think theres a difference between predicting future action and opening your eyes and seeing whats happening. Im not predicting future action, Im talking about current events
t1_dsuto28	0	*	I feel that any time I spend replying to you is just time thrown down the drain.  You deliberately ignored my point so that you could be obnoxiously contrarian.
t1_dsut8bb	0	*	You seem to be the one misunderstanding bruvnor.
t1_dsvg0j0	0	*	You disagree that it would look less discriminatory if he banned all temporary work visas than it would if he only banned a select few countries?
t1_dsuss30	1	*	I had to explain the whole drink the KoolAid thing to a twenty something Trump fan.  He had never heard of Jones. 
t1_dsvfj8g	0	*	Ok ok fair enough. You have to admit from my point of view it looked ridiculous. One of those How the hell did you end up with that? situations.
t1_dsvak4l	1	*	He probably assumed the Republican Establishment would have acted less like little children when he said that.
t1_dsuthci	0	*	What makes *you* say that urban areas don't care about rural areas?  Urban areas basically pay the bills for low population rural areas. 
t1_dsv8q00	1	*	I don't get it.  We are talking about americans moving overseas. What american jobs are you talking about?
t1_dsutnrz	0	*	So once they do it you will retract your statement and apologize?

t1_dsusdqz	0	*	I think I know that guy. 
t1_dsvd9dz	0	*	What makes them worthless?
t1_dsv9ean	0	*	Because we have welfare programs for Americans while they remain in shelters and look for work, much as Republicans would like to gut it, while immigrants don't have that luxury, probably.
t1_dsv0825	0	*	That's hilarious lol
t1_dsuwutp	0	*	Damn so Trump is just doing this as a dick swinging measure. The numbers are not as consequential. 
t1_dsuuwqt	1	*	Why not, heh.

t1_dsuyeis	0	*	And racism is a policy it is worth being against.
t1_dsv2hxq	1	*	There hasnt been any data presented here - even speculatively- about crossers that werent caught. On what basis would you assume that group would be >>630k?
t1_dsvvfps	0	*	Anyone else find it funny that in the end this was two Danes randomly arguing with each other about voting motivation in the US. 
t1_dsvtefr	0	*	What's your point? (I mean that genuinely; I feel I'm missing something?)
t1_dsvm8i5	1	*	Np and yeah Lybia was a a major fuck-up.

t1_dsveq40	0	*	Staring yourself blind at results compared between nations is very bad thing, and what I was refering too. What do you care what other nations show in their results? 
t1_dsknw9g	1	*	Congressmen are just as responsible for foreign relationships as the president is.
t1_dslblzg	0	*	Just trying to talk to you in words you understand.  Like my original comment said, compared to every other industrialized nation the US is a shit hole.  
t1_dskc9z0	1	*	hey, at least we had better ships!

t1_du15jjo	1	*	You thought this was a Tide ad, but it was a cover by me, DIO!
t1_du18d0h	0	*	The ex socialist countries in Eastern Europe will not ameliorate by following the Western model. Western policies are not suitable for countries with differently shaped system.

t1_dsxwm0n	1	*	Oh I know. The Commonwealth had been partitioned over a century before
t1_dtklsvh	1	*	Also not treating people addicted to drugs like criminals but giving them proper treatment might also help, but what do I know.
t1_dsha9rc	1	*	Also we have made efforts to change our system. California for example has done everything it can on the state level. 
t1_dsh820f	0	*	Your comment did not say that. It disagreed with the statement that Churchill was responsible for the deaths of more people than many of the Nazi's at Nuremberg, which made you factually wrong.
t1_dsigwuj	1	*	True!
t1_dsguxuw	1	*	>Probably grainy  >>ISIS  Pick one. Those dudes are using Ultra HD cameras and shooting at 60fps most of the time.

t1_dsiixf0	1	*	Just check your money and see whose face is on it
t1_dst05es	1	*	To make things more fucked up, the cartel members were trying to behead him with the scythe but it was too dull, so they started hacking away with a box cutter.  
t1_dsskk6p	1	*	The bible is many different books put together written years between eachother.
t1_dsskrpl	1	*	Not like the child soldiers ever get to see the actual diamonds. As if that would even make it better.
t1_dst4wof	1	*	Well, shit. :-/
t1_dssjc7n	0	*	I reiterate the fact that this differs in no way from what we Christians did during the dark ages. So yeah, it's a matter of societal development.

t1_dst17l0	1	*	It sickens me that these people continue their petty feuds and never stop to think of their children.
t1_dsssx2y	1	*	Why in a thread about war is your first assumption murderer? One crazy enough to casually bring up his crime scenes on Reddit? Dude's almost certainly a Soldier or Marine.
t1_dstaswf	0	*	I knew some of them were where did you get most

t1_dst55dp	1	*	I hope you got all the fucking medals, every single one of them.
t1_dssiwrt	1	*	It is because history is boring, right. There hasn't been any lessons learned for all the crap we have done...
t1_dssvg63	0	*	These threads was making me think of one of the worst videos I saw and this one came exactly to mind.  Its like fucked up isn't enough to describe what happened.  
t1_dswkkaq	1	*	You can thank Ford for that. He hated Jews and how they controlled the world.  So he pretty much controlled the design of America so that we'd depend on his cars.  Isn't it ironic?
t1_dsvuh9k	1	*	I know the feeling... some people have it worse. If you always remember that, might make you feel better :)
t1_dsx3h1e	0	*	I think Obama proved that the President is a figurehead when it comes to this country's leadership.  Trump just made it obvious that the President is the easiest target for most people to get behind.
t1_dt426yh	0	*	So the CCP is paying you for this line too?
t1_dt4vd1c	0	*	by your logic, Russia should have gone to the sidelines decades ago.

t1_dti1v0r	1	*	Again, you've made no actual argument, provided no evidence for me to ignore or refute in the first place. When you do, then maybe we would actually be having a conversation.

t1_dtg5hge	1	*	Isn't that what happens within states?  Or does the Michigan countryside somehow have more of a voice than Detroit?
t1_dtg2c6r	1	*	In my opinion, the answer to that is in the modern US being a faithless elector would be career suicide
t1_dtg1z5j	1	*	It's a loop that progressively reinforces itself.   There already needs to be something there for them to spin the crap they do.  
t1_dtgpcdt	0	*	Thats a great way of avoiding the actual issue, which is that the system in the USA pretty much maximizes wasted votes.
t1_dtg9vei	1	*	Hold on. People are buying avocado toast in restaurants?  People are paying $14 for some avocado on toast?!  I'm a millennial who loves avocado, toast, and combination of, but wtf.

t1_dttvdph	0	*	No it isnt. Thats not how any of this works at all.   Coal and oil need very specifix conditions to form.. Coal will likely never form again and oil is unlikely
t1_dtu2l18	0	*	What about elephants or whales? Please don't tell me they rape monkeys or something like that. I'm still traumatized by what sea lions and otters do.

t1_duisg33	0	*	For better or worse, parents hold all their childrens rights. And its much better a parent deciding than angst ransoms who have no experience in what they are talking about.

t1_dsqia6f	0	*	Stuff the poverty rates, how expensive are their burgers?  That was your argument, after all.  That paying your workers would mean raising prices to the point of '$40 burgers'.  
t1_dtslm3i	1	*	Of course I'm not saying it's a good thing.

t1_dsml7aa	1	*	It was bought from a bankruptcy auction lower than market value, and was on the market for $125 million in 2006.  So he sold it for $30 million less than he originally asked for.   
t1_dtrk100	1	*	Of course the quality of the care is not the problem, the problem is the lack of care. We all fucking know that. The quality of care is pretty much around the same level in any develeped country.
t1_dv0qqws	1	*	That's at least arguable. It seems that a fellow citizen telling me my own government may spy on me is different from a fellow citizen telling Germans our government spies on them.

t1_dv14u4m	0	*	I disagree. Saying 'I don't like these guys' then posting their propaganda is bullshit
t1_dv0p7c7	0	*	Then she should've fought to repel it, not break it and then have people like you crying about it.

t1_dtw1zga	1	*	filming and exploding rocket on the drone ship gets you more PR than you could buy with 100 times the budget it would cost to film.   
t1_dtv3p1v	1	*	I Fence it.
t1_dtvb122	1	*	That's just capitalism. My production company already made hostile takeover to original 3 company and now its our business. This escalated fast.
t1_dtumk19	0	*	Electric rockets are sufficient for that. The big problem is the energy source. Nuclear fission won't do it.
t1_dsrw45s	1	*	How forceful are honest words!
t1_dsiy3nm	0	*	I've traveled for two months. Lots of idiots, lots of cool people, like anywhere. Nothing made me think I should go home and act like I'm better than everyone else.
t1_dsi7qd4	0	*	You don't have to answer, obviously, but what is it that you do that allows you to buy multiple properties, visit multiple countries, and live so comfortably?
t1_dsok6f9	1	*	My name is not Dmitri, but your inference is spot on; I do care about all humans equally, no matter their race or geographical location.
t1_dsi3tqt	0	*	Please, no amount of neutrality can grant fox journalistic integrity. Cable news is had in general but Fox is a special case in awful.
t1_dshu7oz	0	*	The US had a couple million slaves for a few hundred years. Russia had hundreds of millions of slaves for about one thousand years. What a ridiculous statement you make. 
t1_dshzta1	0	*	Nobody is doing that, your example is dumb as hell. 
t1_dsi8l00	0	*	Dubstep works too, I guess
t1_dsido37	1	*	Now we're on to something
t1_dshrf5h	0	*	So threesomes for everyone? (That means there's at least some gay going on in each one).
t1_dsi3loz	1	*	Yes, what if everything is a lie. It's possible! Therefore we can't ever decide on anything. It's a wonder we're able to talk to each other.   Dormroom blather.
t1_dsitbn3	0	*	I'm white. I'm an immigrant to Africa.
t1_dshu2be	1	*	Glad you agree champ 
t1_dshs0sk	0	*	Sounds good to me
t1_dshuacq	1	*	Ah civilization the most dangerous game
t1_dsilz0h	0	*	why did you delete your comment? It was perfectly reasonable in my opinion. I am legitimately trying to foster a conversation here not an argument.
t1_dsiv2az	0	*	It's a village with like 10 Russian families living there, I can find out a bit more if you're interested. 
t1_dsi3qyq	1	*	Chinese people are smart.
t1_dsic1q5	0	*	Who cares that the US has propped up ruthless dictators in other countries and funded rebel terrorist groups! At least it's not as bad as Mao, Stalin, and Kim Jong Il/Un! /s
t1_dsc470x	0	*	Why do people ask for citations for things that cannot possibly be cited to their satisfacti- oh.  Nevermind.
t1_duvelc7	0	*	I have discussed this stuff at length with most of my friends. I still dont think you know what youre talking about. Where are you from?
t1_dtjdhp7	0	*	> are you saying the comment wasn't edgy?  yes I am. it's a knee jerk reaction.  > people calling for a peaceful boycott   they're just peacefully suing them.. see how it works? 
t1_dt9lteh	0	*	Well, sure. But you seem misinformed about lots of things regarding both.
t1_ds93zxd	0	*	Children should go to school and not slave away on a sewing machine for 18 hours a day. Is that a good enough argument for your child slave labor loving ways? 
t1_dsrpby8	1	*	Wow Sry to hear that crazy..
t1_dss7d9a	1	*	What's that?
t1_dsu42en	0	*	Wouldn't innocence be up to interpretation? 
t1_dssakck	0	*	I guess that's why China with its skewed gender ratio is the terrorism centre of the universe.
t1_dsse1zi	0	*	Evangelicals who want to emulate these guys in throwing gays off buildings are very religious, so that's where it breaks down... 
t1_dsnrxbn	0	*	Ah my bad then. I misunderstood your earlier statement. 
t1_du49m1y	1	*	The latter produces the former without fail.
t1_du42i3m	1	*	Significantly less than 30% of US eligible voters voted for Trump, are you saying that low turnout invalidates an election result? 
t1_du45gvj	1	*	I guess we have a new fallacy for when we want to say if they can put a man on the moon then...
t1_du4hsll	1	*	U think brake dust is contained?
t1_du408dt	1	*	Hahaha, hey guys, why didn't the government do more at the state level to help catch Bruce McArthur???! What a bunch of *idiots!*

t1_dsee2g3	0	*	and Bernie?
t1_dsajspc	0	*	Ive already said, its another opportunity for stories to mismatch. And it begs the question, why are Russians so easy to find in trump tower that you can run into them at the elevator?
t1_dsvpump	1	*	When your field is flooded with H-1B workers that depress wages, assuming you can find work *at all*, get back to me with what you think.
t1_duhrx79	0	*	Your argument is just all over the place and it makes no sense.  It was not. It was the push for the individual to have rights which were in every man from birth given by god. Thats what pushed it.
t1_dujyhln	1	*	GOT EM!
t1_duhu9me	0	*	I tried but it was too long. 
t1_ds4wgad	1	*	> that news sources aren't willing to report it that way.   Thank you for proving my point
t1_ds4ukbk	1	*	Lol, nice ad hominem. You really searched my post history for that weak insult? Damn that's sad.
t1_ds4q7q9	0	*	No but I do think it's inflated because of draconic drug laws meant to target minorities.  With POWER comes great responsibility, not Freedom.  Youre confusing safety and freedom.
t1_ds5i8iq	1	*	I literally followed the pattern for a meme, all that was missing is the image itself because I am lazy, pull the stick out your ass man.
t1_ds4qc2z	0	*	Jesus, that article has got to be satire, right?? :( 
t1_ds4utlq	0	*	Are you just obtuse or a troll?  The Tulsa mass-lynching occured in 1921, ten years before Stalin ordered a famine in the Ukraine that killed ten million people.
t1_ds4w1eo	0	*	Lol what's the difference with German cities? it still isn't a cost effective way of destroying military targets, but it is for civilian targets, if I haven't said that enough.
t1_ds6sjbq	0	*	Right...I am real worried about future generations being condemned to see the dead body of a violent thug in the street for a few hours...how will humanity survive?

t1_ds5cnik	0	*	Also weren't most of the rioters not actually from there, but a few towns over or something?
t1_ds4tgwy	1	*	Dude, anything you say is simple insults. We're not even having a conversation.
t1_ds6qc0u	1	*	You provided 0 arguments for your opinion.   I'd try to be less biased and nationalistic if I were you.
t1_ds8u3qg	1	*	Both of course. And just so you know the US can disappear people for that reason since Patriot Act at least. My city (Chicago) literally has a black site where protesters were held.
t1_ds5apwo	0	*	I'm curious why.
t1_ds4vqut	0	*	It's RUSSIA.   You can safely write off anything that comes from Russia. Always.

t1_ds4qdse	1	*	>made up pseudo logical fallacy  Yep this guy is 100% Russian.
t1_ds4y6fh	0	*	Why should attention be directed towards my wrongdoing, rather than yours? Its not clear why one wrong deserves attention and another doesnt.
t1_dsuekl4	0	*	Any other country would've kicked him out of the office for all the shit he said and did so far. Yet in the US it's you just don't get him, he has a vision.  No he doesn't, he's a very stable genius. 
t1_dsudzxu	0	*	Not sure that America is an oligarchy. Why do you think so? Or did I misunderstand your point? 
t1_dsuvtvs	0	*	Agreed, in regards to the down-votes its whatever really. At least people read it and maybe heed it.
t1_dsuceg9	0	*	Obviously it is a mediocre form of government. But hey. Success is in the eye of the beholder. 
t1_dts6tru	0	*	It's arbitrary in the context of history.

t1_ds3hn6a	0	*	Link when they made those claims? 
t1_ds3o53r	1	*	I hadn't ever put two and two together!
t1_dt5v9gw	0	*	Right, the largest lobby in D.C. being a lobby for the state of Israel and a huge chunk of our Congress thinking Israel is part of some biblical prophecy isn't real.
t1_dt5uz1j	0	*	If there is one thing we should have learned from this administration, it's that outrage doesn't accomplish shit.
t1_dt5wb43	0	*	Its not my country.
t1_dt69e6k	0	*	Do you feel, a coordinated attack from Chinese troll or bots can greatly influence the public? There's no doubt other have created more. 
t1_dt5w2tx	0	*	Man he's the shittiest antichrist ever  Satanists should ask for their money back
t1_dt5uyjv	1	*	Yeah, if he ignores the investigation's findings then we're in full Facist Takeover mode. I mean, we already are but that's when it will get even scarier and more serious.
t1_dt71742	1	*	Yea and welcome to big tent politics.
t1_dt635b5	0	*	So? What does that mean? Are you seriously trying to say that Trump inviting the Clintons to his wedding a decade ago is the same as Mueller donating to the exact person Trump beat?
t1_dt6dpei	0	*	What? No. But my recollection of the reason for impeachment was committing perjury. Not getting a blowie.
t1_dt68m67	1	*	Strzock luring Flynn into an interview to make him unintentionally perjury himself is hardly a good catch, same thing with indicting Manafort on charges unrelated to the Trump campaign.
t1_dt6dige	1	*	Yes, they think Trump won in a landslide because they believe propaganda and fake news.
t1_dt62upt	1	*	My god they sacrificed disco for immortality.
t1_dt5w27k	0	*	Yeah but why pick that example? 
t1_dt5xxu8	0	*	God forbid a 1st word country invests in its population. U0001f602
t1_dt63wk1	1	*	Oh sorry yeh i agree.  I also don't think it would be a terrible idea despite thinking the russia thing is quite a beat up.  Would need a lot of fleshing out though.
t1_dt61i06	0	*	But Trump hasn't passed Trump's agenda either... 
t1_dt6m75x	1	*	Agree.   It matters of you want to know where we are trending toward.
t1_dt5r6xb	1	*	are you mentally challenged, he just directly quoted trump
t1_dt71bex	1	*	I would but... no liquidity in these markets.
t1_dt5w4az	1	*	Obviously not now. If our democracy needs defended then I won't just let it die
t1_dt6744q	1	*	Technically it was his mistress, but your larger point still stands. Mueller knows exactly what he's doing.
t1_dt6sh8t	1	*	The DOJ is an executive branch agency.  I don't like that they limit themselves in this way.
t1_dt5y0tx	0	*	How does Flynn conducting diplomacy on behalf of the Trump campaign with the Russian ~~foreign secretary~~ ambassador (edit to cope with brain fart) constitute Trump working with Russia, you mean?
t1_dt5zm42	0	*	Well then why bring it up? Sorry for using a feature on Reddit that's available to everyone ?   Are you just trying to pick a fight or something? Let's hug.
t1_dt66ny1	1	*	Yes, he lost the popular vote by millions and his approval ratings are the lowest of any President in their first year in history.
t1_dt6itv7	0	*	So political dirt is okay, just not foreign dirt? 
t1_dt5vj1k	0	*	What, the pressure from Trump? 
t1_dt62zko	0	*	Soooo wouldn't that be worse for Mueller?
t1_dt6500l	0	*	Aw shit. Well... That's depressing. Hope I'm not shadow banned! It'll he like real life conversations all over again.
t1_dt6illj	1	*	At the very least, he's the distilled product of runaway Republican avarice.
t1_dt69fim	0	*	Sorry I got off the wrong foot but now I fully understand what you meant.
t1_dt6740f	1	*	But the headline is accurate, even altered, given the paragraph I've just cited again?  I don't get it.
t1_dt084vw	1	*	I replied to a senator. I didnt even say anything or repeat anyone. Keep trying though. 
t1_dsha4gd	0	*	Denying the Holocaust is considered breaching its victims right to human dignity.
t1_dsk9e64	1	*	So do you want a higher wage or lower prices... make up your mind lmao
t1_dsu0e0m	1	*	In Sweden everyone gets five weeks paid vacation, no matter the job, *by law*. It's called the vacationlaw and we've had it since 1976...
t1_dsuavch	0	*	That really sucks, I feel for you. Hope it gets better soon. Way I see it, if Trump can be President, then nearly anything can change.
t1_dsv6wpg	1	*	Perhaps you're just assuming all the egalitarian feminists you meet aren't feminists because you have a preconceived notion that feminists aren't egalitarian.
t1_dv4sjf4	1	*	In what way does one state committing a horrible act make another state doing horrible acts better? 
t1_dv4j0wk	0	*	Lol true
t1_dv49xoa	1	*	Portuguese here. He is 100% correct. 
t1_dv46g5k	0	*	So the Russians had a valid reason to annex Crimea?
t1_ds35g4l	0	*	Wow calm your horses buddy jesus. Take a deep breath and smoke some dank weed
t1_ds3sn7j	0	*	I think you're misreading those statistics, Australia has significantly more per capita animal deaths than the US does.
t1_ds3mdyx	1	*	No continental shelf between Australia and PNG. Torres Strait, between the two, is 7m to 15m deep.
t1_dsir56b	0	*	Whatever, I don't care. 
t1_dt18s34	1	*	Would you want me to?
t1_dshea9l	1	*	Links to sources. Gross. Downvote.
t1_dskvtmw	0	*	And I disagreed with you. Suck it up and move on.  I think you think wrong too. So I guess we are at a stalemate.
t1_dshhnco	0	*	Congratulations!  You just said You're wrong!  And you're dumb!  Good argument.  You could, y'know, state your case as to why you think I'm wrong, but that might require you to engage in a discussion.
t1_du4phh2	1	*	No, I believe what you posted.
t1_dtdefg5	0	*	I get your 'point', it's just profoundly retarded and not grounded in reality.  Do you understand what the word 'hypocrisy' means? 
t1_dty9y7e	1	*	Lol
t1_duq0e24	0	*	Hahah adapt and overcome what? We havent fucked the earth this hard until now. 
t1_dsl8ii2	0	*	Attacking my post history is not advancing an argument. If you feel compelled to advance a real argument I'd be happy to debate you. 
t1_dsdjjsf	1	*	And proof?
t1_dv29bjb	0	*	In the U.K. we chose .22. Its not possible to own a calibre larger than that in semi auto
t1_dsxudfw	1	*	I like some milspec food surplus from time to time. 
t1_dsvr24t	0	*	But now we're in the nuclear age, and we need to tread even more lightly. There's no easy solution I'm afraid.
t1_dsw9qt4	1	*	Fair point. 
t1_dtuk1qa	1	*	It's a separate country
t1_dtva34j	0	*	The negotiate are for unity of the party. You don't have to convince me btw, I am just telling you the facts on the ground. If you disagree, then you can contact the PA, they have press office. 
t1_dtsistu	1	*	To be fair,  you don't have to be very intelligent in order to rebut your claims.
t1_dtxh7xm	0	*	That's not firing a shot, and Israel lied to the world about who shot first. Go read Wikipedia.
t1_dtsvz5o	1	*	Over 700 million dollars in 2016 alone isn't negligible, Mr. Gates. Almost all of it is given to unaccountable government entities and the UNRWA.
t1_dtt5w46	1	*	Why not?
t1_dtbs0f6	0	*	If it was my decision we would have never got involved in the middle-east. 6 trillion dollars wasted and we made the situation even worse.
t1_dta4v59	0	*	It was not phrased as an opinion.
t1_ds3tqys	0	*	You love Hillary, just admit it.
t1_du4094h	1	*	Ah, well that makes it alright, then. I suppose you support forced sex segregation, too. 
t1_ds8y6qy	0	*	> Do you have a question that isnt moronic   I feel like youve made my point here.
t1_dts0r4m	1	*	Again, not my point. Other brands of solar panel systems will also return your investment after half a dozen to a dozen years (depending on the solar power subsidies). 
t1_dump2u3	1	*	Yeah but we'll be dead then so who cares /s
t1_dums0tq	0	*	I didnt make any assumptions about Nigeria but my mention of the microcosm is from personal experience.

t1_du721xo	0	*	So...be Hitler?
t1_ds9wlx4	0	*	You are very willfully ignorant when it's been shown you are blatantly wrong. And once proven wrong you double down on the crazy.

t1_dsg64qv	0	*	You think Id read a Trump document? Ha! No I only read reputable sources. 
t1_dsb8vyx	0	*	Honestly I'm not sure if you're legit or not bro, but I dig it. Carry on. 
t1_dsb978h	0	*	You've just put a lot of words in my mouth and chosen anger and assault as your communication method, no wonder you will continue to be disconnected with the reality of the situation
t1_dsavg20	0	*	There are reasons why illegal immigration is an issue. You can have a right-wing opinion and not sound like a complete idiot. I think youre way off mark here.
t1_dsb195c	0	*	> Unemployment numbers only measure the unemployed that are actively seeking employment nor does it measure the under-employed.  I know this, but they're still pretty low right now.   
t1_dsb32bp	1	*	What country do you live? I tought that the US was the only country which had Fox News
t1_dsbhxtd	0	*	Yeah i think people should work hard to develop skills and we should make sure the time spent at school is well allocated.
t1_dsclj3n	0	*	I think we can use the money we have allocated now better before we need to consider increasing costs for the moment.
t1_dsbk1x1	1	*	Nobody said Kim Jong Un is competent. Trump is just more incompetent. 
t1_dsb7kdh	1	*	For what it's worth there are many like me who are heartbroken and haunted by the plight of North Koreans.   And your points are will taken. 
t1_dsb7j3y	1	*	Seeing how America doesn't have nearly as high production as other countries in... most industries, yes. You, the citizens, would lose massively.
t1_dsg0gzz	0	*	They let two bombshell be dropped on them?   What the hell are YOU talking about?
t1_dsba9ef	0	*	Ah yes, the time when the world almost ended. Good times!
t1_dsb8nbg	0	*	How do you get a job in finance while being mentally retarded?
t1_dsb39eo	1	*	Maybe it's because of the internet, but every trump supporter i've met has been a staunch supporter of the mexican border wall
t1_duk858h	1	*	Apparently.
t1_dtxi85g	0	*	It probably should, you're right. Must have been a marketing choice. Maybe they liked having the word 'Great' in the team name?
t1_dty7ir8	0	*	That and overhaul the water allotment of farms. Ban all water intensive crops like cotton and almonds from being grown and we can have a good start on that front.
t1_dtxzmcz	1	*	I'll give you food.
t1_dtxns7j	1	*	Fair enough, I liked your piece, though some paragraph breaks would be nice :)
t1_dtyw1gi	1	*	Common law from Britain. What country are you in?
t1_dtxrt5p	1	*	I live in Ottawa so house prices are ok especially considering Im a coder and there are programming jobs everywhere here. 
t1_dty2xte	0	*	Would you be for including Mexico to that list? If you notice, UK, Canada, AUS and NZ are fairly equal in development levels. Imagine adding Mexico to that mix? 
t1_dtxooal	1	*	It would be to all the countries. 
t1_dtxm0yy	0	*	That screams of an issue with minimum wages not immigration...
t1_dtxrwmo	1	*	And the women are still largely stay-at-home.
t1_dtxjyou	1	*	Your arguement doesnt suit the meme boi /s
t1_dtxf312	1	*	There's a world of difference between 'visit without much restrictions' and 'free movement'
t1_dtxtfng	1	*	You should surely know more than anyone the truth of this! 
t1_dtxkikw	0	*	Fair enough.   > there are passport/identity checks when travelling to UK from other EU countries, except via ROI-NI border  could be read either way, I suppose.
t1_dtxgsgr	0	*	Fruit and vegetable picking, cleaning, etc? Jobs native Brits generally won't do for xa37.60 an hour.

t1_dtxgtll	0	*	You mean.. make Great Britain again? 
t1_dtxy3wm	1	*	Still the government collecting money to pay for ACC's operation.  Seems like a good system though - definitely one to look at if UBI becomes reality.
t1_dtxhrk1	1	*	Hey, us New Brunswickers can afford to do lots of fun things thanks to our low mortgage payments! As long as you have a car and time, that is...
t1_dsxdhzd	0	*	Lol don't want an unwanted child? Commit to abstinence. It's really fucking simple. When it's literally not her choice (ie. Rape) i agree that abortion should be an option 
t1_dswpexf	1	*	No, I'm pretty sure murdering a child is worse. 
t1_dswsr2l	0	*	> the laws that the government enact must pass a examination before the court  I have read up on this, but who appoints the court? The government. Courts can be easily influenced
t1_dsx3ifq	0	*	Are you for real? WTF. The government isn't going to support anti-semitism. That's one of the most ridiculous things I've ever heard.
t1_dswoi65	0	*	Wouldn't anti-abortion activists just argue that they are advocating for the unborn child's rights? your argument doesnt hold up
t1_dswrhir	0	*	It's because we're American.   Also, winning at the Olympics is easy because there's only Americans.
t1_dsx0n6g	1	*	Oh, homicide, the legal term.  I thought we were talking about murder, the moral term.
t1_dswqqgb	0	*	What the hell is that even supposed to mean?
t1_dswqvn0	1	*	I'd love to, to be honest. I've got plenty more popcorn to go through.
t1_dswm52a	0	*	Yes, that is why there is nothing morally wrong with expecting mothers shooting heroin, smoking crack, or drinking alcohol. After all there is no life in her.
t1_dswlzys	1	*	Answer the question on the merits?  Also neocon doesn't mean jack anymore, so get with the times, Gramps.U0001f604
t1_dswwomo	0	*	You are ceasing to even make sense anymore. Or did you reply the to the wrong comment?
t1_dswn3cn	0	*	Maybe this is just a regional thing, but I interpret pro-abortion as the same thing as pro-choice. Basically supporting it being completely safe, legal, and free from judgement. 
t1_dswp0pu	1	*	I know, and I don't agree with that view. I'm just being an asshole.
t1_dswqpel	0	*	Im not religious. I am an aetheist.
t1_dsyj0b7	1	*	I think I replied to the wrong comment.   Sorry guys. I deserve the downvotes on this one. Lol
t1_dswvw73	1	*	Yeah, Ill concede that. I admit I only heard about that in rumors and couldnt find anything else to support it earlier. Guess that warrants some more research on the other stuff once I get off work. 
t1_dsy2wg0	0	*	Right implies that we are guaranteed access to. We have the ability to apply for access but it is not a right. Big distinction from the states.
t1_dsxhgjr	0	*	As I understand it we have civil law rather than common law (like the rest of canada) and while we are still subject to federal laws, Quebec's law has its own criminal code as well. 
t1_dswtgkv	1	*	The guy you are arguing with might need an eli5 on this one.

t1_dswmnc0	1	*	good point
t1_dswrwox	1	*	Failure of birth control?
t1_dsxu4tw	0	*	> Rofl, literally what? No, just no.  Every embryology textbook disagrees with you. And you laugh why? Why is that funny to you? 
t1_dswrd6u	0	*	No, the wording is if you do not respect the rights of these Canadians then you're ineligible.  You can respect someone's rights without agreeing with them.
t1_dsx754l	0	*	Yes. I am the child here.
t1_dswq07d	0	*	Rape?  
t1_dswpha4	1	*	Stop comparing racism with abortion. It's ignorant as hell and honestly rather disgusting that you're even trying. Respect the rights of women or don't speak at all, man.

t1_dswrh1f	0	*	He's saying that you were exactly like the fetus before and that is a fact.

t1_dswpp1i	0	*	You cant force a person not to kill someone, then not be financially responsible for that someone?
t1_dswzvdi	1	*	No, it means the GOP primary voters didn't value that trait this time.
t1_dswp9uj	0	*	Wow. But why dont you answer my question? Why shouldnt it be legal to have black people as slaves? I was only using the same logic youre using so I must be correct as well shouldnt I?
t1_dswmnx6	1	*	but they're not credible.  at all.  
t1_dswsr1s	1	*	Yeah, don't even get me started on the problems of the EC.
t1_dswps44	1	*	oh ok
t1_dswlgqf	1	*	So you believe a seed is a tree and an egg yolk is a bird?

t1_dsx05m8	0	*	I dont know what your saying. The chip on your shoulder is too big.
t1_dsx1iof	0	*	And you have completely fallen into crazy town. Whatever you got to tell yourself man, but not getting free money by the government is not discrimination
t1_dsya4zk	0	*	So you consider a foetus human and fully legal even before it could be extracted in emergency and live. It makes 0 sense.
t1_dswu4r1	1	*	I don't get it, these were things that the Harper government openly went for. They actually considered it a positive move with their voter base, it's not a conspiracy.
t1_dsxukyl	0	*	I don't think their position matters on funding and I don't think that is what they were saying.
t1_dtcrqxz	0	*	This right here is either a quality troll, (great work if so,) or an absolute zombie.

t1_dtau2os	1	*	Two separate patties that both weigh 0.1134 kg before they're cooked. To with cheese and put them in a bun. 
t1_dt9cn4j	1	*	How is that evidence lolol
t1_dt9bbu2	1	*	Well then we're pretty fucked considering that trump one with less votes than Romney and democrats just didn't vote 
t1_dt9deqa	0	*	You dont really believe Arpiao is a better source of news than the NYT, do you?
t1_dtazyph	0	*	Making a story attract readers is part of the media's job. Some sensationalize others write good headlines. This was indeed framed to illustrate American stupidity. What you call bias isn't.

t1_dt9ixs2	1	*	This should be out where more people will find it! I only dug this deep in the comments thanks to insomnia. Fantastic work!
t1_dt9nfdi	1	*	Considering hes a huge advocate for Trump and would look for any reason to discredit the report, yes. 
t1_dtana8s	1	*	Which is why they will wait till after the investigation. They can then place all the blame on the FBI instead of themselves and Trump at that point. 
t1_dtavxof	1	*	I'm sure you would say that about the colonists after the Boston Massacre too.
t1_dtaua7e	1	*	A competent zealot that was in bed with Trump? Yeah, i don't like that.
t1_dt9cwph	1	*	That man has the credibility of a pile of dog shit. He's a blithering idiot and a racist. 
t1_dtb6845	0	*	Lol if damaging property and pillaging cities is terrorism then we better send half of Seattle and Southern California to Guantanamo.   You know what? Maybe it is terrorism after all.

t1_ds5h9na	0	*	lol give some counter evidence then. 
t1_duo63v4	1	*	No fair! You weren't supposed to actually look into their false propaganda. You were just supposed to accept it at face value after they've repeated it enough. 
t1_duoh84u	0	*	Good Lord. Deflect, deflect, deflect. Is this protocol at the troll farm? Quit while you're behind bud.

t1_dsiv8ah	0	*	That is a naive statement, a lot of Americans agree with trump on anything he says. Would you really want to risk your life?
t1_dsivjwp	0	*	A thing can have more than one purpose. The EC also prevents the populous states from unproportionatly outweighing the smaller states.
t1_dsixxa6	0	*	'But I thought the USDA was food, not school exams?'
t1_dsis3cs	0	*	Or if you live in the South, Ohio, Indiana, etc that went Trump. You voted for the candidate that got the most votes, but your vote didn't count.
t1_dskck6m	1	*	She didnt quit her job (shameful as it was) because it was hard.    She quit because there was a fortune to be made in speaking fees.

t1_duetb8g	0	*	What was 9-11?
t1_dugpxt8	1	*	India & Pakistan. Even in 1999 *after* both had nukes.  That said, I largely agree with your post, and India/Pakistan don't let it escalate precisely due to those nukes.
t1_duf89dp	1	*	Convince the majority of the others it's in their best interest.
t1_dtp55ph	1	*	Ahaha people aren't eating enough carbs. Yes. I can't stand those Paleo douchebags.
t1_ds62vkc	0	*	Any capable government by default will be anti-pakistan. Afghans are tired of the haaqani network which is supported by Pakistan. 
t1_dsa7fxb	0	*	Those are social ideologies, foreign policies are largely unchanged due to political changes domestically. (and that's a good thing IMO)
t1_ds9wml3	0	*	China doesn't have that power. No worry about that, but it's a bad idea to dismiss that it's actually a growing power. 
t1_ds6mci9	1	*	Nothing happens in international relations on 'goodwill'. I don't want to point out everything wrong with the answer, but surely it sounds fictional to any neutral reader?
t1_ds612h1	0	*	No it does not, and this conversation isn't about that..
t1_dv0dpjb	0	*	This didnt work over a thousand years ago, why would it now?
t1_ds4c8bt	0	*	Well, I guess they looked at the number of innocent babies the IDF and netanyahu killed and came to the same conclusion about you.  Go figure.
t1_dtv7ded	0	*	You go on ranting about Brexit = racism, I am merely showing you an example of why Bremain also equals racism.  Do you UNDERSTAND? Are you COHERANT? 
t1_duaedlv	1	*	I gave you a great plan in which you are choosing to ignore and then using a straw man to change the subject. But hey, thanks for the uncouth remarks. I will be sure to add them in the report notes. 
t1_duz7g0d	0	*	Erdogan wasn't even President when that happened? And there was indeed a ceasefire in 2015-2016, but PKK broke it. If they want it, they're gonna get it, simple.
t1_dsrdbfr	1	*	There's a technique to them that I just can't pick up. Can't balance when squatting so I kinda have to half lie down just to make sure I don't fall in.
t1_du2rug6	1	*	Yes, of course it is - those countries would have destroyed Israel long ago, if they could have. What a stupid question. 
t1_du1pwsw	0	*	They're perfectly allowed to do anything they want in their territory. But they'll just have to take in mind that this will incur Israeli reaction.

t1_dv4j2lu	1	*	Great input, thanks for sharing. I can see you put a lot of thought into this. Care to expand?
t1_dsdl09n	0	*	The hell are you mad at me for? They're using numbers that aren't really a real thing for most people. I agree with their point, they should just use more realistic numbers.
t1_dt954v7	0	*	What they have to do right now is beg, because they got physical with a country much much larger than them and they're pretty much at the mercy of the IDF right now.
t1_dt8s2u8	1	*	And attacking first when the other country plans to attack, is in fact a defensive war. Defense in this context depends on intent.
t1_dt9ce71	1	*	Calm down, no need to downvote. u/DrProtic had just asked about his older interviews and you said he was pretty stupid, so i was just wondering what you thought about that. 
t1_dud88is	1	*	Shoulda, woulda, coulda.  I'm not crying over spilt milk, just pointing out the lessons we should be learning from. I can understand why that would irritate you.
t1_due52pu	1	*	Defeat by whom?     I think this is the crux of the issue, the people who complain about Japan seem to have some hatred of it.  It's time to get over it.
t1_ducjke7	0	*	What part of 'I am not responsible for the actions of people that lived long before I did' is not making sense to you?
t1_dudc385	0	*	You clearly do not comprehend what I said.
t1_ducjoxk	0	*	True, but only if you also acknowledge that without colonialism occurring, (most, India is the notable exception) colonial states would still be living in the stone age.
t1_dsgs1tk	1	*	Baha'is censored my comments [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/bahai/comments/7paw27/why_dont_bahai_people_live_in_israel/)  May I know why? What was wrong with my comments?
t1_duncskz	0	*	Theism is the belief in a god - a religion.   Atheism is the negative of it - the lack of religion.   Would you argue that homeless people do in fact have a home, just one that is invisible?

t1_du5vdkj	1	*	I didn't know they picked a peak year, I thought they picked 1990 because that was a trough.  Time to go read about Kyoto Protocols.

t1_dtpupc2	0	*	Bitcoin is what the majority decides it is and no amount of internet trolling on your part is going to make bCash turn into bitcoin.  The majority decided bitcoin should adopt Segwit so stop crying.
t1_duv3do7	1	*	And you are ignorant standing on your bs morals and fantasy. 
t1_ds85tez	0	*	I mean it is illogical to remove meat proteins from the human diet, which indirectly mean we have to have a livestock industry, abet hopefully smaller and more humane.

t1_dszlyp2	0	*	....which are?   Suggesting that Papa John would want the KKKs support (for any reason other than money from selling them pizza) is ludicrous. Anyone can see the negative PR coming from a mile away.

t1_dsjlsh8	0	*	Its patriotism.
t1_dsjbcax	0	*	Do you understand how the EC works?  The EC did not alter the outcome of the election at all.  The EC map *is* the outcome.  The popular vote is meaningless in a Presidential race.
t1_dsjhz1c	1	*	As guys we have a whole lot of cultural training to not show or even acknowledge feelings.   It's just another shitty thing about the world that needs to be worked on, and I'm glad you're doing it.

t1_duraz1m	1	*	It's been 19 years since Columbine.
t1_durcnwv	1	*	This is still innacurate. Average of 13,000 homicides by firearm per year. So 13,000/350,000,000=.003% 
t1_durzxig	1	*	That's exactly what I thought when I read it. Save your advice it will fall on deaf ears
t1_durzcph	1	*	Its funny that you say that because alot of people here think that if we had a 2 party system like yours that would fix our problems. Grass is always greener on the other side
t1_duc5f14	1	*	Yeah, and that is completly justified. It's a dumb statement, Israels goverment is not a representative of all jewish people.
t1_dt7deuv	1	*	I'm disappointed that you have a Regular Show username.

t1_dtt1u5l	0	*	1998 was literally decades ago
t1_dtt4ayn	1	*	Yeah I should say, I don't think it would be radically more secular necessarily. It would probably be far more democratic though.

t1_dspm25c	1	*	You don't know shit
t1_dt1njmj	1	*	I can assure you that I absolutely would never move to any of the shithole small towns and rural areas in red states, or in blue states; never to any red state or locality.  Never, ever.
t1_duj91tf	1	*	It certainly worked when I wanted everyone else to do a shot of absinthe on new years.

t1_dsevukz	1	*	Same here it sounds like a interesting enough world
t1_dsf0lo6	1	*	Considering there were people in Alabama who agreed the guy preyed on children but just didn't want Jones in office your last statement is unfortunately true.
t1_dsewmfz	1	*	Ok?
t1_dsetcdh	1	*	Then and now, but I preferred then.
t1_dsetwk0	0	*	As your articles suggest, this lawsuit has very little traction. I was expecting something a little more... Well, substantial. Your claim seems to have been very grandiose for what it really was.
t1_dtudzum	0	*	Oh, I see. That makes way more sense. I thought maybe you were from somewhere that didnt use crosswalks and I found that to be strange.
t1_ds3nszq	1	*	The right of a immigrate to not be deported if they're underage.  It's right in the news story you're commenting on,  chief. 
t1_dv6ppl4	1	*	But it is constructive to call russian bots, russian bots.  
t1_duneo4g	0	*	I think people think that 2040 or 2050 is a long time away but it really isn't anymore. Also I'm an ME its kinda my job.

t1_dunwf43	1	*	Heh
t1_dtt2ar0	1	*	Please cite the two ad hominems you think I threw your way so I can explain why you're wrong. Sounds like you're just trying to undermine my right to disagree with you by claiming victimhood.
t1_ds8o3bn	1	*	Mainly for Pakistan, as it allows Pakistan to be more assertive.
t1_ds8g9j1	0	*	That is one of the popular speculative arguments. You think Trump would sit on that evidence if he had one? He'd tweet it at 3 am US time.

t1_duy955d	1	*	Holy shit that's a new one to me.  So we have guns to stand up against the government, but the _litteral armed part of the government_ isn't something you have worry about?
t1_duypdnz	0	*	Talking about Europe as if it's one country is mind mindbogglingly retarded.   
t1_duz3bmf	1	*	I was talking about the populace. I'm not aware if any grass-roots movement trying to stiffen gun laws. 
t1_duylc4p	0	*	> People like myself are the last line of defense against the muh feelings people.  Ahahahahahahahahaha... Holy shit, you think you're some kind of crusader or some shit?  
t1_duz2e4b	1	*	It may be that the voice of those who do think its important is simply not represented in your media.
t1_duyc8p2	1	*	 by azura by azura by azura   its the reddit champion!
t1_duz8z8v	0	*	So you have no solution then.  Just a proposal that would create far more problems.
t1_duy4ev8	1	*	Ah the way you were saying it it seemed like you wanted gun control 
t1_dv07v7w	1	*	It is gibberish. He's right. 
t1_duxw1n4	1	*	>  any more than alcohol  That one I would disagree with, given the thousands of drunk driving deaths.
t1_duxsktp	1	*	You should repeal the 2nd. Arguing here with staunch gun advocates is just going to give you a hernia.   We don't change our minds on basic rights.

t1_dstnj8b	1	*	I do acknowledge it.
t1_dsuc6qp	1	*	I reopened my phone after a few hours sleep  and carried on reading this thread enjoying the DS9 posts ..Scrolled down to see North Korea. Now I'm totally confused.
t1_dsthsq6	0	*	True, and i do admit i was wrong. But when even the ridiculous bullshit sometimes is TRUE how the hell do we separate fact from fiction?
t1_dsul90p	0	*	I.... I still don't get it...  Is it because I'm not American?
t1_dstj9in	1	*	I have pinhead, not sure if you can get the other cenobites.

t1_ds32wh8	0	*	CIA has actively been working in destabilizing and overthrowing governments post-WW2. That is not a conspiracy, we've known this for decades..
t1_dskyyup	1	*	Yup not the norm, but not unheard of and I wouldn't actually say all that rare. It was additional at my last job also (a local authority).

t1_dsdsmi2	0	*	Why were they escorted out?
t1_dsnzwth	0	*	Thats why I put the Heller decision first, merely saying the statement no one is wanting to take away your guns is objectively false...
t1_dsoqrxg	0	*	Ah that makes sense. Would an elevator be too much of an ask then? At least at one spot? 
t1_dsor866	1	*	You're giving yourself two options.  Life and people are more complicated then that.

t1_dsny3a7	1	*	You do realise Khan has no power to stop muslims coming into London if he wanted to? There isn't a border around London you melon. 
t1_dso8zty	1	*	I think the Articles of Confederation (early US constitution for a few years before ratification of current one) said something about being free to travel, so I think that's where they get the idea. 
t1_dsnz8ia	0	*	Are you really so stupid that you think Sadiq Khan controls immigration into London?    Jesus Christ.

t1_dsnxash	0	*	Happy to share, it's something I truly enjoy.  It's like if a bunch of dudes just decided they could turn invisible and started trying to rob banks, it's awesome.
t1_dv6r23m	0	*	That is pretty well said. You're right, they aren't the same. The Albertan in me gets a little defensive when the topic of nationalizing our petroleum resources comes up. My bad. 
t1_dtehlhb	1	*	And 'Ah, but what about serial killers isn't'?  Whataboutism seems to be a big boogyman for you guys.

t1_dtf6o40	1	*	Because youre wrong 
t1_du5355z	0	*	If your goal is to topple NK, tell me how you will do it without bombing and killing them enmass. That's our military doctrine. We bomb them first. Then we move in. 
t1_du4o44w	1	*	What..? Who exactly are you addressing this incoherent babbling to? 
t1_du5e6d1	0	*	I am under the impression that all NK are communists (not necessary by choice of course), or else they live in the concentration camps. 
t1_du5bncb	0	*	You have to draw the line somewhere, don't you? Can you imagine if Reagan had a massive military parade?
t1_dsxdtei	1	*	...and eat them.   Problem solved. 
t1_dsx65ig	1	*	Crows before... does?  Did I do it right?
t1_dsx6lah	1	*	I think of it almost like a Monty Python movie. Both witty and ridiculous. Know going in that it aims for absurdity. 
t1_dsx88to	1	*	It's not subjective. No habitable earth - no humans. Pretty clear cut.
t1_dsf1u6e	1	*	Because they won't need to be replaced in the same way Apple batteries do.
t1_duxndr4	1	*	Indeed, but it has little to do with linguistic differences, as it is much more related to personal abilities.
t1_dv43lfl	0	*	>reminding the Senate that they were absolutely powerless  It's treason then.
t1_dv3xj2u	0	*	Sounds crazy but less incompetent than our current stable genius
t1_duumwmp	1	*	Wait, you can use gas to kill people? Interesting...
t1_duu4tsl	0	*	Giving a spoiled child a taste of their own medicine teaches them why their behaviour was wrong in the first place. 
t1_dv4pvqr	0	*	I understand they'd be hard to build in an overbuilt area, but not including that kind of infrastructure when building new roads is just silly
t1_dur740i	0	*	My country hasn't had a school shooting since 2002 in which two people were. Your wants come at the expense of children's lives
t1_ds9hfco	1	*	Illegal *gay atheist Muslim* immigrants, get it right!
t1_ds6hekb	0	*	Your professors are fucking retarded then. A friend of mine tried getting off of them and it nearly killed him. He asked a doctor what he could do and he essentially laughed at him.
t1_ds2ur7m	1	*	When nobody has even smirked at them outside of 9gag in over five years.
t1_ds2oeqa	0	*	Try working on your English instead of insulting people, pretty sure nobody understood what you meant.
t1_duiprjq	1	*	It is pretty hard to imagine an United States without gun ownership, the country is absolutely lousy with guns.
t1_dsn8pr1	1	*	Not in my preferred society. A leopard doesn't change its spots. 
t1_dtfc6ot	1	*	Ahh, so he was, thanks for correcting me.
t1_dt3nnpl	1	*	No I don't but I don't mind the guy.
t1_dt3976r	1	*	Youre underestimating Satans piss
t1_dt3r3eu	1	*	Sounds like a really bad excuse to be honest.
t1_dt3mojq	0	*	If they can endure 2 weeks in a boat to reach Australia they probably can endure 4 to reach Canada.
t1_dt4wund	1	*	Poor immigrants just tend to locate in poor neighborhoods, they don't turn it that way. The fact is that immigration is a net economic gain for both countries. 
t1_dt46fld	1	*	Free movement of citizens of the EU which they are not so that does not apply. It would have been a very good point tho so I get why you bring it up. 
t1_dt3c9ki	0	*	Roses are red, violets are blue, Israel is disgusting and so are you. 
t1_dt60gph	1	*	You said he wouldn't get a response. He got plenty of responses.
t1_dt5n57u	0	*	Ahh, right, so we should stop white people being born because of the IRA... Right? Otherwise you are just being xenophobic.
t1_dt3mo3j	1	*	Which is the epitome of fuck you, got mine
t1_dt3euqu	0	*	I'm not saying that at all.  I'm say comparing Israel's necessary security situation with Nazi Germany is absurdly ignorant at best, and motivated by racial animus at worst.
t1_ds72zyj	0	*	>borderline abusive  Lol okay. Words arent fists.  Id let them exercise their rights.
t1_dsb6iwi	0	*	Hahahahaha, imagine being this clueless but still willing to talk with such gusto and confidence on a subject.
t1_ds6ss75	1	*	Well, thanks for warning the rest of us so we know not to ever move there!
t1_ds6dv5f	1	*	I mean I totally understand where Germany is coming from too.   *shrugs* I try to crush these hateful ideals with education personally but I'm not going to tell Germans how to live their lives. 
t1_ds6emrs	0	*	Actually I trade bonds while keeping a /pol/ tab open at all times, I need the cynicism
t1_ds6qdw9	0	*	>I mean, it's extremely clear they didn't read it considering the article is about Chechnya but people are acting like it's local US politics.
t1_ds6hh9t	1	*	Ok.
t1_ds7bvit	1	*	.....and they say it was a grammatical offense
t1_ds75204	1	*	Not really left leaning. I mean most support capitalism, private prisons etc.  I'd say most democrats and republicans are center-right/right wing.
t1_ds6g4r3	0	*	Would you stand by that if the Internet for example was 100% privately owned and controlled yet as wide spread as it is today?    But it's PRIVATE 
t1_ds6e9qq	0	*	''that's where ur wrong kiddo''      -enlightened centrists
t1_ds6f0nj	0	*	I believe the site consensus is that traps are gay. You can still be rightwing and like traps though, I see it all the time over there. Historically, even the SA was full of homosexuals.

t1_du9mcra	0	*	No, she was purposely instigating a response for propaganda purposes.  
t1_dtzu3w3	0	*	It is relevant because of tax breaks. In practice, the US indirectly pays for foreign aid even though it isn't recorded as such
t1_dtw7n4x	1	*	Not according to the original comment you replied to..
t1_dtvxmve	0	*	Sounds like not joining has the benefit of not promising unknown but substantial amounts of money to be dumped into a black hole.
t1_dtvddqx	1	*	>Democrats could have voted on DACA literally any time on its own. They CHOSE to use it as a hostage for budget negotiations.  
t1_dtvq9z9	0	*	EU been around its current form for 12 years before it started to break apart. I honestly feel bad for how dedicated they are to a failing enterprise. 
t1_dtw0piw	0	*	How does that mean the US has absolutely 0 role in the world? It doesn't imply that at all
t1_dsapbat	0	*	It was a joke, bad intelligence does happen though. The U.S. would never hit a legitimate hospital. 
t1_dtno0yq	1	*	So what you're saying is you're incapable of sourcing your argument?  By that same logic, Scotland funds the English NHS because we send money to Westminster via our oil money that gets taken from us.
t1_dsxftzq	0	*	>I simply asked a question. Why are republicans not simply releasing the memo?  Uh, perhaps because it needs to be de classified, and Congress cannot unilaterally do that?
t1_dtqnljl	1	*	Religion is the single reason for most if not all issues in the middle east right now.  The fact that we are still having holy wars IE ISIS thousand years later is ridiculous.
t1_dt2x3lo	0	*	That statement isn't even true on its face, I'm not the one missing the point here.
t1_dudk0fn	1	*	Well, unfortunately, the laws of physics prevent us from doing that, so doom it is.
t1_dteutrb	0	*	Refugees can enter illegally and still apply for asylum once there without legal repercussion.  So all Canada is saying is that only come here illegally when you have a good claim for asylum.
t1_dsc174s	1	*	Good bit of sabaton never goes amiss
t1_dscg179	1	*	No, but you can bomb where their supply lines originate from in North Vietnam.
t1_dsc1522	1	*	Leaks are done for a reason.  When you're plotting a nuclear re-shuffle of civilization, you *kill* any potential leaks.  This isn't Trump politics we're talking about, this is the adults
t1_dsbxtzj	0	*	The Soviet Union would have invaded.... Their goal was worldwide communism. It wasn't some misunderstanding that got blown out of proportion. If they could have done it they would have. 
t1_dsc38cc	0	*	Exactly.
t1_dscesw0	1	*	No, but you can kill their families.
t1_dsbr0r6	1	*	lol no your taxes just subsidize low wages from places like Walmart and pay for the presidents golf trips

t1_dsc4kb7	1	*	Its not.
t1_dsw40ft	0	*	I'm not a republican, I'm an independent.  It's not worth my time to address anything else you said there because you have no idea how difficult it is to run a large organization.
t1_dscgsxm	1	*	Home manufacturing is converted to wartime manufacturing. That's how Japan got rich as a war supply depot got US during Korean war, help tremendously the industrialization process for Japan.

t1_dsc2y60	0	*	But what if china exports a shit ton of stuff to Russia and their economy booms because of it
t1_dscl7zl	1	*	Legal obligation, no; geopolitical interest, yes. Which is why I said while everyone else is preoccupied.
t1_dsckkf8	1	*	Also the GDP of New York City
t1_dsbur5i	0	*	Trump is Putin's bitch...
t1_dsc7w4r	1	*	The USA does the war economy thing pretty well.  The problem is a really big pop-off isn't going to go like WWII, where we had a few years to spin up heavy industry.
t1_dsca297	1	*	North was already winning by that point.
t1_dsc1bw3	0	*	If you can't tell by reading your own post, then you probably wouldn't be much help ;)
t1_dsc2fzp	0	*	> Both were about to join NATO. Seeing a pattern?  the pattern being, if a country doesnt want to be Russia's little friend anymore, Russia has the authority to invade and kill its people?

t1_dv04tbc	1	*	I heard that South Africa's constitution is fairly strong. Is it possible that the judicial system will challenge this move?
t1_dv005ck	1	*	You can't misuse language, lmao.    But you can indeed misrepresent the common usage of certain vocabulary.

t1_dv1igyq	0	*	Trotting, jogging, and skipping, aren't walking. I'm not sure how it's that hard to understand.   No, reverse racism is a separate word. 
t1_dv0ushw	1	*	Just for the record, I'm a white guy who can accept his privilege in this world. And maybe take 10 minutes to see how institutional racism affects minorities in the Global North. 
t1_dv041dl	1	*	I agree with you. They are NOT in the tourism business, so they probably would not care too much if tourism stopped alltogether. 
t1_dv19yh6	1	*	Christianity isn't a race.
t1_dv0bdvw	1	*	Country size isn't particularly relevant here to be honest. How many refugees attempt to gain entry vs how many are denied is a much better metric.

t1_dv148j7	0	*	If that is the case I think you'd understand the necessity for nuance regarding heavy subjects.

t1_dv04k23	1	*	Ok I concede, its been a few months since I got out of my refugee studies/anthropology course, and I certainly don't know everything about this, just that I know there is a difference.

t1_dt8huo2	0	*	That wasn't my statement I'm not op. I'm just saying if you really cared you'd google it yourself, but you just wanna be a smartass and feel that you are better than everybody else.
t1_du7p9n2	0	*	It was due to an extremely brutal regime that seeks and destroys anyone who doesnt conform. Cuba is the Caribbeans version of North Korea.

t1_ds15kko	0	*	I blame Bush.   No, really. Around the time they were talkin' about invading Iraq they also kicked NK out of the NPT.   Immediately thereafter, they succeeded in developing nukes.   gee, thanks bush.

t1_ds15vfw	0	*	You seem to be knowledgeable about this stuff. Thanks, very interesting.   I had never heard of defense systems being treated as a threat.
t1_ds1593u	1	*	*Every* paper is biased. Inherently, all sources are in terms of news and the like. That said, this: >WashPo writers should burn in hell  Is pretty ridiculous to say about them.
t1_dsdvmsf	1	*	My bad, I somehow conflated your comment which I agree with and the person you were responding to.   
t1_dseep4s	0	*	Al Jazeera is another institutional channel that can have a place in a proper news diet. Not less biased than the others, but differently. And that's interesting.
t1_du2myuj	0	*	I think it's more from Government debt. Which was the method Taiwan used. You can't really squeeze much money using taxes when everyone's poor.
t1_du1rhmt	0	*	No one fears communists. They're failures.  What is feared is authoritarian governments slaughtering unarmed people. But keep on lying to push your 'charm offensive'.
t1_du1u503	1	*	Sure, same for North Korea. Same for many western nations 40 years back. 
t1_du1wlc5	1	*	Spot on, we've backed plenty of despots because it served our interest and frankly if the USA's constant foreign assassination and coup campaigns aren't scary and authoritarian I don't know what is.
t1_dsu4vhp	1	*	Hah!   Yeah, I'm still around.
t1_dsbhj70	0	*	Then how about you show sources proving these once a week incidents?
t1_duymz2v	1	*	propagation of lies as fact and/or selective reporting of truth to shape a public opinion that fits your agenda. Western media relies heavily on the latter part.

t1_dsyeb4v	0	*	See the link I already posted.
t1_dtx26c0	1	*	>And they shouldn't have that. No good will come from mixing corporations with politics.  Unfortunately in most countries those two are inseparable with each other.
t1_dv3isbd	1	*	Yeah, but that got swept under the rug pretty quickly. 
t1_ducm2tf	1	*	I think you mean Russian speakers, and also going to war shouldn't be a celebrated affair (when you go to war, people die).
t1_dsqzztz	1	*	*come. 
t1_dsrar59	0	*	Yeah, but not all id that is valid inside is valid internationally. My driver's license is valid id at home, but not in other EU countries.

t1_dttqej0	0	*	That literally doesn't sound real.

t1_dtp061t	0	*	The part at least I am having problems with is 'rightfully part of its territory'. That is - in my humble view - very different than 'feels threatened', no?
t1_dtojyvo	0	*	Yeah?   I never claimed that they didn't.  
t1_dto6zv6	1	*	So you think we should let ISIS run amok and kill and enslave millions? Personally I'm for complete annihilation.

t1_dto99jz	1	*	Somebody's gotta tend to the water buffalo. 
t1_dto8vm0	1	*	portray not betray. Also, do you not think your government wants you to be overly positive of the troops? That's why they can get away with not providing free healthcare and education
t1_du8zst1	1	*	I understand, and I agree. It's like small town politics. Hard to convict the Judge when the Sheriff is on the take.
t1_du9mh3w	1	*	I agree
t1_du847n5	0	*	Or being very selfish by not considering what others may go through, it may be ok for him.
t1_du8dj6p	0	*	My problem is with selfish cunts, rich or poor. The problems we all face are because of that mentality. Its so simple and relevant that it whizzes straight over your head. Good luck with that.
t1_du8h3i6	0	*	Did you just attempt a won't someone think of the elderly argument?
t1_dub2zki	1	*	Um, a quarter of a year is also 3 months or 13 weeks.
t1_du9l6df	0	*	I'm not counting the capital investment, that can be recouped from profits minus tax. 
t1_du87jj6	0	*	Yeah it's pretty great.  This is where you make that old, fallacious argument about taxes. Even though, on a cost analysis basis, it is essentially free for me.
t1_du83hke	1	*	Sure, but if the loophole is due to loose capital control, then it's a capital control issue, and the conversation should be about that. 
t1_du8cqbg	1	*	I propose a society where we have no paper money and everyone lives off positive vibes and happy thoughts.
t1_dur0d55	1	*	That's why the use of glasses/contact lenses has sky rocketed in the past decade.
t1_durne5b	1	*	That's not in dispute. 
t1_duq5a02	0	*	Only to a 14 year old Trump supporting American. To the rest of the world much less so.
t1_duqrcgn	1	*	Yeah.  I'm just gonna remember I don't want to think about it.
t1_dv34ffl	1	*	I live in rural southeast Georgia. I agree with you. I want my vote to matter again. My vote shouldnt mean nothing just because of the morons around me. 
t1_dv2tlkb	0	*	This uncle has never driven through the American Midwest. Especially Kansas. Fuck Kansas. Barely a rolling hill to look at as far as the eye can see.
t1_dv31iz5	1	*	lol comeback to what? he didn't say anything
t1_dv2whpz	0	*	I grew up in a town of 5,000 people. They were almost all highly educated. There's a stupid stereotype that anyone from a small town is an ignorant, racist, xenophobic hick and that is just wrong.

t1_dv2roqg	1	*	You shouldn't skip doses on your meds, the paranoia acts up.
t1_dv2qn4l	1	*	Ugh our household income is 6 figures and im 32. My mortgage is only 700 a month. No kids. I feel rich. Also rich white male was a joke... people assume if you are a white male you are rich...

t1_dv2sywm	0	*	I moved to Abbotsford BC from southwestern Ontario and decided to drive it in 5 days mid summer... 12 hours a day driving is brutal in 32xb0 weather and no A/C

t1_dtuda2u	0	*	It doesnt even make everyone less productive. It makes me _more_ productive.

t1_dv59pss	1	*	 I made   Agreed YOU were moving the goal posts not me.
t1_dtjukil	0	*	Killing people who are occupying your land by force and defending against people stealing your property is a moral obligation to any occupied population.  It has nothing to do with being Jewish. 
t1_dtj0j0s	0	*	Israeli jews
t1_duw617e	1	*	It's working well here in Texas, honestly a lot of people here are all about renewable energy especially solar. It might not be for climate reasons but that just shows how good solar has gotten.
t1_duvwwhr	0	*	Forbes, BP, and the Worldbank are not credible sources for environmental data
t1_duvzedg	1	*	Following your analogy, I don't think we as a species will do anything about it until our first cardiac arrest.

t1_duw0qd0	1	*	>  Its the equivalent of getting mad because your doctor tells you to stop smoking 2 packs a day and stop eating yourself into extreme obesity.  You know what? That would make most people mad.
t1_duy5hom	0	*	Well, that's good that you don't deny it's happening. I must ask again, though: What would convince you that climate change is primarily man-made?
t1_duw3el5	1	*	Australias years behind as well. Im not talking shit about America because I hate them, because my own country s fucking itself as well.
t1_duwn1nj	1	*	This, and sadly the majority of America  is too dumb/media washed to think critically anymore.
t1_duwgvil	0	*	I wonder what is the source of those greenhouse emissions for solar...
t1_duw3nky	0	*	If you want to talk about greenhouse gases you'll find China emitting less than half of the US per capita at the moment.

t1_dsfto7w	0	*	Which zone is worse then? 
t1_duuf1jz	1	*	The business model only wasn't viable because it doesnt factor in long-term consequences.

t1_duw00kb	0	*	What about the water?
t1_duua4je	1	*	While that may be a possibility, and I don't begrudge the idea, I think the danger is falling into the trap of thinking you're right, when everyone else may need you to be part of a solution.

t1_dutzz0g	0	*	Why not? Letting the masses vote ended up with a grossly inadequate tv star leading America. A Meritocratic leader is working very well for China.

t1_dt2mde9	1	*	Maybe
t1_dtg8lph	0	*	You're reallyyyy bad at pretending to be a democrat, and if you actually think Obama is to blame for the state of the Democratic Party you simply haven't been paying attention.

t1_dufs1kp	1	*	Getting offended by a bad joke on a Reddit thread. Go on.
t1_dug0bay	1	*	Nailed it. Atlanta and Los Angeles is where I saw this the most. The white ladies just don't get pulled over as much and if they do, they are more likely to get a pass. 
t1_dug73mh	1	*	It's a Saturday, they're off.
t1_dugoe58	1	*	I'm going to chime in to agree with the other commenters here, you should go back and reread that comment. He is saying that all age groups are just as likely to text and drive.

t1_dtbmgs5	1	*	The NCAA is a hive of evil with Jerry Sandusky then?
t1_dtbs1s2	0	*	So when your dog shits on your floor, rather than desiring the dog not shit on my floor, i should in fact be happy with the shit on my floor and ask for more? Nah. If its a problem, i dont want it.
t1_dswdhjp	1	*	So the thought process behind the communist witch hunt so many decades ago is still alive and well but has no teeth and is now harmlessly lurking in the shadows of social media.
t1_dsoejvp	1	*	the growth of jobs under trump is lower than the last 5 years of Obama

t1_dsq8kw7	0	*	Obama was still President the day after the election. He would still be President for two and a half more months.
t1_dsnwqmr	0	*	So the only legitimate reason to dislike a politician is that they've  personally hurt you? Strangely, I think that if they hurt society as a whole, that is a pretty good reason to oppose them. 
t1_duyg1c1	1	*	I think your non-existent grasp of math and science is hilarious 
t1_du284gj	1	*	Stupider version also.
t1_du2dvea	0	*	It's not an all-encompassing definition (there are other facets), but being pedantic without a purpose is a good start.

t1_dspwuwb	1	*	Exactly. 
t1_dspkxmd	1	*	...It's also a dance club and a song.   I'm assuming he meant it as some other tragic video/event, not just a meme that he'll always remember.

t1_dudyk18	1	*	cool, just so long as you get my point
t1_du3v6y9	1	*	I wouldn't use it as a primary source, but maybe as pointers to investigate some events further. It's clearly part of an agenda, regardless of the intention behind it. 
t1_dv46ncl	0	*	Oh. No luck with them swans then?

t1_dt2lwmq	0	*	My point is that anonymous sources are nothing new. It's a foundation of how journalism has worked for ages.
t1_dulo1wh	1	*	I also suggested that the payment comes from another source other than the tax payer coffers. Maybe their pension fund. 
t1_dsaak6c	0	*	Palestine should never have had to 'accept or reject' any plan. Israel should never had been settled.  I'm saying this as a Brit. We settled Jews there after WW2 and it shouldn't have happened.
t1_ds9y9di	1	*	So migrants can go back to their own bedroom if they don't like Germany's.
t1_dsbcsdr	1	*	But the current state of Israel requires that Palestine be occupied. 
t1_dsa7r46	1	*	Ah. Now I understand.
t1_dsa74ts	1	*	Inciting violence is not an opinion and thus not speech. Watch the video I linked that no one at all in these comments seems to be watching even though they all clearly love it or hate it.
t1_dsb0qlq	1	*	no, it does not mean that. Anti-zionist may include people who refuse that the state of Israel in its current form but would not mind it in another form (binational state / federation ...)

t1_dtnd05l	0	*	OK; that covers driving part; what about the rest?   As to the hijabs, I don't think it's the US that is arresting women for taking them off.
t1_dtnv99x	0	*	Makes sense. Thanks for the examples.
t1_dtnd8za	0	*	Exactly... It's ok as long as it's what you agree with. It's hypocritical.

t1_dtin9lk	1	*	Even though private for-profit prisons are fucking disgraceful, I'm pretty sure only like 8 percent of all US prisons are private.
t1_dtih21t	1	*	Reagan Presidency was innocent? He created this mess, if it wasn't for Reagan there was no Trump
t1_dtikc8b	0	*	Using random Americans is a bit misleading and dismissive, dont you think? A lot of these problems are regional, so skewing numbers for the entire us population seems disingenuous. 
t1_dtjyrni	0	*	If you don't want to pay US taxes, then leave the United States and renounce your citizenship. If you choose to stay here, then you are agreeing to pay the price.

t1_dtik77j	1	*	Give me a call before you cash the checks, I will need to move some money around. 
t1_dtihgbt	1	*	People have performed self-immolation. What's your point? Just because somebody willingly does something they know will end in no way means they could suffer it knowing no end is in sight.
t1_dtj0cb6	1	*	It took you 2 years to get to this point? Sounds like someone's been procrastinating 
t1_dtiwv9f	0	*	I'm not a fan of any political party, group, or persons.

t1_dt98thi	1	*	So you're also arguing for decriminalization instead of legalization, the exact thing I'm arguing for right?
t1_dt7ltb6	0	*	Same here. My only chemical vice is caffiene, I am also curious about your sources.
t1_dti88hv	0	*	That's the problem with such common knowledge, nobody takes a critical look to see if the statement is true. Alas, you are right, such discussions cannot be held in heated threads.
t1_dssxqch	1	*	It's ok, it's cold where you live.
t1_dv3eys9	1	*	It doesn't refute anything, mate. It's still there in black and white. Lol 
t1_dsgqihh	1	*	Well I guess for me I know someone who grows really good stuff and it's about half the price of anything at a dispensary. With how much I smoke it's definitely worth buying it illegally.

t1_ds1ixps	1	*	Like anyone cares what a trump supporters opinion of them is. 
t1_ds4dzth	1	*	Willfull ignorance my friend
t1_ds1fe63	0	*	And that was the best decision ever. I don't want to get lynched for eating a beef steak like in India, or just lynched straight for being Muslim like in 2002. 
t1_ds1fbef	1	*	We'll get over it
t1_ds1gqed	0	*	By being a black man.
t1_ds20uuu	0	*	So it was politically motivated glad u agree.
t1_ds5hd94	1	*	Mastermind? Alright, I would have used the word pawn but go ahead and twist my words into whatever you'd like
t1_ds2eeln	1	*	Except for the higher hips in the military responding with resounding 'WTF's and refusing to do it
t1_ds1hb1m	0	*	Thank you for bringing me the latest news from 1997
t1_ds1qmlw	1	*	China is in the business of becoming the #1 super power. 
t1_ds1fa8r	0	*	The goal was the oil after all. The opium was just a side gig, the CIA got bored of smuggling tons of cocaine so they decided to move onto harder drugs.
t1_ds1owti	1	*	Poor guy probably liked Homefront too.
t1_ds1mppo	1	*	Fentanyl isnt made from opium, and the majority of heroin in the US is grown in South America.
t1_ds5fdh0	0	*	No one is suggesting that the military members involved dont deserve credit.
t1_ds1rxsl	1	*	That's fine alnd shitty no doubt but there are people out there who literally hate other people because they are jealous of their money.
t1_ds1nvcn	0	*	You're the one who said maybe it's going toward some shit it needs to go to, even though you had no proof other than he said he was looking into that. So turn your words on yourself.
t1_ds1iarw	0	*	i was talking about staying about not leaving. Leaving will reverse what i said
t1_ds1y0a4	1	*	Oh, now you bring THAT guy into it.
t1_ds1lds2	0	*	It's irrelevant if it's pre-9/11 or not. He could have taken out an emerging threat to his country and didn't do it.    Clinton even says it's one of his biggest regrets. 
t1_ds33ibi	0	*	Are you talking about the ones that Hillary Clinton paid $500,000?
t1_ds1grmf	1	*	Excellent rebuttal.  You must mod that sub.
t1_ds1lmox	1	*	Old folks were right. Time just flies now.
t1_ds1uzdp	1	*	Just make sure your certitude that it's senseless is in check.
t1_ds1m65z	0	*	 The military usually does most of the actual work lol
t1_ds1m2kq	0	*	No kidding. What can they do? Nukes? Steal Congress' email?
t1_ds1uo8j	1	*	I think you meant to reply to someone else? :)
t1_ds1s1js	1	*	They could nuke any invasion force that we send their way. Starting a nuclear war over what amounts to pocket change for the US would be incredibly stupid
t1_ds1wenq	1	*	But you can buy ten for the price of one and maybe one of those ten will be ok, maybe.
t1_ds1jw8g	1	*	I agree that Iraq wasn't as bad, though it took a heavy hand to keep it peaceful. 
t1_ds2edcd	1	*	Thank goodness
t1_ds1ftxh	0	*	No I did not say that. Only they do not have the tech to reach us. So it is a moot point.
t1_ds1mgek	0	*	> The newly released text messages demonstrated that.  What happened now? Link please
t1_ds1k0or	0	*	You mean Hidan. 
t1_ds1ghf4	0	*	Oh I thought you were saying you would be glad if he invested in infrastructure. I was showing he won't.
t1_ds1md58	1	*	Reality truly is a bitch.  You can't change the past, and you can't just back out of something like this.
t1_ds1kd1s	0	*	You sure seem like an unbiased source of opinions.
t1_ds1y799	1	*	meh
t1_ds1nz7j	1	*	That impacts us man....   Iran is a quasi terror state them ruling the region wouldn't be a good thing. Iran controlling the middle east would be a major boon to global terrorism.
t1_ds1ilnc	0	*	Your hate is so pathetic.
t1_dtqb3hf	1	*	Because their asylum applications get denied.
t1_dtq2qfl	0	*	Worked out fine for us here in America.   Source: Am son of a refugee. 
t1_dtqzz12	0	*	That is a false presumption. There is no inherent social contract that suggests this unless the citizens wish it to be so.
t1_du2kvwa	0	*	You can deny as much as you like, if you think Israel is the only country in the region not interfering in Syria, then you can believe whatever you want. Just medical aid! How precious. 
t1_du0yanu	1	*	Both of you are right actually
t1_du1c4b9	0	*	I suggest you strive to have higher ambitions than being a Russian or Chinese sattelite state.
t1_dtq678z	1	*	Replying to you doesn't necessarily mean I'm talking exclusively to you, fwiw.
t1_dtqftcf	0	*	I think thats what i said  I dont know what a canary is
t1_dtpkhq7	0	*	That's sort of how the supreme court works... being the highest court in the land, their decisions are the ones that matter. What a lower court previously thought is irrelevant.
t1_dtqyyxf	1	*	That doesn't change what classifies somebody as a criminal.
t1_dsnakun	1	*	Oh my Allah, praise be to he, I lol'd so hard when I read that
t1_dsn1uyc	1	*	The question was statistics of hoaxes VS non-hoaxes  not more hoax examples. 
t1_dstpylz	1	*	None of them are.
t1_dsmnp4u	1	*	You're done because you've been outmatched. Typical.
t1_dsnpxaw	1	*	In this case they are in fact 'often' relative to other crime hoax rates (in my experience).
t1_dsno1ls	0	*	How do you show that Muslims weren't discriminated against? Doesn't your objective logic show that you can't prove a negative?
t1_duwqyfn	0	*	Who occupies the South exactly?
t1_duub81g	1	*	True but they are when you have every election rigged. 
t1_du2yyvj	0	*	Hard to tell if you're making a joke or not.  That's a wildly inaccurate comparison, but this is Reddit, where people say weird shit all the time.
t1_du2zs6l	1	*	> in every flight ~~that's ever crashed,~~ there's been someone on board who was afraid of flying/crashing.       There are always some aboard.  
t1_du3el63	0	*	Yes it is. Don't get in an accident. There are many things you can to do prevent this.
t1_du33lk4	1	*	Not exactly true for a Tesla driver using autopilot.
t1_du36m43	0	*	It was unsecured cargo shifting right? He's talking about that plane that's taking off then appears to just stop and drop out of the sky, no?
t1_du51pyu	1	*	Well said.
t1_du30eu3	1	*	Dont be an idiot. Thats xenaphobic. Xenophobic is hatred of those godless heathen xenomorphs. Obv
t1_du319ag	0	*	Was anything done about this?  I've known about this, but reading the details is gut-wrenching.
t1_du31dn0	1	*	Well, someone could potentially resuscitate you back to life.
t1_du4dhfh	0	*	Good question.  Doesn't Russia kinda hate Israel though?  Or at least, they aren't allies?  I wouldn't be surprised if Russia was behind the Iranian plane being flown there.  
t1_du39ys0	1	*	Woah lad, not sure we should go round just whimsically swearing on ye nan's grave
t1_du3b6we	1	*	Try to keep in mind that most airplanes have back-up equipment systems and or fail safe. Obviously, it doesnt always prevent an accident but its there.
t1_du3384b	0	*	Phrase it better next time then. TIL RUSSIANS ARE PEOPLE TOO
t1_du3zezf	1	*	I'll get you next time!
t1_du368ve	0	*	you should do the same to avoid a rear end too. I leave enough room whenever possible for me to move if the car behind me doesn't stop. 
t1_du35zvd	0	*	Looks like you got your feelings hurt by the truth.  There there.
t1_du38jg7	0	*	Its usually much darker, but keeping it pretty tame for Reddit lol
t1_dttzs5n	1	*	Aww thank you
t1_dtfu7fp	0	*	if theres no signs then it cant be trespassing. Its only trespassing idf you are asked to leave and then you refuse. Just walking/driving onto private property isnt trespassing.
t1_dt5dya4	0	*	Okay, that's not true either.   Democrats don't want to kick out hardworking, peaceful contributing members of society because that is batshit insane and evil. 
t1_dt9w7xh	0	*	> https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subspecies  Doesn't work for humans now does it
t1_dt4y6dk	0	*	When you find it, please locate statistics on who pays for their tuition too.  I would be thrilled to find out that they are responsible for the same or more college debt, rather than scholarship.
t1_dt5mhwa	0	*	Redefine their status so their legality is not ambiguous.  Coulda been done already.  Wasn't because standing up for dreamers is a political rabbit out of a hat.
t1_dt66yz7	0	*	Wrong
t1_dsvml6q	1	*	Yeah I agree, that is why Repub are making it hard. The risk/reward of statehood isn't worth it, so we hope they just get sick of it and go independent. 
t1_ds4qalx	1	*	O snap. The immovable force versus the immovable object folks.
t1_duph6zy	1	*	I have morals the only thing I think you have is what gun to choose that's bit lame and evil  sorry bro  you need doc more than me 
t1_dsdxx0p	1	*	We certainly dont agree, no. 
t1_dsdqx94	0	*	No, I just don't feel like rehashing settled law from early 2017. You're the one who's a day late and a dollar short.
t1_ds22jqr	1	*	Way to prove how shit and heartless people are in the face of israels attempt at a reich 
t1_dukxc9c	1	*	Im sorry but what does wine have to do with the Russians
t1_duky1jw	0	*	Fascism is not the opposite of communism. It's the opposite of anarchy. 
t1_dsn5sje	1	*	Super constructive back and forth here guys
t1_dtp2civ	0	*	And theyve been coming into her town which isnt Israeli land for years. 
t1_dta2gzn	1	*	???
t1_dtbged1	0	*	So you think any time someone is charged with something like disorderly conduct, resisting arrest, interfering with a PO or obstruction of justice it means the police officer is looking for revenge? 
t1_dta5k9c	1	*	Well Berlin police were certainly let themselves loose haha  To those unaware there was quite a bit of less professional conduct such public sex and stripping while carrying a service weapon.
t1_dta85vc	0	*	Well, good for you then. Takes a strong person to admit to and learn from a fuckup.
t1_dtb12m3	0	*	Bit racists don't you think? Assuming my race based on my ideas? Assuming black people need to fit a certain stereo type otherwise they aren't black. 
t1_dtaoygy	0	*	Naw. This lady is pretty much the textbook definition of she when used correctly. Same with Melissa Click. It's definition is recorded. Your definition is how it's missed and missaplied by idiots.
t1_dtab03q	0	*	Defense of what?  The flags look brand new and not what you'd expect from people associating with it. 
t1_dta4vr3	1	*	ironic, since these laws were written by the allies in the de-nazification of germany. go open a history book sometime. the german merely continued the usage of these anti-nazi laws. 
t1_dtaonpr	1	*	And without Grog from Dhrbdhd you'd still be saying ooo ooo OOO. What's your point?
t1_dtaeqc5	1	*	Are you telling me that imagination *isn't* more important than knowledge??
t1_dtafaxj	1	*	I'm just mad about my deodorant.
t1_dtalk0i	1	*	The same time Half Life 3 comes out.
t1_dtanmtm	0	*	What a load of post war, Cold War propaganda. I dont live in Europe 
t1_dtb18lh	1	*	Are you trying to miss the context or is that unintentional?
t1_dtabdgp	0	*	Ive had the complete opposite experience as a conservative. :) 
t1_dtbq6ao	1	*	A dictionary from which country? See we go full circle.
t1_dtc8fl4	1	*	Yeah, I think it is time we get out of Europe.  Putin seems like a nice fellow and we can use the money here at home.
t1_dtar2zn	1	*	We have to turn this into a story about how Americans are terrible. Just one doesn't cut it.
t1_dtbs2n2	1	*	Let's be clear. I am making a good point. Security theater has zero value. It's a waste of time, money, etc. that greatly decreases safety. 
t1_dtbw3xn	1	*	Didn't realize you can't buy deodorant anymore
t1_dtaodlo	0	*	Because Santa Monica is beautiful and fashionable, except for all the hobos and bangers.  And the poorer places, the pier, etc provide culture and enrichment.
t1_dtaddti	1	*	Ye's!
t1_dtaot6f	0	*	What, 6 million misspelled words tossed in an oven?
t1_dt9z0qu	1	*	Dude, you are being such a nazi right now its unbelievable 
t1_dta39ln	1	*	Still entirely irrelevant to my only point: you are legally protected to insult cops in the US. The fuck outta here with your red herrings.
t1_dtak065	1	*	Oh, so you're saying if anyone disagrees, it is a violation of free speech?
t1_dtao2sy	1	*	Congrats, you're located in Washington D.C.  It's still not a T1 school. 
t1_dta5dnt	1	*	Mah Nazi! How you doin?
t1_dta0q95	1	*	I would still plumb for people I hated. The pipes look the same and I get their money.
t1_dta5lbh	0	*	It's more that we don't have a law against it in the US but there is a law against it in Germany. The very nature of having said laws is authoritarian and reminds people of  guess who HITLER.
t1_dtckmjs	1	*	All those caps look angry. 
t1_dta7z8l	1	*	(xb4uff40)
t1_dt9yuqd	1	*	LOL, I can't even. Is stereotyping a hobby for you??
t1_dtafjn6	1	*	Oh okay that makes sense.  
t1_dtazoe7	1	*	So you're saying she's a nazi?
t1_dtchi59	1	*	The Gorilla channel is the shit, don't make fun of it if you had access to it you'd watch it 17 hours a day as well. 
t1_dtb0j7w	1	*	US has better freedom of speech and of the press.
t1_dta36m3	1	*	That's one, I havnt seen anything besides that
t1_dta00b3	1	*	Similarly, whose fault is it that a person from Australia can be called an Aussie? Because that one definitely confused me as a child.
t1_dtaakgc	1	*	You're right, tuition for me is 306 per semester and about half of that is a ticket for all public transportation in Berlin and parts of Brandenburg.
t1_dszm34f	0	*	I'm fucking weak bruh. What possessed him to do that? How rich is he that he could just drop money on a trip without any planning?
t1_dsztlbh	1	*	I do this every day. I love to travel but it's expensive and I have a young family so Google street view is the next best thing!
t1_dt1ksn3	0	*	I, ironically enough, will be getting smashed while eating sushi this Friday, but it's because its an official company sponsored new years party, so its a bit fancier then a night out with the guys.
t1_dszpfbf	0	*	True, but Otaku in the U.S. is a positive descriptor.
t1_dtfjxun	1	*	> Japan refuses to take in immigrants like other major countries  #  >This has nothing to do with the conversation  Hmmm
t1_dszruiu	0	*	No it didn't mention abortion at all. Nor stds nor birth control. Must have been a different video 
t1_dup2szp	1	*	But 50 years after that you couldnt say theyre 50 years behind the west, when much of the West was the same.
t1_du67gqv	0	*	I think you are mixing me up with the other poster.
t1_dshp56e	0	*	Being that it's nigh impossible to prove the lack of, how about you provide evidence to the existence of a Palestinian identity prior instead?  As for stealing ottoman territory, open a history book. 
t1_dshbc0g	0	*	That international law is pretty useless 
t1_dsbs8w4	1	*	Holy straw man 
t1_dv4zzf2	0	*	Have any source proving the opposite?
t1_dumr17r	1	*	Show me the stats then. I dont see the same numbers. Also, NRA blocks studies of gun violence.
t1_ds1qj9d	0	*	None. She was used in hostilities though.
t1_ds23ynw	0	*	That's really gross, but it still doesn't make an UNARMED CIVILIAN CHILD a soldier, regardless of whether they are a Palestinian or Israeli.
t1_dsvo86l	0	*	Great argument. You are a pretty good troll I have to hand it to you.
t1_du8jcma	0	*	Thing is technology changed. We can deal with the cold and we have much more efficient food sources. 
t1_dsdo3hn	0	*	Wikileaks has a lot of enemies, surely one of them would have posted something they got wrong. Can you please link me to that, I'd love to see it.
t1_duaohq1	0	*	Sources that people *allege* various things? Of course. Sources that show that said allegations *actually happened*, no. 
t1_dua76no	0	*	Well I would then argue that the 1500s was also an open society yet we do nothing about it. How do we decide when 'open society' started? It's totally arbitrary
t1_duqcf15	0	*	Really? Cuz Brazil and Mexico have seen deaths skyrocket despite practical gun bans.
t1_duqrxsz	1	*	Lmao. It's okay, you pulled some facts out of your ass and when asked to present the evidence, you found the easiest way out. This is reddit so i'm not surprised. 
t1_duqh2bg	1	*	oh man, you just blew my mind a little bit.
t1_duqqqil	1	*	Glad you agree. 
t1_duqftrn	1	*	Pretty much right on all counts, but I think it's worth noting that Democrats have been particularly bad at running basically anything lower than senate campaigns for years now.
t1_duqexr6	0	*	This is the dumbest thing I've ever read
t1_duqcvw2	0	*	I dunno, the last year has had, like, 3 constitutional crises and nothing has happened from it.

t1_duq7no0	1	*	As long as you didn't bang his hoooor wife.
t1_duqggcd	1	*	You do realize that gas prices pretty much affect prices of all the other goods you're consuming, as those have to reach you somehow?
t1_durv7zz	0	*	So Fox News, Breitbart, BBC, Drudge Report, Facebook, CNN, reddit, sculptures, oil paintings, those infographic pamphlets on airlines that tell you what to do in an emergency?
t1_dur9vij	1	*	For some background, FDR tried this in 1937 and it failed. He had very few supporters. Nobody in their right mind wants to do this.
t1_duqf0yo	1	*	They tried. People didnt care. SCOTUS nominations apparently arent sexy enough to capture the popular interest when you have a candidate talking about grabbing them by the pussy.
t1_duqc1lk	0	*	RemindMe! 1 month Good thing I'm a powerful techno wizard.  It's gonna be a weird year for you.
t1_duqmqy5	0	*	The Conservative justices tend to be strict constitutionalists. It tends to be a more dependable philosophy than twisting the Constitution to say what you want.
t1_duqaazx	0	*	> If they thought they could they would have banned guns....  I was told to be terrified so thats what Im doing
t1_duqh56m	1	*	The house gets fully reelected every 2 years.  If a major anti incumbent wave hits, senators in the next cycle will take notice.  But instead, we reelected 90+ % of them.
t1_duq8lso	0	*	How so?
t1_duqdatu	1	*	The MSS never overthrew a single South American government.
t1_duqhp9k	1	*	Obviously not which is why I voted for her. I was responding to a comment saying that theres no reason not to like her.  
t1_duq817j	1	*	*unsheathes pitchfork*
t1_duq9fr2	0	*	Do you honestly believe anyone is going to go through to check them all? This is just another propaganda technique that involves throwing a wall of info at your opponent. Forgot the name for it

t1_duqgbwe	0	*	Irrelevant? Tell that to Trump. 
t1_duqcvao	1	*	Making a lot of assumptions about my awareness of our politics my friend. 
t1_duqe0u6	0	*	Of course it didn't.  They only thought a gun could shoot once every 20 seconds or whatever.  Not 20 times a fucking second. 
t1_duq8k04	0	*	Yes, you've already corrected me once U0001f601
t1_duqh2vw	0	*	But... he's not in congress?
t1_durvqsj	1	*	The fuk kinda world you live in m8

t1_dusccua	1	*	We were talking about the Reddit sarcasm tag    /s  \^that thing
t1_dur8ivb	0	*	**HAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHABAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHA**
t1_durbcwu	0	*	Yeah, at some point you have to stop making excuses and face reality.  Socialism is both a failed ideology *and* not really a desired outcome.
t1_dur9l0l	1	*	Yawn. Another it was REAL communism apologist. Please. Go to Cuba.

t1_dsgxlxa	0	*	The lambo was an obvious metaphor... Guess thinking is too hard these days
t1_dsimimn	0	*	The second one is what we were talking about - it's not serious, it's a play on popular memes.  Edit: look up each line with the word meme

t1_dspeoc9	1	*	Stop making sweets look like my Tidepool!
t1_dskuuvw	0	*	Doesn't work like that, if I'm paying more everyone else has to as well. Voluntarily overpaying tax just benefits the greediest.
t1_dskoewr	0	*	Literally every president ever was better than trump.  Doesnt make any senss to choose a shitty one as the one to miss, especially when Obama was more recent and decent.
t1_dsm645g	0	*	Battersea is considered dangerous? Do you know how many luxury blocks of flats are being built here? 
t1_dskuc6s	0	*	No narrative, I'm just hesitant to trust polls. Not because of political bias but because their are numerous variables that are not always accounted for.
t1_dsksgdk	1	*	Yea, because I'm American.
t1_dskzilk	0	*	I can't tell if you're sarcastic, but what I said is not wrong.

t1_dsktsb3	0	*	Do I need to provide an easily searchable video for you
t1_dskxtvt	1	*	Yeah, as a So Cal resident, the traffic gets worse every year, cost of living is outrageous, BS politics... but the amazing food, women, weed, beach, and weather outweigh all of the negative IMO.

t1_dskrmzb	0	*	Several people in this thread, thought ya would have creeped through my post history like the guy i replyed too.
t1_dsl5slj	1	*	I believe he also undermined the outrage that is terrorism. Hes questionable on some fronts. Again, I said he isnt great. Not that he isnt good.

t1_du7r124	0	*	Why are you implying that Palestinians are uneducated? They have a higher literacy rate than the USA.
t1_du7ow8o	1	*	Thanks for the genuine laugh. 
t1_du7uv4g	1	*	At this point just nuke the region after evacuating everyone. /s  If you kids can't share, no one gets to play  
t1_du7chws	1	*	Yeah dude! And last week I read an article on Tiananmen Square while I was in Bejing.   Oh wait. No, no I didn't.
t1_du882jp	1	*	The UN has publicly apologized on numerous occasions on their own website for storing weapons for Hamas.
t1_du7d904	1	*	LifeProTip: Add some distilled water to those cores and a little Epsom salts for a little more life. **Plz read up on this prior to actually trying it. 
t1_du83mnz	1	*	Yes indeed, what we call today Palestinian nationalism is a reaction to waves of Jewish immigrants who openly declared they wish to become the majority and create a Jewish state in Palestine.  
t1_du770p7	0	*	the tapes aren't quoting LBJ, but even if they were conspiracies, Nixon still stayed in Nam for his entire presidency while bombing their neighbors and entertaining thoughts of nuclear weapon use. 
t1_du7gf69	0	*	Lol. You call that a straw man? Thats an actual argument I see on reddit all the time, *and you were literally* **just defending** pro holocaust sentiments, you Nazi fucker. 
t1_du7ml5e	1	*	So is Hamas.
t1_du7ep8b	1	*	For sure. Data classification aside, I think we're in agreement here!
t1_dsgi7t4	1	*	\~_~
t1_dsfggap	0	*	Religion isn't the problem, authoritarianism is. The ussr managed to be plenty antiscientific while being ruthlessly antitheist. 
t1_dsfczvz	0	*	Strange... How many Christians nations have slaves? Oh right. None.  How many Muslim countries? All of them
t1_duvxawy	0	*	China? What are you talking about
t1_dt8a8a1	0	*	Sure am glad you didn't qualify it as absolute gibberish. 
t1_dsyrc3z	1	*	Might be able to dig it out on avherald.com
t1_dt4uizt	0	*	im not arguing that per capita it isn't high.. im arguing that ours is the only one that is going down.. while others are going up..
t1_dt4cgsp	0	*	umm.. because regulations don't help.. so why have them?
t1_dscwkin	1	*	Some say it's quite gorgeous. 
t1_dscmw6s	0	*	Yeah, voluntary exchange is part of it, but to say that capitalism is voluntary exchange isn't an accurate definition
t1_dsfnrcp	1	*	So you contend that the Berlin Wall was a natural border and a product of evolution?
t1_dsctv5q	0	*	I said humour. When did I say intelligence? 
t1_dsczvvb	1	*	I'm on 40hours at the moment for a few more weeks and its like a holiday.  Checked the stats, 40 hours is indeed 'normal'.
t1_dsd7cw1	1	*	You misread what he is saying. He is saying that rent is obviously more than 3 times what they pay in China so the $3.60/hour goes a hell of a lot further in China than in the US.
t1_dswn3e1	1	*	Yeah, salt water doesn't sound like a great option for fighting wildfires. I was thinking more along the lines of skyscrapers and suburbs.
t1_dsz187r	1	*	So, the land next to the roads is getting diluted salt? And that salt is diluted by what, water? You might even say it's salt water, which is exactly what the original commentator mentioned.
t1_dt7621v	1	*	It's not just size, it's they really good at the democracy thing and understanding marketing. It will take so much energy and time to catch up, most Egyptians would rather just have a dictator. 
t1_ds38dmv	0	*	You know, despite a user name like question the new world order you are very supportive and unquestioning of it.
t1_dusci0b	1	*	Hasnt happened so far, and its better than minimum wage
t1_duz69hy	0	*	>the context in which you say it.  Yeah, and that context was factual. 
t1_dv2zb71	0	*	lol. stay tuned !! 
t1_duznmyy	1	*	And who knows, maybe people answer that way because they really hate Democrats, but they'd still not vote for him. We can hope.
t1_duyn80p	0	*	But when he inevitably signs off on a bill cutting medicaid or some shit, he would do so in a *noble and non-partisan* way!
t1_duz8vqx	1	*	Maybe it have to go that way. Peeling mistakes off on the core of truth. 
t1_duz6tjc	1	*	It's like dying the beer green on Saint Patty's day to discover which drunk bastard is peeing in the river.   All of them.
t1_duyyf62	0	*	I did look, and I saw nothing. Stop lying.
t1_duymf3b	0	*	If you're actually trying to not be rude, holy crap you're doing a terrible job of it.
t1_duzbo41	0	*	You're embarrassing yourself.
t1_duymbmq	1	*	So you're saying Bernie still has a shot!
t1_duym676	1	*	Shouldn't they say Muellller time is heeeere?  I think you just undermined your own point, such as it is. 
t1_duyqnrx	1	*	Awe did we just have a nice discussion in Reddit comments? Now you're gonna make me feel bad for lumping you in with the average asshole. 
t1_duylhbi	1	*	Not an argument 
t1_duytvts	0	*	You're never going to get the results you want if you make up conspiracy theories every time something you don't like happens. 
t1_dsyk7iu	1	*	Oh no! You haven't yet learned that you have 0 power yet :( sorry but impotent commands on reddit don't do anything. I'd be happy to wait if you wanna try again though?
t1_dsyd1lx	0	*	And dont forget the scene where Halle Barre was getting a blowjib from Hugh Jackman...
t1_dsyilsv	1	*	brooooooooooo do yourself a favor! watch that show
t1_dszwg5o	1	*	Trust me, I drew on my own painful experience.
t1_dt3baj0	1	*	I guess we were downvoted because Reddit doesn't like facts and is trying to downplay the severity of this vuln.
t1_dsrvmas	0	*	> How do you know Intel's management engine vulnerability was created for the NSA?  Can you read?  
t1_dt1m4od	1	*	Well, that's the thing about compromise. Both sides have to give something up. **both sides**
t1_ds6mwij	0	*	Tutu must be right, OK, I'll ignore allllllll the evidence and believe him. 
t1_dtxazp9	0	*	Last time I checked, 60% was a solid majority.
t1_dtxbzra	0	*	I mean, the entire political ideology of nationalism would disagree with you, as would most of history, but ok.
t1_dtx9qnu	0	*	Iagree that this person above you is missing the point - Austen is demonstrating the circumstance, not endorsing it.
t1_du957g2	0	*	https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burden_of_proof_(philosophy) the wiki page for burden of proof
t1_dujb1dw	0	*	The truth is that Palestinians lived there first. I don't get why this bothers pro-Israelis so much.
t1_dua2jw4	1	*	If it is a blockaid why do they consistently use the word occupy and occupation? For instance in this [press release](https://www.un.org/press/en/2017/gaef3485.doc.htm).

t1_dv5gfi5	1	*	It really isn't far off hahahahah.
t1_dv5859w	0	*	Gees, it's off the one on the way to Morro Bay.  I wouldn't mind owning a ranch/farm  around there.  Do they have classes in wine making?  /s
t1_dv4xlwu	1	*	You can call him a shady businessman and be 100% accurate, however. And saying that hes shady is probably too generous.
t1_dv4uafn	0	*	You're the one changing the subject from corruption to incompetence in an attempt to try and make your first ill thought out comment relevant. 
t1_duzv9hc	1	*	I thought he was 65?
t1_dtzbl0n	0	*	I guess he's still googling it
t1_dtzv8j1	1	*	No there doesn't need to be a curb on skilled workers coming in and filling skills we lack. In the EU we cant control that from EU countries.
t1_dsfdzd1	0	*	We shouldn't have to water it down to appeal to anyone. This is one organization w/ one point of view. They're only wrong if you disagree w/ them haha
t1_dsfiiis	0	*	Oh stop. Im not making anyone look bad.
t1_dspls8p	0	*	Aye, that would be my guess. I doubt KJU can afford to see it that way though, regardless of what he personally believes. Dictatorships can't survive if they are seen as weak by their people.
t1_dtu9a3x	1	*	One of the premises the Tea Party used against Obama was that he used a lot of Executive Orders. But contrarily in comparison he did less than others. 
t1_dtf4meg	1	*	How does he qualify for an O1? 
t1_dtfvohj	0	*	Everyone has inescapable costs.  Also, do tell.
t1_ds32jm1	1	*	You're missing my point. Capitalism and socialism are not mutually exclusive. In fact, pure capitalism is as farcical as pure socialism.
t1_du0rdox	0	*	You think the nepali are a proxi of the chinese? LOL.
t1_dukrrxq	0	*	I'd go European hegemony easily.  Don't know why you think the only options are a corporate oligarchy or a failed state.
t1_ds9e9ud	1	*	you set a low bar for them, that's for damn sure.
t1_ds87a1d	0	*	What?
t1_dupluk4	0	*	The point is that the outcome will be the same whether you show the photo or you don't. It might even be worse if you don't because the whole group could be punished.  
t1_dspcmy8	0	*	There's only 2 weeks of food in the entire united States supply system.
t1_dsp4mkh	1	*	We call them land-sealions. I tame them. 
t1_dsp8lxq	1	*	I'm interested in learning more about this- can you share stories, resources, links?
t1_dspk1wi	1	*	No he said the opposite. A normal air burst reduces fallout. The drone would be a surface burst, which will yield much larger amounts of fallout. 
t1_dsp62es	0	*	Why not just drop 3 nukes on each of the 3 targets? There's no kill like overkill.
t1_dsp6smn	0	*	So a slightly older bully?

t1_dsp20qt	1	*	Nuclear winter. In a full exchange there will be knockon effects from the fire storms will block out light.
t1_dsou9vv	1	*	As I understand it's less dust evacuated from the actual craters that blocks the sun and more soot injected into the stratosphere from hundreds of massive urban firestorms.
t1_dsquc7f	1	*	[relevant xkcd](https://what-if.xkcd.com/29/)
t1_dsowa2a	1	*	I think I remember the dust not being from the nukes themselves, but from burning cities. I believe the nukes are hot enough to burn concrete. 
t1_dsp1v43	1	*	Yeah, submarines have propellers too! Speaking of which, buddy of mine gave me props the other day. Guess I'm a plane as well.
t1_dsp26di	1	*	Did not know about nuclear shuttle ambition. Thats awesome.

t1_dss7i91	1	*	He's got the pumpy
t1_dsrqsi2	1	*	Thank you.
t1_dsrsgqo	1	*	That's completely irrelevant to the issue of support. Both presidents had identical numbers at this point and both still enjoy significant support, if not more.
t1_dtfl6yb	1	*	Glad I could be of service.
t1_dsrs2lu	1	*	Not that I agree with Trump's tactics but Un doesn't exactly act like he's got a death wish. NK postures within a comfort zone.
t1_dsrrh2t	1	*	That is a VERY high number.
t1_dsl2gbm	1	*	Mmmmmmm.......Lonesome George would be delicious. 
t1_dsl4vwb	0	*	They can't provide a source because it's just a GOP talking point with no actual facts to back it up.

t1_dsl53p0	1	*	I paid $75, as well as other adults I know in a wide range of income levels, not to have ACA coverage. Did you accidentally add that zero? 
t1_dsl5975	1	*	In Windows, search for and open character map in the Start menu for all of them, in all fonts.     If you're on a Mac, then I'm sure that you already have some elitist way to use them.

t1_dsl6y44	0	*	So that's how you get the burning cross emoji. Thanks!
t1_dsl7c0d	0	*	You support an open racist and sexist. Which, best case, means you have no problem with racism and sexism.
t1_dsl89ka	0	*	Honestly.  Just look around at the replies Ive received in this thread.  Nearly 100% are replies to comments I never made nor came close to making.  
t1_dsl667m	1	*	>reasons completely unrelated to the autism nonsense
t1_dsl7ljb	1	*	Fascism *should* be censored. You can't debate fascism. [20th-century philosophers like Bertrand Russell knew that.](http://www.lettersofnote.com/2016/02/every-ounce-of-my-energy.html)
t1_dsachv3	0	*	In-N-Out is absolutely dominating their competitors so I would say that whatever they are doing differently from their competitors is working pretty well.
t1_ds9nr27	0	*	You can say that again
t1_dsa3wcm	1	*	Lmao you set yourself up for that one
t1_dtw2i6x	1	*	You can always go to private sector if you want to be fast. The important thing is that the private sector isn't the only option.
t1_dtve4ok	1	*	That happens in America when they are at capacity too. What the fuck do you think  at capacity  means?
t1_du1td0i	0	*	Don't you mean freedom fighter?
t1_dstcqq7	0	*	Did I say that?  What I said is that the ones most likely to be rapist and pedophiles are also the ones most likely to be in it for benefits rather than faith.
t1_dssxec5	1	*	I'd think you'd have to be a weirdo in general.
t1_dsm7t2y	1	*	Well, OK then. Your post was kind of pointless, then.

t1_dsm5qpd	0	*	The most imaginative I've gotten was congee. Thanks for the advice!
t1_dsnf5ak	0	*	thats muscles contracting and it's very different.  Think about it like cockroaches who live for long time without their head.  Often without a head they die simply because of starvation.

t1_dsmbomk	1	*	Cause that makes it taste niiiiice U0001f3b5
t1_dsm92ny	1	*	So you're in the industry then. I can see why you wouldn't like this law.  I actually put unwanted bugs in a glass and take them outside...
t1_dsm9heo	0	*	He didn't dodge the point, you did. You said it would be an increased cost, he pointed out that all kitchens have knives.  I don't like deer hunting either.
t1_dsm60j4	0	*	Good on you. I'll continue to not shrug my shoulders and think you do you when I hear of unnecessary cruelty. 
t1_dshi6be	0	*	>What thousands?   Hundreds? I am still impressed you managed to read ALL of them to be able to spot mine.   > This changes nothing  It does, because you explicitly stated the contrary.

t1_dthtpzl	0	*	> The US is not really a democracy, Germany is.  Rofl, next level ignorance. On multiple levels.  This is why people stopped caring about Europe's opinions.
t1_dulr5ms	1	*	> Why didnt large terrorist groups emerge  They did, but they were made rich by primarily U.S. policies. They're called cartels.
t1_dum8uw9	1	*	Ikr! I stopped at the episode where Barkhorn got issued the first jet engines and, knowing the history of the Me-262 I had a dumb grin on my face the whole time. I gotta finish the rest of the season!

t1_ds7s404	1	*	Yeah, that is what youve been doing isnt it
t1_dtbnmzq	1	*	Thanks, that's a much more compelling/complete answer.  I feel like that would be a nice footnote for the data, and it's a bit of a shame it wasn't included.
t1_dscftir	1	*	I always knew they were around, I just didn't know they were calling themselves that even that far back. 
t1_dsco837	1	*	So what if it's off topic. This is an internet forum. If you don't want to read it then don't read it and downvote. Other people might find this conversation interesting so it's here.

t1_dscey1r	0	*	I was agreeing with you in that people generally suck and we shouldn't be surprised by behavior like this.
t1_dukfwy4	1	*	I mean that's actually insane. You think you're just smarter than all these people. You're cold so the world isn't getting hotter. Amazing.
