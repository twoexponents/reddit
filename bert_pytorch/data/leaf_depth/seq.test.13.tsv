t1_dtbxat0	1	*	They used to have them but they sold a lot of it if not all of it. 
t1_dub8obf	0	*	Yeah, it's the 21st century, and Russia has invaded two of it's neighbors in the last 10 years; Georgia and Ukraine, with tanks and footsoldiers. Don't write back.  
t1_duonivn	0	*	So do you believe democracy is necessary?
t1_dtlqm1f	0	*	Damn forgot skin crawls.  
t1_dtnlt92	0	*	Are you sure? Because you seem pretty salty about the fact that I called you out on your obvious BS.
t1_dtlpp1i	1	*	Hmm weird. That's the first election I was eligible for so I guess makes sense that I didn't realise that. Thanks
t1_dubw8ma	0	*	Yeah I suppose listing a bunch of verifiable facts could be called low effort, but it's more effort than reposting days of propaganda China is so green and clean and beautiful 
t1_dtl1nt6	1	*	>     Are you really arguing that tattooing a swastika on a child for religious reasons should be legal too? >  > Sure if thats what their religion says.    I rest my case.
t1_dt2cpq2	1	*	No, it didn't. Also, source your claim.
t1_dsbkynh	0	*	Actually you're deflecting because my comment originally questioned your communist ideology. Nice try. 
t1_dug5fgx	0	*	Ok.   Putin, open and honest.  A spy MASTER is never these things.  But, ok.   I DO appreciate your effort, thank you. We just wont come to an accord. Well wishes.
t1_dujgyni	1	*	I dunno maybe there are some UN conventions or something we could look at to find these definitions. 
t1_dsxha9y	1	*	Again, your claims were that they deport them based on race, not because they were economic migrants. There were no proof for such claims.
t1_ds9ivgp	0	*	Divisible means no remainder.
t1_ds90l0f	0	*	You guys are a bunch of squares.
t1_du496aj	1	*	Its good that I have a American perspective on the conflict.  Thanks.
t1_dv22coz	1	*	I'm sure there are many mexicans that also wish cartels didn't exist  Also   >you are one of those nonsense creators    Lol  >so you support third world torture
t1_dsq5z9h	1	*	How do you know it did?
t1_dtxrkt5	1	*	Lying by omission? Grow up, not everyone is as dense as you when it comes to history. 
t1_dunkyxo	1	*	You are more likely to die from a stab wound than a bullet. At a rate of 1.8% to 2%  So you might want to check that, sources are from British crime reports, comparing deaths to weapon use
t1_dugf5aa	1	*	I guess I'll have to learn about aboriginal tribes now. That sounds intriguing.
t1_dsus84r	0	*	The Israelis have repeatedly offered peace and the palestinians only respond with additional attacks.  That is reality regardless of if you are willing to let reality have an impact on your opinions.
t1_dsta0s9	1	*	But if a Palestinian is shot its probably justified.   Replace Palestinian with black and you sound like a bigot. Think.
t1_duttitc	0	*	Glad we agree on the cause of the measle problem.
t1_duturms	1	*	So you trust these doctors because they say what you want but not the other thousands because they say what you don't want?
t1_dv533ql	0	*	That's a pretty good up speed compared to the down.   But Jesus that's expensive.   I get 100 down and 25 up for under $100.
t1_dv49bna	1	*	Ah fair enough :)
t1_dv49yz9	1	*	I'm so sorry to hear that. My condolences. 
t1_dv4l49d	1	*	That's what happens when idiots use alt account to attempt to deny reality.
t1_ds5df92	0	*	Oh you're right, sorry, got turned around.  You obviously aren't interested in an actual discussion, so I wouldn't be responding further.

t1_ds172s2	1	*	Basically, you just listed whatever countries USA doesnt like, not North Koreas allies.
t1_dujtjnx	0	*	Proved my point.
t1_ds2i857	0	*	I dont think there is no difference, I just dont think there is a relevant difference in this case? If you think there is one then say it.
t1_dto2lia	0	*	Yeah, I think you are replying to the wrong person. I was just saying Americans hate price increases without anything more to it, you're on about something else entirely.
t1_dtsfmoy	1	*	Well don't hold your breath, you'll pass out eventually.
t1_dtnzsqt	0	*	There it is. NorCal, Central Valley, or OC? #nixondidnothingwrong
t1_dto1qks	0	*	So ironic, I can't even with you.
t1_dtp67tg	1	*	Yeah this guy was very sweet to me the whole time. Im a monster.  He called me stupid in every one of his unsolicited comments and wouldnt provide sources when I called him on it. Fuck both of you. 
t1_dum8ek8	1	*	how rude, have you missed the trend here? the right thing to say is a patronizing i feel bad for the Russians and shed a tear. or two.
t1_dumayx3	1	*	mucho excellente. i am sunbathing on the beach of the gulf of finland right now.
t1_dumlxrt	1	*	I was tested. I have been found to not have donkey brains. 
t1_du2nci1	0	*	A keeper for what? Say to what? Wtf are you even talking about??
t1_durlm8a	0	*	So I say  >*and leaves out a whole lot in between.*  And yet the only thing you can think to type up is WE LEARNED ABOUT TRAIL OF TEARS 5 TIMES. As if I said we were never taught the trail of tears...
t1_dv868fz	0	*	That was over a week ago I have moved on entirely lol
t1_duz4yp7	1	*	Yeah, that's the last thing I'm worried about.  Impaling babies on bayonets is not forgivable.   Read a book.
t1_duti4nu	1	*	alright. So that article is, quite frankly, a load of horseshit. The author of that article is so anti-nuclear *anything* that he bemoans nuclear power as the Devil. 
t1_durn8p0	1	*	Thank
t1_dsh9m2l	0	*	Reduce the population from 7 billion to 1 billion.  Either mass sterilization or mass genocide.  Either way it's not the best argument you've made.  
t1_dsug82q	0	*	The point that Trump is the reason for recent economic success still stands, uncontested. 
t1_dtblp1k	0	*	In order for that to hapoen a majority of states will need to legalize weed which i dont realistically see happening within a decade in fact 2 is stretching.
t1_dtfii4e	1	*	Okay well then that would be the Chinese selling out their race instead of the white man.
t1_dtfz6rv	0	*	Yes, an intermediary let them know what Steele was doing. 
t1_dsqcp2j	0	*	Hehe whites age poorly and the sun hates them U0001f602U0001f923  Some master race U0001f44d

t1_du8lnv7	0	*	What would that even look like, a truly leftist political entity here in the States?
t1_du8vsuu	1	*	All I said was it could be because theyre scared...  Stop having imaginary arguments. 
t1_du8xfrz	1	*	So, what, do you think hospitals and medics will get covert orders to just let every third patient die so their organs can be harvested? Like, what do you think the problem is going to be
t1_du982ev	0	*	The implication is that a non-atheist would care how their body is treated after death, which is often (but not always) true.
t1_dt3rzkl	1	*	wait...are you a 46 year old scottish man?  also i get 3 guesses
t1_dtra2wx	0	*	This is news...
t1_dtpep5z	0	*	What you're saying is we should trust them absolutely, despite no evidence supporting their point and a very obvious reason to mislead the public? Just trying to clarify here.
t1_ds517qk	0	*	Why don't you ask South Koreans about that.
t1_dupuvf5	0	*	Are you a troll or just that lacking in self awareness? Either way, what are you doing with your life?
t1_dslp2q3	0	*	You don't have to pay income tax on the first 300k...what?
t1_dtncpry	0	*	Are you counting local police forces and military escalations?
t1_ds3qoeo	1	*	That is the President's motto 
t1_dtvsndv	0	*	i like your banter, pleasant, ill strive to be more like you
t1_dtvgua1	0	*	Not me, but their behaviour.
t1_dtwpa7t	0	*	It sounded like you were justifying the lions death by saying humans have this psychological connection that makes us care more about them than we should. Sorry.
t1_dtvkcna	1	*	Me neither.
t1_dtvgjyx	0	*	I mean I think the trailer seemed cutesy and all but I've heard it mentioned twice this week on Reddit about it having themes involving animal cruelty.
t1_dtvpgh9	1	*	> Shouldnt sub par be a good thing?  At first I was going to say no, then I remembered golf.  Looking it up, apparently has to do with bonds values, not golf.
t1_dtyphnh	0	*	Well THAT don't sound like an overgeneralisation.  Say stupid things, get stupid responses.
t1_dtvx4md	0	*	So which of those places do you live in?

t1_ds3hvac	0	*	Are you 12 ahaha :P xD!!
t1_dsnijwd	0	*	Depends on the drone. The thing is designed to shoot at missiles. Slow moving drones wouldn't be much of a problem. 
t1_dupdbc9	0	*	so agriculture subsidies wouldn't exist without illegal immigration? what are you talking about?
t1_duo0e9n	0	*	Are you using neoliberalisms actual definition or the pejorative one thats in vogue right now?
t1_duo7m8w	0	*	Im not ignoring the complications, Im implying you are. Its not as simple as a lot of people agree on something at this exact moment, lets make it law. And for good reason. 
t1_dunset1	1	*	There's something refreshing about the pure bluntness.
t1_dunto2v	0	*	Considering it's the actions of the west that destabilized and impoverished the third world, I'd say we deserve it.
t1_dsgcfmq	1	*	China does own that market, and with panel prices approaching 30 cents per watt, solar is economical in a lot of places.
t1_dsh29i2	1	*	Voted Sanders in the primary.   Voted Clinton in the general.  You really need to watch how you jump to conclusions, that's going to get you into trouble some day.
t1_dttkoda	0	*	Dumb buzzword is dumb.
t1_dtv24zt	0	*	Darling, everything Ive said is in favor of a *free* market.  I feel like you have been  misguided on what you think a true free market is. 
t1_dttec8m	1	*	I dont write proper english? Is there something ive said that you dont understand? Why are you so angry?
t1_dtuaeko	1	*	Power is everything, throughout the history of life.  Morals and ethics are nice and all, but if your opponent does not have any then what's the point?
t1_du2la24	1	*	The states. :P   House costs $1 mill for a 2 bedroom. college costs $60k a year (out of the range of any 18 year old without help). Any major health problem will cost you 6 figures. 
t1_dttkiia	0	*	Just loans that I haven't been able to pay back and the interest rate is killing me :( Yes my daughter is real. 
t1_dtu3897	1	*	got em

t1_dttpdbi	0	*	I just said that I meant to say 'socialism' instead of 'communism'.
t1_dttjrz3	1	*	I agree with you 100%
t1_dttdyo6	0	*	Passport and DL are fine but again, dmvs were shut down. That and poll taxes are supposed to be illegal but Republicans found a sneaky way of bringing them back via voter id laws. 
t1_dturpvl	0	*	Ok honey. Hope you have a great life. 
t1_dttt9r2	0	*	I guess that's a fair point if the industry would otherwise pay quite well. If it's low-paying, then minimum wage laws are one of the best ways to combat the issue. 
t1_dttfcgq	1	*	I have a friend who is earning more than I will and never went to uni as well. Apprenticeships are amazing
t1_dttmhpq	1	*	I'm not american myself, but ive seen the statistics on reddit enough to know its extremely common. Someone else in this thread linked yhe numbers
t1_duq7u4y	0	*	Yeah nah. We Australians do yeah nah and nah yeah just as much. Sounds different when spoken.

t1_dteiefk	1	*	I'm talking about the primaries, not Trump.
t1_dtdv6bu	1	*	Now you're moving goal posts, and strangely still not making a better case for your argument. 
t1_dte2cy4	1	*	You're responding to someone named Petroleum-Engineer.
t1_dte7ole	0	*	Obama met those criteria, sure. Except an important one -- he couldn't run in 2016.  I'm talking about at this specific time period. Not just hypothetically.
t1_dte0q3r	0	*	Is cultural anxiety a new euphemism for racism I'm not aware of?  Edit: Although the article doesn't mention the examples from your comment.
t1_dte2279	1	*	Clearly you've never been or known a business owner. Regulations screw over small businesses and give large businesses an unfair advantage. 
t1_dteaojp	0	*	Look bro if youre going to keep deflecting there is no point in even making youre argument. Might as well just delete your original comment
t1_dunpuuv	0	*	do you pay more in taxes than you owe? Or do you just want other people to do that?
t1_dsvg8s6	0	*	Im a history major so...I am. Guns > rocks.     But Im not even saying rebellion is bad, just that acting surprised by consequences is childish and pointless. 
t1_dv23uzv	1	*	You may be right.  We'll see.
t1_dugno3b	0	*	a failure to communicate on your part does not mean a failure of understanding on my part.  Speak plainly.
t1_ds9eulk	1	*	I do know for sure what my original comment said. You also know that you didn't fully read my comment or you would have noticed the only thing in parenthesis.   Not anger. Just facts.
t1_dsb0cnd	1	*	No. I'm not funny. Don't encourage me. It only makes things worse... Wait...   I'm a brat and It'll only get wurst. 
t1_ds9ymtz	0	*	I prefer to listen to countries that aren't dependent on the US for their security because they're not about to break ranks with their sugar daddy. 
t1_dsa6unw	1	*	Not in the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  I.e. Syria has not wiped out more Israelis than Israel has wiped out Arabs. Ditto for Saudi, Iran, Egypt, Lebanon etc...
t1_dsa3f91	1	*	Cool so you won't mind if Palestinians 'create a state' too. 
t1_dtd1oh4	0	*	Bahahaha did you jump on your alt account just to have a meltdown hahahahaha
t1_dtd1tep	0	*	Nope. You're the one claiming the sky is green (and that immigrants are the reason for it).
t1_dsxk4l0	0	*	> His spirit resides in the living things all around you.  Yes, that is the claim. What is the evidence for this claim? How do you detect this spirit?
t1_dsdt4yv	0	*	The kid is eligible for welfare not the undocumented immigrant. FYI the kid is a Citizen, just to clarify things for you

t1_dt6qpto	0	*	The Iraq war happened at the same time as massive tax cuts for wealthy people, by literally the same president.
t1_ds5wwrk	1	*	I will agree with that. Though far fetched, an attack or war MIGHT turn things in his favor. 
t1_dszgmb7	1	*	This is the magic of the internet
t1_dv0madt	0	*	No one said they didnt choose their path or deal with the consequences, i said that anti-terrorism practices that are most common ie. killing, air strikes, assassinations only create more terrorists.
t1_dv0m9xa	0	*	There is less terrorism? Really?
t1_duyd7mn	0	*	Yeah, I'm just going to stop wasting my time with you. If you can't see the difference between crimes of Clintons and Putin you're a lost cause.
t1_dv8gye1	1	*	;-)   
t1_dv03q6a	0	*	Nice response.
t1_dsn57ys	1	*	Cool.

t1_dthvrxv	1	*	Ahhhh I gotcha, I gotcha. Thank you for the clarification. Word, I can concede to that point.
t1_duvk0lv	1	*	You know the whole world suffers from Trump's antics.  I wouldn't be so smug.

t1_duunet7	1	*	There's a pretty big difference when you put it there at the request of that nation, compared to the Great Britain style of forcing yourself on them and expanding in that manner. 
t1_duvpt2r	1	*	I agree with your view point
t1_duy76qn	1	*	One more interesting article on that sheriff: https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2018-02-27/broward-county-officials-opened-66-investigations-misconduct-under-sheriff-israel  
t1_duuse99	1	*	Sure, some are. And provided that this was the way whales were killed, I would be OK with hunting and eating them.
t1_duv4h2q	0	*	?  Interceptors are generally pretty big. See the MIG-25/31
t1_duvdtba	1	*	Yeah, see the problem is the people arrested for protesting tend to start burning shit and smashing windows.   That's called rioting. 
t1_dt25q08	0	*	You discredited your own analysis by yourself, so... what's your point?
t1_dt7al7h	0	*	No the government needs to make sure people ARE safe.   How you feel doesn't matter, and catcalling/sexist behaviour doesn't harm you.
t1_dtaaiax	0	*	Those are about rape in the US, not about street harassment in France.
t1_dtx5qw1	1	*	Please don't bother :) 
t1_du0b016	0	*	Referee dispute here. Objective facts supplemented by evidence could support the original insult as being factual in nature. 
t1_dsh49z8	1	*	Exactly, RBI was founded by 3G, not BK. burger has never owned Tim Hortons. It's factually incorrect to say Burger King owns Tim Hortons. 
t1_dsh1luo	1	*	I might be mistaken but the original guy saying McD's wasn't doing good in the US posted sources, and the guy refuting that point source is stuck behind a paywall of 50$.  
t1_dsh8quv	0	*	I guess you didn't read the comment I asked you to.   https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/7pewgj/canadians_are_mad_as_hell_at_tim_hortons_boycotts/dsh64t0/?context=3
t1_dshe7s5	1	*	All the more reason to not franchise and not have to pay all that shit.
t1_dsh5amf	0	*	Revenue is whats left over after expenses are applied. The links i provided show that revenue is down so while income is up, so are expenses. 
t1_dsigla2	0	*	You sound like you're still living with your parents without any concept of how living in the real world works 
t1_dshtc9g	0	*	where was I put in my place?
t1_dshjyp9	0	*	> https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/11/507  Your own link says that domestic support obligations get paid first.   Where do you see the Bankruptcy Court being paid on the priority list? 
t1_dsigodg	1	*	Do you believe in the concept known as mental health?
t1_dt7y3ek	0	*	The only good part of this would be seeing people like you getting beaten to a pulp by the fathers of the consenting 8 year old children that you would try to have a relationship with.
t1_dtg0547	1	*	The people who took my grand parents home and beat them when they came back from camp

t1_dt18oom	1	*	LOL a whole week and you still thinking of me?  Look I know I'm in demand but you gotta let it go...
t1_dsm0fs5	0	*	A year of saying and doing terrible things. The unprecedented corruption, the breaking of long established conduct norms, this is just who he is
t1_dsnljaa	1	*	It depends on where you're talking about. Chinese emigrated to many places, especially in the 20th century.
t1_dsm4rrg	1	*	Chinese here, I'm okay with that, there's only one race which is the human race.
t1_dslzawn	1	*	I don't support Trump.
t1_dsm67bj	1	*	Lmao
t1_dt42ukw	0	*	And your argument that that does reflect organization?
t1_dt2ns63	1	*	There is no way that these Israelis entered the village without the coordination of multiple government agencies. According to this article, no arrests where made. They are complicit.    
t1_dudtt54	1	*	I actually had a great time doing my PhD. None of the horror stories applied to my experience. I hope the same goes for you :)
t1_dudyfst	0	*	Dang well you got me here. This clever response really puts me in my place and I'll never think outside the hive mind again. Thanks for that. 
t1_due13mv	0	*	Because price controls would have an effect on whether drugs would continue to be created in the future.  Unintended consequences of our actions and all that. 
t1_due03h0	1	*	[citation needed]
t1_due5hfh	0	*	Inhale deeper, then ;)
t1_due73ep	1	*	If only we had internet pricing and speed like South Korea in poverty-stricken Canada.
t1_dudsqac	0	*	Lol thats not edgy.  Why did you respond with this instead of providing examples to answer the question and support your claim?
t1_duw9lsk	0	*	I like how you think you've presented any facts, here or indeed at any point in your life. It's adorable, really.
t1_dulgm6x	1	*	We have arrived at the problem. 
t1_dtan3nl	0	*	yeah and cat calling isnt complementing someone you know, its harassing a random woman  how are you this dense? 
t1_dst9b1l	1	*	That's another question. I just pointed out that your first sentence was wrong.
t1_dsqn78h	0	*	What the fuck are you even responding to? My whole post about how this incident was **not** a conspiracy. 
t1_dsrhm8p	1	*	I don't think he understands much of anything, anyone who disagrees is alt-right, fascist, Nazi, trump supporter etc etc.
t1_dsqu44r	1	*	Sure. Capitalism has positive aspects and negative aspects. I can appreciate the benefits.
t1_dss9o8q	1	*	Bibliographic rules?
t1_dsq7srd	1	*	It already passed long ago. It's not a law. It's a motion (note the M in M-103), aka a public statement by Parliament. Educate yourself.
t1_dsz8fk4	0	*	Annnnnd you lost. lol
t1_dsfmgb0	1	*	*Wilhelm scream*
t1_dt1pivs	0	*	Thank you for proving my point better than I ever could.
t1_dt1dhsk	1	*	67 is a supermajority on the basis of being veto-proof. 
t1_dt1lnks	1	*	No, that one includes tying a concrete block to your leg and chucking yourself in a river.
t1_dt32zft	0	*	I'm not. You can't convey my charming sarcasm via text.
t1_dt2d82c	1	*	Except you are attacking me! Don't tell yourself otherwise. You're entitled to your opinion but I honestly don't care. 
t1_dt1hzzk	1	*	Got it. I believe that the number to overturn a veto is what's considered a supermajority is the point that I was trying to made (which I will concede may not have been made very well).
t1_dt2ggj8	1	*	It would, but the R folk made certain that collective bargaining be filed under evil socialism and kill jobs...cause there were no jobs during the height of Union power. 
t1_dt1cqne	0	*	Sorry. I got triggered (not being ironic). It pains me when people say the American dream isnt alive simply because they think its a walk in the park to be successful within it. 
t1_dt1oi1v	1	*	Guess you're calling Harvard Press a holocaust denier cause they're the ones who admit the black book of communism is filled with errors.
t1_dt19svq	1	*	it means that grammar nazis and word definition arguments come to prevail in mediocre and petty minds who are not advancing a discussion on the actual topic. perhaps they are unable to 
t1_dt01ucv	1	*	A link to a Wikipedia page??!  Yeah and so what? Whats your point!?
t1_dsz6pjl	0	*	Keep tap dancing, but the music stopped hours ago. 
t1_ds55qyd	1	*	Really?! That sucks. In Canada boobs are allowed in public, i hope they are free there soon as well.
t1_ds6m0hl	0	*	Another non-sequitur, neat! But, you don't wanna use those for arguments, and especially not for that thud of a quip you just attempted.
t1_duh3y16	1	*	You do get that Flynn is working for the FBI now, right Ivan?
t1_dugwlq4	1	*	Look man, I with you, I hope something happens.

t1_duhsros	1	*	You just proved his point with this comment   Well done, bravo 
t1_dui54x8	1	*	You only read headlines. What's the diff?
t1_duhxjix	0	*	The Nazis *got rid* of gun control.  That way, when they whipped up their population into Fear Of Not-Me, they could shoot all the minorities themselves.  
t1_duho8ok	1	*	And the right to bear arms is included in those unalienable rights you speak of. Kek.
t1_dtc0pw7	0	*	It's all about relativity. All countries have red and black in their ledger, but compared to a lot of other countries, China isn't all about that sharp power.

t1_dtj4llz	0	*	Why would the cost go up when theres no change in purchasing power?
t1_dur6z24	1	*	It's not though.  OP is about us gun control . . .

t1_dt07vry	1	*	Can we get a remake then.... that's a little more interesting?
t1_dszy3u6	0	*	It would be an outrageous abuse of power if he does that.
t1_dt06sma	1	*	Like GTA V. GTA V had this kind of mission where you had to execute the CEO of a company so the competitor stock you invested in could rise. 
t1_dt08sas	0	*	America is probably the most dangerous Western country. A place where the media has a hard time figuring out why to hate a guy who shot and killed 58 people because he wasn't a muslim.
t1_dt03bxu	0	*	Do you have evidence that I made a ridiculous assertion though? 
t1_dszyqx7	0	*	You're not supposed to just concede the possibility. What in the hell are we supposed to do now?
t1_dt17mkw	0	*	You fundamentally do not understand the concept. The Soviets had capital too, they were an economic super power. Doesn't change that they were a communist state.
t1_dtn1hax	0	*	Why are you suddenly attempting to change the subject?   What does the efficiency of the polio vaccine have to do with the effectiveness estimates for the QIV vaccine?
t1_dtnizn1	1	*	Hey baby, are you a doctor? Because you just cured my erectile dysfunction.  ( xb0  xb0) 
t1_dt5i3jk	1	*	Those alternatives sometimes are not easy to access or are harmful to certain individuals. Have you ever asked yourself why people get high in the first place?
t1_dt4ueei	1	*	smells like weed smoke, but not sure if hes growing or not, but given that he isnt home all the time but the wife is but the wife dont smoke weed, Im guessing he isnt growing
t1_dt4ku7e	1	*	I mean, I wouldn't doubt if any one of those three things are true, but I stand by my statement.
t1_dt546xu	1	*	Right!!?
t1_dsm2lz5	1	*	How is any of this relevant to the topic at hand? It's just another stupid nationalist attempt to justify war crimes.
t1_dsjv84s	1	*	lol my only point was that China is already selective about its history and heavily censors it. 
t1_dttmt3h	0	*	your right its more lie 12%  https://www.gov.uk/national-insurance-rates-letters 
t1_ds8orp9	0	*	So then you would agree that since most of the liquid money being spent is by the middle class, a price increase on items might have a detrimental effect on their savings rate?
t1_ds8tap9	0	*	So tim hortons should't be required to pay the actual cost of their labor?
t1_dti3qc4	1	*	Correlation versus causation bro
t1_dtd4rg6	0	*	This person posted to r the_donald several times
t1_dtd5lkc	0	*	of course.  but then again i tend to agree with scientists and scientific concensus over a guy who couldn't keep casinos from going bankrupt and knows fuck all about everything else.
t1_dtdf3mg	1	*	Somebody like that lies to themselves. 
t1_dtd29r5	0	*	lol okay so you don't have an answer. You're just more knuckledragging Trumptrash.   Carry on.  
t1_dtloank	0	*	Uh, so is the company I mentioned. That doesn't stop the public from being able to see the earnings (and the investments done).
t1_dtdx3ms	1	*	Yeah I was confused
t1_dtdczmt	1	*	And what are most people, intelligent? Ha.    So there are a bunch of idiots who think someone else is the real idiot. 
t1_dtdqmtp	0	*	I just want to point out that Hillary moving closer to Bernie on some issues was good, and wasn't her just waffling, it was her giving her constituents what they wanted
t1_dtdnngp	1	*	Ohhh, yeah. In the US, its a raw, face to face percentage of votes cast, and in most states, the winner of a state gets the whole state
t1_dte7ubm	0	*	And Im telling you that I did try.  Sorry for the contention - wish you the best.
t1_dsic7ke	0	*	Not sure the point you are trying to make. The ability to appoint supreme Court judges is an very relevant campaign issue especially for the current t POTUS.
t1_dssr3ch	0	*	Charming. Very charming 
t1_dsr4i1g	0	*	But it's not my penis, it's my son's.    You can do to your body what you please. But you can't force your decisions onto others. It's personal autonomy at it's most basic level.

t1_duifajg	0	*	What if they pay once after it's levied and then leave before tax season comes around again? 
t1_duib7x8	0	*	After doing that we still had more left than the median household income in the US.  It's simple to live on that since most people already do. 
t1_duiniba	0	*	You realize the data you linked shows a marked and steady increase over the course of Obama's terms, right?
t1_duiexbe	1	*	And without Microsoft there is Apple, without Apple there is IBM. These markets are filled by a race, they would still exist without Bill Gates. 
t1_duib7ak	1	*	Welp...... i will quietly back away with my tail between my legs...... Updated my response. 
t1_duicdzp	0	*	Paid for by ...?
t1_duih82j	0	*	What percent of houses are 500,000 dollars or more?
t1_duiemne	0	*	> Trump's policies are helping the economy NOW. That is undeniable.  Is he helping the economy or is he helping your paycheck? They're not the same.
t1_duic7to	1	*	Lol, it doesn't prevent people from earning more. It's like you have no idea how progressive taxation systems work.
t1_dui9lbt	0	*	I didn't say they're a myth, just almost one.  There's less than a thousand of them in america, that's almost no existence compared to 370m Americans.
t1_duior70	1	*	I know youre being hyperbolic but really graduates now are making like $56k right out of college on average. I dont think we have more slackers than other generations, were just more aware of them.

t1_dtfddkp	1	*	We already have more than enough food to solve world hunger, the issue is getting it to people who need it.
t1_dshbk2b	0	*	But my original response was not to your follow up.  It seems you are trying to move the goalposts when your original comment was obviously wrong.
t1_dsg9gwo	0	*	*We are the Champions plays softly in the background*
t1_dsfx794	1	*	We eat chicken curry most of the time (chicken tikka masala). Plus cooked breakfasts (bacon, eggs and sausages) - cured meats.

t1_dtdce0u	0	*	That seems to be a LOT of people's plan.   Why act? Someone will do something sometime...   The stupidity of humanity is at times too much....
t1_dtcqs95	0	*	Oh good, that solves that then. Make sure to do all the drugs you can while youre at it. 
t1_dtcxx4w	0	*	Great idea! I'll give some a shot. I'll avoid almond milk, though due to the environmental impact of drying out the arid California area. Any suggestions? I like soy milk. Which ones do you like?
t1_dt0bm5y	0	*	Can you cite the case law that references that statement?
t1_dt2ln3h	1	*	That doesn't matter when 99.99% of electronics in the world are unhardened civilian devices
t1_dslyyck	1	*	Being the home of smartarses I actually like that one. That would be Arsetralia down here though. 
t1_dslk5b2	1	*	Sweet judo moves, bro, you got me. 
t1_dsltl63	1	*	Oh, that's why you presented a false dichotomy. Gotcha
t1_duuhywg	1	*	I meant what legal protections would he have? Trump would run him through a secret court.
t1_dupxybt	0	*	So what's your view on restitution in general?
t1_duq2qji	0	*	I also equate taking back stolen land to lynching and enslaving people... no actually, stealing land is much worse. 
t1_du37nji	0	*	I never once said Trump was better in that regard
t1_du2uj64	0	*	They get to compete, at least as an individual.  Maybe if Russians don't like it they could do something to fix their fucked up leadership?
t1_dts2w8c	0	*	Have you considered that the rest of the world uses metric because it's actually better? 
t1_duyhw5v	0	*	Why not just get rid of the second amendment?

t1_duqdrf4	0	*	This guy cracks.
t1_dtrvlbs	1	*	99 percent of those killed were in the attacks themselves. There is army and police in most places. There are also many injured in Gaza due to hamas shooting rockets from civilian areas. 
t1_dtp5ckg	1	*	Cool. Yeah, we are on the same page.
t1_dtorb9m	1	*	But they haven't gotten shot down by a manpad in the last 20 years, and only use guided bombs and munitions except for the gun.   Sorry buddy.
t1_dseqnuc	1	*	> Could they be afraid of the hype being dampened and the party ending?  Yes, thats the reason they put out a bug bounty program with rewards up to a 10000 XRB (currently about 250.000-300.000$)
t1_dtn3vhj	1	*	Probably, but only when they felt strong enough, not immediately.
t1_dtmrppi	0	*	You mean to stop acting like something is putrid simply because it has a GMO label? Oh no! The horror!
t1_dsgt9pp	0	*	You emphasize choice, but often there isn't as much choice in the matter as you'd like to think. People can be forced to do those things through indoctrination, threats, etc. 
t1_dsgqknl	1	*	See [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/7p5mrh/bodies_of_20_tortured_women_executed_by_is_found/dsftgse/) comment.
t1_duwgy5p	1	*	I'm speaking from my own experiences. But that was a little over-exaggerated on my side... i apologize. I meant mostly European countries and politicians.
t1_dspny7s	0	*	There's a different view of Catholic priests and ministers abusing children? Please, tell us what you know...
t1_dslhstq	1	*	Middle America is called fly over country because theres nothing in the middle, basically the same deal as Australia

t1_dubhnaz	0	*	Do you know that Africa is quite a large landmass with a Huge variation of standards of living? For God's sake man, don't denigrate an entire continent.
t1_duv1wan	0	*	Yes, and the producer surplus that is lost is forgone income, not an actual transfer of money that the producer gives to the nation putting a tariff. Which, you know, is what Ive been telling you.
t1_duuvn30	1	*	No that's why she lost
t1_dusixqc	1	*	Didn't really insult him, just clarifying what he said. He genuinely said he wouldn't try to save 500 people by sacrificing himself. Sure people can do whatever they want but I'd kill him.

t1_dutmmtj	1	*	I can and I did. your right about Obama when you say he didn't start any war, he just made them allot bigger
t1_dul9thm	0	*	Thats not the point. Youre obs not getting it. Not gna waste my time on this. Just keep commenting and taking in the Karma on topics you know nothing about
t1_dv3g6pn	0	*	My argument is you shouldnt call something an invasion when it clearly isnt.
t1_dv2qpwy	0	*	I was going to base an argument on you being an American, but if you are not the argument wouldn't apply. Of course if you are Canadian or Australian it would.
t1_dv3lscp	1	*	I'm sorry you think people don't die in war. I hadn't realized that people did not know that. It just seemed obvious.
t1_dv390uq	0	*	I'm just going to assume you are a bully and try to using your overbearing manner to force people to agree with you.
t1_dv3dsyn	0	*	you're really wasting your time, i'm an estonian, i live in estonia. you gain nothing by converting me. btw, the soviets have killed and deported people in my family, so i know all about russia

t1_duwhv6m	0	*	Hardly any. Only about Trump, a single person.
t1_duwhu9w	0	*	I don't watch any Russian media. But when I read western media and what I read is obviously false, because I know what real life in Russia is like, I can't help but feel annoyed.

t1_dt7mppf	0	*	Sure, Ill still be here though xD
t1_dtaje1l	0	*	Comey who everyone called to be fired for mishandling the Clinton investigation? Yates who was fired for disobeying the President?

t1_dt85l86	1	*	The difference is you can't train diseases out of someone with treats.
t1_dtyzt35	0	*	I never claimed Poland was going to end up like Germany.  I dont know where you read that.  But Im glad you agree that banning Nazi worship is a problem.  
t1_dtythxu	0	*	That's your response to getting called out for supporting thought police in chief? 
t1_dtzbxfy	0	*	Why are you then using constructs that are so antifactual that they only persist in the US? 
t1_dtyedlo	0	*	It is my understanding that Zionism is predicated on conquest.
t1_dtwsz5q	0	*	The state of the American left has been dismal for so long that I'll gladly support Sanders' ideology while personally advocating for more radical change.

t1_dtwm69f	0	*	...
t1_dtwtgdf	0	*	Now that the country is there, the Jewish people who are actually there are entitled to their home. All the stuff about Law of Return and Birthright is some BS.
t1_dsqkzgs	0	*	Well now you're getting personal. Obviously you're not interested in an exchange of information, so I'll just leave you to your internet screeching about Jews.
t1_dsslnyt	0	*	And if a cop is found to have planted cocaine in your car you were still technically in possession of cocaine. Get over it - you're holding an illogical position.
t1_ds3eql3	0	*	But they can gladly run, or attack the current government, they just have to do it without demagoguery. 
t1_dsgacpr	0	*	Which is obviously not what Floopy meant since they've now changed their comment to say Midterms.
t1_dseccwg	0	*	The US govt has WAY too many secrets in my opinion. I know this is off topic but its something Im really passionate about and its why I got started in politics to begin with. 
t1_dsfdi0d	0	*	No answer huh? Just raging against America? I'm willing to bet there are more productive uses for all of that anger you have.

t1_dsm6uys	0	*	Yes, categorically so. Even liberal historians and academics don't dispute that. Do you have any idea what life was like BEFORE the revolution? Life was far worse under the former regimes.
t1_dse43kx	0	*	Austria, Iceland, Denmark.  But you're right my comment was pretty misleading.  But still the US is very far behind at 14

t1_dsucvi9	1	*	We agree then. I'm not claiming there's a better flag -- it's better to have a gruesome design like this than risk making someone offended.

t1_dsg6izv	0	*	Are you dense? The State Department doesn't run the drone program. That falls under the CIA.   The State Department runs programs like USAID and all the diplomatic outposts. 
t1_dsgo1ug	0	*	So you admit that the Fusion GPS findings and the Steele memo are the genuine article and were produced in good faith? Glad to hear, since it certainly seemed as if you were suggesting the opposite.

t1_dsgd2lf	1	*	No.
t1_dsh3dum	1	*	Right. We should focus our rage with the system which allows injustice. Participants (including our president) in the system are the victims too.   We need humanity and reconciliation. 
t1_dsgejp5	1	*	Hear hear
t1_dsh9et6	1	*	Something can be said for the idiots that didn't vote. Republicans voted in roughly the same numbers in 2008, 2012 & 2016. Democrats, not so much.

t1_dtnimn9	1	*	Yes Steele. Yes the same dossier. Its all in the testimony Feinstein released. 
t1_dtn9bbt	0	*	Except that those sources you mentioned did not provide enough evidence alone to get FISA warrant. It says that no FISA warrant would have been granted without the dossier.
t1_dtn1xu0	0	*	There is very little proof given that it would of been renewed otherwise.  Right now the FBI basically got caught planting drugs on a mob boss

t1_du2zmxl	1	*	Critical thinking  perfection.   You don't have to be perfect to critically think. Critical thinking should be the norm that we expect from each other, and not made to seem like it's unobtainable.  
t1_dt1gwvi	0	*	Like how they saw roy Moore win and trump lose.
t1_dup24ro	1	*	That seems to contradict what you previously claimed. And doesn't answers the question for an source and instead puts up even more claims without any backing.

t1_duamxgw	0	*	What issues do you have with UN watch? 
t1_dv0uw72	1	*	That can't be right, I heard about school shootings almost every day, must be fake news. /s
t1_dv1xw34	0	*	Because people would rather nit pick definitions and or what gun deaths actually count as gun deaths.  This nation is fucking stupid.

t1_dv1ker9	0	*	Lol I mopped that ass and now you're just repeating yourself. Peace. 
t1_dv0u3ck	1	*	It can be good if regulated and monitored correctly. Without regulation and proper monitoring, you end up with Title 2.
t1_dv0uc92	0	*	Could you clarify what point youre making?Im having trouble understanding, thanks
t1_dv17h2g	1	*	Too many farmers for specific products across the whole of the EU.  Not necessarily too many farmers.

t1_dv113cf	1	*	A casualty is someone who was killed or injured
t1_dulpfbz	1	*	No, NK's reps were thrilled for the photo ops and propoganda they can spread to the people. Go take a history/politics class or read a book on NK and you'll understand.
t1_dul7a7h	1	*	Yawn.
t1_duhjixb	1	*	That's pedantic. You forgot to include the Earth's  proximity to the sun.
t1_du1c3hm	0	*	They should be dismissed though. They literally voted trump into office because their minds were easily influenced by an old racist white guy.  He appealed to their idiocy and bigotry.
t1_du1fegc	1	*	I wrote it.
t1_dswtvmd	0	*	No? He didn't say or imply that lol and neither is that the point pro-refugee advocates make. You're fighting strawmen here

t1_ds44jes	1	*	Indeed this is the opinion of almost every reddit user. 
t1_ds49flt	0	*	You said: Whites voted for Trump.   That's a statement.   I said the same, I just changed one word. Your argument is just as pathetic as mine, if I ever made an argument.
t1_ds4ibzf	0	*	Now I know you're just fucking with me. The Nazis' directed efforts against Jews did not make them racist? OK.
t1_ds4ehu7	1	*	tomuh...
t1_dsc2sul	0	*	Nah, the work commute doesn't need a car. Flying to a different country for a conference does require a flight though.
t1_dsc89ym	1	*	I don't know what you're basing it on then.  On paper San Jose is light years safer than most American major cities, and on the ground it's very evident that that's the case.
t1_dunjlxv	0	*	Oh, I know that. That's why the stereotype of the american is being dumb as fuck.
t1_dv1u3my	0	*	I've got a GED to get first, but I'll definitely be looking into this. What is your daily work like?
t1_dvhpvqb	1	*	Trump still wants to over extend Americas military might though. Trump just wants everything to be america first. That of course has some benefits and some downsides. 
t1_dv24zcc	1	*	I have tried batch 10, 11, single barrel and new year. Batch 11 is my favorite. Runs $80-$90 for the regular ones.
t1_dv22o31	0	*	Yeeeeeah, nah. 
t1_dv1ybph	1	*	Okay well if you want to just punish every state that went red in the 2016 election, then it's only gonna help him get reelected. Maybe try applying your anger in ways that aren't counter-productive. 
t1_dv1qq80	0	*	You can argue that the law is needed all you want, but it won't change the fact that his voters would hate him if it passed. It would pretty much destroy his chances of winning. 
t1_dv24xlf	0	*	Completely fair assumptions of the state. I'm proud to be one of the votes against the pedophile.
t1_dv1tzri	1	*	If someone voted for a moron because people kept calling them a moron, maybe those people were right.

t1_dt0i6pj	1	*	Idk man. The Geneva convention and the declaration for human rights disagree.
t1_dt0inyx	0	*	>She still killed a person, though. That kind of thing doesn't go unpunished  So did the state. That's exactly why we should avoid killing if possible.  
t1_dt0r0zy	1	*	Yes, but did she deserve the death penalty for that?
t1_duga7xq	1	*	We know critical thinking might be hard, we know. You don't have to worry about any of this though, our like smart and really stable genius president has got it covered.
t1_dugds2z	0	*	the difference between me and a nation is enormous, but you know that and you're just being intellectually dishonest.

t1_du0cnj2	1	*	Thats what he is trying to tell me, yes. Thats the way I read it.   Only trying to point out the hypocrisy in what was said. 
t1_du08evz	1	*	The why is in the consensus. We do it because we live in a community.
t1_dtzmkri	0	*	I'd prefer if legislators listen exclusively to their constituents, equally, regardless of income or education level.  That is their job as I see it, and not the system we have in place currently. 
t1_dtzsc58	0	*	Good. You need to stop this, you're completely out of bounds. STOP IT
t1_dtzyy01	0	*	What? No, I didn't say it is irrelevant. I'm asking you to explain how it *is* relevant. It very well may be that it is completely relevant, but until you elaborate on it, I fail to see how.

t1_dtzlvql	0	*	Thanks, but just saying you think it's easy to understand doesn't help me understand it.
t1_dtzu84y	0	*	Empathy doesn't mean automatically agreeing with literally everyone. Empathy for the victim is why I dislike rapists. I don't know why this concept is so hard for you to grasp.
t1_du0iyr1	0	*	When harvesting plants you are causing them physical damage so you are then by your given definition harming the plants. Why would you do such a thing? Harming innocent life forms.

t1_dtob7pl	0	*	It's not an opinion, as the memo is being referenced to what actually happened. that's a factual reference. You find it cringey, because your mind can't wrap around simple logic. 
t1_dtni716	1	*	The point you were making is valid and correct, I was just saying, it's not 1/2 of the country.
t1_dtnngrf	0	*	> Who's side are they on?   The non-globalists, since they've watched the American middle class get transferred overseas over the last 20 years thanks to globalism.

t1_dsz6duy	1	*	Good points.  Our political situation reflects our economic one and vice-versa
t1_dsz325u	0	*	Technically, yes. We just collectively agree that's a requirement. I can't get behind forcing doctors to treat people at the will of the government. That's slavery that doesn't wash.
t1_dszaa2a	0	*	Compared to the rest of the world they aren't, in America they are. Even lower class Americans still make more money than about 90% of the world

t1_dud7fc9	0	*	Precisely zero that actually implicates trump. The indictments on manafort were for money laundering shit he did *before* he was on the trump campaign - except for one of the charges. 
t1_dud9xin	0	*	Watch the video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQI9RS9333c  He says she is unqualified for supporting the iraq war and taking pac money.  
t1_dudabn1	1	*	Ahh so you have no reply other than to insult others when called out. Quality reply right here. You are in the idiot category.
t1_dv0b8pb	1	*	You are really frighteningly obsessed, aren't you?  I suggest you get help, my love.   My criticisms shouldn't create this much of a reaction in you. I'm a bit worried for you, actually.  Poor thing.
t1_dudf0mg	0	*	I agree.  Freedom of speech is hugely important.  I'm just pointing out that it can be easily manipulated by our enemies as well.  It's best to know and understand our potential weaknesses.
t1_dudfodg	0	*	I have no idea what you just said.       -?
t1_dub35fl	0	*	You actually believe impeaching a fascist is destroying the country?
t1_duamvmi	1	*	Who cares? I never asked.   You're acting like a smartass when your posts aren't perfectly understandable.
t1_du9bj8v	0	*	It's actually rare that an inventor becomes rich from their inventions. People who control capital profit from inventions.
t1_dsjl33k	0	*	That has nothing at all to do with my point. Historically. That was his goal. He could *still* be one. Well, he can't because you know, Brexit. 
t1_duusgu6	1	*	Because thats what the conversation is about. People sometimes have conversations about topics that dont matter in the grand scheme of things.

t1_dt7xelr	1	*	Her party got the most votes in the election and is the only one that has a chance of forming a majority coalition. So yeah, she's on pretty solid footing to be Kanzlerin for a fourth term.
t1_dt6fk0g	0	*	Then U push those potential allies away. Tell me how do feel about Chinese military bases in the meditrain?  Incometance? U are kidding right pls show me how the maldives would fight against the uk?
t1_dtej78v	0	*	Mind your own business
t1_du74ug6	1	*	US prisons are awful places that just breed more criminals than they reform them.  Because we stuff our prisons full of people who really don't belong there alongside people who do.  
t1_dues913	1	*	If they have tiered pricing, that is most certainly not true for businesses. Price per kilowatt hour for a lot of places beyond 1000 kilowatt hour is more than the cost of solar cells.
t1_ds5cd2a	1	*	Yeah. I would say though you do have to lose some battles. Bannon is someone not to be underestimated.
t1_ds5ug1k	1	*	I'm glowing with love for everyone in this thread. 
t1_dsn7a01	0	*	Wow I really offended you. For the record I am also really into skincare and use cruelty free products.
t1_dt9v7wq	1	*	Quebec does indeed have people who are employed to police matters of language. Their central task is to visit shops and report back to their headquarters so that fines can be sent to establishments.
t1_dthamp2	0	*	Yeah but these studies are usually targeted at specific things. They would need a separate study to look at US oligarchs. 
t1_ds4k4ws	1	*	No worries :D 
t1_dv3gloc	1	*	Nah. That guy is right. He's a fucking idiot.

t1_dv3dn2u	0	*	>Said the person with a fragile male ego?  Yeah, I did that, not you people.
t1_dv3jtuf	1	*	so you are also in favor all the comments Trump made this week about taking guns from people and banning sales for those under 21 and having no guns bought without background checks for all ?
t1_dv36d0g	0	*	How does that prevent future meddling by Russians in elections?
t1_dv3c4g5	1	*	Perfect, and its the Italian prime minister
t1_dv3s86f	0	*	Where did I make excuses? My point is still relevant when you take his entire statement into context, not just what you choose.
t1_dv3gex9	1	*	Most refugees the United States deals with are from the El Salvador Civil War, but even if he's comparing Syrian refugees, it's a horrible comparison  
t1_dv4pibi	1	*	Goalpost moving (as displayed here) is a key tactic used by team treason to keep their followers. You know, like a cult does.
t1_dv3iosk	1	*	Antifa hasn't killed anyone So you're lying.
t1_dv37f7s	0	*	no one can own a lake house? why does that even matter? I have a lake house(in the family)  Anyway, she didn't win, after repeated polls showed sanders was stronger candidate against trump. 
t1_dv3bizm	1	*	I literally just said that my parent commenter is insecure, because he/she is.  It's pretty unfortunate that they have to put down others the way they do.
t1_dv41k24	1	*	Yup, I'm really putting down others by insulting them in every comment on the internet.  Nobody has done that to me in this thread.
t1_dvwxe0p	0	*	So what you're saying is having a nearly trillion dollar trade deficit per year is a good thing.   Got it.
t1_dtah26y	1	*	> Sorry, I forgot that HISTORY is the true static record of the past.  Did I say it was... 
t1_dt5els3	0	*	Just going by data.
t1_dt5yioz	0	*	I'm not sure what you're trying to prove by linking that, because it never said anything about Lincoln ever owning slaves at any point.
t1_dspv7i4	1	*	You're right about the credible sources, but Palestinian sources don't even compare to Israeli ones
t1_duioblr	0	*	As soon as refugees enter the EU, they are generally distributed between the member states.   As otherwise greece would have to care for a huge amount of people.   
t1_ducve40	0	*	Button down that flapping upper lip of yours, goofy, before I staple it to the ceiling and watch you spin around like a fart-powered ceiling fan.
t1_dsf2dsd	0	*	yeah, if the law protecting you is enforced then you have no reason to start a campaign, unless white people lose all control of discrimination law enforcement it's useless
t1_dsf6vh0	1	*	I can demonstrate you're talking out your arse by illustrating that you won't be able to come up with the document that gives evidence for this allegation.
t1_dsf5nud	0	*	A bunch? That's not really a good value to go by. Why aren't they speaking out anonymously?
t1_dtrpa4z	0	*	So, can we see it?
t1_dtrwsmb	0	*	I've agreed with much of your commentary on Walmart but you've gone off the rails here. 
t1_dtrps10	0	*	Maybe english is not his first language? Anyway, the point here is, if you substood what he said in the first place, why make a teacher-like remark?
t1_dtroiyf	0	*	Because you have problems with reading comprehension. Must be Walmarts fault, too.
t1_dtrfrqh	1	*	13-15 were the Wal-Mart years. There was not much to do. The Arbys parking lot was also a very hot spot.
t1_dtsafu3	1	*	I get that sometimes too, and its kind of funny.  Yall have my number, I didnt die, Im pretty easy to get ahold of
t1_dubu14n	0	*	Where you from? Rzeszxf3w native here. Maybe the tracksuits are popular in other areas and I'm just being ignorant. Haven't seen them in style since the late 90s-early 00s.
t1_dubr0gx	1	*	Tellin' you which subreddit to go to and what to believe.
t1_dubpgdc	0	*	I agree, grasping when it's not worth your time to argue with people about things that simply have no verifiable facts to back them is healthy.
t1_dtm0qp5	1	*	Carl Lewis has been vegan for a long time now.  That's one right off the top of my head.  He says it's helped him tremendously.
t1_dtlmzfz	1	*	I can believe this for things like partisanship, but evolution-denying is probably not Russian propaganda.

t1_dtlfc2t	1	*	I've seen a case of toe-foot turn into knee-leg in less than a week.
t1_dtr1xud	1	*	Drowning them in a delicious sauce would defeat the purpose, and I'm pretty sure no one has ever invented a veggie burger that doesn't taste like ass.

t1_dst5625	1	*	Sadly they don't their egos are too big
t1_dsmqyeu	1	*	Nobody thinks he invented it.  He repopularised it though
t1_dthsgtx	0	*	Nope. Too much evidence.  McCarthy didn't have evidence, and his victims' crimes, if they existed at all, were ideological. This isn't McCarthyism, and you better choose your side wisely, mfr
t1_dth873r	0	*	I'm not saying it's likely, im saying that's what we should do. But I'm not in favor of well the govt is going to keep spending anyway so we might as well just take more money from the taxpayers 
t1_dth0i89	0	*	Either way, just clarifying that you cant tell people the but Obama excuse doesnt work in this particular case. It does.   And it hurts your/our case to be hypocritical like this. 
t1_dthgnp6	0	*	Oui enfin il y avait aussi plein de gens pour le CPE.  Trump est un gros con mais je trouve la situation tout a fait comparable. 
t1_dtgkln2	1	*	We have bigger problems. For sure.
t1_dtgjtmh	1	*	Good boy, you sure showed us your superiority!
t1_dth8h2m	0	*	Ive got no way of knowing. Terrifying, isnt it? Nixon resigned rather than test it. Do you think Trump would?
t1_dth7h2o	0	*	Why won't you answer?

t1_dtw2ksu	1	*	I don't know why but this made me tear up a bit. Pink Floyd has been absolutely instrumental in defining what kinds of music I really appreciate.
t1_dtzpdi4	1	*	Existing in the office without repairing his stance is negative. Not sure what you aren't getting. Also he's done plenty of negative shit as VP.
t1_du07p28	1	*	True, but they should be.
t1_dsg110j	0	*	How can you not care about unnecessary suffering on such a grand scale? I mean it's not as if this just affects animals, it greatly affects humans too.

t1_ds8939k	0	*	I don't, I just wanted to point out that making a ton of money doesn't automatically makes somebody a greedy asshole.  That's a decision you make for yourself. 
t1_ds3p6ej	0	*	> State or county calls  Funny, I used to work in IP and corporate law, and never heard of state or county calls.

t1_dssbqgo	1	*	What? I mean, that's right, but so what?
t1_dsstdaw	1	*	Probably minted and sent out in sequential bills. Or crack money. It's a black budget; it's not supposed to be accounted for.
t1_dulp6js	1	*	More like being high alters your mental state. The changes aren't permanent so there isn't actual brain damage.  Alcohol on the other hand causes actual permanent brain damage in the form of dementia.
t1_dteyno7	0	*	> Maybe leave the basement and meet some actual people next time then.  Thanks for the discussion.  All the best.
t1_dthjiq0	0	*	If in pre-Islamic Arabia, women had no rights, then how did Khadija become one of the most influential figures in Mecca?

t1_dtf8m63	1	*	Straw man fallacy, not all women, but many aren't as useful as they can be if they were educated. Miss me with that fallacy shit
t1_dtez76c	0	*	Yeah but you have to do some research before judging an entire religion about something you heard somewhere plus i don't know what's the hadith is
t1_du403gj	0	*	I'm not sure why you say that bit about taxing the poor. The current congress lowered everyone's taxes.
t1_du2baxc	0	*	Having a bank account by itself won't initiate a report, you need to have a credit card or open a loan and temporary jobs(<1yr) won't report either.
t1_dsewrio	1	*	> i stay out of it  you don't seem to be staying out of it really though, do you? you seem to be expressing an opinion on the matter, which is the direct opposite to staying out.

t1_dsbzyh1	0	*	Do, u deny what happened in the congo?

t1_dt22zsz	0	*	Have you looked at what Bill Gates has done with his money in the last two decades? What you are arguing is uninformed nonsense stated as fact, which is worse.
t1_dt1wc7t	0	*	Darknet? It's the solution (pun intended) for nicotine (for vaping) in places where prohibition on it exists. No idea what's available for cigs or loose leaf, but there's gotta be something.
t1_dt2kzi7	1	*	Sure, but there's zero obligation to not try and have the best life for one's self. Why is there an expectation for people to work then give it up?
t1_dt1tuhx	0	*	I don't care about reddit, it's a shitty site and I hope for the day when it shuts down just like happened with digg after it became shitty and everyone moved to reddit.
t1_dsgvcwt	1	*	Time will tell. Geo-politics changes day by day. 
t1_dsmpr9j	1	*	It's a legitimate question. Being from a shitty country doesn't make you more useful to America. It doesn't make you a worse candidate in and of itself, but it doesn't count in your favor either. 
t1_dug95yp	1	*	I hope you have a great day as well. Take care. 
t1_dsldi7p	0	*	Why would you 'wire' money to someone and pay 30 dollars for it? Why wouldn't you just transfer the money directly from your bank account to theirs?

t1_dtg7tdi	1	*	Ahh how could I be so blind. Im sorry for not considering this please accept my apology. 
t1_dtg74i2	1	*	You're free to explain how it isn't.  Inequal roles within governments and organisations is hardly exclusive to the EU. If you think it is, you're woefully ignorant.
t1_dtkiz7d	1	*	I see, wasn't sure the context.
t1_duff5al	0	*	Apparently you're too angry to have any level of reading comprehension.
t1_dsjbvkq	0	*	The other 44 have probably been involved in some shit too. I just don't want to lost them all considering you're just going to use it as an excuse to somehow turn blame back to the US. 
t1_du5n68x	0	*	Okay, then you agree that evil people's deaths should be celebrated. The fuck? Your previous comments are all about how good people shouldn't do that
t1_dtdq4ok	0	*	Maybe you're right about Navalny...but come on...you think Putin is not killing his enemies??

t1_duca0zx	0	*	So the answer is yes the British people have a voice. That means it isn't a foreign government
t1_ds3fmya	0	*	Unity I'd easier to achieve when everyone looks and thinks the same. A racial diverse society is a permenantly fractured society.

t1_dstkfjm	0	*	Thank you so much. No further questions :-)
t1_dsuwp14	1	*	Wow, thank you so much!  I had no idea it took so much time, it makes sense of course but it makes sense for everyone to focus on the 25th amendment, rather than introduce the 34th right now :-)
t1_dsu7n4q	0	*	You are right, I suppose that was sort of dumb of me. 
t1_dspiirn	1	*	I seem to remember that the case originally happened around the same time as The Fappening, so late 2014'ish.  Facebook alerted the danish police about the sharing of the videos around 1 year ago.
t1_dsphjw3	0	*	There is no crime that gets you 20 years of prison in Denmark. 
t1_dv33lgv	1	*	It's not that we are deliberately murdering them, it's what happens in terms of collateral damage when you are bombing urban areas
t1_dtl5rfk	0	*	Well in that case it is the best state.  Social healthcare and all  Also the USA fucked with canada once and we burned down you white house.   The USA won't touch canada, we have to many allies.

t1_duarfsw	0	*	Beggars can't be choosers. That goes for both Israel and Palestine.
t1_dudaxu9	0	*	And again, *I'm not anti-gun.* I'm pro-standardized gun laws and proper training. Hell, I think gun safety should be a standard part of public education, possibly as part of health courses.
t1_dsr6erd	1	*	This after insulting me multiple times.  Kinda proves that you're not withholding information since you can't withhold something you don't have.

t1_dsmhi7n	0	*	You mean Voldemort? Yeah he's likely going to run for Senate so he might be everyone's problem soon. Bill Nelson is a well loved senior senator though so hopefully not, we'll see.
t1_dsnikt0	1	*	Third world = not aligned with tbe American West or Soviet USSR. Russia is by definition EXACTLY second world. 
t1_dsmmgn2	0	*	That is a TON of assumptions you made. And what the fuck do you mean by your kind? Try reading your own name and think about how that impacts you.

t1_ds1hz8r	0	*	That has absolutely nothing to do with politological  issues we were discussing.  We're done here since you're too stupid to be able to grasp the fundamental definitions and use them correctly.
t1_ds2ra99	1	*	If you say so.
t1_ds13rmd	0	*	You seem pretty upset.  Must be scary not to have false equivalencies to hide behind.   
t1_ds6ivst	0	*	And what if they get it? Why wouldn't the loser argue that 60% is too low for such a landmark vote, and you actually need 65% of the votes.
t1_duz51ww	0	*	also this banned russian thing looks like a hate sub, i am not a fan of spreading hatred about other cultures. 
t1_ds8c7d9	1	*	I haven't brought up child labor at all.  I'm talking about the cost involved in fueling our lives.  
t1_dt9grxf	1	*	LOL, look at the commenters name...
t1_dt9kml2	0	*	Do you have a source of a made up sourceless article they havent retracted/corrected?
t1_dt9thns	1	*	All men must serve unless they have bone spurs
t1_dt9p7lx	0	*	The best they have is Fast & Furious ... which didn't work out like they'd hoped, but it's not clear any actual crime was committed.
t1_dt9bsau	1	*	Oh, I enjoy it. His post will be downvoted to oblivion anyway. The way I see it, I'm occupying time he could be spending posting upthread somewhere more noticeable.
t1_dta8kze	0	*	you looney lefties are a waste of time. you'll understand when you grow up
t1_dtbf1bc	0	*	No it doesn't put it in conflict and it is the dumb ones - rejectors of science, embracers of open and coded racism and more. Stop with the conspiracy mindset demagogues thrive on it 
t1_dt9iy4k	1	*	Omg thats the worst kind of Muslims!   /s
t1_dt9f6e9	1	*	You bet, guy. Happy trails.
t1_dtds5vp	0	*	Why are so so fixated on the idea that I think Donald trump is the only thing wrong in American Government?
t1_dtb989f	0	*	You don't get to decide that another human being isn't a life.  First, it's scientifically  wrong.   Second, it's evil discrimination. 
t1_dtcrufm	0	*	Republicans have already destroyed net neutrality. Dems want better accountability and background checks, not to destroy your rights. Why are you exaggerating the Dem's position?  
t1_ds33zfu	1	*	Yes but it could have been worked out.
t1_duohjen	0	*	It's time to stop wasting my time.
t1_dtqjtb8	1	*	Damn if it's that good, I may as well take a plane trip over to London one of these days. No need to wait til I'm 21 there.
t1_dth8fti	0	*	By that same logic all non indigenous populations should pack up and become refugees. Australia, North America, Central America, South America, etc.
t1_dukcfrb	1	*	Lol whatever 
t1_dsez2zm	0	*	Because despite what people say, as a society we still believe sex is something more than what it is.  I don't. Once you learn what biologically happens, all the magic disappears. 
t1_du6bo51	1	*	Silly goose. The topic here was people choosing EU over US and you complaining about poeple criticising the US.
t1_dujmun5	0	*	for someone who called me a bigot you sure are antisemitic.
t1_dv10x9p	1	*	Clearly. I do not understand how you can let this happen to your country where people cant walk down the street anymore. I cant comprehend how that is ok for Germans but hey, its their country. 
t1_dtotcs4	0	*	I edited my comment to say christian*. I feel like the debate is only on because only 16% of the earths population does not believe in any deities.
t1_dsp8ih9	1	*	I can and do defend it. I just recognize Reddit comments as the wrong time and place. 
t1_dsjiuxj	0	*	Public opinion should not dictate who we jail, only the law should do that. You shouldn't be jailing people just becuase you feel negatively about them.
t1_dsizhkl	1	*	I *knew* it was a pyramid scheme...
t1_dsiua5f	1	*	except Trump won the election, not the popular vote.   edit: it's the same if you voted blue in a blue state, your vote didn't count, but at least your state still pledged its EC votes to Clinton.
t1_du4xi24	1	*	Id rather have people openly out themselves as Nazis so law enforcement can keep an eye on them.  Banning things just takes it underground and thats more worrying.  
t1_dtq1k0z	1	*	well said
t1_du1v5oi	0	*	> The tax bill modifies state tax rules because they're allowed to do that.  No it doesn't. And no they are not allowed to do that. Thanks for understanding dual sovereignty.
t1_dui5ibm	0	*	Yeah they are, and I originally came here from Digg when they did Version 3.0 and everyone left.   Fuck, I'm getting too old for this shit. 
t1_ds67mqa	0	*	Because if you import more and export less it reduces Aggregate Demand, which is a contributing factor to Growth. 
t1_ds6dr5r	1	*	I dunno man, if you don't reference Tuvalu at least twice, it's all kind of irrelevant to the discussion.
t1_dsa7irb	0	*	Huh, what? Can you cite your sources?
t1_duz8hyc	0	*	I can agree with you that it is Turkey's fault the conflict started.  But it is the Kurds' fault the conflict continues.
t1_du2m4kf	1	*	Because both countries are legally allowed under international law to conduct military actions against each other.
t1_dth1zef	0	*	You know both people from minorities und people that want to get rid of minorities? Sorry, but I have no sympathy for the second group.
t1_dto5jlp	1	*	im not bothered about weather its a British or Indian car, thats just branding. Im more bothered about where the profits, and therefore tax revenue, go. 
t1_dtnb5mq	1	*	I could have name BP, which sells oil, or HSBC which is worldwide now, even cigarettes, it can really be anything that you country make
t1_dt969fl	1	*	Then the IDF will keep bombing, they have pretty much everything they want here.
t1_ducld2g	0	*	No, I'm not. And your continued effort to try and make me feel guilty for such things just makes me less inclined to want to help there.
t1_dsxos6g	0	*	Yeah the things your saying just dont work that way. You can keep saying them, but thats not how it works
t1_dswvl2d	0	*	sweet now you can shut up and read the thread you are commenting on that has nothing to do with parenting 
t1_duvypwy	1	*	Why did you reply to me? I'm not debating whether or they did. I know they did
t1_dszn0t1	0	*	So how does he secretly support their agenda?
t1_dszgwvn	1	*	You can't even begin to understand how an increase in the cost of labour will lead to a decrease in profits if other factors are not changed? That says quite a bit about your economic understanding.
t1_dskzrxy	1	*	Ah, sorry, you'd have to compete with these two charming chihuahuas we already have.  :-/  Things will get better.
t1_dska1ig	1	*	You assumed we were associating you with them friend.
t1_dsju5pz	1	*	Ding ding ding.  He keeps listing individual personal failings when we're discussing parties, not individuals. 
t1_dsjbmw5	0	*	You arent wrong but in literally every single good for the average person vote its split in party lines with the GOP voting special interests every time. 
t1_dsjjcj2	0	*	To add to this, its proven Democratics lower the abortion rates while republicans higher it lol. So voting republican is voting for MORE abortions
t1_dsjkego	0	*	Holy. Shit.  You guys do not listen. I dont like Donald Trump. I dont like Republicans. 
t1_dsjibm0	1	*	Sounds like you need to do some reading.  http://www.letmegooglethat.com/?q=fox+news+no+go+zones
t1_dsjfhba	0	*	All 3 of those countries have leftist governments in power at this time.
t1_dsjcntb	1	*	thank you for your interjection of anti generalization and fair handed bipartisan criticism
t1_dsjg3js	0	*	I don't even live there with you guys and that's dragging *me* down, mate.  I suppose it doesn't matter much in your everyday live, does it?
t1_dsjbk48	1	*	I cant vote. Im on the whim of yall. 
t1_dsjok12	0	*	ooo that sounds nice. But i'd rather not be the meat :p

t1_ds7gg97	0	*	> It's essentially the same side effects you would get from drinking caffeine.   No, it's completely different. This is basic physiology.
t1_du35kwo	0	*	I know youre an idiot.
t1_du0i5gz	0	*	You have made multiple posts talking about being in Canada or being a Canadian, so I guess that just makes you a lying canadiansplainer. 
t1_dsr133p	0	*	I'm neutral. I could take it or leave it.
t1_dv43q5s	1	*	Aren't we all, maaaan?
t1_durfyb2	0	*	No. Its implying that American adults are too Fucking stupid to do anything about it.   
t1_durb0lm	0	*	Just want to point out that you guys are wasting time arguing with some teenager based on all the video game subreddits he posts in. 
t1_dur764p	0	*	Interesting because when I put 350000000/7000 in my calculator it comes out to .00002%
t1_durogwh	1	*	I'm in 3-4 states a week
t1_dusuxet	1	*	It also forces some degree of positive campaigning. You can't paint 6 other parties as lotteraly Satan the way you can a monolithic opposition.
t1_dusjt6m	1	*	You need schools to have school shootings
t1_dush1wl	0	*	If you recall.....?  Firstly, Google. Secondly, how the fuck don't you know that.
t1_dv10t73	0	*	And I hope, someday, you may learn the difference between false conspiracies and reality. Best!
t1_dt1w3hf	0	*	Ok.  Then what exactly are you trying to stop?  
t1_dui2kta	1	*	Yeah and part of the problem there is that the city often expects back taxes on those houses.  Suddenly your $10 house becomes a $10k house, and all of that is due up front.
t1_dui2pp5	0	*	Sorry, meant rich 1%, not conservatives in general.
t1_dui2lu6	1	*	Dunno if you're UK/US, but the Iron Lady did her union-busting bit as well.
t1_dui61jx	1	*	thanks, was having the hardest time googling for this lmao

t1_dui2i9g	0	*	Implying women don't have an effect on the workforce? Get outta here with that sexist bs
t1_dui7eak	1	*	That must be net income, not gross income.
t1_dui28vg	1	*	I don't mean human trafficking, I mean slavery. No cute words or technicalities. I'm talking about institutional slavery, which no longer exists in the vast majority of modern countries and peoples.
t1_dui7oi8	0	*	I'd like to see them try texting after they've lost half their little fingers to industrial accidents!
t1_dtvbqs5	0	*	lol--like when you enforced it by ethnically cleansing Algeria, for example?
t1_dttctp0	1	*	Oh cool. Shouldn't surprise me much, though. Israel and the US work together a lot. Especially when it comes to anything military-related.
t1_dtsxj9s	0	*	South Asia is not a country though, so Indonesia is the largest muslim country by population
t1_dujn40q	1	*	It makes sense now that you explained it :D
t1_dsekjzo	1	*	I'm not sure which one you're calling peace time.  Bush was for a year iirc.
t1_dsew1pl	1	*	I think the argument could be made for Eisenhower 
t1_dseq9mi	0	*	That was the Cold War.  Donnou how much credit you want to give him for arming Afghanistan, that program didn't really pick up till Regan.
t1_dsfm6i8	0	*	Spamming is against Reddit's rules.
t1_dsew7t9	0	*	What? They're reviving Stargate?   I am both slightly pleased and moderately horrified, given the meandering mess that was **Stargate Universe**.
t1_dsto9pr	0	*	 Did you just quote Wikipedia at me?!  Hahahaha   Get out of here with that crap.
t1_ds67r55	0	*	So, that means you are not going to call out OP for doing a far more explicit version of what you are accusing me of doing?  Just to be really clear here?
t1_dv6i5fb	0	*	Gosh. You really can't let go of this, lol.  Just more evidence, Nyet Nyet. 
t1_dunesy7	1	*	Could be worse, and thanks!
t1_dttryyy	0	*	So, you have no evidence and you reject mine because it goes against your narrative. Good to know. 
t1_dtv52s3	1	*	What is that a response to? I don't understand your comment
t1_dtttpiz	0	*	To me that reads like this:  I'm right, and they're wrong, and if they don't admit they're wrong, then they're even more wrong
t1_ds7uqnt	0	*	No way dude, a bunch of back country fucks with 50 year old 2nd hand guns/artillary and improvised bombs can totally use a Nuke.
t1_dsa0rie	0	*	Why?
t1_duixh6q	0	*	Unlike you, I've actually spoken to people. More than one. They all told me the same thing: It made no difference.  I've also read studies, which are easy to find.  But you live in your bubble......
t1_dung52x	1	*	Thank you. Dictionary.com works. The definition loosely supports you but other definitions do not.
t1_dukvsiu	0	*	Do you have any surveys backing that up? And the comparison to FGM is usually only made by activists.
t1_duizzxk	0	*	S'alright, I'll still credit you if only for the username.
t1_duen0rw	1	*	My pleasure
t1_dv0l5dn	1	*	I would gladly do that, for me the weapon hoarding of the far-right is a much bigger concern than the government. 
t1_duz38ot	0	*	You're going to get funded and equipped by Russia and have years of experience fighting an occupying force? Well sure, that changes everything then.

t1_dtm2a3o	1	*	Awwww are you mad because Trump is letting the country have the rebound it should have under Obama? What an interesting life you must live under that tin foil hat. 
t1_dtfl5hq	0	*	> we even survived brexit  Dude, that's next year.

t1_dtaodwr	0	*	But yours are big and mean, ours are cute and small and funny looking! I honestly had no idea that we eat ours here as well...
t1_dta5wff	0	*	>Words can't hurt people.  Are you serious? Were you never hurt by anything someone swid to you? Then you're a quite unusual person.
t1_dtc842x	1	*	Right but you must understand that many people who are charged or cited by police think their charges or citations are bullshit.
t1_dta3a1w	1	*	Yeah, but fact are nice; because they're facts.
t1_dtbd4cc	0	*	Your laws don't protect free speech if speech that people don't want to hear is not protected. That's what free speech *is*. Calling somebody a Nazi doesn't violate their rights. 
t1_dtay7mf	0	*	How did you just jumped to this?
t1_dteiv5e	0	*	Once again, no refutation of any of my points. I'll take that as you having extreme cognitive dissonance after being banged on by 100% irrefutable facts. U0001f618 xoxo, brainlet.
t1_dtarfsk	1	*	We still have smuggling concerns.
t1_dtaeuwc	0	*	Off topic, but is your username a Manics reference, by any chance?
t1_dtaftst	0	*	So provide a source for your fucking claims.
t1_dtc79tg	1	*	In self defense 
t1_dtitx6o	1	*	Another note: Bimbo is used the same way as Neger, calling somebody a Bimbo in Germany has a very heavy racial bias.
t1_dtcbhnd	1	*	And afterwards they have to go through a 3 year BA police degree in Hessen. 
t1_dtao0bm	1	*	Wunderbar
t1_dta8017	1	*	Wood table isnt neurotic as fuck.   Holy shit, youre right, it is easy! 
t1_dt9q3hz	1	*	Notice you didn't bother to say where you're from. Worried about what people might point out that you don't want to hear?
t1_dypfp1d	1	*	You would need to be fluent in German though and studying medicine is reserved for the absolute top students.
t1_dszumvq	1	*	Yeah my sex Ed class wasn't anti abortion at all lmao 
t1_dszu70j	0	*	>I know a lot with unstable families  Your personal experiences and observations are irrelevant.  You can't be this clueless

t1_dums3vf	1	*	Again, show me stats on gun deaths in those countries. Then compare them to us.
t1_ds1ug3q	0	*	So she is used by the armed forces? Are we reading the same sentence for goodness sake? 
t1_dt4mqws	0	*	US nuclear subs aren't taking territory  You really need to come to term with it, say no to imperialism instead of bragging about it.  disgusting
t1_du8jpq8	0	*	Firstly, the dark ages weren't literally dark. Secondly the affects of ash in the atmosphere won't be as bad as you assume it will be. There will still be sunlight.
t1_dt0h0s8	0	*	Yes your explanation was clear but you were also wrong. Sorry bud. Effective rate isn't what you think it is.
t1_duah0mh	0	*	It doesn't matter -- the point is Assange *had* info on Trump and decided not to release it. That means he was selectively publishing.
t1_duapqrr	1	*	Nope, I am not. Just looking for actual proof that the allegations are anything more than that. 
t1_duailv1	0	*	What *is* your main point then? That Clinton rigged the election by a process she had nothing to do with? You *are* aware that Bernie knew how the DNC functions, right? 
t1_duqe2gq	0	*	As in de facto
t1_duqlifk	0	*	Yup.
t1_duqh8tk	0	*	Sure, but I'm not going to give them, or anyone working with them a pass. And I'm going to defer to the professionals investigating this to see how the dice land.
t1_durvh3k	0	*	I am absolutely arguing in good faith.  You're the one making up arbitrary blanket terms and refusing to define them.  They, the media, you're basically just saying boogeymen
t1_duqdhtk	1	*	There there.
t1_duqgij3	1	*	LOL that's exactly what I felt :)
t1_duqb1c6	1	*	I googled titty sprinkles and was not disappointed.  And, no, I'm not leaving a link for the lazy.
t1_durf1sh	0	*	> Not socialist in action whatsoever.  refer to first comment
t1_dus6ing	1	*	It's had plenty of chances.  It's fortunate that it will never be tried on a large scale again.
t1_dur41zy	0	*	It is not socialism. Nordic model includes a combination of free market capitalismxa0with a comprehensive welfare statexa0andxa0collective bargainingxa0at the national level.
t1_durar82	0	*	Is it hard to type with the giant foam WE'RE  NUMBER ONE hands on?
t1_dureri4	0	*	And you're name calling? Wow, you really don't have a strong argument.
t1_dur9qkd	1	*	Okay youve mostly convinced me. You just made such a thorough point. Don't go around writing historical narratives when a specific rebuttal would be more effective.
t1_durc6op	1	*	People didn't get the reference :(
t1_durnj1b	0	*	not interested in playing semantic games
t1_dsfhga2	1	*	General sense among the populace that their country gave a shit if they were able to live is a big one.
t1_dspdnvt	0	*	What the fuck did he not take? Neither this nor your previous comment make any sense at all. His rebuttal was perfect.

t1_dskyr97	0	*	Ok mate, it was such a great joke
t1_dskqd1g	0	*	No, you're bigoted against people who don't agree with you. Intolerant might be a better word. You'd fit right in with the American left.
t1_dsktzp3	0	*	I'm not sure what hurt more , my alleged crucifixion ,or getting to close to your edge.   :(
t1_dsknjlv	1	*	I don't know.  I'm not informed on the situation in Norway, I was just trying to explain what it seemed like the other commentor was inferring. 
t1_dsktjhc	1	*	Sorry.  I'm just trying to figure out why everyone is arguing with me and assuming I'm saying people shouldn't be allowed in the US because the countries they're leaving are shitholes.
t1_dskvclo	1	*	[Lol](https://youtu.be/nCsM3iklq8Q)

t1_dsknmmp	0	*	How else was I supposed to explain that I agreed with it without including myself in my comment
t1_dsl65rp	0	*	No but it is pretty to call someone an illiterate if they cant read the things you wrote.   
t1_ds4udwj	1	*	Native Americans too, not to mention the multitude.
t1_dtma92u	1	*	His racist drivel wasn't written by enough grey matter to go that far in logic or thinking. Don't put pressure on him.
t1_du7ynzj	0	*	Yeah think that guys is forgetting all the Jews have done to make Israel theirs since the beginning of time.
t1_du77uog	0	*	> Nixon's actions with Cambodia were moral and correct,   lol please go on

t1_dsfypgn	0	*	I'll admit I don't know a lot about the khmer rouge to comment on them in that regard
t1_duvyvgj	0	*	Xi Jinping, with the backing of the people/state, recently removed the term limit, allowing him to stay in power indefinitely.  
t1_ds8gy0t	1	*	ok, if you say so
t1_dtpyuu5	0	*	I mean for the state as a self employed person 
t1_dsdsjz9	1	*	Lower suicide rates than America. If everyone commits suicide in the same place you either sell seats or try to prevent it.
t1_dsd2uj1	1	*	Thanks 
t1_dsxugg6	0	*	??
t1_dur3bip	0	*	I didn't say a thing about your qualities, but you just accused me of ad hominem attacks in the same sentence in which you disparage such behavior. There's a word for that.
t1_duyow6z	0	*	What did superdelegates have to do with the vote differential? 
t1_duyyj9d	0	*	Source?

t1_duym6dz	1	*	GOP considerably worse. 
t1_duyudfm	0	*	For someone that doesnt want to waste time because of Le Post History you sure are replying a lot and completely avoiding the topic. Are you ready to answer yet?
t1_duyvvrh	0	*	We're eager to see your sources, would you be so kind as to present them?    It'd be odd not to hear back from you seeing as how you spend a full 8hr period on reddit daily, almost like it's your job.
t1_duyj0hb	0	*	by supporting racism...shame on you leftie. at least i'm not hypocritical about it and holier than thou. lel
t1_duyn3bv	1	*	Or they dont let President Trump live in their heads rent free like you do. 
t1_duypugu	0	*	Time's up! Guess we aren't going to be reading that thesis of yours anytime soon eh?
t1_duz8wl4	1	*	Hilarious that you think Clinton being the DNCs primary fundraiser is a scandal. Next you'll be telling she was a party stalwart for 40 years. My god, the scandal! 
t1_dv1eehw	0	*	What the fuck are you talking about? *A LOT* has happened in the last 18 months. 
t1_dsxvp3t	0	*	Ah gaslighting, well done.   
t1_dsygdn7	1	*	Yeah its an autocorrect typo. I have full faith that you can use context to understand what I mean though.
t1_ds6noq5	0	*	I'll respect his opinion on this after he reads a book about Hamas. 
t1_du93ue3	0	*	You're embarrassing yourself. Learn to read. 
t1_du8tnqt	0	*	Okay. You're racist, that's for sure. I'm fine with it. All societies have their worst kind. But please don't sound this BS to me. I'm not interested in hearing your opinion. Thank you.
t1_dui5pqx	0	*	Ok, but what about people that dont want them to end?
t1_dv59hvn	1	*	It's adorable watching you guys from the White House. 
t1_dv50ahy	1	*	Nah, its on point. 
t1_dv5aqtl	1	*	Doesn't sound appetizing.  Must.be.rough.  Free viticulture classes.  Been up and down Ca too many times.  Love 1 except for narrow cliffy around big sur scares me.  
t1_dv501sh	1	*	And then accused you of not keeping up...
t1_du113gc	1	*	Same as if you do, only the rewards for my strategy succeeding are far better
t1_dsjxsjr	0	*	I'm not protecting him I'm calling you an asshole, because you are.

t1_dugzjoy	1	*	I see the problem. You think I'm someone else. Look at the names.
t1_dugz15u	0	*	That still doesn't constitute a definition of Cooperation, but rather just a way two nations could cooperate. Try again?
t1_dtqp9k8	1	*	I don't know there's a bunch. Just make sure you get loaded every night though and make it some liquor or something, maybe add some sugary mixer

t1_dsq1mcx	1	*	Good post
t1_dspvaks	0	*	That was satire mimicking the logic of your own argument, so if you think *that* was flawed then I've got bad news.
t1_dtu60w2	0	*	so how will they be able to track it?  i would have thought they needed some sort of directional antenna to send or receive a signal at that distance?  
t1_dsrzigo	0	*	It's disheartening that you couldn't comprehend that sentence. I'm clearly not calling the Nazis fine people. 
t1_dssiab3	1	*	I was on adderall  as a child so I can see the difference. 
t1_dssv9yu	1	*	Thanks there chief Ill get right to studyin!

t1_dsrpr4d	0	*	Sorry but that's counter revolutionary adventurism. 
t1_dsll59m	1	*	But again all started before Present Obama. Admittedly he could have done more and better but I cannot lay ALL of it on one man

t1_dslzp6h	0	*	This is like asking for proof that we have the Patriot Act or asking for proof that trespassing is illegal.
t1_dsl14ow	0	*	Thanks, dude. Still, I think I need to slow down and deliver more considered and intelligent commentary. Be the change... ya know?
t1_dslo7cl	1	*	I totally believe you and understand your side, its just hard to convey that message over text, especially when you phrase it that way.
t1_dsl9qjz	0	*	Well I'm tolerant of people of different races and cultures, you know, things that are a result of how they are born.  I'm not tolerant of idiots or bigots. I never, ever, ever claimed to be. 
t1_dslazyc	1	*	Bigot-hating bigots, I like that!  Couldnt agree more.  
t1_ds9js7o	0	*	And that's where you're wrong. You don't get to decide what motivation is best for other people. 
t1_dtvc04l	1	*	Because some ideologies believe selfishness is a great virtue.
t1_du39o7v	1	*	oh yoeah thats true.
t1_dsmccvn	1	*	Beautiful.
t1_dsn1ez4	1	*	If you have eaten fruit you have eaten fruit flies. 
t1_dsj5o2f	0	*	Not very reassuring, considering half of your comment is just insulting me.   A very defensive move. 
t1_dup3k7q	0	*	It was just a question, you're mighty defensive.
t1_dupy65i	1	*	I havent taken any stands...
t1_du0xuv2	0	*	Ah. You have no idea what you're talking about and you demonize Democrats. I take it back. You ARE a Republican. Congrats. 
t1_dupvrto	1	*	Yes, they're very clever that way, immorally exploiting lesser people. Completely wrong morally, but just further proves my point that they were smarter...
t1_dttv4q3	0	*	/u/dankjets911 has admitted to being a liar who has not the first clue what hes spouting. Let it be known.

t1_dulrpae	0	*	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narcoterrorism
t1_dua7w7n	0	*	Yes but it's not a loophole as you disingenuously claimed.
t1_dua7578	0	*	The ar-15 is not a fucking assault rifle.  Its a semi-automatic rifle that just looks military.  Thats like saying a Remington 1100 is a combat shotgun.  
t1_ds83lq8	0	*	Yes that is a long way of just saying sign language  Are you claiming that she isnt actually signing anything and her interpreter is just making it up?  Or does it not count cause its not ASL code?
t1_dsd0zuw	1	*	> I think most agree there is such a thing as black culture.  By that they mean Black American culture. There is absolutely no culture shared between all black (or white) skinned peoples.
t1_dscedy1	0	*	Should we lump in secular European nations like Sweden with North Korea and Vietnam?  Boy, that's so smart.  Overgeneralizing things can never go wrong.  Your post is totally relevant.
t1_dscaqt0	0	*	Colonialism was at gunpoint. White countries are voluntarily asking for immigrants to come in and pay for pensions and social services. Hardly comparable.

t1_dsc1bg6	0	*	No it's fucking not.
t1_dsc9v4t	0	*	Woah that explains why I still live in America 
t1_dsc4jja	1	*	Yes because the law is above all isn't it? Or are you allowed to have your personal vendettas?
t1_dsg4f8o	1	*	You don't have to be convinced for it to be true. I directly linked an article, that illustrates my point. Census data and the terminology that I used contradict your point. Have a nice life. 
t1_dukbuje	0	*	So the sentiment that Trump should take credit for this is based on bullshit spread by his paid shills.  Gotcha.
t1_dukhivo	0	*	I wasn't asking you any questions
t1_dukd406	0	*	You've got blinders on.   >He wasn't a politician in the 80s, and didn't have political aspirations until the late 90s.  Or   > after coming back from russia.  Which is it then? 
t1_dth9wrq	0	*	Thats okay, sometimes people just dont see things the same way. Thanks for the civil discussion, its a rarity on the internet these days!
t1_dtgt2fm	0	*	 I'm just trying to show you how to read a police statement. This is pretty basic, they are seeking to levy those charges against the perpetrators. 
t1_dtmt1q1	0	*	So if you don't like the options then write down the name of someone you like.  That's how universal suffrage works.
t1_duptcpk	0	*	Yep it's the called pretty much same thing in the US. We do Equivalent Single Axle Load (ESAL) calcs and the cars account for next to nothing compared to the trucks. 
t1_duplktf	1	*	Not really. 
t1_duqf5vt	1	*	What policy benefits everyone?
t1_dupsiby	1	*	Sorry the down votes made me defensive. I am right though and can explain in more detail if you like. 
t1_duqb44t	0	*	But you're increasing the number of people needed to guard the wall...
t1_duqbsy5	0	*	Did you read our thread? The whole point is that infant mortality would have no baring on adult life expectancy or more importantly in this case, Social Security.
t1_dupfps8	1	*	God Save the Queen

t1_dtni9hz	0	*	What are you talking about? You literally just jumped off a clif
t1_dt6uuck	0	*	No, I'm asking what is wrong in our society for us to actively purchase and promote all those negative things about hip-hop. You won't buy into something if you're not the least bit interested in it. 
t1_dssd8zg	1	*	You shouldn't be wilfully ignorant. What makes you think that the people in Singapore are unhappy?
t1_dt7g2hd	0	*	I'm actually okay with a logical reason to believe in God. So, what logic makes you believe in a God, especially the Abrahamic God of the Bible? 
t1_duhwrqo	1	*	Impossible. People will never let go of their political indoctrination.
t1_dugpl4j	1	*	Despite the fact that she had the superdelegates counted in her favour before she even announced her candidacy. 
t1_duj9nf5	0	*	I am a member of MENSA so I think you need to apologize.
t1_duh14a3	0	*	So you think it is all nonsense.  Do you think this has always been the case?  All the primary sources of the 20th century just a shot in the dark.
t1_duhuor3	0	*	Clinton had schemes, and just wanted the fucking job. Bernie wanted to work.
t1_duihk06	0	*	And whats happened in the past year?

t1_ducsmvs	0	*	You getting mad, im getting rich lmao.
t1_dudjnv8	1	*	Lol, you're taking percentage now? People with the ability to move out in 'nascent developing country' are either the richest or the best of the best. And 4.1 million of them did it.
