t1_dua9gtw	1	*	As one who doesn't know shit about uk politics, didn't Britain's citizens already decide this? 
t1_dupkyfz	1	*	Most of the time gun related crimes in public are reported on local news for a small segment, but it's not really breaking news. I mean it's like yeah I won't go there for a bit or oh shit someone got shot outside of McDonald's? But at least where I live, it's pretty much background noise.
t1_ducht10	1	*	well, we had those in the 90s and out country almost collapsed. Russia and democracy are incompatible

t1_duzai1d	1	*	The US is the world leader in Rail Freight, and many countries still come here to learn about our rail systems. You are right however in regards to our passenger rail. Its drastically behind other countries.

t1_duipxt0	0	*	Religion always was, always will be, the tool of the smart over the stupid masses. The day that religion gets chucked aside cannot come any faster. This shit has put Humanity on hold for hundreds of years now...it's ridiculous and sad, at the same time.

t1_duerkhn	1	*	Until they start turning over evidence and the accused priests themselves to the local and international authorities, this is all just various shades of PR.  As long as they shuffle rapists and abusers back into their midst in an accountability-free shell game, the whole organization is complicit.
t1_due082b	0	*	Yeah no thanks.  Tired of paying taxes and getting nothing in return. Not funding the leech class anymore.

t1_duulpzp	0	*	Reduced, not reduced to zero.
t1_duxusao	1	*	Yup. /r/canada is a shithole. I didn't always feel that way, as I was subscribed to it for years, but the last year or so was just too stupid, overrun with bigots, bots, trolls and shitty mods. 
t1_duowrgo	1	*	HAH HAH HAH HAH!!! DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY!  *gunshot*  Has just been revoked!
t1_duc58c0	1	*	Makes sense to me.  Without a doubt Trump had the greatest potential to weaken the US and was pushed by russian accts heavly.
t1_duyri2d	1	*	It's not that far, but the Trump Russia relationship could have started around that time.

t1_duad2si	0	*	Nope. Its called expertise and connections. Try it sometime. 
t1_dumwmz8	0	*	Not sure about Taiwan, but in any country with a fast food culture, straws are essential.   How does one consume a McDonalds shake without a straw?  In East Asia, disposable chopsticks are part of every meal.  Due to crowded cities, these places are germaphobic (notice the photos with Asians wearing surgical masks?) - it takes a long time to convince customers that utensils are sterile - especially with the scandals over tainted milk and cooking oil. 
t1_dugpg4f	1	*	He is a real stoner now!  
t1_duwy7gf	1	*	Objective was likely to chase the fishing vessel out of Argentine EEZ, not actually capture it.     /u/brembird        As for the [Argentine navy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_active_Argentine_Navy_ships)...    It is in a sorry state, no objections there.
t1_duq6ig2	1	*	Yes, it's not only the numbers that shock. I was stunned to have learned that Russian Paralympic athletes also doped. WTF Russia, you have to win *that* badly?   Also, bobsled why do you even need to dope in that sport?   .  PS I rejoice. I come from a country that borders those fuckers and I lost my hope that the world would ever see how deeply corrupt and lying and cynical they are.   But miracles do happen.

t1_dueeetw	1	*	1. Kevin Durant is a person.  2. Every person has opinions.  3. In a free democracy, every person has a voice.   4. If a person cannot voice his opinions, then he is not in a free democracy, and he is dehumanized.  5. Income does not denote personhood.  6. Therefore, income is irrelevant.

t1_duu7itw	0	*	Not exactly but... [Pastry War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastry_War)  Back in 1838, looting in Mexico caused damages to a French Bakery. The owner claimed compensation of 60,000 mexican pesos (the shop was valued in less than 1,000) and after a negative response from the Mexican government, the owner asked the support from France that led to the first war between the 2 countries.
t1_dub3oca	1	*	Are we talking about regular bread from the bakery baked by the baker the traditional way? Or are we talking American Wonder Bread?  Edit: Reading the article, the latter apparently. It basically boils down to additives and added sugar.

t1_duhlgqw	1	*	The Antarctic ice sheets are several miles thick. Most of that ice has been frozen for hundreds of thousands of years, some of it since 1.5 million years ago. You need a sustained warming over thousands of years to melt through the whole thing, and that hasnt happened in a while.
t1_ducrvpw	0	*	It takes two to tango going after the Russians first makes sense as the Russians are less likely to get a pardon so more likely to deal with the fbi.

t1_duqsn3y	1	*	I find it ironic that Americans suddenly don't care if the people working under their politicians are criminals conspiring with foreign agents against the United States.  When it was Clinton, all I saw coming out of American people's mouths was Huma Abedin and Podesta.   When it's the president's national security council, the chairman and vice chair-man of his recent campaign, and a national security adviser, then who really minds a little bit of conspiring against the country, you know?
t1_duswi3u	0	*	Good luck fending off an army.  No different than the US.  No single person with guns, regardless of caliber, rate of fire or size of arsenal can stop an army.  When the nation turns against you it's time to cash out and run.

t1_duj11s4	1	*	Understand though the shadow of communism. People really were forced into communal living. Imagine an apartment where you share a bathroom with several other people. Nothing works right. None of you can get enough good food. Nobody has any good entertainment. All negative memories. Now let homophobia add on top of that pile of negative memories.
t1_dua4tzz	0	*	You mean the same sort of thoughts and prayers Bullshit that happens everytime there's a bus of peace incident in Europe? Sympathy with no intention to fix the problem.  Europe with immigration is very fucking similar to America with guns. Not every immigrant/ gun owner wants to kill people. But there is that slight percentage that does.

t1_dupakog	1	*	> I'm going to expect crimes like these are going to keep increasing and keep escalating as long as their side aren't given a voice in the debate.  Which side would that be? The side that wants to stab people to death because they think that is the way to do politics (send a message to merkel)?  I am happy that you are arguing for that side. Keep it up. At least we know what everyone stands for.

t1_dusj8o0	0	*	Maybe someday we can live in a world where we mentally are in the 21st century and accept a basic income for everyone instead of enforce tribalistic guilt and force humans to work jobs making products and frippery we don't need.  Eventually all the basic needs for human kind will be automated and if humans don't have money to spend the machines won't be able to work.

t1_dusvvfj	0	*	That is a completely false assumption. There are Christians who live in the middle east, yet they don't blow people up like Muslims do. There is no jihad doctrine in Christianity or anything like it. There is no reward for killing infidels and yourself in Christianity. Islam is an objectively worse religion in terms of suffering for mankind.

t1_duaytv2	1	*	Or those guys that drew a penis on a drawbridge, because the asphalt kept wearing down and ruining people's tires. Every time the bridge goes up the penis would be fully erect in the face of those waiting in front of it. They keep covering it up with a new layer of asphalt, which wears down over time, revealing the penis again. I'm pretty sure even the original artist(s) didn't imagine such a success. 
t1_duh74xs	0	*	Wait Gates is only looking at 18 months, WTF? That's nothing for what they have done, and that's not nearly enough to scare someone into flipping. That will get plead down to absolutely nothing. You gotta be threatening at least 10 Years of a man's life to make him piss his pants and roll on someone. Especially when there will be millions waiting for him when he gets out. 18 months in white collar prison is a joke. Fuck this sucks. 
t1_dul14a4	1	*	There is speculation that Person A is German Kahn,  the father in law of van der Zwaan, and co-owner of Alfa group.  Kahn was mentioned in the Steele Dossier and Alfa was the company that had the odd server connection with a server in Trump tower. 
t1_dujpto1	1	*	Well, that doesn't say much. I know 3 year olds that source better than them. In fact, my 3 yo god son just came up to me and asked Gnomie, why doesn't politifact than source better than they do?  I more informational statement would probably be something like Politifact source wose than the sources DNC pay others to make up for them.

t1_dusr4lr	0	*	Given the size and growing influence of  China in the international economy/political scene, this is a very troubling development.  Take a step back and realize that many of the biggest and most influential countries are now trending towards open authoritarianism.

t1_duhehc0	1	*	Or he upset the wrong people
t1_dui5luv	1	*	Whatever it is its not xa35 a pint and xa31000 for living in a shithole.

t1_duqsfkf	1	*	comfort women
t1_duppehl	1	*	close, Krabbelgruppe
t1_dulfs6g	1	*	Yeah. Most Germans only know about Milbenkxe4se because it turn up on the internet occasionally.
t1_duxdgy6	1	*	I'm pretty sure this is just window dressing for the conservatives in the country.    There's a huge cultural divide within Iran and the Islamic government has always been much more willing to appease the conservative side more than the liberal.  I doubt very much they will actively enforce this new policy.  Women will be arrested very publicly and released very quietly. 
t1_duyvqh6	0	*	There was, Quantum of Solace. It was Bolivia in the movie, but same concept. 
t1_dugndpm	0	*	the federal government views them as official statements, they're being written in text in his name, twitter is simply the channel by which he releases those statements
t1_dui2aph	0	*	The big fuck up is that capital gains are taxed low and ordinary income can be twice as high.  It creates a hurdle that is difficult to get over.
t1_duw7nz6	1	*	Pray for syria. I don't know why they are killing their own people? God bless syria and Syrians. 
t1_dugc5qm	1	*	More than that all said and done, too bad they dont have huge amounts of money coming in from never ending source 
t1_duv1vbj	1	*	I agree that GMO's are probably not harmful, and that the benefits generally seem to far outweigh any potential risks...but your argument is not sound. Cigarettes are very bad for you, but you don't see heavy smokers dying at age 40 on average. The myriad health risks of cigarettes had to be discovered with statistical analysis and scientific rigor, you can't just glance at a population and make broad assumptions.
t1_duqxnwb	0	*	> I'm American and don't support our intervention there.  I understand having some reservations, but Coalition support of the Iraqi defense forces and Syrian local militias saved millions of Iraqis and Syrians from a terrible fate under ISIS. How can one be against that?
t1_durhjmv	0	*	yes, and american slaves and the survivors of the american genocide on the natives.
t1_dulgnox	1	*	Not in Ireland. They lean heavily on Catholic ethos there, even in secondary school. This includes bible studies with no mention of other religious books. One teacher I had spent half a term teaching only the pro life argument. Source: I'm Irish.
t1_duo814m	0	*	The Economist was one of the few Mainstream publications that supported Trump, albeit with a few reservations. It's funny that you're accusing one of the more nuanced Mainstream publications of being biased when they say something that you don't agree with!

t1_dudizue	0	*	Oh, but   >>However, Horizon said that Vimovo is a special formulation that's not the same as simply combining the two main ingredients.  I guess they wave a magic wand over it or something?  Edit: holy shit, people. I know I don't understand organic chemistry, I was just being silly. Quit it. 
t1_duutby5	0	*	So the four main powers in the world...  [Russia] Putin: 18 years - limited only in consecutive terms (unlimited)   [EU read:Germany] Merkel: 12 years - unlimited   [China] Xi: 4 years - unlimited   [USA] Trump: 1 year - limited to 8  If this is a race to totalitarianism, China/USA are a little behind, but China looks like it means to catch up. 
t1_dux1jiy	1	*	could you sell it to neighborinh countries?
t1_dugxo9t	1	*	It gets more hilarious each time. A big [Italian]( https://youtu.be/OZ94n9RTXhk) family beat up a bunch of Aussies.    If a family of bogans had been on the same ship they probably could have worked together to Shanghai the ship to Macau. 
t1_dupgq2d	1	*	Oh yeah, let the German military fall apart so when the next conflict happens, they have no means to defend themselves...
t1_duxtzy0	1	*	The worlds climate doesnt care about politics
t1_duzhj90	1	*	You can just straight up not use plastics. I just go to the bulk section of my local store and there I can get just about any non-processed food I want and take it home in a glass jar or a cloth bag. Of course this doesn't work if you want cheetos or oreos, but for the non processed foods its a fairly easy process.

t1_dun194q	0	*	Here's an idea... Straws are totally unnecessary and we're better off without them 
t1_dubaisx	1	*	I saw them getting their ass kicked at Sochi , i'm pretty sure Putin security services are the last of their concerns , and more that everyone hates in Russia 
t1_dup5yu0	1	*	Maybe because Putin isn't doing literally everything that happens in Russia? If you believe Putin is the only player in Russia, you've been reading clickbait a little too much.
t1_duswo3i	0	*	> Had the lesson not learnt?  It seems like China has scrubbed a lot of its history internally, so I'm not surprised if people haven't learned. 
t1_dul9w0b	0	*	There's a reason why students are exposed to every subject for a prolonged period of time. How will a child know what he wants to do in the future without being able to study many, many subjects - ones he wouldn't even think about, to allow him to see which ones he enjoys most?  Just to remind you on some of the subjects which you've degraded: Sciences and IT - two of the biggest industries in the world...
t1_dusluu2	1	*	because he wants to satisfy his ego and doesnt want to look like a loser
t1_ducvbak	1	*	Reddit has filters set in place and thousands of moderators who are volunteers in their community. Twitter can easily spread misinformation the moment it happens much like Reddit did with the Boston bombing.    When I heard Russian groups used Facebook events to have two sides clash in protest, that's when I knew how easily manipulated people are with the internet.
t1_duerdaw	1	*	> But isn't it rich in fertiliser?  It *is* fertilizer.  >And doesn't it turn into ethanol  No.  >AND produce biogas  It can.  >Suprised the Dutch aren't making the most of a shitty situation.  They are. 
t1_ducc7v6	1	*	KGB, not FSB. There was no FSB back in the days of gulags.  Also, you've misinterpreted the last letter. What he said was: Alright, I did what I could with digging up the patch. You'll have to plant the seeds yourself, though.

t1_duphi16	1	*	It is okay.
t1_dumgi9i	1	*	This is commonly the right and NRA stance.  Teachers cant stop fucking students, and we think they will be rational?  We want them to aim and hit a target, yet they cant paralell park thier car.  Students stole all the triple beam scales and computers,  camt wait to see how many teacher guns go missing.
t1_duyjzs9	1	*	lol no here has printer their mission accomplished banner quite yet. But when the president is literally the worst person you have laid eyes on, its nice to have a distraction. 
t1_dun8dt4	1	*	The classroom will be a microcosm reflecting the US as a whole, sounds good!
t1_duwqj3c	1	*	That's how everything is in the US. If you bust your ass to move up in the world and make more money, they tax that money at an even higher percentage. And I have friends in their 30's and 40's who want a kid or want a second kid, but can't make the numbers work still, yet they have to pay for the kids of people who just fuck all day and pop them out and don't think of the costs from their own budget or the taxpayers budgets.
t1_dux2se5	1	*	Dictators everywhere you look! USA is next 
t1_duqi9p4	1	*	No we're not

t1_duj6tvz	1	*	making iPhones in a chinese factory for 10 years.
t1_duwwu7t	1	*	>I really don't understand why we aren't trying to get rid of all negative language and why this anti white stuff is allowed to fly.  Because the anti-language stuff is selectively applied based on the ideology of who's pushing it. Like how it was used by the right in the early 2000's, and the left now.  The anti-white stuff is a part of left ideology, so it gets you a position in the Labour party.
t1_dulbmz8	0	*	Interesting, where did you pull this from ?
t1_dul8mob	1	*	Funeral strippers? Nah. Maybe they meant funnel strippers. That makes even less sense. Funeral Poppers like the ones people have at other parties maybe? But you dont hire those. You just buy those. That still doesnt fit. Funeral. Strippers. Yup, thats what it says.

t1_duaiboh	1	*	He's barred from running.  (It's mentioned in the article.)
t1_dutuil0	1	*	Nemtsov was never a real pain either, his status as a 90s politician has made him permanently unelectable in Russia. He was killed by Chechen muslims for making anti Muslim statements.

t1_dub9rys	1	*	Look the board of directors of Rosneft and Gasprom. This companies are no more Russian than any other tnc. In modern world governments serve as tools for corporations, not the other way around. Basically Russian military is a 'protection' for these companies, nothing more. Just like US millitary is a 'protection' for competitors.

t1_dul5seu	0	*	But what does polio have to do with measles? In the US you have around a .000208125% of catching and dying from measles. And if you do happen to catch it, it is pretty mild. Kids used to be excited they got to stay home from school when they caught it. Thats like showing someone a picture of a heroin addict in the street with his arm rotting off as a means of getting people to not smoke pot.

t1_dutj3rm	0	*	Look up Operation Downfall. The alternatve was considerably worse.
t1_duc6nib	1	*	haha, there is evidence showing  cutting down all oak trees in Houston would have a bigger (favorable) impact on ground level ozone than getting rid of all the cars, because of their VOC production.  I guess it's all about what problem you are actually trying to solve.  
t1_duca303	1	*	Hi friendly wkwk!  It's simple, we choose what we buy. If we don't like what you're offering, we'll stop buying it. That simple.  You want to keep selling us shit? Won't work, sell it to someone else.  Bye.

t1_duxsape	1	*	He's not saying extinction will occur in 2023 but that 2023 is when climate change can become beyond control and lead to the extinction of humans. It would take much longer than that to kill all humans. But the damage we can add in the next 5 years could very well lead to a climate humans won't be able to adapt in.

t1_dukzk73	1	*	Critical thinking in this context involves using reason to highlight the flaws in the arguments espoused by extremists.  If you are ignoring or attempting to dismiss extreme ideologies then you are going out your way to avoid critical thought.

t1_dur78y7	1	*	Election campaigning in Denmark is a lot different and won't start until at least a year from now. Nobody in Denmark considers this point in time close to an election at all. You can't even put up your candidate posters until a month before. On top of this, the school shootings are not really a partisan issue at all. Domestically, Lars Lxf8kke will neither gain or lose points from this because we know his opponents agree.  I agree with your sentiment but I think it's just a bit off in this case.
t1_duoexon	1	*	My guess is that it means he won't get away free, but those charges will turn to probation, fines, and time served plus a few years in minimum security in a few years if all goes well.  He's in too deep to be allowed to get away for free.
t1_dupom9i	1	*	Isn't the German military constitutionally and via international treaty, limited by certain parameters and qualifications that limits their size, capacity, and possession of certain weapons? Not saying that's sole factor and that they still put a preference on Education, science, infrastructure, etc. compared to countries like the US, but the fact they may be constrained by codified limits starts to undercuts your fuck military and protectionism argument on it's face, no? 
t1_dud82m9	1	*	No, this is what US citizen might want. It is absolutely not what the political US wants, or rather wanted before Trump. Obama only demanded that the EU states increased their spending to at least meet the Nato target, he didnt support an EU army (neither did he fight it, afaik), and Bush actually fought the idea.

t1_duy20gb	1	*	So he commits suicide when there's dissent?  I thought that was Lenin.  That's why he's a lich living in a mausoleum near a cemetery.  Fun tidbit: fantasy creature Lich is actually loosely based on Vladimir Il'yich Lenin (which is almost pronounced as lich).  That's why they're all undead wizards that live in crypts or mausoleums.

You will find him talking about taking the means of production, nationalizing it, and giving ownership to those who work the production with their own hands.

I realize that Chinese social media is limited by the government, so the people's ability to rally there is limited as well, but I'm just wondering how accepting the average person in China would be of this move.

t1_dussxfs	0	*	That's no exaggeration. Even in a dictatorship, term limits are the biggest single protection against tyranny. As long as you have them, people's loyalty is to the state. One you remove them, it's to the leader.
t1_dunpyo7	0	*	Stealing a massive ammount of money from the people and creating an environment where people dont know whats true anymore, filling key positions with people that work against public interest, empowering the far right...  Edit: Disclaimer: I am not saying Trump started it, Obama wasnt better, Trump is just such an incompetent buffoon that makes it really obvious. But none of that makes it ok.

No one is converting people in those classes, but I wouldn't have learned about a lot of different religions if not for school. Religion is still a big part of the world and choosing to ignore it is in my opinion a bad move because you're taking something from these students. Something that once was exposed to them is gone.

Would you like me to smoke up before I do my surgical side of my job? Fuck no.   Cannabis has a big side effect called getting high.   My response is this. Stop prescribing opiates for stupid shit. You don't need pain medication for everything.
t1_dueuxss	1	*	I dunno, man. I am wholeheartedly against political meddling, but I think shutting down subreddits is a slippery slope and can be pretty anti free-speech. I mean it TOTALLY is up to the site's discretion, but I feel like Reddit should be a bastion for discussion, and a place where communities can be self moderated rather than by the site's admins.

t1_duunn9a	1	*	Reasonable Troll Factory Awareness? 
t1_duyy2w0	0	*	Because it is two completely different business models and processes.  There are so many tales about companies failing to adapt.

t1_dutdp1w	1	*	I believe their #1 metric for successful leadership is stability. This far, it has meant stable growth and not stagnation. As long as stuff goes fine, it'll be business as usual. If there will be a recession, then things will get interesting. Or the very least when the Great Democrat, Death, catches up with Mr. Xi and they will need to find a successor.

t1_duesqc6	1	*	Facebook and Google. I agree that it may make easier to block them at the border rather than getting them to respect copyright.  I doubt they will be able to enforce anything. It may be simpler to just take their code and let anyone re-develop it in country without copyright payment restrictions. Heck they can give it away to other countries. Reciprocity is a two way street.

t1_dudldhn	1	*	Why hasnt anyone pointed out that yes, although Russia meddled in our election - mostly by trolling on the internet - meddling in elections is what the United States does best. Its the Ace in our deck. We literally go around the globe toppling governments and killing thousands of innocent civilians so that we can physically replace their government to our likening. Maybe we should look in the mirror from time to time. 
t1_duw6pky	0	*	Sure, but just remember a few things.  A few million is not an incredible amount, and they get this money through selling there crude oil. Not nocking Norway, but not every country has that much disposable income from publicly owned natural resources.

t1_dudu5js	0	*	We really don't need to be so angry at this company. I bet you that no insurance company would pay for this. And no hospital stocks this.

Article doesn't really say.  But I feel you, any environmental news story anymore is so damn depressing.
t1_duzeihm	1	*	Given that granting asylum is part of the executive branch powers, no way that will happen anyway.  They'd be better off asking Canada or Mexico for asylum.

t1_duos7ma	0	*	Tbf, he actually said he was going to these horrible things straight up to the people.  He was still elected, hell he was elected because he said those things. 
t1_duqov73	1	*	I would say the **any possibility of future** release depending on the outcome of therapy part is a good hint that hell spend a long time in the institution. Even the judge stated he doubted therapy would be successful, which means that this ex-priest will stay in the psychiatric institution, potentially until he dies.
t1_dud5a1j	1	*	There is no such thing as international law if it does not apply to every country equally. 
t1_dufn6nt	0	*	I think the deep state just really dropped the ball this time. Usually it's one deep state operative against another, but this time Trump came out of nowhere.

t1_dupx0er	0	*	Im stocking up on my popcorn to watch the theater 
t1_duiazr3	1	*	Tax [rates](http://federal-tax-rates.insidegov.com/l/45/1960) were incredibly high during that era so a lot of stuff was done to not pay them.    >1960 Top Federal Tax Rates top rate on regular income: 91% top rate on capital gains: 25% top rate on corporate tax: 52% 
t1_dutghb6	1	*	In many countries religious institutions have to pay property tax on the *commercial* properties they own. 
t1_duv1kd2	1	*	There was that time Argentina invaded and inconsequential bit of land on a premise of mostly machismo. The British retook their tiny strip of land.   So, if Argentina started another war over a principle - for a second time - it wouldn't be too incredibly surprising.
t1_duib8j1	1	*	Someone inform this guy that one person paying more taxes, even a billionaire, won't make a difference. It takes everyone paying their fair share.
t1_duusu52	0	*	all you have to do is say fake news and anything the reporters might write becomes irrelevant

t1_dubvu9r	0	*	Can someone explain to me why clean coal is bad? It sounds great in theory.
t1_dupl4bf	0	*	See many countries look at what Germany are don't and just cut public spending and projects hoping it will help. Germany know that investing in new technologies and not putting your country into austerity helps your country grow.  Cutting tax for the big firms all the time won't help your country grow, actually investing in young people and projects is what helps GDP increase, not cutting spending and refusing to help new technologies evolve.
t1_duxlr2y	0	*	Being allowed to wear whatever you want without being hated for it is empowering.  America has the opposite problem where wearing a hijab will get you much more bullshit than not wearing one.  I hate Islam too, but there's no reason to pretend that you don't understand that.
t1_duvu53w	1	*	I read the article and didn't see any strong points. Just more European bureaucrats doing their thing,
t1_dul4d7l	1	*	Everyone being so certain of this persons likely fate, yet he wasn't.   Ask yourself this, why is he named in all these interviews and why aren't his photographs pixelated to disguise his identity?   I mean at the end of the day, whatever he is - he's not exactly a patriot is he?
t1_dug2zvu	0	*	Give them your address and offer your place 
t1_dudxiym	0	*	No it's was Germany and they lost that game
t1_dufud15	1	*	> I dont think religious freedom should be part of this debate. Your rights to religious freedom end where another persons penis begins.  FTFY
t1_duccsgd	1	*	Agreed. But then that raises the question of why that misinformation is being spread so deeply that Time magazine sees it as a legitimate statistic.
t1_dul4kt6	0	*	Puerto Rico is a US territory.  Basically they dont have representation in congress but the us government has jurisdiction over them. They sounds like a bad deal but they get protection and aid from the federal government in times of need.
t1_dugtxxz	1	*	Absolutely. I expect nothing less from reddit and Wapo
t1_due0wmx	1	*	You know they are going to fast-track his canonization, just like they did with Pope John Paul II.

t1_duteqv6	0	*	You're aware that they're doing this so the girls can be found, right? Are you suggesting they go out looking for charred remains instead?
t1_duniskq	0	*	Yeah because CNN and Fox (someone who criticizes Al-Jazeera certainly follows one of these two) are just bastions of free speech.

t1_duh6dia	0	*	Who needs Florida anyway? As long as they save Mar a Lago.

t1_dudrfqg	0	*	>(The United States has] got this jerk, Rodchenkov, Putin said on Jan. 30. Everything is based on the statements by this man who can hardly be trusted in anyway.  plenty of air, just no apology. reminds of trump.
t1_duiiqsi	0	*	You're as likely to see this activity in evangelical Christian churches as you are in 'pagan' outfits. The UKCG is one of the orgs involved in exorcisms and they're run by a Brazilian conman.
t1_duv99q7	1	*	What a pussy.  It's not like the Thai people were cool with his comics.  
t1_dumlzdl	1	*	They should also arm the kids with glocks.
t1_dukvbya	1	*	Maduro a year from now: We're nationalizing the cryptocurrency!
t1_dudg5vw	1	*	no
t1_duigsdz	0	*	Absolutely preach.   My hometown is ravaged with buy to let properties. Entire blocks owned by a group of 3 people renting out somewhere I could pay a xa3300 a month mortgage for xa3700 a month.   My girlfriends landlord recently phoned her directly and threatened to increase her rent because she reported a broken radiator. A guy whos admitted hes never set foot in our town, yet rents 4 properties in it.   
t1_duwi465	1	*	Right. The rest of the world just Shakes its head. 
t1_duy8bbe	0	*	How difficult is it to handle winter cold in Norway?  
t1_duw0mi4	0	*	Watch out what you ask for.  If a polar shift occurs, Australia will likely be on the new equator.
t1_duj4aij	1	*	Why do you think he markets himself like that? He knows the people. Putim cares about politics, not gay people.
t1_duiq4cn	1	*	Then it'll be us turning our back on America. We've already kicked them out of Seoul, its time we kicked them out of the country. I'm very happy to get our nuclear program back on track much like Israel.  
t1_dursgsw	0	*	>> I will follow you home . . . I will follow you and beat you at home.  I wonder what the legal ramifications would be for beating a foreign leader to death in self defense. That would be one for the law books, that's for sure.
t1_dutxpif	0	*	It doesn't take any effort to be better than PSUV. You can go to the bathroom after going to a burrito festival and the result would be better than PSUV.
t1_dujil1q	0	*	[From the big man himself](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/965676314576543744)
t1_dupsmjw	1	*	There's an old Daniel Tosh bit like this. (Paraphrasing) I think athletes should be forced to take steroids. I have HDTV, whatever makes you run faster, jump higher. I want my sports like my video games. Your life is over after 40 anyway...
t1_duruq5b	1	*	Is it indoctrination or a problem you wouldn't have answered any better than Truman?

t1_duuj5n7	1	*	England and island had 2 wars Iirc about fishing rights. Both were non leathal iirc
t1_durdvg1	0	*	The only reason many still hold grudges against Japan is that in their current educational system, they don't acknowledge many of the atrocities they committed in World War II. Can you imagine the kind of righteous anger many Asians feel whenever Japanese deny their crimes?
t1_duflobn	1	*	It's pretty close. There are a lot of safety provisions in place.
t1_dumvbyq	0	*	A certain portion of boomers still cling to their racist and bigoted upbringing, and the propaganda feeds right into that.
t1_dust4ju	0	*	It seems dictatorship is in, democracy is out across the world. The 21st century is going to end much different than it began
t1_dugh226	0	*	Exactly. I'm also seeing a whole lot of comments throughout reddit telling us to not be angry at conservatives--that even most of them don't like Trump.  This is the same shit they did with Nixon (and to a lesser extent Bush). Defend their conservative elected official  to the bitter end, then claim they never liked him.   Conservatives keeps giving us shit candidate after shit candidate while we sit back and pretend like both sides are the same.  People need to be pissed.  
t1_dutyymm	1	*	Ironic
t1_duq10sw	1	*	It is amazing how the Russian Olympic athletes perfectly represent their nation

t1_durke3m	1	*	The gun fanatics really came out of the woodwork here...
t1_dupfap6	0	*	>Fuck military and protectionism   You do realise one of the reasons Germany doesn't have to spend a shitload on Armed Forces is because it's under the American military protection right?   Edit: OP you edited the fuck out of your post, the reason Germany doesn't have a military is because it's been occupied since 1945. Again as with my first post, I am not posturing a political position just merely stating an observable fact. 
t1_duxi5cz	1	*	> The bill allows for several exemptions, in particular for shooting sports.  > Frolich attributed the long delay in drafting the proposal to the fact that many hunters in Norway use semi-automatic firearms.  Basically, this is old news. If you look at a Norwegian newspaper today, you'll barely find it mentioned.  Edit: grammar.
t1_dunii3m	1	*	Or drinking right out of the cup like an adult. 
t1_dunii3j	1	*	http://www.engrish.com/2013/09/im-bubble-tea/
t1_duhn5hc	1	*	Agreed but there's so much American propaganda pushed out the Pentagon and state department it's ok to have opposing views. 
t1_dugzk3z	1	*	It took 2 years to bring Nixon down, didn't it? I'm not old enough to know if his defenders were saying the same things a year into *that* investigation, but I wouldn't be surprised if they did.
t1_duvo0sx	1	*	It's sad that your comment has negative votes. Some people are so pro-science that they forget to be pro-human too.

t1_duoajx3	1	*	We can't afford it after our massive tax break..

t1_duff2r1	1	*	Yeah these were my concerns during the vote ineven voiced my concerns on here under a different name and even voiced them IRL but everyone just shouted project fear at me, and here we are all my fears coming true. I don't want the UK to turn into another US (no offence Americans).
t1_duj5i0a	1	*	No. No one takes this video seriously here. There are homophobes, yes, more than in the west, but it's uncommon in the younger groups. Please stop painting everything about Russians with a broad brush.
t1_duy5ejo	1	*	Why dont they invest some money in a phenotype printer? Im sure they could afford it. Especially if it helps to clear up their weak technology when it comes to passports. I mean, most of the newer passports will have a lot of security features.  Hehe..........
t1_dur28ln	0	*	Did you bother reading beyond the first sentence?  >Indias army chief General Bipin Rawat said on Wednesday a planned influx of people from Bangladesh into the countrys northeast is taking place as part of a proxy warfare by Pakistan with support from China.
t1_duwxlf3	1	*	Who the hell makes these agreements for a time frame of ten years?  That's just asking for trouble. Somebody fucked up hard even if the projection came true.

t1_duy935t	1	*	If a person has not yet committed a crime, aren't they innocent by definition?
t1_dueqx12	0	*	Canadians aren't very politically apt, I say this as someone who lives here currently. The CBC is nothing short of government propaganda at this point, but no one does anything about it because its the mouthpiece of Canada's  progressive  race baiting government. 
t1_dukepf6	1	*	Of course it was, he's sort of like a Russian Snowden but on a much smaller scale. Talking about state secrets usually doesn't end very well no matter what country you're from.
t1_duqfoge	1	*	As they should
t1_dujsgt5	1	*	Impeachment is a political process. It would require a majority in the house to start the proceedings, and two thirds in the Senate. Unfortunately, in this hyper partisan time its very hard to imagine Republicans in Congress to vote against the president. I mean many of the Republicans decided to support freaking Roy Moore so they wouldn't lose a seat in the senate. 
t1_dumumgd	0	*	I thought it was cruel nickname for [The Governor of New York](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Cuomo)
t1_duc0yas	1	*	Russia is in Syria because they were invited by Syria as a long-term ally to the country.  Syria request assistance from her allies to defeat ISIS and other terrorist groups in the country.  That is why Russia and Iran are supporting Syria.  Russia is also a major player in the oil & gas sector and it goes without saying that they can assist Syria in that industry sector.  
t1_dusmuso	1	*	If youre bombing the airfields and the people who are carrying out the bombing of the civilians, then yeah, it kinda is. It certainly isnt to drop notes or soup.

t1_duxlqfr	1	*	Let me help you out of this rabbit hole by not providing you safe drugs doses in order to quit, or stat alive, but rather make you use peasant drugs from greasy dangerious dealers while we the government get no money to help taxpayers paying for your drugs and we also get shot trying to fight these drug dealers instead of putting them out of buisness 
t1_duhw1ca	1	*	Beta blockers. Golf had to start testing for it a few years back after many players were found to be using it because they felt it improved their putting.  WADA bans them so you can't use them in Olympic Curling either.
t1_duwvefh	1	*	Also noteworthy. Both the prime minister of Quebec and the minister of health are specialised doctors...
t1_duhw1c9	1	*	Yes, it could be like the Permian Extinction, when volcanoes erupted from underneath vast coal fields and released billions of tons of CO2 into the atmosphere, increasing global temperatures by over 10C and killing off over 90% of all land and sea animals.

t1_duoqpeq	0	*	Is this like, a thing? Is Argentina known internationally for drugs or something? I'm from there and this is the first time I hear something like that.  I mean, there's drugs here, obviously, but from what I understand it mostly comes from neighbouring countries.
t1_dud6ub8	1	*	But what a great time to be alive! 
t1_ductq3j	1	*	Yes, it's the 93% upvoted conspiracy. Damn russians are at it again.
t1_duqyqy5	0	*	No shit, Occupy Wall Street had way less money than that and had an endless supply of pizza, coffee and cigarettes for a couple months.  I'd like to know more about how this money is used.
t1_dulm1dd	1	*	No. No one with any sense wants a Brexit. Even those trying to implement it *generally* understand it's going to screw us, but they see it as something that the country democratically voted for (ignoring the fact that less than 50% of those eligible to vote actually voted to leave) and therefore something that has to be implemented. I'm sure there are plenty of politicians still looking for some way out.
t1_dugsfkr	1	*	So, what do you want? Fox? Breitbart? Some other place entirely? 
t1_duz203t	1	*	Well guess who actually is the leader lol. Ideals and reality  tough shit

t1_dusz9yr	1	*	isnt it?
t1_duy6k4x	1	*	Jacob Zuma is no longer the President. He was ousted by his Deputy Cyril Ramaphosa. The ANC are playing a dangerous game capitulating to the extreme left socialist (actually Fascist) leanings of the EFF trying to gain back votes. However this actually strengthens the EFF's hand as an opposition party with less than 10% is now dictating the order of the day.

t1_dun9sxv	1	*	Interesting Radiolab did a good story on this recently, but their witness said there was a cafeteria in the building
t1_duo3uql	0	*	> Seen on Twitter:  A week ago Congress was asking Tide to change their pod designs so that teenagers would stop eating them.  Now this week the media thinks teenagers should determine gun control laws.  I know the punchline is supposed to be that teenagers are stupid, but isnt there some irony to the fact that Congress will try to influence industry to protect kids against the dangers of Tide pods but not against the dangers of guns?
t1_duk3qqk	1	*	He has said many times that the whole Russia story is a hoax and that he trusts Putin when he says Russia didn't meddle.

t1_dugdxaw	0	*	Hah not anytime soon. bell is a huge Canadian corporation that is involved with massive back-pocket deals. No politician would say no to Bell (or Rogers too for that matter).
t1_duqovhl	1	*	His big concern is that it comes out that Russian interference actually did make a difference and the realization that the Russians thought it was way better for them if he won the election.  He's so uptight about that, he committed obstruction (ironically his only crime here I bet) to cover it up.

t1_duktkuo	0	*	Thanks for saying what I was too lazy to type. Even as an atheist I still see the benefits of religious studies from a geopolitical viewpoint 
t1_dunz6lu	1	*	Because stuff like democracy and freedom and constitution are just that, words.

It's always been this way, we just managed to delude ourselves into thinking that cooperation and mutual aid were what actually got us this far.

Crimea use to be the #1 destination, but most Russians lost interest once it was annexed and the Russian ruble replaced the Ukrainian hryvnia. It use to be a fairly inexpensive place to vacation in when under Ukrainian rule.

t1_duk8cak	0	*	I think 'rebels' is increasingly being used a catch all description by the media to describe irregular belligerents of unknown loyalty. It's become more and more obvious (as usually happens in these environments) that even identifiable rebel groups begin to factionalise. I think 'rebel' increasingly means not ISIS and not the SAA, but could be any group on the spectrum in between

Gates was also so much of a dum-dum that he decided to lie during an interview session during which he was immune and nothing he said would be used against him, causing his lawyers to go from I prefer not to work this way to nope, we're not doing this anymore, seeya!
t1_dupj0bo	0	*	If you've paid attention to what ANC party leaders have been saying about white people following the Penny Sparrow incident, you could see this coming. If I was white in South Africa I would have left already. 
t1_dui13wb	0	*	Im on the older end of millenial and have a decent job for a big corporate. The only way most homeowners my age that I know have managed to buy a house is by an older relative dying and getting a chunk of inheritance for a deposit. I dread to think what state well be in by the time my 5 year old is an adult.
t1_duhxgzt	1	*	Sometimes I hope that I'm wrong about whether or not hell exists, because some people really do deserve to spend an eternity or two sitting in a pit of fire.

t1_dui6fk3	1	*	Yeah, but there are laws. No need to play drama queen and make a public display out of it. Its not like you could steal stuff from a museum without consequences, only because they are Chinese exhibits.

Oddly, I read the entire article and had been giving them credit for covering this nuanced issue far more thoroughly and even-handedly than U.S. news outlets typically do.    Regardless of where you come down on the law that Trump repealed, photographs of our President signing a bill into law are, or should be, public record, as public as the text of the law he is signing into place.  Their refusal to release the photo is unacceptable.

t1_duq8z14	0	*	That would just prove that democrats were circumventing the meager laws in place to give more money to Hillary's campaign (which is why the DNC was almost broke for quite some time). Doubt Dems would allow that to happen.

t1_duyu1jq	1	*	Not relevant. The 2013 meetings in Moscow with Putin are. 
t1_duk4eoo	0	*	Ok, so he should definitely enact those sanctions that he signed that are just sitting on his desk, right?  He should definitely start directing our intelligence agencies to do everything in their power to ensure that we are prepared the next time Russia tries to interfere, right?
t1_duszggj	1	*	> and we'll be lucky to avoid Trump.  I'm sorry what? Is there something Trump has done or said to indicate he wants to scrap term limits?? I must have missed this.

t1_duymvdo	1	*	Thats not what was claimed, it was said he paid them to pee on the bed because he knew the suite was used by Obama, did not sleep in it.  Whether any of it is true, who knows. Its become a pretty bizzare game of telephone though.

t1_duzdxbk	0	*	The Arctic is the fastest warming place on Earth. This reduces the temperature difference between the Arctic and the northern temperate latitudes, which is what makes the polar jet stream go, and the polar jet stream is what keeps Arctic air in the Arctic.  Now the polar jet winds and loops like a lazy river, and it no longer serves as the windwall containing Arctic cold. Cold air is denser and heavier, so it slips south towards the equator, drawn by centrifugal force. 
t1_duktnhl	1	*	Trumps America is the result of things you dont say, the American electorate is going to have to be one comfortable with uncomfortable decisions or accept the western world is going to end.

t1_duwq0pk	0	*	But decriminalization does nothing to address the issue of violence related to narcotics sales. While it not might not be as bad in Finland, in the US its the biggest reason for our insanely high murder rates. Drug dealing is fueling street crime, and even in countries like Finland if its not fueling street crime it is definitely fueling international crime groups, I mean the Taliban does get a good portion of its funding through its opium production.

How are you going to pay for this loan now that overnight your business was ruled illegal? What about the 200 people that work for you? What about all your competitors? What about the businesses that rely on you to do their business? And what about the businesses that rely on *those* businesses?
t1_dulxqch	0	*	Oil really isn't that important anymore. Especially for the US since the whole shale gas boom. Your comment sounds like it's the 1990s. Not that the US doesn't have their agenda but geopolitics isn't just it's all about the oil, certainly not anymore.
t1_dui7kqj	0	*	You sir or ma'am are spot on. I stand with you in your belief. 
t1_dujkthh	1	*	He also hasn't exclusively said he isn't an orange yet. I'm waiting for him to falsely claim that he isn't.
t1_dujwslc	1	*	Trump never had a board of directors to answer to. His company's owned by his family outright, so he never even had a board he had to be accountable to.
t1_duq8ul9	1	*	I don't think you understand the article. The money wasn't used to mail only NRA members. It was to fund broad advertisements supporting Trump.  > The NRA spent a record $55m during the 2016 election cycle, directing money towards campaigns and adverts supporting members of congress it judged to be most supportive of its aims and polities. 
t1_duht1pj	1	*	Loved my Ralph Bucks!
t1_dud4vl4	1	*	There is no allegation in this indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity. There is no allegation in the indictment that the charge conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election.  LIBS: REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE  
t1_dusmn9q	1	*	Possibly not pathetic, but also not commendable considering that Pexf1a Nieto is a corrupt moron constantly humiliating himself, president of a country whose national identity is defined in large part by (posturing against) U.S. interference.

Gates is a big supporter for vaccination, so offered to cover the debt for the vaccinations. Good stuff considering many the vaccination coverage in many countries is going backwards.

t1_dudncdo	1	*	I take it you mean George Soros, seeing as republican idiots always use him as a boogeyman. How did he interfere with the election? 
t1_duw3v19	0	*	They're really down voting you? Haha.
t1_dud9m5k	1	*	This may fall on deaf ears but how exactly? It explicitly states there is no allegation that any American was a knowing participant in the illigal activity committed.

t1_dur9j4b	1	*	On the other hand, up until he got caught, he was living pretty well. I suspect that many people do the math - odds of getting caught, quality of life until you're caught - and decide fuck it, it's worth rolling the dice.   A lot of people live large for decades before getting nailed to the wall. Maybe it's worth it? (To be clear, I'm perfectly happy not going that route.)

t1_durfoc2	1	*	>Someone gotta explain them idiots.  Ironic.
t1_duvi19u	1	*	They think this way because, until very recently, things did magically disappear; its called biodegradablity. Then the west introduced plastics and neocapitalist corporations and everything is wrapped in plastic.

t1_ducrcp9	1	*	Why would I make any effort to stop people who are at the moment supporting my political interests? The DNC is undoubtedly going to try to stop this as they simply dont have the resources to fight against the RNC on top of foreign intelligence agencies.  Thats their motive, theres no reason to help them out. Of course we must stop short of obstruction, but from a realpolitik perspective, the enemy of my enemy is my friend.
t1_duwko2j	0	*	Wrong. Its a common misconception. They dont get 100$ for being on time, they lose 100$ for being late. When we say that cardiologists get a 430 000$ salary per year, it assumes that they get every bonus like this. But the public doesnt get it. 
t1_dur12ob	0	*	Possibly,  the terrorists there could turn their attention on China for attacks. However, China could better fund terrorists there to strike the U.S. in Afghanistan or at India. China could use them as a tool for further gain or they could be a Chinese problem, just depends.

t1_dujj08p	1	*	The Republican party has to realize that they have more to lose by sticking with him, then by jettisoning him.  I've often thought that Trump was the ultimate all-in candidate. The Republicans were going to get blamed for him regardless of what he does, so they might as well stick with him until it's political suicide.   Keep in mind, there are still a lot of Trump fans in this country.   For lack of a better phrase:  It's the economy, stupid. (a famous quote)

t1_dulzoal	0	*	It was Ray Liota
t1_duuapbg	0	*	I wish I understood metric. Fahrenheit and feet/miles is too ingrained in my head and I cant visualize anything else
t1_duwe550	0	*	German here.   Sounds like it should be 0 on the military (stop calling it defense) and 65 on refugees.  Also: There is no such thing as economic refugees. You seem to be conflating refugees and immigrants. Says a lot about you, really.
t1_dulfe52	1	*	Well you'll be surprised to hear that marriage is optional in Canada and we don't really have any official paper for married couple. At the federal level there is no marriage certificate or anything. 
t1_due76iv	0	*	> So if these 13 Russians ever traveled to any of these countries, the local authorities would likely arrest them and send them to the United States for prosecution.   Until Trump pardons them.
t1_durbom5	1	*	we will probably find the us is interfering to cause this problem in the first place, they love to fuck with other countries... let me guess V has a nationalized oil company? this is probably how a us company takes over their oil.
t1_duolv05	1	*	More like they got repeatedly invaded. 
t1_duvhlys	1	*	Hey, I've heard worse. This is at least progressive lol
t1_dueparp	0	*	Whom is this world coming upon?
t1_durkw1t	0	*	I get the same response arguing with my brother about this. It is so frustrating when people deny facts because their internet news rag told them it was all lies.  Its amazing how easily manipulated some people can be.
t1_duqxhrm	0	*	Greatest super power in history, who China?
t1_dusye92	1	*	More refugees from tunesia, gambia and whoever can afford the people trafficers.  Fun fact: Germany does not check the identity or criminal records of the people entering. This offer is very attractive for criminals from all over the world. Mr Amri, the christmas market killer, had fourteen different identities. All of them a present of the german government.
t1_dusj5hx	1	*	The funny part is, if you were Mexican, you'd know how memeable and ridiculous our president is; Trump is not being ridiculed by any state leader, he's being ridiculed by the most ridiculous joker of a president in the continent. 
t1_duap2bm	1	*	The Israeli Police help their communities. Crazy ha-woo puts their security at risk with his aggression.  So it's not really that hard to understand why the people would trust those who trust walking the street with them, to one man who rarely walks alone.
t1_duyawt3	1	*	Wait a minute, are you telling me a government and currency that nobody believes in is absolutely worthless to everyone? Well I never!
t1_dus0l3d	0	*	This is where United States leadership is required as has been the case in recent history of world conflict. Too bad they are stuck dealing with internal domestic issues. I still think if someone has to pick between U.S and Russia as supper power I would always pick U.S. 
t1_duuai33	0	*	Last year, maybe the year before, there was an ask Reddit thread asking something about what do you think its to late for. My response was that were over the tipping point to do any meaningful reversal of our impact on climate. I was downvoted to the bottom of the thread if I recall correctly.   After several years studying environmental science and climate change, I still firmly believe it. 
t1_duow5j1	1	*	Might be good for Mexican farmers to escape the USA's heavily subsidised agriculture and dumping. 
t1_dula4yo	0	*	Perfectly summed up. As an outsider looking in, America has got the to be the most ridiculous nation on fucking earth
t1_dur5i4k	1	*	costs too much, the oil would bring in too little so not a good bounty and there are no terrorists...
t1_ducp8pp	0	*	It should also make it much harder for the GOP to keep trying to discredit Mueller and the investigation.
t1_duhiqa5	1	*	Is it an ad? If so, I'm probably blocking it, because they never ask me. 
t1_duru1on	1	*	I didn't even think to burn his photo til now. Now I want to find a photo of him to burn..

t1_duhkfng	0	*	No, the title isnimplyinf that the study only covered the last ~1500 years, data before that time are not available at resolutions high enough to be reliable. 
t1_duff23r	1	*	He had multiple attacks commited on him in public, almost lost an eye, was arrested and sentenced several times but deemed innocent by European Human Rights court and his brother is in jail for absolutely ridiculous fake offense.
t1_duff230	1	*	And all these memos seem to get leaked.
t1_duiy478	1	*	It's actually 700million sgd and frankly adding this to the budget of infrastructure maintenance/upgrade is rather insignificant as the budget for that is already very high.   In short, we won't miss that 700 million bucks. 
t1_dudvnj2	1	*	Its a shame that we are making tens of thousands of beautiful species extinct. Also, its something to see it, another to know that you are causing it.
t1_dulmxlu	0	*	Thats all some people do all day though.
t1_duol5vp	0	*	well yes - if you could trust your cops there would be no excuse for people to have guns for protection, so you could get rid of pistols. Then you just have to convince people that they don't need machine guns to hunt pigs ffs. 
t1_dur6cu6	1	*	No, this is good. In fact it's excellent, this is what will topple the dictatorship, since Maduro will have to start giving a shit about the people, as he won't have another source of income
t1_duib1zv	1	*	To be fair, the Oracle at Delphi was high the entire time. So accuracy is not to be expected.

t1_duhs67l	1	*	HOW CAN SHE SLAP? 
t1_duqocgx	0	*	It's also crap oil. Heavy crude with high levels of sulphur and vanadium. You essentially have to use a refinery configured specifically for that oil.  Because its such a low-grade oil, it brings less money. With the political headaches, it's becoming not worth the effort.  And now, buyers are rejecting shipments that have contaminants.  https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-oil-insight/venezuelas-deteriorating-oil-quality-riles-major-refiners-idUSKBN1CN2EO   
t1_duqd5n9	1	*	NASA started their own TV channel - conservatives pushed to privatize it, and later it started producing *Honey Boo Boo*  This is what they do.
t1_dujq1bi	1	*	> keep track everytime Trump contradicts himself  Aka what made The Daily Show great in the first place. Calling out hypocrisy and contradictory statements in both parties and across all media.
t1_duk0soi	1	*	You're willingly obfuscating facts wth your interpretation of the I don't believe comment. This was after the election, after his inauguration, and after he began receiving daily intelligence briefings. At the point he says I don't believe they interfered, he is essentially saying I don't believe the USIC when they say Russia interfered.
t1_dueq5oj	1	*	Dont know why youre being downvoted, youre right.
t1_dun4l3x	1	*	Always a good game brother!  See you again in 4!
t1_dudh0ja	1	*	I think Twitter thinks I'm a bot because I don't respond to the sarcasm of strangers. I hate fighting online (or in person) and aim for rational discussion. #mustbearobot
t1_dujlnca	1	*	You can fly if you want. Just buy a ticket to the country if your choice. 
t1_duy3f9u	1	*	It's a EU case based on EU and UK laws.  You have no 'right to be forgotten' in the US so you won't see a flood of similar cases here.  In the EU, OTOH, the article reports Google has at least 2.4M requests to remove links under the policy.
t1_durc7x9	0	*	What happens?
t1_dusnqej	1	*	Obama already did that. It was annoying.
t1_duhsuir	0	*	The law grants drug makers exclusive rights to produce and sell their drugs for 20 years before generics can be made. Basically no one would be developing new drugs if other companies could just immediately undercut them without spending any money on R&D.
t1_dumirzd	0	*	They are ex-employees, but regardless, it isn't like Russia cares specifically that Trump is president. They want chaos and for the U.S. to become less effectual. They've accomplished that, and basically all paths forward mean more disorder and confusion. It is just a question of what is the quickest way out.

t1_duegukr	0	*	Nah we wanted them to raise their defense spending effectively to bolster our Alliance. Instead they're going to fund a bunch of jobs programs and continue to leech off American taxpayers as they have since the end of WW2. Spare me the bullshit over money.  FYI America buys plenty of European hardware.
t1_dugr3rc	0	*	It's about putting the brakes on social mobility.  This isn't about good policy.

t1_dutgdwz	1	*	Currently not much is known, article will be updated as more information becomes available  Officers have said they are conducting a search and rescue operation at the scene.
t1_dul9ru9	1	*	You have to remember it's not just Russia. Half of our news is fear mongering right wing crap and the other half is libtard bullshit. Either that or it's fluff. Trying to fill a 24 hour news cycle, paid advertising during news hours and Rupert Murdock have done more harm to the country than Russia ever will. Pile Reddit, Twitter and Facebook on top now here we are.

t1_duh7aas	0	*	I still find it weird that mammoths were strolling around while the pyramids were being built (in different places).        Do we need to be worried about viruses, bacteria or disease that has been frozen for millennia thawing out and becoming airborne?

t1_duykev6	1	*	>It's interesting to see just how many 'Russian propaganda artists' are active in the comments.   Or paranoid users who think someone who disagrees is a Russian propaganda artist.
t1_duod20r	1	*	If you read the articlr, you'll see that it points out that the first people were probably largely killed off and weakened by disease and climate change. So in this case, the new wave of immigration probably saved whatever culture there was left.

Some may view the Southern states in the US as a thorn in the progress of the US, but people would still have a really tough time accepting another country invading and annexing them. 
t1_duffs25	0	*	More like N Korea is playing them like a fiddle. First you detonate a couple of nuclear bombs and then launch a few of ballistic missiles.   Soon enough, when you suggest you wanna be friends, everyone will cozy up to you out of fear of what you might do if they aren't nice to you. Like an abusive spouse.

t1_dudravu	0	*	buy a lwayer  and guns  and money
t1_duqjefr	0	*	My biggest concern is that much of the valut that is used is owned by companies like Monsanto.  We need a stockpile of heirloom varieties and genetic diversity.  Many modern hybrids lack the ability to successfully grow several generations from one plant.

t1_dumua9b	1	*	It's a bit risky.  We may want to do a test run with something less dangerous than guns first.  If everyone is given a monthly supply of their drug of choice I bet we could reduce the number of drug dealers.  Hey, that may reduce the demand for guns as a side effect.   I may be on to something here.  I may have a few ideas for reducing the number of pimps out there too.  My3rdTesticle 2020!

t1_duqd4tx	0	*	Its about sovereignty. Palestinians were offered many times to participate in Israeli democracy but they refused every offer. Now years have passed and they don't have sovereignty and they don't have an offer. Essentially there are two ideological camps. One side believes Arabs should be able to participate in a democracy with Jews, and the other side believes Arabs should never cooperate with Jews. The Palestinians have made themselves the rope in this ideological tug-of-war.
t1_dus0vgi	1	*	Yes, let's allow Al-Qaeda and Ex-ISIS affiliates to take over and create a failed state instead :)  Allah Souria Bashar w Bas
t1_dud4njk	1	*	Apparently they can't be extradited due to their constituton.
t1_dulys15	1	*	I think that's the main point to take away from this, but instead people end up using it as evidence to support their side. The facts is that Russians organized anti-trump rallys and pro-trump rallies. The media went to those rallies and promoted them. The American media and public is so complicit in their own demise in regards to this russian memeing. 
t1_duqh55b	1	*	I mean, being profitable is generally the goal of corporate partners.  That's a good thing, because it means people can affect their behavior through spending choices

t1_duj5by0	1	*	The whole video is literally a parody with the idea that if you don't vote, the world can literally become anything. The video itself tries to be as unrealistic as possible.   The fact that people try to make it look real is just a real shame and anti-Russian propaganda if you ask me.

Trump said on Wednesday that the United States should take the oil in Iraq as part of the spoils of war and to keep it out of the hands of ISIS. Ive always said, shouldnt be there, but if were going to get out, take the oil, he said. If we would have taken the oil, you wouldnt have ISIS, because ISIS formed with the power and the wealth of that oil.

If we just take every oil rig that is billions of tons of carbon.  There would need to be machines pumping carbon back into the ground at that rate all the time.  That would put us even.

t1_dudv2kc	1	*	Its not about making money, its about bettering the prospects of paying off investments or in this case, the acquiring of a company. I dont get how everyone here can be so stupid that they dont understand it, is it because youre Americans?
t1_duw97w9	1	*	Trump could kill someone in front of his tower in the middle of the day and his supporters would still kiss his ass
t1_dutwfvr	0	*	To be fair this isn't being caused by rising temperatures, it's a separate result of increasing CO2 concentration.
t1_dugpwtk	1	*	Our best qualities isn't record food stamps and the worst economic recovery since WW2.
t1_duk052k	1	*	This argument highly obfuscates the point and paints your perspective in a bitter light. You missed the idea here. I could say the same thing he did and no one would care. He's saying it because he actually has clout with media and politics. In addition, higher taxes on the rich would actually pretty much be him paying us (including all other rich people too).  Look up logical fallacies and educate yourself.
t1_dutjn0s	1	*	I partially agree with this. The major vaccines like chicken pox and polio etc. Should all be mandatory  Flu vaccine has never worked for me. I get vaccine, I still end up with the flu. No vaccine, I don't get it usually. The strain that hits my area is never the one that the shot takes care of.  I'm also talking about a super small town. I don't know what it would be like for higher population density or anywhere with houses less than 50 feet away from each other

It's really quite scary.
t1_dujhfcr	0	*	Yeah I don't agree with this either. Idk why everyone is so happy about it.  The dudes poor and now he's gonna be living on the street or jail. Makes sense.   Edit: just reread. Monthly income of 24k. Fuck that guy

t1_dued0rg	1	*	I kept telling people this would happen since we would be begging for trade deals with bigger powers who know we are desperate and will push for stuff that the EU wouldn't allow.   But it was shrugged off all the time, it's a situation where it hurts to much to say I told you so.
t1_dugsdej	1	*	Talk about some self righteous bullshit lol
t1_duggjnh	0	*	irrelevant. He countered the criticism that was thrown against him with something that might be true and might make sense, therefore it's enough. If you're a fan of him, you don't actually want to check if the counter-argument actually makes sense, because that might lead to you realizing that you got scammed. The quick reassurance that there seems to be some counter-argument is the only thing you want to feel better.

t1_dubqkmt	1	*	While the bot and troll problem is real, so is the failure of tech giants to do anything meaningful or even intelligent about it.
t1_ducpk1i	0	*	They've been building their cover story for a while.  1) The FBI is corrupt. For Democrats.   2) Mueller's team is biased. Based on cherry picked personal texts of people who had been removed from the investigation long ago.   3) The deep state is out to get them.   4) If the Russian's interfered, why is that such a big deal. We do it too.   5) The Russian's helped both sides.

t1_dulszyj	1	*	Has that changed recently? I did my leaving cert in 2005, so it was just before it became a leaving cert subject. But we learnt absolutely nothing about anything that wasn't Christian. Lots about catholic church, reformation and then church of England due to the troubles, but not a work about Islam, Judaism et al.

t1_duwt8ia	1	*	Well, yes but CO2 isn't the only thing we should focus on. I'd actually say CO2 gets a bit too much attention. If they reduce CO2 by essentially just finding alternative way to pollute the air then that certainly can't be the solution.

t1_dutip8t	1	*	You're thinking of a 'hive mind'. There is no such thing as self-regulating. That implies some design. Evolution does not design anything, it's just what survives.  And everything dies. Death does not have to find a way, which again is an event, not a conscious being.

t1_dupaxn8	0	*	The federal government doesn't pay teachers. Your property taxes do. Raise property taxes. Where I live we pay our teachers very well and our property taxes are high as a result.   This doesn't have to be a big thing done by the federal government. This is something that can be changed at the county level. This can easily be changed by local protest and votes.
t1_duvg58f	1	*	Seems about right to me. Don't forget 500 people traveled to Syria from the UK, they are bound to have people supporting them at home and there are bound to be people who don't want to leave etc.. Then add in all the far-right suspects too.

t1_dur915r	1	*	According to Wikipedia, the mercs get paid 80k-250k/month depending on location of deployment. According to Google, a Russian general only get paid ~30k/mo, a regular soldier only get paid ~10k/mo.   So it would be pretty easy for them to argue they get paid what they signed up for.

The only gains in exporting socialism and preserving it in other countries is having cultural and economic exchange. I believe in the friendship of peoples under communism.
t1_duo6lj9	1	*	> USCIS secures Americas promise as a nation of immigrants   What nation is not a nation of immigrants? People have moved to different regions of the world for thousands of years. For example, the Portuguese language is a mix of Iberian, Celtic, visigothic, Phoenician and Arabic to name a few influences. It's nothing special to be a nation of immigrants.
t1_dum8pnn	0	*	Nice source there. Too bad it doesn't mention anything about your accusation.  By the way, no country is under obligation to share intel, and the fact that Israel did for a country that doesn't even recognize its right to exist is telling.  Only you could find fault in this.

t1_duwopwz	0	*	Lived in QC my whole life, everything you said is spot on. I moved to Calgary a few years ago and the difference is incredible. Easy to get a family doctor, clinics everywhere, you literally can be in and out of a clinic in 15-20 mins just by walking in. Wait times for non life threatening surgeries and procedures are the same rediculous 1-2 year wait, though.

t1_dupp6zs	1	*	this must be the great education system at work
t1_duhs6qp	1	*	The more you degree contributes later in terms of taxes and giving back to society, the cheaper it should be. Not the opposite.  So studying stuff like engineering, medicine and science should be free. While stuff like art history or women studies should cost a lot.
t1_duuvbq6	1	*	Not really, the due process is an issue, but there are alot of valid reasons behind them from pressure and upper echelon of society using pressure to quiet dissent.   There are bad and good coming from this movement. And Korea is one country that needs this movement to push alot of the issues to the forefront.

t1_duwcsqi	1	*	This. Bacterial resistance is commonly blamed on human use, when the issue is primarily agricultural use. Yes, antibiotics are often over prescribed in humans for viral colds, or for sinus and ear infections that will topically resolve on their own without antibiotics, but this is not the primary cause of resistance. Animals on high doses of antibiotics to compensate for filthy, crowded conditions prior to slaughter is the problem that needs to be addressed first.

t1_ducxvou	1	*	What successful plan only has one piece?  Not many, not mine either.   Trump/Russia could be a totally separate program.   It makes more sense to attack with propaganda while working with Trump to get him in than it does to totally believe that is vindicates him.  I'm not saying he is guilty, I'm just saying it is naive to think this makes Trump/Russia difficult to sell.   I was Putin and working with Trump would I also run a misinformation campaign?  Yes.

Gosh, I just feel like extremely wealthy people who go on to say these things, with charities and all that, are doing it purely because they want to be seen on the right side of things so people won't decry them and as to secure their still massively unequal wealth.

t1_duco8sq	0	*	I think these indictments have two purposes:  - Basically put these individuals and companies on blast to the world, regardless if you actually get them to surrender. - They are part of a larger case that shows coordination between both Russian and American individuals to undermine the election.
t1_duqh1qj	0	*	Yes, you could send them food. It would be good idea to show support to those workers, however, I don't know how that could be done.  What I do know is that there are cases where food shipped to people in Venezuela is constantly robbed by customs officials. You could take the risk and send some.

t1_duchxud	1	*	VOCs are a ridiculously large umbrella class of compounds whose only common property is that they easily vaporize at ambient air pressure & temperature. Literally all smells fall into the category of VOCs and that's still only a subsection of the larger class.  Typically when talking about VOC's in the context of pollution they are referring to the subsection of VOC's that have a greenhouse effect. Confusing I know, but most laymen only encounter the term VOC in that or a health context.
t1_dunuy3g	0	*	The 816 number is a little high too given what the classification of a mass shooting is.  Two gangs have a shootout and that is logged as a mass shooting.  The people killed are no less dead, but there is a big difference in the cause.  The media and politicians use mass shooting to bring to mind things like Columbine and Las Vegas, but they also include two gangs in a turf war to give their numbers more weight.

They just made everything up from more than 100 years ago. They didn't have real recordings or reliable instruments. They just made up all those numbers so they could keep getting paid to record them now.  There's absolutely nothing that will ever change his mind.

t1_dur3r8u	0	*	As if China wasn't doing that itself for millennia before.  No, China doesn't get to play the victim of imperialism card.  And being a victim isn't some kind of free pass to then do the same shit to someone else.

t1_duoglnz	1	*	But it is in the news now and probably getting more discussion, so it did work, the only reason terrorism works, is because the media then spread their messages; be that death to infidels or change migration policy.

At this point I was accustomed to getting high grades and applied those memorization skills toward future grades. That statement really resonated with me and still does.

France responded by sending a Destroyer, to which Brazil responded by sending an Aircraft Carrier + Escorts and flying bombers off a nearby airfield that would fly close to the French ship in order to harass it. No shots were fired though, and the matter was solved in Brazil's favour in an international court.

t1_dupifv9	1	*	You need to read more comments...
t1_duv8ii2	0	*	It's Japan so I'm not sure that they will abandon it  like Brazil did, also they could probably make profit off of it for years like Calgary Olympic park.
t1_duw29ay	1	*	Well... when you have one (breathing) you may not have the other (heartbeat) and vice versa.   She was over 50 and who knows what lifestyle choices she made.   So if she was in a bath and had chest pain and died its plausible.   Just like if she passed out from an OD and then asphyxiated and then arrested.   Skys the limit.  Too bad though, either way. 
t1_durt87a	1	*	I think this kind of response reaches to a deep fear humans have about their existence.  People like this may think that God is always in control, and it can't be true that humans have this much of an effect on the place we live.  If they admit humans are damaging the environment and only human action can solve it it's like they're admitting God isn't there.  And that is the scariest thing for many people because God is like this emotional shield against existential uncertainty.  
t1_dum7fxh	1	*	Fuckin finally
t1_duqzb8k	1	*	I know it's not meant literally, but I really hope they throw a book at his face.
t1_dut6bpd	1	*	We could do with another horde right about now.  I'm just saying.
t1_duw64c0	0	*	As someone who has family that has struggled with addiction, I know what you're going through. Something that helped me was attending what was basically AA / NA groups for family and friends of addicts. See if you can find a Nar-Anon group in your area and check it out. Sorry to hear about your brother, and I hope you find some peace of mind
t1_duyib5f	1	*	Ha hes done now lol lmao!! say victims like yourself. And the investigation continues, as it should. 
t1_dum7tmq	1	*	Typical US game, they smudge everyone that is not in line with their political agenda, and since they have so much influence, the western countries and wanna be international elites flock to its side. 
t1_dueucgw	1	*	Please explain. I occasionally see this Soros hate pop up but the people never explain why. (In Thailand and uk i can understand after shorting the pound & baht.)
t1_dupiiju	1	*	Lowering taxes do grow the economy, the problem ( one of thousands) is the republicans spending. You cant cut revenue, then increase spending. Borrowing leads to inflation and interest hikes which are essentially taxes.
t1_duzbxxd	1	*	Reminds me of how I wanted an iPod for years. My parents finally got me the state of the art: a brand new 20GB basic iPod. The next year, my sister got an iPod video. Same story. If you wait for everyone else to develop the technology and modernize it, you can get the shiny new stuff for cheap while everyone else is stuck with the outdated model that they spend forever developing. 
t1_dup6ph0	0	*	I don't know, I think most comments are pretty reasonable. 
t1_duq7rfp	0	*	If you belive this bullshit you are an idiot. Convenient time to bring the NRA into this matter. Liberal agenda is so obvious.

t1_duypr4j	1	*	Wow... 
t1_dunmjvx	1	*	It's 2 years. That's not really that a lot of time to completely switch from one format to another, including all the lark involved in setting up new suppliers, and them being able to source enough material and arrange enough labour to produce it all. 
t1_dui8lqf	1	*	Honestly if your young and smart, there's more opportunities abroad, there's no reason for you to bust your ass for dubpar and declining quality of life seen in the UK. I left and hand on heart it was one of the best decisions I've ever made in my life. 
t1_duf72xf	0	*	They are both responsible. Google and Facebook feed you based on your previous search history. If you look up nothing but anti-trump videos you will find nothing but anti-Trump vids recommended to you. Makes you think everyone has nothing but positive things to say.

t1_dun7pvc	0	*	Have you ever seen students make a teacher cry in the middle of class? I have. What happens when a teacher snaps one day while teaching and pulls their gun out and starts firing into the class? What happens when a student gets the drop on the teacher, relieves him of his gun and uses it on someone? 
t1_dujhodi	0	*	He lies and then denies that lie and then denies that lie and then denies that lie and then...
t1_duc8nqq	0	*	China treating all foreign companies the same by using restrictions to promote its industries = unfair and needs to be stopped  US, EU, JP using targeted restrictions against only certain countries = fair  Same old same old

t1_duhti1a	0	*	Us scots have hated this bloody country for centuries
t1_dul6p0g	0	*	Russians also tried disinformation warfare during the cold war. The reason why its so effective today is internet social media giving the Russians direct access to the American psyche.

t1_dudtt6s	0	*	Papxe1? 
t1_dumtxnt	0	*	Countries like Brazil criminalize a lot of activities that are perfectly legal in the US.  For example, a lot of times you hear about a company in the US being found guilty of something.  In Brazil, it would be the individuals that would be prosecuted.  The Brazilians beefed up their anticorruption laws in the 90s.  The result is that virtually every politician is afoul of the law.
t1_dus3ggz	1	*	I don't know this, I didn't research it, but I'm sure a lot of Italians had weapons when Mussolini came to power. Actually it was the Italian republic, after 1947 that confiscated the majority of weapons. My grandparents and their families had weapons in the 40s... That didn't stop Mussolini, because he had the support of the majority of Italians and of the police. 
t1_duxi07x	1	*	They have precogs. Their names are google and facebook.
t1_duxj75n	1	*	No....shitty leadership made this happen. Crappy policy comes from within, otherwise you give the Right another thing to blame Trumps blunders on. 
t1_dupfkaf	1	*	This really gets to the heart of it. Even if the armed teacher kills the kid before they get any shots off... that's still one dead kid. Every politician who supports teachers with guns is saying that continued widespread access to firearms is worth *at least* one dead child (per school shooting, of course- of which there are depressingly many).
t1_dugcyns	1	*	Most of them just walked in from Egypt, before there was a fence on the border. They just crossed the border and waited for the army to pick them up (since they weren't allowed to return them to Egypt, they had no choice).  It reached about 200 a night at some point - hence the fence.
t1_duprh9q	1	*	Sure :)

t1_dupmvmx	0	*	This is not true, though. Working hours are 40+, 24+ vacation day is correct, and there's no blocking of emails. Minumum wage is at 8,50, millions don't make enough to feed their familiy. A number of people grab recycling bottles from rubbish bins to make a few coins and so on. 
t1_due4mbt	0	*	I agree reunification would be a great out come, but if North Korean dictatorship doesn't hands over power back to the people I don't think it will ever happen.
t1_dutgcup	1	*	Not just out of sight, but often in other peoples waters. Why would the US stop fishing when the Chinese are taking those fish anyway? Theres no way to stop competition and, therefore, the countries are all going to blame the other ones.

t1_dumgu0c	1	*	The AR 15 that kid in Florida used was NOT an assault rifle. The AR 15 is NOT an automatic weapon. 
t1_duykogc	1	*	Out of all the horrible things that have occurred in the world and have had movies based on them, this would be the one I wouldn't want to watch. I need off this ride when it's over, not back on lol
t1_dublhc3	0	*	China are awesome reverse-engineers but utterly useless inovators.  
t1_dulkbns	1	*	Yep, the MSM, Intelligence agencies, and Politicians are masters at framing any opposition to the status quo as being an enemy of America. You people are falling right into the Neo-con Bill kristol and Max Boots hands

t1_duszrsk	0	*	Truly the stupidest argument, if you think you and your shitty AR15 stand a chance against any government in the world you are a complete fool. This is just a shit argument from gun apologists.
t1_dujitcy	1	*	I didn't do anything wrong, cause you should've stopped me 
t1_dug6qgb	1	*	I'll bet Trump is pissed, he was all geared up for a shooting war.

t1_dutts7p	0	*	Emp?
t1_dud67sy	1	*	It should be possible to genetically modify a microorganism, such as yeast, to produce this protein en masse. And once the microorganism has been modified there shouldn't be any carbon emissions, the yeast would merely require the base components of the protein:  > We found protein was a useful tool to generate hydrogen in a lab without using a fossil fuel, the professor said.

t1_dum67wc	1	*	Edgy...
t1_duim3w3	1	*	It's comical to still see extremists holding out for the mythical collusion pipe dream evidence to finally show up. I suppose it's easier than simply admitting that you've been brainwashed by the media using the entire Russia thing to sell boner pills and gin up ratings.

t1_dugyroq	1	*	Keep saying that but his tweets have proven to age well
t1_duekpno	1	*	Why do you think Jewish people exist? It's not because they thought hey, I agree with this specific religion. They come from and originate from the Middle East (where the Jews come from) and it's simply passed down from parents to children over hundreds of years.  They are distinct from surrounding European populations because they do not have the same origins as them.
t1_dun9zkb	0	*	Same in pretty much all of Western Europe and China.  Edit: Right wingers downvoting facts. They truly are sane and reasonable human beings. :)

t1_duyrrt4	1	*	Mueller obtained 6 guilty pleas and almost 20 indictments.  Why is crooked Trump surrounded by corrupt Russian agents?  Why has Trump not told the NSA to retaliate against Russia cyber interference that Trump himself admits happened?  Why has Trump not enforced Russia sanctions the both the house and senate overwhelmingly passed?

t1_duqa1id	0	*	I agree with you but if they really had a role we can't just dismiss that
t1_duwzpfq	1	*	It's equality in a sense. Just think of white people being brought down to the level other races have historically experienced, instead of bringing all other races up to the level where we could have a utopia.  The first one is easier to do that the second. 
t1_duhfrzf	1	*	Self reflection for Trump's base boils down to: we're pissing off those librul Europeans, so we must be doing something right.

t1_dub2mig	1	*	No. The problem was the guns. We got rid of them. Problem solved.  There are not 'plenty of guns' here. If you live rurally you might have a rifle - single shot or shotgun. To own a handgun you need a shitload of licensing and even then most guns are locked up at gun clubs not in people's homes.  The US has a problem with guns. Stop trying to avoid the issue.

t1_dua63ea	1	*	So there are a few varieties of influenza with A and B causing most human infections. Think of that as species (ie human, neanderthal...)   The HxNx making convention refers to the types of haemagglutin and neuraminidase present in the virus. They are just two proteins or antigens that can identify that particular virus. Think of that as it's name (ie John Smith).  As with names being more popular in different countries, the H and N can vary based on the usual host a virus infects.

With some luck and good investigative work a new House and Senate majority will have plenty of evidence to level impeachment proceedings upon Trump in next Jan.

t1_duaq2g2	0	*	> Did anyone really expect that Putin was so staunchly supporting Assad out of the goodness of his heart and for the concern of the Syrian people?  Literally no one made that argument. Putin is in Syria because 1) Assad needed him and told him to do and 2) Syria is a longtime Russian ally and serves Russia's geostrategic interests.  States don't do anything for moral or ethical purposes. Everything is based on interests. Anyone that says otherwise is a moron.

t1_dulk69i	1	*	Funny shit is that, consuming alcohol is still a much glorified activity, especially among young people. I often hear people *bragging* about being shitfaced x times a week, or being able to consume y amount of alcohol without puking everywhere, while the people who don't drink nor smoke are the ones being looked down upon.

t1_duwxvv6	1	*	the biggest change to hydro is pumped storage, where they pump water up hill at night when the grid is swimming in energy because the windmills crank it out, and no one is using it.  Then they let the water flow during peak times.  These days worldwide pumped storage is well over 100 GW, or enough power to provide peak power to 8 New York City sized cities.  China and Japan are leading the way.  Most of that info is almost a decade old, so it is almost surely more by now.
t1_dutrpyq	0	*	The guy is in US witness protection.  The Russians are trying to pull him out of witness protection with this lawsuit.

t1_duqun4r	0	*	This technically is a check and balance, Trump is the commander and chief so he has the ability to do this as long as he's not declaring war. For Congress to go against that would be a violation of checks and balances. Whether or not it's right is a different story.

t1_dunpthf	0	*	I know right, fortunately in the US there are numerous checks & balances designed to fight against the presidency if it is deemed dangerous or unfit.

The claim of 'distraction from his domestic problems' is infantile to say the least.
t1_dum34z3	1	*	Ehh, yes. Everyone should be concerned to be democratized by the US, because usually that means thousands, or hundred thousands, civilians have to die. But luckily the Philippines don't have any oil, or other major resources, so they are less likely to being democratized.

t1_duqlhej	1	*	Chip! No!
t1_dujak7w	1	*	My understanding is that along with their Russian version of machismo that Putin is famous for exuding, there are a lot of homoerotic aspects to it as well.

t1_dujoqem	0	*	Automatic grenade launchers.  Fucking hilarious weapon.  Nevermind launching a couple of grenades every minute via an m79 or an m203, but literally hundreds per minute.  When it absolutely must die: automatic grenade launchers!
t1_dueka11	0	*	Kim gonna try ban it. Citizens revolt. Kim tries to make it as a kpop star in last ditch effort.
t1_dui37ol	1	*	I was just there over new year's with my national friend. It survived, there are some laws in place to try to ensure records are kept and taxes paid. I remember all restaraunt menus said if you didn't get a check/reciept you didn't have to pay. Apparently waitstaff used to just verbally give the bill and everything was under the table.  But then again the athen's metro is free if your ballsy enough, anarchists destroyed the glass barriers that were on the gates.
t1_duf8enq	1	*	I'm with you. If rehabilitation is possible, let's make every effort to to rehabilitate someone so they can become a healthy, productive member of society. But if someone hurts someone I care about, I don't want them to be rehabilitated; I want them to be contained.

t1_dup6hcb	1	*	That's because Authoritarianism and Communism is evil and Japanese people can fish whatever they want because they are Democratic Capitalists and markets regulate themselves.  DUH!
t1_dulnwa9	0	*	Ive wondered this as well, my mom and father had me when they both hadent graduated college and worked minimum wage jobs, they proceeded to have 2 more kids. Then want me to feel greatful for how hard they worked. At a basic level I do feel greatful, but why bring us into the world, if you couldnt adequately take care of yourselves.
t1_duunx18	1	*	Wtf anonymous, alleged, US officials with your unsubstantiated rumors.   Getting real tired of your shit.
t1_duswoet	1	*	Yeah, because a two party deep state run by billionaires is really such an improvement

t1_dudobf7	0	*	People are hateful because we're told every single day why we should hate each other. Black people are dangerous criminals. White people are racist murderers. Hispanics are all illegals. The police are deranged killers. The goverment is run why a white supremacist. Liberals are snowflakes. Republicans are nazis and so on, and so forth.  The divisiveness never fucking ends.

t1_duxbq59	1	*	Likely. George Washington did some pretty terrible stuff in his time, especially towards native Americans, with the name Town destroyer being given by the Iroquois. But if he rose from the dead he'd likely win by a landslide in an election.
t1_duc1x6q	1	*	All patents held by Chinese domestic companies are the property of the Communist Party of China. So they are using this as an excuse to steal inventions from international companies.

t1_duf6ui6	1	*	The priests did horrible shit no question but maybe your friend should actually read the bible. Tons of horrible shit is in there,permitted, and sometimes encouraged: murder,rape, slavery to name a few.   Im not trying to be insensitive about the situation but if something like this puts a dent in their faith (id agree that it should) then i dont think they actually know the beliefs that they had.
t1_dujaf4z	0	*	You have Russian officers dabbing. Of course it's a parody. That people don't get it so hard is ridiculous.
t1_dud97po	0	*	So let me get this narrative right: Clinton was a bad candidate, so the Republicans won, but then the Republicans decided they didn't want the Presidency, so they appoint a Special Counsel to investigate themselves?

t1_dut7snz	1	*	He said at the Peoples Congress that he wanted to bring the party back to communism so this may just be his first step to doing so. No body (myself included) believed he could do half the shit he wanted to let alone make China communist (again/for the first time depending on who you ask). Well just have to wait and see if China turns into a pseudo-capitalist dictatorship or a communist dictatorship. 
t1_duxnwoh	0	*	Western media told me that the hijab is actually feminist.  Therefore I can only assume that the people protesting against the hijab in Iran are misogynist alt-right nazis. Why should I care if nazis get jailed?
t1_duvk78y	1	*	Its both.  The tourists are creating more trash, and the locals have no good way of getting rid of it. 
t1_dudnao6	0	*	I just finished watching the new Netflix Docu series called Dirty Money and one of the episodes was dedicated to companies like this. Makes you want to vomit with how disgustingly greedy these people can be.

t1_dul65qe	0	*	Or - maybe - people just have different opinions and blaming EVERYTHING which does not toe the official line on bots - its fucking absurd propaganda.  And it is.
t1_dujg9jb	0	*	Worst part is the average American is just taking it instead of protesting and taking to the streets. Makes you wonder what else their leaders could do to them. Conditioning goes a long way

t1_duf0etn	1	*	Net Neutrality would protect social media sites from damages as they are not the owners of the content, just the conduit.

t1_duw6zhs	1	*	They could also just have withdrawn a certain amount needed for one crop, then redeposit this amount. Not all plants grow well in those climates and national seed banks normally don't exist for conservation but for agricultural purposes.
t1_duxhy7u	1	*	You know what makes me crazy? The news. Climate change should be the top story, every day. All the other drama is secondary. People fighting over religion and wondering who's going to win best actor, wondering if AI is taking over. People. We're going down if we don't start paying attention. It's not the elephant in the room. It's the room.

Never forget, open air slave markets is always better than no democracy at all! Gotta spread that ~~abrahamic religion~~ ideology that is the only one that is acceptable.  Next up, Assad and Syria!!

t1_duqer5p	1	*	But anti gun advocates are really communists in disguise!!   Ok. NRA. Whatever the fuck you say.
t1_duysdd6	0	*	It goes back to politics, and the fact that history is an important part of politics.  Plus, even the Bible stated the sins of the father pass on to the son.
t1_dugpyl1	0	*	Just so happens that he's President Bozo.
t1_duwdeiu	1	*	It is more of a dictatorship than anything else
t1_dubqn86	0	*	>Does this seem familiar to anyone?  Nope. Today it's literal, confirmed *fact* that Russia meddled in a US election.  That *should* be an absolute, delegitimising crisis. The fact that we're *not* reacting extremely harshly and are actually *lifting* sanctions on Russia, is nothing less than *absolutely fucking scandalous*.

t1_durbph0	1	*	No, Communism doesn't even work in an ideal society. It is explicitly authoritarian, in violating the right of people to engage in voluntary economic interactions with other consenting adults, and to keep what they produce or receive in private trade as their own private property.

t1_dum70h4	1	*	As awful as communist Russia was, at least they actually stood for something. At the base of it, they thought that a socialist world would make things a better place for everyone.  Putin just wants to stay incredibly rich and wants his 20 oligarch buddies to stay rich too. It's depressing. 
t1_dumzq3f	1	*	This is happening to all of you right now in this thread lol. 
t1_dubinlr	0	*	You hit the nail on the head, their aim is to sow division among the American population, thereby eroding public trust and confidence in government.  For example, during the NFL flag kneeling debate Russian twitter accounts promoted opposing sides in order to fan the flames.  Russia could care less about gun rights in America, any topic that divides American citizens and/or weakens the United States is fair game.

t1_duny07v	1	*	Yeah I had this same thought.  During the summer (which is effectively over half the year in Texas), drinks in plastic and paper cups warm up really, really fast.  Styrofoam is a much better insulator.  Hopefully there is a more environmentally responsible variant of styrofoam that can be introduced. 
t1_duvswll	0	*	Um - not really. Its because as it heats up - it releases more. The process in other words causes more of the problem that caused it in the first place.   Its a feed back loop.
t1_duq9s6n	0	*	Ya, I doubt a curler would intentionally dope to sabotage himself with virtually nothing to gain.
t1_duibc8k	1	*	Flat taxes are highly regressive, meaning they punish the middle to low earners far more than higher earners (like me).   10% of the million bucks a year I earn in income is chump change to me, it wouldnt affect how I live whatsoever.   10% of $30,000 a year in income means your rent isnt getting paid or someone isnt eating. Big difference.

t1_duqpshs	1	*	I remember the forest fires in Sumatra a few years ago created a massive cloud of smog that blew all the way to my home near Kuala Lumpur. Blocked out the sun, reduced visibility to shit and had an Air Pollution Index so high that schools were forced to close for a few days. Then the Indonesian authorities had the gall to claim their forests were producing oxygen for Malaysia too in the newspapers. Those were interesting times ...

t1_dushrss	0	*	Hopefully shorter than 3 years if Mueller bears fruit, though a President Pence or President Paul Ryan would actually be worse since the GOP has fully revealed they have the same terrible ideology as Trump. So it would be Trump's ideology with a competent president until 2020. 
t1_duiyltd	1	*	Bribery. Hes announcing it at the same time as an increase in GST. Taking drumstick but giving out peanuts
t1_duujds5	1	*	We can do NOTHING. The great traditional bureaucratic system is just over there. The situation can't changed by us. And we don't need do any extreme actions because our daily lives haven't been destroyed, If life go on as  usual just accept It. But the important thing is that we must help the ones surrounding us be more sensitive and careful about politics. Be worried but keep calm.
t1_dusssbh	0	*	At what point do conservatives remember how much our economic infrastructure runs through Mexico. They may be a poorer nation but we still run a mass amount of goods to and from daily and that gives them cards to play. Ya can't just go around pissing of your neighbors. Soon enough  one is going to get pissed and call the cops. Unavoidable.

The First Amendment, however, still applies to your uncle.

t1_dugywp1	1	*	Its not meant for you. Its meant to keep the American people distracted and talking about the stupid things he says instead of the ongoing news about the stupid things he and Putins other lackeys have done. Because the American people are easily distracted.

t1_dui8bbh	1	*	While I feel like it's in its infancy, I believe the divide between the upper class and the poor is going to become so large that the middle class just ceases to exist. You either live incredibly well above your means, or are barely scrapping by.

t1_dulbt97	0	*	Well naturally youll get more attention if you post offensive things to get people riled up on both sides. CNN loves to do this. Pay 1 racist right wing nut job to say all Mexicans should be deported and then have 10 other anchors argue with that person.

t1_dummkv8	1	*	I mean the state pays millions for the schools stadiums. Just thinking about some of my high school teachers having guns for my protection is a scary thought though. But then again, my school also shared a police officer with the other 2 schools in the district so he was only at the school a few hours each day, some days maybe not at all. SCHOOLS NEED ARMED POLICE DURING HOURS. NOT TEACHERS. 
t1_duwwsrp	1	*	Exactly.  Criminalizing addictive behavior will just cause people to enter a cycle of abuse and arrest which they typically aren't able to excape from.
t1_dur3koe	0	*	I know it's bad in those countries, but comparing with the USD is misleading. $1 is worth way more here than it is in the US. I can two full meals for $1.

t1_dux28b9	0	*	Because unlike Germany they were pretty much left alone regarding their remembrance culture. And it sure is nicer to say 'it was war, things happen' than having to admit that there were crimes comitted.  And yes, it makes a difference. We have way more neo nazis in East Germany, where denazification never really took place than in West Germany. Sure, there are other factors as well, but this is still a big one.
t1_dun3q97	0	*	Yet we have no problems touching door handles and money that have been touched by hundreds of people, then use those hands to grab chips and burgers.

t1_dua4xyy	0	*	When you glorify shooters as minor celebrities and drench them in the martyrdom of 24-hour news coverage, you give very vulnerable people the idea that they can matter. All they have to do is wander to the gun store and then wander into a school.

I unfortunately mis-remembered the difference between market and supermarket. :)  There's too much footwork to find otherwise so I dub the headline as plausible.

t1_dun7oeu	1	*	Our corrupt as fuck candidate lost the election therefore WHITE SUPREMACISTS! 
t1_dul112x	0	*	Russia provides Americans with a useful scapegoat so they can simultaneously be the greatest and worst country in the world in their own eyes.
t1_duogsqu	0	*	People *lost their shit* when a white person was going to play The Major in GitS. People from Japan were not happy about that. Does that make them far right too?
t1_duvkqld	1	*	Of course, they need their distractions for the home audience.
t1_dutbxxv	1	*	> That would mean that the situation is a lot worse right now.  As US treasuries begin to attract higher interest the level of future debt is going to increase further as Trump borrows more at higher rates
t1_duy0t86	1	*	r/conspiracy  (even this sub has been a little weird lately)
t1_dun1iy5	1	*	yes, lets make absolutely no distinction between what people say on a personal level and what they are paid to say. 
t1_dukygmd	0	*	I love it when homophobic jokes are only okay when it's a politician you don't like.   See it on facebook too. By fourteen year olds and fifty year old soccer moms. 
t1_dui3als	0	*	I think we should study this comment.   $1 Billion will be budgeted for that purpose.    Unfortunately, we will go 40% over budget, yield no clear results, and will have to allocate another $500 million to investigate why the study was so inefficient.  
t1_dupqj8n	1	*	Thank you, needed that laugh today ;)  And while I'm happy that Germany has made it to the finals, I still think it's deplorable that the NHl didn't allow players to go, particularly after the last years...
t1_duepcog	1	*	Yeah, as nice as it is to beat these people up,  people shouldn't be taking the law into their own hands       
t1_due0h4x	1	*	A private script for Ritalin is $13.39 in Australia (private as in no PBS/government funding on that price) Mind boggling how big the price differences can be.
t1_durug7p	0	*	Right?  I don't understand how hating fascist shit so much makes you emulate the people who had five times the kill count   I mean they both end in the same damn place
t1_duor8ux	1	*	Weve already been prepared for that war for decades.  Theres a difference between being prepared for war and trying to provoke one into happening.
t1_dufub9g	0	*	2017 no fatalities, 2018 2 planes crashed, 120+ dead people. I wonder how many died from car crashes this year alone.

t1_dur79c5	1	*	Hey! Socialism is actually a wide range of ideas, and doesn't encompass one government or one philosophy. Same as capitalism. Just so you know, the Venezuelan government is corrupt, and their actions don't really speak to democratic socialist or libertarian socialist movements across the world.  Thanks for posting!

t1_duwav2g	1	*	It's been an honor gaming with you 
t1_duy50y4	1	*	You are assuming that the only white farmers affected are those who inherited their farms.  There are many that would have bought their farms, potentially from a black farmer, in the past decade.  Is it fair to expropriate their land?
t1_dur2ea1	0	*	Well I know it's not a good excuse, but India has been busy dealing with its own shit. We literally have the largest poor population in the world

t1_duakokt	0	*	This is worldnews. We need to push anti Putin propaganda no matter how retarded it is. It's sad that this is coming from BBC. You would think they could find something with at least *some* substance.

t1_dur74az	1	*	Manafort owed Oleg Deripaska millions of dollars. Deripaska is very close with Putin. Im not sure if they have kompromat on Manafort, theyre just blackmailing him, mob style.

t1_dup04pv	1	*	The Russian ambassador reported the cocaine to the Argentine police and helped them catch the culprits.
t1_dux0qmu	1	*	Well, lets not try and pretend doctors are paupers or their costs are too high.  They easily pay off debt, live in beautiful homes, save, invest, travel, and retire very well. Often they dont retire because the work isnt too difficult and they enjoy it.  That said, so what? Smarter than 95% of your peers and put the work in? All to do highly lucrative work that actually helps people? Good for you. Enjoy the $300,000 to $1,200,000 per year - you earned it.
t1_duy238l	1	*	I don't think anybody is safe in Russia, well except Putin of course.
t1_dubl2ci	0	*	There is a pretty good case for Russian bots being used by the American right though. Remember all the carbon copy anti net neutrality comments made by dead people linked to Russian emails?
t1_dut57hp	1	*	Funny since Canada is paying for a bridge into Detroit because Michigan is too broke to pay their share. Maybe that's the problem, like trump casinos, you are running out of money.
t1_dumyvgd	0	*	I mean, we've all been joking that TheOnion is being upstaged by reality but this article takes the cake.  A proper journalistic piece about how professional internet trolls complain about not being fed properly...
t1_dugnte8	0	*	Careful saying these things on Reddit, remember, you're wrong and their right. You say anything against Democrats and you're immediately wrong.
t1_duf2dq7	1	*	Its the same entity
t1_dun14qu	1	*	Free World
t1_duqza7j	1	*	Your so polite. Trump supporters fall into 3 categories - are obviously either racist, are rich and looking to profit via policy, OR just have low intelligence. 
t1_duakfv0	1	*	It is satire though. The snow was going to be cleared anyways if you read the article and this was done as a joke. But BBC is trying to make it sound serious and this sub is eating it up.
t1_dur78jj	1	*	Great point
t1_duwgbw9	0	*	as you guys are so fond of reminding us, the polls had hillary as winning too.
t1_duncvg2	0	*	It's seems very few people seem to realize we switched to single use plastics (in regards to food) for sanitary reasons. I expect an upswing in hospitalized people from improperly cleaned utensils.
t1_duuhqan	1	*	It's not the first time however that Argentina has opened fire on Chinese fishing boats. I believe it sank one a couple of years ago.
t1_dulkny7	1	*	Bill Gates is your boy for that
t1_dub9zpc	0	*	Did they do that? I mean, Germans drive Leo2s not Abrams, and US tanks with crews probably wouldn't integrate that well below formation levels due to different doctrinal approaches. Genuinely curious to know what you're referring to.

t1_ductfs5	1	*	I love the thought that the most  jingoistic people I know spent the last two years sharing memes created by the enemy. I just hope a few of them one day admit it, at least to themselves.   I put enemy in quotes because Im not sure what were calling them now. If a private company in Canada sells Russians uranium, Russia is the enemy but if Russia is helping spread pro-GOP propaganda, they are allies.   Its super confusing. 
t1_durwve6	1	*	They dont have asthma. How likely is it that 70% of their best skiers have it? The only other conclusion is that Norwegians are genetically predisposed to getting asthma???
t1_duny3ky	1	*	They're not talking about inhalers, they're talking about beta-2 stimulators and clenbuterol which has been proven to be an effective fat burner which also helps to build muscle mass. It's important to realize that RT is the source here, as they have an agenda to discredit other Olympians as their country was disqualified for doping. 
t1_duxa99a	1	*	Yeah but only if you ignore the other blip on the RHS which is even higher. It is temperature variability and would not have even got a mention in the past. 
t1_duyk71s	0	*	I can't decided if this is a troll or not.  The Obama's slept in the room first, last time I checked the Ritz Carlton is a hotel. So Trump was in the same room later and had hookers pee where they slept.

t1_dutxc6x	1	*	Islamism is an ideology whereby the group (obviously Islamic) wishes to establish an Islamic state by any means necessary, up to and including violence.

t1_duqapn8	0	*	These guys are all counting on Trump to pardon them. And he'd probably do it, too. And when he abuses his presidential powers to pardon these men, his supporters will cheer and proclaim victory. We live in sad, pathetic times in our country. Truly.

t1_dudz1ed	1	*	It's fucking pathetic, isn't it? The part that gets me most is how all my friends' dicks disappeared after the election. Collusion, obstruction, corruption all staring you in the face and they're too much of pussies to even look into it with any conviction.
t1_due33iz	0	*	And this is why you are a troll.  I Googled the cost.  The highest estimates are 6.7 million over the first 5 months.  If people like you stopped lying spreading fake news maybe we could actually solve this thing.

t1_duy3r6n	0	*	 It's a populist vote-grab to stave off the culling that needs to happen to the post-Zuma parliament that is still filled with his useless cronies.   Imagine if Trump got ousted and it looked like the republicans were about to lose massively in a general election, so they decided to pass some retarded populist legislation that would rally the base.  Nothing will come of it.

It has nothing to do with capital investment and everything to do with rentseeking.

t1_dua5mv2	0	*	You can't controll entire country with drones, tanks and jets, do you really think that a drone will come at your door at 4am and kick your door, you need boots on the ground, and it is way more harder to have a police state, when citizens are armed. You really think that government will drone all cities to ashes, destroy it's infrastructure and citizens?

t1_duw37l9	1	*	A new car built by my company leaves somewhere traveling at 60 mph. The rear differential locks up. The car crashes and burns with everyone trapped inside. Now, should we initiate a recall? Take the number of vehicles in the field, A, multiply by the probable rate of failure, B, multiply by the average out-of-court settlement, C. A times B times C equals X. If X is less than the cost of a recall, we don't do one

t1_due9dmb	1	*	Is anyone advocating this?
t1_dusfvt2	1	*	Similar situations happening in Venezuela right now. Pregnant thoroughbred horses were stolen from a veterinary clinic and slaughtered for meat. Its getting really bad there.

They cant stand the fact that they won an election with help from Russia and organizations like Wikileaks who claim to be neutral.   
t1_dulcwu3	0	*	Because it takes attention away from the Jews.   We currently live with the undercurrent narrative that Jewish genocide is somehow worse than the other numerous and more deadly genocides in human history. That it's somehow more important.
t1_dupw9r6	0	*	There are many schools of economic thought. Most modern economies act (or try to act) according to Keynes, meaning that a surplus in times of boom should be a buffer, which is invested back into the economy during a following recession. There is an economic cycle that you try to tame this way.  Sadly, corruption and incompetence at policy level often leads to countries not saving a dime for tough times that are sure to come, always, as a rule, after an economic upswing. 
t1_dubnwox	1	*	Just like with regular propaganda, it wouldn't work if the audience is capable of thinking for themselves and refuses to slander entire groups of people.    But approaching anything with an open mind is starting to seem like quite a pipe dream.

t1_dueqvsb	1	*	VG is the only chance you'll ever get of going to space.  The rocket plane idea is much more efficient than a pure rocket, because:  1. initial climb to 60,000 feet is done with a plane not a rocket. 2. you don't have to carry LOX, you get it from the atmosphere 3. the equipment is reusable and in fact can be reused the same day.    VG is planning a satellite launch platform, so it's not just tourists to space
t1_duuht1q	1	*	No shit. Most of the messages in my inbox dont even negatively comment on the content of the articlejust that it is Buzzfeed and asking where the proof is. The basis of the article is from sources that confirmed the story to a Russian TV station.

My Cousin spent 6 weeks down there rebuilding their entire power grid from scratch with WPS and modernizing it all on the federal governments dime because it wasent hurricane proof. They lost every power plant with catastrophic damage.  They lost their entire power grid because they neglected it for decades while going 50 billion dollars in debt. Puerto rico is a disaster because of corruption.
t1_dufvvfl	1	*	Nah, just the shootings. 
t1_duv0m9t	1	*	Well you have to look at it on balance. More people today have the franchise than any other time in history, the world may have ups and downs but it trends towards good.

t1_duprhv0	0	*	Surprised nobody else has mentioned this.  Germany has extremely strong trade unions, and defeats the standard GOP narrative that unions are noncompetitive. 
t1_dubpo5p	1	*	Its also a good time to realise that Russia is attempting to fuel the divide between Americans. I really hope people can see this. 
t1_dukfh1q	1	*	Yeah. Its not the number of trees that are in danger with climate change. There will be a bunch of changes with biodiversity. Some animals die out, some animals thrive in response, and there will be weather changes. It has little to nothing to do with trees.  
t1_duhybhq	1	*	If there is concrete proof, people will believe.  It just has never once been proven concretely.  And apparently nobody investigating has found anything that will stick.  It also seems... surprising, that Clinton would somehow find a way to manage it better than Russia, keep it more well hidden, and target a much less influential portion of the social media population.  All in all, there's not a lot to really believe on that position.

t1_duaobe1	1	*	Anything that is susceptible to price fluctuations due to speculation is in a bubble. I can't believe how many people don't realize this simple fact.
t1_duyi4zt	0	*	I see it the same way. Mueller is just checking how far back it started.   If they had no evidence of anything shady going on in 2015-2016, why would you even bother going that far back? Despite what Trump claims, this isn't a witch hunt. If Trump laundered some money in 2013, that ain't going to do shit to him now that he's president in 2018. It wouldn't be enough for Republicans in Congress to step up.

We in part set the conditions for the trade that bring those goods to us, or for the operation of the companies that use those products in their own goods.  And yeah, it's also on the local governments too - but nobody - especially a relatively poor nation - is going to cut their wrists economically if they don't have to.

t1_dulfb98	0	*	No, moderates see this for what it is. Our democracy only works if we have an external enemy to focus on. If we don't, the anger and hatred drummed up by our extreme style of partisan politics will tear the country to shreds. Muslims in this country use every opportunity to promote a positive image, ISIS is in decline, Syria is stabilizing. We need a new enemy, Russia is our best bet thanks to decades of frosty relations.

t1_duofuud	1	*	There's enough proof. We don't need more proof, we need people to realizse how significant this is. Due to how our monkey brains work, examples are the best way to do so, not data.

t1_duf6s39	1	*	Yeah, I see and hear a lot of stuff about what the Russians did, but don't really hear that they were lying. Like all the Clinton stuff, even the fucked up stuff... all the scorn was on the fact they were hacked and were damaging, but no one seemed to want to talk about the fact they were true - and if damaging were because she was an evil she-witch.

If planting 1/532nd trees as Canada offset all the pollution of the world that'd be amazing.  But, it's just not the case.  Trees are a great carbon offset but if Trump really wanted to wreck the world there is nothing we could do to stop him.  Luckily he preaches the free market and the free market is done with coal.

t1_dug7p6b	1	*	I actually disagree with you. The reality is that in many of these 'banana republics' the companies that were controlling them had unused land that they did not want to give up. Had the land been 'privatised' and given to landless farmers with a somewhat acceptable government, one would predict a fall in the price of bananas.  That's the difference between being pro-business and pro-market.

t1_dujmkaj	1	*	The fact is, he stated during a debate with Hillary Clinton, It could be Russia, it could be China, it could be a 400 pound genius sitting in his bed.. Trump was completely open to the idea of Russia collusion and always has been. He has continually stated that the collusion just doesn't exist within his own campaign.

The concentration of caffeine is also higher. Add to that that the business model depends very high profit margins to make money for massive advertisement campaigns. Not so with coffee, since it is not a proprietary food. Starbucks etc. are not really advertising coffee, they are advertising their stores.

t1_duxkzlb	0	*	Theyre getting thrown in jail for not wearing a hat...  EDIT: Damn you, autocorrect ALSO EDIT: If this is sarcasm, sorry for misunderstanding. 
t1_dutr6jq	0	*	Except the kids who don't have a say.
t1_dunt4e8	1	*	Trump isn't calling the shots.  The US military is a rogue organization above government authority.  
t1_duabb3s	0	*	Russia wanted to put a stop to the US Regime change games they were playing in the Middle East. It was definitely going to harm Russian interests and generally is very bad for the locals. 
t1_dumjz82	0	*	I will never forget how they helped the soldiers of the U.S.S. Liberty.  I do my part every day to spread awareness of the gesture.
t1_dui9sll	1	*	The rich are replaceable. The country is full of smart, well educated people hungry for a chance to succeed and more than willing to do the same job for less. Financing is globalized, so it doesn't matter if they leave, the capital will still be available from other sources. The biggest lie the rich has made us believe is that they are indispensable. The truth is everyone is replaceable. 
t1_duje1e6	0	*	Or an enemy out there, that one works also (but requires a lot more government censorship)
t1_dur9ot7	0	*	They tortured, raped, and massacred civilians in mainland Asia, let that sink in.

t1_dup6ux4	0	*	>miracle cure on reddit  Well this one has the chance for advertisements and loot crates so maybe it will 
t1_dujj058	0	*	What bothers me even more is that they are all posted to worldnews in stead of news. I wish one could filter out Trump and not showing that news, it's annoying.
t1_dufhe3l	0	*	That's fucking heart breaking.
t1_dulwleq	0	*	Not when Reagan's private army did this to the town of El Mozote.  They even killed the infants.

t1_dutcd0i	0	*	Shut up, Bibi.
t1_dujdeuw	0	*	As a Capetonian, this is overblown rubbish. We needed to cut down our water usage, which we have done. We will not be running out of water this year and the desalination plants will be running shortly.   The current Day Zero is 9th of July, deep into our rainy season.   You can monitor what is going on here:  http://coct.co/water-dashboard/

t1_duvzpdn	1	*	God what a weirdo lol
t1_duliyhx	1	*	I'm not a fan. He was a bit anti-Semitic, he encouraged the slaughter of Vietnamese people during the war, and had a somewhat outdated view towards women. However, in the interest of fairness, he did bail out Martin Luther King Jr. from jail one time, and I'm certain there are other examples of his doing good I'm unaware of. People are complicated.
t1_dumli8n	0	*	Any context to this?
t1_dusnw3i	1	*	It's already an oxymoron, Trump turned the State Department into a shell of their former self and a good percentage of ambassador position remain unfilled, not to mention when they pick ambassadors that have insulted their host country. Like the one he picked for Netherlands.
t1_due06rx	1	*	Sick people are not in a position to say something is too expensive. That breaks the supply demand free market theory for healthcare. Combine it with patents so suppliers have a monopoly and companies can charge the maximum sum *enough* people can afford.
t1_duyr53a	1	*	Few years? lol. You make it sound like there's any chance of them blowing the lid off of this case in the next 20. 
t1_dui3r97	1	*	Must be nice. Why can't the US do that. Oh yeah, that $20 trillion in debt that we have. Moving along...
t1_dubjz7d	0	*	Hey don't blame Capitalism, the same shit sells for fair market price in every country except the one that seems to champion Capitalism the most.
t1_durkqqf	1	*	...That's... fairly much what's happened already.     They got pinned between multiple squadrons consisting of one or two of EVERY SINGLE NON-STRATEGIC COMBAT AIRFRAME IN THE USAF'S ARSENAL and a Marine artillery base to their flank.  That is a very unsavory position to be in.
t1_dugqtc8	1	*	The down votes only prove to me how authoritarian you are. Hypocrites.
t1_duqjs5m	1	*	I can't understand how a battalion sized element of Iranian and Russian troops attacking Americans is not on the frontpage of reddit. Doesn't make sense to me.

t1_dudoq4s	1	*	> Yes, have a super-science space race & cock-measuring contest  Implying that wasn't what the first one was.
t1_duw0q6s	1	*	Hard to get anything done when you're dogged by a constant sense of fear and powerlessness over the state of the climate :')
t1_duqqsgy	1	*	At least Hilary isnt president! Whew! Dodged a bullet! ^/s
t1_dudo6j2	0	*	I mean theres been multiple people of color posting that this movie is not for whites. This goes both ways my guy. 
t1_duggo4a	1	*	Still, I would be interested in viewing the effects on the outliers as well as the average effect.
t1_dub6kxt	0	*	From both sides, I should add. Or simply someone who disagrees because that's what has gotten me accused of being Russian or Trump cultist before, even though i'm neither Russian nor American
t1_duyn5ig	1	*	Trump is pro-Trump.
t1_dubo0xp	0	*	You can plant trees right now.
t1_dujf8j2	1	*	I assume if putin truly loses all support from the people, he'd be replaced by the rest of the higher ups. At the end of the day he's still at the mercy of the people around him. His power comes from their willingness to do what he says, and ends when they decide not to. 
t1_duubkz4	1	*	Oh my god can you snowflakes get over Hillary Clinton already? She lost, get over it! She has.
t1_dut35lu	1	*	If nuclear disarmament is off the table, then I guess there won't be a table in the first place.
t1_dudu2qm	1	*	I think it should be fair game to find the owners and lock them up inside chinese torture boxes.
t1_dur3s9r	1	*	When did Italy fuck with our elections?
t1_duhmfgg	1	*	You dont have to read anything that Vox wrote. Just go to the Arctic Report Card that NOAA wrote and look at the data and description they put out. You can decided for yourself (though all the facts still point out well lose Florida at this pace). 
t1_ducohio	0	*	Interesting that it says they wanted to spread damaging info on Hillary, Rubio, and Cruz. No Trump. 
t1_ducghqi	1	*	But they dont have the same impact as they did when they were posted. Timing is everything. 
t1_dumt38u	1	*	second amendment is best amendment

t1_duhyb2b	1	*	Doesnt cost $100k  We were doing well but we left remember
t1_dupxupe	0	*	Taxes are quite high actually. Mandatory healthcare and social security tax, an optional church tax, income tax and a nice 19% VAT to top it off. Also a solidarity tax meant for East Germany, union fees if you are in one (and you always should!) And a pretty high corporarion tax for the companies.   But you know...you do get lots of stuff for that in return. It's not the land of milk and honey (thats probably switzerland), but a nice place to move to if you are a low or middle income american.
t1_duq7vxk	1	*	What, you think they're planning a land invasion? lol
t1_duei2vf	1	*	their uniform is more embarrassing
t1_dumzjup	0	*	> Now we have a way to tell the Russian Trolls from the 'Muricans', as all their posts will be well written.   People with excellent language skills have the ability to communicate using common slang, short-hand, and grammar structure that doesn't stand out from their peers.  They do both, yo. Good, *and also* dumb-ish sounding and sloppy.

t1_dueb09d	1	*	I can see why you would think that. He's definitely succeeded in alienating a bunch of our allies and their foreign intelligence services, but these relationships go back half a century if not more. Plus our national interests remain allied even if our president is a buffoon, so what remains in the interest of the American people generally is also in the interest of our UK, German or Israeli allies, for example. 
t1_dun6dcb	1	*	Donald Trump Duck
t1_dub4gor	1	*	For all we know she could be plotting to overthrow the evil in her country. 
t1_duw3xeq	1	*	It's a hard truth, but too often it comes down to the color of your skin.
t1_dudul7i	1	*	Naproxen is not addictive and has no abuse potential. 
t1_dum4lc3	0	*	Developing natural life long immunity is precisely how vaccines work, with the added bonus of not being exposed to the dangerous, sometimes lethal, form of the disease. Vaccines don't introduce some new and unnatural process to your body.
t1_duf4dza	1	*	Totally agree. There was no evidence that Assad committed the first gas attack and this is just another effort to help the world see they need more freedom. In the form of a dethroned president and a new oil pipeline courtesy of uncle Sam.
t1_dujmk0l	0	*	Yet somehow, someway, its going to be framed as biased fake news meant to attack trump somehow.

t1_duq8evw	0	*	This is just party politics, republicans had Obama born in Kenya! liberals going with something something Russia!   Same shit different day.   EDIT: Okay republicans had  something something email servers! Trigger warning this thread. The noise from party politics has gotten so out of hand last decade I can't hardly pay attention, everyone a traitor etc. 
t1_duqmcix	0	*	Trump **will** pardon Manafort. Democrats and the majority of the country **will** be outraged. Republicans and MAGA trolls **will** support Trump through it. 
t1_dui4s72	0	*	> He has the cash to buy and sell much of Congress. This would be within his grasp if he wanted.  What if he feels that money is corrupting the system and eroding the public's trust, and that contributing even more corruption to the system is harmful, in principle?
t1_dusxnvz	0	*	More like trump be like damn you can do that!?  The first thing I thought when I read this was Oh, shit, China.  Second thought was Oh, shit. America.
t1_dulgyh6	1	*	Pretty much. I mean I really like the kids but fuck charles and camilla
t1_duj861d	1	*	This video looks like a parody and obviously a joke, made me lol dab
t1_dud8nqj	1	*	They were charged with bank fraud and identity theft.  They supposedly started a few rallies to support Trump.  They trolled on the internet.    I am still waiting for the number of votes they/other Russians/Trump stole from Hillary and given to Trump.  
t1_duou3od	1	*	Im really shocked that the totally non-corrupt fuckboiz in Putins inner circle ufe0f let this happen.   On second thought nah Im not. Russia showing the world how to be corrupt since forever.
t1_dusmsql	1	*	At this point I believe the only way that the worst of climate change can be avoided is through Geoengineering.   Very controversial right now, but I believe as climate change starts to bite more and more it will be seen as an appealing route. 
t1_duq1aji	1	*	What exactly in post-colonial African history lead you to believe that?
t1_duw073e	0	*	The Arctic is in the northern hemisphere
t1_duc67cw	1	*	Israel has been doing the same thing since its founding, so we can use that to figure out what the likely pitfalls would be. The big one would be going cheap and planting a bunch of clones, as that lead to a bit of a monoculture.
t1_durxago	0	*	I live in Toronto and it's been raining the last two weeks. At this point in the year we as Canadians should be huddled around coffees bitching about the only thing who's feelings we can't hurt - the weather.
t1_dupullk	1	*	Free transportation ideally 
t1_dur7aqi	1	*	I would like us to get a vault that is very highly fortified against radiation at a Lagrange point in Earth's shadow. Either that or one in a deep, deep hole on the moon. All of that in addition to what's in use and the terrestrial vault.  You don't have a complete backup until you have it in three places minimum. One of which is offsite. 
t1_dudw7e6	1	*	Of course we do- my family as well. Google purepecha and you will find there are still active communities on the west coast. 
t1_dui1oru	0	*	Well and keep in mind that you are still doing very well in comparison to, lets say, Eastern European countries. You can't even imagine the real definition of the word shithole. I can compare those two and trust me, even if you don't think so, you are fine. :-)

t1_duhu1gx	1	*	Citizens yes, but the Chinese gov't has started to feel the backlash and has begun cracking down on their homegrown asshole tourists. Similarly, it is illegal to steal from a museum in the US, but this US citizen was still an ass and did it anyways.  http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2015-01/16/content_19338636.htm

t1_dubghti	0	*	Where have you been bro
t1_duw6i4t	1	*	To be fair, the scientific community and popular media kind of fucked up by hammering in to peoples heads that climate change = global warming. Not everyone has the privilege of understanding why climate change makes a polar vortex act up, theyve heard all their lives that everything is just going to get warmer, and now apparently it isnt true anymore
t1_duj8cr4	1	*	That's exactly what they talk about in the video

t1_dugnjnp	1	*	Yeah, he's either got a bad memory or is just straight up lying. The top comment in this post proves that. 
t1_dul10zy	1	*	No, because it will take years for them to investigate Netanyahu on this *brand new* accusation, and years until they might decide to take it to court, if ever.  Also, in this case it is probable that Netanyahu didn't even know what his associate did.
t1_dued737	1	*	Maybe because cow milk is a better product. And it is cheaper.  That could be why.   Did you really need someone to point that out?

t1_dub8uzz	0	*	The left can't grasp the concept that not everyone agrees with them.  Disagree == russian bot.  Then when the election happened, they blamed it on russians rigging the election.  The russians hacked the DNC.  (This one is probably true, but so did like 20 other orgs, and wikileaks didn't use russia as the source)  And of course Trump is a russian spy.  It's insanity, but the MSM is pushing it, so people who lack critical thinking somehow are acting like it's the Red Scare all over again.

My skin is white but that's irrelevant, my culture isn't 'white', it's Scottish, and it's different from the English, the Irish, the French, the German, the Swedish, Finnish, Danish, Czech, whatever the fuck. 'White' doesn't exist.

t1_dujcfi8	1	*	One crazy boi, ah ah ah.  Two crazy bois, ah ah ah.
t1_dunm65q	0	*	Prolly because USA is still consider the biggest country in term of influence. So if US politic has a chance to influence your own people, you'll try to do what you can to limit the potentialy bad influence it can have.  And on a more personnal note, USA has tried to influence the world politic for decades (cold war was about politic influence) so why the opposite shouldn't happen ?
t1_dula0hd	1	*	Well its either his or H.C fault, right ? 
t1_dutph48	1	*	It's really up to you, and really depends on the year.  This year's vaccine [was awful and had a varrying effectiveness rate from 36% to 17%](https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/2/1/16960758/flu-vaccine-effectiveness).  If you are prone to secondary sickness (ie the very young and old) you should probably get it since just getting it can be deadly.  But for everyone else it can range from very effective to basically useless.

Mr. Oliver, on the other hand, is running for the Office of a *foreign country's* head of state. The differences are subtle. Also, to my knowledge, his campaign is not sponsored by Doritos.

t1_duaxenr	1	*	Turkey has one of the strongest military forces in the world. You can't just waltz in like we did in middle eastern nations.  We've gotten so used to asymmetrical wars, we don't even know what true war looks like anymore it seems.

t1_dui82z2	0	*	The argument is that more of the taxes paid goes towards them (policing rich communities, state dept. and military defending overseas investments, etc.)  It might be a net gain if they left, as they aren't paying that much in taxes anyway.  EDIT:  Also, if we're talking about income tax (including cap gains) then it is tax on income earned in the US regardless of where they reside.

t1_dugz3cz	1	*	Cleaning under the foreskin is about as simple and takes about as long as calmly opening, stepping through and closing an unlocked door. The arguments about circumcision being hygienic make it seem like that is the level of task that is beyond your ability.  That doesn't make me think you have a point, it makes me think you need a caretaker.
t1_dudeb3q	1	*	These guys played both sides of the fence to stir shit up, none of it points to trump being involved. 
t1_duy9r8e	0	*	How much of that was with American influence because the political landscape of Korea at the time was uneven at best? Im not blaming American influence directly, but I will say that I do believe America was like hey buddy why dont you just sign that document so we can go back to protecting you like we protect japan and end hostilities between two allies? Technically, Japan is closer to American territories than Korea, thus during the Cold War has a larger significance to America.
t1_dum5ea6	0	*	Lol, let them go I say. 
t1_dujwsu2	1	*	2. Blame capitalism
t1_duuk0w8	1	*	The food wars are coming, so their ways will definitely change soon.
t1_duw5s79	1	*	Currently in a mass extinction 
t1_dusirdb	1	*	Thats because the Arctic has been seeing record warm weather. Instead of the Arctic air sitting over the Arctic it has split into two masses that are hanging out over the continents (NA / Russia & EU). So its really cold for us, but over the north pole they have positive C temperatures right now. 
t1_dubmgff	1	*	> What if they're just trying to rally support for whatever policy will weaken our nation and divide us?  Well yeah, that's probably their intent now that HOLY SHIT IT WORKED IT FUCKING WORKED.  Originally it was likely just an attempt to fuck up Hilary Clinton's day, because Putin hated her.  
t1_dus616l	1	*	Who ironically got a Nobel Peace prize.  It was then, I'm sure, that the prize lost all of its legitimacy
t1_dutgaxt	1	*	If by 'achieved more' you mean back to square one, then yes. It seems that the bar has been lowered for what we now consider as achievement.

t1_duyin8r	1	*	Lul, people from T_D see the name Mueller and instantly get a hard on, trying to bounce on Trump's dick too hard. Your comment is pretty mild too and these people are still bitching/trolling.
t1_duh22z7	1	*	Probably not
t1_duqyeo7	0	*	Well, technically conspiracy against the United States. But still not good. 
t1_dukqi6v	1	*	They aren't doing it because of Obama.
t1_dumxqvy	0	*	I'm as anti-Trump as anyone else... but let's not forget that Russia's plan is to stoke both sides of the political divide. They have Russian bots pretending to be Americans who are anti-Trump as well.   Russia is the kid on the playground yelling Fight! Fight! Fight!   So we should be cautious of everyone who is an extreme. 
t1_duq3sqh	1	*	German here. I have a 38.5 hour week, 36 days of holiday.   Life's alright. I don't make six figures (which should be mandatory according to reddit) and I don't have to worry about going bankrupt if I get sick. All covered for. 
t1_duproiz	1	*	If this guy was in the US, there would be 15 people dead in a mosque.
t1_dutjoux	1	*	Up for sure. 
t1_ducwksd	1	*	Because the Republicans control Congress, and theyd rather have Trump than a Democrat.
t1_dugm7dg	1	*	Nobody is saying they prefer you one way or the other, are they? We're talking about Iceland's decision to end the barbaric shit. Nobody cares if you like to be that way. An adult can be circumcised if he wants to be.
t1_duihtq6	1	*	Isn't this different? The US government went into debt for this, its not like we have more money than we know what to do with, so we will give it to the people. Its more like, we need the economy to stay afloat so we will give people money to spend so that more people aren't laid off.  
t1_durc5og	1	*	actually there's some evidence to suggest it was Russia's invasion of Manchuria that prompted unconditional surrender, although a fair amount of documentary evidence was destroyed so we may never know for sure 
t1_duuxi3d	0	*	To be perfectly fair, this is what a real measure to prevent drug abuse looks like, you either decriminalize or you go to actual war against drugs, you can't have an in-between or else you're just giving room for people to find ways around your crap
t1_dulmwof	0	*	Their new president is already saying hes going to seize land from white people without compensation so...
t1_duyc41i	1	*	Less CO2, but more NOx. Co2 is just a greenhouse gas, NOx is bad for human health. 
t1_duk4iri	0	*	Sure, but isn't the problem with climate change more that a very delicate balance is being disturbed than that a massive change is happening?
t1_dusnm0g	1	*	Many feel the same way. Japanese acts over the last 100 years has set a new low for humanity. There would be more sympathy towards them if they admitted their guilty, educated their population on the horrors they committed and tried to make up to the victims involved. To be totally honest, after all the crimes they committed during that period it would not be worth a single more life to be lost on the opposite side to Japan. The atomic bombs absolutely saved lives of allied forces.

t1_dui5z8d	1	*	U0001f43c
t1_dur27o7	1	*	Why can we not be happy that people are being helped? Why is it our people and their people. Nigerians are our people and helping them or anyone else is making the world better for humanity. If you think nobody is helping anyone in the United States, pay more attention. 
t1_dujbnrl	1	*	People are always so concerned for their religion but in truth religion has adapted plenty to these things. Just make it a symbolic ritual where the child isn't actually harmed.
t1_duse4qp	1	*	Instead of donating to the red cross, cut out the middle man and hit up the brothels yourself

Socialised medicine is one of the greatest things about my country and even though the NHS is chronically underfunded I wouldn't trade it for the US system.
t1_dupptad	1	*	> Lets hope those farmers that voted for trumpo lose their liveleyhoods.  Ok easier there Hitler. That's a little extreme isn't it? Everyone gets to vote every 4 years, you shouldn't lose your livelihood over it.

t1_dumb0gg	1	*	> Russia's like ...we got you by the balls...  So what you're saying is that Putin & Russia are homosexual?
t1_duz6dja	0	*	> and the existence and actions of the infamous Unit 731.  A more common counter to Unit 731 is/was that the US gave immunity to a bunch of the commanders, soldiers, doctors in return to only give the US the data on biological weapons testing.   So a majority of people can just say, well Unit 731 was given immunity its over, and that proof of the experiments they did disappeared.
t1_ducxfyr	1	*	What about insisting that people verify their identity on Twitter?
t1_durufhr	1	*	Unless Red Cross gives them for free then these paid prostitutions are really anomalous.
t1_duvxbzb	1	*	Because earnings for shareholders rise too
t1_duw1a5a	0	*	Not wanting to pay extra and trying to destroy your partner company is a completely different thing. Don't try to justify this as a normal business practice. 
t1_dum048x	1	*	Pinoy here, sadly many seem to support him as they are tricking into believing his war on drugs is working. I'm actually the child of some immigrants from the Philippines to the US

t1_dur8y26	0	*	Well thankfully, most of us will die before shit really hits the fan around 2100.  edit: this was meant as a rather bitter post. I did not mean for it to be taken as haha who cares, I will die anyway

t1_dugtwo8	1	*	They quit being official statements when he started tweeting 20 times a day
t1_dup8u37	0	*	Honest question here. Why is anti-semitic even a term when 'racist' and 'bigoted' can be easily used in it's place? Is being a racist or a bigot different than being anti-semitic?
t1_duwnhk4	0	*	Yeah we are really short on doctors right now. I want to go to med school after my nursing program, so I asked my family physician about med schools and he told me honestly right now I would be better off becoming an NP because places are trying to cut down on the cost of doctors and replacing them with NPs. He isn't the only physician I have heard saying this either. 
t1_duvhn1x	1	*	You mean congress?
t1_duefvwx	1	*	There's only so much compost you need for a tiny country. Not to mention that the Dutch are importing a large part of the livestock feed and what goes in, well...
t1_dubxwsq	1	*	As with all great things, each must fall and pass into memory. I remember banana popsicles. Where did they go?
t1_duqn2iw	0	*	Treason is aiding and comforting the enemy, and has only ever been applied with respect to an active armed conflict/rebellion, excepting once related to a massive labor dispute - I think he was later pardoned, too.  Conspiracy against the United States is a catchall that can come in for conspiring to bypass various laws.  So, a complicated system of taxfraud, moneylaundering, failing to register as a foreign agent, misleading others into the same.  
t1_dud2j3m	1	*	That is what terrorists used to think as well. If the govt wants them bad enough they will eventually get them.
t1_dujevzp	1	*	fucking ... well...

Found out how incredibly hard it is to find a way to dispose of your trash when trucks don't come and pick it up two times every week? I think it would be a much more likely explanation that trash isn't sufficiently managed on the level of infrastructure, making trash disposal very difficult if not outright impossible for the locals.

ETA: does Left Hand Enterprises fit into this in any way? 
t1_due9a99	0	*	Yes, the IMF knows it will attract more business to the US.  Then some other country will make themselves even more attractive and businesses will move there.  Eventually first world countries battling for these megacorporations' tax revenues will find themselves without the money they need for basic services.  Governments pandering to businesses is how democracy breaks.

t1_dugzixf	0	*	If it weren't rush hour, I'd agree with you. I go to a local place, and they usually have three people behind the counter. However, they handle orders individually. When things get busy, they do end up making a line of drinks, and doing separate parts of each drink together, like an assembly line. Whatever it takes to create great product at good quality, and in a short amount of time. 
t1_duj457q	0	*	I have a feeling that $5.8m won't last very long. Not the best comparison, but where I live it costs almost that much to plow the streets after a major snow storm... I can't even imagine the logistics of delivering water to millions of people every day. :-|

In 2008 it was ~120% of GDP up from 107% in 2005 and 99% in 1995. At the point they joined the Euro in 2002 they were at an eye watering 104% of GDP.   Unemployment is still high, younger generation escaping to the rest of Europe, lack of economic reforms, but the strength of the Euro is actually helping them a little.

t1_dun5z94	1	*	Putin is not a pussy. He is smart, greedy, and ruthless. If legitimate and critical debate were permitted and a fair candidate was allowed to freely run for president, there is a very real possibility that he would lose the election and that is simply a fact. It is a fact for weak politicians and tough ones alike. By not allowing a challenger, he circumvents this risk to his power. It has nothing to do with toughness and everything to do with minimizing risk.

t1_duajaw9	1	*	Or you were subject to a biased source.   Putin isn't universally loved, and many of those that support him do so only because there are no good alternatives. Navalny on the other hand, even though his name is very much recognized, is virtually unknown to the people in regards of his policies or who he is at all. Thee's plenty of people in the country who dislike Putin or write   on the walls, but that means nothing in politics.

t1_dux6gpa	0	*	> but it feels good right?  No. It feels stupid.  How in the world is this going to remedy the situation in any way whatsoever?  I suppose it can bring a little more attention to the issue guns being too available, but I think everyone already knows it's an issue. 
t1_duwaaa9	0	*	Well if you actually read the article youd know its more likely down to the #metoo movement than migrants but you probably didnt lol

t1_duoqcr5	1	*	> In Chinese media he is portrayed as a man doing the necessary evil for his country, promoting cooperation and rejecting western imperialism.   He did nothing while China built out their military installations in the Philippine's Exclusive Economic Zone. I think that says more than enough about who's side he's on and who likely put him there. If you can't circumvent a UN Resolution, circumvent the country's system who submitted it. 
t1_duy3rgp	1	*	Racism is just a justification for stupidity. Which uses the former to gain popularity and to win. However, with a lack of educated and qualified personnel, we sure know how this all is going to end.
t1_dulunmw	1	*	I'm assuming you're saying that have to is incorrect because you're using the ownership definition of the word. Word have multiple meanings. If you see books, TV shows, movies, and news articles all doing something, it's highly unlikely that it's not correct. And by highly unlikely, I don't mean the word unlikely high up in a plane

t1_durch0n	1	*	> will Japan accept the atrocities they committed to the Chinese before parading its own victims?  Will the US accept the war crimes committed in Vietnam? Will the names of war criminals be removed from the Vietnam memorial? I don't think so. Even the people that committed the My Lai massacre never went to prison that was literally on the same level as ISIS.
t1_dujoie3	1	*	He is on record as saying I don't believe Russia meddled in the election.  That might be semantically different from saying I **know** Russia **did not** meddle in the election, but the intent is the same.

t1_duyb42o	1	*	Indeed

t1_duvexxv	1	*	No he's not. It was just a joke about how he could *technically* be elected under specific circumstances.  This is just a dumb clickbait title.
t1_dumwtyk	1	*	That sounds really stupid. In Van Buren's defense, however, he didn't grow up speaking English.  Edit: As his name would suggest, he grew up speaking Dutch. Look it up.

t1_duv3svu	1	*	The Chinese government censors things that could lead to collective action, whether or not that thing would be good for the party. Somewhat ironically they don't censor criticsm unless it's criticism about censorship.
t1_duvu6v6	1	*	The irony of throwing a political opposition supporter in jail because they suggest the government might be corrupt. It's getting silly now.

t1_dur4uki	0	*	I've been to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum; they accept the atrocities committed by Imperial Japan in Nanjing, and even provide a description of what happened - I didn't see anything else like this anywhere else in the country.  On that basis, I'd say that the proposal is at least somewhat understandable.  I've also been to the Nanjing Massacre Memorial Hall, which has... quite a different tone.

t1_duqokgj	0	*	I thought that was just an internet joke.   Do you actually believe this is true?  The only possible way you could think this is if you neither understand socialism nor Venezuela and youre just regurgitating something you read online.
t1_duc7bvs	1	*	You know these oligarchs stripped the Russian people and fleeced us too with the help of Soros?
t1_duxsm8e	1	*	Yeah. No. After stalin died and was denounced  the left was in disarray largely abandoned communism. Most of Those that stayed engaged shifted over to trotskyism or just towed whatever the ussrs  current line was.

t1_dupko9e	1	*	This reminds me of the World before the First World War. Germany was an industrial and economic powerhouse and if Kaiser Wilhelm had done nothing instead of going to war, [Germany would have become the European, if not the World economic leader.](http://countrystudies.us/germany/30.htm) Sorry if this is not a great source but I did hear this in a documentary about the 1900s which I can't find right now.

t1_dujdw9n	0	*	Well the refugee segment of anti-vaxers do have a justifiable reason: the cia sorta ran a fake vaccination program over in the Middle East awhile back. So I'd give the benefit to anyone who was within 2 degrees of separation of that particular incident.

t1_dui9mka	0	*	How is this a ban at all? Russian athletes still play, are/were scheduled to carry the Russian flag, have Russia media fawning over them and you know Russia will add their medals to the official total anyway and let everyone know about it.       Am I missing something?

He's not washing decks, he's not cooking, or piloting the boat. Other people do that, but the decisions that safeguard people, are his and his alone, and this guy is like: what do you want me to do about it...
t1_duymnc1	1	*	Worse. They might find themselves in a crisis of succession that could tear the country apart. It's highly ironic given their party's obsessive focus on national unity.
t1_dullxor	1	*	My guess is that moderate means what the average person can drink every day without intoxication but also that you're spacing it out evenly. If you're having 14-21 in one sitting per week most MDs would probably still consider you to be a heavy drinker.
t1_duaimhl	0	*	I wonder if it could be applied really fast.  Maybe someone could design spraypaint can nozzles that spray in the shape of Navalny so it's just a quick spray-and-run.
t1_duvb2yv	1	*	Exactly. It seems to be the mental attitude of many countries in South East Asia. I live in Thailand, in a fish farming region with no tourism. You'd think people would keep their fish ponds and surrounding area clean from plastic. I see people throwing plastic all the time. The banks of most ponds always seem to have plastic around.

t1_dubtd74	0	*	It's funny because everyone's so dependent on China now that sanctions will be shooting themselves in the foot - and probably only increase China's influence via the rest of the world. 
t1_dus4kt6	1	*	addressing human rights doesn't mean military intervention. Human rights problems can be addressed by diplomacy, sanctions, trade incentives, humanitarian aid and other means.  agreed military intervention is rarely justified or effective.  but that doesn't mean we should ignore human rights abuses and the governments who perpetrate them.
t1_duuboy2	1	*	Its a slow news day. There is literally a local news story about a gas explosion up right now too
t1_dute7i4	0	*	Yes. Let's remove the separation of church and state. By taxing churches you are giving them the right to have a say in what the money is used for.

t1_dulr76u	1	*	Yah Ive been downvoted for pointing that out.  The FBI report is pretty clear of what the objective is but the hate for Trump is so strong that they just ignore that part and just focus on the part where the trolls were pro trump.  My understanding is the trolls are pretty focused on the anti Trump part now.
t1_duv3iwe	1	*	I know a lot of Filipino people and I can explain why Duterte's supporters are fine with all the killing.    Almost all of the Filipinos I know (and are no longer friends with, for what you're about to read) are extremely religious.

t1_dud0pnq	1	*	Defendants made various expenditures to carry out those activities, including buying political advertisements on social media in the names of U.S. persons and entities. Defendants also staged political rallies inside the United States, and while posing as U.S. grassroots entities and U.S. persons, and without revealing their Russian identities and ORGANIZATION affiliation, solicited and compensated real U.S. persons to promote or disparage candidates. 
t1_duaa5s0	1	*	Doesn't mean it's not true. Our trading opportunities will be, with the current lack of any trade deals, significantly weaker than being a part of the EU.  Doesn't mean that Japan wouldn't do the same, however

Multiple indictments, multiple confessions and plea deals, multiple emails and verified reports of corrupt dealings and attempts at collusion with a foreign adversary, all with that blathering fool acting guiltier than sin and screeching witch hunt on twitter every chance he gets. If that's a waste of tax payer dollars to trump supporters, then they really are a bunch of imbecilic traitors. 
t1_duxquzo	1	*	I guess what you're lookin for is the free the nipples movement that protests that female nipples are considered sexual and nudity whereas male nipples are somehow fine. Women have been arrested in Western countries for going topless in protest in places where men are allowed to be topless. Same concept, different  bodypart and violence of enforcement.

t1_dustyif	1	*	Well said. Comparing it to the Hoover dam is spot on. I dont think many people understand the long term downside to this. Many just believe the US will get paid back. But they dont understand the economics.   Most illegals arent even coming over the south border anymore.  They fly in and overstay their visa.  Its easier to come over on a student visa for a few months, than trek across a desert or hitchhike with a coyote.   There are so many other areas that $18 billion could do some real good.

t1_duufbzt	1	*	I'll add that if there's anything we should learn here, it is that people should be more critical of what they read, and while we're at it, actually read articles before starting to form a strong opinion. That alone would (almost) solve the Troll Factory propaganda problem.
t1_duaazmh	1	*	Lmao.
t1_dussany	0	*	Actually, you have just inspired me to do some research into this era in 1918 - 1953 you talk about: why did these dictatorships flourish? What were the economic, political, and social environments which allowed them to persist?  Thank you!

t1_dupzf9g	1	*	> Funny how this story made it to the front page of major news outlets such as The Guardian an even CNN.   Because it furthers their agenda. Just like the female viking warrrior story.   It's almost like the guardian, cnn, wapo, nytimes and all the media are run by people with an agenda rather than objective robots.

t1_duy0ip9	1	*	Jinping turned a terrible oppressive government into one that is actually livable.  Life expectancy and standards of living jump nearly unimaginably in the last 30 years.

Knowing everything you know now, could you be convinced that what he is saying is truth? The same goes for them.  Sadly, humans don't have a sense that tells them what truth is truthful, except logic. And there are many steps taken to nullify their use of it.
t1_duzfi95	0	*	What does that mean?
t1_duvdeis	0	*	What is strange about it?  People are desperate to get to Europe.  What the hell are you going to do in the middle of the Mediterranean if all of a sudden the guy tells you the price has doubled?  There's all kinds of horrible things happening on these back roads into Europe.  Extortion, slavery, and murder are unfortunately part of the risks people are willing to take to get to the west.

t1_duh3b6w	1	*	*three months later*  Guys, Trump has only been indicted because he mentioned Podesta's emails in a speech once. Trump leads to podesta who leads to the other podesta who leads back to the other podesta who leads to clinton. What a bunch of leftards!
t1_duw5mqn	1	*	Yeah like Trump is big on specifics.
t1_dupzbn6	1	*	Because it's global news when one nation engages/or is accused of engaging in information warfare with another, and especially relevant when a country involved is an ally.
t1_dukt1t4	0	*	That is really odd, because lookups are usually cached. That means that someone was doing something odd *and* they misconfigured that something.

t1_dumqkvb	1	*	Using those doesn't mean you're racist read the article, rather racists are using these to try and legitimize them sleeves as when people see klan robes they automatically turn off to what you're saying, if racists look normal however then it's another story

t1_duc2jtb	1	*	Theres also the common practice of inducing births on weekdays so the doctor can have the weekend off. Birth has its own schedule, doctors should not be inducing you early for their own convenience.   C-sections are a surgery and the situation is easily controlled. Vaginal births have their own timeline and doctors have very little control over the process, making them a higher risk factor for the hospital because there's more potential for things to go wrong.

t1_duxvqgo	0	*	Why would our God let this happen?!  Fucking hair!  Ahhh, I can't take it!!!  Seriously though, religious police need to fucking go... isn't it 2018 or did I end up back in 25 C.E.?
t1_duhvd8b	1	*	The SG government runs like a corporation, and has plenty of capital. This is essentially a dividend on Singapore Inc.
t1_duux3u0	1	*	and its 10 deg warmer here in toronto 
t1_duj0nsa	1	*	I know someone there and it's kinda fucking terrifying.   The best thing they can do is get the fuck out.. or risk being harmed, which just means there are fewer of them to defend rights and it's easier to bully and hurt them. It's fucked up.
t1_duf2nyn	1	*	Only two were, and back in 2014. Travel visas aren't immunity to commit a crime cards. If they pose no open or immediate risk to national security you're most likely to approve their visa. Issue was that what they were doing was in-fucking-cognito, so not exactly easy to see from the State Departments standpoint.
t1_duphsf4	1	*	They will get you drunk.... off the hump.
t1_dux18dg	1	*	the problem is that for most small businesses, their value is in their human relationships.
t1_duuel10	0	*	Nah yeah nah. People who love the ocean hate on what the Chinese have done to our oceans. They're responsible for most of the illegal fishing that occurs across the globe and give absolutely no fucks about the ocean
t1_dun0yk9	1	*	The kid in the video had a clearly American/Russian accent. Sounded really odd to me. 
t1_duudccl	1	*	How are the two in anyway related? Tf

t1_dubvrw6	0	*	Lol, kittens
t1_dut0gca	1	*	Trump is not anywhere close in the galaxy to a dictator although he may want to be .. our govt is designed to offset limit check and balance people who want to be another Dear Leader
t1_dur8r7e	1	*	Or perhaps poisoned. Russia is a dictatorship kleptocracy.

t1_dubitwi	1	*	But hey, at least the plumber's on time
t1_durybq9	1	*	What has that got to do with telling the story of the effect of dropping nuclear bombs on cities? Innocent people died because of the actions of brutal uncaring politicians. The lesson they have learned is to NOT blindly support corrupt and venal politicians.   You on the other hand simply find excuses.  You have an idiot predisnet who is actually contemplating doing the same thing.
t1_duia2d2	0	*	I've read Rich Dad Poor Dad, and it's a great book with ideas that should help many people. However, the way of the world is much more complicated, especially when you throw healthcare into the mix. How many people are tens of thousands in debt because they made a visit to the hospital?
t1_duq5u63	0	*	That was not even Russia's intent.  They just want the West in such chaos, partisan dead lock, and fake news that we're unable to coalesce to effectively counter Russia's global hegemony ambitions.
t1_dudqp4m	0	*	USA tells Facebook to take down stuff related to elections, they do. Russia tells Facebook to take down stuff related to elections, they act same as with USA request, take it down. Pot and kettle say hello to each other.  Be very very careful about setting precedence of taking down stuff in internet for political reasons (or any other reason). If it is good for USA to do, other nations will demand same rights.
t1_duy4jv2	1	*	/r/canada has no effect on general population, just like bernie sanders subreddit

t1_dulz8mk	1	*	/r/theydidthemath 
t1_durumli	0	*	i was just thinking this.   Russia and China can single handily coordinate together and turn the world economy into a shit show if they dump all their U.S. bonds and stop buying the dollar.  and its absolutely possible, especially now with a potential trade war looming between the U.S. and other countries. Plus 20+ trillion in debt and central banks creating the everything bubble with quantitative easing for the past 10 years

t1_duys0v2	0	*	If Obama went to Haiti and fucked underage boys would that be reason to throw him out? Now substitute Obama with Trump and boys with girls. Is that a reason to throw out Trump?  I obviously have no idea what happened bc I work for a living. I'd have to rely on those who investigate these things to find out.

t1_duhv7w4	1	*	denying the holocaust is a criminal offence in Germany.
t1_dupget7	1	*	The headline is a deliberate misreading of Trump's actual statement, which is stated in the article, and is that video games and movies may [shape] young people's thoughts. This is not a statement of causality of violence.  
t1_duhhabu	1	*	It's nice to see that the old methods still have a place in the modern world. Perhaps the pirates can bring along a seige tower with them, next time.
t1_duwbu3j	1	*	Yeah, just detain an ill person and take away their medication. Oops!
t1_ducuca7	1	*	>Edit: Why on earth would this post be controversial?  Because its been widely reported who the military contractor was (PMC Wagner). Most likely this was sloppy intelligence and this group didnt know who they were really attacking. That or Russia was more involved then they say and they wanted to see what level of readiness that the US bases were at. The injured mercs were sent back to be treated in Russia
t1_dudm7nq	1	*	99% of the things they did aren't illegal and our own MSM has done worse.

t1_dut3y0z	1	*	Actually most seem to be laughing at a moronic predisent who had a temper tantrum. BTW that predisent is running a country renown for slaughtering innocents in the name of freedom. It has the bigger cartel.
t1_duqoq7e	1	*	They probably asked him questions about things they already knew and he lied. 
t1_duh07k6	0	*	This just evens out the positive propaganda from the gun lobby.  No doubt they have a bunch of re-worked statistics about how guns make people safer etc.

t1_duxs9k8	1	*	> It's easy to make fun of and denounce their ass-backwards ways  It's the government, not the people, don't forget. There are plenty of totally regular people from Iran. They don't like it either.

t1_duvybvu	0	*	GOD WILLS IT
t1_dueje2y	0	*	Doesn't matter, haters gonna hate.  I am currently trying to work out if its safe to come out of my nuclear bomb proof bunker. I took the Government at its word when they said the moment we voted for Brexit everything would fall apart. Emergency tax rises, massive unemloyement.  Within a year it would be pretty much like living like people did in Mad Max.  One day I may venture out to see the devastation and help the few people alive to remember the old times. 
t1_dumg0qe	1	*	That's exactly what they did back then as well.
t1_dudtyqk	1	*	They will again as biosimilars for this drug are now very attractive to other pharma companies.

t1_dutbnuv	1	*	Had no regard, not no regards. Check out the difference. 
t1_dubm8am	1	*	They already are. The US hasn't left Syria yet, and I believe the military is sitting on Syrian oil fields. It might not be politically viable to stay though, especially now that the govt. can't really use ISIS as an excuse.
t1_dufack9	1	*	this.
t1_dut89yn	1	*	Shallow, large magnitude, in the mountains. Papua New Guinea is no stranger to earthquakes but I hope everyone is safe.  The depth may change because 10km is the fixed value for the USGS catalog when they can't determine a depth. Usually modeling an earthquake depth is only difficult when the earthquake is pretty shallow (0~20km) so 10km isn't a bad approximation. **Ninja edit: Depth is now 35km and magnitude M7.5.**
t1_dulo8cl	1	*	China is just so far ahead of us in innovation these days that I don't think the USA and EU can ever recover. 
t1_duac4gr	0	*	ah, so just wipe them from the internet, right? No problem there, pretty easy to do 
t1_dums4zm	1	*	I mean, that the indictments happened sure. There's probably some legal case on at least one of them saying they shouldn't have been indicted. That's not a bad thing on Mueller, just what happens when you target so many people.
t1_duuuyru	0	*	I had an ex with this mentality.  I was recovering from an opiate addiction and was she was pretty relentless in terms of my being an addict. She wouldn't let me live it down even though I wasn't actively using.  Meanwhile, she was blowing 60mgs of oxycontin a day, but it was ok because she was prescribed them.
t1_dubhngm	0	*	This comment reeks of ignorance.
t1_dum9v5m	1	*	Pretty common in most European countries these days for a variety of misdemeanours.    Some guy in Finland got a 50,000 speeding fine a few years back.  And I don't even think that it was a European record.

t1_dudv2gg	1	*	Well you're right actually they never expected a patient to pay that price they just do it to get more money from health insurances.
t1_dufu09u	0	*	They feel so much better after your comment.
t1_dud37b5	1	*	That's an interesting reduction of what they did.
t1_duutwqf	1	*	No. I live in the Philippines and I fucking hate Duterte and his mindless fanatics. Killing people, criminals or not, is wrong. I personally know someone whose father got  killed based off of suspicions alone. It's really disheartening with what's happening in the country right now. 
t1_duwlztv	0	*	Add to that one of the lowest cost of living of the country/continent and the fact it happens barely 2 weeks after a huge outcry from exhausted nurses who fear for their patients' safety and their own work conditions when they are chronically understaffed and mandatory overtime has become the norm.
t1_duh67hy	0	*	Is abortion legal and do they have the services to administe them in rural areas?

t1_duvvlmb	1	*	http://www.foxnews.com/world/2010/07/18/socialism-private-sector-dominates-venezuelan-economy-despite-chavez-crusade.html  Fox News pointed out in 2010 that Venezuela is not actually socialist.
t1_duncrnb	1	*	Does that include slavery or maybe female genital mutilation? How about indentured servitude? The right to vote?  Some cultures are shit.

t1_dujyosm	0	*	Many athletes from all over the world use PEDs. The problem isn't isolated only to Russia.
t1_dunkeuh	0	*	The quotas that the EU have set are in the first place unsustainable (in fact they're three times the size of what would be the maximum sustainable yield)... and the estimated, realized catch is again twice the EU-set quotas. Which becomes 1/3rd of the estimated total Blue Fin Tuna population. I'd be surprised if they _don't_ go extinct.

t1_duyenjx	0	*	Like 60 year old men dictating womens health and reproductive policy???
t1_duplhd6	1	*	Turns out 1 million people needing to buy refrigerators actually stimulates the economy. Sure, the federal budget gave them 20 billion first, but still a nice economic spending program.
t1_duby2m9	1	*	If hes deluded himself to believing he really is a time traveler, then yeah hell pass it.   Im sure anyone whos got mental issues that believes something - that just isnt true - to be quite true, theyll pass the test.   
t1_dujklxb	1	*	Many, but not most.
t1_duc8cn8	1	*	no that is not correct - they are in a poor village and the poorer villages were getting access to the vaccines last.  So you are correct that they are free to normal citizens, he just hurried the process for his village.
t1_duqjeug	0	*	If that were remotely true, Pakistan would still get a passing mention. So far there is no indication that this is true.  If it does turn out to be true, than I'm fully ready to admit I was wrong, but so far it seems that there is no indication that Pakistan was put on any list.  Why would KSA, where Pakistan just sent troops, and Chinan who're spending tens of billions in Pakistan,  do something that is clearly against their own interests?
t1_dunlquc	1	*	Especially when 3/4 of the worlds fisheries are either exploited or already depleted 
t1_duqurx1	1	*	In what strange fucked up utopian world do you think there are do-overs in presidential elections? 
t1_duwlg86	0	*	Out of 20 000. Its essentially a PR move, doctors are hated in Quebec right now, because of the 2 doctors leading our government. 
t1_dugeeek	1	*	Sure, as long as you pay for it, it's completely free. 
t1_dulguj5	1	*	Sounds a lot like we have here in Lithuania. You can chose religion classes or ethics classes. In both of them you study the human morality, just in the religion one it is viewed from the religious side of things
t1_dukh5r2	1	*	Hi, it's me, your alt's Russian cancer
t1_duj8bld	1	*	Because they:  1. Think their values are universal and so want them exported for the good of those foreign people.  2. Want to expand their sphere of influence. The America/Israel/Saudi block is politically opposed to the Iran/Iraq/Syria/Russia block.
t1_dug8ryh	1	*	He tried to hurry too hard.

t1_duss4c9	0	*	I read that as both extremes of the political spectrum are fascist cunts. Its true, the far left are fucking fascists, freedom of speech is being raped to death around the world. I dont disagree with their principles but I disagree with the way they go about it
t1_duaxi6l	1	*	Spray paint obscenities
t1_duye6n8	1	*	Yes, that's why they are famous. They are punk-feminists who was detained after singing anti-Putin punk pray in a church. It was in 2012, and three of them are spent 6-14 months in prison. 
t1_dumlc3j	0	*	Almost like they vet their sources and interview participants in newsworthy events to generate.... News.  In other news water is wet.

t1_dutni2x	0	*	Japan banned the MMR vaccine in the 90s, yet their rates of autism have gone up since then. Seems like it's because autism is more easily recognised than any link to vaccines...
t1_dur4vj8	1	*	I legit feel this way. I hope I'm at the bottom of the downward spiral. 
t1_duvzg2h	0	*	Look at it from the Russian point of view for once. Most of their land is permafrost and the rest is mud. A little flooding at the equator seems like a pittance to pay in exchange for a halfway livable nation.

t1_duiqwtb	0	*	Worked with a couple of Russian dudes. There is a huge emphasis on machismo, and being 'manly'. I'm not talking about crusty old villagers - these guys spoke perfect English and had the opportunity to work overseas. We had a very obviously gay guy in the office, and these two would continuously snicker at him.
t1_dub1dx1	0	*	The title says that the document was leaked.
t1_duyy65s	0	*	More like Western powers are reluctant to use hackers offensively, since we rely on good diplomatic relations.  Countries who don't have this diplomatic softpower anyway will more easily resort to that and eventually be successful.
t1_duy80dh	0	*	Hey South Korea, it's us, Japan. Remember that time when SK decided to accept a flawed deal? Also, I wouldn't generalize an entire country. It makes you look more stupid than you already are.  My condolences go out to all the sex slaves who were victims of this tragedy.  Love, Japan

t1_dudek64	1	*	You know that Twitter is dead in China right?  these sites have been crushed by these governments when they don't conform to local law.  We have shitty laws too..
t1_duhiwzt	1	*	Agree because people in higher paying jobs are going to be those that pay higher taxes and those with the lower paying jobs are going to be have more negative impact on a country from lower taxes to more chance for ending in welfare  
t1_dunmwli	0	*	Yeah. He was prepared *for his job*. Why is that a bad thing?
t1_duesduh	1	*	Because after a few billion years the mid Atlantic's drifted a fair distance from us. The closest plate boundaries are the Mediterranean, Iceland and the middle of the Atlantic. Have a look at the map on this website: https://www.britannica.com/science/plate-tectonics

t1_dulc5oa	1	*	Not when I was going to school here in Ireland in the 80's and 90's. Religion class was mandatory Catholicism unless you were the lone protestant pupil who got to sit in the back of the class and draw pictures. I didn't mind it though because there was no homework and we usually just sang songs about some shoeshine boy. 
t1_duy6ct4	1	*	What am I looking at? . . . . .    Anyone daring to think outside of the regressive dogma is automatically a Russian bot?
t1_dunjpzd	1	*	Happened to the mob. Young adults got caught up in it as well. Easy when it's us vs. them and someone provides you with something that goes along with your preconceived notions.

t1_duk09yq	1	*	He never said he believed what Putin told him. /s
t1_ducutno	1	*	All that says is that our election system is broken. When Clinton won the popular vote (which means *more people voted for Clinton than Trump, full stop*) and Trump trashed clinton in the electoral college, that right there means that the electoral college does not accurately portray the American people.
t1_duk919j	1	*	can you give us an example of something that is that size? amsterdam size? manhattan? texas? russia?

t1_dui2ybk	1	*	This is specific communities where cultural, self-imposed, ghettos (or at least ghetto-like isolationism) have formed amongst those who follow these tribal traditions. Self selecting ghettoism is happening across the globe, which as counter intuitive as it sounds, is a real problem.
t1_dueumhw	0	*	Boko Haram is not evil. They follow an ideology. It's human nature to label things as black or white, we must avoid doing this so we can understand the motivations and see it from their point of view. They are not evil, they are devout followers of a violent religion. They believe they are doing good, so name calling won't get us anywhere. 
t1_duo7szk	0	*	It's not meant to be a historically accurate representation, it's a city's annual festival, with annual performance roles. It's for everyone, and everyone in the city has equal ownership of it. But we're going to rule that it's good and proper to tell young girls that they can't be a part of it because of their skin?
t1_duwpqoz	1	*	Can confirm. It took me 18 months to finally get a psychiatrist (in Toronto), only for her to move to the US after 6 months of treating me. Now Ive been searching for a psychiatrist again for the past 12 months. 
t1_duv2oz6	0	*	a lot of native philippinos like him, because several cities are beginning to feel safe again under his policies.
t1_duharj8	1	*	I mean, i love my country, i have to otherwise i would go insane living here, but man. The people who live in the USA aren't nearly as smart as you give them credit, a TON of people who won trump the election still love him. He's losing people who were 'maybe he wont be so bad' or 'fuck cliton' but overall if we make it to trump:term 2 i wouldn;t be shocked if he made it back to the white house

t1_duc03ne	1	*	> I've had friends in the military that when they weren't deployed somewhere they were bored to tears. We should do this in the US.  **Day 1:** *2,000 sq miles of Arizona forestland was obliterated today by US soldiers in what is being classified as a case of friendly fire*
t1_durq0z2	1	*	There were many atrocities on many sides  ...  The Koreans should not be forgotten in this rethink !
t1_dut0m3w	1	*	I was in a room with chinese people who generally like xi. I had told them months ago hes going to form a dictatorship, like putin. And they laughed and said of course not! There is a limit! Then he went past the limit late last year by appointing no successor.  Their expression of realization when they read xinhua this afternoon. Ouch. Truth hurts.
t1_duuw0oh	0	*	Wrong. Those are vulgar criminals. Extremely wealthy people are smart enough to use the law to protect their own interests.

t1_dugabd6	0	*	What really put me off is Germans committing genocide, starting 2 world wars and then acting like Trump is the end of the world. But hey some people can't handle mean tweets.
t1_dubxrwg	1	*	The serious issue isn't that bots or shills or whatever are trying to influence american politics on social media; the real issue is that people get so worked up over twitter that it works.   Social media makes people insane. It drove Kevin durant to complete insanity
t1_duxrlrp	1	*	> Iran seems past due for another revolution  Iranians thought the 1979 was going to create a secular, socialist republic. Get over this idea that revolutions magically fix everything.  Reza Shah was a dick but there's a reason a lot of Iranians pine for those days.

t1_dui7bta	1	*	Yeah, the US is so much better, forcing you to pledge allegiance every morning at school, seizing your property during traffic stops if you happen to travel with something valuable, threatening you with a super harsh sentence if you don't plead guilty and take the prosecutor's deal, forcing you to hand over your electronics and passwords when you enter the country, etc... Sure buddy, the European Union is a gulag.

t1_ducv159	1	*	I'd like to think that someone trying to fuck with the political system of the entire nation is more important than someone threatening to shoot up a few schools in, what, one city, in one county, in one state, of one region, of the country?  The professional school shooter is something that should be taken on by a section of the police that cares about more local things.
t1_dufnr4b	0	*	I suppose it would be different back in England, but if it's the embassy *In Washington* it might go down badly
t1_dud574j	1	*	They are bored because sometimes training is boring, and prepping for training is incredibly boring and has long stretches of waiting for someone else to get something done. There are definitely a lot of days where you are waiting 90 minutes to go home with nothing to do, but not time to mass plant trees. 
t1_duryrrr	1	*	>  a lot of countries its often preceded first with a ramped up media stories and leaks with a propaganda campaign.   Lots of ghouta demonstrations appearing out of nowhere. Demonstrating what? Against indiscriminate bombing of densely populated areas? Directed at whom? Assad and Putin don't give a fuck, so what are these demonstrations hoping to achieve?
t1_duotqoo	0	*	Fairly sure a lot of black people would not be happy with a white MLK. 
t1_dui81fo	1	*	What we need *far* more than tax reform is **spending reform**... we could do twice as much with half the tax income, if the government were forced to     a.) only spend money on goods, services and projects that were truly of the national interest (everything else being the responsibility of state and local governments), and     b.) were forced to pay real-world dollars (wholesale or retail) for those goods and services. The stories of the $500 toilet seats are *not* apocryphal...
t1_dunoaza	0	*	>The shots are so simple .. but those dots represent so much.  Very well put, and I couldn't agree more.   This astronomer (Victor Buso) just happened to be pointing his personal telescope at a random galaxy to test a new camera. And in a ridiculous stroke of luck, he happened to be taking a series of images during the hour this millions-of-years-old star happened to blow itself apart. 
t1_dulw1lx	0	*	I don't even believe that Russian bot story. Pro guns and Government must be making up stuff to try and stop the debate as fast as possible. Selling guns is good for their economy. Shooting at school? Every single time the number of gun selling is raising. They go in front of a mic, make some crocodile tears, say they must do something for it to stop, and then they go back on their usual business until the next shooting happen.
t1_dupio7n	1	*	USA has the largest debt of any nation in history. The credit card bill will arrive some day.
t1_durun3y	1	*	Weirdly, if the Arctic ice melted it wouldn't make much of a difference. If the Greenland glaciers melt however, that's a different story as they're sitting on land. A lot of methane would be released if that happened too...

t1_dur0nup	0	*	My coworker is from Nigeria, he shows me weekly new stories from home about corruption and embezzlement.      Like this clerk that says a snake came into her office and ate the equivalent of $100,000.      http://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-43030827      It is absolutely a great sentiment by Bill Gates, however I think its more likely that money will disappear without paying anything.  I hope I am wrong.  
t1_dussch4	1	*	Shhhhhh,  we don't want to encourage the  1%  
t1_dudh4ep	1	*	Trump is a narcissist, In his mind he won the presidency because of his skill and charm. Remember how he kept claiming he only lost the popular vote because of voter fraud and how he would show election maps to White House visitors?  The idea that Russia helped him win undermines that idea and would feel like a personal attack.

t1_duql725	1	*	Incredible. I haven't looked at that sub in a few years, but last I checked it was just a bunch of conspiracy loons, which was mildly amusing. Just looked at it and it's basically a right-wing news feed. Like there doesn't really seem to be any emphasis on conspiracy theories, it's just a far-right echo chamber.

t1_dueqmsp	1	*	Nah, this is about a bunch of bad business people wanting a bailout for their failure to change over the last 15 years.   They don't really care about playing nice. 
t1_ducgiki	1	*	That's the great thing about Trump. Not only have they got him helping with the sanctions, but he is divisive and they can cause twice as much trouble bringing him down as they caused in helping get him elected.

t1_dund45t	1	*	I sure hope not that soon
t1_dudzacw	0	*	If you look at stagnating wages vs inlation in the 1970s  what do you think about their effects? Could we already be in a period of inflation which is just not being measured along the same units? Could home ownership be used a metric to gage inflation? http://www.bbc.com/news/business-43075099
t1_dusxw6t	1	*	Angela Merkel can be voted out by her party or the general public. That's how it works in a parliamentary system. People don't vote for a single leader, they vote for the party that a leader is a member of.   Are you seriously trying to argue that Germany is a dictatorship?
t1_duq3q6v	1	*	To be clear, I do feel the women's accusations may be true. How their government proceeded with the case did have political overtones, which should not take away from their being deserving of justice.
t1_dun6i5t	1	*	Britain was the original Brexit  Fuck you France we can't take your chanson music and your lazy french ways any longer, you don't even close your mouths when you eat, we're off, and so the island of British left the continent to remain just outside far enough away that it could still smell it's fancy boulangeries from a distance but far enough to be free of their gallic ways

t1_dudxr74	1	*	They still are. Down to 4 members of the AB after the 5th finishes their current case. In fairness, this predates Trump,  the US have been threatening to take their ball home for a while because they got ruled against a few times.

t1_duia7i1	0	*	No, because then they lose control of where and how that money is being spent. Gates can do more individually with his resources towards helping people than the government ever would. 
t1_duhwfcl	1	*	This happens regularly in Canada.  Local governments(city, province) will regularly give out surplus dollars with the usually obvious goal of using it to get more votes come election season and stay in power.
t1_duht3g5	1	*	Try telling that to your average Trump supporter out in Alabama. They think his Twitter antics are what makes him a great president. Republicans dont want to make the country better. They just want to troll democrats.

They're depleting their own fishing stocks and taking advantage of lax enforcement in richer waters. It will only stop when countries start standing up to them like Argentina is, but a lot of developing nations (especially in Africa) are economically reliant on China as an investor and import market and they don't want to bite the hand that feeds them.

t1_duqpblm	1	*	Turning Gates on Manafort makes it much easier for a Manafort prosecution.  Gates can provide nuanced details of every communication and deal, every fraud.

t1_dumu8zv	1	*	Good the jewish people were not treated like that everywhere during WW2
t1_ducxh05	1	*	In my opinion the coup was real, however there is some indication that Russia tipped of Erdogan a few days earlier. Why Russia?  Alexander Dugin was in Turkey a few days before the coup, plus it would cause Turkey to drift away from NATO. Erdogan then let the coup go through to consolidate power.

t1_dupjuc0	1	*	The most popular opposition are the Communists or the LDPR.   Even Navalny is far right, it's just that he wants to move towards the west and end Russian isolationism. So the West pushes him as a modern liberal and popular candidate, ignoring that the real popular guys are the Reds. 
t1_dukchna	1	*	I don't understand why reddit is shitting on them, 1,000,000 trees might not be much in the scheme of things but it's a milestone that they've hit without much publicity - they've only got 1500 followers on their twitter, for example.  If people donated and helped out instead of whining on reddit then maybe they could push that number far far higher.  1,000,000 trees is a lot more useful to the planet than sitting around /r/politics all day upvoting every anti-trump article you see

t1_dutll6b	1	*	Have people always not known when to stay in their lane or is it easier to see now?  I leave medicine to doctors, science to scientists (and specialities within that), engineering to the engineers. Just because you have feelings or an opinion mean that they are valid, ignorance is a dangerous thing.   It's okay to ask questions, I would say it's actually a really important thing to do but listen to informed opinions not a fucking picture with some text on it in Facebook feed.
t1_dulcbgk	1	*	look, Poles don't have a movie every year about the holocaust showing what happened to them. It really isn't common knowledge what Polish people suffered during the war. Would it be if everybody studied it? Sure. But there aren't even very many books about what happened to gentile Poles. Jews need to stop playing the anti-semite card when someone else wants a chance to speak about the holocaust.

t1_duwiy7r	1	*	I cant speak for you, but I had two parents.
t1_duqq8cv	1	*	Because Manafort owes a ton of money to some REALLY bad hombres. The kind who stick polonium in your sandwich. 
t1_dusct04	1	*	I read a book about the Japanese invasion and occupation of Korea. Heart and gut wrenching. 
t1_dugdaup	1	*	If that's your logic, will you be totally fine if a Muslim country deports all africans?   I mean, their country, their choice? Right?
t1_dut81mt	1	*	Id love for us to just ignore them for a while, maybe russia can help them out.
t1_duj7c1z	0	*	Is that, like, reverse electroshock therapy?
t1_duksrth	1	*	True, but bump stocks were used in Vegas which had more casualties  I agree though, that the ban isn't going to stop people from doing mass shootings  
t1_dupl76l	1	*	Maybe new chairs.. maybe a new copier.
t1_duq61j0	1	*	You are awake, the world really is this way, we have all been sleeping for so long that we let everything go to hell 
t1_dua0hg1	0	*	No. The Mongols tried to invade Japan several times in the 13th century. And every time their invasion fleet was destroyed by heavy storms. People believed that a higher power was responsible for this. Kami (gods) kaze (wind). This created the myth that Japan is under divine protection, and so no one dared to attack the country until the 19th century. The fascists just revived this old myth for their suicide bombers in WW2.
t1_duulj0f	1	*	My people and the Icelanders had [The Cod Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cod_Wars) but there was only one (accidental) death fortunately, so that was more of a series of tense moments than an actual war
t1_dubkqbw	1	*	Anyone know if there's counter bots stirring the Russian pot? Or are is this tendency to exploit limited to American culture and all of its narscassim 
t1_duaoj19	1	*	I forgot all about this but might have to take his lead.  Last year, they came to fill in the potholes on my street. But they only filled every other pothole. I am not even kidding. It was every other pothole. Not the big ones, nor was it only the small ones. I laughed so hard when I noticed what they did.
t1_dut8ehc	1	*	Ya, the western world has a particular reaction to the concept of Dictator. 
t1_duib1mb	0	*	They won't stop, the Russian mentality is always that everyone else is cheating too and just singling Russia out for political reasons or russophobia. 
t1_duq8shn	0	*	That's not entirely true, they did make eye contact that one time Gates brought Trump his coffee.
t1_dumdmys	1	*	exactly what I came here to say. early in the article it says policymakers and researchers need to work together. First thing I thought is that policy makers will be the one abusing this shit to get another moron into the white house that they can make a few million off of.
t1_dugfk07	1	*	At least one of them will be stupid enough to visit Spain, The Maldives, or Sri Lanka and get nabbed.

t1_dui9u1k	1	*	Redistribution of income. The increased tax revenue (if done right) can be used to stimulate economic growth, implement better fiscal policy to help the less fortunate, give poorer people more opportunities, training, education, public amenities, etc. Of course this hinges on governments actually doing their job right not going well sorry, we ain't in the business of being a government, thoughts and prayers, y'all
t1_duhozy0	1	*	That's called confirmation bias
t1_dua1d4s	1	*	>What NK does is an act of self harm. This is more like betting high on a really bad hand in poker.  Literally the opposite would be an apt analogy.  NK is trying to run things with a HORRIBLE hand.  The UK absolutely decided on their own to do this shit and it is indeed self harm.
t1_dusuae6	1	*	And, ironically, *vice versa*.
t1_dubtegj	0	*	I find it hilarious that everyone who replied to you so far is just tooting the horn of their own preconceptions instead of [linking to the actual methodology.](http://securingdemocracy.gmfus.org/publications/methodology-hamilton-68-dashboard)  Pretty clear difference between the people who actually want to know things and those who just want to look smart.
t1_duhv2b9	0	*	From the article. >Faivre would have been a strong contender for a place in the France team for the mixed sex Alpine team event, which makes its Olympic debut on Saturday.
t1_duvbcii	1	*	I'm never going to be able to cut meat & diary 100% but I've cut down a little bit.   It helps you try new things like falafel, and new recipes like stuffed peppers, with rice, beans, and corn salsa (mmm). And seafood isn't mentioned at all, but that's general pretty healthy and tasty :)

t1_dug28gw	0	*	Damn, he really has a bad memory, and it's declining quickly if he was able to remember this 4 days ago but can't remember it now.    I guess if we give the president the benefit of assuming he's not lying, we have to worry that he has a growing memory problem.  
t1_dup7epj	0	*	Well he poked our black page of history, Srebrenica too.  I'd say a purposeful genocide is a tad bit worse.   Our governments don't like each other very much.  There is a Turkish minority in the Netherlands, I hope we as citizens could still get along.  
t1_dua5df9	0	*	This isn't a scandal. This is the cleanup.
t1_dug3i6i	1	*	The division of America is built on the profit drive of the media conglomerates. It's good for business
t1_dubbg9g	1	*	How bad is it?
t1_dux646q	1	*	He's retiring. Probably why he felt comfortable voicing an opinion such as this. 
t1_ducz9fj	1	*	How about just being skeptical in general, regardless who is the person speaking. Simplifies the task of finding the good guys one is supposed to believe unquestionably. There is none. Be skeptical of all information and thus one automatically catches also the bad guys. Also the ones disguised as good guys.
t1_dutvffm	1	*	A decade ago in school, we were given ocean fishing as an example of the 'Tragedy of the Commons', whereby people are quite happy to fully exploit shared resources with no thought towards their long-term preservation
t1_dumi3oq	1	*	Yes exactly. You take them off the soft target list 
t1_duac5hd	0	*	Oblivious idiots remain oblivious... If any of you actually read the leaked emails from the Clinton camp you too would want anyone but Clinton, perhaps one of the most corrupt and sinister crime families in modern political memory.  Mind you Wikileaks has a 100% accuracy in their reporting and leaks thus far, but go ahead and trust un-named sources, a rumor has it, leaked documents, someone close to the source, etc..
t1_duba5z0	0	*	Or.. more than 400,000 civilians in Syria since 2011. 
t1_duxiuyc	1	*	They were told to fuck off since they're cis-gendered, patriarchal, islamaphobic, capitalistic oppressors, so they're letting them handle their own problems. 
t1_duskicm	1	*	Lol
t1_dutsyaa	1	*	I believe receiving money in exchange for permission to put the Trump name on buildings is one of Trump's more profitable activities. Makes sense. Its got to be virtually 100% profit. Sign the contract saying they can use your name, collect the check, let someone else go through the expense and hassle of actually doing construction.  As for why people pay money just to put his name on a building, maybe they figure any kind of name recognition is better than being lost in the crowd?
t1_duwauua	1	*	Climate change is already causing major problems with climate shifts all over the world. It's just getting started, and it's not going to slow down without a huge shift in human behavior.  There are more than enough people in the world, with many more on the way. You can contribute a lot more to future generations by adopting, mentoring, teaching, fighting worthwhile political battles, and so on. Ultimately it's your decision.
t1_duxysrx	1	*	Why do you think there's zero chance of them doing that?
t1_duuyjo2	0	*	It's too bad.  The world had a chance to support Ukraine against the Russian invasion and wussed out.  Now tyranny is what we get.
t1_dun31a0	0	*	Because it's an intimate relationship, things become more difficult.   I suppose part of the rationale is common assault in the street by random people is taken seriously and escalated by members of the public/victim involved, and domestic abuse has a tendency to be hidden by the victim/victims go out of their way to lie about it or defend the actions of the abusers.   Many victims go on years with their abuser before even mentioning it to others, and have more psychological damage as a result
t1_due2vhu	0	*	Im not catholic dont know anything about it but apparently I know everything about it.  
t1_duykfsr	0	*	Straws don't bring plea deals. 
t1_due76qk	1	*	gee - 'if the price hikes are causing insurance companies to pay most of this then what is the effect on the system?'  - pretty sure this is the reason why premiums always go up.  - ALWAYS go up.   business/corporate-wise Shkreli did nothing 'wrong' - but 'ethically', imho, he is immoral.  Unfortunately, these days, the concept of Business Ethics is more and more becoming an oxymoron. 
t1_dujkw3t	0	*	remind me why we can't bring him up on treason charges?  Also:  kindly remind me what's the constitutionally-prescribed penalty for treason? 
t1_dua8l25	0	*	And its not just Japan, literally every person in the world with a functioning brain thinks its an incredibly stupid idea.   It was literally a joke/political stunt that they assumed would get voted down. But then a bunch or retards had a huge marketing campaign full of outright lies, and rallied nationalism/racism/xenophobia so it passed.
t1_dure3p2	1	*	This makes me really sad. I really want to document stories from these individuals but is so hard to find them, especially those from the eastern front.
t1_dueamwb	0	*	Can confirm. Companies will totally leave USA for foreign soil based on taxes. They will completely forego the largest economic market in the world based only on being taxed slightly higher. Who needs extra revenues of billions when you can save millions...
t1_dur8680	1	*	What time does the train leave? I got a few things to do first but you better not leave without me 
t1_duo9z20	0	*	If you are not responsible enough to own a rifle at 18, then you are not responsible enough to vote. Either fully treat an 18 year old as an adult, or fully treat them as minor.
t1_duajitk	1	*	Nah it'll be all like Call for a *totally free* information package and then never mention a price, like they do for Bowflexes and Bose systems, because if you heard the price you'd nope outta there pretty quick.
t1_duj6dsa	1	*	Maybe just maaybe most countries openly despise gay people? Outside of the western nations I believe being a homo is still a crime in alot of places.
t1_duv248v	1	*	Of course he does. I think its been pretty obvious now that he is a narcissist. Just take a look on /r/raisedbynarcissists to see how many posts on there where their parents have this strange admiration for dictators like Adolf Hitler.
t1_duyxhxo	0	*	Yah good luck doing anything about it in US with Drumpf in office.  If anything he would try to replace plastic food wrapping with clean coal.  Trump also directed his FDA to start adding Flouride to our drinking water (can't make this shit up).  
t1_dujjtx7	0	*	He was absolutely denying it. He asked Putin himself and took Putin's word for it, like that even meant anything.  The weak stance on Russia he's been pushing this entire time doesn't help either.
t1_dur5s84	0	*	Sorry, but the company is traded on New York  stock exchange, and have very little with Norway to do, and absolutely nothing with the Norwegian government.  https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/nhy.ol
t1_durdcps	1	*	That's require international support, so it seems a tad less likely, this is a unilateral action by the US (in addition to the international sanctions) and China seems to be somewhat unhappy about a ramping up of sanctions without their consent..

t1_dun2sg2	1	*	Does the employer provide free meals or not is actually my first question on every single job interview
t1_dui7qgg	0	*	You cannot legally move money made within the US overseas and not get taxed on it. People can't do it. Corporations can't do it. If they do, it's tax evasion and it's illegal.
t1_duva080	0	*	You say that with a lot of certainty, were you around in 13th century England? People have debated the existence of Robin Hood for centuries, it's probably impossible to know for sure if the story is based on a real criminal. 
t1_dui8aw6	0	*	Long term capital gains is only 20%.

t1_dut5i3w	1	*	We could, but that wont change until enough of us call our lawmakers daily. This change will never happen by wishing we could. Be a voice that is heard by your local representatives and encourage others to keep calling and emailing. Jam up their lines if you have to. Politicians will keep acting in their best interests until WE CHANGE.

t1_dub8ev1	1	*	I dont know but this article had a doctor saying the opposite, a lower mortality rate but higher incidents of stroke. Regarding aspirin.. I thought this was common knowledge, along with the effect on kidney function (with some studies showing as temporary & reversible). Its like a trade off between dying of a heart attack or dying from bleeding out

t1_dufjjul	1	*	 If FDR was brought back from the grave and made president tomorrow, it wouldn't surprise me if he just seized all of the assets of the republicans who voted for this tax cut.  He will give them back as soon as the tax cut pays for itself. 
t1_duib6qt	1	*	Throwing money at ghettos does not help them. Life isnt that simple. But people like simple ideas and simple solutions.   > look there are poor people there > look, there is a horrible rich white male there > the world will be a better place if we take the money from the rich and redistribute it to the poor. Problems will be solved!   See how easy it is? Thats why so many people want this. 
t1_dugx2l2	0	*	what?

t1_dualqg6	0	*	and sure is bullshit  Moscow had the biggest snowfall in a century and my territory on the outskirts is properly cleaned. Yes, they can't dig your car out (it's not their task) and some roads became narrower (again, mostly due to parked cars dug under a pile of snow).  But I never had to complain to local authorities, let alone, look participate in karmawhoring for the snow to be cleared.

t1_duj3vc8	1	*	Speaking about the troll's salaries wouldn't be complete without mentioning the 50 cent trolls from China & Russia.  For every reply they got to whatever their comment may have been on whichever social media, would earn them 50 cents.  Once you know that, they're a little easier to spot, say on Youtube.  They'll start their comments or inane replies about the time the US is winding down or  is asleep.  Also on Youtube, they usually have very weak profile accounts.
t1_dua9res	0	*	This is news because now the narrative that is being pushed is :  Wikileaks stood against hilary      THEREFORE They want to destabilize America      THEREFORE They work for the Russians.    Have seen this train of thought so many times in the past couple of days in here.

t1_dupiqqy	0	*	But if we started earlier, our price per kw/h wouldn't have to be so high. That's due to some kind of tax. (Eeg umlage) we pay the second highest price in europe. I'm all for green energy, but if people can't afford electricity it's hard to get everyone hyped.

How can a rich and modern country like Germany have slower internet than my grandma's small village in Bulgaria that didn't even have electricity for the longest time?   It's obvious the Telekom with their monopoly won't ever do shit since it is *always* more profitable to just get money for people being forced to use their old infrastructure...
t1_durodbp	0	*	My favorite is the old saw, it's cold outside so no climate change, this article is saying, it's hot outside so climate change, that's not how it works.

t1_dudzp4e	0	*	> After the x files finished its first season, the applications for female FBI agents skyrocketed    The release of Silence of the Lambs a few years prior probably helped in that as well. An argument could be made that there would be no Dana Scully if it wasn't for Clarice Starling.
t1_duc1xcv	0	*	Or the German route and never stop acknowledging their flawed past and seek to correct things. Ignoring the crimes of the past has caused Japan no small measure of diplomatic grief with her neighbours.

t1_duydq5p	1	*	You still think this is about who won the election...  You're OK with a foreign country attacking our democracy because you think it taints Trump's presidency if you even acknowledge that reality. You'd rather just ignore a hostile intelligence service attacking our country because it's inconvenient for your beliefs.   That's fucked.

t1_dupunmc	0	*	My first question would be if they have a national debt. If they do then the surplus should just go to pay down the debt. If there is no national debt then to me the responsible thing to do is to save it. Economies go up and down. Next year their economy could go down resulting in a deficit.

t1_dunicdk	1	*	If you but a street-soda in Taiwan and many other Asian countries they give it to you in a plastic bag with a straw.

t1_duia1fu	1	*	There's a difference between saying everyone should do x and  I should do x. Some ideas only work well if everyone is in on it. Traffic laws are an example that comes to mind. If I'm the only person who stops at a red light, it's not going to to work all that well. However, everyone stopping at a red light seems to be a pretty decent system.

t1_duvgop9	1	*	To be fair, he has way better reasons for being the ruthless authoritarian he is than Trump does.
t1_duguwbt	1	*	Yep. No matter what your political opinion is there's certain issues that people in power and people who aren't should focus on. Without division. But people won't put their differences aside.   Or even work together to find a middle ground...  On Reddit they'd rather insult, belittle or ignore.

t1_dupctvw	0	*	It's legal political donation, definitely not corruption.  You should just believe every claim from media & NGOs, it's wrong to doubt the objectivity of NGOs & media.
t1_dub6nup	1	*	You make it sound like every other country has great mental health care?   Even if they did (they don't) surely there would have been some point in recent history where that wasn't the case, yet mass shootings were not commonplace. 
t1_duwl70h	0	*	I don't think everyone thinks their pay is too high, so much as they tend to get pretty high pay while other hard working health industry members get peanuts while putting a ton of work and care into their jobs. Sure medical school and such has different costs, that doesn't mean you have to underpay medical professionals who aren't doctors.
t1_ducvpmt	1	*	For those of you who care, I recommend you skim this (you can skip the parts that are just listing names). Its as direct a source as you can get, and a lot of it is written in plain English

t1_duooist	1	*	Not a crime in my side of the fence.
t1_dupdhe7	1	*	> racing games were the only relation they'd found between video games and physiological indicators associated with violence.  I've read that police in various places would increase presence during the release of Fast & Furious movies because people tended to drive worse after coming out of the theater.   Maybe the human brain is just always looking for an excuse to turn us into bad drivers.
t1_duje3do	1	*	Yeah Im sceptical about a sensationalised account of it. I find it believable, but at the same time I just dont trust a reddit headline at all. 
t1_durtcvr	1	*	Right to free speech means the government cannot punish or censor you. It does not mean protecting yourself from the consequences of your words or action.

t1_duljsc8	1	*	Billy was a registered democrat and a friend of my mother-in-laws family. She is ardent that Billy graham was far more liberal than most people know. In fact, he does not speak on many social issues, viewing them as a distraction to the preaching of the gospel.  Edit: a word
t1_dugcr6m	1	*	The person featured in the article has been living their for 7 years, how is that a good deal? He also has an college degree...I'm sure not everyone has found stability like him but everyone is getting deported.
t1_dusoodz	1	*	This is hilarious. Why would you need to start a war in Syria just to build a pipeline? Going around Syria would be cheaper and easier.
t1_dudi50n	1	*	> Fox 59 in Indianapolis, Indiana, on Monday reported that a father has claimed that his wife tried MMS as an autism treatment on their child and that the Department of Child Services has since removed their child from their home.   It sounds like child services is treating this seriously. Small blessings. If your parent values that life so little you really needed to be put in a new home anyway.

t1_dudlfpg	1	*	Dude this is more or less the bottom. Russia obviously interfered by backing trump and others (like bernie) all in the goal of creating chaos, and it worked. Trump did not collude in the way many people wish he did, he's just in complete denial that russians thought putting him in office would be detrimental to the US
t1_dut9596	1	*	....So why don't you people do something about it? 
t1_dusq00x	1	*	Don't believe the news guys, this guys friend says it all okay!
t1_duvrj51	0	*	Solid explanation, with numbers to back up your claims, and Im pretty far right... but you do make sense. Im actually interested in a reasonable discussion, so people saying its the Muslims arent interested in reasonable discussion and should be downvoted.   Do you think it has anything to do with universities reporting rapes? And the possibility of false accusations as weve seen recently? 
t1_dumco74	1	*	Not if the school hasn't secured parent consent. Only a handful of kids can sign themselves out.
t1_dupz3jc	1	*	Because it's not about supporting a side, it's about sowing discord. What they want is for both sides to act like it's the other side and talk/understand less/communicate less.

When they read more about the forest wondering, maybe there was a softer/smarter side of Trump, they will have that ah hah! moment  and realize it was all just a long con to reinforce how much of a dolt he is. Great learning / discovery experience waiting for future generations!

t1_dupfk2s	0	*	Yeah- fuck spending committments and hope someone else bankrolls your safety for you.
t1_dudcuml	1	*	To be honest, I think it's more of a personal preference thing. I've always been a sweet tooth kind of person, so pretty much any type of coffee which is still recognizable as such is unpalatable to me.   I generally start my work day with an energy drink, while my coworkers have a cup of coffee. When we go to the bar, they're all about craft brews, but I gravitate to hard ciders. I suspect that it has more to do with sweet/bitter preferences.

t1_duz582v	1	*	People like you say these things because they dont know how investigations work. Look at past presidential investigations for a clue as to how long they take to build. Plus, this one has been leak proof since the start which is massively positive. 
t1_dulprvu	1	*	Well, you don't really need to talk about religion when you teach someone about being kind or abortion

Campaigned on that platform.  He was elected to murder drug addicts.  He was elected.  He is now murdering drug addicts.  Why are people surprised about this?  There's nothing about democracy that implies an equitable justice system 
t1_duqk99r	1	*	Yes and no.  Mueller can come at them with state charges which Trump has no control over.  Also Trump pardoning them would be a very bad look from Trump, which means ya he still might do it.

t1_dui60p4	0	*	Your situation is an extremely common one for people our age. Theres going to be another housing crisis in many nations. Millennials are being asked to stimulate the economy but to do so without money. The bottom is going to fall out eventually. Its only a matter of time. You cant ask an entire generation of people to contribute their money if theyre not receiving any.
t1_duq0lcm	0	*	The dumbest part of the whole thing is it could be done so many other ways.  Increase subsidies for black farmers.  Pay the white farmers with generations of farming experience to pass on their knowledge.  Insist that a white run farm has to have X number of black South Africans in management learning while working so they can go on to found their own farms ......   That's what I thought up in about 15 seconds;  all better ideas than a smash and grab.

I mean damn.
t1_dulp5kf	1	*	Canada has the Low Income Cut Off (LICO), it is a bit more granular based on household unit size and community size. In Canada, a one person household is is considered under the LICO (poverty line) at $24,969 - and that is with all our social supports and universal healthcare. $12,000 is unlivable.   http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/75f0002m/2009002/s2-eng.htm

t1_dubu71b	0	*	Reactions like this are just attempts to hide the problem. Easy to ignore. The proper fix is education and critical thinking.
t1_dudzqx5	1	*	you fail to realize there is a very limited amount of guns there, after a shooting hand guns were banned. If guns were banned in the US then the defense of a reasonable officer wouldn't work and they would stop shooting people because that wouldn't be an expectation.

t1_dunpglt	0	*	This is reddit... take your logic and rational thought elsewhere!   But seriously, this headline is retarded. Qatar's Al Jazeera talking about human rights and lumping Trump in with other dictators... can't name one human right Trump has taken away. This is absurd but it's also liberal reddit. Thankfully when I read comments like yours and a lot of others in this thread actually, I realize that there's still plenty of people who can think and have their own ideas.

t1_duqn7ln	0	*	> From the Statement of the Offence (.pdf, see page 7) he lied to Mueller's team during a proffer session.  Jesus. All the horrible things Mueller had to choose from, and that's what he uses for the plea deal. That Gates lied in his statement to the FBI? So much for Gates' credibility as a witness. Manafort's defense attorney is going to have a field day with that one.

t1_durmmbp	1	*	Yeah, we really don't want to hear his opinion.  I'm conservative on the issue so I'm definitely biased, but I like to think even if I was liberal I would understand that having their PM suggest we try Australian style gun control would just make the right dig in further and make compromise even less likely.  
t1_dues8d5	0	*	Same with Twitter. Fuckers are war profiteers, period.
t1_dumxoh5	1	*	Exactly this.  I want to believe them, but I'd be a fool to reference professional trolls as my source in a debate on the matter.

t1_dutlfrh	1	*	The #1 killer of Americans is heart disease.    Perhaps you should have the government force people to get on a diet.   This is a serious response.   People have rights to their own bodies.  You can't mandate everything.
t1_duui2hu	0	*	Myanmar has over 130 ethnic groups. Probably 128 of them live together just fine. This is a very different thing than the other events you mentioned.  Actually, Jews are one of the ethnic groups in Myanmar that do quite well. There is a beautiful synagogue in Yangon and many people have Jewish ancestors in the area.
t1_duuisix	1	*	On a long enough timescale there are precedents for all sorts of things. But we are observing extremely rapid changes. Like the difference between me shooting a gun at you or just tossing you the bullet. Only one of these if going to kill you.

t1_dui8zsn	1	*	Thats just ridiculous.  Youre basically slave labor working for free at that point.    So you make 100million in a year providing a service that customers want you are only entitled to 5.5million?    We see what billionaires do when tax rates are too high, they send their money overseas.  Why on earth would expect them to live here making a nickel for every dollar they make?

t1_dupfg7e	1	*	just like he said he can imagine 10% to 40% percent of teachers to be fit to be armed. like, wtf? pulling numbers out of his ass. sadly, the U.S. politics have come down to a quite comedic shitshow. extremely sad that this show is played at the expense of the children and innocent people.
t1_dubmmla	1	*	You're kidding?
t1_duovpgo	1	*	Its a harassing tactic. Screws up your schedule when you have to be constantly in and out of jails and courts. 
t1_duj26ks	1	*	Not really. We are mostly tolerant, but due to our government's idiotic propaganda line and our vocal minority you may think that we all are some weird freaks...  I don't expect you to believe me (and it's a part of that propaganda of our gov - raising hatred between us and anybody else), but still.

t1_due5w3s	0	*	It's kinda ironic that people question the legitimacy of the Chinese threat while at the same time claiming that the Chinese is a big enough threat to increase defense spending. Which one is it?

t1_dupft1n	0	*	Hopefully pay back our debts.
t1_duafbtd	1	*	Well blocking the syrian economy from recovering is considered why the US pushed the SDF to charge the oil / gas fields, and to attempt to block the border crossing at abu kamal alongside al tanf.    Infact the SDF offensive against ISIS more or less ended once the SAA captured the US goal of abu kamal, where they have no opened trade with Iraq again, much to Americas protest. 
t1_duwc13n	1	*	> change their phones every year  If they sell it that's fine. The phone still get's used for x years. Most people buy the newest iphone for 1000$ then sell it when the new one come out with ~200-300$ loss.  I guess that's a fair price to always have a top notch phone...
t1_duq5xkc	0	*	I understand why - from a middle management point of view - this makes sense... But isn't it just entrenching inefficiency into the company overall?  Yes, that may be a smart move for *your branch* but later on when the company overall is ailing because of the numerous inefficiencies like this have added up, the executives don't know where the money went, and everyone begins to suffer (layoffs etc).  I mean - that even happened in the show (Dunder mifflin going under). 
t1_duu4dto	1	*	Chlorine gas attacks in Syria are not really considered 'chemical attacks', they've been a common occurrence for years. They are also not especially lethal and cause less deaths than conventional bombs, the Assad Regime is using them more as a terror weapon, to frighten the population even further.   When US/Europe says 'chemical attack', they mean nerve agents like Sarin. 
t1_dupnxtn	1	*	Ouch dude! 
t1_dudrbuv	1	*	No, Blade was actually good on it's own and wasn't fueled by political agendas.
t1_dugnhal	1	*	They are official presidential statements because they're statements *made by the president*. But they have no *legal standing* - it would be no different than if a president had made a statement at a news conference. That's because they are not *Executive Orders* which is an entirely different thing. 
t1_dulb9c0	0	*	Learning about religion isn't banned, it's just not a mandatory subject in of itself.

t1_dup9xtw	1	*	r/WTF
t1_duycwem	0	*	Eh. Remember when we were bound by treaty to have just the most basic military and we were in the worst economical crisis in history? Took us about 5 years to go from that to a place where we could take on the whole world and it was actually close. And our starting position is a lot better now in every respect.

t1_duvh9cj	1	*	it is pretty bipolar yesterday they were saying they have their arsenal only trained on the U.S. which was probably some poor assurance towards SK instead of Japan now that I think about it. Still, it's apparent to me that they do this rhetoric for aid purposes as well as saving face in the typical SEA manner.
t1_duiwgoi	0	*	Also, many British students are choosing to study in European countries like the Netherlands because it is cheaper than paying UK tuition fees.

t1_durp24a	0	*	Hmm, I do think a lot of the stigma of weed comes from it being illegal. I for one am in fact surprised by this study, but everyone here is like obviously!   To be clear, I am all for the legalization of marijuana. I'm just surprised at the results of this study, because I honestly thought more people would be down to try it if it was indeed legal. 
t1_duouzk2	1	*	Diplomatic immunity, bro. Give me my cocaine back!
t1_duqr3dr	0	*	The media wouldn't have reported on it if it were a democrat. And this article is based on a cnn report by newsweek. Both very unreliable and probably spun hard

t1_dugxkl5	1	*	Oh yes, Im sure those 800 million users were all using wikipedia for the sole purpose of writing academic papers. 
t1_duc3zn9	0	*	I agree. This is not one of those times. He didn't buy a block of mid-price housing, he bought one building for 80 million. When you start playing at that level, the nationality of the buyer is barely a factor. 
t1_duxnu4g	1	*	Unfortunately, the overall situation in Mexico is way worse than what's happening in Russia, to the point that Mexicans should be happy to live in a place like Russia.
t1_duo1wpa	0	*	Actually, the word used in the bible, ratsakh, means murder, not the broader kill. Killing of one another by warring factions would definitely not have fallen under this definition.

t1_dul3am0	0	*	Would you say that you don't feel sex is generally worth it with a Condom on? I had a long term boyfriend who we never used condoms with, and when I finally started getting out again I noticed the first guy I asked to wear one really wasn't happy about it.   I still don't care what he thinks because it's my body, but it made me wonder if it's even worth seeking out quickies if guys hate them that much. 
t1_dui9xe9	1	*	Just out of curiosity, What is your tax rate compared to that of a billionaire?

t1_duk00fl	0	*	I sware there's a name for this sort of phenomenon, but for now ill call it, positive spite. Honestly it shows how sometimes all you have to do is annoy and bother people correctly and they do exactly what they should be doing in the first place. God bless our president.

t1_dul3v2q	0	*	This is so true. The history of the country demonstrates that it was divided from the start. People need to accept this instead of blaming others. The whole 'we could unite if not for others' is complete garbage and a failure to take responsibility. Everyone says to unite but there is no consensus on what this unity would look like.
t1_due2ai2	1	*	Shades of Shkreli?

By being the quintessential shitpump is how.

t1_duss5jc	1	*	You are pretty pathetic, yes.
t1_due1ilz	1	*	While I agree the price difference isnt right, the $36 for raw materials is also disingenuous. testing, line waste, stability, facility and process improvements all add in too. But yeah, probably not a 200x cost since a lot of those are spread over multiple drugs.

Profit encourages investment in the most demanded products and services.   Without these core foundations your society is going to be inefficient and destructive. It's that simple. 
t1_dulfl2e	1	*	And you are talking about secondary school religion classes in Ireland specifically?
t1_dupw3dj	1	*	Why wouldn't performance drugs help? Not all these drugs are to get people jacked. Many help stamina, muscle control, and energy.
t1_dubti5j	1	*	As a veteran I can tell you we do things all the time for the community that were in. When I was stationed at Holloman we had an event called keeping Alamogordo beautiful. Alamogordo was the town next to our base and and we had hundreds of volunteers from the bass go out to Alamogordo to do things like pick up trash help the elderly and paint houses built by Habitat for Humanity. There were constant volunteer opportunities for us throughout the year

t1_duyt152	0	*	Yup -- APT28 is also known as Fancy Bear, which, along with its sister group Cozy Bear, was responsible for Russia's intrusion of DNC systems in 2015 and 2016. Russia is actively waging cyberwar against the West. And it's winning. It's difficult to overstate how dangerous the current situation is.

t1_duprqxb	1	*	Germany's situation is very much about how getting into the Euro makes their exports more competitive. At the great expense of other countries in the Euro.  They've gotten a green light to such a lot of the money out of the rest of the EU. And they're taking advantage of it (as expected). The other EU countries really should get together and try to correct this. It's in their best interest to modify the terms.

t1_duw2vw7	1	*	It's pretty easy when climate change experts are caught fabricating data just as often as deniers are caught ignoring it, and then to add onto that - every one of their predictions is wrong. But once something crazy happens like this they act all smug and say see we knew something was gonna happen.   It's pretty clear to me neither side has a fucking clue what's going on with the weather.

t1_duq8aum	0	*	> Its also unclear how Lee, who has written books about her time in the North Korean army and is now an anti-North Korea campaigner, knows about the treatment of the cheerleaders.  Pretty much.  This is speculation posing as fact.  Tons of horrible things are going on in North Korea.  It doesn't do us any favors to make up atrocities:  That could weaken our case against ones we know are happening.
t1_duylz60	1	*	That CANT be real. I'm looking at it, it's look like real twitter, but it *has* to be fake. I won't believe it. I can't. 
t1_duxzt3q	0	*	Meh you could have churned this comment out any time in the last 60 years and it would have been vaguely relevant to a westerner. At what point do you think you should stop being concerned and just live your life. What are the Russians going to do to you exactly? What are Americans going to do to them? Why should I be concerned as a mid 20's guy living in the UK? 
t1_dueinsw	1	*	To upstage someone is to engage in distracting antics in the background while someone else, downstage, is supposed to be the point of the audiences attention.   
t1_dunbte8	1	*	One of my biggest concerns with the trump presidency, one of many, was that it would do major harm to the economy because tourists wouldnt want to visit, students wouldnt want to come here fearing theyd get deported even if they had a student visa, and people wouldnt bother trying to immigrate here at all cause it was too difficult. Not to mention the economic harm of mass deportation in general.   
t1_duu38ld	1	*	I was going to say that one year is hardly enough evidence to say that more cases of measles were the result of fewer vaccinations, but you put more effort into it.  With that said, please vaccinate your children, people. One thing better than not dying as a matter of random chance is not dying because you didn't get sick to begin with.
t1_duxlmim	0	*	Quadruple quotation marks?
t1_ducnvba	0	*	The first W stands for World. 
t1_dupqku5	0	*	We'd have a surplus too if we let Americans die in hospitals waiting for an appointment.

t1_duqmuwm	0	*	That's some Nazi bullshit you've been smoking.
t1_duaq5vn	0	*	Ummm the United states bullshitted their way into iraq for oil.  Russia is there by invite because the United states is sponsoring terrorist in the region under the guise of an arab spring.  Completely different kettle of fish
t1_dugda6f	1	*	It's wrong period.
t1_duekfnd	1	*	It's on par with hits out for annoying British editorial practices.
t1_duk2yvz	1	*	Those darn wheatfields...she never should have opened up about that one.
t1_dur2r4c	1	*	Neither had adult children while in office and neither Clinton nor Obama have hired their kids to run their businesses, which are all smaller than Trumps. Like it or not but he's using who he trusts and he clearly trusts them with his personal business so at least he's consistent on some fronts 
t1_duvofsv	1	*	Nice! My uncle was a R Admiral running the west coast sub fleet out of Bangor for a few years. He said similar things about certain nations facilitating drug trade. Great way to fund black ops and proxy wars. 
t1_due3m8p	0	*	You clearly have no understanding of pharmaceuticals. How much do you think premiums would go up because of this?
t1_dutp40a	1	*	Why the hell people downvote you guys when actually the header is not well writen? Even the letter casing is awfully wrong on the article...
t1_duna0zp	1	*	> I've never understood this retarded argument.  That's because it isn't an argument that is intended to be rational.  The NRA and republicans have infused their followers with a purely emotional reaction of Guns good, gun control bad, so when faced with a reality that dictates that gun control is needed, they can resort to idiotic arguments like this.
t1_dutw7gu	1	*	France just did that and holy shit did it cause outrage.
t1_dui17ng	1	*	I'm going to get one of them three hundred dollar haircuts, this one's lost its pizazz... 
t1_dutidwu	1	*	Disagree. The government shouldn't be able to force you to accept an injection of any kind on their behalf. What you can do is say you must be vaccinated to use public schools or gyms. 
t1_dupv6in	0	*	Yeah, because if Germany and France had the most up to date military weaponry they'd totally attack Russia like you're suggesting. /s 
t1_duof06p	1	*	Ironically enough, most european and north american countries(looking at you canada) are ignoring their plight.  Cause white people I guess.  Since we know its not about them being from Africa.
t1_duds0e9	0	*	This is a case of not enough capitalism. Patent law for generics is anti-competitive.  Either we make the system more socialized or more capitalist, right now we're stuck in this awkward middle spot that lets people abuse it in this way.  
t1_duykiq4	0	*	I think the hard part about Israel is that if you say anything against Israel, people act like you hate all Jews. I don't hate Jews, I disagree with Israeli policies. Also, that country really needs to remember that they are our bitch. We decide their fate.
t1_duvayjl	1	*	>people are blind and easily manipulated ~~as they were in 90s~~  FTFY
t1_duh5sun	1	*	Astley what you did there.
t1_dux0z72	1	*	So the world has changed that much in two years and you were furious with a pay raise system that was announced almost a decade ago?  Why go into that profession?
t1_duhnz48	1	*	Arctic sea ice is already floating so we could loose it all and the sea level wouldn't rise. 
t1_dup9deh	1	*	He was born in Russia and the only uniforms his parents could have burned were Red Army uniforms.   Hes a Russian-German dual citizen, part of the Russlanddeutsche minority who immigrated into Germany shortly after the fall of the Soviet Union. 
t1_dutrhut	0	*	But only if you drink water regularly
t1_ducqlbp	1	*	It wasn't a law, it was an Obama EO. It went through Congress and did not pass because not enough D votes could be gathered.
t1_duthbie	1	*	 Completely unenforceable. A mandate will never happen.  21000 new cases of measles in Europe is barely news worthy. Who cares? We've got bigger problems to solve then the fucking measles.
t1_dutyixq	1	*	He belongs in /r/iamatotalpieceofshit
t1_dui8e57	0	*	I agree with you that Facebook's walled garden is extremely dodgy, but this was in African countries without network neutrality. It also only offered one website, unlike Facefook claiming to offer free internet access, but actually offering only a very limited subset.
t1_dujn7x8	0	*	Yeah totally, this is moving faster than watergate.
t1_duafb74	1	*	It didn't work for millenia
t1_dun5udc	1	*	Live tv. You hear me Russia??? Hack Hillarys emails!  (He knew they already had)
t1_duzg09m	1	*	Soviets were very good in planning their future with the planned economy, 5 year plans  and all. Look where it got them. Planning leads to fragility
t1_duifua0	1	*	We are not quiet about it
t1_dup3asb	1	*	I moved from Boston to Los Angeles, partly because of the weather...it was 45 in LA the same day it was 75 in Boston. What the fuck.
t1_duon8o1	1	*	You mean China, Vietnam and bangladesh... or Taiwan some 40 years ago. Taiwanese products that are now more likely to litter your desk with high end electronics, your garage with bicycles and dedicated automotive electronics and parts or your kitchen with high end appliances.
t1_dux2oew	1	*	It's no different than the way the US treated Native Americans when we got here. It's insane that we can recognize how awful that was, yet in the same breath say that the Palestinians aren't being oppressed because the Israelis have a right to the land. 
t1_duliqeg	1	*	other source...  http://www.altro.co.il/newsletters/show/10680?key=78ff439c64a778a26cb69fe4e8355076&value=ac566ec4480155c282ab9e4bf108ec809c5dd89d:1261228  
t1_duuf552	1	*	The EEZ is 200 nautic miles from coast to open sea. The biggest batch of Squid is about 15 to 65 nautic miles from international waters to the coast. The average radar in a fishing ship can see up to 75 nautic miles.
t1_dupc3jy	1	*	Its funny how people forget or don't know about the invasion of Cyprus 44 years ago. 
t1_duge6q7	0	*	The majority of medical associations in the modern world side against circumcision.     
t1_dupiefn	0	*	Increasing GDP isnt as telling as GDP per capita. But lets be honest here, Germany is currently building itself as the biggest power in Europe and have multiple countries indebted to them, the fact that people can totally trust this country and love the fact that theyre building an incredible world power that will most likely go unchecked in the EU is kinda frightening 
t1_duukt1p	0	*	It's about time someone started slowing them down.  They think they can do whatever and whenever they want. Good for you Argentina for not backing down. 
t1_dur8wab	1	*	They are Canadian companies for tax purposes, I don't think the majority of them even employ any Canadians let alone have any Canadian values. It's why there's so many, lots claim Canadian because we have some of the best incentives for mining companies.
t1_dummhto	1	*	I hope these kids do the same, they are literally doing this to protect their lives.
t1_dupjwre	1	*	For bobsledding, you do need some leg power to prime up the sled and arm strength to hop in gracefully without jerking it in a way that ruins its momentum.
t1_dudrlfp	1	*	Or just racist disgusting Trump supporters. A few times times in Puerto Rico threads I've seen Trumpers make up fake stories about how they were personally helping in PR but the government there screwed everything up. Then when they were caught in their lies they deleted their posts.      That is so disgusting and inhumane. And these people have some sense of racial superiority?! If everyone was like them society would collapse.
t1_durfji0	1	*	2021, unless he wins reelection in which case 2025.  Republicans aren't going to impeach him, and even in the most favorable 2018 outcome, Democrats won't win 2/3rds of the seats in the Senate.
t1_dugs23l	1	*	That's insulting to mentally disabled troubled children. He's a retarded and insecure adult.
t1_duydgdg	1	*	I bet he has at least 4 Justin Bellybutton videos of himself making n-word jokes about the first people calling them 'snow c$#nks' or something like that. I mean just look how badly Justin's career was irreparably damaged when he sang a song about killing all the lonely 'n-ers'  out there.
t1_duckrey	1	*	It's a stamp
t1_duetyvc	0	*	Surprise level: 0
t1_dun8i3l	1	*	Looks like the crisis is polar opposites, I wonder why that is...
t1_duw61dd	0	*	Carbon capture? Humanity is moving faster than ever before. Tech included. That doesnt mean we can pull it off but we couldnt imagine the advances weve made even 20 years ago... idk this stuff puts a fear in me like literally nothing else.
t1_duhk5z6	1	*	Buy only <Insert_nation_here> policy is stupid.  It leads to stagnation in the market, and price inflation - look at Korea for example - probably the only country with megacorporations that literally make everything(samsung makes weapons btw).
t1_duh8dkj	1	*	Nah, it's well known Iran has a very very old fleet of planes due to sanctions. They should be getting some newer planes from Boeing and Airbus. Well maybe just Airbus with the way things are going.   
t1_duswkrf	1	*	People thought Obama was too apologetic after Bush. Wait till the next president is elected. 
t1_duszty0	1	*	Yes  History shows that this is never a good thing. 
t1_duaapa9	1	*	Trust me, US intelligence can listen in on them just fine. They just don't want China listening in along with them.
t1_duc1vpt	1	*	Farming is the driving force for North China soil moisture depletion; sucks because it seems to be the necessary evil as people gotta eat.  Food insecurity is a huge priority in China right now.  They (state owned ChemChina) acquired Syngenta to push corporate intensive farming, and i wouldnt be surprised to see GMO seed tech planted in Western China where farming is very difficult.
t1_duon5xs	1	*	Apparently he fired his lawyer for trying to get him a plea deal... and then quickly re-hired him. Interesting.
t1_duekkbh	1	*	Cuba's safe?

t1_dul79wy	1	*	> The Philippines supports Duterte. Constant, desperate digs by Internet socialists are irrelevant.  If this were actually true, then I'd support re-appointing someone to be the Governor-General of the Philippines. If you can't elect decent leaders (i.e. people that don't support the murder of their citizens nor willfully spreading HIV), someone should choose them for you. This coming from an American under that cunt Trump.

t1_durg7so	1	*	Reminds me of the Soviets plans in ww2 to send prisoners to the front to draw sniper fire so the army could locate and kill the enemy. 
t1_dutoz1a	1	*	Meth labs are pretty rare here in the UK tbh.

t1_duynjq0	1	*	Because no-one can do two things simultaneously? 
t1_dugakj0	0	*	His version of cooperation is the US doing what he says.
t1_duih65k	1	*	The US is bad for a *western* country, but still doesn't hold a candle to what the likes of Iran, Russia, China etc get up to domestically.  Human rights is generally understood to refer to how a country treats its *own* citizens. 
t1_duc8i3d	1	*	From their accents
t1_durm1m9	0	*	Welcome to reddit. Where ancedotal evidence is the #2 comment on a thread about climate change. Every. Single. Time.

t1_dupze8m	1	*	>You can't justify that, so you have to deny it.  >You can justify Stalin's purges and deportations, you can justify Mao and the great leap forward.  Lmao. Very typical rhetoric from leftists, Germans and Jews. Talk to a Ukranian or Taiwanese and see if they agree with you.
t1_durhix5	1	*	> repeating they propaganda they were feed  The unintentional irony of this statement is breathtaking.
t1_dufkxjx	0	*	If you have time, wouldn't somekinda water+sugar mixture heated to boiling be the best bet? Sugar will make boiling point higher than just plain water, and since the syrup will be sticky it will stick to the attacker. Unlike water or oil.

t1_dumjzxa	0	*	Anything that halts the means of production will be shut down for sure. 
t1_duixd1s	1	*	We've definitely had stagnant incomes, but U.K. millennials should be grateful that they can't really go bankrupt from medical debt.  I have a decent paying job and good health insurance, but I'm still a serious illness away from bankruptcy.  Murica!  However, I'm appalled at some of the U.K. salaries in this thread. We complain a lot about shit in the U.S., but those U.K. salaries are a lot lower. Is it better if you move elsewhere in Europe and work there?
t1_dusjika	1	*	I think it's pathetic how obvious it is you are a Russian troll.
t1_duquwa9	0	*	Mercenaries are Russia's way of keeping a conflict at arm's length. If a group of mercenaries gets obliterated, Russia isn't pressured to retaliate like it would if its own soldiers were hit.      Nobody wants American and Russian soldiers shooting at each other directly.
t1_dup6s7w	0	*	As a Dane, this is unwelcome.  I don't want the Danish PM to write Twitter messages on subjects which he probably have little understanding, for a population he isn't elected to represent. What on earth did he think he would accomplish with such a message on Twitter? To change US policies - he'd be a complete fool to think that? To improve Danish-US relations - again, is he a complete fool? But he was probably just virtue postering for a national Danish audience.
t1_duhsfyu	1	*	Of the 72 countries that Wikipedia Zero was operating in, 72 of them dont have access to US carriers.
t1_duj0q76	1	*	I mean... there was an American woman who put drain cleaner in her eyes and blinded herself because she 'identified as a blind person'... that's more fucked up than marrying a toaster.. at least a toaster will jump with with joy every 4-6 minutes.    (edited because I forgot some words. I R Dumb)
t1_dugbcmy	1	*	Grand Theft Auto: Vicar City
t1_dud2evj	1	*	It can't possibly be illegal to create fake twitter accounts and push out fake news to influence public opinion. My own Facebook feed is full of Americans saying stupid shit.    Unless the Russians literally hack our computer systems and manipulate votes, then this is a non issue. It's not just the conservatives that are easily influenced by fake news. 
t1_duol72r	1	*	What I'm hearing is that Congress is taking more action to combat Tide pod related incidents than school shootings.

t1_dustrnt	1	*	Her. 
t1_dupcogg	0	*	The German military is not in good states. It was just in the news that due to constant budget cuts and resulting lack of spare parts the entire German submarine fleet is non-operational. That's not good. Same issues with tanks. And I hope you understand that the military fulfills a very real and a very necessary mission of protecting the nation. So I wouldn't say Fuck military so easily. 
t1_dueloho	1	*	I think what they are trying to say is that the implications of the indictments are that they risk extradition if they travel to any countries friendly with the U.S. and many of the indicted folks are high level wealthy individuals that like to vacation and do business in such places..  Effectively, Mueller shrunk their world and made it more difficult for them to be useful to Putin. 
t1_dulkmrx	0	*	He should start developing nuclear weapons and threaten to nuke America, redditors would instantly fall in love head over heels with him, after all it worked for Kim Jong Un. 
t1_dup0ogg	0	*	Cool how that's literally not happening at all. 
t1_dun9u0y	1	*	Just like every other thing these troll farms did.  We believe the things we agree with and ignore the source while pointing at the other side laughing that they 'fell for' a Russian troll.
t1_duiygzu	0	*	That's pretty much what the anti-gay-marriage factions in the US fear as well:  that legalizing gay marriage will force everyone to get gay married.
t1_duhq7c2	1	*	yes, so you are now taking sides with the people that say snowballs are proof that the climate isn't changing.....
t1_dudgrjo	1	*	This is true, the orangutans are also very important in the regulation of a healthy jungle, as their droppings contain seeds which get distributed over a large area as they travel around.
t1_duwegaa	0	*	>interacted with people whom Trump would never even talk to.   I dunno about that, Trump seems fairly chummy with Erik Prince...
t1_dugccbc	0	*	Any ideas on the cost of that drug vs Cannabis oil? If it costs more then I guess we have a good answer as to why. Someone has to profit somewhere along the line. If not then Im amazed and it would be really cool.

t1_durr77r	1	*	There will still be plenty dealers when weed is legal, in my country there are.
t1_ducv6r3	0	*	I didn't need the Russians to sow the seeds of distrust. I'm still waiting for them to find those WMD's in Iraq, still waiting for the MSM to vet all sources, not just the one's they want to discredit and investigate government information rather than just regurgitate what they're told.   Until then I really don't care what Mueller says the Russians did. 
t1_duync4q	1	*	The pee tape? U0001f602U0001f602 you mean the fake document that 4chan made up to get CNN to report on? That included hentai and Obama sex dolls?
t1_dupei5z	0	*	easy to say fuck military when your ally(America) is essentially your defense force for free...congrats on that surplus though.
t1_duoevwt	0	*	Didn't Trump take healthcare away from millions? I also seem to recall he has been deporting thousands of immigrants, separating them from their homes and families. Now that I think about it, doesn't he regularly bomb hundreds of innocent civilians in the middle East?
t1_dudhvnj	1	*	Correct.

t1_dusmr63	1	*	So is America's

t1_duumkzs	1	*	Fun fact: When Xi Jinping was in India, a Government news channel reader read out his name as Eleven Jinping in news. Needless to say, she was fired after this goof up.

t1_dufs2lh	0	*	And those guys are gonna be in this very thread, commenting and trying to minimise, deflect or deny their existence.
t1_dukcckf	1	*	US government should make a site similar to twitter or reddit and require/validate your social security number when creating an account. It obviously wouldn't solve everything, but would at least be a space for discussion with other actual Americans 
t1_dupapah	1	*	BS. This is just optics for Indian-origin Canadians, no one in India cares if a visiting dignitary wears local cloths, we don't expect them to. We are more interested in FDI/Investments here, not some costume parties for respect/humility, we are not that low self-esteem.
t1_duyhrl6	1	*	All Western countries recognize the dictator as the legitimate leader after the coup, so its not only allowed its been normalized.
t1_duocqv7	0	*	But it's not CCW holder commiting mass shootings is it. There are many many many people who are CCW holders with no formal training but have been around guns since they were kids. I'm not against mandatory training for CCW necessaryily but it's not really relevant to the mass shooting problem. There are many cases of shootings that we're stopped by CCW holders they go unreported national (even locally).  From what I hear it's very hard to get a handgun in Australia and Japan.
t1_duurvwp	1	*	No.
t1_duq733r	1	*	I've been in DC six years now, it's a constant thing regardless. If you hear about it it's either a slow news day or they have a camera crew near the White House for something else. Like car chase stories a few years back. 
t1_dudipkb	1	*	Because impeachment is political and nothing will happen if there's no political will for it.
t1_duqhg8m	0	*	My guess is Mildronate.
t1_dukcdu6	1	*	At this point, it's legit like 99% of the time he opens his mouth he's saying a lie.
t1_duejp73	1	*	I also see it as good politics. North Korea is trying to argue that they are acting rationally and are willing to make a good-faith effort to decrease tensions. International support for increasing sanctions and military actions will lessen if North Korea looks better than we do.
t1_dutpe7g	1	*	Probably because it wasn't a terrorist attack. 
t1_dunruwh	1	*	Nationalism.  Nationalism is en vogue.  The leaders are not the problem, the leaders are a result of the problem.

t1_dutzycn	0	*	Which would be an act of war.  I would love for us to pound China into submission.
t1_dupdfkm	1	*	Yu-Gi-Oh was actually a documentary about life pre-video games, where all crimes revolve around a childrens cards game.
t1_dubktnw	0	*	Think of it as the old trope of the warmonger selling tanks to country a, heading to country b and going country a has tanks, it looks like they want to fight, you should get tanks (from me) too.. repeat until the country/ people of a country are at war.
t1_duqy0qn	0	*	Meanwhile, Bernie supporters everywhere continue to push for socialism in America.

t1_duv4alq	1	*	Just because something works as a pesticide for certain pests doesn't make it toxic to humans. Some bugs away from peppermint oil etc but it won't kill you
t1_duv0g9o	1	*	I think this generations ease of access to anonymity via the internet, and the harmless nature of trolling via misinformation is probably a bad thing in the long run. 
t1_dui9dsn	1	*	This should be top comment. Nobody should be taxed more, I think people should be paid a good living wage. Every company across the board would see their bottom line shrink as increased wages took up more of their revenue, but then employer, income, and corporate taxes could be decreased as more and more people didn't require the help of social services.  
t1_dupgpfk	0	*	Democrats are the cut spending, raise taxes party in the US, not the conservatives. Republicans are the cut taxes, raise spending (on the military!) party.
t1_dufmdmx	1	*	Branson is scum and perhaps the biggest cunt amongst the ruling class. He is systematically dismantling Britain's universal healthcare system and defamed Labour (who are trying to stop him) at the last election.    Elon Musk (Despite being a bullshiter), has made his wealth largely from paypal. Hardly immoral and a blight on society. 
t1_dufgc3f	1	*	Yeah but can they even do it and if they can't what options do they have?  Aren't they renowned for their xenophobia? Americans and French at least have a robust history of immigration and assimilation.

t1_dugggum	0	*	Fewer every day. They keep resigning.
t1_duiagrf	0	*	Meh.  It all re-enters the economy once it's spent, one way or another.  The important thing is to fight inequality and increase the velocity of money in the economy by taxing the rich who are sitting on large reserves. 
t1_duxl0n1	1	*	>They are literally doing this because of what happened in a country on the other side of the ocean that has nothing to do with Norway.  Not at all. That's not how we makes laws in Norway. This comes from a review of the current weapons law done in 2011.  It has nothing with current US shootings to do.

t1_duyltt0	1	*	Go away you Russian troll. 
t1_duna2tv	1	*	Well, if what they're saying is contrary to the Russian agenda then that does add some credibility imo. (Because I doubt they were being told to say something that only hurts the cause of their employers.) They also have more information than we have and we need all the info we can get, automatically disregarding it seems rash.   I'd consider the information plausible but not 100% certain.
t1_dujgjta	1	*	Too slow. The way you do it on an industrial scale is called a desalination plant.

t1_ducdkew	0	*	Except that meat production is the biggest greenhouse gas emitter and no one is talking about it
t1_duld3wv	1	*	My country also has religious studies class which students can attend, even though they are more specific about religion. However classes are entirely optional and can be substituted with social studies or third language study. So I assumed it was most likely similar kind of deal.
t1_dua5emw	1	*	I wish americans would rationally compare the list or % of gun massacres in European countrys with strictly regulated gun laws (where people can still supposedly obtain guns easily) compared to the US 
t1_dukxqii	1	*	It really should be named that because Trump will think this project was setup to honor him.  
t1_dui8gmn	0	*	It's not empty words, do your research. Gates and Buffet are two examples of the 1% who put their money where their mouth is. I'm sure they do more with their money than the average American does with their voting power

t1_duu1xvf	0	*	I think the way It was Introduced was a big mistake. I think weed should have never been a part of It. And they should have sealed people's records for small amount for hard drugs on their first arrest,then throw the book at them for the 2nd offense. Personally I would have no problem with the death penalty for large quantities of hard drugs. I don't think tax payers should be paying for dentures for meth heads when their teeth rot out.

t1_dunqry6	1	*	Ok I have no political education but to me it seems like its the result of neoliberalism. We live in a time of unprecedented wealth and prosperity but all the money stagnates at the top. The unfailing greed of the corporate elite is going to bring change one way or another, hopefully we the citizens will demand a fairer society that can work for every one but we seem to be going down the fascist route once again.

t1_duz5ub8	1	*	IMHO its different. The Taliban were in charge before. Re-legitimizing them as a political party only works if theyre going to stop blowing shit up.   FARC may be a model in this circumstance , but Santos has approval rates in the 30s going into this election, so its hard to say how long lasting this situation will really be.

t1_dus8n0q	1	*	You actually might not want that, having your data in another country makes it harder for law enforcement to get hold of you or your data. If I'm for instance are a Chinese citizen but have my data in the US the chinese government will have a hard time to find out about my anti ccp flyer on the other hand the in the US Disney might want to sue me for the movies I store on iCloud but to bad I'm in China and don't care.
t1_dunp1rw	0	*	As someone who doesn't live in the USA. Can you tell me why does everything have to boil down to liberal or conservative these days down there?   Why can't a good idea be a good idea, a bad idea simply a bad idea? Seems like any time I hear someone make a politician make a suggestion, the merits of said suggestion don't matter... It's all about which party that member is associated with.

t1_duefss4	0	*	That's because there isn't any. From the Dutch perspective this is a long ongoing affair for decades. With ocassional updates every few months or so.    The Guardian is basically just writing an interest piece on the topic and putting it in a global context. Which is fine, and it's probably something worth knowing about, but it's not breaking news or anything.  
t1_duxf0v1	1	*	Maybe it is and maybe is isnt.  It could also just be a PR/political stunt as they know it would be near impossible for the government to actually do.  Its very easy to say you are willing to forgo a raise when you know you dont actually have to follow through with it.

t1_duahabf	0	*	Oh, I definitely think Mike Pence is a huge asshole for a multitude of reasons. But not giving attention to people part of the leadership of a regime that has no contemporary parallel when it comes to crimes against humanity is not one of those reasons.  As much as I hate the guy, I think he did the right thing here. Rather than talking with the criminals, he talked with victims - the defectors.

t1_duk4lii	0	*	To clear something up for casual readers:  Yulia Tymoshenko ran against Victor Yanukovych in 2010 for President (Putin stooge who fled the country for Russia in 2014) and lost. Manafort helped Yanukovych win the election.   Soon after, she was blatantly tried and convicted by the pro-Russian government of Ukraine. The government then basically hired Skadden to issue a report saying See, all good here. The arrest and conviction was all above board, nothing to see here!

When people used to talk about someone being sent somewhere awful before Guantanamo Bay was a thing it was usually about being sent to a Russian Gulag (Soviet era forced labour camp) in Siberia.  I'd imagine the Russians have plenty of hell holes that make Guantanamo look like Disney land.

t1_dua86ha	0	*	I support having women as combat soldiers but *only if they can compete physically with the male soldiers*. One of the most important skills for a grunt is being able to carry heavy shit, and that includes a wounded comrade.   It isn't about genitals, it is about physical strength.
t1_duuzwty	1	*	And a human rights problem. 
t1_dus24tq	1	*	Thank you for mentioning the forgotten Yemen
t1_dudmtqm	1	*	Some I guess, but it will cost the government a hefty sum and not directly generate any new income on the country level.
t1_duqtrb9	0	*	Imagine the uproar if the Russian government funneled 60 times that to Donald Trump's election campaign through the NRA in a manner that, unlike this, violated campaign finance laws.  Oh wait no you don't have to imagine that.  You just have to wait.
t1_duuz2zl	1	*	If you think this man look at history, dictatorships always collapse and they collapse hard 
t1_dufxx2t	1	*	Five down votes???  Why was a factual statement down voted??
t1_dugvp05	1	*	Made of solid wood would be better
t1_dube463	1	*	Russia invaded and annexed 3 different territories in the past decade alone. Israel is very tame.
t1_dua4unb	0	*	It's literally diet, smoking and alcohol consumption, especially when those have a *direct* correlation to poverty in every single western nation. The poor tend to eat fast food and low quality meals, exercise less, and drink more. This isn't rocket science but is still a shame.
t1_dunc4ub	0	*	What is the Tai-Ban referring to?
t1_dutgzki	1	*	Except we really don't believe you? Literally every sentence sounds like bullshit. 
t1_duwgyba	0	*	Wasnt it Russia which alerted the Argentinian authorities on this? Source smells like bullshit.  Edit: if this was the opposite you would all blame the putinbots. What I say is true. 
t1_duem6z1	1	*	[Cowabunga!](http://www.brattleblog.brattlefilm.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/tmnt.jpg)
t1_dujmtsr	1	*	Youre not even trying Vladimir 
t1_duhnngs	1	*	> Right? It ain't robots enslaving humanity in the future. It's a few individuals who will use robots to screw the rest of humanity. This is just the beginning.  When you put it like that, I feel robots enslaving us doesn't seem half bad compared to people like Putin running the place.
t1_dunpvr5	0	*	It's his job to show up. A good leader wouldn't need cliff notes on how to feel human empathy.

t1_dup4ct9	1	*	*checks article*  Nah mental health issue. 
t1_dupzfyo	0	*	Maybe the Second Amendment people...I dunno. 
t1_dugpjjt	0	*	Fair enough.  Just know that a majority of the US cringes at his delusional narcissistic bullshit as hard as anyone else on the globe.
t1_duc8sr7	1	*	As long as the anime flows, they're a'aight.
t1_duixg41	0	*	Oh but it does make a difference. I am uncircumcised and for ages never understood jokes about cream and masturbation, as my skin moves up and down like a piston over my shaft, leaving no skin-on-skin friction, and therefore never a need for lube. Watching porn a circumcised penis looks like a wood stick being rubbed - what friction and pain !
t1_dugd0jz	0	*	Not an Obama fan... at all... but this isn't a fair comment. Every administration spies on each other, even allies.
t1_duv6ac5	0	*	Yup. I went snorkelling in Bali and kept getting hit by trash and plastic. It ruined the whole experience. The locals just don't care.  In contrast, when we were on an island off Cambodia every morning the locals would sweep the beach and remove the plastics/garbage that had washed up overnight from the mainland/other islands. This was a much more pleasant experience.
t1_duqc5av	1	*	Saudi arabia is another big player
t1_dumdi99	1	*	Minors don't have the right to just walk off a school campus.  
t1_dur4nig	1	*	Could be an attempt at a snowball effect?  Your boy talked Manafort, I'll give you one chance to do the same for the man pulling your strings otherwise it's treason.
t1_duucbf8	0	*	Ya, trolling is insulting another player's mom or teabagging them after team killing them. I didn't know trolling involved attempting to sabotage another country's elections now.
t1_dusauzu	0	*	You God damn youngsters! Move it or lose it, I'm not getting any younger!!
t1_duz97zp	1	*	Probably just means no. Chinese phrases such as  (I object) were already banned so I guess users resorted to a simple n as a code word, which is now banned too.
t1_duo6ag1	0	*	I do, it is not historically accurate to portray Jesus as a white guy, while he was obviously from near east with noticeably darker skin. Joan of Arc meanwhile, by modern standards was a 100% white, hateful, bigoted brit'ophobe of the extreme right wing, hellbent on wiping british off the face of the Earth. Fate has served her justice well, I'd say.  Then again, many people don't care much about historical accuracy unfortunately.
t1_dudidvq	1	*	Dont you love it when you fucking a bitch AND YOU FEEL YOUR BALLS SLAPPING AGAINST THAT PUSSY!!!! WOO LETS GO BEN!!
t1_dutiuru	0	*	I must just be stupid for asking, but if you are pro vaccination and you take your kids to get vaccinated, what's the problem? The ones who don't are the ones who have to deal with it.
t1_dunkkr8	0	*	The laws already are 18 a for a rifle and shotgun, 21 for a hand gun.  It's a matter of enforcing the laws already on the books.
t1_duhksj6	1	*	That people deny climate change* There fixed that for you.
t1_dui5prx	0	*	if 180k TC  in SF as a new grad is average then im getting really screwed where I work( SF finance-trading firm) with 3 years in the field...maybe I should be selling my body to tech firm.
t1_dud9e70	1	*	You don't have to wait for TD. Just read the comments in here from the victims of the Russian attack.
t1_dulx3ak	1	*	I dunno....that photo of the Ziploc baggie of prayers & hopes with Trump's stupid grin is pretty fucking dumb.
t1_dukkkfv	1	*	Promoting clean coal instead of green energy, for one. 
t1_duuci8x	1	*	She's the woman who sold the world, so yeah she wants to start benefiting from her payment ASAP. 
t1_duhq4p0	0	*	It's happening but it's slow. I take a sick sense of pleasure in watching the birth rate crash below replacement and no one being able to figure out why.
t1_dul9qnb	1	*	Or himself, that works for me.
t1_dun5rqi	1	*	Has happened, world kept turning.    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_City_Refinery_explosion

t1_duk4p5l	0	*	Or, if hundreds of doctors and mental healthcare professionals are to be believed, he just has dementia and exhibits all of the tell tale signs, and is incapable of defending his opinions or putting more than 5 seconds of thought into his statements. Neither option is great. 
t1_duj83hn	1	*	That's the problem with the comments here: no one saw the video, so no one knows the meaning. It's actually funny and not homophobic.
t1_dujlzvg	1	*	To add to that, I would also say collusion and meddling aren't the same thing either.  You can believe or disbelieve someone meddled in something without having any connection to them.
t1_duok36n	1	*	Thanks for the informative link
t1_dushtps	0	*	As a woman, I crossed that place off the list a long time ago.
t1_duimqkn	1	*	The coach claimed that that is why the claims are false. He is suspected of using an endurance drug similar to that which Sharapova was caught with. 
t1_duuszw7	1	*	Nope
t1_dudiqcg	1	*	If you break real laws, you get real indictments.
t1_duutcr8	1	*	One way of doing so is to move mining activities out of the ecosystem we live in.  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5129257/  http://www.mining.com/water-scarcity-pollution-to-take-shine-off-latin-american-mining-sector/   
t1_dujaumm	0	*	Crime actually went down in the neighbourhoods African migrants live in. Its a documented fact. They are also have lower crime rates than the general public.    All the rape and crime is fear mongering by racist Israelis, many of whom came from Eastern Europe and aren't familiar with Africans.   While paying these able bodied men to go home they are importing foreign workers from places like the Philipines. Does that make any sense?   
t1_dukikmk	0	*	This. They're everywhere. Its like someone set off a glitterbomb or confetti. Youtube, 4chan, facebook, twitter, even smaller forums and more esoteric sites. Its really aggitating.  
t1_dubcl0j	0	*	Maybe he's paying a bill with BTC, or sending money to someone.  Seriously, this idea that crypto is strictly a speculative market is what's causing all of the volatility. Why must it have been an investment?
t1_duq3fhe	0	*	i would like an ELI5 of how the fuck Trump is still in office. 
t1_duj8wtj	1	*	Pretty sure most of the demand comes from Vietnam.
t1_duwe7s1	0	*	I've been a part of an aid package. It's generally the contractors that take advantage. They are well paid and those they are aiding poor. The charities aid the poor as best they can.  To say the Aid charities are exploiting Africa is silly. It's the multinationals and the western nations that did for Africa.
t1_duqaw9j	1	*	Seriously, Saudi Arabia was one of Clinton's biggest campaign contributions, and they're all completely transparent about it too.  Sounds like a massive double standard.  Candidate we didn't like got elected, so we'll go after him for things we let candidate we like get away with with our explicit blessing.
t1_dunuird	1	*	In the same world where aljazeera, an isis sympathizer network, is on the top trending pages of reddit. 
t1_dubok5w	1	*	Derp. This is exactly the modus operandi of governmental destabilization. It's spy craft 101. What's terrifying is how many people don't realize this is the goal. Not the support of a party. The partisan news is the ones that are making it seem like the Russian and Chinese have a American political preference. 
t1_dutdksx	0	*	That was my initial reaction too when I read the headline but I feel like in this case its warranted 
t1_dufdvyb	1	*	>  Like all else, they (here in the USA) find no reason for advancement of knowledge through science  .....we provide more money to R&D than almost anyone else
t1_duv18gp	1	*	>  shows a major shift in political leadership from the Kirchner days.  No, it doesn't. Firing at fishing boats that illegally intrude your water is a total norm.  It's not like China is going to war with Argentina for some fishing boats.
t1_duiae76	1	*	xabBuy and sell much of Congressxbb You're definitely not wrong on that one but that says so much about your political system...
t1_dud356d	1	*	Or all he can find is crumbs....
t1_duhfo7j	0	*	Because we're in an age where you can pick and choose which facts you want to believe.
t1_duw99gm	1	*	It's fascinating how Navalny had become the real-life Gilderoy Lockhart for /r/worldnews.
t1_dub4ug8	1	*	Less cowards more survival odds. 
t1_duchzzz	1	*	Seriously. I read the title and thought, Wow, maybe theyre actually volunteers who truly want to be there!  Nope. North Koreas cheerleading team is exactly what I thought.
t1_duq8xuh	1	*	The [Russia investigation is actually moving amazingly fast, compared to past investigations.](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-russia-investigation-is-moving-really-freaking-fast/) 
t1_duhtmcw	0	*	Common misconception. Steroids also aid in the recovery process which allows one to train harder and more often. 
t1_dukc72q	1	*	Society is a strange thing. Us evolved monkeys are social creatures and for better or worse, monkey see, monkey do. Youd think wed develop more reliance on reason seeing as that is what pushes our species forward, but unfortunately thats not how it works. This whole situation has been a fascinating look at society. 
t1_due01qi	0	*	I just learned this the other day, but many Jews believe circumcision is a key covenant with God and indispensable.
t1_duox759	1	*	I think carrying out violence against citizens has no correlation with banning gun ownership. If the army wants  to fuck you up, the citizens having guns or not makes no difference. There's a reason that nearly all notable regime change in recent history happens due to military coups and not because of a citizen uprising. 
t1_duox751	1	*	It has been a European city since the early 1900s with a massive immigration from Europe, mainly Italians, not to mention native Americans were eradicated there way before this happened. There are German descendants and some communities, but it isn't all about nazis.
t1_dui8ljb	1	*	Nah I'd rather scream about race, gender, sexuality, religion or left/right wing politics. 
t1_dudc6th	0	*	Wait is this true?
t1_dur1ftg	0	*	International relations, Blocs and agreements will make even paradropping food for the hungry people into a severe violation of Venezuela's sovereignty.
t1_duo3dku	1	*	No no
t1_duq21ts	1	*	I'm glad we got you to hold us accountable.
t1_dupjv1y	1	*	EU, military, infrastructure, digitalisation, pensions, energy.
t1_duei67a	1	*	Cuba? Venezuela? Pakistan? Have they ever extradited someone to the US?
t1_dunjkbw	0	*	No point. Nothing short of a technological miracle will save us now.
t1_duhdmsa	0	*	I really hope you watched the rest of that documentary as well. The last episode was of a certain orange-faced con man who apparently exhorts his mindless cronies to buy American. Looking at your post history, aren't you of the same mindset? I wonder then why buying a German car would even occur to you?
t1_duy2bjd	0	*	For the love of god can America just trade for Pussy Riot in exchange for Paul Manafort, Sarah Huckabee Sanders and whatever Russia wants of Jared Kushner? I get the feeling everyone involved would be much happier. 
t1_duj4qfu	0	*	In Russia half the people actually do 
t1_duer5sm	1	*	My dad felt it in southern Devon. I was out walking and didn't notice anything though.
t1_duoswjp	0	*	None of you assholes are funny
t1_dusdcxx	1	*	These isn't a media story. This is something that's happening right now, for people that actually live on this Earth like you.  What's more concerning is the lack of empathy, and revolving every conversation around politics and money.
t1_duwt4ie	0	*	I think this pertains to British nationals who fly to Syria to fight on the side of terrorists. Might be even more of a deterrent to go, but I think many of these guys don't care about their children.  
t1_duf4512	1	*	I hope you are somewhere fighting the good fight for voting citizens.
t1_dulpgex	1	*	Lol no, he is that guy that Phillipines will look back to in 50+ years and be like why did we elect a murdering piece of shit?
t1_duu39tk	1	*	It does feel like some people are expecting to fight ww2 over again except with China playing the role previously occupied by Japan.
t1_duq928d	1	*	right now is it not the only claimed/assumed backed currency in the entire world???   what other form of currency has a backing??   i know china is about to back the yuan with oil...  the federal reserve fractional banking cartel might just loose this battle if they dont start bombing countries that dont play their game  what only like 4 countries dont use the fed banking cartel?... and in 2000 it was alot more
t1_duvr7y5	1	*	For me, I was very glad to hear how coating your liver in coffee helps to protect it from alcohol.  I was worried I went to crazy in my twenties, but I drank a lot of coffee as well.   And when I got around to getting all my blood work done, and an abdominal ultrasound, everything was fine.  I still drink some booze here and there, not every day anymore, and not nearl as much when I do, but I never forget to drink a cup or two of coffee each day.

t1_dut072k	0	*	Putin, Xi, Erdoan, Duterte and... TRUDEAU THE TERRIBLE
t1_dur9ky1	1	*	This is actually true, in both a direct and indirect sense. They also arrest people for being homeless.  You're under arrest for being poor!
t1_dujkkob	0	*	Yeah times really do change, 200 years back it was France who was the big bad wolf rather than Germany

t1_duj0zjk	1	*	When you have free speech even stupid questions will be raised. Does it bother you?
t1_duwla8c	0	*	Mostly fear mongering.   The amount of effort it takes to uproot and move is beyond most people's capabilities. 
t1_dui5923	1	*	They are the first country in the world to be downgraded from developed nation to developing nation.
t1_duq4u7x	0	*	Just to get the deal we know he had to have provided information that took the federal investigators higher up the food chain.
t1_duhv0ug	0	*	As well, after Valeant would buy a company and increase its drug price, it slashed R&D by ~90%; their CEO Pearson at the time saying that R&D was a waste of money, believing pharmaceutical companies should look to management, not scientists. What a terrible model for a health system, but that's the medical industrial complex.
t1_dugc5yj	1	*	But fish liked deep fried food too. 
t1_dusw5qa	1	*	Which of the other countries they have been allied with is exerting the pressure behind the scenes?

t1_durfs1a	0	*	except the govt presumably won't level their own country with artillary.
t1_dul6f4u	0	*	Hiring people to cry at funerals was common in Europe up to about a hundred years ago.
t1_duk71ir	1	*	You seem to think they wanted to stop that president. They really didn't. There is more money in war abroad then citizens getting shot in schools at home.
t1_dusci7z	1	*	Not from sea ice, friend. You need Greeland and Antarctica for that. 
t1_dujzz1a	1	*	I think he at least deserves the dignity of getting his own off-brand Elon Musk name.  Maybe something like: *Eli Must*
t1_duqbk4l	1	*	fuck russia  it should be dismantled as a country
t1_duwiea6	1	*	They should help everyone who's in need, from migrant to dedicated nazi and everything in between. Nobody has to starve in Germany.  It's a shame they had to go that far and exclude migrants completely but given the reason why they did it, it was the right choice.  Maybe it will kickstart a much needed discussion about what we can demand from those seeking our help, like not pushing an old grandma out of the way to grab free stuff before she does.
t1_dup6a15	0	*	So was Joan D'Arc. So historically accurate portrayal right there.
t1_dutn105	1	*	Yeah but these people never look at facts anyways so it's not like they're going to start now.
t1_duq24gn	1	*	He's threatening war. 
t1_dudrild	0	*	Musk doesn't want a monopoly, he wants competition. Competition fosters development.
t1_duntif8	1	*	I have been saying this lately too. You can just feel it right now.

t1_dutcy9n	1	*	right...unified under Kim and his totalitarian regime, which many more millions starving, executed and living in the 17th century. What's wrong with people on /worldnews?  
t1_dujveo2	0	*	First one then the other, obviously.  
t1_dufi1tl	0	*	Russia is a hostile foreign entity while Israel is an ally  Also pro Israel money is spent by Americans sympathetic to Israel (some dual Citizens, others not) while the other money is being spent by the Russian government.  Also it's covert  And worse of all it appears that the president may have colluded with a hostile foreign power in exchange for a bribe.
t1_ducum4r	1	*	'We' didn't do anything. The U.S. government did
t1_duw85yi	1	*	The stratosphere polar vortex took a warming event, dropped down to the troposphere which forced the troposphere polar vortex to split, it split to Europe and the west coast of the US.  This happens often, this has nothing to do with global warming.
t1_duqfkh3	1	*	I honestly dont get how Hillary and her Husband Bill get away with it, they use their charity to receive millions upon millions of dollars from foreign countries, then when they are elected suddenly those countries/pacs get all this funding etc. The FBI is a complete sham of an organisation, the democrats have proactively been eroding the constitution for years. 
t1_duo058n	0	*	The right in Denmark is probably a little to the left of the US Democratic party.
t1_duqgnlo	1	*	Its like the rights your parents give you.  You have a roof over your head, food on the table, and an education, now stfu or you will be beaten.
t1_duaosml	1	*	And do you think America's involvement is for the betterment of the situation of ordinary Syrians? No
t1_dudsvy6	1	*	Tons of lidar data is available for free online. Google search and you can find lots of sources. CloudCompare is an open source software that actually runs really well. It's a pretty lightweight program that has powerful tools.

t1_duic936	0	*	Not only has he defaced a historical artifact, but he embarrassed the entire country in the process.
t1_dujdf3a	1	*	Museum's largely rely on the reasonable action of their patrons.  There isn't nearly a single museum in the world you couldn't walk into and do large amounts of harm if you had ill intentions. Most paintings are not behind glass. 
t1_dunjlj8	1	*	So is it gonna be like what happens here in the US where those lobbyists are gonna shred this initiative up into nothing too consequential, or is the legit government actually for this movement?    If they do follow through, that would be great because they could be a model for many other Asian countries. But we gotta do something quick worldwide, I can't comprehend how much nondegradable plastic bags and bottles are going to be hidden out & buried around the world in the next 15 years..
t1_dut9czr	0	*	This is crazy. They bought ads and used marketing, just like everyone else. Candidates regularly trash each other and spend enormous amounts campaigning, Russia is just exploiting a system we created and embrace everyday. For some reason we don't mind being manipulated, as long as it isn't Russia.   *https://theintercept.com/2018/02/25/koch-brothers-trump-administration/
t1_duzct65	1	*	There have been 100% plastic free stores here in Melbourne for years also, at least 8-9 years from when I started noticing them.
t1_ducgc03	1	*	You act like capital has a nationality. Why in the world would capitalists care about transparency? Is it profitable? No. And if exploiting people for money in one country gets too difficult, they can just shop for a different country to put their capital in.
t1_durai4t	0	*	Yeah because starting a my suffering was worse than your suffering dick waving contest is the best way to bring about progress.  Japan did some fucked up shit to the Chinese and the Koreans (still are according to some accounts) but that has no bearing on the testimony of Hiroshima / Nagasaki survivors. 
t1_dunnq6k	1	*	And then they came for /u/MistroHen but there was no one left to speak for him.
t1_dupp8n3	1	*	Thats just what happens when you have a billion stupid people in the tech age.

t1_duruw60	0	*	What can an average, 9-5 working man do to help anyways?
t1_duk0fb4	1	*	The anti-orange project?
t1_duwskb5	1	*	Well, we get to see first hand how the amazing system that Earth climate is behaves when pushed out of balance. Will it result in negative feedback trying to get back to the previous state or in positive feedback accelerating the destabilization?
t1_duh01ur	0	*	Depends, does he have dirt on the Clintons?
t1_dulal0q	1	*	Chemtrails obviously.

t1_duh9w8i	1	*	Nah, it's getting so blatantly dirty that the reds have been flipping on Trump. When it comes out they'll have no choice but to sacrifice Orange the Hutt.
t1_dukhfyt	1	*	are you serious?  even pro-gamers take PEDs, anything competitive is rife with this stuff
t1_dua7tz7	1	*	Burst fire?  Only in America
t1_dugsy7w	0	*	Sounds like you may have seen it, but if not I'd check out the dirty money episode about him on netflix. I'm a young canadian who didn't know too much about him before, and it was pretty informative (albeit not surprising).
t1_dufb39u	1	*	He's losing his shit on Twitter tonight. He loves talking about fake news and people making shit up about him and then look  at his last tweet from tonight.  >General McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia and Crooked H, the DNC and the Dems. Remember the Dirty Dossier, Uranium, Speeches, Emails and the Podesta Company!   
t1_duddenz	1	*	Welcome to the club -_-
t1_duh41jp	0	*	The only thing that scares me more than Trumps presidency is the thought of a Pence presidency. Mike Pence is literal trash.
t1_dusmnks	1	*	Murdercrime
t1_duq6661	1	*	It's not a bug, it's a feature!
t1_dud53nd	0	*	This literally proves our point at how delusional you people are.
t1_dupl2n6	1	*	Naah, they did the financial crisis well domestically, but that is about everything that went well for Merkel.
t1_duyvsld	1	*	You have to click a continue to article button. I didn't.

t1_dutjhqg	1	*	They literally get to call up the consortium of village idiots and get instant responses!
t1_duebs75	1	*	> Russia is about 130x the size of Ohio.   147.37 times, but yeah.
t1_duiv3cv	1	*	Is avocado toast a reason too?
t1_dul5fts	1	*	A very stern warning.
t1_dustp6e	1	*	Butwhatabout...  Poor attempt.  2/10
t1_ducl2i7	1	*	If tweets counted as votes this might actually matter...
t1_duneur5	1	*	You need to update your terminology. Its not global warming anymore. Climate change is a more accurate and more idiot-resistant term. It's harder for morons to cry but it's so cold today, global warming isn't real! If you refer to it as climate change.
t1_dufkmoa	0	*	Reminds me of that scene in Mission Impossible II.  >TERRAIN TERRAIN PULL UP PULL UP
t1_durpn6k	1	*	Yeah, its a lost cause.
t1_dur46o2	0	*	Probably nothing. Us Norwegians like to think that we are morally superior, especially compared to non-Europeans.   The biggest newspaper in Norway (not sure if its VG or Dagbladet atm, but they're roughly the same) is tabloid shit btw. Mostly concerned about tv shows, various dumb shit gossip, diets, etc. Kind of like The Daily Mail in England I guess, but slightly less tabloid.
t1_dunkykm	1	*	Gaza used to be occupied by Egypt. They dont want it back and the Palestinians dont want to be annexed either. 
t1_duozvsl	1	*	I knew the Russian skiers were doping, but this is a bit excessive.
t1_duul7tj	1	*	>stupid  How so?
t1_duwnwl0	0	*	I think we need to remember the kind of people the UK has been placing on terrorist watchlists and using other anti-terror laws against.  Students, protestors, journalists, and other political dissidents.  I imagine knowing you can potentially have your children taken away if you don't behave will have a chilling effect on protestors, journalists, authors, and public speakers.
t1_duxpr64	1	*	Retarded religion cunts way of thinking  
t1_duh4fz6	1	*	Can you give some example for this? It could just be TD users.  But then again arent theyre compromised by Russian Trolls too
t1_dugd26i	1	*	I wonder what the difference between their cases is, and if the two families have been in contact. 
t1_dumzmkr	1	*	You actually think that shit stopped at your parents? Like four hours ago I had some guy telling me everything he knew about Switzerland's gun laws and everything he said was a total lie that couldn't be substantiated by any source, but he somehow 'knew' how they worked.  Go walk into /r/politics and breathe any opinion contrary to the circlejerk and you'll see no end to the shit people will believe as long as it benefits their side.

t1_dub9k2d	1	*	The dude is nuts, so yeah, its unfortunately real. A lazy web search turned up several other sources reporting the same thing. U0001f627
t1_dum9z7q	1	*	Well, it's not exactly wrong on a long enough timeline.
t1_dur2ltq	1	*	One election is what it took to transform USA from a republic to a presidential monarchy. Shit like this doesnt happen in the western monarchies, maybe Saudi but I doubt it. Im not american but this is probably what scares me the most about Trump. Do you think they will go quietly? Those assholes are dynastybuilding.
t1_duj4e3c	1	*	Oh god I hope mine can cook.
t1_duquux4	1	*	Still happy Clintons not prez. The country avoided the president I didnt vote for, in many cases because it did think twice before it voted.  Maybe next time youll give me a better option. 
t1_dult3pc	1	*	It will be truly groundbreaking
t1_duti0op	1	*	...I'm all for mandatory vaccinations, but logically wouldn't a vaccinated individual not be impacted by a non-vaccinated individual who contracts whatever disease the vaccination protected against?
t1_duv10or	1	*	lol guys just take a joke 
t1_dupi54w	0	*	Whats it like not understanding government economics to the point where you think the government taking your money and not spending it on anything is doing well?  Because that's what a government surplus is. It shouldn't be a goal. This is not household economics. I want my government to leverage our assets, not stock them as surplus.
t1_dujwfku	1	*	How many breads have you eaten in your life?
t1_duylkpd	1	*	FBI Investigations like this one have typically taken well over a year, sometimes multiple years, to complete.    Nobody expects that it will be over soon.
t1_duv241v	0	*	I'm mainly just worried that the next time I'm vacationing in Russia I might get in trouble for being labeled as a protester; or even worse, my rubber duckies get confiscated.
t1_dujm0wp	1	*	Over 50% of the House and 2/3 of the Senate
t1_dupzwri	1	*	Yes
t1_duxo2vf	1	*	that's a bad post
t1_dui920x	0	*	A lot of the Chinese who do the things you listed are from poor provinces and dont realise the gravity of actions like this, and China reacts by implementing tourist bans and special rules for Chinese to follow abroad.  If youre comparing an American to a poor rural family from Gansu then this is the largest false equivalency Ive seen in the comments thus far
t1_dukziks	1	*	This FBI? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AEElrAhB3Uc  If you haven't watched it all the way through, I suggest you do so.   If you can sit on reddit all day, then you can watch this. 
t1_duoezac	0	*	such good vetting, you don't even need to give them security clearance. its gonna be   very    secure
t1_dugcfck	1	*	It's gotta be mutual exchange. SK offered kpop and NK accepted. Now it's turn for NK to offer weed and SK to accept. I know that's illegal in SK, but kpop's illegal in NK too.
t1_duys937	1	*	It's NATO, so more European propaganda.
t1_duucuwb	0	*	Yes, the explanation could be anything. The correlation doesn't prove that coffee has health benefits. For example, the people who don't drink coffee might drink more alcohol.
t1_dujea7u	1	*	State enforced homosexuality
t1_dulzz71	1	*	It isnt. I know hundreds of real people being purged for their views. Our discourse is going to break down further. Not good.
t1_duhik2q	1	*	Peer pressure. Didn't want to feel left out.
t1_durpy7x	0	*	I think the likely party to ignore this is Turkey, not Assad.
t1_dudhb8m	1	*	Not THAT bad. They are still subjected to the usual civilian institutions.
t1_dunlxxd	0	*	I thought you meant that the Japanese fishermen are apex predators and was thinking that was a bit harsh. It's too early in the morning and I haven't had my coffee yet 
t1_duz0dx1	0	*	In this case it may be. She is involved with all the big shots in Russian politics. Who knows what went down in the past.
t1_duhui0l	1	*	Trump doesn't feel like he has anything to learn from others. Specially when it comes to banging
t1_duh9p2w	0	*	My first thought when I looked at the photo. Just the way the guys around her are all creepy looking and smiling 
t1_dubz31k	1	*	> People have been saying it for years, the next war won't be fought with guns, it will be fought with keyboards.  So what's with all the domestic shootings then - L literacy rates?
t1_duywf68	1	*	This isn't Islam, this is a totalitarian regime using religion as an excuse to exert power over women. The specific religion being abused is not particularly relevant.
t1_duop3pp	1	*	Bingo we have a fucking winner!
t1_duut2vz	0	*	That's because it's a live chart. You had to be there yesterday to see it 
t1_durj4ep	1	*	> Venezuela is in chaos, other countries can not interfere?   It's called colonialism and that's not kosher anymore.  Latin America has this chronic problem, they seem to welcome dictators like Maduro. Sometimes the military kicks them out, with varying success. It happened in Brazil in 1964, Chile in 1973, Argentina in 1976. All of those deposed presidents had economic policies that closely match the Bolivarian Socialism of Venezuela.  
t1_durs93m	1	*	That's not that bad.
t1_dufpzl2	0	*	Wow so you actually, really do know him: and not in the figurative sense, either ; )  But does he really eat actual kangaroo meat? And did he really say the hunter deserved it? Or was that just figurative? 
t1_duqw04a	0	*	Like what exactly? Laws that say Elected Officials family members arent allowed to talk to foreign leaders?
t1_duji490	0	*	Umm we don't get to do that..
t1_duhcawp	0	*	nah, I'm cool not violating the constitution 
t1_dub2usq	1	*	Well a sweet as naval base, a good ally in the region, destabilizing Turkish / Iraqi relationships with the US, gaining extra allies from failed US policy, and of course rebuilding an oil / gas / natural ore / phosphate industries are all beneficial reasons.    It could be said that the naval base was a large motivator, the ally second, and the money from this is both a repayment plan for resources provided alongside securing a business relationship. 
t1_duljcrt	0	*	>Sobor had reportedly confessed to abducting and raping the child and killing her afterwards with a machete belonging to Lohar. The victims naked body and severed head were recovered from a tea garden.  They got what they deserved. I really hope they died with a lot of pain. 
t1_dursqu7	0	*	There are sanctions in place on the DPRK, enforcing those sanctions is legal.  Who is going to do anything about it? The USN has the second largest air force in the world after the USAF.
t1_dupodyj	1	*	Thank you so much for speaking sense, when I saw this headline I almost did a spit take.  Basic economic and financial knowledge apparently doesn't exist on Reddit.
t1_duozimj	1	*	The same way the US does almost anything it wants. Deep pockets and a huge, nuclear capable military.   Who is going to stand up to either?
t1_duozimz	1	*	i highly doubt 45 even has one..  the fact that he needed a note to tell him to sympathize to a group of grieving people says it all..
t1_dusrbpb	0	*	here's the thing: you can be anti-Hitler and _also_ anti-Stalin. in fact, back in the day, before it got bumraped by an orange clown, this was kind of America's USP.
t1_duqrbu9	1	*	I bet its than Ben Ghazi fellow I keep hearing about!
t1_duuf4rn	1	*	Because Spain doesn't claim to exert the degree of control over its people that the Chinese do. The Chinese government can already blacklist people from leaving the country for bad behavior, so why aren't they in these cases?
t1_dulb8qj	1	*	Most of what I know about Islam and Judaism came from my Religious Education class in school.
t1_duue3pj	1	*	Pretty sure that these people already have autism, so it probably increased a while ago.
t1_dudbamb	1	*	Nobody actually cares about these Russians. Who they were working with/for in the US is all that matters. Once that info comes out, it's goodnight current government. 
t1_ducsy76	0	*	This is a great question. Also, how do you decide how much that changed the voting results. Do we need to look into other countries that might have been influencing or election or is it only Russia we don't like doing this?
t1_dua4lpl	0	*	Everyone does have fists. People still get punched in high school. What do you think would happen if every high schooler had a gun? Probably fewer shooting sprees, but a LOT more random murders.
t1_dudzf86	1	*	What's crazy is that Valeant's stock has doubled since that show became available on Netflix. It's almost like people decided that greed is good and wanted to get in on that overpriced pharmaceutical action.  That's probably not the response the show was hoping for.
t1_dung2ct	0	*	> I wonder what drove it  The end of the cold war, the cold war was a war for the hearts and minds of the world so the world power needed to appear like they were trying to improve people's lives and their wellbeing, now we are in a monopolar world so they can simply do whatever they want cause we don't have any alternative, so they are abusing their position
t1_duzfpwx	1	*	I78sa78ity   Alt+78 = N            Days later...            Number 78 banned, Soldier 78 banned.     
t1_duhm4c5	1	*	Irrelevant.   FTFY
t1_dujbe6o	1	*	Same here. Everything was so neat and tidy, I was always finding objects when I needed them. Really took the mystery out of life...
t1_dujbe6j	1	*	The video is satire/parody, it's not serious. And the gay thing is just a small part of it, and not the main focus, as the title clearly implies.
t1_dun8mns	1	*	Janitors will receive specops training so they will take care of the Mexican standoff with minimal casualties. Don't worry. 
t1_duexds9	1	*	Except all the flooding.
t1_dus5rrh	1	*	> So I'm not seeing the supposed need for a lecture on gun control when it failed in it's initial objective of making the country safer  Look up the rates of mass shootings before and after the ban. It makes sense that went down considering the gun regulation was crafted in response to a mass shooting, not bog standard crime.  > had the opposite effect  'Strayan here, cant help but notice my TV isn't constantly giving me news of the latest school/theatre/nightclub/church/whatever being shot up.
t1_duetvxc	0	*	Lol yep. I got banned for asking a question that wasn't even very critical of Trump.
t1_dupngd4	0	*	It's always fun to expand a comment sitting at -24 votes only to find that it's not a troll or something like that, but simply someone with an unpopular opinion.  It's not an I disagree button!
t1_duyngdg	0	*	Was it Target that put peeled oranges in a plastic container?
t1_dumzxvc	1	*	Same with Trump. Where's your outrage? 
t1_dugdvsq	0	*	That'd be terrible. Iran has great athletes in the sport. Not having Iran in the tournament would cause it to become even more lopsided towards the American and Russian/formier Soviet States. Maybe, Israel could stop bombing Iranian troops and negotiate some sort of ceasefire and mutual recognition treaty so fans of amateur wrestling can see all the athletes compete without having some lost do to political reasons.
t1_dunhkqy	0	*	In his testimony Mueller stated he was basing this assumption on what Colin Powell told him. Since the FBI has no overseas intelligence gathering operations, Mueller taking the National Security Advisor's word is not lying.  Unless you provide some sort of source that disputes this I'm going to call you misinformed or just extremely partisan. Not every political move is a conspiracy against Trump.
t1_duh4dw4	1	*	Yep. Lot's are. 
t1_dujirk3	1	*	I believe you missed r/conspiracy by a bit.
t1_dufswf2	1	*	I agree, but still does not change the fact that the Deripaska is a dirtbag but then so is Nuland.
t1_dul0jm0	1	*	If you want this boys hole... 
t1_du9xvmm	1	*	I have two relatives who are in law enforcement.  They find homeless people dead all the time.  Often, they cannot be identified or they cannot identify a next of kin.  
t1_dudpnjw	1	*	Any time you see a like button for Facebook, twitter or others, they know you've visited the website it was on.   Firefox + noscript plugin can selectively block it from happening.

t1_dumllpi	1	*	What a waste of time.
t1_dutbqk9	0	*	There is no tipping point I may be wrong but climate change is driven by processes and we can reverse those as we group together and figure it out. The amount of resources may seem insurmountable but we have seven billion people on this Earth and if they knew how our trash has destroyed every natural biome they would want to help. It's all a question of how long until corporations do something that kills all humans.
t1_dul4ttj	1	*	I feel like the irony would be lost on him, especially considering his brutal war on addicts despite his son and himself both being addicts themselves.
t1_duui74e	0	*	...and does he seriously expect people to believe that he hasn't consumed more cocaine than is good for him?
t1_dudgqrt	1	*	Because it's something Rosenstein pointed out, but that is irrelevant to the impact of the indictments.  They probably don't contain allegations that Trump is an idiot either - that wouldn't make such a claim false; it just means it's not part of these indictments.  I mean, do you think the investigation is _over_ or something?
t1_duoinvw	0	*	With several dozen splinter groups it's been impossible to keep track for years.  Even actual news magazines (offline, not that online bullshit or armchair analysts on reddit) have a hard time keeping up with it.  .
t1_dur4k3p	0	*	But what is Ivankas position???
t1_duarkcf	1	*	Lol as if this wasnt a sanctioned activity by the Chinese government that then burned their asset when it became apparent to the international community. 
t1_duyum4y	1	*	Sadly the first series will probably be on HBO, which means people will have to pirate it. 
t1_duhapb5	1	*	 Cuz all his peers are doing it?
t1_duog4ez	0	*	Mask or no mask? I think yes but avoid black face? It will not be the most accurate T'challa so that may ruin the cosplay. 
t1_dui7j98	1	*	> Bill Gates is one of the few rich people willing to admit what we all see is actually happening.  There are surprisingly many poor people who celebrate inequality.
t1_duer8hn	1	*	Same here - I was on Epsom Downs at the time.  And... nothing.
t1_dui11aj	0	*	To be fair, it's suggested guys tend to last longer if they're circumcised, so there's that. But it honestly seems a better idea to let them choose once they're older and can think for themselves as adults whether they want to or not.
t1_duoyjrb	0	*	When did he sell his country out to China? From what I can tell, he made one shitty joke about turning the Philippines into a Chinese province. If we're going to take such jokes seriously, a lot of Northern US States would be Canadian provinces by now.
t1_duiva9q	1	*	not gay as long as you say 'no homo'
t1_duy9xnb	1	*	aww
t1_due5cjq	0	*	The numbers and circumstances do matter. Where the aid workers demanding sex or where they seduced?   Ideally no aid worker should be having sex with the people they are there to aid, goes without saying. Any such action is questionable, at best. But aid workers are just as human as anyone else.
t1_dugbos5	1	*	They are migrants not people fleeing for their lives.   US would be a more accurate destination for letting every migrant in, right? History and all.
t1_dui24kk	0	*	Yes, because billionaires would be homeless if they had less that 500$M /s  Even if you taxed the poorest billionaire possible (net income of 1$B) at a rate of 99%, they would still have far more money than you will make in your entire lifetime (10$M).  I'm not advocating for a 99% tax rate for them, just higher than 50%. No human needs billions. They can survive of some measly hundreds of millions.
t1_dusjgyp	0	*	Dumbest statement. Immigration from Mexico actually reversed after Obama got tough on the border.  You're talking about 10 years ago. One's coming now are more Central Americans but there's steady movement both ways for Mexicans. About Equal both ways. Lot of relationships on both sides of border. The crime is bad but only severe in certain states where Narcos and Police crooks are out of control. 
t1_dup7abt	1	*	its almost like some people have never been rich, elite , or powerful.   its pretty ubiquitous. Ive had to come up with clever excuses of not joining people for coke. 
t1_duat8y1	1	*	Even the headline doesn't list his name.  It's not exactly a familiar topic.
t1_duiax57	1	*	Once you hit 3 mil in assets, 3.5% return per year gives you $105,000 per year in additional assets.    You can do literally... nothing... and make 105k per year once you have enough assets.    And you're going to pay a much lower tax rate than someone making 105 from salary.    While others have to bust ass to not make ends meet.   
t1_dubnsa5	0	*	Inexpensive conscript labor gets shit done.
t1_duyfjnl	1	*	There is no available mechanism for him to do so.

t1_duam4fx	1	*	> Turkey are secret ismalists,  Secret? I think they're pretty open these days about what they are.
t1_duwkgbs	1	*	> At this point it's unclear why Ireland doesn't bulge and just accept free money.  It's not free money. It will signal to every foreign corp that Ireland is no longer a low-tax haven. That's the big reason why these multinationals are bothering setting up their operations in Ireland. 
t1_duyczdp	0	*	I don't understand, what is the reason people need to have access to semi-automatic rifles?   Can you please tell me some of the reasons you think people should have access to such a thing.
t1_dufftb0	1	*	This. And just random post shares by anyone around the world, Americans, others, whoever. I wouldn't shake a finger at Facebook too hard for this. 
t1_dujleix	1	*	It is difficult for a man who has the top intelligence agencies in the world supplying him with all the information he could ever want to say I don't believe they interfered. If we were talking the average guy on the street, yeah, I can see your point. But we are not talking the average guy on the street. If anyone was in a position to know, it was him. He took the ignorance is bliss approach to boost his own ego.
t1_dubb4st	0	*	Nato was designed to stop Soviet imperialism and it worked. Now it still plays that part with Russia
t1_duyr7z2	1	*	Hmmmm. It's almost like he had insider information on SOMETHING. Man I really wonder what that could have been...
t1_dujhyui	1	*	Heart attack because he was poisoned.  Let's start conspiracy theory competition!
t1_duos6x4	1	*	It doesnt work that way, because the Russian ambassador called in the police, making it so that the Russian government has de facto revoked those protections, as the Russian ambassador is the legal representative of Russia in the country he is stationed. 
t1_dugntqg	0	*	If you use a lot of spray-on cleaning products maybe use a face mask. I don't think mopping the floor with soap-water is an issue, the article specifically says Regular use of cleaning sprays ... is the cause.
t1_duirdi1	0	*	Technically, chewing chewing gum isn't an offence. Selling them are. :l  Alcohol is sold normally, but not after 10pm at non-drinking areas(pubs, bars, clubs etc)  Marijuana is regarded as ill-drug usage, and this country is strict af full-on zero-drug stand on drug use.

t1_duvy5an	0	*	8 billion people  Sustainable living  Pick one 
t1_dus440x	1	*	Nah the Syrian government got caught using chemical weapons for like the 3rd or 4th time lat month. And France said they'd invade if Syria got caught doing it again. Also a bunch of russian mercenaries attacked a US firebase that was also a refinery. Its just no one really covered it at all in the US media, because of the Florida shootings and the winter olympics. Jack Shit is going to happen the media just playing catch up.

t1_duvx09j	0	*	I was talking to a childhood friend about Bitcoin and mentioned how bad it is for the environment, and he told me it's bad to make small amounts of money trading Bitcoin but worth the environmental destruction if you get rich off it. WTF is wrong with people?
t1_duk5kff	1	*	Disgusting. A lot of people here think it's a video game. Comments like I would pay to watch and other stupidities posted by (intellectually) twelve-year-olds from the basement of their mom. 
t1_duway5g	1	*	It should eat you alive, but here is some good news: http://e360.yale.edu/digest/industry-analysis-suggests-indias-demand-for-coal-will-decline-in-coming-decades
t1_dujq1k6	0	*	Still no sanctions either.
t1_dunon53	0	*	Less about his actions and more about his rhetoric. All news stories that go against him are fake. Media outlets he doesnt like are the enemy of the American people. Democrats are treasonous because they didnt applaud him enough during the State of the Union. Even if he wasnt totally serious is saying all that sort of stuff, its still shocking for the US President to say.
t1_dusiuam	1	*	[this is the only wall they for](http://imgur.com/sDCA8fY).

t1_dulezvr	1	*	I wish someone would hack the relevant database to see if China spends more on Se Asian despots or western politicians. Im guessing the despots are cheaper but who knows. Sadly the native people are getting screwed out of trillions on wealth under S China Sea.
t1_dujj3is	1	*	Vote in the midterms!  They're coming up in about 6 months, and will determine the makeup of Congress.
t1_dupim7x	1	*	UKraine agrees with you
t1_durpw46	1	*	Ceasefire when one side can break it whenever they want, because they did not guarantee it themselves, whilst the other side did and if they ever shoot back, even if the rebels are shelling them, they will be viewed as guilty of breaking the ceasefire. It's quite insane really. 
t1_dumoh1e	1	*	You shouldn't be getting downvoted. Where did all that concrete go? Tunnels or hospitals and infrastructure? Why can't supplies come through Egypt? 
t1_dumoh1k	1	*	Encouraging economic development in 3rd world countries is a great idea. Our government is so corrupt / inept what could we actually do? Just throwing money at problems rarely work? 
t1_duw80kj	1	*	He rides in on a motorcycle, combover gently blowing in the breeze; Grab the drug dealer by the pussy (hell go without a gun because hes so badass)  and then hit the links for his 5th round of the day. Drug problem solved. 
t1_dugpweg	1	*	If you don't see the pendulum swing the other way in the next couple of elections, then we're truly fucked.
t1_dumfp07	1	*	I think it has more to do with election rigging than actual voting.
t1_duxjkrc	0	*	Wow, just wow. JEEZ, WHOA. Wow. just wow..... Relax, there's nothing wrong with keeping historic items even if they are tied to a dark past, some might even argue those are the more important.

t1_dumn4xq	1	*	I don't mind, if teachers put down 2 pissed off kids first.  Which seems likely.  Lot more 'disgruntled' kids than teachers at schools.
t1_dus7h9p	0	*	Time for direct action. Had the election been conducted fairly, the US would have already addressed the situation and physically forced Russia to back down before it got to this stage. A President Clinton wouldnt get pushed around like Drumpf.
t1_dumwfhv	1	*	Gundams weren't developed until after the space colonies were established. Establishing those colonies will be much simpler after the space elevator is complete.
t1_dujh6oq	1	*	Because Putin grew up in sovjet russia, when actually nobody even pretended that the elections were real. He knows the russian people would not accept that again. So he smartly keeps some opposition to act as a sparring partner for him. However he never lets it get too strong, and if it does suicides happen.

t1_dugmcmn	1	*	Imagine if you had your left arm amputated at birth. You wouldn't remember it now and you'd probably have some whole rationale worked out for how you're a better person for it and it makes you unique. You would never have to deal with your left arm!  /s
t1_duot862	1	*	Only if one has the slightest bit of intuition 
t1_duprgu3	1	*	Did it though? One could argue if this is a result of an investment, or the result of decreased spending per capita. It's not like you can increase your population, and not increase what you spend per capita, and say it's the same.  I don't know if that is the case here, but it's not unlikely.

t1_dur2bo2	1	*	When exactly was America great?  Was it when you were expelling the real Americans from their land? Was it when you were propping up dictatorships world wide? Was it during the cold war when you nearly ended the world because of a dick measuring contest with Russia? Was it during the illegal and immoral invasion of Iraq?   Please do enlighten me.
t1_dub2suw	1	*	And then think of all the rednecks shooting everything that moves in fear of their guns when the amendment passes.
t1_dud6brm	1	*	Its as dumb as the democrats when they dressed as a Donald Duck. The last election had it all.
t1_duj5duv	0	*	Everyone is trying their best over here, unfortunately lots of people still ignoring the crises, taking advantage for profit as well as the very rich folk just taking the approach of using as much as they want coz when it runs out they will just buy bottled water.   Many businesses have already closed and are working offsite. My company has asked that anyone who can work remotely do so, and if its possible even work from a non-drought province.

t1_duxdber	1	*	Upvoted but would change the last sentence we don't think that it should be done to at this time the question regarding legalizing cannabis is not timely ie. Instead of hard no-> usual political answer.
t1_duwwboe	1	*	Thats hilarious. They know that the government cant legally lower their salaries, so they petition it for some risk-free publicity. Power move

t1_dur7scj	0	*	It's estimated that the last person that was alive during WW2 will die in the 2060s.  Please realize that there are still tens of thousands of people alive that have personally experienced WW1.  Hell the last person born in the **[19th century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_oldest_living_people)** only died last year.  With increasing life expectancy it's possible that the last WW1 survivor will only die in 2040s or so.
t1_duf379u	0	*	I was circumsized because it was recommended by to my parents by doctors, I don't feel mutilated at all
t1_dul5qcp	0	*	I remember secondary school religion in Ireland. That was the bit of time to panic do your maths homework due next class. By final year, even the teachers had given up all pretense and everyone just used it to study for exams. 
t1_duhk9wu	0	*	It's abuse of the insurance industry because they know most insured patients won't be affected as much ... except for more double digit insurance rate hikes. Classic bubble pushing as the seams.
t1_dudhldm	1	*	Nope, they actually are mercenaries (paid private military companies). It's a shame for Russian government to do these operations covertly: leads to many deaths of those soldiers they hire b/c of lack of coordination. Oil wars :-(
t1_duxj7zh	1	*	Yeah I kind of surmised that they don't really care about their stated reason as long as they can order the women around

t1_dur0jaw	1	*	When you catch yourself saying things like he pleaded guilty because he's not guilty, make yourself a cup of tea, sit down, and rethink your life. I know it's hard to admit you were conned by a bunch of particularly stupid crooks but you can still come back from being a Trump supporter...for now. Don't come crawling back after the whole house of cards collapses though. 
t1_dui4ocy	0	*	No no. This group uses a combination of stealth and assassination to perform research nobody else can do.
t1_dublygh	0	*	I agree with you, but Lebanon is in a precarious position being split between the christians and muslims, trying to keep things calm by preventing insults like that might be a good idea. 
t1_durjcdz	1	*	This is Russian army tradition. Russian military were typically conscripts, forced into battle. In the past, the officer carried a pistol to shoot any soldier that ran away to safety, not to shoot at the enemy.  And there is extreme hazing and brutality in the Russian army.  https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/gqdx44/full-v13n4   Russian army: Not like the American one. Brutalized and in poor conditions, they fight better than the other army when both armies are frozen and starving....

t1_duoruic	1	*	>If he put the same effort into studying as he did on cheating, he'd probably pass all his classes with straight A's  See, we already tried that, then the US spent the better part of a century convincing everyone that socialism was orders of magnitude worse than cheating.  So now we cheat just like the US instead. Difference is that the US knows that if they accuse everyone else of cheating enough, pointing out that they are cheating too won't be as effective.

t1_duv10av	1	*	> What am I missing  Everything apparently. You clearly **DO NOT** understand the situation at *ALL*, so you shouldn't be commenting at *ALL*.

t1_dui7314	0	*	I've heard of a few fun ones. From what I've heard, Brexit is incredibly likely to cause significant damage to the economy, and the best thing about it?  Apparently the government did no risk assessment whatsoever. 
t1_dumeq3e	0	*	Read the article.  Basically he's going to try to convince people not to vote, reducing the total number of votes for Putin, making him look less popular than he claims.  He's also instructed people to look for fraud at the polls, and throw any fraud they find into Putin's face, further discrediting his legitimacy as a leader.  He's trying to turn the Russian people against Putin.  I hope he succeeds. 
t1_duxhq2q	0	*	Slippery slope argument. They believe that giving women more freedom and ability to express themselves will lead to more sexual freedom and promiscuity. The US government has been making basically the same argument against homosexuals for decades.

We havent had this much snow (around 1,5m) since mid 90's, and the temperature swings are crazy. It is either -30 degrees celsius, or 0 and snowing. No middle ground. A normal winter  i use around 12m3 firewood to keep the heat. This year i have used almost 17. It is hard to not think about it... I constantly work against the forces of nature, so any difference is noticable in workload.

t1_dupwqqw	1	*	Not everyone who suffers assault or rape are *permanently* traumatised. People handle these things differently. Yes there is trauma, but the human brain has a great capacity to grow and recover with the correct support.
t1_duu1xet	1	*	(not a trump voter) Yes! We have already seen the prototype walls presented by several companies. That's all we'll ever see of it though. If we do, every dime will come from american pockets at the same time as they're losing their health care

Patents deny the means of production to the masses, meaning that a wealthy elite can afford to profit from drugs and those that have little money struggle to afford them.

These people depend on herd immunity to protect them. Even people who have taken and updated their vaccines are still at a slight risk of infection. Especially the elderly.  Too many innocent people would fall ill, through no fault of their own. I would rather avoid that.

t1_duq0x50	1	*	ahh see thats why they're also taking all his stuff too.
t1_durkpnp	1	*	All the insects that eat them are dead.
t1_dubp6d6	1	*	Well the GOP is slightly more controlled by Corporate influence and private interests, so they are a better bet if you want to influence our Politics. Either one would work though, they all answer to money.
t1_dusszwc	1	*	What's Trump going to do about it? Shit himself?
t1_dua4ahj	1	*	Yes. I, Japanese, think so and every others do. I even heard my dog said so.
t1_duuogq4	1	*	England the Iceland had a war over cod
t1_duedbtw	1	*	Is that British for had sex?
t1_duv6qz6	1	*	Ad campaign promoting a non-existing program probably.
t1_duza5mh	0	*	during the debate he asked russia to find the emails, which is astounding in it's own right, but i could have sworn he did tweet or mention the emails would be coming out before they were released.
t1_durjivk	1	*	Si vis pacem, para bellum
t1_duwb787	1	*	Jewish people
t1_duu8u9q	1	*	I hear you  Hint: I dont.
t1_dusiwge	1	*	They are, Russians and the Middle East specifically, still doing business with him despite the fact that he can't get a loan in the US to save his life. He'll just end up doing business with Vladdy Poo, the Saudis, and probably North Korea if he gets bounced.
t1_duzjgzl	1	*	**U.S.** Wah-PAW!!  **Europe** Pitted, so... pitted.
t1_dup7uvy	1	*	because in reality he is not a stable as it seems and he is pretty concerned with not allowing any opposition to live. also he is really arrogant and when somebody openly calls him a criminal in their political campaign he takes personal offense
t1_ducle6l	1	*	And get to the gun store! SALE ON AR-15's  this weekend!!!!!!!!
t1_dua5uj3	0	*	thomas jefferson would not be for disarming the public  the problem is we dont define what is armed - how much does a individual need to be armed - does an individual need a nuclear warhead?  a rifle or handgun is something every american is entitled to have for their home - but when we talk about automatic guns it gets hairy, and its more what a militia would have
t1_duqu2mt	1	*	no
t1_duh5zh6	1	*	Sooo...we're supposed to ignore official presidential statements?  Isn't someone saying this step 1 to declaring a coup?
t1_duryupa	1	*	Time for Russia and the US to join up, become buddy buddy, and let's all forget about the Steele Dossier and all of its leads being proven time and time again. Also let's have Mueller go on vacation. Nothing to see here. No one look into Rosneft.  But also Hillary Clinton, Ben Ghazi and his uranium pizza.  
t1_duecvy8	0	*	No.. Venezuela is a disaster of it's own making.
t1_duyaoig	0	*	Because they're accustomed to punishing anything that they personally don't like.   Freedom of expression is an important right. 
t1_durwsj5	1	*	And the casualties of bombings are solely women and children, since only those people get targeted by the government while in their Hospital and nursing beds; there is yet to be reported a militant casualty from urban bombing.  >Ayy, your name. You from r/scw
t1_dup0u55	1	*	Yea but the disposal cost adds up
t1_duuxhgp	1	*	Duterte sure doesnt appear to be as bad of an addict as you may think though.  Color in his face (possibly due to his location close to equator) He has cheeks on his face (lol) Hes capable of running a country (regardless of how shitty, hes still remains at the top there)  Source: former heroin addict (poor) (4 Years clean)   Lol digging that top reply tho for real. Why be a poor peasant? Its unjust in the eyes of our overlords. 
t1_dup9ump	0	*	They have been drugged they whole career. Suddenly going off suddenly would end in withdrawal symptoms. They are addicted.
t1_duvvfaq	0	*	Well at least when we have a acid rain cycle like Venus it won't be fucking freezing.

t1_duaxbr2	0	*	> Reddit Birthday  > February 15, 2018  Yup, saw that one coming.
t1_dumjj2q	0	*	While I don't agree with arming teachers, if you blindly look at the idea it's not the worst. One or two armed gunmen are probably less likely to entire a school going up against 15+ teachers who are also armed.   With that being said, it's a horrible idea and shows a lack of effort to finding a real solution to the problem. 
t1_duipg6e	1	*	You will mever have increased real wages when the supply of labour is unlimited. Immigration *has* to be limited, but Labour fails to realize this.
t1_dufobt9	1	*	Mildly interesting fact; The Prime Minister of Turkey back in 60s, survived a plane crash while he was visiting the UK for official matters.  A local couple found and brought him to their homes until he was picked up. 
t1_dui4rre	0	*	They don't *have* to grant the interview, do they?
t1_duusycw	0	*	Syrian here: due to the constant draft of men aged: 17-40 and the number of non-only child men that have fled the country; only a few men between those ages still remain in the cities, and since employers now arent risking hiring men due to military concerns, those remaining men are looking for *providers*. This is especially true in the city of Latakia 
t1_ducok3h	1	*	What you described was popularized by a book called Manufacturing Consent. It's a good read and I would also recommend reading what the author (Noam Chomsky) has to say about the current administration: http://bigthink.com/paul-ratner/noam-chomskys-surprising-take-on-the-russia-scandal
t1_dul7l1v	0	*	Can somebody explain to me, like seriously, what kind of person in what state of mind would call the police because KFC is closed. It's so baffling to me! What's your deal? How do you logically reach the conclusion to call the police because you can't get cheap fried chicken? 
t1_dubgi6f	1	*	well, why are you here talking on reddit? Go do something productive then
t1_dumdjnu	1	*	It probably has something to do with them not wanting women to be educated as well. 
t1_duxfkb6	1	*	He's really more of a fascist in practice. Mussolini type fascist, not Nazi fascist, to be clear. 
t1_dulc59l	1	*	Correct, if you live in either one you should be looking for some border to jump.
t1_duofzkt	0	*	They done goofed. Paul Manafucked and Dicked Gates ain't gonna see the light of day if they don't squeal. 
t1_duqjatb	0	*	It's not only socialism, it's the fact that Venezuela became a banana republic... there are many reasons and factors why a country fails. 
t1_duu8bl4	1	*	> A lot of people (regardless of their political positions) were disappointed by him today on the Chinese social media.  Yeah but Chinese social media are censored so you won't see them.
t1_duhkgjx	1	*	Thats why you should be alarmed. The earth exists for billions of years and we managed to ruin it within a couple of hundred years .
t1_dun0m4v	1	*	This reality has turned to satire.
t1_duusae6	1	*	Exactly, you can keep cleaning it up every day but there is no proper waste management system so its just gonna end up back in the ocean again.
t1_duioz6q	0	*	Scapegoating the gays is a popular pastime in mother Russia.
t1_dus0kjg	0	*	Unfortunately, I have a feeling this memo will fly under many people's radar. The GOP knew this when they initially blocked it to ensure the Nunes memo circulated first. The whole memo fiasco is like 8 controversies old in Trump Time.  The GOP strategy is to prey on the public's short attention span and it has, sadly, worked out well for them so far. They just lie and by the time anyone can get sources to prove them wrong they have moved onto the next bullshit escapade. 
t1_dux83t9	0	*	It would need to be funded by every country involved
t1_duvbj2y	1	*	Probably not. The people in charge then were smart enough to thankfully get rid of all the nuke stuff before they gave it to the ANC. They're so corrupt they probably would've sold the tech to the highest bidder.
t1_duqvfep	1	*	Why exactly?  
t1_dulh3ea	1	*	We have a system too, have you seen CNN and Fox News?   The oddest thing happens when you watch those news networks. When you watch CNN the righteous truth is bestowed upon people and they become true patriots. When you watch Fox News you become a Russian shill who wants to destroy the nation in Putin's name. 
t1_dusyuk7	0	*	Lol get some electricity before you worry about dictators lol
t1_dudl8mh	0	*	A lot of purxe9pecha are really proud of the fact that we fought to end before being colonized.  
t1_dur24y7	1	*	I wish they'd just pay off 20k of mine
t1_duchuam	1	*	How's Istanbul?
t1_duux4sd	1	*	Those were probably Duterte family sales associates.
t1_duux4sy	1	*	Anyone the gangs and cartels take umbridge with*
t1_duhvzxm	1	*	That Zwally paper is not the be-all and end-all of Antarctic ice research. What is it about the methodology of that study that makes you prefer it to the other half-dozen papers that have been published on that topic in recent years? 
t1_dulwnou	1	*	If you don't need it, it's not doing you any good.  Been smoking for 8 years..i still smoke because i have nothing else to do...but i don't say it's not bad.
t1_duw0bwb	1	*	I like the sentiment but how do we stop this trend? It's mother nature at work here.
t1_duayqjm	1	*	**Calling Nigeria a warzone skewed the data.**   Nigeria is the largest nation in Africa, and while it is an overburdened and overpopulated dystopia with major economic dangers on the horizon, most of its citizens hardly live in a warzone. Boko Haram and delta rebels are relegated to the borders
t1_duz7eqe	0	*	I guess the US could take them and then offer them in exchange for Snowden?    /s
t1_dugg6gf	1	*	I heard a rumor that most cord cutters switch to not watching tv. Only a limited number pirate, and its not because breaking the law is fun, it's because they also need to eat food and pay rent and such.   Not according to Rogers, though.   I've never known as many people who just don't watch tv at all, as I do now. And the number keeps going up.
t1_dupw9uv	1	*	If they are smart then theyll probably put most of it in Dogecoin 
t1_dua9gua	0	*	If you are given two options, one benefits you and one lowers growth by up to 8% (gov report), and you choose the second option, it's not exactly a great move.
t1_duy5iov	0	*	Why are Japanese so stubborn about this issue? Why not just acknowledge it and let everyone forget?  This always pops up as fresh agenda because of Japanese refusal to handle it with some dignity.   The only reason I know about these Japanese rapes because of news like this.  Japan could have properly handled it decades ago and it would have been part of history. Now lot more people are aware of it because of stupidity of Japan. 
t1_dujotgf	1	*	Rather, if there was such a vast degree of meddling/collusion, why wasn't something done about it then? Really activates the almonds...
t1_duuggrk	0	*	It does prevent wolf attacks, however the jury is still out on dropbear attacks. 
t1_dutc78b	1	*	Let's hope you're right. There are scenarios where that might not be so. 
t1_duw4p7a	1	*	Had snow and single-digit temps in the Midwest this year. The end is near.
t1_dumlzwu	1	*	>there are millions of guns in the united states and we have no gun control whatsoever  Yeah and it will stay that way. If you don't like it you can either push for a constitutional amendment of GTFO.
t1_duufpr8	1	*	To say the least
t1_dus10lv	1	*	What?  Mistakenly thinking you won the lottery when you hadn't is a common occurrence among lottery winners?  I'd bet it happens more often with the lottery non-winners ... if I was a betting man.
t1_dudq9tx	1	*	BUT WHERE IS HIS DUE PROCESS???
t1_dud2uy5	1	*	just look at r/The_Donald  its got to be 90% bots 10% morons
t1_duszmzx	1	*	Edgy
t1_duhf1po	1	*	Trump is not involved in the decision making, he has left it all in the hands of the generals, which is why we have an escalation of the conflict.  Unfortunately, surgeons will cut, lawyers will argue and generals will fight.
t1_dulnnj5	1	*	Probably it's because leaders of those countries   a) do their job of guarding their borders, and  b) their leaders didn't quite literally invite unchecked migrants to come and then blindly encouraging more to come despite increasing ... challenges, as they say these days.
t1_duf5cqg	0	*	Ah yes. The infamous both sides are the same argument.  One side posts links from actual reputable sources--which you probably don't like because they don't suit your narrative. And the other shitposts and memes all day with disinformation.  If you are reading this and *really* think you can't tell the difference then you are part of the problem.
t1_duxywen	1	*	They may be safe, but if I was a member of an anti-establishemnt Russian punk act, the last place I'd be is Russia.
t1_dunnkmh	0	*	Ahh a moderate not screaming the repeated lines of an echo chamber, what a relief 
t1_dugp736	1	*	he doesn't even use the POTUS handle. it's his personal account where he spews his bullshit.
t1_dup2nkl	0	*	Very counterproductive i would say
t1_dujxio2	0	*	Are there any cops or politicians being arrested? I mean, they failed to do their job or even did the opposite of which would be required from them. But I didn't read anything in the article about them being put on trial? 
t1_dulw072	1	*	 > banning all Muslims  Not true.
t1_duhvcir	1	*	only about 300 cm bad
t1_dui630t	0	*	Women and Millennials might not make as much, but we can still make an impact with our dollars and where we choose to take our business. 
t1_due31uv	0	*	I don't think that logic holds much water. The intelligence they have would be damaging if the US got a hold of them. It would be Russia's best interest they never find their way to the U.S.
t1_dut3ghs	0	*	If he will become an emperor, will we have a new dynasty name like Jinping Dynasty?
t1_dulduzo	0	*	It's not rejected asylum seekers but actual criminals they are protesting against to deport. It's just plain stupid.

t1_duonrix	1	*	we lol okay comrad <3
t1_duiv8o7	1	*	Meanwhile the rich keep getting richer, yay. Almost everything you pointed ouy is happening in almost every developed country, the future is grim, I'm so scared, I don't want to live my life with someone else.
t1_dutxex3	0	*	You realise that the very first thing immigrants get when they arrive in Europe is a hit of just about every vaccine known to man, right?
t1_duoh46i	1	*	Better than fucked up country more fucked up now.
t1_dum2qij	1	*	The Philippino people elected him knowing he would do exactly what he has done. He cleaned up davao when he was mayor there, they all loved him. He did what he promised to do.  Wife is filo, all my relatives there support him too. It's only western media that portray him in such a bad light.
t1_duett92	0	*	... i just don't get why people that know nothing of the Korean conflict, try to use it to prattle on about how bad the US is... give me a break.  Signed- an actual Korean...
t1_dux5n1w	1	*	Not really, most of it is replacing coldwar era tech and aging platforms. For most countries, the new generation constitutes a force size reduction (because units are costlier). 
t1_duvwqu9	1	*	I think you are right on this one. 
t1_duxme9d	1	*	And how exactly do we convince Iran to start sending us all of their women? Iran doesn't even let them remove head scarves.

t1_duxuchr	0	*	So why would Europe descend to the hellish levels of American crime rates?   Also diversity is not the correct answer because Europe as a whole because we are for some reason talking about Europe as a in this context is a hell a lot more diverse than USA. 
t1_dujl7j0	1	*	Thanks for the clarification.

t1_dunvpwe	0	*	Yeah, I'm sure thousands of Americand have all of a sudden changed their minds now over what this guy said /s
t1_duhi858	1	*	I don't necessarily agree that he didn't confront Russia on any issue. He armed Ukrainians, he acts kinda hawkish towards Iran who is Russia's biggest ally in the region and hasn't been exactly Russia-friendly in Syria either.
t1_due4dbm	1	*	So nothing changed after the whole Valeant / Philibor scandal. Mike Pearson and Shkreli. 
t1_dugkyx2	1	*	They do.. It's that poison symbol.. But pine fresh scent makes people confuse cleaners with.....  trees..
t1_dupb1i2	0	*	Even better: making your exports competitive by sharing a currency with lower-productivity neighbors.
t1_duo6nc8	1	*	Yeah because Trump definitely didnt say terrorists should be executed with bullets dipped in pigs blood, their entire families murdered, and imprisoning journalists and political opponents...
t1_duj4xu4	1	*	Because theyre fucked in the head 
t1_duery1e	1	*	> It's also been much warmer in the past than it is now.   This argument never works because life adapts to it's slowly changing environment to be able to carry on as normal, but when temperatures change this fast they can't adapt fast enough to survive, so it being hotter before means nothing.
t1_dui5bps	0	*	Nothing vaguer than a fair share.

t1_duwcdt2	1	*	And yet they managed to have a budget surplus of 6.2bn.
t1_duqxhvd	0	*	Same way British Privateers who attacked Spanish ships had plausible deniability if caught.   Piracy was simply replaced with terrorism, and mercenaries only differ in that they are being paid to act, instead of acting on their own. (Although I'm sure in some cases Pirates were paid by governments to stir shit up intentionally too)
t1_dubm4nn	1	*	reddit ones are more likely to be left leaning liberal ones, whereas it seems conservative ones tend to go elsewhere. its quite interesting.

t1_dud1zwf	1	*	Im convinced youre retarded 
t1_duk6vqd	0	*	This is actually hilarious.  Trumps stingy policies have spurred private interests across the board to pick up where the government is leaving off.   This is exactly the ideal behind republican and libertarian policies and society is happily playing along out of *spite*.  HA!

t1_dumlopg	1	*	There is an inverse correlation between students being allowed to bring guns onto school property and school shootings.  Granted, they are likely fully unrelated and some other factor is driving it all, but it is an interesting case.  Kinda like how a decline in pirates is correlated with an increase in global warming.
t1_duibtzb	1	*	If he was so wise then he would start putting his money where his mouth is to help fellow Americans instead of giving it all away to foreigners. Otherwise he should keep his damn mouth shut.

t1_durmabo	0	*	I live in a very conservative city in the valley in California and our city council just passed the ban on all recreational sales. The biggest opponent against recreational sales was a 70 year old evangelical christian that believed pot would ruin and corrupt our precious youth. Now they just have to buy it illegally off the guy who buys it wholesale in Los Angeles, an hour away.   I just don't understand that grand ol' party logic! 
t1_dun53qs	0	*	I'd like to see how Coco handles this 
t1_dusio7r	1	*	It won't take that long. If Trump and the whole presidential line of succession keeled over tomorrow and the next elected person said they would enter the Paris agreement and bend over backwards for China and the UN all of the sudden the world would laud the U.S. again.

t1_dupbjcv	1	*	Its an easy statement to throw out into a public arena to distract from the real issues.  It seems at face value like there would be a connection between the two... which for the majority of the public is all they need to support it. However the evidence shows no connection at all.
t1_duukxgt	0	*	> This is terrible and most people in Slovakia do NOT care about it.  2 protests already planned, i wouldn't say don't care, but we aren't one of those nations who would protest nonstop, sadly. 
t1_duqqy4y	0	*	Did you know that the US funneled billions of dollars to the mujahideen through Pakistan? And then later funded the rebel groups directly, in cash, arms (including state of the art missiles), medical supplies, optics for night attacks, radios, rations, and training? What an exciting world we live in. Just trying to shed some light if you werent aware. 
t1_duvz86r	0	*	That's a really stupid idea.

t1_dus0q2m	0	*	Egyptology is pretty cool, Im in university studying as an archaeologist currently and have applied to go on a dig in Italy this summer, thats the history that Ive been reading about for ages and I love it. I want to get into maritime archaeology which is where a ton of stuff has yet to be discovered. Im glad my dad supports my decision and hasnt tried to talk me out of it.  
t1_dunbo58	1	*	No, youre not supposed to throw Quran in trash, only burn it or repair it. I guess they thought the same about the name of the prophet.

t1_dubug4e	1	*	Hmm I don't know...destabilizing the Middle East seems to be their fortxe9.
t1_duolqbm	1	*	Sadly, you are far from the only one who wants all guns taken away. Trouble with that is, you wind up with only criminals being armed. The worst criminals would be your own gov't, a police state. Disarming law abiding people is the worst of bad ideas.  The real world will either have armed societies or emasculated, disarmed ones. Would you feel better knowing that the strong rule without compunction?

It hasnt been done before so we dont know exactly how it would play out if this President tries.  My opinion is it would start near immediate impeachment hearings.
t1_dulg0xk	1	*	To be fair, not every school had to teach religion as an exam subject. Even the ones that did, it wasn't taken very seriously. 
t1_duhuba5	1	*	Because they pay off politicians to ignore the problem
t1_dup05a2	1	*	Conservatives never learn.
t1_duto340	1	*	How does religion have anything to do with this? The Bible says nothing about vaccinations or disease prevention. Actually do some research instead of assuming that all stupid people are religious.

t1_dukhb7x	1	*	In case anyone else, like me, has no frame of reference for what a hectare is I'll save you the google:  400 hectares is roughly the area inside a standard 400 meter track, times 357.  Or alternatively, according to Google, Central Park is about 341 hectares so Trump Forest would be a bit bigger than that.
t1_duw9iym	1	*	Too right! The ingnorant and impulsive take up arms. 
t1_duof5de	1	*	sounds like typical propaganda.  btw this info about troll farm is well known to every russian and was published in many media years ago. american officials should read russian newsfeeds more 
t1_dunies3	1	*	I too am impressed but it doesn't surprise me. The Russians have been experts at disinformation for decades.  I'm impressed how well they adapted it to a new medium. 
t1_dujovi1	0	*	Until those allies realize that Germany won't have their backs. Then the feeling is no longer mutual, the US is a powerful country but times change, the US could suffer a serious economic meltdown or collapse as a country. Then countries like Russia or China could fill the gap. Then the EU would be screwed
t1_dueol7l	1	*	Did you travel to Turkey, pretend to be a Turkish citizen, and open bank accounts under a false name in order to attack Erdogan? Did you pretend to be a U.S. citizen in a group of activists to help organize protests? Did the U.S. government provide you with funds for your attacks?
t1_dugr1ho	1	*	Correct!  That's the point.  Social mobility is bad for those at the top, which is why it must end.

t1_duz05fk	1	*	To be fair, I've seen Hot Springs Arkansas mineral water since the 70s in the greater NY area. https://www.mountainvalleyspring.com/   Freemasons built Hot Springs in the 1700s, arguably the first ''wild west'' city. People have been drinking that water a long time. Italians in NY have been drinking Pellagrino for many decades. 
t1_dunuzba	0	*	I live in Canada and I haven't seen McDonald's use foam since like the 80's, maybe early 90's. This news is shocking to me. [They used to put all of their burgers in foam boxes and coffee in foam cups.](https://imgur.com/a/9d4r3)

t1_duawwrd	1	*	Want something solved? Draw penis on it.
t1_dujir57	0	*	Exactly. I am convinced that at this point Trump could strangle a baby on live TV and his supporters would cheer and say it was a future Libtard baby and then if that failed they'd pull the whole well Obama allowed Sandy Hook and allowed 20 babies to die WHERE IS HIS CRITICISM?
t1_dulnmxk	0	*	It's more of an indictment of Tory policy and their baseless rhetoric that not working is the reason people are poor...and deserve it.

t1_durq83g	1	*	> This doesnt sound right at all. The quote We got our f**** a***s beat, Yankees made their point sounds either fake or somebody has taken an artistic brush to it. Im calling this bullshit  The translation is incorrect but I have no idea how to phrase it better. He didn't use Yankees for instance, and    could mean quite a few things. It could be they demonstrated what they're capable of or they made themselves visible.
t1_duttw4l	0	*	Nemtsov was politically dead since 2000. He was killed by Kadyrov. I was a personal matter. It was not approved by kremlin and Putin had a conflict with Kadyrov about this murder. Murders by Russian government are theoretically possible, but the chance that they will be politically motivated strives for zero. You need to fuck up some really serious shit to warrant such responce. Navalny is left to play in his personal sandbox and is periodically given new toys.
t1_dujb8qj	1	*	Polish PM didnt say anything about Holocaust. Did all of you think that 100% of jews are just victim during WWII? I dont know what is wrong with saying about jew crimes. I we want to learn history we must talk also about stuff like that.

If you're going to cite airstrikes of civilian places, please take into consideration the Hamas places it's rocket launchers in civilian locations.  If you're going to cite rock throwers as civilians, well, they are combatants using rocks.  If you have any other kind of proof, provide it please.

t1_durrmgt	0	*	Israel was fine with Assad in power, it offered Israel a peaceful border with Syria, and that's a very well known fact. Israel even wanted peace with that dictator in Syria, like the peace it has with Jordan and Egypt.  Israel has absolutely no need for conflict in Syria, it was in fact Arabs (no Israel) who decided they're done with their dictators in north Africa and Syria.  Stop spreading lies about Israel.

t1_dup4gio	0	*	I'm starting to get the feeling that Mueller is methodically escalating his indictments and charges trying to force Congress/Senate to do the right thing. That along with the amount of indictments he has thrown out there, the guilty pleas he has gotten, and the sheer amount of circumstantial evidence in the public domain, I figure he probably has enough to indict Trump but is holding off.
t1_duohovj	1	*	Obviously it was that Harlem Globetrotters match that brought help.
t1_duhov4h	1	*	It's certain that a stronger eruption causes a higher ash cloud column. But volcanic power is always measured in the amount of tephra/ash that was blown into the atmosphere by the eruption. I think this eruption would be a  VEI 3-5.

t1_duo6eoq	1	*	Thank you, 
t1_dusiro7	0	*	Wanna make a loose alliance, and later (right before we officially rebel) tie each state together in, say, a union? We'd have to come up with a name, though. I mean, it's a union of states on the continent of America, so maybe we should call it the American State Union or something. State Union of America? 
t1_dugxf2h	1	*	Trump has been talking about running for a couple decades.
t1_duchb2v	1	*	Well, I guess this is how Glorious Leader becomes Glorious World Leader.
t1_dunn3fv	1	*	I would say continual concentration of money at the top. When you control billions, it becomes easier to change the laws rather than change the companies. Deregulation has a place, but I have a feeling much of it is simply done to make more profit instead of being better for the public.
t1_duhx7y6	1	*	Oh no, this lady has a different opinion from me, therefore I must hurl curses and insults at her! Me big bad keyboard warrior!

t1_dugybzc	1	*	Lets put it this way.  China has hosted many Presidents.  All of them had the football.  
t1_dujhgx7	1	*	I'm also pretty surprised. In the article it says that Montana tech has a 2 strike policy before expulsion. At my university in the US they said they had zero tolerance policy on cheating but I never knew anyone who was caught so I'm not sure.   Don't think this is representative of US universities. Cheating is not considered acceptable here and I think most universities policies reflect this. 
t1_duazo0v	1	*	When you scratch elections entirely you are giving up points for people to hide behind. You need to keep people complacent, that would be much harder without elections.

t1_duh5ajm	1	*	Exactly, and we're getting really close to finally questioning if we need a President at all.   Trump has been the best example of how useless and counter productive the office has become. 
t1_dubctyn	1	*	Meh - it was either that or America was going to build the biggest pipeline ever through Syria. This sounds like a better outcome for the Syrian people to be honest.

t1_dut0ch8	1	*	I think it's interesting Chinese people in this thread keep saying they're disappointed. Not furious or anything, just let down. I' not sure if it's cultural, language barrier, or if living there has just made them feel so powerless that they can only feel disappointment from this.
t1_dusjyrp	0	*	What's the best toy ever for lil' Trump?

t1_duruloq	1	*	For the vast majority, weed, alcohol, tobacco, etc. are perfectly fine as they can balance life with usage.  My issue with legalization is this perception that its benign and non-addictive.  While it doesn't have physical toxicity or dependency like other drugs, there is plenty of room for self-destructive behavior as a result of its usage.

t1_duwh75f	0	*	A lot of us care but public perception is that people who try to stop industry are labelled destructive eco-terrorists who are after your job and thus your well-being.
t1_duhtgor	1	*	Is it a beta blocker? Because that would actually help. 
t1_dugks1a	0	*	Being a stripper doesn't help you get away with murder.
t1_duakccl	1	*	Read the article ffs.  It's one British bloke saying it. Not Japan.  This is my official fucktard nobody even read a few paragraphs of the article thread of the day. 
t1_duq99sh	1	*	From that to shooting in science classes.
t1_duhd1p7	1	*	Those commenters are using Wikipedia Zero
t1_duusxj1	1	*	The link uses Celsius tho :/
t1_dua8kt3	0	*	But saying they found Out via some secret online chat gives the story a dark an ominous tone. How else can they say Trump is evil without actually saying it?
t1_duceiog	1	*	It's entirely possible for normal people to emulate the behavior of bots.  A friend's father that I know on Facebook changed his entire page to be an embarrassingly cult-like in support of Trump, including changing his name to Deplorable ___.  He uses a tool intended to better keep in touch with family members to argue with them and troll people.  He is indistinguishable from an actual Russian bot.    He didn't come up with that behavior on his own, he saw it on social media and adopted it.
t1_dublz34	1	*	They're not always.  Creating divisiveness is a victory for them. 
t1_duue6vk	1	*	Excellent summary.
t1_duyj49f	0	*	Guarantees he already has information on it and just going farther back to corroborate it and get information on other informants to flip them and know who is/isn't lying about it.
t1_dupg8de	0	*	pretty sure Germany has a dope military, currently.
t1_duuzzkl	1	*	Thanks for articulating everything I wanted to say. People should understand how the PRC government works before making  interpretations, the office of President in many different countries are like apples and oranges.
t1_du9qacb	0	*	 Guess I'll die. xaf\\_()_/xaf
t1_dudeetf	1	*	Hmmm they already have some.  Last time I checked they are on test seven or eight.  I was living sk for several of them.
t1_dut0wy5	1	*	>  I guess we've failed at showing the populaces of China and Turkey the merits of democracy.  You guys abandoned China before 1949. The window to save China has been closed since a long time ago.
t1_dusrtp9	1	*	*anyway, here's Wonderwall*
t1_duv5jwj	1	*	THE problem with the Philippines is that the government give 0 fuck about the farmers and low earning people in the country.

t1_dutgnm6	1	*	Anglo-German master race?
t1_duwujrg	1	*	The UK has sentenced people to life for murder but let them out after 15 or so years before. Murderers not serving much of a sentence isnt uncommon sadly.
t1_duf717i	1	*	Yup. Him poking a despot on the internet did it.  
t1_dukef1l	1	*	Have fun fine getting that fine money from them.
t1_dumm0ck	0	*	Did you even read the article?  Because if you did there is no way you could legitimately think that.  
t1_duni069	1	*	The public transport in both cities is strong enough to move those people through the city though. 
t1_duni06d	1	*	> Why are we suddenly believing the people who have been feeding everyone lies up until now  If you read the article and not just the headline youd know this wasnt the case at all. 
t1_duj9z9w	1	*	I do find how Russia has sort gone from banning a lot of the Orthdoxy to basically using at a power tool 20 years later 
t1_duil4g4	0	*	Cost and corruption is the basic info I got when I was there about 9months ago.
t1_durwutz	0	*	So he's a member of a banned political group and he's said mean things on the internet (if he had threatened anyone, he would have been arrested for that instead). Wew.
t1_duyo4oj	1	*	I love the tweets from people saying no don't it's anti-american and then you click their name and voted for the guy. Like... what? You had it right three years ago!
t1_dunn797	0	*	The right to privacy is being eroded. Phone calls and letters are private, and there are protections against wire-tapping and mail fraud. But there is essentially no protection on electronic information, which let's be honest, is essentially all the information now. Look at the Equifax hack and the completely limp reaction to all sorts of private information about millions of Americans being leaked. 
t1_duo1g2g	1	*	True.
t1_duv6m9t	0	*	Ironic since youre probably be the ones escalating to a nuclear war by being the ones suggesting to do something about it  You honestly think everyone in China and India are the sole ones responsible for this? How brainwashed are you?
t1_duu2vg8	1	*	Agreed.
t1_duk5xzn	1	*	They'd just group people into households of twenty strangers, including one gay.  Its not so much homophobia as it is a desire to retain some personal space.
t1_duwi21f	0	*	Sorry, but that's your own fault. You should have known that diesel cars don't have a future.
t1_dubcczl	1	*	Make a comment saying that Russia should give Crimea back to Ukraine and Putin is a psychopath who should step down.
t1_duxfrzp	0	*	I believe this is just referring to 'top' secret, which is above secret.

t1_duevmvq	1	*	Edit: I totally misread that.  Nevermind.  
t1_ducu2a8	1	*	Probably because they are Russian... And the rest of them are just parroting 4channers. lol
t1_duxoqvr	1	*	While it makes some difference having a constitution doesnt actually protect the rights described in it. Our 4th amendment gets ignored by the government all day.   Hell even the first amendment means nothing when they dont want it to, just look at anyone what whistle blows on the government. 
t1_duml8fw	1	*	> We had Wakes here where you had loud songs and drink to see if the dead would wake up. This from a time of burying people alive.  LOLLLLL love it.   
t1_dunnntw	1	*	If Russian bots are pushing both sides then what is the actual problem? Assuming they cancel each other out, then there should be no issues. Russian bots can voice opinions but they can't vote, they can't show up at protests or rallies, and that is what actually matters.   Russia did not invent the systemic problems they are tweeting about. They didn't start the fire. Worry about the fire itself and not the guy fanning the flames from across the street. 
t1_duq6p4c	0	*	Icarus (Netflix documentary) makes the reason extremely clear. It's also a good watch.  In short, not only are they doping everyone but scientist/chemist are helping the athletes get by and IIRC there were bribes/tampering but I think I read that outside of the documentary.
t1_dug3gpi	0	*	I mean everyone just takes out a student loan for the tuition anyways. If they succeed and get a job with this high value degree, all it means is some money going out of their salary?
t1_dur1bc7	1	*	It's Becoming, if the system doesn't improve.
t1_duuxusc	1	*	Eh, where does it say you should not kill?
t1_dulk1tx	1	*	100% agree!
t1_dusqiyk	1	*	Pure hypocrisy. But what can we expect from a government that imprisons more of it's population than any other country in the world and permits it's police to operate like third-world death squads running about extrajudicially murdering people willy nilly.   
t1_dugqinl	0	*	Understand them? Yikes. 
t1_duyaohv	0	*	> This seems completely based on ideology, not in reaction to any real problem.  Isn't that the best way to do politics? Think in the long term about ideology and what you want for society, instead of reacting to news in the short term?
t1_dujkodr	0	*	It hasn't unfortunately. Can you imagine living 130 days without electricity? Some places without food or water? 
t1_dujriff	0	*	yeah click the link and read it
t1_dujwggp	1	*	Isnt this the point of /r/trumpcriticizestrump
t1_dun89y3	1	*	There is something inherently wrong with a country where school shootings are so commonplace and accepted that most don't even make the news, but a brief flash of a nipple on TV is such a huge controversy that it's still talked about a decade later.
t1_dubt67a	1	*	This makes me genuinely wonder if a Princess Mononoke type film with orangutans might change some minds.
t1_dud7es9	1	*	Typical 'whataboutism'. Keep that for t_d like you usually do.
t1_dugmffk	0	*	The news source has no creditability but check out the video on that page @2:55. This actual story has tell-tale signs of bullshit, but the IDF is not above this type of behaviour either.
t1_duphquf	0	*	France is in a much better position in terms of clean energy and emissions. France went the nuclear route. Germany shutdown its nuclear plants and went for renewables and ended up with a shit ton of coal fire and pollution.  I highly recommend the documentary Pandora's Promise if you haven't see it.
t1_duylyqh	1	*	Recently, I've been feeling that people just invoke Russian bots!, every time they see popular support for opposing views.
t1_duxpbfz	0	*	Do you really think the burning of a hijab would be accepted in Iran?
t1_duq9sv0	1	*	From what I remember, the original article said that Cheddar Man lacked a certain gene that causes modern Europeans to have light pigmentation. I'm no geneticist, but I think that would mean he could've been dark skinned, not that he was dark skinned.
t1_duj78wg	1	*	/r/rupaulsdragrace would be sooo excited
t1_duj78wk	1	*	Greatest democracy and all that.
t1_due28t2	1	*	Yeah, and make the exhaust throw flames.  Yeah, I know it is an electric car, but this is CheapCarX we are talking about. 
t1_dupgzuf	1	*	All in all, one of the best countries to live in.
t1_dua2fhv	0	*	It's funny how brexit voters have so much in common with trump fans
t1_dujhvfm	1	*	Remindme! June 4, 2018  I'd also like to know more.
t1_duibc27	1	*	> and just simply leave  And still be liable for federal taxes because of how the US tax system is set up.
t1_duw16ov	0	*	Is this when the real collapse starts, /u/NapAfternoon? Is that what people have been debating about on the forum?
t1_duxokny	1	*	The main threat to this species is nets and collisions with ships. The WWF suggests not eating seafood, and if you do make sure its MSC certified
t1_duyftr8	1	*	[Real reason she lost Wisconsin](https://still4hill.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/03-29-16-y-16.jpg)  Also, even if she won Wisconsin, Arizona, and Alaska she'd still have lost.  It's not like Wisconsin alone was the one state that'd have made the difference.
t1_dui5jy0	0	*	To be fair, I'm getting an extra $2k in my paycheck this year because of the taxes. So it's not $70 for everyone. That $2k is massive for my current situation.  Not saying you're wrong with the rest of it, just saying many middle class workers were very much benefited.
t1_duklenk	1	*	This is almost exactly what I heard Hannity say today, with the addition that Obama needs to be called in to testify under oath about not doing anything about the Russian meddling that did not happen.
t1_ducn1bh	1	*	...because it is breaking news. If they had a full article it would not be breaking news. I guess it is annoying because we want to know everything immediately but it is sort of like complaining about shoes not being broken in when you first get them...yeah, that's how it works. 
t1_dui4os8	0	*	What can they realistically do though other than enter by force? The myanmar government apparently want to expel them all.   Edit. Expel or kill them all. 
t1_dud9qqp	1	*	Yeah seriously. Imagine if the school offered Cruz a coffee. We all know coffee cures mental illness. He would've dropped those guns down and would volunteer his time and services to help at risk youth.
t1_duha0ot	1	*	Kind of a shame that it's only going to be Manafort who goes down.
t1_duhwr9u	1	*	Sampling ice cores and permafrost. The margin of error is large, but the current change in Arctic sea ice is so large it's outside of the margin of error.  
t1_dudtmsh	1	*	Everybody needs a dream, but you will soon wake up to a nightmare...
t1_duf0kno	1	*	Its does need a reset. All these amendments are just band aids on top of each other that are adding additional fucks to this already astronomic cluterfuck. 
t1_dumqzti	1	*	>Trump paradoxically gets dumber every day, even after he's reached the dumbest you could possibly be.  It's his superpower.
t1_duw79dh	1	*	I used to be CEO of ExxonMobil and now Im the Secretary or State! These figures look fine to me!
t1_duyimf2	0	*	I love the fanfic that comes with TDS. 
t1_dugfe3w	1	*	I wouldn't have any problem if the family of whoever she sniped were to just track her down and deal with her. We need to make sure that none of these people return - there simply isn't any point in us paying for them to be on probation - these are people who believe in stoning etc.
t1_dusjhej	1	*	All those American flags made in Mexico become super rare
t1_dusbrgc	1	*	> Blessed be His name...for the one thing of any worth that he did while PM.   Howard was an absolute piece of shit but I'll give him a lot of positive credit for the firearms ban.  
t1_duf4x5k	0	*	looks like /r/worldnews is going to be the dumpster for everything that doesn't survive the new whitelist over in /r/news
t1_duhnt52	0	*	Wait what good would it do to profile and point out that it's immigrants? Are they less British or something? Are you guys afraid this is going to be used to move on your civil rights?
t1_duffx8c	1	*	I don't know, it seems to me that I see a massive amount of articles that are critical of the current government published by the CBC
t1_duias6p	1	*	Why dont we reduce all taxes to zero, and we can all just pay voluntarily?  Rates need to be set so that the revenue is consistently applied and predictable.  Your argument is very poor.
t1_duz3rt3	1	*	Water thrown at 1:19.
t1_dugi7j9	1	*	Russia did this better. Compare Iraq war to Syria war. Both of them got the US and Russia the oil resources eventually. Russia didn't lose much in Syria while US lost a lot in Iraq.
t1_dujtbyo	1	*	Agreed, 100%. There is something wrong with our society's value system. Anyone from anywhere in the world can buy ads on Facebook to influence people's opinions... but if the Russians do it, they are up to no good?
t1_due1xvi	1	*	The law doesn't allow for drug price negotiations. So we basically have to pay what they say.
t1_dubown3	1	*	Its easier to shout you are a robot than to come up with a coherent response. Russian bot! is a weak attempt by the old and mentally weak to scare the younger generation with spooky Kremlin robots because Youre racist! is losing its power
t1_dumwp33	1	*	> For fuck's sake, what's wrong with the ~~US~~ Russia?  FTFY
t1_dukc8nk	1	*	Thanks for the daily reminder that I lack a single original thought or idea. Keeps me grounded 
t1_dub64vl	0	*	Just throwing this out there... Not everybody who is pro-gun on reddit is a bot. Don't just toss out the opinions of others because you convinced yourself that those beliefs are fake. That doesn't help anything and gives you an unrealistic view of the world.
t1_dutwd99	1	*	France is the most anti-vax country in the world, with 41% of the population mistrusting vaccines  https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/mistrust-of-vaccines-is-greatest-in-france/
t1_dui849n	1	*	Yeah, because the government is so great with money. Especially spending it.
t1_duhfhwb	1	*	Easy, Anonymous sources who would never speak to the press again if the press released their names. AKA how investigative journalism works.
t1_duti5i6	0	*	I don't know if it's still growing, but it has been active in the Netherlands as well. I don't hear much about it lately though. We have a bible belt and in that area polio has risen. 
t1_dul2wiw	0	*	Tbh I would have liked him even more if he just took Canadas garbage from the Ph already
t1_duch41t	1	*	Who cares? He speaks in English, that is the position of the US govt, any misstranslation is their problem. 
t1_dulwv2o	1	*	Precisely.  That guy was voted in and people liked his policies including his claims of eliminating drug related problems.
t1_dudzfye	0	*	Jews do it, they don't like Jews in the past nor lately. Been a series of new laws regarding Jews in Poland. I says it as I sees it. There is a pattern recently. 
t1_dumkzzj	0	*	What's kind of messed up, is that although accurate information from that time period is questionable, legend has it that the city of rome was built by one such kidnapping. 
t1_duu7oub	0	*	https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_War_(1859) The US won a bloodless war with the UK for the San Juan islands off of Washington state which was started over an American farmer shooting a pig belonging to a Brit.
t1_duc2fap	1	*	Castro used his to eliminate Malaria from Cuba
t1_duq5qzv	1	*	Go for it ;)
t1_duu8ico	0	*	Are you suggesting. The US is going it get into a pissing match with China over Argentinian waters?   Edit: it appears people really think the US is gonna swoop in and fight for Argentinas fisherman. 
t1_duabegp	1	*	No facts, just conjecture. You have no idea what will happen when Britain leaves, just admit it
t1_duwvdzo	1	*	The US government is run like the mob   Edit: US generals literally saying if you don't work with our diplomats, you will face our military that's the mafia. 
t1_duxb5t9	0	*	Argentina gave refuge to Nazis after WWII. I'm sure there's at least one place that would.
t1_dupswzl	1	*	In most situations the race of the actors still wouldn't be the most inaccurate points.  For biographical or historical situations where the race of the person effects the facts I understand, but for fictional characters I don't care.   A white guy playing MLK would just be fuckin stupid, just like a black guy playing Lincoln.
t1_duoswel	1	*	Gotta get untraceable money somehow.  Taking plans from the CIA handbook, eh? 
t1_dupfnkb	1	*	This is for real, real metal as fuck. 
t1_duia38z	1	*	De-capital globally.
t1_dujafqk	0	*	It's almost like hes saying  look what you made me do 
t1_duj6qys	1	*	Except shit like hygenie standards and lower worker protections is **exactly** what the Tories will do.   They had already had leaked papers suggesting they will be repealling alot of protections and allowing sub standard US chlorine washed chicken in. 
t1_dugbnb1	1	*	Advisor: Is it legal?  PalPutine: I will make it legal!
t1_dugbnb6	1	*	That sweeping is actually quite a bit of work, particularly given how long they have to do it, over all those ends, all those matches, all those days.
t1_duhmw1l	1	*	You mean like in the movie The Thing?
t1_durxfbu	0	*	If you are in the USA, your gov't will do everything to record what you would upload to Chinese Servers.   Instead of a curious gov't spying on you ... you have two of them now.
t1_dugydt1	1	*	No puppet
t1_duv1ecu	0	*	It could be solved if they let people arm themselves.
t1_dujlkmh	1	*	Turn off FOXNews and maybe your brain will grown back. 
t1_duw7q7i	0	*	You misspelled lose as loose, my friend. 
t1_dunyax4	1	*	Savages. I hope Pampers tell them to fuck off. 
t1_duaixqn	0	*	His voters do care. It just so happens that the scandals revolve around rather minuscule things that probably wouldn't be talked much about in larger countries. Combined with the fact that the police have been dragging this for way too long, the public became somewhat skeptical about it. But overall, corruption is something that people in Israel do care about.
t1_dulz766	1	*	Not in the secondary school I went to or any of the schools in my surrounding area !  
t1_duqif53	0	*	I am having a love affair with this ice cream sandwich!

t1_duk89km	1	*	Let's call it Trump's Folly
t1_dulkzgg	0	*	I was reading about this and thinking boy I hope he isn't replaced by someone crazy, and then I wondered if that's how the rest of the world feels about America every four years... 
t1_duyk78x	0	*	Well a muller is:  > a stone or other heavy weight used for grinding artists' pigments or other material on a slab.  Related to the french word for grind: moudre
t1_dukdbps	1	*	That's generally a really good tactic if you can pull it off. Total puppet master level stuff 
t1_dugscvp	0	*	Just a preface: I'm Australian, not American. But from what I saw of your electon from here, I don't think it's that everyone wanted trump, it's that they were voting not hillary.
t1_duvq9tr	1	*	We are still going to need infantry.
t1_dufrjfu	1	*	Theyre one of, if not the most popular turboprop planes in the world. That also means that a lot of those aircraft are operated in countries with less stringent training and safety standards. The aircraft itself is fine.
t1_dulhbsq	1	*	Good luck. My dad took two decades to realise his drinking was heavy, but then he turned it around and has been sober for about ten years now. Keep it up!
t1_duh14u4	1	*	The President does not rule the government?   The article directly states lawmakers and lists congressmen and senators - those people also have pretty important jobs and rule the government.   ...and undermining President Obama was the GOP's sole point of existence for 8 years. Idk where you've been.
t1_duedsw0	1	*	And that the FBI goofed on stopping the school shooter, which was bad but obviously a cover.
t1_duj6saj	0	*	After a couple of years you get fed up making risotto 
t1_dusv510	1	*	Both.  They feed off each other.  That's why it gets more and more ridiculous every day.
t1_duopf84	1	*	Oh shit it wasn't us this time!
t1_dugclxs	1	*	> I mean it's not like Israel is a nation of illegal immigrants  
t1_dupo8b7	0	*	They're pretty dedicated.  Even when a bunch of GOP congressmen got shot while playing baseball, they stuck to their guns.
t1_duyd5gj	1	*	I'm in space 
t1_dur8r3i	1	*	Dictator? He is not a dictator. He was elected. In curious though, why is the opposition boycotting the elections now? Surely if they had the majority like liberals claim they would easily win, if they lost it could be a clue that the election is rigged. So why boycott it?   Also isn't Maduro asking UN and other orgs to supervise the elections? Hardly seems like a dictatorship
t1_duyd5gf	1	*	They probably know exactly why, but think that it's not worth admitting the comfort women issue to get on better terms with South Korea.
t1_dua6bph	1	*	on that list....of 2018 occurrences? Even if it was 3 (just in 2018)...you're ok with that?
t1_dum75se	0	*	What are the applications in relation to this report?
t1_dujc0yy	0	*	Germany is the 9th largest military spender in the world. They're not relying on the US, they're pretty above world standards.  The US spends 14 times what Germany does to maintain imperialist hegemony, not because there's any threat that large.
t1_dufypt4	1	*	There is no need for that. Does anyone think the Russian millitary would just go and annex a territory without the explicit order from the top?
t1_dup83d6	1	*	Thank you Denmark. As an American, we truthfully need all the help we can get on gun control. I respect that your PM called Trump out in this issue. 
t1_dui5dox	1	*	They should invest in maritime defenses for their super yachts.
t1_duvp9wt	1	*	I was there last week and the beaches were still trashed.  Although I did go to Nusa Lembongan for a day which had much nicer and cleaner beaches.
t1_dulau9u	0	*	Even on the consumer level DHL fucks it up. Seller sends something 2 day shipping, DHL picks it up Monday morning, then absolutely nothing happens until Saturday, then they drop it off with the USPS on Sunday, and it gets delivered on Tuesday.
t1_duquq8c	1	*	I was just gonna say that xD
t1_dutxoxm	1	*	>If it's all civilian there, then why the government still can't take control of these areas?  It's almost as if...it's a war or something...and the crazy butcher assad isn't just randomly killing civilians for no reason!  In all seriousness, the Syrian government has avenues available for any civilians to leave, it is the terrorists that aren't allowing them to. 
t1_duyx3eh	1	*	> What is everybody ACTUALLY so upset about here?  Their candidate losing.  This is literally a tantrum.
t1_dutupy3	1	*	No but the rate of fuckwits coincidently matches those who chose not to have a vaccine
t1_duvnuhg	1	*	The issue I see is that Apple has difficulties getting out of a relatively narrow field of expertise. They are the largest company in the world but their revenues depends on a handful of products. This is indeed exceptionnal but sooner or later, conventionnal wisdom will set in.
t1_duhiw9a	1	*	It's Russia, they dope athletes by default. 
t1_dusfthm	1	*	Went on a 2 day jungle nature trek in northern Thailand *to appreciate the wildlife*, and on the river raft ride back to civilization our tour guide was using a slingshot to shoot birds. Luckily he missed them all but he was really trying hard. 
t1_dugbyen	0	*	Refugees.
t1_dur829s	1	*	Nice try senator
t1_duhmg53	1	*	We have not, but we have collected many paleoclimate proxy records that span thousands, even millions, of years and some of those records have extremely high temporal resolution.
t1_dum2f4j	1	*	Some parts of China calls funeral  white happy event, opposite of () red happy event aka wedding.   It's pretty common to throw a huge party to send off the deceased, but a stripper is too much for my taste.
t1_dud791x	1	*	Ahh, well, I guess we may as well have done nothing, then.  No sense in following due process or anything.... 
t1_dush1p9	0	*	 Most Americans are aware that America First is hate-speech no different than white power!  Ridiculous statement.  
t1_ducwe4i	1	*	Its not about volume of tweets they deliver. Its about retweets, pushing conversation, trending, and encouraging other to post similar things. Theres a reason there is a rush to post FIRST on things.  Memes are an actual thing. You seed them and they grow. Hell T_D literally calls the election the great meme war - yeah they are joking, but the reality is the Russians *actually arent joking*. 
t1_duyrxbo	0	*	Why you sucking Vladimir's dick tho? 
t1_duce7ux	0	*	Honest question, how did you get addicted and how did you knew?  I mean sometimes I drink like 2 liter a day, a few days in a row, but then I don't drink any for like months 
t1_dud1u4i	1	*	> There is a foreign actor trying to actively sabotage our democracy.  Don't forget, there are some domestic actors at work, too.

t1_duzbwog	1	*	https://youtu.be/wWZTTtE5_zQ
t1_duyyjoz	1	*	Thanks for this. 
t1_dutdm16	1	*	Dude, cheeseburgers cause abortions. It's true, the mainstream media just doesn't want you to know that. They distract you with all the vaccinations -- autism nonsense while feeding your wife cheeseburgers to kill more unborn babys. You need to update your thinking!
t1_duv2axi	1	*	That depends on the drug. They're not all the same.
t1_dug2lqe	0	*	Punishing them all sends the wrong message imo. 
t1_duvyxul	0	*	My favorite part was when [he fired the head of the agency in charge of the Dangerous Drugs Board](https://www.rappler.com/nation/170839-duterte-fires-ddb-benjamin-reyes-contradict-government), which was in charge of drug-related statistics, because he wouldn't falsify data to support Duterte's ridiculous claims.  >As a local politician once said, hoy, mas tarantado yung amin (hey, ours is a bigger asshole)  Lol, sino nagsabi nito?
t1_duikemp	1	*	Liberal journal that has been around for decades. 
t1_duplce3	1	*	If there only wasn't this nazi thing some years ago
t1_duo39il	1	*	You make a sandvich and everyone eats with their hands.
t1_duq3e4a	1	*	Y'all... you can't even type like an educated person.
t1_dugj5rr	1	*	Can't help but Remember Sully thanks to this comment. That was a damn good movie.
t1_dulp0dx	1	*	being corrupt doesnt sound like a too difficult job description.
t1_duphzc3	1	*	Haven't you heard? After centuries of mining, we have finally separated our fine country from oppressive European bedrock, and have now set sail for fairer seas.  The Caribbean doesn't know whats coming for it...
t1_dup5fk7	1	*	If I were to bet, I'd say the inclusion of the word 'Mexico' means the blame they lay will be racial. Or illuminati lizards I guess... whatever it is, you can bet there won't be any self reflection involved.
t1_dukpe0y	0	*	Guess you didn't hear about the indictments? You people don't get to pretend nothing happened anymore...
t1_dua6hrk	1	*	As a european im legit not sure if this is a cleverly disguised troll comment or legit.  Lol allow kids to being guns to school, you people can't be serious
t1_dunmqr3	1	*	Whoa buddy, that statement is putting a damper on the circlejerk, I'm going to have to ask you to leave.
t1_ducu65c	1	*	We're about halfway up the food chain.   these are like the catfish you find in the Great Lakes. 
t1_duq2mfy	1	*	Nice meme. 
t1_dufez65	0	*	To be fair, the equivalent to female genital mutilation would be to cut off a man's entire glans. Nonetheless any form of genital mutilation should be banned. When boys turn 18, they can decide for themselves and have the procedure performed by a trained doctor.
t1_dul62a3	0	*	Why would it eliminate it? You can be a scumbag who has HIV and ignore it (scumbag for ignoring it, not for having HIV). There's an entire community of gay (and maybe straight?) people who willfully try and get it so they don't have to keep worrying about it. They're called bug catchers I think? They scare the hell out of me.
t1_dujyxb5	1	*	Also, bankrupt it into the ground while exploiting it and makeing off with the cash
t1_ducs5kb	1	*	>  keep on with the completely disproven muh Russia conspiracy  [coMpleTeLY diSProVEn](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/16/russians-indicted-in-special-counsel-robert-muellers-probe.html)
t1_duooxjf	0	*	You don't even need propaganda when people can't be arsed to read past the headline. And then they wonder why their political climate is so fucked, 140 character long attention span isn't doing anyone any favours you know. 
t1_dufbv8b	0	*	This can be considered good advice on so many fronts. There's a few priests and entertainers who should've listened to this. 
t1_duz7fia	1	*	Yeah, but you have to pay to prey. 
t1_dutk1in	0	*	I would have thought that a /r/nongolfers would be pro-vaccination. Probably a secret teeist...
t1_dudut0k	0	*	Here in socialist europe, we also have this problem. Sometimes they jack the prices up from 3$ to 3.50$ ( Price for a box of 20 pills). 
t1_durdopf	1	*	Neither excuses the other.   If every country had to acknowledge their own atrocities everytime they honor their own dead, then no memorial service would ever get done. 
t1_duguqq1	1	*	In competition we dont belive. 
t1_duh56lu	0	*	* Dihydrogen Monoxide * Diooxide Gas * Carbon Monoxide Oxide * N2 * Natrium Chloride 
t1_dupeo3l	1	*	Hum this is a very bold statement. Why isn't Italy's economy as powerful as Germany's then?
t1_dur19na	0	*	Obama wire tapped Trump during his campaign and its ok with you because it was Obama. 
t1_duwmi4j	1	*	Completely agreed. After all, it worked so well for Zimbabwe. Who cares that it will destroy their economy, cause millions to starve, and inevitably require billions in food aid from non-horrible countries?   At least they will fight against racism. 
t1_duixx7n	0	*	TBH, it'll probably be good for Filipino infrastructure.  Not so much for human rights.
t1_duwm4jb	0	*	> there are barely enough staff to give bath to our old people that we throw in dying houses.  They are also burning out one after another, just like nurses. Basically falling like flies. Source: mother in law is working her ass off in this industry.
t1_duown2c	1	*	Konami ruined it didn't they
t1_dumnq49	1	*	Shit, in most of America it's a social, economic free for all anyways. Why not add the military element as well to make it complete? 
t1_dusgyre	1	*	Marijuana is legal there
t1_duyo1cr	1	*	But when it all finally falls through, the Republicans will probably push the Pee Tape, and diminish the collusion and money laundering.
t1_dud947v	1	*	Rooskies downvoted the fuck out of you.
t1_dupih7d	0	*	I can't think of a sport where doping would be more effective.  Sitting perfectly still for a long time is super hard. Doing so on the right drugs is super easy. 
t1_duq1egq	1	*	No. 
t1_duczsjr	0	*	LOL....YES!!!!! After a year they found 13 Russian Facebook trolls and everyone here is acting like they have the silver bullet to take down Trump. I must say that it seems pretty convenient that this drops on  the same day that the FBI is looking really bad after completely dropping the ball on Nikolas Cruz.
t1_dutbric	0	*	Well the guy who started it is a now-disgraced British doctor who's surname is a local town to me.  And he started it all over wanting to get his own version of MMR to be used instead.
t1_duc5870	1	*	> Prices won't go up as much  
t1_duhz66c	0	*	refugees have nothing to do with Brexit, Legal Immigrants do. Don't know why people think that you can just kick all of the immigrants out because of Brexit.
t1_duc6lan	1	*	Another benefit of trees if you live where I do in Florida you can get some dope homegrown fruits and nuts.
t1_duuzfys	1	*	I hope it was because of the diplomatic looking suitcases, theyre both shocking and offensive.
t1_duw7d1a	1	*	Well, i think the anomaly started over Korea two weeks ago. 
t1_duwlfj6	0	*	Hence why I left the states and moved to Quebec.
t1_duwldr4	0	*	Why would paying doctors more be a PR armageddon? I rather pay doctors than the fucking wastes of oxygen in sports and entertainment. So its ok that kim kardashian makes millions and millions not counting her business income as well as sports players, but doctors who work so hard to save others should not get paid?
t1_dutydmz	1	*	why can't we have a real conversation where we can give fake concerns a fair shake?!?
t1_dujj0vc	1	*	Cheat, lie, sleep, repeat.
t1_dud2vkw	1	*	It may seem funny until you realize that most of the world's economies are hitched to this country and the current shit show of an administration. That's like laughing about how bad the driver of the car is while you sit in the trailer attached to it.
t1_dufv200	0	*	You stupid fuck
t1_duss2ab	0	*	You're an idiot
t1_duv45ce	0	*	I mean, is it really reasonable to expect an old man who has the most important job in the country to put his life on the line in combat?  Edit: downvote me if you like, but you don't send somebody that important to the front lines. There's a reason generals don't lead their troops from the front lines. I don't like Erdogan, but it's common sense why he shouldn't be sent into combat himself
t1_dua7n0k	1	*	As in, to Russia  Not to say Israel loves Russia or anything, they just trade with them and don't fuck around much, which is as friendly as geopolitics gets
t1_duw3tos	1	*	Over here in lower mainland BC we got ~25cm of snow on Friday. It's almost all completely gone by yesterday afternoon, except of course the parking lot mountains.
t1_dum6gnw	0	*	All the boys/men were killed/burned alive. Funny how this fact is under reported.
t1_dur8khp	1	*	Same brah. Just so I can be shot by someone that doesnt care about guns being abolished and will still use them to his desire.
t1_dutdopi	1	*	It's a game of last man elected gets to stay. We got Trump :(
t1_duxmvy9	1	*	Woopski
t1_duhfz5v	1	*	great sub, thank you
t1_duhfz5d	1	*	I you want a buzz cut or short cut, youve got a choice: either go to a barber, or go to a hairdresser and pay $10 more.  The problem might lie in this $10 figure. Why do hairdressers charge more to do the same thing? Theyre not better at it
t1_duqfp48	1	*	If there's Doctors Without Borders then Oligarchs Without Borders is the only true capitalistic conclusion.
t1_duboipw	0	*	I get so tired of reading news that quotes Facebook comments or hot takes from twitter like theyre in any way indicative of public opinion. 
t1_dur25yi	0	*	Still the most charitable thing Bill has ever done is put his wife's name in the foundation's title.
t1_ducvb8t	1	*	Sounds similar to Adderall, too. 
t1_duqlbmk	0	*	No, to favor the pro Russia government of Ukraine at the time. It isnt really clear from this article, Ill give you that. 
t1_duqms3y	0	*	List the women you know well enough for them to tell you if they've been raped or sexually assaulted...I did that awhile back, and its more like 50% (here on the US west coast). One in 8 doesn't seem incredibly high to me at all.
t1_duhulku	1	*	For real??  That's outrageous. 
t1_dui0418	1	*	Polio what?
t1_duv0r8y	1	*	also they might have a pretty big drug problem too
t1_dulkyrz	1	*	But did she take you into the other room, or invite you to the after-party gang bang?  /s
t1_ducpuy3	1	*	No.  The election results still stand. 
t1_duoii7m	1	*	One???  I'm sure you'd do better than that.
t1_dupnqaz	1	*	He was not.  He was deputy president and became president because the then-president of ZA, Jacob Zuma, resigned last week.  Jacob Zuma was embroiled in all sorts of corruption allegations.
t1_duoxqxd	1	*	So all murderers should be in mental institutions, not prison? You have no idea what you're talking about. 
t1_duqjpt9	1	*	You have to ask yourself what kind of shit he told the feds and Mueller to get him to admit guilt.
t1_duam56d	1	*	It's an insanely transparent piece of propaganda. 
t1_duu9vpu	0	*	Not quite. No true local would take photos of the Space Needle
t1_dur4wrd	0	*	Would you say the same thing about Taliban, Iraqi army, etc? Any US soliders they killed were fair game?
t1_duydjc8	0	*	Think about it, if you just learned toddlers sleep walk, chances are the parents didn't know until his death.
t1_duczzb4	1	*	T_D
t1_dula9e0	1	*	The news is this is something rather unusual happening out in the world.
t1_dugqb8x	0	*	Yes and they have been used by multiple judges to pierce what his true motives are, in the sense of what hes really trying to achieve as the embodied executive branch.  Even SCOTUS has taken judicial notice of his tweets.  Under our system, the president **is** the executive branch. Everything else happening under the executive is his *delegated* power. So yeah anything he says is important in determining the objective of the executive since he **is** the executive.
t1_duqcfbe	1	*	[Putin was focused on keeping Clinton out, helping Trump was just a convenient way to do it](https://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/clinton-putin-226153)
t1_dukxp3q	0	*	Professional Troll = PTroll. The ?  I don't know which one is silent
t1_dupy9d0	0	*	Watch documentary called Icarus, its on Netflix. Is about the Russian doping scandal and how it was made public knowledge 
t1_ducfwu2	1	*	Let he who has never bought anything made in China be the first to cast a stone...
t1_duheebn	1	*	> we should focus on what can unite us  Democrats don't even want voter ID, so good luck with that
t1_dudti3l	1	*	You're posting on a website that isnt particularly active in removing fake news and bots either.. 
t1_duayarp	1	*	In Russia, they painted portraits of politicians with quotes they gave about fixing roads.   https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/19/russia-pothole-portraits-activists-banksy
t1_dufu1ip	0	*	Agree 100%. Just the other day I read about a guy who choked on a piece of steak and died. This is why I don't eat.
t1_duc88ix	0	*	Trees actually keep the water sucked up near the ground instead of letting it flow down, so more trees -> less droughts.
t1_dug2ihu	0	*	Yeah, they say opening up to American telcos is bad for the country, but I'd honestly love to do it just to watch Bell, Rogers and all their filthy progeny eat it.
t1_duca8bl	0	*	Regardless, isn't using mercenaries a war crime under the Geneva Convention?
t1_duq55wd	1	*	The difference is in the dissemination of this information. And the potential mishandling of classified information. I seem to recall a huge thing a while back regarding those two issues in particular.
t1_duga1nw	0	*	They're usually from Eritrea or Sudan, they walked through Egypt into Israel. Since then, Israel has built a fence on the southern border, and so less illegal immigrants have made their way through, however there are still a bunch of them living in Israel illegally.
t1_dukenim	0	*	People just assumed the Government would handle it.
t1_duph5vc	0	*	This is what a unified country looks like, Germany has been divided in the past.  I think that motivates a good portion of the population to work hard to achieve a common goal.
t1_duufbk6	1	*	For the very special irony. American troll factory writing about Russian troll factory.
t1_dujlrud	1	*	As a Christian, it is a very unsettling thing to have so many people within the same faith disregard nearly every aspect of it to justify pushing a political party.
t1_dug76sj	1	*	No verb conjugation or anything.
t1_duiu25b	0	*	Nothing wrong with gay men. But politicians use them as puppets to control non gays thoughts and speech. Gays want to be left the fuck alone not be a side show for an agenda. 
t1_dupvy20	1	*	Buy a new copier.
t1_dunu8oz	1	*	Canadian here. For pancakes and similar breakfasts (eggs and such) but not sandwiches/wraps. Other than that... I can't think of anything.
t1_duoepux	1	*	Teenagers do dumb shit. However, the need for common sense gun laws, based on actual research and statistical data, is something so obvious that even dumb teenagers get it.
t1_duqx05t	1	*	Those are balls
t1_duh0su7	1	*	Obama had a bigger mandate than your dude has. You'll find out in November what the will of the people is. 
t1_dur3029	0	*	No, during the second world war there would be times where the two allies would get into a shooting fight. The same is true during the war in Vietnam and Korea.  Where in WW2 it was a case of misidentification turning into a full-on aerial dogfight
t1_dutxbl3	1	*	People with autism can be very smart. People that don't vaccinate can't. No need to belittle a group of people to try to insult the real idiots. 
t1_duy2r66	1	*	Those suviving comfort women should be treat as POW before release by US force. Anyone here can find their interrogation report like the above link?
t1_due9dia	0	*	Case by case. The UK recently rejected US's request to extradite the Pentagon hacker dude.
t1_duracwa	1	*	Same, its ridiculous
t1_duxygfd	0	*	The difference is in the West it's typically preventing terrorist attacks, in China it's as likely to be preventing protests and dissent.
t1_duwf2oi	1	*	It's not an absolute right though. If I wanted to put up a swastika poster on your living room wall, my right to free speech would lose to your right to control your own home.  Meaning we don't really believe in *free* speech; we believe in *less limited* speech than has generally been the case across human history. Might seem a pedantic definition, but I feel it's a reality check worth having as this kind of language influences our thinking.
t1_duwoaib	0	*	Surely it would be for people convicted of terror offenses
t1_dug77e3	0	*	Not to start any conspiracies, but this is also roughly the amount that was recently hacked from the cryptocurrency exchange Bitgrail U0001f914
t1_dus8umt	1	*	Nah, Trumps counter-memo  Low rated President Obama fault. Should have told me I was employing crooks and Russian spies. Tried to frame me with fake news media. Covfefe
t1_dugou4l	0	*	I mean, some of us tried to not let him be our president.  We just got outvoted.  edit:  he won with votes people.  I don't care if they're electoral or popular.
t1_duauw2e	1	*	It's not even that, it's a single former British ambassador to Japan's opinion.
t1_duj02uo	0	*	Plot twist, you're smart
t1_duulatg	1	*	> The value of a shark is ridiculous - over its lifespan a single shark will literally generate millions of $ in tourism for the islands. Dead it is worth $200. That's obviously aside from its value to the ecosystem.  BUt it would be $200 to the Chinese fishermen against $0 to the Chinese fishermen.
t1_duuz4sq	1	*	Sounds like reddit to me!
t1_dunf5mv	1	*	But what exactly are they hacking? I wouldn't call them hackers nor trolls, I'd call them propaganda bots. I also wouldn't call the place where they do their work a troll farm, I'd call it a propoganda farm
t1_duqgr6l	1	*	Sure is a more useful way to spend their money than the 300 million dollars they recently spent renovating and building a garage for their parliament building.
t1_duzh747	1	*	Isnt that the way socialized healthcare works though? The doctors are part of a clog in this assembly line as well right? 
t1_dui3vtl	0	*	Reddit comments on China threads have convinced me that Americans come in three flavours: salty, savoury and school shootings.
t1_dup1vlr	1	*	Euromaiden was way before that, and so were the little green men. Don't so confidently mislead people.
t1_duh6cp6	1	*	funny that Russians decided electing him would be the easiest way to hurt America
t1_dumpsv9	1	*	Because terrorists care about the sea for their vacation time?  Im surprised the hamas government arent intentionally getting paid to collect the worlds garbage just to burn it right next to their opppsition.
t1_duwrq5p	1	*	>  And if everything goes as planned I am not even allowed to enter the city center with my car anymore. Great!  You can actually upgrade it but it's like EUR 3000. I guess it would be best to force the car producers to pay for the upgrade. Anyway, it was also pretty naive that you bought a Diesel when you were aware of the scandal.
t1_due7wbi	0	*	Cuba's nice. 
t1_dudsddr	0	*	Have you seen a cello in a case? You aren't using that as a weapon.
t1_durem3a	1	*	Pretty sure a bone test would reveal that these are not 'children'.
t1_dudot4y	1	*	Pretty sure your reaction is exactly what these people are hoping to achieve.
t1_duqczes	0	*	God he sounds like one of those shithead parents like if you don't do what I ask I'm gonna get *reeeeeeeeal angry.*  Next he'll count to 3, stopping at 2 and going back to my first sentence.
t1_duhso6f	1	*	Because Singapore is smaller than the size of NYC. You would have to actively try to be inefficient to actually become inefficient. Imagine if the US (or any first-world country for that matter) were reduced to only its highest GDP per capita areas. The metrics of that country would literally break all records instantaneously.
t1_duwfqr0	1	*	That all sounds about right. Last time i told true bali stories i got downvoted.   They have a long way to go. Education would be a good start. Also some of the tourist money could be spent on waste management.  Non existent waste management is a big problem all over asia and it worries me.
t1_dul2fxf	1	*	Also he is as bad as Hitler. Good thing he's so stupid.
t1_dugxpei	1	*	the topest, in fact.
t1_dudvb0m	1	*	It also highlights the absurdity of news articles these days. So sensationalised. Weasel words. Click bait titles. There's so little integrity in journalism these days. 
t1_dutokjj	1	*	Just because they die doesn't mean they don't live with lifelong health issues after measles. It can leave children permanently disabled by damaging the brain or cause pneumonia and damage the lungs.
t1_duyewmk	1	*	They don't have enough manpower in field for that focus...
t1_dujfq3y	1	*	Like Mexicans in USA 
t1_duaers4	1	*	And 30 is still a scammy price for naproxen combined with esomeprazole. 
t1_duo4qmk	0	*	I see you got some bots to upvote this. 
t1_duql3mr	1	*	Google the legal definition of treason.
t1_dugz0w3	0	*	They don't. It is something that happened in Germany not in Britain and it wasn't an online comment. You gotta read the article.
t1_dul4zkh	1	*	You missed the /s
t1_dupeopr	1	*	[FOXNEWS](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-Fox-News-effect-What-causes-it) might be the root cause.
t1_dunrt5g	1	*	I bet the 2nd amendment people could do something. 
t1_duf2l32	1	*	While true these new nesting grounds will not have the same protection from humans as their current grounds.
t1_duob01g	1	*	Its called trolling the very smart people who actually think conservative american citizens are Russian bots
t1_duqf6ic	0	*	Do you hate the aclu?
t1_dud5p9l	1	*	When you care about US politics more than your own shitty country
t1_dujjkvl	1	*	> The sun is still shining in WA 2 hours after it has set in the eastern states. How excellent would it be to take advantage of that extra solar power during our peak times.  Yeah, but... Australia is huge. Also I imagine toward the end of the day is when people in WA are coming home and putting on the air conditioner.
t1_duux3hx	0	*	The right wing loves Poles?  That's news to me.  Can you explain this?
t1_duq2575	1	*	u know that thing called war?
t1_duukidq	1	*	Well drug dealers!!! is a convinient excuse because it allows disproportionate targeting of hispanic and african american individuals...  Get ready for War on Drugs 2, Electric Boogaloo
t1_duxosmi	0	*	> It was an abuse of power but it obviously isn't sexual harassment in the bandwagon she's trying to jump on   I think just like you
t1_duz726w	0	*	I think its the opposite lol. Trump shifts away interest from European countries. The right wing is growing quickly in Europe and I feel like it doesn't get much press.   For example, Sweden has their elections coming up in 2018 and the Swedish democrats(cultural isolationists) might get a large large part of parliament(like 25-30%, for reference they were at like 2% 12 years ago).    But no one really talks about it because Trump is such an idiot lol
t1_dubuph1	1	*	o7  Mueller approacheth.
t1_duv137f	1	*	Either that or they do it together. 
t1_du9ne6g	1	*	Paid for in full by the drug habbits of united States nationalist. 
t1_dun2tlc	1	*	Nice to see a fan in the wild. 
t1_dui81bf	1	*	IIRC we all made fun of them for most of 2012 for thinking about leaving the EU to solve their financial crisis, then we decided to leave the EU and create our own financial crisis for no apparent reason. 
t1_duw5ejp	0	*	It's going to be around +4-5 Celsius tomorrow where my parents live up in Canada. That ain't normal at all either for this time of year. They barely had two weeks of -30 this winter, a far cry from January averaging under -35 back when I was in gradeschool. Deciduous trees are growing more and more up north as well.
t1_duiaa56	1	*	I don't get it
t1_dudriz1	0	*	Says the guy who uses the term antifags. 
t1_dusgo81	0	*	Well if you voted for him. This is what you asked for.
t1_dufvnnu	1	*	They are cannon fodder for stuff
t1_dufvnno	1	*	Love me some ACI
t1_duwn0x7	0	*	We have a bit under 20,000 so 200 is about 1%
t1_dulr2if	1	*	> horse candidate   No, that's Sobchak.
t1_dunc66q	1	*	Who? The Russian bots. Sure, the will like whatever he says.
t1_dutf435	1	*	Can he just unilaterally rescind the term limit?  In the US, the federal government has zero authority to repeal the term limit on the POTUS. 
t1_dud86we	1	*	And nothing will.
t1_dujo557	1	*	Trumpets...
t1_dupjyvx	1	*	So basically, mainstream Democrats.
t1_ducthwy	1	*	> Fake audio and video can be produced relatively easily, and that is what we will begin to see more of.   So Radiolab actually got their hands on an Obama bot.  [It's not perfect, but it's pretty damn close, especially if you're watching it on a phone.](http://futureoffakenews.com)
t1_duqwrrk	0	*	I mean why would the U.S. or any other country intervene. Military interventions are expensive.
t1_dubl8ql	1	*	That's what the intelligence community has been warning about since this interference was first revealed.  Watch any of the senate testimony from heads of the CIA or FBI about Russia.  They amplify whatever discord already exists to increase polarization.
t1_dusvo3g	1	*	*He'll do it! He is such a good negotiator! He has the Mexcan president right where he wants him! MAGA!* - Stupid people probably
t1_duyjovj	0	*	Staring Alec Baldwin and Amy Poehler
t1_duddpxm	0	*	This is literally a divide and conquer tactic.  It seems to be working even when called out, though.
t1_duyumk0	1	*	/r/iamverybadass
t1_duqfpse	1	*	Point  ---------- . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .     YOU
t1_duhw4w2	1	*	It's been that way since 2008.
t1_duea5tj	1	*	I wonder why India is not in that list. Huge presence of Russian tourists in Goa beaches.

t1_duqae8l	1	*	There was a big stink about the corrupt NRA years ago that came and went. People seem to have forgotten that in modern times they are purely a political body. They are not a fun little group for responsible gun owners to hang with like-minded people.
t1_ducs3yz	1	*	Its not Twitter influcing us specifically - its the psychology of mob mentality. By artificially inflating likes and upvotes our tribal nature wants lures us into wondering why everyone but ourselves are on board with idea x, y or z. Divisiveness and arbitrary arguments follow which weakens the society as a whole. 
t1_dupszau	1	*	We are gonna invade you with what? Flying on broomsticks over the atlantic? lmao
t1_duah19i	1	*	Even as a Chinese, I have to say what you're saying is too extreme. All news sources do have an agenda but you can't systematically disregard a news source like that.
t1_duujjil	0	*	I would rather have WW3 than allow China to invade Taiwan with no one stopping them. Appeasement does not work and there needs to be a red line where we make a stand. It needs to be made clear that the world will not allow an invasion of Taiwan.  Edit: and inb4, yes I would be willing to personally enlist and fight against china.

To put it another way, the guys in the middle East are terrorists supported by anti-US organizations at the nation-state level, with access to weaponry beyond anything you'd ever be able to get your hands on. They are essentially rats in holes that get smoked out with drones firing 100k+ a shot smart munitions.

I scroll through the comments here, note how you guys treat people with the same opinion as my and realize that nobody is actually interested in what I have to say.

t1_dukp4ct	0	*	I don't understand how KFC has chicken that is both more expensive and not as flavorful as Popeyes.

t1_duna35o	1	*	> the slime is strong with this one  Something looks wrong  I'm sure I read some (admittedly speculative article) months ago which seemed to suggest that he was living a lifestyle which his known levels of publicly declared income wouldn't be able to afford
t1_dui7hv4	1	*	It's funny blaming the Chinese when the big pharma has a bigger hand in the tragedy. And it seems like you're behind on the news. They've already been punished.  
t1_dun3q7c	1	*	Not really, the left still dominates mainstream comedy. Also part of the humour in politically incorrect jokes is the shock value. When a left leaning comedian makes a racist joke it's more shocking (and more funny if the joke is actually good), whereas someone on the far right saying a racist joke is a surprise to no one. 
t1_dua1x8s	1	*	yes and it would be good if we could gradually aim to eliminate emissions, toxic waste, toxic pesticides, toxic household materials, and any other activities that is damaging our water, soil, and air.  But moving away from processed foods is a start. I dont propose banning them at all, but i think a movement that pushes for awareness and at least promotes more natural products would be good for our well being. Would at the least lower the amount of people suffering from diabetes.
t1_duigd6l	1	*	Well the Earth will be absolutely fine.  We may be on the way out, but no worries. 
t1_duusvqx	0	*	The classic Irony. Hitler despised drug culture - the pure Aryan!  He also had a personal morphine doctor and had to constantly regulate meth use in parallel. 
t1_duzgukl	0	*	Theres a lot that seems wrong, but when you think about it this is exactly the process you want. Doing the thing is nearly always cheaper than the thinking and consultation involved in doing a thing right.  Which is part of the reason it is so irritating when someone still isnt done right after all those processes are followed.
t1_duwmjzn	1	*	Lol, militias are shit too.  Any time a group tries to organize and prep- BOOM INSTANT DOMESTIC TERRORIST.
t1_duj99rh	1	*	Well we have Reddit falling for blatant propaganda here so it seems pretty universal in these western countries that dominate the internet.

t1_dulilv5	0	*	He also justified going against Sweden in particular becuase we're clearing mines in Afghanistan, which somehow makes us responsible for 50,000 civilian casualties (sic!).   Oh and because there are pizzerias run by PKK and Peshmerga, funneling funds for atheist kurds. (sic!, again)

t1_dur7igp	1	*	>they're not even cleared  She's got an interim clearance. So she's allowed to see and work with classified material. There are just restrictions on handling it,which I'm sure she has staff to do. The questions of whether she's the correct person to be doing this or whether she should have any kind of clearance, though, are separate arguments that have a lot more meat to them. 
t1_dui8k2z	1	*	You're implying that vote manipulation and dirty elections aren't commonplace around the world. I wouldn't know if the UK has a way to make sure its elections are legitimate. 
t1_dumjllf	1	*	Like it or not, Putin has massive support behind him. I am Russian, and let me tell you, a whole lot more than 5% of Russia supports Putin. He is applauded by nearly everyone I know. Just because America makes it seem as if Russians live in fear and hatred of him does not make it true. Everybody who believes that Russia hates Putin has not visited or lived in Russia.

Surely you're a top mind, perfect for serving this president.

t1_duwdegh	1	*	I've always wondered, what happens once most of the ice has disappeared? I mean, I know there is less reflection, but wouldn't removing ice also enhance the temperature as there is no cooling substance remaining? Like removing ice cubes from a glass of water in a microwave.

t1_duuf29v	1	*	There was an article yesterday saying her husband got employed at Facebook, which is probably the source of confusion 
t1_dumiu2l	0	*	If the whole idea was to cause us to lose faith in our institutions, then admitting that some of them are working right is a false step.  And if it's to make us argue more, then admitting that the charges are true just takes something to fight over off the table.  So I'm not sure what the angle is, but I'm sure there's an angle. Like maybe Putin has decided that Trump as POTUS is just a terrible idea so now he's trying to weaken his presidency.
t1_durfo32	0	*	you may have a point. I place a very high value on my individual rights. I have a right to bear arms and I love it.

t1_durit3d	0	*	The Empire of Japan started the war, not the hundreds of thousands of Japanese civilians who were hit by atomic bombs.. they are, by very definition, victims of war. US military action around the world does much more harm than good, and youd do well to remember that next time you think of writing ignorant remarks such as this. 
t1_duo051b	1	*	Yea, take a pill get high and forget about it.   Every single person I know who begins taking antidepressants thinks they're better and may not be depressed anymore but they're always different than before the meds and depression.
t1_duymx4b	1	*	As a Yank expat in Denmark, you're not kidding.  We don't get a lot of snow here as a general rule (though this past week has been an exception), but even a few centimeters and the headlines are all snow chaos and the trains are delayed.  I remember growing up where 30cm of snow was a normal winter day. You still went to work, if not school. Here, 5cm is enough to make people lapse into a coma.
t1_duxqwwp	1	*	The U.S. is almost out of wars, business will need to be drummed up somewhere.....unfortunately.

No matter how much we'd like to pretend he was elected on accident, he has solid supporters.   EDIT: Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe internet trolls, russian spies, and neo-nazis are his only true supporters. It's just distressing to learn that *almost half* of all voters are internet trolls, russian spies, and neo-nazis. But hey, at least he has no true American supporters!
t1_duqcey1	1	*	This was for the old regime in ukraine... 
t1_dups8mk	0	*	He was criticized for damaging a woman's reputation without any evidence. The questions were asked by students and one said she was a journalist and tried to appeal to his conscience, insisting that moral standards should also apply to Wolff. Apparently he didn't like that.  EDIT: conscience, not consciousness
t1_duy6ifu	0	*	Majority of people here have nofucking clue as to who pussy riot is, west made them out to be legitimate protesters when in reality they are just a bunch of disrespectful degenerates. You are right, if they did even something slightly similiar in US to what they did in Russia, they would be jailed
t1_dupf3rd	0	*	>Fuck military  I mean that's easy to say when you're part of an alliance where the USA covers the brunt of the costs in both per capita GDP and total numbers. A country so close to Russia would not have the luxury of spending less on military if it weren't in such an alliance.    And btw, Germany is a large producer of weapons like most other large European economies.
t1_ducrsug	0	*	Probably very effective? Data analysis of their actions shows that less than 1 in every 10,000 Americans even *saw* a single one of their tweets. Even fewer would have changed their vote based off that tweet.   Furthermore, I find the suggestion that minorities are more susceptible to propaganda to be highly problematic at best.

t1_duh7y5m	1	*	Fingers crossed!
t1_dultu4b	1	*	But during the last century, wasn't Ireland essentially officially a catholic country? Not sure what that meant legally but it certainly seems like the church had tremendous influence. I watch some TV series about an Irish immigrant to Brooklyn (and that's what it was called) in the 1950s and iirc the church was always present in their lives.
t1_dua5zta	1	*	Which is bullshit. Ask them a follow up if theyre going to be shooting a lot of cops and soldiers, cause thats who they would fight, and watch them crumble.

I am probably autistic, but if i was diagnosed back in middle school or earlier i would probably be put in special needs class - which honestly was probably the worst place for anyone to be.

You want to talk about a crisis? 200,000 Americans die from medical errors yearly. Thats under the supervision of physicians, nurses, and paramedics.

t1_dust0xy	1	*	Yea, the TI methodology is far from perfect because it uses a survey method and polls certain groups of people. I looked at a list of the amount of black money in the system for every country and that seems like a better substitute. 
t1_dublrop	1	*	Been saying this for some time now. If Putin really has it out for America, Trump is *purely* means to an end.  Distrust in American government and discord are the aims of Russian influence.  Putin has no goal but to best the enemy who brought down the USSR, no matter current global reality

t1_dudd1q9	1	*	> He basically told the attorneys to take it to an Article III court. This is huge and has insane due process implications.

t1_dujvab0	1	*	Makes me wonder how Trump supporters justify this in their heads.  Obama didn't save us from Trump!  Boooo Obama!  Wait..er...
t1_duyd5f6	1	*	Yeah why don't they just cure every mentally ill person that is alive and that will  ever be born. That sounds a lot more doable than getting rid of guns.
t1_dulpg7i	1	*	Russia was always mean to people she doesnt like. Have you never heard of the gulags?
t1_duljdc2	0	*	Why are they called strippers then? Sounds like a regular dancer or entertainer. Just clickbait?
t1_dusiova	1	*	Dude... I voted for George W... twice... and was banned from the Donald for asking a question. I used to like the GOP, long ago, but I voted for Obama twice with a mixed ticket for midterms and stuff.  GOP made voting easy now though. Straight democrat ticket now. That party is dead to me for countless reasons. It's the definition of a dumpster fire.
t1_dudxqjv	1	*	It's crazy right? Humans can have human emotions.
t1_duaeiml	1	*	Also kind of seems like what they always say not to do- glorify the murderer. Thanks news. 
t1_dujvnf4	1	*	That has never happened.
t1_dua8tbu	0	*	So two groups that enjoy being independent nations overlap? Shocker....
t1_duos83n	0	*	I am confused at what you are saying  1) nafta is not dead...yet?  2)usa farmers were subsidized by te goverment heavily, running yellow corn mexicans producers off the market, if anything they were the ones benefiting of a distorted market  3) it was USA taxpayers 
t1_dua4rih	0	*	Before I say what I say, I'm living in a country with some of the strictest legislation - and have basically no issue with it. Also it makes a damn lot of sense to restrict who can buy guns!  **However**  There are two issues I see with America: there are already so many guns out there in your country (can't apply laws retroactively), and this would set a precedent of amending the Bill of Rights. That second one in particular is a seriously slippery slope y'all really don't want to go down.
t1_duin73i	1	*	Several times. It would have actually dropped the income they get from the Federal Gov.
t1_duyplft	1	*	That's like saying Americans shouldn't concern themselves with the treatment and slaughter of Native Americans because we don't know how many we killed and because it was limited to just certain military orders from certain short-sighted generals and politicians. 
t1_dui90z2	1	*	Spending control is crucial. If you give the government more money today, they are just going to use the cash to buy more bombs. 
t1_duph8uv	1	*	Thoughts and prayers. 
t1_duw9k9k	1	*	Why do you think there's an urgency to colonize other planets? Because those in the know, know there's little hope left for the future of this planet.
t1_ducwaoj	1	*	We in the UK allow 18 year olds to drink...
t1_duxtdo1	1	*	It's easy if you try    No hell below us    Above us only sky   &nbsp;   [A Perfect Circle's cover](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dunKAwRN3P8) is my favourite.

t1_duszcft	1	*	This presidency goes to 11.
t1_duglqkh	0	*	This is a flaw in the U.S.s immigration policy. A lot of students who arrive on a visa are subject to a two year rule where they must return home for at least two years after graduation.   We educate foreign students in some of the worlds top schools but make it very difficult for them to apply this knowledge to the USs benefit if they (or even potential employer) want to 
t1_dullt0u	1	*	Yeah it seems he does not want these firms to be hit by the shrapnel of the indictment explosion.
t1_durrsvf	0	*	I mean, as a Conservative who doesnt own any guns but also doesnt think the NRA is to blame, its not free speech if its on someone's platform. They dont have the *right* to do what they want on someone else's platform. You feel?
t1_duakuim	1	*	Like drawing dicks on potholes.
t1_dun9e4f	1	*	Depends who you ask and depends what news source you take as gospel. Instead of agitating maybe you could provide some good source material for both of your statements. 
t1_duygt5r	1	*	That'd be a neat challenge for them.
t1_duap63u	1	*	Neither is a weather report but some people like to stay updated on that kind of thing. 
t1_dunjhoc	1	*	Thank you for this.  You're not alone in your opinion.
t1_duf7zzv	1	*	More than you do if you're asking a question like that. 
t1_dulbj1c	1	*	Fun era strippers! Yeah!
t1_dulh0a8	1	*	It's absolutely not, they excite both sides. They're known to operate BLM-style twitter accounts for instance.
t1_ducs2r4	1	*	They're trying really, really hard to delegitmize Trump winning the presidency. They think people are stupid enough to buy it. That somehow some supposed Russian bots posting random shit on Twitter swayed an entire election in favor of Trump. Their base eats it all up because they lack critical thinking and are easily propagandized.
t1_dugqfah	1	*	Half of us are still really pissed about this
t1_dusl8p7	1	*	Usually cease fires happen when that's not the way it's gonna go
t1_dusluhs	1	*	I legit feel sorry for the next democrat president, though. The shitstorm that person is going to receive is going to drown out any type of criticism that Obama received from the right during his presidency.  The tone for what is acceptable criticism for a president has been already been set under Trump.

t1_duyw5bi	0	*	I like Maplin. It's nice to be able to browse weird electronics.
t1_duhqcip	1	*	Don't you think it is suspicious that the billboards were suddenly removed after these particular messages were set up?  And they were removed at night, less than 24 hours after being set up, when the removal notice has been there for months?  Doesn't the situation stink? Or your sense of smell is destroyed by your blindness to all that is labour?!
t1_dujalx2	0	*	It's not really a competition.  Everyone benefits from improved infrastructure.  Instead of competing, we need to start collaborating.
t1_dujbsr6	1	*	I watchedthis documentary on netflix about russia abd homophobia. The dude hosting it interviewed the politician who put that law about homophobic propaganda into place. The shit he was saying about gays and to gays was so fucked up, because he was saying it on camera and no one seemed to care
t1_dusw8m5	0	*	Tens of thouands of Christians visit Jerusalem to visit the Holy Sepulchre  among other sites. I find it closed as a protest against Israeli policies calls those policies into question.    It's not genius, it's calling attention to discrimination. Do you get it now? 
t1_duqwxk5	1	*	I'd just take all the charges and say I did everything.  I'd make shit up I didn't even do but they don't know who did.  I would take every charge I could possibly eat and just go sit in a cushy fed joint and wait for my last day of Trump's run pardon.  There's no respect like taking one for the team, and their team is ballin out of control.

t1_duut5g0	0	*	What I find odd is that the public will ostracize a famous person overnight after one accusation. I know there are some very bad predators out there, but I thought we had due process. We're so quick to jump on bandwagon accusations.
t1_duz7449	1	*	This.  These dumbasses don't know the difference between skunk and skank weed. 
t1_due3oob	0	*	Maybe you're conflating the [allegations of the Clinton Foundation engaging in human trafficking in Haiti](https://www.snopes.com/monica-petersen-killed/) and assassinating the journalist Monica Petersen for trying to cover it (allegations as in alleged, unproven - interesting reading though, see what you think).
t1_duv2a78	0	*	Uh, I think he's called recep tayip erdogan
t1_dunnkho	1	*	Yea, you're behavior is going to have to change if we want the planet to be nicer. If you're too lazy to do that... well I wish you would leave this planet. 
t1_dufvyr6	1	*	> What are the odds of someone actually surviving these kind of crashes  Depends what you mean by these kind of crashes. If you're taking about flying into the side of a mountain, the odds are rather low, but for most other crashes, the survival rate is actually very high.
t1_duf38cl	1	*	Yeah it does sound like hes promoting other Global Players to invest into their ad system. Look guys the Russians successfully dividing our Nation through our ads Network! Imagine what YOU could be able to do with our help!!! Invest $$ and we make it happen!! 
t1_dunneic	0	*	I actually have never seen it at McDonalds, or BK, or Wendys. I haven't seen styrofoam used in fast food for 15 years. The thin cardboard and paper is cheaper.

t1_dugargt	0	*	Lol he's not going to prison

t1_duvfln7	1	*	The  Chinese also illegally built a military base in international waters in an attempt to claim Filipino fishing waters. They have started calling that area of international waters their territory and they threaten any ships that try to enter the area. 
t1_dups6ka	1	*	Gates, who was indicted with former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort in October on conspiracy and other charges **related to their lobbying work in Ukraine**, will appear in federal court in Washington at 2 p.m. on Friday to enter the plea, according to court records.
t1_duhj5xa	1	*	Extra Virgin Olive Oil?
t1_duwc74m	0	*	While you're right about many points, I should note that the mere mentioning of Navalny is quite sufficient for triggering the shit out of school staff, as other similar cases show.
t1_dugucr5	0	*	You can actually read past the second sentence if you try hard enough!
t1_dujkz96	1	*	Yeah, I'm pretty against trump but I don't really see a contradiction this tine. That said, the feb 18th tweet is still prrtty bad.

t1_duup6mi	1	*	Wasn't there a West Wing episode where a bunch of US hunters accidentally crossed the US-Canada border in Montana and then got into a confrontation with the Mounties?  Both sides, the US and Canada, considered it to be psychotic that this was actually going to be an international incident and yet it was.  If I recall correctly the President threatened to deny the hunters in question hunting licenses for life if they didn't stand down.  They stood down.

t1_dup92ab	0	*	TIA, unfortunately.
t1_durakfo	0	*	Surprised to see this on Reddit, but youre exactly right. Japan likes promoting its victimhood to deflect from things like Unit 741. WW2 Japan made the Nazis look like the Care Bears.

I'm not so sure that pressuring Kentucky works mind you, they'll still vote Republican (I get Wisconsin). The reason the EU targeted swing states last time was to put Bush under electoral pressure

t1_durtpop	0	*	140,000 Japanese civilians killed in Hiroshima and an additional 74,000 civilians killed in Nagasaki three days later versus 300,000 Chinese civilians and POW's killed during the Imperial Armies march from Shanghai to Nanking.    I'd say Japan got off easy if that was all it took to end a war they started and then refused to end, even when completely surrounded and cut off from the rest of the world. Aggressors do not get to dictate the terms of their surrender.

t1_duqutaa	1	*	Like Trump said, if she wasn't his daughter, he'd tap it. That's how special she is. So we need to shut up and let Trump be Trump.

t1_dujjgi7	1	*	It's a vote by congress.  Also, he has to be charged with something.  There is a trial and he has to be convicted (again, by congress).  So far we're not even to step 1, which would be to have a case built.  Mueller might be making one, but I'm not sure how much will come of that.  I suspect we're in it until the end of the first term.
t1_duxzq14	1	*	>good. I'm dick and tired of them  Yeah, you are a dick.
t1_dupgwhq	0	*	It depends on what they study's definition of 'rape' is.  In the US they heavily push the stat that '1 in 4 college women are raped or escape attempted rape' at some point, and their definition for 'rape' is... generous, to say the least.  Not to diminish the problems of sexual assault and inappropriate sexual behavior, but too often groups will hamfistedly inflate these numbers to the maximum by having the broadest possible definition of 'rape'.  It can be... unhelpful.
t1_duusumn	1	*	> foreign aggression  Who knew not making enemies and toppling governments would free you from that burden.
t1_duphos9	1	*	Why is everyone staring as the fortune 500 CEO standing there in his underwear and wearing a stained t-shirt during the stockholder meeting, I mean there is a hobo on my street who wears the same?   And no, the world isn't silent on other countries problems either. Honduras knows that no one wants to go the the murder capital of the world. 
t1_duenmuv	0	*	In Exeter and felt nothing - whereabouts were you, North coast I presume?
t1_duf7yg4	1	*	Did he operate troll farms spreading disinformation? I must have missed that bit.

However, Interpol will drop them if there is no real evidence.
t1_dua4p7b	1	*	This is totally ridiculous. Unless you plan to lead and win a total revolution against the government, your guns aren't going to do shit to protect you against the government. If you resort to violence against the government, you're either going to die or spend the rest of your life in prison (unless you somehow kill every cop and soldier in the US).
t1_dul8m5l	1	*	In Ireland. In Germany we actually had pretty bible-focussed religion classes. Albeit, you could always opt out and pick 'Norms and Values' instead, which was basically what you described (and crossing over into light Philosophy).
t1_dubmixo	1	*	Ya. I mean just like the last shithole administration that vetted which photos of the president would make it to the press. 
t1_dufumzq	0	*	The bots played along with our system. We set it up for them. I think this whole bot bullshit isn't being taken as it should. It wasn't meddling with our election, but instead exemplifies how the binary party system makes binary decisions based on mass appeal. It's sad that we will probably continue to vote red and blue, disregarding any actual conversation about how fucked up it is to have what are essentially factions in the United States. 
t1_duhotul	0	*	Aren't the southern ice caps increasing.
t1_duc30ew	1	*	Extinctions are worse than genocide, IMO. And thats not meant to downplay genocide. But when an entire species disappears, there will never be anything quite like it again. Its ecological role is always slightly different from other animals, and evolution doesnt replicate things exactly. 
t1_dui8ebs	1	*	The politicians who would do so aren't as amenable to bribery as the Koch puppets are. Theres a reason the Kochs don't donate to Democrats.
t1_duk6b6y	1	*	There are also over three *trillion* trees on the planet today.  To put that into perspective: For every one tree pledged during this initiative, there are three million additional trees in existence. That's not to say that we couldn't use more, of course  we absolutely could, and this is a good step  but there's a long, *long* way to go before we make any kind of meaningful impact on the climate.

Are you saying that because some Chinese babies were killed by the Japanese and some Jewish babies were spared by the Germans, the Japanese were worse? Are you implying that the Germans never killed any Jewish babies, but the Japanese killed all Chinese babies that they encountered?  Edit: Spelling

t1_duqe5gx	1	*	Beat me by four hours. With kpop, production of profitable music is a side benefit to keeping a well-groomed stable of attractive, young prostitutes.  I recall reading how, with one of the many times Kpop idols get stopped at airports for sex trafficking, they were genuinely confused as to what the big deal is: trading sexual favours for a chance at being an idol is just an expected way of life.

t1_duiwsct	1	*	The sentence would still make sense if you replace Russia by the US.
t1_duqzuvq	1	*	What on earth are you talking about? The last coup attempt was in 2002 and US involvement was essentially that they had advanced knowledge of it, but advised the opposition leaders **not** to do it (urging changes through constitutional means). The coups before that were by Chavez's forces. The sanctions largely target powerful individuals in government rather than the general economy. And who was assassinated?

t1_duds0in	0	*	I'll never understand the US philosophy: how is it a good idea to let sick people pay for their treatment? How many times are you going to need to put that $2500 down? Wish you the best

t1_ducg0rz	1	*	I think if this show was much smaller scale you'd be right, but the fact of the matter is this is one of China's most popular televised events throughout the whole year, watched by tens of millions of people and whose content is directly controlled by the central government. Don't you think that the government has a responsibility to show at least a little bit of discretion and prevent these things from happening? If China wants so bad to be a world leader, they need to start acting like one.

t1_dux2d5f	0	*	Amazing! It's sad to see the NDP which has so many good points lose to the two others parties with some terrible opinions on many points. The voting system only benefits the big first two and I'm very sadden it hasn't been changed like it was promised (I do like Trudeau though).
t1_dumjgce	0	*	The people living in the Gaza Strip cannot treat their sewage at any price.  Israel has been conducting a blockade of the territory for over a decade, and prevents the entry of the materials necessary to repair and run the power plant needed to provide the sewage treatment plant with the consistent electricity necessary to process the waste.  This is not a new story.  May of 2016:  http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/ct-gaza-mediterranean-sewage-israel-20160503-story.html

t1_dujoikj	1	*	This is completely mistaken. The indictment explicitly says that there are no charges of collusion *in the indictment*. Unless you're somehow convinced that this indictment is the last that the investigation will produce, your claim that the matter of collusion is settled is laughable.

t1_dua6s08	1	*	You seem to be getting a lot of negativity for saying that it should be called terrorism. I agree that current usage of the word does refer to violence with political motive, but realistically, the people shooting children dead in their school are terrorising people, whichever way you put it.
t1_duj3v8h	1	*	Not a war. We just wish they didn't meddle in our presidential election.

t1_duwtgok	1	*	Those things aren't exclusive. And when we are at it, cruise ships are actually terrible too. Also they aren't just bad for the environment but pretty much the most cancerous part of the tourist industry as they basically overrun coastal cities without generating much revenue for the locals as they eat, sleep, party... mainly on the ship, so locals basically just get the negative effects.

t1_dud7fdq	1	*	Russia's playbook since after WWII has been to prod us in secret until we tear ourselves apart. They will target gun control, immigration, race relations and our trust in our elections and our neighbors. The Russians know they can never beat us and can never invade us so they'll make us do the job ourselves. every piece of rhetoric that is thrown at us we must use to bring ourselves together united Americans will never be defeated. We must stand together for each other.
t1_dublc85	1	*	If you were a history buff you'd know that the problem with McCarthyism was sweeping up innocents, not that there weren't Russian and communist agents infiltrating the government.  Stealing the atomic bomb plans being foremost amongst their accomplishments.

t1_dujn39w	1	*	Well in the U.S. it's estimated 23% of people are homosexual so using that statistic as a base for Russia, if the majority of people live in groups of 4+ then yes there is enough homosexual people for each household.
t1_dut6dc0	1	*	Time to build a wall of your own.
t1_duqrefu	1	*	Start young. Get a law degree, maybe also a political science degree. Aggrandize yourself with those already in power who are unethical. Be willing to do shitty things for shitty people to non-shitty people. When you inevitably get in trouble you have a choice, based on the power you've gained compared to others. Either turn on them to save yourself or assume they will save you. If you've done very bad things, you'll tend to the latter. If you're smart enough. 
t1_duz2miq	1	*	Trump is legit complimenting a foreign regime for how well they have their people subjugated.

t1_duby76d	0	*	Trust me. You wouldn't.
t1_duaf888	1	*	It's not that bad at all. In fact, in the long-term it's really good. It's just that getting out is a bit messy, which is perfect for leftist dumbasses to go 'see! It's really bad!'. But they're just a bunch of dumbasses. Britain had to lop it's tail off to get away from the EU grasp but the tail will grow back and the UK will be fine, whilst the EU steadily gets shittier and shittier.

t1_duqk1n5	1	*	Why are you knowingly spreading false information? The NRA doesnt spend much on buying politicians, which is what that list is about. They instead buy *their own* ads and run them. When you account for that, theyre number 9. What do you gain from lying?   &nbsp;  Edit: In what universe did planned parenthood spend $250 million in the 2016 election? Thats their total income, dipshit. They spent a whopping $1.4 million on the entire 2016 election.

t1_dugbhxt	0	*	I think the idea is that by playing against them you are recognising Israel as a state (which Iran doesn't). Plus if they did go against them and lose, then Iran would lose face.   It's pretty pathetic in all honesty.
t1_duqwqy7	1	*	Yes you could try but most likely it will be stolen before it reaches the intended individual.
t1_dutkfc5	0	*	The anti-vax and pro-nature movement was already a thing in Europe, it's just that nobody reports on it or upvotes it. It's much worse in Europe, take it from someone whose family lives there.  GMOs are banned like everywhere there along with a bunch of safe food additives.
t1_duncbgq	0	*	The article is literally quoting an Amnesty International official. Not everything you disagree with is propaganda. 
t1_dufmdzr	1	*	Because thats how they get away with it. Do it to a child who cant say no and they grow up thinking its the right thing to do so they let it happen to there children. Now get a bunch of old men go up to an adult man who can think for him self and speak out, and see how he reacts when they say that we need to cut some skin off your dick. You know for religious reasons?   
t1_duc1jec	0	*	i think its only a big deal because trump is trying to downplay the crap out of it, if he would just allow an open investigation, and then the FBI or someone goes yup Russians are messing with us publically.  don't even comdemn russia just call them out so people know whats going on forsure, and social media can police itself

t1_dugtpxu	1	*	> Citolopram   is a very mild anti depressant. A heck of a lot of people are taking anti depressants like that and are functioning.  if he has a real debilitating depression and panic attacks he will need to see a psychiatrist

t1_dur58lj	1	*	Yeah, its almost like complaining about US gang violence, while you are in the middle of a gang controlled ghetto or complaining about the Mexican cartel while you are in Mexico.  If I was being beaten up by the police, I would act like a helpless man and grovel like a bitch and try to survive it.
t1_duwn0s3	1	*	Gimme gimme gimme!  100% of ten dollars is better than 10% of 1000 dollars right?

t1_duhfqnp	1	*	Love them! Been watching since Inside Gaming days.
t1_duefjhi	1	*	Rich ones pretty much live abroad (all their top brass children live abroad permanently, owning real estate in EU or something is a status thingie). Middle class feels obligated to go abroad once or twice per year for vocation.
t1_dudzjht	1	*	That's great, the drug companies are learning from street drug dealers. First try is free, then when you're addicted it's full price.
t1_duq9niw	0	*	The issue is them possibly using foreign money to influence elections. That would be illegal, or at best, unethical. 
t1_durjiej	1	*	He was hoping Gates wouldn't flip. He also might be holding onto the vain hope that a pardon will save him(it won't- Mueller is filing state charges for this very reason). Other than that I think he's just desperately stalling for time.

t1_duq67np	1	*	One of the purposes is to maintain sufficient seeds of different species in case they are otherwise lost and we need them to be able to grow different kinds of food with certain properties. It's not about the entire world being wiped out. It doesn't have to be doomsday for them to become useful.
t1_duj7thf	0	*	What in the god damn?  (Are you talking about vault 22?)
t1_dud0ua8	0	*	This could be an invasion of privacy to those who could be voicing their right to free speech. We don't need constant policing. The government  is already in our life enough. I have said it once and it was well accepted the other day here on reddit. I mentioned that each class room should have a gun behind glass, like fire extinguishers are. They are only to be used in an emergency. That would put a stop to these unfortunate shootings. 
t1_dujo9sj	1	*	Wonder how long before he forces the country into chapter 11.  It would be a bad thing.  However, it was prophesied that once he does we would end up with Lisa Simpson as president.
t1_dussoe7	1	*	I mean there is also climate change, pollution, deforestation, coral die outs, green deserts, etc.
t1_duz2590	1	*	Blackwater = untreated sewage water     It's the best description of the PMC and you have to wonder why the CEO chose that name in the first place.

t1_duebiho	1	*	Miss me with that gay shit.  Edit: Damn y'all it's called a joke.
t1_due7ds5	0	*	Of course T_D doesn't care.  It already knows - it's an ongoing part of the propaganda campaign.    In the unlikely event that Mueller *thoroughly* dismantles the ability of the Russian troll network to operate on the American internet, that sub will go quiet very quickly.
t1_duas66n	1	*	It's probably better than the number of plastic forks we produce annually.
t1_dumwdwp	1	*	I'm not familiar with other nations' specifics, but in the case of NZ, things like Japan dropping tariffs on beef from 50% to 9% will be boons to the entire production chain.

t1_duynhsc	0	*	Not all women want the scarves gone. While some want to wear the scarf and think other should be free to choose there will also be those that think forcing everyone to wear the scarves is the best for society. I'm sure the spread is very much related to age.

Australia also had one in the 90's banned guns and has not had another mass shooting since. Sure someone could use a knife or another weapon but you wont have as high a death toll and its much easier to run away from.

t1_duh4q56	1	*	Wow you figured it out! And Mueller isn't investigating Trump, it's actually just a elaborate ruse to *actually* investigate Hillary. But Mueller is also corrupted, and can't be trusted. But wait no it's actually Uranium One! I got it. Obama forged his birth certificate to collude with Russians and leak Hillary's emails so Mueller could drain the swamp.

t1_duyypr0	0	*	Many third world countries have robust selection of laws... Which are selectively enforced, on case by case basis. For example, military mercenary companies are outlawed in Russia.

t1_dursygg	0	*	I was really disappointed in that special. Chris is typically hilarious, and I was genuinely excited about it. After, when I turned it off, I realized sadly that I'd laughed harder at a Sopranos episode the night before than Chris's new special. Not sure I did anything more than scoff in amusement.

Him and his butt-buddies Blair & Bush royally fucked things up in Iraq, not to mention workchoices, children overboard, getting us an economic surplus by selling off government infrastructure instead of making money on the ridiculous mining boom that came and went with Australia left with nothing to show for it... Gun control was one thing he did well, and couldn't have gotten anywhere with it without support from everyone else in government.

Then one day you come home from work and your wife and three year old son are dead from an airstrike.  That rage and need for revenge is going to go the only place it can, the nearby terrorist organizations.

t1_duss0p8	1	*	Haha, Pena Nieto would never be so smart or cunning.
t1_duqb95v	1	*	Protests are done there on a daily basis. This is nothing new. What are a few protests compared to a first significant political victory in a very long while? Israel doesn't have any political victories except for very small and covert ones. It needs some int'l support. So I think that from a strategic point of view, it definitely makes sense.

I couldn't tell if it was a back handed compliment or a pulled punch. What seems clear is we're really not supposed to like the Russians. Our media has been incompetent for years but after Trump won I think it went insane.

t1_duf8d89	0	*	Unfortunately, this is just part of an ongoing trend of hatred and bigotry from some politicians.

Given the recent history of doping cover up in Russia, I won't trust any statement from Russian sources.  Also, Meldonium is taken to increase recovery rate.

Because the goal was never to only get rid of Assad specifically, it was to have rationale for US forces in the region, which there currently are in the eastern half of the country.

The US and Saudis failed in their primary goal of destroying Assad's secular government by funding and arming literal terrorists but that doesn't mean that all is lost for the empire in this situation.

t1_dudc7ce	1	*	What about the Sanders supporters? The trolls supported him, too. Read the article.
t1_dudo5hu	1	*	Well said.
t1_dugql0r	0	*	That's not very capitalistic, that's entirely moralistic.   Value based pricing is how capitalism works. They ask: how much is an engineering degree worth over a lifetime? vs. that of a philosophy degree and then adjust the pricing accordingly.  It's about making more money, not enhancing STEMlord egos.
t1_duhhe18	1	*	 It doesn't seem like anything in the article expressly rules that out.
t1_dur4nvn	0	*	Holy shit this is a stupid comment. What makes you think someones level of wealth affects their policy on the environment? There are rich and poor people who both care and do t care about the environment. Generalising a group like that doesnt help anyone, it just alienates people from having discussions with you.

t1_dutq9h3	1	*	Whats important to keep in mind is the difference between long term concurrent use and normal vaccine dosing.   Search for aluminum in this article. You might want to read the rest of the article as well. Im guessing you might learn something from it.   Im looking for a full version of your article and Ill comment again when Ive read it. 
t1_duy9th9	1	*	Right?  At least American homophobes think it's okay when it's 2 girls lmao
t1_duc3k81	1	*	because russia is threatening to ban insta over there. do you know just how much of a loss that would be for insta? how much of a hit their revenue would take? it's not worth it just for one video, and i'm surprised people didn't see this happening long ago. russia has proved that they aren't bluffing before (when they banned Reddit). insta would have died long ago if there were stupid execs making decisions like that
t1_duxtnqu	1	*	Pretty sure they would turn them into sex slaves. I mean its not far off how they treat them already.
t1_dudnnhw	0	*	So we know that ignorance of the law does not excuse the crime.  Does that carry over into treason?  Does ignorance of where the information was going excuse him from treason?

t1_duhhikh	1	*	I don't know man...  She's 17; was 16 when she joined.  Seems like teen troubles that spiraled out of control.  It involved a boyfriend and recruiters that indoctrinated her.    An adult I can understand, but a kid?  I think that she should be punished, but repatriated and placed in a rehabilitation center. 
t1_duqk3pu	1	*	The guy who continued to actively bring coffee all the way through the inauguration?  Never heard of him
t1_duui99o	1	*	A lot of kids get bullied and feel like social outcasts. In their incredibly limited and pessimistic world view, this sort of thing is their ticket to friends and happiness.

The US administration certainly does not endorse them as such, though.

t1_dugzpnz	0	*	Tuition is capped here so what you said is null. 
t1_dugaetg	0	*	Israel can eat a dick tbh. They'll kick these people out, which is fine, what isn't fine though is that Israel will turn around and tell everyone else they need to take in refugees.
t1_dupg7g1	0	*	Not every country can run a surplus.  Germany is only able to do so because other countries run a deficit.
t1_duvs08y	1	*	I found Bali to be quite over rated, as well. I was expecting an island of beautiful tropic beaches. I  didnt realize it was a place for Ozzy bachelor parties and alcoholic retirees.
t1_duzdjem	1	*	You clearly have no idea how much freight crosses the country
t1_dugvnmd	1	*	please ignore the person we elected to be the most powrrful guy in the world don't seems very safe
t1_dui872f	0	*	Why the fuck can't THIS guy be our president?  It would make SO MUCH MORE SENSE. His businesses are *actually* successful. He would *actually* be able to get the smartest people to work for him. His technology background will lead the US in global markets. He is also one of the leading philanthropists in the world and is actively accomplishing great things.

t1_dumij80	1	*	> East Ukraine >  > East Ukraine resisted the coup in Kiev >  > US supported Poroshenko government sent military to East Ukraine to fight the resistance >  > No ceasefire call for Poroshenko government  It's actually not quite as innocent as simply not calling for a ceasefire. The West, in the form of the IMF, dangled a $15B carrot in front of Poroshenko to make sure he rolled tanks into east Ukraine.   
t1_dul25r9	0	*	You really shouldnt have gone to a catholic school if you didnt expect indoctrination. Catholic Schools should be teaching whatever the hell they want to
t1_dun3uod	1	*	Because this isn't about cost/benefit. We ban child labor not for reasons of profit. Moves to protect the environment often are things that just had to be done, the question becomes not whether it should be done, but how to do it.
t1_duwpkp7	0	*	I doubt it. People pay too much attention to what is really the least significant portion of the dossier. It ranks far below the evidence and accusations of what really amounts to conspiracy against the US and high treason.
t1_duf57cj	0	*	But they clearly affected you lol
t1_dupdzro	0	*	I understood that...you cheeky fucker
t1_duftr0h	0	*	Agreed. I once recall news being about news around the world, less politics and more facts. It's the same in Germany as in the US. Reading the comments on hot topics in German news outlets reminds me of /r/pol and T_D.
t1_dul6ioi	1	*	Unfortunately when I was in secondary school (late 2000s) this was not the case in my school. We skipped the section on world religions which upset me because I was excited for that section. I don't think this is common now and probably wasn't even that common when I was in school, I was just unlucky that my school chose to teach religion in that way. I actually took a world religion course at uni and it was fascinating so I'm glad that I eventually got to indulge that curiosity. 
t1_dunegws	1	*	It's not like they're going to do nothing until 2029 and then suddenly stop everything overnight. I think 12 years isn't a bad time scale to have completely phased out the use.
t1_dup6ima	1	*	They arent by any means. This article pretty much communicated the opposite of the actual Truth.
t1_duni8u6	1	*	My suggestion would be that the comment about being I'll treated because there was no cafeteria is so Russian. Sure we all like food, but cafeteria food in North America is not something to wish for. 
t1_duprfsn	1	*	Hopefully give some tax breaks to the lower and middle class - would be a great boost for the economy and return part of it right away as sales tax.
t1_dugshyp	1	*	you figured it out...  everyone does what they want and he takes the fall  
t1_dufczjj	0	*	Well we have gone 150 years without a civil war, while provinces enjoy greater self-determination and autonomy in a Canadian Federation than the US states do in an American Federarion. I'd say we're doing alright. 
t1_dusexz6	1	*	Nothing ironic about it. Theyre blocked precisely because they wont agree to stuff like this. 
t1_duuq8hv	0	*	I believe it was Spanish and Spain declared war over it for like a week.
t1_dur5zor	1	*	The SJWs who made up that stat defined sex while drunk as rape.  Of course, the guy who was also drunk was the rapist.  So much for sexual equality.
t1_dudis1j	0	*	Until you take into consideration that pharmaceutical prices are unregulated and companies are allowed to set their prices as high as they want.   Add in the fact that they create products that people literally rely on to live so it's not as if their customers aren't going to find a way to buy them.  
t1_dufct7e	0	*	That's a thing? What's the history behind that?
t1_dui91ef	0	*	Buffett isn't too bad either from what I hear.
t1_dunbe1i	1	*	Did you see the memes in question? It's kinda hilarious that the establishment is stating that Hillary lost the election cos of a few badly made memes and not her own epic failings as a candidate.

t1_durrvou	0	*	every country on earth, every single one, has mental health issues.  But it's America that has epidemic levels of gun violence.  So...it's not a mental health issue as such. (support and treatment of people with mental health issues, that does play into it though)

t1_dusdw9a	1	*	The Russians got banned for state sponsored doping, not doping in general.   I guess so far they haven't found any evidence that Uncle Vlad paid for their PEDs   
t1_dusyjhj	1	*	Changing the constitution is basically impossible, especially in support of such an unpopular president. The real red flag will be if he starts positioning someone from his inner circle as a successor. Doubly so if hes re-elected, and triply so if there are any irregularities in that election. 
t1_dui7wf8	1	*	Whats that then?

The standard is just so high in the west no one will ever work that hard. The people calling out all immigrants as lazy just will probably never do that much hard labour.

Would said bridge like to meet up online so we can see if we are compatible? I'm getting the tingles just thinking about it. Stop teasing and let's get this moving.
t1_duuvcly	1	*	I literally saw that episode last night.
t1_ducszsz	1	*	I wonder how many of these will be dealt with legitimately.
t1_duxcg12	0	*	Point is that nobody would raise an eyebrow if they had just issued a formal statement saying 'We really don't like people using the phrase 'Polish Death Camps'. Those were run by Nazi Germany, not us.'  What is the real problem is the amount of jailtime you can get for using the phrase. It's unlikely that people will be convicted for a slip of tounge, but still. It's not like the rest of the world has ever tried to paint the Poles as the ones responsible for the crimes comitted there.
t1_dukh36g	1	*	Yes and Trump sought to immediately reverse all of Obama's actions against Russia, [including giving back their compounds for nothing](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-administration-moves-to-return-russian-compounds-in-maryland-and-new-york/2017/05/31/3c4778d2-4616-11e7-98cd-af64b4fe2dfc_story.html?utm_term=.53d9c747d42a)...

t1_duwx7xh	1	*	It's more complex that that. Ireland doesn't agree with the EU competition authorities assessment of where the taxes are due and is challenging it in the ECJ. So naturally, it will be difficult for Ireland to decide on the amount Apple owes, when they don't even believe that the tax is due in Ireland.

t1_duykifd	1	*	Yeah but its going to get buried the moment Trump says something like I would have taken a bullet for a black child. Or some stupid shit that the media will quickly pick up to monetize on Facebook.  Its always the case - whenever something super relevant starts surfacing, he does something else to distract the media from real issues.

t1_dusmgbt	0	*	The population of Iran has grown rapidly to 81,000,000 .  There is a great deal of poverty and it's going to get much, much worse.  The overpopulation is far beyond what is sustainable and the largest segment of the population is of child bearing age.  Iran, like much of the middle east, is very dependent on imported food paid for with oil revenues.  A crash in the oil market may very well create a famine.

t1_duuaoat	0	*	There has never been a leader in history that removed checks on his own power in order to do more good for everyone.  Those who genuinely did good for others in their leadership positions never worried about checks on their power because the checks were always there to stop the incompetent and corrupt.  Those who have attacked the checks on their power universally turn out to be much worse than they were when those checks existed.
t1_dutzemz	1	*	I think it's funny they break the rules to be honest. Win at all costs. Russia is the best
t1_duc9cna	1	*	In the US, it's because the hospital and/or physician is on the hook for the medical care of any injuries the child may have sustained during childbirth.  So God forbid if the kiddo starts to show the earliest sign of decelerated heart rate or other fetal distress, or if they are bigger than normal, off to C-section you go.

t1_duqlmlk	1	*	I don't think not enough greed is the problem with Venezuela.  The problem is that their government has deprived business owners and workers of the tools necessary to safeguard their own interests.  Workers are underpaid as their salaries are inflated to worthlessness, and businesses owners can't get a return on their investment as their property is expropriated.  Soon, there won't be anything left for the Chavistas to steal.

Coming to Military intervention ,We could've done that but Myanmar is our ally due to 'Look east' policy .We cant malign relationship with Myanmar either .
t1_dua9ypq	0	*	You're right. Hillary was such a shitty candidate, she lost to Donald Trump.
t1_dussl2h	1	*	To be fair, the rebuilding in Aleppo is moving faster than expected, there was a guy in the syrian civil war sub documenting some of the things being rebuilt and the process that is happening.   I mean, if you look at Damascus outside of rebel territory, it is still very much a normal city. 
t1_dueyu5r	0	*	I mean, they can make their own standards as they see fit. Thats really what the article is entailing.   Acting as though thats a problem is pretty stupid.
t1_duradoq	1	*	Yes. Except that we developed the rules of war after this. And it was an unbelievable decision.   Drop a weapon that made someone willing to fight to the death to give up. Or fight a war at the cost of millions of lives. 
t1_duml1s7	1	*	Hi-Points for everyone!

t1_dux2h7a	0	*	If it has Democratic in it, it's definitely not decmocratic.   But if it has Empire in it, it's definitely an empire?  Life is sure a mystery sometimes.
t1_dusm6s6	1	*	49%
t1_duug89w	1	*	In the past; UK and France. Later on, the USA. And if the USA doesn't, then any country of interest like Russia, China, or India.
t1_durny2a	1	*	Russia doesn't care if people believe them. They just need to stick to their story. Its the same method donald trump is employing. And why do you think he's employing the same method as the kremlin? Because he fucking works for them.
t1_dun4u87	0	*	I would say he would have definately got around 10-15% in the first round. But more importantly he would have the opportunity to appear on national TV, which would be a game-changer.  He would have 0% chance to get elected in 2018. But his chances for 2024 (considering Putin cannot take part in those) would be rather high.

t1_duqac0z	1	*	Are you a non-native English speaker by any chance?  The only heavily upvoted comment there was a joke about semantics of the preceding comnent
t1_duji6vd	0	*	Without any context this comment could apply to another prominent family in power in our government.  And is perhaps the reason why we are having this conversation today.
t1_duq6bfw	0	*	yes you fall for every pro-war brainwash where you believe literally any fake news story there is, yes we already know people in the west is not capable or responsible enough too not get propagandized into starting yet another war in the world.  this is exactly why North Korea needs nuclear weapons. to keep warmongers like your regimes in check. since force is the only language that stops the western aggressors from violating your sovereignty.

t1_dulllvz	1	*	I think due to Ireland being quite strongly religious (protestants and catholics), many people assumed that this meant indoctrination rather than the typical RE lessons. 
t1_dutzv22	0	*	Also, fucking over the environment is not managing or cultivating. If Jesus leaves you an orchard to manage, I doubt he'd be too pleased if he comes back to see you chopped down all his apple trees and sold them for firewood.

t1_dupih6f	0	*	Nothing. That's been a huge critique point for the past years. They're so concerned with keeping a steady and unflucuating growth that they've amassed a huge surplus, which is just lying around not doing anything, even though it could be used in many social projects.
t1_dulur6x	0	*	They should all convert to Judaism. That will not only solve their problems but also cause additional problems for the Palestinians. Israel would love that.  
t1_dukn9nx	1	*	the US is moving its embassy to 'west-jerusalem', which has never been on the negotiating table..  given that 'west-jerusalem' isn't even part of the Palestinian claims, I don't understand the Palestinian position here.
t1_dun66dm	1	*	I asked some taxi drivers about him when I was there and every one of them loved him. Common responses were that the drug users and pushers in their immeadiate area surrounding their homes were gone. One of them got irritated when I (slightly) criticized him.

t1_dudg4ak	1	*	How do you think this list was made?
t1_durqhno	1	*	>will Japan accept the atrocities they committed to the Chinese before parading its own victims?  They have already apologized for it. On the other hand, has China ever apologized for their war crimes? I have at least never heard of them doing that, and when I searched it on Google, all of the results were about Japanese apologies to China.
t1_duu733c	0	*	When the others are talking like you do, worshiping your gods, holding the same political views and raise their children just like yours, there's no need to take anything over anymore: they're your people already.  I believe most 4x games call it a 'cultural victory'

t1_duuxrqi	0	*	I don't know. Same here, the closest I can get is when I look at the map, ITTOQQORTOORMIIT is at 2.2 deg C which is 36 deg F. It's not the northernmost and it's not 43 deg F, but it's close.

t1_duiyj74	0	*	As a russian I can say that most part of our population is quite conservative on that matter and there are many quite aggressive dipshits.  But at least me and most of my friends are tolerant to gays.   Anyways, if I were gay, I'd rather pick different country to live in. Better be safe, than sorry.   EDIT 1: /u/Princess_Paesh provided a link to a [map](http://ilga.org/downloads/2017/ILGA_WorldMap_ENGLISH_Overview_2017.pdf) of gay-friendly countries. Some could use it.
t1_dunlq2n	0	*	The bill voted down by the Florida house called to banning the sale of assault weapons which they defined as guns capable fully automatic, semi-automatic or burst fire. Almost every gun is capable of semi-automatic fire. The bill was designed to fail a vote since it called for pretty much a ban on 90% of all guns. And it being unconstitutional would just make it an instant waste of time for everyone involved.
t1_dupkd2u	0	*	So getting rid of all guns is a bad law?  I mean sits working out over here quite well. We don't have people complaining about mass shootings over here. Our cops aren't killing us over here.  Its pretty great. 
t1_duwrfls	1	*	Accidental polonium green tea overdose.

t1_duj9uqr	1	*	what are you going on about?  There is no research and development cost.  This drug is more than 40 years old.  It's the second sentence of the damn article.  They raised the price of one dose from $50 to $768 because if people want to live they have to pay it, that simple.

t1_duk383j	1	*	Thats what i've been thinking for a while now. I'm not so sure that he is intentionally lying and doing all these horrible things. I think he might just not know what he is doing. Its probably best to just put him in a home, honestly. 
t1_due7ly8	1	*	Literally since the early 80s. It went full force when Reagan enacted trickle down policies that will never leave our government and economy. 
t1_dunutrx	1	*	Canadian here - I just had a McDonald's breakfast to go yesterday. The eggs and bacon came in a styrofoam plate with plastic lid - both fairly flimsy and minimal, but still, I did a double take at how big my garbage bag was afterwards.   When the dish is wet or oily, you usually either get it in a round foil dish or styrofoam container. Foil is definitely better if you wash and recycle but I'm not sure how many people actually do that

t1_dubkvbd	1	*	There's plenty of examples of pro-left wing causes being supported by these Russian groups. There was an anti-Trump rally with 5,000-10,000 people including  Michael Moore that was planned by a [Russian Facebook group](http://thehill.com/policy/technology/358025-thousands-attended-protest-organized-by-russians-on-facebook). 
t1_due8g9j	1	*	> The conservative groups involved include the Heritage Foundation, which has pushed for the lifting of environmental protections, and the Cato Institute, co-founded by billionaire oil barons Charles and David Koch. In Britain the project is being overseen by the Initiative for Free Trade (IFT), an organisation founded by the hard-Brexit advocate and Tory MEP Daniel Hannan.  It's right there in 3rd paragraph of the article.

t1_dump53p	1	*	Well it's a start to fixing the societal issue. People tend to stick with the status quo and follow what others do. If people see them picking up trash they may start to see it as an option to fix the problem. At the very least they may avoid throwing their trash away while they're around.

t1_dunodyw	1	*	>7/9 = ~77%  That's not how math works. That's not how any of this works. 0.3% acquittal means 99.7% convictions. All probabilities total 100%.   99.7% + 0.3% = 100%.
t1_duclw1x	1	*	Investigative journalism often breaks the actual law. Breaking a websites T&Cs seems a little tame by comparison.
t1_dugl89a	1	*	Only GOP voters have the balls to rebel against their party. Democrat voters are TOLD who their elected leader is and they go along like the dogs they are.

t1_duejdoq	1	*	Um yes they actually have a respectable investigative news department. For like 4 or more years, so your a little behind honestly.  It's like Fox News the entertainment channel, vs. local fox news stations, vs. fox news polling. Their polling never aligns with their entertainment channel, which is always kind of funny.

t1_dupnzma	1	*	> There was a time when Germany had a strong military. I am pretty sure you guys dont want that again...  Jesus Christ, why does every thread about modern day Germany always include the fucking nazis. They have nothing in common nowadays. Since they're little kids Germans are always taught about how bad Nazi Germany was.   There are probably more nationalists in Poland than there are in Germany.

t1_dud8ocv	0	*	When a state of federal emergency is declared, No amendments to the constitution can be passed. The social security reform is a constitutional amendment.  As the situation in Rio has been horrible For months on end and Temer looks likely to lose the social security vote, many see the timing as very convenient. It looks like he declared the state of emergency to artificially delay the social security reform vote and buy himself more time.

t1_duykpe3	1	*	So the awesome thing is that Mueller is a Republican appointee and his boss is a Republican appointee. Additionally, the DoJ operates under the auspices of the executive.

t1_dul8tv3	1	*	We weren't forced to pray or anything in class. We actually learned about other religions and how they were formed.
t1_dui6mw7	1	*	Holding onto surplus, while financially prudent, is politically unpopular. Taxpayers don't like the idea that they're giving money for the government to sit on.  Lowering taxes isn't a great idea because the conditions which created a surplus one year, might not exist the following year, forcing the government to make the politically unpopular decision to raise taxes again. Better to keep taxes constant and to give one-time rebates during times of surplus.

t1_dunie2o	1	*	You're right. I struggle with this too. I think about how many people nowadays say they love nature and are exploring outdoors to share selfies on Instagram but can't think about the footprint of their travel, of their diet, of their consumption, etc. The same people write articles about going green and post inspirational quotes about changing the world. The cognitive dissonance is jarring. 
t1_duv5n7y	1	*	Yeah but it's not as if Trump believes in due process. He [ran a newspaper ad](https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/12/politics/central-park-five-exonerees-slam-trump-due-process-anderson-cooper-cnntv/index.html) in the 1989 calling for some (later-exonerated) children to be executed.

t1_duq8rh0	1	*	Its scary how accurate their assessment of our vulnerability was and how we were completely blindsided by it. I guess I just always assumed that my tax dollars were hard at work beefing p a defense budget so that we could be protected from things like this.

The UN should impose sanctions on Drumpf and his crooked regime!

We're talking a demographic that sends a vast amount of funds out the border, came here looking for cheap labor jobs and probably will follow the migration of cheap jobs.  Once all the work is done by robots here it makes sense the people would be displaced.

t1_duqajuf	1	*	This isn't news. We've known for fucking decades how Super PACS and PACs funnel money to corrupt politicians.  Literal blood money helped DT win the Presidency 
t1_duswvk2	1	*	Last time I checked it was a popular republic. /s
t1_duo2dhh	1	*	Fear, mostly. People have been trained to be afraid.  Frightened people want strong leadership.  
t1_due37dm	1	*	That's how we got the first space race, after all
t1_duiiwnp	1	*	Difference is mainly that the US is gigantic and has a lot more in the way of options when it comes to cities a young person can live in. There are cities in the US that are well... Detroit and then there are cities like Dallas which are growing at an ungodly rate. You can also, in the US, opt to at least be poor in a place with better weather than the UK. 
t1_duhrwx8	1	*	I got this directly from a White House insider early this morning.
t1_dugwvr6	1	*	Only because the US is turning itself into a third world shithole.
t1_durw2u2	1	*	My grandfather used to be a safarier in the 70s and 80s. He used to tell me stories about what they would do to poachers they caught in Zimbabwe, Zambia, and South Africa. Ill just say that they do not survive.    They are the ones who give the hunters a bad name by going around any conservation efforts.   All in all, you can only have so many humans benefit from the amount of land that we have. There isnt enough to share and the ones with power are in control. 
t1_duethwe	0	*	> Bryan Jones, 72, of Treorchy, Rhondda Cynon Taff, said: It was like a tremor but it was quite frightening for my granddaughter - she swore a little bit and my wife got up asking 'What was that?'  I love it
t1_dut3jed	1	*	He's not a dictator. The Communist party is in power, he's just its leader.
t1_duewq17	1	*	I'm so glad the US can keep my countries elections safe.
t1_dur0oa8	0	*	Source?
t1_duux7co	0	*	The difference is the economic and technological climate to do so this time is sound...
t1_duazx7w	1	*	You have deflected the arguement, there really aren't that many guns in Australia owned by civilians.
t1_duq8dwh	1	*	Probably not. This doesn't really implicate trump,  he can still play coy. I want to watch him go down but there is no reason why he should question where a very conservative lobby got their money from. 
t1_durkqyn	1	*	Dude Japan is notoriously bad for war crimes and was not going to give up easily. It sucks that civilians had to die but when your country wants to take over the world you're kind of asking for it. 
t1_dusx50x	1	*	Too bad they are disarmed.  
t1_dunpd5v	1	*	remember what happened when someone drew a picture of their God?
t1_dunme22	0	*	Huh? I thought he is now in love with America and hating China after Trump came into power...
t1_dugkxt9	1	*	Actually we support everyone who benefit us. We did the same with Obama over McCain and Romney. The same goes for US it's not a decent point, but dunno.
t1_dukajm3	1	*	Yup, especially since India once planted 50 million trees in one day   [link](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2016/07/india-plants-50-million-trees-uttar-pradesh-reforestation/)
t1_dujg5gg	1	*	>It turns out it's not mandatory.  Thanks for the insight. I was on the fence about whether they were actually going to have to foster gay men if Putin wasn't elected, or if gay marriage was going to be mandatory. Thanks to your comment, those concerns are squashed. 
t1_duefug9	1	*	Its not about the chlorine. Its about the health and welfare of the chickens (which is also linked to antibiotic resistance).
t1_duroxme	1	*	its going going to be known locally as the Trump Fulfillment Center
t1_duqyts2	1	*	Does she have an interim security clearance?  And it sounds like yes you would want someone with a security clearance to convey that message.  >We're doing everything we can to contain the north korean nuclear threat >>Like what? >>>I have no idea.  I only know what I've read in the newspapers.  Do you know?
t1_ducjynt	1	*	Mexico is already a big manufacturing and trading hub, and if they can cut down on the corruption and cartel bullshit, they can grow huge.  Mexico has trade agreements with like 120+ countries.  Its located in the middle of the Americas and close enough to Europe, Africa, and also Asia.  They can produce a ton of products and be faster to most markets than China can, and without China's bullshit policies.
t1_due03id	1	*	What's this savings card thing all about? Fiancxe9 is on some expensive meds and I'm curious if they'd be included
t1_dur11tg	1	*	For me it's quite an easy line to trace. Pre-Melinda: git. Post-Melinda: nice person trying to do good things.  Melinda deserves a ton of credit and recognition.
t1_duml1f1	1	*	Were they trying to sell alcohol? Because a lot of restaurants do that. They don't strip but they go around each table to recommend types of alcohol, lol. 
t1_dubbqcj	0	*	Don't eat the snow then.
t1_dunemnf	1	*	Did she have any education? What were her two jobs?
t1_dui8ieo	1	*	Your absolutely right. So the fact he says this shit, but doesnt do anything about it, means he doesnt give a shit really.  But it really up to us poor people to demand equality 
t1_dugx0wp	1	*	..... what? 
t1_duefpmb	1	*	They will probably still travel there with false documents though. So difficult to actually arrest them unless there is some facial recognition involved. 
t1_dul8514	0	*	Also just so people know, that's *usually* the case, but not always. Religious class in Ireland is very unstructured, so it's sort of up to the teachers/board what to teach.
t1_duvrhsb	0	*	Why is China not included?
t1_dus1ocd	1	*	People want water view homes
t1_duafh8g	0	*	They are not taking their oil. They have exclusive rights to rebuild the infrastructure and train the people that will man it.  
t1_ducxync	1	*	Whataboutism  Most of the time though this is just pointing out hypocrisy. Some people say some crazy shit but it does seem like everyone on reddit is pretty hypocritical. 
t1_dugu130	1	*	Both of our candidates were utter shit.
t1_dulvtp0	1	*	I prefer meme warfare to nuclear warfare
t1_duqw75l	1	*	Because someone pleaded guilty for crimes committed before working for Trump?
t1_duambb1	0	*	Nope. Also, cover your nads.
t1_dusvf8l	1	*	Ya ok sure.
t1_duuqoqg	1	*	The person leading in the polls right now is quite literally a Fascist who's trying to follow in the steps of Mussolini, so I'd be very happy John Oliver won instead.
t1_dufyd9j	1	*	Click bait funds in depth investigation. It's a sound business model
t1_dum7na2	1	*	SWEET SAUCE
t1_dupqhr4	0	*	Otherwise known as socialism!
t1_dugmcuv	0	*	Worst part is, he thinks this is clever and people will not realize what the phrasing means...
t1_dulkal8	1	*	>Only cops need guns  In many countries where guns are illegal most cops don't even have guns.
t1_duid0it	1	*	But what about baby jesus?~!
t1_duwq29l	1	*	> Dr salaries   What doctors are salaried by the government?  My GP is a private business who just charges the bill to OHIP.  
t1_dueo7wa	1	*	Yes me too! My family comes from Tzintzuntzan, which means place of the hummingbirds in Purepecha. It's almost certain  I'm part Purepecha because of this, since it used to once be their capital city.
t1_duzk904	1	*	If it was a movie America would send a team of skilled but unorthodox ex military personnel, under the guise of a vacation, to extract them.
t1_dut2r1y	1	*	We already know exactly what's there, it's getting somebody there and back that is the challenge and the achievement.   It's more about developing the technology to go further afield in the future.
t1_duagc71	0	*	Does antibiotic resistance have anything to do with these dangerous and virulent flu strains, though? Flus are all viruses, so not impacted by antibiotics or antibiotic resistance, right? Not to downplay the antibiotic overuse because that's a ticking time bomb as well... Just that I think the issue with some of these flu strains is just humans living in close (and unclean) proximity to animals.
t1_dunhlhe	1	*	It worked on you. 
t1_dum91xh	1	*	That's right cotton. The NSA and American government may actually use the Minix backdoor to remotely redirect the missiles.
t1_dur6ods	1	*	This comes from an online survey with over 2000 answers.  Enough said.
t1_duyji17	1	*	Not necessarily no. 
t1_duf5xld	1	*	Why don't they set up mushroom farms right next to the cow farms?
t1_duqvcnn	1	*	Well always be this primal at the core, until weve bred it out of our genes or modified our brains with tech.
t1_duje9iv	1	*	Holocaust was very efficient because of the vivid and widespread jewish collaboation and passivity.  Jews killed not only Jews, but Soviet Jewish partisans were responsible for many massacres and plundering of polish villages.  If Israel is a nationalistic chauvinistic state which cannot deal with it's past they cannot blame Poland for that.
t1_dutx267	0	*	You know how big the ocean is, right?
t1_dui7jv7	1	*	Yeah, I've never seen anyone that says they should pay more taxes actually ever do this. i'm thinking if they did, it would be big news and we'd all hear about it.
t1_duqw9z1	1	*	More like point out all these crimes were from before he worked on the trump campaign
t1_dupeyrn	0	*	>Fuck military and protectionism   Is it fun being dependent on the US? Eternally inferior?  No one respects a country with a weak military. If you are not feared you are nothing.  Face the facts. Only thing that works ik the world is brute force.  And last time i checked the US is still the richest country on the planet. And its not becuase of some solar panels and some hippie junk.  Its becuase of bombs, missiles and oil.  War brings prosperity. 
t1_duk54ou	1	*	Which makes up a tiny portion of trade. Russia has been biggest trade partner of Ukraine for a while now...
t1_dub2g1j	0	*	a corporation has no country, other than for tax purposes.
t1_duc64l1	0	*	I'm imagining a news cartoon of 2 white Americans complaining about foreigners buying an expensive home and driving up the prices of the area.  Then the same Americans in the Philipines buying up coastal property to build luxury hotels that only cater to foreigners.  When they do it, BOOO!  When you do it, It improves the economy of the locals!
t1_ducljmg	0	*	I just went through our fridge and blacklisted stuff with palm oil in it. Also you can donate to willy smitts Orang utan sanctuary in borneo, the site is in dutch iirc edit : this one  http://www.soc.or.id/ 
t1_duuw3to	1	*	Good coffee doesn't need sugar ;)
t1_dur7lqw	1	*	The internet is great for that because its distributed across the whole world.
t1_duuu161	1	*	What isn't these days, fascist?
t1_duw7002	1	*	That would leave us with like A cop still alive per city, and none in Baltimore.
t1_duj9r06	1	*	Home=Country in that sense the statement is correct
t1_duvz43n	1	*	The US also arms most of the world. Europe, Australia, Asia, the ME, Africa and South America.   The choice was between soviet manufacturers or the US for large scale millitary purchases and the US took over when the USSR died almost completely. Germany cant really compete in their current state and theyr ereally the closest competitors.
t1_dum4lus	1	*	Yep. This is more accurate. He has always been paranoid about the CIA and thinks they'll assassinate him.
t1_duru2qj	1	*	Last year we had some very warm days. I remember moving on February 17th and was wearing t-shirt and shorts.
t1_duoo3k9	0	*	DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY!
t1_duu681n	1	*	America has a longstanding, even foundational strain paranoia. Even people who believe in big government dont necessarily trust the government to do things like mandatory vaccination.   However, there should be a core set of vaccines mandatory for public school. Sure, you dont have to get the flu vaccine. But there are some we shouldnt budge on. 
t1_duhpuxv	1	*	The refugees say South Korea is definitely not safe for them as North Korean spies can track them down.  If we're found by the North Korean government, our family left in North Korea will be executed or sent to a labour camp, Kim said.
t1_duaedin	1	*	Typical Guardian misrepresentation.
t1_duxvvtj	1	*	It wasn't so long ago when the Supreme Dictator had people arrested [just for being happy](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-29272732).

t1_dusuheg	1	*	You meant executing not exorcism 
t1_dulnmcw	1	*	> 3,671 points (89% upvoted)  I agree. This thread did not get many upvotes at all.
t1_dup3soo	1	*	Their loss
t1_dul1l0o	1	*	Of course they don't feel good, but when it comes to third world countries with hilariously sad health systems - if you even want to call them so- - I think that promoting unsafe sex is not the smartest thing to do. On the other hand, Darwin.
t1_dum64td	0	*	But will it be good for bitcoin?
t1_dugbap7	1	*	Brushing the ice requires strength. Doping makes you stronger --> better brusher. 
t1_duc110r	1	*	Jakarta has plans for lots of things. They announced the start of badly-needed mass rail transit and incinerators back in the 90's. Still waiting.
t1_duazk0y	1	*	A lot of people genuinely like Putin in Russia. Both those that benefit from his reign and those who find him appealing for whatever reasons. A lot of these rogue groups do have cooperation with government officials though.
t1_duc0fo6	1	*	What would you recommend for Southern Florida?
t1_duqqm02	1	*	They can pry their guns from our cold, dead, invisible hand.
t1_duglqx0	0	*	The issue lies in the fact that google has nearly monopolized the search engine industry. Google prioritizing their own services next to any other competitors will mean they can continuously grow their company to the point where it legitimately is a monopoly. It is kind of disingenuous for a search engine to prioritize their assets first over any other.  Google has become so incredibly powerful and renowned that the common phrasing is now just google it as opposed to just use a search engine 
t1_dum8mzo	1	*	> that might invade America like Red Dawn  That is what the American propaganda made us look like. In reality, most Russians thought America was this magical land of riches, where everyone can get what they want. 
t1_dug4zum	0	*	Why would that picture make them stop? It's what they see every time it's performed. C'est la vie and it's what the fathers parents did to him, like done to his father. It's just the way things are done 
t1_dubmlme	0	*	Bullshit.  Just watch one of the NRA's commercials and tell me just how humanizing they are regarding liberals. 
t1_duup95c	1	*	East Vietnamese Sea. 
t1_duji7w7	0	*	Depends what you mean by meddling. 80 Russians trolls posting on social media is not exactly meddling in any formal sense. No voting machines were hacked, ballet boxes stuffed or people forced to vote for Putin's choice.
t1_duw7ll6	0	*	It's almost as if China has a tightly controlled domestic press so we have to rely on outside sources.
t1_duhhh84	0	*	Did you read the article?  *Sea ice melting does not contribute directly to sea-level rise. Watch an ice cube melt in a glass of water. The water level wont rise.*
t1_durj56f	0	*	Meanwhile, it's snowing on Vancouver Island. Shit's fucked yo.
t1_dunuumb	1	*	In the USA? The country where diasporian post-WWII European immigrants flocked to imported bottled water like sliced bread during the 1970s because their homelands' water sources were so filthy they couldn't drink tap water and invented a brand new landfill item in a country where they *could* drink tap water
t1_dukzpo3	1	*	Their blueshirts though, are set to kill.
t1_dusp89m	1	*	I'd have liked to have seen that too :-)
t1_duhnciq	1	*	I didn't know New Orleans was in Florida.
t1_dubkj5v	1	*	I love true stories!
t1_dud656p	0	*	Skyscrapers are hard to build without access to steel-reinforced concrete.
t1_duqalwv	1	*	>Widespread rent control  Huh, Economists and YIMBY millennials are the one's who want to see rent control die; I doubt you'll find many conservatives among them.  I'd imagine calling Paul Krugman a conservative to his face would be construed as fighting words by him: http://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/07/opinion/reckonings-a-rent-affair.html
t1_duy3k88	1	*	Just like the Bullet Club?
t1_dui0hkl	1	*	... And you wonder why corporations love helping poor immigrants fleeing their countries so much. /snark
t1_durfzon	0	*	I feel like I was born too late to make a difference, but I realise if I was born earlier I wouldn't of known I had to.
t1_dupdpxu	0	*	Macron kept shitting on Trump after he was elected. Called RT and sputnik propaganda tools while standing a meter away from Putin too.  
t1_duk69rc	0	*	If I remember, the plan was to name it Trump Forest partly to make fun of Trump, but also to play on his vanity to get him to support it since it has his name on it.
t1_duykjv5	1	*	WHEN???? I CAN'T WAIT ANY LONGER! 
t1_dul6gfy	1	*	When I was in secondary school we could either pay attention to the teacher in religion class or do our homework. In fact many just choose to go out and play football instead. Generally the topics were more about philosophy and morality than religion anyway.   Strict is certainly not a word I would have associated with religion classes. Obviously though people that went to different schools will have had different experiences.
t1_dues24x	1	*	What if Russia issues them fake passports? Fingerprints apparently can be changed, how would you prevent that? It's not like CIA agents travel with their own personal passports.
t1_dusqbtc	0	*	The difference is that the romans killed Christians around 1700 years ago. It's 2018 now (in case you forgot) and Pakistan is actively murdering everyone who is not a muslim. Even then, they're murdering people who are muslims, but not the state approved kind.   So yeah, Rome is acknowledging that Pakistan's state-sponsored murders are super messed up.
t1_duncdo6	0	*	Except Bio-Degradable single use items are scams. 
t1_dugj6mo	1	*	It's not about a certain brand being toxic. It's about cleaning chemicals in general being bad for your lungs and that it has long term effects on your health, breathing them in.    For example; you clean your windows, you use windows cleaner, you spray it on the glass but you can also smell and taste the spay in the air, you breathe it in, you damage your lungs a tiny bit and over the years that ads up    (please excuse my formatting) 
t1_dup2yre	0	*	It's not a movie. 
t1_dum4c42	0	*	>Japan would be better of using the $7.5 million to literally do anything else but this. What a sham.  If you see how much money Japan wasted in Cambodia hoping for some business opportunities, you wouldn't be surprised about this tiny amount of $7.5m
t1_dutpcm6	0	*	Most of us are good people I think, people that is, not Americans specifically; which is not to say I believe our, or any nation is an exception to that idea.  I think cultural imprinting is a huge factor in how people interact, but also consider that youre typically dealing with a different socioeconomic class than is representative of the majority of the US. Also nice stories just dont grab the attention like an apparent threat. But also, fuck this guy. 
t1_duc52gi	1	*	No, this person gives millions to New York state every year.
t1_dumvpd2	0	*	man, imagine how they could feel if its all wasted, and democracy reaffirms itself. russia just educated hundreds of people to how shitty russia is and how powerful democratic institutions can be.  putin is brave to pay citizens to expose themselves to democracy
t1_duvi034	1	*	Take your upvote.
t1_dudvci1	0	*	Just need a Russian to enter the mix and US tax dollars will flow again.
t1_duo80al	0	*	Name a single school shooting that wasn't ended by a gun? Either the student shoots himself when other guns arrive, is killed by other guns, or apprehended by people with other guns. The solution always is and always has been a gun. The only issue at stake is whether or not you want to wait more or less time for the situation to be resolved.
t1_dujx8r2	1	*	It sounds like he wants an army of mini mes and he is a batshit crazy millionaire with the means to care for them. While it is weird I can't say that the children will suffer for it so I can really say it's wrong. Living in luxery apartments with 24/7 nannies is a better childhood than many people get while definitely unique.
t1_dunh3qs	1	*	Strong!    Skill, on the other hand... Lacking.
t1_ducby6h	0	*	Do you agree then that giving tax breaks to those who *already* have enough money is also wrong? 
t1_duxnv4m	0	*	This is literally orientalism.
t1_duh0151	1	*	Im conservative. This is not what I fucking wanted.
t1_duymh5s	1	*	Anyone who thinks this ongoing, 2 year old investigation that has ultimately found nothing worthwhile or creditable is total bullshit is A RUSSIAN!    The Russian propaganda was meant to destabilize and divide the American people, did it ever occur to you that these breaking news articles from unnamed sources might be designed by them to continue that mission of division into trumps second year? Maybe YOU'RE the russian!
t1_duk0qti	0	*	Isn't that lawyering 101? Don't ask questions you don't already know answers to? I'm sure there are exceptions of course.

t1_dun96sp	1	*	You might need geography lessons. 
t1_dupfpsz	0	*	Given Germany's colorful history I don't doubt their ability to whip up a fully functional military in short notice if the need arose. I think most countries are smart enough to avoid reliving history.
t1_dul2ag5	1	*	That was...unprovoked...
t1_duynk8t	0	*	Many atheists love to believe that a world without religion would be a better one. As an atheist myself, I think that that view is very naive. Religion is not the disease. It's a symptom. If religion were to completely disappear from society, you think people would stop being dicks/cunts. The powerful will find another trivial distinction along which society would be divided as a  way to manipulate people for power.
t1_duxouci	1	*	Maybe you could feel better if you helped the ocean. The biggest threat to marine wildlife is over fishing and by-kill. Basically, the nets that are meant for fish end up catching sharks, dolphins, and whales too. The ecosystems are suffering because too many fish are being removed.  So what you can do to help is to stop eating seafood. 
t1_dunbpb8	0	*	Bread bowls and that cool edible bread cutlery

t1_duw55v6	1	*	even if he didnt have a weapon
t1_duj28py	0	*	What a generalisation. All gays are squeaky clean and organised and all straight men live dirty. When you say this do you not follow your pc regime?
t1_dufegee	0	*	You could go to the restroom, sit on the toilet, and let it all out.  Or you could sit between multiple strangers proudly covering them all in your stink as you loudly let out each fart bit by bit.
t1_dux7pg5	0	*	Get assault glue guns off our streets! 
t1_dugbh9k	1	*	If you want to help them so bad why dont you accept some to stay with you? They are not refugees, they are economic migrants. Which doesnt make them bad people, but no sane country will allow people to settler in their country without proper due process.
t1_dujkgv1	0	*	Proof that the Russian propaganda works.  Anything criticising Trump or going against his politics is hate.  Fascism 101.
t1_duz1s5m	1	*	Those all happen, but are also highly illegal.    It's a system with harsh laws that are selectively enforced.
t1_duhir75	1	*	Mine Kormf

t1_dut9ytz	1	*	Later he went down to a member of Lower Chamber of the State Duma and failed attempt to become a major. In 2003 elections his party - Union of Right Forces wasnt able to pass 5% barrier. In 2013 he became a member of a regional duma (Yaroslavl). He was a sole member of his party there.
t1_duuriee	1	*	No.

t1_duqab0x	1	*	Why would the Russians support Trump when Hillary was so supportive of them?
t1_dujmtvi	0	*	Most successful businesses aren't run like this either.  People leave jobs because of shitty bosses like him.  Unless you've got a particularly great mission, like Space X, you don't get away with treating people like crap and underpaying them for long.
t1_dua9zmd	1	*	Yes, I also saw this tweet. 
t1_dustcv7	1	*	Americans will pay for it. What could be more patriotic than giving up a substantial portion of your pension for such a noble cause?
t1_dunpxv7	0	*	Trump has been actively undermining press freedom by threatening the press corps with locking them out of certain events, calling factual news sources fake news.  Not to mention undermining the integrity of the entire justice system. When a person in power uses their platform to erode trust in the press and justice system when they are just doing their jobs they are actively undermining these basic rights. 
t1_duvgi79	1	*	Yeah I think its unfair to blame this on mass tourism, its more the islands ineptitude 
t1_duco3p4	1	*	what was the energy drink you were addicted to?
t1_dugrabv	1	*	Why yes, yes it was.
t1_duaebk6	0	*	They only took over Crimea, East Ukraine and Ossetia!  Come on, give peaceful Russia a break. Invading two sovereign nations without warning and expanding their territory is what all peace loving countries do. You should be more worried about the US. Think about all the bad things the US did in the 70s, and definitely not about all the international crimes and warfare Russia is committing right now. 
t1_dupli5x	1	*	Not spend it on defense, just rip off the USA for defending them for free

t1_dupbyk0	0	*	Lebanon is already quite progressive.

t1_dur2zdy	0	*	I wanted to bring up this concern but thought I'd get flak for it. I don't think we should be medicating for these kind of low level conditions.

t1_dut9z1k	1	*	In all honesty, I think were looking at another world war in the next few years. This is exactly how shit played out 4 generations ago, and were apparently not breaking this weird cycle in this generation. Thankfully, the Millennials are going to taking over soon, so if this war doesnt nuke us all into Mad Max land, we can look forward to some real positive change when the dust settles.  But yeah, it seems we never, ever learn from history.  May you live in interesting times.

t1_dudt36g	1	*	Clinton was the wrong candidate without doubt. 30 years of attacks from the right-wing has left them despised by a decent chunk of the population.  With that being said, the total nuber of votes that decided the 3 key states was ~77,000. I have no doubts that Russian propaganda helped push some voters over to Trump and it didn't need many to impact the result.

t1_duu3u8t	1	*	Russia.
t1_dud41wb	1	*	To be clear, Rosenstein purposefully intended to convey that these specific allegations are not meant to inform anyone as to whether Trump or his people are implicated or not. If they are, that would be a separate set of indictments at a later stage. If they are not, we'll find out when they formally announce an end to their investigation. 
t1_duix954	1	*	Youre wrong about this. People cared this much because the victims are Muslims. Myanmar junta has been committing these atrocious acts over other minority ethnics who were largely Christians for decades now. It never received worldwide attention like this.

You can buy two $8 bottles in any drug store and have all you need for a month.  This drug maker is just ripping off insurance companies and governments with the complicity of corrupt or ignorant doctors.

t1_dul9ajk	1	*	To be fair I had straight up Christian doctrine, thought by the woman who was also the science teacher. This was only 15 years ago. 
t1_duvn1tf	0	*	The headlines are getting more extreme because 1) people become desensitized. Now that storms like Katrina and Irma have happened, it's gonna take something even bigger to get peoples attention, and 2) because people aren't listening, at all, this is a Earth shatteringly big deal, literally if the Arctic ice is gone, nothing can protect us from the 1000s of gigatonnes of deep Arctic methane, Earth will microwave as a result.

Oh look, it also seems that the Philippines has a civil war that left thousands dead. Maybe they'll escape pandemic, but who knows. 
t1_dul4din	1	*	That and non-Russian citizens likely. Did you see the video and the transcript? It's a comedy sketch that isn't trying to fear monger and doesn't mention any candidate. This article is the actual propaganda.

t1_duwl0cr	0	*	Sovereignty was killed with the creation of a central bank. And good riddance.    The only sovereignty that would make me happy is a world government. This country stuff has brought but problems for the last few millennia. It's time to grow out of it.
t1_dudo11l	1	*	Geologist here. There's that much distance between Alaska and Mexico (even as the crow flies, never mind following the plate boundary) that there wouldn't be any relationship between the two quakes.  As for prepping for earthquakes, it is Seattle. It's the US West Coast. Earthquake prediction is probability and guesswork at the best of times, but given Seattle's proximity to a major convergent plate boundary, it probably wouldn't hurt to have some supplies for in case of an earthquake.

t1_dugra84	1	*	I believe it was, however I think his advisors know just how damaging this could be on an international scale and so are opting for 'damage control.' It will be interesting to see what Trump does about this, but I can completely understand why his advisors saying what they are.

t1_dunfsri	1	*	Thats exactly what Trump, Breitbard and Murdoch have done. And you fell for it apparently.

t1_duhbc0l	0	*	Despite proof of corruption over and over, his base remains committed to supporting him.   Don't you see an issue in a regulatory body having to teach an electorate that corruption is a bad thing? That multiple leaders need to be removed from power, rather then being voted out.
t1_duostnd	1	*	Another thought is that if Brazil gets more incentive to grow corn, the world will lose more and more rainforest habitat and might face more species die offs due to surges in agriculture.

t1_dutg29g	1	*	They can't. Even if they don't get shot. How far will a simple fishing boat get? They'll have to either dock in Israel or in Egypt, and that's exactly why Israeli and Egyptian ships are monitoring the border.

t1_duqldvn	0	*	Did you read the actual charges?    They are simple enough and if you read them with any honesty at all, while illegal, even a rabid leftist would not consider the crimes, Treason.     Do you just use the word, or do you know what it means?

t1_duybh4v	1	*	You're right, and many of the replies here are a combination of entitlement where personal taste is absolutely non-negotiable regardless of the cost, and spiteful reacting to someone who dared to suggest that we should consume less in today's abysmal economic paradigm.
t1_dus8lzy	0	*	Now? You could give that designation to Assad 7 years ago.

t1_dubmrgz	1	*	> I'm beginning to wonder if Russia even intends to support a particular American party at all. What if they're just trying to rally support for whatever policy will weaken our nation and divide us?  Russians don't give a shit about Donald Trump. They support him precisely because they know his presidency hurts our nation and for no other reason. 
t1_dupe6k0	1	*	Yeah but stupid stable ... that's a whole new concept.

t1_dujhj1l	1	*	Ah come on. All he did was forget that he was in a supermarket and not at work when he tried to cheat people... It's an innocent mistake. ;\)
t1_duv6dg7	1	*	Not really the first one. 10 years ago a reporter disappeared. They haven't found him yet. Probably at bottom of a lake or river.

t1_dul8csq	1	*	This guy seems like a sack of shit.
t1_dufqggz	1	*	Fir the past decades most parts were blocked, also paying for parts were close to impossible until recently because of the sanctions and SWIFT ban. I am not sure about this plane in particular. 
t1_dudngi1	1	*	This article is specially about the opposite though.  People are identifying grills correctly instead of loosing their shit.    How about giving some thoughts to that instead of making things worse?
t1_duprqrw	1	*	I agree violence is not the way to fight back against the wave of nationalist aspirational fascists. But don't think for a second the other side isn't fully enamored by that violence. Tell the kids at Parkland about political debate when the MAGA madman stormed in with an AR-15.
t1_duyi6az	0	*	Someone tell me if this has something to do with the pee tape? That would be so epic. 
t1_duhelh2	1	*	Cause the us government, or rather the entire us political system has devolved in a soap opera. Im a european but this shit is juicer than any soap opera
t1_duq733j	0	*	Im surprised, as an outsider, that more US citizens are not worried about what happened to their democracy, and what is currently still happening. You have essentially lost your sovereignty without realising it. 
t1_dui193x	1	*	Dad! Just let them do their job.
t1_dukumcb	1	*	Yes I think it's factually a correct statement. I hate condoms, too. It's just politically not the best message to push given the state of HIV in his country.
t1_duslhdj	1	*	No, they won't. That is not happening. No matter how much you want to spin that Mexico is paying for our border security it just will not become a reality.

t1_duh97h8	1	*	It seems like Manafort and other aides/advisors may go under the bus and take the fall to protect trump. Is that a possibility that Trump walks away from this despite finding proof linking his *direct* advisors?
t1_dui06vv	0	*	Source?
t1_duteeol	0	*	It's even more surprising since Turkey's justice system is a joke: They just released a German journalist after holding him for a year without even charging him of a crime. Add to that his crime is sedition, which you can technically slap on any Kurd, and he's not even a citizen of Turkey, but Syria. This should be against EU's extradition rules.

t1_dutd8js	0	*	Human demand will always outweigh ecological or natural benefit. Most people dont give a shit if the oceans or any of its species suffer if it means getting good-tasting fish. I know a majority of people in these stats fish because its their livelihood, but I think a fair amount of it is wasteful.

t1_duvjj56	1	*	Yes, he was arrested Feb 25th, but the sign in the window Jan 28th says    = the police is waiting for us, so weren't they arrested on that day, too? The court then convicted him for repeated violation of the public assembly rules ([according to OVD-Info](https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ru&tl=en&js=y&prev=_t&hl=fi&ie=UTF-8&u=https%3A%2F%2Fovdinfo.org%2Fexpress-news%2F2018%2F02%2F25%2Fv-peterburge-aktivista-vesny-ostavlyayut-v-ovd-do-suda-iz-za-performansa-s&edit-text=)).

t1_duj1nv2	1	*	Shit, there are still American cities where this is still an issue. There are millions of Americans that refuse to cohabitate with gay people, as sad as that is.   But, of course, its *wayyyyyyy* more severe (or common, maybe) in Russia. You can be jailed for gay propoganda. As a queer woman Im not going to even get close to Russia for that reason, despite the fact that Ive travelled pretty extensively.

t1_dumre4y	0	*	I don't think anyone suggesting we arm teachers means we should *force* them to do it.  But yes, this article highlights one of the biggest barriers to allowing teachers to carry.

t1_duv62ov	0	*	On my first trip to Bali (2002), I saw two guys drive their truck down on a river bank to do an oil change..  the truck stood in a couple of inches of water and they emptied the oil right in the water. This was about a mile or two from the ocean which the river led to.  Without proper knowledge and infrastructure, the pollution will continue.  
t1_duuxl3o	1	*	Sort of, global climate change models predict more extremes and changes. People saying Global warming is true because look how warm it is here, are wrong, but people saying Global climate change is true because of all the extreme changes and this is an example of one, are right.  https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/does-climate-change-cause-extreme-weather-events-180964506/

So unless Iran was planning on building a 50,000+ ton warship, a nuclear powered ship is only going to cripple their defense budget for no good reason.

t1_dunrq8g	1	*	What about the killings of suspects without a trial or even due cause?  We are living in a police state more and more each day...
t1_duwz1ec	1	*	Yeah but you forget the part where you gotta fight for it. Or else hope is just wishful thinking.
t1_dul6j67	0	*	Amazing how you losers are always blaming The Republicans for Obama's limp-dicked presidency, yet for 8 fucking years Dems and lefty voters were too busy putting things in each other's asses and crying about white people to go out and vote annually and in midterms to get more people from their side into positions that mattered. Can't blame Republicans for the Dems and their eternal lazy, creampuff nature.

t1_dujrw5r	1	*	Highly recommend Nothing is True and Everything is Possible. Actually heard about it on reddit and just finished reading it. It really captures the current perversion of public opinion in Russia.

t1_duyat4j	1	*	You can bet your ass that western governments, especially the US, have been using this for years.  The entire purpose of institutions like the NSA is to do exactly this.  China is simply open about it while the West either hides their activities or uses parallel construction.

t1_dug1snq	1	*	Many Iranian airlines are banned due to safety concerns, which are in part caused by the sanctions on the airlines by the United States. So the planes are less safe because they can't get replacement parts easily, and in turn, they aren't allowed to land at European Airports. Sadly, when they land at these airports they receive routine maintenance anyway, so unfortunately they get hit doubly hard by the ban.

t1_duu88xy	0	*	The average global temperature compared to 80 years ago is less than 1 degree difference.

t1_dufh44d	1	*	I could never figure out why these news outlets (who had clearly picked the Democrats as their preferred party) were talking about how much damage the email leaks were causing, while neglecting why they were damaging. Surely their preferred candidate didn't possibly have any shady business hidden in them.
t1_dujt2ne	1	*	I wonder how many russian nationals are grabbing their passports this morning
t1_duf5bis	1	*	This ain't the US. Lol
t1_duthf25	1	*	We've immunised against smallpox, it's extinct. We immunise against polio, that's almost extinct.  Sadly, your views aren't.
t1_duwnk1j	1	*	Thankfully in America we have a free market healthcare system and Doctors aren't the ones paying nurses. Each hospital's administration can decide on the market value of everyone's skills. Some specialized nurses can make more than doctors
t1_dul675g	1	*	almost all better put that foil hat on

t1_duwudb6	1	*	They should tho
t1_dumle6u	0	*	If you don't want to be as clueless and conspiracy theorized as the rest of this website, do yourself a huge favor and don't look any further into where most of the shills on Reddit get their news and ideas from.

t1_durpb1b	1	*	It will end sooner than later.  Other states now face the fact that pot is flowing into their state from other legal states. 
t1_duptbto	1	*	Shove it right in our faces across the pond by increasing Medicare benefits, education, infrastructure, and renewable energy.  Meanwhile our idiot politicians has been doing nothing but increase their own wealth.  
t1_dugi1yh	0	*	Youd think, but I get the feeling that the GOP views his Twitter tantrums as a benefit.  The GOP can chip away at our democratic institutions, funnel tax payers money to their donors and remove the environmental regulations to maximize profit while Trump serves as the lightning rod to attract all the hate, disgust and outrage. 
t1_dugs4pj	1	*	Yeah we know he's a problem. Just don't wanna cause any miscommunication errors with a problematic leader.
t1_duw25jt	0	*	I think the saying is The long-term spoils of the wonderous Universe do not go to a plague of intelligence-destroying parasitic apes.
t1_duj47so	1	*	Doublethink
t1_due5oef	1	*	This is the case i dont think they will have a harder time than before either. Probably laughing at this.
t1_dul487k	1	*	That's...  Not really much different than what Americans do on their own, already.
t1_duygel7	0	*	I completely agree with the fact that this shit is horrible and that Japan should be ashamed of itself, however:    What about other countries? Armies of all countries have raped women. Have these people EVER been compensated? Were these kind of war victims ever recognized?  For example: American soldiers raping Vietnamese civilians during the Vietnam war was considered standard practice. Did the US ever formally apologized for its war crimes? Have Vietnamese families ever been compensated?
t1_duj25x8	1	*	Fellow hoser here, can confirm.    
t1_duyvguu	1	*	They are probably talking about the *concept* of a supermarket focused on being plastic-free. That likely is a world's first. But, whatever. Good on them.

t1_ducse5m	0	*	Yeah, really. Especially the hacking part ... which is where exactly?
t1_duykpzs	0	*	I still contemplate how different the election would have been if Bernie Sanders won in the primaries.
t1_duyxtms	1	*	To second the other commenter, almost all of these are actually industrially compostable, which is unfortunate if you want to be able to compost at home, but a step in the right direction imo!
t1_dulwh3z	1	*	Somewhere below 10 tall(500ml) 5% beers.
t1_duz09o3	1	*	The CIA seized uranium from some arms dealers in eastern Europe. The uranium may have originally been stolen from Russia. Russian authorities requested a sample of the uranium to perform a forensic analysis. Mueller then personally delivered a ten gram sample to them so that they could perform this analysis. This is usually called diplomacy and law enforcement.  There is nothing nefarious here in the slightest.
t1_duu3hzm	1	*	I put a list of every manga I'm reading on Google Drive. Do you think China judges me for my smut? 
t1_dur1vzd	1	*	But well explained in the comments. Thank you.

t1_dujg8o5	1	*	Let them eat cake.
t1_duhsen1	1	*	Honestly my first thought was that the Welsh were behind it

t1_duwlnez	1	*	Cap and trade bruh
t1_duphfox	0	*	The germans here are saying its because they jacked up taxes and has nothing to do with the military.  Ironic
t1_due5vpb	0	*	I hope they think that way.  From an extradition treaty standpoint they can only go to like 4 countries including Russia. 
t1_dudi8ic	0	*	Perhaps they should go back to policing their internet and keeping naughty porn from their citizens' innocent eyes. 
t1_duelilg	0	*	I would not want to see another revolution in our day and age... during the French Revolution it was the highly intellectual elite starting it all.   Today it would be started by the hillbillies... Dey dook a derps...

t1_dutx5d9	1	*	You are a dope.
t1_dul8juy	0	*	IIRC, wasn't he forced out about 20 years ago owing to a corruption scandal of some sort or another? I seem to recall that some time in the 1990's. I know he was PM at some point in the '90s but I could swear he resigned. I remember being surprised at his political re-emergence; I figured he was finished back in the day. 
t1_dulhhq7	1	*	Do they teach about The Flying Spaghetti Monster? 
t1_duxo9ax	0	*	Here in Massachusetts, the vegetation is acting like it's April.  Historically, the last freeze is almost always late April or May (May 1 on average). It's February, but it's only been below freezing one night in the last eight days. The plants are quite confused.  I'm holding off doing any planting for now. It would seem insane for me to try to plant anything before mid-April, but we'll see.
t1_dujuqdm	1	*	Why would you shit a brick and turn yourself in if u did nothing wrong?
t1_dutmcgk	1	*	Ha.  Planet shopping...  Oh wait, you're serious.

t1_dut825c	1	*	But Trump said they would.  He said it a LOT.  It was kind of his main thing.  Surely theyll feel bad for him and just do it to save him politically as he continues to publicly shit talk them. 
t1_durj58p	0	*	Normal dudes thrown into a meat-grinder for no good reason.
t1_duegdzs	1	*	Frankly I doubt my country (Finland) would extradite them if they were to visit
t1_dugbu5e	0	*	I only steal since Bell doesn't release films on schedule
t1_duct9gk	1	*	On Reddit it's quite a bit different.  Because of the share mechanics of the website they don't actually have to say anything usually.  They just have to find an opinion that is pro-Russian and upvote it to the top, and then downvote anti-Russian opinions. 
t1_dup9esh	0	*	Erik Prince the founder of Blackwater is her brother, not husband.
t1_dug2944	0	*	Gipsy Danger will protect us.
t1_duql7y7	1	*	Its not blackmail it is snitching. Little fish gives up the big fish in hopes Manafort will incriminate Trump directly or by association.
t1_dubzfjv	1	*	Or maybe the US government is pushing the demonization of russia (which they technically never stopped) to get consent for future actions based on their current goal of taking their gas market from europe, (financially ruining russia) which is also what US sanctions on EU and russia are about and the whole assad thing. Long story short, $$$  Making russia look bad and discredit political opponents = 2 birds one strike
t1_dusl4po	1	*	Yes because people will be lining up to flee to Mexico...let me get the number to your weedman I need what you be smokin on.
t1_duda3dh	1	*	Wow, looks like your username is actually pretty relevant.
t1_dupaqc5	1	*	The embassy didn't do it.   It was somebody who tried to use it to ship it to Europe/Russia. 
t1_dupirmx	0	*	How is me keeping more of my money I earned through hard work  bad ?  Germany has absurdely high taxes in everything. It makes people dependent on the state. The wellfare- state is absolutely ENORMOUS in germany.  For this reason the average german household has a much lower Net-worth than most other households in the EU.  Greeks are literally richer than germans. Oh the Irony...
t1_duv0kdw	0	*	Just stay away where white people or Australians go
t1_dux80w5	0	*	Environmentalist.. lol. Have you seen the condition environmentalists leave their protest zones.
t1_duw367r	0	*	> 87% of the wood is not certified but that doesn't mean they all come from rainforests.  If I was getting my wood from somewhere other than a rainforest, why wouldn't I get it certified? Then I could (presumably) sell it at a premium.  What's the incentive for selling certifiable wood at non-certifiable prices?
t1_dut4wvm	1	*	The perpetrators were granted immunity by the American gov/army in exchange for the data gathered. None of this information was shared with the rest of the allies. That is in itself a crime; allowing crimes against humanity to go unpunished and to profit from them. 
t1_dueu8ud	1	*	An end...obviously 
t1_duih7o0	1	*	You guys still have radios?
t1_duui2kk	1	*	corruption <3
t1_duuv697	0	*	It is a power consolidation, but it is primarily a wealth consolidation. For years the war in Yemen and strain of lower oil prices have diminished what was at one time considered the limitless wealth of the House of Saud. This string of anti\-corruption cases against over 50 Saudi royals is as much about reclaiming wealth, as it is about showing some of the world's richest men that they are not above the law in the KSA.
t1_duprmnc	1	*	You still are.

t1_dunn3no	0	*	^ This guy has never signed a contract in his life. I give him a D- on his business acumen. 2 years is ridiculously short for a global company of its size.
t1_duh7kau	1	*	The investigation is to investigate Russian interference. If he did nothing wrong he'll have nothing to worry about. But his defensive stance and his fear of falling out of Putin's grace shouts  I'm Guilty, I'm a Russian Puppet!
t1_dut4gls	1	*	Was the same thoughts on trees in the USA. And then the Civil War needed fuel for the trains...

t1_duvcvzv	1	*	It's run by al-Assad and his henchmen. They are as stupid as they are brutal. Serves the Russians well to get slaughtered like this. They are murderers aiding a ruthless dictator. 
t1_duprq6t	0	*	Nothing pays off here. We are working down the substance that has been built up by our fathers. Not a new bridge has been constructed in ages, not to talk about airports and stuff
t1_duoupjq	1	*	Wrong joke for cocaine.    Lieutenant, its 93% pure!  State Attorney, its 59% pure!  Judge, its 39% pure!  Guilty! Destroy the 400 kg of 13% pure cocaine.

t1_dunro2z	0	*	People keep buying them.   Every time you're buying tuna, beef, plastic packaging, [insert daily outrage here], you're telling the people making and selling it What you are doing is okay and I want you to do more of it.  If there's a product out there that's being made  unethically, you have the obligation to boycott it, tell others, and get legislation passed against it. And if your government is corrupt, the first two are ever more important.
t1_dud4yvi	1	*	Well know everything we need to know about Trumps involvement based on how he reacts to this news; penalize Russia, or Fake News!.
t1_dul8dud	1	*	Perfect!!

t1_duw7t8a	1	*	Seems like a trend.

t1_duc0o6p	0	*	Dont worry. I work for a consultancy dealing with mainly chinese automotive companies that cant even make a working engine.   They are still a long way behind even korea never mind the germans
t1_duqd7p3	1	*	It's actually my fantasy to have the FBI expose the Clinton campaign in all of this while the Trumpeter heads are rolling. I don't give a shit what color you wear if you are dirty and I suspect Clinton is, though likely much less than Trump, I want your head to roll.
t1_dukozdo	0	*	Either you don't understand how many trees 1 million are or you don't understand the relative size of a golf course.

t1_due45gz	1	*	Happy cake day 
t1_duuj1yo	1	*	Reddit user base leans left and is idealistic. They'll accept utopistic visions of all people just mysteriously getting along with everyone else as the inevitable end result, even though those same people are literally killing each other and are much more conservative on average than even some western hard line conservatives. How such people will trasform in large numbers from that to left wing progressives by just crossing a national border or two is never explained. DEMOCRACY!!!, I guess.
t1_duuj1yd	1	*	And he'd only be there 3 days a week, less gov interference
t1_duqvcyk	1	*	Because it is actually OK. Obama and Clinton's daughters were also too young to do the same. Do I think it is OK that a family member is doing this? No, not really but it is legal. She can be granted a temporary security clearance hence the title specifically saying permanent security clearance. 
t1_dupkmm8	1	*	>they raise taxes and cut spending.  I'm struggling to see how Merkel is similar to modern-day Republicans given that they've just cut taxes and increased spending.
t1_dugv2g9	1	*	Its a magnitude better than most countries media. 
t1_duxyms8	1	*	Or was their twitter account hacked?  Also, that 'new' video Newsweek posted is actually from about 6 years ago.
t1_dupt5iq	1	*	And the far-right is using the same tactics: denying people they disagree with their German citizenship if they do not fit into their racist definition of Germanness.
t1_duz52wx	0	*	Is her name seriously Nasty-a lol. 
t1_duyh1jf	0	*	well lorries often are diesel and bring goods, same with buses 
t1_duxfxz6	0	*	Not saying you're a liar, but could you provide a source? Unsure about the country, etc., doesn't inspire a ton of confidence.
t1_duizkvz	1	*	It's funny how much in common the U.S. and Russia have.  One could imagine conservatives of Russia and the U.S. getting along famously.
t1_dubt97z	1	*	Theoretically, they could tie is up for a while. Realistically, the Canadian Senate has zero effective power over legislation, and is effectively a rubber stamp.

t1_dug73ho	1	*	Oh yeah, he's going to jail. Well, isn't the head of the investigation his besty? So maybe not. Definitely a distraction tactic though.

t1_duwk2vq	0	*	Buying a diesel car post scandal, when everyone was talking about the real numbers for all diesel being terrible, was a big risk.  Curious why you didn't steer clear of what was clearly a long term issue in the making.

t1_dujojn3	1	*	List is outdated. Latvia and Lithuania is also spending 2% on defense.
t1_dua8019	1	*	Downvotes without responding, nice. Stop putting up strawman arguments about gun control, and engage in actual conversation. Here I have an idea that might work, but let's just downvote it because it doesn't match either side of the gun control narrative.
t1_dur469l	0	*	It's not real Socialism because it's failing. 
t1_duw8hvs	1	*	Not really clickbait, considering she is being deported because Interpol believes she was kidnapped and left the country against her will.  She's a 19 year old adult, she should have the right to say whether or not she was kidnapped. Sending her back into that forced marriage is disgusting.
t1_dutf7as	0	*	>Russia sounds pussy  This is not your middle school playground. Countries are not  going  to admit bad things to look badass. Usually when a leader takes that though guy stance he's ridiculed for being populist and not a good statesman. Reminds you of someone?

t1_duphgz3	1	*	> Fuck military  Sigh.  I wish, but that's not the reality of the world we live in.  I'd say fuck the defense contractor cartel that artificially inflates their R&D costs and goes overbudget all the time because they don't give a shit about the U.S. taxpayer's dime. 
t1_dunynur	1	*	> Google tracks in this same space, with similar motives to serve up hot, exciting stuff.  Google isn't anywhere near as complicit as the social media companies. Search results are intent-based, and Google doesn't make a cent on them unless we're talking about sponsored PPC results, which don't serve ads for fakenews sites, or news sites in general.  I guess you could make the case that some crazy ass video bloggers advertise their extremist videos on other youtube channels, though.

t1_dupj2fn	1	*	They have NOT cut, but increased spending.   The key point is higher tax income due to GDP growth. Germany at this point solely benefits from a strong industrial yet modern export focused economy and being part of the Eurozone, as otherwise interest rates would be much higher.

t1_dubk28r	0	*	THIS BAD THING THAT ONLY HAPPENS IN AMERICA'S LARGELY DEREGULATED AND PRIVATISED HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IS WHY REGULATION AND UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE TERRIFIES ME!
t1_dusinvt	1	*	We do.  Because they are a trading partner (over 500billion), and which benefits us, and why the everliving fuck would you want a hostile government on our southern border?
t1_dusinvl	1	*	No, but strictly speaking the US president giving an order to the leader of a foreign power ALSO isn't something that is done.  What IS done is called Diplomacy. We want something from them, so we give something back. If either side refuses to participate, then nothing happens.

t1_dukki3l	1	*	you can buy it for like 10$ and no prescription. 
t1_duv5h3y	1	*	Because if you remove term limits with the thinking that he's doing a positive job so who cares, what happens if he starts doing a bad job? Or if his eventual successor who is a negative force for the country uses the same extension powers? If a leader is being a cunt, at least you can say Ah well, at least they'll be gone in X years.
t1_duuridl	0	*	That's such a depressing thought.
t1_dup3hf1	1	*	There is a legitimate government in Ukraine and the U.S. is supporting it. This war was entirely started by Russia.
t1_duqkbvw	0	*	Not true.. A lot of people are upset by this. We didnt elect his children. Her and her hubby need to leave DC. This is unacceptable. 
t1_dud4bjh	1	*	Why would Putin (or Russia) need codes for that? The Alexander Litvinenko case more than proves how easy it would be for Russian agents to poison people and escape back to Russia. The person who was directly responsible for Litvinenko's death hasn't even been extradited back to the UK yet, for one thing. Yes, removing the head of a foreign government is a few steps beyond getting rid of a former KGB agent, but....

t1_dum6pfb	0	*	People who are so inculcated in a belief that they are wrong somehow and the only way to atone is by societal altruism.  There's a story of a Swedish woman who took in a migrant, said migrant proceeded to abuse her daughter.  Woman didn't report it because she didn't want the migrant deported.  That kind of person would protest this.
t1_duq9c21	1	*	The allegation is they used the NRA to funnel money into GOP campaigns.  And campaigns always need more money

t1_duuc2mi	1	*	This is exactly how the Russian's won. No one reads the fucking articles.
t1_dundkb4	1	*	You are being downvoted probably because you are confusing Hamas controlled Gaza with PA controlled West Bank, also you are making the oversimplification of all the martyr fund funding terrorism, it is more nuanced than that, whilst it is bad it isn't as bad as you make it out to be.
t1_duct4lk	1	*	US does something: this is bad, stop doing it.  US has the same thing done to them: they deserve it.  If you actually believed in the shit you're posting, you would oppose it no matter what.
t1_dum6tq9	1	*	Da. If this is how must be than so viet.
t1_dupihxj	1	*	Are kind of what Republicans could be if they changed completely? The points you laid out are beat for beat diametric from American conservatives, and further removed from other things Germany is currently doing well like renewable energy and having a functioning healthcare system.

t1_dun7yve	0	*	Idk man. I'm not saying troops are going home and bases disappearing but different strokes for different people   Japan is awesome, even their racism is friendly compared to what you UID find here  and the amount of bullshittery by our forces there is plain insulting. Every year there's rapes ,violence, curfew, negligence etc.
t1_durckac	1	*	I read a great article about this. That once the Socialists took over, they fired the knowledgeable engineers and replaced them with politically-connected party members.  Apparently, engineering/reality doesn't give a fuck about politics.

t1_duxlwfj	1	*	All religions are shit but Islam stinks the most
t1_duliq72	1	*	Yeah, weird that they don't want to have a nice meal with a genocidal regime and smile for their propaganda. I don't get it. Pence is such a dick.

t1_dunlzef	1	*	How about this. You tell us 3 things that Trump should be out of office for and 3 things Obama shouldve been out of office for and lets weigh them. 
t1_dur56i7	1	*	From what I was reading about a month ago (insert source) Venezuela's government has essentially banned foreign aid, or has made it very difficult for other countries to even attempt to intervene.
t1_dup8ytl	1	*	> Killing off NAFTA opened up free trade by removal of artificial controls on the price of corn (maize to UK friends).  We call it Corn here in the U.K. As well.

t1_dubnrup	1	*	What if?    Dude that's exactly what they want to do.   They don't care what party does it, they just care that it cripples us.   There's nothing to wonder here, this is exactly what they want...   This shouldn't be a question anymore at this point ha
t1_dulbm1g	1	*	Unlike in Poland. Religion is just about Catholicism.
t1_dujle09	0	*	Well, that statement is also false.
t1_duquur0	1	*	Not a fan personally, but this org has been around a long time and is very powerful. They don't need Russian money, and if they got some I really doubt it was on purpose. It isn't worth the risk for the NRA just the same if the AMA got Russian contributions.

t1_dutlf9z	1	*	Some, but not all. Measles, mumps and rubella are VERY contagious, you can catch them if you're vaccinated but have a weakened immune system for whatever reason. The more people are vaccinated the less chance there is of that happening since nobody gets the disease in the first place.

t1_dun8wlw	1	*	Local here dropping by. Majority of my countrymen support his governance, including me. :)
t1_dujhhpx	0	*	When was this supposedly occurring? Before the election or after?  If it was before, and they know we Russia was meddling, that's one thing.   If it's after the election and they then do it it's just a way to cast doubt on the election results after the fact.  Two very different situations such.

t1_duuxvun	0	*	This comment got me thinking.  If single party rule's inevitable result is dictatorship, and two-party rule's inevitable result is divisiveness and political gridlock... what's the minimum number of dominant parties required to ensure stable democracy for everyone indefinitely?
t1_duq8v7o	1	*	Hopefully this can be a stepping stone to making our democratic process me publicly transparent.
t1_dujb73y	1	*	So your place would get redecorated for free. I'm not seeing the problem here.
t1_duw6i95	0	*	Media says they don't know why rapes are going up just like they have no idea why the bees were dying for so long or why autism and autoimmune diseases are skyrocketing, or why 10,000 fish die in a stream... or any one of the other countless coverups that the cartel media engages in.  It's really simple - when you import people from a culture which blames women for getting raped, more rapes occur. If that doesn't make sense to you, please don't vote.
t1_duovshy	1	*	I know you were making a joke but seriously if I had the buying power Id be shorting the shit outta some stocks right now.

t1_dubn44n	1	*	they care about americans fighting amongst themselves  divide and conquer  but you already knew that
t1_duqa4tk	1	*	Ya because forensic accountants will totally help when it comes to mass shooters.   Maybe if the mass shooter lied on his tax returns the forensics accountants will flag it. 
t1_duhui6o	1	*	Welcome to Costco. I love you.
t1_duymllj	1	*	The podcast Embedded has a great 2 part episode systematically examining the Mueller probe. The first part is about the Trump-Russia ties and talks a lot about this meeting, well done and worth a listen
t1_dupfbbl	0	*	It's almost like Germany isn't allowed to have a large army anymore because well, you caused two world wars. 
t1_duxv3am	0	*	Breed more goats?
t1_duhnexs	1	*	The globe isn't warming naturally, it was actually in a gentle cooling cycle for the past 8000 years prior to our last century. See the Milankovitch Cycles, and also note that the ice extent trend was slowly increasing as well in the above study (until it drop suddenly).
t1_duhmzz0	0	*	Sgd 100 should last you for a week of food if you go ultra frugal mode, or 15 to 20 McDonald's meals.

t1_dufe4yo	0	*	> The Russians aren't the ones who nominated Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump  Well said but not perfectly true. The way mass media was left to degrade in the last ~35 years led to a daily popular rethoric that made those 2 candidates THE top choices. Those 2 are not an accident. They were the result of decades of decay and Russia is an important catalyst in this process.
t1_dundz9e	1	*	we do if they are in this exact scenario and do the same thing... are you serious?
t1_dubl3p6	1	*	Americans have been divided over guns a looooong time before Russia started doing stuff.
t1_duscjtc	1	*	This made me laugh out loud...
t1_duoy9p4	1	*	Aren't you people reading the article?  It isn't the Russian government who is smuggling the drugs. The Russian ambassador reported it, and Russia and Argentina mounted a joint operation to arrest people involved in both countries. The Russian government is also trying to arrest those responsible, they are the ones who found out and reported it after all!
t1_duiaqbk	1	*	Soros does it in the opposite direction, but he's evil apparently(?)
t1_duqaogi	0	*	It's because she's pretty and white.  I mean, if Obama said something along the lines of wanting to date Sasha or Malia, I think everyone would be outraged.  But somehow, it's ok if your daughter is a pretty white girl.
t1_duo4f3m	0	*	Trump has been in office for like only a year. And America has never been authoritarian. Can you imagine what year 8 would be like? It's a slow erosion
t1_dur8r7p	0	*	Simply because a simple one room apartment in a not so nice part of Zurich still can easily cost you more 2000SFR per month if you are unlucky - and you still have to get it.    For a single person it can be really tough to survive, especially around the bigger cities. 
t1_dul819o	0	*	Hes already released.   They say it right there in the article. 
t1_duvghea	1	*	What are you on about? The rape increase was reported far more than this and how the hell is four prevented terrorist plots and an increase of far-right threat level not important? Besides that who even said even said it was the countries top priority?    
t1_dupgb79	1	*	I love the people who think there is this global conspiracy with millions of people involved where somehow, not a single person has come forward with evidence of the conspiracy.

t1_dupea55	0	*	I'd give it a week before some teacher leaves their gun in the bathroom.
t1_duj77bm	1	*	I just don't get why everyone takes this video seriously. It's such an obvious joke, which makes little sense other than to get everyone's attention
t1_duslyrp	1	*	It's absurd that Trump expects Mexico to pay, yes. The rest of what you said is just racist shit.
t1_duzf9jp	1	*	Wow, please leave if you are not happy here.  
t1_duvqchr	1	*	They have a dictator problem

t1_dui46nh	1	*	Same could be said about Illinois. They've had a history of corruption, but they do have an impressive number of past politicians sitting in prison for long sentences. In a strange way I can respect that.
t1_dupomyk	0	*	Germany is not a socialist state. If you want to look at socialism, look at Venezuela.
t1_durb5ry	0	*	Part of the problem I believe has to do with science journalism itself.   The other thing I see is scientists offer all these doomsday warnings but never an idea to fix it or a solution that is actionable. So people become numb to these types of articles.

t1_dunqhqy	0	*	Loss to privacy: In the past year, its been enacted that ISPs can now sell your browsing history to the highest bidder, without your permission.  The loss of net neutrality, and the ability to freely access information equally, is hanging in the balance right now.

The vast majority of the people who starved were Ukrainian, and Stalin starved them intentionally. and if you ask the people of Ukraine, they'll tell you the same.

t1_duz90nd	1	*	We could also concentrate on infrastructure in the Eastern seaboard, the California corridor, the PacNW corridor, the SW corridors, etc.  The CA HSR is a decent start. Of course, we see the advantage of authoritarian gov'ts in that case as the CA project is getting delayed and costly due to cost of land acquisition and legal challenges.
t1_durbt2b	0	*	> A lack of diversification is what took them there, not socialism alone.   The lack of diversification is a direct consequence of the nationalization of industries and the restrictions placed on the private sector as part of the plan to turn the economy into a more socialist/state-directed/'fair' one.

t1_dulw3cf	1	*	You're not always in that situation when you have kids. A lot can change in ten years.   My mom had my sister, three years later my dad got hit with severe mental illness and left both the family and his job. They both had good jobs prior. Then outsourcing happened and my mom lost her good job and now works at Wal-Mart.   It took years for my dad to get on disability, until then there was no child support.

t1_duw263z	1	*	Seriously
t1_dujj3c8	1	*	Interesting. Critics of Singapore's compulsory savings plan (CPF) like to point to Australia's superannuation as something vastly superior.  CPF contributions are taxed advantaged; they are taxed neither on the way in, nor on the way out (through lump sum withdrawal or annuity payouts). Retirement age (drawdown age) has been raised in the past too.
t1_dugag4p	1	*	Cool, when did you choose to get it done?

t1_dubrsgo	1	*	Mass mobilization is a Maoist ideal that still has traction in the Chinese Communist Partespecially under the current leader.  He likes a well-times throwback.  Calling up 60,000 soldiers for a development task is about as perfect as mass mobilization opportunity as youll see these days.  For them, its got some pretty deep cultural and political significanceprobably more than the pragmatic effect.

t1_dupmmsg	1	*	try harder, troll. You are as obvious as fuck with the unoriginal username and low karma not to mention the account age.   May I give you a hint?

t1_dur3dtd	0	*	This seems the most probable of the theories being throw around.  Russian merc. command almost certainly knew US forces were in that location even if the grunts didn't. This allowed them to test both the US resolve/ROE and capability (type and speed of response) at a time when the SDF is stretched by the Turkish threat.  In fact I think the US knew this and that's why they hit them so hard, to send a clear message when they know the SDF is showing some vulnerabilities.

t1_duatxjj	1	*	I'd assume that the circle jerk in the West about Navalny incidentally has a similar effect as we'd see in the West if Russian social media was constantly talking about how great Trump is and how  they hope Americans vote against Clinton.    As in, making that person look like a stooge that a foreign nation wants to prop up.   As Russians seem to distrust anybody who the US may be backing after Yeltsin.

t1_dul5z5k	0	*	Spoiler alert: you're more than likely gonna have one
t1_dueswhw	0	*	Unlikely. $150k in election ads is nothing for a multi billion dollar company.  It's likely costing them tens millions of dollars in stock sales at the least. 
t1_duhnxhj	1	*	And clean coal. Its gonna be big, folks. Believe me.  Tremendous coal. Also, Rosie O'Donell is a gross cow and Kristin Stewart is a housebreaker whore. MAGA. There needs to be a wall... MAGA golf score.

t1_duz009l	1	*	don't forget that in some areas the FARC are still waging a guerilla war.  It's all economics. The most basic economics (which funnily everyone up in the CoC seems to ignore) that you can learn.$ x Coca plant > $ x anything else. And that's how the still exist to this day.

t1_duek4j9	1	*	Don't get your hopes up just yet. If you draw the parallel between the North-South Korean relations and East-West Germany relations in the Cold War, the GDR allowed some Western music to be played back in the 70s but only reunified in '89.  This is a step in the right direction, but this isn't going to lead to reunification on its own.

t1_duqe6nx	1	*	Yeah, they were founded by Union Army generals after the Civil War because people from the North were terrible shots.
t1_duwe3h4	0	*	You got it all wrong. The problem was not that Apple was taxed at a lower rate, problem was that no other company got the same deal. Because Irish know that tax system like this can't work in a long run. That could also imply that Apple gave some kind of bribes to Irish officials to give it a special treatment. Not to mention that it's a bad business practice because Apple started hiding money in Ireland. Including money from the USA so that they didn't have to pay USA taxes.

It did happen to buy votes to keep the party in power and overlook their stupid decisions though, so that's nice.

t1_dugpbo2	0	*	Here's the link to the [original press release](http://www.thoracic.org/about/newsroom/press-releases/resources/women-cleaners-lung-function.pdf). A cursory reading suggests that they simply did a survey and asked people do you clean using cleaning agents and then tested lung capacity and graphed it over time. They may not have asked the brand in the survey, so wouldn't be able to correlate the results with specific chemical compounds.
t1_dublxa2	1	*	Russia wants to weaken it's enemies (those that would stand in it's way of reclaiming it's rightful place at the world stage)  Trump was just a super efficient way to fuck us up for decades.  The politicians looking the other way because it benefits them in the short term need to be strung up as the traitors they are.

t1_duqhdil	0	*	Rest easy, Mueller is running a solid investigation.  But, its really odd that Trump has known Manafort for years, then all the facts start surfacing and we realize that Manafort is a criminal, and sells his soul for other countries... but why would Trump want him and Gates to run his campaign?  All these little oddities are piling up in the form of indictments.   I think youre onto something though... Trumps problems go back a long way.
t1_dupc0bj	1	*	It wasn't 80 according to Reuters, closer to 100:  > A Russian military doctor said around 100 had been killed, and a source who knows several of the fighters said the death toll was in excess of 80 men.  including wounded, they'd estimated 300 casualties.

It isn't just the same ol' immigrants are stealing our jobs bullshit. They are speaking of racial purity. Although she goes out of her way to say she's not a racist. Ugh.

We had this spot-on in the 70s and 80s; electric vehicles that delivered milk in a glass bottle that you washed and was collected the next morning by the milk man. Seems so odd that we got so lost over 3 decades and now it's some sort of near impossible goal to get back to those systems.
t1_duwqkhb	1	*	Fair point. But the video was there for everyone to see, with Deripaska and Prikhodko strolling around on the yacht.

t1_ducwq16	1	*	The main part of the pact is merely increased cooperation and to reduce redundancy.   Imagine if the USA had half a dozen types of main battle tank that did the same job instead of just the Abrams because different states went and designed their own instead.  It cuts down massively on wasted defence spending and allows a more streamlined approach.

t1_dugbsup	1	*	Yeah but this ban was purely political 
t1_dujjgxj	0	*	Trump hate? Thea heading of the article is a simple fact
t1_duavyq3	1	*	And they'd be right. This is state sponsored propaganda.
t1_duwciwu	1	*	13 million is not that impressive. Upgrading an decent size office building would probabaly cost more.
t1_duhh7zc	1	*	I believe pollen samples are one way to gauge global environment, as are ice cores. 
t1_duedp4y	1	*	Not really. Extradition treaties usually apply only to crimes that are considered crimes in both countries. Interfering with a US election doesn't fall under that. That said, many countries will do stuff they shouldn't just to please the US, of course.
t1_dubsj25	0	*	It's good if you use it for comedy and stuff.  There are some very funny content creators on there
t1_duub76m	0	*	I've often thought we should do the same to Japanese whaling vessels

t1_duaj3so	1	*	What good would it do? Sure the Kremlin could remove the videos and photos from the one site but by now millions of copies have been made in private computers and the information will keep turning up like a bad penny..
t1_dukb8lb	0	*	Humor is actually how a lot of normal, healthy humans deal with horrible things.
t1_duulae7	1	*	Careful with that information, it'll disturb the racist narrative that china is the only country that do this and is responsible for the problems of the world

t1_dupiol6	0	*	Of course. It has made everyone there into a billionaire!
t1_duvlw56	0	*	If you knew more about crypto currency you would realize that the technology behind many of the coins has value. Everyone in the space will admit shitcoins exist, but take a look at Ethereum. It has fantastic uses that validate the cost of the coins. 
t1_dupaifh	1	*	A friend of mine from Russia once said that their family was mindblown when they showed a video of an Aussie worker calling former Australian prime minister Tony Abbot a Dickhead to his face on TV when he was approached for conversation, they said that 'if someone did that in Russia to a politician, letalone the leader of the country, they'd go missing'. It really seems that this kind of glum complacency has bled into the culture of Russia at this point.

t1_duxmtha	1	*	Did you find too much public heir?
t1_duqkw6m	1	*	I thought it was interesting that the statement said that he was lobbying to promote Ukraine's interests, including entry to the European Union. Isn't Putin strongly against Ukraine becoming part of the EU? Or were Gates and Manafort working for Russia against Ukraine? I'm confused.
t1_duustoq	0	*	It is 4C in Montreal today. In February. Usually it's about 20-30 degrees lower and we don't get days like this until at least mid march. I'm very concerned.  It's like we have a reverse gulf stream now.
t1_duh8vgd	1	*	This specific thing?  No.  But it's yet another piece in a jigsaw puzzle that's coming together so completely we can already see the picture.  We just can't quite read the signs in it yet.  But we will.
t1_duy8c07	1	*	What you really have to ask yourself is why the fuck is Malema still allowed in parliament? If a white dude said things like this he would be in jail right now, not on the top political stage FFS

t1_duot62a	1	*	Like the linked article?  That says: She told reporters that Russian and Argentine police had decided to mount a sting operation after the Russian ambassador informed them of the drugs find in December 2016.
t1_duj4027	1	*	As far as the video goes, they are meant to take a gay man who broke up with his partner as a tenant for a month, and if he doesn't find a boyfriend in this time, the husband of the foster family has to cohabit with him as a gay couple. 
t1_dua4tg2	0	*	We europeans have a sentence to describe americans :   They are at the same time the worst and the best of humanity.  US is the freedom country, his soft power has conquered the world, and it's the land of dreams for people everywhere in the world. On the other hand their thirst of liberty has made them do some strange things.
t1_dumak4c	1	*	Feiglin all the way.
t1_dunj4mp	1	*	Because I know you will be downvoted to hell for this because I do every time I make a similar post... Yes. Absolutely. Obama did virtually nothing for the underprivileged beyond what Bush did or Trump has done. He was a neoliberal puppet who ravaged developing nations just like your typical Western neoliberal.
t1_dusxiri	1	*	I'm curious when you say Chinese here, does that mean from China? Or is it like ABC/CBC?

t1_duic2ew	1	*	> Plus, it's common for young boys who aren't circumcised to get infections.  It's common to get anal infections if you don't wipe your ass too. If you don't clean your body, don't be surprised their are repercussions. 
t1_duynu36	1	*	Convenient how all these authoritarians are eliminating political opponents while grabbing power under the guise of being anti-corruption/drug/whatever. 
t1_dutp66v	1	*	I wish they had gone out and captured the rest. It would be funny watching russia trying to say they are mercenaries when we ID them as active soldiers.       Also it would give the US a lot of leverage and also be interesting to see how it goes down. 
t1_duwwehl	1	*	Because the alternative is Theresa May and the conservatives lol
t1_dutrpav	1	*	Dan Carlin did a fantastic 5 part podcast on the Mongolian empire.  Just wanna throw that out there it's really the only thing I know about Mongolia.
t1_dudsh2l	1	*	Is that what the indictment claimed they were being indicted for? Is this just another attempt by lowly people on the right attempting to push a narrative, ie, damage control.  Grow up, the only people buying your shit are people like yourself who want to defend trump (your god) any way they possibly can.
t1_duspf6u	1	*	It's awful - better he didn't say anything:  >Its a completely different context historically, legally and so forth,  That's probably a gift to NRA cheerleaders.

t1_dudzhrv	1	*	> They just went there in masses, to fight. Alone..... No help. Hundreds....  Actually they did - to fight for IS. There were several thousands. That was one of the goals declared by Russia - to prevent them from coming back.  There were groups from half of the EU as well. Not so numerous though.
t1_dun0ylz	1	*	They had an easy target.  Our own media has been sowing discord in our own country long before the Russians got involved.

t1_dud7p8t	1	*	Good point, unless this was just one of many (or at least 2) investigated instances of interference.  But maybe Americans unknowingly helped them and are just idiots.  Not collusion, but incompetence perhaps.

t1_dup0csv	1	*	I think it's a Jonathan Pie line You know it's time to check the batteries in your smoke detector when Australia gets a new Prime Minister  It's a joke on an international level and you can see what that instability has done to our relationships with our neighbouring countries. 
t1_dujd5xk	1	*	This is a country where they were talking about replicating Zimbabwe's mistake of confiscating land from white farmers so sober problem solving may not the where the country's culture is at.
t1_dun5cxz	1	*	I think there's a meme for that
t1_duwq7f7	0	*	> Don't let your cities turn into Beijing, Europe.  You do realize that they already were far worse than Beijing?  Beijing is simply doing now what the West has done a few decades ago.  You mean don't revert to a stage of industrialization.
t1_duppxmk	0	*	Germany has a utilitarian justice system  If the criminal is deemed a grave danger to society he can be detained for longer than his prison sentence.   I suspect this will happen in this case.

t1_duhwyso	1	*	> The IOC not allowing athletes to take care of their health is a violation of their human rights.  Well I guess it's a good thing they actually do allow them to take care of their health! If he had a legitimate medical condition he should have applied for a TUE. You know, like literally every other athlete who has to take medications that are on the list?
t1_duwu7az	1	*	Meanwhile in Alberta and BC we've got the perfect amount of doctors because Western lumber+oil economy = many moneys. When we run out of that, we're fucked (except for the coast)
t1_ducs7vv	1	*	Nah, the blame is that Hillary didn't think of it first, trump just played the internet game well
t1_duds7si	1	*	Actually, it costs much less than $1-2 per pill.

t1_dusqtcv	0	*	to swimming underwater , agreed.
t1_duguni8	1	*	I'm not really sure how this happened. What I do know is that a lot of Americans are mad. I also know that many of those angry people don't know *why* they're mad. I also know that many of those people who don't know why they're mad don't even *care* why they're mad. They're just pissed! And they're allowed to vote, as they should be of course, but the fact that remains that when ignorant people vote they make ignorant choices.

t1_dumcu8c	1	*	Thats crazy talk, these kids are at school, they aren't allowed to just leave school whenever they want. Its not kidnapping to keep kids in school until school ends. If they want to leave they need permission from their parents. You can't just have kids be able to walk out of school  whenever they feel like it, when has that EVER been a thing? All the 12 year olds can just walk out the door at 11am because they feel like it?? No one would ever be at class.

Justice for the people is more important than vengeance against their oppressors.

t1_dudnd0x	0	*	> its like that price was created to never be paid I dont get it..  If guess with your coupon the insurance covers the rest. All this price gouging works (for now) because some people have insurance and the price is paid. Those who do not are fucked anyway.

But it could indeed be because there are in fact more rapes happening.  Without some study digging into this we simply don't know. Statistics can be highly misleading.

t1_duo0foa	1	*	Few Americans love Trump. Its all relative. When compared to some other country leaders he looks like a nincompoop.  When compared to Putin, Xi, etc. tho? He looks like a damn saint.  I love my Canadian brothers and sisters, but sometimes your guys underlying smugness when you compare yourselves to America can lead to a lack of objectivity.  ^^^ see this btw? This is a generalization. Much like calling Americans impressionable, and it doesnt actually apply to everyone in a group.
t1_dufy6x3	1	*	Just like with computer manufacturers, many airplane components have backdoors intentionally engineered for various reasons. People with control over these components can manipulate sensor readouts like GPS or airspeed, which in theory could be used to take out a plane by a bad actor. The convoluted patent system makes these vulnerabilities hard to avoid. As long as people in power can benefit from abusing these flaws I don't see airplanes being 100% safe any time soon. 
t1_dubqntq	1	*	Uh, nobody called you a bot. The article is pointing out that there are bots mixed in with genuine commenters, causing real people to get sucked in by fake pro-gun content that's intended to cause strife in your country. Don't pretend as if all conservatives are being called bots, whah! when that's not happening at all. 
t1_dubo5g2	1	*	You have any extra hats to lend to those people? 
t1_dubo5g8	1	*	The bots on twitter are a lot more obvious.
t1_duacn1z	1	*	The article is likely to appeal to people who already liked being in the EU, because you should totally form your opinions on what other countries, or 'Japan' (translation: People who liked the EU) think.
t1_duk4jf7	1	*	Arrest first, research later. He should be grateful they didn't throw him in prison yet. At least they try to make it look like there's presumption of innocence

t1_duue5ej	1	*	It feels that way. I feel really sick, Hong Kong was bad enough but watching China devour a free and independent democracy like Taiwan would be an unmitigated tragedy. Especially knowing that the world sold them out for cheap consumer goods. 
t1_due5w4t	1	*	Equally amazing is the number of idiots calling out others for being wrong while providing no useful insight of their own. Such as you. And me. 
t1_duuszff	0	*	Saying it's a farce means he's doing it as a joke, but he actually is running.  Kinda like a trump campaign. 
t1_dudb8rk	0	*	nobody is shitting on republicans, it's trump supporters specifically they are shitting on, and more specifically the trump supporters that think that these indictments means that trump is vindicated. I mean, complete fucking morons might be a better way of describing someone like that, but it's not far off 
t1_dumooa9	1	*	It wouldn't even take that.  A student will assault a teacher (non lethally) and the teacher will kill the student with their weapon out of instinct or fear.  
t1_dujijci	0	*	We officially have moved on from truth as a metric for trustworthiness.  It doesn't matter.  I'm not sure how much it ever did, but the envelope has been pushed to far and with so much success that all doubt has been removed: America has no interest in facts.  Just feelings.

So, the probability is very high. :)
t1_duuofsp	1	*	Yeah, but its been called that awhile because educated science-based people who know History know people fuck up regularly.

t1_duj84nf	1	*	The fear is about a receiving role in a homosexual relationship specifically. As modern Russian culture is largely based on prison culture, this is the greatest humiliation possible that a person can endure.  The dominating side of homosexual intercourse is normalized an is a common curse/threat/joke material.
t1_ducu5r2	1	*	No matter what they did the DNC can put whoever it wants for election. It isn't even illegal for them not to have a primary. Shady? Sure but not illegal.

t1_dux7alf	1	*	It was known about and talked about among the extreme hippy/weird folks.   But most people prefer to buy stuff.     You don't hear much from the non-consumerist types. It can be a fun way to live but it isn't glamorous and is an intentional rejection of status, which even staunch liberals avoid.

t1_dut21f2	1	*	If you are talking about Head of States, this isn't true. Here is a [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_political_term_limits#Europe), most countries have something in the range of two 5-year terms as a limit.
t1_duij8ss	1	*	?? alcohol isnt illegal. also, to avoid people being irresponsible with gum its banned for sale, but you can bring it in and chew gum (locals often buy n bring them in from malaysia, neighbouring country less than an hour drive away) its not enforced. and lets face it, freedom has a price anywhere in the world. just like how being able to walk safely in streets at night means having a reliable and strict police force and legal system.

t1_dubgpf8	0	*	This is what I argue we do with our (US) soldiers as well, except with our infrastructure. It's a bloated and unnecessary, already tax payer based, labor force waiting to be utilized in a moral way.  We need less military action and a lot of infrastructure repair, improvement, and addition. Seems like common sense to everyone other than the supremacist war mongerers and arms manufacturers.

If you're complaining about the dramatic headline, sure, but as long as they get it factually right (or admit it when they don't) most people do trust the media, as they should.  Journalism matters.

t1_duqm2nr	1	*	The Clintons, living in your head rent free.  
t1_dud3b3w	1	*	Yuri Milner is the tie.  Paradise papers proved his money is actually the Kremlin's.  He also somehow did series funding with twitter too 
t1_duf42x0	1	*	Yeah, I was thinking they would have been safe in the air...
t1_dujvrr8	1	*	I genuinely feel like we could read a headline that says, Donald murders baby and is openly gay with Putin and nothing would happen.

t1_duc1g57	0	*	Renting in the UK really needs some sort of security of tenure though - it would be much less of a problem if you couldn't be given the heave-ho at 2 months notice with no reason.   2 month isn't too bad if you're single and renting a room, but it's considerably more of a problem when you're renting unfurnished and have a family. 
t1_dun0col	1	*	You gotta pay the toll troll...
t1_durodd5	0	*	I posted this below:  >One seems much worse for some reason. I wonder what that could be? > >https://m.imgur.com/a/7KS8s > >No. 1 and no. 8 are from a film, but you can understand the point. 2 bombs dropped to end a war and mitigate American casualties vs. hundreds of thousands of individual acts of barbarism. 
t1_dubyx2a	0	*	I read that there has been the equivalent of 21T USD in new money created within Western economies in the last 10 years as part of the Quantitative Easing policy that happened since the recession. That money goes into the economy through bank loans. Guess where banks love to loan? Real estate. See the problem yet?  In Vancouver we have a ton of resentment towards foreign buyers but I think it's just much easier to blame foreigners than to understand the nuances of central bank policies.
t1_duhnmap	1	*	Nice, cherry picking the one dictator we overthrew in the name of good and brushing under the rug the dozens that we supported who were pure evil.

t1_duyxnqz	1	*	>  Well, he would keep walking in while we were getting changed, not to mention he would grab our genitals uninvited  We should probably make it clear that contestants from **Miss Teen** USA - yes 15 and 16 year old girls have accused him of [the same behavior](http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/article/2016/oct/18/allegations-about-donald-trump-and-miss-teen-usa-c/)  Gobs Of Projection...anyone wonder if Trump owns a pizza parlor? 
t1_dukvzkt	1	*	Yes
t1_duieq7u	1	*	yup. same rhetoric is used all around the world to justify tax cuts for the rich.
t1_duhzz0a	1	*	Yep. I fully admit mistake were made. We need to do better than this shitshow. President Trump is such a gubber. 
t1_dueuw4m	1	*	The epicentre was closer to Swansea in South Wales. The South of England is anything under Birmingham. The South of the United Kingdom, what with it being more than one country, is anything South of Scotland.

t1_duc2pxq	0	*	You wonder if they got the pregnancy start date wrong. Thats quite a long time to be overdue.
t1_dujo2m5	1	*	Utter malarkey tbh. What a ridiculous, cowardly cop out. We had 17 US intel agencies and dozens of allies all confirming Russian interference for over a year now but its okay that TRump never said anything because he didnt believe it. Even now with Muellers 13 indictments, we still havent seen Trump condemn the Russian actions.    
t1_ducskq7	1	*	Congrats! I'd love to be on that list but I've never had a twitter account lol. Keep up the good fight! 
t1_duaai7f	0	*	I dont know about all that; just seems like ditching the Common Market probably isnt gonna go so well for Britain. EU by far has the upper hand in negotiating there. 
t1_duq7gil	1	*	They certainly did do that at one time in their lives, then [things changed](http://www.cracked.com/article_25195_how-nra-lost-its-mind.html) some time during the 20th century
t1_duhsuiq	0	*	The twist is the drug was pot. They found out because he scarfed down 12 Ho-Hos and a 2 liter of Mt.Dew after the match.  
t1_dur1ofu	1	*	> And, more to point for the government, too weak to revolt.  Which government? US has been targeting Venezuela since they threatened to provide free heating oil to America's poor.
t1_dud6ecz	1	*	Seriously most money is sucked up by landlords in most places around the world. So all that money provides little benefit. Usually first its your taxes (but at least this Money is handled transparently) and then your rent. Then what little you have left is what you get to live with and invest in the rest of society. At least I hope the landlords are doing something useful with that money, and I dont just mean for themselves or to a select few large companies. More toward wider society.

t1_dujjb8w	0	*	Hey look, it's a T_D poster who didn't read the article (or chose to ignore it). What a surprise!
t1_dulo8rv	0	*	Yeah, true. But you also don't have a lot of uncontrolled migration from countries with very poor healthcare and precarious sanitary conditions. 
t1_dup8pks	1	*	Possibly Luxottica. They're pretty much *the* glasses megacorp and since their semi-recent fusion with Essilor they own not only most high-profile eyewear brands but also a sizable chunk of the high-refractive materials market.  Then again, since this stuff needs to be reapplied every once in a while they'd probably just sell it at a price where it's a good deal for some but not all people.
t1_duuug8i	1	*	They throw away the key and then randomly execute you without prior notice at some arbitrary date they decide. They will then inform your family *after* you are dead.  Not making this up, this is how executions actually work in Japan (highly simplified).
t1_duqwozt	0	*	You think so, but who sold him the property in the first place? The government. Imagine you bought land from the government, and then they arbitrarily rescinded the rights they granted you. This should be a problem blamed on the government. If they didn't want someone being protective over their property, then they shouldn't have sold it in the first place. 
t1_duvw4mb	1	*	The media is only helping them by calling them trolls instead of what they really are.  I'm not claiming any grand media conspiracy, I just think they're lazy morons.
t1_duqpbfi	0	*	In estonia if youre conscripted but a pacifist, they just give you a gun made of wood. Or you go to an old peoples home and wipe peoples asses for a year.
t1_duka1jx	1	*	I agree with you, but Ive actually heard that he was quite kind to anybody under him. Theres a thread somewhere around here about how he treated people at a country club he owned. Fuckin idiot, buts hes more than that, hes a kind fuckin idiot who doesnt know right from wrong.
t1_duuprwd	1	*	I don't think I've ever seen altruism practiced in geopolitics, but I also wish a nation would intervene. I read a few articles about China working behind the scenes to end the cleansing, but I haven't heard about much else since that.

t1_duhevtp	1	*	So original. Russia Lago is still the best. The Winter White House where you can make money and make your friends richer? Lovely. 
t1_duzdan7	1	*	The Taliban has proposed talks with the US before but never mentions the Afghan government. US said that they have to recognize the central government as a precondition to talks. It's been 16 years of warfare. Everyone knows that the end of this war will come in the form of a political compromise. Including the US.
t1_dujw4kv	0	*	I don't know what you mean by our rebels, but it doesn't matter who they are as long as they are fighting Assad.  Edit: It is sad yet true that the West has been doing this shit for about seven years, now.

t1_duvc8vy	0	*	It works for me. What browser?
t1_dul218t	0	*	It's not entirely clear how much Twitch is influenced by Amazon in terms of management and decision-making. As for what Amazon gets out of it, I suppose that is something to be wary of.
t1_dudh58e	1	*	Yup.  Doesn't mean there's no evidence.  Just means that case ain't fully baked yet.  Meanwhile, Mueller's going to soon have 13 Russian nationals (Russians connected to the collusion living in the States) on-hand to squeeze for more leads.  Basically this just means, the case is proceeding, 13 more arrests, and no one's off the hook yet.
t1_dugzo4p	1	*	We already have this system in place in Australia. It works inverse to how you describe. If for example you do nursing, you are subsidized by the government more than someone doing photography because we need more nurses. I think this is reasonable.  It also acts as a disincentive to doing degrees which have no employability.

t1_dunk1et	0	*	The Democrats bailed out General Motors even though they failed because the free market was demanding more environmentally friendly cars.  They also didnt prosecute BP executives or male them pay for Deepwater Horizon, and they continued the cycle of perpetual war in the Middle East (the military industrial complex is a MAJOR contributor to global warming)  The Dems dont give the slightest fuck about global warming if it means lining the pockets of their special interests

t1_duwemyj	1	*	Whoops you dropped your /s  Cant be too careful nowadays 
t1_duwuao3	1	*	The reason you don't understand it is you think any of these groups actually want equality. Everyone is just lobbying for their groups self interests. Every political movement that talks about equality makes a lot more sense if you think of them that way. Equality is the motte, Power is the bailey   just so i don't get a bunch of upvotes from morons, This applies to MRAs and shit too. 
t1_dulb3pl	1	*	I quite liked the class, even though I was going through my edgy atheist phase at the time.

So, if he is not concerned with the future of humans and many other species on the planet, his nonchalance is spot on.

PEI and Yukon have better pays, but that's because nobody wants to work there :P.  There is even more to this.  The goal was to bring them somewhat to par with Ontario doctors, but, the cost of living is much greater in Ontario. so, same salary with a lower cost of living made the Quebec doctors somewhat richer.   
t1_dutladg	1	*	It's not really that expensive, and you don't have to get them all at once.  The main ones are whooping cough, measles, and polio.  They are like $35 a piece in the US without insurance.  If you're in Europe you can probably get them cheaper.
t1_duq6jzu	1	*	These investigations are occurring because we need to find out how we are being divided by a foreign power.

t1_duwmhdg	0	*	I think legalization is a good thing. In fact, I go one step further: drugs should be regulated in terms of purity and content, sold at pharmacies, taxed, and proceeds put towards addictions services.

t1_dubplao	1	*	To be honest, I'm questioning whether this is Russian shillery or just a rented botnet 
t1_duamnyf	0	*	Yes, you'll be known as Cancer Boy. Your super power will be dying slowly. j/k
t1_duhujkz	0	*	Maybe all those mexican drug cartels should just get into smuggling cancer drugs in...
t1_dun6zr5	0	*	The step after that is converting children into cyborgs as well.
t1_dunw9r3	1	*	How do you think theyre able to be motivated to work 80 hour weeks?
t1_duwxbe5	1	*	This comment can be applied to a lot of shit recently.
t1_durc0vq	1	*	Let's talk comfort women if we're going to talk about the ultimate conclusion that were the nuclear strikes. 
t1_dutqami	1	*	I'm dutch,  I know a few people who didn't vaccinated their kids. None did it for religious reasons, none did it because of the autism bullshit, they aren't into some conspiracy theory. They all did it because they're basically hippies, they don't want their kids vaccinated because vacines are unnatural.   What's worse, some of them put their kids together frequently, since dutch daycares don't accept non-vaccinated kids they take turn watching eachother's kids.
t1_duhq09h	0	*	This is the website my dearly departed friend used for years to get his COPD medicine from India that would have otherwise left him a poor destitute ... A years worth of medicine for less than what a 1 month supply would cost in the States. https://www.alldaychemist.com/  They are very much legit and charge the same for shipping be it 1 pill or 1000 pills
t1_dudkzfb	0	*	That story is confusing
t1_dupfpic	1	*	with flip flops
t1_duu7e9w	1	*	I've always felt sorry for the Russian people to be saddled with such leaders.  But it's also true they've known nothing else - at least when you leave the cities.  Villages with no roads to them.  Horses still being used for labor & transportation.  The last time they rose up in revolt, all they ended up doing was changing masters. The USSR folded & the strong men moved right back in.
t1_durl4qw	1	*	What about the rape of nanking comments add nothing fruitful to this discussion.   Im concerned if these people simply do not know that the same logic applies to almost any other country or theyre just bigots.   War is war and there are some degrees on the atrocities of them, but we shouldn't discredit the nuke survivors 
t1_duvp9yi	1	*	Its pretty much the whole of South East Asia, and I have no doubt in my mind the issue occurs outside of Asia also.
t1_dueznly	1	*	I thought it was the onion
t1_duwepta	0	*	Well, there's still their spouse, who likely shared the ideology, but won't necessary go to prison as well. They'd retain custody. 
t1_duhlcjq	1	*	Drive a traditionally powered car, fuck bitches and get money 
t1_dua74jg	1	*	Because that area of the world.. everyone holds hands and sings cumbaya
t1_duyp5oq	0	*	Worst spy ever
t1_dunimqu	1	*	Because this only has to do with America, right?
t1_duru5iu	1	*	The crazy thing is that *it doesn't matter if humans cause this change or not*.  Of course we did, but even if you refused to admit we have anything to do with the climate changing, that won't stop it from killing you.
t1_duehelk	0	*	Hypocrisy at its finest.
t1_dug225c	0	*	Doesnt mean others cant comment on it.
t1_duc0wls	1	*	What sort of wimp downvotes this obvious joke
t1_duazzzk	1	*	Don't be intellectually dishonest. It has nothing to do with hate speech. If you look at the videos, Instagram posts, etc. that Russia is trying to get social media to take down, it all has to do with exposing government corruption, not hate speech.
t1_dul5rsd	1	*	I am not backing any of his decisions nor am I backing any of trumps decisions but your statement is ludicrous. If Trump/Duterte are so dumb how did they rise to the ultimate power of their respective countries?? They arent dumb nor is that the problem. Its the complete opposite. The citizens of both countries are the ones to blame. 
t1_duq9h7y	0	*	*Puts on tin foil hat*  What if they're also behind mass shootings, and the goal is ultimately to get all our guns banned, but they want to divide us as much as possible while doing it?  Inb4 my comment ends up on /r/conspiracy in a non-joking way.
t1_duifx7h	1	*	We're the once ones who can make and distribute this. If you want to live, you pay what we say you pay.  Sincerely, U.S. Patent Office
t1_duj7x23	1	*	Indeed. Although, I would argue war is inevitable in Korea. 
t1_ducybg9	1	*	I think it's depend on where are the servers. Most of web company that give international content have servers across the globe. For better response time I think.
t1_duxk24w	1	*	Just the thought of that thing creeping up on you and you turn around to come face to face with this smiley face...

t1_dusy87b	1	*	At least your beef remains delicious. 
t1_dupjior	1	*	Nah America has a huge surplus of thoughts and prayers. So much that they have plans it to give everyone for free.
t1_dut2krc	0	*	You know if Kim didn't throw out BS threats I wouldn't even mind. From a certain perspective you can argue that powers like the US, UK and Russia have made puppets of other parts of the world and NK would understandably want to be able to defend themselves.  But Kim is silly and nukes are terrifying so I hope eventually we so see a nuclear free NK - ideally a nuclear (bomb) free world. 
t1_duy64o0	0	*	> My heart goes out to the Persians living there.  What about the non-Persian Iranians? You know, 40% of the damn country?
t1_duy7ht9	1	*	Probably the most original comment i've ever seen in a thread about Russia U0001f604U0001f601U0001f4a6
t1_duj9dua	0	*	I have a hard time believing that wasn't posed.  Freezing to death isn't so instantaneous.
t1_due7sb2	1	*	Look at it this way: a charity worker would be unlikely to just become a rapist, but a rapist would see a lot of opportunity in becoming a charity worker. 
t1_durqoij	0	*	Teenagers dont use drugs because drugs are illegal. Thats what you just said. 
t1_duh8gzd	0	*	Do you even know what he was charged with? Hint: not treason.
t1_duput6p	0	*	I wonder how many CIA is corrupt myths are from the actions of foreign governments?
t1_duuw41d	1	*	I rule the slaughter.
t1_duvcrzi	1	*	What a bizarre second statement, especially in response to an article about the US beating Russia in a battle...
t1_duxxctj	1	*	You can see the above picture right? There are men in the group 
t1_dutpf0e	1	*	Did you read the article? They are citing groups who historically don't vaccinate or take their ill to the doctor. These are people in rural Romania.  Not just stupid people 
t1_dufot23	1	*	Its worth noting that one of them is just a general political sub and the other is radicalized kids and already resulted in several deaths with more sure to come. 
t1_duyly88	1	*	Genital invitations are like a buck at Hallmark
t1_dusic6p	1	*	Right?  There's already a wall, built and enhanced under Obama, and no democrats seem to realize that. 
t1_dulkmh5	0	*	>  It makes the words of the religious leader sound like it is the norm for all in the group.  Billy Graham's views are pretty mainstream in the United States. Billy Graham was a major thought leader who advised Presidents in his day. Billy Graham Jr. is a major thought leader today and spoke at Trump's inauguration.  This is the United States of America in all its fanatical fucking glory. 
t1_duogas1	1	*	Make a law or regulation and garunteed a off the rocker individual hell bent on murder will break that law.   Only decent people obay laws.
t1_duszsbr	0	*	So Xi is Yuan Shikai?
t1_duwel70	0	*	Yeah, this article is really grasping at straws with its suggestions of foul play.  Li's liver cancer was advanced enough to hospitalize him. Combined with his young age, this suggests his cancer was particularly aggressive and a very poor prognosis.
t1_duq8jsd	0	*	The Marshall Plan?
t1_duz7dvo	1	*	Did anyone ever really doubt it?
t1_duaohxn	1	*	I can't imagine they do
t1_duj2o8s	1	*	But they are apparently more resistant to propoganda than Americans.
t1_duoc0vr	0	*	Karma grinder
t1_duehlup	1	*	One Korea is a thing i want to see too. All these people talking about its just a PR move or something. Maybe Kim Jong Un has changed heart. Unlikely, but its something i would like to see rather than be pessimistic about the situation. Its one cool thing going on right now amongst all this madness in our world. 
t1_dudugja	1	*	and listen to the gripes and groans and Daily Mail comments when it goes up to xa310
t1_duoq4ka	1	*	Oh, the 200kg is there in the corner...
t1_dus96t5	1	*	Im sure there are volunteering opportunities at certain museums. A lot of works sit undocumented in the basement. Its like a discovery within itself ;3
t1_dur4xs2	0	*	Asthma medication helps you to breathe like a normal person. What the hell do you think that medicine is used for?
t1_dua71m9	1	*	I dont think any of these politicians pray for anything unless it can be used as a photo op. 
t1_dua5mlv	0	*	Ninjas pls explain
t1_dugxoqy	0	*	> overwhelming minority  I assume you mean either an overwhelming majority or a small minority.
t1_dupf5ub	1	*	As a matter of fact that's exactly how it works.   When bad people have guns and good people don't, bad things happen.   Politicians, athletes, actors all have armed bodyguards protecting them. No one bats an eye at that meanwhile our children don't deserve that same protection? 
t1_ducji13	1	*	I think more of the issue is parents try to take care of the issue for a day or two at home then take them to hospital.  If you get the flu and start getting iv fluids and drugs to knock fever down most likely be fine if you start at day one. My parents would have sent me to school.
t1_dupdcol	0	*	Are you telling me Argentina didn't invade a sovereign nation without authorisation ?! No way
t1_duaw94p	0	*	I dont see how low power non ionising radiation could possibly harm anyone.  The mechnics behind radio/sound emissions are very well understood. You cant accidentally make someone sick with a tiny antenna.

t1_durfm8x	1	*	Do victims of Japan' war crimes welcomed to tell their story in Japan? Judging from this: (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-usa-comfortwomen/japans-osaka-to-snap-sister-city-link-with-san-francisco-over-comfort-women-statue-idUSKBN1DO0KA) I guess not.
t1_dune88d	1	*	Because it has the words Trump and Russia in the title.
t1_duj85b3	1	*	Best horror film of 2018. Cannot wait for the sequel.. Or for YouTube to start recommending homophobic Russian videos for me to watch. 
t1_dutg9ed	0	*	You know, when you put it like that, I kind of want to burn more hydrocarbons and throw more plastics in rivers. No point trying, am I right? Might as well just make it all die faster. /s  Seriously, if you tell people we're doomed and there's no stopping it, some of those people will say Fuck it and strive to make the problem worse instead of helping.
t1_duio3aw	1	*	Has happened a few times in the last 10 years in HK, too.
t1_duketbw	1	*	> That being said it's definitely a step in the right direction.   I have my doubts. Correct me if I'm wrong, but the goal is sequestration of the fugitive gas co2. The tree inhales it, performs some magic with sunlight and adds the carbon to its body as it grows. But when its fully mature, then what?  And as its getting eaten by termites and other bacteria, they are exhaling that fugitive co2 back out again. Trees seem like a pause button, not a long term solution. Why not phytoplankton?
t1_dush7ct	0	*	I looked at your post history. You're clearly a Russian Bot trying to divide America.
t1_dugfeji	1	*	There was a big to do when my aunt had it done in the hospital (American, it's basically standard practice here) vs. At a home religious ceremony.  Get with the times fam.  It's weird as fuck and unsanitary.  I'm against having my child circumcised, and we are planning to start trying in 6 months.  I'm sure it will be a huge issue for both our families (his is devote Catholic).  They'll get over it. Or not, I don't really care. 
t1_duf7p3v	0	*	Thats not what the FBI said. You should be more informed before you spew bullshit. The same 13 Russians bought Bernie ads and organized anti-Trump rallies. 
t1_duw36wc	1	*	You just don't understand the difference between climate change and weather patterns. This is just a weather pattern stop believing everything the left wants you to believe. -coworker    Some people just refuse to look at evidence and choose to trust politicians with oil and coal investments instead of scientist who've dedicated their lives to studying humans effects on climate change. 
t1_dubikbb	1	*	I'm critical of US foreign policy, too. But that doesn't mean Moscow is good.

t1_duutt1a	1	*	I found it funny when a reality TV star ran for US president in 2016. 
t1_dupkas3	1	*	You dont need a military until you need a military. This is just like playing a game of Civ and using all your resources to build and some assholes decide to start a war and take over your entire country.  What you suggest is how I wish the world was. Unfortunately it isnt and cant be, at least not yet.   Their gain is our loss unfortunately.
t1_dui7tf4	1	*	I like how Gates grew up as a buissnessman. I can see why he has this passive aggresion towards other rich people, back in the early days of computers when microsoft held like 99% of the market they activel tried to fuck him over because he had sort of monopoly over the market. 
t1_duymeyg	1	*	Well since the election cycle is at least that long (remember Trump filed with the FEC on his inauguration day) then I'd think it's quite plausible that a conspiracy would begin early. The biggest question for me is what does Russia have on Trump and how are they using. It could be something even older for all we know. It doesn't matter if they got it to influence the future president or a high profile business man with connections, either way he became president and now he is beholden to them.
t1_duj4yjp	1	*	Jokes on you, the extra weight on the water will simply push the bottom of the ocean floor down and Floridia up.  TL;DR - you are stuck with Flordia :P

t1_dulrb3x	0	*	Even then, I doubt Trudeau will take the side of the CIS
t1_due9imf	1	*	Convicting someone in a court of law is different from firing them. Suspicion is enough justification to remove someone and provide whatever information you have to the authorities 
t1_duk6xh7	1	*	yeah bro, that'll show him!   also, that's an interesting profile you got there
t1_duw7y3q	1	*	Isn't that what China did and people were wondering why?  This is why.
t1_duluz80	0	*	Living in Israel I meet tons of Filipinos who come for work.  I always ask, and they always say how much they adore the guy. 
t1_duea33o	1	*	But that's what the people wanted. And no vaseline please, we are British after all.
t1_duhteva	1	*	Nope. The last ice age ended almost 12000 years ago, and global temperatures had been in slow decline as we headed towards the next ice age.
t1_duvfhxw	1	*	18 year olds. Social pressure is a strong incentive. 
t1_duc1877	1	*	If a democrat suggested this, a bunch of fascists would claim that they are on a soy diet and then Trump would make a speech about why trees can be bad and why we should consider both sides and then put anti-tree in his next campaign platform.

t1_duh0mpd	1	*	I really with they didn't cancel that TV series. I like to imagine it's not too far off what ambassadors really do have to put up with.  ^https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbfZKstsq0I ^https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TyWm1JRqTE4

t1_duoo1lw	0	*	Because Armenia is small and poor and Turkey is big and resourceful. 
t1_duokzuw	1	*	True points. But your opinion that we ought to talk about more restrictions on gun ownership is not moving in the right direction. Law abiding gun owners are not the problem.
t1_duufc9r	0	*	we should freeze Luke Wilson   but if things ever get that dire, I wouldn't know a lot of things. like how to heat my 1 room apartment or get fresh water or new clothes etc. let alone for the million other people here. we need to keep the machine going, there just isn't any option IMO
t1_duacm3w	1	*	Yeah this seems super hypocritical coming from Japan...
t1_duhfk03	0	*	> On geological timescales 1500 yeats is incredibly small  That's kind of the problem with climate change - it's happening incredibly fast.

t1_dusmosf	1	*	You just described Trump
t1_duqaz97	1	*	Borders!  The brown people!  We need a wall!!  /s  Yeah, walls don't stop the real immigrants.  The real bad hombres.   Walls don't stop the money.

t1_duumqgf	0	*	> over its lifespan a single shark will literally generate millions of $ in tourism for the islands  While I agree with you that statement is so over exagerated that my eyes rolled over twice.
t1_duno6e0	0	*	Well, he proposed arming teachers and then went on as if schools are rife with teachers that are former military so any shooting would be stopped instantly by those highly trained individuals.  Then he said he never said that.

t1_dujeg1b	1	*	Lol, well played.
t1_duh63k3	1	*	They're not talking about news. Besides wtf are you even talking about and why is this a talking point? Trump lies all the time, there's no truth in his tweets, at least not truth that's related to the world outside of Lyin' Donnie's head.
t1_dur52ag	0	*	Lol like a year ago you were still gobblin on those balls werent you?
t1_dua5gtv	1	*	Tbh, what is ridiculous in the first place is to call diets healthy, all good diets will be healthy because healthy is the natural state of any organism that is fed what it should be fed. Its not that those diets are healthy, those diets are normal, everything else is unhealthy.   (unless ofc they are referring to some specific and odd diet that allows you to live 10 more years and stay young longer, say caloric restriction?)
t1_durcu1m	0	*	> ah, the kremlin scenario again. people being on holiday. how long does russia think the world is fooled by these obvious ploys?  russians on holiday in Crimea:  We liked it so much we decided to annex it.
t1_dua5gt0	1	*	What I really love are the people on shows and the radio acting as if the only solution to this problem is the either put guns in schools or train kids to confront the shooter. 17 people died yesterday and on party wants this to blow over a quickly as possible. The other is too scared to make it a leading issue.
t1_du9zhin	1	*	I think its betting your house on a pair of 2s with high card 5 for the UK. NK is is trying to play Russian Roulette with a Desert Eagle
t1_due0amd	0	*	Well, you see: People from wealthy, relatively modern countries want the up-and-coming nations of the world to *not* benefit from their natural resources in the exact same way those people have been lucky enough to benefit from for their entire lives - to their extreme benefit.   It's a fun hypocrisy to watch. 
t1_duxhrcs	1	*	ahhh yeah. if she did interview with NBC - and its not aired, it is likely NBC couldn't verify any of her claims.
t1_durvsym	1	*	o rly

t1_dur78pk	0	*	I'm maybe wrong but your comment sounds like  you are implying that this parading is solely directed  against USA, while it's more about preventing future nuclear war and as a reminder to the world that the risk and consequences are real.

t1_ducswo9	1	*	Well they went like. Holy fuck someguys are talking shit in twitter I will use all goverment power and might to hunt those fuckers down! Turns out that those guys were Russians
t1_dubnr62	1	*	Sure, if you assume that what they want is the territory itself and completely disregard the fact that their interests lie in being a major player on the global stage without having to kill their own in a war to do it.

t1_dufwheh	1	*	>  a sledge hammer of hate  Yep.    People from the other side of the political spectrum are not just wrong, but are out and out EVIL for thinking differently.  Put a label on someone and there's no need to look at what they say, much less actually discuss it.  See that here on Reddit, from both sides.
t1_duhj8uf	1	*	And I guess the world has only existed for 5000 years too, since evidence from the past doesn't count? /s
t1_dur9xeg	0	*	Curious why you think Trump is unwilling or unable to listen to other people?    He's clearly a narcissist, but if anything I would say one of his strengths is that he acknowledges and seeks out the advice of smart people.  A big criticism of his that I've heard people on the left say often is that he too easily listens to other people and can be easily manipulated.  So which of these do you think he is, if either?

t1_dug3clq	0	*	Sovereign states also have to follow international law, and abide by treaties that theyve signed. They have to follow the UN Charter on Human Rights, for example, if theyve signed it.  Unfortunately its difficult to enforce because the only options are diplomatic pressure, sanctions or literal UN-backed invasion, and the latter never happens because its disproportionate. Doesnt mean that it shouldnt be followed.

They lie just to get to the next day or even hour, regardless of the consequence of those lies. Now some of these guys are feeling the actual consequences of trying to lie their way out of an investigation.

In 2017, Arctic sea surface temperature was 7.2 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than the 1982-2010 average in some areas, Osborne said.  Did even read it? No, I thought not.
t1_duj5om7	0	*	Israel boycotted South Africa when they were an apartheid nation, and now South Africa is returning the favour.  Similar to how Israel condemns European nations and America for building border fences, yet the Israeli border is essentially a fortress. These kinds of hypocritical do-as-I-say-not-as-I-do proclamations are only going to come back and hurt Israel in the long run.
t1_duibo07	0	*	I took a job with a British company to work in their expanding US operations. They complained so much about my salary which was average for the US, but in the UK pays 1/3rd as much. When I would visit for work some basic things were much more expensive. I had thought it would be fun to work in Europe but there's no way I could maintain close to my quality of life there and wouldn't be making it up with extra savings to boot.

t1_dubmdfu	1	*	Russia needs money, I doubt Putin himself is suffering much, if at all. The biggest cost to him is probably political discontent as a result of the sanctions effect on middle/lower class Russians who can't absorb the hit so easily.

However, by the time the insurance companies realize that this drug that is approved to be filled with a $10 copay has shot through the roof, they have already raked in 100 years worth of profit at the old price. There is a good show on Netflix called Dirty Money that has a segment that highlights this.

t1_durhlq6	1	*	Manafort is cooked. He doesn't have an iota of a chance beating the charges. So why isn't he cooperating with Mueller. Two reasons come to mind.  First, he's hoping for a pardon from Trump. Which would help him for now - until the NY State DA files similar charges against him.   Second, something or someone scares him more than the prospect of living out the rest of his life in a jail cell.  My money is on the second.

t1_duhhftr	1	*	By setting up the Ministry of Truth, obviously 
t1_duqk8ot	1	*	Perhaps the quality of the deal will yield quality information to take down the big fish.
t1_dum2k2t	0	*	Where do Mexicans vacation?  They all leave the country?
t1_dua6od9	1	*	The problem with the US is that violence is apparently so rampant that people are afraid to be killed or raped in their own homes. It's something I can't even fathom as a German, because that just doesn't happen here. It's an endless spiral of violence...no idea how you could even fix that now. It's too late imho.
t1_dubml0z	1	*	Nope, Tide ad. 
t1_duojci7	1	*	Depends of course. Playing the devil's advocate here, I've heard that there were some Europeans harassed by Brits and increased after the brexit referendum. Maybe that's a cause for some to flee.
t1_dux8l0x	0	*	When your ideology pushes you to place a crockpot bomb on the side of a marathon, Orwellian can be kind of a stretch. Its not a law against ideology, its a law against terrorism. Theyre not going to take Muslim kids away from home for practicing Islam and theyre not gonna take catholic kids away from the IRA. Theyre taking the kids away from home because of drug paraphernalia, illegal firearms, and hazardous material. Perfectly reasonable.
t1_dui310o	0	*	Or globalize taxation.
t1_ductbpm	1	*	I believe it was a baker's dozen
t1_dud8lja	0	*	Hopefully your girlfriend is okay
t1_durrp1j	1	*	And yet, no one has the RIGHT to have their channel aired. If the platform doesn't want you, they can kick you like a soccer ball. And you're free to create your own platform so as to keep spreading your message.
t1_dufsjh3	1	*	I thought they said it was an Italian Australian family 
t1_due5eag	1	*	I love the law. Id like the accountant who works for the Vatican to have his diplomatic immunity waved so he can actually be tried on charges of child pornography.   If youve got a couple accusations of improper actions you arent put in that job. If multiple different people told my boss I stole money it would be stupid for him to not move me away from the money.   You dont have to just let someone accused of molesting children keep hanging out with children. 
t1_duwa543	1	*	The counter argument is always how do we know that mankind is  causing it. The journalists and scientists of the world are doing a terrible job at answering this question unfortunately
t1_duy080f	1	*	>the letter from the iteret
t1_dumwlzr	0	*	Are there any studies that relate a persons predisposition toward a drug when given the placebo? A belief that something will work or not greatly affects whether a placebo has an effect.
t1_duu3k8u	1	*	He acting like he be Rump. Our ruler is enacting plans to cancel the next election for our national ruler so well be Rump-ruled until he dies. 
t1_duozvxt	0	*	I'm not surprased at all. I'm working in Moscow, and i can say that 99,9% articles of western press about Russia, internal politics, sutiation are pure lie or twisting facts. 
t1_dupn22y	1	*	You even pay tax on pension that had been accumulated from your already taxed salary.
t1_duwp6y9	1	*	On the flip side, those hypothetical kids may be the ones who help to fix the world and bring it back from ruin.  Not likely but not impossible.
t1_duqu5xg	1	*	> different from treason  Well, to start, one is [treason](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treason) and one is [conspiracy against the United States.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_against_the_United_States)
t1_duwo31v	1	*	Haha. I had the same thought.
t1_duictek	1	*	> Manafort obviously isn't the big fish  What if Manafort is the big fish and Trump is just a puppet? Why would it be obvious that that isnt the case?
t1_dunbuq2	1	*	And outsourcing the manufacturing to China,  and point fingers at it yelling about pollution! 
t1_dutu49l	1	*	I guess it isn't Trump r/worldnews and r/politics should be so worried about huh
t1_duk69rt	1	*	They are presently building two. They should go online soon.

t1_dujzm29	1	*	Bargain from a position of weakness?     Bold strategy, Cotton, Let's see if it pays off.   
t1_dumkqnw	0	*	Lord, what did you think of the civil rights movement in the 60s? Get a reality check. 
t1_duvzc4k	1	*	I feel like this is the most likely scenario. On average humans do not value intelligence or education, and have complete apathy to things that are not an immediate danger. Combined with good old fashioned greed and nothing will stop the planet on it's path to quickly  (on geologic time scales) becoming inhospitable to humans. We just won't have the resources to colonize another world, there's no profit to be had. End of the line.
t1_dulwi77	1	*	IMO Scumbags get funding.  Good people don't.  Good people make deals with scumbags to try and do some good, while trading a piece of their soul.  They keep making deals telling themselves better me than a scumbag in this position until they are entrenched or moving up and the money/power becomes too great to lose and they will make any deal to keep it.  Absolute power corrupts absolutely.
t1_duw9zd9	1	*	Calm down Stalin 
t1_dul88vi	1	*	Even a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step. Lets ballpark it to 2000 steps to a mile, then a journey of a thousand miles is 2,000,000 steps. Or basically the same difference between a million trees and trillion trees. Does that justify never taking the first step?
t1_duj8lck	1	*	Holy shit yeah they are like the US 25 years ago. Won't touch a fish just cause it was in the same water as fish Dicks.
t1_dutise8	1	*	Or it makes you disfigured, blind, and deaf. Maybe that builds character?
t1_dutisee	1	*	Before wide spread vaccination measles had consistent death toll of ~2 mil/year.
t1_duhrqzy	1	*	This dumpster fire is directly contributing to global warming!
t1_dude8co	1	*	Welcome to the US media system, where small things are made into mountains of indictable meaning and big things arent discussed at all.
t1_dutg6wn	1	*	My friend just went to Mongolia to play the nba there. He left after like 3 weeks haha. Not his cup of tea I guess. 
t1_dugt7da	0	*	One of the most trustworthy papers in the world mate.
t1_duqxftg	1	*	Fearmongering 101
t1_dudj2ni	1	*	 There is a sentence in count one that states, together with those kno an and unknown to to grand jury did intentionally so it seems there are other people,  not included in this indictment who could be indicted separately.
t1_due413d	0	*	You make good points. I agree with much of what you said. The thing is that you are effectively telling Jews that they cannot live in Iceland. Circumcision is a key facet of the Jewish religion. It is not negotiable in most cases.
t1_duy6hth	0	*	I was wondering who was going to get the land.    This doesnt seem like it will help the little people at all.
t1_dubrg8u	1	*	It was earlier in theory only. Now they have observed it practically using a new sensors and confirmed the theory.
t1_dul92dm	1	*	Here in the states it happens 1-3 times a year over chicken nuggets so.....
t1_dudtat8	1	*	> what will solve the problem of rising crime and gang violence.   https://youtu.be/owI7DOeO_yg
t1_dulu4or	1	*	Well there is a communist rebellion going on and growing so I'm sure he won't be popular for long
t1_duhmf6s	1	*	not just prioritizing... they were actively killing the competition.
t1_duaadyj	0	*	isolationist in what way? Japan contributes aid to other countries, actively promotes its popular culture and sends peacekeeping troops abroad. 
t1_duxj3ro	1	*	Hope so.
t1_dumo9ey	1	*	Could we just save time? Issue each desk with a handgun in attached holster, secured with a metal chain so the student can't take it with them. This bold move (sponsored by the NRA) would no doubt eliminate school shootings. Also keep those teachers on their toes.
t1_duqjatq	0	*	That is the whole of the problem. Oil is facing possible extinction on the horizon and present concerns are positioning to be the last to sell premium fuel before it entirely collapses.
t1_duglx0m	1	*	Trump has such a truth allergy.
t1_duyloxl	1	*	He sounds like a teenager seeking a date for the prom night.
t1_duh16kz	0	*	Gun deaths should probably be counted as unintentional injuries, right?
t1_dugckbh	1	*	How did this not end in violence? Were the parents ever identified and internet-shamed?
t1_duq7920	1	*	Cocaine.
t1_dur1nw9	1	*	And spend It to  build a fucking wall and epuip teachers and kids with AR-15s to kill other kids with AR-15s , which is the shit hole again 
t1_dupq3sm	1	*	They could buy new chairs for the office, or a new copier.  Or turn it in for a 15% bonus...
t1_ducmw62	1	*	Yup, I live in US and pretty much have 0.1% hope of ever owning a home.  A friend of mine is in the process of buying a house, the last time it sold was 20 years ago for $28,000, he's about to pay about $320,000 for it
t1_dui4kgi	1	*	I had to look up what curling was, I'm even more confused now that they need steroids for it.
t1_dugg59z	1	*	>  its his job to take advantage  
t1_duy6w45	1	*	Brah this is Zuma's wet dream...
t1_due68qx	0	*	Whenever you go through US customs on a visa they take your picture and scan your fingerprints.  Even if they have a phony visa facial recognition and fingerprint database would flag them and then they win an all expense paid trip to Cuba. Guantanamo Cuba that is. 
t1_dutjtd8	1	*	Are you really suggesting biological warfare because some people don't think the way you think?
t1_duwg79x	1	*	Natural phenomenons can still be caused by unnatural (human activity) causes.  It's like saying that earthquakes are a natural phenomenon, except sometimes that are caused by shit like fracking or underground nuclear tests.
t1_dujm419	1	*	Can you tell me why he won't publicly talk about the meddling at all though? It's clearly a big deal yet he won't enforce the sanctions. He straight up said he believed Putin when told that Russia did not meddle in 2016. Why won't he make this a serious issue when his citizens are very concerned. I don't care if he didn't collude. He's ignoring a serious problem and making it a story about how he didn't do anything wrong. 
t1_dup457a	1	*	> Fake news, NEXT please.  No, it's not.  Sen. Trillanes making those claims certainly happened.  A Senator making a claim like that is newsworthy, whether or not you want it reported or not.
t1_dunwwdn	0	*	Paper...straws? I'm having a hard time imaging how that looks
t1_dub2qld	1	*	Thats nice, now compare their murder rate with the US murder rate.

t1_duzbkja	1	*	At least this time the transgression occurred at a hotel?
t1_dumh1tg	1	*	How much is US giving per capita compared?
t1_dui9j34	1	*	> The key is to de-globalize capital.   Either globalize fully or don't globalize at all. Allowing corporations to be borderless while people are trapped within borders is a recipe for disaster and exploitation.  If you are going to remove borders for the wealthy and their corporations, then remove the border for the people. If you are going to keep borders for people, then it's time to reintroduce borders to corporations and end multinationals and globalism.
t1_dulz3kk	1	*	Yes.
t1_duprvt4	0	*	Got my car broken into one night in the TL because I made the huge mistake of not using a parking garage, for some reason. Those filthy rat bastards stole my good Tupperware, my peacoat, and my girl's new skateboard. The streets are lined with shit, piss and needles but I wouldn't dare say it compares to slums around the world.
t1_duhjrsf	1	*	Climate != Weather https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/noaa-n/climate/climate_weather.html  (Good to see NASA doing what the EPA is not)
t1_duaujyc	0	*	I'm more upset about how corrupt Barnaby is, and how everyone else turned a blind eye to it. His gf got two different high paying jobs, not ever advertised to anyone else. They got free rent in their love nest from an Influential millionaire electorate member. He has spent tax payer money to visit both families on holidays. All of which was kept secret and when the media uncovered it, they all play dumb as if they had no idea. That is what pissed me off. 
t1_duqog7i	1	*	nunes is just a useful idiot?
t1_dudvx5k	1	*	I would say that insurance companies probably wouldn't want to pay that much, huh? Perhaps they could come together and, maybe, ya know, sue some fuckwits for price gouging?
t1_duh8nbo	0	*	I think it goes basically everywhere the president goes when he's on the job (not sleeping, washroom, etc) to make sure the country's nuclear capabilities are always active

t1_dugvdee	1	*	Russia made him President. 
t1_dunparz	1	*	And they want trump to ban guns lol
t1_dulj6a3	1	*	Because it hasn't happened. The ruling party made a decision at their conference that it would be on their agenda this year. That's where it's at at the moment.
t1_duq81h3	1	*	No, we're looking at this all wrong. Giving money to the NRA is the only way the Kremlin *can* support America and American freedoms.
t1_duze541	1	*	I think her surnames Fish in some slavic languages.
t1_duiwd7a	0	*	You say that like there is any difference between GOP and Russia.
t1_dur4fis	0	*	Beautiful comment here. We are talking about the Americans throwing two nuclear bombs on civilians, but Japan should accept their atrocities.
t1_duglb90	1	*	I'm down with it. They didn't consent to it but it's my religion for fuck's sake. How can they dare oppress me?
t1_ducuk6q	0	*	were the Americans that helped Yeltsin get elected criminals?  
t1_dute41s	1	*	This shouldn't be a surprise. He's been consolidating power for quite a while. look at what is happening with the military for example. I think he wants to be the next Mao. This doesn't look good for ordinary Chinese people. 
t1_duhx9vw	1	*	They're not saying there was more change 1500 years ago, they're saying it's possible to estimate the amount of ice over the past 1500 years, and there's never been a time when ice has decreased as quickly or as much as it is now.  They sampled ice cores and permafrost, and the margin of error is large, but the change in ice now is even larger than the error bars.
t1_duhf0c4	1	*	Circumcision hasn't been banned   And likely won't be banned
t1_dujhohj	0	*	The welfare stuff and accepting all refugees no matter what was mandated post-WW2, Germany has no choice. I think Merkel did up the benefits to refugees, which is arguably a bad move for the economy...youre already forced to spend a ton so that every other European nation can shovel their refugees at you, spending even more seems redundant.
t1_duoxjxn	1	*	Diplomatic Immunity   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwC_IaY3BmY
t1_due7140	1	*	Similar things have happened to people in the hospital. They send you the full bill on the off chance that youll pay it. Worst case scenario, they pretend it was an accident and get you back to your lower rate.
t1_dua6bre	1	*	The irony being the bendy bananas rule was copied directly from existing British standards.
t1_dugp7ev	0	*	If you let killers walk free and they kill again, its on your concience. You are partly at fault knowingly let an unstable killer into society where they can harm innocent people. That's why community exists in the first place. Go hangout in some shithole where killers roam the neighborhoods. Those aren't communities people feel safe raising a family in.
t1_duqkhxd	1	*	That reminds me of the movie with I think it was Matt Damon who plays a guy who flips on lyceme fixing.

t1_dumivni	1	*	The students, duh.    ^^^^^^^^/s
t1_dupk8j4	1	*	Xd Germany isn't doing great things at all. Shitty education system, biggest low wage sector in Europe.
t1_dux4mok	1	*	Speaking the truth right here. Tax drugs and use the money to help people. 
t1_duglap7	0	*	Blowjobs maybe? Foot massages? Gift certificates to Red Lobster? 
t1_ducm95q	0	*	Is it addictive or are people just so tired without it they feel like they don't have energy?  I never thought of it as an addictive thing before.
t1_ducqfoc	1	*	Let's not forget that it isn't just Russia doing this. Companies do this to advertise their products. Hell, actual real-life Trump/Republican supporters do this.
t1_ducco0p	1	*	Operational issues aren't military secrets. They are public problems that come from the civilian government's attitude toward the military. 
t1_ductz86	1	*	welcome to reddit. goodbye!
t1_ducs552	0	*	Huge on Reddit, for sure.   #bernieorbust

t1_duizxq9	1	*	What is a reason for being homophobic ?
t1_dugrkno	0	*	It also takes one google search to look up Dabiq and the other bullshit ISIS spews. And frankly, Goebbels would be proud of those jihadis.  I don't want to defend her, but when you're lonely and depressed, and then someone comes and treats you well, you tend to trust them...
t1_duxujkh	1	*	They already did this morning. At the same time they called them prostitutes again. They've also lodged formal complaint over the term sex slaves
t1_dusqwrn	0	*	You know that his rival for the presidency a few years back, was put in jail after Xi won, and he's still there.
t1_duz5opz	1	*	Yay, techno-optimism. Not.
t1_duvnxsk	1	*	Sorry but Thanks Obama isn't how people actually act, that's just right wing simpletons.
t1_duv1bp2	1	*	> 43 is mild, no matter where you are.  Not really, given that there are places in the world that *never* get that cold. People who have lived there their entire lives would not consider 43F/6C mild.  Not that that changes how bad this is.

t1_dud7j9c	0	*	You found out that 13 russians were shitposting on Twitter during the election. Are you dissapointed with the findings or do you really believe that these tweets were all it took to sway the political opinion in the United States of America?

t1_dumbgiz	1	*	Not going to happen when doing it the wrong way is rewarded with huge profits.    
t1_duj6cy0	1	*	Not universally, bit they've been bombarded with anti gay Propaganda for a long time now, so obviously it works for many, and creates an anti gay sentiment in much of the country
t1_dus2332	0	*	This is also why a two-party system doesn't work in the long-run. If one party is failing/corrupt/no longer leading the country as determined by the constitution, then regrettably it just becomes they said we said between parties rather than a true national discussion.
t1_dudc434	1	*	Thanks for keeping people updated man, I was there and [recording](https://youtu.be/fssGHhvOMX0) when one the same size hit in September and it caused a lot of destruction and fatalities. I really hope everyone makes it out ok this time.
t1_dudwdve	1	*	It literally says in the sidebar that US domestic news shouldn't be here. Bizarre.
t1_dupwmpd	1	*	They only *just* got caught because the mastermind behind their doping regimen spilled the beans.   The IOC went back to reverify the samples from Sochi and noticed that their unbreachable sample bottles were very much opened, and that the clean urine samples were very much tainted.

t1_dui9hpx	1	*	the atheists want to live life where they don't have people in charge using religion as a reason to push an agenda.  just like you don't want islamists using religion as a reason to push an agenda.  shit son, it ain't hard.

t1_duibzdd	0	*	Tax cuts were for everyone, not just the rich. The working class have benefitted. Wages gone up. Didnt left wing individuals want that 15 dollar minimum wage?   Which country should the USA take a lesson from? Which country does it best in your opinion?  
t1_dunosfq	0	*	As a normal day Russian, for us, my coworkers and friends this doesn't mean much we don't see him as a actual candidate he appears to be more of a puppet to show that there is a opposition not more. We all know Putin will win so we decided to vote for Ksenia Safchak as a joke but this joke might end up like a trump joke that will become a reality.

t1_duj9nfa	1	*	Germany is doing just fine thanks. Haven't had a federal government deficit in years. That, along with record employment numbers, free Uni tuition and universal healthcare are keeping the middle class fat, dumb and happy.  Germans love stable governments and that's what we're getting again, even though SPD members aren't too happy about it.

t1_dutpnb4	1	*	And increased spread of disease while they do so. It puts immunodeficient  people and the very young at risk.
t1_duliv37	1	*	I think that's great. Here in the Philippines , Catholic schools have mandatory religion class and focus most of the time on having faith and strengthening it towards God and Catholicism, even on college level.
t1_dutkgm5	1	*	Navalny is actually more popular public figure. His murder would create really dangerous protests.

t1_dus15xs	1	*	It's not too late. There's damage baked into the system, but not nearly as much as if we keep doing nothing. It's still theoretically possible to keep warming below 2C. We just need to get serious as a species.
t1_duo4cc7	1	*	I think that powerful and wealthy people are becoming better at steering the conversation. They have more information about people and better science how to use that information. Furthermore they have better ways to make their voice appear like it comes from many sides and represents social consensus.  Most powerful and wealthy people will act in the self interest of securing and extending their power and wealth which is best possible in an authoritarian environment 
t1_duewi4b	1	*	I experience one in Manchester in about 2008. I was asleep, the shaking was incorporated into my dream, then I woke up and the room shook back and forth like once. Petty cool and potentially disconcerting.  You usually consider the ground totally reliable.
t1_dum15w6	0	*	Estimates indicated that U.S. would benefit very slightly, and it would be a huge boon for Vietnam. Actually. 
t1_dugbwwo	1	*	They werent blaming Obama all those times there were mass shootings on his watch. 
t1_duj093i	1	*	One could postulate that since the outcome is determined, then the issue put forth to achieve said outcome was *the reason* people voted for it. So, it will convince people that the majority of the country are against this Other. Then, when trying to further solidify power in the future, just turn to this Other you've created through the manipulation of confirmation bias.  Maybe. I dunno.
t1_duxdvew	1	*	Only three clicks down before bringing up Trump in a world news thread dedicated to China.   Thats good. I was nervous Reddit was going to be able to talk about something else for a minute.

While the French also have a protected freedom of expression, it is not as strong of a protection as that enjoyed by Americans.  Yet, what is described above would clearly be illegal in the United States.  They invaded and blocked access to a business.

t1_dusnxaz	1	*	Agreed. Thought I was going crazy reading what some of these people were claiming and writing. 
t1_dur50b9	1	*	I'm confused. Lets say Russia did it and it's clear. What happens then? You can't really undo the election cause then Russia would sponsor people they don't like and get caught so they're disqualified for using russian money.  Is this so certain people will be put in jail? Can't members of the NRA say they didn't know the money were from russians. And the Russians who handed it over just go back to russia before being caught?

t1_dudjz31	1	*	yeah, america sucks, you want it to suck more by allowing foreign interests to influence our elections?
t1_duhlyor	1	*	interesting
t1_duq3p86	1	*	Everything he says always comes full circle
t1_dur8yiz	1	*	And who is gonna enforce that? Would your  country send trops? No one wants to get involved because whatever happens in the future is gonna be blamed on them.
t1_due4pic	0	*	My husband was talking about a rape case asking why dna/blood work was needed since the victim was able to identify her attacker. I told him it's bcs people can and do make false allegations knowingly and unknowingly and if the alleged attacker had an alibi, then dna is an absolute necessity. A person's word is not evidence of a crime. 
t1_duy985l	0	*	Gulag for life for a crime which did not threaten anybody's health or lives ?  if you apply the highest form of punishment for largely trivial matters, does that not water down real crimes like mass murder and the likes ?
t1_dui9sue	1	*	Its basically a data-gathering front now.  As long as people keep using aol emails they can keep scanning them for keywords and selling peoples data to advertisers.

t1_dun5ynf	1	*	Many industries rely on single use plastics, the lead time gives them the opportunity to figure out how to replace what they currently use something more environmentally friendly for example you or I could stop using plastic bags overnight but a super market can't,  it needs to figure out who can supply them with alternatives and at a quick enough rate to meet demand.

t1_dulathc	1	*	No there was still disgrace here. They still used the French parliament relocation to seize power and sign a peace treaty with a foreign power they openly admired. Handing over half of France while doing so and selling their allies down the river.  Ever wonder how a completely different leadership signed the armistice than the one that was elected? People don't call it a coup as technically everything they did was legal.
t1_duu5rlt	1	*	I don't think that's something you should involve all of your peers in
t1_dutazv0	1	*	Angela Merkel has been chancellor of germany for 13 years now. Is she a dictator? I prefer having a good leader for extended period of time, than a joke-populist moron, anyday. Democracy in the US is a joke. You can't achieve shit in 8 years, let alone in 4.
t1_dupd4r8	0	*	Would be great if germany would actually invest in those things now
t1_duebmxs	0	*	Probable.  But, don't forget Mueller and his team know much more than is public, and they are unusual in Washington in being fully capable of keeping secrets.  In addition, if these indictments are an indication,  he demands that they be very tight and well done.  He will serve no wine until it is time.
t1_dus2u0z	1	*	Because the Trumps have been tap dancing around the technical letter of the Bobby Kennedy laws.
t1_dumlmuq	0	*	Remindme! In 365 days about this
t1_duuum5f	0	*	Honestly the most effective thing you could do would be to donate your time by volunteering for a non profit or go there yourself and personally help someone..  When I was in India we 'volunteered' to go hang out with some very underprivileged kids and you could tell it really meant a lot to them.
t1_dud027e	1	*	Or maybe just a greasy breakfast.
t1_duotbjo	1	*	If he was found not guilty they can't keep retrying him. If the case was that weak you have to wonder why they proceeded.
t1_dujm0fm	1	*	If he actually believes Obama could have done more to prevent Russian meddling in the 2016 election, then he needs to take some strong, clear steps to prevent Russian meddling in the 2018 midterms.  Does anyone see that actually happening???
t1_dup6uyl	0	*	It's russian embassy, that means no security, only vodka.
t1_ducwa09	1	*	The vast majority of posts are seen by less than 10 people. If these 200,000 tweets were mostly fairly visible, then they may be a decent chunk of the most popular tweets.
t1_dueewo2	1	*	The BuzzFeed consumer base needs the training wheels. Everything they post is either some eye rolling clickbait, or stating the obvious in an shocking way. 
t1_duw46un	1	*	no you'll be vaporized.
t1_dupzawz	1	*	Germany also does public-private partnerships better than America. In the US, government and private enterprise are rivals / opposites / mutually exclusive but in Germany they're two parts of a whole that work together. 
t1_dudx8u3	1	*	Now that that's legal in places the illrgal stuff will probably be at least $500 cheaper than the medical stuff
t1_duhmn4f	0	*	Your article is talking about *Ant*arctic *land* ice, the OP's article is talking about *Arctic* *sea* ice.
t1_dub24s2	1	*	Yeah but it's about mass shootings. People still find ways to stab inmates even in a supermax wing so yeah violence is always going to be a thing but mass shootings stopped in Australia after the ban.
t1_dupkvx6	1	*	Get more refugees
t1_dumol4z	1	*	People aren't thinking big enough!!  Teachers need to be armed with nuclear weapons.  No school shooter will dare commit the act if they know that all teachers have the power to unleash nuclear hell in retribution.  Trump's been keen on nuclear quite a bit, saying we should use it more.  What a perfect way to put it to use!  Then maybe we can send some teachers over to North Korea and solve that whole mess too.  
t1_dupifyu	1	*	Gotta get that money. 
t1_dunhnvi	0	*	Uh, you clearly didn't read the article. This isn't over a memo, it's over someone fired for responding to the memo
t1_duujoub	1	*	All developed and some developing countries do that. They go fishing wherever they want, especially along coastlines of countries that can't protect themselves nor enforce their laws. If developing countries had what it takes to protect their coastlines and enforce their laws, seafood would be considerably more expensive.

t1_duf6lkh	1	*	It wasn't always this bad.  I don't pretend like I know what led to this, but the Russians (and others) are going to exploit it if they can.  We need to go back to the days of intellectual debate and, when necessary, agreeing to disagree.

t1_dugf38b	1	*	No sir you don't understand, religious freedom is a euphamism for the right to impose our beliefs on others. It's a misleading phrase because it implies that those who voluntarily surrender their capacity for free thought are capable of understanding or valuing freedom in any way.
t1_duaz7d5	1	*	Our dear president Trump does that all on his own, bubba.
t1_dust8n0	1	*	Fuck.... I'd like to think I'm pretty well versed in history and this never really even occured to me. I felt something was off, but now I really see it.
t1_dudtr03	1	*	It's not that that price was never meant to be paid, it's that that price was meant to be paid by an unfortunate few, unbeknownst to them, whales. These minority consumers are subsidizing the majority. It's becoming the norm across a multitude of markets. 
t1_dumr67a	1	*	Most importantly they burn trash for fuel in some poor areas there's a great guy named Dr Elly I came across in Uganda who is aiming to fix that. I can post a link if there's interest.
t1_duauvi1	1	*	Why would the US help them develop? Chavez just stole all the stuff after they build it up. No wonder multinationals would rather not risk investing there with Chavez jr in there...
t1_dusglmo	0	*	How so?
t1_duja17y	1	*	Good. Teaching people how to do things for themselves is a far superior option to treating them like children and doing it all for them.

t1_dukqhwt	1	*	If anyone wants to know what groups are actually here it is Faylaq al-Rahman, Jaish al-islam, al-Nusra, and local bands of fighters who fight under the FSA banner. The most relevant being JaI and Rahman Corps.   While the groups are extreme you have to remember that many men just want to fight assad and will fight for whichever group pays best and has the best equipment/most structure. GCC pretty much only equip radical groups so those groups rose to the top. 
t1_duhir2n	1	*	I know I'm a little weird but I prefer an environment in which human civilization can survive, not one that supported 3 foot tall spiders and wouldn't be breathable to humans, so I'm not terribly impressed with the climate has been different before!

t1_duqpza4	1	*	Shame that this is at the bottom of the thread but there is definitely a similarity between the recent NRA propaganda videos and the Russian misinformation campaign.  It's been obvious for a while that the NRA basically exists to raise money for the GOP by brainwashing the base but they've obviously stepped it up a notch in the past year. It's probably the fact that they can't use the gun grab approach but who knows.

Because as someone else mentioned, there's KSA but they haven't pretended to be democratic, and their clampdown could be considered legal (so the issue then is that there's something wrong with the law). But over here, the law enforcement are themselves breaking the law (kill first, even if they are not armed - a weapon will be discovered eventually).

t1_dukvh5k	1	*	Me, you should see what they did to the blowhole.  That's not romance.
t1_dues72c	1	*	That's a bag of worms...
t1_dutlukl	1	*	You'd have to know how much, but sure. Finding that much substance would be difficult. Simply because the pollutants have been a byproduct, not the product, of our industry and have built up over hundreds of years. Producing that much akaline substance would require it's own production line and investment, matching 200 years of industrial growth and carelessness.
t1_dui381s	1	*	They seem to be recovering slowly. Went to Greece on my honeymoon and everyone seemed very optimistic but still hated the government. The people on the islands work their asses off during tourist season though, dont take any days off 
t1_duvfeds	1	*	>Trump seems to not know that: (choose one of millions of options).  FTFY
t1_dui6k8u	1	*	What's 'life admin'?
t1_dud26dx	0	*	This has zero to do with the government. Try reading the article first.
t1_dup1hrr	0	*	I have a feeling you wouldn't listen to anyone, no matter how many people your policies selfishly send to the grave. You're evil. 
t1_duqfses	0	*	Probably because there is something to this. Feel free to disregard anything that makes you uncomfortable.
t1_dutolvx	0	*	Obvious bait is obvious.
t1_duo8g3s	0	*	Problem is, you never gain a freedom back once it is taken away.  There is no trial gun ban.  Once they do it they won't undo it.  How do we stop them, we have no guns?
t1_duquvpq	1	*	It's in Karachi,  Pakistan as well. 
t1_duqaut3	0	*	Do you remember when Colbert set up a SuperPAC? Apparently it very easy to hide donors. 
t1_dusscbe	0	*	Especially when US is failing to be the check and balance
t1_dujmy7h	1	*	At least they aren't asking for people's thoughts and prayers. Yet.
t1_dukavm9	1	*	Yup, it was essentially a money grab for globalists to throw U.S. cash at impoverished countries. Wouldn't have done shit. 
t1_dutdc3n	1	*	Lol
t1_duhyu9u	0	*	It's not our trash. It was their own trash, which they were salvaging for personal gain. An activity which is dangerous to your health even at the best of times, and deadly in this instance due to the heavy rains. Proper waste management or even site security would have prevented this.
t1_dusxbhx	0	*	Didn't Gandhi sleep with his underage cousin or something?
t1_dukxdia	0	*	That was my first thought too... not sure  Edit: just went and checked. Radiolab guy was named vital or something like that. Not sure how to spell it, but not this dude
t1_duyjqix	0	*	It should be better prices now, right? (as opposed to 'in the long run') You're not paying for packaging....
t1_duhnkyt	1	*	There are several ways we can tell, it's not just via satellite data. The margin of error *does* increase the farther you go back, but not to the extent necessary to make this all an unknown 
t1_duhnkyj	1	*	Climate denying morons, whose paranoia is legitimized by climate alarmist fanatics.   
t1_duhdd7o	1	*	I keep posting U0001f438 on their social media.  For those who can't read emojis it's the Kermit the frog drinking tea with an alarm clock.  The time is coming for these corrupt POS.
t1_duqmaii	1	*	> I can't for the life of me figure why he is still holding out.   Perhaps he can prove his innocence. There really isn't another reason why he would burn all that money.
t1_durhc3s	0	*	Dude, or girl. I think its dumb to blame Malc for Barnabys load shooting. He cant control what grown MPs do. 
t1_dup6o4e	1	*	> This latest crisis made me realise, Australia hasn't had a stable government in more than ten years.  Australian government is very stable. The leader is what is being changed frequently, but the leader isn't that important as long as the party is still functioning. It's based on the British system after all.
t1_duqtdad	1	*	I'm thinking it's time to plug all those pesky holes in the second amendment.  Edit: take back Congress and the supreme Court will be of no consequence.
t1_dub6617	0	*	Yay Nutella...  Edit: yay Nutella! Ive been informed the ethically source their palm oil now. Cool!   But fuck creme filled cookies and personal hygiene!
t1_dur5hhi	0	*	A quick google took me to https://www.croptrust.org/take-action/   I'm not 100% sure that they own the seed bank but they do contribute to it.
t1_dudujkh	1	*	I was prescribed a pill that would've cost only a couple hundred less than that per month. A helpful nurse aided me in getting the same meds for zero per month, and they were delivered to my home. It's mind boggling.
t1_dux60gp	0	*	They werent incentivized, people bought them mostly due to fuel mileage as the prices between a gasoline run car and a diesel one are pretty close, unlike the US. Repairs also werent costing more as diesels are common. The downside to diesel is the rough idle, like you remember from the school buses, but that has been improved greatly. 
t1_duwoikz	0	*	Ive been trying for a while to find any reason why the US is deployed there. The only thing I can come up with is continued real world combat experience and weapons testing. No policy explanation makes any sense to me. 
t1_dur8ebc	1	*	It's happening right now to somebody who is reading here lol. Some of those men treat the women better though, depend on their luck I guess.
t1_dudtos7	1	*	Just like how baggage fees were a temporary measure to offset high fuel costs. 
t1_dudtosb	1	*	Random fact: a successful revolution only requires 4% of the population.
t1_dun6eux	1	*	Didn't he own an island???
t1_duoznz2	1	*	Or Narcos.

t1_dukeuvy	1	*	Fuck Russia.
t1_dub6ed3	1	*	> is internet trolling nowadays used exclusively by Russians?  This seems to be a new trend online.  Take a comment and then claim it means the most extreme thing you can.  There are an array of groups actively trying to influence online opinion.  Doesn't mean anything about what Russia is doing.
t1_duslzg7	1	*	Ignoring him would have worked at the beginning of his presidency. The floodgates have been opened now.
t1_ducgtpq	1	*	It is certainly a possible solution but even that comes with some risks. Unless the EU is aggresive with their policies, Indonesia may take a soft position as being enocuragement to continue the practice. Unless the regulations are strict moving forward, it could only encourage these farmers to continue to burn down forests in place of these palm oil fields. Keeping the door even half open gives the belief that things very well may not change. 
t1_duu5c19	1	*	The missiles are probably aimed at US bases in Japan.
t1_dubvmyn	1	*	I didn't.  Went back and read it again.  Still didn't.  Upvotes anyways
t1_duj7o38	1	*	They probably worked on this problem for years, but couldn't keep it quiet, because they needed to implement water restrictions for households.
t1_dudcgo8	1	*	It was all just an act to achieve power.
t1_duhmbv2	0	*	Something floating on the water will displace EXACTLY as much water (in weight) as it weights and melting a Kg of ice will result in 1Kg of water so no raise in level.  [If you don't believe it...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOCqHRpQh88)  You managed to flunk Archimedes to correct scientists, congratulations!  You should also consider that a lot of Ice is not floating (Greenland, Antartica)... where will it go when melting?
t1_duoz48h	1	*	I laughed. But then I made myself sad. Don't give these people ideas. 
t1_dup70fa	0	*	Now they're hacking the weather!
t1_duyrcfj	0	*	Nice knee, whore!
t1_dupbm8d	0	*	Just my opinion but I have a feeling it wasnt full companies of Russian mercs. Was probably made up of mostly Syrian troops led by a few advisers. 
t1_duh0xq4	1	*	You do realize this has happened before?   It didn't make america great last time either
t1_duu5bgu	1	*	Well, it's not as bad as this: http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/tiananmen-square-massacre-death-toll-secret-cable-british-ambassador-1989-alan-donald-a8126461.html  But it's still about this bad: https://www.cnn.com/2016/06/23/asia/china-organ-harvesting/index.html

t1_dug6lhb	1	*	Israel doesn't give them a refugee status this is the whole problem
t1_dugeruv	0	*	Until we find out where the wood comes from, we can't conclude that it promotes deforestation.
t1_duyg89l	1	*	I don't like JT but your whole comment is so stupid that my IQ dropped a bit after reading it.
t1_dushkaa	0	*	The Trump needs to pay their fair share. The US is the only nation that wants the wall built, the only nation that will have it on its soil and the one that has ordered it, it has nothing to do with Mexico. No more free rides.
t1_duw1hk3	0	*	I would find the first graph more helpful if it plotted +/- 1, 2, and 3 standard deviations as well. As a casual observer, I have no way of knowing if the current warmth is *that* much warmer than normal, other than taking your word for it. 
t1_duhacuy	0	*	According to a person familiar with those talks  Jesus Christ. Is there such thing as a source anymore?  EDIT: honestly fuck all the people to hell who downvoted me for questioning a horrible source. You should all want better journalism. This is pathetic. 
t1_dukbtfu	1	*	She comes from a long line of holocaust deniers  In the 1990s the far right in Europe donned pin stripes and moderated their positions using simplistic, populist politics to gain electoral support, FN was very much part of that movement, while Marine Le Penis has made a show of kicking daddy our of the zoo they are the same ethnic nationalist scum they always were, it doesn't matter how much lippy it applies it's still a gorilla in a dress
t1_dubj5yi	1	*	Haha. We build them for no reason and are stocking them in the desert. They can buy them at cost plus 3%. I call that fair. 
t1_duknov2	0	*	It's absolutely stupid to name it after him.  My first reaction was Trump actually had trees planted?  No, it's the Anti-Trump forest, or anything other than naming it like one of his branded properties.
t1_dulezmz	1	*	https://www.plasticbrickautomaton.com/?id=29
t1_dut7rgo	1	*	How it works is that any debate in China is held behind closed doors by the upper echelon of the party. Im sure this was debated and voted upon by the ruling class, and Xis supporters came out on top. The Peoples Congress simply rubber stamps these proposals into law, so this is as good as passed.
t1_duw5yk1	1	*	oh my god you're so dumb.
t1_duxuyr7	1	*	Civil war before that and what do you think will happen?  
t1_duq7edt	0	*	Agreed, but it's still a shameful prison sentence, people sing songs about the IRA in the UK all the time and no one is arrested for it.
t1_duqdo0o	1	*	What about the millions donated to the Clintons by Saudi Arabia?  That country is pretty backwards when it comes to womens rights... https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.nytimes.com/2016/08/21/us/politics/hillary-clinton-presidential-campaign-charity.amp.html
t1_duhiz7b	1	*	Yes you can. You're in a Tide commercial.
t1_ductms0	1	*	This is a big point. Upper education, particularly university/college is supposed to be an exercise in critical thinking. Specifically learning HOW to think and ask questions. To literally question everything and formulate your decision on the facts provided. Unfortunately it seems like there is a growing change. Away from true academia, and HOW to think... into indoctrination and WHAT to think. and this can be said about both the left and right.
t1_duk4sj1	0	*	So the meme is going to be thanking Trump for good things that happened in spite of him and thanking Obama for bad things he had nothing to do with?  Fucking racist memes
t1_dule1t5	1	*	Trump and Duterte both like riding bareback.  Something i didnt care to know.
t1_dugv3ee	1	*	Cant have a cake and tweet it too 
t1_duk2tir	0	*	Stupid is as Trump does
t1_dui3rqe	1	*	oh that makes sense because it's not like literally every single historic site in the world is vandalized in ENGLISH  but yeah, blame others
t1_duc06xy	1	*	Modern commercials? 
t1_duf5tm8	1	*	>the US interests  Yeah, because trying to set up democracies, with all of the massive costs, is really selfish.
t1_duy1x4u	1	*	username says it all

t1_duq73jw	1	*	Heres more money.  No, thanks. Were too ethical.
t1_dud8bzr	1	*	Beeing: the act of being a bee     *Also what the hell is it with this constant misuse of the word troll.*  An internet troll is basically a prankster/provocateur, motivated by personal gain or for the lulz.  This definition dates back all the way to usenet, newsgroups and BBS boards.  It has nothing to do with PR companies, psyops or astroturfing.  Those are called shills or astroturfers. Not trolls.  
t1_duqcg5u	1	*	I'm not sure government policies using fear and death to enforce compliance work out very well
t1_dua3x0t	1	*	I think the same about Trump and Clinton voters. 
t1_dubbmlg	1	*	Good luck getting in, they shut down travel as soon as this news broke out

t1_duw2usk	1	*	there is a good reality show here
t1_dubtqwe	1	*	To make each site as extreme as possible and thus making it harder to communicate about those topics between people with different opinions?  At least it feels to me that such a thing is happening, you are either against or in favour, can't be in between anymore.
t1_dupem5l	1	*	teachers, who can get fired for being mean to students are now allowed to determine if they should die. this can only go well.

t1_duwco68	1	*	Probably, men are reporting rape too these days.
t1_duy8i7l	1	*	It's every American's duty to block and filter all input from outside our border. Reddit needs an ''Americans only'' button, so we only see USA comments, so no meddling foreign hacker comments influence our fragile minds.   I heard there's a blue and white website where they let anyone comment about anything, from any country in the world! *gasp*
t1_dus0pde	1	*	There's a magazine you might like, called *drum roll* 'Ancient Egypt'
t1_dur7x79	1	*	Fewer birds to eat the insects. 
t1_duy2erl	1	*	And when they scuttle their country and come to mine with their hands out that's how much I'll tell my congressman to give them.
t1_duj500r	0	*	whats the difference? 
t1_duvsi7b	0	*	You have to even read a few paragraphs in to the article to get to that very small portion where they casually breeze over it. This post should really be labeled as misleading.... Because that's what it is.  Really, 0% of the plywood could be from a rainforest. Just because you can't prove it, doesn't mean it has/n't been. It could be anywhere from 0-87%.
t1_dud55uv	1	*	Easy, anything that was pro gun. Because Americans hate guns so much that they would never tweet about defending their 2nd amendment rights. Sarcasm of course, but this is how they actually do it. When you get called a Russian bot, you know the other person is an idiot. 
t1_dut50wx	1	*	*yet
t1_duq47k7	1	*	I will agree with you that it is typically watered down in my experience maybe they water it down during the day and are tainting it at night.
t1_dugv2di	1	*	Ah, so are historical connections really something that democrats want to get into? Like slavery, Jim Crowe laws, and the KKK?  Because if thats how you want to frame the world, Im sure those with an (R) next to their name would be happy to oblige.
t1_dusmxzi	1	*	They can afford the politicians so never,
t1_dua75jc	1	*	But muh self defense! What if an evil robber mass murderer psychopath serial atheist killer comes to my house and tries to murderburglarize my family? Of course I need 10 weapons in my home and they have to lie around, couldn't get to them quick enough if they were in a gun safe, duh!
t1_dusktu5	1	*	> Most Americans are aware that America First is hate-speech  The world is laughing at you. Whoever tells you what to think is an idiot.
t1_dugldlo	1	*	Its called politics. They are all scumbags. Who cares if trump used Russians for help. Obama used help from millions of illegal aliens and no one ever talks about that.

t1_dub1dyu	1	*	Well, we had guys who [drew gigantic penis](https://img-fotki.yandex.ru/get/9229/91337623.7/0_10d7ee_bb8a12d3_orig) on one of the drawbridges in St. Petersburg as a political protest.

t1_durdawt	1	*	you dont. but there are more people on this planet think china's human rights are better than the Americans.   Americans have the rights to get shot and murdered by your own people - this could happen anywhere, anytime.

t1_dujg8nc	1	*	Or,  as Trump calls it, a slow Friday. 
t1_dud71c2	1	*	I completely agree.  It seems to me that Americans have been interfering with other countries elections for a long time.    I would like to see a report on the similar things Americans have done, and only then will I consider condemning these Russians.

t1_dut6rxk	1	*	The president doesn't even have as much power as people like to think. 
t1_dunm9if	0	*	We did it to ourselves.  All of our current governments are designed around putting an ungodly amount of power into the hands of a few key individuals with the assumption that these people will act with the best interest of their nations or the world.    It might be time to consider that our problems aren't from who is in charge, but that a single person can carry so much authority.

t1_dumda0s	1	*	> Politicians still get on top of people and still get away with crimes they commit.   Because they are bought by very wealthy power-hungry people. 
t1_duzd9io	0	*	Not really.   Neonics work by binding to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. Low level activation of these causes nerve stimulation (see: cigarettes), but high level saturation causes paralysis and death.  The thing with neonics is that they react much more stronger with insect receptors than to mamal receptors. As such, they're not that toxic to humans.

I suspect that if you aren't introduced to the concept at a young age, your brain just naturally wires itself to focus mostly on satisfying whatever urges pop up at the moment. I don't think they are doing it out of spite, but because they can't really conceptualize the consequences of wiping out a species.

Energy drinks have 400% of the daily recommended dose of some B vitamins. Kids drink 4 or 5 of them. Sometimes daily. That's bad. Some also have more sugar than Coke.   It's not the caffeine that's the issue. Coke, chocolate, coffee all have caffeine. But they are too high in Vitamins to be consumed as a soft drink, instead of just an energy booster.

t1_duyv4ws	1	*	I'm still open to the idea of votes being hacked, and definitely against Trump, but you have to be fair in this argument. 50 states times elections every 4 years means that you expect 3-sigma or more events every so often. The math tells us that. (Now if its a 3-sigma event in more than one state, or several counties suspiciously run together its a different story).

t1_duebr2g	0	*	They have had many posts acknowledging that Russia did meddle in the election. The narrative that the Trump admin colluded with Russia to undermine the election is what is contested over there. This latest news does nothing to further the case that Trump admin colluded with Russia. That said the investigation isnt over yet and there could be more still to come. Guess we will have to wait more.
t1_dupqif7	1	*	The CDU is in no way a better Republican Party, the most comparable party would be the Democratic Party. The CDU is center right for *German* politics, which is much more left wing than American politics. The CDU would be a far left radical party if its poiclies were brought to America. If anything this is more proof American liberals are right about healthcare and education and the economy.

I sometimes wonder if it was worth it for his family. Him, sure, hes old and wont have much longer to live, so not really much in the way of consequence for him. But his family will have to deal with the fallout for decades to come. Like, I cant imagine Barron is not getting bullied for his father.

Mueller is simply trying to find out who, if anyone, did anything. And most of this results in people lying about this or that. And all of these people will walk. But he's not aiming directly for the presidency.  That would be stupid on his part.  If something comes up, then he would look into it.  But so far, nothing.

t1_dur8mi4	0	*	True, but one continuously wonders what Trump fans must be thinking and feeling, as all of his promises, deflections, and fantasies crumble apart.  Wasnt he supposed to be the isolationist president, taking us out of all these Mideast adventures, because achieving peace is not as difficult as people think?  My point being that hes consistently full of shit. And Id like to hear from his supporters about why they continue to back him.

t1_duvtsq6	1	*	History does not flow backwards, but China is culturally very well acclimatized to strong and even brutal central governments.  Mao is still largely revered.

t1_duepdvn	1	*	> Europe will also hate if the US ends poverty and state violence.  Wait, what?
t1_dui9zwj	1	*	My thing is, if the rich rich were taxed more would the tax rate drop for those of us under the $250k/yr mark?  Or would it just mean more government funded things, like fancy high speed rail and schools that are actually good, etc?
t1_dunizpi	0	*	Maduro is a fat ass. He should be called the Supreme Eater
t1_duggct4	0	*	The UK is the Reek to Trump's Ramsay Snow. They need trading partners, so they have to sidle up to the guy who said he'd fuck Diana if she took an AIDS test first. But hey, at least they won't have Polish people working in fast food!

t1_dulr8gw	0	*	No no no, you have it all wrong. Trump does bad and mean things and says bad and mean things. That means the US (and, by extension, all Americans) can't make any sort of moral judgments on anyone else, even if the anyone else is this case is a murdering strongman.
t1_duai536	1	*	Had a concrete basketball court close to my house that had the slickest ground in certain spots imaginable. Was unplayable. Had the idea to spray paint a bunch of dicks and obscene shit to force them to resurface it.  Never got around to it, though.

t1_duk9qlk	1	*	Isn't it really demanding(resources wise) to create forests in areas that were never a forest? I imagine maintenance for these forests aren't cheap at all. People always blindly upvote these things without questioning it. 
t1_dueqgxu	0	*	South Korea was a brutal dictatorship until.. quite recently.  It's still not a liberal democracy on the level of anything in Europe.
t1_dubyo4b	1	*	Most likely, reason for this war was Qatar natural gas pipeline to Europe. All other reasons can't even remotely compare in the level of impact. As you can imagine, this pipeline isn't happening soon and Gazprom and Russia seems safe.

t1_duqi703	1	*	If the intention was to give it to him through the NRA, that's conspiracy.  If a criminal conspiracy has been established, individual actions which may not necessarily be illegal themselves are no longer viewed in isolation but as part of the conspiracy.

t1_duwkhoc	0	*	That sounds like a lot, but if this person is saving multiple lives a day I would say that it money earned
t1_dud1ni6	1	*	But saying these people acted through unwitting members of the campaign team makes collusion more difficult to sell too, unless there are a whole other batch of Russians with which Trump did collude.
t1_duv2z69	1	*	For some perspective, I was in a Fraternity, and almost every single member has said after they joined, they wished they were Hazed harder. I'm not condoning or denouncing it, but it's viewed as part of the fun. Nothing was crazy, you get yelled at, have to do stupid shit, big deal. But it's an experience that forms intensely close bonds with those you've gone through it with.   edit; Obviously the stuff included in this article is grotesque.

t1_durbbzd	1	*	As someone who follows this conflict closely its actually believable. They are called the Wagner group and they've been in Syria for years... longer than Russia has been. I remember a few years ago they had an unequal run in with ISIS (trying to defend oil fields in the East) and it did not go well.  The area they were attacking is near some SDF occupied oil fields. Their local warlord paymaster wanted them to seize that oil.

t1_dudmfza	0	*	As someone who has studied Federal regulation of pharmaceuticals in the US, the underlying philosophical goal isn't affordability or quality but rather incentivizing drug companies to develop new drugs.  The thinking is if a drug company can make billions, they'll try harder to develop life saving drugs.  Now, obviously that's not really what happens but that's at least the rationale used for things like drug monopolies and orphan drug incentives.

t1_dubyc1z	0	*	It is. Without getting too political about it, say what you want about China - but the capability to plan and actually execute projects like this is rather jawdropping.
t1_duqb5l2	1	*	Or she's reading from a prepared speech, just like any person with a schedule would do?  Besides, other than the mandatory remarks to appease their local populace, none of the Arab/Muslim states actually objected to it. Jordan and Egypt are still cooperating just as fine with the US after the embassy move thing, and the relations with the gulf states were practically unscathed.

t1_duy6n8e	0	*	How comfortable are you with the status quo? (The 'status quo' being major mass shootings grabbing headlines every couple of weeks.)  What steps, if any, do you think should be taken to reduce firearm-related homicides in the United States?

t1_duljzgv	1	*	What kind of proof would convince you?  The Police uses questioning and interviews as proof all the time. 
t1_duw3u9w	1	*	its cheesy, but the idea has been around as a consequence of climate change for awhile.

t1_dun2dnu	0	*	TimesofIsrael is a fucking propaganda website and should be banned from /r/worldnews. They routinely makeup bullshit that makes IDF look like white knights on the international stage.

t1_duwys3s	1	*	It is the new scare tactic to revoke people's rights without criticism. Erdoan's administration has done it to dramatic effect in Turkey; basically any opposition to the AKP gets labeled as being terrorists these days.  Autocrats are merchants of fear. They sell you the idea that you are under attack and ask you to give them more power in exchange for protection from their fictional threats.
t1_duwulik	0	*	Read the article. They want to consider online posts as terrorism. 
t1_dukht2b	0	*	I doubt this will save many lives. If anything it's just Trump trying to appeal the masses.

t1_dunjsdz	0	*	> I wonder what drove it  *One* thing I think is China. As China has grown and developed super rapidly, their authoritarian model has become more and more appealing when compared to the democratic free societies.  I think China's model is flawed in many ways, but as they broke through the myth of 'only democracies are able to achieve economic success' many countries began to rethink their heading.

t1_dul1pba	0	*	I have to be honest, if this headline said Trump mocks condom use because 'they don't feel good' I'd probably believe it. 
t1_dumterh	1	*	I'm not attacking you so I hope you don't misunderstand my tone, but countries without constitutional gun rights also don't deal with so many school/mass shootings and gun deaths per year so from our non-American perspectives, our law of no guns allowed make perfect sense to us and we see that you guys don't understand that. 
t1_durmkc5	1	*	It seems that people here are completely oblivious about what was happening in China in the period leading up to ww2 and during the actual conflict. There was extreme barbarism committed by everyone there, the Communists, Nationalists and other factions. 
t1_duydr2b	0	*	As far as prison, probably.
t1_duywqg8	1	*	Regimes usually do that when they are super-insecure and don't think they'll have the ability to hold people long-term. Otherwise, prisoners are always better than corpses since they can be used as bargaining chips or to make sure the families behave.
t1_dursy1c	1	*	they were right on creating the playground that allows most of the mass killers to be able to kill a lot of people? They would not have been capable of killing that many if they lived in a proper first world country, that's an obvious fact.

t1_dumxv71	0	*	I'd say 2019 minimum.  Depending on what happens, the ramifications could spawn investigations for years to come.  The potential case is unprecedented.  Mueller's team has hardly been utilized yet.  Even things like Nixon's investigation took forever.  When Mueller took down Enron's CEO, it took 4 years.  This is nowhere near done.

t1_duid6ec	1	*	The only way they could further push it is with it being conscription to the navy!   Force them to spend months at sea only other seamen, living in cramped quarters, that will make them change their way!.  
t1_dub6ix6	1	*	I'm honestly not sure why you'd expect it to be any different, and I don't think it has anything to do with the times. It's just how for profit companies operate.
t1_dujnc78	1	*	I mean, I dont think he is capable enough to intentionally lie this much. Like, it takes a certain amount of prolonged focus to always purposefully deceive people in your favor.   At this point its gotta be some sort of certifiable condition.

t1_duicr3r	1	*	If the billionaires are getting more benefits then couldn't we just do away with income-percentage-based taxes and have the government send everyone a bill for the services they use? Whatever government programs rich people are benefiting from would cost more to subsidize the costs for welfare and basic necessities like public education, roads, and police that would be otherwise too expensive for poorer folks to pay for.

Even with subsidized daycare and food stamps, they barely stayed afloat even with a full time job, and they also had mommy duties after work so they never have the time, energy, or money for education or training.
t1_duy8xg7	1	*	Counter populism! Kill the populists! (This is a joke, for all the people without a sense of humor) 
t1_duiwzmx	1	*	Cause then Florida will run out of water. 
t1_dub6277	1	*	Well if you work for a factory or a city/town propped up by your membership in the EU and voted to leave you might not be that bright.

t1_durva01	0	*	> ramped up media stories and leaks with a propaganda campaign. And there has been quite a bit of that recently  To clarify: you're calling an npr story reporting on the deaths of 500 people, over 120 of whom were *children*, needless propaganda?
t1_dupjbc9	1	*	And Germany is the largest supporter of EU. It would be nice if this problem would be recognized before the problems take over the merits for the importing countries. Even in EU prevails the corporate sortsighted thinking and Germany seems to be holding on to it's superiority like self-made millionaire
t1_dudqfvx	0	*	In Germany it would be $3-5 recipe fee completely independent of how expensive the medicine is. And even that fee is capped for chronic illnesses.
t1_dul1ho1	0	*	Seems like something that could be covered or at least touched upon in a world history class anyways. 
t1_dui2b38	1	*	Eh, generations are sometimes used as cum rags for other gens.  No reason to think this gen will be a great gen.
t1_duoucsp	1	*	There have certainly been larger busts in Florida. I remember a shipping container had a few thousand pounds in it a few years back in Jacksonville. It is probably the most ever found in an embassy though lol.

t1_duey02k	1	*	Reading this right now. Every American should read this book.
t1_dusqylu	1	*	this isn't exactly shocking though is it. the moment someone tries to pay you money to kill someone you can make double blackmailing them to not reveal they offered you money to kill somone. who can they appeal to? at that point why risk a murder rap when you can get more risking a blackmail rap? and by definition everyone involved is either a treacherous or murderous player.   it's simple game theory.

t1_dug8yk4	0	*	Yup. They're not there to make a point and there's nothing to gain by hosting this in their embassy rather than GW University.  >The Foreign Office confirmed that it wanted to keep a distance between its diplomats and the parliamentary inquiry. Given the independence of the committee and its inquiry from the government, it would not have been appropriate to hold public evidence sessions in the residence,

t1_dunjfs2	0	*	Assuming he's being legit about imposing new sanctions (and I'm not holding my breath) I would guess it's because he believes the specifics of the original sanction bill would no longer be effective.

t1_dui91ml	1	*	There are very few places where they could move that would offer a similar standard of living AND fewer taxes.  So, to answer your question... no, I don't think it would lead to people leaving the country.

t1_dusvk7p	1	*	Yes. I stared at it for way too long, and now my heart is filled with a deep and terrible sadness.  There is a little girl that grows up in a warzone. And there are millions more, all over the world. It breaks my heart.  What the hell are we doing to ourselves?

t1_dulwrxu	1	*	The thorny issues are very difficult to talk about without creating controversy for either side
t1_dullenv	1	*	Controversies are interesting, if you are seeking clicks you lure both sides.  Think of the opposite, you wouldn't seek clicks from one side of an argument that no one much though mattered.   If you were seeking to weaken a country, you could surely come up with a more effective approach than posting stupid stuff to social media.  I bet they're not being divisive, they are just seeking clicks.
t1_duncard	0	*	A lot of western and first world countries violate human rights. We are just used to it, for example: the death penalty is considered a violation of human rights by most countries (for example as ratified by the ECHR), but it is still existing, even in the US. Same for torture and war crimes  (Guantanamo or Abu Ghraib for example).
t1_duun5xv	1	*	Argentinian naval vessels are even more decrepit
t1_dudpzmv	1	*	Except that as long as humans do not go extinct we will keep the planet in a perpetual sick state. A pathetic shadow of the paradise it once was. So we must either go extinct or try to make it better.    And I wouldnt underestimate our capability to survive. At least a few of us could probably make it through the worst extinction events like the KT or PT by hiding underground in artificial environments and repopulate the planet in no time 
t1_dul7zae	1	*	youre always at risk when you are the citizen of a relatively high risk country, the government of Canada has at least SOME leverage to protect you or to seek some sort of redress if something happens to you in essentially every other country on earth, but when you are the citizen of that nation, the government of your other citizenship, if it is even recognized at all, is essentially powerless.

t1_dujaosj	1	*	Before this thread it only had about 10,000 views. Hardly viral
t1_durd1an	1	*	I'm pretty sure that the last few times were because of the rebels breaking it.   Infact the last  cessation of hostilities here was directly broken by the rebels who attempted to capture the syrian go held vehicle depo the other week.   Similar things with the last few Hama offensives.   Not to forget the southern fronts last attempt at gaining ground.

The point of taking philosophy courses is to actually learn and explore different ways of thinking and being. You learn how to write, speak and compose yourself. Those are skills that are transferable across different professions that doesn't show its benefits immediately.

t1_dukgk09	0	*	Source?
t1_duormdx	0	*	It's not that. Russia is just a country where organized crime, business, and the government have all merged together.  Getting diplomatic appointment means you got political connections, which often means organized crime connections, so as long you support the right people, you are untouchable. It's pretty much the same as the feudal system.  If that's the case, why not make some easy money?

t1_dui8rcp	1	*	Yep moving capital and jobs is bad, it is better to tax it more so the government can send more military aid to Israel, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Qatar. Also the government will also need money to save the banks the next time they shit the bed so we need more taxes for that. And don't forget the army those Lockheed Martin contracts aren't gonna pay for themselves...

I'm kind of just spitballing here, but i think the main reasons they move to different countries are less regulations and often times cheaper labor.

t1_duqg8v9	0	*	Approximately 100 million people would agree, gun control sucks balls.  Gun control/seizure isnt feasible now, because a whole bunch of countries did it in the 1900s and then proceeded to massacre a shit ton of people.  History is a wise teacher.

t1_duq3uuo	1	*	I think modern bodybuilding satisfies that request

t1_dukd6yq	1	*	Not only would that be the better pun but Trump Forest sounds like something he could easily take credit for and have people associate it with him like that. 
t1_duhvbzs	1	*	No ketchup, just sauce. Raw sauce. 
t1_dulu043	0	*	No idea how you reached that conclusion or that number. Why 10-15, and not 1-2? Or 100-150? There should be a peace process when it's in the interest of both parties. Currently, the leader of neither party thinks peace with the other party is in their best interest.

t1_dunf4i0	1	*	His experience is relevant to the situation. Its a point of view on a continuing story that I actually wanted to hear. Its not the end all be all of the whole discussion, and I agree I want to hear more from teachers. 
t1_dul4lsu	0	*	I lost you at Assault Rifle.  Educate yourself before making an argument.  edit: how about you ask why I said that before the downvote?  But of course its too easy to do that instead of educating yourself and knowing what an assault rifle is and how hard they are to really own.

t1_duz7hhd	1	*	Yes, all the ones we found have been perfectly safe.
t1_dudsrg5	0	*	I voted for Donald Trump because while Hillary was passing out, draggin' toes & being chucked into med vans like a side of beef, Donald was bossed out, hoppin' highway dividers to bypass idiots protesting on the highway and get to the GOP conventions.  It was evident who was competent at running the country at that point.  No russian facebook posts required.
t1_dunw97j	0	*	Gun control is extremely board and can mean anything from expanded backround checks to repealing the 2nd amendment. Break it down to specific proposals and there is large variety in the level of support.

t1_dub4zsn	0	*	No, internet trolling is not exclusively performed by Russians, there is propaganda from numerous countries, movements, institutions and so on.  However Russia has nearly perfected the art of dezinformatsiya.  The Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg engages in online influence operations on behalf of the Russian government, these are paid commenters and bloggers.

t1_duxykuh	1	*	That's the sad thing, a vast majority of middle/left won't cover anything that touches stuff that goes against the agenda so you are forced to filter through toxic sludge websites to find glimmers of truth, sad terrible as they may be the fuckers hit it on the head sometimes.

t1_duimj97	1	*	yea, stamina in curling is big deal
t1_duib87w	1	*	You understand very little about how the economy actually works but ok.  Lowering taxes and putting back money in you pocket isn't goin to work well in the long run.
t1_durjp2z	0	*	A lot of Western leaders despise him. Trudeau ignored the guy when they sat next to each other at the ASEAN Summit. Hell, even Eastern leaders think hes a joke. Cambodias hierarchy is so corrupt... I hope something changes soon for the sake of our people.

t1_duy6gow	0	*	We could have an honest discussion about how under 8 years of Obama he left the door open for things like this around the world and this is a direct response to a lack of real American leadership for 8-9 years.  Or  We could blame Trump somehow.  
t1_duslbfc	1	*	Moderately pathetic, probably near the middle in the long list of the pathetic things you've said and done today.

t1_dusincv	0	*	As utterly pathetic as all Reagan Republicans should feel at all times. Your ideals are selfish, short-sighted garbage. Consider this a wake-up call that Republicans never, ever do anything in your interests, and never will, and every time you vote for them or argue for their policies you confirm your idiocy.
t1_duptcy5	1	*	Waste it on the military!
t1_dueqckl	1	*	From where I'm standing all of the liberal leaning statements the pope has made looks like a very effective pr campaign to distract away from sexual abuse being covered up. Liberals can't stop fauning over every left statement he makes and the majority quit being critical and took to social media to praise the new pope's liberal views. Ive seen it on reddit, I've seen it in social media. You've got it backwards. 
t1_duw7q54	1	*	I'm sure you've read all the eulas you have come across. Also, I live in Europe so they don't mean shit and can't restrict us.

t1_ducwo61	1	*	> in the indictment  This specific indictment.  One of several in this investigation so far.  Probably not the last.  This one may not contain those allegations, but a later one might.  Let's wait til the show is over before we absolve Trump, shall we?
t1_duezguf	1	*	They are complicit and have colluded.
t1_dujdlti	1	*	No they dont deserve sympathy... However you should shed a few tears for the justice system as mob lynchings greatly undermines it. The two animals should have been tried in court as is the law.
t1_dund0cr	1	*	Exactly. He didn't do anything even remotely close to what Duterte and Putin do on a daily basis, this Trump hysteria is way out of proportion. Apparently you can't even trust what Amnesty says anymore.
t1_duwb4de	1	*	If it's too cold they'll just go back to Iraq. 
t1_dudqvga	1	*	Because enforcing that is impossible and is so open to exploitation.
t1_dumnred	1	*	He is aligning himself with China and away from the US

t1_duhx5tg	1	*	In Scotland? Definitely not, they will make perfect chibs to do folk in mucka
t1_duist5g	1	*	At least that means we have twenty more years of English real estate shows where two old white people shaped like pumpkins buy a castle to retire in based on the resident caretaking Mrs Cottlesworth's quince paste quality.

t1_duuub64	1	*	THANKS. Came only to say this.

t1_duphal7	1	*	Also they dont bankrupt individual citizens with healthcare and education costs.  
t1_duelic5	1	*	If you think the Tories are going to fight to retain the high EU food and safety standards that they have fought tooth and nail to block, you are dreaming. They will open the floodgates and get lucrative executive directorships on the boards of the agro-biz companies that they give the deals to.   I hope you like chlorine with your chicken.
t1_dui9djr	0	*	>while commentators spew drivel  Not only do they just babble, but it seems now it's barely anything related to the sport, or helping the viewing experience.  Like curling is getting so much damn TV time but I haven't heard ANYTHING about the rules, like... do they just assume everyone is full aware of the rules & scoring? This is a sport that gets on TV only every 4 years, sorry I'm not caught up on anything above Slide rocks down into the circles, bump other teams out of circle.
t1_dui8emh	1	*	I'd love to see a response to Bill Gates and Warren Buffet from less sympathetic billionaires. Heck, I'd like to see a response from GOP congressmen. 
t1_dufvhxh	1	*	I tried to reason about it for far too long before realising that it didn't make sense because people were being disingenuous. They were complaining about a type of spin but only in an attempt to spin things in a different direction. Also, since I didn't have a side I was apparently against them.  
t1_dul5101	1	*	>Our country is so fucking dumb.  Yep, all you need to do is look at the people who are currently pushing for the government to strip our 2nd amendment rights, and at the same time are pushing the crazy conspiracy theory that the person in control of the government is a secret Russian double agent and a fascist.  Lol
t1_duanjti	1	*	If you think that the wars in Iraq,  Libya, Syria, (Lebanon and Iran), aren't about mitigating Asiatic Russia's energy leverage over Europe,  you probably don't remember the bombs planted on the George Washington bridge on 9/11.  Also see the future of US relations with turkey and Pakistan. And Israel's plan to annex the levintine basin.

t1_dutpi78	1	*	Funny...it used to be that people just wanted to fuck Jenny McCarthy....
t1_duf1k7x	1	*	Russia stepped in, grabbed both sides by the shoulder individually, and said yo, those other absolute cunts said this about you, you gonna take that shit?  Everyone played themselves and Russia's tiny investment is still paying for itself hundreds of times over. Rhetoric on both sides hasn't been this divided since the 1850s.

t1_dun2ctw	1	*	IP's can be spoofed and this sets a dangerous precedent and works against the free flow of information globally. We dont want to be in a information bubble or exclude anyone from accessing it.
t1_duw7wrv	1	*	Yeah, no, you're the first person to wonder when the ice age ended. Scientists do not exist.

t1_dubrwtm	0	*	There is at least some of this type of use, but on deployment ... Have read a very few complaints about Iraq and Afgan deployments, no action, too much shovel work.  I suspect those complaints were tongue-in-cheek.  Who really wants to be shot at?

t1_dumacmv	1	*	Aye  Threat to democracy my rear.  Sometimes the Yankee has to not only go home, but stay home and stop peering out the window with a pair of binoculars. It's nothing more than a political designation to give interventionists the consolation that they did something good.

t1_dudpru9	0	*	I wonder f the Russians paid by the Russian government to carry out the goals of the Russian government against enemies of the Russian government are connect to the Russian government? Probably just a coincidence then that they're being indicted for a slew of charges related to working with the Russian government. 
t1_duq0diq	1	*	This isn't the first time this sort of shit has happened. 
t1_duhkbld	0	*	Just eight hours ago he had a tantrum about Oprah on Twitter.  That would be eleven thirty at night for Trump.  Guess those Diet Cokes and Big Macs required a late night run to the bathroom.
t1_dupw5ga	1	*	As always, the truth is more boring than either of the 2 narratives spouted on reddit.  Germany has definitely gotten less safe since the recent mass migrations. But it was already extremely safe to begin with. I would say that it has moved a few percentage points downwards on the scale from utopia to apocalyptic hellhole.
t1_dujtwa6	0	*	By having fewer military commitments? Sure.  By having military commitment they cannot keep? Eh....
t1_dux98ej	0	*	They never were a democracy and never had freedom of speech. Many Asians in western countries don't even believe in those values.  Generations of brainwashing.

t1_dudsxro	1	*	#metoo
t1_dur173b	1	*	Didn't Trump promise to investigate Hillary after the election? Just more empty promises from him.
t1_duwsqc2	1	*	Good design, good customer service. Oh, and the other companies are just as bad, they just dont get the same clicks or vitriol when their shortcomings are discussed. 
t1_dusmpva	0	*	I mean, their doped curlers coudn't win, so they had to resort to desperate measures.
t1_dulldtq	1	*	Aye, I'm not religious, wasn't at school either but learning about different religions, cultures, practices, history etc was interesting. They were always engaging lessons and it's fine if students want to opt out but I think they are passing on one of the more enlightening and useful school lessons.
t1_dub68vf	1	*	Yeah, and why would this prompt removal of large snowbanks? A guy with a shovel and a truck could ride around scrambling theese makeshift bilboards all day
t1_duvtwb4	1	*	Typical. 
t1_durt9uy	1	*	I mean there is this long ass list of apologies https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_war_apology_statements_issued_by_Japan?wprov=sfla1
t1_duqs0kc	1	*	Wow....literally none of that is true. That's actually kind of impressive.
t1_dulfgqn	1	*	I think comparative religion classes *should* be mandatory. Just as you said - not in a you have to learn about God, you heathen manner, but rather a you really should understand the cultural background of a heck of a lot of the human race.  Things like how Christianity displaced pagan rites, or the parallels between Judaism / The Torah; Christianity / The Bible; and Islam / The Koran are pretty important to understand. 
t1_duljqmx	0	*	chronic heavy drinking. I highly doubt any article told you chronic heavy drinking was good for you.

t1_duhnxl2	1	*	Wouldn't diet modify the amount of ROS created? Don't Keto, LCHF, Atkins (any low carb approach) decrease ROS? IIRC, fat/protein oxidation is optimized to limit ROS compared to carb oxidation.

t1_dusx7br	1	*	Quackurate
t1_duswbi0	0	*	As a human being, I find it utterly appalling that they had kids as sex slaves.  As a Christian, I find it an extra layer of appalling that they'd do so in the name of God.

t1_duv4s7c	1	*	Well there is your problem. We are talking about the current state of american politics. And you think logic comes into play?
t1_duet27k	1	*	Yeah except the AU said the report was completely false.   Why does western media constantly lie all the time to try to drive wedges between China and other developing countries? They obviously don't even like these countries either considering when the president of america calls them shitholes half of the western comments begrudgingly agree with him.
t1_duj6qs4	1	*	Co-habitate can be used for countries, even a planet.
t1_dulwlkf	1	*	>  in western media Duterte is corrupt, cruel and despotic  I slowly started to believe he is a saint or something. Western media is the most corrupt, cruel and despotic phenomenon ever existed in this world. They have the ability to make Hitler himself a hero of the humanity in a few years if they wanted to (and they have proven this time and time again) and also they somehow still maintain credibility which goes to show either their audience is totally retarded or totally corrupt too
t1_duxhdxc	1	*	They don't advertise normally anymore, they let their elephant escape and let the local newspapers do it for them.

t1_duthgis	0	*	Except vaccination status isn't heritable, so no, not at all.
t1_dujea2s	0	*	Not really, Israel almost lost the Yom Kippur war for not striking first. It has been a policy of Israel since forever to try very hard to not strike first, unless it is really necessary.   Also, it was the arab countries the one who attacked first after Israel's independence.   Israel *is* the victim. 
t1_duuimd9	1	*	Not to mention her insanely elitist attitude the entire election. You can't stand on stage and belittle a significant portion of your voting population and the candidate they put forth.  Not a good look for anyone.  Combined with the ridiculous sense of entitlement to the throne that dripped off of the entire campaign and everyone that rabidly supported her it was very difficult to stomach.
t1_duyi4a9	0	*	Big if true. 
t1_duq1sjk	0	*	Link to vid?
t1_dukch3p	1	*	Agreed.  I just keep going back to how outraged everyone was when bush waited seven minutes to move after Andrew Card whispered were under attack.  That was seven minutes.  This has been over a year.
t1_duwwdhs	1	*	Nothing is (on a long enough timescale).
t1_duv2i4j	1	*	Time spent traveling is time not actually fishing.   Might be good bit faster than you think.   Edit:  [10 kn max](https://www.fleetmon.com/vessels/jing-yuan-626_0_10883192/)  so yeah, not fast at all. lol
t1_ducvh2k	1	*	Nothing on reddit is a good use of my time if we're being honest

t1_duxr9k0	0	*	Don't quote me on this but ever weapon (leagal) is registered to your name, so the government knows who owns what and can ask them to give them up. The penalty for not doing so is unknown. It's also based on good faith from the public, I assume most Norwegians will follow this with out to much of a fuzz.

t1_duu7qjj	1	*	>When Saddam did this to Kuwait we sent half a million US troops to kick him out because *their huge oil reserves*  ftfy
t1_duphqyb	0	*	Except they've increased their use of coal power with their idiotic move to shut the nuclear power plants.  https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-11-14/germany-is-burning-too-much-coal  http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/11/13/germany-is-a-coal-burning-gas-guzzling-climate-change-hypocrite/
t1_dufrd4k	1	*	If Donald can take credit for no disasters in 2017 does this disaster make it his fault by his logic?
t1_dupjprk	0	*	are you implying that Germany would revert back to Nazism if they had a strong military again? get a grip fam

t1_dupzlzr	0	*	If you knew anything about European economies, you would know that a German surplus is **fiscally irresponsible**. 
t1_duricf7	1	*	Give them some credit. They'd wait until they had overwhelming public support on the issue, then spend $120m on a non-binding postal vote on it.
t1_duz8iyy	0	*	How are they bringing so many people out of poverty if they pay their people so little? Thats the thing I never understood. 
t1_dubq5op	1	*	Scum
t1_durll9i	1	*	Ya, I was screaming commas in my head. 
t1_dubs3ua	1	*	why would they care?  you're assuming that the end-goal would be invasion, when that is far from realistic given the disparity between Russia and the US in terms of economic power (economic power which has nothing to do with the number of small arms in civilian possession).  
t1_dudp7o9	1	*	Presumably at far greater expense.
t1_dunndz1	0	*	The generation that lived through authoritarianism is dying. There's no one to remind of the evils anymore.

t1_dueiqex	1	*	You don't think that friends of Putin can get new passports under new names by just asking for one? Good luck catching any of them. 
t1_duvxr5m	0	*	Okay, climate change is happening and it may make events like this more frequent BUT THIS EVENT IS NOT ITSELF INDICATIVE OF GLOBAL WARMING. This event has happened with regularity in the past. It is atypical weather, but it is not unusual weather.
t1_duuewzc	1	*	Yeah just an FYI from an English bloke living 25mins away from London, there is no such thing as a no go zone here in the UK. It has literally never been discussed by anyone I've ever met.   Not sure where you've picked that up from, but I'm pretty sure that's either something that the far right have created or some misinformed statement made by a politician to discredit the UK.
t1_dufaz5h	1	*	There's already a divide. Did Russian extenuate that? Probably... But already there
t1_dulmswu	1	*	yeah it definitely doesn't feel as good 
t1_duhixc0	1	*	What do you mean? This is big and everyone should be happy someone is standing up to Google.
t1_dunp44f	1	*	Non of course, but AI needs a purpose so they had to come up with something.
t1_duk14t9	0	*	A huge inferiority complex. 
t1_dupj0jw	0	*	well first off, do you have a boat? 
t1_dus8c6h	0	*	So you think its ok there's people working in the states for terrible wages in dangerous positions? Just because it makes your food cheap doesn't make underpaying people right. Not to mention cheap under the table workers take away power from workers rights and bargaining power.
t1_duq8f4z	1	*	The same reason nothing was done after the financial crisis in 08, and that nothing was done or will be done to equifax, the NRA has a lot of money
t1_dup301y	1	*	About those 5 kilos of cocaine
t1_dud8cky	1	*	A lot of NRA retweets in that database. Considering that the [FBI is investigating the National Rifle Association to determine whether Russians illegally funneled money to influence the election](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/15/nra-russia-and-trump-money-laundering-poisoning-us-democracy-commentary.html) I'd say Wayne LaPierre might want to lawyer up.
t1_durd4gl	1	*	The japanese, unlike other groups of people, absolutely do accept what they did in history and don't play victim moving forward. 
t1_dut98jw	1	*	For the same reason you're getting up and arms about Redding being up and arms about Trump in a thread about China:  A good portion of Reddit lives in the US and cares much more about Trump than Xi because Trump's policies actually affect them personally.
t1_dumckot	1	*	I actually don't think you have the right to leave school unless you have permission from a parent or guardian. Now, whether it is an arrest-able offence is another question.  Edit: looks like no one was arrested, they were just brought back to class by security.
t1_duikbk6	1	*	A fire? At seaparks?
t1_duy9zqx	1	*	Don't you mean in front of?
t1_duh5rjn	1	*	Today the most powerful person in the world is an engineer at twitter, he doesnt know it yet but when he figures out the reddit shadowban + twitter combo hell be saving the world. 
t1_duya64t	1	*	I'll take as many as we can get. We need more people who have seen genocide first hand and know how to stop this nonsense from infecting our politics on all levels.
t1_duabcgs	1	*	Nobody thinks youre idiots. Foreign members of the 1% think its bad for their business. Britain should not be beholden to their opinions. Its sad that you are conflating everybody and rich globalists.
t1_dusxn8m	1	*	Is there any book recommendation on rise of Xi Jingping and why he is able to make major changes like remove term limits but leaders like Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao didn't attempt to do soP
t1_dukn1tm	1	*	It was a good pun, and a terrible idea!  I'm proud. 
t1_duby8n0	0	*	disclaimer- there is absolutely nothing wrong with either form of birth nor with C-section scars. But if you are this fucking shallow and retarded isn't a big surgical scar vs some downstairs stretching kind of 6 of 1 half a dozen of the other?
t1_duofweq	1	*	It's no surprise that the mega-corperations that are the driving force and cancerous backbone of the country won without a hiccup. Even with 80%+ of the population being opposed.
t1_duseeuz	1	*	Is Malia a fashion designer though?  No. 
t1_dur6ylh	1	*	But her daddy is the king and she's the crown princess. Of course she needs to know how the Trump Kingdom^^^TM works.   /s
t1_dubml2o	1	*	I think that's not the point.   They might prefer a disarmed country, but that's a secondary objective at best.   A divided country is far weaker than a one that is merely disarmed.
t1_ducpr5i	0	*	What does state propaganda Fox News,  have to say about Iran? 
t1_duxky5u	0	*	They're hardly trapped there. Kim Jong Un went to school in Switzerland.
t1_dumrdw7	1	*	We should do all of this with drugs, oh wait. 
t1_dur2v4t	1	*	But thatwould mean they had to stop condrming Israel for like two minutes. Can't havr that.
t1_dug19ai	1	*	Does Emirates or Qatar operate in these regions? They're pretty much cream of the crop in terms of having their shit together and they're not too far away.
t1_dudnsqq	0	*	So good they need armor to protect their delicious meat
t1_duopwbr	1	*	>Ban the fishing of blue fin tuna period  It's really not that simple though. You would have to get the Japanese government to ban it then enforce it and I don't think they will.
t1_ducmbrv	0	*	Do you mean pitocin?
t1_dugz0v2	1	*	You mean companies should pay people money and give them free products? 
t1_duvzinw	1	*	Whoever came up with that should have tried it first.
t1_dupuujn	1	*	They expected the market to be worse... a lot 
t1_duk9da5	1	*	Honestly, if that's what it takes to get a vain idiot with too much power to support planting more trees, then I'm okay with that. Knowing him, sadly, he'd likely say a million trees is enough and he's done his good deed for his lifetime. 
t1_duphbya	1	*	Been free since 48' 
t1_durrf0o	1	*	I really hope the DNC takes a HARD anti 2nd amend stance in the coming elections.  Keep the red wave running across America and DC.

t1_dul0i61	0	*	I want this at my funeral.
t1_duz2g5z	1	*	LMAO. He shouldn't have pissed in the elevator, but the way he did it was particularly impressive. Enough piss and high enough to fry the circuitry and shut the damn thing down.
t1_dur2k69	1	*	Well, now that you feel this way, you could always...   Not take loans from China?
t1_dux9upf	0	*	In Europe maybe. You see how Americans are losing their fucking minds over here?
t1_duyhuz2	1	*	Kim Jong-Ronaldo
t1_duhug4i	1	*	They're not saying it melted 1501 years ago, they're saying they have about 1,500 years of reliable data. Before that, it's still known more or less how much ice was there, but not with enough accuracy to make a valid comparison.
t1_duab6k7	1	*	The EU is no different than any other government entity, they and their subsidiaries react with hostility to anyone threatening their power. That's the only problem.
t1_dukqoe6	1	*	Almost like people have to make extra efforts to correct the irrationalities of a market that cannot contain its externalities because of its drive to derive profit at whatever cost to the planet. 
t1_dul6rb5	1	*	Every comedian needs some time for new material
t1_dusrnez	1	*	It is sad that west was supporting Syrian rebels on the road to make a new shithole on the middle east.
t1_duu1mcs	1	*	Me too.  My guess is it's easier to use the Bible as cover than to just say some rich dude whose business pollutes a lot is paying me to say these things.  In essence, Pruitt is lying to hide greed.  The bible has some useful things to say about that.
t1_duhf2di	1	*	118 deaths. Damn. Sorry for your loss.
t1_dun12ix	1	*	You don't sound like a shining example of humanity yourself, dude. You need serious professional help. You have a deranged obsession with President Trump.

t1_duqwqde	1	*	I just want to say fuck the FDA and their insistence on everything having to be formatted in letter size. Letter size doesn't even exist anywhere else.
t1_duy9rnh	1	*	Australia would if the government was so incompetent. 
t1_ducmh76	1	*	 Nothing will come out of it, by Sunday the threats will resume

t1_dua7ll5	1	*	Not all of them have to be idiots. I'm sure a privileged few will profit handsomely from the ensuing disaster. 
t1_dusl8jp	1	*	Oh hell no, cruz cruz, I'm NOT voting for peje...

t1_duj2d12	1	*	Hes gotta be the only OAP that is U0001f602
t1_dudac5p	1	*	Trump seems the kind to be more disappointed that he is now, indubitably, a pawn in Kremlin's playbook. The kind that would rather be guilty of treason as long as the world sees that he's thebest kind of treasonous.  Full disclosure: I'm a never Trumper who never thought him capable of collusion.

t1_dun6938	1	*	Should apply to both but meh.......politicians are equivalent to children.....
t1_dur4n3e	1	*	 >Investigate all the dark Pac money while you're at it.  woah woah there buddy, we just want it to apply to republicans  
t1_duq4r1t	1	*	Sadly you are correct at this point. Giving teachers guns won't help if they're not prepared for this sort of scenario. Personally, I am all for getting these types of weapons out of civilian hands. But until that happens the next best, lesser of two evils is to have properly trained /experienced people in that position, which is in my opinion a horrible option versus getting rid of the combat weapons from civilian hands. 
t1_duluk4d	0	*	If we limit ourselves to only working for people without intellectual limitations, 99% of us would be homeless and penniless.

t1_dutsbn6	1	*	Sure it does. Actions speak louder than words. 
t1_dufx8rg	1	*	true, but just because christianity doesn't have this one issue doesn't mean it would be overall better than the other religions. There's just so much harmful shit in every religion, it's depressing.

t1_duafk9s	0	*	Tow? You know that the entirety of Japan can transform into a mecha right?
t1_dunsyud	1	*	Egypt has significantly less restraint when it comes to Gaza than Israel. When Israel finds a tunnel they spend the money to collapse it, when Egypt finds a tunnel they fill it with sewage which might seem not that bad but its done to create sickness.
t1_dukoc76	1	*	Well the US didn't kill any Russian civilians and only killed or wounded military targets so no. 
t1_duw02xr	0	*	I worry about my kids. My family has done what we could to lessen our impact but my children are going to grow up in this mess and it terrifies me. Life on Earth will be fine, humankind won't pop off for awhile, but the instability, chaos and environmental upheavals...with no way for them to stop it, just seems so wrong. :(
t1_dutw1kh	1	*	The middle class.

t1_dur2kpr	1	*	Depending on the strain of flu virus that you've come down with it may be gone in 24 hours either way.
t1_duq7xzx	0	*	Always look for deflection and whataboutism.  Moving the goal post is another popular one. The mantra for a year was There's not a shred of evidence of Russia involvement. The goal post will be moving every step of the way.
t1_duwclig	1	*	We can't stop it, it's going to happen no matter what we do. We can only delay/slow it. Personal I think the idea we can stop it is one of the big problems alongside those that think it's not happening, we should be focusing on how we will adapt to the new future not lying to ourselves that we can stop it. Mother nature has been doing this cycle longer than humans have been around, we can speed it up and slow it down by a small margin but never stop it completely.
t1_dursz3v	1	*	https://xkcd.com/1357/
t1_duwx8hc	1	*	Well, I can only speak for myself, but kinda?  My plan is to buy up some land way up north, maybe about 30-50 feet above the water level near the Hudson, fortify it suitably, and wait.  
t1_dunbz3g	0	*	But will the government fund the addition of a working dishwasher in my home? I buy disposable cutlery, etc. because the only dishwasher I can afford is ghetto and makes the dishes dirtier than before, and handwashing takes too long and never makes me feel good about the result being squeaky clean enough.
t1_dugsf18	0	*	Servile is the last word Id use to describe him. Did you mean senile?
t1_dufrmca	0	*	>Russia illegal annexed Crimea.  You sound like anti-immigration people talking about the illegal immigrants. Of what relevance is it that something is illegal? Who says it's illegal? Clearly not Russia.
t1_duyg7uk	1	*	But we have it so bad here in the US....
t1_dud0hla	1	*	> David Brock openly brags about paying internet trolls to do the exact same thing and Democrats dont give a shit.   But that was for a good cause. It was her turn.

t1_dur0kyq	1	*	I couldnt give a fuck either way
t1_dust96d	1	*	Well said.
t1_duiad3c	1	*	This is especially true because most of them have nothing to interesting to say and default to a few universal phrases we have heard over and over.  I would say the only 2 athletes i heard give coherent post game interviews were Federer and Djokovic and even that is nothing really special.
t1_durnu30	1	*	What does any of that have to do with warning against the use of nuclear weapons? 
t1_dugid1k	1	*	It's just which media you listen to. Here in Middle East we have some TV channels supporting Assad regime, the things they say about Assad's Syria, Iran and Russia, you would think they are greatest nations ever.
t1_duv0a83	0	*	Kinda wish we had the purge tho...
t1_durckpc	1	*	Damn
t1_duo3xrk	1	*	In a recent debate Putin said that he won't tolerate unrest and that he believes the majority of russians don't a Maindan 2 in Russia and he won't allow that to happen.  
t1_duibk7m	1	*	That's *kinda* how tax brackets work, but it's not that steep and it only applies to income taxes. Most other kinds of taxes are inherent regressive (the less you make, the large the percentage that goes to taxes).
t1_dulpvl9	1	*	Holocaust is usually taught in History classes
t1_duplzcd	1	*	The problem is, that kid's family is really poor, and he doesn't want to work his ass for a good life. 
t1_duqgn64	1	*	I dont think its all Russians, or even all Russian athletes/olympians.   The Russian state has a culture of corruption and I dont think its unlikely that many of these athletes are actually pressured into doping. I'm sure they also get an earful of state propaganda telling them that everyone else is doping like crazy, thus they need to do it to level the playing field. 
t1_dupbz2h	0	*	Old habits die hard.  Russia got very few medals on 2010 olympics. Then it takes first place in Sochi with 11 golds and more other medals than Norway. Now again they barely get a single gold medal.   This makes degree of cheating done in Sochi obvious.
t1_dusyy9v	0	*	I'm really concerned we are heading towards another world war. The writing is on the wall.

t1_duqvfow	1	*	Conspiracy against the United States is a pretty generic tax fraud crime. Not a light crime by any stretch but it is not the offense your are making it out to be.
t1_duvp5px	0	*	Or because they have a homicidal madman leading the country. Of course as a US citizen, I shouldn't throw stones...

t1_duskguy	1	*	Mexican here. We consider EPN the dumbest president we have had.   Id still have him over Trump any day. 
t1_duiqrsv	1	*	UN wont do much but give a strongly worded speech
t1_dut7vhe	1	*	Neither do they in India or U.K. In fact no commonwealth countries have term limits for prime ministers. Because they are parliamentary democracies. People don't choose the prime ministers. People choose which party rules. Then party chooses there leader. A party can stay in power for as long as people want them too.   
t1_duogv9k	1	*	They don't say anything because they don't know about it. It's not really a double standard if you don't know -- that's not what a double standard is. A double standard requires you to know and consciously choose to treat one differently.

t1_dumjc4u	1	*	A mixture of both. Almost everyone with access to College education hate him, as his supporters generally come from the uneducated and easily manipulated masses. Fun fact the same masses that support him, are the same masses that have become the victim of the Drug War. He also hires online trolls to silence any who criticize him, and make it look like there is a lot of support for him. Don't get me wrong though, a lot of the middle class and the upper class still have support for him.

t1_duyfk41	1	*	Florida was very weird. They started with the rural votes and Hillary was in the lead and when they came to the urban votes she all of a sudden lost. Yet urban votes usually always go to dems.   Clinton won Houston, Dallas and Austin in Texas btw, a deep red state.

t1_durdbn3	1	*	more whatbaoutism.. this is pathetic
t1_duk12hs	0	*	We don't know. It is too early to say anything for definite. Until Trump is named by Mueller we will not know. It may turn out Trump himself did nothing. But again it is too early to say that. All we know is members of his team have been breaking the law. Everything else is speculation.
t1_duqkddg	0	*	*Daddy horny, Michael*
t1_duexztd	1	*	And foreign propaganda.

t1_duyx7z3	1	*	I look forward to how much library shelf space will be allocated to books on Trump and topics related to Trump. Sadly one will be in Psychology called How America elected a Narcissist
t1_duyl5c7	1	*	There's been too much crying wolf, too many completely unhinged predictions with no serious evidentiary basis and obviously political motivations, for people to take this kind of talk seriously. 
t1_duqzmyw	1	*	Yeah...but guns are sold to military corps.
t1_duaj74x	1	*	Must be a lot of war zones in China and India I didn't know about
t1_durxpjf	0	*	So how would you protest?
t1_dut4aou	1	*	GODDAMN MONGOLIANS KEEP KNOCKING DOWN MY SHITTY WALL!!!!
t1_dunr6o0	0	*	> fewer and fewer people take the left seriously.  Using an aljazeera article up voted by reddit and/or bots shouldn't be used to cast judgement on the left.  Look at all the top comments and this is a left leaning sub.
t1_duw75u0	1	*	It's -16xb0C here in Poland, I'm gonna fuckin freeze to death soon
t1_dusnu8k	1	*	Where I live, they're driving high performance cars, and they're running red lights, not indicating and mounting curbs. They're more dangerous than a new driver. 
t1_dudnnms	1	*	But...they really seem to be. Explain.
t1_duin9sn	1	*	Biggest reason my sister and brother-in-law moved back to the states. She couldn't get work and so was losing her visa, and he couldn't make enough to support both of them on his own. Queue moving to the US and they both land jobs right away.
t1_dupeopb	1	*	TRUE DAT! And he said he wanted to incentize them for carrying a gun. Dude, incentivize them for doing their job. 
t1_dueav79	0	*	Extradition to the us by a nation friendly to the United States to face criminal trial
t1_duj29oi	0	*	The main problem with this is there will still be sickos who want their children circumcised but since it's now illegal they'll have to do some dodgy back alley surgery which won't be anywhere near as clean as an actual hospital.
t1_duliv58	1	*	Isn't it funny how everything the liberal media is against, the russian bots are conveniently against as well. It's almost like the liberal media are just using russian bots as a propaganda tool.   It's funny how the media doesn't report on the foreign bots that are PRO-gun control.   On reddit, 99% of the foreign bots are PRO-gun control. Maybe thehill operatives want to investigate that. Oh no, they won't because they agree with it.   
t1_dufm6s6	1	*	I've always been sympathetic to the Irish, but their tax stealing is legitimately appalling. 
t1_dub9m7i	0	*	So I suppose the fact that the US is [spending billions to sway world opinion](http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/02/05/pentagon-spending-billions-pr-sway-world-opinion/) (even the quite nationalistic Fox News admitted it), including in my country, means my country is now at war with the US too? Or am I just supposed to hate Russia?
t1_duqvwcf	1	*	But it's on the front page in a negative light. It seems like the outrage is here.
t1_dudadei	1	*	Look at her picture -  pretty smug for doing something that,  frankly,  is not all that dissimilar to what normal people do all the time without having to call the paper to brag about. 
t1_duunyyl	1	*	Yes this is kind of taken out of context given the polar vortex just split so this warm air just surged up there without time to cool down 
t1_dui9wg4	1	*	claims to hate virtue signaling  but immediately spends a paragraph signaling the virtues of billionaires
t1_duq6sg1	0	*	They were basically a reasonable club for shooting enthusiasts until the 70s. There was a big power struggle for leadership. The new leadership put them on the path to become a political pressure / propaganda organization. 
t1_dujd2xr	0	*	You could forgive Americans for the fact that Trump is actually reality in the US and not a comedy skit. It might make it hard for Americans to distinguish comedy from reality.
t1_dude3g7	1	*	Haha, still blaming the Russians over Trump winning! Will this nonsense ever cease?
t1_duwkp5z	0	*	So well that everyone can be a Zimbabwe millionaire! 
t1_duy835y	1	*	It's not actual prostitution they fear, but women with the gall to speak out.
t1_duph8gz	0	*	your argument really isn't that when Germany has a strong military they automatically turn into Nazis, is it? 
t1_durkwpb	1	*	right? how about the Japanese should have thought twice about invading a country that was trying to stop Germany from taking over Europe. will they pay the expenses of the Chinese family members they slaughtered to come to their country to speak about how the Japanese killed them?
t1_duyhfz2	1	*	The sad part is that a lot of women are resorting to prostitution these days as the economic outlook is quite difficult.
t1_dubuyfm	1	*	Yeah but it was funny I just got done listening to a podcast talking about how McCarthyism is happening all over again. 
t1_dutnaj2	1	*	I ducking love reddit 
t1_dur2poz	0	*	What did you do when America had Reagan elected?
t1_dupyw66	1	*	BS, they are trying to sow the seeds of chaos in the USA.  When the balls drops, everyone will be tying kill each other and the government will have its hands tied for a while.  This needs to happen so they can free to wage war against NATO sans the USA...
t1_ducga0s	1	*	Putin wants to divide America, and if things got pushed to the brink of revolution he wants everyone to have guns so they kill each other I suppose... Makes sense to me that he'd be pro-gun from his perspective. Trump causes major division within the US.
t1_duxzd7j	1	*	Honestly if it were going to happen it wouldve by now. Theyre great marketers for pretty ordinary music. Isolate something your country frowns upon - do that in order to make a scene/get arrested. Achieve recognition. Release music. Repeat. 
t1_dutlmou	1	*	Ask how many of these experts down voting if theyve ever actually read the vaccine insert handed out by their Dr.  If they did theyd be very surprised by what they will find. Its amazing how much faster they jump to conclusions then the anti Vaxxers they despise. 
t1_due8psk	0	*	You're right. We should never do what IMF says because they're international bankers. 
t1_duft140	1	*	Not high, you would need to be from the future to know which part of the plane will be damaged the least so you can hide there. Also a team of time travelling doctors with nano technology who will perform an emergency surgery is requiered which will still leave you in critical condition. A lot of luck is involved.
t1_duy30ut	0	*	>Why would I tell hil what to do?  Instead, I will tell these 3rd-world countries what to do. It's the most american thing I can do
t1_duivbao	0	*	If I was a citizen of a retrograde power in objective decline I might be insecure too.
t1_dulfl6h	0	*	People are fucking strange about tiny amounts of money. A buddy of mine is really weird about tiny sums of money. He spent close to 4K on one of those wooden fort/swing sets for his kid but refused to shell out the 300 bucks for the installation.   So he gave a neighborhood kid 100 bucks and he and the kid worked for three days assembling it. 
t1_duqwfhs	0	*	> The bad news it will be $16,000 per day by the time it's approved and licensed in the US.  Nah. Medicines with recurrent profits are usually a lot cheaper. This is why your Tylenol is affordable, because Tylenol will be used many times by a person.
t1_dusivce	1	*	> the family name will be associated with Nixon  We're *way* beyond Nixon. Trump is the lowest bar at this point.
t1_duiiyvy	1	*	The UK is still vastly white British at 86%. So calm down with your backwards racist sentiment
t1_duodpoy	1	*	What the fuck are you talking about? How does this have 33 upvotes? It doesn't even make sense.  >if everyone around me is the same as I am, I will be more likely to trust them  What does that have to do with crime? Are you implying that if we all trusted each other more, there would be no crime?
t1_duk8ie1	1	*	I think he's either just saying something to say something and look like he's doing his job or they're trying to confuse everyone into submission.
t1_duylicj	0	*	I personally think this is far worse than comfort women, but since the victims were mostly Chinese, the western world don't care
t1_dusz1n8	1	*	Even Trump isn't that stupid.
t1_duvo7ga	1	*	It's not that complex/large a facility, just a series of refrigerated underground chambers. Besides, this is just an upgrade. The construction costs were quite a bit higher.
t1_duq2uu3	1	*	Let's require news organizations to identify all of their sources. That's sure to make it so people are willing to come forward with information about the wealthy and powerful.
t1_duj8n2b	1	*	Yeah, the article headline seems to be the actual propaganda. Surprising how good propaganda works, eh?
t1_duy61oi	0	*	Lol. You're just a tool as well
t1_dudd64k	1	*	I think if there was a list of things that gets passed around ok social media that lists things you can do to lower pollution like getting a reusable bag or bringing your own plastic bags, shorter showers...and so on, you'd have more adoption. As your giving something that everybody can do as they can pick from the list. I'd never expect anybody to suddenly drop eating meat from their diet, it would be crazy. But giving options to make a tiny change I feel like would have a better adoption rate
t1_dul853z	1	*	it is objectively a favour. 
t1_duw3w0q	1	*	Once we run out of water or food. In two weeks (or less) anarchy will take over.

t1_dujeb31	1	*	Yes, pretty comfy one, right next to the big skulls and bone  throne.
t1_dusxlfw	0	*	>A lot of people (regardless of their political positions) were disappointed by him today on the Chinese social media.  Ignorant fool here asking: are there a large amount of political positions held by Chinese people? I tend to associate China as a single, monolithic political stage so it's hard to imagine dissent of any form.
t1_dukeou8	1	*	Correct.   It seems they are doing it to to specifically offset Donald's anti-environment policies.  (Mostly just to bring attention to them, I assume)
t1_dui8vpu	1	*	So you're opposed to deceasing taxes and increasing spending? You must love the current Congress then.
t1_dugq0wi	0	*	i know, people voted for him because he tells it like it is and doesnt use political speech and isnt pc      deal with the consequences you fucks
t1_dumeyml	1	*	Because propaganda is being used against us to sway our next election ....
t1_duhsny3	1	*	Yeah except Big Pharma owns congress.

t1_dudf8o5	1	*	A LA VERGAAAAA
t1_duxj41u	1	*	> US then ran a campaign to get them out of power and backed a fundamentalist regime  First of all, how dare you. Russia interfered with us and we would never do that abroad. /s
t1_duukvzn	1	*	Money got involved
t1_dudxkyb	1	*	Anybody ever heard of robbing the weak!?
t1_dultc31	1	*	Greed, Money and Power does this to many people. 
t1_duhoeen	1	*	Same as saying there was lung cancer before smoking; so smoking can't cause lung cancer. 
t1_dujsu3g	0	*	Greek nationalist detected. I picked this from his comments to expose his bigotry and racism:  Nice... Greece forced to build refugee centers for barbarians with more borrowed money from the country who lent it so much easy cash that it bankrupted the entire nation in the first pace.  Apperantly he wrote this in a less regulated subreddit.
t1_dud36be	1	*	Yeah, it really seemed they were being 'anti establishment / anti Hillary' which obviously turns into 'pro Trump' later on by default.  There is so much more than this going on though.  Are people really dumb enough to think this is the whole iceberg? This is BARELY the tip. 
t1_duandsc	1	*	His wife probably wasn't in the room, so he wasn't allowed to talk to her. She would've moved his balls out of the house from their current place in a jar under the bathroom cabinet.
t1_duxq6b9	0	*	Trump also refuses to direct the NSA to prevent the Russians from hacking our election systems.
t1_dupbg7a	1	*	Nope, three days trading stories at the local church and 30 minutes at a gun range, then given an AR15 with no gun safe, just put it in your desk drawer. What could go wrong?
t1_dusj4mv	1	*	You can vote him out in 2020, but before than, be sure to vote Democrat in this November's  midterm elections. We have a good chance at taking the house, and with that, effectively countering Trump's agenda.
t1_dutr7l4	1	*	> I'd be willing to bet that rates of autism haven't changed a bit either  Can confirm. I am still autistic.

t1_duz378a	1	*	It's funny because either way he's boned. If he tells the truth, oh shit. If he lies, oh shit. The only I see him succeeding is to not be interviewed. Which then the SCOTUS could rule that he has to testify, which in response, he will claim some sort of made up privilege as to why he can't, thus triggering a constitutional crisis. 
t1_durvh0o	0	*	What a shame we don't all have the fucking privilege.
t1_duqbtdu	1	*	Vatican city is dominated by Catholic Christians.  Mecca is dominated by Muslims.  Jerusalem is dominated by none and would have visitors from Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, enemies of one another that will probably cause riots 10 times a day. Who needs this BS?
t1_dum26cy	1	*	Internet says: outlook doubtfull
t1_dukyunq	0	*	All that matters is that it is enough for fox news to spin it in russia's favor, and for trump cultists to buy it.  Replace fox news with RT and trump with putin for double (and probably the primary) effect.
t1_duwewvg	1	*	Same in Finland... As a kid it was expected for snow to arrive by November and it would remain until April.  Its been many years since we had substantial snow during Christmas and nowadays the cold doesnt really arrive until late January-February. Winters have been gradually getting shorter and getting pushed forward.
t1_dujlirs	0	*	Your last paragraph is literally nonsensical.
t1_durranm	1	*	Nawh you should go with vaccines to help with immunity.  Notice how no Anti-Vaxxers are getting away with corruption charges?
t1_duga6h3	1	*	The problem isn't that they aren't taking refugees, it's that they tell everyone else they have to. Fuck Israel.
t1_durjp6c	1	*	The northeast of NK borders Russia however, and they are definitely proactive. 
t1_dujjd7f	1	*	Congress would have to have enough votes. Which currently means that Republicans would have to demonstrate that they actually care about the country, so itll never, ever happen.

t1_duqfz8y	1	*	Generally speaking, the Democrats don't get as much money from large corprations compared to the GOP.  But I agree with you.  We need to get money out of our campaigns!!
t1_dupdbcb	0	*	Why is mass killers a useful metric? Shouldn't it be civilians shot by other civilians, more or less regardless of circumstances?
t1_duk72aq	1	*	Considering what they did, telling the truth wouldn't play out much better
t1_dulg1yb	0	*	Not... really? It says those deemed dangerous.
t1_dux51f3	1	*	The article was wrong. They meant Israel aims to eliminate Palestinians by 2030! /s
t1_dul3we2	1	*	More than that. If it wasn't for Trump, people wouldn't have been compelled to do this **with their own money**, instead of trying to take everyone else's money and offering that up.
t1_duscd86	0	*	Youre completely out of touch with the ground situation in Syria. The US is not going to anything, their chance is long gone.   My perspective: a Syrian who has followed this conflict closely for the past 6 years. 
t1_dutkunp	1	*	Let's mandate death sentences for people that don't see a certain political view as well.   That's how all this shit starts. You should think of the implications of your comments because it can create a *huge problem for everyone else!*
t1_dudxd50	1	*	Shit, voting for a third party, that's *definitely* scary stuff.

t1_duiixg1	1	*	I think that you have mistaken China with a country that has no Air or Naval defense networks, and please don't drag us Australian's into all of this, it's bad enough that our Govt. is unbelievably corrupt and is trying to convince our population that China is our enemy upon America's request.

t1_duyd1a8	1	*	Hi, hello.   >Now that the 2018 Winter Olympics are over, we're now learning who was responsible for hacking the games' systems... and the culprit won't surprise you at all. US intelligence officials speaking anonymously to the Washington Post claimed that spies at Russia's GRU agency had compromised up to 300 Olympics-related PCs as of early February, hacked South Korean routers in January and launched new malware on February 9th, the day the Olympics began. 
t1_dujo4z3	1	*	Doesn't stop other liars from lying about you though...

t1_duhulrm	1	*	Your first link is from five years ago, second link two years ago. Third link says:  > Theres no mistaking it now. Even though we dont have the final numbers, it is abundantly clear that the sea ice ringing the Antarctic continent has fallen precipitously  reaching **a record low** just a few short years after it reached a record high.  Meanwhile, Russia and China are opening up a year-round shipping lane in the Northeast Passage in [the Arctic](http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/).

t1_dutjg3g	1	*	Can't do that, I'm pro choice
t1_duw2qdn	1	*	I'm pretty sure I will. 
t1_duiz0gi	0	*	It's actually that almost all Russian men are homosexual, without laws making it illegal, and the mass execution of openly gay persons, the entire population of Russia would collapse into a giant gay orgy.   I assume. I mean in Canada we have so few gays that it's pretty inconsequential to let them go do gay stuff. So why would anyone care.

t1_duosnpz	1	*	> It's amazing how a joint operation started because the Russian ambassador tipped the Argentine security forces   I wouldn't be surprised if the Russians wanted to nail this guy already or get him out of the way, and decided to cook up this cocaine trafficking scheme. 
t1_dui8irg	1	*	Its capitalism, the best won.
t1_duyl0zx	0	*	It means they know he is an unreliable witness and don't want his rambling habitual dishonesty to get him in trouble. He could go in innocent and come out guilty. They'll bend over backwards to keep him silent, like everybody else around him does all the time.
t1_dutn0ku	1	*	For two main reasons 1) Vaccines aren't 100% effective 2) There are quite a few people who have health issues (allergies and disorders) that mean they CAN'T get the vaccine.   Having your kids vaccinated means that people who haven't been full protected by the vaccine or can't get the vaccine are less likely to be affected by your kids.

t1_ducsk9u	0	*	Reading something with the knowledge that it was a foreign power attempting to manipulate you is a lot different from reading it and thinking its your fellow Americans expressing sincerely held beliefs.  I think its vital that people see exactly the techniques that were being used to manipulate them.
t1_duzejwy	1	*	Maybe the Welsh smelt a way to get out a little bit more from under English heels

t1_duqkwhd	1	*	> A social policy that encourages population growth and the traditional family.   > Opposition to immigration and the humane repatriation of recent immigrants to Italy.  Those two things alone are enough to send a lot of the left off on a baseball bat attack.  
t1_dujwjaa	0	*	Besides the fact he has created 2.4 million jobs and minority un-employment rates are the lowest in US recorded history. I guess he is more of a twitter troll than a national disgrace.

t1_duwpfmo	1	*	Counter Radicalization is a complex issue. You have to be careful, taking these kids away from their families could cause just as much radicalization in their community as bringing the help they need to them, within their family.

t1_dus0ket	1	*	Gotta prevent the Russians from building their pipeline from Iran -> Ukraine and keep the worlds leading oil + NG importer (the EU) from giving their money to the commies. Better to give it to the decapitators (SA)
t1_dulhxww	0	*	LOLwut. Nobody said Trump was personally responsible for all the election shenanigans. You're either trolling, demented, or seriously misinformed.  We know Putin was (and still is) directing a lot of this trolling and hacking to interfere with democracy. Trump is just a useful idiot. I cannot believe Republicans are OK with this state of affairs.
t1_dupt7l0	1	*	I'm not frustrated. I'm okay with paying the SoLi and the highest amount of taxes. I'll wait until it's decided what's going to happen with the money. 44 billion are more than two times the amount needed for free transportation. That would be nice. Or since the groko wants to stop the cooperation ban and if they spend it on schools then, that would be great. 
t1_dutx1ge	1	*	There is literally no link at all between autism and vaccines. None. 
t1_duju458	1	*	Lol
t1_dua9d2e	1	*	An STD metaphor huh. Guess not much else to expect from a guy eschewing condoms.
t1_duqo2z1	1	*	The best reason I could see for him to hold out is that the person he has to give up is Trump or someone close enough to Trump (Ivanka/Kushner/etc.) as is the same thing. If that is the case then it would potentially make sense to hold out and hope for a pardon getting off scot free for his loyalty over pleading down to potentially years. 
t1_duaq2n1	1	*	Not that this is the opinion of japan (only an ex ambassador). But this thread is taking the title literally and doesnt see any inconsistency with one of the most isolated and xenophobic developed countries shaming us for leaving the EU.  Can you imagine how japan would react to not being able to control immigration from its continental neighbours? 
t1_dutky57	0	*	That's fucking crazy how the buildings next door are intact, lights working and everything
t1_ducmt48	0	*	Its an old fashioned Cold War style proxy war. You don't need to worry about it unless you happen to live in one of the proxy war regions. People in the US and Russia are safe. Everyone in the military and intelligence organizations on both sides knows the rules of the game. Its a game thats been played since the 1950's.  You fight the proxy, never the power behind the proxy.

t1_duft80p	1	*	How about banning burkha? Or giving holidays for religious festivals since the state is supposed to be secular? Or dragging kids to religious places?
t1_dug7w25	0	*	The heart has its reasons of which reason knows nothing of - Blaise Pascal.  A lot of propaganda is emotive, it triggers fear and hate, its hard to counter this by using reason and facts. It's shown time and time again, people ignore facts that go against their feelings. That's probably part of the difference between Liberal and Conservative, Liberals tend to like facts whereas Conservatives tend to trust how they feel about things. There's a miscommunication between the two.
t1_dusi4cf	1	*	No, don't ignore it, condemn it, condemn it loudly.  We live in a media bubble over hear and rarely hear what leaders of other countries have to say. 
t1_duaay9c	1	*	Very smart guy, made the right choice.

That said no one in Syria wants to live under AQ or ISIS anymore. 
t1_duf21k7	1	*	I always knew K-pop would bring world peace.
t1_duq8jw2	1	*	For me its less Trumps collusion as much at this point specifically, and more Russia messing with the elections at all. I dont care if he KNEW they were trying to get him elected, i want everyone that was involved to be jailed though.
t1_dut1ofi	1	*	I am surprised no one has said this yet.
t1_dut9ito	1	*	> Don't worry reddit still loves you. Anyone want to talk about how China is leading the world while Trump is Hitler?

t1_duhv89h	1	*	It affects anyone who has, or wants to be able to afford insurance. Insurance companies pay, but where do they get their money from? So when people see their health insurance premiums skyrocket, this is one of the main causes.
t1_duf1e9x	1	*	 I saw this brief documentary on the war in the Ukraine and the Ukraine soldiers captured a Russian POW, who was claiming that they were initially told this was all an exercise and more and more became real. If anyone knows what I'm references please link it 
t1_duzbimv	0	*	*Citation still needed 2 years later*  I never thought Conspiracy theories could be this widespread. You'd think after every bombshell ended up being a nothing sandwich people would stop with the M-MUH RUSSIA. But hey, a new Republican presidency so there's a new democrat-led conspiracy theory that'll probably end up being nothing.

t1_dug1iaj	1	*	The example of the pilot who crashed the plane in the Alps, following that there was a protocol change across the industry that there must always be two crew members in the cockpit at all times. That could mean your flight attendant.
t1_dua4f9c	1	*	Guns can't possibly be a ssfety net against a government, not now. Is a government, with an arsenal of drones, tanks and all manner of weaponry we probably don't even.know about, supposed to be at all bothered about a few people with guns?  The second amendment no longer has any purpose when it comes to protecting freedom. Guns, however, are quite profitable...
t1_duo91yo	1	*	Well it certainly wasn't this Iranian's Gender Studies Major that made him do it.
t1_dupjilm	0	*	If you learn to speak German, you can go to University in Germany tuition free. No need to be a citizen, just speak German fluently. I know that's easier said than done, but think about it for your kids. Star them small, they'll get it and have options when they are older.

t1_dusxh3p	0	*	Inner Mongolia or Mongolia?
t1_duh74a2	1	*	Are they Russian trolls or are they just not participating in a circle jerk? I honestly cant tell how significant any of this is, because on one hand it looks really bad on the other hand its bad news for Donald Trump so Reddit comments arent exactly the least biased way to get a discussion about it.

t1_duc8yal	1	*	It's not a documentary. It's a drama, that isn't based on any particular real story.  It's also an Israeli movie, that was partially funded by the Israeli government, and won the Israeli academy award for best picture. The minister of culture is a Trump-wannabe that hates it, but that's kinda like Trump hating any media left of Fox News.
t1_dubw1b0	1	*	It's only being reported because this is the first time this strain of Avian flu has been detected in humans. While it's unlikely to ever become pandemic like levels or on the same scale as seen in films like Contagion, it's still something that should be noted and monitored.

t1_duia2fq	1	*	Bill Gates is the only thing stopping that.    He thinks that he knows how to spend his money more effectively than the government. I think he is right. The issue is that he wants the government to choose how to spend other peoples money. Just not his.

t1_duiasyk	1	*	I absolutely agree. It just seems completely devoid of empathy to  bother athletes who just finished a bad performance.

That's where I saw the strangest things. Like in one village in Cambodia, people's houses were all on stilts (because of flooding I guess) and under everyone's house there was basically a garbage dump. They would just toss shit out the windows and have their house hovering over a giant pile of garbage. It's messed up.

This is like if Democrats got their news from The View. There is no right wing talking point too dumb for Trump to believe and then fucking REPEAT.   He has the solutions to all the world's problems that the experts just haven't considered: build a wall, ban the muslims, deport the illegals, bomb ISIS, etc.

t1_dunxfjt	0	*	nonsense? wtf do you mean?   The the electoral commission chair says in the last 3.5 years ~ 250 people were not allowed to run at different levels because of criminal convictions, he is one of those people.  The only thing special about Navalny is that he is a loudmouthed cunt. Most people don't give a fuck about him, so no unrest. unrest only exists in the western media and reddit.

t1_dud9v93	1	*	> No, if these charges are true, they just wanted everyone at everyone elses' throats. Which we already were, and are.  The incredibly irony of all of this is that it's the Left which is playing right into what Russia intended. I bet they couldn't be happier with Anti-fa et al.

t1_dukx710	0	*	That's like four countries, all of which just happen to be on top of enormous oil or nat gas reserves. And they can't even get it out themselves - they have to pay foreigners to figure out how to extract it and then to actually get it and sell it.  The idea that these countries have had any actual role in generating their wealth is laughable.

t1_duddc09	1	*	I get it, but we can all blame the dead equally. This process started with industrialization in the 1700s. Human greed doesn't know generation gaps, and the young are not immune.  That said, I get it. I didn't have kids, in part due to this. It's a raw deal for everyone but we're all born into it.
t1_duoyabr	0	*	Yeah fuck people that are trying to escape poverty am I right?  Some people I swear...

And btw, I'm still going to vote for Putin myself, but show me more videos like this and I might change my mind.

t1_duqof6w	1	*	Before you get the choir in an uproar, the conspiracy has nothing to do with the original narrative of the president 'colluding' with Russia.  There has been nothing close to substantiating those claims. 
t1_duje69z	1	*	Canadian here. You haven't been assigned your gay person to marry yet?

t1_dugrb7h	0	*	Mueller is 4 steps ahead of almost everything we know and he has been keeping it leak free while letting the indictments and guilty pleas speak for themselves. And now bringing those indictments against the 13 Russians pretty much forces the GOP to allow him to finish his investigation, they can't keep saying it did not happen and is fake news.
t1_dui9dgo	1	*	Because the hundred thousand they pay in one year is like you buying a Sprite at the gas station.  Everyone should feel the same level of burden from taxes.  Real dollar amount is meaningless, percentage of income or wealth is a much better metric to determine fair tax payments.

t1_duiwkd1	1	*	Came here to say just this.   In Germany there are only a few Bachelor programs in English so far, but you can study most topics at the Masters level in English.   The notable exceptions are teacher training and Med school because they aren't traditional degree programs. You have to pass two state exams to become a teacher and three state exams to practice medicine.

t1_due1xhw	1	*	Its not a shithole though just so everyones clear.  
t1_duf5kyy	1	*	If the majority of spending happened after the election, that means they either took the money knowing the source, or did not take the issue seriously enough to implement proper vetting of who is paying them.  Either way, that suggests a few people need to be fired for gross negligence.
t1_dunvl76	1	*	Remember; food banks are capitalist bread lines
t1_dugqhhd	1	*	That actually did happen, interestingly enough. Some guy who worked for them was leaving twitter did that on his way out, but it got put back.  Honestly, Twitter's getting more people on their site than ever, more activity, so on so on. There's no way they'd try and stop something so great for them. Even if they did, pretty sure that would cause a lot of long lasting problems for them and just make them the good guys short term.

t1_duglww3	1	*	Literally none of what you said is true.  Conspiracy to defraud the US is a crime, as is wire fraud, bank fraud, and aggravated identity theft.  No one issued charges for speaking bad about Hillary, or holding a rally.  Why lie?  What angle are you trying to push?

t1_dus122z	0	*	To counter cynicism with cynicism: news about atrocities in Syria is the only subject on reddit that immediately elicites cries of 'imperialist propaganda!'. Coincidentally, I'm sure, this is a narrative that serves Russian interests very well.

It's just plain wrong regardless of what you use, somone else buying somthing is their own choice.  30 years ago in most states somone selling weed wouldve been killed for a couple O's with a Philipines style systen, dispite having simply sold a near harmless plant.

t1_duyh5bm	1	*	If there is a only northern Ireland follows EU regulations to gain a soft border. Couldn't that make northern Ireland the go between the UK and EU?  It would bring alot of investment to Northern Ireland, while still maintaining an independent GB that can make their own trade deals with countries outside the EU.  Although I feel like the EU will not accept this though as they would have a lot to lose. Things like fdi opportunity and effectiveness of tariffs on the UK.

t1_duad25f	0	*	Remember that reddit primarily consists of 16-25 yr old American manchildren so that skews opinion towards whatever these retards think. Also the upvote system results in circlejerking. NEVER take reddit opinion as a proxy for general opinion. Remember all that Bernie sanders circlejerking? XD

My answer will be the same no matter if it is a bot or someone that supports gun control.   The flaws are there because people have been supporting saftey over their rights for far too long. Now they reap what has been sown.    If the country burns down all I can say is I saw it coming.

t1_dupykob	0	*	I've heard it's more of a cultural thing, like you're considered a bad/weak person if you don't win. Cheating to win somehow doesn't make you weak, it means you want to win more than the other people, and if you win while cheating it shows you have more conviction or something.  My source for this is an Uzbek friend who hates Russia with a passion, though, so grain of salt.

I'm not saying she is either, i disagree with how she said it, but a pretty week and victim like response on their end.

People will expect the US to pay out the largest sum to feed, house, rehabilitate the North Koreans into modern society. And if the U.S doesn't China or Russia will step in to make sure they are the main influence in the area and the rest of the world definitely doesn't want that.

t1_duco67s	0	*	the social media giants are just as much to blame for letting this happen as the foreign enemies who perpetrated it. We're still not hearing anything concrete from them about how they're going to put a stop to it.

t1_dut787a	1	*	Im not sure how government works in china so im just wondering does this mean there will be no future elections? Canada doesn't have any set terms for our parties but we still have a federal election every 4 years. So a party/leader can stay in  as long as they have the support of the people.
t1_dupdomr	1	*	With just a bunch of Tim Horton trash sticking out everywhere.
t1_dugcezr	1	*	Because Reddit is mainly visited by Americans.  Only natural that they care more about what happens in the US than what's going on in Israel.  I wouldn't even comment if Sudan was doing that kinda stuff. Not sure why so many people are surprised that we care more about certain countries than others.

t1_dujkovh	1	*	do you think you could cherry pick enough cherries to feed the homeless with those cherry picking skills? or do you prefer making cranberry vodka? how is it possible that everytime there is a discussion about trump someone finds a way to cherry pick what he said. its like somehow he cant talk for himself and needs internet strangers to translate for the few who believe his bs. what a weird game you are playing.

t1_duuf8qz	0	*	I find it hilarious how the same reasons stated here (aggressive, expansionist hypocritical) for the hatred of modern China is the exact same descriptions you would give the European colonial powers in their hey-day. If you knew anything about the opium wars you would know they tread on China, and ushered in the century of Humiliation which shaped Chinese outlook on the West and how to conduct its affairs well into the 21st century.

t1_duie3j3	0	*	Yes but those Gospels say that anyone who denies Jesus as the Son is the anti-christ which is what Islam does.  That's the rub, there is plenty in the Gospels for any Christian to dislike Muslims.  There is plenty in the Quran for Muslims to dislike Christians-heck the Quran tells Muslims not to take Christians or Jews as friends.  Religion is not going to solve the divide.  Religion is actually the basis of the divide.

t1_dua616z	1	*	if a tree falls in the woods and there is no one there to hear it does it make a noise?  If there is self defense with a gun and the media does not cover it did it actually occur? Depending on which of the stats that the US .gov has collected there are between 50k to 1.5 million times a year when people use guns in self defense. Granted the range of number makes me question the accuracy but it obviously DOES occur.
t1_dussov2	1	*	Yet here you are
t1_duj7l7p	1	*	Do they? I don't think North Korea would nuke Seoul, unless an invasion force was coming from there. North Korea is more likely to lobe a fee at Japan, and Guam. Also, radiation is an issue with Seoul, because it is so close, and would render it uninhabitable. North Korea would probably use their chemical weapons stockpile on the south, but no more than that.
t1_duvhxo1	1	*	It's not like there are free elections anyway so does it really matter?
t1_duxrmlf	0	*	Not even remotely a total ban on guns. Norway has one of the highest gun ownership rates in the world, and from what I have heard they are mostly fine with the idea that they can do without semi automatics.   The crime rate is very low - gun ownership is based more on a tradition of hunting than on fear.

In Scotland at least, we studied world religion most of the time, and if you continued to study Religion after your early years of high school, you spent most of that time learning Islam and Buddhism iirc. The main purpose of RMPS was to give an understanding of all the different religions, and to teach tolerance. RMPS was the only class where our teacher encouraged us to question our beliefs.
t1_dujk6ig	1	*	Of course he couldn't know if Russia interfered, so a flat out denial wouldn't make sense. Even then, he still called it a made-up story, and a hoax. He has said that he believed Putins denial.   He contradicts himself so often that there are always other statements that match his new version of the truth, but here he was clearly wrong, and, as usual, refuses to admit it. You can debate if that constitutes a pants-on-fire lie, but it is definitely dishonest.

If a company can mine all that metal it will also have a monopoly over it and they will never sell under the price other than to cut all the current conventional suppliers off.

I'm not saying Wising is wrong, but that's not the whole story.    Also, a book review on HuffPost is not even slightly a legit source.  I'm pretty sure the author, Doug Wissing, should have some sort of better citation that isn't this HuffPost Oped.  
t1_durid3m	1	*	He doesn't. He talks about funding what most other nations consider basic social programs instead of loading $1.7tn on the debt and having it go to the rich.  America is socialist for the wealthy. We take as much as we can and hand it to the people who already have the most, no matter what it costs us.

Our system is flawed and because of the flaws it is difficult to exact needed change as called for by a large number of citizens. We didn't all make him our president and part of the good part of our system is that we are, in theory, afforded the right to speak out against what our government is promoting.

Big licensing fee, renewed yearly; strict storage and use provisions, etc. Bump stocks and any other device that makes a semi-auto work as fast as a machine gun are to be just as restricted, that is what The Donald told the AG. Rifles are hunting weapons first and foremost in a peaceful America. But you can't ban them because one or two types are used in crimes like mass shootings.
t1_duwq0io	1	*	Nurses definitely have the more manual job but don't think that the doctors are in the back wasting time. There are endless notes and orders to write that you most likely have to finish at home or stay late. At least a nurse gets to clock out.

t1_dudvsaq	0	*	That is the thing with decisions, one has to be made otherwise you get stuck in limbo. There was referendum in 1975 to Remain in the EEC and as you can see that decision was not final. And sorry but it isn't democratic to have another one right after, you are just deluding yourself.  So in another 40 years or so just like the 1975 ref you might be able to decide again.

t1_duab7cq	1	*	Lol.
t1_dunbt36	1	*	After a massacre, the President of the United States has to be reminded to listen to the survivors. There's having to be coached and shepherded through the Presidency because you've no idea what you're doing, and then there's having to be told to act in a human, sympathetic and authentic way after a tragedy. I can understand the former, but the latter - as this is - just deepens the notion that Trump is just not a great human being at all.

t1_dulfkyl	1	*	Yeah, i actually really enjoyed studying religion in the UK despite being an atheist.  The history of it all is fascinating and some of the stories are really fun, i really enjoyed Hinduism.

t1_duxgpro	1	*	I'm good with that, too. I think you'd be hard pressed to find anyone who doesn't consider fentanyl to be anything other than a toxic substance that is incredibly lethal. I'd like the public consciousness to consider it to be in the same category as krokodiil.
t1_dujqmqm	1	*	Ascribing it to mental illness is too kind.  I think what you're seeing is simply the natural end result of a lifetime of coddling, entitlement, self-aggrandizing, narcissism, and delusion.  Now combined with the mental stress of outside forces threatening to tear that all apart.  It's an outright attack on everything that makes Trump, well, Trump, and this is just how he responds.

I'm guessing this must happen in a way that the patients insurance covers it but im sure insurance companies eating costs like this means a rise in insurance costs for everyone.

An Indo-Pacific NATO like pact would be enough on the part of US, utilizing it's already existing military resources in the region. India is better suited and is already taking care of the business opportunities among the -stans and M.E. countries. As long as China is held back from spreading more of it's influence in ASEAN/Africa, Japan/Aus can easily fill in the gap.

t1_duq8xzu	1	*	Diplomatic status is conferred by the host country. 
t1_duc1iai	1	*	And Iran is also and ally of Syria.  The US is illegally in Syria and will have to leave.  The Turks will probably see to that.  The US has no right to be in Syria.  It is an invasion on the sovereignty of Syria.  Technically this could spark a war between Syria (and her allies) against the US as an invading force.  Does the US want another intractable war in the ME?  US should leave Syria immediately.
t1_duvkcft	1	*	Kuta/Seminyak are covered in rubbish, but places like Uluwatu are pristine. Partly because bogans wont pay to go to the beach, and partly because less rubbish being produced means the ways they get rid of it work when theres a small amount. 
t1_dupwe97	1	*	Teachers and familiy complain nonstop about how lazy and unmotivated we students are so I guess thats a yes
t1_duj3qdo	1	*	Tbh it's either or prolapse or the *gift* your pick man.
t1_ducs9tc	1	*	Corporations try to rephrase it as jobs or infrastructure investment being threatened by regulation, so they don't look so greedy. But to me they're just holding their workers hostage in a really petty way
t1_duuinf7	1	*	Im glad we could all come to an agreement on this.
t1_duyff25	0	*	Ehhh not really, depends on the sample size and other factors like voter honesty. Clinton didn't spend much time at all in Wisconsin because she assumed she would get it, whereas trump visited multiple times. 
t1_duhfnr7	1	*	Not a problem.  After Brexit, when the xa3 is worthless, we won't be able to afford US imports. We will all live on healthy fresh roadkill.
t1_duc71g8	1	*	If you study geopolitics, youll find that on the net, western foreign policy has created more dictatorships than democracies.
t1_dujaizr	1	*	From posts here and google, his opposition is more visibly anti-homosexual and xenophobic so I can't say there's much hope if you're expecting change.

t1_due9x22	0	*	Perhaps every pizza shop should charge the same for pizzas.
t1_dukebxx	1	*	I know nothing about curling, but I heard this answered on TV. Rule changes several years ago forced all curlers to use the same type of brush, where in the past you could have an advantage with a better brush. That increased the importance of physical fitness in winning a match. 
t1_dug0im5	1	*	> take note of how many commercials air for prescription drugs  This still amazes me.  AFAIK we're one of (if not the) only countries that allow direct pharmaceutical advertising.  No, I will **not** ask my doctor if your drug is 'right for me;' he's a medical professional and I am not, so I will tell him what is wrong with me and seek his professional recommendations.
t1_duqn1vs	1	*	Yup.
t1_dufe691	1	*	He needs a different space niche Elon musk can't do. Space tourism isn't easy or even in demand all that much. Much better to focus on space races, like red bull and extreme sports but in space. Pod racing in space will be the biggest thing.

t1_dut2smh	1	*	Not exactly, he could have been waiting to reveal a successor, some theorized he was grooming someone to be his puppet while he continues ruling as an elder statesman.  Being this blatant about being a dictator is a bold move. 
t1_duujjua	1	*	Europe also gets the highest quality coffee.   Used to hang with some guys who did import/export of beans worldwide.   Europe gets top tier, US/Canada 2nd tier, rest of the world 3rd tier.
t1_duueeqy	1	*	Seems so.

t1_duds2hh	1	*	Yeah, you didn't read it.  These bot accounts tweet once per 3-4 minutes.  That's how we can pick out the more suspicious ones; by volume.
t1_dufnxyt	1	*	US media is disgusting...  The amount of people who think trump was referring to Nazis and white nationalist when he said fine people on both sides is outrageously high due to our shitty media repeatedly omitting the fact he followed that statement up with and I'm not talking about Nazis and white nationalist they should totally be condemned..   All US media sucks and is far more divisive than russia
t1_dut3hxa	1	*	a lot of people saw it coming, the proposal is more of a symbol since he was able to run pretty much anything after consolidating the power. If you need any condolences, 1+ billion of us will go down with you. GET THE FUCK OUT OF Here, while you still can. 
t1_dus8567	0	*	Are you kidding? That's all you hear in these threads. People are so disrespectful about this tragedy; all anyone says is what about this what about that...  It is not a competition there can be atrocities on both sides of a war, and Japan's massive war crimes does not negate that this was a tragedy. We should strive to never turn to nuclear warfare again and defending it is frightening.
t1_duk5axf	1	*	How leftist *is* the media?

t1_dugc5re	1	*	A/K/A too much blood in his alcohol stream.
t1_duyp6p8	1	*	Charging trump will be the last step.  Plenty more to come.  And here I thought Americans loved the reality tv-like suspense.  A reality tv hack is president after all. :p 
t1_dui9fps	1	*	The policy makers are owned by the wealthy. If they act against the interest of their campaign donors, they don't get to be policymakers anymore. The entire system is rigged in favor of the ultra-wealthy. Gates should be smart enough to be above this level of nativity, putting the blame on policy makers instead of the people at the top who actually run the entire system.

t1_dutb5ga	1	*	There have been a lot of sanctions passed against Russia.
t1_dugcs54	1	*	Is this funded by US taxpayers?
t1_dud3xuj	1	*	To be clear, Rosenstein purposefully intended to convey that these allegations are not meant to inform anyone as to whether Trump or his people are implicated or not. If they are, that would be a separate set of indictments at a later stage. If they are not, we'll find out when they formally announce an end to their investigation.

t1_duuaj10	0	*	Thanks, this is exactly what I love to see! The Prefectura isn't taking any shit and considering some of these Chinese fisherman actually try to ram vessels their weapon use is totally justified.  Offtopic: totally agree with you on DDL and There will be blood. It's certainly one of my favourite films; cinematography, music, acting (Paul Dano, too) - everything is just top notch.
t1_dusy068	1	*	That was Russian backed rebels, not the Russians themselves. I wouldnt 100% trust whatever these US officials are saying if its about Russia. Likely biased. 
t1_duz7bsh	1	*	Lol it's funny because you are from Turkey.
t1_duhfcmt	1	*	I cant envision any reason to be doping in curling, however you can easily get a medical clearance for having such drugs in your system if they are prescribed to you, so there is also no reason not to be medically cleared for this. 
t1_dugyf8d	1	*	Yes it is vital we do so.
t1_duz48su	1	*	True. My city currently bans 0/1 conpliant cars and motorcycles and 2 diesels. I often drive a vintage car and bike... The police simply doesn't care. They know that's a stupid ordinance in a city where many people can only rely on their old beaters to move given how inefficient our public transportation system is. 
t1_duscgv6	0	*	Beside the mind-bogglingly stupendous amount of energy that would take, as well as the fact that the distance between the earth and sun already varies by about 3 million miles over the course of a year? Nah. 
t1_ducrzfo	0	*	Whether or not people would try to use the information for propaganda and distraction purposes, doesn't change the fact that Russia definitely did meddle in the US election. Any other country and we'd be talking about sanctions and embargoes by now. But because it's Russia, and they're associated with Trump, half the country's default reaction is to assume (or hope) that its all lies.
t1_duaosoe	1	*	Because we got Trump, we should be fucking with them 365/7. they un-fuck us we'll stop.  
t1_dunhhuw	0	*	Europe is much more authoritarian than the US is.
t1_duaqm0c	0	*	>I agree this statement. I am not sure that I would describe Trump in a more flattering manner though.  Uh, it's not even a comparison. The fact that people still think Hillary is a sadistic sociopath really means the propaganda worked.  Is she an amazing American politician ever? Not really.. But to classify her as being almost as bad as Trump is just laughable.. and proof that too many people believe the things they hear and don't actually look into stuff. 
t1_duvaosg	1	*	That would be a law every president ever has broken. 
t1_duj8yr3	1	*	Well, I'm also Russian, and I've seen it, and at least some people I know. The video being viral doesn't mean everyone *instantly* sees it. And you can count this article as one of viral channels.  UPD: And this reddit discussion.   ,   ,   ,    -: -,    -    .
t1_duxkyqw	0	*	It's been going on in Eastern Europe for decades. The Western world is only now getting a taste.

You probably just don't want to put a ton of sugar in it. I have mine with just half-and-half.
t1_duxynb5	0	*	wtf is with that writing:  > Pussy Riot have said that two of its members have been found and are safe now after they were alleged to have disappeared in Crimea. > > Earlier today (February 27), the Russian punk protest group took to social media to claim that two members  Olya Borisova and Sasha Sofeev  had gone missing on Monday (February 26).
t1_duui742	1	*	also copy pasting headlines from drudge...
t1_duoo048	1	*	America shot down an airliner too so we're even steven . EDIT Well, that's what that cocksucker Trump said.
t1_dut2rlk	1	*	Sometimes yes, but this literally has nothing to do with Trump. They have been having talks since the 80s. 
t1_duz5vpy	1	*	They're both Islamists but they are different factions - same as the Saudi religious authorities, they're virtually identical to ISIS with the same Islamist laws, but they are different factions and hate each other because Saudi Arabia works with America.
t1_dubjp4m	1	*	> weed in general is frowned upon in most Caribbean islands.  But they sure do sell a ton of booze to tourists.    Luckily booze doesn't have any negative correlations.

t1_dug337n	0	*	How did you fail geography this badly?
t1_duiyj1m	1	*	Yes! But just a whole generation of wasted young men (and probably women too) throughout many African Arab nations is the undercurrent of this article. What else they gonna do? 
t1_duafsr9	1	*	That's the hilarious irony of this. The gammon headed racists who pushed Brexit through are going to be in for a shock when they see who ends up doing all the unskilled seasonal work in the UK when it's not Eastern Europeans.
t1_dulbgtq	0	*	It was a really interesting subject that taught about morality and about world religions as well as (I believe if you kept it on) Irish history. Quite a lot of people I know enjoyed it and kept it on.
t1_duloxrp	0	*	It's kind of interesting how much of a double-edged blade the internet is. There's so much information one can access, and it's fast and at your finger tips. Back in the day, if you needed medical advice or knowledge, you had to go see your doctor. Sure, it wasn't convenient, it took longer but at least you're getting it straight from a train professional.  Now, everyone spends 3 minutes on Google and thinks they're an expert on whatever it was they spent 3 minutes Googling. 
t1_duneaai	1	*	tbf to do big buisness in russia you gotta hang with the big guys in russia so it could mean there could actually eb possible more links to russia.

t1_dueidhj	1	*	It means they have been indicted -- An indictment doesn't mean they have been found guilty, it means they have been charged with a crime and will stand trial if ever apprehended.
t1_duepl15	1	*	Largely because everyone in Russia who can doesn't live or spend their money there.

t1_duguac7	1	*	Depends how many likes and retweets they get.
t1_dunh6gy	1	*	America will of course be dragged kicking and screaming with this trend. You should hear the local suburban moms (who drive $55,000 monstrosities of SUVs) clutch their pearls when anyone even *suggests* local ordinances requiring a per-plastic bag fee. I know people who flat out boycott Aldi because they charge $.10 for one plastic bag.
t1_dul78zd	1	*	I'd say it's as popular as ever really, with series like the Crown boosting an interest in the monarchy and lots of coverage of Prince William and Kate etc.
t1_duwd10x	1	*	It freaks me out. The thought that the only habitable planet we know of might become an inhospitable chunk of rock is scary and depressing. And you feel powerless. The usual answer is always change your consume habits, i am frugal, there is not much i could change. It feels pretty depressing.
t1_duq7cfv	1	*	Yeah, if you think actually fighting against fascism is ok, you're not my ally. If it takes more than a retweet we shouldn't do it because it will just make the fascists stronger somehow. -A very smart person

t1_duuranc	1	*	Well, jokes aside, as powerful as Chinese navy is, it still wouldn't pull off an operation that far away from its coast. Since the Americas is pretty much in US' sphere of influence, US will get involved.

t1_dui8xx0	1	*	But it's these billionaires who are (in)directly lining the pockets of said politicians.

t1_duypzzq	1	*	Unfortunately both the GOP and DNC along with their super PACs receive tons of money from foreign sources. Look at how many super PACs for the DNC receive funding from Soros. I'm sure both sides receive a lot of money from Israeli lobbyists too. The number of people in the house and Senate with dual citizenships is pretty crazy. 13 Dems in the Senate and tons of Republicans and Democrats in the house.

t1_dudt1s4	1	*	People have pain and can't get real medical help, it's not affordable or even attainable, by design. This is how the opioid crisis is being progressed; the drug companies make more off the illicit trade of drugs over the 'legitimate'. Follow the money. 
t1_dumf50p	1	*	Yeah, it was just a discussion class about anything really.
t1_duhzm3k	1	*	Those sort of tactics inevitably corrupt the role of police and politicians which makes the promise worse.
t1_dubtz2t	0	*	Based on narrative convenience. The problem probably exists, but this is approaching McCarthyism.   It's an easy way of silencing people you disagree with by giving them a label that they can't argue.
t1_duqoi9h	1	*	You misspelled *win 
t1_dup7xtc	1	*	you must not have been paying attention. Its a mental health problem when white people do it. He is just an unstable lone wolf.

t1_duc21xf	0	*	>greatest  They're singlehandedly responsible for setting off the chain of events in Europe that led to tribes and cultures banding together and competing for ressources and lebensraum to survive against the empire.  Literally everything that went wrong can be traced back to the spark of rome thinking they need to expand aggresively and bring their culture to the barbarians. 
t1_dusn4ng	1	*	but even if we could, theres no way we were going to pay for it. imagine that this situation was going on in canada. even having the money, the president would be like what? this stupid idea is yours. no matter how much money i got, its none sense. wanna build it? your problem, your money.

t1_duji4f8	1	*	Its not like he doesnt win his elections. You think he doesnt get all those votes? Russia has their popular powerful strongman in power thats what they want.
t1_duycqzp	0	*	True. However, Israel has way too much influence over US politics and more light needs to be shed on this. [AIPAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Israel_Public_Affairs_Committee) has over 100,000 members and lobbies on behalf of right-wing Israeli interests. And that barely scratches the surface. Too many people see Israel as an extension of the United States and this is a problem. Our national interests don't always align.  Edit: changed 2 words to clarify

t1_dueuwyf	1	*	It's a containment sub. For the most part they stick to their little safe space and jerk each other off rather than bother the rest of us. Delete it and all those bots, trolls, and brainwashed idiots will have to spread their opinions elsewhere. Also, freedom of speech.

Even if all these mounds were residential buildings and even if they were all built at the same time and not by successive civilizations, they were not nearly the size of modern Manhattan buildings. 
t1_dups6t5	0	*	I don't think anyone is saying other athletes don't dope, it's that Russia's doping issue is state-backed and systemic across the board. That is the criticism here.

t1_dut3n3o	0	*	I bet 25 pesos that Trump (at the very least) will suggest the idea of lifting the term limit before he's forced out. He and his 19 supporters will be all riled up by the idea, but he'll really just be saying it in a moment of improvised senility when a hard work comes up on the prompter.

t1_duyr4y9	0	*	At least Obama did *nothing*, unlike Trump who seems determined to start open warfare with just about everyone, from Kim Jong Un to Bashar al Assad to Recep Tayyip Erdoan, and that's just in the Middle East. He's also picking fights in China and South America as well.

t1_dui9wyk	1	*	And yet they are taxed at a much lower rate than most of the population, through loop holes, capital gains etc. The whole article was basically about adding more tax brackets and raising the taxable burden (percentage wise) on the billionares, who see the most kickback through taxes being paid.
t1_duae23a	1	*	I imagine he just procured a bunch of underage hookers and cocaine for them to share over a few bottles of wine. 
t1_duycchf	0	*	You have no clue what you are talking about.  Most of packaging paper today comes from sustainable forests. You don't cut Amazonian forest to make paper lol.  The big difference is that you can plant trees but oil (needed for plastics) is a limited ressource.  Additionally the recycling of paper is close to 100% while closer to 20% for plastics.

t1_dumpsx7	1	*	Im sorry your comments and logic are just wrong. Yes people do salvage some things but a vast majority of the trash problem is wrappers and bottles which people will not salvage. Even if they did salvage some things this would help most of the problem with trash in rivers and streets. 
t1_duz38q8	1	*	Most certainly. She has already admitted she's lied for him in the past.  http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/02/hope-hicks-trust-me-i-only-tell-white-lies-for-trump.html
t1_dus3siz	1	*	Howard did a great thing by introducing the NFA, but he's still no saint. Nonetheless, take an upvote for Barnaby shooting loads into staffers
t1_duwxszd	0	*	The real question right here. What a bogus, misleading headline. 99% of doctors are for the raise. 
t1_duq7zpl	1	*	Push the Central European Bank to adopt monetary policies that benefit Germany and the north of Europe alone by ripping of the south. Also, they dismantled the industry in southern Europe as a requirement for joining the European Union making Spain, Italy, and Greece the playground for retired Germans to live the golden retirement.
t1_duvebdi	1	*	Trump had him in the White House last year, maybe theyre good buddies.

t1_dulcq6g	1	*	Americans with a head on their shoulders and spines care. 
t1_duqys29	0	*	Then what's the point of the briefing if they could just look it up on wikipedia or something?  You're saying that any briefing about the sanctions would probably include a discussion about classified intelligence about north korea you say?  What a great point.  How astute of you to bring that up.
t1_dui7dep	0	*	I think while you're right, I think it's important to consider the geopolitical ramifications of such a technology uniting such a culturally diverse place like India.
t1_dugguv6	1	*	Probably something along the lines of getting water from a dry well, like you cant get bread from a hardware store? At least thats what I gather.
t1_dunyl7r	1	*	It's mildly amusing given the number of times Trump has been telling foreign governments what he thinks is wrong with their countries. Amongst European nations alone Britain, Belgium, Sweden, Germany and France have all been offered unsolicited Trump advice, so I'm sure he can handle having a little bit coming back Denmark
t1_duu9d1g	1	*	We dead.
t1_dunscq4	1	*	Be prepared to see lots of dead blue helmets then. Unless this was a /s moment.
t1_dupkt6j	1	*	Pretty much the other way around. If they just spend as little as France with the second most expensive health care system, they could afford 1.5 more militarys.

t1_durrjpn	0	*	The area they are bombing is literally controlled by al-qaeda in Syria and a few other Islamist factions. If the West werent so against the Syrian Government, wed normally be bombing these guys too 
t1_dup77qx	1	*	Privyet, tovarisch.
t1_dui9mgn	1	*	Why can't it happen though?  If republicans can use reconciliation to pass reform, then why can't democrats?
t1_duqtdhr	0	*	The bigger question is why the FBI didn't warn the Trump campaign about Manafort's problems. And that is relevant because they did warn the McCain campaign when he ran, so it isn't against the rules or anything like that. That fact stinks and adds credibility to the theory the FBI was biased to get Clinton elected.
t1_dudh266	1	*	Hahahahahaaha. Haha.  Ha.  You think Trumpster fires learn from their mistakes.

t1_dukucr6	0	*	I often think about how no one is going to show up at my funeral.  This sounds like a great solution.  
t1_duqeu8u	1	*	They also paid money to get Bernie elected, everyone keeps insinuating that the Russians bought off Trump when all the evidence shows they were trying to keep Hillary from winning, Bernie was their first choice, then it was Trump simply because their only objective was to keep Hillary out of office. 
t1_duq65d7	1	*	I doubt it. This is their entire operation getting exposed, shut down and having to start over including majorly, the ~~traitors~~ assets they've cultivated over the years etc.
t1_dugf9lu	1	*	How is he a hypocrite?
t1_dui27na	0	*	The effective top rate is no where near that though.  A relatively recent example was Warren Buffet announcing he paid 17.4% in 2010.  Is that right when, as he states, his office workers are paying about 36%?  Right now the tax system is not actually progressive and the brackets are an illusion.  The only people paying these rates are upper middle class professionals with high salaries.  Ultrawealthy capitalists don't pay it because capital gains are not taxed progressively.

t1_duuefl8	1	*	I wonder if there will be another Deng Xiaoping to rescue the communist party once the rot truly sets in.  I am not saying that Deng was an angel nor am I suggesting that the party isn't already corrupt.  Then again, Deng allowed the communist party to lumber onward rather than transitioning it to system of government by the people, for the people.  Hell, it wasn't by the proletariat, for the proletariat in Mao's time, rather it was by Mao, for Mao.

t1_dunxm5f	1	*	I guess that's why Canada, an immigrant-happy nation, has such a low crime rate despite 30.8% of households owning at least one firearm. It's called having sensible laws and regulations!
t1_dubeq64	1	*	Uh no, hes supposed to be a Leader. A World Leader. Cant just say somebody handed it to him and he signed it not his fault. There's 2 possibilities, he either read it and said yeah this is fine mentally ill people need more guns or he didn't read it and just signed it like an idiot.

t1_duhitsj	1	*	Don't worry man, governments are set up in such a way that they have many different departments and can therefore focus on more than one problem at a time. 
t1_duuhb5w	0	*	The best kind of ruler is a benevolent dictator. The problem is though, that benevolence doesn't inspire the right kind of people in order to remain in power.   So slowly they start becoming less and less benevolent and they just turn into the cookie-cutter dictator we have seen rising and falling for centuries. 
t1_dujzgh5	1	*	I dont believe they interfered. That became a laughing point, not a talking point, a laughing point. Any time I do something, they say oh, Russia interfered.  https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2018/02/there-is-no-longer-reasonable-doubt-about-russian-interference/553640/
t1_duhfbek	0	*	Family is the biggest factor.  Children of single parents are 7x more likely to be sexually abused, they make up 70% of cases.  Women struggling with kids feel like they're in a dream when they meet a guy they think is great.  Like this Navy SEAL.  That makes it easy for prolific predators to date woman after woman.

t1_dupk1m7	1	*	*In theory*, the Office of the Inspector General for DoD is supposed to operate with complete independence and would perform the audit.  However, since the OIG in this case was non-responsive to the study's author and then later (allegedly) disabled web links to prior data, I'm not sure I would hold my breath on this one.     Most other portions of the executive branch are audited regularly by their respective Inspectors General and those audit reports are made public.  
t1_duzaf09	1	*	Well China still have A LOT of poor places.  Like places with the shittiest buildings you'll never find in America.  Some people of China still can't get working electricity or good plumbing system and there are LOTS of poverties there.  The Chinese have to eliminate those before the boom slows down.

That's why the members of [ZW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_Military_Union) executed people who were in the Jewish Ghetto Police etc.  You seem to think that only Jews had a right to feel fear and the Poles had an obligation to be heroes, at all costs.

This is the dream he tries to realise, because he thinks conventional dictatorships are way too uncool. In his mind, he is a great deceiver and manipulator - not some stupid tyrant. That's why he needs elections and some free press like Echo of Moscow or TV Rain

t1_dujmnxu	0	*	It doesn't exonerate anybody but it doesn't even touch the issue of collusion either. I'm not saying don't prosecute this stuff, but how much effort is being spent on these tangents rather than addressing addressing the central issue of allegations of collusion? Surely they could address their main charge first, then follow up on this stuff given there's no credible connection between this and the 2016 election. Otherwise it just looks like collecting scalps to justify the probe's budget.
t1_duejkc3	1	*	Trumps going to come out and say, we did it first, its only fair Russia be allowed to meddle. Just like that USA does bad stuff too thing 
t1_ducrafa	1	*	See, it's the divine space between the twat and the shitter. It's the twitter or better yet the twitter-sphere. It's the lady equivalent of the knorse or knorsonian knot or barsehole better known as the barseholian prism . Thus, shrines must be erected and laws must swear to serve its royal pungency.

t1_dudukh2	1	*	They'll flog it to someone for a few hundred, or maybe a few thousand $. They probably don't know the true value and just wanted some quick cash, so they'll sell it for a fraction of the value to get rid of it quickly.  Either that or it was stolen to order. In which case, it's probably half way around the world already as it's probably quite recognisable to the aficionados in Europe.

t1_duf37ly	0	*	I think the thing that other countries are overlooking in this issue is that there are no large land-based predators in Australia. Without occasional hunts, the kangaroos simply overpopulate,  strip the vegetation from the land,  and die off in large numbers of starvation. Do you think that is less suffering for them than a strictly managed and regulated hunting quota? There's inevitably a cull one way or another. I think the kangaroo hunt is actually the most humane option.

t1_duoqeam	1	*	It feels like the US is held back because of the worry of lawsuits.  Everything has to be double and triple checked and tested over and over *and over* for a decade or more just to make darn sure someone *doesn't sue you* if/when something goes wrong.    
t1_duppvsr	1	*	yeah this is mostly bs. It highly depends on the industry. In reality I don't know a single person doing 35h or less, that's basically the absolute minimum
t1_duo46zm	1	*	The internet, globalization have left many people feeling they have lost their identity. People feel that their cultures and way of life are being threatened. Our behavior is changing rapidly because of technology. The only way to preserve culture is to go authoritarian. And I completely understand it

t1_duwn1es	0	*	Actually Portugal did it first. Also, Norway was the first Scandinavian country to propose this. Besides, it is my firm belief that a majority of EU countries (Sweden, Germany, France, and Italy ect) will not adopt decriminlization as those laws will be needed to control the criminal gangs.

t1_durye9n	1	*	Wait, we all know the answer? What is the answer?  Australian Gun Laws were extremely effective at reducing **gun** homicide rate. But it had no impact on the homicide rate. In fact, the homicide rate increased, years later, to figures above what it was just prior to the 1996 law going into effect.  Unless you're talking about mass shootings, only? I agree, there might be a case for Australia's gun laws affecting mass shootings in the US, if implemented. 
t1_duhwaqo	1	*	It's not like testing is magically great. Doping still pays off, if you do it smartly, and I'm pretty sure that it always will the monetary benefits of doping will always be greater than the monetary gains for catching dopers.  That said, taking Meldonium is incredibly stupid. And if this is reasons to question the participation of all Russian athletes, that's even more stupid.
t1_duqihz4	1	*	Chavez gained power in 1998 and socialists have ruled since then. The PSUV was just a consolidation of existing socialist parties into one banner which occurred in 2007. That doesn't mean socialists weren't in power before 2007.

t1_dui2sgg	0	*	I agree. We should start there before increasing the tax on the rich. America has wasted trillions on neverending wars in the Middle East and Afghanistan. All those trillions could have built and fixed incredible amounts of things in the US, which could by secondary effect have also stimulated economic growth and wellbeing. Taxing the rich alone will be a cosmetic fix to our flawed government spending.

If you're walking with a drink with a large open top you can either stop every time you want to sip or you can just count the time until you end up slopping your drink on yourself.  Small-top cups work fine on the go though, like sports drink bottles.

t1_dui8zbx	1	*	Sadly, this is the question people refuse to ask. People want billionaires to pay more in taxes because they despise them. If you want fair tax policies, then argue that the middle and lower classes should be taxed less, not the rich taxed more. 
t1_dus05r5	1	*	That's the relevant question. Most of the post are just awefully cynical. As if the situation in Syria/Eastern Ghouta will become unreal real when you complain about media lying.  Just because you don't have an answer for this situation doesn't make it less bad.

t1_dunmlst	1	*	Oh shut up. Be glad they're doing something.
t1_dum6put	1	*	Not if he wants to keep pretending he allows elections. It's like the Ukraine situation. Putin wants to size territory but wants to also pretend it isn't his soldiers.   Fact is, putin is too scared of the west to admit what he's doing so he plays pretend like the coward he is.

It wasn't.  Edit: I can't put together a cohesive sentence.

But holy crap that first year was suicidally hellish  Over on /r/collapse they all say that the five steps of grief can also be applied to learning about climate catastrophe.  You'll get to acceptance in time, and to be honest you'll probably be a better person than when you first found out. Your priorities will shift and you'll learn to embrace what you have today.

t1_dusvjw5	1	*	I agree with you, but I think it's important to make a distinction between individuals and countries as a whole.   While Japan as a nation was an aggressor, we shouldn't forget that the victims of the nuclear attacks were individuals, many of whom had no personal involvement in the atrocities committed by Japanese soldiers.  We can still empathise with the victims of Hiroshima & Nagasaki, even if we mostly condemn Japan's actions during WW2.

t1_duwylg4	1	*	The specialists are those getting privileged by the current ultra-corrupt government. Generalist doctors are starting to have tough times, just as the nurses get cut from their jobs. Many get tempted to go work in the U.S. where they're being treated basically like demi-gods.  Like Chomsky once said, destabilizing and impoverishing public services is the long yet safest way to privatize them. And the shitlords like thre current Health Minister are profiting from it in the process.

t1_dua6jmu	1	*	Guns vs guns! They have one, you have one. Thus you are safe. Also we can't forget, it's a constitutional right! The Constitution was written when you had to manually load each round and could fire a maximum of 3 RPM vs. x RPM today. 
t1_duotafq	1	*	Street value would be the value on the street.  Kind of self explanatory.  Not the wholesale prices.  Also not sure why your calculations need to keep changing between imperial and metric.

t1_dud81o3	1	*	Money, if I know you read the news every morning then watch random fetish porn at night I know what you're interested in and advertise it to you. It's pretty staight forward too, things like the Like this on Facebook buttons are doing it. Many websites also use Google Analytics which does the same thing.
t1_dugwg3p	1	*	I skydive from time to time, and I would much rather be on a small Cessna 182 crammed with 3 friend and a pilot than a commercial plane. I'm not usually a claustrophobic person, but something about being on a commercial plane gets me anxious about every little thing. 
t1_dur0gml	0	*	 Norway has the largest sovereign wealth fund in the world. Over a Trillion dollars. They shell out 13mm to fix a seed vault that they lobbied to have and that promptly flooded? They need to invest way more

t1_duygrh9	0	*	Do you realize how dumb you are? Sexual pulsions are natural, violence is natural and innate, using your logic I can go away with anything. And while you are at it go eat tapeworms, catch lice, mite and all because that is natural too. 
t1_duq04ir	1	*	They want the US to kill itself. They're trying to light a powder keg and have been surprisingly / terrifyingly successful.

t1_dumpis6	1	*	It's exactly why Trump is a bad president. I'd rather have a smart, self interested president that I strongly disagree with and dislike (let's say GHWB, either Clinton) than a dumb, naive, kind hearted person (no politicians come to mind) who I agree with and like. Trump is delusional, idiotic, selfish, and also I disagree with most of his policies. He's so dumb his advisors, that he appointed, publicly quarrel with him and debate him. Weak, bad for America.

t1_ducch69	1	*	Trump would have them drilling oil wells.
t1_dud0cq0	1	*	So far there is only evidence that Russians changed people's *opinions*, which is not different from any other form of propaganda - including shilling in social networks that both parties do. In the end, however, it was American votes who put Trump in power, so by all means the election result is legitimate.

t1_dunc55g	1	*	Wasn't it in the indictment that no Americans knowingly colluded with them, and that their efforts had no effect on the outcome of the election?
t1_duid3j5	1	*	Nothing. The study doesn't say the ice melted quickly 1500 years ago, the study just only goes back 1500 years.
t1_duis6el	0	*	Well, that one time payment may not seem like much, but it has quite a large impact.   It helps alleviate personal debts, the locals would inject it back into the economy, it's a nice bonus that keeps everyone happy.   You could spend it on a project, sure. But this is buying happiness, and possibly votes. It can also distract from other issues, such as Singapores plan to increase the goods and services tax by 2%.
t1_dupe2d2	1	*	But was it war poetry? That's the _dangerous_ kind. 
t1_duwb1s1	0	*	I'd everyone in Europe did that it wouldn't make a dint. Africa's population is going to pass 4 billion by 2050. Eating locally is not going to do anything. I'm not going to disconvenient myself so I can pretend I'm helping the environment. We made our bed now we have to lie in it. Once Africa reaches European conditions, then give me a ring.

t1_duy94me	1	*	Porque no los dos?
t1_dupakyb	1	*	What's sad is that documentaries have been around proving this for over a decade and people thought it was all fake news to defend their habits. I know people that are convinced that humans die without meat consumption. It's really just a matter of government brainwashing and the FDA claiming lies are reality even though no independent oversight's required for ANY corporations in the U.S. It's literally the law.

t1_dust1tz	1	*	It doesn't matter what anyone says. Trump will simply deny it. Making Trump eat his words is a bigger challenge. 
t1_duvjdk4	1	*	That actually looks pretty badass. Imagine a team of snipers dressed with these. 
t1_dueypgm	1	*	Because we did not raise rates on income taxes or inheritance to offset the cuts. If this tax plan cut the corporate tax but increased the taxable income of over 5 million or so to 60% and the estate tax to 90% for sums over 10 million everyone would laud it.  But as it stands it's just cutting revenue during a time of growth.  It's short sighted and straight up stupid. 
t1_dumwqp5	1	*	Trump asked Russia to help him win the election - they did.  That is wrong.  The end.

t1_duygem0	1	*	I think we have confirmation of the multiverse. Cause Trump fans surely live in another universe. Reality and facts mean nothing to them. They just refuse to accept it and create their own reality.
t1_duh9v3g	1	*	They are everything they say the left is. Trump Derangement Syndrome lol. Were so deranged because we dont enjoy watching our country be led by a buffoon. Meanwhile they cant even acknowledge anything has gone wrong with this administration or that there are any suspicious ties to Russia. Pathetically delusional, and... *deranged.*

t1_dur5rvu	0	*	Venezuela had around 60% inflation under Chavez too, along with intermittant basic good shortages.    By the time he died Carcas had the highest murder rate in the world.   Shit ain't something that only started to happen with Maduro, it's just the snowballing legacy of his dead mentor, who, like his protege, also enjoyed wiping his ass with the Constitution, even if he actually had populist support back when he was doing it.

t1_duw77zq	1	*	Positions of power disproportionately attract horrible people. Those people don't stop being horrible once they successfully attain those positions.  Or, to put it another way, good people are too busy being good people in order to do the unsavory shit they'd need to do to have the power to be truly effective.

t1_durt1zq	0	*	Apple doesn't sell your data to other companies for advertising at least. That makes them better (if you care about that).  And Chinese law simply doesn't allow Apple to do business in China without doing what the Chinese government requires. Sure, it's easy for you to complain but that's just how it is. There's a limit to how much they can protect Chinese data from the Chinese government.

t1_duqe1gj	1	*	Well the argument posted in the article is that we still have the advantage of logistics in competition with Brazil, i.e. direct rail connections for transport. It's a complicated issue for sure.
t1_dunf25o	1	*	you can walk in the dark by yourself in lots of countries - east asian countries are generally very safe - china, japan, korea. 
t1_dupf5x8	1	*	Title of episode 6 of a future 10-part HBO minieries. 
t1_dua2zk3	1	*	I think it's more to do with the fact that these things usually need to develop/change over time before they are capable of infecting humans, once someone has been able to get infected others could too so more may follow over time, so it may seem pretty insignificant now to us but it's very important for the agencies to be watching this kind of thing.
t1_dutc5nq	1	*	It's a great tactic if they consider America to be sworn enemies or whatever. The enemy as a guest on your turf and you get to read into their character face to face. He'd be a bad supreme leader not to feel out the new leadership.

t1_ducq00p	1	*	Mom's spaghetti
t1_dujmdfm	1	*	here's his quote from the article:  this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story.   he was talking about the collusion claim, and at other times explicitly acknowledged that Russia is known to meddle in elections.  in fact, he got in trouble at the time for saying the USA does it as well.
t1_dunfh5t	0	*	Yes, I'm sure economic disparity and social flexibility have absolutely nothing to do with crime, It must be all about race.

t1_duouzr1	1	*	Theres no money in that. 
t1_duy3f85	1	*	Japan's overall expensiveness is somewhat overstated. It used to be more expensive relative to the rest of the world but a decade long period of economic stagnation while the rest of the world charged ahead saw the rest of the world catch up somewhat.

t1_dunwpyc	1	*	It is the same as before WW2, you had Mussolini, Stalin, Hitler, Franco countries were praising Mussolini when he got into power even churchill. We can't afford to have WW3 though so I don't know whats going to happen

t1_duo6q93	1	*	Lets call these Jhiadi groups what they are. Al-Qaeda, Taliban, ISIS, Syrian Moderates(lol), Afghanistan Northern Alliance, all just Sunni Salafist Wahhabist special operations forward fighting forces for Saudi Arabia.   Each and everyone has received billions in aid from the Saudi Royals. 
t1_duqkooy	1	*	Hmm I bet YOU don't like child sex, why don't you go enlist to guard people in South Sudan?
t1_dua9uwu	0	*	Hillary wanted Assange droned to death, so it wouldnt be a shock that he wasnt rooting for her to win.
t1_dubz4oh	0	*	The council housing system is broken too. I know families with household incomes of over xa350'000 a year, nearly double the national average, who are living in subsidised housing and also qualify for a massive discount when they decide they want to buy it because they have lived in council houses for years, despite the large income.  Its a joke.
t1_dur1ege	0	*	Hey! People of Venezuela, I will mail you food! PM me your address and I will mail you food disguised as clothes so the mailman wont take it! No joke, serious offer. Ive mailed food to redditors all over the globe, whats a few more folks? And I think u/heyarea would do the same.

This could be the cause of genetic deformities.  5) (Possible) Lax regulations = Higher amounts of contaminants in sorroundings = Higher rates of deformities. I havent seen any definite proof of this though. 
t1_dudws5t	1	*	Heavily influenced by the US market trends towards pricing of medicine I feel. If never even heard of this company before!
t1_duqfxyf	0	*	But it's not *real* socialism. If you tried my version of socialism Venezuela would be a utopia and the sole world power by now
t1_duep0h4	1	*	I'm told that the FSB don't even get to go to Vietnam these days unless officially approved.
t1_dumna8k	1	*	And maybe itll be in a fancy DC prep school with a couple congressional kids in it. Maybe they will pull their heads out of their asses if it actually affects them. 
t1_ducldzp	1	*	It was still a good business decision from a bottom line perspective. Amazon didn't turn a profit for over a decade. Korea obviously didn't expect to make all the money back during the Olympics. Many investments are long term.

t1_duoq03c	1	*	I'm totally feeling your comment, but we're going to be fucked out of some delicious, exotic, *Bolivian Marching powder* and you aren't really facilitating its return with your crass, thinly veiled threats.  *You'll catch more bees with honey than with vinegar*
t1_dusl0qy	0	*	Canadians can get pretty retarded over hockey. I remember reading that Vancouverites threw a guy off a bridge for wearing the wrong jersey. 
t1_duhjjpl	1	*	I guess he's trying to make the point that since it started before that he can't be involved?   Like his point is that a multi billion dollar nefarious state program to influence 400 million people couldn't possibly change direction or add in a plan like corrupting a candidate.  I'm not trying to say this statement is reasonable but I'm pretty sure this mouth breathing logic is what he's proposing. Which to be absolutely fair like 50 million rabid Americans will believe their dear leader.
t1_duaekih	1	*	The country that owns the biggest car factories in the UK. 
t1_dumlyxp	1	*	Start bashing capitalism ( rightfully so ) and everyone on this sub loses their mind.  There's an alternative people and it's not communism.  How about socialism with a resource based economy where we try to make sure that we use our resources as efficiently as possible without destroying nature in the process?

t1_duu6ymt	1	*	As an American I couldnt agree more. 
t1_dusitx8	1	*	Since the joint press conferences with foreign leaders seems to be the only ones trump is doing nowadays, that wouldve had all eyes on it.   That would've been quite the scene.

t1_dutx4y5	1	*	Literally impossible to tell as it's only been translated into English as a thing for less than 30 years (1991, didn't make it into diagnostic material til even later and was practically undiagnosed in girls/women for years afterward).

t1_duxgjg0	1	*	His job was selling US secrets to our enemies in an attempt recoup his insane debt. Hopefully this curtains that. It's kind of the point. 
t1_duxmt7u	0	*	You seem to know a lot about blockchain. It already has the capability, with potential adoption, to help small businesses avoid transaction fees. There are lots of ways blockchain can make life cheaper, faster, and more secure. No need to assume the worst. 
t1_dunz5qw	0	*	Not just that, but shock impingement at the wing root is going to be rediculous. You may as well melt the wings off now and save yourself horror when it happens in flight.
t1_dutyfl2	0	*	This. It seems that China just needs to twitch a fibre of their economic muscle and the Aussie pollies are back to being best mates with them.

t1_dusxm7p	1	*	star wars rocks
t1_dukkjv7	1	*	Well, not really. If Iran attacks Israel, there's no preemptive success, as in the six day war. The Iranian military arms are much better at coordinating and cooperating with various regimes, especially after Syria. Their air force and anti air capability is also comparatively higher than that of the UAR at the time. 
t1_duekz93	0	*	Whataboutism 
t1_dupo4vi	1	*	>Germany has been pushed to not spend on military due to its past. Now you want Germany to get back? Make up your minds.  NATO has been wanting the Germans to spend more on their military since the 50s. There really is no concern over them having a strong military anymore, and there hasn't been since the end of WWII.
t1_duvivly	0	*	Ill show you my empty silos if you show me yours
t1_dugt655	0	*	I feel like lying about things like this with the intent to sow public discord needs to be some sort of crime. It's not having an unpopular opinion, it deliberately trying to slander an entire group of people with the intent of creating social divisions. Even though they didn't bring any fake claims against any specific individuals, I feel like this should treated in a similar way. They claimed that a crime was committed when it clearly wasn't.
t1_dupene1	1	*	Well its a UK newspaper and UK newspapers like to separate the UK and Europe its always been like that with headlines, even the left wing ones like the Guardian do it

t1_dusmt1w	1	*	Telling someone to take back his lies desn't really count as a directive per-se, I'd chalk it under good advice.
t1_duygphr	1	*	This is how it is meant to work. There is meant to be a prolonged period of time before a person is to say it again because the point is the couple are meant to try to mend some of the issues between them..
t1_duc654u	1	*	No. The missile parts said MADE IN IRAN on them in english, and have the symbol for Iran's version of the FDA, the Iranian Standard Institute logo,...because apparently all missiles have to be certified safe to eat like a bag of chips?
t1_duz1mv5	1	*	...I dunno, getting Blackwater goons into instructor positions in your nation-state's military sounds like a great way to have a fuckton of war-crimes committed later on.

t1_duymvr3	1	*	One step closer to finding the pee pee tape! 
t1_dubrt2l	1	*	For sure. Sweden is a pretty big quality of life upgrade over Russia. It's not like they had to go to England or France.
t1_duli36b	1	*	Given that religion still has such a huge impact on the human race and relations on this planet, I'm disappointed it's no longer compulsory as it will lead to less knowledge and more ignorance.
t1_duyp2vh	1	*	Well, considering Obamas line in the sand debacle theres a point here. America looked like inept fools. The repercussions exist to this day.   
t1_dupr3rb	0	*	Pretty sure they are replacing the Tequila from a name brand bottle with the swill they have concocted so people don't know they are drinking methanol and 95% proof alcohol. No one in their right mind would willingly drink this. So the same would apply with tainted Jack Daniels I would imagine.  Edit: last sentence added
t1_duprgk1	1	*	>Well, to all of you who are saying Germany is just letting others foot the bill for their security: There was a time when Germany had a strong military. I am pretty sure you guys dont want that again... Germany has been pushed to not spend on military due to its past. Now you want Germany to get back? Make up your minds.

t1_dupiu4t	1	*	There are certain countries (I won't mention any names) that need to learn that national defense isn't about taking all of a country's money and giving it to billionaire defense contractors so tanks and planes can sit and rot in countries all over the world where they're not needed. Every country needs a military, but nobody needs one that exists mostly so rich people can get a lot richer.

t1_duvnz4e	1	*	I know a couple people who are considering opening up private recycling/waste management plants all around Indonesia but the problem is that there's no established/standardized way of transporting trash from point a to point b and the amount of red-tape and palms you have to grease to get things through that red-tape makes things hard.

t1_duygg1v	1	*	They are doing the same shit everywhere. From getting Duterte elected in the Philippines, to the Brexit and the Catalonian independence.  NATO have set up defenses against this, but each country must join it, and the US hasn't. For obvious reasons.

t1_duz897q	1	*	It should be noted that Trump's bodyguard, Keith Schiller, who claims the prostitutes were sent away has been collecting 15k per month through his consulting firm from the GOP since leaving the White House.  https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/21/trumps-ex-bodyguard-makes-15000-a-month-from-a-gop-slush-fund.html

I like to use the analogy of the student who says but how could I be failing when I got a B on this one homework assignment?    
t1_dupqffy	0	*	The republicans haven't moved right.  The Democratic party IS a socialist party at this point.  20 years ago we could at least agree that people here illegally shouldn't be here.  Like that Cuban kid deported from Florida back in the 90's.  Now you're a racist if you want to stop illegal immigration.

Of course, Soros falls into 13th place on both those lists. At least the poor and downtrodden teachers were able to scrape together 33.6 million last election cycle and end up in 9th place. Good job teachers!

t1_dud9svc	1	*	These are to....  1) show that russia interfered  2) establish mechanism of interference  3) Provide a case to attach US defendents to. If a US citizen knowingly helped them, they can be charged with conspiracy too. Also, if a campaign accepted assistance from them, then the campaign might have issues.  This is a foundational case to attach other things too.

t1_duoc7ib	1	*	We haven't had a real election for years.  In fact, I would even dare to say that his first and last real election was right after the infamous Moscow buldings bombings.(FSB was involved).  It's a very old trick. And then he actively used I'll-protect-you-from-terrorists rhetoric and thus won.  But it was never this bad  as it is now.

t1_dut4i1o	1	*	Putin be like damn you can do that, but dont make it so obvious
t1_dupay8f	1	*	I'm not sure if its still in effect but after 9/11 the Bush administration enacted provisions whereby regular police were given military training... in several, if not most, instances it resulted in increased violent actions when enforcing the law, increased vilification of innocent civilians, and a widening gap between the relationship of civilian and police officer thus creating a fear of the other instead of a sense of community and safety.
t1_dubmp8p	1	*	The fact of it is that the Trump administration needs to hold on to the support of any right sided citizen. He won't risk putting out any material that'll shift how they consider him and his policies. That's why they won't release a picture. And it doesn't take a ton if insight to figure that out. 
t1_duwehky	1	*	Yes. Thats the plan. When you increase demand for public transport people won't drive around in their own cars. That will reduce emmissions. Which will help the environment. How do you nt get this?
t1_duw42c1	0	*	ISIS also want to provide universal healthcare and socialist control of the economy, in addition to executing gays and apostates and enforcing burka/niqab.  Our western ideas of right and left don't translate 100% to islamists.  In fact even between western countries, ideas of right and left don't completely translate. Like in the US socialized healthcare is a fringe idea of liberals, but in Australia even the right wing government would not dare to scrap our socialized healthcare.

t1_duns81d	1	*	There is a US Air Force Base in The Kingdom of Denmark. Placed there after WW2. Does that fact make you think differently about the Russian invasion? De facto that makes any invasion of Denmark an invasion of The US by NATO alliance musketeer oath.
t1_duowa32	1	*	Embassies are not sovereign territory. Within the embassy the laws of the embassy's home country apply, but the embassy is located on land controlled by the host country. This is for a reason. If it was sovereign territory, the host country would be unable to remove the embassy, even if they are building a thermonuclear device. By owning the land, the host country still has the power to remove the embassy if need be.

You could argue about the significance of certain atrocities relative to the whole of history (although I do think the Armenian genocide is a bit too recent to put in the crusades/inquisition category just yet) and obv neither the modern-day country of Turkey nor the next generation of Turks are or should be responsible for this, but it is still a genocide.

But hey lets make it worse by complaining about a meeting being canceled after he insulted the NK. Why did he schedule the NK meeting if he's such a hard ass? Why complain when it's canceled if you go out of your way to not shake their hands? Why would he want to meet them if he won't even shake their hands?
t1_duo6j6d	1	*	My guess is that the financial crisis and the failure of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan revealed the failures of neoliberalism (and neoconservatism). The ruling classes then decided to use authoritarian nationalism to protect their economic position  against the threat of greater redistribution wealth.

t1_duszzb6	0	*	I think that your mentality is what's scarier. Leaders are put into power to get things done, it's not a hollywood popularity contest. The main concerns of the people should be the things that a leader does, not whether he speaks fluently or has a nice face.  You don't have to like your leader, you only have to like what he does. The people you wrote about obviously liked what Xi does, so their interests are aligned. Why is that scary?

t1_dumh0y4	1	*	Most of us are sucking his dick as he can never do wrong in their eyes. Some of us, who remember our fucking history with a dictatorship no less than a few decades ago, look on as our country burns in division while the president and his cronies sit rich and fat stop the corpses.
t1_duhfayz	1	*	Mate, legitimate criticisms of people who happen to be black aren't racist.  What's your brilliant alternative? Be so afraid that morons might you like cry racist, that you let people get away with anything if they happen to be black (which by the way is ACTUALLY racism)?
t1_dueqwx3	1	*	The experts are encouraging people to eat more kangaroo meat because their population is growing at really fast rates. From around 27 million in 2010 to 50 million in 2017.   https://www.google.com/amp/www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/kangaroos-australians-eat-more-population-50-million-meat-animal-a7941076.html%3Famp
t1_dua6pxw	1	*	sea rescue will fish you out of europeans costal waters after you sank your island.
t1_dufgwnl	1	*	Seriously. I don't know who is egging on the left these days but I find /politics to be just as repulsive as /thedonald. 
t1_duni0sc	0	*	Declaring all who disagree with you to be trolls or bots is not a good state of mind to be in. Your country is in a shit state with a lot of people genuinely believing these things. People not coming to terms with this fact are actively working against their interests. 
t1_duc5u7n	1	*	If they don't like what it's saying
t1_dubr96o	1	*	Maybe the Russian  bots (and others) are for sale to the RNA and gun manufacturers?    There is nothing illegal about lying on social media.  Not saying its right, but if you can attach $$$ to an action, you can guarantee its being done.
t1_dublu4v	0	*	No shit, eh?   60,000 rookies should be good for about 6,000,000 trees a day. After removing J-roots, seedlings tossed into duff and the ones planted in shit microsites, there should be about 7,850 trees that make it to free-grow.

t1_duet17a	1	*	From abuse, uh, yes. Many.
t1_duwxcgb	1	*	I always was impressed by Botswana when I was there. If they want to be racist and get rid of the whites, why don't more Southern/Central African nations follow their lead (Not that Botswana gets rid of whites, but that it's on a decent trajectory)?  Why doesn't Botswana push their model to their neighbours?

t1_dujqh3n	1	*	They don't care to learn from history. A smart person notices when someone repeatedly denies doing or saying things in the face of records and they take any new statement by that person with a grain of salt.  But you know... We're gonna MAGA and make Mexico pay for the wall and Hillary and Obama are ruining America despite being out of the public light for fifteen months.
t1_duq0ava	1	*	Also our government wants us to believe the anti propaganda they feed us. I dont believe half the bad stuff we hear about other countries like China. There is always two sides. Some info we get is true but in the case of China I see them making more strides when it comes to things like the environment than we will. Sure, they did it out of necessity but they will leave us in their dust someday soon if we dont clean up our act and step up.

t1_dug11zl	0	*	How you define partisanship vs. just having an opinion?  I believe the government should stop cutting the social safety net, stop making it hard to get abortion, stop scapegoating immigrants, etc.  Am I being partisan?
t1_dupgaoq	1	*	Welfare is a waste of money imo and military R&D investments helped make huge advancements in science.
t1_dufzjd2	1	*	Exactly.  He is being punished when he is the victim of of the Muslim government of Iran.

t1_durr9lo	0	*	Stop procreating would be the best option.  Still will be useless 
t1_duz85g6	1	*	I'm not sure if you are being sarcastic, but Whitewater investigation of Clintons cost taxpayers nearly $60 million.  Mueller has spent about 10% of that and the crimes alleged are much greater in the Mueller probe.
t1_dudwl05	1	*	Oh, so this is only on the US then?  I was surprised, because in my country, med companies aren't free to just price their products anyway they want. They need to provide reasons for their pricing to a joined commission of med companies, med insurances, and regulatory authorities.   That way, they can still make a decent profit, but they can't just fuck over desperate sick people.
t1_dujj2v8	0	*	That is what happens when some lazy journo sources his article from Wikipedia. 
t1_dupjhi6	1	*	So the ambassador was checking bags at the associate school, discovered the drugs, called argentinean authorities, then they replaced the drugs with flour, and they were able to let the operation continue as if nothing happened? They just packed 400KGS into bags and they left them there, nobody noticing police, nor replacement 400KGS of cocaine with flour. Hmmmm....
t1_duprd09	1	*	I chuckled
t1_dupjhia	1	*	it's not exactly the zero sum game you describe it, because the eu has a clearly positive balance with the rest of the world. which means every year 100-200 billion  come in additionally.  https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/252105/umfrage/handelsbilanz-der-eu-laender/  france is clearly suffering from the low euro, but the uks problem are due to thatchers neoliberal politics. that's what happens when you deregulate and deregulate, until your entire manufacturing industry dies.

t1_duerxf8	0	*	No, it was rigged by Russia because the entirety of the American intelligence community says it was.

t1_duwabdg	1	*	The British have just as many issues with illegal Chinese fishing in the area as Argentina does... 
t1_dufynp3	0	*	This is already a policy at many Canadian universities.  The end effect is that student loans and bursaries were adjusted to the economic value of the degree as well.  It had little effect on anyone born in Canada attending other than slightly increasing the debt load for higher earners after graduation.   Foreign students that pay 2x the posted tuition rate are the real cash cow.

t1_dudzmb2	1	*	Youre getting downvoted heavy for a term that sounds a lot like pick on someone your own size  I dont wish harm on anyone. Hopefully you dont either. But I understand that if someone wants to be an aggressor, having the ability to defend yourself is important.  World politics often sound like playground politics. Hopefully it never gets to that.    I remember a few years ago the whole occupy movement.  For some reason thats coming back to me now...
t1_duh59oo	1	*	>   that we know of    Makes me wonder... You make a few big guys publicly roll over while getting bombarded by people willing to flip on other people. I imagine the entire thing is quite comical at times.

t1_dugx0zp	1	*	Can't hear you because of the sand.
t1_duqlz6c	1	*	Usually,  conspiracy means you tried  to assist or did assist someone commit a crime.  So, bob helps Joe find someone to kill his wife but doesn't actually attend the meeting and doesn't commit the murder,  etc.  The fact that he plead to conspiracy suggests the actual charge would been something larger, harder to say exactly what.

t1_dujqz7t	1	*	like that turtle
t1_duxsq5b	1	*	Youre protesting against other people choosing to wear a hijab themselves, not protesting against being forced to wear a hijab.  Its not a matter of pro-hijab or anti-hijab. Its a matter of whether or not you want women to be able to wear what they choose. If you are against women being able to wear hijabs, you and Iran are on the same side of that debate, just with different dress codes you want to force on women.

t1_duqf8i1	1	*	It's easy to hide who your donors are.  Both sides of this past election took money from overseas and nothing will come from this investigation.
t1_dut8lrk	1	*	Oh, yeah? Your numbers have already been disproven, now what about the people who suffered severe consequences of a measle infection, like becoming deaf, or at least impaired in hearing, or falling ill with Meningitis because of the virus infecting their brains? Keep drinking that Kool-Aid, man, one can only hope that it's you getting severe complicaions from contracting such a preventable disease, and not your kids or anyone around you.

t1_dup504s	1	*	Why should it cause civil unrest? Most people have more important things to do - like solving what we're going to have for dinner problem. And it's almost impossible for any kind of pro-democracy guys to prove that they don't want to return to 90s and that democracy doesn't mean poverty and humilation.
t1_dua61sc	1	*	The fact that anyone would think that that makes it any better somehow is mad. So the majority of shootings didn't kill anyone or just one person, that's totally fine suddenly.  This is madness. And it's normality for the US. All of these incidents put some people in mortal danger. 
t1_duoi6fv	1	*	Some women would get married so that they run away from their parents. Their parents will have no legal rights to do anything to their kids anymore. They cannot stop Reham from going to school, they cannot stop them from traveling, etc.

Hormonal birth control pills have adverse and unpleasant side effects for a great many women, aren't 100% effective, can be forgotten. Voluntarily sterilizing one's self is not nearly as popular an option as if it were mandatory.   Shit happens. People get pregnant. Rinse and repeat.

The situation there was never Afghanistan levels, but the Good Friday Agreement and power sharing have brought peace where decades of refusing to negotiate didn't work. Hopefully this is a step in the right direction for Afghanistan, they could do with it.
t1_dupfj66	1	*	Israel invented Waze IIRC.  Which is a pretty fancy way of saying 'Why don't we make a real time map and an annoying AI voice that tells you where to go! In an APP!'  Back then, it was sketchy too, because only GPS road trackers like Garmin and the like has those.

t1_duh3mbc	1	*	If you haven't figured it out yet, it isn't normal for a president to have almost his entire top level campaign staff be filled with Russian agents, like Manafort, Carter page, Papadaplous, Gates, etc.  Also, if you want to talk about things that happened during the campaign, Carter page, Papadapolous, Jared Kushner and Trump Jr have all been found to have been actively conspiring with Russia during the election.

t1_duhw2wb	0	*	The most effective thing you can do as an individual is to eat fewer animal products. Not driving or flying may be as effective but think how radically your life would change if you couldn't fly or had to buy an electric car.

t1_dur7l2v	0	*	You... you get that all scientists don't just work on the same thing right? It's possible to have one scientist working on pesticides and another working on the insect problem. 
t1_duspjhr	1	*	Theresa May only ever says it under massive pressure from the rest of the UK govt since she completely hedged her bets on Trump being successful to justify her own policies.

Which is why ERs are over run with homeless and poor. They have to treat you. Of course that doesnt cover scripts when released etc. I used to think it was a joke about charging for kleenex etc. Its not. I prefer canada but I am married so yeah. Bs co-pays out the ass.

The P'urxe9pecha had an extensive bronze metallurgy, more extensive than anywhere else in Mesoamerica really.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallurgy_in_pre-Columbian_Mesoamerica  It's also worth noting that the metallurgy of the Andes and the P'urxe9pecha are quite similar, enough to suggest that one is directly descended from the other.

Russia formally annexed the region.   5. People in Crimea support being part of Russia.    Sooo... there is literally no way in which Crimea doesn't belong to Russia.

t1_dufe960	0	*	But, humans do NOT have as high a mortality rate as turtles, not as juveniles, not even close. Humans also tend to clump together so finding a mate tends to be a lot less difficult.

On one hand, no one took the class seriously, even those who took it as an exam subject (unlike maybe they voluntarily chose it at junior level). We learned about religions around the world and the culture involved, and how they all relate to each other. It was kind of interesting actually. And just as important from a cultural awareness perspective as learning about say the history of different countries. 
t1_duuccpo	1	*	That's... the opposite of true. Rape has been shown time and time again to be one of the least-reported crimes because victims are shamed or socialized into thinking it's something they should be ashamed of, they had it coming, they were asking for it, it wasn't really rape, etc., or they're just scared and traumatized and don't want to talk about it. I wouldn't be surprised if most rape statistics were actually *lower* than the true number.

Nobody of sound mind should believe anything that's being stated at the moment.  What exactly are people saying has changed? Last time I checked, America's electoral system top to bottom was based on donations from people and companies who only had their own private interests at heart.

The ploblem its not that, but what are you gonna to do with this information, and almost all the time the solution is costly and only solve the problem in the long run, and people are dying in Rio right now.  So i do think that use the army to kill/ arrest some drug lords and their minions don't solve the problems, but unfortunately thats what we need right now.

Unfortunately, Amnesty International is mostly a tool for justifying foreign policy decisions of US empire. Trump is a partial threat to this, as he somewhat corrupts the facade that America actually gives a shit.

t1_dud58pk	1	*	And the WHO is not saying it is never needed. Just that there is currently a growing number of c-sections that *don't* occur for medical reasons (which your wife would qualify as) and do not benefit mother or child (C-sections are more risky, require more healing etc)
t1_dugvcy7	1	*	I've been hearing that constantly for over a year, I'll believe it when I see it. 
t1_dujmfzr	1	*	Notice how the title is worded falsely says instead of lies. Falsely says suggests maybe his memory is just bad and that it wasn't his fault for having a faulty memory. No, you are right, this is an outright blatant lie.  When are people going to call a spade a spade?

t1_dux3vun	1	*	nice try vegan boi
t1_duq4yfv	1	*	Argie here. Macri has been trying to get back on the good graces of EU and US (and it's bloody hard, they keep acussing us of dumping to stall trade and protect their agro sectors). Cristina relied too much on the Mercosur so he's probably going to try and do the opposite, but it's not set in stone. Increasing the market for our agro to Mexico sounds like a juicy deal and he wouldn't pass it up, but taking the head of a new economic bloc is waay too much to ask from us right now. 
t1_duowiye	0	*	>Prosecutors said the couple had met on internet dating site, singlemuslim.com.  Not surprised.  >She sent messages to him on the WhatsApp service with links to websites on how to make ricin. He sent her back graphic videos of IS beheadings, shootings and killings of prisoners using explosives.  And they say romance is dead.
t1_duxifcq	1	*	Because Japan knows that the current people in power didn't magically assume responsibility and the current family members aren't actually affected in any real way compared to everybody else. That, basically, it's jerking off. If nobody was interested in acknowledgements and apologies to capitalize on, Japan probably would recognize it, whatever the fuck that means.

t1_duu2j6l	1	*	its easier to frame lack of quality of life and opportunity as being caused by outsiders/some minority, than to address the issue as a complex problem.   In the first case you just need to *get rid* of them somehow. Easy solutions for the lazy minded and misinformed. 
t1_duvvfeg	1	*	Where exactly were you snorkeling/scuba diving?  I have been scuba diving off Bali and GBR (as recently as 2014) and would easily put Bali area much higher in terms of live coral reef and fish life.  You picked the wrong location.

t1_duuygoi	1	*	Lets start by shutting down all cruise ships entirely.  It is a huge source of greenhouse gases and completely unnecessary.  It doesn't cause cost to skyrocket the way putting a stop to urban sprawl or cutting back on farmland would.  Few thousand people need a new job and some cruise companies go bankrupt, big deal.

t1_dukc9ou	1	*	The investigation had some of this information before the election.  Thats why Obama pushed for sanctions which have been subsequently eased.  Thats why those Russian diplomats were expelled.  But unfortunately congress at the time wouldnt go along with any of the other recommendations.
t1_duhvbaj	0	*	I understand that youre coming from a place of pragmatism and want to try and prevent this type of thing happening however acting in that way would be letting these people win. Its akin to asking people who get burgled to stop owning things people want to steal in order to prevent burglary.
t1_duoy5k0	1	*	Any edible thing that negatively affects the mind, unless it has a legitimate medical use.  But drug addiction is an addiction for a reason, and being neighbors to the biggest opium producing nation in the world (Afghanistan) only makes things worse.

t1_durc7jj	1	*	I would imagine that part of that money that they want sent is a diplomatic way to ask for bribery money. Similar to what /u/unchatnoir mentioned. A lot of the foreign aid that richer nations give ends up at least partially as a bribe of one sort or another.

t1_dudjaa5	1	*	Other countries just have the national healthcare provider negotiate low prices with drug makers. If the drug maker says no, they basically lose all sales because the largest buyer isn't buying their drug.  Then there's countries like India which just say we are ignoring your patent for the greater good and make the drug themselves.
t1_dudjaaf	1	*	no they weren't, they were agents hired by a foreign power planted into the US with a specific, anti-democratic directive. so, really nothing to do with the 1st amendment here.

t1_dup6m9s	1	*	It's a very interesting culture. I'm half Armenian myself. The food is amazing, music is meh, country is very pretty, and the history is a roller coaster.

I'm proud of my Armenian heritage. Hope that helps.

t1_dugq6z9	1	*	Indeed.  His flip-sidey mayhemery is exactly why they seriously regret letting the precedent be set.    On the whole, Trump's tweet history will keep readers arguing about what he really meant on any topic well into the future.  Hopefully,  that history will also create enough sympathy for the US citizenry that our enemies pause before blowing us to smithereens.

t1_dukzly7	0	*	By shifting the blame the way they do, it helps create the illusion that it's too late to do anything now. Even if most people aren't gonna buy it, there's ten or fifteen other lies each day to choose from all with the same goal.
t1_durewqa	1	*	Not unless they will be forced to. The Japanese are pretty bad neighbours. Thank God China can now turn Japan into glass in 10 minutes, or else we'd see history repeat itself, what with Japan's Abe working towards getting nuclear weapons and abolishing their constitution to reinstate imperialism (Nippon Kaigi).

t1_dudzafa	1	*	The series is called Dirty Moneyon Netflix, and it will piss you off if you watch it!!!...  Which, I feel everyone should watch it.  Valeant is as about as evil as Ive seen in a corporation.  They figured out they can charge whatever they want if there are no alternatives or generic form to a drug.     My father had to take a medication for cancer, and it was $11,000 for one pill.   10 years ago, it was 200 bucks for a whole bottle of the same pill...  This is maddness.

t1_duz8zex	1	*	Yup, and we will continue to despite the fact that Putin has no strategy at all, just gret tactics.  That statement is more an inditement of the leadership we have had over the bast 25 years since the fall of the wall, rather than a compliment towards Vova.
t1_duw5em5	1	*	'fellow' strongmen
t1_duinigv	0	*	I agree. While the current generation taking power in South Korea hasn't forgotten that South Korea exists only because of US intervention, they now want to go their own way separate from US policy.  The young generation has no clue why the US is there to begin with and wants the US out.  Even though the US has poured tens of billions upon tens of billions of dollars into South Korea, I say the US should promptly leave and wish the South Koreans a happy existence under communist rule.  
t1_duqus13	1	*	True, but their kids were teenagers at the time. How old is Ivanka? 36? Not the best comparison is it? Hardly a double standard.

t1_duqn59n	1	*	No.  Treason is aiding and comforting the enemy, and has only ever been applied with respect to an active armed conflict/rebellion, excepting once related to a massive labor dispute.    Conspiracy against the United States is a catchall that can come in for conspiring to bypass various laws - usually fraudulent activity of some kind. So, a complicated system of taxfraud, moneylaundering, failing to register as a foreign agent, misleading others into the same.

t1_dund9dv	1	*	Massive population shifts from things like Syrian war and environment changes.  Because there is this large population change, it's easy for politicians to point to the other as a whipping boy.  Unfortunately people buy into it, and allow themselves to be sucked into authoritarian rule.

t1_duqphur	1	*	Lol ur dumb.
t1_dufqegi	1	*	If it makes you feel better, it would be insanely unlikely and unheard of in history for two planes to experience a tragedy like this in a single day. And if its gonna happen, defying the most ridiculous odds, the chance of it being your plane out of all the other planes flying is so slim.   I feel your pain, though. I took two flights yesterday and all I could think about each time were all the things that could go wrong and who would take care of my cat if something actually were to happen. 
t1_dumah28	1	*	As much as I hate bibi, I think the title is misleading, bibi has been recommended to be on trial for bribery  by the police several times and he still hadnt been found guilty in court (if it did actually go to court).

t1_duwy18g	1	*	As an aspiring screenwriter, I can say that it's an absolute pain. My Republican Senator character is either a strawman or unrealistically moderate or in some drafts, both.
t1_dun601a	1	*	The same reason Augustus was 'first citizen'
t1_duosyi4	1	*	What you mean, Russian connection? I am simple lover of burling strong man named Sterling Archer.
t1_dua5jge	1	*	Correct - US Schools are no gun zones. Even those citizens that have passed a concealed carry course are not allowed to have their firearm anywhere on campus including their vehicle by law. Only LEO / resource officers are allowed by law to carry on school property. 
t1_duro0de	1	*	An interesting article on how farmers deal with this dissonance.  https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/28/business/energy-environment/navigating-climate-change-in-americas-heartland.html
t1_duyk2h4	0	*	No, hes taking prisoners. There are people going to jail.
t1_duo4d1w	1	*	What's bad? Following the law?   What's wrong with people liking their leader? And there were multiple not so likeable leaders between Stalin and Putin.
t1_duwrch2	1	*	Profit. That's literally it. It profits some people greatly to destroy the planet. 
t1_dunqtqz	0	*	He died yesterday. 
t1_durphv7	1	*	> Current PM can't even control his Deputy shooting loads into the staffers, how's he going to pretend he can control firearms?  Okay mate, you almost ready?  . . . Alright . . .take your time . . . Alright NOW! Aim for the bellybut . . . No! Not inside . . . FUCK! I said not to do that!
t1_dugsnuk	1	*	They've been interpreted that way in federal court numerous times. I'd say that's pretty good confirmation.
t1_dup4vl6	1	*	Damn.  Maybe we should move some troops over there just in case!!
t1_duxcsrh	1	*	The U.S. regime can go fuck itself, too. The last thing we need is them spreading nukes to anyone.

t1_dui83sz	0	*	Yup, just let their money trickle down to us, what could go wrong? 
t1_dumbn2r	1	*	I have a lot of Filipino people at the school I attend in Arizona, and of the ones I've talked to (about 8) all of them are extremely supportive of him and get very defensive when you are critical of him
t1_dushj8w	1	*	Seriously. I cant believe the times we live in... 2018: Falcon heavy with a fucking Tesla Roadster attached to it heads towards Mars Also 2018: Lets arm teachers and turn school into fucking prisons
t1_dusvjo1	1	*	This is the part that got me. He thinks it is unfair that he has to admit something he said was wrong. This says it all. 
t1_dunelbp	1	*	Damn jihadists.
t1_dujs73u	1	*	They're probably living in the reality based world rather than the complete fantasy you just described.
t1_duttiop	1	*	More importantly, is there any correlation between the rising migrant population and the recent crash in crypto prices?
t1_dutdmie	1	*	I'd say there's as many who support Xi as those who are against his rule.
t1_dui2ygx	1	*	Have a young family (2 kids under6 with twins due in the summer), can confirm.   Our rent accounts for about 33% of our household income. That's before council tax, water, sewage, gas, electric, phone, TV license, petrol, insurance and um... food. And clothes cos kids are always growing out of them.
t1_duj0xor	1	*	Your NASA link is only Antarctica, only one study (Zwally et. al), and the authors say that the tiny gains will be short lived.
t1_dus0ncr	1	*	The best thing I can suggest is the [Potholer54](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCljE1ODdSF7LS9xx9eWq0GQ) series on climate change.  He does a fantastic job at addressing these issues.    https://youtu.be/52KLGqDSAjo  
t1_durk5a5	1	*	You can estimate prehistoric temperatures based on geological data but it's a pretty loose estimate. 
t1_dussitm	1	*	I never understood why people not just make an encrypted container and put that on the cloud. Might be a syncing horror for phones though. Then again I don't directly see a personal reason to use an online storing service.
t1_du9xv94	0	*	In mother Russia there is no mother Russia!  I posted this about Russia the other day What? Who me!?!?!?!?! It is the standard Russian response they are like the Iraqi information Minister when we were in Baghdad.. He claimed nothing was wrong and in the background buildings smoked and bombs exploded.
t1_dup7a58	1	*	I mean, it's an Israeli news source so they don't gain anything from incriminating their own citizens when it comes to their plight.
t1_dupj8nr	1	*	Pushing off on bobsleds is critical and the more power in the push off onto the track the faster the time you can achieve.
t1_ducuq8b	1	*	Yea im sure Saudi and Iran will start to pool their military resources aaaaany day now....
t1_duflo1w	1	*	You're right.  Having the worlds largest economy which influences every other in the world is definite proof of the downfall of America.  Or maybe, just maybe, the news is a bit sensationalized to help sell.   I dunno....
t1_duqzldj	1	*	Its called an interim clearance.
t1_duksn68	0	*	Opposition research isn't illegal. Christophere Steele was no longer a spy. He was a private citizen, working for an American firm.
t1_dums82j	0	*	sauce?
t1_dubi12g	1	*	Help's force policy spending through public perception.  It's indirect and obviously vulnerable as shit to gaming but the way a lot of policy works.  If you leak something emotive and preferably basic to convince voters there's a specific problem Y that can be addressed directly via solution X the implementing of solution X becomes a public issue.   
t1_duo3r07	0	*	More like crispy
t1_dumr7ar	1	*	Yeah really like whats the deal?
t1_dusj5i2	1	*	America First is not hate speech.  If your government is signing deals with other countries that basically punish your citizens (TPP, Paris Accord), then they're doing something wrong.
t1_dupkw7h	1	*	except Volkswagen. I hope that is not indicative of a culture that finds benefits to lying about the environment for gain. 
t1_dud29u6	0	*	Unfortunately their hands are tied unless he is an imminent threat to himself or others. He may not have been at the time. Also laws have changed so it is now very difficult to involuntary commit someone.  Edit: a word
t1_dur6ckx	0	*	The hunger of Haitians never seems to register. Doesnt demonstrate the failure of capitalism either.
t1_duq52t4	1	*	The problem is not religion dude. There's nothing wrong with religion. It's bad, sick people that try to manipulate religion and warp it to justify evil means. Religion does way more god than harm. 
t1_duo2ibx	1	*	Aka progress as seen by the politico 
t1_duc0pug	1	*	We are the great filter. 
t1_duogbv6	1	*	[ummmm](https://media.giphy.com/media/13VSAbTVuYJfLa/giphy.gif)

t1_duf6ckj	0	*	THIS. I'm shaking my head right now.. Grow. Mushrooms. Mushrooms solve fucking everything. Have shit? Don't want shit? Make it dirt, with Mushrooms. Have E. coli? Make it dirt, with Mushrooms. Have Mushrooms? Eat them, feed them to animals, or make them dirt.

t1_dur7cdi	0	*	Have you seen their prices? 15 chf for a simple Currywurst in Zxfcrich. I dont want to see their housing market.
t1_dujo9ta	1	*	>  but how is it fair to characterize I don't believe they interfered as a contradiction to I never said Russia did not meddle in the election?   Because if you have basic reading comprehension that's a blatant lie.
t1_duhzuor	1	*	That sounds like some super villain shit. 
t1_dugbvxy	1	*	You dope in curling because literally every one of your athletes from every sport are doping. There is state sponsored doping at every level in your country. Kind of hard not to dope when you've seen another guy who didn't having a conversation with a mobster/government goon about how it would Be a shame if your family disappeared because you didn't go along with this - fuck, I'd dope, too, and I'm not even an athlete. I'd do it just in case!

t1_dupf6jf	1	*	Must just be the purge every day in South Korea...
t1_dua9hd8	1	*	Even if you account for all that, the poor on average live shorter than the rich.
t1_duc4qhp	0	*	In Australia we were told by our right wing media it was because we were eating too much smashed avocado on toast!
t1_duc2fzn	0	*	1910s history written by Dutch politicians who were pissed of by Erdoan. I'm not even talking about Armenians who attacked Turkish villages and killed children and women, before 1914.
t1_duec34m	1	*	Trust me, general population wise it may appear that way, but military leaders around the world have contingency after contingency and this is definitely on their radar. 
t1_duwd2cg	1	*	And hello thought crimes. U0001f62d
t1_duffn9i	1	*	Exactly! People should have a choice wether they want to or not. I know of many people who have been circumcised as they got older. I also dont know if anyone that has ever complained about being circumcised. Same goes for the other side.
t1_duhm0tb	1	*	Its almost like theres been some mind boggling decisions voters have made at the polls the last couple of years that suggests they might actually be effective...
t1_due7be6	1	*	For people who have no idea what Valeant have done, please go check out the Netflix documentary the Dirty Money. 
t1_duc65u0	1	*	You seem to know about these kinds of things - for those of us without much additional room for trees, is there a trusted organization we could donate to (to plant trees) or another good way to help fight global warming beyond simply reducing power usage and getting out to vote?
t1_dujq1c7	1	*	lol is that the best you guys got?
t1_dunrn08	1	*	Everything seems easy to replace, granted paper bags aren't as sturdy but doable. Issue is, straws. What decent alternative is there? Paper straws suck barnacles. 
t1_dugv5h7	1	*	Why on earth would they want that? It's big news with every bout of verbal diarrhea 
t1_duuo3h8	1	*	I vote for citizens vote on issues and executive orders too but our simple majority counts as a percentage of the total vote count.
t1_duqa510	1	*	They're only doing what the US has done to other countries for decades.
t1_duxe8ag	1	*	There are pockets well on their way.
t1_dumpn1j	0	*	No one is saying that. No one is saying they will pay to train and arm teachers.  I am trained, I am armed. If I was a teacher I would want to have my gun...  Y'all never had an ex military teacher?  I had at least 5 teachers who were former military or police.
t1_duf70hq	1	*	*Makes a mental note to avoid the Millennium Tower*
t1_duhkuts	1	*	You can say the same about United Kingdom, Italy, France and other leagues/countries in Europe. Just google league name + racism. There are idiots in every country.

t1_duehxtu	1	*	Exchange rate:   750 yen = $7.06 /hr   100 yen = $9.41 /hr  So ballpark with the US where the federal minimum wage is $7.25
t1_dukjcgp	0	*	Beta Blockers are considered a PED in the shooting sports. Not even eligible for a therapeutic exception.  
t1_dun9ixg	1	*	We should never forget that these populations were in thousands at best.
t1_dupaatm	1	*	When I was in Iraq, we carried our weapons everywhere. 100% of the time, except the shower. Even then, you left it with a battle buddy until you finished. We were all well-trained on safe use of the weapon.  But we still had a bunch of accidental discharges. People got shot because of whoopsies. In intense situations, the wrong people got hit. Stressful times make for bad decisions.  And we weren't allowed alcohol, so...just imagine.
t1_duw42c5	1	*	I'd send in Melanie. Shit. I have seen zoolander. Okay, I know what professional models are capable of.
t1_duc2ckx	1	*	This.   The oligarch filed a lawsuit on violation of his privacy.   A court decided that those videos should be removed.   Russia's communications regulator started to send notifications that those videos should be removed, according to that court decision.   Those websites that didn't comply, e.g. Navalny's website, were blocked.   Instagram did comply. 
t1_dum6k29	1	*	Putin is a dictator who robs his people blind and they bend over for more. For shame, Russia, for shame.
t1_dui96cm	1	*	Does Bill Gates pay more taxes than what is required of him?
t1_duyoy2u	1	*	Are you questioning the will of the 51.9%!!!  Traitor! Get the daily mail to front page u/haltres as a traitor to Britain!

t1_duh7w02	1	*	Oops, looks like there's some antisemitism in Tel Aviv.
t1_duhmlmx	1	*	Don't blame them they are just people acting on their incentives, it isn't their fault.
t1_duhxsl8	1	*	We haven't reduced emissions this decade.  Analogy time: we can still  run a debt after decreasing the deficit.  Even if your point was true it would not debunk anything.  The world is complicated, take it seriously.
t1_duthdjd	1	*	What was the point of linking that list? If you actually give your kid everything on there, that's pretty stupid. Why would you need the inactivated polio vaccine as well as the live oral one, or the tetanus and Hep B vaccines in addition to DTaP AND a pentavalent with those 4 plus *Haemophilus influenzae*? Or vitamin A for that matter?

t1_dubw1ov	0	*	Meanwhile we're decreasing the size of our national parks so we can drain them of their natural resources.   Not so much we, though, because your average citizen won't benefit at all.    EDIT: https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/12/04/567803476/trump-dramatically-shrinks-2-utah-national-monuments

t1_duw9aw2	0	*	stupd question: if the ice melts and it won't be that cold in the arctic, does that mean that there is no cold air to come and cool siberia and canada? no arctic vortex = no cold air = HAHC (hot arctic, hot continents)?

t1_duw7sp2	1	*	Isn't it being warm on the poles the same thing? It's weather change not climate change.
t1_duarkpm	1	*	Except the name is clearly spraypainted on a pile of cleared snow, that isn't a snow drift as the article is claiming it to be nor is it in the road or the same area shown being cleared later.
t1_duurksi	1	*	r/nottheonion is for actual news that seems like it's the Onion. I think what you mean is you have to check to see if it *is* the Onion.

t1_dupbraq	0	*	Finally. Americans using the metric system. 
t1_dumxb5z	1	*	Just like getting every idiot to believe that anything they don't like seeing is ok account of Russian trolls. Then we won't be able to trust any piece of information thanks to idiots blaming trolls for everything.  You're working in their favor by believing this Russia propaganda.
t1_dut3un9	1	*	Amen 
t1_duiu3uo	1	*	Bill Gates just wants to make sure hes good during the poor uprising /s it is cool to see him speak on it

t1_ducrkag	1	*	Not like anyone was gonna do anything about it anyways.
t1_duq7ale	1	*	We should really think about cutting the budget for DEFENDING GERMANY.
t1_duwiy1h	1	*	Considering the 'hate speech' laws in effect... This is the next step.  Governments ripping kids out of their homes from families of people who oppose their ideologies - and using this threat to keep people living in fear of the government.  WAKE UP PEOPLE!
t1_duxkzvh	0	*	That's the optimist version. The pessimist one is that they are actually blackmailing him.

t1_duu6msk	0	*	There's less arctic sea ice at this point of winter than ever recorded. It's not a 'one day anomaly' thing. This is just recognising the newest peak in one measurable (temp)
t1_duqv0ze	1	*	Fuck military? Entirely? Yeah, but no, not very smart.
t1_durqvwg	1	*	 privacy is the new democracy!
t1_duxlhla	0	*	We'd still be behind Germany/France/UK regardless. We lack that entrepreneurship culture many western states have, lots of red tape and we're don't give enough fucks in many situations where westerners would.
t1_dunmqks	1	*	Not really. Can't speak for the whole country, but honestly, I don't give a shit about Navalny being detained again. This dude is a professional opposition attention whore, and I suppose in many cases he actually expects to be detained. So nothing new here  I also don't feel any unrest or oppression. It actually feels pretty comfy here in Moscow lately.
t1_dukdsov	1	*	Honestly if this plan isn't stable genius then idk what is...
t1_dul2ssv	1	*	My dad seriously thinks the more information that comes out about Russia meddling in the election/mueller investigation, the worse it'll be for Obama and Hilary.  He honestly thinks they'll go to jail for this.

t1_dund4m2	0	*	Pla?
t1_dutwtzk	1	*	No. They have been trying to talk to the US alone for years. US just wants 6 party talks which are a no go, too many conflicting interests. 
t1_dua5lol	0	*	Yup. Why not start by restricting what a news agency can report? Because it is too difficult. Why not restrict gun ownership? Because it is hard. Why not reform mental health? Because it is too hard  Americans have gotten complacent and as a nation can't do anything that is too difficult. Lazy and unmotivated like a 3rd generation wealthy kid who has no idea how to do anything good for someone else.
t1_duy8zs9	1	*	Damn, that sucks.
t1_dushpeo	1	*	I have to disagree with you - depending on where you live in the states, raging nationalism can be very common. I would like to think that *most* Americans could see the dangers and the irrationality of American exceptionalism and isolationism, but I dont think thats the case right now.
t1_dux8qeh	1	*	This will happen when the U.S. does the same to the Decendants of Slaves (African American) for the 300+ years of slavery and systemic racist government policies that followed. I won't hold my breath on that.
t1_duskp9k	1	*	> Most countries know they just have another 3 yrs to wait out the crazy  Most countries aren't waiting it out, they're working to benefit from Trump's incompetence. America has vacated its leadership role and now other powers are vying for the position.

t1_ducscl9	0	*	Hmm, Im safe. I spend a lot of time talking about how Trump is an imbecile leading a cult of brainwashed sociopaths, but my account is three years old and I dont think too many paid CTR Soros Antifa Clinton FBI [more buzzword] shills put equal time into posts about the PGA Tour, power metal, Northwestern sports and furry memes.
t1_duxmxr5	1	*	Hardly makes the Nazis look tame. 
t1_dufqone	1	*	An airplane can be old and still work just like new. Many militaries still use airframes from the 60-70s.   The only problem that arises is that yoy need more maintenance intervals.

t1_dulg5bs	1	*	Yes, and yes
t1_dultdga	1	*	I'd be surprised if Trump got through his presidency without starting a war. There's just too much profit in it for him to resist.
t1_duh9za0	1	*	I was thinking the same thing.
t1_duebj7v	1	*	What cause could be better?\s
t1_dujit6i	1	*	I knew you guys would show up!
t1_durg8wk	1	*	What makes you say they dont acknowledge it ? And what is wrong with having survivors tell their stories? Every country has that, there is nothing odd about it. Not everything has to fit into your narrative. That would detrimental to the history. All sides have their story and it all brings nuance to what happened. For some reason people just wont Japan do it. We shouldnt forget what some of their units did, but we shouldnt silence the survivors either. Let them speak.
t1_dud7zic	1	*	now now! The justice system is not for vengeance! It's for rehabilitation! I am sure he can be rehabilitated in just a year or two with the proper education and all the loving care your taxes can provide!

t1_dudoebf	1	*	This is interesting to me because it's amazing.
t1_duuzm6k	1	*	You mean prohibition?  Somehow I think that was a little more extreme than requiring a minimum xa314 for a fifth of whiskey. 
t1_duylii1	1	*	But wait...he knows nothing about Putin and he doesn't even know Russia exists, no one has met with any Russians, that's fake news, witch hunt, etc...
t1_dupbcca	1	*	From someone who was one year old at the time, sick at home with heart problems, while the rebels try to drag my parents to the protest saying my life worth much less than China's democracy ...

t1_dubdu9u	0	*	Would a person wearing a heart monitor show signs of both of these types of stroke if they were to have one while taking blood-thinners?
t1_dupui34	1	*	Have one hell of a rager.
t1_dutcchq	0	*	You will never stand up to an oppressive government with rifles when the state will bombard your entire neighborhood to rubble with missiles in seconds. See: Syrian civil war.
t1_duwoasz	0	*	I should trade in my toyota for a six digit roadster?  I'm usually the first person to make fun of someone saying check your privilege but I think you just convinced me.  That said yeah really y'all try to make some changes.  You don't have to go vegan but for sure eat less meat.  Toyota and Ford make hybrids too if you can afford to pick.  Don't fuck with Styrofoam but that's a different ecological issue?  Get solar panels for your house if you can.  There's all kinds of shit that helps.
t1_dulldny	1	*	I'd argue that I's actually really bad that they're no longer mandatory. People *should* be informed about world religions, and learn to look at them from a critical perspective - Even including their own religion.  Not making such classes mandatory just makes it easier for religious parents and communities to continue indoctrinating their young.
t1_dutkmtl	1	*	yeah I read the headline and was looking at the photos side-by-side like well good, looks like a gasline thing

t1_duqxjej	0	*	The correct response to any claim is to question its evidence, especially when that claim is in the field of science or mathematics. If we didnt do that, science literally could not progress, and we would be 3000 years behind on math. 
t1_dumhayw	0	*	Its a fantastic cleanser - my wife's lab uses it to clean down everything. She uses cheap vodka to clean wounds as well, though I prefer peroxide personally.

t1_dunq3an	1	*	Incidentally Aljazeera has been voted one of the most unbiased news sources for a number of years
t1_durovkt	1	*	And how often has the US talked about Japanese Internment camps?   Every side has some dirty secret from the World Wars, it doesn't absolve any of them, but trying to refute memorial efforts around one atrocity by demanding respect for another gets us nowhere but arguing in circles.
t1_duj40kx	1	*	Don't stereotype gay men like this. We're just big slobs too
t1_dueto28	1	*	When any of you say the Russia investigation is done, I always imagine you saying it in the highest pitched voice possible. As if it's almost a question. The answer to that question is that it isn't nearly over. SAD.

t1_duggv83	1	*	Or at least fired...from a cannon...into the sun
t1_duz4eqq	1	*	Dirty Money on Netflix already has a good piece on Trump's business deals over the years. Ties to people we know are corrupt just for licensing deals. Also touches on the brutally deceitful Trump University.

t1_dul85l3	0	*	Fuck, that's why I believe politicians and leaders shouldn't swear by the bible. Government and Faith should be completely separate, yeah lets lead this country on the grounds of a 2000+ year old heavily manipulative scripture full of tales of rape, torture, incest, hate and violence.
t1_dubr9cq	1	*	That and disaster relief.

t1_duom2fd	1	*	The bigger question is whether Taiwan will be able to enforce it by 2030 or has to instead abide by Chinese communist laws.  But I think in any case, the one country two system will likely at least take place first.
t1_dut2q1m	0	*	>Most Americans are aware that America First is hate-speech no different than white power!  America First really resonates with my family and I. I ain't white and I was born to two naturalized immigrants.   Tell me, what is wrong with exalting one's homeland and valuing one's neighbours over far-flung strangers? Is it not natural?

t1_dudb39f	0	*	That's so cool. They had a lot going on.  I believe our understanding of American  (N +S) history is set to be expanded in the, hopefully, near future. Progress isn't always linear and it's crazy not to imagine people's living south of the ice sheet may have thrived more than just once; as only now recognized. 
t1_duydv4g	1	*	Dark, but funny.

t1_duhhco1	1	*	While technically correct, the fact that current temperatures are increasing faster than ever, mean that 1. once warming is done, it might well be hotter than ever, and 2. we still have to deal with the effects of global warming whether it's man-made or not, so we might as well slow it down as much as possible, and learn to deal with the outcomes.

t1_dudse9o	1	*	Agreed. Turkey should recognize it & celebrate it. I view it as quite the accomplishment of my ancestors. Mongols are rightly proud of the conquests and accomplishments of Genghis Khan, so why shouldn't Turks be proud of clearing out an ethnic group of a vast swath of their historic lands? Its just a shame the Young Turks didn't finish the job, now we're stuck hearing the Armenians complain about it non-stop.

While I totally agree that their culture is just backwards, inability to put shoe on the other foot, while still talking about how beautiful muslim culture is (lolwhat) is mesmerizing to watch.

t1_dulazkk	0	*	How naive. Every major developed country exports military arms. Why should the UK *unilaterally* dismantle one of its best industries? We should put the British armament workers and their families before the citizens of another country which are being oppressed by their own governments or murdered by others, all of which would still be able to acquire such weapons from other nations if the UK withheld arms exports.

t1_duptzrx	1	*	413$ per person in Canada vs 495 per person in Germany?  I hadn't realized that we spent so little per capita on defense. Then again our main threats are from the Americans or the White Walkers, neither of which are especially likely.

I don't think that is going to happen and sooner rather than later reality is going to catch up with him. Now that Gates has taken a plea he knows he is screwed & I would not be surprised if he disappeared in the next few weeks as the enormity of what he now faces hits him.

t1_durdu72	1	*	That is the point of the amendments.  Its not some sacred document.  The original writers knew times would change.  It is why it allows for amendments.  They wrote the second amendment at a time where it took 10 minutes to load a gun, and the Brits could come and take your land at any moment.  Clearly times have changed.

t1_duee3h0	1	*	Would be awesome if they somehow got a list of every employee of the IRA (Russian troll army) and did the same to every single one of them. Would hopefully deter a lot of Russians open to doing that for a job from doing it. Right now, I am sure many rationalize it to themselves as harmless and easy money, though sure there are many that are far right, support Putin and Trump, and share similar views that they spam social media with.

t1_duwkhzn	0	*	That's just unnecessarily high.   Edit: Seems like this is perfectly fine for a lot of you. I'm not saying doctors should not be rewarded for their effort and it's a vital role they play for certain. I'm saying that a significant cut to that sum could go to underpaid staff and doctors would still make a LOT of money per month. Unless you want taxpayers to pay the price for this one too.
t1_durp15l	1	*	Meh howard made one good decision, but i would argue his sandy hook call was about as easy to make as turnbulls gay marriage one. Both of them are total muppets that have no real aspirations for the country. 
t1_duwomty	1	*	I see posts like this on reddit and laugh about how we are all in our own little bubble. hur di dur, there is no hope in the world blah blah blah. A normal trope in history.

t1_duv120i	0	*	edit: I stand corrected. I think what I meant  was that his 'policy solution' isn't actually changing much at ground level.    It's mostly lip service and death squads aimed at making it look like a very much inflated problem is being taken care of.

t1_durw5zb	0	*	There's been stories like these since the beginning of the Syrian conflict that was started by Assad brutally murdering and torturing dissidents and moving on to the application of chemical weapons. If he and his cronies don't want negative press coverage, maybe mass murder is something he should avoid. This is bad enough that the UN Security Council, including Russia, voted 15-0 to demand a 30 humanitarian ceasefire.

t1_dupk693	1	*	There certainly is a lot to criticize about GDP and governments around the world need to stop relying on it so heavily. I always liked [Bobby Kennedy's speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6U2irFSYHo) about it. Although it's of course a bit cheesy, it gets the general point across quite well.

I'm saying that we need to stop lynching these dudes until something has been proven. It sucks, but its what our country's justice system is based on... Innocent until proven guilty. Lately, with the #metoo movement, that has been the complete opposite, and it isn't right.  But yeah, you're right.
t1_dujaeeg	1	*	Don't mind the article headline, the headline is propaganda. The commercial is just about getting out to vote and is a comedy skit about a guy not caring about voting waking up to a government that demands ridiculous shit like limited bathroom visits, officers dabbing, forced foster care of single gay men, and drafting the elderly. It never mentions Putin or any candidate at all.  That this is about any Russian candidate and is a commercial about fueling fears is actually the lie.

t1_dup2uet	0	*	My problem with this logic is that why are school shooting like the one in Florida and mass shootings like the one in Las Vegas so common only in America out of any Western country? Surely other Western countries have bullies and people suffer from depression, but if the issue does not lie in guns then where else does America's unique problem stem from?

t1_duok0my	0	*	Look at it this way: if these are the best people Don could find, aren't you glad he didn't hire worse?
t1_duyi1ti	1	*	Yes, its pretty bad alright. Having been to the court (as an observer!) a very high number of previous convictions is far from uncommon, especially for drug users. Chronically addicted people should be able to get their supply via a Drs assessment and prescription, to prevent all the attendant crime. But thats another story!

These people's stories are the only ones we have about the misery of eating the bomb.
t1_duii1zl	1	*	Yep. The childcare costs in particular are ludicrous. I left the UK to live in Austria years back and we paid around 400 a month for full time child care which was less than 30% of what my sister pays for childcare per month in Cambridge. 
t1_duxyzg7	0	*	Yeah yeah, Muslims are the most conservative people in the world, yet liberals want to convert everyone and create a global Islamic theocracy. That'll surely further the gay atheist agenda.

t1_dusmw2j	0	*	Russia is like the school bully who causes troubles then starts pointing fingers on others. 
t1_duy80r8	1	*	Yep, no different in South Africa. Our labour market absorption rate is something like 44% and if this legislation passes will probably worsen, as we lose any investor confidence and a large chunk of our FDI.    People are impatient, angry and want immediate change and our politicians sell them the dream. How can we grow our economy, and improve the job prospects of South Africans, when we have politicians disregarding ratings agencies and labeling them imperialist yardsticks?

t1_dua9osb	0	*	Your last part is completly inaccurate.  Primaries are not a constitutionally mandated device, nor are they binding.

t1_dunh58p	1	*	To me, this is sacrificing convenience. I don't know how they plan on replacing utensils and straws, how are people going to eat things they would normally require a knife and a fork? How are people going to drink beverages while walking/driving/any other activity where you don't want to end up pouring a cup's worth of liquid all over your chest?   Plastic cups and containers can easily be replaced by cardboard containers, but some things just need to stay plastic IMO. 
t1_duv2epw	1	*	oof!  (doubles over)
t1_dujyat4	1	*	Help keep a straight out revolt from happening and keeping international ties. If he doesn't do this, it could give a lot of people ammunition and excuses they need to justify taking action against him.

t1_dutur6y	1	*	The Trump administration created this opportunity
t1_duxsd6n	0	*	It's not about defending Japan for me it's about who is trying to take the high road here and acting holier than thou(americans).    Koreans have every right to demand justice.    It's just funny seeing americans going gung ho about it considering there was no apology for slavery every.

t1_dutkxsh	1	*	Go all the way back to the mid late 90s where the US(yes your holy land of good people) was busy hacking just about every questionable nation on earth routinely and developed a massive network of DDOS hosts to hack and attack from and this is part of the mission - Dominate and control a new frontier while winning hearts and minds in a way that has failed entirely for over 100 years. Cyberwarfare became a thing. Even a joked about crappy name thing.

t1_dubn91i	1	*	Because it's easy to write off the opinions of actual Americans with 'unpopular' opinions by calling them russian shills or nazis. This is where we are in American politics. This is the future we chose.
t1_duph63r	1	*	Quite decent.
t1_duy3d3w	0	*	Sadly, yes. Forced confiscation (really, forced anything) is never a precursor to better ethnic/racial/national relations.   Although since the victims in this case are white, they will probably receive very little media or activist attention, so the rest of the world can go on pretending it's not happening. I hope I'm wrong, but there's a powerful narrative about victimhood and skin color right now, and this situation definitely doesn't fit that narrative.

Hell Google cia in Yugoslavia Sarajevo times article the platforms change but the game is still the same.  That said the US doesn't have a gun problem, (they will need them to protect themselves from future oppression from corporations) the US has a problem with rampant mental illness, terrible inequality, hopelessness and a unhappy population that also hates their own government IMO

t1_dumo6ci	1	*	[Everyone is descended from everyone if you go far back enough.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedigree_collapse)  It remains to be seen if it was due to disease or what, since mostly ancient invasions like these were gendercides, not genocides. The women and young girls would be taken as wives and thus pass on their genes. Due to the above linked effect of pedigree collapse though all Britons are descendants of the 10% the article mentions.
t1_dustdxh	1	*	But Trump sounded like he *really* meant it. The only reason he refused to say how was because he wanted to keep his cards close to his chest.   - Some gullible Trumper.

Still keep the regular normal human anti-doping olympics.  Still keep the paralympics as well  I'd be very interested to see what the human body can achieve with science  Side Note:  there should be a Platinum Medal awarded on top of a gold medal if you break a world record.

t1_durtidy	1	*	I don't think any foreign leader would be stupid enough to get baited into saying one thing or another about such a hot button issue to the US.   Effectively no comment  is the smart thing to do.

He could make this private beach area to provide first-class services, like servants, free food, rent boat and all kinds of entertainment devices... then charge $1000 for one person, that should be able to block 99% (if not all) of the people.
t1_dugqjee	0	*	These leaks may very well be a deliberate decision by the Mueller camp. Leaking stuff like this makes people panic, panicked people make mistakes. Letting Manafort hear this on the news and then stew over it might make him more receptive to flipping.

t1_ducz5mb	0	*	Look at that, it's up to 411 million in 19 minutes.   On average, there are over 686 MILLION tweets sent per day. And people think 200,000 made a difference.   Yes, Russia interfered in the election, no it did not have an effect on the election as much as some want to believe it did.
t1_dugr80y	1	*	Ive never wanted to be a Canadian more in my life. I had an opportunity that I was unable to take and I regret it every single day. 
t1_dusnmi1	1	*	Agree 100%.   I think OAR should absolutely **not** appear in the national medal standings. Let individual athletes compete, fine, but medal standings reflect national performance. Showing OAR in the medal table defeats the entire purpose of the ban, as you suggested.

t1_durn5j5	0	*	China doesn't really care about your data.  You are outside of their jurisdiction. They mostly spy on their own citizens, just like how the NSA spies on us.   That being said, the US would most certainly have the capability of getting your data from any other country, possibly using illegal means.  Same goes for China. But the difference is China can't do shit to you because you live in America. The US can theoretically do whatever they damn well please with your data.
t1_durd88w	1	*	If you mean moving aircraft, that was done. New aircraft were flown in.   Although it is also worth noting that it was made very clear that any idllib rebel based offensives would result in Russian aircraft returning.   the rebels there attempting to bomb a Russian base, starting new offensives, and most importantly shooting down a Russian jet saw the return of aircraft.   We saw similar behavior the last time a Russian jet was shot down, although the response this time seems far more limited.
t1_dukbbbs	1	*	We suck.

t1_duhx3fc	1	*	There haven't been reductions. People have reduced CO2 emissions per energy source, but they've also increased the number of energy sources, so it's somewhat level at around 36 billion tons per year. Because of this, atmospheric CO2 levels are still increasing at around 2.5 ppm per year.

t1_dui5hbo	0	*	It makes a lot of sense. Its the same strategy as the Republicans vs Democrats in the US. You create two teams and then create hate between those teams.  Divide and rule. Has always worked, will always work. Because common people are stupid.  Wouldn't be surprised if many of those articles were of Russian origin. After all, the Independent is owned by a Russian oligarch.

t1_dui9xb0	1	*	>Its stupid that I have to pay a much higher tax rate than billionaires and trust fund kids who never lift a fucking finger.   You probably don't. The rich are usually have an effective taxe rate around 15%+ based on investment income. The effective tax rate for most people in the US is lower than that, especially if you own a home. For reference, my effective tax rate this year was 13.3%

t1_dui63qg	0	*	There are also tax breaks to help landlords buy up more rental properties - and they can use equity from their own house as a deposit.   A lot of the houses you see are cash only now! 
t1_dugqehq	1	*	Trump is like an ostrich. Instead of thinking people cant see him if he cant see them, he thinks if he cant remember things (or at least pretends he cant), no one else can remember them. 
t1_duno9hy	0	*	Thinking about this. The thing that makes a handgun dangerous enough to warrant 21 still applies to semi-automatic rifles.   At 18-20 we should just say shotguns and bolt actions.   If you're in a hunting party of related 21+ people and they want you to shoot an M4, sure no problem. Just can't buy it or keep it.

t1_dukewtr	1	*	Yes, just leave it up to an underfunded charity. That'll work out well fo sure.

Since none of them will answer questions voluntarily or truthfully (they all keep lying their asses off!), heavy handed charges are the method of choice.   
t1_dusq27k	1	*	I wonder when these Russians will want to take a holiday in Germany or France 
t1_duug35t	0	*	I had a lecture in democracy vs. dictatorship and the most important part of his lecture was that after the Cold War ended democracy was seen as THE legitimate government form. This forced a lot of countries to adopt democratic looking government but in reality they are still dictatorships. 
t1_ducgki7	1	*	That's the crazy thing with TPP. I guess countries were already getting used to that idea before it even gets signed.

The richest 1% of Americans also own 40% of assets.  > if he wants to write a check to the government, they'll take it. Gates doesn't need to wait for a legislature to authorize confiscation of more of his wealth.  That's not how any of this works. You don't have to be poor to criticize wealth disparity and tax loopholes.
t1_duzbm6z	0	*	...Trump and Co.
t1_duhp3oh	1	*	This isn't normal, the rate of change is much quicker than past climate change and so it's harder for ecosystems to cope. Aside from the rate if change, any significant climatic change poses a serious problem for our civilisation as we've established all of our cities and practices around an assumption of a certain stable climate. Any change will create disruption.

t1_dug1337	1	*	This is never good to know. I just feel so bad for those passengers and crew
t1_dug5de5	0	*	Don't know why you're getting downvoted. The first thing I thought when I read the article was that it might mean they end up having more hatchlings. The number of new turtles every year is limited by the number of (fertilized) females. So as long as the number of males is not zero or too low to service the increased ratio of females, it should have a net effect of increasing the overall numbers.

t1_duqnybn	1	*	Firing the guy directly investigating you for a crime, makes you look guilty of a crime, does not stop the bureaucratic effort to investigate the crime, and means that the guy fired may just choose to go public with the full details as a final screw you. Keep in mind that he already fired the FBI director so its not like they aren't trying.

There is a cop-gang operating like this in Moscow, dozens of people were prosecuted and ended up in jail. Same stories happen in Saint Petersburg. And these are just the cases we know about.

t1_durfgnd	1	*	My grandfather passed away a few years ago, but chose to stay in Venezuela rather than come live with us in the US for a number of reasons. He was a highly regarded OB/GYN with not only his own doctorate but had been the recipient of several honorary doctorates from other institutions. Despite the state of the country, to many its still home, and for some people it can still be hard to leave. However, as time goes on its only getting worse and I cant imagine he wouldve still refused today.

The economy of Turkey, the modernisation of Turkey, and also our armed forces. People are thankful for him because life truly became much better in Turkey because of Erdogan. If our country goes to war, i am 99% sure our people will voluntarily fight for it. I would, at least.

t1_dunjybi	0	*	Ban the fishing of Tuna. I couldn't agree more, tbh, they're filled [with mercury](https://www.edf.org/oceans/mercury-alert-canned-tuna-safe) regardless of species. Since it's an apex predator, just like sharks, mercury bioaccumulates in them and they end up being toxic. It's healthier to just leave them alone + better for their populations and the marine ecosystems. Most Tuna species, with the exception of swordfish (which is technically a tuna) are near endangered or endangered.

t1_duvzr1g	1	*	Their name literally means books/education is against Islam. Its so messed up. 
t1_duam0pc	1	*	Raise your hand if you're surprised by this. No one? Did anyone really expect that Bush was so staunchly supporting the Iraqi people out of the goodness of his heart and for the concern of the Iraqi people? If you've ever believed that, I've got a really nice bridge to sell you.
t1_duvotzd	1	*	Yeah its not really a tourism issue, the locals approach to pullution, littering and environment is horrific. Fixing these issues and establishing infrastructure should be where tourist dollars are reinvested.  
t1_duece4y	1	*	Like the FSB cant cook up fake passports
t1_dufm9gk	0	*	If you crash land somewhere the chances are good. A plane can crash land the weirdest places. But when you read about a disaster in a mountain range it's nearly always the pilot flying in foggy weather and not noticing where they are going. Such a diaster is flying straight on into a mountain. Some crashes where the plane falls out of the sky only leaves small debris lying around. So it will just look like leaves everywhere. Not even metal survives that.
t1_duuvx9m	1	*	> So... their right to freedom of choice is infringed upon.  My mum had to be sectioned after a psychological break. Her freedom of choice was infringed upon and I am eternally grateful to the people who did it because it is the only reason she is still around today.  Sometimes certain freedoms need to be suspended for individuals (suspended, not removed) for their own safety. Especially the mentally ill (which a large part of the homeless population is).
t1_dudbpdb	0	*	Intelligence services were trying to influence other countries since the dawn of time. The gentlemanly agreement so far was that your only pursue spies if you've caught them in your country. Sure US should be mad at Russia and never issue visas to these guys but criminal charges seem a bit off.

t1_durcfri	1	*	Had Japan surrendered it wouldn't have happened.  Had Japan not attacked the US it wouldn't have happened.  Had Japan not been siding with the Nazis it wouldn't have happened.  Japan should blame themselves for it.  Honestly, Japan does not view their own past anything like how Germany views the Nazis and that shows they haven't learned their lesson.

Look, I'm building that wall tall and strong! Guts social programs, kills the deficit, alienates allies, leaves voting systems vulnerable, acts like a spoiled 12-year-old bitch and is a cockholster for Putin.  Sorry, I was trying to keep it hypothetical.

t1_dugzyuo	1	*	I mean. The politicians love this and support this. So it's not like it's outside  influence. The politicians are basically asking for this money. Trump even asked the Russian to hack Hillary. So it's not a war against them. And these influences are not really bothersome for many politicians.

t1_dum76s8	1	*	> An interesting observation: in western media Duterte is corrupt, cruel and despotic. In Chinese media he is portrayed as a man doing the necessary evil for his country, promoting cooperation and rejecting western imperialism. I wonder how the locals see him.  Color me surprised that the Chinese leadership would paint him as that because they're totally not trying to consolidate power in their own backyard now that the TPP is dead and gone.

t1_dupibne	1	*	Problem is the investigation will be done by a party that is biased to ignore it/lie about it like they have done already. This is not unique to Israeli army, all armies in combat situation do this. There won't be a fair investigation so people aren't keen on waiting for something that will likely fabricate/distort truth to make the IDF appear blameless.

Completely missing the fact that actually, everyone knows this is a long process and we're just discussing a new piece of information.

t1_duho92n	1	*	It's funny that you mention partisan hatred. Trump is all about that. But you must be following these top U.S. officials advice, cause you seem to be ignoring the tweets.  No matter what you believe, Trump is an idiot and is an embarrassment to America. He does not conduct himself like a president should.   You must be able to see that regardless of your political party. Right?
t1_duhour9	1	*	If anyone is wondering, the guy wants to know how the Global Times (communist mouthpiece) will report this.  
t1_dunq7hj	0	*	because no one can afford living and developers only care about profits. There's million of starving people in Africa yet no flourishing food export industry to Africa.
t1_dul6jk3	1	*	It wouldn't be like that in Ireland. The only people who care about religion in that way are the elderly. Students will take religion is they are interested in it, but I imagine most will drop it if the alternative is decent.
t1_dug82o5	0	*	> Hopefully more will be done to prevent this number from rising.   Allowing Iran to buy new aircrafts and parts to do proper maintenance on their existing fleet would be a good start.  For Russia (or more largely the former Soviet Union), it's more complicated. I think they are proud to keep flying the aircrafts they were once able to build, even if they are now deathtraps.

t1_dukvjfk	1	*	Great, now you just got some poor incompetent spy executed
t1_dufcy3s	1	*	This is a woefully ignorant statement to make because you are ignoring that the US is an economic powerhouse and world economic leader and has the capacity to leverage large corporations by imposing tariffs on goods, resources, and products, thus encouraging the growth of domestic industries and increasing efficiency.   But instead tariffs are used to protect pet industries and key funders tied to the Republican party when it suits and benefits them politically and economically.

But then, since I dislike reflecting the ambitions of a few (Bush+Rumsfeld) on a whole nation (eg you Americans, you Russians), Id say its none of your fault, but mainly collusions between politicians and certain industries (Arbusto, Zapata Oil, big shareholder of HalliBurton) ..

t1_dunb5bl	1	*	I definetly agree. Same in some European countries where people have a strong feeling of  nationality. 
t1_duptrr7	1	*	You're an idiot. Increasing the number of workers in the system just makes it harder for Germans to get jobs and lowers their salary.  Adding workers only benefits an economy when there is no already firmly established society.  And no, Germany was not having serious problems with a lack of workers.

t1_dupqvf1	1	*	The Israeli military said troops fired towards the assailant and confronted him from close range after he allegedly ran towards them, armed with an iron rod. If they did beat him to death after he was wounded or used excessive force, they will be tried by the army. But if they just shot the guy or he died during a physical fight with them, then they didn't really do anything wrong. You can't charge soldiers with an iron rod and expect your death to be an unreasonable outcome.

I'm going to cut my beef consumption as well, more chicken it is

t1_dublkaz	1	*	The flipside of that is the problem that if there's something someone disagrees with (especially in scientific topics) they'll just scream shill and ignore reality too. The GMO/Monsanto shill argument comes up so often whenever I talk about GMOs, and I'm a university agriculture researcher of all things.

t1_dun2az7	0	*	[This book](http://www.amazon.com/Side-Parallel-Histories-Israel-Palestine/dp/1595586830) gives a good parallel primary on Israeli and Palestinian histories. It's really telling what each history omits. Both of them tell the truth. Just different truths and different sins of omission.  Won't get you much about Egypt, but it's probably necessary context.

t1_dujjljm	0	*	Am I so out of touch? No, it's the journalists who are wrong.
t1_dufcdyb	1	*	The reality is that the election was decided by a small number of votes in a few specific states so it is plausible that interference of this nature was enough to swing things one way or the other.   You could also argue that making trump win wasn't the longer term goal, perhaps the goal is to sow political division and polarise your society? That does weaken the worlds super power I suppose.

t1_duwbv5v	1	*	You can use Google Drive but much like if you want Johnny from down the street to deliver the pizza your ordered for free on his way home from work instead of paying the pizza place's $2 delivery fee you have to set all of it up yourself. You can't just call the pizza place and demand they set the whole thing up.  Of course, system backups and cloud storage are both a bit more complex than arranging a single pizza delivery

t1_ducs7zo	1	*	It said Russian bots, not paid by Russia. They could be used by anyone who wants to do this.    I guess since Twitter is an American website, this could still be done.     Next time, it will be American bots then, used by someone from Russia.     The internet is global after all.

t1_dunfwvd	0	*	You mean the continent that was under actual authoritarian rule for the majority of the 20th century?  Yeah, I dont think so.       The US remains the beacon for feeedom and democracy around the world.  Best example.  Only one Constitution since 1787, no one in Europe can boast that.  
t1_dudlli7	0	*	There is something very wrong with this article. China exports a lot of solar wafer to US but very little solar panels  EDIT: According to [this](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-22/trump-taxes-solar-imports-in-biggest-blow-to-clean-energy-yet) the solar panel imports consist of:  * 36% from Malaysia * 21% from Korea * 9% from Vietnam * 9% from Thailand * 8% from China  So maybe they should show the increase from all countries to give a more reasonable picture.
t1_dudlumn	1	*	A number of them
t1_duu9stu	0	*	It honestly says a lot about the American justice system that no one has charged these fools with anything major before. They're almost hilariously bad at being criminals. Did it really take becoming the most famous/person person in the world for light to be shed on this stuff?
t1_duqz0iu	1	*	Nah these are the lesser charges theyre getting in exchange for their cooperation in the investigation.  Like, if you get caught selling drugs, they may lessen your charges or sentence if you help them get the guy that sold them to you.

t1_duq907j	1	*	I think it has been pointed out before that other teams just have high number of asthmatics so they can use the drugs without penalty.
t1_duxacmb	0	*	They aren't wrong. They were not Polish sanctioned concentration camps. I know it seems silly but they were Nazi German (btw notice how we use that name plate NAZI Germany, not just German) death camps. The Polish themselves didn't exactly have much choice, seeing as how they were being occupied by a foreign power.  Now, I'm not in agreement, whats-so-ever, with this new law, it's a step in the very wrong and dangerous direction.
t1_dut3pia	1	*	I sometimes forget Mongolia is a country. How is life there?
t1_dudxa8c	1	*	When I first attended university, [Monster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_Beverage) would regularly park a blacked out lifted Chevy on campus and [pay employees to give away the entire bed](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/db/1c/9f/db1c9f2aa801ecbff496ab133348e259.jpg) full of drinks every day. They'd fill the damn bed with ice and drinks and just give them out to students all day long.

t1_dubrgeh	1	*	Ask yourself why the US policy had changed. Follow that and it will lead you to Russias changing policy/technology on nukes. The US policy is a direct response to Russia. 
t1_dusgyvm	1	*	You are kidding right?  Right now don the con is motivating them into buying their corn, rice and lentils from other markets, that will kill the US farm economy. If Canada can convince them to move to LPG and build a port, there goes the entire Texas economy.  Once moved the chances of the trade returning is slim to nil even after trump is long gone.

t1_duk9cmi	0	*	You can't, and you won't.
t1_dues7yo	1	*	I see this as North Korea leveraging the fact that they have already completed their nuclear program to a satisfactory level. They are now trying to re-enter the modern diplomatic and economic world. It's not like the world doesn't already let dictatorial regimes participate. See Saudi Arabia, China, Russia, etc. As long as they're useful or to hard to take down the world often welcomes countries who shit all over basic human rights.

t1_duqh3ig	1	*	Well, the FBI certainly thinks it's possible.
t1_duergaj	1	*	Its not exactly about protecting privacy and shit. Its about we have to start controlling social media ASAP after they saw how Russia fucked up UK with Brexit and USA with Trump.

t1_dufty3p	1	*	Life will never be completely safe. Never.
t1_duanyxb	1	*	Japans way more xenophobic than any European country. It would be like dealing with the UK on steroids.  What they care about is the trade.
t1_duvrs5w	0	*	Everyone knows about the threat of Islamic terror, but the right always tries to downplay the threat of far right terror.  It needs to be clear that it's not just people who align with ISIS that want to commit terrorist attacks, it's also the far right.
t1_duonxab	1	*	It's hard to see what's happening when you're in the midst of fog.
t1_dupams2	0	*	It also means their best minds are focused on developing technologies that are beneficial to the German economy, while the US's best minds are often focused on making better weapons.

t1_dussc3m	1	*	We are neighbors, we are not worth a conversation about forcing another country to pay for our infrastructure. And they obviously dont care, and they shouldnt 
t1_duoedsd	1	*	Putin systematically exterminated all serious opposition.  Opposition which are allowed to exist is safe for Putin. Putin uses it to control and monitor opposition movements, to let people vent their frustration, etc.

t1_duq8li8	1	*	How is that an argument? Define need?  I have yet to see a shady lobbying organization turn down money, needing it or not.

t1_dunlqlv	0	*	The hilarity there is more that they're willing to treat Tide Pods like a public health issue but not guns. Hilarity.. that's the one where you're very angry, right?
t1_dud85xt	1	*	Maybe he sent out a team to investigate and then read a report?  Maybe he had to make the hard decision between aid and child-rape, or mass starvation and disease. I certainly wouldn't want to make that decision.

t1_duvh8la	1	*	Do you have sources on this esp. about the bit with the military sources? I'm interested in this.

t1_dugj7w4	1	*	I mean I know we're looking for easy answers that put all the blame on Trump, but Russia started interfering after the US and specifically the Obama/Hillary administration played a massive role in helping topple the government of Russia's closest ally and economic partner. It wasn't just the administration though; establishment Republicans like McCain also pushed for it.   Trump was basically the logical choice. 
t1_dumothv	1	*	Yup. I mean we don't even treat our own species fairly. You think any other species had any chance?

t1_duu8xco	1	*	They were wrong back then already
t1_duhwa9k	0	*	It's very annoying when people do that. I once had a customer attendant in a shop who was being rude to me and I said as much. He says, Oh, I'm Puerto Rican! We're like that. I just walked out and was thinking to myself that that isn't helping with racism, is it? When dickheads go around using their ethnicity as an excuse for their behaviour.
t1_duw9zgi	1	*	Interpol arrests anyone a member nation puts out a request for. 
t1_duemnx0	1	*	Yes there will
t1_dua8ocx	1	*	They were fed lies for decades.  Essentially the Brittish government used the EU as a scapegoat for all its woes and bad policies.   A portion believed them and thus wanted to leave the EU. A portion realized they were lying and being cunts so they voted leave to spite them (as they were campaigning 'Remain'). 
t1_duu0pqt	1	*	Why would it do anything to the autism population?

t1_dui16m7	1	*	Thats just the limit of the record
t1_dul6jre	0	*	On a secondary school level in Ireland that is what it is. We studied Islam due the Junior cert cycle, much to a the annoyance of us as we thought it would be Catholicism and thus an CSPE style easy A.   On the leaving cycle it was just a filler class that most teachers, including the actually brothers who belonged to the religious order that ran the school,  gave as a free class for people to do homework/relax.   Except my teacher, who spend 6 months talking about euthanasia. 
t1_duph8q3	1	*	> To all the gun toting, war mongering people: Please go back to school  To learn from (possibly soon to be) gun toting war mongers?  The problem for places like that is baked into their culture and society at this point.
t1_dup7wfx	1	*	well, its not law law. international law is not law law. no international court no internatinal law 
t1_duyd2u2	1	*	I seem to recall a couple of stories where those state governments caught the Federal Government trying to hack into their systems.
t1_duf7v1r	1	*	Your username is super ironic lol

t1_duknlbk	1	*	The civil war started when his soldiers turned machine guns on peaceful protesters.
t1_duml730	0	*	Seems that the areas with armed security guards aren't experiencing shootings unlike these schools. Despite your sarcasm, the data shows it is obvious. Tell me how it would have gone if that football coach had a gun?

t1_dufzhuq	0	*	Your geography is incorrect. 
t1_duoexb0	1	*	Kinda joke, but true. One does not simply to say/do anything against our gov/church. Many people ended up in jail. 
t1_duutvp2	1	*	Yea like legalizing drugs.  Legalizing homelessness would also help. By giving welfare support,  homeless people will get a chance to rebuild themselves and become more independent. For drugaddicts,  we support them until they are fully indpenendt from the claws of addiction. 
t1_duxbn1z	1	*	Exactly, their abuse of the offensive speech law to punish political activists is a great example of why things need to be crystal clear before theyre codified in law and given to biased enforcers.  Any wiggle room is always taken advantage of to the extreme.
t1_duzbmsk	1	*	Actually...Civ Ghandi is basically bizarro Ghandi and Trump certainly qualifies as bizarro Ghandi so, in a way...it would be Ghandi.

t1_dutbjch	1	*	If you consider that the Kremlin wants higher tensions between North Korea and the west, and has done so many things to prop them up, this makes sense. Instead of dismissing it outwardly why don't you consider the possibility of it in the grand scheme of things ? Or is this not myopic enough for your world view ? 
t1_dupagep	0	*	Mostly purchased legally.
t1_duti1xk	1	*	Understand this clearly, there has never been a circumstance where the US has ever done anything more than completely fuck-up.   Mexico doesn't want your help except maybe to stop enabling the shipment of illegal guns into Mexico. BTW, Canada would like the same thing.

t1_dud44bf	0	*	Same thing with /r/politics that sub needs to be closely monitored and censored by reddit in case any opinions stray to far from their bias.
t1_dunqoh7	1	*	I think rampant consumerism helps the process. We keep feeding money into corporations who use the capital to buy politicians' votes on matters that empower the corporations at the expense of us. It's like most governments are in a state of hostile takeover.
t1_duqlk1v	1	*	I see the Russian bots are downvoting me.
t1_dufntt9	0	*	We Israelis would rather our PM and the toddler bunch he calls his ministers would stop to:   A. take credit for the IDF's work for protecting Israel after repeatedly calling the chief of armed forces 'a failure' and 'crypto leftist' just because he won't allow Israeli soldiers to take international law to their own hands.  B. provoke and incite needlessly making an embarrassing spectacle of himself in international summits.    
t1_duvz48n	1	*	>On the northern tip of Greenland, the Cape Morris Jesup meteorological site has had a record-smashing 61 hours of temperatures above freezing so far in 2018  The article is literally saying but it was warm in Greenland!

t1_dutdrol	1	*	Washington Edison Prado must be good at being stealthy to maintain such a low profile to avoid notice by a global audience of millions of Wikipedia editors. After he is arraigned in a U.S. federal court in Florida, I suspect his presence and name might become more noticeable in the media, possibly in Wikipedia.
t1_duhixtq	1	*	Planets come and go, its the way of the universe. -Astronomy student 
t1_dur640o	1	*	Sometimes people stay home even when they ought to leave. All sorts of reasons. First, it's their home and they feel connected to it. I know people who have turned down better jobs in richer countries because they couldn't bring their whole family with them. There's also idealism.  I would guess that your Canadian company makes a good job of screening professionals and anyone they hire will be top notch; but that doesn't mean that all the ones who stay behind are incompetent.
t1_duswrx2	1	*	undoubtedly that can factor into the analysis and calculation, but there is a bit of me wondering how much damage they've done to their programme in the aftermath of this much reported (and disputed) testing mountain that they're supposed to have all but blown up?  They haven't conducted any tests since, and seem to have been striking a more conciliatory or diversionary posture. Is it possible that they have indeed set their programme back a lot further than we realise

t1_duw76po	1	*	It's not that they don't want to help. They actively want it to get worse. Remember dominionists? Rapture believers? The Prosperity-Gospel? Religion down there says you HAVE to help those fat cats fuck the planet up as fast as possible because only once the planet's turned into a new hell will jesus make sure all the non-born-again get left behind.

t1_dusq0rx	1	*	The bikeslook sturdy enough in the photo, guess appearances aren't everything.       This company is incredibly naive though. It only takes one asshole to steal a bike out of thousands of customers. As a Dutchman I don't park my bike anywhere without sufficiently locking it first. Even then bike thefts are so common in big cities it's almost a running joke.
t1_duawaem	1	*	Because it isn't mentioned *every day*, everyone has lost interest in them? This clearly shows that those who can do something about them have *not* lost interest.
t1_dua4xwm	1	*	They're just averaging it out to a time period because that's what they were told to do in clickbait class.   Honestly, between several million 12-18 year olds, one of them trying to kill someone every few days isn't very surprising... The biggest thing is that a lot of these shootings aren't full on Virginia tech or Columbine shooting sprees, they're just your average targeted murder or gang bullshit.
t1_dup5nq8	1	*	People mostly are passive about politics. Some protest, but they are not many. Those who remember 90s don't trust anyone but there are some consensus that Putin is lesser evil. Maybe younger generation will shift things. They don't remember hardships from 90s so they won't easily agree to corruption bullshit.

t1_duphz3f	1	*	Sounds just like the US right. Didnt we just increase military spending because we needed to be sure our troops had the things they need that they dont have today?
t1_dum9ke2	1	*	it's been raid. NK has no intention of going for the diplomacy route as they know they WON'T deliver. They have cheated in the past and WILL cheat again. They has been playing friend and foe with CHINA, RUSSIA/Sovier Union, US, and SK. Currently, it seems sanctions are working as they are trying to soft them up by bringing the players to the table.
t1_dui8wum	0	*	In what capacity? The only real impacts would be negotiating drug/medical equipment costs and military costs.
t1_durl3pn	1	*	The problem isnt that the survivors of the only nuclear weapon use ever are talking about how amazingly hellish those weapons were. The problem is that the Japanese government & education system are not perceived as having owned the atrocities they committed. 
t1_dul78sd	0	*	What do I do with my mourning wood then?
t1_duwh18d	1	*	Solar, wind, hydro, planting more trees, etc etc
t1_dugfrtc	0	*	The Donald is known for taking criticism and instruction well. Im sure the problem is no one has mentioned it to him. 
t1_duqwefg	1	*	Because the sanction details aren't classified information.  I don't think relatives of the president should really get involved with international affairs, however it's not like she revealed top secret classified information
t1_duwjnmr	1	*	Sort of. Traffic is very complex, after all. Sometimes reducing the speed limit actually improves traffic flow (and thereby reduces emissions as there's less time spent per vehicle in traffic)
t1_duxwpv3	1	*	great!  can't wait for their next preggi porno!
t1_dufvecy	0	*	That doesn't seem like a very diplomatic way of asking someone to cooperate with you.
t1_dutubqk	0	*	Can't say I didn't see that coming since there was no successor in line yet.
t1_duk9kkt	0	*	Good, this is how it should be regardless of who is president. People should take responsibility for what they believe in themselves rather than pushing it onto others through government.
t1_dumoq9e	1	*	Casual racism aside, you realize they can come to the U.S. or Europe and get a much, much, MUCH better education and experience than they could've gotten in their home country and use that knowledge and take it back to their home country in a positive way, correct? It's not like international education is a new concept.
t1_ducp4cj	1	*	But lobbying is legal
t1_dur5wu6	0	*	Isn't this mild charchter assasination? This things supports something bad so what is saying must be false.  it's sound a lot like ad hominem to me.
t1_durg2jt	0	*	This  They're still not admitting the atrocities they did in China during that period.  I studied university in China, many of my classmates were Japanese. We did a uni trip to NanJing, went to the museum, My classmates were in tears because they never knew the hideous shit the Japanese of that generation did in China then.  I'm not condoning nukes, but until Japan stand up and take accountability for their shit like Germany have done, they really should just shut the f up.
t1_dutqdrz	1	*	Is there even a correlation between vacinnes and autism?  I just presumed it was an American rumour. Never heard it in the UK before.

t1_dug5ay7	1	*	I'm guessing they've thought of that, probably got a fingerprint database.
t1_dutkald	1	*	If Navalny was an actual puppet Putin wouldn't stop him from running, what would be the point? I think Putin simply thinks the risk of killing him outweighs the benefit since he's not enough of a threat atm and another murder would be so blatant that it could turn more of the population against Putin.
t1_dupwa2r	1	*	There are agents of change in Saudi Arabia. The problem is , of you change too fast, there will be a backlash, maybe civil war. It's easy to sit back and laugh at their lack of progress but it ignores the realities on the ground.
t1_dux4v0n	0	*	Why would apple stay in Ireland if Ireland leaves the EU? The reason apple is there in the first place is because they can sell to the enitre EU from there while paying absurdly low corporate tax.
t1_duy981h	1	*	Fuck why would we want sanctions?? No thanks. But political pressure would be appreciated for once. 
t1_duqfhqz	1	*	Sounds like you are talking about the US.
t1_dubmmfj	0	*	why not keep bitcoins on a flashdrive?
t1_duir84q	1	*	No, religions have developed over the centuries, there is no reason to stop now, moderate religious leaders should develop a symbolic ritual if they feel one is needed. These religions would still exist, so not a ban or anti-semitic, just entirely in line with the values we purport to have in a modern society. They won't change outdated practices voluntarily if not prodded to.
t1_duux7so	1	*	We are in need of a culling so its really OK
t1_dut5ca3	1	*	You should start a subreddit.
t1_dusilwn	1	*	Not pathetic at all, a good portion of conservatives believe in the fuck trump message.  its just that the fringe are under the delusion that being anti-trump makes you a liberal
t1_dusz4eg	1	*	Oh thats gonna hurt their credit score
t1_dusyvf8	0	*	Are you typing on your horse?
t1_due9im0	0	*	I mean its not just because its known that it prevents many types of infections
t1_duac5bh	1	*	Still an idiotic position for a supposedly unbiased and neutral organization to have.
t1_dur0kn5	1	*	At this rate, every Trump staffer is going to be a former. His administration has a higher turnover rate than a McDonalds staffed by teenagers. 
t1_dudr1w0	1	*	I am retired now but I have been in business for 20 years and I never ever made a profit. If I did, I gave it to my accountant and he took care of it.
t1_duvfw9v	1	*	AWS calls it the shared security model.     TL:DR; You encrypt your shit, and we'll make sure to keep the doors locked, properly dispose of hard drives, and that Jimbo down the street can't wardrive our data centers.
t1_duhbgqt	0	*	Wouldn't the best case scenario be that the President wasn't colluding with Russia and that the investigation shows this to be true?  Or are we approaching this as a team game thing?
t1_duih88k	1	*	A very rice boy
t1_duyswqe	1	*	After the week we just had how can you say it's nothing
t1_duu2rp2	1	*	He actually threatened to sue and was met with incredulity by the press.

t1_dumj64c	1	*	this is the right answer
t1_dutoqn8	1	*	Yep it's gone. I don't know what happened to it.
t1_duf26jd	0	*	Much smarter than that.  Also divide Democrats by making Bernie Dems hate Hilary so that they will vote for Stein or abstain in the election.  Stein got 50k votes in one state where Trump only beat Hilary by 12k votes. So, the Russian bots were very successful.
t1_duraa8p	1	*	I know a lot of other countries rip on america regularly. I just hope they dont think what the government does represents what the people want. I try to think that way about Russia...
t1_duwidf5	0	*	>The ease with which people are labeled terrorists in for instance the US  Care to expand what you mean? Being labelled as and being convicted as a terrorist are very different things.
t1_duc9tsy	1	*	The states arent the leading party of those cases, read the headline
t1_dur0e55	0	*	- trillion dollars +
t1_dur6lfz	1	*	Can't see the situation improving with Maduro still in power, seeing as he hasn't done anything to fix his country. Worst case scenario is that the US forces are deployed to maintain stability, but I find it very unlikely. The change has to come from the citizens of Venezuela, but as other redditors have already said, a hungry populace is too weak to revolt.  There aren't a lot of cards left on the table, and none of them are pretty.
t1_dulrelu	0	*	Trust me, in the government every company vastly over charges them. Do they stop to think hmm, 40000 dollars is a bit much for this rather simple item? Nah, they just pay it.
t1_dui8vyz	1	*	He'd also be one president I'd actually love voting for.
t1_duf29e7	1	*	It's reddit.  The same idiots who tell you that Russia alone completely decided the outcome of tje election.  If it's really possible for someone to change the outcome of an election by writing some fake posts on Facebook I would definitely check the sanity of the people there.
t1_duj1j5j	0	*	Man, I get what youre saying here. But if you joked that having black roommates would teach you to freestyle and improve your jump-shot, would that sound good?   Which isnt to say you cant have gay roommates who are neat freaks or black roommates who play basketball. Just that you shouldnt suggest that their sexual preference or race is responsible for their hobbies or personalities. 
t1_duhk08t	1	*	The best thing you can personally do is vote for someone who doesnt deny it is happening. 
t1_dugsidk	1	*	I had to re-sub here just to find a thread about this.  Still looking for the tweets.  Not going to twitter for them.
t1_dubk1nk	0	*	did you know 30 million people in china live in caves
t1_dubw861	1	*	First time seeing it for me. Youre just on Reddit too much
t1_dudct28	1	*	This proves the investigation dates back to a year *before* before Trump announced.  Evidence was gathered starting in 2014, Trump announced in 2015.  Which means the deep-state witch-hunt thing is a lie.  Do you not understand how this just fucked over a year of your narrative?
t1_duhlofh	1	*	Because capitalism allows companies to increase prices on their products, and governments and politicians get lots of money from drug companies
t1_dukdddm	1	*	That style of management is the reason that so many businesses get CH11'ed these days.
t1_duj911g	0	*	>FYI when people don't come vote it is supposedly good for Putin (easier to rig votes), so quit your bullshit.  We are now at the stage where whether people will come or not makes no difference. The other candidates are figureheads to give an illusion of real election, and the only guy who has some agenda and can be counted as a real political force (Alexey Navalny) is banned.
t1_dubye5g	1	*	did you even read the article? they said that hunting is the bigger issue than deforestation, although that also plays a role of course. 
t1_dupjoi3	0	*	Fuck man it's 10AM and I'm on my 3rd beer:(
t1_duqlb20	1	*	Wartime is the only time those carry the death penalty.
t1_dusk9xl	1	*	That's not the point of this. The point of this is to horrify people even more of Nuclear weapons further discouraging their use, especially in the current geopolitical situation.    Also, History. 
t1_duihyjr	1	*	The poll was made from a german newspaper that doesnt reflect the whole german society since only the lower end of people in terms of education, reads it. So no surprise that they found a bigger percentage in a populist right winged Party. It doesnt show how an actual vote would turn out and it hasnt much to do with the policy of the AFD, only with the incompetence of finding a new government.
t1_dudy20s	1	*	Ivana got something like $25 million from Trump when they divorced.  He has the best prenups.
t1_dud1gfr	0	*	Her water broke 36 hours before delivery!? Its great that the baby was well and all but you did put them at risk of a serious infection. Maybe youre happy to take that risk with a childs life but a lot of people wouldnt be. Its easy to say medical intervention is unnecessary  when you got lucky... Also your wife bled because the placenta wouldnt detach, not because the doctor was tugging on the cord... Source: am a Paediatric doc 
t1_dueshn1	1	*	But we can create our own money can't we? Who do we owe $20 trillion to? Ourselves??? 
t1_dukot24	1	*	lol this dude thinks it's wading in 
t1_dujrcjb	1	*	This speaks to Trump's techniques for retcon and gaslighting. The intent of his message changes as the situation requires. His current beliefs are all the truth he needs.
t1_duniqqu	0	*	Eh, he hasn't really had that many supporters in first place. I think the majority of population is simply unconvinced that any of the opposition is better than Putin's party. And we don't know any better, while things aren't that bad at the moment. I am pretty confident, however, that if things actually got worse, the bubble would burst and it would not be pretty. 
t1_dulngs6	0	*	>Pence is absolutely correct here  His petty insults are absolutely correct? Then why did he schedule a meeting and get upset when it's canceled if he's 'taking a stand'.   You don't get to take a stand during a moment where just simple things like shaking hands could have major diplomatic impact, and then cry about having a meeting canceled. He's either taking a stand or he isn't. In this case he's trying to do both.
t1_dutv9ul	1	*	I really can't see a good future for Hong Kong under CPC, wish you all the best and make sure to prepare for the worst. Take care.

t1_dubank4	1	*	American here, please disregard this. US/Eng media is corrupt as are both parties of our govt. Somehow everyone is caught up in this us vs them thing, when russians put their pants on one leg at a time just like we do. Some folks here think its Russias fault that we allowed our govt to fuck us and the whole world. Its very sad. Maybe one of these days we can all figure out how to be friends again and together flush the corruption worldwide. 
t1_dusu1a3	1	*	So is every American president ever lol

t1_dut9di4	1	*	Anti Vax lunatic alert!
t1_duyijo1	0	*	No election coming and, please, take a visit to some parts of germany if you don't believe it. There are areas where the normal german citizen isn't safe/wanted/accepted anymore. And the crime rates in this districts speak for thenselves.

t1_dupnx4r	1	*	Double it in bitcoin

t1_duj0sys	1	*	Are you surprised? Hell I wouldnt be surprised if I saw similar shit crop up during US elections later this year, especially local elections in red states. We know the Russians are giving us election help after all...
t1_duquz4u	0	*	Yep! here in the philippines it is being used as a political issue which is kinda sad. people are now afraid to have vaccinations especially those who are not well educated.

t1_duss899	0	*	Worse than holding secret meetings with the Russians? Worse than passing a fucked up tax plan? Worse than appointing a dick head that killed net neutrality? Trump might not be worse but he's sure close

t1_duw44f1	1	*	thats like asking what would kill you first if you were you on fire and you jumped out of a plane and into the ocean.  worry more about what happens in the next year.
t1_dubq9wf	1	*	Since they're bots, can't they just program them to be not Russian?
t1_dui44nk	1	*	Such is our news system.
t1_dups1tx	1	*	I think even terms like right wing or conservative are so different in usage between the US and everywhere else in the world that trying to compare is a hopeless task.  
t1_dupgu1b	1	*	is anyone making the USA invest billions more than necessary into the military other than politicians here at home?  if Germany starts spending more, do people really think that the US would cut military spending under a Republican government regardless? no, they'll keep on about meaningless, metric-less concepts like readiness.

t1_dubxa0m	1	*	Donde esta Las sanctions?
t1_duunl7h	1	*	Yes, watching global seismicity for a year or more really puts the impactful earthquakes in context. There are so many earthquakes but we generally only hear about the ones that disrupt people. I like watching [this video of the 2011 earthquake](https://youtu.be/oSSqaVJz4gc); the aftershock sequence from Japan's M9 just won't quit.

t1_duhszws	1	*	....nice try, Vladimir!
t1_duqdxhr	1	*	Couldn't possibly be that he flippantly threatens things like nuclear war. ^(/s)    On the other hand it would make for some awkward pillow talk with Putin. 
t1_duyf7t8	1	*	It depends on how big her wallet really is.  And if the Junta wants to make an example  Egyptian prison, medieval dungeon, US facility on Cuba ... pick your favorite holiday destination then.  Your president has issued a name for certain countries recently ...  
t1_dulv4tc	1	*	How is he a threat to their democracy? AFAIK he didn't unlawfully take control of the government. And as another user pointed out he's following through on what he said he'd do if elected...it's wrong and makes him a scummy human being but when people say threat to democracy they don't actually know what they're saying.  
t1_duh3b53	1	*	This is a money laundering thing from years before it's not even related to the election in fact that's the legal defense that the warrant didn't cover the documents that prove him guilty because they had nothing to do with the election.
t1_dusu03z	0	*	Its a journalism term
t1_dum5fpf	1	*	I visited my girlfriend's family in Manila last year, and while it's obviously only a small sample, her whole family talked shit on Trump AND Duterte the whole time
t1_dujoi0m	1	*	Are you talking about the author for the article?
t1_duj3jci	1	*	Also Canadian, can confirm. No opt in checkbox found on census or tax forms.
t1_dui8j1t	1	*	I want to argue that this is fighting corruption with a different kind of corruption.. To BUY a reasonable government shouldn't be in anyone's ability to do.. But then I see how twisted the system is to feed itself and fight off changes that I kind of have to agree the only way to beat the system would be to first own it then fold it into what you wanted it to be.. Hopefully with failsafe to keep it actually functioning intelegently. 
t1_dute1dv	1	*	Hehe current trend
t1_dumjl3e	1	*	This..I was looking for this
t1_dueyh2b	1	*	My favourite part as well.
t1_dunx5wq	1	*	Welcome to Africa, we are the shithole countries where fastfood chains still use styrofoam
t1_duvd3wm	0	*	No one have won in Syria. This is not over.   And Russian soldiers and equipment is way inferior to US. You may get away will killing Syrian children and Ukrainian boys, but Russians die if they meet real soldiers. Remember Finland.
t1_duvvzlg	1	*	The daft thing is this eliminates the one good thing about the Chinese system. It'll be all down hill from here. Keeping around one good leader will not offset the losses from when the long term bad leaders start piling up.
t1_durh592	1	*	Don't worry I'm sure there will be a bunch of articles about how none of this is happening and its made up by nazis/russia/islamophobes etc
t1_duosqey	0	*	He could live in russia for the rest of his life
t1_dus8nvm	1	*	T-50,  SU 57,  Chevy Cavalier, Cadillac Cimmaron, Buick Skylark, Olds Omega. Just assign a different name and confuse people into believing you have a decent vehicle.
t1_dup40qs	1	*	Well I imagine they're a bit miffed now that it's come out that the Dutch have been watching their hackers very, *very* closely.
t1_duyuog3	0	*	The amount of Americans who dont understand the difference between being forced to do something and choosing something for yourself...its amazing.   For many American Muslims like myself, the choice to wear a hijab is empowering because were harassed for wearing them. Doing what you want regardless of what others want to push on you is empowering.  In Iran, theyre being forced so choosing not to wear them is empowering.  See the difference there?
t1_dunpve6	1	*	You're right, the line of thinking you described is sectarian in nature and halts useful discussion a lot of the time.
t1_dut4t4o	1	*	If Trump were younger and not a stupid lazy shit hed try the same thing.
t1_dupzg03	0	*	I don't see how a 2017 flood is failing to account for climate change  Sounds like they just didn't make it flood proof
t1_duesapi	1	*	The US should stay out of other countries elections but when they do get involved its usually to prevent very bad people from gaining power and in the best interest of the people of that country. What Russia is doing is not just trying to throw an election, it is trying to throw Democracy. 
t1_duynoaq	1	*	Almost as much as the President loves yellow-showers!
t1_duftxve	1	*	Ok?

t1_duipvkz	0	*	You have a thirsty neighbor down south who can use all the water you can provide. 
t1_duve0xa	1	*	No real farmer takes the time to pick and save seeds!  A home gardener, yes, but not anybody that produces decent volumes.  Its a lot cheaper and easier to order a sack or a truckload of good seed and know what you have.  They are only beholden because the companies make a GOOD product that works year after year.  And Monsanto has never sued anybody either.
t1_duzh2pg	1	*	Hardly surprising with 2-strokes since you literally add oil to the fuel to be burnt. I don't see any figures for 4-strokes on that article though?  Given the rather high economy of a 4 stroke small engine bike / scooter (my CBF 125 used to get 130mpg ish) and the fact that they spend less time stuck in traffic queues, I'd be surprised if they were more polluting for single person journeys than that same single person driving a car. 
t1_duthnp2	1	*	Or crippled.
t1_dup2vmi	1	*	Sarcasitaball man....
t1_duhkkk7	1	*	People aren't stupid. If they don't see you being serious, they won't take you seriously ... regardless what a sycophant like Spicer says.  It's kind of like the aggressive language from North Korea is already priced in and nobody really takes them seriously when they talk about destroying their enemies.
t1_ducqgdr	1	*	Yes! They are everywhere..they are messing with our democracy
t1_duiykja	1	*	I mean... it wouldn't surprise me at this point.

t1_duylmnu	0	*	Nothing can be good or bad without a human to experience and report it. I fucking loathe the people like you who keep getting upvoted for saying that A) we dug our hole B) the planet is better without us.  Sure the situation is alarming, and maybe nothing can be done in time. But for the love of god stop saying that humanity as a whole is the problem.

t1_dudv1aw	1	*	> Soo ridiculous, its like that price was created to never be paid I dont get it..  That's exactly what happens in medicine.  All the insurance companies want discounts. So if the manufacturer really wants to sell for $100, but the average insurance company demands a 75% discount, the manufacturer has to price the thing at $400.  In the end, the only people who pay full price for anything medical are the uninsured.

t1_dunnc6a	0	*	Are you referring to Omega-3 fats? They're not the same. Flax seeds only contain ALA. Fish fats contain EPA and DHA. However, using tuna as a primary source of complex Omega-3's is absurd. Most fish oil supplements are from sardines and mackerel.

t1_dufqcum	0	*	More than that.  >  Instagram apparently bowed to a court order to block access to posts that embarrassed an oligarch and a top government official.  It's not a private person asking Instagram to remove the pics. There was a proper legal procedure.

t1_duhxdc4	0	*	Record precipitation in what is essentially a desert is not something to be cheering. The reason the ice sheet is growing in places is because weather patterns have shifted. Because of climate change. Almost like the issue is more than total ice volume (dun-dun-DUN!!)

t1_dutl81m	1	*	It was a sad day when I first heard about Danish mothers who felt they knew what was better for their kid than medical professionals, all because of some feel-good lecture they had with another mother.  Fuck these self-proclaimed experts who spread ignorance. I don't care what form they take they are scum.
t1_duxfe3p	1	*	Caipirinhas in this case 
t1_duqjp0p	1	*	To be fair, at this point I doubt Russia is doing doping, this would be utterly stupid.  To me, a more plausible explanation is that politically influenced doping-testing team fabricates false evidence, or someone puts doping in athletes' food to discredit Russia.  Or, alternatively, Russia does that to discredit the Olympic committee (for Russian media) framing them as manipulating tests...  Go on, downvote!
t1_duebtq8	1	*	Sheltered idiot
t1_duaetfi	1	*	Japan are hypocritical here. They are so racist the prefer to have a stagnating economy for the last 30 years rather than allow immigration.

t1_dujeilp	0	*	Iran ain't no north Korea and Israel isn't America.    Iran spends 3% and Israel 6% of their GDP on their military, that's   12,3 billion dollar versus 17,8 billion dollar. Iran has three times the active personnel, four times the reserve personnel and ten times citizens available for the military.    Israel military might be stronger, but it won't be a cakewalk. Especially considering how Iran counts half of the neighbors of Israel as allies.

t1_dur3t7w	0	*	Then the propaganda worked. What if a couple American soldiers died under muddled circumstances, and then RT released a 'recorded' *aftermath* of some grunts saying damn America sucks, this is the power of the big Russian cock. 
t1_dule3wl	1	*	You say that but when I did Religious education it was 1 week on Judaism and around 1 week on Islam with the rest focused near exclusively on Catholicism. This was across 6 years in secondary school and Sixth form. From what I've gathered this is relatively common.

t1_duzb1l1	0	*	Not saying that having elections is bad or anything.  But for about 1/4 of the time, USA government sort of just stops and everybody is paying attention to a political cage fighting.   3/4 of the other time, you have both parties slinging shit at each other.
t1_duprwsc	0	*	Bbbb but but THEIR ROBUST SOCIAL SAFETY NET IS SOCIALIST WASTE, or something. 
t1_dui83rl	1	*	Exactly.   Thats the problem with all of this. At least Gates clearly said billionaires instead of top earners or the wealthy.   It always comes down though and ends up hurting the small business owners, doctors, lawyers, etc.

t1_duybv15	0	*	> Clinton had a 4-way lead on the RCP average of 6.5% going into polling day, yet Trump carried the state by 0.7%. A miss of 7.2% is big. No pollster had Trump winning Wisconsin. That's the only one I think that would have a bit of a red light flashing for me  Every pollster had trump losing to clinton and yet he won ?  Pollsters were shit.

t1_dusi41f	1	*	> Most Americans are aware that America First is hate-speech no different than white power!  LOL
t1_duyb7r3	1	*	Well noticed. The Economist, whose journalists don't even print their names next to their articles, has been propagandising a rich man's version of economics for centuries.   Apparently it's wrong for the Russian government to brainwash us, but fine for rich, unelected, democratically unaccountable billionaires.

t1_duux33v	1	*	It is not about consuming drugs, but more about the illegal market. To me, the state should allow and sell drugs.
t1_ducpnac	1	*	Lol, give it up already.  Trump collusion is a nothingburger.
t1_dud9idb	1	*	Can I try? These brave men have purposely gotten themselves indicted. They have the irrefutable proof to put away Hillary and Podesta for pizzagate, but in order to get an audience with the corrupt FBI under oath they had to create a breadcrumb trail leading to their own indictment.   I cant take credit for that, I read a version of this (but about Flynn) on T_d. 
t1_duecm41	0	*	Just because a country has an extradition treaty with the US doesn't mean they'll hand over every suspect/fugitive they find. Roman Polanski is still living quite comfortably in France.
t1_duk27zy	1	*	I also had to cohabit with a gay man in college.  It was awful when he'd introduce me to his girlfriends that just needs some dick.  Terrible I tell you.  He nearly forced me to have no strings attached sex with multiple beautiful women.   
t1_dukimt0	1	*	I think this a good example of what Chappelle theorizes will cause major positive change - much like the case of Emmett Till. While it was senseless and sad in its own right, the reaction to it caused a major shift in the conditions of the time
t1_dubgdzf	0	*	I mean, it seems to me that for most topics (not focusing only on this one), the answer is: Do you agree with what the responses to you are saying? If no, it's a Russian bot.  Edit: Russian bots seem to dislike my answer =D

t1_dugxdfy	1	*	The Nixon administration was brought down largely thanks to an unnamed source who was known by the name of a porno.

t1_dud939i	1	*	Problem is Watergate only really got moving when the investigation found out about the tapes. I'm not sure if this will ever have 'tapes' that prove the connection. The right-wing press can continue to frame doubt in the minds of the public until there is. 
t1_dui22ft	1	*	I was just looking for this. Everything I've found has some crappy music playing, or someone trying to be smarter than me talking. I just want to have this up on a monitor and watch it.
t1_dud5l9r	1	*	Mueller indicted 13 Bernie Bros.  /s
t1_duqq44a	1	*	And the guy who said if I had done a tenth of what she did, I'd be in prison is going to prison.
t1_duot4xo	0	*	That could be said about any particular group, some are smarter than others, like those who don't judge an entire segment of a population based on the actions of a few. 
t1_duojzdt	1	*	It's safe to assume this means he won't be testifying against Manafort. Whether or not that's because he refused or they don't need his testimony isn't clear.  
t1_duunhmr	1	*	I know right? Its just doom and gloom here in this subreddit and its just painful too look at sometimes. Still the truth hurts.
t1_duyvkzo	0	*	I know edgy humour is the thing to be seen doing on Reddit, but if you actually read the article (I know, I know, *not* the done thing) you'll see that Pepsi are a part of this as well.
t1_duu66w7	1	*	Hong Kong is British clay!

t1_dupalyb	0	*	Took me 7 years to graduate in engineering due to 3 years of remedial math I needed so I could take Calculus I. Thanks Americas Public Scool System for preparing me for college!!! ... said no one ever. Last time I checked high school was a babysitting service and now apparently a battlefield.  I do think STEM is on the rise and private organizations have helped immensely trying to expose and inform kids about how to prep for it for college. In my days I had zero guidance and everyone hated math.
t1_dua4g9u	0	*	How's that plaque going for you? 
t1_duc3xte	1	*	[Yes](http://www.aina.org/news/20150410044601.htm).
t1_duaqiu1	1	*	There was a Detective Conan episode where a guy suspected his neighbor had killed someone (his relative?) and buried her on his property. So he robbed a jewelry store and then buried all the jewels all over the guy's yard so the police would have to dig it up. Spoiler alert, she wasn't in there. And frankly, shoving some emeralds into the soil won't get a body dug up if it's 6 feet under. But whatever.
t1_dulaiag	1	*	No syrias bf
t1_duqx00r	1	*	Yeah, we should probably support the only state in the Middle East where atheism is legal and socially tolerated. Which is Israel.
t1_duqp8gk	1	*	I recommend changing you name and asking again
t1_dui2whb	1	*	It should be noted, the offender posed as a female artist seeking nudes as models. Artists commonly sketch and draw the nude form. And so some people responded with photos. He then blackmailed those people with the nudes they sent. 
t1_dups9pi	1	*	They can either buy new chairs or a new photocopier.
t1_durw8s7	1	*	But if that country was China, Russia, Iran...

t1_duhn03l	0	*	Why is this downvoted? China is known to fish illegally all over the damn world, they have destroyed local ecosystems FFS. This news is great but seriously people, how can skepticism be downvoted like this? China has been upping their PR campaign, lets wait and see how they actually perform. 
t1_dun8oqj	1	*	They should do an annual 12hour period during which all criminal activity is legal

t1_dubtxt9	1	*	Chyena
t1_duqhml9	0	*	To piggyback on your great chemical comment with a biochemical one, the treatment for acute methanol poisoning as weird as it sounds is administration of ethanol as the enzyme that oxidises both is alcohol dehydrogenase. The higher the ratio of ethanol:methanol is the less methanol will be oxidised to the dangerous compounds formaldehyde and formic acid.
t1_due935f	0	*	Yep this.  Until this happens it's all PR bullshit.

t1_duf0pxr	0	*	I say we give earthquakes to everyone to defend themselves from earthquakes. 
t1_duz9d61	1	*	The reason its not simple to change back, is that plastic wrapping is all business.  It can make their product, that they spent money and time to grow, last maybe 3x long, more or less depending on the product.  To a business its a small investment to keep their product on the shelf for longer.

t1_dup9mpt	1	*	He's not released for good, he is now facing charges for organizing illegal protests that include a 30-day prison sentence. A period which just happens to include the Presidential election.   His campaign chief, who is not quite so famous, is still detained. 
t1_dubpf3i	1	*	Ya it's called r/politics. People don't realize the mass bottling on Reddit came AFTER the election, it's all anti trump bots now it's sad 
t1_dund9ud	1	*	We don't know yet, orange alert for now. People asked to stay home
t1_duripq5	1	*	They more I think on it the more I realize the only way to gather vast amounts of wealth is to be the very thing you described. You can not hoard while being empathetic.
t1_dur9kx4	1	*	There are a few organizations that receive help. I'm Venezuelan and I mail food to my family, but that goes to my parents house directly. I know that there are some activists organizations that receive help, mostly kids and baby food, which is really really scarce right now.
t1_duy90ni	1	*	No evidence of using sarin, Mattis said they did use chlorine gas, which is referred to directly in the linked article.

t1_duxoepj	1	*	> Why are they so afraid of their own people?   Because there's 1.3 billion of them. One of the biggest leverages the Chinese people have against their government is their population size. If the government does something that *really* pisses a large enough group off, it's over. 
t1_dusf5tv	1	*	Yeah. It wasnt even a year ago with 10 people died from heat stroke inside of one of these trailers in San Antonio.

t1_dup9cn3	1	*	> a homogeneous population  lol, I love how racism is normal in the US. Europe is actually far less homogeneous than the US. I mean the fact alone that there are so many different languages make this obvious. But Americans think that their population isn't homogeneous because people have different skin colors.

t1_dusr6sr	0	*	So just wondering do you know how the American revolution even started?    Your argument, especially in historical contexes is fallacious and inaccurate.   While the development of a professional army won america the war. It was the militias that even gave this country a fighting chance against  the #1 military at the time.

t1_duuzvcr	0	*	A lack of convictions doesn't necessarily mean a lack of rapes. Rape is very hard to convict for. It often happens in private with no witnesses, victims often don't come forward until evidence has degraded etc.  But I agree that this isn't necessarily migrants either. I mean why would there be such a sudden increase this year in particular? Migrants have been coming for years now.

t1_dultfy6	1	*	Maybe.  Maybe not.  I knew someone who'd been drinking that length of time (and had actually stopped drinking) when the dementia showed up.  Went downhill fast.  A year after his children finally moved him up to where they are they had to put him in a dementia facility.  Thing is, he got it early like in the article. He's otherwise healthy. Even his liver isn't causing him problems.  So he'll spend the next 15, 20, 25 years in a dementia facility before he dies.

t1_dumbk22	1	*	While I like your idea, that's not entirely true. The overall black market drug demand will be lower if you remove marijuana, making it harder for them to make as much money overall. You can't just remove their single largest cash crop and expect it not to hit their bottom line at all.

t1_dujodml	0	*	I wonder how much this investigation is costing the US. It certainly does seem like results are being made, so it may be worth it. It's kind of nice to see some transparency -- and I'm not even American.   Edit: Damn you guys hated this comment for some reason. I was just curious as I thought that this was a good idea and you seem to be getting good value for your money in this investigation. It was meant to be a positive and supportive comment, haha.

The difference being, accused murders in America go to court, have a trial, and if found guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, get sentenced to death. If you don't see the difference between the **ENORMOUS** hurtles one has to go over to get that far and merely pointing a finger at someone, then maybe you should go to the Philippines and do some research.

t1_dur1hur	0	*	Pretty much like the Left and Israel, they only care for what will make them seem correct, as for the actual country: let it fall to shits.  EDIT: I don't mean that I wish the country to fall to shits, I meant that those who care for the what will side their agenda don't actually care of the fate of the actual country, only these things that they can milk support out of, so to them it might as well fall to shits, and they just won't care.

t1_dupc5z4	1	*	Just like the current genocide happening in various countries around the world is being ignored. Look at the rohingiya, the countries leader says everything is fine while a bunch of countries leaders say something isn't right -  you should look into it , but no country wants to interfere since there's no political, territorial or monetary gain.    Its taken them over a century to acknowledge the Armenian genocide and many countries still don't recognise it.

t1_duq8omc	1	*	What we're going to find is that Russia one hundred percent orchestrated the US election and division in the country a la DUGIN. They also probably influenced brexit to cut off UK from Europe a la... you guessed it, DUGIN.   Unfortunately Trump was just a puppet who actually thought he was winning by himself.. the team though like Manafort was in bed with Russia. Trump will probably still go down due to incompetence, no way he didn't do something that Mueller will miss.

The UK produces about 1.6 million cars a year, most of them for export. That entire industry dies with Brexit. Or to be exact, it fucks off to France or Spain or Italy or whichever country with a slightly wobbly economy offers the best deal to the manufacturers.

t1_duh70bc	1	*	I disagree. There are numerous parallels to the Watergate scandal. That investigation lasted just over two years, but eventually led to 48 convictions and the resignation of President Nixon in order t avoid impeachment. This case will be no different.  As Richard Ben-Veniste, of the Watergate special-prosecutor task force, put it: I would say this is High-Level Special Counsel Investigation 101. Mueller is operating by the book.

There is no left in the US and their democrats has almost as bad a record on environment, gun control, corporate bribery, lax bank regulation, poor social services, poor healthcare advocacy, poor anti-war sentiment as their republicans.

t1_duh6x5q	1	*	It's no secret the establishment gop hates trump with burning passion. If the 2018 election goes bad for them, they will drop trump like a hot potato. They know that 2020 will be a super important race, not just for the presidency, but for the state legislatures (2020 census).   The only reason they're in power right now is they rigged a lot of seats with gerrmandering in 2010.   Right now the GOP is in a holding pattern. It really all comes down to this november.
t1_duqux19	0	*	Yes, you can. To private citizens directly. But of course, you'd need to know who to mail it to. If you're really serious about it, look for local community centers, churches and social media groups, looking for Venezuelan community leaders and ask around. I know of at least two online communities that have banded together and try to help from outside.
t1_dud7o1s	1	*	Because Hillary would have put tougher economic sanctions against them. Trump said multiple times during the campaign wouldnt it be nice to get along with Russia?. Russia saw Trump not as vulnerable but as someone who would do less harm to their economy through sanctions.
t1_duurez0	0	*	It is the split of the polar vortex.  It is an occasional weather phenomenon.  When it happens, the vortex of winds holding cold air in the north splits into two.  This weakening allows the cold air at the surface to drift south as it is displaced with warm air.  This is normal.    https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polar_vortex

That money still fucking rules over everything else. You can't eat money.   And what is frustrating is there are STILL lots of people out there who are anti-science.

t1_duoa4rf	0	*	Is it possible that police use of lethal force is a reaction to the proliferation of guns, the increased willingness to use them and the closing of their previous means of gaining compliance (severe beatings)?  I always wondered if American police were scared of all the guns and the changes in their rules of engagement, and so were reacting with the tools that are available to them.
t1_duad630	0	*	The thing I find strange in that case is, the official report states that US SOF contacted the Russian military liaison to confirm whether or not there were any official Russian personal engaged in the assault. They got the green light and proceeded with the counter offensive. Reports state at least 200 Russians from Wagner group (PMC) were killed in that operation. It was not very tactical of them to make a ground assault against a group with an AC-130 for air support.

We got Trump in office to prove that you don't need sanity, or even policy to get elected, you just need a strong message, well now hes got a fucking great one.  20 bucks says something like that appears in a speech soon.

t1_duy6mrv	1	*	Jacob Zuma is no longer the President. He was ousted by his Deputy Cyril Ramaphosa. The ANC are playing a dangerous game capitulating to the extreme left socialist (actually Fascist) leanings of the EFF trying to gain back votes. However this actually strengthens the EFF's hand as an opposition party with less than 10% is now dictating the order of the day.

Many have been single people with a knife - but for sake of counting these are basically equal to the Bataclan attack. So the numbers are pointless - there are far far far too many attacks than is acceptable and it is now just the new normal. 
t1_dufb9p1	1	*	I mean even if he did, would you really expect him to act by the facts and be reasonable?
t1_duglxh9	1	*	Interesting reaction to relatively mild criticism you have here!  You really do seem like a citizen of the nation that voted for Trump :D
t1_duwjkx0	0	*	The USA did the same thing, used govt planes and military planes to move coke and heroin.    Shits ridiculous, it proves how much of a racket drug prohibition is.
t1_dui8vki	1	*	He knows that the french revolution actually DID happen. 
t1_duuplya	1	*	/r/PATRIOTSBEINGBROS
t1_duobscg	1	*	Al gore's not a scientist
t1_dugaf1q	1	*	The takeout shots, where you push the rock as hard as you can while still being accurate, to knock multiple rocks out of the house (circle), require a good amount of stength to do properly. 
t1_duxb2tj	1	*	Bahahahahahahaha.... idiot.
t1_duk25sg	1	*	Yea.  My thing all along was he's been setting up his son in law Jared to take the fall for everything. 
t1_duf14lv	1	*	You reprobates would probably enslave yourselves again before you made it across the Atlantic. But third times the charm, ja? Good luck, we'll be waiting here with our backward gun culture
t1_dud08vk	0	*	what exactly is taurine and why would it be dangerous, to begin with?
t1_dui1suc	1	*	Because it's analysing data up to 2014, maybe? Why would that be in the news... Just the Independant spewing its usual fake news. 
t1_dusflqr	1	*	Power and influence, mostly
t1_duovh39	1	*	They don't need to kill him and, in fact, they prefer not to.   It's not like he's ever gonna win.
t1_durnxq2	1	*	they also imprisoned people in a space that can only fit a person standing up for days, so those unlucky enough getting this japanese hospitality would shit and pee himself while standing up, weebs wouldn't believe this monstrosity though because those anume are too cute
t1_duptfkn	1	*	They really thought their Russian SAM systems would protect them. First things that got droned I bet. 
t1_dur204l	0	*	Ken M's playing ground.
t1_dubsccd	1	*	Without having read the story that might be what happened, if they had gone through legitimate channels it's likely this would have taking longer thanks to bureaucracy 
t1_duoccgh	1	*	Don't forget Raqqa, either.
t1_dusm89b	1	*	That's just life.  
t1_dujhyke	1	*	Despite seeing posts about this in both r/worldnews a few times a week, the reason you see more about the US is because that's a constantly changing situation day to day. You can only restate this article so many times between updates.
t1_duk814p	1	*	Interesting. But I just wanna know why they didn't name it Forest Trump.
t1_dudrfrr	1	*	Sydney Harbour does have a history of a lot of industrial activity. The worst of it is long gone, but their are still warnings about eating fish caught on the inland side of the harbour (beyond the harbour bridge) due to potential heavy metal issues. East of the bridge its just regular seawater.
t1_dutp5b9	0	*	The doctor who started it is from the UK.

t1_dus4t1q	1	*	What's the deal with dictators having no fucking grasp of reality? How could that sentence ever make sense in his mind?
t1_dursntx	1	*	Lol at the idea that somehow someone or something should be controlling what private companies like Apple are allowed to put on their devices. 
t1_dubpoji	1	*	Phooey was the best character on Friends. Discuss.
t1_dubqfjf	1	*	I have read and agree.
t1_duxedzp	1	*	So like most countries these days.
t1_dudbw0n	1	*	The indictment refers to it as information warfare.  We've *been* at war, we just didn't know it because our idea of it is limited to military force.
t1_duqlkta	1	*	with Insurance coverage that is.
t1_duqrqdr	1	*	Every human ambition is a racket...

t1_duiz9qa	1	*	Must have at least 1 gay man per household or you will be executed
t1_duonb42	1	*	There's the classic one of the downed CIA plane with 10 tons of cocaine and 2 tons of heroin ...  Then 8 tons of cocaine and 1 ton of heroin ...  then 5 tons of cocaine ...  then 2 tons of cocaine and a regular plane.
t1_dulf8wa	0	*	It will because people will fight for it one way or another. Either by democracy or civil war.
t1_dunxrrp	0	*	> Despite changing their statement multiple times, the video contradiction, and the murder, you guys are just holding the line.  It's what they're paid to do. 
t1_ducjsj3	1	*	> Location can be determined by the user's language settings, geolocation tags, other followed accounts, the origin of content they share (sometimes a direct copy/paste from RT), etc.  That doesn't mean they're paid Russian shills.   Edit: If you're going to downvote at least explain to me how I'm wrong. I'll wait. 
t1_duw1gmc	1	*	> What's that about? Why would they want to use such a tainted term?  What do you mean?
t1_dur8ybw	1	*	Seems pretty difficult to hit the sweet spot. Either prescribe it early before your even sure it's the flu, and you over prescribe, or you wait until you're sure it's the flu and then it's potentially to late to be effective?
t1_dukjq22	1	*	well, it is not like they are being transparent about it, but at a certain stage can't hide reality when so many people involved... covering up bodies and people in hospital is hard.
t1_duppq28	1	*	Buy a printer
t1_dujvr7z	1	*	Vote in the midterm.
t1_dur35pr	1	*	Lol, savage.
t1_ducsvwq	0	*	Yeah, we refuse. We're not going to allow a third attempt by Germany to 'unite' Europe.
t1_duvmlzg	1	*	Just another unfortunate casualty of state-socialism... Always the same story. 
t1_duyfgvb	0	*	 Of course this is a community of many different viewpoints and people. But there has always been a strong anti whale current, here.   /r/worldnews has had a very long and ambivalent history about whales 
t1_dune2y5	1	*	I actually find it easy to believe, as easy as breathing while I sleep.
t1_ducxe8i	0	*	The same indictment says it had no effect on the election. Even if it was found it had a major effect, nothing would happen.
t1_dut28za	1	*	*were disappointed
t1_dujjqu2	1	*	Yep. Massive deindustrialization is the only solution. Of course, that gets optimists and hope addicts undies all twisted up because science and tech will save us someday in the future.   Someday my prince will come too.
t1_duhb0lp	0	*	because the civilians are not terrorists, what Israel is doing is called collective punishment which is against human rights. They are attacking civilian houses and killing teenagers without proof they participated in the terrorit attacks.
t1_duh2sqs	0	*	Mainly delivery work
t1_duucux3	1	*	Im going to assume youre not in Indonesia because Reddit is actually banned there
t1_dufurfu	1	*	Yeah, it always baffles me that people slate media outlets like the BBC or Sky News of being left AND right wing, but all they do is report events and then move on to the next segment. I used to watch some Fox News just to see how different it was. About 1/3 of the time was adds and 1/2 of it was just opinion pieces about news events.  I couldn't stand it, or fathom why people watch it. 
t1_duq5rze	1	*	Relevant Last Week Tonight clip.  https://youtu.be/QCjk_NPsIqU?t=909
t1_duhy2w3	0	*	I forgot about my 'Snake people to millennials' plugin. I was wondering why there were snake people in the UK. 
t1_dup6r8c	1	*	>Poor Americans  Nah. They voted for Trump, and they got Trump. They got what they asked for, and you can't sympathise with people for that.

t1_duijzon	0	*	At what age is a fetus too old to abort?
t1_duw5hey	1	*	As a fellow poster on the Arctic Sea Ice Forum iid encourage anyone with a rational objective view  to sit back and read. The information collated, developed and posted there by well informed climate scientists, meteorologists, earth scientists and caring environmentalists is worth your time an energy. Good job, Neven.
t1_dubp4eo	1	*	That is precisely what the long article says (eventually).
t1_duj1ijx	1	*	See that...this is Vlad...he's gay and cold and hungry. For pennies a day you can sponsor him...no? TOO BAD  VOTE PUTIN

t1_duxyoai	1	*	Thanks for this. For a moment there I thought of something not good. Gotta love these chicks.
t1_ducszko	1	*	The moment any of these people step foot in *any* country besides Russia or maybe North Korea, they're getting shipped to the US.
t1_ducz77b	0	*	Palm oil is like coconut oil, a healthy, stable, natural fat. Attempts at demonising it were to increase sales of local fats and ban foreign ones.   What we need to sort out is how it's produced because it's a disgrace.
t1_dulq24r	1	*	Why are these bots not down yet? If new bots are sprung each day, why is no control check by twitter on it? It is like not having a policing system and expecting a criminal to develop a conscience and stop!? If we are having such a system, then the system is not sophisticated enough to handle the crime, so the focus should be on that. 
t1_dul9q38	1	*	They're the antichrist. That's why I use Linux. 
t1_dusdhfa	1	*	Yep but still better then Abbott
t1_duwuc77	0	*	Does Corbyn even want to be in power? he's doing everything to ensure people *won't* vote for his party
t1_dugtfce	1	*	That's how flipping stupid he is. 
t1_dur249k	1	*	> People get the leader they vote for.  Only 23% of eligible voters turned out for Trump, less than a quarter, so fuck all you cunts who didn't bother.  Then again, based on the quality of the candidates, can understand why.
t1_dur698n	1	*	Why has the Far Left begun to completely ignore a country they *cared* so much about since the turn of the millenium until about two or three years ago? lol
t1_dup9pb5	1	*	Stupid takes offense to that.
t1_duqv1tv	1	*	you'll be missed, I'm sure
t1_dui8zse	1	*	I get to make a whole $10 more a paycheck now. Yay. 
t1_duwzrfp	1	*	> At this point it's unclear why Ireland doesn't bulge and just accept free money.  It would mean letting go of being a tax haven.
t1_dujjtzi	1	*	I think Bible pushers is precise terminology. So many Christians that don't subscribe to the Evangelical voting bloc have resisted Trump from the get-go.   It really is a horrific anthropological wonder how Americans tend to weaponize Christianity to suit secular political goals without the government being a theocracy. I say that as an American Christian. 
t1_dui3dpu	1	*	Vox didn't do the research, they're merely reporting it. The facts don't change based on who links them.  [Speaking of Crowder, you should watch this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrNmq4ouWww)
t1_dudlptg	0	*	They already have a nuke. They've had nukes since 2006.    ICBMS are a different story, and since 3 months ago they can strike most of the US. So what now, you actually have cities on the line so you wont attack? Its okay bombing another country if there is no blowback? Americans are such cowards.
t1_duw0rha	1	*	Skynet did nothing wrong 
t1_duzeqwq	1	*	o. He's the ma.
t1_duepd7z	1	*	In Argentina they would have done nothing about it
t1_dusj940	1	*	Really good point. They are great at building tunnels and a wall would be simple! And much cheaper!! 
t1_duhmw4g	1	*	If the Netherlands can pump sea water away from seabeds to clear land for farms and houses, I'm sure the US can find a way to protect Florida.  Of course, the best would be that the world uses mostly their feet and bicycles, and eat much less meat. 
t1_dup7wsh	1	*	Nah, that happens every time when he organizes a rally
t1_dunw26h	1	*	More meat product and BBQ sauce.

t1_duxeuh6	1	*	We did the opposite. Bought just as the scandal broke. Saved a little bit and theyre fantastic cars. 
t1_dudmc2r	1	*	If Trump trusts Putin more that the FBI, why wouldn't Tillerson trust the Turkish foreign minister more than an American diplomatic translator? You gotta trust autocrats, or nothing gets done.

t1_duxflo1	1	*	Da. Like my fellow canadian citizen here, me also think Trudeau is greatest PM ever and you should vote him! Trudeau strong like bear! Maybe not strong like russian bear because russian bear strongest bear in world, but strong like much weaker american bear. Only Putin strong as russian bear! Even stronger!! Much, much stronger!!! And smarter!!!! Putin best in everything!!!!!  ... where was I...   Vote Trudeau my fellow canadian citizens!
t1_dupah3j	1	*	Not on twitter because we were more professional back then

t1_dun2dyi	1	*	Wow, it hurts to read your comment -- my parents, smart and wonderful people in their personal relations -- have become frightened, racist, braindead, credulous rubes of the Trump administration when it comes to politics.  They both also lack the ability to avoid being scammed, and I think that's a key thing. I don't know if the younger generation has more street smarts, but my parents seem positively incapable of identifying a con.

You just bring back your other glass containers and we'll clean and sterilize them before putting them back into distribution.    No more plastic yogurt containers for 4 oz servings, no more styrofoam or plastic for meat products, no more waste really. 95% of what I throw away that isn't recyclable or compostable is from food products.    Any investors??

t1_duvg8gc	1	*	This is the President of the United States (you do know how powerful the US is right?) cracking jokes in the White House is one thing, but going on the record with statements of executing Americans (if it is a joke) that is delusional.  
t1_duqahas	0	*	I too believe that these problems are American made, but if the first domino in their undoing is illegal campaign contributions, then let it fall.  Russian funding obviously didn't create bigotry and infighting in our country.  I don't think anyone is that deluded.  Hopefully, justice isn't scapegoating Russia, it's just starting there.

t1_dulm7td	1	*	That is correct, Komerade. Now, are you attending that rally I organized next week to protest the false flag operation? Free vodka!
t1_dui7c3w	0	*	They have a $9.61 billion surplus, but only $700 million is being given back to citizens. About half the surplus is to be used to help cover the costs of building new rail lines.  They probably still could invest the $700 million in other ways, but taxpayers generally aren't happy with government surpluses as it means the government is taking more from them than it needs. A one-time pay-out keeps taxpayers placated without having to lower taxes.

She had every expectation that the world would find Trump less reprehensible than Herself. Amazingly, she was wrong. Instead of campaigning on issues, she campaigned against Trump.   So you can thank the DNC and the Clintonites for Trump.  Hillary is now the poster child for Cheaters Never Prosper

t1_duq9qv3	1	*	Exactly. It's like what Mueller already stated about the Trump admins contact with the Russian trolls: it was *unwittingly*. I'm still a little blown away at all the people who choose to ignore that. Michael Moore, CBS, and NBC were just as unwittingly protesting in Anti-Trump protests set up by the trolls as the old grandmother in Florida.

Japan as a nation isn't saying this, at least not openly and officially. This is just someone's opinion, someone who isn't currently representing Japan or UK any more.

t1_dumcnqn	1	*	Only really sanctions (that would need agreement from lots of countries, and make ordinary Cambodians suffer) would do much.

t1_duowb7s	0	*	Is your logic that Americans should hold and keep guns because cops are more evil?   Also it isnt a fair comparison when youre comparing apples with oranges. Why dont you look up the total number of gun deaths (not just mass shootings) vs cop kills? According to Wikipedia it was 33,xxx in 2013. Over 100,000 injuries.   Please note that I am not saying cops are great and people are bad. I am just presenting data.

t1_dun698l	0	*	I'm thanking god every day for smart people like you, who can uncover the true motives of others.   We should dispell that notion that people should be allowed to decide on their own motives and determine the meaning of their own words.

t1_dual9dz	0	*	The water scare for Rio and Sao Paolo are directly caused by massive deforestation in Minas Gerais, Parana, Matt Grosso etc and their response? More logging and destruction. The scary thing is that they may have permanently destroyed their weather system and the area will turn to tropical savannahs with no where near enough water to sustain the huge populations. But hey ho, a flat in Rio can go for 3 Mill.....

t1_dunfn33	1	*	I guess that's why Putin was so scared of his youtube videos /s
t1_dulha65	1	*	I came into the comments to say this, but as it's been said I'll just add that as it works out however you likely have a conservative christian detailing the world's religions which is kinda prone to condescension and favoritism.

The magnitude scale which measures earthquakes is logarithmic which means a proper scary quake, the likes of which you'd expect in places like Christ Church or California are literally tens of thousands of times more powerful.

t1_dugdw6b	1	*	In Europe, it is only practiced by the religious, and is far less common than in the US.  Public hospitals do not offer it, and if requested, refuse to perform it.  With the remaining performed by religious groups in potentially unsanitary environments, many countries are moving to restrict our outlaw the practice.

I hate the man with a passion, and Im inclined to believe he knew damn well what was happening and he cooperated with Russia, but if the FBI investigation vindicates him of any wrongdoing, that will be that and we need to focus on foreign adversaries that mean us harm. 
t1_durj6il	1	*	Really disgusting, but the millions of victims who never spoke out, because their raper is important to their environment are on another scale.  We need to find a way to make them speak. 
t1_dua4ot7	1	*	> The EU weakens the UK's power at the United Nations  EU has nothing to do with UN regarding this. UK was never a true member of the EU. It always reserved the right to overthrow any rule given by the EU. You gain nothing with a brexit, except a worse deal with the EU, who now know the UK is not a reliable partner.

t1_ducyoce	1	*	Careful everybody, this guy's a Russkie, I can smell it. He's trying to worm his way into our good graces so we'll trust him and think he's with this project. But soon, almost imperceptibly, he'll begin to skew things a bit. And then more and more and more and pretty soon we'll all be ganging up on the Boy Scouts for being a traitorous paramilitary force right here inside our own borders.
t1_duj85iw	1	*	It is worrisome that many people are believing the headline that this has anything to do with Putin or trying to cause panic. It's blatant anti-russian propaganda.

t1_dukclfk	1	*	There is a lot of media spin here.  A loooot.  They try to confuse the collusion vs. meddling vs. hacking vs facebook memes.  For example I think people that thought the Russians helped get Trump elected must feel like idiots now that it's come out that they were playing both sides like a fiddle including hosting anti-Trump rallies.

t1_dugx84v	1	*	At this point, liberal media just makes up whatever headline they want, and then say it was a couple of sources that said it.  They will throw in some nice adjectives like top official or other subjective titles, and then sell it to the masses for clickbait and liberal circlejerking.

t1_dus7ogr	0	*	Can we put it in your backyard?
t1_duglk2x	1	*	Actually I think banning it on gender grounds is one of the strongest arguments we have. It's a simple fact the law is not equal - girls are protected, boys are not.  In the UK we recently passed stronger legislation against FGM - that's a recent law that completely ignores male mutilation. How the absolute fuck is it legal for one gender and not another?  We need to start pushing this like crazy. I hope Iceland does this, it will make the argument stronger for other nations.

t1_dugbl21	0	*	US deports immigrants all the time. Obama deported the most out of any Presidents for example.  I think a lot of people understand that more people from poor countries will seek a better life in richer countries than those can support and it is perfectly reasonable to send back those as you cannot take care of everyone.  The difference is generally the rhetoric around it and how you describe those people.

t1_dudn0nr	1	*	Its a stepping stone to producing hydrogen from water
t1_dule2zz	1	*	In the 90s it was only Christian text (New Testament) study, we had an elderly priest who would dictate how we were to think without room for discussion or debate on topics like divorce or abortion. Other world religions never came up. By the time we got to 5th year, we had a young teacher fresh out of college who knew we didn't have any interest in the subject & would put on videos like Reservoir Dogs or let us do homework or study for other subjects.
t1_duw68zs	1	*	Most people have better things to do 
t1_durztka	1	*	Hey, even the russian bots in reddit needs to mourn once inawhile yea
t1_dui14w2	1	*	The worst part, for me and many I know, is the damned student loan debts. Grew up in poverty, needed loans to make it through college to get out of poverty, and now saddled with insane loans and interest rates. 
t1_duquyn9	1	*	> Wait...plead...down to guilty to Conspiracy against the United States. We have part of the Trump Team who has said, Yes, I conspired against the United States? I'm going to yell here....HOW THE HELL IS THAT NOT A BIG DAMNED DEAL?!!  Isn't it because the conspiracy was something involving tax evasion five years ago?
t1_durnyet	0	*	5000 years, sure. Even Arabs as such barely exist for 2000 years, nevermind Syrian civilization

t1_duj1upo	1	*	You say that now, but wait until Trumpetina is voted as President of the United Domestic Animals organisation.  She'll make Cats great again! You just watch, all that fake news coming from Canine News Network will be proven wrong!
t1_duizu7d	1	*	It all stems from Christian fundamentalism, which stems from Lot's text in the Old Testament. But Russia is socially conservative that they haven't gotten over what some book written before the bronze age told them.   There is a progressive movement in Russia, but they're kept down by an overly oppressive government run by a dictatorial figure. 
t1_dub46cf	1	*	It also helps that this story was published in the BBC 3 days ago, but was reported in RFE/RL and Meduza last week.   Serious deja vu when you see the same story everyday for a week. Reddit is seriously late to the party here.
t1_dum0dsh	1	*	Way more than $100 million by the time you have it on the tarmac.
t1_duptvst	1	*	Worst kind of land reform. You are supposed to give land *to* farmers, not take *from* them. South Korea had land reform too but it was by taking land away from landlords *with compensation* and then the government leased land to farmers for a specific amount of time after which the land would become the farmer's own property. North Korea on the other hand just killed landlords and nationalized land. Only in South Korea, farmers got to own their means of production. How ironic.
t1_dugb6zr	1	*	Israel dulls the senses.
t1_dunghcs	1	*	The first **economic** sanctions were passed on Aug 25, 2017. Yet there have been shortages and rocketing inflation since 2009.

t1_ducy221	1	*	This should be at the top. They've been considering this for decades and if the WTO existed before the 1990s, Great Britain would have considered filing a complaint against Germany. The US would have considered filing a complaint against Japan.   Nothing's going to happen and in 30 years we'll be hearing about China considering filing a WTO complaint against Vietnam or Nigeria.

How do you Americans sleep at night with so much fear? Need guns and border walls and the biggest military with enough nuclear weapons to blow up the world a few thousand times over. What are you all doing that you're so fucking afraid?

t1_duafxuf	1	*	No it is not really necessary. The separate drugs are widely available and pretty cheap. Having to take two tablets is a mild inconvenience that doesn't add up to the cost of the combination. It could be relevant for people that are extremely confused or have a high amount of tablets to swallow a day (pill burden), but for those cases the US price is way too high.

t1_dusnkcg	1	*	Russia unashamedly serves their own ends to everyone else's destruction. They don't need to directly control every nation in order to run the world, they just need to keep the world just chaotic enough to prevent anything being done about it.
t1_duxk8xp	1	*	Forced is the key word there. No one has ever said being forced to do anything is freedom.

t1_dud38p1	1	*	Doesn't the US and China and India and Canada and the UK and France and Germany and Israel and basically every single nosy developed nation do this sort of thing regularly? I also think it'd be fair to say that the US is, by fucking *light years*, the frontrunner in this sort of thing and has been for at least 70 years. Now that Edward John Smith is captaining the ship I'm sure everything is just fucking ducky.  I say Boo hoo. This humble pie the US is eating is mostly crow.   Splash

t1_dueh3q5	1	*	Even if KJU and his regime decided to just walk away and leave the place as-is, its going to be a huge mess for the rest of the world, but more specifically for Russia, China, and SK. Theres no way a nation of 50 million people (SK) can carry a nation of 25 million destitute people. Its going to seriously affect the population of SK well into the distant future.   Even worse if we have to luck their ass militarily before they take a hike. 
t1_duyhjyo	1	*	There are many private citizens who are aware and realize that the country was in the wrong. However, try talking about this to LDP or APA Hotel group.
t1_duhes48	1	*	What about Venezuela? Is it an American friendly country? Can they travel to North Korea too?
t1_dukdk4z	1	*	Still need wood. Properly maintained forestries arent a bad thing. They have been shipping the USA dirt cheap lumber for ages. 
t1_duv454u	1	*	Its ok, Im sure theyll start charging for using USB ports soon!
t1_dus8k4l	0	*	Do you even know anything about low band radar? The range wasn't the best decades ago but that's all fixed. And being low band stealth tech doesn't work to the point of being expensive and useless. High band radar it's pretty effective against but the Russians don't use high band for battlefield situational awareness.   But hey just keep believing what you like. Edit* Seemingly more people not actually understanding how different radar frequency's work. But that's Reddit in a nut shell.

t1_duqpxm7	1	*	In case no one else has said it yet, thank you for linking a pdf to the plea agreement.   Even though I come here mainly to expose myself to other peoples opinions,  it is refreshing to have a primary source to build off of and form my own opinion on verifiable documents/sources.   TL;DR thanks for the info source, you rock!
t1_duzkfis	1	*	It's a transformative work. Same as with Worhol. Otherwise he would have owed several comic artists and Campbell's Soup a huge amount of money.  The Dominoes is not, however. Changing hair, toppings & minor colour changes isn't transformative.
t1_duiwqga	0	*	Drought is a huge world wide issue. Australia, the Western United States, Central to Southern Africa are suffering. The issue in Cape town is more with corruption and poor infrastructure planning. They did not build the infrastructure to keep up with the population. The drought exacerbated that man made issue.

t1_duxiygj	1	*	It is not a democracy, it is a dictatorship.  The country is run by one man with all the power.  Women have limited rights and no way to change that without a regime change.

t1_duldtju	1	*	Giggity 
t1_duk5n7c	1	*	Exactly my first thought! Recently I saw some of his supporters here on Reddit claiming that the wave of sexual misconduct reports was thanks to him, because he exposed democrat power or whatever.  So I wouldnt be surprised if him or his supporters patted him on the back for this forest. 
t1_duz5wmi	0	*	Also, remember the engineering triangle: quick, cheap, or good; pick two. That Chinese project was either expensive as all hell or it's going to fall apart next year.

t1_duyjqne	1	*	> He's scraping the bottom of the barrel here.  Scraping the bottom of the barrel?  Anyone paying attention for the last ~6 months has known that his 2013 stint in Russia is what is almost certainly going to bring him down. There is so much shady shit and wrong doing that went on that weekend, it's ridiculous. 
t1_duacfw8	1	*	You don't need to be sherlock to realize Assange is pro Trump, you could just.. look at his tweets.   Almost looks like one of those Russian Trolls on twitter.

t1_duhe90x	1	*	You mean 10 Downing Street?
t1_dujmr31	1	*	And this is why it's not worth the time to argue with a Trump supporter.  No matter what the issue is they can honestly say that Trump supports or opposes it because he has legitimately staked out ground on both sides. 
t1_dufza9m	0	*	Their political opponents will be all over that date to undermine the seriousness of the event.

t1_dup7o8l	1	*	This shouldn't be interpreted that way. There are plenty of Muslim women who wouldn't shake hands with a man if prompted.   It isn't about seeing women as inferior, it is because it is seen as inappropriate to make physical contact with the opposite sex for both parties involved.  Inb4 rage, I'm atheist.

t1_dubp8e4	1	*	But if Americans keep killing themselves in mass shootings then maybe they wouldn't want to.
t1_dur50p3	1	*	next time maybe it should be a real ban, not only a flag ban.
t1_duk8dru	1	*	The dutch aren't acting against the UK, but rather preparing for the likely outcome. If anything the dutch are preparing to stay a large trading partner even if trades deals are failed to be negotiated.  Would  the dutch rather see the UK staying in the EU and thus easy trade? Ofcourse, but we didn't build the deltaworks for the weather we hoped will happen in the future.

t1_duiekhd	1	*	right? after training rigorously for four years, they've just suffered the worst disappointment of their lives in front of a worldwide audience of millions, and here comes a smiling, perfectly coiffed reporter making them run a gauntlet of inane questions. the amount of restraint shown by the losing athletes who show the appropriate level of 'team spirit' is, like, Olympian or some shit.

t1_dusvdlh	1	*	The US has taken a big blow in credibility in the rest of the world. Even if a normal person wins the election, it will take decades before the US can try to take the moral high ground and be taken seriously.  They've shown that no matter what's happening now, or the promises or the partnerships etc. are worth jack shit when a lunatic can reverse everything in the next election.

t1_dur22ii	1	*	It doesn't work that way. Multiply or divide Trump, and it never gets to good, using positive numbers.
t1_dugruzm	1	*	The US population was pretty pro-Russia after 1991. By the early Bush years we were getting fairly cozy. It wasn't until what, the mid-00s that we started to realize Russia is not our friend. And by 2010 or so that they were actively attacking us. 
t1_duxy7r3	1	*	To simply put, you done fucked up.
t1_dubpqdc	1	*	I feel like Bart did this in an episode of the Simpsons like 15 years ago. Can't remember the details though 
t1_dua4fc4	1	*	The sad truth is that our gun nuts wont actually read or believe the stats. They only want to keep their guns and the sick part is that they kind of dont care about whats happening. Hell, even if it happened to them they would just be psyched to use their gun the way theyve been claiming they would.

t1_dusigah	1	*	> wheres this money gonna be from? the rich?  I'd argue that the money comes from the middle class. The rich get tax breaks and business subsidies out the ying-yang.  So what's the difference between spending $6.4 billion on corporate welfare (Which Canada does on average each year) or just giving it to these people and cutting out the middleman?
t1_dud7ptl	0	*	The law has caught up, just look at the GDPR. (the new data protection law in the EU executed from May onwards)  The law isnt perfect but it changes many of the current practices. What will need to catch up however, is the courts. It will take some years until the first big cases have gone through to the EU courts :(

t1_dufdea9	1	*	Interfering on the behalf of the people more likely to push that kind of imperialist foreign policy to justify annexing your neighbors is pretty goddamn evil.  As always, corporatists and other right wing interests are behind the vast majority of the US's crimes. 
t1_dubl49x	1	*	So far the pattern has been to cause a such mayhem as possible. The Russian groups have actually staged protests and anti-protests to clash. They're just ruling everyone up to make it harder for us to do anything politically.

What about the totally biased and dishonest Media coverage in favor of Crooked Hillary?   Those tweets are a bitch huh.   You guys are really worrisome with the  lack of memory and constant excuse making.   Hint: if you find yourself constantly making excuses and rephrasing.  Shits fucked up. 
t1_duy0bc2	0	*	This. Reminds me of back in the day when youd hear about anti-abortion activists getting themselves jailed because theyd do shit like fill a clinics doorway with cement.  You aint helping your cause here, folks. It makes you look silly (or extremist) to the people youre trying to convince.
t1_dupgkub	1	*	>They also pay 50% taxes so dont get too exited  Except, you know, the part where they don't have even a marginal rate of 50% (let alone a 50% tax rate).  You need to be making 300,000 ($370,000) to even hit a tax rate of 40% before deductions and credits.

t1_duh6csw	1	*	> Imagine the furor if Obama is the president and the Republicans are busy going privately to companies, corporations, and others to say that Obama is bad and dont listen to him.  They wouldn't do that though, that's a false equivalence. Trump is not equal to Obama just because he has the same title Obama had. 
t1_dupwz94	1	*	Yes, the Chinese bots got raped.
t1_duekbva	1	*	Reminds me of a similar case that happened in France. There it was all over the news that politician so and so said that French-Israelis have to choose between French and Israeli nationality, as they can't have both. The actual law proposal was that French are only allowed to have a nationality of an European country, but not those outside of Europe, which means that Israel, US, Russia, China, etc. all were treated the same. The article also didn't mention the actual question that was answered.
t1_duhyiew	1	*	Of course they don't.

All of these things happen too regularly and too sporadically for your hypothesis to make sense.

t1_duqh1jq	1	*	>Fuck military and protectionism  I was actually learning about this in studies about security the other day, and investing large amounts into military is ridiculous in 2018 when there are so many cooperative institutions, albeit a hegemony where America is the leader, for defence.

t1_dugco8x	1	*	Incorrect! Israel does receive a small amount of money from the USA, but nowhere near a significant portion of their budget. And the USA's money is almost all in military contracts, not actual cash or securities.

t1_dua5nc5	1	*	There was a similar suggestion in a discussion during the last gun shooting in the US. Adamant gun owners were seriously suggesting the solution to preventing future shootings was to introduce more guns and arm good people with guns. They referenced that's how the shooting in Las Vegas (?) was stopped.   It's near impossible to convince gun lovers that more guns is not a solution to *prevention* of mass shootings.

What if they're just trying to rally support for whatever policy will weaken our nation and divide us?  Both are true. At the moment, there is one party whose entire platform is uniformly unpopular, and is headed by an impulsive autocrat who says outrageous things. If you want to weaken and divide a country, you throw everything you can behind that party.
t1_duylh0h	1	*	Whats the break-even point? Considering apple paid about 400 million in taxes last year it would take 41 years for Ireland to lose more than they would have made if they just took the lump sum. 
t1_duhptjy	0	*	In the US they have a patent for a few years they they lose it allowing anybody to make the drug. The system isn't perfect but it's designed to encourage drug research (why sink money into something you won't get back?) And later down the road make it cheap.

t1_duif5hl	1	*	Article states, she wanted to go back home to her son. Maybe her son could come visit her in South Korea? Then again, maybe she should sell everything the owns, the house, all her possessions and go back to North Korea, to help protect her son. You know, from any accidents that might happen. Not that an accident might happen, but obviously the mother would want to protect him from an accident, so she'll return to North Korea, but not because of the implication.

t1_duutfuz	1	*	You can't candidate for president in Italy  EDIT: To the idiot that downvoted me, you have no idea of how it works in Italy.  You don't elect the president, you get to vote for the composition of the parliament, and the leader(or the designed candidate) meets with the President of the Republic  and has to form a new government(he picks the ministers), then the government has to obtain the vote of the majority of the parliament, and once he does, he becomes the new Prime Minister.

Problem is, they never engaged with the reasonable arguments of the other side. A reasonable person might believe in his right to be armed, but the trollslayer is convinced that he must want every teacher to be armed as well.

However, we enjoyed this public service announcement one of our former presidents recorded for the Americans: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYZKrn7Bbl8  That was about a year ago. Still no response.

They did this to protect domestic solar panel manufacturers.  After those tariffs were passed, China found a loophole involving Taiwan, so in 2014 the Obama administration expanded the tariffs to include Taiwan to close that loophole.  After that, Chinese companies started setting up shop outside of China, in places like Malaysia.

t1_dudo52d	0	*	That would be fascinating. I'd also like to see this technology applied to Egypt and especially Sub-Saharan Africa. 
t1_dup0h8m	1	*	No, I can't because this only makes so-called anti-facism activism look worse and is an exhibition of the very behavior they are supposedly against. Physically beating political ideology into/out of people isn't acceptable behavior, and I don't give a shit if your perspective on it comes from your grandma escaping the Nazis on a hangglider or unicycle. It only makes your opinion on the matter more biased.
t1_dubspjm	1	*	My favorite 
t1_dugwd1h	1	*	Good point. I'm Iranian and I agree with you.
t1_dui850v	1	*	Hey, regular middle class person here, my annual take home went up by quite a bit more than $70 a year, actually a couple thousand. 
t1_duxellh	1	*	Cause no other country in the world has had its governments overthrown by its people as many times as China.

t1_duno3gw	1	*	> when all the nutrition you would need from fish can also be found in seeds why would you kill fish ?  I am all for reducing the world consumption of fish and meat but this is a ridiculous way of approaching the subject. Obviously people eat a certain fish or animal because of its taste not its particular nutritious value. If thats all that was important we would simply swallow pills for most of the day. 
t1_duf7kju	1	*	well the logic is if we might have a war in the future, we might as well start now
t1_duc9lgh	1	*	So does Putin. 
t1_duyktq3	1	*	Alternatively, it's an investigation into corrupt as fuck treason at the highest levels that will reach it conclusion once they can put Trump in prison.
t1_dutkczc	1	*	Agreed.  If you choose to remain a member of modern society there are certain things you HAVE to do to stay a member.  You cant burn down your neighbours house and fence just because you want your yard to be bigger in the same sense that you cant not vaccinate your kids because Jenny McCarthy told you so.  
t1_dujf0ou	1	*	> China could have easily bought him off.  I honestly think there might be some truth to this.  Between his essentially giving up Philippine claims in territorial disputes (despite lying about it initially), his alienating the US / West, his eagerness to take Chinese development loans (instead of looking at alternatives), and his trying to railroad the entry of China Telecom into the country despite it being explicitly against the Constitution, the evidence is mounting.

t1_dui8aw2	0	*	Unfortunately, he's running counter to 90% of the rich who are only in it for themselves.  It's part of the US cultural mindset. Get rich. Individualistic. Capitalistic.   Theres enough money for a safety net. There really is.

t1_duhg9mx	0	*	There is no way of knowing what products. The study included 6000+ people and ran for 20 years. They were split in three groups: not cleaning, cleaning at home or cleaning as job. Lung capacity was measured. And then the researchers came back 20 years later and measured again.  Whatever the culprit, the results are extremely worrying. Cleaning products are killing lungs as bad as tobacco.
t1_dutja6q	1	*	Really buddy? Really? A gas leak?  Fuckin hell

t1_duiev8z	1	*	Medically indicated circumsitions won't be outlawed, don't start just making up arguments. Also your numbers are _way_ off.

t1_duszzt9	1	*	I don't think parliamentary democracies have term limits. Canada doesn't.

Again. Washington State residents just hate the idea of a fair tax system, it seems. 
t1_dukh0ta	1	*	Yes, the terrorists are the Assadist forces committing warcrimes all over Syria. The IRGC and Hezbollah backed by Russian PMCs. These are the terrorists.

t1_duw8bt7	0	*	Russian bots does not equate to Russia as a whole. We don't know for sure if the Russian government is behind it or not. This whole neo-McCarthyism is not only xenophobic, but extremely dangerous. What would you like to see happen? War? More sanctions that only serve to hit the poor and middle class? This whole narrative has gone way too far.

t1_dundqjt	1	*	Who did you think did that?
t1_duchm2d	0	*	The east will never see environmentalism as a public cause, because their cultures are not linked to the great outdoors in anyway. What I mean is, your average dentist from Jakarta doesn't go kayaking on the weekends or hunting in the autumn.

t1_dueu7fe	1	*	Probably get an interview with the daily mirror
t1_dujgz2u	1	*	Look! A car chase! 
t1_duw3dd2	1	*	Thing is, yes, there is a natural climate change. However, we speed that process up to such an extend that nature just can't adjust to it this fast.

t1_duf8pk9	1	*	Do you really think he would have assaulted him if he had a gun?
t1_dudicmr	0	*	Does that matter? Isnt the important part that another country is trying to affect our election through surreptitious means? Who care who won, just the fact this is happening should help us protect our elections. I think Trump supporters are incorrectly reading this as a plot to undermine Trump whereas it is actually a plot to undermine democracy. 
t1_dugaxck	1	*	You could live like royalty on that in Vietnam. LET'S GO! DA LAT I SEE YOU REAL SOON
t1_ducpqza	1	*	Will anybody hold these tweets up as reasons to not work with the Russians?  Pretty much every ethnic group is insulted here, but particularly Muslim people (at least in the few I read).  Edit: autocorrect.
t1_dust18s	1	*	All in all Trump's just another dick with no balls. 
t1_dudxkx9	0	*	funny how conservatives used to be terrified of russians, now they desperately want to suck putins dick like they chugged some communist aphrodisiac.
t1_dujmb3t	0	*	This is what I was thinking. Geez, you can attack the man on so many levels, you don't need to twist the truth.  He repeatedly denied collusion or being involved with Russia. The article never gives a single source where he says Russia didn't try to interfere.

t1_duk0t0p	1	*	Pray tell, in your head, where do you think this is going?  The investigation is clearly not wrapping up, there were 14 indictments last week, the charges we're discussing here, and reports that Gates will plead guilty and cooperate against Manafort this week.  The cast of characters is getting larger and more diverse, and there's one thing in common: Trump.
t1_duuqsnh	0	*	When was this? Cause I know in 2014 there was the turbot 'war'
t1_dusgxhy	1	*	Note the number of refugees fleeing the middle east to Europe. A lot of people with the means to leave are doing so.
t1_duduqtq	1	*	This is just one of the many offensive things on CCTV. I hope you also want the people fired who lied about why so many died in the Wenchuan earthquake. And the ones who write all that anti-Japanese propaganda. And the ones who do those reports on Tibet and Xinjiang where the locals interviewed always love the government for some reason. And, and, and...  Chinese TV isn't only offensive to foreigners. Most of all, it's offensive to honest, hard-working Chinese people.
t1_ducqyou	1	*	This reminds me of the AskReddit thread I posted where I asked in earnest what people who actually met Trump thought of him. I got a flood of messages accusing me of being a bot or a paid spammer. Another problem is that this trend completely undermines legitimate discourse, so if you don't agree with someone's views or question their motivations it's too easy to dismiss everything that that person says.
t1_dua6k77	1	*	> We accept the risk of occasional gun violence, as the guarantee of personal liberty provided by responsible, background-checked citizen gun ownership far outweighs the cost.   I think you mean that YOU accept OTHER PEOPLE'S risk of gun violence so you can keep playing with your toys. 
t1_dujb19t	1	*	They invaded the Golan Heights and stole the water supply of neighbouring countries.    They also waste a fair bit of it growing crops that have no place in a desert.

t1_dudvfrz	1	*	No, then it's gouging insurance companies which is why insurance is so damned expensive
t1_dulf657	0	*	If it is found out one of them was innocent the entire mob should be lynched? Mob justice is simply murder.

t1_dukixbv	1	*	The NRA hasn't called for a ban on it, but has called for the same regulations that are on full-auto weapons. 
t1_dujarzz	1	*	I agree on both counts, maybe we need to import some football headline keywords like gazump.
t1_duskl9s	1	*	Lol Meade is not gonna win, not by any chance. This election (as for now) is between Anaya and Obrador.

t1_dusj7bc	1	*	Trump is not popular in Mexico. How would any candidate win on a pro-US platform? Pena is getting shit for not countering Trump strong enough.
t1_dusi03s	0	*	Has Canada nutted yet?
t1_dubm7mj	1	*	To be fair, the two main candidates in the American election did a pretty good job of dividing and alienating the American population all by themselves. Hillary called republicans the basket of deplorables, and trump told the pro-gun people to do their thing with her.  Neither of those statements are things that anyone in any form of leadership position should be saying, even as a joke. They're certainly not things you'd catch any other world leader saying in an election campaign.
t1_dubss64	1	*	Makes you think that Antifa is a huge, sprawling and organized extremist group, rather than just a vague label applied to a handful of tiny left-wing student groups whose mission is to oppose fascism.
t1_duwpsv1	1	*	Southern US gets hotter, your energy bills increase and most likely refugees from florida. 
t1_dupa6h8	1	*	Manafort is being charged with something that had nothing to do with Trump.  It happened when he worked for John Podesta.

t1_duinegb	1	*	> Many of my cousins aged 30-55 still live with their parents.. and that is normal.  TBF There is nothing inherently wrong with living with your parents as if they were your housemates and even taking care of them as they get older.     If anything, outsourcing the care of the elderly to people your age or even younger you don't even know is pretty weird in the face of it. 
t1_dunkulm	0	*	That could be a factor, but I don't think it's the most important. Switzerland for example is very culturally diverse,, you have Italian, German, French and Romansh Swiss living together and yet it's one of the safest countries in the world.  Then you look at places like Detroit, which are arguably very culturally homogeneous, and what you have is a warzone.
t1_duouovt	1	*	Reminds me of that episode of the wire where they catch a congressmans driver with a bag full of drug money and have to give it back.

t1_dulaypd	0	*	Over regulation lol, China is a totalitarian state.   Anyways, what is it with people excusing anything these days? Strippers at funerals? Well, it creates jobs! I honestly wish people were a little MORE judgey. If it was red necks in Alabama doing this we would see it for what it was... trashy, vulgar, gross.

t1_duofs1p	1	*	This is completely unacceptable analysis of the policing situation.  **Most** deaths by police are **justified.**  No, there is a much bigger problem with ethnic on ethnic violence, inter-city and gang violence, and issues in low income areas.   #PoliceAreNotTheProblem  
t1_duvurq1	1	*	I'm going to switch your service to renewable energy!  Rehehehehhehehehehehehehe
t1_dudsb5x	1	*	The price was jacked so high so you can pay say $25 whereas insurance pays $1000 and you pay your insurance company say $100 a month. So pretty much your paying 2 companies for the medicine you need when it should be hey pay 1 company $100

t1_dubfh02	1	*	I'm pretty sure a lot of people would think that Putin is somewhat an ass at this point.  And if people would like Putin, then why shouldn't they be annoyed if they have to put an opposition leader's name just to not get fucked in the ass at some point?
t1_dutt86q	1	*	They left a cardboard box out in the street with a stick holding it up. There was a sign nearby that pointed to it and said 'ISIS recruitment here'.   Simple tug of the string and you have yourself an extremist in a box.

t1_duluegt	1	*	I wish you the best with tackling your sobriety; I felt like the first 2 weeks were the most difficult. 
t1_dulgyj4	0	*	Us asians don't twerk.
t1_duc09u0	1	*	Most hospitals wont offer you a c-section in the U.K. without a medical reason. Or you pay privately. C-sections are expensive, man. 
t1_durpypk	0	*	What do you mean by NRA traitors?
t1_dueou2q	1	*	Thats the part that every body misses, everyone seees high drug prices and the reason why they stay high is insurance companies absorb the cost. We Americans see it in our insurance premiums. This is the same scheme that Valeant ran years ago and look where its lead them. They have the same prices and same issues, the only damage that was done was to their stock price; nothing for patient care or cost to insurance companies has changed at all. 
t1_duc09ur	1	*	> The bill, which has support from Prime Minister Gaston Browne, seeks to decriminalise the possession of less than 10 grams of cannabis for all adults, and allow Rastafarian people to legally use cannabis during religious rituals and ceremonies. It also aims to offset harms that criminalisation has caused by expunging prior convictions for minor cannabis offences.
t1_durc2lp	0	*	The fuck does that have to do with anything?!
t1_dun5m3d	1	*	its like no one has seen Gremlins... if youre gonna feed em, make sure it isnt after midnight...  the last thing we fucking need, is a bunch of fucking gremlins runnings around the internet fucking with elections....
t1_duk04y4	1	*	They don't see it that way. From their POV it's all just maneuvering to gain advantage.
t1_duy5wzk	1	*	Whoever wants a less close relationship with the U.S. and Europe I'd imagine.
t1_duezjki	1	*	Turtles sex is not temperature dependent!
t1_dupe2sw	1	*	Woth a hockey stick and a can of poutine.
t1_dubi9qc	1	*	But it works extremely well.  
t1_duw1jp6	0	*	It's not hysteria if it's factual.
t1_duweh0h	1	*	i've heard that the best thing a person can do to cut their carbon footprint is not have children. so thats kind of a win win on not having children right? 
t1_dubkjdk	1	*	Divide and conquer.
t1_dulcsj3	1	*	Depends on school board, school itself, and the individual teacher. My religious education in secondary school in Northern Ireland was 'neutral' (not actually neutral) for about a year, everything else was shoehorning in Christian morality and writing out parts of the bible.
t1_duslk38	1	*	Wait, are we getting into an argument over which of our dumb-shit fuck-bags is dumber?  I see your poor drug policy with our own, and raise you high level advisors who have failed background check due to lying MULTIPLE TIMES.
t1_duyyyd8	1	*	Just another business I will now patronize...  
t1_dueqo6m	0	*	British, but yes. (Southern UK is England and Wales (where this event occurred), the Welsh resent being called English. You might as well call all of Americans Nebraskans)
t1_dud3cfv	1	*	The yahoo comments are [something special](https://www.yahoo.com/news/read-muellers-full-indictment-13-russians-charged-election-meddling-191048683.html)  Yahoo was the first place (about 10-14 yrs ago) I noticed going ultra Russian/vile.  Even the news about the new porn star fucking him are russians saying shit like he has good taste. etc.  This one though.. not a peep.
t1_ductie4	1	*	Countries with the death penalty cannot become members of EU. USA could not ever become a member of EU if they do not abolish the death penalty either.
t1_durc7y3	1	*	That's actually how many new things are created
t1_duq7j79	1	*	Cool story bro
t1_duth68z	1	*	I don't get this.  Why are you using chicken head emojis, and what do they have to do with vaccinations?
t1_duxofee	1	*	Most of Japan's whaling is in the southern ocean, near antarctica
t1_duafx48	1	*	Or, you can just write letters
t1_duphpw0	1	*	Keeping wages low and a currency too weak for their economy.
t1_dueq7uj	1	*	Nah, they're testing out the engines. They need to be out of Europe in a couple of months. 
t1_dupfyvf	1	*	That's because they aren't needed.   Most European militaries maintain smaller forces during peace time with manufacturing capabilities for if a war does happen.   There is no need to keep a massive military in place all the time. The US is a rare exception because they seek to maintain global presence. 
t1_duybcag	1	*	Well you should.    I've just come to accept that some government is spying on me, so I'll just buy whatever brand I desire. If I want a Huawei, then the CCP can find out how much I dislike Xi Jinping's latest move. If I want (and am using) an iPhone, then the CIA is about to find out how much I dislike American foreign policy.
t1_dugcw1e	1	*	You're right. There are lots of married men still fuck hookers and lots of married women who still sell pussy.
t1_dun45fb	0	*	That pressure was intense. My heart was pounding each of those 20 minutes. Helluva goalie you guys have.
t1_duwt2nv	1	*	Russia needs coke for the World Cup
t1_dupfhqu	1	*	You are crazy, Germany will need police and military now more than ever, the Islam wars are comming, and they will try to take over with force. I'd put more money in protection and actually protect the people of Germany instead of fucking them over daily.
t1_duh7mzp	0	*	In a prisoners dilemma isnt your best option to always defect? You end up with a higher end score when you defect rather than when you remain loyal to your partner if I remember anything from my class on that in college.   Edit: prisoners dilemma aspect 
t1_duxtli0	0	*	or if a dude sitting nearby didnt wanna smash his balls with his thighs and sat with his legs open
t1_dueb69h	0	*	North Korea isn't slightly poorer and shittier like the GDR was compared to West Germany.  North Korea is literally hell on earth and the poverty is reminiscent of Ethiopia, active concentration camps, and a mass traumatized/brainwashed populace.  There's no way you can ever stitch these two countries back together.
t1_dudwzws	1	*	I'd watch it bring back Eisenberg.
t1_dulikav	1	*	It's funny but the first time I thought I couldn't read. I thought it was striper like the people that volunteer inside a hospital. Had to re-read again to be sure I wasn't crazy
t1_duqbhex	1	*	Gotta love comments like yours accusing people who dont agree with you of being shills to protect your own worldview. 
t1_dul800n	1	*	You need to do a great deal more reading.
t1_duka7oj	0	*	He's been released according to the article, and he was quoted as saying he's still not afraid, so I guess we heard from him.
t1_duylvv3	1	*	Crack is neither a hallucinogen or narcotic.  Since you don't seem to know anything maybe you should sit back and let people who are actually familiar with the subject deal with it.
t1_duqlnyc	1	*	I have to disappoint you, the real world outside your basement  doesn't work that way. Your feelings doesn't matter and throwing empty words will jot change anything. I'm surprised that the same FBI doesn't investigate themself, local pd and the school for letting him do the shooting. But of course leftist are not going to talk about that. 
t1_dueec99	1	*	It's so crazy. ANY other president would have come right out and immediately made a statement to the effect of We must insure our elections are free and fair and without foreign meddling.  But no. TD's eyes start darting back and forth and then he starts shouting, No collusion. No collusion. Sure DT. Sure. 
t1_duo3ntd	1	*	The article literally says it's 45 degree *above normal*.
t1_duqp9ex	0	*	Seriously? Where is that mentioned???
t1_dut1z1q	0	*	As a kazakh, I have similar feelings, brother
t1_duv8tyv	1	*	And somehow all of my family members still love duterte 
t1_dujgrwh	1	*	Obviously Clinton supporters, since she was the only Presidential candidate from the 2016 cycle who previously ran against gay marriage.
t1_dum1kie	1	*	This some /s right?
t1_duz8tnl	1	*	I do believe though that in the packaging world plastic is only becoming more and more popular so I do think we will be living with plastic for a very long time 
t1_dutnmpf	1	*	Despite all the ups and downs with Ebola, dengue, polio, and whooping cough, good old malaria has never left us.  
t1_dubz2dh	1	*	Pretty much. If people are so dumb to believe anything they read they basically deserve to be used like morons they are.
t1_dultp35	1	*	Move to Siberia!  40 acres and a gay for every man!
t1_dug37dw	0	*	I guess they record fingerprints and stuff, so peple cant get the money twice.
t1_duylccd	1	*	I read Trumpists and Russians as Trumpsluts and Russians. Same thing I suppose. 
t1_dugqasr	1	*	A bit rich for Americans to be complaining about election interference, no? You wrote the playbook on this stuff.
t1_dunid8o	0	*	Wow what a well thought out and insightful prediction, and in the 'inb4' meme format we've all come to know and love.
t1_duwczwb	1	*	Was going to write just that. There's merit in this suggestion, if it wasn't for the fact it's all too easy to lable someone a terrorist. So it would take a court ruling declaring someone guilty of terrorism, at which point it's just simpler to have social services act like they would in other situations where child's welfare is at risk.
t1_dum43b4	1	*	PS America, some of us are totally ok with you guys sending freedom here.   
t1_dups9tz	1	*	Thanks god we got those tons of regulations 
t1_duikiwe	0	*	Probably. It's worked for a good amount of Hawaii's plants.
t1_duyjoil	0	*	Doesn't look like he is looking deep into the case as oppossed to desperate to find something that would villify him. So far nothing but no doubt about it, he will keep looking. At this point it doesn't look like he will find anything that will even stick.
t1_duuusqf	1	*	So you are gonna back China fishing ILLEGALLY  in another's country waters just because you don't like that country? That's retarded.
t1_duwemup	1	*	Russian Embassy Chief for Latin America was  [found dead](http://tass.ru/proisshestviya/3890131) with a bullet wound to the head in December 2016. So...yep Edit: This was around same time as when another diplomat, Russia's ambassador to Argentina, allegedly reported the finding of the bags to authorities. 
t1_duwdo0i	0	*	> The Muslim women observed this and told her that she had tainted the cup, because Muslims cant use utensils that have been used by a non-believer.  Erm, that's not true (the bit about sharing utensils), not in my experience anyway.
t1_dubsj3y	1	*	The article states they ate looking to create mid 20% land mass with trees. Curious what the US % is?
t1_dudi887	1	*	SURPRISE! This was at the top of reddit lmao, people give a fuck
t1_duwl8gb	1	*	Yeah, the point of this pay raise would probably be to attract more doctors to the area
t1_duc7qvo	1	*	You should read up on what the dairy industry does to it's cows
t1_durkidx	1	*	look at u/delcielo bringing out all his alts to downvote you
t1_duhwe1j	0	*	So you want to give athletes a worse treatment than other athletes solely based on nationality?  That seems like a stupid thing to do.
t1_dunxug1	1	*	Tell that to the janitor.
t1_duf42b4	1	*	That's fine, but don't get sand in your pussy when one headbutts you and breaks your fucking jaw. 
t1_duuz4rs	1	*	2017 in a nutshell
t1_dullay0	1	*	You mean US based corporations.  The big problem with the TPP was that it gave corporations more power than national governments, US included. 
t1_duhf5qk	0	*	Indeed. The article seeks to deliberately obscure the main culprits, by using as broad terms as possible.
t1_duttzis	1	*	For all we know, autism could be because of the heightened use of aspartame, a genetically modified carrot or birth control hormones. Nobody is really sure. To say it is def because of vaccines seems to be a large stretch.  There is an upswing in autism (although one has to wonder just how many are just badly parented) Anyhow, it could be years before the figure out that something we've assumed was not harmful ended up in our kids DNA make up. 
t1_dugipls	1	*	*Funny* that all of this doesn't  matter. He just says one thing one day, and the complete opposite the next - people simply hear what they want to hear. This way you cater to everyone.
t1_dusjecz	1	*	lmao!!!  You are too far gone
t1_dua25mb	0	*	oh they can, they don't even need access to it... but they don't like to share with others.
t1_dubhouh	1	*	What a great idea, our constitutional order and system of laws should be subject to change based upon whatever shill campaign Russian bots are up to. I can't imagine how doing that could go wrong!

t1_duuicdr	1	*	The upvotes?
t1_dus6vmo	0	*	Still working on budget. RINO's, as have been stated numerous times, are harder to deal with than Dem's.   Sadly, it shouldn't be this hard - it just makes financial sense..   https://i.redd.it/zvbn42lb1kh01.jpg   You guys know that downvoting truth, doesn't change anything right? Petulant children having perpetual temper tantrums. Don't you kids ever change. Such REEEEEEEEE     
t1_dukxs7y	1	*	Its a wash
t1_duvdrrj	1	*	Apart from being fake, this opposition is also only promising what Putin could do better himself. The elections do spark actual debates about relevant political topics. When Putin wins, he can draw conclusions from those and install the ideas he likes. 
t1_dugkcp6	1	*	Exactly.
t1_duselnt	0	*	The problem with idea is that even if you pile on the risks, if someone feels like their home is worth running from the reality of those risks arent as real as the trouble theyre facing at home.   My thinking is that, maybe if we worked to make things better at the places theyre emigrating from (in whatever capacity we see fit as a state), people will be more inclined to stay in their home countries.

t1_dunur6v	1	*	Xi is more authoritarian but he's rooting out corruption in China whereas Trump is implementing it.  You're right that neither are on the level of Putin.
t1_duuaiqu	1	*	Don't forget about the architect of 'privatization' - Anatoliy Chubais, who is somehow not on the sanctions list despite being one of the wealthiest russians, but is suspiciously present on the board of directors of JP Morgan Chase.      Make your own conclusions...
t1_dupx4ve	0	*	> You all can continue saying whatever you want about them, but who have the problem with guns and shootings are you, free to carry guns, but too the right to be shooted.  I have no problem with that, I don't want to live under a nanny state.

t1_dupxy08	0	*	Maybe wait and see where that is over a 12 month period, but yeah this is insignificant.
t1_dunbvdk	0	*	Wait? They aren't armed already? I grew up in a time ermed guards and fucking metal detectors. That was the early 90s.  So where did the protection go?  If we arm them then at least the kids that want to live have a choice to go with the armed ones. How is this bad?
t1_dupnr4v	1	*	Yeah! Why bother investing in a military that can keep the Russians at bay?
t1_duk42qd	0	*	Exactly what I came here to say. It may be to spite him and his position, but he did not do it. Name it something that will not give him the opportunity to take credit for, we all know he will if it is called Trump forest.  To be honest, any mention of him should be detached from it. This is a good deed, dont let him spoil it by twisting the facts to fit his narcissistic view.
t1_duq3eaq	0	*	I support the NRA and their goal to protect the 2nd amendment.  This attack campaign on them being fueled by CNN and others is validation that they need the support of like-minded folks like myself more than ever.
t1_due8flu	1	*	They are still sort of a prisoner and will have to watch their back for the rest of their lives.
t1_duu48tw	0	*	I'm mad at the Russians for what they did to nudge the election to Trump. I'm 100x more mad at the GOP for choosing russian assistance over their own country. McConnell went out of his way to make sure that Obama couldnt do anything about it because to McConnell there is nothing more important than being in power and he will burn this country to the ground for a little bit more. Ryan is just as complict as is the entire GOP. 
t1_duduwm3	1	*	It is all an elaborate mating ritual, or a perversion of it.
t1_duqgykz	1	*	Give it a shot. 
t1_duyv1ld	0	*	That also is a strong-arm populist statement. If SA starves and we have food we should help them out. Even if they actually caused it. It's the humane thing to do. Heck, the people who get the land wont be the ones that starve.

t1_duphboe	1	*	It's pretty sweet. I like it here. 
t1_dudcd6a	1	*	Finally some neutral sense in this thread. If your public is having their voting decision made by Instagram and Facebook, then you need to take a good hard look at where your education system is failing.
t1_dum58lq	1	*	He's either gunna wake up dead or turn up missing.
t1_dusq0iw	1	*	Putin's Russia is the a rogue state 
t1_dubufzh	1	*	But your post wont get upvoted if you don't use Russian in your title and implying that only Russia does this ;)
t1_du9orfx	1	*	Well, maybe it has to do with the quality of the bun, the soda, the fries, and meatballs that you're being fed? It's not like the concept of a cheeseburger is the issue here.

t1_duds89k	1	*	Usually I get super pissed about these drug price gouging stories. But this company just won't sell any when there are two easily produced cheap generics that do exactly what it does. 
t1_dubbuw1	0	*	Russia needed money before the sanctions. You're trying to prove what exactly?
t1_dupay2e	1	*	With sub categories like the rarely won Death by Art teacher etc
t1_dunx7ly	1	*	I think the rampant devotion to capitalism is to blame. As large corporations continue to consolidate power and siphon more and more income from the working class to the top 1%, more extreme methods of control are required. The Western democracies have been entirely co-opted by big money and our political system has become little more than an enabler for big business.   With such an extreme focus on profit at all costs, it only makes sense that the people in charge would be authoritarian. 
t1_duqvjtx	1	*	Dammit, now I'm gagging!
t1_duoufy3	1	*	Absolutely pathetic. Most states in the us acknowledge it except 3 I believe.  Fuck those states that dont. 
t1_duuao3j	1	*	I think history has shown it's not worth the risk.  Maybe extend the term, but always have a limit. Generational turnover is necessary. 
t1_dux0qj2	0	*	Argentinian? You mispelled Chinese.
t1_duqy18s	1	*	Are these disagreement downvotes? The NRA does get a bunch of supporters that make up their base and fight for them.
t1_dua45cx	0	*	It's been a long time since Americans have accepted the killing of children as an acceptable collateral of free gun ownership.
t1_duwjhfu	0	*	It is global warming. Oceans are heating up and ice is slowly disappearing in the arctic.  It's due to CO2 trapping heat in the atmosphere. I suppose that some regions might cool, but I'm not sure that we actually know that it's not a transitionary effect related to the fact that the arctic isn't quite melted yet.

t1_ducucuv	0	*	I'm sure you've heard of the phrase double down, this is like going triple down. Do whatever it takes not to lose face, to the point of delusion, by losing a ton of face. At this point, admitting it is more embarrassing than just keep denying it. At some point, as history shows, the longer you wait, the more people will start denying it again. 
t1_duovhkj	1	*	Russians informed the Argentinean police and they conducted a joint sting.  Spend more team reading and less spamming in all caps

t1_dus6xx0	1	*	Lately? 
t1_dubl7gs	1	*	Their intent is to sow division within the American public on pressing issues thereby eroding unity and confidence in government.  Russia could care less about gun rights in America, it wouldn't be unfathomable if Russian bots promote anti NRA messages at a later point just to keep the controversy going.
t1_dudcpzs	0	*	Wel he was there and fought daesh. Lets start from there. 
t1_duqdken	1	*	When people buy processed food they will have it in pizza dough, packaged bread, margarine, ice cream, cookies, snacks like potato chips and peanuts or somtething like noodles. You'll find it in basically every single instant meal.  I read the label of every shelve product and I will drop anything with palm oil in it doesn't matter if it is a cheap knock off or some major brand. This has to stop. 
t1_durcw4k	1	*	Don't forget the atrocities they commited while they annexed Korea
t1_dupqw8m	1	*	Drug laws and mainstream politicians' mindset about it are pretty backwards still, but otherwise it's great. Education feels very quality over quantity compared to other countries I've been in.
t1_ducxuay	1	*	I swear to god this has to be a bot, new account all post relate to russia and the fucking name lol.
t1_dud5esq	1	*	This isn't proof of collusion. This is an indictment of Russians that meddled in our election cycle and sowed seeds of dissent amongst voters.
t1_dusj5tl	1	*	I find it incredibly intelligent. With the States serving ties and alienating allies this places Putin at an advantage to further his own goals.   Trump was never in it for the people so those under him are screwed. Long as he gets ahead what's ruining a few lives? Country goes to shit, Donald has money to move wherever he wants.

t1_dut7moi	1	*	Mandarin likely won't catch on as a global language. Stick to English French or Spanish
t1_duz6bzy	1	*	To contrast the other commenter, thanks for the insight into our hugely different and scarily recent past. It's fascinating how much things have changed over the course of one lifetime, especially since there is a movement to curve back towards aspects of that past again.

t1_duyj42p	1	*	The room Trump stayed in had been previously used by the Obamas. The prostitutes peed on the bed because Obama had slept in it. It's an extremely childish way to get back at Obama by Trump. 
t1_duyj42b	1	*	That's islam mate, don't generalize.
t1_duciatj	0	*	> it offers what they perceive as plausible deniability  Because the fucking President of the United States told his supporters that it wasn't Russia and they fully 100% unequivocally believe it.  Since this is the case Republican members of congress have 0 reason to change the narrative since it benefits them.  Twitter doesn't give them plausible deniability, Trump and Republicans are doing that for them.
t1_dukv99b	1	*	That is some crazy reverse psychology if you think about it. Imagine 100 years from now people looking at a statue of Trump and telling their kids Thanks to this man the ice caps never melted! He brought the world together and destroyed carbon dioxide that would have roasted us alive!

t1_dun3yit	1	*	The biggest industry providing free plastic straws start next year already. It's a phased roll-out because Taiwan has a huge eat-out population, so they expect very stiff resistance to the change.  Easier to get used to small inconveniences in only one aspect of your everyday life than to suddenly face the same inconvenience everywhere.
t1_duavrdy	0	*	i mean, youd be surprised. in america, scientific literacy is at its all time low. i cant even convince my girlfriend that she doesnt need to buy dayquil capsules on its own since we already have every single component in our medicine bag. but no, its not the same.... U0001f610

t1_duafhux	0	*	Amazon just does everything better. I own an Xbox. Still buy all my games on Amazon because of their insane preorder discount (usually around 20%). They're one of the few big businesses that remembers that competitive pricing makes for less marginal profit, but they still smoke their competition. Amazon best company, 10/10.

t1_dumqd4x	1	*	You'd think the PMO would at least vet the guest list, instead of risking the PM stepping on his own dick during a foreign visit.
t1_duysnm1	1	*	1. If a foreign power has some sort of control over the president of your country, it is in the interest of the citizens, and their right, to know what that is.  2. Yes, politicians are always seeking dirt on their opponents, but usually they don't enlist the help of foreign powers (especially ones who interests are directly opposed to their own country) and if they do, you have to ask whose side they are on and what they are doing in return. 
t1_dukueke	0	*	A bit short of a 400% increase then?
t1_dujsmf8	1	*	Wanting a country to have a bigger military is not exactly hate.  You usually don't want your adversaries to spend more on armed forces.

t1_dupodz5	1	*	Yeah, you can't really look at just Germany and say look how great they're doing and ignore the rest of Europe.  
t1_duja0mb	1	*	Those cost money and power. SA barely has enough power generation for current use. Also the World Bank told Cape Town they should focus on aquifers instead, meaning they wont get a loan for anything else.
t1_duxo55k	0	*	If you actually had a choice then it could be. Policing peoples clothing choices is wrong for any reason, aside from sanitation and safety and whatnot

t1_dulvekv	1	*	Well 200 people protesting is pretty irrelevant if you ask me. They could all be asylum seeker for what it's worth. If you look at the article photo you can see very german like people in the background. /s
t1_dusk5bc	0	*	You know the wall wont be built and if it was, it wouldnt stop illegal border crossing. 
t1_duwaiph	1	*	Watching that movie ages ago and thinking it was cool, but so far away from reality. Boy, does it seem a lot more realistic with the recent turn of events. 
t1_duc7awd	1	*	I fully agree with planting shade trees that lower your A.C. Bill, but that wont have much affect in China. When I was there, most shops and homes would run the A.C. full blast with the doors open. I would be walking down the street and you would feel the A.C. Hit you every time you passed a store front.
t1_dupd7cl	1	*	Decades of social priming?  It was always in vogue between world governments, now the curtain has been allowed to fall because fear has now been calculated to be a bigger deterrent than ignorance.
t1_dukkr7y	1	*	They should have called it Hillary Forest 
t1_duazvcw	1	*	Read the article. They used the same hormone treatment used to induce lactation in cisgender women who have children via a surrogate or adopt.
t1_dua5j30	1	*	> See Australia for example.  Mate we have heaps of guns.  Pls dont be dishonest with us all to push an agenda.
t1_dupw2xz	1	*	>those edits   What kind of person would write this post?
t1_duphg4e	1	*	Well its partly that. It is also partly because they got ahead, the eurozone disproportionately rewards them for being ahead, since they can flood the common market with their products.
t1_dush0qc	1	*	I think you are completely right. I didnt know much about unit 731 so I read about it and I am horrified. Appalled. Embarrassed and ashamed. :( everyone should know about the acts committed there. 
t1_dur7u2q	1	*	It is definitely a joke and has been for as long as I've been alive, and probably longer, but I wasn't there to confirm the shitty feeling I get when I realize how corrupt the system I have to deal with daily is. All the way down to the county and city level.
t1_dumj4io	1	*	i joined the army for reagan
t1_duklb6o	1	*	Didn't Obama say that you couldn't hack an election?
t1_duqij18	0	*	Really? Thought it was a presidential perk to give anyone security clearance of any level at any moment. Oh wait that is true. Nothing to see here folks....
t1_dutahu1	1	*	That would actually be devastasting. The Colosseum is such a beautiful piece of history, regardless of any religious connotation.
t1_dutahuv	1	*	The difference is people who wear turbans arent usually white. They have a problem with white people wearing turbins.   Its like the dreadlock thing, people get angry when they realize no one is required to give a shit about  your culture. 
t1_dui71vm	1	*	A good fit for the job!
t1_dusmv35	0	*	>your going to pay for it you'd kick right off, I know I fucking would!   Absolutely. There is no fucking excuse for using 'your' instead of 'you're'.

t1_dunkov6	0	*	Because of the ban on any kind of (uncoordinated) opposition rallies people are afraid to go on the streets to protest. Also propaganda doing it's job. People are willing to endure a little more time so that better days would come. If not for Navalniy (and I'm not saying that he is a perfect fit for presidency) people would still absorb shit from media doing nothing.

t1_duprt9v	0	*	Maybe actually contribute 2% to of their GDP to defense like they're supposed to under NATO. That would be a nice start.
t1_dueevxa	0	*	I don't believe the Russia fairy tale not because I like Trump, I don't believe the Russia lie because I'm not dumb enough to be butthurt that Hillary Clinton didn't win 1 year after the fact.  As Mel Brooks said, Trump is a song and dance guy.  Anyone who believes a clown like that could be some high-profile spy is sub-retarded.  I'd dare say they were dumb enough to vote for Hillary Clinton, even.
t1_dujddg1	1	*	Yup. From another article on the same site:  >The relations between Russia and western countries including Germany deteriorated in 2014 after eruption of the Ukrainian crisis and Crimeas decision to rejoin Russia.  We need to hold exercises so that we don't accidentally decide to rejoin Russia.

It appears they are looking, and freaking out over, a rain drop when the broken damn is really the issue. 
t1_duse1c1	1	*	Chicago area had 60xb0F last year. Weather apps are telling thats the highest on record.
t1_dutugpm	0	*	The opposition is not underground, it's public, as you can see from this march. They are pretty small though. A lot of Russian people would prefer for Putin to go and someone new, someone younger to come, but most of the opposition candidates are not very bright. Ksenia Sobchak seems to be an exception, she will be running against Putin in the coming election, she is quite liberal in political views and is pretty intelligent as well.
t1_duanco5	0	*	A LGBTQ org at my alma mater decided to start painting H8R with wax crayons or the like on the windows of peoples cars who they thought were intolerant, despite rules stating that vandalism = automatic expulsion. They didn't check their sources well, so to speak, and ended up tagging just as often for petty catfights or personal disputes or pranks.   One day they mixed up and 'tagged' the car of a high-ranking faculty member. That finally did it.

t1_duatn4p	1	*	Literally 3 sentances.
t1_duphwvt	1	*	Well depends if it is suppost to be historical or not. Your not a racist by saying that a historical reenactment is in fact not historical.   If you get triggered by skin colour then I can understand your reaction. But if you want a historical reenactment then it is historicaly correct to use a white French woman.

He could have just fired a couple of shots into the floor to spook the guy AT LEAST. Draw the fire away.  He wandered the halls, knew those kids.

If the company is convicted anyone working with the company can also be banned.    In the future if it is found that someone who's American knowingly worked with them it'll be easier to get a conviction for those people. 
t1_dudv3xj	1	*	No the cost goes down for drugs that actually save lives. Or research goes into underfunded and underserved markets where people are paying 10,000+ for drugs that are almost ineffective. Id rather the profits from a pain killer go towards r&d for life threatening rare diseases as opposed to making the painkiller cheaper. This is a business model, and unless people take advantage of it, it works amazingly well for people in need.

t1_dulr3gv	1	*	It's not just this sub that has an obsession with Trump's diet coke consumption.

t1_duqhh6a	1	*	Probably going to get downvoted to infinity for this, but....  EVERY politician that received funds should be looked at for this. As much as I hate DT, and want to blame this all on shitty leadership from the entire republican party, I'm sure this is a problem on both sides of the aisle.  We truly need to overhaul the way that funds are received for people campaigning for public office. I don't know what the answer is, but it could definitely be better than what it is now.

t1_duveq02	1	*	Just make meat a *part* of a dish, like in virtually every other country.  America is somewhat backwards since meat is dirt cheap, so its usually the main part of a meal.  In most other countries, meat is expensive, so its only an ingredient, and a small amount will go a loooong way once mixed with other ingredients.
t1_duwjn0z	1	*	Legit question - I remember seeing in old pictures that the Thames in London used to freeze enough for people to walk on.  Even though it is really fucking cold right now but it does not seem it'll be anywhere near that.  Feel free to throw some proper technical details at me (I worked on the science of NOx).

t1_dubgt1r	1	*	This is your peak argumentation? This?  You know very damn well that it's likely the russian bots argue for anything on the conservative side simple to foster division.  Another reason could be that Putin knows a political collapse ending in civil war in the US would be an easy win for conservatives who would seize power effortlessly, they picking the winning side.

Lol, head of fresh produce.     
t1_duew4ze	1	*	Gullible Gus over here.

There is no need for pressure when the President is bragging about sexual assault and making claims like climate change was invented by China.

t1_duimryz	1	*	One could argue that the British policy of appeasement pushed Hitler to make more territorial demands and further increase the size of his army. Doesn't mean that WW2 was Britains oops though.  Note that since WW2 doesn't necessarily mean that WW2 was the mistake. It might imply it but strictly speaking it doesn't say it, it merely marks a timeframe.

The study also found that an average of 1,297 children die annually from gun-related injuries, making guns the third-leading cause of death for children in America (behind illnesses and unintentional injuries like drownings or car crashes). The number is based on data taken from 2012 to 2014 for children up to the age of 17.

It will continue to run for essential services (hospitals), government buildings and businesses essential to the economy (guessing banks).  Once the water has been shut down, people will be required to collect their allocation of water (55L?) from around 200 collection points spread around different areas.

You have lied, then lied to cover your lies, then lied to cover those lies you've told.  Eventually the truth comes out and you get found out.  It appears Mr. Trump is in this situation now.

Well, there are several, but the fact that they constantly gloss over or deflect attention from their past atrocities instead of acknowledging them is pretty alarming.

Very young and very old are in big danger, healthy adults have the best chance of survival. Pre-existing immune memory is another big factor.

t1_duq4vuf	1	*	The Mueller investigation has only started. There are plenty more people who worked on Trump's campaign that would have to be looked into. Mike Flynn, George Papadopoulos and Rick Gates pleading guilty in relation to the investigation won't necessarily lead to Trump being impeached.

t1_duduvcn	0	*	I think you, the ATO and the rest of the working population define loss in very different ways. To us loss is when a company invests money and it does not go well for them and incurs a loss. The part that we seem to differ on is you and these companies believe that if you have one tier of your own company lend money to another tier of your own company then that is a loss and you can also charge yourself highly inflated interest rates creating a loss

t1_dughpe4	0	*	This and the same goes for the whole it's all Russia's fault too.   Changes are needed and action speaks louder than internet comments.

t1_duubhuy	1	*	This is why we can't have nice things.
t1_dut8lq5	1	*	10km seems to be the default depth they put up until they get a better measurement, it's changed to 35km now.

t1_dugy2e1	0	*	you're dreaming lol
t1_duc1sxi	1	*	80,000 km2 is quite a lot. It's about 0.8% of China's land area.   2,083,210 km2 is the total area in China that is forested. This project will increase that by 3.8% in less than a year. That's considered a pretty good interest/growth rate.   It's not enough, but it's definitely a great start. And I hope other countries do the same and that China will increase their efforts to fight climate change. 
t1_duyi0mt	0	*	I wonder why no one talks about this when we make fun of American gun laws. 
t1_dugr2al	1	*	And we've apologized on many, many occasions.  Just bear with us, we're just kind of going through a thing right now.

t1_dumnyhp	0	*	California would be higher than you think.  They still have winner take all for the electoral college, essentially giving all the points of the state with the most points to the winner regardless of margin.  So if a candidate wins California by 51 to 49, just about half of the voters didn't actually matter in the end.

t1_duaz1yp	1	*	Oh yeah, you showed them!
t1_duuhk3a	1	*	Also it's pretty easy to design a study to arrive at the conclusion you wanted.    My friend and I might have done this back at uni when we had to do an experiment for general psych so we subtly designed a study to prove that caffeine improves intelligence.   Because our design was good, the data supported the conclusion we wanted. 
t1_duwvjlz	1	*	Like heh. 
t1_dudy4q6	1	*	Single layer lattice.
t1_duacfzi	0	*	DNC didn't make ~4 million voters choose Clinton over Sanders  DNC wasn't responsible for Bernie's poor outreach with minorities and other core Dem supporters during the primaries  DNC wasn't responsible for Hillary having a head start and a large network of donors and people on the ground  DNC wasn't responsible for Bernie's low name recognition before 2016 
t1_dubzkcd	1	*	funnily enough, had this happend in a western country, the military/state would have been sued by several companies for false competition.

t1_dunzi9i	1	*	Probably. Without trying to sound so much like a conspiracy theorist, something something central banks.
t1_dux0yb9	0	*	So a half measure that doesn't do anything except stop the police from arresting people?  Decriminalization has less harm reduction than full blown regulation. I don't get why people think it's a conservative step towards drug reform when all it does is take police out of the equation.   I'd rather decriminalization than nothing, there's still some tax dollars saved and less lives ruined, but illegal enterprise still profits, quality control doesn't happen, people don't get ID'd.

t1_duu0xoj	1	*	there is no way to talk about this shit in Chinese social media at all. I'm just glad Reddit still hasn't been banned yet. though a lot people see this coming, it still scares me. we are doomed.
t1_duj3rjf	1	*	It worked in the US :D  Preventing gay marriage was a platform until very recently, like 2015? I don't think anyone big runs on repealing it but homophobia is still kind of an open wound issue here.  There are still groups trying to protect marriage here, as in keep it between a man and a woman.
t1_duid2im	0	*	All the health reasons they will use are 100% debunked and settled via peer review many times over. They do not listen to reasoning, truth, facts, honesty.
t1_duj6y7q	1	*	I had two gay roommates in college, and one used to dress in drag and would leave his bras on the bathroom floor. It was always interesting to explain when I had a girl over especially.
t1_dusljra	1	*	Well he can then say ok, because technically he releases his taxes (well he made it look like those leaked) but it is just a single page and and from a long ago.
t1_dujjya3	0	*	Yes but politicians like to regulate.  You could also argue that crypto currencies and their exchanges need it if they're going to go mainstream.  When you have banks like Mt. Gox which got hacked and lost a load of bitcoins, so the owners covered it up for a while and then walked off with everybody's money.

t1_dugb20t	0	*	You mean a 12 year old troll is trying to stoke the collusion allegations?
t1_duffqr8	1	*	It it was for health related reasons, then obviously, the operation would be done. It's only in the cases of completely unnecessary operations.
t1_dueaxgp	1	*	I would hope this would lead to an uprising of the productive, throwing off the shackles of the parasite. Hyperbole for hyperbole.

t1_duu8hk5	1	*	I am worried about a new set of wars is coming..  everywhere.. 
t1_dudvgrz	1	*	How about we start with cutting quotas on Russian immigration to zero? I think Democrats could get on board with that.
t1_dumlb6h	1	*	From the article on the death squads, it seems like he has fairly broad support for reducing the crime rate from the triple digits to 8 per 1000 over the course of a decade.  I can't say I would be complaining much about the death squads if I could go outside again.

t1_dusmq6v	1	*	The USA is bombing both the Syrian military and rebels at this point. I think were just trying to chip away at their ability to wage war. You dont have a military as massive as the USAs and not use it regularly. 
t1_ducrvlt	1	*	What's so great?  >Rosenstein said Friday that the indictment does not contain any allegations that any Americans knowingly participated in the activity. There is no allegation in this indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity, he said. There is no allegation in the indictment that the charge conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election.

t1_duhgliu	1	*	They absolutely have an expectation of privacy - the documents / possessions of foreign dignitaries have diplomatic immunity from search and seizure.
t1_duaa7ii	0	*	I was behind them to varying degrees at times but as the 2016 election dragged on it became so obvious (call me dumb but I'd been guessing they were just aiming at the top & they'd switch if she lost). They spam all day about Hilary. OK Shes not great, but they don't have a single bit of dirt on Trump? Not on bad thing to say about him & the shit he does? Asking this got me banned from their sub.

t1_duputms	1	*	It's more likely they realized he was going to lie under oath and had to fire him as a client subject to code of ethics.  Or he stiffed them on fees or couldn't continue to pay.  Switching lawyers at this point in a criminal defense is extremely rare.  It doesn't happen in 99% of cases.
t1_dur8bru	1	*	Right, because having 70% of you GDP in the private sector is socialism.

t1_duklpoi	1	*	> Coincidentally this all happens right after Mueller gives us concrete proof that ~~the~~ Russians were meddling in the election primarily by using fake accounts on social media.

t1_dubmw4u	1	*	Social media is terrible for these kinds of discussions. You have no sense of who you are actually talking to and can convince yourself the boogeyman himself is against you. Weve replaced actual democratic demonstrations with online games of telephone and constant whining. Which red herring will you be fed next?

Donald Trump has stakes out an ideological position that global warming isn't real, and he's the sort of contrarian that, if this were presented to him as a positive idea, he would likely tell the military leadership to implement a preemptive ban on any soldier planting any tree during their term of service. 
t1_duq7s8e	1	*	What whole thing? The NRA has been around 1871. They have been supporting candidates for decades now. 
t1_dudt43i	1	*	Bullshit. And attitudes like yours is why the system remains broken.
t1_duwe0hd	1	*	My kids are going to die or live in hell because fat rich people wanted to be a bit richer before they died and took none of it with them.  It's been utterly heartbreaking.
t1_ducodsx	1	*	I'd like to think so
t1_duxn93g	1	*	wait, I can get Yukon, but what's wrong with PEI?
t1_duly1m8	1	*	I feel like xfdou underestimate the cultural importance of KFC here in Britain. This is a national crisis.
t1_duvz6qh	0	*	-3 here in Herne Bay in England. When it snows here you can be sure the rest of the UK is already several feet under.
t1_duo5120	1	*	America and it's fetish for their constitution is weird from an outside perspective and it becomes straight up bizarre when you bring the 2nd amendment in. Like holy shit if we had the amount of child massacres at the hand of semi automatic weapons that America has my country wouldn't hesitate to go full Australia and just hand them all in and admit we can't be trusted with them.
t1_duxo3wy	1	*	i'd say that's an intentional loophole
t1_duv1cbd	1	*	Might as well just start organizing proletariat militias at that point. 
t1_dura40m	1	*	*cough* *cough* water please.
t1_dulhib4	0	*	That's a tough load to swallow, but it's the truth. Russia didn't create these divides, they merely exploited them. We've been setting ourselves up for this shit for decades now. The problem is...us.
t1_duay9h9	1	*	patient compliance is a pretty serious issue, 70% of hypertension patients don't adhere to their medication according to an Italian study, so it can be understandable that a prime concern for doctors is to make things as simple as possible. Still pretty silly that you weren't given the choice, it's also possible that the brand name medication sponsors the doctor, which is unfortunately common  
t1_dunptx0	1	*	Having a figurehead makes it easier to fling stones, USA policies have ever been the same, ie capitalism first. Trump, Obama, hell even Carter have had as much power in spreading and or curtailing human rights as I have. 
t1_duey81q	1	*	As a brit.. trolololol
t1_dudamdi	1	*	'xc9ste fue como de 7' Guy knows what he's taking about
t1_dum7wp5	1	*	Depends on the schools. Mine was a Lutheran school, and safe to say they gave other religions the bare minimum of attention compared to Christianity.   After being forced to sit through chapel service every morning, listening to our quite homophobic pastor rant, and then eventually forcing prayer during our studying time, I was a bit over it. Add in some insensitivity when it came to mentally ill students, and it was a great ball of fun. 
t1_duruv8y	1	*	Look at the timelapsed satellite images for the last few years - dramatically less ice cover in the summer year on year, which reduces the albedo effect and pushes us into a downward spiral. Anyway Arctic ice isn't the problem as it's just frozen water sitting on liquid water - if the ice sheet over Greenland goes we've got real problems, including massive methane release from the organic material underneath it and a huge volume of additional liquid water
t1_dui96xo	0	*	Assuming you're American. The US has one of the most progressive income tax systems in the world.   The tax rate for the bottom 40% of earners is negative.   The top 20% of earners account for 88%  of the taxes collected.   Unless you are in the top 1% you are not paying a higher rate than the rich
t1_dujhdxb	1	*	Maybe to conserve they should stop pouring water on their Laws! 
t1_duv1fbp	1	*	Its been established his own son is smuggling in the drugs, not killed. 
t1_dudv2g6	0	*	Not sure I'd even call the American system a system.    System implies some sort of planning, control, etc...  What they have just seems wildly out of control to me.  I'm glad we're both on *this* side of the Atlantic!
t1_duw8xm3	0	*	We all die anyway.

t1_duleq2x	1	*	Apparently Filipinos say he was sabotaged.  They literally come up with anything to protect him.

t1_duun1dt	0	*	They did more than that...  > The defendants confessed to marrying Isis fighters or providing the group with logistical aid or helping them carry out terrorist attacks, said Judge Abdul-Sattar al-Birqdar.
t1_dudbuii	1	*	To be fair, its not easy to do something about it
t1_dulerfm	1	*	It was Obama who laughed at Mitt Romney who said russia was a major geopolitical threat saying, The 1980's called and wants their foreign policy back!  I think it was just a year or two later that Russia invaded Ukraine. Man was Obama off the mark with the Russians.
t1_dumcj2x	1	*	So because a past US administration was OK with Marcos then there shouldn't be a change in policy to condemn an anti-democratic leader now? Or should the US never change its policies so people on Reddit can nitpick and find shit to complain about?
t1_dumxgy0	1	*	Because for the us system that is not corruption
t1_dut9pel	1	*	Agreed.
t1_duj2sge	1	*	I had to sponsor Russians football players during the super bowl one year. We had a high school international super bowl in Texas and only the Russians cohabited. Everyone else stayed in hotels. So.. I guess its a real possibility?

t1_duhgbvs	1	*	I bet the protocols have stepped up over the years however and an aide wouldnt miss a motorcade. I bet its because North Korea and China are close. Incase of attack Tump having access to the briefcase would be important chip in Negotiations. 
t1_duhgbv0	1	*	I was diagnosed at 25. I got through everything before that but knowing earlier would have saved an awful lot of needles greif.  Like most mental illness simply knowing what's broken and how that's likely to cause problems helps an awful lot. Going undiagnosed is like having a broken leg but never knowing that it will get worse if you walk on it.
t1_dusz45f	1	*	Just remember that the first bans came in 20 years ago, so while the number of guns has gone up again over that time, so has the population. Per-capita gun rates are still lower than 1997, which is the important number.
t1_dum7ab5	1	*	> How can her goverment survive that?  Not for very long. So much is certain.
t1_dusqclu	0	*	It's not like anyone is gonna do anything about it anyway. UN is still sleeping.
t1_dusy4u7	1	*	Coming Soon: US vs. North Korea, Putin invokes national emergency, scraps limit on presidential term to maintain stability, never reinstates limit, dies aged 120 and gets his own tomb in Red Square.
t1_dubz5ys	0	*	Russian propaganda.  Germany allying with Turkey is a seperation from UK and US interests.  Also German...but they are going to prey on ignorance like they did in Brexit, the US election and other European elections and nations(*cough* Ukraine *cough.*)
t1_duf268s	1	*	It's obviously bullshit but the US regime has realized it's a great excuse to impose social media censorship.  War is peace, slavery is freedom, ignorance is strength.
t1_duoqyv1	1	*	[One of the locals was interviewed about this discovery.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3PbdyJ_ybSI)
t1_dum3qpm	1	*	Your comment is like saying it's a concern that spies spy. I mean they literally do this with everyone, it's part of their job to label people and to assess their risk.  I'm not a fan of the US but it seems ridiculous that them labeling him is a concern to geopolitics.. ffs
t1_duczqga	0	*	> I wonder how many of the comments on this post are from the troll farm.   All those you disagree with.
t1_duwgxox	1	*	With all respect, that's not how Europe works. Plus, Europe isn't a nation, and while individual nations held some land in Africa, the entire continent wasn't divided between European powrs until the end of the 19th and start of the 20th centuries.
t1_dul8bzp	1	*	My religion class in secondary school literally was an indoctrination class, however. My teacher showed us a video in which a minister explained to us that, if we didn't accept Jesus Christ as our saviour, we would burn in hell for eternity.  I have absolutely no problem with students studying world religions, however.
t1_dugg0b5	0	*	Nice. Saudi Arabia is heading in the right direction. You country might as well soon.

t1_dupsofn	1	*	It's easy to get a surplus if you exploit an economic union with many smaller nations for your own goals. 
t1_duupp9x	0	*	Given how stringent and tough the vetting process is for choosing successors within the Communist Party is (if you didn't know, successors have been traditionally groomed 5 years before taking office), I can hardly imagine a new Donald Trump-like leader being chosen.   Xi may choose to groom a crony of his for succession after his retirement/death but I can hardly imagine that the crony would be incompetent. 
t1_dunoyhx	0	*	Yes, tech company Blind use is a combination of dick measurement contests and white males with persecution complexes venting their political frustration through trolling.  You always have to ask yourself what kinds of conversation you'd desire anonymity for, and the answers are rarely good.  There's some genuinely useful talk that happens from time to time, enough to keep me checking it now and then, but man is the signal to noise ratio awful.
t1_duviyxu	0	*	Tbf the Aussie tourists in Bali are awful and give zero fucks about the environment
t1_dupbr7b	1	*	Exactly. Which is why they didn't have anything more than guns. Some nobody going to give these village bumpkins anything serious, besides AKs. Hope this sends a message to other aspiring adventures

t1_dukwx39	1	*	Saw this in Taiwan.
t1_ducksqm	1	*	All she's saying is that people who dress up look more professional then people who don't.  A man in a suit looks smarter then a man in a T-shirt. Psychologically when arms are covered by men or by women they appear more intelligent; at least that's the claim.  This isn't new information, nor an issue about modesty; nor news worthy.   
t1_duto8ux	0	*	You do know that the anit vax movement is stronger in your continent than it is in NA, right? Measles have been eliminated in the Americas.  I'm not sure why you people have such a superiority complex. It makes no sense.

t1_dun9int	1	*	next south park episodes could be funny. or not if you think about it. 
t1_dupnbva	1	*	There is oil though. But China owns a considerable amount. xa0In 2006, thexa0China National Petroleum Corporationxa0upgraded the Khartoum refinery, doubling its capacity to 100,000xa0barrels per day . So probably not a good idea to start a proxy war with China. 
t1_duq1p42	1	*	I think you mean to say yankee scum, budday
t1_dui8m9k	1	*	The smart wealthy can smell the blood in the water. They need an FDR 2.0 in order to keep their absurd wealth, otherwise they can just read a book on the French Revolution, the Bolshevik Revolution, or the Cuban Revolution, to name a few.

t1_dubr4g0	1	*	Reported for botting 
t1_dumkce5	1	*	User name checks out.
t1_duzjafb	1	*	Wow. That's investigative reporting.
t1_dupos8v	1	*	Tbh, no one has a claim to complain about their economy and saying they should invest in military. Clearly -- and we have the evidence right here -- they don't need any of that anymore. Besides, we fight wars differently now. It doesn't  have to be the overly bloated and outdated expenses that some countries have for their military (i.e. the U.S.).
t1_dukwglq	1	*	This is not far from the truth likely or not. When I was younger an ex told me the local cops arrested her and gave her two options. We beat you or we rape you. She had to choose option one. I dont remember being surprised at the time also. 
t1_duvto28	0	*	Which is stronger: the neck of a disease-addled meth head or Trumps tinyhands?  Legitimate question.  ^^/s
t1_duumfdf	1	*	Shorter, actually. The ocean is closer to the core than the atmosphere, so it's going to have a lower milage to traverse a given arc. Assuming you move in a straight line the whole time. 
t1_dui1obv	1	*	There were quite a few posts about it a week ago when the police recommended the indictment, and the newspapers here have had Bibi related articles on the front page since as well.  What's your point exactly, besides showing how ignorant you are?
t1_duqcsky	1	*	They're being very careful about that, there's a lot we haven't seen yet for this very reason.
t1_dupkhfj	1	*	Quite funny. Your joke gave me a chuckle.

t1_dui2qyx	1	*	says you commenting on reddit.com
t1_dui2qyz	1	*	The data in the article is from 2007-2014.   You might want to start actually *reading* articles instead of just spouting off lazy platitudes about baby boomers based on the headline. 
t1_dunbx25	1	*	To make the transition smooth. It would be bad for both business and people to suddenly ban a product as widely used as plastic straws.
t1_dupvrm4	1	*	The vaults have been untouched. There trickled water into the entrance. It had been fixed a year before the press fit hold of the story.
t1_duifvl9	1	*	First they came for the iPhones and I said nothing because I had an Android phone.  Then they came for the consoles and I said nothing because I had a gaming PC.  Then they came for the avocados and no one was left to say anything because we all died from eating detergent.
t1_duwaiiz	1	*	It's still not too late to minimize the damage by a lot.
t1_duaekev	1	*	Slightly wrong. On an a legal definition yes this is the case. Actually though Kremlin uses oligarchs to commit acts on it behalf then it can plausibly deny. in this case it got an oligarch to work with Manafort and the escort filmed the debriefing of him to a Kremlin official. You cant be an oligarch anymore if you dont work for Kremlin.

t1_ducbq16	0	*	100% this - UBI is absolutely necessary for the future of society. Not even just because of automation, it's the only natural progression at this point - except for people who prefer regression, of course.

t1_duuhb4l	1	*	That needs to become a term
t1_dubl9zy	1	*	I've started doing this, too. There are people clearly being disingenuous or pushing a willfully ignorant thought process and I find it's best to not engage.  I'm not saying I'm successful on here.  In fact, most of my political posts on here I immediately regret. 
t1_dubi72b	1	*	Motherfuck!

t1_dubomja	1	*	Nah I'm definitely a human.
t1_dum6iiv	1	*	it'd cause uproar and huge protests probably
t1_duj7tkl	1	*	To be fair, Putin is not mentioned in it at all. It just urges people to vote.
t1_dupb5kp	1	*	To be fair, I'd be surprised if many Americans ate much bluefin at all. Even of those who really enjoy going out for sushi, I would say yellowfin is vastly more common for tuna. Over the span of 10 years I've had bluefin toro maybe 2-3 times.
t1_dukfgp3	1	*	Because galvanizing around a cause like this makes your combination of voices heard. Its not going to change anything - but it helps get the message out that there are thousands (millions?) of global citizens who disagree with this decision. Peaceful protest. 
t1_duwrntn	1	*	If fiction is bad, you can change the channel or put down the book. In real life, all you can do is buckle up.
t1_duk4doa	1	*	Like UK had a plan for London's congestion..by..what did they do? Ah, cut a whole lane in some areas, resulting in even more congestion.  Please, UK as it is today couldn't plan something even if they stumbled over a secret German plan werk.
t1_duqmylw	1	*	Ok, that was pretty good.
t1_dupjgi4	1	*	You know that the 2% are not payed to nato right. The 2% is the goal for their internal military budget so even if they would increase the ~1.3% (~$47 billion) to the goal of 2% none of that money would go to the USA or NATO. The money would be spent on solders and military equipment in Germany/Europe most likely. No savings for the US of any kind.

t1_duqbipv	1	*	This is exactly what the Disclose Act was intended to fix. Who stopped that? Gee, I wonder... Hmm...   These PACs can get all the money they want from anywhere, and nobody can check their books. Sure, its illegal to use foreign money to finance US political campaigns, but its impossible to police. Plus, once you have the money, its not like theres a from China stamp on it. Its just money. 
t1_dumln29	1	*	No blame having kids out of wedlock (by this I mean not in a committed relationship akin to a marriage).  The chance of a two parent household being in poverty vs a single parent household is drastically different.

t1_dugzu2e	1	*	I believe its accidental causes and illness, which is pretty much nonsense. Accidental causes is a pretty huge category that can include just about anything. I don't have current numbers, but in the recent past there were about 9000 fatalities for car crashes and something like 3500 drowning fatalities. These are grouped under one category.  Don't get me wrong, it's still terrible that kids are victims of gun violence, I just can't stand how the media puts out this nonsense.
t1_dur5ihn	1	*	They'd be blamed for imperialism just as USA was after the Vietnam intervention. And Nicaragua. And Iraq. And Syria. And Libya.  Removing dictators that slaughter and starve their people doesn't sit well with left-leaning people.

t1_duijp24	1	*	The fact they are suppressing the news about it sure makes it not suspicious.  Last paragraph here: [Barnett predicted Chinas bid to suppress news of the blaze  by censoring online posts and forbidding locals to broadcast images of the fire or gather near the temple  would further hurt relations with Tibetans. It has restimulated the dominant tone in Tibet  which is intimidation really.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/feb/18/jokhang-temple-fire-engulfs-ancient-heart-of-tibetan-buddhism)

t1_duz4cp9	0	*	Thailand has some really shady selectively enforced licensing programs in the name of public safety that are in reality just a protection racket.  It's a beautiful place but I've heard that same story from two different kinds of businesses while I was there (a climbing shop and a bike rental shop) and I'm sure prostitution is no different.
t1_duf1zon	1	*	How? 1. They make up lies . (e.g. the Clinton's run a pardophile ring) and present it as fact. 2. They do this to stir up anger and hatred. 3. They repeat and spread the lies so that they are everywhere and people start believing them because they don't know what is true anymore.  Yes. Some people **do** live their lives on Facebook.
t1_duplebb	0	*	Objectively this final is the biggest achievement of this years olympic Games. Huge success, especially beating two top Teams.  Edit: from german perspective of course.

t1_dulm7g6	1	*	If you have a healthy immune system, the chances of you getting full-blown measles is astronomically low. However, being vaccinated doesn't prevent the virus from infecting you, it just makes you better at fighting it off, so it wouldn't be surprising if some people get a low-grade fever from it for a day or two. If you're elderly or have to take immune suppressants, or even if you have a bad flu at the time, then it can still be serious.

t1_dupfbaz	1	*	Can you imagine cops chasing after young black men trying to teach them Pythagorean theorem?
t1_duow1ao	1	*	Not just the stock market, but every kitchen as well. Not to mention the kitchomen and kitchildren. 
t1_dudxbz1	1	*	Alot of the major drug company's are in Ireland for the low tax. It's all shipped around the world from there then.  It's how we have free healthcare under a certain salary.
t1_dumh8yy	1	*	I'm acquainted with a bunch of Filipino Americans. They were very optimistic about him at first, but now I think they've mostly realized he's a fraud.
t1_dunc6x7	1	*	South Park called a lot of shit because they're not afraid to show the obvious outcome of something stupid. That's the cool thing about not being a partisan fuckboy, you can objectively look at both sides and call them out of their shit.
t1_dudgmlj	1	*	[Not really](http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/10/28/woman-buys-thief-groceries-after-steals-her-wallet.html). We just don't feel the need to constantly tie these episodes of goodwill into a look how great our nationality is headline.
t1_duq35v0	1	*	> disbanded Nascar years ago  IS a nice way of saying southern gun owners vilgilantying them. 
t1_dus80hz	1	*	ITT: let's invade neighboring Asian countries and mass murder their population and not expect any repercussions
t1_duk3wnx	1	*	It's a cult. 
t1_dusy9p3	0	*	How about they put a clause in that Xi and no one else would be president for life. Also make it mandatory for everyone to have a picture of him in their homes. And make school children sing songs praising Xi. And put everyone who opposes him in labor camps or murder them straight away.  Wait, this all sounds familiar. Where have I heard this before?
t1_dua2u86	1	*	You're full of shite, because the Common Foreign and Security Policy is intergovernmental and foreign policy is not even a supporting competence of the European Union.  What you are quoting is just coordination and defense of EU interests.
t1_dud07uc	1	*	Bernie would have won tho
t1_duib5pe	0	*	I watched the documentary, and every Brit shares about 10% of DNA with his group, which is the Western Europe Hunter Gatherers. I wonder if having blue eyes make you more related to his group.
t1_duvb3qq	1	*	To be fair, I wouldn't do drugs if I knew it'd get me shot and killed.   Sometimes ruling with an iron fist works despite it being absolutely horrendously cruel. 
t1_duyz1zj	1	*	Somebody like Muller would most likely have a dead mans switch for such a situation.  At least I hope.
t1_duke2qk	0	*	Ignoring the welfare check bit. Please tell me what you would do with refugees, if your were leader of a european country.
t1_dun11c7	1	*	Exactly 
t1_dutbvo8	1	*	That would require saying that the national debt matters. Which would put a damper on the tax give-aways and the massive spending plans they have...so its been pretty quiet on the hill.
t1_duix8og	1	*	> fed information to russians... And where does it say that? It doesn't.  Try and assess whether a publication has an agenda. (It's not difficult)  Try and use your critical faculties to see if there are any actual facts in there to back up your statements. (Not too difficult if you have a modicum of intelligence.)   Then you might be able to contribute with meaningful comment rather than just spreading conjecture and innuendo as fact.

t1_duvmkfz	1	*	I went snorkeling in Bali about two years ago and it was pretty good, but the reef was very obviously in a substantially worse condition that it was the previous time I went (about 10 years ago). The trash was also a huge issue this time around

t1_dubjaby	1	*	Brings a whole new meaning to keyboard warriors 
t1_durrmcn	1	*	Well that works all and well in a place where they actually undercut the dealers. Not all Weed laws are created equal. I live in Canada and when they legalize it in my province, it will be more to buy it legally then to keep using a dealer. In comparison I pay 80 for 14g and the gov will be charging 140+ tax
t1_dufkvjb	1	*	I think that the problem is that religious freedom isn't really defined.  The way I see it the most important part of religious freedom is fredoom FROM religion.  The original meaning of it was that no king can come and say that you must have belief X, today, it's usually not kings that say that you must believe X, it's parents.  One aspect of this lack of freedom from religion is when parents can can cut off parts of their kids in the name of their own religion.
t1_duanria	1	*	Peniston oils
t1_dum3gh4	0	*	Were they democratically elected with a clear plan which they stuck to?  Trump: No Duterte: Yes  Duterte wins the heartless asshole competition *and* the following through on campaign promises competition.

t1_duj8e1c	1	*	We also have reports of dogs and cats eating human remains after national disasters. It doesn't mean wolves have a particular taste for human flesh lol.

t1_duwd8b2	1	*	A batman army is badass
t1_dubzfir	1	*	But what would trump do without twitter?
t1_dui9k49	1	*	Despite the general perception, there is an inverse relationship between wealth and philanthropy. They do give. More often, and for larger amounts than most every one else.   But even more so than that, history has shown that the government would probably squander the money anyway. I think more people would be open to the idea of being taxed more in general if they knew basic necessities for life were provided. 
t1_dugmpo5	1	*	cbd is currently legal so he wouldnt need a license, only for THC would he need a license
t1_dupkuq2	1	*	We have a huge Investment bottleneck in education, infrastructure and digitalisation. Especially rural areas lack behind when it comes to internet connection.  Also our nursing sector is massively underpaid and undervalued.  There are many places to spend and invest this Money. But debt reduction is also important.
t1_ducu9so	0	*	Peanut butter is by the way incredibly easy to make yourself. You just need a mixer/mortar sugar, salt and that's it. That's all incredibly cheap and it tastes much better if it's fresh made. If you pay 5-6 dollar on a jar it will probably be even cheaper after a short period of time. 
t1_dupjpwc	1	*	Save it for when there's an economic downturn so they can invest in the economy. The way Keynesianism is supposed to be done but everyone forgets about the not spending bit....
t1_duaef2k	1	*	The thing about contagion is that well...the disease wasn't exactly that deadly. Certainly not enough to cause the breakdown in society shown. Less than one percent of the US, .7% I believe, and .3% of the worlds population in total.
t1_dus713k	1	*	I dont think thats fair... Op tried his best: Was it good enough: Was it a reasonable effort: Only time will tell
t1_duq6bxq	0	*	There are legal constraints, but there is also the damage that unethical behavior might do to a company's reputation in the marketplace. If VW were to continuously engage in unethical behavior, eventually their sales might suffer.

t1_duds3wd	0	*	It's sad to hear a victim be happy for their loss. Like a man who's eyes have been removed  being pleased he can't see rainbows and get distracted.     The fully intact are outraged on your behalf as you cannot conceive what you are missing. 
t1_duq8qjw	0	*	Because there isnt actually proof, just more left wing speculation
t1_dua8x7u	1	*	The only other Russian presidential candidate and only person with the balls to run against Putin came out with a video highlighting Putins political maleficence (and speaking of his interference in the US election if I recall correctly)
t1_dua8x79	1	*	They probably won't use a knife, they'll probably use a bomb or just a truck.  See multiple cities in Europe for examples of the latter.
t1_duvgh02	1	*	It isn't hard to do. Declaring something illegal unless you adhere to some strict guidelines is super fucking effective. Sure you'll have a few people using crypto personally, but exchanges won't be able to operate.  There you go. Your revolutionary currency is on its arse. Nice try. 
t1_dujjr29	1	*	Actually, Politifact is doing a pretty good job of keeping a running tab on every time Donald Trump prevaricates.  http://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/  **Edit:** Downvotes by those in denial or disagreement (or disgruntled Trump Trolls) do not refute or impugn either the statement or the linked article substantiating it.
t1_duclse3	0	*	Pardon my arrogance as I dont normally discuss this topic or enjoy arguing on the Internet.  But if someone is too incompetent to handle personal finances... wouldnt that person also be a bit too incompetent to handle deadly weapons?   Id much rather have a person with a gun in front of me who can handle their own budget over the one who cant do math and cant manage their own life.

t1_duosm8r	1	*	Yeah, if he was wearing a tan suit that would be one thing....
t1_duplh7f	0	*	Fingers crossed Ramaphosa can fix the economy though. Hopefully he'll also cancel the nuclear deal. Without gross corruption and a bit more efficiency in public spending South Africa wouldn't be that far off from closing the deficit.   Unless the ANC decide to bribe everyone again to vote for them... Eish! 
t1_duuppf5	1	*	Pure water has chemicals in it, and 100% of people who drink it die.
t1_duhtsq4	0	*	No, this is not even close.  W. handed out checks hoping to stimulate the economy, Singapore had an excess of cash (a surplus) and decided to give it back to the people.  Surplus vs. Stimulus.
t1_duc41cr	1	*	$79.5mil for the townhouse
t1_dul6b0n	1	*	Is he though? It's  race to the bottom for people like Trump, Erdogan and Putin. Sometimes I wonder if we're living in a spin-off of Super-Troopers where the different regime leaders bet with each other who can say and do the dumbest shit for the longest.    If Trump ever says 'meow' more than twice in an interview I'll know its true and that we've entered the dimmest timeline.
t1_duhs6bc	1	*	Agree they are trouble makers
t1_dup6tyv	1	*	What irony? Are you saying intolerance against intolerance is intolerance?  
t1_dugr988	1	*	They are unless they're not as directed by the president unless Sanders says otherwise except when trump is cornered unless he was joking

t1_dusingn	0	*	The strong do as they please and the weak suffer what they must. Maybe Mexicos predominantly Spanish descended ruling class should do something to help its zambos and Indios rather than taking cash from CIA backed cartels 
t1_duhfifv	0	*	Why are you sure it won't be faster next year? And why does it matter that it's faster now than the 90's? That's not much of a surprise.
t1_dujr9hr	1	*	Well part of the problem is the conflation between russian interference, collusion with the Trump campaign, and the actual hacking of voting machines.   So far only the first has been proven, but the media keeps them all under the same umbrella. 
t1_dui9by6	1	*	Hes not really active in ms any more and these days they are pushing edge the replacement of ie

t1_dujbgqt	1	*	You'd be a damned tin foil hat wearer it's what they do to marginalized defame people that expose them, its to deflect their crimes.

t1_duwl44z	1	*	Word!
t1_dun9csv	1	*	Well, good job on being an idiot then!
t1_dujlwt7	1	*	except the quote provided by politifact isn't a contradiction.  he said this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story, referring to the allegation that he colluded with Russia.  he also said Russia has always meddled in the election, just like other countries do.  i'm struggling to find the contradiction, but of course, i actually paid attention this election, so that puts me at a disadvantage i suppose.
t1_durrgl5	1	*	SC too. it's disgusting
t1_duvuen4	1	*	Funny thing is Persian society was more democratic and multicultural than Spartan society, which was ruthless, impersonal, and far less concerned with individual liberty. Spartans also owned slaves. 
t1_dufdjdd	1	*	We're having a good laugh at Trump being the president of the Americans though, even if the Russia conspiracy still sounds far fetched.
t1_duhld9h	1	*	Nothing? That's just the beginning of the study. 
t1_dud0dob	1	*	Basically That's it? Some russians tweeted?
t1_dut00zi	1	*	After Mao's death the country changed to a more decentralized structure to make ruling and change of rulers easier. Now this changed with Xi and he's aiming for a Mao level of one man rulership.
t1_dulc0yd	1	*	Visionary, and detracts the association to anyone who isn't a moron by providing a negative association to the Trump name. I second this change in name.  Why are you getting angry messages when in comparison. the name it has now can be far more easily misconstrued to paint Trump in a positive light?
t1_dui3i8n	1	*	Finally someone said it! If these kids would just stop getting new phones the whole economy would be fixed!

t1_dubn4re	0	*	End game? I'm going to say that democracy does not matter. If Russia can make a bad example out of the US, we effectively lose our power on the global stage.   Well, if the U.S. can fall/fail. Then so can the rest of the world. Democracy becomes pointless, the world becomes hopeless. This Putin's game.   This country may fall, alright. *But we fall, so we can learn to pick ourselves up.*

t1_duwswq1	1	*	Lol. The only government which doesn't seem decidedly mafia like is the Icelandic government - and that's because they just canned their entire crew a few years ago, and started over.  The rest of us dumb schmucks are still wallowing in several hundred years worth of accumulated corruption.

t1_duat712	1	*	Yes they did
t1_dupr1hj	1	*	The roles were reversed thousands of times in 2017. Its actually probably one of the root causes of this over aggressive behavior by the police. Paranoid behavior and over reaction. This is the result. The guy could have been going on a Sunday jog and the result would be the same. The police know there is a history of them being targets of attempted murder, they see someone running at them, they do what they can to stop it, and then they took it too far.

I think the issues lie with patent laws in conjunction with free market capitalism.   Companies can only remain competitive if they have competition, how do you create the competition if no one else is allowed to compete with a similar product?

t1_dulo786	1	*	Another example from Sweden;   With a rebate I can get an ADSL connection of 12-30 Mbit/s down for $35 or at full price $55.   I just noticed this new offer on my ISPs site and actually currently I'm using up to 8 Mbit/s which is about 6.5 Mbit/s on a sometimes not so functional line, for only slightly less if I remember correctly.  Mobile stick internet is limited amount per month and bad coverage. Fiber is not yet available at all, but we've paid to have it installed and it's on the way.
t1_duaj59m	0	*	So you're holding Japan up as a great place and criticising folk vote wanting to be like it?  That is one very confusing post. I'm not sure even you can get the gist of it.

t1_dufjvqc	0	*	This is no slight on you, but entertain is a funny euphamism. I've never said sleeping with you was very entertaining.   The escorts are there to be fucked, not juggle.   Edit: Yeah, okay, I was going for George Carlin and wound up being more Neil DeGrasse Tyson. My bad.

t1_duwbfy6	1	*	Is China so short on competent people that they'll crumble without this one specific individual holding on to the reins of power? Is China that weak and unstable? Obviously not. This decision has nothing to do with what is good for China. It's all about him. We've also been through this same process a hundred times already and the end results are never good. His unwillingness to give up power will lead to escalating actions to hold on to that power against threats both real and imagined.

t1_duicxjq	1	*	More people need to contemplate a simple question.  Were Hillary and Trump the 2 best candidates the country had to offer?        I doubt anybody can answer yes to that.  Because we have a broken 2 party system that coordinates with media to spew propaganda to the masses pushing unqualified candidates and excluding third parties.

It shows the value of potential gdp, as in the ppf curve, and where their real gdp is at. Whether it's on the curve, at Max potential gdp. A point inside the ppf, or below potential gdp. A point outside the ppf, or producing more than their potential gdp.

t1_dusvqe8	0	*	This administration has achieved exactly dick along with the last two administrations.  North Korea has *always* said they are open to talks.  These talks just mean DPRK making absurd demands, offering no concessions, and serving as nothing more than propaganda for their own people.
t1_dus2aum	0	*	You've got to be kidding. He set us back 10 years just by pulling out of the Paris Agreement. Now our kid's generations are going to have to deal with this mess and he doesn't give a shit. He's a puppet for lobbyist and corporations that DON'T want us to focus on clean energy/reducing our carbon footprint. Fucking ridiculous. And, now, China and India will lead in solar energy leaving us behind. There goes any chance for the US.

t1_dusqwyp	1	*	I often see his supporters cite his wealth as evidence of his intelligence.  But... he's just a person who was born incredibly rich, right? He was born to a real estate millionaire. His life is such that enormous wealth is a guarantee, not an achievement. But it seems some people feel being rich is a reflection of some innate personal quality, instead of an environmental factor. It's weird.

t1_dudkoy0	1	*	You are still in the anger stage, and the edgy last sentence is a bit much.  If EVERYONE at the same time behaved in this manner, yes it would work.  However, you have to think practically about change like this.  It will not come quickly.  I know that sounds somewhat defeatist, but you cannot expect everyone to come around at once.  This war must be fought with good ideas.
t1_dul4uw7	1	*	Also jeez... get some perspective. Raw dogging someone doesn't lead to VD unless you're sleeping with a skank. Try slowing it down a notch and IDK get a VD test before you fuck a stranger. The whole don't wear a condom.

t1_dugzm7y	0	*	Illness is a perfectly valid statistic. All kinds of illness are rolled into one stat. In other contexts, you can then break that stat down further. Here, its less relevant. Would you want deaths from guns broken down by caliber?  We used to tally DNBI in the military - Disease and non-battle injury. 
t1_duxaqgu	1	*	If youre at home smoking buddha on your own dime, why should you be scared of being arrested?  Why should police sirens cause somebody to react when you aren't harming anybody?   The threat of arrest is put there to prevent people smoking or attaining this stuff in the first place. But if youre already a pothead, it just creates paranoia and forces you to behave in a shady manner, meeting people in unlit alleyways and hiding stuff on your person. 
t1_dusmh5f	1	*	Yet something tells me this sort of situation is only possible due to their outstanding transportation systems like the subways, rail lines, bullet train, busses etc.  Here in the states the distances are so abysmal I'm sure people would rather die than not drive.

Probably the most racist people I have came across and I live in Texas and lived and traveled throughout the deep South. I'm not a fan of their people and culture at all.
t1_duxcmfi	1	*	We just need to convince the Japanese it was chicken and cow who bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and not Doruphin and Whareu and Barue Fin Atuna.  FUCKA YOU DORUPHIN, FUCKA YOU WHAREU, AND FUCKA YOU BARUE FINA TUNA.

t1_duh9wbr	1	*	Most Americans that voted for him and couldn't see him for what he was are unAmerican for continuing to support him. I'll forgive their lapse in judgement on election day or visceral feeling of needing change, they're just misguided as to who's fault it is (rich people, not immigrants or gays or blm or antifa or whatever boogeyman this month). I cannot forgive them carrying-on like nothing is wrong.

t1_duzaued	0	*	Beg your pardon if this is a supremely ignorant question(s), but what good is Mueller asking these questions? If Mueller somehow has proof that Trump is giving false answers, is that all it will take to indict Trump? If he is indicted, does it matter what for? In other words, if he is indicted for... say, conspiracy, rather than treason, does this have any greater or lesser impact on the potential for getting him out of office? Is any indictment effectively the end of his presidency?

t1_dubn1ab	1	*	Why would Russia need to divide you when your government and every other residing system inside your country does that for you? From politics to sports to even education, they seem to be doing a good job without any outside intervention. Try and paint it all black and white when everything's grey.  Is that why the American flag is everywhere so that people don't forget they're still all just American?

t1_dujdy8s	1	*	Because it is? A majority of Russians do want him for president. Yeah, you might disagree with him but his people like him.
t1_dut5d7f	1	*	Import more people who hate Western culture, probably.
t1_duriyle	1	*	When wasn't America doing either of those things?
t1_duyz5nm	1	*	I think the picture is intentionally taken like this to highlight the contrast. The article says they're rolling out the single-aisle model to all their supermarkets, maybe they simply need a testing site before converting the rest? There's a supermarket in Berlin (https://original-unverpackt.de/) without any packaging....
t1_dumt64e	1	*	Lol, this has got to be a trollacvount right?
t1_dug8pyh	0	*	The investigation thus far proves otherwise. Until the investigation says otherwise, what you said is heresay. 
t1_durul2t	1	*	And Japan needs to understand that there is a direct correlation between their refusal to surrender, unconditionally once they were completely surrounded and cut off from the outside world and the two bombings that ultimately led to their unconditional surrender.  The aggressor in a conflict such as WWII absolutely does not get to dictate the terms of their surrender -- As they eventually learned.
t1_dua7fx7	1	*	The same group of people that claim to need guns to overthrow a tyrannical leader are the ones who embrace our current tyrannical leader.          A bit ironic,  isn't it?

t1_durpmx4	1	*	The irony is that now it'll probably happen.  Not because it's a good idea to prevent this or that from being forgotten but because it would be a direct answer to what is, frankly speaking, a political move on the part of Japan's conservative government.
t1_duf72d9	1	*	Essentially to create enough dissection within America to weaken our power internally.   Russia has known for a long time that they could not beat us in a straight war unless it was in a Asia. But if they created enough strife internally they could bring us down internally without having to fire a shot.   There is a quote from a Soviet leader that I will post as an edit.

I'm not even a fan of political parties, but I do know that there are many libertarian-leaning candidates who aren't in politics for their own benefit. Not to say they wouldn't change once they got a taste of power, but in general I think choosing people of any party or affiliation who *don't* want the power are the types of people we should be supporting. Ultimately, their party doesn't matter, their character does.
t1_dup7nql	0	*	Because Turkey is a baby having a hard time coming to terms with their own history. Every time their massacre of Armenia gets called what it is (genocide), Erdogan starts throwing a tantrum calling everyone nazis, fascists, racists, etc.   It would be hilarious if it wasnt so goddamn pathetic.

t1_dubvq46	1	*	What has manufacturing in third world countries got to do with trying to access the the future largest market of the world?  Manufacturing in a third world country doesn't help you sell products to China.

t1_duk7ieg	1	*	Its.not.just life support. Think about that statement, and what it entails. Think about all the bodily processes that have to be performed and all the proffessionals required 24/7 to keep the machines going.  think about the quality of life for the child. Thibk about the horrible complications life support is adding to the mix. Etc. Etc.

t1_duui5ra	0	*	Absolutely nobody credible is saying anything close to that kind of apocalyptic scenario.  We're not going to run out of the ability to have drinking water in cities or food supplied to stores in two decades.  That's absolutely insane.  You could live on the beachfront of California for 50 years and still be perfectly fine by even the more dire predictive models.  You are extreme by all measures, sorry man
t1_dunyx2q	1	*	The article says the only violation of human rights is stricter immigration, which it isnt 
t1_dusl1ml	1	*	No politician would want to explicitly flip on their campaign slogan. They'd try their best to weasle out and backpedal in an indirect manner. The problem Trump has is he named a specific country that is a close ally in a way that attacks them. Weasle words won't cut it here. Real politicians avoid backing themselves into corners this badly. 
t1_dupf4u3	1	*	To be fair, those drugs were going into Russian diplomatic pouches, which means that staff at the Russian embassy were directly involved.  The ambassador blew the whistle on it, but someone else in his organization was guilty.  The article is very very gentle at not actually indicating that one of the 3 Russians who had been discovered must have been a member of embassy staff.

t1_duxvw1h	1	*	The problem isnt that the climate is changing, like you said thats something that just happens. The problem is the RATE of change, the climate is changing incredibly rapidly, far faster than it normally would on its own (without some sort of catastrophic event) and its sudden change thats bad for us.

t1_duv9bax	1	*	Totally agree. I backpacked through SE Asia and began to carry my trash around because I refused to just leave it behind a building or burn it on the streets. I remember seeing Cambodia using giant rubber tubs along the streets to collect trash. But there were so few around they became over filled and the trash overflowed and blew everywhere. There was an attempt but poorly executed. 
t1_duhfxdp	1	*	Well ofcourse the president considers his tweets official statements, he'ld probably consider his farts as well if ever asked. Doesn't mean the rest of the government, the people or foreign nations (should) do the same.  PS: I doubt the official-ness of his tweets are defining on Trump being an international laughing stock. At best it's somewhere close to #173 on a long list of reasons why.
t1_duqxbk5	1	*	He was still working for Trump as of last year.
t1_dum0ls9	1	*	global jihad  https://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/13772662  the goal is to continually attack the west to weaken support for the oil producing gulf states so they can take over and implement an islamic state that rules according to a version of sharia the jihadis consider authentic.  Of course no one in their right mind would want to live in this islamic state because it will be brutal and oppressive, no-one actually wants violent psychopaths, child rapists and mass murderers ruling over them.

t1_durp5lo	1	*	They can't get it period if you've undercut the street dealers and the real shops require ID. I can tell you that at least in WA the selection and prices are insane. It's both better and cheaper in every way than it ever was illegal and less electrical fires from illicit grows. I'd call all of this a major win/win.
t1_duofmt7	1	*	That depends on how bad the economy and social services get, and how bad brexit will be for the common household.
t1_dunew8b	0	*	> The official military response said that he man was shot by the soldiers while charging at them with an iron bar. Military sources said later that shots were fired during the arrest, but **no bullet wounds were found on the body**. Therefore, the growing assessment is that the man died from the beating he sustained from the soldiers.   IDF has changed their story since the video evidence came out. You are repeating something that the IDF themselves have redacted. 
t1_dudge3h	1	*	Obama knew. Hilary already knew. She outright said trump was a Russian puppet during the presidential debate. No one listened.
t1_duen0x6	1	*	Korea will never re-unify.  Rocket Man would destroy the south just like he's destroyed the North.  When South talks about reunification, it's under their flag, not his.

t1_dudni42	1	*	Man if only.. the price toward health care in the GPD has gone up from 18% to 36% since 1960. The issue is that so many more people are becoming unhealthy and prices continue to rise. Supply and demand at its finest.

t1_dut9zqi	1	*	There are some publications you can trust with unnamed sources, and some you shouldnt trust.   If a news organization makes a mistake or publishes something thats wrong and it responds by issuing a correction and/or disciplining staff, its a safe bet that organization actually takes source vetting seriously. WaPo, NYT, CBS, ABC, NBC, and the WSJ all actually punish reporters and journalists who report bullshit. Theyre very careful to not get hit with libel.

t1_dunvw4v	1	*	>I wonder what drove it  American disengagement from enforcing a specific type of world order. China and Russia have never been on-board the Human Rights train. 
t1_dulc8us	1	*	BUNDLE ON DHL!  DHL also delivered a package to me earlier this week by leaving it outside my front door on the fucking street. I only found out they delivered it because I was sitting by my front door at the time waiting for the bell to ring and watched the guy doing the deed.
t1_duh5wyc	1	*	Saudis don't care about the view of the West. Women weren't driving for decades, it's silly to think the mean words from the West have any effect. There is a new leadership, which is more young and thus more willing to take risks. This is why Saudi Arabia is more agressive in its foreign policy and its domestic policy.

t1_dudrxzw	0	*	Because it would be unethical.   They own the patent. If someone invents the cure for some diesease and doesnt want to share it, it's fucking scummy of them but its immoral to attack and steal it from them. It's theirs to do with as they please.

t1_duxucxu	1	*	You really should delete this comment for misinformation. Or atleast edit it, acknowledging that you made a mistake.   The last king was overthrown because he thought nothing of his opposition and was out of tune with reality(regarding his people). This made people religious and loathe him. No relevance to telling what women should do. Infact, his wife was a feminist and he said he found the religious side to be feudal with how they treated women.

t1_dua9lew	1	*	It's also rather clickbaity.  >Assanges thinking appeared to be rooted not in ideological agreement with the right wing in the U.S., but in the tactical idea that a Republican president would face more resistance to an aggressive military posture than an interventionist President Hillary Clinton would.  https://theintercept.com/2018/02/14/julian-assange-wikileaks-election-clinton-trump/
t1_duwjp91	1	*	Yeah, it's a very prevalent way of thinking in Chinese culture. Minimize risks, don't make waves, trust few, take care of your own.  There's a risk/quant joke in there somewhere.
t1_duiink2	1	*	Meldonium is a supplement and was even widely available on ebay until 2014.

t1_duoqx6z	0	*	And yet it's the right with an actual body count. Funny how that works.
t1_dunomaz	0	*	I'm pretty sure they wouldn't let them get that far.  They'll probably be thrown out of the plane on the way back.  
t1_duxty8b	0	*	Except he didn't attack the South.  
t1_dunx08u	0	*	Moral Relativism is stupid.  You hold to your own principles whatever they are, so at some level, you think they're superior.  If you didn't, you wouldn't hold to them.    Refusing to condemn behavior you find shitty is just moral cowardice.  You consider it wrong because you don't do it, and yet you'll sit on the sidelines and hmm and haw about respecting traditions.  No, some traditions suck.

t1_dun8i5b	0	*	This isn't even one of the terrible parts of Islam.  Like, Iran has lots of sexist laws (not to mention serious human rights abuses) and these people get offended over minor cultural custom (not touching the opposite gender unless they're family) that doesn't actually hurt anyone?  I mean come on.
t1_duki3b1	1	*	Will be the last people Im sure, and hope, so the rest dont flee. Might as well get the dirt on mid level guys to have enough intel to bang them all at once.
t1_dumpt2n	1	*	Honestly I feel like a lot of the most expensive things aren't even that appealing. Like what would you even do with a yacht?  Like, a big house to store all your shit of course. Bill Gates has that.  And then I think it would just be excessive consumption of regular stuff. Eating well. Owning every movie you could ever want. Keeping your own personal library with all the cool books. That sort of stuff.
t1_dud3p92	1	*	To be clear, Rosenstein purposefully intended to convey that these allegations are not meant to inform anyone as to whether Trump or his people are implicated or not. If they are, that would be a separate set of indictments at a later stage. If they are not, we'll find out when they formally announce an end to their investigation.

t1_dun1sd2	1	*	unless your ideas are very solidly formed (ie attacked from 2 or 3 different intelligent angles, and intelligently defended), you're naive to think that you're not vulnerable to this exact same thing.   the era of shallow information astroturfing has made it very easy to misinform the reddit types, who often just read the headline, not even the source article, let alone the references with critical thought.

t1_duelgs4	1	*	The buildings were obviously much smaller, right? No skyscrapers in Precolumbian America. The allusion to Manhattan is an audience puller, but not very good at drawing a realistic idea of the city. 
t1_duvwvo8	1	*	No, you are conflating selective propagation/selective breeding with genetic modification. They are related, but different.  By your logic every human is genetically modified, since we are all the product of people actively choosing who to breed and not breed with..
t1_dud8ulc	1	*	As an American, I agree with you. Fuck these sore ass nationalists down voting you.
t1_duwofn9	1	*	What a weird opinion for someone I saw selling drugs yesterday evening.

t1_dup6o3f	1	*	They aren't changing her race. They can't do that even if they wanted. It's a city festival. They chose a girl who can mount a horse and is learning fencing. It makes her a pretty legit Joan IMO...

t1_dup3buv	0	*	To his credit, it's clear Putin is covering this up to avoid pressure from Russians to retaliate for their 100 dead young men.  There's a lot of wisdom in that cowardice.
t1_dus1n4n	1	*	Or maybe the situation there is actually changing. Maybe significant (reportable) events precede military campaigns. Maybe there is no conspiracy.

t1_dubpnmn	0	*	Babies heads get misshapen during unassisted vaginal birth. The heads are meant to squish. Are you sure those helmets aren't for mishappen heads from laying on one spot too long? The weight of a babies head will make it flat, if, say it spends a lot of time in the car seat.

t1_duzbec6	0	*	You should move to the moon. 
t1_dur1s7e	1	*	Manafort is playing for a pardon. It's his only move left. He's trying to do a mini-Trump thing by loudly continually repeating an obvious lie (his innocence) in the hopes the base will eat it up and come to his defense. It hasn't worked though.
t1_duclols	1	*	I'm almost afraid to comment in this thread because there's some serious bent going on in the comments. Plus a lot of misinformation. I agree that sometimes they are necessary and even warranted even if it's maternal request. Sometimes people have sexual trauma or medical reasons that don't quite fit into medically necessary too. I think the who is just suggesting that people opt into c sections for no reason but convenience should definitely rethink that.

t1_dul62mz	1	*	Even farting is good for Bitcoin.
t1_duylxx6	1	*	Neither. The claim is that Trump had the prostitutes pee on the bed. There's no indication he participated in any way other than watching. He wasn't on the bed and doesn't seem to have ever been on the bed. Unfortunately the narrative around this particular story has changed to be as salacious as possible, making it easier for folks on the right to decry it as fake news.

t1_dukk7a1	1	*	We'll take irony over a wrecked climate.
t1_duof5a6	1	*	Russia and China have long histories of authoritarianism, so it's not any particular winds of change there. In Europe and America the clear culprits are the financial crisis and subsequent scapegoating of minorities by right wing politicians in those countries at the exact time those countries are undergoing demographic change in terms of age and ethnic makeup.
t1_duj6xit	0	*	Dunno why you are 7th...  Also this video is ridiculous.  Its actually so ridiculous I have a hard time believing it was meant to influence voters through fear.  Seams more like a ha ha I'm funny vote for me video.

t1_duru2ey	1	*	Well if corporations are allowed to spend unlimited money on influencing elections and politicians, boycotting them is the only way for real people to have their voices heard. If you disagree with this method maybe citizens united should be overturned.

t1_dubo326	1	*	The Russians don't want us to have a controlled society. Just the opposite in fact. The Russians want us divided and squabbling amongst ourselves so that we are weak. That way when Russia wants to fuck with the rest of the world, we'll be too busy bitching at each other to notice and/or care. The gun control debate is a frigging gold mine of divisiveness. Along with Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, etc etc.
t1_dun7l52	1	*	Speak for yourself, my parents are wonderful and smart people. 
t1_duarb54	1	*	I don't think it's like that, I think more because Israel/US sit on the most lucrative parts of oil fields. Thus, with Russia taking over, Israel/US/(possibly kurds) is now sitting on their oil fields yo.

t1_dur3w51	1	*	Even corrupt ran country should not be starving like this. Manduro gotta go bye bye and next leader sell off state owned assets regrading food production and consumer goods.  Need market system for food and consumer goods Venezuela does not have this like Columbia or Peru.   
t1_dubncum	1	*	why are most of your posts about russia hysteria?  
t1_dui7fin	1	*	Gates is also very technocratic, he's not even saying this from a moral standpoint. He's saying it from a sustainable standpoint, which gives his statement even more weight than it already does.

t1_duovi3x	0	*	When you injure people for your cause you end up injuring your cause.
t1_dujvbdt	1	*	at this point it would only be a news worthy story if Donald Trump told the truth about something.
t1_durcvgn	1	*	They surrounded themselves with civilians to protect military infrastructure. The top brass of their military didn't want to quit. I'm more then likely guessing they wanted a invasion from the USA to cause as much damage as possible before any surrender for better surrendering conditions on their terms. They just didn't expect the nukes
t1_dua7ojc	1	*	Like a Tibetan fighting monk robot
t1_dugqmsi	1	*	TAKE THEM TO THE FIREPLACE!
t1_duebm2p	1	*	This cocaine isn't going to distribute itself...
t1_duwilhx	0	*	I'm not sure what you're trying to say here though?   Are you implying because we know predicted the current situation that they're unrelated to man mate climate change and its effect on the global climate? Wouldn't you then say that man made climate change means weather patterns become impossible to predict?    
t1_duaovhk	1	*	China does a pretty good job at making U.S companies bend the knee to enter their market.  The citizens can still use VPN's though. 
t1_dueimn9	1	*	> 7.500 to 10.000  Holy crap what does it take to be well-paid if that is still little money according to you? The minimum wage here is 1500.-

t1_dudcwft	1	*	The aftershocks were closer to the surface, the first being a depth 24.6 km and the afterhsocks were a depth of 8.9 km, I assume that is why you felt them as more intense than the 7.2 one.

t1_dunhovh	0	*	I feel that would be valid criticism if the reason to burn the nappies was the cat's eye color.    Also, who doesn't laugh at christians in general when some get in a hissy fit because some emo singer, or piece of art, is satanic? Because most people I know certainly do.

t1_duwmpzd	0	*	Maybe the author wanted to be clever because while outdated in British English, the word Furore is a completely normal word here in Germany and describes the outrage on all sides pretty well. 
t1_duu0fjf	1	*	Some of them are rational at the cost of also being evil shitbags. Others are a combination of the two. 
t1_dur953p	1	*	Lol liberals are the ones wanting to invade and intervene in democratic elections there. Grow up liberal
t1_duz8qll	1	*	Yep, which is why it's hilarious to watch the world's top economy continuously shoot itself in the foot haha.

t1_duapcyp	1	*	Reddit will up-vote anything anti-Putin or *RUSSIAN COLLUSION*.
t1_dujrcrw	1	*	Someone should start a subreddit to keep track of all those times; we could call it /r/DTF
t1_ducj9ih	1	*	Oxytocin actually strengthens the pain and quickens the labor, and then epidural takes away pain and slows it down, so it's a cycle that ends in C section because the constant shift stresses the baby.
t1_duyebh0	0	*	That would be pointless. We'd just have to do a new reset every few years as a new group of ignorant people come to realize the impact of social media. We either need a mechanism to fix things afterwards or leave it all alone and just accept that it's ok to do stupid things online and not hold it against people for eternity.

t1_duz7lqw	0	*	Not Netflix ... Comedy Central is gonna score the bid for the rights to all this crap.  This is golden material.  No comedy writers would try to make up stuff like this because it seems too outrageous.  This is golden.
t1_duplko9	0	*	The problem isn't a funding issue. The myth that we don't have proper healthcare and free education because we invest in our military is completely bogus. We spend more per person on healthcare and education than any other country. The problem is bought-and-paid-for politicians and rules that allow a lobbying system to co-opt one or more branches of our government.
t1_dupo6vu	1	*	They sure have more of that relatively undervalued Euro!
t1_dupkivu	1	*	Well at least they've something in common with the USA then.

t1_duw3qar	0	*	Lol so is having common sense political now?  Nice name btw ;)
t1_dubnbgv	1	*	Reddit should add badges to user names in comments,  or use different colors than only blue for users...etc.  None bot certified accounts... I mean, amanofthenorth, for example, deserves a little more love and hearing, than my 1,000 other A I generated accounts.  
t1_dujy3q0	0	*	Im fairly certain at this point Mueller has pretty much everything he needs and is 10 steps ahead of everyone. Its beautiful.
t1_duxpyel	1	*	Seems like a reasonable solution would be to allow the raises and then set up another x year plan that has reduced / no raises until the pay is correct.  At the same time use the fact that you are declining raises for x years to negotiate higher wages for nurses / support staff.
t1_duzhbw8	1	*	At my local grocery store there's 4-5 options for regular spaghetti, the only product difference is the brand. In the bulk section there is one option for spaghetti. So it makes sense that there would be less items because you don't need to stock all of the identical products with slightly different packaging if there is no packaging. 
t1_duby9m2	0	*	Because few governments have economic policies that regulate the externalities of treating your housing market as just another asset market.
t1_dul41k6	1	*	Because russians love putin. Only western propaganda makes him look bad. Because after all he defends the interests pf his nation regardless of what you all think.  He is a leader that puts his prople in first place
t1_duc1tr4	1	*	Better than oil rigs I guess.   It could also help new reefs.
t1_dusnzba	1	*	Maybe go around /r/SyrianCivilWar and talk to some. Get to know them.
t1_dudde3h	1	*	unsolicited advice, but have you been tested for ADHD? before I was got my diagnosis/medication I would always try to self-medicate with coffee and energy drinks, thinking I was just addicted to caffeine
t1_dudde3d	1	*	Took two years after Watergate before Nixon left office. Justice moves slowly.
t1_duc5mz9	1	*	You seem like a knowledgeable person. Can you clarify a question for me?    With regards to planting trees to reduce CO2 levels, is that not just a temporary measure? Once a tree dies and decays it releases that CO2 back into the atmosphere, no?  If I'm thinking about thjs right,  the only way planting trees helps permanently  cut atmospheric CO2  is if the number of trees on earth increases permanently. Otherwise the trees are just temporarily storing it? 
t1_dup5ww9	0	*	Well, it works in Canada and Australia. The populations are widely distributed and fairly non-homogeneous in both those countries too, with a similar culture to the U.S.

t1_duwu64v	1	*	Yeah this is a totally worthless story
t1_dusp50a	1	*	Look, if Trump doesn't keep lying about building that wall pretty soon people will begin to think he lied about building that wall.   
t1_duuelve	1	*	unfortunately a lot of innocent get caught in the net (e.g. people from less populated areas or people from places with less doctors, or even non-EU citizens who did not have access to vaccination).  
t1_dujiwt6	1	*	It was 50/50. My money was on blaming Hillary.
t1_duwgeqk	1	*	>What would you do in -25C?  Curse the French for making a car that is an coin flip if the engine will start this morning. Hopefully my battery holds firm.  >freeze in -5C  Don't really like that either tbh. Everything is slippery as shit and driving gets far more dangerous. Worst possible outcome if that -5 turns into +5 for a single day...Shit gets truly crazy. Earth turns into slippery ice.   
t1_duy31q1	1	*	Reparations and redistribution is what Black Lives Matter has argued for...  Remember this? https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/02/us/politics/black-lives-matter-campaign.html
t1_dui16q6	0	*	Move closer to work then (no need for a car) or look at bigger career changes. A 30% increase is nothing to shout home about even if you get it. 30% net increase maybe
t1_dujla0p	1	*	Yes please. 
t1_dui90ye	0	*	We are glad too! 
t1_duixxq2	1	*	In many ways this was all predicted through simple demographics.  The baby boom (ie baby boomers, ww2-boom) had a resounding affect.   I'd like to hope that prices for homes will fall after baby boomers mostly punch out, but the developing world birth rates more than makes up for this. 
t1_dujcsog	1	*	>Glad to see the fine based on his income  He should have made himself a corporation.

t1_duulsg7	0	*	I've never read the books, but I saw a documentary saying that Disney's version of Poppins is waaaay softer than the book's. So maybe she was harsh?
t1_dur8t2f	1	*	Strangely enough, items sent via mail door to door do tend to arrive. You just have to know an address. But freight? Nahh According to what a Venezuelan told me  Any items determined to be humanitarian aid are confiscated by the government  then went on to add  Or stolen along the way under pretense of inspections

t1_duhhzyj	0	*	We can use proxies such as tree rings, permafrost cores and climate models to estimate ice extent in the past. Obviously it isn't exact but it gives us a good idea. 
t1_dubwp09	0	*	Well, except they signed the refugee convention. I don't know that it's imperious and arrogant to say a country should do what it agreed to. Especially when it's in the form of lukewarm criticism. No one's threatening sanctions or anything. 
t1_dus0ul5	1	*	MSU? That flooding was FUCKED hahaha 
t1_duj44t7	1	*	You say that, but the GOP used it as a wedge issue in 2004, a lot of talk about an anti gay marriage constitutional amendment.

t1_dufr1l2	0	*	Airplanes don't kill people. Gravity kills people.

t1_dug90iv	0	*	Why is it assumed we all have children and have to take time off? Or are women not allowed time off like men are?  
t1_dup1dgm	1	*	So you are saying it was not state sponsored drug trafficking. Just one of the high ranking Russian embassy officials was using his diplomatic immunity to smuggle drugs. Good job Russia! 
t1_duxp8jb	1	*	they can just come to america. where they can refuse to marry anyone outside of their religion, forbid anyone other than straight muslim men from entering their mosques and call anyone who looks at them sideways a bigot
t1_dubff28	1	*	Read the history of the Fanta brand.
t1_dume52g	1	*	Spanish have that old money.
t1_duucewb	1	*	As a European who has spent significant time in the US I can also add that the vaccine/ autism myth isnt as popular or wide spread in Europe. Not to say it doesnt exist but it is certainly less frequently believed plus (at least in my area) the religious aspect is nearly non-existing. 
t1_duli5iq	0	*	So...like Instagram?
t1_dusldaj	1	*	and one less wall to pay, seems like a Grand success indeed. :) 
t1_ducwg13	1	*	Its especially bad in London because the UK government turns a blind eye to money laundering, especially from Russia. At least Canada is taking action against foreign purchases for real estate speculation. 
t1_duk5w5b	0	*	If its stupid but it works, it isnt stupid.
t1_dulra15	1	*	To be fair, only around 200 people protested, which would equate to around 0.01% of Munichs population. It would be like having 10000 people in a room and only one person in the room disagrees. 
t1_duwlvsy	0	*	It certainly doesnt seem to be politicians and government employees perpetrating acts causing government, law, constitution, sovereign to be held in hatred and contempt.

t1_dur0ggt	1	*	Ah yes, the good old reverse Nigerian scam where you give 76 millions instead of receiving it.
t1_duqzn5v	1	*	They were told that the American military is weak and underfunded and they believed it. I mean, why not? It was the president of the United States of America who said it, and he is best friends with their president.

t1_duye5q9	1	*	A benevolent dictator (or ruling party) could be the best mode for political stability and progress.   But power corrupts. The more power the more it corrupts ~ hence while I think gridlocked partisan democracy is preferable. 
t1_dusllr4	1	*	>my president  My president ftfy
t1_dutfuq8	1	*	You know, we actually have something called nuance and discretion, which allows us to support this one specific thing that he is saying, while also disagreeing with other things he says and does. We understand that the world isn't black and white, unlike most die hard Trump supporters who have the 100% with him or 100% against him mentality.

t1_dur8nr3	0	*	Ones a long time ally and the others been our political rival for 80 years. Makes sense to me.
t1_dum4dij	1	*	Well, it's strange because Pentagon publish some shit that Russia can invade Baltic and fuck up whole Europe so Europe should build more NATO bases and US troops should be presented there.

t1_duu1846	1	*	I don't think many people would be pleased with the policy on marriage, especially douche bags like Pruitt.
t1_duofoya	1	*	Well there was a federal assault weapon ban for years that expired. Maybe we can try something with mental health or keeping names/faces off the front page. Not that Republicans are supporting that either, which is pretty hypocritical in my opinion.
t1_ducmhdm	0	*	Which is ironic considering Poland only seems to do well economically when it has a sizeable Jewish population. 
t1_ducegbs	1	*	US first destroyed the whole Iraqi Army, punished all officers and left the worst Army in the world. Maybe look into roots of problem, not what you want to see. 
t1_dup1r9x	1	*	If you have a bridge on top of the other, does that count as one bridge or two bridge? Also what's the minimal requirement for something to be considered a bridge?

t1_dubqp5q	1	*	It's pretty clear that they are trying to divide us. I have gotten to the point of triple checking every political fact I see. I have seen Republicans upset about clearly fake things from the Democrats, and Democrats upset about clearly fake things from the Republicans. Russia knows that if they post fake, but believable things, most people will take it at first read, and it will tear us apart.

t1_dui6cme	1	*	They've been saying we'd lose Florida for 50 years now.  This is just the latest scare tactic.  They've used acid rain, holes in the ozone layer, and super hurricanes.  Some how some way Florida is still here.
t1_duqwddk	1	*	The 2001 AUMF was directed towards agencies involved in the attack.  So stretch to include Iraq and ISIS and even Libya as a harboring country.  Syria is now to block Iran  and Russia.  Legally this has serious issues, but IRL the US can do anything it damn chooses to do.

t1_dut59av	1	*	Only problem is the USA's media is used as a weapon in politics, just like China. We're in very scary times. The media will keep telling you the Russians goal was to get Trump elected, it wasn't, it was to divide our country (and they have) by making some people believe our election was fraudulent/our President is incapable or Hitler etc. Russia knows democracy only crumbles from within and the dumbass Democrats and Media have been duped

t1_duyhbka	1	*	The grass isn't always greener on the other side.
t1_dug67na	1	*	My boyfriends roommates are atheists so it is not only a religious American thing. They say that it looks better and that's why they believe in circumcision. Absolutely disgusting. 
t1_dubu6h4	1	*	Actually prolonged labour can cause problems like fetal distress (babys heart rate dips), or uterine infection (the longer its been since the mothers water broke, the more likely she is to get an infection  these can lead to sepsis). Also, the risk of stillbirth goes up significantly after 41weeks + 3 days gestation.

t1_duwnu8l	1	*	So glad you are safe. I can imagine it was terrifying, that amount of shaking for so long and then all the aftershocks too? Scary. An event of this size could have done much worse if it were nearer to population centers. I've heard that [the count was 14 deaths](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/02/27/589068462/at-least-14-dead-in-papua-new-guinea-after-strong-quake-sets-off-mudslides) from landslides. Very unfortunate and I hope no other fatalities are reported.

t1_dunaguq	0	*	Well for example take a short trip to Romania and drive around for a bit and you may have the police stop you for a speeding fine or similar which you pay on the spot to him in cash.   Corrupt countries are when doing even simple stuff like seeing a Dr requires you to pay a bribe.

t1_duwgxiq	1	*	I'm with you they sold you a car and what comes with it if your not able to drive that car because of a problem that they are responsible for they should fix it. If all the brakes in diesel cars stopped working and no one with a diesel car was able to drive they would take some sort of action .I hope they are acknowledging this,and above all I hope they don't benefit or try to benefit from this .

PS: Im dutch was in newspaper.

t1_duxyue4	0	*	American intervention is one of the big problems that started it, doubt anything else will be done.
t1_duhgk7t	1	*	Makes me wonder a) if we shouldn't be medicating more depressed people, and b) what their rates of illegal drug use are like. I'd bet they're not in an opioid crisis, and (assuming this is prescription statistic) I assume many Danes with mental health issues actually feel able to seek treatment.

t1_dup9pqm	1	*	Like an Anti-Michael Jackson.
t1_dun8uoh	0	*	It makes the current politicians look environmental conscious while not affecting people while theyre in power. Also gives the next government a chance to repeal, as is normally the case in bipartisan flip flop countries. Change nothing but have the feeling of change. 
t1_duynj9i	1	*	Salting the earth would be wrong, and unnecessary. Its not like these confiscated farms have ever actually been successful, they just strip the houses and barns of anything of value and sell the land. 
t1_durly75	0	*	> After 5 years, not even conservatives in this state would think of repealing it.  I think part of the reason we have conservatives rejecting change is because they don't want to admit they were fucking wrong.  The way MJ legislation snuck in slowly, over 10-15 years might be a good model for the future.  
t1_duj21st	1	*	Lol, now that is a really hilarious video!
t1_duukui7	0	*	The Chinese government systematically protects these illegal fishing vessels and does not do anything to stop it because it is such an economic driver and all they care about is economic growth.  They are a totalitarian government, the second they decide to crack down on illegal fishing it stops (and heads would roll).
t1_dui0q40	1	*	> top income earners already pay most of the taxes  No shit sherlock, you just figure that out?  You state this as if it should have some barring on the % amount they pay in taxes. Thats your opinion, you'll find many who disagree.

t1_due3v9a	1	*	There is a difference between not supporting the US prison system and just allowing people in, though. Countries like Ireland can bar Russians from entering without also extraditing them to the US.

t1_dueylus	0	*	I dont like male circumcision but equating it to female circumcision is disingenuous as fuck.  
t1_duohvkl	1	*	A quick trip into /r/News will confirm how this goes. You will get down voted badly for even suggesting that guns are part of the problem as they praise the head of the nra and the president whove blamed everyone from the police to video games. Lots of blame to go around. None to guns.
t1_duthqxf	1	*	I spoke to a bloke down the pub who thinks salami is a vegetable. So what?
t1_duxpth8	1	*	If my uncle read the words Iran use to be pretty liberal and progressive he would assume that meant they use to be like ISIS. 
t1_duzgqx6	0	*	Shes not asking for asylum from an embassy. Shes asking journalists or intel agencies to help. And for everyone asking why shes focus on America, she said shed give the information to anyone or any country that helped her. 
t1_duli4os	0	*	He wrote Nixon a letter calling for the slaughter of one million Vietnamese.  He denied saying antisemitic things (Jews have a stranglehold on the media and synagogue of Satan among other things), until his tapes with Nixon were released, and then he changed his stance to not recalling saying those things.  He didnt want women to work.  That weird thing where Mike Pence doesnt trust himself to be alone with women? Thats called the Billy Graham Rule.
t1_dut7i4i	1	*	I see you're doing the usual damage control for the ccp in here
t1_duttgu8	1	*	Or put them in mandatory training as exorcists. A nice little romp with a demon or two might help them control their urges to romp with children...

t1_dun8o6y	1	*	How do we know this article isn't a troll set up to frame a bunch of fall guys
t1_dutuo88	1	*	But it also might have been true when that high school book was published.  The ocean being a bottomless pit of food was based on the fact that fish could reproduce at a faster rate than we could ever eat them.  Which was true.  But in the last 40 years our population has doubled and the last 100 years it has increased by 8x.  We have been pushing the carrying capacity of the planet to the max.
t1_dul9hdg	1	*	Germany supported Hitler too. Just because the Philippines apparently is a brainwashed shithole doesn't mean going out murdering drug users and sellers and making dumb comments like this is any less stupid.
t1_dufuyhu	1	*	I was surprised by this as well. The fact that it is a Russian really doesn't help their situation. 
t1_dul445g	1	*	I enjoyed my world religion class. It was essentially a material history-based beginners' philosophy and cultural anthropology class for many liberal arts-oriented students like me.
t1_dusiibk	1	*	U0001f525
t1_dupvqd3	0	*	No entirely debt free. If you receive Bafxf6G, a form of student's loan, you need to pay it back. - Without interest and only to a maximum of 10k, but still its (technically) debt.  Also this is not to cover the costs for university (roughly 300 per semester) but your living expenses. So they do actually pay you to study for about 4 years (depending on what you study) and you don't even have to pay it all back :D
t1_duu8lnj	1	*	A fair number of his supporters, at their core, absolutely hate America and want to tear it down.  Trump is doing a good job for those people.
t1_dumt5bo	1	*	You don't have to read the article to know when Redditors didnt read past the headline before commenting.  - some Redditor   I agree with the general idea of what you're getting at, but a combat veteran discussing a combat situation in response to a lawmaker suggesting teachers become proficient in firearm combat is actually relevant.  It's not like this is a combat veteran discussing the merits of bake sales for fundraising in public schools.
t1_dutk6yn	1	*	Even if Trump is the best president ever, I wouldn't want him to be in power indefinitely.
t1_duxk25x	1	*	Yea right, if Trump could outlaw clothes he would. Easier to oogle.
t1_duhu3us	1	*	I believe essentially because its sustainable and green.  It seems like an incredible idea and it seems quite a few years off so hopefully itll be a lot cheaper than that reported price.  The wooden structure is also supposed to be as safe or safer than steel in a fire with a few wooden skyscrapers springing up around the world and apartments planned in London.
t1_dum881s	1	*	Some weird twisted and bastardized form of Zoroastrianism. 
t1_duwenso	1	*	Just like the USA PATRIOT Act is rarely used for actual terrorism.

t1_duz3vcq	1	*	In what countries isn't feminism needed according to you?
t1_duiyekn	1	*	Median monthly household income is S$9023. This means 50% of Singaporean households earns at least this amount.  Median per household member income is S$2699. Note this includes non-working members like young children and retirees.   Assuming average of $150 payout. It is like a 5.5% bonus or less for 50% of Singaporeans. Not a lot in my opinion. 
t1_duukbzb	1	*	Le Phat Beats Generation By Dre.
t1_dueoi66	1	*	I remember when Americans did not defend attacks by Russia on its institutions. Oddly enough, it was Republicans who were the staunchest defenders against such attacks.
t1_dunr55n	1	*	the fact that meetings are taking place, which haven't before (IIRC) is a step, its progress, but more does need to be done. 
t1_duqftsz	0	*	Right because most political machines like the NRA turn down money because they have plenty, thank you very much.

t1_duuq7x3	0	*	One of those documentaries about k2 that was on Netflix a couple years ago was amazing. These guys were climbing it without an supplemental oxygen at all. 
t1_duj7ftk	1	*	Actually, that could happen. If you look through Craigslist for a roommate, you may not deny him based on sexuality. Further, if he does not make it known (which, why would he?) You may, by your own setting of precedence of heterosexual exploits within your bedroom, have to tolerate homosexual exploits proceeding within his.  Your scenario is completely plausible within the United States, which is good, and I support. But to act like it's not a possibility just isn't earnest.
t1_duvqbu1	1	*	Yes, they have a huge drug problem. Duterte has arguably made it alot worse because he's killed about 20,000 people with no trials, not all of whom were even involved in the drug trade.

t1_dujwjtr	1	*	In theory: There is more than enough, the Senate would need to bring charges.  In reality: The Republican party needs to lose their control over the government in the next election because they are refusing to impeach their own.

t1_duq7n3l	1	*	An FBI investigation is not propaganda.

t1_duzjjta	1	*	This article takes place in the Atlantic off the coast of Georgia, USA. No Japanese or actual hunting involved. They are dying off due to warming waters, lack of food, and the reproducing females being very outnumbered by males. Its super sad actually that it has everything to do with human influence on the ecosystem and not hunting.

t1_duffnf3	1	*	Source?  Russia could easily funnel money through other third parties to support its interests.  The KGB as an institution is famous for these kinds of tactics.
t1_duz0eib	1	*	He's not the sole prosecutor. He's got something like 16 extremely experienced prosecutors working under him working on the details. Killing Mueller off will do little to hinder the investigation, while drawing even more massive attention to it.

t1_dunv44f	1	*	What's it like being a trump supporter, when he's been the worst president in history?
t1_dutp24q	1	*	You can get a little sick after, because the vaccines job is to stimulate an immune response (which causes some of the symptoms you get while sick).  But after this, youre probably immune to those strains of flu, and at the least will have a much easier time of it if you get the flu.  Couple days of mild cough is worth it if you or someone around you might die of flu if they get it.
t1_dupfok1	1	*	Simply outlawing offshore banking schemes would guarantee a surplus for America. Gee, I wonder why nobody in America is talking about that? 
t1_duxxs7k	1	*	They mass produce nerve gas, it's not the hardest thing to do if you can build factories.   NK is a joke at advanced technologies, but nerve agents are 50's technology. 
t1_dui4ww0	1	*	Not until actual Millennials start voting, let alone for the best representation, likely liberal, and even themselves start being in office nothing will remotely enact change. A UK homeowner, middle class, boomer is not going to understand the horrible inflation and influx of problems a millennial will face now or going forth. I could go on...
t1_dui1ce0	1	*	US salaries are still much higher than the EU ones. Insurance costs though kill it for the lower earners.
t1_dukbpf4	1	*	One of the most famous groves in Redwood National Park is named after a timber baron.  His wife donated the land posthumously and insisted on the name...so now the rangers get to explain what a dick he was.  *All the time.*
t1_duk16yq	0	*	He's basically Columbo.
t1_dufvg3u	1	*	> Let me explain why his statement is bad - some Polish people murdered Jews during and after the holocaust and helped the Nazis out of their own free will, and nobody held a gun against their heads and forced them to do that.  Hiding jews in occupied Poland was punishable by death. So yes  Germans in fact hold that gun to Polish heads.
t1_duyi8sg	0	*	Sure, Jan.
t1_duxgx26	1	*	Not to mention the fact that you can't trust Chinese scientists to not fuge the numbers to get the outcomes they want. I'm not saying that the west doesn't do it but Chinese are almost infamous about that kind of stuff.

t1_dudwzk0	1	*	> That you did not know you stole from [Keyser Soze] is the only reason you are still alive.
t1_dum19rf	0	*	Lots of investors banking on finding a way to properly monetize the thing. It is pretty big.
t1_duiji8g	1	*	Not just an explanation. Knowledge is power. Once you know what you're dealing with, you can learn to manage it, play to your strengths, know your limitations etc.
t1_duzaoju	1	*	Pointed because if Trump's not careful he'll get crucified.
t1_duj7cy3	0	*	Exactly. I get everyone wants to be optimistic and hope that for whatever reason, working with the North will be successful this time, but it most likely won't. Expect them to take what ever we give them, and funnel it to there program. All they need it this point, assuming they have miniturization, is to create a good reentry vehicle.
t1_duigt8r	1	*	Greece is fucked. Population too stupid and lazy. 
t1_duev9h7	1	*	I agree. However, the animals still have the ability and right to fight back, and it should be a risk you take in account whenever you hunt.
t1_dutkdcr	1	*	To be clear, there was never a democracy to begin with.
t1_duqpmes	1	*	Should point out, that this has NOTHING to do with anything related to the election.
t1_dutie7t	1	*	I bet they'd argue that it would decrease coz of all dead kids probably having autism would have have died as well
t1_dua3wta	1	*	it doesn't look so strange to me
t1_dulpdmg	0	*	Extremists aren't known for being clever people.
t1_dui9jfy	1	*	Cries in Brexit
t1_duyq4ew	1	*	It's not like these politicians will eat dirt like rest of population once famine will kick in. That's typical populist move of someone advocating for 'social justice':  >We must ensure that we restore the dignity of our people without compensating the criminals who stole our land
t1_dust85w	1	*	This happened in Germany during the summer, bodies liquefied and the parked trailer was found by smell and blood leaking out of it. It wasn't pretty.
t1_duhwd5h	1	*	Apparently some people have received a sarcasm vaccine.
t1_due8top	1	*	They'll 'deactivate' the data. 
t1_duzjdwv	1	*	Thing is countries don't go oh your really violent here have your own little province or state so you don't fuck with the rest of us for other religions. Islam is stupid,violent, and needs to calm down or fuck off but it wont be addressed till there is major crisis.
t1_dupg3ka	0	*	> It's just a broken metric that economists use to justify giving more money to the banks, so that those same economists can get a cushy job once they get through the revolving door of government.  Economists regularly recommend targeting investments that result in larger GDP growth, like transit infrastructure spending (which results in a 1 to 3 times return on investment in the first year, and 3 to 7 times return within 3 years of opening).
t1_durto20	1	*	Ahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha. You people are degenerates. You would let murderers get away with their crimes because theyre Nazis. Nazi apologists please go into the ocean, thanks. 
t1_duyezo1	1	*	it should be.   *guy kills 69 people*  Norway:  Here's a PlayStation 3 and three cells to yourself.  Everyone else, give up your weapons. 
t1_dupq63e	1	*	DAAAVHIIDDD. WHY DID I JUST SEND MY MOTHER TO ATLANTUHHHH?!
t1_duv9x49	0	*	You're poorly informed if you think Australians are causing the problem. The locals have next to no education on the environment, or plastics. Source: lived in Bali.
t1_duhpk79	1	*	You could just test after finals too and save money
t1_dugq57m	1	*	It's like Nixon never left us.
t1_dutkwrh	1	*	Hahaha!!! Indeed
t1_dudncl1	1	*	Because God forbid someone different gets it any better than them.  
t1_dung698	1	*	It baffles me to see people vote Tories or any other conservative neo-libral party in any other country ... they never serve people and are quite open about their opposition to any sort of social support for general population. Privatise everything, fuck the poor, middle class will carry us through this, maximize corporate profits.  And people cheer that. Trickled down idiocy.
t1_duya4am	1	*	This is your first race war Huh?  - Morty
t1_dunlyn7	0	*	Not only *do* people care, there is also the fact that there are many, many museums and memorials documenting and commemorating exactly this.   This entire thing is just another straw puppet of the populist Polish government. 
t1_duc0dmk	1	*	Took me less than a second to work that out, also right click, copy image works too

t1_dugisv7	0	*	Hi. Conservative here: Let's have fucking justice. Let's impeach, and then convict Donald Trump of any and all crimes he may be guilty of -- and take down Pence too, while you're at it.  But remember, the sword of Justice must cut both ways. So if we're to have justice, we also need to know what the Democrats knew, and when.  Let's get ALL of the corruption. Not just red corruption, or blue corruption. Get it ALL.  Are you and yours really ready for that? Because I see no evidence that you are. 
t1_duhfy93	1	*	You would think someone would read the article before making a pointless comment like yours, but that's the kind of world we live in
t1_dupc70y	0	*	I mean, I know DeVos has basically no understanding of how the US education system works, but is she actually that close to Blackwater? Not sure if serious.
t1_dukec41	1	*	As an American, I am totally unsurprised that they are having trouble negotiating a divorce.   I'm sure India, Pakistan, Kenya, Ireland, and many others are not surprised either.

t1_dufsvee	1	*	The ATR is a very reliable piece of engineering that is flown all around the world. It is not a relic.
t1_ducru7m	0	*	Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein:  There is no allegation in this indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity. There is no allegation that the charge conduct altered the outcome of the election.  I read that as no collusion with this. no??  Russia meddled in the election, we already knew this???
t1_dul0yd2	1	*	Yes I agree that the transparency of how this news article was extremely spoon-fed, is quiye obvious. Clearly, seeking your exact reaction. Propaganda at its finest everyone!
t1_dud5fpf	1	*	They are yes. But hopefully with Uzbekistan not being such a paranoid bully to me its neighbors like it was from independence until 2016, trade connections will flourish between the five stans. Lots of wasted economic potential and energy market disfunction.
t1_dunwfwl	0	*	Just like the Patriot Act, react first, think later. Let your trustworthy self-serving politicians do the thinking for you. When has that ever failed us? 
t1_dunrpcu	1	*	Why? If he had the power that they did, he'd be doing the same thing.
t1_duhixbw	1	*	Oh, go eat a brick.

t1_dubxoce	1	*	Palm oil is in SO MANY products. It's hard to avoid.
t1_dulom7i	1	*	When has humanity ever come upon a new technology and done it correctly? Never.   We invented axes hundreds of thousands of years ago and we're still not done killing each other with them.
t1_dugad64	0	*	You know what would really help? Instead of risking their lives to become leeches and statistically become a point of violence, maybe, and just maybe, they should fight for their country so they can guarantee safety for their children 
t1_dup2ier	0	*	An authoritarian will always find a pretense for his authoritarianism.

t1_duw8pd5	1	*	There has to be a limit to your ignorance. 
t1_duldc6g	1	*	The story gets so few upvotes because, at this time, people are getting fed up with all the delusional crying babies americans are.
t1_duc8f12	1	*	Look, why point fingers. Let's just all take the blame, shut up, and move on. - pretty much what you said.
t1_dup0p77	0	*	People in the Middle East were not look brown before Arabians invaded in the 7th century. Jesus looked like what modern Jews look like today.

t1_duuzfxp	0	*	She's a witch!
t1_durb0yn	1	*	We are far from experiencing what Venezuela is going through. One of our biggest issues right now is addressing trans people but their preferred pro-nouns. I THINK  WE ARE GOOD.  
t1_dutni3j	1	*	He wasn't dead. Just drunk and naked. 
t1_dui7ofu	1	*	From some of my UK linving friends I can say they feel very similarly - the only difference is they earn more with higher costs of living than in Greece. But since this fall is mostly pronounced only among the young the older generation scoffs it off by saying the young are lazy etc.
t1_duncdq0	1	*	I think it's the sheer volume of straws produced. I live on a coast and by far straws are the most common piece of trash I see when walking on the beach. They are also a little more unnecessary in a lot of circumstances. So the volume plus lack of need makes a good place to start.

t1_duj3w3z	0	*	Two wrongs do not make one right
t1_duv9xnv	0	*	My wife and I visited Haiti last year. While the whole thing was a lesson in culture shock, one of the biggest things that stood out to me was how there was trash EVERYWHERE. Almost literally, every street and ditch and walkway and alley were covered in garbage. It was like nobody felt any pride for their homes or community, so nobody bothered to clean it up. 
t1_duy488f	0	*	You're not wrong, but Korea does it as well. They still deny that their soldiers raped Vietnamese women in the Vietnam war.
t1_duus0xa	1	*	Italy is a parliamentary republic, not a presidential one.  That means that people elect the Parliament and then the President nominates a Prime Minister with the support of the Parliament.   For obvious reasons he usually chooses the leader of the party who won the elections but technically there is nothing that inhibits him to literally pick a random guy instead as long as Parliament agrees with that decision. 
t1_dujd5t3	1	*	Desalination is not a very cost-effective process at the best of times. Having to build a desalination plant in a hurry probably wasn't the first thing people thought of.

t1_dute1w8	1	*	In this case, probably less a full term.
t1_duh0vs6	1	*	It's not about glossing over it. It's more like 'please don't take this shit seriously and act on the crazy shit he says he's not actually in charge'.

t1_dui4ayi	1	*	at least theyre not DETROIT.....THEYRE NOT DETROIT!
t1_dud5amq	1	*	Of course he will lol...Thats why I dont give a shit about this news. Literally nothing significant will happen because of this or change. Just something to eat popcorn to then go about our lives.
t1_dustbfk	1	*	Now? The stank is at least a decade old, just like in WW1 and WW2, the events already happened, you're all just figuring out about it now. :))
t1_duqo9qg	1	*	> during a proffer session  FROM THIS MONTH. He actively lied this month.
t1_duftfdq	1	*	They don't even need to bother. Most of Reddit spreads their bullshit without a second thought.

t1_dueogfl	1	*	> It was the DNC, who took Hillarys bribes, and this IS common knowledge that is actually proven  Uh, are you ok?
t1_duphbk3	1	*	Well, it's a start. Still doesn't make up for the past *oopsies* 
t1_duzlh29	1	*	Ch'Ch'Chia Pets!
t1_duj5kl7	1	*	A good person couldn't look at themselves in the mirror after doing this, but these... things... they spend their careers doing it and feeling righteous about it, superior for doing it, and even that they're doing the world a favor and thus are owed even further for their troubles.  They sleep like baby rocks.
t1_dusi9te	0	*	Most of Mexicans hate Pexf1a Nieto. He is corrupt, part of an old corrupt party, and basically a puppet. I'm not sure if I would be proud that a super douche puppet had anything to say really. The PRI party is ultra corrupt.
t1_dudh7vj	1	*	i think that's naive, maybe the Olympics didn't have the expect ROI but overall societal problems of institutionalized corruption, generational poverty and crime culture aren't solved in a couple of years or even decades. 
t1_duqbqx4	1	*	Honestly I hope they find Dem money too. Harder for the right to paint this as a witch Hunt.
t1_duw09df	0	*	Step 1: It did not happen. There is no proof  Step 2: Well, maybe it happened, but are you sure we are causing it?  Step 3: Ok, it happened and we are the cause, but it is too late now so let's keep doing it.  Step 4: ???  Step 5: Earth profits because the disease called human just got destroyed.
t1_duy1xgq	1	*	Maybe palestinians should try a different moveset other than Rage, Swagger, Substitute & Self-Destruct ?
t1_dusvwbq	1	*	Countries all over the world are currently electing people who are running on a anti-US platform.  The US can't just sweep this one under the rug.  When Trump goes away, he will leave a world full of governments and people like Hugo Chxe1vez.  
t1_duy9mmd	1	*	The US had McCarthyism which claimed that American youth were being subversively manipulated by Communist ideology.  Russia has an opposing belief that American Capitalism influences Russian youth. It's not that they hate lesbians, they're just not big on potentially CIA backed propaganda being used against them.
t1_dutfgfv	0	*	America pretending to be about democracy is also old. American here.

t1_dukp8gm	1	*	At work, what is it?
t1_duq3oj7	1	*	Why dont you do it yourself
t1_dui950a	0	*	So your argument is government should be primarily funded by those willing to pay for it?  That's a good way to lose the few voices of reason while the rest take advantage while asking for, yet bigger, tax breaks.   That guy over there picked up the tab,  so I'll just take my cash back. Thanks.    What Mr. Gates is requesting is fairness.  What your offering is the opposite.

t1_dugvolw	1	*	Correct.

t1_dushjet	0	*	Its pathetic that people are okay admitting theyre Reagan Republicans. 
t1_duypvav	1	*	How cold is it in Russia today? 
t1_dua4yvl	1	*	The US has less homicides per 100,000 people than most countries that size / population. They are actually doing better in that regard than many. Plus at this point I honestly think any sort of real government intervention on their guns may actually all jokes aside lead to a civil war.
t1_dubm08k	1	*	Yep. Thats why I upvoted it. 
t1_dusinw6	1	*	You in Alaska? I'm curious about the state of the sea ice.

t1_dutwccg	1	*	Because my baby can get it from those people before he is vaccinated, and die from it. So yeah, I care. That's in addition to the risk of mutation mentioned below, which is how diseases can become epidemics. Not sure a non-expert saying I don't see how carries any weight against the risks outlined by scientists and doctors.
t1_dum4o86	1	*	> as pretense that Russia's democratic in the slightest.  The guy is financed by the US, it's election meddling, the guy should register as a foreign agent.

t1_dur3exx	0	*	Interesting but surely Japan still take on the credit risk here? I guess they bet that the government would invest it in the right things and it paid off in the end.

t1_dusissv	1	*	Funny but it doesnt take much thought to realize the type of security clearance a landscaping company would need for that job so Im sure whoever is doing it is a citizen at the very least, skin color irrelevant.
t1_dur12fc	1	*	Natural poh-lease
t1_dui7wlk	1	*	The problem with that idea is that it's easier to buy members of congress who are morally weak, and thus aren't interested in the greater good of the nation. They are greedy, and want to appeal to their voter base (the religious right) so they can stay in power 
t1_duphmzg	0	*	Yes there was a time when Germany had a strong military in the past and they abused it. Imagine if all the other countries (Allies) had followed your pacifist template today. The new timeline would have been vastly different 
t1_dugf19j	0	*	Is it inappropriate to suggest sedatives for such... disturbed children?

t1_duhzaec	0	*	Yes send a United States citizen to a country known for It's corruption and the highest execution rates of any country in the world. Nice. 
t1_dut2jdf	1	*	Well the currently ruling regime has always been authoritarian, Russia has always been authoritarian. So we aren't seeing anything different other than history repeating itself 
t1_dustt1c	1	*	No. Just some crazy Americans think that any regime will bend because of sanctions. Americans get their experiences from movies and TV shows. 
t1_duhdt97	0	*	I am kind of surprised that he isn't Secretary of something.
t1_duxp1aw	1	*	Sure that. It is all about men. Women are property.

t1_dusj0th	1	*	> I just don't understand how people can be so cruel, uncaring, and ignorant.  It's simple -- stupidity has caused more harm to humans than outright malicious sociopathy.  Remember the dark ages? Yeah.
t1_dufh1m4	0	*	Brexit passed because the people of the UK wanted to take back control of their borders. Even a visit from the prophet Obama himself couldnt sway the decision. Trumps win had a lot to do with borders too.

t1_dug8x5q	1	*	There's a newspaper in Korea owned by the sum of many tiny little individual shareholders so that it's not at the whims of big corporations or big government. Probably the least corporate affected newspaper in Korea, but like all newspapers in Korea, it's essentially funded by advertisers. And who are the advertisers? Corporations.  I don't see any easy ways out of this.
t1_dujx0yi	1	*	I'm not generally surprised to hear that Trump contradicted himself. But if you read the article with open mind, the evidence in this case is weak to non-existent. The fact that they rated it Pants On Fire, and that you swallowed it whole without blinking, only hurts your position.
t1_duawjs8	0	*	Oh no. Its retarded.

t1_duw0npe	1	*	> look at the figures  They skip that part entirely.

t1_dux82ww	1	*	People don't realize that's what will happen to NorthWest Europe as global warming increases. They seem to think England will become Spain.
t1_duds58y	1	*	My words exactly. No one seems to get that being an asshole is still being an asshole if it's towards Republicans, Trump or whoever it's trendy to dislike nowadays. The principles everyone claims to stand for apparently don't apply if you're being a prejudiced dick to a conservative. Damn shame 
t1_duyla0g	1	*	Wasn't there an article that talked about a women in jail in Aisa who says she has information on Putin and Trump. Might be a stretch, but she may be the one doing the peeing or at least she was there.

t1_dujo9kg	1	*	Probably around the same numbers as politifacts credibility.

t1_duojazg	1	*	I think there are certain conservatives in western countries that want to undermine democracy. Young people increasingly vote progressive or liberal, which in a few decades means the end of right wing parties.   That's why Trump and the republicans asked for help from Russia to influence the election. They can't win unless they play dirty. Hillary won the popular vote by 3 million and lost the electoral college by just under 80 thousand votes.

t1_duuu054	0	*	I think all censorship should be deplored. My position is that bits are not a bug That we should create communications technologies that allow people to send whatever they like to each other. And when people put their thumbs on the scale and try to say what can and cant be sent, we should fight back - both politically through protest and technologically through software  Aaron Swartz (1986 - 2013) //Replace c with r in the url to see how many post reddit is censoring//

t1_duw0w2g	0	*	its funny, but before President Trump took office, reddit never really discussed climate change. After he took office and his position became  public on climate change, posts about climate change became very common with the top threads always about the President and always negative.

t1_duszq4d	0	*	How do you guys not know that China isn't a democracy? It never was.  The people only elect local leaders. All other leaders are nominated by the party.  By all descriptions, China is a socialist fascist state, and it has been for well over a decade.
t1_dup0kxd	0	*	Actually, the Dutch government just recognized it as a genocide today(Thursday). It's new news. It ok if you havnt figured how time works though, it's a super duper tough concept to understand and you seem like the kind of person who would have trouble with it. 
t1_duanjs5	1	*	The legal system is a clusterfuck of rules and procedures.

This new plan though is a huge step as identified by international anti-money laundering organizations that have identified Canada as being particularly weak in this regard.   If it's done to score cheap political points, well, in this case the interests of slimy politicians and the people they represent are actually aligned for once.

t1_duxpg0z	1	*	Yea man I mean they just reading the title not the news itself
t1_duly6c3	1	*	Also, everyone likes to forget that ***the vote was non-binding***.
t1_ductsj3	0	*	It's a fucking cash crop.   They're not cutting down millions of hectares of rain forest because the locals are in desperate need of cooking oil. They're doing it so they can sell palm oil to the rest of the world.
t1_duui9s1	0	*	> That's OK  No, that's 279K.  Also, this is due to some twisty turny thing happening in the atmosphere. Where I live, it's cold as frick as a consequence.
t1_durbe6o	1	*	Sad as it was, the atomic bombs were necessary and, oddly enough, was a good thing for Japan in the long run. 
t1_duhl7jc	1	*	It didnt, 1500 years is just how far back the data goes.
t1_duizo2h	1	*	Yup
t1_duwd8ip	1	*	Really goes to show how badly the poor people afflicted with Trump Derangement Syndrome are suffering when they compare China -- an authoritarian single party communist state that's headed toward dictatorship -- with the democratically elected president of the US. 
t1_duebohi	1	*	This guy thinks being allowed to listen to SK music without getting kidnapped means peace is on its way lmao.
t1_duph7ot	1	*	Except we borrowed the money to spend on said hammers and toilet seats.

t1_duafupw	0	*	> A storm in a tea cup.   English words often have similar meanings, but the nuances of the differences between synonyms can be important. The proper way to say this is A tempest in a teapot. It is easy to miss those small details when translating from  Russian to English.

t1_duphu5e	0	*	have harsher punishment on bullies then, being a bully? well clearly your not adult enough for your education.
t1_dujewi3	1	*	It was in the middle of an election year. And from what I have read Obama could have retaliated against Russia in a much more severe reaction.   Apart from Mitch McConnel's interference Obama had plans ready to go for the next president to take action. He didn't feel it was his right to start a massive cyber fight w Russia just as he was leaving office. And that fight would likely be ugly.

t1_duphiyl	0	*	You're welcome here :) 
t1_dugzdv2	1	*	Yep. Lots of government officials don't want things to change and they're afraid that whatever Trump's going to say, is what's going to replace them with more competent people.  And with the Trump hate train, everyone's saying, Good! Don't listen to him! I don't know anything about what he's doing, but I'm listening to CNN who lies all the time, and I find this one article on the internet that says he's doing bad, and I believe it too!
t1_duzgsro	1	*	Well, technically they couldn't find any. ;) 
t1_dujl1ak	1	*	Yeah, he would.
t1_duqnpj1	1	*	You could also write the same story from the palestinian perspective. The fact that you consider just the poor israeli soldiers is whats so annoying about you israeli internet brigades. Defending stupidity at all costs.
t1_duvui38	1	*	Definitions change based on whats convenient to the person using it. Remembers when a troll was anyone who didn't like you.
t1_duwleed	1	*	Plus it makes for an amusing dare for drunken locals and students. Best we ever managed was an 8 foot tall appendage crafted from snow, shitfaced at 3am and deciding blocking the chancellor's parking space with a giant cock was a worthy pursuit. Imagine being able to say you rang Hitler's bell. 
t1_dun73no	1	*	As someone not in the US I rather welcome the occasional story from there.
t1_duw8n6g	1	*	If its quake I guess you mean .PAK

t1_dudt39b	0	*	I use lidar in my job as a flooding and water engineer. We all hate it. All it does is crash our PCs and waste our time.
t1_duskpaa	1	*	It's only pathetic if you voted for him. Also, Trump is really humiliating himself. He promised something utterly ridiculous.
t1_duq49dz	1	*	its just a cheap repeat of previous stories that has long since been debunked, yet amazingly people here takes everything at face value without questioning anything.
t1_duum9mj	1	*	Never forget that you are someone.

t1_duvgvfn	1	*	That really isn't how missiles, nuclear combat or ballistics in general work, but sure.
t1_dud0vcb	1	*	 Defendants made various expenditures to carry out those activities, including buying political advertisements on social media in the names of U.S. persons and entities. Defendants also staged political rallies inside the United States, and while posing as U.S. grassroots entities and U.S. persons, and without revealing their Russian identities and ORGANIZATION affiliation, solicited and compensated real U.S. persons to promote or disparage candidates. 
t1_duigh71	1	*	A push for socialized medical assistance makes it worse.   Imagine if private pharmeceutical companies were competing? This would not be happening.
t1_duafps7	1	*	So basically the diet of every 1st world country that doesn't live off of their own homegrown. 
t1_dujk4bf	0	*	I'm starting to think they've put 'm there to destroy all believe in government and politics, so they can privatize everything cheaply soon.
t1_dupimow	1	*	Because the surplus doesn't arrive at the citizen. Source... I am German and don't see how I profit.
t1_dutm88c	1	*	You had better not have kids. If you do I hope they are taken away because you are a terrible person and not fit to be a parent.  I have my fingers crossed that you are sterile. Upset by that? That's fine. Your feelings don't matter. You opinion doesn't matter. You are too stupid for anyone to take seriously.
t1_dulsn6r	1	*	Really nice strawman you got there. 
t1_duqarud	1	*	Are we pretending the NRA isn't a huge bullhorn to a very particular voting bloc?
t1_duxllar	0	*	thats a great catch
t1_dup1wb5	0	*	Because many members of ND are now in SYRIZA and the whole case had been going until two years ago when Tsipras was in charge.
t1_duj09u0	1	*	I laughed for real
t1_dugbtkf	1	*	I think people need to understand that Eritrea is not Ghana. Whatever someone getting out of Eritrea is, it's the same as someone getting out of North Korea. If you want to call them migrants I suppose you technically can, but I imagine you'd think it quite horrific to send the North Korean version back to *their* labour camps.   Actually, you can make a pretty decent argument that Eritrea is WORSE than North Korea. 
t1_duhv8uq	1	*	*He
t1_duwcvvt	1	*	We can publish graphs and scientific data ad infinitum; this doesn't seem to be getting us anywhere.  I think we need more scientists examining climate change solutions via behavioral sciences like sociology & economics.  
t1_dulwsnc	0	*	The El Mozote massacre was Reagan's proudest moment.  True conservative values were expressed there. 
t1_dui94oh	1	*	Similar to what Rockefeller did as well. He was very Christian and was under the impression that god wanted us to get as rich as we could so we could share more - and he gave a *lot* but was tough getting there.
t1_duqpdvs	1	*	Trump surge - then we bring them home and he claims victory - best victory ever!
t1_dud855d	1	*	They can have their forgien property confiscated, and can't travel to Europe anymore and visit their Spanish Villas
t1_dui8s0d	1	*	This but unironically
t1_duweo4y	1	*	I mean, a lot of this stuff is just gathering training data and running  it through computers for learning.  I'm sure the data will accumulate quickly.  If you've been following the deepfake news, you'll notice that if you have access to enough photos of someone (trump on google images, for example), you can create convincing algorithms (if you have the hardware and patience).
t1_dudtsjd	1	*	> company will come up with a similar product at less cost  They literally can't because of IP laws
t1_duwd0rx	0	*	what do they do if they do not want a dictator?
t1_duyv6m6	1	*	Remember Frost/Nixon?  What I would give for Paxman/Trump, although it would be a total bloodbath and nobody with any sense would let Trump near Paxo.
t1_duw5sar	1	*	I mean I don't want dissuade you, but an individual can't do anything, so might as well enjoy nice things now. Nuclear power both fission and fusion are the only realistic ways to substantially reduce emissions now (with the fusion being a research goal). It's a problem that got turned political. You have one side ignoring it and the other getting donations from people that are scared and confused by anything nuclear. 
t1_ducmh0v	1	*	they'll just sick japan at them. and japan will once again come under a mushroom cloud for it.
t1_dupjx60	1	*	Taxes were a little bit reduced this year, hope this trend continues.
t1_duq8bvs	1	*	Let's see if it pays off for them, Cotton.
t1_duqxfu5	1	*	The narrative there is currently as one-sided as its ever been. 100% shitting on the Broward county sheriffs department and little to nothing else. Not one single post about this triple nothingwhopper supreme with cheese. Until Putin wakes up, I doubt theyll have an official narrative.   Scum, really. 
t1_duh46s7	1	*	Yep, thats how reporting works.
t1_duwdyn8	1	*	Yeah and the narrative has shifted from outright deny climate change is happening to climate alarmists, as in, its happening but you nancys are over reacting 
t1_duvl8pl	1	*	We now have a president who's basically an angry twitter troll. 
t1_duz9scn	1	*	Trees are renewable. You can grow more of them.   Paper will ultimately biodegrade.  Plastic never breaks down. As in, EVER.   Glass is great.    Disposable and COMPOSTABLE bio-based containers, plates, utensils, and straws are ideal as well. 
t1_duefl5h	1	*	Blackwater is called Academi now. Their parent companies Constellas Group/Triple Canopy are headquartered in my area.
t1_duhckbg	0	*	Problem with Wikipedia imo is that sometimes the translations contain cultural bias which lead to different conclusions depending upon which language you read an article in. I think this is going to be a difficult problem for them to solve.
t1_duyf29b	1	*	It also goes against what was agreed in the draft negotiation last year.

t1_ductvnx	1	*	Ive been having to do this a lot lately. Its a constant battle of is this person worth my time or will me engaging with them possibly help someone else not buy into their bullshit?   Social media has become so fucking draining in the past year. Theres hardly any discourse, just fights with people that are probably intentionally trying to get people heated.

t1_dubp6o7	1	*	The goal is the same as every wedge issue always has been: create and deepen divisions other than the central division. The only societal division that matters. Working class and ruling class.
t1_duj2hxl	1	*	Hell, it's had an impact in the US. Even with the Russian BS people still had to decide which person to vote for. They fell in line and voted for the pussy grabber because gay people are evil. 
t1_duq9o5y	1	*	He also liked to drink tea and drive his prehistoric chariot on the left side of the road while humming God Save the Queen.

t1_dust93z	1	*	How would you do that, and how would that be equivalent to Mexico paying for a wall? Many people who are sending money are Americans.
t1_duip9gp	1	*	Thats not a pet of Russia, that IS Russia.
t1_duerl8p	1	*	When was the last time any major politician was an economist? I would vote are real economist in so fucking fast. If Trump could get in, anyone could get in.
t1_ducffcb	0	*	As a student, I attended a birth of a women who refused to push because of the pain. No position changes, back massaging, or coaching could change her mind. First kid to a young mother. Fully dilated and could feel the baby's hair, wasn't too big or malpositioned. Doc just shrugged and took her to C-section. So now she had a painful abdominal incision and longer recovery...

t1_dui8oy7	1	*	Actually they would. There's no way to give a donation to the government. Plus, he actually gives away a huge portion of the money he makes today to various charities. I'm not saying he lives in squalor or anything, far from it in fact, but if there's one person you really can't rag on for not being charitable enough, it's Bill Gates.

t1_duxs5sp	1	*	I feel like the middle ground here is giving them the choice to either wear it or not. That's supporting them by treating them as human beings with a right to choices.
t1_dukho8x	0	*	Syria is backed by Russia and Iran 
t1_duipeeh	1	*	I voted remain but now we have our foot in the door, i'd vote leave. Fairly selfishly as well because with my degree i'm fairly confident in my employability while the generally old and less educated will be the ones to bear the main brunt of the fallout. Bad luck for the Northerners who voted remain though. 
t1_dujh4t3	1	*	Like CIA funded terrorists.
t1_duova5q	1	*	Way to create a strawman. his idea was to let teachers who want to carry , carry.      Because it's not like any teachers are former military or police. Or even both. I had a driving instructor in high school who was an ex-marine sergeant and ex state trooper. Is there any reason he shouldn't be allowed to carry? He still wore his hat in class sometimes, so why not his sidearm?
t1_duwhf7k	1	*	He's too scared to
t1_dulgwtu	1	*	I disagree. Lookingthrough my daughter's religion school book, there is a page, maybe two, dedicated to religions other than christianity with basically a basic summary of the ideas and people. And if you want to learn about Buddhism, you have to go to the website. And the other hundred or so pages is all Christianity.
t1_dua5k2p	0	*	simply changing a law wont make guns in america disappear  people in europe seem to think laws are magical and everyone obeys them  if a kid has access to an automatic gun - then no law is going to stop them - tho we can make it hard for individuals to get access to such excessive weapons

t1_duq1b25	1	*	> The expropriation of land without compensation is envisaged as one of the measures that we will use to accelerate the redistribution of land to black South Africans.  They entire point is just to remove white people so they can give the land to ANC supporters. It's a corruption move and there will be no compensation. 
t1_dunybin	1	*	No, this stopping of the issuing merely will translate out as the women will be persecuted and killed more than likely. The House of Saud just wants to wash their hands of it I think.

t1_duodf2t	1	*	No, that's fake news he never said he wants to give guns to teachers. Wait I'm just getting word that he said the problem will vanish if we arm the teachers.
t1_dutgqh7	1	*	my theory is that Trump et al would be perfectly happy if the US was more like Russia  The thing I don't understand is why,to a man,the administration/campaign officials lied about their Russian contacts if it were all so innocent?
t1_duyh098	1	*	not everything is about america
t1_ducskg9	1	*	I have a simpler method. If someone's entire post history is political diatribe and they post hundreds of messages a day, then they are one of three things: a shill, a bot, or a nutcase.

Then start a 'this is an evil terrorist, lets bomb her and her family in East Ghouta' and then start a social media campaign calling for their extermination.  Anything else I am missing?
t1_ducrqqi	1	*	Yeah they use the term unwittingly to describe the way campaign officials would interact with Russian's posing as others. Trump's entire operation appears to criminally stoopid.

t1_duvpr83	1	*	No, you're thinking of Putin.
t1_duje4xu	1	*	I really don't know how zoos are legal.  Conservation safaris are what we need to be doing.
t1_dur0alo	0	*	Your first amendment actually gives people the right to protest, so Gucci are actually upholding your constitution.
t1_dur6dwr	1	*	This is entirely understandable, lots of people are confused as to why their father has any position in the federal government. 
t1_duyrkt4	0	*	By that logic, America should retract all Native American reparations and reservations and tell then to move on because all actions were completed by previous generations.   Or more to your point, America should deny it happened and criticize anyone that demands recognition that it did happen. 
t1_duui7xc	1	*	First you have to have an election... Like a real one...
t1_dunjrqf	0	*	Mostly the illiterate in the muslim world buy into this bs.
t1_duttpbz	0	*	This is part that i dont understand about russia, what's the point of an election if you eliminate all oppositions? If i were putin i'll do what xi jinping does, unless putin thinks russian people are more stupid than chinese people.
t1_duws57h	1	*	Especially if they start a war.
t1_dug2lno	0	*	Unless you're the US
t1_duvbp03	1	*	In my experience, they have no self-awareness or self-reflection and facts don't matter. I've literally been told that wherever I heard Trump had filed multiple bankruptcies for his businesses was lying. Verifiable facts are called lies.
t1_dujdkqm	1	*	No, instead Trump's people would be saying how he was right about the elections being rigged against him. Remember? How he claimed the elections were bad, rigged and he wouldn't accept the results?
t1_dulsnqh	0	*	Idk. Despite what I feel many Filipinos support him. I mean, look at the Wikipedia for the death squads-the citys residents actually approve of them 
t1_duxyj5c	0	*	How's it any different than us here in America? The rich & powerful do what they want with impunity and no fear of any actual punishment. We have the CIA flying in cocaine by the TON. Planes of it, all while we're 'engaged' in a War on Drugs. Differnt location, different actors, but it's the SAME PLAY.  
t1_duhw2o1	0	*	Quebec provincial government is doing this now and it's so obviously a vote grab tactic.  Especially after hearing them cry AUSTERITY for a few years now and saying that they need to make cuts.  Now we have a bit of surplus and what do they do: bribes. Bravo. Not paying down the debt or investing in the services that need it. No, votes are more important :P
t1_dubwaah	1	*	Why can't you be rich and be real?
t1_duvlyr9	1	*	No wonder it was so damn cold in Calgary. 
t1_dud2flc	1	*	yeah ... oh wait ... republicans start wars    relevant username btw!
t1_dufkjqu	1	*	I totally agree! 
t1_dua3eqw	0	*	well the EU is currently in the process of making one of the biggest economic deals ever with japan..
t1_duy96ot	1	*	Thats not going instigate things at all. 
t1_dusxy1u	1	*	And those people are going to disappear. 
t1_dula2dx	1	*	The protestant schools are as bad. 
t1_dunm5zh	0	*	The planet will be fine for a few billion years. It's our habitable climate that's being threatened by science denying bumpkin dopes.
t1_duu9x1e	1	*	Snowed 3 times in Houston...
t1_duug8gi	1	*	Even just not building a enormous steel warehouse would be a vast improvement. 
t1_dudf6nt	0	*	yes, while Blackwater mercenaries get free passes cuse they're the american good guys
t1_duqm0l1	1	*	 And not a good one.
t1_dug1iin	0	*	Free markets would also say that if China skyrockets the price of steel some entrepreneur in the US would start producing it again. Steel production isn't exactly magic. 
t1_duj9ebk	1	*	Doesn't military conscription do that?
t1_duzh8a4	1	*	All these shinny buildings and things you see in China look really nice from 100ft away but when you get close to them you see how poorly built their are. This is from the outside not so sure about the structure though. Maybe these small seemingly cosmetic issues can be take care of in the future. 
t1_duidak1	1	*	Pretty much anybody who's not balls deep in the russia conspiracy theory can see how silly it is to suggest low quality memes could have had any effect on the election.        Oh.. nevermind that part... they said in the statement there was no effect.  And no collusion.
t1_dujmyyr	1	*	How many times have you eaten bread in your life?
t1_dui89bz	1	*	If Bill Gates goes against his own best interest, saying he should pay more, people herald him as a hero. When people say they don't think it's right to take rich people's money at higher rates simply because they're rich, you're vilified and seen as stupid.
t1_ducbbu1	1	*	It will encourage people to kill people who aren't NPA rebels for the bounty and claim they were rebels once they're too dead to defend themselves. It's called [the cobra effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobra_effect).
t1_dui6fhb	1	*	You know that's not what he was getting at. Unless you didn't actually read anything he said in which case your comment is completely irrelevant.
t1_duij787	1	*	Refugee plants.
t1_dulc109	0	*	It is not UNICEF's job to describe anything.  Their job is to mitigate the hunger and disease of children.  The UN itself has tried to condemn Syria's actions many times, only to be rejected by Russia in the security council.  In that UNICEF can find no words to say about the murder of children in Syria is quite telling regarding the scale of this horrendous act.
t1_duribxf	0	*	Japan might not be explicitly claiming to be victims of WWII but their insistence on highlighting their suffering more than atoning for their war crimes doesn't paint a pretty picture.
t1_duypqlf	0	*	> Spelling is different but I think the pronunciation is the same.  I thought Mueller was pronounced mew-ler? 
t1_duzcwam	1	*	You giving them more credit than they deserve. They are in trouble of their own making, and unlikely either of them meant to go against Russia, they just did stupid shit, and now trying to play whatever cards they have left to stay alive. I have zero sympathy to them
t1_duq271c	0	*	Why hasn't this been given gold yet?
t1_dugcl2p	0	*	What do you spend 4k on in Angola?
t1_dusaypr	0	*	More Rothschild propaganda! Thats what we need!

t1_dulls6s	0	*	he looks like an android that is afraid of lobsters
t1_dun967m	1	*	Nice
t1_duskngt	1	*	Kanye 2020 
t1_durhgiy	1	*	next implies that something will happen in the future instead of something that is already occurring
t1_duwsd1y	1	*	I read that there are around 15 million Diesel cars in Germany. And probably like 2/3 will be affected.
t1_duq4jh1	1	*	I mean we knew about this before the satellite images
t1_dunvdjp	1	*	midwest US here, large sweet tea is in a Styrofoam cup, that's the only thing I know of.
t1_dumgg67	0	*	Convicted not charged but yes
t1_dui7lfx	1	*	Because then the poorest would have a massive tax increase from where they currently are as would huge chunks of the middle class. 
t1_dul3m5n	1	*	>The Philippines supports Duterte. Constant, desperate digs by Internet socialists are irrelevant.  Wasn't he a communist and now running the country like he is Mao? Who gives a shit about due process?? Drug dealer!! Bang*
t1_duo6nl3	1	*	Incepted like you read about, wow
t1_duobu6u	1	*	I enjoy this more than when British royalty has a child. 
t1_duhy9zi	1	*	No, no, it's a sex manual for people who are 300 years old.  The witchcraft comes in with the whole 'being dead' thing.  
t1_dulc2jg	1	*	Mine was solely for doing homework. 
t1_dusgwuo	0	*	About as pathetic that I'm an American, a pacifist socialist liberal, debating my Republicans friends that the Russians infiltration of our government may be a bad thing and that we should trust our FBI.
t1_duhlf86	1	*	Much of the Netherlands was underwater, they claimed it from the sea. Dutch expertise in the matter is going to be very sought-after in the years to come. 
t1_dubqiq2	1	*	Considering how abysmal their engagement numbers on confirmed accounts, I dont think they even know how to gain traction. A bot that get retweeted twice isnt gonna do jack.
t1_dufqoph	1	*	Weve had two in only a week!
t1_durevg0	1	*	So you're justifying the US committing one of the most atrocious war crimes in history because Japan committed a war crime against another country? Somehow I get the feeling you don't actually give a shit about China and just enjoy any kind of moral justification in order to not give a shit about doing something so awful.
t1_dup4iak	1	*	Don't know why you are getting downvoted but these measurements are nothing in current year.  They are beyond easy to circumvent, this might have pissed some people off a few years ago but with most other platforms doing this already I don't see how these trolls (basically spammers) will have a hard time adapting.
t1_duamo86	0	*	/r/YouSeeComrade, is not about need for you, is about need for motherland.
t1_duzh0pw	1	*	Some places deserve the label shit-hole.
t1_dulh8fc	1	*	I agree. We should lower the drinking age to 16. 
t1_dumrdu0	0	*	Because it's not like any American city has a trash problem. That would mean you'd have to call America a shithole too
t1_dut4k6b	1	*	You should do an AMA, that's awesome. 
t1_dui9f9g	1	*	This is already the case, right? I think you may be misinterpreting the Apple overseas cash situation?  They earned that money by selling iPhones in Europe, and *cant* bring it back to the US without paying taxes.
t1_duphv5j	1	*	Tons and they hate Merkels success. 
t1_duqgmt1	1	*	The world's political and economic climate has been in upheaval for sometime, and the doomsday clock moved 30 seconds closer in January. [Link](https://thebulletin.org/timeline) for the curious.
t1_duvp8x1	1	*	a lot of slashing and burning  wish they'd just grow their own forest and not mess with the unique life saving fauna
t1_dub2yml	1	*	I read somewhere we've got even more guns than since before the ban, but the vast majority of them are bolt action and break action farmer and sporting tools, and we've made it enough of a pain in the arse to own them that most people don't bother.
t1_dujdzau	1	*	Emphasis on appears, he's not actually a strong leader. His foreign policy is virtually non-existent and he's not doing anything to defend the country from attacks, even after 13 people were indicted. 
t1_duh6kmf	0	*	Why doesn't Trump do anything to stop Russia funding NK Nuclear weapons program?  Why doesn't Trump do anything about Russia arming Taliban that kills American Soldiers?  You are asking me to side with Trump who allows Russia to kill AMERICAN SOLDIERS. THAT SHIT DON'T SIT RIGHT WITH ME. You are either Pro America or Russia. If the latter move to Russia if you love it so much.
t1_duap3co	0	*	AURORAS ON AN OPEN FIELD, NED!
t1_dutx5r8	1	*	Both of those statements are wrong, it's due to rising atmospheric CO2
t1_dudx9tc	0	*	> Nonsense absolutely nonsense. If that was a population of 100,000. How come a few boats defeated them? 100,000 would have routed cannons and blunderbuss.  Well, when half, or more, of that population gets brought low by sickness/plague...
t1_dur8wlu	0	*	Emotion tends to be more decisive than reason even to the most rational people. Whether we like it or not that's how people ultimately vote.
t1_duagxcx	1	*	Eh yeah our presidency looks out of control, but really it's just business as usual. Most people don't really care as long as they can keep up the status quo in their lives or do better. Right now it's the latter. Most  Everyone in the US who works is about to receive a bump in their paycheck. The economy is going strong, my investment and retirement accounts are just crushing the S&P 500. Things are pretty good right now.
t1_duvt4lj	1	*	[Cod Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cod_Wars), between Iceland and Britain.
t1_dus8thq	0	*	Safer, in terms of not getting arrested because one file somewhere had something remotely critical in it. I'd say it's better in that aspect.
t1_dubcqus	1	*	I have to do this in Nashville. I don't understand how Tennessee wins awards for its streets every couple years they are terrible. 
t1_dutczha	1	*	Because that's already been done and is the reason we have functional vaccines. The problem is people want to have that conversation despite having no background in anything related to vaccine development and the massive number other fields needed to make it functional. There has to be a limit to how much say someone with no knowledge is allowed it to have in certain matters, and in the case of kids dying due to some people's actions, it should be none.
t1_dujkol4	0	*	I think trump WILL be exposed as a pedophile with video proof and his base wont even flinch.   But Im excited to hear how they defend trump peeing on underaged girls. 
t1_dukx8uh	1	*	Don't worry he can always take a shower...
t1_dujxp72	1	*	Oh, dont start with that - the state often has to decide how to balance what is best for children and their parents.   This type of court case happens in both private and public health insurance settings, and is quite uncommon in both.
t1_duqzusb	1	*	I heard he doesn't like the taste of polonium-210.
t1_duv2bx0	1	*	What a strange combination of words there, fentanyl addict. I wasn't aware people survived to become addicted to the stuff. 
t1_duqd7ec	0	*	It's definitely the end of the beginning.
t1_duoj669	1	*	While Obama was certainly a more well spoken president, I think most people on reddit need to wake the fuck up and realize just how mediocre of a president he actually was. So because Obama was more polite and dignified when fucking over average Americans that makes him this amazing president? Fuck that. Democrat and Republican politicians have been screwing over average Americans for decades now. 
t1_duib1q1	0	*	Yes. It's about an even split between status quo, independence, and statehood. 
t1_dumhp53	0	*	> Russia is mean to people it doesn't like  You mean like invade and annex a part of the Ukraine?   > Today's Russia is a 13 year old popular middle school girl.  Do you honestly think killing and banning political rivals and journalists so you can run a dictatorship something new for russia or like some weak middle school girl moves? Lol.
t1_dunfg3t	1	*	RIP space travel.
t1_duyjou2	0	*	Where in the world did you see that 80-90% is credible? 
t1_dutnsif	1	*	Wut
t1_dupmh0z	1	*	At least for basketball no one goes through the full four years because of the possible risk factor or bad playing that could affect their draft stock.
t1_duxgyua	1	*	! Tabrnak, vous xeates gxe9niale !
t1_due941s	1	*	The justification for doing it is easy, the arguments against require a different mindset,I think.
t1_dujqd5k	1	*	In related news, cadet bone spurs lies about everything all the time.  Almost like he is a pathological liar.
t1_dual4br	0	*	I have some really bad potholes in my area should I do the same? I live in a pretty wealthy city but there's a historic/poor area of the city that gets neglected and I live by it while they add more houses to the rich cookie-cutter house side.
t1_dui1c3y	1	*	Some of their grandparents. Some of
t1_dui0tem	0	*	I do feel excessive regulation  is necessary sometimes 
t1_dupk4jw	1	*	Russian chefs give military orders because that way they can claim that they were non-military personnel if they get captured and use that as a basis to ask for leniency in sentencing if ever caught of war crimes. It's a very smart tactic to keep what are essentially their senior officers alive. /s
t1_dur8czt	1	*	I saw a post on 4chan of people sending a Venezualan food packages. He was excited to be able to eat split peas again
t1_duykvuw	1	*	Note that we don't know the ages of the prostitutes that were used.   I suspect they were under age because of the way Trump has spoken about underage girls, the people who he likes to surround himself with, and how he speaks about those people. 
t1_dujgwwh	1	*	They are currently working in building them, but they won't be done in time to save us from Day Zero
t1_dumfxwe	1	*	People breed corruption. Doesn't matter what the system is. If people are involved there is corruption at some level.
t1_dupobmd	1	*	I don't see a mention of Pakistan in FATF's declaration
t1_dux59lj	1	*	Because they don't contribute much to the air pollution within German cities, of which 60% are the result of the car traffic. And Diesels produce more pollution that petrol cars.
t1_dukfu2u	1	*	Shrinking national monuments and opening up their land to mining and drilling leases. Pushing for more offshore drilling, even along the coasts of states that rely on the industry and tourism from their coastal towns. Massive opening up of drilling leases for the gulf of mexico.
t1_duchfdt	1	*	My fist is shaking so hard that I can't even continue to shake it.
t1_dudzh4y	1	*	Comey is my homie.
t1_duwb112	1	*	Considering the proposal only covers vandalism, theft and threats, it would make a lot of sense to have it in troubled areas. By far the majority of these crimes are committed very close to home.  It's not punishing those who live in bad areas. It punishing those who made it into a bad area.  I have no idea if this would work but it's probably a lot better than looking the other way which is how the countries usually deals with these issues.
t1_dut0grb	0	*	China has been authoritarian since like 600 BC
t1_duy1bmv	1	*	ain't exactly acid but look up 1P-LSD
t1_dujegfe	1	*	Main problem with capitalism is that the end goal for any logical actor under this system is antithesis to the system itself.  End goal for any corporation is to have a monopoly to completely dominate the market, which conflicts with idea of capitalistic competition keeping everything cheap, sane and well made.  Sadly there are plenty of companies that are too big  to fall, some are keeping their competition barely alive so they stay under monopoly margin(based as % of market share)
t1_duhwgoo	0	*	SO SHUT UP AND DANCE! 
t1_dutfbiz	1	*	just go out and vote dude
t1_dulfwb0	1	*	Serious question: why shouldn't students study general religion and moral philosophy?  These are important areas, and having a background in ethics can go a long way to bettering one's personal decisions and being more conscientious in life.  It would also provide background to many different people's cultures and interests
t1_duou9wy	1	*	Some drugs appear to bring down the last inhibitions in people.           Some people snap when they go off their meds.               This science has to be studied properly.
t1_dudyskp	1	*	Its milked from the insurers raising premiums for all of us.  We need more knock off drugs
t1_dumj5rh	0	*	Sometimes i wonder why can it not just be that simple
t1_dut1340	1	*	Great, this better not give Trump any ideas..
t1_dudb0bc	1	*	I'd upvote you to +13 if I could, but it's -13 right now and it seems fitting. 
t1_ducl7u5	0	*	Sometimes people forget that investments are long term plans.
t1_dugwm0v	1	*	They are ambassadors, it's literally their job to get along with the US government on behalf of their country. 
t1_duzk17h	1	*	women are free to divorce men in Islam
t1_dujmbn0	1	*	this is a false claim though.  in the quote from the article, trump said this Russia thing with Trump and Russia is a made-up story,  referring to the collusion claim.  he also explicitly acknowledged that Russia may have meddled in the election, as they have done forever, as nobody has ever denied.
t1_duwgk5x	0	*	A person who uses unlawful violence and intimidation, especially against civilians, in the pursuit of political aims.  
t1_duqgx2g	1	*	No one ever accused Trump voters of being particularly intelligenteven Trump  [bragged](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2016/02/24/donald-trump-nevada-poorly-educated/80860078/)  about his uneducated voters....
t1_duwervo	0	*	You could of course provide them access to your shower so they could clean themselves and not smell as much, instead of just complaining about the smell. 
t1_dupei7q	1	*	Please don't stop the Japan-hate circlejerk with facts. 
t1_dugp2kv	1	*	The Russian investigation is bullshit says increasingly nervous Trump supporter as more of his aides get indicted. 
t1_duj5jsa	1	*	I know a Russian woman, Goth, vegan, ton of little things that don't seem to fit together and would make you think she's liberal. Shock and disbelief when she saw two men kissing in her German university, claiming that that has no space in public.
t1_duhl1h8	1	*	Let's be clear though, because sea ice floats, and already displaces its weight, sea ice melting does not cause a rise in ocean levels, only land ice, or glaciers do that.
t1_duq39yy	1	*	Really does depend how to define rape.  To some, Rape could be sex they had for something in return. I.e. I didnt want to fuck him but I wanted his money more  The usual standard idea of someone getting pinned against a floor gets greyed out quickly.
t1_dufpdmf	1	*	Pirates stay near coastal waters, South China Sea is just damn too big. 
t1_dus16ts	1	*	SA fought the Nazis, it even jailed the leaders of domestic pro-Nazi movements. Not sure where you get your history.
t1_dun9avr	1	*	Yassmin Abdel-Magied? 
t1_duj445t	1	*	WHAT?? You mean Hernando has been lying to me all this time??  ***HERNANDO!!***
t1_dum1qxh	1	*	People from the Philippines see him as a lord and their saviour 
t1_dubns9j	1	*	Then they would be supporting a side, wouldn't they?    I kinda get what you're saying but...How do you support a policy for division?  It's not like succeeding from the union is on the ballot.  
t1_dupetz0	1	*	The stock brokers are in Frankfurt mainly not Hamburg 
t1_dup39lg	1	*	Nah the Ganghis Khan thing was the Chinese. Because some where Asia and yellow color tone. 
t1_duy51ai	1	*	The constitution has not been amended. The resolution did not change the constitution, it passed the question of how to change the constitution in this fashion to a constitutional review committee, which will work out exactly what that means, and then presumably bring a final resolution to the house that will get voted on.  NB: Presumably 2/3s means 2/3s of a quorate house, not 2/3s of 400 seats.
t1_dua3u7d	0	*	I can't see the article since I'm at work, but I'd expect there to be a scientific study which has sound stats backing this up.  I'd hope an ANOVA, with p-values very near 0.
t1_dudy62c	1	*	No more new drugs then with retards like you and the rest running things.  Your policy of forcing people to do things at gun point would have severe unintended consequences. 
t1_duv3hjb	1	*	Thats quite serious then - he wasnt getting his cut and the perpetrators werent ever going to give him one
t1_duyzg1y	1	*	Right-wing in Brazil would sell the whole country if they could, right after they reinstitute military dictatorship.
t1_duhif4l	1	*	When reading him, always pay close attention to the wording.  He states before I announced.
t1_ducuiht	1	*	what you're accusing them of is making comments that might sway people into voting a certain way. If you're saying you think the election was decided by people who could be politically swayed by reddit or facebook comments, that's more of a damnation of our democracy than anything. 
t1_duidd76	1	*	Nope, NASA [agrees with Vox](https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/nasa-study-shows-global-sea-ice-diminishing-despite-antarctic-gains).
t1_dub1fci	1	*	So you condemn an entire nation because of the acts of a few?! The North Korean defector said in an interview that he knows that the West isn't evil, he had access to media and if given a chance, I bet that most North Koreans would be happy to have freedom too! But if no one starts building bridges instead of acting like children we don't get anywhere.
t1_ducpki6	1	*	It's like he thinks bold letters make genocide go *poof*
t1_duaxs6j	0	*	They predicted oil wars back in the 90s.....fact that social awareness ov3r this in the last 20 years still doesnt exist is mind boggling. 
t1_duk08u6	0	*	> So what are the odds that any of this actually ends up being linked directly to Trump?  Pretty high, considering his son has admitted to it, and Trump is already guilty of obstructing justice.
t1_dua435c	1	*	Its all about the money and power. Thats why children are being shot does not change the situation
t1_dufe7qw	1	*	Nuts aren't exactly eco-friendly.
t1_dumod7c	1	*	That trash is getting a royal ass whooping!

t1_dut0psf	1	*	Was it ever a democracy?
t1_du9tgc8	1	*	Most of that probably is dangerous, except the radioactive material. We know a lot about how radiation affects the body. The very small increase over normal background radiation doesn't make a difference.
t1_duwt1eu	1	*	As an American; this statement -- the concept, even -- is so alien to me that at first read my brain scrambled to find the catch (how are the doctors going to actually get the extra money but still look like they're being magnanimous). I'm so damn cynical these days; have nearly lost all hope. 
t1_duowxst	1	*	Pose a financial threat to the USA or pivot some more to China.  The USA supported Marcos  who has worse human rights violations thru and thru. Marcos was a staunch US ally.
t1_dunqhs4	1	*	How? Both China and Russia have been authoritarian for centuries. Also Trump isnt undermining democracy. I dont like what hes doing but its not like hes a dictator. This is all very melodramatic.
t1_dub1svn	1	*	Critical support for the brain worms
t1_duet5iu	0	*	Thank God this is the top comment. It's just a matter of time before folks beg the government to regulate media sources. Let's just push it back as long as we can. In America it will likely happen when a liberal president starts raving about fake news the same way Trump does. Then folks will talk about the false equivalency and how *this* time it's bad but before it was for the greater good.
t1_duoxphn	1	*	Name checks out. 
t1_duyhyw3	1	*	We the people.... - yeah, totally agree with you.
t1_duxggg4	0	*	You really think that they would be for trudeau?
t1_duf0cag	1	*	Lol I can't even find a date on the article. 
t1_duqcjvo	1	*	And if not, then someone at the Kremlin is laughing really hard right now.
t1_duo9g3y	1	*	Some are scared, some truly like current regime, some - do not care. It is practically impossible to estimate the numbers as most people will not tell the truth due to possible consequences, not necessarily from the government, but their coworkers. Russians know very well how to keep their mouth shut. They will only rise up if food runs out, and Russian economy is not there yet. 
t1_duht5ym	1	*	The team is the entirety of each countries athletes in this context
t1_duj9le3	1	*	https://www.wahlrecht.de/umfragen/  It isn't just one poll. For almost a month now the SPD have been steadily losing ground, while the AfD have been smart enough to keep their mouths shut.  Another fun fact? The INSA polls was closest to the German election results. Come on over to /r/Germany where we're also discussing it. 
t1_duyrarr	1	*	It's actually a real tweet.. O_O.. oh but for fuck's sake Donny..
t1_dutxx7h	1	*	I never understand how people can't understand why they're downvoted for asking questions with genuine agendas 
t1_dufdrcs	1	*	He should been locked up for life. But death sentence is an way to easy punishment for what he did. He doesn't have to be miserable for decades now.
t1_duogn3l	1	*	why ?
t1_dujnyqg	1	*	Thumbs up. The good thing about actually being honest is that I can now look at you when you say you can't stand Trump and think Ok, this guy seems to go about life honestly, and probably has valid concerns for not liking Trump. Either our opinions/values just differ, or he has thought of something I haven't. Regardless, something worth listening to.  Imagine a world like that... 
t1_dubph0w	1	*	I looked, but I have no context for how it used to look. Here's a helpful image with some history:  http://wwf.panda.org/_core/general.cfc?method=getOriginalImage&uImgID=%26%2AR%20%27%21%5EW5%0A
t1_duvukoo	1	*	People get worked up easily, though. He better run like hell.
t1_dud9otm	1	*	First video is from the one back in September.
t1_duqc1ld	1	*	First Ladies
t1_dumvc14	1	*	Boo!
t1_duazivq	1	*	That is poetic. 
t1_dui8v24	0	*	Flat tax disproportionally impacts the poor, accomplishing the opposite of what Gates is advocating for, a more progressive tax system.
t1_dun97s9	1	*	You think in places where single use plastic stuff is banned, people carry around a set of utensils an straws?
t1_duykrua	1	*	Let's say he did. So what? Want to break down your sex life for us?
t1_dujozbk	1	*	I am American and haven't seen any other Americans that hate Germany. In fact most Americans on worldnews hate Trump but they will agree Germany needs to increase spending for defense, it was a point even Obama made.
t1_duutake	0	*	Whataboutism.
t1_dugmfod	0	*	You need a longer time view before making these comments  ;)  Like Mao said when they asked him about the outcomes of the French revolution: it is too early to tell.
t1_durgs5q	1	*	Married couples already get a tax cut up to 50% of their income tax to have children, on top of that they spend 30-40 billions per year to parents to help them out.
t1_dud4377	1	*	Time to spin it on Hillary now
t1_dutr06d	1	*	Vaccines cause adults 
t1_duefif3	0	*	Republicans are *how* Russia overthrew American democracy.  Trump was polling in Goldwater territory before they seized control of social media and hacked voter registration databases.  He wasn't even viable. 
t1_dunth2b	1	*	His emails!
t1_duc1d6x	1	*	They used to this in Rome. It was a good idea then too.
t1_duufqsf	1	*	> They may have to face the kamma of their intentional volitions, but hopefully an end can be met without bloodshed and death.  Genocidal butchers can only be dealt with using bloodshed and death.
t1_duvdhc8	0	*	Youd think the countries hardest hit by measles wouldnt be Italy, Romania, and Ukraine then since they arent taking in so many immigrants compared to the rest.
t1_duewlyf	1	*	Terrorism happens to lots of peaceful countries.  Thats kind of what terrorists look for 
t1_duykoo6	1	*	I've never seen an Olympic mascot look anything like real though, so life must suck at every Olympic games...
t1_dub8ohm	1	*	Or, you know, maybe there are issues in the document they can't agree with?  Like prescribing conflicting definitions?
t1_duhj3a6	1	*	If you'd read the article you'd see that he tested positive for meldonium which increases blood flow and reduces heart rate.
t1_ducm41i	1	*	http://www.soc.or.id/
t1_dun0971	1	*	Is this a good time to introduce you to deepfakes?
t1_duyy8yf	1	*	There are years and years of future material being made here.  Books, movies, documentaries, case studies, etc.  It'll be insane.
t1_dufw87b	1	*	who up until a few days ago also didn't believe they interfered at all
t1_dul901n	1	*	It's still there as an optional subject, along with other stuff like Geography and History. You could argue they are all useful, just not mandatory. Some schools in Ireland were making it compulsory for all students to take religion to the Junior Cert. In our case, the school where our kids go had/have religion as a compulsory subject, but science is an option. Seemed a bit weird to me! 
t1_duj57cs	1	*	Israel has literally had child suicide bombers used against it. Unfortunately, children are weaponizable, and have the extra bonus of bringing bad press to your enemy. 
t1_duslzd4	1	*	I'm guessing some serious money laundering...
t1_dupg2ij	0	*	Just tell the prison inmates he's a child molester. Despite all the murderers and gang bangers inside the prison, they all have the moral sensibility not to touch kids, and if they find out that there's a diddler in their midst, they do not take kindly to that.  Suffice to say, he might not even make it out in 8 years, and if he does, he's gonna look hella different.
t1_duhyf0l	1	*	Wait till you find out what subsidiaries they own... Nothing really too special, but TechCrunch and HuffPo stand out.   The rest of their subsidiaries features: MapQuest, Gateway and CompuServe.
t1_dusvttn	1	*	Would you say this about a group that claimed to be Muslim and did something bad?
t1_dukdol3	0	*	Sure bud, this is all just trumpos 4D master plan....
t1_durnp45	1	*	It's repulsive how people always feel the need to compare suffering.
t1_dusr7t8	1	*	i'm hoping for a real revolution in china. show the world what a billion of free people can do if they want to!
t1_duiagqi	1	*	Wealth makes you reckless with money.
t1_dunq0ac	0	*	Mire than 10 years ago in the UK from my memory
t1_duhc7pb	0	*	And Netanyahoo raaaannn, Iraaannnn so far away. 
t1_duk8jx3	1	*	This might be the most accurate assessment of Trump I've come across.
t1_dusjppw	1	*	It was never a thing. It was just deflection by Trump fans to retcon the bullshit claims he makes.
t1_dufjxtc	1	*	~~meddles in foreign elections~~   overthrows democratically elected governments
t1_due8nrl	0	*	> Third isnt everyone innocent until proven guilty?  People don't *want* evidence, or innocent until proven guilty.  [They want people fired first](https://www.vox.com/2018/1/24/16930916/msu-president-resigns-nassar-sentencing-lou-anna-simon)
t1_dusgizw	1	*	Trump allowed Erdogan's men to beat American citizens in D.C. with no consequences...
t1_duvfpo1	1	*	I would love to hear your reasoning behind #1.
t1_duhs46x	1	*	Pure tradition from where he comes from.
t1_durowku	1	*	Well i mean we are a pretty stellar example of how effective it is? He couldve said fucking something. Malcolm turnbull is the least offensive, least adventurous pm weve had in a while. The guy does nothing. 
t1_duogedu	0	*	I think that's called history
t1_dur4oed	1	*	But the media keeps telling me to *only* care about whatever influence Russia may or may not have!
t1_dunqi2e	1	*	Fascism is capitalism in decay. When the temporarily embarrassed millionaires realize that its not temporary and that the American dream failed them, they look for someone to blame, usually its the minorities and immigrants.
t1_dukw5af	1	*	More violent? There were more protesters when the Israelis put up metal detectors.
t1_dufea16	1	*	yes, you are not understanding something here.
t1_duwkxjg	1	*	We should start looking for another planet.
t1_duor2y7	1	*	If this was Obama you American bois woulda hanged him.
t1_dut3wa7	1	*	Chinese people should start calling him the Dear Leader
t1_durzmk5	0	*	He runs mercenaries or soldiers? Because most Wagner mercs have little to no military experience. Also they have decent salaries for Russian standards (3k usd /month deployed) so I doubt the malnourished statement. 
t1_dugqi7u	0	*	Why does any country need a president anymore? 99% of the time all they are is a really massively expensive embarrassment. Are we really that stupid to give one other human so much power? I guess we are. 
t1_duyqaky	0	*	So you support taking refugees from The Middle East/South America too? 
t1_duiczo4	1	*	But we don't know if he has been trying or not. Maybe making a public statement like this is also part of him trying? He is just one person and he's not even a politician.   I might be wrong, but a typical politician will rather listen to someone trying to make him more money than the one that wants to do the right thing.
t1_dup47id	1	*	The reported story actually happened.    [Link](http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/970412/too-judgmental-says-pacquiao-as-trillanes-notes-20000-drug-war-deaths) from the Philippine Daily Inquirer, the biggest broadsheet in the Philippines.  Though the focus in this write up is more on Pacquiao being a Duterte stan.
t1_dulgprk	1	*	Why is it good that there are no longer classes focusing on the world's religions, philosophy, etc.?   Regardless of your personal beliefs, it's important to learn about what other people think.
t1_dujevob	1	*	babble.
t1_duthgaf	1	*	Seriously? Mongols complaining about the neighbouring countries?
t1_duopenp	1	*	And when will we find out why Skippy has all those artistic photographs of nude children in his house?
t1_dus38hr	1	*	Trying to teach a pig to sing is a waste of your time, and irritates the pig. 
t1_dukuzj9	1	*	Pathological liars like Trump don't know what words mean.  They just make the right noises with their larynx at any given time to try and get other people to do what they want... or to talk themselves out of responsibility for their actions.
t1_duv2pov	1	*	Well R.I.P
t1_dupjm1r	1	*	Pakistan is a not a member.
t1_dup9d4y	0	*	An entire states teachers are literally on strike right now because of [pay](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/education/wp/2018/02/22/i-dont-think-people-recognize-how-dire-it-is-west-virginia-teachers-strike-closing-all-public-schools/)
t1_duab6l7	0	*	Wrong. Japanese corporate heads think Brexit is bad for their business. They do not represent Britains best interest.   The fact that your ill informed statement got so many upvotes is a testament to how dumb and narrow minded the EU circlejerk is on Reddit 
t1_dudrdh6	1	*	Did you even read the article? It was a Swedish woman who got attacked by a man for refusing his advances at a bar. 
t1_dur6dcc	0	*	 It that it counts for much, but over the course of my career in the Marine Corps Ive always rated the highest level clearance, however, Ive only actually held it when my billet required me have that TS:SCI and Ive been in briefed.   Maybe thats the case here?  Granted I dont know enough about the situation to say, but I wouldnt put it past the media to make major news out of what should honestly be a non-story. 
t1_dueyphc	0	*	The nature argument is one of my biggest pet peeves in any situation. Nature isn't planned, it isn't what's best, and it isn't what's right. Nature is the genetic and circumstantial version of throwing shit on the wall to see what sticks. Following your logic congenital defects aren't bad.   I'm not trying to get into a circumcision debate. I'm just pointing out that your logic is really bad and it annoys me anytime I see this argument.
t1_duza5gu	0	*	Yeah, it's time to retire the -gate protocol for scandals.  I'll accept Trump-Russia (like Iran-Contra) and Russialago as options, and I'm open to suggestion.
t1_dubr5ww	0	*	Do you have a source for that? Just curious. Because it sounds very unlikely 
t1_dud8a7m	1	*	Wow it says they used stolen SSNs to pose as Americans. Sounds like we really do need voter I.Ds
t1_dugpzey	1	*	What's funnier is that Congress has the power, all these bad things and red flags that go up over what Trump is doing wouldn't happen if they had a Blue Congress with him
t1_dul8fc6	0	*	Philippine democracy being broken doesn't mean US democracy isn't flawed.  
t1_duujaei	1	*	Perhaps more comparable would be if one country started farming illegally on another country's land.
t1_duzh6i0	1	*	But to produce plastic you need the raw resources (oil) and then you need to manufacture and ship it. 
t1_dub0wft	1	*	A deal huh, I have a deal for you too then...as if Assad really had any choice, could he have forced Putin out? No. Syria is a failed state that will take a good part of ten years if not more to rebuild, where do you think they will get that money and the resources...Putin has Assad over a barrel (of oil that is)!
t1_durdl6b	0	*	0.16 is reaching nausea and blurred visions level of drunk. Ontario's limit is 0.08 for reference. It sucks that we get the drunken idiots breaking the laws at the Olympics this time.  Part of me hopes that SK moves forward with charges. Participating in the Olympics is not a carte blanche to flaunt the hosting country's laws and do anything you want.
t1_durjixv	1	*	> Why aren't the Trumpkins wailing at the mishandling of classified info   Because they don't think for themselves. They need to be whipped into a frenzy by Fox News, Breitbart and Info Wars. If these great institutions told them to they would storm their own grandmother's house with pitch forks and torches.
t1_duskxwn	0	*	Read the article.  The solutrean hypothesis is that europeans directly went to North America via an ice bridge across the atlantic, nothing to do with Caucasian tribes in Siberia.  And yes DNA testing has refuted the Solutrean theory as well. 
t1_duo8wsr	1	*	If it works, credit will be given. 
t1_dusxb8t	1	*	That's a pretty real possibility considering China is very deep into AI and other high tech stuff and utilizes them on a regular basis.
t1_dubz7xw	0	*	I was offered a c section and it terrified me because of the recovery and risks. Instead I asked to be booked in to be induced and have an epidural in case they needed to get my son out ASAP. Then from 37 weeks we tried to move things on naturally. I ate a pineapple a day, had sex every night and sat on my ball. It might have worked though! I went into labour at 38 weeks, the pineapple, sex and ball might not have had any difference but I like to think it did. 
t1_duu9qpa	1	*	Unfortunately we have plenty of these idiots in Australia too. 
t1_duser0s	1	*	Same reason people use offshore banks. Sometimes you dont want to be subject to your own countries laws.
t1_dudk7df	1	*	Any dissenting opinion counter to that of the echo chamber is labeled a russian bot.  
t1_duqv20a	0	*	Why even bother trying to make it look like an accident. It's Russia, what could possibly happen even if they admitted it?
t1_duwhewh	0	*	So his real name is Steven Goddard, he has a bachelor's in geology and a master's in electrical engineering.  With no doctorate.  Reading his blog you can clearly tell the man has an agenda.    I wish he showed the sea ice data over several decades instead of only 2008 then Jan 2018.  Show all of it.  Finally he has what can only be described as a punchable voice.  It has such a condescending tone to it.
t1_duh22d6	1	*	You mean Trump or Manafort?  Edit: spelling
t1_duymqoo	1	*	As Richard Ben-Veniste, of the Watergate special-prosecutor task force, put it: I would say this is High-Level Special Counsel Investigation 101. Mueller is operating by the book.
t1_duhj508	0	*	Actually we can pretty well explain how tide works 
t1_duq8fg7	1	*	Its okay because this will all backfire in their face eventually. This has damaged any sort of relationship we might of had and you know the US is going to go for revenge. We spend half their entire worth on war and all this means is funding will be shifted from physical to digital.  Between extremely heavy sanctions and our own cyber campaign Russia is going to be hurting. I'll be laughing the entire time.
t1_duflk0b	0	*	The thing with random accidents is you don't know when they occur.
t1_duahoek	1	*	> i would love to have heard the conversation between Bush and Putin after.   That short guy speaking broken English was hilarious, best stand up comedian I've seen this month

t1_duh2zt1	1	*	This world is on some ass backwards shit. I swear someone time traveled ... that bitch will slip through and Cobra Commander will serve 4 more years...sad
t1_duwn7k4	1	*	>The only other way would be getting security,   A food bank in Crivitz, Germany actually had police protection in 2016 because the situation was out of control.
t1_dusd6bq	1	*	It's getting monotonous, all of these bullshit claims. 
t1_dui51de	1	*	[And the blogger/cook book author they referred to who does it was livid they referenced her](https://cookingonabootstrap.com/2018/02/17/my-ready-meal-is-none-of-your-fucking-business/)
t1_dujq20v	1	*	You shouldnt take him literally.
t1_durs68p	1	*	Umm you're kind of lieing. It got up to 10c, not 14. And it's been averaging between -3 to 4c all week... not to mention that we have been  having really short and unseasonably warm winters for a decade now. But yeah. You've never seen it this warm.. ok 
t1_duac8s9	1	*	Yeah, leaving aside the whole 'Japan thinks'-I think we've got the opinion directly from the genius loci?-I doubt anyone in that country would be happy if they were in an 'Asian Union' that interfered with their affairs.
t1_duwbvpw	0	*	Whataboutery!!
t1_ducxnf4	1	*	If it were up to me I'd just double down on regulations when an industry player pulls this shit and I'd ensure 2nd-time white collar criminals were executed.  But I'm sure the broke brainwashed proletariat will tell me I'm wrong for suggesting this, despite living in a country where some of the rich make a fortune by unjustly incarcerating people for petty crimes for inordinate periods of time in facilities where their supposedly inalienable rights are routinely violated.
t1_dutgjiq	1	*	Luckily the 9 (not siblings) in my family have all survived. 
t1_duaqc6a	1	*	If anyone get caught with that then they will likely die by suicide the next week.
t1_duzlwdd	1	*	What ever gets you off man
t1_duhw2c9	1	*	Do you have to inform them if you have cancer?  There is an expectation that you are able to do your job in six months time and if you have cancer, that may not be the case.   Any employee you hire, male or female, may need to go on medical leave for a medical condition at any time. The company has policies in place to cover the medical absences of any employee at any time. There is no need to discuss possible (or known) future medical absences during the interview process. 
t1_dud69lj	1	*	Seriously in our last election we had Russians buying bird cages that could fit a fake Hiliary and Democrats dressed as Donald Duck. What a time to be alive
t1_duq4ljj	0	*	Hi Russia, how are you?
t1_duizof2	1	*	He already made the world more miserable

t1_duo3kjo	0	*	> The casting of a film or play should follow what the story calls for. In historical plays this it's even more important.  Jeanna D'arc had short, black hair and brown eyes. What if she was played by a white girl with brown hair and blue eyes  and it got this same amount of backlash? Would you agree with that too?
t1_duqht8i	1	*	Change your diet and start only swallowing one at a time. Simple easy fox news style burgers.

t1_duvf6mi	1	*	Or maybe humans are assholes for throwing their garbage on the floor or into the ocean instead of into a garbage
t1_duph5vg	0	*	I'm feeling nearly everything in this post. There's just one fly in the ointment.  > To all the gun toting, war mongering people: Please go back to school, learn a bit about history, compassion and ethics / morals. Feel free to discuss with me in an orderly fashion.  Try not to paint people who disagree with you as slack-jawed straw men. It only adds to the divisiveness of modern politics.  Just a friendly bit of advice, have a nice day!
t1_dujisio	1	*	If the voters didn't matter, he wouldn't bother with elections or election campaigns. Maybe what you think you know about Russia isn't entirely accurate.
t1_duc4l9u	1	*	The real punishment is China only gets to manufacture things where the outsourcing company doesn't care if Chinese sweatshops know how to make it, so the real high end stuff isn't getting made in china anymore.
t1_dusecyq	0	*	That was an idea that Trump proposed but I doubt it would work since most workers would try to use other means to send money

t1_duzblda	1	*	yes that is the same woman and the same guy as well. her nickname was Sasha back then and now it's Nastya.
t1_duwkrta	1	*	I am sure there will be some people who will find offense with this. These are times of kneejerk reactions, with little forethought, after all.
t1_dukla4j	1	*	Because they don't have any other major talking points beyond taxes and de-regulation. Like, the wall isn't going anywhere, they can't legitimately take credit for the country's economy in year 1, they can't even talk about giving people healthcare or taking it away.   It would be hilarious if I wasn't so fricken depressed over the ridiculous taxes i'm going to be paying in a decade and the extreme loss of soft power by the US.   
t1_dujwzqy	1	*	It's Reddit.  You have Europeans calling Americans dumb fucks on one hand, and Americans calling Europeans dumb fucks on the other.  Nothing new here.
t1_due4lud	1	*	Yeah, I mean if you ignore all the facts before you I guess you could type out a statement like that.   Other than all the evidence they have, they have nothing, right?
t1_duv7rl0	1	*	Everyone is already doing that with plastic. Hence things like this: https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asiapacific/taiwan-to-ban-plastic-straws-cups-by-2030-9981998  https://www.theguardian.com/business/2018/jan/15/iceland-vows-to-eliminate-plastic-on-all-own-branded-products  It's a start. But yeah, overfishing is another big issue.
t1_dumpvyf	1	*	I mean... yeah, it is a myth (nowhere near 'all of us'), but also history is a lot longer than you think it is, I guess. This article is talking about stuff that happened 4,500 years ago. Genghis Khan was only like 800 years ago.

t1_duboew6	0	*	I got accused of being a Russian bot on Twitter because I said it's possible to buy a car in the United States for $3,600, which was apparently evidence of me screwing up a ruble-USD conversion. The #resistance people had no goddamn *clue* that most of the country drives used cars and most of those cars cost below $10,000.   
t1_duj8avh	1	*	Funny as it is, it's not for Putin.  It basically says Vote or you will have to live in a country with president that doesn't represent your opinion.  Which, in all honesty, is a good message. Especially when the voters' apathy is so high.  I guess Putin line just suits this media outlet better.
t1_duyns59	0	*	Trump is a goddamn Russian cell. 
t1_durwxay	1	*	He's a fucking red tie blow hard. Basically sucking trump and the rest of the rights dick and then afterwards acting like this. Two-faced politicians who lie to the public to look good.

However it is a cycle worth breaking for everyone involved and people are capable of breaking it. After all 100% of ethnic groups have been violently repressed at some point but not all are currently engaged in violent tit for tats. Anywhere in the world where two neighboring ethnic groups are NOT at each other's throats someone in their history was able to make the cycle stop.
t1_durtrta	1	*	yup
t1_dukkj92	1	*	It's a shit conclusion to say that Facebook got a bigger ad payment after the election means they didn't try to impact the election. You can only say Russia didn't use Facebook ads to impact the election.

t1_durj5gw	0	*	Japanese medicine actually is lower dosage than what you get in the US and they have a lot of holes in what you can buy over the counter since they are extremely nervous about mis-usage (cold medicine has a chemical in it you need for meth, for example)

t1_duz86xy	0	*	But those are not inevitable requirements in order to have advanced infrastructure. Japan and many European countries also have great infrastructure, way better than he US. What's your excuse for those?  The truth is that there is no excuse. You're country is just run by idiots voted in by idiots. I say that as someone who loves the ideals America claims to represent and wishes your country could fix its issues. I'd much rather have you guys as hegemon than China or Russia

t1_dulj3xv	1	*	I don't know much about him but a lot of people who are bad (as the comments here seem to mostly indicate) can do good.  That Westboro Baptist founder was like the most accomplished Civil Right's attorney in Kansas during the Civil Rights Movement.  He clearly believed very strongly in the issue, and yet he is going to be remembered forever as someone who hates everyone and for making loads of money off of lawsuits against angry people.

The only thing that is weird is that there are people that still use this statement as an argument. It is an obvious non-argument, a favorite of Israeli hasbara and others who can't defend an indefensible state of affairs in the OPT.

Ive taken six fights in the past few weeks (including 2 yesterday), and all I can think about when Im up in the air are the countless reddit threads Ive read where pilots describe the close calls, near collisions, and malfunctions that have happened on their planes as well as news stories like this.

t1_duhe7lr	1	*	This is bullshit re: the paramedics. Where are you getting your info? Who would even support such a law and how would it be practical or enforceable ? You think all Saudi men care so little about their female family members that they would support a law that would mean their wives, sisters and daughters would  be left to die on the street in an accident if they weren't present?

t1_ducbdx3	0	*	It's even more sad that you made it out that it's a liberal issue and not a human one. People like you are the problem.  Too busy blaming something else without looking at yourself.

t1_duguynx	0	*	You ever tried telling somebody too dumb to know how dumb they are what to do?
t1_duti5en	1	*	A lot of famous anti-vaxers are not religious. 
t1_dujtcwc	1	*	~25%. Trump will never ever get that low as about 35% of the US will never stop supporting him no matter what. If you want things to change, do everything you can to help flip the House in November. Donate, phone-bank, volunteer on a campaign. 
t1_duivof9	0	*	For now, Merkel just nominated Kramp-Karrenbauer for the role of CDU's secretary general, but K-K still needs to be elected at the next party convention (or, for the lack of another candidate, confirmed). That's all that actually happened, however this sends a clear signal as to who Merkel (and probably the rest of the CDU leadership) wants to succeed her as the party's leader and prime candidate going into the next federal election.    
t1_dunat1q	1	*	They live off the fat of the landline.
t1_dubovvx	1	*	You hit it on the head, it's about division and radicalization.
t1_dumii6h	1	*	Change indeed. Orthodox jews breed like rabbits. The reason they need Lebensraum to begin with. If only they were a bit more eager to serve and work.
t1_duxyri8	0	*	Putin will teach you to love the motherland.
t1_duf5jew	1	*	I feel like it's usually way worse than this. It's kind of an inarguable truth.
t1_dus23yk	1	*	Not at all. Are you embarrassed by Trump in general?
t1_dua7n77	1	*	If an active shooter walked into your small store with intent to kill while either of those two open-carry people were there, you can't tell me that you wouldn't be glad that for the presence of the open-carry person.  
t1_dujyqkn	1	*	Isn't that what like... Every politician does to some extent?
t1_dutgzbz	1	*	Yeah looks accidental to me
t1_duf9fyh	1	*	Not sure about all that. The divide between Democrat and Republican seems much sharper and noticeable in the zeitgeist. 
t1_due7b4c	1	*	Oh dear, you forgot your gloves again, and you know how the sidewalks tear up your poor knuckles...
t1_dusuksy	1	*	FTFY  Jesus, POTUS is so stupid. 
t1_duc77b7	1	*	Why, if you join the army then planting trees for political points is not why you joined. How would you feel if your job was restructured into something completely different that you didn't want to do?
t1_duagahj	1	*	In addition to the fact that the UK-made weapons were exported to KSA in the 80's. UK has signed and ratified the CCM, in case people were wondering.  I've seen people previously claim these are things the UK is currently making and selling; they are not. 
t1_dut0271	0	*	I was already starting to get scared when I heard there is no merino wool available in the world because China bought it all to make new military uniforms. 
t1_duppwru	1	*	>Russian athlete caught doping  Two questions: What were they taking, and how can I get some?
t1_dulbo08	1	*	Trump is a brand. This forest is free advertising for him.

t1_dut0th5	1	*	Wait if you like Reagan why wouldnt you like trump? Policy wise theres no logical reason for that. 
t1_dummq9n	0	*	Apparently he never saw what happened in the last scene in Django Unchained

t1_dudwjci	1	*	>as long as Planet Earth has an interconnected global computer network  So say we all
t1_dugb2jz	1	*	Yeah, but what if you majored in political science?  Then, you'd probably get paid enough to fund a STEM major the next time around.
t1_ducpad4	0	*	How many of them are currently in the US? 
t1_dupq0ty	1	*	Because no real wealth has been created with the central bankers. It very to easy to mislead people in a planned market 
t1_dutbcgc	1	*	Hopefully selection event, where some resistant to the climatic changes survive and pass on their resistance, and numbers can rebound. But a population collapse due to climate change can easily become an extinction event if there are other pressures as well (and most animals are under other pressures).
t1_dup840w	1	*	> * Blatant admission that Russian mercenaries in Syria are fighting on behalf of Putin's government.  Soldiers crying about Russian government abandoning them proves this.
t1_duppdd1	1	*	This image is only found here, and I could not supporting data, though all the reports were written like propaganda.
t1_dup4pwf	1	*	You might want to try actually reading the article.
t1_duhcirz	1	*	Ice cores would be my guess.
t1_duzgd0c	1	*	A year later: Taxation is theft!  I see the value of private property and all, and pretty sure South Africa leadership is rotten. But i also *obviously* wealth accumulation can be a big problem, and wage slavery is regular slavery. I wouldn't say any such in absolute.
t1_duth34y	0	*	> terrorist own goal  i shouldn't be laughing in this thread
t1_dudopb6	1	*	It's not a milestone for the planet, but certainly for our record keeping. 
t1_dupjyzb	0	*	What a day... taking measures against possible elections fraud = setting up to do election fraud. And it's light at night and dark in the day.
t1_duyo1do	0	*	Its a PR campaign to save the tattered image of the FBI.   I thought exactly the same as you that there was an episode of Oprah in the 80s where Trump admitted he thought of running for POTUS.  Did Oprah put Trump up to this?! Was Oprah a Cold War era Soviet agent?! Mueller to investigate! More at 11! /s 
t1_duoe4n5	0	*	Yeah, title seemed super apocalyptic at first until I realised that
t1_dubu0sr	0	*	> they really ruined the image of those who try to oppose the regime seriously.  Wut? They shined a light on an issue that the world didn't know about until they made a stink.
t1_duc8yyi	1	*	exactly matuzee  Nobody wants to pay for the externalities
t1_duga38n	1	*	If you think 20% more bananas are bad then you might not wanna look into how sugar is priced in the US and compare to the rest of the world.   And you may not want to look at t the fact that the US Gov't funds Florida's everglade restoration projects while simultaneously giving benefits to the Domino Sugar corporation whose operations pollute the Florida everglades. 
t1_dus717i	1	*	The ... in this case is an abbreviation of a quote, not a dramatic pause. That may be confusing you. 
t1_duebfd9	1	*	> read: Mild earthquake reignites British hysteria.   What doesnt?
t1_dudn7ke	1	*	**FUCK PALM OIL**
t1_duugqy3	1	*	Need the evidence for when the DHS comes knocking and questioning your marriage. 
t1_duri7ko	1	*	Karma is a bitch.
t1_dugcmdc	1	*	Most plausible explanation to me. I'll go with that. 
t1_dur3t10	1	*	 Sounds more like a poor translation/Russian version. If I remember correctly Russian units are quite a bit smaller than US equivalents.
t1_duxvydm	0	*	They're fucking worse than africans burning albinos and witches so I'd wager they'd kill all the women that dissented until it's too late, like china until 1950. Just like the usa would nuke it's own population to death if we where mind controlled to attack the white house. The people in power would rather be the last person alive than lose for any reason ever. 
t1_duplbmm	1	*	The official statement atm is he got shot that caused him to die and had bruises.  EDIT: I am now reading what I wrote (while sober) after I had some drinks, how did I manage to fuck up so bad? 
t1_duhudu3	1	*	Beta blockers? Calming agents? 
t1_duw8x9n	1	*	Yeah it's just like I thought.   ISOBEL Thompson's article history is more indicitive of a biased redditor with too much free time than it is a journalist.
t1_dutckt4	1	*	What punishment? They won fair and square. Whatever flag the organizers decide to slap on their jerseys, whatever songs they decide to play, everyone knows who the players are and which country they play for.  I don't see how they bear the punishment, because not only did they win an Olympic gold medal, they did so while thumbing their nose at everyone who tried to ban Russia from the Olympics.
t1_dut0hku	1	*	Yes.
t1_dur51rj	0	*	Uhh do you realise that Russia is banned from competing at the Winter Olympics? What stronger measures do you want them to take?
t1_duqggjw	0	*	Is the US a monarchy now?  Ivanka is not a diplomat with the State Department. She doesn't even have an offical role in the White House.  Trump supporters lost their shit over 'political dynasties' with Bill and Hillary. Why is it suddenly OK for Trump to give his daughter and son-in-law the power to make international policy with no accountability?  It just doesn't make logical sense.
t1_dupzf3j	1	*	Technically yes.  But most of the time that just means sanctions, expelling diplomats, trade penalties, etc.  Unfortunately.   
t1_duf3szs	1	*	How droll. 
t1_duq3ou4	0	*	we could also allow schools to fire teachers which may have allowed the school to address its bullying problem which may have prevented this. we could try investigating people who say they want to be professional school shooters too. 
t1_duj2yka	0	*	Like the liberal media
t1_duxyf0q	1	*	Hopefully the ones that are doing this to the Palestinians can find a hell to live in?
t1_duhf08e	1	*	> They would lose a nuclear exchange with America or Russia.  No one would really win those.
t1_dushfvy	1	*	Because so few people read the article past the headline sometimes it pays to to dispel knee-jerk reactions in the headline.
t1_dubsj9q	1	*	These animals are also very intelligent and human-like, which makes this even worse. 
t1_duxpe8l	0	*	It's not a religious expression. This is emancipation from group think.
t1_duvpl5a	1	*	That's obvious. They'll say the figures are wrong. It doesn't matter if all that's left of the Arctic is just a single piece of ice that a shitload of polar bears are clinging to.
t1_dubg2bt	1	*	I thought it was the other way around.
t1_dudlksp	1	*	I sort of feel ripped off because I don't feel anything from coffee. I still drink it because it taste good 
t1_dubs188	1	*	Uhhh, never?
t1_due95iv	0	*	Why upstage Elon when you can share technologies and work with him? That would be a killer team.
t1_dun2y2g	0	*	If you didn't know, they cancelled the whole Trump joke, instead of carrying it on to other seasons like they usually do, because they thought they were drawing beautiful satire, and satire is no longer funny to them when it becomes reality, so they chose a new direction.
t1_dubu93g	1	*	> Brazilian drug lord  > time  pick one of these things
t1_duqhmdi	1	*	Why would I read the article when I could attack the article based on how I feel about the subject?  > In addition to the 12% who say they have been raped, 58% have been subjected to disturbing propositions and 43% to sexual touching without consent, the study says.  
t1_due2xum	1	*	Thank you! I know language drifts over time, but it really bothers me that we are losing the nuance between jealousy and envy. 
t1_due110f	1	*	twitter is a whore who will do whatever you want for the right amount. Anyone calling them or their favorites out gets shut down.  
t1_dutzulo	1	*	Well yes, but that's not the reason measles has 21,000 cases.
t1_duhh2sp	1	*	The images of the kids in the village, looking at that ash cloud, that's terrifying.
t1_duqzksm	0	*	Because of the fact that some kids are too young or too sick to be vaccinated: they're susceptible to the disease , and will be infected because someone who could have vaccinated didn't. Unfortunately i don't remember the scientific term for this so i'd suggest doing some research, just in case my answer is inaccurate.
t1_duc7r90	0	*	Oh, it is ok because his gang didn't rape these particular people... /s
t1_dumj9os	1	*	I would say any Indian source reporting on anything relating to China is unreliable 100% of the time 
t1_duldlhm	1	*	I think the state is alot less powerful in india. There is just too much chaos, too much history, too much tradition. People are guided by their tribes or local culture, they barely come in contact with the state compared to the west.  So, it's not respect they are lacking. They have no reason to respect a highly corrupt state.
t1_duwkky8	1	*	Well you don't pay of government officials with millions/billions of lobby money. Also viel Spaxdf mit deinem Diesel. Frechheit das ganze Thema 
t1_dufkdlw	1	*	lol
t1_dussf27	1	*	Well we know Trump would love it!
t1_duwargw	1	*	It's a legitimate issue for the human race now, millions are already migrating because of it, and whole ecosystem like coral reef are already facing an existential threat. Don't extend your worry about this too far into the future, it's here now, and we have to change our ways as soon as possible.
t1_duynujn	1	*	I don't know if the Russians used tax-payer money to buy the American election. It could have been a waste of Oligarch $$$$

t1_duaerj1	1	*	Most insurance companies figured that out already, I haven't seen it covered in years.
t1_duu1yfe	0	*	A very small part of me is holding onto the hope that Trump ran for president just to publicly show how broken our system is and how divided the American people are. I know it's not true, but I can dream.
t1_dug6t4l	1	*	I guess that depends on Mexican laws.
t1_durjjxy	1	*	You mean like the fact that the headline / article is two years old and one of the guys is in jail? (the others were minors)
t1_dunfika	1	*	Considering it works on who's least corrupt, America would be lower on the list. 
t1_duhsyfo	1	*	No, it should read someone makes misinformed comment on reddit based solely on a headline - again
t1_duzefn3	1	*	What a dumb fucking comment. Their lives are in danger because they are going against Russia...ok is this unique only to Russia? I'm sure snowdens life was also In danger. Reddit is full of idiotic comments. 
t1_duxdrae	1	*	Seriously the hypocrisy is amazing. I wonder how many people in Yemen have been killed by American bombs.
t1_dudv6s4	0	*	That's all she knows.
t1_duodzr7	1	*	Spotlight (2016) explains it well.
t1_duhq14j	1	*	Oh we had a Witchfinder General over in the UK!    https://youtu.be/98gzk6VSzfU They also made a film with Vincent Price about it, I love it!
t1_dufxsc3	1	*	It depends on how you time jumping up before impact. 
t1_duhjljx	0	*	You call bullshit because you personally dont understand something?
t1_dui1nlp	1	*	Considering boomers and gen x constructed and protects the rules and regulations these companies are using to harm the general public,   I'd say it degraded within their generations since they're still the ones who are politically in charge.
t1_dusvbuy	1	*	You have to try and understand the angst of the rural white folks and why they dislike Mexicans.   -some Trump apologist/the I'm gonna play devil's advocate here guy/t_d moron
t1_duds08j	0	*	Do you not get healthcare through your employment? Or was that with it?
t1_duq86c3	1	*	I've seen this exact comment multiple times before. It's a copy pasta. Can anyone verify?

t1_duaatv5	1	*	He ded
t1_duh2qw1	0	*	Hed be a lot more hilarious if he wasnt president. Clueless rich person tweeting threats to foreign countries=funny President of the US tweeting threats to foreign countries=dangerous. I find that the majority of people who love his tweets are children.
t1_durychf	1	*	  Well if you could identify the good guys you could try something like the international brigades in the spanish civil war.  But the last to do something like this were the cubans helping out African recolutions.
t1_dutkh3g	1	*	But I didn't get autism! (it hurts that I even have to do this.../s)
t1_dupsvf2	1	*	It's an international story given the crimes alleged are international in origin, nevermind the fact that it is also linked to the investigation of Russian interference into American elections which is also an international story.
t1_duf7sx1	1	*	Took long enough to find a Hitler comparison. 
t1_dupbonh	1	*	I do side with the antifascists because, contrary to the liberal bullshit up and down this comments section, violence undertaken through the state as a politician is just as serious as violence directly applied to individuals. It should also be noted that this guy's party has been linked to very similar direct violence in the past. This may be distasteful to the polite debate pedants of reddit, but The Discourse won't solve every problem. 
t1_duhurpj	1	*	If thats what happened, why not say something right away? Go get tested before competition  no one does that  it might give the point some credibility. Maybe it would have hurt his chances to compete, but he wouldnt have taken everyone else down with him.  (I dont think Russia should be competing anyway, but... :: awaits troll downvotes ::)
t1_dursqb7	1	*	Oh look another person who doesnt understand what freedom of speech means. 
t1_dummbkr	1	*	You think you made a difference? Lol
t1_dut0bxq	1	*	He finds it convenient to hide behind the pretext that he's not a dictator. 
t1_dulk8iw	0	*	because generally speaking, reddit hates alcohol and so studies that conform to its general worldview get constantly upvoted. 
t1_duc3qf9	1	*	We do it's called the Army Corps of Engineers. 
t1_dugwbfl	1	*	Everything I don't like is hate speech! RRREEEEEEE
t1_duqpj3l	1	*	Nope, you plead guilty, then help the case and squeal so you don't go to jail for it.  Squeal everything because these are some serious charges.
t1_duhiu60	1	*	I wonder how many nannies he took? Yep just looks like a family vacation. Taxpayers dollars hard at work.
t1_duktsvk	1	*	> Guess the volcanos under the water making the water warmer  Was also happening hundreds of years ago,  yet the rapid rise in sea temps happened much more recently. A better explanation than volcanos is needed to account for the difference. 
t1_dujvp4l	1	*	It will end when the US public tell their representatives to impeach him and remove him from office. He is only in power because the Americans allow him to be.
t1_ducb0c4	1	*	Yep, and they're upvoted. What could go wrong with vigilante justice?
t1_dugxh9l	0	*	This is being told to other world leaders. I think the real message is you other world leaders, please pay no attention to the petty Twitter lies*  those are targeted at the internal market.  (* Note: it was admitted at least a couple of times by White House officials that what had been tweeted was patently false, and yet, had served its purpose.)
t1_duhpwep	1	*	Dont forget the sunny beaches and cool new fossils!
t1_dufd8oq	0	*	Of course he wasnt. He was fucked over by someone he trusted. As per usual with shitty The Sun exposxe9 stories like these. 
t1_dud7fi7	1	*	5,000,000/ 400ppl /365 =  34 pills roughly In 2 years = 17 pills roughly?
t1_duux7cg	1	*	Seems like hes taken a shine to the method for sure.
t1_dujn4ug	1	*	Gaslighter-in-chief. 
t1_durfqfx	1	*	I wonder how much of that is contributed by the Diesel economy, which almost all major European car makers that designs and builds diesel cars to comply with the euro car standards actually does not?   Read Volkswagen defeat devices for this. Turns out all of the EU car makers perform the same trick.
t1_dudo8ff	1	*	*elitist
t1_duzl8xp	1	*	This isn't about being left or right leaning. Both sides don't like corruption, this Russian escort apparently has proof of said corruption. Let the lady speak.
t1_dubqzam	1	*	Let me guess your subs.... kek
t1_dulk0r3	1	*	Should have been gassed.
t1_dul36nj	1	*	The west actually doesn't give a fuck about Iran. Look at the nuclear deal that has gave Iran the power the threat the existence of Saudi and Israel
t1_dunzacb	1	*	I agree completely. Along these lines, Trump isn't the problem, he's the result of the problem.
t1_duu8vui	1	*	, !
t1_dusja74	1	*	I dont know.  Idiocracy is looking more like a documentary 
t1_dud5xs7	0	*	Jesus we (remain) lost because of lies said to the general public who are too ignorant to research the facts and now we're going to get dragged kicking and screaming out of the EU because some of the leave campaign has smelt the bullshit and realised how bad of an idea this is.  The reality is this is May's last taste of power and mark my words will force this through and ruin my country rather than set up another referendum to be certain if this is even what the British public wants anymore.
t1_duyjggv	1	*	He had no memory of it. Typical Japanese avoidance tactics. The usual excuse for crimes is I dont remember because I was drunk at the time, and it works!
t1_duj6a48	1	*	Honestly this is progressives for Russia. They're usually 30-50 years behind the West on most social issues. They're only about a decade or less on this one.
t1_dud4sc3	0	*	> Couldn't stand to see that crook win the election!  But you did see him win the election.
t1_dupas30	1	*	They were invited to come in. That makes it OK. 
t1_duhnzyg	1	*	Russia more than China. Unlike Russia, China is extremely dependant on the survival of the global economy. Russia is already choking themselves out economically.   Anyway, if the world is drowning, whose gonna buy more oil?
t1_dur4wni	1	*	Just the tip
t1_dulucsp	1	*	That wouldn't be in your best interest either 
t1_dull39j	1	*	Germany profited from the war in the Middle East by selling weapons. Germany is one of the top weapon producers in the world.
t1_dupgfnu	0	*	And I thought my families taxes supported that Surplus, silly me
t1_duqz4us	1	*	Japanese? Where did that come from?
t1_dudx10c	1	*	The articles reads that they have lower sales as doctors prescripe two separate active ingredients which are way cheaper.  But if you want them combined, there is just this one. 
t1_duszzkg	1	*	It's about time you guys go for round 2. 
t1_ducplsq	1	*	I think it's a good step regardless. Enforcing US election interference law. Heck yeah!
t1_duq5kvb	1	*	One important thing. This is superseding, its most likely result of plea deal.
t1_duyn7t9	1	*	I think you have brain cancer
t1_duyxvxo	1	*	Embedded by NPR did an amazing episode on this 
t1_duowcga	1	*	But it's not natural.
t1_duyiyuo	1	*	All I am sure of is the [emcee](https://g.co/kgs/53MPHU) went into semi-early-retirement a little over a year ago. Wouldnt be surprised if the gay guy in the room has the most dirt. 
t1_duoie5s	0	*	I think this is Mueller saying I've got everything I need and you have nothing new to offer. It's too late for you to flip.
t1_dugh3cf	0	*	Not to mention the huge subsidies farmers were getting from the EU because the UK failed to give them it.
t1_duycajf	1	*	We can slow deforestation with hemp production in marginally productive farmland.
t1_duei4us	1	*	anyone who volunteers to dress like that must not know what a joke is
t1_duhn879	0	*	You are correct that melting sea ice does not contribute to sea level rise. However, ice reflects sunlight, whereas water absorbs it, and the temperature of the ocean is a contributing factor to the sea level, since warmer water occupies more space. The other contributing factor is melting ice on land, which becomes much more likely when the sea ice surrounding it is gone.  
t1_dudumx3	1	*	Yeah, and next time you're getting carjacked, just pick up the car and knock him over!
t1_duufdcc	1	*	That is some enders game level stuff there. 
t1_duwkjfe	0	*	Diesel vehicles have always been a major source of pollution. Their primary advantage was in fuel efficiency. Diesel never really caught on in the US for consumer vehicles because of tighter pollution controls and lower taxes on gasoline.
t1_dul9znd	1	*	Thanks, Trump just doesn't have the same ring to it as Thanks, Obama.
t1_duynaau	1	*	Delet this 
t1_dun7cjy	1	*	Quite possibly. I recall from the last major incident that they locked them all inside and set fire to the school, burning them alive.  At the same time though they have also kidnapped 10,000 boys and and training them (some as young as 5) to be child soldiers. [Source](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-kidnapped-boys-of-boko-haram-1471013062)

t1_duso2yb	1	*	Jo.
t1_dujj2jg	0	*	You sound like that kind of person that would be very welcome in Canada or Europe maybe. Just come over, we'll grant you political asylum.
t1_dueu67p	1	*	Just your daily reminder that /r/worldnews and especially /r/news are regularly targeted by the same Russian propaganda machine. 
t1_dug5kig	1	*	Or the freedom to choose *your own* religion instead of having it forced on you at birth?  Religious freedom indeed.  Circumcision at birth is the *literally the exact opposite* of religious freedom.
t1_duq023f	1	*	Either that or find some way to split it in three, which seems a lot more far-fetched.
t1_duu3mfm	1	*	Probably tied for the best with France and Poland.

t1_durcan0	1	*	Same area. We had a foot and a half of snow one day, and the next day with temperatures soaring and rain falling it all turned to water within an afternoon. I was wading through a foot of slushwater over my entire lawn trying to get it to drain before my basement flooded. Did I mention I live on pure sand and have never seen a flood here in my life?
t1_duq0xcp	1	*	Are you a politician?
t1_dujhywv	0	*	You do realize that those who were part of and or responsible for what happened in the Second World War are all dead right?  That the people in charge of the nation and those who inhabit it are completely different, right?  Trotting out this stupid semi-serious joke is old, tired and doesn't reflect on the current Geo-political situation.
t1_duwwp78	1	*	>No, you're wrong there- quite wrong there. The bank is something else than men. It happens that every man in a bank hates what the bank does, and yet the bank does it. The bank is something more than men, I tell you. It's the monster. Men made it, but they can't control it. 
t1_dui1k4c	0	*	>reduced university places             You are aware more people are going to uni than ever before?
t1_duqjf87	1	*	In the comments above someone quoted the definition in French, it roughly translates to 'an act of sexual penetration involving violence, constraint or suprise'.
t1_dusyajv	1	*	Read Wages of Destruction and Nazi Germany utter failure with the Volkswagen plan. 
t1_dujzwh8	1	*	Lmao for starters don't tally your lies from the mouth of paid interests, aka, Politifact. Obama and DOJ friends are on course for far more lies and corruption than the already insanely vetted Trump could dream. Go outside the echo chamber occasionally. 
t1_dumtjta	0	*	Yes, because giving a teacher something to defend themselves AND their students turns a school into battleground. It's almost like gun free zones lure shooters or something...
t1_duaa6xl	1	*	Which is a really poor analogy, if you think about it. A group of countries with a mutually agreed on set of rules for exports and the flow of human resources is a lot different than XXX country is making the rules for YYY!!1!. But I guess its not as catchy a sound bite. 
t1_dudieqq	1	*	Why sad? Is that not true?
t1_dug2qpk	1	*	It's the job of the US to try and talk some basic sense into their man-child president they elected tbf. They chose him, after all. Other countries naturally want to look out for themselves (in this case, caring more about a trade deal than trying to save the US from itself). 
t1_dugyc61	1	*	NAFTA muddies this whole thing. Many companies funnel metal/products through Mexico now to circumvent our protection.
t1_durhuev	1	*	Good thing nothing is up to you, and hopefully never will be.  There are few things more poisonous than someone with a vengeful, punitive attitude.  inb4 straw man, ad hominem or false dichotomy

t1_duotizo	0	*	Wow. One drug lord could potentially give 1000 families $50k and change a community if he felt like it. 
t1_dulidko	1	*	As everyone can see from the replies: we're fucked. 
t1_dujbkn5	1	*	Youd absolutely be hearing about it, because the Russian PsyOps would be pushing the Rigged Election narrative that they primed beforehand - in fact, I bet they were planning on that being the case and had to adjust when Trump pulled off an unlikely victory. 
t1_duc5g7p	0	*	No, they don't like people knowing about their human rights abuses. It makes them look like hypocrites, and that's not nice.
t1_ducnl24	1	*	He's proud of his action, so what?
t1_dux467a	0	*	>Why do the Chinese allow themselves to be so easily and blatantly censored?   When your income quadrupled in 10 years, you tend to be okay with less political freedom
t1_duchn5f	1	*	Both can be true, which is the only point that matters in all this.  Americans love to rant about guns, a divisive topic. It's in Putin's interest for Americans to become further divided, so why not use a topic that is already actively dividing the public?  Cheaper than making a new one.   Edit: sp

t1_dunfywq	1	*	That's the beauty of changes like this. The single use plastic straw industry dies out....the metal or reusable straw industry takes off...along with all of the peripheral industries like straw washing machines, cleaning fluids, new dispensers etc. 
t1_dueoo84	0	*	There's people that think Russia never invaded Ukraine and Crimea spontaneously joined Russia all on it's own. If you bring up all the troops that appeared you'll be told it didn't happen. If you post the proof that Putin admitted it happened suddenly the story changes and it was good they were there.

t1_duwhga8	1	*	While I do understand your concerns, here's a British precedent: http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-kent-41915889
t1_duh0zrp	1	*	I voted Hillary reluctantly
t1_duiahil	0	*	The most patriotic thing you can do is pay taxes.    Why are people so dead set against making the very country that allowed them to become so incredibly well off better.   Heck, even Warren Buffet has repeatedly stated that the government is stupid and that he should be paying a HUGE portion of his income as tax (corporations as well).
t1_dugtgk0	1	*	> America is a joke ~~at the moment.~~  and it has been for decades. Our two-party system is a sham and only serves to divide the nation. It's a disgrace. No wonder it was so easy for the Russians to drive the wedge deeper during the last election. The current system needs a massive overhaul but I doubt I'll see it in my lifetime. 
t1_dutelhs	1	*	The price tag just goes up and gets passed along to their customers. You see the same thing with drug cartels. The more your clamp down, especially by force, the more the poachers will arm themselves and expand their troupe size. The more dangerous their arsenals will become. The more leverage over legislators they will seek. We should go after customers pocketbooks instead. We shouldnt fine them. We should arrest them and reallocate all of their assets to conservation efforts. 
t1_duyosci	1	*	Sergei! You were told remember?  You have to pick names that sound American!
t1_dur0x4n	1	*	If you read the article, you'll see that they repaid the loan, *because* the money had been spent on combating polio. They didn't just give Nigeria money, hoping it would be well spent. It seems it was done that way on purpose.

t1_due200n	1	*	Socialised health care would stop the price gouging, When everyone is paying into the system at all times not just when they are sick they want to know that the money they could have kept is at the very least going to something productive and helpful not to pay for $3K painkillers. 
t1_dutkjwf	1	*	Prayer doesn't happen overnight, sheesh. Sometimes it takes years! The lordt can't keep up with these diseases. 
t1_duq91q1	1	*	Be gone Russian shill!  Americans supporting gun rights is a myth!  Russians control everything!  /s  What if I told you Russians play the extremes at both ends in order to create exactly the kind of political rift in this comment section?  And it's working very well.
t1_duq7lc6	1	*	You can't architecture decades of increasingly negative/polarized political climate though, only leverage it.  84 was morning in America, 88 was Willie Horton and we've just gone from there.

t1_duq9e1z	1	*	What? r/news is about as left leaning as anything else on this site. I feel like the people who say this shit are so far left that even moderate leftists make them feel like they're living in a alt right conservative wonderland.   Any sub besides maybe /cringeanarchy or /thedonalad are all left leaning (at least those are the disaster zones I know about).   It really is befuddling to me.

t1_duo4xrb	1	*	Saudi people are conservative. They like the face veil, segregation etc  Its not hard to imagine thered by people like that. If you look at some places in Europe they can be extremely lefty liberal because of the culture there. Saudi is just extremely conservative because of the culture there
t1_dua8zf0	0	*	Well, it's hard to call that one person's mistake...
t1_dusns8u	1	*	It really depends, and its unfortunate that so many older people are isolated on their own. My mom and aunts retired and live pretty close together. Only a couple are still driving, but they live in a close community. There's always someone to get to the store or the doctor, people look after each other. Being able to give up driving and depend on others is, in a way, more like it was back before everyone had cars.

t1_dua0p0i	1	*	She did get a $200k a year job out of him. And think of her pay out in the future when she takes him to the cleaners.
t1_duqyn2i	1	*	Needs to be said: Much of this stems from Mitch McConnell's lawsuit against the FEC in 2000; which led to the Citizens United decision in 2010 finally overturning McCain-Feingold, (which was a desperate last-gasp stopgap attempt to save democracy).  McCain's thumbs down last November was a big FUCK YOU to McConnell, and everything he stands for: eroding our democratic processes and traditions. For money. 
t1_dua0f3d	1	*	We don't blame the vans that terrorists drive over British and French civilians..
t1_dud1vrr	1	*	The virgin form of the oil is quite nice. The stuff you actually get most of the time might as well be generic vegetable oil. I don't understand why they even use it if they're just going to roast it to shit.
t1_dun7b91	1	*	Probably not, Italy is much more corrupt. Or maybe not more corrupt but there is much more impunity. More apathy from citizens as well. The fact that a Berlusconi is not in jail is mind boggling enough, but when you realize he could very well become PM again you just had the best case against democracy presented to you.
t1_duuibhl	1	*	Nope, it's just a report of a record highest temperature there for this day of the year.

t1_dup4ncw	1	*	Dude, that can't be real. :D  Have an upvote
t1_ducts4r	0	*	Nothing from this shows Trump working with the Russians. They certainly played a roll but I don't think Trump was involved it's been over a year.

t1_durf5ja	1	*	Thank you. 
t1_duxvd32	1	*	They'll always have Lebanese food.
t1_duo6fqi	0	*	It's not misleading. That completely new mission statement has omitted the idea of being a nation that encourages immigration to one that focuses on defending itself from immigrants. I would say the removal of that statement is very meaningful and says a lot about the change as a whole. 
t1_dujd96n	1	*	Lol fuck that. Are you really suggesting that the USA extradites its own citizen for committing a crime within its own borders to a foreign country (that has a poor human rights record as well, though that shouldn't even matter).  Next time a criminal robs an Lenovo laptop from a best buy in New York should they be extradited to China as well? 
t1_duqvwp5	1	*	> his senior campaign adviser is being charged with conspiracy against the United States  This isn't exactly what you think it is. Conspiracy against the United States just means that you were out to defraud the government, usually for tax evasion.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_against_the_United_States
t1_duwigv5	1	*	Fak
t1_duxuxxj	0	*	That does remind one of certain perspectives in the United States. Are they anticipating losing the election and already setting things up to make anyone who manages to defeat Trudeau illegitimate?
t1_dumblg9	1	*	That's what all the exploitative pedos tell themselves! 
t1_dus5xur	0	*	I'm surprised you're not boosting Russia more, going by your posting history.
t1_duotfis	1	*	I don't think you expect a real answer, but it's because you're on Reddit too much.
t1_duejpbd	1	*	Only because we want you to. Ireland would still be a wasteland if EU did not allow it in the single market to cash in tax at the expense of the other player. The USA can't pull a move like that.
t1_dukk1p8	0	*	I think you hit on the key.  The Don sold his brand as a synonym for sophistication, success, and wealth.  Once Trump becomes a synonym for doing something stupid or failing at something, then maaayyybe the Don will either STFU or at least try to think before saying or tweeting something. Naw... not even then.
t1_duh6n1v	0	*	You're the banner boy for how terribly the american education system has failed its students
t1_dummyhy	0	*	That's America. Keep them dumb and you can get all the votes for tax plans that fuck them over.  It's sinking in that I'm not proud to live here. I do love my state, which may as well be a foreign country to the rest of the US at this point.
t1_dujluf0	1	*	If it was sparring/exercise it makes tons of sense though. Don't want your soldiers harming themselves during training.

t1_duhseph	0	*	Of course it takes some effort, but its one of those events that relies significantly more on skill and teamwork than physical prowess. Any of the competitors is capable of sending the stones right past the mark, so being the strongest or most athletic competitor isnt particularly helpful, especially when youre running the risk of being banned outright for basically no advantage.
t1_dul5xnw	1	*	If only it was actually that. The currently used books are more Catholics, Christianity, Judaism, Islam, then everything else squeezed in.

t1_dull3xp	1	*	Get on it reddit 
t1_dud95wa	1	*	Not really. They pushed Bernie and Trump and so far has shown no direct connection that appears intentional for either campaign. They started this effort before Candidates had even announced.

t1_dua5hne	1	*	Got any hard data to back up your statistics claim?
t1_duj3mkv	1	*	This from the world leader that cant stop posing for pictures dressed like a dude at a San Francisco gay dance club.  Im not saying Putins a closeted gay man, but consideration my how much he loves being shirtless in camo trousers, maybe he just needs to give in to some hot Russian bears.
t1_dud57yn	1	*	Or made memes about frogs and turning them gay.
t1_duyyhg5	0	*	It doesn't turn into nothing. Every single one of these things is a drop in the bucket that will eventually catch up with Trump. It's just a matter of when. It's a steady march in the right direction. These things don't give immediate results, but it gives us an idea of what Mueller knows and where he's headed.
t1_duh694t	1	*	I dont think anyones just directly citing that site. If someone is writing a paper, theyre either using different sources or just going directly to the references posted at the bottom of the Wikipedia article.

t1_ducz1z2	0	*	Most of the middle east and muslim countries don't have open borders either.  The saudis are beheading people left and right for being gay. Israel is committing genocide against palestinians. But hungary's law securing their own borders is an assault on human rights?
t1_ducu4ml	1	*	This is NOT a partisan thing. We all should be on the same side with the goal of un-meddled with campaigns and elections.

t1_duqmzt2	1	*	Treason is aiding and comforting the enemy, and has only ever been applied with respect to an active armed conflict/rebellion, excepting once related to a massive labor dispute - I think he was later pardoned, too.

t1_dui324q	1	*	The problem is almost all due to offshore accounts tax evasion and tax loopholes. If everyone just paid All they owe at the current rates, we'd have a massive multiplier on current govt intake 
t1_duabxqb	0	*	Bread is highly processed? Dang
t1_dunjevb	0	*	Better to nip these sorts of movements in the bud before they gain steam. Discrediting him in every way like that he's a criminal, backed by foreigners, etc etc so that if ever in the future he does gain some popularity he already has a lot of baggage.

t1_dupxml3	1	*	> But as the time passes and stuff comes to light, I no longer believe that. I do believe Russia was involved. To what extent?  Russia wants sanctions dropped and has compromising info on trump(Either financial or embarassing or both). Clinton was pretty anti-russia as secretary of state so Russia was eager to get her out of the running(they pumped bernie too).  Trump has refused to apply sanction laws passed so it's pretty obvious Russia has the screws on him and let him know it.
t1_duukp5v	1	*	USCG is allowed to board foreign flag vessels since they are not DoD and the boarding cannot (reasonably) be construed as an act of war. As a result of this, the USCG and not the Navy are used to board fishing vessels while patrolling in the Northern Pacific.

t1_dudncvw	0	*	Err this movie takes place in the same universe as Iron man and Captain America.... So you're actually wrong in the factual sense.  Its not at all shocking that a movie about an African king/Superhero eould have a mostly black cast.  It is also not suprising, for multiple reasons, that said movie would highlight and praise black culture.    I have not seen it yet, but please, by all means, see it before me! I hope that by seeing it, your opinion might change based on what is presented.
t1_dua72g8	1	*	To be fair, ppl all over the world still want to come because of the opportunities we offer. If you are really talented, the monetary, education, and lifestyle upside is second to none. We house the largest corporations who poach the best in the world to change the world.   But its a miserable place for the mediocre because theres a lot of wealth disparity and no good social safety net. If you fall under a success line it can be a cruel place because you will be treated like waste.

t1_dum18c8	1	*	At the moment, their F-15Js are already coming up to their mid-life upgrades and they stopped production of the massively expensive F-2s.   Their only option to retire some of the older F-15 airframes are additional F-35s especially with military pressure from China as the initial procurement of 42 is meant to replace the Phantoms in their inventory. 
t1_dupbdva	1	*	In this particular case, it was all just collected there and then supposed to be sent via diplomatic baggage to various ex-soviet countries. The way it read out in the media here it all seemed like a couple retiring dudes smelled a way to get rich quick and executed it very very poorly.
t1_dusm9w0	1	*	yeah I didn't expect to see this comment so high.  I love japanese culture, but when I learned about the shit they were doing in world war 2 it was so vile, I lost a bit of love.  Some of the things they were doing are arguably much more fucked up then dropping a nuclear bomb.
t1_dusyfgt	1	*	They need to get a permanent ban from all future Olympics at this point.

t1_dudq9p4	0	*	Aren't they just African? lol
t1_dug8xa7	1	*	Yep not visiting Al Jazeera  https://i.imgur.com/Y9iaexV.jpg
t1_duoylyk	1	*	Behold how high rolls a prison cry!
t1_duxk9rf	1	*	Putin knows that, which is one reason why he is paranoid.
t1_dusr9xa	1	*	Sure, just go ahead and generalise that to everyone of Iranian birth. Like all Americans are Rednecks...right? Right?  Maybe next time focus your criticism on the higher powers and people of influence
t1_dunuf0o	1	*	I thought EU banned Polysterene but nope, so should dtill be around. I haven't seen it either.
t1_duymc4i	1	*	The only difference between these people and birthers is that they know what the word allegedly means.
t1_duny7zj	1	*	Those weren't his ideas though
t1_dukh1kj	1	*	I just felt like running, for president. 
t1_duj3qyi	1	*	Glad you said the man ...was known for his integrity... he's a bit like Trump... got fuck all! lol
t1_dul3f88	1	*	Not really, the problem is that babies don't get the MMR or Measles jab until they about 15 months old, all the younger babies are totally vulnerable and it's the fault of these anti-vaxxer cunts! This story is quite personal to me as I contracted Measles as a baby and am have been partially blind ever since.
t1_duadz16	1	*	In what reality Reddit ever praise China, maybe except in environmental progress? Even then, at least 50% of the people will claim CCP fake news, actually making things worse, etc. 
t1_dujoqlg	1	*	Lol, its a bit different but there was an episode in South Park where Butters had to sift through a bunch of peoples Twitter feeds and remove all the negative comments and he like didnt sleep for weeks U0001f602  If someone was hired to track Trumps lies they would probably go insane from the lack of sleep
t1_dujfml7	1	*	Because then you have human poachers and that leads to all kind of bad shit.
t1_durg8ja	1	*	There are a lot of those in India.
t1_due9fd4	1	*	Well yes they have been trying that for years now, then every nation that has kurd majority regions starts murdering them. 
t1_dul7d15	0	*	>arresting protestors
t1_due6y6h	1	*	Or Aleve and Nexium, the active ingredients of this, for about half that
t1_duks5fx	1	*	there's another word for Russian patriots... trump supporters
t1_dupfgpf	0	*	> My kid will be homeschooled until they can figure out how to protect our children. Outlaws will always have guns even after a confiscation  You second sentence would seem to imply that your first statement is an impossibility.  Also, it isn't outlaws (career criminals) who are shooting up schools, so an actual round-em-up confiscation probably *would* make a difference.
t1_duj28ug	1	*	repressed feelings and whatnot 
t1_dudgbiu	1	*	Not surprised to see this at the bottom of the comments.
t1_duv10h1	1	*	Same when I went on vacation to Thailand. The minute you left the major tourist area, the sewage was literally dumped right into the ocean a beach over. 
t1_duvzt60	1	*	He admitted [he can't control the drug problem](http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2017/08/12/Duterte-war-on-drugs-cant-control-drug-problem.html), if that gives you any idea how it's going.
t1_ducrdew	1	*	Idk about the writing error part working in places like Facebook. I can't fathom how many Americans can't spell basic things correctly, let alone those who don't know proper grammar.  Otherwise, half of my old high school classmates would be considered foreign nationals.
t1_dulnuut	1	*	Freedom^TM
t1_duje9rd	1	*	oh right b/c riding a horse is soo gay... lol 
t1_duq0uxo	1	*	How much does a Public School Teacher make?   The median annual Public School Teacher salary is $55,072, as of January 30, 2018, with a range usually between $48,080- $63,58   Seems pretty fair to me!!!
t1_duq0uxf	1	*	But the most important source is the official statement from the FATF: http://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/fatfgeneral/documents/outcomes-plenary-february-2018.html  And it makes no mention of Pakistan. 
t1_dugq21a	1	*	Agreed! Its entertaining and terrifying at the same time. 
t1_dujb368	1	*	Bingo.  They were fine with 'russian meddling' as long as 'their' guy won.. who was Hillary. Turns out they got a bit cocky and it backfired. Now they complain because 'losers weepers'.
t1_durhsge	1	*	The sanctions would stop if they gave up nuclear weapons.
t1_duswtk1	0	*	Oh yes! 
t1_dum5kgi	1	*	I think the difference is that this is an actual new settlement. Most if the time it's new buildings in an old settlement.
t1_dukxtp0	1	*	Better that than the rest of your life in a gulag. Russia is depressing at the best of times, imagine dialing that down another ten notches and throwing a cell into the mix.
t1_dumn6sh	0	*	- Sir, there is an incredible level of gun violence in our society!  - Hmm, that is a pickle... You know what we need, dont you?  - \*sigh* more guns?  - Thats right, bitches. More guns.  - *insert gun fight montage*
t1_dumyho9	1	*	They never understood critical thinking.  They were defenseless.
t1_duptx0w	0	*	I'm for downsizing military spending and think it's rediculous how much we as a people spend on being able to kill each other but unfortunately having a military is necessary in our current world. Fuck greed, fuck extremist, fuck assholes, why can't we all just learn to live with each other.
t1_duyx8wa	0	*	how will voter ID keep the russians from infiltrating voter registration databases and changing information in the database that makes certain voters ineligible?  
t1_duic032	1	*	I think this is probably the correct response in most cases maybe with a dash of notifying the police depending on the severity of whatever the loon is threatening. 
t1_dulgcwk	1	*	The headline is misleading. No school is required to teach religion as an exam subject. As I understand it, schools that didn't teach religion as an exam subject still had religion 'classes', but they were more wishy washy than anything. 
t1_dujmqmf	1	*	UN: Like OMG! I can't even ! I'm like literally shaking!!! Someone fix this right now!!!!
t1_dup9159	0	*	Arent swaths of rain forest being destroyed for palm oil plantations? If the demand is so high that it is causing extreme deforestation, maybe we should look for ways to cut down the demand for it?
t1_dugnrmm	1	*	Doesn't matter, great president. 
t1_due495m	0	*	Sorry man, the good guys also known as Russian patriots are busy being mercenaries in Syria and Ukraine, influencing the US elections, and hacking political candidates.  Too busy to worry about money going missing.
t1_duiiulp	0	*	You are assuming that only heterosexual couples heard when he said it feels better without a condom. 
t1_dubrx1e	1	*	Russia can go fuck itself.
t1_duolefo	1	*	naive idealistic comment. almost 800 upvotes...
t1_duyp6sy	1	*	Every other week? More like every other day in this subreddit lol
t1_duofun0	1	*	They dont. A lot of Wahhabis are not happy about this news
t1_duauldy	1	*	It already has. Ministerial code is now updated to include the ban. 
t1_duq8283	1	*	Do I think they *need* Russian money? No.  Do I think they would *take* Russian money and be arrogant enough to think they wouldn't get caught? Yes.
t1_duut9az	1	*	Some guy killed a pig that walked onto his land, and that decided that the US and not UK Canada got the San Juan Islands. 
t1_dusturg	1	*	Dont forget the part where he tells his followers that he just got off the phone with Nieto, and he agreed to pay for it
t1_duntye7	1	*	I think the idea is Xi and Putin have never cared about human rights but we always had the leader of the free world at least using the rhetoric of defending human rights (and usually doing at least some things to back that up, though never perfectly or without some hypocracy).  Now with Trump, we have dropped any pretense of supporting human rights abroad. It's America first now. If it doesn't benefit us immediately then fuck you.
t1_dupclr6	0	*	Restriction!? America is all about **FREEDOM**.  The **FREEDOM** of owning guns cannot be taken away from democratic & patriotic American people.  **FREEDOM!!**
t1_duc5icg	1	*	Here in Finland you can get a planned c-section, if you are too scared of giving birth. Of course they try to talk you out of it.
t1_duqdi5f	1	*	You think the entire FBI is dedicating all of its resources on the Russia investigation? Youre delusional
t1_duq482h	1	*	Germany refusing to rewrite legislation on allowing vehicles to have defeat devices and not going after all of their own car manufacturers for cheating emission tests has left their air quality toxic. I recommend watching the first episode of the Netflix series Dirty Money
t1_dul4c7j	1	*	The sweepers make it look easy on tv but when your sweeping you're basically using your arms and core to support 50-60% of your body weight while try to move the brush as fast as you can.  Any sort of muscle or stamina boost would be a huge benefit as being able to sweep a little farther can be the difference between a miss and a made shot. 
t1_dudzeam	1	*	With our sorry tail between our legs - more obligations and less benefits. 
t1_dujf6ec	1	*	So, same cookbook the American election ran from, then?
t1_dufu9ew	1	*	I think it also has a lot to do with the [anti tax avoidance directive](https://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/business/company-tax/anti-tax-avoidance-package/anti-tax-avoidance-directive_en) that is due to come into force in 2019. Probably also why hardcore brexiteers are so against new EU rules being applied to the UK during any transition period.
t1_dumis15	1	*	If I gotta be stiff at my own funeral, so do the rest of you!
t1_duxb9vo	1	*	It would be extremely dependent on his actions immediately prior to his escape. If he'd just nuked someone there isn't a county in the world that would take him willingly.   If he'd just been forcibly removed in a suspicious coup then perhaps that would be different.
t1_duolky0	1	*	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSncgEcZcTY
t1_duqes2b	0	*	So many pennies out of every dollar donated to any political campaign came from another country. It could be nickels or dimes out of every dollar! We claim to be part a global economy and now that Trump is President we are starting to care if other countries try to influence decisions made in this country. Obviously they would be trying everyday to influence us. This is all so stupid.
t1_durc1lf	1	*	I did bookkeeping for years and as much as it sucked, I never had to count dead bodies so that's kind of a win, I guess?
t1_dui62xp	0	*	Perhaps you could vote to join the EU?
t1_dufsjko	1	*	sucks to be a shithole country
t1_dulf9lo	1	*	Heavily watered down?
t1_dudvlja	1	*	No because thats never an american goal. The goal is to make as much $$$ as possible
t1_dubhdan	1	*	After the war, General Motors, owner of Opel, successfully sued the US government for $32 million in damages sustained to its German plants (Ford Motor Company also demanded compensation from the U.S. government for losses due to bomb damage to its German subsidiary).  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Strategic_Bombing_Survey  Edit. Phone acting up and posted 5 copies of the same thing.
t1_dusx9xu	1	*	Then he would have to get re elected each term. He is by no means an FDR. 
t1_duotlpy	1	*	I had some tonight and don't know how to feel about this 
t1_duiwg39	0	*	Probably be the first roommate I've ever had who wasn't a slob.  Including the women.
t1_dusmizm	1	*	Then that's money that won't get directly donated to various conservative groups and politicians. Starve the beast by another method. So it's still worth something.
t1_duxolvr	1	*	If you choose to help your own people then its racist. You need to prioritize immigrants first. 
t1_durt7xi	0	*	In this instance the customers are responding with their money.  By refusing to pay for ads that are associated with these videos.  What's the problem?
t1_dut51zw	1	*	Except they've done this with every single administration since the 80s.   You do realise that not every event that happens is due to Trump, right?
t1_duejvyp	1	*	Pathetic ad personam. 
t1_duqyk7l	1	*	Venezuela Is not accepting foreing aid, Argentina and other south american countries are taking refugees in, but without much of a demographic plan
t1_duikzie	1	*	If you're in STEM, then honestly I'd say it's the US. Sure it's not a good country to be poor in, but if you're skilled enough to at least earn the median income then I'd say it's definitely worth it. 
t1_dufd1gf	1	*	Competition is a good thing.  Develope now... Monopolize later
t1_duba7wj	0	*	When the agenda is attempting to prevent the same tragedy from happening yet again in a country where that tragedy happens way more often than any comparable country...
t1_duydz2w	0	*	Agreed. The reason why US is acting hard on Pakistan was since the day Pakistan proposed Afghan Taliban deserves a right for talks.
t1_dul3ufh	1	*	Just like the terracotta soldiers.
t1_duuxvpz	1	*	I just like killing
t1_dusjixk	1	*	> Is that still a thing?  It was never a thing.
t1_duaeoy8	0	*	Win? He'll be lucky to run at all.
t1_dupj5it	1	*	You don't pay into NATO.  Also, the deadline (which is voluntary and just a general  goal) is like 6 years away and includes R&D investments which Germany and France are steadily increasing.
t1_dufvywi	0	*	 see the book the shock doctorine by Naomi klein 
t1_duogy2e	1	*	4chan is already completely infested with Russian bots.
t1_duf5d4n	0	*	Why are we comparing a biased subreddit to a bastion of censorship and propaganda? Comparing those two subreddits is an insult.
t1_duun32m	1	*	I've never heard of this, do you have any more details and a link? 
t1_duxp2u8	0	*	Whats the apr on leased dangerous?
t1_duhgz0p	1	*	We need a system for removing comments that clearly show the commenter has not read the article.  Downvotes don't work, because a lot of people don't read the article, and then upvote a comment that sounds intelligent.  
t1_ducoomh	1	*	The Russian bots will soon infect the feeds.
t1_dumo9dx	1	*	Not quite. Brittons share ancestry with [a muppet](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/59/Beaker_%28Muppet%29.jpg/200px-Beaker_%28Muppet%29.jpg).
t1_dutpdqf	1	*	If the black plague came back in today's world. It could literally risk wiping out 50% or more of the human population. Diseases has never had it easier in regards to spreading. It can spread from one side of the world to the other in less than 24 hours, thanks to planes etc. It's really scary stuff.  
t1_duo8nef	1	*	It's not like Zimbabwe's crack at it resulted in mass starvation or anything.  Oh, right...
t1_dusmtuy	1	*	Never gonna give him up, never gonna let him down. Because they're  thinking the same way that religious followers think: just because dear leader has predicted the apocalypse three times already and they sold their possessions and put on white sheets and awaited the sunrise on their rooftops and then nothing happened--doesn't mean that the dream of a solid, stupid answer to life's frightening questions is dead. 
t1_duezoym	0	*	Was that before or after Russian troops illegally occupied the territory?   And don't tell me they had the right to have soldiers there because of a treaty. That treaty explicitly stated what kind of troops were allowed to be there.
t1_duno17p	1	*	This is a culture that commissioned several whaling ships (which is highly illegal) as research vessels, as a cover to continue their whaling operations in the sub-arctic. In fact, they've just gotten close to finishing one of the biggest research vessels in their entire fleet.  Call it what you will, but for such an intelligent culture, they've shown stupendous ignorance of what actually goes on in their own country.
t1_duervpr	1	*	Honestly, I doubt he sees signifigant jailtime.   Mitigating circumstances  Family obligations  Etc.  He might do a month or two MAX in lockup, if that.
t1_duns28l	1	*	They have to wait and vote them out. Thats just how it works. 
t1_dueqxsu	0	*	The most formidable opponent to Putin is the Communist Party, and they have never been above 15% in the polls. Nalvany is no opposition, which is why he isn't dead yet.
t1_dura5bq	1	*	And of course, no meddling with my internal affairs, says the US.
t1_duf147v	1	*	The guidlines don't specify whether the vehicle should be moving or not but there are rules around suitable calibre of weapon and correct bullet placement. That's Queensland at least, other states may be different. 
t1_dutib68	0	*	And? 
t1_dupe6v5	1	*	If you read the article youd see that its $21 trillion since 1998

t1_dud8yt3	0	*	Where is the proof they are guilty? Also we don't execute children
t1_duof3m2	1	*	Read an interesting opinion piece i cant find right now , postulating that navalny is controlled opposition. And not living in russia , hes about the only opposition politician i ever hear about.  Edit: a word
t1_duxoe1h	1	*	being censored does not mean that you are not being heard.   in fact it implies the exact opposite as someone high up is afraid enough of what you said to try to stop you from saying it.  if dissent was as useless as westerners say it is for Chinese they would have stopped criticizing the government protesting a long time ago like what happened in north Korea. 
t1_duoouno	1	*	Ha! Jokes on you i'm too poor for sushi.
t1_dudtvke	1	*	Who is this we? Do you have a mouse in your pocket?
t1_dundl62	0	*	You know what's gonna be an even bigger inconvenience ? rising sea levels. pollutions and ruining the planets environment.  Most fish in the ocean are full of plastic particles.   You can live with some inconvenience.   In fact, make your own food next time. It's cheaper and healthier. 
t1_duljv6a	0	*	He basically died of old age. What action items are you looking for?
t1_dumnrlb	0	*	i blame nigerian bots. 
t1_dupbd7x	1	*	This. If Mueller and his team get a shoebox full of Nobel prizes it still wouldn't be enough. 
t1_dudeaze	1	*	I was actually eating tacos when I heard the alarm. I'm staying on a third floor and we lost power so friends and I just went walking for like two hours. Everyone was on the street with their pets, either waiting outside their doors or taking the chance to walk their pets and hang out with people.   Tons of restaurants are serving people without electricity. Overall I'd say vibes were chill after the first scare passed 
t1_dusm0sl	0	*	Fucking racist Fascist rant! They're aren't leaving and some are going back for the cheap peso and no need to speak English. Tonto! 
t1_dumukd3	1	*	Are we really tearing ourselves apart though? My neighborhood looks fine. I'm in Chicago by the way. The city is renovating a park near me and the shops are busy. There are people of many creeds/races in the cafe next door sipping coffee in harmony. When you remove yourself from the online vitriol and tv news the world doesn't look so... bad. 
t1_duyupjx	1	*	You know there was a before and after the pageant, right?

t1_duhgts3	1	*	They could also invite Venezuela in the group. They have much experience with the might of central planning.
t1_dummoig	0	*	 >A Harvard study found that more guns equals more homicide.  1.) Conservatives abhor facts and studies and regard them as leftist propaganda...  2.) The NRA, which backs the aforementioned conservatives, don't give two fucks as long as they can move product either here or abroad via the MIC (again, major GOP initiative)...
t1_duuez42	1	*	If this happened in a democracy, people will be doing all that. But there are many reasons why this news has not caused a huge stir in china:  1) we are used to the one party rule system, it is not a drastic shift  2) Xi is very popular (not just due to propaganda, his policies are respected)  3) some people are discussing the negative implications, but if you stand out, you will likely face some form of punishment

t1_duy5fw9	1	*	continue reform and development programmes, and to mitigate the impact of the refugee burden.  This is the big one. Jordan has borders with Syria, Iraq, and Israel/Palestine. Nearly half the population is considered refugees, and some of the largest cities in the kingdom are refugee camps. If Jordan isn't able to manage that crowd, it would cause a regional shitstorm that would be horrible for every country in and involved in the region

t1_dul94bv	0	*	When I was finishing the Leaving Cert they were just bringing in the religion-as-a-real-subject-about-world-religions thing for junior cert.   Up until about 1999 it was full on Catholicism class but there was no test attached and it was in reality a doss class where we had a procession of overly-soft-spoken young women who basically just wanted the class to not be too noisy while they got their marking done for other classes. 
t1_duswtvi	1	*	I mean, the Democrats were willing to put it in play during the budget talks, even if they didn't want to... 
t1_duhhrtm	1	*	Exactly. It's not about the sex scandal itself,  it's that the prick essentially used our money to do it. What an entitled,  hypocritical cunt.

t1_duz9uw2	0	*	america first means not spending a trillion dollars in afghanistan, or silly ideological things, but instead creating roads and rail and business in america  china is very much china first - EU should look after itself first aswell, as should all major regions of the world, and trade is what connects and creates powers

t1_duhtwps	1	*	[Studies show](https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/nasa-study-shows-global-sea-ice-diminishing-despite-antarctic-gains) that globally, the decreases in Arctic sea ice far exceed the increases in Antarctic sea ice.

t1_dumyhaa	1	*	I'm honestly pretty okay with the changing definition.  The connotation that the phrase is gaining more clearly emphasizes that trolls are asswipes.

t1_dug9epg	1	*	People are desperately finding ways to pin Trumps win on Russian interference as a way to not accept that our country actually voted for him.

t1_dudxd48	1	*	Same thing happened during my wife's pregnancy. The doctor prescribed her a drug that was a few 100 dollars a month. I looked up the ingredients and it was just Unisom and vitamin B, which I could get for 20 dollars at the store. I checked with my buddy who is a pharmacist and he said it was okay, as long as I got the doses right. So I cut up the drugs correctly and saved lots of money.

t1_duiodog	0	*	I read a report claiming almost 12,000 livestock lost to wolves in France in 2017.  12,000 lost in 365 days to 360 wolves?  So every single wolf is killing livestock every single day plus some?    I suspect something else is involved here, not just wolves.  3.2 million euros of damages in 2016, or roughly $9,000 per wolf?    In Minnesota, where wolves eat white-tailed deer almost exclusively, estimated kill rates range from 15-19 deer per wolf per year.xa0  Not anywhere close to 365.

t1_dupglfh	0	*	Apart from effectively opening all of Europe's borders to unskilled, culturally incompatible economic migrants from sub-Saharan Africa. She dun goofed on that one. 
t1_dupgqqh	0	*	Systems like these make me wonder about term limits for president. It seems like having a less powerful leader that can stick around longer makes for less political theater and more long term thinking.  For example, if a bill passes by the president's desk that's obviously good in the short term and obviously bad 10+ years from now, they'll always sign it because it makes them look good.
t1_dulbl29	1	*	That's basically what they learn in religion class though
t1_duerbor	1	*	Smells like it too apparently.
t1_duv7d2i	1	*	Very true. People are quick to blame tourism though a loooooooot of developing countries litter problems are due to lack of education, failing infrastructure and general lack of punishment around littering. 
t1_duwmwjl	0	*	Its Couillard.   Never miss an occasion to put emphasis on the Couill because couille means testicle which is appropriate.
t1_duyoewo	1	*	Sorry, what do you mean? Are you saying that you would prefer a leader like Putin over Merkel? That civil liberties etc haven't been eroded under Putin? Or that the Russian economy is doing quite well?

t1_duaesm0	0	*	Same scenario in the US I have seen in another video, except it was a man being abused, and women walking by openly laughed and celebrated.
t1_dud5j14	1	*	They wanted trump to win, for a few possible reasons:  1. They have kompromat on him and know that he will not sanction them or and will work favorably with them(we have already seen evidence of this)  2. Trump is a shitty leader and is incredibly polarizing. His long term effects on this country will be detrimental and he has destabilized our society. Trump as a president makes us weaker as a country and therefore it is good for Russia if trump is president. 
t1_dui4rzn	0	*	by doing what?
t1_du9zfnq	1	*	It really depends. A flu can be able to infect the upper respiratory tract(makes it airborne) or the lower respiratory tract(makes it deadly). It's rare, but sometimes a flu can do both. This is the case for the Spanish flu that killed 2-5% of the world's population at the time.
t1_duuy383	1	*	Extra-judicially, which means roaming mobs of random people were doing the killing. Some of the killers are affiliated with law enforcement and some arent.  A key piece of context which makes trumps statements even odder.

t1_dutp7re	0	*	I think making them mandatory is a horrible idea. This will make those people only even more suspicious of the government. Instead the government should focus on proper education on the subject. Also making this mandatory literally goes against the constitution.

t1_dumw6xh	1	*	Yep. Largely unchanged, except for the IP stuff, and the sueing governments stuff.  It's back to being a trade agreement, rather than an American corporate wishlist.  If the US wishes to join, they'll have to play by the rules everyone else has already settled on, rather than having a say in what those rules will be.

t1_dulynhl	1	*	Its hard to start a movement when everyone with a voice is silenced.
t1_duclx8r	0	*	The guy was not turned over by germany lmao. He was imprisioned while working in Turkey. Where does that retarded thought of yours come from?
t1_duw20j8	1	*	Maybe we don't deserve to survive.
t1_duxtchu	1	*	And here it is. Somehow, it's always the fault of the U.S.
t1_duhybe3	0	*	Lack of organized religion hurts people, in this case. The Papacy, for instance, is quite clear that this kind of thing is ridiculous and evil. In the good old days, this is when the Inquisition would step in and start burning the heretics responsible and rooting out the carried-over pagan beliefs that underpin it. Even in the less good old days, this is when a British governor would have the perpetrators hanged. Too much spirituality, not enough religion, that's the problem.
t1_duq8grk	1	*	https://www.opensecrets.org/orgs/index.php  They don't spend much on politicians, they just run their own ads. 50 mil last year as total spend by its own org is #9 on the list overall.
t1_dumxyxe	1	*	Cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war!
t1_dutkbl1	1	*	Because the concerns that are raised are often pieces of misinformation fed to these parents from charlatans.   Want to have reasoned conversation about vaccines? Try this: CDC recommends a combo MMRV vaccine rather than separate MMR + V; however, data show the combo MMRV doubles the risk of seizure. Let's discuss the pros/ cons of MMRV vs MMR+V

t1_dug6byd	1	*	The indictments handed out by Mueller was probably a nice memo. 
t1_dupxoh7	0	*	 >This government is conservative, they raise taxes and cut spending. They are frequently criticized for this, because a lot of people think the surplus is too high and spending on things like welfare is too low.  Welfare too low? Pardon? 
t1_dubbo7s	0	*	Alaska?  They have weed stores up there.
t1_duuz0oe	0	*	If they're foreign, especially European  (who got special privileges) than probably yes. If they were local, than there is a good chance they're probably slaves that these monstrous men bought.
t1_dukpgw2	1	*	Just more whiffy.
t1_dupo51e	0	*	You can only say fuck the military because the US has your back. (I'm Canadian by the way), if the American military didn't exist then Russia and China would be left unchecked to do whatever they pleased and your tune about the military would probably sound different (to counteract their geopolitical influence). 
t1_dujot4n	1	*	You forgot the part where he over-leverages the business, pays himself a fortune, then lets the whole thing collapse into bankruptcy leaving the average worker in debt with no hope of payment.
t1_duqn7w3	0	*	American mercenaries do heinous things all over the world. Fallujah comes to mind. Most of them were previously in the military too. I'm sure you're satisfied.

t1_dunuw57	1	*	He's been consistently criticized for that.  Either way, [Report: U.S. Air Strikes Killing Far More Civilians Under Trump](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2017/07/u-s-air-strikes-are-killing-far-more-civilians-under-trump.html)
t1_duicaxf	0	*	Yeah, he could just be like Mitt Romney and pay a higher rate one year for political gain. Theres nothing wrong with Tax Avoidance. Hes still saying the system is fucked that his rate is so low 
t1_dupvbj6	1	*	Definitely, because Germany is still run by a fascist dictator too. /s 
t1_dur4lqn	1	*	Who are you talking to? I mean, I can try..
t1_dukzcf5	1	*	In principle yeah, but based on the recent actions of Poland, it seems like ulterior motives are present in these kind of things recently...
t1_dul6g30	0	*	I'm not sure pilots dropping fuel tanks on civilians to save their own skin qualifies as something that just comes with the territory. 
t1_dudexsy	1	*	Also makes the Bernie Bros seem even more justified about the primary.
t1_dukd4mp	1	*	Kind of.  Wood is extremely durable.  It often sinks beneath the water, or into the dirt, and compresses into a substance more like peat.  Over millions of years it compresses further into a substance called coal or decomposes into a liquid called crude oil.  So really they're trying to reverse what is being done.  Unfortunately in a handful of years when this process took hundreds of millions.

t1_durqh20	0	*	Until proven otherwise, you are exactly correct.
t1_dub80ms	1	*	Free healthcare :)
t1_dulckvg	1	*	But they're not pleading guilty to anything that has to do with Trump.  Manafort and Gates effectively plead guilty to tax evasion.  It's certainly wrong of course but we're awfully far away from Trump colluding with Russia.  We'll see what happens with the investigation but let's also remember that the last time Reddit started their victory lap before the race was even over was the 2016 Presidential election. 
t1_duzf8z4	1	*	There are already a lot of stores like this. Even kroger has  bulk section where you can bring a muslin bag or a jar to buy dry goods instead of using plastic.
t1_duybeox	1	*	Well other countries that applied stricter gun rules; bought the guns and have amnesties occasionally for non-registered/unwanted guns. Worked for the UK and Australia.  But i don't see an issue for Norway here; as most hunters have bolt action rifles or shotguns. (because, you should be able to kill with one shot or learn to shoot properly before you hunt). Exception for shooting sports, but those are also the only ones that have semi's. So barely anybody is actually affected? 
t1_duus6fx	1	*	Argentina also started some beef with England on the 1980s.  Didnt go well for them. 
t1_dusm2vd	1	*	We can grow some now!! Huevos!  
t1_dujggco	1	*	So true ..   wake up .. its the 21st century people
t1_duzbqvl	1	*	the least shitty out of all media writing in russian (because we have two kinds: corrupt federal propagandist bullshit or independent small media that for some reason tend to write in this very unprofessional youth-oriented style that is super-cringy), still mediocre, which clrealy shows our lack of normal info channels

t1_duteid6	1	*	I didn't know I couldn't do that!
t1_duogirv	1	*	In my home town the cops would probably show up within a half-hour and have the tents dismantled :l Homeless people usually sleep under bridges
t1_duxm9q2	1	*	You do realize a lot of us don't want PR? I don't get where this idea that everyone who voted for him wants PR came from because it simply isn't true.
t1_dux55h5	0	*	More like your generation are too busy posting on IG and buttfucking each other like heathens to do anything.  
t1_dua1eb6	0	*	How would you or anyone else know?  Your education system is massively manipulated the same powers that are selling your globalism and slavery are good for you  along with fluoride.
t1_duroet0	1	*	He probably took in a lot of favors from all kinds of people. And now feels dumb and indebted. 
t1_duh8t4d	1	*	tbf if everyone ignored trump's tweets, the world would be a better place.
t1_duh3269	1	*	Probably not going to comment on this because none of it is related to activities during the Trump campaign
t1_duky2su	1	*	You must be a Russian then? Since you know so vividly the operating practices used by the Russian police force? 
t1_dutz7ju	0	*	...um... what? I would recommend pimsleur to learn english...
t1_dun7jyg	0	*	There was a security officer good guy with a gun at the school when the shooting happened lol. He didnt do jack shit.

t1_duqp38y	0	*	Not the biggest annual gathering by any means. The Shiite Arba'een pilgrimage for example, annually attracts crowds up to 10 times as much as the hajj does.  The hindu Kumbha mela, held once every 3-4 years has numbers 30-60 times greater than hajj
t1_duymcfw	1	*	How does a defunct investigation file indictments and collect guilty pleas?
t1_dunbj07	1	*	Wax paper straws of course.  For eat-in, there are reusable metal straws that can be washed just like metal forks and chopsticks.
t1_duf5f6q	1	*	Shhhh we're supposed to focus on the Russians.

t1_duhfgtn	1	*	India has been seeking freedom since the 70's. Seems like no one dares to give it.
t1_dujk8t3	0	*	Billions and billions and billions and billions... 
t1_dujoy9l	1	*	From how I view his supporters, I think they are fully aware of what he's saying and doing... But they don't care. They see it just as him being forced to play partisan politics and defend against liberals and the MSM, while he focuses on MAGA
t1_dup1hzu	1	*	All the Reddit coke fiends showed up for this thread
t1_dubl6m9	1	*	Really they've been doing it for years. If you listened to talk radio since at least 2000 you would be very familiar with international right wing leaders like Netanyahu, British leaders, Polish pundits, etc. The fact that they are openly favoring Russia is surprising, because they were so anti-Russia a few years ago, but Russia has slid right into that right wing sweet spot and sort of taken direction of the international conservative movement. 
t1_duqdyb4	1	*	Watch tour de pharmacy

t1_duug6h6	1	*	American gamers have been groomed for piloting drones. Russian gamers bamboozle the democratic process. 
t1_duwirzz	0	*	Pretty sure climate change is pushed by deniers to confuse people. It's global warming.
t1_duz04iq	0	*	Then why wasn't peace achieved when Ghani held talks with Taliban and Pakistan three years ago? All Afghan presidents have wanted Talibans to lower their weapons and join the political process. It's not something Pakistan came up with. But Taliban never agree and hold talks only as a distraction.eeeeee
t1_dud52jd	1	*	But.... I don't want to live in interesting times.

t1_dujjdl4	1	*	Because the GOP likely took lots of money from Russia and worse.
t1_duizwuz	1	*	Seriously! Did you watch the video? Legitimate terror and trauma
t1_duvj1ld	1	*	Education is going to be the key here. If the average person doesn't understand why throwing your trash in the river is a problem, they're going to continue doing it.
t1_dup29jz	1	*	I mean, this was all preceded by the annexation of Crimea by Russia. So of course the West is going to arm Ukraine.
t1_dusiwk8	1	*	Oh you mean because John Schuster sexy five ends are making everyone wanna bang?
t1_dutm6pr	1	*	I know it's a joke, but it's sad that people actually unironically say/think this.
t1_dur7l89	1	*	Does a story having 10,000 likes make it a credible source? /s
t1_dudv16m	1	*	It's insane. Never saw a reddit post I that I was this conflicted about upvoting.

t1_dubeeka	0	*	You use urine for Putin's name.  Rainbow glitter for Alexi's name
t1_duc5iys	0	*	It was still an empire, the distinction between Republic and Empire is an historical convention to distinguish between forms of government (Republic and Monarchy), rather than referring to foreign policy.
t1_duycsum	1	*	lol, already there and in full force. 
t1_dupoe1m	1	*	It doesn't help that america gives away billions of dollars each year to foreign countries. 
t1_dudpr1b	1	*	Wouldn't be surprised, that was an amazing book
t1_dujmsne	1	*	Yes, but you don't have to normalise it for him. Which is ultimately the biggest problem. As it lets him get away with Trump being Trump.
t1_dupuars	1	*	> If there was an Olympic sport where all you had to was ~~sit still~~ squat  
t1_dudd2zr	1	*	Just supported the two most radical candidates, Bernie and Donald.

t1_dulk89k	1	*	This is interesting. Back in my secondary school days religion classes were purely catholic driven. My parents allowed me to skip it. So did the school. I'm polish. 
t1_dui4veh	0	*	I say we just get rid of all interviews.
t1_dul4fpa	1	*	On top of that, officers dabbing rather than saluting. It is a comedy commercial spun by western sources for propaganda. And sadly, this board eats it up en masse.
t1_duvzehx	1	*	Whats the polar vortex?
t1_duq8tov	1	*	They are a terrorist organization as far as my feels are concerned. 
t1_duaikhh	1	*	Yep.  It's like how reddit responds to anything anti-left leaning.  
t1_dugxrxm	0	*	Conservative here. This really isn't what any of us wanted. I didn't vote for the guy. None of my pals voted for the guy. Conservatives are perfectly capable of recognizing a moron.   Many uneducated people are not.   Also. something something, Russia, something something...idk
t1_duf0wxf	1	*	Butt, it was absolutely mental.
t1_dunmdr9	0	*	they were on zelanian soil, not Iran. besides, equating a kiss as a greeting with refusing contact with a woman because your religion is a sexist clusterfuck is dumb. having a cultural or religious reason doesn't give you a free pass to insult others. being an asshole is being an asshole regardless of motive.
t1_dupjws6	1	*	lol
t1_duwdjwp	1	*	This needs to be upvoted to the top. More people need to be aware of this.
t1_duuqz2g	0	*	Actually the graph is live, you had to be there yesterday to read the 43xb0F/6xb0C
t1_duzkg93	1	*	Every person connected with this administration seems to have comically-relevant names, starting with Trump himself.
t1_duy00tq	1	*	the move is more towards automation instead of foreign workers. The society here is very strict, language is hard for foreigners, integration takes a long time (if ever achieved). So the government makes it nearly impossible to get here without a college degree. They would rather focus on the development of robots instead of immigration integration policies. 
t1_duwq3dw	1	*	I would think movies are based on/inspired by real life events with happier endings. 
t1_duiax3s	1	*	The key is to de-privatize capital. Stop allowing a handful of individuals to wield unchecked power.and influence over the lives of everyone else.

t1_dus8ifg	1	*	You have spoken my mind.
t1_duyxp7m	1	*	Why are you quoting this like it's somehow damning of him? So what Trump was and has been saying X leader is taking advantage of us in Y situation pretty much non-stop from that escalator at Trump tower to walking into the White House
t1_dudzn8m	1	*	Whats stunning is that no amount to discussion, exposure, or anything gets this point through to people. This article all but comes out and says, the high price is intended to get more money out of insurance companies.   Health insurance really is killing us. Some of us literally. Personally pay twice my home mortgage for health insurance for my family, so its killing me figuratively. 
t1_dufoxfk	1	*	North Wales is definitely in the Southern half of the UK geographically but yes, it's not what we conventionally refer to as The South in England and Wales. Then again I used to live in Edinburgh. Anything below Peebles was The South from there.
t1_dutpa0i	1	*	How could we increase trust in the companies that create pharmaceuticals? Why is there distrust, did they ever do anything unethical, if so - did our government have our back? If no, why not? These are simple but important questions.

t1_dudgjf8	1	*	Sorry that your post got down voted. I don't understand these people who think she is a good human being. I guess they are just going off what the main stream media tells them
t1_duujrsk	1	*	And did they?
t1_dum3yia	0	*	So we can all agree that Twitter is a cesspool of idiots and bots propagating political bullshit that we don't actually care about? Finally an issue to reunite the country :)
t1_ducs7dc	1	*	Because facebook and twitter reach much larger and diverse audiences.
t1_dundjke	1	*	Love being downvoted for stating facts. Trump has killed more civilians in 8 months than Obama did in 8 years. Fuck Reddit is a Trumpcuck haven
t1_duj6pi1	1	*	I think the black soldier represents the liberal western values that they want to enforce on us the god fearing good Russian people.   
t1_duthiiz	1	*	American warfare has led Sweden to accept a large number of refugees from countries with lower healthcare standards than us. This has caused new outbreaks of several diseases. Tuberculosis for instance, which was nearly eradicated from our country. I do not blame the refugees for this, to be clear.  Vaccines are good as we know, but these one sided share-friendly articles with a big fat title that says it all does not say it all. 
t1_duosl7s	0	*	Now it all makes sense.

t1_duuaaei	1	*	So we do need the wall!
t1_duupdoc	1	*	Yes. When it gets cold, one group says it's not global warming. When it gets warm, the other group says global warming.   Rinse, repeat. 
t1_ducscc9	1	*	Russia has close to perfected propaganda techniques. These tactics rely on core psychological failings of *humans*. Don't think this shit works because it needs a stupid target. You're just as susceptible to the effects. In truth, we likely all are. Thats why it works.

t1_duj5vwf	1	*	American children are gunned down in schools and guns are not considered to be a problem. Children of religious people are killed for religious reasons, and religion is not considered to be the problem.   People *will not* look reality in the face.

t1_dudcfc8	1	*	I'm genuinely impressed with the way they all handled themselves in that mall(?) (think it's a mall) evacuation video.  No hysteria, no one running for their lives, just a calm, orderly evacuation, with a minimum of noise.  Like they all knew exactly what to do and just did it instead of causing a ruckus, screaming their heads off or running through the crowd.  Well, except for that one kid, but there's ALWAYS that one kid.  Probably needed to go home for a nap, anyway.

t1_duyqaa9	1	*	Sure we've been able to see the finish line for a while now, but just because we're not there yet doesn't mean it doesn't exist. We are getting closer and closer to crossing it, every day.

t1_duq6yk2	1	*	Monterey Jack Man agrees.
t1_dufenv6	0	*	I guess then you have a problem with work places that have a dress code, then? How dare they, restricting your freedom of expression...  At any rate, it is not *that* important in Judaism, but the way you are approaching this is just asinine and disrespectful of religion.
t1_dui19uy	1	*	This has fuck all to do with the EU. This report is using figures from 2007-2014.   Edit; although, that said, it will get worse after Brexit, as we won't have unfettered access to the Single Market anymore.   Which kinda fucks Northern Ireland, because our Good Friday Agreement that has maintained the peace in NI is regulated through the EU.   Not that the rest of the UK has ever given a toss about us. We are an afterthought.

t1_dugcguf	1	*	Why would you occupy some land to have other people settle it afterwards? No irony in sight here.
t1_dus452n	1	*	I thought so too at first...but what would he even say that wouldn't make all of us sound like assholes..  Trump just gave his support to the NRA and wants every teacher armed.. there's no nice way of saying what we are all thinking.
t1_duc60bc	0	*	TIL the Chinese copy trees as well
t1_due4tao	1	*	Everything in the human race IS FUELED by the BOTTOM as it is.   The HUman race has been, is, and will continue to suffer for decades as long as we don't kill each other, that things have to ALWAYS cost the cheapest, be the cheapest, no matter the outliers of decision based economy.  Welcome to the half hearted tasteless, cheapful world we've created. OOOooops its already broken. Because we've made it So CHEAP!

t1_duvf3lp	1	*	Yeah. But, Donald Trump is also a joke, and look at what happened.
t1_duaf4xx	0	*	Were those hundreds of lives worth more than the thousands of Palestinians that were killed? Rhetorical question, we all know the answer.
t1_dust8m3	0	*	When Shinzo Abe is serving his 4th term as Japan's PM, when Angela Merkel is serving her 4th term as German's Chancellor, surely it is not suitable for Xi to stay in the office for more than 2 terms. U0001f644
t1_dugnthc	1	*	It's also irrelevant which one started first. One need not have started first for them to have colluded. I doubt anybody thinks that Russia is only and has only been using the Trump campaign to hurt the US.

t1_dufdr7o	1	*	What's funny is I remember my sister couldn't stand Bush when he was Potus, but now all of a sudden she's okay with him. You can't just flip flop like that after calling that man a devil for a decade. I never trusted Bush even as a Republican, his brother Jeb gave off the same vibe to me.
t1_duugegu	1	*	I Disagree, You make it seem as people are easily manipulated when in reality those who wanted Trump to win, voted for him, they weren't fooled or tricked.   Both sides use Propaganda, and both from foreign sources, why are we only focusing on Russia? Reddit is a leftist site who promotes leftist ideals 
t1_dudamb8	1	*	Fuck that bitch, this is Russia.

t1_duj732l	0	*	It's funny how one of the arguments against gay marriage was, How do we explain this to our kids? The implication being that we couldn't explain homosexual relationships without getting into lurid detail about what gay people do behind closed doors, even though we explain heterosexual relationships to kids without doing that all the time. And here is your mother showing you a prolapsed anus regardless of same-sex marriage's legality.

Both sides are the same! You can tell because Democrats are decriminalizing and trying to make drug abuse a medical issue while Republicans are trying to increase the penalty to summary execution!  Get the F out of here with that nonsense.
t1_ducszd1	1	*	I still dont understand how so many peoples lives can be so tied up in social media. I thought not having any social media was the normal thing to do. None of my friends nor my family members uses twitter or get on our facebooks anymore. Are we missing something here?

t1_dut0dy9	1	*	haha

It's OK, I'm not that into sashimi, or sushi or poke. But the first time I ate a $20 piece of chu Toro (bluefin). It was amazing. Best piece of raw tuna I've ever eaten  and by far. I had never eaten tuna like that before. Cold water tuna have so much more fat than warm water tuna. It's like the difference between wagyu beef and regular beef. 
t1_dumfgn0	1	*	I think American exceptionalism blinds a lot of people to the faults in the country and culture.

t1_duog0h7	1	*	Fun Fact: We have less doctors/nurses than cars but medical professionals still kill more people each year. Should we ban medicine?
t1_duyc6ki	0	*	I mean technically grain yields did increase in the long term, it was the overexport of grain(mostly this, they assumed that the farmers were storing excess grain secretly) and kulaks purposefully sabotaging their own equipment that caused the famine.
t1_dugslgh	1	*	I mean, they didn't. 51% voted Hillary. Just happened that the US' system 'Electoral College' is stuffed up.  Here is a simple explanation on it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_572578&feature=iv&index=13&list=PLC1C0D3F2BA472F62&src_vid=7wC42HgLA4k&v=OUS9mM8Xbbw
t1_duqes2c	1	*	It's gonna be great. 
t1_dusanuf	1	*	 Gotta encrypt the shit out of some of my files then... unless the encryption software I'm using has a backdoor in its bottom
t1_duwwrsx	0	*	No, you need to live under a system that treats you less than human effectively making you a prisoner in your own skin first before you can talk. 
t1_dur5qu0	1	*	Wouldnt this be more reason to revolt? I mean during protests on Tiananmen Square they had hunger strikes but still protested. Granted a lot were hospitalized, but they still protested. 
t1_duptzdh	1	*	He insulted the royal family in one of his songs, doesn't have to be specifically calling them idiots for it to be an insult.
t1_duq0g9a	1	*	You're a gentleman and a scholar sir, and anyone who didn't get this is neither. 
t1_dunhjvs	0	*	Right.
t1_dus4a37	1	*	God willing he comes to England and makes the same threat. He would have millions of people waiting for the little pathetic piece of shit to show up. He's a real life equivalent of the NAVY SEAL copypasta.
t1_duropgm	0	*	yeah thats completely normal and not at all suspicious in this context!  /s
t1_duw8zg5	0	*	We could detonate an ash bomb in the Artic atmosphere that would block sunrays from getting there, giving some time for ice to build up.
t1_duqvtcf	0	*	turning into North Korea
t1_duh095p	1	*	I'm cool with that
t1_dui6dit	1	*	What's going on is you're talking about something entirely different from him.  You know it, we know it.
t1_duko8y9	1	*	To quote John Oliver, We got him guys, we got him!! Wait, we didn't get him? Because nothing matters anymore? Literally nothing matters anymore???!
t1_dutcsne	0	*	Yeah they're all positive for sure 
t1_ducueos	1	*	Mueller isn't an international law investigator.    This is like asking why your local beat cop didn't help kill Ghaddafi.
t1_dufe51s	0	*	> I was a Culinary Specialist in the US Navy.  Culinary Specialist you say? Fighting off pirates? Why does that sound so familiar...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rl8pTF4f3Jg  edit: Somebody already beat me to the Under Siege joke.
t1_duseybj	1	*	Mission accomplished!
t1_duuhqpp	1	*	majority religions tend to end up corrupted by those in power. It's a great way to abuse the faith people have  in it and how people follow it to the letter. You can pretty much say vote and do x and y and people will do it. So the more people who blindly follow it the more ripe it is for abuse. 
t1_dudurkd	0	*	That's what I had assumed. In a Shkreli  thread a while back I saw people defending the price hike because the money allows for more life-saving medical research. And similar comments on discussion of an Iron Fist episode where Danny insists on selling a life-saving medication at cost, even though he is told that everyone who needs the drug will get it, and that the extra money goes towards research. But surely the price paid has to come from somewhere? 
t1_dua9nl5	0	*	Yeah it is a bit of a false equivalence to be honest.  Trump is an ass, but his political track-record is nowhere near as deplorable. Libya anyone?
t1_dujtige	1	*	You can literally be on an airplane and thousands of miles away from the US within 24 hours. 
t1_dusqwb8	0	*	This is a big mistake. Strongman politics rarely ends well when the person in charge is no longer physically capable to rule.
t1_dujukks	0	*	Yes. He should stop tweeting and report his thoughts through the corrupt media, that will surely not cherry pick what he says. 
t1_durpnsd	1	*	That because the booze is carded. In legal states the weed is now carded as well so good luck with that.
t1_ducwqhb	1	*	According to what I read it seems like they targeted volunteers and people like that were involved on the local level and people in grassroots groups who supported Trump. It's on page 17 section 45. It doesn't seem like the indictment talks about people higher up in the Trump campaign yet, but that's just my interpretation.
t1_duls3um	1	*	The title is misleading.  They were protesting parts of the deportation policy and not these specific deportations of said dangerous criminals.  Not saying I agree with the protestors, but this title is hugely misleading.  It's like an article admitted serial killer being sentenced despite protests about unjust convictions.  The protesters aren't protesting against that specific case but the titles makes it appear so
t1_dupbdml	1	*	Well sins most people wear glasses due to the lens of the eye being unfocused, cornea repairing drops won't fix many peoples vision even if real. 
t1_duwldvi	1	*	You do know that cost of life in Quebec is usually much lower than Ontario or Alberta.  A doctor can't work alone either. Why would he be making 5-10 times what the nurse makes. A working society needs to share wealth when effort is shared.
t1_dudscsn	0	*	Man, you Americans might have a lot of good things but your helth care (a fucking basic right) is so fucking ridiculous   
t1_ducixj0	1	*	Yep. I'm hoping the new CRTC boss keeps up the long and storied tradition of giving the big 3 a nice big Glasgow kiss when they get uppity. 
t1_dul5yfr	1	*	Anti-Trump forest maybe?
t1_dusobxs	0	*	Why do you want to keep the Europeans in? They aren't so bad.
t1_duixl3d	1	*	Stop that, you.
t1_dupg2me	1	*	Lets not make fun of their military ok
t1_duhcd6z	0	*	midevil is 1500ad. this goes back to dark ages 500 ad,  before the earth was round and global warming was caused by camp fires and black magic back then. 
t1_dubm5ri	1	*	Did you read the article?
t1_duw8tcf	0	*	Jail time and rehab, duration depends on severity
t1_du9z7ad	1	*	What? 7 days was for contempt. 
t1_dui9iip	0	*	Infrastructure. Education for everyone. Health care for everyone. Child care for everyone. just a few things I  could think of that the government could supply, but they just never seem to have enough money for.
t1_dup5a6a	1	*	That's because most cultures portray Jesus in their image. There is obviously a huge double standard here. White actor plays a non-white character - racist. Non-white actor plays a white character - not racist and you're racist for pointing it out.
t1_duq97gi	0	*	Take your medicine of Trump officials pleading guilty ~~. Another one just today!!
t1_dugc4uo	1	*	Coach is saving his player and himself from some pretty harsh punishments when returning to Iran.  Fuck the Iranian Theocracy.
t1_dujl0cr	1	*	lmao this is the most ahistoric thing that could ever be said about the park dictatorship. his shift to exports policy was literally run by samsung and hyundai.
t1_dun2i46	0	*	[Reports say](https://www.yahoo.com/news/suspected-grenade-attack-us-embassy-compound-montenegro-govt-060429758.html) he threw a grenade into the compound and then detonated a suicide vest.
t1_duj83bk	1	*	This. What the hell, people.
t1_duq7jpd	1	*	Lmao i heard this story last year and year before that.... still waiting... guess ill have to wait till i die 
t1_duq5ov2	0	*	It's pretty interesting to read about how deradicalization works: https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/deradicalization-is-coming-to-america-does-it-work/  edit: still a lot of questions about effectiveness, but there are success stories to give some hope.
t1_duwxas7	1	*	It's much better to make sure that people have as much choice as possible, and that it's very easy for people to use birth control, get sterilized, etc. Make it free, make science-based sex education mandatory, and you'll see significantly lower birth rates without having to force anyone into it (beyond schooling).
t1_duwhcqn	0	*	I always drink decaff to avoid the many negative effects of caffeine.  There are some good ones out there!
t1_duhvm1f	1	*	If you ask economists, [it won't even take that long](http://policyintegrity.org/files/publications/ExpertConsensusReport.pdf). 
t1_dua8eg5	0	*	Does literally everything have to be made about Trump?
t1_duqsrok	1	*	EIN: 52-1710886
t1_dutrago	1	*	Can Dueterte be Generalissimo and Trump be Fxfchrer?
t1_dug8xzh	1	*	I'm quite sure they're not smart enough to understand that plot.
t1_duprkhv	1	*	True.   But there's money in munitions.
t1_duy2hr3	0	*	He has the cheekbones for it. 
t1_duigy2m	1	*	They don't. They just need to get a lot of money from the US to pretend they have one.
t1_dud2zp0	1	*	of course it will.  too much money in war
t1_dugun9r	1	*	Fingers crossed!  Its always good for bullies to get a taste of their own medicine, and Lieberman is a particularly vile example of Israels polity, up there with the wicked witch of the ME (the truly evil Ayelet Shaked), Bennett and Nazenyahu himself...
t1_duvbm1q	0	*	My grocery store has got lots of food in it......
t1_duhgqwb	1	*	> Circumcised penises are more hygienic   If you don't have access to running water, sure   >and it doesn't take away any sexual sensation.  This is just wrong on the other hand, by the fact that there are nerve endings in the foreskin, you're absolutely losing senstivity.
t1_duxws1u	1	*	Because they don't want to be told whether or not to wear it. They want it to be their choice.
t1_dunaacv	0	*	> What is wrong with the US polititians?   Republicans. The republican party is what is wrong. The strategy of the republican party since Reagen has been Go further and further to the right every single year, which has resulted in a party devoid of morals or attachment to reality. 
t1_dulbsuq	1	*	Thank God (...) for that. I was stuck with religious indoctrination when I started high school. Terrible for morale. This is what R.E. is meant to be about.
t1_dund3vj	1	*	Also happened here in Japan. The original [Joumon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C5%8Dmon_period) were replaced by Han settlers from China/Korea which are the Japanese of today.
t1_duz8x8m	0	*	Depending on the road I can understand it. Germany is currently building a new highway road that costs more than 120,000 per meter (roughly 3 feet).
t1_duiienp	0	*	Well, you couldn't of had the Holocaust without Jews.
t1_dubnmi0	1	*	Goddammit. The bots have gone too far when they infiltrate my baby elephant gifs. 
t1_dus6cgg	1	*	Truth is not welcome here, especially if it exposes the wests support of terrorism or the war criminal state of Israel. 
t1_duutktc	1	*	That is the whole joke, Cap'n schmoov moov
t1_dura8vw	1	*	>2018 - time for the Democrats/liberals to shit or get off the pot.  Actually that time was 2008.
t1_duuz1iv	0	*	Downvote all you want, but possibility 3 (however unlikely): more false reports being made (with disregard to actual raped or reports either increasing or decreasing)  Edit: blah blah blah  Don't care. u/Drakthae's options assume that the reports are always true and that nobody ever lies. And that's bullshit. Get the fuck over it.
t1_duynwp2	0	*	Mueller is a Republican you twit. Why would he hurt his own party? 
t1_dur97gi	1	*	Russia confirmed it 
t1_duz5qbk	0	*	Trump is so mind bogglingly transparent that I'm just shocked birds don't fly right into him on a regular basis. 
t1_dujy7lx	1	*	The Putin one does not. 
t1_duuxwr0	1	*	Well that's fine with the US because they have a killing problem already so that would be one less problem overall /sarcasm
t1_durvck0	1	*	Seriously, it's fucking crazy-town of whataboutisms.
t1_dugya7u	0	*	> believe that class mobility is possible simply through ability or achievement  it is when you arent a lazy good for nothing parasite, but hey being an edge-lord is clearly working for you.
t1_dubxl1j	1	*	well better than not putting shoes on at all
t1_duoc30s	1	*	Because Russia keeps using their veto to prevent action being taken.
t1_dupir5t	1	*	Hansa OP, nerf Germany!
t1_duvb3ya	1	*	My friend visited Indonesia, and they burnt fucking trash in the street.
t1_dunzu0w	1	*	Clearly you didn't read it or the damn headline before commenting because it's a report on Amnesty International's report. If you want to completely dismiss anything Al-Jazeera says, you can find American media picking up on Amnesty International's report and reporting *the exact same thing*. God forbid you use your brain
t1_dupw461	1	*	Oil change!
t1_duqn6xu	1	*	Five-ish to seven-ish years in Club Fed.  Turning on your co-conspirators definitely has its advantages.

t1_dueeuuy	1	*	r/titlegore
t1_duduas6	1	*	> this does make the Trump/Russia Witch-hunt argument a bit more difficult to sell  No it doesn't. This whole thing is fruitlessly retarded, and what are they going to distract the lemmings with now.  Congratulations. Trump will congratulate all you idiots on his presidential twitter feed first thing in the morning rofl.  shower me with your soy downvote juice
t1_dumls5h	1	*	Modern Government? Take a quick look at history corruption is a part of human society it will always be a thing until we as a species die out.
t1_duczzz5	0	*	Sometimes the source taints the credibility of the news.  Such as whenever RT touches something.
t1_dugoqq6	1	*	Funny that Donald Trump has been trying to become President since before 2000.
t1_dun9eap	1	*	Depends who you ask and depends what news source you take as gospel. Instead of agitating maybe you could provide some good source material for both of your statements. 
t1_dusl83l	1	*	Reagan was the most Republican Republican to ever gain presidency. Trump is just a terrible person pretending to be Republican, while actually just being a corrupt business person.
t1_dudr8ct	1	*	He is special needs
t1_duqa7fb	1	*	Oh I'd be willing to pay a helluva lot if that was my goal - however it seems Russia bought some political disruption at warehouse liquidation prices and got a US president thrown in as a freebie for being a valuable customer over the years.
t1_duf9bwe	0	*	Exactly. Mutilating a baby is depriving that person of control over their own body. How a person who could assault their baby's sex organs can even be considered a fit parent is beyond me.  I suppose religion has warped so many people, we have to accept the systematic destruction of human freedoms and bodily integrity as the price of keeping civilization running. At least until we can educate people out of these bronze-age ideologies.
t1_duqjrv7	1	*	[Relevant XKCD](https://xkcd.com/1217/)
t1_duql9gl	0	*	>for all we know it could be his friends who dressed up  At least they did it right.  There have been some hilarious incidents by more left wing politicians faking hate attacks on themselves. Never ended up in an injury in those cases.  
t1_duvth2w	1	*	That's kinda the point of the article. The Chinese *don't* want it.
t1_dux1aou	1	*	> You know the world's changed when the US government responds to Xi Jinping's power play with that's China's decision.  Why should Trump care? Is Xi trying to overthrow democracy in U.S. or what?
t1_dudqoav	0	*	Check out Dirty Money episode 3 on Netflix, I just got finished watching it an hour ago and it explains pretty well what one company called Valeant Pharmaceuticals did to get around this! Its not even complicated but I had too much wine to explain it effectively. Basically they bought smaller companies, canned the R&D department and jacked up the prices on existing drugs to make a shitload of money because they can. 
t1_dug6wbk	1	*	The second one. The reason is you are crtiziznig Jews instead of the state of Israel 
t1_dui1mvn	1	*	They probably don't to be honest.  Most companies in this country seem to favour the whip over the carrot.
t1_duysn4a	1	*	I can't believe you've done this.
t1_dujtx8h	1	*	How many are true... 
t1_dux0i9j	1	*	If it was popular the state wouldn't ban it. Grandstanding when this type of stuff is already hated (and rightfully so) and made obsolete by the population of England.
t1_dutofqs	1	*	Since when are facts pharmaceutical propaganda?

t1_duot4ih	1	*	Thanks for the chuckle.
t1_duszo5u	1	*	If it happens slowly enough it won't scare enough people for it to be a big deal until it's too late.
t1_duezfxz	1	*	America is never sick of this, we've been doing it since the 1800's.  If history is any indicator, there will be a third party to pop up and gain some notoriety by winning a few toss up congressional races and then fade into obscurity after about 50 years.   No, it's that bad a lot of places.  
t1_duwev25	1	*	clathrate gun. we're fucked.

t1_dulo8pq	0	*	That sounds rather bad for China tbh. Geography's not on their side so unless India is immensely incompetent (and I do mean immensely), that standoff doesn't seem so good for China.
t1_durrgv8	1	*	War of attrition.
t1_duos0a3	1	*	So? If you go to Southern Europe, the expectation is that you will greet people with a kiss. And it will be considered rude if you don't do it. If a person comes from Spain, then they should observe the cultural norms here. If we go to Spain, then we should observe the cultural norms there
t1_duojow0	1	*	Navalny is about as popular in Russia as David Duke is here.  He isnt Russian opposition leader Navalny, he's Russian neo-Nazi Navalny
t1_duic9c3	1	*	Yep. The issue is not OMG WE NEED TO TAX THEM MORE, the issue is that the loopholes need to be addressed. 
t1_duphbgz	1	*	Those damned winter clothes biting us in the ass once again...
t1_duz3anc	1	*	They also know he's a dumbass who has repeatedly incriminated himself online. It's their job to keep him from doing it in an interview(god help them).
t1_dumxusf	0	*	Pretty sure this is only going to apply to food service places, not private households.
t1_duyka30	0	*	Yep. It's closing. He'll be taking a plea soon. He won't risk going to jail. He's a coward. Guy had to have his daddy buy doctors so he could get outta Nam'. *Muh bone spurs*! What a pussy.

t1_dugwqz3	1	*	No, it's the USA
t1_dus3dl7	0	*	Holy fuck will people stop defending Assad? I understand that the rebels are not angels and some opinions have been influenced by western propaganda, but stop acting like Assad is a saint here.
t1_dus0fw3	1	*	The next time someone at the store say Oh, what nice weather we're having down here I'm going to strangle them.   I shouldn't be wearing fucking shorts in February in Georgia. 
t1_duwynjj	1	*	You have to work with the best available scientific information of the time. The mistake was to believe the emission values the manufactures gave.
t1_dulqyah	1	*	This any the fact we had him to the White House and now this.... Im not surprised at Frump   https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/04/30/us/politics/trump-duterte.html
t1_dutwaie	1	*	More like he is very well known in the west and killing him Right before the election will make it very inconvenient. 
t1_duc84zf	0	*	apparently they can live in the white house so I would say yes. 
t1_duf76q7	0	*	What do they say in journalist classrooms these days about organizations pushing a specific view point like Fox and WaPo, is that just taught as something to be accepted or what?
t1_duikmeb	0	*	Americans are getting a stimulus check this month in the form of a tax break.   I just checked I am getting an extra $128.19 every month now. Thanks Trump
t1_duypsox	1	*	stable genius
t1_duyduup	0	*	Brexit the biggest geopolitical suicide of the century SO FAR.
t1_duz5yea	1	*	Actually been lots of buzz about this story, all over various news agencies.  Alexei Navalny, Putin critic/opposition [posted this video to give the back story](https://youtu.be/RQZr2NgKPiU)   I personally think we should start a gofundme to bail her out get those juicy details.  Supposedly she knows/worked with the hookers that Trump had with him at the Moscow Ritz-Carlton
t1_duo1tov	1	*	well, most priests are mentally ill, which is why they become a priest in the first place 
t1_dujkurn	1	*	Yeah, and Trump responded by telling the Russians it was very smart - very, very, very smart of them to not retaliate in a tit for tat expulsion of American diplomats....
t1_dukwk2e	0	*	Found a troll. Get 'im!
t1_dupw6qr	1	*	One of his charges was literally insulting the crown.
t1_dum9n4y	1	*	There are trending and promoted topics you can click on to see all relevant tweets to the topic.  You are going to see a lot of people and articles being posted here.
t1_duc207c	1	*	> European NATO also vastly outnumbered Russia in terms of modern fighter jets, modern MBT's and attack helicopters.  Mhm, the only piece missing seems to be the European's will to fight/die for this European NATO. I hope we never get to find out if this argument mattered.
t1_dunt6vo	1	*	Doesnt live in EU confirmed. 
t1_dutrtsd	1	*	Ironically, America has a lot less freedom to operate down there *because* of the dictatorships they worked with to 'prevent the spread of communism'.  Probably best to just sit this one out, and let them stew in their own juices until there's a formal invitation.
t1_dubuut7	1	*	Used to do it all the time as a scout, and at my primary school we did that for our oval, and now there's a huge ton of trees there.
t1_dupgwyb	1	*	Just writing it out is often effective, in this case $21,000,000,000,000 is missing. 
t1_dusvjde	1	*	You dont understand tariffs at all. 
t1_duzfzd2	1	*	The title is wrong. A lot of stores have bulk sections where you can bring muslin bags or glass jars from home and use those instead o plastic packaging. There's 4 of them in my town, and I live in a medium sized city in the midwest.
t1_dujd3nx	0	*	European here.  No, this is just sensible policy making. Germany's military is overbloated as is. Germany and France alone already surpass the Russian military budget... and for what?    Fact of the matter is: We need to decrease our military expenditure even further and decrease our national spending limits EU-wide.  We Europeans also need to establish an EU army and afterwards permanently dismantle NATO and generally let the US leave our borders.
t1_dulqtii	1	*	Its not even about the memorial, this is a group of crazy holocaust revisionists blaming all of Poland because Nazi's kicked their ass and set up death camps in the area.
t1_dukqln0	1	*	> Wheres the data (that should be abundant) that shows a correlating **increase in emissions** which result in such a huge graphic drop in ice?  *Accumulation* of emissions is what it takes to melt ice, not an increase of emissions.   If you want the data, look it up. Try ppm CO2 history.    
t1_dug48lq	1	*	Cry like a bitch... or just deny it.  Russian disinformation can't be stopped.  It would be better if we could get to a place where we're wary of it instead of denying it.
t1_dug89l5	0	*	Undisclosed and random aren't synonymous.
t1_duu5eze	1	*	It dropped. All the kids that would have been autistic are now dead. Mission accomplished
t1_dubrtag	1	*	Do you smell toast?
t1_dual9lm	1	*	This was my first thought, too. Haha
t1_duqth5x	1	*	I thought conspiracy against the US usually got you the death sentence. At least it did back when people spied for Russia with nuclear secrets and such.
t1_duh1yyr	1	*	The article itself is from 2017 WAY older than the 1 week the sub allows.
t1_dutnfn4	0	*	Worked there long enough to understand exactly how and why banks have raped this world. 
t1_duakvys	1	*	Its not hey...its snow.
t1_dunbg8c	1	*	They're recognizing the need and are doing something about it, meanwhile giving some time for major industries to adapt to the change. If you don't see the good in that, I don't know what to tell you.
t1_duv0iry	1	*	I think the fact that he's a sociopath is a bigger problem.  Given that, it might be better that he's an idiot as really smart sociopaths are the most dangerous (e.g. Putin).
t1_dutmeyt	1	*	this is an article written by a (left wing) american, viewing things from their own lens  outbreaks in europe can be caused by other things - recent immigration spike from third world being the most obvious
t1_dur89ag	1	*	Lmao Venezuela isn't socialist at all
t1_dudgdxw	1	*	Because you're an idiot?
t1_dur3adz	1	*	JFC.    Someone at SAA regional HQ really didn't like these guys. This was a suicide mission, full fucking stop.

t1_dujrvwx	1	*	/r/trumpcriticizestrump
t1_duykv5p	1	*	this is the collusion part.. not the election meddling part.. you seem to be well informed what the muelles investigations are about.
t1_duh79po	1	*	This is only one aspect of the investigation. This in no way clears the President from wrongdoing, either in regards to collusion with Russia, obstruction of justice, or money laundering, all of which are part of the investigation. For example, we know that Trump lied about his campaign's meeting with Natalia Veselnitskaya.
t1_durh3qj	1	*	Yeah but the *current* Japanese administration is still pretending that they didn't rape and kill millions of people in Asia while trying to take it over.   It's like if the *current *German administration has okayed textbooks pretending that the Holocaust didn't really happen and started sending storytellers to talk about how the Allies and soviets unjustly invaded Germany in WWII.

t1_dut2jhz	1	*	See the Durex ad that came out today?  Fuck until the end.    People are reposting it everywhere now.  Some people even changed the condom pic to one of the hairstyles used during the last emperor.  I heard a family member say, he no longer has a face, in reference to how much face was lost by this shameful act.

t1_dur7j8x	1	*	Same thing that happened to Venezuela pre socialist government.   Honestly the discovery of oil was probably one of the worst things to happen to Venezuela,  yes it paid for a lot of things, but since then it's led to huge amounts of corruption, which in turn contributes to the political instability they face, and all of which factors into the economic crises they've been facing as a fairly common occurrence since they became an oil state.

Our health minister agrees that this money could be better spent elsewhere in the health system. It's now up to the doctors federation to change their mind. Unfortunately, 200 doctors is a ridiculously small proportion of the specialists who will see their salary sky rocket.

t1_duntfcd	1	*	Corruption resulting in the monetization of the political systems.  We needed an outsider to host a hostel take over of one party before defeating the other.  Trump was not a mistake, hes a miracle - and precisely the hero we need right now.  Without him, we may have never known Hillary stole control of the DNC and kept Bernie at bay.  Now it looks like pay to play and an ill advised dossier may prove what many suspected for years - top leaders from both sides were corrupt
t1_dut1280	1	*	Uh disappointed? He just declared himself dictator.
t1_dufomoq	1	*	You remember in Driver's Ed, where they explain to you the collisions happening inside your body during accidents?   Now consider how much faster a plane is traveling than a vehicle, and how much more deceleration you'd experience, even without external factors. It's highly unlikely you'd recover from a 400mph + stop.  
t1_ductr1h	1	*	If major issues like this count as hysteria, maybe you should take a step back and get some perspective. The president of the USA, arguably the person who is *most* informed about issues like this, claimed up and down repeatedly that this did not happen **at all** and even fired people in order to prevent the investigation that found this. Just that is enough for this to be major news, and we're literally only on day zero of this revelation. This is far from Mueller's end game.
t1_duwys8x	1	*	The thing about fictional characters is that they need motives for the most part.  In other words, fictional characters to be interesting are almost by definition rational. They saw/had/heard X and as a result they did Y. It's important for the story one can understand the person's actions, if not always agree with it.  Random choices by book characters are almost always seen as bad writing.
t1_dublzdt	1	*	I mean, one party is allowing them to attack our democracy and get away with it without even a slap on the wrist. At this point, the choice of *which* party to help is the easiest decision in the world. Just so it happens that it's the same one that's ruining America's standing in the world.  The Kremlin spent decades trying to infiltrate the American left (admittedly, moderately successfully at times, at least for the far left). It took them two years to capture the right.
t1_duo6jqj	1	*	I don't agree, this is not the 1950's where supposed christian morals are the definer of who should be in positions of authority.  Love him or hate him but who he puts his dick in should be of no consequence to anybody.

People don't care about press freedom and liberal democracy until after they are at work and food is on the table.  Also, Navalny is a nobody in Russian politics.

t1_dutxv55	1	*	> Russia has veto power in the security council and they don't care about human suffering.   LOL.  The russians are the ones that enabled the secular government forces to keep the state together and prevent Syria from dissolving into a total Jihadist nightmare, as we see in Libya today.

t1_dudwov1	1	*	There are generics available for the 2 components its made from, just getting the 2 separately will be dirt cheap. Thats why this is so stupid, they are trying to sell 2 generics as if they magically become a new drug when they combine them and not when you just take one of each pill
t1_dubmte5	1	*	> If you spend more than 5 minutes on Reddit today you have 100% have seen, read and likely agreed with a bot or shill.  Don't assume we're all as pathetic as conservatives.
t1_duofk1l	1	*	They'll be kicked out of food courts across America in no time
t1_dutvh11	1	*	This is pretty dumb.
t1_dulrjsi	0	*	Bibi isn't religious.
t1_dupfr0d	0	*	Yes, it definitely does.  That is exactly what Lasik and other eye surguries do - reshape your corneas.
t1_dui7623	1	*	he's not representing Russia, he doesn't have a flag on him so piss off. also you can't control every single athlete on doping.
t1_duaf0r9	1	*	I'm sorry that you feel so attacked, that you interpreted the article that way. No one in the article said anything about Brexit voters being idiots. The article simply states a guy's opinion, that Brexit was a mistake which will have economic and political consequences. 
t1_dug8wev	0	*	My thoughts exactly.
t1_dulpe0e	1	*	it doesn't make any since? 
t1_dudmx1p	1	*	Not really.  This is to do with election interference through social media outlets against all candidates being not Sanders or Trump.  They worked to play both sides by coordinating opposing rallies.  Their mission was to create disorder.
t1_dusvoos	1	*	First he came for the personal enshrinement. Then he came for the freedom of speech.  Finally he came for the constitution. 
t1_duql8wv	1	*	I don't think anything will ever happen to fb. Every time any new social media app/site/whatever gets popular fb just buys it.
t1_dueue9u	1	*	I agree world dictators usually change for no reason.  
t1_dunak23	1	*	Anyone have that 4chan greentext about equipping school kids with riot shields and drilling them like Legionaries? 
t1_duplw3r	0	*	That only costs money. Cut his balls off and drug him for the rest of his life. A productive eunuch is much better than a paedophile rapist prisoner.
t1_dunbtqx	0	*	..why don't they just come out and say we beat him to death? Nobody would do shit!
t1_dusi0uh	1	*	This pointless boondoggle is definitely *not* for any benefit to Mexico. It won't be of any benefit to the US, either. Maybe Trump could take that $20bn and put into the crumbling infrastructure all around us, which would be fulfilling a campaign promise that pretty much everyone can agree on.
t1_dum6y8l	1	*	Play 3: it is important for make great glorious people's that all attacks be compared to every other nation, not to justify actions, but to change subject so we not have to admit what a broken, fascist shithole russia has become. 
t1_duhx0s8	1	*	Theyre also not in as much personal debt as you Brits. To lazy to pull out stats, but you know what Im talking about right?
t1_duex76v	0	*	I don't think this is actually fooling any of the appropriate military forces / institutions. Might be a distraction for the general populus and that's about it 
t1_dutmuxw	1	*	I think Trump will have to make it past 4 years for that to be a problem.   
t1_dusg53k	0	*	> Most Americans are aware that America First is hate-speech no different than white power!  Good lord, you need to take a break from the internet for a while.  
t1_dupdyzx	1	*	> Or horrible recon.   Shit's like the last season of Game of Thrones. Except that there is no plot armor.
t1_due06cp	1	*	Similar thing for a newer type of accutane. The drug is $800/mo, but if you ask for a free discount card from the manufacturer it's $5/month. Insurance is not applied at all. It's mind boggling. 
t1_duvekcm	0	*	Had Stellaris vibes for a moment. 
t1_dui9iky	1	*	France Francois Hollande implemented a Millionaire's tax and they lost more income from that group the following year.  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4269494/France-lost-millionaires-year.html
t1_duz0hik	1	*	I think every Republican politician in the country would be hunted and brutally murdered inside of two hours.
t1_dulzzc9	1	*	and studying religion in school made me a pagan and made my husband convert from Islam to Christianity, and i know quite a few Hindu's thanks to that Class. People really underestimate the importance of religious study. It is thanks to it that I am Pagan and quite Devout(as in i don't treat it casually) 
t1_duhmqns	1	*	I cant think of any jurisdiction where that wouldn't be considered anti-competitive practice.

t1_duqrwz0	1	*	He is banking on a pardon. It is the only logical motive behind his actions.
t1_duwlabx	0	*	Many, I would guess.  This negociation was between the Doctor's Union and the Gov. The agreement was voted by the members prior to the outcry. 
t1_dudxg0h	1	*	This sounds dangerous. Your country should ban them. 
t1_dudrrm2	1	*	It's like Udemy courses. They are never meant to be bought at 200$ each.. Because they always have a sale and you get them from 10-20$
t1_duorfr9	1	*	That's a bad look... even if something is in his power he doesn't want to be criminally unpopular. Just unpopular enough to do the money laundering he needs to do and get away with it. 
t1_durz2k5	1	*	Really? Last time Labour were in power we were in a boom for 12 years. Everyone was getting pay rises and were becoming better off. The last 7 years under the Tories every year has had no pay rises or pay rises far under inflation. Austerity doesn't work, and I'm desperate to try a different economic policy.
t1_dur4m4k	0	*	The good news, his term will end.  If the US elects this shit show into a second term then Ive lost all hope for the American public.  Im going to move to Canada or Norway.   Edit: typos
t1_dujpvjp	1	*	But as president, he is the Feds! I guess that explains why he's always on vacation. 
t1_duk9upn	1	*	Just for the record, Trumps avg approval rating is above 40%.
t1_duw17sw	1	*	What happens is that the atmosphere becomes more disturbed as more energy goes into it, so it doesn't just get warmer -- it gets crazier.  Right now, the atmospheric vortex that's supposed to be over the North Pole is over Europe, and vice versa.  This is why climate change is best described as 'global weirding'.  As this phenomena worsens, we'll see more bizarre heat waves and cold snaps, which may eventually make agriculture challenging and doom the human race.
t1_durdyq5	1	*	>On one hand I wish there is never an atomic bomb used on innocent civilians.   By all accounts, no one expected that the civilians would fight any less fiercely than the soldiers.  > On the other hand, will Japan accept the atrocities they committed to the Chinese before parading its own victims?  Highly unlikely 
t1_dupwdl6	1	*	Their navy is pathetically small (the Netherlands has a larger navy)...If they had great ground and air forces, it would makes some sense, but they don't.
t1_dueeigv	1	*	Would that we could say this everywhere!
t1_durdkth	1	*	Really good to know!!
t1_duxjfl9	1	*	Yeah they found pussy
t1_dui9qd9	1	*	Your link is Gross Real Disposable Income, which is already adjusted for inflation. Just so you know
t1_duqv757	1	*	Still not Trump though. All i can think when i see news like this is ok, cool. Trump is still POTUS, but this is neat.
t1_duglrev	1	*	If you think that Germany isn't spying on American leaders then I don't know what to tell you... except that, yes, they are.
t1_duwc3y0	1	*	Guess they don't care Chinese peoples feeling. but they care western people

t1_dugbebz	1	*	...Fat chance it EVER happened!
t1_dush1le	0	*	Theres an old man in my neighborhood who drives an SUV he can barely see the wheel over. He got tired of waiting and yet made the slowest left, he was almost T boned. He drives around here like he owns the road...like because they are old they cab even drive however they want, they are fine.     Ive been wondering if I shouldnt alert someone....
t1_duhl1fc	1	*	if you drill deep into the ice and analyze the tests samples you get up, you can see further back then 1970s
t1_dur3n9k	1	*	They're not dark enough for Gitmo.
t1_duu7cri	1	*	You're arguing it completely incorrectly. Even just mentioning autism means you're assuming something might be there, and that's enough for idiots to go against your argument. You should just say something like shot are safe over and over again to reinforce the positive message. The way the human mind works, just putting two ideas in the same sentence makes people automatically assume there's a link when there really isn't one. I made bestof by saying this exact same idea btw. 
t1_dul3wna	0	*	Modi representing Indian anti-intellectuals. What's with right wing and its hate for science? 
t1_dutnjrj	1	*	I know here in the US, its mostly the middle/upper classes.

t1_dupr7qr	1	*	Quit complaining and create some jobs.
t1_duwty13	1	*	That's the thing they don't see. South Africa's Economy is large compared to other African countries but the average black African is Broke af.   I saw some sort of detailed plan on the SA subreddit (or detailed suggestion not sure which) that kind of paints a better picture of his plan than just land grabbing. He seemed smart when interviewed on CNN I think... I'll see what actually happens, no one that intelligent would want to be Mugabe 2.0
t1_dup6ejv	0	*	So you *don't* want to have nanobots laser your eyes based on an app you're supposed to use at home by yourself? /s  (I didn't make it up, read the article)
t1_duib24z	1	*	Imagine there's a big heavy block that needs to be moved across the room. There are 5 people in the room and it will take all of them to lift it. 3 of them don't want to put in the work. The other 2 know how important it is, but if they try to lift it without the others they'll just strain themselves and accomplish nothing, so instead they try to convince the other 3 to pitch in. There's no point wasting energy until they have enough hands that they can actually accomplish something.

t1_dueopa8	1	*	Actually, thanks to Donny, there aren't many countries that are friendly with Trump.  
t1_duulf4h	1	*	That's no moon!
t1_due8nx8	1	*	The conservative groups involved include the Heritage Foundation, which has pushed for the lifting of environmental protections, and the Cato Institute, co-founded by billionaire oil barons Charles and David Koch. In Britain the project is being overseen by the Initiative for Free Trade (IFT), an organisation founded by the hard-Brexit advocate and Tory MEP Daniel Hannan. It's right there in the article.

t1_duvord0	1	*	Sounds like a spy
t1_dujqga5	1	*	You should read the article and formulate your own ideas instead of allowing other people to come up with them for you.
t1_dujnn7b	1	*	I think the same. At least the media is criticizing Trump instead of carrying Obamas water as scandal after scandal pass unnoticed and the result is the media declaring a scandal free presidency.  
t1_duoxuyf	1	*	 **Sergeant Gerry Boyle:** You lads always announce seizure of drugs worth a street value at $10 million or $20 million or half a billion dollars. I wonder what street it is you're buying your cocaine on, because it's not the same street as I'm buying my cocaine on.  *The Guard (2011)* 
t1_durb04f	0	*	On the one hand, I wish two planes had never killed thousands in NYC. On the other hand, will America ever accept the atrocities they committed to the Vietnamese before parading their own victims?

t1_dugw9x9	1	*	I was just mentioning that in another comment. Glad to see someone else also brought this up-that governments have ordered athletes to boycott games before due to politics and it didn't change the political situation.

t1_dujewmz	1	*	Because other than the US and Japan, no one wants a war. Especially over nukes, which they've had since 2006.
t1_duwjxgj	0	*	People buy it because it is known to be expensive. A brand psychology. They want the outer world know they can afford. 
t1_duwgngf	1	*	Maybe the North just wanted to use the Nukes to send South Korea some Freedom. If they succeed and send enough Freedom to the South, they can reunify with a 'Free' country and by Free i mean free of people.

t1_duph943	1	*	If you remove the US from the military scale, they have a strong military.  The entire purpose of military alliances is to pool resources and protect one another when needed.  The US could cut its funding in half and have no real impact. It would still be #1 by a large multiplier.

t1_dut3x73	1	*	That's because it's a purely parliamentary system. 
t1_dubxu9v	1	*	Id say this is a fairly accurate answer
t1_duwoxvs	1	*	That's exactly why Quebec honored what was promised to the doctors in 2007. It's not like the PM just woke up and thought *hey a raise for doctors would be nice!*.
t1_dubcmco	1	*	This media website is blocked in Russia. There is now way it's targeting Russian people in Russia. They'd have changed the domain name already right? So you might wonder who is this website targeting if Russian in Russia can't even access it.
t1_dun97or	1	*	Those were either:  * outposts: which are illegal under both international law and Israeli law   * expansion of old ones / in Jerusalem  this is a map of the situation ( but I don't know if it's been updated in 2018): https://archive.peacenow.org/map.php

t1_duds1cl	0	*	This isn't outsmarting big insurance.  One of the regulations in the ACA is that the insurance companies can only make a small profit margin (IIRC, it's technically that they must spend a certain percentage on care), and thus if they spend more on medicines, they can make more money.

t1_duq4r02	1	*	The title is bullshit. It's rapes and violence based on sexual and then the online aspect. Whomever made the article at BBC is an idiot.  I'm not saying rape and such doesn't happen, but one in 8th, for as i know french women, by now, they would've cut every dick in the country.  I'm so sick and tired of BS journalism, there ought to be an independent panel that basically pulls these so called Journalists by the ear, public shaming seems to be the last thing they are afraid of.

t1_duvdvy7	1	*	Consider visiting Nusa Lembongan! It's not too far from Bali, just a short boat ride away but it's not as touristed and considerably cleaner from what I remember. The diving was spectacular as well, the coral was healthy and we saw so many creatures - mola mola, manta rays and dolphins. 
t1_dul3op4	1	*	But what about primary school? I may be wrong but I thought I read that large parts of Ireland have no public schools that are not religious schools teaching Christianity.
t1_dud6db5	1	*	That site everyone was on in 2012.

t1_dun7mav	1	*	Your comment lost a lost of steam there at the end. I'm not sure if you were talking about Russia or the US and then brought up some space race that happened 50 years ago.

t1_duesqp9	1	*	About 2.30
t1_duv6b0v	1	*	Well, don't take 3. I got a scrip for that and kinda liked it. I take adderal for ADHD during the week when I'm working and I found phentermine to be less disruptive but still functional as an appetite suppressor and milder way to keep me focused during the weekends when I don't need the harsher stuff.
t1_dujpfmm	1	*	Pretty sure there are many people with that exact job description. 
t1_dun8pe6	0	*	He should not be joking about this. He's leading the committee responsible for investigating interference. The fact that he may be joking makes this no better. He's a fucking embarrassment to the congressional oversight and investigative duty. Fuck him.

t1_duqn2nw	1	*	Well, given all the trash-talking of NATO and pay your own way grandstanding by the current administration, Germany may conclude that the US is no longer a reliable partner for defense.   So they'll start beefing up their own military to protect themselves from Russia.  Massive military buildups by Germany have traditionally ended so well... 
t1_dugvr8i	1	*	Yes. This is called 'top secret' and Trump is too stupid to understand that.  
t1_duojyk6	1	*	All you need to do is ban them for 5 years and the species will be back to normal strength.

t1_duejyn0	1	*	Reunification with whom is the real question.
t1_duicbks	1	*	you don't really notice because there is an entrenched class of people who get various kinds of pension schemes/state jobs and can easily afford to keep their children in stasis.   This is why people keep their grandma in the freezer when she dies. 
t1_duwnjgj	1	*	I am also pretty sure stupid questions are asked everywhere, everyday so that brings me to the point, was your question any different ? and the answer is no, it wasn't, so try to think harder next time, before you ask such a stupid question.
t1_duw7a71	0	*	But where would we get our official presidential statements from?

t1_dunj56i	1	*	They said *by* 2030, meaning that by 2030 all of that should be gone. It implies that it will take 12 years or time, in general, until all of those utensils are gone.
t1_duz7y5i	1	*	Glass isn't actually expensive. Ketchup in plastic bottles costs more than ketchup in glass bottles. Plus its more easily recycled.
t1_duh8xxt	0	*	Honestly, I don't give a shit if it ends Trump's presidency or not. I want Russia punished for attacking the United States.
t1_dud2auz	1	*	Funny because at anytime the state could have had this kid committed automatically barring him from owning guns.  The FBI could have nailed him with terroristic threats and sadistic acts barring him from owning guns. This falls on the justice system.
t1_dukzjgp	1	*	Damn you're right, Putin IS a coward...he doesn't keep it a buck.
t1_duhu7ly	1	*	One thing at a time. Also, dolls don't quite fit the mold here. We're talking about single use plastic items like straws and bags. It's probably good if children's toys don't biodegrade very quickly.

t1_duigryr	1	*	>The defector told the authorities she made contact with the regime because she wanted to go back home to her son and was sending the rice as a sign of loyalty to North Korea in order to avoid being punished for defecting.  Must be terrible over there if you send rice to not be punished for leaving the country.
t1_duw9zxl	0	*	It's not like you can just get a North Korean proxy, VPS or VPN, and go through there. It would require some effort, and there are lots of other countries which would be easier, which means NK was chosen for other specific reasons.  A false flag operation is one where you disguise your own affiliation, and that's it. You can perform a false flag operation on your own organization, but that's not the definition.
t1_dujg8v8	1	*	Third paragraph of the article.  >The decision came as Cape Town announced its water saving measures, which require each citizen to use less than 50 litres a day, had successfully pushed back Day Zero to 4 June.
t1_dujvtxv	1	*	You can still be a republican without supporting Trump. Shit,  you can still support Trump without having to agree with him on everything. If you read the article it states how he was lying. No need to blindly follow someone. 
t1_dut4fv9	0	*	Plus all of the other words before and after those, which are needed to put together a complete sentence.  
t1_dutw837	1	*	I love this comment.
t1_dupj6vq	1	*	I say its time for some rallys. What could go wrong.
t1_duqlr7n	0	*	That would basically be an admission of guilt in a political sense. Every GOP supporter of Trump in Congress would now be facing the question in the coming midterms Why pardon them if they did no wrong?

t1_duw1b1u	1	*	Cant stop, wont stop!
t1_dugk68s	1	*	I wonder what the conversion is on years in Iraqi jail to years in German prison. Probably a rough exchange rate.    I'm still surprised they didn't kill her outright.

t1_dui9ytm	1	*	Haha i feel the same in the UFC, the winner gets interviewed on how he won the fight, he thanks all his people, he gets his day in the sun, and then, not 10 seconds later... Let's turn things over to the guy who just got his ass whooped, how do you feel? LOL they are usually consummate professionals who accept their losses/shortcomings but man, talk about kicking someone when they're down
t1_duk22za	1	*	He does.  But he knows his base doesn't. 
t1_dud9nn7	0	*	Its unfortunate that they only developed writing so late. It you have been great if they had come up with it a thousand years or so earlier so more fit would survive.

t1_duhbvl5	0	*	People acting kind after a tragedy so they can post it on the internet and receive digital back pats. 
t1_duycz0j	0	*	There is always some kind of mass shooting in America every year, so using that logic any gun regulation in the world is in direct response to american shootings.  The world does not evolve around America.
t1_duk1myc	1	*	This is one of the few things I've ever seen that is homophobic in the most literal sense. Instead of hating and wanting to hurt or kill gay men the protagonist of the video seems irrationally scared of them.
t1_duvq7gj	0	*	The difference is that right wingers in the West aren't being armed by NATO and their allies  I'm sure if they had billions of dollars worth of military equipment, they would kill a lot more.
t1_dugmwv5	1	*	The official line now is they are glad Russia has the same interests they do.  Trump calling those interests anti-US threw a serious wrench into this line of thinking though.  They need another Hannity segment before they can respond again.  
t1_durv2i2	1	*	NPR is the opiate of the hippies.  NPR is status quo not particularity liberal 
t1_duiaju2	1	*	I'm pretty sure he's not a fan of paying to have things change in a democracy.  It just shouldn't be that way.
t1_duqa20s	1	*	Na fuck him he wants to play his little fucking game, but all he is is a sad little gay clown. He wanted to play his game, but you know what? If trump is found guilty (and punished), then we win. It means that our democracy is strong enough to survive and get past this disaster.   The only way america loses is of nothing is done.  
t1_duja5fr	1	*	you say 'suck some cock' as if it is something bad. are you homophobic?
t1_duxavuj	1	*	It is if youre dumb and misinformed, though, especially when you also throw in a bit of class envy.  Just finished a 72-hour small town ER shift where I had to make decisions for my team constantly (because thats what we do as doctors) and also explain to a phlebotomist that its a lot of paperwork for me at 1 am is not a valid reason for refusing to set up a transfusion for someone with major trauma.

t1_dukg0on	0	*	I'd rather a million bandaids than never trying to fix anything at all. 
t1_dujk33r	1	*	Yeah, countries are not all on the same wavelength. Like think of Russia culturally as 1980s America. Like when our government willfully let HIV to spread because they thought it would kill all the gays.   China also considers gayness to be tasteless and transgender a mental illness. Just because it's accepted in America and some of EU doesn't mean that most of the world agrees. 
t1_durhjj2	1	*	It doesn't seem like the flu could become resistant to it based on how it works.  It says the flu multiplies by taking over a particular enzyme in the body and that this drug suppresses your body from making the enzyme in the first place.

t1_duugnit	1	*	Asymmetric warfare ftw. $1.25m/year to **fucking poison the well** of civil discourse and electoral process in your greatest adversary. An adversary that, by the way, dwarfs your nation in every conceivable measure.

t1_duv39lt	0	*	Ah, the fire trucks are almost as hilarious as the ambulances.  For those curious, Zambia bought 42 fire trucks and spent about $1 million each. The trucks are not worth that much.

t1_dujf5x6	0	*	Seems like a pretty high figure, 20% increase on their current employees. Didn't realise there was that much trade between the two.
t1_dudd7gy	1	*	Western companies have used cheap Chinese labor to successfully brake western labor unions, they now want more direct access to growing Chinese consumer markets.  Greed has no bounds. 
t1_dusy90u	1	*	We have yet to see how Trumpaloompa feels about abdication, wether it is premature or not.  You might come home to a similar situation.

t1_duimbrg	0	*	When I was in Costa Rica, the guides who would bring people to watch nesting sea turtles were former poachers - they could support their families better from American ecotourism bucks than by bringing the turtles home, and they were using the same skills to find them.
t1_duvc7wt	1	*	scorch the earth was probably used here. not one foot soldier was used. Also in Vietnam u.s just tried to stop the movement of communism and they failed, so they eventually left. it was never a conventional war

t1_duwwz3h	0	*	While an old 68er (as we say in continental Europe), he's still classic leftist old guard. I think he and other established leftist leaders over the Western world are doing what they believe the youth is down to with this identity politics crap, without really understand it, and while failing to grasp that these are just the demands of a loud, small minority.  
t1_dutvm1h	1	*	Inb4 Trump makes a Tweet about how China is doing it right and we should follow their lead. 
t1_duoz93n	1	*	I heard blue fin tuna is expensive, so it probably ruled out most sushi eaters.

t1_durcek6	1	*	I am sort of torn here the same.  There were some alternative history questions if the two types of bombs were being dropped regardless for testing.  But Japan is much less interested in it's flawed history during WWII than Germany is while being quite willing to talk about the first use of nuclear bombs.   And between the bombing campaigns and the ground assault by entrenched and a fully committed population, per this the numbers would have been comparably ugly.  War sucks.

t1_dui2gwk	1	*	Here is the problem with you arctic ice statement and pretty much any argument deniers use saying we gained ice. They are using satellite images so while it looks like we gained ice and its expanding the reality is the ice is just getting thinner and is more easily effected by wind meaning it gets pushed easier giving the illusion that we gained ice when in reality it is just getting thinner nd spreading out more.

t1_duooxvm	1	*	Starvation Boogaloo?
t1_duwqx2q	0	*	They also deserve to be supported by nurses who aren't burnt out from being highly overworked and undersupported. Nurses do the majority of diagnostic work and administration of medicine and treatment. They put their lives in danger and make a fraction of what doctors do. And nursing school isn't exactly a three-day knitting class. These doctors are asking that the money be used towards the resources (HUMAN resources) they need in order to perform their jobs properly. It's more than reasonable.
t1_duw70rb	1	*	They are looking for seeds that have a future.
t1_dua5ons	1	*	Very misleading
t1_duq9tsq	1	*	They are so deep in this Trump/Russia collusion rabbit hole that they cant come out with nothing without looking foolish.  Theyve been grabbing at straws for over a year for anything that might discredit the man and prove they were right all along...
t1_durs86p	1	*	The VOA managed to get the tapes from a Kremlin source, the Russian political opposition is actively challenging the official narrative, and bereaved families have also been pretty outspoken (about losses in Ukraine as well). I wonder how much this pressure this domestic discontent is actually putting on Putin's autocracy. 
t1_durnokd	1	*	not to mention america greatly helped to re-build japan and dumped tons of money and resources to get japan back to modern - something I dont think other kinds of empires would do  america has acted as their countries entire military and defense ever since then  america has been very generous and japan and america have an EXCELLENT relationship, since post ww2 and to this day - so people who moan about america bombing in ww2 need to get some context

t1_dufncow	0	*	Quality journalism is the only thing that gives us any real level of transperancy in government. Best case scenario would be a truly transperant government *and* healthy journalism but losing journalism would enable corruption to go on without anyone ever even knowing about it. We'd be even more fucked. It has to stay, it's a fundamental necessity.
t1_duiif4q	1	*	You gotta prove corruption, I don't like him but I don't really see any evidence ever presented

t1_duhmqyn	1	*	A large majority of everyday people dislike Trump's core philosophy. He spreads lies and nonsense about his peers. The only 'right' thing is to vote democrat in 2018 and 2020. Help stop his fascist ambitions!

t1_duq8e7b	1	*	no they have lots of reserve gold and oil but US sanctions make it illegal to buy any of them...which makes me think why even have reserves...  they have the largest oil reserves in the world and it was at one time 90% of the exports so u can see why now without the ability to sell it they are fucked...  its like telling US foods they cant sell food products anymore and then blaming the CEO ahahha
t1_duzfc4h	1	*	One way to discuss this would be to look at Norway's example re: investment in the energy sector.  Huge up front investment and public risk.. years of cost, years where any ROI was understood to be deferred.. and now look. The return on that investment at one point became a problem: how to invest the public returns quickly enough such that the economy did not melt down.   It is an interesting example, just giving you a very limited understanding based on a presentation I attended years ago.
t1_duejb33	1	*	It's a threat I think to the rest of the trolls. Keep doing this and you can't see the world, ever. Probably meant to intimidate.
t1_dudjnz0	1	*	No. The laws remain the same. People will still be free to do what they want. The only change is that the police will be controlled by the army, which is controlled by the president. The governor (which is a political ally of the president anyway) loses decision power over the security in Rio, but doesn't really change anything. 
t1_duqyc6c	1	*	Tax evasion...mmmk.

t1_dupogjy	1	*	He wasn't though, the ruling party chose him to be their presidential candidate for this years elections, then got rid of the old one (Zuma), so now Ramaphosa is in. 
t1_duiadfo	1	*	I know this is a shitty counterargument, generally speaking, but why can't he just voluntarily pay more to the US govt? I think the argument is shitty because it's usually pointed at someone who definitely isn't Bill Gates. But in this case, he could and is even literally saying he should. What's stopping him?

t1_duq6vht	1	*	No it won't this is oil that is being mixed with gas. That means if we ban mixing. Then the supply goes down, nothing will replace it. EU uses 98% of palm oil on gas. So the palm oil import will basically die.

t1_duqtnxt	0	*	This is a common misconception. Venezuelas economy has been crashing since the early 2000s, and it still did horribly even as oil prices skyrocketed. Ive found BBC articles about food and other product shortages going back to at least 2003.

t1_ducf3v7	0	*	It just goes to show the importance of geopolitics over ethics. A country's strategic location has far more influence on how it is handled than any matter of democracy, freedom, or human rights.
t1_dusb66f	1	*	I agree. The work sucks. We don't want to do it. But as always in America. We would adapt. Automation would be pushed further to solve the problem. We don't need any more immigrants here in the US. I don't hate them. I just want them to stop coming and leave. They don't adapt to our culture. They recreate the same dirty inconsiderate mess they have back home in our neighborhoods. We don't need that.

If little Johnny can find the sex toys stored in your undies drawer he is going to find the handgun in your dresser and the rifle in the hall closet.  This is actually part of the control laws in Australia and is part of why the worked.

t1_duien95	1	*	The exclusive license for a drug should be non-transferrable. Once the creator of the drug loses it, (through time or trade) there should be a mandatory opening to generics
t1_dumapn8	1	*	This is just like Trump and his supporters' normal strategies:  use something small and meaningless and present it as something that represents the big picture.
t1_duuv2gs	1	*	I think Pharma is more the equivalent of Duterte's son. He's killing off competition, not so much the drugs themselves.  
t1_duv1576	0	*	And what happens after Xi? Legal systems that restrict a leader's power and ensure peaceful transitions of power are vital to a country's wellbeing. Deng could've stayed on as a leader for life with overwhelming support if he wanted, but he understood that rules exist for a reason.

t1_dufajtp	1	*	The Florida kid was like this too. Often people respond to this sort of thing is followed up by people saying something like they were never a violent person, I never imagined they could do something like this (actually we had a local horrifying random attack this week where a friend of mine knew the perp and said precisely that) but with these guys, people that knew him come out and say yep, they're *exactly* the first person I'd expect to kill somebody.
t1_dui7rmw	1	*	This is something I never understood. Many of these lawmakers take like 3 grand to push bills. Is there like an auction or something that happens behind closed doors? Why is it so little, isn't there someone that can pay more? I don't get how it works

t1_durnks9	1	*	Dont get depressed. There is nothing out of the ordinary happening and if you loom to out past there has been bigger and more severe climate change not that long ago and the world was just fine. Some species might die and there will be some consequences but nothing severe will happen. Instead of listening to fear mongers I suggest you look into the scientific data.
t1_duzai9c	0	*	A grain of salt may not be enough. I use at least a spoonful of salt whenever I see stuff from RT. However, I must note that RT caters to foreigners, so they tone down propaganda a lot. Compared to a lot of internal (state-controlled) media sources, RT is like CNN vs Breitbart.

t1_duu40fy	1	*	No one has been silent. The west has been funding literal terrorists since the start of this war.

t1_duq7pwp	0	*	Im not surprised by your surprise here, Fox viewer.
t1_dusiwie	1	*	The president is frequently the main figure head on behalf of the United States. Ive never known a conservative to 'cheer' for the humiliation of the country even if they didnt vote for the guy in the primary. Then again, I personally dont consider this as humiliating as the recent leaks, lies, and political scandals of our government, FBI, state of the union address drama, and the courts. Why do you? Also, do you believe the president of Mexico is worthy of high regard?
t1_dus3ybg	1	*	Given trumps full support to the NRA it could caused a war

t1_duoxoq8	0	*	don't forget the millions of Americans that lost middle class jobs to NAFTA and the 11-13 free trade agreements since.   Luckily, many of these folks went into technology related fields.. and  were then outsourced to india, china, brazil. etc..  Good thing that doesn't have anything to do with the pay gap, declining social mobility, underemployment.. then people might start to question the wisdom of free trade and the biggest transfer of wealth in history  Can't have that, now

t1_dubj15b	1	*	Russia could care less about gun rights in America, any issue that sows division and/or weakens the United States is fair game.  Wired is not taking sides in the gun rights debate, the issue being addressed is pro-gun bots are the latest incarnation of Russian trolls.  It would not be unfathomable if they also enacted bots arguing against the 2nd Amendment just to cause further dissent.  They did this with the NFL kneeling controversy, promoting both sides just to escalate the discord.

t1_dui90ny	1	*	Only if you allow it. You could, for example counter-act that effect with tarrifs. Or simply disallow businesses from doing it. You could still leave of course but then you wouldn't be able to participate in the economy of the other country. And that would be fine, good luck in your new home.

Well the cheapest combo we have with 4 breasts is $34, contains 24 wings, gizzards, and other offal, with a gallon of awful coleslaw, and 4 crusty biscuits.  Meanwhile the grocery store next door sells breasts for $2/ea.

Japan has been the largest importer of wood from SEA for decades. They were actually criticized a lot back then for the deforestation of rain forest in SEA.  However, Japan's demand for wood declined steadily over the years so I guess people just stopped mentioning them until now.

t1_dupoatj	1	*	>accidents are the third biggest killer of americans   Probably because we've got that whole cholera/polio/plague thing pretty much taken care of. Not much to die of anymore besides cancer, heart disease, and accidents.  >medical malpractice deaths in united states is 250 , 000 per year  Is that just prescription deaths?  I don't think so.

t1_duovtqb	1	*	I do know that in some emotionally charges discussions.. simple notes like this can help bring you back on talking points. It's easy to get lost when talking to parents about their dead kids... Or maybe he was given talking points. I don't know who's hand writing that is. 
t1_dup7tg1	1	*	Lol, as if anything like this is likely to be cheaper or easier to use than a regular pair of glasses. People patent ambitious stuff all the time, but a patent doesn't mean that the invention is practical.   But hey, keep up the fight against BIG GLASSES!

t1_durjmll	1	*	Dropping the atomic bombs prevented the death of potential millions of citizens and soldiers if the allies had to invade the island of Japan. No one argues that they weren't an act of atrocity and believing that it was a necessary evil isn't propaganda.
t1_dugo0bt	0	*	That's really not very relevant.
t1_duc0tdx	1	*	All this shit started with reputable news sources like CNN posting Twitter comments and asking questions Twitter users posed, giving the platform credibility. So it is a perfect target.  No news source should be directly relaying news from any social media site. You can use it as a starting point, but anything that makes it to board cast needs to be vetted and have a real person behind it.
t1_duuzvmp	1	*	How is this even mildly related? Due to an oversight, hes able to run. Its a total joke, and he doesnt plan on actually winning. How is that similar to Russia purposefully trolling the internet to create a culture divide between Americans? I dont even love John Oliver, but the connection between these two ideas is nonexistent.   Im glad America is so divided, if this is the retarded level of thought association that goes on in the heads of people like you. 
t1_duobyxm	1	*	Trump handed your personal information over to terrorists. Say goodbye to your precious tax return. Trump is in the pocket of Equifax. 143 million Americans are going to have their lives ruined, thanks to trump and his freakshow.

t1_duqtnee	1	*	Well, I imagine he pled out a bunch of superfluous charges and accepted his lightly-sentenced fate on conspiracy. Right? 
t1_dufe9kc	1	*	That doesn't solve anything. Lower the restrictions and people will find a way around it. You have to hit the roots of the problems, not the symptoms.  A truly intelligent public solves both problems. Campaign limits get circumvented.
t1_duy6aqu	1	*	I mean obviously the oil is going to get burned but I don't think the actual process of pulling it out of the ground is melting the caps. 
t1_dujl9bw	1	*	The enemies at the borders are currently the NATO countries fucking around in the Middle East and North Africa. Those countries are the biggest threat to EU at the moment.

t1_duw7irx	1	*	Unfortunately, we could all start biking everywhere tomorrow and it wouldn't matter when one massive cargo ship pollutes more than 50 million cars.

t1_duocvbm	1	*	Honestly, people who say stuff like that are completely disconnected from reality. I don't understand what's happened to the left in the last decade or so that has caused this sort of absurd lack of critical thinking. 
t1_dudcn2u	1	*	[It doesn't say that at all.](https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1035562/download)  It just says *these 13 people* were not known to be Russian when they first presented themselves to US citizens.

When she dies, her family can sweetly say, I guess God needed another angel.  Yeah, I don't understand it.  All the above are used and people think it makes sense and have no idea it is just grade A rationalization.

t1_duxnxhb	1	*	Or it's like recognizing the historical significance of the defining event of a century and realizing that this is a piece of that history and it should be preserved.  Wanting to erase everything that has a connection to anything bad from the past is a mindset that I'll never understand.

t1_duh20bc	1	*	Leaks are a sign of poor management
t1_duw7cxv	1	*	The problem is not the cold air over Europe. The problem is the warm air over the Arctic.
t1_duezn8d	0	*	Have you ever exercised in 40+ degrees C?  Once ambient temperature gets above body temperature it is dangerous.  FWIW, finished the last 50km of a 200km ride in 42oC. Not fun.
t1_dup12t1	1	*	Eh dont worry about it. People will only interpret what they want to get triggered about.
t1_dus95l7	1	*	I read the title and thought wow, I've always wondered how the zombie apocalypse begins...

t1_ducu8za	1	*	It continued past the Democratic primary.
t1_dufdkfn	1	*	That's what I'm hoping for. So many people saying a civil war is going to happen or whatever nonsense. I'd like to think Trump getting indicted is going to have the same effect as when The One Ring got dropped into Mount Doom. The Dark Tower fell and all the bad guys ran away never to be seen again.
t1_dubcox9	1	*	#the real life hack is in the comments#
t1_dufqsoq	1	*	An airplane can be old and still work just like new. Many militaries still use airframes from the 60-70s.   The only problem that arises is that yoy need more maintenance intervals.

t1_dutjx60	1	*	> I know I'm gonna get downvoted for this, but the constant all vaccinations are good rhetoric on reddit, as well as the anyone who raises concerns about vaccinations is a moron anti-vaxxer accusations, are so tiresome.  The drum needs to be beaten as loud and as long as possible, as long as there are dipshits who think they are not necessary or harmful.
t1_duurkac	1	*	I spent some time studying in a village in fiji this winter and the locals i talked to were telling me how the chinese have been coming in and destroying huge portions of reef for construction purposes then fishing the area out. A lot of the younger villagers i spoke to were getting ready to leave to either the main island or austrailia to study land management or law so they could try and do something about it

t1_duli0vc	1	*	Remember, everything that happens on twitter, happens on reddit too
t1_duglg6t	1	*	He is like a little kid with each insistence of innocence making himself look guiltier.   It's bizarre to see a grown man behave this way, surreal that it's a President.
t1_duyc2aw	0	*	This.   It's extremely hard to not take the eye for an eye approach. We in the US haven't taken this approach since basically our inception.
t1_dua6gr0	1	*	> But we're living in the most peaceful era like..literally ever.  That can still be true. It just means that there are a lot of kids in the places where conflicts happen. Their definitions include terrorism and have a pretty generous definition of war zone, though, so these stats aren't very useful.
t1_duxt7pe	1	*	Hell I hate him but it was true when he said it. We just don't wanna recognize shit hole countries so we don't have to think about them. 
t1_dulin11	1	*	That man has been on TV longer than any preacher alive. He's sold more books and had a brand more pervasive than any I can think of. $25 million? That's nothing. He'd be worth easily 20X that if he cared to.  Christ didn't say you had to be poor. Just don't make money your master. Billy could have made a billion. But he didn't. That should be telling enough. 
t1_dueqhfl	1	*	You're seeing correctly. All the left leaning stuff is a pr campaign to distract the people who would be b the most volatile. I can't believe it works. 
t1_dufdahr	1	*	Let's not lose sight of the fact that the FBI that he is attacking is lead by his choice for director after he fired the last one under the pretense of incompetence. Why hasn't anyone asked him why he chose a director that he thinks is so incompetent? 
t1_dusxz7k	1	*	China has been living under a dictatorship for a long time now, the difference is that they aren't giving the impression that they're a democracy and they're stuck with Xi for an indefinite amount of time now.
t1_duq7etx	1	*	Thanks .It is very sad that Trumps hates renewable energy :( though 
t1_dua6jjy	1	*	You should start including caring for your fellow americans into your patriotism. Your country is more than the country, it's the people as well. When one mans right to own a gun trumps a childs right to grow up there's something really wrong. 
t1_dut82c7	1	*	Well, people have started blaming a Deep state sort of group of witch hunting bibi, they do fit each other.
t1_dupqsie	1	*	Yes, you have to wxf6rk a lot in the Kindergarten.
t1_duurhlh	1	*	Talks with S. Korea are new, however. Kim just needed someone to slap him around a little. He's settling down. 
t1_dusrz57	1	*	If Trump does manage to make Mexico pay for a wall, Canada could use that set precedent and demand that the USA pay for a wall on their boarder. 
t1_dusrz5n	1	*	No, what tells you that is the fact that you're uneducated on the subject. If you got a couple hundred bucks to spare, why won't you go to Israel, see everything for yourself, and stop with the The jews are a bunch of nazis BS.
t1_dusug85	1	*	Seems like a nice setup for world war 3.

t1_duwtmq6	1	*	And their work environment is stressful as fuck too. The pay has to be high.
t1_duzaauo	0	*	You you are absolutely right about plastic being durable. It never breaks down. Ever.   It just breaks up into smaller and smaller pieces until all the fish and all the wild animals and everything that feeds on the fish and everything that feeds on the animals gets all those little plastic beads in it. Yummy.     
t1_dui9xmk	1	*	> They wealthy havent paid their fair shares in a long time... too many loopholes.  They hired the lobbyists. They donate to political campaigns.

t1_dujxdek	0	*	At least for whisky, not importing will raise the price of local whisky. It takes years to make and you can't just ramp up production to meet demands. And distilleries are very conservative when expanding their operation because things could change 8+ years down the line.
t1_duhuei0	0	*	Disgraceful yes, but don't point your anger at one person. If it wasn't this person, it would be the next.  This is the product of a very broken system that needs to be fixed.  Put your anger in that direction.
t1_dudjckc	1	*	It's not like we're a bunch of maniacs, slamming our heads into rocks. 99% don't even know what the fuck palm oil is, I don't even know what it is.
t1_dul7y4e	1	*	Could also probably include Maduro
t1_dupwrzw	1	*	He stayed on and communicated between Manafort and Trump after Manafort hit the eject button on the campaign, summer 2016'.  Everyone needs to wake up and Realize this all goes back to Trump.

t1_durw77y	0	*	It doesn't help either that anglophone teams keep on shouting HAAAARD
t1_dua46wm	1	*	That's a pretty lame attempt to apologise for school shootings to be honest. Doesn't the fact that you've got school kids bringing guns into school in the first place not concern you? probably not, but can you not even see how crazy that is as a very proposition.  
t1_duvnay6	1	*	Bali is as much a local tourist destination as it is an international one. People from all the other islands go to Bali for vacation. I think that the massive influx of people exacerbates an already inadequate waste management infrastructure and general apathy for trash issues from the locals. 
t1_dub8bfk	1	*	They're not - they want you to carry on killing eachother, arguing about it, and spending huge amounts of money on weapons that would otherwise be superfluous.
t1_dutihuo	0	*	I respectfully disagree.  Although Congress has significant issues, being a legislator takes years of building alliances, relationships, coalitions etc.   California has term limits for our legislative branch and its been a disaster for years.  The only thing that makes it somewhat treasonable now is the Dems have a super majority.  Which means no compromise is necessary, again something I dont approve of at all.  
t1_dubf87n	1	*	How do you know about my congressman Keith Rothfus? I didn't know he was on reddit, but 100% shill. And most likely bot as well.
t1_duulr2l	1	*	It's not the first time either. We don't usually sink their boats though, but a warning is always issued.  There are some species that are only born here, so that may be a reason. 
t1_dubaqrg	1	*	Because that will make him/her a martyr, that's a powerful thing to an oppressed people.
t1_dueadd0	1	*	technically  Even if Trump got on Twitter today and said he did in fact work with Russians to undermine the US elections, they'll say that it doesn't matter
t1_dumnri3	1	*	Damn.  How sweet would it've been if they achieved that ranking of 135 with a score of 16

t1_duwl9vp	1	*	> Hahaha ha! I wonder what he will say when the whole story of the 2016 election is known.  I told you so?
t1_dujoa7w	1	*	You got your talking point wrong, there, champ. You're supposed to say that he denied collusion, but that he never denied interference, so he's actual honest and good. Of course, that's also complete bullshit (he's explicitly said that he believes Putin when Putin tells him he didn't interfere, despite ironclad evidence to the contrary), but you could eat least stay on message.
t1_dujk89d	1	*	You're straight lying lol
t1_duwosii	1	*	Also, Quebec is one of the poorer provinces. Meaning we should not pay our doctors more than the Canadian average, as our economy is below the average.

t1_dubpgcc	1	*	Only Russian bots would disagree with the American second amendment and its toll on lives.
t1_duelu03	0	*	They would extradited to the US if the countries noticed, and they would then stand trial for the indictments.  What the indictments did was made it risky for these wealthy high level operators to travel to countries where they commonly vacation and do business, making their usefulness to Putin far less.  Possibly this results in Putin discarding them or potentially causes them to flip for safety. 
t1_dubd080	1	*	Cause the people didn't vote for that.
t1_duqb3uh	0	*	Someone speculated that the Chancellor is Gerhard Schrxf6der, now a chairman of Rosneft.

t1_duysaji	1	*	It means they can only ask about things that happened in the ~~10~~ ~~5~~ 2 prior minutes.
t1_dujmikr	1	*	The source is immaterial. Everything they just reported on is verifiable because everything he said is recorded. There is massive amounts of proof that this article is true. 
t1_duqgv76	1	*	I have the most, the best standards of any president, ever 
t1_dud7bxv	1	*	obviously, George Papadopoulos isn't american

t1_duntwke	1	*	The difference is Macron has competence in other fields than immigration reform, whereas that's about all National Front gives a shit about. It's better to have experienced people

t1_dud985z	0	*	http://topos.mx is a top notch rescue organization to donate to. They have helped rescue efforts all over the world.

t1_duotwfu	1	*	In addition to the plethora of very valid reasons why listening to China on issues regarding civil rights is insane
t1_duapvpa	1	*	First Russian reiteration of that joke Ive come across. 
t1_dukj2o8	1	*	The party doesn't care. They have years of staying in power ahead of them. What does the lion care about the opinions of sheep?
t1_dui9jhy	1	*	Even if some don't even if it's illegal the few that do help but as others have said the tax extra tax money will just go to dumb shit.
t1_dun9l9b	1	*	The IDF isn't present in Sydney airport.. They might have learned of this cell only after the first attempt was made.  The unit that discovered them was working from Israel, probably looking at their emails, social media, snapchat etc. and maybe even listening to their phone calls.  Sounds like the first attempt got foiled by the presence of security at the airport.
t1_dukof6p	1	*	Russia should be careful.  Even if the US degenerated to a level of weakness unforeseen, with the nuclear weapons the US has, .....

t1_dur1k57	1	*	From cat calling to simply regretting your own decisions. It's allllll rape. 
t1_duzj9pk	0	*	That's covered under Fair Use if you are doing it to not make money. The moment you do take someone's work without their permission and try to make money off of it is when you get sued for copyright infringement.
t1_dugl484	1	*	Their argument is that it's easier/better for the victim to be circumcised as a baby rather than years later when there will be more discomfort post-op.  While this sounds reasonable I don't think it makes up for the suffering and weeks/months of discomfort that babies have to endure when they are circumcised today.

t1_duew2cr	1	*	Eden *is* pretty good. 
t1_duuq2hf	0	*	Absolutely zero disrespect intended, but r/worldnews and r/nottheonion are both actual news sites.
t1_dufhpq5	1	*	The point that is being made is that it should be an individual choice. It is an irreversible damage inflicted upon a person, and no one should be allowed to make that choice, bar the person, or medical staff, for medical reasons (and even medical intervention requires consent).
t1_duj7mfi	1	*	if he stops he acknowledges how undemocratic his rule actually is. that would spell trouble for him
t1_duwdglu	1	*	It's like if the KGB and RT teamed up to make a newspaper. But hey, whatever gets clicks.

t1_dujh3ru	1	*	In Russia? They'll never run out.
t1_duwnenb	1	*	>The US would protect its industry by refusing to accept more Canadian physicians and we'd finally solve our physician shortage.    Eh?  We would welcome Canadian physicians with open arms, as long as they pass all licensing requirements.    We accept Canadian medical students to US residencies as long as they pass USLMEs/COMLEX.
t1_dudafsv	1	*	The Social Nyetwork 2
t1_duqa8uq	1	*	I don't see anyone claiming that Russia  is behind all of it. They clearly exploited existing issues in american society, but that doesn't detract from the seriousness of the problem.
t1_duq2038	1	*	i dont think so. people in the west have been brainwashed too believe anything these days.
t1_duqcrru	0	*	Its funny they managed it though, because as outsiders your Republican Party always seemed more anti Russia, prior to the orange one
t1_duv5l03	1	*	Politicians and lobbyists happen to be the highest ranking drug dealers in the world, sometimes in more ways that one...
t1_duv1omx	1	*	they arent' violently murdered because its a great strategy. its normalized. corruption is normal because it is lobbying.   
t1_duejjiq	1	*	> Being Jewish, Christian or otherwise is following a certain religion  Judaism is a tribal affiliation. Lots of Jews are atheists who don't do anything religious, but they're still Jews.  In prewar Germany most Jews were assimilated enough that you could call them both German and Jewish. In Poland that wasn't the case. Most Jews did not speak Polish as a first language and maintained their own separate media and schools.
t1_duv0q05	1	*	Trump himself is a sniff sniff sniff addict. 
t1_dul9b0q	1	*	I think they should be mandatory, there is are so many issues that come from lack if understanding.   This is totally different from teaching creationism as fact, it's about understanding cultures, and history.

t1_dugcj9w	0	*	> Trump - cut the fucking bullshit.  Thatll show em
t1_duv9eo8	0	*	Exactly, Israel selectively enforces the law against Arab people already living on this land. Then they say they're just enforcing the law, but they will never bulldoze these settlements or remove the settlers. Only Arab houses get bulldozed. 
t1_duj7vtq	0	*	Yeah, seeing the video and reading the transcript it makes it obvious that this article is propaganda and people either aren't reading or just not getting it. It's very blunt, I thought.  That said - I'm American.

t1_dua2m0c	0	*	You made a typographical error.

t1_duounjr	1	*	Just like Obama during brexit. 
t1_dukv3gj	1	*	It's why I take all these 'Russki kings of doping' articles with a huge grain of salt. Meldonium found on a curler, achtung achtung! Meanwhile in weightlifting, which is probably one of the most popular sports in Russia and which would certainly be one of the most heavily influenced by doping, they barely ever get any results?

t1_duss0lo	1	*	If I were Nieto, I'd make it my mission, every day, at 8 am, to make a statement that the Mexican people will not pay for Trump's wall.  Carve out a press release with the same statement, just change the date, and send it to every major news outlet every morning.
t1_dulq7zb	1	*	Sometimes you meet local politicians who are not. But then its scumbaggery all the way to the top.
t1_duq6cj4	1	*	Hey hold on a minute... What does weight have to do with that? I mean I'm with you Kangaroos are not endangered species but many others are and are pretty heavy like Tigers or Rhinos.
t1_dumirdo	1	*	Ouch.
t1_duc0r97	1	*	I don't think... this is how islands work.
t1_duz9x86	1	*	This isnt a pesticide issue, its a mental health issue.
t1_duos0cd	1	*	For people that hate their politicians, America is really good at keeping them...
t1_duk7gb9	0	*	The end solution would be the make mental healthcare (and all healthcare really) affordable and accessable, as well as changing as a society and culture so people don't feel the need to shoot their classmates.   However, seeing as neither of those are going to happen anytime in the next 100 years, nationwide comprehensive gun regulations are a decent secondary.
t1_duvtxcs	0	*	Does the same apply to guns?
t1_durj4si	0	*	http://johnrlott.blogspot.com.br/2012/08/some-notes-on-claims-about-australias.html?m=1  Your blessed hero probably led to more people being victimized than otherwise wouldn't have been had he kept his hands off the guns
t1_duat5xh	1	*	Did you know 54.1% of humans on earth live in urbanized area with no running water, sewage, formal economy, proper policing or proper healthcare? In my mind this stat is easily close to reality because it is true, in war zones there is less access to contraceptives, education and desire to care about when to have a child.    You should come to grips with the fact that if you're making over 36k USD a year you have more wealth than 99% of humans on earth. 
t1_dueujsv	1	*	We had a 7.2 yesterday in Mexico City Didnt feel shit and i was just waiting on the street eating my popcorn
t1_dumdywa	0	*	Good point blyat_bot_472c
t1_duo84ke	1	*	Yet still have school massacres.  But its not with guns so its okay.
t1_duizsfo	1	*	It's legitimately dangerous to be open as a homosexual even in the most progressive urban areas, in the more conservative rural areas it can be a death sentence. 
t1_dudsq0h	1	*	Some things do cost a lot of money when you factor in r&d, marketing, manufacturing, and what not. 
t1_dun12fl	1	*	Ringling Bros. shutdown.  We can shutdown this circus too.   ^^^^Please ^^^^send ^^^^thoughts ^^^^and ^^^^prayers.
t1_duwz97z	1	*	For real. I wouldnt stand for this shit in my country, but China isnt my country!
t1_durs15l	1	*	I don't see anyone crying about Hillary losing. I do see a lot of people crying about having people in charge whose only qualifications are inherited money and in case of Ivanka a pretty face and a pair of tits. 
t1_duknw6h	1	*	Anti-vaxxers needs to be packed and shipped off to a freaking isolation camp so they can live their life happy, and we can live our life safely.
t1_dufik6z	1	*	Compare Belarus (pro-Russian govt) with Ukraine (pro-Western govt). People are much happier in Belarus than in Ukraine.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Happiness_Report 
t1_dugrz0l	0	*	Ya man everything in this world is orchestrated by the lizard people who live in the clouds. 
t1_duf7stu	1	*	And then immediately follows it up with this:  I get a lot of fat wood pigeons jumping up and down on my chimney and I first of all thought the noise was them but they must have put on a heck a lot of weight to make the house shake
t1_duh7nye	1	*	Here's a [list](https://www.reddit.com/r/canada/comments/7uk2mp/a_list_of_companies_i_no_longer_support_glad_im/) from another post in r/canada.
t1_duj7h6x	1	*	If Russian culture does not accept gays and if the Russians dont accept gays, why should it matter to non-Russians if theyre homophobic or not? Why try to impose your morals upon theirs.
t1_dulq5d4	1	*	Do the voices ever ask you to do things?
t1_duef8g7	1	*	What the fuck is Andorra's problem?
t1_dur2xoo	1	*	Does Norway help pay for America's seed vaults? 
t1_duji56f	0	*	I don't know, as a history buff I think it is weird to think that the Germans don't have the scariest tanks on the battlefield.   Make way puny American tanks, make way
t1_duy76ol	0	*	As with Hitler and the Jews, its more of a way to unite a majority under one banner. Give them a scape-goat and something to hate and they wont focus so much on the shit youre really doing. Youd be surprised how much hate unites people. 
t1_duxv5s3	1	*	Yeah, the stonings would probably go much quicker.
t1_duow3p6	1	*	We're living on the dark timeline
t1_dupqs5z	1	*	Subs like r/worldnews are heralding the arrival. This sub has really gone to shit with the amount of astro-turfing and the_donald brigading. 
t1_duxbe6u	1	*	Sure they like taxes, when youre paying it to them. 
t1_duz8lea	1	*	> the weather  Climate.  Giant body of water rapidly warming up is not weather.
t1_dunt21r	1	*	why don't you tell us all about it? Is St. Petersburg cold this time of year?
t1_dueee56	1	*	That's hard to do when the message *is* just hollow Buzzfeed fodder.
t1_dumnio1	1	*	Cafeteia workers? IT? Jennifer? The possibilities are endless
t1_dug7xl3	1	*	Russia has been utilizing state-sponsored doping for decades. Its safe to assume a huge of athletes do it under pressure from the Kremlin as well as feeling that they need the edge they think it might give. Watch the recent documentary on Netflix called Icarus. It's all about Russia and Putin's sordid history of doping their athletes. 
t1_dud3aqz	1	*	The problem is our own government is so bought and unresponsive to regular people that they've lost trust of many Americans no matter the side. Maybe if half the country didn't think voting was a waste of time we wouldn't have to worry about #hashtag campaigns. 
t1_duth6sl	1	*	Easier to blame others 
t1_duf80oz	0	*	Canada is still functionally a constitutional monarchy for over a hundred years.
t1_duyk2do	1	*	I think theres so much itll end up being at least a 2 movie series. 
t1_duyezdf	0	*	Pretty much. But also when your adversaries are going to take advantage of the bozo in the White House, what choice do you have but to follow along? 
t1_duk4zep	1	*	Won't take long before he claims he has planted them.
t1_dulwcdn	1	*	....it's been reported in the news, you're reading the article
t1_dukgn12	1	*	Came for this was not dissatisfied 
t1_duxkt1s	0	*	Didn't work out to well with the Bay of Pigs. Now imagine a larger scale. 
t1_duyn2go	1	*	Youd be surprised, its grown legs of its own. At this point since sanctions will only get harder on Russia, Russias job is done now, they are probably focusing on their next job with minimal effort put towards just keeping track of this situation to make sure evidence doesnt lead back to the State.
t1_duw473g	1	*	See [Dr. Jennifer Francis on Arctic Amplification, it's effect on the Jet Stream and hence it's effect on the weather.](https://youtu.be/gAiA-_iQjdU) 
t1_durq0rc	1	*	I'd like to think this but it sure the fuck didn't work with the boomers.
t1_dup6rzi	1	*	By being invited by the embassy to do so:  She told reporters that Russian and Argentine police had decided to mount a sting operation after the Russian ambassador informed them of the drugs find in December 2016.
t1_dupo7hz	1	*	Ireland over paid. A portion of Ireland's money went to correcting German financial mistakes(among others) and keeping the Euro from collapsing. Ireland and others continue to suffer from some of the affects of austerity measures pushed by Germany, while Germany itself is doing rather well economically.   After the whole Brexit thing Euroscepticism has dipped significantly, but I feel a healthy dose of Euroscepticism is needed.  
t1_duvtymu	1	*	One issue is that yes the globe is warming, but weve only been keeping records there since mid last century. Freak winters occur, Galveston Bay has frozen over numerous times in the 1800s. 
t1_duqdjpl	1	*	> Investigate all the dark Pac money while you're at it. Campaign finance laws are a joke and all these fuckers are accepting money from everywhere. Russia isn't the only country funneling money into our elections.   This.  
t1_duxbpl6	1	*	> But if a person is a terrorist, meaning they've committed an act, wouldn't they likely be dead or in prison (making taking their kids away rather superfluous)?  Sounds like extra BS legislation to be misused, I thought measures already exist to protect children.
t1_dufs7hw	0	*	The argument that it's the safest relies on accidents per distance travelled. Since planes travel so far, they appear very safe.  However if you look instead at accidents per trip, they are not nearly as safe.
t1_dusu50l	0	*	Next thing Trump impregnates Kim
t1_duqbjna	1	*	The-nowsa-whatsit? The who-lins?
t1_duxx4os	1	*	It doesn't have to make sense.
t1_duix28r	1	*	>It literally doesn't fucking matter.  ... to you. It doesn't matter, to *you*,  If you don't want a cock infection, here's a novel idea: wash your dick
t1_durcncm	0	*	waaaaaaa we speared babies for fun and big bully America dropped a nuke on us! Waaaaaaa 
t1_dujxhwc	1	*	r/trumpcriticizestrump
t1_duwbbyp	0	*	It IS the mob
t1_duw9bvi	0	*	Yeah, wait until you have a wife and kids, tough guy. I'm sure your principles will do just fine against some thug with a .45 pressed against your skull.
t1_duqvjdu	1	*	Broke ass fools in America were so tired of the coastal elites fucking them they got Trumped wayyyyy worst and they arent smart enough to know it. 
t1_duucnbh	1	*	Until you need more coffee.
t1_dunbt0m	1	*	And many follow up questions
t1_dug8mxr	1	*	Everyone knows Bibi made the Iranians do it with his Jewish mind control technique. /s
t1_duep2im	1	*	Cool
t1_duq52yw	1	*	Give it to refugees as is tradition here since 2015.  Believe me, actual German citizens haven't seen any of that surplus yet. They're just getting poorer.
t1_dubrnu4	1	*	I doubt armed civilians are a threat anymore. Just take them out with drones, missiles, etc. On the other hand, having large amounts of guns within the US makes it easier for gun violence, mass shootings, and civil wars to occur.
t1_duc28q7	0	*	My god :( I have been avoiding buying anything with palm oil for years now for this exact reason. I mention it to people pretty often...it may seem small but it can have an impact if we all make this small change. For instance, Girl Scout cookies used to contain palm oil until two scouts found out about the forest destruction and orangutans, petitioned to change it and were successful! We can make a difference. 
t1_duhvwff	0	*	You've got a good point, but at the end it's kind of a moot point, isn't it?
t1_duqad81	0	*	Am I allowed to think my fellow, pro-NRA Americans are shitty and also blame Russia for influencing our election?
t1_dur1i1l	1	*	All they have to do is air drop a few thousand 64 packs of Crayola Crayons (fuck roseart), and you'd render the USMC useless. Sure, you'd have some Army guys, and greenside Navy, but the Marines would be done for awhile. 
t1_duni2sd	1	*	I think we are looking for a decade or more of this before it waves to the left. 
t1_dujoeyz	1	*	Are interfere and meddle not synonyms in this context?   If you say someone didn't interfere, aren't you also saying they did not meddle? 
t1_duhswqy	1	*	wow, imagine if you actually read the article.  don't, it will reveal too much to you, you may be overwhelmed.
t1_duo5lo4	1	*	I like the last one. Because it means that if the nation they live in ever decided to run itself by killing them, then they would be fine with it. 
t1_duzk9xa	0	*	nope this is correct caption. Image captions are used for blind people's screen readers, not for your entertainment.
t1_dui31f5	1	*	Thats tribalism, and its extent went far beyond religion.
t1_dunecx0	1	*	Well it had better be fake news, because otherwise the Russian involvement kind of delegitimizes the US election. That would be pretty shitty
t1_duh0za3	1	*	It's an admission that _this_ president has no power, and that the people who are really running the country are trying to avoid a constitutional crisis.  
t1_duapnzd	1	*	Depressing though, that that works. 
t1_dunmx04	0	*	Obviously we are not the Philippines are some 3rd world nation with a crumbling democracy, but between the War on Drugs, corporate lobbyists, gerrymandering, etc. we have some serious issues.   Its not so much as amendment rights as it is horrific policies that screw over so many Americans and turn our democracy into an oligarchy
t1_duxd2ht	1	*	And I think most people would agree that was bad right? So what you meant to say was this story about Russia moving coke internationally is bad, but got distracted by another story in the past?   It would be like when news first came out about Hitler committing genocide, and someone responds that the US killed off most of the Native Americans when they colonized. But then again we are in the time of whataboutism that helps bad actors justify their actions.
t1_dut0omo	0	*	Just go tear down their shitty wall. 
t1_duoqkd9	1	*	Its all about reading the headline and adapting the story to what you believe. After electing that clown Americans should learn to read and inform themselves 
t1_ducse2f	1	*	How is the number of tweets relevant?  You don't see every single tweet made on twitter.  You see what you expose yourself to.  You see what is related to your interests.  You see what is retweeted by who you follow.
t1_dubt32r	1	*	Your comment deserves so many more likes, that's the most I've learned all day
t1_duu7900	1	*	You know that won't ever happen.
t1_duqhlol	1	*	This is a big reason why I wanted him in office. He's someone that we can garner enough support to impeach and bring attention to the amount of shit that's in the crockpot.
t1_dut2ncy	1	*	Are you a Khan? Don't lie
t1_dub906i	1	*	Cold war isn't over it just chilled.
t1_dubrqxz	1	*	It's propaganda, it's not real.
t1_duv1y1l	1	*	I know I tend toward hyperbole but I don't think Trump thinks murder is a problem. He's raised to think the world is divided between killers and losers, if you die it was because you allowed it to happen: thus you deserve it.
t1_duv29xk	0	*	Due to drugs being illegal. I think I see an obvious solution.
t1_dujkmub	1	*	Im convinced this admin is the political equivalent of a smash and grab. Move in, break shit, profit for years while the next admin tries to fix things.  
t1_dunrqk6	0	*	Its always the same guy...
t1_duiqoeu	1	*	Don't be a karma whore.
t1_duxr802	0	*	Seriously? I've been on that reddit for a while now and I never get that feeling of it being a right oriented sub. I always get more of a socialist feeling.
t1_duphd1x	1	*	I'm fine with Germany having a military. They're a pretty responsible and moral nation now. 
t1_dui0phm	0	*	I think it's a bit hypocritical to suggest they need to abandon their beliefs when you have a lot of people in the developed world that have laws protecting their own brand of old religions.  Education is needed, though, and attempts have to be made to turn their beliefs away from violent practices.
t1_duqookd	1	*	From your lips to Trump's ears, brother.
t1_dulpvr7	1	*	Streets ahead!
t1_duo9lmh	1	*	No guarantee it wont slide back.
t1_dumcbpf	1	*	by a very tiny margin. 
t1_dumm4vx	0	*	Everyone should be required to carry a gun that holds a single bullet. That way no one can do too much damage, but when enough people are around, its a proper deterrent for someone to not shoot another person. 
t1_duvdsg9	1	*	pretty sure the average Chinese urbanite doesn't give a shit about jaguar fangs. No citation tho.
t1_dub2m1k	1	*	They already have Finland
t1_dupg8ia	1	*	Yeah it's good that Germany remains with an extremely limited military, for obvious reasons. It actually works out quite well for them as they get all the benefits from NATO (with an emphasis on the USA) protection without any of the budgetery costs.
t1_duskjj7	1	*	But they aren't.
