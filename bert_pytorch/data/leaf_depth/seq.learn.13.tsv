t1_dtd1b87	0	*	Boeing isn't doing the same thing.  You are lying about boeing.  That proves you are anti-boeing.  You don't care about facts.
t1_dtcrrvd	1	*	That's a very good point, and makes me rather curious about their solution to it.
t1_duic9i3	1	*	No, it was obvious as it was with Trump.
t1_duo4bmv	0	*	I understand that the term is misused. I'm simply saying that we should endeavour to use language correctly. I don't see why that should be particularly contentious.
t1_dunsqi8	1	*	Fair. I should be at the gym. But I think that applies to both of us :)
t1_duaq5hn	0	*	> Adding another wrong thing to your pile of things you get wrong won't hurt too much.  Ummm okay?
t1_duavtxs	1	*	Oh, I agree it's complicated.  That's why I dislike all the arguments that people have shorter lives because they have less money to buy good food, health care, etc.  
t1_dua9hd2	1	*	Well, it's census data so there's nothing more reliable than it. Obviously, people don't have genetic testing when filling in their census form to confirm they belong to a certain ethnicity or race.
t1_dtle9o5	0	*	I misunderstood.  I'm pretty sure we agree.
t1_dtovvqx	1	*	You're still replying... Lol 
t1_dtlocfc	0	*	What did he do?  Call the cops?
t1_dtlmisy	1	*	Yep, 100% agreed.
t1_dtlslmq	0	*	Full to 3/4 is 25% reduction.  3/4 to 1/2 is a 33% reduction.  You want to try to come down in similar % reductions.  
t1_dtlvgw6	1	*	It's actually pretty common. Google Ultra Rapid Detoxification
t1_dtlkpha	1	*	Yep. Benzo withdrawal (along with *high octane* alcohol detox, delerium tremens style) is just about the only withdrawal that can actually kill you.
t1_dtlqnuq	0	*	But like, why cant they taper down even more? Smaller and smaller over longer periods of time? 
t1_dubudfx	0	*	Worms carry bacteria that sure the fuck are unless you are prepared to get sick on the off chance some of them survive, which happens 
t1_ducgv6l	0	*	Worms have poop in them, though. You can't cook poop.
t1_ducdi2k	0	*	That person didn't ask for proof originally. They just said, Nope
t1_dubtc8y	0	*	You can get heartworms, tapeworms, pinworms, whipworms, hookworms - parasitic worms. They live in things. Especially things without regular checkups, modern medicine, and a sterilized food supply.
t1_dubszjp	0	*	The aliens told me
t1_duc6399	1	*	Ty, much appreciated
t1_dv1ew33	1	*	I forgot that the Russians have secret invisible planes and trains that can go from Russia to Spain without being noticed by anyone.
t1_dtny2l9	1	*	> Children dont have a say in getting vaccinations either  The health authorities established by law say they are beneficial, whereas they dont say that non therapeutic circumcision is. 
t1_dspiubu	0	*	Our views are exposed in a reasonable way with enough things to chew. Our opposition is clear and shows that things are not trivial and there are opinions to be expressed. Have a nice day. 
t1_dt2r16b	0	*	> Just let this be a lesson to not push such stupid conspiracy theories before actually researching it for yourself. You won't look like such a moron in the end.  Temper, temper!
t1_dsb3pql	0	*	 > united states is not perfect but its the closest thing we have to a benevolent superpower.  lmao 
t1_dufl5nz	0	*	Apologies for the undignified way I conducted this discussion.
t1_dujqeym	0	*	....I think you're ignoring nukes deliberately now.
t1_dsvh56b	1	*	I kind of agree with you. I believe that Judaism has a stronger claim. But I don't believe that Israel equates to Judaism.
t1_dsvz3a3	0	*	Huh? You dont trust pew polls for example? Arabs say they hate Jews, but you dont believe them?  Im not sure what polls of Germans have to do with it. 
t1_dsvrvav	1	*	> Yes the law that they drafted.   No. The law drafted under the UN international agreement.   You can learn more here:  http://www.unhcr.org/1951-refugee-convention.html
t1_ds325xd	0	*	A Hellfire missile has a five mile range, **name one** currently used anti air missile with a shorter range.  Are all the targets we're planning to hit within five miles of the border?
t1_ds34h8l	0	*	U think china doesnt have shorter range nuclear missiles?   Tell me would u rather be in the range of a few dozen nukes or over 300? 
t1_dsgshbc	0	*	So basically anyone with an old car should stop driving it right?
t1_dsa9wgx	1	*	Huh, that's odd.
t1_ds954ux	0	*	well, that's a plus at least
t1_dsa0s5o	1	*	Yeah their first gen of mice had a thumb wheel. RAT 3, 5, 7, 9, MMO7 and maybe a few others
t1_ds925jd	1	*	I think ive found the root of the matter
t1_ds9c90a	1	*	Maybe Muskateer? Or is it too cute? 
t1_ds9al33	1	*	cringe af bro!
t1_du39zww	0	*	US has no current conflict with China except now you have created one in your mind because you have a trade deficit with them. Go fix that on your own rather than dragging other countries into it. 
t1_du3c9nm	0	*	You underestimate China's strength. Forget the Indian one, I wouldn't expect even the American government to be able to stand up to China without support.
t1_dset33b	0	*	If it costs xa3100 to feed a North Korean citizen for a year and someone else pays it that's potentially millions that can instead be put into funding their military program.
t1_dv1t5z6	1	*	All i suggested was that you read the different sides to the story, you think that is a bullshit attitude to have?  It is far, far more complex than that my friend.
t1_dv22dpz	1	*	*screams internally*
t1_dsq8ch7	0	*	Memory doesn't work that way, and I'm sure you know that already. Stop trying to defend this.
t1_dthvwjj	0	*	No, it's alternative facts made up to brainwash people like you. Try doing some research.
t1_dunckl6	0	*	Terrorism is wholly unrelated to teenagers and guns.  Stop trying to deflect. Find this mythical 80-man knife spree.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_massacres_in_Great_Britain  Where is it?
t1_duf8rua	1	*	Feral cat hunting should be encouraged.
t1_dugbpx5	1	*	Well its always been Woolies here for as long as Ive been alive (close to 40 years). I didnt even know it was called something different in a couple of states until recently!
t1_dsf0qsu	0	*	Yeah I've read it and I think it's biased. Have you read it? And if you have aren't you just getting your opinion from others? 
t1_dstfjya	0	*	Enjoy the report for harassment. This redditor lied, and he was called out for exploiting people's ignorance of the Arabic language. 
t1_dsteojv	1	*	Don't bother, this guy has a hard-on against Israel, possibly anti-Semitic. I've seen him in every thread about Israel, bashing them in every way possible even when they didn't do anything wrong. 
t1_dstvzpm	1	*	They were already living there
t1_ds2rnl1	1	*	I know. I love it! The minute he realized that he was talking to a real American he shied away. 
t1_dtfderj	0	*	lol, you keep telling yourself that kid
t1_dutp8ky	1	*	Okay, well that changes a lot. We need to be vigilant about using terms like in error or in their own words so that we dont allow them to succeed in their linguistic initiatives. 
t1_duuij2y	1	*	That is a very dangerous line of thinking. If we euthanize those that we deem a net loss to society, where does it end? The disabled, the elderly, the unmotivated, undesirables?
t1_duui3r2	1	*	Again, the vast majority of christians know this. 
t1_dutmfvo	1	*	This is some heavy ass r/justneckbeardthings and r/iamverysmart type shit right here.  If you dont have anything of actual value to contribute to the conversation, why are you here?
t1_dutmvxl	1	*	Are you asking about the vaccine? Because varicella refers to the virus, and chicken pox refers to the disease. But no, the vaccine wouldn't be harmful, just pointless.
t1_duxko7s	1	*	Sure thing. Nice tinfoil hat. 
t1_dutlr9d	1	*	after. millions? I didn't say i agreed with his actions but i think he made them with America's best interest in mind.
t1_dutsqep	1	*	You get money to pay for food and rent while studying in most eu countries, so that's not a worry
t1_duts5lg	0	*	You're ridiculous.  Look at how you responded to my message.
t1_duupytn	1	*	Yeah but the guy was a bit of a cunt. Omg someone got something wrong, better try and crush their self esteem. I'd rather be you mate.
t1_duu85ty	1	*	Oh my god hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaga
t1_dutpv5o	0	*	I don't care what the medical community recommends.  Compulsory vaccinations are a terrible idea. 
t1_duu81hk	0	*	Yeah it was rare to die from polio, children were just paralyzed for life. No big deal.
t1_duu0qo0	0	*	Fuck up your own health, you don't own a kid you just raise him/her, and you're obviously too much of a moron to have any.
t1_duuq11n	1	*	Noooh, I ment smallpox... Im either an idiot or English language really do suck.
t1_dutp5v5	0	*	Explaining it as in acting like its a real thing and not just right wing doublespeak. 
t1_duuh254	0	*	> . You went through my post history digging for ammunition.  well, don't post shit on the internet then.
t1_dutxen0	1	*	Yeah lol. Whoops
t1_dv4ibzv	0	*	Yes, that's exactly how pathetic you are. One day you'll turn 14 and realize how embarrassing your stupidity is.
t1_dv52plj	0	*	Phone side, both as a regular agent and as a senior agent/Tier 2/supervisor. I'm considering moving to full on IT support though.
t1_dv4liwb	0	*	This was back in 2006ish.  So I didn't bother looking into VPN options at the time.
t1_dv4cu9t	1	*	On fttn. I am one of the lucky ones on fttp, and it rocks. My plan is 50/25 and I normally get about 45/20. This is what the NBN should have been. Fuck the LNP.
t1_dv4bdl6	1	*	Wtf 0.8 mbps here
t1_dv4ty7o	1	*	Of course they did... They're *why* so many people started defaulting.
t1_ds5dlzj	0	*	Negotiating salary is up to each employee individually. If someone doesnt ask for as much money, they wont get as much money.  If they dont like that, they can unionize.
t1_ds5dtcz	0	*	Yes, but men and women are not negotiating salary equally well.
t1_ds5eo3y	0	*	> thats textbook discrimination  It's actually more of a disparate impact. Which is a related thing, but not quite discrimination.
t1_ds5ichq	0	*	Dont presume to know other peoples reasons for not sharing their personal information with you. It makes you sound stupid.
t1_ds5egjw	0	*	So what makes #3 discrimination but #4 not? Why would it be okay to screw Tom out of a raise but not Sally?
t1_ds5imn9	1	*	Everything is private information unless it's known. 
t1_ds5huuu	0	*	So you don't to be a legal requirement, you want it to be a company requirement.  Got it.
t1_ds5doh2	0	*	You try that in your own company and see what happens to your top talent.

t1_ds68j3z	0	*	Does there have to be an effect? People would know it, and I don't want them to know it, what more of an effect does it need to have?
t1_dum5xhu	1	*	Wut?
t1_dtq69i6	0	*	So in america lying and defrauding the government is the norm? Sounds just about right
t1_dtoasdm	0	*	The economy =\= the stock market =\= job creation.  No, I didnt make any such claim.  I posited that the trends are not specifically related to the presidents whose term they happened in.
t1_dtoncfy	1	*	Ikr?
t1_dtozw6l	0	*	There is no plan to keep privatized energy cheap. And if there was, it wouldn't be a conservative idea, would it. It would be something cooked up by the NDP and it **wouldn't work.**.
t1_dto0uec	0	*	Yeah, when you have an argument that can be applied to a population, and not just an individual, get back to me.
t1_dto3tl6	1	*	The problem with people like you is that you believe the most retarded possible course of action is legitimate because of the The will of the people.
t1_dto131z	0	*	The Obama DOJ lied by omission to the FISA court to obtain a warrant to spy on a private citizen. Steele has been proven to be discredited entirely as a partisan hack. Tick tock....
t1_dtof3rj	0	*	It had already been decided to be made legal. 
t1_dtod44w	1	*	I'm from Detroit so I heard Beanie and Toque. Went to university in Kentucky and people down there call them toboggans. I'm like... GUYS THAT'S A SLED. 
t1_dto86l8	0	*	Beany = 2 syllables  Toque = 1 syllable  Everyone should just call them toques, it would save the world so much time by not wasting it on an extra syllable.
t1_dto5xdh	0	*	Why do you hate the global poor?
t1_dto3b39	0	*	Ok, citations to laws and penalties for leaks in pipelines in Canada then.   Cause they sure as fuck do not exist in the US.
t1_dtp1ssf	0	*	Ok... That's pretty ignorant. Why would you be proud of that?  No, we like you ignorant.
t1_dto46kb	1	*	they call sleds double-doubles
t1_dto3dyy	0	*	I'll make it easier for you. Canada owes the US 12 billion. So yeah, I'd say that's a never. 
t1_dto1wbl	1	*	And if he makes a tidy profit off all that? All the better! Pay. To. Play.
t1_dtpvng9	1	*	How much money do you have under management? 
t1_dtp6gjw	0	*	Its no problem.   Also i didnt know that the US was in such a bad place on the global stage. You think Trumps policy will make it better/worse? 
t1_dtoljak	1	*	But the pronoun thing is a cancer to our society 
t1_dtqf1ti	0	*	Liar, coward, liar coward. All he'll ever be
t1_dto6c1f	0	*	Oh look at that.  The sober analysis comes out when the Dow sees the worst loss in 2 years, but when it was continuing an eight year bull market, its all Trump.  You might be biased.
t1_dumb8d7	1	*	sry
t1_dum11da	0	*	you poor soul, i feel so bad for you.
t1_dum92xe	0	*	hello botty? 
t1_dum840g	1	*	it was a good guess though, certainly a better one that he has about Russia. and one that he didn't dispute.
t1_dum8iiy	1	*	> Right, which is what I said.  Yes, I noticed the lack of cohesiveness between your posts. Maybe you should take some time off, try to figure yourself out, then get back to us, eh?
t1_dum0rrn	0	*	hey joe, from your comments i definitely know more about you than you know about Russia.
t1_dum8gz5	0	*	no, that's because you are on reddit.
t1_du13lx9	1	*	Yeah, funny innit? We'll destroy an entire country because they looked at us funny, but another one equally shit who treats us nice will get off scot-free despite having the exact same morals.
t1_du018h6	1	*	Not even progress, repair infrastructure that already exists. Forget the progress, we still need to fix what we already built.
t1_dtzxekt	0	*	>The vast majority of military money goes to tech investment. The high tech job losses would be insane and cause a catastrophe.  Sounds like too big to fail government welfare to me. 
t1_dtzxrss	1	*	It is what it is.

t1_durbqx7	0	*	Then you need to read a bit more. 
t1_durjgyr	1	*	Wet willys will not be tolerated.
t1_durbufd	0	*	Andrew Jackson. I have heard that native American casinos won't even take twenties because they have his face on it. Or so my one-eight Choctaw friend tells me.
t1_durcsj9	1	*	Oh no it's very varied. In Alaska they have to learn about bear safety in elementary school. Every state handles it's own education system, but there's some national standards and stuff like that.
t1_durogc0	0	*	Dresden was bad, too. That was not necessary. 
t1_durq5jk	0	*	Oh, right! Forgive my ignorance then. I thought they were the same.
t1_durrns8	1	*	Nor did I say that.
t1_durzy1f	0	*	Yeah all that's been covered.  Why bother bringing up Japan's war crimes at all?
t1_durdl7e	1	*	Ah well then TILooked like an idiot
t1_durlnhs	1	*	There is no appeasing you. Have a good day.
t1_durtq9s	0	*	the idea was if the leader wont surrender so be it, the people will get the nuke and it worked
t1_durbw76	0	*	You are wrong.
t1_durlgd1	0	*	i wouldent defend war crimes its abhorrent 
t1_durc936	0	*	Oh really?  I assume that was at one of the conferences, rather than a speech?
t1_durb26s	1	*	The majority are fake, they're not from Syria and Iraq, rather Northern Africa, and it was targeting of Northern Africans that prevented a repeat of the massive sexual assaults that happened on NYE. 
t1_dur9uzo	1	*	Thank you. I do my best.  Yours too.
t1_dut5gy1	0	*	You pulled that out of that post?
t1_durvaur	1	*	If you say so.
t1_duyxnad	0	*	I'm going to leave you to you're lack of grasp 
t1_duw153k	1	*	The other person said far right wing or the article they linked said such.
t1_dus48kw	0	*	The US loaned them all those ships and the Soviet's had shit for experience in building modern (for the time period) amphibious warfare craft and their shipbuilding capacity during WWII was useless.
t1_duri94c	0	*	Yes, the fact that most of them aren't from Syria. 
t1_durqovz	0	*	It's almost as if you don't have anything of substance to back up your claim

t1_durur4z	0	*	I dunno, I feel pretty confident that it would be hard to convince me to play bayonet baseball with infants. 
t1_dsfgsv1	0	*	All I'm doing is pushing back on the automatic assumption that there was a nefarious motive behind this move.
t1_dsudjkb	0	*	I am sorry you don't want to discuss the issues, but I think you are a good American. 
t1_dsuo7xj	0	*	Which part do you want to discuss with me? 
t1_dtbgs2e	0	*	> You offered murder as an argument against legal marijuana. Strawman  No, I asked him his position on extending his logic to murder. I never argued against that position.
t1_dtbhy5r	1	*	More like power = money * time.
t1_dtbl9y4	0	*	What a stupid and detached comment. Why don't you gun down the elementary school to steal the 4th graders' penny jar then? It makes business sense after all. 
t1_dstoqgw	1	*	Haha, and youre gonna be the judge. 
t1_dt1a3lq	1	*	LOL, yes I realize that 20% of the people who live in Israel are actually indigenous.  
t1_dthiulu	0	*	Lol run away? You said you were done talking. 
t1_dthptou	0	*	So which is it, fake partisan Hackett, or dangerous?
t1_dtgzid6	0	*	I never said that about Carter, please keep track of usernames.  And Joe Rogan willingly gives a voice to deluded racist psychopaths (example: Alex Jones) so Joe Rogan can kiss my ass.

t1_dtic07h	0	*	I haven't either. If you want to go to Trump Grill and you're buying, I'll have lunch and try the bowl with you.
t1_dtfc2t1	1	*	Point proven.  Thanks.
t1_du8zyd5	1	*	I stated above I was also against receiving an organ. I'm not normally selfish but this is one thing I stand by
t1_du9fj6p	0	*	What are the plot holes? You saying it is far easier not to kill is the plot hole. Not everyone is rational.
t1_du8le4i	1	*	Well at least you're not a CrossFit Vegan Atheist
t1_du8mf8o	0	*	The person I replied to asked the need to keep a kidney after death. I agree with your other points. 
t1_duaoqqg	0	*	*that uses lead pipes

t1_du9fh3r	1	*	Wow how did you get that from the conversation??
t1_du947i3	0	*	You have the option to opt-out, if you decide to that's your choice, nobody is forcing you to do so. And nobody is forcing you to remain opt-in. 
t1_du8xk7g	0	*	> they had a right to have sex  Lol they didn't?
t1_du8s2k2	1	*	I'm not talking about feelings or beliefs but legality. 
t1_du8yzcv	0	*	You had to pay it every time you renewed your license. Do you not realize that some people can't actually spare a dollar for something not necessary? 
t1_du95rej	1	*	It's ironic because so many atheist have become exactly what they hate. 
t1_du8tjv8	0	*	Nah, it's a huge difference, in one case you are taking a life to save another, in the other case you are saving a life with no negative repercussions.  To say they are even similar is just wrong. 
t1_duamlhz	0	*	No thank you, nobody owes me anything. If I want to donate its out of the goodness of my heart- its not a business transaction - I dont expect anything in return.  
t1_duk6pir	1	*	Yeah I'm honestly really OK with having a system that would reward organ donors with higher chances of receiving a donation. 
t1_du8yoye	1	*	she* but yes, thank you for getting the joke U0001f602
t1_du93eva	1	*	Weird... it showed up right in the preview. Thanks for saying something.
t1_du8jdqv	1	*	it's supposed to be a trap for your family, not for the surgeon removing your organs...
t1_du9n9xl	0	*	If the government automatically registers you for organ donation, is it really a choice?  It's certainly a lot more complicated than you think.
t1_duablgv	1	*	Yes, they weren't advanced as us, but you're implying they deserved it because of that fact. And it's just the attitude of the school yard bully that grinds me gears
t1_duam9eg	1	*	>Fuck other people  >Fuck saving lives  >I want my organs to be wasted and just rot in the ground  Yeah pretty cunty 
t1_dua1r8g	0	*	Let me type it out in simple terms for you:  *If a person absolutely does not want to donate organs, they will find the time to opt-out.*
t1_du8id35	1	*	*sigh* here in the US we can only dream of such an outcome
t1_duau239	0	*	That's great you want rapists to get your organs. Please hurry and give them to them
t1_du91v3r	0	*	That cult following was underestimated and was able to elect Donald J. Trump into office. You only strengthened my point. Thank you.
t1_du8fywn	0	*	Yes please. Since 99.99% of the people here do not have guns they shouldn't be as trigger happy. 
t1_dubr62e	0	*	Interesting. And what is the aim of your revolution? 
t1_du8nq65	0	*	> abortions kill human babies  Oh, boy. You're one of *those*. Calling an embryo or a fetus a baby is like calling a chicken egg a hen. It's not accurate.
t1_dt316ga	0	*	A victim brought it up, not me. The pope's position is if they don't have video tape he's innocent. You support him.  I'll never understand catholics.
t1_dtpjzww	0	*	Well of course the people who are having their malfeasance exposed say it's all lies. Do you trust Trump when he say he's innocent? It's the same thing.
t1_dtp74va	0	*	Well Mueller wasn't involved. Of course it doesn't discredit him. But it discredits many other people within the FBI.  Bringing up Gowdy is a red herring.

t1_dupfy1f	0	*	Cool source bro. I have a peiece of paper right here that says I own Buckingham palace. Doesnt mean its a legit agreement thats binding in any way. 
t1_du4n15o	1	*	Broccoli Rob?
t1_dtvr9g9	1	*	i knew you'd say this. the article does not say that. the article says that many hunters think that, but it does not work out.
t1_dtwf6fy	0	*	If you don't then why would you support hunting a lion? Is lion meat more efficient to harvest?  Fuck no. Don't try to change the goal of the argument because you are losing. 
t1_dtvhmaj	1	*	This happens but often is due to incredibly poor living conditions affecting the pigs natural behaviour.
t1_dtx7k6b	1	*	Difference is the surgery is for the humans benefit, the person understands what is happening and it only goes on for max 12 hours not 72 of longer.
t1_dtvrazn	0	*	better than the source from you guys. i have yet to see a single one.
t1_dtxi3j9	0	*	1. Of course not 2. That's illegal 3. If it was legal (Like locally) I wouldn't support however I could see the benefit if some families did that locally. Its one kid sold or 5 dead kids. 
t1_dtwdz3a	1	*	You're literally making up statements that you think I made, which is adorable. You can't come up with a single valid argument. Keep trying buddy.
t1_dtw01n5	0	*	> ...these pesky animals,...      You've already broken away from logic at this point. WE are the intruders. The animals were already there. WE are the ones fucking up the equation.
t1_dtvfsao	0	*	sorry, I should have qualified if it wasn't clear in the post you quoted from otherwise. I meant in the context of poaching. 
t1_dtyd0t1	1	*	Boner champ?
t1_dtvqo5d	0	*	> I won't sacrifice my enjoyment of the outdoors  Weird. Personally I have enjoyed the outdoors a lot, and I will continue to do so.  But I can't remember that ever requiring me to slaughter anything.
t1_dtvxhi3	1	*	The guy you were replying to was replying to a comment suggesting that they don't eat the lion meat. That's what this thread of comments started from.
t1_dtvn0wi	0	*	My b thought it was a comment on hunting in general.  Yeah that's not hunting if they're caged. 
t1_dtvqes7	0	*	Wussup bruh 
t1_dtvglbf	1	*	/sigh ... I hate real life sometimes
t1_dtvgqq6	1	*	Right on.  I share the same sentiment.  If only others could understand the idea. 
t1_dtvxwb3	1	*	I never argued against that. 
t1_dtwg60n	1	*	Yeah idk why people don't take a second to look but they just get triggered and go off...
t1_dtvmm8r	0	*	That just sounds like self-centeredness. You know it would suck so you don't want it to happen to you, but to others... eh?
t1_dtvq05b	0	*	That's just wrong though; it costs far less in energy to produce a kilogram of grain, legume, etc. That would be eaten by an animal than it does to produce a kilogram of that animal.
t1_dtvn3bp	0	*	Make what ok? Mistreatment of animals? That's never okay.   But it's still food, and you can still eat it without mistreating it.
t1_dtvog0q	0	*	Plenty of other options. Even then I feel like it's easier to acquire a taste for beans than it is to grow meat in a lab or breed mindless livestock.
t1_dtvqq6k	1	*	Absolutely. I'm waiting on those lab grown meats
t1_dtvfdz7	0	*	It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia. You used to be able to find it on Netflix, but now it's only on there for Britain and Europe due to copyright. Still on normal television as far as I know.
t1_dtvjdlh	0	*	Prairie dog on a bicycle? That does sound cute as hell.
t1_dtvhi8f	1	*	I just didn't think you had it in you, I'm impressed!
t1_dtvgc5w	1	*	Many herbivores have as large or larger brains than us.
t1_dtvedm8	1	*	LEEUWBOSCH GAME LODGE website says the hunting area of the reserve is 2600 Hectare (ha) = 26 Square Kilometer (kmxb2) not super big but no cage either.
t1_dtvslm4	0	*	With literally no access to contraceptives and a high infant mortality rate that is not really a possibility.
t1_dtvnsug	0	*	Kinda looks like a before picture where the ingredients havent been combined yet. Are those mushrooms I see (top left)?
t1_dtvilml	1	*	Where does your meat come from then?   Your personal inconsistencies and morally relativistic statements show youre wrong.
t1_dtzk71g	0	*	Pretty much. If Hitler ruled the world and everyone was under him, it would be considered morallyrightto gas Jews.   Morals are entirely dependant on who you ask. 
t1_dtvjbcg	1	*	U0001f922
t1_dtvmqrx	0	*	Well, why do you think killing a lion is wrong?

t1_dtvksee	0	*	Well, she clearly did for a while...
t1_dtvrqtj	1	*	So is killing endangered animals!  Ironically, so is protecting endangered animals.
t1_dtvr8cf	1	*	The only difference between that place and where I live now is the island.
t1_dtvqsqy	1	*	Thank you!
t1_dtw2vo4	0	*	Wouldnt surprise me.
t1_dtwrrvb	1	*	I was making money hand over foot, Literally!
t1_dtxjlkb	1	*	That you have to go to such a logical extreme to even attempt to refute the concept should tell you something.
t1_dtvf43h	0	*	I could make an argument that cannibalism would be morally right.
t1_dtvo8wn	0	*	Why does that sense of morality not extend to tasty animals that aren't humans?
t1_dtvxt76	0	*	So if I kill and ate your dog that would be ok? How about your mother? It's ok as long as I eat them? 
t1_dtw0lv5	0	*	Cool, how long are you going to keep crying about how people vote differently to you when it's not relevant to the conversation?
t1_dtvpm3i	0	*	I will listen to understand why this is ok to you. It's definitely not something anyone should use as evidence. I don't get my info from podcasts with testimonial bias. 
t1_dtvp4w3	0	*	Hey look, more insanity! How strange that any time animal rights comes up, we find good sources for truly insane ideas that have no basis in reality. Hooray.
t1_dtvtlhw	0	*	The lion and conservation part, absolutely. I wasnt aware only Africans were allowed to comment on the story. 
t1_dtvnutc	1	*	I won't do your critical thinking for you any more than I already have.
t1_dtw04u5	0	*	In response to your last sentence - I dont see anything wrong with eating an egg that comes from a chicken raised humanely.
t1_dtvfbz6	0	*	Its always sunny in philadelphia.
t1_dtw0xrz	1	*	Plants and bacteria cannot suffer, as they simply don't have the hardware.
t1_dtvs5dv	0	*	Sad days, because now that Fox and Disney are doing that merger thing, Always Sunny in Philadelphia has been removed from Netflix. 
t1_ds3lsl3	0	*	Good excuse for occupying a people and then raping and murdering them. 
t1_duvescy	1	*	That's awesome, I hope you will find the strength to do it one day :)  (Maybe I will too, who knows)
t1_duvftax	1	*	Im from Australia, were terrible polluters.
t1_duvvy2b	1	*	I just find it boring. And grey.  It's nice for a weekend cos there's definitely stuff to do and see (and drink) but it gets old fast. 
t1_dtl5jcm	1	*	Pretty much the same everywhere. The weakness of Democracy is that anyone can lead. Even the functionally mentally challenged. i.e. U.S.
t1_ds5syff	1	*	This is so sad to [see](https://www.flightradar24.com/)
t1_du8ttuy	0	*	Try finding a reputable source.
t1_duqcw3b	1	*	No I misread than any year vs more than the previous 3 years combined. Still they issued many.
t1_dsm1x1p	0	*	Good for you. What about the pretty healthy chunk of America that would have a hard time getting by if their food budget goes up even 5%?
t1_du7266z	0	*	Gotcha, I think the air strikes are effective at eliminating the intended target but I'm not so sure the ends justify the means considering the collateral damage and unintended consequences 
t1_du6ocdz	1	*	UN Security Council is above ICC.
t1_du70lfc	0	*	Sure, but I do think theres an aid program for certain things, and in general, the NK regime will avoid buying things on the international market at all, apart from oil.
t1_dsjz94l	1	*	Exactly. There's this weird propensity when it comes to tech reporting to try and treat everything as the next big thing, no matter what the field is or what the advancement actually does.
t1_dsk16nm	0	*	Really? Never mixed a bottle of ammonia and bleach ??
t1_dskjuoz	1	*	NK has supplies of VX. Probably accessible for determined people.
t1_dslal2m	0	*	How about jars of monkey farts?
t1_dsljecf	0	*	I really doubt they can be cheaper than rockets, considering they're much more complex. 
t1_duoqv8i	0	*	I didn't make any straw man. It's pretty clear you didn't actually read the article because it demonstrates that both the Nazis were in fact socialists.
t1_duoh3yc	1	*	Inferior to nuclear, obviously. I said coal is also inferior. 
t1_dunwy4s	0	*	no wish to have honest discussion?
t1_duo4nv6	1	*	Could run trials in the primaries, those are private affairs anyway.  
t1_duofuea	0	*	But yeah I'm selfish... 
t1_duod59g	0	*	I mean, yeah, that's the way pretty much all jobs are going. Eventually we're going to have to retrain to a post-scarcity society.  Or we all die, but yeah.
t1_duni15k	1	*	I think it's safe to say he has never had a critical thought in his life, not even once. 15th century logic.
t1_duntr0b	0	*	Parts yes. But I dont think weve had such a blatant fuck the other side administration in years on either side. Trumps primary motivation seems to be undoing anything Obama did. 
t1_duqa5za	1	*	I guess both are used in place of each other. The MiB universe doesn't seem to care. 
t1_duob9fs	1	*	Whats wrong with spanish? 
t1_dunwczj	0	*	> the rest of the world's staunch conservatives  > the rest of the world  Honestly, how fucking dense can you people be?
t1_dunosrm	0	*	I think you might be confused, which is unsurprising.
t1_dunoef5	0	*	He's claiming he knows exactly how the news would look if we somehow could have a utopian free press. 
t1_dunu0rw	1	*	I wouldn't have said anything if pure fiction wasn't being touted as fact. I don't want to get into subjective political opinions, so I'll leave it at that.
t1_dunp689	0	*	Since you have already decided what I am saying before I say it I see no reason to continue this conversation.  We are done here. 
t1_dunzavr	1	*	I'd argue he lies more than most people and most Americans would agree. 
t1_dunvlv5	0	*	Not a native speaker, and i wasn't making fun of his broken english, but him calling his job at putin's troll farm data science
t1_dunv3hf	1	*	Shit my bad mate. Fuck that guy. 
t1_dsgi16x	0	*	Get solar and power wall, that will knock the emissions down.
t1_dsgf1oe	1	*	Water contamination is a huge problem, leather tanning is a relatively small contributor when looking nationally.  And yes, it is an an environmental disaster locally, as was the Cuyahoga river. 
t1_dsgxffe	0	*	lol like I said, it is a hard pill to swallow for you Americans. Getting all rattled and insecure.
t1_dtt8j4y	0	*	Actually it is.  If 5 people punch you but you only press charges against one, then bringing up the other 4 is a valid point.  'Whataboutism' is just a buzzword deflection.
t1_dt38od0	0	*	Well, thats edgy. Have fun with that. 
t1_dt38q1j	0	*	But as an atheist you dont think their evil conspiracy to end the world will work because there isnt a prophecy to fulfill anyway?
t1_dttbjv5	0	*	Taxes, please.
t1_dtwlrjh	0	*	See Cuba post Soviet collapse, and tell me again if that was a successful independent country.
t1_dttgtyo	0	*	I may be broke af, but I can share what I've learnt in navigating tighter times! 
t1_dttvatg	0	*	Soon, my friend. Once I pay my debts and sell my house to buy a sailboat. What's a good semi-secluded port in Australia? I need to scratch the daydream sailor itch.
t1_dtudglj	0	*	Why,  so you can spout fake news or whatever weak defense?  I've learned via experience that you cultists can't be reasoned with. 
t1_dttdnyd	0	*	it wasn't even personal, cunt
t1_dttc22q	0	*	the Aus gov pays for all of that. Our paramedics make 120k every year
t1_dtuo0xt	0	*	I've seen this before but I am but a simple Scottish man and not down with the US kidspeak,, is this like 'catch me outside'? Like for a fight? Or do they vend currency?
t1_dttf9ng	0	*	How have you misunderstood this so badly?   I am just done at this point
t1_dtuzgia	1	*	Nope
t1_dttdhra	1	*	Government subsidized/free annual coupon to see PCP's for low income? Use it or lose it, would it work?
t1_dtti9js	1	*	It's pretty normal for us. I don't personally mind it. I do see both sides of the argument though 
t1_dtudla1	1	*	What? Tricare is not part of the VHA. 
t1_dttjimp	0	*	Daycare or learning center? Because that's insane for a regular daycare.
t1_dtu1blb	1	*	I hear what you're saying. I'm not one to disagree with you, we just see the world differently. I realize my story is just that, my story.
t1_dttyz74	1	*	I do understand the difference....But I also understand how laws are actually made....And it's not with the president.  I do like how you completely skipped over the whole opposition thing. Nice. 
t1_dv7pqae	1	*	It's not?  Who would win in a straight up war vs. current day USA?
t1_dttmrae	0	*	Go back to /r/thedonald you clearly have 0 idea what you're talking about 
t1_dttue1j	1	*	I think he's one of those why don't the homeless just get a job geniuses.... 
t1_dtu24vd	1	*	Actually both the UK and US have a pretty low mobility NOWADAYS compared to western standards.
t1_dttil5k	0	*	>Same with American health insurance companies, though.   I know, that was amy whole point; that the NHS is government insurance.
t1_dttpuzr	1	*	Cuba has a lower infant mortality rate than the US as well. That's right, the US can't even keep its fucking babies alive at a rate close to that of Cuba.
t1_dttek5e	0	*	We've already had one Gen X President and quite a few policies or stances he had were quite left, especially for America.  The future looks good if we can get more youthful politicians, I think.
t1_dtwc0a7	1	*	OP- the USA has shitty education  Other Guy- our higher education is the best in the world  You - You're wrong Google it  Me- I googled it, here's why 2 he was correct  You - That is Irrelevant!!!

t1_dttoq7m	1	*	Hi, I just recalled [Noah Smith](http://noahpinionblog.blogspot.mx/2016/12/an-econ-theory-falsified.html) has a decent entry on the topic. 
t1_dttel6f	0	*	Yeah, my point is that a doctor isn't earning much money. If we were rolling in it then childcare costs wouldn't be a problem surely.
t1_dttmsdn	0	*	How is a public school not free? most low income areas have free lunch for everyone as well
t1_dtx1buz	0	*	Not really though, I was in for 4 years as infantry and never got deployed. 
t1_dtte461	1	*	Damn, getting shade from North Korea about our healthcare  Probably deserve it though

t1_dttksgf	0	*	According to [this article](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/circumcision-rates-declining-health-risks-rising-study-says/), it was 77% of male infants in 2010, down from 83% in the 60s

t1_dttfgjs	0	*	Every morning? I thought it was only once a year wtf?
t1_dttt12t	0	*	Another condescending reply from the guy who doesn't think business people are job creators. 
t1_dttsoh2	0	*	You think the IRS actually enforces all that.  Bless your heart.
t1_dttoq9d	0	*	Not even sure what thats supposed to mean.   Im gonna assume youve got confused. 
t1_dttnbcg	0	*	Tell that to at-will states.  And even then that's off topic, the fact is that people's relationship to their jobs is far less free in the US than many other countries.
t1_dtw24um	1	*	Wow...that is just sad if it is no exception.  Is she self-employed and there is something extremely important happening? Or really just cashier and she will get fired of she doesn't show up?
t1_dttd0jy	0	*	Move out of London to save on rent  
t1_dttvne6	1	*	He just wants to argue lazily it seems, and your math kinda killed his argument *and* his ability to be lazy on the topic.
t1_dttymgz	1	*	I fail to see how my comment has anything to do with free healthcare.
t1_dtup0s8	0	*	Correct, that is according to the government guidelines, not my logic.
t1_dtumfzs	1	*	I never trust data from agenda driven organizations. 
t1_dttnfmo	0	*	Not disagreeing with you, but have seen first hand that prisoners get bored out of their wits. They will literally volunteer for anything to see daylight or a change of scenery.
t1_dttidmk	0	*	Don't you think
t1_dttkwwt	1	*	To clarify, I'm for universal healthcare. The question is how do we get there with the prevailing attitude.
t1_dttd3nq	0	*	Insurances work the same way though. You lose some amount of money unless you have to make a substantial claim.
t1_dttbx0q	0	*	For one kind of cancer... some doctor you are if you think showing one set of convenient stats constitutes an argument.  How much would I pay?
t1_dttcic9	0	*	Genius, we're comparing the current American system to the NHS. We're not saying it doesn't exist. In context, screwed means it sucks compared to the NHS.
t1_dttfh3f	0	*	Thank you, sincerely, but I'm far from amazing, I'm just tired of seeing people get hurt by the current economy. <3 
t1_dttwnk1	1	*	Pro tip: enjoy your five pound prostate while you still can.

t1_dtdlhxs	0	*	Israel doesn't purposely kill civilians.
t1_dtdvc0m	0	*	Of course becoming very wealthy isn't common. 
t1_dtdvh85	0	*	It sort of is. There is no value created by moving money around. It's not ethical to say the least. Whether it's corrupt or not is up to debate. 
t1_dtdxmng	1	*	That's why he's the first president not to have a pet. Not allowed around them. Sad.

t1_dtfx995	1	*	We can take solace that outside the internet, people don't regularly go but why would you be mean to a nazi? Don't you know that's worse than being a nazi?  It's a sheltered redditor view.

t1_dsuiqs8	0	*	The conflict is not over the settlements, that is a side effect. The conflict is over the existence of israel.
t1_dugrkxl	0	*	Sure let's change subject to avoid having to admit it still, alright i'll bite: What issue are you hinting at that the gop is defending and can't admit they are wrong on, exactly?
t1_dsa3atb	0	*	No unless you're cool with saying that Israel genocided Palestinians. 
t1_ds9v7vv	1	*	The type of social and legal pressure that can take down gropey hollywood types is unlikely to work on 3rd world warlords who routinely butcher entire villages or kidnap hundreds of young girls.

t1_ds9u3ms	1	*	Nah the sticker is worse.
t1_ds9h3j1	1	*	That doesn't imply genocide unless that's also true for the occupation of Palestine. 
t1_ds9gnix	0	*	They wanted to kill civilians. I'll doubt they are limited resources, as you said, Iran supports them.
t1_ds9lfew	0	*	Other countries committed genocide too so ...  FYI there's no right of conquest and acquiring territory ztill doesn't mean you get to drive out the inhabitants
t1_ds9dvnj	0	*	Intel is Israeli, motherboards are commonly Taiwanese or Chinese and RAM is South Korean.  Seriously man, stop it, you aren't good at this computing thing.

t1_dsb1u4g	1	*	Haha don't be silly. We just eat that raw.
t1_dsekipa	1	*	Ive met some republican voters who spoke what I would have a hard time calling English.  Not really the best nor brightest either.  I try not to draw generalizations from small sample sizes.
t1_dseiya3	0	*	No, people that mindlessly cheer anything anti immigrant are in fact xenophobes and deserved to be called out as such. It is a much nicer term than what I would personally use.
t1_dsfvuzy	1	*	Well, ideally the best course of action is to absorb the El Salvador people already here and then end the program to prevent future abuse.  Also, no not much can be done to help El Salvador right now.

t1_dt7c6pd	0	*	What part of interpretations can change do you not understand?   
t1_dt6f666	1	*	No. I mean, if you self-identify as Nazi I don't give a flying fuck what happens to you.   Though to be clear, I'm not happy about vigilante justice, either. If you get attacked, have fun though.

t1_dt6t3uq	0	*	Just no.
t1_dt6um0f	1	*	Ah. I totally Poe's Law'd your first comment.
t1_dt6ar3d	1	*	Thanks god
t1_dum5jxs	0	*	Who gives a fuck about what burden of proof technically means. He has made no effort in challenging any of the sources or points, and has been deflecting ever since
t1_ds652us	1	*	Yeah I do, I actually went to Washington to protest the lie that was the Iraq war. It hasn't ended, only now we are bombing more countries. 
t1_duik3z1	0	*	..and then the North invaded. They didn't have to, but they did. You don't refute the point.
t1_duivkli	1	*	>what a shame i see the world objectively.   buahahahahhahahahah!!!!
t1_dumnxl2	1	*	Of course it is. You think you've got everything figured out and anyone who disagrees with your interpretation must be a nobody with no knowledge. Funny how your type projects so consistently. 
t1_dv0so1b	0	*	No it's not hard to say:  http://www.businessinsider.com/global-terrorism-terrorism-increased-deaths-from-terrorism-decreased-2017-11

t1_dv0rhfl	0	*	Israel doesn't have the power projection or the sustainability of munitions to destroy Iran.
t1_dv0qqh1	0	*	Read the post, the School Bus Massacre in 1970 was the most impactful attack, but it wasn't the only one. In the 70s and 80s the PLO would do cross border raids/attacks on a normal basis.
t1_du0qp76	0	*	And?
t1_duxoc3n	1	*	He's just projecting.
t1_duxpbyh	0	*	Biafra didn't fight for civil rights because of punk, he used punk as a tool. And when punk went to shit (like Dead Kennedys songs in Levi commercials) he started using other tools.

t1_duugpl1	0	*	They arrest them while pregnant? Do they also force them to abort?  Or do they arrest them only after the child is born? What happens to the children?   Do you have a source for this?
t1_dtiq4vz	0	*	I don't think even you know what you are trying to say.
t1_dtwnnbf	1	*	That's not necessarily true, but as I've said before, I hope you're correct.
t1_dsqysfc	0	*	Wrong. Bye.
t1_dsn4nso	1	*	To that I agree.
t1_dsqduni	0	*	It's not irrelevant. It took them 38 minutes to respond, in 40 they would have hit NY. Hawaii is far less.
t1_dso5w0q	1	*	That's kind of what I'm thinking. I don't really buy the wrong button deal, but I have no idea how WEA and EAS interact with each other. 
t1_dsnamq8	0	*	We very much do know that there aren't subs with anti-missile tech.
t1_dso80tl	0	*	Cursing without reason   Its not a way to debate an argument.  Therefore - not smart 
t1_dsn5a8o	0	*	I meant more for military/naval bases around Hawaii and what types of vehicles would be scrambled and timing of pers recalls + number of pers recalled to base more then civilian response.

t1_dsmuua4	1	*	Shit, gotta make sure my pipboy is in working order, then...
t1_dsniv03	0	*	Well, yeah that's true. I don't dispute that.  I'm curious what the Russians claimed about Satan 2.  I read they claimed it was able to avoid THAAD.
t1_dsn8a70	1	*	Are we dead yet?? No, false alarm.

t1_dticcba	1	*	Yeah, morality is very arbitrary, and humans are not made to be logical
t1_dth4byl	1	*	Why bringing up this example then? Better compare it to forced surgeries to save your life, death sentence, mandatory vaccination etc. 
t1_dsc9bv7	0	*	Youre not a woman.

t1_duux8hi	1	*	This guy strategises.
t1_duuuec3	1	*	Nah, bodies of ore.
t1_duuog0o	0	*	Who the fuck cares about this conversation? Youre arguing semantics when the point was just to say that China sucks at giving a fuck about the ocean. Do you disagree? No? 
t1_duuthbd	0	*	Its both. You might be one of them.
t1_duueg6a	1	*	I don't think you've ever critically studied the history of the world or understand how modern world works judging by your previous comments...
t1_duujyfg	0	*	Which country would you say is the grossest representation of the US ex filtrating their resources and markets in an unethical way.  Which case is the worst?  
t1_duvjrii	0	*	There are more people that are not Chinese or Indian.
t1_duv52tk	0	*	i think their racism takes a back seat to making shitloads of money off of the lives of others. 
t1_duv4fd7	1	*	You are thinking of the J-31.  The J-20 is theorized by most experts to be designed to take out tanker and AWACs.  China is also testing some extremely long range a2a missiles as well.
t1_duv9ag7	0	*	Uh yeah.  FDR?  That's why they made the two term limit.   And the Chinese president is elected by the National People's Congress, not the people as a whole. 
t1_duuqm8x	0	*	Fair. Like I said, I'm not sure about Minke whales. I was just contending the general sentiment that I got that whaling was insignificant. 
t1_duuxjbg	1	*	You're talking about a historical event which happened with a complete different government, and different times, which in no way reflects the present day society there....
t1_duuohjm	0	*	And you seem to not understand the incredible difference between these two situations in the UK and in China.  They are not the same.
t1_duupxyq	0	*	When has foraging and hunting ever provided us with the quantity of food we are farming now? Farming is what has enabled us to eat the way we are.
t1_duv0t5t	0	*	that isnt what China did, they claimed the territory and then built the islands. Also what does that have to do with anything. Did you run out of relevant things to say?
t1_duuk87q	0	*	Why can't people care about both? All you're doing here is attempting to totally derail a conversation about animal welfare by injecting a conversation about a different animal's welfare. 
t1_duvapo4	1	*	Smart guy. Keeping the good genes on the family (remember that girl being very pretty indeed).

t1_duuskbj	0	*	See my other reply to you.
t1_duxe9al	1	*	Read up on the Cod Wars. This shit happened between Iceland and the UK in the last fifty years. About trawling rights.
t1_duvteas	1	*	Except in India, Mongolia, Vietnam, Korea, Russia, Cambodia, Tibet etc. all within the last 70 years. Saying China doesnt have wars because of its untenable boarder positions is just flat out false. 
t1_duuplyr	1	*	No excuses, you're right. My point isn't that what they are doing should be excused. **My point is that we shouldn't feel high and mighty as our evil actions occurred an hour ago.** 
t1_duux3wq	0	*	This is part of the reason why the UK still uses deisel-electric submarines. They're almost impossible to track.  Nuclear submarines are much less stealthy.
t1_dt771oq	0	*	I don't think you'd know sexism if it cockslapped you.
t1_dtx62mu	1	*	I think governments have more important things to deal with than monitoring their people's gestures against a terrorist organization. 
t1_du09v72	0	*	If you believe that a person gets to choose to destroy their lives unanimously, without any intervention from society /family, then you are NOT an adult. 
t1_du0bb6k	0	*	I like how you ignored the other guy ignoring points of the argument, but the second someone resorts to insults you get involved.
t1_dsh83it	1	*	Weird.  It worked for me this AM and the data showed an upswing.  Not sure why the link isn't working now.

t1_dshtesm	1	*	Yes, it is the legal minimum. I never said otherwise.
t1_dsh4epn	0	*	It is. If you can live on what you make, it is a living wage. What you really mean is MORE!!!!
t1_dsgv0ux	0	*	So the multi million dollar company doesn't need those workers?
t1_dsjloim	0	*	I never said I agree with you. I'm just pointing out how minimum wage has actually increased.   You were off by a couple years. So thank you for trying. 
t1_dshc5ug	1	*	Oh yea bud, just past the one beside the McDs!
t1_dsh5vjl	0	*	I am not interested in liberal agitprop.

t1_dsjq8yn	0	*	And electricians who can't because they're also taking care of their ill family?
t1_dshorvz	1	*	In BC there are talks of the same increase to 15 currently.  To reflect Ontario I guess divide by 4?
t1_dshioqf	1	*	Schools and retirement villages is what they are being converted to out in Phoenix. 
t1_dshcvb1	1	*	Because our country seems to think that abstinence-only education and restricted access to abortions are a good idea.
t1_dsh93ra	0	*	I can find similar examples of anti white racism on OGFT that gets upvoted as well, but it would fall on deaf ears because it's somehow acceptable. 
t1_dsihyq7	0	*	 Man, you're absolutely clueless about life. I hope you get to experience being poor and jobless at some point.
t1_dslmvp5	0	*	Except that has literally never happened in the history of the world.  You do know that trickle-down doesn't work, right?
t1_dsk2ryd	0	*	Please. Dont reply. Just stop.  It hurts to read this stuff. I get reminded that people like you vote. I dont want to be subjected to it. Stop.
t1_dshav1i	0	*	>If we are talking about labour markets than the attrition caused by this increase is outweighed by the majority of people that will benefit.  Not true at all.   
t1_dshl9dc	1	*	Lol alright, thats pretty funny.
t1_dsigio8	0	*	>free fair trade  Literally no such thing.
t1_dshcgd0	1	*	It does make a difference, good point!
t1_dt8zzpe	0	*	You might want to read that more carefully.    The age difference law only applies to people under 16.
t1_dt8ezah	1	*	Too many people actually think like he does, I always try to engage these ones because its likely someone reading it (even if hes a troll) feels the same as him

t1_dtgltjw	0	*	Perhaps I am referring to the bill being discussed? 
t1_ds66s34	0	*	W-what.   Please explain to me what you think a trade deal is.  A contract between two companies to provide goods/services is *not* a trade deal.

t1_dslzqx9	0	*	Anyone who claims others are empirically inferior without objective measurements if an idiot. Nazis claimed the same thing about Jews. 
t1_dslyz4d	1	*	God, I see why you think everyone is a racist now. Its because youre a right cunt. 
t1_dsm20xm	1	*	Oh I agree. They're better than planes, they just have their own share of flaws.

t1_dsm523s	1	*	And you can interpret it differently. 
t1_dsm04b8	0	*	I guess this must be the end then.
t1_dsmq5jv	0	*	Yes we are, but, again, asking me where I stick my dick in casual smalltalk is not the same as wondering where me or my family were born.  It's an absurd comparison. 
t1_dslyx5d	1	*	I'm Bolivian, but not native. I'm pale as fuck. Think we were descended from Spaniards. Got cousin's in Bolivia but I don't see them all that often. Grandparents came over legally, or so they say.

t1_dsm0wsh	1	*	Well no shit - I'm not the one claiming it wasn't for selfish purposes so ask him.  
t1_dsmfwvw	1	*	I don't think you are asking their ethnicity. You are asking where they live. So don't act like you don't get the difference 
t1_dsr40x7	1	*	I have my days.  You however, are probably a dipshit 100% of the time.  
t1_dsmqrqn	0	*	If you claim something happen and I say I dont remember that happening it calls into question your claim.

t1_dudv4eb	1	*	Okay, I get it.
t1_due3z7c	1	*	You seem pretty upset.

t1_dum1f1w	1	*	So more beatings but less shooting? Still fucking absurd really.
t1_duqmcfz	0	*	And it would require everyone to be a lot more introspective.  In the book, the epistemocrats introspect all the time.  The political debates would be so reasonable!

t1_dsqasdr	0	*	Oh don't even get me started on the Toronto Police. This girls name was all over the news. She's 11 years old. Her identity should had been protected, not used as political propaganda.

t1_dsq7uci	1	*	Dont forget Madeleine Albright at a Clinton rally saying women who dont support each other have a special place in hell. Sexism was a large part of her platform.
t1_dsq7sfg	1	*	No, a religion isn't a race so that's still not racist. Religious persecution maybe , depends on the reasoning for the law.
t1_dsqfj9s	1	*	You gave two examples.  And only one is an example of somebody lying.  The other was a misunderstanding that got blown out of proportion.  And it happened *three years ago*.
t1_dsrb1qg	0	*	That's exactly what I said. Some factors but not all. See? Your memory was wrong.
t1_dsq7zch	0	*	Agreed, it's too broad and accusatory a statement to just accept as truth without first doing some kind of research on the topic. Good chat though, hope to see you around here again sometime!

t1_dsqbjmh	1	*	>he knew it looked like a bomb hence why he brought it in in the first place.   Nah, this is Alex Jones conspiracy theory territory.

t1_dt2olw3	1	*	I am sadly an infrequent redditor and have little experience with moderating and being a reddit pro. I'd definitely appreciate a Centrism subreddit.

t1_dt1jy28	0	*	Actually, it was. A republic is never beholden to the people. The people at large don't control the politics.
t1_dt1pbgx	1	*	So you're just gonna ignore the per capita numbers? Do Chinese people not have the right to use resources because they live in a country with more people?
t1_dt1rrvq	0	*	I get confused with communist and cooperative sometimes, very nuanced.  Mondragon Corporation is structured that it could become a communist society.

t1_dui0ypd	0	*	No, it doesn't describe the VA. I suppose the VA in isolation is like a single-payer system, but since veterans can choose not to use it, I wouldn't call it single-payer from their perspective. 
t1_duhtuoz	0	*	Most drugs are made by the company reinvesting in it's own departments. So yes, they come from scientific discovery, but are not funded by the taxpayers. 
t1_duied3b	1	*	Yeah, took a while for me to put the blame for that where it belonged too. 
t1_duhsi4s	0	*	Supporting the wrong initiative cause the right one is hard is not a good idea either. Rate setting is immoral and essentially turns doctors into slaves (you will perform tasks at a specific price).

t1_dtvt40e	0	*	Ignoring things you don't like and refusing to accept that you may be wrong is what got us into this mess with Trump as president in the first place. But carry on winning. Oh boy, you sure showed me.

t1_dtgnmzt	0	*	One last time - you stated that temperature changes are naturally occurring. That's what I'm discussing - I didn't even say anything about Paris. Defend it or admit that it's bullshit.
t1_dtd252x	0	*	> *I am was the last person to run on left wing ideology...*  What does your last sentence mean?

t1_dteodds	1	*	Easy to do, it's text form conversation. Have a good day today. 
t1_dtd0103	0	*	Nice. A webcomic. 
t1_dteiy4d	1	*	World bank statistics buddy   Take it or leave it
t1_dtd35ld	1	*	Its okay, buddy. We are all on the same side here!
t1_dtemjzk	0	*	So out of the total votes, Trump got something like 48%.
t1_dtemj6j	1	*	Can confirm. No one likes Hillary, Bernie would've won had they not usurped his throne.
t1_dstgei8	0	*	How is it weird? is a little flap of skin that's there naturally.  
t1_dsqy6sk	0	*	You shower once per week? Time for you to migrate to a 1st world country. I recommend Australia, where cosmetic circumcision for newborn males is banned in all public hospitals.
t1_dsr8f41	1	*	I do believe you. Its actually common, in my experience, for circumcised guys to double down on how awesome it is because the alternative is a feeling of betrayal and violation.
t1_dupn1rg	0	*	That kind of thinking loses wars. Loss of trust in leadership can wipe out moral fast
t1_duq1eda	0	*	Lol
t1_dups3lk	0	*	Other leaders have engaged in repeated chemical weapons use and indiscriminate bombing of civilians??? Really?
t1_duprqy2	1	*	nice rebuttal  do you even know where al tanf is?
t1_dtbbmv1	0	*	Then they should be taught that asking a question is not a sign of weakness. Keep those good kind of teachers who encourage asking questions and certainly don't fire them.
t1_dt9m1np	0	*	You can put a :p after what you say to try and get me going. But I know you're secretly fuming as you type that. We all know that. Don't lie.
t1_dt91rq6	0	*	Professor? No. It's just language. Just google it for goodness sake if you have that much trouble.
t1_dt9p13u	0	*	I see. You are one of *those* people.
t1_dt8nenw	0	*	Its goals are egalitarian, its focus need not be. If you have a broken arm, you don't put casts on both arms just to make everything fair and balanced.
t1_dt9948l	0	*	Preponderencce of evidence is on the one making the claim.
t1_duif3ju	0	*	Only Sith deal in absolutes...... jokes aside you can have a merge of socialism and capitalism based on changing economy and dramatic reduction in scarcity brought on by automation. 
t1_duianjc	1	*	Right. Odds are they combine the smaller states with their larger neighbors and adopt something along the lines of the Wyoming rule.
t1_duik1r3	1	*	Yeah long term I agree, it would just take a big shift vs how people commute today.
t1_duicy1q	1	*	What?
t1_duii927	0	*	Eh... It's really less than 1% tricking 50%
t1_duiint7	0	*	Why do you think you or anybody else deserves all of their gross income or wealth.? They do not. 
t1_duifzhd	0	*	yeah dude....i agree with you...........
t1_dukh57o	1	*	Yup, you are too high in the clouds. Get real.
t1_duic5ry	1	*	Yup 1600 just outside the bay area for a. If I moved my income would drop significantly and I wouldn't have the benefits I have with my current employer.
t1_duiccqp	0	*	Uh... no?  I highly doubt my 401k and my tIRA are tax free.  
t1_duiw7ox	0	*	I feel the hurt in my 1040 numbers alright. Not sure what I can count as a  help that would be proportional though.
t1_duid052	1	*	Well, run away then. Nice of you to prove yourself wrong before you cower, though :)
t1_duib9cb	0	*	Temporarily embarrassed millionaires abound. 
t1_duicq2n	0	*	It's just ironic, I wouldn't have pointed it out at all had you not just called me uneducated.
t1_duimhq5	0	*	You're helpless. Have a good day.
t1_duiag4y	0	*	Probably. I would honestly imagine it having fewer members the higher it goes, but who knows! This probably won't be a thing for a few centuries at least!
t1_duibgs9	0	*	I hear theyll even give you tape for those holes and any new holes that may be shot into your box if you give em an extra $50/month
t1_duigahb	0	*	You read like 15 words and stopped didn't you?
t1_duie8mb	1	*	I was expressing my probably under-educated opinion. Not sure what help it was that you think I'm looking for.
t1_duic42x	0	*	They dont.   Police are there to protect the haves from the have nots. The police keeping their eye on poor communities is done as a service to the middle class. 
t1_duijcfq	1	*	They just work 10,000 hours a year.  No big deal.
t1_duis6mg	1	*	that still seems like a really good deal for that area, depending on how much piss there was
t1_duib1qw	1	*	Yeah, we're south of Kalamazoo and our house is less than 20 years old, so that's super nice!
t1_dukgptr	0	*	Im not even going to read all that. Got to the Star Trek analogy and I knew you had veered off track again.
t1_duij9yj	0	*	I know plenty of people who take multiple vacations per year and invest. Doesnt mean they are anything more than middle class...
t1_duibkl2	0	*	> but is also among the top  You could say the same if we were #94 too. That's pretty useless.
t1_dujma2d	0	*	It is, and it isn't as shitty as people think. Cincinnati is a pretty nice city; plenty of awesome food and an active nightlife with activities out the ass. 
t1_duk8ur1	1	*	It's a 19th century Victorian, just a real big single family home.
t1_duib9gx	0	*	So your argument is I might have more then 5 mill to give to my children on day so fuck you meanwhile....
t1_duiegf6	1	*	Hm haven't seen that before. Why was it a 2005 tax return, though? More than a decade ago, how relevant can it be?
t1_duifyp3	1	*	Then you clearly need to take some civics lessons then.
t1_dui82kl	1	*	Why is that?
t1_duijjdg	1	*	I answered you honestly and you ignored it.  Justice is what separates gangsterism from government.
t1_duifkmi	0	*	its a straw man argument. That's why they do it.
t1_duiq3du	1	*	...except we already had it at 91% and that didn't happen.

t1_duijk1e	0	*	Back2SuckingTrump'sDick  You're probably one of those Russian Bot accounts anyways
t1_duiics4	1	*	Okay word.  I see where you're coming from
t1_dujzqwa	0	*	> the only way to have a tax system where the rich do not have more post-tax income is through communism.  Dude, you have no idea what are you talking about.
t1_duic1to	0	*	Cant check on mobile, but this should be the right video:  https://youtu.be/-_7FaWnlhS4
t1_duiaps7	0	*	As someone from Michigan who commutes over 100 miles a day.. I can relate
t1_duic4na	0	*	Where is the city that is 45 minutes away from a place in rural Northern Michigan?
t1_dwxqq9f	0	*	I'll wait, when you're ready.
t1_dujl3su	0	*	That's like room enough for a bed per room. 500sqft in a square is like a 23x23. That's above average for 1 room. How do 3 rooms fit into that?
t1_duifqxq	1	*	Yeah, I'm going to go ahead and not waste my time on junky libertarian economics, and instead listen to people that have more of a grip on reality.
t1_duif2cz	0	*	I mean we spend about 20 a week in gas, is that bad? Ive never felt it was too much. We drive a toyota and a subaru though.
t1_duiggth	1	*	>The Fed increases the money supply by insane amounts and causes inflation to skyrocket.   Have you seen inflation rate for the past couple decades? 
t1_duic7xi	0	*	Most of developed Europe has both health care and affordable higher education, why can't the US? Caps on university fees would be a start.
t1_duid1im	0	*	I could say the same for your comment.
t1_dui9wl7	1	*	Nope nope nope.   You are the shittiest excuse for civilization man has yet propped up.
t1_dujtcjp	0	*	Did you want to actually explain your quirky viewpoint, or did you respond just to call me a horrific monster?
t1_duiavrk	0	*	I never made that much of a disengenious comparison.   Just that at the bottom of it all, it's all gambling. 
t1_duicngr	1	*	Oh I agree, and personally I think both sides over exaggerate the seriousness of the debt. It's not like anyone would dare to try and force the US to pay all its debts anyways.
t1_dujmdmc	1	*	yeah, I should say its 40 minutes to a store with grocerys, and an hour to the nearest supermarket. I don't know why I said 2 hours, It's 2 hours to the nearest big town though. 
t1_duzb77b	0	*	Well seeing as I'm the only one that has provided any solid numbers to this conversation I'd like to introduce you, the pot, to the kettle. 
t1_dv31zm4	1	*	I'm a rare example of a person who voted for both Obama and Trump.
t1_dv8ml6y	1	*	hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha.
t1_dteygdo	0	*	Nope. Just someone who is open to the idea that everyone can do good things.
t1_dtuqe3n	0	*	Not going to lie: as a result of steve1989 I have bought a bunch of French RCIR rations and seven seas emergency biscuits off eBay.  Nice.
t1_dtv3cj2	1	*	That's insane, will check it out next. Thanks for the rec!
t1_dtv3e4r	1	*	Lol nice. I've read the most random books that way myself.
t1_dtedctl	1	*	But if we don't do the sterilization/kill off immediately then the effect would take so long that we'd be fucked anyway. Your argument is still just as retarded, if not, maybe even more so now
t1_dter0ta	0	*	He fucking linked it, why don't you read it. 
t1_dtfkacb	0	*	It must be easy to say that without any regard to where one lives
t1_dtflpuw	0	*	Either way we need to do something. I was just confused with your wording, no offense. 
t1_dtgae9m	0	*	there's just no reality in which human civilization will stop driving cars, flying planes, or shipping across the ocean. the only option is to focus on making sustainable replacements
t1_dtg85xe	1	*	Interesting, thanks.
t1_dtmc9eb	0	*	easy to say when you dont commute 40 minutes a day and have to find your own work and your own place to live
t1_dteoa50	1	*	But you're the one making the outlandish claim. The burden of proof is squarely on you.
t1_dtem3fa	1	*	You fail to account for population; until relatively recently humans had room to move if one area got intolerable, which was quite common and resulted in many skirmishes for resources.
t1_dshdaff	1	*	Trump's idiotic foreign policy is a product of the alt-right. 
t1_dshqp0x	0	*	So you believe that bad people can win the award for doing good things. I'm glad we agree.
t1_dsfnqb9	0	*	Yes, they're paid lunches. No, but halal food doesn't have things in it that Christians aren't allowed to eat, so it's hardly comparable.
t1_dsfnopl	0	*	Depends on where you live. And that only applies during Lent anyway.
t1_dsfmrlk	0	*	I think pork chops is an American thing.  In the UK, we eat a lot of chicken and lamb, and our pork tends to be bacon, ham and sausages, all cured. 
t1_dtcq9p3	0	*	Please, point me in the direction of all these rich vegans who only buy organic, but also reject science. Perhaps I can make off with some good produce before I make my escape.
t1_dtdn8hy	0	*	If he did that you would jump on him for being preachy
t1_dtcsxem	0	*	...excepts thats not at all what I did.  I disagree.
t1_dtdcbds	1	*	Trust him. He has the best sources, just fantastic! No need to see them, just believe it because his sources are amazing, so why would you question them?   Yours are clearly fake sources... 
t1_dtdmeoc	0	*	so is soymilk though
t1_dtcvfi7	1	*	Believe me! Sad you don't believe me.. Thanks Hilary.
t1_dtcolk5	0	*	A vegan totally cool with tearing down a fellow vegans totally reasonable post, though.

t1_dtd8v12	0	*	Shut up. You are just a stupid living in you first world country bubble thinking you know more than the people in Brazil
t1_dtd19kf	1	*	Yep the hilly city really has some beauty. Kayaking on the Colorado was wonderful!
t1_dtcsfds	0	*	Idk it seems you're just venting cause you're not happy or upset at something. Like a cry for help, either way take care of yourself 
t1_dtd3x3b	1	*	Naw it'd be something by a huge intnl company. One dude said they have Heinz. I'd expect that or kraft. Glad it's not craft

t1_dslxxdt	0	*	No anger here, but agreed. Have a good night as well!
t1_dslpe5a	1	*	And keep in mind, by his own insane definition, if he says Norway he is a racist.  
t1_dsn4mor	0	*	what does the motives of the person leaking it have to do with whether it actually happened? Stay on topic, why would a republican senator lie on the republican president?
t1_dslwf0y	1	*	I don't think their appearance will come into account.
t1_dsm4h1c	1	*	You call that an argument? 
t1_dsox9hx	1	*	Braindrain. Don't worry, it's just a meme. No country has ever been harmed by losing all their qualified engineers, scientists and doctors!  I hope you acquire some intelligence one day.
t1_dsltnp7	0	*	Oh, that's why you presented a false dichotomy. Gotcha
t1_dsmcump	0	*	Racking my brain trying to think of which country that might be. Cause youre most definitely not talking about the democrats and republicans 
t1_dsmphnj	1	*	Lol.. why would they lie about that? *Gets popcorn*

t1_duunjfl	0	*	>The only reason why Obama didn't was because he never stood trial and was convicted.  You don't need to stand trial to be given a presidential pardon. You don't even need to be charged.

t1_dupwp06	1	*	Is that a yes or no regarding resisting apartheid?
t1_dupubwd	0	*	So, we can never do anything to encourage black farmers then?
t1_duq61qz	1	*	No idea, there'll be a summit where everyone will bring in their inputs and forge consensus on the way forward. 
t1_duq0k7p	1	*	Well this sub tells me apartheid was great, so I don't see why they care now.
t1_duq654t	1	*	The South African currency is at its highest levels since nearly four years, so it looks like investors are pretty confident too. 
t1_du2uhjx	1	*	You're heart bleeds too much in the wrong place.  And stop being an asshole.
t1_du2w4dx	0	*	Is that because they haven't finished your doping regime yet?

t1_du2x8g7	0	*	I know a handful of Russians were recently cleared of their bans but reputation damage has been done. Russian Athletes are now tarred by that brush.
t1_ds6k7lg	1	*	Can anyone here have a civil debate or make reasonable comments rather than insults? I keep forgetting this is a far left subreddit that eradicates any opinions swaying anywhere close to the right.

t1_dtszksf	0	*	i claim it myself. they make you pay if you work time as a student. and as a student it does matter because financial aid counts as education credits.  this is ridiculous

t1_dts6hni	1	*	He didn't enact it, he did as he pleased.
t1_dstyygz	1	*	Fair enough. 
t1_dtost5t	1	*	Not true. P-51s flew at 40,000 ft during WWII escorting bombers. Just need a heater, heavy jacket and an oxygen mask. 
t1_dtp1r7n	0	*	What makes you think he was unarmed?
t1_dtp1yvv	0	*	Okay, I'm sorry. I guess none of war is *okay* in that regard. 
t1_dtp1wl0	1	*	Later in the war, however, gas shells, which I assume would count as projectiles, were used. Maybe they found another loophole, or maybe they just didn't care.
t1_dtpus10	0	*	And again, laws exist in war. Otherwise I guess it's fine to use Chemical, Biological and Nuclear weapons against soldiers?
t1_dtqo3t7	0	*	I thought that phrase was pretty ambiguous personally.
t1_dtp3kzx	0	*	May I suggest that you mind your own business?  It's not your call to decide when, where, and how I post.    I responded to someone else's post, not yours.  Stick to your own backyard, mate.

t1_dtp5vap	1	*	There have been many upgrades, but one does have to remember that the main production facility is not in Russian hands. They fought a war in 2008 against Georgia, where these were made and produced.

t1_dtp1ti5	0	*	>he wouldn't accept being captured, and fired his pistol  ... >They still killed an unarmed prisoner of war  The BBC article also says he was killed after a fight on the ground now that i've read it.

t1_dsedvf5	1	*	I'm not thrilled about missing it, and thanks for pointing it out.
t1_dsej75s	1	*	It is strongly in a government's interest to maintain fiat currencies that they control to some degree. They may even use a crypto backing, but it will be of their design, and will contain inflation.
t1_dse4czo	0	*	I'm interested in why you think that's the case. Can you expand on your comment?
t1_dsewq83	1	*	Not that simple, if they can short the market with margin they can make a lot more than the value of the network!

t1_duhb351	0	*	Lol ok. troll. Keep bitching about Russia causing a divide while you do their work for them. 
t1_dufg9yv	0	*	How many times was BLM posted in /r/politics? Don't throw stones in glass houses. The indictment explicitly said they played both sides of this.
t1_dstoag4	0	*	To be fair, no Trek series has ever had a good first season
t1_dsuhn7b	1	*	Q is up there, hard to beat John Delancey. 
t1_dstugrp	0	*	Yep. They really fucked up klingons. They don't look or behave like them at all.     If you real want to change that much. Why not make up your own species? With blackjack and hookers.
t1_dstuv00	1	*	I totally agree, and still enjoy the show :)
t1_dstw4bt	1	*	Truuu
t1_dstvn4a	1	*	Someone else posted his comment about how much he hates gays. I dont think anyone is getting fooled by his particular brand of BS at this point.
t1_dstwted	0	*	It does have some issues. Quick- without looking it up, what is the pattern of the fifty stars?
t1_dsu0k80	1	*	What about Italian immigrants?  When do they stop being Italian?
t1_dstptie	0	*	Japans flag is just a red circle. Many other country's flags are just stripes. Does that make any flag worth more of less.
t1_dstvear	0	*	If you haven't already, check out The Orville. I didn't like Discovery at all, but I love Star Trek. The Orville filled that void for me.

t1_dtvden5	0	*	>Because it assumes the intention (or the lack thereof) of those women.  That's not an unreasonable assumption in many cases.
t1_dux338t	0	*	I'll agree. Full legalization of soft drugs and decriminalization of hard drugs is a logical first step.
t1_duyk3kb	0	*	And reality is that even if you legalize drugs, education isn't going to get better.
t1_duxvqzt	1	*	How often do you use heroin? 
t1_duyc3c0	0	*	That does not make them any less right in this case. The conceptual difference between decriminalization and legalization has already been clearly explained by other people in this thread.
t1_duwzizu	0	*	Legalisation does not prevent that from happening. Plenty of people are fired and lose custody of kids for being drunks. Also, people usually don't lose their kids for being addicts. 
t1_du4sbja	0	*	No, it isn't 
t1_du4skn4	0	*	It's not about the physical labor it's about shifting the entire country's schedule by an hour twice a year.  Our bodies natural clock isn't so easy to change
t1_du4ioc2	1	*	I attempted to rectify the misunderstanding by pointing out the obvious exaggeration.but instead of thinking oh, he was exaggerating you said that's not how you exaggerate. 
t1_dtmg4i0	0	*	Oh no, your blatantly obvious agenda!
t1_dtmijk8	0	*	It is a fact that Donald Trump is a mentally ill or dementia-ridden moron. Do you want me to post proof towards that statement? It has been a long two years, there is plenty of material.

t1_duai937	1	*	I know its been getting political pushback in the states because of the yuck factor, but I never thought about it as race/class factor in Cape Town. Thanks for letting me know, thats very interesting.
t1_du9lptm	1	*	East Texas is definitely not a desert. Especially along the coast. Drive east of Houston very far and you'll fall into the swamp. Hurricane Harvey ring any bells?
t1_du9icix	1	*	man i went one year and really thought about doing it. it wouldve been great 
t1_duaazss	1	*	It's a subjective and arbitrary measure, which is my point, but thanks for your kind words and concerns from my wellbeing!

t1_du9oz54	0	*	I just looked it up, Texas would be 10th, the thing that surprised me the most however was that Italy has a larger GDP than Russia 
t1_du9wocv	0	*	Oh, of course!  I'm not saying it can be done in 6 months. I'm just saying that it is possible. Even in Cape Town's case, the government knew that there would be water problems 2 decades ago.

t1_du8lal5	1	*	Nah, I understood these tired accusations years ago.
t1_dsq5e8v	1	*	> Shenzhen  That's impressive. Here in Hordaland (the county that Bergen is a part of) the politicians thought it was enough with 50 CNG buses (down from 80) and around 500 diesel buses.
t1_dtd4wwn	0	*	I get that, but theres plenty of folks out there saying Hilary would be POTUS if popular vote was the win condition.

t1_dsvzoa4	1	*	Fair enough :)  I think the number of times people actually notice a shark, and then it approaches them must be almost as rare as attacks.
t1_dsvj6xr	1	*	I know of this thing called heroin and its a good way to cure and get rid of this life thing. Ive seen it cure a lot of lives.
t1_dv0ja7o	0	*	Actually shark attack stats are notoriously unreliable because no one who gets shark attacked can possibly report it to the statisticians so

t1_dsg1yic	0	*	If your party offers a candidate that doesn't represent your values, it isn't doing right to vote for them any more than it is to simply not vote. 
t1_dsg96qu	0	*	> The election came down to ONLY two choices.   I wonder why.. totally not because of DNC pushing Hillary. They got backlash from their **own** shitty decision.  
t1_dsh2hz3	1	*	Nope again.
t1_dsgar9i	0	*	Sanders lost both the super delegates and the popular vote by a significant margin. The only way you can claim he should have one is if you insist that a vote for Bernie should be worth more.

t1_duv3d83	0	*	He just listed a bunch of random states hoping it would make him seem credible. Probably just a 16 year old who wants to sound smart

t1_ds656vt	0	*	So a Volvo is a Kia equivalent in your analogy? Thats a bit of a stretch. 
t1_ds5ydgb	0	*	Nope I just get a kick out of the old took mah jab joke. Get over yourself and form an argument or agree that you misinterpreted what I said because you have a chip on your shoulder.
t1_ds799x8	1	*	I would and do.

t1_dtzixdi	0	*	apparently it is :/
t1_dtxr9me	0	*	Context is important though. The comment was clearly referencing the alt-right. 
t1_dtxujnu	1	*	You say there's evidence of a theory I  link to an article debunking said theory. You unironically link to the very evidence debunked in the article and claim it makes your point? 
t1_dtxp3b6	1	*	You thought you could bullshit me with jargon, you mean.

t1_dtakhvh	1	*	Most politicians aren't incompetent when it comes to being hacked and falling for phishing scams. There is a reason people like Putin or Obama don't have thousands of their emails leaked.

t1_dv10e1q	1	*	I have no idea what you want to see in your first example. 
t1_duzp1bs	0	*	I don't.  Better to burn the bad guys' oil first.  The idea that oil is somehow fungible is one of the dumber ideas in economics.
t1_duzbxim	0	*	Yeah. Sarcasm. But I like how that's what you pointed out, and not the absurdity of a coal burning car.
t1_duzo2nj	1	*	I've also heard that after WW2, and the German invasion, Russia will never have a nonfriendly state on its border. They need buffer client States to prevent future land wars.

t1_ds9ncpg	1	*	Between 2015 and 2017, Canada essentially had two classes of citizens. If you weren't a natural-born citizen, you could have your citizenship revoked.

t1_dsa8m2h	0	*	Yeah, I'm the one crying here. That's rude.
t1_dsadgzc	1	*	Ok thanks for making your actual point. You are correct that I conflated lack of readmission with potential detention and investigations. Now I'm gonna get high. 
t1_dsa4af3	1	*	Ok, so it's not a choice that *you'd* make. But there are a ton of people who would.   For the life of me, I'll never understand why people can't look outside their own sphere of experiences.  
t1_dsgvwaz	1	*	I dont think that the above understanding is wrong. Its not correct if we go by how its supposed to be applied, but alas, that doesnt seem that important these days.(:cough: patriot act :cough:)

t1_dsaoxo0	0	*	That's the fault of our system that people have to pay off such massive debt.  But there's no need to take home more than a middle class income for any job.

t1_du1xmao	0	*	There's a reason why tu quoque is a logical fallacy; it's rare that you can't find something to claim is worse and it doesn't address the problem.
t1_du1ra31	1	*	Tommie Smith and John Carlos were the fucking picture of entitlement.

t1_du2acek	1	*	Your argument is that you refuse to consider any other argument?   Why?
t1_du1ms6m	1	*	People can make an issue about whatever they want.  Breaking news: gay person doesn't like Mike Pence  But how are they feuding? Does Pence know he's in a feud or is this just more clickbait? 
t1_du1rd9w	1	*	Soooo one example from 1968 discredits his point? 
t1_du1mvfy	0	*	It's good that Pence supports Religious Freedom, now they can just toss you out because you're gay. I hope you have savings and good health. Enjoy your Pence, fella.  Also, r/asagayman
t1_du1u0kn	0	*	no prob, Bob :3
t1_du1tds3	0	*	This guy can't even fathom it lol 
t1_du1icnp	0	*	Judging by your two responses...you quite clearly *didn't* get the point, but that's okay, I'd blame your quite clearly failed education in reading comprehension.
t1_du1hi77	1	*	Gotcha sexual behaviour is a condom. I suspect he's more of a no sex guy then a safe sex guy. It's 99% effective.
t1_du4ff5v	0	*	Because they weren't seen as evil when they didn't support it. People were able to see that just because they didn't support gay marriage didn't mean they were anti-lgbt. 
t1_du3h3io	0	*	Well that isn't what happens.
t1_du2hek7	0	*	Yeah I saw, you'd think someone so adamant about forming an argument he'd be aware of the most commonly accepted interpretation of a word.

t1_dv53i1c	0	*	What is wrong with that?  China has been extremely protectionist all along.  Trump is just the first one to come along that is forcibly calling them out on it.  
t1_dv4v9ck	0	*	When I said just in quotation marks that was in reference to your comment, not an assertion that I think its the only good car in America.

t1_ducw6dq	0	*	Very few places, if any, have the death penalty for opinions. China/Myanmar have a very high profile set of political prisoners. If they killed all who disagree those guys wouldnt exist eh?
t1_du8ic6x	1	*	Please provide source for your claims 
t1_du70suq	1	*	Trick  Based on what evidence or actions by Assange do those claims seem to even have a shadow of doubt?  
t1_du9mgoy	1	*	That's why they were using Sweden. Either way you think the CIA gives two shits what some pathetic UK court says?
t1_du70wfz	0	*	Cool. Now apply this to why Assange saying consequences are bad! makes him breaking more laws okay.
t1_du72iu2	0	*	The police? His family? Private investigators? His influential friends?  Do you really think that he would disappear and suddenly nobody would care? Everyone would shrug their shoulders and go 'meh'?
t1_du84qtb	1	*	Why are you even bothering? It's clear that /u/TinynDP isn't interested in the actual law.
t1_du74fgv	1	*	However, those discriminatory laws *were still laws* until new legislation was constructed.
t1_dsvsj41	0	*	so you will never believe this news, no matter the evidence presented?

t1_dsl7dny	0	*	ROC we're definitely not saints but they just we're not on the same level the PRC was.
t1_dsa3wtb	0	*	How does that make sense at all? It's not economically possible to have that number of hostels, but they were offered accommodation which they chose not to take
t1_dt0fsm0	0	*	I used the definition of the word to create a misinterpretation of evolution.
t1_dtpxbqx	0	*	There was no intermarriage between Muslims and Christians , so no not vice versa. If a Greek became a muslim he was excluded from the Greek community. 
t1_dss1von	0	*	I forgot about them after they got blown out 40-0 by the Ravens. 
t1_dseleye	1	*	Because the MB *is* still in solidarity with the Palestinians
t1_dseyncz	0	*	Nah the US would be too busy trying to stop a third world war because all of Arab allies would collapse or turn. 
t1_dsgt4eq	0	*	It's also important to note that if Israel had the oil resources it would likely be more difficult to control both Israel and its resources. It is already somewhat difficult to control Israel
t1_dseyv5u	1	*	Does that mean you want to stop paying Egypt? 
t1_dtbc8sc	0	*	What the fuck are you talking about? Try that again, but this time, try a little something called coherency. 
t1_dt2zrg2	0	*	And there it is, folks. Open and shut.   Because the government studied the habits of minorities and proceeded to target them for their behaviors.

t1_dtmtovy	1	*	No.
t1_dt16x2q	0	*	Democrats were a sweeping loss under obama for a reason.  Yes but not as much as you think. 
t1_dt7p6kk	0	*	3rd worst in the EU is still more than likely 24th best in the world. admittedly, commissioning coal power plants is certainly short sighted. 
t1_dt796ke	0	*	An electric barge is the perfect fit for this use case.  But feel free to move the goal posts.  Do you really think their will be 20,000 nuclear powered cargo ships?

t1_dut47bl	0	*	Ffs I have. You compared Democrats disagreeing with Republicans to the Holocaust. Farewell.
t1_dut2pph	0	*	Half of Europe is not functioning either, India? South Africa?... Americas voting system is a game, literally a worse BigBrother. 
t1_dut2bst	0	*	Is the occurrence of hypocrisy large enough to justify a shot at China though? Whether there's a debate after such incidences I feel is another topic.
t1_dut7qn2	1	*	Im saying just because youre forced to learn it doesnt mean the majority of people retain the skills or have the ability to use it. French is also popular. 
t1_duth63q	0	*	I have no stats but I think youre wrong about maintaining the same political views through life.  Peoples circumstances change and their political leaning changes. 
t1_dut3l17	1	*	Holy shit you are insane, RBG is an anti-constitution cunt who thinks that the purpose of the Supreme Court is to write laws.  Sotomayor is the same way.
t1_dut234z	0	*	The comment I replied to literally said its unthinkable a person like that could come *into power*. How are you arguing nobody is saying that?
t1_dutmzrr	0	*	Absolutely when all else fails.
t1_dutbwfg	0	*	Why is only the last 30 years relevant to the conversation?
t1_duvac0p	1	*	I assume you mean the Chinese think the strike was deliberate? I have never heard a reasonable argument that it was deliberate on the American's part.
t1_dwguhn4	1	*	How old are you?
t1_dut44pl	1	*	You are right though. I read through his history, he writes a lot about his time in the US Army, definitely not a chinese bot.
t1_dut7u2g	0	*	Switzerland isn't socialist...
t1_dut0ra8	0	*	What do you think will be more significant in the long run, a semi-popular meme or banning a beloved character because everyone knows you hated the semi-popular meme? 
t1_dut8wrp	1	*	Ahhh didnt get that :P. My bad.
t1_dut2y8n	1	*	Ikr? User wants to put the word inmature in their comment and then sweep it under the rug like it never happened when they get called out. Now I look like a crazy person. 
t1_duthto6	0	*	No he's no one at all, that's why you're talking about him and why he's well known in history and why the Chinese regard him as the founding father of their country.

t1_dutebs7	0	*	As far as I'm concerned, if NM has 1/20 the people California has, it is both fair and necessary that California has 20x the power within the federal government.

t1_dsklxsj	0	*	You need a cup of tea as well. A happy liberal is a non-violent liberal! Keep it up champs, we believe in you!
t1_dskjqyb	1	*	The electoral college is a classic example of indirect representation.
t1_dskgg9w	1	*	I haven't spent much time in Pennsylvania. At most driven through a small part of it. I went to college in Idaho and settled in Oregon. 
t1_dskjvak	0	*	Yup. You wanted to argue that the right is worse than the left. I didn't say that so you pretended I did anyway and then argued against it. That's a Strawman .

t1_dskax0h	0	*	Did I say it did? 
t1_dskcibz	0	*	Whilst our NHS has issues I wouldn't change it for the world. It's current issues are more to do with our ruling party making cutbacks without any care or thought 
t1_dskdri1	1	*	The content might not be, but the poster certainly is.
t1_dsk7p8o	0	*	I'm not equating them at all. I just chose a random subject to put in there to show how absurd that line of thinking is
t1_dslfmq7	0	*	Beautiful isnt it, I especially love the line about demonstrating knowledge of liable, yet failing to specify anything libellous within.  Whatever it cost, it was worth every cent.

t1_dtc7p64	1	*	It can be, I agree. I love certain aspects of reddit.  There are plenty of other parts that are a complete shit show, and a complete embarrassment.
t1_dtbzo61	1	*	Excusing something and explaining why and how something can happen are two very different things.

t1_dtbxyk6	0	*	You're acting like that was the only reason they  killed. That wasn't the only qualification. They killed to keep control. They killed political enemies. 
t1_dtcbm75	0	*	My meaning is that Siberianbataar didnt state what you claim he stated; you just made a straw man and continued to argue against it even after being advised as such.
t1_dtd9iwf	1	*	A man can't even make a smartass comment without being jumped on these days. :P In any case, Catholic tradition dating from as early as 165 CE holds Simon Peter as being the first Bishop of Rome.

t1_dtpoc8z	1	*	There is opposition, mostly from young people, most dont support this very thing.  Political parties enabling it are still voted into office though
t1_dtopl8c	1	*	All the education in the world wont make you any less afraid of the increasing rate of migrant attacks unfortunately 
t1_dtog7pn	0	*	> Theyd rather pretend it is about heritage  How do you know that it isn't?  I mean, you seem awfully certain that a very large number of people are lying about their motivations.

t1_due1x7y	0	*	Ah that's right, forgot about him. Sorry.

t1_dtopchx	0	*	Believe it or not, the rich are people too
t1_dtoxfnc	1	*	He didn't?   >Then the First Empire under Napoleon dominated Europe for 10 years, they were so dominant that even most of Europe adopted their style of military organisation. 
t1_dtosong	0	*	Additionally, the optics of slavery was a factor. Foreign powers liked the southern aristocracy type but yea all things considered they weren't worth it.
t1_dtohy21	0	*	Well, the comment you're responding to was saying that people also shouldn't be pressured not to fly it, outside of the law.  I don't think that that's a matter of legality or rights.

t1_dub49dd	0	*	What would a doctor be looking at if he/she were determining the sex of a baby before birth? An ultrasound. Would she/he be able to see a urethra in an ultrasound? No. Read better.

t1_dtuvixb	1	*	How are you going to get Assange on the plane? Do you need another 6 years to plan this escape?
t1_dtvuk73	0	*	Because I seriously don't know if you're a Russian troll. Anyway, he's the one helping corrupt politicians get in power. He clearly is helping the Republican candidates as well.
t1_dtu4073	0	*	LOL but you really like Assange....okay....
t1_dsk1k2e	0	*	But he won and so he is. Shouting take back! Do over! isn't really a governing precedent you should want to set. Stop acting like something must be done to soothe your tantrum.

t1_dtf48wy	0	*	Ok guy.

t1_dv2f91a	1	*	What is? Global News? It is a national organization in Canada. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_News
t1_dv2u0pz	1	*	Some garbage about Fox news blaming a Muslim for shooting defensively to take down a neonazi attacker shooting up a mosque in the above hypothetical scenario. Absolute drivel and nonsense.
t1_dv2czd7	0	*	You only validate thier bullshit by responding to it. And create a comment chain. Just downvote and move on. These trolls are a problem but when you engage a troll they win. DO NOT FEED THE TROLLS.

t1_dujnvq6	0	*	You don't think that any political campaign is trying to manipulate people?
t1_dujsjv1	0	*	Trump worked directly with Russia. 
t1_duknr4a	0	*	I get that but you missed my point. Even if Apple moves here it will import components not made here for their phones. So that import tax wouldnt work out for them 
t1_dulcqte	0	*	You'll even support ISIS or Iran? Because they're anti-socialist? Also, not sure what socialism has to do with anything.
t1_duk3s7l	0	*	There's sources to prove me right, but *you* need to look for them! Not me!  Burden of proof is... on you to prove **you** right, not on me.
t1_dujn31k	0	*	those are the tweets from the article.  I'm on mobile too.
t1_dujp51l	0	*	No, I'm just not American.   We have a thing called democracy over here in Europe.   
t1_dukh44x	0	*	You asked what makes it different. Because Trump is a Russian agent. 
t1_duk8x38	0	*	That's my point 
t1_duk312p	0	*	Clearly. You've been scratching your tonsels long enough you've apparently given yourself brain damage. 
t1_duk46bl	0	*	Did I mention Jimmy Carter? 
t1_duklnz2	1	*	Nah....
t1_dujss8w	0	*	You're insane. I said nothing about politifact. Is this how all Trump supporters work? They make up an opposing view and then argue against it?

t1_dujr7qb	0	*	lmao, never once used polifact. But ok, keep projecting. You know some people look at and read many sources for news. I'm sure you branch away from Fox every now and again right?
t1_duluuip	0	*	You need some sort of definition, otherwise you could apply the word to anything. Xilpaxim said that the lady was evil because she thinks she's telling the truth. Is that evil?
t1_dukh2dz	1	*	This I do not know.  I believe she could mocap for a brush they could add in post.
t1_dujk1jh	0	*	I'm sorry about your stupidity which led to you misinterpreting the paragraph you have cited hopelessly two times now.  Complete and utter moron.  
t1_dukbyga	0	*	How about when Trump mocked gold star families. Or how about when trumped mocked a disabled reporter, or how about when he wanted a 'muslim ban' I'm sure no American Muslims were insulted by that. 
t1_duk212m	0	*	I voted third party. I was sick of the hype after 8 years of Obama. 
t1_dukat2l	0	*	Neither me or the previous poster said that. What he did say is that red states are less intelligent statistically.
t1_dukqbi6	1	*	It's not always easy, but I try and keep a positive outlook. Thanks for the reading recommendations, I'll definitely check out Zeihan!
t1_dujk12n	0	*	So you want to make it unconstitutional for the Democrats to lose?
t1_dujy8r2	0	*	I love capitalism.  I don't want us to be anything like Socialist Russia.
t1_dtjo4qh	0	*	So true.
t1_dtji5pi	1	*	What? You started out not making sense and are getting even less coherent now.
t1_dtj6vbn	0	*	Would you give your son the pain and fear of large needles for vaccines despite herd immunity?  I bet you would, as would I.  
t1_dtj9hhy	0	*	That's not what I argued for at all, I'm merely pointing out the fact that for really really lazy/nasty people it's a somewhat working solution.
t1_dtjjheh	0	*	no sane person would do this when they're 18 lmao  Just to be clear, what is your stance on abortions?
t1_dtnyxmu	1	*	Not in denmark, their medical authorities have said that it is unethical except where there is pressing medical need or an adult chooses it for himself. 
t1_dtj6211	0	*	I am not forcing others to chop off their foreskin. But I will get my son circumcised. He's my son, not your's or the governments.  
t1_dtkhr3e	0	*	Sounds like a conspiracy theory made up on /pol/.
t1_dtj6prb	0	*	Nah if it waa the same shit that i already got sliced off i wouldnt mind at all.
t1_dtjkvs6	1	*	I'm not saying you're defending it just putting some facts out there.
t1_dtjie6l	0	*	That's just false. Parents should not be allowed to mutilate their children
t1_dtix4qe	0	*	I'm just imagining you and your inability to see the fact that you were mutilated by the very people that forced you to exist and who owe you a life of minimal suffering, flapping in the breeze. 
t1_dtl24zh	0	*	Good god you are an awful troll
t1_dtj19s0	0	*	One you would remember, the other you wouldn't. That answers your question of what difference does remembering make? 
t1_dtj8zab	0	*	Once again, if you could read, you would have read my comments stating clearly that I don't think circumcision for all is ethical, but it works for me. You jump to conclusion after conclusion. 
t1_dtjznat	1	*	Yeah I know belief is required but I don't understand why.  Belief in the unknowable is a strange  test or method  it requires no morality  no goodness. I guess nobody does.
t1_dtj8al1	0	*	Hypothetically, we will be able to grow a fetus inside an [artificial womb.](http://www.businessinsider.com/baby-lamb-fetus-inside-artificial-womb-2017-4) 
t1_dtjjstc	1	*	Well, that's what happens when your country is largely founded by religious zealots who were trying to escape oppression in Europe. Australia got prisoners, we got the religious nuts. Joy.

t1_dtjzvd1	0	*	You had to check back because you are obsessive.

t1_dt52tj7	0	*	Alright...? Palestinians are getting their own vouchers from every concerned country around the globe. Maybe they should look at themselves and ask where the money is.
t1_dt1b6fd	0	*	Im just telling you how it is. 
t1_dt197z8	0	*	Well I don't know? Republicans had 8 years to go after Hillary and the Dems had less then 2 years to go after Trump. Mueller is a Republican by the way. He's indicted 4 people already.  
t1_dt1a8hf	0	*	You believe presidents control the economy with their magic tweets, apparently.  Thats some lol worthy material.
t1_dt163ug	0	*	No one calls it the trump tower. 
t1_dt19s8w	0	*	Obama and his admin gave you that economy, by leading the recovery from the credit meltdown.

t1_dv21uaj	1	*	I don't like being labeled. I disagree with many points of the liberal cause, so therefore I don't want to be lumped in and have my motives assumed.
t1_dv0t5ph	1	*	> I'd wager they're actually less crowded than yours  Could very well be. It just sounded like it from your description.
t1_dv1wcrw	1	*	Tell it like it is, brother. 
t1_dv0a7ut	0	*	That's not even remotely true.  Very little of the gun industry is federally or consistently policed. What few regulations are in place are filled with loopholes. 
t1_dv0dll3	1	*	I just wanted to let you know that i got your archer reference and I appreciate it
t1_dv64bfq	1	*	Parks require up keep
t1_dv0bmtu	1	*	I know it is a meme. I just thought it stupid to go from a neutral word to another neutral word just because one is a meme word.

t1_dv03j7y	0	*	wat? What if people want to identify as a certain gender? What kind of question is that even? What if a question mark wants to identify as an exclamation mark!

t1_dulk393	0	*	British army ranks are usually very well paid, officers especially. And the Royal Navy should be popular for recruitment given the two new supercarriers

t1_dteerhk	0	*	No bc u quoted him. Now u have a different quote and ur saying that's what u were talking abt
t1_dteemc2	1	*	If you say that's not your intent then so be it. But that's the way it's coming off.

t1_dugi850	0	*	Obama was a good speaker and well poised.  That was it.  Burnie should have deified his garbage party and ran against them. He could have reformed them instead of them being pathetic socialists. 
t1_dsn6mrh	0	*	Im telling you bud.  Take a nap.  Change into a fresh new diaper.  Youll be a lot less cranky.  Maybe even able to come up with some coherent thoughts.

t1_dsmu4fc	1	*	Most American food does not even involve cheese...
t1_dsmkl5y	0	*	Please, no personal attacks. You can attack an idea, but not someone's person. For example, your idea is stupid is fine, but calling someone an ad hominem as you have is not ok.
t1_dsmtk83	0	*	And used in the FATE series. 
t1_dsnjocf	0	*	Who is third? Isn't it France, Japan, someone, and then apparently Germany?
t1_dsq4c1z	0	*	Thank you. They each get one vote.  Now tell me what that has to do with my comment regarding crushing global wealth inequality.
t1_dsmxsj4	1	*	It's similar because Redskin is a pejorative term for native Americans.

t1_dsmu8eh	1	*	who said anything about americanized italian?
t1_dsn5cak	0	*	If you want to be rigid like that, kind of? There are also people on the hermaphrodite spectrum. And I see no problem with anyone identifying how they want to. It seems silly to me to care. 
t1_dsoi93y	0	*	Gee I'll get right on that. Let me just pour some citric acid from my citric acid faucet
t1_dsmyw91	0	*	Having good restaurants doesn't mean your country's cuisine is good. Not that I don't agree; French food is notoriously good.
t1_dsnbhgd	0	*	None of this is an argument.
t1_dsnmlb9	1	*	What exactly are you babbling about? Nothing relevant to this thread, for sure.
t1_dsmpc7r	0	*	Calling someone an idiot is hurting their feelings but not illegal. Therefore hurting someone's feelings is not illegal. This isn't a difficult concept.

t1_dtzt7cv	0	*	Pretty much all doctors and alchemists from the 1700s were equally retarded.
t1_dtyvzaf	0	*	As someone with a chronic disease I completely agree. Doctors just prescribe medication and perform surgery when medication stops working, or the harmful side effects cause different problems. 
t1_dtyvxmc	0	*	This is so overwhelmingly ignorant and specific that Im genuinely curious how you came to this conclusion. 
t1_duv1rb7	0	*	Exactly, not every single one. + So in your opinion those people (the athletes who didnt) should pay for it?
t1_ds3sfvv	0	*	Youre right. Trumps an asshole to want an end to the North Korean regime, and for Pakistan to stop supporting terrorists.   What an irredeemable, self absorbed prick. 
t1_dtqdp89	0	*	You are unsurprisingly willfully pretending to misunderstand everything I say so Im done here. Your views are barbaric.

t1_ds4jeda	0	*	No, it really isnt, Trump is not a dictator, he doesnt run the government on his own, hes got people telling his Cheeto filled brain whats what.

t1_dsfpl63	0	*	They were camps, where people were concentrated. Whats misleading about that? 
t1_ds4mvvg	1	*	Certainly anyone who knew about it. At the time they were weighing Trump against Hillary, however. After Trump won, any legitimate justification for supporting him disappeared.

t1_ds46amx	0	*	Lmao you think that's a win when you just got proven wrong. 
t1_ds73tis	1	*	Yuuup and it's a long sustained pattern of behavior, not an isolated comment.
t1_ds45ocf	0	*	Strongmen don't rule by intelligence, they rule by power. It especially helps when you don't have to follow any laws and literally create the laws as you see fit, as is the case in North Korea. 
t1_ds4j3qu	1	*	This is a good idea, but i think you at least need to size each block so that it encompasses the same number of voters.

t1_ds4yvrd	0	*	In the way that Im getting to keep more of the money that I earned.

t1_dv45qvd	0	*	Look at yesterday's stock market
t1_dvg4qw8	1	*	Hero? Lol you live in a fantasy world.  Market has been going up for years buddy.  Do your research.  The ripples of these tariffs will have negative effects.  
t1_dv26687	1	*	Exactly.  You said it better than I did.
t1_dv2zptk	1	*	There is pandering and then there is dehumanizing, patronizing, tokenism. His behaviour is the latter. 
t1_dv1vru7	0	*	Yes, Paul Ryan is responsible for executive actions on tariffs. Got it.

t1_dt0i9ey	0	*	Nope, too lazy for that. I just think before I shout Burn the witch!
t1_dt0nqc7	1	*	Oh that I can agree with, the system needs to be streamlined. Just look at China, they don't fuck around.
t1_dt0j1g9	0	*	Do those people really exist? Humans have no super powers. You can imprison somebody with no risk for society. 
t1_dt2gb7l	1	*	I wrote it in a more pleasantly sounding manner but yes. I have little sympathy for the people who gassed the Kurds and later willingly joined the Islamic state.
t1_dt0iu4w	0	*	You are welcome.
t1_dt0rnj2	1	*	I did not decide what are human rights. Check the UN website. 
t1_dt0nazy	0	*	There was nothing obtuse there. I accepted your points and directly challenged them in a clear manner.  If you've got nothing in response, just be honest about it.
t1_dt0rmtg	0	*	That's the exact same reason Hitler used to purge the Communists and Socialists in 1933.
t1_dt0k71v	0	*	Of course I can. And a fun fact: This IS law in Germany. The Courts see it that way, the politicians see it that way and the majority of the population sees it that way. 
t1_dt0i6le	0	*	I do not even have a tumblr account.  To who do Human Rights apply then? People you like only?

t1_dugb2kk	1	*	Haha yeah I guess you're right
t1_duglscm	1	*	Right, I'm not sure what your point is though. It could be the 3,000th most populated and still be a city in some areas.
t1_dugzk2p	0	*	Yo, I was not talking with respect to the USA  I was talking with respect to Israel. :|

t1_dtzkg0n	1	*	I was eating a lot of coconut because it came in these fruit and nut mixes that I really liked.  And also I was using it for cooking oil.  Honestly I didn't feel that healthy.
t1_du10otj	1	*	You don't need chorizo to live! You can easily choose not to eat it and instead eat something else cheap.
t1_du4x19p	0	*	So I guess the only solution is to destroy all the immoral carnivorous animals to protect the herbivorous animals. That would be the moral thing to do.
t1_du07u9d	0	*	You might be animal for sure.
t1_dtzxmqx	1	*	Well, yeah, if you're going to be a picky baby about your food, then it'll be harder no matter what.  You're also aware that more foods have protein other than just meat and beans, right?
t1_dtzljet	0	*	> Strawmanning doesnt look good on you.  ? That's not what a strawman is
t1_dtzp6wj	0	*	Honestly, I doubt the plants that youre eating want to die either. Maybe you should just stop eating altogether?
t1_du2xey1	0	*	Do you eat meat from farms?
t1_dtznsgw	0	*	How does a wolf kill a rabbit without having a mental breakdown? It's part of nature I guess, you have more care for your own species.
t1_du0ej0l	0	*	I meant more how did you cope with one 'type of meal' every day? 
t1_dtzjt2s	0	*	Suffering for the animal. It's just unneccessary.   But that's just my view, not trying to force it but enjoying discussing these things
t1_dtzmavd	0	*	Source?
t1_dtzlt7h	0	*	I'm not a hypocrite. I'm just stating the obvious. **Of course** cruel farming practices are outliers. If I tell you grass is green, do you need me to source that too?
t1_du0g5e0	0	*	Cringe
t1_du0dtuh	0	*	Please explain where ive gone wrong lol. Just because you and 5 other imbiciles dont understand. 
t1_dtzuor3	1	*	What is your argument?
t1_dtzk71x	1	*	I know that. That, I think, does not make the first sentence any more readable.
t1_dtzwtuv	1	*	That's how I took it when I started! :)  After a while (about a month) my body adjusted pretty well to beans.
t1_du0cq2o	0	*	And if youre being fasecious and using humans to counter my argument then its moot as humans can communicate with language which is variable that changes what were talking about
t1_du06ij8	0	*	Vegan. Specifically attacking vegans, vegetarians, through both advertising and press. Specifically attacking vegan alternatives to their products such as just Mayo, plant milks and soy products.
t1_dtzvubw	0	*	You inspire me
t1_dtzlgza	0	*	Good point

t1_dtznw2q	0	*	I must admit, constantly shifting eco-villages sounds like hell to me. I agree with your other points though. 
t1_dtzrw2x	1	*	I too enjoy false dichotomies and strawmen. We should hang out more and we can learn logic together. 
t1_du06euq	0	*	Availability of land is an issue. There's constantly articles in the news with disputes over land for grazing. It's a tale as old as America too.
t1_du07xd2	0	*	Are you suggesting that other animals besides us have culture? Because what you are doing looks a lot like moving goal posts.

t1_du0225s	0	*	It was a humorous way of saying I dont need an excuse or justification really.
t1_dtzz0hd	0	*	Yeah, I'm not trying to turn this into one of those what if discussions. I was just curious what you thought of a situation like that. 
t1_du002k3	0	*	Dont care. However, humans have the capability to kill animals quickly, even more so than carnivores. In a way, humans eating animals is more ethical than animals eating animals.
t1_dtzxant	1	*	I don't see your actual argument here? Its just easy to say moral relativism exists, when that's clearly not the case.
t1_dtzypk0	0	*	Carnivores as in non humans? You know as well as I do that is a completely different case. What about people with no relatives or friends? They serve no purpose.
t1_du0lwjo	1	*	No joke, my home internet is like $60 for 50 Mbps and at work we pay something like $4k for 200 Mbps 
t1_dtzsb2r	0	*	You are so invested in upholding a picture perfect animal factory farming that I don't know what to say besides it makes me think you have some financial or moral conflict of interest.

t1_du040kr	1	*	I do hate to break it to you but government regulation doesnt qualify as totalitarian
t1_du017k6	1	*	But again... you didn't address any of the *currently perfectly legal* practices that are used on farms, such as debeaking. There's no way to take that shit out of context.
t1_du07k4a	0	*	Why would I?
t1_du0a9z7	0	*	But no not oh well you can't just say oh well like what everybody else does has no effect on the outcome you want. Ya, know?

t1_dtn7my2	1	*	for things they did not related to the campaign lol look at the indictments 
t1_dtni66k	0	*	why are you even responding? you're just mentally masturbating your pathetic biases that have nothing to do with anything in this thread except your own ignorant preoccupations

t1_dtc9ygb	1	*	That is a series of excellent points and from what I know of Putin, extremely accurate.  
t1_dtb71qb	1	*	...I might.
t1_dtazk1x	1	*	No thats not the worst. The worst is oh sorry, I didnt mean to take that much. Every. Time.
t1_dtbbn3g	1	*	So much gold .-.

t1_dtb22lc	1	*	Yeah, but she didn't know she was on camera.  That's why Frank is such a dick.

t1_dtmui2r	0	*	> putting 65% of the population into poverty  That's blatant bullshit. You're a waste of time.
t1_dtlntus	0	*	His account is less than a month old and most of his comments are pro-Trump trolling. This is what a Russian propaganda effort looks like in real time.
t1_dtk8kra	1	*	You aren't listening to me, but I'm happy to give you a place to post the messages you are writing.  I appreciate your comment, and I support you.
t1_dupqrav	1	*	Wow, what amazing insight. 
t1_dutw3rt	1	*	> What's wrong with pink hair?  nothing. do your thing.
t1_dt9tghi	0	*	The scare forced the evacuation. The radiation coming from Fukushima was minimal. A man went into the core and is fine.
t1_dt82vl6	1	*	Even if that is the case the analogy sucks at refuting it. It is a bad analogy. I award you negative analogy points. May Miller have mercy on your soul.
t1_dt878w8	0	*	american university education is world class. it's the K-12 that needs work.
t1_dt8ta6p	0	*	>It seems to me there's a new concensus however.  The study showing up in newspapers does not mean there's a new consensus. Comprehensive peer review is how you approach a new consensus. 
t1_dt7xoyl	0	*	Yep. Human curiosity is way too strong: What if they hid some super power/weapon/doughnut there instead?
t1_dt81qy8	0	*	By design to make more money. Educational industrial complex. 
t1_dt818rb	0	*	Ah, so the safety systems were there, but the procedures were not in place. 
t1_dtb28si	0	*	I suppose. But Ethereum is more of a blockchain tech than a strict crypto currency. I guess it depends on your definition.

t1_dsqtypa	0	*	You're now unable to do what's demanded by the load - which is the whole point of an electrical grid.
t1_dtdqa2h	1	*	The issue is that you arent talking about stuff thats abandoned you are talking property that you arbitrarily determine isnt used enough which is very different 
t1_ds3fts6	0	*	You haven't presented a single shred of evidence supporting your claims, ergo you have not educated me.  Your word means nothing without evidence supporting it.   Good luck.
t1_dsz4jzt	0	*	And yet it's safer. Crazy how it do dat.
t1_dszbmtz	0	*	As opposed to yours, yes they are.       Ironically I only used your arguments to highlight their stupidity.   
t1_dsz9gy7	0	*	Ye its like saying to a retard that he has down syndrome, thats not criticism
t1_dsza9ai	1	*	Good to know.  I appreciate the info.

t1_dt3mqpm	1	*	They're salaried positions. There's no overtime. 
t1_dt1d7ud	0	*	Because those are the only two options. Either the government or fat cat CEOs. I trust the government more. 
t1_dsz5ohj	1	*	Different levels of acceptability I guess.  If my kid needs surgery in 30 days and it takes 93 Im not ok with that.  
t1_dsza1jo	0	*	Black and poor people don't count as Americans according to him.  
t1_dszvlac	1	*	how clever

t1_dszb09x	0	*	What an insanely arbitrary and meaningless goalpost. Also, you treat policies like religion. There is nothing they can't change if the willpower is there. 
t1_dsz4jhq	0	*	Good to know every country other than the USA is El Salvador
t1_dsz5ctg	0	*	The part where you seem to be missing the point entirely, repeatedly. Do you want to make one more attempt at getting it here or should I just shut your nonsense down now?

t1_dszx1er	0	*	Is that what this says?   [asha.org](www.asha.org/Advocacy/state/StateTeacherCredentialingRequirements/) 
t1_dszaoj3	0	*	So the healthcare isn't actually preventing people from dying?
t1_dtrb0hs	0	*	There are other candidates that can be put on the ballot, legally. I can even write one in. There's plenty of complaints about the US electoral system, but it's still an open system.
t1_dtqzfza	1	*	You talk like experiences are objectively true, when they are in fact not.
t1_dtr4bnz	0	*	> But at least in the US, its hard for Chinese students to find jobs to stay.  How does that counter what I said? Does that not imply that they find it difficult to acquire a job and thus move back?
t1_dtqvrc2	1	*	Maybe,  I just looked up my Alma mater and they're just charging out of state to international students. But that's not how it's done where I work now.
t1_ds47bk4	0	*	The incredible changes around us. Dude you should learn to read.  Plus Im not sure how you can change the situation when the other side is unwilling to negotiate.
t1_du0ern3	0	*	I feel like you're asking for an extended essay on the details of comparative healthcare. I suggest you do some research if you're interested.
t1_dtu53qh	0	*	Name me one fascistic thing any of those people who aren't Hitler did. Also. You're going to need to back up the claim that less than 5% of non-rural people voted for Trump.
t1_dts7dj3	1	*	Charlie Gard, and waitlisted are real...
t1_dttzdmq	1	*	I agree that it's dumb... 
t1_dtsn39w	0	*	I'm not a Trump voter or supporter btw. I'm just pointing out your strategy here hasn't worked and won't work and is counter-productive.
t1_dtsxtfw	0	*	No it wasn't, the US didn't have a specially high dying rate comparing to other countries at those times.
t1_dtwq35i	0	*	Man, you Poles really are a bitter bunch. Just admit that you hate Jews! We all know it already. 
t1_dtvjsjl	1	*	Whos to say you and your kid arent next?   These people just busted down your countrys door and rounded up millions of Jews.  Why would I believe them if they told me I was safe?
t1_dttuu44	1	*	Wow, way to say that you know some good token Jews, yikes. I feel sorry for them. 
t1_dsi99zv	0	*	Google the MiG-28 incursion, and the US Navy pilot Lt Pete Mitchell.   Edit: silly of me to forget he was Navy, given the aircraft carriers etc.
t1_dsic5t1	0	*	Over being butthurt over a tan suit?  Yup.  You morons give so much shit to the left being triggered but you guys are set off easier than anyone
t1_dsi6rh0	1	*	Still shitty. Even on the second try.   You're not as rattled as you should be to suck as bad as you do. 
t1_dsilrtq	0	*	So a hot foreign wife qualifies to be president. That sounds about right. He's a proven lying con man and you got conned.
t1_dsiddqy	1	*	Resembles the Su-47 you say? Yea, both are black, but the MiG-28 is just an F-5 Freedom Fighter that someone drenched in paint. 
t1_dsipc9x	0	*	I'm not looking at the occasional user.  I'm looking at threads on the front page and top comments on them.
t1_dsj53f0	1	*	Your point?
t1_dsl980e	1	*	Wanna fucking bet? 
t1_dsillli	0	*	The nuclear bombs saved possibly *millions* of Japanese and American lives from a drawn out conflict on the mainland. War is shit, but that was probably the best end that we could have got.
t1_dsieot3	0	*	I'm sorry that fulfilling the right to protest garbage policy and abject criminal corruption scares you so much.
t1_dsiiohu	1	*	Dont forget all tube electronics. Could fly right through a nuke blast and all the other planes would drop from EMP, but they'd keep on keeping on. 
t1_dsi7rsj	1	*	An 'extremely credible source' has already verified for me that it's false. Not going to spoon feed you either
t1_dsk5gg0	0	*	Because you seem to continue claiming they were the same when the there was 2 years between when one stopped and the other started. 
t1_dsizf5p	1	*	True.  Thats a tall order.
t1_dsia62x	1	*	Pretty sure thats what I was doing. You just said the same thing I said. 
t1_dssiyod	1	*	Well that's if one cares... In my case I just say what I want to say and move on with my day 
t1_dt1aiml	1	*	What a stupid excuse for a double standard. Did the definition of sexism change? Or does it change every election?
t1_dso2nge	0	*	I agree they target both Israel soldiers and civilians.   Thankfully they are relatively bad at both.
t1_dt94gvv	0	*	Yeah, I would agree that he isn't a failure, but I also don't think that fact should be lauded. 
t1_dt8tczn	0	*	Dude, I'm subbed to r/the_donald r/politics and r/latestagecapitalism trust me I get the spectrum.
t1_dt9gib0	1	*	Determining truth isn't easy, yes.
t1_dt8upht	0	*	So name one then. 
t1_dt96069	0	*	That's the sort of stability I've come to expect from genius Trump supporters.  Endorsing the murder of their fellow citizens.  Shouldn't you be busy driving a car into a crowd of innocent protesters?
t1_dt90sue	1	*	You guys are bringing the world together. And it's beautiful.
t1_dt9189x	0	*	My point was more that the sub is willing to accept unverifiable and unreliable info so long as it fits their biases. 
t1_dt905s1	0	*	You're still talking about Hillary... Get a fucking life. 
t1_dt8x378	1	*	Lol you've gotta be a troll. Almost got me man :p
t1_dt9p9lf	1	*	Haha thank you! :-)
t1_dt8vqxi	1	*	I'm indeed not okay with hate speech, but I'm not in favour of making it illegal. And I'm just pointing out that you're indeed being a hypocrite. Not surprising though.
t1_dt92jpo	0	*	That's another good one. Bonus if he got it a ~~dredlock~~ afro wig to wear.   edit: hairstyles
t1_dt96o58	0	*	Militaries and militias aren't the same.  The National Guard is a militia, but the regular military is not.
t1_dta8pdz	1	*	What can I say, I like my guns.
t1_dtauwj3	1	*	Could be! Big if true.
t1_dt8vysr	0	*	When they bought that scam, I was laughing so hard. When that guy tried it on Shark Tank, Mark Cuban just said, Im allergic to scams.
t1_dt9kawv	0	*	Oh my mistake, I didn't realize I was speaking to a saint
t1_dt8uwsv	1	*	I'm still waiting for my letter :'(
t1_dt9ne6n	0	*	because otherwise you would know riot control actually escalates tensions. unless you consider beating pacific marching students as a de escalation
t1_dt8utrq	0	*	Please sir, may I have some more raven scraps?
t1_dt96kuh	1	*	The keyword is 'new'. And 1988 was 30 years ago.  The rules have been dumb for 250 years and have always been used to rig the system in one way or another.
t1_dt9u2lh	0	*	The only one who looks like a mug here is you. Primary school tactics of E-e-erm I was just guessing!!! You didn't make me look!!  So funny.
t1_dt9h2w7	0	*	Again, I am surprised you are bothered by that considering how much you peopld love safe spaces.
t1_dt9wyqf	1	*	She was replaced with Sara Blakely allegedly because she's younger and more attractive. 
t1_dt94b1n	0	*	Hahaha, my hero Donnie Cheeto supports paedophiles and wants to bang his own flesh and blood!  hahaha?  You're okay with it though, I see.  I hope you don't have kids of your own.
t1_dt95ig0	0	*	> youre taking the word of 1 man over things that have now been verified  yes, I'm taking the word of the former FBI director under oath.. and you're taking the word of an anonymous source. 
t1_dt92x4g	0	*	It doesn't matter how much money you have, if it's a financial decision you can be as picky as you want. If you're poor you should probably be even pickier.
t1_dtb8gk2	0	*	That's not what a strawman, a fact, legacy, or insanity is. And it's plummeting. Two Ms, just like the Golden Arches you gorge yourself to death at while watching conspiracy theories.
t1_dv3au58	1	*	You found me!
t1_dt90yuw	0	*	Did you read the article you posted? Its not exactly a big win. 
t1_dta70fr	1	*	Were you in a hoop jumping competition at the time?  I just went online and clicked a button after logging in.
t1_dta3tv2	1	*	>Because in Modern grammar that second comma would be a semi colon.  And the other commas?
t1_dt9dkmc	0	*	But it makes every sour candy delicious. 
t1_dt9vanf	1	*	High-fives all around. *I* think we're smart ;)

t1_dt8uuq0	0	*	By who? And is the thing she saying being verified by multiple sources?  If so then yes I believe your grandmother. 
t1_dt9zymo	0	*	What counts as proof in your eyes?
t1_dt8z5fw	1	*	I'm not talking illuminati I'm talking parties, generals and businesses  
t1_dt8wyvl	1	*	If only they were free from acid attacks and vehicles driving through people.   Its the price you have to pay for actual freedom. I'm sorry but I don't support athoritarian practices.
t1_dt93wwd	0	*	I can tell we disagree politically but I hope that stuff works out for you, man. Life's hard. I got doctors bills, my insurance covered most of it thankfully, but it still stresses me out. 
t1_dt9m75l	0	*	Why do you believe that Clinton is a terrible person?
t1_dtjw97i	0	*	Oh sweetheart, I know the concept of extrapolation is hard for short bus kids like yourself but that's okay! Youre just stupid you can't help it.
t1_dt8scte	1	*	Yeah it's curious Bernie didn't run as an independent, can't recall exactly why. Perhaps party loyality, didn't want to impact Hilary's chance.
t1_dtx3rs6	0	*	So again I ask what would I learn if I went to Denmark? And Im tellin ya you can get your message across better without being rude to people. 
t1_dtyi4o4	1	*	1 sets a very dangerous precedent. For the same reason you laid out in reason 2. political weaponry. thats the whole argument of the right and purpose of the memo.
t1_du2bidt	1	*	Dude now you're stalking my shit? On a sat night? LMAO i can tell you get no wet 
t1_dty4s54	0	*	You said they'd be forced to change their political/economic systems 3 comments above this one.
t1_dtx80ih	0	*	You do realize that they lied to the FBI about Russian contacts with the campaign, right? And that they took plea deals, right? And that I asked how many arrests your side has, right? 
t1_du8y83t	1	*	How does a wet blanket pick something apart? I mean a blanket doesn't even have thumbs, wouldn't it sort just drape over top and hold the whole thing down? 
t1_dtxnju2	0	*	I wouldn't say I'm okay with it, but so long as it doesn't come with mistreatment of employees then I'm not hung up on it either
t1_dtysb7p	0	*	Why are you still arguing about IT/computers when that was not a part of my initial statement? Did you read the link I posted?
t1_dtwyka4	0	*	Eehhhh they're doing what? With something that has the same penalties as schedule I? And you can prove you've done it with a hair test for a while after?
t1_dtyu7bx	0	*	A democracy is not a physical object, try again.
t1_dtzoai6	1	*	How is the IRS all encompansing? 
t1_dtyewhh	1	*	The goons born in the 90s are growing up fast.
t1_dtx6h2o	1	*	So, Bush and co lied about what the agencies said once. Now let us never again trust anything they ever say, even if it's regarding national security and democratic elections.
t1_du0w27l	0	*	Your logic doesn't work unless you think the people who bought in January of 2017 profitted off of the misfortune of people who bought in June. That is just not how any of this works. 
t1_dud5kq3	0	*	Right apparently it's paranoia to think Russia spams social media in a thread about Russia doing that 
t1_dud44a8	1	*	Inspired by you <3
t1_dudibq8	0	*	Again thanks for confirming you haven't actually read it or the rebuttals to it.
t1_ducxb5s	0	*	Hmm.  Fair enough - You've made it become clear that skepticism ropes wayyyyy too many things under it's umbrella for it to be debated upon.  skeptic if you do, skeptic if you don't
t1_dudjznj	0	*	Ok. Now we are going to switch to tacos and all of their accoutrements.
t1_dudkukr	1	*	Good one.
t1_dudhxw4	1	*	as I already mentioned 2 times, no.     Its about the type of content and lack of opposition not the subject of content, its a completely one sided echo chamber
t1_dudk4vn	0	*	In referring to the primaries, the thing you said was rigged.   And his win differential was no more than 60,000 in 5 key states. 
t1_duesdj8	0	*	Obama never lied. Good fucking one.
t1_dud51b9	0	*	> I still work for the US Gov.  No you don't.
t1_dud52kn	1	*	Hahahaha is this a serious question? What point are you trying to make here? Crimes happen all the time that don't result in someone's immediate arrest.
t1_dud31j2	0	*	Thanks for admitting you spammed my messages 
t1_ducrixd	0	*	Ok, and you don't see any difference there? 
t1_ducwnd0	0	*	Huh.  Interesting.  Man, this is like when I found out my favorite brand of paper towels was owned by the Koch Brothers.  Nothing is safe.
t1_ductv5u	0	*	I can see you do not intend to understand my position. I hope blindly insulting people makes you happier than it annoys me, just for utility's sake.
t1_dudkrgg	0	*	Do you not know how to use Google? I gave you instructions above genius. Ask mom to stop making your bed for 5 seconds and type in the words for you.  Proof, lol, you liberals are adorable.
t1_ducyqiy	0	*	That's quite a more specific statement than you claimed.  That does not say there was no collusion that occurred at all during the campaign as you implied.
t1_ds2496n	0	*	Ending the occupation isn't really an option, nobody else is willing to take over control over the area, and the talks with the PA are just an endless line of complete failure.
t1_dt0kfzo	1	*	If it was only that he wanted to do.... (but I wont say more before I'm called a conspiracy nut).  People will say it is, I guess....It's like no one has read the two sides of the story. 
t1_dt1uyme	0	*	Ohhh! Well, thank you for clearing that one up. :/   Edit: Currently learning for the organisation management exam and this dude just popped up. What a coincidence. 
t1_dt14klr	0	*	You mean the plane that was shot down or something like that, that even the victim's families called a charade?
t1_dt0k2tm	0	*	Ah ok so it is a religious conflict. At least partly. That's sad.
t1_dt13dj2	1	*	I came, I saw, he died
t1_dt0x4br	0	*	It's also spot on, as Crimea proves.
t1_dt0uwk4	1	*	Oh not at all. It is working as intended.
t1_dt0jii0	0	*	I don't think he knows that.
t1_dt0m40a	0	*	Destroying water treatment facilities and various other vital infrastructure that civilians require to survive sure sounds like terrorism to me. 
t1_dt0yqzj	0	*	Getting involved with Vietnam was France's idea too, that doesn't mean that the US involvement was any less disasterous.
t1_dt0n1dm	0	*	Bitch please nothing of what you said has anything to do with refuting my point
t1_dt0pi4k	1	*	That's some mathematical gymnastics there, it's not oil bought per capita, but total oil bought. 
t1_dt0mr4e	1	*	Yes  But if we're talking coincidences.  He did have plans to start trading oil in a currency which wasn't USD, months later he was dead (Same thing happened to Iraq)
t1_dt0pj0o	0	*	Those figures are the breakdown of Saudis oil exports; they export ~twice as much to the USA as to Europe. Population isnt relevant.
t1_dt0yxsh	0	*	If we stop being imperialist, everyone else will too!
t1_dt0v27g	0	*	What the fuck are you even talking about? It was constant warfare in europe from the fall of rome until the second world war. 
t1_dt13yzf	0	*	OP was pretty clearly talking about Syria and Libya, so unless the Houthis are a *much* more effective force than I've been lead to believe, you need to pay more attention.
t1_dt0lsa5	1	*	Well before? It was some protests and some violence but it was not a full on civil war until the US and the UN got involved. 
t1_dt0o2at	1	*	Haha oh ok
t1_dt1aor8	0	*	Never heard of this, sources / more info?

t1_duk242v	0	*	I'm actually curious as I've never heard of such a culture, or it's violence. 
t1_dv0mwrh	1	*	Just STFU and keep pushing. Your 'evidence' was weak at best.
t1_dv0nxax	1	*	After you prove what you claimed is correct.
t1_dv0m067	1	*	You are an internet dweeb that doesn't understand anything. Get off and go see the world.
t1_dv0ntvk	1	*	You didn't provide anything that proved your claims, that's NOT evidence, sir.
t1_dv0ls9g	1	*	Your evidence is laughable at best. It didn't even back up what you claimed.
t1_dv0nd21	1	*	You are yet to prove your claim is true!
t1_dv0mb5u	1	*	Quit being a bitch and post evidence that backs up your claim about people of the Philippines not like Duterte, not what he said he'd do.
t1_dv0m4n8	1	*	You haven't stepped foot outside your country, stop lying. You should post evidence of what you claim or fall back, this is much bigger than you.
t1_dv0m9y8	1	*	So?
t1_dv0mywh	1	*	Provide proper evidence or gtfo.
t1_dv0ua6b	1	*	What sources? Did you read any of those sources you lame dweeb? You can't even provide evidence yet you're still talking trying to save face. Go to bed before I take away your password.

t1_dt1k16s	0	*	Yes, that is what I said. 
t1_dt17u2c	0	*	If you're calling the US a socialized state because it has police, there's really nothing for us to discuss.

t1_dsgiuf6	1	*	Thanks! I had to for health reasons, but now that I'm accustomed to it, I wouldn't change even if I could! It actually saves money. You can do it!

t1_dtij6am	0	*	Go look up polls on evangelicals and Trump by Gallup or Pew and get back to me. Or don't and continue living in your delusional safe space.
t1_dtj5p1b	1	*	So more unnamed sources and no context to actual laws. Gotcha
t1_dticx29	0	*	You are incredibly dense. 
t1_dtk7rmp	0	*	The US constitution is very explicit in it's laying out what the term means and the punishments associated. There is no wiggle room for it. Laws have their own definition.
t1_dtij738	0	*	If what?  Seriously though, your argument is that you're right because you think you are. If you can't see why that's stupid then God help you.
t1_dusqhec	0	*	Op's article...

t1_duela9v	1	*	Something about PINK and me being a Russian troll I believe
t1_dud5lpf	0	*	It says in the indictment that the Russians communicated with people from the Trump campaign.
t1_dudi4s4	1	*	>No, freedom of speech is not part of the element.  I don't know how you can say it's not part of it. No one's arguing it's the only factor, but it's still a factor.

t1_dud4awc	0	*	look up the definition of soyboy and then explain how you are not a soyboy
t1_dueo4xe	1	*	TIL expressing an opinion on Reddit is foreign interference.  The day U.S. politics stop influencing my life is the day I will stop commenting on U.S. politics.  Any questions?
t1_duddlol	0	*	So how about you provide a credible source lol.
t1_dud8cc6	1	*	> Meanwhile we keep sending troops to the Russian border  If you look at the map, US keeps sending troops to EVERYONE's borders. Thats what global empires do.
t1_dudda1l	0	*	I have little doubt that these same tactics are being used to varying degrees in pretty much any developed country you can think of, including Japan and Finland.
t1_dudbsnq	0	*	Oh really, two Abrahamic religions don't mix? That's interesting.  The Westboro Baptist Church and the Alt-Right Nazis marching in the streets are just fine though, because they're Christians, right?
t1_dudntvg	1	*	No. 
t1_dudc0jw	1	*	It's actually a really funny video where a guy reads Yahoo! answers questions that are egregiously misspelled in a dramatic fashion.   https://youtu.be/t2b3ex_NEig
t1_dufteu2	0	*	Time.. Just lean back and see
t1_dud755k	0	*	They are playing agent of chaos. That is their main intent correct? Trump would be a better facilitator of that end goal than Hillary.
t1_dud93vp	0	*	You're clearly not engaging in an actual debate (because you have no evidence or support) and just making fun of a nationality. In any other context this is ridiculous.
t1_dud4zgz	1	*	[Cya nerd, hope you sleep well tonight ;)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7Uy0Uznw4E)
t1_dudihyt	1	*	The ideals. To be clear, I'm talking about modern liberalism, not classical liberalism (which is the bomb diggity).
t1_dud6af8	0	*	He might want to expand the military but his cabinet has shown to be utterly incompetent and he is souring US relations with all of its allies.
t1_duddixo	1	*	This couldn't be more true.
t1_dudl72y	0	*	I dont share your political views thats a really sane reason to harass someone. You aren't crazy at all. Bye troll.  Reported and blocked
t1_dudk6yz	0	*	>It was an effort coordinated by the Moscow.  ^[citation ^needed]
t1_dudjkbs	0	*	This is modern warfare 101. You can't just outright declare war against a nuclear power unless they do something that would traditionally start a war
t1_dudhy3r	0	*	> The world doesnt work like this.  Of course it does. Propaganda works.
t1_dufg4we	1	*	As long as you are winning I am happy. Unless your some fool who doesn't vote in US elections but comes here to participate uselessly. 
t1_dudjv9l	1	*	No decent philosopher would ever argue for censorship. Too many of us burned at the stake for heresy.  But hey, what do I know.
t1_dudee20	0	*	Please, stop with the blatant lying. Its insulting.

t1_dud6mrb	1	*	your fantasy of impeachment is a defense mechanism that you use to prevent you from having a nervous breakdown due to the fact that DONALD TRUMP IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
t1_dudh9kt	0	*	CA vs Kansas  Is a case study of which policies actually work and how privatization of the commons doesn't serve the communities. 
t1_dudk8c6	1	*	Honestly, I could see it.  Very unlikely though. 
t1_dudkrup	0	*	Not last time I checked
t1_dudhtau	0	*	The best defense is good governance. 
t1_duddwer	0	*	Perhaps it means used by or amplified by.  You made a stupid assumption. Admit it. Not surprising given you thought I linked to a mere headline.
t1_dudij6e	0	*	You gotta stop watching FoxNews... its been documented it makes you less informed.  https://jamestown.org/program/russian-air-defense-us-strike-al-shayrat/
t1_dsztxv1	0	*	Google Dukes of Hazard  Basically the people you describe are just people aping what they think cool southern car culture is. Based off an out of date show.
t1_dua55z5	0	*	That's irrelevant to my point. I never said Putin liked any sitting US president. I was talking about the election.
t1_dv7y9bl	0	*	You cant just make up feelings as laws and demand the government follow them. 
t1_du9qejf	0	*	Lovely, more neologisms! How creative we are today!  Oh i got one too: you are a *tibetan wallpaper* and like to *brainfart*
t1_duadhnl	1	*	Come on mannn he was friends with jay-z!!! 
t1_ducerlm	0	*	This is snarky name calling rather than productive discussion. I'm sure you're a clever adult. Not much of a free thinker, tho. 
t1_du9nasm	1	*	Projecting is a bad look for you.
t1_dsgecym	0	*	Horseshit.
t1_duutb9f	0	*	So the criteria is simply to be not welcome but not commit a crime, and you are placed all in one group with no separation between any ideology that might go there?

t1_dt8b5ns	1	*	True, but I still feel guilty about using their prostitution, is there a way to get it fair trade or something.
t1_dt6o8mn	0	*	Perfect deduction, Sherlock. In actuality though, those will probably go back to the non-voter bloc where they came from.
t1_dt9gfpw	0	*	Trust me 30 percent is a lot. Once you factor in all the freebies you will get. Subsidized fuel, free college, healthcare, subsidized insurance , no property tax for 1st property etc...
t1_dt7mnsh	1	*	Do you know what Belgium did in the Congo? Or how about what the British did to the Zulu? I believe the word genocide is brought up.
t1_dt9ev49	0	*	i'm your god, not a mere 'man'. bow and suck it.
t1_dt6q4xa	0	*	First, what does that have to do with your pyramid of heads comment  And second, so that means that country B doesn't harbour any responsibility because everyone else does it?
t1_dt6nvup	1	*	> Many people argue that capitalism is the best way to achieve high productivity, therefor not an authoritarian state.  You can have a capitalist authoritarian state. That's basically what China is.

t1_du7mw8q	1	*	It's all disgusting but so is reality.
t1_du61oyv	0	*	We don't. But take your argument to the logical end. Anybody that's ever harmed someone should be locked up for the rest of their life. That's ridiculous.
t1_dudzqbh	0	*	> Finally, why should China care about US IP laws? They're not Chinese IP laws.  It was a condition for their entering the WTO which they summarily dumped as soon as it became convenient.
t1_ds5s3x2	0	*	Source 1 is a Republican propaganda outlet. Source 2 is from the Wonkblog, i.e. not real news.
t1_ds5l3ss	1	*	Hey thanks Man  Corrected
t1_ds5x5z8	0	*	I'm not calling you out at all, but do you have a source? I did a quick check on it before because I'm not familiar with it, but didn't come across anything that said it. 
t1_ds5cvwl	0	*	I love how he literally said he wasn't being emotional and then he said he was being emotional in the next comment.  Too funny
t1_ds5lnf6	1	*	True that it happened?  Or true that its illegal?
t1_ds5xjvx	0	*	Our expectations have been lowered so much that this makes sense. 
t1_ds5cair	0	*	It is their own comment, isn't it?  Maybe you should try refuting specific points instead of blindling yelling about how inaccurate you think it is.
t1_ds5rr4x	1	*	Not many. Cover-ups are every politician's bread and butter. The only time one gets punished for it is when some other politician uses it as a power play.

t1_dv3uzu9	0	*	Please provide a citation to support your fact that *black people are poor because they're dumb*.
t1_dv3umc6	1	*	Yes and that was her strategy.  It's not too say she was devoid of policy... when you spend that much money smearing your opponent via attack ads, maybe that's your strategy.
t1_dv3bejf	0	*	I never once blamed it on Russia. I just said it is propaganda.  ..guilty conscious or what?

t1_dv3jhqc	0	*	My point has already been made and you even replied indicating your understanding of it.  Moron. 
t1_dv4pe7o	1	*	A Tortoise isn't very heroic though. They consider themselves heroes and thus need a heroic animal.
t1_dv3e4md	1	*	Exactly, it's never the existence of rules that deters people from breaking them, it's the enforcement. 
t1_dv382vp	1	*	None off the top of my head, just happy to see another willing to engage in civil discourse.
t1_dv34hj4	0	*	That is definitely how percents work lol.   And no, that is a 2 month study and your extrapolating it to 2 years lol. 
t1_dv3dfq5	0	*	OP/OC said they were banned for posting in a negative sub, but further comments repeatedly say browsing. Can mods see where I lurk?
t1_dv3ia1o	0	*	The funding arrangement with HFA and the victory fund agreement was not illegal
t1_dv35w9y	1	*	For the 2018 elections? I'm not sure. I would have to see the data. Everything I've seen since Trump has been elected indicates they are 50/50 on things like BLM and gun control.
t1_dv3on2s	1	*	I just feel bad for watching the show. Sometimes it's a little tasteless.
t1_dv3l8g9	0	*	Yes it does matter, it's reality.  Sometimes you can't compromise with reality. And if one side refuses to acknowledge reality for long enough, everyone gets screwed. 
t1_dv3urka	1	*	I agree

t1_dv3fy62	1	*	Same reason you care about what other people post in a sub you supposedly dislike. 
t1_dv3b795	0	*	No.  Not at all.  The connotation you use for this idea is that it's sexist.  That the men who are sensitive are afraid of women, or what women think of them.

t1_ducw2ok	1	*	Besides, the 'roaring 20s' was 'all good', too.  Until that one day.
t1_dsfw412	1	*	I guess it's nice to look down on people that are under represented in 99% of all high paying jobs and say they are throwing a fit over it.
t1_dsfp717	0	*	>Who gives a shit if its mostly men or mostly women?  Mostly women, because they're experiencing discrimination and there's no evidence men are more suited for the role. 
t1_dsf6l68	0	*	See you in a year. 
t1_dsfgz9n	0	*	But why are they disproportionally more qualified? Might there be some kind of discrimination?
t1_dsfd4m8	1	*	Fair enough
t1_dshouh5	1	*	Your argument was mostly vague generalisations.
t1_dsf35x5	0	*	I guess I confused you... that was sarcasm ...   Thanks for the downvote, next time I'll add the /s so you understand
t1_dsf6ce9	0	*	What I meant was, would it matter if I said yes? Would you believe me? Would I be telling the truth? Claims to authority on a topic should never be trusted over the internet.
t1_dsf4wbm	0	*	the verdict is irrelevant to the argument being made, its either fair or not, regardless of legality
t1_dsf7hw0	0	*	Silicon Valley is home to the most entitled white males outside of reddit 
t1_dsxwdy5	1	*	In Abkhazia there's no chance of a suicide bomber ruining your time there. Being poor relative to the west and being a lawless state full of terrorists is kind of a big difference.

t1_dtrl9ru	0	*	> if they were underpaid they would go work somewhere else  In some towns it literally becomes pretty much the only work opportunity at all.
t1_dtrziey	1	*	Nah, I'm not that cool
t1_dtrkkqe	0	*	I've never experienced that.  From what I can tell, people who complain that the privacy settings don't work are usually the ones who don't know how to use them.
t1_dtrhv4q	0	*	Pretty much every e-commerce site has a Facebook pixel tracker embedded. They already know what you purchased, from whom and for how much.

t1_dtrkk7p	0	*	Selling below cost is generally seen as a predatory practice.  And no, they don't compete on prices nationally.  They have different prices in different regions, especially for food.

t1_dub8v2g	0	*	Why are you wasting people's time?
t1_ducfrxx	1	*	Posted as a comment to the thread with thousands of comments. I regularly bring it up tbh. It never goes over well.  Its like discussing explosions at a support meeting for people with PTSD. 
t1_dubpnqc	0	*	I did not post positive things (or much negative) because I wasnt a fan.   I saw many comments and posts that did extremely well doing so though, and had a lot of support
t1_duvvpgo	0	*	In the same way that black people die of more malaria...  sure.  That doesn't mean white people are more resistant to malaria.
t1_dudjpc3	1	*	What would you suggest instead? Regressive left? Conservative-but-with-a-different-gut-instinct? Just cunts?

t1_dtl0e1u	1	*	Have you eaten factory farmed meat? Then yes, you have.
t1_dtl5nu2	1	*	People don't care about the environment now. The difference would be a 50% reduction in environmental destruction, possibly more since we are currently at a threshold.

t1_dtl08ej	0	*	Hey, like politics!
t1_dtx9pnz	0	*	Lol so bad at context clues you came back 6 days later to misinterpret my comment. I was saying if any president could bend the rules to do the right thing, it's The Don. 
t1_dtl36jb	1	*	Seemed pretty relevant to me. They were showing the other side of the coin where people who do actually have a legitimate use for the antibiotic will be screwed once they stop working

t1_dtl7b51	1	*	Have seen. Is smart video.
t1_dtl3h16	0	*	What's the industry's role in that? If it weren't for the natural interest the industry has in controlling distribution channels I'd think drug regulations are strictly a governmental concern.
t1_dtl3wml	1	*	Well I think years of people drinking to dull the pain might disagree with you there.
t1_dtlav5f	0	*	Lol you don't want to help save the world because you don't like my attitude? There are harsh realities you need to face

t1_dthpwta	1	*	It's a documented deal Flynn was working on til June, 2016.  Alex Copson is likely the one that got him arrested. 
t1_dthdirh	0	*	Idiots who don't know anything about dementia think Trump is suffering from dementia.
t1_dtit9dr	0	*	no, you were correct.  it's just that it's a silly thing to nitpick over.
t1_dthelb8	0	*	Then why didnt you go after the dude I responded to?
t1_dthqecx	1	*	Exactly.
t1_dtis1m6	1	*	That statement was obviously not all encompassing.

t1_dtj9sfg	0	*	Again. You are incapable of understanding the point that this person was trying to make. But you think you are smart and everyone else is stupid. Bravo.
t1_dtho3at	1	*	So if I switch my flair to Somalia, does that make me a Somali propagandist?   T_D isn't like 4chan where your country flair is static.
t1_dthvciv	0	*	Thank you for at least responding with a potentially valid answer for what he meant.  But if that is the case it was taken out of context.
t1_dthanqw	0	*	No, it's because you trump supporters are so stupid you can't even quote Orwell correctly. But you are right in a sense, we would prefer all the morons go somewhere separate.

t1_dstw5cp	0	*	So you are sticking with My dad cracks down on me like China cracks down on human rights lawyers interpretation?  A bit weird, since no one says that. But if that is what you meant then so be it.
t1_dsss6v5	0	*	30 a month is not that bad for Cuba. Its better to compare Cuba to somewhere like Haiti or Jamaica. Youll find Cuba is way better for the average working man.
t1_dsiq8qc	0	*	I'm the one presenting facts. You're the one cowering in terror while denying them. You also have a terrible knowledge of geopgrahy.

t1_dshivzb	0	*	I didn't say it was illegal. Work on your reading skills.
t1_dv0lvhb	0	*	Im sorry you feel that way.  What have I misrepresented?
t1_dsnkpq6	0	*	Not exactly on those pages, but those pages can point you to some pretty good groups that will discuss those things. Beware, SJWs tend to lurk on those though.
t1_dtar8ap	0	*	It's documented that Russia were the ones who hacked them and Wikileaks published them, that's documentation that Wikileaks were part of it.   How the fuck don't you see that as demonstrably true?
t1_dthc8qp	0	*	That's a very... liberal view of that.  So the senate intelligence committee is fine to discuss their opinions (which they never do) regarding Presidential level classified information?
t1_dtgj1g4	0	*	I think all 3 million votes knew she was more in touch with the interests of voters than Trump. 
t1_dthiiay	0	*	> Respect for the Rule of Law.   You live in a dream world.  A very strange one.

t1_dtgnpfw	1	*	What the fuck. I really... I don't know how one can be THAT stupid. How do you even manage to post a comment on reddit with your amount of stupidity?  I'm horrified right now.

t1_dtic0pm	1	*	Well that's just what I mean: any actually functional democracy will protect its people's right to protest and without having them threatened with termination.
t1_dti6hw0	1	*	Falling for tradgedy of the commons is not rational.
t1_dtgni8f	0	*	What do you mean we? Your delusional. You have formed some sort of us vs them group in your head.
t1_dthhsqu	1	*	That's what reddit ancaps say but they're fuckin dumb  You can take their word for it, but then you'd be fuckin dumb too  By definition it's extreme left wing. Go read the definition

t1_dtgt0yj	1	*	This is now a Soros thread. 
t1_dtgq90o	0	*	No, it was for a bj. They were looking for any desperate thing they could accuse him of for literally decades. Republicans have always worked against america.

t1_dtgiadj	0	*	You inferred it 
t1_dtgjh0p	1	*	Yes, they are republics.  What kind of republics?  Democratic republics.
t1_dthmlwg	0	*	not the fact of him not placing sanctions but any indication that this is illegal or a crisis for constitutionality is not true. 
t1_dthdwsk	1	*	pick whatever you want, wrong either way
t1_dthl90r	1	*	I want to believe my president and his administration are doing what they can to fight corruption. Trump has done a few good things so Im sure he is doing his best in this.  But how? Source me up.
t1_dtgo1ig	0	*	What difference does spelling make? This whole Russia story, people mostly repeat what they hear on tv. Commenting on spelling is taking the easy way out. 
t1_dtgnsmv	1	*	If you say so.
t1_dtgn793	0	*	Eh, my heart failed three weeks ago. I got more problems than all this bullshit  I miss my car pictures and stupid gifs being on the front page and not this propaganda

t1_dtyu7k8	0	*	Even when it's legible it doesn't prove jack shit. You really need to get the tin foil off your head and learn the difference between reality and groupthink creating its own version of events.
t1_du0tfvg	0	*	Threaten the US?   You realize they are making progress every day right? You can't wait until someone has mad to do somthing
t1_dty9p0z	1	*	That's what I'm trying to say
t1_dtz7e16	1	*	Thanks....
t1_du1v9sq	0	*	You are the one that's asking me to believe that Trump is taking actions against Russia when there's no evidence of that and when it appears that such actions would not benefit his re-election. 
t1_dtysn3a	0	*	Yep that's what I was trying to point out.
t1_dt4wirx	0	*	And you pay too much for boof, not good for your health man
t1_dt4ybci	0	*	You didn't say anything about Europe, and the context only consisted of Greece's debt which cannot be blamed by the crisis. Keep moving the goal posts further and you might win.
t1_dtuhix6	0	*	Exactly. The perspective needs a bit of a shift.

t1_dtw087x	1	*	I lose productivity after 5 hours.  Luckily i spend enough time in meetings that I don't actually work that much. 
t1_dtx04di	1	*	Not true.   Wokers are happiest when they are challenged and are meeting those challenges.      Security only brings a small benefit. People are happier when pushing.
t1_dtdi4qq	0	*	I would laugh. But I have met people whose attitude is exactly that. I dunno how many times I've heard I don't want any help. I just wanna die.
t1_dtzsac8	1	*	yea i know
t1_du52uzr	0	*	So LGBTQ+ are the attackers and poor homophobes that try to pass legislation to give money to gay conversion therapy are the victims.  Pot. Kettle. Black.

t1_dup1n31	1	*	You're right, I've been rude. I'm sorry dude.

t1_ds2hspb	0	*	Sure, but it's not effective for that reason, but if they want to counter China in the future they need a training carrier.
t1_duiaid1	0	*	That has nothing to do with the Chinese person you're telling is wrong about their nationality. It's a non-sequitur.

t1_du49e5g	0	*	You don't think there's a mass problem of people living beyond their means, and modern society egging them on to do so?  
t1_du2qyz2	0	*	Whoosh.
t1_du2uhud	0	*	More like, he had a valid point prior to the Internet.  This data has been vulnerable and exploited for way longer than the Equifax leak.  
t1_du2hdzs	0	*	I dont really give a hot fuck about that because theyre not 1/10th as corrupt as Trump, et al.
t1_du2stgz	1	*	Lol

t1_du3x7nu	1	*	We can't expect all rich people to have every comment read to them.
t1_du2823x	1	*	It's amazing how you still haven't gotten the point.

t1_dt089d9	1	*	Well, he was average for his times. Most of the world has higher standards now.
t1_dtnhji6	1	*	Interesting outcome eh? Probably not enough to stop the Mueller probe as problem visa info wasn't  what triggered the probe. 
t1_ds137pw	1	*	for the first part, here is a [proof](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/7ncffk/woman_branded_a_hero_for_removing_hijab_during/ds1349q/)  Also I didn't start the shit-talk
t1_ds4ei6s	0	*	I don't get your analogy.  Of course they are wrong.  They are completely wrong.
t1_dud10wt	1	*	any takers?

t1_duyi8p4	0	*	I'll wait
t1_duxxolh	0	*	How about you not move the goalposts. We're not talking about all government spending. We're talking about spending on healthcare alone. 
t1_duxh86l	1	*	Thats more sad than anything.
t1_duwwvw8	0	*	Oh. So you're like cerci lannister or her dad?  You realize those are the bad guys in that story, right?

t1_dv26m6h	1	*	I worked in DC for 10 years mate... lol  Though to be fair, I don't think I had a soul when I moved there, so leaving without one was no biggie.
t1_du715zv	0	*	The whole point is that China does it to an extreme.
t1_dsf2fdy	0	*	Right, so I'm still not out of touch.  If you perceive an innocuous compliment as sexual harassment, then you are out of touch with reality.
t1_duaf94z	1	*	> You're insane.  At least tell me the reason.
t1_du6yunc	0	*	lol, the triggered response was great . didnt realize you were so sensitive but thanks for the laugh bud!   hopefully you calm down in a lil bit , little man U0001f643
t1_du6sxou	1	*	>Timur  Ah, it all makes sense now. You probably believe the slush puddle you stepped in last week was a plant by a Kremlin double-agent.
t1_du8jmh6	0	*	I think they are only moderate rebel terrorists when the US supports them. 
t1_du7ak2v	1	*	Them too. There were a lot who paid the ultimate price for the imbecility of others. 
t1_du6yxz8	0	*	It's a joke really, though DT's love of Vlad fuels rumours that Vlad has him trained/on a leesh
t1_duac3lf	1	*	If you state something you must be able to prove it. Thats how debate works. If i say 2+2=5 i have to prove why it equals 5. The person im telling isnt supposed to prove im right.

t1_dtiwede	1	*	Let me guess, you got destroyed in the last debate so now you're not even going to try this time and just post haha propaganda and sit on your thumb. OK. Great talk.
t1_dtgmola	0	*	Said the party of Crystal Therapy Juicero Venture Capitalists?  There's not a monopoly on ignorance. Now bring me my raw water, chop chop.

t1_duv5n3s	1	*	Thank you :)
t1_duvfmgd	0	*	Nice attempt to troll dude.
t1_dta0vnk	0	*	Ok, but if they were being paid by democrats and the FBI and employed this woman doesnt that seem like collusion with russia also effecting the FBI and DNC?  If trump is guilty all 3 are.
t1_duvl0h8	0	*	LOL.   Like I said, I make them and work with them everyday. If you want to have a conversation about them, you need to begin with a framework of basic understanding of biology.   
t1_duv515n	0	*	All existing varities? source on that?
t1_dt4zc5s	0	*	Im skeptical of that claim   Going postal was a term before the 90s.  I remember people joking about a kid that got picked on coming to school to shoot us years before columbine.  
t1_dtwyuq6	0	*	But you said: > I hope we don't send a dime or a single soldier when Russia Blitz's through your shoddy armies.  It's not my fault you made poor assumptions.

t1_dsc1y3s	0	*	Yeah let me plunder your nation for 200 years and lets see if your economy is better off. 
t1_dsby0m3	0	*	I'm saying the first world countries should change the rules if they really want to allow that many people in. 
t1_dsc6llf	1	*	Never said they could. Thing is when I said plenty of conflicts I mean that there are millions of refugees. Under the treaty signed in 1951 nearly every nation has to accept refugees. 
t1_dsczrwe	0	*	Of course the people can go to school to learn. Why shouldnt they?
t1_dsc98ca	0	*	1 terror attack < multiple terror attacks.

t1_dt1x4si	0	*	Erm, exactly?
t1_dt1wkm5	0	*	Yeah I'm pretty sure she's just being reactionary to the word black when it's perfectly acceptable terminology... Surprising considering she's an economics teacher.
t1_dt2exw0	1	*	yep, just got 3 cartons for 30 bucks yesterday
t1_dt2tmry	1	*	Doesn't mater, its very clear that enough consumers chose apple to justify its success. They never forced anyone to buy an I pod.
t1_dt2f5rr	0	*	That *is* my point. The person I responded to was only applying it to Americans which creates a completely irrelevant and useless number.
t1_dt2jt0f	0	*	Its way, way easier to get upset at perceived injustice than it is to actually do something about improving the sorry state ones life is in. 
t1_dt2240t	0	*	Honest statistics? 
t1_dt25qeo	1	*	Coloured market :)
t1_dt23ql2	1	*	I mean, there is a black market and a dark-net.  
t1_dt22k8p	0	*	Oh yes sir, so you are interested in the new Nissan Altima? In what color?  Dark.
t1_dt1zzfq	1	*	The game is changing so fast with vaping doing so well. If we gave it the right support we could eliminate smoking in our lifetimes (most of us).
t1_dt1wo9r	0	*	Dark markets are usually online black markets. Though I don't know think many people actually call them that. 
t1_dt1vttw	0	*	Yes, if there was another business that could use their labor for 20c/hr, they wouldn't work at the first factory.
t1_dt1uc1v	0	*	Fuck you of course it is
t1_dt3111i	0	*	There is no advice you give someone who is too lazy to google shit.    
t1_dt25nck	1	*	Nobody says dark market.
t1_dt1utoi	1	*	You probably whine endlessly about identity politics but you believe that class and everything else are reducible to an identity which basically consists in your occupation.
t1_dt6eu3n	0	*	Then why do we need to massively raise taxes if you dot want to increase overall expenditure? 
t1_dvcze7j	1	*	Wow, I'm hyped by this. Might take some time for me to pick all this apart, but I massively appreciate the effort you put into typing this out!
t1_dt3n42k	0	*	Okay! Then as a follow-up question, do you think the presentation would be equally fair if its selection included regions like The European Union or Central America & the Caribbean? 
t1_dsk9g7h	0	*	Another master argument. You should join your school debate team.
t1_dum7y07	0	*	I'm specifically wondering about the part where you said those that came to the US didn't stop existing, but the ones that went to Europe did stop existing.
t1_dudinfj	1	*	I mean, Colt figured it out. Remington even had a Nylon gun.
t1_dshuw2u	1	*	Yup. It is easy to mask.  I just want to hedge my bet on the off chance they get detected. Just going by past history. But yes, things change. 
t1_dsh1uwu	1	*	I just said my school didn't really teach us. I'm happy you had a better education though.
t1_dsldyxa	1	*	Maybe but all of this is fun for me so whatever!
t1_dsl2m8m	0	*	No, it's not.  And no one is disputing Trump is President, they are pointing put what a shit job he is doing and what as asshole racist he is.  You get that, right?  
t1_duh3kp7	0	*	For the most part, no. No they do not.
t1_dskdioe	1	*	Oh. I thought it was like a push-up except you lift yourself off the ground with force of your pisstream.
t1_dskv8cq	0	*	As I said, we are most likely in agreement about a lot of these things. Welcome to getting old and not liking young people....
t1_dskvyw2	0	*	It is used, and has been for years. 
t1_dskpwia	1	*	Loooooooooooool.  Okay, man.
t1_duk1lov	0	*	It's not a fallacy if they're purposely fucking up the investigations to protect themselves.  There's a classic conflict of interest. 
t1_dukphag	0	*	And you are wrong. GTFO with your shortsighted inability to tell the difference between two completely opposing political parties. 
t1_duj3e65	1	*	I can agree with that.
t1_duj5qsx	1	*	fair, blanket dismissal is wrong, and certain contexts should be taken into consideration; in this case, the situation we are discussing, it seems more benign than harmful.
t1_dujustn	1	*	\*shrug*  As far as I can tell, democrats are against PR measures.
t1_dujtcum	0	*	Oh, you're informing people by Just Asking Questions. I think you're just JAQing off. 
t1_duj7tns	0	*	Exactly. I think the rampant partisanship in politics is a huge problem and people should start making informed decisions rather than listen to ideologues.
t1_dujs0qx	1	*	A singular author isn't a literary canon.

t1_duj321j	0	*	Case in point. The best you could manage, filth, is the worst of mine. 
t1_duj44oo	1	*	Again, I think you support Russia, and I think you're super dumb.  I don't think you're literally a Russian person. I don't even think you're a troll.
t1_dumsj9m	0	*	I see I'm dealing with someone who can't put the facts above their feelings on this issue.

t1_duj72vh	0	*	And where did those governments sanction violence against gays in recent times? 
t1_duiv1fo	0	*	Google John Hopkins. I'm not going to link the hundreds of pages of reports from them on the dangers of transitioning. 
t1_duj55te	0	*	It's called hyperbole. For all practical purposes, they didn't exist. It was very rare to come across anyone who used that term to identify themselves
t1_duj6zli	0	*	Which article?
t1_duj9ylr	0	*	why is it so typical of you straight people to pretend homophobia is just self hating gays? is it so you can pretend straights have no hand in it? take responsibility for your own shit for once jesus
t1_duj27hf	0	*	>Plenty of people from other countries are transphobic.  Yes, but this particular one has a very commonly held Russian viewpoint.
t1_duj2gnc	0	*	I see you don't understand the words retard and fuck.  My stupid joke went about three stories over your head, sorry.

t1_duj8e5d	0	*	Because I simply dont trust a person who claims to be of another identity and I expect him to be a weirdo who wants to peek on people
t1_dujtkra	1	*	> it is about 80% less than when the internet first came around  that doesn't mean it's mostly gone. it isn't even remotely mostly gone
t1_duj3pic	1	*	So 100% of those people who have been elected to national office in DC? 
t1_duj44l7	1	*	Canon, not author. Shakespeare is just one man. 
t1_dujt7h2	1	*	For comparison: all the major branches have them in the USA. For the last 20 years or so. Dignity is the Catholic one: https://www.dignityusa.org        Maybe they're 50 years old now? Wow.
t1_duj7m07	0	*	Haha maybe its not a burn at all I mean frosty the snowman is pretty dope but Im sure he is not the greatest snowman. Just imagine how amazing the GREATEST snowman is.

t1_ds6pqml	0	*	Cool, because thats basically wrong.  Yes I play video games, was born in the 90s, but everything else is wrong. You shouldnt be so quick to judge. 
t1_ds5svg1	1	*	And in this comment, you have shown that you also don't understand how cost of living, and inflation work.   Good job.  Again, don't talk about things you don't know of.
t1_ds7spgc	1	*	You think that was boasting? And what I am to do when someone's shitting over my field? Not point that out?
t1_ds63mzf	1	*	That's not proof...
t1_dsf6s0t	0	*	I replied to a few comments that are all in the same thread. That's hardly stalking.

t1_dswhqiw	1	*	Just dont be a pussy
t1_dsxdoej	0	*	Okay call it product. Any product with a hard limit is deflationary. You're intentionally misusing the definition of inflation in that sense.

t1_dsuw6b3	0	*	It'll still be here for some time

t1_dsvodb8	0	*	The DOW was practically at the same level in November of 2014 as it was in November of 2016. The last two years of the Obama administration were stagnating.

t1_dsuuioa	0	*	What I read was that Canadians overstaying visas is less detrimental than Mexicans overstaying visas. Which is completely reasonable and makes sense.
t1_dsvr9b8	0	*	But they also consume and buy things and need things built.
t1_dsvazrw	1	*	I would argue that the government largely *is* colorblind. Hence all of the laws that outlaw discrimination based on race

t1_dsvsfgf	0	*	Guess so... I'm sure they'd be totally against the idea of being blamed for slavery because they didnt do it, it was just their ancestors. But if another country has a rocky past: what a shithole.

t1_dsvsdou	1	*	Cool, fortunately there was more criteria than that to decide if a country should be banned or not. But sure, personally I think a SA ban would be great too.

t1_dsuxtzn	0	*	That's a mea culpa for me. I thought your comment was made from the same guy who was being incredulous. I shall leave it up. 
t1_dsuu1i1	0	*	I'm all for increased wages, but the reality is that would mean food prices jump up a lot, and since literally everyone eats,  that would ripple across the entire economy. Just for starters.
t1_dsv4isk	1	*	Fair enough. 
t1_dsyobjs	1	*	He doesnt have an argument, so hes attacking your motivations for speaking out.
t1_dsvqc3a	0	*	That's bullshit lol

t1_dsv4l5x	1	*	Obama never tried to ban people from mostly white countries from immigrating in. Don't really think it's an accurate comparison.
t1_dsvt7hf	1	*	Turns out those countries are majority-muslim, but they are not the largest muslim-majority countries....it was a ban on *the most dangerous* muslim countries. Are they not dangerous..?

t1_dsut2kp	0	*	So compare that to 150k Canadians doing the same every year.  Why Haiti and not Canada?
t1_dsuutke	1	*	Ignoring that absolutely nobody is arguing for open borders (or a welfare state, whatever that even means), illegals can't get on welfare, dude. 
t1_dsuxuqg	1	*	You called America a nation of European immigrants, he brought up two major groups of people that were also a part of the US. Largely unwillingly.
t1_dsuy6hj	0	*	Are you doubting me? Are you doubting the cold, hard truth that every other developed nation on earth, *all of which* have universal health care, pay half or less of what we do per person? 
t1_dsuteyw	0	*	A lot of which overstay and can get illegally low wages.
t1_dsw2tuo	0	*	Care to point me to a poll or a forum?  I would really like to see evidence of this first hand.  Really I would.
t1_dsuyujc	0	*	You don't think people staying illegally, working under the table, doesn't incur a cost do you?
t1_dsvx6x1	0	*	I see you still haven't reconciled with the established fact that your constitution explicitly states that I am right.
t1_dsux7go	0	*	It's really not that **big**.
t1_dsvyq7n	0	*	I'm Canadian.  Just because a country was founded on an idea, doesn't mean that later events can't make those reasons less desirable.
t1_dsuumqu	0	*	You realize that illegals would be unable to use universal health care outside the ER, right? 
t1_dsuubka	0	*	Trump, when he banned the Haitians...
t1_dsw3wc6	1	*	And apartheid ended when?
t1_dsustb7	1	*	Not sure how you made that leap in logic
t1_dsv73k1	1	*	That 'region' being anywhere from Africa to Asia.
t1_dsvkucx	0	*	I take it youre also against raising minimum wage?
t1_dsvf3u9	0	*	What part of my post was untrue?
t1_dsv0zif	0	*	Heil?
t1_dsv55z9	0	*	Or built The Wall?
t1_dswknwz	0	*	So, you've never left the hospital?
t1_dsuuqht	1	*	In the short term at least yeah
t1_dsuxziu	1	*	>You didnt insinuate~~d~~ I was dumb but ~~raher~~ *rather* helpfully suggested I ask for an ELI5 to help me understand ~~youre~~ your dizzying intellect? Yeah, okay.  Lol
t1_dsvopap	1	*	You understand things
t1_dsux0wb	0	*	Man you really like changing the subject to random shit. Is it that you lack focus, or are you just too simple to keep a steady train of thought?
t1_dswezqk	1	*	I've lived in a lot of apartment buildings, and they all typically require electricians be licensed to work on the premises. But yeah, obviously I prefer to do things the right way.
t1_dsvjkei	0	*	...That's kinda how churches work, yeah.
t1_dsuufez	0	*	> probably don't even know who Jim Jones is.  you're right. understand should be know
t1_dsuzee1	0	*	Unemployment is falling at around the same rate as last year. You might be gullible enough to fall for Trump taking credit for things he had nothing to do with, but I'm not.
t1_dsuv1bb	0	*	They might even be able to get a few employees off food stamps.
t1_dsw2q4p	0	*	Is that supposed to validate something or are you just throwing out random articles now?
t1_dswfy8y	0	*	That I do not know, perhaps Haiti is one of the closest to US soil among all high offending countries.  If I were him I would cancel the low skilled worker visa program  
t1_dsuu6lt	1	*	So why focus on immigration? As long as there is work people will come. We focus a ton on stopping people from coming but I hear very little about stopping businesses from hiring illegals.
t1_dsuzhb3	0	*	I refrain from doing what people in this thread are doing, which is provide unfounded answers pretending to be informed.
t1_dsv7628	1	*	I mean, yeah, I don't celebrate any British national holidays, pointless tradition is pointless.
t1_dsvnrqt	1	*	Lol
t1_dsva8zk	0	*	Lol, yep, better the nuclear end of man kind than....
t1_dsvbwrl	0	*	He said he did change his views before and gave an example of how he voted. 
t1_dsuytzp	1	*	I'd rather not attend a liberal re-education camp aka college, thanks.
t1_dsv0mzh	1	*	Theres a difference between working on a farm and being a mechanic.
t1_dsv55au	0	*	We're doing it right now. We've done it since the birth of this country  You're saying we should stop, but that's un-American 
t1_dsv6zue	0	*	Because they don't require high skills so making a career out of it isn't attractive...
t1_dsuspbu	0	*	Interesting. I get angry at people that steal from me. You don't.
t1_dsvao6b	0	*	I bet I would get a better answer asking my neighbours dog but here we go again; do you think there is still a need for emergency emigration from Haiti, specifically due to the earthquake 8 years ago?
t1_dsv50rx	1	*	Except Kim doesn't have the best interests of his country on mind, he has his own self interests to maintain.
t1_dsuvr8q	0	*	Lol so many things wrong with this comment.   The Kaiser was the 2nd Reich, not the third. Also, National Socialism was grand-theft and State Capitalism, not Socialism.
t1_dsux5oo	1	*	Never has it risen like this in recent years
t1_dsuvj3a	0	*	Then they weren't working the fields.
t1_dsvjhfc	0	*	Chances are, if you're angered by immigrants, your family wasn't welcome here.
t1_dsuzjms	0	*	You know that's not what I said
t1_dsvja5j	1	*	yes that's the history of the country. it's been all downhill since we lost those candle making and textile jobs.
t1_dsutkru	0	*	 There were also less than 100 Haitians as part of the program in 2016 and not enough to even bother reporting in 2017. They're not exactly flooding the labor market that they need to be focused on. 
t1_dsutp84	1	*	Ok, so you aren't reading the posts on this very thread. That's what I figured.
t1_dsv3ig7	0	*	Did you read the article?
t1_dsuv4wp	0	*	its a 500k investment, not gift. they can already do that without his help why would they just give him 500k.
t1_dsvczcu	0	*	Yeah but one side is led by a man who is looked upon by disgust by the rest of the world. Trump even managed to make North Korea look like the better guys.
t1_dsv21fv	1	*	Everything else he's doing to everybody else
t1_dsv1n1u	0	*	Monticello is Thomas Jefferson's plantation and home. You're thinking of Mount Vernon. That's George Washington's plantation/estate
t1_dsv9sjv	0	*	Oh definitely, which is why the correction was necessary. No one would give a shit if the news started tweeting the entire Constitution at Trump.  Individual amendments tho....
t1_dsutlir	0	*	Your sources dont mean anything considering there is no way to track the amount of illegal immigrants that cross the border undetected. 
t1_dsvbgyt	0	*	Yes, I turn to economists when talking about the economy.   I'd hope you do that at some point in time as well. 
t1_dsv5y60	1	*	I get that a lot. I want to make a new account, but I've had this one for a while
t1_dsxcf6h	0	*	Yes 
t1_dsuukuv	1	*	Haha you're good man. I meant that, not the Constitution. I was the one who slipped up.
t1_duiip4i	1	*	What law am I breaking in Massachusetts?
t1_dtt0ntw	0	*	How can we point to anything if we arent even free to have the conversation as to whether Naziism is a legitimate opinion or an illegitimate one?
t1_dsvvdsf	1	*	Yea but he isn't being payed by the university. Also Milo is just a provocateur who wants to get a reaction from people to make money. He is gay himself.
t1_dswhmrf	0	*	say it again until you learn the difference.  trillions on credit...
t1_dsvsp8q	0	*	It wasn't merely a dumb thing to say, it was a blatant display of racism.
t1_dsv59b7	0	*	I don't make a habit of performing mental gymnastics to ignore lies like some people.
t1_dsxba58	0	*	That's the right wing in a nut shell 
t1_dsx3nni	0	*	It is good. It's the best actually. I hope you gain some real world experience and join me someday my brother. Inshallah.
t1_dsv2zq3	0	*	Project, deflect, redirect.
t1_dsvm4qk	0	*	Fighting Nazis and klansmen I don't see a problem here. Antifa is not the only reason they were violent. 
t1_dsvtpxc	0	*	I am not sure about, but it's possible.  Poor people who are uneducated unfortunately do inhabit America, but are still better off than many many poor people from other countries 
t1_dsvkrvr	0	*	Ad hominem, you are regressing. Typical reaction by someone who has no points. If I can't beat em make everyone else think they are something else.

t1_dsv9rd8	0	*	Look I get it, you were lying.
t1_dsv519h	0	*	Beware those who claim to have a monopoly on objective truth.
t1_dsvvp6e	1	*	Just read my response instead of reiterating your point in 6 different places.
t1_dspoeof	0	*	Most empires chilled out after the Dark ages, Turks are still there.
t1_dslfhuy	0	*	Which are also not white ...
t1_dskixft	0	*	Well, that's not what u/ghostfox1_gfaqs is suggesting. 
t1_dskq3sb	0	*	Quote the part.
t1_du12iqg	0	*	I know you're smart. You can't be a total idiot if you want to keep scamming people. You have to have a certain amount of cunning to think on your toes and spew bullshit on command.
t1_du1nwc3	1	*	Yeah, I was trying to respond to like, 10 people who were all attacking me at once, I must have missed that. I'm usually pretty anal about grammar. 
t1_du109fz	0	*	Here's a meta study someone posted earlier, but the link isn't playing nice with my phone so I've yet to read it myself. http://www.jpsmjournal.com/article/S0885-3924(07)00783-X/fulltext
t1_du18oli	0	*	Doesn't alter the fact that the 'article' was incredibly prejudiced and biased. I guess actual reporting doesn't happen any more. Just more hysterical bullshit.
t1_du0ub9z	0	*	A truth as cold and hard as steel?
t1_du12aou	1	*	>*Hold the tail by the tiger*   *Take the horns by the bull*   *A bird in need is a friend indeed*   *So pull the eyes over the wool*      Gobo Fraggle 
t1_du0ufuf	0	*	Oh yeah bb, u like it when I choke you?
t1_dsojw01	0	*	Jordan didn't want to fight Israel but was pressured by the rest of the Arab states into joining them. It's really not a hard concept to grasp, but you seem to be struggling with it.
t1_dsxv0vo	0	*	You're mad because it's true. The Kurds deserve autonomy, and Erdogan deserves to be thrown to the wolves. 
t1_dsy674l	0	*	Thats from a German. How would the west have known all this?
t1_dt00rrs	0	*	tankies pls leave
t1_dsxgdd8	0	*	You're adding a lot of arbitrary restrictions.
t1_dsx70qh	1	*	Oh sorry. I misunderstood
t1_dsz05fo	0	*	Play stupid? I will not be insulted. What you claim won't happen wasn't even what was being discussed here xad at all. Complete strawman.
t1_dsy5cy5	1	*	And America was formed entirely of white colonists.   See, I can do the same thing. 
t1_dsxuzov	1	*	That is quite interesting, thank you.
t1_dsx8p0b	0	*	So that's your argument against the logical points other people made ? B-but they do then give them a state in your home how bout that idiot ?

t1_dsioplh	1	*	*Sigh....^ People^ are so goddamn STUPID.......
t1_dsgt4p2	1	*	I looked it up and apparently bug chaser is the opposite of the gift giver, I thought bug chaser covered both the person giving and receiving HIV.
t1_dshbsgz	0	*	Going with US aggression makes them aggressors too, not to mention war criminals. 
t1_dsgzaoh	1	*	Oh are muslims throwing gays off buildings in America now? My surprise i thought the US was a country governed by laws.
t1_dsgzezi	0	*	Those people are usually trying to promote diversity and are not blaming whites in the same breathe.
t1_dsiokk1	0	*	Canadian armed forces do...
t1_dsiok17	0	*	I was just using your example. 
t1_dsiv753	0	*	There is no counter argument to make. You made a sexist comment, and have now deleted it to save your image. You're both a prick, and a coward.
t1_dsihvh2	0	*	> Not my fault  If it was just me, then its not your fault. But when everybody misunderstands then I would say yes it is.

t1_dssl7he	0	*	Cheers.  Does this mean all the nominally Christian, but have not been in a church for years, are all good?
t1_dssualk	0	*	Conquer suggests annexation, friend. We had no desire to annex any of the countries we've fought since the Phillipines when we took them from Spain. 
t1_dsst9wj	0	*	and like i said, i'm not even a little bit offended :) i hope you're a young person! being young wears off.
t1_dssmhvz	1	*	Right back atcha, Jeftris.
t1_dssw9k9	1	*	It gives blerbs on who they are I assume but I can't read it. I'm assuming they're captured Syrian opposition.
t1_dstvkj5	1	*	You'd have to be dumb as a bag of rocks to mistake a guy that tried to blow up a kid infront of you and a guy with a cellphone idiot.  Go to /r/wpd. What I said has a video there.
t1_dsskiug	0	*	Sheltered sounds too relative, while desensitized doesn't. Not that you're wrong just not exactly what I was looking for
t1_dst0bpo	1	*	Ah, I didn't realise, my bad.
t1_dst1l8t	1	*	Its a poor argument regardless
t1_dsuc02i	1	*	Thank you and everyone else with kind words. Cheers

t1_dst74rj	0	*	Your choice
t1_dst48al	1	*	Just bad Star Wars. I enjoyed it throughout until I remembered near the end it was supposed to be Star Wars. Then I gave some credit to George Lucas for the things he didn't fuck up with the prequels.
t1_dsstskr	1	*	Yeah but then it wouldn't be a religion i.e. tax exempt.
t1_dsszf2k	1	*	I have a band tattooed on my arm for everyone that left after we got back.  I stopped at 6. 
t1_dst13l0	1	*	amazing. stories from veterans really interest me but i rarely get to talk to one, so i appreciate this. I wonder where that kid is now, and if he remembers this story. 
t1_dsslmcv	0	*	I was just about to say that, its like an even worse banana republic like what dole or us Agro,something like that did back in the day
t1_dssmopn	0	*	I forgot about /r/imgoingtohellforthis. There is some funny shit over there.    No morals was bad until they cleaned it up about a month ago. Now its hardly even populated. /r/gore is another one. 
t1_dssss1c	0	*	What is wrong?
t1_dssqokq	0	*	Silence not violence? Its been way too long since I read it but I had thought it was violence around the time of their coup
t1_dssvi8n	0	*	How did that teacher try to justify why they did that?
t1_dsstk7c	1	*	Clearly you're not beating up anyone. You're trying to shout someone down by acting angry on the internet.
t1_dst8ag4	0	*	People can recover from even the most traumatic of abuse. Not everyone but people can recover. 
t1_dsuekhv	0	*	So if thats the root, how do you rate which group is more evil? You must have some sort of tangible system to this or else it is all subjective, which isnt scientific at all.
t1_dssqka8	0	*	Im up voting you because Im awesome and if I remind you of you then that means youre awesome too. So Im up voting you because you are awesome!
t1_dssvktx	1	*	I dont know the reason but we can assume it is no. 
t1_dsyojn4	0	*	One square kilometer is only about 40% the area of a square mile, so I don't agree with your statement of the same order. 40% of 3k is 1200 which is quite a big difference in my opinion.
t1_dsx2xg8	0	*	Im actually showing you that plenty of people started their own business and created their own jobs
t1_dsxlfkz	1	*	That was brutally articulate and accurate. Where do you live? What's your perspective on your own nation?  Sometimes I just am desperate for some perspective. That's the only reason I'm asking.
t1_dt402ly	0	*	So you mean Syria's government fought 6 years along with the Russians against the unarmed, innocent Syria people?
t1_dt40152	0	*	How can I? You already decide what I can think and what I cannot think in your mind.

t1_dtghnif	0	*	Great comment, just FYI it's their. Because English make no sense.

t1_dtgf79v	0	*	The fuck you talking about?I buy my avocados for roughly 2 euros.In germany.
t1_dtg8c16	0	*	That's the converse fallacy. The fact that voters are uninformed doesn't mean that nonvoters are better informed. 
t1_dtg6qok	1	*	How so?
t1_dtg86xn	1	*	Yup, but they were boring and the hippies make for better TV.
t1_dtgrvni	1	*	That sounds like a baby boomer thing to say......

t1_dtne4ua	0	*	Accepted. Always a nice surprise when people are civil on here. I probably should have prefaced that or something as well, as it isnt seen as a friendly comment in most circles.
t1_dtm2pkc	0	*	I agree. A lot of us might feel like we've lost a bit of purpose if we collectively decide to stop breeding though. 
t1_dtu0d4c	0	*	Ok? That doesn't change the fact that a) people still do terrible things to the environment and b) your comment completely missed the point

t1_dsbqmp4	1	*	Not really all that farfetched. They're probably fairly spiritual people and don't really care about it.
t1_dsa6efu	0	*	You were being condescending for no reason and got upset when pointed out.
t1_dsamcws	1	*	I think the disconnect is on self interest. I would agree avoiding a marriage to self interest is Christian. The idea that this means we can destroy our environment is what I'm referring to.
t1_dsaf8n1	1	*	I only wanted to because I was convinced to.   But anyway, thank you for at least thinking about it. :)   Sorry if it felt like I was being judgemental or preachy. I'm just planting seeds.

t1_ducy7ee	0	*	Family migration has nothing to do with skills. The criteria is how much money the British citizen earns.

t1_duai7gc	0	*	IMHO the challenges to build on Mars without an apparent oxygen retention strategy are similar to those in Venus.  But energy, water and oxygen would be more really available on our closer neighbour. 
t1_duamh9i	0	*	I mean...if you want to impose your religious fundamentalist social views on the rest of the country then getting a judge on your side in the Supreme Court is quite possibly the best way to do it.

t1_duaxon0	0	*	Again, what is your point?  What does pokemon and stuff about trump and the media have to do with anything in this thread?
t1_ds39x3v	0	*	You have to get both sides to do it otherwise you fuck up the balance. They su k but they do keep themselves in line. Of course neither side will be the first to back down

t1_dur0k0e	1	*	Its not but the Democrat Party was the face of the rebuild that left them behind. Unfortunately, we only have two parties so the only solution was the Republicans in their eyes.
t1_duv2p91	0	*	Well less military spending sounds amazing!
t1_durrfut	0	*	Everyone loves democracy when they get theor way, and call it garbage when they don't. I can guarantee you never call it 'mob rule' when people vote for something beneficial to you.
t1_durtl4l	1	*	There were quite a few stops in the Midwest and the South. It wasn't just flying a jet between New York, Chicago, and LA.

t1_dt6z7mt	0	*	That is one thing we don't have to deal with I'll admit, we only border you, which is fortunate. We also have a tight immigration system which protects our socialist policies from unsustainability. 
t1_dt7e2eq	0	*	Okay. Then doctors from other countries who move to Canada should not be subject to the higher tax rates?

t1_dstscr2	0	*	> the shitholes can fight amongst themselves  Interesting point, so maybe the US needs to back off. The US actually made some of those places worse due to their occupation. 
t1_dst2b86	1	*	So the fact the huge majority of major organisations are religion based, the same religion too, isnt an alarm bell at all?
t1_dssfcu9	1	*	And then you consider that Islam means submission, and Muslim means one who submits, not being Muslim is perceived as an attack that requires a response.

t1_dsbb3cq	1	*	Well yeah. Not the fault if your country as a whole is being massacred to death and starving.
t1_ds5o98u	0	*	Yes that's what I said. Nazis are good because some guy killing his girlfriends parent's has nothing to do with what you said about nazis being terrorists. That's exactly what that means.
t1_ds4uw98	1	*	It's actually a pretty high bar. Considering it a low bar shows how badly the country is fucked.

t1_ds5mlzj	1	*	We agree that Moore lost because he didn't get enough votes, right?
t1_ds5buwq	1	*	Dozens of downvotes on each comment means that no one will ever respect my opinion. I was wrong to come to this sub with a non-liberal opinion in the first place.
t1_ds53sd1	0	*	Why is faulty state sponsored rhetoric worse than faulty capitalist sponsored rhetoric?  
t1_ds62raf	0	*	The line of police officers.
t1_ds4zn5u	0	*	My arguments are not a merry go round, nor are they contradictory. I've pointed out your contradictions, which is why you are confused. 
t1_ds51na9	0	*	It wasn't the Spanish, it was disease, as you just said. Jesus how many times have you contradicted yourself already.
t1_ds4x1wm	0	*	I don't really think the protesters cause was particularly compelling, and as long as they weren't significantly injured, I don't really have a problem. 
t1_ds4utkg	1	*	agreed. 
t1_ds4ugf7	0	*	I think /u/echo-chamber-chaos is just living up to his username
t1_ds7vtxh	0	*	bad idea? you do need a state to manage a society of millions of people in the context of revolutions and having to fight off reactionaries aided by the capitalist world.
t1_ds4q19q	0	*	Tell that to the 1st amendment. 
t1_ds50nj0	1	*	Lmao

t1_dsunoca	0	*	What do you believe? 
t1_dtrfi7g	0	*	Yes it did.
t1_dtr4sru	1	*	The people who need to act are the population of the country. Unless they change their vote there is no reason for the government to change its way. 
t1_dts5qu6	0	*	Nope, Israel doesn't belong to Jordan.  You are confused.
t1_dtqu23u	1	*	No. I boycott based on my views. If I decide further down the line it's insufficient, I'll change.

t1_dt6v4jr	0	*	Oh poor Stalin! So misunderstood!
t1_dt6g1rq	1	*	Yeah, but that's not what the letter was about. The letter was about the emails on Weiner's laptop. 
t1_dt8xqev	0	*	Just shut the fuck up your bullshit is stinking up the place although thats the way you like it
t1_dt5qgm3	1	*	I hope i am, dude is a fucking idiot

t1_dt7va3e	0	*	You showed me something that contradicted you lol. This is all satire, right? You couldn't possibly be this fucking stupid
t1_dt6gda8	1	*	We agree on that point U0001f600
t1_dt61uti	0	*	>Not specific to Russia at all.  now you're getting it. They abused the 702 surveilance system to target political rivals all over the country. 
t1_dt70qdf	0	*	Did Hillary buy the dossier from an independent and legal research firm or from a hostile foreign government. I keep forgetting.
t1_dt6ek84	0	*	>I don't need hard evidence  That right there is why we don't care about what you say. I do require hard evidence and facts. You only require *feeling* like something is true. 
t1_dt7re1u	1	*	That's the thing, the stuff we don't know about may well be nothing, but it may also be hugely damaging for Trump. Only time will tell. 
t1_dt687nq	0	*	I'm saying HRC shouldnt have been on the ballot to begin with. 
t1_dt6muaa	1	*	Unless it's completely wrong (and it has never been completely wrong -- if you think it is, you don't understand statistics) it's accurate enough for this purpose.
t1_dt7s71y	0	*	I hear the weather under the bridge is nice this time of year U0001f642 dont let the door hit ya ass!
t1_dt6253u	1	*	I liked the musical, I didn't read the federalist papers lol.
t1_dt6e8mf	0	*	Opened the article, saw it was in the opinion section, closed the article.  No wonder you've gone this far off the deep end. You cannot discern a journalistic source from a blog post. 
t1_dt6lf4q	0	*	Republicans voluntarily support the white nationalist movement on twitter.  I too would have thought that absurd three years ago.    It is what it is.  
t1_dt5z7da	0	*	Weren't you a game developer or was that the other dude?  And why are you dodging my previous comment entirely? :)  Isn't that a bit impolite?
t1_dt6e9i2	1	*	Do what specifically? Civil rights groups bring suits against the government all the time when there's an individual or group with standing. 
t1_dt680h5	0	*	I actually enjoy all four of those personalities. To each his own though. 
t1_dt6wa0o	1	*	Yes, good, that's a solid fact. So is the sky being blue. But people are angry that America is not as free as it could be.
t1_dt5yrte	1	*	Interesting.

t1_dt6c47q	1	*	its a lot of smoke, but many conspiracy theories have a lot of smoke but seemingly no fire. We'll see, I'm betting trump will be in power by 2020
t1_dt5y583	1	*	John Oliver
t1_dt6dp8c	1	*	I see. Thanks.
t1_dt73qww	0	*	You got me. He not only tried to hijack the nomination, he also ran for it.
t1_dt8y0uu	0	*	If trump doesn't get impeached we will burn your fascist pig, and his fascist party and his fascist government to the ground and I will watch you choke on the ashes
t1_dt7lwra	1	*	No I was giving you a way out for not knowing the term sacrificial lamb, by saying it was synonymous with scape goat. 
t1_dt667b7	0	*	>The evidence is so clear surely he will be out in a jiffy. Haha  Awesome, then your goals will be thwarted.
t1_dt64v72	0	*	Even the ones that resolve this year, new districts will need to be drawn, which on its own takes time, and the new ones will have just as much possibility to be gerrymandered in a different way. 
t1_dt6e0xi	0	*	I re-read that page before I made my last reply. I'm pretty sure I'm not wrong.  Impeachment allows congress to remove a president. It doesn't mandate them to do so.
t1_dt5w8si	0	*	It is relevant to my point which is that Mueller is a person and not a superhero. 
t1_dt5wi0e	0	*	Don't forget the Enron case, the Genovese family and Gambino family

t1_dt67us7	1	*	But seriously, who *didn't* make fun of Trump during the campaign? That's the person I'd be most concerned about. 
t1_dt6af90	1	*	Take it easy. Was just saying that he is indeed an anti trump guy. No need to call share blue 
t1_dt6ehqz	0	*	So did you call Hillary guilty when there was (and still is I think) an investigation against her? Just trying to find your personal line where an invdstigation=evidence of guilt. 
t1_dt6p7tp	1	*	> Nor is Strzoks involvement in either the Clinton investigation or Mueller team strange on its facehe was a highly experienced counterintelligence agent.  What a great line to finish on. 
t1_dt8p5zx	0	*	Once again, no. The military does not have more people willing to kill civilians than there are civilians willing to protect themselves. 
t1_dt654uz	0	*	I dont think the investigation should end right now. Im saying if they dont ever find any substantial dirt on Trump, when does this investigation end?
t1_dt6ofg5	0	*	I'm allowed to draw my own conclusions from the available evidence. Now you're attacking the messenger because you don't have any alternative methodology. SAD! 
t1_dt666xf	1	*	Only when it is the person you wanted will you believe certain people do you seriously not realize the laughable hypocrisy in this?
t1_dt5wheu	0	*	It's also what a review of the facts says.  We have already seen numerous indictments.  And we can see Trump and his enablers consistently lie, in plainly obvious ways.
t1_dt5wqo9	0	*	Would you put your home / life savings on the line over your views? 
t1_dt6srfm	1	*	.#Nevertrump was a conservative group/movement.   Being republican =/= can't hate trump.
t1_dt5xduj	0	*	I love how the Republicans completely turned their back on the deficit by adding close to $2 Trillion to it to fund this tax plan.    So much for convictions and values. 
t1_dt6jcxg	1	*	His own lawyers say hes play acting. His show is literally not news. 
t1_dt62fvq	0	*	Trump is a traitor, and only a cultist or a shill could say otherwise. The fact that his crimes are not called treason because we're not at war has nothing to do with anything.
t1_dt62flg	1	*	I guess time will tell. 
t1_dt6cz26	1	*	Can you not tell the difference between the Guardian's blog/opinion page and their real news articles? 
t1_dt98pw3	0	*	If Socialists were as influential as they allegedly are, it would be they who run the world instead of the extremely wealthy.
t1_dt5w83u	1	*	I'm willing to wager the ones who aren't so supportive are the least likely to be implicated in a possible RICO case, as well. Fighting tooth and nail for self preservation. 
t1_dt61w6c	0	*	Still a lie
t1_dt5wmo0	1	*	Hes like the red shirt in the white laundry. You need it to happen so youll never do it again. Amirite?

t1_dv48z0u	0	*	Also, the refugee lever only works as long as Europe keeps on playing nice. Do you think we forgot how to not play nice? 
t1_dv4benu	0	*	No like Russia, you can stick your whataboutism up your ass, ivan. We actually have democracy here unlike Russia who has to suffer with putin who's been in power for what, like 20 years now? LOL
t1_dv95d5n	1	*	Whataboutism, another standard troll tactic.  And Clinton again? Sheesh. 
t1_ds3m5x2	0	*	Incontinent , not a state of peaceful happiness
t1_ds3hi27	1	*	Yes, one of the major plot points of the movie was blow on the spiders to keep them away from you.  Jesus Christ on a stick. It's how the handlers controlled their movement on set.  
t1_ds4mfs4	0	*	Feel free to lead the charge, bud.  Seeing as you genuinely don't seem to understand what the rebellious types are up against, practical experience may be the only way you learn.
t1_ds4n56u	0	*	I've heard the expression, and I've seen animals do it. I can't say I've seen a human do it. If you really want to use saliva you can spit.

t1_dtson03	0	*	How could that possibly be true when Arabs are not even native to the region? Arabs come from Arabia, a region to the east of Israel.
t1_dtsvneo	0	*	I already answered your question. Yes, the US should continue to give aid to Israel. It's just equally important to recognize that when the US does so, it's not just doing it for Israel's benefit.
t1_dtsuqqc	0	*	so.. you're saying that Israelis are actually Chinese?
t1_dttnep2	1	*	Although Israel contains something like 45% of the world's Jews (and another 45-50% are in the US)......

t1_dtxki81	0	*	I know the Polish community in my area quite well. 
t1_dtxp32z	0	*	Thanks for the borderline racist comment. They're the group that despite falling standards sees the least investment to improve. 
t1_dtxqsr2	1	*	Well I didn't bring far right into this at all. I just said we have an issue with crime and that is a real issue.
t1_dtxvctu	1	*	I blame the EU for that!  Hell, I blame the EU for everything.  Just this morning, my car had a flat tire. Bloody EU!!
t1_dtxmdlb	0	*	With what army? There's a reason it's not the Royal army, Parliament took control after the Civil War
t1_dtxfb0i	1	*	It only really works where the monarch is pretty much entirely ceremonial. When they actually have power you eventually usually end up with a despot.
t1_dtxq6u9	0	*	They downvoted me also. They offered no debate though 
t1_dtxheiy	0	*	Why don't they count? They spread the exact same social justice, identity politics, victimhood feminist narrative that the far-left do.
t1_dtxev80	1	*	Where's the fun in that?
t1_dtxtt31	1	*	Finland _is_ awesome, but the winters are a pain as you say.  Happily celebrating three years here now, and I continue to be impressed by how well things are run.  (Mostly.  There are always niggles.)
t1_dtxemef	0	*	It was Victoria that banned it, and that guy you refer to was a Christian convert who worked for the east India company and died living in England lmao
t1_dty09qd	1	*	Replacing or supplanting the native population. Establishing mercantile trade between the home nations and colony.
t1_dtypmwv	1	*	Yeah, Sydney Australia.
t1_dsx9eon	1	*	I know... hard for you to defend the GOP/US conservatives against reality. 
t1_dswpoz1	0	*	Its not any kind of fallacy. The life of a fetus is of no value. That is the law,  and it would be unconstitutional to change it. 
t1_dswspvo	1	*	In most cases, the woman became pregnant because of her own voluntary actions.
t1_dsx9igd	0	*	Nope, but it is the last option if other forms of birth control fail. Don't argue for taking away critical options for a woman.
t1_dswz9d7	0	*	>prolifers (from their perspective) want to save lives.  And in doing so they put the lives of women at risk. Just because their perspective is wrong doesn't mean they are actually saving lives.
t1_dswl03n	0	*	No it hasn't. You guys are talking about a situation where someone was contracted by the city!
t1_dswphk2	0	*	Well Im just using your own logic against you. I mean are you really trying to assert that fetuses arent human? And you tried to argue for it? This is just getting ridiculous, Im done here.
t1_dsy14oo	0	*	There is a disagreement whether opinion on abortion should be one of the criteria which is why we are arguing about it in the first place.  
t1_dswqiu0	0	*	I'm sure half pipe Steve finds it troubling too.
t1_dswohmp	0	*	So, in your world, at what point is it immoral to abort a human fetus?
t1_dswo5st	0	*	People don't always choose to have sex. Rape is not a different story, it's part of the same story.
t1_dswu8d5	0	*	i feel like both you guys are making assumptions instead of just asking me questions. if you want me to clarify something go ahead.
t1_dsx7uaw	0	*	I don't think you've realized what I've said was a joke 
t1_dsx3fxr	0	*	So... you think a women's freedom of their own body and life is up for compromise?
t1_dswp4it	0	*	Google disagrees. And I've studied Swedish, English, Finnish, French, Spanish, Korean and Japanese, and English is a cakewalk compared to all of them.
t1_dszspet	1	*	You are claiming Webers hypothesis to be sound, and I disagree. Religion has been a framework of conservatism for hundreds of years.  
t1_dswnbql	0	*	They weren't advocating against any law. It's not complicated. Women have the legal right to choose, and they were advocating a choice. This is not a matter of opinion, it's a matter of comprehension.
t1_dswrksg	0	*	https://imgur.com/a/Vq5JJ  Ok, this isn't murder
t1_dswqp7s	0	*	Spare us the straw-clump-of-cells fallacies.
t1_dswzn6m	1	*	Never is a long time
t1_dswrpk7	0	*	But is it that they are using tax dollars for it, or are the tax dollars going to whatever they are meant to, but the organization opposes and protests against abortion using their own money? 
t1_dswmsmi	1	*	Will all great Neptunes ocean wash this blood clean from my hand?
t1_dswprgd	1	*	And keep in mind these are the worst of the worst. There's a long list of drugs somewhat or massively below the harm level of these drugs or alcohol that are illegal. Marijuana's not the only one. 
t1_dswha5u	0	*	Because it's happened in ontario in 2012, pastor who had been marrying for 15 years gets fired if they don't do it.
t1_dsylzhf	1	*	Treat them like what?
t1_dsxb3of	0	*	What does the state think? after a newborn is assigned an identity as a person (name, SS#, etc.), what does the state currently think?
t1_dsz39ha	0	*	Men have no say in the matter because their body does not go through pregnancy.  That is the point.  You're being rather deliberately obtuse, I feel.
t1_dsyhudc	0	*	All 300k abortion in the USA (even though this article is about Canada) are fine because it's a woman's choice what to do with her uterus.  
t1_dswpdyo	1	*	No problem.
t1_dswpsfz	1	*	The Constitution. 
t1_dswzb7x	0	*	Abortion isn't about bettering your own life. Not in the majority of cases anyway.
t1_dsyido8	0	*	It isnt false. Both definitions are main stream enough to be considered true. Quit being obtuse. Why do you care so much about this anyways? You know what Im talking about. 
t1_dswqss5	0	*	they are property, personal or not.
t1_dswqtry	0	*	Of course it is a person. What makes you think a fetus is nothing more than a clump of cells?
t1_dswr3ah	0	*	Huh? I think you may be confused. Nobody's life gets sacrificed when an organ is donated from a living donor. 
t1_dszhtbx	1	*	> then you can argue making anything illegal is facism  Okay, Im done
t1_dsxmqpk	1	*	Yep, I've had people on this site actually argue that fetuses are comparable to a cancerous tumor. 
t1_dswogxj	0	*	You're shifting the goalposts.
t1_dswv003	0	*	Correct, but they do not have actual sapience like the mother. To disregard the mother's actual sapience for the nonexistent sapience of a potential sapience is morally wrong.
t1_dsy12vy	1	*	I'll get a grip, friend. How about you go get an education. Then we can both come back here and have a rationale discussion based on biology.
t1_dsx30tx	1	*	Don't bother with him. The kids probably mentally retarded
t1_dswu4l1	0	*	Oh right the second part that sucks. I don't want my tax dollars to pay for that shit.
t1_dsy29tq	0	*	Dude were not gonna get anywhere. So just continue coming up with excuses on why you think its okay to murder babies and strip away their chance at life
t1_dsxsso4	0	*	You have every right to not get pregnant. Killing a child, however, isn't a right of yours. If there is a risk of ending a life then you don't have that. 
t1_dswpua7	1	*	If only I could leave all anti-choice scum burning in lava. 
t1_dswm91h	0	*	So, you're using a law, to justify itself? 
t1_dswryoy	0	*	That is neither what I said nor what coma is. A coma is loss of consciousness, death is clinically and legally defined as cessation of detectable brainwaves. 
t1_dsxcwr7	0	*	Well no those who opposed it wouldn't just have to accept that. In a democracy they can work towards changing people's mind, changing the law, changing government policies.
t1_dswsf1j	0	*	See how you use fetus, and I used baby? That is 99% of the problem.  If you're living in someones house and if they didn't let you stay, you starve on the street. Can they murder you? 
t1_dswp9v6	0	*	Ugh. What are you asking? Do all of that! Just don't do it on the public dime. And if it's a major part of your organization's mandate, then you probably aren't being sincere when you check that box.
t1_dsxfhsb	0	*	So... if Trudeau doesn't give antichoice groups free money the next president of Canada will also not give antichoice groups money?  Ok.
t1_dswpq95	0	*	Slavery was wrong. Abortion is right. The constitution bars any anti abortion law, for all time. Thats how it is in Canada. It cant be changed. You lost. 
t1_dsxdbam	1	*	They are harassing people.   Keep your opinions of what I do with my body to yourself.
t1_dsxlza0	1	*	Precisely. Society is set up right now such that eating animals is extremely convenient and avoiding them is very inconvenient. For farmers and vegans alike. 
t1_dszweuc	0	*	> And I just explained that the issue was settled. Democratically.  And your opinion still matters in every future general election. 
t1_dswn333	0	*	Okay, playing devils advocate: Jim Crow laws were democratically chosen, too.  Did that make them right?  If you view abortion as murder, it doesnt matter if most people accept it, its still wrong.
t1_dswqeve	0	*	I quoted myself from another post because you both responded with the same thing, duh. I like how you ignore the second half you scum.
t1_dswpva2	1	*	No, it just says they have no status. Neither do excised tumours. 
t1_dswpv5x	0	*	Yeah why in the fuck should he? Hes just as guilty of having the child but doesnt own the body its attached to. Dont want to pay child support? Wear a condom.
t1_dswyfcz	0	*	So you'd be fine with your government funding jihadi's & people with muslim extremist views?
t1_dsxsh2q	0	*	human = life form with human dna  non human = life form or non life form without human dna
t1_dswlcva	1	*	There is obviously a third choice that takes place currently in which vegetarians try to convince others to choose vegetarianism on their own.
t1_dt13nad	1	*	Opportunities not available to the poor are available to the rich? 
t1_dsy7uj1	0	*	Can you tell me the exact moment that lump of cells becomes a baby? 
t1_dswl7j4	0	*	Sure. But what about the ones that don't? 
t1_dsyzepe	1	*	I got it from the top of this thread.where someone referred to these groups as anti human. And I don't give a shit if you are getting an abortion I just don't think it should be funded by tax payers.
t1_dsx09a2	1	*	The page you sent requires a login. All that aside, it still didn't prove the point you're trying to make. 
t1_dswrp2d	1	*	If mobile had the ability to gild comments, I would gild you so hard for being such a cool dude haha
t1_dt19r06	0	*	Forgive me... Ive never heard of Mr. Shapiro. Ill go have a look. In the meantime, may I advocate for the most compassionate position, rather than the most extreme?  Its been a pleasure talking!
t1_dswqa6m	1	*	Why do I need to dispute it?  Being more than cells still doesn't make a fetus a person with rights and freedoms, nor does it negate a woman's right to bodily autonomy.
t1_dswoqvp	0	*	I believe in a women's right to choose an abortion at any time. However, I personally feel that an abortion after 5 months-ish should only be done for medical reasons.
t1_dsx5yll	0	*	And if the mother is going to die.....
t1_dswrd7o	0	*	 Again, not sure how 'suffering' a pregnancy morally justifies murdering someone else to avoid it. You will have to explain that moral theory to me.
t1_dsx8afz	0	*	You are very smart.

t1_dswtnrq	0	*	Yes, I covered this...
t1_dswpug3	1	*	I did not know that. Thanks
t1_dswof5n	0	*	So, we should make murder legal since if someone wants to kill someone, theyll find a way to do it regardless
t1_dsxkyh1	1	*	He was much better than Trudeau. Downvotes incoming. 
t1_dswuq69	0	*	I'd have to disagree with that from experience, though that might just be because most of the pro-lifers I've known are Catholic and tend to not be so militant about conversion.
t1_dswp11s	0	*	Alcohol is way way way way way cheaper then illegal drugs, mainly because it is not illegal. Remind me what happened when it was illegal again...?
t1_dswvgsj	0	*	Successful necessitates a healthy infant. A clump of cells that will develop into such will be a fully functional human, with a functioning brain.  
t1_dswqi2o	0	*	Then why stop at abortion? Why not cleanse the poor?
t1_dsxbn27	0	*	Clear indication that pro-lifers should get off of their high horse on the conception of life. They are the ones running on emotions, not logic. 
t1_dswplrw	0	*	Laws against abortion are immoral. And unconstitutional. Being against abortion is immoral, but constitutionally allowed by the charter. 
t1_dsxggtn	1	*	Not prove, just provide literally any evidence.
t1_dsz487b	0	*	You still live with your parents and are 28 years old LMAO

t1_dswq9xs	0	*	So...do you think abortion is murder?
t1_dswqdbf	0	*	> human rights  Since when is killing the unborn a human right? Pretty sure the wealthy elite enjoy the endless child sacrifices to appease their gods.

t1_dsxa36v	0	*	How do we decide what is useful and what is not? Especially in highly politicized issues. 
t1_dswpzum	0	*	The vast majority of abortions, over 90%, arnt because the life of the mother was threatened. 
t1_dsxdth3	0	*	Of course you don't. Cause a lot of morons like you think sex is a must. It's meant for procreation. 
t1_dsx59ip	0	*	Canada  We are talking about Canada.  And they certainly can, because it's part of their mandate to support the charter of rights and freedoms.  Also, not a business.
t1_dtdd3w5	0	*	Moving the goalposts a bit? Now it has to be a formal declaration by one specific committee.  Good job.  You have proven that democrats never did that.

t1_duettwl	0	*	You think the US would send a force sufficient to *occupy* South Korea?  Thats insane. The US could barely mange occupying Iraq AFTER their military had been completely dismantled.
t1_dui4md5	1	*	you should definitely take the L now
t1_ds6zthu	0	*	Afghanistan will never go pro pakistan. Afghan people hate the pakistan government 
t1_ds65sbp	1	*	Yeah I ninja-edited. Bad habit sorry.
t1_ds6502e	1	*	This is true. Half of Kerala state is in Qatar. Huge economic infrastructure is based on cooperating with Gulf countries through human resources which means good visa controls and relationships. 
t1_dv0pliu	1	*	Thanks for informing me.
t1_dv0dw89	1	*	Yeah, the left is fucked at the moment.   However, you could have said that without throwing all your toys out of the pram and I might still have some respect for your opinion. 
t1_dv0csui	0	*	To play devils advocate  I'm afraid it does make sense, sweety. Maybe you should get some reading comprehension????
t1_ds4fqw1	0	*	Oh you mean the al aqsa mosque where two Palestinians did a shooting attack in June or July by hiding guns there? Maybe that's why Israel is so tight on the security there. 
t1_ds4nge6	1	*	It's not inflammatory language but rather a bland, uncontroversial description of Israel.
t1_ds52kbx	1	*	Did I say all of them? 
t1_du3s5lr	1	*	Maybe it will. I guess we might soon see. My money is on Israel, odds on.
t1_dthdad0	1	*	Touchxe9
t1_dth598a	0	*	No. She would be a bad person if she went to a protest organized by nazis.
t1_dtg68qh	0	*	And what?
t1_dtn0j7y	0	*	Well when the guy above me let you know about Google (that website that's really easy to use to research), you told him to grow up. 
t1_dtn0fot	0	*	>Climate change.  >Teen pregnancy in states that don't do abstinence only training vs. ones that do.  >Teen marijuana use in states that have legalized.  What specific claims have I made? 
t1_dtona9d	0	*	Scenario: I really really care about the NHS. I rate its importance as 70% in my vote. But Im split on whether leaving the EU will be better or worse for the NHS. Why is this so hard to understand?
t1_dtos2ym	1	*	Only Ohio.
t1_dtoefnl	1	*	Right, but 100% of the country has the ability to vote and the majority abstained. They knew what the stakes were. 
t1_dt8ka1p	0	*	I suppose a couple more wars started by Arab Nations would do the job.   And by do the job I mean Israel controlling half or Egypt and Arabian Peninsula. 
t1_dt8qnkp	0	*	Literally all your pictures were of detained child terrorists with made up headlines. Try again.
t1_dt8em2k	0	*	Haha oh you are so righteous, no further counter arguments needed. /S all non zionist are cool. Zionism itself is not different from nazism.
t1_dt8i9vi	0	*	Soon^^^TM
t1_dt8mdvx	0	*	[citation needed]
t1_dt8gbbn	0	*	yes, we are all looking forward to a nation that doesn't respect women, gays, religious minorities. Can't wait for the Islamic Republic of Palestine to rise.
t1_ducpxxu	0	*	>A municipality board member is part of the government  Because local government is part of the Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom relations.  I.e.: Government.
t1_ducmfhg	1	*	Whos gonna force turkey to pay them? The US could give less of a shit lol
t1_duczlob	1	*	You're right, it's made up. You can see for yourself on this askhistorians thread.   https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/6rabb3/did_the_soviets_really_send_their_infantry/
t1_dsgdh85	0	*	He had an Arab name. Nothing in his long name suggests Persian. There were many arabs in khorasan and central Asia, and still are.
t1_dunl2id	0	*	The pm is just an mp. 
t1_dupn7xk	0	*	Shaking hands obviously isn't sexual in nature. If it was, then every time two men shake hands, they are engaging in a gay sex act.
t1_dune66i	0	*	And I explained why it might as well not.
t1_dsyla55	1	*	You need psychiatric help.
t1_dsyk8d8	0	*	You do know that vote would have made it pass a few weeks ago but the R's didn't let it vote then right?
t1_du69ivi	0	*	Institutional racism was alive and well like 30 years after WW2, that shit aint history if people alive today lived through that shit.
t1_dsxrs2v	1	*	I see youve pulled out the English Simplified there, unacceptable.  But yeah na I meant the simple glazed doughnut your cops always eat in tv shows.
t1_dswtm11	1	*	Yep, the US is quite unique haha
t1_dtkr394	0	*	I'm confused, do you get it/agree with it?
t1_dtdnmpo	0	*	So he has found a bunch of stuff already, but he is just pacing himself, huh?
t1_ds8boxs	0	*	And your anecdotes are not scientific evidence. I suggest looking *that* up
t1_ds3did5	0	*	Did you miss the UN vote last week then
t1_duaybog	0	*	and fyi, common sense should also make you realize that articles on China from SCMP and The Diplomat are complete bullshit. it's like believing articles about Ukraine from Russia Today.
t1_dszpsam	1	*	LOL. Thanks for the tip cactus fuck.
t1_dszki6l	0	*	Why should there be such a wage disparity?
t1_dt0byw7	1	*	Papa John's never went through with the price increase or the insurance he said it would buy.  They cut hours even after the public was fine with the price increase.
t1_dsjicrh	1	*	Not just ignores them, they double-down and elect them to positions of power. 
t1_dsjpe9i	1	*	I disagree with so many policy points (mostly economic) but thats mostly subjective. Scandals arent...
t1_dsjj996	0	*	Hey, so you've lived in Europe right? You've lived in an area with a large muslim population, like I do currently, right? You're not just making all this up? 
t1_dsjgutv	1	*	I never called anything a no-go zone, I think you are just hysterical.  Also, define safer than pretty much all of for example the US please
t1_dsjf9t5	0	*	All voters who identify as Republican and vote for Republican candidates are responsible for this. The Republicans who dont vote R arent responsible. 
t1_dsjek8j	0	*	Right, so I am dealing with a toddler.
t1_dski244	0	*	I think his point is to prevent immigrants from attacking native populations/nations.
t1_dsjkp3z	0	*	Yeah but the bartenders can't be sued can they?  The establishments cop the fine for irresponsible serving or does the bartender?
t1_dsjfzs0	0	*	Omg you can't possibly be this dumb. You were saying that no go zones are not a literal no-go zone and just a dangerous area. If you have suddenly changed your mind, what IS a no-go zone??
t1_dsjvdz2	0	*	its ok, there's still hope, at least you're not an authoritarian
t1_dsjoipm	0	*	Again, the people who are doing what you are talking about are not the same people who want change. The U S is not a monolith any more than any other country. Less so than many, in fact.
t1_dskhyn8	0	*	Thats only if you adopt the very American view that the government is the enemy. 
t1_dsjpssz	1	*	Can you read usernames?
t1_dsjao4h	1	*	you saw the part where he said clearly right? That makes him right /s
t1_dsmpoxo	0	*	American politics is more liberal than Europe.  
t1_dsjb379	1	*	Gingrich was Speaker of the House (Lower House) and Limbaugh was (is?) a radio talk show host roundabout the time Bill Clinton was President. Very right-wingy folks.
t1_dsjaou4	0	*	I got sick parents, a job and things to deal with. you do it. Good luck. 
t1_dsk9n6m	0	*	What about a distorted democracy that grants some entities smaller or larger votes?
t1_dsjz5hf	1	*	As long as the majority are decent people who care about America at even a base level theyll hinder military intervention if he was ever crazy enough to attempt it 
t1_dsjowgg	1	*	(Different guy)
t1_dsjb038	0	*	Did you assume I was American or did you simply find Americans a good metric to use as a bit sheltered?
t1_dsjp69g	1	*	Then have the three parties in the House, and then only an agreeable compromise can be elected.
t1_dsj9lcq	1	*	Which can (and I'm America's case, is) a democracy...
t1_dsjlvt9	0	*	You forgot Alex Jones and /u/trumpsterisadumpster's ass. 
t1_dsjm4b5	0	*	Neither.  :-)  I'm a triple citizen: Australia, Britain and Canada.  I travel under a UK passport.
t1_dsjepv8	0	*	You shouldn't argue some ones weakest points and not their strongest and not even the main stream opinion.
t1_dsjmmw6	1	*	I couldn't be more embarrassed for you
t1_dsjg8l2	1	*	Thanks homie! All good in my books!
t1_dsjog96	0	*	I don't have an explanation.  But the lack of one does not mean the gubmint did it!
t1_dsjl8am	1	*	Sweden used to be safe I think you meant.
t1_dsjk7f5	1	*	wp my guy
t1_dsk5ys6	0	*	You keep going on and on about how much you hate trump. Who said fuck all about you liking trump? You need to silence the voices in your head and try to pay attention.
t1_dskaq18	0	*	Yes. Belgium is not the Netherlands. Get your facts straight, right.  So please tell us how it is in your neighborhood. 
t1_dsjle1d	0	*	I don't like those either, but i don't think they should be, or are, illegal. They are too vague, too mild and don't rile a group of people up to the point of actually doing it. 
t1_dsjj680	0	*	How are they not real? The guy that replied on OP stated his argument with sources. While the argument changed to what is thr true definition of a no go zone.
t1_dsjve3m	0	*	I've never had a problem with grenade attacks.
t1_dtzh69g	0	*	Derailing a conversation does not make it 'relevant'.
t1_dsjemkf	1	*	And a Democracy. They are both right.  It is called a Representative Democracy.
t1_dskvb1w	1	*	I am really curious what you found on google.  We do not have police presence at school board meetings. 
t1_dsjoh05	0	*	You can't change your race or the color of your skin, but you can choose to wear a shirt with a swastika on it or not.  There's definitely key differences between the calls to action.
t1_dsjmmrb	0	*	Oh sorry ik ken de Dagelijkse Standaard niet vandaar dat de referentie van de nekbaard mij ook niks zei :)
t1_dsjmx93	0	*	Well, your perception is not necessarily reality. Just because you think something doesn't make it true.
t1_dsjc11m	0	*	Well then you're going to have to ammend the constitution because the founding fathers did not want a direct democracy.
t1_dsja8b5	1	*	Which is my main point. Thank you for understanding.
t1_dsjf0g9	0	*	Can you elaborate, instead of insulting me? Not sure why one opinion has authority over others. 
t1_dsjiiwi	0	*	I think both parties have this issue, you're just hearing a lot more about it now, because of trump. Yes, I call myself a republican, but not all Republicans share all the same views.
t1_dsjakgm	0	*	Wait, I think he was fine, a great pres even. Im just saying Hillary was infinitely more qualified yet lost because of her personality issues, which are insurmountable. 
t1_dsl1iwz	1	*	>while celebrating people  literally nowhere do I suggest celebrating those people.
t1_dsjmf5u	0	*	So how is the article using the exact same words that I am using yet it does not support what I am saying?
t1_dsk4e4e	1	*	Meanwhile a white person gets 6 months probation for the same crime. But yeah tell me more about how republicans aren't racist.
t1_dskdlb1	1	*	Agree.
t1_dsjrhhp	1	*	That's still promoting violence.
t1_dt2c53h	0	*	Dude, you literally claimed an entire systematic oppression of people of colour didn't happen in my country. You're not charming, you're an asshole. 
t1_dv0u6hw	0	*	Oh well most are in China. I doubt China will be deterred either way. The CPC cannot stand to lose any face
t1_ds7dvbi	0	*	Because based on what you're saying, you obviously have no idea what effects smoking actually has on a person loool
t1_du0caix	0	*	and with all that life experience, you're still under the impression that people can self govern?   I sure as hell don't have that optimism anymore 
t1_du29r94	1	*	That's pretty funny. People need to lighten up, I had a really simple wedding, some people freak out though.
t1_du3a3zt	0	*	You're suggesting that my leap was as great as yours, meaning in context you were referring to my op  Done with ya sorry kid
t1_du0esfc	0	*	I was being serious but reading it back it seems like THAT comment could go either way.  I meant it though, it really does make me happy when i see a resolution like that so cheers!
t1_dumb26f	0	*	A negative could be proven if all cases are observed.  Edit: downvotes from people who cannot logic
t1_dsq41xb	1	*	ok.  peace.
t1_dsop1hh	0	*	Oh, I didnt know it was up to the individuals - I dont seem to remember writing in how many of my tax dollars go to foreign aid on my return. Ill look for that box this year and be sure to omit it. 
t1_dsooxhv	1	*	Taxes are other peoples money. Spending more taxes on something isn't something I consider generous. 
t1_dsq9284	0	*	>nobody here fucking hates Jews, you ass.  You must be new to the Internet...
t1_dv40h8o	1	*	I was thinking more of how IRS would view the issue, there's a taxation difference between independent contractors and employees and misclassification is penalized...
t1_dv4iec3	0	*	It does. It becomes more complicated in real life though. You need to weigh your risks to the potential gain. We have a lot more to lose if the shot fails, but an unrealized loss is still a loss.
t1_du61tbs	1	*	Very clear is only that you tried to mislead people by manipulating the translation. 
t1_du6zzqd	1	*	Why? Especially since it is not that far away from how it's done already.
t1_dur8qv1	1	*	FYI, if you click on literally the first link below the calculator it will show you this exact problem and confirms that 7000 is 0.002% of 350,000,000. 
t1_dustiq8	0	*	I'd rather this cold civil war not turn hot. There are more logical peaceful ways to get the same results you seek without resorting to the violence you pretend to be against. 
t1_durlvq6	0	*	Are you an American?
t1_durmm95	0	*	And why do you think they want the ability to raise a militia against government????  Basic history.
t1_dur817i	0	*	> And besides, one child dying in a school shooting is one too many  Too many for what then? More than you'd want in a perfect world? Sure.
t1_duroi0k	1	*	I wouldn't visit another country three times and pretend like I can comment on its most pressing issues better than the people actually living there lol
t1_dusflgl	1	*	Well one of us should know how it works
t1_dut060d	1	*	Yeah he was off by quite a bit, but good thing it isnt 100x off, right? For example, 0.00002 vs 0.002?
t1_dusb32y	0	*	Hence why it didn't seem like a good idea...
t1_dur8duz	0	*	1/100 = .01, or 1%.   .001 = .1%   .0001 = .01%  .00001 = .001%  Don't trust the google percentage button, if that's what you're going off. That would change a 50 to 50%.
t1_duru3sx	1	*	Ive been to all 50 states, so not even close.
t1_dusr02d	1	*	See also Scotland. 
t1_duryzl2	1	*	Wish we could care about the kids so disgusting this always happen
t1_durpuni	0	*	You're right, shoot down any ideas at all and be pessimistic.
t1_duudent	1	*	How about girth? 
t1_dusvfr5	1	*	Australia, new Zealand and the republic of Ireland all fixed these problems though.
t1_durepcr	0	*	I live in a very blue state!
t1_duscfdu	1	*	Prohibition

t1_dusleln	0	*	Ok, you got me. You win. You called me out. Whatever. 
t1_durm8ft	0	*	Walmart? 
t1_dus5r21	0	*	You know people are lot more likely to give a fuck what you say when you dont come across as a screeching cunt weasel.   As it is, I really dont give a fuck what you have to say. 
t1_durv0y9	0	*	I disagree. Less than a 100 years ago the US major cities were overrun by gangsters during the prohibition area. I think we are closer to Mexico than canada.
t1_dus0lxe	0	*	Not as many. But school shootings are such a miniscule percent of gun violence even in the US.   All of their crime, gun related or otherwise, and vastly higher. 
t1_dursxuq	1	*	lmao
t1_dusalyz	0	*	I'm sorry I don't speak imbecile, either explain what you mean in English and well have a conversation or keep talking shit. 
t1_dueyk60	0	*	Calling me out for what? Not politicizing a super hero movie? Ya, I'm not the one that's dumb.
t1_duissu2	0	*	Lets bet on it. Longest retreat of US military caused by the Chinese.   You seem patriotic so i don't understand why you are wishing for American soldiers to get slaughtered
t1_duaaj3h	1	*	Yes, in the links that have been provided there's clear evidence including numbers and citations. You're choosing to ignore the actual substance.
t1_dtgc9ik	0	*	Hahahaha
t1_duzwg91	0	*	What is your point? What is your opinion? I genuinely want to know.
t1_dt2b7yk	0	*	It's not the only opportunity, just the most profitable one. The profit potential is what attracts people to it.  Greed brings people to the drug trade.
t1_duie2n9	1	*	If you're insisting on following through with a blatantly bad idea, based on a single vote by a woefully misinformed electorate, solely on principle... then why not take a second vote?
t1_dui43wp	0	*	And what does the economy look like in those places? What's the job situation?
t1_dui4hrn	0	*	Again if what youre claiming is true, all unskilled positions would be at the minimum. They are not so your claim is false. 
t1_duj6mbp	0	*	Yeah, it's an old joke from Soviet Russia:  >'Doctor Pavlov, is it true that Marxism-Leninism is scientific?'  >'No, surely not. If it were, they would have tested it on animals first.'
t1_dui3xiq	0	*	I came home from school and watched TV and played video games. It was pretty fucking sweet. 
t1_dui7y6h	0	*	TFW I try to karmawhore a Ron Swanson quote, but fall victim to Poe's law.
t1_dui0xgz	0	*	So what do you do?
t1_dui75km	0	*	Outlaw image social media. It contributes nothing to society.
t1_dui6nzp	1	*	Because for many you can get by by living smaller like the OP said. And that your case may not be the norm. You said it's not easy being a millennial. But for many of us, we get by pretty well.
t1_duibm8p	0	*	Hows this been received by the employees - presumably you can earn a fair amount more industry?
t1_dui4bng	1	*	I'm pretty sure nobody that declares personal bankruptcy can keep millions of dollars. You're thinking of people that own companies and the companies are the ones going bankrupt
t1_duhz0jm	0	*	You an engineer?
t1_dui1r3v	1	*	Agreed.
t1_dui4m1m	1	*	Agreed
t1_duilvt0	1	*	A ridiculous concept if you ask me 
t1_duip0uq	1	*	hmm...if that's the case, where is my 'capitalist' achievement?
t1_dui8639	0	*	What judge didnt hear anything about that thought the investigation wrapped up in late 2017
t1_duiotwz	1	*	I wouldn't like that for me but sure it would be good to a person I don't know.
t1_dui5zkt	1	*	spot on
t1_duigk30	0	*	Lol, that's not what inflation means.
t1_dui444e	0	*	If most women dropped out of the workforce, wages would rise significantly for those still working as labor supply would be way lower than labor demand. That's just how it works.
t1_duiulop	0	*	Got a source for thst one? 
t1_dui5mhq	0	*	That's something only someone with absolutely no historical perspective could say. 
t1_dui0gqv	1	*	and someone wants to ask you a really quick question that'll take an hour to answer
t1_dui9kq7	0	*	Let me make a wild guess: you're not a gay person of color.

t1_dui1den	0	*	*Elysium* isn't an instruction manual, but Ayn Rand opened that box and let all the demons out...
t1_dui7pgl	1	*	Alright. 
t1_duinxhm	1	*	This may be a difference in our subcultures. 
t1_dui9zhx	0	*	Sounds like a solution for skilled labor, and people in tech, but not so much for the broader populus.
t1_dui3oqu	1	*	Efficiency is what has allowed us to go from 10% to 90%. Notice how nations who tried to spread the wealth destroyed the greed and efficiency motive and stagnated or worse. 
t1_duhyyol	1	*	You must be me. That's my job
t1_duiooyv	0	*	I did, paid it off in '91. Was divorced in '93. But don't worry, when that trickle down comes through I'll be able to afford to finance a house again. 
t1_duib6o0	1	*	People who mock and dismiss things they don't understand deserve to be condescended to. Especially when those things relate to something as important as the law and the economy.
t1_dujbepz	1	*	Seriously at 12, boys were already seasoned miners back in the day.
t1_duirvnm	0	*	Do you recommend anything specific to read more about this statistic?
t1_duidw1o	0	*	Thx bud!
t1_dtt8tm9	1	*	An Arab living in Israel has more rights than an Arab living in any other middle eastern country. The settlements do have to stop though.
t1_dtvg493	1	*	> you said neck up  huh: did I? my bad!
t1_du0kgfz	0	*	Nah dude. My first sentence was sarcasm, then I called you out. Youd understand if you werent such a fucking idiot. 
t1_dttlaa1	1	*	What the fuck where we talking about? Try looking at context and reading the rest of the comment, as in, don't be foolish.
t1_dtt2ioq	0	*	This isn't a refutation of what I am saying, but a completely separate point altogether.
t1_dtsvdvb	1	*	> A democracy in the strictest terms hasn't been possible since ancient Greek times  rojava doesn't real?
t1_dtsuges	0	*	Sounds like all 3 of us are saying no religion should rule over any government ideally.
t1_dtuc2qj	0	*	So who are the cunts you are talking about? That's what I'm wondering.
t1_du2ab1s	1	*	And United Fruit was involved in all sorts of horrible political stuff in Central America at that time. Funding rebels and orchestrating coups.
t1_dtued0i	1	*	Sounds like you just had shit reporting, perception of what caused the violence hasn't changed over time to anyone who was informed to begin with. 
t1_dtt2289	0	*	You don't know what propriety means. 
t1_dtsum8o	0	*	Not sure where you live, but if people didn't wear clothes they'd die from exposure if they had to spend any amount of time outside.
t1_dtuce27	1	*	ooops. yes my bad!
t1_du30afn	1	*	Unless he's missing a sarcasm sign, it's very clear that he's promoting and us vs. them narrative.
t1_dspswmv	0	*	You're assuming I value you enough to want to change your opinion.   That's never been my goal, which is why I'm not bothering empathizing with you. 
t1_dsqgiy4	1	*	Oh sweetheart, my name describes me, but it doesn't *define* me. Real life isn't all black and white and dichotomous like that. 
t1_dspq3p7	0	*	No.  So you can read my mind?  I see.  And how does that make you feel?
t1_dtm0aiz	0	*	So if they didn't provoke the u.s or its allies what did it do to deserve the death and destruction of nuclear warfare?
t1_dujh20i	1	*	We *are* the entirety of NATO.
t1_dujgxba	0	*	No one considers those countries friends, but China lacks the ability to project force across the Pacific against the US Navy, and Mexico would be destroyed immediately if they tried anything. 
t1_dshedy5	1	*	Lol how can contribute to a discussion where you act like you did?
t1_duuem4p	1	*	What's wrong with pornography? Your list of supposed rankings also validates my better than most theory.
t1_du2e497	0	*	> Both sides act like morons  Not arguing that.  They've been fighting longer than either of us has been alive. At some point it needs to end.

t1_dseslct	0	*	Thats quite the relationship the PM has with his or her party. Thanks for all the info. Ill go read up on it all some more. 
t1_dseu4hm	1	*	Mitt Romney probably would have been pretty damn presidential.

t1_dsfcmg3	0	*	that is, without exaggeration, the worst response to anything i've ever read in my life, including at least a couple of neonazis commenting in holocaust threads.
t1_dtwldum	1	*	I see you totally read the linked info. All those activities do fall under the category of distracted driving. So now we know you can't read or drive!
t1_dss65il	0	*	I'll tell you that you misread my previous reply.

t1_dunl1t9	1	*	Because its a point in general, not just in this situation. 
t1_dup2j2u	1	*	It also doesnt help that everyone in Asia hates the Chinese because their government thinks its still the Qing and all its neighbors are tributaries. 
t1_dtu7igj	0	*	we do know he is wrong.  >if you don't do it knowingly you are just wrong.   So, back in high school if I did a problem wrong but I believed I was right.........

t1_duis61l	1	*	>doesnt that seem a bit weird?  Idk maybe English isnt your first language. Seems like a straw man.   Its probably not a good idea to over analyze random comments on Reddit.
t1_duixexh	0	*	Strangest definition of harm I've ever heard of. Isn't harm usually a negative word? Why would you define it in a way that doesn't mean anything negative?
t1_dunihnh	0	*	Why do you feel a foreskin is so important?  And why would I get emotional not having one?  It's odd when people tell you how you should feel about a situation. It's called projection.

t1_duxzrmu	1	*	:\^)
t1_duymn4l	0	*	Civilians should not have access to ANY guns. That's why. Giving them access to the extent that they have is therefore extreme.

t1_duy9425	0	*	The UK has has had a lower murder rate than the US for at least the past hundred years.  The idiotic handgun bans twenty years ago had nothing to do with it.

t1_duyzw4h	1	*	Yeah, but in this analogy the homeowner is Norway, not a single citizen  And the spark isn't an accidental misfire of an individual gun but an intentional tragedy perpetrated with guns
t1_duy4bbp	1	*	To be honest If someone wants to kill them selves me giving up my guns is a poor way to go about it.
t1_du90v7y	0	*	I would have accepted 90 as rounding, but saying over 90 is simply a lie with the intention of misinforming people.
t1_duak06t	0	*	Yes your literally cherry picked 4 things.   Tell me was the liberal party against or for the keystone xl pipeline?
t1_dsakfyw	1	*	Probably would have. He was just being supported because he was republican. 
t1_dsam9ub	1	*	That's fine. I don't really think there is much to do about that.  The problem is WikiLeaks says it is neutral, but is not.

t1_dsp24db	0	*	Interesting. I didn't know about this chunk of land. So essentially there are no laws in that area.

t1_dsnveve	0	*	That the president of the United States of America is the leader of the United States of America.   It's just arrogance to think otherwise.

t1_dsc0a2d	1	*	Add to it the culture of corruption, elite rule, criminality...  The only things Russia can reliably export are weapons, oil, and espionage.
t1_dsc6se3	1	*	Oh, ok. Nevermind, then.

t1_dsc71aj	1	*	Lol. 
t1_dsc68x7	1	*	that, and i believe NATO and the UN would declare that move an outright act of war. Russia would be punished if they went after Finland.
t1_dsbq5xz	0	*	I agree. I personally think theirs a silent understanding that Russia/USA have that they know they should never go to war directly with each other. 
t1_dsc3345	0	*	There is a difference between small typos and constant grammatical errors. I'm assuming that is where op is coming from.

t1_dsbw0xn	0	*	It's still overthrowing a foreign soverign state, and a democratically elected one at that. They are equally as bad as each other.
t1_dsel5s2	1	*	Nah you get conscripted
t1_dsc2tpw	1	*	Actually, that wouldn't surprise me at all. Much of British colonial history was driven by business interests and undoubtedly insurance played a major role.
t1_dsbzig7	1	*	That depends; if you have a better alternative, I'm more than willing to hear it.
t1_dsbynkc	0	*	I'm hungover and have shit to do, so I think I'll pass. 
t1_dsc34ka	1	*	That's not a typo though. In these instances it's an incorrect word choice. Also, he assumed they were *not* stupid...
t1_dsc5qlo	1	*	Ever get that feeling of deja vu? 
t1_dsc21vz	0	*	Yeah.. I have no clue what he was trying to say, a bunch of rambling going on up there. 
t1_dsbyby3	0	*	Yeah shows when the ones who believe in the same method of controlling people think the other needs to be put down for it lol. I think Taliban fought isis also.

t1_dsewr8m	0	*	How is the article trash?
t1_dsbx0zp	0	*	I guess the first phases would be considered a win, but I feel like the fact that we had to go back just a few years later, and stay there for a decade dampers it a little 
t1_dsn9ldf	0	*	Hawking isn't mentioned in your article.  If you can find one that quotes him saying that Earth could become as hot as Venus I would be interested.
t1_dsoqik9	1	*	That's a very compelling argument.
t1_dv04yyn	0	*	They fight with simple weapons, we fight we weapons of mass destruction, and live under the fear of nuclear war (Japan, SK, NK). I don't know if its fair to label them as savages for that.  
t1_dvbiaic	1	*	Reading through the reports of specific cases, it seems as if many of the farmhands are on the side of their farmer and are evicted alongside them.
t1_dv11lgv	1	*	So besides groups of people still operating as tribes, who else is uncivilized?
t1_duzyz49	0	*	I am on board the killing train when its needed, but maybe I hoped we had learned something. 
t1_duzyshb	0	*	undeveloped political leanings? You mean the US isn't authoritarian even though it uses prison slave labor? You don't call militarizing police authoritarian?

t1_duzzn4v	1	*	Explain how.
t1_dv0bo6g	1	*	Eh it is a phenomenon with social media.  But generally speaking Reddit is pro US foreign policy, at least reflexively.

t1_dv011f6	1	*	I guess a village president of 2000 people in Michigan is a first world authority. 
t1_dv00y3z	1	*	Mad world.
t1_dv00xwn	0	*	I'll answer when you say where're you from.
t1_dv029fa	1	*	Ok just let the right shift the Overton window and redefine terms. I'm sure that won't have serious consequences.
t1_duzwebr	0	*	Blacks commit significantly more crimes in proportion to their population than whites in the US. Why?
t1_dv026bp	0	*	In other words, you're justifying your racism. Got it.
t1_dv0aibp	0	*	Maybe he simply hates the city of Antwerp and want it to die?
t1_dv0ew0v	1	*	Is he just not aware of who the Rock is?  Does he think Dwayne Johnson is a secret Muslim or something?  Did he not see Moana?  It's not like Maoris have a low cultural profile in America or anything.
t1_dv04pke	0	*	Maybe I missed something in this conversation, but the Islamic Golden Age ended because of Mongols from the East not Europeans from the West.
t1_dv0obs8	1	*	Fair enough. 
t1_dv0n8zj	0	*	I hope you find peace with yourself one-day, going through life full of irrational hatred is no way to live

t1_duzzk8v	1	*	How about a solution that doesnt ruin everyones lives? 
t1_dv0384w	0	*	So let's pretend it doesn't exist.  What is the objective of this push to convince people that institutionalized racism exists?  What's the endgame?
t1_dv00dqu	1	*	wut?

t1_dv06txq	1	*	> annoying    YOU TAKE THAT BACK!!!! 
t1_dv06qtc	0	*	Lol, it's called a metaphor, genius.  ALL of that land was stolen.  That's just what whites do :)
t1_dv00yjz	0	*	Well doesnt it make sense that radical rights support many views that normal rights support?  If a communist country is happy about something does that mean we have to stop?
t1_duzvg6p	1	*	He was talking about **ILLEGAL** immigrants, not legal ones. You're literally just making something up to be mad about it.
t1_dv05imb	1	*	Probably just fucking around 
t1_duztznc	1	*	I am glad you know better how I feel than I do myself. Quite the ability you have there.
t1_dv06sc5	0	*	yeah man, thousands of violent antifa and blm terrorists rioting and causing violenece the past few years are just a tiny fringe minority. stay woke fam
t1_dv0dkzi	1	*	yes, because colonialism deliberately gave them worse opportunities
t1_dv004rd	0	*	Is that the only standard we judge by? I don't think so.
t1_duzz94x	0	*	All majority white nations with mass immigration. The seeds are there if you look for them. Look how the word diversity is used. It is simply another term for saying fewer whites. 
t1_duzvjir	1	*	Comparing this and his daughter marrying a jew are two different things.

t1_dv1gezr	0	*	Theyre also both male humans beings. Still no analogy.
t1_dv00htz	1	*	Thats because the urge for vengeance is stronger than the urge for a just and successful society.  Proving that intelligence is one thing, but maturity and wisdom are another thing entirely.
t1_dv01tsc	1	*	Being a billionaire would be good too, but Im not sure growing up in the townships in Soweto are that conducive to success. 
t1_dv0b12b	1	*	Ethnostate when? 
t1_dv099vp	1	*	What's up with Trudeau? State side he seems like great guy. Then again, our current president makes a moldy turd look like a great guy.
t1_dv0dcve	1	*	also regional separatists and ideologial factions. Basically what the Russian Civil War was. Or Chinese Warlordism Era during early Republic of China years
t1_duzzuvx	1	*	How about you tell me where I'm wrong instead of calling it stupid and telling me why I don't know what I'm talking about.
t1_dv0bm61	0	*	Because water privatization in Libya, bad as it is, has no effect on South Africa. 
t1_dv043la	1	*	The person above me said socialist/communist, I only covered the communist part. Many countries have tried socialist policies in a variety with varying degrees of success and failure.

t1_dv003v7	0	*	Sure they can have it too bad europeans committed mass genocide on multiple continents huh. Those 20+ million natives killed do deserve some sort of justice.
t1_dv05idu	0	*	OK, so would you rather live with that bad economy stuff, or be slaved and have your kids taken away, whipped, and see your wife raped every day?
t1_duzud8f	0	*	First, you conveniently ignored the context of illegal immigrants, who are criminals. Second, he did not say all Mexicans are rapists and murderers. Why must you lie, you lying liar?
t1_duzxxa4	1	*	I think the difference is that in some countries the governments have figured out that giving people a chance makes them work harder and more productive.

t1_dv0195g	0	*	Yeah, but then ISIS turned the countries into shit holes. ISIS does that.
t1_dv01jbm	0	*	Yeah I know xenophobia and racism are rampant. But openly suggesting genocide is a whole other level than deport all the muslims 
t1_duzzitz	1	*	You must be a frog
t1_duzzh8t	1	*	Obviously its not. 
t1_dv2hyxh	1	*	I'm not saying communism works. I'm just saying that on its own, it's not a hate ideology, and so it is not illegal in Canada to predicate it. 
t1_dt9gxiw	0	*	kimchis not even a drink, its a food.
t1_dt7cn1o	1	*	Basic Korean is sort of easy to learn but it gets complicated rather quickly once you get into the different levels of formal language.
t1_dt931tl	1	*	> but could also retreat back to North Korea, a society they're comfortable with  Is anyone really comfortable with North Korean society? Not even the elites are comfortable with it. 
t1_dt7c95k	0	*	*Hold my Korean*
t1_dt7iyky	1	*	Probably one of those jokes that's funnier in an Asian accent.
t1_dtac27a	0	*	Interesting.  The WH is a cool place.  Its as much as a museum as it is a functioning building for the executive.  Its a shame more Americans don't get a chance to tour it.
t1_dt7aavn	0	*	Still, english and latin belong to the same language family. Chinese and korean dont.  The fact that youre related to your mother doesnt mean youre not related to your grandmother.

t1_dt7if52	1	*	Don't say no until you tried it on pasta.
t1_dt7mz23	0	*	South Korea is close US ally, and US will never remove their trooos from korea, as its a base against China aswell.   North Korea wants to destroy US from face of Earth. How would that work out?
t1_dt7t3p0	0	*	Being prepared to force other people in your country to make sacrifices is no virtue. What personal sacrifice did Merkel make when she unilaterally decided to let in a million illegal immigrants?

t1_dt7mlzu	1	*	Oh buddy... Every day for the last 15 years
t1_dt79mvb	0	*	I disagree. I would say it's more likely that the regime falls than that what you're suggesting occurs. If the regime falls, then it's at least plausible that reunification occurs.
t1_dt7ym2i	1	*	That's pretty good, actually. I hope somewhere down the line we do end up getting that Jokes from North Korea book.
t1_dt7b3qh	1	*	Aw shucks

t1_dt99dly	1	*	>Either way your criticisms stem from a lack of understanding of the subject you are critical about.  That's the beauty of the modern American education system.  
t1_dt7ejdc	0	*	Also why arent you focusing on DOW stocks? Those are the ones with the most impact.
t1_dt7re4y	1	*	I honestly can't tell if you're serious right now. Which is kind of depressing, tbh.
t1_dt7cd2l	0	*	You arent an expert, you grasp the enormity of the problem, and you have no idea how to solve the problem, yet you definitively say that there are other solutions. 
t1_dt8imfu	1	*	If you're talking about Korea, China, and Vietnam, then yes (although, Korea and Vietnam don't use any simplified Chinese characters). 
t1_dt7j44i	0	*	Right, but all the people who were alive when that happened are dead, an American who is against immigration today did not take part in the events that your talking about, so how is it hypocritical?
t1_dt7ntfa	0	*	No. Noooooooooooooo.  #NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
t1_dt7xgye	1	*	I'm by no means saying it would be crueler or even remotely as cruel as their current regime, but we just by default apply different standards to those that we deem 'on our team'.

t1_du4m22c	1	*	Exactly. That is the system in which we exist.  Indeed, it is far worse. Governments have granted the ability to print money to private banks, who can simply create money by creating loans.
t1_du85eog	1	*	That advertising is about emotion. Not about the product.  
t1_dsuulc2	0	*	Yes, that is precisely why he gets the credit. 
t1_duiou4l	1	*	Thanks for posting.  Other guy is pulling the ol' Chomsky (US = evil).  Lol @ robbery and a yoga cult not being minor crimes. So that warrants lethal injection by way of roaming street van does it?
t1_dur010q	0	*	Same thing. 
t1_dsnw6oj	0	*	Obviously it's not easier, if most people secure their data with passwords like 123456, do you know how security works at all? So much for Have a good day
t1_dspog2u	1	*	Yeah, and if that's your objection, you have no sense of morality.
t1_dsnvzft	0	*	Yes, fox News is always hyper critical on Russia  You got me. It wasn't the country that owns crimea, the US annexed the area in the nontraditional sense of giving it to a historical rival  Genius 
t1_duxy29v	0	*	What part of SPECIFIC predictions including sources and direct quotes (In context) is confusing you?   You made the claim. Can't you support it with specific quotes?
t1_dt3odp9	0	*	Source? To be fair, Trumps is not well know to follow any reasonable strategies or advices.
t1_dsq99vr	1	*	Exactly! Economy sure is interesting
t1_ds1qsjw	0	*	Yeah, I was just fucking with you. That was a really good comment.
t1_ds1tujc	0	*	Yes,  thats what the GMD system is for. It is not for a full blown nuclear war.
t1_ds17hyx	0	*	Probably because no one wants to be responsible for an accident involving an unstoppable nuke.
t1_ds1731j	1	*	Your sacrifice will be remembered along with the entirety of LA.
t1_ds15t6x	0	*	Bonus points if you can prove that.
t1_ds16gsf	0	*	Pretty sure no one cares what happens up there.
t1_ds1avqa	0	*	He could found a spin-off company.  Maybe call it Vault-Tec.
t1_ds18ds0	1	*	Also they're complex machines, quite hard to proof against destruction. 
t1_ds2lk7k	1	*	No. There is a very specific set of events that have to happen in order to get a successful nuclear detonation and being blown apart by a missile isn't one of them, luckily for us haha.
t1_ds1a1k3	1	*	I completely agree, but it's a hell of a lot better than the alternative.
t1_ds2ijka	0	*	What main points, you mean the cautionary advice from the experts in this Article? Or are you referring to different experts whose opinions you want me to refute even before you share them.
t1_ds1aoz2	1	*	Good. 
t1_ds1ac1y	0	*	So, you're saying there's a chance. 
t1_ds1fute	1	*	> Now, grab a flea.  Okay, okay, point made.
t1_ds19kfe	1	*	It's an art form, so much so I've never tried. Lol. 
t1_ds160x2	0	*	> you dont know how old I or any other posters are.   I know how ignorant you are.
t1_ds1jps9	0	*	On rock and roll?
t1_ds3ssfj	1	*	I'll certainly research this more, thanks for the info
t1_ds1biz9	1	*	And then we'll use plasma.
t1_ds14ifb	0	*	Well, that would be a massive disaster. The point would be to deter them being used at all.
t1_ds1cvwd	1	*	Oh god Storrow Drive...  
t1_ds18b8c	1	*	Imagine your icbm has to cross friendly territory that is in range of your target's defenses...
t1_ds7mvjy	0	*	No what I'm saying is that there is no known path out of this crisis. Nuking NK isn't some option on the table that people are turning down, it would be world-destabilizing.
t1_ds150fm	1	*	I scoff at Mach 19. 
t1_ds30p9z	0	*	I wonder who gave Nestlxe9 permission to use up all the water xaf\\\_()\_/xaf
t1_ds1bxku	0	*	Not exactly a cultural loss if that series is no longer available. :-P
t1_ds19fvb	0	*	Found someone with an F for his physics class.
t1_ds1sqfb	0	*	I think we'll just end it here because now you're pulling a politician by claiming you never said things that there's evidence of you saying and pulling the victim card of being attacked.
t1_ds1cdg6	0	*	I'll give you infinity North Korean dollars for the technology!
t1_ds188om	0	*	Buddy you just said they have free press with some censorship that's all.  What part of that actually means free press? 
t1_ds1l2tk	0	*	Because you were quick to act like you went to some nice College, but you dont even know what free press means. Youre just making yourself look stupid man.
t1_ds1f0jb	0	*	Why should I defend a system I'm not endorsing?
t1_ds25j87	0	*	Im saying that the US isnt blameless, yeah. 
t1_dsetzqi	0	*	I'm sure you do succeed in some ares, a lack of logical reasoning doesn't necessarily lead to failure in all areas of life. Keep on failing and have a nice life, stay out of Molenbeek though, bye xx 
t1_dsh35vu	1	*	Classic case when someone refutes your point so you call them a troll. Haha you're literally a far leftie stereotype
t1_du39tbx	0	*	Because it is a blatant falsehood that is recognizable immediately.  
t1_du2vzuo	0	*	No, don't run away. Name some of these tactics that you claimed China has used that the US isn't still doing right now.
t1_du1re7b	0	*	Now that you have claimed that it is false, please back it up. 
t1_duc8fbb	0	*	Dude, have you been living in some fat clown's asshole for the past 2 years? It's all been on reddit for at least that long.
t1_dsthpe1	1	*	I was going to pick on that point too.  It is hugely cost effective.   A $50 fee on a $1000 transfer is even good - in fact about half the average remittance fee. 
t1_dstk2rk	0	*	Yes, comb through stuff before you buy it. You don't need to understand the source code
t1_dv2rq4p	1	*	That's not a burn nor edgy, my friend.
t1_dtvuz68	1	*	Oh yeah btw this is an alt version of the iPad ad. Enjoy! https://youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ
t1_duygpec	1	*	How can he do security clearence screening if he had no access to intelligence agencies? Makes no sense.
t1_duziyjk	1	*	Are you telling me Russia was not responsible for that attack?
t1_dtu1dge	1	*	LOL ok dude.
t1_dttu5g2	0	*	This is fucking hilarious. I'm going to assume this is a troll and move on.
t1_dsygefx	0	*	Your paper isnt a paper, its not peer reviewed and is full of errors, of the same type discussed in my link.  Merchants of Doubt likely have you on their short list of supporters..
t1_dscubz6	0	*	So you're saying just get it over with, damn the consequences?
t1_dt8a1s4	0	*	> but that doesn't mean that we should just sit back and allow genocides to happen.  You'll be happy to know that the US doesn't just sit back and allow it - in Yemen, it's actively supporting one.
t1_dtx24dg	0	*	Prodominant socialist relations and a socialist controlled political authority means China ain't a capitalist state.
t1_dud5xdc	0	*	The US military is a gigantic jobs program, a huge sponge of unskilled labor. That's why they don't cut it down despite the fact that they don't need anything that big to fight actual wars.
t1_dud6yuk	1	*	21k is the median wage
t1_ducey8i	1	*	Maybe I'm just cynical but I see the shit that politicians pull and get away with with no recourse and I'm not too hopeful.
t1_dtcagys	1	*	Just like the US who defeated Germany sees them as an ally, I guess.  Vietnamese, fighting for their independence against the US imperialists will always stay heroes.
t1_dstylqj	1	*	sounds like a free and open society
t1_dsqqsmc	0	*	I would say the flight is still a much smarter option. That is filthy cheap and the gas alone there and back and inbetween would add up to hundreds of dollars anyways. 
t1_dsqkuab	1	*	that depends. if its the 20th time you've been to rome are you still a tourist? 
t1_dsr6uf7	0	*	Yes, so? You struggling to understand?  Schooling in Europe not as good as in America?
t1_dsqxoce	1	*	I was Google mapping ski resort to nearest surf zone. I thought that would be pretty accurate. Big bear to northern LA is a few hrs
t1_dss7s9z	0	*	I'm not talking about Europe, I'm talking about the idea that America is a culturally homogenous country which is not true.
t1_dsqzz7n	0	*	So germany IS full of crime and squalor--comparable to Mexico? 
t1_dsqp9y2	0	*	Sounds like you didnt travel while in the US and more than likely lived in some shithole..  just sayn   And more diversity in New Zealand..  come on now..
t1_dsqj36u	1	*	Leave Friday after work at 6, sleep, party all day saturday, sleep in late sunday, eat at restaurant unique to that area, drive home.
t1_dsr6tnr	0	*	Because America is diverse, more diverse than the white only countries in Europe
t1_dstrqzq	0	*	And what if it rebounds next year?... perhaps maybe the international travel has partially been based on media hysteria. US as an economy has been moving up stronger due to this Trump Slump. 
t1_dsqxm8m	1	*	And train!
t1_dura8zw	0	*	I mean the very fact that you responded to a comment calling you ignorant of the real world by saying you have more degrees would be the first argument
t1_ds3ipba	0	*	Put an edit in mate. But nice try. 
t1_ds3zus0	0	*	This article proves your claims to be false. https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/world/middleeast/iran-protests-khamenei.html  But keep blaming Israel. Hope that works out for you.
t1_duigp1t	0	*	Best of luck in your endeavor. And thank you for the civil discourse, a rarity nowadays unfortunately. 
t1_dtso0h5	0	*	I can see why you see it that way. And I suppose I shouldn't use it like so.  I just agree with the quote personally and sorta blinded myself how petty it was to use it like that.
t1_dto9ygk	0	*	The world may not collapse, but shit will get very crazy. You really think some nations (especially our rivals) wont take the opportunity to push whatever their agenda is?  
t1_dtoby2u	0	*	Considering with the entire thread is saying the same thing I did and the downvotes youre getting I would disagree. But yeah. That enough out of this conversation 
t1_dtoboqw	0	*	You do realise the UK has about 20% of the population of the US right? As always, Americans using absolute values to claim superiority.
t1_dto94wa	1	*	Good point! tbh I don't know much about annexing.
t1_dto92ld	0	*	Wow, you just saved my life. How will I ever repay you 
t1_dtosf09	1	*	The Wehrmacht had less than a handful of fully mechanized divisions, that's the point.
t1_dtoe7l7	1	*	I'll try my best! :P But given the blanket of snow outside I doubt I'm in a good position for negotiations right now. Let's wait a couple months... 
t1_dtq1e06	0	*	Swedish friend living there told me this 2 days ago
t1_dtok71a	0	*	Okay, so if we're talking about that, then there is no difference from where it is from. 
t1_dto4j9a	1	*	How rude.
t1_dtog9le	1	*	In fact, don't put anyone in what he just said. It's stupidly discriminatory and rude. 
t1_dtoafeb	1	*	Definitely. People from Florida don't say wankers. 
t1_dtoa9n2	1	*	I don't think he's actually referencing anything just regurgitating the same shit he's seen other people say. It'd be nice if he bothered to learn something and try to respond.  
t1_dtf9fj2	0	*	and that's exactly what I mean by ignorant idiots brainwashed by propaganda, thinking they know what they're talking about when they absolutely haven't got a clue. 
t1_du88lrj	1	*	Oh okay this was  a reference to something, I figured it out with some detective work (and google >_>)  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lucky_Country
t1_du8rzwn	1	*	Can confirm, moved here at 11, now 23, do not remember howard govt. Though my parents loved kevin 07, free moneys.
t1_du85sa7	1	*	And that is called indirect correlation. There are plenty low educated people in first world and third world countries alike who have plenty money to buy an iphone.
t1_du9imsl	0	*	Here you need the basic level of insurance to drive on-top of licensing fees and the registration.
t1_dud2e8l	0	*	>selfish trash living amongst us  You want to throw people in prison for disagreeing with you.
t1_du85icf	0	*	There is no bigger picture. You happily want to rip off tax paying families. 
t1_du8d5cg	1	*	I feel like I've seen this movie before.
t1_du8761t	0	*	And thats fair enough and I agree but thats not what we were talking about. I simply refuse to condone anyone giving up when things get hard, no matter the circumstance.
t1_duax7g9	1	*	None of that rubbish comment justifies anyone, let alone a corporation, paying no tax. 
t1_dubb8d8	1	*	Job assistance that actually does the opposite of assist ***is*** surprising, it's no job un-assistance...
t1_duax2f7	0	*	How could I ever convince a pompous EuroIdiot that America isnt a shithole but we have corruption?  Oh right, you know everything. What part of the states are you from?
t1_dtvx1sq	0	*	hehehehe.... You do realize that the site rules are being enforced site wide right?  Go ahead, keep acting like this. 
t1_dt66wex	0	*	What are you intoxicated on ?
t1_duhgwk5	0	*	U do understand what a monopoly is right? You can still get insurance from a private company in the uk. Meaning there is competition. 
t1_duuz0y5	0	*	I am still not aware of who the fuck you are talking about and the only approach i defended was learn to filter search results for credibility  Fuck off.
t1_duqnmlj	0	*	Maybe you should go back and read the thread
t1_duv4fsp	0	*	no i just do not agree with your statement and applied your wording as generally as possible to demonstrate how vastly inaccurate your statement is
t1_dv2qqne	1	*	Or until it gets mauled by a bear.
t1_dv2sx3w	0	*	Oh man, you need to study history. 
t1_dv2pe8g	0	*	I hear you, it's a rough economy out there for a lot of folks...myself included. Would you have been happier with fully subsidized healthcare? Or some kind of universal healthcare?
t1_dv2svtt	1	*	See the nickel mine (yes they still mine nickel!) in Kenora!
t1_dv2pcmk	1	*	Your trying to reason with white American Southerners.  Logic doesn't apply to their thought process.  They'll only see that they'll have less of a say, so in their mind, you're screwing them over.
t1_dv3e8q2	1	*	The DNC worked against Sanders. The Russians was outside stuff obviously, but that's irrelevant. The point is that the election was not just. 
t1_dv2z1ix	0	*	Usually when people describe the length of the US it's the 3000ish miles from CA to NY. Do you mean the distance from Florida to Maine? 
t1_dv2pq7y	0	*	Because changing the voting system would require an overwhelming majority and Dems didn't have that. 
t1_dv2ruv6	0	*	Because people argue now for over 2 years thats Trump was in cahoots with Putin and he obviously shows favoritism towards Vlad over All of his allies and other regimes despite that. 
t1_dvqxfnd	1	*	Donald fucking trump
t1_dv2rduy	0	*	You lost me at regardless of who did what. You just cheer for the red team no matter what. Enjoy the rest of your day in the bubble.
t1_dv2snoj	1	*	Cat.
t1_dv2ssdo	0	*	Hint: It wont be the US
t1_dv2ytij	0	*	I guarantee your right hand doesn't make more than me, buckaroo. Back to the real world for me you sad, sad little child.
t1_dv3apeo	1	*	I agree.
t1_dv2pswk	0	*	I asked for clarification of something and didn't mock you. Come down off your cross.
t1_dv2u45c	1	*	*You think there's not a lot going on. Look closer baby you're so wrong...*
t1_dv2t7o9	1	*	I genuinely wonder how many more shootings it's going to take before some sort of changes/action is made. This is just ridiculous now.
t1_dv2ovk1	0	*	I voted for Johnson. I dont know why he gets so much hate. 
t1_dv36dg6	1	*	Now that is a more interesting point.
t1_dv2u86p	1	*	There's a stretch I drive sometimes that is twenty seven miles of straight, flat nothing. It's awful. 
t1_dv316wx	0	*	Not if you value intelligence lol. 
t1_dv2tct4	1	*	Oh you're going Athenian. Carry on.
t1_dv3ive1	0	*	What? No it is not. It's an idea born out of neoliberalism that has failed to account for how things have shaken out over the past two recessions. It's getting staler by the day. 
t1_dv2vihr	1	*	The Representatives of the People! Holy shit guys, we figured out an alternative to the electoral college!
t1_dv2uhdi	1	*	Fuck Ronald Reagan.
t1_dv2u0yj	1	*	Sorry. 
t1_dv2l9ny	0	*	That comment right there proves you are not able to stand alone in your beliefs and instead follow right wing marketing.  
t1_dv2py1c	1	*	A fair point - I'll change it.
t1_dv2roxh	0	*	And I acknowledged that with my ending comment after the list.
t1_dv2soem	0	*	>That was the only thing Obama was good at, talking and playing a crowd.  Well at least he could talk. 
t1_dudt6nd	0	*	Please, inform me.
t1_dueonwi	1	*	Oh my bad
t1_dugbaxn	0	*	So you are saying there was no King of Spain nor Spain for Charles I to be king of? That seems historically inaccurate. What was Charles I king of, with regards to his Iberian territories?
t1_dudrv5k	1	*	And according to your text it was a good thing all those people were killed for it.
t1_duep7jp	1	*	I am reading up on it this weekend. A horrible but onterestimg subject.
t1_dudrc1m	1	*	Yeah, I don't believe Spanish either, unless it was contraband. Most Latin American slaves came from Brazil, I thought.
t1_dtutu1f	1	*	Or [they said you was hung! And they was right!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdExsAQuCQA&t=0m25s)
t1_dtuimwn	1	*	Ahhh makes sense now
t1_dtulnjo	1	*	Michael Hutchinson chose both.
t1_dtvjctz	1	*	yay success! :D
t1_dtullq0	1	*	Could it not be argued the jury was also hanged metaphorically speaking? As they were suspended until movement stopped :P
t1_dtukkte	1	*	Got a huge cock? Dont take it in to your own hands. You take them to court. The Penis Court.   
t1_dtul559	0	*	You are sick.
t1_dtvc750	1	*	Sounds too scientific haha
t1_dturkhp	1	*	I'm aware.  I figured I'd toss out the explanation on the top comment before forty people started asking how would that happen??
t1_dtunv8t	0	*	The feds are not the police.  Nice shifting of the goalposts though. 
t1_dtumawn	0	*	Even in that case, it's safer to walk to Gxf6rlitzer Park, which is about 200 meters (or 650 feet) away, and just buy there.
t1_dsjsvas	0	*	really well thanks, spreading globally.   looking forward to the end of imperialism.
t1_dsj354r	0	*	*golf clap* great comeback, i wonder where you got such excellence?
t1_dsjjasp	1	*	Save that argument for the person claiming there's 0 conflict or violence now because it certainly isn't relevant to me
t1_dv7vv63	1	*	I'm not Tunesian and they have never done any good for the world.
t1_dtwtdhf	0	*	Interesting stuff to consider. . Thanks for all info!

t1_duw32k3	0	*	Why dont you ask where he lives so you can suck his dick too
t1_duwuus5	1	*	Generally speaking, developing countries inherit older technology as newer tech arrives.  From a quick Google, China adopted steam power in the late 1800's, after the 2nd opium war.
t1_duvw1bs	0	*	Its been a rough weekend 
t1_duxfe14	0	*	That actually means you emit too much.

t1_duw7s9h	1	*	If I ignore the problem, it doesn't exist.   Like the hole in my bank account. 
t1_dv0r8f2	0	*	Data  Present it or stfu   Until then, why the hell should I listen to your unscientific claims? Show me you did science, then we'll talk. Google =/= science
t1_duw9qxe	1	*	i have a feeling that humanity will have to come to near collapse from wars caused by climate change and the population is bottlenecked before any serious change comes
t1_dv233mz	0	*	Polar bears are bigger, but grizzlies are much better adapted to the environment so they usually win.
t1_duw0unf	1	*	At least a quarter of my co-workers have solar panels on their homes. It feels like a communal effort actually.
t1_duw6b2g	0	*	They did exactly that with the new tax plan.

t1_dt2oef7	0	*	Vikings are cool! Perhaps well know the truth about these fairies later in our life time.. I hope you have a fantastic day! 
t1_dt2xr3i	0	*	Lol there is a definition, like a definition decided outside of myself. It's in the dictionary. Spend some time perusing around in there, I'm sure you'll find it quite enlightening ;).     
t1_dt2olbv	1	*	Yep
t1_dt2mn1h	0	*	Lol no problem, I was agreeing with you on my first comment.
t1_dt2rgmo	0	*	Wow.

t1_dt2l32e	1	*	Ahahah what are you even talking about. Naive 
t1_dt2qxkn	0	*	I mean you have no way to tell me that leprechauns don't exist either. Are you not allowed to call me out on that? Are you comfortable agreeing to disagree on that? I wouldnt be.
t1_dt2qb2h	0	*	Feels over reals, man  Nothing matters except what is rattling around inside his head. The ultimate solipsism.  They live in an entirely different universe from the one of objective reality.
t1_dt2xmxl	0	*	That's what happened, apparently. Genesis 1:1 states that the heavens (meaning, in this context, out space and its entire extension) was created at the same time as the earth.
t1_dt2mhyc	0	*	God bless you.
t1_dt4odb4	0	*	I'm an atheist, former Christian.

t1_dt2o3zs	1	*	All right, thanks for conversation 
t1_dt2qtmo	1	*	And that's why footnotes exist
t1_dt2mjmx	0	*	You are sprinting with those goal posts right now.
t1_dt4hw38	0	*	That would be the creation story where the Earth exists before the light? E.g. Before the creation of the universe?  Haven't seen that scientific theory before either...
t1_dt2t4so	1	*	That's what was described.   An explanation that includes a single starting point will always be burdened with the follow up question.
t1_dt3lkgf	1	*	Dude stubbing your toe is no joke. 
t1_dt2qirs	1	*	All fair points. I always run that risk when I wade a little too deep into my depth of knowledge!
t1_dsdoira	0	*	Why do you say that? Did they determine that, or is it just an assumption?
t1_dur2z68	1	*	Some things are worth the risk.  For now.
t1_dscgm8e	0	*	And the existence Charles Darwin is not proof of evolution.

t1_dtr19r6	1	*	Nah
t1_dtqabwl	0	*	>You have given no evidence that letting in skilled immigrants would have resulted in more diversity which was your original claim. That they did this to decrease diversity.   Intent vs. impact.
t1_dtr9eoz	0	*	Youre welcome to disagree.  You are required to *convince* the officer that you meet the minimum, not simply to meet the minimum.  Its highly subjective, and depends on who processes you.
t1_dtspt68	1	*	Show your research. You want to argue, I want citations backed up by peer reviews and from reputable sites. Otherwise I'm done.
t1_dtqljc3	0	*	It's okay Bernie can still win.
t1_dtqvip1	0	*	Uhh, the original context was that the US shouldnt have a similar immigration policy as Canada cause low skilled workers are in greater demand..
t1_dtqdz6x	1	*	I'm confused by this comment.  Are you saying that because they do it it is acceptable that you do it?

t1_dta8j51	0	*	You seem to want to make the topic go away. How much do you make every time you perform a circumcision?
t1_dt8ysxf	1	*	Aw - you're clearly from a shitty culture where people attack you for having feelings.  My apologies - you are somewhat like a child trying to wrestle with an adult.  You take care, seperatedcoma6:)

t1_dugl8bn	0	*	Hammurabi's code and vigilante justice is far from a perfect world, imo. I get the emotion behind what you're saying, but it's not self-defense if the accident already happened.

t1_du65h3e	0	*	Yes but you're assuming that privacy is equally important as safety. To most people it's not.
t1_du5aqmc	0	*	But NK=Communism, and Communism=Bad, therefore NK=BAD. QED.
t1_du5i182	0	*	Yes, because corporations are evil. They have no regards for ethics, or morality. Governments can be changed easier than corporations.

t1_dtc3lvb	0	*	Your point is irrelevant because it's not what OP is talking about. When it comes to Conservative women in power, Democrats drop the female empowerment narrative.

t1_dtbxzn2	0	*	Ok.  You can say maybe in your area you have a problem.  But to put that on other people is once again, stupid.

t1_dso2asa	0	*	Okay so you are just a troll good to know
t1_dsn7sio	0	*	Trump (and nk) pushed the world to the point of required action. Sk is cleaning up the mess.  Also, what is the cause? Continued existence?
t1_dsnp4ta	0	*	Yeah, it's been improving at a pretty steady pace since about 2010.  Trying to take credit for other people's accomplishments isn't a good look :\^)
t1_dsngiat	0	*	Also boring. If youre gonna commit to a comment, at least put some effort into it.
t1_dsnp3rf	0	*	I do know those things. They are trends continued by policies put in place during Obama's presidency.  Trying to take credit for other people's accomplishments isn't a good look :\^)

t1_dsqflgk	0	*	Yes they can.  Source: I am a professional civil engineer.  
t1_dsrbwgw	1	*	I have a very low opinion of the US too. I agree with some things they've done but there are some huge ones I don't agree with (Iraq and Syria, and their alliance with Saudi Arabia).
t1_dspst5f	1	*	The submitted version was just shorter gif of the incident.  I think OP then posted the video link once people requested it.  I watched it out of curiosity and that was that. 
t1_dspqmr8	0	*	Forgive me of my ignorance, but not all of that 12.5% is from shaving right? Doesn't the dehydration + finishing process condense/put pressure on/shrink the wood to a certain degree?

t1_dsabz3r	0	*	Irrelevant to zionism, but since you're asking: how many Jews have been driven out of Palestine?
t1_dsakc62	0	*	The video in question was a pug lifting its paw in response to CD saying Sieg Heil. Yeah it's a stupid and offensive joke. But it's not the same thing as calling for the death of anyone.
t1_dsb5ll6	0	*	Yea but that's not much of an argument. Its just an ad hominem with no basis.

t1_dtrhzfb	1	*	I think a better one would be Turks calling themselves Roman
t1_dsqdftf	0	*	The nazis were bad but the war was entirely economic just like every war. Therefore taking out an economy is an act of war.

t1_dupb2dl	0	*	Other than the revenge factor after the fact, it isn't a big worry of mine.  Hell, I worry more about drivers on the phone than being shot in combat.
t1_duofsc8	0	*	Please quote me accurate stats. 
t1_dupq16a	1	*	Most guns are semi-automatic so no need to add that in. You can just say a rifle... And I'm pretty sure any gun can still do what it is made to do on a battlefield. 
t1_dupus67	0	*	Yes, because there are 8,000,000 of them.  Why is this hard to understand? Its easier to get something when more of them exist.  There are two of them per square mile in the US.

t1_duocaz5	0	*	No, I just don't see that it has anything to do with stopping mass shootings. The shooters don't care about laws and are planning to die usually. 
t1_dtja96m	1	*	The TV at my folks' place is like that. Not only do they *not* notice it at all, but it keeps switching itself back on, after I deactivate it. Its infuriating. 
t1_dtjbblr	0	*	One person posted an argument explaining how Obama was blocked while attempting to close gitmo. I was asking him to argue against that idea. 
t1_dtimcwo	0	*	Ok so we should have let them live a normal life after they destroyed so many? Say shit happens and forgive them for their sins? Without those people the world would have been a better place.
t1_dtiztj1	1	*	I was more pointing out the numbers they crunched didn't begin to approach 20mil still. 
t1_dtiz05c	0	*	Like I said. Im done feeding you. If you cant have a civil discussion about this then it must mean youre really immature.   Which explains a lot about your opinions. 
t1_dtj99uz	0	*	What about bombing raids during times of war? Should the person responsible for the deaths of children be executed - or does it depend on the reason they're doing the bombing?

t1_dtil5y0	1	*	Just like with programmers! 
t1_dtih3z1	1	*	Radiation isnt as much of an immediate danger for that.  The blast is.  He got thrown far.  Too far to survive probably.
t1_dtixggx	0	*	Well youve been responding to absolutely everyone who has responded to you so it sounds like you have plenty of effort just not the facts.   Edit: go on. Explain why you dont believe. 
t1_dtihvle	0	*	Not for anyone. You're talking out your ass.
t1_dtih29s	0	*	Nukes.  Cold War bomber crews would fly with an eyepatch on so they could continue to fly after being blinded in one eye by the flash.

t1_dtl6evi	1	*	Trump doesn't drink alcohol. Usually only weak people drink in excess. Trump is the most powerful human on the planet, therefore not weak. Conclusion: you are weak
t1_dtijn9f	1	*	Well if you contract says all that's okay, then the landlord's shit out of luck aren't they.
t1_dtikz40	1	*	I said before he won, Trump will show the world exactly how much a person can profit from the presidency. And i was pretty spot on. 
t1_dtikxku	1	*	Lol, Blackwater in gitmo. What a joke. That company cant even hide its own shit let alone the daily fuckery the CIA deals with

t1_dtk8iqy	1	*	Yeah they're definitely not a barrel of fun to be in, that's for sure! Still, I guess it's good that I still think that. I haven't totally lost my mind yet.
t1_dtj9q9o	0	*	What do you feel would be a good solution to some of these issues?
t1_dtixq7c	0	*	Or larger metropolitan areas have a more concentrated homeless issue. I like in a NYC borough and its that bad here. 
t1_dtjjoq3	0	*	In sure being alive is better than being dead. It's really not hard at all to lie 
t1_dtj5m8w	0	*	Almost forgot, research shows that religious experience release similar levels of dopaminenin the brain as heroin. So no, not the same thing as kids faking it every Sunday.
t1_dtjrzo1	0	*	You can think both that theres no free will and realize that people have opinions that change.
t1_dtj9ine	0	*	Well, here's a crazy thought - why don't we just offer *free housing* instead of attaching a bunch of rules to it, and then work on the other stuff afterward?
t1_dtlobxm	1	*	We need more people like you.
t1_dtjrxx2	1	*	I've heard that they force non-religious people to get on their knees and pray, if they want food and shelter. The incident about the transwoman being thrown out is also very popularly believed. 
t1_dtjo3tt	1	*	Went on in residential school (minus gunpoint) until 1996 in Canada
t1_dtivx8y	0	*	Source on poverty rates. And read the article, they have already provided 1.5 million homes.
t1_dtizg1l	0	*	Mine was broken into twice and nothing taken, as theres nothing in it worth taking. Im tempted to leave it unlocked to save the lock repair bill but I dont want it to become a toilet. 
t1_dtjsqv2	0	*	how immature. you know how google works, so how about you use it instead of bitching about him giving you a source (like you asked) when you provide none yourself to refute his point.
t1_dtjgpvg	0	*	Your link actually claims that having a safe injection site increased addiction treatment and reduced injection drug use. Lol. 
t1_dtjjj5m	0	*	LOL, I have a lot to say, but the fact you're calling me sweetheart and calling out my education says A LOT about how little you know what you're talking about. Have fun in your safe space. 
t1_dtilqk7	0	*	because it objectifies them and makes them appear subhuman... dick and pussy are sexist terms... give me ur number or meet me, BH1, ill prove to u how u dont like being treated like an object
t1_dtj9zfi	0	*	How do you feel about homeless tents?
t1_dtl6ljg	1	*	I agree with everything you just said, thank you.
t1_dtj9vhi	1	*	I'm glad we both trust our sources.  To be honest it's only happened once, the other times have been finding needles. The latter scares me more. 
t1_dtjaiad	0	*	And being nice to each other!
t1_dtjbue9	1	*	Yeah man if you've never seen someone not homeless piss themselves drunk you really haven't looked that hard.
t1_dtjm6g6	0	*	You're the one who chose to engage xaf\\_()_/xaf
t1_dtj0o0l	0	*	Yea, and I say stopping people from sleeping on benches is a dumb move it solves nothing, only gives better appearances to the public. No substance.
t1_dtpbmz0	1	*	That doesn't answer my question at all, you may as well not have replied
t1_dtix3k4	1	*	I dont disagree with putting bars on benches (if they have experienced an on-going problem with homeless people, especially dirty or aggressive ones). But obviously its not an ultimate solution. 
t1_dtkae7d	1	*	I'm not sure what you think I'm ignoring?
t1_dtj0ynb	0	*	Sure, but she slept on benches sometimes. I only said thos bench thing is dumb, solves nothing and only takes away the littlest comfort some people had
t1_dtj69q5	1	*	Bullshit.

t1_dtji7dc	0	*	Says the hypocrite on his high horse.

t1_dtja73y	0	*	Wat? I think you have a problem in the brainal area, that's complete nonsense
t1_du818zb	1	*	Well, I couldn't live there as a ghost either anyway, so it's not all wrong.
t1_dthnj2a	1	*	I agreed with you and you're still saying I'm wrong. I don't know what you want me to say.
t1_dth8zxx	0	*	Man must have hit a nerve ending with my original comment, The truth hurts. Digging through my post history to try to discredit me somehow lol.
t1_dst5rwa	1	*	I would imagine they're paying them in existing money, not printing new money just to buy their house.
t1_dta2wgr	1	*	Not really, but keep dreaming
t1_dta4w6u	1	*	So you don't mind Jews getting killed because the land is worth it. 
t1_dtaipi8	0	*	The Saudi government is a monarchy, none of them had any power. The fact that he needs to extort money from them means he's worried about coming up short. 
t1_dtodwuy	1	*	Uh huh, I guess that's why Mueller's made 3 indictments and flipped at least one high level campaign official, and why Trump has tried to fire him at least once. 
t1_dtnyvcc	0	*	Did you not read the memo or what I've wrote about the withholding of material information during court proceedings? I'm not sure what the party of the federal judge appointees proved exactly. 
t1_dtntlqi	1	*	Just trying to alleviate your obvious confusion. Have a nice day :)
t1_dto4x9i	1	*	Whatever happens i will always have the mountains of salt you guys are creating right now.
t1_dto4zm8	0	*	The memo claims that this is what happened.
t1_dtnvpss	0	*	So give me some other evidence that Trump is 'actively trying to discredit' the Russia investigation. 
t1_dtp0h3x	0	*	Bill Clinton was impeached 20 years ago, why would that be top of mind for me?
t1_dtp0pal	0	*	Yes I read that blog post, it was cute, Now did you read the report published in *The Nation*, and left wing publication that hates Trump, with analysis provided by former members of the NSA?
t1_dtqbrv9	0	*	http://thehill.com/homenews/house/372210-gowdy-surveillance-warrant-would-not-have-been-authorized-without-dossier  Okay we'll see as they keep revealing things about it.
t1_dtp75tc	1	*	>I mean what President shittalks on Twitter?  Well, you did ask... Trump isn't the first President to use the bully pulpit.
t1_dtoykhu	0	*	So that's a yes to letting Trump shit in your mouth?
t1_dtnyff8	1	*	Why?
t1_dtuxgv8	0	*	Now that the FBI released the 100% proof that the Steele dossier was not just fake, but they helped him fake it to the FISA judge, where are my nuts? It looks like in your mouth..... Suck away. 
t1_durw5sa	0	*	Whatever you say.  Russian. 
t1_du6ifrh	1	*	If having a proper reading comprehension is special then I weep for our society.
t1_du6wouu	0	*	There's no such thing as ethical consumption under capitalism
t1_du6xhva	1	*	You should take a good look at yourself in the mirror, and ask yourself why people have to resort to being criminals in the first place.
t1_du7ni3u	0	*	The capitalism is fine. The people are fucked.
t1_du8gww4	0	*	Lol Scandinavian countries are highly capitalist. I forgot I was posting here. Liberals on Reddit are the most arrogant and ignorant people.   So many stupid people all reinforcing misinformation.
t1_du6ltjq	1	*	Thing is, he was edgy before it was cool
t1_du6rpz1	0	*	I can do this, but where's the fun? Comeon! Bring me an article YOU think is good! Ne a good sport!
t1_du8gbrh	1	*	Yeah, i figured you were just deliberately being an asshole, but thanks for the confirmation.  Now continue being a useless dick, bye.
t1_du6xgcj	0	*	Did you know you can be a socialist and also opposed to the USSR?
t1_du6pxaj	1	*	You are an insane person.
t1_du6o93f	1	*	Ha!
t1_du77bp8	1	*	It's far left. My point was just that it often pops up in Reddit threads following leftist tacks.
t1_du83hln	0	*	You're going to have a hard time getting me any calmer than this. To us your head is so far up your ass we're looking at a donut with legs. Doesn't look very comfortable.
t1_du6x7pc	0	*	Gotta pay the bills somehow.
t1_du6yndg	0	*	You: Manifest Destiny, is cool
t1_du6w62w	1	*	American military propaganda is insanely effective and pervasive
t1_du6le2t	1	*	We for sure agree on that that!!
t1_du6vffg	1	*	I'm guessing the [Global Financial Crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_crisis_of_2007%E2%80%932008)
t1_du7kbz5	1	*	Exactly. 
t1_du72y1u	0	*	+1 to Cat's Cradle.   I've always wanted to use What Bokononists Say When They Commit Suicide as a title for something.
t1_du6pyz5	1	*	It's literally cause and effect.
t1_du6kmtd	1	*	Yeah but keep in mind this small detail that we're talking about riots and non lethal weapons hence this shouldnt even be in this debate.
t1_du7rl8y	1	*	And I was a leftist until I started to see how much anti business they are, ignore facts, and ovetall hurt the economy because everything must be done via ideological left ways.
t1_du6x2vo	1	*	It's fulfilling the prophecy of consuming itself
t1_du7lima	0	*	So a liberal.
t1_du6kv8b	0	*	Everyone that is tired of the Israel Palestine conflict, ie most people
t1_du6tv66	0	*	...or working exactly as intended.
t1_du6xqr9	0	*	To act as if Hamas has no influence in the West Bank is pretty insane though, wouldn't you agree?  And I do agree about the right win gov't, I don't support them. 
t1_ds2by5j	0	*	Okay. Have a nice day then and sorry I hurt your feelings <3
t1_ds2nyj6	1	*	What about the second one? 
t1_dueghd7	1	*	Please stop misrepresenting what I say. I never said dead civilians were 'okay'.
t1_dunrt7i	0	*	But im busy. And fuck them, its not like they have real work to do
t1_ds33jmh	0	*	You are literally spreading lies by misquoting women. How could you call someone indoctrinated?
t1_ds1mb2h	0	*	https://tribune.com.pk/story/885206/pakistani-defector-was-key-in-osama-bin-laden-operation-officials/
t1_ds1fpk1	0	*	The comment you were replying to pointed out that belief in reincarnation or an after life does not in any way preclude the desire to protect your current life.  
t1_ds2lmzz	0	*	And sometimes the methods used to make a decision or to reach a goal are more important than the end result. In this case people are letting their hate boner think for them. I don't respect that. 
t1_ds1hjie	0	*	Pretty sure this comment went way over op's head. The poor guys can seemingly only respond with try harder or something something whataboutism.
t1_ds1jhth	0	*	What? I meant that them using nukes results in their utter obliteration. 
t1_ds1erbq	0	*	The way to deal with present circumstances is to leave and never go back. Theres no reason for us to have military occupation in the Middle East, its idiotic imperialism. 
t1_ds1jjqe	0	*	Job creators don't create jobs by keeping their money, so that's a contradiction in terms.
t1_ds25x8b	0	*	This is actually the part where you educate yourself on the sex crimes  in Germany on Jan 1st. I'd offer you a wikipedia but shareblue.com might have some alternate reality view points for you.
t1_ds1ofc6	0	*	If you dont think that Pakistan is funding terrorists with our aid, youre as ignorant as you are smug. Im also confused: are you implying that I voted for Trump or are you just a non-American?
t1_ds1rc03	0	*	That doesnt answer any of my questions 
t1_ds1i5uf	0	*	Obama didnt start the wars.  
t1_ds1fowx	0	*	What did you mean by China's bad boi in the region? 
t1_ds1j768	1	*	I don't think you can take inspiration from a reference that itself takes inspiration from the Source material.
t1_ds1nawg	0	*	Quantity never equals quality.
t1_ds25pcp	1	*	The entire yield of Pakistan's nuclear arsenal is approximately equal to the Tsar Bomba that Russia detonated if not a little less. You'll notice we aren't currently living through a nuclear winter. 
t1_ds1m2g4	0	*	Youre gay as fuck
t1_ds1k3um	0	*	Other countries love trump. 
t1_ds1etx3	0	*	So the obvious answer is endless occupation.   Lets just call it what it is: imperialism. It's no wonder the Islamic nations see us as such a threat.
t1_ds1jfj1	1	*	They're both beholden to their voters. Guess who dragged the center point so far to the right?
t1_ds1s4hn	0	*	Why did you preface your comment with that statement?
t1_dsayfdk	0	*	Ok dude, what are you gonna do about it. I'm happy a murderer isn't my PM. 
t1_ds1o14v	0	*	Imagine being so dumb you think Trumps actually accomplished anything. 
t1_ds1ex0f	0	*	Read the definition. 
t1_ds1ijyw	1	*	Pretty much, yes. Human nature, pretty normal thought.
t1_ds1q3sq	1	*	Agreed. Sorry if my point came across as pitched battlefield etc. If anything future wars will be fought in cyberspace which if anything could be even scarier.
t1_ds1jq4d	0	*	It'll likely prove an effective get out of jail free card.
t1_ds1qpm6	1	*	Well that's pretty reasonable then
t1_ds3bmrg	1	*	Lots of positive news about GST, almost nothing critical of demonetisation.  Type Modi into the search bar and look at the threads that get visibility and those that do not. Or you can try beef India.
t1_ds1im9a	1	*	haha wrong again
t1_ds1gw4h	0	*	As if it's as easy as just pull out of the war lmao
t1_ds1iepp	0	*	No, we meddled and then tried to fix the problem. I'm saying we just get up and go. Period.
t1_ds2ld3s	0	*	They said that that the US spent 3 Billion dollars exceeded only by KSA. Do the fucking math! 
t1_ds1qiqg	0	*	I just don't think he's got the attention span or political capital for something like that, but we'll see. 
t1_ds1kuwn	1	*	Touche 
t1_ds1exql	1	*	Thats an idiotic argument, as weve made it much worse, and its none of our business how a country across the earth operates. We have no place there. 
t1_ds1jf1k	0	*	oh yeah you guys were *so* effective in Iraq. Really enjoyed how you guys wrapped that one up nice and tidy and quick.  Oh wait
t1_ds1jpap	1	*	His base is happy to hand out participation trophies left and right to him.

t1_ds1fkqw	0	*	Two to the head 
t1_ds1uqh4	1	*	If we had followed the law, the Pakistanis would have warned and evacuated bin Laden. They were aiding and abetting him. Screw them.

t1_ds1kv7d	0	*	Translation:  Fuck you I got mine  ***  If you don't want taxes, don't use public roads. Don't use public utilities. Don't use public emergency services.  Quit society if you don't want to contribute.
t1_ds1fz7i	0	*	The Clinton Foundation is a post military organization that funnels funding from disaster zones directly into the pockets of New York billionaires. It is crazy how delusional some people are. 
t1_ds1x6xo	0	*	Or reading a book they don't like. Or not paying off the right town elder. If a country doesn't have rule of law then it's not really reasonable to use their courts. 
t1_ds1ov26	1	*	Nah dude. My pride and lunch money trump everyone's safety.
t1_ds2i93q	0	*	Are you really dumb enough to think that the policies that are not even in effect yet have had time to have any effect? The economy is in good shape from Obama's time.
t1_ds1vufz	1	*	Lol, that would be awesome. Imagine the seals trying to eat the one that crashed instead of letting it fall into enemy hands. 
t1_ds3mi5q	1	*	More made up stuff.......................
t1_ds1vu4b	1	*	do you really think we don't have other interests in the region that could be negatively impacted by a government such as pakistan's turning more hostile?
t1_ds1jce8	1	*	it was Obama's fault  But he didn't even do what you just accused him of  Excuse me I said it's Obama's fault please don't challenge my bias with facts!
t1_ds1h73i	1	*	You can be kind to people without giving them aid.  If a country has money for nuclear weapons, it should have money to care for its own citizens.
t1_ds1ew7k	1	*	Well I'm glad we've talked our way into a scenario where we're parsing exactly how bad nuclear Armageddon will be
t1_ds2tfrs	0	*	As if there are no tensions right now.   Tensions rise only when Pakistan emboldened by support from US and China tries something like Kargil, Mumbai attacks and the Indian Parliament Attack.
t1_ds1kt6y	1	*	The army we've sent $33bn in aid to?
t1_ds2j8b4	1	*	http://www.cnn.com/2017/07/27/politics/trump-military-transgender-ban-joint-chiefs/index.html  you can deny reality all you want... it's still reality

t1_ds1husp	1	*	No no, the journalist wasn't fired, two bullets were fired, into his head
t1_ds1yimk	0	*	Yeah I'm done with this one man. You basically just said its fine when you do it because unlike 'spite' (national interests) you somehow can justify all the times you do it as good or something.

t1_ds284dd	1	*	Prove what?  That Saddam maintained control?   That it was deemed unviable to get Saddam out?
t1_ds1gqdq	0	*	The TPP still exists without the US. All that move did was cede US economic leadership in the Pacific.
t1_ds1kse9	1	*	Give him time. 
t1_ds1mx24	1	*	We have Diplomats to divine the truth of such things.  Neither you nor I hold the fate of the world in our hands.
t1_ds1eayw	0	*	Ok, thanks. 
t1_ds20ayo	1	*	How is it implied?   And trading money for favors isn't the only way to have diplomatic relations
t1_ds295q1	1	*	concrete*   he clearly doesnt go anywhere near a beach so no chance of sand.   concrete, however, is present in his mothers basement. 
t1_ds1h2kv	1	*	What was the economic climate that Obama inherited again? And how does this contrast with the economic climate Trump inherited? I forget...  
t1_ds29u77	1	*	Absolutely. But the more immediate concern is a warhead falling into the possession of a terrorist org or other nefarious non-state actor. 
t1_ds1gvaf	0	*	It's the general sentiment.  Classic whataboutism designed to excuse shitty behaviour.

t1_ds1qk7y	1	*	Say what you will about Old Hickory, but that man was a BAMF. 
t1_ds1j4md	0	*	Yep. People seem to be forgetting this. But I guess it's only natural to forget about some of his failures, since he's had so many of them in his first year.
t1_ds1fz76	1	*	Humans are human. Greed, power and the awesome task of controlling the largest economy in the world and the most complex Republic in the world change people.
t1_ds1jdn8	0	*	Trump talks it's what he does, doesn't mean any of it is true or actually going to happen.

t1_dt5lq25	0	*	The Spanish Inquisition didn't happen in a vacuum.  There was a very specific reason for it, and Muslims were that reason.  The Spanish weren't about to lose their country to Muslims *again*.

t1_dtahc3a	1	*	Well then. Best to just direct her to somebody else. Not your problem.
t1_dta5958	0	*	I think it is quite a difference if I say you behaved idiotic or you are an idiot.  Saying to my girlfriend You behaved like an asshole yesterday or You are an asshole it's not the same.
t1_dta3dyo	1	*	So do I, but on the other hand they where somewhat 'on the job' (being on stand-by) and they are representing our country too on such a international event.
t1_dta2k31	0	*	I'm not saying they should enforce laws differently based on the person. I'm just arguing for freedom of speech as a basic human right. I don't think it should matter what country you're in.

t1_dtabw41	0	*	To be fair. That's for the courts to decide. And if they decide it is libel, then it is libel. If they decide she merely said those words in anger and did not mean it, then she will be acquited. 
t1_dtc6e62	0	*	Thats ok. This conversation is clearly going nowhere
t1_dtagq9u	1	*	You are lol
t1_dta0wyy	0	*	What makes you say that?

t1_dta8rbm	0	*	Why do you hate the states so much? I just dont understand.
t1_dtacmug	0	*	> They regularly broke the law.  Some borderline Orwellian laws, as u/FlowCannon said. They didn't threaten violence. 
t1_dta4dlj	1	*	the important part is that some unnamed indian guy used the same symbol for zero and as a place holder. A simple but powerful idea
t1_dtaowta	0	*	Not neccessarily. Depends on what they said, can't find any details on that atm.

t1_dtckeyn	0	*	Enjoy being better!
t1_dta70x1	0	*	Why would I?
t1_dtaau5x	0	*	I never said a thing about absolute free speech.  I am saying that 'hurt feelings' is so subjective as to be utterly meaningless.  Read what I wrote.  
t1_dta6fnf	0	*	That's not an insult, it's a simple observation.
t1_dtav2sd	0	*	So neo-nazis running around talking about minorities needing to be expelled isn't fighting words to you?
t1_dtaaajc	1	*	(rolls eyes)    They're not making a bunch of money off it because it's clear and easy to avoid breaking the law there.
t1_dta4ulu	0	*	Because there are still other classes in engineering that are relevant not taught in trades.
t1_dt9xcog	0	*	I'm aware of the Norman Conquest, thanks. They were French by another name, such as surely as the Cornish are English but not Britons.
t1_dta6hs1	1	*	Wood-table is right in the head.  Oh wow, it is that easy to make up facts, thanks.
t1_dtav7il	1	*	You must be kidding. Harming others or robbing them is not the same as expelling air from ones lungs and engaging ones voicebox.
t1_dta8ejb	0	*	Germany has like 3x less of the population of the United States and are culturally homogeneous.
t1_dta0bs8	1	*	Fuck off, xenophobe.

t1_dtcd9dx	1	*	Aw, I noticed you crawled out from under your blankets to suck your little T_D pal's dick, but you won't reply to my post. What are the odds that a Dolan supporting cunt's also a coward?
t1_dt9zc3q	0	*	Ok dude. Tell me when you come out of your bubble.

t1_dtcahje	1	*	Those fuckers!
t1_dtar601	1	*	I thought Fraulein would have been the equivalent.  But I speak very limited German, so...
t1_dtabwtk	0	*	No, I meant without regard for politics. Did you read, *at all*, what I said? It has to do *with appearance,* not political views.
t1_dta5g1c	1	*	The right ones. 
t1_dt9ztnm	1	*	What makes you think I'm trolling? I genuinely believe you're ignorant, and genuinely believe the German state will collapse to totalitarianism in a few decades.
t1_dt9qo4s	1	*	don't make aussies look as dumb as you
t1_dtc663h	0	*	Blue blue blah blah baseless assumptions from an ignorant fool. Figure out how to have an open mind

t1_dtabpyd	1	*	How can you say that? Especially to a country where the god damn holocaust took place.
t1_dtau5xq	0	*	You know what's easier? Allowing people to say what they want without the government fucking with them.
t1_dtac6nh	0	*	Several of them, but hardly all.  Do you have one of them chanting Blood and Soil?
t1_dtacrq8	0	*	Yeah... [about that](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&q=obama+nazi). It really is a phenomenon that knows no partisanship -- the other side always gets called Nazis.
t1_dtatufo	1	*	Didn't tests show that TSA is less than 1% effective? The FBI did a test and smuggled guns and tsa only caught 1 out of 150 or something like that
t1_dtas88e	0	*	Thanks for letting me know. Bye, now.

t1_dtaaw9v	0	*	> How does it feel to know that your family is complicit in the murders of millions of people?  Dunno, my family is polish.  How about you tell me how does it feel to own slaves?
t1_dt5uxmf	1	*	That's seriously pathetic.

t1_dsc356w	1	*	My god you are making Americans look stupid. Just stop our education system is not that bad as to not know some basic history that doesn't involve western powers. 
t1_dv51rlr	0	*	Except that's not just asylum seekers..
t1_dumtlom	0	*	I was talking in favor of disarmament opposed to MORE armament.
t1_dunknc4	1	*	Except I'm using the evidence that he's a new account made at a time of high debate on an issue that IS manipulated.  Russian or NRA, it's suspicious.
t1_ds7dkcp	1	*	Censorship locally yes, within the Palestinian community there is censorship just like Israel has its military censor, and it's a horrible thing I agree.
t1_dt54xcx	1	*	Because if you don't tell someone where they're going and what things are going to be like that person is liable to do something unexpected and compromise your goals as security officers

t1_dubnmc9	0	*	Whose morals get chosen with things like abortion? Immigration? Gambling? Marijuana?  Morals arent black and white, dont be simple. The law should strive to me amoral as possible.
t1_duadgb5	1	*	I am a truth supporter.
t1_duavsfp	0	*	So your point is he's increased the scope of the war on ISIS and you're comparing that to the full scale war we could have ended up in with Russia. Sorry your point is garbage.
t1_duairjx	0	*	>CNN and Fox not politically leaned  You can call me raging stupid with dyslexia but sure hell won't be played like a chump

t1_durpsyu	0	*	Who developed nukes, attack drones,stealth bombers,patriot missiles? 
t1_duqcs1g	0	*	No. But if someone is going to break the law to be intoxicated while armed, why would they follow the law and not bring the gun into a bar?
t1_duqg9ud	0	*	Ok, but his approval rating did not jump. 
t1_duqbb8c	0	*	>committing treason  Stopped reading right there. No point to go on if you dont know what treason is.

t1_duqw5ad	0	*	So your incapable of extrapolating data?

t1_duqbfsm	0	*	Sure there is, but people dont want accurate information. They want echo chambers.
t1_duqce24	0	*	Unfortunately thats the way politics works today. If you want to have a chance to fix it you need to be willing to make those unappetizing decisions.

t1_dur2znv	0	*	Ah. It's nice to know I can immediately discount someones opinion. Just what exactly do think an analogy is?
t1_durf53y	0	*	More than PRC? More than the DPRK. TIL that Venezuela is extremely Marxist-Leninist, not a social democracy.   Hilarious what neo-libs will say
t1_dur4opw	0	*	Why? Because if it's liberal it's good if it's conservative it's bad?

t1_du7brqy	1	*	But even that... It's so incredibly transparent! You have to be willfully ignorant to accept it. The political equivalent of putting your hands over your ears and going LALALALALA I CAN'T HEAR YOU!
t1_du7f1vk	0	*	Ah, you sly dog. Have it. You deserve it.   Yes, I've been enlightened. 
t1_du7jz5x	1	*	Yes massacres and villages being sacked are very compelling.  
t1_du7kbdv	0	*	You can be disingenuous about it all you want, but the main reason they will never end up in those other Arab countries is because those countries don't want them, and won't accept them either. 
t1_du7evm7	1	*	Again thinking there are only two sides to this conflict is ultimately damaging to a peaceful discourse. 
t1_du7fom7	0	*	He half-heartedly denounced it yet full-heartedly promoted it. His condemnation did not last 2 days before he was speaking positively about it again.
t1_du7f1yj	0	*	You are 100% right. Shame facts don't matter to some.
t1_du8a8w8	1	*	Judaism doesn't use vowels. And they don't want to use the Lords name unnecessarily, therefore instead of typing JHWH they just type G-d. 
t1_du7uq3w	0	*	I find it difficult to credit him for being a master salesman. I feel like his base slops up whatever non sense cones out of his mouth. Hes just such a buffoon 
t1_du7lomo	0	*	solid source. 
t1_du7g3gv	0	*	Could you explain that one to me?
t1_du7nny5	0	*	Guy I replied to. His posts above were about how he saw supporting the genocide of all Jews as a reasonable course of action.

t1_du7axin	0	*	Yes but is the United States going to spend billions trying to get back the over 300 million guns in society. It's not a feasible position. 
t1_du8k3yp	0	*	We can't seem to agree on basic historical facts so there's no point in furthering the discussion. Thanks for your comments, it was pretty insightful.

t1_du7bwc5	0	*	Uh no they did not find the emails? And she used bleach bit software to delete the emails to a point where the fbi couldnt recover them. Are you really this misinformed?
t1_du8776t	1	*	The number could be 2 or 1000, the point doesn't change
t1_du7ee6k	1	*	Exactly! Lots of two wrongs make a right arguments in this comment section.

t1_dsdpdla	1	*	You do not live in reality. Now tell me how I'm being hypocritical instead of restating the claim.
t1_dsd6g05	0	*	Yes, I'm sure that workers living in Foxconn dorms are unemployed, financially unstable, homeless, physically disabled, live alone, and are uneducated.  Especially compared to the average population.
t1_dse0v6p	0	*	Yeap. China have a much lower suicide rate than US. Japan, on the other hand...

t1_dsxkt4d	1	*	I completely agree and I wish it would happen. 
t1_ds3am28	0	*	Like I said, all a people has to do is ask the USA to leave, and the USA leaves. The Philippines did this as an example. 
t1_duz9fyk	0	*	Don't say its nothing....cos Trump and Manafort lived in the same building and spent an unusually lot of time together...

t1_duykbp6	0	*	nope you're trying to deflect form your racism while trying to justify it and then go on to other threads claiming u are against racism. no excuses
t1_duywn2z	0	*	Wow look in the mirror bud. All he asked was that you back up your claim, which you obviously can't since you resorted to a petty personal attack. Lmao
t1_duyjtwd	0	*	dawg look even I was russian at least I am not you or your people dawg. 
t1_duz3s9w	0	*	Ok. I'm just responding to your comment with the phrasing is evidence that he's hiding it pretty well, which at least seems to imply that you think he has it.
t1_duysro6	0	*	Its not like he had a credible argument or even a discussion about anything productive. What kind of conversation are you trying to invoke with a dumbass question like that?
t1_duz43d9	1	*	https://www.npr.org/2018/02/20/587375771/russian-bots-are-spreading-false-information-after-the-florida-shooting

t1_duymdca	0	*	What if I told you not everyone thinks the same way you do? Would that upset you?
t1_duyl96y	0	*	Well seems you're spending an inordinate amount of energy whining about it.  It's the internet. Sorry if it gets you up in your fee fees, komrade.

t1_duzub0r	0	*	Where has he testified as to such?
t1_duyrlxy	0	*	Yep. It would just be more of the same. How was Obama different than Bush? Which wars did he end? Oh, yes, he actually started one. It's all just different flavors of the same pablum. 
t1_duyp2aw	0	*	Please don't shoot up your school. Please know that there are resources available to you. I hope you get the help you need.

t1_duyp20j	0	*	Yep, first time I saw this bot I tried google news api search and it did NOT match their list. Perhaps I should have mentioned that somewhere!

t1_dt1ku4v	1	*	Pay more attention, but you're probably just another republican slave controlled by propaganda. Facts are liberal conspiracy after all... all i can is pray that god leads you back to the truth

t1_dv5dxez	0	*	People want a sub banned because of memes? Weird.
t1_dv57r2m	0	*	Yeah, shitty inaccurate journalism. How wonderful.    Hannity isn't reporting the news. It's amazing how many people think he is doing that though. 
t1_dv5o7n8	1	*	Okay, I was never talking about Kushner. Just the legal system in general. God damn, how are this many people incapable of following a thread?

t1_dsfj916	0	*	You didn't read the Milo article. In no way shape or form does it argue gay people shouldn't have rights.  You have never read a Breitbart article, and that's fine. Just don't pretend you have.
t1_dsfm5wh	0	*	So tell me why Obama waited 8 years and just barely out of office to see his results?
t1_dsfj72z	1	*	i didn't downvote you and i didnt argue it isn't far right.  I'm arguing, successfully, that the user in question has never read an article but is parroting what they have been told.
t1_dsg0bji	0	*	Let me ask you this: can you find something similar (with a right lean is fine) that shows Fox as more accurate?
t1_dsfe24b	0	*	The president like the members of the media is a citizen with rights. Namely the first amendment. The president has every right that citizens and the media do.
t1_dsfh2on	1	*	I don't think this person knows anything about political ideologies, or what makes something right or left.

t1_ds8butt	0	*	No matter, its a good discussion starter for all the intelligent persons.
t1_ds8c406	0	*	> I don't think they have a mutual protection agreement in place  Well done.  Fuck me. What made that so difficult? 
t1_dsp7e0x	0	*	It's the fastest anti ship missile and way more than CIWS and other systems can handle.
t1_dsp35pj	0	*	Not really. They had sheer size and that's it. 
t1_dsp3v5p	0	*	An even bigger threat would be a rogue planet.
t1_dsq0zx7	1	*	so  a) if this is nuclear powered, it's probably expensive, larger and much louder than they claim  b) if it's AIP battery powered, it's range isn't 6k miles. 
t1_dsp2pqm	1	*	Yeah thats what I was shooting for. But shit we are already like 10% of the way to no planet at all lol Edit oh read your number wrong thought it said 1000 mt
t1_dsov954	0	*	That's what I said.  Not sure what you're getting at?
t1_dsp9yfy	1	*	> the group can move how much ? 50 miles ?  Which means the carrier could be anywhere within a circle with an area of 7,850 square miles.
t1_dsp8bxe	0	*	Yes, an incorrect fact.
t1_dspzawm	0	*	Ok so I got it right...
t1_dsp5dif	1	*	> All I'm trying to say is I'm not losing any sleep tonight.  Right there with you.
t1_dsp2hdj	0	*	If you're using a mix of all your methods, including so are, that's good for tracking, but you can't actually guide  the missile with it. And geostationary satellites are a thing.
t1_dsp2oql	0	*	100 quadrillion.  Missed a zero
t1_dspch9n	0	*	Sounds like over generalized junk to me. 
t1_dsrq3v0	1	*	I enjoy women, Mandrake. I do not deny them...but I do deny them my essence. 
t1_dsqih86	0	*	> so let's make it all about US politics...again!  So you think US politics doesn't affect the World? Okay. **I'm** the stupid, narrow-minded one.

t1_dspc37t	1	*	China has slave labor. 
t1_dsp3qwx	1	*	Yes.
t1_dsp8a1t	1	*	You are right. It was Allies vs Axis. It is probably more accurate to say no one won WWII but there were definitely winners that came out after WWII.
t1_dsou283	0	*	Russia is the successor to the USSR. Note who holds the USSR's debt for example or who sits on the security council. USSR == Russia.
t1_dsp6fub	1	*	Indian money was a big part of making the program viable. Its not was yet, but it's limping. 
t1_dsqphrw	0	*	Why havent they used them then?  If its not to prevent war?  Explain it instead of calling me stupid.  Unless you cant.

t1_dsp33z3	1	*	You're not wrong.
t1_dspmffy	0	*	Wars of occupation never end well for the occupying force. 
t1_dsqhj1b	0	*	It shows the estimated direction and scope of the resulting fallout, but it specifically says it doesnt include any casualty estimations regarding the fallout.
t1_dsrqw72	0	*	Yea, def. It's like when your shit faced friend pulls off something that was definitely a bad idea. stop stop stop stop oh fuck it worked.... Well don't do it again!  
t1_dsv817j	0	*	Dutchland? Haha okay buddy. What kind of rebuttal is this? It seems like I struck a nerve. 
t1_dsrybud	0	*	Reading comprehension eludes you.  Giving examples is not a whataboutism.
t1_dsrun32	1	*	I agree.
t1_dssql2m	0	*	A country with nuclear weapons, and threatening to use them, is not a threat worth addressing? Should just be ignored? I agree Trump's way is not the best, but I'd say it's better than ignoring it.

t1_dss6xtq	0	*	No, but since that was a stated goal of every Republican candidate, I didn't include it on the list of non mainstream policies
t1_dssx2ow	1	*	If I pretend it's not there it can't sting  me.
t1_dsrs2xx	0	*	Uh... I haven't deleted a single comment... what the fuck are you on?  I think I pissed you off so much you lost your mind.

t1_dsrvfrr	0	*	I don't respect the opinions of idiots.

t1_dstc7mj	0	*	Please tell me why Im an idiot. 
t1_dsrp3pv	0	*	It's not an invasion if it's your own country, you sound like a hick southerner whining about Lincoln's aggression.

t1_dsliye4	0	*	holy shit. I didn't realize you could top off the previous comment but you did. I just can't pinpoint whats driving me crazy from your comments
t1_dsl9ezf	0	*	Keep digging yourself in that hole buddy. Were all laughing at you :)
t1_dslgg3t	1	*	I dunno, man. The righties seem to get triggered by a lot of stuff once they leave their safe spaces, almost as though they were fragile snowflakes...
t1_dsmu1xl	1	*	[Yep](https://www.alt-codes.net/).
t1_dslcnta	0	*	No, it's how you enter the WoW Gold Givaway.
t1_dspvmsr	0	*	I don't know. The first gun-strapped Democrat who cusses like a sailor, we might declare as our first king, lol.
t1_dsl2vht	0	*	Still giggling, go on. 
t1_dsl08r0	0	*	I wouldn't use Fictional books as a reference for what would actually happen.
t1_dsl4iqr	0	*	Creative unemployment figures like the right accused Obama of using? Im sure the families of those affected by the layoffs will be happy to eat the newspapers that your fantasies are printed on.
t1_dsltysb	0	*	Fracturing in the Dems is not a good thing. It just leads to undivided R control. 
t1_dskz2jo	0	*	Do I really need to summarize our conversation for you? Can't you just read it again if you're confused?
t1_dsl24zj	1	*	Well I'll still present the facts, it's up to him to accept them at that point, besides there's other people reading this who need to see both sides.
t1_dsl79zi	0	*	So that would be a NO then...  Any headline that asks a question can safely be dismissed.   AND this is a far right blog to boot. 
t1_dslv8ly	1	*	>  I said it was the only reason hed mention ONLY Norway.  But it's not. He was giving an example. The example was valid. So your statement isn't true from the off.
t1_dslf711	0	*	Do you speak in anything besides drastic hyperbole?
t1_dslcpzq	0	*	All it does for me, is cause my game to crash. Are you sure I'm doing this right?
t1_dslimaj	0	*	Waiting for you to provide substance on economic numbers... Or is this the standard liberal response when you have no argument?
t1_dsl304z	0	*	That's because your question means zero to anyone. If your response to a question is a question it means you're A. Not confident enough to answer or B. A troll. Bye. 
t1_dxpbwcp	1	*	Ah, reminiscing ony Diablo 2 days, telling newbz this daily. 
t1_dslipup	1	*	holy shit. I didn't realize you could top off the previous comment but you did. I just can't pinpoint whats driving me crazy from your comments
t1_dslpwum	1	*	Aight then. Well be over here passing laws and accomplishing our agenda. You can whine on Reddit about it. 
t1_dsn4xz8	1	*	Actually it was the rural bias and America's poor model of election which allowed the person with less of the popular vote to take presidency  Also you assume the democrats are my party
t1_dslivgj	0	*	I didnt disappear. I just cant be bothered. 
t1_dskzpmn	1	*	Ah that makes a bit more sense then.  Every culture has different idioms.

t1_dsl9oqt	1	*	But you did? Lmfao
t1_dspqei6	1	*	I think it would feel like it's time to get a new job where my skills and personality are taken seriously. 
t1_dsli9al	1	*	By making comments like this because it's way, WAY easier than defending your point of view.   Logic and reason is hard.  Spiteful quips?  Well, even a Trumpist can pull that off. 
t1_dslwpgj	0	*	I don't have trouble believing that, but I'm also gonna have to ask for a source.
t1_dsl8ze4	0	*	Yeah judging by the economy and unemployment numbers were definitely headed for, the end of this country.  Oh how I long for Obamas sub 2% GDP!

t1_dsl24jq	1	*	Well I'll still present the facts, it's up to him to accept them at that point, besides there's other people reading this who need to see both sides.
t1_dslcd8w	0	*	Ideally Id like to work with the Dems, but that seems impossible considering their real choice for POTUS would have been an 80 year old Communist moron who has never had a real job.
t1_dsl5381	1	*	Got it. That makes sense. I was thinking in regards to Charizard in particular and not the title of the IP.
t1_dskzzsb	1	*	Wait.. who said it was?
t1_dsllz3e	1	*	That would require buying it off of Amazon.
t1_dsl91o8	0	*	I also admitted in my first reply to you that Trump fell for the red herring, thus admitting that he did indeed subscribe to birtherism.  Does someone chew your food for you, too?
t1_dslggse	1	*	Its only a safe space when you do it
t1_dskzni4	1	*	That doesn't surprise me at all.  Now tell me you're not racist because Muslims aren't a race and that I'm a brainwashed liberal snowflake who is wrong by default and you can complete the stereotype.
t1_dslcrtm	1	*	Necessarily? No. But he doesn't exactly have a massive repertoire to point to, either. 
t1_dsld6tl	1	*	Uhh how? 
t1_dskzbth	1	*	Credit downgrades do happen. It just happened to China. When you get downgraded your debt is worth less. It's not complicated. 
t1_dsapafo	0	*	You didn't do the same, otherwise you'd be me.

t1_dsa2byy	0	*	it isn't easy. I said it is possible and people do it.  its also not my responsibility to pay you more since you didn't decide it was worth doing something hard.
t1_dtwf14c	1	*	Selfishness is a value preached in the West but the US particularly
t1_dtv9874	1	*	Especially with the existence of smartphones lol. Like fucking hell dude you don't even have to be bored. Play candy crush or chess or some shit. There's wifi!

t1_dsm9d9i	0	*	Did it protest with little signs and a megaphone? 
t1_dsmbkzo	0	*	We're getting off topic.  So, about how you're making shit up and can't source it? Please? A study that states unobjectively that an animal is understanding pain?
t1_dsmjy8k	0	*	To be fair, you actually are aware when your immune system is fighting a virus, since that's what having a cold or fever is.
t1_dsn1bdf	0	*	So, daddy, do you keep kosher, or are you full of shit?  
t1_dsls6sg	0	*	Cruelty is cruelty, no matter the species. If you wouldnt want to be shot and killed, dont to it to other sentient beings. 
t1_dsodosc	0	*	Sure, its embarrassing how easily I took apart your nonsensical arguments and showed how wrong you where. 
t1_dupqm4h	0	*	That's certainly the impression I get from u/putinpaystrump
t1_dup866l	1	*	Don't really know what your point is. Hitler himself is confirming what his victims and enemies said and you still pretend it's not the correct course of action?
t1_duq1dkf	1	*	Jesus fucking Christ how is it possible for one person to be so disabled 
t1_dup86k4	0	*	What fascists acts do I condone, endorse or will probably commit?  Please cite the definition of fascism. It seems like you don't know what the word means.
t1_duqfndt	0	*	haha that's great I'm a racist for hating white supremacists.  Fuck off white boy.

t1_duprfmd	0	*	An adult with the understanding of a clueless innocent child. Cute.
t1_duq0kic	0	*	Closeted gay dude whos scared to tell people hes gay redirects his self hatred at his political enemies.  Basically antifa In a nutshell 
t1_duq4fkc	0	*	Ive seen a lot of skinny armed Antifa talk tough them scream assault and for the police when they get what they thought they have wanted 
t1_duprn7i	1	*	You batshit insane people are the real threat to the safety of people. You're nothing but a cult of violent thugs.
t1_dsai049	0	*	No one is saying they do so I'm not sure what your point is.  However, the US government could make a law that makes that practice illegal, so they do definitely have a say.
t1_du06s5e	0	*	In my experience,  a shitty plan is more detrimental than no plan at all, but you do you. 
t1_duprgq5	0	*	My responses have all been articulate, though-out responses, none of which were simply ad hominem attacks and were all supported by explanations and reasoning.
t1_dur8gk4	0	*	/r/repliesfoolsmake
t1_durl4s4	0	*	Name one. 
t1_dulxe4w	0	*	Yeah this about the war in the Middle East. No not that one, the other one. No not that one either, the other one. No, the other one. I said the other one.
t1_dunfb6t	1	*	Damn :( Can't blame you. My friends are considering as well. I really do wanna stay though and my plans so far are that as well but we don't know how worse it could be :(
t1_dulrv69	0	*	Have you seen the atrocities committed by the Cartels?
t1_duljmnt	0	*	oh please, don't go into the semantics game. if the war lasted 1 month, it was not a significant dispute.
t1_dulrid2	0	*	Well, U.S. anti-drug policies are heavily favorable to the cartels, leading them to primarily terrorize their own people.
t1_dum924j	0	*	Are you referencing the persian empire from a couple thousand years ago?  Lol.  Wut? 
t1_dum2yee	0	*	Get over it
t1_dum1pja	0	*	I feel sorry for you.  Youre the one who has to live with yourself every day. 
t1_dumlmmk	0	*	I feel the exact same way. Though I have american bias. Very rarely is someone truly subjective of their own country. I love australia btw
t1_dum9xma	0	*	Irrelevant countries don't get attacked by extremists and dragged into Asian land wars. 
t1_dulug45	0	*	I think he was just trying to draw a parallel with another conflict...

t1_dumm5f4	1	*	Nope, pointing out that what he did was nothing extraordinary. 
t1_dum1l7z	0	*	Both shared in the profits.
t1_dslb3it	0	*	You seriously think it's reasonable to assume the people of Haiti are of no value to the US based off some statistics?
t1_dt7slkj	1	*	So as it stands right now, they are producing nothing and would require a sizeable investment. Does anyone have a payback period for said investment? 
t1_duax9wu	0	*	I imagine driving a tank is too. 
t1_dua9jx6	0	*	>  I seriously don't even know how much I earn before taxes.   You accepted a job without knowing what the salary was? That seems a bit bizarre. 
t1_dua6kx4	0	*	Okay sure, stricter gun laws does not mean zero gun crime. But the average high schooler will have a much harder time getting a gun, meaning less shootings  It will not get rid of terrorism entirely 
t1_duajdyk	0	*	10 minutes for a hand gun? What state are you in?
t1_dua753b	0	*	Can you name a country other than the US in the **developed** world where people need guns for self defense?
t1_dua5mn3	1	*	They're already dealing with the cops, that are in the school building.  More gun control not hey let's give all the adults guns!
t1_dua6i9q	0	*	This is true. However, I'm not sure using the thing we want control on elected officials is the best way to get out point across.
t1_dubaxox	0	*	I live in New Jersey and the permits are on a hand gun by hand gun basis. So, basically it makes the time to purchase a new hand gun a week or so to process the paper work and get the approval.
t1_dua69yx	1	*	In my eyes its both
t1_dub6vyr	1	*	Okay, then I misinterpreted. I agree. We must make guns less accessible. Let's do that. 
t1_duc95eg	0	*	Crime rates in Australia didn't drop any moreso than they did in the US in the same period.
t1_duab8gs	0	*	Then that's not a great argument against the castle doctrine to be honest. He abused it and suffered the consequences.  What are y'all's magazines limited to? And how many are you allowed to own?
t1_ds7q9wg	0	*	Can I is though but thanks for being a dick about it, maybe all your debates turn out this  way for one reason, and its not the other person
t1_dtcvnge	1	*	To each his own.
t1_dse7554	0	*	They're even bigger shit holes than Saudi Arabia...
t1_dscwfkn	1	*	There was only one person carrying a Nazi flag and no one there knew who he was.
t1_dscoyxy	0	*	Definitely not disagreeing with you, just pointing out some families are pageant families and see it as a hobby.
t1_dscgeg4	0	*	> hy would other minorities make more money than the average?  Probably because they consited out of recent immigrants who had wealth and education which other minorities have been denied.
t1_dse5uc3	0	*	It's incredibly rare, and you have not seen it. 
t1_dscfniw	1	*	Can you even read? Or are you one of those people that believes in Europeans being in North America before Columbus? Mormon, maybe?
t1_dscixac	0	*	Judging by the down votes you got on your first comment, I'm not the only person who read it that way.
t1_dsck3ou	1	*	how old now?
t1_dsdwm3p	1	*	As you apparently missed, I was aware of that fact.
t1_dsco8ob	1	*	Don't see what Stalin has anything to do with this.
t1_dscdlek	0	*	>  the upbringing is more important, and authoritarian religious governments try to create cultures where children are brought up to believe such things.  Yeah, like Islam. 
t1_dsckoqo	0	*	You seem to have a whole lot less vitriol regarding the other religions you find more familiar. 
t1_dsc65k7	0	*	Same can be said about Christians, liberals, neo-cons or any religion or ideology. Singleing one out is just plain stupid.
t1_dscsk91	0	*	Patriotic is not the same as nationalistic. But 8f you need that explained to you odds are you're either a nationalist who is being purposefully obtuse, or just really thick. 
t1_dsecws4	1	*	Also, if ***all*** of the Arabs moved to Europe that'd be great because then we could just do the ol' switcheroo and all move there. 
t1_dsc1v0v	1	*	> It's not really an assumption  It is because there are people who refused to accept their parents religion even if the punishment was death. So until you know better you can't know for a fact.
t1_dsct9f4	1	*	kind of a huge generalisation in either case, finnish to russians to new zealanders barely share that much culturall nor do african americans nigerians and australian aboriginals...
t1_dsd8nle	1	*	Your hypocrisy is astounding.
t1_dse5oqy	1	*	And yet by every besides American black people (99% of the world's populace), they are considered black. 
t1_dsbyk1e	0	*	Nah, I'll just convert and collect tribute from you.
t1_dse9m5h	1	*	Obviously you weren't there.
t1_dscbs9a	1	*	Yes, we need to clarify whether OP is an identical or not. 
t1_dsc1inq	1	*	Thank you very much!
t1_dsd4bka	1	*	Well that flow is small enough to have no impact on the native population at large.
t1_dscxum1	0	*	What fucked up reality do you live in where sending death threats to a newborn baby because you're terrified of brown people rational?
t1_dsdjhl9	1	*	I've yet to see any real evidence that Nazism is becoming mainstream. I have seen the left work itself into a moral panic over the issue, however. 
t1_dsch5mp	0	*	Medieval is *pre* colonial. How can you be so blind? 
t1_dscxcag	1	*	> Being lied to your entire childhood can have pretty huge consequences too  I hate Santa.
t1_dsdf50q	0	*	>instead of offering your home and wife  You people are literally a sterotype. Get a fucking hold of yourself
t1_dsc9qs6	0	*	Duh.  Those links don't prove that white people are majority conservative like you claimed. Hence, useless.
t1_dscn72j	0	*	Also, race=/=ethnicity. White people are all white, but they can be of different ethnicities like Scottish and Irish.
t1_dscefwo	0	*	Is that why you feel qualified to state things as fact without any evidence? Seems easier to just make stuff up without taking the history lesson.
t1_dsc9s9t	1	*	Without a good amount of money you cant just move where in the world you want, especially if youre a migrant from the Middle East like they are
t1_dsbzfs0	0	*	That's contributing? I have no idea who that is.   Keep projecting your narrative on everyone. It's really healthy for you. You done it with each comment
t1_dsd72ny	1	*	Well that was a rollercoaster
t1_dscins9	1	*	Democracy is not a sign of achievement. It is merely a form of goverment. It came and it *will* go, given enough time, as every democracy that has ever existed before has.
t1_dscnfbm	1	*	> Did the Jews have a higher average income than Germans before the WW2?   German Jews were German.

t1_dukpnm3	0	*	something your lazy ass can look into ironic considering you posted a Wikipedia page as your source; literally the laziest way of looking info up.... Also not reliable, try again.
t1_dukjbbw	1	*	Absolutely. Good chat, take care. 
t1_dul9mlc	1	*	Sorry but wrong again.  Climate change is human caused. Plenty of scientific evidence. 
t1_dukapix	0	*	Find someone outside of the white house who thinks they're a good idea.
t1_dukdvvx	0	*	Semantics. 
t1_duke3zk	0	*	I *specifically* said lack of dangerous megafauna.
t1_duki06m	1	*	I didn't say any of that or make that argument.
t1_duknq6j	1	*	Or it is on all of us as citizens of this planet.
t1_dukbnuy	1	*	Are you my sister?
t1_dtgt8qj	0	*	Agreed, but you can't claim it died instantly when shooting it from a distance unless you nail a heart shot. 
t1_dtgt0z9	0	*	Maybe where you live... Not here where people raise their own cattle.
t1_dtgu85b	1	*	Did you bother reading any of the other posts?  
t1_dtgvxg4	0	*	Nah I dont kill endangered animals for fun, thats kinda the point.
t1_dtgvyd8	0	*	Nah, I dont care about you.
t1_dtgymzs	0	*	I'm not 100% sure what you're trying to say.
t1_duprb1b	1	*	I agree and disagree, we definitely cant compare them apples to apples. But at the same time we have deteriorating roads / bridges not being addressed in some major cities / areas
t1_dur6aj4	0	*	Ok, that makes sense. Would you do away with your government funded healthcare? 
t1_dv53m38	1	*	No you are wrong. It is not even close to among the lowest. Stop making excuses. 
t1_dupq7sp	0	*	Do you honestly believe it's this easy? I find it hard to believe anyone is this naive. 
t1_duqadxb	1	*	I know right, tunnels, sick burn.  Over 200 from shallow to elaborate been found since 90s. Lots of pictures of them on google machine, will still have border patrol with a wall, no doubt.
t1_dupu386	1	*	Ich will Springerle essen!
t1_dupnwa7	1	*	Well it's not an argument supporting immigration, is it? It's just saying well *you've* got more crime so you're a hypocrite!. 
t1_duprj2b	0	*	>10% of our population is 2nd or 3rd gen immigrant, and they study and work.  Who gives a fuck about Belgium though? I feel like you're commenting in the wrong thread. 
t1_dupj5yv	0	*	I have no stake in this argument...but I, for one, would like to hear your reasoning too.
t1_duqd60q	0	*	Call me in case History attacks.  Because i don't believe for a second that Russia wants to go to war with NATO. Doesn't matter how much the Americans put into their military.
t1_duq2i08	0	*	Now try 2000 (the start of the Energiewende) to 2017, the last year we have data from.  Is your argument really that bad that you have to cherry pick data?
t1_dupt28c	0	*	He calls himself a socialist. https://youtu.be/M_QLek6Qvzg
t1_dupkz3t	0	*	Okay so any opinion is propaganda? Are we only saying things that are 100% facts here now? That doesn't make discussion very fun or engaging.
t1_duq3wb5	1	*	Welp
t1_duq7l46	1	*	He claims he grew up during the Cold War, but he unironically made a comment where he assumes there are no baby boomer combat veterans, so I'm thinking he's actually under 18 for sure.
t1_durph9o	1	*	Like the United States 
t1_dupri9l	0	*	Yep. The population density may be higher than in the US, but Brandenburg and Saxony (not including Berlin, Leipzig, Dresden) are as rural as you can get in the context of the Internet. 
t1_duq1k8z	0	*	So you are a Marxist 
t1_dups0z5	0	*	Ja. Google.
t1_dups3im	1	*	Dieser alte Mann, er speilte einen.....
t1_duptnv3	1	*	DANKESCHxd6N!

t1_dupn5ou	1	*	Yup, agreed.
t1_duplm3a	1	*	You have yet to put up a proper argument other than BECAUSE!!!
t1_dupkww9	0	*	Was I replying to the 'several others'?  Have you filed your taxes yet for this year?
t1_duq9akl	1	*	My goalposts have always been the motivation, not the method. My original question was why, not how. You described how Russia might engage in this strategy, but not why.
t1_dupsukj	1	*	About 50 license plates per day. 
t1_dtnb01f	0	*	Ahh, the ol everyone who disagrees with me is dumb and everyone with evidence is lying-aroo. Good luck with that. 
t1_dtnwzld	0	*	I dont have issue with the indictments, those crimes were definitely committed, I dont see how they show there was collusion with trump and Russia.
t1_dtnnm4k	1	*	There is no evidence of collusion.  And it doesnt change what led to charges.
t1_ds6tyor	1	*	Oh boy.
t1_dt6lm2u	1	*	Yes, I wholeheartedly agree. I think Clement Attlee is probably the best PM this country has ever had. Maybe the best we'll ever have. 
t1_dt6qsx1	1	*	It's a pretty dumb thing to believe 
t1_dt6wfhq	0	*	It may be different but the effect is the same. It's semantic
t1_dt6tswi	0	*	Epee of course.   Interesting you didn't even list foil. Which is only correct because it's a vulgar, child's weapon. (/s) 
t1_dt6yuq5	0	*	What lead you to that conclusion?  I dont see anything that says that reflects that intention in OPs comment. 
t1_dt6lvwf	0	*	I will concede on pizza/calzones. For now. 
t1_dugzv2r	1	*	Obama was a centrist at best. Our left is right in many developed countries.
t1_dugv62y	1	*	Thoughts led directly to the action. Seriously dude, you're trying to use binary logic to understand and explain a hexadecimal issue. Leave the black and white thinking to the Republicans. 
t1_dugpqj4	0	*	Hear me out... maybe... just maybe... you could pull out your troops from somewhere they don't belong? That way nobody has to die.
t1_dugolbj	0	*	Oh yes, thats totally stripping away gay rights.  
t1_dugv9qu	1	*	30% of the population lives in 3 states. The numbers clearly favor small parts of the country from a numbers stand point. 
t1_dugz9aa	0	*	Its documented.  You wouldve probably hated bernie if there was as mich propaganda about him than there was about Hillary.
t1_dugw5sw	0	*	Population, not population density. 
t1_dugrmx1	0	*	You could call bombing the everliving shit out of areas with minimal concern for civilian casualties policy, I chose not to though.
t1_duguen8	0	*	It would be if popular vote was all that mattered.
t1_dugq4zi	0	*	I mean he seem to have won the election so.....   What have you done with your life that makes your opinion so much better than mine. 
t1_dugrbay	1	*	He's black, how dare he. Keep up dude.  /s
t1_dugqlm4	0	*	That's not how we elect presidents, we have an electoral college for a reason.  It's all documented, read up on it.
t1_duiwenr	0	*	Majority of illegals over stay their visas. They already enter legally.   A wall wont do shit. 
t1_dugvng9	0	*	By that logic a unicorn sounds like an ear of corn. 
t1_dugvxn6	0	*	Pm me when you get closer, happy to meet up for coffee. Or visit /r/NewZealand.
t1_dugx3r8	0	*	How is it not? Can you articulate your reasoning?
t1_dugyyf9	0	*	Thanks, that makes sense but it still favours two parties, doesn't it?
t1_duguhf4	0	*	May i just say mush, you guy have a fucked up legal system yeah we won't do you in for it, so long as the boss ain't looking. How the bloody hell does that even happy?    
t1_dupxd8o	0	*	( xb0  xb0) 
t1_duhalyu	1	*	Oh.  Yeah, I just didn't recognize it spelled out.
t1_dugrnx7	1	*	Did I say that I had no issue with sending troops to the middle east? 
t1_duh2t0s	0	*	A massive chunk of wahhabi terrorism at least.  The world is changing.  You just refuse to see it.
t1_duh9r8w	0	*	How can you agree when that directly contradicts your point?
t1_dugseb2	0	*	I think the people that ACTUALLY voted for Donald Trump are the ones that caused damage to our democracy.  But you can millennial bash if that helps fit your narrative.
t1_dugv6mh	0	*	So I should stand back, and passively offer *my* silent complicity to their abhorrent actions?
t1_dugwlhn	1	*	Thanks for the link. It's late here and I should sleep but I'll have a look in the morning, thanks for the information.
t1_dugst3b	1	*	Might as well not pour any fresh concrete, you're still trying to figure out where to set the goal post.
t1_duh2v3w	1	*	Great movie, a little dated, but still holds up.
t1_dugz80q	1	*	The point went over your head.
t1_dugsiyn	0	*	Because she was the more popular candidate?
t1_dugrz5x	1	*	Ah, so she did. How unfortunate 
t1_dugw6g7	1	*	No, that's Heroin.
t1_dugs5sl	0	*	Because more people voted for Hillary in the primaries
t1_dugsp6a	0	*	The NRA advocates gun safety, not gun violence by any stretch of the imagination. If were associating anything that involves guns with scheming promoters of violence, take a look at hip hop
t1_dugpk2i	1	*	Civilian deaths from world war 2 dwarf anything since.
t1_dt35kcx	1	*	Sorry, was on my phone and didn't notice.
t1_dt35j2l	1	*	I didn't say they were the same injury, just that the smallest thing can be deadly and the deadliest thing can be survivable.
t1_dt3ha2s	1	*	All I was saying was it depends on where you get shot with responsiveness after trauma. Nobody said headshot, you could easily shoot yourself in the heart also.
t1_dtmshgb	1	*	>  It cannot course correct during transit  Yea, they are working on that actually... 
t1_dsdim43	0	*	If by culture you mean systemic unfairness and inequality, then yes. But I suspect you used that word as thinly veiled way of blaming it on minorities.
t1_dtw5vx7	0	*	The reason they came forward is *because* he was about to be elected to the US Senate, and they didn't want that to happen to the creep that molested them. Does that not seem pretty intuitive?
t1_dty5sdc	0	*	> Who should pay for amd build the lifetime of facilities and the exercise equipment?  The state, which would be saving money compared to having to execute them.
