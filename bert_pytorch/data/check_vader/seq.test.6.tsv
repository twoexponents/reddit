t1_dup1g1f	-0.128000	*	They still have the Confederate battle flag on their state flag.  I think that tells you what they'd be like without the Federal government imposing progressive laws on them.
t1_duqorwy	0.401900	*	Corruption, smart guy. 
t1_dusjsoj	0.726400	*	Trump is as much a real conservative as my chances are scoring with 90s Heather Graham.  Good fucking god.
t1_duvvyxv	-0.584900	*	It must really fuck up your narrative that you are defending an admittedly authoritarian regime against someone who you believe is influenced by an authoritarian regime.
t1_dusz7lj	0.296000	*	Yeah that's why he wouldn't be on the internet...
t1_dv1ntjt	0.000000	*	Tanning spray and cheap gold housing trim. 
t1_dv0moeg	0.000000	*	The 2nd ensures the protection of the rest, thats why it was written. Fairly basic logic to follow.
t1_dv1vt9w	0.387500	*	How is this not a blatant violation of NAFTA in the first place? 
t1_dunsjiu	0.897900	*	I too care about my country, which was largely built be immigrants, and think that we should treat anyone who honestly wants to contribute to it with compassion.
t1_dundvxl	0.612400	*	That's a fair point, definitely. 
t1_duhwovz	-0.542300	*	I know, right? Someone needs to let socialists know that fuck you, give me yours isn't a sustainable basis for policy. Bunch of self-entitled pricks...

t1_dv3rvtl	-0.205700	*	I'm not certain I understand the question.  Are you asking how tariffs meant to shield and grow the U.S. steel industry are protecting workers?
t1_duqu0ie	-0.179600	*	I agree they should. Doesnt make communism any less horrible though 
t1_dumysk3	-0.359500	*	Your just biased about being unbiased!
t1_dujah16	0.440400	*	Is he really keeping appearances, though? If we're talking about it here, surely the whole world knows of his corruption by now.

t1_dv4i0cw	0.754300	*	No, just your lack of comprehension. I know they did, but as long as they denied NI citizen rights and freedom of travel, peace would not have been possible.
t1_duoggw4	0.000000	*	You do know they use a different alphabet right?  So misspelling a name means they're probably used to reading it in Cyrillic...

t1_dua54fs	0.038200	*	I won't leave you this time.
t1_dv02ogp	-0.325200	*	This isn't true at all. You could say that the Western governments are hyperpolarized towards capitalism. After all, that's what the Communists say/said.
t1_duhsiuc	0.726900	*	Singapore resident here, and I too, have never heard of a meal that cheap before.   Curious to know where such a godsend exists
t1_dv3izev	-0.874500	*	Chris Rock: I think people overlook what George Bush did for black history. Think about it. Bush was so bad, he gave us Obama. Trump is so bad, we're gonna get Jesus Christ.
t1_dug5sy7	-0.877900	*	This is why flying is my worst fear ugh 
t1_duh4kas	-0.636900	*	There are plenty of ways to spot trolls without choosing specific opinions. I disagree completely that that's inferred and I think the preachy comment I replied to is a holier than thou bunch of crap.
t1_duj08j7	0.666200	*	What is your take on this whole Russian meddling affair? And your opinion of Trump?   If you don't mind my asking. Just curious lol
t1_dv2j9cb	-0.690800	*	Willfully ignorant, looking for a fight, and proud of it. That last bit is the worst.

t1_duwk12u	-0.381800	*	The US for instance, with the drone strikes. Whether you call it freedom fighters, liberators or terrorists is mainly defined by if you're for or against the cause.
t1_duzc6dg	0.000000	*	He also said, I don't repeat myself; I don't repeat myself during a debate when Hillary said he repeats himself.
t1_duql0ep	-0.419900	*	Yeah, wait, I can get more time for possession than I can for conspiracy against the united states!?  I think something might be broken.

t1_dul61hs	-0.296000	*	no the triple lux has gold, diamonds *and fur*
t1_dudqze5	0.275500	*	That's not being lazy. Any doctor prescribing this type of medicine is doing so because they are getting something out of it (like more pharmacy rep lunches or something more sinister).

t1_dv024c1	0.034100	*	I don't think I sound indignant about it. And there's a lot of debate going on right now about which is happening in Myanmar to the Rohingya. No whiteys involved in that one.

t1_dusgclq	0.690800	*	The great thing about this comment is that both pro and anti Imperial folks will upvote it thinking it's supporting their side.
t1_dusjlay	-0.296000	*	No, that's incorrect.  Because....because... Because trump said Mexico are paying for the wall.
t1_dv0lp9a	-0.872100	*	You can call it what you want but you dont have free speech in France, sorry. You have Hate speech laws dude.

t1_ducxq7c	0.350600	*	Yeah definitely, but the point above was that the indicted Russians would work with the FBI, which is...optimistic 
t1_dunp9ew	-0.831600	*	American liberalism is neoliberalism. Neoliberalism needs to die a graphic and public death, and soon.

t1_duldvjh	-0.399900	*	Doubt it, if they're not embarrassed at the shit they've done until now, they'll just cheer at how brave Pence was in the face of evil.

t1_dv0qpw7	0.122500	*	The issue isn't that the uneducated get to decide, that's just fucking democracy, and it's good.  The issue is that the uneducated do not want to be educated in areas they have no knowledge about.

t1_dv37jnd	-0.177900	*	To be fair people who are pro trump from that sub get banned from other subs for the same type of posts. How does anybody expect to have discourse if they are banning each other?

t1_ducx75a	0.000000	*	I stayed home rather than vote for Clinton, but that didn't particularly make a difference in Massachusetts. 
t1_dv27pft	0.000000	*	As a German who grew up having a yearly subscription for 4 crates of Florida oranges delivered to our door in Germany, and later moving to Florida for work.... I can confirm,big deal! 
t1_dun0rit	-0.876700	*	Why do you think this isn't my real account? How do you even make fake accounts?  Way to derail the discussion with unimportant theories.. Even if my account was fake, the claim talks for itself.
t1_duut9wx	-0.638100	*	How in the actual fuck...  Isn't he like 10 times worse than Trump?
t1_dujsg90	0.014600	*	So it's ok for the government to decide when it's ok for me to die? That should be up to the parents of this child, not some court.

t1_dunb3ya	0.657100	*	That is fascinating!!!  I studied under an anthropologist who worked on Kenyan informal economies. Bandit is an incredibly poignant way to put this. Similar to modern day pirate 
t1_duyigne	0.000000	*	republicans have to
t1_dv36f45	-0.923100	*	Barry Goldwater was right wing. Authoritarian attitudes (thinly veiled death threats, support for domestic terrorism, hate speech) dont exist on a political spectrum. 
t1_duyso0l	0.038700	*	> how to avoid sounding like your typical hotdog vendor  I don't know what hotdog vendors you've been to, but the ones I've interacted with don't ramble incoherently.

t1_dubum8i	0.361200	*	Looks like you're talking of the jihadists  
t1_duq547k	0.726900	*	Only decades if you dont elect better govt in the next two cycles. Right now youre only about 1.5 years behind, not decades. And the US still has the economic clout to catch up if you care to.
t1_duey42m	-0.296000	*	No, it's reality.
t1_duj4hbs	0.484700	*	Australia already has running desalination plants. We're not going to die of thirst as a species, we just have to get thirsty enough to actually do something about it.

t1_duy2lzp	0.557400	*	We do, and probably a huge number of them shoot competitive. But they use special guns- not suitable for hunting
t1_dunmv42	0.620800	*	Oh right, so here, they are using it kind of like a slang, right? Like Oppa to someone older. Calling her little sibling to kind of emphasize the inequality?
t1_dun5yv3	-0.241100	*	Although that doesn't include the homeless, because they don't pay taxes. Or are you suggesting that the homeless shouldn't get help?
t1_dv14owl	0.778300	*	Show was amazing though. Glad to see people still talk about it.
t1_dv2pgfr	-0.526700	*	Aggressively ignorant fits.  I'm in a red county in NC.
t1_duqm8j4	-0.338400	*	I mean, if you have an in for catching the bigger fish, probably.  There's also an addendum that Mueller can add on more charges at a later date, so.

t1_dubjxh7	-0.144000	*	Are you suggesting that I'm suggesting personal agreement with the point of view of these 2nd amendment nuts? Explaining their view does not equal that I subscribe to their idea.  So short answer: no

t1_dudqysx	0.648600	*	It certainly should be a thing. Medicine shouldn't really be for corporate profits.
t1_duw3kmw	-0.340000	*	Can we spare Sanders though?  There are a few gems out there. Unfortunately they are heavily outnumbered... =(
t1_durp6fc	0.000000	*	When a country has 1/10 the population of another... there are bound to be less massacres or shootings.
t1_dv4mjxb	0.927300	*	Yes, it is beneficial short distant wise. Healthy and more enjoyable than car ride for me. How do make it more long distance?

t1_duc9con	0.655300	*	Maybe because driving a car is a privilege, not a right? Kind of like having a child vs adopting one?   Just a thought. 
t1_dud51s1	-0.273200	*	I can use that same logic with the Steele Dossier that Hillary paid for if you want to argue that.
t1_dulk6io	0.318200	*	To be fair, unless the guy actually took any kind of action against them. It doesn't mean much what he said or thought.

t1_dupdpqq	0.526700	*	They do, this thread is about armenian genocide.  If everyone waits to right their wrongdoings until everyone else does then justice will conveniently never get served.  This is your goal
t1_duh2oyz	-0.338200	*	My politician is better than yours! Nah just kidding, they are all slimy bastards.
t1_dugkc5n	-0.624000	*	I'm not expecting some result. I'm just getting fucking annoyed that people keep fucking the rest of us over for no reason. 
t1_dudr44j	0.000000	*	Modern Greece and modern Germany have very little to do with the ancient Greeks or Germanic tribes. Both areas have changed people's, changed cultures, been invaded and ruled by non-natives, etc.
t1_dv1u8v6	0.153100	*	Sucks for the states involved, but a great way to minimize collateral damage. Direct the impact towards the specific people you need to influence.

t1_dv0tjts	-0.128000	*	I vaguely remember hearing about it.  No source though.  I have a reply with a bad link above, so unless I can source it it's just heresay at best.

t1_dujdo1d	0.700300	*	Well yes, hence me liking her for those reasons. Weird if it wasn't the case, eh?

t1_dulg3rx	-0.177900	*	Hell, SCIENCE and religion went hand in hand. When the most readily available source of literate people in the world with lots of free time were men of religion, no shit.

t1_duwtpd3	0.612400	*	We have a saying here in America- your nurse is the only heart your doctor has.   (Its a blanket statement- we have wonderful, caring docs as well, but a lot of them can be full of themselves.) 
t1_durfk9q	0.077200	*	Commodore Perry is Japanese apologetics' go-to excuse. 
t1_dur7pfx	0.102700	*	This guilt you speak of does not exist, people who have never been to Germany like to use that idea though.

t1_duz9ut4	0.296000	*	Not even this, Belarus is already de facto part of Russian and even without one vacation of unaligned mechanized infantry, artillery, and air support they would still vote to join Russia
t1_dusjako	0.615400	*	Considering we *used* to be on top, and have been plummeting in every category satire is just sad.  Not surprised though, dolan posters like yourself don't give a shit if the country falters

t1_dumvas0	0.814400	*	Id rather my kid spend 180+ days a year in a room without a gun than with a superior who is holds domain over them and also has a firearm. Easy answer.

t1_duh6eis	-0.846700	*	Because you are spouting a stupid meme, or you seriously think they are a Russian being paid to post on reddit. Im not sure which is worse.
t1_durjclh	-0.341200	*	A budget surplus doesn't necessarily earmark good economic management. Not that we're making the most of our expenditure, however. 
t1_dulmli7	-0.855500	*	Uh, Israel  sells itself as fighters of racism and apartheid while they're actually purveyors of racism and apartheid?
t1_duuote1	0.800000	*	> The current young generation is the first one who's had internet since the start and they, for the most part, seem well equipped with the ability to know truth from fiction.   Joke of the year.

t1_dv3vc75	-0.814100	*	I think saving the species is the right choice, but I dont see how its not natural selection.  If a monkey throws a rock or an Orca kills for fun is it no longer natural selection?

t1_dub94e3	-0.877500	*	What more gun control policies are there to propose? A gun store owner can literally choose to not sell someone a firearm because they get a bad vibe from the person, no questions asked.

t1_duqdnz8	-0.296000	*	Due to the demographics of that 30%, if nothing else we can wait for them to die out. Sometimes the stagnation in life expectancies, especially in places where those 30% live, works on our favor.
t1_dugv5kb	-0.729700	*	Fuck off and stay in Canada then. Must be easy to ride the coattails of the biggest world power. Justin Trudeau saying its 'peoplekind' the world took notice that your PM is a BITCH

t1_duuqtjb	-0.273200	*	The dairy articles proves my point that, if anything, food prices should be higher.  Government subsidies are keeping many food prices artificially low.

t1_duyzgap	0.700300	*	In the same way you or I would keep a dog, Putin has the President of the United States.  Honestly, at this point, if Ivanka wasn't a plant from the beginning I'll eat a hat.

t1_durnau6	-0.318200	*	As a history buff and homo sentient, I can say that I hated Russian history and culture long before Reddit. When Russians decide to be good people en masse, then I will think higher of them.

t1_duskx38	0.620400	*	What makes you think any of those things are okay or anything that I would be fine with. Just because it happens among citizens doesn't mean we should let them bring in even more drugs as well. 
t1_dua9dmk	0.597500	*	Not a drain, but there are areas in the UK that Westminster hasn't done shit for while the EU did.

t1_duq9cdx	-0.762800	*	 Hate to tell you this but it seems you can't handle the truth. You'll never accept it. 
t1_duv5ys0	-0.275500	*	It's a turn of phrase. Are you a native English speaker?  Obviously I don't like it.
t1_dupiewz	-0.381800	*	Lol every time a defenseless country gets attacked, we get the why aren't you doing anything from their leaders.

t1_dui8d4v	0.200300	*	You have to work within the system to change it! It's going to take many campaigns financed by citizens, rich or poor, to enact legislation for public financing.
t1_duahnxc	0.778300	*	Best thing for snow removal is a sled shovel. I can clear my (rather large) driveway in about 8 minutes.
t1_dv0aey0	-0.077200	*	I mean youre paying for the ranger and maintenance services either directly or indirectly. Those people arent doing that shit for free.

t1_dup40io	-0.784500	*	> Has that been proven already? He did say to kill his son if his son was indeed part of any drug dealing ring.  No.  Because the government's essentially shutting down any investigations.

t1_dudnfna	0.361200	*	For starters, race is not the first word in the title. Race is not emphasized. I used StarWars as an example of what a movie that does being people together looks like. 
t1_dugtgqa	-0.624900	*	I only brought them up because its the closest thing we have to a public version of disaster aid that is international. Here in the states we have the national guard and they rock.

t1_dum3fp0	-0.812600	*	The Israelis also jammed US frequencies specific to the military. They knew which frequencies to jam because they knew it was a US ship. The israelis also shot US lifeboats in the water. A war crime.

t1_duppego	-0.226300	*	Also, of course the Holocaust had something to do with Israel. Israel was born 3 years after the Holocaust stopped. You think that wasn't on Jewish people's minds?
t1_dum59gi	-0.144100	*	Yeah, I'm just joking. You can't properly compare safety of American schools to safety of Nigerian schools in the country side. 
t1_duizipu	-0.506700	*	Lock her up! Lock her up! Lock her up!  Not surprising considering that jailing his political enemy was a campaign point for President Trump.

t1_dv39g2b	-0.825800	*	The News is full of ant-Trump propaganda yet you still couldn't win. Maybe it was your shitty candidate.
t1_dv299xw	0.000000	*	Nobody knew international trade could be so complicated
t1_dv0omus	0.659700	*	Well, yea. It's our right to bear arms that protects our freedom of speech.  What's happening here is the French government is restricting freedom of speech by threat of gun. 
t1_dubxp8n	0.585900	*	The only thing that seems reasonable in that analogy is that the US indeed seems to work towards war... and it really doesn't have any other way to win.
t1_dufhvrl	0.000000	*	You outright called him a troll, and a few comments previous you were appealing for people not to call names.

t1_duyn7eo	0.438000	*	But Obama had regular YouTube videos, which is a much more appropriate comparison.  trump's tweets are nothing but insane ramblings.  They're letters to the editor

t1_duxr4qy	0.774100	*	Less freedom = more safety ... right? 
t1_duphzfy	0.165500	*	Well yes, but it's based on a real thing. Back in the late 70s-early 80s it was discovered that the US military was spending outrageous sums for ordinary things like the aforementioned.
t1_dv3c2w0	0.000000	*	You are probably right. I don't know why the EU targets jeans, motorcycles and bourbon. There must be a reason. Are these products made in swing states?

t1_duw1o0c	0.868900	*	Clearly floods only begun post 1999 and have never happened before.   I'm pretty sure those scientists were talking about melting ice causing the oceans to swallow us alive

t1_duxyglh	-0.712000	*	No, the economy in general. Terrorism is extremely rare, regardless. Finally, women fleeing oppressive regimes are very rarely terrorists.

t1_durpvfg	-0.695600	*	Sorry, in the US we don't let people punch us in the eye and get away with it. We ignore a lot, but direct attacks on our troops need to be paid back in blood.
t1_dupb3jb	0.836000	*	LA wants a max tax rate of 40%, and removing the marginal tax rate of ~56%. By American standards that's pretty unambitious for a right-wing party :)

t1_dv4qf1b	0.824700	*	Yeah and as a corrupt person she needs to look like a winner.  Infantilizing her would be saying she'd never leave because she's too dependant.
t1_dunk522	0.683500	*	But that's making the assumption that today's free press doesn't have their own biases, their own agendas, and isn't driven by profit. Media is in a HUGE conflict of interest position.

t1_duqamjl	-0.177900	*	To be fair, it is relevant if true. The problem with it is that it's 100% whataboutism and doesn't even attempt to right a wrong just because 'b-b-but Hillary'.

t1_duq7ji9	-0.462700	*	what the fuck is a fraud-zo?  I did read it through an archive page.  And the independent is a glorified inquisitor so I'm kinda even disappointed in myself for taking the click bait.

t1_dupi6ol	0.743000	*	Correct, they spend 1.2% of their GDP on NATO defense. That doesnt make them freeloaders, and its certainly not a reason for the US to leave NATO, which is a huge boon to international security.

t1_dugq5md	0.318200	*	To be fair, conservatives say the same of liberals, hence the term libtard.  The US seems too divided today.  Its rather concerning.

t1_duf6559	0.440400	*	All I did was skip the first part about them supporting Bernie because it was something I read on Fox News and had nothing else to back it up with. Other than that it follows your rebuttal in suit.
t1_due4y5k	-0.373600	*	I dont think supermarkets should be doing what they can. Their job is to sell stuff not pass moral judgements.  What's next? Going to say no one can buy fried stuff under 49 years old?

t1_dv018z4	-0.777800	*	The refugees that the Trump admin has been refusing also spoke English and were heavily vetted. Really shocked to see this level of ignorance from a T_D poster.

t1_duq0ghn	-0.971200	*	Because sexual assault has a broad definition but in the average person's mind they connect assault with physical violence and assume it means rape with some form of penetration. 
t1_dv0px2f	-0.526700	*	> Britt's  This hurt me
t1_dunz8z6	0.547300	*	LOL, with that rational you could tie it all back to WW1 and the fall of the Ottoman Empire. 
t1_duxi5cp	0.295500	*	He's trying to push his own, strange agenda, you're not being dishonest, he is being intentionally obtuse.

t1_dv2zkr5	0.436400	*	No? I upvoted you and was trying to explain why people are so hasty to bash libertarians. But if makes you feel better I can pretend your very obvious joke went over my head. 
t1_dujo4tf	0.318200	*	If what comes out of California's colleges is to be held as the Democrat / liberal standard, I'm pretty sure I'd take uneducated over that hateful and unemployable alternative.
t1_dus22cq	-0.493900	*	Learn how to read, moron.
t1_dugddde	0.202300	*	Huh, I didn't know that. I was under the impression that it's horse tranquilizer. Do you know what it's used for in human medicine? 
t1_dv043qa	0.128000	*	Sure, but it's hard to manage wealth well when you have none to begin with, due to past racist policies.
t1_duujefy	0.792800	*	Sadly gas explosions do occur on quite a regular basis where natural gas is used for heating/ cooking (as in a large number of UK residences). Luckily they don't normally kill people. 
t1_dur4ab7	0.381800	*	The gates foundation does have a US program which is focused on education, particularly in Washington state.

t1_dumlv89	-0.755900	*	>Education shouldn't push values I don't like, especially the political ones.  We sure as fuck don't pay for indoctrination. No exceptions should be made to the rules on political grounds.
t1_duqasv2	0.000000	*	It can all be undone and halted if people get out and vote. Not just this year, **every fucking year**. Do not let them claw their way back. 
t1_dukvgog	-0.051600	*	Puerto Rico is a sovereign territory. It's not the federal government's responsibility to save them from their own stupid decisions any more than its Texas or New York's responsibility.

t1_dv1pd1f	0.458800	*	An explicit, open retaliation which was intelligently targeted at an acting President is very different than covertly spreading false propaganda...
t1_duix45n	-0.557400	*	You just need to look at the nine dash line map to understand China is full of shit on this topic
t1_dubtdpc	-0.438900	*	Too expensive. We can just have all the lowest ranked soldiers eat the grass instead!
t1_dv10j4h	-0.296000	*	They let women walk down the street showing their face in SS Chicago. Can you say the same about Germany no go zones?
t1_duxnc19	0.929100	*	I have never heard that before. It's amazing what people will do to convince themselves that it's OK to just do what they want to do. Thanks for sharing. 
t1_duylcs0	-0.440400	*	Because he is correct in saying that the US hasn't adequately compensated slaves, either, and only offered some meaningless words (which Japan has offered, too).
t1_dum7w5s	-0.700300	*	No, these are illegal immigrants.
t1_duugkcx	-0.759700	*	This is Reddit. They'll continue to believe this nonsense about whites being persecuted in South Africa no matter what.
t1_dugbjb1	0.000000	*	A tool for farming sugar
t1_dv18fi2	0.894500	*	I love Obama, but he pretty much got it for just not being Bush. I suppose by that criteria, not being Trump is a good enough reason.

t1_dudd7o7	0.000000	*	Which is exactly what is happening right now. 
t1_dv17u4t	0.077200	*	Yes almost half a century ago there were actual disadvantages. Nowdays there's only advantages if you're black. Lower SAT scores to get into college/affirmative action/etc. Nowdays it's a choice.

t1_duhzx3r	-0.390900	*	When you're desperate you don't really care anymore what happens. I'd like to see the nay sayers go without a job, a paycheck, and a hot meal for three months and then stay level-headed about it.
t1_dv0rlqe	0.000000	*	You do realize that philosophy is basically the core of science? Philosophy is basically making sense of everything science told us and asking more questions for science to answer. 
t1_dv37sid	0.743000	*	That's an amazing compilation, thank you so much.
t1_duj3ew0	0.557400	*	Seems interesting, I'll probably wait a couple years for it to cool down and more info to be out so I can read about it without that much outside bias.
t1_dv44rxs	0.340000	*	RFA has on multiple occasions claimed that they source their information from these innocent people related to them.
t1_dua8xsx	0.361200	*	Lol, are you serious?

t1_duxsl9o	-0.051600	*	the irony is that most of the people that are shilling here are actually expats and not even Chinese
t1_dufqjwx	-0.401900	*	You're right, that's what Interpol is for. If they cross a border anywhere, they will be identified and detained on request of the US Govt. FBI sends a notice to Interpol and it's done from there.
t1_duj4cek	0.051600	*	Damn I'll have to sell my gf to poland as a marriage gift 
t1_duzwbo7	0.226300	*	Youre right. There has been no paradise on earth. Not by any means. But by most measures , Africa is not one of the better places to live    You whites ?  Racist.

t1_duane8v	0.350600	*	Uruguay has humid subtropical climate  I'd rather live under fascism than put up with that bullshit every day, but thanks anyway
t1_dui6hq6	-0.750600	*	Was the vote rigged in some manner? Boycotting elections only really makes sense when the vote has been rigged and you want to voice that you do not approve of it. 
t1_duaip55	0.340000	*	I know, I was agreeing with you...and I was downvoted for it...and I included facts...fuck me right?
t1_dugnapv	0.000000	*	Noted.
t1_dukc1u6	0.675200	*	but at the same time that's kind of a John Galt move so they might respect you more?

t1_dusgyj3	-0.542300	*	PFFFFF hahaha a war against america, it would take nearly all of europe to beat us. Obviously I was kidding but who would be insane enough to invade the us.

t1_dumd9ru	-0.077200	*	The problem is in this case the left lost and Trump won. How is talking sense to him turning out? Maybe that way of thinking is flawed. Maybe you should find an alternative.

t1_dv2r738	-0.432300	*	That's all u think he had access to? Fucking moron. Anyone can get weapons.  It's the intent not the so called facts. U low life. Hope your kids are smarter than u. 
t1_dus0x59	0.421500	*	You didn't practice right, then. In my experience, Theory holds so long as people have faith and don't try to game the system.

t1_dundn1b	-0.628900	*	The walking and eating/drinking thing. Really? That's kind of cool. Do you know why it's considered rude? Is it just plain old impolite?

t1_duwok8j	0.401900	*	Pretty ironic comment considering that the main goal of this restructuring was to try to shift services towards private practices.... But hey, gotta throw that political agenda around somehow right?

t1_duumrol	-0.296000	*	> Romans did to Anglo Saxons  Uh no. Romans did that to the celts. Anglo Saxons didn't have much contact with the romans. Anglo saxons arrived in britain long after the romans left.

t1_duqauf1	-0.735100	*	Even then, though. Being able to launch a propaganda campaign to confuse dumb people doesn't make you a superpower; it's just going to make Russia even more of a pariah, with less global influence.

t1_duk7qd6	-0.771700	*	its not.  You can keep screaming that it is, but firing the FBI director does not make any investigations stop.  Do some research and take a look. 
t1_dush7eq	0.000000	*	or maybe ai is more civilized than republicans
t1_duep75p	0.873200	*	Well I honestly can't say about the financial side, but I believe we should be promoting a more united world and leaving our existing Unions seems vastly counter-productive in that sense.
t1_dun5e9p	-0.580300	*	What propaganda did CTR push?  Did you consider that they might have just been trying to combat the constant flow of trash this post is actually about?

t1_duno5i9	0.387500	*	I'm not blaming him at all, just pointing out how they don't hold him to the same standards as Trump. Obama and Trump could do the same exact thing and the reaction would be immensely different. 
t1_dv33fcc	0.536200	*	Whats IC? Intelligence collecting?
t1_dv0072i	-0.458800	*	The genocide could've continued to escalate and when it ended the country could've languished in poverty. There are lots of problems, social and economic, but it's on the upswing.

t1_dui5ndl	-0.717500	*	yeah I know sorry, was a shitty thing to say, but some of the comments in this thread a really disheartening. 
t1_dv1pe05	-0.296000	*	Yeah, because the Nazis thankfully lost the war, and thus were unable to carry out their plans in full.
t1_duruu5b	-0.362600	*	The US didn't target civilians. The US targeted strategic cities and civilians died. That's a very important distinction.
t1_dukbqvk	0.648600	*	That has nothing to do with the question that was asked.  You earned yourself a whoosh as well my friend
t1_dut5o7e	0.784500	*	Nah, it's because the ratio of Presidents shot in the face versus innocent schoolchildren shot in the face is pretty skewed in favor of the Presidents. 
t1_dur30a0	0.418400	*	But... but...      Over in r/futurism China is leading the world in green fuels!!      Lol, I'm just kidding. I know r/futurism is a Tianya Club propaganda sub.

t1_duvcb8o	0.190100	*	Agree but you link is not working on mobile. 
t1_duyijnp	0.025800	*	Anyone can if the matter pertains to them. In this case it's Trump's own verified account.

t1_dus4oxg	-0.557400	*	Nah, only fall damage and environmental hazards work against someone with diplomatic invincibility. I suppose at least one of those two things would be highly likely in Australia. 
t1_dup94eg	-0.341200	*	But that's one of the reason why he is unpopular in most other countries. Copying Trump's behaviour isn't a good thing.
t1_duidglf	-0.525600	*	If only. They have a lot of thoughts -- quite dangerous ones, in fact.
t1_dv3z57g	-0.380200	*	> to not admit anything is wrong.  Exactly. Like the people who try to pretend that colonialism doesnt have any lasting effects.

t1_dv0j3vc	0.000000	*	Whats your point?
t1_dv03szk	-0.653100	*	Do you legit think that every ethnicity hates white people? That no one *other* than whites want equality? That a black person doesnt have the capacity to recognize the issues with this?

t1_duvbk6x	-0.289200	*	I'm sure there is. I think it's more an educational thing. Even if there wasn't legal repercussions against it, many educated people would know that what they're doing was terrible.

t1_duuitwp	-0.750600	*	Perfect example of this was that a crazy homeless muslim attacked people with a knife in  the same 3 days as the Las Vegas shooting. Guess who were branded a terrorist and who were not.

t1_duzzrmh	0.049800	*	Lmao, it was ONE family that was denied refuge. Because some people found their evidence of prosecution questionable.   But I know you from r/Canada, I wouldn't expect you to be completely honest.

t1_dut4r2x	-0.141900	*	Isn't Reddit like only 40% of Reddit American now? We're still the plurality but that wouldn't be most.

t1_duwq6qp	-0.151100	*	Can't the party just vote out the president if they don't want him? It's not that difficult if that's what they want.

t1_dupp758	0.038700	*	I don't know, but given how it is being used I could definitely see it. I think nearly all academics would dislike their work being skewed for political purpose they never intended.

t1_duqsxqa	0.128000	*	Oh, asset consolidation and wealth inequality will be our downfall. And it's like we all know it, but it's a split on who the blame falls on.

t1_duz4wdf	-0.141900	*	Is it not? Maybe not exactly like that but a larger alberta surplus will incentivize the Government to look there if there is a budget hole to fill...

t1_duck7oq	-0.936700	*	That's because they just kill anyone who disagrees. You wouldn't hear about them most of them. Shit they kidnapped the figure head of an entire religion because fuck that religion, that's why.

t1_duz2lxj	-0.057200	*	He always feels the need to comment on what he's literally just said a second ago. He does this so often that he can never finish a sentence. 
t1_duw0cjh	-0.700300	*	I would also add 'stop buying shit you don't really need'
t1_dv02xe7	0.000000	*	Word!!!

t1_duq5k2h	0.476700	*	Just looked at polls for his approval rating. It's higher than america. I wouldn't be so quick to judge.
t1_duuovf9	0.421500	*	One could argue the imperial system adds up, too. Just in a way that directly leads to freedom and pet bald eagles.
t1_dv05oxj	0.000000	*	He's not the opposition leader, he got 10% in the last vote. He also said that nobody is getting their homes or lands taken away, but i suppose it doesn't suit your agenda to quote that
t1_duyjf7b	0.000000	*	48:10
t1_dv1gypr	0.542300	*	Oh, well yeah, then no skills whatsoever that would be of value to society...... /s
t1_duxyh3o	0.296000	*	Does creating and enforcing economic sanctions count as doing nothing now?
t1_dufapj4	0.273200	*	He'd do well on r/enlightenedcentrism 
t1_dumhngb	0.510600	*	Let's be honest here, they have a bunch of names in a hat, and they draw one. Every naming convention they have has a one-off or an exception.  
t1_dued55a	-0.541100	*	>Dozens of dollars in damage!  are you actually such a sourpuss?
t1_dutdlki	-0.836100	*	Do you fear your physical security to be threatened by the state? If not then don't trivialize the China matter with your Trump shit.
t1_dufq2q5	-0.476700	*	Ok i'm aware of that, but why is what happens in the US relevant to a law being proposed in Iceland (I'm guilty also of wording my question poorly)?
t1_dufhx0n	0.492600	*	Youre the good boy!
t1_dugru39	0.273200	*	Well, that's subjective.

t1_duhp7sk	0.000000	*	> as the differences between Christianity 1,000 years ago and now are staggering.  Because of the last half of the last century of that time scale. 
t1_dv0voh0	0.508000	*	Oh so the implication is Trump sent in his own?! That is hilarious!
t1_duyj3d6	-0.638100	*	Your thinking is dangerous. If people can't agree then they're unreasonable. 
t1_duicuf0	0.000000	*	Didn't say I wanted to deconvert anybody.
t1_dv0yqvm	0.000000	*	Which is completely irrelevant to the point he was making.

t1_duqmhyq	-0.458800	*	Forget the weed dealers, people with less than an eighth get lost in the system and serve longer sentences cause of it. 
t1_duwzewj	-0.802000	*	How would that be any different than it is now? The War On Drugs is a failure, people still do drugs. Decriminalizing them wont cause more people to do more drugs.
t1_dv37jqo	0.401900	*	Yes, you tried.  A salami lick-em brother
t1_dubdvnm	0.817600	*	No matter how many bots you think the Russians have, it looked like Hillary was sliding into a free win.  I guess those Russians also figured out how to get their bots to vote in swing states.
t1_dv1lfw8	0.510600	*	You mean they negotiate. Pretty sure its better than current government. I left Canada because of how bad the economy is, and looks like things just keep getting worse under current government. 
t1_dv2ya19	-0.476700	*	Sad to wipe out a horn just to get a horn though. 
t1_dukvhm9	0.361200	*	You can go wherever you like buddy

t1_duykkxp	-0.855500	*	I've only heard that they pissed on the bed.  Can you link to where it's alleged they pissed on Trump too?
t1_dueuoyr	-0.557400	*	Nope, I died. 
t1_dv45bx1	-0.077200	*	Or not. NATO  will be too near to Russia and there will be no buffer zone, also Russia will newer allow it.
t1_ducqnv5	-0.381800	*	its about pitting measures in place to prevent it from happening in future elections.  trump refuses to even acknowledge its a problem.

t1_duq9f5s	0.273200	*	Well if they're donating money then the campaigns should be checking where that money is coming from, so basically the headline of this thread.
t1_duqjl57	0.000000	*	yet it is a minority of adult americans.
t1_duvlsqy	0.590400	*	FYI you're responding to 1-day-old account whose whole post history is about defending defending Assad and how Russian trolls supported Bernie rather than you know who. Sounds legit.

t1_dv1xnh0	0.557400	*	well thats like just your opinion man.
t1_duthsb7	0.709600	*	I'll just let my kids play around in a landfill to strengthen their immune systems.  It's cheaper.
t1_dutjsja	0.000000	*	yeah how about you stop that
t1_dutgvv7	0.102700	*	I don't know why you think I like Venezuela. A socialist population voted themselves socialist policies and collapsed the economy.

t1_dv40n68	0.636400	*	Yeah. A cult that half of voters are in. That's not a cult.  Look dude, you may not like Trump, I get that, I respect that, but it certainly isn't a cult.

t1_dujlid8	-0.659900	*	> The scientific method gave us  Asbestos, BPA in our drinks, lies about smoking, lies about sugar, etc.  There's plenty of reasons to not trust scientists who say that something is safe.  
t1_dujzy14	0.000000	*	Still waiting for a morsel of evidence the Russians had a single thing to do with the election outcome. Mueller hasn't found any. Maybe you know something he doesn't. 
t1_du9vaab	-0.177900	*	Well this is London not Dunedin NZ, where housing prices are ridiculously high and having a job does not imply that you'd have enough to pay rent and feed yourself
t1_duhesw0	-0.916900	*	Hes not talking about Kennedy-style assassinations. Hes talking about assassinations on foreign soil.  A guest gets killed after you invite them into your home and it gets awkward fast. 
t1_duebjpg	0.827100	*	Yes. One that advised the UK Government that the people's wish was to be out of the EU.  Be careful what you wish for.

t1_dupv9me	-0.642800	*	I dont think it was supposed to be a jab towards gun laws, but just pointing out that the political arguments we have are peanuts compared to what these guys go through.
t1_duukkqw	-0.807400	*	Collosal waste of money while nuclear weapons exist. Even a pathetic joke of a country like north korea can threaten America with nukes. Imagine if that had been spent on infrastructure.

t1_duqmcli	0.487700	*	It's really about how useful you are. They needed his testimony so they gave him a plea deal.
t1_duegp6t	-0.361200	*	I would wager on none of them being indicted and Flynn beating something in an appeal or whatever legal avenue is open to him, given the recent text messages of the agent who interviewed him.

t1_duok0wx	0.414400	*	I'm no authority on the matter so it most scholars think so then I'll trust their judgement. I got the idea from an article I read a long time ago.
t1_dubgkzj	0.822500	*	The hindsight of backing a one in a million dark horse isn't savviness, it's just luck. That's how gamblers lose everything they gain when they think their first win is anything more than that.

t1_duv6jgt	-0.318200	*	Nothing, we just do it differently than them. It's mainly only Italians who get all bothered by it. Everyone has their own way of doing things. 
t1_dugclp3	-0.631000	*	Most of Israel isn't, but for the people living in Gaza and the West bank it is likely worse than third world. 
t1_dux3c29	-0.340000	*	What's extra intetesting, is that this plane landed in Thailand hours before the prostitute turned escort to Oleg Deripaska was jailed....in Thailand....for overstaying her visit in Thailand... :/

t1_dujk6gv	0.226300	*	Oh that might be true but I just don't see any right media in there. I guess there are just different definitions of balanced.
t1_duyteeg	-0.340000	*	Agreed.  He bragged about meeting Putin in 2014 when he thought it would look good for him.  Then denied in 2016 when it would look bad for him.

t1_dujn9w0	0.422800	*	I really doubt Trump would use a platform based on written comments.   He needs simpler messages, like Sesame Street or fox & friends.

t1_dv2chxe	0.000000	*	That depends on what you mean by it. He might mean a specific grade for a specific (military) use.

t1_duqotnr	-0.364600	*	They're just doing what they think is right, like you are. Maybe you're making it hard on yourself by being so bitter about it.

t1_dug9ubr	-0.102700	*	Nah
t1_dum4pks	0.670500	*	Yeah, because in a free US, people had so much to choose from the last time. Maybe someone keeps all reasonable people around the globe from becoming a president. Maybe it's Putin?
t1_dv2ny0t	-0.476700	*	Meh, I'm Canadian, and I don't even vote here because I think elections are a joke, but not as big a joke as having to decide between Hillary and Trump, now that's plain torture.

t1_dv2ny00	0.401900	*	According to them? Someone with a (D) in front of their name. Considering how Trumps base support is still around after he flips on everything he ever said there probably isn't anything else needed.

t1_dv0b3l4	0.202300	*	No, taxes are for giving money to defense contractors and The Wall, not healthcare or nature. Where'd you get that idea, silly?

t1_duiat2v	0.318200	*	Please tell us more edge lord
t1_duhbjwd	-0.846200	*	Same, but the snugness ensures less movement and is why I prefer.  I've had my dick slip out of the boxer fly and hit the denim... ugh.
t1_dufpdpy	-0.401900	*	Republican-bashing on a news story about a plane crash in the middle east.  Never change, reddit.

t1_duuizav	-0.273200	*	There'd probably be some kind of commentary about how the UK is arrogant (not the UK individuals involved, but the country) and diplomatic repercussions.    That's what we're seeing here.

t1_dunp4w4	-0.526700	*	I think if you grew up the way he did, you might find all of your options to be stupid.
t1_duqbxz6	-0.421500	*	The problem is that SC justices dont like overturning recent precedent, even if they personally disagree with it.
t1_dv38bjw	0.585100	*	Yeah, well you're full of shill is better. Maybe you just weren't creative enough.
t1_dubqusc	0.401900	*	So why did you bring up labor cost then? Interesting attempt to dodge the issue.
t1_duv8k5p	0.000000	*	Ooo yah maybe
t1_duq7w3o	0.000000	*	Because it can only be one or the other. 
t1_duzea8q	0.585900	*	Almost all of what you mentioned was a PPP. The railroads for example often got land through imminent domain, were handed government contracts like the mail to help pay for it, etc.
t1_durg4s2	0.000000	*	1 mass shooting per day, give me a break. You're drinking too much mainstream media koolade there bud.
t1_duslt80	-0.440400	*	Wanting border security is wrong? That makes no sense. Canada was all pro immigration till people started trying to go over there and they completely changed their tune. 
t1_dupnvzk	0.542300	*	So you're basically calling for banning or making nearly all of the 350M guns in America illegal. Yeah good luck with making 100 Million Americans Felons.
t1_durs3eb	-0.340000	*	Bernie never said he wanted to take guns away from citizens, in fact he said gun laws should be decided by each state.
t1_dusx5bc	0.319700	*	You just emphasized my point, you are clearly to dense to understand a joke. I am so sorry you were offended.   
t1_duq1auy	0.498000	*	haha, our group had their drinks without any confrontation. The only confrontation we had as with a beggar who was detained and tossed into a military truck with a bunch of soldiers. 
t1_dura6bn	-0.077200	*	How long since you've last played? Gold inflation since WoD has been insane.
t1_duxttpx	0.000000	*	This isn't redditski
t1_dv39n58	0.853200	*	Yeah, but better education doesnt mean shit if the educated don't participate in democracy. 
t1_duhk611	0.000000	*	Tipos are hilareous.
t1_dubvayi	0.658800	*	The great thing about Ireland is that it is self sustaining in that regard. It produces its own alcohol!
t1_duco730	-0.391900	*	You gotta be a special kind of stupid to actually fall for that shit. Not YOU, but anyone.
t1_dv4vys0	0.735100	*	Saved the company 2 million dollars and probably saved the company from losing a billion dollar contract. Refused to promote me. Switched departments and was promoted immediately. 
t1_dv29we4	0.696900	*	If the US had more than two parties, this may be true.
t1_dum4w57	-0.361200	*	Both ideas are shit. Our only way to change country is to create civil society that do not rely on personalities.
t1_dukjvf2	-0.025800	*	Well then keep on fighting the good fight, my man.
t1_duhlwwh	0.226300	*	It seems like if Trump wasnt being affected he wouldnt be ranting about being investigated every other day
t1_dus7to9	-0.709600	*	Also they still have amnesties every now and then for people who have been holding on to their guns but have changed their minds, or for people who discover new illegal guns (e.g. inheritance). 
t1_dv3g3k1	-0.250000	*	Journalism has given way to the three p's....public relations, promotions, and propaganda.  That's a fact.
t1_due8878	0.764400	*	Wow, it's like I've seen this comment somewhere else!
t1_dv0xo5v	0.526700	*	haha, the guy's username is a string of 11 random numbers that was created 5 days ago. Also, hyperbole always weakens your argument, friend.
t1_dun6rr7	-0.952400	*	You're absolutely right getting rid of guns has not reduced the amount of violent crime. What changing the weapon has done however is made it more difficult for those loons to kill loads of people.
t1_dua6t4s	0.202300	*	oh so only 14, must be fine then, nothing to see here.
t1_dv3htj4	-0.273200	*	Spoiler alert: they don't plan on going back into prison when they get out.
t1_dugfsun	0.000000	*	Bielefeld
t1_dujwy5z	0.177900	*	I went to Russian site talking about gay rights in some news article, and every single comment was super homophobic and hateful. It was very eye-opening
t1_duqijhz	0.476700	*	Trump is also appointing unqualified conservative hack judges at an alarming rate. Judges serve for life. He may also be able to stuff the Supreme Court before he leaves office.
t1_dv2arrq	0.476700	*	We weren't the first, and we won't be the last.  To quote a wise man: Ob-la-di, Ob-la-da, Life goes on
t1_duzej6n	0.458800	*	I think strippers in Portland have a union, which is neat. 
t1_duzv4vc	0.612400	*	Just because the majority do one thing isn't a reason to not to remind people of the shit minority out there.
t1_dufmjoa	0.421500	*	Obviously the man feels the need to fuel a grudge, the idea that this is the United States fault unironically is ludicrous at best.
t1_duog03e	0.000000	*	Fucking 1984 nightmare. 
t1_duw4dan	0.077200	*	Control your trade with china like we are.  It's half the reason I voted trump, the other half is his middle east policy to stop the jews from conquering the place. 
t1_duv0c0k	0.361200	*	He looks like a greased Willem Dafoe 
t1_duk0pwh	0.296000	*	I can't tell whether this is a joke
t1_dujpgn7	0.000000	*	if that were the case then I forgot and Im still waiting : P
t1_dusltg3	0.421500	*	Yes, he does mean that. Hes that silly.
t1_dupgoei	-0.340000	*	Yeah WWI was 100% Germany... come on, you really think you can boil down all the factors that led to two world wars into Germany?
t1_duz4uv9	-0.226300	*	And they need to be stopped.
t1_dv0uy0o	0.000000	*	Why does everyone keep suggesting America or Canada for the Boers instead of the Netherlands? Isnt Afrikaans basically Dutch?
t1_duynewf	0.599400	*	It's like vouyers all agreeing that we need fewer privacy laws.
t1_duorlmt	-0.402300	*	Don't worry, I laughed (:
t1_dv2s993	0.012900	*	Same up in Canada. Unfortunately strategic voting is a very valid way to vote in this system. Even Trudeau promised to change it if elected, but we all know how that turned out..
t1_dv32j36	0.000000	*	[No, it's Bender](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ig2qZEiNv8)
t1_dv0fb0d	0.000000	*	Which are just middle eastern hillbillies if you think about it 
t1_durwerx	0.000000	*	Never again ?
t1_dv02nab	0.419900	*	I guess we agree on all points! 
t1_dut270o	0.585900	*	Wow, is there anyway I can learn more about this?
t1_duqkp4e	0.077200	*	People see what they want to see
t1_duzxx7q	0.776700	*	To be fair, if you can legally get in NK you will likely have an armed escort to make sure you don't do anything stupid. 
t1_dujcmdl	0.000000	*	I am the Senate!
t1_dunvhbb	-0.585900	*	>appeal to emotion and not an appeal to logic  Not unlike gun advocates.  There needs to be a radical reduction in gun availability.
t1_dunvga4	-0.296000	*	No. He was explicitly *making a claim* that California would rank high in state corruption (which is not true) and then gave an example which is not relevant. (See more context below)
t1_ducmtwb	0.521300	*	Yeah, protection. Lets not forget that for quite some time the U.S. defense plan for a Sovjet invasion of Germany had been: let them advance to the Rhine, then nuke Germany.
t1_dumr5t7	0.000000	*	The Basque have an issue to raise with you...
t1_duq7emk	0.000000	*	We dem boyz
t1_duqqplf	0.318200	*	If those weed dealers had information to take down the entire cartel, I'm sure they'd get reduced time
t1_dursiwa	0.440400	*	Or we can sequester it in useful structures made of wood.
t1_duodxnw	0.000000	*	Religions, as a mechanism of social control, have probably been around since humans started grunting at each other.  
t1_dugpyb0	-0.476700	*	And it does a terrible job of that. It's flawed
t1_due8i24	-0.421500	*	Yes, actually, because Assange hasn't spent the last few years in a British prison, he's been hiding in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London.
t1_dupezbn	0.000000	*	My point is that they have plenty of money period and just lie. 
t1_dulmvb7	-0.153100	*	No, they're Tajiks with Uzbek and Kyrgyz minorities. They speak Farsi but aren't Persian.
t1_duntvse	0.000000	*	here in BC it's salmon all the way. 
t1_duoq11i	0.357800	*	So we should just hand over the weapons we *do* have without a fight? 
t1_due9fl6	0.076200	*	it's spelled Nha Trang not Nah Trang
t1_dudv3wh	-0.955900	*	>This idea that US manufacturers are noncompetitive is akin to blaming rape victims for not being able to fight off a literal army raping and pillaging their lands;   No... it's not U0001f614
t1_dui9fa2	-0.752200	*	I'd say the impact is less on a poor person because if all they made was $100 they only lost $15. Whereas if they made 1 million they lost $150k. That's quite an impact
t1_dv0wpa9	0.000000	*	He's also the leader of a radical splinter group, he doesn't exactly speak for the government when he says that.
t1_dv36d6z	0.718400	*	Oddly enough, Im usually the one to call out others for mixing up nominal and effective rates. Will look into, thanks. 
t1_dunod5w	0.000000	*	wait, north korea has a nationwide intranet?? 
t1_dubtaq7	0.340000	*	Play fantasy land in your own time.  The dude still has a penis.  
t1_duppvku	0.273200	*	Well not everyone. Which meme does this refer to?
t1_dugm2za	-0.807400	*	These circumcision posts always make want to murder half of the people. At the very least beat them bloody.
t1_dv4t079	0.510600	*	I thought I'd never see the day when America was free of the insidious clutches of *Big Peanut.*
t1_duj33ti	0.035600	*	Falls to pieces - except that is exactly what activists in Australia are now pushing for, as well as elsewhere (ie: Denmark and Sweden).  Edit: not sure why a statement of fact is being down-voted.
t1_duns0dp	0.000000	*	You're a fucking nut
t1_duxwivv	-0.025800	*	So Turkmenistan found a leader crazier than their old Turkmenbashi guy?
t1_duwavnn	0.000000	*	> I don't do politics  Aren't you guys required to vote?
t1_duhkmpn	0.757900	*	Because people are too comfortable with their own little cubicles. And that's pretty much exactly how the government wants us. 
t1_duoazxb	0.000000	*	If it's supposed to represent Joan of Arc, that character and historical figure was white.
t1_dv1w4qy	0.308900	*	Came for cassus belli reference, got EUIV too.  Did not disappoint.
t1_durhrsq	0.492700	*	Neutrality was very profitable for the swiss. 
t1_duzvcvt	0.000000	*	You're honestly arguing that walmart will end all mass shootings by this?
t1_duzzqze	0.458800	*	> But I'm starting to come to the opinion that human beings are hardwired to be tribal  Welcome to Evolutionary psychology 101 
t1_dubzxvu	0.700300	*	And the Chrome clone thing is done far better by Opera & Vivaldi. IMO Vivaldi is also a better Firefox that modern Firefox.
t1_dua6uyk	-0.440400	*	I'd rather have knife attacks on a fairly regular basis then shootings on a fairly regular basis 
t1_dua6uyd	0.226300	*	Thats exactly what I expect him to do. When the students need him the most. I guess it would cost too much to have someone whos actually trained and prepared for that.
t1_duqnw0w	-0.585900	*	That's the point though, he gets the worst charges dropped in exchange for giving more incriminating info on others
t1_dusfkt1	-0.296000	*	People would stop buying as many avocados....
t1_duyxt0u	0.361200	*	Like email, just because you delete your account it doesn't mean you erase the data on the server. Only the Twitter admin can do that.
t1_duon6oq	0.000000	*	Tom Cruise also didn't represent *The Last Samurai*. Rather, the last Samurai were Lord Moritsugu Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) and his people's resistance to Emperor Meiji's industrialization of Japan. 
t1_dupplr5	0.000000	*	why don't we just do what texas does and just break the roads up because we can't afford to fix them anymore?

t1_dur7m2q	-0.458800	*	Do you feel attacked?
t1_dupo4jn	0.510600	*	Congrats. Doens't make the US win a war though. Or GDP relevant to Germany.
t1_dursaw0	-0.735100	*	We always use humanitarian causes to justify our wars. Its a tired beatdown excuse
t1_duya11t	0.000000	*	How is what I described an unchecked right wing when their power depends entirely on the left?
t1_dugtxxo	0.000000	*	But voters arent majority republican identified.  Most voters if asked to identify affiliation was independent. 
t1_dui97jm	-0.308900	*	Something something fiscal responsibility.  Throwing more money at government won't help much if it isn't used sensibly. 
t1_dv5n5w7	0.340000	*	Because theyre cheap. A Toyota truck is far more reliable than a ford or Chevy truck and actually holds its value.   
t1_duozepa	0.000000	*	Are you... snitching?!
t1_dussriv	0.361200	*	Like 80%+ of Democrats currently in office would be considered Classic Conservatives or center center politicians in the majority (if not all) of the civilized world.
t1_duhql76	-0.301300	*	He didn't say he hated Texas or the people in it. He just said there are  stupid people there, which is true. There are stupid people everywhere. Moving somewhere else wouldn't solve that.
t1_duqpj8e	0.000000	*	What people don't realize is that there is another puppet sitting in as vice president. I think if a vote came to remove him from office, the republicans wouldn't mind having Pence take his place. 
t1_duuqbeh	0.670500	*	Looking at that picture, I'm pretty sure that the Wasp class are basically the same as most of those other carriers, and the real CVs are a whole other level.
t1_dv075j7	-0.677100	*	So if I have no specific intended purpose, I can be arrested?

t1_dv2oht7	0.421500	*	Kids lol, I'm nearly 40.
t1_duzxsou	-0.599400	*	Didnt millions die because of that famine (cant remember the name)
t1_dv2f0jc	0.061300	*	Yeah, not at all a fan of the steel tariffs on peer countries. Having said that, there's nothing that says there won't be steel subsidies in addition to these tariffs. 
t1_dugc1so	0.000000	*	I see you've unlocked the mystical secrets of nationalism.
t1_dv5gzx8	-0.458800	*	I doubt it, considering how many people have no sympathy for North Korea and don't see it as a victim of bullying simply doing its best to survive.
t1_duee3vi	-0.531800	*	Why would a Russian resort not be lovely? Are Russians now considered on par with Nazis? I really dont understand this 
t1_duzzcwb	0.361200	*	Anyone who supports this should have their head examined.
t1_dv009ts	0.840200	*	yeah, this entire thread reads to me like a stormfront thread lol. I always thought reddit was full of lilly SJW warriors, and then you see a thread like this one
t1_ducs4b2	0.657100	*	Posting on Twitter is Russian involvement? I thought this was focused on a DNC hack not FEC violations.
t1_duq6bfg	-0.059000	*	I dont appreciate your tone sir. this mentality would be fine for anyone else. but this was his job. This is the exact reason he was there. He got paid for this, and he did nothing.
t1_dv2e9d7	-0.812600	*	Ah, reminds me of when Obama was a Muslim commie atheist fascist that wants to take all your guns.  Remember that bullshit? Those were the days...
t1_dugu97j	0.000000	*	Can confirm. I did this (not that it mattered, I live in California).

t1_dui9z63	0.901700	*	Of course, everyone should have a part in solving social issues. However, getting funding for solving these issues is definitely a major roadblock, so the wealthy tend to make that process easier.
t1_duf5zqf	0.000000	*	At this point you could pop it in a Tupperware and send it first class to her office and not be going quite far enough.
t1_dv60pzq	-0.401900	*	Only after purchasing a shocking amount of cocaine from them, that is.
t1_dv27d4i	0.000000	*	We used a sledgehammer, they used nanobots.  
t1_duvvukm	-0.168500	*	To be fair the UK has similar classes of ship and do not consider them aircraft carriers. So does Japan IIRC.  They just don't have the ability to sustain long range operations alone.
t1_dupu8my	0.361200	*	John Daley would like a word with you. 
t1_duai4qa	0.153100	*	probably worse  Yeah you sound like you're not just making it up.

t1_duoyaqa	0.000000	*	Most under-rated comment on this post.

t1_dujcoyu	0.000000	*	Then your thinking is backward. One of them acts as a female, therefore this is the opposite of manliness.
t1_dulf5od	0.812600	*	Also, literally 100% of his sex partners are people who will agree to have sex with condomless men.  Good luck with the roulette.

t1_duul8hj	-0.834300	*	It's not the truth of it that's killing them, and me, and others. It's that we're in the tiny minority willing to accept it, and that adds a layer of hopelessness to it that can't really be overcome.

t1_duk9i1n	-0.102700	*	>  I dont believe they meddled and then quickly say they could have...  Both of which are the typical, vague politi-speak used by politicians universally.

t1_duzgmz1	0.475400	*	I wouldn't say that is entirely true, so many technological and medical advances have come directly from the US Military because their budget is so large. 
t1_duji1jj	0.051600	*	Didn't know he was a Jew until your comment, seems your the one who wanted to highlight that fact no the owner of the comment.

t1_dugpgru	-0.431000	*	Bernie lost at the ballot box. The DNC effected that but it wasnt solely them just like trump wasnt solely the result of Russia.   The left rejected him for Hillary.

t1_dugc4m2	-0.250000	*	Warning shots first? First salvo sprays water all over near horizon, meaning they shot in wide line across. When boat doesn't turn back, second time it goes in straight line, cutting boat in half.
t1_dutjqgb	0.458800	*	Not really. The US government already used a bogus vaccine program to gather intelligence to help find bin Laden in Afghanistan. As a result a lot of people there distrust vaccines now. 
t1_duq2trv	0.581900	*	Well said. So very well said. 
t1_dugp3ny	0.510600	*	Pretty sure he meant the Republican party.His point is valid as far as I'm concerned. There is no comparison

t1_dugbln1	-0.226300	*	It's an archaic term used primarily to describe post-ww2 political alignment.  Israel is not exactly developed country either. It's alright, like Lebanon before Lebanon got fucked.

t1_duybta3	-0.421500	*	Russia has land, but Putin is a very small man.  Russia should stop letting itself be dictated to by such a tiny person.

t1_duofgnt	0.510600	*	I was plenty old enough. And old enough to remember that it was the working class that always made fun of the Soviets and the Eastern Bloc by saying  May I see your papers, comrade?
t1_dv261db	0.689200	*	Ok! Thanks for the response!
t1_dusydl9	-0.077200	*	I mean, the GOP has bent over backwards to accommodate Trump. And that's in a democracy with 2 parties.   And how have those people been punished? By being given cabinet positions.

t1_duzz0kj	0.000000	*	Why is it that everything is evidence of a white genocide?
t1_dudmumh	-0.851900	*	That's not it at all. What killed nuclear was public paranoia after Chernobyl. Has absolutely nothing to do with storing nucler waste as that was never a major public health issue.

t1_duj9t03	-0.051600	*	Interesting and logical point, I don't know why people just downvote. Frustrates me when people just downvote rather than actually replying with something.

t1_dugkos1	0.128000	*	I agree that he's mostly talking out his ass, however waving it off as inconsequential downplays the importance of having such a deeply flawed leader, and provides cover for further inane ramblings.
t1_dul6xtp	0.757900	*	Perhaps you can get your lovely president to help develop the first time machine, and send yourself to the 40's. That way your way of thinking will match the era.

t1_dunq5vi	-0.556300	*	Really, no political model is inherently evil. It's just that humans can easily be corrupted and some systems allow more leeway for that.
t1_dugp3wr	0.735100	*	Just sounded like you casually assumed everyone was loaded and had personal staff haha it isn't a big deal
t1_duaqsoz	0.572900	*	Yeah, and now much more money is being paid to private collectors who are orders of magnitude less efficient than IRS agents.

t1_dv24wl2	0.025800	*	Youre getting downvoted by americans who think Trudeau is a good PM. Ask any canadian and they will point out how useless he is. 
t1_dusz74p	0.226300	*	Its ironic that you are giving your opinion in this discussion even though you are against democracy, which is based on listening to other's opinions and discussing them.

t1_duainrx	-0.340000	*	So your answer is that if you're gay your political speech is stifled. 
t1_dv2zc9i	-0.765000	*	Jeez dude, the point is that since it would be impractical to do that, and it would make a horrible projectile (picture throwing a deflated balloon at someone), that the story is probably fake.

t1_dv0wa19	0.000000	*	For a mandate to work, you need an enforcement mechanism. I believe it's left up to the states in the US because the states can use schools as the enforcement tool.

t1_duhqpgc	-0.340000	*	Loss of life caused by nukes for the expense of one man? I doubt it, it'd still be a fucking enormous deal, but I don't think it's a big enough deal to start throwing nukes around...

t1_dushqrb	0.226300	*	Lets be real its impossible to defend any of the sides involved in the conflict. At best you want the conflict to end as soon as possible because thats is the only way to limit the body count.

t1_duo7en8	0.318200	*	Sure. But becoming older makes you more experienced.  80%+ off Russians have access to Internet and to 'free' media. Your point was that access to the Internet makes people rallying against Putin.

t1_dv2qdtj	-0.016400	*	Yeah, I don't really like Trudeau either, but I don't cringe every time he speaks (or tweets).

t1_dv04xgz	0.510600	*	Lol how in the world can you possibly defend that claim? That's ridiculous. I'd genuinely like to hear your defense on that one. 
t1_dukxo34	0.510600	*	Yeah, cause that went well everytime it happened
t1_duyw9vb	-0.340000	*	Youre right, they shouldnt. But unfortunately, how things should be and how they actually are often dont match up.
t1_durnfeh	0.750600	*	A paradigm shift in nutrition could stop climate change in its tracks.  Good luck convincing people to not use or eat animal products for at least 25 years though.
t1_dujokzj	0.025800	*	To add to his point a lot of the defense budget goes to paychecks and Military programs. In China it's far cheaper to hire soldiers and to feed them. I believe it costs 200b to pay our soldiers?
t1_dufvjww	0.170500	*	Omfg stop trying to sound smart talkin bout crystals LOL. The drug is aleve and tummy pills not some fucking super complex drug for aids or chemo.  Slow your roll.

t1_duq6y9u	0.076200	*	It's different when the account is brand new and all they comment on are Trump/Russia related threads. These trolls aren't all that hard to spot if you know what to look for
t1_dut8i3z	0.000000	*	But this thread is about talks with the US...
t1_duz84e1	-0.718400	*	Send Comey to get him, he isn't doing anything, and i bet he's done some crazy spy shit in his career. 
t1_dumfrk2	0.457400	*	When I support things it's because Im educated, when other people do though it must be because they're brainwashed!
t1_dv4pb0a	0.401900	*	As much as i appreciate bashing a buffoon, I was looking for any sort of explanation so that I might know what to expect from the apologists out there

t1_dugppqu	0.000000	*	46% percent of the vote, less than 20% of the country. I'm not even making that up.   
t1_dut5mhn	-0.836000	*	That was my cynicism speaking, I didnt know for sure but I just made up that scenario to state my hopelessness. Sure I can follow the tips but Id still wear the hopeless face all the same.

t1_dv0nzbe	0.361200	*	Thank you. 
t1_dv2omoq	-0.401900	*	Limited liability 
t1_dux0u27	0.318200	*	The DA had over a decade, and they wouldn't have needed the extra funds in the first place if they had listened to the original directives from the national government.
t1_duxjdcm	0.831600	*	That's definitely true but employing an army of trolls to influence the neckbeards on Reddit seems like high effort/low return prospect. 
t1_duzywj8	0.812600	*	I heard they have free healthcare so everything else they do must be awesome right....
t1_dud3j6h	-0.612400	*	No but you might want to look why a foreign power that hates you really seems to push something in your country
t1_dv2w61o	0.051600	*	In my defense the only reason I didn't vote was because I spent pretty much all of election day in the ER, I still feel real bad about it though.
t1_dv0r7dd	0.077200	*	Man being a student here sucks right now. I think where I a lucky is that my job will be found almost anywhere in the world, so I have an option of leavjng the country if I have to money.
t1_dugr15e	0.000000	*	President is a full time job.  If Trump can't handle that, he shouldn't have run for the position.
t1_dupo55u	0.000000	*	What?
t1_dun8rgj	0.000000	*	Plenty of young people do too. There are idiots in every generation, just once you're pushing above 60 your mind will start to dim, I guess, putting them at the same level as 20 year olds.

t1_durcdcj	0.296000	*	That's the joke son.
t1_dujd464	-0.476700	*	I mean. Kind of. Pedophiles are in the minority and we don't consult them. We assume, because they're the minority, that they're wrong.

t1_dukotx4	0.000000	*	How should I know?
t1_dufeflb	-0.838100	*	So then why are you complaining if other countries are doing it to you? As you said, geopolitics is real. Just suck it up and move on realising that this shit will always happen.

t1_dus39fm	0.177900	*	Lmao, parts of the dossier being unverified are not the same thing as it being fraudulent. Can you name for me a single allegation made in the dossier that has actually been disproved?

t1_dui7buc	-0.585900	*	And I'm saying what he wants is stupid.  If he thinks he isn't taxed enough, he can just pay more and quit speaking for everyone else.
t1_dupjp73	0.357400	*	To be honest, I'm more afraid of those strawmen you're building invading our country than Russia. Where would we be if it weren't for 'whataboutists' like you to tear them down!

t1_dv2wdr6	0.631000	*	Corporate tax is an inefficient way to tax the wealthy because the costs of the taxes are not concentrated on the wealthy but are born by workers and consumers as well. 
t1_dup9tan	-0.200300	*	Thats only cause they tried going in too early after the scouts lied and god said, NOPE!

t1_dupgtco	-0.421500	*	That I couldn't tell you, but I doubt it's many. They want more money, not more work.

t1_duis645	-0.553500	*	> circumcision, which is meant to be an everyday occurrence, and which despite your silly protestations has zero societal harm   You post proves otherwise.   
t1_dugy8zf	0.668100	*	Best friend is a staunch supporter. He has just recently realized how awful he is. He still supports Trump, because he doesn't want to look dumb.
t1_duyk1z0	-0.128000	*	Yeah, the bot actually included FOX in an earlier posting I saw.   So I don't think the bot is the problem. I think that the media is.
t1_duro8e3	0.659700	*	The point is you find someone who can fix it and support them in doing it.   Having an opinion is not equal to having the answer, but you do have the power to help. 
t1_duejeme	-0.580300	*	How does the data show that?  If he had no part of it why would he try to stop Comey from investigating it?

t1_duhwc1p	0.246200	*	Your answer is spot on. We have nothing left to sell any more except services. And dont forget the huge role the Chinese are having in the new Nuclear power stations being proposed!!

t1_duyu99y	-0.542300	*	Now I'm picturing Trump being turned into a literal ass instead of just being a figurative one 
t1_dv09rl0	-0.564700	*	Creates a lot as well. Nothing you've said is dependent on religion so far but you try and separate the bad from it. Do you see the hypocrisy in that? 
t1_dujoi4t	0.000000	*	I never said who started or didn't start either of the crusades

t1_dur634n	-0.557400	*	Just ARs? They had tanks, recon vehicles, technicals, etc...  They even described all that shit getting blown up, which is why they only had ARs left.
t1_dv1raod	0.659700	*	Which is why Europe decided it would be a good idea to band together into a common market. Their economic leverage is greater than the sum of its parts.
t1_dv354rl	-0.722700	*	That's how it is for registered bots I think, but there's no restriction if you pretend to be a real person. 
t1_dutkrd0	-0.718400	*	Also lost the negative connotation with the spectrum.
t1_dufv0ks	0.273200	*	Yea well that was obviously the Russians sowing divisiveness

t1_duumibf	-0.847800	*	You just brought piss to a shit fight!
t1_dugu4jv	-0.915300	*	Murder is a moral construct, by definition.  The question you want to be asking is: Was killing another human immoral before the first law?  And the answer is...  ...it depends. 
t1_dujf57a	-0.440400	*	I don't think that's actually an example of that fallacy. It's entirely reasonable to suggest that both sides deserve criticism for different things. 
t1_dv00p0c	-0.435700	*	youre not exaggerating, youre completely wrong
t1_duodhzn	0.421500	*	I was specifically referring to the idea that he's a puppet of the Kremlin, but yeah I get your point 
t1_duua1z9	0.000000	*	Maybe so, but I guess we will never know. 
t1_duab1xf	-0.012900	*	Certainly, but there is positive protectionism and there is propaganda protectionism. This is a blow to the latter.  Edit: used wrong word.
t1_dv1i8xe	0.273200	*	Seems like it would be hard to chew.

t1_dupj7hc	0.636900	*	This is the best comment on this thread.
t1_dugvs2t	-0.680800	*	Yeah, because making things illegal always keeps people from getting/doing those things. Just like drugs, murder, and theft.
t1_duustuq	-0.250000	*	Sounds a good way to get into a war with a nuclear power
t1_duaa7m9	-0.570700	*	Oh OK.. I took the bait... Too bad for me.. But what is worrying is that some people actually agree with him... Goosebumps!
t1_duzajh3	0.000000	*	Is is also White-Russia in Greek. 
t1_duwruf9	-0.526700	*	We call them premieres to avoid the confusion. The Prime Minister is the head of the country, while First Ministers (*premiere* ministre, en francais) are the heads of provinces.

t1_dueyczj	0.340000	*	I didn't have to work nearly as hard as I do now in the true private sector.
t1_dud2xnt	-0.821200	*	What a terrible analogy. The USA being evil or not is an opinion, not a factual matter that experts can weigh in on. 
t1_dv0rmff	0.027600	*	Top economists kind of brought that on themselves by pushing neo-liberalism really hard for a really long time.

t1_duh2fji	0.000000	*	Manafort was not on that boat, I don't think even Navalny started that.
t1_duadaj5	0.440400	*	It has far more potential to get people off their asses and actually vote next time. How many Sanders supporters on reddit do you think actually went out and voted for him?
t1_dupix9w	0.273200	*	Germany committed to it multiple times in recent years
t1_dv3qvsi	0.000000	*	Of course he will, pumpkin...of course he will..

t1_duo4rdw	-0.536200	*	So it was just sarcasm, correct? No one actually thinks that he meant that right?
t1_ducxz4y	-0.296000	*	No, not really.
t1_durg88b	0.000000	*	Link or source needed for what definition was used. 
t1_dum9qxf	0.000000	*	The whole point of it is that you can't know the answer to that question.
t1_dv2ab20	0.318200	*	Here is the truth. 
t1_durhbbj	-0.636900	*	Yes no doubt many would call him a piece of shit.  But taking responsibility for our part of the equation is the enlightened thing to do. America is a long way from that sadly.

t1_dujcdsc	-0.557400	*	So you're saying a country doesn't have to take in undocumented illegal immigrants?
t1_dugamjt	0.361200	*	You're the one making it weird. It's my son, of course I care about his reproductive future. And since I have had all these discussions, I have come to view this subject quite a bit differently.

t1_dupyurj	-0.519800	*	Yes, and it's the most useless and annoying cultural trait imaginable.
t1_duyby29	0.700300	*	Yeah, that does work. The communist style might've worked if they hired competent managers, but they mostly used party members and other incompetents
t1_dusdpmk	-0.599400	*	Canada would operate just like the US. They allow massive environmental damage in their own country w the tar sands, and Canadian mining companies are some of the worst abroad. 
t1_duu5fcf	0.685800	*	I imagine because it's water. I suppose that whatever packaging it's in would probably make it a bit nasty after a hundred years, but water stays preserved pretty well.

t1_dud160f	-0.128000	*	This indictment may be a trap set for Trump. He'll admit to stuff because he's unwitting and then they simply have to prove he knew all along (which they likely can already do)

t1_dv0egod	-0.153100	*	There is certainly a link between priest celibacy and the levels of child molesting. Even the Catholic Church starts to admit it and might reconsider their dogma on that point.

t1_dv2g3hk	0.077200	*	This is correct and should be noted by all. The news and /r/southafrica has been sensationalising it in a very different manner. This of course brings out all the lovely racists and trolls.

t1_duqksyv	0.260300	*	That's a minimum, sentences are not concrete. State sentencing is less than .8 that has to be carried through. But even with good behavior, etc. a federal offender has to spend 80% behind bars.

t1_duotm16	0.891000	*	Thats good, thats funny. Good and funny. 
t1_dusxul3	-0.817600	*	Policing involves maintain your order of law. The Cold War and Vietnam were proxy wars for the proliferation of Capitalism (our law) over Communism.

t1_duh0vb5	-0.226300	*	Oh.  Ok. I was wrong.
t1_duqwp5i	0.000000	*	really ? He didnt move with her to The Netherlands. Story might not be as black and white as it is being painted.
t1_duppxyo	0.077200	*	You should add spoilers for the 95% who want to comment without reading the article.

t1_dv45cv8	-0.784500	*	Omg.. they werent opening fire. Did you see them shoot their rifles? Also apparently the footage is taken out of context since these Israelis were under attack themselves before.

t1_dv3aayu	0.000000	*	> they probably need a break before they dive into 4Chan.   Who doesn't?
t1_duaeijn	-0.226300	*	The voters gambled and lost. At some point they need to stop pointing fingers and accept that the government reflects the voters. 
t1_duu2ac9	-0.757900	*	Guess we'll have to live underground and build giant robots to fight the Angels of Death.
t1_dulf9dt	0.648600	*	Well, there was outside influence forcing their hand

t1_dujnqyt	-0.648600	*	No wonder poor Seany lives in a bush now.
t1_duwy9kz	0.557400	*	A ton of energy is used to produce the cement.  Cement and ceramic production accounts for something like 20% of CO2 output, IIRC.  A lot of fuel is used for the extreme temps needed.
t1_dv4t1s7	-0.476700	*	Let's not make Hillary out to be a saint just because Trump is worse.  That's precisely how we got here buddy.

t1_dujcwub	-0.536200	*	Like, do they have to foster a straight man after his wife leaves his domestic abusing ass? Is that a law in Russia?
t1_dv1ae0x	0.000000	*	I would say to complete their current aim they should restructure themselves heavily. 
t1_dv2g4yr	-0.765000	*	We all know that a booming stock market has never ever led to anything bad before. what could possibly be wrong with using the markets as a barometer to the health of your economy..
t1_dutc30v	-0.153100	*	Is it no longer 50k USD per year? That's what it has been at Merchant's Bank for us (using a Chinese account), but I haven't checked it in a week or so.
t1_dumx9r2	-0.197000	*	>I wouldn't call that a straw man. I'd say that claiming facebook ads and internet trolls cost Hillary the election  Yep, more strawman arguments.

t1_duwp3m9	0.648600	*	Well with tax harmonization on the way and the inability of Euro country's to set their own interest rates, I'd say Rockerfeller would have something to say about that old chap.

t1_duzxzmj	-0.316700	*	Lol, in 2011 Canada had a population of 35 million and 25 million of those people were white.   So wtf you talking about arent a majority anymore?

t1_dun3snq	0.273200	*	Well, it is _now_... 
t1_duo93oo	-0.709600	*	No.   VT is not a news organization. They do not practice journalism. They are a hate site.

t1_duajnru	0.510600	*	Refugees are a priority for the whole world. Japan in my eyes did not carry its weight on the world stage. The ethical issues are mainly surrounding their treatment of refugees and immigrants.

t1_dv36222	-0.594800	*	might not be worth the damage they do tho
t1_duntz1y	-0.577000	*	That's what I don't get. Square-cube law means you're wasting a lot of packaging on such a small amount of condiment. Maybe it's so the packets don't rupture as easily
t1_dup9hfo	0.000000	*	> even if you show them research or 100% proof.  You can't logic someone out of a position they didn't logic themselves in to.

t1_dui3yaw	-0.051600	*	So because you and one other person had good fortune, that must mean everyone else is just doing things wrong. Ah.
t1_duriiv7	0.000000	*	Stories of Nazi's throwing babies out of windows comes to mind as a comparison. 
t1_dumdmxk	-0.953500	*	Are you suggesting people should keep having children they can't support to have them live in poverty, suffer worse life opportunities and abuse, and have to deal with higher rates of crime?
t1_dur85e0	0.000000	*	That's a lot of cash

t1_dugs6f7	0.421500	*	Right and the swing states were even closer like 70,000 votes either way. Just goes to show how small a number of voters russia had to manipulate to swing the election
t1_dv4qbt6	-0.542300	*	Where do you live? I wouldnt be able to get my ass anywhere
t1_dud4sg4	0.000000	*	Ya, I think this is what he was already referring to. Fluent being a passable but not necessarily comfortable level in a language
t1_dv1sw9n	-0.609300	*	I was just thinking similar to that - this guy is our alternative to trading EU?! Hes a maniac!!
t1_duv9jip	0.380400	*	I think /u/naanandcurry was talking about two separate things. And saying Most of the trash on this island comes from the large rcountry it is a part of is actually a very meaningful statement.

t1_dv3cqxs	0.778300	*	Heinlein is such a good author... why hang with that miserable dude who made a religion to use people.  Hubbard is also a mediocre writer at best.  A couple good books with hundreds of had ones 
t1_dunjhtr	0.401900	*	Gotta say, that's an interesting point.
t1_dushma7	-0.389900	*	Does that mean raising taxes on US corporations is a tax on the Americans buying their products? A regressive one at that? Should we just drop all corporate taxes?
t1_duppw9s	0.202300	*	Always. Just because we fall short of our ideals doesn't mean we give up on them.

t1_duc9njm	-0.736100	*	But that isn't what happens. No criminal would turn them self in to get vaccinated. You just gets unvaccinated criminals.
t1_dus7oxg	0.128000	*	Interesting. I guess all we're missing is uhh... any actual evidence that proves this narrative. I guess we'll keep waiting.

t1_duskej4	0.242000	*	Yes bc cutting off someone's hands and raping women who don't wear the right clothes is necessary, oh and let's not forget the decapitating the infidels. That last one is super necessary

t1_dug2kyv	-0.301700	*	I couldn't pull back my foreskin until I was 13 years old. Coincidentally that's when I started wanking so I'm not sure if the two are related.

t1_dued37e	0.361200	*	I feel like we need to make a distinction between Russian citizen vacationers and Russian political actors though.  I'd garner most Americans would get along with most Russians.
t1_dugyf0p	-0.700300	*	Thats the only explanation because there was no rational reason why a bankrupt reality star should be president, ever.
t1_duqmf8c	-0.857700	*	right now, he lied to or withheld info from the FBI.  i'm not sure 4 years for lying to a cop is all that minor.  it sort of depends on the other offenses.
t1_dukb5a5	0.810500	*	Now I'm curious, is there a fastest growing phase to trees? are we better off chopping them down after a certain point, as to store that carbon in timber?
t1_duy23n7	-0.680000	*	As an American, we're oppressed.  They took away our machine guns, and now they're after our military guns.  The line must be drawn here, this far no further!
t1_duy20fc	0.771700	*	Trust me I know a few people who get really angery over small things that shouldn't be a big deal. A lot of people certainly take what they have for granted.

t1_dv492us	0.659300	*	Well theoretically with that down speed you'd be able to hit 1.0584TB in a day so obviously you're just not trying hard enough.  Maybe /r/DataHoarder has some ideas for you :)

t1_duz39pq	0.476700	*	They also publicly performed an orgy in a public location.  If my friends and I went to the public library and started having sex, you're saying we shouldn't go to jail?
t1_dv0tijh	-0.226300	*	Well the corrupt leaders in Animal Farm were pigs, and without n his name is Xi Jipig... I mean he banned Winnie the Pooh because of a meme. It doesn't have to have a complicated reason.

t1_dv3stla	0.750600	*	Exactly. If they want to waist state money on a meme that makes me laugh I am perfectly fine with it. It's just the internet. Shits weird here and I wouldn't want it any other way.
t1_duuawl1	0.202300	*	They invested a ton of money into it because they recognized a void developing in the market and predicted a huge rise in demand.  It's economic, not altruistic.

t1_dus1aqv	-0.202300	*	Well it's not a campaign, but if it were I would be illegal whether they disclosed it or not. That's why people launder their money through charitable foundations and SuperPACs.
t1_dujap3e	-0.542300	*	Fuck, that is absolutely disgraceful.
t1_dv2pxlz	0.440400	*	If only there was some way to trade this steel freely.

t1_duyu6is	0.115400	*	People with autism do tend to jump between subjects but Trump can't even finish a single sentence. I don't think it's the right comparison.

t1_dugju1r	0.153100	*	Yeah well I guess it's all my fault then. 
t1_dv3djpv	-0.493900	*	Thats true. As bad as it may be to spend the rest of ones life under crippling medical debt, in the US we *do* have the option of not dying from treatable diseases and injuries.

t1_duygkw0	-0.372200	*	Have they ever done that kind of shit in a mosque? Would reddit support them if they did?
