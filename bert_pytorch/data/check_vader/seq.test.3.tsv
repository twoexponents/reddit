t1_dur5pfy	0.000000	*	IIRC, all flus are antibiotic resistant.   
t1_dur4z7g	0.000000	*	In practical level it might not be foreign money. Was it Gucci HQ from Italy directly or Gucci USA (or whatever their USA subsidiary is) on orders from HQ? Or even Gucci USA on their own initiative.
t1_dv571km	0.401900	*	Check out North Korea's military Promo's. They are hilarious. One has an 80s advert tier SFX rendition of North Korean missiles blowing up a US aircraft carrier. 
t1_durxov0	0.371600	*	It may, indeed, be a great gin, but maybe you shouldn't drink and type.
t1_duvexxv	-0.510600	*	No he's not. It was just a joke about how he could *technically* be elected under specific circumstances.  This is just a dumb clickbait title.
t1_dumwtyk	-0.492700	*	That sounds really stupid. In Van Buren's defense, however, he didn't grow up speaking English.  Edit: As his name would suggest, he grew up speaking Dutch. Look it up.
t1_dv0q8cb	0.965200	*	Watch Trump go on a world tour promoting Neonicotinoids.  Look at these very beautiful Neonicotinoids. You love em I love em, Bees love em.
t1_duq44hs	0.587500	*	Because that it didn't happen. Crazy huh, that the FBI doesn't investigate conspiracy theories from 4chan.

t1_dv0wl71	0.000000	*	? Monsanto doesn't have anything to do with neonics. The only thing they use them for is seed treatments and they outsource that to some other company because they don't make them. 
t1_duvu6v6	0.250000	*	The irony of throwing a political opposition supporter in jail because they suggest the government might be corrupt. It's getting silly now.

t1_dup1jph	-0.726900	*	The right has all the money, the left is left to eat scraps. No wonder the revolution will be violent.

t1_dujw6jo	0.796400	*	that gave me a good chuckle, thank you
t1_dulhvu3	0.215800	*	Help them in their country. Don't invite them to yours. UK and USA top spending on aid. The money goes further and there are no issues with mass migration. Germany should change their approach. 
t1_dut90d2	0.075900	*	Chinas system of goverment doesn't work like the west. Xi runs everything via the communist party, all this is but a formality. If he wants this it will pass

t1_dus2erg	0.612400	*	That's all the result of the actions of a single party.   The Republican memo was unprecedented as have been many other recent GOP attempts to subvert truth, the rule of law, and US institutions.
t1_duzt0g0	-0.603600	*	I would be surprised if it isn't true. I know of horrible things happening to Russians in Australia that can't be divulged publicly because of ongoing investigations. The women need protection, asap.

t1_dv0nu4o	-0.296000	*	It's likely that GB wouldn't be able to export anything grown using these pesticides to the EU so maybe that will cause them to stop?

t1_duqgaek	0.340000	*	Downvotes because the Russians are definitely *not* bad at doping.   They pretty much wrote the fucking book on doping. They got away with state sponsored doping for decades.

t1_dubln18	0.899800	*	There are a lot of very smart people using Twitter. Much more than Reddit. Some of the smartest and most influential people with important things to say use it daily. I follow scientists, mostly. 
t1_dv2gq19	-0.177900	*	Youre a special kind of stupid.  Did you even read the article?
t1_dui57hu	-0.451900	*	Actually this may be exactly what's needed to push projects with new and unproven tech that may have a big payoff.  I'm not sure what the downside of this kind of competition could be.

t1_dulf1n7	0.000000	*	When I was going to school in Spain,  15 years ago, Catholic religion was a subject where they only talked about about catholicism.  I opted out, but there weren't many people that did. 
t1_dupav8g	-0.318200	*	This is clap trap, you're leaving out far too much information to come to that conclusion and you are drawing conclusions that are too broad anyway.

t1_duymnc1	-0.843900	*	Worse. They might find themselves in a crisis of succession that could tear the country apart. It's highly ironic given their party's obsessive focus on national unity.
t1_duija7t	-0.855500	*	Yup, and while we learn to be buddy-buddy with NK, they continue to torture their own civilians to the brink of starvation and suicide.  It's a win-win, apparently.
t1_dujj3ym	-0.204000	*	The collusion he is denying is in regards to them meddling with the election.   So yes, he did deny it. 
t1_durbkbe	-0.680800	*	It was a scam all along. No refugee would ever want to resettle in Cambodia of all places.
t1_dux5now	-0.835600	*	no no, anything lower then euro 4 is already banned from almost all city centers. this would bann everything under euro 6 from city centers, entire citys and even small towns!
t1_duaimhl	0.000000	*	I wonder if it could be applied really fast.  Maybe someone could design spraypaint can nozzles that spray in the shape of Navalny so it's just a quick spray-and-run.

t1_duz3cs6	0.381800	*	The best airport I've ever seen is Toronto, the worst is Havanah. The US literally has airports like a third world country.

t1_dunld94	0.739100	*	Not sure if you noticed but tuna sushi is popular all over the world by people of all races, not just the Japanese. The obstacle is to convince a majority that a certain food must not be consumed.

t1_dunaahl	-0.502800	*	Isn't it funny that when you use the term White Power it's racism, but when someone says Black Power it's about 'liberation'?
t1_dv0bfq1	0.718100	*	Did you expect otherwise? People are keen on superficial equal treatment if it means keeping ill-earned wealth and property and not having to pay reparations.
t1_dun4vql	-0.296000	*	No one knows I'm a dog? I know you tried to use Google translate though. The word you're looking for is cyka.

t1_dulcsz0	0.296000	*	Yeah, I mean how cheap can somebody be? Maybe it's kleptomania, since he did it a few times.
t1_dv4fdyl	0.771700	*	Sure there is.  The Russians want him and the US want him.  Based on declarations by the judge, the US will probably win.

t1_dv4v4zp	-0.735100	*	It was Google's fault in the first place.  Discrimination to fix a fuck up is still discrimination.

t1_dv1zmd9	-0.904200	*	Agreed, how can you send someone to war at 18 but not allow them to own a gun or drink....   You aren't old enough to own this gun, but you are old enough to shoot it at another human sober. 
t1_dv44z6f	-0.027600	*	As sad as it is you get used to having rocks and molotovs thrown at you when you're in Magav.  So yes.

t1_dubz31k	-0.244400	*	> People have been saying it for years, the next war won't be fought with guns, it will be fought with keyboards.  So what's with all the domestic shootings then - L literacy rates?
t1_dv4gl5g	0.000000	*	We realise this. But still
t1_duywf68	-0.726900	*	This isn't Islam, this is a totalitarian regime using religion as an excuse to exert power over women. The specific religion being abused is not particularly relevant.

t1_dusmzik	-0.128000	*	The outright similarities in the titles are alarming. How much effort would it take to not give the appearance of plagiarism?
t1_dursqu7	0.128000	*	There are sanctions in place on the DPRK, enforcing those sanctions is legal.  Who is going to do anything about it? The USN has the second largest air force in the world after the USAF.
t1_dupodyj	0.361200	*	Thank you so much for speaking sense, when I saw this headline I almost did a spit take.  Basic economic and financial knowledge apparently doesn't exist on Reddit.
t1_duozimj	0.599400	*	The same way the US does almost anything it wants. Deep pockets and a huge, nuclear capable military.   Who is going to stand up to either?
t1_duozimz	-0.726400	*	i highly doubt 45 even has one..  the fact that he needed a note to tell him to sympathize to a group of grieving people says it all..
t1_dusrbpb	0.000000	*	here's the thing: you can be anti-Hitler and _also_ anti-Stalin. in fact, back in the day, before it got bumraped by an orange clown, this was kind of America's USP.

t1_duue3pj	0.782300	*	Pretty sure that these people already have autism, so it probably increased a while ago.
t1_dudbamb	0.476700	*	Nobody actually cares about these Russians. Who they were working with/for in the US is all that matters. Once that info comes out, it's goodnight current government. 
t1_dui4vj1	0.297500	*	It is almost like socialism isn't working out for much of Europe.  Who'd have thought?
t1_dua4lpl	-0.823300	*	Everyone does have fists. People still get punched in high school. What do you think would happen if every high schooler had a gun? Probably fewer shooting sprees, but a LOT more random murders.

t1_dujbe6j	0.444500	*	The video is satire/parody, it's not serious. And the gay thing is just a small part of it, and not the main focus, as the title clearly implies.
t1_dun8mns	0.681400	*	Janitors will receive specops training so they will take care of the Mexican standoff with minimal casualties. Don't worry.

t1_duetvxc	0.490300	*	Lol yep. I got banned for asking a question that wasn't even very critical of Trump.
t1_dupngd4	0.766200	*	It's always fun to expand a comment sitting at -24 votes only to find that it's not a troll or something like that, but simply someone with an unpopular opinion.  It's not an I disagree button!
t1_dut7bxe	0.000000	*	I get the Tsar is Putin and Emperor is Xi but who is the Sultan?

t1_dv2klhk	0.273200	*	Oh no, he wants us to be isolated. Everyone is worried about Russia, except him. He wants us to feel like Russia is our only true Ally, then we become like Iran in the 70s and 80s
t1_dujirk3	-0.296000	*	I believe you missed r/conspiracy by a bit.
t1_dudq0q3	-0.128000	*	I live in Chicago and saw it with an overwhelmingly black audience and had the same experience.  Don't tell Joe Rogan.  He's very sensitive about this sort of thing.
t1_dufswf2	0.190100	*	I agree, but still does not change the fact that the Deripaska is a dirtbag but then so is Nuland.

t1_dujspxs	0.587600	*	Not Australian but I'm guessing this like a Alberta-restofCanada/Catalonia-restofSpain sort of beef in that you feel more tax revenue is going out than coming in?  
t1_dudpnjw	-0.102700	*	Any time you see a like button for Facebook, twitter or others, they know you've visited the website it was on.   Firefox + noscript plugin can selectively block it from happening.

t1_dudg5ab	-0.202300	*	This is a different faction. The SDF, and it's main component, the YPG, are not part of that main bloc of rebels which you are reffering to who have often claimed similar.

t1_duhapb5	0.000000	*	 Cuz all his peers are doing it?
t1_duog4ez	-0.859300	*	Mask or no mask? I think yes but avoid black face? It will not be the most accurate T'challa so that may ruin the cosplay.

t1_duk7y1q	0.128000	*	One difference in my mind is that there has been virtually no movement in the peace process since Oslo (90s).   The NAFTA stuff... is just empty posturing.

t1_dv1qrwp	-0.458800	*	I'm wondering how long its been since anything Trump did was actually something he wasn't told to do by his handlers and owner. He's just paying off debt and hoping Mueller is abducted at this point.

t1_dv0jl4b	0.680800	*	North Korea? They're pretty much keeping North Korea afloat and giving them military tech. I'd consider them allies.
t1_dv4w0dv	-0.648300	*	The lack of campaign finance laws makes it impossible not to reward corruption. Money talks is the basis of our political system.

t1_dv00zk7	0.726900	*	How well did that work in the 2000s for Zimbabwe? Idiots like Malema will just take control of the land and keep the vast majority of yields for the elite. Thisll lead to greater starvation.
t1_dubt67a	0.000000	*	This makes me genuinely wonder if a Princess Mononoke type film with orangutans might change some minds.
t1_duvcsk5	0.263100	*	It's a natural phenomenon caused by the split of the polar vortex. It's not global warming, or climate change. Just a rare occurrence. 
t1_dv28dhf	0.000000	*	In the meantime, they keep selling stuff made by cheap labor in Vietnam and Bangladesh.
t1_dv0fuwe	0.000000	*	Nobody is going to actually use their nukes. Not even North Korea, if they're not invaded by a foreign nation.  This is just political posturing to keep the balance of diplomatic influence. 
t1_dud7es9	0.361200	*	Typical 'whataboutism'. Keep that for t_d like you usually do.
t1_dugmffk	-0.705000	*	The news source has no creditability but check out the video on that page @2:55. This actual story has tell-tale signs of bullshit, but the IDF is not above this type of behaviour either.
t1_dul8l5n	-0.401900	*	Nandos is trash, expensive as fuck for chicken and chips with some spice thrown on top. Literally can make the same thing at home for a fraction of the price.

t1_dubrykd	-0.458800	*	The French are assisting the Malian military fight this group. It's not bombs on muslims, it's french military helping some muslims fight other muslims. 
t1_duconip	0.000000	*	> This will be the thing that we all believe will finally bring down Trump  Nobody is claiming that.  This is just one more step in the road.

t1_duxokny	-0.493900	*	The main threat to this species is nets and collisions with ships. The WWF suggests not eating seafood, and if you do make sure its MSC certified
t1_dv2n2yx	-0.599400	*	Because this is directly tied to this trade war thing?
t1_dv2i7e7	0.735100	*	> Well that paints an endearing picture of an old person carefully crafting each individual peice of Lego ready to be shipped out.   Would explain the prices as well
t1_duprqng	0.226300	*	Much of that violence was stoked by the apartheid regime itself. They deliberately armed rival gangs to try and destabilise their opposition and make themselves look like the superior side.   
t1_duklenk	0.000000	*	This is almost exactly what I heard Hannity say today, with the addition that Obama needs to be called in to testify under oath about not doing anything about the Russian meddling that did not happen.

t1_duias6p	-0.742500	*	Why dont we reduce all taxes to zero, and we can all just pay voluntarily?  Rates need to be set so that the revenue is consistently applied and predictable.  Your argument is very poor.
t1_duz3rt3	0.000000	*	Water thrown at 1:19.
t1_dv4fbo1	0.000000	*	Why mention France at all? It's the EU. Harleys are sold in the EU, now they'll sell fewer.
t1_dualpue	0.747200	*	Because Putin knows Iran isn't going to attack Israel anyway, so he might as well say this and curry some favor with Israelis.
t1_dugi7j9	-0.667000	*	Russia did this better. Compare Iraq war to Syria war. Both of them got the US and Russia the oil resources eventually. Russia didn't lose much in Syria while US lost a lot in Iraq.
t1_due1xvi	-0.265400	*	The law doesn't allow for drug price negotiations. So we basically have to pay what they say.
t1_dv2hws7	-0.584800	*	But...but....all the headlines from CNN and Facebook tell everyone this is bad.  How could it possibly be good?!

t1_duxu2db	0.566100	*	lol. Just type it into a search engine. Would a CNN article work better for you? or maybe msnbc or al-jazeera. Such a joke when people say shit like this. How lazy and dim do you have to be?

t1_duh40es	0.000000	*	Did you read the memo?
t1_dueswhw	0.000000	*	Unlikely. $150k in election ads is nothing for a multi billion dollar company.  It's likely costing them tens millions of dollars in stock sales at the least.

t1_dv5dtzb	-0.899700	*	Must be why the EU are so scared. A US-EU trade war would hurt European exports without hurting American exports (since no one wants to buy American)

t1_duoretn	-0.177900	*	You do realize Russian authorities are the ones who notified Argentina of the drug-dealing in the first place? That's like blaming the Mexican cartel on Trump.

t1_dv5speu	-0.594500	*	Most of the cheating was happening on the vehicles with SCR. They put quite small DEF tanks on them and made them non end user refillable and wanted the tanks to last for a whole service cycle.
t1_dum68w2	-0.510300	*	Finding new ways of pissing people off in the Middle East is not going to improve our security as a country. Isn't that important to you guys?

t1_dut0hku	0.401900	*	Yes.
t1_dur51rj	-0.117900	*	Uhh do you realise that Russia is banned from competing at the Winter Olympics? What stronger measures do you want them to take?

t1_dv349v8	0.361200	*	That's like comparing Breitbart to North Korea.
