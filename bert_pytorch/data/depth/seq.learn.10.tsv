t1_dutkuxk	1	*	yeah, which is why every study done has a section about potential limitations and issues within the study, etc. Scientists are skeptical of other science as well. 
t1_dutwd22	1	*	That's why science experiments are repeated multiple times to see if the same results are reproduced. Unfortunately, reproduction studies are underappreciated and underfunded.
t1_dutsqux	1	*	> still end up a Trump if you refuse to listen.  Billionaire, media mogul and president?
t1_dutj6i0	0	*	You can add Bush in that list, though he seems like a cool guy to have a beer with
t1_dutqulk	0	*	You are seriously advocating the government forcing people (at gunpoint, as all laws are backed by force) to vaccinate... All the while, they can easily mandate people diet just the same.
t1_duto2u0	0	*	At that point in the virus' progression, isn't the alternative 100% certain death?
t1_duu1tqs	0	*	I think might be taking it a bit far....and dark.
t1_dutitvy	1	*	Good to know. I might do the Minute Clinic suggestion someone brought up.
t1_dutyixh	1	*	VaATC well put. My own immune system aint that great, herd immunity is best for me and others like me. Your idea on education is absolutely on point.
t1_dutuuc3	0	*	In general, I think not aborting children with severe congenital conditions is just cruel. 
t1_dutmxh4	0	*	Id much have a die hard republican family than one that is die hard anti vaccine.
t1_dutqxvb	0	*	1 time.  Just after a vaccine... Ever.  Yeah, it was the vaccine.
t1_dutleym	1	*	Being proportionally represented by a parliament rather than having this two-party pendulum swinging around helps a lot.  
t1_duv7yov	1	*	I'm imagining someone arguing that 2 + 2 = Saturn and I can't think of any reason anyone needs to listen to that besides bewildering amusement.
t1_dutnbo1	0	*	He wasn't calling you one, calm down.
t1_dutwcgt	1	*	That's why science experiments are repeated multiple times to see if the same results are reproduced. Unfortunately, reproduction studies are underappreciated and underfunded.
t1_duto7sg	0	*	You also put them at risk by vaccinating.  http://vaccine-injury.info/
t1_dutk4og	0	*	But theyre better than idiots that dont use any type of evidence or logic in decision making.....
t1_dutzr0c	0	*	Historically, it was mostly a thing among Christian Scientists (I.e, members of the Church of Christ, Scientist).
t1_duuh7cd	1	*	True. But the result is very similar. It's called positive assortative mating.
t1_dutlel5	0	*	If you're going to continue to hammer this point, correct spelling would lend greater legitimacy to your argument. It's (IN OBNOXIOUS ITALICS) superseded (END OBNOXIOUS ITALICS), NOT 'supersceded'
t1_duto09v	0	*	I don't suggest anything, I just think there needs to be an awareness of the dangers so people can make informed decisions and not just parrot hype.  It's a real problem.
t1_dutva0i	1	*	Yea, Trump did so terrible before he became PRESIDENT.  What the hell have you done even remotely comparable?
t1_dutmevp	0	*	Yes? 
t1_dutyh1w	1	*	I knew I should have gotten the Dalek vaccine. 
t1_duxh2mh	0	*	You've missed the point, but it doesn't matter. Looks like you are just being confrontational without having a real purpose.
t1_dutr3nb	1	*	And yet the NRA didnt overthrow it with their shooty toys, although they jerk it to the second amendment so much.
t1_dutpn9g	0	*	Damn that seems super late! I'm pretty sure you can get it at any age but I think once you hit (around) 50 the chances increase dramatically. 
t1_duuftx6	0	*	Indeed. I should note that I never attacked vaccines in particular with that argument. My concerns have been with over prescribed medicines and the vitamin industry.
t1_dutlvik	0	*	VACCINATE U0001f414 YOUR U0001f414 FUCKING U0001f414 CLUCKS 
t1_dutnz14	0	*	Nope.  I don't want them to die from a vaccine either.
t1_duurwqh	1	*	https://www.statista.com/statistics/265102/revenues-in-the-global-vaccine-market/   Updated new source with a chart -   
t1_dutppek	1	*	yeah.. you gotta be specific with trust here.   It's not similar to trust the government in terms of stealing money, to they're going to drug us all involuntarily to dumb us down.
t1_dutnh1e	0	*	All are just in their own mind. I'm sure racists have reasons it's OK too. 
t1_dutr4kw	0	*	Whatever, I had them, no scars whatsoever.
t1_duuf4ie	0	*	Your link just says that everything is much cheaper in Greece.
t1_dutoxa7	0	*	Hey, Chris Cornell sang about it in [Outshined](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=EWtvbqc6mVM). It must be true.
t1_dutoz2z	0	*	Awesome, thanks, I'll have to re-evaluate my assumptions on the matter. I was being too simplistic I suppose.
t1_duu4haf	1	*	Those churches are the minority. Extreme minority not even worth mentioning, if it's the ones in thinking of. 
t1_dutqles	1	*	It's debatable.  There is a very fine line of self-awareness between the words eugenics and natural selection.
t1_dutoqmd	0	*	With the open support of 99.99% of the medical community?
t1_dutl6h6	0	*	>Mate, it wasnt even that long ago.  50 years is a pretty long time.
t1_dutyqi8	1	*	10,000 years of eating gluten and all of a sudden in the last decade everyone has a gluten allergy. On the plus side those actually with celiac are benefiting..
t1_dutyfcy	1	*	Thanks, I hope the best for you as well. Thanks for reading my venting. :)
t1_duua5es	1	*	That's true, but I think there's also some level of stare into the abyss too long, and the abyss stares into you going on.
t1_dutr2h5	0	*	Two different things.  Apples & Rocks.
t1_duts72v	0	*	Soooo TIL??
t1_dv2fn8i	1	*	How so? I am one...
t1_duto5yb	0	*	*you're   Maybe, I didn't say we should kill them. I said there should be just as serious consequences for them as for the ones exposed to pathogens that could be eradicated by proper vaccination
t1_duu6goy	1	*	Well damn. Im just happy I caught it before it got really bad. 
t1_dutsaec	0	*	Portuguese here.  We dont trust our government with money because they just love to fill their pockets. But we still trust them that they arent interested in using us as guinea pigs.
t1_dutjzrt	1	*	You are right, shingles is a resurgence of chicken pox. It can be triggered by stress. 
t1_dutr86k	0	*	So basically you are against government mandated vaccines and not vaccines in general?
t1_dutx1n8	1	*	Good to hear you have amenable opinions.
t1_dumbey2	0	*	Really? So who do I blame for infants getting spinal cancer? Did they just not work hard enough?
t1_dv483cv	0	*	That fuck cunts it.
t1_dv4gk89	0	*	What's your net worth, and why should I listen to someone that started off with more than me but has earned less?
t1_dv48zes	0	*	Am Australian. Can confirm.
t1_dv4ryvp	1	*	Lots of NZ has reasonably priced fibre. 100 megabit is $100 a month I think.
t1_dv4gnrf	1	*	You should toss some commas in there. 
t1_dv4e0vc	0	*	But am I actually getting the correct speeds just in a different unit?
t1_dv4qizp	1	*	NZ is kicking aus butt now we have been steady rolling out fiber to the home in all our city's and many of the bigger towns. So we are at 66mbs aus is at 26mbs. Ranked 21 and 56 respectively.
t1_dv4b3x0	1	*	*multiple 'can confirms' incoming*
t1_dv4jlbr	1	*	Yeah, I was thinking about that. So are bytes considered...base 8? Is that the mathematical term? Base 8?   Edit: never mind, it's base 2.   Edit 2: base 2 or base 10, I'm not sure anymore. 
t1_dv4wyjs	0	*	Huh. Weird. Maybe it's a problem with the infrastructure then.
t1_dv4vzaw	1	*	Audio files are also massive. Games like The Witcher 3, Skyrim and GTA5 have insane amounts of it that just weren't around in previous games.
t1_dv4h3q2	1	*	Let me welcome you to our glorious country of India then. 1, 2 and 5 mbps down/up connections are still the norm here.
t1_dv4odru	0	*	That sounds illegal.
t1_dv4ccmr	1	*	Yep, only got lightning fast 5mbps download in the last 2 years, upload maybe 1.5mbps. Before that it was 800kbps down, and god help you if you wanted to upload something. 
t1_dv49e0g	0	*	confirmed even 4G in Hong Kong is better than Australia.
t1_dv4jjcu	1	*	Am Australian, people bitch about NBN but it's fixed my house, I have pretty much on average 75 download/30 upload at both my houses, rarely ever dips, usually gets higher. 
t1_dv49tx2	1	*	Bits or bytes, that is some awful bandwidth.
t1_dv49k8x	1	*	I have what is considered to be the best internet out of most of my friends, with 100 mbps down 2 up
t1_dv4kcgk	0	*	Did you get your base 2 and base 10 backwards in your first paragraph? Mega, Giga, etc, is base 2. 
t1_dv59wx9	0	*	Dude, good luck with your recovery.
t1_dv49ed6	1	*	Some of my favorite YouTubers live in Australia and they always mention the fact that their internet is shit.
t1_dv4a4ow	1	*	Living on 10-20/1 is fun /s Plus it drops out all the time
t1_dv4khvc	1	*	Agreed, I can't say I've seen it when dealing with networking (base 10 e.g. megabit, gigabit etc.). It seems it's the standard unit for consumers' services.
t1_dv4npmz	0	*	I have the same plan with them. I barely get over 10/2 and 8/0.2 is more common. It hasn't changed after getting a new modem either.
t1_dv4b6k8	0	*	Sandvine? And yeah to hell with that company and their deceitful tomfuckery. 
t1_dv49iz8	1	*	Mobile data is expensive for a home connection though
t1_dv4dhni	1	*	Nz Internet is actually pretty good. Fast speeds at reasonable prices. The only thing is ping but that's just because we're so geographically isolated from everyone.
t1_dv4bmzn	0	*	Yah I'd probably do what you did too. 250 is right on the cusp of Unnecessary. A gig is definitely not necessary, but FUCK it feels good to finish a 3 gig torrent in a matter of minutes  
t1_dv49t7x	1	*	In NZ, we have pretty good speeds. In Aus... not so much.
t1_dv4a8e4	1	*	Am non-metropolitan American adjacent to regional city, can confirm we have all the shitty internet and no V8 Holdens.
t1_dv4dwmm	0	*	To anyone reading this, get the Chase Sapphire preferred.   50k points if you spend 4k in the first three months. I paid rent with mine for a $30 fee. $120 for $750 in points.
t1_dv49z02	0	*	You can't have that in a system designed like ours - we aren't a multiparty one  like Europe. It's two-party only in the House of Reps
t1_dv4hl81	1	*	Australian here; 5mbs download, 0.2 mbps upload (yay?)
t1_dvak0nh	0	*	Bell's almost always given me perfect speeds. Now I'm paying for 1Gb on Rogers and only getting ~780, but I don't know what I should expect at these speeds
t1_dv4kc13	1	*	Colorado would be glad to have you, Gaben
t1_dv4w8u8	0	*	Ah, I guess I didn't know that 1 byte is 8 bits either. Lots of things I don't know today
t1_dv4lb23	0	*	Yeah  but theres only so many unit's with so many verticies. For 17g you'd expect something a bit better than fixed 2.5d
t1_dv4zehp	0	*	So its not finished.  Good thing no one wants to explain how something thats being constantly updated is also finished?  Wtf.
t1_dv49ldr	1	*	1.1 Mb/s download, gotta love Australian internet.

t1_ds5iht1	1	*	Would you care to explain why? 
t1_ds5exzd	0	*	Yeah no way in hell that I'm publicly sharing my own salary.  But there should be something where Employers should publicly state the average salary of their jobs so that everyone knows the average.  
t1_ds5h30e	0	*	Funny thing is my wife was the one pushing me to be more aggressive negotiating (and it worked).  She is a little tiger.
t1_ds5ctoi	0	*	But there is discrimination - you're paying women less...

t1_ds5fh3l	1	*	Where does this happen?
t1_ds5f493	1	*	Fair enough.
t1_ds5fi7j	0	*	...because of a 1963 law called the equal pay act.  You cant pay your female employees less than the men for doing the same job lol its in the freakin law.  
t1_ds5d2dm	0	*	Just keep good documentation if you ever start a business cause a judge isn't gonna give a shit how you think it should be
t1_duqm52c	0	*	Starting an invasion to overthrow a government and assassinate a president in reaction to nationalizing the Suez Canal should be considered an actual war crime.

t1_dti83e9	1	*	They were only asking for $1B

t1_du1bw34	0	*	You think Syrians where operating the complex systems? I'd think Russia was at least in involved in the operation, by sending operators. 
t1_dto4eb6	1	*	Yeah, but u/effedup is going to get upvotes anyways because this shit site has lost its mind in conspiracies and anti-Russian sentiment in every possible way.

t1_dto1xlg	1	*	But of course trump still has to fight the deep state because otherwise hed just be a rambler
t1_dto98c5	1	*	See all those downvotes? That means you said something true. 
t1_dtoot9o	1	*	Canada is still pretty relaxed about that. Trudeua and Harper still went about their daily routines without tons of security escorts and often appeared at events within arms reach or the public.

t1_dto6le0	0	*	I see what you are saying, but I don't like how the US is stating that they will pull out if their demands are not met.  
t1_dtnw3hr	1	*	It's talking about passive investing. It is easy. You just buy an ETF of the actual index and sit on it until it's time to cash out. No active managing or frequent trading required.

t1_dto13fm	1	*	Fair enough!  I too thought it was probably, but have no idea if it is or isnt

t1_durith5	0	*	No, I'm not going to compare 300,000 to 17 million because that's comparing a 6 week death toll to a 6 year death toll.   You know that as well as I do. Stop it with your false equivalency.

t1_duso6b6	0	*	Ok man. No hard feelings. 
t1_durc3bk	1	*	You can't convict a husband and wife for the same crime. 
t1_duric0b	1	*	every - designates someone else talking.
t1_durl835	0	*	Well good.  I don't think he should have apologized.  It was a military decision to end the war.
t1_duripi7	1	*	I think they still have to acknowledge that those bombed were human beings.
t1_durrrar	1	*	> American Civil War  Same here. Except in my school, and at home, it was the War of Northern Aggression.
t1_durkj86	0	*	I could've list a hundred more. There are plenty choose from. It was one example off the top of my head. Nowhere did I say the only atrocity was in nanking?  
t1_durc4py	0	*	>Its almost like where you are and the quality of your education play a major role in what you learn   No one was ever saying this isn't true 
t1_durh3vb	1	*	I thought Germans were really good at math.   
t1_durdoks	1	*	I like your hope but I'm positive you're wrong
t1_dursrzq	0	*	don't, the dude who wrote it is so biased against anything nuclear that he believes that even nuclear power is the devil. 
t1_dur81ug	1	*	I see you have a very nuanced view on this
t1_duslldz	0	*	Nah, just hate people like you.
t1_dur86yn	0	*	What did the Germans do with the refugees? 
t1_dursdwi	0	*	Why would I bother discussing with someone who tells me to go fuck myself? Waste of time. Bye :)
t1_durm7ob	1	*	read books, they exist
t1_durb58g	1	*	Double jeopardy
t1_durhfdl	1	*	Everything I know about WWI I learned from Dan Carlin
t1_durf0ob	0	*	Professor Schweppes from War 101? Hey it's Chad here!
t1_durc8il	0	*	It's also extremely common to assume that homeless people are lying about their situation so we can avoid empathy. 
t1_durjsed	1	*	Maybe I just grew up with a different school then.  I remember when I was taught it, they didn't downplay what we did in any way.  I can see your point if not everyone was taught that.
t1_durov1u	1	*	Obviously - otherwise he would have occupied Oceania or S. America and built out from there.
t1_dusryhw	0	*	> an aircraft carrier.  Don't need one of those when it's 50 kms between your countries, dude.
t1_durc4wd	0	*	So when you use your anecdotal evidence about regional education... What was the point?
t1_durczlg	0	*	Equal? So youre cool with Japan parading their victims while still denying their war crimes? Doesnt sound equal to me. 
t1_dutdn9d	0	*	> Japan was bound to open up at some point.  Oh absolutely, no doubt, but forcing them at gunpoint sets a bad precedent.
t1_durishy	0	*	Public forum. I can say and feel however I like. Yay 21st century freedoms.
t1_durb5b4	0	*	The US and every other country in WW2 mass bombed cities. That's just how total war was conducted back then
t1_durctk4	0	*	Then it would just be about the Jews and how the Nazi's are trying to get the Holy Grail to save us from the Jews.
t1_durxcnv	1	*	Yep. That's the extent of how fanatical the Japanese were.  There were still those willing to fight to the bitter end even after the bombs dropped.
t1_duray8l	1	*	You are thinking of double jeopardy, and yes Germany does provide protections against it if a final verdict is declared. 
t1_durb4bb	0	*	Eh, he wasn't tried by germans the first time so it doesn't really apply.
t1_durhd72	0	*	At least they didnt go in against a Sicilian when death was on the line  
t1_durkpno	0	*	What apology?
t1_durkbc1	0	*	That's the lamest excuse for being wrong I've ever heard. Either way, millions of Jews and other minorities were both killed and burned.
t1_dureloo	1	*	Okay me too thanks. 
t1_duywim1	0	*	It's like the fifth amendment, where you're not required to incriminate yourself.
t1_durbo25	0	*	We learned about WW1 at least 3 times in secondary school in the UK (and probably once or twice in primary school as well).
t1_durtcq6	0	*	Japaneses internment vs Japan spreading plague over Chinese cities for research. Google Japanese Unit 731 to see just how fucked up Japan was during WWII
t1_durlhsp	0	*	I think he was looking for an example as to who said the attack on Pearl Harbor was 'the war's worst atrocity'
t1_duredtb	0	*	So like everybody else? Nobody believes themselves to be the villain in reality... And yet...
t1_dut7a8h	1	*	I'm Canadian
t1_dutkas0	1	*	I'm old...so so old. My coonskin coat has shed.
t1_durq7hq	1	*	The American support of anti-democratic military governments in Latin America in the 70s and early 80s was a nightmare from which most of those countries can't still fully recover. 
t1_dure8us	1	*	I stand amused. Dickhead.
t1_dusew8t	0	*	Ignore him and the other jingoistic psychos. 
t1_dus43t9	1	*	It would matter because they would be publicly admitting to breaking signed Conventions if they prosecuted the Axis for those things.
t1_durd7nl	0	*	But you're just changing the subject completely.  That has nothing to do with what these people have to share with other people.  
t1_duravdi	0	*	Yep. Never underestimate the level of distilled stupid humanity can offer up.
t1_durovvx	1	*	Worked for the Mongols. Piss-poor idea for pretty much everyone else though...
t1_du7kiwr	1	*	That's not what expanding a statement means, learn to English better 
t1_du78ttm	0	*	He can history dive all he wants on me. I only wanted to know the acronym and now i do. Any how, I think he's just a troll, or that's how his comment history reads.
t1_du798wd	0	*	What's wrong with looking through someone's past comments? That's what they're there for.
t1_dsfgtsa	0	*	I disagree with your statement, I personally believe that some people needs government-provided help (welfare state).  I might be wrong tho, we'll never know.
t1_dsexv6y	0	*	well that's how it's supposed to work, if you oppose a certain business practice, you can communicate that with your buying power, if enough people do the same, companies notice, and adapt
t1_dsgxsvq	1	*	OK, thanks.
t1_dsf34t0	1	*	So they're in the Trump tax bracket 
t1_dshb42j	0	*	No im a capitalist. Capital leave those who don't deserve/value it to those who do.   Saying businesses have a right to exist is not socialism. 
t1_dshb7mv	1	*	Then your problem is with welfare and not the minimal wage.  The govt can provide the basic necessities for every welfare recipient for under $1000/person/month.  
t1_dsh9cz2	1	*	Which is just another way of saying If the minimum wage increase is too high the company should just fire all its workers.
t1_dsh61y3	1	*	Hyundai would be the more effective predator in the economic ecosystem. Competition weeds out what doesnt work. If the Japanese come in and do it better, faster, cheaper, then learn from them.
t1_dtblydy	1	*	Dude you are reaching SO hard to be right... it isn't working 
t1_dtbgrs6	0	*	Why is it a shitty source? Safe to say they pulled the same numbers any of us would find from sources on the internet.
t1_dtbh1pp	1	*	you don't undetstand his depth /s
t1_dtcff4r	1	*	Well put.
t1_dtcfcoi	0	*	Yeah... but I've been to countries where there is poverty and lack of work but there is not the same level of organised violence that you see from the cartels. What is the key?

t1_dtbf1t1	0	*	Mexico is hardly exporting weed these days and there isn't much cannabis related violence these days because a LOT of the weed out there is grown in a legal state and transported
t1_dtbe14s	0	*	More like, groups of people trying to maximize profits.
t1_dtb8e5h	1	*	It's not a movie. It's a video released by a cartel showing what happens when you work for the competition.
t1_dtcb0i3	0	*	What's the incentive for these countries to fix themselves? the people are too cowed to rise up and those in power are happy with the status quo.
t1_dtcbubq	0	*	Change is never easy - if it was, it would just happen.  Tree of liberty needs to be fed once in awhile.

t1_dtci812	1	*	This is the reason I switched to Fanta and Dassani years ago ^^^/^^^s
t1_dst78z4	1	*	You fit perfectly in the box of crypto-fascism. You admire fascist ideology, but you're too much of a pussy to carry the consequences. Hence why your mother raised a bitch.
t1_dst7kab	1	*	No one called you a Nazi but a fascist.
t1_dstey4d	0	*	He made an argument to support his claim. Feel free to make one in opposition.
t1_dtgmk5z	0	*	Would you care to provide a statement where Obama and Hillary denounces the rumors that they are man eating space lizards?
t1_dtfjumz	0	*	Yeah it's abundantly clear you don't want to hear facts that don't suit your world view.  I'm happy to stop wasting any time on you.
t1_dtg0zdb	0	*	Oh, I don't know, how about George Papadopolous? He's singing like a canary. Rumors are that Richard Gates is also negotiating terms.  Indictments are used as leverage to induce cooperation.
t1_dtgrxnw	0	*	Your brother is going to be the next Popeye's lady!
t1_dtgeogj	1	*	I mean, it's not like there are any requirements or talents needed for that. Just a half-decent poker face and obedience.

t1_dtf8x2h	1	*	Why are you so upset?  I hope you have a nice day.
t1_dtfzqmz	1	*	Ok but I dont know what that is. 
t1_dtfzlfq	1	*	It is more of an investment.
t1_dtg07xd	0	*	Oh no. You don't get to walk on conspiracy unless you have something. A much bigger something. Time will tell.
t1_dtf812n	0	*	Make up bullshit, get called out, act like pompous asshole. The modern day left, everyone! 
t1_dtgjh5z	1	*	Well done
t1_dtf9r2y	0	*	President DJT fired the Flynns. Why should the US President have to denounce every conspiracy theory out there?
t1_dtc9hq9	0	*	that was an ex schoolyard, not in use anymore. you can't just kill, displace, and overall torment people and then turn around and blame them for it

t1_dt4le56	1	*	Dude no, it was a joke read the comments i made afterwards

t1_ds4jesq	0	*	This is one of NK's more quirky and less death camp-y facts, I'm glad I was informed of this
t1_ds4uaez	1	*	Still arguing against a definition? You must be famished for attention. 
t1_duonm81	1	*	He removed a comment that said Hamilton blew up that argument in my face. Here's my response: Nah, Fuck Hamilton. Never has there been a thing so insufferable, overrated, and pompous than that garage.
t1_duoc3l9	1	*	Yeah, I guess, I admit its been a long time since I've watched them.

t1_duo9j5w	0	*	That doesn't validate your point. You can't use an ancient Egyptian person to play the role of an ancient Egyptian because they don't exist anymore. That's not true for French people. 
t1_duouat8	0	*	The character from the get go was meant to be played by a white person. The premise is not the same.

t1_dtidh91	1	*	There was also that Judge he said couldn't be fair because the judge had Mexican ancestry.  http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/article/2016/jun/08/donald-trumps-racial-comments-about-judge-trump-un/
t1_du46xjb	1	*	Making money via wars is unethical to the max. No wonder why I'm a Marxist and a pacifist.
t1_du3qttp	0	*	Same thing; different era: Japanese had the equivalent of Caebol nearly a century ago.
t1_dt6h2rp	1	*	I dont agree with this you heard him, let it go

t1_dshs7qs	1	*	Since everyone else in this subthread was [talking about this specific topic], maybe you should preface with that.
t1_dsg0nud	1	*	I'm sorry, but you're talking a crock of shite. 
t1_du8znt9	0	*	Look up Steve Jobs. He registered in multiple states to have a higher chance.  That's exploitative already.

t1_du8pu1b	0	*	Crusading ofc.
t1_duixsee	1	*	Thanks :)
t1_du8wem8	0	*	It's happening already. Rich people have access to better healthcare than poor people. Getting priority on donated organs isn't too out of the realm. 
t1_dv1aicr	0	*	You are the one who can't separate his personal opinion, by not realizing how your default is just as much of a decision being made.  
t1_du8zpkw	0	*	That's why I take things further than most people though. I think peoples believes about being against abortion, against gay marriage, against trans people etc are harmful and should not be respected.
t1_du952xp	0	*	Did you just call me the R word? How anti-progressive of you. 
t1_du8hyp3	0	*	Good luck having a sex life at all without showering.

t1_du8dgbd	0	*	Uptight is still better than corrupt. 
t1_du8vavi	1	*	> There's also at least one doctor who's been accused of hastening a patient's death to harvest his organs.  It would be great to have a source to read more about it.
t1_du8lixi	0	*	ahhh so... you're an utterly insane person? Equating a human baby growing in the womb with harmful bacteria? Got it.
t1_du8urzk	0	*	You need the dollar that bad in order to go sign up?Id gladly send you it. 
t1_du96fjh	1	*	Not judging, just for future reference. 
t1_du9fo5w	1	*	Which would have a lot more legitimacy if you were forthright and not masquerading bullshit as too personal to back up your, at face value, nonsensical opinion.
t1_du8gjgh	0	*	So that means my wishes are null and void? The wishes of my family? 
t1_du8k5iv	0	*	People are lazy, I am lazy. No matter how easy the process is, I wont go out of my way to become an organ donor. I doubt Im alone in being that lazy.
t1_du8n9u7	1	*	Which isnt actually happening you edgy teen wannabe.
t1_du92627	1	*	Lmao you are so dense
t1_du8gy47	0	*	just checked mine. unfortunately it doesnt appear to be legal here. as a prison inmate, will I still be able to donate my organs? 
t1_du9dok1	0	*	Because these people care about what happens with the body. They get to attend the funeral for example. 
t1_du9adh3	1	*	Aye, I reckon healthcare is a human right like food. It doesn't have to be free, but it should be easily affordable by all, at least.
t1_du8k44r	0	*	>Being ranked lower actually equals death in many cases.  Which only happens because people arent donors, which is what youre supporting...
t1_du93vqi	1	*	You're gonna trust the insane doctor??? 
t1_du8zcyw	1	*	Yes.  You are not allowed to mutilate the body at all (Piercing , shaving with blades , tattoos and autopsies.  Donating body parts is also not allowed , receiving donating is ok.. 
t1_du9ggus	0	*	Yes you do have a choice. You opt-out. I dont get what the problem is. 
t1_du8hobc	0	*	 even having half good insurance here and you end up paying tens of thousands :( really hoping thease shitheads in office come up with something haha
t1_du8iblu	0	*	Murder them then donate their organs too
t1_du8fv5q	1	*	If you don't think receiving only half of what you would get otherwise, no biggie right?
t1_du8fzwd	1	*	Drive safely....or not! Either way works for us! 
t1_du8kvfk	1	*	No, you don't grasp the concept of consent... if the government is choosing for you... you have no consent there.
t1_du8mef6	0	*	And now he's chosen to be an organ donor because he opted-in without having to do anything. ;)
t1_du8gydo	0	*	Nah, you can keep them.
t1_du8isrx	0	*	This may be true. It is also true that some people die as a result of denied organ donation.  Perhaps if there was consequences to the decision to withhold, then we wouldn't need to rely on altruism. 
t1_du8b6k1	0	*	Let's not, we've got enough of those around.
t1_du8w0hq	1	*	Fair enough.  I'm an OR nurse so I never actually come in contact with the families.
t1_du8fzzg	0	*	That's very untrue. Choices are made for you by your government every day (depending on what government you're under, but still). 
t1_du8vwz8	1	*	Not even if you donated it.
t1_du97sy7	1	*	I don't know, I'm not Dutch. I would imagine that there are categories though. It's fairly easy to make a living will/body will and it's very much honored by medical professionals. 
t1_du8umy0	1	*	You have a right to feel that way but it would go counter of the Hippocratic Oath. Money aside, you can't hold one's beliefs against them in choosing to treat or not. 
t1_du9whel	0	*	So, what should be the next step. Every person should be obliged to donate blood on a weekly bases?
t1_du8t9hb	0	*	I'm doing all that, and then having my ashes put into [a biodegradable tree urn] (https://urnabios.com/)
t1_du8ghc1	0	*	A choice is made for you either way, the choice to leave your corpse to rot and let it all go to waste, while people potentially die as a result.  
t1_du93zt7	0	*	Then shouldn't have any problem getting those laws reversed correct? 
t1_duahh4w	1	*	yeah that's where I differ I guess. maybe it'll change as I get older but as of now I don't see anything to be afraid of really
t1_du8ykw3	0	*	It isn't really a holy land.
t1_du8hlkv	0	*	Also, check if they are organ donors first.
t1_du94v35	1	*	Yup, at least 20% of all US abortions are via medication.
t1_du8eysk	0	*	I'll take any trade at this point. Senate, house, President, cops, anything!!!
t1_du9277z	1	*	So if a social democracy voted to enslave a minority of the population, that would be morally ok and nobody's rights would be violated? Just the price of the social contract? Seems dubious to me.
t1_du8np56	1	*	No? I dont really see the connection here?
t1_du8ozbi	0	*	It's their informed choice based on their beliefs, I can't say much against that. I can disagree with it, but in the end it is their choice.
t1_duap5m2	1	*	> you can study to be a doctor  Yeah, sure. I'll take my $200 and do that.
t1_du8rpef	1	*	If I had to guess, hes a Palestinian living in Israel with Israeli citizenship. In that case, settlers would probably be people living in illegal settlements that are encroaching on the West Bank.
t1_du8qj30	1	*	true 
t1_du93co4	0	*	Did you miss the part where you're dead?
t1_du8mu49	1	*	Lol
t1_du9raf7	0	*	You have the choice to **opt out** or **not opt out** though?
t1_du8hfdw	0	*	Your religion/tradition allows you to be kept alive by receiving organs but not doing the same for others? Sounds like a scummy religion/tradition.
t1_du9djjy	1	*	They're probably the people that care the most about your body. It's why we have funerals and such and don't merely dump the body in a garbage container. 
t1_du90lqd	0	*	Then opt out if you'd rather take the selfish route. It's optional.
t1_du8gh42	1	*	to put it in the will can take weeks or months, depending on where you are, because the will, will need to be authenticated then executed. Even worse if it is disputed in probate court. 
t1_du9ldks	0	*	 So you are ok if your organs are given to Nazis?
t1_dt34xwl	1	*	Yup millions are wrong. Millions have screwed up morals supporting a pro pedo religion.
t1_dt3n2ft	1	*	> No one's saying that.  then what are you saying? 
t1_dt3n3ai	1	*	So then what are you implying?
t1_dt4kgw2	1	*	Yeah, no, I clocked him at at least 103 Trump defending posts. Then again, I can see you are similar to him.

t1_dtpkcip	0	*	History and reputation sort of matter, don't you think?
t1_dtpiqky	0	*	Well we'll see won't we. 
t1_dtp7mne	1	*	RT is broadcast all over the world, comes in the same packages as CNN, Al-Jazeera and BBC.
t1_dtp3jfz	1	*	No, its not both. They cant be refusing to label something for fear of islamophobia if they dont have the data to label it in the first place.
t1_dtp426o	1	*	Because not all NGOs are not for profit. 
t1_dtp4ghj	0	*	 Interesting. What's the difference?
t1_dtq7mvf	1	*	*I miss you more then Ben Affleck needs acting school*  *He was so terrible in that film*
t1_dtp61tc	1	*	No one said they were owned. The original claim was that they took money from aj.

t1_dtp59fd	1	*	/pol/ was not mentioned until you brought it up. TYT has had a partnership with AJ+ (Source : TYT youtube channel, found after googling two words.)  Troll harder bro.
t1_dtpa95l	1	*	I didn't even get that impression. I took it as that's how awful war is on all sides. It could be self defense, it could be asshole soldiers. The shit happens and it's awful. 
t1_dtp5chb	1	*	Good, now hopefully he knows it's better to look into something yourself and not to trust random internet people to spoon feed you info.

t1_dtqe4zp	1	*	There are very robust mechanisms to ensure the BBC's editorial independence. RT is directly controlled from the Kremlin.

t1_ds3ccuc	0	*	And you are incredibly naive. Do you understand where all this unchecked proliferation invariably leads to?
t1_ds4hz0f	1	*	Correct, but China also never signed an arms reduction or limitation treaty (as far as I know) so *declared* is an understatement.

t1_dulbr9y	0	*	Because America is wrong. 
t1_dul4fsv	1	*	The second way is uncommon.   It is British English, I suspect dating to the days of the Royal Navy where the biggest ships were referred to as capital  ships.

t1_dsku5b9	0	*	Welfare queen is how the right portrays all people on welfare. It was ironic. I think you need more context on American politics or a less holier than thou attitude.

t1_dsksk0n	1	*	Of that I'm unsure. I have read several armchair political diatribes calling for open borders, more intellectual than political.
t1_dskme0i	0	*	Yeah, America prefers sexual harassment in entertainment, politics and school shootings.

t1_dsxznar	0	*	No, but I can send your regards at the next meeting of the Daves.
t1_dsythd0	1	*	Most likely. I've heard it so much I thought it was true until I started Googling for it.  Timing was very fortunate.

t1_dsxn42w	0	*	Dont care 
t1_dsxvoys	1	*	Yes
t1_dsxvrmr	0	*	You said that Losing benefits is not a pay cut.  That is technically incorrect You tried to mislead by equating pay in pay in pay cut entirely with wages.

t1_dtvr1sa	0	*	But its not like we can just sit by and do nothing in the mean time.  
t1_dtvnxyp	0	*	I don't think that hold water either.  Lions are endangered.  Deer are not.  Hunting lions threatens their existence.  I think hunting a lion in nature is worse, if anything.
t1_dtvj9px	0	*	I've only seen big game be used to refer to even larger animals like elephants, lions, rhinos, etc?
t1_dtvfl6m	1	*	No: justifying something unpleasant because there are beneficial indirect consequences is shitty utilitarianism regardless of where it's applied.

t1_dtwvgvq	1	*	you may not be an idiot but you sure are a coward.
t1_dtvmo8q	0	*	Can we eat meat? Does it keep us alive? Therefore we eat meat to survive. Why don't we just subsist off of tasteless, bland soy + fiber + vitamin globs of mush?
t1_dtvrzsl	0	*	Neither are arbitrary.
t1_dtvgqy9	0	*	no, people who slaughter for fun. but that's hilarious so im leaving it. 
t1_dtvfovj	0	*	In 500 years, we'll probably find out that plants are sentient and can feel us eat and cook them alive anyway.

t1_dtvs8wv	1	*	You too thanks  EDIT: Did you change your comment from when you called me a typical pathetic internet loser?
t1_dtvnqf3	0	*	People have to eat. Yes, you can argue that people should just eat plants, but thats not always an option.  
t1_dtvkj99	1	*	Another comment full of red herrings. 
t1_dtx1i8i	0	*	Yeah I'm a grazier with beef cattle
t1_dtvj682	1	*	But we do eat it. As opposed to going to the supermarket, buying a rack of ribs and hanging it on the mantle
t1_dtvhpz2	0	*	It sucks that animals are so tasty.
t1_dtvgi1h	0	*	I'm saying that perhaps it can work in the short-term, but our longer-term efforts should not be reliant on encouraging extremely unsavoury behaviour. This has nothing to do with 'people with money'.
t1_dtvfc72	1	*	Exactly this.
t1_dtvk1r6	0	*	> lion trophy shooting barely counts as hunting.  That may be true but its a fuck ton better than poaching.
t1_dtvtb1z	0	*	What other value would you ascribe to meat that can't be gained (likely in a healthier way) without killing an animal? 
t1_dtwbzlc	1	*	Frostburg, go Bobcats.  Where is your paper?
t1_dtwc2hu	0	*	Hmm, thats why millions die in Africa due to lack of healthcare? Maybe if you hunters put your money w
t1_dtvo9jm	1	*	Me. Everybody should potato everyday and not be productive or give a shit. 
t1_dtwfi43	0	*	Glad we cleared that up. 
t1_dtwn91q	0	*	without hunters we don't need to have reserves and lions are free to roam.  The only reason why there are reserves is to protect lions from hunters.  
t1_dtw27ox	0	*	The answer is clearly no. Obviously.
t1_dtvh33f	1	*	Source?
t1_dtverl0	1	*	And a lot of good men died in that sweatshop!
t1_dtviev4	0	*	My mom used to mention it was like the concentration camp system...
t1_dtxu6rg	0	*	You said if there aren't lion nuggets then people don't eat lion and lion is therefor me a non food game animal. People eat lion in Africa. 
t1_dtvgm5e	0	*	Everyone that doesnt agree with me is mEnTaLlY ILL
t1_dtvd7xh	0	*	is it moral to kill a pet hamster in a cage for fun?

t1_dtvgudp	0	*	so it could kill my neighbors chickens.. got it
t1_dtvizo8	1	*	Nothing, because you know they're animals
t1_dtvcpwk	0	*	what I meant was any given area an animal is confined to while it's being shot at. like the area might be that big, but do they put a lion in a smaller confined area when its number is up?
t1_dtvlgdy	0	*	It would solve the problem, wouldn't it?

t1_dtvh666	0	*	not all meat is paid for. you do know meat comes from other places than the supermarket counter, right?
t1_dtvp2or	0	*	Not really, since these are the reasons they choose specific animals to hold trophy hunts for.
t1_dtvs9c9	0	*	Because both are killing animals for our pleasure, at least in the hunters case he pulls the trigger himself. Your turn, what give meat eaters the moral high ground?
t1_dtvfu6c	1	*	Pretty sure thats for falling petunias 
t1_dtvejvf	1	*	There's no shortage of national parks in SA. 
t1_dtve6ko	0	*	For what purpose? I'm not God... why the hell do they need a purpose to not be killed?
t1_dtvqxy9	1	*	I would love to shit on a poacher or canned hunter, but only if it boosts the economy 
t1_dtvgqst	0	*	why? because of what they said before. It takes no skill whatsoever to hunt one of these lions. There is no accomplishment to feel proud of. 
t1_dtvjwfu	1	*	When you don't have an argument so you pretend not to understand what an analogy is as if that somehow makes you look smart...?
t1_dtvjosv	0	*	So I guess ethics is a bit more complicated than just being about suffering after all? 
t1_dtvfkg6	0	*	Born and raised
t1_dtvfv8a	0	*	Let's be real here, Eric still does.
t1_dtx3rbv	1	*	There must be a language barrier or you're just really fucking stupid. Humans are mammals, mammals are animals. 
t1_dtvir0n	0	*	If only people weren't inherently binary you might have been on to something.
t1_dtvbr3u	1	*	it's not silly at all. it's simple understanding of animal behavior in the face of personal incentives. it's silly that you would suggest otherwise. 
t1_dtvp4yz	1	*	They might have rode in a cattle van before and think they're going to another farm.
t1_dtvip4w	0	*	Your analogy fails again because it's not illegal for the animal to perform that act, it's illegal for the human.
t1_dtvgp0c	1	*	haha, I didn't realize it read that way. I actually chuckled at how this thread sounds so im leaving it. 
t1_dtvspz0	1	*	> How is that not honorable?  Hunting for sustenance is very honorable. Those hunters are the ones that only take what they need and use as much as they can from the catch.
t1_dtvjzwf	0	*	Is there any implication here or are you just going for the facetious quip?

t1_dtvir3u	0	*	...but the ranchers are the ones concerving the animals. It's in their best interest to keep their herds healthy and alive, why should they not get the money?
t1_dtvpgqw	0	*	> You can live just as happily as a vegan  Objective study required.
t1_dtyepaz	1	*	And again, you should have mentioned specifics instead of going 'but farming'. Sounds like something you just shoehorned in to fit your narrative.
t1_dtvhz9v	1	*	Well something needs to die either way. Doesn't have to be chicken, but has to be something.
t1_dtvmvfy	1	*	Check out Earthlings. 
t1_dtvwqif	0	*	but we dont get off on killing the animal. we eat it. thats nature. spending a ton of money so you can kill something for fun is sadistic.
t1_dtvo351	0	*	Not the the animal itself. To everyone else tho,because why exactly did you have to kill a lion?
t1_dtvhrdi	0	*	Well you gotta kill something to eat
t1_dtvl2sr	1	*	You use car seats and jackets. Leather has benefits over other materials. A head on the wall is just a head on the wall.

t1_dtvl64n	1	*	Maybe not the again part. 
t1_dtvbqe4	0	*	I don't think so. im pointing out that 'usually' implies 'exceptions' are made. gee, I wonder how those 'exceptions' are made. 
t1_dtvtu6q	0	*	Unless you live somewhere that it's difficult to find other sources of protein, right, meat has no value other than pleasure.
t1_dtvj6tk	0	*	I think cancer obviously promotes more suffering than a quick death. This could be a much different conversation if lions had the ability to treat their diseases, like humans do.

t1_dtvr240	0	*	you say novelty like thats a good thing.

t1_dtvgxz2	0	*	Yes, but I don't see how my actions are relevant to the argument. Even if I were a hypocrite it wouldn't make the argument itself invalid.

t1_dsm369e	0	*	Printing more money increases inflation which devalues the currency and makes the problem worse. 
t1_dslo0ih	0	*	Wow thats a narrow way of looking at things. 
t1_dslxq26	0	*	So pay the farmers a little more. If the money is staying here, the economy as a whole will be stronger, even if all of a sudden oranges cost 5% more.

t1_dsjxb8m	0	*	At that speed you could just shoot it with a machine gun though.  A very basic radar guided anti air gun would shred these things.

t1_dunrxq5	0	*	Bitch please

t1_duooj1v	1	*	Yep, its kinda easy to notice if you follow the election via both european and us sources.  What we get in europe is pretty much cnn
t1_dunkm5e	1	*	Oh I know, their are plenty of valid reasons to hate the dude, but to say hes worse then Hitler, or even guys like Xi, Putin and Duterte is still extremely hyperbolic.
t1_duoz3xb	0	*	It's only Men in Black meme. I even said tongue in cheek.

t1_dunfzeg	1	*	Maybe he's Canadian. They like to give millions to terrorists there.
t1_dunqhe5	1	*	Their rationale is that the lack of evidence proves their deep-state conspiracy.  It's circular logic, but somehow there are so many hooked.

t1_dunms4s	0	*	As odd as it sounds a lot of people will take 80k a year and black lung to put food on the family table over a minimum wage job at Walmart.
t1_dunwnmc	0	*	> he was just responding to your violent reaction   You both defend Nazis and claim speech is violence  What the fuck?
t1_dunsdms	0	*	Correlation is not causation, and perhaps a major part of those issues is the discrimination that they face in areas such as, oh, I don't know, what types of jobs they want to get. 
t1_dunt7sc	1	*	That all makes sense.
t1_dunrjot	0	*	I didn't say anything about accepting bad ideas.  We should definitely reject bad ideas.  The problem comes when our existence revolves around hating the people who believe these bad ideas.
t1_duobzjh	0	*	Especially since they didn't properly attribute the quote or even include quotation marks.
t1_duoja8y	1	*	The only part about it that is wrong is the implication that today people don't know that.  <quietly slides tinfoil hat out of view>
t1_duo0ln4	0	*	He's completely lacking in tact and charisma, and the media hates him.
t1_dup6vrd	0	*	Well I guess we'll have to agree to disagree, I heard tons of people publicly say the only reason they preferred Hillary was because she would be the first female president.

t1_dup6xfc	0	*	Yeah rigging the primary by the dnc really shows overwhelming support by the base...Not to mention the low voter turn out in the election aka the reason Trump won.

t1_duoo33x	1	*	This is a gross misunderstanding of what being in charge is about.
t1_duo48m4	0	*	It's not that worse things happen elsewhere.  It's that saying NSA is looking at you! is being directly compared to things like killing gay people and considering them equal.

t1_duofre0	1	*	Could you list some of these establishment Democrats who fear the Left?
t1_duoglwl	0	*	That's not true, actually. The republicans passed them via reconciliation which only requires 50 votes, but also requires them to expire after 10 years.

t1_dunkurm	1	*	Political correctness does not mean treating people with respect. I think it's closer to a lopsided amount of feigned respect for certain demographics.
t1_duoklj1	1	*	Yeah it's a fact, Trump has had 5 orders blocked by the courts for violating the constitution or federal rights, the transgender military issue was just the most recent.

t1_dt30e9y	1	*	What line of argument? I wasn't disputing what you wrote. I was just providing some context, albeit in a very sarcastic tone.
t1_dt2ydmg	0	*	Not true because Mormons say they are Christian and don't believe in Christ's resurrection and even an atheist knows that makes you not Christian.
t1_dt32sj3	0	*	you'd have to ask the original commenter for that

t1_dtttgtn	0	*	That fear started well before the cold  war, and was more valid in some sense.
t1_dttcnzr	0	*	By all means, please remain in your country if you don't agree with the American spirit, but it's worked out fantastic for us over the past 200ish years.
t1_dtugj47	0	*	Then what class would it make me? I wouldn't be middle class. It isn't considered lower middle class. You do understand there are tiers.
t1_dttd1sl	0	*	Muh fallacy. You don't know what ad hominem is. I can call you an idiot without it being ad hominem. 
t1_dttj8gt	0	*	Progress is slow. You do see a shift in the younger generation but it's not gigantic.
t1_dttm189	1	*	thanks!
t1_dttewcj	0	*	What was the Duke of York named after .....  Of course, if you really want to go back, both track back to the Viking name Jorvik.
t1_dtua32p	1	*	Be a shark which eats sharks!
t1_dtuuo3u	1	*	Because a tariff would be like the state acting as a private business that charges people money to pass through their privately owned land. 
t1_dttcah4	0	*	Yes there is a difference, with one you're forced to pay money towards, the other you choose yourself. 
t1_dttdgp7	0	*	> veryone is paying more money using a private system.  I'd pay 1000x as much if it meant people weren't being stolen from.
t1_dtumh2t	0	*	Again, it was a non-issue before government intervention. 
t1_dttpymf	1	*	Except the US is planning to develop more nuclear weapons to deter people developing nuclear weapons. That's fucked.
t1_dtu5kru	0	*	Yes they have, that was bad.    But they have also made the current era the most peaceful one in human history, and if the US gave up it's place as a superpower we would all suffer for it.
t1_dttd6ki	0	*	[That's per capita](https://data.oecd.org/healthres/health-spending.htm)
t1_dttdpum	1	*	I think I read an article saying the majority of people who go bankrupt are those WITH health insurance. That's crazy. (This was before obamacare I think though.) 
t1_dttbxg9	1	*	Yeah you're right.  Conformation bias.  I deal with this every day but what do I know? Lol
t1_dttnpco	1	*	The thing is, private insurance exists in other countries too. So it's not as though they'll loose it.
t1_dtth0vn	0	*	Are you a strong guy of foreign heritage?
t1_dtu1dwb	0	*	When your course ends you are no longer in full-time education. Before your course starts you are not yet in full-time education.
t1_dtvkqi9	0	*	So what you are saying is that might makes right. I disagree.  
t1_dttg5i7	1	*	That's actually the entire Kansas city shuffle... 
t1_dttlfit	0	*	No, I'm a true-blooded, politeness loving, robin saluting, spy training, fish and chip frying, soccer watching Brit. 
t1_dtu5an3	0	*	> Other than the Tories?  Most of whom backed remain ;)
t1_dtthvad	1	*	You are the baddies. Sorry.
t1_dttgyej	1	*	No you won't be going A LOT more
t1_dttuxw8	0	*	I should be forced to pay more because people choose to not buy insurance?
t1_dttd0in	1	*	Dont be a dick and u generally get ~15%
t1_dttwitx	0	*	You sound like a fan of Obamacare. 
t1_dttwdjk	1	*	I guess you can always bake brownies.
t1_dttey8w	1	*	But he was the Duke of York because he was the Duke... of York. 
t1_dttg04c	1	*	He misspelled 'inconvenience our oil and heroin supplies'.
t1_dttmj4j	1	*	Is the policeman part really necessary seems like there is enough racism and downside that you can remove the second clsuse
t1_dttem1s	1	*	Guess it's my bad for not making it wholly obvious but yes, I know I earn more and take home more.
t1_dttevul	1	*	Yes, you're getting less for the work you do, but if you're bitter about earning more, you can give to charity which will increase your upper limit and you will pay less tax. 
t1_dtv65hc	1	*	Im a bartender and I have been at work sick with strep & pink eye before. I didnt have anyone to cover my shift. They told me to wear makeup and try not to talk to much. 
t1_dttc2xs	1	*	Stay strong
t1_dtts6mf	1	*	Im sure North Korea would prefer there to be no nuclear weapons at all, but as it is, they need them to not be invaded.
t1_dtzm68p	1	*	And that's why nobody takes you seriously. 
t1_dtthbts	1	*	Thats crazy. Ambulances arent free in Canada either (unless you have benefits that cover it). But costs are low, depending on province its like $150 to $400 (some areas are pretty remote).
t1_dtuaq6x	1	*	Well all I'm saying is not my local hospitals. Five different hospitals and various smaller doctors offices have told me basically that I'm shit outta luck until it hits collections.
t1_dtthijl	1	*	Condition 8. Isn't it the largest amount by about double to the 2nd largest? 
t1_du2lw0v	1	*	*trying to stay within a budget*  :P 
t1_dttulki	1	*	Um ,  not true.  It is your constitutional right to refuse
t1_dttfu6f	0	*	Which reminds me, thats become the retirement plan for most Americans.
t1_dttpwfi	1	*	Certainly seems to have worked for the GOP. They didn't exactly get elected because they respected their political opponents.
t1_dttbs2l	0	*	Lol.  Can't refute scientific studies?  Nah, you'll still be seen at 25.
t1_dttgc93	1	*	Bold comparison to make with North Korea about the national anthem
t1_dttc86t	0	*	Yes.  Self-centered when I think about those who have rare/uncommon diseases.  Screw them!
t1_dttd2gh	0	*	Oh man I actually just welled up. You're a very kind human being. I'll pass on the deed as soon as I'm on my feet. Thanks mate :)
t1_dtzcyvr	1	*	Thats fair enough. I'm just saying it does work, doesn't seem like it can be implemented in thw USA though
t1_dtte149	1	*	We always have that one guy who opens his mouth to prove everyone's point.
t1_dttda7q	0	*	yeah, but if you're part of the management side of the equation, it's all working for you as intended.
t1_dttbsy9	1	*	I don't think nukes are the biggest threat to America these days. 
t1_dttc4yd	0	*	<3
t1_dttdvoa	1	*	Christ, and here I was thinking just waiting in the triage was bad.
t1_dttokt2	0	*	Because thats the only robot with regulatory approval in the UK for that indication. Nobody is throwing any virgins into volcanos. Has the NHS allowed elective surgeries to resume?
t1_dttdc7x	0	*	Ok. Well you're still not dead. Which would be worse.
t1_dttf61i	0	*	Wasn'tnit called New Amsterdam first? 
t1_dttdvfu	0	*	...neener neener neener?
t1_dtuoxds	1	*	Well that's to protect the economy and create more jobs. Don't confuse that with the illegals sitting on welfare   (/S but sad)
t1_dttgm21	1	*	Thanks for sharing this! Made my morning.
t1_dttej5b	1	*	Fine if it works out. I know a few people, that would be anecdotal. Still, in the grand scheme of things, paying less while everyone is insured is superior imo.
t1_dtu7px9	1	*	No, no it does not. 
t1_dttb7e3	0	*	> They could kill more than America ever has in a war in under half an hour.  In fairness, the USA could kill a fair few more in less time.
t1_dttb6dx	1	*	As an American, I'm in the same boat as you.
t1_dttmgxt	1	*	black people are criminals and the libs will steal your guns
t1_dtth2et	0	*	The irony is strong now that they're turning into a russian puppet state.
t1_dttntkp	1	*	yeah that's what you'd buy at a pharmacy, and what it should cost in a hospital. If you look at a US hospital bill, they will upcharge by multiple times that.
t1_dtuxwm2	0	*	So....is it  we in UK Or you live in Italy?
t1_duj4zcv	0	*	Yeah besides the YEARS you have to wait for an appointment...
t1_dtuyej5	0	*	TIL Koalas are like tiny angry drunk Freddy Kruegers   On that note, is there any cute animal native to Australia that doesn't have the chance of killing/mauling me? 
t1_dttnpcu	1	*	The shitty part of Canadian health care, dental and eyes aren't covered. 
t1_dtthyzm	1	*	I don't have that presumption. In fact I'm more likely to believe that people are motivated by their ego, including myself. Even though we might believe that we are motivated by something more.
t1_dtv56ix	1	*	>wait do I flame him or not? 
t1_duqkz3v	0	*	the point is, it's just common sense.  Russia's enemies admit this and the quora response is pretty detailed as well.  
t1_dup2g7l	1	*	Hell.
t1_duoqpex	0	*	Yeah nah. We aren't a penal colony you know.
t1_durckfi	0	*	Lol its not hard.  The fbi has always been corrupt.  Read a history book.
t1_dupdkmd	0	*	A) You are being comically belligerent B) I used the qualifier mostly when I said it was ignored C) The media failed miserably anyway
t1_duqot82	0	*	good like deciphering that Nicholas cage /U0001f602
t1_dupde9q	1	*	a fuck ton, most likely...
t1_duosbb3	0	*	Walter White seems like the easiest type of person to hide. Shave the goatee, replace the glasses for contacts and give him a wig and he probably looks nothing like himself. 
t1_dupk8vt	0	*	And others insist Wyoming is but a myth that actually does not exist. The place called Wyoming is actually barren and unwatched by God Himself.
t1_duoohvr	1	*	If these were the people involved in the witness protection program, then people definitely died. 
t1_duq9sjc	0	*	You do care, why else would you be jumping to defend it?
t1_duoopbb	1	*	Thank you. I couldnt remember what it reminded me of. Breaking bad!
t1_duq9sns	1	*	good like deciphering that Nicholas cage 
t1_du36mw7	0	*	Where have they applied to work?
t1_du3bkay	1	*	31, why?
t1_du3koua	0	*	Sounds like a UBI for all of the EU would kill multiple birds with one stone then.  It's a pipe dream though.
t1_du4j4ml	0	*	Same way people have been doing it for years.  Watch your budget
t1_dtdkf7m	0	*	Whats it called when Israel bombs hospitals and schools after being warned that where they're targeting contains these places?
t1_dtdxhjz	0	*	I'd argue that the significant gerrymandering seen throughout the EC can be considered part of that establishment; or at least a tool used by it.
t1_dte2f3b	1	*	Really makes you wonder who has the power in this nation. And the worst part is much of the money they have comes from our purchases and our labor. 
t1_dtexxml	1	*	Seriously, what does it matter outside of Russia? Media makes it out of North Korea all the time and no one gives a shit, this is exactly the same.
t1_dtdub3w	0	*	Exactly.  You can become insanely rich in the west without being corrupt. It's hard to do that in countries with corruption that extends all the way down to everyday life.  
t1_dtfvfv2	0	*	Lol the below link shows otherwise   http://www.truth-out.org/news/item/13890-the-second-amendment-was-ratified-to-preserve-slavery
t1_dtdwb5q	0	*	And the laws (or lack thereof) that make legal corruption possible are influenced by the same legal corruption that made the laws. It's a vicious cycle.
t1_dte277d	0	*	This may be the most ironic thing Ive ever read... 
t1_dte22zg	1	*	Ah thanks for the heads up. You'd think I'd know that haha
t1_dtdvczg	0	*	>Trump is a retard  >He is a mastermind planning to destroy the country  Pick one.
t1_dtfz3qy	0	*	How much higher? A percent or two? It can't be much more than US. It's not a lot.  I have no idea what you're going on about murders and hate crimes. I clearly never said that was OK to anyone. 
t1_dtdufnu	1	*	No Patrick, orange is not a politician
t1_dte2cd2	0	*	That's the crazy part! Like in the net neutrality vote some were being paid a couple grand at most, and they still soldout. 
t1_dtenw42	0	*	Citing Kinsey in 2018, LMFAO. The internet exists buddy, use it.
t1_dtdv9ie	0	*	I think it's really more of an American cultural phenomenon relating to your country's deep historical antipathy to government. The internet exists in other countries and did not produce this effect.
t1_dte5o3q	1	*	Wow dude you're like a world record loser congrats
t1_dtdwapp	0	*	How is getting elected President nepotism?
t1_dtduk71	0	*	You can't seriously be implying that Hillary isn't corrupt, right?
t1_dtdv1eb	1	*	Religion.  Anyone without an R next to their name is literally Satan. 
t1_dtdv8pp	1	*	Well those facts would go against the right wing agenda. We can't talk about it
t1_dtdtum6	0	*	You are listing Obamas accomplishments.  Im looking for Trumps.
t1_dte45al	1	*	I have no idea what youre trying to say, but this is really not very good poetry.
t1_dte8vzb	0	*	Ok, I get the Libertarian Left and Authoritarian Right.  But can you ELI5 about the Auth. Left and Lib. Right?
t1_dtehwul	1	*	Some parts are just honest about it. Americans are simply delusional if they think they're in the 20%.
t1_dtdu7dc	1	*	But those emails!!!
t1_dte40au	0	*	https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-sets-5-year-lifetime-lobbying-ban-officials-n713631  I'm sure Obama didn't let Citi bank pick his fucking cabinet... Oh wait... he did.  
t1_dtdz4qo	1	*	He isn't but he certainly panders to those who are.
t1_dtucw4f	1	*	We actually do this, but least isnt in our list of ignored words for some reason. Good catch though, Ill be sure to add it.
t1_dtdznyf	1	*	You only started caring about job gains when you were told to, they've been happening for years.
t1_dte750w	1	*	Number 2...
t1_dtdwaha	0	*	Those are relative terms. When referring to internal US politics, it is relevant.
t1_dted6wh	0	*	Yeah, give me something more than a story from a stranger on reddit.  Is that too much to ask?
t1_dtecway	1	*	Actually his opinion in Heller had him specifically arguing that the 2nd amendment could and should have limits.
t1_dtdujjk	1	*	Dude, it's insane that you would point to the demographics who voted against him by the highest margins.  Black women voted against him like 97-2.
t1_dte0eug	0	*	Your second edit ignores that these things were happening under Obama too. Markets were going up for the last many years. Job growth has actually slowed this year compared to the last 5-6.
t1_dtetxr7	1	*	Yeah. What did you learn how to purify your heart/thoughts from Sam Harris or Jesus or something?
t1_dtdu46e	1	*	> Hillary wasn't corrupt  I'd say she is at least morally corrupt. And I'm far from being a Republican. I could have never voted for either of them.
t1_dte7doy	0	*	Switzerland is pretty good. Having the Canton and Direct Democracy model works pretty well.
t1_dtdtu4o	0	*	All things has inherited from obama.  He can take credit for the boost AFTER the tax plan.  Go back to posting in the_donald we like reality over here.
t1_dte28gx	0	*	Is it not money being exchanged for favorable government decisions? 
t1_dtduo0z	1	*	It really is easy to say trump and his supporters are idiots, I'd wager any scientific tests done on this would back it up.
t1_dte26t2	0	*	Anyone who thinks Democrats and Republicans are the same/similar is obviously ignorant of their respective policy platforms, policy history, and how each vote. 
t1_dtfemxk	1	*	Never said it did. But at least you have the option to change things peacefully. I agree it doesn't mean it will succeed, but it's usually better than not having the option.
t1_dtdualf	1	*	who knew healthcare was so hard? 
t1_dtdzelv	1	*	Someone give this guy gold. Brilliant comment to explain people who obsess about one issue.
t1_dte2wc7	0	*	Not sure why you're trying to change the subject.   https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-sets-5-year-lifetime-lobbying-ban-officials-n713631
t1_dte27i5	0	*	Why? It's money being exchanged for legislation to be passed that favors you. That's bribery in most places. 
t1_dtea5il	0	*	define worked well
t1_dte4y4y	0	*	It happend in 1991
t1_dtduml7	0	*	Trump is part of the elite corruption that people claimed to be sick of 
t1_dte78q6	1	*	I love my dad...  Huh.
t1_dtdz32s	1	*	The more important question these days is why they felt that way. The influence Russia had on our election can not be overstated.
t1_dte0sqw	1	*	Draining the swamp! That way you can see how many actual turds sunk to the bottom to know exactly how much more actual shit you can shovel back in.
t1_dtduw55	0	*	That will surely change their mind. 
t1_dte408n	0	*	Gotcha. Ill check out the links. Anybody know if that is legal to withhold an independent autopsy. That doesnt seem, well, right in any way
t1_dtdwtrp	0	*	sure it is worth fighting, but in enough countries it got out of hand so hard that the people are suffering and will suffer for a long time ..
t1_dtdu3bt	1	*	> No more nepotism!  That's funny because Trump has shown that he is basically the embodiment of nepotism.
t1_dtdyjur	1	*	You just folded up my mind.
t1_dte24rs	0	*	I mean...know it's a pedantic argument. The 1A does not protect you from the law if you threatening violence.  In the eyes of the law, it's already violent. 
t1_dtduvn3	0	*	Legal is not always moral. Sadly.
t1_dte9l95	1	*	Ah a discussion opener, giving us all the choices we never had.
t1_dte38sz	1	*	Like a modern Police Academy movie? would love to see that.
t1_dte5tbd	0	*	Lol you call it a movement then point to an outlier incident that happened years ago
t1_dtduo3x	1	*	I'd rather have voted for a toaster oven that lightly shocks me every day
t1_dtdye5d	1	*	They are too far left. You guys across the pond are just loony
t1_dte261l	1	*	True, I guess it's legal but one could argue it is immoral in terms of how a democracy should function. 
t1_dte3zok	1	*	Uh. Wat? 
t1_dte3v4s	0	*	Yay finally an unbiased response.   [Here's one](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-sets-5-year-lifetime-lobbying-ban-officials-n713631)
t1_dtfu3tb	0	*	Hence the keeping the source of the assassin a secret. Like I've been saying.
t1_dtdxbct	1	*	We can't have a beer with Trump because he doesn't drink.    Which is enough reason to be suspicious of him...
t1_dte12ms	1	*	Lol because there have been 2 Clintons elected into high ranking positions they are a monarchy? I don't think you understand how monarchies work.
t1_dte1hmj	0	*	That's 90% approval from a very biased poll. There are polls out there that say the same thing about Trump.
t1_dtdyu1b	0	*	College educated doesn't mean smart. 
t1_dtdog9e	0	*	God have mercy on me
t1_dte77lj	0	*	Yeah I've had plenty of run-ins with cops, even guns drawn on me. Don't judge.
t1_dtdwcxh	1	*	> It's easy to say that Trump and his voters are idiots. The right wing did the same with Obama and his voters, for example  Le both sides!!!
t1_dtec8l5	1	*	This is the cringiest thing I've seen in a while. 
t1_dtemlmc	0	*	Kinsey's entire body of work has been discredited. You gays champion him as a hero only because he brainwashed you with whacko headjob theories that make you feel invincible.
t1_dtdyub1	1	*	US elections have always been useless, thanks to First Past the Post.
t1_dtdurrg	0	*	Not cheap enough to be bought by the common man, however.
t1_dte34ln	1	*	Somedays I ponder just dropping thousands on a politician just to see what kind of access and clout that I'd be buying. 
t1_dte2wrq	1	*	https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-sets-5-year-lifetime-lobbying-ban-officials-n713631
t1_dte3z1v	0	*	[For starters](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-sets-5-year-lifetime-lobbying-ban-officials-n713631)  This place is as bad an echo chamber as the Donald.
t1_dtduxra	0	*	He pretends to be.
t1_dtdw379	1	*	What is this!? Someone invalidating the beliefs of POCs that voted for Trump as if they can bear a voice, but only if it reinforces that of what they believe?  *What a shocker...*
t1_dte2aey	1	*	True. It's a sad fact indeed 
t1_dsu80hz	0	*	Well not in the grand scheme of things, no, but in this thread at this moment it does as I'm asking about them.
t1_dsofeyf	1	*	Anyone who doesn't see life through racial lenses didn't even notice.
t1_dunpejf	0	*	No now you are messing up whats the split between all those three? Like having a talk with some kids = / = speech  Do you know the official* amount under only speeches and not remarks / comments?
t1_dunpdpc	0	*	Oh, I definitely say the same thing to people when they speak in favor of policies that favor the extremely wealthy. Here's another:  You're either rich or stupid, which is it?
t1_dunrup4	0	*	How many POWs you know gave out secrets willingly? You support those kinds of people? You support traitors?
t1_duntlvk	0	*	Yes that one station was critical...
t1_duou9wk	0	*	Isn't there a litter box you should be cleaning rather than calling me names or have even the cats abandoned you?
t1_dt5qyah	0	*	Anarchists do not only exist under power structures that refrain from killing them. A great many anarchists have died fighting against the brutal regimes they lived under. 
t1_dt4ltly	1	*	Yes, now go back to your fucking clubhouse.
t1_dt4jixm	1	*	No i didnt study pseudo-history where we revise everything that happened. I studied actual history.
t1_dt4h3ec	0	*	Donald Trump supporters isn't an ideological group it is a group of people all connected by the fact they support Donald Trump so Donald Trump's actions and beliefs are pretty f****** relevant
t1_dt4yzmb	0	*	Then stop fucking talking and attempt to think 
t1_dt52c6z	0	*	And *there's* the complaining about SJWs. I'm surprised it took you this long to complain about people trying to redress the balance.
t1_dt4nzzd	1	*	You don't have a point. You have a collection of demonstrably false statements.
t1_duemvxd	0	*	That's some mental gymnastics you're pulling there, all I did was point out that Turkey was in fact a part of Europe unlike you said, not just Asia Minor. I never claimed it was 100% European.
t1_dsvgt3p	0	*	Show me the source for that. 
t1_dsu8z81	0	*	Did you just attempt to justify the Nazis?
t1_dsu65r5	0	*	Might makes right, huh? I'll remember that next time anyone brings up the Holocaust.
t1_dsuc28q	0	*	Lesson well learned from their non-stick carrying days in the mid to late 1930s? Glad that huge negative just led to greater efficiency with their own ethnic cleansing.
t1_dsv2x0l	0	*	The worse thing that could happen to Palestine would be sovereignty.   Then the first rocket attack would be an act of war and Israel could legally shit kick.
t1_dsun3j6	0	*	why don't you go outside, and throw some rocks at people.. see where that gets you.
t1_dsxo64y	0	*	Which is another way of saying you don't have any.
t1_dsv0f9p	1	*	> Do you think Israel want to be in Palestine  No, they want to destroy it bit by bit then take it over and claim it as Israel. 
t1_dsxcsrt	0	*	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Irgun_operations
t1_dsvgw33	1	*	If you really think the Palestinians are resisting then you're terribly mistaken.   If your landlord kills your dog you don't go around killing your neighbors.
t1_dsu741b	0	*	Killing people who invade your land and are stealing it at gunpoint is self defense by any metric.
t1_dsuvxu0	1	*	Yes, something about the 800,000 illegal Israeli settlers flooded across Palestine tells me that Israel wants to be in Palestine. 
t1_dsvdkar	0	*	Why would they?  Theyre foriegn colonists and invaders?   They dont have any rights. None.
t1_dsuw3j0	0	*	Bull. Shit.
t1_dsuysz5	1	*	No country would accept civilians assaulting their soldiers and you know this.  
t1_dszf6e0	0	*	Have you even watched a video? She was not defending, she was attacking to provoke a soldier to do something to her on video. But he didn't. And you're making her a victim somehow... 
t1_dsvgxgx	1	*	They are not resisting anything but biting the hand that feeds them. Meanwhile, they're not resisting those who actually occupy them.
t1_dsuwhxa	1	*	Please read [this](https://newrepublic.com/article/118751/how-israel-palestine-peace-deal-died) and learn yourself some more
t1_dv05op5	0	*	Ok how many butts though 
t1_dv2npv1	0	*	1: this is why they need nukes that reach the USA 2: why would they believe that. The USA did nothing but invasions since 9/11.
t1_dv0c5pn	1	*	Wrong. You can be politically corrected to death. I mean if the Japanese and South Korans realize that you are planning to sacrifice them, why shouldn't they find a better ally, like China? 
t1_dv0hk25	1	*	Those incidents costs a few hundred lives. The Whitehouse invasion was never proved to be theirs.
t1_duhgx2o	1	*	[Poe's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe%27s_law) is a bitch.

t1_dsbozi0	1	*	> Why would they send you to fight China?... American military dosn't pick fights with countries that might thump em back . More likely to invade tibet.  Tibet is occupied by China.
t1_dscxms8	1	*	YES!!!

t1_ds9jm7d	0	*	Hezbollah is nothing like either one, at all.  
t1_ds9gct3	0	*	Terrorists visited a marketplace?  Hmmm...  Trying to kill people with bombs is a horrible idea, I wish people wouldn't do it.

t1_ds9few0	0	*	Wtf does Adelson have to do with U.S. foreign policy? 
t1_dsavit6	0	*	Arab governments don't want to deal with it. Or else they'd open up their borders to them  Also, heeeeyyyyyy budddyyyy
t1_ds9m8fr	1	*	Then iran's protests are everybody's business
t1_ds9knug	0	*	You didnt state both sides are the same you just gave the other side. Using your logic the op said the same thing as you. 
t1_dsgzc5b	0	*	That money was seized for taking US hostages and for the alleged role Hezbollah had in the Beirut Bombings that killed over 200 marines and the fact that the Iranian government supported Hezbollah. 
t1_ds9qdbg	0	*	But what does it do? Other than tell everyone an opinion that they have zero plan on helping come to fruition. It's annoying.
t1_ds9yepc	0	*	There is no world in which Iran could sustain a conflict with the gulf states even absent U.S intervention. They simply dont have the resources. 
t1_ds9kb45	0	*	So much ignorance. Iran is not even Arab. They're Persian. There is no fight against pan Arab nationalism. Pan-arab nationalism was an Egyptian ideology led by gamal abdel nasser and died with him. 
t1_ds9wb9g	0	*	Um. What military goes out looking to fight with countries that might thump em back?   Maybe its just me but, your comment comes off as America is a bully and wont fight someone their own size.   
t1_dsa8lml	1	*	While you were sitting on your couch in  whatever inconsequential country you live in some of us volunteered to make a difference.  Sorry it wasn't perfect enough for you. 
t1_dsads2o	0	*	Either way, they didn't help them. They declared Bin Laden persona non grata in 1993, and al-Qaeda evolved out of an Egypt-based terrorist organization.
t1_ds9g3ag	0	*	Bombing an Israeli embassy, in an attempt to kill Israeli officals.  Just like we do when we drop a bomb on some terrorist hideout and wipe out 3 houses nearby.
t1_ds9icos	0	*	ALL countries are artificially created.  Wars are won and land is taken.  To your second point, as a Floridian I appreciate you supporting me not being ethnically cleansed.
t1_duic2tu	0	*	Cool. You're not going to draw me in, so you may as well find something else to do.
t1_duicdek	0	*	You should read your own posts sometimes but pretend you are a stranger. 
t1_dujj4a3	0	*	It's our choice to do what we want just like how it is the US' to do what they want.  The US didn't force us or manipulate us into voting 'Leave'. If they did, that's interference.
t1_duia58j	1	*	No probs.
t1_dubv75s	1	*	beep beep HI FELLOW BOT ONLY BOTS CAN DOUBT RUSSIAS ALL POWERFUL ONLINE TROLLS beep beep
t1_dta20wc	0	*	Check out comments on the_donald, people say things like this without a hint of irony. Unfortunately, there isn't any way to tell that comment is hyperbolic, simple absurdity isn't enough anymore.  
t1_dv0grmj	0	*	Exactly that. Same one that crashes into Japan's boats
t1_dsxkrgh	0	*	Nitpickers like you are the worst. Illegal was basically implied in the context

t1_dupzrz9	1	*	The U.S cops would beat him to death? I mean yeah that does sound probable. 
t1_dupy2ck	1	*	What did I bring later? A blood label belongs in 1940 Germany. Is that a problem?
t1_dupkdse	0	*	More straw-man? And l think *all* armies cover some faults. Or is your country special?
t1_dupbpr7	1	*	Double post, didn't realise I didn't directly answer your question. 
t1_dupczuq	0	*	Or not caring :) just thirsty for power, money... Very selfish :) 
t1_duq4wpe	1	*	There are horse races and dog races and camel races, but those are events.  What you are describing are breeds, where human beings have selectively bred animals for specific characteristics.
t1_duqht5o	1	*	You are defending a man getting beat to death by multiple soldiers even though there is nothing that has shown he even threw a rock. I just want to point that out to you. 
t1_dsmy7uw	1	*	Those racists. 
t1_dsn8okg	0	*	That actually would help my argument.
t1_dtbwvuc	0	*	>They deny being Brexiteers, knowing it is indefensible  Incorrect. I don't deny it to anyone who asks, and I can defend my position just fine.

t1_dseu5uz	1	*	It's our business if they're not citizens.
t1_dsehg7v	0	*	My concern is that you're trying to fight for 200,000 people who don't understand what the word temporary means. Not exactly the best and brightest.
t1_dsdy0iz	0	*	You shouldnt be able to earn money in one country and give it to another. When money is spent sales tax is accumulated. Every dollar sent away is a dollar that cant be taxed in a sale.
t1_dsey4in	0	*	Nope they should get out now, their temporary status is being REVOKED
t1_dsdsn4y	0	*	Did those jobs not exist before 2002? and you are out of your mind if you think they are all employed and not using welfare. 
t1_dsdwu8g	1	*	Not as though America wasn't originally made great by immigrants or anything. 
t1_dsdv7at	0	*	Autistic semantics games. They take money out of the US economy and send it to another economy. That helps our country 0.
t1_dseayaz	0	*	Imagine that you accepted what you knew was a temporary arrangement, but never sought residency, citizenship, marriage, or anything to solidify your right to remain in this country in 17 years.
t1_dsennua	0	*	Than maybe you should use idiots instead. Sorry, if you mistook that for being wrong.
t1_dsfhbw8	0	*	Should they have come here and just taken our tax dollars until they were sent back?
t1_dsdzubs	1	*	They're here illegally, doesn't matter if they earn their money, its a drain on the system.
t1_dsfnsq0	1	*	They left because their corrupt leader bled shit hole country has zero resources to support itself in times of emergency
t1_dsftg1v	1	*	This is a case by case basis, if these TPS people don't have any other option left then they will have to start packing up and heading back home to their home country and make it great again.
t1_dse2jog	0	*	> I'd let you chill there for a few weeks. Sure, why not?  Because then they establish residency and good luck getting them off of your property! 
t1_dsdwvz5	1	*	Opposing apartheid states = anti-Semitic  K

t1_dsdxvvx	1	*	Hahaha Americans aren't gonna make a single thing great, but you keep fighting the stupid fight, bud.  
t1_dse4lwo	0	*	Doing the right thing at a time of crisis (the earthquake) should not obligate you to support those people in perpetuity. 
t1_dse6u5t	1	*	> by doing jobs Americans wont do  Pretty sure they would do them, if the pay was good enough. 
t1_dsecbmk	1	*	You forget one thing, its not *your* house. You're just a politician, and these houses belong to other people
t1_dsdxo7q	1	*	I don't think they could tell ICE, No don't worry, /u/nacholawbre said I can chill on his lawn.
t1_dsfpzte	1	*	could have, would have, should have.
t1_dsf4h52	1	*	Bouncer is not being a dick if the people he's kicking out are being unruly. Are the 200k Salvadorans are being unruly? None of the articles mentioned that.
t1_dut0cih	1	*	Youre welcome! I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. 
t1_du3atk9	0	*	OK, take the average human, How many times does he get to reproduce? And if he could just pop out offspring every year once he reached puberty? 
t1_du3c5cx	0	*	Apparently it provides enough genetic variation to make the survival of the crayfish a reality.

t1_dt6dnye	0	*	Violence against Nazis and fascists is self-defense though. They openly chant for and try to get genocide enacted.
t1_dt7bb1l	1	*	Same with libertarians and small government folk. It's a all a Utopia. Someone always ends up controlling the resources
t1_dt6h0bj	0	*	That's why I included Judaism.  Many Christians like to pull from the OT anyways to denounce gays, which is why I included Christianity at all. 
t1_dt6b0l2	0	*	Oh, so thats the hair youre gonna split?  Lol, okay, dude.
t1_dt6vgss	0	*	I disagree:  I think that it would be possible if humanity were perfectly selfless and had no criminals or freeloaders or other bad actors.  This also applies to libertarianism or anarchism.
t1_dt77i8t	1	*	I noticed state sanctioned ethnic cleansing wasnt mentioned, so i fail to see how its worse.
t1_dt6prk7	1	*	That's the funny thing about an-coms and an-caps. All the institutions they envision to replace government are essentially pseudo-governments. They just don't like the word.
t1_dt6aqwe	1	*	No, Alanis is in a different castle :(
t1_dt6gfoi	1	*	you know you sound like one those, right?
t1_dt6n799	0	*	If they believing in sewing shut Jane's vagina when they're five (except for a little hole so she can urinate) because God wills it, I don't give a damn.

t1_dt6dttu	0	*	> When the US stopped torturing bad guys were you  1. You have no idea if they actually were bad guys, there never were any trials.  2. You never stopped.
t1_dt6jh0v	0	*	I heard that in the voice of Forrest Gump.
t1_dt67o7v	1	*	Unless you took the extremists of both muslims and Christians to mean most muslims he literally didnt say most muslims hate science
t1_dt6jjy6	0	*	What's the most tolerant muslim country to you then? 
t1_dt7kcyc	1	*	Real estate mostly Id imagine.  
t1_dt6779q	0	*	Where did I say most Muslims hate science, quote me
t1_dt6chg7	1	*	Yeah, right. The anarchists of the antifa have been mocking liberals for decades. 
t1_dt6otib	1	*	There'd likely be a thug caste of party members to beat and rob you if you manage to achieve any degree of prosperity.
t1_dt6clrv	1	*	Neo-Nazis = Neo-fascists, but specific to the Nazi variant of fascism. 
t1_dtc3enl	1	*	Yeah I was implying that they get killed instead of just getting kicked out of Home 
t1_dt6dwi7	0	*	If, in your eyes, someone that advocates literal genocide is the better person that the one that punches them, I dont know what to tell you.
t1_dt6mmuf	0	*	Difference between anarchism's dictionary and philosophical definitions. The philosophy is very different from the what you see in the dictionary.
t1_dt61yp2	0	*	Hatred only feeds hatred, just as rasism and terrorism thrives of eachother. 
t1_dt65mrz	1	*	What are you talking about? I'm merely commenting on the fact that it is absurd to think harm could be perceived positive. It's 100% not about this certain man.
t1_dt7dw2u	1	*	From the institutionalized thieves that landlords are, to the entirery of the human race.
t1_dt67jmv	0	*	Except Jews...oh and Christians...oh and apostates...etc 
t1_dt64zsh	1	*	Is it? Didnt many communist uprisings kill many people for their religious beliefs?   And then there were the crusades, so I know youre not saying anti-theists are the only bad guys.
t1_dt81e9h	1	*	Sometimes I need a gentle reminder, and there have only been a few impact grenade incidents 
t1_dus6nob	1	*	At first I was mad for your implication that the US is not a developed country... but then I thought about it. We need serious change. 
t1_dulw1it	0	*	You have a good Dad.

t1_dum7fp5	0	*	thats a lot of words to say no.
t1_dum0mgx	0	*	lol. I think you misunderstood the question of the other commentator. Everyone knows that Iran wants to destroy Israel.

t1_dtnfwty	0	*	You literally said Canada is in a pretty shitty situation. How so?
t1_dsgjghr	1	*	And this is why we check usernames lol, we've all done this at some point
t1_dsgfheu	1	*	Thanks lol, I was worried it would get buried.
t1_dsgcjsu	0	*	Ok, it just seems to contradict what you said first.
t1_dshq2l0	0	*	Yea, id post it but if it were to go viral that would bring on negative consequences for me. 
t1_dun4jm7	0	*	So just like the French ?
t1_duo4dn8	1	*	perhaps they're just interested in the resource generally given the demand for it.
t1_dup3tpt	1	*	USA is not a democracy?
t1_dundftu	1	*	Yup, they keep a high level of connection. And influence. It's an interventionist bloc essentially. Except France isnt pushing overly hard aside from economic and some political aspects. 
t1_dumc4ps	1	*	You are making it harder to him.
t1_dsgjew3	1	*	For example: HAVE A BABY IN THE UNITED STATES. The kid is an automatic citiizen due to a BS judge in the '80s, so guess who pays for the kid? The government. Tada! 
t1_dsgdyxa	0	*	You sir, are a fucking moron.    That is all.
t1_dsgpdvv	0	*	And you're a California pothead.  Are we even now?  Look, he's a truck driver!  OBVIOUSLY he's uneducated!  You're the reason Trump is in the goddamn whitehouse so thanks for that.

t1_dsgd89y	0	*	Mexico
t1_du1ptkq	1	*	true. some subs are really good. the front page is as mindless as FB / IG feed. nothing's wrong with that as long as we don't mistake entertainment for learning.
t1_du1n851	1	*	Ah, for a smaller group I could see how it's possible fair enough.  
t1_du1sjon	0	*	Older people on the internet? I know 13 yr olds who know what blue waffle is, and makes sense with the ban. It's not food related.
t1_du1h0hj	0	*	so why cant you make them blue? 
t1_du1rr2j	0	*	Youtube also makes your case for you. When they adapted google plus for the comments, you could only +1 for a while and the thumbs down button does nothing. Now its a circus.
t1_du1wsj3	1	*	It's a common saying about twitter. Obviously their demographic is younger.
t1_du20pjf	1	*	Thank you,I will try to see what happens when I use it!

t1_duj1m9y	0	*	Not surprising. Aussies are involved in all of US's wars, illegal or not. 
t1_duj86n4	1	*	You're right, they wont.  Which makes Abes push for an offensive military just so scary. 
t1_duikoah	1	*	Yeah, but its more about Japans refusal to own their involvement in the issues.    
t1_dtl6lds	0	*	Do you compare Ottomans or modern Turkey to Nazi Germany?
t1_dt0ju94	1	*	No, he didn't become that way until he began taking medication, and yes ADHD is hard to treat without medication but worth trying before putting their kids on damaging pills.
t1_dszc5x7	1	*	No one is claiming any medical effects here though.
t1_dsznam1	0	*	This may be true. But they certainly have no problem medicating  females as well. Around 1 in 4 will be on anti depressants by the time they turn 40.

t1_dv0sc71	0	*	Yes
t1_dv0pyfn	0	*	Much less organized terrorist groups.
t1_dv0kh49	0	*	That doesnt cause them to be terrorists, they choose to become terrorists because they are violent assholes

t1_duy7ru9	1	*	I responded to you in another chain and still not in prison. I even think that you intentionally spread lies. Why?
t1_duy7ejf	0	*	I mean, we don't think Putin is literally Hitler or Stalin, but we understand Putin and Trump are both as close we've come, since.
t1_duxnir6	0	*	Actually, it is.

t1_duxy2d6	1	*	That sounds pretty goddamn punk rock too!
t1_duya5lb	1	*	It's a private trial, not a military one. That's not true. 
t1_duxy4z5	0	*	That's not remotely close to what r/madlads is about. I give up
t1_duye6gl	1	*	If true, what's your point? I'm not like Trumpsters, who live in a black and white world. I can like people for some things and still dislike other things about the same people.
t1_duxztrp	1	*	I mean, being a little... *weird* is most of what separates punk from other anti-authoritarian subcultures.
t1_duxzrxb	1	*	True but it's time we start convincing them of the difference. This country is in need of real patriots now more than it has been in most of our lifetimes. 
t1_duy6bs4	0	*	I agree. But there are plenty of better countries than the US.
t1_duxzgs3	0	*	Yes it is. All expression of being gay is covered under the gay propaganda law.

t1_duwbjyc	1	*	I have gone with the idea that you can judge the humanity of a religion by looking at what happens when a particular one has a huge majority.  None but the Jains seem to be really peaceful. 
t1_duug2pv	0	*	They put in some period (36 months, I believe) between pregnancies.
t1_dud454x	1	*	I hardly consider joining another countries civil war against rebels as a mercenary a decent and proud living. Also attacking US backed oil pipeline is probably not the best idea.

t1_dtxboo4	0	*	is there any reason to think China might fire on Japan or SK? Or others might fire on them?

t1_dt71k8z	1	*	Yes it does.  It only defends women against men.   There is no reason any broad law like that should apply to only one gender.

t1_dskd8f3	0	*	No, everyone has a right to a healthy life. That means they can live like that if they wish. If they don't, society is not responsible for their poor productivity and lack of effort.

t1_dshl0zy	1	*	10-12 at one time.. Most Tims are open for more than one shift

t1_dsh14bi	0	*	Ok.  I read that the Hortons were bought out.  I didn't know they married back in.  My bad.
t1_dshjsrm	0	*	Increasing minimum wage just increases the amount of income one needs to get out of poverty. It will increase inflation and in effect the government gets paid more tax.
t1_dsh7dgw	1	*	I understand! Just happened to coincide with my own observation the other day, which is hardly scientific, but it left me a little bummed out nonetheless.

t1_dsh7g25	1	*	Almost. For all I know, McD's is empty the rest of the day. BUT this wasn't even peak lunch hour. So I'm disappointed that it's apparently still thriving.
t1_dsgxqdd	0	*	There was a thread bout half a week ago where Horton's dropped their supplier and McD picked it up, that's probably what everyone is remembering

t1_dshtba3	0	*	>  $3 * 24hrs * 10 = $720 per day * 365 = $262,800.  I believe your adjustment in the hourly figure, but no Tim Horton's anywhere is staffing 10 employees at 3 am.

t1_dsh9mzy	0	*	This guy Rich Dad Poor Dads.
t1_dshlh7i	1	*	If we go by the rate of inflation it'd rqual about 300k. Unfortunately we really dont have access to better info and can only use what info we do have to make our best estimates. 
t1_dsi6djc	1	*	Debatable... 
t1_dsi1ydm	1	*	Fair enough.
t1_dsh0zt8	0	*	If its a family, why is only 1 person working? Obviously a single income on minimum wage isn't going to raise a family.
t1_dshaeil	1	*	Worked for kings and dukes for centuries. They owned all the land and could rent it out for serfs to work/live on. Just watch out for a communist revolution. 
t1_dshd93m	1	*	I don't think their reputation globally is as bad as domestic, and since everything is standardized, it might be safer to stick with the old marketing sctick.
t1_dsh2q7x	1	*	Lol that's because they don't have breaks to cut. McDonald's only gives paid breaks where required to by law. Same with benefits.
t1_dsguzee	0	*	It's a fair view, and it's the view that's allowed humanity to advance so rapidly the last 300 years.

t1_dsh988k	1	*	One of our local Kmarts just closed recently and I thought the exact same thing about their liquidation prices.
t1_dsh5xcj	0	*	Non-franchise places that can set their own prices to offset the increase?

t1_dt8gxsw	0	*	Arkansas.
t1_dt7zl5z	0	*	No it's perversion and a monstrocity which hurts millions of children worldwide. Pedo apologists are standing on the grave of all the murdered children by child abusers. 
t1_dt8yemq	1	*	No. Luke the Fisher deliberately misrepresents people out of habit. When he lacks the mental power to argue against what people are saying, he caricatures their remarks.
t1_dtfkdqi	0	*	Anyway, of course it existed, and the term Polish extermination camp refers to the place where it was located: Poland. Nothing more, nothing less.

t1_ds5uid5	1	*	I said it would be worse if we mishandled paper... But we don't... And we don't have to mishandle plastic.  It's just that we chose to do so because nobody thinks it's that big of a problem.

t1_duo8ezh	1	*	Lol, if you read any of the other person's comments you'd realize they're a bias Russian supporter out to only discuss negative actions of the US while ignoring all other parties. 
t1_duo5e0b	1	*	The US bombed Mosul and Raqqa to get rid of IS. The Syrian Government is bombing Ghouta to remove al-qaeda. Bombs fall in wars and civilians die, which is why war is such a bad thing
t1_du80kcd	1	*	Why? wouldnt photos be enough? If things are so cut and dry, what are we missing? 
t1_dsly55e	1	*	Nah man, he said he's a white dude. Only those got-dang immigrants (and black people) are on government assistance. Honestly. (/s for safety)

t1_dslxa0y	0	*	He doesnt do it pointlessly, he's saying exactly what a lot of people have been thinking all these years which I find pretty awesome
t1_dsm4etc	0	*	Actually it is. But these kind of conversations don't appear in the media or internet headlines so you read only about the ones which are not normal.
t1_dsmccv9	0	*	That's fair, there's tons of better reasons to criticize Trump. I was just making a quick comment on how Trump isn't really doing his job, and didn't mean that much with it, but still, fair is fair. 
t1_dslvri3	0	*	So I'm not allowed to ask anyone who isn't white where they're from, because apparently that means I'm assuming they're from a different country?  Do you really not see how stupid your comment is...

t1_dslxk9d	0	*	So the complaints are all about presentation? 
t1_dsm4byt	1	*	Depends where they're from. There are lots of Chinese background people in Australia but a large proportion speak Cantonese and identify as coming from Hong Kong rather than just China. 
t1_dslwg4n	1	*	Services like ancestry.com and 23andMe are wildly popular because Americans care about bloodlines.  It is topical.  
t1_dsm9hd3	1	*	I'm sorry people make you feel that way fam!  We need to meet these things with love and education if we want America to be a better place.

t1_dslvfms	1	*	Fair, thank you.
t1_dsm0qij	1	*	Because, 'previously slave American' is not a fun term. People who can identify what country they came from generally identify as such (Nigerian-American) or simply black.

t1_dso4dxf	1	*	No. It would be hard for me to be more white. Norwegian, German, English with just a splash of Irish somewhere back there. She's actually just a little peculiar and has very few boundaries.
t1_dsm8lea	0	*	Lol my dad was army. I was born abroad and have lived in several places in the south of England. I just sound like a posh git, but my grandparents are from Glasgow and Dartford so I'm anything but.

t1_dsn3j8j	1	*	I don't think you've considered that China or Russia would soon fill the role of lone superpower and world police, and life under their global rule could be much worse.
t1_dsmj0gx	0	*	I mean, from a white males perspective, I'm pretty sure if I say either it will be assumed I am racist.

t1_dsm2iad	0	*	I mean, I'm just letting you know so you don't offend other people in the future unintentionally.  You can double down and be rude too, I guess.
t1_dsm5roh	1	*	Trump could learn to approach the situation differently rather than sounding like a piece of shit racist.
t1_dslz7p1	0	*	And if I recall correctly, she wasn't specifically trying to prove that they weren't anti-Semitic, she was proving that they weren't bigots. 
t1_dslze3f	0	*	Awe well I learned now. I supposed it was as mentioning that you would tip had you had anything to tip. Its the thought that counts.

t1_dslyv7q	1	*	This is such a great explanation, thank you. :) Now Ill know how to explain to others why Ive been uncomfortable when people ask me where I REALLY am from.
t1_dslzn1r	0	*	Stop following up with Where are you really from?  
t1_dsmlbm5	1	*	Yes and look at what your original comment was replying to, someone just asking a polite way to get to know someone more. Why are you shitting on him for it?
t1_dsm30d2	0	*	Wait, the physical Purple Heart medals given out since the Second World War all date to 1945? We have them in storage somewhere ready to distribute?
t1_dsm7guj	0	*	That's exactly why it isn't rude. 
t1_dsm784o	1	*	And you're doing the same? 
t1_dsly3qw	1	*	Well listen, you have little hands so you can't be King, but you can be President. 
t1_dsm1auf	0	*	So in your view, entertainment is no different from news?  God, how twisted has your outlook on being informed has become when, you cannot see the difference from both.
t1_dsmb3el	1	*	Reddit is ridiculous and so are you
t1_dsm0x4a	1	*	Then saying my nationality is American should end the conversation. People are in fact asking about ethnicity when they are asking where I'm from.
t1_dsm8z5p	0	*	Er, I know. That was the joke. 
t1_dsmnfpn	0	*	The right way is to not treat us like foreigners. Don't insist in asking where we CAME FROM. You can ask for our ethnicity or heritage.  
t1_dsm7m0i	1	*	> good counter argument  There's no counter argument because there was no argument to begin with, only an extremely poor understanding of the circumstances that led to your predicament on your part.

t1_dt2jlfk	0	*	It certainly doesnt help, but thats hardly the main source of suffering for Gazans. Like breaking a toe when you have liver cancer.

t1_dudyrxt	1	*	Oh wow, I have a drawer full of that stuff which I'm not even using.
t1_duebk9i	1	*	I guess the issue is more in line with Capitalism which ought to push competition and patent laws actively preventing it.
t1_duebll3	0	*	I guess it's the patent laws that need revising then. As they are the main reason competition can't exist in some fields.
t1_dududds	1	*	Because he doesnt know how an expense account works.   It works by paying for things, not tips.

t1_due3ar6	1	*	Wu Tang is here forever, motherf**kers
t1_dueca9m	1	*	They will. One of the biggest obstacles is the federal funding component, for sure. No way this administration and Congress will allow it.  It'll take time, but it will happen.

t1_duds8nx	1	*	Australian Comcast.
t1_duej252	0	*	This article, like my post, is about an instance where these regulations failed, allowing capitalism to operate naturally, in this instance. This is an instance of capitalism functioning as intended.

t1_duecgrt	1	*	Yup. It was a typo.
t1_due362j	1	*	Fair enough. Guess a better description of what I'm talking about is an unregulated market. 
t1_dudvihs	1	*	Public Broadcasting Service, the public broadcasting network.   So not necessarily wrong, just a weird way of saying it.
t1_dudsx2l	0	*	What? Creationism is one of the main points of Christianity.  Literally the first verse of the entire Bible is In the beginning, God created the heavens and the Earth.
t1_dudsf07	1	*	Not these ones.
t1_dueaua1	1	*	> They use it also for girls that feels that the sex is painfull.   Woah, but that reminds me of the time I bought extended pleasure condoms with benzocaine, horrible stuff. 
t1_duea2lx	0	*	Well with Assad coming from a medical background, it makes sense that he would find a way to at least make that aspect of life decent for those under his dictatorship.
t1_dudrurg	0	*	I vote conservative because I see that helping more than liberal politicians. I hold some liberal views but I feel like conservatism helps the country more 
t1_dudxygd	1	*	People with a knowledge of healthcare and biochemistry usually are. Doctors don't like it when someone knows of a condition or drug they've never heard of (or so I've noticed).
t1_dueywpc	1	*	I mean ive taken Micro, Macro, Intermediate Micro, and International Trade 340 and 440, but yeah everything aside from free market economics is impossible.
t1_duduou0	1	*	Yeah that's just silly. Everyone knows it stands for Peanut Butter Sammich.
t1_due2ec7	1	*	I don't know what country you're from but I recommend doing some research into how our system works. It might help you develop a more nuanced understanding of our screwed up system.
t1_dudrcfg	0	*	>Government intervention in a market automatically disqualifies it from being capitalism.  Yeah no. That's not even close to bring true.
t1_duegote	1	*	Not my doctor, just a doctor i heard on the radio
t1_duen8gh	1	*	I'm not trolling anyone. The people on this board have hair in their arses about big pharma and the USA that is based in pure ignorance.
t1_dudu1gj	1	*	Unfortunately it doesnt have to have a real purpose besides bringing in profits to become patented.
t1_due76i3	1	*	Thats the case in a lot of shitholes that actually have infrastructure. They charge what the market will bear. 
t1_dudsa2d	0	*	Probably because there is a cheaper version that does the same thing.
t1_dudxis8	0	*	You can also grow your own food if things became that desperate.   You can't grow your own drugs, well, one you can, but big pharma has already made that illegal. 
t1_dued0ss	1	*	I'm skeptical that you can't make that work, but I think this is the point where the conversation gets too complicated for a casual internet conversation. 
t1_dudwwvl	1	*	He's right. The part he's referring to that's hard is the coating. He's saying you can't crack it open to extract the drug all At once.
t1_dudwcll	0	*	TIL that the official language of Nigeria is English.

t1_dudvd7s	0	*	Just the US. Rest of the Americas is pretty cool
t1_dudv25y	0	*	Try collusion instead of collision 
t1_due3p1w	1	*	Just seems more costly and less less effective than coating tiny balls in a waxy hard to digest coating like some ER oxycodones 
t1_dudumn2	0	*	Am I wrong? How can the UK government socialist their way to buying cheap drugs from the US exactly?
t1_due060r	1	*	Exactly. The whole system is a mess
t1_dudr8r5	0	*	You can clearly didn't read what and as a Master you sure can't discuss two things. Sure. Absolutely. Cool story bro. So what market again had no government intervention... Oh yeah non.  
t1_dudsbxm	1	*	He meant 700 billion.
t1_dudztao	1	*	There wouldn't be any drugs to make cheaper. Who in their right mind would bother spending billions if they knew that they wouldn't get it back. 
t1_dudrqg4	0	*	Fucking Telstra
t1_dudvacr	1	*	Damn dude. Might be harder to find one than you think. Most homeless dudes around here would probably stab you in the face if you suggested that. But I guess if you could find one...

t1_dulfms3	1	*	He's obviously a Russian troll
t1_dume4b2	1	*	Disagree. There's been a very clear surge in complete bullshit from every angle since he got into office. 
t1_dulkge9	0	*	So you can't point any that I hold. Cool. I feel the wind from the goalposts moving.  But what extreme views are highly up voted on Kia? Have any examples of that?
t1_duln09h	0	*	Thats because there isnt reverse racism there is simply racism and it can happen to people of any colour, including whites
t1_dulqbbg	0	*	Reread the comment. I said they instigated it and the extremist latched on. 
t1_duljx4q	0	*	I can't tell if this is satire or real. I don't know what to trust anymore as real or troll.
t1_dulnb7s	0	*	> any attack on athletes peaceful protest is either an extreme bad faith argument or poorly veiled bigotry.  Ha! Youre doing it right now! You guys literally cant help yourselves!
t1_dulwgga	1	*	Maybe if liberals need their hearing checked if all they seem to hear are dog-whistles.  Someone else's perception issues are not my responsibility to fix.
t1_dulfwg6	1	*	thats not true. the right had been up there making fiction real like gods. the dems are just out of their league.  its not a contest. even if it was the repubs are just ridiculously better.
t1_dul31lq	0	*	I don't care about your day and your anecdotal evidence means nothing.
t1_duljou5	0	*	I think the point they're making that instead of getting a response like you just gave with a thoughtful argument, he simply gets called names.
t1_dulcvbo	1	*	Just a shitty troll or a truly idiotic person. Ignore and let them rattle their crappy opinion.
t1_dum3yf6	1	*	I don't think Trump got elected on the basis of a single subreddit, and I don't think the people on that sub are actually representative of the people who voted Trump who have never heard of a reddit.
t1_dulk3f7	1	*	What a ridiculous statement.
t1_dulpnaw	1	*	I agree that it is total propaganda. The NRA sucks.  But it doesn't make you any less of a tool
t1_duobuhh	1	*	Well the welfare system was voted in and then it lead to some unintended consequences. That happened because of the way supply and demand effect the motivations of people. 
t1_dulgnse	0	*	 Yeah, and the US is totally not a shit hole with a bully as leader also.

t1_dt72xz0	1	*	You're right, I am arguing semantics. So the fuck what? And the definition of goalpost is as follows:  >lpst >noun >either of the two upright posts of a goal.  Sorry, you're the one who's wrong.

t1_dsw7hg2	1	*	Yeah honestly on second thought, I do agree with you. Even the most preposterous points should be shot down with facts.
t1_dstr4ng	1	*	The article clearly shows nothing. He said specifically that the US is the global security/military solution to conflicts, and you posted an article about NATO sabre rattling. 
t1_dsslnik	0	*	That's a weird time traveling strawman.
t1_dsstiet	1	*	More like Russia attacking Turkey because their only access out of the black sea is in Turkish waters.   Can you see the difference?

t1_dtbfhbr	0	*	You are a literal Nazi, you should be ashamed of yourself.
t1_dtcufe6	1	*	Lol I advise that you talk to some Mizrahi Jews and see what they have to say about it. They had everything stolen from them and were brutally mistreated. There's no way around that. 
t1_dtbsept	1	*	You have it the other way around. Arab jews left to Israel while the Palestinians were expelled.
t1_dtc7dn1	0	*	Seeking asylum IS NOT the same as Immigration.  You can learn about it here. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refugee  
t1_dtb6q18	0	*	But they're importing vast amounts of laborers legally. Diluting the labor pool and reducing national unity are explicit goals of pro-mass-immigration individuals like Soros.
t1_dtbh45h	0	*	And the topic of the news article represents a threat to your nation and people? Don't make me laugh. Don't drag the Jewish past through the dirt for your irrational bigotry.

t1_dtdr5nh	0	*	It's not supposed to be easy.

t1_dsqcqg0	0	*	Well you can live in your ideological world and ill live in the real world. 
t1_dsqe540	0	*	Yeah, it was implied. They said how the fuck is that not doxxing as if doxxing is a punishable offence

t1_dsqdwmn	0	*	When you have stupid laws dont blame it on people taking advantage of them.

t1_dsqk33v	1	*	Yeah I'm a little suspicious of this now
t1_dsq5rco	1	*	>You literally said there is no such thing as a fake death threat.  What if I told you that it's still possible to conceptualize things that don't exist? 
t1_dsqgc4u	0	*	Are you saying that judges, cops, lawyers, etc. actually use law as their personal moral compass even when they know they won't be found out?
t1_dsq6utd	0	*	so are you saying the only way a law can be racist is if it explicitly said black people?
t1_dsq6yjv	1	*	yeah, thats a good point. my arguement is that it is also a thing specific to our time, it has no historic basis.
t1_dsrw5a8	1	*	His father put it together in an attempt to garner sympathy points from the public.

t1_dsqa9bd	0	*	Your argument sounds like butthurt. 
t1_dsr2t9r	1	*	I know what you are saying but I think it needs to be said more clearly, because there is such a blurry line between empathizing and shutting down people who question the event.

t1_dsq4jun	1	*	It's a good argument if you actually want to listen to brown people and care about their life experiences... but if you just want to shove the problem of racism under the rug, well...
t1_dsqp4sn	1	*	Ok fine, maybe she's a dickbag but I'm just saying that something someone was put in against their will doesn't necessarily mean they can't be a champion for others.  Does that make sense?
t1_dsqgj9m	0	*	Pretty European too.
t1_dsqeeae	1	*	I don't think the occasional false report undermines the validity of all the others. It only undermines the validity of that single false report.  Cheers.

t1_dstv1kj	0	*	No, the police simply said the attack didn't happen. The part where you're assuming this was a grand evil conspiracy by an 11-year-old is where the crazy comes in.

t1_dspzc3j	1	*	Sounds like the police did not charge the 11-yr-old. Does that mean the police supports lying?
t1_dsqwi87	0	*	Yes actually. Oftentimes it's the most conservative parents who find issues with this 
t1_dsqjsmm	0	*	I agree that is the case, but if honeslty think it's exclusive to black communitues, you should take a drive through Appalachia 
t1_dsr0f6o	1	*	Hey man, chill out and jerk off to some hentai... Relax! 
t1_dsq524r	0	*	Actually, some guy cutting off a hijab is something that the police should be able to handle, and hot takes from politicians are really not necessary.

t1_dsq83dy	1	*	Something like this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink  In all fairness though, its actually the journalists who are pushing groupthink. Consumers merely fall for it. Or dont. 
t1_dsqgn87	0	*	Yes, that is not in contention. He took a clock apart and stuck the parts in a pencil case. But what he also did not do is add any other components to attempt to make it look more like a bomb.

t1_dt1lqr5	1	*	What the fuck?
t1_dt17052	0	*	I'm not disagreeing with your sentiment, just your inability to admit you are wrong.  Just saying that you used the wrong word doesn't make your point invalid.

t1_dt4ktcs	1	*	Or congressional districts independent of state boundaries so you can bundle mini-states together.  They already get senate seats to represent the states.

t1_dt1bh4c	0	*	It's about how China is using the shutdown to attack the legitimacy of US democracy. i.e., your government sucks.  People in this thread be like no, *your* government sucks.

t1_dt1cxz6	0	*	Dude, I get your point, but this is not the same as China coming right out and grabbing up people who write against the government, and throwing them in jail. You can see the difference, I know.
t1_dt17hkf	1	*	Sadly they weren't 
t1_dt1ik5s	1	*	Term limits are to prevent malicious actors from consolidating permanent power. If anything, I would expect a studied expert in a field of experts to know how to assemble and keep power forever.

t1_dv1vu16	1	*	Yes! It is the typical thing we all discover when working at law firms. Everything is black or white if you explain it nicely  And yes, that test is easy (Spain is the easiest in europe). Thank you!
t1_dv21hcd	0	*	Once again, failed to provide any reasoning and trying to sway off topic by throwing insults. Typical sign of a sore loser.

t1_ds6ml2r	0	*	Why what?  I am not saying anything about ethnicity either way.  It could be correlated, sure, but it's not necessary that it be.
t1_duo1ri0	0	*	Since when was not getting shot in school a partisan issue.   If you are willing to take stupid fucking opinions then logic is suddenly partisan. That isn't a criticism of logic.

t1_duh62py	1	*	Does anyone in an american prison want to shank him? I mean I guess some russians could pay off another US inmate to do it for them. But I don't think the motive exists by itself inside a US prison.
t1_duh1sa4	0	*	I seem to remember this coming up in a thread before, and that's there's precedent that accepting a pardon is not an admission of guilt, legally speaking. I have no idea if that's true or not.

t1_dtf9a81	0	*	Some AMD processors are affected, but it appears the fault is entirely Intel's. It's their microcode that affects certain x86_64 CPUs.

t1_duhv0r9	0	*	More to a country than an economy? That's the most important thing though. What else is in such decay? The only I notice is that a lot of people on the left hate the country now and want it to fail.

t1_duhwcwm	0	*	If it's heavily regulated at the cost for consumers, how come so many Americans get billed tens of thousands of dollars for barely 24 hours in a hospital? 
t1_duhmcuu	1	*	Did you just assume that aliens can't be Egyptian?

t1_duhuo5s	1	*	Not even sure if he read the article tbh.
t1_duhrbaf	1	*	Not necessarily.  Earth could end up like Venus if the greenhouse effect becomes too extreme.  A runaway greenhouse effect would destroy all life on this planet.
t1_duhomjh	1	*	That sounds pretty inefficient if that's what it's limited to.
t1_duhujw2	1	*	Well the freeze thaw cycle in Europe would destroy the pyramids. Also the pyramids in Central America are much much younger.
t1_duhsds7	1	*	Can you in any way prove that the US is the worst? The US is huge so basing this off a one city example is hardly fair

t1_dshu0fk	0	*	> the fuck it matters for a chat bot  It matters everything.  > excellent advice, follow it.  I don't have to, I actually know what I'm talking about. Now, answer my question. What languages?
t1_dshyxlp	1	*	No worries mate. These political discussions are easily heated. I appreciate your response :)
t1_dshoy3r	0	*	In addition, it's OK to ban an apple farmer who's secretly pretending to be a random guy on the street that prefers apples to oranges so that he can improve his own sale. 
t1_du1o0c9	0	*	Not only that, but I'm pretty sure that most delivery systems that currently exist involve *multiple* warheads inside a single missile.
t1_du1kutb	0	*	What do you think they will do with the ICBM? Nuke the United States offensively? Don't be naive this is for deterrence, they don't wanna end up like Saddam and Gaddafi. 
t1_du1aogx	1	*	Will get back to you on it, but their constitution was rewritten after the Irish rebellion IIRC.  And they have a totally different government than the Norman one.
t1_du1hp5x	0	*	You're kind of making some serious leaps in logic here about things you can't and don't know. 
t1_du1kxry	1	*	Not really, can you give me any examples of U.S. sanctions, which China and Russia mostly ignore anyway, influencing North Koreas behaviour? 
t1_du1b6gm	0	*	What vpn has access to NK?
t1_du1gxbg	0	*	You are severely naive.
t1_du34o9v	1	*	Oh is actually a very interesting way of putting it. 
t1_du225pt	1	*	They don't need a ICBM, they only need to nuke their neighbors.   That's deterrent enough.
t1_du1z78d	0	*	What's the age of conscription in shit-hole countries again?
t1_du1nwyx	0	*	An imgur link with some kindergarten annotations.  We are done here.
t1_dtkeo87	1	*	Shut up

t1_dsrjgxp	1	*	Not really.
t1_dsshynh	1	*	Both would suffocate.
t1_dsrggf4	1	*	Turns out being a warmongering country means some countries become less safe for your citizens.
t1_dsrunkg	1	*	In a vacuum  both countries would fall at the same speed, too. But that's mot relevant either.
t1_dsrpqar	1	*	Except we're not living in a vacuum. So that is completely irrelevant.
t1_dsd7c11	0	*	Youre missing my point, but oke. 
t1_dtvqsig	0	*	What do you mean? Im being just as ignorant as you are my child.

t1_du0pu1i	1	*	No worries buddy, have a great weekend
t1_dutuetg	0	*	Ok.  That's fine.  But to take that argument, you're *also* in support of how efficient Hitler and Stalin were.  Is that *really* the argument that you're making?  You can't have it both ways.
t1_duqbkjk	0	*	who's saying food and shelter isn't important? there are things called food banks and affordable housing in the US you know.
t1_duq4flp	1	*	Well best of luck to the Chinese people. I suppose we all sacrifice some freedom for security and stability.
t1_dupu28a	0	*	Do you know how many tests happened in the 50s and 60s?
t1_durxnys	0	*	Exactly what it says, a right to do something is, by definition, a right. Whether or not it is good or should be afforded to people is another discussion.
t1_dv07u88	0	*	So yes, you are going to defend a gun over a kid's life. People like you are why this happens in this shithole of a country. 
t1_dv0gzw7	0	*	> For us, thanking a serviceman is a simple display of respect, similar to thanking a policeman or fireman.  as I said its creepy as fuck to someone who isn't from the USA
t1_dv0i5ky	1	*	Exactly. So why didnt he? I already explained it.
t1_dv0ghsh	1	*	I don't see ISIS fighting at all because they are practically wiped out now...
t1_dt31y4d	1	*	How much oil did those kids have on them.  Canada was involved in Libya and Nicaragua? 
t1_dt31zt1	1	*	I'm not even American either. I just think that saving children is nice.
t1_dspsf22	0	*	well then they damned well shouldn't be calling it the Vatican Observatory, monks or no.
t1_dt2b72m	0	*	They are, they recognize the nation. Which was a big deal, then the goalpost is just moved back to as a jewish state, something they have an issue with due to a sizeable non jewish part of Israeli's. 
t1_dt2osej	0	*	Most Israeli PMs go down for some combination of those things because of how Israeli laws work. But yeah, it seems a little sketchy overall despite it being the best offer.
t1_dsg3h40	0	*	There's been various chatter about 100 hour work weeks in the navy. Mccain even commented on it.
t1_dsgqhkh	0	*	what? why would they want WHOLE Ukraine? Crimea is important military object
t1_dsg6tva	1	*	Issue is, no heavy sanctions were really leveled. Not from the US, and definitely not from the EU.
t1_dsgeq1h	1	*	It happens all the time, nobody cares.
t1_dsfeyi6	0	*	Wait, have we found Trumps reddit account? 
t1_dsfkpk8	1	*	When that happens? It happens all time and no one gives a fuck.
t1_dsfnp2q	0	*	Of course Ukraine asked.... It isn't like the US Navy ships can dock there without permission. 
t1_dsftim6	0	*	Can't be too sure, I had an argument with someone on a previous account who seemed to think that US ships was incapable of running of the GPS was altered and this was literally the begining of WW3.
t1_dsfhv2x	0	*	While I agree there would be rhetoric, that's largely all that would happen. At most, we might try to implement a sanction of some sort.
t1_dsg2ngy	1	*	That's what I meant to say, my point being that it's most likely human error as opposed to instrument failure.
t1_dsh2mes	1	*	Thanks, I'll try that.
t1_dtgqq5y	1	*	I've only stated facts here. Let's try to stick with that my friend.
t1_dszwudj	0	*	I was certain it was for violating chickens or something....
t1_dt00tp8	0	*	Is that why gamma rays are more deadly?   Needing two feet of lead between you and the radioactive material?  Is it two inches of lead for beta rays?

t1_dt002mk	0	*	Just sayin' that pros can disable security systems (not like in the movies). A strong magnet will fake that a door is still closed.
t1_dt0ia8i	0	*	That game was invented during the Great Depression.  Its called monopoly.  If you played it, you know how it ends.
t1_dt0487p	0	*	Fuck OnStar, even if that shits not true (which I doubt). 
t1_dt0fg4k	0	*	Actually... not to live the stereotype, but I did get it back the second time with a full tank of gas, and washer fluid in the trunk.  The person who stole it was living in it, but still!

t1_dt0396p	0	*	Wow...you weren't kidding. 
t1_dszzs5v	1	*	I guess. But it's simply reputation change post mortem. 
t1_dszy6v5	1	*	I was going to include the Habs, Canucks, and Oilers too but didn't want to go overboard. 
t1_dszxenb	1	*	But not everyone's a what you call truther if they want to find the truth about this attack, you must understand this. The official investigation is appallingly lacking.
t1_dt0sgd3	1	*	You do understand I don't control other commentors, right? 
t1_dszv8pa	0	*	If this was a murder, then it was clearly done by professionals. In which case, cameras wouldn't have altered the final outcome.
t1_dszvsft	0	*	Hidden cameras don't stop murders, they just record them. They'd be dead either way.
t1_dt0e9ls	0	*	> Then again we have seen cases where you get in your SUV and OnSTAR locks the doors, floors the accelerator and drives you into a pole once you're at 80-90 mph  No, we haven't. 
t1_dszwkdm	0	*	Its not just that to be honest. Its also this love affair people seem to have with the Canadian PM.
t1_dt46116	0	*	No, now you're just hedging.

t1_dszzum8	1	*	Depends. Today? Nothing would happen. 25 months ago it would be a big fucking deal.  
t1_dsztvd4	1	*	Therefore, he wasn't wrong.   He was just an asshole.
t1_dt013qr	0	*	Yay story time

t1_dt07qef	0	*	It would take a lot more than nuclear war to make the planet uninhabitable, even completely destroying a small country would be difficult.
t1_dszwm33	1	*	Appreciate the response. 
t1_dszwyf6	0	*	Huh? That dude is completely rational, and right too. What exactly did you read in that comment that you would consider a vast over-estimation?
t1_dszx4iq	0	*	Holy shit it's a thing now. 
t1_dszzqot	1	*	We don't generally throw the National Security card as often as some other nations.   Its a significant loss to the country but not a national security issue. Apotex will live on without him.

t1_dt4yav8	0	*	You think all weed smells like a skunk? Having lived in an area frequented by skunks I can tell you the smell is miles different to anyone familiar with both scents.

t1_dsjsvon	0	*	We didn't exactly have a nuclear stockpile at that point. Dropping it in the ocean would be a dumb idea.
t1_dsjw1jm	1	*	Starving is a horrible way to go. I feel like being nuked would be a rather quick death if you were near the explosion. The radiation on the other hand...

t1_ds9oo9h	0	*	Doesn't sound like a successful business if paying people a decent wage is beyond you.  Next time maybe you can get interns to work for you for nothing.

t1_ds8s9fx	1	*	Funny, that's exactly why the benefits are being taken away from those minimum wage workers. Unfortunately, they disagree with you about what's wrong with their business model.
t1_ds8t4fc	0	*	> could  > more  > looking at  > suggests  > consider  > spurs  Show me examples of things *actually* happening, not what *may* happen. I have shown where it *actually* has not happened.

t1_duindfg	1	*	You claimed fallacies first.  I'll show you mine if you show me yours! ;)
t1_duicffx	1	*	Hahaha
t1_duiek9l	1	*	Same. Its a shame. 
t1_duiasfh	0	*	Because I don't believe taking money forcefully from someone is the right answer. I strongly believe they need to choose to serve their community on their own.
t1_duibpu3	1	*	In orlando fl, which is a big city near enough to the coast, $150k a year would have you set even for a family of 4.

t1_duiba0e	0	*	It'll work this time, I SWEAR!
t1_duibwjv	0	*	That is the thing when people site the 90% tax thing as people paying their fair share.  It is unadulterated bullshit.  They just bought off, donated to campaigns, to politicians.
t1_duibhqp	1	*	Wait for people commenting who don't believe this. This story is not uncommon if you live in the countryside. There's a lot of land out there.
t1_duidaqq	1	*	>Why do you think that? My 401k is pretty great. My employer matches 120% for the first 6% of my income,  Good luck finding that in a lot of jobs nowadays...   
t1_duiadl0	1	*	In this scenario, only the $100 was taxed already, the gained $20 has not been taxed.
t1_duia0su	1	*	I know right? I need to lick them.
t1_dui903u	1	*	The upper crust a few crumbs held together by a lot of dough
t1_duic341	0	*	I think it's pretty rich for you to show up and just lay down the platitude, it's been broken for decades and then start demanding sources from anyone who disagrees. 
t1_duire1f	1	*	Should the government decide how much money is too much money for a personal level? While I may sorta agree it kinda goes against laissez faire and capitalism and smells like tyranny
t1_duifc6b	1	*	That's how you know he's completely full of shit instead of just half full of shit. 
t1_dui7hp8	0	*	Family farms are pretty much a myth nowadays, more than 90% of farming is done by massive agribusiness corps.
t1_dui8a02	0	*	Because the government wants to incentivize certain things and disincentivize others. 
t1_dui9z2i	0	*	Mighty fine assumptions there.
t1_duilmst	1	*	Fair enough, I define it as anyone who would have had to actually work their whole life in order to survive. I did however note that he was well off.
t1_duiahju	1	*	You didnt hear? Millennials killed the boot industry 
t1_duibism	1	*	Yeah that whole thing was nonsensical.
t1_duibonn	0	*	Yeah but she doesn't know that and he's hell-bent on coming across as a lowly exchange student, not a heir apparent.
t1_dui9g2v	1	*	Pretty sure they are talking about both college educated jobs and big city jobs where the cost of living can be obscene so the companies generally have to pay way more as well.
t1_duic9sk	0	*	Cool. Like I said, I could give less of a shit about efficiency. I like my computer, but I'll gladly have had them never be invented if it means bill gates didn't fuck over his workers to get it done.
t1_dui7gjr	1	*	Yeah but its not Bill Gates-level rich. That's high-earning 30 year old DINKS in NYC level of wealth.
t1_duibgdm	1	*	In Australia it's dumped on top of your taxable income (reduced by 50% if asset is held for more than 12 months)
t1_duie1yd	0	*	So if I was rich I'd just need to buy a farm before I died. Then my kids could decide that farming isn't for them and sell it off to a different old rich guy.

t1_duia4y0	0	*	Living in an expensive city is a choice. There are very few jobs that are specific to a single city. 
t1_dui9uue	0	*	No, I already gave you proof that people in the 50s and 60s still payed more in taxes than we do now, even with loopholes. Also, newsflash: there are still plenty of tax loopholes out there today. 
t1_duibekl	0	*	Well good thing the US isn't corrupt at all then. Whew.
t1_duibkuu	1	*	> people living near one another could split the costs. Have shared armies.  Excellent idea. We could call it a government.
t1_duibfqg	0	*	The super poor?
t1_duli7wf	1	*	How do you think they got said special contracts from government officials in the first place? Massive bribes.
t1_dui9dop	1	*	Found boots, but they only have laces. Anyone have some extra straps?
t1_duib41k	0	*	But let's say ur job is to be a manager. If u don't take a cut of each of your workers' productivity,  then does that mean that you added 0 value?
t1_duimyrl	0	*	All right. So you're just saying that if there were to be a one-world government, it would have to be instituted by force?
t1_dui2dnu	0	*	By your definition, the 47% that pay zero federal income tax are freeloaders.
t1_dui7zlv	1	*	Theres probably a distinction to be made between self employed people and business owners who employ others.
t1_duii9p2	0	*	How it could be fair? Even 50% is discouraging, barring people from earning the money.

t1_dui8rie	0	*	I guess that's fine if you're okay with the workers who build superyachts losing business.  They have families to feed too, I presume.
t1_dui920y	0	*	https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Location=New-York-NY/Salary/by_Degree  Actually it would be the case pretty soundly.
t1_duidw0p	0	*	Right, but the whole point of Social Security was to be a minimum safety net for people too old to work. So in that sense, the poor have to get out more than what they pay in.
t1_duibbbv	0	*	yes, that's what I said
t1_dui1y28	1	*	No, thats not how it works because Im not the only one driving on that road. 
t1_duinenx	1	*	Well it does move the money out of ones estate thus saving on estate tax. But thats different than the deduction. 
t1_duk5lmx	1	*	Well, let's not get pedantic. Any noun is a thing.
t1_duignky	1	*	For profit everything is a good idea. What you work for free?
t1_duivjy1	1	*	Btw if it means anything, I make roughly 25k a year.
t1_duj5dzj	1	*	Hit the nail on the head
t1_duiqq60	0	*	Did you consider to move to the no-income tax/no-sales tax state? California is one of the worst state when it comes to fees and taxes.
t1_duiaesd	0	*	We all pay for systems we barely use or maybe never use by let's keep it close to even for the amount put into it.
t1_duin707	0	*	Correct, but if you add 6.65% New York State tax and New York City 3.8%, you end up at 101.45% marginal tax rate.
t1_duibbnh	0	*	We beat many of those high taxed countries in many things. I'd rather have my liberty.
t1_duilxgr	0	*	I think community is important and I value it. But id never bet my life on what other people do. I can hope and still not trust people.
t1_duiduq3	1	*	I mean, in context.. not really. That guy clearly believes they're not paying anything. 
t1_dui9lpo	1	*	I definitely wouldnt disagree with that. 
t1_duiku7w	1	*	urite   I really wish our nuclear reactors weren't all 50 years old and carried such bad stigmas... :-/
t1_duifbdo	1	*	It's crazy how little some people know but doesn't stop them from being strongly opinionated

t1_duibi92	0	*	You really think moving to a new country with a new culture is around the same difficulty as moving one state over?
t1_duibarg	0	*	In favor of what?  If I'm paying taxes, by definition I'm making money. So the option is what? Be careful not to make money? 
t1_duiepn6	0	*	But that's true in any non-communist system . . .
t1_duib07x	1	*	$950 a month in Eastern PA will get me a nice refrigerator box under bridge. But honestly that'll get me like a 800sqft appartment.
t1_dui9gxi	0	*	EDIT: I used wrong brackets..... so yes if you make out 401k contributions and HSA you can get this low.  
t1_dui94ij	0	*	But we're not talking about the markets here, we're talking about federal spending and the deficit
t1_duik5oz	0	*	> With a single payer, less admin., easier to negotiate prices, implies lower overall cost  It would be naive to expect that if it would be run by the government.
t1_duinto8	1	*	As if that is not enough the proposal is to tax all other valuable assets.
t1_duicah6	0	*	Also don't twist my words by talking about welfare or equality to make it out as if my opinion is somehow related to that. 
t1_duie06k	1	*	Damn youre intelligent! fuck me! Incredible.
t1_duif7k4	1	*	Most people feel that way, right up until they find themselves in a position where they can literally *buy the laws they want* to work in their favor.
t1_dui9yzg	1	*	Not up to that amount. Tax brackets in themselves are fine. 
t1_duicrby	0	*	Oh damn, you're actually right. My bad.  EDIT: Wait but these sources seem to suggest that the government has more influence than all other economic causes combined on increasing inflation
t1_duia5ty	0	*	This is a lie. For example, at 130k you cannot take child tax credit. It's completely phased out.    How do you like it when someone calls you out for bullshitting ?
t1_duicyrh	0	*	I think we have a spending problem not a income problem.
t1_duibpgw	0	*	I like how you keep including yourself saying we constantly where in reality it seems like your father/mother do all the savings.
t1_duiaht7	1	*	isn't it disgusting how few seem to understand this lol
t1_duifisb	1	*	The average redditor doesnt have a very good understanding of how investments work, considering how often its referred to as gambling.

t1_duiduge	1	*	Whats a fair difference then?

t1_duzhvwk	0	*	They are representing their constituents who don't live in the Northeast. How would someone in Denver or St. Louis benefit from the Northeast getting high speed rail?
t1_duzafa7	1	*	It's also believed that China spends more than they admit on their military.
t1_duz9dqj	1	*	well,to be fair, 1% of China's GDP is a massive amount too...
t1_duz9xff	0	*	Wouldn't spending 2%(2.1) instead of 3%(3.5) mean a quarter trillion or so annually? That seems pretty significant.
t1_duzdpcj	1	*	GPS became available to the public in the 80s and was fully operational by 95.
t1_duzmkb1	1	*	Are you really trying to compare the standard of living between China and US?
t1_duz92s0	0	*	Yah, I died three times growing up. /s  This isn't to say it's acceptable or not a big problem.  But, for example, we have a much bigger bloodbath on our roads than any problem of deliberate violence.
t1_duzgrdi	1	*	Sure, which is why you have to look at citations, especially by other countries. The US leads in that as well. It means we are doing work that is relevant to the work others are doing.
t1_duzf4n6	0	*	I don't think that's a relevant metric, in my opinion. I believe we have the highest rate of citations from other countries. That carries some weight in my book.
t1_duzhbua	0	*	oh well thank god you are able to give it an objective read..

t1_duzdzgk	1	*	We were talking about someone stating something that is just untrue: that the US only spends money on military research. That's all. The thread past that point has seemed to devolve.
t1_duzefze	1	*	It helps immensely when you control the narrative. Two parties, polarized votes and misinformation. A perfect trinity of control.  
t1_dv06n36	1	*	Sure. Have you never been to Europe? Unisex bathrooms everywhere. Why are you going to molest or assault someone?

t1_dtecgq0	0	*	They don't have to, sterilization is much more humane and a less of a shock to the economy/society.  
t1_dteo0yk	0	*	Maybe if we eat 100% all food we produce, instead of throwing out 40% of it because this apple is not perfectly round and that banana is slightly off coloured, we'll be fine too.    So many options!

t1_dtcqw2x	0	*	The necessity of meat in early human evolution has little bearing on its modern-day necessity. There are better arguments for eating meat than that weak reasoning.
t1_dtdj658	0	*	Agreed, but we would only need to produce about half the soy and corn we do now to feed the world population if they were all on plant based diets.

t1_dtcqdfl	0	*	I'd bee old enough to *want* death at that time. The day my dick stops getting hard, is the day my existence becomes of no value to me.
t1_dtcuto3	1	*	Yeah.  It's just like any other continent.  Some areas are better, Germany has quite a bit of ariable land but the southern region is dominated by the Alps and won't he as productive.  
t1_dtfskew	1	*	Not sure I'm understanding you? I'm saying saturated fat is bad and canola oil has less saturated fat than other common cooking oils like olive and corn oil.

t1_dtcn9p6	1	*	Iirc, its something they're medicated for and it's one of the reasons they are given antibiotics in feed in some feedlots
t1_dtdxfyu	1	*	I guess I should have used a different example, my apologies.
t1_dtctcg0	1	*	Sorry, I got you mixed up with the person before you.

t1_dtcs0cd	1	*	xa1Soy Milk!
t1_dtctg0q	0	*	When the fuck did I ever say I'm the _only_ one who cares about the planet? Obviously you don't since you think we're demented for recommending people to stop breeding and ruining the planet.
t1_dtdscvk	0	*	>I can't control  I'm sorry to hear that someone is shoving food down your throat.
t1_dtde1on	0	*	Ok, how do you propose those companies reduce emissions? Because one of the answers is reducing demand for stuff that require emission which will cause those companies to reduce supply.
t1_dtcvfms	0	*	While I see what you're getting at, the discussion here was about environmental impact, not the suffering of animals
t1_dtd73yz	0	*	It's called an anecdote 
t1_dtco20w	0	*	Lol, everyone who uses oil products has a hard on for the oil industry.  It's just whether or not they're ignorant about it or not.
t1_dtcm6la	1	*	y mi hacha!

t1_dv30vae	0	*	Arguing morality with a moral-relativist is like trying to punch a teleporter. Feeling right trumps acting right in this arena. Use an empathy attack for maximum damage.
t1_duex3b6	1	*	It is always unacceptable no matter who does that.  Our day and age is irrelevant btw, these kind of actions will always take place unfortunately. 
t1_dt86yct	0	*	Great, now why did it tick closer before that? Before you could say shit we are closer to nuclear war. Now it could be just about anything that no on can relate to now.

t1_dt1a0sa	1	*	I seriously doubt it's cheaper. They straight up bought them because they didnt' have any when fighting Georgia, and Georgia had drones.
t1_du96fgp	0	*	Your life must be pretty awful.  I hope you find some happiness.
t1_dskxkjo	0	*	So everyone is saying these countries are in fact shitholes but the president should not be saying this. This is not racism get out of here. Like another comment mentioned it would be classism. 
t1_dslm104	0	*	I don't believe there's precedent in the actual definition in regards to the point you're making. Correct me if I'm wrong.
t1_dsldj6p	0	*	Why would only one democrat claim this? If it was TRUE wouldn't multiple come out and back him? Doesn't seem to be the case. So you're taking one persons word based off of what? 
t1_dskl3wt	0	*	The racist part is saying hed prefer people from Norway.  Not calling the countries shit-holes.
t1_dslk9gc	0	*	Paying taxes to make sure your country and government functions is a pretty fucking low bar for your definition of utopia
t1_dslvp2q	0	*	Yeah thats kind of how hearsay works...
t1_dsl8lle	0	*	Which president was he running from, and why did it prevent him from running from that president?

t1_dsliwy9	1	*	Which is fine but should there be contingencies on who gets to stay based on whether they prove themselves?  As it is we cant even control overstayed visas. 
t1_dslvxwa	0	*	I personally think the only immigrants we should accept are big tiddy goth girls 
t1_dslpifk	1	*	That is a step in the right direction, but there is still more that should be done to rebalance this.

t1_dslvitb	1	*	> I figure you'd have figured that racist was implied with 'stupid', but eh. I'll be more explicit.  Lmao your comment is stupid.   That means its also racist.

t1_dsokrn0	0	*	The Republican platform or the imaginary KKK Republicans in your head?
t1_dslgw13	1	*	Low tier discussion as usual. There's no such thing as ethnically Cuban. Ted Cruz's dad is Spanish-Cuban and his mom mostly Irish-American. Therefore he'd be considered white in the US. 
t1_dsllvbr	0	*	No, but I don't think you get my point.
t1_dsloj0p	1	*	Yo, come on man were working on it! Don't cut us loose just yet!

t1_dslkiru	1	*	Nah. That's an even bigger shithole. 
t1_dt31dri	0	*	You seem like it. You wrote three paragraphs saying defending China's land grabs.  >the US has never suffered a total war on their soil.  The civil war.
t1_dtzvnz0	0	*	Well we haven't found him. Instead we're deporting the guy who peeled potatoes and had no idea the concentration camps were a thing.

t1_dt3kzgj	1	*	Or the transition from an industrial economy to a service economy creates social unrest. 
t1_ds81xkl	0	*	Not exactly but running into an open knife knowingly wouldn't be my first choice.  What is needed is dialogue more than every physical action at this point.
t1_duu8vpz	0	*	And you know.. political opponents and critics being assasinated? Freedom of speech is definately more respected in US
t1_duxcpl1	1	*	Words and words, oh and words. Smart words used to convey meaning of something assumed. Followed by words.

t1_duq5uew	0	*	Even if it was land taken from blacks just a few decades ago?
t1_duptnrr	0	*	That was the same argument Mugabe made in Zimbabwe.  It turns out, he didn't give the land to farmers, he gave them to cronies and the land was basically ruined for agriculture.  
t1_duq4nvz	0	*	So they are taking land from rich black people too?
t1_dugm7ol	1	*	Let's deal with 3d printers when they matter. No one wants to take your guns away.

t1_du2vizk	0	*	So it's like - tens of thousands people, right?  Common sense - no? 
t1_du3c80u	0	*	You're making the totally mistaken assumption that the others have all four.  In reality, steroids take someone pathetic and make them competitive with someone who wasn't pathetic trash to begin with.
t1_du2v9de	1	*	No, it's how an investigation works.

t1_dts8iq8	1	*	Depends. There can be good reason in storing especially future times in local. 
t1_dts1ji5	1	*	Asking those last 3 countrys to do that might be asking for to much. 
t1_dtru8ja	1	*	Sorry, my country is too rock stupid for that. 
t1_ds6sgew	0	*	International human law that many countries ignore. War crimes may be codified and interpreted at the national level.
t1_ds6ibpj	1	*	> It does if the decision is about dismantling democracy and destroying democratic institutions.  You've confused product and process. 
t1_ds6j9ff	1	*	That absolute classic may turn out to be an incorrect (or badly researched) prediction.  Claiming the NHS will get an extra xa3350mil is a straight-up blatant lie.
t1_duyneoq	0	*	If these school shootings is a gun related issue how come it's only a recent problem? 
t1_dudq2hr	0	*	Wrong. That's not how Turkish Elections work. AKP has never exceeded 49.5% of the vote. 
t1_dudulbp	0	*	How many pictures of what the US did to Iraq and Afghanistan do you need?
t1_dud8ulf	0	*	So your solution is to attempt the biggest ethnic cleansing in history just because and relocate ~60 million Turks from anatolia to where? Turkmenistan? lol good luck with that. 
t1_dsrurgo	1	*	So what happens? If someone chooses a side they are in the wrong, if no one does anything and lets them duke it out it's a human rights catastrophe...

t1_dtsp1tb	1	*	It's like I'm trying to talk to a fucking pokemon named LMAO.
t1_dtspl0l	0	*	You are right, I miss read what you wrote. The second part is true. People, not necessarily you, tend to not understand how deductions works.

t1_dup06ku	1	*	Because people are buying GPUs to mine other crypto-currencies, which are also valuable.

t1_dtppa5u	0	*	Iirc, the US did pay 200k USD per victim (while officially not admitting liability) a few years later.
t1_dtom42v	0	*	What if... they're shooting at you? Just as a hypothetical, this must be an exception. Nobody is going to take fire over honour.
t1_dtoz3s5	1	*	Kill the pilot for maybe bombing the place they live in.  The nerve of some people 
t1_dtoz34v	0	*	Exact same in American aircraft though. That's the reason for the G Suits when flying jets.
t1_dtop1b9	1	*	Its preferable to have 1 million dead than 10 million dead..
t1_dtowk28	0	*	Except the gun it uses, as direct gun support from air is preety much obselete.  And what is A-10 without it's gun ?
t1_dtoowj1	1	*	You shouldn't simply name someone that has a different opinion a putinbot.
t1_dtp13p3	1	*	Which makes them combatant.
t1_dtoombz	0	*	They already have them.
t1_dtp0vlz	1	*	Neither of them are correct. AM is ante meridian (before the middle) and PM is post meridian (after the middle).  It's 12 midnight and 12 midday. 
t1_dtolwtv	0	*	May be true for ejecting pilots but definitly not true for invading paratroopers.
t1_dtpczx9	0	*	You have Google I'm not your mother
t1_dtpk8yr	1	*	Ok. I thought you were sarcastic. 
t1_dtp00qf	1	*	> Though if the A-10 is engaging with its GAU-8 gun  Totally didn't go BRRRRRAAAAAPPPP in my head.
t1_dtoonas	0	*	> Thread is just mostly aimed at the Wehrmacht.^^  In a story about the russian military, doesn't make a lot of sense to leave out russian ww2 war crimes if one is delving into german ww2 war crimes.
t1_dtp24o1	1	*	No, Im working with fat fingers and a cheeky autocorrect. Edit incoming. Thanks for the heads up.
t1_dtorllv	1	*	Yup, I'll settle for this, too. Good idea.
t1_dtp3pkq	0	*	Literally years ago and they make up a tiny minority, what's your point again? Also did u even look at the posts? Find anything actually bad about them? 
t1_dtoqc9z	1	*	Also wildlife can be a concern, depending on where they land.
t1_dtp5cz1	1	*	He also took a pretty nasty hit from an explosive bullet to the jaw (half his face was missing). Even if he did count he could easily have a fair bit of memory loss after being in a coma for a week.
t1_dsf8xbk	1	*	If you only go to the middle of Mexico it's a developed nation. The South is poor and indigenous and the North is where the cartels fight for control
t1_dsfubl5	1	*	And that is related to any of this... how?
t1_dtqv5kw	0	*	You know hunting is legal.
t1_dsem8nk	0	*	Does anyone outside US still sign for credit card transactions? 
t1_dse50ii	0	*	I was referring to Bitcoin.
t1_dse6wsa	1	*	IMO a couple is 2, a few is 3-5. however the definition of a few is a small number greater than 1 so maybe we are both correct   Either way as a player Im glad its still populated
t1_dsdsi18	0	*	Ah but miners also act as full nodes for those other cryptocurrencies. Here we don't have mining as an incentive. 
t1_dsddyd6	0	*	I thought Trump people mostly thought the new Star Wars was SJW propoganda.
t1_dse54fb	0	*	nowhere there did you mention what the designed incentives are for running the node
t1_dsdvi6b	1	*	Tested as in simulated. Can you point out the way where this high figure comes from?
t1_dsdzqvl	0	*	They are highly untested and expecting it to just work securely at scale is laughable.   What incentives do people have for running nodes?
t1_dse57vx	0	*	a full node? a node that matters for purposes of decentralization? Or will the vote be outweighed by a big boy node?
t1_dsdi3cb	0	*	I knew there was no way I was ahead of the curve of cryptomanipulation
t1_dsdi17u	0	*	Or a secret community of redditors banding together to create an artificial appearance of demand, then jump ship.  Anyone? 
t1_dsdsqfp	1	*	Cool, thanks for taking the time to respond and explain things.
t1_dsdbigz	1	*	Damn you!  I remember umming and arrring at $80.  I wish I had just gone all in back then.
t1_dsdzth4	1	*	speak for yourself. nothing has been proven in terms of secure scaling for XRB. 
t1_dse44rw	0	*	I don't think either of them have delivered yet. People overestimate how far along crypto is. This is like angel investor stage.
t1_dsf69ay	0	*	It doesn't cost more to operate the mine though. Mining Bitcoin is still very much profitable with the right equipment.
t1_dsdi9qz	0	*	You did care enough to downvote me U0001f605
t1_dse3ahq	1	*	Ha, downvoted.
t1_dse3ori	0	*	BFA or Battle for Azeroth is the next one yeah. But it won't be the last one, far from that.

t1_dsdbpuz	0	*	If you think it's a bubble, sell your house and live in a tent before said bubble pops -> buy house back once prices have crashed
t1_dsda79g	0	*	House prices fell down 10-20ish percent because houses were still usable and useful. There is nothing backing up bitcoins. Bitcoins have potential to drop down to zero.

t1_dset966	0	*	100% pre-mined? Ah. That might be a bit contentious.
t1_dsda1bj	0	*	No, the housing market was a bubble at that time.  It's not always and forever a bubble.

t1_dtmi30i	0	*	Binged is something else entirely. I think he meant *bung*, or *bingd*.
t1_dtmjasf	1	*	I have seen uncensored news come up and r/conservative a few times
t1_dtmdp9e	0	*	What my cats do does matter, because I'm also raising a bird, which is prey for cats.
t1_dtmiprd	0	*	Larger European powers were also massively appeasing Nazi Germany all the way up to 1939, so we can't be hypocrites about the U.S. trading with them.
t1_dtmjs0y	0	*	What would you suggest?
t1_dtminau	0	*	When you're attacking FBI agents because you're under criminal investigation, you're losing
t1_dtmu3sx	0	*	Like charley roses Russia story that he made up for cbs?
t1_dtmj8g6	1	*	Sure, they both work on the same principle, the difference is only the way they get the steam.
t1_dtmiab9	0	*	I can really see this World Wide Web thing taking off someday, but it's too early to tell.
t1_dtorxhg	1	*	Afaik that's not right, that befalls on the foreign affair ministry office of each country (aka the Council), not the parliaments.
t1_dtn0gvw	0	*	I'm sure it has nothing to do with the huge tax incentives like with the Wisconsin Foxconn plant.
t1_dtml81v	0	*	He actually is NOT relevant in THIS matter because trade negotiations happen at the EU level.
t1_dtn448q	1	*	They actually don't maintain borders anymore, not within the EU at least. They have free travel. And trade deals *have* to go through the EU. They can't negotiate individually. 
t1_dtmromh	0	*	As long as you think of climate change as an us vs them instead of humanity trying to better itself, you're doing it wrong. 
t1_dtn47ij	0	*	lol bleet bleet bleet is what I heard. I'm sure america sucks that's why people from literally every country on earth want to come live here. Must suck.
t1_dtmk6jp	1	*	And where can I find this Jeeves guy? Dont tell me I have to google it :(
t1_dtmg357	1	*	Take me higher
t1_dtn86ym	0	*	Even if I grant you that, they also have a shit ton of money invested in the US via real estate and other ventures, that 18% is only the tip of how important a healthy US economy is to Chinas. 
t1_dtmmo7t	0	*	That's what you think is going on?
t1_dtn6zl4	0	*	Seems like a logistical nightmare 
t1_dtmjjmt	0	*	Well I think generally, if you start getting in the habit of cancelling trade deals, people will stop wanting to make them with you and you'll have to start making ones that are worse and worse.
t1_dtmijyh	0	*	Preach, brutha.  Thank God we have Fox News to show us the way.
t1_dtmi6gu	1	*	feels good
t1_dtmqbp8	0	*	That's an awful lot of work to read some random webpage. If this is real news, the NYT et al will run the story later.
t1_dtmrz5j	0	*	US is stil lthe first arms exporter of the world. I agree that UK is second but will soon not be europe anymore.
t1_dtmq4c5	0	*	In other words, I read it closely.  Would you like to know exactly where each of these points occur (minus, obviously, the parts about pollution and power that don't exist)?
t1_dtmpawn	1	*	Congrats on being in the upper class! Most everyone else will be suffering in a few years from increased taxes.
t1_dtn415f	1	*	You can't make a deal just with France. It has to be with the whole of the EU. Also, it [has been confirmed](https://twitter.com/MalmstromEU/status/959114117490585600) by an EU commissioner.
t1_dtmhxqg	1	*	Navigated the Netscape. 
t1_dtmt5bl	1	*	Jesus, it's like you're not even reading what I'm saying.  Per Capita Rankings:  >1.) Saudi Arabia - 16.85  >2.) Australia - 15.83  >3.) **United States** - **15.53**  >4.) Canada - 15.32
t1_dtmq7hg	0	*	What do you mean by obscure block?
t1_dtmjmad	1	*	Technically i was right. The question was about secretary of state without any relevant political system context given (:
t1_dtmlbd4	1	*	Yes, these investigations take a long time when there's a lot to uncover.   Now try to explain away the indictments.
t1_dtmi5kn	1	*	Excited
t1_dujfy4o	1	*	You ok?
t1_dtmpexi	1	*	That's very true!
t1_dtmj8nc	0	*	Where is good for news? 
t1_dtn939w	1	*	Yes but this is not what these people are fearing (as they shouldn't, considering how extremely rare that is). They're just buying into FUD.
t1_dtmggt4	1	*	> Given that France is ready to veto an EU trade deal over it  Uhhh lets not get ahead of ourselves here.
t1_dtn8e6z	1	*	It was just a general statement that was made based on the comment above.  People are reading way too much into it.
t1_dtmjmpc	1	*	I'm not a bastion of hope, but Jesus he just randomly replies to people with completely negative comments and sarcastic/mean replies.
t1_dtmk452	0	*	That's nice I wouldn't mind see the verified outlets and seeing if it's verified or just citing one article who's citing the same unnamed sources.  It seems to go that way alot 
t1_dtmr8hq	0	*	what subs are you used to where this level of discourse isn't downvoted?
t1_dtn1z3g	0	*	Boeing and Airbus aren't the only plane manufacturers, there are others that do produce those other designs that Boeing may not.
t1_dtms0s4	1	*	The guy is relating it to US politics. He literally said that this is like a US Congressman saying something in a speech - i.e. is just him talking and not official policy.  Reread it.
t1_dtmlcw0	1	*	My cat is a sweetheart, not a killer. Don't you dare defile the name of Reesey Cat!
t1_dtmr187	0	*	>Just as they like to feel morally superior about war yet they allow their members to keep selling weapons to the countries that use them.   How is this relevant?   I 
t1_dtmochr	1	*	On top of that, the European Commission has the same stance. Paris Agreement must be included in future trade agreements.  TTIP is effectively dead until US joins Paris again.
t1_dtml5kg	1	*	Maybe if they say it enough it will magically become true lol. 
t1_dtn40rk	0	*	How is it self-righteous?  It's fairly well known that people here don't read articles, they mostly read headlines.  Regardless of if this headline is accurate or not, that's a true statement.
t1_dtnt2pl	0	*	Not strawmanning anything.  You presented a personal claim about me which is false.  Not my problem.
t1_dtuojcn	1	*	Really, a president who repeatedly make a statements about prefering a government shutdown other than get his way isn't relevant to a pattern of non progessional behavior 
t1_dtv3irt	1	*	Can't find any reference to 1 in 5 federal prisoners. That citation is for DHS reporting on ICE. It should be 100%, unless ICE is detaining citizens. One wonders who the 8% are.
t1_dtuqr7d	1	*	Ah without a freaking doubt, just a shame mobile users are drawing a short straw with the information.
t1_dtuqfw1	0	*	It's a good point, but it's BS that mobile and desktop viewers are basically told a different story 
t1_dsf4l46	0	*	What stance is that? Your stance of its better to go along with terrorists because they might kill you.
t1_dsfaotv	0	*	Yeah... The west doesn't go to war or interfere unless the US has some kind of material gain from it.  Did the UN at least send an angry letter?
t1_dsfk4bm	0	*	It costs less to kill someone with a life sentence than it does to feed them for the duration of their sentence.  Also Giving them running water and heat and shelter.   
t1_dsfhgdu	0	*	Yep
t1_dsf0umw	1	*	>  I'm seeing a decidedly scary regression happening  What specifically are you referring to?

t1_ds1skl9	0	*	No, but you did back a coup. 
t1_dsl82in	1	*	Although I dont agree completely. I think this article puts what you are trying to say nicely  https://www.raconteur.net/culture/american-culture-rules-the-world
t1_dslb5sb	0	*	Nope! Walked it after I decided I hated my job.
t1_dskqim4	1	*	Plus Extremexf1os have the sexiest accents imo.
t1_dtei1f5	0	*	Your sources magically disappeared when you pressed enter. Could you please resubmit your comment with all of the cited sources for your clams?
t1_dtfh8fe	0	*	Kurdish is not an official language of Turkey. Should it be? Should schools teach in Kurdish?
t1_dteh2pe	0	*	Can you tell me what was different about what happened to the Armenians or Greeks that makes it classified as Genocide but not the Ottoman Muslims? 
t1_dtez8c0	1	*	Oh, of course, the United States would never actually do it. Such a threat would certainly be the wake up call the rest of Europe needs. 
t1_dtedhpc	0	*	If you're Turkish, the odds are that your mother or father is probably Kurdish.    Why do you hate the Kurds so much when they are not just part of your culture, but literally part of your DNA?
t1_dylke4w	1	*	...and thats the whole story. The end. 
t1_dsbyg63	0	*	Retweeting something is now supporting a group...good to know
t1_dsdmm8w	1	*	You are saying it's fine to be a racist fuckhead as the only other choice is unlimited immigration and rising racial tension...
t1_dsbvdvo	1	*	Trump is a moron but you are kidding yourself if you don't think presidents have taunted other leaders.  They just do it with more style, but the message is the same...our button is bigger
t1_dsbox6j	0	*	Because that's not how trade deals work.  I'm pretty tired of the constant whatabouts, It must be said.
t1_duuelt4	1	*	Statements often change as a result of ongoing investigations. 
t1_duaxm0z	1	*	So your fantasy has very little to do with how things are out there. It's a great what if exercise, but nothing else.
t1_duawuup	0	*	Yea. That's why I came down here to the depths of hell to ask you if you read your own link.
t1_duav3sk	1	*	Right we are. Then which bit of the above am I wrong on so? 
t1_dub7llo	0	*	Im a white electrician and Im doing fine, but pointing out flaws in the system is how to start down the path to fixing them. 
t1_ds2j244	1	*	So? China is the biggest producer in the world and their cars are crap. That's why every cab in Shanghai is made by Volkswagen.
t1_ds22k8a	1	*	Yeah there were a few other notable parties that hand a hand in the destruction of Iraq and Syria as well. 
t1_ds1yejp	0	*	No one, is to stone anyone, until I blow this whistle!

t1_dtnqu01	0	*	Nah that's bulimia, I think you're talking about a castrated bull. 
t1_dtmvycu	0	*	Well sounds like we agree more than disagree. 
t1_dtn7qof	0	*	Such a sad life you live.
t1_dtmyd8u	1	*	Stuck somewhere? Like someone locked you in a room and forced you to read TD posts? Nobody is stuck. You have to go seeking out that sort of trash if it's going to work on you.
t1_dtzm3s3	1	*	Ah, my local hospital doesn't have parking charges.
t1_dtz8uk3	0	*	Then how are you so incorrect about what life in the UK is actually like?
t1_dtzi5vn	0	*	You have had personal experience with 90% of the 750,000 Americans that went abroad for surgery? That is impressive.
t1_dtxokat	0	*	Which country would be first world for you then?!

t1_dur2zr7	0	*	Like pro life and Christian bakeries
t1_duqwz5q	0	*	Lol did you just compare guns to steak knives and pressure cookers?  What is the purpose of a gun? What is the reason for guns existing?
t1_dup02iz	1	*	I think it's clear you have no idea what you're talking about. Try to save some dignity and give it a rest. 
t1_dsuomi3	0	*	Lol no, it's inherently wasteful and destructive. Do you realize how much energy is wasted converting plant matter into animal tissue?

t1_dut1pbj	1	*	Rather they piss $20 billion on a boarder wall than continue pissing money away fighting an already lost war in the Middle East.  Fuck Bush.
t1_dusle3c	0	*	No, it's for racist dick-stroking reasons. The wall wouldn't serve any military purpose either, since boats, planes, and explosives are a thing.
t1_dut5zaf	1	*	Virtue BatSignal, folks!   
t1_dusobls	1	*	Whatever dude. Have a good one.

t1_dut65fl	0	*	Remind me, when was the Patriot act authorized again?
t1_dusi662	0	*	I think you'll find that a large swath of the United States indeed does very strongly think that a border wall between the US and Mexico will have a legitimate benefit to the American people.
t1_dusqdyt	1	*	You say it like its a bad thing
t1_duskl5g	1	*	Remember to couple those with tactical assault wipes for maximum alphaness!
t1_dusvy4e	1	*	According to Trump politics has no role in sports. 
t1_dut9jlp	1	*	I would love to do both, man. I think business owners who hire illegals knowingly should see jail time.   That doesn't change the fact we can do both at the same time.
t1_dusjrvy	0	*	Feel free to go through my comments.   I'm getting bored. 
t1_dusjacj	0	*	Not even a little.   The wall is being built. If he wants, he can make Mexico pay for it. I don't really want him to take that route because it would be an anti trade move. 
t1_dusinng	0	*	They are, really beautiful whores. Then again thats the same for every country in the world. After all who is so stupid to pay for ugly whores.

t1_dusmguh	1	*	Better focus now, when pot is illegal in half the states 
t1_dushztc	0	*	Remember that Trump did worse than Romney. There's no way that Trump wins 2020 if he even lasts that long. He's historically unpopular and Dems are voting in record numbers.

t1_dusimy7	0	*	Let's be clear it's fucking stupid because the stars are beautiful year-round and even if it wasn't there is no recourse for Spring to appear more beautiful, no matter what they say.
t1_duskr2u	1	*	That Sears card might be worthless next week. Just sayin. 
t1_dut7ftc	1	*	Watch it *RIIIISE* up, *RIIIIISE* into the ASS of ELVES!
t1_dusq5fz	0	*	So, poorly?  Most countries would consider a mass shooting a day a rather big problem. But we all know by now that you are not like the rest of us.  You're special.
t1_dusnekv	1	*	*paid  As one of the uneducated, you can be assured of Trump's love.
t1_dutekpi	1	*	Good discussion.
t1_dusjsjd	1	*	Am i late?
t1_dutc4l8	1	*	Let me  # SHOOOOOOOWWWW YOU THE POWER OF TALOS STORMCROWN
t1_dusnqud	0	*	I literally don't understand your point, taxing wealth leaving a country is not an issue. 28 billion dollars a year.
t1_dusn2cn	0	*	I never brought up /r/politics banning the same bot, so I don't know why you're trying to shove words into my mouth.
t1_dusm3f3	1	*	Mexican here. I'll bring tacos and micheladas.
t1_dut5krn	1	*	You're hopeless and don't live in reality. How are lower taxes screwing the middle class? You know they'd never get 60 votes for any tax reform. 
t1_dust6fu	1	*	From a norse perspective, the US has always seemed odd.       Trump just made it even odder.       Those gun laws...... 
t1_dusjb9h	1	*	That was quite the journey
t1_duus90m	0	*	You haven't stated any facts. Is there any secured funding for a border wall? Have they actually started construction on the entire wall or just replacing a 2 mile section? 
t1_dusknqs	1	*	As someone who just got bent over with a $700 fee for not having healthcare last year, I can agree with you on the policies thing because theres plenty I didnt agree with Obama with lol
t1_dutecw5	0	*	I was in absolute shock he won. But like I mentioned in a previous comment, some studies showed Trump supporters have lower iqs than average....so I guess America is just full of retards.
t1_dusj9iv	0	*	Awesome. I'm sure glad that's what we're spending money on than Healthcare for our citizens.. 
t1_dusj3sl	1	*	Sub to /r/neoliberal. Its a good counter against Reddits love of various strains of toxic populism. I think youll find it helpful.
t1_duspjqe	1	*	But the less determined ones will be. 
t1_duspkll	0	*	What? The wall would be to prevent people entering illegally. 
t1_dusime8	1	*	Lol, this is great.
t1_dutyrwt	1	*	Do you think that will persist past this administration? I think it's stupid beyond belief but doubt it will even last through 2018
t1_duspkzd	1	*	Ok, then build it. 
t1_duskzv9	0	*	You and I have diametrically opposes definitions of well. Coexistence between us is sadly impossible. 
t1_dusntwl	1	*	Don't bother with that guy.
t1_dusk9bb	0	*	I kind of expected the next game to be set in the Summerset Isles and center around helping the Altmer overthrow the Thalmor, but I haven't heard anything about a sequel to Skyrim.
t1_dusp4xb	1	*	Twitter, after the latest indictments. He blamed Obama for not stopping them.
t1_dut9nl9	0	*	Well, and if precedent is any indication, it wouldnt just be a sequel.  It seems it will take another big leap forward in time and place, right?
t1_dushx5z	1	*	not if democrats come out in force in 2018 and 2020. 
t1_dusjk40	0	*	The reddiner pills are just distilled juice of [chili](https://uproxx.com/news/alex-jones-lawyer-kids-chili/).
t1_dut5v0u	0	*	Use whatever % you want.  Either way, a majority of people didnt vote against him.  Maybe focus on that and figure out why.
t1_dusj8jg	0	*	That's very incoherent. It's like saying environmentalists and vegetarians are evil people because Hitler was both.  
t1_duskxar	1	*	Taxes and keeping out immigrants. You cant hire a cheap immigrant if the cant immigrate here. 
t1_dusmxz4	0	*	i don't see how a new wall will stop any of this
t1_dusnzlo	1	*	Afraid they're my firm's, my partners and I created them and I don't think they would appreciate it :)  You never know though, I'll ask and see. I would predict they won't want to
t1_dusm99a	1	*	Wait so is Ulfric Stormcloak Trump?  I'm all confused now.
t1_dusirzg	0	*	Plus there's the elven mage in the lower level of the Blue Palace who says the headsman's axe isn't the worst fate a prisoner can meet in Solitude, especially when she's in a bad mood. 
t1_dutcutc	1	*	Agreed. Same problem across central america. Too much drugs, too much corruption, not enough stability. I don't have the answer to it. Hopefully more people will get involved and help.
t1_dusi9xn	1	*	No, and I'm not OP. I'm just answering the question you posed.
t1_dut6reh	1	*	Agreed. It's not anarchist though, more like ethnic-nationalist fascism.
t1_duskite	0	*	KK, try not to overdraw mommy's credit card to impress your friends.
t1_dusq6c4	1	*	>The one that rigged an election themselves  Do you mean the DNC supporting Clinton?  That is both their moral right to do and legal, and they did give Sanders a fair shot
t1_dusqgy8	1	*	Great place take advise from.
t1_duvx8pv	1	*	oh, true. So why not push if they hate us anyway?
t1_dutansi	1	*	Adding a piece of information doesn't equal missing the joke.

t1_dutfaz7	0	*	PR doesn't pay federal income tax among other things like capitol gains tax.
t1_duu3vvp	0	*	If you dont oppose the drug war you arent a libertarian. Its a political philosophy first and a political party second.  Eat a dick.
t1_dusr3lb	1	*	Yes you are. 
t1_dusvo1m	0	*	Better start on that Russia attack then.
t1_dusl5ni	1	*	Exactly. I think libertarians, more than liberals, tend to be pretty well represented in the tech industry.
t1_duskffa	1	*	Good point. Dont.  Better to stay where you are then come to the US.  U0001f44d dont want to see you shitting up our streets.  
t1_dusncep	1	*	That was great!
t1_dusj5p3	0	*	Fuck, that might be better than the Naruto ninja-warrior one.
t1_dusme9f	1	*	A good relationship with mexico is much better security than any wall could ever be...
t1_dusiswn	1	*	Let's be clear it's fucking stupid because the wall is broken and winter has come. Spring won't return anytime soon, no matter what the Lord of Light says.  
t1_dusp3y8	0	*	[Ha](https://i.imgur.com/BW3KLWl.jpg)
t1_dspgs31	1	*	>  It's just that typical reddit users only consider progress to be how much of a woman's thigh they can see.  And how much of her head is sliced off if a thigh is ever shown.
t1_dsoubrt	0	*	No. I'm not.
t1_dsp4881	1	*	What makes ya so sure? could be a saiyan for all we know.
t1_dt9kqlk	1	*	Thanks for admitting you are just making up bullshit.
t1_dtqe7fg	1	*	Your narrow world view saddens me.
t1_dtqe46s	1	*	That would be unconstitutional. If you are going to change the constitution for your own reasons, you might not like what others are going to write in there. 
t1_dtqhp9x	1	*	So what kind of fantasy world do you live in? Can I join? 
t1_dul4hmn	0	*	The addicts. The healthcare professionals who need to care for the addicts. The social safety nets supporting these addicts, and everyone who pays into them.  For starters.

t1_dulh29h	1	*	papa bless
t1_dulbja1	1	*	We were also colonized way longer than Japan. Spanish rule for 333 years, heavily influenced by the Catholic church, basically destroyed pre colonial history and vilified indigenous people and women.
t1_dul3uls	1	*	Thank you Circlejerk, good night.
t1_dulj8t8	0	*	There's no excuse for attempting to police another person's emotions.  If you don't like it, look away.

t1_dulki2m	1	*	they roll on, how could you even put them on inside out unless you completely open it up and the flip it inside out?
t1_dul36ke	1	*	What I got out of this is that you're a baby kicker.  That and you love puppies and are not racist.  
t1_dul60r7	0	*	Hey dude, don't do that to yourself. I know it's tempting to close your mind for a bit, but if you work on it you can achieve that same sense of calm all by yourself :) 
t1_dumdwub	1	*	This stuff started all the way back in the 30s, though, and picked up steam through the 60s, culminating in Nixon starting the war on drugs in the early 70s.
t1_dumsg4d	1	*	All a matter of perspective, not as funny or worthwhile as other comments, sure, but my comment isnt in the negative for karma

t1_dv3jwnv	0	*	For someone who hates fascists you sure are doing a good job helping them defend themselves. 2/3 of fhe country supports the settlements. That is an objective atrocity. 
t1_dv2zjmy	0	*	Majority of Israelis are middle eastern jews of iraq/iran/egypt/jordanian/morokan/etiopian/ussr descendants because there were pogroms and were huge racism.

t1_dskfhp0	0	*	if Im not mistaken, oval office meetings are public which is where he said the remark
t1_dskfv1f	1	*	Well yes, if that's your point then I agree with you. Mostly because US white supremacist seem to be pretty simple even for racists standard.
t1_dskgh3q	0	*	Right back at ya buttercup.

t1_dv6y7tg	1	*	Touche. Reddit loves Fallout.
t1_dv14tvc	1	*	Almost sounds like America
t1_dv165yp	0	*	Sources on confiscations?  Also yeah, calling people dumb fucks and hoping they don't breed is very, very smart, polite and democratic. 
t1_dv0l1nb	1	*	Probably because Lenin didn't win WW2
t1_dv2y2hj	0	*	Weapons industry for one. They sold very expensive, top of the line anti-aircraft systems to three different countries in the last year or two.
t1_dv42q80	1	*	Using Soviet-designed, Russian-built rockets because yours are too unreliable and too expensive lol
t1_dv0ybl4	0	*	You can't say it wasn't cheap because it was a) horrendously expensive, and b) economic supremacy wasn't a foreseen objective at entry.

t1_dv0r3dj	1	*	I agree. But you gotta look on the bright side in order to survive in Russia.
t1_dv1c70j	0	*	In regards to integrating into the US or Europe?  What do you mean?
t1_dv1ihmi	0	*	Ok... and? Russia providing huge amounts of armament and aerial support for Syria is a brand new status quo that didn't happen until after the election.

t1_dv34290	1	*	I have to ask - what negotiations Russia isn't pursuing?  [BTW, regarding good faith.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_sharing)
t1_dv14ony	0	*	so... you were talking about Russia.  In which case my assesment is right? I dont understand what the whole rant was about.
t1_dv1icw9	1	*	Not in the nefarious context which you are implying.  They hadn't invaded, or provided military support anywhere close to what occurred post 2012. 
t1_dv172gj	0	*	 I always appreciate constructive criticism :)
t1_dv0mzdp	0	*	They could turn left, gas up in Syria (another strategic point) and head down the Suez.   Not Saying it could happen today, but this is a long game.   Russian wheat to Egypt is a big deal.

t1_dt5s6x3	1	*	That was my point, yes. 
t1_du31tni	0	*	Just less money for research then. But I'm sure the government can use tax payer money for that. But you won't make any money from it.

t1_du8oas8	0	*	Good for you.  Nobody is hyper inflating China's real estate market.  Were also not talking about ONE condo.  Were talking about double digit ownership and conversion into ABNB or just empty

t1_dtud02c	0	*	Jews turned in Poles too. So there goes your point. 
t1_dtua2dr	0	*	polish government was in exile and the country was nazi occupied. so should be called nazi death camp. i would think less than .00001% of poles gave up jews.

t1_duv20xf	1	*	You probably should read more of the guy's comments. It's not defense for love of country.
t1_duu16rl	1	*	Oh, ya got me!
t1_dt0kbej	0	*	Because it kills the SPD. Next election AfD will be at 20% and SPD at 10.

t1_dsmeflc	0	*	Bullshit, other militaries aren't colonizing other countries and starting wars, save for the US. 
t1_dt77u8z	0	*	So then what am I missing? Just bullet out the top 3 reasons why I should believe Trump colluded with Russia.
t1_dt78il6	0	*	So that it actually happened doesn't matter at all? Amazing.
t1_dt804mi	1	*	Kinda, yeah. I'm not from US either but it's all a google search away.
t1_dt7g8ro	1	*	Their best known talent is snatching defeat from the jaws of victory.
t1_dt84b8z	0	*	What are you talking about? Republicans bitch about CNN *constantly*. Even Trump does.
t1_dt78zmu	1	*	Always Canada. Never knew so many Canadians to follow U.S. politics so closely. What makes you so impassioned about it?
t1_dt76kkg	0	*	Ah, !
t1_dt9ud9a	0	*	Its not balanced at best its 30/70 positive to negative.
t1_dtar7hd	0	*	What tune do you sing when Trump creates these stories about his adversaries?
t1_dtaqkdk	0	*	MSNBC is nowhere near the opposite end of the spectrum from Fox News. Far right to MAAAAAYYYBE center left is the full breadth of the cable TV spectrum. 
t1_dtag6v1	0	*	So he didn't refuse to come to England unless protests against him are banned? Or try to fire people who are investigating him?
t1_dtao31v	1	*	Hmm and applause.   Really though, at face value it was a mix of booing, applause and laughter, i.e. a mixed reception.
t1_dtar3dm	1	*	> He has yet to tell anyone that they can't speak.   He literally said that he wishes to revoke certain media outlets' licenses, and that slander laws should be loosened up to make suing easier.
t1_dtatnxi	1	*	Never talked that unnecessary shit. 
t1_du6zqwn	0	*	Ukrainian citizens who are literally living there are invading?? Tell me more. 
t1_du7ekvj	0	*	Shelling a city without warning is abnormal. I'm not sure where this is normal but it is certainly is not in any civilized country.
t1_dtg7c7z	1	*	Because website like wallhax is mainly used by local Chinese players
t1_dtew9p4	0	*	Nothing but distraction.  Russians cheat .because they can't be number 1 without it.   
t1_dt81080	0	*	DFINE is just being contrarian.  They suggested using a few inches of concrete to stop a dog from digging under the fence.  Doesn't work.
t1_dt8evz6	0	*	bad news, using a shock collar is a form of training  would rather the dog be uncomfortable a couple times than less sure-fire training methods which could result in the dog getting injured or lost  
t1_dt83ls4	0	*	It really doesn't seem like you do...
t1_dt8kehq	1	*	Man you are dense.
t1_dt85iar	0	*	A mild shock is not electrocuting them...

t1_dt8qk7k	0	*	He's not saying that at all - you are saying that.
t1_dt8vaet	0	*	> I've hunted with them since the day I could hold a rifle.   I always thought hunters had a separate kind of intelligence than regular humans, so that probably explains the mutual misunderstanding
t1_dt8l1oi	1	*	Man, don't ever watch someone train a horse, you'll shit yourself with indignant rage.
t1_dtyyndj	0	*	They don't but in many cases they can get away with it.
t1_dtywqd9	0	*	Don't ask me when practically every country including the US makes exceptions to freedom of speech under the belief that some forms of speech should not be protected
t1_dtz5bv9	0	*	Are you seriously denying it? Murder is a popular sport in the USA.  https://www.rt.com/op-ed/208395-police-black-children-violence-murder/
t1_dtzccuw	0	*	No. In the United States, we've implemented a different system to make sure that every vote no matter from where in the country it comes from, matters just as much. It's called the electoral college.
t1_dtze1n1	0	*	Your effort isn't too great because I'm not the guy you've been conversing with and you didn't even notice.
t1_dtzaxq9	1	*	He was quite a genius
t1_dtywmb7	0	*	Do you agree that the degree of speech restrictions is different between the US,  Germany and North Korea? 
t1_dtz4sp6	0	*	Can you give me the link to the according press release? I don't believe Reddit would ever make such an idiotic statement.
t1_dtzk10c	0	*	Advocating for illegal things (ie. doing harm to others, setting things on fire, etc.) is not protected speech in the US.  Did the guy running that site said explicitly those things?
t1_dtznudd	0	*	Well, pretty much anyone who was part of the SS committed or knew about crimes. It's not like you just randomly ended up in that organisation.
t1_dtyvebf	1	*	No, definitely not. I believe in reasonable limits to speech and the idea that it needs to be constantly debated to prevent an authoritarian slide in any direction.
t1_duduv6h	0	*	How many are billionaires?
t1_duccdn8	1	*	artists make money by selling their work.  an exclusive copy right is overkill after many millions of dollars.
t1_dtwm8n8	0	*	Hahaha, at least you're honest about not having a well-informed opinion to base anything on beyond your personal bias'
t1_dtwl0mb	0	*	Isreal occupies and colonizes land that was Palestinian within living memory. It's not really an incursion when it's a conflict zone, if anything the Isrealis are the continued incursion.
t1_dtwoxwd	0	*	So the centrist party is like wearing a tuxedo t-shirt then huh? 
t1_dtwqndw	0	*	Neither does Bennett. Or Trump, for that matter.
t1_dtwvl7r	0	*	No, either one works.  You didn't fix anything.
t1_dtwn7ib	0	*	Their aim was to make it harder for Hamas militants to be in range of Israel. 
t1_dtxoxpy	1	*	He better start grooming his replacement soon. He can't live forever.
t1_dtwnfkt	0	*	You mean Hamas would drop bigger bombs on Israeli citizens?

t1_dtwxw1u	1	*	It's a meme my dude lol
t1_dtwno6e	0	*	So instead of a 'door knock', throwing a grenade through the window to warn that the house you're in is about to be a crater.
t1_dty0f08	1	*	But Bruges is in Belgium
t1_dtwo2rx	1	*	I think that both are really competent **at what they want to do**
t1_dtwlmqf	1	*	No, that's exactly their aim. 
t1_dtwvied	0	*	100% a troll, nobody is this fucking self-righteous.
t1_dtx6kyl	1	*	Yeah it was launched by Ugandan citzens

t1_dtwqgv5	0	*	Right wing: Small government! Left wing: Big government! Centrist: Government.
t1_dtwq90d	0	*	You scared?
t1_dtwux5a	0	*	South Africans deserve more respect for what they went through. Israel being apartheid is nothing more than a carefully crafted narrative that you've bought into. 
t1_dtwkwml	1	*	One too many questions. Take this enemy of the state away!
t1_dtwvpba	1	*	>Nobody deserves condescension, even misguided people.  That's one theory.
t1_dtwsy4m	0	*	It's the chocolate.
t1_dtwx8io	0	*	That is such a warped view of reality and literally the exact opposite of the truth based on revealed evidence
t1_dtwui4a	0	*	Sure, that's part of it. But don't forget: many Russians absolutely adored Stalin, too. And earnestly, not just because they were scared of him.
t1_dtx6u96	1	*	Yes but how does revolution start in the other Putin led country? 
t1_dtwlbi9	1	*	Because Trump claims Obama wiretapped him? So you have a link to something I could read?
t1_dtwnjbp	1	*	And, lets not forget, submitted and accepted as evidence in a FISA court. Despite what Nunes and FOX will tell you, thats actually a pretty high bar to clear. 
t1_dtwswnm	1	*	This made me laugh.
t1_dtwr0sk	1	*	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whataboutism

t1_dtwwjdn	0	*	You know, that is actually some sound advice.
t1_dtwxt6x	1	*	Its not as mind blowing once you really acknowledge how morally bankrupt he and his supporters are. There is no real conservatism, just hatred that he has cleverly harnessed for his own gain.
t1_dsrp4m8	1	*	Having a state would give credibility to actions. Right now they are captives of Israel. 
t1_dsqjv1v	1	*	But not really though.
t1_dsq6i9e	0	*	Are you saying American Jews don't have self-determination in the United States?
t1_dsq99s8	0	*	Lol what? You ever heard of the Etruscans or the Villanovans before them? That entire area has been inhabited since the days of the Neanderthal.  
t1_dsq7ipm	1	*	Are you Mizrahi?
t1_dsra1pd	1	*	> they're downvoted by either side though.  Probably why I don't see them then.
t1_dsqu6xe	0	*	Surely that doesnt justify calls for genocide and attacking civilians?
t1_dsqpylu	0	*	Gotta fill the cells, somehow. $$$$
t1_dsqvesv	1	*	Ask them did you mean to share it with (defendant)?
t1_dsramtf	1	*	A pity that doing their job fairly isn't a viable way to win votes
t1_dsqf3f3	1	*	having something that's difficult to prove is better than simply teeing everyone involved up on child porn charges 
t1_dsqcubl	1	*	I'm so sorry you had to waste your time and knowledge on such a fool. ... The issue sucks but clearly some people here are way overboard on both sides of the issue.
t1_dv3el98	1	*	Doesn't say anything about White Rhinos.
t1_dstv0om	1	*	Sure, that's is what they say. I'm simply pointing out that it's not a logical position. 
t1_dtks6qy	1	*	FWIENDS!!
t1_dtkdpyc	1	*	Youll have to further explain the *minority report shit* part of your comment. Nobody is being punished for a future crime, nor is anyone suggesting it.
t1_dtj9lch	0	*	Why are you talking about fairness when you're talking about the European Union? It is a continental protectionist trading bloc.
t1_dtkklos	0	*	>But let's maintain a system where migrants can more easily evade procedure, because otherwise that's racist
t1_du3nmn8	0	*	No thanks. I'll let you think what you want about me. It really doesn't matter.
t1_ds3b9ud	0	*	I never said some degree of authoritarianism isn't necessary, just don't think the trade off is worth it in this instance.
t1_ds3gffm	0	*	If someone is manipulated into committing an immoral act. You outlaw the act. Not the thought behind the act. The manipulated person is still a bad person... in reality... not in fantasy.
t1_dsgkugc	0	*	Funny. Trump waives punishment = permanent. Trump extends waiver is not permanent. Pretty obvious really. You keep choosing not to understand though. 
t1_dsgj149	0	*	It was the government who bailed them out with the expense of tax payers money and allowed the banks to give bonuses to the people who caused the crisis. It was not capitalism.
t1_dsh1mn1	1	*	Did you just repackage the same drivel from your last reply and post it here?
t1_dsgngqs	1	*	Yeah I remember when Obama tried to abolish Israel...
t1_dshbzhb	1	*	Reddit has a lot of disgusting subs that really shouldn't exist. Yet Reddit went after FPH... so weird.
t1_dsgq5gn	0	*	Oh no, i understand. I just think leaving them alone and defenseless (by dying) is *more* of a risk (and therefore less rewarding) than having yourself survive to continue looking for food elsewhere. 
t1_dsgr24s	0	*	Like which ones?
t1_dsi9nyz	1	*	Point being? You're not wrong, but I'm talking about the guy who has the big chair now.
t1_dsghzpm	0	*	Go find me a presidential candidate that doesn't support Israel.
t1_dsgjb6a	1	*	Obama didn't personally owe them billions. I'm not saying that his hands weren't dirty, but don't try to lay the blame on every single politician that has been in either of the major parties.
t1_dsgih5k	0	*	How did monopoly somehow develop these 'house rules' when the instructions literally came with the game?  And how come these house rules are consistent across america?

t1_dsgfuvo	0	*	Well then I don't even know how to play this stupid game then. Turns out all I know are house rules. People lose friends over this shit.

t1_dsguosx	0	*	B b b but Christian?, Jewish?  Didn't the Jewish religion murder Christ?  Why would his Christian fan base support Israel?
t1_dsh4fko	0	*	Interesting how a comment thread from ten hours ago suddenly got three downvotes. You must be upset. Downvote away dude. If I was here for internet points I'd bury my head in stubborn ignorance.

t1_dsgpjkt	1	*	He's obese.

t1_dsgjqtm	1	*	yup
t1_dsgl579	1	*	Because he said it and it fits their discourse.  That's literally all a lot of people seem to need.
t1_dsgiksw	0	*	Maybe they shouldn't be such thin skinned pussies then go on to complain about liberal snowflakes
t1_dsgug3g	0	*	It fairly obvious that he isn't worth a whole lot because if he really was worth billions he'd be plastering his tax returns on bill boards to show how rich he is.
t1_dsgvlmf	1	*	Well fuck, I guess I'll go jump off a cliff now. I don't think I can recover from  such a burn. 
t1_dsgu8v0	1	*	OK, I was actually wrong about this.

t1_dsh0svh	0	*	So they're bad because they're temporary and would be better if they didn't happen at all? Is that the best talking point Brock could come up with?
t1_dsgprzc	1	*	Which is bullshit 
t1_dshijhm	1	*	No hes hiding something. Why would the president care about someone like me? He said hes going to release them and here we are still waiting for them to be released.
t1_dsk9xkz	1	*	Like right away I'm down voted for saying that I don't agree ^^
t1_dsgpeqn	1	*	Edgy
t1_dsgxgay	0	*	You presented an opinion piece as evidence of truth to your point. I would imagine nearly 100% of americans believe our government is corrupt. By your own logic we must be more corrupt.
t1_dsi985q	0	*	Agreed-- it seems almost like a form of mental illness
t1_dsgtaxe	0	*	That, and he claims his property values to be unbelievable low for tax purposes.
t1_dsgpk00	1	*	 He's very legit, that's what makes this funny, and also pretty scary. 
t1_dsghye0	0	*	Ha! I love those Russia didn't give us Trump, Jesus did! memes on twitter. Cracks me up every time. Was Jesus on a coffee break the two times Obama was elected?
t1_dsgyzp7	0	*	Call me when they indict someone for something that has anything to do with trump 
t1_dshe5oe	1	*	oh dear god, thanks for the walking nightmares!
t1_dsgkdzf	1	*	How else should I take it? I was agreeing with you.
t1_dsi5ylu	1	*	Exactly. Taking risks should be expensive. 
t1_dsgwdj6	1	*	Oh of course, that's why there's no equivalency. As a left winger I'm just more personally familiar with the dark crevices of Tumblr/Twitter.
t1_dsgqt6n	1	*	Yeah that growth is definitely not cancer. These things never lead to anything. Right? 
t1_dsgqg6c	1	*	In my perfect world there is no competition and we all hold hands. Maybe sing tunes too.
t1_dsgr53m	0	*	But the closest economies (US, European Union) improved faster than Iceland. I agree that it felt good to imprison the people responsible for the crisis, but Iceland paid a big price for it.
t1_dsgv0ub	1	*	Cheat code, dye it back.
t1_dsgso95	1	*	DID I DO THAAAAAAAT?
t1_dsgw139	1	*	I once dreamt in a dream that I was thinking a thought.
t1_dsgwl05	1	*	4 million people tune into his podcast and they take it very seriously.... Absolutely terrifying...
t1_dshe6na	0	*	Thats exactly what theyre doing! Paul Ryan used social security to pay for his education, but now wants to get rid of it. Ridiculous.
t1_dsgk3d4	0	*	Rather not. They probably taste like burnt steak with ketchup. 
t1_dsgobpx	1	*	Lol why would you want to keep politics out of your marriage? Me and my wife know everything about each other, and our political beliefs certainly aren't gonna change our minds about each other

t1_dsgrtf7	1	*	Don't be fooled sheep! Bill Hicks faked his death, underwent plastic surgery, and is now who you believe to be Alex Jones!   Poor dupes 
t1_dut9rad	0	*	What I meant by biased is that MEMO say they only intend to push the Palestinian narrative. Not to only focus on Palestine.  I would quote it for you, but I'm on my phone atm.
t1_ducnz4r	1	*	that makes the most sense.
t1_ducw1mm	0	*	Well, not under this administration.
t1_dud7if2	0	*	My mistake, I edited my previous comment. Not gonna pretend to know what your life is like, but ill still stand by my statement that it is fucking disgusting to cheer the death of others.

t1_dse9r3j	1	*	Good point...probably should see if we can do an AMA for someone whose seen a CW5.
t1_dse6og1	0	*	Um NK has not had nukes since 2006. Otherwise all of Obama's sanctions we're for naught.

t1_dseid1m	0	*	Mk buddy. You keep having a brain.
t1_dseh1zg	0	*	>7x supports my argument even more.   I don't see how it does? Objectively the USA loses much more production with 1 million jobs than China does, and it's a larger portion of the population.

t1_dseg7so	1	*	Kushner is no Octavian.  I feel like it'd be more of a I found Washington a city of marble and left it a pile of bricks situation.
t1_dsegbf7	1	*	You're basically asking for the US to put its own allies in the crossfire, which is incredibly arrogant, and egocentric.
t1_dsebq5m	0	*	Okay well obviously this is a thought experiment to show a viewpoint, so saying that just defeats the whole purpose. Metaphors yo. 
t1_dum5pdx	1	*	Philosphy degree???  we are talking one class in ELEMENTARY logic.  We are not suggesting secondary school can give out PhD's
t1_dulc88k	0	*	Wrong, a few find it unteresting and they use it to make the world a better place for the fools who dont. 
t1_dulj7on	0	*	In other words: They essentially have no real content, just stories that can be used to justify anything you want.
t1_dulrlj8	0	*	Fair enough. What constitutes disproportionate in this case, though?
t1_dumi76n	0	*	Im not saying creationism or bleeding into other disciplines, thats rare, but focus on one religion depending on the school is the norm in religion classes
t1_dumi770	1	*	Underrated comment

t1_dse9wv4	1	*	He faked a coup to cement his support. I don't doubt he also fixes the elections. 
t1_dsdmhcg	1	*	You are absolutely right about that. Turkey is very unpopular lately and no one really sees them as a potential member. I just like to be optimistic. 
t1_dseis9x	0	*	Point taken. Have you read ink heart?
t1_dseytd5	0	*	No ofcourse not, but it's still better than an oppressive, unjust or enslaved life where you also run the risk of getting shot by some crazy person who disagrees with you
t1_dsdnf5w	1	*	Yup. Turkey joins Monday, we'd be drowning in kebabs Tuesday.  If you believed the campaigns.
t1_dshbrwx	1	*	It's mostly stone and concrete, what's your point?
t1_dsdoo2l	0	*	In history, that's what you'd call a conqueror overtaking a Republic.  It happened a lot.  It's not particularly new or unique to Star Wars. It's simply adapted to science fantasy.
t1_dsdwwqa	1	*	Whooooosh.
t1_dsedp0j	0	*	Oh I'm so offended by a post of random guy on reddit (joking here btw).

t1_dv2wqjr	1	*	No, the island that is now Haiti/Dominican Republic.
t1_dv2p0uu	1	*	It's ok. All those people that died in colonial grievances before the declaration of independence were British and then in a split second, everyone else became Americans. LOL.

t1_dsdscog	1	*	No, what I said was make fun because of hypocrisy. And it *is* a joke. It's both. These are not mutually exclusive, one could even say that joking is intimately connected to making fun of something.

t1_dtzpfwj	1	*	Its a solution to include North Korea, and the North Korean people!  The Olympics are in their backyard this year, and unity is what the Olympics are about.  
t1_dstqkd6	1	*	And it's such an odd argument because Italians brought it to NY and opened up shop. 
t1_dsu6a81	0	*	No one said anything about a utopian paradise. 
t1_dte9nmk	1	*	Absolutely right. If only that message could reach and echo in the hearts of those Taiwanese, who are afraid of doing anything. One day, it better, and hopefully, happen. 
t1_dsu55t5	1	*	Agreed, it's not news to NK that the US has a bigger nuclear stockpile  Also I'm pretty sure NK always offers an olive branch and then acts hostile a month later

t1_du9ekwf	0	*	In a lot of places like Texas and California its a weird thing just to have grass... needs too much water and is pretty much a waste of resources. Succulent lawns in CA are so pleasant!

t1_du9mqkg	1	*	Pro tip: If a country puts Democratic in their name, they probably aren't.
t1_dua9do2	1	*	If you dilute your piss with water it will not burn (nitrogen) the grass. That doesn't stop things from smelling like piss, but pissing outside shouldn't be a Who farted? situation to begin with. 
t1_du9h3nv	1	*	I pee outside in my backyard all the time at night when letting out the dogs. Just feel right and more natural than a toilet. 
t1_du9cnx9	1	*	Why exactly do you hate it so much? I've lived tons of different places including other metro areas and I loved minneapolis. I haven't heard many complaints about it.
t1_du9eaxp	1	*	bless

t1_du9flkj	1	*	If it's so dry they have to pee outside to conserve water, there's not enough water for bushes or grass.
t1_du9cky5	0	*	We have legalized bribery, which they all take part in. I'm unwilling to consider it un-corrupted just because they've made it legal. It also isn't a reason to discount all politics. That's just lazy.

t1_dswmslv	0	*	Well, the dude I replied to specifically said men, so.
t1_dzlzir4	1	*	You are correct. What point are you trying to make? It's a well built quadcopter that works in high wind. It has a tube that inflates when you drop it attached. 
t1_dsvdrzb	0	*	Without blinking is a figurative expression meaning hesitation, I wasn't being hyperbolic at all.  A wolf will absolutely kill you without hesitation, as will most natural predators.
t1_dsvkpx6	0	*	Can't my drones just drone over here immediately? If any product can ship itself...
t1_dsvn0pl	0	*	you seem very upset about some minor thing that doesn't influence anyone. semantics aren't even common sense.

t1_ds8lc3h	0	*	Those 6 other countries (not including NK for obvious reasons) are enough of a reason for russia to not use their nukes. You don't need over 8000 nukes to destroy one country.
t1_ds8055e	0	*	Case within point in point. We need Russia to maintain world order. And they need the US. No superpower will attack another because it hurts everyone

t1_ds84fje	1	*	Ah come on man. There's nothing wrong about being canadian. Instead of mass shooting we got maple syrup and mooses.
t1_ds872tr	0	*	So, we should have let the North Korean tanks mow down the South Koreans?

t1_ds82zhw	0	*	But what about Denouncing Venice?
t1_ds7rh24	1	*	What was your source on the 8 years number? Some weird right wing fringe news source? Just make it up? Just assume Obama didn't do anything so throw out the time period covering his presidency?

t1_ds81mn9	0	*	You should probably provide the correct translation if you're going to tell someone that they're wrong.
t1_ds8ekr3	0	*	My entire point was that claiming negotiations are a waste of time doesn't literally mean all negotiations are off the table but keep up the strawman if it makes you feel better.

t1_ds84ali	0	*	because Mexicans can't survive -30C here in Canada
t1_ds7v9ee	1	*	Is it a broken, oversized bridge with fast lanes for Russian made cars and a toll for poor people?
t1_ds7uxnt	0	*	Mobile plans are definitely worse, but no-limit internet for hard connections is pretty widespread. How much do you generally pay for no-limit internet in the US?
t1_ds8jsyy	1	*	Don't worry, you're racist in Canada too if you want to turn them away. God forbid we demand that they are vetted before we let them in as refugees.
t1_ds83nq5	1	*	Thats really silly. Youre silly. 
t1_ds83vij	0	*	A competent electronics engineer in a destabilized nation could reverse engineer an active nuclear warhead?  Ok.....
t1_ds9v7t9	0	*	So we could delay it another ten years? (Assuming theyd actually do that now, which they wouldnt) Great idea, let someone else deal with it.
t1_ds7w0y7	1	*	More expensive probably. We got them neutral nets though
t1_ds7xdx7	0	*	I'd love to see where the US has said they don't want good relations between NK and SK.  Do you even realize the mental gymnastics you're doing?
t1_ds81gz6	1	*	But you're pretty sure it'll just be kale chips.
t1_ds82jqh	1	*	Exactly  If I take steroids and just eat junk food all day without moving from my bed I'll still become a fat sob
t1_ds7ztie	0	*	I'm actually from Ukraine and I know both russian and ukrainian language. It has nothing to do with borderland, cause it is just not correct translation, so please stop using this as an argument.

t1_ds802y8	0	*	well I know all of that but you didn't answer my question as to what you would do in his position if you were born to a dictator?  Also doesn't Russia have the largest Nuclear arsenal in the world?
t1_ds7x2mj	0	*	As someone who lives in Russia, no, most Russians can't speak English, and the ones that do speak very broken English. Only a very small percentage can speak it well. 
t1_ds85vo2	0	*	The whole fucking UN was involved. It was one of the only successful things they did. You need to read more
t1_ds7wl2u	1	*	Well historically it did flank the entrance to the gulf of Mexico giving access to the Mississippi Delta. So Florida was strategically important. 
t1_ds7ux7z	0	*	Their press releases. I don't read opinions only source.
t1_ds7y9m2	0	*	And all our media reports on is aggressive rhetoric from Iran..
t1_ds8h8du	1	*	Lol he still hasn't. I really was curious where his bullshit 8 years of no talks came from. I'm guessing since he disappeared from the thread that he just completely made it up. 
t1_ds81e2k	0	*	Yes I agree. The point is that trumps actions so far havent proven to ease tensions but only dramatically increase them because as you say they have rushed to do more tests too quickly. 
t1_ds8399b	0	*	whataboutism.
t1_ds7vxek	1	*	>The media itself isn't retarded. Some of the stories they put out might be, but not the media itself.  But who is the hacker, 4chan?

t1_ds7xagd	0	*	In all honesty it seems like the only thing keeping Trump from doing these things is because of the system of law and he's surrounded by (mostly) relatively sane people. 
t1_ds8nrcm	1	*	When I mean't them I mean't Kim, and whoever else influenced nk to talk to sk. That is IF trump even had anything to do with it.

t1_ds7za3c	1	*	Buddy, it's always cold here. Its 6am and -35, but it'll probably warm up to -31 or so by mid day.   The funny part is that I'm in Ottawa and by no means the northern area of our country. 
t1_ds83otu	1	*	You simply adopted the cold...
t1_ds7vawc	1	*	Nope, just mobile (which is only bad because its expensive), our internet is just fine and net neutrality is, and always will be, a thing up here, eh there, bud.

t1_ds89fn3	0	*	See everything I've read makes it seem lile they're given a free house and a boatload of welfare money. It's good to know the legal system is actually working. 
t1_ds7vks4	1	*	Give him a break. Puberty is a tough time.
t1_ds822uk	1	*	Murdered by his younger brother.   Though to be fair he was an outspoken critic of the regime by then  There's another brother (Kim Jong-chul) who lives an ordinary life

t1_dsg6k2d	1	*	Negative.  I used to believe that until this administration.
t1_dsg6ocr	0	*	Cool
t1_dsg1233	0	*	It's kinda funny how the DNC told Bernie supporters their opinion didn't matter during the primaries but now blames the election solely on Bernie supporters. 
t1_dsg33zk	0	*	Ah right, Obama was so good at not bombing people huh?

t1_dsg9d49	1	*	Uh... They did that for One Belt and One Road. The reasoning is perfectly clear. You don't hear about One Belt and One Road much in American media, but it's a huge initiative by China right now.
t1_dsg40qb	1	*	I have no remorse.   Didn't vote for Trump.  Didn't vote for Hillary.  Edit: I voted for Gloria Riviera. Viva la revolucion!

t1_dsg9jap	0	*	Is it really hard to believe I outlasted a manager in a job? If you ever worked in the restaurant business youd know this isnt exactly something thats hard to do.
t1_dsi5fla	1	*	IMO, people who hoard money have the same disorder as the guy who lives in a house stuffed with newspapers up to the ceiling.  
t1_dsgzlqc	0	*	Sure, but Sessions won his last race with 99% of the vote. My point is even in as red as it gets Alabama, a Democrat was still able to eek out a win. 
t1_dsg3wir	0	*	I think youre missing the part where I replied two posts up to a person saying Putin is a global partner of the USA.   You know, before you and the other guy decided to white knight? 
t1_dsgked5	0	*	You're right. 7 more years of trump and a roaring economy.
t1_dsgdoig	1	*	On politics and so on? News, pics and other defaults come to mind. I didn't know that the reverse had happened on conspiracy

t1_dsg0idv	1	*	say what?
t1_dshsbs7	0	*	I like how you equate hugging your guns to female reproductive cycles. It's like your penis needs that extra girth so you can feel like women's health is a justified expense.
t1_dsgrk6x	1	*	He knew it was being rigged for his campaign. [He also suspected (projected?) that the democrats were trying to rig his rigged election.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJi6iV8yB74)
t1_dsg5g3i	0	*	Still the Obama administration could have controlled the Syria situation much earlier and better before the rise of ISIS. 
t1_dsi1r45	1	*	I skipped a few things. There was also some U0001f468ufe0f putting on U0001f525, U0001f62b for U0001f94ato make more U0001f4b0U0001f4b0U0001f4b0, but that's about the gist of it. 
t1_dsg6ps5	0	*	Do you have evidence of this? My gut tells me that Trump and his band of fools have galvanized non-conservatives into being more cohesive in the near future. 
t1_dsh32qm	1	*	Sure. It's a cheap trick for quick points.  The political version of moving to biweekly pay to make your books look good for a short time. 
t1_dsg6vld	1	*	Don't be ridiculous, everything we need to know comes directly from Trumps twitter.  /s, because I can't make it any more obvious.
t1_dsgbxgi	0	*	If they're anti-Clinton and sort of anti-Trump, that pretty much leaved Bernie. 
t1_dsg6zzu	1	*	I believe any claim no matter how outlandish as long as it coincides with my political views and anything which contradicts is #fakenews

t1_dt8eo6y	0	*	They are sitting on top of tens of billions of dollars worth of precious metals that they can't access due to lack of proper machinery and infrastructure.

t1_duyodd5	1	*	What are companies going to do?  Throw away all their euros?
t1_duxcifk	1	*	To be honest it surprised me too, I reckon it's for specific tax loophole reasons.   Possibly also worth noting is that 5000 people is about 0.2% of the working population of Ireland.
t1_dv2fj8i	0	*	Apple in Ireland employs people who otherwise would live in social housing? You don't think someone else could hire them? We're not talking about unqualified jobs here.

t1_duxhqxr	0	*	There is no uniformity in EU tax corporate tax rates. [It runs the gamut between 9 and 35%, and Ireland is in the middle with rates of 12.5% to 25%.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_rates_in_Europe)
t1_duxjj0j	1	*	Low corporation tax isnt illegal, just unethical, Apple has a unique deal where they paid a special rate. 
t1_duwrku7	0	*	Right. Thats just a policy any country could implement. Whats your point?   That doesnt make corporation tax useless income for ireland just because they could replace it with higher taxes elsewhere. 
t1_duwvevr	1	*	Yeah, but U balls.

t1_du7591e	0	*	Yes, do ignore the fact youre the one to make personal attacks. Definitely makes me inclined to take anything else you write seriously.
t1_duxiq3v	1	*	No one really. I'd say CPC is right of centre, but not by much. They are hardly a right wing party.

t1_du7lfqu	1	*	Indeed, things were pretty bad for black or colored individuals in apartheid.
t1_du6tn31	1	*	You can't compare a country from today to one in the 1600s, is what I'm saying.
t1_du6qxg9	0	*	So it wasn't cultural genocide when the apartheid government mandated all children learn in Afrikans?
t1_du6jde3	0	*	It should go back to the people it was taken from. The Apartheid government was still confiscating land well into the 1980s.

t1_ds9pyob	0	*	Yes, but the point is about how the companies charge you to use their networks. i.e can you just buy $10 credit from a company with a free sim or do you need to sign up for 12months etc.
t1_ds9x9kw	1	*	It means they cannot access any data on your device.

t1_du3nzd5	1	*	Ironically you can pay for almost anything in Iran (hotels, busses, restaurants, tours) with U.S. dollars. Wouldnt call that a tourist area, but whatever. 
t1_du4kgwd	0	*	I'm personally of the opinion that bitcoin is an investment bubble and that cryptocurrencies in general are either pointless at best or scams that target gullible people at worst. Remember bitconnect?
t1_du49pwp	1	*	Many businesses don't take credit, can easily give momey to friends / family / anyone, guaranteed to work, can't be frozen by a bank due to various reasons. 
t1_du6wrfn	0	*	And the rest?  Some concrete examples of what crypto gives to the every-day consumer? 
t1_du5fjke	1	*	People in china and india are to blame for a lot of the globes environmental issues. That has nothing to do with blockchain.
t1_du41mnj	0	*	So were beanie babies. So are lawnmowers, in this hypothetical.  It's a classic bubble, and if you're investing in bitcoin you're an idiot.
t1_du3v0bl	0	*	I already don't get annoyed by ads, since I block them. I make a living working with distributed systems- blockchains are overhyped.
t1_du4m2m3	1	*	You must feel angry or upset about something to talk to a stranger that way.  I hope you learn to cope with whatever is bothering you.
t1_du4x0u8	1	*	I'm fine with working with a 3rd party.
t1_du4eyho	1	*	just to add: the classical way to opt out on currency and hedge against a meltdown is gold. 
t1_du3x2e9	1	*	Lol and people trust this guy with their money. I guess anyone can get into that business.
t1_du4x0is	1	*	But space is a lie that NASA invented, amirite?

t1_dumyl9v	0	*	Best moment of my life, watching a military band play that song in full uniform (in a non-public venue).  I laughed and laughed and laughed. I still do.
t1_dupctm5	1	*	It really isn't complicated nor an accident that the wealth disparity has widened exponentially while real wages for the middle class and poor have been stagnant since the 80s lol
t1_dun0vcz	1	*	But only one of the parties nominated someone who, by any available metric, was utterly unqualified to hold the position. Both sides are not the same and never were.
t1_dun43kr	1	*	Which part?
t1_dun1sfg	0	*	I mean, if she won what would they have done? Invaded? It's not a zero sum game. You don't have to win every battle, just the war.

t1_duni151	1	*	And same to you.
t1_dunyof0	1	*	Is this an evolution of liberals are the *real* racists? Yeah, everyone crowing about Russian involvement are now the *real* Russian agents.
t1_dumptto	1	*	I also think a big part of it was Trump signing sanctions into law and then not following trough.   Edit: from what Im seeing he never implemented them the 29th was the deadline.  
t1_dumy8wu	0	*	Sad about what? 
t1_dup4prj	0	*	TIL Hillary is Bernie and Jill too
t1_dunhaib	1	*	He was a comunity organizer and was arguably more effective in that role than as senator. A comunity organizer is a good thing. A wanabe construction mogul turned reality tv host is not.

t1_dundvn5	1	*	After all, they have destroyed Hitler's own bomber already, that's an accomplishment  https://vimeo.com/152131584  
t1_dup8ziw	1	*	Ahhh i see.
t1_dun21hh	1	*	Agreed. Hyperpartisanship has been bubbling up for over a decade but it exploded in 2016. I don't know how we fix it but it's terrible for the country.
t1_dun2f1l	1	*	Confirmation bias.

t1_dumyk20	0	*	everyone should be more aware when they are parachuting
t1_ductwqi	0	*	Have you tried Coke Zero? Slightly different taste to Diet Coke. Much less plasticy IMO and tastes much better.
t1_dud227v	1	*	We don't know that for sure, and people are generally super bad at moderating themselves anyway.
t1_dudvej2	1	*	I presume most people would answer Italy first
t1_dudaw2n	1	*	Go Pepsi Max.  Easily the best sugarless coke alternative, and in fact it's so good I these days actively prefer it to coke, sugar aside. 
t1_ducyijs	0	*	We recently got a new no sugar coke in Australia called Coke No Sugar its supposed to replace coke zero and it tastes extremely close to normal coke.
t1_dudaxgt	1	*	I should have put a sarcastic tag on that comment I made.    My intention was to joke about comparing eating candy to alcohol consumption.
t1_dudcksy	1	*	Maybe very few of them. Per serving, most energy drinks have about as much caffeine as a cup of coffee, or less.
t1_dud7yri	1	*	It does. Maybe things are different elsewhere. Turns out probably not.
t1_dud4ner	0	*	A rockstar or monster is a quid for 500ml, coffee is at the best xa32.50 for around 300ml, the yank is a prick for free.
t1_ducxzzq	1	*	You're right.  Regular Coke tastes like straight corn syrup to me now.  I can't stand it...
t1_dudnhck	1	*	Tastes a hell of a lot better than type 2 diabetes.
t1_ducrntm	1	*	This also specific stores and not the government's doing.
t1_dud6tgl	1	*	Actually it doesn't. 
t1_dsbwrd0	1	*	Those probably wont work either
t1_dsc1f1c	0	*	Because this is under the context of the comment discussing whether or not learning English long term is good for a country
t1_dsctw29	1	*	You can visit Muslim, Christian, Jewish and Zoroastrian houses of worship in Tehran. So yes, yes you can. 
t1_dscmc16	1	*	You're as lovely as your username

t1_dsc9ay3	1	*	Well, Cantonese is still very much in the minority but there are definitely enough regional dialects that no one should expect to be understood in official Mandarin throughout China.

t1_dsdgjen	1	*	i thought it was 16 people 
t1_dsctco4	0	*	I am not saying it is religion. I am giving you an example of how Christians in different countries can do the same shit as Muslims. Therefore religion is not the explanation, it's poverty.
t1_dsnw8ge	1	*	Engineers are disproportionately prone to radicalisation. Education isn't a panacea.
t1_dsmyy3n	1	*	I'm sorry that you interpret my comments that way. I will not engage in that deflecting argument, though. 
t1_dsn8dce	0	*	You support deportation of WW2 veterans. Shame shame shame. 
t1_dsn3bvz	1	*	We'll see if he gets caught in the end. As it stands, he's either the world's greatest conman, or the world's worst under the thumb of the world's best.
t1_dsnjnyf	1	*	I'm not saying they should get credit, but on the same token we should focus on the horrendous things that are in the bill that they passed and not on stuff that wasn't.
t1_dsn3znb	0	*	Citations?

t1_dsn44jv	0	*	Alabama, but I dont see the Trumpers calling to kick them out of the country...
t1_dubg0uv	1	*	I believe they're making both. Separate teams though. Regardless, it will very likely be a huge resurgence for this old game and it'll be great for both.
t1_duajtuc	1	*	I couldn't remember entirely so I just went with cousin
t1_dubnio2	1	*	I mean chasing away raiders in exchange for free stuff is basically what ruling is.

t1_duaig8p	1	*	How will I recover? 
t1_duakaqr	1	*	Yeah, it's pretty fucked up. Not only was it an assassination but those 2 girls had to be treated as well.
t1_duc8gbz	1	*	Sure!
t1_dubcihh	1	*	There's a Maze Runner graffiti ad still up near the Shoreditch boxpark. Don't know how that's survived so long

t1_du2o9i5	0	*	Was that supposed to be an insult? Because it was pretty pathetic, to be honest.
t1_du2rx19	1	*	Sounds like she just comes from a culture that puts effort into the way they're put together. 
t1_du41bai	1	*	She may be, but in that part of Europe, women spend an hour in the bathroom before going out. Seeing those that don't, yeah, it's shocking.
t1_du2tp3a	1	*	Almost all public schools and private schools in New Zealand and Australia not to mention lots of other countries has compulsory school uniforms. Each school usually has its own distinct uniform.
t1_du2uva3	1	*	Oh man get one that is tailored to your exact sizes it's magical. I guess you are right though every man that was an over exaggeration 
t1_du2u6pv	1	*	A lot of large and inner city public schools in the US have strict dress codes that are basically uniforms. Mine adopted them in the early 2000s
t1_du3dpnl	1	*	Suits are fine. Fuck ties. Fuck having to button up to the collar.
t1_du2tozp	1	*	I've heard a lot of people saying they've been going down in quality the last few years. 
t1_du221yf	1	*	Ya, I just looked this up and I had no idea how prevalent this was in some areas.
t1_du25f1g	0	*	> No bandaids under the eyes  Sooo I'm guessing this means literally right under the eyes and not the way I took it (bandaids not allowed unless applied directly to the forehead)
t1_du29i2d	0	*	All the highschools in my area have polo/khaki dresscode. American south.
t1_du2rjey	1	*	I have Levis jeans that I've used for more than 10 years. Definitely not trash. 
t1_du2kue5	0	*	It may not count as high end but my Jag has been as reliable as any other car I've owned, and it makes me *feel* way better than any car I've owned.
t1_du2gi47	1	*	In the US its not unheard of   But its far more likely that the school has a dress code over a uniform 
t1_du3wkd9	1	*	That sounds interesting.  Are you with the construction company or client?  
t1_du6axbn	0	*	Yup as i said you are more knowledgeable then all those Professionals.
t1_du899zg	0	*	Apologist number 8,953 trots out the 'you-don't-understand-the-context' and 'it's-been-debunked' chestnuts.   What is the scholarly interpretation of ***strike her***?
t1_du6idke	0	*	O Jesus. You're concerned about the term warlord and totally cool with the other part. That tells me all I need to know about you. 
t1_du6n1zz	0	*	>Hyperbole: exaggerated statements or claims not meant to be taken literally.  ?
t1_du6kjsm	1	*	Well most of the weird bits of all the Abrahamic religions are to do with ritual cleanliness. Foods to eat, etc - depending on how seriously you take the old testament this also applies to Christians.

t1_dtfyxur	1	*	We could also get another Roosevelt out of it too, though. Hopefully.
t1_dtfisqc	0	*	It sounded like it. Eugh.   I grew up in a farm town. Country folks are lovely. Rednecks blow chunks. 
t1_dtgx9ae	0	*	Greece was already in crisis. In a healthy, functioning economy it's not a good thing when the value of your currency falls. Period. Full stop.
t1_dtf94ov	0	*	They said mean things about ape man Beanie sanders!! rigged!!
t1_dtfmpky	1	*	Just a theory. Im very likely to be wrong so Im not going to pretend that its a fact but I am allowed to speculate based on my opinion 
t1_dtgpwhj	1	*	Well, we do like our cheese here in California. And our population in this state alone is larger than Canada. Hell, the county of LA has a larger population than most states. 
t1_dtfx1lc	1	*	Boy you have been bitchslapped again and again yetr here you are again doubling down on your lies.  Seiously, stop it! 
t1_dthz9b9	1	*	I guess you are not the type to let reality have an impact on your opinions.  
t1_dtfu134	1	*	Hillary wouldn't be tweeting world leaders provoking shit.   But yes, we have different opinions but I do enjoy that we had a discussion and it was pleasant. Have a wonderful week. 
t1_dtsq4e9	0	*	Yup, they do. That doesn't change the fact that 99% of the people being called 'alt-right' or 'nazi' (nowadays a synonym) are in fact, neither of those things.
t1_dtsq3cm	0	*	Why wouldn't there be bias against a dictator? Putin. Tell me honestly. Russians barely know better due to censoring and such.
t1_dtss50p	0	*	Possibly one that is interested in the well-being of the people over it's own power (which is what a democratic government should be)?
t1_dttcpqt	1	*	That is how it works since you will be held in a local jail/holding cell after being arrested but before being charged.  However I misread the original post here, so my bad.
t1_dtssmlw	0	*	Hate speech has those ramifications and more. And also hate speech are also generally lies. Which is defamation. So theyre very related.
t1_dtssj3j	0	*	Doesn't have to be a bot to be a troll. I'd say he/she just communicated improperly. Cog in the Russian propaganda machine, machine or otherwise, is more what he was saying.
t1_dttt8d4	0	*	Yeah, they may not be in jail, but they do get to experience the financial hardship of  job hunting with a criminal record for the rest of their life. 
t1_dtvwp0s	1	*	/s
t1_dtspqav	1	*	Care to explain how there isn't a difference? I want to argue this with you but I would like to see your full argument before responding. 
t1_dtso63h	1	*	To be fair I am only aware of it because of Family Guy.
t1_dtsuuja	0	*	Australia, where hate speech is illegal. So far no neonazi hate rallies.
t1_dtsmjx4	0	*	It's not called that pre-sentence, you say he's in custody or something...
t1_dtsnw4c	1	*	Not really. Thats called defamation.
t1_dtsumd6	1	*	Anyone on reddit that disagrees with my politics is a Russian agent.
t1_dtsp4x7	0	*	Sure.  And then they're free to sue the slanderer for defamation of character and damages resulting from the destruction of their reputation.
t1_dtsr7zg	0	*	You really made a point with your insults, those words really invalidated my argument. I have no argument agaisnt your argument.
t1_dtsq245	0	*	That was one idiot, unless you're referring to the Muslim attackers?
t1_dtsursn	0	*	This isn't a case of oh but both sides might have merits. Nazis campaign for the establishment of a white-centric facist autocracy through genocide. Non-nazis don't. Nazis are garbage.
t1_dtsqpj9	0	*	That's why its for the courts to decide how much was a joke ? and not the internet? hence he's not been convicted... 
t1_dtsnth4	0	*	So you agree there's a line right? you agree there's a line to what you can and cannot do online? good. We established that.
t1_dtsrybd	0	*	This is some backwards bending hyperbolic bullshit if I've ever seen it.
t1_dtte7k0	1	*	Alcohol is banned in America. They make you show your ID and everything.   Also flying. Banned.  
t1_dtsoe4m	1	*	sorry mate, i'm usually not in a very jokey mood when it comes to threads like this.

t1_dtso8ef	0	*	>he was punished  Where is his conviction? he's making youtube videos even now... 
t1_dtsqxgx	0	*	Yeah I totally misread your comment. Sorry 'bout that.
t1_dtsrwcy	0	*	That's not how this works. If someone makes a claim, it's their responsibility to provide evidence backing up that claim.   /u/Rottimer is not required to provide evidence for conjecture. 
t1_dttfna0	1	*	Except they're usually none of those things.
t1_dtsu2fo	1	*	No, I'm Spartacus!
t1_dtsrgg8	1	*	You're dumb as hell niqqa
t1_dtsoo6m	1	*	No, it's because they don't believe what nazis believe.
t1_dtsynsk	1	*	Depends on the consequences - they have as much right to the protection of the law as anyone else. Violence & harassment are criminal conduct, even if the victim is a hateful little toad. 
t1_dtsrb38	0	*	Im not sure how UKs law actually reads with the whole policing the internet law works, but I agree they are similar in principle.
t1_dtsn1m4	1	*	And i raaaaaaannnnn
t1_dtsrom8	0	*	Unless it's again the right wing, then I don't care 
t1_dtsrl80	1	*	Usually I think the /s tag is stupid, but in this case I think you've proved it has some merits.
t1_dtt0n1q	0	*	Next thing, they'll be allowing citizens the right to bear arms to overthrow a tyrannical government. 
t1_dtu0884	0	*	Thank you for proving his point.
t1_dtsr1m2	0	*	Not really. If a law only negatively affects Nazis or people acting like Nazis it's a pretty good law
t1_dttcpvq	1	*	Sorry, I misread.
t1_dtslnra	0	*	No, its a good thing that we have a system in place and that keeps police abuse in check (were only talking about this particular issue, here).  
t1_dtspvys	0	*	Which is why inciting violence is not okay in the UK or the US, you can't say let's go kill all the muslims either, or shall we gas the jews, it's a very simple concept
t1_dtsqosi	0	*	So do I. That doesn't take away that 99% of the people being called Nazis are not Nazis.
t1_dsi1pws	1	*	You spelled ignorant wrong...
t1_du5ij5w	0	*	> And last, we come to Chomsky, perhaps one of the most famous Soviet apologists still alive  Uh, what? I think you're confused.
t1_dumxz2v	0	*	Yeah USA is not a dictatorship, it is a democracy which fails to protect its kids... one more time, news and stats prove it
t1_duou524	1	*	I respect your ability to care less if you wanted, but choose not to.
t1_dtn1t69	0	*	I guess the point that matters is how do you define it less true are there lies in the memo? Has anyone called them out?
t1_dtna1cm	0	*	Didn't show up in any Google results.
t1_dtn052o	0	*	His background has nothing to do with the access to information his position gets him. Attacking his education seems a weird way to show contempt. 
t1_dtsjwdl	0	*	I realize Law & Order makes it seem like they slap the cuffs on the suspect as soon as they find evidence, but in *real life* investigations take years.
t1_dtn8q03	1	*	I agree.
t1_dtn4oux	0	*	Why would Steele continue his research after Clinton lost? He got paid even if he came up with nothing. Steele has credibility, unlike Nunes. 
t1_dtn2w1v	0	*	How could Schiff have access to it without the chairman having access to it? Im going to assume its part off seperate committee?
t1_dtn2vhh	0	*	>Hey man, I don't believe the only proof that's come out about this.  Give me better proof!  You sound like you're unapologetically straight out of T_D.
t1_dtn4syt	1	*	I can agree that sucks. Would go a long way to prove their side of the side is correct.
t1_dtn7bdk	0	*	It's ok. None of this is easy to understand. Probably on purpose. I really do wish we could understand exactly what happen here some day. Unlikely though. 
t1_dtn4g8m	0	*	I like to post in multiple different areas of reddit and don't mind leaving the conservative corners. I'll be posting in multiple threads about this topic across reddit! :)
t1_dullbj7	0	*	You suck 
t1_dulllcm	0	*	> Motivated by which beliefs?   Infidels, martyrdom, caliphate, etc.  Again, just because you don't agree that Allah rewards jihadists for killing infidels doesn't mean he didn't believe that. 
t1_dulkd8m	0	*	Do you live here? Do you know how our everyday lives are? No? Then you shouldn't try to teach a swede how things are for them.
t1_dulkv5r	1	*	As far as the talks I've had with extremists on any side: Young, angry people will flock together and hate together if given a target that does not look/sound/smell like them.

t1_dt6fdoz	0	*	Found the German troll!  Jk, but seriously lay off Pussy Riot. If they weren't effective the Russian government wouldn't have arrested some of them, right?
t1_dt6sau6	0	*	More just mocking the transparent lol Reddit libruls joke the original commenter was trying to make.   Take it as you will. 
t1_dt6qh2v	0	*	Swearing after a rebuttal; classic troll.

t1_dt6sgte	1	*	oh come on everyone knows you're just trying to stoke the fires of the old Cola Wars :P
t1_dsao6p4	1	*	Your not allowed to heal the sick anymore without being a registered nurse or doctor.
t1_dsalfa9	0	*	Which does not correlate with original op's idea being a failure.  Though I do agree doing nothing doesnt exactly help solve the problem at hand.
t1_dsauwr7	0	*	I dunno. Skroob/Helmet 2020 is sounding better and better.
t1_dsdy2fi	0	*	That took you a day to think up. All you can think of is a couple lame insults. Boring person. Needs to resort to ambiguous personal attacks. 
t1_dsaoz4s	0	*	The idea is corrupt 60+ year olds will be dead before any negative repercussions happen from their bad policies. 
t1_dsaha7s	1	*	Time to invest in a classic now then chaps.
t1_dsaenjt	1	*	Exactly what I was gonna say.U beat me to it thank you 
t1_dsaevjp	0	*	No he isnt. Reread your comment and then show me where you make a valid argument and not just a pointless personal attack
t1_dsan6yi	1	*	Yup, I love the backstory. 
t1_dsass3e	1	*	Exactly. Pretty much every distance job becomes much more efficient and easier with a smartphone (in that case, any mean of instant communication).
t1_dsag3l4	0	*	Why not? Id be willing to go to a dangerous protest if I thought it would give the world a better future. 
t1_dsakp7b	1	*	If thats the case, then I stand corrected.
t1_dsabnfc	0	*	This unfortunately is absolutely fucking true. 
t1_dsb8c66	1	*	That could be either
t1_dsaoyvq	0	*	Snow in central and South Texas too.  I live in an area that on several occasions the last 3 years has had 12 or more inches of rain in a 24hr period as well as intense wind.
t1_dsarxye	0	*	Really needed you to clip in fat Matt damon, not sure what his name is actually.
t1_dsaexms	0	*	Oh I have every intention of doing something, but it sure as shit won't include the far left.
t1_dsaesw5	0	*	The democrats have little to offer either. Get your partisan bullshit out of this discussion. It's the us vs them mentality that fuels all this bullshit. 
t1_dsbjpgv	1	*	bacon tastes great and my ancestors agree.  checkmate, vegan
t1_dsan4l4	0	*	Hi I'm a random doctor off the street and if I'm limited at 60k I'll switch careers.
t1_dsapbxt	0	*	That's the point. The US economy is a garbage speculation racket.      I dream bigger.
t1_dsay0if	0	*	I think maybe you missed my point. I'm not saying there won't be plebs anymore. I'm saying any hope for the plebs to advance and strive for a better society (whatever that means) will be over.
t1_dsax64i	0	*	Go to r/neutralpolitics  The op explaination is garbage
t1_dsaq6tx	1	*	Jesus Christ, it's Jason Bourne.
t1_dsap1gw	0	*	Nope :( Acidification, amongst other things, is resulting in die-off. Warming temps isnt reversing or canceling that out.
t1_dsan0o5	1	*	Well which country is full of climate change deniers up to the highest level of government and pulling out of global agreements against other countries' wishes? 
t1_dsaugq5	1	*	Schooner or later, you'll find out
t1_dsbsxae	0	*	I wouldn't say a eugenics message is great for a comedy either, yet that's where Idiocracy kind of went with it.
t1_dsbebzz	1	*	yeah we had a storm last week and this week the rivers are swelling due to heavy rainfal luckily the dutch governemnet is completely prepared for this and no issues are expected
t1_dsaipbc	0	*	But he's one of the super rich
t1_dsi6slx	0	*	And yours I bet is straight from the NewyorkTimes, Buzzfeed, WashingtonPost, CNN, and HuffingtonPost... and their even moreso exposed massive swathe of bullshit.
t1_dsbt4k0	0	*	The poor also don't have much power to change what is making things collapse. Blaming the disenfranchised and oppressed seems pretty wrongheaded and is just plain incorrect.
t1_dsardk2	0	*	Get some help, dude. 
t1_dsarmdn	0	*	There's physically almost nothing they can do. They can't sway US politics in any meaningful way mostly 
t1_dsam47k	1	*	Neoliberal fanboys actually strongly believe this, yeah. Kinda sad when you think about it.
t1_dsajk7f	1	*	That's not spending tho. That's investing. 
t1_dsayaw1	1	*	That's a deliberate move on the part of the elite. 
t1_dsayc2e	1	*	Prepared for the Future!  -the 1%
t1_dscht7c	1	*	Thank you.
t1_dsamwkz	1	*	My vote goes to Tank Girl
t1_dsazk3e	1	*	It will all balance out. Half of our major cities drowned = CO2 emissions reduced by half!
t1_dsajzj7	1	*	exactly 
t1_dsao2dv	0	*	I'm not a denier. That's a political term, not a scientific one. So now I know exactly what you are. What's your degree in, anyway? Fashion studies? Theater? Art history?
t1_dsauisg	1	*	Unfortunately we also have capitalism. It demands constant growth not to collapse under its own weight, and growth demands exploiting the cheapest available alternatives.
t1_dsaueas	1	*	Or when it's 70 degrees in January.
t1_dsaqj2x	0	*	Thank you! That was very sweet, and quite helpful. Hope you have a fabulous weekend-

t1_dtyyf6t	1	*	Then they shall go out of business because they refuse to adapt and change. 
t1_duvu65x	0	*	It's strictly a what if situation. Basically, what would a dictatorship need to offer to the average person to choose to live there.
t1_duv69vg	1	*	Many more examples that show than success. 
t1_duv3rp4	1	*	There's always a technicality that keeps what he's doing from being illegal but still disgusting.
t1_duv3xnd	1	*	You mean like spying and meddling in foreign governments?  The moment you don't do these things you end up like Qing Dynasty China.
t1_duvylcf	1	*	Exactly that, the role of a president in America changed drastically after the new Deal. While it didn't add any new explicit powers, the role of presidents prior and after were certainly different
t1_duvy7iy	1	*	Hold my... wait, what now?
t1_duv4ukg	1	*	Both the signing of and rescinding of the magna carta comes to mind.

t1_duxbp77	1	*	/s? 
t1_duxcxre	1	*	Not true, he apologized directly to Park Geun Hye.  Korea agreed that the matter was finally and irreversibly settled.
t1_duyuj4n	0	*	We invented it, and you use it like no tomorrow. I don't believe a bit that you were a soldier, but if you were, you probably were discharged for assaulting civilians. 
t1_duxdjv2	0	*	Lol must be a troll
t1_duxfuhn	1	*	So use it. Ive seen people legitimately make that exact same argument you passed off as sarcasm. 
t1_duxfh0k	0	*	I don't know, but an invasion wasn't the only option.  There were American admirals arguing for a blockade and conventional bombing.
t1_dv24ob1	0	*	You are talking about numbers, im talking about subjective experience of death.   Please, go do both and tell me which sucks worse. 
t1_duyxi61	1	*	No, I don't think we can.   Actually, if you look at Chinese history you can see we were doing the same things the Japanese did to us to our own countrymen for thousands of years. 
t1_duypn13	1	*	Well,lets agree to disagree then. It was nice to doubt my own thoughts and knowledge. Hope you have a good day/night,and thanks for the conversation.

t1_dsfobb0	0	*	They still test for doping in the olympics.
t1_dsfk2aj	0	*	We really don't. If we did, someone would've launched a nuke already.  I do fear that I'll live to see the second war in history where nukes are launched, though.
t1_dsgngsa	1	*	They have drug tests before Olympics.
t1_dsfdtc2	0	*	I only know  in my whole life. Is there any other name for Ping Pong in Chinese?

t1_dsfo2j9	0	*	As a Canadian Canadian, I want another Canadian NHL team.
t1_dsfpsb8	1	*	We'll even give them a handicap. The other countries can ban out top 18 picks and we'll choose from the next best 18.
t1_dsffwwt	1	*	The US? Probably not.   The US Military-industrial complex which is the biggest donor to US politicians? They pop boners at the thought of a major war happening. 
t1_dsfp1ir	1	*	Clinton boom lead to the 01 bust and Obama did jacked shit except jerked off with the media 24/7. 
t1_dsfj1uu	1	*	Sizzurp? 
t1_dsfkjgo	0	*	Nah, I think Football = Football
t1_dsfk7z7	0	*	I just think typing soccer and football is easier than adding a countries name before football in both cases. 
t1_dsfazh3	1	*	Ok Trump is a draft dodger what is your point?
t1_dsffnd7	1	*	you're right, nobody wants it.  NK is the 3 yr old throwing a tantrum to get what it wants.  I truly hope that no one wants war.  It's pointless bloodshed.
t1_dsfuphm	1	*	Oh no people like an entertaining and engaging sport that has a lot of strategy behind it. I play league and tyler1 is hilarious but I have no idea why youre so triggered 
t1_dsilxfa	0	*	to answer your first question, since they were human and were able to, and because people aren't cruel.  and sanctions against north korea have only been in place since the early 1990s.
t1_dsfqu0f	1	*	SUBSCRIBE to radiation facts!
t1_dsflq8r	1	*	Lol my vote is for Handegg.
t1_dsff8sc	1	*	It's good for the weapon industry.
t1_dsfvk61	0	*	After some searching, I think it means Very Stable Genius, a reference to a recent Trump tweet. I'm not sure if the use is intended to be mocking or genuine.
t1_dsg6osu	1	*	Here's a tip, just stick to the facts.
t1_dsfq3h8	0	*	Those ones in Yankee Stadium look comfy as hell, wish we had those where Im from. cheers for that!

t1_dsfm8ag	0	*	Why do you think they make these big shows of aggression every couple of years?
t1_dsfry4v	0	*	Just another cog in the cold war era propaganda machine, eh
t1_dsfofw5	1	*	Aye me too, doesn't sound too great. but it's hardly north korea dude
t1_dsfv6v0	1	*	So does that mean he is actually puck shaped rather than spherical?
t1_dsfogsn	1	*	Great fucking start to 2018.
t1_dsfec99	0	*	You mean to tell me that the two sports had wordy, confusing names and a new system was devised to differentiate them? 
t1_dsfgzg4	1	*	Or just a straight-up invasion. *looks at Iraq*
t1_dsfvsva	0	*	 No,  because the things Hillary was for screw a lot of working class and they're tired of it.  They're so tired of it,  they're willing to vote for Donald Trump.  
t1_dsfggxi	0	*	Messy as it is, China is actually helping in keeping the peace. Guess we owe it to them.
t1_dsg1gxi	0	*	When push comes to shove China isn't going to support North Korea. They will be there for the spoils of war though.
t1_dsh4ag0	1	*	I'm knew it from... Hi, I'm Matt
t1_dsg860q	1	*	That sounds like a reasonable assessment to me.
t1_dsffyc6	0	*	Be the first country in your region to get a big red button. 
t1_dsfk9gv	0	*	I wasn't talking about them going to actual war, more about China being all, Wait, don't do that if the US does move military near their border
t1_dsh4nmr	1	*	Was Kim Jong there?
t1_dsfi3ng	1	*	Oh for sure. We won't be safe in out basement bomb shelter anymore. It's not as easy as it used to be
t1_dsfovck	0	*	Hit me with another
t1_dsfgqlo	1	*	I downloaded the whole of reddit and I'm still getting a 503 error.
t1_dsft3fy	1	*	Curious to know how you know this? Did you receive poor treatment there? Do you think the WHO manipulates data? 
t1_dsfwju6	1	*	Yeah I'd like one too. Literally all I know about Nixon is from the Oscars musical with Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway.
t1_dsff4mi	0	*	*rugby-for-pussies
t1_dsfhnjo	0	*	Table soccer
t1_dsfvdnp	1	*	Yeah now that I think about it, are there any characters that are actually pong?

t1_dsffe5l	1	*	Trump administration makes no sense.
t1_dsfxf5g	0	*	Yeah, re-read it with the context fam ... you are reaching.
t1_dsgjpiv	1	*	they do see it, otherwise they'd be eating grass again like they were a decade or so ago when we stopped giving them aide. they might not see all of it, but they do see it.
t1_dsfoerm	1	*	yes, and the rest runs clean. unfair
t1_dsfj2t2	0	*	Ah I see, this is odd - but it seems you accidentally responded to wrong comment, as my comment made no claim about the significance of this event. Glad I could clear this up. 
t1_dsfhi0l	0	*	They started the Korean War though. The US didn't even intervene until the UN had passed resolution 83.
t1_dsfy7i7	0	*	I've never said or thought that. Stuff like this further increases the divide in this country. Both sides are guilty of this immature bullshit and it disgusts me. 
t1_dsgjjxu	1	*	Not quite as absurd as your mental gymnastics.
t1_dsgrl0o	1	*	Youre confused. Those are just apes fighting for their freedom 
t1_dsfgfp5	1	*	actually US is very bad and will likely ruin everything, as they always do, unlike my country, very proud people, thanks
t1_dsfh92v	1	*	If they were really hell bent on hitting something then that would make sense for them to target Guam first.  Except that will most definitely be the last missile NK ever fires again..
t1_dsfq5tf	1	*	Always struck me as more of an orange soda guy
t1_dsfy2j8	1	*	post-truth, post-MADness, we keep talking about how this is the post-everything world, we might as well start calling it the post-world-world.
t1_dsfggj4	0	*	Yes they do. https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-life-and-hard-times-of-the-family-a-cuban-defector-left-behind
t1_dsffo6w	0	*	I don't want to call you stupid...But you are making it hard. You are acting the like the billionaires aren't doing irrational self servitude by fucking over the middle class. 
t1_dsflaye	1	*	And I agree with you. Yet calling someone out on their hyperbole and lack of elegance is worth the snide retorts and your continued waste of both of our times?
t1_dsfh0hp	0	*	Feelin' paranoid... true enemy or false friend?
t1_dshipxf	0	*	Okay you're right. Iraq did it, but a government 10x worse than Iraq led by a guy that how fed his uncle to dogs wouldn't dare do such a thing. -__-
t1_dsfkjfs	1	*	Yeah, the difference is that now we don't capitalize the madness.
t1_dsfr26x	1	*	Im like 90% sure thats not true
t1_dsfcefw	0	*	What'd you call me?
t1_dsgwpvt	1	*	I assume the US would continue to have bases in Korea (at Korea's request) in order to deter Chinese aggression in the South China Sea 
t1_dsfj0cw	1	*	Not yet
t1_dsfym99	1	*	> Brazil is the home of anal  If true, thanks, guys! 
t1_dsflvog	1	*	Came here to say this and was, as usual, beat to the punch.

t1_dsgykzi	0	*	state ownership of the means of production is capitalist lol someone as intellectually disabled as you would like communism 
t1_dsfrc75	1	*	So if I call you a rapist then you are one to the public? Ya that doesn't make you a bad person or a bad president that makes the accuser a bad person for doing it without proof.

t1_dsfraxt	0	*	Russia and all other asian countries minus 3 will help them out. 
t1_dsfknxg	1	*	Its a MAD world.
t1_duk90vm	0	*	Thanks for all the comments.  I got a better idea of what the nations and different factions are aiming for now.
t1_dt6hl8u	0	*	I guess I just don't see killing defenseless animals with our superior technology, for sport, as much of an accomplishment.

t1_dt37136	0	*	You're right, its not a wartorn African country. It's a war-torn Asian country.
t1_dt303g5	0	*	Quick, someone make a cryptocurrency called Gold-Pressed Latinum
t1_dt3t3fd	1	*	It's difficult to grasp that this is the president of the USA.... I mean.... really!?!
t1_dt312sz	0	*	Are all of these quotes verbatim? Im having a hard time grasping how profoundly retarded Trump is. 
t1_dt31nvq	0	*	Ehhh... Countries are defined by their territory (especially considering that India is a subcontinent), no? So is then North Korea half of Korea or 1/3 of Korea?
t1_dt2tyzh	0	*	If what I am saying is delusional then why can't you disprove what my statements? 
t1_dt33g3q	1	*	Dont forget he's a stable genius
t1_dt3goov	0	*	So you agree? Trump has escalated every military conflict we are currently in. Not to mention the pointless increasing of the military budget to pander to his supporters. 
t1_dt3dt5i	1	*	I know, the adaptation they just made is awesome!
t1_dt34xm0	0	*	Stop putting words in your own mouth.
t1_dt2zku7	0	*	You haven't even the faintest grasp on how journalism works.   Computing principles are a ridiculous thing to try to apply to journalism.
t1_dt3ncj3	1	*	Making claims is fine as long as one intends to learn something rather than just argue
t1_dt33lbx	0	*	> They still believe Obama wasn't born in the U.S.  Im sorry, what? What part of the word still are you having trouble with?
t1_dt2kxlb	0	*	Plus when did he say this, was it a personal conversation the some dink was listening to? Honestly this is the pettiest shit.
t1_dt2ypwt	0	*	>Lmao. Ok. Yea Trump and Lincoln FDR Washington Jefferson, they're all about the same.  FDR **literally** put Japanese Americans in concentration camps.
t1_dt3qcjp	0	*	neither of the protagonists really became overpowered in relation to the other characters in the show, well maybe kurapika, but that's about it.  you enjoyed the manga but dislike the anime? okaay...
t1_dt2y5uq	0	*	Let's call them regressives.
t1_dt36tju	1	*	I think the other person strayed away from the point. I agree, but why would someone even make fun of something like that? That's what the whole thing is about. 
t1_dt43lnz	1	*	You're either too ignorant to spot sarcasm from someone that's on your side or trying way too hard to spin your own narrative
t1_dt31fxu	1	*	Ehhh, all you need to know is continuity reboots have been coming faster and faster, so now a relatively young Batman is gonna gun for Dr. Manhattan, whose fault all this is.
t1_dt3rvdk	1	*	I dont think any one can enlighten you
t1_dt472vs	0	*	Trump's entire presidency is fake satire.

t1_dt34ysb	0	*	> Not a fan of young protagonists that come into power.  > > Loves Code Geass
t1_dt3crd2	0	*	Trump is far from a God to me. But it doesnt take anything more than a seconds thought to realize he did not say what the religion of lies, hatred, and hypocrisy has implied. 
t1_dt34s0k	0	*	I didn't want to know so bad, I was willfully unaware of the Before and the Doomsday. Now I know.  Bring me my Elixir of Un-Know (grabs whiskey, gets shit-faced)

t1_dt34dkb	0	*	Euphie, Kill all Japanese  Holy shit. 
t1_dt2vxa0	0	*	Well I am not an overly fragile snowflake so I guess I wouldn't see  someone who regularly talks with his hands would also use his hands when he mocks someone as mocking the disable.
t1_dt2x9nd	1	*	In other words, there can never again be any whistleblowers. If journalists can't protect sources' identities, then anybody who would fear retaliation for speaking to journalists won't do so. 
t1_dt34y85	0	*	Those are just some articles I could find. I can't go find Facebook and twitter comments on random things lol
t1_dt3uwu6	0	*	A r/t_d subscriber defending Trump? Well color me orange!
t1_dt2zkit	0	*	If newspapers could not use unnamed sources, half of the biggest story would have never been published. That's not how journalism works.
t1_dt3atmf	0	*	Let's get back to the main topic. Do you believe trump supporters have realized trump lied about the 3 million votes?
t1_dt35r3p	0	*	Calling someone out for lying about their ethnicity? He never called Mexicans rapists. Oh so goalposts moved and everything is peachy jfc
t1_dt2ziql	0	*	Get over yourself go outside and smile for once in your life holy shit are you on the edge all the time?
t1_dt38aoi	0	*	Most journalists are lazy.  ~Zannyth circa. 2018  But better yet, they like drama and ratings and are willing to slack on journalistic diligence if they find information to fan the flames.
t1_dt34g04	0	*	> Very rarely.  [Come on buddy.](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/statements/byruling/false/)
t1_dt39a3c	1	*	I get it. I'm just talking about the original story.
t1_dt34tox	0	*	I live in Queens. Trump does not have a Queens, New York accent.
t1_dt398le	0	*	>  Plenty of very smart people believe he is more honest than past presidents.  like?
t1_dt32aw1	0	*	And like having their ear lobes stroked.
t1_dt2vli3	1	*	That's fine for you, but the rest of the world has this thing called investigative reporting. If we all acted like you, no one would know about Watergate.
t1_dt3b9wu	0	*	Still a great satirical adaptation, top mark.
t1_dt31apr	0	*	Not just the best temperament but the best temperawoment and the best temperachildrent too.
t1_dt316lk	0	*	He probably pushes the IQ thingso much as he could just pay someone off or just straight up lie about his actual IQ.
t1_dt3f4jq	0	*	You're a bit..... stupid, huh?
t1_dt39ka0	1	*	Trump could have parked all his inheritance money in a sp500 index and been wayyyyy richer than he is now (and could have played golf guilt free every day of his life)
t1_dt32tq3	0	*	Wow yeah you got me. Good one. 
t1_dt3662x	0	*	Prove it.
t1_dt33gva	0	*	And that's how the Iraq war started. Everyone believed what they were told without evidence because the sources seemed credible.  Who says history doesn't repeat itself?
t1_dt32mnq	0	*	If they're conversations like this, yes it does.   At some point you'll just have to reckon with the fact that Donald Trump is objectively a bad person.  You can't lie to yourself forever. 
t1_dt4af9s	0	*	Are you saying Editors of some British magazine know better than me or the Indian public? Laughable idea, sir. 
t1_dt32yfb	0	*	It might work if they had any credibility left
t1_dt2wx8v	0	*	Because he  speaks with his hands. Is that that big of a logical jump that if one regular speaks with their hands they would also do so  in different situations?
t1_dt30cve	0	*	The cognition test that Trump took was ten extremely basic questions, easily found on the internet, and indicates nothing about his mental ability other than he isnt completely retarded
t1_dt2xkwa	0	*	Wow, youre still replying? 
t1_dt3sm96	1	*	You know as well as I did that I did not answer the question that you are trying to shame me for; another symptom of you not dealing with reality.

t1_du7etz7	0	*	You're justifying the ethnic cleansing of 700k Palestinians by pointing to a massacre of 70 people twenty years earlier. Just let that sink in for a moment. 
t1_dtnwix1	0	*	If you want to a see a real cult of freaks watch mainstream news or go to r/politics. At least t_d has the self awareness to acknowledge their bias.

t1_dtnf3k4	1	*	More people need to understand this
t1_dtnw43q	0	*	Looking at your post history proves you are either a democrat or a leftist. Which completely collapses your argument. 
t1_dsylwko	0	*	It's cool to still see rational people. In fact if you google jungle monkey I believe you find Android games. 
t1_dsyl8hq	0	*	You willfully ignorant piece of shit. You actually are defending a known racist term with false equivalencies. Gtfo.
t1_dsaphos	0	*	Why would that be a suicide route? What if he practiced emergency landings at home for a route he normally flew as a captain?
t1_dv0f0i1	0	*	When I said Ireland, I meant Ireland. I could have also said America, meaning would be the same. Either way you've yet to respond to the principle.

t1_dsx3fgk	0	*	> The memo is written by Nunes  Wait, this is all about a memo written up by *Nunes*?  LOL, what a fucking joke.
t1_dsxo3df	0	*	And? Even if that's the case, what exactly is your point? The Russia-linked accounts are trying to spread that narrative and hashtag.
t1_dsx1nd0	0	*	I could provide links too, the content is what matters. If you fail to defend the content then your links are worthless.

t1_dt4q64u	1	*	Naw, too much fat for my taste.
t1_dt7r5az	0	*	I'm sure they kept doing covert ops because they know they always get caught, oh wait, maybe they dont.  Killing Bin Laden was a sucessfull one that we only know about because they disclosed it.
t1_dt5p42v	1	*	Good point.
t1_dsig7qd	1	*	Yes, it was merely an ill timed coincidence! My bad.  Moron
t1_dsn8rmn	1	*	More like the Swedish government said they don't make such assurances and that at that moment there weren't any extradition processes on him. 
t1_dsh1cgx	0	*	You aren't this stupid, dude. You understand the difference between having implicit biases and being paid or threatened to keep information from the public. 
t1_dsh6xnl	1	*	So would you like me to link you to the court documents?
t1_dsie1mq	0	*	Why didn't we extradite him when he was staying in Sweden before the rape allegations?
t1_dshbw9g	1	*	Except that that is an actual reality that was loved here for years. So it's not hypothetical.
t1_dsh6956	1	*	Just a heads up: You posted this comment twice.

t1_dshkztg	0	*	Nope, there was no extradition order for Ahmed Agiza or Muhammad al-Zery.  That's the whole point of extraordinary rendition; it's extra-judicial.  Edit:  not really sure why this got downvoted.

t1_dtoe07d	0	*	I didn't, and why you even care? 
t1_dtosaoo	1	*	All the more reason to ignore it entirely. The only aspect of reddit karma I enjoy is drawing controversial daggers, as it usually means I'm getting some reaction from both sides of an issue.

t1_du76vmm	1	*	and probably still giving leaks to Hannity
t1_du753eg	0	*	What motive do you suggest? 
t1_du79lqt	0	*	> Eh, but who cares about Obama making a massive push to empty the prison right? Fuck details!  The other 41? 
t1_du6woc4	0	*	If a law is in breach of rights, then the law isn't a valid law. You cannot break a law that wasn't valid to begin with.
t1_du7gcxg	1	*	More than a year. He was in London from November 2010 til June 2012. Was never in jail. Just out on bail after the European Arrest Warrant was issued.
t1_du6uufn	1	*	They did (well, a Swedish prosecutor interviewed him in the Embassy) in late 2016.
t1_du7w0j8	0	*	no, you usually go after everyone and their accomplices, see the current Mueller investigation

t1_du7g656	0	*	>it'd be quite another to do it to someone revered by millions of Americans, to what, illegally detain and torture him in front of the whole world and the American people?  Manning?

t1_dtzihjo	0	*	Ummm it is though, like extremely so, search PubMed if you don't believe me
t1_dtz9zkn	0	*	Or, let gay people marry, Shazam, every has marriage and the only unhappy people are the ones who thought gay people shouldn't marry. I don't see why anyone is trying to appease them.
t1_dtyizvy	1	*	That's democracy for you. 50%+1 vote say how things are runned.
t1_dtyzb4s	1	*	Yep, that's the baby boomers though.
t1_dtyjtdi	1	*	I don't suppose you have a reference? I've tried searching as the idea seems quite far-fetched to me, but with no luck. 
t1_dtxzp9p	1	*	Yeah, most experts agree its really important to make one... At least id you have kids it goes to them, married or not
t1_dty8wmx	1	*	I'm aware. Hence the pet peeve lol.
t1_dtyafr6	0	*	In BC, lawyers recommend a co-habitation agreement in advance, because otherwise you will lose half your shit.
t1_dty21zo	0	*	1 I don't think that argument works there because unlike separated schools there is no diffrence. Also what would happen if they did that for every marriage? 2 not in 13th century France no 
t1_dur95kx	0	*	Kongsberg in da house. Great to hear yourself and others under 30 are aware. Cant say the same with the 45+ plus.
t1_dur76e0	0	*	I know, I'm just kidding with you. Suppose I should have put a /s in the first comment...
t1_dsmdfss	1	*	Smart Tibetans accepted reality and live good lives in China. Stupid Tibetans think independence is possible and get cracked down by police. So in a way,yeah, they asked for it
t1_dsl09us	0	*	Improved infrastructure means improved quality of life. If Tibet was liberated, it would literally become another Afghanistan. 
t1_dskys4m	1	*	That ended with a treaty. No treaty was signed between the PRC and ROC. 
t1_dsltavu	0	*	Having some elite assholes of the same ethnicity governing you does not bring you any more freedom. The fundamental issue is Chinese government vs its citizens, not Han vs Tibetans.
t1_dskzl2f	0	*	The USSR only sent supplies. They never parked an aircraft carrier in between the two sides and threatened to enter the fight. 
t1_dsm2bkg	1	*	Because its Daytime in China and non communist party members are asleep
t1_dslc9kx	1	*	But the discussion isn't about china
t1_dsm5fgm	1	*	Tibetan language is perfectly legal thou. No one is stopping Tibetans from using it and it's printed on the back of every CNY note (along with Mongolian and Chinese).

t1_dslzbmj	1	*	And yet China can't seem to govern without threatening their own citizens into complience. I have no respect for bullies. Respect should be earned, not forced.
t1_dskz8mg	0	*	What if I did believe in giving the Indian reservations their freedom was a good idea? 
t1_dsb8xd9	0	*	And unfortunately many homeless behave in ways that ruin the quality of life for others. Too bad for those people.
t1_ds9w1sv	1	*	> Not all homeless people smoke pot   That's where you're wrong. They are homeless because housing providers require you to refrain from doing drugs.
t1_ds9x5wk	0	*	Not all homelessness, there's still crack addicts and other stuff but they are rarer.
t1_ds9dqx8	0	*	Stalin would provide housing, health care, and help for all.  That's what communism is all about. 
t1_dt0d80y	0	*	No, it doesn't. It's the literal definition of the word.
t1_dtpwau7	0	*	Funny, Greeks and Turks have similar DNA as well
t1_dshs4p0	0	*	Yes I know how supply and demand works. Are you going to add to that, or are you asking me how supply and demand works?
t1_dtc4f9d	0	*	The consensus with the people i'm sat with is that it is more used than I thought, so yes, it's what the British call a megaphone!
t1_dsdeelr	1	*	Do you mean, Israel invaded Jordan in 1967?  Or do you consider Israel as an entire country to be stolen?  
t1_dsdat7y	0	*	Can we also speak about Palestinian human rights abuses or nah?

t1_dsg1qoy	0	*	No, eilat still has access to the gulf of aqaba and the rest of Israel to everything else. There weren't any previous agreements either, there were things Israel said but no agreements. 
t1_dsewquu	0	*	Maybe more expensive oil, yes, but more of all the other forms of trade as well. On the whole it could be beneficial. Especially when oil importance decreases. 
t1_du4k7we	1	*	Thanks MAD! You da real MVP.
t1_dtaeiy4	0	*	Yes and it will keep on happening over and over. Because we are humans. We have different wants and needs.   I recommend read more history so you dont feel so special. ;)
t1_dt4t2j2	0	*	I guess would need to know exactly what words were used, but the statement that if they became involved in something, that they most likely can't pay the bill, isn't discrimitory right?
t1_dss660q	0	*	Not a democrat, not an American. He lost the popular vote, come to grips with it. The majority did not want him.
t1_ds6stfg	1	*	The conversation is petty people who don't like he doesn't take their calls anymore.
t1_dt3r8qe	0	*	Calm down, mr.  logan paul.
t1_dt2t204	1	*	Nobody refers to both continents as America, though.
t1_dszf3dm	1	*	You knew exactly what I meant but you wanted to be sanctimonious.  Whatever. You're not worth any more of my time.
t1_du20iei	1	*	Comes back to doing what I do on my time vs company time.  Criminal record or drug use.  People should be judged by performance not stereotypes.  
t1_du1ute7	0	*	did the app update recently?
t1_dtni324	1	*	We're not talking about the same person.  Feel free to read the information I've linked.  
t1_dtojuvk	0	*	I think it most definitely is. At least insofar as it's a good idea for social construction.  What do you think it means if not that? 
t1_dtoplra	1	*	I bet the cameras come first! National Geographic has a cover article about it.
t1_dtmsuic	1	*	no problem!
t1_dt0z0u9	0	*	Democrats in every election in 2017 outperformed themselves compared to 2016 by close to double digits. 
t1_dt130m7	0	*	When math says something can't happen, it means it is impossible. It is one of the more appealing features of mathematics.
t1_dumqkcw	0	*	The term Indo-European comes from linguistics, the term Yamnaya from archaelogy.  It's looking likely that the two groups were one and the same.
t1_duoc2o4	0	*	I'm not talking about legions literally leaving the country.  Is there no evidence that population levels dropped without the infrastructure of empire?
t1_dung90b	1	*	He was a cool dude
t1_duo9bxx	0	*	Genetics are the ones to determine 200 thousand years etc, maybe I was unlear in my postulation.
t1_dunrs6v	0	*	You've got this propagandists back, huh? Why is that? Why do you help defend RT?
t1_duaeght	0	*	Working as a clerk, I'd say potentially possible.  Entering as a customer, I'd say no.

t1_dtfdxd5	0	*	I took it as a tongue-in-cheek comment when I read it the first time, and you're kind of being a dick.
t1_dtfmfn0	1	*	>  attacking  Can you point out where in my post you think there is an attack? 
t1_dtgirad	0	*	I cant fathom how you could rail OPs mom.
t1_dt69ssb	0	*	People dispose of many more cars than they do homes.  My parents have lived in 1 house for 30 years, but have gone through 9 cars between the two of them in that same time.
t1_dt78bvo	0	*	Oh my, that's still 7,100 miles short of a hong kong to LA trip. My mistake, I was thinking of an actual, currently used electric container ship in China.
t1_duczzha	0	*	Just read the article mate.  He'll have to serve at least 11 years.
t1_dt5mxbz	1	*	Which I guess does technically make it 'one of the biggest' too
t1_dt6bzk5	1	*	To reiterate: how stupid are you?  You're in a thread about the Provisional government.  This all happened after the Tsar was overthrown.
t1_dt5y88y	0	*	No, I am arguing that you are depraved for criticizing the Provisional government at all, when compared to the monsters that replaced it.
t1_dsyjr5j	1	*	Far right wouldn't out of spite. Needless to say, by the President's own criticism it is his fault. It had bi-partisan support and it would have likely passed before he fucked it up.
t1_dsymo54	1	*	You just ignored my arguments to repeat your un-cited claim that this is on the Dems.  So yea... it does seem like you'd be a T_D poster. Although my accusation wasn't a serious one. 
t1_dsyjxsj	0	*	>how does ~~immigration~~ healthcare reform make sense in a ~~budget~~ tax bill? 
t1_du07chh	1	*	All good! 
t1_dut1ldb	0	*	Yeah, they're homeless, they shouldn't be living as well as first world citizens that work full time.
t1_dut0mhx	0	*	Sounds like he refused to stop the meddling to begin with. 
t1_dut7mx9	1	*	It's what Churchill said: Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others.
t1_dutkc0p	0	*	I take extreme issue with his stance on protesting and democratic participation in general.
t1_duudqeu	0	*	Not going into if it's right or wrong, but it sure isn't democratic.
t1_dut5ocf	0	*	That's exactly what I meant with in this day and age. These clowns are indeed living in a fantasy world. Guerilla warfare in US land, against modern military technology, this guy is a joke.
t1_dutie1r	0	*	What's a good neutral source to check up on this?  China owning lots of US debt is something I hear often but I've never personally went and verified.  
t1_dut18dv	0	*	If he will truly be a good dictator he will put great focus on his successors and the method of there choosing into the future.  Maybe reinstating democracy before he goes. (Very hypothetical)
t1_dut1sq3	0	*	https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiananmen_Square_protests_of_1989
t1_dut02s0	0	*	i mean, tax reform was done by the senate and net neutrality by the FCC, neither of them directly involved trump being a lunatic
t1_dusrfln	1	*	well, that's game, set and match.
t1_duu5e02	1	*	Agreed, you have probably been here yourself.
t1_dut3qv0	0	*	Americans aren't magical creatures, every single oppressive government ever had its collaborators and a tyrannical American government is no exception. 
t1_dut320e	1	*	because they are fragile creatures whose feelings need protection. little precious snowflakes.
t1_duu3jm2	0	*	Deng was the real boss at that moment, several memoirs pointed out Yang asked Deng for instruction then finally agreed to do so
t1_duswtac	1	*	Whoops
t1_dut19co	0	*	Except this ignores all academic research on the subject, but I appreciate the stoner cynicism
t1_dut09aj	0	*	Actually, that sounds like terrorist speech. Better scoop him up for one of the three letters to work on, just to be safe.
t1_dut5b7g	0	*	Interesting, thanks for the info!
t1_dut898s	1	*	It's funded by the CIA.
t1_dute7k6	1	*	Most democracies were born the last 200 years may have somethingh to do with it?
t1_dut2mb6	0	*	He lost the popular vote, so not really. If Clinton had been an even remotely exciting candidate Trump would have lost. 
t1_dutrebv	0	*	Mhm thats why majority of your army belongs to the communist party.
t1_dut5xcx	0	*	Oh yeah, dude, you sure showed Soros and the evil liberals. Next you should give your president or PM more power so that you may have a nice dictatorship while you're at it.
t1_duu53x2	0	*	China has never controlled Taiwan. Never has anyone in Taiwan gotten a Chinese passport just for being a Taiwanese citizen. Shit, you can't even get free shipping from taobao if you're in Taiwan.
t1_dut27h1	0	*	It is actually the 22nd Amendment initiated in 1947 and completed in 1951.
t1_dut3v7g	0	*	When people assume that they can't change anything, that is when we lose power and we let dictators take over 
t1_duture8	1	*	Good point, I hadn't thought about that, still I think there can be a good chance the US would intervene, if only to distract the people from an unpopular government
t1_dutuo15	1	*	Swadian here. I don't think I've ever seen a khergit. Mainly because our kingdom is being rekt by a coaliation of Nord, Vaegir and Rhodok at the same time.
t1_dut2pii	0	*	Whether it's the right thing or not, I don't think that imposing additional regulations on speech (even intentional insults) is characteristic of a less authoritarian government.
t1_dut33wa	1	*	  And if they don't they're an android   
t1_dut1qw1	0	*	Let's be honest, Sun Yat-Sen is overrated in history. The only thing he done right is orchestrated the XinHai Revolution. Other than that, he's pretty much a no one.
t1_dut16um	0	*	Nope, it still has yet to be reviewed by the Supreme Court, so its partially in effect until then. It hasnt been ruled legal by a single judge yet.
t1_dusyb8d	0	*	Tigger, please. 
t1_dutcg70	0	*	at least it is just a planned proposal.  I thought it has already passed from the title.  even as a proposal it is a scary thought.

t1_dutl9dh	1	*	You have a two party dictatorship instead!
t1_dut05qq	1	*	No it wasn't a law until FDR served 4 terms. Two terms was the norm and was observed as tradition but there wasn't anything actually stopping people from running for or serving more.
t1_duszax6	0	*	Yes, but only the USA has freedom after speech.

t1_duuyqp6	0	*	But will people still be coming here to look at it? That's the question.

t1_duueuvd	1	*	Thx, but I do need the video itself, which is the problem
t1_dut1aeh	0	*	Yes

t1_dut3xm7	0	*	They are yeah but i believe mine is closer to truth than yours. Funny thing is you will never realize this when you actually live in the US, too much of a bubble. 
t1_dut5ogu	1	*	Which is why only industries remaining in Russia are export of natural resources.

t1_dut3gpf	1	*	Brony logic?
t1_dutibtc	1	*	2017 was the year of the Rooster, and also the year of Trump. I view the rooster as a tribute almost, but Im open to any proof that its meant to be mocking him 
t1_dut4sjy	1	*	Plus people around the world are more likely to be invaded by US than by China.

t1_dvn6h0b	0	*	Yep pretty funny, glad youre aware of some humorous situations since many Democrats these days are so incognizant of what was obviously a joke.
t1_duteox5	1	*	Progress is not instantaneous. A single event does not override the general theme. Stepping forward still leaves one foot behind. This is more akin to taking an actual step back. 
t1_duthfq7	0	*	How is the Khergit Khanate? Since you are a very rare faction on Calradia. 
t1_dut8r2o	1	*	Same with salazar 
t1_duuar8w	0	*	They conquered Tibet because they can. Same reason white people conquered America and expelled native Americans: because they can.
t1_dut2li5	0	*	No, but an increase in aggression on all fronts does not pan out when we haven't expanded where we use drones.
t1_duud7ui	1	*	China never has liberal democracy though. The civial war was between facists KMT and communists CCP. If CCP didn't win, China would remain under KMT's facist rule until the end of Cold War.

t1_dskgxss	1	*	Yeah, they've all got guns after all, right?  [/Joke] [/Mostly] 
t1_dsk648y	1	*	Trump being a Nazi, alright. Personally I don't believe that he is a Nazi just a very conservative leaning person, but to each his own.
t1_dsk75ef	0	*	In different ways, yes, but ultimately everyone is susceptible to biases and flaws.
t1_dsl5k3x	1	*	Love Stewart Lee.

t1_dsl7opv	0	*	If it was someone I literally despised I probably wouldn't listen to them no matter what language they used so why would it even matter.
t1_dsk7bqm	0	*	No, not really...shitty false equivalencies like that are equally to blame.

t1_dsk9y5d	0	*	A rich, racist asshole whose entire life is based around getting back at the people who slighted him? Yeah... sounds pretty close to me.
t1_dskato9	0	*	It must be hard to run a campaign out of a cell. 
t1_dskpdqg	1	*	Yeah all those there are 500 genders! all men are sexist pigs! the patriarchy wahhhh! people are right geniuses.
t1_dsk4b2y	0	*	Oh, because Nazis are delicate snowflakes and we can't call them out because otherwise they'll just hate us more.
t1_dsk9xkc	0	*	We have literally never lost to the communists - we also won WW1 and WW2 single handedly. Suck it Europe.   ... /S
t1_dskq3dm	0	*	Your reading comprehension could use some work.
t1_dskct2y	1	*	Yeah, that's pretty normal for London. Rent around there is in the xa32000 region.
t1_dskm3ut	1	*	I believe Leela is hugging Fry and she says, what stinks? Have you been rolling around in New Jersey? 
t1_dska18y	0	*	My bad I assumed you were an American and we all know what happens when you assume. Seem as you are Canadian can we still do a swap? 
t1_dskfb5a	1	*	It's probably more due to the fact that his policies are actively damaging to trade, climate, national security, etc. But yes, the racism and sexism certainly doesn't help. 
t1_dsl38qo	1	*	Well, the first step to google is to know what to look up, and to want to know the information.  Trump doesn't want to actually know anything.
t1_dsk919x	1	*	That's... uhhh... my pet bird. 
t1_dsk5xgr	1	*	He learned from the best.
t1_dsknzho	0	*	How is he Hitler tho? 
t1_dskbe9t	1	*	Too bad there wasn't a cameraman in position to get a close up of his face. Would have been priceless.
t1_dskolpd	0	*	Best country in the world? We have Nazis parading about in the street and you're claiming that this is the best country in the world?
t1_dskgdjr	0	*	We are calling it like we're seeing it.  He's a dickhead.  Got a problem with that? GTFO.
t1_dskk2tq	1	*	Yea I guess not. 
t1_dskp0nw	1	*	It's not too rare for someone very focused into one field of study to be really dumb in other areas.  That's the beauty of humanity, everyone can be stupid. 
t1_dskbooc	0	*	In England? Some.
t1_dskbnkn	1	*	Hanlon's razor still applies. Trump's reasoning is as follows:  - embassy deal was made before Trump's presidency - before Trump, Obama was president - therefore: embassy deal was made by Obama
t1_dskdn1m	1	*	> Northern Ireland hasn't had a government for over a year  Can't say I've noticed a difference
t1_dslc8e1	1	*	True, but I thought his leg was in America still
t1_dski50g	1	*	asktrumpsupporters is just a KKK meeting where they all dress in nice clothes and pretend not to be KKK members.
t1_dsk65qx	1	*	Your precious fatso is failing hard at being president, it must feel extremely embarrassing to slowly realize this. Nice try grasping at straws though.
t1_dskr14k	1	*	Well sure, but a third party vote is also a waste of a vote given the FPTP electoral structure 
t1_dsla0ub	0	*	Yes, and I can tell you you are still wrong.  
t1_dsxs3j3	0	*	Did you move to Australia because of the election or did you escape before the turd took office?
t1_dskkpg4	0	*	Except under your thinking, people from Saudi Arabia would be banned as they have funded terrorism. Oh wait, Trump has business links with the Saudis? Of course they're exempt, no terrorism there!
t1_dsk5h2x	1	*	Ohhh, so you're a troll. 
t1_dskbmsv	1	*	Exactly my point, but it leaves a real bad taste in your mouth, is somewhat humiliating, and so the generally poorly educated will usually pick the muddied water.
t1_dskf9yb	1	*	He's objectively a disgusting idiot  Fixed that for you
t1_dska6x1	0	*	A billionaire born into wealth.
t1_dskk5nz	0	*	Excuses. As a president (or a figure of prominence with a national podium) his words carry weight and meaning. One dumbass comment can misrepresent and miseducate millions.
t1_dskfd03	0	*	Did you forget the /s, or is this actually not sarcasm?  It is hard for me to believe that someone actually believes 'not being PC' is the reason people do not like Trump.

t1_dskdsk4	0	*	Funny enough it's actually Richard - Rickard - Dickard - Deckard Cain - Sean Connery.
t1_dsklqty	1	*	Because the interviewers were London people they'd have thought you were stark raving mad driving that far. Especially through the snow. Trains can't even go through that stuff!

t1_dsk5zjq	1	*	At the point when it's a man fucking a boy. Even if that man is 19 and the boy is 18. Roy Moore seriously, with a straight face, ran on a platform of wanting to, among other things, outlaw gay sex.
t1_dskpjgk	1	*	The face was blank but I knew exactly what face it was pulling. 
t1_dskbdok	1	*	Dickard.....(sniggers)
t1_dske9r7	1	*	You inferred he was actually popular. Then you do a complete 180 with that bit about how they're not vocal because he's unpopular.
t1_dskcno9	0	*	>The only way he survives to have a second term is if literally no one paid attention--or if the other candidate is SOMEHOW worse.  DNC: Hold my beer

t1_dskvvlr	1	*	I wasn't actually trying to be callous, FYI  I was sarcastically referring to Trump and the GOP's nature of saying and doing things to spite what they percieve as snowflakes.
t1_dskczsy	0	*	I always think of that Tory MP who billed the taxpayer for cleaning his moat.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Hogg
t1_dskahvo	1	*	Oh I definitely don't think it's the only major reason he ran. But the election was so close I bet he'd have lost in a timeline where Obama didn't roast him.

t1_dsk52rq	0	*	That is a completely understandable and justified viewpoint. And frankly one I have nothing to counter with, 'twas a pleasure.
t1_dskacp9	1	*	Too bad it couldn't be *great* again. 
t1_dskh1eb	1	*	Well we couldnt blame bush for things the Pre 2008 Obama backed deep state did /s

t1_dskgtym	1	*	We should not have voted for someone with such low standards is what I'm saying.  America should hold the POTUS to a higher standard.
t1_dskcsjk	1	*	I agree.
t1_dskd08i	1	*	It's much higher, but nothing on the US.
t1_dsk5xbw	0	*	> He made assurances then failed to live up to them.  I'm baffled that anyone doing business with Trump doesn't just *expect* this to happen.

t1_ds3rfu8	1	*	No, not at all.
t1_ds3p9s6	0	*	No offense but literally not what I asked for. Not saying I dont believe you or those arent valid points. But I asked for studies which come to those conclusions. 
t1_ds3mev4	1	*	Way to miss the joke
t1_ds4xxqj	1	*	Yea but obviously not enough people believe its a big issue that needs immediate attention. Its like understanding that you have stage 2 cancer but wanting to wait until its stage 4 to do something.
t1_ds3pnls	0	*	Why are you going down a comment volley with this one guy and ignoring those that linked you the evidence you asked for? 
t1_ds40i9j	0	*	Climate change /= global warming. Global warming was a theory that was proven wrong multiple times and did not cause the doomsday scenario that the left was screaming about for years.

t1_ds3s6fr	1	*	Lol okay whatever dude call me out, im so ashamed of myself... Nobody on reddit knows me so please continue to be a petty cry baby.

t1_ds3zxpy	1	*	You're completely excluding the entire context to what makes it man-made climate change. Sorry, it's not ignorant, it's disingenuous.
t1_ds572lr	0	*	you are ignoring that the box (your lungs) only hold a FIXED number of atoms.   you can't go to 90 blue 20 red.   it changes to 80 blue 20 red.   
t1_ds51t3e	1	*	Yep! Accepted quite a while ago. :) 
t1_ds48ixl	1	*	I usually refer to the process as 'climatic instability' when I'm explaining it. I think it does a good job of explaining without over simplifying.

t1_dtc1nu5	1	*	:) Youre welcome!
t1_dtc5y5f	0	*	Agreed, it's one of the reasons that books life 1984 scare me. I don't fear that I would die horribly in such a world, I fear that I would thrive. 
t1_dtc9cbt	0	*	Classic reddit, arguing with imaginary people with imaginary opinions. 
t1_dtbx27z	0	*	You seem to be applying things you read about the entire regime to every single person, some random guy from Munich in 1940 isn't literally Hitler.
t1_dtbyax7	0	*	Oh right I meant that I disagreed with the story being awesome, so I guess I agree.
t1_dtby0n3	0	*	Well, not every German was a Nazi.

t1_dtc9a5z	0	*	Good point. Yeah, Ive heard the surge was like the Wild West. I didnt make it over there til 2011 and it was much stricter then. 
t1_dtbswln	1	*	We also don't want to destabilize one of the relatively stable states in the Middle East. No one particularily wants to see what would come out of SA if they collapsed. 
t1_dtbwjwv	1	*	He's really not. In an attempt to dismantle the capitalist system he slaughtered a lot of innocents
t1_dtbwdq7	1	*	Then youre even less qualified to say anything about someones appreciation for their country youve never been to. Maybe dont judge something you have no experience with.
t1_dtc2cff	1	*	But then the US added fuel to the fire in Afghanistan and CIA organized a coup in Iran to remove the democratic leader. Of our way Russia is also involved but in Iran, US was the big player.

t1_dtc70z0	0	*	You had Russian bots on your side. Doesn't mean everyone is a bot. I'm in disbelief that I have to explain this concept
t1_dtbyv9t	0	*	Yeah, people use religion to kill others, you're exactly right. How? Through their *interpretation*. It's not the religion itself, just like it's not the gun itself.
t1_dtc5mbw	0	*	That's where you're mistaken- Insurgents and terrorists aren't the same, but freedom fighters aren't exempt from using methods of terror as they have multiple times through history.
t1_dtc00nx	1	*	Definitely hundreds of millions if not a billion. They were a British colony and I imagine its the most common language taught in school.
t1_dtc99h5	1	*	No, instead we slaughter innocents by the thousands and harrass the rest on a daily basis. We commit terror on a much larger scale than they do.

t1_dtm5x9c	0	*	Well if having experience and stating facts are classic right wing drivel I think I need to rethink my political ideology.
t1_dtm3yz2	0	*	> Nothing is stopping you.  Other than money and language/cultural barrier. I've looked at what I could do for Rojava and currently it is zilch. Stop assuming shit it makes you look like an idiot.
t1_dtmxou2	1	*	I'm comparing Fidel and saying you can't be mad at people for being happy that the legacy of a murderer is going away.  But I can't expect a 21st century communist to be smart, right?
t1_dtmdn8t	1	*	It's a place name
t1_dtm33kp	1	*	Seriously you'd think with the entirety of the internet at your fingertips you could both looking up basic definitions, and also maybe some logically fallacies while you are at it.  
t1_dtm2si3	0	*	To be fair, so does capitalism. I think people just look for reasons to be horrible.
t1_dtmpnlp	1	*	Fuck off.
t1_dtmh0cm	0	*	He was an illegitimate child. He never had any right to the throne. He was the true Jon Sno of the North. 
t1_dtm10ga	1	*	You ever read an actual book about communist economics? You know there are communist economics professors? 70 years old and such.
t1_dtmjx8c	0	*	So how do you feel about brutal capitalist dictatorships, does that compel you to speak out against capitalism too? 
t1_dtmpmr2	1	*	Communists do not want lol free stuff
t1_dtm9ijs	0	*	People in concentration camps survived with that amount of food, means they weren't starved by your logic.
t1_dtz1cun	0	*	You're a toxic individual. Get some sleep. Maybe have a snickers.
t1_dtz1zxy	0	*	If by European, you mean anyone who isn't American, because WhatsApp is ubiquitous pretty much everywhere except the US.
t1_dtz22hb	1	*	I'm 30 this year, and honestly it's 50/50. I feel I'm right around that divide where people are actively disconnecting from it.
t1_dtz65hr	0	*	Yeah?  Just don't be a stupid science bitch
t1_dtz190h	0	*	It wasn't a joke. Occam's razor. 
t1_dtzb32l	1	*	It's biased because the users a predominately from on political spectrum. You don't get banned for a dissenting opinion though.
t1_dtyz22f	0	*	So... People leaving Facebook for insta doesnt really affect them......
t1_du0p6hn	1	*	I have a reasonable outlook on the world if that's what you mean.
t1_dtzmfy2	0	*	Still not a joke.
t1_dtz2a7n	0	*	I really think a lot of the people who say they didn't/don't recognize it as a joke aren't being honest with themselves, lol
t1_dtzvbnn	1	*	Yeah, I don't really get that one. Hate speech has been forbidden in Germany for a while now for obvious reason. It creates hatred and is the epitome of stupidity. 
t1_dtyzzyo	0	*	Removing chronological posts:      Do you want your website to jump the shark? Because that's how you get your website to jump the shark.
t1_du00d64	0	*	you don't know how to have a discussion. it's boring speaking to the easily outraged.

t1_dtz486g	1	*	She can also technically declare war without consulting parliament. Obviously shes never exercised that right, but she retains it.
t1_dtz1074	0	*	Yeah sure, that's what I said. What kind of grade 5 debating class is this in here tonight?
t1_dtz2zxd	1	*	Okay but if *any* speech needs protection i think we can all agree that it's far-right disinformation.
t1_dtzmb0r	0	*	For timbits (donut holes) not actual donuts those are sold in dozens
t1_dtz19p2	1	*	Because we've had to fucking put up with it for 2 years
t1_dtz5tn4	0	*	I can understand bots, but how can they tell if two user accounts are run by the same person? I don't think that's possible really.
t1_dtz11f3	0	*	Courts are part of the government.
t1_dtz3g0f	0	*	I do love my country & I do hate Islamists. 
t1_dtza9r9	1	*	Yes they do

t1_dtz33po	0	*	Where else would you go if you bailed?
t1_dtyz10a	1	*	Freedom of conscience does nothing to justify your ideas. If you make a derogatory comment, you don't get to say wrong think as if your ability to say it somehow justifies it.
t1_dtzahuo	1	*	Hahahaha oh god.  You seriously think Facebook would exclude bots and fake accounts from their active users number?  I bet you think Twitter does the same thing.
t1_dtzs8jx	0	*	it's called the burden of proof? same reason I can't tell you that I have a unicorn and expect you to disprove it
t1_dtz254m	0	*	American asking Canadiens if they got rid of the jelly filled timbits in Canada as well or if that is just in the states...also the frosted jelly donut, they glaze them all here now.

t1_dtz1czi	1	*	> unless you're European, ain't no one using WhatsApp  what do you mean?  why is that?
t1_dtyyzr0	0	*	Once again, I have seen the entire footage. I don't think it comes across as a joke.  Please stop assigning malice to me simply because we disagree on an issue.
t1_dtzfhxw	1	*	Even pron sites!!

t1_dtzakt8	0	*	Well then ur not tagged but the pic with you on it is still online; for everyone visible and saved to the database. Great Scott; thank god i can approve my tags!
t1_du0z9i3	0	*	ok fine. my reddit experience is different than yours. Sorry yours is so negative. I'm not trying to be subborn or close-minde whatsoeve.
t1_dtz0j3y	1	*	Its asinine.   My guess is theyd not expected video to be as big as it is but also they want us to keep scrolling 
t1_dtzdxln	0	*	its not that at all. its been a left incline for a long while. eventually it just turned into a cesspool
t1_dtz04zu	0	*	Those things are mostly looking out for non contributing members of society
t1_dtyuqt2	0	*	Well dont tell me man, I agree with you 
t1_dtzdd4z	0	*	Except Muslim Americans, Mexican Americans, Black Americans, Liberal Americans, Socialist Americans. I could love America too if I cut out 99% of the population. Great job. 
t1_dtzdblu	0	*	Being an explicit hivemind is worse than accidental hivemind. The former means they willingly adhere to delusional thinking. 
t1_dtzuy0i	1	*	Yeah sorry im at work. Might read that later. 
t1_du08gph	0	*	Facebook is not a right, it is a platform.  Just like the NYT is not a right, it is a platform.  The ability to use that platform to communicate is a fundamental human right.  
t1_dtyykid	1	*	Wha? I try to limit it to the dangerous..
t1_dtz0rcx	0	*	IMHO, online social websites are like hangouts in the real world. Every generation is going to have their own that are considered cool. Nothing Facebook can do about it.
t1_dtz0irr	0	*	I have no idea what you're saying in that sentence
t1_dtyy2r3	1	*	Interesting conclusion you drew there, considering Bob Menendez is white.
t1_dtz2phr	1	*	Maybe not in your social circle grandpa, but Whatsapp is fairly popular in USA among younger people. 
t1_dtz95gs	1	*	I know, I feel terrible
t1_dtznh2v	0	*	I'm confused. Who's Sophie?
t1_du0b4nl	1	*	Almost as though a clear consensus exists among Reddit's userbase?
t1_dtznnf3	0	*	I'm just saying if something were to over take fb it wouldn't be Google plus it'd be something new. Like snap or new snap.
t1_dtzahj6	0	*	Perfect. Maybe I'm delusional or naive but I feel  the left was actually progressive at some point but post-Trump they seem have copied the rights playbook and are on a dangerous path.    
t1_du0d8p6	0	*	And this somehow proves that the election was stolen? Explain yourself.
t1_dtz0klu	1	*	Lol. They scare me tbh
t1_dtz5a5b	0	*	Trump is, undoubtedly, a piece of shit though
t1_dtzh087	0	*	This is the type of leftist cancer that needs to die.  He's done plenty of good things but if you can't see that then you're in for a long 7 more years. 
t1_dtzo2ai	1	*	Again. That might work for your profession. It certainly doesn't for mine.  It's not THE main draw. It's the man draw for you.  
t1_dtzawdb	0	*	im british man, i dont give a fuck, I just love how regurgitated what you're saying is
t1_dtzmn2u	0	*	Nobody says xir and xem either, but Trudeau made it law.
t1_dtzaaat	1	*	To be happy a man needs a woman who can entertain him, a woman who can satisfy him, and a woman who can challenge him. It is vital that these women never meet.
t1_dtz8tww	0	*	Right, so act like them and then the world is a better place. Got it.
t1_dtz3ym2	1	*	Hey man I read it on Facebook so I'm sure it's legit.

t1_dtyz0hq	1	*	But why wouldn't paid mods do a better job? 
t1_dtzb1su	0	*	Trump isn't being investigated for anything. Guess you spent too much time on r/politics
t1_dtz4wwy	0	*	Thats because it wasnt funny. Generally jokes tend to be fun.
t1_dtzncyj	0	*	Hey look over here everyone! It's an extremist!
t1_dtzap8c	1	*	You don't need fb to join tinder anymore.
t1_dtz6ku2	0	*	The trouble with new apps is getting everyone to start using it, especially when 90% of them have a Facebook account that does that job just fine.
t1_dtz1ewj	0	*	Like many other criticisms of Trudeau, the budget comment was taken out of context. But why lets facts get in the way? It's been working pretty well for the conservatives so far
t1_dtyvgyn	0	*	Can you bring anything to the discussion or just attack his character?  
t1_dtz1efo	1	*	He projects.
t1_dtza94n	1	*	Yes

t1_dtz178m	1	*	Trudeau is already King Kong PC.

t1_duqgcji	0	*	Hoovers suck.
t1_duqnnsl	1	*	Would that we weren't more likely every day to see it tested.

t1_duqnkwt	1	*	J Edgar'ed?
t1_duwfths	1	*	This is your diplomat to the world.  And the U.S. is absolutely dependent on global stability and economic agreements for its success.
t1_duqlaro	1	*	We can still detect his anger in the infrared.
t1_duqvqxm	0	*	I just wanted to say I appreciate you incorporating your /s into your actual comment. Think I'll hold on to that idea.

t1_durf61f	1	*	Nah it's all good man
t1_duqudy8	1	*	Your first sentence is a deflection. Followed by more deflection. For the do called patriotic party, you sure are ok with Russia fucking with our shit 
t1_duqnq92	0	*	Why does no one see the Bush-CIA connection.  The CIA is like the mafia.  You never actually retire.  How do we think Bush just gave up his CIA contacts once he went into politics?
t1_duqlkyz	1	*	Your cakes don't taste boss.  Let's PVP this shit out!
t1_dur17i5	1	*	It doesn't matter until it says Donald Trump, and the point is it hasn't and likely won't. 
t1_duqkh5x	1	*	Not crookery, but I like how the second Lou Dobbs said some explicitly racist shit about mexicans he got an offer from Fox News.
t1_duqu42l	0	*	Would any state charge him? Or is this strictly federal?
t1_duqozut	1	*	Lol, not to my knowledge.   Around 72 OJ came to my dad's high school for some event and my dad was a huge USC fan so he had OJ sign some USC stuff.   
t1_duqlmrm	0	*	When? 
t1_dura51q	0	*	His word salad makes my head hurt.

t1_duqrqhj	1	*	Almost as bad as doubleplus rapemurder!
t1_duqow1s	0	*	You realise they have stopped saying #collusion even on MSDNC and CNN.   It's all they said for over a year and now they have had to give it up. Theres no there there :)
t1_duqlqj4	0	*	How will his healthiest President ever doctor explain it?
t1_dur1hzd	0	*	Are you suggesting that if Hillary committed a crime and somehow was let off the hook then the Trump gang should also get a pass?
t1_duqu82l	1	*	The President can pardon people who have not yet been convicted, but there's no case law supporting the idea of crimes not yet committed.
t1_duqs9s8	0	*	This only works if you inherit a good sum of money.
t1_duqkoa7	1	*	He was pardoned.

t1_duqxxwz	1	*	Kevin McAllister stayed in the Herbert Hoover Suite in Home Alone 2, believing it to have been named after the vacuum guy. This was moments after he encountered Donald Trump in the lobby.
t1_duqnv8a	1	*	....so we should go get Scotty and LaForge?
t1_dur1eb3	0	*	Look at this guy still repeating that Uranium One bullshit. [How about you watch fox news debunking it.](https://youtu.be/8vCjyWlpmEY)
t1_duqshsh	0	*	There difference between you and me is that you believe the rose-colored glasses will come off. These folks have crazy-glued them on, willingly.
t1_duqqr8h	1	*	No need to bring J Edgar into this, man.
t1_duqs5eq	0	*	Gordon Liddy has his own syndicated radio show for a while. Before I got wise, I'd listen to him with my dad. I remember enjoying his wit. I was also 15 years old, and was stupid.

t1_duqo3qs	1	*	Shia Labeouf is an idiot.
t1_duqm6yt	1	*	Thats exactly what he means.
t1_duqrltd	0	*	It's hard to know what a peaceful colonization would have looked like when 90% of the native population died due to disease.
t1_durkzrv	1	*	Did you lie on purpose about it being refuted or were you just genuinely misinformed?
t1_duqp97e	1	*	Then we'll have to resort to the [only man](https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/gameofthronesimpregnable1.jpg) able to get around that shit
t1_duqz5kq	0	*	First guy to sign on endorsing Trump was Chris Christie. Bird, meet feather.

t1_dsomz0l	1	*	Booking population and I believe the Palestinians are fatter now then they've ever been in history. Worst genocide ever.
t1_dsrtx0a	0	*	Yup, he had a conscience. Making him an outlier among Israelis who happily followed orders of the IDF to expel civilians from their lands.  
t1_dsopeja	0	*	You can serve in the military and post service not be willing to die for your country or support your countries policies. This is about philosophy not law

t1_dsyqqrj	0	*	Hi Ajit 
t1_dtxhd2f	1	*	Laws can be clearly corrupt and punitive, they are created by humans, not handed down by some divine being.
t1_dtxgicx	0	*	Perhaps the law itself is overly punitive and reeks of corruption?
t1_dtxgjrk	1	*	Thanks for the clarification!

t1_du2e0fv	0	*	Punyala kadhi yenar?
t1_dtxprwd	1	*	It seems like it's kind of a manufactured paradise. Luxurious hotels, restaurants, shopping. Yes, nice to visit. But underneath that, you wouldn't really want to stay. Very strange place.
t1_dsx8ze4	0	*	Just so we don't get confused, which ones are you referring to? You mean post-colonial era?
t1_dtqdhkr	1	*	Are you deliberately trying to miss the point? karai2 is *calling out* racism.

t1_duuthfv	0	*	Their parents or grandparents were and would have directly affected their lives. Group Areas Act of 1953 was arguably more impactful and very much a memory.

t1_dtsk6x0	0	*	... Why would Chinese people have chips?
t1_dtomfr0	1	*	The Confederates didn't kill millions of black people in a concentrated effort. Didn't start the bloodiest war in human history either.

t1_dtogxd1	0	*	>So now it's a contest to see who killed more   I don't know! I'm not the one who started this chain. If it was up to me we wouldn't be having a fucking contest. It's fucking inane.
t1_dtoq2rd	0	*	Yea because 1st world citizens never do anything atrocious. 
t1_dtokt39	0	*	Pretty much. It used to be standard at the end of all mathematical proofs until they started replacing it with a solid square. It's a shame tbh because it doesn't have that same mic-drop feel.
t1_dtorzqc	0	*	I dont think so. They said most educated young people were trying to get out to avoid the terrible economy.   This was pre-Brexit though, so they may have to go somewhere else.

t1_dtoi9sh	0	*	I mean, that was pretty brutal. But I was going more along the lines of the Bolshevik revolution and the Red Terror. The rise of Fascism was a direct response to that.
t1_dtohxlf	0	*	But you don't explain anything.  You are speculating on assumptions, while the fact is that he made the active decision to chop up a body instead of calling authorities.  
t1_dtohdw3	0	*	But it wasn't about slavery, it was about states rights! says the person that doesn't realise it was about the right to keep slaves.
t1_dtoghzv	0	*	I mean, you kinda described Reconstruction in the south. 
t1_dtohdea	0	*	I never said it had nothing to do with slavery, but saying that's the only reason is absurdly ignorant

t1_dtortlm	0	*	Moin is all you need

t1_dtojmrx	0	*	Saying mean things to me is making me a racist and a Nazi. Also, calling that out is also making me those things too  Yes, it's all our fault.

t1_dtohicr	1	*	Yeah, true.
t1_dtouq7m	0	*	No, just hate idiots like you. 
t1_dtophs6	1	*	Nah, not really.  The first time you _really_ fall for somebody, you're likely to be telling yourself: They're the one. I'll never be able to get anyone else. I need them.
t1_dtpqd79	1	*	No I didnt know that.  I thought the Caribbean was a European continent in Italy. 
t1_dtok2nq	1	*	Condescending. look it up
t1_dtoge24	1	*	When I was visiting Japan with some white friends there's places where they couldn't go and I'd laugh because I've never had black priveledge before.
t1_dtofb85	0	*	Nobody is saying you shouldn't be able to display it. We're just saying that it's something assholes do.
t1_dtokbi9	1	*	But not the right to outlaw slavery.
t1_dtop7jy	0	*	> Socialism still lives in South America, Asia, Africa, and has roots in Europe. And it grows only stronger.  Well alrighty then  I can say the same for fascism in those areas
t1_dtofx4u	1	*	Because they only pay the cheapest price
t1_dtp1w1q	0	*	>tricking
t1_dtoezt4	0	*	All of this does not change the fact that Battle Flag of the Army of Northern Virginia today is a symbol of slavery and racial hatred against black people.
t1_dtp326v	0	*	Not my fault people tend to look a certain way when they are from a certain part of the world.
t1_dtopypq	1	*	Why do you think he was on the right in the first place

t1_dton7w3	0	*	Sure, jimbo. Blame your lack of understanding of the nuances of English on me. 
t1_dtomtnv	0	*	I don't know why he did it.  Regardless of why he did it, it's no excuse.
t1_dtoju8g	0	*	How so. Mussolini was one of historys great socialists. And you know Hitler was a socialist right? How am I confused here?

t1_dtopkoc	0	*	You have a problem with that?
t1_dtot4xa	1	*	So.. the French flag?
t1_dtorjlu	1	*	Well yeah, obviously everything I say is anecdotal. Actual statistics for this are just colections of large numbers of anecdotal experiences. 
t1_dtonbj4	0	*	Ditto for the US
t1_dtotl1d	0	*	It's not something that happens often, so why is it so strange he's suprised?

t1_dtp03vy	0	*	So what you're saying, PECOSbravo aka Cathy: is you hate women and are totally fine with them being raped and murdered and having a few raped and murdered is totally a cost you're willing to pay
t1_dtosltw	0	*	Right?  Leoben doesn't really seem like the place for it.  Owners were normal.  They have a dog in the store, which is dope.

t1_dtomkd4	1	*	 Good luck dude. Wish you guys all the best. 
t1_dtozl5a	0	*	Then why ignore my point?
t1_dtp6qkx	1	*	Speech is free. *Believing* some speech sometimes takes quite some investment.
t1_dtom0mu	1	*	He only posts on the Donald and conspiracy so the claim hes banned from all political subs is bullshit as he only posts on two that he's an active member of 
t1_dtosa7q	1	*	I don't know, most people throughout history have been cunts... 
t1_dtolaq2	1	*	It also did not exist until 1864, basically the end of the war, and certainly after total war became the Union MO.  My point stands.

t1_dtollab	0	*	Or by foreign intervention 
t1_dtpicis	1	*	Salzburg. Doesn't come much more Catholic than that.  I have some friends in Graz now, and now that I've spent some time there too it doesn't seem quite so bad. 
t1_dtpcskz	1	*	That's my point.  YOU don't see it.  The fact that you think black and white students mingling at school means there's no racism in your community is really, painfully naive. 
t1_dtp457e	1	*	Yes, that's what I mean. And yeah - I've searched for a term to describe it, but 'confrontational' is probably the right one 
t1_dtpv2zv	0	*	Yeah, he said he is a sphincter...
t1_dtomgjf	0	*	You were accusing me to be an alt-righter for pointing out that Sweden is getting more and more unwelcoming because of the masses of misbehaving immigrants.
t1_dtonzvr	0	*	Paolo Di Canio did a fascist salute come to my mind. 
t1_dton6r0	1	*	Come for the comments on facism, stay for the apropos language usage.
t1_dtoknpb	0	*	Oh for sure. I'm just responding to /u/Scumbag_ 's question of who else did we not expect. War makes monsters of us all.
t1_dtolipc	0	*	You can't lose fleet engagements if your ships don't go to sea because they don't have fuel. 
t1_dtojrrh	0	*	Do you mean Reconstruction?
t1_dtoiogi	1	*	Kinda like feels before reals....   Perhaps no one should be a Dick, or just realise life is funny and no one gets out alive?
t1_dtokl5w	0	*	I dont buy that line of reasoning. Im very pro my own family but I dont see outsiders as villainous or particularly dangerous. Liking one group doesnt mean disliking another.
t1_dtop1sb	0	*	That's the same justification all racists use. 
t1_dtowx84	1	*	Bulgaria.
t1_dtol9b1	0	*	No, prisoners were stuck in camps where the conditions were squalid and you ran a good risk of dying from disease or malnutrition. Look up Andersonville in GA or the Chicago pow camp.
t1_dtp18ed	0	*	No worries lol. Have a good one!
t1_dtomgk7	1	*	I think you are definitely correct in saying that British Skinhead movement helped popularize and unify Neo-Nazis globally.
t1_dtosub6	0	*	Lol....wow and this is why your previous comment remains laughable, you dumb shit...
t1_dtonel5	0	*	> standing looking perplexed  So you couldn't even follow along with the description?  No, but your comment reflects poorly on your character and intelligence. In all realty. 
t1_dtom2t1	1	*	Franco leaves a very sour taste in the Spanish public. You're speaking as if Francophiles and neonazis are endemic and significant in their respective countries when it's far from it.
t1_due0j4n	0	*	You literally said Most of the alt right is hidden behind a computer, and are too much of cowards to actually go kill people (especially based on specifically their race). You're wrong. 
t1_dtopcc6	0	*	Yeah I know about all that. The USSR was awful, but Stalin especially so. I hate that there are still Stalinists, he was no better than Hitler. 
t1_dtoxyjb	1	*	Trading enlisted men only occurred very early in the war, the Union realized it was way more cost effective for them to not parole because of their huge disparity in numbers.
t1_dtojsax	1	*	I mean...you didn't lie. 
t1_dton8ge	1	*	Reconciliation didn't occur, though.   At no point did the United States ever have or restore friendly relations with the Confederacy, it was defeated and dismantled instead. 
t1_dtoqugi	0	*	I don't.  I do have an issue with Nazis though.  Go take your bullshit back to Stormfront
t1_dtogfdh	1	*	You're welcome, I hope you have a good day.
t1_dtokskp	0	*	No. Because they thought their punishment met the crime
t1_dtp4ebp	1	*	UM, ok.   You do you, pal
t1_dtos5os	1	*	Well it certainly has those connotations to enough people to make it a national issue.
t1_dub3w4x	1	*	Dunno, looks okay now, but we both obviously mistook something. Whoops! Still keeping the bulk of my comment because I think the sentiment belongs here.
t1_ducc622	0	*	Why are they also pretending to be something they are obviously not?
t1_du6lc7n	1	*	It isn't about religion, I can't judge on what religion you follow, i can only share what ive studied and found with what you posted

t1_dt42zdg	1	*	Once again, thank you! I appreciate it.
t1_dtdbwya	0	*	Guess what they never implemented socialism. 
t1_dt2hnmk	0	*	So what if it's based on a Russian article? Why would a western media house parrot them unless it's true? Don't hide behind lame Russiophobia. Learn to fucking think
t1_dt2h609	0	*	In the land of whataboutism you always try to deflect stuff away from the topic.

t1_dsddcdq	0	*	You're conflating raids into hospitals to arrest injured terrorist suspects with dropping bombs on hospitals being used by militants for non-hospital purposes.  Nice job mangling the truth.
t1_dsdca4m	0	*	Throwing anti-Israel talking points at me isn't going to change the facts. You think Palestine's war crimes are justified. I don't. Let's agree to disagree, okay?
t1_dsjsdm4	0	*	My concern is for the country.  This isnt a competition.  Its not about winning and losing.  Its about saving the nation from the fallout from that dotard thats in office right now.
t1_dsslghw	0	*	BTC may view it that way but how do you think the US Fed views BTC?
t1_ds5dzq9	0	*	Then you don't believe in democracy. Be honest and own up to it. 
t1_dtf1qwg	0	*	So fuck these victims because there's not enough of them?
t1_dshdhi9	0	*	Thats how they literally view it. They hide their kids from gays and pedos, but they beat gays and kill pedos. Both are unnatural in their point of view.

t1_dv2n3tg	0	*	I didn't make that decision, my parents did.
t1_dv2j7xq	1	*	Depends on the time frame, regarding the last 20 years or so you are right.

t1_dujuaeo	1	*	Willingly working for the Trump squad.
t1_dujn2z7	0	*	When did I say he was prosecuted? Never, that's when. Nice try.
t1_dujwyni	1	*	More like please stop proving the other guys point.
t1_dujv2b8	1	*	Lmao if someone could make trump cry on national television all this bullshit would be worth it. 
t1_duk9ves	0	*	>Sure, sure...  So, just to be clear, you are saying there won't be anymore indictments, yes? Just asking for posterity's sake.
t1_dujqg8s	0	*	Couldn't we expect our totally unbiased fact checker to at least attempt objectivity? Just because you don't think trump is capable of nuance doesn't make what he actually said any less explicit
t1_duk1qip	0	*	At this point - what difference does it make?
t1_dujkwo3	0	*	The architect?
t1_dugkzjt	1	*	Thanks for the bat-compliment, I bat-guess
t1_dtk421z	1	*	I'm not exactly arguing, but no one *wants* to see themselves as deformed. It's an understandably tough pill to swallow.
t1_dtk28ez	0	*	it's not for religious reasons, most people in US do it because it's convention and the norm, don't want my little boy to be different to the others, want him to be like dad etc
t1_dtjr1pm	0	*	But you know circumcision was to prevent masturbation right? don't you think it was unnecessary if you are still masturbating?
t1_dtj8chd	0	*	First Amendment defeats your argument 10 times out of 10. It's a lost cause, let it go. Other people undergoing circumcision doesn't hurt you.
t1_dtk4qz6	1	*	So it's OK to circumcise a dementia patient against his will, since he won't remember the pain later?
t1_dtirkis	0	*	I dont research the circumcised penis as much as you do so I dont know. It just has all the characteristics of a controversial issue that they would take up. 
t1_dtjmhkc	0	*	Are tattoos mutilation? What about piercings? Mutilation implies harm.
t1_dtjzaxg	1	*	Probably because they are uncut. 
t1_dtiwbee	0	*	But regardless of medical need vs cosmesis, my dick looks the same afterwards. Therefore for one to be mutilation, they would both be mutilation. 
t1_dto2wqd	1	*	When it is aborted it isnt a person so theres no harm to anything that matters. When a baby is circumcised there is an effect on the man he will become, and he does matter. 
t1_dtjhxpf	0	*	Wait, so is genital cutting violence or not?
t1_dtjlung	0	*	By this definition, piercing a *babys* ears is also mutilation. FTFY
t1_dtjm4mw	0	*	If you read around the beginning, there are higher chances for UTI and possibly kidney problems if circumcision is done at an older age.
t1_dtj75ho	1	*	That's an overgeneralization
t1_dtiy5x0	0	*	You agree with being sexually mutilated without your consent? Ok then.
t1_dtixm89	0	*	I don't understand what difference it makes whether you remember it or not. 
t1_dtm5o3a	0	*	That doesn't really change the fact one of those comments is a lie and youbjust confirmed your first one to be exactly that with this comment. Why lie?
t1_dtlemv4	0	*	Oh honey, we're clearly done here. You don't even have the nerve to go to their website. If you don't care about a topic, don't pretend to.
t1_dtjmavg	0	*	Hypothetical drivel.
t1_dtkig55	1	*	Then he wouldn't be the guy who didn't get cut...  Commenter is talking about the uncircumcised folks in this thread going around talking about how only they know what real sex feels like.
t1_dtj5txb	0	*	I realize that I have one. Even if it is a little more of a hassle it shouldnt take that much longer.
t1_dtk0eyb	1	*	no babies don't get infections on their dick because they're in diapers all day, you don't even really product smegma or cheese until puberty
t1_dtj8fek	1	*	You're not really wrong, but its not exactly practical to jail every orthodox Jewish parent in the US. 
t1_dtl1l75	1	*	That says nothing about it's effectiveness in preventing STDs, which has been shown in studies. There are many factors that contribute. Can you provide a source for your claim it's less prevalent?
t1_dtjqqaq	1	*	I have stuck my dick right IN sugar. Didn't quell my desire AT ALL.  Good thing my GF liked it. Haha.
t1_dtjvo1v	1	*	Well hopefully weve avoided that
t1_dtk6fwm	1	*	Honestly didn't think that was gonna be a subreddit. I'll see you guys in a few hours...
t1_dtj5y76	1	*	If you don't see it, there's really not much I can do to help you.
t1_dtjmbjf	1	*	Sure was. Nazis and people who circumcise their kids oddly have a lot in common. 
t1_dtjibp2	0	*	No but the dekerintinzation of the penis head will revitalize the nerves that have been diminished by dead dry skin built up
t1_dtjlh8r	0	*	is rape of a baby okay if the baby doesn't remember it? of course not.  suffering is suffering, independent of memory.
t1_dtjx84v	0	*	And because you say it's wrong it is? Who decides what's wrong?
t1_dtjesj7	1	*	The medical answer is it's not needed for any medical purpose, not that it's harmful.  If you want to ban it for non medical or religious reasons I support that.
t1_dtkgsd2	0	*	Tumours have no benefits and are fatal. Foreskin improves sexual pleasure and helps reduce ED. Plus, foreskin removal is not time sensitive, unlike a tumour.
t1_dtk7eu9	0	*	Youre giving away your naivety.  Yes. I said it, i meant it, its true, and you can Google it yourself.  There are 4 types of FGM and 1 of those is ceremonial not surgical.
t1_dtjij5n	1	*	Governments tell people what to do to their kids all the time. They're called assault and battery laws.
t1_dtj5frx	0	*	why are you against freedom?
t1_dtjcjgr	0	*	The clitoral hood =/= the clitoris.  FGM removes both.
t1_dtjecrh	1	*	Exactly.
t1_dtjf5wl	0	*	Yes absolutely. You need a compelling reason to arrest people over religious activities. Otherwise you are just a nazi
t1_dtizbv1	1	*	I am pretty sure that we are talking about cosmetic circumcision.  Nobody is going to object circumcision due to medical reasons.
t1_dtjropl	0	*	what's in the needle?
t1_dtjclsp	0	*	The other people are your kids. Your kids are basically you for the first 3 or so years of their life.
t1_dtjhuwz	0	*	Its not true in every case but thats what the thinking behind it was heres the wiki page on the guy behind most of it. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harvey_Kellogg
t1_dtjphgo	1	*	that's the very point of ~~having~~ it.   Lets the reader see what they want.
t1_dtjluby	0	*	By this definition, piercing a *babys* ears is also mutilation. FTFY
t1_dtjyzuo	1	*	Idk. Cos most dildos are made in the US cos of the ED over there? ... God knows
t1_dtp22jw	0	*	So circumcision is so bad that it's worth kicking millions of people out of your country? You are not the only one there, they have the right to decide for their children, you do not
t1_dtk3qgc	0	*	In my opinion they are different. We choose circumcising for the cosmetic and sanitary benefits. We dont do it as punishment and to desensitize. 
t1_dtjhdlr	0	*	Ear piercings close and heal.  Foreskin doesn't grow back.   Mutilation is the right word for something irrevocable.  
t1_dtjpwvq	1	*	http://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/topics/fgm/overview/en/
t1_dtklm95	0	*	All sites that support a particular cause do that.   Do you have any counter arguments with citations as well?
t1_dtj7dbw	0	*	Lol try it....
t1_dtj77ss	0	*	And it's not a generalization to assume women prefer cut dicks because their toys are foreskinless?
t1_dtk5tui	1	*	It turns out the number was bullshit, but that is still a stupid comparison. 
t1_dtjjr9q	0	*	Sure but when you don't scrub everywhere and do it regularly, it can be dangerous. Better to get rid of the foreskin so you don't get to deal with that shit.
t1_dtjfs1k	1	*	I don't think you understand how medical circumcision works.  The penis is covered and protected by a metal device specifically so that this doesn't happen.
t1_dtkj92d	1	*	And this is one of the reasons why I don't pay much attention to old people haha.
t1_dtl8blq	1	*	Aren't religious traditions just grand?
t1_dtkg3gl	1	*	It's a faulty line of thinking that's very common with pro-circumcision arguments.
t1_dtix52j	1	*	You might want to look it up too, medical conditions aren't automatically hereditary.
t1_dtit4sk	0	*	Eh, Im just going to report you for being an uncircumcised penis and adding nothing to the conversation.
t1_dtj0gv0	1	*	Penis 
t1_dtj0c7g	1	*	But why do it to you at all? There was no guarantee you'd have the same issue. It's like removing your appendix because your mom had appendicitis.
t1_dtixhle	1	*	If your comment reflects your understanding of genetics the way it seems to, I'd assume you've only ever looked up genetics yourself...
t1_dtje50g	0	*	I don't think we should force any body modification on others. Would you want a child tattooed? Why pierce a child's ears?  Let the kid want it to be like Mom or big Sis and it's normal and fine.
t1_dtjgizl	0	*	No it isn't. And I said beat, not spank.
t1_dtjm4y4	0	*	Once again, comparing apples to oranges. Your point is moot, keep arguing your senseless arguments. You are acting like a goof.
t1_dtjhwfq	1	*	I had my ears pierced when I was 3.  Stopped wearing earrings in my late teens.  Its closed up now.  Would never know.
t1_dtkcw1n	1	*	>English letters  Roman alphabet, pleb.
t1_dtkh0tj	1	*	Shorter 
t1_dtjzpgg	1	*	you still felt it at the time, even if you don't remember it now  you most likely won't remember a huge traumatic accident resulting in a head injury, kind of irrelevant if you remember it or not
t1_dtjghj1	0	*	Lots of things are wrong and are still done, lots of things were wrong and were stopped being done. This should be one of those things 
t1_dtj7jsi	0	*	> Me: I like my dick...  Your very own words.
t1_dtjh0hn	0	*	My point is that you are making a false equivalency.  You respond to me by saying that my point is a false equivalency.  WTF?  
t1_dtisomt	1	*	Better, search /r/SubredditDrama specifically  https://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/search?q=circumcision&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=relevance&t=all
t1_dto21rf	1	*	My unscientific look on intimategadgets.com showed that most of their realistic dildos were designed with retracted foreskins, although two brands had circumcised models. 
t1_dtj1qx3	0	*	[And cutting your arm off reduces chance that you'll get cancer in that arm.](https://images.encyclopediadramatica.rs/0/07/Cutfag.jpg)
t1_dtj1gyh	1	*	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6490908  Btw with trauma I didn't mean that he gets PTSD from it as an adult or something like that, but there can still be some minor effects afterwards.
t1_dtjm9qv	1	*	Because the head of the penis is exposed and it's the most sensitive part. Similar to how a clitoris without a hood becomes numb from too much exposure. 
t1_dtkmvxz	0	*	I am circumcised. I have zero memory of it happening. Why should I feel bad about the way my dick looks? 
t1_dtj5vwq	0	*	Your comment is an insult to logic. You should be very happy your father didn't have any limbs amputated.
t1_dtlhy4p	1	*	> And if you cut off someone's genitalia, they can't have sex properly!   You sure about this? Circumcised males can have sex just fine haha
t1_dtji8xd	1	*	Smaller fold for you than most I'm sure. Frail little sickly Euro.
t1_dtl5tns	0	*	easily prevented by cleaning yourself
t1_dtl0mde	1	*	Speaking of retarded, I know *you* didn't say that.  I wasn't quoting you.  I was debating your assertion that *someone else* making that kind of dramatic statement is calling a spade a spade.
t1_dtjvm0q	0	*	You attacked them. Instead you can try and explain how you understand their potential reasoning, but times are changing. Also, those are incredibly orthodox rabbis. Most don't do that anymore
t1_dtld7vh	1	*	Any sources for that claim?

t1_dtka5an	1	*	Teach em young 
t1_dtjk8rq	1	*	You should visit r/foreskin_restoration to see everyone who doesn't like being circumcised.
t1_dto1ksn	1	*	In some countries it isnt anymore (Scotland was the most recent instance of a ban), and he said beat which implies more harm than spank. 
t1_dtiuflr	0	*	Well dont foreskins very in length? Some are shorter than others. Wouldnt that be an inconvenient anomaly if your foreskin is too long?  
t1_dt39qhg	0	*	Uh, no the US gives them $$$ for that.  Then Israel limits imports to Palestinians.
t1_dt1egui	0	*	Right. Especially when this is a brand new account that's a random assortment of numbers! Haha pathetic.   As for Reddit being left wing, I'm okay with that. As a liberal, I feel right at home.

t1_dt25x2y	0	*	It would hard for trump to be depressed about no longer being able to do something he has never done.
t1_dt0s95d	0	*	Right. I asked why is he investigating crimes that aren't related to Russian collusion because that's why the special investigator was ordered. It wasn't rhetorical. 
t1_dt19cx0	0	*	Fuck off with your bullshit talking points, Trump boi.
t1_dsioibs	0	*	How ????? They are basically the same to you in me. 
t1_dsixss4	0	*	When I say Indian I'm talking about regular brown indians, not southern ones  Would you say there's a difference between pakistanis punjabis and indians punjabis or more broadly other north indians ?
t1_dsjeyy0	0	*	Yeah and which among any of them speaks for even a quarter of all Muslims?  There is no Pope in Islam.  If there was, the world would probably be better for it.
t1_dsjz8fb	1	*	Ah OK. I was under the assumption that arranged marriages are commonly to older men or something. At least that's what the media makes it seem like.

t1_dtoq3dw	0	*	That was mainly among the upper elite. It beats slavery, jihad, child rape which is all present in Islam. Also, the hadeeth mandates intra cousin incest, so it isn't entirely free.

t1_dsyslx2	0	*	There you go calling them idiots again. When will liberals understand our right to not be oppressed by science. This is why trump won
t1_dsxwjcd	1	*	It has been overrun with UK pensioners.
t1_dukc8zi	0	*	But they knew that 1 person could replace 10 or 100. AI's will still need technicians.

t1_du17qz1	1	*	You don't subscribe to basic chemistry either it seems.
t1_dslowgg	0	*	Why do you deem animals to be more deserving of life than plants? They are living creatures too.
t1_dsk7hx2	0	*	Life preservation instinct. They sense danger, they try to escape it. Very basic and primal.
t1_dskq8fb	0	*	Well then you have made my argument even stronger! Its a cruel way to murder a human either way and its completely wrong. 
t1_dskg6fh	0	*	Yes, but only one that has been quenched in the blood of a thousand virgins.
t1_dskdiqh	0	*	People need to eat 
t1_dsz8xk4	0	*	India is not a third world country.  Sure, there's poverty just like in China, but they are an industrialized nation.  We're not talking shithole countries like in Africa.
t1_dsznppr	0	*	Butthurt Americans can't handle the truth.  ;)
t1_du20i3v	0	*	Do they round up and slaughter civilians?  Or what do you mean by attacking civilian targets?
t1_du93omg	0	*	> The pressure comes from the obvious injustice of the occupation  It's an obvious injustice is it? I don't think you quite understand the nature of antisemitism and victim playing in the Arab world.
t1_dua400m	1	*	I'm not arguing with them to change their minds, that's not possible. I'm just interested in what they'll say next.
t1_du97l3r	0	*	why did the embargo begin?  could it have been...the multiple bus bombings and various murders being committed regularly?
t1_du9icot	1	*	Just pointing out  , its pretty dumb to compare wrong doings
t1_du8pi2t	1	*	I don't think anecdotal cherry picked old clips in times of war are evidence of a prevalent phenomena, which is what sagester seemed to be suggesting.
t1_du8x5mc	1	*	But what type of person reads this source?
t1_du9iaoj	0	*	Oh, and how educated are you?
t1_du8jpu1	0	*	Yes, propaganda should be disregarded.  
t1_du9bnpj	0	*	> Was that about the time white Europeans started settling in Palestine/Jordan??? NO!  You are correct, no it wasn't.
t1_dua5xfq	0	*	It's a broad remark on the conditions of the children who are interrogated. It doesn't claim that those are sole cases.
t1_du99hm7	0	*	> unilaterally declareing a state without  LOL -- what do you think unilaterally means? Nations throughout the world immediately recognized the creation of Israel. 
t1_du9i9ti	0	*	Posted what?  Why should I find it?  I dont care
t1_du8re4m	0	*	Fallacy Fallacy. Your argument is invalid.  And that's even ignoring the fact that showing how a source is unbiased is not in fact an ad hominem.
t1_du96im8	1	*	I love your attempt to sound like you could give a fuck, it rings so hollowly that honest to god id have thought you were a drum.
t1_duys5kk	0	*	You need to go to school.
t1_dv0ss70	0	*	Yeah well apparently climate change and abortion is so why not the fact that there's a shadow government colluding to keep us in the dark?
t1_dv0xuwm	0	*	>No matter the terminology, it's a bribe. Everyone here knows it,  No. It's not. You're just incapable of nuance.
t1_dv0s413	0	*	Leaving the US?
t1_dv15ww1	0	*	It's the only plausible reason. They've done studies on every aspect of GMO farming.  
t1_dv0xj01	0	*	Do you think youll settle outside the US?
t1_dv0zc4q	1	*	Yeah, but if you're no longer exporting to those countries, that affects you too.  Also, you didn't address the clean energy argument. Or the more room to expand one. Or the nature reserve one.
t1_dv0tl1u	0	*	Nice rant... but you should get educated 
t1_dv0ztri	1	*	Brexit: making the UK the poster-child of if you get out of the EU, this is how you'll end up!.
t1_dv0xt3d	1	*	So are you trying to tell me that 1 doge = 1 doge?
t1_dv0uop1	1	*	Nice try Theresa

t1_dv20e1y	1	*	> provided they are organic pesticides... like neonicotinoids.  Which neonicotinoid is organic?
t1_dv19ecs	1	*	They have already extensively researched. More research will simply come to the same conclusions the release of the ban will not become any more logical. 
t1_dv0wprn	1	*	Amazing.  Some mysterious entity is pouring money into my shit. Oh well.
t1_dv0qrby	0	*	They built a nice wall.
t1_dv1dc4q	0	*	So, to be clear, the US as a whole has *not* banned it?
t1_dv11xef	1	*	Aye, kick the colonial scum out and take what's ours.
t1_dv16kzo	0	*	This is a very broad generalization. Have you not considered conservative voters who simply agree with conservative fiscal policies (i.e. lower tax rates)? 
t1_dv0rbwi	0	*	Youre probably less likely to die from a terrorist attack in Europe simply because the healthcare is better and wont indirectly kill you afterwards.
t1_dv12i3y	1	*	I thought it meant breakfast
t1_dv1jrb1	1	*	Isn't that a definition of oligarchy? 
t1_dv2kgei	0	*	Calling you a fascist, not the EU.
t1_dv0qaw3	0	*	Seeds are already patented in an identical manner. If you're buying seeds from a random farmer, GMO or not, you're most likely breaking your contract.
t1_dv0wdk9	1	*	>Simple: Brexit means Brexit! /s  The first rule of tautology club is the first rule of tautology club. 
t1_dv0sjtm	1	*	Your point is moot if it cannot ever be done to anything.   You can never prove without a reasonable doubt.  Not for anything anywhere. 
t1_dv0yx37	0	*	''Soviet Russia was as progressive as it gets''  Ok
t1_dv15urd	0	*	That is dumb as fuck. They get paid to not farm to help the local environment right? Fuck farmers for literally shitting on their local environments.
t1_dv1isil	1	*	What argument did I put forth that served as the straw man?
t1_dv0vy8h	0	*	False pretenses. 
t1_dv0u2pp	0	*	It seems like most of those changes would make agriculture wildly less efficient. Also, why in the hell would competitor farmers chip in to save your failed crops? 
t1_dv1h26k	0	*	As far as I'm aware, the super rich (Bill Gates, Warren Buffet) tend to skew liberal.  Who are you referring to?
t1_dv0xzvf	1	*	On a percentage level yes, it's a very complicated deal it comes down to about a 25-30% discount on EU membership no one else gets.
t1_dv173gk	1	*	And sometimes stupid rich people too
t1_dv20hzf	0	*	Fingers crossed, I hear Soylent^TM is the Future^TM !!!
t1_dv1vawx	1	*	Blasphemy!
t1_dv11jrm	1	*	Much appreciated
t1_dv0pg37	1	*	Exactly, we don't like to bring up the fish tomato thing though, it never actually became a product that people could eat.
t1_dv2padd	1	*	Yeah let's see how that goes, Pol Pot.

t1_dv0t9hy	1	*	Hmm... TIL.
t1_dv3a8rw	0	*	Damn - thats genuinely a surprise to know.  Thanks for sharing, bud
t1_dv0vj2j	1	*	There's not a lot of evidence of that in crops aside from the tDNAs in sweet potato.
t1_dv0tpw9	1	*	Thanks. I meant to fix that, but was far too lazy
t1_dv0xaus	0	*	Do you believe the people that are denying climate change are science deniers?  
t1_dv0td2p	0	*	Good Maybot?
t1_dv127dl	0	*	Or they shouldn't have held a referendum, or said that any less than 2/3rds or whatever would be considered a win for 'remain'.
t1_dv1pne0	1	*	Right, my thoughts exactly!
t1_dv0uyvz	1	*	I will leave you to enjoy your happiness bubble of ignorance then.
t1_dv0xllw	0	*	No, we are the third highest net contributor. We just pay less than we might have done.
t1_dv0zbs4	1	*	You don't think that the expert will be unbiased completely in their presentation? Almost always the expert is an employee of a company in that field.
t1_dv0xp4d	0	*	How do you decide who the expert is and how he's hired? Likely, it will be industry leaders anyway, and you're back to where you started.
t1_dv1gf3l	1	*	And when they evolve we make a new vaccine, our bodies recognize it and it works again. Like we do with flu every year.
t1_dv0xn7f	0	*	>Thats why you vote For people that know on the matters they attend  You'd have to have 500 people for one elected position with this approach. 
t1_dv0ucwt	1	*	Not really. The chance of a crop planted by farmers in managed fields running roughshod over nature is about a the same as the sun rising in the North.
t1_dv0s5tn	1	*	Dunno who downvoted me then. Some little flower sensitive about his identity I guess.
t1_dv10u9j	0	*	Ah the old cut off the nose to spite the face
t1_dv0pn9u	0	*	Exactly, and that is the farmers fault for re-using seed that they signed saying the would not.
t1_dv0vur7	0	*	Woah, thank you! How's the taste usually?
t1_dv0rayu	0	*	Why are GM foods labeled and regular foods not labeled? The same rules should apply to both.
t1_dv2c2aa	0	*	Dihydrogen monoxide* It's H2O not HO2
t1_dv0vvkc	1	*	Nah, we're just best friends. Nothing more, but certainly nothing less. 
t1_dv0p2o1	0	*	You are completely right, but plants breed though conventional methods do not have to go through the same hoops as transgenic (gmo) crop.
t1_dv0v2qd	1	*	So just put a hard border in the Irish sea.  Oh wait, the DUP already vetoed that one.
t1_dv141ke	1	*	No. It wasnt. 
t1_dv0s1p9	0	*	I'm totally with you on this one. The question is what kind of world government, the way democracy is organized within it, and so on.
t1_dv0u0n6	0	*	Like we need a hole in the head.  That's the kind of thing that would need a supermajority of voters in both the Republic, and NI, to agree on.
t1_dv0vzy5	0	*	Bro a fucking Democrat won in Alabama and another is closing the gap in Texas. Unless the mood changes considerably he is not gonna be favored (he could still win)
t1_dv0xo95	1	*	It could be a viable alternative in the future.  It is not a viable alternative now.  That's an important distinction.
t1_dv2fau8	1	*	It definitely does, I used to send the letters out.  
t1_dv15ogk	1	*	Plus the fucking Daily Mail. So many people I know who voted conservative just because they thought Jeremy was a weak communist 
t1_dv19b5y	0	*	The same could be said of progressists imo. They put a lot of faith in their political figures too. That's a common human issue and not just s conservative issue
t1_dv0ypa0	1	*	It's really just a matter of needing a term to fill a roll, i.e. the set of techniques that let us make specific genome alterations.
t1_dv0rxnw	0	*	Well the yoga mat thing is actually a quote from that bimbo so I wouldnt doubt it. 
t1_dv0v469	0	*	Gibraltar will remain, they'll just starve unless they bend the knee to Spain.
t1_dv10nqb	0	*	Thanks I am going to be trying out for the olympics wish me luck.
t1_dv0sv6d	1	*	I think the idea that a global government has being hiding the fact the earth is flat from the entire world's population has some quite drastic political consequences.

t1_dv0zklu	1	*	They make sense for _the world_, which, last time I checked, Europe was a part of.  Sorry, but I really can't agree with your opinion: Europe should definitely improve its agricultural business.
t1_dv0snwb	0	*	Nope.  Again, you seem to want an argument.
t1_dv1h3zz	1	*	The Irish mostly don't want us to get fucked, they want us to stop fucking with them.
t1_dsvpjgj	0	*	Sure , yes my name is Eyal and im from Israel gj you are really smart understanding it. I think you need to start using logic instead of telling others to use it
t1_du90o0r	0	*	[k.](https://youtu.be/7pdWAcK6Eh8)
t1_du8xam6	0	*	No worries mate, it's always nice to disprove the stereotype of Germans not being nice, because at least some of us are^^
t1_du9zwes	1	*	New York has 8 million people and even more in the metropolitan area. I can understand that it sucks. Wouldnt even want to live in a city with so many people car or no car.
t1_du8tcj7	1	*	I wonder if we could actually measure that somehow. I agree that more touching/proximity implies more transmissions.
t1_dua2n0w	1	*	Well obviously you don't want to die, but for the planet less humans is most likely better. I'm not going to say we should kill ourselves, just noting a fact.
t1_duakvg9	1	*	Apparently piracy is ineffective against highway robbers.
t1_du98nib	1	*	That's what you feel at first, until you realize that you need to get in on the money grab yourself.  \#DOW30k
t1_du8i0mg	0	*	Oh, I was talking about normal train. In Seoul you get normal trains that frequent. Trams are quite normal I'd say with 5-10min and metro is the same.
t1_duego1x	1	*	Okay. I figured that just like any oher big city, there's places that it's better to not walk around (by yourself) in ar night.
t1_duwi0vn	0	*	I mean american men *are* pussys... what armed cop doesnt protect school kiddies? an *american* one!  
t1_duwgzbu	0	*	So you're 12/13... single mother... whores herself out every night so you've no father figure so you let the internet absorb all your time while being morbidly obese... yup
t1_duwi9b7	0	*	You're still talking
t1_duv8f6d	0	*	See, I would have no issue with OP saying they have some of the lowest GDP in the EU. That would be objectively, technically, right. But to say they're the worst countries is just ignorance. 
t1_duv0lld	0	*	Spoiler: *nothing* hes making a straw man 
t1_duwa03w	0	*	Like the cop who actually has a weapon but decided he was a coward and would let kids die? Bahahahha
t1_dv0w27q	0	*	Those would be the Habsburgs of which I am referring to.
t1_ds2bac8	0	*	Because different brains, up bringing, other physiological differences etc
t1_ds2c6z2	0	*	Because my wife is genetically engineered by nature to raise children.  It is her purpose in life and I let her do it.  I really only exist to enable that.  
t1_dum5hef	1	*	A handshake is appeasement now?
t1_dulbeym	0	*	Then your knowledge of history sucks.
t1_dulhs5g	1	*	Talk is cheap in america so cheap its even free.... worthless. 
t1_dulpcx7	1	*	And I'm guessing a good chunk of those that did vote for him only voted for him because the opposition was so damn weak. Doesn't exactly excuse it but theres also that.
t1_dul0c9z	1	*	Yes we demolish all baked goods. It's why even our body size is more impressive than that of the malnourished North Koreans.
t1_dul77v1	0	*	Oh no, they still genocide their own people. But they also abuse their own people. Why not both? 
t1_duludy5	0	*	Ive thrown out no fact or reason. Good effort though. 
t1_dul3tzx	1	*	Good. Glad we cleared that up. In the future, you might find www.thesaurus.com useful.
t1_dulpt0h	1	*	WTF? You think SK attacked NK unwarranted? I hope I'm not fully understanding what you're saying.

t1_dulndws	0	*	Thats a lot 
t1_dupke8c	1	*	That's too much.
t1_dt6jh1y	1	*	That's interesting. But, also take note, the blaster was made in response to Johannesburg. That city makes most of Cape Town look like a safe haven in comparison.
t1_dt6wbe4	1	*	You don't just dig a shallow hole like you would if you shit in the woods while camping. You dig a deep hole and build a basic outhouse
t1_dtailk1	0	*	Nationalisation of massive natural resources rarely works out well. What's needed is foreign investment, corruption crackdown, and education expansion.
t1_dtaxs2g	0	*	Jesus. If you think the UK is that influential, or that the Anglican church has a significant impact on what the UK government does you are beyond hope.
t1_duh74ux	0	*	Car accidents. 
t1_duh6fam	0	*	You can still live life without your car. Get off your high horse.
t1_du8lgbb	0	*	My point isn't going to change.  Instead of sitting here trying to invent an argument, if you don't like what I have to say, just block me.  It's really simple.  Here, I'll demonstrate.  
t1_dtlo4y5	0	*	So, what thing that I said is making you so angry to curse at me? 
t1_dtadpyj	1	*	Acknowledge that it is the fault of China. 
t1_duq4r5c	0	*	If you knew anything about Sanders' position, it was that the sanctions were not enough in his opinion.  Also, it doesn't matter because it was massively (like 98%) voted in favor anyway.
t1_dugjwz3	0	*	Do they have a breaking point?      Where is it?
t1_duhe7bh	1	*	For like what, two hours of a single day? 
t1_dugeo4f	0	*	How else are you supposed to make decisions? Foresight is important.
t1_dugtyjy	0	*	Post graduate degree, six figure income, managed not to vote for Trump... nothing special, really.  I was the lead in my high school musical?
t1_duh8eug	1	*	We weren't at breaking point, The US is more fucked up than we were when we impeached.
t1_dugldzm	0	*	Martial Law will be implemented if Trump gets away with this. That's when the real pain is going to begin for society.
t1_duii3lt	0	*	Yeah! How dare he insult us like that!  It's really just because most of us take the right to free speech and assembly for granted, and are too stupid and/or lazy to be bothered!
t1_dugekyq	0	*	No even speculation, she was gonna put a no fly zone over Syria.
t1_dugo1k9	0	*	I feel like thats the opposite of what Ive always heard
t1_duger99	1	*	I love George Carlin, but people who didn't vote and wanted Hilliary to win still went out and protested and complained.
t1_duggxc0	0	*	They weren't making arrests because the people who knew about it were directly benefiting from the interference. 
t1_duhdfw3	0	*	As a former NRA member I've got a huge justice hard-on to have this be true.
t1_dugp3us	0	*	What about the aliens and stuff? Or the russian/china-inside-job conspiracy?  Havent there been any new conspiracy popping up? SocialMediaConspiracy, FlatEarthConspiracy?

t1_duhllb6	0	*	He said November. Midterm is not in November. 
t1_dugnxfl	0	*	Trump is smart enough to keep up the appearance of impartiality. When the deal goes through than your point is debate worthy. Right now it's just talk
t1_duh8fd0	1	*	I hope you are right. 
t1_duh2i6l	1	*	Get him for unpaid taxes
t1_dugom0t	1	*	When does that come into existence. I'm guessing 2011. 
t1_dugdtro	0	*	Not even a little.

t1_dsgw51p	0	*	BAHAHAHAHAHA that is hilarious. 
t1_ds3urrq	0	*	How could you know what the right side is if you don't even know what it is. You are supporting following the crowd which is far more dangerous.

t1_du13ebv	1	*	Not from a Jedi.
t1_du16e1w	1	*	And its weird. Because the US and the US economy BOOMED under Clinton. The country was in really great shape when he left office.  Its that god damn blowjob, all the hate comes from that one incident.
t1_du12cxt	1	*	The Onion's articles on Bannon are the best thing they've ever done

t1_du3gcva	1	*	She would almost certainly beat him but I don't think she will be nominated again. 
t1_du15sx2	1	*	I honestly don't think he's in it for the money. Pretty sure it's a beneficial side effect for him
t1_du11yn0	1	*	You're both misrepresenting what she said and omitting the fact that she was right. 
t1_du179hn	1	*	There's a bigger chance that Oprah will genuinely be the next president than to actually change the Electoral College.
t1_du20hch	0	*	Well... yeah. Really.
t1_du17g0r	1	*	In hos mind, the laws of nature are whatever he wants them to be. Science is meaningless. Gut feelz are much more reliably accurate.
t1_du21fu7	1	*	Both sides at their throats is pathetic. I don't know what has gotten into either of you. Grow up and stop hating your fellow Americans. We are stronger united.
t1_dswzltj	0	*	Not sure what your point is.  Migration rate is absolute number entering per year.  Net migration rate is the same minus the number leaving.
t1_dsvtvsu	1	*	you're making a false equivalency between Islam and Nazi.
t1_dswy92p	0	*	I want talking about the pope I'm talking about Jesus and what he taught.  The fact that so so many are missing that is really just driving my point home
t1_dswafiz	0	*	I figured I would answer your bullshit strawman with another. If you don't like it maybe worldnews where everything is posted in a sad attempt to attack Trump is not for you. 
t1_dsxe4rq	0	*	The Vatican is it's own country. If they even move you to rome that means you were deported 
t1_dsxf6ua	0	*	What the fuck are you talking about 
t1_dsvrq31	0	*	You weaken its draw; you make it harder for them to see you as *other*. Consider it simply as psychological warfare, if you like.
t1_dswrpat	0	*	It is the only direct line back to it with the first pope being St Peter, a disicple of Jesus, creating a direct line back to the founder of christianity.
t1_dswqux4	0	*	Sure...but St. Paul's is my personal preference
t1_dsvwcve	1	*	You know that Nazism ABSOLUTELY isn't a left wing ideology, right?
t1_dteo7mj	1	*	It's fine. I was unreasonably angry the whole time anyway.
t1_duexg3g	0	*	Everything I just mentioned was a result of him.  How about handling North Korea by actually following through with sanctions and restoring the holy city to Israel.    
t1_dsmo8ha	0	*	Instead of using the word communist to imply someone is unpatriotic (see senator McCarthy) now people call someone socialist to do the same thing.
t1_dsms7od	0	*	No, not at all, the first comment was what I was pointing out to you, appears you didn't have common sense to understand it.

t1_ds6blkn	0	*	So it's officially listed at 1.6%, but your source for it being 7% is that there will likely be a lot of corruption. and its problably pretty complex

t1_ds3kd3w	0	*	So you're worrying about your mommy needing to service those fighting in Korea?
t1_dtrgqpd	0	*	Yes, we all know it's harmful to the British, but it's what they wanted.  The EU needs more financial integration, which wouldn't have happened with the British.
t1_dtqo5b5	1	*	Maybe. May still considered them a wastes vote because of the 2 party politics we appear to be moving to, but fair enough. I thought you meant something else.

t1_dtqr2a7	1	*	I wonder if they all do live in Texas?
t1_dtq6rq6	0	*	It's different. When German people come here they say they are from Germany. French people say they are from France. They don't identify as 'Europeans'.
t1_dtrgpu8	1	*	Perhaps, but there's also a chance that people are projecting their anger on those with schadenfreude for the British onto me, someone who claimed it was best for everyone.  I'll be a dick to that.

t1_ds4c0eh	0	*	For real. Tell me where to buy that apocalypse property, baby. 
t1_ds44n4r	0	*	All of those stories were speculation, though. Nobody presented it as if it were fact. So nobody should be allowed to speculate, is that what you're saying? 
t1_ds40pqh	1	*	*Googles Felix Sater*  *Googles Deutche bank*  
t1_ds459ab	0	*	Elsewhere in this thread, you called someone an 'edgelord' and accused someone else of being 12 years old.   And then you made the Idiocracy comparison.   The irony. 
t1_ds4dm2z	1	*	Obviously people disagree
t1_ds48cv4	0	*	Radiolab removing this podcast is why trump won.   People complained the podcast was hate speech and they caved instantly and took it down.

t1_ds48y91	0	*	Lol what is this we?
t1_ds451ct	0	*	Don't worry, there is a scenario where all life dies.  So it's not a binary.
t1_ds465kx	0	*	Perhaps it's time to fight fire with fire. It's obvious we're not the dangerous ones here.
t1_ds42cf1	0	*	Yea, but it's a Pascal's wager type of situation. The outcome, however unlikely, is so horrible that it's not worth risking. 
t1_dsbczaw	0	*	Well considering that 10k km is 4 days of uninterrupted driving I expect most people to fly 
t1_dsbfxxw	0	*	How do you know this?  Do you realize that hurricane numbers and strength are virtually unchanged since the 1800s?  One would think that all that CO2 would massively increase those numbers...nope
t1_dsbic9c	0	*	Solar, wind, electric vehicles.  Rinse and repeat until 100%.
t1_dsc1j6q	0	*	Overland is a generic term for non-air travel so it includes sea travel.
t1_dsbkzn4	1	*	We dont even have to go that far. There are several voting systems, most of which are better than the first-past-the-post winner-take-all bullshit we have now. 
t1_dsbfqd0	0	*	> What good is reef if we can't see it?  Coral reefs play a vital role in the globe's ecosystem. They aren't there solely as a tourist attraction.
t1_dsg3knf	0	*	And unfortunately all, I mean all, those things are still going on, only much much more extreme.  Humans are being sold for flesh and organs.

t1_dv1ku6o	0	*	Hello there
t1_dv1o2fi	0	*	No, I don't think theres realistically much worse he can do from his own perspective.  I think backing down from building the wall could top it, in terms of alienating his own base.
t1_dv2cnzs	1	*	We don't get many decent places that sell quality cooked food, so we have to rely on brands that are unlikely to close compared to our small joints.
t1_dv2cnzd	1	*	Sounds like Turkey's Erdogan...

t1_dv1rlly	0	*	Pipe fitter / welder $89 an hour.
t1_dv1p2uz	0	*	My point was its not about what you pay, it's about who you pay. In this case instead of focusing on campain funds, he was just outright paying people in the government. 
t1_dv1rnbx	0	*	It kind of is, though? Nostalgia is about being wistful and sentimental, which carries strong implications of not being totally accurate
t1_dv1l8za	0	*	Memory has a natural form of selection bias where bad events are not remembered as well or recalled as easily as positive events.
t1_dv20cmt	0	*	Yep. But the point was about who the aggressor would be. If you steal something someone else owns I'd say you would then be the aggressor. 
t1_dv1n3n7	0	*	Because they ban everybody else.

t1_dv1o7wz	0	*	The Democrats are polling better in the generic ballot than Republicans right now. 
t1_dv27bhz	1	*	I get it the tarrif is not good I disagree with it. You however start off with the hole tired line of The President not being an adult so fuck off you're argument is null

t1_dv234j8	1	*	Not California... Dems arent the party in power so putting pressure on an industry in California doesnt do much. 
t1_dv272xs	1	*	The people suggesting this have no interest in the welfare of the vast majority of the British population.  It is a way for them to pay less tax and make more money only.
t1_dv1qtgh	1	*	Thats how the Republican primary became the debacle it was.  And here we are  
t1_dv24d7q	0	*	> Lol I didn't vote for him, nor did anybody I know  Then i wasn't talking to you nor anyone you know. Have a nice day.
t1_dv2c0ph	1	*	Sounds like one of those Sci-Fi civilisations that are the last on earth and seem perfect, but something is off.

t1_dv1w8wo	1	*	You replied to the wrong comment, you must have meant to reply to u/flincher14
t1_dv1pxra	1	*	What would you have them do? Not respond? Roll over?
t1_dv2baqe	1	*	So a grammatical error means you can't have a civilised discussion.  A grammatical error means you can refute what OP is saying. Very mature.   
t1_dv1x9jx	0	*	It is clearly a tongue in cheek joke in the video. The whole video, not the clipped version that made the Facebook rounds.
t1_dv1s7ql	0	*	Do you think this is a participation issue?
t1_dv1wr77	1	*	Ahh, I was trying to figure out what the ENT meant, thank you!  Though Ents are great conversationalists, their small talk just takes decades.
t1_dv29986	0	*	> enhancing business transparency which is why MNCs love the fuck out of Singapore.  Does MNC mean multinational companies? Wouldn't they be against such measures?  
t1_dv2ef71	1	*	Tax cuts. From what I've heard, Trumps/GOP's tax package has been widely anticipated in business circles.
t1_dv29v25	0	*	I think this is it.  Faced with the russian scandal he needs a diversion. Needs to look 'presidented'.  Needs to look like he's actually doing something.   It's a PR stunt. 
t1_dv1w5zd	1	*	It was cold as fuck that week too. I was not happy. 
t1_dv2k8hw	1	*	Sure, they wouldn't collapse though.  Because remember than with all the financial hit, they would have a massive downsizing to reduce the costs.  It would hurt the people a lot more than the company.
t1_dv27f5l	1	*	Jesus where is that?  In Vancouver with a level 1 ticket I was at $20 an hour right out of school. Journeyman were at $35.
t1_dv1sra1	0	*	In Montana, can confirm. Cows all over hills, munch munch munch.

t1_dv25noe	1	*	True, I just see a very close, not 100%, correlation to location of business and the health-care, retirement match, and others things provided and general attitude. 
t1_dv1ze0u	1	*	That's a good point, and you are probably right to point out who wrote the article to give context. I still think the article gives great insight into what op was talking about.
t1_dv1yzzm	1	*	Of course they get to.   But here's the thing: as an American, the American officials have a *duty* to prevent it from being successful.   What I'm seeing now is a dereliction of duty. 
t1_dv1vuhm	0	*	I'm just surprised it took this long for someone to point that out
t1_dv1qsx4	0	*	Edit: sorry I forgot I was on world news...  Fuck Trump! It's his fault for global warming and the hurricanes anyway!
t1_dv1qvk2	0	*	Don't forget to count the NRA, Kochs, Fox, Russia etc. that all campaigned for him
t1_dv1okhb	1	*	Have they already put T_D back together after the purge?
t1_dv1zj5c	1	*	It still gets sent to the Midwest to be fattened/butchered. We have no slaughterhouses that can handle volume in Montana

t1_dv1rzf2	0	*	Ryan would have lost re-election if they hadn't gerrymandered the shit out of the districts. 
t1_dv232mj	1	*	Probably because their meth dont add up.

t1_dv255jx	0	*	Alberta and Ontario for sure.
t1_dv24onk	1	*	Actually I think they are not swing states,  therefor the have less power,  same with NY,  IL,  CA,  and TX. But OH,  PA and FL are different stories. 
t1_dv1urv2	0	*	The mid-term elections are not far away. See what happens then.
t1_dv2br1b	1	*	You are right. 
t1_dv1k8dk	0	*	Thats cute you are still stuck to a time 20 years ago when the sole US was the ruler of the world, times do change even if you people wanna hold on to the past

t1_dv1pvpr	0	*	You don't have to pay when the MSM gives you countless hours of free airtime.
t1_dv35lo3	0	*	But, I wasn't. Being disappeared doesn't necessarily mean killed.
t1_dv3047b	1	*	The latest polls show he is at 37.7 percent approval right now. That's barely moved from the 39 percent from when he won. I'd say he is still very popular.
t1_dv1uj74	1	*	You like Pence so much?
t1_dv1ppf8	0	*	Other than the actual civil war for that very reason right?
t1_dv2moeq	1	*	I'm pretty sure most fasteners meeting aircraft standards are still made here in the USA.

t1_dv1urhh	1	*	No, DeLorean.
t1_dv1nsqf	1	*	what about his taxes?
t1_dv1tcfl	1	*	They have also often lost the overall vote in the House but retained massive majorities thanks to ridiculous gerrymandering. But no, the system is totally fine.
t1_dv1q4mk	1	*	Didn't you hear? They already built it! The wall's made out of rivers and mountains and shit. And Mexico paid for it 500 million years ago during continental drift. Suckers.
t1_dv30fuc	1	*	You don't have to support the NRA to believe that seizing guns without due process is a bad thing.   It's called common sense.

t1_dv1mno6	1	*	Poverted what a fucking joke lmao
t1_dv284hu	1	*	Its a big problem even here in Canada, especially in the residential sector. Our IBEW local here has practically no companies involved in residential because at IBEW wages they cant compete for jobs.
t1_dv23w6s	1	*	Racism and total denial about their own personalities as far as I can tell.
t1_dv1iyff	1	*	The world economy is also chained to the British and Dutch economies.

t1_dt0hojn	0	*	Then she gets the penalty for killing an innocent man. Sucks to suck, but maybe don't be a vigilante next time. 
t1_dt0h285	0	*	Actually there is an advantage. Depending on the prison itself and the justice system and corruption, they have a chance to escape and do it again.   The death sentence gets rid of that chance.
t1_dt0jg7a	0	*	Sure, but not by the usual definition of murder.
t1_dt0i0q4	1	*	So its ok for these people to blow up innocents that have nothing to do with the Iraq war because their government decided to get oil thirsty?
t1_dt1x25o	1	*	The Islamic State was no less of a country than Yemen in 2014-2015. Acknowledging them is an easy way to deny consular support IMO.

t1_dt0k54t	0	*	> Who defines a terrorist organisation? Is the IS a terrorist organisation? Yes.  K, end of story there. She did try to join a terrorist organization.
t1_dt1wsl5	1	*	Don't forget the fact that it's also a war-torn country. That reality is often ignored by many.  
t1_dt0mt9i	0	*	Yeah, its foolish to think of all the innocent people Isis killed in barbaric ways. We should just make up and be friend's! /s

t1_dugjsjf	0	*	I agree, Israel is about 95% white if you do not count the occupied zones which are basically concentration camps. Israel lacks diversity, it shouldn't be such a racist country in this day and age.

t1_dug9kuo	0	*	Yes you're correct. However the person you replied to made a simple mistake and you got all in their ass about it. 
t1_dugczfs	0	*	Oh you mean a place where a portion of citizens can vote for representation?
t1_dugec6u	0	*	Israel has a population of 8m, roughly the same (maybe even less) than NYC. Not NYC Metro, not New York State, but NYC.  37000 people would be about the size of the 50th largest city. 
t1_dugg4us	0	*	Those are the same refugees we have here in Europe, will you stop lying, you deceiving imp ?
t1_dugi5wz	1	*	No they hate each other as well. They hate themselves for being white just as much.

t1_dskmu8o	0	*	157k isnt taxed at 40%. Do you know how progressive tax works? Youre a lawyer and you dont understand effective tax rate?  Ok.
t1_dskovrl	1	*	I disagree, avocados are a great source of healthy fats
t1_dsktd48	0	*	As a non-financial type working a basic tech job, what does that mean for me or any of my co-workers? Is there any advantage to this outside of money doing interesting new things and not crashing?
t1_dskpsaj	0	*	Yes it is, the US elects by voting span on majority. If a larger area votes for Trump he will win

t1_dtzmxor	1	*	Brilobing
t1_dtzqcwu	1	*	Oh sorry I thought you were vegan
t1_du0j9ts	0	*	The thing is, that I also dont know what Im eating in Mc Donald and KFC, or those store packaged food.
t1_dtzmyuo	0	*	There's absolutely nothing inherently wrong with eating animals 
t1_dtzkt5h	0	*	The perfect is not the enemy of the good. It's actually easier to avoid eating animals than it is to avoid having a smartphone with the current work/social demands in modern western society.
t1_dtzkycy	1	*	Also, political donations.
t1_dtzkmy3	0	*	Surely we need to look at the victims here, which are the animals rather than Italians having their culture supposedly spat on   Ive had vegan Kung Pao chicken and it was delicious btw
t1_dtzjhev	1	*	Clarice?
t1_du1j8bn	1	*	Well put
t1_du4sf8f	0	*	Context, dude!
t1_dtzqs9c	1	*	No, the EU can keep its horrific animal abuse, thanks.

t1_du0gs21	0	*	I do not like KFC.
t1_dtzsw4t	0	*	We give the death penalty as the harshest punishment possible for those that have greatly harmed others. Serial killers and pedophiles deserve that suffering.   Cows, pigs and chickens are innocent. 
t1_du02wyf	1	*	No problem. It's a topic people are passionate about. I definitely think we're on the same side. 
t1_dtzkfhn	0	*	Meat is not sustainable, look at the environmental damage and pollution caused by the meat industry. Culture is not morally perfect. Your other example is asinine.
t1_dtzroqf	1	*	You're absolutely right. Also, props for being the first guy to have that username. 
t1_du4pe0g	1	*	If done correctly, for sure. I don't believe we can count on these companies doing anything that takes time correctly and you may disagree.Regardless, thanks for the insight 
t1_dtzoxz1	1	*	I had another comment about how killing animals is cruel. There is no exception. I referred to that with that line.  Thought I was commenting to someone else, and for that I am sorry. 
t1_dtzqp1m	0	*	This isn't in the US. 
t1_du02ohn	1	*	Yep, but it is easier to get it from eating processed meat than processed plants or even homegrown plants. The amounts you get from plants probably won't harm you, but you get more of it from meat.  
t1_du0aunp	0	*	Yep. 
t1_du12d7s	0	*	That's a fair point. However, you could set the limit at only eating organic pasture raised meat rather than no meat at all.. 
t1_dtzvq88	1	*	Lol Ill take your 21 bucks little man
t1_dtzxhho	0	*	Humans have been eating meat for thousands of years and will continue to do so until our extinction. I love all the hate I'm getting even though I haven't said one bad word against vegans or veggies. 
t1_dtzv1hm	0	*	Humane killing and abusive killing are both still killing, that's the bottom line.  Consuming meat always means death. Until lab grown meat will become a household item that's the reality of it.
t1_dtzl6uc	1	*	Hmm today I learned. I've always thought veganism refers specifically to the diet.
t1_dtzwij1	1	*	Why?  You don't know me.  Keep your pity for those who need it.
t1_dtzzfiz	1	*	Your cruelty will only propagate further cruelty. There's so much Darkness in the world, be part of the lights, in words and deeds.
t1_du0wscs	0	*	You know the corn that cows eat is way different than the one we eat? There are many types of corns.
t1_dtzlr8c	0	*	Question, what's evolutionary biases do you think we've given up? 
t1_dtzimeg	0	*	Well, congratulations.  I did 100% soylent for about six months, and while I did get a good bit healthier, my social life suffered quite a bit for it because I wasn't going out nearly as much.
t1_dtzrpmg	0	*	There needs to be a /r/makeitabouttheUS sub. 
t1_du1yy1k	0	*	.. and the animals.
t1_dtzppw6	1	*	So if you were, for example, driving down the highway and there was a dog in the road, you're saying that it would be just as ethical to hit the dog then to run over some grass?
t1_du01lcu	1	*	Who said that you have to eat high amount of meat anyways?  You can combine eat together with vegetables, I don't see any reasons why you should exaggerate for the worst. 
t1_dtzino4	0	*	Good thing memory is erased once they are dead, right?
t1_dtzl4qz	0	*	No because we share the same species. The same reason why we have collectively sad cannibalism is wrong. We shouldnt subject our own species to suffering.
t1_du0pw8y	1	*	I agree with you that the suffering of living things is indecent and should hold some weight in decisions around livestock
t1_du018x3	0	*	Poultry & Pork I already know that factory farming is incredibly common, I was just stating that for cattle the vast majority of intensive farming is for dairy rather than Beef.
t1_du07z1y	0	*	Most of us need technology in order to succeed in modern society, but that's not true of eating meat.
t1_dtzksnq	0	*	Right, where are your facts? 
t1_du5uyog	0	*	Well yeah, either that or you weren't eating adequately. The idea that meat must be part of a complete meal is pretty ingrained in our culture.
t1_dtzkqjt	0	*	When you come down from your high horse maybe you can join us other lowly humans and enlighten us all!  
t1_dtzptae	0	*	You made a huge generalization about everyone who is pro-life. I am pro-life, but probably not the monster you expect me to be.
t1_du013pd	1	*	[Look at my canines!](https://i.imgur.com/XlXtK3h.png)
t1_dtzvp6l	1	*	easy on the edge mister social darwinist.
t1_dtzzu64	1	*	As long as the people are not purchasing this product, it will diminish and more vegan options will surface. It's supply and demand.
t1_dtzsu03	0	*	The most advantageous strategy is to stop consuming animals. Reducing consumption is better than increasing it, but it isn't better than stopping all together. You're wrong, sorry. 
t1_du0ia78	0	*	Not really, food stamps cover rice, beans, bread, potatoes, and oatmeal.  Pretty sure Amazon delivers w/ EBT cards, or most of these foods are available everywhere.
t1_du2z8w3	0	*	So what if we give the animal a pill that makes it fall asleep then die, pain-free and no blood. Never even knows it's dying, just like a plant.
t1_dtzr5f4	0	*	Wait...is that second quote implying that the whistleblowers are guilty until proven innocent?
t1_du1qsqf	1	*	Still high in carbs and lower in calories. You can google it.
t1_dtzqp7z	0	*	But their are laws in place in some U.S. states that make getting footage or whistleblowing on the conditions of livestock a crime.  
t1_dtzx4gj	0	*	If you're eating meat, *you're paying for this to happen*. You're complicit. Your platitudes are meaningless.
t1_dtzlz7h	1	*	People who make these films are usually employed for a period. If I employed someone to work in my home and they showed me to be horrible then it's my tough luck. 
t1_dtzq1bf	0	*	SPOILER ALERT: He won't, and he also will still continue on with his hypocritical arrogance about meat eaters.
t1_dtzrd12	0	*	...you DO realise calves are given cow milk when they're growing? 
t1_du1c6ec	1	*	Not the same at all.
t1_dtzw0pw	1	*	Thats the point of the /r/latestagecapitalism mentality. Predatory capitalism is spread all over the world, and it was arguably fashioned by the USA.
t1_dtzpmob	0	*	To Mars, though?
t1_dtzz32e	0	*	Buddy if people were sent to a black site there wouldn't be any evidence of that. Hence 'blacksite.'   I'm pretty sure they were asking for source on it being called terrorism. 
t1_dtzpqrh	1	*	They will tell you that the government is so big an affects so much that they need lobbyist to tell them how legislation will affect businesses on the outer reaches. 
t1_dtzn98o	0	*	What do you mean? 
t1_dtziqrc	1	*	Yeah, its a carcinogen in the same league as Very hot beverages and High temperature frying
t1_dtzxb0j	1	*	No, more likely is that we would maintain a small population of them for historical reasons. Probably in sanctuaries.
t1_dtzvtuh	1	*	Hey how can you tell when someone's a vegan?  They act like one 
t1_dtzx272	1	*	Omg 2 downvote edits? That's a new one for me. I regret that I have but one downvote to give. 
t1_dtzxqj4	0	*	Are you trying to make a point or are you just thinking really hard?
t1_du0sdcj	0	*	Only by a year. I guess the world needs some pessimists. Otherwise us optimists would go off the rails...
t1_dtzpomq	1	*	Indeed! :( Thats a good point 
t1_dtzrk5m	0	*	Mentioning a salad doesn't mean his/her view of vegetarian dishes is limited to a salad. Using that logic, the only meat dish they'd know of is a steak...
t1_dtzl1f4	1	*	Problem is that it's all behind closed doors. Those positives you describe are all possible in a public setting. That's the whole point of a democracy right?
t1_dtzrdcp	0	*	No, you said **I** couldnt, and while some will stop most wont.
t1_dtznxue	0	*	Is it ok to kill the cashier if he's unfriendly?
t1_du00az8	0	*	Or... I could go to the local grocery store, and buy all kinds of plant based foods whenever I want...
t1_du0ljz8	0	*	Entertainment? Really? We'll never understand each other so let's just stop here. 
t1_dtzrvcu	0	*	Yeah, because your post I replied to was certainly judgement free.
t1_dtzuxf3	0	*	All animals deserve the happy ending of having their throat ripped out by a mountain lion or some shit instead.
t1_duchtec	0	*	Thats just way too simple of a way to look at it.  If you can't get any further than well it's alive then you'll probably never understand.
t1_dtzwd08	0	*	I am the best and smartest vegan I took a test. I have the best fruits and veggies believe me.
t1_du04zbi	0	*	But a lot of the morally reprehensible things i mentioned *are* cultural. If my religion demanded human sacrifice would that mean I should still be able to do that because its a cultural thing?
t1_dtzm7a5	0	*	fuck off, vegan. 
t1_dtzmcas	0	*	Yes I think it's enourmusly silly accepting a huge amount of unnecessary suffering , for almost no gain, and not go all the way, hence my rape example, in that world rape should probably be legal tbh
t1_dtzwz9s	0	*	So? They still suffer
t1_du08zey	1	*	Oh god, one of those arguments. Morality is relative and nothing matters right?
t1_dtzxylg	0	*	I watched the whole thing and I think its equally as harrowing as the OP article.
t1_du0pts8	1	*	As long as there is a demand for meat, this will continue.
t1_dtzrczr	0	*	True, plants rot too.   But meat takes much longer to digest, the animal flesh sits in your gut rotting much much longer than any plant will. 
t1_dtzk56z	1	*	Yet we cling to this one for some reason. Hmmmmm
t1_dtzhbv0	0	*	If my 70 kgs of weight aren't enough to kill a tiny cockroach first try you bet your ass you do.
t1_dtzkybf	0	*	Our teeth did not evolve to cut meat. Human dont have carnassials
t1_dtzz67q	1	*	And a high percentage of ordinary folk like you or me. Here I am thinking of cases such as Snowden. 
t1_du14uca	1	*	I know I'll get there sooner or later. Right now, I'll settle for later and just keep letting you dig this hole. 
t1_dtzm96l	0	*	Are you sure? I mean it sounds like you know what you are talking about. I have just read that a lot of chicken breeds that are really big have been breed that way not because of meds or anything
t1_dtzlott	1	*	It's easy individually. I am not contesting that. But it's not a solution that is easy to realise considering you'd have to convince the population.
t1_dtzxyap	0	*	Just Iowan animal facilities? And what do you possess it if you stream it without downloading?
t1_du0a7fe	0	*	Weve been eating meat since we were a species, and thousands of years before then. A bitter harder than a culture change imo.
t1_dtzkkrv	0	*	Yes, I am aware of what product labeling is. That doesnt change the fact that, based on the original reply, that mark could simply be a sticker. 
t1_du3m9iz	0	*	I would only kill an animal to eat, not for pleasure. I think cannibalism crosses a completely different line so humans are not in the picture here at all.  
t1_du0exfs	1	*	All at enormous and unsustainable expense and suffering because some people are driven to own a billion dollars
t1_dtzkob0	0	*	Let me go back to feeling bitter over at /r/LateStageCapitalism
t1_du0qzav	1	*	He actually had none
t1_dtzvsxj	1	*	Eating meat, not animal farming
t1_dtztpym	0	*	Why can you impose your morality on others?

t1_dtzwtqp	0	*	How so? 
t1_dtzx2rf	0	*	Appreciate for the discussion, have a good day.
t1_du01wcc	1	*	I love coming across people like you. Initially I get a delightful reminder of how pathetic people can be, then I realize you are just trolling for attention. Which is even more pathetic! Life is fun.
t1_dtzuobp	1	*	Lmao
t1_dtzmpb1	0	*	The firebombing and B/E were different people... even in your link it says that...
t1_dtzp3nb	1	*	Doesn't coconut milk have a ton of saturated fat? I am always a little weirded out by the taste, it's almost *too* rich. I prefer dairy milk over it IMO. Soy > dairy by far in my experience though
t1_dtzt7nm	1	*	Im d fending ethically raised cows. I dont support factory raised
t1_du00xh5	1	*	All my outdoor shits are free range, thankuverymuch.
t1_dtzkbai	0	*	Yes because those are the only other types of teeth we have.     Not saying our teeth is why we eat meat. It is just an indicator that humans did not evolve from herbivores.     
t1_dtzpbrr	1	*	Isn't it a subjective choice to value human life more that other life? 'Cause I'm pretty sure it is
t1_dtzkm6y	1	*	They're super eaters? can/will eat anything? Pigs of steal? it wasn't really the point of what i was saying rather an attempt at a funny anecdote.....   Edit: oops, wrong comment!
t1_dtzmouc	0	*	But come on, no realistic farming is going to involve an animal living a life of joy until it dies of old age
t1_du0jpnr	1	*	I was traveling and wanted to try the local food.
t1_dtzpss9	0	*	I guess it depends on what you see as the ethical problem. Is it animals being raised in inhumane conditions. Or is it simply the fact that we raise animals for food?
t1_dtzt67d	0	*	Im sure the cows would disagree and would prefer to exist. 
t1_du02xgm	0	*	That's a fair criticism of his word choice, but still, given the context of the discussion I feel it's an unnecessary deflection.
t1_dtzx8a8	0	*	I love that you are asking questions though! That is the key. 
t1_dtzl1ol	1	*	You just come off as a young sheltered kid. You want a utopia in a world where evil is real and will always be real. Have fun day dreaming though. I remember being 14
t1_dtzx0sp	0	*	Its a staple food. 
t1_dtzk75b	0	*	Yes because everywhere on earth is just like your environment where everyone can just walk into a market full of food.    Oh wait that is not the case at all. 
t1_dtzowoh	0	*	Then their happiness would be a null. If you want to look at it from a happiness perspective, a well-kept cow increases net happiness no matter how long it's alive.

t1_dtzxlso	0	*	That is not the same??? You are not infringting on anyone's atonomy by doing that nor killing anyone??? For pleasure
t1_du00554	1	*	For someone who brags about being strong, you do seem butthurt over getting downvoted.

t1_dtznjdp	1	*	I didn't say eating meat is the only reason most people die from heart disease and cancer,  but to think it doesn't play a factor, when the United Nations admits it, is ignorant.

t1_dtn0dvk	0	*	I'm not denying that point at all, as that is completely and totally irrelevant to the conversation we are having.  If you think it's relevant and key, explain how - in detail

t1_dtae44t	1	*	Then you would argue that Trump was not Elected by the American people at all.
t1_dt92ul4	1	*	No, but if someone with no award claimed that they were as qualified as you, they would be lying (as were you when you said you're as qualified as a Buzzfeed journalist).

t1_dudakfv	1	*	You found one bad writer and so that disqualified the whole publication?
t1_ducp2b3	0	*	GOP and DNC do not have American interests at heart, their interests lie with the wealthy elite that fund and lobby them. 
t1_ducu5fy	0	*	Yeah, I'm with you there, [Drudge Report is not great.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/drudge-report/)
t1_ducqgxt	1	*	My bad.  I was saying that 'lying by omission' was -possible-. That it is a thing that can be done. This was not received well. 
t1_ducn3or	1	*	>and extreme right is someone who literally wants to start up the gas chambers again.  For god's sake listen to yourself man.
t1_ducsf57	0	*	Why didn't it happen immediately? He blatantly ignored the sanctions and there were no reprocussions. That's why I'm negative that anything will happen to him.
t1_dud12d6	0	*	The comments have already started accusing other nations, so why get so defensive about a certain country? This is hilarious.
t1_duconjf	0	*	There it is! There's the Fox is the bad guy and CNN is gospel. Knew you'd spill it eventually.
t1_ducve4k	1	*	You could have bought the account earlier.
t1_ducus42	0	*	You're opinions of some shouldn't represent the entire country. What if everyone judged ALL Americans based on Donald Trumps actions? We would be bombed to obliteration.
t1_ducpqbx	1	*	This isn't the thread for a discussion about Israel but please feel free to start a new one and cite your sources for your accusations. I'd enjoy reading it.
t1_ducp0c4	0	*	I don't see how Russian propaganda is different than GOP/DNC propaganda. Is domestic propaganda inherently better than foreign propaganda?
t1_dud3dc2	1	*	*Twists mustache malevolently*
t1_ducxlp2	0	*	Which is why we have to keep tweaking to make things better.   Which is why we have to fight back and find ways to improve our democracy. 
t1_ducl8lq	1	*	I too can downvote and ignore what others are saying.
t1_ducslhe	1	*	Sometimes reality has a liberal bias. Sorry.
t1_duct79u	0	*	What? French-Canadians aren't reason enough for you?
t1_ducvuge	1	*	I was mostly joking, but there's a money limit in other law differences like petty theft vs grand theft so it stands to reason the amount affects the charge
t1_ducqxcr	1	*	oh, that makes more sense now.   thanks for clarifying!
t1_ducv4rx	1	*	Man you ain't lyin.
t1_ducvc2p	1	*	That doesn't mean anything. You think this all started last year? 
t1_duczcls	0	*	And you can say the same about damn near every news source?  The reason Fox News doesn't get posted is because their political leanings differ from most /r/politics posters. That's the only reason.
t1_ducssi8	0	*	> revised policies for social media sites, increased power to our security agencies  You can't just say these things without understanding how it is done and what the consequences are.
t1_dud5v5l	0	*	If you think members of the EU aren't actively fucking with each other behind the scenes, you're sorely mistaken.

t1_ducr85n	0	*	first, answer my question. then I reply to your question.  in any case bots=/=trolls
t1_ducr532	0	*	And a particular group of Russians =/= the Russians at large.   My point is every powerful country participates in online propaganda.

t1_ducwu84	1	*	lol no. That's not how that works. There's a reason it's called the Executive Branch. 
t1_dudde6l	0	*	as a reminder to readers, Jill Stein was photographed at a dinner next to Putin. 
t1_ducw1yn	0	*	True, my comment wasn't exactly a good response to yours, apologies. I got a bit riled up and probably didn't pay enough attention reading your comment. Apologies, you are 100% right
t1_dud2vlj	1	*	No other nation has the capability or moral turpitude of spamming people on Social Media. Truly the dark arts of Facebook Smart Ads and Astroturfing are impossible for any other nation to ken. 
t1_dud0pzd	1	*	I see a difference but I also don't think the difference is in propogating fake news.  Our current president was a big pusher of the fake birther conspiracy
t1_dud7loh	0	*	What bullshit are you referring to?
t1_dud12i6	0	*	xbfPor quxe9 no los dos?  ;)
t1_ducsile	0	*	Trump obviously ignores sanctions he signed and nothing happened to him. That's part of the reason I feel he is untouchable.
t1_ds2bqia	1	*	The Palestinians were offered their own country in 1947,for the first time ever. They rejected it and declared war on Israel. They lost. Losing wars you start has consequences. 
t1_dt0ihpx	0	*	The Libyan civil war had already begun before NATO got involved, thats not very stable...
t1_dt0inu3	1	*	What the hell are you talking about. I didn't defend them.

t1_dt0srbw	0	*	I believe this is ultimately why Saudi Arabia has so much control. It's not about dominating the market, it's about being significant enough in the market to have an impact on global oil prices. 
t1_dt0ot9t	0	*	More like since the fall of the Ottoman Empire, when the British and French deliberately divided up the land in such a way as to force tension. It was more or less fine before that.
t1_dt0me17	1	*	Clearly pillars of stability, they were. 
t1_dt0rrq4	0	*	It's US foreign policy to drain foreign oil reserves first, It's better for the American economy to have oil shocks now, than shortages later.
t1_dt0j3rv	1	*	Hmm still relatively short term. I mean when are the oil ressources supposed to be used up? 40 years?
t1_dt1c144	1	*	As it's a global market, this is how I understand it to be true, basically. You can't have those variables change in one place without impacting the other.
t1_dt18jxk	0	*	Really, a 12 year old can walk into a Walmart and buy a gun? I was not aware of this.
t1_dt0gl0z	0	*	This might sound like a joke but it's actual not that far of. Only very few people I know are allowed to own guns but all of them own multiple
t1_dt0k5rw	1	*	OMG so iPhones are Taiwanese haha
t1_dt0jwas	0	*	Well, there's a conspiracy theory that believes that Yemen government agents were masquerading as the rebels to try and bring the US into the war instead of just sitting on the sidelines
t1_dt0rcpx	0	*	 A militia will not win, no matter their size.  
t1_dt0yjz4	0	*	Closer to 60%. Our exports amount to about half our imports - we import, refine, and export, resulting in the US being a net (by value) exporter of oil.
t1_dt0sn29	1	*	Do you know anything at all about the Young Turks? Who they were were and what they did? 
t1_dt0isbo	1	*	Who do you think is arming the houthis?

t1_dt0j5n9	0	*	Assad was killing his people way before any involvement by the US. Same in Libya.
t1_dt17mja	1	*	World's too small now to leave any place alone 
t1_dt0pw9y	1	*	this is correct, at least in the case of European countries 
t1_dt0tu3o	0	*	Would it make a difference which ones we pander to?  Also, why would Iran automatically want to ally with the West?
t1_dt0sdfk	1	*	Since ww1 when everyone realized armies run on oil now
t1_dt0niwt	1	*	The royals in Saudi Arabia certainly arent. The Wahhabist are 
t1_dt0jm9s	1	*	I think thats where they learned that fomenting populist uprisings isnt always good policy. Heck, even Egypt was having trouble until the second, unreported coup post-Arab Spring.
t1_dt0kapi	0	*	So thats why they are expensive, low supply 
t1_dt0mqvb	1	*	Not all, just a massive swath of the really big ones.
t1_dt1zjnh	1	*	You don't need empathy to not do crimes. Or to not hurt other people. I simply want to live my own life and ignore everyone else who I have nothing to do with.
t1_dt12hb5	0	*	Where the hell are you getting 5 to 10 percent of GDP?
t1_dt0xbva	1	*	In what universe was Syria, the country with the youth bulge, big unemployment problems and apocalyptic drought, stable?
t1_dt0knjt	1	*	The US makes a lot of it itself these days, not sure Europe could buy from that. 
t1_dt1w31z	0	*	Fair enough but technicalities aside I think it would be misleading to label us as an arms exporter. 
t1_dt0o7tx	1	*	You should read the book The war on ressources. People always say it is the oil. It barely is.
t1_dt189hc	0	*	Im not signing up to live there. You go right ahead but Ill stick with the those people are fucking nuts group and stay where Im at. 
t1_dt0zm2t	1	*	Dont forget the LA (los Angeles not Louisiana) oil. Theres tons pumped from California every year. 
t1_dt0z247	1	*	What do you is going to happen to the middle East when no one needs their oil?
t1_dt2zqzq	0	*	and?
t1_dsrytuv	0	*	TIL the French Revolution and birth of modern democracy was terrorism.  
t1_dsa84or	1	*	And kool aid drinker #2 joins the fray.  Great that you're downplaying it as just wrongdoing though. Really not dishonest of you whatsoever.
t1_dur0gwk	1	*	Fries are good, also on autobahns usually coffe on gas stations is crap, mcd coffe is good compared to things that shell, omv, statoil, orlen... Sell. 
t1_dtijsc1	0	*	If they threaten and attack civilians in attempts to further their own political agenda, then yes! Yes they are!  Now you're getting it!  
t1_dtiw6h4	0	*	Don't forget that the US dropped more bombs on Cambodia (who they weren't even at war with) than they dropped on Germany in WW2.
t1_dtjd26t	1	*	Lol just go away, it's pretty obvious you have no fucking idea on what you are talking about. Good try though bud. 
t1_dtivjnx	0	*	Yeah, can I get an inert rocket? No HE, I just want to see where my HE would go.
t1_dtj1sah	1	*	3edgy5me
t1_dtiuldh	0	*	My point was you explaining it to me was a little redundant.
t1_duy6b72	0	*	You were a devout Troskyist for many years but you missed the part where the Russian communists proclaimed that private ownership of land shall be abolished forever?
t1_duraxml	0	*	Then I interpret the 2nd amendment as only having the right to bare arms when you're also associated with a well regulated militia. Something that the vast majority of gun owners are not a part of.
t1_dur51wa	0	*	You mean deliberately misinterpreting it?
t1_durx00e	0	*	Soros paid for a lot of liberal troll bots.
t1_durmtea	0	*	i'm a children in my mother's eyes

t1_dus4xwf	1	*	I don't even reply to people without reading about 10 pages of their post history anymore.
t1_dur9md2	0	*	Cars have a purpose. Their purpose is to get someone from point A to point B. Guns don't have any other purpose outside of recreation and murdering(for the vast majority of the population).
t1_dur79nj	0	*	Everyone knows you can only trust Breitbart and Fox News. And Facebook posts shared by my alcoholic uncle. 
t1_durraq7	0	*	Then you probably have the money for an iPhone if you wanted. Yeah, not the latest and greatest, but you could get a used 5s for pretty cheap. 
t1_durq5i5	0	*	again sorry for the use of the word 'all'.   My hypothesis: Alcohol is the largest contributor to general violence
t1_dur526h	0	*	>I dont believe guns should be taken away.  Then don't be dropping the DNC talking points on the issue.
t1_durw316	0	*	Oh go masturbate somewhere else... no-one wants to see that.
t1_dsbvs0g	0	*	I don't give a fuck about shorts. The church says it is disrespectful - just take their word for it inside it.
t1_dscfdtf	0	*	Pee is more sterile than tit milk
t1_dsc7ujg	1	*	Chinese tourists dont give a fuck if they are scolded. 
t1_dsbt6rs	1	*	Well to be fair the first time you see breasts it can be a little overwhelming.
t1_dscwmq1	1	*	And the mass is symbolically a marriage... so using the parable in this way would be sound.
t1_dsdo42w	1	*	Mexico belongs in the west! Join us superior north American Brothers! Together we can defeat Europe!
t1_dse6oib	1	*	Yep, in some cases even countries like Japan (Which is like the Definition of Eastern country) is considered to be a Western country in the twisted logic of geo-politics.
t1_dsbtykl	1	*	I told them I was edgy you moron. They'll figure out the Jesus thing later. 
t1_dscxc7t	0	*	No, it sounds like the church has you well under control.

t1_dsd56uk	0	*	Okay.  I'll whip out my dick and you can just look away.  See how that works.
t1_dsc7kqw	1	*	> Holy fuck this website is so full of garbage.  Exactly
t1_dsd56e7	1	*	Hilarious!
t1_ds21clu	0	*	And based on that statement, you are effectively admitting that to the best of your knowledge that just the opposite effect could be true, correct?
t1_dt0jrce	0	*	>Russia took Georgia  That's what you wrote. Don't act surprised now if you think people get confused by you stating that one country (Russia) literally occupied a whole other country (Georgia). 
t1_dut7k4w	0	*	Yeah, that's called going to your doctor, not having your fucking secret service provide it to you. You still don't understand state sponsored do you? 
t1_dsvw5pv	1	*	/r/weekendgunnit
t1_dsvb816	0	*	yes, without US backing its unlikely Europe would go to war over Russian expansion into former soviet territory, I would likely agree. it really depends how far they push it though
t1_dsvnp17	0	*	No shit, they're a gun rights group. Having people who violate the laws of gun ownership associated with them would tank them
t1_dsvzb5n	0	*	But mah GRIPZONExaexa9
t1_dsw4ayp	0	*	The order of which something is written in the constitution has nothing to do with its importance; and snatch meaning to take.
t1_dsxm4si	0	*	> Okay, then let's put the same restrictions on voting. Call it even.  Felons can't vote. Mental health patients can't own guns.  Sounds about even to me. 
t1_dsxdjqf	1	*	There are already background checks when you buy a firearm from FFL dealer.
t1_dsvb1l3	0	*	The war on drugs is completely pointless. The point of gun control is to keep thousands of murders from happening in your country
t1_dswll8t	0	*	I refuse to give even an inch, and no one is harmed by this. If you want to make laws, make some that law breakers will follow. 
t1_dt7joqn	0	*	I just mean show me the legitimately and also completely verified quotes of him being racist. I don't think there's much there. 
t1_dsvb0cp	1	*	Nothing to do with not being able to buy handguns? Not being allowed to transport loaded weapons? 
t1_dsvqndk	0	*	The problem with your statement is easily shown by asking the question, What do you think are reasonable laws?
t1_dswma6t	0	*	Regardless, it's illegal to own a gun if you use illegal drugs, which he clearly did considering the THC in his system and the facebook videos of him smoking a blunt in the car.
t1_dswnztd	1	*	Thanks for proving my point! Now dance at your midterms, puppet, dance!
t1_dsx5asu	0	*	Absolutely no one is being harmed by any gun I own. 
t1_dsxqbyb	0	*	Blah blah blah..your afraid....blah blah blah..your NRA...blah blah blah your superior etc etc...you just can't STFU can you?
t1_dsvr9zh	0	*	Whether you like it or not, thats how the gun laws work. Theyre incredibly partisan-split.  Edit: oh shit, sorry. I read it as I dont like to *think* that - my bad
t1_dsvc1rt	1	*	What's the point of any law?
t1_dsw66mb	0	*	Guns have become a religion. You'll never get a rational argument about gun safety like you might with automobile safety.
t1_dsvayjb	0	*	Holy fuck, check out the breathrough this guy just made! Let's abandon all laws, since criminals just break them!
t1_dsvbfpl	0	*	Great point: If you cook the books by adding undeveloped nations to the statistics, it almost makes you look like you aren't a total fucking idiot. Almost.
t1_dsrjiyn	0	*	I understand your point and whilst it may seem extreme it would be perfectly legitimate control measure for an IT business. Data is the new gold you know!
t1_du8sm0y	0	*	Then you don't deserve citizenship from whatever nation you are from. If you aren't there when your nation needs you, your nation shouldn't be there when you need it.
t1_du9ev4j	0	*	So you would keep running forever? Come on, no one is that much of a coward.
t1_du8a7vb	1	*	The name thing usually doesn't happen anymore from what I can tell, and citizenship takes about 8 years, meaning that it's more than just one 5 year contract you need to do for citizenship. 
t1_duo7w4p	1	*	Agreed. 
t1_ds7kwju	1	*	Sorry, seems like you don't actually have any knowledge of the Qing dynasty. 
t1_ds7ir8x	1	*	You actually think Brexit was a 'representative' of what the British people wanted? 
t1_dv02er0	0	*	And.... he's saying that it's not direct, if it went through Mohammed and then onto paper.  And if man is fallible, so are the writings of man.

t1_dt2cdi8	1	*	Regular currency usually has guns and something like the IRS behind it.
t1_dt26bjj	0	*	Everything youre saying applies to batteries too. Except batteries have 1/10th of energy storage per weight.
t1_dt2b07w	0	*	What's it backed by then? Or am I misunderstanding your point?
t1_dt1l63m	0	*	Good thing I'm not talking about electric cars then
t1_dt2ym8h	0	*	Well if someone could make a perfume that smells like burnt diesel that would be great.  I work at a logistics department and my job is to direct trucks to different ports. Best job ever. Guess why?

t1_dtopley	0	*	Well, whatever it is.. all I know is I wouldn't want to know you since you're the kind of person who talks bad behind people's backs.  People, take note.
t1_dtotir4	0	*	Suicide isn't that hard if you actually want to die, but most suicidal people don't want to, they just don't see or have any other option and they feel like suicide is the only choice.
t1_dtq5q21	0	*	It absolutely would not.    Russia, very obviously, does not mind a war on their border. Russia does not care if a war will start a refugee stream.
t1_dumc7zp	0	*	That people are upset about the implication of racism rather than the Word usage 
t1_dunaht3	1	*	And then what do you think the next armed militia will bring? It will just be escalation when there are no authority sanctioned repercussions available.

t1_dsl3wsx	1	*	It's been said repeatedly in the thread for this article and elsewhere as well. It's a very low bar to cross.

t1_dsjw2un	0	*	IIRC JFK's ancestors were largely Irish, on his maternal and paternal side. 
t1_dsjqgl9	0	*	Things like reducing crime in inner city. How does that hurt black people? Unless you are liberal and think blacks can't stop committing crimes. Use your logic to get out of that.
t1_dsjwyrc	0	*	Ask most people here if Haiti is a shithole and they'd probably say yes. People here don't exactly care about political correctness.  
t1_dskmmcv	0	*	But you're believing people who said it didn't happen without any evidence. So how are you better?

t1_dsjtddo	1	*	Who am I blaming for anything?  I live a great life, with a degree you can't attain because you'd fail out of the classes, and make more money than you. 
t1_dsjwu11	0	*	I'm sorry, I didn't realize asking someone to back up their claims with evidence was out of the ordinary. 
t1_dsk0ogc	0	*	Right?  You'd think if you're going to go around calling someone a racist you would actually have proof of them being racist.
t1_dsjuoek	1	*	Tell Barry Svrluga I love him on the Tony Kornheiser show. 
t1_dskmfyh	1	*	I'm not the president of the united states
t1_dsjyodc	0	*	Im not far right, I was just pointing out that hes right in characterizing these countries as shitholes. 
t1_dsjyjhl	1	*	Posting a link to something someone once told you would help prove your argument doesn't make you look smart and its not a valid objection to his point.
t1_dsk136q	0	*	Do Californian votes count less?  The plurality of voters did not want him to be president.  And the majority of voters disapprove of him.  Those are just facts.
t1_dsk9ojq	1	*	Didn't say fat tho, I'm not about stereotypes. I wouldn't deprecate the country that I literally want to live in. 
t1_dsjvfyk	0	*	Jesus, theres a lot of triggered Trump fanboys on reddit tonight. You guys getting longer hours in Moscow?
t1_dsjx39g	1	*	Rust Cohle? 
t1_dsk5bc7	1	*	Not really. Read my reply. OP is not even close to correct here.
t1_dsjzam2	1	*	Surprise buttsecks
t1_dsjxtu9	0	*	eh... Social is still too scary. Try something else. Friendly Democracy maybe? haha
t1_dskypga	0	*	Yes, the 35 countries from Developed areas that agreed to give the data out. It specif icy excluded the shitholes lol. 
t1_dsk0yru	0	*	Hehe, my favorite when they assume I like main stream media 
t1_dsknkvc	1	*	Which industry outside of management offers 4-5 weeks of paid vacation in the U.S on an annual basis? I was under the impression two weeks was the standard. 
t1_dskusi6	1	*	If he had said why do we want people from these black countries here? Would we be arguing that these countries are majority black? You are completely, and purposely, missing the point. 
t1_dsk9ihb	0	*	Can confirm, born in 96 and from Fort Lauderdale. That's gay or thats fucking gay was used for pretty much everything.
t1_dsjoib5	1	*	Yeah, there's certainly an unwillingness in some circles to ignore perfectly legitimate concerns about immigration. Polarizing is definitely the word. My pleasure :)
t1_dskd1kx	1	*	cant you just give up? its clear you have no idea and probably dont even know where norway is, not to mention you never read any data on the subject. you are just making a fool out of yourself 
t1_dsjxvw5	0	*	Sigh. If you don't get it now, I'm not sure you ever will.
t1_dsk975j	0	*	Good job in making it perfectly clear to the Internet that you have not and most probably will never have intercourse of a sexual nature. Unless unconsensual...
t1_dsjw3m2	1	*	Great! Good for you. 
t1_dsjwgbj	1	*	In hindsight this is probably true.
t1_dsk6us3	0	*	No, they vehemently denied it. 
t1_dsl6ql2	1	*	Truth
t1_dsjy61c	1	*	Regretfully there's no brown water emoji
t1_dsjwpgv	1	*	Oh, so your justification is actually  Obama's thoughts were just as bad, he was just more cautious.
t1_dsk2wvw	0	*	You masterbate with penny loafer polish.
t1_dsjwnib	0	*	Lol, what?  The White House has literally acknowledged this.
t1_dsk5ltf	1	*	Its petco park, you can tell by the building that is down the left field line 
t1_dsk3jby	0	*	8 years. 
t1_dsjwg2x	0	*	That's an unfounded assumption and not a justification for this kind of behavior
t1_dsk4v4y	1	*	Yeah just the fact that you want to get rid of all immigration restrictions really means you dont know jack shit. 
t1_dsjw0a0	1	*	Lol
t1_dsjyhjr	0	*	this country is so fucked up when greedy capitalists are trusted more than elected officials
t1_dsk68bd	0	*	well i don't rape or kill people, so yes.
t1_dsk5kyt	0	*	Regardless of whether you're taking the morally correct position on this issue, you are a sad, hateful person. You are exactly what you hate in trump.
t1_dskmk0i	0	*	Sure, never said I believe everything that is written.  This appears to be coming from multiple sources and I have no reason to think that they would make this up given Trump's past statements.
t1_dsjzorb	0	*	It's so meaningless. Why waste time on something so unimportant? 
t1_dsk5zf7	1	*	What we have now is both mass and illegal. 
t1_dsqoz5t	0	*	Of course not.  But odds of the average native German being one was statistically significant enough for many people to be wary of them.
t1_dsjxadp	1	*	That made me laugh. 
t1_dsjv2kb	1	*	Werent the Omega Moochos the big girl sorority in the American theatre classic Revenge of the Nerds?
t1_dsk6v78	1	*	Thank you!
t1_dtw1npe	0	*	That's an anomaly, or maybe they published the stats before the end of 2015, and we can also look at Sweden, but you didn't want that, as that doesn't prove your theory. 
t1_durt9aj	0	*	Not allowing government subsidizing Planned Parenthood does not eleminate access to abortion.
t1_durtvch	1	*	It's not the pectopah's concern what you do with the food as long as you pay for it.
t1_dury99i	0	*	How can I choose to drive a car if I cant afford one? Why dont we subsidize the purchase of a vehicle?  Edit: This is a straw-man fallacy. Didnt mean to use one.
t1_du3yogs	0	*	If you start with the premise that it's not a holy war, then it's really not a big leap to call someone who keeps talking about religion on both sides that.   Reexamine your premise. 
t1_dswsqpr	1	*	Best NY Post headline ever: [Headless Body In Topless Bar](https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/111301frontpage.jpg)
t1_dts16wv	1	*	Not even imaginative use of copypasta.  
t1_dtt4dqn	0	*	So is there unemployment benefit or are they supported by their parents?
t1_dts7hdr	0	*	Well they are putting the interests of foreigners above the interests of the US so IDK how you want to call it?
t1_dtd1ivg	0	*	Hah you invoked Trump to win a dispute.
t1_dsg6y3g	0	*	You will never have conclusive proof without a camera in the room.  Their testimony and his general sleazebag attitude convinces me.
t1_dtxwqr5	0	*	Nope, that'd be due to political pressure from the US to extradite him by any means including false charges.
t1_dtvvwdm	1	*	>Jesus you're reading comprehension is terrible.
t1_dtvr4xc	0	*	You are personally insulting me.  Seems like you're personally invested in shaming Julian.  Do you know what the word semantics means or are you deliberately obtuse
t1_dv1uxhx	0	*	America is like 95% immigrants lol
t1_dw9vrvn	1	*	Updoot you fine human. As humans we need to think about OUR future on this planet. Our time is running out.

t1_du8pg6u	1	*	lol you're right.  My brain just parsed over the grammar errors when I first read it.
t1_du7s4x3	0	*	Ah yes I remember when I was 14 and thought nihilism made me an intellectual too
t1_dt65dit	0	*	Yes, I know really well his mechanisms on people so yes i  hate almost everything about it. But hopefully Babylon will fall
t1_dtzhtrt	1	*	I felt that way up there.
t1_duhgzzn	0	*	Hmm allegation of rape against a politician mysteriously dropped  Where have I heard that  in the last year  If its good enough for Trump it's good enough for Shorten  /#believeher  
t1_dt9kmq1	0	*	Egypt had enough armed warplanes to destroy Israel in 67. Firepower doesnt mean much when your intelligence knows exactly what and where it is, you just have to beat them to the punch.
t1_dt9whg5	1	*	He's going to go down in history as one of the greatest leaders to ever exist and I'm sure that bothers you
t1_dt9gn24	1	*	Easy now, Americans are easily offensive. You cant just strut fiction like that around there.
t1_dt92uaw	0	*	Ah, the old Assad gases his own people trope. If only that were true or made any sense at all.
t1_dt96dez	1	*	Kushner is literally best buds with the King, the King accepted Jeruselum as the Isreali capitol.
t1_dt9dbfe	1	*	Why are we still fighting the Taliban? Organizations and goals evolve. But you're aware of this I presume and being rhetorical. 
t1_dt92ref	0	*	Even most of his enemies would not describe him that way.
t1_duems76	1	*	I would think so as well, stands to reason...
t1_dt7bquo	1	*	 Sorry. Skipped a word when reading the first time.
t1_dszo39r	0	*	Probably because he's an asshole. 
t1_dt5pym7	0	*	Oh yeah? Then explain the difference between Dark Magican girl and Toon Dark Magician girl. If anime fell under the definition of cartoon then why aren't they both called Toon Dark Magician Girl?
t1_dt5rr1l	0	*	What I said:  >Its really amazing to me to imagine Chinese suddenly wanting blond haired blue eyed kids if they want their children to succeed.   So you have no comment to that at all?   
t1_dtgk3u6	1	*	What was meant by this?
t1_dt64t8q	0	*	What I don't get is people who are not outraged?  Are they sociopaths?  Do they not care about their fellow man?  Do they lack a moral core?  
t1_dt62fcp	1	*	You just popped my optimism bubble there.  Can't we just get our free frogurt without the cursed doll?  Why do they always come as a package?
t1_dt5p9jy	1	*	That's even less relevant considering the comment he's replying too is talking about Manga/Manhua.
t1_dt5qvpt	1	*	cartoon and anime would technically fall under animation
t1_dt73ot3	1	*	Im in Australia now  but have lived in the UK and South Korea.  
t1_dt5rxgc	1	*	~~Who are the just and~~ why would they want white penis skin?
t1_dtvgwzp	0	*	Wow, I never would have guessed you'd put your reply in bold. Lame. Your comment is no more important than any other. You're not calling out anything. 
t1_dtvqyfl	0	*	You are wrong: D you clearly implied its rampant. Wow talk about verbal gymnastics. 
t1_dtwpu86	0	*	Enjoy having a small mind. I'm anti mutilation, but proper circumcision has its benefits.  Instead of projecting, maybe do research before shitposting
t1_dtwg8zc	0	*	lol it was done at birth in a hospital. Not by some jackass in a van.         **Ladies of reddit:** which do you prefer? Cut or uncut

t1_dtvolrx	0	*	Plus, those African studies are questionable themselves.
t1_dtvir8p	0	*	> hey, maybe please don't cut my **baby's** dick in half   what did you think was going to be the answer to that question?  
t1_dtvvul8	1	*	So don't jack dudes off... give head. I kind of see where you are coming from; since I don't care for the taste of semen, I don't swollow.
t1_dtx2p16	1	*	Not a problem for me friend. I think you missed the joke. 
t1_dtvlx55	1	*	I'm not saying they're not linked. In fact I literally said they are intertwined.  All I said was it's not solely religious. And I stand by that statement.
t1_dtwd3j9	0	*	I happily confess that I have a bias against people who perform arbitrary amputations on infants to make them appear more fuck-able.   You got me.  
t1_dtyakkl	0	*	continuing to not realize how seethrough your (admittedly light in comparison) anti semitism is
t1_dtyanlp	0	*	ps. everyone has a lobby group. few are bitched about as disproportionately and in reference to thinly veiled bigotry as those pertaining jews
t1_dtvr7r9	0	*	In Africa it is more normal to be circumcised at a later age, so there can be a comparison for the same individual pre- and post-circumcision.
t1_dtwlkv9	0	*	Just because you don't like to hear it, doesn't change what it is.
t1_dtvo3w0	1	*	Evidence? Lols so now according to reddit fmj done by some obscure group makes it endemic in Pakistan.  Like i said it suits the narrative of bigoted individuals. 
t1_dtw3ovm	0	*	Yes, but that doesn't give them carte blanche to do anything to their children that they might wish.
t1_ducw7qi	0	*	Always a good idea to double-check.  Let me know if you find that the indictment posted on RT differs from one posted on the DoJ website.
t1_dt94ytr	0	*	An advocate or supporter of fundamental Islam does not mean violent extremist like ISIS, as you said
t1_dtqfub9	1	*	You don't seem to understand. ERROR 1011. I don't know how to simplify it for you. 
t1_dtqdots	0	*	Uh, yeah he did. The left on this website are turning Pro-NK because the regime despises President Trump  Learn to read.

t1_dtqikxl	1	*	Not even the same person, guy.
t1_dtqlsj4	1	*	Dont bother. Reddit is a huge liberal circle jerk.
t1_dtqq73s	0	*	I bet he didn't look at your link.
t1_dtql3vw	1	*	Funny, It was the same way with Obama and Puttin... the right worshiped Puttin and still does to this day.
t1_dtr3wq9	1	*	Can you really compare the two in an intellectually honest way?
t1_ds7c3z3	1	*	I would like to apologize for being such a douche bag. You didn't deserve the personal attack. 
t1_dtjqmgl	0	*	Well if you own every property then people have to lease from you and at your price.
t1_dthkhkh	0	*	People are trying to, but bear in mind most policymakers are 40+ with several properties to their name - so they drag their heels on any reform intentionally.
t1_ds5wn5r	0	*	There are plenty of pornographic tv channels in America
t1_ds6a5ci	0	*	WHAT A JOY TO BE A HUMAN ON REDDIT
t1_ds69a71	0	*	We need free speech protection so we can say controversial things, not so we can discuss the weather.
t1_ds5vdqd	0	*	> Has it protected many political dissidents?  Yes, literally all of them. 
t1_ds71xbb	1	*	...reporters who *tell the truth*.
t1_ds64mlw	0	*	I see your barrel roll and raise you a penalty kick
t1_ds5x5ej	1	*	No matter what either side is, fact or fake, the state shouldnt be allowed to make the decision for you. 
t1_ds5z4az	1	*	NZ has hate speech laws... i know it's profitable to can 'murica on reddit, but America doesn't have topics/words that are criminalised like kiwiland does. Nice try tho. 
t1_ds76aju	1	*	I'm not news, but in my opinion, Obummer is far closer to being a Muslim than Christian because he eats Dijon Mustard and wears TAN SUITS THE MOTHERFUCKER!!!!
t1_ds62bx8	0	*	It's because issuing accusations of anti-Americanism is one of the most American things you can do, fellow patriot! 
t1_ds5twjx	0	*	And now we're reaping what we sowed.
t1_ds5jv9k	0	*	How do you know that warning signs of corruption and oppression aren't showing now already? 
t1_ds5x2zj	1	*	Anonymity of sources and whatnot. Not everyone with relevant information wants the public limelight. Bit of a side issue though.

t1_ds6jk8m	0	*	so no example? 
t1_ds5yzjh	0	*	Well to be fair, their constitution is the oldest one. It's only natural that the beta test isn't the best version. 
t1_ds5toip	1	*	Like holy shit this is I read headlines on reddit and just barf that shit out.  
t1_ds691cm	0	*	Yes, because any of those things has anything whatsoever to do with the US's Second Ammendment and Constitution in general.  Christ, your willful ignorant to prove your anti-US narrative is rich!  
t1_ds6ropf	1	*	Wut lol. My claim was about the nature of being and reality?
t1_ds61yri	0	*	sounds like a bullshit anecdote. Do you have any actual source?
t1_ds6jil5	1	*	Exactly. Radio spectrum is by necessity usage regulated. Run a wire and you can do whatever you want. 
t1_ds80i9g	1	*	Americans arent forgiving or relaxed on corporations. We are skeptical of both.
t1_ds6nyys	1	*	I dont get your point. You can always find people who believe any stupid thing in the world. Some people tell me the earth is flat.
t1_ds69hgn	1	*	80% of people in general consider themselves above average, so yes.
t1_ds69ule	0	*	le evil corporations
t1_ds69plh	1	*	They are treated differently than other citizens in a court of law, they only have to say they were afraid. Normal people are geld to highe standards.
t1_ds5v0as	1	*	Maybe start by proving your previous statements? And then prove this will not happen with nn repealed. The burden of proof is on you here
t1_ds6c7t4	0	*	Im not trying to actually argue anything lol. Im just trying to define what freedom of speech is and why private companies arent bound to the same rules as government.
t1_ds6jf8b	1	*	No. Internet bandwidth can be expanded by simply adding more connections. You can't do that with spectrum. 
t1_ds6gxgk	0	*	Can you please clarify?
t1_ds5v5wn	0	*	Damnit! Why can't we have a failsafe clause like that!?!
t1_ds61efg	1	*	That's what the function is for, but I don't know how to set up the timer. Two years ought to be enough time to see this played out one way or the other.
t1_ds616dd	0	*	You would rather have a state run news than the free market.
t1_ds60wfa	1	*	 I'm mobile and didn't see the tab and I looked for it. 
t1_ds5zj08	0	*	You're not going to google US media consolidation while you complain when I provide you a source that you're not willing to look at?
t1_ds6s4cx	0	*	Yes America is the only country on earth with abuses of power and corruption. How sheltered are you? 
t1_ds62vy3	0	*	Constitutions are imperfect attempts to govern imperfect men. I tend to think ours is the best of those imperfect attempts. 
t1_ds5tsjo	0	*	I just don't see the point of having one without the other against oppression.
t1_ds5kmc9	0	*	I didn't see that tab either. Even looked for it.
t1_ds602ay	0	*	How can you have political freedom without freedom of speech?
t1_ds6rd1p	1	*	Fair point. It is true that Donald Trump can influence peace and violence. I maintain my point, however, that it is ultimately out of his control.
t1_ds69jof	0	*	This.   I mean, it borders on fascism.  Pledge of allegiance for every child, day in day out, like, really?
t1_ds6jmgt	0	*	Yes, and thats not at all what Im talking about. 
t1_dt0agsq	0	*	Well 9/11 didn't happen in jerusalem, did it?

t1_dt0cgrb	0	*	Have you ever left the US for an extended period of time? 
t1_dujt2fm	0	*	Do you think they're more organized than a huge state system that tries to educate everyone and not just a few rich kids? Think about how many campuses exist in a state university system.
t1_dt7k4h3	1	*	Yeh that's the sort of thing I was imagining. Thanks for the picture.
t1_due4e15	0	*	> Shame you people haven't the brains to work things out for yourselves.  Again with the douchebaggery.   You should probably stop while you're behind, friend. 
t1_due6ja1	1	*	No but you don't have to be a condescending prick whilst giving your answer.
t1_dv2hyro	0	*	That would be the most ignorant reason to not have 51 states.  Wait until we can get 55 states lol it sounds better to say than 51

t1_dtyi1hz	1	*	Yes.
t1_dtyajlk	1	*	Especially since he was wearing a digital watch
t1_dty2oga	0	*	Thats your opinion. You must not live in a northern state. The day begins late in the winter and the sun goes down at 4:15pm  Cutting an hour off of the morning just so it can get dark faster
t1_dty2z63	0	*	Please [tell Google](http://archive.is/5iZDH) to add a UTC time zone to their mobile phone operating system.
t1_dtxzt9r	0	*	What are we looking for?
t1_dty4t3q	1	*	Yup, that sums it up well.  I love the long summer nights, with sunset after 9pm for a whole month down here in SW Washington.  The ugly tradeoff is the short winter days though.  
t1_du03h9n	1	*	Good. Glad we are on the same page after all. I guess i didnt read it the way you intended. Soz bud
t1_dtxx3k6	0	*	Unix time is more reliable anyways
t1_dty0pm0	1	*	Hey, those were the years I lost. Give them back!
t1_dtyb3um	0	*	If the law does not explicitly specify the timezone, you can always just timecode in UTC, rely on a sane OS to know about leap seconds and relax.
t1_dtxxmxk	0	*	Inception means starting point or establishment. You mean recurrence.
t1_dtxw5eu	0	*	He was confused the whole time on both trips.

t1_dty54ea	1	*	How are they related? I'm drawing a blank.
t1_dty275i	0	*	Yeah but like most things, we've outgrown the usefulness of that. 
t1_dty7709	1	*	I can't even tell if it's day or night outside from my desk here.   Daylight is worthless to me while I'm in a fully lit building for 9 hours.   
t1_dty9qsb	1	*	And they believe that the sun->clock relationship during DST is better than the sun->clock relation during the rest of the year, because it makes a better lineup for sun->life.
t1_dty26gr	0	*	What's scary about getting an hour more of sleep one night a year, and an hour less another night?
t1_dty06mm	0	*	He made an obvious joke, so y'all are whooshing.

t1_dty0bd8	0	*	Why not move the time back 30 minutes and keep it there?
t1_dty4bvf	0	*	Hey, so, I really like you, and I was wondering if you'd like to go see *I Tonya* with me next Friday, at 312.5 hours from now? :)
t1_dty2jsa	1	*	You can probably find a ton of stuff about it by just googling y2k but a good place to start is the Wikipedia article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2000_problem

t1_dty14mv	0	*	Hey, just because he was a Native American chief doesn't make him wise, that's just the stereotype.
t1_dty25n6	1	*	There's DST in many parts of the world. And if you make computations you may have to handle the cases of areas which *had* DST in the past.
t1_dtyno1m	0	*	Its weird that 9-5 is considered the norm. Every professional job Ive had (including internships) ran 7:30-4.
t1_dtxxzsu	1	*	Didn't mean to be. Just calling it what I call it.
t1_dty3n2f	1	*	I understand that a poll on a website is not a valid sample though, so confidence levels and intervals are irrelevant.  You must have moved to Alberta from Saskatchewan.

t1_dt2ckox	0	*	I suspect that your neighbors must strongly agree.
t1_dt16jty	0	*	Oh  I concede.  To be fair, all you did was criticize me with insults and then actually fail to specifically explain your position
t1_dt1ixxv	0	*	Yeah I doubt that too, there are many groups but they're a minority. Thousands, sure, but I doubt it gets to the hundreds of thousands, that'd be a shitshow.

t1_dtia378	0	*	Yes it is clearly a conflict of interest if trump allowed him in. No proof he did though. No proof he even met with trump. Tbh, highly unlikely trump personally met with him

t1_dur7tvz	0	*	Because they haven't lost any military personnel to US forces?
t1_duru4bj	1	*	I never said we should declare war, I merely pointed out that we should respond in kind in order to be taken seriously. If we show Russia we are too afraid to strike back then MAD doesn't work
t1_duqwh53	1	*	It's all a game.   Russia just bleeding bodies like USA during vietnam.  
t1_dur25xm	0	*	Hell, I was all for leaving him in place personally. From up here in Canada that whole war looked like Bush trying to get reelected and shovel some money to his buddies at the same time.
t1_duyajoo	1	*	You don't know if Saddam would have stopped there. Operation Desert Shield was all about protecting the Saudi-Iraq border. If the US wasn't there for that, who knows where Saddam would have stopped?

t1_dtmcnyn	0	*	Not true. Ashkenazi Jews are proven to be, on average, smarter than any other ethnic group. Along with that comes being more competitive.
t1_dtnnbr5	1	*	No, because you need to look at the dictionary. Majority means >50%. Period.
t1_dtljxdn	0	*	Sure it was. Nothing says friendship like trying to subjugate entire tribes, right? You're delirious man, but at least you're entertaining

t1_dtmg7fq	0	*	I have, and they did. What specifically are you even referring too? Sources?
t1_dtlp4gl	1	*	You're misunderstanding him, as well as statistics.  The rate is calculated the same way no matter which country, so it doesn't matter.

t1_dt2qqmp	1	*	Curious why not amalgamate the DEA with the FBI
t1_dt3u36m	0	*	Speaking of qualifications, the dea still thinks Marijuana does not have any medicinal value. Would you say that is analogous to hiring a middle school drop out to teach physics at MIT?
t1_dt1zdzh	0	*	i agree with that.  the comment that was loled at did not say trump would do it but that it would happen in the time frame of his term

t1_dtw7a3l	1	*	Generalisations do portray the way people are, otherwise it wouldn't be called a generalisation.
t1_dtxicdd	1	*	He didn't say they had anything to do with Christianity. He compared them to cultural Christians, i.e. are they in a similar role within the religion that cultural Christians are?
t1_du6wl0d	1	*	Yes, just like Trump won elections in US - unfortunately, hatred and bigotry have taken over the minds of people everywhere.
t1_dtw4k6v	0	*	You consider a right-winger shooting up a Mosque to be a native defending himself? I think this conversation has run its course.

t1_dtybv0b	0	*	My question was why call american Indians natives In America. Since they are not originally from there. This has nothing to do with the term Indian or India In my question. 
t1_dtw3udf	0	*	Well isn't he a MP? an official of the government? It may not reflect the ideology of the entire administration, but it is still a member of the government saying that
t1_dtxicfs	1	*	sure the hell, peace after war.
t1_dtx89ws	0	*	Yeah, that wouldn't really be possible. The Soviets wouldn't allow it, in a united India.
t1_dud5724	1	*	Yeah, and you wonder why people have negative attitude towards TD posters. 
t1_dudcqny	0	*	go expand this comment chain and start it from the top and you'll get it
t1_dud65yg	0	*	People said Trump getting elected couldn't happen either.  Member dat'? U0001f602 Soyboy? Gonna have to remember that. Mostly because my grandpa sand uncles are soybean farmers. 
t1_dud4l9b	0	*	>You don't see what helping Ted Cruz would do to take votes away from Trump and cause division among Republicans?  Why does that same thinking not apply to the Republicans?  
t1_dudfn13	0	*	Jesus christ no. Why the fuck would I do that? Go back to whatever pool of slime temporarily congealed into your mind.
t1_dud4bgz	0	*	I think you are missing the point.  The Russians were not doing this to get those guys in there, but were doing it to create dissent int the populace.
t1_due15wn	0	*	And there were no facts behind no collusion too.
t1_duda7q3	0	*	It is not embarrassing.  Its sad actually.
t1_dud53di	0	*	We?  What did you learn from this cupcake?
t1_dud4vg5	0	*	sounds like its working. 
t1_duddh4y	1	*	Paying for propoganda doesn't change the fact that the votes were made and Trump won legitimately. It's a bit misleading to call this election illegitimate if no votes were tampered with
t1_duda8g7	1	*	Thank you
t1_dud9emc	1	*	I would like holodomor of these puns 
t1_dudezud	1	*	You jumped a conclusion too far, then.

t1_due7rs3	0	*	If you are an American citizen then Trump is your president. Stop being a child just because an election didnt go your way
t1_dud608b	0	*	We have not had a cyber pearl harbor yet. Something like that would be the remote detonation of the majority of American nuclear bombs, or the total distruction of our power grid.
t1_dudmk9l	0	*	And those sanctions were lifted?

t1_dud6beq	0	*	Sure! Come the fuck at us bro
t1_dudllbd	0	*	Yes - to whatever degree you think would be most beneficial to Norway. So, what would you like to see Norway do to punish the u.s. in away that would cause Norway more benefit than loss.
t1_dud6zgi	0	*	All this Cyber **WAR** talk is making me think some Russian women and children are gonna get drone striked in the near future and the lemmings will cheer them on
t1_dud5jer	0	*	Close enough for me
t1_dudcgd5	0	*	So that's a no then.
t1_dudau4t	0	*	Surely you do not think these Russians are the sole reason for that?
t1_dud4e8s	0	*	What were the sanctions passed in the summer and who were they on, and who were the sanctions trump refused to impose actually on?  Can you please answer those questions?
t1_dud765l	1	*	Very good, I understand now.  I agree to this premise to some degree.

t1_dud4vzn	0	*	I will ask this: you can't think of some reasons why Trump would be interested in doing this other than to benefit Russia?
t1_dudj4bm	0	*	Nice. Extrapolating from one datapoint is always a solid move. 
t1_dud4u41	0	*	>posts answers in /r/AskTrumpSupporters 
t1_dud4zfd	0	*	That isn't really relevant to the discussion at hand.  That's a completely different topic.
t1_dudau9t	0	*	No, it's in the report that Rosenstein said that. That's an opinion.
t1_dud4p5x	0	*	Sure. But many people didn't even go out to vote because of the census.
t1_dudkz64	0	*	But it makes them more sympathetic to him. Especially the not-insignificant portion of his voters who disliked him but preferred him to Hillary.
t1_ducznc0	0	*	Going after 13 people specifically for subverting an entire countries election by essentially trolling seems like a pretty big witch hunt. 
t1_dud88at	1	*	Ho-lee fucking shit. That's scary! 
t1_dufpe5w	1	*	Cool. Also save some time to read the full Mueller report when that comes out with EVERYONE implicated. That one will truly be historical!
t1_dudawoz	0	*	No one believes you.  Tagged as Russian.
t1_dud8jbg	1	*	I think you need to brush up on your timeline a bit, when something is said can be just as important as what is said.
t1_dudaqwi	1	*	Im proud of you.  You may have been late, but you did your research. You've been promoted to real news.
t1_ducvxeh	1	*	Sure! The bet is on. If they're guilty I hope they're indicted but I have my doubts 
t1_dud1v59	0	*	> a~~r~~y
t1_dudbu6l	1	*	Masha Gessens new book covers Dugin, among others and the creation of his theories. Well worth the read.  
t1_dud6i1c	1	*	I know you didn't say fuck trump, but this whole thread and other parts of social media are.   I would also point out that Trump isn't investigating this stuff, Mueller is. 
t1_dud9j3k	0	*	Talks about drinking koolaid, [is literally spewing bullshit propaganda](https://www.google.com/amp/www.newsweek.com/remember-irs-scandal-it-was-fake-news-all-along-681674%3famp=1)
t1_dud6456	0	*	Young account. Has literally only posted in defense of the Donald, has a username that sounds patriotic and American. Yeah checks out.

t1_duda85q	0	*	Who is doubling the debt?
t1_due1yln	0	*	 I did. Its in the indictment. You dont want to read it but still want to have an opinion about it. 
t1_dudebdp	1	*	Yes.
t1_dud8l13	1	*	And also because the group in power have directly benefited from it, they have little incentive to fix it too. 
t1_dudirq6	0	*	Unless, that is, Putin has something hanging over Donnie's head...
t1_dud94uf	1	*	This will never be answered by red hats because their backwards reality won't allow it.
t1_dud6r7v	1	*	The US is finally getting its own medicine thrown back at them. As an American, it sucks but it is very much needed. Time will tell if we as citizens rise to the occasion or just fall. 
t1_dud383d	0	*	I think you think too highly of these people. They literally left emails talking about what they did. 
t1_dud5w5d	0	*	I think you mean seceded friend :)
t1_ducyh38	1	*	The FBI tends to have a bias against criminals generally tho man
t1_ducylhr	1	*	I think Bush stole his first election too. There are a number of reasons the Russians decided to blackmail the GOP. They have alot of skeletons in their closet.
t1_ducwrlq	1	*	Don't bother with him, he's pretty much full-time on r/worldnews trying to defend Trump's corrupt electoral team.
t1_dud9o2y	0	*	Absolutely money laundering is the real issue. Personally I do not think Trump knew about what was going on around him. Everyone around him kept him in the dark and conspired with Russia. 
t1_dudaifj	0	*	You're really discounting your position when you literally accuse anyone who disagrees with you as Russian...
t1_dudozmm	0	*	Nice username. Wonder what youll change it to when he doesnt find collusion
t1_dud76hm	0	*	nothing referring to the comparison with a traffic violation to the scenario you just mentioned 
t1_dud0jv7	1	*	 I'll admit to being duped.   
t1_dud6bsk	1	*	If they could, they would. Unfortunately it's in most of their best interests not to. It is not in our best interest to not pursue those responsible in this case. 
t1_duds03j	1	*	Yeah, the whitelist is sometimes shitty now, but anyone who was around back then knows why a whitelist is needed. 
t1_dudq2q9	0	*	But my team won!  The Chavismo also won in Venezuela. Look at all the winning. What a manchild. What must be the pain of those unable to grow the fuck up. 
t1_due3h5k	1	*	interesting. I just find it extremely wrong because the officials get a huge say in who the candidate is. 
t1_dudclxx	1	*	Agreed
t1_dueapyb	0	*	I didn't realize you had security clearance and access to the underlying information held by the U.S. intelligence community.
t1_dui918j	1	*	No problem! More Perfect is next on my list so I'm glad to hear that it's a good podcast
t1_duklvfk	0	*	Stop deflecting Hillary's failure with this McCarthy bullshit. The DNC had their guy but they chose to lose to a game show host man child instead. The Russkies paid me to say that lol.
t1_dudfbt0	0	*	You should quote the bits where Russia must *dismantle* China or other such silly, downright batshit proposals.   Why cherrypick?
t1_dud8vzz	0	*	Anytime someone makes unironic helicopter jokes I want to claw my own eyes out.
t1_dud8tcf	0	*	You couldn't be more obvious if you tried.

t1_dszoxc3	0	*	I am willing to bet my last passport had more stamps in it than yours. Go ahead and assume I havent traveled, and continue to miss the point.
t1_dtb5lo8	1	*	This reminds me of a lot of folks unironically saying that if Jews had been able to exercise Second Amendment rights that the Holocaust would've never happened.
t1_dtbsna1	0	*	And people like the person who posted this article propagated it and he has multiple defenders in here. Funny how that works.
t1_du9i6n4	1	*	That's not proof. Please try again.
t1_du9odh8	1	*	The law that was passed was following to it's complete extent. Can you cite one sentence of it that was broken? 
t1_duank81	1	*	That's entirely dependent on what you mean by left wingers.
t1_dua4lml	0	*	Liking is the wrong word. Putin just thinks it is preferable to have less experienced people in the white house. Especially when the are openly anti-NATO.
t1_du9t3rp	0	*	I feel like i've just witnessed someone having a stroke while typing on a keyboard. You ok, dude?
t1_du9mv0d	0	*	Seek help before it's too late.

t1_du9i76b	0	*	So you can't provide proof based on the grounds of comment history? Hmmmm looks like your avoiding 
t1_duad7v9	1	*	Lol.....support? maybe not, defend? Ignore? In droves 
t1_dua47bi	0	*	I'm asking you a simple relavant question while you blabber on about bullshit. How about answer my question instead of dodging it? It's better if you dont say anything at all if you cant back it up.
t1_dua04v4	1	*	Oh, yeah. But there haven't been any nuclear attacks against nuclear powers, either.
t1_duakblt	0	*	... you are aware he killed hundreds of his own people right and his removal was a NATO led effort...
t1_dubiovj	0	*	SO a multi billionaire  is risking a supposed death penalty in high treason to not be president so he can get a news network that would most likely fail. hahaha these conspiracies are funny  
t1_dua4os0	0	*	Are you just going to keep accusing everyone of working for Wikileaks or are you going to back the bs you're spouting?

t1_du9mofj	0	*	Lol do I need to add the /s?
t1_dsyyee3	0	*	You're right. You're way smarter than me and I am too stupid to understand the concept of the hypocrisy of employing double agents in other countries while hoping there are none in your country.
t1_dt47ij5	1	*	This is a republic, that republic is decided Democratically.

t1_duurree	0	*	Why?  If theyre both unwelcome, why do the differences matter?
t1_duuqxka	1	*	Its not helpful to lump all bad things together in an amorphous blob. Understanding and categorizing problems is the first step to solving them. Ignorance isnt a solution.

t1_dshl0xt	0	*	Blast! This is why I hate sinking!
t1_dshossn	1	*	what would be called a submarine carrying sub-boats ?
t1_dshriic	1	*	That is true, I was just thinking of the technical difficulty and energy expenditure of getting out to space is higher then it would take to reach those kind of depths.
t1_dshdh1k	0	*	maybe NK doesn't report anything ? 
t1_dshac7e	1	*	Not to mention that many underwater mountains are still being charted. See USS San Francisco. 
t1_dsiea5u	1	*	Isn't it something like, if a vessel lists under a hard turn its a boat, if it doesn't its a ship? 
t1_dshe9pe	0	*	But... But SEALS and their RHIBs (Rigid Hull Inflatable Boat).  Also, submarines probably carry lifeboats.  You can't explain that.  (I know, tradition...)
t1_dtg8y01	1	*	Yeah 350 million people use as much energy as 1.2 billion people(20% of the world's population vs 5%). But at least my hummer 7 has WiFi in it so I can reddit while I sit in traffic for 3 hours.

t1_dt8uvtc	0	*	Did you suggest that at work? Especially the part where you would be more productive. ;)
t1_dt4plck	0	*	Probably because law? They wouldn't count as full-time employed. Also, other people besides coders would protest unfair treatment...
t1_dt57acn	1	*	And you missed my whole point.  Medical bills in the US regularly bankrupt insured people.  
t1_dt4ws3i	1	*	The real problem with automation is that the people who own the robots reap the economic benefit of them. Workers dont own the robots. Corporations do.
t1_dt47k12	1	*	Not to mention an employee can't come to work if he can't afford to care for himself
t1_dt40rvi	0	*	Please stop

t1_dst9rao	0	*	It opens up a huge avenue for abuse of power. Who, exactly, gets to define what hate speech is?
t1_dubgehj	0	*	This is demonstrably false.  You sure like defending russia, komrade.  Got a soft spot for home, do you?
t1_dt6i8bp	1	*	Oh that makes more sense. My bad take an upvote
t1_dt6pndp	0	*	And you'll notice no country's been forced to accept refugees. And, in particular, countries that were doing the fucking up overseas have not accepted them in with open arms, either. 
t1_dt6gir7	0	*	So why would you bad mouth the country you live in, when you benefit directly from the practices you hate.  Sounds. I dont know. Hippocritical? 
t1_dt62m6f	0	*	I dont have a spin, but I do know those SPD votes are going to AfD.
t1_dt6gd63	0	*	Also not true, most of China is in my home city Heidelberg clogging up all streets in the old town and buying cheap plastic imitation beer steins that also come from China.
t1_dt7s7i7	1	*	This; I've never felt more safe in any city I've been to.   Berlin was amazing and I felt more than safe walking around it day and night?

t1_dt7rtck	1	*	No, because having strong national defense doesn't require authoritarianism.
t1_dt6owi0	0	*	Every system is susceptible to volitility, you just have to wait until someone learns the right buttons to push. In the meantime, people need to eat.
t1_dt6k30z	1	*	agreed. But no one cares what happens 100 years in the future. They just care about their lives and their child's lives.

t1_dsoxgrp	0	*	This is why the people that want us to leave, mostly tory, want us to leave. Certainly the ones that want to leave for that reason will be the tory contingent.

t1_du60v5c	0	*	Why does this matter in terms of talking about courts treatment of willing and able fathers?
t1_du82ub7	0	*	Biologicaly driven imperative to mate isn't inequality. Men are objectified by women. What women gossip about is dictated by women, and therefore not related to equality.  Next!

t1_dv3fhug	0	*	My source is the same source from where the OP pulled his information from. If you click through the links to his post, you get to Cato. I didn't grab it from google.
t1_dv38hwl	1	*	Youre welcome.  
t1_dv3e6x3	0	*	Eh..I don't think I'm with you there.  Wouldn't Merrick Garland have gone through?  He didn't seem like an extreme 'partisan' judge.  
t1_dv3bae5	0	*	The leader of the group later admitted that he made it up. 
t1_dv3aanx	0	*	Lad you're the one who said  >More people voted for the guy you don't like than the guy you do.  That's just false.
t1_dv3k9xg	0	*	> your little DNC buddies  Lol what?  > getting yelled out  That's not a saying. At least not in English. Having trouble with the Russian translator, Vasiliy?
t1_dv3su4o	0	*	Wow, just wow...I had always heard about this but never saw the actual article.  Should have seen the writing on the wall.
t1_dv3bqtm	1	*	I'm generally specking about omc more and used a copy-paste because I don't want to write something new for every half-trolling dick forgetting how toxic T_D and it's circle can be.
t1_dzhoghx	1	*	He came as a refugee with no legal right to be there, yes.
t1_dv33hev	0	*	Yeah, you're on reddit. You'll see some words that have been taken in through colloquial meaning. I'm not writing a grad school thesis, irregardless of what the actual definition is.
t1_dv3y4sz	1	*	Yep, that's what I'm saying.  Don't know if it's necessarily true, again, but would make sense for sure. I liked your example, makes the idea less abstract.
t1_dv3he59	1	*	Campaign and investigations started in 2015.
t1_dv3fuvp	1	*	Reddit could be cooperating with an investigation.
t1_dv381lu	0	*	Lol, speaking of gullibility, seems like modtools is serving up some blue meat to the faithful. Have a great day!
t1_dv4vg9o	1	*	Flew over a lot of people's heads but thank you for clarifying. Yes, that's what I meant.
t1_dv3cqny	0	*	Except for his love for white supremacist groups symbol.   I love the KKK, swastikas, holocaust denial, but I'm not a white supremacist. I just hate non-whites! What's wrong with that?
t1_dv3bdw8	0	*	Depending on the cartoon that would probably be pretty funny. Sorry if your username is true but don't take it out on everyone else you come into contact with

t1_dv39sa0	0	*	Couldn't their hands be tied by the FBI or some legal injunction (right word?) though? We know their warrant canary was removed a year or so ago..
t1_dv3a1g5	1	*	JIAN YANNNNNNGG
t1_dv38bhy	0	*	It's become a stereotypical joke. It's what Russians say when they're mad, especially on the internet, especially in video game voice chat.
t1_dv3aald	0	*	You mean the definition the entire rest of the world that isn't the US goes by?
t1_dv3dhcx	1	*	Buy rigs and mine it. Then you are invisible more or less.
t1_dv38qcw	0	*	You anal? Ok but why tell everybody?
t1_dv36lwz	0	*	alright, then prove me wrong. what policies did bernie support, that trump also supported, convinced you to move to trump?
t1_dv3afzj	1	*	Dude your mind is going to be blown when you learn about inflammable
t1_dv4b07k	1	*	You really don't, since T_D bans people with dissenting opinions.
t1_dv381jm	0	*	No one knows. It hasn't been tested in court.
t1_dv3a7oh	0	*	Oh gotcha. You must've edited after I loaded the thread initially. I hate when that happens.
t1_dv3agmm	1	*	Hmm, that makes sense. It works until it doesn't.
t1_dv3en86	1	*	It's also common sense to know that you are a child rapist and serial murderer.
t1_dv38pj7	1	*	Yeah I'm banned from a lot of subs for making comments on The Donald. The fact I think they're bat shit insane on there has nothing to do with it, just an insta ban for even engaging with them. 
t1_dv33w5e	0	*	Who is saying that Russia doesn't trying to influence the US?  When have they not?
t1_dv3820g	0	*	Lol. No one is on reddit for any discussion I barely ever read any replies to anything. I only click on my mailbox to clear the messages and never read those cancerous things. 
t1_dv35xt9	1	*	Not equating, just noting that the same thing is happening elsewhere.
t1_dve3dzp	1	*	Who the hell is a paid troll?
t1_dv3wepz	0	*	You can't be a lot of fun if you never take the stick out of your ass.  Fuckn Barney
t1_dv3799h	1	*	Oh for the good old days where we called those places The Army or Bowling Leagues.

t1_dv38imo	0	*	> Canarys wore tiny little hard hats with lights on them. They walked around with a clipboard and yelled at anyone they thought was slacking off.  /u/awildsketchappeared pls
t1_dv38tdm	0	*	Ah, didn't see the sarcasm.  Don't think that should qualify for a downvote, though.
t1_dv3ffq0	1	*	Thats terrifying. To think there is people here in America that stand for what we lost millions of lives to eradicate in WW2 is terrifying
t1_dv3nm26	1	*	No... They don't give a shit about their values they just care about their Lord and savior trump. 
t1_dv3hyaf	1	*	web traffic = money   so if they feel like getting rid of it will reduce traffic more than keeping it around keeps people from visiting, who knows
t1_dv36ptj	0	*	And you think they just stopped?
t1_dv3omzq	1	*	Fat chance.
t1_dv37axp	1	*	If they even had an ounce of what it takes to see through a conspiracy, they wouldn't have became conspiracy theorists in the first place.
t1_dv3xepq	1	*	capitalism has killed 1 billion people since world war 2  the most egregious and most likely falsified estimates point to 20 million deaths in communist countries  
t1_dv3gbxf	1	*	Well yeah, they're crazy.
t1_dv37i1s	0	*	No.  No I dont.   
t1_dv3i8x7	0	*	First of all it's *jiberish*. Second you're racist because it's Russian. Lastly translating the Russian language to English is hard work!
t1_dv3bow1	1	*	And it allows continued monitoring for a case. 
t1_dv3qdby	1	*	T_D comes in all shapes and sizes my friend. It's not all alt right Nazi's... trolls though, so many trolls. and shit posting. 
t1_dv3uaub	1	*	No, because minority status is treated as a class and not majority status, but privilege status, is treated as another class. See Proletariat and Bourgeoisie.
t1_dv3ear9	0	*	.....and now I no longer like Jeff Dunham.
t1_dv3a3w0	0	*	Why yes, I will leave the information telling up to journalists and experts instead of random loony blogs and a Russian Propaganda Arm, thank you.
t1_dv36s2l	1	*	That would be so much better because we could give him some marginal task to do, while the rest of the policy wonks actually run the country. 
t1_dv39ovj	0	*	What collusion?  The primary is a nomination, not a fucking vote U0001f602  I guess it's collusion that your coworker got nominated for a position and you didnt.
t1_dv3clfc	0	*	They're just concerned about American politics! So what if the Kremlin signs their paychecks! 
t1_dv37x74	0	*	You really dont pay attention my dude. But be stubborn, Im sure itll make you feel better 
t1_dv3ise5	0	*	Archived posts of a fake Tennessee GOP twitter account that was posted on T_D, this account was ran by one of 13 Russian Indited by Robert Mueller. 
t1_dv3990e	0	*	Especially if it's set up so that continuing the canary's presence requires action. I.e., you haven't removed it, you've just sat and done nothing and haven't renewed a page that's now a lie. 
t1_dv35s0j	0	*	Stop pointing and start doing
t1_dv40y99	0	*	i thought this was about the politics sub?
t1_dv39u7h	1	*	I genuinely have a hard time believing this. Trump is the antithesis of Bernie.
t1_dv3k605	1	*	Exactly. I voted for Jill Stein because she's wasn't a complete idiot. Lol 
t1_dv3d7bo	0	*	Read my edit for clarification, and feel free to expand on or correct anything in my edit.
t1_dv3dt8z	1	*	Both.
t1_dv3mj4i	0	*	FWIW, I really like your version so much more.
t1_dv3cr6t	0	*	Yeah...you sound like a totally honest bro.  
t1_dv39gbs	1	*	Yeah Im just calling the bluff.
t1_dv3cmq3	1	*	I've been banned from both for being critical of Trump, even if true. But touche if you think T_D is bad.
t1_dv3atig	0	*	And America claims that it's a democracy lol. There were literally 2 options that had a chance. That's not democracy, that's the illusion of democracy.
t1_dv45lb6	1	*	Thanks!
t1_dv40xbt	1	*	Why would it matter to them?
t1_dv3di27	1	*	Oh, yeah. That was the one I was actually thinking about! My mistake!
t1_dv3d6zw	0	*	Read my edit for clarification, and feel free to expand on or correct anything in my edit.

t1_dv3mi2k	0	*	At this point we don't know what evidence the investigators have or will have in the future, there are no guarantees yet. 
t1_dv37us2	1	*	Experience tells me that if they frequently post on T_D, I know enough about them to know their mind set.  And it's often a tirade of hate for anything they're told to hate. 
t1_dv39udb	0	*	They wouldn't have to necessarily, they could just let it expire and charge a company for revealing they received a national security letter.
t1_dv3798h	0	*	Are antifa weak soyboys or deadly terrorists, I cant keep track of right-wing bullshit
t1_dv3p2k4	0	*	Oh, you see I learned about it through reading. I also thought that show was generally considered to be a hacky love-letter to the Clinton-era, rather than demonstrative of actual politics.
t1_dv3vxyw	1	*	Because fuck greed. That's why.
t1_dv3p65u	0	*	seriously? or jk?
t1_dv3fcbl	0	*	Could you could point to some case law or statutes? That all seems protected under the first amendment.
t1_dv3rpge	0	*	Fine then. Grandchildren with the appropriate amount of limbs.
t1_dv3b76r	1	*	Yeah, Klobuchar and Franken were easy votes for me.
t1_dv374yw	1	*	I get what you're saying. Must be frustrating

t1_dv3cb27	1	*	Ew. 
t1_dv38gma	1	*	You can tell it's a Russian troll because any true backwoods ass American alt right hillbilly would of just said, Fuck x! Or, Screw y! and no go into that great of detail about it.
t1_dv35yoz	1	*	Yes, because thats exactly what I meant. 
t1_dv39559	0	*	Many alternative possibilities have been presented in this thread. To conclude that reddit admins just don't give a fuck is one of the least likely of them.

t1_dv3ke63	1	*	Dank memes can't melt real American Steel.
t1_dv3bqd3	1	*	Well if you never let word out about a shitty thing, nobody will feel the need to change anything and there will be no pressure to make sreongef regulations and checkups
t1_dsz15r1	0	*	Why would i beef with you if this is the first time i had an argument with you on reddit? Lmao  And no youre not a doctor, too stupid to be one so stop pretending lol
t1_dswvjsc	1	*	Yeah but why does any info of wrongdoing only come out when his administration is criticized?
t1_dt68qib	0	*	Detroit is a deep blue state?  Michigan is anything but...  deep blue cities aren't a thing.  Governors aren't elected by a city.  go read a basic civics book before you make another comment.
t1_dt57kfa	0	*	System will not change without major stress and a complete breakdown of civil society. This won't happen until it's too late, and at that point either American Empire or American Ruin.
t1_dt65vno	0	*	> damn the consequences  Yeah I don't even know why I bothered asking you. Your Hollywood approach to International relations tells me all I need to know. 
t1_dt5gx8r	0	*	someone only watches Fox News
t1_dt5zgen	1	*	Being here illegally is a civil matter, not a criminal matter.  The only illegal immigrants that are criminals are the ones who have committed crimes. 
t1_dt5u5rg	0	*	It's everyone's driveway. America is there to make sure the area stays open to everyone, not just who pays China. 
t1_dt654yx	1	*	They should have just used a [real example.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overthrow_of_the_Kingdom_of_Hawaii)
t1_dt57wej	0	*	It protected citizens from themselves recently. They almost picked a candidate who wanted to start WWIII and supported multiple illegal coups worldwide.
t1_dt5x8hn	0	*	If that's true than Americans are a bunch of naive idiots. Why would anyone want to vote *for* Trump because of something Hillary did?
t1_dt64ptn	1	*	This is pretty much what everybody's been doing. We aren't being aggressive towards them. But we refuse to acknowledge their claim on these silly islands. We're essentially calling their bluff
t1_dt66swb	1	*	Just because he didn't do it in the room doesn't mean he didn't do it later to the thought of it.  I wasn't really being serious though.
t1_dt5x32c	0	*	Read the first line of the comment you are replying to, deliberately encroaches on Filipino territorial waters: it's neither the US' nor China's driveway, it's the Philippines'.
t1_dt65mbo	0	*	Please. They dont vanish. Theres a story every other month about Putin critics being gunned down in the streets. They arent even so subtle as a mysterious vanishing. 
t1_dt640e4	0	*	After what? 11 years? 
t1_dt5srxd	0	*	WOW, someone likes their self-confirmation bubble.  Did Trump and Fox News (the network that Trump directly interacts with) tell you it's all hoaxes?
t1_dtazdsx	0	*	You can build a gun in your garage too.
t1_dt61wfg	0	*	You start off with an insult? you expect me to waste my time taking you seriously? Haha
t1_dthzag2	0	*	Do you know how Bill Clinton got impeached? 
t1_dthdm9u	0	*	We can't show you why you're guilty, it's a secret. is the language of a fascist state. America should not operate that way.
t1_dsppudt	0	*	It's a terror tactic, but they know full well the rockets are ineffective. Treating them as an actual threat is disingenuous no matter who's doing it.
t1_dspkwzx	0	*	A statement from the government agency certainly is credible. Quit reaching.
t1_dspkzo6	0	*	I gave you the Health Ministries statement. What else would you like?

t1_dsqtqy4	0	*	You do realize it doesnt change the definition of a live bullet right?
t1_dt09rm2	1	*	Impossible to say for certain, but France gives us a fairly decent prediction of future events. What much of Europe has done in the last few years France did decades ago.
t1_dt09f4z	0	*	Seems like you have absolutely no idea what nazi means.
t1_dt08wzr	1	*	> you're laughing at the death of people that you don't consider of value because you're at the fore front of progress  What the hell are you even talking about? And who are you quoting?
t1_dt1yue8	0	*	Oh I doubt we'll ever get as big as an incident as you had in Las Vegas last year. 
t1_dt09089	0	*	I know you are probably a troll, but... Well, immigrants do cause a lot more crime. Logically, more immigrants would mean more crime, no?
t1_dtvc3pr	0	*	I am sorry to hear that. If you haven't, watch the TV show. It is not only in a different league, but on an entirely different plane of existence. 
t1_dtueii8	0	*	Too subtle for reddit? Let me spell it out for you: It's either propaganda or a valid source, you can't have it both ways.
t1_dtu0tpu	0	*	>non sequitur stuff about America and Trump  lol
t1_dtw3w1j	0	*	I don't think given your list of preferred cars that you're particularly worried about emissions. 
t1_dtu5duk	0	*	Yes slightly, 0.08 vs 0.06 g/km of NOx for instance.  Well, I'm all for freedom, so have fun with your hobby. Just recognize that you're not representative of the everyday German.

t1_dsnqyb0	1	*	Putting in immigration controls means less people come in   Kind of the point LOL
t1_dskga1x	0	*	Both mainstream candidates sucked.  Thank the assholes who reinforce the defacto two-party system by verbally attacking anyone who votes independent.
t1_dslqd4t	0	*	I don't think anyone's okay with being poor, just be thankful you're physically and mentally healthy enough that you could work two jobs and go to school because not everyone is so fortunate. 
t1_dsk6jh2	0	*	Criticizing one side != endorsing the other. You can say that Fox's remarks are out of line without having to support Trump.

t1_dsf8yj7	0	*	Ah. Someone didn't read the memo.
t1_dseyhb5	0	*	The Damore memo made no claims about superiority - it simply said there are biological gender differences and discussed ways to get more women into tech; it was literally pro-hiring women.
t1_dsfeotc	0	*	Well discrimination isn't exactly a smart thing to do.
t1_dsf5zjr	0	*	he said, despite multiple studies showing otherwise
t1_dsgil50	0	*	Love how you losers think sex is the only motivator that exists. What's it like?
t1_dsf572w	1	*	The problem is that the context isn't the same for everyone. We're teaching kids about things like white privileged in public schools. What context do they have? 
t1_dsf0w5s	0	*	If you want to be clear, dont be sarcastic. Choosing sarcasm and then ruining it for everyone is just a terrible decision.
t1_dsf4dzc	1	*	I thought Jewish white men should not be considered white
t1_dsf2kkl	0	*	If black is a culture because they're unable to determine thier ancestry, wouldn't white in the U.S. be a culture if they've basically given up their original ancestry in favor of American white?
t1_dsf4v9k	0	*	Probably the one discussing managers booing each other, if they don't bring the ratio of white men under them down to particular quotas.  That would be the strongest in my mind. 
t1_dsf5szg	0	*	Are you a lawyer?
t1_dsf55pw	0	*	> Who said you're not allowed?   You specifically said white is not an identity. Are you going to backtrack now?
t1_dsf0raa	0	*	The phrase is now apt and is moving into the mainstream because of policies and political environments like the one at google. 
t1_dsf4hrj	0	*	Except that the majority of people working at Google are men, so how would that claim stand up?
t1_dsf8xnu	0	*	No Not at all I am saying that maybe the Majority of Female CS Grads worth their salt choose Google so there is an inflated ratio there?
t1_dsf337e	0	*	> Where did it say they got a bonus for threatening Damore?  There was evidence of this presented in the lawsuit, as highlighted here:  https://i.imgur.com/61aluxY.png  
t1_dsf5g9c	1	*	It would indeed allow for legal action.  ...There's not even a 'but' in that statement, you can entirely sue a company for that reason.
t1_dsg4v0k	1	*	They're privately owned. 
t1_dsf0k2d	0	*	When companies discriminate against white people...the statement will get traction.
t1_dsf6j7v	0	*	Plenty of evidence shown in this point to a culture of discrimination against cis white males in the company. 
t1_dtyev8h	1	*	Meh.  I'll pass.  Rape is not something I feel the need to vicuriously experience.  Not trying to be preachy, just not my thing.
t1_dsxjlps	0	*	Try to look at a map where Russia fits in completely and find the buffer states. They take up like what, 0.001% of Russia's territory?
t1_dsxh4vg	0	*	You completely ignore that people in Crimea are scared of going against the Russian occupation and that it shows in polls.  Way to distort reality wow....

t1_dsxvhth	0	*	You've been? Tell me how awesome it is. 
t1_dsxg4ib	0	*	This paranoid and obsolete Russian thinking is really not suited into our globalized modern world. Buffer states are so last century.

t1_dtrcdja	1	*	well i have a class where my prof post messages to the class group..that's the only reason i open FB   
t1_dtrj22o	0	*	Yeah but it's not a 100% reliable and you have to constantly double-check what you say. You can't be yourself when your family members are on your friend's list.

t1_dtrok6g	0	*	> subestimate   ?
t1_dtrcri4	0	*	Me too. Yet somehow the population is growing. 
t1_dtrn4bx	1	*	Bookmarks lol. What goes there is never visited again. So I punish myself with the ugliness of a 100+ opened tabs so I can actually go through them to get rid of them
t1_dtrswie	1	*	> Why do they even consider following us on Facebook?  Because their friends do with their children and your parents are jealous.
t1_dtrjr05	1	*	That was probably it, similar experience to reading replies to Trump's tweets. It's seriously sad that there are many people whose confidence and self-esteem is based on such lifeless illusion.

t1_dtrf6q3	0	*	Wrong, forums didn't have up and downvotes and circlejerks didn't exist back then. Reddit is also a giant echo chamber, at least the bigger subs are.
t1_dtrk2ez	0	*	Doesn't work. Yes, you get posts in order, but it's still a restricted selection of posts based on what the algorithm decides you want to see.
t1_dtrikbr	1	*	Yes, but only a few of them :/
t1_dtrecjs	1	*	I had my midlife crisis at 15... If I live to 70, I'll have doubled my life expectancy. I wish I was joking
t1_dtrd9y5	0	*	If you did it has been witnessed. However if you did I will have forgotten your username by the time it gets big.
t1_dtr9bk3	0	*	Im here just to say I saw that too and yeah.... idk ?
t1_dtro6uu	0	*	Yep.  Same parents that told us dont believe everything you see on tv believe literally every single thing on Facebook.  
t1_dtrs5w4	1	*	That is fucking sad lol
t1_dtrqs8f	1	*	There's more than one way to fail. Just because you have a lot of money doesn't mean you did not fail the human race.
t1_dtrj3dm	1	*	Cause it so big and in the future 
t1_dtrvd0j	0	*	HR is there to protect the company not the employees. Its not uncommon to have HR conspire against you.
t1_dtrssra	0	*	Did you let her continue to walk all over you or did you put a stop to it?
t1_dtrd2hh	1	*	International friends 
t1_dtrdk4v	0	*	I havent but if it is related to my comment, then I think it will make me even more depressed.
t1_dtrdmfp	0	*	Do you know how many old people I've had to tell that Mr.Rogers wasn't a US Navy SEAL in Vietnam?
t1_dtrnepn	0	*	Depends on the ISP. Mine stays the same as long as my cable modem doesn't reboot. At one point I had the same IP for over a year.
t1_dtrapkk	0	*	I think Twitter is kind of the flea-market of the internet. You walk around and see all the shit at once. 
t1_dtwnjhd	1	*	Rooster Teeth made an entire episode of Camp Camp about that actually:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wclHMqytzMc  Camp Camp is like if South Park was about summer camp, and it's great
t1_dtrh51s	0	*	You can start over, but it randomizes your class and you lose access to your old save.
t1_dtrtgur	1	*	> being pro user without Google Ultron  What is this?
t1_dtrgatz	0	*	Pretty sure shitting yourself breaks the rules of almost every contest ever, or at least tends to end the contest. 
t1_dtrjhuj	0	*	Please describe predatory practices and how they hurt the consumer...
t1_dtrgyog	1	*	Now I'm just curious, but would you get ID'd if you buy bullets?

t1_dtrmmf2	1	*	Don't you?
t1_dtrez2a	1	*	Most recent stories that the algorithm decides to show you. 
t1_dtr9pms	1	*	We had computers before the internet, you know?
t1_dtrb9ho	1	*	Yeah I have never been so I haven't processed how dead the night life might be. But I always hear about it from Athletes and Musicians who tour and stop through. 
t1_dtrhu9z	0	*	I mean, he isn't wrong. Have you ever read FB comments?
t1_dtrvmxf	1	*	Get your loose butthole out of here bro, no one wants to read this here 
t1_dtrosga	0	*	Sounds like your mom knows whats up
t1_dtrfs58	1	*	Utah! ...but Im taller. 
t1_dtrifkc	1	*	Yeah YouTube feels like a radio station that only plays the same top hits over and over. Even if I switch to a totally different genre the autoplay will find its way back to that new Drake song.
t1_dtrdtxu	0	*	Judging by the context of the previous comment you can huff it to get high. I don't know whether this rules out it just being pressurised air or not.
t1_dtrlg6r	1	*	Thus the SJW has spoken. Thx for the uselees remark.
t1_dtrhqzv	0	*	I actually agree with hardly anything I see on Reddit, Facebook or Instagram. Including this comment.
t1_dtth9hs	1	*	My mom once called me to fuss at me cause she was troubled because I used the word fuck in a status. I understand.
t1_dtwp7tn	1	*	Fuck that bitch then
t1_dtro5nk	0	*	I don't do heroin, though. I just like Walmart
t1_dtrdt9a	0	*	Yes, mainly used for dusting the inside of computers or other small spaces. Also you can get high off of it if youre desperate or too young to get real drugs.
t1_dtrjln0	1	*	Advertising/Advertising?
t1_dtre8sr	1	*	Etheearthian
t1_dtsoq2f	1	*	It's weird how that suggestion could encourage people to use FB more while at the same time being against FB policy (using fake name)...
t1_dtrco6j	1	*	Right, and Wal-Mart or whatever big store would have come if not for them sucks money out of the local economy and takes jobs, making locals spin the wheel of addiction.
t1_dtrnaj5	0	*	> One of the reasons I prefer using fb in the web browser over the app  Is the second reason that the app listens on your microphone about what you're talking about so it can send you targeted ads?
t1_dtt49n7	1	*	Oh well damn, glad to hear everythings going all good! Just kinda strange seeing someone say they used to be a heroin addict like its nothing lol
t1_dtrrk1z	1	*	That is perfect. I have heard of that but not sure how to do it. It's like annoying aunts and uncles have to comment on every single post. 
t1_dtrlur0	0	*	You've never had a MiL snap at you over something completely random that was visible to all your friends.  I have and now she doesn't get to see much of what I post 
t1_dtrc5mt	1	*	reallywackytictacs was banned ~~cause admins SUUUUCK~~ cause it was proliferating violent content
t1_dtrcpdo	0	*	You're gen z technically, the oldest of that gen are 23
t1_dtrxf5w	1	*	I think youre trying to make it seem as if Im defensive but once again I was pointing out to a reason why FB is going down hill. 
t1_dtsejtc	0	*	The whole point is that the things that are actually good about facebook arent specific to it.
t1_dtrhb7z	0	*	I still use IRC to talk to me real internet friends.  Yay! :p
t1_dtrl497	0	*	No kidding.  $100 per year for someone to keep my computer organized.  I think I probably took 200 screen shots last week.
t1_dtri6jl	0	*	35-36 is nowhere near middle aged. Life may be fleeting, but not that fleeting!
t1_dtrz0ot	1	*	A true life motto 
t1_dtrk1q4	1	*	Lack of decent jobs i suppose. So in this case i think it's trying to work longer shifts at lower wages.   Plus it gives people reasons to keep using it, self-rationalization i suppose. 
t1_dtrknl9	1	*	Very informative, thank you!
t1_dtrnvkg	0	*	Pull the trigger. Deactivate that shit.
t1_dtrb86z	0	*	The fuck is a Kmart?
t1_dtrgb5n	0	*	Goddamn I would be angry if someone called for stuff like that while working Helpdesk.

t1_dtrovto	0	*	How many of those tabs are Stack Overflow?
t1_dtrlpoy	0	*	I only use bookmarks for sites I go to all the time, and even then I normally just use URL autocompletion from the first letter or two.
t1_dtslv6v	1	*	That's makes so much sense. I hadn't considered that point of view since I never used FB messenger. Thanks for the insight.
t1_dtrep1i	0	*	It seems to me that having a retail based economy to start with is its own mistake. But I'm no economist. 
t1_dtrluoi	0	*	Upgraded to 16gb years ago and now the same Kingston 8x8 set is double the price
t1_dtrmoea	1	*	> That's bonkers for a site  I think ['this comic/meme'](https://i.imgur.com/vtTVSCY.jpg) summarized the situation well. The greed for more and more profit leads almost every company to its doom.
t1_dtrlcyp	1	*	And it was a popular meme on reddit two years ago.
t1_dtrf1ei	1	*	Yes
t1_dtrg6w8	1	*	It will still show you posts from days ago if its still getting commented on. 
t1_dtrb2ss	0	*	No threads here? 
t1_dtrp679	0	*	I feel like the alternative was the silent chamber where you just didn't talk about the big 3 topics at all and let the papers and news tell you what everyone was thinking. 
t1_dtreaq2	1	*	I remember Woolworths as a destination retailer back in the 1980s in the USA.
t1_dtrdxjv	0	*	Batteries have shelf lives as do their motors. 
t1_dtrsptc	1	*	Juniper....my sides 
t1_dtrhmvb	1	*	Compared to most cities, no.  They're spread out and have weird hours.
t1_dtrl3l6	1	*	Same here. I have all my family added and I'll still post whatever I want.
t1_dtrw0hd	1	*	Walmart business practices have no relationship with what you mentioned.
t1_dtrg6g1	0	*	I...I think  so.
t1_dsjd2oo	1	*	Oh no no. If you missed a toll you can have 7 days to pay the missed toll before getting hit with a ticket.
t1_dsjbrpu	0	*	Most of the murders in St Louis are done by African Americans, unless you're calling them racist assholes.
t1_dsjboo5	1	*	I like both places. Singapore is ungodly clean, like freakishly, no strays like the rest of Asia, but you literally have to follow every law, including jaywalking, which got me all fucked up.
t1_dspobin	1	*	How does it stand when the statistics mentioned use city populations and not the metro area?
t1_duhlg4m	0	*	Not Hep C friendo. There isn't a vaccine for that.
t1_duife5g	1	*	Yeah, pretty average for most 'session beer' really, I prefer about 4% tbh, since I tend to drink around 3 pints an hour regardless of strength.
t1_dt0bspj	1	*	accidentally hitting someone with your car isn't murder though.  It's manslaughter.  Murder is when you plan to commit a homicide.  You know, like the death penalty. 
t1_dsssa9z	1	*	You *are* the one.
t1_dtnyhr6	0	*	Bill Clinton is no longer President, so there is no more raping going on in the white house.   Careful what kind of bullshit you spout in your everyday life if you have a job mr. Edgelord.
t1_dut6q6s	1	*	At least we're not going to war wow.
t1_dubcjg6	0	*	I realize that there are shills in social media. If you are going to call out the Russians, then maybe you should call out all of them. They're on both sides.
t1_dufukjg	1	*	So for sport and hobby you are willing to sacrifice children and innocent people? Like I said cold heart. Don't talk about self defense. How many times have you honestly used it for self defense?
t1_ducerxl	0	*	Because gun ownership is a right. Driving and vehicle navigation is a privilege. You don't get to vote on rights, that's why they're called rights.
t1_dubcpte	0	*	I was asking about interference in our election, you responded with an example of propaganda. Do you understand the difference?
t1_dubmq75	1	*	The whole point I go on Reddit is because I dont want to see the same shit I wanna see all the gimme. 
t1_dubqjcv	1	*	We had a war over this.  It's in the constitution.  You'd have to amend the constitution first if you want to leave the union, or, well, another war.
t1_dubef3m	0	*	Then toss out an idea and let's chat. What do you want to see passed that isn't a thing now?
t1_dubdzxx	0	*	Are you sure the Washington Post is credible?  Aren't they owned by Jeff Bezos? Doesn't have a 600 million dollar contract for the CIA?  
t1_duc1h98	0	*	Thats nice i am all for it, though that still doesnt explain why Russian bots would flood twitter for pro-gun in America. Your idea is still essentially pro-gun. 
t1_duc2hvg	1	*	Yea didn't even think about that part of it.
t1_dubnydw	0	*	Are you serious? Literally anything vaguely positive about Clinton was met with a flood of crooked, rigged, corrupt etc etc. 
t1_dubxgaj	1	*	this is why reddit can't be taken seriously
t1_dublcww	1	*	Your problems who tf are you that isn't included?
t1_dubknxl	0	*	Neat
t1_dubsunk	0	*	for sure. one wonders how many underhanded methods go undetected on all sides though.  the crazy thing is, everyone thinks they're doing the right thing
t1_duch3og	0	*	I agree with you other than the blatantly sexist last portion of your post. Gender is a social construct, there is no difference between men and women. 
t1_duboi7q	1	*	Who has posted I support giving guns to mad men here?
t1_dubmyvo	0	*	Lmao. Never heard of /r/all huh? Where 90% of the good material is?
t1_dubts9w	0	*	Ha same 
t1_dubqh9x	0	*	None of what you said is relevant to the Russian collusion narrative and how it started.
t1_dug96md	1	*	Plenty of people probably even defend Monsanto and the Koch brothers out of genuine if misguided uncompensated conviction.
t1_dubvgls	0	*	That doesn't matter. I'm talking about the Russian separatists. 
t1_ducbpxl	1	*	Says a lot about our society when people can't call the police as there's the chance the victims of a home invasion could meet a worse fate from the police than the perpetrators. 
t1_dubs28e	0	*	Oh I'm sorry I got crossed up between a comment chain about shills and one about bots. So your point is that account was posting a lot just to get that username in everyone's faces all the time?
t1_dubng5l	1	*	>Inb4 someone calls me an Alt-Right Shill  >Inb4 OMG Not all commies  >Inb4 BANNED
t1_dubol9o	1	*	This is probably a bot given the immediate troll reactions and the 4 repeated posts. 
t1_dubqzzz	0	*	They have an entire page detailing their methodology. You've also now completely changed your initial argument. Twice.
t1_dubsj23	0	*	Are you suggesting that if the US were to go to war with Russia, my neighbors would kill me in the streets because I'm a Russian troll account...?
t1_dubqco7	0	*	Immediately following the primaries, the site was 110% pro Clinton. To an unnatural level 
t1_duc6tr5	0	*	That's because you have been brainwashed.
t1_duc5ffg	0	*	Dammit, I knew I should have specifically excluded Gardasil, which oddly bridges those two topics.  I mean things like Tdap.
t1_dubqmtk	0	*	so would it be possible in any other system? or are you just trying to particularly shit on capitalism??

t1_dubialm	0	*	Please note that I said data, and not evidence. My claims are not reliant on either side being correct, only that the data is likely to exist.
t1_dubf9l5	0	*	This study is a study that looks at states which use ID laws that require *other* state or government issued ID's. There's no case study into how a voting-specific ID would affect turnout.
t1_duc2pno	0	*	By swatting away uncomfortable information you're proving their point. Well done. 
t1_dubqjy0	0	*	There is no group that calls themselves alt left. Its a made up term used by conservatives for some reason. I live in a radically liberal area, and have never met an alt left person. 
t1_dubovoj	1	*	My god, you've found the connection
t1_dubno6i	0	*	Since when did it stop??   Its even worse now.  
t1_duc684l	1	*	Ah, Keith Kloor... the man who also supports 'clean coal' and opposes FOIA requests about his communications and financial links with US corporations.
t1_dubq0pg	0	*	I largely agree but just for the sake of discussion what about lottery winners or people who inherit stuff as a child? What did the Queen do to fuck someone over to get her wealth?
t1_ducvpjl	1	*	Lol gotcha, we'll forget trying to understand eachother then and just continue to increase the right/left polarization. Works for me.. My side holds all the guns anyways.
t1_dubrh6d	1	*	That's an interesting viewpoint/idea, actually!
t1_duc30zp	1	*	Not surprised. Was this on twitter? I know Reddit still has these issues but I'm so glad I deleted twitter for that reason
t1_dubsy4y	1	*	Yesss, that one. WOw fuck 4chan
t1_dubm32p	1	*	They are waging a war of attrition on my arteries
t1_dubprc7	1	*	Wow it would have ruled to get paid a million bucks to run a twitter
t1_dublnt0	0	*	Projection much
t1_duh0fxu	0	*	Ageist as it may have been, I was suggesting that your experience is not sufficient to judge the performance of this president.  As to your evaluation, I .. have no words.
t1_dudkohc	1	*	Get some sleep, bud!
t1_dubtaob	1	*	End the drug war. That's like, 95% of your homicides each year right there. 
t1_dubocdi	1	*	We know damn well who is causing problems, those pointing fingers in the other direction are either sheep or complicit.
t1_du1p2cn	1	*	Stfu lol
t1_dsdadz4	0	*	You're a piece of work, you are. I factually refute every single thing you spew, over the course of 3 replies in one single thread, and *this shit* is the best you can do.  Go cry in your KFC.
t1_dsmpx4a	1	*	OP posted an article.
t1_dsnui9j	1	*	Ah I see so Hull full stop isn't actually the name. Got it! Thanks.  
t1_dsnla3z	0	*	Your economic predictions are hilariously out of touch with reality.  Show me an example of something akin to your predictions happening.  Ever.  I'll wait.
t1_dtkxzr2	0	*	Ah but we can regulate their access to antibiotics. If they go to the black market for it after that... At least it won't be as many people
t1_dtkxcny	0	*	You get more out of meat than just protein
t1_dtl259c	1	*	But... but... I love puppies!
t1_dtkvk3a	0	*	Doesn't really matter if they find something. So many people will still die from this ignorance.
t1_dtkyvm7	0	*	Why do you say that?
t1_dtlfclw	0	*	*shrug*   Okay. What does that have to do with American universities though? They're not taking these grads from anyone. They want to come here.
t1_dtlez8h	1	*	nanobiotics
t1_dtkvdp9	0	*	How have I done that? This is simply one thing the regional government is doing to reduce meat consumption through the law. The additional things have no relevance to the general discussion.
t1_dtl7wqt	1	*	Yeah its gonna be let people die so only the strongest survive. 
t1_dtkxjnd	0	*	We need a new emperor of earth. One who cares about antibiotic resistance.
t1_dtkz9n7	0	*	I just assumed it was an inexorable march towards resistance, and even if we stopped over-prescribing antibiotics, we'd still have all the resistant bacteria.
t1_dtl0bqm	0	*	I hope I'm not being ignorant, but I'm hoping nano machines will be able to fix our antibiotics problem?
t1_dtl3fb6	1	*	Thanks.  It's not so hard to find in the PNW.
t1_dtlizjg	0	*	That one throw away comment doubled my karama and my phone won't stop buzzing. The only person who underrated this was myself when I posted it.
t1_dtkyhvy	0	*	high cost is actually part of a solution. If antibiotics weren't so dirt-cheap - especially last-resort antibiotics - they wouldn't be used in such a widespread manner.
t1_dtkx0fp	1	*	I eat shrimp, crab and lobsters, so eating insects wouldn't be too different. Just don't expect me to eat the shell too.
t1_dtleqvo	0	*	Hey, If you act like a jackass, nothing you say will hold any water. So thats up to you haha
t1_dtlbvse	0	*	Nope. Not even close to being the same. Had you been eating quality meat, you would have known it varies even from an animal to another.
t1_dtldtd1	1	*	Aw ponies. How did you manage to make that sound cute...
t1_dtl10rg	1	*	Ha! I forget about that user name!!!! I got the user name as I was changing my life around, so, while it's descriptive, it doesn't fully describe me at this point!!!!
t1_dtkzf1k	0	*	..kinda like gee i don't know, how the majority of the US think that global warming is a myth and that they get to pollute as much as possible because....MUH FREEDOMS!
t1_dtlz6or	1	*	Every type of cancer is completely different you can't say it will be easily dealt with because it isn't one thing. Also drug resistance in cancer cells is a thing, any treatments won't work forever. 
t1_dtl1nat	0	*	Nah, just herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, insect/animal repellants, and a bunch of fertilizers!
t1_dtl0h2g	0	*	I don't think you're supposed to put glue IN a wound, just pinch it closed and put glue on top. I feel like getting it inside you is potentially toxic.
t1_dtl8hlf	0	*	Really? How many? Or is it a 1 out of 1000 case everyone parades around, which by itself implies how unique of a case that is?
t1_dtmkj5s	0	*	Ok, now name a barter economy that exists today.   They don't exist and won't exist because they make exchanging foods and services very difficult
t1_dtkza2p	0	*	You know there are a bunch of different seed companies and farmers buy new seeds every year for hybrid vigor not because they are forced to right?
t1_dtl2ied	1	*	Sadly this is a myth. Cage-free or free range chicken farms and procedures are just a marking idea.  Most farms keep them locked up in filthy condision and zero space
t1_dtko4rs	0	*	When is the last time you drank a beer that was filled with poison?  Well technically...
t1_dtlcf70	0	*	If the demand is not there, they would not need to produce it in such quantity.

t1_dtli42r	1	*	[](/zomponk)28 episodes later
t1_dtls7ru	0	*	Source?
t1_dtl26pd	1	*	We'd all have to eat a lot less chicken or give over a lot of land for chicken farms.
t1_dtl0oz4	1	*	General surgery is a specialty.
t1_dtv3ul0	0	*	lol ok whatever dude
t1_dtkvhfg	0	*	Well, it's not like the US or American universities are actively trying to take these people away from their countries. And that's how you're making it out to be.
t1_dtky8jf	0	*	Eh, whatever they make up will be very underpriced and similarly abused in India and China before long. 
t1_dtkwqqw	0	*	Parts of America have great eduction.   I started college already taking second year calculus, where as others were taking the math courses I learned first year of high school

t1_dtl2jt4	1	*	The chickens are your boss.
t1_dtlsujr	1	*	Its probably not overpriced if its saving your life.
t1_dtkvuc0	0	*	We're losing doctors and nurses in the UK to other countries. We don't pay well and are privatising the nhs. It's a whole thing.
t1_dtlb7pm	0	*	Because meat is the *only* thing capable of being fucked with in any way... /s
t1_dtlmb7f	1	*	Exactly! Chinese designs very few things. They are designed elsewhere and produced in China due to the fact they have no problem treating people like animals... Or slaves whatever is convenient
t1_dtmt3me	0	*	Lol u think Asians are a step down from white girls??
t1_dtkz430	0	*	Sorry legal and political structures don't allow for that.

t1_dtlj2fk	0	*	no u
t1_dtkzoc3	0	*	There are thousands of antibiotic drugs. Microbes don't remember that many things for that long.
t1_dtldrj8	1	*	Do you want a reboot, because that's how you get a reboot. 
t1_dtl52d0	1	*	If that was true I wouldve appreciated someone posting it because I find it highly relevant. But I guess only your opinion about whats relevant matters
t1_dtldtjc	1	*	My Little Keshik
t1_dtkyv9g	1	*	They probably already have it lol
t1_dtl2tbm	1	*	Wouldn't solve anything in the grand scheme of things
t1_dtmkn5i	0	*	P.s. barter economies still have prices. E.g. price of one cow is ten chickens
t1_dtkzpue	1	*	That would be vaccines, too bad people think it causes autism.
t1_dtlczh1	1	*	Fair enough! Happy farting! :D
t1_dtldtlj	1	*	> I just hope medical science will manage to find a solution.  They will abuse any new antibiotics.  
t1_dtl44lk	1	*	Placing my next highest hopes in genomic medicine.  :)
t1_dtkwwla	1	*	Evolution is their antiantibiotic
t1_dtlblfk	0	*	Nope. If same cells gave the same taste, a cow leg would taste the same as a rib.
t1_dtm69my	1	*	You're looking at 50 years maybe. Definitely not 10.
t1_dtl7j30	0	*	This is just an excuse the weak and lazy use to avoid solving problems
t1_dtkycx9	1	*	Regulating the distribution of them completely works actually. It's much less sociological than one may think.
t1_dtkxu3a	1	*	You know, i have yet to see a company that cares about their consumers. Companies care about money.
t1_dtl3s16	0	*	Can we not sell the antibiotics to China?
t1_dtl57et	0	*	What the fuck are you talking about? 
t1_dtkz9cq	1	*	I can't remember what it was called but wasn't there a type of fungus that was much more resilient than antibiotics? Also harder for viruses to become immune to
t1_dtkxhcz	0	*	I've encountered this in real life on many occasions as well. I just don't find people in real life showing me videos of mutilated live cows. 
t1_dtl733y	1	*	Unless it has substitute goods. In that case people will just start eating the substitute like beans, nuts and grains. It is not like someone is going to die due to lack of meat.
t1_dtkxber	0	*	Telling the truth isn't enough. If someone you know uses tanning beds all the time and you're like I hope you enjoy your skin cancer. That's not an effective way to get them to stop.
t1_dtlfhbc	1	*	Come to think of it, that might actually be the one good thing about inflated prices- if this stuff were priced too high to be economically viable to feed to chickens, you'd not see it used for such.
t1_dthmaud	0	*	I'm not painting with a broad brush when I'm talking about people I have spoken with face to face. You should read what I wrote a second time.

t1_dthomw7	0	*	Man I just couldnt get past the not doing anything because the other half of the time conservatives label him as the president that killed people with drones. Both of these things cant be true.
t1_dthj31s	0	*	Have you? The phrase literal witch hunt was used to describe a figurative one. It doesn't matter how long it's been since there was an actual literal one. That's still not a literal one.
t1_dthkc91	0	*	You just restated your statement from before. How are the bad and inappropriate but Trumps are not?.
t1_dth386c	0	*	Dont let it sound like fact, because it isnt. We can all make fun of it, and we probably should, but dont take something like that serious when theres zero evidence.

t1_dthj6ru	0	*	Did you even read the articles? No of course not.  > The Republican-led House Oversight Committee  I don't even know why I bother with evidence. Must be wild to be unable to trust facts.    
t1_dtimrg7	1	*	Well to say they are underage would mean you've asked for that or you're ignorant to it, since its hardly common place to ask your pay for sex person how old they are. just sayin'

t1_dthd6qy	0	*	You've done nothing but troll and haven't provided anything for the dumb shit you spew, so go find it yourself :)

t1_dthlz44	0	*	You'd trust the government healthcare less than a for profit company that makes bank by paying out the least amount of healthcare possible? Odd.

t1_dthib19	1	*	Huh? What are you talking about? Are you on the wrong comment thread?
t1_dthcxmd	1	*	Oh I agree. I don't respect his policies, and consider anyone who supports them to be an idiot, but they have a right to support whoever they want. 
t1_dthngq3	0	*	Your post makes absolutely no sense. Elaborate, if you'd like.
t1_dtikufp	0	*	I didn't. I wanted Bernie there. But that doesn't matter anymore, all I want now is for, if guilty, trump to be out of the white house and for us to have a real president again.

t1_dthqeo5	0	*	Totally outta sight.
t1_dthpi7z	0	*	...What?  No, I didn't say any of that. All I said was that there is rampant anti-intellectualism running through republican rhetoric. That's all. 
t1_dthtobg	0	*	Let's not forget the DNC rigged their primaries to keep out the guy the people actually wanted. Bunch of saints the democrats.
t1_dthf58o	0	*	Can you provide the full transcript? I'd like to read through it. 
t1_dth962i	0	*	They show two people within the FBI who were critical of Donald. Not law enforcement agencies tend to be left leaning. Don't go extrapolating generalities from single instances. That's your problem.
t1_dthyowv	0	*	Nope. Not the comment but the person. 
t1_dthhs44	1	*	grow a fucking backbone bro 
t1_dtha2kl	0	*	Because he didn't think they were a threat. Then evidence suggested otherwise and he switched positions.  It's not that hard.

t1_dthf2a0	1	*	That is a good one.  I do know there is a lot of doubt regarding the pee party incident.  Though, most of the evidence against it is from a Hungarian basket weaving website known as 4Chan.

t1_dthj4oj	1	*	Shit you're right, next they're going to say he golfed 2 over par instead of 1 and it'll instantly install Barron as president.
t1_dthchbt	0	*	He did recuse his duties until he was cleared and so now hes back to business. The irony in your comment about conspiracy theories in a thread on Russia-related conspiracy is just too much to handle.
t1_dthilx3	0	*	I never said DNC hired Steele.

t1_dthqxxx	1	*	Typically I'll use Google news and use the show more to see the various titles to at least give me the placebo effect of various sources.
t1_dths4o5	1	*	Those are terrible numbers. How do these numbers show theyre voting against their own interest?
t1_dthtz7b	1	*	A lot of 'educated' Americans think the earth is about 6000 years old.  I'm saying that doesn't count.  They'd have been better off majoring in dance theory. 
t1_dthjjm5	1	*	If he wanted to fire Mueller he could have just fired Mueller. It would have raised a huge fuss, but he has the power to fire him. He chose not to.
t1_dti04jc	0	*	This confused me. Only 26% of Americans voted for him. If he is losing people how can 38% now think hes doing good? 
t1_dtgywqm	0	*	They are people I went to college with and 2 of my best friends. I dont go to 4chan and I dont post on the_Donald as both groups are utterly retarded.
t1_dthgjz8	0	*	They were hacking a university. They were not targeting anything and the article twice explain this was a complete fluke. At least this is what they are saying.

t1_dthql1h	1	*	I'll keep those in mind. Thanks!
t1_dthglw1	1	*	It's so difficult as a foreigner to recognize what is the meaning of those words.  It makes you feel very unwelcome.
t1_dthmi1f	0	*	Why would someone who doesn't like what I have to say bother wasting their time with a response? You can just go fuck off to wherever, I don't care if you don't like my opinion.

t1_dth3hse	0	*	I did in another post. Sorry I should have done it again. Thats me being lazy.
t1_dth9bev	0	*	Not liking Donald Trump is not the same as being left-leaning.  His approval rating is 30%, not many people on either side like him.  Because he's an unapologetic asshole.

t1_dthey5v	1	*	> You realize it takes effect Jan 1, 2018 right?  Which means you won't see it on a return until next year. Especially if you're still doing that old dumb idea of zeroing your dependents.
t1_dthg62s	0	*	And which one turned up any wrong doing?
t1_dthm3oh	0	*	What these f*cktards dont understand is that if the deep state existed and wanted to remove trump, he would not have been elected, and if he was he would have been thrown out months ago
t1_dthhloa	0	*	Do you realize how much you sound like Alex Jones?
t1_dthemfy	0	*	I don't like what you say, so my idiot friends and I will do really stupid things that hurt us all collectively, out of spite.  Good plan, genius.

t1_dth3dr6	0	*	So now its underage prostitutes. Where did you get this info if the tapes exist and we know whats on them where are they.
t1_dthec9q	1	*	No, the piss tape is just the juiciest part for public consumption. The real compromising material is financial blackmail, like money laundering and loans with a quid-pro-quo arrangement.
t1_dthsdhv	1	*	Whoa this is a cool channel, thanks!
t1_dthif33	0	*	All right that explains a lot, thanks. Do you think an impeachment will happen if Trump is be found guilty? 
t1_dthxoob	1	*	Most of that shit would have gone through with the repubs too. Surveillance state... check Letting bankers off... check Stoking middle east tensions... our fucking national pastime.
t1_dthvasl	1	*	Thats not it at all, but you hear what you want to hear.   I make a genuine effort to respond to people, but this isnt worth it, you just want to get mad.
t1_dth9u2w	0	*	Awww, cute! I'm happy to see that you can regurgitate bullshift leftist points without critical thinking since they need people like you.
t1_dthb46a	0	*	Huh.  you guys Doesn't say Trump Supporter  Weird.  Guess you've made an ass out of yourself again.
t1_dthi8ei	1	*	I'm not the one who just got their comment removed. You have no proof that I can be classified as alt-right other than somewhat supporting Trump and joking about the left trying to impeach him.
t1_dthidf4	1	*	Whatever you say man.
t1_dthxp41	0	*	Sure we want some of the same things, but they're convinced a magic sky fairy or more corporate tax cuts will somehow achieve those ends.  They're delusional.
t1_dtlguln	1	*	Ah I see, you weren't calling people angry conspiracy kooks in a mocking, derisive sense, but rather in an endearing, affectionate way. You admire angry conspiracy nuts, I understand now.
t1_dthnjak	1	*	Ah, the Messiah. Thanks for bringing back the dead. Are you next going to elaborate on their terrorist fist bump?
t1_dthbh4m	1	*	We'll talk about that tomorrow night...
t1_dthkcrq	0	*	That's not elaboration, that's rephrasing.
t1_dthh7uz	0	*	You're not serious, are you? Brian Ross from ABC was just suspended like a month ago for reporting bullshit. I'm not a Trump guy but the MSM gets shit wrong ALL the time.
t1_dthf9ic	1	*	It's not a direct insult, but you are still correct.
t1_dthjy4j	0	*	>He was told these computer crimes were ongoingwhich he'd acknowledged on July 27 by calling for more such crimes.  Woops, that kills his whole summary.
t1_dthcn9o	0	*	Well good luck.  An Empire always comes to an end.
t1_dthi2fc	0	*	What? You're not making any logical sense.  I'm simply asking for evidence. You and nonody else can provide me any. You're getting extremely angry about it and deflecting.  You need help.

t1_dthopjs	0	*	If that's your argument, you should be against universal healthcare.
t1_dthidzl	1	*	The president has about a 1% effect on the stock market I wouldn't give him too much credit for that but I agree on taxes.
t1_dt1qv5n	0	*	It takes much less farm land to directly grow crops, than to pasture animals.  Do you have a point? 
t1_dt374vy	1	*	even minus the subsidies, its still far cheaper for them to buy grain, than to get grazing lands. 
t1_dsslen5	0	*	I mean, plenty of shoplifters acknowledge stealing is wrong so I imagine a lot of them just realize they deserved their sentence.
t1_dssdyng	0	*	Why?  I can't see how power hungry dictators are good for a nation.

t1_dst429e	1	*	Huh?Did we actually managed to build it at some point?
t1_dstgl2v	1	*	The problem with saying Those people deserve to die is you have very little answer when someone else moves that pointer at you.
t1_dsipsbe	0	*	Sure fucking thing dude. Not the prospect that the literal most prosperous country in the history of mankind will continue to prosper. Must be propaganda. Get fucking real. 
t1_dshdh8p	0	*	Your country must be terrible seeing how ashamed of it you seem to be.
t1_dsifzo0	0	*	Oh God, so fucking brave
t1_dtox1h4	0	*	It's okay to be white.
t1_dtp0yvo	1	*	Because everyone who voted for Trump was a supporter of the KKK, right? It's these stupid false equivalencies that make you just as stupid, if not more stupid, as the people you love to bash
t1_dtov6m9	1	*	Are you saying that you believe that Trump supporters and pro-Brexit folks fall in the same category as hate groups or white supremacy organizations?
t1_dv08jdb	0	*	You missed my point... What I was trying to say is there is always a nasal N in the Chinese pronounciation, so Zhogguo is how the word sounds like when you take the N sound away.
t1_duzl5j8	1	*	 o   _ u do 't get joke...
t1_dv13d9v	0	*	I dont understand the content of your comment.  Whats this about bragging?  OP said that there werent protests in China.  Every single link (and item you quoted) refutes that.

t1_dtgocq1	1	*	Lol at that.  It's also a case by case personal basis. Not an entire country because you want to be a weak president.
t1_dtgluvu	1	*	Blind allegiance, religion, and a lack of critical thinking serve a powerful purpose as motivation for voter turnout. Not a good one, but a powerful one nonetheless.

t1_dtyuky5	0	*	Yes I'm a Trump supporter, no I don't agree with everything he says and does, and the fact that you'd lump us all into the same box as one collective hivemind is very telling.
t1_dtzuue3	1	*	Well then we have that in common. I think Trump and the many Clintons are all corrupt as hell. We haven't had a true statesman since Carter. Although, Bush Sr. was a good man, I think.
t1_dtytt86	0	*	You're right. It should go on. Because there is Russian collusion. In the DNC.  https://i.imgur.com/mOfus5J.jpg It's a big picture. So you have to zoom in. 2500x2272

t1_dtsmx4z	1	*	Fair enough. 
t1_dtvz4d1	0	*	That makes a lot of sense. The stock price has climbed to record levels, and in the past 5 years has gone from roughly $37 a share to $45+ now. It was a solid investment for those bankers.
t1_dtw03ph	1	*	Plus taxes
t1_dtvw132	0	*	You just put the starting pay at $120k. That's pretty insane for starting pay.  I think you're just used to the luxury, considering most of us couldn't even choose the $60k job if we wanted.

t1_dtvwk4z	0	*	Actually the evidence suggests that young people dont move as much, which is bad as its a great way for pay rises.
t1_dtw1ktq	1	*	A lot is an understatement.   My intern break room had a lock, no windows, and a glass table.
t1_dtw1h8r	1	*	Man that'd be nice. I work 6xd711's
t1_dtw09ec	1	*	It's both, obviously.  No reason to work people only 40hrs a week if you can work 'em for 60 at the same rate.

t1_dtd34ns	1	*	rapists tend to prey on the vulnerable. that's the common denominator among the things you mentioned.

t1_du03f42	1	*	How quickly you show your true colors by calling someone who criticized your argument a butthurt queer.
t1_dtznzwg	1	*	Like in the 40s, with Americans being proud of Jessie Owens for beating the nazis in the olympics, while denying him the rights white male Americans enjoyed   Its very two faced

t1_dtzmgyi	0	*	Show me where he has been openly anti-gay while VP.
t1_dtzg898	1	*	Fair. You made a good response though. No one chooses their sexuality. I didn't choose to be straight. Indeed; choosing to be gay would be a massively illogical decision.

t1_dtzftwf	1	*	And gay people aren't happy to be literally attacked every day.  So that seems like kind of a weak justification.
t1_dtzs5v2	1	*	You know what OP meant. You're arguing against a straw man. Bye

t1_du0v1sa	1	*	Well go look at what the source links and tell me how that's not anti lgbt. Because so far you havnt even attempted to discuss anything. You just say the source doesn't count. 
t1_dtzt4w0	0	*	> are you suggesting that people that want to change their sexual behavior shouldn't have access to those seeking it?  You're debating multiple things bud.

t1_ds42k9o	1	*	That's the key. They can't make that switch without having a China to outsource production to, like we did.
t1_ds3xmly	0	*	Fair enough. You raised a good point. 
t1_ds42com	0	*	You realize India was a bigger ally to USSR than China right?   Or that China isnt communist since 1980s right.  Pretty sure not so dont comment on a topic you have no clue about 
t1_ds42edk	1	*	So what is the relevance of India being a democracy to the topic at hand?

t1_dsjs8uh	0	*	I'm saying that charitable tax credits should be removed. If you donate, do not expect a benefit from it. That's the true spirit of donations.

t1_dsew46b	0	*	Many hard-line vegans see those petting zoos as an affront, aswell.  Keeping animals caged for the sole benefit of their human overlords is not acceptable. They're essentially enslaved.

t1_dup37n7	0	*	Turks also say that they moved Armenians from one place to another. The goal was not exterminating Armenians. Ridiculous imo.
t1_duoyv7p	0	*	Except that this late in the game, they would be punishing people that had nothing to do with the genocide.
t1_dup663q	0	*	Jimmy Dore is one of the worst. The only semi decent person to come out of TYT was Dave Rubin and even that is a bit of a stretch.

t1_dup462x	0	*	And how much do they profit from blood diamonds, oil and other resources?   10 billion a year is nothing compared to how much is stolen from Africa.
t1_duozhfh	0	*	Netherland traded half a million slaves. Turks should pay back when Netherland gov. sends billions of dollars to African countries.
t1_duq3baa	0	*	So why is Turkey singled out by all these european countries? What if Turkey suddenly recognized the congo attrocity as a genocide suddenly. Pretty sure Belgium would be upset as well.

t1_dtyozqx	1	*	You have a personality disorder.
t1_dtysgmo	0	*	Well we are reusing rockets after landing them.  That's something borschtland can only dream of. 
t1_dtzjlk2	1	*	Of course not, it would be a waste of cash to do so. NASA is focused on exploring outside of LEO. 
t1_dtyez1o	1	*	Thank you.
t1_dsov5d3	0	*	I wouldnt call the 1970s the beginning of the US-Israel relationship. 
t1_dss271l	0	*	Omg I'm pretty libertarian on most things but holy shit I wish we paid teachers more.  I would absolutely support cutting every federal program by 1% to fund increasing k-12 teacher's salaries.
t1_dssmfi6	0	*	The Burghers would disagree with you.
t1_dst7v7f	1	*	> You sound like someone who is uninformed and has inflated view of China, I am sorry to say.  Irony.
t1_dss1dp9	0	*	Probably, I wasn't following politics very closely back then and don't remember.  Republicans and Democrats are both pretty bad at this tbh.  The system encourages short sighted decision making.
t1_dstipxp	1	*	Humans will be humans.
t1_dssf6eu	0	*	Why dont you read the current article at hand and tell me why China think buying US debt is not so good right now.
t1_dssl1r0	0	*	Yes, especially in Asian history, theres even phrases about merchants buying and selling countries, or replacing monarchs. 
t1_dst1v1u	1	*	Nothing new under the sun, son.
t1_dsuy41m	0	*	Where's your sources? KMT commited the most soldiers in the war, and won the decisive battles themselves. You can even argue the Soviet Union or even the British helped the KMT more than the USA
t1_dssazrt	1	*	No, the DoD is 20% of the federal budget. The federal government contracts the production of weapons to private firms, like the ones  certain conspiracists believe run the country.  
t1_dssytcu	1	*	Yes? This seems obvious, IDK. 
t1_dssb0pc	0	*	And I'm betting theres a lot of 'secret accounts' worth a few billions.
t1_dssbxgw	1	*	Not quite. They never took back North Germania, never successfully completed their conquest of Brittania, still weren't in full control of parts of Gaul, and that's just off the top of my head.
t1_dssbwit	1	*	not all military spending falls within the military budget,  nuclear weapons are part of the energy department.
t1_dssrbk3	1	*	But selling cluster bombs to Saudi Arabia is ok right 
t1_dstddq3	1	*	You got it buddy. I love this stuff. If you want a simple way to really follow it, follow the 10yr treasury and the 2yr note. It's interesting to see how they sell and trade.

t1_dtezhgx	0	*	Can you explain what you mean by that?
t1_dteuybz	0	*	First off,  turn off the email notifications. Second, who cares what others think? Identity politics are for losers. 
t1_dtfh27f	0	*	A man can have 4 wives but a woman can't have multiple husbands.  How is that not discrimination?
t1_dtfd4o4	0	*	To test our faith. Are you somehow implying that his omnipotence would logically clash with his creation of shaitan? I don't understand your implication here. 
t1_dtfetd3	0	*	No, I'm wondering why it got zero air time and zero mentions.  Seems like a really good issue to be in support of for that group. 
t1_dtf0isl	0	*	The hierarchy of the Catholic church is certainly sexist.   And I think OP was saying women priests might be nice since the vast majority of sexual crimes (and violent crimes) are committed by men. 
t1_dtf02bo	0	*	Calm your tits. I have a chin strap. I just like to try and steer people away from cults. 
t1_dtev1qz	0	*	No, zhe is saying they don't want to stand by the things they have said. By the way,  you shouldn't asume gender, it's too easy to hurt feelings. It's 2018
t1_dtf00et	0	*	Thats not what he was saying, while I dont agree with him he was saying theyre all equal in their covering up of women. 
t1_dtf6iqp	0	*	My point is that you can't overstate the barbarism of Iran's treatment of women. There is no argument to be made on the degree of mistreatment.
t1_dtha5k3	1	*	But to attribute it *to* Paul is not logical.
t1_dtf32w6	1	*	>It's like calling Al Sharpton a leading Protestant.  That is honestly a great analogy. Thank you for that.

t1_dtf777i	0	*	Today it is directed to women because they're the group that will benefit from equilibrium. Once that is no longer the case, we can talk about renaming it to equalism or something.
t1_dtf6qfw	0	*	So Mohammad wasn't a pedo? He fucked a 9 year old. Anyone with a rapist as a prophet is probably going to be called weird by me. 
t1_dtf1ye5	1	*	That women are only worth their looks and sex appeal? Is it really not obvious? 
t1_dtf1v74	0	*	Let's remove all men from positions of power, because women should rule everything because they have vaginas n shiet. Sounds like a great idea.

t1_dtfkihl	0	*	IUDs are useless according to you? Have you ever talked to a woman about them? They are *far* from useless.
t1_dtf8mvh	1	*	Lol gotcha, that makes more sense.   I strongly believe that religion should be absent from politics. God says so should *never* be a reason why we make a law.

t1_dukuh30	1	*	The reason the previous president is relevant in this case is because Trump's quote directly mentioned Obama.  Otherwise, I agree that Obama is mostly irrelevant.

t1_duk63p4	1	*	Just mentioning that if you could care less it means you care at least a little and have room to decrease how much you care. Could not care less is what you were looking for.
t1_dukg0y2	1	*	This too is bullshit, of course.  We can and will determine the extent of the affect of Russia's meddling.  It may be a best guess, but it won't be screened through a Putin filter...ahem.

t1_dsw0b2o	1	*	Nice gesture.
t1_dswpgzg	1	*	I know, I wasn't trying to.
t1_dswj6sk	0	*	They haven't yet invented a word to describe an economic philosophy that amounts to stabbing yourself in the dick with a huge grin on your face. 
t1_dsxc03f	0	*	Bolivar is a currency. Bitcoin is not. What part of this are you not understanding? 
t1_dsxhpwf	0	*	No, socialism requires a dictatorship. The socialism that exists inside your mind is not real socialism. The real socialism is the one that EXISTS in the world and history. 
t1_dsw01cl	1	*	Very generous of you! 
t1_dsxxn7v	0	*	How do you think he's supposed to leave?
t1_dswrj39	1	*	And even moderate Fascism is still a bad thing. Capitalism is the best system, socialist is an unfair, selfish, unworkable, oppressive system. 
t1_dsvsyer	0	*	the fact that you say ruling class means that it was never a capitalist society
t1_dubyr72	0	*	Its not hard now you understand the difference between legal and non legal consequences. 
t1_dsetxtg	1	*	>I live in Australia    Then, you can stfu about knowing anything about cops in MY country.     
t1_dsvn0s3	0	*	You said they're work visas.  I asked you to prove it. Instead you've been whining at me, so please provide the percentage of them that are work visas 
t1_dsusw2g	0	*	Keyword being if. And your idea of fixed is laughable.
t1_dsuvnyv	0	*	Sounds like a good time to change your political views.
t1_dsvcxwq	1	*	I guess it's the motivation. Racists seem to be motivated primarily by irrational hatred, which extends way beyond economics. 
t1_dsutwqb	1	*	who were intercepted so more than 415,000 technically right? Honest question, the wording is just confusing me a bit. I knew a lot of illegals were from overstay, so I'm not questioning that.
t1_dsusbxx	0	*	Massive influxes of cheap foreign labor distorts market forces.
t1_dsuy12e	0	*	It's not about deserving, it's about the country not getting worse to the point no one wants to come here.
t1_dsuxagk	1	*	If only workers could band together to demand higher wages and benefits...some type of union of workers. 
t1_dsv0nt6	1	*	yeah right forgot how thousands of Canadians try to illegally immigrate to the US every year
t1_dsux587	1	*	I tend to have literally the opposite view.  A chain is only as strong as it's weakest link. 
t1_dsvevbq	0	*	Great than let's get rid of the welfare state and we'll both be happy!
t1_dsv4gsy	1	*	Because that would hurt their voters. 
t1_dsv0s54	1	*	Uh, did you read that? The words not guilty don't even appear in that article.  A settlement out of court is not at all the same as being found not guilty.
t1_dsvy9m6	0	*	>Haiti, because its such a great place   Dont  fucking play games. You took a shot at Haiti 
t1_dsutguy	0	*	> Ok I'll bite. How is a tariff helping the farmer?  Selling domestically that would make his produce cheaper than imports.  Do you not see how this would benefit him?
t1_dsvcz5n	0	*	*shrug* and I was salt-mining all up and down the thread. Good yuks had by all. 
t1_dsuy8sb	0	*	Agree completely. Giving illegals drivers licenses. Are you fucking kidding me Los Angeles. 
t1_dsutl65	0	*	Did I say expand food stamps? No. Im saying reducing competition increases wages for lower class workers and thus allows them to earn more money themselves. 
t1_dsus65l	0	*	Not how it works in a growth based economy, that's 14% profit to be reinvested in automating jobs to have a bigger gain next year. 
t1_dsv2i9e	0	*	How can you say that when there have been 2 million new jobs created and companies officially stating new/transfer of manufacturing factories back into specific states? Oh, it's denial. 
t1_dsuw8aa	0	*	Chain immigration is the antithesis of a merit based system. I thought reddit was generally pretty furious about the way Ivy Leagues family reward familial ties for placement?

t1_dsv10pj	0	*	I really don't think you understand progressives.

t1_dswchxe	0	*	Oh, you're a Trump supporter. Big surprise. No wonder you are so resistant to facts.
t1_dsv7v6o	1	*	And here I was thinking it was people believing bullshit stats and lies. 
t1_dsuxnad	0	*	So because someone voted for trump they automatically don't like people with dark scin?
t1_dsusib1	0	*	We elect Australia?
t1_dsuy0n6	1	*	Wow...You really stuck with it there.   
t1_dsvrt5k	1	*	Haha, no problem friendo
t1_dsut81h	0	*	> So then why not just stop giving visas to low skilled immigrants, if that's the problem?  Isn't that the entire point of this post and trump is being called racist for it?
t1_dsv90r0	0	*	Do you not think trump's language and proposed nationalist policies have emboldened them? Or brought those tendencies out in many others?   Edit: for clarity
t1_dsvbl3s	0	*	Well everyone here is arguing against the exploitation of the bottom poor class. Are you against that?
t1_dsv4g2a	1	*	Flabby, pasty-skinned, riddled with phlebitis. A good Republican body.
t1_dsusyj9	0	*	Can't really go any lower if they're the ones getting paid minimum wage. These are low skilled jobs in the United States. Natives never have and never will work these jobs
t1_dsuvgrk	0	*	I dont want anyone to be taken advantage of like that. Theres a reason we have those laws in the first place.
t1_dsuu78u	0	*	maybe you should quit reading class warfare bullshit.
t1_dsurb7d	0	*	If theres only 20 jobs, no you cant. 
t1_dsv5fjr	1	*	Labor isn't the most expensive part of food production, so if you gave them a raise of a few percent, it would more than offset the increase of food prices. 
t1_dsutbjq	0	*	Don't allow them to sell in America until they pay up. 
t1_dsutdrq	1	*	Damn Canadians stealing all the hockey and maple syrup jobs!

t1_dsv0ds2	1	*	Its not, but a low skilled worker from Haiti is statistically more likely to overstay compared to other countries.
t1_dsv3gu0	0	*	I'm pro-Israel. I'm just Pro-Israel-Not-Being-A-Cunt.  That's kinda my stance for everything though.  VOTE FOR D. ZNUTS 2028!
t1_dsv8kvb	1	*	This post, however, is fine to downvote as not only do I not agree with it, it also does not contribute to the discussion.
t1_dsus4s7	0	*	>kool-aid.  Flavor-ade. Henry Zebrowski made me say this.  
t1_dsutz7k	0	*	They get a pass because 99% of them go back, vs 60% of Haitians. It's that simple.
t1_dsusdr8	0	*	But no one, liberal or conservative, has taken it to such absurd lengths as Trump supporters.
t1_dsutlkf	0	*	Give an example then
t1_dsur5el	0	*	You can Wikipedia Haiti to see the ethnic make up. Trump's comments have targeted countries with largely black populations.
t1_dsvce2d	0	*	Either way my point is that if the US were more like Europe, it would have open borders with Mexico. 
t1_dsuub12	0	*	You claimed he is doing something good but unpopular or are you just concern posting and forgot already?
t1_dsv6pj2	1	*	You're insane if you think trillions in welfare isn't enough.
t1_dsv7siy	0	*	No, it limited *naturalization* to those people, not immigration. You do see the difference, right?
t1_dsuzokk	1	*	That's for his next term
t1_dsusl80	1	*	He might succeed in keeping terrorists out if the US continues to fall apart: the terrorists will target a better nation!
t1_dsvgplp	0	*	You were the one who mentioned CONTRIBUTION.   So back it up. 
t1_dsut6ci	0	*	That's quite an interesting logical fallacy there.
t1_dsuu62k	0	*	No point in arguing with the brainless. 
t1_dsuum2k	0	*	How many CEOs get paid $100 million? A few? Redistribute that and everyone in the US gets $1.  I'm not sure that solves many problems. 
t1_dsusv23	1	*	> You do realize, yes?  
t1_dsv9phu	1	*	Most refugees are not from Syria and are young males. Very few ladies. 30% of Syrian refugees in Europe actually come from Syria
t1_dsurize	0	*	I will vote with my dollars, but mainly to support companies that don't break the law and encourage criminal activity.
t1_dsuv306	0	*	I didn't say anything about how smart I am? I guess reading is hard for you.
t1_dsuyimv	1	*	So if no one is willing to take the job at min wage then you'd have to raise the pay until someone thought the money was worth it.   That's how it's supposed to work right? 
t1_dsv2os7	1	*	I was mostly giving you shit, don't take it seriously. As long as you aren't hurting anyone, I have no issue with your faith, my friend.
t1_dsusxc8	1	*	That really sucks,  but investing in a new (even newer) car after only 90 days at the job isn't the best idea
t1_dsushef	1	*	All this tells me is that he didn't pay a competitive rate and the only people who were willing to work for what he was offering were unskilled immigrants. 
t1_dsve9sv	0	*	Being pro trump makes me not a decent human being. Sorry I dont think we should import Mexicans to deal with the awful jobs mighty white People are to superior to do.
t1_dsusuhp	0	*	Go ahead and find a source proving that the majority of illegal immigrants are from crossing the southern border rather than visa overstays, ports, etc.
t1_dsuusx6	1	*	You realize that he probably *is* a child, right ;) I mean high school student is still technically a child
t1_dsv9m4m	0	*	How? If you even bother reading 40% of Haitians overstay their visa. 
t1_dsuwkrf	1	*	I can't believe you even had to make this point.   You wanna know what screws over workers? it's not immigrants. It's a  $7.25 minimum wage.  
t1_dsut9pg	1	*	Hey, come on now. It's like 25 at least.
t1_dsuwm6o	0	*	Because it's a dog whistle for the same folks who cheered when he said all Haitians have AIDS. 
t1_dsv735j	1	*	I did misread it! Sorry for the misunderstanding 
t1_dsut5yn	0	*	Youre right, that did come off as harsh
t1_dsv20kb	0	*	And if you had given him some legitimate studies he would just hand wave them away and probably call you racist and then dismiss you while acting superior for no reason. 
t1_dsveax7	1	*	Lol. What an ignorant troll.   I will just leave this here:   https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.vanguardngr.com/2010/10/20-most-influential-nigerians/amp/
t1_dsuysmr	0	*	Don't forget slaves. They built most of the country on slave labor. After stealing the land from native Americans of course. 
t1_dsutebu	0	*	I'm not really involved in the argument you two are apparently having, but I just want to let you know that you're being a bit of a cunt.   You should try to be better in the future.
t1_dsv3ydj	0	*	If that is the case then that should also be a higher priority than importing new people to stretch the system more.
t1_dsut5hj	0	*	Please list all the incredible things he's done for all our citzens since assuming office? Golfing the most doesn't count.
t1_dsvmcxm	0	*	You have not met most philosophy majors then.
t1_dsvlkbh	1	*	well...you tell me?
t1_dsutxv1	0	*	Probably shouldn't get into politics with your boss if you are diametrically opposed to his beliefs, or if he happens to be a Trump supporter 
t1_dsuu5nr	0	*	This just reminded me of the time NPR tweeted the Declaration of Independence line-by-line and some people were accusing them of attacking Trump.
t1_dsv7a8r	0	*	That's what I hear every person who wants an American green card or visa say. I'd really love to hear an American's opinion on that.
t1_dsutl4u	0	*	Quoting from an over decades old study. Nice. 
t1_dsvah9m	1	*	Do you need a crash course on the difference between a reddit commenter and an author of a rueters article?
t1_dsuw52b	0	*	I was imagining something with a remote controlled video camera with maybe some crosshairs and other controls as well as status display via a cell phone app.  I appreciate the.. thought..
t1_dsv8uvb	0	*	Yeah we should fuck over the majority of the people trying to do the right thing and go over on a far harder and limited legal method because *some* of them may overstay their visa.
t1_dsvl9ca	1	*	They are effective. They just need more
t1_dsursux	0	*	The person whos getting the replies youre replying to?
t1_dsuz86m	0	*	I think you underestimate how far an American dollar probably goes in Haiti.
t1_dsuw0qp	1	*	And it appears that is just the list for one year. That's concerning.
t1_dsvs701	0	*	That is the law for my state that we were just talking about....  
t1_dsxxl4o	0	*	Yes, describing an entire continent and countries as a 'shithole' was clearly shorthand for illustrating a point regarding merit based immigration. /s   You are sick. 
t1_dsvmazv	1	*	Wait, we intercepted 415k people from ~30 countries, versus 630k from ~50? That 415k number should be the focus point
t1_dsutabi	0	*	I did read the article. 100 less people to worry about. 
t1_dsv4cqa	0	*	your personal anecdote makes a compelling argument
t1_dsv6b4l	0	*	If you don't believe in God you're not a Christian. You're just pretending to be a Christian to get perks or friends.
t1_dsvqzz3	0	*	The part where you said it was anti-American to be selective about who America lets in? I was just presuming you weren't calling yourself anti-American by the way you said it 
t1_dsuu38z	0	*	They'll let him shit in their mouths so long as a liberal has to smell their breath.
t1_dsuv018	1	*	Some do.  They don't care.  They're rabid.
t1_dsuv61a	0	*	Any time. The problem is when you express a desire to not let those people come here. 
t1_dt1hk4e	1	*	Good for you, same here. Mocking the uneducated because they weren't lucky enough to get your level of education is pretty scummy either way tho
t1_dsurci6	1	*	The person you're replying to was replying to someone talking about difficulty getting into Canada.  You don't get to decide what people are talking about.
t1_dsv1kfe	0	*	Tried it. Can confirm. Faith in humanity decreased.
t1_dsuw3mv	1	*	Thank you for giving me a little more hope in humanity, friend from the North. It is very rare to find another person who can think objectively anymore on the Reddit hivemind.
t1_dsv5jvr	0	*	It makes someone racist to point out race? Maybe if you have a surface level understanding  of what racism actually is. 
t1_dsut94h	0	*	Considering theres a vocal group of Republicans who disapprove of Trump, it really does. I mean, unless you keep yourself in an echo chamber.
t1_dsvp5y1	0	*	It is. Im telling you why we let them stay here instead of sending them back. Its our bleeding hearts. Most of us suffer from them being here and arent benefiting from their cheap labor. 
t1_dsuxyh0	0	*	This country is infected with the idiotic idea that coming and being an American is a right, not a privilege
t1_dsv3835	1	*	Just those from low skilled work.
t1_dsurm1n	1	*	Maybe I read it wrong but didn't it say a dozen? Is that high numbers?
t1_dsusbha	1	*	Well, not now that they just gave out one time $1000 bonuses!   /s
t1_dsv7g17	1	*	Yeah I think this is the problem.  I understand migration should be to let people in, but no where in the world are people allowed in unvetted or without question.  
t1_dsutyke	1	*	Today, I'm proud to be a Canadian. 
t1_dsuthy1	0	*	But it was just one question, and you still haven't answered it.
t1_dsuuhts	0	*	I would hesitate to call Native Americans and slaves immigrants. 
t1_dsuvpld	1	*	its wonderful and all over reddit. luckily irl people arent nearly as rude or stupid. anyone i talk to irl can at least say positive things about the other side.

t1_dsxx38x	1	*	so you think his Klan buddies are saints?
t1_dsxgr62	0	*	Oh right the tax rate that they never paid in the first place and is now lower than what the average taxpayer? Oh yeah lets get it on with corporate welfare. 
t1_dsuwu0t	1	*	The usa also has the lowest economic monility rating in the OECD aswell.
t1_dsuutr0	1	*	That is a good point. It's really hard to tell if he is a chronic liar or just delusional and or senile. Either one would be bad enough but sadly I would wager it's a combination of all that and more.
t1_dsv1g64	1	*	the pot is full.
t1_dsv57zp	0	*	How do you think powerplants and major infrastructure projects get built? With the local yokels?
t1_dsutwou	1	*	Free markets are only good when they work in your favor apparently.

t1_dsus07g	0	*	Oh yeah if only corporations would just increase everyones pay that would be lovely. 
t1_dsv0ff7	1	*	For Trump and Trump supporters siding with Isreal isn't being pro-Jewish. It's being anti-Arab.
t1_dsv4aev	0	*	I'd imagine the people really into the idea probably are students and not people working a career. It's no money lost to them if they were to see taxes raised to pay for these people.
t1_dsuw3h2	0	*	so people with guaranteed jobs? yes the average person is going to benefit from a new taxpayer coming over. 
t1_dsvefzi	0	*	your post makes 0 sense...  are you mentally unhinged? Do you need to see a doctor?  probably, you seem to have the mental disorder known as progressivism.
t1_dsv6l7m	1	*	Wait a second, are you really comparing visa overstays to those caught crossing the border illegally? That is totally apples to oranges
t1_dsw9swf	1	*	yes approximately 40 people in 2 years overstayed.  what a crippling blow to strengthening the nation
t1_dsux565	1	*	Well if you stop giving him the easy way out, he'll eventually learn that he needs to *pay his workers more* in order to increase retention.
t1_dsv88gv	1	*	Nobody *wants* a low paying job but many will take low paying jobs to sustain long enough to find higher wages.
t1_dsuwzdc	0	*	Oh.   So you have no idea what you talking about. Got it.
t1_dsuvsy7	1	*	It sucks already.
t1_dt0wuk6	0	*	What are you babbling about?  Teachers make less.  Your friend is lying about his salary and you apparently have no idea what you're talking about.  I know PhDs only making 80-90k.  Go away
t1_dswdd1b	1	*	[Here's a bunch of them giving Nazi salutes in his name](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tisoyP43Ck8).  Like I said, it's pretty obvious unless you're being willfully ignorant.
t1_dsutqft	0	*	I'm not a conservative. I'm a registered Democrat who has only voted blue. I just don't support an open border policy.
t1_dsv5ecx	1	*	The UK wasn't part of the Schengen area, and they did restrict migration pre-Brexit. Which makes that whole affair even more mind boggling to be honest.
t1_dsv3bay	0	*	Uhhh Obama gave the insurance companies so much power that the prices of healthcare has went up like 40% for me alone and I havn't been to the doctor in years. It all got warped and fucked
t1_dsutljh	1	*	This. The more racist Trump appears, the more t_d insists that he's telling it like it it.
t1_dsuubq3	0	*	I mean he was discussing it the other day while talking about immigration policies. Seriously, the timing of the move isn't hard to understand.
t1_dsuyu1w	0	*	what evidence, the entire study just arrived at: fuck if we know, but everything seems to say it's pretty small either way. 
t1_dsv55q5	0	*	Yes, of course they will. Look at the shale oil boom in those states right now. All temporary work, $25 to $30 an hour or less wages, and not a hotel room or campground vacant for 200 miles.
t1_dsvbh0z	0	*	Humanitarian groups? why in the world do we have humanitarian groups in the US aiding criminals? Helping people illegally immigrate is a crime.

t1_dsvskan	0	*	I don't need you to care about me. That's for me to worry about. 
t1_dsv5myo	1	*	You could double their pay, and it would only increase produce prices by about 8%
t1_dsv5ygs	1	*	Its almost like we dont really want to solve the problem. We want something to bitch about constantly but dont want to do the smart thing to fix it. 
t1_dsv349y	1	*	why would you spend money educating low skill workers when you can just bring in educated Haitians to begin with lol
t1_dsuu2fh	0	*	In part, because the poor can't afford time to attend training programs because we have been depressing our wages for decades?
t1_dswt2us	0	*	They have money to spend on higher skilled workers, they dont. And even low skilled workers should be able to live of their salary while working full time. 
t1_dsuv8gs	1	*	He's probably 15 years old. Of course he sounds childish
t1_dsux1sb	1	*	Can't wait to see coal miners doing maid work at a hotel down the street like the old Haitian lady was doing. 
t1_dsvbdyi	0	*	It's not Christianity related but is used by Christians often.

t1_dsusxdh	0	*	...you mean the war in which the US and her closest allies were attacked and were fighting against fascist leaders bent on world domination?
t1_dsuyah1	1	*	Yes, but keep on thinking that way. Youre bound to get disappointed.
t1_dsv4yh5	1	*	No my point doesnt become invalid. Pardon me lets say stereotyping instead of racism. Still makes your argument weak for attacking my English instead of my arguments 
t1_dsur6uk	0	*	Thats why Im saying grand scheme. In a country of 300 million, 20 people is basically nothing. 
t1_dsve0gt	0	*	I wonder why those were placed? It couldn't have been the 1804 massacre and the events that unfolded after. 
t1_dsusjny	0	*	all politics are identity politics

t1_dsuthwe	0	*	I'll give the second and third articles a read in the morning, but the first article doesn't have any numbers to back anything up. All it did was make claims.

t1_dsv2c8z	0	*	Once again- point proven, but as you so eloquently put it: Thanks for playing dip shit.
t1_dsve4u9	1	*	Well fuck me then, I retract my previous stayement
t1_dsv8iz2	1	*	And what exactly did I 'expose' myself as?   Someone who thinks there are better ways to decide immigration than 'who you know'? 
t1_dsv8my3	0	*	Their projection knows no bounds. Shrieking little shits peacock all day about snowflakes and then go on to whine about how mean Libruls are for calling them racist/sexist/etc. 
t1_dsutr9w	0	*	Oh is that the excuse conservatives are using for stagnating wages?  Yeah I'm not buying it.
t1_dsuutww	0	*	So are you suggesting that we need to continue to import an underclass of wage-slaves to make our country great? If that's the case then I think I'd rather not be great.

t1_dsuywd5	0	*	Something like 98% (96%?) speak English as a second language fluently. 
t1_dsutyg1	0	*	What makes you say that? We want wages to increase no decrease. Why should we start paying people less?  Edit: misread the comment. Need sleep

t1_dsusgw3	0	*	The fact that there are farmers who are White and doctors who are African American or Latino support his claim.  
t1_dsureye	0	*	Its kinda like yelling at the person who stole a million dollars to not steal 20 dollars. 
t1_dsva0x6	0	*	YOu have the ability, but clearly neither knowledge nor common sense.  Why do you keep dodging the question? You think there's no need for the allowance, why do you think that?
t1_dsuul46	1	*	It won't work. Literally just look into an crack down. Wages will never be high enough to attract people at the rate needed. Let alone what it will do to the cost of food. 
t1_dsuufsg	1	*	[You mean like this?](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/07/05/some-trump-supporters-thought-npr-tweeted-propaganda-it-was-the-declaration-of-independence/?utm_term=.20e8e10fc298)

t1_dswpd79	0	*	Indeed.
t1_dsvflq0	1	*	Cab drivers in general drive like assholes everywhere. 
t1_dsutofh	1	*	It's not just real-estate values but things like crime, education, etc.
t1_dsuv5nl	1	*	Ah-hoo!
t1_dsv0ril	0	*	Your mouth is  a shithole too. 
t1_dsuw2c4	0	*	You can call it whatever word makes you feel better, it doesnt make you any more right lmao
t1_dsuteku	1	*	> $16/hour, which is about $3 more than burger king  Is it only 3$ an hour more effort expended?  
t1_dsutas2	1	*	No he settled without admission of guilt. Not the same thing. Do you think the investigation that took the case to court just made things up? 
t1_dsuu2q5	0	*	Americans?
t1_dsv6q6o	0	*	Yeah that's called sarcasm. My bad, I thought it would be obvious by the overall tone of my comment.
t1_dsv2p6a	0	*	> But who are these 100 people?  I'm not sure, but I bet this means a lot to them. 
t1_dsusb65	1	*	I'd be fine with that.

t1_dsuussr	1	*	Not if you only need 30% or less because of Gerrymandering and low turnout.
t1_dsviy4s	1	*	Yes because getting some one to voluntarily pay people a higher wage is diffrent then holding a gun to their head and saying You have to pay certain wage.
t1_dsv427p	0	*	       So you're not even American?  Fuck off.    
t1_dsuvtyc	0	*	I guess I succumbed to fake news. My bad.   Switch Mexico for Israel and the point stands.

t1_dsv1wg0	1	*	Not to mention many of the issues that republicans complain about in Obamacare are only there because of republicans 
t1_dsuspz0	0	*	Do you think the 80 countries that are allowed to send low skill immigrants are not the source of low skill immigration?
t1_dsut1xs	1	*	20 people. A $50 tax break affects more people than this. Its not hating Trump to say he basically did nothing while getting a headline.

t1_dsvbmjb	1	*	Tell that to the IRS whose page I just linked that says you damn well have to
t1_dsv886c	0	*	If you open the report, it clearly says Haiti had a 39% visa overstay rate in 2016.
t1_dsuvy3q	0	*	> Minimum wage was $4.25 and I made $7.15 an hour.  That's pretty fucking shit. And in no way a livable wage today.  > Hardly slave wages at the time.  When, 1929? 
t1_dsvt5m0	0	*	>  Haitians and Dominicans had a tight knit relationship   What? This country has never had a tight knit relationship with Haiti. It is true tensions weren't always this high, but never tight knit. 
t1_dsv1kbh	0	*	I like how this has become a thing.  Any time someone mentions trump and doesn't immediately vilify him,  they *must* be a subset of this subreddit right?   You're pathetic. 
t1_dsvcbm8	1	*	Shithole 
t1_dsvcjdt	1	*	Never had an I94 signed by anyone at my school from 2012 to 2016. I only had the paper 1 for a year though and they never signed it either.  EDIT: To be fair i also lost it.

t1_dsvb82v	0	*	You are a fool. 
t1_dsv5gll	1	*	So the exact one we are discussing, but not it specifically?
t1_dsv7ntx	0	*	American checking in. This is categorically untrue. There are fucking shitloads of Americans that want those jobs.  Edit: but most of us could do without the low wages...
t1_dsviley	0	*	Wow! That's amazing. I can't even imagine how good it must have been then considering how good it is now. 
t1_dsv5ygz	0	*	everybodys on the spectrum
t1_dsuy6vf	0	*	Replace whitey with American citizens then. Your bias is still very obvious.
t1_dsv76cx	0	*	ok so how about you address my argument instead of if I like a politician or not?
t1_dsvljao	1	*	No, it points out that the ability to do good doesn't create an obligation.  There are other factors that need to be considered
t1_dsvhfuz	1	*	Belize and Samoa are the other two.  I mistakenly thought Jamaica was included, but they're still allowed to use the visas
t1_dsv4r0y	1	*	> in that case the wage will just go up by itself because the work needs to get done  That's the entire point, solve the problem without the government getting involved.
t1_dswgq61	0	*	Nah green onions.. otherwise known as french onions or scallions I believe.
t1_dsv0wh6	0	*	how is it racist to say haiti is a shithole? because black people live there?  those black people need you to defend them i guess. keep fighting the good fight
t1_dsw80qq	0	*	Hah yeah, I'm sort of a character nerd, not even a font nerd really. Just really interested in all the variations of characters that are encoded in Unicode. :-)
t1_duith3v	0	*	Are you not aware the vast majority of the world lives without indoor plumbing and running water?
t1_dt6pa3z	1	*	Unfortunately thats how the political system works.
t1_dt62oww	0	*	...right. Its the same now as it was with Obama. Except now you see articles about it because its trendy to hate trump.
t1_dt72yja	1	*	Username checks out.  I don't live there actually. I merely talk with Israelis semi-regularly.   Which part of the demographics are you asking about?
t1_dt5ycbp	0	*	Why? Why would you feel the need to disrespect their customs. Some reporters opinion doesn't matter in the grand scheme of the US's political ties to Israel. 
t1_dt672vb	1	*	No they don't, they advertise as a Jewish state. Either way there isn't equal rights, Jews can merely pray at a wall and can't rebuild their temple. 
t1_du42ec9	1	*	That is also the same as saying all germans are racist because of the nazis, which in fact is racism. 
t1_dtt5las	1	*	You make it seem as though I'm avoiding a fact. It's your opinion.
t1_du61jdn	0	*	How did the Sri Lankan Army defeat the LTTE?
t1_dswdxvc	0	*	Gypsies are an ethnic group, AFAIK.
t1_dsvcowx	0	*	> I don't listen to scientific facts and nobody can convince me otherwise.  Proud to be uneducated.
t1_dsw0sha	1	*	My god youre obnoxious
t1_dsv32r2	1	*	US looks worse and worse when you describe it like that.
t1_dswvf7l	1	*	The USA's two party system is just bullshit to be honest. Here in the UK we basically have only 2 parties with a decent shot at forming a government as well, and it's shit.
t1_dswe1rh	0	*	The War Department? Dude, either your information is heavily out of date, or you've got a serious bias you need to overcome. It hasn't been called that in 70 years.
t1_dsvjtqc	0	*	So in context, following on from those paragraphs with the quote I posted, that still suggests that US Infant Mortality is not as good as it possibly should be.
t1_dsv0zcb	1	*	I think everyone knew Trump would cut taxes for his rich buddies, pal.
t1_dsvh2bz	1	*	Except our status and global influence. Y'all think we can go back to the way things were in the 1800s. It's short sighted and ill informed at best. You live in a globalize society. Adapt or fail. 
t1_dt83zvt	1	*	Keywords and tricky phrases... my bad.
t1_dsz0wid	1	*	>They fucked up.  That's just your opinion, opinion not showing in the last election. Until you impeach him, he is still legit and you representant for the world.

t1_dsz1ueh	0	*	I'm making fun of how people are so into the politics of a nation they don't live in or have ever lived in just because it's their ancestors homeland.
t1_dsv5i06	0	*	Mainstream economists, not all economists, to be precise. ;)
t1_dsvcd9y	0	*	I was very young back then, so I had assumed the senate was a dem majority. I looked it up and you are completely correct. I apologize for pushing a false point. 
t1_dsw3tne	0	*	Man fuck off with that strawman argument.
t1_dsvzq2r	1	*	So again, it was assumed I was poorer than average because I am a Latino, and somehow that is NOT racist. I guess the context here (there was none) excuses the stereotype. Got it. 
t1_dsx12fm	0	*	Enjoy your hell :-)
t1_dsvxnps	1	*	The state of israel and the government of Israel are much more than just the leader of the country. 
t1_dsvm0em	1	*	>well he was massacring his own people for starters.   So you're in favour of invading Iran ?
t1_dsvcyxo	0	*	I actually think people like you should be banned from voting. And i'm not even going to adress anything you said, because it's so wrong on every single point.
t1_dsv5joc	1	*	What a shithole 
t1_dsv6wn7	1	*	Correct.

t1_dsvy3tz	0	*	Fairly certain he's just using an analogy that most people would understand. 
t1_dsv22pb	0	*	Our main national news channel thought trump getting peed on was newsworthy enough to put it on the news.
t1_dswvl6m	1	*	A republic is a democracy. A form of democracy that doesn't work. 
t1_dsv8wuj	0	*	Why? Millions of cases arent enough? Better yet, since its online, they show their more extremists views.   Are you brain damaged? is a good way for me to assume that you're a douchebag, for example. 
t1_dsvab7s	0	*	Why are you calling me stupid while agreeing with my point?  Its not that I mind, it just doesnt make sense
t1_dsvgg4t	0	*	So what you're saying is that the USA is a shithole?
t1_dsvk5kh	0	*	Everything I don't like is librul trash fake news!  The absolute state of right discourse these days smh...
t1_dsv2yb3	1	*	Yes i know, these are my points... also how huge of an illegal alien problem do yu have and how does it effect the incarcaration rate?
t1_dsw0xj5	1	*	Highest spending, yet I don't pay a cent for hospital and doctor visits..... 
t1_dsvulao	0	*	I would love to see what he actually said 
t1_dsvsyob	0	*	But his daughters and their husbands are American Jews, not Israelis. And it is fact the overwhelming majority of American Jews support Israel.

t1_dsv88h7	1	*	Mentally stable genius at work
t1_dslo6dp	1	*	Nah, not with Trump. With him, it would be more memorable if he managed to go a week *without* saying something so stupidly offensive.
t1_dskhbu8	0	*	We have enough poor and uneducated people in this country. We don't need more. Granted, the Republicans fail to help them as well, but that's why I don't vote for them.
t1_dskziy1	0	*	I think hes a racist.  I just dont think that calling a place a shithole is in and of itself racist.  Who hasnt called sole country or city a shithole?
t1_dsly3nr	0	*	It takes time but not over 200 years. Plenty of other countries with slave pasts that are doing good much better. Practically all of them are doing better than Haiti. 
t1_dsleyu6	1	*	It seems like it's an opinion piece when you say you hear inaudible groans no one else does.
t1_dslagmk	0	*	lol
t1_dsn61sf	1	*	And Im president. 
t1_dskus8q	0	*	No, that is the entire point!

t1_dsl06dz	0	*	Why don't other countries take these Hatians, is every leader on the planet racist?

t1_dskodz0	0	*	All politics is identity politics. But no obviously not. Of course people defending Trump can't actually think so you just try to fit everything into a neat little box you can dismiss lmao. 
t1_dskm12r	1	*	Is their financial history a comfort to the hundreds of thousands of slave currently in Haiti?  
t1_dsknpu6	1	*	Besides the fact that they are our founding principles. America is unique in that. 
t1_dskiauq	0	*	I'm sure some are. But i also don't think calling a wide group nazis when most probably aren't is a good idea. But by all means, make nazi mean nothing, and make yourself look retarded.

t1_du0tdsg	0	*	Spoken like a prick.
t1_du0vj1b	0	*	To be fair, 197 trials isnt nearly enough to be taken seriously from a sample size perspective.  Unless there is more data available we cant really say it works or it doesnt based off that.
t1_du239qv	0	*	And also that doing so will cure the world of Ford motors.  
t1_du180kp	1	*	Just go out in the woods and drink straight from a stagnate pond.

t1_du134jr	0	*	As long as what theyre saying to me right now makes sense and stands up to skepticism, I dont care where they post elsewhere.
t1_du0wd61	0	*	some memes are more overused than other memes. some memes are more annoying than other memes. all memes are used alot doesn't make that not true.
t1_du0vaxk	0	*	Yes just not the all bullshit part. The guy who said it worked for him was probably right. The problem is that he could have saved money if he just went directly to a specialist.
t1_dsp7vq4	1	*	> The CIA were forthright in what they wanted: they wanted her to sleep with him. The decision was up to her.  lol okay. Next time the CIA tell you to do something, don't do it! Easy peasy. 
t1_dsojfb0	0	*	You got examples of Jordan siding against them and that's supposed to mean something? 
t1_dsx5tqv	0	*	Ah yes the Armenians who were massacred by the Turks in WWI. Need I go on? And N. Iraq isn't Turkey. 
t1_dsx3p08	0	*	They can still poison the environment by preaching there warped views.  A Nazi is a Nazi and should be wiped out.
t1_dsxogio	1	*	Chamberlain gripped his umbrella so tightly his knuckles turned white.  
t1_dsxaudv	1	*	It's similar how to first world countries still exploit 'former' colonies, which combined with corruption and western corporate interests impedes progress significantly.
t1_dsxoaud	0	*	Yeah thats what I was poking at too. Reddit seems to think that because some Kurds give a shit about women and identify as socialists, there's no way they can be anything remotely close to Muslim.
t1_dsxmv80	1	*	More complicated, sure, but nothing particular revelatory or significant to this discussion, at least that I can discern.
t1_dsxh9pu	1	*	Maybe.. Not sure.  But it definitely sounded like wooohhloooohlloooo

t1_dsyhlpl	1	*	...which is what happened to pre-war Poland in the post-war era. 
t1_dsxgyi4	0	*	If they had planned to fight a little bit earlier then the Nazis would have been swiftly defeated, none of what they did directly helped Poland either, that's why it was called phony. 
t1_dsxay29	1	*	>What ever man you win   Thanks :-) means a lot. I'd advise you to read up on Turkish history FYI. For someone who claims to be from there you are forgetting an awful lot of stuff.

t1_dsxpsjz	0	*	Yes. Turkish soldiers escorting the Armenians have died as far as I know. If they wanted to kill them why wouldn't they do it instead of making them walk all the way to syria? 
t1_dsy492f	0	*	It's actually just not socialism...
t1_dt008t3	1	*	You mean kick them out like the arab world did to close to 1 million Jews in 1947, which Israel absorbed?  Or the closer to 500,000 arabs came to Israel to try to stop a Jewish state from forming?

t1_dshai06	1	*	>I mean HIV sucks really bad, but its not literally as bad as Ricin or Anthrax  You are right.  Vaccines exist for Anthrax but not HIV.  Many can be completely, 100% be cured of Anthrax, but not HIV.
t1_dsgowh0	0	*	Weird how it's always Muslims throwing gays off of buildings and stoning adulterers though, huh? Buddhists need to up their game.

t1_dtg1ojm	0	*	Only people without proof make grand statements without sources.
t1_dtgc5bq	1	*	Stupidity, easily swayed, tired of the way things are and hope he will deliver on his bullshit promises. The same reason America voted for trump and Brits voted for brexit.
t1_dthf4oe	1	*	Oh right on! I did not know that. Learn something new every day. haha
t1_dtgbnty	0	*	That's what we Americans thought Trump was, too. He lost two primaries prior to 2016, yet now can claim he won the first election he participated in without his followers even fact checking him. Fuck.

t1_dtg0sen	0	*	So, what in your text said Man, if the UK would not be in the EU I could now do [...]?  In your everyday life, how did sovereignty ever effect anything? Apart from nationalism and racism?

t1_ds9y9yt	0	*	I'd say famous is a better way to put it.  There are lots of very successful Canadians who never became Americans.  You're just thinking its the case because of so many Canadian/American Celebs. 
t1_dsbl1hf	1	*	But who gets to define the line? Where/when do we draw it? At one point Mongols controlled most of Asia. At one point Rome controlled most of Europe. How do you decide what the original, borders are?

t1_dsaoe6s	1	*	So then what's your point in your first response? I was saying he doesn't have any qualifications that would put him in the category of survival expert.

t1_duab83d	0	*	Wait, his current behaviour is the LEAST embarrassing way? I don't want to see the most embarrassing way then...
t1_dua4ryq	1	*	What ever mate, run along now, have fun
t1_dua4hs1	0	*	That's not what I said. You said anyone who didn't have the right to vote has an unimportant opinion, I'm saying that's a ridiculous thing to suggest.
t1_dub7dx8	0	*	Take a sheet, young mathematician 
t1_duaa8cg	0	*	i'd bet you anything that majority is gone by now and would be doubly visible in a re-vote
t1_duabp8r	0	*	You would, or you will?
t1_duaqxec	0	*	Educating people isn't a fantasy it's a reasonable thing that is entirely achievable and we shouldn't stop the progress of free trade until we figure it out entirely. 
t1_duackkl	0	*	> What evidence has been proven to be true?    For which allegation?    
t1_duac7v7	1	*	Yes, and if you've noticed, the EU is run by a cabal of bureaucrats and bankers.  I think Corbyn's an idiot, but that's not his crowd.
t1_duaj140	0	*	You know Wales voted on majority to leave the EU....just sayin
t1_dua9svl	1	*	Why doesn't some Beir as part of negotiations just remove A50. Then, everyone would be like, well, time to drink tea, nothing to be done here.
t1_ducnyca	0	*	You lot being the human race  And pointing out the name pure_race is heavily tied to racial purity = pulling out pitchforks
t1_dua9mkh	0	*	Right, which sounds pretty reasonable if the commission agrees.  What if they don't agree?   
t1_duaaq9s	0	*	The EU *doesn't want* to do anything against Britain. In fact diplomats have repeatedly encouraged Britain to withdraw article 50 and just stay in the EU
t1_duab1wn	0	*	Mhmm yeah. But doesn't Scotland have more history of independence than Catalonia or are they equal in that sense?
t1_duac8ra	1	*	No, that's the action movie star. You mean Flock of Seagulls.
t1_duapx0u	1	*	Yep, but just like every other presidency the incoming president will take ownership of the boom and give it off once it falls.
t1_duaaw7h	1	*	Globalism (global liberalised capitalism) is diametrically opposed to Marxism. 
t1_duawftt	1	*	With this comment, there's only one conclusion possible: you don't know what the words globalist or Marxist mean and are simply using them as bad words for people you don't like.
t1_duab8xw	1	*	Yeah the Milky Way and Andromeda collision is likely to have pretty much zero effect on the earth/ the Galaxy other than giving a spectacular view when it happens.
t1_duaccvu	0	*	Ya but they are clinging to a majority vote in an explicitly non-binding referendum.

t1_duaddsc	0	*	Yea all those Obama policies that inconveniently took effect on November 9th, 2016. Maybe Obama was expected a different result and wanted his would be successor to look good?
t1_dual0pt	1	*	It's that duplicitous contempt for the electorate that makes me wish him ill.
t1_duc2tgb	0	*	Ah yes, the historically strong and reliable euro. 
t1_duadh2z	0	*	Saying most of the hate is on the left and citing Antifa is the same as comparing most republicans to nazis.

t1_duaarxs	0	*	Minorities knew that for ages but always got attacked when they pointed it out
t1_dualiuo	0	*	United Kingdom of Great ReBootain?
t1_duau0g7	0	*	Yeah stupid of me to assume you would know what I meant. If you can't afford a 15% increase in travel money for when you travel away, then you have bigger problems.

t1_ds399bq	0	*	Ah, the pseudo-science bullshit of the Alt-Right.

t1_duzivy5	0	*	i guess it wasnt clear that i meant they wont self regulate in a way that doesnt give them profits.
t1_duz8pyg	0	*	The government as a whole is the victim, not the corrupt individuals. You used the entire government as part of your phrase.
t1_duz6pca	0	*	well i dont expect companies to self regulate. im just commentng on the fact that they literally own legislators to skew laws in their favors.
t1_dts7ctf	1	*	I agree that he should be punished. But the punishment is astronomically far away from fitting the crime.
t1_dstr9pv	0	*	Forts are not settlements. Forts are military defensive structures.

t1_dur228o	1	*	Neither should be allowed to rule the other. The president should have so little power, that it doesnt matter who is elected. 
t1_dusbaee	1	*	No one said it was. Having white supremacists on your cabinet is though.
t1_duqvkz3	0	*	You just misquoted me a half inch from the original comment, can you really claim to not be lazy?
t1_duqyc2i	0	*	What should that matter? Do you think New York policies would apply very well to Alaskan citizens?

t1_durr3ym	0	*	Wait, so you're saying you think just because the states joined a couple hundred years ago, the terms of their admission are now null? Not how it works. 
t1_dur0k2h	1	*	I got him at -170 so far. It's sad how for so many people this is a full time job - defending shitty human beings.
t1_duqwdi4	1	*	They are the minority.
t1_duuyrnf	0	*	So you're ok with ww3?
t1_durpf2y	0	*	Or you know, a check against mob rule. Democrats are known to run big cities, possibly because they are not exposed to the individualistic ideology of the rural life.
t1_durdv75	1	*	A reminder that the Democrats are not some wonderful perfect organization who outclasses the GOP in ever regard.
t1_dsvjv1x	0	*	I'm not talking about money spent, I'm talking about policies implemented.  When you crack down hard on people from one country, but barely enforce people from another country, that is discrimination.

t1_dswhq89	1	*	Was that a rebuttal?  Seems like you were just blowing smoke out your ass.
t1_dsuohy9	1	*	What you say is true. I will not defend the plan. I think it is horrible. But almost everyone will receive some sort of tax cut albeit small and temporary.

t1_dt6mdyc	0	*	Good financial plan - please explain.
t1_dt76xt2	0	*	Yes and no. They still buy cars, they just buy used cars to avoid the tax. It's prohibitively expensive to drive a car due to the cost of fuel though. 
t1_dt7055t	0	*	I think Walmart purposefully keeps them below 40 hours as well to avoid having to pay for health insurance for part time employees. 
t1_dt72zxc	0	*	> Wait until they cut Medicare and social security, robbing you of the money you have already paid into it.   Well that money is already gone, so
t1_dt720qs	0	*	Yes, but then the money belongs to ThomasVeil Corp, not you. So you can't spend it to pay your bills, or your vacations, etc.
t1_dt72m3g	1	*	Sure thing!
t1_dt71sfl	1	*	Sadly most don't even get to work full time making the problem worse.
t1_dt70iy7	1	*	Close, People's Liberation Army (China)
t1_dt702gf	0	*	Because we'd rather pay 400% markup on labor from Blackwater and Haliburton to wash clothes and run the fucking px. 
t1_dt72vg0	0	*	You just credited a tax cut that didnt exist for creating 2 million jobs... 
t1_dt6xkfn	0	*	It's not like they're not paying any taxes. Low taxes are important to stimulate companies to keep their money here instead of abroad and encourages new corporations to start.
t1_dt7er7l	1	*	Oh, so it'll be even lower. Nice!
t1_dt77lp7	0	*	Please stop being such a beta you care what two people on the internet think. 
t1_dt6ynkf	0	*	I'm not going to listen to you with a name like that!!
t1_dt79t93	1	*	The 41% included fuel, sales, and property estimates in the highest tax state in the country. When thats barely over 40% I feel comfortable calling bullshit on saying its close to 50% in most states. 
t1_dt7ryn3	1	*	I remember when my son could get a job at the local Walmart bagging groceries, my grandson cannot find work because amazon shut that store down
t1_dt7dx65	0	*	What line of work are you in? I'm a mechanical engineering student, curious about what the future holds for me lol.
t1_dt77q2q	1	*	lmao, not an argument.
t1_dt7506w	0	*	Takes one to know one I guess.   And find your own dam insults. 
t1_dt8pz03	1	*	It is amazing how many people are replying with irrelevant nonsense.  Was my point unclear, or do people need to feel right so badly they don't care whether or not they actually are?
t1_dt70ryr	0	*	This is a fundamental question about governance: Should they have done it regardless of public opinion?
t1_dt81ffa	1	*	Again, why is this the assumption?  The rich will always squirm out from laws?
t1_dt7248j	1	*	Nearly every single one. 
t1_dt722s8	1	*	Today I'm fed up.
t1_dt76hl0	0	*	AI and machine learning is making quick progress in that regard. It will be a shame when we have to look to Skynet for salvation.
t1_dt72fwq	0	*	This is a naive view.  Work is paid based on value not based on whether the person can live on the wage.  The real issue here is that live means something different to every person.  
t1_dt78n37	0	*	Well that's just like your opinion man.
t1_dt711cm	1	*	Huh. Well, FML.
t1_dt81uxy	0	*	Are you suggesting we tax them 90%?
t1_dt6ur6n	0	*	Yep. I live in Texas but my business is filed in Delaware.  You just need a registered agent to file it for you and youre golden. My Delaware Corp owns all my other corps. 
t1_dt6q34k	0	*	Well nice attempt at least. Contrary to what millennials think, Americans had nice healthcare pre-Obama. It was actually cheaper for most and better coverage for many back then.
t1_dt74rm2	0	*	In Canada, tuition for all levels of university are highly subsidised by government. One could make the argument that doctors benefit from having to pay a subsidised education through society. 
t1_dt725u4	1	*	Moving the goal posts I see
t1_dt76lpi	1	*	>the supply of agricultural products  Dairy only. Supply management only applies to milk, cheese, etc. There's no supply management for fruits, vegetables, or grains. 
t1_dt716pd	1	*	Huh. Well me too, thanks.
t1_dt6zjw3	1	*	I believe OP is talking solely about the private sector.
t1_dt78zqv	0	*	What do you think happens when poor people give birth to more poor people in nations where welfare exists?
t1_dt71knw	1	*	You cant be happy
t1_dt75l5n	1	*	To a point. Once you hit the cap for the year ($127k in 2017) you are no longer taxed social security.
t1_dt6wdyx	1	*	Hmm i get your points, but I think you're expecting the economy to behave the same way it was during the 16 years of Bush/0bama. Trump knos da wey, and he will make America great again.     
t1_dt8lr85	1	*	We subsidize Walmarts Health insurance, try again.
t1_dt75b98	1	*	Texas has ~28 million people and no state income tax.
t1_dt8hmw2	0	*	Well. It is kinda.   Not in a scooby doo kinda sense.  But In a Russia post ww1 sense. 
t1_dt6z0ti	1	*	>  kill citizens united,  No thanks. I'd prefer it remain illegal to ban books, especially of a political nature.   
t1_dt6mvge	0	*	I don't see you pissing yourself about white muslims.
t1_dt87tcz	0	*	I don't get why your comparison is relevant
t1_dt6m62p	0	*	http://www.dw.com/en/german-study-links-increased-crime-rate-to-migrant-arrivals/a-42006484  You should read the threads you comment in. It makes you look less ignorant than those you're calling such.
t1_dt6qha0	1	*	Would you care to elaborate? Also, don't lump me in with alt-righters, please
t1_dt70k31	0	*	But why did 8 years of Birtherism not hurt his chances with them? Hillary being Hillary hurt her chances with them, but why did 8 years of Birtherism not hurt his chances with them?
t1_dt6y2pe	0	*	You guys can't, since I only ever see you pissing yourself over brown people.
t1_dt9yz4u	0	*	I said I prefer refugees than Nazis. There isn't much to infer from that other than I don't like Nazis, but if the shoe fits...
t1_dt6lb2a	1	*	'I'M ASKING QUESTIONS, STAN!' /S  -South park, cartman, episode 'titties and smurfs' A.K.A the one with cartman doing the school morning announcements.
t1_dt6qdfi	0	*	> I have one account on reddit and I don't spam.  I know for a fact you don't. Thanks for the spam though.
t1_dt6rwl5	0	*	Well, when no ones doing shit about brigades it is.
t1_dt6qm83	0	*	> So you assume a wall of links A.K.A dropipng knowledge is akin to 'an agenda'.  Yeah. That many links. You live in politics, lgbt, etc and you don't have an agenda? I believe that.
t1_dt6s611	0	*	Not at all.  That's a real preference of Europeans using weapons.
t1_dt6m78s	0	*	And that supports your claim that almost all brown people want to kill the gays, how?
t1_dt6lzn2	1	*	> However I love the irony here, you cry racism at the first chance but are fine generalizing other populations.  It's only OK for left-wingers to make sweeping generalisations.
t1_dt6lb7b	0	*	if you're not afraid of brown people, why are you so opposed to them being near you?
t1_dt6mm52	0	*	The bible says about the same but I don't see you ranting and raving about christians.
t1_dt6ibid	0	*	I dunno do you think Batman will ever beat the Joker for real? Or is Gotham always gonna be in danger of TeRrOR?
t1_dt89l1t	1	*	You said entire Islamic world, which is patently false as in this very thread a gay Muslim has explained their experiences, which seem to show you to be entirely incorrect. Again - please stop lying.
t1_dt829xt	0	*	I will not discuss with a t_d mod. All hope is lost. I have absolutely no respect for you and you are not worth my time. 
t1_dt6liq7	1	*	All I'm seeing is that the Nazis tried to kick all the jews out to Palestine while they got the ovens ready.
t1_dt6ojr8	0	*	Please do explain my logical fallacy
t1_dt70w7j	0	*	Not an argument.
t1_du8u0j8	0	*	The apartheid in which the ethnosupremacist regime is forcing their citizens and non citizens in illegally occupied territories. Disgusting people. Boycott Divest and Sanction! 
t1_dud41jr	0	*	You are an idiot. Clearly Australian police do it differently than in Chicago
t1_dulm0i4	0	*	Because mob rule isn't popular everywhere... 
t1_dspyc91	1	*	My first link did so by individual states, federal spending was about 60 billion for the given year and state and local was about 550 billion.,
t1_dsr4sl6	0	*	You seem to be tantrumming again, in obvious defeat.
t1_dspyodw	1	*	Yeah... I don't you quite grasp the implications of UAVs with independent AI.  The F-35 is being called the last manned fighter development program for a reason.
t1_dtn9gr8	0	*	Laymen's terms
t1_duq090v	1	*	I'll leave that one where you left it ha ha ha  If Alex Jones says there's fish people in tanks and have 'facts' well...
t1_dupajwa	0	*	Lol you think only the smartest of the smart get 4 year degrees.   40% of the entire country has a 4 year degree. 
t1_dupgj09	0	*	I once saw a teacher on TV, the above comment may well be accurate. 
t1_ds3zvz5	0	*	So whats the plan boss?
t1_du6r7qu	0	*	You should re read the comment string
t1_du55zs0	0	*	> as competition wastes a fuckton of resources.  Competition is literally seeing who can do the best while using the least. The fuck are you on about.
t1_dsnlxnu	1	*	That's what fires are for ;)

t1_duqjvcs	1	*	Thank you typo fixer. May all your IRBs go smoothly. 
t1_duqzl5l	1	*	Yes, which I find concerning.  IF they have a question in their title, I assume the answer is no.  But I go check the actual study just to be sure.
t1_dumzz1v	1	*	No, I'm not. It horrifies me.  I'm making fun of your nationalistic stupidity.   May your comments here, tonight, haunt you for the rest of your life.
t1_dun9xkb	0	*	yes, yes China is undeveloped...LOL they all still live in Yurts... LOL Fucking stupid Americans. 
t1_dth09no	1	*	His retort will be that we don't die from preventable diseases anymore and we have cell phones now.  He gets his talking points from Michael Savage.  He's just a troll.
t1_dti7018	0	*	Why do you only point out non-diverse countries?
t1_dtimypc	1	*	because people love believing America is the worst thing to ever happen to the world. 
t1_dthkxui	0	*	Locals are frequently complicit in their own country's exploitation, all they would need to do is find a Liberian who is willing to sell out for cash.
t1_dthio9p	1	*	>anti-american circlejerk    Actually I bet most of us ARE American, we are just more informed, sensitive, and object to senseless suffering. Didn't know that was anti American.
t1_dthbwru	1	*	^ so true
t1_dsnmbc3	0	*	Wow! Keepon doing what your doing  dude. Do you mind me asking where your at? Love you pick your brain over a beer sometime
t1_dsnox9r	1	*	Also, more capital punishment!!!!! Kill people for killing people!!!!!  That's seriously a thing.
t1_dsmgflv	0	*	Damn, fuck you for putting me in a position of *agreeing* with a red piller, but none of that has anything to do with whether it's a logical belief.
t1_dso9n3f	1	*	No idea what that is but you've got me interested...  Anywhere I could do some reading on it?
t1_dso12m5	1	*	I was just going to say this. Florida is America's sweaty taint.  
t1_dsmg64b	1	*	Couldn't have said it better myself. Thank you
t1_dsodi6d	0	*	So you have nazis in government and you're worried about scientologists in the u.s.?
t1_dsn4j2t	0	*	Thats probably a result of that old thing about Siberian prisons being so awful that people didnt commit crime more than once.   
t1_dsms5jl	1	*	!redditbully 
t1_dsn2ts9	0	*	Nope, then you're Chrono Crossing the river and the timecops will get you
t1_dsmn28o	0	*	Clearly if you think there is no such thing as true, then we will make no progress here. 
t1_dubny4n	0	*	Yeah, but isn't it a coincidence that your post history looks like a pretty convincing impression of a Putin stooge? Like seriously, where does your interest in pro-Putin politics come from? 
t1_dtqur9x	1	*	8/10 Germans killed in WW2 were killed by Russians.
t1_dtr5xql	0	*	Kind of weird for people to admit they committed war crimes then. I don't know why you're defending someone who openly admits it. 
t1_dts1win	1	*	Read the article again.   Nothing covered air bombing. 
t1_dtrloig	1	*	I can see your point with civilians that work for the war machine, killing working adults is one thing, makes some sense, killing children has no excuse.
t1_dtri9j0	1	*	Well, Japan was not really a democracy, so I would say no, the citizens arent necessarily responsible for what their leadership did?
t1_dtqdqjv	0	*	And to deny that they were only able to survive long enough to do that work by the support of the rest of the Allied powers is just as ignorant
t1_dtrklov	1	*	https://www.globalresearch.ca/the-real-reason-america-used-nuclear-weapons-against-japan-it-was-not-to-end-the-war-or-save-lives/5308192  Here, not even the US military at the time agrees with you.
t1_dtro20p	0	*	Im sorry but why is the USA considered the only good guy with nukes? I will never understand this considering all the damage they have done in the world...  
t1_dtrolyw	1	*	To be fair if they had as many ICBMs as they have ww2 era shells we'd be similarly up shit creek in terms of interception
t1_dtqngsy	1	*	He's just an anti-US troll. Let his thread die. Enjoy the Superbowl if you're into that kinda thing. 
t1_dtrxkin	1	*	Actually those were the only ones I had. It would have been a few months before another could had been made.  We didn't even bother testing one of the desgins
t1_dtrhnyj	1	*	Oh wow, it gets better. Tell me more about the crimes the children of Nagasaki committed to deserve death.

t1_dtr6y2u	0	*	LeMay lied in his memoir and planned for the other Japanese cities to strike with nuclear weapons in the month of August just for funsies.
t1_dsqinkj	0	*	You seriously couldnt sound more dumb if you tried.
t1_dsw0afq	0	*	And now we're trying to protect our interests and rightfully so.  Just because something happened over a 120 years ago doesn't justify their actions.  
t1_duy90b8	1	*	You do not understand that there are Muslims who do try to defend persons who are unjustly persecuted. There's no explanation needed here...
t1_duxgvza	0	*	Jesus. You are delusional.
t1_dsn6y3m	1	*	Either way a kid got turned into a human bonfire, that's a pretty terrible thing to do regardless of why you do it

t1_du5w9jz	1	*	Come to Vancouver and that's an everyday occurrence with alot more junkies 
t1_dugraul	0	*	Says the player that tried to defend bringing the word morality to the discussion when it was not used either?  Irrelevant moralizing. 
t1_dtlue96	1	*	At least I wasn't sick on the day we went over how poor a rhetorical device resorting to personal attacks was gone over.  But, hey, we all have our crosses to bear!  C'est la vie!
t1_duhi65z	1	*	Any safe port. Realistically, they'll put you off at the next scheduled stop but they could potentially leave you at some random bumfuck fishing town.
t1_dufja23	0	*	This screams What do you mean budgeting is hard? Just have your parents pay your rent.
t1_dufnptt	0	*	Lol that's cute you really think the thing holding folks is just poor budgeting.  
t1_dufmcq0	0	*	What a fucking stupid opinion you have seems like an angry overreaction to me, and I would seriously hope most adults.
t1_dsl73ni	0	*	The fascist dictatorship in North Korea is a crime against its people. They are not safe from starvation, much less their own government.
t1_dslbe90	0	*	You made the claims. Why can't you provide the sources to back them up?
t1_dtv4hoa	0	*	I think I could back Israel if they hadn't been holding Lebanese prisoners. But as is tit for tat with reckless bombardments by Israel.
t1_dsrvk6m	0	*	You mean studying?
t1_dssc4ea	0	*	>  You could get the job ahead of someone who has genuinely done that degree   and if it doesn't make them more qualified, oh well.  
t1_dss1f9o	1	*	ok i changed it
t1_dssq6gf	1	*	Agree completely, but in most fields getting your foot in the door is often the hardest part.
t1_dss2o11	1	*	I'm only going by the claims you've made in this thread. But please, elaborate on your CV.
t1_dsrl6s0	0	*	It's more like a graduate tax than real debt.   They take 9% of income over xa321,000 for 30 years (or until you pay it off, if you're rich), then cancel the rest.
t1_dt7jupc	0	*	You got it all figured out bud. Good work.

t1_dsmfc1l	0	*	Please just tell me where you're going with this.  You're wasting my time.
t1_dsmgh0c	0	*	No, you gotta dig into that. Trump has HUGE mommy issues. The last video interview of her is very telling.   And both of his parents were in the Klan.
t1_dsmfzkt	1	*	That would be the last time I ventured to that rain-slicked precipice of darkness.
t1_dsmgjff	1	*	Just involve yourself in some criminal activity, make tidy profits, launder it through Trump Tower and buy yourself a nicer one. Problem solved!
t1_dsmc4y8	0	*	Well that's why you're /u/housebuye and not /u/houseselle  (Also can confirm the other comment, family member purchased a house in cash by meeting at a lawyer's office)
t1_dsmlfi0	0	*	Stop obfuscating. The suspicious part isn't that he'd want to sell it, but that somebody would pay that for it under those circumstances.

t1_dsmhbpg	1	*	Would he sell not, why?
t1_dsmibwo	1	*	Now is when we need good people in public policy the most. Theres a good chance this mess will taint public sector work for many, leaving a void that scumbags will surely fill.
t1_dsmdpw1	1	*	Which is telling.

t1_dsmedbr	0	*	No one is going to start a revolution over corrupt politicians... fucking think 
t1_dsmcghk	0	*	Ok. I have a feeling that Trump is a treasonous, corrupt, wannabe mob boss who should have been in prison 20 years ago.   But that's not how things work. Feelings don't mean shit, you need evidence.

t1_dsme7eu	0	*	Holy shit the entire system is fucked from the top down but at least you have guns.  You really live down to your username. 
t1_dsml2h3	1	*	Sure, but not in this specific discussion, being foreign wasnt mentioned at all. It essentially started with a question of how to launder money.
t1_dsmg6zo	1	*	Can confirm. HSBC employee and I am a saint!
t1_dsmmqdc	0	*	You've avoided a very important question. What country are you from?

t1_dsn4bog	1	*	I wouldnt be surprised tbh. The guy was slimey as fuck
t1_dtrk1vk	1	*	You managed to describe perfectly how I feel when I talk about this stuff on Reddit. Healthcare and workers rights are too things that I find absolutely insane about the US.

t1_dsp2rwv	0	*	Merkel is freely elected while Putin jails any dissidents.
t1_dsonmfj	1	*	Yes, it is. The loss of soverignty is horrific and why most of eastern Europe hates Russia even today. 
t1_dsprqe4	0	*	Really, you want a confession? The closest thing well get is his involvement in post-USSR countries, along with invasions.... which should probably do it for you.
t1_dsojjcv	0	*	Depends what you consider wrong lol. It's literally just the status quo continuing.  
t1_dsp32ua	1	*	Yes, it is. Ask the people of Poland or the Baltics if they would ever allow Russia to annex a peace of their country again. They would rather fight to the death. 
t1_dspf413	0	*	Difference is, the 90s were worse than the previous 50 years of USSR. 
t1_dsob8o3	1	*	Yawn.
t1_dspcrs4	0	*	According to most of the world. But I guess we should listen to a country which is constantly invading their neighbors.
t1_dsoscir	1	*	You lost that one. 
t1_dso9gg7	0	*	... I want one single example to show that what I said was fascist. Im so confused right now, I feel like you dont know what fascism is.
t1_dsoaxbs	0	*	Do you actually have a clue what Facism is? Putin is awful but he isnt a facist. Rightwing Authroianism =/= Facism

t1_dufoef0	0	*	Good for you. Is there a particular reason why you're informing me?  What exactly you're agreeing with BTW? Is it a cursing, or made up statistics?
t1_dugf1yd	0	*	So Hillary was defeated by a one trick pony...why should that make us feel better about her competence?
t1_dueq6n1	0	*	Well I'm from the US, so for me it's a distraction from all the other political crap going on. I'm pretty much already burnt out on politics just from domestic politics. 
t1_dufsy37	1	*	That's a bingo!
t1_duevk9y	0	*	> Resolving political crisis with a brute force is a sign of the authoritarian leader  No, its a sign of a bad/stupid leader. Brute force is always the last resort.
t1_dugbj3i	1	*	You have really poor reading comprehension and really poor arguing skills. Not wasting my time here.
t1_dtslwkk	0	*	Thats entirely untrue. I support the Kurds first and foremost, and I support the Russians in as much as they actually bomb ISIS.

t1_du57mh3	1	*	If its something new every other day and most proven to be false...  yeah its old.  
t1_du4ul75	1	*	Praise the Lord! This bottle just became full of alcohol! 
t1_du4o8zu	1	*	Those things are pretty widely accepted at this point, if you disagree, I can only say I wish I had your optimism
t1_du4mvcf	0	*	And movies about kids dying of starvation in a bus in the woods. 
t1_du4iffd	0	*	You say that but imagine a world where the Republican ticket was Trump / Palin.  That would be one hell of a world to live in.
t1_du4rsc8	0	*	Not necessarily lie, he's just telling his biased opinion which doesn't mean shit.
t1_du4vdbm	1	*	YEH YEH YEHEEEEE
t1_du5fobm	1	*	This isnt a 4 bedroom 2000 sqft standard commodity home though. Its going to be a lot harder to evaluate value after the fact. It would take an evaluation at the time of sale. 
t1_du50fw2	1	*	According to your source in your comment, they never admitted that.
t1_du4om2n	0	*	because they've offered no evidence, they just want me to believe that trump is a good businessman. come on man yourself.
t1_du4pe5u	0	*	I have no idea what those are or how to pronounce it so I've substituted it for parmesan. Now I have a mental image of freezing hipsters chasing cheese across Alaska. 
t1_du4np63	0	*	Are we not discussing this any further?
t1_du60a3y	1	*	> Reagan administration  I don't recall many people liking Bush at all. 
t1_du4ovr5	0	*	You idiots give 0 shits about actual sexual assault, racism, etc. You just use it as a tool to crybully about.
t1_du4nvke	1	*	There are dozens of sources every week with specific examples that anyone could refer to. You're using anecdotes to describe the population.
t1_du4qkwx	1	*	Being Ive lost faith in our justice system, I would have to agree. One can only hope for at the very least a slap on the wrist, but then again any publicity is good publicity to scum like him. 
t1_du4la3b	0	*	If thats true then Trump would not be president anymore. Yet hes going on for another term. MAGA
t1_du4nx5b	0	*	Lol, Hillary started the whole birther thing in the 2008 race haha
t1_du4qyhf	0	*	Why is option 1.) (highly unlikely)? Trumps whole business model is that he buys properties for way less than theyre worth and renovated/builds on him. Thats literally his whole schtick
t1_du4s5cd	0	*	If Clinton is so good at her job then why did she lose to someone apparently so stupid?
t1_du4ljeo	0	*	Thanks kind sir!!!  
t1_du4s7pt	0	*	That's what you are implying and why it's amusing. Unless there is proof of anything else, it looks like he just made a profit during the housing boom in the 2000s.
t1_du4p123	0	*	If Trump and Russia worked together to hack the election explain why Obama didn't say or do anything about it or even the NSA?
t1_du4npnk	0	*	no need to be sorry, i think it's funny that i'm supposed to just believe you that trump is a beautiful perfect businessman.

t1_du4o5t7	0	*	Dont you mean Bill Clinton or Joe Biden?
t1_du57p24	0	*	CNN and the word facts don't belong in the same sentence. Nor does fox. They're all shit. Use an aggregator like spydr and look at all sources so you can decide the truth for yourself.

t1_du6dkv8	1	*	If I was trying to tell you that I would be using different words.  I'm not trying to tell you anything like that. I'll just saying that the motivation to participate in money laundering exists. 
t1_du4nnqr	0	*	Yes. Most new users were the_donald. Highly unnatural. You claim that CTR pushed the_donald.  A claim that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. And yet you keep pushing it.
t1_du4ulym	0	*	>less than 1/4th of the country voting for him means people don't like him  I guess people didn't like Obama either then. 
t1_du4najf	1	*	Thanks! That's a subtle difference I've never considered.
t1_du4lwen	0	*	The house was actually appraised @$150 MM Trump sold it at a loss.
t1_du4j4vj	0	*	yes, but they are not *always* the same. that is what i am saying.  this might be nothing more than what it seems to be. just two fat old ugly rich fuckers selling houses.
t1_du6dj23	1	*	Of course not; it's just a motivation.
t1_du4rf6q	1	*	Didn't say anything about that and even if they did it doesn't change the fact that it's HIC that released it.
t1_du4in5j	0	*	TFW they found someone worse for president.  And they got elected.

t1_du564ci	0	*	Oh noes!!!! I auto corrected something bad, and now because you have nothing to stand on I've all of a sudden lost the argument because of it!
t1_du5ns8s	0	*	That is literally the dumbest thing I've ever read on this website. 
t1_du56dup	0	*	What?  Its an overwhelming number of sources that no one with a life has time to go through and verify.  The poster is counting on that.
t1_du4loo9	0	*	They got aluminum tubes!

t1_du4xbcy	1	*	Its funny that you think we are the cult.
t1_du5120p	0	*	I just wrote you a novel, but the short answer is that people have different opinions than you - and they just happened to win the presidency this time.
t1_du4nadw	0	*	Really wikipedia? Are you guys getting stupider and stupider? Meddling can range from voting booth hacking to sending a couple of campaign posters with propoganda over seas. 
t1_du4izal	0	*	May your Schwartz be long and prosper.   Yeah we know.
t1_du4o315	0	*	Do you really think people with that kind of money are affected by the economic collapse ? Im not so sure some billionaire is that hampered by the economy and its fluctuations. 
t1_du5vtaz	1	*	Yes. Japanese did it with Hawaii in the 80s. China in the late 90s on the west coast. California still suffers from this speculative bloat.
t1_du5w6dx	1	*	Their click-bait pays for their real journalism. It's dirty dirty money.
t1_du4lcpz	1	*	It's okay, we can dodge them. We know some manouveres
t1_du4zpmg	1	*	Yeah it's called Highway thru Hell, it's on Netflix. It's kind of an amusing show.
t1_du4mvws	1	*	And huskies pulling sleds.
t1_du4ovh5	1	*	And yet I am forced to everytime I hear the name Alaska.
t1_du4k8y9	1	*	I don't ever want to associate trump with Spaceballs: The Flamethrower. 
t1_du4w926	0	*	Yes you do, it's pretty apparent by your laundry list.  It's Trump Hysteria and I hate seeing good people fall into it.
t1_du4ozm3	1	*	Yeah that comment was straight out of Deliverance.

t1_du4s0ag	1	*	But does it have an exhaust port? 
t1_du4tgud	1	*	> cant defend trump on his sexual allegations  Yes I can. They are allegations. Nothing more. And he denies them. Have we had a trial that I missed?
t1_du6wbav	0	*	> revenge on Clinton  Revenge for allowing Russia to aquire 20% of our uranium too? 
t1_du6hqad	0	*	^ does this sound like something an intelligent person would write?  Didn't think so.
t1_du4pjwh	0	*	I'm not saying there's a bulletproof case here (yet), but the rationale for money laundering is certainly there. You asked what motivation may be there, and I gave you an answer.
t1_du4lhg6	0	*	So a lot of land. Was money made in the secondary transactions? What were the Shell companies doing once they had the land?
t1_du4t2ar	0	*	It's speculation about realistic, legitimate and more likely alternatives to the Trump was colluding with ~Russia~ a decade ago hysteria.  
t1_du4s6es	0	*	Real estate deals also have due diligence obligations. You can't just receive $100mil. from a random passerby, especially if the price is abnormally high. 
t1_du4ixws	0	*	Maybe he did sell his real estate to someone in Russia. He hasnt denied it yet.  Edit: It was meant as a small joke, not a political statement.
t1_du4zho2	0	*	Whatever makes you feel better.
t1_du4lnax	0	*	This is just like when Donald and co. were swearing up and down that they had no contacts with the Russians during the campaign.
t1_du50yk5	0	*	Everybody knows that
t1_du5816g	0	*	OK, see...  that's some good details.   Thanks.  However, it doesn't automatically mean this deal is one of those moments.   Right?    You realize that at least I hope...

t1_du51h18	1	*	empty lots for $35 million? Sounds legit.   Who did he sell those to? And where are you getting this information?
t1_du5lxnm	1	*	Do tell mate, do tell. 
t1_du58iwu	1	*	Seized by whom?  That also isn't money laundering. 
t1_du52289	1	*	I know! It seems super brutal, and I wouldn't want to drive that stretch of road in a normal car, let alone a huge heavy truck.
t1_du4j62k	1	*	thats the one too far?
t1_du5ekzn	0	*	It's a real show, but it's in British Columbia not Alaska.  Highway ~~Through~~ Thru *(ugh)* Hell

t1_du652h3	0	*	Arguing with leftists is always like trying to explain something to a 6 year old.

t1_dsemmz1	1	*	Yeah, back in the good ol'days of Babylon is when things're good! You 21st century babies!
t1_dse6ymv	0	*	Death and suffering changes minds.
t1_dsdgt7u	0	*	Not sure about that, maybe it's possible to land in a way that allows you to stay conscious for like a minute before you pass out and die from blood loss and lack of some organs.
t1_dsfjoxh	1	*	Kinda like how Iran claims to not have any gays, they just force them to have sex changes, exile, or killed
t1_dsd97yf	0	*	A well cut of head is probably less painful than an electric chair.
t1_dsdnnu4	0	*	Well thats good that being homosexual isnt illegal or punishable by death in the UAE.   I thought it was. 
t1_dsdhse1	0	*	Thats why theres a squad part to firing squad...
t1_dse1bie	1	*	But what if it turns out later that they aren't actually a serial killer or rapist? What then? You can't just release them from jail, since they are dead.
t1_dsdb7x3	0	*	My first reaction was that it sounds terrible but the more I think about it the more I agree
t1_dsed2g0	1	*	Right, death and suffering are not necessary.  But to place the requirement to prevent death and suffering on the people who are being attacked and/or killed for getting married is pretty sad.
t1_dsdcg0b	1	*	Compelling argument.
t1_dsd86qd	0	*	> stoning people  looks like we got a fox news viewer here
t1_dsdkwiq	0	*	> barbaric actually ~~means~~ *meant*
t1_dsdgphv	1	*	Oh bullshit, you know damn well that the word has uses beyond being a Greco-Roman pisstake of how outsiders talked, bar bar bar.
t1_dsg0f5i	1	*	No I would not use those words. Those are not other words meaning the same thing. How is our justice system better now ?
t1_dsd8173	1	*	I would rather lose a head than be poisoned 
t1_dsdidt6	1	*	Read my mind
t1_dsdpx1s	1	*	Fair enough.
t1_dse2tsl	0	*	Thing is that those that can vote with their feet do, leaving those that want to (but can't) in an increasing minority. Quite often this means that change is slower and harder to achieve.
t1_ds4sh4o	1	*	I'd say anyone who is willing to inflict physical violence over disrespect or honor is small-minded. 
t1_ds37zpw	1	*	Your rights end where other ones rights start. Do you not know basic law?
t1_ds3mbr2	1	*	you can go even further back. big parts of our constitution was inspired by the draft of the Paul's church. You can find the origins of several of our basic laws in there.
t1_ds2pbvj	0	*	Sounds like bad taste, but that's a very relative term nowadays after the president tweeted a gif of him tackling and beating up a news station.
t1_ds3r9ap	0	*	Kurden treten, Christen hauen
t1_ds3ey80	0	*	At least rebuttal. You guys can downvote me but I havent seen how Im wrong. 
t1_ds335tv	0	*	All rulings I saw on this site were public cases, where a person insulted a stranger or even police or military were involved. Exactly what I said.
t1_ds493n6	1	*	Check [xa7 34 StGB](https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stgb/__34.html) - it's actually honor. Dignity is considered separately.
t1_dtf57dk	0	*	I don't feel sorry for the vast majority of people. 
t1_dv0daxp	1	*	Cause hes a fake and shilling around i guess?
t1_du4e1p5	0	*	You do understand that there is a huge difference between the justice system and it's principles and the public opinion, right?
t1_du3h158	1	*	 Please read my previous comments. You're trying to argue with me for no reason.
t1_du4fwdq	0	*	Which is why I explicitly said not to do with this context. He has a point in general, not in this case.
t1_du3i6st	0	*	And we've still executed innocent people.  While a tremendously solid start, the justice system still needs work and will always need to evolve to stay with the times.
t1_du3vhm9	1	*	Not true. Some rape is about power. Some rape is about sexual gratification.
t1_du6ej9f	1	*	You just proved my point. :) Thanks.
t1_du4du17	0	*	That's the standard of the justice system for dishing out punishment. People can think whatever they want without consulting a Jury.
t1_du4j22w	0	*	Technically true. She also has a Master's degree in Special Education from Columbia University.  Woody Allen may be in a relationship with a woman half his age. But he never did anything illegal. 
t1_du3dmjm	0	*	It is completely subjective though.
t1_du3kf2g	0	*	Here's a bit of advice. When you see yourself going down the it's not pedophilia if they are past puberty road, take a knee, wipe your hard drive, and walk back the other way.

t1_dv492iw	0	*	No. They are not.  Whatever, jerk off to your brutal prisons.
t1_dsl5pbq	1	*	I thought the US was pro democracy. Did the Soviets helped overthrow democratically elected governments in Latin America? Nope. 
t1_dskrh8l	1	*	okay but why would he not publish it then. Let the public decide. 
t1_dslau7m	0	*	No, because he would probably commit suicide.   Hes spent his entire life exposing the corruption of governments across the globe. You can't blame the man for not trusting the system.
t1_dsmefl8	0	*	Not me. I read

t1_dsk8j76	0	*	He wasn't interested in my rights he was interested in undermining my country for Putin.
t1_dsk2bl1	0	*	You missed my point, 13 million wasn't spent on providing 24/7 surveillance on Assange but rather to fund other things. 
t1_dsjfacx	0	*	Semantics, I'm done with this conversation.  Shouldn't have commented but was compelled to do so as it reads like tax dollars aren't being used IMO
t1_dtbt4si	0	*	Doesn't matter why.  Try talking around the issue all you want.  The Chinese Communist Party is one of the most murderous, corrupt bunch of monsters in human history.
t1_dtbssrq	1	*	(A) It should be noted that the annexation of Tibet has a lot of parallels with the annexation of Hawaii.   (B) There has not, to my recollection, been any kind of Tibetan genocide. 
t1_dt8de4x	1	*	'Comfortable' is subjective.
t1_dt8jg31	1	*	Who are you to say what is need and what is deserved and what is comfortable?
t1_dt9ttaj	1	*	Its not only that, they are yelling for blood of thirty-thousand-aires

t1_dt8l2jp	1	*	If even half of that is in a house, that averages to 12,000 per year over a 30 year retirement. That is hardly comfortable. 
t1_dt8qa78	1	*	They did it earn it though. That is why they are the 1%.
t1_dtx4brv	1	*	Yeah, America puts economic sanctions on it's friends, right?

t1_du42ry7	1	*	Thank you for elaborating on 3... why that is relevant... is about as relevant as your anecdotal story. Would 4 have been better? Seems to be a common theme around here.
t1_dtw8plo	0	*	We are adversaries. 100%

t1_dtwfrav	1	*	I don't think we really care at this point.   
t1_dtxtrws	1	*	Yeah why would they even care? Not like theyve been flipping out over them for a while now.
t1_dtx4izk	1	*	Not really though.  Watch Dirty Money on Netflix, especially the episode on Mexican Drug Cartels laundering money through US banks.

t1_dv1yte9	0	*	One of the best way to get at truth and maintain a republic is the free, protected exchange of ideas and concepts. Even the uncomfortable and offensive ones. You dont agree. Time will tell. 
t1_dv0mqdq	0	*	Im sorry but the EU doesnt get to decide what free speech is. Its like if the USSR got to decide the definition of property rights, its just retarded logic. 
t1_dv0p8la	1	*	True enough, I lumped that in under politically different
t1_dv0ysa6	0	*	Source: Ted Cruz was never charged

t1_dv1awkz	1	*	I don't know that I need thanks for correcting my errors,  but thank you. 
t1_dv0u9fu	0	*	Freedom of speech is a natural right. Laws that limit it are immoral. Would you of told Jeff Widener (tiannamen square photographer) to have followed the law.
t1_dv16ecy	1	*	They were considered unconstitutional with regards to the Constitution of Oregon. Maybe that's what Cumtopian means.
t1_dv1b8n2	0	*	No it isn't, it is simply adding an extra word to the middle of the two.  And at any rate, neither of those phrases appear in the French constitution because it is written in . . . French!
t1_dv0v7q0	0	*	More like it makes me more aware of the danger of driving a car......

t1_dv1jzen	1	*	Tell me more
t1_dv0tm3a	0	*	You're more or less right. There's a little nuance to this (we don't have absolute freedom of speech), but your basic concept is the right answer to questioning how that subreddit exists.
t1_dv18uyj	0	*	So, when confronted with the accusation that you are just like ISIS, you can't highlight the differences between you and ISIS, because that would be supporting ISIS?  That's absurd.

t1_dv0ujkn	0	*	Yelling fire in a crowded theater is NOT overturned.  It has to do with damages resulting in your (poorly thought out) speech.
t1_dv10rdb	1	*	Hate speech is free speech. Don't spout shit out of your mouth if you can't even get the facts right.
t1_dv0nbmx	0	*	Oh, she posted child porn? Is that what you're saying?  Are you too obtuse or too unwilling to make an argument on the actual subject?
t1_dv0ssh9	0	*	they get pushed into it and have mental health problems, I'm sure they'd rather be rich living it up instead of dead or in prison
t1_dv1nxyc	1	*	They should commit to their standards, their Terms of Service, like Youtube is trying (and failing) to.
t1_dv19r1n	0	*	Well here in Czechia, gays can adopt a child and we have legal medical marijuana.  I am not that knowledgeable about right in other countries, but we are not living in some kind of totalities.  
t1_dv14ros	1	*	Neither do ours. We just have the most media visibility because everyone else has dick envy so its all a game of pretend. 
t1_dv1az1h	0	*	That would only be the case if said image were obtained illegally

t1_dv1plsb	1	*	Oh, just like treating every gun owner as a mass-murderer is also irrational?  You may think they're irrational, but they both prevent murder.
t1_dv1qddk	0	*	Sorry for having a distaste for nationalist rhetoric. Le Pen and her ilk have no place on modern politics. It regressive as fuck. 
t1_dv0l4an	1	*	I hate when people confront a stupid idea! Why cant everyone agree with me!?!
t1_dv0nl6l	1	*	What a civil offense? Sure okay. Anyways, if you're in support of someone possibly facing jail time over this that's crazy. That's all. 
t1_dv0ldho	0	*	She shared the images and videos because people were comparing her and her party to ISIS, so to prove them wrong she showed the truth about ISIS.

t1_dv0njji	0	*	If you have enough unpaid traffic violations you can go to jail at least in the US. I don't know why my comment is being down voted it is a fact.

t1_dv1i4h5	0	*	Hey, I'm not a weirdo...
t1_dv0wl59	0	*	Fire in a theater is the espionage act. This hasn't been overturned. In fact, it's what Edward Snowden was charged for
t1_dv1ilym	0	*	> I'm just expressing my opinion.  You were making a claim about the state of the law.

t1_dv1q07f	0	*	True, but even then if the sex and the post is consensual, somebody's privacy rights aren't violated.    I bet that if revenge pics/vid got posted they would be dealt with very swiftly.  
t1_dv1a3c4	0	*	No, she wouldn't,   Unless it was on charges of funniest tweet of 2018, but i feel like it's only barely March so we should give awards out yet for that
t1_dv1cmyu	1	*	Oh shit you just completely invalidated his point haha great tactic bro 
t1_dv0t8ki	1	*	I'm serious. Theres no good definition of whats obscene but there is an invisible line somewhere.
t1_dv1kty7	0	*	First thing a dictator does is make sure that the military is on his side. Who do you think is fighting for Assad?
t1_dv1ojl9	0	*	They literally said that freedom of speech wasn't a thing in France. Which is a blatant lie.
t1_dv0rjvw	0	*	You could also have responded with a 'proof?' message of some sorts. By your logic every response should be deemed fine.
t1_dv0smdo	1	*	I laughed pretty hard at this.
t1_dv16zgn	0	*	She was trying to express a point. She used something extreme to make that point.
t1_dv0oen7	1	*	Maybe it wouldn't happen so much if so many people didn't resort to whataboutism.
t1_dv0mfjn	0	*	Yea, it's just waaaaaaaaaay more limited in France as opposed to America. Way more. 
t1_dv0we4i	0	*	>Even in a country like the USA, free speech does not mean that you cannot shout 'fire' in a crowded theatre.  it literally does tho. Look up that case.

t1_dv0m0gr	0	*	Yes, but driving is a privilege. Free speech should be a right. 
t1_dv2h012	0	*	If they hate those images, then maybe they shouldn't commit those acts, would posting images of the holocaust incite violence against Germans?
t1_dv103hr	0	*	I'm sorry, I wasn't aware that we were discussing four year olds in particular.  Because we weren't.  Censorship in general is stupid.
t1_dv0p3f7	0	*	So if a news report posts videos of a terrorist attack should they be charged?  Same logic.
t1_dv1vllt	0	*	Hyperbolic maybe?
t1_dv0x89u	1	*	Child porn is almost universally illegal. You see dead bodies in the media all the time.
t1_dv0ykyw	1	*	It had? He still has a lot of subscribers, Youtube did nothing to him, and he launched another video of him electrocuting a rat.
t1_dv1kun7	1	*	Wow, way to frame the issue. This isn't about whether or not aiding ISIS is bad, it's about free speech protections. Probably not good to assume that everyone who disagrees with you is a bot.
t1_dv0mp4k	0	*	In what way would it not be? She's being charged for posting videos of real things that are happening.  Would you prefer to shut your eyes and let ISIS run people over in peace?
t1_dv0mmux	0	*	1789 is also when the American Bill of rights was written. There is no who thought of it first as far as I can see. 
t1_dv0p9tt	0	*	That sounds profound but it's just wrong.
t1_dv0swb3	1	*	Yea, someone should have told those pesky Vietnamese and Middle Eastern farmers that they were supposed to lose those wars.    Get a grip.
t1_dv0kmt7	1	*	Your point being?
t1_dv12knl	0	*	What about how Australia is contravening UN refugee policy by interning migrants on an island off Borneo indefinitely?? What about it? Nothing because its fucking irrelevant. 
t1_dv1l5jy	0	*	Man. as an an american being criminally charged for being disrespectful is strange. 
t1_dv1k5jl	0	*	The justice system? the same system that places limitations on free speech in the US as well. 
t1_dv0xlu2	0	*	Except they experienced channel growth after that, and only upon another screwup did they actually suffer repercussions of severity.

t1_dv1d3dy	1	*	>broadcasting terrorist propaganda is legal  Here I thought she was doing the exact opposite, showing their horrible acts for what they are.
t1_dv1rpkx	1	*	Oh I'm a lawyer and I broke a commonly understood and recognised law  It can't be because I broke the law! It's because of oppression! 
t1_dv2ir5z	1	*	Its not for the state to decide which ideas are acceptable. You might like which ideas are restricted now. Will you in fifty years?
t1_dv0xcj5	0	*	There is lots of stuff I would not let on my Facebook. I am just stating its a real world problem. By singling her out like this its only going to politiclaly help her.

t1_dtupg2g	0	*	You guys using the word we to refer to space x but not for NASA is confusing the shit out of me. 
t1_dtvozk5	1	*	There's nothing to obscure or distort light. No haze, clouds, water, nothing. Just pure and intense sunlight beaming directly onto an object.
t1_dtvavkq	1	*	Yeah, but what if the camera breaks or gets wet? It's too risky. 
t1_dtuobfz	0	*	Yeah, and now because of your hero, America will become a 3rd world shithole as well! Praise Musk!

t1_dtuspu0	1	*	Naw
t1_dtwbcyb	1	*	You mean like the phone, internet/streaming, and rocket flight? Those are all mind blowing and didn't exist 100 years ago. Cars did, but people would have no idea how to get a car into space...

t1_dshu67p	0	*	You sound almost disappointed... 
t1_dshzmt3	0	*	Yeah, it actually kinda does. Just treat people with equal kindness and stop treating them different because of their skin color.
t1_dshn1jy	1	*	Saying one does not like what Russia is doing is not a fucking endorsement for what the US does. Quit being so purposely obtuse.
t1_dshrpp7	1	*	Screw it, forget the whole thong
t1_dshp6v5	1	*	That is certainly possible.
t1_dsi47d9	1	*	That is the correct answer. The question doesn't really matter either, red pandas are always the correct answer.
t1_dsi2rb9	0	*	So are Brits not allowed to discuss the negatives of imperialism because their country used to do it decades before? 
t1_dsikx1s	1	*	Classic tactic.

t1_dshyfy4	0	*	Nah, theyll still need the masses to buy the shit they peddle. 
t1_dshtx6m	0	*	If you think that it's only about shaming countries, you're missing the point. The point is how can we and our allies protect against these sorts of attacks in the future.
t1_dshwnvo	1	*	Sounds like Argentina U0001f641
t1_dshknbg	0	*	depends who they were. and there is no criminal liability in this scenario so its not 1 to 1. maybe wait a bit before impeaching POTUS?
t1_dsi1n2q	1	*	Isn't democracy great?
t1_dsi6jh6	1	*	There is nothing in this article that suggests election meddling. It's describing the military and diplomatic action that the US took (very publicly) in Libya.
t1_dsiec25	0	*	But that wasn't my point tho. Of course there's propaganda on FJ, that's definitely not the hill I wanna die on, but it has nothing to do with Russia, at least I don't think it does. 
t1_dshveeq	0	*	Not ANY country. Some countries are fortunate enough to have good governments.
t1_dshvss4	0	*	I think more people buy into the puffery than you generously suggest.

t1_dsi2a9r	1	*	lol
t1_dsiyhbm	1	*	Thanks for the giggle. 
t1_dshx5pn	1	*	I think he is, though. Pointing out the hypocrisy of the US is an attempt at discrediting the underlying Russia meddling.  But I guess we're going around in circles here. 
t1_dshp3or	0	*	He's being disingenuous and willfully oblivious/trying to downplay it all. It's not worth engaging him. 
t1_dshsyf0	0	*	I know. I was supposed to say In fact, forget the country. I chose differently. 
t1_dshpaq2	0	*	It's a good thing Russia never invaded Afghanistan. That would just make your argument silly. 
t1_dsieoqz	1	*	He rode on the back of a resources boom and the West being distracted by a middle east quagmire.  Without Putin it would likely be much better if reformed.

t1_dsi9g5c	0	*	Central or Northern Europe
t1_dsjenw3	1	*	But it is a witch hunt. Regardless what comes out of it in the end its a great thing for the media to keep your focus on such an unimportant topic. 
t1_dsoolxk	1	*	Exactly
t1_dsi0p17	0	*	His Einstein's name?  Albert Brother. 
t1_dshyp60	1	*	Ah yes, I think I recall.

t1_dshs6rg	0	*	Creating a system which rewards bribing regulators so you end up with a police state and no market innovations?
t1_dsht4eq	1	*	True, there should probably be a different term than neo-Nazi for such groups in that region. But, regardless, it's definitely an issue in Russia, sadly one that Putin is all too happy to encourage. 
t1_dshs2yj	0	*	> Using whataboutism to justify anything is ridiculous.  My point exactly.

t1_dshzfp4	1	*	So show me the type of capitalism that isn't exploitative.

t1_dtjo0s5	0	*	Here's the thing.  There is no justification for the slaughter of children.  You can call them enemies of Israel and twist and squirm the arguments but you really need to stop.
t1_dt9qs4p	0	*	You sound like one of those conspiracy nutters. I suggest you take a step back and reevaluate your stance. Hopefully you'll realize the stupidity of your suggestions. 
t1_dta1imw	1	*	With such a promising premise.  And an epic poster.
t1_dv22cy8	0	*	Starting a business isn't a spontaneous thing.
t1_dse8w51	1	*	Actually, it is completely relevant as those comets must have bordered on the size oh a planet themselves in order to destroy a planet but, as I stated, this is obviously well over you IQ level.. 
t1_dsdwzrc	1	*	Still waiting...
t1_dse7it1	1	*	Actually, shithead, the subject of this comment of yours was rogue planets which those peer reviewed articles directly address which you conviently sweep under the rug because the logic escapes you. 
t1_dsa5uwf	1	*	So Germany is becoming a police state according to your definition, since they have enabled NetzDG now.
t1_ds99so3	1	*	Likewise it's pretty widely known that Eastern Europe is sick of the EU, so much so that I'm surprised that a blog source is needed.

t1_dss2ywi	0	*	> So do you think we shouldn't believe Sam Harris that Islamic faith is a factor in terrorism?  That depends, do you think that what you believe influences your actions or not?
t1_dssf5t7	1	*	No it still does count as suicide afaik. Just because you think you're doing the right thing doesn't mean you're doing the right thing. 
t1_dsseohm	1	*	Lmao Sam Harris ooof buddy get a better ideologue, at least Sargon is consistent 
t1_dsron99	1	*	Also true. Do moderate Imams getting murdered get reported very often? The only people who try to kill them here are white guys too stupid to realize who the extremist ones are.
t1_dssdf8j	1	*	Like u/hamakabi said, establishing this as a norm now makes future brainwashing more difficult.   A vaccine doesn't cure anybody, but prevents future infection.

t1_du441u0	0	*	Then how come so many of them risk their lives to escape Cuba? If things are so great there, you'd expect people would be trying to sneak into Cuba instead of out of it.

t1_du4famo	0	*	Do you know that first hand or is that what you learned in school? Serious question. Wondering where that comes from.
t1_du4arcj	1	*	This whole argument falls apart when you realize that the media covered PR and all of the mishaps in its recovery and has continued to give updates like this one.

t1_du4aw34	1	*	If that washing away could include Gulfport, Mississippi I'd be very happy.  
t1_du418tz	0	*	It's a co-op, but from the perspective of the federal government it's an entity that they have no control over.

t1_du4e36k	1	*	Update: Thankfully, power came back on within the half hour
t1_du4hwhz	1	*	That of course, needs to be installed correctly and be done incredibly carefully -- otherwise you end up exploding things when doing a grid reconnection without proper synchronization.

t1_du46nvl	0	*	No, they didn't.
t1_du5kmbi	1	*	In Spanish, we have a word for people from the US (estadounidenses, which comes from Estados Unidos). As there is not a translation for that, I use American to refer to mainland people.

t1_du4a4ag	0	*	Touchxe9. Is Kansas trying to get away with it or do they have good tornado-proof infrastructure?
t1_du4v2iz	0	*	It means Californians paid a lot less in federal taxes than Americans from states with 0-6% state income taxes.    It's not a difficult concept to understand.
t1_du4xc23	0	*	Right, the rich home owners will pay higher real estate taxes but they'd be the same people getting free pipes.    $ocial Democrat fail!

t1_du5t6wp	1	*	lol! I've lived in several other countries and traveled all over the world, including to Puerto Rico. The third world countries I went to were safer than there.

t1_dumvuu5	1	*	Where is this 4 guys thing coming from?

t1_du33hd3	0	*	Careful, explaining the truth will get you down voted quick.
t1_du553ae	1	*	I agree that it's not ideal. The idea of relieving a people of a portion of their sovereignty by ramming it through and down their throats doesn't have great optics.

t1_du4fo7g	0	*	Lol please. I've heard people moaning because some companies have russian _investors_.

t1_duhzomu	0	*	The church did have something to do with the renaissance, it made it more difficult.
t1_dul83j4	0	*	Its pretty consequential to this article though.  Id say the definition over Jesus is why this Christian wont accept Muslims.

t1_duhq7tj	1	*	Good point, galileo is a bad example
t1_duhzamw	0	*	I didnt say it was 'as bad', just that its not the answer the islamification of Europe. Claiming HIV isnt as bad as cancer isnt an endorsement of HIV either.
t1_ds4w3ke	0	*	True, but it isn't the root of peace and freedom as well.
t1_ds50l5v	0	*	The intercept its the best IMHO.
t1_ds4vyeo	0	*	> It seems like were going down this road again, and its never ended well.  Sometimes you need to break a few eggs to get a better standard of living.
t1_ds4qeqq	1	*	Nah, they were targeting the geography...

t1_ds51e38	1	*	He had a Scotsman to thank for not dying during that Revolution.
t1_ds4ql63	1	*	Because the American gvt hasn't been caught lying. The emotional reactions to Putin's comment is hilarious

t1_ds56qln	1	*	Relevant username
t1_ds5rqb0	0	*	Sure, I can understand that, and that's why I do believe that the two-state plan is the solution. It's just that the Israel caused so much chaos statement I answered to is quite faulty and one-sided.
t1_ds4qzd6	0	*	An estimated ~1.7 million died in gulags. There is no comparison to be made whatsoever. 
t1_ds4v8it	0	*	Not following.

t1_ds4po1k	1	*	The result is not the same. Clearly people dying is worse.
t1_ds4v752	0	*	Nope, it's not okay. But it's not on the same level as what Russia has done recently. That's the point, dipshit.
t1_ds4s8z4	1	*	Yup. It's on purpose with these regimes.  Same thing with Best Korea and his brother 
t1_ds5ghbd	1	*	Again, not trying to make any claims on who is from where or which argument is more valid. Just that Hogun555 was pointing out the hypocrisy from the american bias on reddit.
t1_ds50c5q	0	*	Not serving in the military isnt a negative or a positive. Nor is serving in the military an automatic positive.

t1_ds7ruci	1	*	Also, feel free to look up the history of Hawaii or any Native American nation. 
t1_ds4wbxd	1	*	Yes, because the FBI has never in it's whole history done anything sketchy and wasn't formed specifically to deal with freaky shit like communists and protests and everything.

t1_ds4u8a7	1	*	I don't disagree at all. I'm just saying enough with the hyperbole claiming it was a genocide. It's ridiculous. It's disrespectful to the victims of actual genocide. 
t1_ds5emzb	0	*	What Russia did wasn't any worse.
t1_ds4xe7x	1	*	Which never happened in North America because North Americans don't work hard or in cold conditions?

t1_ds4pu5d	0	*	Go away Putin. You're drunk.
t1_ds4t34z	0	*	I would say the problem is that it hampers public discourse about reaching a solution to a human rights or geopolitical problem  ... in both directions  Do I get a sticker?
t1_ds4w5gr	0	*	We're in a post about Iran. Quit pretending in this context, Russia talking about US undermining of protests is unrelated to Iran undermining protests. 
t1_ds4x9oa	1	*	I understand what you're getting at, but it's not my place to suggest alternatives. I leave that to the people whose job it is, I'm just a tutor.

t1_ds4w7lo	0	*	What was the thing? 
t1_ds5xn5x	0	*	Yup. You know the news never was interested in his viewpoint, right? Because they are servants of power.
t1_ds4slqh	0	*	Why should anyone be neutral about Trump?
t1_ds54dmc	0	*	So it was a case of inflation depleting their reserves, and the falling price of grain depleting the value (in machinery terms) of the commodity they were selling?

t1_ds4rj24	0	*	Do you have a link to that footage? Because as far as I can see its only the Ferguson cops word. A guy who has admitted to using the N-word to refer to blacks. 
t1_ds5203y	0	*	Was she? Shit, my bad.
t1_ds57tce	1	*	Don't worry, I was being sarcastic. I'm a democratic socialist myself, and I'm fully aware of the differences between the various schools of thought within socialism.

t1_dshgvpm	1	*	lol alright i said i agree with you. you win
t1_dsy83on	1	*	edit because (:
t1_dt2kvhw	0	*	> I will enunciate your ignorance and hypocrisy.  Don't hurt yourself. Did you just pull random words out of your ass in the hope that they might make sense? They don't by the way.  
t1_dsxkegq	0	*	Probably because you grouped rich people together into a category of assholes made it seem like they had a persona vendetta against everyone. 
t1_dsxurhf	0	*	The sales tax is actually paid by the company to the government. The sales tax they collect from you is the company's money until they pay their taxes.
t1_dsxxhu5	0	*	I'm sorry that your view of Capitalism has been soured because of a few examples. What alternative do you prefer?
t1_dsxwk4y	1	*	It's difficult to argue against subjective speculation.  At the same time, you have convinced everyone that we're being fucked 
t1_dtwjelm	1	*	I think I understand what you're saying. And tbh, what really matters is the interest charged
t1_dsv3hij	0	*	And? is that proof that free healthcare and education always increases overall economic wealth? you know that not every country functions the same right?

t1_dv6yczj	0	*	Today the us is drone bombing heaps of countries and is occupying Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria currently. How is Russia or china worse in terms of warring?
t1_dv49kxp	1	*	Oh you're right. EU placed financial sanctions after the Ukraine invasion and Russia responded by sanctioning food imports.
t1_du0u252	1	*	The article itself refers to multiple gas attacks throughout Syria since the beginning of the war, not one specific attack. 
t1_dtwpp6e	0	*	my point is, you try to come across as a liberal American when deep down you are just another colonialist, another American hegemony supporter.

t1_ds3ez2n	1	*	It also happened to be green and yellow.
t1_ds3rf3k	0	*	Wow, interesting.  I guess part of this you could put down to Australians being more aware of wildlife danger. But still, it goes to show that wolves, bears and cougars are fucking scary.
t1_ds4w55x	1	*	Well... I mean, but you remove the dangerous ones, right? Non aggression is cool and spiders are great but I draw the line at black widows and brown recluses

t1_dsbd5hj	1	*	I was a little worried you might have seen that to be honest, you sound very smart.
t1_dsbwsrj	0	*	I actually do donate to charity, thanks. Also a conservative here, but I don't let my side politics influence ethics.   If it baffles you, I don't really think we can continue this discussion.

t1_dsb77zn	0	*	What about being anti-ILLEGAL immigration? 
t1_dsg5w9v	0	*	I dont care about those numbers. What matters is he amount here and that they are coming across. 
t1_dsb3asv	0	*	can you give me some examples?  i feel like i missed the memo.  i find it hard to believe that obama tweaked it enough, right before he left, that suddenly reddit would approve of it.  
t1_dsazppo	0	*	Lol. Ok, in the meantime however we probably shouldn't have an illegal underclass willing to work for much less than their American counterparts. 
t1_dsazfqc	1	*	As much as I don't like Rumsfeld, he was right when he said it.
t1_dsb1thi	1	*	I don't live in a country who voted for Trump. Fox News lie. Fox is not a news source and could be shut down for pretending to be one. It should be shut down. Trump you for defending them. 
t1_dsb4eio	0	*	Im in Georgia, youve summed it up perfectly. What do you say to people that have been brainwashed into thinking YOURE brainwashed?

t1_dsb1rtk	1	*	Oh I agree by the way. I think that is what makes this so complicated. It's like HOW we react or something. Or how some left leaning people react.
t1_dscdpq7	1	*	No shit Sherlock, I never implied otherwise.  Trump was the least popular candidate in the 2016 Election, and the majority of Americans continue to disapprove of him. #factsfirst #realnews
t1_dsbexo9	0	*	Yup, and a rhetorical question is usually posed to make a point. And what point are you trying to make? That there's nothing in Mexico worth visiting? 
t1_dsb2ts3	0	*	You're saying she cheated, she just didn't cheat hard enough to win, right? Also, you have sources on that?
t1_dsb113x	0	*	they somehow developed nuclear weapons while under the strictest sanctions known to man

t1_dsb0cz9	1	*	It could be a 5 foot gap for all I care. If it disrupts the wall its done its job.
t1_dsb4hz1	0	*	Yes, but theres always going to be more people in urban areas (across most states and the entire country) than people in rural areas, and urban areas tend to go blue and rural areas tend to go red.

t1_dsb51p3	0	*	Who said anything about a flight? You know cars exist, right? I cant tell if youre trolling or retarded. 
t1_dsb7w26	0	*	Trump might be the best possible president for economists, because they might get to see the real effects of implementing crazy extreme tax policies. It could start a whole new branch of economics!
t1_dsaxiru	0	*	Yes, but that obviously isn't a problem for the American people because he won. 
t1_dsb00v2	1	*	I didn't downvote you lol, downvoting this comment for crying about being downvoted by others
t1_dsbj316	1	*	I mean, he just called a prime minister mamaboy. What is he, 12? 
t1_dsb1tyw	0	*	Honest question, if you happen to know:  Do states with high state taxes tend to take less in Federal dollars than states that  have no income tax, etc.?  I've always wondered that.

t1_dsb0kh2	1	*	My point exactly. Especially when the parent knows they cannot care for the child. 
t1_dsba3ss	0	*	Is Mexico not importing mass amounts of meth into the US? How does a barrier and increased security apparatus not make it harder for them to sell their drugs in the US in the first place? 
t1_dsb2b0h	0	*	Lying isn't free speech. You only believe that because you watch Fox News. Lying is harming people (legally). 
t1_dsb1qvv	0	*	I think he was talking about the 2016 hostage incident not the 1980s ones. You know the one that happened days before the iran deal was solidified?

t1_dtxay8f	0	*	Love the fact that your go to is New Zealand and not Australia, Canada...actually the whole of the Americas. Europeans were sure to destroy the native cultures.

t1_dtxfy56	1	*	Well I think it also depends on what your criteria for best is 
t1_dtxkq9p	0	*	No, what I have used is the proper grammar.  Needful is what people are doing, who are still trying to emigrate.  Those that are already here, we have done our mental gymnastics already.

t1_dtxfka8	0	*	> Estonia   A really lovely country by the way you might want to pick another example. 
t1_dty0fc0	1	*	It wasnt great for the middle class. Many polish were skilled immigrants willing to work for lower wages in industries like IT which drove down wages.

t1_dty26bl	0	*	A very large percentage of the Australian population is either British migrants or descended from British migrants.
t1_dtxjtdc	0	*	That's an awful long game though. It takes like a decade to go from crossing the border to being able to vote.
t1_dtxe3vl	0	*	The xenophobia is definitely not overstated. The cultural difference which is used to justify the xenophobia is overstated. The xenophobia itself is very real.

t1_dtxei8h	1	*	Still not getting your point. 6% of Australia is still more than 25% of the UK. Australia is 31 times larger the UK, 7.6 million square km vs 242,000 square km.

t1_dsx2vvf	0	*	Yeah but I was part of its creation so I need to have a say in whether it dies or not.
t1_dsz9ifz	0	*	You may be joking but that's the wait list for getting a child, not how long a child has to wait. They are still newborns when they are adopted.
t1_dswl5ed	0	*	Can you show me where this right to an abortion is? Its definitely not in the charter, and the SCC never actually banned all restrictions on abortion
t1_dswmkfm	0	*	Is this the same sort of slippery slope logic that could make masturbation by men a crime?
t1_dswlmq1	1	*	Is there evidence that fetus's are sentient when they're conceived? 
t1_dswllf1	0	*	But you can't do so without removing the woman's bodily autonomy. Which is again a downgrade in human rights. 
t1_dswn1o8	0	*	Fuckin' rights bud! Go getch'er sled and let's go fer a rip!   Hey can I bum a dart though, I'm out.
t1_dsxpe43	0	*	In your own words, you are willing to let some babies be murdered.  
t1_dsxk09t	1	*	Lol yeah that's about the quality of the retorts that I get.
t1_dswm5sp	0	*	Is that an opinion or a fact?  Do you know the difference?    Go kneel to your sky fairy. 
t1_dswx2w6	0	*	It isn't the opinion, it's the action.
t1_dswni8m	0	*	Im sure it does, because you whole heartedly agree with the governments aim this time. But if this was Harper taking away funding from lgtbq groups, youd think we were in a civil war.
t1_dswphwk	0	*	Also, slippery slope. At what point is it human enough to not murder? 
t1_dswn6db	0	*	I'm not from Canada but I'm asking because I'd like to know, how does being personally opposed to abortion violate anything in the Charter?
t1_dswmt87	0	*	Can you tell me when a baby is a human then? No one seems to be able to actually answer this. 
t1_dsx6qhy	0	*	Does that make it right though?
t1_dswpd1b	0	*	Nah, it's fine. Anti-abortion groups are against women having the right to choose if they want a baby to continue growing inside them. They're scum. 
t1_dswpkw3	0	*	So? Unfertilized, can't become human
t1_dsy6gre	1	*	Thank you.  I'm very sure that I was explicit, but god damnes the human race will read whst they want.
t1_dswpyy0	0	*	No, I didn't. I said your opinion on what a woman gets to to with her body is irrelevant.
t1_dsyr5mc	1	*	Yes, but it doesn't say the core mandate has to explicitly mention it.
t1_dsx8ei3	0	*	They aren't, but almost every anti abortion person I've encountered has used theological arguments for fetal personhood.
t1_dswmum7	0	*	Wow that's pretty extreme. Calm down Satan 
t1_dswrwpg	1	*	Im glad to hear that. 
t1_dswvxwj	0	*	Yes   It'd be an interesting event to see her try and use her power  but she does /technically/ have it.
t1_dsyhn16	1	*	> government does give some of them funding.   Please list some anti-gun groups that get government funding. 
t1_dswxpdw	0	*	Late to the party, but, yeah, your point is simply wrong. This isn't about beliefs it's about human rights.
t1_dswrrg9	1	*	YOU FIRST
t1_dswphdk	0	*	I did not equate it to a human. I said it will BECOME a human, which is undeniably true
t1_dsy3uwt	0	*	It's a non sequitur because what you argued and the proof you supplied doesn't have any relevance to each other.   
t1_dswpgjq	0	*	Right. People make mistakes, but not ones that should be erased by killing a fetus
t1_dswucn2	0	*	A clump of cells is not a body.   Thats like saying the eggs women drop with each period have rights. Or semen does. U0001f644U0001f612
t1_dswrisu	0	*	That is the crux of the matter. At that point it becomes a philosophical debate and not a scientific one. And it's a debate I really don't feel like partaking in at the moment.
t1_dswq325	0	*	Are you even Canadian? The Trudeau government can fund whatever they want. I don't want for example the KKK to receive government funding, and I don't want anti abortion groups to receive funding.  
t1_dswlcmd	0	*	Tomorrow and Tomorrow and tomorrow,   creeps in this petty pace from day to day,  To the last syllable of recorded time;  and all our yesterdays have lighted fools  The way to dusty death.  
t1_dsxck7q	0	*	You are ignorant of how anti discrimination laws,  or any laws, work in Canada, but I don't really feel like giving an American a Canadian Law 101
t1_dswm8im	0	*	Just because its legally not a person doesnt mean that it isnt a person. 
t1_dsxxfrp	1	*	And what does it do?
t1_dswf3n1	0	*	discrimination against discriminatory groups is the real discrimination 
t1_dswnrv6	0	*	Care to present a single political position you hold that isn't ultimately based on a feeling or belief?  Seriously, just one. I've never come across one, I'd be interested to see what it looks like.
t1_dswodhf	0	*	I don't know if you're being sarcastic or not but it will be a cold day in hell before it will come around again and it's not an error so I have no worries at all about it.

t1_dsyjr7a	0	*	Why would you abort a baby from in vitro? 
t1_dswl3wo	0	*	Probably not the best example, many of those voters do actually live in multi-cultural neighborhoods in cities and outlying burbs.
t1_dsx43fe	0	*	Dude.. your math does not add up. 
t1_dswinxw	0	*	>Advocating against abortion is not a violation of reproductive rights,  Nobody said it was.
t1_dswkc25	1	*	Kinda. And a third group would say there is no infant until 3 months
t1_dswrk6f	0	*	Suppose it was the day before the 20th week  Would that be acceptable?  
t1_dswnd4m	0	*	Not only that. But if you have to ask about him being a sociopath, you either have no clue what Harper was or perhaps you're a conservative and he was a hero to you.
t1_dsxxfpx	1	*	No, they flip flop from complementing to shitting on people.  Politics has nothing but bile for one race entirely, no matter what, while flip flopping on every other if they align with their politics.
t1_dswobjg	0	*	Yeah, that's what the Liberals thought before they lost their position as offical opposition to the NDP last cycle. 
t1_dswoljp	0	*	Same as giddy
t1_dsxq1ri	0	*	Wasn't trying to refute :) Just stating your comment is hilarious (because it's so fucking stupid). 'Pro-abortion' groups hahahaha, man in what world do you live? Hahaha!
t1_dsx0nme	1	*	>But if she paid someone to kill her **unborn baby**, she's just exercising her rights. 
t1_dswq0ko	0	*	I mean if your definition of human is has human DNA in it, then i guess my nail clippings are human too.
t1_dswv86g	0	*	In straya the Governor General is appointed by the Queen acting on the advice of the Prime Minister.   Dunno how its done in Canada but thats how we do it here. 
t1_dswqdsg	0	*	False. American prisoners are not bought and sold as property. That doesn't make the system good, but it does make it not chattel slavery.
t1_dswsiq5	1	*	> If I told you specifics, you would not believe me  Try me. I'm curious.
t1_dswowu1	0	*	>It's the ~~Democrats~~ Republicans throwing a tantrum over DACA and threatening a shutdown that is putting CHIP in jeopardy.
t1_dswo5ip	0	*	To respect the governments position it is necessary to believe it.
t1_dswu0jr	1	*	Any chance you could pm me a joke/tale he definitely didn't tell you that reflected his definitely not dark humour?
t1_dswqmjw	1	*	What?   > If you can keep your beliefs separate from your business then you are fine!  That's exactly what I'm arguing. You seem confused.
t1_dsy383x	0	*	Thank you. All valid examples.  However, my initial point was that religious beliefs/morals are irrelevant to non-religious people. Can you really argue that?
t1_dswjw42	0	*	You dont seem to understand the difference between advocating *for* rights and advocating *against* them. 
t1_dswlb59	0	*	I know I did
t1_dswq85g	0	*	Strawman. There is no such case where that happens.
t1_dswnxp3	0	*	> Even Jack Layton whos as beloved as they come has a few stories of being an asshole privately  this is 100% news to me.
t1_dswyuyw	1	*	Yeah youre right from a British perspective but not a Dominion perspective
t1_dswwvgu	0	*	Are you pro-death penalty as well?
t1_dsx0dfb	1	*	Yeah, except this isnt one of those countries.  Nice strawman though!
t1_dswmh43	0	*	So if someone yells your name or shoves you when you're asleep, you stay asleep because you don't have the power of perception through your senses? 
t1_dswkjc3	0	*	What the hell are you on about?  Are you replying to the wrong person?  I didn't get anywhere close to what you are ranting about.  Are you ok?
t1_dswrolx	1	*	Maybe so but it seems like quite a dangerous and expensive route as opposed to, you know, not giving all poor people vasectomies.
t1_dswp4vr	0	*	Then she doesn't get funding? 
t1_dswmfs6	1	*	What the fuck!
t1_dswvvmf	1	*	In Spanish ready and clever can be the same word and I can't find the reason why. That shit is not unique to English.
t1_dswxlbh	0	*	An fetus is a result of a foreign body entering the host.  
t1_dsx5f7u	0	*	They are and it's being upvoted.  Welcome to the new age of morality.
t1_dswor7q	0	*	That's the issue: we're treating lives as material banal things like money. They're not. One life today and one life 1000 years ago is still one life
t1_dswmqn3	0	*	I dont want any religious group getting tax grants, sorry
t1_dsx7rwn	1	*	Except that's not an extreme outlier
t1_dswlapr	1	*	Has he ever went a day without Botox?
t1_dswqq3t	1	*	Well if that were the case, then it's great. The entire problem is that many times pregnant women have the realistic option for neither.
t1_dsx9tp6	1	*	Just thinking about it critically, you could try and read the study.
t1_dswrgvs	1	*	U0001f4af
t1_dszsp4b	1	*	You have made the assumption that by all hashed out I meant in support of my statement. That's not the case. 
t1_dswosxh	1	*	No kidding. This is part of what makes me consider him a sociopath. (a small, but significant part)
t1_dswpo2t	1	*	No?
t1_dswodjv	0	*	I don't understand what you are asking, please reword it. Being forced to spend any of your time or body on other people is reprehensible and unacceptable. 
t1_dsxhyit	1	*	I would also argue consciousness happens around the start of the third trimester or earlier, am not doctor tho
t1_dswnq6f	1	*	> semantics  what do the jews have to do with it?
t1_dswqkys	0	*	First or second trimester, but not the third trimester. Also, fetuses are not babies.
t1_dswpuio	1	*	Can the law never change then? 
t1_dsxphx4	0	*	Yes, the cautious choice is not taking away someone's (expectant mothers) rights based on something you can't prove.
t1_dswpezy	0	*	Hilarious. I made a spelling error. Now respond with an actual argument please
t1_dswkl4r	0	*	There is no life, only a fetus and that fetus has no legal rights. The only person with rights is the pregnant woman who gets to decide what goes on inside her body. 
t1_dswog9t	0	*	To state it briefly: the various impacts to the life of the mother, all of which are circumstantial.  I could list them if you want but I'm sure you're familiar.
t1_dszc1br	0	*	Abide by the political opinion of the state or the state will not fund you. How is that position not oppression?
t1_dsx6wpw	0	*	Yea I think that's a gross misrepresentation and generalization of prolife people. How do you justify your statement? How do they stop caring about the individual? 
t1_dswubz8	1	*	All languages have weird bullshit, but some have weirder bullshit than others. I might be biased because English is not my native language, but idioms in English more often seem totally random.
t1_dswlcti	1	*	mom = slave owner is where I would have maybe thought to myself this analogy isn't going to hold up
t1_dswoqxc	1	*	...what? 
t1_dsxf4nr	1	*	Idk if they had the most experienced or simply the most. IMO it was mostly a lack of charisma and too much splitting of the ballot.
t1_dsx1ksf	1	*	Yeah literally no one thinks like this.
t1_dswnp37	0	*	Is having a pamphlet on a counter a crusade?  If you're paranoid or just overly sensetive, all dissent is part of some crusade against you.
t1_dswp4kp	0	*	I mean, if banning murder made it happen more, you might have a point.  You still haven't told me why you want more abortions and higher rates of maternal mortality? 
t1_dswnsyc	1	*	I'm sure everyone has at least a couple of stories about being an asshole, but Layton was a far cry from elitist.   
t1_dsxpecf	1	*	[Sure ya did](https://media2.giphy.com/media/EouEzI5bBR8uk/giphy.gif)
t1_dswycnn	1	*	Considering you can phone in your vote and the mandatory on site presence is ridiculously low, Id be surprise if the lateness rule was strict. (Talking about the Canadian senate)
t1_dswtnf4	1	*	Then let him incubate it. No person can be compelled to hold something within or on their bodythat is the whole point.
t1_dsx7mgb	0	*	I'm pretty sure the mother hen does
t1_dswpj8l	0	*	That's a disgusting view on potential human life.
t1_dsx92bn	0	*	At what point a fetus becomes human is the ultimate question in this debate, is it not?
t1_dswmasu	1	*	Always happy to educate our bigger, slower brother to the south. 
t1_dswskxc	0	*	Both are completely unscientific suppositions. One is just less commonly held to be true.  **Edit:** also, that isn't what a straw man is. 
t1_dswqni9	0	*	First or second trimester is acceptable. 9 months is still a strawman. Also, fetuses are not children. 
t1_dsx5m71	1	*	Huh, neat TIL.
t1_dswslka	0	*	If your life didn't begin, then you've never had a life to be taken away.

t1_dswneby	0	*	And you would be a bigot if you advocated for marijuana legalization, correct?
t1_dsws0nu	0	*	And is there any sort of movement advocating killing toddlers or the unconscious? Do you actually believe that's the next step?
t1_dsxgf9c	0	*	Oh, I personally don't know if it would be a case of self-defense, I was just asking since I feel that's a defense that people could possibly use.
t1_dswqw7u	1	*	Was his point that he should be the arbiter of fetal life?

t1_dswlef1	1	*	If Republicans cared they wouldn't actually shut it down?
t1_dswsr4f	1	*	Ok right... So the condom breaks, and so the woman takes a morning after pill as a precaution. Hungrycloud thinks they should get a life sentence for murder.  Am I correct?
t1_dsx44du	1	*	>  So there is a large amount of racially, (thus cultural) homogenity  Yikes

t1_dswrp7f	1	*	As a pro lifer. I agree 100%
t1_dsy85bp	0	*	Prolife at all cost? Even in case of rape? Even if a pregnancy would endanger the mother? 
t1_dsww2r9	1	*	Welfare is a 4 letter word in US politics though. 
t1_dswpxjs	0	*	Guess laws can never change then.
t1_dswq4cw	0	*	Do you take autonomy from the dead because they don't have a functioning brain? If so, what is your opinion on fetal development and cognition's role in determining personhood?
t1_dsy2vap	0	*	So as long as their only suppressing views you oppose its all good? I cant see that coming back to bite you.
t1_dsxhe1r	0	*	Sometimes the group consensus is wrong, and sometimes the norm changes. Civil rights is constantly evolving.

t1_dswy26u	1	*	/r/thatHappened
t1_dsx27tc	1	*	Isn't the Crown different from the actual people who wear it? I.e. proceeding against the Crown is proceeding against the government (like how we have suits against the United States).
t1_dswqbol	1	*	Oh I didnt read what you were replying to, so I thought you were supporting abortion and seeing a difference in the two.   So in that case I 100% agree with you. 
t1_dsx6hjl	0	*	Yes. This does happen and is exactly what you are supporting. 
t1_dsxaito	0	*	What they call pro-life, I call anti-choice.
t1_dswp9p9	0	*	Yeah so if most don't, why are they getting cut funding for summer jobs? Literally the point of this post...
t1_dswn3zk	1	*	Way to jump to conclusions there 
t1_dsxanbm	1	*	So you think murdering an innocent fetus is morally justified because of things out of its control? Pretty wicked. 
t1_dsxovts	0	*	That majority opinion is pro life?  I just assumed it is, why does it matter?
t1_dsx1xih	1	*	This adds nothing to the thread, downvoted.

t1_dswzirv	0	*	No they just shut off medical funding and then doctors dont find it worth their time to perform procedures. Look at rural areas where access is next to impossible. 
t1_dsykfpt	1	*	>Vilifying women who seek abortions and abortion doctors is legal  If it's legal, how does it run counter to charter of rights and freedoms?
t1_dsxt4fp	1	*	Again, we're talking about Canada. Pot is on the verge of legalization and can hardly be considered outlawed. 
t1_dswm5n0	0	*	Except for the ones that aren't. Leaving open legal grounds to force someone to carry their rapist's child to term is far more horrific, imo.
t1_dswpnj9	0	*	You won't get a response. It simply doesn't compute in this thread. There are tons of prolife people who have no problem with social services.
t1_dswwrmo	1	*	Did you reply to the wrong thread? You're the first person to mention the US in the specific chain you are in.
t1_dsxu6kd	1	*	He also said he could give 100% to both being an MPP and a Brock student. I think that he needs a little more education about the way percentages work. 
t1_dsx8op8	0	*	 Provide scientific proof when life begins. That will prove this is not a philosophical issue.   You can't do that so you paint my ideas as emotional, but you have no logic backing yours up

t1_dsy3y6r	0	*	Hey nothing wrong with that. Hopefully you make time out of your busy Xbox trading schedule to find some sexual satisfaction yourself!
t1_dsxb2dp	0	*	I'm an atheist too, which is why I agree with the medical interpretation that a fetus isn't a human and shouldn't have more rights than the mother.

t1_dswpw1x	0	*	Comparing a fetus to a living, breathing woman is also disingenuous.

t1_dsx9dcj	1	*	A man is great if today he is greater than yesterday and tomorrow than today.
t1_dswm9o6	1	*	I agree, but I don't see what that has to do with my comment. I'm not asking anyone to kiss up to any religion.

t1_dswodc8	0	*	Hahahaha, she's a journalist and she cited a scientific study, she clearly cannot be trusted!  What a weak argument. You know journalists are capable of citing a source and reading abstracts right? 
t1_dswme3z	0	*	Who's saying that they are superior? All of this boils down to insecurities, when you're insecure about your opinions and beliefs, that should tell you something, 
t1_dswp0lf	0	*	Well not really.  The existence of ambiguity itself supports a less restrictive pro-choice public policy much more than it would support a highly restrictive pro-life public policy.

t1_ds1svsi	1	*	Shooting armed militias engaged in insurrection is fine.  Shooting people who call for insurrection, but not taking any active step towards it  is evil. 
t1_ds1cctg	1	*	My understanding was that intent to place people at great harm was a key part of a death threat. (Threats by definition involve signaling of intent.)
t1_ds1pvt4	1	*	At least Trump spews hate speech on a regular level and based a large part of his campaign on it. See his comments regarding Mexico.
t1_ds6rsah	1	*	I don't see the difference between one person making a promise (Obama) and many persons making a promise (Brexit). They both promise things they may not keep for votes.
t1_ds6g4oj	1	*	The EU can't just willi nilli put sanctions on a member. They need to actually break an written rule. And even then, often just one other member can veto it.

t1_ds77d10	1	*	I wont even bother talk to you if you really believe that. Go back to your bubble please
t1_dt2pebx	1	*	>I still dont see your point.  My point is most popular hiphop music is promoting drug/violence/disrespect of women/gang culture/racism and values that many people have no problem living without 
t1_duyskpp	0	*	Eh, 1 out of 2. Got you on the turtle ships and Japanese invasions though, which was my initial point.
t1_duz171o	0	*	Are you unaware of oppression by the regime or do you deny it?
t1_dslygkw	1	*	>  cannibals in Brazil  Shows how bigoted you are 
t1_dsmg36o	0	*	Sure, but we are not arguing whether its true, we're arguing whether it is insulting. 
t1_dsm0ymj	1	*	>You're making assumptions  Pot meet kettle
t1_dsm5bi1	1	*	Well we even had a plan b4, its just that the CDU/CSU got in government and scrapped that plan immediately.
t1_dsmzbkk	1	*	Couldn't have put it better myself.
t1_dus792x	0	*	Sure, it was. But wouldn't you agree that these top four socialist dictators (Mao, Stalin, Pot, Hitler) basically max out the evil-meter to the point where comparisons are pointless? 
t1_duufv2v	1	*	Astonishing IRA, Diet IRA, the Really Real IRA, IRAyyy, the IR-eh (Canadian branch), the IPA - Irish publicans army, the D-ira and the IAMA-RA
t1_duubna3	0	*	It blows my mind that NIP is still around. They were on top when I used to play on CS 1.6 with HeatoN, etc. And that was like in 2002 or something.
t1_duuavhg	0	*	Glad you said they're a professional team in CS:GO because they sure as shit ain't professional in LoL.

t1_ds8wyab	0	*	You corrected it, congrats.
t1_ds8hdku	1	*	True. I guess I was specifically talking about what hes done already, which doesn't yet include the arctic. 
t1_ds85ko4	0	*	Except to lower the cost of gas and find new oil when our old fields dry up? Oil isn't renewable yo, we got to keep drilling if we want to keep using. It's our addiction!
t1_ds97dns	0	*	Where a this from? It sounds very poignant and I like it 
t1_ds8e0xn	0	*	The infallible UN? Lol  In 12 years we'll see if America is fighting wars for water I guess.

t1_ds8hdqp	0	*	More people alive to sell your products to! Muwahahahahahaha
t1_ds8an63	0	*	Do you think it's worth risking US environment on the off chance that they won't just sell the oil back to other countries to get rich, and not solve US dependency on foreign oil?
t1_dt9oiuv	0	*	How is the guy with less votes winning freedom though?
t1_dt9kefl	0	*	There's a very large amount of Americans who believe gun policy is the most important aspect of a candidate
t1_dt9dxyh	0	*	Those show a secret society, or 2 agents that clearly don't like Trump and were removed?  You maybe don't want to answer that.

t1_dt9bnoi	0	*	You can't confirm third hand reports.
t1_dtbb5gg	0	*	k all i am saying mainstream media have been already caught faking sources / stories etc all for ratings
t1_dt9c8v9	0	*	He was agreeing with you.
t1_dt9gytu	0	*	What does any of that have to do with the Democrats had 8 years?  That would imply Dems had full control of government, just as conservatives do now.  Having a Democrat president doesnt count.
t1_dt9fcqp	0	*	Pence is lawful evil, Trump is chaotic evil
t1_dt9pwkj	0	*	Old Iron Guts, they call him. 
t1_dt9ei8w	0	*	But he's also given the world a head start on understanding and resisting another campaign of the same style.  In a sense, Trump is the hero America deserves.
t1_dt9gzkr	1	*	Stellar username
t1_dt97v1h	0	*	You said Democrats had 8 years.  That is factually incorrect.  They had 2 years at best.  Obama was not the extent of the Democrats.
t1_dt9uqxc	0	*	The Kock brothers ordered the solar panel tariff by giving millions in ~~bribes~~ campaign donations. Gotta protect the coal industry 
t1_dt9jd3y	1	*	I don't think anyone reasonable is arguing that we should not have the right to own firearms.
t1_dt9qhtq	1	*	Legit, I'm still salty over it.
t1_dt9pj5b	1	*	Wait, didnt the Republicans have something to do with the dossier first before handing it off or letting it go so the Dems picked it up? 
t1_dtacxmm	1	*	Interesting.  We won't be joining that for a while here lol
t1_dt9ezll	0	*	SO WHY NOT RELEASE THE EVIDENCE THAT SHOWS THEY ARE DEEP STATE OPERATIVES, AND THEN FIRE THEM.
t1_dt9ii9g	0	*	can the EU just annex us, and we'll be governed directly by brussels? 
t1_dt9fj9m	0	*	The spokesman for the Special Counsel declined to comment.
t1_dt9glzd	0	*	Yet, all those people voted for him. I wonder what he would have to do for them not to vote for him. How can someone who didn't pay the working man, possibly represent the working man?
t1_dt98int	1	*	It doesnt have to be about race, but it was.  That much was obvious.  The entire tea party movement was a racist backlash to a country that was growing more liberal and out of their comfort zone.
t1_dt9daw7	0	*	The bigliest. Everyone says so. 
t1_dtannq1	1	*	You know that there is no difference right?
t1_dt9fga2	0	*	Can you share more of these facts besides the Senate majority? I'm interested to hear why you believe this shift occurred between the 40s and the 90s.
t1_dt9s32n	0	*	Lol. When you have to play stupid and pretend you no longer speak English to try to argue an angle, why are you even arguing it?
t1_dt9vftn	1	*	Go ahead. I'm no fan of Trump either, by any means.  I'm also not a fan of hypocrisy, though. 
t1_dt9i7fe	1	*	Thanks for letting us know youre not worth arguing with :) 
t1_dtbdvv3	1	*	... The fuck?
t1_dta0tnn	1	*	Nope. Sean Hannity, who is clearly a liberal shill, reported on the report of this incident. So we cant trust Fox News anymore. /s
t1_dt9hx7k	0	*	I think you should be taking your own advice and questioning yourself and what you believe.
t1_dt9o3bv	0	*	Irony ^ 
t1_dt9vfcj	1	*	Do you normally get someone to take offense with such a poorly devised insult/insinuation? At least be creative.
t1_dt9fq12	0	*	There is a velocity problem were news companies have to make lots of content.  However the clarity of some events might change as more information develops, nuance exists.
t1_dt9d89f	1	*	Could always grow your own or try darknet markets. Each will require a bit of effort if you haven't done them before. 
t1_dt9lat3	0	*	Oh, look. A Trump fan.  He knows we're talking about cheating on taxes and not paying contractors, but plays dumb. At least I hope he just plays it.
t1_dt93qdi	0	*	It makes a claim, sights anonymous sources, then present information to support their claim.   It doesnt provide proof.
t1_dtb0lm3	1	*	>There weren't any candidates that were well suited for office.   FTFY
t1_dt9f2hh	0	*	I mean, if you tack that onto anything, it's gonna sound better than the alternative.  This fish taco is two weeks old, but it won't start a nuclear war, sooooo...
t1_dtab7zh	0	*	Ok, fair enough, however, I have a hard time believing 1 in 4 Americans believe the sun revolves around the earth. 
t1_dt9rifw	0	*	Wut the hell did i just read...?  
t1_dt9c6fs	1	*	You weren't doing anything, the other poster accused you of trolling while they were trolling.  that is a Karl Rove Tactic.
t1_dtablfs	0	*	No, it's a simplification. But what do you think would happen if the law stops working for people? That they'll do nothing? Or that they'll settle for saying pretty please? 
t1_dt9iwvy	0	*	Autocracy is coming.
t1_dt9bemq	1	*	Textbook generic.
t1_dt9b8fs	0	*	Why would he not?
t1_dt9jx3q	0	*	Donald Trump 
t1_dt9d09h	0	*	youre an idiot too bro.
t1_dt9ma1w	0	*	Still no source that wasn't told what happened.
t1_dt9s2a4	1	*	IIRC, it's *both*.  You don't get that gelatinous by limiting yourself to either/or. 
t1_dt9bb3a	0	*	Yet He still has a better track record than NYT...
t1_dt9duz7	1	*	UH NO, he defended the Constitution, something no other liberals give a shit about these days apparently.   Fascist views, yea, trying to overturn an election isn't at all fascist. GFY.
t1_dt9aydt	0	*	The current problem is not whether they'll vote, but getting them to agree on who to vote for, traditional democrat or progressive democrat.
t1_dt9dh3i	0	*	Ill believe it when I see it. The upcoming midterms will tell you everything you need to know. 
t1_dt96gi5	0	*	After. That case, *Burdick v. United States*, was decided in 1915.
t1_dt9e7fp	0	*	>Openly ran against Trump   Those are called primaries.   
t1_dtaml5r	1	*	Yeah I definitely believe in Mueller's abilities and approach to building a solid case i.e. going about things in the right way. Hope something comes out of it. Just can't kick my natural cynicism. 
t1_dt9byvd	1	*	Yea, that's a hell of an ask.  That was about as good as we've ever seen him play.  I'd LOVE to see it, but I'm not counting on it.
t1_dtakwfu	0	*	And you think we wouldve been shafted by Hillary?!
t1_dtbanj4	1	*	Thanks <3 :).

t1_dt9h4dr	0	*	No worries! Have a great day/night!
t1_dt9b0u9	1	*	Lol. 
t1_dtb73n3	1	*	Conspiracy theories are silly.  Conspiracy theories desperately clung to in an attempt to avoid justice are repugnant.  For serious conversation, start with critical thinking.
t1_dt9r9ow	1	*	And then scream on twitter it was the other way around. 
t1_dt9dp1r	1	*	Is that the next hole in the sand to bury my head in?

t1_dt9rzmh	1	*	Believe it, there are pot smokers out there happy as hell that Jeff Sessions is Attorney General. Absolute insanity.
t1_dt9uz7l	1	*	I think we should also remember that Obama literally won the Nobel prize for not being Bush

t1_dt9ejnu	0	*	People have said that about the penguins in december/January in BOTH the last two years and that never stopped them from those cups.  In all realism it's probably going to be the lightning this year.

t1_dtc4t0h	1	*	Aight, Ill put it on my (way too long) list of shows to watch/catch up on.
t1_dtaju00	1	*	Gets me every time.... :( 
t1_dt9qfdj	1	*	Trump would never plead the fifth. It's career suicide. To be fair, though, it's not like his career has much of a life left anyways. 
t1_dtanh1m	1	*	Thats saying something isnt it? Its sad our meter for bad has had its bottom rung set so damn high now. We need better choices dammit!
t1_dt9v8g9	0	*	That doesnt strike you as dumb?  Wouldnt it be better to reliably get less and keep it rather than get more knowing you are going to lose all of it? 
t1_dtajmph	1	*	If the system is at fault then everyone under said system is a victim Next election you'll get some other guy who won't defend the little guy either and wonder where it all went wrong.
t1_dtaib4j	0	*	Honestly I bet Comey thought Hillary was a shoe-in, so he announced it before the election so he would seem nonpartisan and honest, but it backfired. 
t1_dt9klsz	1	*	And immediately overturn Citizens United.
t1_dt9e79f	0	*	You either OD'd on orange cool aid or you're a Russian troll. Looking at your writing style its hard to tell though. My third best guess is meth addict.
t1_dt9gd04	1	*	When you speak in all caps, you must be trying to make a point... what is it?
t1_dt9geo2	1	*	Oh I am. My money is on FBI agents getting charged with obstructing the Clinton investigation. On that we actually have proof. Written proof.
t1_dta7myd	1	*	Fair enough.
t1_dt9arp9	1	*	This seems like it should be completely legal and a great idea /s.

t1_dt9e75o	0	*	Literally what? We have plenty of context, you've just chosen to ignore it. In fact you'd get plenty of context by googling Strozk Text Messages.

t1_dt9ov6w	0	*	No he didnt 
t1_dt9oznx	1	*	The people seem to be represented just fine considering the support for the president.  
t1_dt9mpmd	1	*	Yes, that's why they are regressive. They want to use solutions of the past to solve modern problems and return to an romanticized past that never existed.  The very definition of regressive 
t1_dt9gzao	0	*	The meaningless cherry-picked fact that one candidate got more votes but still lost? You're delusional

t1_dt9cx0f	1	*	Can one post-date a pardon, so one can commit a crime in the future and not be charged/imprisoned? Asking for a friend. 
t1_dt9rlm5	1	*	2x1/4#er is why I'm fat. There's a McDonald's right next to my work.
t1_dt9f668	0	*	Let me rephrase the question. What do you personally do to make sure you know what is going on in the world and to be informed about what politicians are doing? Who provides that information for you?
t1_dt9bc2e	0	*	They are reporting on a report.... What don't you understand about that?
t1_dt9k4lf	0	*	Ok, well you can disagree with me, that is fine, but if you turn to being a asshole you are clearly the one that is insecure with your ideas. 
t1_dt9csxt	1	*	And text messages between FBI agents
t1_dtfmgm4	0	*	Oh I'm sure CNN reported that. And I'm sure the Russians made McCabe step down too?  You're so deep in the propaganda that you don't even know it.

t1_dv2910h	0	*	Any wild horse wont let you ride it. Everything must be domesticated first :)  Edit: I just pictured Gimli flying an eagle haha. 
t1_dud42k6	0	*	Yeah that is one of his black marks in the history books, not capitulating to the nazis. Awesome point man. /s
t1_dudtgfj	0	*	Chemical weapons you mean tear gas? lol The things governments use on their own civilians today? He wasn't talking about gassing them, read the rest of the quote before getting all outraged.
t1_dud227t	1	*	I mean these actions stem from fucked up ideas and problems. Like racism.
t1_ducftgd	0	*	Oh I followed the lines wrong. I thought you were replying to the guy saying Churchill was bad like Stalin.
t1_ducsh6p	0	*	Your cartoons came with a disclaimer??
t1_duca7wu	0	*	Which in Churchill's case is quite insulting to his contemporaries like Clement Attlee. Even by the standards of his time, Churchill was an arsehole.
t1_duc9rp7	1	*	Why call it a genocide of the Germans then? Because the things that happened were part of an ethnic cleansing, which is a crime in itself, but nowhere close to a genocide.
t1_ducpr6p	1	*	You're playing bait and switch with 'regering' and 'overheid' which both translate to 'government'.  
t1_ducjj5d	0	*	How do governments inherit mandates to govern but not blame?
t1_ducti8l	0	*	Source? I find that extremely hard to believe
t1_ducimin	0	*	Got a link so I can read about these sailors?
t1_ducmdgu	0	*	Missing your triple brackets there, my dude.
t1_dsg5nmy	0	*	So they'd be ethnically Iranian, Indian, or Nigerian. They may well be UK citizens but that doesn't make them ethnically English lol. The modern UK is a multicultural society.
t1_dsgp2wt	0	*	I understand that the initial flood of light into a dark room can be painful, and such an awakening can be uncomfortable.  I underwent the same process myself.  The truth may ultimately set you free.
t1_duoyqme	1	*	In this case I expect a little outburst is for the benefit of domestic audiences... not the Iranians... and probably calculated to be well worth upsetting them.
t1_dunfpzl	0	*	Its a manifestation of a cultural attitude, its like saying that laws against gay marriage have nothing to do with a countries attitude towards gay people.
t1_ds8yape	1	*	> Plain whataboutism.  I think I give up
t1_dsyks9i	0	*	No, but it is your fault that youre a vile soulless wretch that barely approximates a human being. I hope when your evil finally consumes you its painful. You dont deserve less.
t1_dsyj8e8	1	*	Boy what a strong argument. Is hyperbole all you have left?
t1_dsyleii	0	*	He had wall funding on the table dude. $1.6 billion dollars is a lot more than the zero dollars he'll have once he caves to the exact same bill he was offered two weeks ago. 
t1_dsyjdom	0	*	What do you mean?
t1_dsyk6yb	1	*	Tell that to James I. He couldve used a memo. 
t1_dsram74	1	*	Given that the vast majority of lithium produced uses the sun to evaporate lithium brine, Im going to have to call bullshit on that.

t1_du60ti1	1	*	There's like a 20% tariff on Canadian Softwood Lumber. Trump might not have been listening, but someone in the whitehous was
t1_du6p0ys	0	*	Didn't know China was infinitely large.  My mistake. 
t1_du6qy75	1	*	My cousin's one hell of a stubborn bastard and just got out of basic.  You'd be surprised, man.
t1_du7enlx	1	*	You're really underestimating the type of conditioning that they go through.
t1_du7g1xg	1	*	Were you considering joining up though?  Since I didn't want to be there, no matter how nice/mean they were I wouldn't put up with it.  If you *want* to be there then you'll out up with the bullshit.
t1_dtm9so4	1	*	> just how much we don't need the U.S.  So, when's your final in Poli Sci 101?
t1_dtm6ff1	1	*	The answer is really quite simple, my friend: they have all the guns.  
t1_dtm0vn2	1	*	First of all, how dare you. Second of all, way to make me feel old! Thirdly, how dare you.
t1_dtm2cv0	0	*	We know; Trump is just under the impression that coal is the future.
t1_dtmngfo	1	*	Radiation Rapist  vibrating your body in a very healthy way, without consent
t1_dtk7a07	0	*	Any animal dropped to an unfamiliar environment alone has very little chances of long term survival.    Humans are by far the best at adapting to any new situation, environment and climate imaginable.
t1_dswsis3	1	*	The signage is bad but it's the paperwork that will kill ya.
t1_dsw9feg	1	*	Also known as the only two successful instances of giving a mayonnaise and white bread sandwich sentience.
t1_dswj1wa	0	*	well, not her.. her ancestors did. maybe.
t1_dswf9j3	1	*	Not entirely sure why you would give a knight hood to someone who had no use for it... I am still pissed that he ruined knighthoods for everyone else though.
t1_dswoc3u	0	*	He's also the reason the coalition agreement includes promoting and improving our relationship and trade with the russian federation. In 2017. Bloody insanity.
t1_dswsoxs	0	*	SA sure, but India kept its nukes.  The US isn't going to like this either, dislike of monarchy is the one thing that hasn't been politicized.
t1_dswuoni	1	*	Split Enz ? 
t1_dsxyytl	1	*	For me, It's simply that you will never, ever hear a major Democrat support public housing. National did, so that's my banana for scale.
t1_dswwjop	1	*	Who doesn't...^Please ^don't ^count ^ODI's

t1_dsx11su	0	*	The first, reprehensible. The second, curiously tempting. I can't imagine how these could be seen as being anywhere near similarly offensive. 
t1_dswn6lv	0	*	A lot of great nations are Canadas. South Korea is Japan's Canada. Austria is Germany's Canada. Sri Lanka is India's Canada. Italy has three micro-Canadas.
t1_dsyglwg	0	*	No, I just call them a bad unfit leader, unlike Trump who is in fantastic health .
t1_dswmhaa	1	*	moistened bint, she was moist. 
t1_dswxw2i	0	*	> no wonder it leads to overinflated egos more often than not.  Somehow it hasn't inflated Liz's ego, she is a wonder and a treasure to humanity.
t1_dtkpvsp	0	*	Yes, its fairly easy to prove the government didn't collaborate, so I understand it being illegal to day otherwise. The headline would've been a messed up law.
t1_dtdvl49	1	*	It's not an attack on democracy if troops aren't on the ground, riiiiight?
t1_dtfit8k	1	*	Sure but they don't produce the statistics, the unelected civil servants do from hard data.   Hey, do you think no-go zones are real?
t1_dsv7tc5	0	*	> Multicultural would be tourists & illegals.   ...  No, not really.   But you don't like tourism either? Wow, that takes xenophobia up a notch doesn't it?

t1_ds7fdyd	0	*	Dude, I LIVED in Korea.  I ATE Dog on a dare from collegues.  I have been to the markets where they sell dog meat.  My knowledge in this matter does not come from some link.

t1_dux1idv	1	*	but she was worse...  because...  no no let's just vote for the idiot or the anti vaccinator
t1_duwbuvl	0	*	Remember the primaries where Ted Cruz threw shade?
t1_duwx7h6	0	*	I wouldn't give the US a 3. I'd give it a 7 and Canada an 8. Yeah, there is a lot of corruption, but its worse in other places. We have good lives here. We are generally safe most of the time. 
t1_duw8iux	1	*	Terrible guy, actually. It's just that you clods in that incel subreddit T_D idolize his dumb, hate-filled ass for some reason.
t1_duvy69t	0	*	They're probably pretty cautious about embellishing statements from sources as the source may not be willing to work with them again

t1_duahc2s	1	*	Him too. 
t1_dszmktg	0	*	I mean, the guy in the cart on the street isn't likely to have the political clout to make a difference.  At least, not the way Papa Johns or Chick Fil A can.
t1_dszuaax	0	*	>People like him are why people can claim that capitalism is flawed.  Not sure I've ever heard anyone claim it is perfect, but it's just the best of any alternatives.
t1_dsznf4p	0	*	>  They deffinately are refusing to work.  They played the game, that is their work. Standing during the anthem isn't,

t1_dszmhpg	0	*	Interesting where your priorities lie.
t1_dszrs5l	0	*	... So do you want to argue semantics? You know i did not mean 100% of businesses stop playing dumb.
t1_dszjoql	1	*	Yeah I'm quickly realizing this xD, thank you
t1_dt04543	1	*	Is there anything measurable that says this decision is costing them money? People squaking on the internet doesn't really count as evidence. 
t1_dt0yu62	1	*	And what is a living wage?
t1_dszf96v	1	*	Works fine through Reddit is Fun app.
t1_dt06aqw	0	*	Honestly its more expensive than dominos and worse.
t1_dszzgd8	0	*	Would you like some creationism cheese and red cuppers on your propaganda pizza?
t1_dszjb94	0	*	How is saying he would find a way to pass the cost on to consumers sayi g he soesnt want to pay his employees? Do you just not like anyone who is rich?
t1_dszte47	0	*	Not necessarily. It would depend on the volume of pizzas sold, correct? If another company sells far more pizzas and employs the same number of people their increase could be less.
t1_dszzwhh	1	*	At least 80 Courics...Bono Scale
t1_dszjsfq	1	*	Its a Canadian company owned by a Brazilian company. That still makes it a Canadian company. 
t1_dszoono	1	*	I think his point is that if the KKK as a group comes out in approval of what you're doing, your actions fall in line with their beliefs...as a group they share a unifying belief system. 
t1_dt00w0y	1	*	Depends on the pizza guy, really, and the chicks.
t1_dsztsah	0	*	Educate yourself. MLK and Dubois both held great admiration for Margaret Sanger. Serving the POC community and wanting them dead are not the same thing.
t1_dszfaqv	0	*	Whoops, had the setting on private, try now.
t1_dszl4m5	0	*	Exactly, so use your energy on changing policies, rather than short term, small scale, relatively ineffective wins.
t1_dsr6dz7	1	*	On the Islamic activists part it appears I was confusing it with a different case. My mistake. 
t1_dsjr2ej	0	*	I was thinking the Volkskrant. Or was there something else?  Edited for spelling.
t1_dsjghrk	0	*	But if anybody wants to pay me to shitpost about fringe right wing politics you can send me a PM. I am doing the same thing for free, so I won't be expensive. 
t1_dsjpbrp	1	*	*Goddang horseshoes.*
t1_dsjacmq	1	*	Right. Because this thread isnt about the very kind of people we are discussing.

t1_dsjg9uu	0	*	sweden had almost no crime before the mass influx of muslims
t1_dsjb0xz	1	*	The_donald misses you my friend. My conspiracies vs yours.  No convincing me nor you.  
t1_dsjbjfg	0	*	I can see that and I can also see that other republicans should reconsider the association given how tainted it both is in perception and reality. 
t1_dsj4zb9	1	*	I think you just had decent parents. Not everyone deserves reverence.
t1_dsj9bdi	0	*	So everyone who claims to be a libertarian is no true libertarian?  At some point you need to account for the fact that every libertarian we see is against gay marriage, immigration and abortion. 
t1_dsjpbfu	1	*	*Goddang horseshoes.*
t1_dsj9iyd	0	*	I guessing you were not even born in the 1990s.  Everybody loved the fuck out of Bill Clinton (except congressional Republicans).  
t1_dsjgksu	1	*	http://www.heritage.org/index/ranking I don't know how, they might have how they calculate it somewhere but I'm not sure. 
t1_dsjjiae	0	*	Florida? Backwater shithole definitely still applies
t1_dsjdxdb	0	*	> less laws = less crime  Yes.
t1_dsjn5e8	1	*	Its really not needed. When a third party has any idea or policy thAt appeals, either the conservative or liberal party will jump on it and co-opt it for their own new policies. 
t1_dsji7nt	0	*	what does this refer to? 
t1_dsj7r9j	0	*	We are a republic
t1_dsj8uhe	1	*	And the rule isn't going to change under the Republican majority, because they're the ones that benefit most from it.
t1_dsjdoda	0	*	No I didn't. I explicitly said that was *not* what a no go zone was. Try to keep up.
t1_dsjh3jh	0	*	Yeah you've got the libertarian party. They'll help sell heroine to kids. or you've got the Green Party. They'll ban wifi cause it causes cancer. 
t1_dsj8n8j	0	*	Isn't that why you all want guns still? To overthrow a tyrannical government?
t1_dsji5wa	0	*	Can you give me an example of speech that infringes on someone else's rights? 
t1_dsju3no	1	*	Theres DRM the developers built into the code that makes that really hard.
t1_dsj9bq1	0	*	So then why are you a Republican
t1_dsj6mnu	1	*	I didn't realize this was a Dutch thing. My attitude makes way more sense now. 
t1_dsjcr5e	1	*	I'm not the one making the claim - the ambassador and other right wingers are.  I'm not responsible for them being morons. 
t1_dsji3uw	0	*	That's what i thought.  But i was kinda hoping to get the '0bama was a secret Muslim who invented isis' reply.
t1_dsjj4kc	0	*	The Republican Party has been one of the major problems in our country.  Unfortunately we are under a two party system and Republicans at least are the lesser of the two evils
t1_dsj9i80	0	*	Er, what lie did she tell about the server? 
t1_dsj8tpy	1	*	Trump also cheated to win.
t1_dsjq2s1	0	*	Resist isn't a liberal, that's for sure.
t1_dsjgfc5	0	*	Wilder against Sylvana?  
t1_dsj7wgo	0	*	Legal to too many people. The fact that someone on the terrorist watch list is able to legally purchase a firearm is problematic to say the least.
t1_dsjg738	1	*	Proportional representation is desperately needed, thr first past the post system discourages the success of any but the incumbent parties. 
t1_dsj914m	1	*	You made some good points. 
t1_dsjlzr1	1	*	I think this same kind of lack of general comprehension is what leads to most right wing policies and ideas
t1_dsj9bf4	0	*	We spread democracy so much, we didn't keep any for ourselves.
t1_dsjtl67	0	*	I was just in a Gothenburg. Very high immigrant population. I saw no evidence of out of control crime and felt considerably safer than in my medium sized US hometown.
t1_dsj9gni	1	*	This strawman here. 
t1_dsjyqdt	0	*	I give it a year at most before Trump begins attempting to use force.
t1_dsjbfyg	0	*	That's not what's being claimed though. 
t1_dsjaa8h	0	*	Why do you ask?
t1_dsjpj9a	0	*	Thanks for the fix! 
t1_dsjizb1	0	*	That doesn't make him the same as Trump. Wilders is motivated by race, race, race, and anything he sees as directly advancing that cause. Trump is bad on race but also bad on a million other issues.
t1_dsjf2ac	1	*	Unless you're poor. 
t1_dsjit2f	0	*	Lol if you think that.
t1_dsjh6rq	0	*	You have mind-cancer
t1_dsjvs5w	0	*	no go is a pretty staight forward phrase that is meant to be literally interpreted. Its not no live for extended periods of time while drinking the municipal water.
t1_dsjc44s	0	*	The third parties in the US aren't really much better, and you would need an overhaul of the constitution. 
t1_dsjmkzm	0	*	I'm also from the states and have the same sentiment. 
t1_dsjsbks	0	*	Reality. Been there, seen it for myself. Won't fall for a  Who you gonna believe, me or your lying eyes? bs.
t1_dsjcj2n	1	*	Even on its best days its a democratic republic 
t1_dsjewd6	1	*	Wilders has to believe in what he says, he has given up his whole private life for it
t1_dsltu1n	0	*	'maybe' muslims burned dutch politicians.  Doesn't make it any less ridiculous.
t1_dsjehr3	0	*	Are you showing yet?
t1_dsjknv1	1	*	Diplomatic issues is a better way of putting it, than political. Everything is political at that level. Even if this guy was refused it would be political.
t1_dsj9nob	1	*	Seriously. Do people in other countries believe we just have the power to change everything just like that? Super simple...
t1_dsjabn4	0	*	Nope, not a pure democracy.  I highly doubt any country is a pure democracy though.  It wouldn't work.
t1_dsl959l	1	*	Yes. I am excusing him as a human, not an ambassador.
t1_dsj9gwk	1	*	It has to be satirical, it's almost unbelievable.   
t1_dsj7s0l	0	*	Well, yeah. Because T_D is a cesspool of sad internet trolls. No need to discuss anything with them. I'm sorry if I did you wrong, I still deny your statement that both parties are the same.
t1_dsje79s	0	*	Its so disheartening knowing that a good chunk of my countrymen simply do not exist in the same reality as the rest of us.
t1_dsjwljm	1	*	Are the trumpets right?  Should we just ignore opinions from Europeans because of the country they are from?  
t1_dsk9y86	1	*	Well, it seems to work for us. You guys must be doing something wrong.
t1_dsj8u79	0	*	> poetically identical  I don't think this means what you think it means.
t1_dsj4q7q	0	*	> Wanting your family to be proud of you is natural.  And it's completely unrelated with ignoring their orders when those are not backed by good reasons.
t1_dsjflk0	0	*	So that is what happened to net neutrality ;)
t1_dsjnxnc	0	*	You do the math however you want. 
t1_dsjb7cy	1	*	I wish my parents were too. 
t1_dsj7pwc	1	*	Partisan Hacks can't be reasoned with, which is why this political climate exists. Don't even try to defend yourself versus them.
t1_dsjv6ji	0	*	Yes but at one point he was an elected official, which is all I'm trying to say. Jesus christ it isn't difficult
t1_dsjrpjy	1	*	That's the problem though; Republicans don't hold other Republicans accountable. At all. Republicans were perfectly willing to endorse and promote an alleged child molester to the U.S. Senate. 
t1_dsl98q9	1	*	I do like the practice of continuing to ask the same question until it is answered. The White House press corps should adopt it.
t1_dsj9y4u	0	*	If every Democrat in red states voted, I guarantee you Hillary would have won by far.. Individual votes almost never matter anywhere - it is the pool of people that matter...
t1_dsjgq5q	0	*	Both sides gotcha.
t1_dsjatnd	0	*	Well no, it's a representative democracy. 
t1_dsjednf	0	*	They're both stressful as hell to listen to was my point.
t1_dsjevmc	1	*	Hahaha I think that's the best thing about becoming an adult. You slowly realize that most of the older people around you have always been childish. 
t1_dskhtxh	1	*	French Canadian. My father is from France... if you want to contest that fact you can lol
t1_dsk8m6o	0	*	I will tell people to go to Belgium instead. Brussels was a much better place to visit.  
t1_dskqaf2	1	*	Indeed. The information is there, and Trump is what we chose. We shot ourselves in the foot. It was despite my best efforts, and maybe your best efforts, but we still did this.
t1_dsjfign	0	*	you're*
t1_dsjfgfm	0	*	Which is his job--to represent the current administration. I think he did a fine job showing hecklers how to be a professional.
t1_dsj8bj0	0	*	Wanting to restrict immigration != white ethnostate. Unless you know something else regarding Miller, he is in no way a white nationalist.
t1_dsj6n4y	1	*	Dude, you can't just come in to these peoples' circle jerk and just say the truth like that. What were you thinking you mad man?
t1_dsjc4fc	1	*	Some Bernie or bust types as well, though statistically speaking, most of the people claiming to be such on Reddit were probably just Trump supporters trying to muddy the waters. 
t1_dsjip4v	0	*	Yeah, I think it's safe to call ISIS a no-go zone.  A little different then talking about Denmark. Try and keep up.  
t1_dsjcn4g	1	*	Oh. That's ringing a bell. Did he do an entire jimquisition on it at one point? 
t1_dsl4cxm	0	*	Thanks.  I'll pretend that 3391 people also voted for John McAfee on dares, too.
t1_dsjk6cx	0	*	> question**s**
t1_dsjuebj	1	*	But all I was saying a person shouldn't feel unsafe coming to America. Of course you have to be smart and stay out of the undesirable areas.
t1_dska5ow	0	*	Just don't get sick. Or not be white.
t1_dtyp917	0	*	yeah forgive me for referencing the national conversation this was a proxy for. 
t1_dsj91a0	1	*	As far as I know, no, they haven't, although situations like this are theoretically why they have the power to do just that. They didn't, but they could (and maybe should) have.
t1_dsjnktb	1	*	It does matter because if everyones voted counted the same he would have lost, thats the point. Trump didn't win through the people; rather, he through the system - which is all or nothing mind you.
t1_dsjcuum	0	*	http://www.logicalfallacies.info/presumption/no-true-scotsman/
t1_dsj874f	1	*	You're probably misi... Nah, seems like you're right.
t1_dsjaxj5	1	*	If his staff successfully took away his Twitter account  shit would be going a lot more smoothly. 
t1_dsk768q	1	*	This is the correct answer. I'm just tired of identity politics. 
t1_dsjg01f	1	*	Your healthcare is worse than I thought
t1_dsjmmu6	0	*	Then you must really enjoy living in the United States...
t1_dsjl7v7	0	*	But no access to affordable healthcare and no access to affordable education is limiting freedom.

t1_dsj9m62	1	*	Does this guy not realize we have background checks or something? The idiocy is astounding 
t1_dsjlu6z	0	*	Well, what part of the US would you be going to? It's a big place, my friend.
t1_dsjfwpr	1	*	That's nuts!
t1_dsjf6dk	0	*	I just dont buy that excuse. People voted for him. A majority of the Republicans in the primary picked Trump. He is wholly representative of the party and to voters. 
t1_dsjrzhe	1	*	Awesome argument- I'm stunned
t1_dsj8rj3	0	*	So in short: More people actually want the Democrats, but the Republicans are far better at abusing the system?
t1_dsjbaiv	0	*	I'd call it an idiocracy at this point.
t1_dsjbyos	1	*	There are 3rd parties, but none of them are better.
t1_dsjfhdp	1	*	Has America instituted an electoral college system in other countries? I genuinely dont know. 
t1_dsjo01b	1	*	I am not sure if there is any population out there that hates the US more than the people of Palestine ... North Korea maybe.  You are setting your priorities wrong.
t1_dsj8x1t	0	*	> So the US is not a democracy then  No, its a functioning plutocracy 
t1_dsj62o1	0	*	TV is life. You're right. People that exist off of TV don't exist in real life. Shit, why did I forget this?
t1_dsj9h2r	1	*	Ah what a shame.  That was your birthday present. 
t1_dsj9mss	0	*	Congratulations, you are officially to stupid to talk to. Happy trolling, please consider all of the Netherlands a no-go zone from now on.
t1_dsjklxq	1	*	He did well just by having the clip ready to throw at the ambassador. He opened the can of worms. 
t1_dsjcard	0	*	>Then Id say they arent true Libertarians.  LOL
t1_dsjh5yl	0	*	This is why I don't believe in America, anymore.

t1_dsj8opm	0	*	Never celebrate the 4th of July ever again. If that is the typical American attitude then you don't deserve   that dumbass patriotic party.

t1_dsjjtz8	1	*	You dont need to interview a politician in order to do investigative journalism. Of course you offer them a chance to answer questions, but they are allowed to say no comment.

t1_du08iht	1	*	No they wont. Going back to NK to talk about how great SK is amounts to a major crime in NK.   Youd probably be thrown in a work camp for life for even entertaining the idea that SK is somehow better.

t1_dv2pqbj	1	*	You can solve multiple problems at once, and resolving some can cause multiplier effects. Yemen's problem is partly overpopulation, because of geo and econ constraints 
t1_dtdsh6m	1	*	Well, and actual *scientists* who actually understand climate cycles and CO2 absorption and geeky stuff like that....  But hey, don't get in the way of a good panic!

t1_dsq7f0g	1	*	Since when are Egypt and Jordan first world countries? 
t1_dsq4eb2	1	*	Oslo accords in the 90's. The problem is that the leadership decided to ignore the new accords and instead encouraged the second intifada, resulting in near daily bombings of cafes and busses.
t1_dspf35s	0	*	>Except we gave them a whole fucking country, but that still wasn't enough.   That's why.
t1_dspgxol	1	*	Concentration camps with water parks, beachfronts and shopping malls.   It's a regular Auschwitz...
t1_dspnlpp	1	*	They just were terrorists before then, and had extensive connections to terrorists after that.  They were totally good guys!
t1_dsqeicu	0	*	There is a nation called Palestine? *where*?
t1_dspdr53	1	*	It was more the US and the UN fault IMO.
t1_dspdgmh	0	*	That was more of the US and UN than the Jews. 
t1_dspenvr	1	*	>*Palestina* was *part* arab pre 1948  FTFY
t1_dsq3d12	1	*	I'm not confused but you could say when UNRWA uses UN funding to pay terrorists and their families and to purchase, build, and store weapons that they got confused about their mandate.
t1_dsoo3lg	0	*	Ok, so we're all agreed the European Union is *far* more generous than the US, right?

t1_du5a04s	0	*	Oh wow I'd never heard about this before. I don't think it's well known, at least outside of Germany?
t1_du5mi9w	0	*	> Rape is only bad if a muslim does it?  No, it's that Germany is being islamified, which includes taharrush.  See the original post I was replying to.
t1_dur71fa	0	*	Okay. 7000 / 350,000,000 = 0.002%  You were off by two orders of magnitude. And besides, one child dying in a school shooting is one too many. Im not even sure why your incorrect math matters here.
t1_dus1gba	0	*	Yeah and a lot of hunting rifles shoot 7.62x51/.308 which is also used by the military...    and fwiw AR-15's come in more than just .223... there's .300AAC, .458 SOCOM, .50 beowulf, to name a few. 
t1_durlfn0	0	*	Question. What is a more lethal firearms? Machine guns? ARs? AKs?
t1_durp8s1	0	*	Suggesting there is any nuance to american politicals is probably the funniest thing ive seen on reddit in days.  Id give you gold, but im poor. 
t1_dusdi0g	0	*	Fair enough! Of course, then maybe you shouldn't pretend to know anything about the subject, because it's painfully obvious that you don't. 
t1_durppv0	0	*	>I don't particularly care what criminals think, they'll (try to) do what they want anyway.    That's kinda the whole progun argument.
t1_dusnqaj	0	*	Pinned mags are limited, you must mean unpinned mags, which can be made at home. Either way Canada's gun laws seem to be a good balance apart from the awful classification system.
t1_durdk30	1	*	The US had more or a drop in its homicide rate without any additional gun control laws. The late 80s saw a homicide rate near 10, now were under 5.
t1_dusslja	0	*	Are dead gun nuts who willingly entered a fight, or dead innocent schoolchildren, worse to you?
t1_durpo4p	0	*	i mean the nuances fly over most americans' heads too
t1_durmrba	1	*	Living in America is definitely a ride that I couldn't explain to someone else in one sitting.
t1_duta1x0	0	*	There are plenty of countries with higher homicide rates then the US but have less gun ownership  I'm not saying that gun control equals higher homicide, I just mean that it's more complicated  
t1_durkvlo	0	*	Guns are clearly part of the problem though. If it wasnt super easy to get a gun when you snap, you wouldnt have constant mass shootings. 
t1_durencb	0	*	> It's deeply disturbing and cultish to look at from the outside  I'm sure it is. Especially when you have no idea what you're talking about.
t1_dur7d01	0	*	too soon
t1_dursvmq	1	*	Totally agree. The patriot act should have taught us why you dont gut a bill of rights amendment as an emotionl reaction to a tragedy yet here we are.
t1_duxgsxm	1	*	European politics are not the joke that American politics are.  No European country elected a clown like Trump as their Prime Minister.
t1_durh4y3	1	*	Mass shootings are so absurdly rare when compared to other problems they should be treated as local problems and news. 
t1_durbh0y	0	*	The murder rate in the US now is about half of what it was in the 80s and 90s? 
t1_dus6fbb	0	*	Please just don't. Why don't Americans just ban guns like our 200 square mile country of 7 million rich white people did?  Fuck off
t1_durmy2m	0	*	Wow, how much of America do you live in?
t1_dur7rhi	0	*	Well said. It's the same with lion attacks. 100% of the worlds lion attacks happen solely in places where there are no lions and has never been any lions.   Look it up. 100% true. Nature can't lie. 
t1_duryz83	1	*	The parliamentary system has its own shortcomings but at least we have more choice. But it generally comes down to conservative and liberal choices. Having more parties often just dilutes the pool 
t1_durn0hx	1	*	Progressivism is a world wide movement that have going on perpetually since the start of humanity. Maybe you should take an English class to realize words can have different meanings.
t1_dur7dwe	0	*	>Well when it comes to guns, 80% of them are owned by 1% of gun owners    Source?
t1_durrdum	1	*	lol his ruining that just shows how much of your life centers around american culture.

t1_durqzni	0	*	Oh, boo hoo. Try again in another four years when people have forgotten how catastrophically fucked things get when you give conservatives power. How utterly fucking destructive their agenda is.
t1_dus55gg	1	*	If that were true, we'd have a intricate understanding of the system. Sportsball is all that motivates half the country.
t1_durw2bp	0	*	Some guy ranting on Facebook is MUCH different than listening to respected world leaders. 
t1_durzple	0	*	Europeans are privy to the exact same information regarding political workings as you are
t1_duu10sc	0	*	Common sense Gun control, In my opinion, is not about banning certain TYPES of firearms.   It's about keeping ALL types of firearms out of the hands of the wrong people  
t1_duruqin	1	*	And not just guns, the shooting epidemic is so out of control they need SAM's and some lendlease Humvees.
t1_durd1vn	0	*	They question if the military personnel would use such weapons against their countrymen or if they'd refuse service. 
t1_durxacq	1	*	It depends on what you measure success by
t1_durjji5	0	*	Who should be accepting responsibility though? 
t1_dusrwzk	0	*	America is a third-world country and fast on its way to lose its global hegemony.
t1_durah82	0	*	Im perfectly fine with amendments which further restrict the power grabs and corruption of the government.
t1_duspplf	1	*	Not from Europe, mate.  And Ill talk however I like about your politics. I came to your country legally, and your first amendment says I can say whatever the fuck I want about your shiity politics.
t1_duruiyp	1	*	I prefer my hams steamed, so I will refuse to listen to what you say, sir/madam.
t1_duswrzg	1	*	>I don't hop in every thread pretending to understand shit like Brexit  Half of all brexiters in those threads are americans.
t1_durkzok	0	*	Nah, but 26 (I think theres only 26) amendments in 250 years isnt impossible
t1_dur7ib1	1	*	My ex wife used to be a tard, but she's a pilot now. 
t1_dusgql2	0	*	Oh I didnt realize The US was the only country in the world with poverty, despair, inequality and education problems. 
t1_durscbu	1	*	The answer is usually dont let it get that bad in the first place.
t1_durk1uo	0	*	That sounds sweet. How many did you manage?
t1_durrvo5	1	*	Which is less of a reduction than the world wide trend, including the halving of the us rate.  Virtually analogous NewZealand also replicated this change without port aurthur style gun control.
t1_durloe8	0	*	I thought we were still talking gun control?
t1_dus9ohi	0	*	The keeping us safe part was a bit of sarcasm.  
t1_dusl84h	0	*	Whatever? No. Not whatever. Learn what you're talking about if you want to blame the tool and make laws against them. Jesus Christ.  
t1_durjzjt	0	*	Sorry. I am partially 'tarded.   I'd like to suggest C4. Yes. That will do it. 
t1_durtj6s	1	*	As a Democrat and gun owner, I agree with this prediction.
t1_durdbhz	0	*	lol thats your argument? Two countries that the US fucked up directly because of our appetite for drugs? Theyd be better tomorrow if we stopped our failed drug war policy. 
t1_durdln3	0	*	Pretending that every school is being shot up, and every child in america is dying
t1_durl4t5	1	*	The murder rate for almost every developed country has dropped just as much as Australia. The US has gone from 8.8 to ~5 in the same time frame... So it's clearly not due to a reduction in guns. 
t1_durylc2	0	*	Would you mind to list all the countries with gun control and how they are doing? You know, Australia, UK and most of the Europe, etc. 
t1_dus07lw	1	*	But you are far less exposed to Britain, the EU, and Brexit than any of us are to America.
t1_durks40	1	*	I think Scalia just defined or redefined it.  It wasn't up to everyone. So now people take what Scalia said as what is and always must be.   We could just redefine arms again. 
t1_dus32kp	0	*	Are you saying capitalism doesn't have massive social implications?
t1_dur7odq	0	*	We removed guns from school to stop gang violence. It mostly worked, so we've got that going for us.

t1_dv3ixu0	0	*	So this just auto creates crazy?
t1_dua2lo6	0	*	Those numbers are from different incidents - such as operations in Gaza, operation Protective Shield, etc. The policy of house demolition in response to terrorism only exists for roughly 4 years.
t1_du9mgjw	1	*	Yeah.... you're missing my point 
t1_dty51co	0	*	So this whole death for apostasy and holy war talk is just ironic, huh. And the mass graves are ironic too then?
t1_dtyngaf	0	*	How does religion answer those questions? It cant prove its claims on what happens after death either.   Reincarnation, Heaven/Hell, Valhalla etc
t1_ds3nc2h	1	*	Just because you don't believe it doesn't make it untrue
t1_ds3js6s	1	*	Again, whataboutism. But good for you to derail and deflect the conversation away because it makes you uncomfortable.

t1_dui5m6b	0	*	I know LSC loves to say theyre the same thing, but killing 10% of your population is kind of a big deal.
t1_dui2zyo	0	*	It's the socialist/ fantasy that is threw out Reddit. They wanna make 250,000 a year working 3 hour 2 days a week at the local coffee shop.
t1_dui3j74	1	*	Given you can't spot a fairly obvious joke, socialising together might indeed fall flat. 
t1_duijrjo	1	*	> rent will be 33% of your income.  For Australians that only seems possible in a share house...
t1_dui6j1d	0	*	> the entire family has been working to some degree  Not only that, but the (extended) family was also living together
t1_duhzpry	0	*	> 33% of your income  or more...
t1_duhxljx	0	*	Honestly the entirety of the Harry Potter series is more likely drug fuelled hallucinations to mask Harry being abused in a paedophile ring for profit for his uncle. 
t1_dui7rrz	0	*	Phones are not a luxury. Employers expect a worker to have cell phones. Workers that don't have cell phones are at a major disadvantage. 
t1_duk5up9	1	*	Eh. Im sure corporations would be up for it for the right price.  Especially if its cheaper than lets say, colonizing the moon/Mars,
t1_duilsio	1	*	I read somewhere that Orwell predicted cameras and mics in every house, little did we know that we'd be the ones buying and installing them.
t1_dui7mcg	0	*	If these companies only cared about getting the best bang for their buck on wages, they'd have relocated to Latvia ten years ago. 
t1_dui8quy	0	*	Workers are expected to have cell phones by today's employers. It is not a luxury. 
t1_duhxtw2	0	*	Oh yeah, I forgot about that. Not everyone is cut out for that, though. Some people wouldn't last a year.
t1_dui3uf1	1	*	Not even a full century. Maybe few decades after ww2. And only in USA and Western Europe. 
t1_dui9a8k	1	*	Why does one party have to be responsible? If both individuals contributed to the problem then both of them are responsible. 
t1_dui0jfq	0	*	Might wanna raise that to 55%+ on rent and utilities.
t1_dui583w	0	*	Only when you destroy unions and demonize socialism. We had a class war starting in the late 70s. The poors lost.
t1_dui85q8	0	*	Huh, I never knew that.
t1_duiddw2	1	*	Yeah it was just her apartment had some troubles with the door locking :S which is not great haha
t1_dui56gm	1	*	The difference now though, is food is no longer an issue.  People work, but starving to death is no longer a real risk.  
t1_dui1f22	0	*	having two world wars certainly helped as well. America didn't get destroyed or anything so they could help the others rebuild while having an easy live themselves
t1_duhzww8	1	*	Well it makes sense if you look at it like it is a bottle of sex panther
t1_duj5wks	1	*	It sounds like a good time, honestly.
t1_dui164m	1	*	This is true. I think the original commenter was thinking of the nuclear family.
t1_duika86	0	*	Noticing you didn't counter with a potential positive...
t1_dui15m3	0	*	Yeah but on cheap land they owned. Today few people own enough land to live off of. 
t1_duicvcm	1	*	Trouble is, how many people realize that's what we're playing now?
t1_duimqay	0	*	Now yeah after brexit no
t1_duiekw2	1	*	This completely ignores the increases in productivity we've made.  One person can accomplish way more than ever, but our buying power isn't keeping up.
t1_dui09o5	0	*	Paying tribute to the lords is unfair because they do nothing apart of having a family name, capitalism is the solution because you don't have to pay for someone just because a paper says it.
t1_duiam55	0	*	How am I any less screwed if I gave a 10%-20% down payment?  Thank you for the explanation thus far.
t1_duij8q9	0	*	This is false. The 1% have gotten wealthier faster than the rest of society, but every income bracket has become wealthier over the past 50 years in the USA.
t1_duijooz	0	*	No because what you think happens, doesn't.
t1_duhz4sy	0	*	Well if the counties are evenly distributed and 55% of each voted one way, the result would be unanimous for that under your definition.  But in reality it's nowhere near that. 
t1_dui9wmq	0	*	Literally everything...  That's no different to living off of the parents money. If I had a magical fairy to pay my day to day living expenses, fuck me I would have a house too!

t1_dui4ef1	0	*	I can't imagine there much immigration given the unemployment rate.
t1_dui417f	0	*	In what way does a minimum wage price out workers? I'm getting a distinctly libertarian vibe from your posts.
t1_duielcc	1	*	In Poland minimal wage is around 1530 zl (after taxes). In my city (404k pop) average rent for 1 or 2 room apartment is around 1500 zl.
t1_dui2xep	1	*	No, unions rely on cooperation and solidarity.   Without it they all fail. 
t1_duie1jx	1	*	Thats $250-300 in most cities
t1_dui52lt	0	*	Except today we have the means of supporting everyone, but the few at the top just don't fucking want to share the resources everyone at the bottom has worked and been exploited for. 
t1_dui2jdm	0	*	Why not? They are both options for getting employment.  
t1_dui6kza	1	*	California isn't particular expensive outside of housing and fuel. Food, for example, is dirt cheap compared to most of the world.

t1_dtth0z5	1	*	Almost by definition, protestants and catholics can't have been murdering one another in medieval history.
t1_dtt6ji6	1	*	The Shia-Sunni divide has gotten far worse in the 20th century, unlike the Protestant-Catholic divide which has considerably softened.

t1_dtt83ul	0	*	Hey, if sex with beautiful women isnt your thing...all good
t1_dtt4esf	0	*	sounds about right
t1_dtsx887	1	*	It is tho. The electoral college selects the president in the same way the Queen selects the prime minister, a total rubber stamp. Faithless electors are toothless
t1_dtswe7d	0	*	Lol... wat?
t1_du0gisv	0	*	Is English your second language or something? Try reading over the comments and figuring it out.
t1_dtt5wtl	0	*	> As an Iranian I want dissatisfied over educated Iranians.  So what do you mean here, exactly?
t1_dtsugek	1	*	Aha. A troll. Got it.
t1_dtszw7v	0	*	It's a shame. And it sucks that others have to to suffer the main consequences, while many Americans still seem to believe the whole affair was right and justified for the most part.
t1_dtt372o	1	*	... I was talking about the Vatican
t1_dtstekb	0	*	No, that's an incredibly stupid comparison. America is a *democracy*, anyone of any race, gender, or religion can run for office; this is very *very* different from Iran
t1_dtstm69	0	*	Woman here, and no, it's not oppressive. Stop deciding things for women, kthnxbye.

t1_dtt6yw3	0	*	You hear that echo?
t1_dtt1zxm	0	*	No, that is one of the dumbest things I've ever heard. it's not modest but since it's Islam, it is modest because I say the definition is something else
t1_du1oa08	1	*	> you know ethnic cleansing means shit like the holocaust.  Ethnic cleansing is not synonymous with genocide, although it includes genocide. Kind of a muddy term. 
t1_dtsu6vf	0	*	You underestimate how controlling families of all religions can be. I'm still Christian, though :/
t1_dttn1xg	0	*	Being fired upon with a musket can be pretty upsetting
t1_dtswr4q	1	*	Okay, in that case I agree with you.
t1_dtstp1e	0	*	Afghanistan is not truly the Middle East. Its more like Central Asia. 
t1_dtt8pgu	1	*	No dont. 
t1_dtt1lm7	0	*	Uhhhh, Catholics and Protestants were killing each other a lot more recently than medieval times:  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Troubles
t1_dtt4y3s	0	*	Kind of? In the sense that they speak farsi and are the only primarily Shia country in the Middle East
t1_dtt3rsz	1	*	ok that's fine then
t1_dtta2fo	1	*	My opinion has nothing to do with it. The person I responded to said USA has had no involvement with Iran for decades. That is completely false. That's my entire point.
t1_dtsthcv	1	*	yes but even trump and the people opposing him can agree on basics like not having mandatory dress codes for women.
t1_dtt8g21	1	*	Sanctions
t1_dtu53pb	0	*	Even if you had said something mildly rational, your grammar denotes how lacking your education was.
t1_dtt7v3v	1	*	Incidentally, this led to a pretty neat rescue plan that got messed up during testing. [Operation Credible Sport](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=etzqmtYcpCQ). 
t1_dttjpvb	1	*	Al Qaida, yes. But not the Taliban. They were created from afghan refugees by Pakistan.
t1_dtsx4e5	0	*	I see that you seem to think that radicalism in the middle east has nothing to do with western interference in those regions from time. 
t1_dtsskcr	0	*	I'm not that guy nor am I Muslim but I don't.
t1_dtsyo3z	0	*	I think you misunderstood. If making a coup is so easy for the US against a resistive population, why hasn't the US converted the entire world to puppets.

t1_ds1nnm4	0	*	Yeah who needs an economy anyway. Everyone should HODL, not spend anything and everyone can be unemployed but rich on bitcoins.
t1_ds25rum	0	*	Dick Cheney circa '94 saying exactly that.  https://youtu.be/6BEsZMvrq-I
t1_ds25qtl	1	*	XRP doesnt use crytography to confirm transaction. It depends on the trust given to servers by a central authority. It shouldnt be called a cryptocurrency. Its a virtual currency, at best.
t1_ds1bkbe	1	*	Bitcoin lends itself to hoarding currency.  Also not great.
t1_dstzv2f	1	*	True but those are probably illegal. 
t1_dt1nekr	0	*	I do, but trying to pretend that everything in the world is the US's fault is retarded. Just admit that you don't want to move to those shitholes.
t1_duj29bg	0	*	and I don't think you understand how loved canada is, and how much of a dicking the rest of the world would give you for invading canada for water/resources. 
t1_dujwbh1	0	*	Yea but if you have the same volume of water, a bigger area is gonna leave more open so more will evaporate.

t1_dukd36b	1	*	It appears the news outlets are trying to downplay the race aspect.
t1_dujwop1	1	*	And so now we are expanding the oceans with other emissions.  Polluters are out there playing 5D chess.  
t1_dsrj3q7	1	*	Fair enough 
t1_dsrj5h5	1	*	Just a thought  experiment. Say the confederates went to Alaska and Alaskans were like hrmm ok, we recognise this as our government and then it became the CSA.

t1_dsehg82	0	*	Shows you how much better the Republican Party is at ramping up support/hate than the Democratic Party is. Fox News can be thanked for this phenomenon 
t1_dsf1a4g	1	*	Oh... trump kinda does it too though hahaha
t1_dset24p	1	*	Yeah, that makes sense too. He's not a subtle man.
t1_dsf9jne	1	*	Bush handled the 9/11 attacks spectacularly well. It's hard to imagine a president handling them any better in the months after the attacks.  It's when the topic turns to Iraq that Bush gets bad. 
t1_dsetmb8	0	*	I have no idea what you're talking about but I am very interested
t1_dsfcbl4	0	*	I see Trump is noticeably absent from that list.
t1_dsf9uxy	1	*	Within the company/government/whatever they work for? Yes.  Nothing is unethical about dating outside of that, though. Jesus fucking Christ you people.

t1_dsercbi	1	*	I'm assuming that September 2001 poll was conducted *after* 9/11 when the country had much bigger things to worry about?

t1_dsfx2lp	0	*	I guess the counter argument that he should not be involved in shit that he would have to lie about lol 
t1_dsfl788	1	*	I don't think that reason was racism.  The republican party of today isn't even the same as in the 90's.  They've gone completely batshit.

t1_dtvwoqj	0	*	I seriously doubt that. 
t1_dtv4l5y	0	*	And also that, so long as the danger is just to yourself, doing something unsafe shouldn't be illegal.  For instance, it's not illegal to cut your own arm off.
t1_dtvauy0	1	*	Smoking weed 20 minutes before driving isn't safe. Testing people and busting them for weed they smoked two days ago is fucking bullshit.
t1_dtvawkg	0	*	I can agree it's less dangerous. Doesn't make it safe. And that was my only point, that it's not safe.
t1_dtxash0	1	*	Explains a lot

t1_ds7ryx8	0	*	The Mighty Chinchilla has spoken!
t1_ds7tnxx	1	*	It will be sold at the prevailing market price as all oil is which means it will not be any cheaper to buy as an American   This^
t1_ds7p4fq	0	*	Understanding aerosol can operation is literally science for 4th graders. It doesnt need experimentation. The design has been around for over 225 years.
t1_ds7o5a8	0	*	And they won't have to spend as much on oil because they won't be transporting it so far.
t1_ds7qfar	1	*	Lol whoops typo sorry 
t1_ds840l9	0	*	There is enough information available to properly look it up.
t1_ds7v70n	0	*	Bok bwaaack  /Chicken chick
t1_ds7o3lm	0	*	Also less fuel means less fuel to burn which will burn less fuel.
t1_ds7ulul	0	*	Can't tell if Trump troll or somebody who wants people to be angrier about Trump and demand something be done.
t1_ds7lw92	1	*	Yep, It was supply shock, but it maintains the point that we are demand capped.
t1_ds90c5b	1	*	Oh boy
t1_ds7jstk	1	*	Good gawd, I felt that one from here.
t1_ds7s8rt	1	*	Good luck convincing anyone he knows that CFCs are pretty much phased out, much less that he even knows what they are....
t1_ds7ppct	1	*	Also since tankers operate in international waters they burn shitty fuel full of sulfur and they don't care what they drain into the water
t1_ds7ivfo	0	*	Fucking spambots
t1_ds8dhnt	0	*	Just feel like you're missing the point still. Not like the problem is the shipping of the oil it's that we are in need of oil.
t1_ds7jatx	0	*	If it was occuring too slowly, it wouldn't be repairing, it would be increasing.  We would have a bigger hole today than prior....
t1_dsa4smk	0	*	and yet makes no sense here. I said they DIDN'T follow procedure. It's simple: follow procedure, and the environment is fine.
t1_ds7oxof	1	*	Using facts?
t1_ds7kgxs	0	*	Yes, I Agree.
t1_ds7vo6x	0	*	Something else with intelligence and individual thought would rise up instead of humanoids imo.
t1_ds7osl1	1	*	Hitler and Stalin have been less troublesome since they died decades ago.
t1_ds8xira	1	*	This is what I meant. Thanks for clarifying. 
t1_ds7mv5t	0	*	Umm can't I lump them all in the same shit pile?
t1_ds7mulw	0	*	Was not expecting that. You, sir, are funny.
t1_ds7mgzz	1	*	as long as we figure out potable water sources for the world. I'm trying to be positive but I really think we're already fracked. Wait till the water wars start. Along with the famine migrations. 
t1_ds9b81i	0	*	Are you not in favor of providing evidence for claims? Is that not what science is all about?
t1_ds8bhw3	1	*	The speed is the issue though. Change will come but change (even extreme) we can survive. What will kill us is rate of change. 
t1_ds7tn7j	1	*	It will be sold at the prevailing market price as all oil is which means it will not be any cheaper to buy as an American   This^
t1_ds8s11g	1	*	Worst case scenario we all live in a self-sustaining underground bunker. 
t1_ds7lb20	1	*	Part of me thinks you really don't understand generalized speaking habits and that you're not being pedantic. But then I remembered I'm on Reddit. 
t1_ds83yzt	0	*	I must be new? Telling someone to look it up used to be praise, that is old homie 
t1_ds7mwdu	1	*	I'm pretty sure I worded it wrong but you get the picture right?  Fuggedaboutit.
t1_dt8deqb	0	*	The EU [does not](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal) have a larger economy and it is also about to lost 1/6 of it's economy in two years. 
t1_duiesi3	0	*	Yes, circumcision involves chopping off the foreskin, which is pretty clearly a form of mutilation
t1_dukyeqi	0	*	No, *you* apparently disagree with that opinion, not most people.
t1_duiq0ge	1	*	Thank you for reminding me what pity feels like. 
t1_duirvad	0	*	They'll just have to leave the country or give up their barbaric practice. Circumcision must end.
t1_duie0hx	0	*	> A ludicrously small percentage of circumcised males cannot orgasm due to complications.  Ridiculoulsy small part of Iceland's populations are religious Jews.  
t1_dueelz5	0	*	> unless you compare it to previous popes.  Nope, that is not the claim the above commenter made. 
t1_duex0p4	0	*	He said a ton of shady shit not a ton of cover ups of child abuse.   I was asking for examples of the shady things he accused the church of doing.
t1_duemhcf	0	*	Catholic doctrine isnt based on the Old Testament. And you literally cherry picked that comment. There was a very purposeful indication of sarcasm. 
t1_due7hxx	0	*	Bo Burnham's Perspective of God comes to mind.   Didn't think I had to right that down for you. Just don't fucking rape people. 
t1_dug6jlq	0	*	That's the only point you've come to make? I must really be onto something...
t1_due9f5f	1	*	Yes you do know rabbis diddle little boys and its ok to bang underage boys in the muslim faith right ? 
t1_duef6r6	1	*	Lol maybe if they ever directly outlaw guns, and even then I doubt he'd actually do anything. 
t1_duzm9l8	1	*	Google pterodactyl hunting if you want an idea of what Canadian anti-gun people are like.  It would be hilarious if it wasn't so sad
t1_duy89kb	0	*	Nobody buys an AR to protect his house from the military. 
t1_duyaxu7	0	*	That might be the case outside of Norway and sweden, but acting ignorant and claiming that its gibberish is BS
t1_duxi4ra	0	*	Theyd sit in a garage with the car running if guns are banned. You think suicides will go down because gun ownership goes down? 
t1_dv0jfm4	0	*	What I did? You mean take the paranoid 'theme' of your 'this is just step 1' post one step further into outright paranoia?
t1_duxoriz	0	*	I'm not saying we are better off for it, but that tragedy has caused us to be OK with giving up constitutional rights in the past. When people are scared they are more prone to take drastic measures.
t1_duyeica	0	*	So how many legal semi-autos were used in violent crimes in Norway in 2017?
t1_duxuozt	1	*	Great point, i think you are definitely right
t1_duyn436	0	*	Fuck off with that ignorance, have you ever been to Germany? They are some of the most ethical people I've ever come across, almost to a fault. 
t1_duyy2gt	0	*	Driving, having kids, eating and consuming news are all important for society to function properly. Owning guns is not. That's the difference.
t1_duyr2u5	0	*	If you're a politician that lobbies for fossil fuels or fight against universal healtcare, what the fuck do we need a judge and jury for?   We only need an executioner for that scum.  Well said OP!
t1_duz56ox	0	*	So? That's not relevant, is it. Not that the types of ammunition you can use for hunting isn't also regulated here anyway.
t1_duxpl3q	0	*	> US makes it fourth on the list for highest murder rate.  That's... not even close to being correct.
t1_duyb9kz	0	*	To put down a tyrannical government.
t1_duy000o	0	*	Some time ago.
t1_duyk1be	0	*	Europe has plenty of examples where the government got out of control and did some pretty horrendous things to an unarmed populous though.
t1_duyfsnr	0	*	The military would splinter like it always has in such scenarios. 
t1_dv2kxd1	1	*	Personally I'd recommend an AR with a few 40 rd mags, but you might find something better for your situation after your research.
t1_duyr9c8	0	*	I do not? Aha. Nice assumption.  Anyway, thats irrelevant for the point made.
t1_duxpsn7	0	*	Interesting. Im curious if you believe in right to die? A trend gaining steam in europe where doctors will let the fatally depressed patient off themselves legally.
t1_duyqujq	1	*	When the people that make up society deem it unsuitable for public use then it's a no brainer. It has nothing to do with the bogeyman 'big brother government' you nut jobs are always going on about
t1_duyi4iz	1	*	Yup, and i completely feel the same way my dude.
t1_duxtd1z	0	*	You ever hunt hogs or coyotes? Ever had multiple intruders break in? Having had all that happen, I'm thankful to have had semi-autos
t1_dv1ele0	0	*	One has third world murder rates, the other does not. Australian reduction rates are not fast enough for Americas situation.
t1_duxnuny	0	*	Yo criminal hold on one sec while i unlock my gun safe.     Quick draw holster? That's some bullshit cause officers use holsters with multiple forms of retention.  Safety mode haha  
t1_duygtc5	0	*	https://prague.tv/en/s72/Directory/c214-Business/n11798-Gun-amendment-fails-in-Senate  Yeah, failed in the Senate. 
t1_duyrq6k	0	*	You do know the Bataclan attack was during a concert? I seriously doubt someone would be let into a concert venue with a weapon, even in US
t1_duy88mp	0	*	The guns arent to fight the government. 
t1_duxymuu	0	*	>I prefer living in a country where we don't even need to have armed cops.  Then in that case you should be like Japan and almost completely close your borders.
t1_duyr4qv	1	*	It's funny until it isn't.
t1_duxn206	0	*	Looked it up and thought you might want to know: He later apologized to Cheney for being shot by him.
t1_duyg47q	0	*	Says the person that says that firearm owners are all going to fight for tyranny. I wonder if youre actually that stupid or a troll. You have to be a troll. 
t1_duydrlp	1	*	Having heard your speak president, it's clear that many cheeseburgers have been brainwashed.
t1_duyihmd	0	*	LOl that's so stupid because that would only make more enemies. 
t1_duyi3dp	0	*	We have modern examples of when armed individuals were able to successfully resist the American armies.  Look at Iraq and Afghanistan; guerilla warfare can be highly effective against large armies.
t1_duz35zs	1	*	How has that worked out, historically?
t1_duyy0qy	0	*	Should never in a civilized society*
t1_duyhfb9	0	*	You do realize that you can literally dismiss pretty much anything you own as not being necessary?   
t1_dv00llg	1	*	Yeah but idiots always exist... and idiots are more likely to commit crimes... so why do you think a law banning objects will stop criminals already committing worse crimes?
t1_duz91sy	1	*	So if it is way less deadly, why would you want to ban them and not the more powerful rifles?
t1_duybfta	0	*	An ideologue is someone who can't understand where the other person is coming from. I think I understand where you're coming from, you seem to think I'm evil and/or stupid.
t1_duyqtgp	1	*	> their big brother government can tell them they aren't trustworthy  That's not how it is though. One can tell that the population isn't trustworthy just by watching the evening news.
t1_duxjfo6	0	*	So, evil. That's the flip side of insane, and also very a very misinformed picture. Your political opponents are neither crazy nor evil. They have different values than you.
t1_duyaa2y	1	*	Is this a parody? I hope it's a parody. 
t1_du8zxnx	0	*	good grief man. sure its not 4.16 million? ffs, rounding is a normal and common thing. surely you are aware of this, right?
t1_du9jfis	0	*	Great job countering anything else I said 
t1_ds9ql8q	0	*	Why should it be all or nothing? We be reasonable people and keep the good, reject the bad.
t1_ds9o0jx	0	*	* Blasphemy against religion. * Disparaging the German state and its symbols. * Writings that trivialize or glorify violence. (How long until they ban Game of Thrones?) 
t1_dsbwpp3	1	*	Are you pretending to be an english speaker right now? Funny stuff
t1_dsad35y	0	*	The GOP huffed and buffed on expelling him from the senate and then they STFU about it only to fund his campaign. 
t1_ds9nsci	0	*	You can't speak freely, but that doesn't mean they banned free speech!
t1_dsa3uhf	0	*	WikiLeaks trying to get people in the Whitehouse to leak is their job.
t1_ds9o7ih	0	*	That's just a few items on that list. Did you miss insults, disparaging the government, blasphemy, and pornographic writings? The fact that laws are arbitrarily enforced doesn't make this any better.
t1_dsbmawj	0	*	Who gets to determine what constitutes deliberate misinformation?
t1_ds9oz4y	0	*	Their lack of self awareness is amazing, it's as if they never learned from that whole Nazi episode.
t1_dsad393	0	*	Said the teen edgelord on reddit.  by god this is pathetic.
t1_dtl6pv3	1	*	Toenails are where it's at. Thicker nails, stronger bouquet. Qualities that lead to a superior product!
t1_dtk0hws	1	*	Reminds me of Taiwanese. 
t1_dtjmueq	0	*	And many Americans ignore science even with education. They believe evolution is a theory and that God created everything.
t1_dtjsu29	1	*	I see what you did there
t1_dtk5n7x	1	*	It's not organic gmo free rhino horn man.
t1_dtjnieb	0	*	yeah but that's dumb 
t1_dtjnk9q	1	*	And anti-vaxxers...
t1_dtjpf4z	0	*	84 vs 1.  I'm okay with it. 
t1_dtk8kx2	1	*	99% real = 100% fake     Why not set up some farms to raise Rhino.    The animal can survive well.    The highest expense is to hire snipers to keep poachers away.
t1_dtjm0s8	0	*	> Even people with access to education and western medicine take stupid remedies.  That just makes them stupid, too.
t1_dtjr8xd	1	*	lmfao
t1_dtkosa0	0	*	Kowloon, NTs and HK island are all on the same deal. Their guarantees from the Patten deal expire at the same time (2047), as their 99 year leases are all from the same date. That expired in 1997.
t1_dstflq0	0	*	Thats a lotta SNUKES bro
t1_dstnjda	0	*	Can't attack my comment so you attack me. Thanks.
t1_dstdl9r	0	*	I would totally buy the Demons from Hell collection of Funko.    Hell, anyone know if there are hellraiser Funko? 
t1_dstfjrm	1	*	I think he's having a stroke.
t1_dsti85c	1	*	Fookin laser sights
t1_dstrznm	1	*	{-}7
t1_dsuq2n1	0	*	I've never heard of this. So if it is not a de facto dictatorship then who are these people who actually run it? It's not like they have giant corporations running things.
t1_dstf5w7	0	*	Then the Olympics as a whole are a sham and they should not be celebrated if their contests led to this. I don't see it happening but in any case I don't watch the Olympics
t1_dsu6r5w	1	*	That video was an obvious fake, IMO.
t1_dsthqaa	1	*	Both.  He is too stupid to realize he is how evil he is.
t1_dsui2ud	1	*	Sacks of rice, for show, not for eating. And lifting.
t1_dstf7vb	1	*	That sub needs more content.
t1_dsthroh	0	*	Whoosh!
t1_dsteuyw	0	*	My work is done!
t1_dstna1j	0	*	Touchxe9! *points+whispers* Gulag..
t1_dstd0w8	0	*	How so?  I in no way implied he runs the country.
t1_dstoqrz	1	*	well holy shit, you just solved the paradox
t1_dstfwze	1	*	Who said anything about the world, we're talking about a corrupt communist country. It's quite clear that the power is beyond the supreme leader
t1_dstfy8t	1	*	The Twitter-Reddit Pipeline

t1_dtl8xsa	0	*	Im sure the Kuwaitis and Bosniaks appreciated our help.
t1_dtlnvh1	0	*	Occupied *while the military helped rebuild.*  Iraq and Afghanistan still don't have basic infrastructure. 
t1_dtl0co1	1	*	I know, I was stationed at one of them for 5 years.  You also forgot Korea in the aftermath of the Korean war.
t1_dt76p54	0	*	I aint going to believe your truth or honesty until you give me a reliable source.
t1_ds3cuyb	1	*	Hes not my president, Im from the UK.
t1_ds2yn6l	0	*	Naming and shaming might be an improvement.

t1_ds34wgy	1	*	Wonder why the US gov didn't ask our great allies in Pakistan to go arrest Bin Ladin instead of having to send the SEAL teams in.  That's right, they can't be trusted.
t1_dtlwo3e	0	*	Fuzzy llama, Funny llama,
t1_dskuqui	0	*	I was in Iraq and Trashcanistan for 3 years. I do not need a degree in memeology to tell you that both countries are shitholes. 
t1_dskxfwz	1	*	Wow. Weird how different everyone's perspective of temperature is. 
t1_dssrk3p	1	*	The light in the blue room.
t1_dst4ast	1	*	Happy cake day
t1_dsssm9g	0	*	Cymru? Or Gymru?
t1_dstnw3s	1	*	This is fantastic
t1_dssdufa	0	*	Hey here in Texas they shut down all the schools in the area because it was supposed to sleet.  It didnt.  Dry & sunny all day. Cold, but dry & sunny.
t1_dsspdmf	1	*	I do like the rain, so it's not an issue with me. Little annoying at times, especially with the wind, but usually not too much of an issue. 
t1_dst1dbe	1	*	10C Tshirt and jeans? That's absurd
t1_dstleco	1	*	A deadly laser
t1_dsswnul	1	*	Strange light phenomenon is a rough translation of what the locals call it where I live.
t1_dst066o	1	*	People here think that I must like cold weather simply because I'm white.  Nope.  Hot and dry is perfect for me.
t1_dsssffp	0	*	> My assbone still hurts.   This guy snowboards. 
t1_dsspbye	1	*	I speak no Welsh! You'd think that I'd pick up some (Living in Cardiff, Welsh is plastered everywhere) but I know exactly 0 words. 
t1_dssucd4	0	*	Lol... you cant be serious. 
t1_dss75fj	0	*	The evil day star
t1_dssv5r6	0	*	More water dude. Florida here, I have to drink so much friggin water or I get mad headaches in the sun.
t1_dssl4me	1	*	I think you can still have a scientific understanding of it though
t1_dsstxpy	1	*	My Finnish ex couldn't deal with the damp cold in Scotland. Said she preferred Finnish weather!
t1_dssmk6r	0	*	Move to the Pacific northwest, England, or Scandinavia.  Or Dunedin, NZ.  You'll flip your fortunes and only have to experience the sun a handful of days out of the year.
t1_dstfnu2	0	*	Going underground doesn't make it much warmer if the planet doesn'y have a magnetic field.
t1_dstg879	0	*	Ouch! Texas to Liverpool has got to be a shock.  What do you do, if you don't mind me asking? (I'm assuming it's a work related move!) 
t1_dssx8ro	1	*	Sounds like you need to change the batteries.
t1_dstdob2	1	*	You don't have to believe, it's true if you do or do not believe!
t1_dstuqwq	1	*	I remember that! Our elementary school in f*cking Shawinigan was doing the same with african kids. How do you explain ''snow days'' to someone who's never seen snow? 
t1_dssnxvs	1	*	I agree with you! Went to uk for university and wow I love the weather.
t1_dssdxmk	1	*	yeah, thats 50*F - definitely tshirt weather!
t1_dss3yql	1	*	whats funny its when it goes from -5 to -20 during the day and you are in your hoodie.

t1_dssdujw	0	*	No. Please. I would burn like a vampire given Spain's level of insolation.
t1_dtnb35r	0	*	Not for Germans, very stubborn lot. If you want them to change their minds on something you need to bomb the country to a crisp 
t1_dsdn5gr	0	*	Go walk around some city slums and tell me how many people you see that don't look native to you sir and or mam.
t1_dsdr88s	1	*	I admit nothing, I just accepted the premise. And I can easily comprehend why he was. Many guys with cameras are chased off. As they should be. Few things are as annoying as idiots with cameras.
t1_dsdmyul	1	*	...Except in this case.
t1_dsoibok	1	*	A ramp just makes a heavy barrel heavier. They used pulleys and a wooden elevator system most likely.
t1_dsp2ozs	0	*	More assumptions, when will it end!    The actions of few do not represent all. That's all I'll say and I'll leave you at that.

t1_dso7lvn	0	*	Please educate yourself and it wont be necessary.

t1_dso6xft	0	*	Good question. Are there any Karlings left hanging around these days?
t1_dsny1kq	1	*	Except he wasn't.  He tried once and basically bounced off the guys, then started talking again.  It was WAY after that he was tazed.
t1_dso636q	1	*	Yeah, agreed.
t1_dsrxl5b	1	*	I don't think you know enough about me to care either way, but ok

t1_dso0clq	0	*	I just googled it.  Tons of stories. 
t1_dsny2pn	0	*	My point is physical violence is not a reasonable response to verbal annoyance.  Do you have a point or are you just going to insult me?
t1_dsnxbqs	1	*	Read it in his voice and I giggled.
t1_dsnyk7d	1	*	 Well there's your problem, you thought wrong. 
t1_dso3ta9	0	*	So he doesn't hate Norwegians enough? You realize immigrants don't transplant their home government/economic systems onto ours when they come here, right? 
t1_dsoe09d	0	*	Oops did you forget that Hillary won the popular vote?

t1_dsnxp3x	1	*	Me too! I cant get enough
t1_dsnwrf4	0	*	I got that impression through reading the rest of your responses. In fact one of them was even complaining about downvotes, as if you couldn't be any more of a spastic.
t1_dso44sy	0	*	Well he kind of has a point?  If Norway needed to raise a military, that would be a lot of money...
t1_dso2lli	0	*	Private travel... on public roads.
t1_dso4e0q	1	*	Good point. He probably just brought an American flag, presented it during a live stream, and said that to make conversation. 
t1_dso0sfi	0	*	So?
t1_dsnzxis	0	*	They share his views on the 2nd amendment or they are wealthy, those are basically the two categories of his supporters

t1_dsp0t79	1	*	I am defending myself...in favor of THAT.
t1_dsnwvxp	1	*	For the various bullshit they do like being better than us in shocker and putting sauce on Schnitzel.  Especially the sauce on schnitzel part it is.   Fucking sauce. On. Schnitzel. Was zum fick.

t1_dsod20e	0	*	You got caught fucking up sweetie. Just pull out. 
t1_dsnynyh	1	*	Yeah, I agree with you there. Maybe we can learn to not blindly hate because of being unhappy with our current situation. It's not helping the situation.
t1_dso77f8	1	*	Did you read the comments he was replying too? Serious levels of smug there
t1_dsomvva	0	*	You look it up. I don't even need to bother sourcing my claims because they're so obviously true.
t1_dso5z7o	1	*	It's great. Ian hislop, one of the team captains is known as the 'most sued man ever' due to the number of times his magazine has been sued. I think he wins by far the vast majority of cases.

t1_dsnzh8a	0	*	Sure it'd be nice to have control over the $100 federal taxes eat of every pay check but I don't complain too much. Everyone's gotta pay

t1_dso05wv	1	*	You do know it's perfectly legal to request a senior officer at a scene.  Although this guys excuse for it is hilarious at best.
t1_dso9oqe	0	*	Well how'd you become king then?
t1_dsnvl6l	0	*	Did you forget Boris Johnson was mayor before Khan?
t1_dso69x2	0	*	No. People emigrate. 'Immigrate' is from the perspective of the place to which they're moving.
t1_dso3iih	0	*	**I always do.
t1_dsny12d	1	*	Spot on.  Law is big, and lawyers are not magic.  When it comes to the real nitty-gritty stuff, I wouldn't necessarily trust a lawyer unless that area was their exact specialty.

t1_dso8hb1	0	*	No because level headed people don't burn their house down to spite their wife right? Level headed, considerate people would not do that.
t1_dso48if	1	*	We're cool. I didn't publish that as a rebuttal. I published that as a clarification of your comments.

t1_dsnxc87	1	*	Please, go ahead and disprove their link. It counters the exact claims you posted. A good place to start.  Edit: Got nothing. Only a down vote.  Edit 2: and a shitty edit.
t1_dso29q1	0	*	I love the aside in Night Watch about the neighbors fighting over a hedge. That whole book lays out the Vimes philosophy of policing so well.

t1_dso2n6x	1	*	Thats rough. Sorry to hear that.
t1_dsnwj5m	0	*	Not accepting them into your country is being a twat? If Oxford doesn't accept me is it because they are twats or is it because I'm not qualified to be there?

t1_dso46ey	1	*	Well, if you always prefer the views of candidate X and not candidate Y - which is what is tests - it would make sense to vote for candidate X.  Except, yaknow, candidate X is diddly-doodling kids.

t1_dsxpt66	1	*	>Rationally argue against more rights for people (that do not violate other people's rights, so obviously no free stealing or violence).  Free speech? Triggered?
t1_dsiwutd	1	*	No. I recognize that you are part of the propaganda campaign and fear mongering crowd.   I recognize the standard script that you people use.  That is what I recognize. 
t1_dv6t2qu	0	*	We have that much tech along every section of a hundred-mile-plus pipeline? What if it goes down?
t1_dv60jwr	1	*	You don't understand the point of diversification.  It means we won't _need_ the pipelines. Eventually. But the sooner we start, the sooner that's true. One has very little to do with the other.
t1_dtf9lkt	0	*	Woah, there were only 3 presidents who were good enough to get two terms? Is that correct?

t1_du51wvk	1	*	Could be. It's not the simplest thing. But the Human Rights violations and genocide have been verified by the UN, which does mean something.
t1_du6g7qn	0	*	If you look back in the thread you'd see we're talking about the threat of getting nuked, not border skirmishes that you have in mind. Your comments don't relate to the topic at hand here.
t1_du4x4jo	1	*	Honestly China is some weird hybrid of capitalist and command economy.  It is a bit weird. 
t1_du4zpu6	1	*	You're willfully trying not to understand.
t1_du5bmy9	1	*	> It's South Korea's soverign right to decide what they want to do.  Which I did not dispute.

t1_du56095	1	*	So then why say it all? I'm not accusing you of anything, but the only purpose your comment would serve is to distract from a current dictators awfulness. 
t1_du604uj	1	*	Korea's unification will allow SK to have nuclear weapons. They'll have the technology and won't be seen as bad guys.

t1_dsxsqd8	1	*	dont really follow sorry mate this is about dolphins 
t1_dsxfme1	0	*	Having opposable thumbs is not at all the same thing as being smart. It lets you do cool things, but it is not a measure of intelligence.
t1_dsx4pou	0	*	Oh, because animals don't over hunt their areas?  Animals don't use up resources.  I forgot about all those conservationist animal groups banning hunting in areas to repopulate their hunting grounds
t1_dsxizxj	1	*	> But yeah, it's me not using logic.  Agreed.

t1_dsx4zza	0	*	Realistically, it was probably the first book they *chose themselves* to read. Not the literal first.
t1_dsxeamu	1	*	You need to do some research before making stupid comments. Ignorance doesnt look good on you. 
t1_dsx53af	0	*	Hahaha, this book is still hard to read as an adult. It's so.. Bizarre. 
t1_dsxx847	1	*	It's okay, it's a pretty emotional topic so I can understand. 
t1_dsy9zxw	0	*	This is literally what the Aquarium will be doing...

t1_dsx5my4	0	*	Mine, after Dr Zeuss, was Charlotte's Web.  Some Pig.  After that it was some Roald Dahl, The Rats of Nimh, and then The Borribles. Also some Willard Price.  Amazing books

t1_duycdc3	1	*	What he said isn't true. Its all about the accent. Its like british and american accent. 
t1_du6vk5l	0	*	There was no mistake. We took it. Greeks don't belong to Asia and English don't belong to America.  You need to be removed.

t1_duuegsj	0	*	In hindsight, the line they were an inspiration to us all takes on a more sinister meaning coming from the fuhrer.  
t1_duu0snp	0	*	It's weird how you're rooting for China, Russia and NK.
t1_duvd7h9	0	*	I'm not talking about actually making jokes. I'm talking about one country treating its closest neighbour and ally like GARBAGE. 
t1_duts1gh	0	*	Eh, we'll just promote some other coastal city after.

t1_dv59459	0	*	Ah yes... I'll just take a 5 hour train ride and the bike 20 minutes before and after that to get to work. 12 hours of travel to and from work sounds reasonable.

t1_dumjy7d	1	*	I heard about that, I should have specified that I never heard of the girfts from China.
t1_dum5ggd	1	*	Of course but there is still a difference between gained independence and never conquered. 
t1_dum2648	0	*	You realize they have different meanings right?   you really love to down vote :P
t1_dum81np	1	*	How would you describe forced organ harvesting in your own words? I think mass murder is putting it lightly.  Go ahead, try to deny it.
t1_du6gw6l	1	*	Yeah, oxygen, water, and sugar are all prescribed in hospitals as well.  Does that make them drugs?

t1_dslvgpa	0	*	I disagree. You should accept that you may stay incarcerated despite the law change but a just society should pardon those who have committed victimless crimes.

t1_dt3lk4z	0	*	Have you seen the drivers in Delaware? Its not an option.
t1_dt38q3a	0	*	Calling Bud Light beer is an insult to beer, it tastes like Satan's piss if his dick was made out of pennies.
t1_dt3aazd	1	*	Ah, well if your definition of ethnic cleansing is anyone that dies in war then there's ethnic cleansing in literally every war ever.
t1_dt3cn9t	0	*	I'll say it again in a more complex summary: that guy who wrote that report is an antisemit and a revisionist, and he was fired from the UN. Good enough for ya?

t1_dt5dfxz	1	*	As sad as it is, Australia can't solve the worlds problems - and where do you draw the line? Why reward people who risk their children's lives by trying to enter illegally by boat?
t1_dt3ilwx	0	*	We have that too, it just so happens that people consider it racist to border another country. 
t1_dt3q8ck	0	*	They are compatible. Not sure why youd say they arent.  And no. Take in only the immigrants we stand to gain from is quite ugly.
t1_dt3il3l	1	*	That's not how laws or nations work though. 
t1_dt41kur	0	*	Its not illegal for a refugee to enter a country by any means. When are people going to stop repeating that lie.
t1_dt5db7l	0	*	Or rather Hey maybe don't pretend to be a refugee when you are nothing more than an economic migrant trying to illegally get into a better country..
t1_dt3djoc	1	*	they're murders those things from shithole oceans, killed steve irwin, true story a kangaroo told me, I'm good friends with the kangaroos, all the animals of australia agree with me

t1_dt380hm	1	*	This guy saw a screening. Pack it in everybody. 
t1_dt40jcu	0	*	It is Israeli law in the settlements and PA law elsewhere...
t1_dt50dec	1	*	So the palestinians started a war, lost their land as a result, and israel's at fault here?

t1_dt3kz1x	1	*	You killed Ted you medieval dickweed!
t1_dt65e8o	1	*	That's because Israel likes to play the victim card. They don't want anyone to forget the Holocaust, yet they've seemingly learned nothing from it themselves.  That's a special sort of hypocrisy.
t1_dt3gex6	0	*	Isn't Delaware just a highway?
t1_dt3cabf	0	*	> the majority of whom were ethnically cleansed upon the zionist declaration of statehood  Citation fucking needed.

t1_dt5qqfb	1	*	Thanks mate, you encapsulated a lot of my frustration.
t1_dt32yoz	0	*	Get some rest. And thank you. If that's the case then the pilots, while well meaning, are not helping anyone.
t1_dt3pcs5	0	*	Still, killing civilians with rockets and tunnels while disregarding their own people. And the AP with their apartheid against their Christians. Not such a simple comparison.
t1_dt3e57o	0	*	Are you trying to argue that genocide, detention camps and racist immigration policies are okay because it's been done in the past or...?  I mean this is happening Right Now.
t1_dt7c3wo	0	*	That's in the Old Testament, and that's a document that is very unreliable. We don't know exactly what's fact or what's fiction.

t1_ds6epub	0	*	No, it inverses your computer's sexual gender preference. 
t1_ds6ghz5	0	*	really? the guy says zuckerberg's a socialist when zuck-zuck is a billionaire and you *don't* think he has no idea what socialism is? maybe you should spend some time with a dictionary as well.
t1_ds6cpra	0	*	A 'meme' that directly incites violence towards a vulnerable group of people. 
t1_ds8vygg	1	*	Nope, which is why I'm not a Bernie supporter, and it's also why I said simple terms
t1_ds6u1fl	0	*	> If you work for a privately owned company, it's happening.  My own company, so... I'm assuming not, then?  Like I said; I'm an outlier.
t1_ds6efmm	0	*	The statement that private entities can do what they want don't hold in cases of monopolies. They have too much power for free market rules to apply.
t1_ds6f1lj	0	*	Twoxchromosomes banned me for commenting on other subreddits they didn't like. Never even commented there
t1_ds6grwl	0	*	They really are a monopoly.
t1_ds6gyhf	0	*	You surely can't call under appreciated comment just 5 minutes after the comment. Not time for it to be appreciated, blew your load too early. 
t1_ds6q3qd	0	*	How is the share of the company divvied up?  
t1_ds6f8wu	0	*	Significant influence? Do you have any sources?
t1_ds6elqo	0	*	I'd argue it would be dystopian and totalitarian to force a private company to host messages they disagree with. 
t1_ds7i9bh	0	*	all I see is someone trying to justify not being able to read and understand a short comment  so, what is it you do hear exactly?
t1_ds6ek4h	1	*	I haven't been on leftypol in probably a year. Did it take a big downfall?
t1_ds8f62d	1	*	> LOL just LOL  I meekly bow to the master of rhetoric.
t1_ds6bzan	0	*	Well considering your sources do not support your claim, I think it is you who failed to make even a token effort.
t1_ds73bre	0	*	Having a Facebook account is most certainly voluntary.
t1_ds6d9il	1	*	I don't think jokes should be punished. I'm pointing out that calling it benign is utter bullshit.
t1_ds6p2am	1	*	Bravo
t1_ds6fjah	1	*	I think that *any* speculation about such a large demographic is likely to mislead us. Conventional wisdoms about the political leanings of young people or web site administrators are often misguided.
t1_ds6pq92	0	*	Ah yes, a bunch of paragraphs without context or any links. Of fucking course they get it wrong, of course they lean, but to lump them all in a meme. Psh, have fun with that.
t1_ds6dux0	0	*	Asking people either to behave civilly or leave is not fascism.
t1_ds6dfjg	1	*	Remember when Germany dictated Jews complaining as hate speech that invites disorder
t1_ds6dzey	0	*	Isnt that adorable. Or perhaps its just the least productive members of society that have the time to do that shit that are commenting, and the rest of us are actually working.
t1_ds6fevs	1	*	Or /bt/ because youre a minor and boobs.
t1_ds6chpy	0	*	*Q: Do you have something against immigrants? A: Yes, machine pistols and hand grenades!*    Wow, pretty benign criticism of migrant policy indeed.
t1_ds6ee2g	0	*	He didn't say /pol/ wasn't right wing, he just said it's a tumor that doesn't reflect the views of the rest of the site.
t1_ds6pfp7	0	*	I'm not sure how that refutes my point, so I can't explain it.
t1_ds6ep3t	1	*	Well, if Facebook or any other company agreed with you they could do just that.   Boom. Now everyone is happy.  Also criticism isn't being censored. Hatespeech as defined by German law is.
t1_ds6ow2i	1	*	That makes a lot of sense, sorry. Food for thought, either way.
t1_ds7l5x6	0	*	Magnitsky Act doesn't come with a gag order, does it?  Facebook should have no problem explaining the difference, so why don't they?
t1_ds6cdtk	0	*	Let's gas all the Jews!   \*gets sentenced for inciting the masses\*   B-but it was just a meme, guys!  
t1_ds6mulp	0	*	I would agree that incentives and pressure shouldn't be put in the same bucket.  I was meaning more from the: We will take away previous incentives angle
t1_ds6era6	0	*	Literally 90% of the site since its heyday has been girls with dicks and discussion about how traps arent gay, how the fuck is that right wing outside of /pol
t1_ds6ckii	0	*	Some memes just aren't funny. I get her potential frustration with the refugees, but this was not a good joke.
t1_ds6ikul	1	*	Pretty soon marketers are going to put pictures of the people using the computer in the ad to get their attention
t1_ds6edx9	0	*	Yeah. Same for socialism.
t1_ds6fe1c	1	*	I mean /b/ is expected madness, it IS the origin point of where the cesspool springs forth, which is fine.

t1_ds6fuh7	0	*	Well of course lobbying works, it's literally trying to get politicians on your side. Both of us could lobby if we wanted to.   Lobbying is not the same as bribery though. 
t1_ds6g1xy	0	*	Haha oh why thank you. we were hoping it would have a motivational effect. Science is great, no matter the domain, and I think people are starting to come back to appreciating it more!
t1_ds73tti	0	*	Nothing wrong with a pee fetish but those videos are questionable content for kids to be watching.
t1_ds6cipn	0	*	You can say whatever you want as long as you're joking?
t1_ds6fdjx	1	*	Its primarily right wing. Left wingers on 4chan get btfoed all the time.
t1_ds6e58g	1	*	Maybe but it's also the bedrock of productive discussion. The Rules of Order were published before fascism even existed, and are still in use today.
t1_ds6e1zv	1	*	Too many midichlorians; not fair.
t1_ds6j5mo	0	*	You get back out there and shoot the Comic Sans *right now!*
t1_ds6gqki	1	*	Curation is only fascism to hippies and communists.
t1_ds6dbup	1	*	Apparently hate speech is anything that doesn't bolster the views of the majority. Got it.
t1_ds6hxhm	0	*	No! Not at all, everyone has a right to their own opinions. Reddit is for conversation, it's not meant to be an echo chamber. I was not offended, just making my thoughts known.
t1_ds6fyi9	0	*	I don't think its 'only natural' to go sobbing to nazis cause you were banned from some sub. I didn't go running to fullcommunism when t_d banned me
t1_ds6dw4k	0	*	The only censorship that really happens is not allowing personal attacks and flat out racism. That's not really fascist.
t1_ds6fcrg	0	*	I shitpost to build Karma so that I have Karma to Spare when I disagree with the reddit hivemind.
t1_ds6d3kq	1	*	Yes if a meme is bad, it's essentially the same thing.

t1_ds6ej44	1	*	Hey this is r/wallstreetbets not everyone is autistic here
t1_ds6cefu	1	*	From the description of the picture and the text it does not seem to be a meme.
t1_ds6t38l	1	*	I feel your pain ;-)  I support two lcsw's. After expenses, they aren't really making *anything*... but they enjoy the work I guess.
t1_ds6lb9d	1	*	So, calling everything mainstream media and pretending there's no good journalism out there isn't? *Facepalm.jpg*
t1_ds6d7tb	0	*	In all your examples those who post and are citizens of said nations still need too follow the laws in those nations even on the internet 
t1_ds6owlz	1	*	honestly, probably not. Calling those you disagree with a nazi is the current trend in America.

t1_dsciyq9	0	*	> source?  (video evidence preferred)  You're an idiot. I stopped reading there. Video evidence is exactly why you're as dumb as you are. 
t1_ds6h7ry	1	*	Oof, I get your point now. Apologies for being overly confrontational. 
t1_ds6e6z4	0	*	with free speech you can choose what has value to you, with censorship - you don't 
t1_ds6hqw1	0	*	Very apt username for this topic, take my updoot.

t1_ds6dfem	1	*	In Germany? The German government I would assume. 
t1_ds6cmfk	1	*	Since you're big on proof and definitions: define meme and explain how the content she shared is a meme and why memes should be excluded from applicable law. 
t1_ds6r8hy	1	*	Reminds me of Antifas all black attire. Totally not like SS in any way.
t1_ds8vvbc	0	*	He just never understood that socialism was the precursor to full communism, which marx himself wrote.
t1_ds6fmlo	1	*	Okay.  4 more years  4 more years  4 more years
t1_ds7i04t	0	*	Ah. I guess I didn't know it was marketed to kids. I mean Elsa is awesome. I've never had an issue just skipping a content creator I didn't like.

t1_dsi3lq0	0	*	okay?
t1_dsi3q3k	0	*	yeah it was.   you could get a tape recorder with wired small mic for <$20 at radio shack    EDIT: > to <
t1_dshsao2	0	*	Yes, but what hes saying is that right to work is another example of a phrase thats meant to sound like a good thing but actually screws over workers.
t1_dsi7swe	0	*	Because they're protesting something they created by forcing the company to increase wages.
t1_dshfitm	1	*	If it's like in Norway it's after one year and until you are 60. Then you get another week for the total of 6 weeks pr year
t1_dsr5q4l	0	*	Wait, you think the subway in NYC is free? LMFAO. Delusional Marxist strikes again.
t1_dsi7wp0	1	*	Please get video!

t1_dshvmru	1	*	Can confirm Walmart was a no tip store however if you are gonna pay minimum wage I'm taking that fucking tip. There are thousands of Job's at minimum wage. Your shit isn't special Walmart.

t1_dsi3ofy	0	*	they had taken the work before the strike started.    not to mention the mafia-like behavior of the union, which shouldn't be acceptable in a civilized country.
t1_dsipa3i	1	*	I mean, yeah, my boss bribes me to show up every day.  I wouldn't show up if he didn't.
t1_dshxv64	1	*	Well, I know how I'm spending my weekend.   Load up on singles and grab my skateboard; I'm headin to the Mart.
t1_dshvhqd	0	*	Don't forget the Benny Hill music. 
t1_dshwot4	0	*	Payed? 
t1_dsj5ho9	1	*	Every delivery service in my city has me pegged as a good tipper, and it gets you amazing perks. lol
t1_dsi4m8s	1	*	But they can and do and removing tips is just going to cut the servers pay even if they are paid fair wages.
t1_dshvzr9	0	*	I was a manager for 10 years at a pizza place.  Did your drivers shake the 2 liters of the non tippers too in addition to always delivering them last if there was more than one order ready at a time?
t1_dsr5s4v	0	*	No it's something we are compelled to do. There's a huge difference.

t1_dsdwism	1	*	I make up disorders also!
t1_duqx2h5	1	*	I know. She did this despite knowing her husband was still in Iran. As I said, its likely not as black and white as it appears.
t1_dtvwd7x	0	*	That agreement only came about because this underpaying for your own defense has been going on for *decades*.
t1_dtvx3wy	0	*	Lulz, you expect me to substantiate your outlandish claims??  You dummy!!!  
t1_dtvmlch	0	*	Trump said he would be willing to renegotiate. Instead of doing so, European countries just decided to cry about and point at the big mean USA. The EU is a joke.
t1_dtw51gn	1	*	The US did sign the Paris accord in 2016 under the previous administration. It is in effect until 2020.
t1_dtwpeoy	1	*	Good for you. Thankfully trade agreements are bilateral.
t1_dtvh9he	1	*	Sorry, wrong century. 1894 is the right date. The War was some decades before, and the peace after it was called Pax Americana. Corrected the comment
t1_dtwrrdq	0	*	And the US can say Goodbye to most of their employment as well. Both sides would be hit hard. The question is, which side is more ready to do it.
t1_dtvqi2u	0	*	oh really, it's me who's hating here. Please do tell me about that money we were planning on.
t1_dtvbuzn	0	*	Citation please
t1_dtvo9ej	1	*	At least you are consistent, I agree with you here.
t1_dtvjyag	1	*	The EU should just tell him that if he signs the Paris agreement, the Germans will send him a special crate of his favourite flavour of Faber-Castell crayons.
t1_dtwoo4c	1	*	Because we're talking about absolute amounts of pollution.
t1_dtw3ttm	1	*	Its, non-binding, not a law. Good point tho 
t1_dtvlc6t	0	*	Agree, just as every country has benefited from industrialization and the US doesnt owe other countries some sort of reparations.  
t1_dtvb8qu	1	*	It's better to be quiet instead of talking about the matters you clearly have no idea about. You're just confusing people and spreading lies.
t1_dtvhlt3	1	*	we have a supreme court that ruled on a case called citizens united which basically defines corporations as people who can make virtually unlimited donations to politicians.
t1_dtvp7gw	0	*	What do you mean by Adam? ^^
t1_dtvb23w	0	*	What immigration bill are you imagining they are blocking? Its the GOP who are and have been blocking immigration reform.

t1_dtvv3uf	1	*	Indeed
t1_dtwirof	0	*	Seems to be for the EU, judging by this thread. What has he won exactly with that move now?
t1_dtva24c	0	*	I find it somewhat insulting that they compare the EU to AMC. The EU isn't like some shitty tinbox with wheels. We are the BMW and Mercedes of continental unions!

t1_dsrycga	1	*	I'd rather be capable of fixing a childs mind, than be incapable of fixing their body. It's clear cut to me.
t1_dtrnfjx	0	*	Can't those valuable lessons be taught without pressuring them to believe in imaginary people and places?  There's only one way for a woman to become pregnant.  And animals cannot speak.  Accept it.

t1_dsxfwlu	0	*	Is that why you haven't tried it yet?
t1_dsxf0zf	0	*	> I guess the majority of the mainstream media has fallen for it as well.  MSM often picks up on trending hashtags. Things often get attention  simply because it's trending.
t1_dst44dn	1	*	Wait are you trying to say that you're British? Did you skip all of school?
t1_dsuyrvv	1	*	build then sell. pretty bad idea from the start. 
t1_dsunxuk	1	*	Wouldn't surprise me, government has it's hands in so many pockets right now. If they had to spend 45 billion dollars in taxpayer money to put 1 million in their own pocket, they would. 
t1_dsuvcps	1	*	OK: crashes/disconnections. I still think the water analogy is best.
t1_dtqxzc3	0	*	Hell, the Catholic Church once abducted a small Jewish boy who was baptized against his family's knowledge, because he was Catholic in their eyes
t1_dtqoo8k	1	*	Yes, Iran is much worse and a significantly worse place to live, AND it is getting worse !  Saudis are on the right track. 
t1_dtqtlu1	0	*	Thats what the regime said. I disagree that homosexuals should be brutally murdered. Being called insane by the likes of you is a badge of honor.
t1_dtqpuy4	1	*	Haha yeah they should be like the rest of the world's companies and corporations. At least they have a good humanitarian track record. ^^^^/s
t1_dtqrd4h	0	*	Both are toxically possessive.
t1_dtqtdtf	1	*	They are both authoritarian theocracy that exist as obstacles against the progress of human civilization.  In this regard there is no difference between the two.
t1_dtrcbfe	1	*	I'm pretty sure they're supporting Hamas again after their rift over support for Assad ended. During the period when they weren't they found some other off brand Palestinian terrorist group to support

t1_dt2yy4c	0	*	You really think the average person lives better than a 16th century king? What do you base that on? Sperg? How old are you? 
t1_dt2ltpd	0	*	 Depends on what you mean by standard of living. To some people, freedom is paramount and no amount of tv screens and fast food will make them happy.
t1_dud0cec	0	*	Then why use the system that uses greed as it driving force? 
t1_dud0dyw	0	*	Oh sure, corruption is not unique to capitalism. However, the entire system is driven by greed, capital accumulation and profit maximization. If human greed is a problem - why enable it?
t1_dud34gm	0	*	Some socialist features like abolition of private property and worker-controlled workplaces, I agree.
t1_dunb2dg	0	*	You called it a utopia not me. Im just saying there arent frequent mass shootings in other countries. Nobody is talking abt knife crimes here.

t1_dsbxj1k	0	*	Russia is an economic joke.  For instance, it's GDP is only about $1.5 trillion, which is in the neighborhood of Italy, Canada,  and Korea. China isn't going to stick its neck out for Russia.

t1_dsbve03	0	*	It simply means that everything else has failed and you are willing to partially destroy your own country in a war of attrition for the purpose of winning a war. It's not something you do lightly.
t1_dsc0eyu	1	*	Seems that way. I'm just saying that's something I could foresee as possible, unlike a hot war with Russia proper.

t1_dsbvg8c	0	*	Bro in no way is that sustainable or feasible lol
t1_dsc3wot	1	*	Nobody pushed NATO east except for Russia itself. Poland, etc didn't ally with the west because of sneaky American diplomacy. They did it because life under Russia's influence was absolute shit
t1_dsc10vr	1	*	Yeah honestly Hang the DJ was the best one, and I thought the last, Black Museum, was kinda weak. It was just a lame White Christmas all over again.

t1_dv0dvsy	1	*	Needs more data. Or do you just 'trust in the lord' over in that third world oligarchy shithole?
t1_duzyzr5	0	*	The definition of racism hasnt changed, people misuse language all the time. 
t1_dv10nm2	0	*	a drastic misinterpretation of nuance.
t1_duzu51h	0	*	Okay. 
t1_duzxaux	0	*	 This was happening in the early 90s (and before). When did Batista lose power?
t1_dv02z59	0	*	That would make you a misogynist. Not necessarily a sexist.
t1_dv17aiz	1	*	You can't call it terrorism if the government supported it. You gotta call it patriotism.  Terrorism = something government does not support.  Patriotism = something government does support.
t1_dv06yx9	1	*	Increased taxes, esp. estate.
t1_duzwv3c	0	*	any crime in general?
t1_dv04p5e	1	*	Sounds like more of a generalisation than racism.
t1_dv181kx	1	*	What? I,m not judging atrump. I was telling you what he said and how his supporters are reacting
t1_dv01myl	1	*	Racism is fueling this
t1_dv2g2ov	1	*	Nah what you're after is a tiny hobo dinosaur - you know, a compsognathus tramp
t1_dv0s67a	1	*	But collectivizing the entire economy is socialism. Centralizing this kind of power to seize means of production is part and parcel socialism.  And socialism doesn't work. 
t1_dv0091m	1	*	Right on cue.
t1_duzsu4i	0	*	Do you have a quote from the commenter to support that conclusion?  As a white man, I have no idea where you got that impression.

t1_dv06q4y	1	*	yeah man, white refugees fleeing genocide to the white continentis totally shitty fam. stay woke.
t1_dv0mzwl	1	*	Didn't say they didn't, just that they can enjoy their country being a shit hole now.
t1_dv00g8y	0	*	I agree, but this isn't a simple matter of a little redistribution. This is take ALL the land away from white farmers and we're not here to kill white people YET (his words.)
t1_dv06xbq	0	*	> 90+%  > monopoly  Ah, I see you have no idea what words mean.
t1_dv0emmc	0	*	Still nonsense. You can take money out of SA rather easily both legally and illegally

t1_dv1bpy8	1	*	That's good then. Hopefully the system will work as intended and prevent some atrocities. 
t1_dv0317h	0	*	They were miles behind.  Maybe in 500 years they'd be caught up lol  That's being pretty charitable. Thousands of years is more likely.
t1_duzyual	0	*	I feel you must be on Tumblr a lot, and are just projecting. Or can't think of anything to say so just use Tumblr as an insult?  Either way it's quiet strange. 
t1_dv01qf5	0	*	6% of a country =/= a country.
t1_dv00c49	0	*	Hawaii was built by black slaves?

t1_duztezc	0	*	His daughter is not him
t1_dv1ciqj	1	*	And I'm sure most of Africa will catch up very quickly during this century, but that doesn't mean that blaming colonialism for all of Africa's woes is simplistic and dumb.
t1_dv0m607	0	*	Oh yea the comparison is totally the same /s. How fucking dense are you. 
t1_dv0coaq	1	*	Yes, because if there were any other one, they would've done it a long time ago.  If you believe you're not being fed a bunch of propaganda about what really went down there, you're naive.
t1_dv0eseg	0	*	and also not true
t1_dv06cz2	1	*	And their religion isnt compatible with western culture and is one of the main source of the racial tension in western countries, is that so hard for you to understand?

t1_dv0emql	1	*	I'm sure either the almighty petrodollar will supply them with arms. That or Russia; here's hoping.
t1_dv013f1	0	*	Do you have evidence its a genocide? 
t1_dv0ctqd	1	*	Amazing what happens when a minority group represses the majority 
t1_duzzvsv	0	*	Man, if Cuba is so great, why do thousands of its citizens risk their lives every year by floating on makeshift rafts to Florida to escape?
t1_dv00pxh	1	*	No, don't.

t1_dv00mf6	0	*	If you steal it back yes.
t1_duzyzbf	1	*	Cried wold like said that the immigration reform passed in the 1960s in Canada and the USA would eventually lead to whites becoming a minority in these countries?
t1_dv00yhf	0	*	It is neither going to the person it was taken from, nor coming from the person who took it. It is solely being taken from someone based on their race. That's so not woke.
t1_dv01hz7	1	*	White is a color.
t1_dv014xj	1	*	Go to south africa for 2 weeks then get back to us. 
t1_dv0eb68	1	*	It was also famously said by Tata Madiba, Nelson Mandela.
t1_dv05qn8	0	*	Thanks. Dark times, dark words.  I wish humans were better than this. We could be but we're just not.
t1_dv160an	1	*	Do we though? Look up how many active military bases we have all over the world. We are in perpetual wars that werent even constitutionally declared 
t1_duzxgqk	0	*	What are they reading in Cuba again? Ah yes. State run media newspapers.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_Cuba  Many Health orgs are backed by the US even when USSR backed them. 
t1_dv0idg8	1	*	No one is
t1_dv0vx1l	1	*	Yeah and Affirmative Action still exists. Quotas still exist for good colleges. If you're not taking  advantage of that shit, it's your own fault. 
t1_dv01p42	1	*	The US might be in it for the long game : profit. Kaffir Boy was an excellent read on the US ties to Apartheid. 
t1_dv02p5e	1	*	Okay. 
t1_dv097c8	1	*	Right but the canadian judgment is from before this happened. I would agree they are persecuted now, officially. 
t1_dv05cft	0	*	It was less lying than it was leaving out the bloody, shitty bits for a few years
t1_dv086yp	1	*	Huh?
t1_duzze1j	1	*	Whites hold like 90% of the power and you don't feel like a minority when you are in an entire country full of people of the same race. Still, I don't see what you're getting at anyway
t1_duzzptd	0	*	Can you link that? I've never seen/read of him doing this.
t1_duzzws0	0	*	He was pretty heavily implying they were shitholes because of the race of the people who live there, not their politics or economic policies.
t1_dv14d5g	0	*	Race is a social construct.  It's silly to pretend white doesn't hold a pre prescribed meaning.  Whose leg are you trying to pull, mine or yours?
t1_dv0eoso	1	*	Also [this](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodesian_Bush_War).  10:1 casualty ratio; they'll need it.
t1_dv0rssh	1	*	Source? 
t1_dv01n6d	0	*	That's because reverse racism isn't a real thing!! It's literally a poor excuse to justify more racism. Reverse racism = Racism

t1_dv6bk3j	1	*	Correct
t1_dv019bj	0	*	Do you mean permanent citizens?    Obviously if they don't have a place to exist safely of course.   Wait is equality of race bad?
t1_dv03h3o	1	*	Because they're irrelevant and low key supporting a fairly xenophobic argument that's (not by you) built on an entirely bullshit statement. 
t1_dv43zdn	1	*	You really are ignorant to what a devastation lack of education is.   So you expect uneducated people to make educated rational decisions.... do you not see how naive you sound right now?
t1_duzyhaz	0	*	Not right but that isn't the policy. Stop conflating expropriation with murder. 
t1_dv041iz	1	*	I think he meant it more in a social grace and manners context than a legal one.
t1_dv04dfi	0	*	Governments need harsh lessons and that's as harsh as it gets
t1_dv03d9h	0	*	I have no idea what you are talking about.

t1_dv0hozz	0	*	I am not very informed about the beliefs of the people who run south Africa, can you give me some links and context to understand this?
t1_dv01m5b	0	*	Corrupt politicians who have accomplished very little over the past 24 years still blaming white people is what is feuling this. 
t1_dv03jq8	0	*	If that's really the only time you interact with Germans in Germany, then you really need to branch out and not wall off native members of your host country.
t1_duzwn5p	0	*	Sure, but ultimately it's so they can stay in power and collect money from said industries
t1_dv01dy1	1	*	Its a law written by a Marxist politician informed by and intended to act out his Marxist political ideas in the political arena. Youre really going to argue that it isnt somehow Marxism? 
t1_dv02lf3	1	*	It will be nice for those 5 minutes though.
t1_dv5tj7z	1	*	Lol apartheid ended in 1991 kid. Obviously you're too young to remember it. You can just look at the US and see how long the effects of slavery have lasted. 
t1_dv2de2s	1	*	And Afrikaans do have a lot of guns. 
t1_duzyo64	0	*	It's pretty hot
t1_duztn7l	1	*	Yes, and the Democrats and Republicans haven't changed at all in 150 years..../s

t1_dv26p6g	0	*	You sound like a pretty smart person. Dont waste your intellect on petty shit like this. 
t1_duzzxf4	0	*	That source states half of America has laws protecting gay rights. And obviously this will increase as time goes on. And seriously you can't let Trump speak for all conservatives. He's an idiot.
t1_dv0bvof	1	*	The Spanish aren't white now?
t1_duzxwvf	1	*	That sounds like the start of a sitcom...
t1_dv00n45	0	*	You think I'm unaware of that?
t1_dv01t2y	0	*	Race =/= country of origin
t1_dv10kdl	1	*	I don't live in the states but it seems similar here in Canada. Lots of focus on the treatment of indigenous people and residential schools.
t1_dv00v5d	0	*	Those slaves descendants are a minority of South African blacks. While the adult slave population outnumbered the adult colonial population, the native population dwarfs them both. 
t1_dv04upa	0	*	Nope just my personal interactions trying to explain to some people that white people can also be victims of racism. I dont think theyve done tests on the subject.
t1_dv09i6g	1	*	Push us down long enough and people like you will be the ones in the ground. Not us. 
t1_dv02gio	1	*	Provide an opposing statement. What the poster above this comment said made sense, is it wrong?
t1_dv0a5ya	0	*	It's almost 1am and I have work tomorrow. Do you?
t1_dv035op	1	*	Who here is supporting any racism towards anyone? They're all assholes we just have different perspectives. 
t1_dv02ai6	0	*	He's dismissing my point about the second amendment being necessary to prevent this kind of government abuse of it's citizens. Only a lib would do that.

t1_dt78wsi	0	*	Why not run it like a protectorate until it's economically stable? 
t1_dt7fml7	0	*	We can also create new sounds. Gorrillas can't do that 
t1_dt7osil	1	*	Fun fact, game of thrones is based heavily on the war of the roses a war between two English families, the Lancaster's and the York's. Yes, g.r.r. Martin is a hack.
t1_dt7hv2f	0	*	Hey, we paid for it fair and square, at that point it's not a colony, it's a holiday home. And a timeshare at that.

t1_dt7uifb	1	*	This is why I love kiwis.  A friend of mine once said New Zealanders consider soccer that you pick up your 12 year old daughter from.
t1_dt7e42q	1	*	Young people adapt pretty quickly to new opportunities. Old people suck at adapting no matter where they lived when they were young. I really don't see the problem.
t1_dt7e5bj	1	*	Any community that gets its laughs by pretending to be idiots will eventually be flooded by actual idiots who mistakenly believe that they're in good company.
t1_dt7ifpt	1	*	I think its the pirate the bay. That torrent site. 
t1_dt7dkn7	0	*	I'm aware. But 2017 HK is very different than the colonial HK of 20 yesrs ago.  Things change - agreements can be amended. I suspect it will be.

t1_dt77npc	0	*	Ya mean like East germany
t1_dt79sd5	1	*	Many North Koreans cross into China border towns to make calls to their relatives in South Korea. That's how many defectors keep in touch with their family.

t1_dt7s6vc	1	*	Wait are we still taking about the game, Civilization?
t1_dt7m0aa	1	*	So little is recorded, I feel it would amount in most schools to flashcards about each native culture by geography. 
t1_dt7drxp	0	*	Technically strains the relationship but what is NK doing to say or do? Threaten China with what?

t1_dt7ewjl	1	*	They Hate Us Cuz They Anus
t1_dt7ngqx	1	*	Lol
t1_dt81qce	1	*	I love how I can casually go on to Reddit for a few minutes and learn more about [Flat Earth] history than Ive learned in my entire life! 
t1_dt786b7	1	*	By a beloved friend no less...
t1_dt7jj1n	1	*	Come on over friend. 
t1_dt7cgvt	0	*	I think you should read my comment again lol
t1_dt7e8xw	1	*	Thats fair, I dont claim to know him or anything, Im just making sure all possible perspectives are observed when analyzing him and his antics 
t1_dt7nilu	1	*	Yet to be fair the north was richer, more egalitarian (on the paper at least) and probably felt more free and less oppressive at the time.
t1_dt7bpkh	0	*	This is a false dichotomy
t1_dt7av25	0	*	Directed by Dennis Rodman.
t1_dt8pipj	1	*	After Middle Chinese, the Chinese language split into the multiple Chinese languages now present in China, such as Mandarin, Cantonese, Hokkien, etc. 
t1_dt7ul88	1	*	Because he is american.
t1_dt7g5de	1	*	I, too, remember life before the internet.
t1_dt7g9x2	0	*	His spouse is a Hillary supporter, he married himself i guess he never loses an argument with his other half.
t1_dt7he2u	0	*	Canada is the middle child that moved away from the rest of the family and only calls to check in. 
t1_dt74o52	1	*	You mean rob them? Or use them as slave labour in an apartheid situation?  Take a moment to think before you make suggestions.
t1_dt7cqyb	1	*	Awesome! Never seen this before. 
t1_dt7quai	0	*	Yeah, and this is why independent unions are illegal. Because they care about workers. They westernised technologically, so they should westernise politically too
t1_dt7mdgr	1	*	I never thought I'd ever see a real life Lawful Stupid
t1_dt7hx2p	1	*	In Canada, there is a lot of teaching about the First Nations and when the Europeans came to Canada. You learn a lot about the fur trade and how they lived, hunted etc.
t1_dt8rvpt	1	*	The records aren't very prolific for most of them, though.  In places where, for example, the Iroquois were prevalent, there is a lot more native history taught.
t1_dt7b46y	0	*	> North Korea entered the shit zone when Kim Il Sung passed away  Then later you said that without a proper plan of any sorts, Kim Il Sung purged all opposition. Did you mean Kim Jong-Il?  
t1_dt7a19g	0	*	I know nothing of this history. Im just here to tell you I love your username. 
t1_dt7gnxa	1	*	Wasn't refuting you I was asking an honest question... take the anxiety down a few notches - not everyone is out to get you.  Thanks for the response it sounded like you might know some things.
t1_dt7pwe3	1	*	OMG ive never played this, but it's right up my alley! I'm gonna teach it to my nephews!
t1_dt7i540	1	*	In all fairness, South Korea was kinda pulling a [small genocide against communists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bodo_League_massacre) at the time, so NK may have seemed pretty chill
t1_dt7hhe3	0	*	No you had the Celts before that :0
t1_dt7jbim	0	*	Glad to be told so, maybe your education is as different as ours.
t1_dt7f3vl	0	*	of course, people routinely fight over millionaire athletes playing games on tv. people are really dumb
t1_dt7go9g	1	*	> caring what sounds other people make with their mouths when no one is around  The word Hmmm is offensive to me so never say it again OK thanks
t1_dt7c3u1	0	*	I mean, that's what they said about slavery in the U.S. ...
t1_dt7d206	1	*	Not just presume, we definitely get some good shots of people who clearly have no weapons get gunned down
t1_dt79p32	1	*	dude that fucking sucks for them holy shit 
t1_dt7jxfw	1	*	'the common redditor ... Far more right wing than...2006'  Jesus fucking Christ this place must have literally been the Socialist Worker's Party then.
t1_dt7c715	1	*	True. I doubt reunification will ever happen, until the North Korean people themselves rise up and destroy the dictatorship from the inside. 
t1_dt7fnyr	1	*	10/10 wouldhangoutwiththem
t1_dus59nj	0	*	The Kurds are an ethnic group, that's why I said this. 
t1_dutw1hu	0	*	You would then be a political refugee, which is a group.

t1_dusq4hc	0	*	Please give us incite into your wisdom master. 
t1_dus4y3c	0	*	The negative -ish at the end of verbs is Egyptian. 
t1_dus5j9a	0	*	I'm not saying it's not. Your anecdote just doesn't seem reasonable either. According to country-specific data from New America, it seems roughly 10% of those killed by US drones are civilians. 
t1_dusekje	1	*	Yes. :/
t1_dusn6j0	1	*	/r/totallynotrobots 
t1_durzaca	0	*	I think you're spot on with that interpretation. Did you learn *classical* Arabic too?  I thought that's what most non-natives would have studied first or mainly.
t1_durzl1w	0	*	Not so convincing. Posting the same Shit over and over, lumping everyone anti Assad as ISIS. Russian misinformation
t1_dus0b2v	1	*	its scary even to say mukhabarat tbh
t1_durzntb	1	*	I'll never forget the first time I saw that. 
t1_dusakjo	1	*	The truth is inconvenient I suppose. It seems as though the realization of just how immensely powerful and expansive our military industrial complex is unnerving to some.
t1_dusg9hu	0	*	I gotta ask, so what exactly do you do? Are you an interpreter/translator, or some sort of advisor on foreign affairs? It seems interesting.
t1_duscfv8	0	*	Thanks for that!
t1_dusa0vq	1	*	Ah, you're right, my apologies. The Wikipedia article made the tungsten comparison based on density, not radioactivity. Good catch.
t1_dus47c3	1	*	> The Kurds aren't just one homogenous group.  exactly my point. I wasn't limiting to PKK
t1_dus789e	1	*	Right. Sorry I got mixed up a bit. Saw someone referring back to Flanders Field and thought this was a continuation of that thought. My mistake. 
t1_durzzm7	0	*	While other rebel groups wanted Assad's head on a spike. Pretty significant difference. 
t1_dus3r1f	1	*	Just wanted to say thank you for this. wish more western first world people could see this perspective regarding authoritarian regimes in not so fortunate countries as their own 
t1_dusel9i	0	*	The shelter also has bombs and bullets flying around it like the sword of damocles though. And even if you survive, there's no guarantee you'll survive intact.
t1_dus09q0	0	*	Unfortunately I'm not a US citizen. Had I been I'd probably had joined the Marines or the Army with hopes of doing intelligence work
t1_dus1pr9	0	*	Then go protest it. Dont support another piece of shit dictator who hates his own people.
t1_dusyxls	1	*	... sundown towns?  I'm from a town of 4,000 that is 2 hours from no where, and I've never heard of that - at all.    Dipshit.
t1_durwk72	1	*	...what did I just read?
t1_durzjs6	0	*	ehhhh, we gave the rebels a lot of TOW's which really gave the government problems for a long time. 
t1_duxekef	0	*	> Lol okay, still havent stated a news source that you trust..  Do I need to in order to point out that you saying you trust the BBC says a lot?
t1_dusj4sv	0	*	So is it akin to those who stay through the hurricane?
t1_dus9dv9	1	*	Anything can be radioactive if you shoot enough ions into it right 
t1_dutfspp	1	*	Everyone should stop using it >.<
t1_dushilb	1	*	Wrong thread mate. 
t1_dutvvoz	1	*	Every country uses the UN definition, which is what I quoted.  Its the legal definition.
t1_durzir0	0	*	Haha I can only guess what side youre on :P
t1_durweo3	0	*	Now kiss
t1_dus0q2u	1	*	Everyone would like to live 50 years after a revolution, but nobody in their right mind would actually want to live during one.
t1_duryyjs	1	*	This is a new-world order conspiracy site.  I bet if I looked long enough at this diatribe Id eventually find something about Jews secretly running the world.
t1_dsv66is	1	*	In order to control people
t1_dt4r4yy	0	*	Adjust for spending power and the fact that families are not 2 income families, not one. Wow, magic.
t1_dt4x0f4	1	*	You're right topazsparrow. and you're also smart and handsome.
t1_dt5tama	0	*	I'd genuinely prefer an uninvolved, neutral third party to analyse the texts and tell me the same thing. A party with an open regarding its funding.
t1_dt4m0ae	0	*	Mental Health is a serious issue and i hope you get the help you need man.
t1_dt4yd9b	0	*	Wtf are you even saying?
t1_dt4hc68	0	*	lol k. Completely skipping my point to believe what you want.  USA! USA! USA! USA!
t1_dt4ujlu	1	*	> Well for that you listen to PR departments and marketing departments    Because they're obviously telling the truth.
t1_dt57879	1	*	I've learned a lot on here and been corrected many times. Thanks for acknowledging.
t1_dt4fwpa	1	*	Now I'm waiting for replies explaining to you that asking for explanations makes *you* the problem.
t1_dt618sb	1	*	Correct. Complacency is why you're in this mess.
t1_dt4sbjs	1	*	Pardon?
t1_dt50t5w	1	*	If you don't know much about it,  how can you form any opinion about it?
t1_dt5eetu	1	*	Again, what I am saying is that it was a poor strategy to leave TPP without something to replace that with; something the US could also be in on. Leaving the table altogether is not how you negotiate.
t1_dt4ngt9	0	*	We (in the us) get to but cheaper stuff, so I can spend the money I would have spent on those goods on other things, like steam sales.
t1_ds5n8l7	0	*	Yeah, it sounds ridiculous.. and if the thing is a fact, it becomes horrendous at a pristine level. There is a reason that pakistan has not been able to grow a spine in 70 yrs of its existence.
t1_dsydi0z	0	*	No battery saver, and no AV. Even installed Greenify to try it, but didn't help performance--only helped battery a little bit.
t1_dsy78tq	0	*	If your device didnt work directly after you replacing a component, either the component was faulty, or you killed it. 
t1_dsz2y4l	1	*	30 bucks plus battery price  No thanks, my Samsung s3 is fine

t1_dt6s9r6	0	*	> there's no reason to insist that it must be a serious and literal account of unwanted forceful physically interaction.  Except for all the women accusing him of doing exactly that, of course.
t1_dt6kuiw	1	*	So how many kids so far have gone around grabbing people by the pussy?
t1_du5ya48	0	*	and then that would make the doctor a &#x63;&#x75;&#x6E;&#x74;.
t1_du64xln	0	*	It's not that people think there was an attack. It's just that you saying Jetlag is the cause is fucking stupid.
t1_du6fay1	0	*	na you don't have the balls to do it, turns out trying to overcompensate a micro dick with guns does not work.
t1_dsd6775	0	*	i don't have the links to the actual patients my link died. just the news story about the weapons which exist so there must be a patient or two in the mix.
t1_dsc8omn	0	*	So you're trying to clear that up by suggesting three other possibilities also with absolutely no evidence? Way to clear up confusion champ.
t1_dscvab8	0	*	How do we know you're not in the CIA and trying to manipulate us?
t1_dszr23c	0	*	Sorry bud, but this is just a bunch of incoherent bullshit. 
t1_du3yp8k	1	*	And it's name such because you're reducing the oxidation number. Whoever decided to put this as the convention sucks.

t1_du3mjs8	1	*	Yeah this is what I think the previous poster was getting at, but thanks for clarifying :)
t1_dujcins	1	*	Will you force people to hunt? Because only small % of people are willing to freeze their butts and spend their mony to hunt wild pigs which taste like shit. 
t1_dukj8eg	0	*	Ever seen a pack of wolves bring down a massive moose?  They clip their achilles tendons and take down their legs.  Coyotes do the same with deer.
t1_ds8pfw5	0	*	Show me where the Democrats officially support child molesters like deplorable Republicans.
t1_du35b8q	0	*	There's many different reasons. I'd definitely put the state democrats to blame for putting up weak ass candidates for one. Gerrymandering is a big issue here too. 
t1_du8o27j	0	*	Ha! Agreed. I am certainly greedy but like you said, I don't seem to be overpowered by it (yet).

t1_ds39q47	0	*	Oh fuck, all those deaths were caused by electronics larger than a cellphone? But lifted the ban in less than 4 months?
t1_ds2qlb9	0	*	Rumour has it that the heavily pregnant mother of Michael Phelps would take non-stop transpacific flights until her son was born.
t1_ds33j5q	0	*	Can I formally request we don't make this subreddit until after the current administration is out, just so they don't see it as a challenge?
t1_ds36z3l	0	*	Same here. I exchanged some comments in a debate with a random redditor who is/was a mod there. He deemed my words to be sufficiently anti-Trump to have me preemptively banned from their echo chamber.
t1_ds36lsr	0	*	I don't even know if I'm banned. I've never tried to comment. I do go there sometimes when a major news story breaks to see how they react. It's. . . distressing.

t1_ds2spyf	0	*	So you're saying that if people don't share your political views they aren't as good? The righteousness and condemnation from you is astonishing

t1_duxmaf2	0	*	I don't think you're quite grasping the subject here. That's ok. 
t1_duy0gdz	1	*	Thats what I was told at a museum in Istanbul by a curator, but they might have been mistaken.
t1_duxyuej	0	*	Except they don't have the right to choose there?
t1_duxl4rc	0	*	Well if she has a single cousin or sister :)
t1_duxs5zd	0	*	I don't think you are entirely wrong.   http://countrystudies.us/algeria/61.htm  However, you are wrong.
t1_duyy4qj	1	*	Oh yeah they look similar, thank you !
t1_duxq8bt	1	*	Now THIS is hilarious. I honestly enjoyed the entire backstory you made for me. Thanks!
t1_duxk6ki	0	*	Stop trying to compare them,  jesus. Mormonism is on a different level of stupid than other religions...  Except Scientology. 
t1_duyks3e	0	*	Prevents shin and calf sunburns. Sunburns are said to promote skin cancer, carcinoma I think, among others.
t1_duxyvkw	1	*	White cheddar wear cheese on our heads?

t1_duxvd07	1	*	If you reached that point you're probably going to get tortured and imprisoned anyway.
t1_duy6m8w	1	*	I never said my world was easy. Those bitches can get savage.
t1_duydcam	1	*	Which part?
t1_duy5f1t	1	*	lol, I have a narrow view of history? There were ancient Greek philosophers who espoused atheism. 
t1_duxkwpd	1	*	>Or do you really believe any woman would want to wear that ridiculous piece of shit?         It's a headscarf... are you confusing it with a burkqa?
t1_duxmerj	1	*	It's indoctrination all the way down.
t1_duyd8n3	0	*	No but I do expect thst it not blatantly insult a whopping half of its constituents. I personally assumed I made that part clear. 
t1_duxkn0v	0	*	when talking about free will it is to many...
t1_duxmlmm	1	*	Never mind. It wasnt you. Good day sir! 
t1_duxor3g	1	*	Yippikaiye motherfucker
t1_duxrwdo	1	*	Interesting. Thanks for the response! I wonder how many universities actually run these exit relays. 
t1_duxj7u9	1	*	I meant in the context of the above comment. Just seems like you're attacking the user for the sake of attacking them.
t1_duxqnw4	1	*	Do you know what logic is? 
t1_duxln79	0	*	Why would I? This quote is sexist regardless of the context lol. If you have something to add, do so. Don't be condescending because others couldn't be bothered to research your unique interests lmao.
t1_duxxp72	0	*	And just like that my statement was torn 
t1_duyy53g	1	*	Thank you for your answer :)
t1_duxjntd	0	*	Obvious troll is obvious
t1_duygsqo	1	*	So I called my uncle Putin and had him reeducated...a little off key but it works in context.
t1_duxwddg	0	*	Self-defense is not genocide.
t1_dtdfmma	0	*	Not if you look at the number of criminals trying to crack them.   I mean, as for crimes, cracking a crypto exchange is probably among the most profitable and least risky things to do. 
t1_dtd715v	0	*	I believe there's something called rule of law which prevents that.
t1_dtdltwm	0	*	Well then how would this be any different with Bitcoin?
t1_dt5ed3j	1	*	Evolution is far from perfect. It just does what's enough not to die.
t1_dt5tdrh	0	*	Must be a legal state. I pay 20 a g for top grade chronic. 
t1_dt5sy11	0	*	Fair and independent sociological measurement institutions. . .. ... Oh, right Cosmos
t1_dt6hmx1	0	*	Comparable? How does cannabis or caffeine compare to LSDs effects?  Doesn't negate the **fact** that there are still effects.
t1_dt60ven	0	*	Seems like smoking and driving would be as distracting as texting and driving, the primary difference being that the phone is not on fire.
t1_dt0xg9t	1	*	What? Did I do?
t1_dudy731	0	*	Do you know what an alliance is?
t1_dsr4nc9	1	*	Gesundheit

t1_dsi147n	0	*	Wow, just wow. While Russia isn't a paradise (Well, neither is the US) they aren't going to shoot down a passenger jet deliberately.
t1_dsim7ll	1	*	No, but hacking = influencing. They just also did other things outside the hack, but the hack is still part of it.
t1_dsi31nx	0	*	There ya go again!  Why are you getting mad at me for stealing? EVERYONE does it! 
t1_dsielm3	1	*	Off duty troops used that anti aircraft vehicle for transportation to their vacation resort and Ivan accidentally pressed the wrong button while messing with the radio.
t1_dsin4qi	0	*	No, his sentiment is that nations operate in ways that cannot be worked against with civilian methods  
t1_dsrs1e1	0	*	So, what should we do? Let them spend their stolen money freely without interference from our authorities?  Seriously, what do you think we should do?
t1_dsi891q	0	*	Thats not concerning to you? 
t1_dtkwxfu	0	*	Which now perfectly aligns by party. 
t1_dtm6hme	1	*	I voted for someone who would break the complacent system. And he is.
t1_dtkvopa	0	*	There are next to no new individuals falling into the 1% bracket. Its old money. 
t1_dtlfeiu	1	*	And there was still no billion spent in that article. The closet was the $900 million the Kochs were going to spend. 
t1_dtku0dy	0	*	That's not the Clinton Foundation, hold this L and this block. Dumb Republican knuckledragger 
t1_dtkusbi	1	*	Just you wait 10 years, the Republican party will make you want to give an arm and a leg to go back.
t1_dtl06d1	1	*	 Automation will happen regardless. It's a matter of how well we can manage the transition period.
t1_dtl1j4o	0	*	A quick Google: https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/recips.php?ind=K02++  9R, 11D make up the top 20
t1_dtet3hz	0	*	The most interesting part of that document is 2013. Let's dig up and compare polls in USSR done in 1990 and 1991, you will be surprized how one year can change things
t1_dt2vigj	0	*	Except for death
t1_dt46w4z	0	*	Yeah, so whatever the original poster is trying to say doesnt have a valid case. 
t1_dtru94z	1	*	It's OK if she is. As long as you guys are happy with your lives and each other, something like that isn't a big deal.  
t1_dtrvt3f	0	*	What's not to understand with what he said?
t1_dtrx80x	1	*	Rest in peace, Oscar!
t1_dtrv8gx	1	*	...so how about them eagles?
t1_dts0otf	0	*	Those arent bribes. The various officials dont get to keep that cash over and above their salary. If you think the fees are unreasonable thats an entirely separate thing.
t1_dtrv5bk	0	*	I am just a little more than almost positive they already knew that too lol
t1_dts7vpo	0	*	Name one. Let's get super detailed. I'm all about it. Ready? Go!
t1_dtsb7p7	0	*	That was a really risky and NSFW click
t1_dtscqb5	1	*	No, big shoes. 
t1_dtrx2t9	0	*	They might even give you a fake document at the end of the process. Anything to do with land can get really dodgy real quick.
t1_dts5giu	0	*	So it's similar to street level drug dealers and the cartels then.   Do we jail them all or let them feed their families? (The poachers and the dealers.)
t1_dtrz06q	1	*	> repels everybody away like opposite poles on a magnet  [Ackchyally](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/191/035/135.png)....  Opposite ends attract.
t1_dts20mt	0	*	lmfao its kenya just go shoot them and their family if they scam you
t1_dts8lid	1	*	Then sorry. She isnt cool. Its part of the law. To be cool you gotta kill poachers. Ive killed 3 myself. 
t1_dtscjxf	0	*	Can you count how many lions have eaten Rhino or Elephant? 
t1_dtrzqd9	1	*	That's bribery at the corporate/lobbyist level.  You don't need to bribe someone to do their job.
t1_dtsfm5v	1	*	>teeming  ftfy
t1_dts23ex	1	*	It's not even close to the same. You don't have to bribe your bus driver or your plumbing inspector. You don't carry $50 every time you drive in case you need to bribe the police. 
t1_dts4ufz	1	*	What years and what MOS? Active or reserve/NG?
t1_dts97ed	0	*	It wasn't food supplies. In North America, 73% of large mammals, including the mammoth, we're hunted to extinction by humans. The evidence on this is pretty conclusive.
t1_dtrv40z	1	*	Um.
t1_dtti1vk	0	*	Is there an influx of crazy westerners who try to bribe a lot of people and live like miniature crimelords?
t1_dtrxnom	1	*	>Wrongdoing and abuses of power have to be more subtle  that's what they said. lobbying seems more subtle to me than give us $50 and we won't investigate a murder
t1_dtrx2ll	0	*	How absolutely naive. 
t1_dtrxez9	0	*	Yeah it's hard to compare saving shelter dogs and cats to somebody hunting those that are killing endangered species in Africa. 
t1_dtsczfk	1	*	Because there's no anal involved at all.
t1_dtrwt6s	1	*	Feets don't fail me now!
t1_dtrv9hu	1	*	Calm down its just the internet b
t1_dts1zlq	1	*	It's not a story Reddit would tell you.
t1_dtrwvtf	1	*	Yeah but lobbying is a more subtle bribery than people being required to bribe anyone for any work done. 
t1_dtrvcs4	1	*	Chill dude. You're right but don't give yourself an aneurysm when somebody irritates you. The only one who suffers from that is yourself.
t1_dtt8tvn	1	*	I think I read an Animorphs book about this.
t1_dtsk5zq	0	*	But that's a whole pride. Aren't we going with one lion?
t1_dts3k6e	0	*	Oh absolutely. Ive had anger issues since Im a child and its gotten a lot better recently. I went from throwing shit around and punching walls to cursing on reddit.
t1_dtryjq8	0	*	I don't remember this quest - was it in Wine and Blood?
t1_duxn1aj	0	*	That's fair enough. I can understand that. I get how your viewpoint makes sense and I actually agree   ~~Now please unshadowban me~~  Never mind all they did was censor me.
t1_duy3nmf	0	*	how so?
t1_duxdm6l	1	*	none of what I said was personal
t1_duxxzt5	0	*	Nobody's crusading bro, it's just what it is. The culture's changing and the world's becoming a very different place.
t1_duxn6ko	1	*	No one's lying bro. Go to r/China and tell them reddit is blocked. They'll tell you it's not like everyone else here.
t1_duxssku	0	*	Yeah and look how well the Philipinnes is doing...
t1_duxhm2h	0	*	Speak of the devil..
t1_duymwzm	0	*	Wrong.  Everybody knows Google censors extensive amounts of information.  The only question is what and why.
t1_duxgkil	1	*	He's saying that reddit is not popular enough in China for them to block it. 
t1_dv0rt18	0	*	You know who these people would choose to promote? People who think like them. 
t1_dv0d6eg	0	*	Okay, does that mean that just aslong as you are allowed to vote it's a democracy? Even if you have no power? The act of just voting is what defines it? 
t1_e13adjk	0	*	I know 
t1_dv0nsj5	0	*	If youre running things correctly youre going to be hitting similar rates whether you work 6 or 8 hours in a day. 6 would result in less production. Very complex I know. 
t1_dvfpdy1	1	*	>  It has everything to do with practicality and value of your time.  Says the man spending his time in pointless arguments with strangers on reddit.
t1_dv0k45o	1	*	because of the use (historical and present) of indirect elections
t1_dv0ifeb	0	*	Because they are brainwashed to hate them.
t1_dv0mqbp	1	*	Not all heroes wear capes.   Keep fighting the good fight. 
t1_dv1ld0r	1	*	That sucks. You'd think they have enough artificial barriers to entry in place... 
t1_dv0f2ud	0	*	How does that refute what I said? There is a difference but a country can be both a democracy and a republic at the same time.
t1_dv0io3q	0	*	They would still hate them if their health insurance was swapped for cheaper tax for universal healthcare.
t1_dv0lr2p	0	*	You work 6 hours a day with a break? Lmao. That's incredible. 
t1_dv0mrnr	0	*	My director is gen x and is the reason I'm not 90% work from home.   The boomers passed the idea along. 
t1_dv0i4ec	0	*	Wrong. 
t1_dv0kg2b	0	*	We started a war over taxes.
t1_dv21qqd	1	*	13 RDO's 13 Public Holidays 20 Days annual Leave  Thats 46 days.  throw 6 sickies in (they are at full pay), and you have 52 days off a year, for an average 32 hour work week.
t1_dv2snzk	1	*	its same really just bigger numbers
t1_dv0ictj	0	*	Korea definitely allows dual citizenship. As of 2010, anyway (not sure if you renounced yours prior to that though). 
t1_dv0x726	1	*	Scratch fast food, almost any quick and easy meal seems to run you into health issues.
t1_dv0i8et	0	*	How?
t1_dv1zgcp	1	*	Agreed. 
t1_dv0grtd	1	*	Im only going off of what the professor and textbook said.
t1_dv0tvyr	1	*	You're right. I had to make a quick comment :D 
t1_dv10ruo	0	*	In Korea, if you won't give 100%, they'll find someone who will.
t1_dv1m8no	1	*	Oh, I hadn't noticed. Thanks for laying it out for me because until your comment I just couldn't fathom why we weren't given an extra day of pay for nothing.
t1_dv10twt	0	*	Then live like a bum on the street.  Your choice.
t1_dv1479q	1	*	Only if you are escaping american authorities for desertion and fighting on the side of the terrorists.
t1_dv1mud9	0	*	Telling your boss what he or she should do with their own company.
t1_dtdigb2	1	*	More like says someone who actually knows what their talking about...
t1_dupl1b6	1	*	I don't know, but New Jersey is the largest arm pit.
t1_dupvp6i	1	*	Sympathies for the lives lost and to the families.  It's pointless and senseless.  Sometimes the best way to deal with a bully is to defend yourself.  God forbid they provoke us to attack.
t1_duqbgtq	0	*	Right, as long as all those nukes stay silo'd. And they won't
t1_dupl5ua	0	*	Better hope for the new 64E model and low winds than.
t1_dtxmefe	0	*	You misunderstood. I wasnt saying the US didnt do those things, I was saying that it *is* taught in most US history classes.
t1_dt2faom	1	*	Americans yes, but Israelis? No. Americans run the world and have a duty to run it well. An Israeli kid isn't gonna do much outside of is real 
t1_dt3h2fb	0	*	Just as I thought - you don't know.  Look up Ex Nihilo, genius...
t1_duweg06	0	*	No some literally just don't want any immigration, not necessarily because of *multiculturalism* but because they hate anyone that's not them. 
t1_du5tiyv	1	*	You wanna buy a duck?
t1_du4luij	1	*	Word of mouth isn't actually as good as a Super Bowl spot.
t1_du4luxi	0	*	Word of mouth isn't actually as good as a Super Bowl spot.
t1_du4v9vu	1	*	I posted without finishing my sentence. What I meant to say was No, rewarding early adopters is not a normal thing to do for something that doesn't profit the creators.
t1_du4jgwv	0	*	>Sure, but a government can print more IOUs than it can honour.   Nnnno, you're thinking of bank loans.
t1_du5h5lo	0	*	Isn't this obvious?? The miner will stress out your CPU. Potentionally slowing your system and puting CPU unecessarily under load. What else do you think the mining scripts do? 
t1_dsusnt2	0	*	Nope, sources plz. On every single fucking claim and how Trump is so awesome and great that he can make it happen while doing nothing on his own. Thx again.
t1_dsusznv	0	*	Sources please. If you are going to cite all that info in public, then you are going to have to source it to back it up.
t1_dsuzc2g	1	*	The person making claims brings the sources.
t1_duyzx0m	1	*	List exists.. but I wouldn't go far as to claim that this guy is definitely on it when you have no proof of it. That's straight up fiction. Get lost man.
t1_duiaj3l	1	*	Philly has had some deadly incidents. Most recently in 2009 when people from Fishtown killed a visiting fan in the parking lot 
t1_dupbh3l	0	*	Not because they did it first; because they did it TOO. These are not mutually exclusive concepts/reasons. This is really hard for you to understand!
t1_duizsby	0	*	yes you're probably correct about all that... however, China makes our corruption look like peanuts... at least we have real electoral campaigns to donate to. 
t1_dsnvyxr	0	*	Exactly  Easy to steal once it's all gathered and organized. The nsa did the hard part. You have officially agreed with the counterpoint. Have a good day. 
t1_dsorqln	1	*	Or any other USB on the network to be connected and copy over to that.

t1_dsn63jx	0	*	The existence of Russia is not an excuse for our government's failures. 
t1_dtoajgn	0	*	hahahaha are you a real person?
t1_dtp56zb	1	*	The only thing right russian propaganda talking points is alt-right.  
t1_dto63am	1	*	We are all Canadian on this blessed day.

t1_dsceah1	0	*	Fair enough. But even if only 1/4 are acceptable that's still 40 videos.
t1_dv3urbf	0	*	That's all well and good. But if you google either name, you get the same flag. So I'm pretty sure it's just different spelling of the same place 
t1_dtiqf09	0	*	Trying to pretend that they can be offset by prohibition is also naive 
t1_dsq2iun	0	*	That is assuming in the future the US dollar is still the currency of choice. If the Euro or Yuan takes over, lots of issues with the whole just print some more money tactic will arise
t1_dsqf3lg	0	*	It's not the same. But it can default  https://www.thebalance.com/u-s-debt-default-3306295
t1_dsqncow	1	*	yep, you're right, i'll edit that to make it clear. I had the terms switched.

t1_dujafmh	1	*	What the hell does that have to do with litteraly anything?
t1_dujgk5g	1	*	What? Just tell us what you want to say.
t1_ds1ejpv	0	*	I don't think that guy knows anything about the region or the history of the DPRK.
t1_ds1cst3	1	*	It's a 50 success rate with one interceptor. We launch quite a few at the same target iirc. So that success rate is 50 per missile 
t1_ds1c07k	1	*	The problem is the reload time
t1_ds16b51	0	*	> Mueller is a republican   I thought he was a yogurt? 
t1_ds14gxy	0	*	Would the radiation affect Boston? This information influences whether or not I am willing to bet LA on it.
t1_ds163r9	0	*	Who is Amon?
t1_ds1d23t	1	*	Because ratheon wants to sell the products and therefore open alot of information about GMD and the EKV.
t1_ds14xog	1	*	All squares are rectangles, not all rectangles are squares.  Yes, all ICBMs are ballistic missiles, but a system designed to shoot ballistic missiles is not necessarily tested against ICBMs.
t1_ds15whu	1	*	Russia got pissed when the US tried to put a missile defense installation in Poland. 
t1_ds14v68	0	*	This guy nukes.
t1_ds1bln9	1	*	Plus the weapons in all the North Korean images (granted or may be misinformation) are not capable of ballistic re-entry 
t1_ds14jlu	0	*	They go far beyond what we'd normally consider the edge of the atmosphere, several times higher than the orbit of the Space Station.
t1_ds1fdcu	1	*	> They havent always said they wont attack unless attacked   >yes they have   >article linking them threatening preemptive nuclear strike on the US  What logic am I not following here?

t1_ds18gon	1	*	Think I just watched a video that explained the idea.  Here we go: https://youtu.be/4xbFVdoRzLQ
t1_ds1ed7h	0	*	FOX wishes that was true. They bend narrative to their bias, vs CNN that views the news from a biased perspective.  It's not the same because one of them isn't just making shit up
t1_ds1dwwr	0	*	Yea because Reuters actually wants you to read the article and develop a nuanced understanding of the topic, rather than just spouting bullshit based on simply reading a headline. 
t1_ds171ct	1	*	Yes that's called propaganda.
t1_ds1729r	0	*	Question out of ignorance, but even if a system like aegis destroys a nuke isn't there still fall out...?
t1_ds165y8	0	*	Oh shoosh you leftie.
t1_ds18lce	0	*	You are extremely ignorant of history if you think using nuclear weapons against China at any point was a good idea.  Pay more attention in history class you pot-stirring fuck.

t1_ds1cug8	1	*	Think that cowpie is hard?  Ill bet you a dollar it is.  Go step in it!
t1_ds1b59f	0	*	Only because the Japanese surrendered. More would have been dropped if the hadnt done so.
t1_ds173re	1	*	So, the US bases in Japan would be the ones to shoot the missiles down, no?
t1_ds116nk	1	*	Ahh, the height of intellectual discourse

t1_ds17xvy	1	*	~~I am all Ameri~~ Yeesh, what a horrible idea.
t1_ds13hlm	0	*	Mmm, maybe some writers, especially opinions. But the NYT-WaPo one-two punches have been very effective. Can't really say WaPo doesn't do some good investigation. 
t1_ds17x7i	0	*	It's not Canada anymore if the United States calls it the United States. The United States used to be called Great Britain, Spain and France. Didn't mean much after we took it and called it America.
t1_ds171zm	1	*	You would've preferred for hundreds of millions to die in a war instead? 
t1_ds17wlm	1	*	AEGIS is cool if we can somehow keep the US Navy from playing boat cuddles with foreign ships
t1_ds1vqix	1	*	Ok, they can write and publish what they want, but country censors it from the people. They can still write and publish.
t1_ds18k43	1	*	Yes, I think they were; when China overtly entered the Korean war there was a real danger of the conflict going nuclear. 
t1_ds5ytw5	0	*	and?
t1_ds19on2	0	*	I mean most younger people do get their news from Stephen Colbert or the daily show.
t1_ds19i09	1	*	Right, they would have died in the blast, or better yet, in horrible pain from radiation poisoning. 
t1_ds17ybu	0	*	don't forget there can be a multiple reentry vehicle, not with just decoys but real warheads and they can change trajectory  at least advanced icbm could do this. 
t1_ds1n1bw	0	*	We were justified in using them when we did it. Don't compare the USA to NK you look silly and people won't take you seriously.
t1_ds1dgrl	1	*	Amon did some things wrong... But I fucking love your username <3

t1_ds14hnm	0	*	There are a lot of different types of ballistic missiles that arent inter-continental. ICBMs travel extremely fast in their descent phase. 
t1_ds1rbj7	1	*	China is a wildcard but in the event of DPRK starting the war, theyd probably stay out of it. I cant imagine China risking a nuclear war with the United States to help the DPRK invade the South. 
t1_ds14h03	1	*	There's a difference between SRBMs and ICBMs though. It can't hit the latter which are objects flying in from space at 6000kph.
t1_ds1dalp	0	*	So you admit your original comment was pointless?  If they get attacked it wont be a nuclear strike.

t1_dsqx63g	0	*	There is definitely a few unique places, and some very very minor differences in the rest, but As a whole, compared to Europe, the US is nowhere even close to as diverse as Europe.

t1_dv37mhe	1	*	Oh yea, I agree there.  The Republicans would have kept control of the legislative branch and we would have spun our wheels for 4 years.
t1_dv2nc7x	0	*	Some Trump supporters were previously for Bernie too though. A lot of Trump supporters were who Bernie was trying to help...

t1_dv366aj	0	*	Skyrocket to 18 trillion dollars? How does that math work out?  Obama hadnt worked on a budget more than $200,000 when he become president. He had no clue what he was doing. Zero experience. 
t1_dv2tpyi	0	*	How is he not?  He's not droning children in countries the US is jot at war with.  He's not arming rebels to take down stable governments that keep the real crazy Islamic terrorists in check. 
t1_dv3kg8z	1	*	Right, but you can't lump all libertarians in with Republicans because a few of them have libertarian tendencies. I'm not sure your point here bud. 
t1_dv2si0g	1	*	I was just pointing out that it takes ~20-21 hours to drive from Toronto to Florida but ~22 hours to drive from Toronto to Winnipeg (if you don't cross the border).

t1_dtum13p	1	*	Huh. Well then, that's that.   I wonder how that question is actually phrased/asked. *...based strictly on the law.* is open to interpretation. 
t1_dtujkc7	0	*	Investigation of the crime I understand, surely reading about the legal system itself wouldn't be against the rules.

t1_duw0r1m	0	*	No no Im saying cities, counties and state agencies are not waiting for the market (or the federal government), theyre taking active steps. Yes its not enough yet but its encouraging.

t1_dux4r2s	0	*	They're reducing **the rate at which their pollution increases**. That's not the same as decreasing overall pollution, which they're not doing at all. 
t1_duwo620	1	*	My fave is that conservation saves money and whatever minor inconvenience it causes is more than offset by the savings.
t1_duwl3zs	0	*	We would need about 4 earths then
t1_duw6yq5	0	*	Of course.  My point is simply that throwing 30k at a dog isnt worth it when it deprives 10,000 others of vision.  The same might be true for climate change.
t1_duwytvb	0	*	What is it about humans that makes them entitled to more rights than animals?  Farm animals do not have jobs at all. They're effectively slaves.
t1_dux98pv	0	*	But why does it matter? I don't think the atmosphere cares where it's 1 person causing the pollution or 300 million. It's the same pollution
t1_duw0wmx	0	*	Chinas foresight might seem cruel, but theyre smart. They know what theyre doing, and thats why theyre building so much infrastructure for renewable energy.

t1_duwk9g0	1	*	Huh. Interesting.
t1_dux96sk	0	*	But I just honestly don't see why per capita matters. The atmosphere doesn't care how many people are emitting the pollution
t1_duwir33	0	*	Uh, the world did not beat up china. Mao did. He forced isolationism for decades. Specifically the decades in which the rest of the world improved substatially.

t1_du7ezvo	0	*	Those priests were probably liberals.
t1_du6tms9	0	*	Youll have to argue that with someones whose actually been thru the therapy.  Flat out calling them liars is not a good idea. They did it, they lived it. Bring it up with one of them.
t1_du78fxw	0	*	He has said that it's a choice. And if you don't think being gay should be permissible in society how do you call that being accepting or tolerant? Nor is that a reasonable position.
t1_du6u0lj	1	*	Gay Conversion Therapy can be considered torture to some, and a good thing to others.  Its not universally torture.

t1_ds24d9v	0	*	Again this doesn't prove she is an anti-semite or that she thinks Russia is better than Isreal. So if she performs in any state (US too) that has done anything bad she can't condemn another state? 
t1_ds1yq0p	0	*	That quote most certainly is from Hamas's founding charter, but you're completely depriving it of the context which u/iluvucorgi mentioned when you misrepresent it as a call for genocide.

t1_dt2llol	0	*	Nope, I saw that, but we`re talking about the 33% in america, which is *considered* to be in the developed world, so adding that into the quote is completely redundant.  
t1_dt2orew	1	*	Its smug aura mocks me.
t1_dt76j4l	0	*	Catholicism bears little resemblance to apostolic Christianity. It is a more corrupt version of it, with unbiblical things like purgatory now being accepted.

t1_dtr86hs	0	*	You ignored his argument because of where he posts. Thats not fair, America is not going to get far in the future if we cant start communicating with each other. 
t1_dtqsu20	0	*	The US has taken in close to 4 million refugees since 1980, on top of all of the legal and illegal immigration since then.  I think we have more than pulled our weight.
t1_dtr50n1	1	*	Fuck em all to death! ~Mr Garrison (Trump)
t1_dtqy6v2	1	*	More than you understand.

t1_dtrl978	1	*	> Canada doesn't really prevent illegal immigration  Do you really know what the fuck you're talking about?
t1_dtqgtcp	0	*	I would be interested in a study like that that's for sure.
t1_dtqcxqe	0	*	Then why complain about people that are working to change it?
t1_dtqlec0	1	*	We'd like to have our country be like Canada too. With a strict immigration system and automatic and speedy deportation for illegals.
t1_dtqosn6	0	*	Yeah man, referring to those things you chose to post are assassinating your sterling character. 
t1_durf0sc	0	*	Sorry. 
t1_dt9yn4f	1	*	The tries to tie OTC availability with insurance coverage are just a bunch of moronic excuses. Those are completely unrelated issues.
t1_dtb05g5	1	*	So, I'm right, but... I'm not if you put words in my mouth?
t1_dtfmmr8	1	*	> Wasn't being too serious  HURR DURR I DISAGREE WITH THE PREMISE OF YOUR JOKE YOU'RE ACTUALLY TOTALLY WRONG FUCK YOU!!!  I hope you're a little more enjoyable in person.
t1_dta22bc	1	*	You're welcome. It is etched into my brain.
t1_dtx19xe	1	*	This guy gets it
t1_dt9zdbf	0	*	You are openly cheering for the continued mutilation of 10,000 victims a year [edit: in the 10,000 **botched** circs per year] . If they were girls, you would be on the side of stopping it.   
t1_dt96sbj	0	*	It's different. As you said earlier (I think it was you), they are not equal. Removing the clit isn't the same as removing foreskin.
t1_dtgjny2	1	*	Why would I block you if I know you're wrong? I'm trying to convince you that you're wrong. Are you really that afraid of being incorrect?
t1_dt9pltc	1	*	Nope.
t1_dt8wpzo	0	*	That your comparison sucked
t1_dt9jddw	0	*	I'll stick with the top health authorities over random anonymous people online. You sound like an antivaxxer.

t1_dtfa9zn	0	*	So you'd be totally fine with someone buying meat from free-range animals.
t1_dtg48pv	0	*	Now Im confused. Are you talking about eating a person or eating a Jew. Because you have implied that the two are not the same. 
t1_dtepui5	0	*	Considering the definition of murder is unlawfulling killing of another human, it is pretty easy to claim eating non-human meat is not murder.
t1_dsfbivc	0	*	No, in reality. 
t1_dug87uc	1	*	UN Peacekeeper for example? I mean its their job to report such things
t1_duftel4	0	*	Maybe, but even this embarrassment on the Israelis side was enough to keep the border quiet for more than 10 years straight. 
t1_duihysf	0	*	I never said there wasn't, I said there has been 3 moves to statehood. But the last one would have removed most settlements
t1_duh8v81	1	*	Is that an analogy too?
t1_dtmsvdb	1	*	Thanks for the spelling reminder, very poor show on my part.   As to the shootings, I really don't know any stats so I shall assume you're right and just shut up!
t1_dsgnvhy	0	*	That's a big call, considering it was the Russians who backed the original invasion, but I hope you are right for all of our sake.
t1_dto7pwo	1	*	How so?
t1_dtobxuu	0	*	A change that might be 170 times faster than average. There's no way to say for certain,  because data of this kind wasn't collected prior to the industrial revolution.

t1_dv5pxan	0	*	What?
t1_dv57gf2	0	*	Sadly, its probably necessary when you consider how well-armed our criminals are. The whole situation is wrong.
t1_dv4ngf5	1	*	I read the article.
t1_dv4eoj6	1	*	What do you mean would I allow? I don't think they intentionally flashbanged the baby. 
t1_dv4t7jz	0	*	But it's not a HE-F grenade, which is what is most commonly referred to as a grenade. Stun-grenades are are known colloquially as flashbangs. 
t1_dv4gdk3	1	*	I'm not talking religion per se, I just wonder how many ethic Israelis are in the USA 
t1_dv4ydsn	0	*	You've been in a lot of violent situations in your life?
t1_dv4qra9	0	*	Why don't we ask the SWAT team in the US what happens to them?
t1_dv4gfos	0	*	> Stun grenades arent non-lethal, theyre less-lethal.  OK Fine. But normal grenades are really-lethal so maybe stick to the facts.
t1_dv4ke0r	1	*	Oh man you should hear how real friends talk in person bot its a lot worse than that 
t1_dv43tru	1	*	The truth is bad enough though, why muddle it? I feel we could do a great service to the story by being concise.
t1_dv4p06i	0	*	Have you ever been in a riot or seen videos of riots? The crowd retreats, then comes back, this cycle can go for hours, sometimes days in really large riots.
t1_dsudl2p	1	*	You just gave me one more reason to hit the booze tonight buddy.  And that's Sad Booze, not Happy Booze.
t1_dsuh3o2	1	*	What's the difference? You still have to deal with pigs and cows in both.
t1_dstwzie	0	*	He said he was making around $40 an hour, that was over a year ago when I spoke to him but he didn't say anything about a northern living allowance or bonus.  
t1_dsu5pbr	0	*	> Except that Christians in India follow that. >  >   That doesn't come from their own religious doctrine though. They can adopt Hindu customs in the same way European Christians adopted pagan ones.

t1_dsvh3bm	0	*	We *waste* more food every day than we would need to feed the entire planet.  We could increase our meat consumption and still feed everyone. It's an issue of distribution.

t1_dufwc9r	0	*	I wasnt trying to say they did or didnt have it. I was only pointing out that Retard didnt apply in GPWS situation. 
t1_duftvd4	1	*	They could have used the dead bodies as sleds and go down the mountain.
t1_dufr88b	0	*	All he's saying is that prop pilots are generally more inexperienced and in planes less ideal for bad conditions. Why are you taking it so personally? 
t1_dug7bk0	1	*	Youre inability to understand scientific data makes this discussion to anecdotal for me to engage any further. :) have a Great day.
t1_dufz43u	1	*	>Race is irrelevant but age and gender are relevant.   In this case its just another way to narrow the demographic, not outright racism.   That said, the comment is just blind stereotyping.

t1_dug00rp	1	*	The thing is if that ever happens the public would probably never know that even happened. 
t1_dug6opl	0	*	I know what Im doing.  Im a good driver.  I only send short text messages anyways.  Its the fault of these *idiots* that text and drive, not a good driver like me.  Right?

t1_dug9939	0	*	Oh my god! Did she at least feel bad about it or was she one of those who acts like it's everyone else's fault?
t1_dugg1h3	1	*	You are correct. I incorrectly used overspeed (which has a specific meaning) when I meant time to reduce throttle to slow down.   Thanks for clarifying. 
t1_dufrrld	0	*	well i'd doubt that slowing down works when you are about to hit a moutain

t1_dugspde	0	*	You would rather ride without a seatbelt because it gives you a better chance of being thrown from the car?
t1_dug3rwy	1	*	Next time tell her not text and drive while you're in the car. It might make them mad but it's your life man, take care of it. 
t1_dugctq5	0	*	Youre totally right, and I know that - but I am in therapy and on meds because for some reason I cant feel that way yet. Working on it! But its hard for me to actually put in action.

t1_dt0xku6	0	*	So if a man goes into a coma he isn't human? You are ending the life to a human that is going to be born, that is still murder.
t1_dtbrg3g	1	*	Jokes on you, you already pay more to make up for the uninsured that bail on payment.
t1_dtbrgpx	1	*	No one does, until it's their fucking moron child.
t1_dtbrdj1	1	*	What about the bank bailout? 
t1_dtbs2db	1	*	They are modes of thinking left over from the Cold War. Popular opinion is shifting.

t1_dtbl5xv	0	*	Jesus. I was about to give you a rather hostile history lesson before you turned that comment around.
t1_dtbs7gm	1	*	Social programs does not mean socialism. I get your point but lets be real here. 
t1_dtbkjta	1	*	You literally are doing what I just posted, LOL.
t1_dtbo3j1	0	*	Liberals get mad easily. Im really enjoying this 
t1_dtdu5vk	0	*	Yeah, I'm going to trust some random the_donald poster over the US Intelligence agencies. Go sell propaganda somewhere else, we're all full up here.
t1_dtbla6y	0	*	So predictable
t1_dtbp3wv	0	*	Well on the contraction part he is technically right. An ex of a shortening would be what I just did with example also known as an abbreviation, but who cares this article is retarded.
t1_dtkyll6	1	*	Try again. Trumps still president and youre still crying on Reddit. U0001f62dufe0f
t1_dtbpx7m	0	*	Yeah! All those greedy Governments need to keep there hands off of corporations hard extorted dollars!!
t1_dtbzplc	0	*	You do realize that history and reality are on a collision course with your stupidity. And I did write collision not collusion.
t1_dtcbyi8	0	*	In general.  Notice I didn't say all religious people or anything; just evangelicals.
t1_dtbrkxw	0	*	The problem is that it's ultimately a cheaper system for you than the one we have currently. So annoyed feelings at morons aside, the most prudent financial choice is typically universal healthcare. 
t1_dtbpvp2	0	*	Canada has the Progressive Conservatives!  Spoiler: there aren't progressive
t1_dtbtn5n	1	*	Last public statement he made said he was very unhappy with Trump. 
t1_dtbqxmy	1	*	He probably has a visa.

t1_dsv5yv1	0	*	It's almost like small populations who are all similar to eachother in most ways will agree on things.  And can afford stuff when they don't have much of a place on the world stage.
t1_dsv20ht	1	*	Because of his prior opinions, he needed to demonstrate that he learned from the mistakes that were made in Venezuela so that he wouldn't make those kinds of mistakes.   
t1_dsvgcy2	0	*	>What would you call most of Europe?  Capitalist.
t1_dsizdhd	0	*	If you say so. Obviously, you're the expert here. At least when it comes to the antagonize the locals as much as possible approach.

t1_dso6zvg	1	*	Which is why its a good thing the FCC gave up regulatory powers back to the FTC because they can actually do something about monopolies. 
t1_dsnuypx	1	*	....yes it does. If you haven't even read the second amendment, you can't say you support it
t1_dso7565	0	*	Why are you terrified to answer the question?
t1_dsn7513	0	*	Poor people who cant afford healthcare??  Who are they?  Puerto Ricans??  You blaming the hurricane on trump too??  Oh lawd!!!  Yeah, you desperately reaching 
t1_dsn62lx	0	*	Funny, I was thinking the same about you.  Again like I said..  things have been pretty good since him becoming POTUS.    
t1_dsnnm04	1	*	Point out any 14 months that the economy performed as well or made similar gains under Obama. You have 8 years to choose from to beat the only 14 months he's had since elected. Go
t1_dsnjpun	1	*	If we didn't have to live with the consequences of their gullibility, it would be hysterical. 
t1_dsr6wse	1	*	Haha no problem
t1_dsoscst	0	*	And according to your graph the net result is still a surplus for me..  so, when its all done Im still keeping more money I earned as a result of the tax cut..  Problem??  
t1_dsnhpeo	0	*	Dunno if you remember but the current president lost the popular vote aka the will of the people. Yet the electoral college chose Trump. That's undemocratic 
t1_dsnvpvq	1	*	Because trump lost the election. 
t1_dso1ppr	0	*	Uh, yes I am.  Feels good too
t1_dsnnqfo	0	*	Source?
t1_dsn6zms	0	*	No clue, like I said things have been pretty good since him becoming potus..  I couldnt care less of the mean words he says on twitter as long as things keep improving as they are in the country..
t1_dso921g	0	*	You people keep acting like it doesn't. 
t1_dsny3je	0	*	So what, the Party of European Socialists should kick out the Norwegian Labor Party then?  Do you want to tell them or should I?
t1_dso1o2g	1	*	You should elaborate on how that's relevant.
t1_dsnyx0r	1	*	The market was up for 7 of the last 8 years.
t1_dso0sbz	1	*	By the way snopes is not a valid source, it's like me quoting my crazy grandparents.
t1_dsnnnri	0	*	And continued to improve under trump at a much better rate..  Thanks none the less.  I did realize anyone was making the argument that wasnt the case with obama
t1_dso4s0k	0	*	How is he? Look at how the markets moved in the last decade. He had no influence at all. 
t1_dsng4ny	0	*	You are such an entitled smug little bitch.
t1_dsos44n	1	*	i dont know why my comment was deleted... I was just telling that dude to be nice when disagreeing with people.. 
t1_dsnajm4	0	*	It's quite good at hiding how democratic it is if the will of the people is disregarded. By your logic, The USSR and North Korea are democratic because hey, they got to vote for their leader.
t1_dsng6s6	0	*	They have fully committed to falling for everything.
t1_dsq5oym	1	*	Time will tell but there is nothing to indicate that outside of your bigoted hatred of Trump.
t1_dso1mte	0	*	Both at their best under trump..  Thank you 
t1_dsphgvd	1	*	Yeah it's communism 
t1_dsnhew1	0	*	Uhh, I guess you missed the part were those bonuses went out along with raises huh??  Ooh!! Major oversight on your part not fully knowing the topic being discussed..
t1_dsnj7o3	1	*	I can respect that, have my upvote. not your comment elsewhere, but your redirecting me to it, that i can respect.
t1_dsnw45f	0	*	Wrong. He lost by 3 million. I know people who like Trump aren't big on reality though. 
t1_dsoalk7	0	*	Are you a liberal on the following topics:  Healthcare, banking regulations, minimum wage, weed, gay marriage?
t1_dsnrkvu	0	*	Really, speculation of future regulatory actions has no impact on an economy's growth?
t1_dsnxaey	0	*	alas, you are right about that.  as an outside observer the next few years are gonna be very entertaining, the last year was already quite funny.
t1_dsn9u5o	0	*	Again, how has it effected your everyday life.    I didnt ask theoretically how it could possibly..  Lots of will, should, could, mights there..
t1_dsntjo6	0	*	I agree they should help new competing companies form and get rid of any government deals that give big players an advantage.
t1_dsnxhqg	0	*	Absolutely not true at all.  Maybe you should actually look into it and not trust the liberal equivalent to conservative talk radio.
t1_dsny3i7	1	*	You prefer trump over hillary? I would have liked to see bernie but it was not meant to be.
t1_dtycvcl	0	*	As a percentage of overall crime murder is insignificant compared to littering. That's your point?  As an effect on society murder is the one. Littering not so much. 
t1_dsljif7	0	*	black 95%, mulatto and white 5%   Contemporary usage of the term mulatto in Haiti is applied to thexa0bourgeoisie, pertaining to high social and economic stature.  
t1_durrjrs	0	*	Possibly! Haven't been there a whole lot though. 
t1_dutub3z	1	*	It was clear to those with any intellectual capacity 
t1_duvl6ge	1	*	LOL sorry it was meant for  /u/RipCopper.  GEB is an excellent recommendation. As close to the Red Pill in The Matrix as possible.
t1_du17ywo	0	*	AHEM.  Sexual abuser? I'm sorry but groping != sexual abuse. It's harassment, sure, but calling it abuse goes a bit too far.
t1_du4n5tb	0	*	And it seems to have worked. 
t1_du2zpki	1	*	>I really don't understand the let's-be-a-snide-person impulse I see on Reddit so often.  Because when you act in public like how he does on the internet, you get punched in your stupid fucking mouth.
t1_du10x3e	0	*	Riiiiight.... So you have no idea what you are even trying to say?     Brainwashed drones... 
t1_du3g5mb	1	*	Well also a direct threat in telling us that they are going to be able to nuke us one day soon, while openly working towards that ability.  
t1_du1vtka	1	*	Russians made you do it.
t1_du1qqip	0	*	They're not the British Isles, lift with the knees when moving the goalposts.  Bellend.

t1_du1fut4	0	*	> what fucking projected motivations? You were championing one of the worst murderous dictators   There you go again.  
t1_du19i93	0	*	So youre trying to preempt his subconscious whataboutism by using some textbook Soviet-era whataboutism yourself? You don't see the issue there?
t1_du1rlr7	0	*	Trump is basically an uncool version of President Camacho.
t1_dspvase	0	*	No capacities are for fire codes. A floor should be able to hold a truck easily even if its not gonna need to. Someone mustve taken out a major support beam here
t1_dspqhou	0	*	2 inch beams, 8 year old laborers, problem solved!
t1_dspn8j4	0	*	3.5. 
t1_dspr9tv	0	*	why would you watch this
t1_dspneyh	0	*	A whole stock exchange dropping that much is a huge deal when you see it. Usually indicates that there is some very wrong happening at the country level or greater.
t1_dspy1ur	0	*	First, they teach that to everyone that is involved in any sort of construction, and second, why would civils be doing anything with timber?
t1_dspn2bl	0	*	Feeling superior much? Is your life that miserable you have to put other humans down or below you?
t1_dspme3b	1	*	Your lack of reaction disappoints me.
t1_dspgvm9	1	*	Is not that bad. Indonesian TV very graphic actually

t1_dspssjh	0	*	If you have to ask, no.
t1_dspt374	1	*	I had the same thought yesterday when people were saying horrible thing about Muslims, does this person even know about Indonesia
t1_dspkuz7	0	*	Its a word that gets sometimes spelled out over multiple comments one letter each when someone starts posting 'F' instead of saying Rip or anything more contributing to the thread.
t1_dv2k656	1	*	Haha sorry! The math still probably holds up for burning a dollars worth of Technic/mind storm pieces too
t1_dv2k1j2	0	*	Hey!
t1_dt849ql	1	*	Women tend to work less hours, and take time off for kids. It's as simple as that. 
t1_dt8togm	1	*	Sure I could agree to that.
t1_dt8m8g4	0	*	You are correct doesn't mean I can't be sympathetic to the mass death that could come from that. My whole argument is that Palestinian should maybe change thier stance to prevent that exact situation.
t1_dt8nm34	1	*	You're on to something. Wish Palestinians understood this. Unfortunately they listen to bad advice and eagerly follow it
t1_dt8pv8j	0	*	> 80% actually. According to wikipedia, there about 5 million UNRWA registered Palestinians refugees.  ...and about 20,000 who were actually displaced.
t1_dt8uede	0	*	What a load of nonsense. No country in the world administers DNA tests to figure out who owns a piece of land. 
t1_dt8q81p	1	*	Literally the only thing that matters when it comes to rightful land ownership is who owns the land and whether they can keep it. Might makes right as it has for literally all of human existance 
t1_dt9l29w	1	*	Yes, but nobody wants to start a nuclear war. It's on a different scale.
t1_dtcj320	1	*	At least we know what Pakistan has! What nukes Israel have?
t1_dt8gxk1	0	*	If you look at other racial or national conflicts over space or resources in modern history one side usually attempts a genocide. Rwanda is a good example. So is the Holocaust.
t1_dt9ss8f	0	*	And the civilians who were not part of this and not doing these things deserve death because..?
t1_dt8k9p4	1	*	*paging theresa may and benjamin netanyahu*
t1_dt8izek	1	*	Most neighbours wouldn't be able to eradicate each other without suffering alot of retaliation. 
t1_dt9jeqs	0	*	I thought it was an act of war when Egypt blockaded Israel? 
t1_dt9qi43	1	*	The thing about nukes is that you aren't meant to use them. The world ends otherwise.
t1_dsr6o1u	1	*	it's like sprinkles on a cupcake
t1_dsr5zxz	0	*	Can confirm, diatomaceous earth is amazing against bed bugs. It irritates your nose but it is definitely much more preferable than getting eaten by bed bugs.
t1_dsr97fl	1	*	exterminators probably don't like DE because it's cheap, easy, and kills any insect that has an oily exoskeleton (pretty much all of them). 
t1_dsr6bf4	1	*	Just hasn't heard of them here. Kind of like we don't talk about issues with termites.
t1_dsrd5lk	0	*	Only Sweden? Really? I'm Swedish but... It's lovely.
t1_dufkdgk	1	*	Thank you but that is not what i meant
t1_dudxfps	0	*	I'm not wasting any more of my time explaining what every word in the dictionary means.
t1_dudth0p	1	*	sorry, I miss typed that one. I meant bad enough. Good was suppose to be a qualifier for the extreeme, but I see how that would be confusing. 
t1_duq2a5r	0	*	I mean, I would've thought we'd be able to agree that the side that wants to perpetrate a genocide would be worse, no?
t1_duwhe4u	0	*	Tell me this, have you ever even been to China? Also, trust me, your country won't adopt China's governing system then.
t1_duo36s8	1	*	Our GDP has increased greatly in the last fifty years, and wages haven't come close to reflecting that growth. The probable cause is globalism and capital freedom.
t1_dumgaqz	1	*	> ...life plus 70 years or 95 or 120 years, depending on the nature of authorship.   This is straight from the [Copyright Office](https://www.copyright.gov/circs/circ15a.pdf)
t1_du31xjm	0	*	And their own support for terrorism drops towers in addition to suicide bombings and those countries goals on the geopolitical stage. Yet Saudi-Arabia has the moral high ground how exactly?
t1_du27i2f	1	*	Thanks.
t1_dv461ow	0	*	No, more like someone outraged at the inequality in our society resorting to illegal means to try and help the underpriviledged.
t1_dt76es5	1	*	What the hell are you on about?
t1_dt2ius8	0	*	Some random youtube video doesn't disprove my point...
t1_dt2nt0t	0	*	It's one of many examples that MSM refused to vet.
t1_dt2jpgt	0	*	Existence sucks. I eagerly await the return to the void.  
t1_dtgkp0m	0	*	But when their country doesn't even have one of them.  Thankfully I don't live in such a barbaric country.
t1_dth3o2r	1	*	I didn't say it wasn't a fact...? And yes, the only point I was putting out was, There are hellish parts of the US as well, and that you recognise that, there is nothing else for me to argue about :) 
t1_dulvdun	0	*	Yes... so why would we want workers without good unions and how does that make cops special? I dont want special treatment for cops. 
t1_dum03uq	0	*	The private sector also doesn't pay people to not work. So neither should the police. 
t1_dumvzay	1	*	I dont presume to know alternate timelines...
t1_dsa4j5n	0	*	There are almost no whites in Liberia. Do you have a source for it being extremely racist?  (Apart from the citizenship thing, which is just a form of jus sanguinis)
t1_dsbd7zr	0	*	Israel is not *only* the Jewish state. A remarkable Christian and Muslim (usually Arab) minorities live in the country as well. Not all Israelis are Jewish.  
t1_ds9uq7g	0	*	So the law says that German citizens are lesser people? That their action deserve lesser punishment because they are less capable of being responsible?
t1_dsarat4	0	*	If you're saying open borders, wouldn't that mean millions of (real) jew-haters moving into the area of israel?
t1_dsaixhw	0	*	They're sent to special detention centres, awaiting trial (which can take months), then deported.  I'd be worried if that wasn't the case. You need judicial oversight in a democratic country.
t1_dsb9p2g	0	*	> Sure it does   No, it doesn't.  See: OP
t1_ds9txwt	0	*	No, using that logic you have the same right to own a bedroom as I do.
t1_dsacicr	0	*	Being against the goals and wishes of a group seems to me to be the very definition of anti-groupname.
t1_dsa9k2i	1	*	There is some conspiracy about the separation of power by Charles-Louis de Secondat...
t1_dsb3m1v	0	*	self hatred is still racism.
t1_dsaredl	0	*	The holocaust happened half a century ago in germany.  Wouldn't it be like allowing pro-slavery talk to go unpunished in the US, given slavery was even longer ago?
t1_dsa288d	0	*	> if you ever want to change somebody *over the internet by making anonymous comments*  what? sorry, no, i don't try to change people here. i don't even think these guys would be to.  
t1_dsaube7	0	*	i think it means OK
t1_dsa6r15	1	*	wow what a biased piece of propaganda, thanks for sharing!
t1_dsaf37c	0	*	How so? And I mean in Israel's case, not in some hypothetical case.
t1_dsa5vf3	0	*	That's not how words work. Antisemitic refers to hatred of Jews, it has nothing to do with Semitic languages. I suggest you be quiet now because you're really not being as clever as you think you are.
t1_dsa45ey	0	*	There are three branches of government. The judicial branch is one of those. This is 5th grade civics. If youre going to be pedantic, also try being correct
t1_dsambnr	0	*	I believe their government kind of has to yes. 
t1_dsa7bsc	0	*	> If anyone today was working to keep Liberia a specifically African American country    Not African-**American**, but you do have to be black to be a Liberian citizen. It's in their constitution. 
t1_dsa3ebp	0	*	So that would still make you pro Palestinian or pro Palestinian ROR. Anti Zionist means you don't think Israel has any right to exist in any form. 
t1_dsb6wel	0	*	Read your own source, they were primarily raided for incitement. You know, using hate to incite violence or discrimination   
t1_dsbbj9b	0	*	Most Arabs are Semites.   Ninja edit : but in context anti semitism is specifically related to Jews. 
t1_dsajonh	0	*	You mean the guy who made 'jokes' about gassing the jews and is likely to only received a fine if found guilty whatsoever?
t1_dscnki0	0	*	That's basically saying the native Americans had no right to their land, because they didn't have titles and deeds to it
t1_dsazcot	0	*	Well... no. That's poor reasoning skills.   Iran is a Muslim state. When they do something terrible, I don't say: The Muslims are doing XYZ
t1_dsage2c	1	*	Yes it's the separation of powers between the 3 branches of government. Of those the judiciary (judges) is one.
t1_dsbireg	1	*	Especially seeing how roughly half of those places voted against independence in their referendums.
t1_dsak9ls	1	*	Watch the video - he was asked about anti-zionism, and he answered about criticism of the actions of Israel.
t1_dsb8b3l	1	*	lol unfairly high standards, such as..Don't steal that people's land!
t1_duh0rik	0	*	I imagine just as easy as it is to get illegal drugs, just since thats the only frame of reference I can think of.
t1_ds33xo0	0	*	It's a little more than faith, it's the fact that the USA is a stable country that is very capable of enforcing it's tax laws, as evidenced by the many cases of them enforcing their tax laws.
t1_ds33j3x	0	*	So a deflationary currency could be good for the environment.

t1_duo20cw	1	*	You are suppose to eat the pancake then chugg the syrup.

t1_dunye7w	0	*	Where are you from? In the States, its not that unusual, or at least the Midwest.
t1_duo2p90	1	*	Well Ohio is more north than Texas

t1_dtn4srw	1	*	The entire world is upside down it seems
t1_dtmu7co	1	*	You misunderstood, I thought you were born Muslim the same as if you were born a Jew. Being a Jew can be applied to either be religiously or ethnically so.
t1_dtmyfao	0	*	What the fuck are you even talking about?
t1_dtmt70c	0	*	I'm pretty sure the CIA has had several discussions on the matter, to be perfectly realistic.

t1_dtn69e2	1	*	The Five Eyes network... ? 
t1_dtn41u6	1	*	What strawman argument? It's called an analogy.
t1_dtnpp2s	0	*	There's a man who has been in jail for years in the UK because he likes to walk around naked... The UK doesn't find that acceptable.  You're hypocrites who think your way is the only way.
t1_dtn495w	0	*	I literally said I couldnt care less what people wear or why they wear it, so long as its not forced in the thread you responded to.
t1_dtmthv0	0	*	Incredibly. No government so comfortable trampling personal autonomy should be respected or taken seriously.
t1_dtnqk9j	0	*	Maybe. But this falls pretty clearly into the oppression category. 
t1_dtnc61e	1	*	> proctoring  Did YOU bust out a thesaurus for that one? ;)
t1_dtn3vm8	1	*	Help who?  I don't want to offend anyone by assuming I know who you're talking about.
t1_dtn5e99	1	*	Thanks for all the info, my internet is spotty right now, but I'll look at the video later on.
t1_dtn2zta	0	*	I don't see how that contradicts my post, I agree with you. I just wasn't informed enough to discuss ISIS' twitter.
t1_dtnml1p	1	*	Thanks. I'm sick of all this division. 
t1_dtn3d0x	0	*	Depends.....there is/was a huge issues with orthodox jews attacking women for not covering up and the government not doing anything about it for a long ass time.

t1_dtnumsa	0	*	Maybe women should wear swastikas too then, since wearing something when you're told not to is empowering.
t1_dtnlcn6	0	*	Hijab means curtain and refers to Islamically modest dress codes in general, and also the scarf in particular sometimes. All are valid. 
t1_dtmttn2	0	*	It is if the government is dictating different dress codes for different classifications of people.

t1_dtnjy9k	0	*	> it's fucken bizarre.  Not really. Their house, their rules. Even if you disagree with them. Plus diplomacy is important. 
t1_dtnnjz0	1	*	Maybe, but surveys are based on who identified as Christian, and these guys are who identifies as such.
t1_dtnmvdo	1	*	Free market will fix itself. Socialism doesn't work. If people don't want to serve protected classes then they won't survive. 
t1_dtne5yj	0	*	No. Its not an opinion. 
t1_dtmzpst	0	*	Regardless, the Hadiths are still considered an inseparable part of sacred law.  The question is not only of The Koran but of Islam, and the Hadiths are a fundamental part of Islam.
t1_dtp0772	0	*	So you are ok with random violence, got it.
t1_dt414oc	0	*	Dude, the sarcasm was not in relation to the murder.
t1_ds923zj	0	*	> companies desire to uphold their image should not superceed the right of the individuals.   And that's where we disagree. Nothing else will come from this discussion.
t1_du29m6t	0	*	They are accused of ambushing some Turkish soldiers 25 years ago... how does this make them just like isis?
t1_du2wxwe	0	*	In my opinion you should look to the fact Irak has been divised in two and we have now way more tensions between all the ethnic communities living there.
t1_du1p9nj	0	*	And Russia just shared information that you're supporting terrorists here.
t1_dv2m2qy	1	*	Oh okay

t1_dsprrn3	0	*	the French had to pay back a greater war debt after the Franco-Prussian war of 1870, you don't see them starting genocidal wars of conquest over war debt, fuck off with this Nazi apologia.
t1_dspjus9	0	*	I guess I'm confused about how that's relevant to my original post, then.
t1_dsofi72	0	*	Because we got bullied into it... seriously do you know anything about what actually happened?
t1_dsou84x	1	*	You're correct, those who do so are simply ignorant and hopefully in a minority. In fact even Corbyn wouldn't argue against the WW2 point I bet but you'll find crazies everywhere.
t1_dsppwzj	0	*	LOL Carter sold us out.. humiliated round the world as an insurgency smaller than Vietnam drove us out. laughable.
t1_duo1aff	1	*	It's not death penalty either.
t1_duojxvn	1	*	Nice site! Unfortunately that info is buried within each incident report (arrgh), and mostly I'm finding that type of firearm and its source are unknown.  
t1_duo4jz2	0	*	Even better: Let's look at gun ownership and overall intentional homicide rates.  https://78.media.tumblr.com/0048549730a97d29f06581e17c901a89/tumblr_inline_p4gbwmSqxz1sodcqk_1280.png

t1_dunprje	0	*	People doing lots of private sales without getting an FFL and doing background checks are committing a felony.

t1_duoyb2r	0	*	Well, I think it's easier to just not dress and act like a thug, but I've stopped trying to understand gun owners in general.
t1_duog8i7	0	*	And there is no way to stop things like this
t1_duo1lz9	1	*	There are, and in order to participate in the gun show they require background checks for any vender.   Side note: just out of curiousity why quote my entire comment?

t1_duo1qt8	1	*	Same, man.  But I'm not about to go open a heroine store, personally.  though I expect it'd be pretty lucrative.
t1_duo7rip	0	*	Laws rarely directly stop anything. It's a system of deterrence, rehabilitation, punishment, harm reduction, mediation, etc. By your logic all laws are faulty because all laws are broken.
t1_dunq20k	1	*	That actually sounds like a decent compromise imo 
t1_duo76mn	0	*	he wasn't really a relative by marriage. it was a sham marriage for a green card, his wife had a real husband or boyfriend or something and he was paid a pittance for marrying her.

t1_duook0f	1	*	He's talking about the average amount per gun.
t1_dupoep4	0	*	I've heard of optional buybacks offering around a hundred, but I guess a mandatory buyback needs to offer more incentive...

t1_duohxqc	0	*	This leads to show me your free speech license, show me your right to refuse to incriminate yourself license.  But heaven forbid we ask someone to show their id for voting.
t1_dunv3tz	1	*	yeah, not exactly kosher

t1_duo3y3n	1	*	You have a right to own a gun, not a right to drive. 
t1_dup5umi	1	*	The NRA doesnt really spend that much at all on politicians when compared to other industries, 200 million combined in the last 15 years I believe
t1_duod88k	1	*	Why is it unfair? Do you think they are thinking rationally?  What evidence do you have to support this?
t1_dunvmqe	0	*	Most laws won't. That's the crux of the issue.

t1_duodm65	0	*	Anyone know how many of these mass shootings were caused by people purchasing guns through gun shows, or private sellers? Just curious actually. 
t1_duo7j6a	1	*	Fuck this is stupid logic. 
t1_duomc72	0	*	No, it doesnt surprise me. I go to the same gun shops that any gun owner would. Id say $700 is about the median cost for a pistol. Sure some are cheaper though. 
t1_duogzzk	0	*	I feel a large percentage of the armed forces would be for the people. Even if only half, losing half of the armed forces would throw the remainder into chaos. 
t1_duo3w9c	1	*	We consider the government to be both the system itself and the people charged with running it (politicians).
t1_duon6c7	0	*	>The AR-15 is popular for mass shootings because   Easier to get than handguns?
t1_duoawt7	0	*	Brazil is not a first world country. I can point to plenty of 3rd world countries too, but let's not use those as comparisons for what is supposed to be the most advanced country in the world.

t1_duozk80	1	*	That's a lot of good information. I think you're right that the amendment is broken in it's wording, and by now the legal dance has become too convoluted.
t1_dunyfp9	0	*	> Exactly why you shouldn't have a one-size fits-all blanket rule that works in one place which isn't going to work in another.  the typical government response to everything. 
t1_duq90gq	1	*	you would be surprised 
t1_duo4oqx	0	*	But there are all sorts of news reports when a shooter bought a gun at  X shop, etc.  Somebody - no, not me - needs to collect this info.
t1_duo4goy	0	*	America is a relatively young country born out of revolution. You would have a tough time convincing a lot of people to just sit back and trust the government because they know what's best.
t1_dupc1hb	0	*	I used no one to mean nearly no one.
t1_duo0q8g	1	*	Because we don't trust the poor people or brownies to vote for our candidate  That's sarcasm, by the way.

t1_duon5al	0	*	Are you saying usa has a social safety net, but shouldn't?
t1_duojt74	0	*	1. Not sure I see why that matters, in terms of whether to count this as terrorism or not.  2. How is the ROF confirming that he was part of their group not fact checking?

t1_duojjno	1	*	Many states also have laws forbidding the state government from allowing such a list.

t1_duojtoe	0	*	Aside from an outright ban, how to ensure someone be a good gun owner inside their home aside from having laws with serious consequences if they aren't?  
t1_dunxi51	1	*	I don't know. I thought they mentioned that a friend/ family may have bought them on his behalf - straw man purchase, but with these events being so frequent - it's hard to follow at times.

t1_dtjjm2h	0	*	Being impeached doesnt mean he is kicked out of office, it just means he would be committed of a crime. It would be up to the senate i believe to kick him out. And they won't want to get rid of him.

t1_dtig0o8	0	*	Don't question it or your a terrorist. The price of keeping it open is inconsequential when the price of closing it is FREEDOM^(tm)

t1_dtil42i	0	*	Oh yeah, excellent point. The wealthy Americans were totally sharing that wealth with the Cuban people and definitely not hoarding it all to themselves.
t1_dtiidti	0	*	Could you elaborate on what you mean by that?
t1_dtqquo3	0	*	...thats Not a real thing. Your opinion does not make it factual. You got some growing up to do. And I mean that most sincerely.

t1_dtiurrx	1	*	They're not enemy combatants so it makes it different. Certainly Al'Qaeda had an interest in locking up US soldiers. But the US locking up their own soldiers for doing their job is just talking silly.

t1_ds3wrze	0	*	Hey, just wondering. Is this true for recreational as well ? I'm not familiar with the situation, but I want to make sure recreational and medical are both checked the same
t1_ds2kcfb	1	*	Good luck with the quitting and the job search! 
t1_ds2m3qq	1	*	This was a rather peculiar case of being sawed in half. I was not able to reattach the bottom half to the top half...  Speak English, Doc.  We ain't scientists!
t1_ds3njmc	1	*	You are correct, I had to look a little closer to find what I needed.

t1_ds24krx	1	*	Ahhh. Haha. Derp. 
t1_ds25yp1	0	*	That doesn't have much to do with what they're talking about and I don't think you're using the right term.

t1_dtxm3lg	0	*	Well I think it's demeaning to the child to compare the impact of raping a kid to be the same as raping a corpse 
t1_dtxb4k8	0	*	Many people often forget the very basis of formation of legal aspects of things are based on human morals. The law is essential in guiding the society to behave better as a human being. 
t1_dtxdyct	1	*	Thanx. Took me a couple of re-writes to get it where I really felt it.
t1_dtxo837	0	*	The chair was never a living thing. I dont think anyone knows what happens to our consciousness when a person dies. For all we know some small part of them is still attached to their corpse. 
t1_dtxkhz0	1	*	Heh, happens to the best of us.
t1_dty1piv	0	*	No I'm talking about pedophilia.  Do you not think pedophilia severely damages a child?  
t1_dsxrw8x	1	*	Technology can absolutely prevent human error by decreasing the human element as close to 0 as possible.

t1_ds2211t	0	*	nice ableism you bigot
t1_ds1umbo	0	*	Implying current media is any form of free press.  Also implying Trump is attacking anything but the big 5 media mega corporations
t1_du6cced	0	*	What exactly wrong with killing a tsar? He was an asshole that lead Russia into useless war. And that was just one of his crimes. I mean killing him was a good thing.
t1_du6j9ki	0	*	...into your ass... Would you?
t1_du69s6q	1	*	Certainly not videos of her oligarch boyfriend talking foreign policy with a top Kremlin official. Honestly, she just doesn't seem like a very smart person, and now she really screwed herself. 
t1_du5wvgh	0	*	> Putin kills journalists to silence them. When has Trump silenced any journalists?   Irrelevant.
t1_du6fvz8	1	*	Well, Russia has apparently a GDP of over 1 trillion dollars (2016). A few million dollars would not even register, let alone be a significant portion.

t1_du5wx01	0	*	> You win nobody over by being mean.  You win nobody over by not making coherent arguments.
t1_du7csvs	0	*	Wait, how is PornHub unethical? Genuinely curious, I haven't heard about them being involved in any scandals.
t1_du5wwb5	0	*	> Criticism of the media does not equal oppression.  I didn't say it did. I said it was similar to Putin's criticism of the media in this case that we saw above, where he called it not credible.

t1_ds8lmr9	1	*	Filling an emotional need for a person is also filling a role. 
t1_ds8e3bq	0	*	That idiot's argument lost all credibility when they called dog breeds species.
t1_ds8nwk5	0	*	Lol in court for what? No contract can control what somebody does with their property after it belongs to them. Dogs are bought, not licensed out like software. 
t1_ds94pj5	0	*	Excuse me sir, animals have 1 intelligence
t1_ds8gtnu	0	*	You're a stupid person.
t1_ds8e8di	0	*	Their argument is flawed, but dogs are not people is not a valid criticism.
t1_ds8beyj	0	*	nope, if it were my choice we'd have never come down this road- but here we are, pug-laden, and obligated to the species. 
t1_ds8j4if	0	*	Why not get a hoodie with stripe down the back? Same concept less murder?
t1_ds8gkfr	1	*	No, not really. Inbreeding is a necessity when you want fast and cheap results, not good results. Of course, fast and cheap at the expense of animal suffering wins more often than not.
t1_ds8sulw	1	*	He's making fun of BECAUSE IT LOOKS SO CUTE being the average person's excuse for getting an inbred monstrosity.
t1_ds8xu9j	1	*	Beautiful girl! I love the Czech and DDR lines. 
t1_ds96i5k	1	*	Sounds like really shitty luck to me. I live in the Northeast and ratio isnt nearly as high as you suggest. Dog people in general are almost always weird, but weird doesnt inherently equal bad.
t1_dsga0vz	0	*	So it would be most genetically beneficial to marry and reproduce outside of your race, right?
t1_ds8m1om	0	*	All show breeders have that . In fact I had to sign saying I wouldnt even let him outside 
t1_ds8b9wl	0	*	i'm pointing out that if you cant make the same argument for people, you shouldn't be making it for animals we keep explicitly as companions. 
t1_ds8qw12	0	*	Glad you had to point that out, sounds like you were the one here that said something to hear yourself talk in the end. 
t1_ds8pnpv	0	*	*slowly closes gofundme page.

t1_ds8o3z6	0	*	Yep - working line GSDs are still bred for function. [My boy](https://imgur.com/a/O8aJP) looks more like the originals as well. 
t1_ds8hnug	1	*	> These dogs exist and do you think we should just pass some global or federal resolution to sterilize them all so we can't produce anymore?  That's a start, yes.
t1_ds8nnk7	1	*	Moon Moon?
t1_dver9a8	0	*	Neural crest cells, fascinating. Thanks for sharing!
t1_dsdm7ir	1	*	You are right about that i think.  I just dont like to rule the breed out entirely like the sounding-board of reddit has decided. They are an abomination, totally, but they can be saved.
t1_ds8ms64	0	*	See this hat, twas my cat.   Evening wear vampire bat!
t1_ds8vxda	1	*	I'm saying that. STEM scum are incredibly arrogant. They think they know everything and BAM they cause a mass extinction.
t1_ds8jjaa	0	*	if concentration is the crucial factor for survival, most of us on Reddit would be dead
t1_ds9syf2	1	*	Too late to give us ideas, I think.
t1_ds9d3tp	0	*	I mean, they're taking good care of lots of animals. You want to take their animals away because they're stingy about who they adopt to?
t1_ds8fmky	0	*	When a kid jumps over your fence to get a ball a dog won't be able to differentiate. 
t1_ds8kmb5	0	*	Really, so the fault is on me for my response to God you're stupid being s bit hostile? Haha wow
t1_ds8sfiq	1	*	I think most pitts are great but the fact is their physicality is undeniably greater than most other breeds. So even if 95% are great pets I don't want to risk it. 
t1_ds8nvzx	0	*	Or... if you're going to buy a dog, get one that fits your lifestyle.   Also your analogy is retarded. 
t1_ds8gl93	1	*	Such condescension.  /s

t1_ds8tvs2	0	*	Thats not what I asked...

t1_ds8mfep	0	*	So again. Which breeds do we keep and cross breed? 
t1_ds8hytk	0	*	Re-read your last sentence and tell me who's being condescending, you or him.
t1_ds8nr5n	1	*	My domestic short hair (code for cat mutt lol) Raven used to pant after playing a little too hard. Cat panting is weird because it looks like dog panting and is unexpected.
t1_ds8h6cn	0	*	but that doesnt answer my question.   Should we stop people who have genetic issues that can be passed on from having offspring? 
t1_ds8vpwz	0	*	Cool, I'm going to downvote any post of yours I see here on out. 
t1_ds8mr8o	0	*	Your parents obviously didnt pay your therapist enough with that small dick complex you have going on over there.

t1_ds8mj6d	1	*	What are you talking about?
t1_ds8kd6i	1	*	Eeesh.
t1_ds8fd90	1	*	I mean most breeds arent freakish? I dont know what youre talking about man, my own breed is the australian cattle dog, a super healthy robust breed anyway. My dog is a mutt anyway
t1_ds8hlt1	0	*	Why would you hop straight to sterilising them rather than just not deliberately breeding them with each other and perpetuating the pure breed? Weird 
t1_ds8obth	0	*	Yup! As long as a munchkin is bred with a non munchkin, the cats that are produced tend to be very healthy, active little cats. Problems arise when you breed a munchkin to a munchkin. 
t1_ds8k057	1	*	Umm, excuse you. The South is a big place, my dude, and I assure you that we aren't all training our dogs to fight for the PRC.
t1_ds8hs2t	1	*	Aren't we already sterilising most dogs? And if you just let them breed freely I don't think pure bulldogs would exist two generations from now. Nature wouldn't produce bulldogs.
t1_ds8hcp9	1	*	I went to a dog show once. Craziest motherfuckers I've met in my life. That movie was more documentary than mockumentary, it turns out.
t1_dsa1l0q	0	*	[Heres a bunch of NZ kits (mixed colors](https://imgur.com/a/8CmeY). I do breed them but they arent show or pets, just me trying to feed more humane meat to the family and dogs.

t1_ds8ktca	0	*	Do you have a source for this? I can't find anything about hybrid dogs' offspring having more health issues. 
t1_ds94c1y	1	*	Sterilization is a straw-man argument /u/BBQ_HaX0r invented so if you have an issue with it then take it up with them.

t1_dtuqs0p	0	*	Because I wanted to point out and disambiguate the idea that the government pays people. People pay the government to provide services, it's never a charity, as some people fail to grasp.

t1_dtj3wy3	0	*	Being a man does not make you an MMA fighter, but you certainly have a much better chance of fighting off your attacker than a woman.  That is what makes women more vulnerable, on the whole.  
t1_dtj0txj	0	*	That's kind of fucked up. I can see why youd prioritize families over single people... but not women over men.. or single mothers over single fathers.
t1_dtiwbzp	0	*	Most people could do it. Less are willing to, less still to do it thoroughly and properly
t1_dtj3z8a	0	*	I'd much rather sleep outside. Forced belief/ conversion for a warm bed is not charity. Charity isn't suppose to cost anything. 
t1_dtj0da4	0	*	Scientology doesn't help people. It enslaves them.
t1_dtj7bkh	1	*	Mental health care is also needed. We need a multifaceted, results-based approach. Housing gives better, if imperfect, results.
t1_dtizs8w	0	*	I think that making homeless shelters safer would be money better spent. Personally, I think that lockable sleeping berths (like pod hotels) would be a cost-effective solution.

t1_dtjbv3n	0	*	Sponsor them at a local shelter and help them get back on their feet, if theyre mentally ill then refer them to the local police/shelter.. lots of ways dude. The homeless are still people.

t1_dtqugs1	1	*	Yes.  Allow them.  We allow it to happen.  Out of a misplaced sense of benevolence.
t1_dtj9wdh	1	*	Macro v micro. I'd expect my taxes to sort out the cause of the problem and my earnings post-tax to pay for the correction of the problem. So me pay for camera and council pay for rehab.

t1_dtivx8g	1	*	A bum pit is the correct answer.
t1_dtjn5ko	1	*	Except I'm a registered Democrat from a working family. But nice try in demonizing anyone right of center. You all are so angry at opposing views, I just don't get why you won't be civil?
t1_dtn0oqz	0	*	That's good, I'm happy for you.  I've had other women tell me otherwise.
t1_dtj3l8u	0	*	Guess the problem just wont ever get solved then xaf\\_()_/xaf

t1_dtj3u8j	1	*	No you.
t1_dtiwma0	0	*	No, the problem is that someone somewhere thought that *adding* metal bars to benches that previously had none was a good solution to the problems you just described.
t1_dtjgb2x	1	*	Thank you for clarifying what I was saying. I appreciate it.
t1_dtj4w2g	1	*	Thats a fair complaint. Theres no real argument against allowing investors to invest in housing, but gentrification is definitely a negative externality. 
t1_dtjqhq9	0	*	What else do you do with the severely mentally ill and disabled that don't seek other help? Let them die on the street?
t1_dtjy8wb	0	*	Right, but they have not lost the ability to sit on them like everyone else. 
t1_dtiys15	0	*	I didn't do that in any way. I just don't think I'm better than anyone else and have empathy for those who were unlucky enough to be in those situations. 
t1_dtins7m	1	*	In some cases it only takes one hit but most often it takes several consecutive uses to become dependent.  No one thinks they're going to get addicted though.
t1_dtiy2ga	0	*	But this bench is in the UK which has socialised medicine for everyone that is completely free for the homeless.
t1_dtik36r	0	*	Where did you get the notion that the word 'bum' has anything to do with sexuality? I always thought that word described a certain kind of homeless people.
t1_dtj3owc	0	*	Every person who speeds ends up killing someone? Thats now how the law works buddy
t1_dtiv60s	0	*	Was she an alcoholic or a drug addict?  Did she want to get clean and did?  Did she have mental health issues?
t1_dtj13e9	1	*	Or your life doesn't take you through the neighbourhoods where its a problem.  Often in the western world you can be half a mile from absolute poverty and completely blind to it. 
t1_dtiwe75	1	*	True. Not being able to look at porn would be a deal breaker. 
t1_dtiwyxc	1	*	Ouch.
t1_dtj9grx	0	*	Eh I pay my taxes for the clever people to use my money for the good of society. 
t1_dtj34nk	0	*	Why don't you open up your home and give resource to them, instead? One less middlemen.
t1_du7w311	0	*	Can you tell me what you mean by As a Flemings is that a place or religion? 
t1_du87027	1	*	Yup preety much!

t1_du7sbi8	1	*	Thank you very much. I will read up.
t1_duacg6w	1	*	Argentina, so it's like, just up.
t1_du7ylju	1	*	Yes    Also, it's an acronym for BIhar, MAdhya pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar pradesh.    The states that make this group.
t1_du82hia	1	*	1. I go to Michigan State. Same MSU?  2. Yeah I doubt the Indian redditors are going to have to a lot of experience working in poor rural areas if I had to guess. 
t1_dthfr69	0	*	Ok. So if I were to shower, can I go to a random playground and stand in front of everyone showing my firm, thick, hard, 9 inch penis? 
t1_dthr04d	1	*	>headline  That's all you read huh?
t1_dth9bq6	0	*	Funny a TD poster wants to make up fake news to fit an agenda.  Almost like how your president tweeted fake videos out.  SAD.
t1_dssj3kf	0	*	And? We know ETH did well. It's not doing well today. It crashed along with the rest of the market. It's not independent from bitcoin.
t1_dssx74i	1	*	New Zealand is having a housing crisis because of this
t1_dstd4fh	1	*	Sorry what? Can you explain? 
t1_dss60g5	0	*	Well then thats stupid. Shouldnt they be incentivizing marriage as opposed to being better of single or getting divorced? 
t1_dss9axw	0	*	Hmmm they taken over da world it seems
t1_dss0wte	0	*	Do you want the money invested in the West to make western countries better or do you want the money to stay in china to make china better, pick one. 
t1_dst3yia	1	*	I wouldn't want one from a pro-gamer either without it being well under MSRP for the same reason.
t1_dsrwpc9	1	*	I just wish I had pulled the trigger on a new video card a year ago.  Technology is supposed to become cheaper over time, not double in price...
t1_dstaugo	1	*	And buying our politicians :/
t1_dst31mv	1	*	No problem. Just remember to backup your wallet and that if you don't hold your own keys you hold nothing. Any website can go poof.
t1_dssk29p	1	*	Yeah, I get it. I was seriously tempted to not cancel the order on the other two cards since I'm pretty sure I could get a few hundred bucks more for them on ebay. Good luck in the hunt.
t1_dtah3d5	0	*	He doesn't seem scared to me.  A scared man doesn't arrest the most powerful people in the country and hold them ransome for every penny of their wealth.  He feels secure.  And why wouldn't he?
t1_dt9ztng	0	*	I love double posts, I can downvote twice.
t1_dto4k0p	0	*	Well, you went on that limb. I didn't make you look stupid, you did that all by yourself. 
t1_dto4yjh	0	*	Where is all this constant proof you speak of?
t1_dto3y29	0	*	So your candidate did lose then. Good to know. That whole LOL I didn't vote for Hillary champ was some pedantic gotcha moment your liberal brain came up with.
t1_dtnybhd	0	*	> They won't give a fuck either unless **WHEN** they get crushed in 2018.  FTFY
t1_dto0p3h	0	*	Yeah? Then why wasn't he charged in 2013? Why wasn't he charged now? 
t1_dtp97x8	0	*	I mean you're the one that thinks it's factually correct to say Gowdy is saying the memo is bs. cogdis
t1_dtodpjh	0	*	So two different people say there is something wrong with the memo and you try to read that as downgraded? Watch any Gowdy interview from the past week or how about try reading the memo.
t1_dtnwt58	0	*	Can you stop trying to sell partisan fucking hackery for a single second? 
t1_dtnvdk5	0	*	Republicans never once brought articles of impeachment against Obama.  I can't tell if he's being serious or just trolling. I'm guessing this is all part of that hypernormalization thing. 
t1_dtnveni	1	*	Interesting how you equivocate between information and facts.
t1_dto48jl	0	*	> I want to do everything I can to make sure Trump and his accomplices in Congress get everything that's coming to them.  4 more years?
t1_dto4vqr	1	*	It shows that author/s wrote it with dishonest intent and are prepared to lie so it can't show anything else without confirmation from an actually credible source.
t1_dto76te	1	*	You need a proper filter on that mind of yours.
t1_dto3zo3	0	*	which would make the warrant void and the result of the surveillance illegal.   Plus Nunes is lying. The warrant was obtained thru proper process. 
t1_dtntrqy	0	*	For one thing, the RNC also funded the Steele dossier. Before the RNC did. They pulled out after Trump got the nomination.   Another thing, the investigation began before that report.
t1_dtognbk	1	*	And incumbency.
t1_dtospzo	0	*	The Dutch literally have video evidence of it. It wasnt based on a lie, you're the one being lied to.
t1_dtovnqg	0	*	I bet you enjoyed visualizing that while you dreamed it up. 
t1_dtnzvdi	0	*	On your cardigan?
t1_dtnz6f5	0	*	...and Im guessing you dont see the glaring hypocrisy? I can spell it out for you, but Id have to use big words that use two or three syllables - might go over your head.
t1_dto4qui	1	*	Who hurt you dude? 
t1_dtosdob	1	*	I was making a low effort joke. I should have added  /s 
t1_dt1h30s	1	*	I disregard that notion having any basis in reality. They two sides could not be more different.   And no, they were not joking in the slightest. They really believe that tripe.
t1_dur6t8n	1	*	I mean, loved the cat when it was with me. I'm just bitter!
t1_duqyvqd	0	*	Yup, you sound like a terrorist 
t1_dtfq9eh	0	*	It's nice that you believe that lol
t1_du6ui1b	0	*	Socialism never took root in America because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires.   - John Steinbeck.
t1_du6kxjv	0	*	He wasn't saying down with capitalism, he was just saying jesus christ America, go easy on your poor people, it's hard
t1_du6h51o	1	*	So now your issue is that internet discussion isn't real action?  Grow the fuck up.
t1_du6iumz	1	*	Thank you!

t1_du6k2ks	0	*	no thanks, looks like trash
t1_du6m53c	0	*	Finding about all these subs make me feel like I'm vastly inadequate at using reddit. How do people even stumble upon these random subs?
t1_du6rd2y	0	*	http://lmgtfy.com/?q=Israel+Kills+Kids+and+Teenagers  Make sure to read more than one of the articles from different sites.
t1_du6h7re	1	*	You wrote this one first? Angry panda.
t1_du6qve0	1	*	Thats just an equal part of Israel and better off than it would be in Syria
t1_du6huux	0	*	Watch your mouth and sarcasm. Don't do that again.
t1_du8mw9o	0	*	Trump or not, he's the president. What can WE do to make sure he does what's in the best interest for humanity?
t1_du76m9h	0	*	Yeah. and black people in britain are african americans, too
t1_du91cp9	1	*	Carlin would hate this shit show so much
t1_du6k2ah	0	*	Yes I do. If you don't, then go find something you actually do care about.
t1_du6nq5t	1	*	And that tells you everything you need to know about the intelligence of everyone involved. 
t1_du6wkma	1	*	Would make sense if it was; I believe that quote was from a Soviet propaganda pamphlet in the book.
t1_du77wdk	0	*	I would say they're a little more civilized than Palestine. Palestine pretty much promotes religious and political genocide.
t1_du91bss	1	*	Carlin would hate this shit show so much
t1_du6k1oa	1	*	Clearly he is too intelligent for the rest of us mere mortals. 
t1_du6qfm6	0	*	Are the soldiers now who only fights because they were promised education heroes too? 
t1_du6st7k	0	*	Except no, rock throwers get shot during clashes, situations when their rocks can actually hurt people (and rock throwing has killed).
t1_du6zazn	1	*	There's just something about his style. He writes in almost a childish, playful tone, and it just makes the darker parts even sadder. He's great at showing off the human experience. 
t1_du6th3n	1	*	Which part? 
t1_du6owqx	0	*	That sub might as well be /r/fulloncommunism
t1_du6xeaa	1	*	Nope just think they should be brought to task for their numerous human rights offenses.
t1_du93l6i	1	*	https://pitchfork.com/news/lawmaker-calls-for-lorde-florida-concert-cancellations-over-israel/
t1_du6j2dh	0	*	You convinced me... Ill give it a go! 
t1_du6uph4	0	*	Doesn't mean I can't help out. I can advocate for different senators to be elected around the country.
t1_du6wztp	0	*	Slaughterhouse 5 was published in 1969
t1_du6w6yr	1	*	Totally agree because I have Isreali friends and Jewish friends who actually condemn the actions of the settlers. They say the same thing.
t1_du6m5be	0	*	My guess is that thanks to how much the current US administration uses whataboutism as a tactic to derail discourse, we've become better at detecting it.
t1_du73iig	0	*	Vonnegut himself would fit right in there. He was a socialist and loved Eugene Debs. 
t1_du6h5qm	1	*	I'm really hoping you're not a dad. I see 37 so that's a bad sign but then I remember Pandas aren't too good at that.
t1_du6ico2	0	*	I didn't even had to scroll that far down to find someone literally defending the murder of Palestinian teenage boys. We're reaching levels of bootlicking that shouldn't be possible!
t1_du6sso7	1	*	As good as ordered. Thank you!
t1_du6s2ud	0	*	Right, but that's *Gaza* the PLO is the resident governing body of the West Bank and majority of Palestinians. The PLO is who is trying to negotiate with Isreal for a *fair* two state solution
t1_du70qcs	1	*	Prove  my words?  http://articles.latimes.com/1987-01-12/news/mn-3102_1_irish-soldier
t1_du7twym	1	*	If it was more of a discussion place and less of a meme factory, that probably *would* be the sidebar.
t1_du6uku1	1	*	You do realize every Israeli citizen is x-military right? Thats kind of a broad category for a nation with mandatory inscription 
t1_du6m1t3	1	*	Way to support your argument with details and facts, really impressive.  You have no idea how much I know or don't know.  What part of what I said isn't factually accurate?
t1_dstf504	0	*	Oh look, there it is again. 
t1_dsuz0my	1	*	I think it's funny that you are comparing it to birthers when Trump is the one who actually started all that birther crap. 
t1_ds1ikca	0	*	Err, he's Scottish mate.
t1_ds1tg4o	0	*	Why would someone support the reduction of their own right? As a guy from the UK, the kind of free speech Americans have is one of the things I admire about the US.
t1_ds31h8v	1	*	I'm not arguing against your claim
t1_ds1tmxm	0	*	I know most of the users in the internet don't use Hitler as historical figure, but if we start to censor Hitler or any other hated historical figure, where will it end?
t1_ds1zyse	1	*	Sorry mate you're the one who's been brainwashed.
t1_ds249wr	0	*	What can't I say? Just let me know and I can promise I'll prove you wrong.
t1_ds2mg32	1	*	Yeah, because it's well known that Russians have among the highest gdp per capita in the world, especially as you leave Moscow and St. Petersburg areas.
t1_ds1tohd	1	*	Yes. It is bad.
t1_ds1s2rn	0	*	Well Nazis think it shouldn't be controversial and should be a regular part of life. What on earth do you think?
t1_ds1hr0s	1	*	Man those tiki torches were a bad choice for those guys.  Not as bad of a choice as say idolizing Hitler but a bad one. 
t1_ds1xzzo	1	*	who decides that pro-hitler content can be censored.  and when will they decide the next hitler needs censoring.  
t1_duecusq	0	*	Nice! That's the CBO!  OECD has the US at 18.6%,  GAO has the US at 12.7%   CTJ has the US at 19.4%,    Gabriel Zucman has US at 12.5%.  
t1_duel1o2	0	*	Right along with a budget surplus.
t1_duehlql	0	*	Its 1% approximately 50 billion a year. 
t1_duea79e	0	*	So read none of the previous comments or the article also? Cool cool.
t1_dueep0e	0	*	I'm confusing my presidential timelines, but if we want to pin something from the Clinton era it'll be relaxation of rules on derivatives trading
t1_duggdp0	0	*	16% of the budget over ten years wouldn't equal 1.5 to 2 trillion? We have a budget over 4 trillion.  If we cut military from 16 % to 6% that would be 400 million x 10 = 4 trillion.   
t1_duelq6m	0	*	Lol I clicked my own link and it looks like cancer, but still readable. Under his administration it went from roughly 6tn to 10tn so not even double.
t1_duehnj9	0	*	Yes Obama should've just let the economy to die. Can you think before you post?
t1_dup1czu	0	*	No, it's just a poor time to bring it up given the context, and comes across as an attempt to divert the focus of the issue.
t1_dunq0uf	1	*	Canada has the same protections. As does Europe. And given the population on Reddit, it's safe to assume he is from one of these places.
t1_dunnl4g	1	*	All of this makes me want to watch Stand By Me. 
t1_dunf0rw	0	*	They could stop doing this shit. What are you gonna Do about it? 
t1_duo9asz	0	*	Certificate : 0/1600 Fail  There enough proof?
t1_duop1qd	1	*	To decline a polite request would require a reason wouldn't it? So you are expecting someone to take their free time and dedicate it to your benefit, using social contract as a false premise.
t1_dup4i9y	0	*	So it's ok to discriminate me based on my opinion, even if it's unpopular and I'm in the minority? Why your opinion is OK and mine is shit? How about some tolerance which you praise? 
t1_duo9yl9	1	*	Oh OK, thanks.
t1_dtx56vp	0	*	Not at all. Some words convey tone just the same as actual tone.  Calling someone dumb is nothing but you being mad at them lol
t1_ds1f9ng	0	*	Every politician on every side likes money. This isnt a one party thing. 
t1_ds1g29o	0	*	Crush me like one of your American towers.

t1_ds30ga8	0	*	Numerous women have claimed this. Oh and he admitted on tape that he sexually assaults people.
t1_ds1wjli	1	*	You don't need to control the country, you just need to keep it fucked up enough that others can't come in and control it
t1_ds1g8ul	1	*	We didnt leave and ISIS still took control of huge portions.  Middle East is just a cluster fuck no matter what.  
t1_ds1k5l8	0	*	I think Pakistan's only position was to play stupid and be, Holy shit he was hiding right there, good thing you got him.
t1_ds1hcx8	0	*	In this metaphor, I think Obama was more like the chairman of the theater then the conductor.
t1_ds1kg3n	0	*	Im pretty sure the two atomic bombs that killed 100,000+ were bigger.....murderfests?
t1_ds1fmzr	0	*	People have been saying he won't do a lot of things, like get the nomination, win, achieve 3% GDP, pass a tax plan, etc. 
t1_ds1p8i4	1	*	He is already changing policy. Let's see if he continues in a good way.
t1_ds1gemx	0	*	it's good enough if it always works today
t1_ds1ql62	1	*	What's the exchange rate between dollar signs and money? 
t1_ds1eim8	0	*	You think India doesnt have nukes and a desire to hold Kashmir? Where are you from?
t1_ds1is3d	0	*	With how many civilians are killed in our ramped up air strike program, the next ISIS is brewing there now. Its the exact set of factors that lead to their creation 
t1_ds1f1fk	0	*	> Afghanistan was a lot more peaceful, compared to the shit hole it is now after the American invasion.  By what metric are you making that claim?  Afghanistan has been in a civil war since 1978.
t1_ds1egkv	0	*	Everybody wins
t1_ds1jhmh	0	*	Post-nazi Germany. We rebuilt their infrastructure before leaving. Definitely a success story compared to, say, Iraq or Libya. 
t1_ds1nn0g	0	*	Not our region not our problem. 
t1_ds1fuvr	0	*	like the operations until now were done to stop the terrorists lol
t1_ds1ezyg	0	*	I hear Vietnam was going to lose all of its land too.
t1_ds1emqs	0	*	Counterpoint: Iraq and the rise of ISIS
t1_ds1eslv	1	*	No, we're still propping up the mediocre government and preventing a power vacuum. 
t1_ds1gajv	0	*	That's what the US has been doing. We want Afghanistan to sort their shit out themselves, the US military is just there to ensure they do it peacefully. 
t1_ds1qb6n	0	*	Death is part of war, you don't avoid war just because people will die 
t1_ds1rkj3	1	*	Well dogmatic process is the caste system and human subjectivity is how they view it? 
t1_ds1re0g	1	*	A fullscale war with a land invasion with tanks etc? Sure
t1_ds1ffcx	0	*	Yes, and we can clearly see that that method of warfare has worked tremendously well these past few decades 
t1_ds1hwua	0	*	Lol wat? Of course the executive branch had to follow through on it but that doesn't mean they did any of the work
t1_ds1i1zq	0	*	What episode was that?
t1_ds1fiao	1	*	Pence would believe that, though. 
t1_ds1tjx2	1	*	I'm more concerned with the death toll than the money.
t1_ds1jf45	0	*	This is a direct result of his overt toxicity. He attacks American citizens that he doesn't like on the regular.
t1_ds1gyfx	0	*	Literally every one of the 45 presidents would've made the same call. Its stupid to celebrate obama for it. He did many other good things
t1_ds1jkfd	0	*	Do you think we airlift all our shit to Afghanistan?  Most troops, vehicles, and supplies are sent to Pakistan and then sent over the border. It's much safer and much cheaper.
t1_ds1ea7a	0	*	Not so much Indian rights. 
t1_ds1f8wj	1	*	It's a nuclear state with strong ties to terrorists. Like the person above said, rather have one foot in the door. 
t1_ds1f3n3	0	*	Yeah, don't spoil the movie they'll make about it in 20 years for me.
t1_ds1fbmm	0	*	Ask ISIS
t1_ds1q9eb	0	*	We should ask them how that worked out for them, oh wait we cant they ded U0001f643
t1_ds1ghp7	0	*	They didn't decline per se, but American troops were to no longer be granted immunity, and any crimes would be punishable by Iraqi law. So we got the fuck out.
t1_ds1komv	0	*	You do understand the actual 'war' part of the Iraq wars were more or less a steamroll by American troops, right? Losses were due to the occupation, not the war. 
t1_ds1hcvm	0	*	And the resulting GLOBAL nuclear winter kills all of us.
t1_ds1fjoa	0	*	Worlds largest democracy AND rivals with China too.

t1_ds2dzy2	0	*	Ahh yes, I forgot Orgs tasked with monitoring human rights situations can't compare to anecdotal evidence. 
t1_ds1g8fr	1	*	They're almost entirely legitimately lost, most of THEM at sea. It's easy to see how one more can get lost and nobody thinks anything of it until it detonates in New York.
t1_ds1i1eg	0	*	And *you're* not good at English, but I love you anyway.
t1_ds1ir2n	0	*	Don't think peace has ever been a goal for US.

t1_ds1gclv	0	*	Americas #1 terrorist enemy was Osama.  He did kill thousands of Americans 
t1_dsl6vtb	0	*	https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1965  I think this one. 
t1_ds1vsiv	0	*	Debatable but Indian financing for terrorist groups attacking Pakistan is not exactly helping things. 
t1_ds1f0i4	0	*	If the US level Pakistan, China and Russia empty their arsenals.  So the US wouldnt level Pakistan.
t1_ds1kvzt	1	*	then you become the buffer between SA and Iran.  have fun fighting a proxy war when you're the proxy, poetic justice that lol
t1_ds1fdzo	1	*	No, they were strongest when they controlled half the country 3 years ago. They dont hold any territory in Iraq anymore
t1_ds1vm49	0	*	Because making fun of someones race is pretty racist my dude whereas taking the piss out of a horrible fake tan is not. 
t1_ds1snlw	1	*	So whats your excuse for Obama not doing anything then?
t1_ds1jim0	0	*	There's nearly as many broken promises as ones made, though. And most of them have been stalled and will likely never come into fruition.
t1_ds1duxc	0	*	ISIS are terrorists the trail of death of innocents and destruction makes them terrorists. The mujahadeen were fighting to free Afghanistan from soviets
t1_ds21l70	1	*	[Not unless they can afford to buy ladders, of course.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYZKrn7Bbl8)
t1_ds1ef9o	0	*	Yup. The entire goal there should be avoiding the possibility of a nuclear exchange that could kill literally billions of humans. CheetoBenito spouting off at Islamabad is in no way constructive.
t1_ds1fxx6	0	*	Which are made from opium
t1_ds1mj6g	1	*	Sure, but I'm fairly sure it hasn't been Afghanistan invading others, but being invaded and that can hardly be conducive to passing muster as a civilised nation as others are saying it isn't.
t1_ds1f9s4	1	*	At the same time, women in some parts are also reporting they're lives have gotten better because of our intervention that as long as we're keeping the Taliban at bay.
t1_ds1kth9	0	*	Yeah ok - Pakistan was going to declare war on the United States. I'm quaking in my boots. 
t1_ds1gmfp	0	*	The Iraqi government wouldn't extend the status of forces agreement which gave American soldiers immunity in Iraqi courts.

t1_ds1ez04	1	*	Please don't give anyone ideas. 
t1_ds1ftcg	0	*	I really don't think that person is Trump though. He doesn't seem to have helped political Quagmire's, but rather created many more.

t1_ds1g0d8	0	*	That's why people who support him think you're an idiot
t1_ds1i7kc	1	*	Because the ME is a chessgame, if we let Russia gain control, they gain power and allies. Say they turned Germany against France.

t1_ds1ibr9	1	*	The last time we made an ally out of an enemy, we did this to Japan.  You may be on to something.
t1_ds1i065	0	*	He will if he completes all the necessary projects *under* budget.
t1_ds1mbgn	0	*	Do you understand that he's lost $600 million this year? He is clearly not in it for the money
t1_ds1k62o	1	*	We all wish for that. 
t1_ds1j433	1	*	So do you believe if we stay another group won't come about?  Do you think if we never left ISIS would have never began? 
t1_ds1gdyr	1	*	Lol I didn't say that. You must know that right? Like there is more than that way to attack people
t1_ds1f5zf	0	*	Agreed. There's a reason why North Korea hasn't launched a nuclear attack despite threatening to a few thousand times. They know they will be obliterated if they do. And Pakistan is no different.
t1_ds1hrqv	0	*	I will aware of hindu zealots.  We are talking about Pakistan. Don't try to change the subject or deflect blame by trying to say but (insert another religion here) are just as bad!).  
t1_ds1hpis	0	*	What?? That's a terrible fucking idea. You want us to create a power vacuum, then just dance away and let Whoever fills it fill it, in a part of the world that manufactures violent terrorists?
t1_ds1lvt1	1	*	Lmao, thats what JFK thought too 
t1_ds1ebzy	1	*	They are fucking crazy, though.
t1_ds1g2my	1	*	Edit - forgot cant link in this sub.  Just google sykes Picot. The west has had an interest in the area long before ISIS and the us russian conflict. 
t1_ds1g2h3	1	*	Like when he said everyone will be covered for cheaper? Maybe because of that old saying fool me once...
t1_ds63ryr	1	*	Ain't that the truth.
t1_ds1j8gw	1	*	They get a lower percentage tax cut, but since they pay almost all the taxes, yes the dollar figure will be higher.

t1_ds1onse	0	*	> He's a craven.  I bet you learn your geopolitics from videogames and internet forums, don't you?
t1_ds1gxdl	1	*	Can we just press the reset button on the middle east, we have enough nukes for that.
t1_ds3jxrv	1	*	Oh, so I'm a nutjob for demanding someone with executive experience in the executive branch? Someone who's good at working within constraints?
t1_ds1icc9	1	*	Yep, pretty much this.
t1_ds1ezsj	1	*	Yep, Afghanistan is a major nexus in Eurasia. The key change here is China.
t1_ds1fhw4	1	*	Pick one.... So many are like this. However right now I was referring to Pakistan. 
t1_ds1ghvd	1	*	Yahoodi = Jewish  Saazish = Conspiracy
t1_ds1fqcv	0	*	So it's extortion money?
t1_ds1jeam	0	*	A little Googling and Wikipediaing.   
t1_ds1em7u	0	*	~~By stick I mean cutting off aid, not nuking a goddamned city.~~  Edit: So you are saying stopping aid will make a terrorist nuke a US city? That sounds ridiculous.

t1_ds1nfuq	0	*	You: He basically folded on everything  Me: Example of what he didn't fold on  You:You're stupid.
t1_ds1ouqc	1	*	Elaborate please?
t1_ds1jayw	1	*	His name is *JAAAAMES CAMERON*, the bravest pioneer!
t1_ds2vahp	1	*	You make a great point... but would you want to be unfairly lumped in with his supporters just because the law of averages did its thing and the orange turd said something correct for a change?
t1_ds1k3ej	1	*	the difference is people actually want to fight. not personally fighting, but still getting that righteous rush of saying that they are
t1_ds1fm5x	0	*	Not a problem, Fox can just blame their rise on the Democrats.
t1_ds1jghd	0	*	Kakarot faps, but what about Piccolo?
t1_ds5dqk6	0	*	Is this a joke? Yeah fuck seal 6, Took em TEN years to do that!!! Default credit goes to obama.  The fuck are you even saying? 
t1_ds1gagr	1	*	That sounds stupid. An intact Mumbai is more important to India than nuking all those cities in retaliation. Also there's no reason to believe India will the US line.   
t1_ds1g28w	1	*	Rein = device used to alter the direction or speed of a horse   Reign = as in the reign of King Edward or any other monarch 
t1_ds1p35c	1	*	Alright Bernie calm down
t1_ds1mxhl	0	*	So those 500 arrests are just for show, and it's a big conspiracy to convince us that Saudi Arabia is done with terrorism?  Ooook
t1_ds1vhgg	0	*	Point out where I mentioned anything about society as a whole, and I'll take that last comment seriously.
t1_ds1mva8	1	*	On a planet with only water and horses?
t1_ds1hi2i	0	*	> Completely abandoning the international stage is not beneficial to American interest.  Cutting off aid to Pakistan != totally abandoning the international stage.  
t1_ds1xshz	1	*	Did Obama do anything wrong that wasn't Bush's fault?  And will Trump do anything right that isn't Obama's doing?
t1_ds1w60l	1	*	Who are you talking about? Give a name because I have not read any accusations like that.
t1_ds1n3zj	1	*	I don't want to set the world on fiiiiiire
t1_ds1kk4g	0	*	> he is seeking to undermine them.  It's only fair. They, at least a certain leadership element, sought to undermine him. The newly released text messages demonstrated that.
t1_ds21ayq	1	*	I do that too, just go the kingdom without a king route, no need for silly Habsburgs in my Austria-Hungary!
t1_ds1n0s5	1	*	*rein
t1_ds1fkkh	0	*	Thats the point, vacuum is no bueno
t1_ds1gn8e	1	*	That's not a a bad idea except for the fact we never stick around to help rebuild like we did with Japan, so the country stays unstable and resentful of the US.
t1_ds1f5m2	1	*	It is surprising that he obviously blackmailed Floridaman Schultz, got arrested, oversaw the DNC leaks, yet his and his family never make it to the evening news. I wonder why?
t1_ds1hemp	1	*	Holy Shit. I am stealing this. 
t1_ds1gkky	1	*	So burn Pakistan (a relatively stable country) as well? 
t1_ds1kfmy	1	*	The Pashtun area of Afghanistan needs to be part of Pakistan. The Durand line put a border right down the middle of an ethic group that has been there for thousands of years.
t1_ds1gli8	0	*	Yes, I have. The DoD is the largest employer.  The Chinese army is #2.
t1_ds1g3z5	0	*	And then pakistan will go 100% to china. 
t1_ds1y2f1	1	*	This issue didn't start with bush.
t1_ds1hkv5	1	*	Er US can't invade Pakistan because Pakistan actually built ties with countries which will respond. Countries like China.
t1_ds1oz4q	0	*	Well they wouldn't be strong arming us for money. And we could shut down their nuclear program. That'd be a good start. 
t1_ds1lqoc	0	*	Killing Osama bin Laden was wrong. Right. Its not like he was living in San Diego.
t1_ds2unqb	1	*	Exactly. Then Pakistan and their good terrorists can finally live in peace.
t1_ds1n5nk	1	*	[Previously, on wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IndiaPakistan_relations)

t1_ds1ec2l	1	*	Well they wouldn't all did.
t1_ds1ugoi	0	*	So because somebody slipped us something we have to forgive Pakistan for screwing us?   Hmmm. No thanks.
t1_ds1emqd	1	*	Even better then, 72 virgins for everyone...
t1_ds1gaez	0	*	You think Bush wouldn't have loved to have killed bin Laden? Talk about Mission Accomplished he would have put a billboard on the White House lawn.

t1_ds1vol4	0	*	Prove it or shut up. 
t1_ds20rt3	1	*	Nah, not against a country that has a proper armed force and a China at its back. Also, nukes.  Life is not a comic-book, and war is not a page out of Supermans playbook.
t1_ds1gqkq	1	*	Not much. Thats why its so strange he said largest. 
t1_ds1fv6g	0	*	Sounds great.  And then ISIS.
t1_ds1s8n7	1	*	Thank you. I found both links interesting.
t1_ds1ny0j	1	*	Eh... more like yell really loudly and wave around a homemade pipe bomb, but I agree with what you were getting at.

t1_ds1nkr0	1	*	Where did you hear that Pakistan has oil? Nobodys touching those rare earth metals while there's an ongoing insurgency in Afghanistan. Afghanistan needs a political settlement. Period.
t1_ds1tg2h	0	*	Obama had followed Trump around Asia talking to leaders after Trump left the country. You're right that it isn't his place, but it hasn't stopped him to date.
t1_ds1jx0p	1	*	As thick as thieves would've been better. Chalk and cheese is a metaphor for when things are different
t1_ds1exsk	0	*	It's an excellent demonstration of the incredible effectiveness of terror as a weapon. 20 years on and people still can't help themselves but dance to bin Laden's tune.
t1_ds1evsw	0	*	It's either that or let the nation turn back into a breeding ground for terrorism.
t1_ds1oej5	0	*	... Yes. Which will be true once you cut it.

t1_ds1odcf	0	*	> naively   You would be completely retarded if you think the arms trade isn't profitable.
t1_ds1uhyg	0	*	I'll answer your question, Trump knew they were gonna be against him. Maybe he used Pakistan's predictability to drive them into a corner, he has been very very vocal about ending terrorrism.
t1_ds1unv0	0	*	That is certainly not true.  http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/trumpometer/
t1_ds1dheq	0	*	Do you really think the leader would sign something implicating them? Leaders can issue covert orders to protect themselves.
t1_ds1fsyr	1	*	Weird how people blow off our country spending money on a country that provides safe harbor for individuals that jumps its borders and kills our troops. 
t1_ds27vk4	1	*	Which prince? Any source

t1_ds1or52	0	*	Well atleat they can use that money to improve their infrastructure instead of wasting it in pakistan 
t1_ds1ncna	0	*	Is it not fact that she sent classified material?  That is criminal. Just because political corruption protected her doesn't mean she is innocent.
t1_ds1kmuf	1	*	You know an alternative to that would be to just be stricter on immigration... Terrorists can't kill people if they can't get there. It's not like Al Qaeda or the Taliban have ICBMs.
t1_ds1fkhg	1	*	Maybe not reliable to fire over vast distances, but we're talking about them firing them at their neighbors.

t1_ds1ew8c	1	*	As in, leave the fucking region. 
t1_ds1hdd5	1	*	I dont think they were terrorist back then. And not all the groups turned out to be terrorists. Apparently the northern alliance were good rebels
t1_ds1ehnn	0	*	It is, hence the empires formation of pakistan
t1_ds1sys5	1	*	So is r/socialism r/democrats r/Bluemidterms2018 and several others. Criticizing only r/T_D is unfair and biased  
t1_ds1ga8q	1	*	No doubt. I don't know if I would thank him for ISIS, that was decades of failed middle eastern policy. But I literally said his biggest blunder was the withdrawal plan. 
t1_ds1f03d	1	*	Please do. They will be welcomed. Considering the Indian army struggles to kill teenage boys, no one is quaking in their boots.
t1_ds20twt	1	*	True. We could have gotten bin Laden 20 years earlier, before 9/11, before the USS Cole. But Clinton decided not to kill him.

t1_dsnrspa	0	*	what about criticism?
t1_dutyrdt	0	*	So when exactly in the last 40 or so years has the US instituted a regime change when they didn't have nukes?
t1_duty4j3	0	*	The party voted to remove term limits. The UK also has no term limits. Term limits aren't the sole deciding factor between dictatorship and democracy
t1_dutinrw	0	*	Sorry, I'm already married.
t1_dutt04l	0	*	We have not attacked since the ceasefire in 1953.  If we had wanted to we could have at any time.  He is in more danger with the nukes than without them.
t1_dusv7yh	0	*	what stopped us before they completed their nuclear missiles?
t1_dut2xdq	0	*	Moon gives credit where credit is due which is why he gave it to Trump.
t1_dutfs3p	1	*	Bitch I gave you the timestamps.  Stop lying.
t1_dut6y93	1	*	The reason I posted this poll is because it was the one the original commenter was referencing. Whether or not it is right leaning I cannot say, as I do not know the history of Rasmussen. 
t1_du2yga3	1	*	Yes, correct, I was just trying to say that when flying VFR, you are relying on your eyes, and other pilots eyes, as well as hopefully tower to keep you clear... As for conditions you are correct... 
t1_du31df2	1	*	That's not how statistics work
t1_du2x83r	1	*	No, It's an ethnicity 
t1_du3at3j	0	*	Seems like that might make a good movie staring Tom Hanks and Denzel Washington.
t1_du2wewi	0	*	 Yeah seems like it was just 11 minutes ago
t1_du36lqy	0	*	Why do you feel the need to randomly shit on Russia?
t1_du3gfm1	1	*	Great idea.  Next flight I take, I'm bringing my laptop, joystick, headset and running flight simulator on the same stretch I am flying.
t1_du2wimg	0	*	That doesn't sound right, but I don't know enough about probability to refute it.
t1_du2zo30	1	*	So we can stop talking about slavery?  Or Nazis? Or the gulags?  A nation is composed of it's people, it's laws, and it's history
t1_du31jal	0	*	Bixby told me the plane was falling at 1300 feet per minute.. doesn't seem very fast 
t1_du2wkvp	0	*	yeah, that's crazy. I'm sure in every flight that's ever crashed, there's been someone on board who was afraid of flying/crashing. Just shit luck
t1_du346s9	0	*	Even in the instances of being lost at sea?
t1_du3xnf6	1	*	Then i think you should read about TACA flight 110.
t1_du324xz	0	*	Yes.  Civilian plane, flying a known civilian route at speeds of a civilian plane. The aftermath was a ridiculous thing as well. Overall shameful for the US but sadly forgotten by many. 
t1_du37ym2	0	*	> we dropped what felt like 20 or 30 feet straight down.  if it helps any, it was probably much much more, probably in the magnitude of hundreds of feet.
t1_du35ov2	0	*	I'm sorry, can you provide evidence that what I was said was wrong? Bonus points for not linking to fake news websites.
t1_du30t99	0	*	How about swear on me nan's grave?
t1_du2wmry	0	*	[If my flight to Malaysia disappears, this is what it looks like](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/10975127/If-my-flight-to-Malaysia-disappears-this-is-what-it-looks-like.html)
t1_du2xsuj	1	*	In Soviet Russia planes crash into you while being struck by lightning walking down the street. 
t1_du35wrb	1	*	Dont give them too much credit; a master wouldnt be so obvious.
t1_du33pia	1	*	What do I do with his bags and return ticket. Secret Santa rafflle from the grave miles. 
t1_du3b6qu	1	*	Ive never read this story.  Wow!  Thanks for the link! 
t1_du31vat	1	*	>I think swear on my mums ~~life~~ ***tits*** is still honoured too  
t1_du31sam	0	*	I think the point he's trying to illustrate is that in a plane crash you have a much longer time to contemplate your demise. That's a sobering thought.
t1_du2xnv0	0	*	Cause that would be wrong?
t1_du4zia9	1	*	Yes, but I suppose we would have had completely different digestive system in a 2D world.
t1_du30lps	1	*	There's more chances of you dying in a car accident so I wouldn't worry too much. 
t1_du2wji2	0	*	But after they realized, they put a whole bunch of extra phalanges onboard. Just in case.
t1_du346w4	1	*	It previously sounded more like he was saying probably wise. He edited the comment to clarify.
t1_du2wuif	0	*	9-11 wasn't a crash.  And the last fatal in the US on a US airline was in 2009.
t1_du312yi	0	*	Age  Sex Location   Edit: I thought you were asking what asl meant.
t1_du3m226	1	*	Looks like I picked the wrong week to quit amphetamines
t1_du3ddla	1	*	Ok, so maybe I'm dumb but why in the world would you put curtains in the cockpit of an airplane? Even when in the air on autopilot, someone should be, at least, looking around.
t1_du3fs8x	0	*	It's a substantially lower risk than people seem to be implying
t1_du397e5	0	*	So what caused this crash?
t1_du2z7df	0	*	How big a gap is it to the next country?
t1_du2wz8m	1	*	The survivors probably apologized to the land owner they crashed on, while the pilot was apologizing to the passengers.
t1_du3bsy2	1	*	Reminds me of this lucky/unlucky guy  https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/304a77/airliner_crashes_in_french_alps/cpoze0l/
t1_du32xni	1	*	Everyday is one step closer to every future catastrophe.
t1_du391tj	1	*	Considering the BBC's nickname, probably best to skip this one...
t1_du2wk9z	0	*	UK, The kings of queuing, would be most definitely be more strict about queuing.
t1_du31d44	0	*	Totally. The whole mentality of sleep when youre dead and youre a wuss and need to suck it up if you cant go 3 days without sleeping? Its torture. I feel for those people.
t1_du356sd	0	*	Okay, but only if you admit you're an asshole to people sometimes and do stupid shit as much as you think other people do.
t1_du30waf	1	*	Piggybacking off this one, flight is tomorrow 
t1_du37wnz	1	*	Thanks pal. 
t1_du2w6h8	0	*	Could Not Diagnose? Cake Not Donut?
t1_du2vtvk	1	*	Ah, I had heard it disappeared shortly after takeoff, but it wasnt specific about how shortly. A few minutes can make a big difference in aircraft flight.
t1_du30xcu	0	*	> in the UK they repeat it and then request you acknowledge it in 10 seconds  That sounds like the smart thing to do tbh.
t1_du2w3pn	0	*	you're god damn right
t1_du36uuq	1	*	Cool, just looked it up! Thanks for letting me know, Im definitely going to check it out.
t1_du2y1wk	0	*	This guy gets it. Also driving a car can be fun. 
t1_du2wuts	0	*	There was, actually, in Indonesia
t1_du32fho	0	*	Captain Sully crashing his plane into river in New York too 
t1_du2wo4o	0	*	I'm Vlad this pun thread isn't taking off
t1_du2wdbg	0	*	I didn't state that assumption, but it certainly seemed that way as I met more and more of the family's friends. Couldn't stand it.
t1_du37sa8	1	*	I'd advise against 4,500 fpm all day long. If my math is correct, that's: 4500 ft/min * 1400 min/dy * 1 dy = 6,480,000 ft ~ 1,220 miles
t1_du34297	1	*	It's for my family. They care.
t1_du38a0a	0	*	It's not business practice, it's more like tax since the government owns the bbc
t1_du36kjn	0	*	This is wrong, almost all commercial planes have a glide ratio of at least 15:1.  That's over 200km from 40k feet.  Shortly after takeoff you just won't have the altitude to glide very far. 
t1_du306sm	1	*	'Those' refers to instances of death. I'm no doctor but I don't think you can potentially survive death.
t1_du352vm	1	*	Obviously is talking about his ability to potential avoid the collision on his end...
t1_du2wqxy	0	*	A passenger plane with 260 people on it crashed into a residential area Queens, NY two months after 9/11/01. I think it often gets lost in the shuffle. Edit: 2 months after, not 1 month
t1_du2wms4	0	*	Gee wow. Thanks for the education. Can you direct me to where on the census I can mark Jewish for my race? Thanks.
t1_du39ve7	1	*	Dude, I was kind of enjoying that pressurized cabin. Youre ruining it for everyone. 
t1_du51duz	0	*	Yes, but when the plane is actually in the air those odds jump to 0%...  They count on runway accidents as crashes which heavily skews the statistics.
t1_du2yfio	0	*	No, I say that like there were not 11 school shootings in a month. I'm all for having a conversation, but don't be dishonest in your argument.
t1_du30n5g	1	*	I dunno why do you  > use Flight Aware to track the flights of people I care about and onboard my own flights in realtime.  in the first place?  
t1_du2xf3h	0	*	Guess I picked the wrong week to stop sniffing cocaine. (I don't really enjoy it, I just like the way it smells) 
t1_du2y9fl	0	*	Hatred of Xena, warrior princess
t1_du35ykm	1	*	Looking at you, person in 12B, playing your movie at full volume with no headphones. 
t1_du2wkmp	0	*	I am aware of that. His point was that you could not be both Russian and Jewish.
t1_du3erd3	1	*	Yeah man what the fuck. I'm shook. Well shook.
t1_du313za	0	*	Being killed in a car accident is not potentially survivable
t1_du2xt5x	0	*	...and they still aren't saying that Russian is a race - only Caucasian.  
t1_du53jdn	1	*	One bottle of vodka deducted from their salaries.
t1_du3aenu	1	*	Good read.
t1_du3c1hf	1	*	The Eurostar is not THAT bad!
t1_du3fa9w	0	*	So nothing from USA, UK, Australia or NZ?
t1_du31ccc	0	*	Just so you know your joke didn't complete go to waste.
t1_du38xtg	1	*	I do that when I go kayaking.  Which (last time) lead to freak out texts from a co-worker when the news posted about a man that went missing kayaking a couple hours later.
t1_du2wf95	1	*	He's the only ex I completely cut out of my life immediately after breaking up. There is nothing to be gained in associating with him.
t1_du32kgj	1	*	Yeah probably.
t1_du3erxk	1	*	Good point.
t1_du38wg6	1	*	I suggest you to put your hands in the yellow circles and freeze then.  
t1_du329bn	0	*	They've just been doing it the longest so they got to pick the units. Metric would still be better.
t1_du3pz6o	0	*	I took my joystick out during a flight once and got arrested for public indecency.  
t1_du3idiq	1	*	I guess if I had a root beer and cigarette.
t1_du2xdv0	1	*	If you count miltary too, we've had quite of few of those
t1_du34l66	0	*	Almost all of those accidents are minor scrapes on the runway. If we counted every time I hit the curb while driving as an accident then car accidents would have a 99.9999% survival rate.
t1_du312zh	0	*	Just like the US and pretty much everybody else? 
t1_du309d1	0	*	Look at this condescending american denying the truth. 
t1_du31bpl	1	*	...or the ocean
t1_du2waks	0	*	Sorry.... 
t1_du2x4yl	1	*	I thought reputation for aviation accidents meant their own crashes, as in their airlines are bad. My apologies.
t1_du38vth	0	*	You could always listen to the radio
t1_du2vauh	1	*	Its aight 
t1_du35nsz	1	*	My mom said that happened to her when she was 18 going to Hawaii by herself. Pilot said it was an air pocket but Im guessing now this is actually what happened. Or close to it 
t1_du354su	0	*	Do you support gun ownership?
t1_du32kt0	1	*	Even so many of the accidents are the result of pilot error so getting rid of soviet planes doesn't completely fix the incompetence of pilots.
t1_du3122l	0	*	Same but they knew how they would die. You do not. 
t1_du3rt70	1	*	No one has ever survived a shark attack while traveling on a train. 
t1_du2wq7i	1	*	Sure. My point was about the aggressive stupid put down, not semantics of English colloquialisms. 
t1_ducv67q	0	*	Think [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/7wsix0/russian_plane_missing_after_moscow_take_off/duc7zm2/) is directed at you as well as me :-)
t1_du31u9d	1	*	I believe people still sneak in, 'swear on your mums life'
t1_du2wuib	1	*	U0001f602  That's rich YOU calling me a child!! Rough day on the internet?
t1_du38d78	1	*	I mean Im outside with sunglasses on but that looks like Salsa.
t1_dtu29pq	1	*	I should have said in related to the collapse. 
t1_dttzfhf	0	*	I will make a note of that and be on the lookout in future threads! And then perhaps I will up-vote you and wish you a good day just to get you riled.
t1_dt5szfb	1	*	I live ten minutes walk from Crown Casino! 
t1_dt4phwk	0	*	Please go on, because you're listing a bunch of impossible things.  If you don't have money, you can simply start a business.  Oh, haha. Okay.
t1_dt4qqx0	0	*	And yet, China is a shithole in some ways. What's the difference? 
t1_dt5xphn	0	*	Thats why we elect people to make laws and enforce laws
t1_dt5rarw	1	*	He does seem to post on the_donald an awful lot...
t1_dt5meba	0	*	With respect, I think it's quite clear and my point was one of a conflict of interest, just as I would be poorly placed to explain the position of Libertarians. 
t1_dt4uzhg	1	*	Can I get a source on that, please?  I've never heard that before...  
t1_dt5c4xs	0	*	Nobody cares what a the_donald member thinks. 
t1_dt4sd3z	0	*	Chinese are buying up the west coast, what are you talking about. 
t1_dt64izl	0	*	It's not passive aggressive, it's aggressive aggressive. Don't get mad that I called out your retarded political opinions.
t1_dt4tk6r	0	*	Thats the US. The majority of non-US countries are not as welcome to large immigration of people who arent engineers or doctors.
t1_dt4t06e	0	*	I mean, if they were the same in talent, education, skills, etc. then theres really no reason we should prioritize Europe over Africa.
t1_dt5c1lz	0	*	It's almost as if decent people don't want to deport thousands of innocents to countries simply for no crime whatsoever.
t1_dt9g17j	0	*	Just because the problem is smaller doesnt mean we should ignore it 
t1_duyt61l	1	*	Ill concede your points but there are a lot of labour or nothing people out there. Theyd vote labour if I ran, and I wouldnt vote for me.
t1_dsvtxfj	0	*	They do want it and they deserve it
t1_dsw5fgm	0	*	Thats kind of the same premise behind The Lorax! 
t1_dsvo1xd	1	*	Seems you don't understand what being part of America is
t1_dsvp9tx	0	*	Evidently if you think $2000 is chump change.
t1_duqezk6	1	*	So in other words; everyone else can bother with recycling but I'm perfectly happy with flytipping?
t1_ds4rlll	1	*	If you're only hiring experienced employees you're not introducing any new talent into the market.  Someone has to do that part.
t1_ds56vl8	0	*	No worries! I had a project where everyone spoke Tamil, I think it's a case ending language right where as Telugu, this project, is tonal in some ways? 
t1_ds505jw	1	*	Sorry, it was rude of me to use the acronyms and I am bad at explaining G things at times haha.(just read a thread on how annoying it is.) I'll pm you. 
t1_ds4olh5	0	*	I am an IT executive with 20 years of experience, including working on several outsourcing projects.
t1_ds4ovfz	1	*	More precisely, the budgets are such that companies do not compete well for good workers or retain good people. This gap is filled by cheap but poor quality workers who slow progress.
t1_ds4zb12	0	*	no, they get to work without paying taxes until their school visa runs out. thats what you said. A school visa is an F1. 
t1_ds4wqzg	1	*	Im glad you see that
t1_ds4p0yp	0	*	Do I really need to unpack how you've applied the experience of senior people at top tier companies to the industry as a whole?
t1_ds4s7p5	0	*	>You can't tax that  We can, and do (and are getting better at it). Or do you think every software company only pays taxes in the country it produces code in?
t1_ds4lggj	1	*	As someone primarily self-taught, I agree.
t1_ds4ol8v	1	*	Bingo.  They said pays $70k, but without knowing where that's a meaningless figure.  Some places that's well above entry level engineer salary, others it's barely above poverty level.
t1_du21bvg	1	*	Lol, i know. But im not really, so i gave you the winkie face. 
t1_du2650e	1	*	Nice assumptions you are making there buddy U0001f44c 
t1_du0za0x	0	*	If you wish to consult the sources I have posted and read for yourself, you may do so. If not, that's fine too.   
t1_dsdqqjr	0	*	Ah, so you have no idea. Youve just jumped on the outrage bandwagon. Thought so.
t1_dsfltpx	1	*	That's a refreshingly honest perspective on it. Thanks for taking the time to reply.
t1_dsdy1d6	0	*	Who do you like more Kamala Harris, wife of Obama, or daughter of Clinton, they all can beat Trump secure.
t1_dus1sd5	0	*	You think the FISA judge wouldnt be filing a complaint if they were lied too? I they would speak out about being lied to, especially to the Trump administration. 
t1_dt6kgjh	1	*	They can open for my new band, Revolver Oscillate 
t1_ds9wytv	1	*	thanks

t1_duktmoy	0	*	Oooooo.
t1_dul9hx2	0	*	Sure there is homophobia, but it's very mild comparing to e.g. Saudi Arabia, which are very good friends to US. Doesn't US foreign policy hurt your conscience?

t1_dt4ciz8	0	*	He was. You'll be OK. Deep breath. 
t1_dsoa09j	1	*	If that's how you're taking it, sure. Regardless, the conversation got derailed by my comment so it defeated its own purpose.
t1_dsmtq8b	0	*	in that case I invite europe to revert back 241 years of time.
t1_dtkfnyo	1	*	>What can I say, my country is currently full of idiots  You are far from the only one so I feel your pain, there. 
t1_dtod9tn	0	*	I just looked it up for Washington DC. Up to ten years for assaulting an officer of the law.  Keep in mind that they arrested her after she's been doing this for years.
t1_dt9t5am	1	*	Which could just as well happen in this case.
t1_dta0ep6	1	*	Thats not slander.  Defamation is different than a direct verbal insult.
t1_dta4n3g	1	*	I don't see any significant differences between the two, so logically speaking, yes.
t1_dtbu20y	1	*	You're totally correct. I jimmy mean pre-law as in doing a philosophy/poli-sci major in order to get into law school, which is a fairly common thing.
t1_dt9xa30	0	*	Graduated with a degree in civil engineering and your comment is bs. sorry, but if you were going to rely on memorization, you'd fail in your first semester lol
t1_dta621d	0	*	I wonder if those crops died not for lack of workers, but for lack of workers willing to work for pennies. 
t1_dt9xm3l	0	*	/s ruins jokes  It dulls the humor for people who get it, and it barely adds anything for those who dont get it.  /s makes you mediocre 
t1_dt9wl18	0	*	But they did come up with mistaking Austria for Australia.
t1_dt9xg90	0	*	Find me a single developed country that elected someone even remotely close to as bad as Trump, the closest you're going to get is Italy. Even that isn't close.
t1_dt9yfhf	0	*	Nobody has ever said that, but it's the mental gymnastics they have to do in order to believe drones are a cause of civilian casualties and not any weapon in foreign wars in general.
t1_dtaxaw2	1	*	I refuse to justify abusing anyone.  Have a very nice weekend.
t1_dtaw4i9	1	*	Then I guess I can't help you. Read it a couple more times, think hard about the context and maybe you can find the answer to your own question
t1_dt9zwq8	1	*	I see, that the storys about British food are true after all.
t1_dtaycil	0	*	You guys must be really thin skinned 
t1_dtaj155	1	*	Im glad you think so. If you educate yourself on the subject youll find your comment comical. 
t1_dtawprs	1	*	People are dicks. I honestly wouldnt notice what anyone called me and they could call me any one of those, I dont care. Why do people get so worked up about something so trivial?

t1_dtfib7n	1	*	I appreciate the clarification though... Thank you.
t1_dta36o8	1	*	Definitely not. Germany has the same problem, although less severe. There needs to be a police for the police, so that complains about a cop don't go to the colleagues...
t1_dta7d30	1	*	lol
t1_dtacfwi	0	*	Yes you can lol. Depending on who said it, when, about who, where etc... it could be classified as slander here too 
t1_dtahvj8	0	*	So I'm guessing your next username will continue the pattern and be peetpeetpeetpeetpeet?
t1_dtafdhg	1	*	Why do you think so?  I for one think it's not okay to attack other people verbally with the intent to mentally harm them and that is exactly what the law was created to prevent. 
t1_dtaumh6	0	*	What? 
t1_dtasaj1	0	*	The semantics of language is fucking interesting, thanks for the lesson! It definitely makes more sense how it's even more disgusting to say in that context
t1_dta00w7	1	*	Nuclear physics is boring as shit, all the interesting work was done 50+ years ago. Nuclear *engineering* though is still a lot of fun because there's always some new crap to try to build.
t1_dta60rs	0	*	This is not really comparable. /u/kazga makes a good point comparing it to bail money instead of civil forfeiture. A law like this does not really exist in Germany.
t1_dta7e1y	0	*	Undercut... but damn close.
t1_dta3hvs	0	*	Yes, it is.
t1_dta25m4	0	*	You're lieing  Edit: Sure, downvote but you better have data in hand. Else you can suck on your own BS.
t1_dtacxo1	1	*	I'll take that as a no. Somewhere else a self-described brown person refutes this claim with personal experience and I'm sure no  statistics exist, backing your claim.
t1_dta1mti	1	*	drinking Foster's is like makin' love in a canoe. It's fuckin' close to water, mate.
t1_dtaames	1	*	Ah, we've got one of the Only because the US pays for your defence! people here, just saying it in more amicable terms.  If any other people come here to say that, no, that's not the case.

t1_dta3q2a	1	*	No anti Semitism here unless theres Antigermanism. Dont dish it out if you cant take it,bish. Thats my motto
t1_dta0m8j	1	*	Yeah, they didn't make the cut! Facial to the face of those insignificant pawns of society!!
t1_dta0xc9	1	*	For extreme cases. And sometimes it is enforced, but most people just won't bother. These cases are pretty rare. But yeah, it is fairly petty.
t1_dta6atw	1	*	yea, and also having knowledge on how to manipulate those facts 
t1_dtaceem	0	*	Oh okay, so just most of them. But not all. It's funny because you think that makes what you said reasonable 
t1_dta8x0u	1	*	sound like a bunch of fuckin nazis
t1_dt9wpkd	0	*	Fields that require memorizing facts = All of them.  I was gonna write except STEM, but then you HAVE to memorize a lot of stuff to be able to implement it or solve problems so yeah..
t1_dta1w8v	0	*	Using the numeral system created by the Arabs too.
t1_dtaphtu	0	*	I've never been pulled over for going 5 over either, but what can I really say if I do?
t1_dta60vh	0	*	The people
t1_dtadwlr	0	*	Oh no! Some empty shirt on the internet doesn't like my post history! I'll have to take a Valium. Wait out.  
t1_dta518z	0	*	Ok. I see where they are coming from, but I would be a bit worried in Germany that I would say something which isn't offensive in the states, but offends someone there.   
t1_dtbb3q7	1	*	Ukemi is something everybody should learn, but nobody ever does.
t1_dt9wysg	0	*	Oh you're gonna get so much shit for this   *pulls out popcorn*
t1_dta03iw	0	*	Thanks man 
t1_dta3o4s	1	*	All that text yet you can't even answer my question.
t1_dtaleey	1	*	That's a really bad version of one.
t1_dtasozt	0	*	I, for one, enjoy watching people hoisted on their own petard far too much to share your sentiment. 
t1_dt9xjum	1	*	I'm sorry, weren't you trying to paint this as an anti-white thing?
t1_dta0htd	0	*	Fuck, my cover is blown.   I mean eh yeah, haha mitochondria, right? Crazy stuff.  ^^^^^My ^^^^^entire ^^^^^house ^^^^^is ^^^^^filled ^^^^^with ^^^^^Nazi ^^^^^memorabilia.   
t1_dtd932n	1	*	Got me, don't know how I'll ever recover. Must be hard for you to interact with people. Have fun being a bitter asshole behind a monitor all day.
t1_dtawxu8	0	*	Same in the US. I was just mentioning it because its definitely different over there!
t1_dta3sdl	1	*	And there are some other people who communicate with emotes outside twitch. 
t1_dtcth3u	0	*	I came inside a milf on Sunday. Nice projecting :)
t1_dta4gxq	1	*	But he's wrong.
t1_dt9s17g	1	*	I couldn't agree more.  
t1_dtan0tu	0	*	You would probably be detained in the USA, but I don't think you would be given a slander ticket/or arrested for it. Either way she seems like a real piece of shit.
t1_dta85xn	1	*	Everyone should agree with him.
t1_dt9x4hn	1	*	Apparently the Nazis didn't like to play either. 
t1_dtaqd5p	1	*	Obviously. The lady is right in her claim and she should have the backing of the international community. /s
t1_dta5kde	0	*	> a ton of people who will call you a nazi for saying youre a republican  nope, just not true
t1_dtagmye	0	*	Can you not see that calling someone a nazi in Germany could be especially offensive???
t1_dta3b0r	0	*	The thing that you just typed out is honestly so far beyond stupid that I'm not even sure which part I hate the most.
t1_dta3xpr	0	*	Depends on your color
t1_dta5hdo	1	*	> They prevented another 9/11 style attack the day they put locks on the cockpit doors.
t1_dtam7u5	0	*	And to add further, the act of thought policing and policing people's criticism of authority is classic nazism. Kind of ironic. 
t1_dt9y3m9	1	*	Totally bro! Facial them laypeople up!!
t1_dtads9w	1	*	Mitochondria follow a matriarchal line of descent,   ^those ^feminist ^bitches!
t1_dtac9dy	0	*	The behavior she displayed so far makes me strongly believe she will actually appeal any fine and will insist on getting an actual trial. 
t1_dt9xawe	0	*	Exactly. Tons of philosophy people go into coding type careers. I suppose it undermines their worldview if lowly liberal arts people can get well-respected STEM jobs, though
t1_dta29of	0	*	Sir, you must now prove that the concept is strange to an American or I will report you to the German police for hurting my feelings and insulting my intelligence.
t1_dtalh40	0	*	Not in America. In America, liberal is left, centrist is centrist and conservative is right. 
t1_dta6232	1	*	He put all his skill points into Dexterity and used Intelligence as his dump stat.
t1_dt9xc4g	1	*	Hey we also know 95 percent of Australia wild life is designed to end human life and promote fear of nature Edit: also Crocodile Dundee 
t1_dtckkqj	0	*	AMERICA IS THE BEST WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IF IT ISNT REFERENCING RACIST COMMENTS IN YOUR POST AND SAYING AMERICA IS SO BAD BECAUSE THE RACISM   Your problem isn't being asian, it's being a dense moron.
t1_dtajrod	1	*	you mean the people in America that proudly identify as communists? 
t1_dtash1m	1	*	This sounds a whole lot like Texas
t1_dtavjcc	0	*	How does Bavaria tolerate the refugee problems as compared to the remainder of Germany?
t1_dt9yf66	1	*	Finally some sense.   Stricter gun laws = more relaxed police/society
t1_dt9xrmu	0	*	Leaky anus is the important one to remember on dates
t1_dtb3tek	1	*	Obviously I need to write a letter of complaint to my math teachers
t1_dt9wbcv	0	*	You don't need a degree to know this stuff.
t1_dt9z3ia	1	*	There are many jobs more dangerous than policemen, you don't see garbage collectors just randomly shoot at stuff.
t1_dta7ppg	0	*	> but calling a white person cracker not crossing the line?  Calling a white person cracker with the intent to insult them falls under the exact same law as this case in Germany.
t1_dtaakaw	1	*	>Only in America would someone .... who advocates extra-judicial targeted assassinations on foreign soil could be anything other than a conservative reactionary.  In the USSR (R.I.P.) too.
t1_dt9xxej	0	*	So what you claimed didn't happen then?
t1_dt9z476	1	*	There are many jobs more dangerous than police, you don't see garbage collectors just randomly shoot at stuff.
t1_dtapl72	1	*	Of course ideally the number would be zero.  And murders would be zero, assaults, rapes, burglary, etc.  We are not, and never will be in an ideal world because some people suck.
t1_dta1vh4	0	*	So... what you're saying is that I should move to Germany?
t1_dta455p	0	*	My heart goes out to you then friend. You have one of the most under-appreciated professions in the world, which is terribly, terribly sad
t1_dtbetr4	0	*	Also filthy rich. 
t1_dtc7e9h	1	*	It becomes funny when countries occupied by Britain and France start being on the list of independent nations submitted by Roosevelt
t1_dt9x7g8	0	*	Just do it back. Be a fun person, not a negative one
t1_dta0l3u	0	*	Come on! Zoos don't count?
t1_dt9zs2r	1	*	we could be married by now, my love. If only your home country was a typo
t1_dt9wy2m	1	*	My point exactly. Her Stem degree didn't help with teaching compassion or empathy or how to be a decent human being. 
t1_dt9pz4u	0	*	A lot of them yeah. I'm not exactly going to blame the Swedes. It is Americans fault that their political landscape is so toxic.
t1_dta9y0h	0	*	So do think it would have been fair to fine all the people calling conservatives nazis last year?
t1_dta17ja	0	*	>     That's bananas. >  >  >  > That's potassium!  That's Vitamin B-6!
t1_dt9yytw	1	*	> I wonder if they think are entitled to sue others for using the word nazi as well? Or may be collect royalties from movies etc  Ah here is the unhinged speculator.
t1_dt9sdij	1	*	People are entitled to their own opinions, even if they are against what the masses deem to be appropriate. Thinking something and acting upon it are 2 very different things.
t1_dtastoe	1	*	And for that you have the reward of living in a rude society, where speech not worth being protected is valued higher than attitudes which are worth far more.
t1_dta5gy4	0	*	He's lying. I just edited to put the last full stop.
t1_dta9vip	0	*	Yeah cept this isn't the US, it's Germany, so whatever those guys do across the Atlantic means shit in this case.
t1_dta5cob	0	*	What makes you think that the deposit fine is more similar to civil forfeiture than to bail money? 
t1_dta0ace	1	*	> Marmite on on pork schnitzel is actually not bad  Just no, never do that again.
t1_dta1d5z	0	*	That's pretty normal, imagine if police would enforce every tiny traffic law... It's not practical and that's why these laws only get enforced in the extreme cases. 
t1_dt9yt54	0	*	I already stated both are despicable.  Of course the Israeli government kill more, they vastly outnumber and outgunned their opposition. 
t1_dta8ljb	0	*	Holy shit you're right  Just tried it, works, new party trick
t1_dta5m80	0	*	Ok, so at what point do you put up a fuss? What if it was your shoes? They look funny in the x-ray, they gotta go.. you're cool? Just get in line, look down, and keep moving?
t1_dtc6pjm	1	*	^^^wat
t1_dtaqjwp	1	*	well you are lucky. they indeed seem to have not even started at BER
t1_dt9ymnh	0	*	That's not even being dumb. That's us being stupid.
t1_dtabxkp	1	*	Laugh out loud!!!!
t1_dta0r5u	0	*	I mean... Trump kinda is a racist and far right for sure. A Nazi? No (yet at least) 
t1_dtap829	1	*	Punks wear undercut?
t1_dtah1vi	0	*	I feel like you're reading a lot of stuff I didn't say.  
t1_dtaw05n	0	*	You don't know what a white knight is do you? 
t1_dtatf4r	0	*	Thats because solid deodorant is not considered a liquid. 
t1_dtbcdcn	1	*	Correct!! If you want to make sure nobody can make a joke about it, just say Anfxfchrer instead of Fxfchrer.
t1_dtac0pa	1	*	This guy's appeal wasn't successful.   http://nationalpost.com/news/canada/supreme-court-upholds-decision-to-force-comedian-to-pay-15000-for-tirade-of-ugly-words-against-lesbian-heckler
t1_dt9yki2	1	*	Absolutely fucking amazing. She was a former hooker and was currently a dancer while attending college. She also liked the girls as well. It was The Perfect Storm
t1_dtah9x8	1	*	Haaave you met Russia?
t1_dta6s98	0	*	Sorry, I don't believe you. Not without some idea of her reasoning. That's just too dumb. 
t1_dtayp92	1	*	How wude. [ Insert full house gif I'm too lazy to find ]
t1_dta6c1e	0	*	Are you willfully missing the point of his argument?  
t1_dtb3b64	0	*	I think someone would step in then. But that's such a shitty argument they do something I personally don't agree with but would you agree with it if they killed people?
t1_dta6iy3	0	*	You know whats a pretty cool thing about freedom of speech? That we are allowed to have a discussion about what is being covered by it. 
t1_dtaxm0t	1	*	I want some group of radical idiots to start getting offended at sir so that gender equality maybe maintained and we can all enjoy the ensuing laughter.
t1_dta8fkt	0	*	1. 2. Pay a fine  Only if you agree to it. Otherwise you can still wait for them to take you to court and have the same process.
t1_dtapnn6	1	*	Stupid to keep braking the law, yea maybe. But you're even stupider if you forget the punishment must fit the crime, and become content with bullshit laws. 
t1_dta206b	1	*	Edgy but wrong. That's more of an anger management problem. Snowflakes would probably be more prone to contemplating suicide.
t1_dtazhih	1	*	Absolutely nothing.
t1_dtawliy	0	*	>Insults are not an opinion  They are by American standards.  >you can voice any opinion you have in Germany  Clearly you can't.
t1_dt9z2cl	0	*	Yeah- Im agreeing with you. 
t1_dtbjrrl	0	*	Again, no proofs fine. Your fact was bullshit anyway. 
t1_dw1pb4j	1	*	well German law is written for German society so it doesn't really matter what others think, if you don't like it then hopefully you live somewhere different
t1_dtabrz7	0	*	Oh, they turned up.  https://www.wired.com/story/alt-right-charlottesville-reddit-4chan/  They even tried to blame her death on 'leftists' or on the fact she was overweight.  Sickening really.
t1_dtagsks	1	*	Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker, tits...might get you into trouble in certain situations. 
t1_dtjoz7r	0	*	> I hope you get colon cancer and your dog is raped by someone other than yourself (for once)  rude
t1_dtbjdmo	0	*	Slander is only a crime if the injured party presses charges. Unlike murder for example which is always a crime.
t1_dtcahtj	1	*	You mean the Neuland?
t1_dta6dzw	0	*	If your police did that could you call them nazis or would you be jailed and/or sued?
t1_dta3anm	1	*	So I should just look in the mirror?
t1_dtcfbhr	1	*	I agree! She was out of order. I just think theyre being a little too sensitive about this. Thats all.
t1_dt9wme8	1	*	Who cares it was funny
t1_dtai03u	0	*	Yes, because its everyone elses problem that Germans freak out when you call them Nazis. Penalize others cause your country did fucked up stuff back in the day and it upsets you. Great solution. 
t1_dtaanf2	0	*	Did they chant blood and soil? 
t1_dtaa3pj	1	*	How would you do that? The police won't let you go without paying.
t1_dta9qqr	1	*	All other countries have inferior potassium!
t1_dta9h2c	0	*	Salty downvotes incoming.
t1_dt9xcit	0	*	Yes, the Australian Tourism Commission. They were literally poking fun at their own selves. And that is a very generalized opinion to say that is the only thing Americans know about Australia. 
t1_dt9ydfu	1	*	Yes you are?      Had I not said anything, I wouldn't be in the cell. Don't bring some semantic to it that your charge isn't saying a bad word, it's disturbing the peace! How disingenuous. 
t1_dta8wxe	1	*	Hungarians? Yes, they came to our country as refugees when here was a civil war in theirs.
t1_dta22e9	0	*	I see taxes as the price for a proper civilization. I gladly pay them.
t1_dta8rly	0	*	someone = fascists. I'm just glad it's not our problem yet. Crossing my fingers you guys get your shit sorted out before the damage is irreversible. 
t1_dtahild	1	*	What you cant drink in public in the usa, what a fascist country! Where is the freedom? And what normal human being gender parts are forbidden, fascist country! Where is the freedom? 
t1_dtaeb33	0	*	If you are unhappy with the status quo, do not try and improve it, just leave said every conservative ever
t1_dt9zn79	0	*	Almost all university graduates will admit that.
t1_dtaw46u	1	*	I mean she was showing it to me on paper, just not the file.
t1_dtactco	0	*	Is District Attorney a good translation?
t1_dtafs6r	0	*	Yeah, reading that article, I was actually with her up until the haircut remark and the refusal to let the deodorant go.
t1_dtao6cw	0	*	Hahaha.  Warm?  I wouldn't go that far.  Kind of a ... chill amused seriousness?  :P
t1_dt9yak1	0	*	Nah, most of you are pretty cool, only your dumbasses are somehow so much louder. 
t1_dta3zlu	0	*	By too far left, I think he means they're absorbed by special interests.  But you're ~~right~~ correct, and I'm glad I wasn't the one who had to explain it again.
t1_dt9spfv	1	*	Who cares?  Are we having an on-topic discussion, or have we switched it over to quirky statistics fun hour?
t1_dt9y5sc	1	*	This is a real spicy one 
t1_dtag8ut	1	*	Fuckin Canadian geeselingq
t1_dta7oz9	1	*	No, you need a degree to be ethical ya doofus.
t1_dta9i6s	1	*	Both are considered insults, the former is usually even considered worse because it's deliberate instead of just a strong reaction.
t1_dtawjiw	0	*	She sounds like a proper cunt but they tried to match that by pursuing the name calling. European standards are fucked when it comes to free speech.
t1_dtaxg5n	1	*	I expect this lady's complaint was more that she wasn't being addressed as Madam because she's a fucking pretentious hag.
t1_dtaq7e4	1	*	More commonly referred to as economics. 
t1_dtasj9a	1	*	I did some research and it seems like there is an Eternity clause and article 1 can't be amended due to that, but according to Wikipedia it can be clarified.
t1_dt9zz1f	0	*	im aware of compound nouns just... yeah.
t1_dtabii5	0	*	It's just a thick paste. It's not solid is it, because then you wouldnt be able to use it.  Anyway, smaller ones are allowed, you just can't go through with a big one. 
t1_dtao5xv	1	*	I thought the Republican party was in favour of small government? 
t1_dta9j8m	0	*	Right, but *today*, Poland's a fucking embarrassment that the EU is at the end of its patience with. And they put up with *Britain's* shit for 40 years.

t1_dtacuvq	0	*	Why? You can still criticize them... just do it without name calling... is it that hard?
t1_dta0qpm	0	*	For real.  Some of the people I know in those fields would benefit from that immensely...
t1_dta1q6x	0	*	If you call someone a Nazi, and get arrested (by the government's own police force), what will be your punishment?
t1_dta22gn	0	*	So you think the freaking UN, of all things, is the holy, ultimate source of right and wrong? Lol, this is so dumb I don't know what to say
t1_dta9kve	0	*	What's your point?  There are plenty of right-wing Jews.  
t1_dt9yup0	1	*	Its cool I think we all get a little too sensitive sometimes (and Ive done more than my share of asshattery over the years).  
t1_dt9zcb2	0	*	Criminology was BA for me at my school, totally useless degree no one would need.
t1_dta0hl4	1	*	I just had to reply because I'm Australian, and right now I'm on a train from Salzburg to Munich.

t1_dtaqx29	0	*	Then stay away if you are that dumb.
t1_dt9xa34	1	*	I think it depends on the nature of the joke. I'd be much more offended of someone calling me a Nazi for my German heritage than having someone make fun of my southern accent. 
t1_dtb3jhy	1	*	I stand corrected, thank you
t1_dtb8im1	0	*	No, can you provide me on concrete example of an instance that  demonstrates that  > The liberal left in America calls anyone who isn't a full blown communist a Nazi.
t1_dta4ztx	0	*	In the past year or so, I've seen this particular mistake happen very frequently. People seem to just put an apostrophe on every plural that ends in s despite it being wrong every single time.
t1_dta1w84	0	*	I'm just going to go ahead and call you a liar and be done with you
t1_dtb7h4f	1	*	That's pretty nutty. 
t1_dt9zy0s	0	*	Not bullshit. Check my posting times, I live in America.
t1_dtapvgl	1	*	Actually some laws are older then the Republic of Germany (for example the death penalty in the state of Hessia). And some even pre-date the Third Reich...

t1_dta1wp6	0	*	I'm simply pointing out its not a strictly Nazi thing. However, I agree that they are trying to emulate the originals from WWII.

t1_dtabxw1	0	*	Yeah I'm not sure if I would vote for or against it either. I see your side, but I also think there should be repercussions for saying vile things. 
t1_dta5c3f	1	*	Im Australian. Our two major parties would be considered left around the world. Sjw types, and the Democrats running on their identity politics platform are far left. M8

t1_dt9yua2	1	*	I've popped in a few tarts after too many beer flavoured things. Thankfully tho, I'm somehow not a father.

t1_dur25mz	0	*	That's because you define socialism by it being corrupt.
t1_dur92xx	0	*	China seems to be doing all right.  EDIT: Yes I get it, they've been doing well because they've started integrating capitalist ideals into a state that was previously 100% Marxist.

t1_durbygo	1	*	>Are you intentionally being obtuse?  You're challenging his deeply held beliefs.  Millions of people could literally starve to death in Venezuela, and he would find something else to blame.

t1_dur1puk	0	*	You are correct. Finland and Denmark are both capitalist welfare states. I don't know why so many Americans think we're socialist.
t1_dure7a1	0	*	Venezuela is done so. They're waiting for the US to intervene and they're not going to. Europe is not going to help them.
t1_dus66j7	0	*	Please tell me you play world of warships.
t1_dure4g0	1	*	We let whatever will happen, happen. A people cannot be freed unless they free themselves. Otherwise they will become the spiritual charges of whoever does it for them, and it won't lead to anything.

t1_duracjt	0	*	There was no context, only bullshit and lies.

t1_duw3ioy	0	*	Tell me about these genocidal dictators who the US sent troops and armour to fight for?
t1_dur96if	0	*	Remove all guns is the only way to totally prevent school shootings. Which is unacceptable. Next best thing is to have armed school officials that are on campus every day. Teachers included. 
t1_durivc4	0	*	But inflation affects poor people the most.
t1_dur5sty	1	*	Thanks for that.   Edit 1: Reddit should automatically add a multiple to upvotes on posts that link to evidence from peer reviewed journals. Might improve the discussion.

t1_dur44d2	0	*	We don't need women walking in burkas and we don't need women walking in bikinis and posing on covers in bikinis. This is the case for almost everything. Extremes don't work for humans.

t1_dsgiako	0	*	at least that's what she claims.  I can't seem to find any information corroborating the story.  I'm sure she'd be 100% truthful though. I can't imagine any reason to lie about something like that.

t1_dsp3to6	0	*	Got any of that?

t1_dsns725	1	*	Sure, you can go down that rabbit hole. Its all just our perception of electromagnetic radiation...bla bla bla. Nothing really matters (anyone can see). Nothing really matters (tooooo meeeeee)
t1_dts3h25	1	*	I heard people say that the Quxe9bec accent is basically the Picardy accent from about 300 years ago.
t1_dtrpk8e	0	*	You guys don't have a sense of humour ... I wonder if there is a word to describe a generalization on a group of people to make them look like inferior ...
t1_dtln9uj	0	*	Problem lies in the inherent racism of getting a permit, Israelis can get permits, palestinians get theirs denied 90%+ of times. It makes this legality counter arguement alot less valid.
t1_dtljoeo	0	*	Um, okay? If you know what I'm doing, you probably also know what I think you should shove inside yourself right now.
t1_dtmaw0g	1	*	How does your statement disprove his. If a region was named Palestine for thousands of years and the people who lived there are named Palestinians than what is your point?
t1_dtl65va	1	*	lmao  some real bad posts in this thread
t1_dtmeue2	0	*	Fair enough. I never asked u to reply any of ur comments. Stop replying. Take care.
t1_du794yd	0	*	That's how I feel about gun laws too. A lot of them are for show and make no sense. You can't prevent criminals from committing crimes. They will always find a way.
t1_du7bos8	0	*	Or you're full of crap.

t1_du7efxi	0	*	What do you think would follow annexation of the West Bank?
t1_du7q3v9	0	*	As do the Arabs that were forced out the same. The Jews weren't the majority for thousands of years.

t1_du7ej8a	0	*	So did I enlighten you? 
t1_du7hslo	0	*	God gave it to the Jews. See Genesis 12 and 15.   Everyone else just stole it for a little while. Now, the rightful people own it again. Does that make you mad?

t1_du7bwvz	0	*	Israeli PR is really good to make up for an immoral Apartheid country.

t1_du7ft0y	0	*	Well, we did do 90% of that genocide with accidental biological warfare in the century before anyone started shooting the decimated remnants.   Oops! Did I just smallpox blanket you?! My bad!

t1_du7jjzr	0	*	If the Israeli government holding power holds that line of reasoning then it is relevant. Since they do it should be condemned instead of you providing an apologists excuse. 
t1_du7kzaw	0	*	I said it's not internationally recognised. You called those people evil. Nobody said anything about destroying Israel.   Syria is not on the UN human rights council. 
t1_du7ckiq	0	*	Israel builds homes on settlements on illegally occupied land pretty much every single year. That's an illegal land grab and it's been happening continuously for ever 50 years. Keep making shit up.
t1_du8cp01	0	*	> There is much more than that.  Ends comment. Damn what a cliffhanger! Maybe we can tune in to season 2 of your comment to find out exactly *what* much more than that refers to.

t1_du77de4	0	*	Did an illegal take your job?
t1_du7hux0	0	*	That certainly painting with broad strokes.  I guess that's pretty easy to do when you paint with a bunch of straw.
t1_du7jq0p	0	*	The Sabbath just sounds like god saying you can't do stuff because fuck you, this is from an outside perspective.
t1_du7lu0k	1	*	Sounds familiar

t1_du7ccjo	1	*	>Why is there anyone left?  Is this a joke, or are you just delusional? Over 500 villages/towns were depopulated. There *is* no one left.
t1_du7qake	0	*	Yeah. Everywhere. That's why you still see Jews openly gassed in US streets while others look on uncaringly.   What you said is not even remotely true in the modern world.
t1_du7buyv	0	*	Israel's own documentation says otherwise, but tell yourself whatever you need to to absolve yourself of the guilt. 
t1_du7r6zj	0	*	All three Abrahamic faiths have legitimate claims to the city, it should be the common heritage of all mankind, not the property of this state or that.
t1_du7gxqa	1	*	> Trump's been found to be innocent of any wrongdoing thus far  He hasn't been found to be innocent of anything. He's still under investigation and they're only piling up. 
t1_du7je45	1	*	Of course, but there's a huge difference between self-defense and revenge. You can argue that Israelis are acting out of revenge, but it's always the Palestinians who fire rockets first. 
t1_du7bx6d	1	*	I think creating a never ending cycle of violence is way better IMO.
t1_du7qxoy	0	*	> The whole purpose of Israel as a Jewish state is so that there's one place where all jews are guaranteed not to be mistreated.  So they solved the problem by becoming the problem for someone else?

t1_du9e6q7	1	*	Are you at war or are you not?  If you are, their rockets are fine, if you're not, your response in Gaza is a war crime.  Which one is it?
t1_du7fkzh	0	*	There may be historical precedent but Genghis Khan should not be a role model for any modern nation-state. These days, we rightly condemn armies that engage in blatant conquest and plunder.
t1_du7bsll	0	*	Israel has no qualms with killing civilians. 
t1_du8yldy	1	*	But settlement is preventing a true two state solution, and pushing them towards a one-state solution...  Assuming they can't sustain this horribly unstable status quo indefinitely, that is...
t1_duaahdf	0	*	No need to live in harmony, but human rights should be guaranteed.
t1_du7pli6	1	*	I have a shockingly similar story to yours, I also use it as a tool to show how calm, calculated discourse can have incredibly positive results
t1_du7r7id	1	*	Someday.
t1_du80dez	0	*	And the Patriot Act? Whats is your response on that? And my original point still stands. She was happy to be friends with Trump and Weinstein until it was no longer politically convienent
t1_du79n4f	1	*	I was banned for *concern trolling* because I mentioned how they silence dissenting voices.  The irony is rich
t1_du7t4k3	1	*	On which part?  For all of it, I suggest you listen to Dan Bonginos podcast.
t1_du8jvy7	1	*	Sounds like a poor Trump voter. 
t1_du8jpcj	1	*	One side has supporters that want to wipe Israel off the map the other side believes that they Palestine never has, will, or deserves to  exist on a map.

t1_du7t04p	0	*	If you're slaughtering that many kids then you're in the wrong and it's unbelievable that anyone can argue otherwise. 
t1_du7n1ti	1	*	My religious beliefs can be summed up as  I don't know and I am open to any possibility.  I wouldn't call it closely held. 
t1_dsfo0iv	1	*	Why does one have to be a nihilist to be an atheist?  
t1_dsgmyk0	0	*	I'm actually bringing food on people's table. God doesn't exist and therefore brings nobody any food.

t1_dshhnue	1	*	So bisexuality is still cool then?  ...wait, all the creatures in the world? Does that mean animals and plants are ok?
t1_dsfcfwe	1	*	oh... you're right. What he said is just such a wrong characterization of what panspermia actually is that I didn't recognize the idea.
t1_duvww8h	0	*	In which direction?
t1_duwfvkk	1	*	I'm sure that once it becomes clear that Brexit was a bad idea the Brexiters are going to find a way to blame the EU for it.
t1_dt4tsry	0	*	or just have the local PD have someone on patrol there.. 
t1_du0de28	1	*	Soooooooo...you are too scared to say no?

t1_ds8kmie	1	*	There's nothing stupid in my statements. Just harsh truths.  
t1_ds857ug	0	*	No that's not at all what I meant.

t1_ds91am6	1	*	I disagree with the extent of westernisation you keep ascribing to Iran but I agree with your overall point. Real change would have been possible if it wasn't for the CIA backed coup earlier on
t1_dsbbqih	1	*	No, I said no such thing. Only that the US supplied Iran with weapons during the Iran/Iraq war.

t1_dt4crg6	0	*	You just dont have an answer to my question. 
t1_dt5wymm	0	*	Trump is a fooking moron, a con artist, and Putin's useful idiot.   General Mattis is probably motivated by a desire to minimize the damage caused by the Russian Puppet Trump.
t1_dt4uaw1	0	*	I like how /u/beanzamillion21 responded so aggressively to your last link, then ignored this one because it shut his argument down.

t1_dsd5gtj	0	*	I guess we should all just pull ourselves up by our bootstraps and try enjoying our shitty work.
t1_dsd5s9m	0	*	That's not true at all. There would be work without corporations. Ever heard of Co-ops? Soviet Union didn't have corporations, yet people still worked.
t1_dsd8k2f	1	*	Oh absolutely. I worded that badly: the opposite extreme is just as bad.
t1_dsd4vtu	1	*	Systematic abuse hidden in one of the local institutions.

t1_dsd223m	1	*	Show us on the teddy where the bad man touched you.

t1_dscrttp	0	*	Or shut the damn door, you're letting the snow in and the heat out.

t1_durqntf	0	*	Denying the reality of others' free agency might be easier than admitting your politics are on the fringe, but it doesn't constitute proof of social-engineering conspiracy.
t1_durr93l	0	*	Yeah i dunno if my comments were misconstrued as arguementative but I was just shocked so much debt is tied into vaccines. It's mind blowing 
t1_dur1agy	0	*	Ignoratio elenchi; the fact that a random person is complaining is not the takeaway here.
t1_duykxlv	0	*	First it's spelled propaganda and second, why are liberals always so interested in gay sex? Is it your massive daily soy intake?
t1_duyqcjl	0	*	I'm saying like it doesn't matter in the context of Russian collusion to steal an election. Because it affirmatively does not. 
t1_duyvimc	1	*	I mean if he was just doing it to spite Obama then its just gross. If he's in the corner jacking off with whatever dropped into a puddle on the floor then I think we've got something 
t1_duyrd4p	0	*	Still you are assuming he needed money from Russians to campaign when he has the cash himself
t1_duz5j4p	0	*	Or they lied for a million other hypothetical reasons. But whatever you say. 
t1_duymo9b	1	*	Funny you should say this is the case, but one of Clinton's core arguments was that all that money from banks influenced her judgement not one bit.
t1_duyoo43	0	*	Are people like you going to burn shit down again when Trump gets re-elected? Serious question. What are you gonna do if he get's re-elected?
t1_duyw4qk	1	*	That's one of my favorite scenes in the whole series.   You know, these actually don't sound that funny one after another. But he does deserve it though

t1_duyl7fb	0	*	I dont know. He would have a significant opposition in the GOP. I think he would still own an election but there would still be some strong opposition on the right.
t1_duysgoi	1	*	Exactly. The choice was still clear, even if it may have felt unpalatable.
t1_duypi44	0	*	I didn't mean any malice, just a joke that wasn't really even directed at you. Maybe you're a bit sensitive? Maybe it was just a misunderstanding. 
t1_duz3rri	1	*	FWIW I think you're right, and I'm also someone who finds Hillary unlikable.  I wonder how much of that is due to the right wing attacks.

t1_duynhhx	1	*	Campaign slogan for #Trump2020? 
t1_duz3b8j	0	*	How exactly is that fired for lying?  Can you just be honest, for once?
t1_duyz2zz	1	*	I liked the one about gynecologists showing their love for women.
t1_dv3dw0n	1	*	No need to apologize to me mate,  I'll leave your to your Kool-aid. 
t1_duz13r8	0	*	Right wingers did this? https://youtu.be/9gtfizIbBDI
t1_duyqh23	0	*	Incessantly trolling my comment with baseless projection isn't exactly supporting your own party's case.  However your envy is both noted and appreciated.  Take care, princess.  
t1_dv10evb	1	*	Yes that's the one!     
t1_duyrg79	0	*	Then why are you talking?
t1_duyl9vn	0	*	And they chose to punish the rest of America. So why not punish them?
t1_duypvur	0	*	Come on Left Wing fake news, he obviously meant 'juice'! Are we going to start labeling our leaders as anti-semitic just because of a simple typo?
t1_duyj2f4	0	*	> Why are you so offended? Are you Russian?  
t1_duywqth	1	*	I mean, he's 73 and prefers working away from the limelight.
t1_duyy2ic	0	*	Why would he spent Russia money when it would break the law?  Anyway let's bring up Hillary clinton's Saudi money, why isn't she being charged?
t1_duz35jd	0	*	The fact that we're arguing about it (as opposed to easily agreeing that he has dementia) is evidence that he's hiding it pretty well (or that there isn't an issue at all). 
t1_duz1pj2	1	*	You're breaking the illusion? Who said you could have a rational approach?
t1_duz34fa	0	*	> We dont have actual evidence of fake news 90% of the time they claim fake news.  No you dont.
t1_duyod8m	0	*	Lol. The guy said the 1980s called and they want their foreign policy back as it relates to Russia? The guy who apparently had this all go down under his watch? 
t1_duzafid	1	*	Immediately after the shoe was thrown, GWB gave the most eloquent unrehearsed speech of his term as POTUS. I don't have a link to it, but hopefully someone will add it.
t1_duyxggy	0	*	Just admit youre wrong and be the bigger person lol
t1_duz4dzt	1	*	Shoe me once, shoe's on you. Shoe me twice, I'm keepin those shoes!
t1_duzsvc1	0	*	You know it was released by Congress, right?
t1_duyzcin	0	*	Lmao that's what you linked as your reasoning.
t1_duyp4k9	0	*	Trump might actually be suffering from dementia, but relying on pence seems poet silly doesn't it
t1_duynagd	1	*	You said we are good at imagining fake things. I want to gauge your relationship to reality.  So how about it? 
t1_duyof33	0	*	That wasn't even an argument lol. I said I can't wait til we see the app. Then we'll see how big of a role the dossier played once and for all. 
t1_duzl4pl	1	*	Clearly, he meddled....
t1_duyugv6	0	*	Only people invested in your conspiracy theory cares.
t1_duzvu95	1	*	Is there a gif?
t1_duzyq8y	1	*	So it could be that he's actually a linguistic genius that has perfected the filler:specifics ratio to be able to convince people of anything while sounding like absolute nonsense?
t1_duyzy14	0	*	[His](http://www.technovelgy.com/graphics/bladerunner-eyes.jpg) patients.
t1_duz7cra	1	*	He'd also make a better president. Tinker toys for everyone! 
t1_duz4xli	0	*	Are you trying to imply that I believe in ridiculous conspiracy theories?  The irony coming form a muh Russia leftie is huge.
t1_duynvsi	0	*	I dunno, but I think you owe me $100.
t1_duyn0qg	1	*	No problem amigo! U0001f642
t1_duz0bs4	1	*	> Yeah, like Trump is going to start reading. ~~these after he leaves office.~~  Edited for brevity, still accurate.  
t1_duz2v4z	1	*	No, assuming absolutely nothing.  Again:  >I think you are confused what primary source means.  Just google it my dude.
t1_duzce8w	1	*	I guess we should just add a laugh track and maybe a sad trombone/slide whistle sound whenever this happens to soften the blow every time he does this.  
t1_duyn67q	1	*	It's aggregated from compartmentalized sources. 
t1_duzdsxz	1	*	Hopefully people could tell it was slight sarcasm but your comment will assist the stupid.  You have done a great service.
t1_duyrl00	0	*	The stay behinds were from his father Trump senior, not donald W Trump 
t1_duytf0x	0	*	I'm saying for an investigation to begin in the first place, there's supposed to be an at least somewhat credible allegation of wrongdoing. 
t1_duyu5js	1	*	> When standards are high, and results are measured, childrens do learn.   ... Or does they?
t1_duzm122	1	*	Thank goodness you have commenting online down pat. Because it'd probably all you'll ever be good at. 
t1_duyl2ta	1	*	I agree, there are dozens of them! Dozens!
t1_duylzww	0	*	The evidence of the violation is the classified emails being sent.  It's pretty cute and dry when you look at the law that was violated.  Interestingly enough, it says nothing about intent, either.
t1_duympau	0	*	I accept the primary result.  I disagree with how we got to it.
t1_duyltho	0	*	Well voting machines aren't connected to the internet and are all on closed networks, and they print paper ballots sooo..... None. 
t1_duymlt0	1	*	Ok.  I considered it.
t1_duywgog	1	*	 >Edit: was an Iraqi  No, pretty sure it was a shoe
t1_duzlumc	0	*	So Comey wasnt fired so Trump could stifle the Russian connection investigation? Because thats all we heard for a few months. 
t1_duyusrh	1	*	Trump apparently incriminated himself in regards to Flynn getting fired, but as soon as it was clear it was incriminatory his lawyer claimed responsibility for the tweet.
t1_duykyj5	0	*	Since we can't hold Roy Moore accountable for raping children and then decide not to vote for him.  Can we give Hillary the same credit and not holder accountable for your set of vapid conspiracies?
t1_duz2y6i	1	*	That might be more effective than asking any Republicans to do anything about it.
t1_duz03r4	1	*	So you want comment? 2? How many you looking for here?
t1_duyqdln	0	*	Hillary Clinton is a closet Republican?
t1_duylp9e	1	*	Thanks!
t1_duzfuxr	1	*	That's what I was thinking of, thanks!  The Lincoln thing stood out...I was like wait, didn't Trump say This actually?
t1_duzabm4	1	*	I've never called anyone a sweet man.   Well, except for [this guy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willy_Wonka), of course
t1_duym706	1	*	Agreed but tow the line obstructionist republicans hate him. He works with people not against them. Thats not the Greed Over People way
t1_duykutg	1	*	Not an Argument 
t1_duylx75	1	*	If he actually runs then his historic helping lead the march into Iraq would likely come back to bite him in the ass
t1_duysg1o	1	*	Wow. GOP pure scum. 
t1_duz6okb	1	*	So /r for Republican and /R for Russian and /Rr for a Republican politician being cornholed by a Russian.
t1_duyoy4m	1	*	Lmaooooo..cmon my dude. You gotta come harder than that.

t1_duykcxl	1	*	*shakes fist*  Lefties REEE  For what it's worth, I'm left handed but not a lefty.
t1_duykdce	0	*	if any of it actually happened somebody would have come forward long before he ran for president, and the wouldn't have disappeared the second the election was over.     
t1_dv0op95	0	*	Is One Obama?  Your Lord and Savior?
t1_duzab2a	0	*	sounds like he did 
t1_duyk2j8	0	*	Still gotta have willing witnesses. Google for yourself if you don't think rape victims frequently decline to come forward.
t1_duykxlx	0	*	Why do you want an argument? What are you hoping to achieve?
t1_dv0yaqd	0	*	You did not list health care as a right.  Damn straight I consider health care a right, and place it higher in the pantheon of rights than any right to guns.   
t1_duyr5np	0	*	Nobody said he shouldnt be investigated. 
t1_duz2zsz	1	*	>President of American.  he has some great rolemodels in how to speak!

t1_duykbz8	1	*	Not yet, but in 80 years maybe. 
t1_dsz679d	0	*	I wish they wouldn't do that. It's incredibly easy to clone a phone using the same stuff this kid did. 
t1_dsynixv	1	*	This is commented every time the video is posted but I have never seen any evidence for it
t1_dsyccg6	1	*	Oh, I know, but that was the easiest to point to. 
t1_dsyq3po	1	*	The first was a witty subversion and parody of spy movies. The second was just a particularly hamfisted spy movie.
t1_dsycavv	0	*	Bribe him for what? Country was closed off until '92.  Sounds like a fib.
t1_dsz5tzs	1	*	I prefer the TVR scenes but HB topless takes a close second.

t1_dszigzq	0	*	My PTSD is acting up so I'm going to need some reasonable accomodation under the American's with Disabilities Act - so Ill turn in the paper one page at a time in a couple of weeks.

t1_dsye3h7	1	*	And there we have the only reason to watch that movie. Well that and obscure english sports car spotting . Hello TVR!
t1_dsydgki	1	*	Aye, but the only way to stop a bad child of a guy with a gun is a good child of a guy with a gun. In other words, we need to give children access to the world's stockpile of nuclear devices.
t1_dsyd9wk	0	*	Thats literally the only scene I remember. They were in that part of California where Trevor lives... 
t1_dsyr1yv	0	*	Yeah, they had to push it pretty far after CSI (Miami?) created a GUI interface using Visual Basic to see if they could trace an IP address. 
t1_dsz4huk	0	*	Out of curiosity, what made him diagnose you/decide you were on the spectrum after all this time? That seems a tad fishy to me.
t1_dsyp6n2	1	*	That just fucked up my chi!
t1_dsye3nw	0	*	Story please
t1_dsrvifg	0	*	HAHAHAHAHA, how do I know Intels ME was vulnerable? How far out of the loop are you?
t1_dt1k7mz	1	*	In what sense?
t1_dt1lo9s	0	*	You claim DACA is supported by all yet nobody cares about the wall.   Both of these statements are patently false. 
t1_dt1jzg1	0	*	But its not, its entirely the reason.
t1_dt1lf3s	1	*	Which rights? 
t1_dtpen3k	0	*	It's South Florida dude, we got all kinds of people here, no biggie.
t1_ds61lna	1	*	Tell me, what claim does Israel have to any portion of the region of Palestine? 
t1_ds6lian	0	*	Shhhhhhh
t1_ds618pe	0	*	I agree, jews should go back to Europe where they came from 
t1_ds6526o	0	*	OK, I'll concede that the danger to her is non-zero. Did you watch the video?
t1_ds6b3gk	0	*	Israel isnt in a state of war. Its in a state of occupation and colonisation. There is no war.
t1_ds6jp2w	0	*	No I'm referring to Palestinian people.
t1_ds61b40	0	*	Me? I'm Irish and live in Ireland.
t1_dtx539r	0	*	Something like that.  I doubt he'll ever see them again TBH.
t1_dtxdenc	0	*	As an American who regularly browses this sub and was afraid to ask, I have gained through context that it may be a truck or more specifically a type of pickup. But I am not an expert.
t1_dtx7623	1	*	To each their own. I would not want to live in the era, but I do on occasion enjoy a story from a time when the world and society was vastly different from it is today. 
t1_dtx8z7h	1	*	Yup, it's largely talking points, gotchas and strawmanning on here. Barely any good, honest debate.
t1_dtxalxo	1	*	Absolutely, but it does critique by stating a known attitude. That's all that I was referring to. 
t1_dtxsoxl	0	*	It takes two to tango, mate.  Eta:  oh that poor woman...shes such a victim of the big bad politician taking advantage.  *rolls eyes*
t1_dtxbtw6	0	*	Kinda makes me wish I was gay
t1_dtx6mrv	1	*	The complete opposite for me. This was her best novel by far, so much fun to read. 
t1_dtxd7rp	0	*	Between the age of 9-14, women are usually give [two doses.](https://www.gardasil9.com/about-gardasil9/schedule/) Between 15-26, three dosages are administered.

t1_du8twg4	0	*	they have no leverage
t1_du9mr6e	1	*	So why do you think these people died from lack of healthcare? Obviously, their few hospitals are inadequate.
t1_du9i2vv	1	*	I have plenty of empathy. You lack in-group preference. 
t1_du99rvl	0	*	And yet palestine is not its own state is it.  The two state solution didnt go anywhere.  
t1_du8l0ez	0	*	Or hold the Palestinian government, which receives foreign aid, responsible for providing services to Palestinian citizens?
t1_duafj8t	0	*	Im sure the British werent always there 
t1_du8tbca	0	*	Waahhh we lost the war we started but want our land back
t1_du9uxv9	0	*	Seems like the headline should be 54 palestinians die as neighboring countries refuse medical treatment. 
t1_du8ynwo	0	*	Got any evidence? Israel withdrew in 2004
t1_duaivyr	1	*	Google Translate, what have I told you about posting on this page.....
t1_du93fh8	0	*	Its not international waters. You didnt seem aware. 
t1_du9ghxt	1	*	Maybe they're repeating themselves because people keep making the exact same argument thats been refuted thousands of times? 
t1_du9izf9	1	*	I got tired of repeating myself as it was like 7am, so I copy pasted, can you blame me?
t1_du92r6x	0	*	Lmao exactly. The racist shithead who qualifies his evils against Palestine by claiming 'but they're not real!!1!!!1' is an Israeli. Who'd've thunk it.
t1_du9jyl9	0	*	I like your plan. But it should also come with a settlement ban and return of the settlements. 
t1_du8nz47	0	*	You are quoting something that is not written in the link you provided, I do know how to do Ctrl + F you know... but I will give you the benefit of the doubt that you gave me a wrong link.....

t1_du9uwcx	1	*	Go to an Egyptian hospital? 
t1_du93gu3	0	*	What would you suggest?
t1_du8oul4	1	*	It can be argued that Israel occupies the West Bank. But not Gaza.
t1_duhs852	0	*	clearly u havent done any research in what causes cancer /s
t1_dui3yzm	0	*	Right, but did the practice end? I have to say I genuinely don't know. I haven't heard of any legislation that would put an end to it, so  I'm just assuming it didn't.  
t1_duim2g7	1	*	I had no idea this was a possibility; I'll have to look into it deeper.  I've been struggling with this for years, and you may have just offered me a solution!
t1_duiouup	1	*	I don't think the people that are upvoting you and down-voting me realize we are agreeing. Lol

t1_dv5gpk2	0	*	No troll, just calling you for what you put forth. The ignorant among us never realize what they are, so I have no hard feelings, only sympathy.
t1_dtqabl4	1	*	I admit my interest in coal quality ends in SiO2 content of the ash ;)
t1_dtpwkah	1	*	I lived in York for a bit, it's nice but it's like someone grabbed a southern city and dropped it in the north, and the pint prices match southern prices in some places.
t1_dv4uurn	0	*	The Aristocrats 
t1_dv59men	1	*	God help us all
t1_dv558dg	0	*	That that is even possible shows a huge flaw in the two party system. No vote should be a throw-away.
t1_dv4xm4h	0	*	Ok now you're really starting to sound like her. Relax, take a prozac and chill
t1_dv5zmu3	0	*	Lmao. No cuckcake. Subsidiaries don't mean that cnn is literally lying daily like fox news or info wars does. These aren't even comparable levels of misinformation

t1_dv4vkur	0	*	I'm on it, it will be fixed in the next update.
t1_dv55dzd	1	*	There is a difference between an allegation in a newspaper and fact. If the media lies about over feeding Kois then news like this is taken as gossip (at best).
t1_dv56dwp	0	*	And here I thought you were going to post a study to back up the claim. Instead we got a picture.   Great research.
t1_dv5mnkz	0	*	Odin bless him?  Man people need to start worshipping Norse gods more because that sounds badass.

t1_dv4wd3e	1	*	What about the Human Rights Watch? Amnesty International? 
t1_dv51qs3	0	*	It used to mean that. The terms in use in academia now are global north and global south and have more to do with standard of living for an average person.
t1_dv4zovh	1	*	Because 'Merica!
t1_dv4vwqm	0	*	You play as a rich duck trying to get richer... just because.
t1_dv53n8z	0	*	I disagree. Republican voters hardly see the GOP in Congress as conservative enough. Just look at how they fumbled the Obamacare repeal.
t1_dv51ttf	0	*	This is why I included two specific examples of insanity by the Dems, that are happening right now.  I didnt want someone to get the wrong idea of what kind of nonsense I mean.
t1_dv4xqzr	0	*	Kushners Dad != Public Defender 
t1_dv4xt8w	1	*	He never said that she would be worse than Trump. I do believe he's saying that just because Trump is worse, we shouldn't ignore the issues with her.

t1_dv636pv	0	*	My point proven. (Good job not using an insult for once).
t1_dv59kk3	1	*	To which the response should be: so go do it instead of supporting the guy who took advantage of you to do it himself.
t1_dv4z4n6	1	*	To be fair, they *are* hilarious. Its just frightening that its also so important.

t1_dsfdv41	0	*	You are the reason we have the Hollywood abuse scandals coming out now.
t1_dsflr61	1	*	My beliefs are irrelevant. Im not the one pretending that the parties are the same, or that voting trump is somehow centrist or humanitarian. Thats some low effort garbage. 
t1_dsfmk7d	1	*	Are you having trouble with reading comprehension today?
t1_dsfiqtl	1	*	Did you just pull a Dick Cheney? You used your own comment as proof of your own comment.
t1_dsh5ten	1	*	Threatening to jail them? You mean like Obama did?
t1_dsfhb0b	0	*	You are free to think that. But that doesn't change my mind. The murderer and therefore Maduro/Un/Putin/Khameni/etc. is worse.
t1_dsffri2	1	*	Nixon was doing something illegal, it was not classified information
t1_dsfjjcr	0	*	Their oil industry didn't fail. It was a global collapse in OPEC revenue.

t1_dsfjtoq	1	*	>Dude you are trying too hard to justify ranking Trump as no. 1 as some form of non-absurd reasoning.  Be fair... I've not mentioned my opinion about where Trump belongs.  
t1_dsfd7i1	1	*	Im not the one on trial.
t1_dsjqqfu	0	*	What a shocker that someone is support of that ape is using false and flawed equivocation to justify evil in the world. I'm.....shocked.
t1_dsfnqlt	0	*	So you just attack people for having valid complaints and when asked to justify your attacks you deflect instead.  What a brilliant way to approach life.

t1_dtfus4d	0	*	Of course that is democracy and I have to live with the consequences. Did I say otherwise?  I simply pointed out why it doesn't work well.

t1_ds3qv4c	1	*	I'm all for cooperatives. I think it's an idea with potential. The second it becomes involuntary though, it will end the same as it always does.
t1_ds39ivo	1	*	it's only socialism when the economy and state are both democratically controlled by the people.    that's literally the only requirement.

t1_dty9s6b	1	*	Taiwan did take international aid, from a specific group of people who had a specific thing to offer, in this case technology.

t1_dtxvmrh	0	*	If you can prove anything any of us rational people have said is wrong, I will give it to you that we are Chinese wumao shilling on this thread
t1_dty073f	0	*	I never said I like it. I never said I supported it  >but we should not accept them unless their ends justify them.  Exactly. 
t1_du1ekaq	0	*	Chinese wumaos daydreaming about Taiwan invasion while have absolutely no say in real life regarding public policy or CCP military since China is a dictatorship. Keep day dreaming haha.

t1_dtpmabi	1	*	Dont know, we dont have kids yet and Ive never been in the military
t1_du3phq0	1	*	haha yeah- my bad.  not a great place to be forgetful about names.  
t1_dshc42n	0	*	I dont want to pay some taxes. I also like living. Why not find middle ground. There are more choices than be free or die. 
t1_dtbnfjt	0	*	You said Russian boarder (sic). 
t1_dugfw1k	1	*	This is why we have the State Department... Well we used to have a robust State Department who could handle these sort of issues for the benefit of us and our allies. 
t1_dugxtkg	1	*	Of course it's a stupid quote, it came from an American
t1_dugr1jn	0	*	If dropping a bomb on a susceptable Japanese urban civilian center wasn't to kill as many Japanese people as possible, then what was the goal?
t1_duhduc9	1	*	>I don't the intellectual capacity to put up a good counter so I'll just run away now  FTFY  
t1_dugy8tj	1	*	No kidding.  Cooperation: The process of working together to the same end. Assistance, especially by ready compliance with requests.
t1_dugh3gc	1	*	Nice smokescreen.  You're ranting about something that didn't happen.
t1_dugngd2	0	*	>Except there have been tons of creation stories outside of Adam and Eve.  Except that's not at all the point I've made. You're beyond help or rational thought
t1_dug0c41	0	*	Here's who is paying the agreed-upon share to NATO  and who isn't. Sure about that? Did you read?
t1_dujo5kk	0	*	Dang it Russia, get your army out of my capital or I'll write you a strongly worded letter
t1_dujppc7	0	*	I'm all for the USA spending almost a trillion of their own dollars in order to maintain western dominance.
t1_dujo2cg	1	*	Yeah, in the long term.
t1_dujqwl5	1	*	If the US is such a great threat to western culture then why isnt Europe trying to advance the interests of western culture? 
t1_dujw6lt	0	*	If I had to choose between American or Russian hegemony, I'll go American every time. And it's not even a close.
t1_dtqghuf	0	*	Buddy, prohibition ended a century ago. Calling 3 beers a night alcoholism is near Volstead act levels of pearl clutching.  
t1_dtqr4gp	0	*	Not even. One month is enough to drastically reduce my tolerance.
t1_ds93ajy	0	*	You can divide history like that, but why?  How many important events can you remember in the last twenty years, and how many important events can you remember in the 715 to 735 CE years?  
t1_ds8xo7m	0	*	Building settlements isn't a military occupation, that's annexation, conquest, colonization, etc. 
t1_ds8b19m	0	*	why? you can barely comprehend the idea that one sentence that provides the answer to your previous question directly follows the one you were using to continue your obtuse line of shit heeling.  
t1_ds87keu	1	*	Check the link. 
t1_ds9b72d	0	*	Areas surrounded by foreign military that stops the flow of food etc in to it are at fault for no food because they are stopping the flow by putting foreign ships around themselves? 
t1_dsp3i43	0	*	That seems like a great way to lead the US navy right to the drone. Russian subs within a 1000km of CONUS are watched *very closely*. 
t1_dspehji	1	*	Of course this is a friendly call. If it wasnt friendly; why I wouldnt be calling.
t1_dsou10s	0	*	Let me know. Id be very interested in reading more. 
t1_dsov0ga	0	*	Honest question, do you not consider China a legitimate foe when we fought the Korean War?
t1_dsp3eu8	0	*	Cool.  Got anything that says 10M plus?
t1_dsp2ybv	0	*	Not really. The biggest threat is a meteor the size of Texas. 
t1_dsp9m20	1	*	Well it was also a death quote in call of duty 4 lol
t1_dsp37v0	1	*	There was a pretty neat documentary called WarGames about this kind of thing back in the '80s. Still holds pretty true, though it isn't a novel.
t1_dsp3eis	1	*	What if they're speaking politely?
t1_dsp4fsj	0	*	If it's powered by a reactor, it's range is almost limitless. 
t1_dsp3a6m	0	*	People forgot indoor plumbing after the fall of the Roman Empire.
t1_dsowk64	1	*	Id say the Korean War (due to the not so secret fact that we were fighting China moreso than Koreans). 
t1_dsp79z2	1	*	or just colonize enough worlds that we aren't capable of threatening our entire existence in the same way
t1_dsp4ebz	0	*	Have PAK FA and Kalibr been performing poorly in Syria? I didn't even think the fighter was in production.
t1_dsp45uy	0	*	Plus there is a major difference between an intelligence ship and an aircraft carrier.
t1_dsop9b4	0	*	Radioactive clouds probably, dust layer I doubt it. As crazy and terrible H-bombs are they are still farrrrr from this level of destruction.
t1_dsova5c	0	*	The Vietnamese would disagree with you.
t1_dsp87j6	0	*	I believe this is the greatest film ever made. My all time favorite. 
t1_dsp1wvv	0	*	So how many megatons would it take to just completely obliterate earth. Like the atmosphere or whatever. 
t1_dsos89m	0	*	Yeah in your dreams
t1_dsp2emw	0	*	Why couldn't she be the *other* kind of mermaid, with the fish part on top and the lady part on the bottom??
t1_dsp7dkw	1	*	Ocean life is completely fucked too at this point.
t1_dspd155	1	*	Or course if you can do all that you probably don't need to flog some ape planets water 
t1_dsoxa0s	0	*	Yeah i remember something like that too, it was something so fast that was almost impossible to counter
t1_dsp66c3	0	*	No 'nation' won ww2. Everybody lost. And besides it was a war of allies vs allies not one nation vs another.
t1_dsoqofs	0	*	A few hundred or so humans would probably survive. Humans are surprisingly good at surviving, our ancestors did it during other complete global ice ages and things.
t1_dspg1n6	1	*	A Peter Sellars film without him playing at least two disparate roles is considered to be a dull affair.
t1_dsqcbm9	1	*	I saw the needle in the haystack argument. But why not just assign a satellite to it?  Or a series of satellites and aircraft. Seems like something everyone would be working towards. 
t1_dsowxdo	0	*	Do they change every time over time or sometimeas? 
t1_dsp9c6w	0	*	This is basically the event that kicks off the book The Road. We don't want to live in a The Road world.
t1_dsp7prj	0	*	Same applies to the U.S. Which isn't a rich country either and spends all its money on 'stupidly' military expansions.
t1_dsp90k0	1	*	Oliver Stone sat with and made Putin's watch it. Putin's was like, WTF, you waste my time with this? Silly America, be serious like me. 
t1_dsox92b	0	*	Not biblical, old Roman.
t1_dsp570v	0	*	You're worse than edgy
t1_dspcnqt	0	*	Car accidents are accidental, though, not intentional as with nukes.
t1_dsp49j0	0	*	Maybe they get their numbers from Tesla's truck division.

t1_dsp2qwf	0	*	This is not the MAD he was talking about.
t1_dspavj8	1	*	Hitting that many civilians would be suicide for any nation that did it, though. The US wouldn't be the only country retaliating with doomsday-level force at that point.
t1_dsp84b1	1	*	Movie doesn't work.
t1_dsoudwe	0	*	Makes my blood boil, that stupid movie
t1_dsp67ov	0	*	The guys from RAND Corporation whole worked with the Pentagon on nuclear strategy studies went to see Dr. Strangelove when it came out. One remarked to the other Its not a movie - its a documentary!
t1_dsos6x3	0	*	I would assume some lazer bases system, but I know fuck all about this stuff.
t1_dsp6ei5	0	*	we already are under a brave new world capitalist regime...
t1_dsp67p3	1	*	That's a supposed story 
t1_dsp44q4	1	*	Who's pretending?
t1_dspj370	0	*	You need to look at a map.
t1_dsp412a	0	*	Sure - but can't they just track the carrier as it leaves port?  I'd think that that's just something all the potential superpowers do to eachother
t1_dsp60zv	0	*	That would still leave the US with 500-600 nukes in which case you don't even need a 3rd of that arsenal to make Earth uninhabitable.
t1_dsoyvzy	0	*	Looks like I'm wrong. I was misinformed I suppose. Thanks for clarifying. 
t1_dspcidq	0	*	They didn't account for Li-6, when bombarded with neutrons it turns into tritium.
t1_dsp2ub2	1	*	Well you are lucky, since last year there is an actual cash price of ~1.1million $
t1_dsplom5	0	*	Oh.  Those people wouldn't be evacuated, given our understanding of fallout......?
t1_dsp872a	1	*	Somehow I forgot about Alaska (sorry Sarah Palin, I can't see your house from here lol). 
t1_dsp3irr	0	*	Isn't SM3 block IIA hypothetically capable of intercepting in the terminal stage of ICBM type weapons? Not that it would be particularly likely when you have to hit an object moving Mach 12
t1_dsp699n	0	*	again you are the problem as much as them.
t1_dsqdlpa	1	*	technically, my original comment says nicest water planet, which is certainly true
t1_dsp8jvk	1	*	That's pretty uncool man.
t1_dsp5mhq	0	*	  ***redacted*** *
t1_dspcn1s	0	*	MAD strikes again 
t1_dsuj7e3	0	*	Yes possibly but as mentioned radio waves dont travel well in water, so what if the drone just accidently didnt get the signal
t1_dsp9mgq	1	*	Yeah i edited my comment a bit
t1_dsp6o5r	1	*	I'll only miss people because the internet won't work
t1_dspj21h	1	*	In the middle of the ocean pretty much no one.
t1_dspa8tw	1	*	My favourite quote is still. Gentlemen, you can't fight in here! This is the War Room!
t1_dspa1sq	1	*	Kinda like how nukes dont start wars, countries do?  Imagine how much more safe we would be if every country had nukes! 
t1_dspp5h4	1	*	The line  Gentleman, you can't fight in here, this is the war room! Was always my favorite
t1_dspsysk	1	*	This is the USSR, they were so poor they had import light bulbs from Finland. 
t1_dsp3xrp	1	*	We've just done proxy wars instead.  Which mirror the geopolitical effect of a pre-industrial war far better than the bloodbaths of total war.  
t1_dsp1h8z	0	*	> People wrote about it at the time.  [Citation needed]   Nukes are pretty clearly on a different level to machine guns. Machine guns are not civilisation ending weapons.
t1_dsp8tru	1	*	Eugenics war.
t1_dsplpvt	1	*	Feel free to refute me with a source other than internet-armchair-analytics
t1_dstjexf	1	*	This is utter bullshit.  The Russians pulled out.  The Americans went in.  Who is currently doing the fucking?
t1_dsop3au	0	*	MAD is already working since 70 years.
t1_dsp9xso	1	*	Slept with their wives and kicked their dogs too.
t1_dsp7p65	0	*	I found this site while I was looking stuff up. It shows you all of the effects of a nuclear explosion, the Tsar bomb is one of the preset options. Its insane.  http://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/
t1_dspk4r2	0	*	I think at some point it just became about sending a message, why else build a bomb that vents part of its explosive energy into space? (The Tsar bomba supposedly had energy losses due to this)
t1_dspo06b	0	*	Because that was the subtitle of the movie. [Here's one of the posters.](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/72/b3/ca/72b3ca75c7c3f66db06340fff59de55b.jpg)
t1_dspk3wt	1	*	They are still effective. Dry potassium iodide is very stable. They only protect you from thyroid cancer though. Although thyroid cancer was the most common cancer in Belarus after Tschernobyl. 
t1_dsp2cjj	1	*	A single inbound missile would mean a retaliation to every major city from whichever country it launched from, without fail imo 
t1_dtu4bgl	0	*	Nope.  In order to quickly find it, it will have a beacon of a radio signal. All power goes to that.
t1_dssxwhm	1	*	What Kim thinks of a Trump tweet isn't exactly news. He will never have anything nice to say. 
t1_dsrxd4k	1	*	Im talking about the damage theyre actually causing; I dont care for hypotheticals. Under the right circumstances we can all turn into monsters.
t1_dsrrl6m	0	*	What? The beginning of the year was two weeks ago! Lol
t1_dsrnfbc	0	*	Check the front page

t1_dsrvhye	0	*	And yours are too closely connected for this to be a coincidence 
t1_dsrnj1e	0	*	You misspelled murdered. The Soviets beat the Nazis. 
t1_dsrw2q2	0	*	You have the exact, *the exact* same people on the side of the left too. Theyre called fanatics and pretty much every popular person has a following or them.
t1_dss0cpv	0	*	> What's the point.  That we should hold businesses accountable for working with oppressive despots?
t1_dsrvdxd	0	*	>How is providing a service that will mostly be used by students evil?  Ask your Ritalin dealer.
t1_dsrr0si	0	*	The tweets dont equal a sociopath. Trump doesnt display extreme antisocial behavior either ....? 
t1_dssox97	0	*	No, Twitter posturing does not do this. NK knows we will outgun them at every turn; everyone knows this. Responding like Trump did just gave them credibility. 
t1_dsrvdj0	0	*	How exactly does one tell the difference? Voluntary ejection from a functioning aircraft versus emergency ejection from a damaged one?
t1_dss1do0	0	*	He did, actually.
t1_dsrv5ga	0	*	What? The immigration ban is in effect right now and the wall is in prototype stage

t1_dsrtv16	0	*	Glad your conscience is okay with dictatorships. So long as they only torture, starve, rape and kill their own right?
t1_dsrn6m3	0	*	I^can^make^my^words^smaller^too
t1_dsrvmv4	0	*	Porn. It's the only thing Bing is good for. Basically Google filters so much shit out, even if you have safe search turned off. Bing doesn't do that though.
t1_dss5x0y	0	*	Go ahead and look at my comment history from the past hour or two.   That's what happens when a person provides sources that conflict with indoctrination.  There's no point.
t1_dss6r5z	0	*	I've always loved this one :)  In all seriousness, it was the Huron word for settlement (Kanata) and Jacques Cartier misunderstood.
t1_dsrxjaz	0	*	I called him a bear. You took that as a defense of him because you choose to see you people defending him. 
t1_dssdkcm	0	*	They earned them enough time to build nuclear weapons.
t1_dsruj31	1	*	It's almost like 99% of the North Korean population *aren't* part of the evil regime which controls everything!
t1_dsrrah7	1	*	This is all Trump fans have left to say. Words don't matter...lol...what an amazing time to be alive. 
t1_dss2cor	0	*	Pretending it's a docile butterfly doesn't work though, we have tried that for *years*. 
t1_dsrqtk3	0	*	What happened, /u/DarthJordan ?? I thought you tough guys liked red pill truths. Worried you'll get banned from your fellow centipedos at the Donald for admitting you were wrong? Sad!!
t1_dsro10k	0	*	Whered you get that info? I think hes alright. I mean I think hes doing better than some people at least. Pretty sure the economy is doing better now.

t1_dssctk5	0	*	He was Obama's doctor too
t1_dss69f2	0	*	LOL don't call Trump my great leader. I'm not a Trump supporter. I'm just sick of the fools running around crying wolf all damn day. I'm as liberal as they come, baby.
t1_dsrxfvy	1	*	Haha pussy
t1_dsro80m	0	*	You mean a return to the cold war.
t1_dsrq8g7	1	*	Just log off of reddit and go outside, being that obsessed with anything isnt healthy. 
t1_dssar2d	1	*	If you make 40K you're getting about $600 more dollars a year which is guaranteed to be less money than health insurance prices will rise without the individual mandate.

t1_dsrttv8	1	*	You have gone off the deep end. Be safe in your sky castles. 
t1_dsrtg6d	0	*	And they surrendered within days after the use. We have the luxury of Monday morning quarterbacking events of the war, doesnt make the use any worse either. War is shitty. 
t1_dsrpyk9	0	*	What did he do wrong? Can you tell me some of these thing America does that parallels with North Korea?
t1_dsrkl9f	0	*	There we go
t1_dsro1s7	0	*	At some point you typed these words and thought this is a good comment and hit post.  You should rethink doing that next time.
t1_dsrylim	1	*	Webster says affected with a severely disordered state of mind : insane but I am no doctor.
t1_dsrr2k2	0	*	Deletion? Driving a wedge? Lmao what are you talking about ya delusional fuck. Pointing out broken English misusing key words throat and slice is none of the above. Sorry for causing your anguish. 
t1_dsszj6o	0	*	Because you're too dense. 
t1_dss1m1a	1	*	I iron shirts all the time. At home, in the washroom, in my car, in the forest,  hell sometimes even in public!
t1_dsrolka	0	*	Koreans aren't a country, South Korea is our ally, North Korea constantly threatens South Korea so we defend South Korea from their aggression.
t1_dsrvzxg	0	*	you really are in your own little fantasy huh?
t1_dsrv9zc	0	*	You can't judge Republicans by their *actions!*  You need to judge them by what they say, not what they do!

t1_dss2aqh	0	*	Lol you still need money 
t1_dsrpttv	1	*	No you stated a tangentially related fact with no argument or anything
t1_dsst1qs	1	*	You think there should be a firm hand?  I don't agree, but fine.  Saying schoolyard shit like My button is bigger on Twitter isn't the right way to do it.
t1_dsrw4vj	0	*	thats... incredible

t1_dsl99lj	0	*	It's ok if you can't read comprehensively, you don't need to go and make things up, you can just say I'm dumb and everybody understands :)

t1_dsmnkk8	1	*	Valid point

t1_dsky937	0	*	The ratio of left/right on Reddit is pretty far off, and calling everyone alt right is about as meaningless as saying things like grade-school subjects are racist.

t1_dslflj2	1	*	You just said online gambling was the reason for the downfall..now you can't make the connection? Please tell me you're joking, or I missed the context of this.
t1_dsl6eyb	0	*	Well-being of a country's population is inseparable from it's profitability (as a whole). States are effectively run similar to large corporations (and vice versa).
t1_dsl745z	0	*	I do too. Rewatching the video I can't help but feel like Obama fell into the same trap that Reagan did; he assumed Americans were better people than we actually are.
t1_dslpj3p	0	*	Corruption's got nothing to do with it. A managed and orderly decrease in population will result in a shortage of consumers to buy things. This kills the economy. You do *not* want that to happen.
t1_dskzof3	0	*	Not really.  Everyone can just agree it was an unlawful order.  Unlawful orders don't need to be followed.
t1_dsl5ug7	0	*	I love Obama :( he completely paid for my college tuition because I was in engineering. Miss you bro :'( 
t1_dslaom7	0	*	Well it's at least undeniable that something to do with the presidency has a huge affect on the markets.
t1_dskz9ps	0	*	If 500 billion fucking dollars in revenue isn't good enough for you then I don't know what to tell you. Walmart is one of the most successful corporations in human history.
t1_dsl7h1e	1	*	In the context of the speech, he was referring to those entering illegally, not the entire population. I do grant you it was an uncouth statement, though.
t1_dsl298v	0	*	I've heard stories of some of the advisors and chief of staff in the WH having a protocol in place to stop him if he ever tries to activate the football

t1_dsl7woa	0	*	Well, not completely. But it might be that some of us Europeans knew of him because of Ivana Trump. They were in many tabloids, like the princess and the frog (who stayed frog).
t1_dslbq26	0	*	Lol! You forgot the /s, someone could think you were serious.
t1_dsl2xzd	1	*	I mean, none of the wars we've been in for the last 30-40 years have been legal. All's fair in love and war for America, I guess.

t1_dsl3xhg	0	*	It boggles my mind that the same media apparatus which launched a smear campaign against Obama being 'unpresidential' has remade itself into an all-purpose knob polisher for Trump.
t1_dslb9pa	0	*	Clearly that's wrong too since America isn't a democracy and Trump also lost the popular vote by several million

t1_dua5sn1	0	*	Fine, then change the law so that police have a legal obligation to protect you and can respond withing 60 seconds. Until then, fuck off
t1_dua5zhu	0	*	Alright let me get rid of my fire extinguisher because of the low chance of a house fire.

t1_dua5wf3	1	*	Thanks for clarification.
t1_dua5hat	1	*	You can put a large magazine into any rifle or handgun. It's not a feature of an individual model.

t1_dtb41hq	0	*	Hey I'm OK with you Americans have the weird pride of insisting flushing TPs down your toilets but saying your piss don't smell is fucking retarded.
t1_dscdtw0	0	*	Yes it is. 
t1_dscplwv	0	*	No, both sides of the conflict in Charlottesville. And again, he said that there were **good** people on both sides, so there you go. Thats him defending neo-Nazis. 
t1_dscx0l9	1	*	Thus we should throw both Islamists and alt-right cancer out. Simple.
t1_dscj1y7	0	*	No, in modern times in a competent L&D ward, you would have been given terbutaline to stop the contractions.   Source: had an emergency C-section after 10 hours of labor. Which saved my childs life. 
t1_dsdnq8f	1	*	So you still didn't read anything? She was serious, in the story that I heard wrong. Read before you comment
t1_dscjc4q	0	*	There are weird philipino Nazis, it's a very clear in general thing but pretty muddled in the details 
t1_dsctjrg	0	*	alt-right was coined by neo-nazi Richard Spencer as a way of rebranding Nazism to make it more palatable.
t1_dscaegz	0	*	I know that it's just a PR account, my question still stands: Who follows an account full of pictures of a dolled up 5 year old?
t1_dscmf96	1	*	We think theyre sculpted by the womb and the flow of amniotic fluid, so each is unique.
t1_dsdkpyj	0	*	The removal of the statue has absolutely nothing to do with free speech. Nothing. So calling it the free speech side is just absurd. 
t1_dsbw6rs	0	*	i can see why they would be confused though since turkey has attempted to join the European Union

t1_dscbylw	0	*	I really don't think most people would care if, say, white immigrants to Japan or Turkey ended up having children, but whatever fits your racist narrative.

t1_dscfyqb	0	*	but objectively following the book, it's very similar to nazism

t1_dsco239	1	*	What on earth does your example even mean?
t1_dsc6dg7	0	*	Yeah, but so many people who are critics of political islam are just racist who use it as cover because they really hate arabs.
t1_dscbucp	1	*	And depending on their country they either hide that fact, hide themselves, get death threats for apostasy, or get killed for apostasy
t1_dsbw8n9	0	*	hahahaha ok go hang out in saudi arabia then. wow people love to lie to themselves about the brutalities of islam

t1_dsc09hu	0	*	It doesn't. Making the online harassment even worse. But I'm willing to bet the beliefs will be imposed by the parents. That's how all religions work
t1_dsc6ig5	0	*	I bet if I said something like That's so America you'd be okay. 
t1_dscn7q8	1	*	i never commented on race. try to pay attention.   i'm just noting the cultural changes that could result from uncontrolled migration and non existent immigration policy. 
t1_dsbvwpx	0	*	No, these situations are nothing alike. Jews werent coming in, they were in Europe since the Roman times and Judaism was never an expansionist like Islam is. 
t1_dschatm	0	*	I think the argument being made is that the American public expressed that opinion. 
t1_dscj2dl	0	*	Can you even imagine how much rape there would be if the percentage of white and Muslim men were switched?

t1_dsca0qk	0	*	Was about to say that
t1_dscl0aw	1	*	Fair point.
t1_dsccjva	1	*	It's still **considerably** safer than the racist parts of the US, for what it's worth. Safer than the US in general, too.
t1_dscvvkf	0	*	Why do you consider it is a bad thing? And why do you think the flow of immigrants will be constant?
t1_dsd4q3b	0	*	Migration is a privilege?  Holy fuck you would think theres some sort of socio-political system designed to tell people where they can and cant live based on race

t1_dscxc3s	0	*	They would be classified as *tourists*, not immigrants.  Theres a difference.
t1_dsc7sgh	0	*	Um, no. The can freely leave Austria with no problems afaik but black people in the 50s would have a much much harder time and they probably didnt choose to be there either. Try again.
t1_dscbpwo	1	*	I'm actually a low German like you
t1_dsclb7r	1	*	Crazy
t1_dscg94h	1	*	Yes it is
t1_dsc53wk	1	*	He probably just googled Sudan and posted the first link supporting his argument. I bet he can't even find it on a map.
t1_dscnrk8	0	*	In my family, there are a lot, and I mean a lot, of kids born in September.  Most every day has a birthday or two.      As my parents phrased it, winters in Iowa are very cold.
t1_dsca3y5	0	*	Well, in theory LSD is harmless, but sometimes it's either laced or the recipe was gotten wrong, so you still have to be somewhat careful.
t1_dscj6fj	0	*	I refer to them as such from time to time. Although in the grand scheme of things Bravo is a bit more assertive than Alpha.
t1_dsce0rl	1	*	By that standard, then, there has *never* been a genocide in the EU, as it has only existed since 1993, when the Maastricht Treaty was signed.

t1_dscg6a9	0	*	I have no idea why I would need to defend anything given that I didn't bring skin color into this. Germany is not the US, I have no interest to debate that nonsense. 
t1_dsccogg	0	*	Yeah, I'm fairly right wing and think Muslims are generally fucked for their beliefs, and my friends are always surprised when I defend natives. 
t1_dscq6ro	1	*	I guess I should've specified identical twins.  They look alike, and are often called by their sibling's name often enough to just accept is as a second name
t1_dsdu0x8	1	*	What country gets 50 million immigrants in a year? I could hardly see most countries having that many in a decade. That's more people than have fled Syria since the start of the civil war

t1_dsby4d5	0	*	You know exactly what i mean and pretending not to is dumb. Xenophobia and racism overlap so thoroughly that they can be mentioned interchangably. 
t1_dsc8z08	0	*	That's kind of scary, and sad. And I'm not even white. Theextinction of any race (or species when it comes to animals) is such an incredible loss to the world.
t1_dsckam6	0	*	He's...not joking...
t1_dsc3d5d	1	*	Trump got elected because nobody really understood before how dumb america really is. Now we know: dumb enough to elect trump.

t1_dtgs1l0	0	*	If you don't suck at shooting you can get a quick kill. If you can't drop it in its tracks you shouldn't shoot it. I've had to let many deer walk away because I didn't have a good angle on it.

t1_duplnf1	0	*	It's mostly to lower the interest rates to try and bolster the economy, inflation is an after effect that is beneficial up to a certain point. Really depends on the central bank's goal. 
t1_dupqi7y	0	*	Like I said, it's inevitable. Those 100 million people are going to be 200 million now or later now matter what we do. Better to be prepared for the next downturn.

t1_dupke02	0	*	Of course, but saying Germany is now extremely dangerous because of some refugees, while violent crime in the US is rampant is just extremely stupid.
t1_dur86y2	1	*	[citation needed]

t1_dugs1lk	1	*	An imaginary animal for a country that isn't a country
t1_dugp55e	1	*	Over 7% of the US internet population uses reddit. Thats pretty huge. And that cancer spread to other sites too
t1_dugvpi0	1	*	You say that, but I would be shocked if before all this is over, some Fox News folks don't end up being implicated in spreading Russian disinformation, even if unwittingly.
t1_duguygy	0	*	How do you know so much about Trump. Are you related?
t1_duhyjo7	1	*	I am assuming there would be an economic downturn in multiple EU countries due to the collapse of the EU, and therefore less gas would be imported during an economic downturn
t1_dugqtl7	1	*	Better drone strikes than US soldiers dying to achieve the same objectives.

t1_dugtry7	1	*	Welcome to democracy. One man = one vote. More men = more votes; less men = less votes.   Basic logic. 
t1_dugytvt	1	*	Because the will of the people = whatever the government decide it is
t1_duguh3n	0	*	2020.  To be sure, people should vote this year as well, in primaries especially, but come 2020 Sanders will wipe the floor with any corporate stooge going for the nomination.
t1_dugxqt1	0	*	Like you said, maybe a strong majority are Democrats, but still millions of Republicans, which is possibly more than some 'red' states.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G3wLQz-LgrM
t1_ds9f3fp	1	*	Lol, ok  I didnt see that you were a different person
t1_duufqiq	0	*	> Islam is not a race or ethnicity, it is a religion  So how do you profile muslims? Except from profiling those who go to the mosque?
t1_dutgzun	1	*	Just try it once then you'll come back for it again and again with self-loathing then you stop giving  a fuck and jack off anyway   _trust me it's not that bad_
t1_duu419k	0	*	They're far from the only Muslim group fighting against people like Daesh, though. There are and have been lots of them.
t1_dtyiz4k	0	*	> I know who fucking Bob Woodward is  And yet you imply you trust human scum like Rumsfeld more than him. I think we are done here.
t1_du62iih	1	*	That is dome, it's all evaped out
t1_dt3101q	1	*	lol I'm not sure if she had a significant personality change from the brain damage or if she learned to be mean from life experience

t1_dtwiyq2	0	*	So you purpose we raise the age of consent to 25? rofl
t1_dtvv5rv	0	*	Nope he had it right. No one is saying that the lives of children don't matter. People just don't like false equivalencies that are intended to be inflammatory. 
t1_dtw5zyg	0	*	Stuff has come out that Bill Clinton is a rapist. Does that make it true? He wasn't convicted and it's allegations but by your logic it is true.
t1_dxenjgx	1	*	Man, I would give you gold if I could
t1_ducsxrv	0	*	Then you should know the majority of US cheese is of abysmal unhealthy quality.

t1_ducl5hu	1	*	Sounds like someone drank too much of the murican kool aid.
t1_duckvs6	1	*	Pollution is a necessary byproduct of industrialization. At least China isn't short sighted like the US, always looking back while the train goes full steam ahead.
t1_ducvr8h	1	*	Years > handing over your company's crown jewels
t1_duc4v79	1	*	I'd say the existence of political dynasties is probably one of the major concerns, the us government is more heriditory than some medieval monarchies were.
