t1_dtc7qql	1	*	There's the problem I guess 
t1_dtbwsrx	0	*	I think it is funny that reddit has an anti-boeing fan club.  Even the fans of competitors like spacex still like boeing.
t1_dtbl0ve	1	*	[If you're really interested](https://www.google.com/) 
t1_dtbb4xv	0	*	That was before airbus bought it.  Now they own like 19%.  And the plane won't be built in canada, so the jobs they tried to protect are gone.  Meaning they got burned big time. 
t1_dtcl7cg	0	*	Your posts in this thread make you sound like a Boeing employee.
t1_dtbb7ek	1	*	Who cares.  Whoever manufacturers it better wins.  That is how high tech companies compete.
t1_dtd1pol	0	*	Why do you keep talking about Boeing fucking up?  It's got nothing to do with that.
t1_dtbm3gq	0	*	The A321neo is pretty much untouched by any 737max jet. We're talking almost 7,000km range and that's not even counting the planned Long Range variant of the A321neo. 
t1_dtbdn03	0	*	ya, that's the bit that had us kinda pissed, the shear hypocrisy of Boeing suggesting unfair government subsidies.
t1_dtb9a20	1	*	Patents can cover process and end product.  But if you patent, it is public.  You keep it a trade secret so no one else knows how to do it.
t1_dtbtybw	1	*	Why is military contracts in quotes?

t1_duclhg3	1	*	there is a difference between invading and annexing you halfwit
t1_dunpfne	1	*	having a counter example doesn't make my claim completely false, and tbh you can avoid tax at all levels by simply not declaring income. I agree with your example but it doesn't negate what I've said.
t1_dumytq6	1	*	Benevolent dictatorship
t1_dumejdb	1	*	Yeah, we don't have enough of it and some groups don't have the resources to effectively lobby for their interests.
t1_dumpti0	0	*	Why are you perceiving fair points distribution based on voting percentage as turning the politics against you? It's just giving a voice to all Californians when it comes to the presidential vote. 
t1_dumntse	1	*	You might very well be right. I'm more just  speaking to my experiences. 
t1_dunexb0	0	*	That doesn't make them corrupt, but they are aiding corruption elsewhere
t1_dun4wws	0	*	Neither are you, and no, it isnt. Thats very clearly an example of raising or prompting a question.
t1_dumd666	1	*	No. At worst it's undemocratic, but not corrupt. Corruption implies that the behaviour is illegal or unlawful, but that is not the case here.

t1_duba5yq	1	*	Sick days aren't a benefit of well paying jobs in the UK, they are a standard for everyone. Though usually unpaid unless salaried. It's also standard to have 1 month of paid annual leave.

t1_dtllf3r	0	*	The program is currently operating outside of the law.  That being said, the government hasn't shut it down, so...
t1_dtliqzj	0	*	Legalizing and regulating drugs makes them far less accessible to children than being able to walk down to the corner and get them unregulated off the street.
t1_dtlku5g	0	*	I think America in general just has a vengeance-boner and general problems with lack of empathy.
t1_dtl652r	0	*	Saliva is very easy to obtain and quick to test, it also only goes back 24 hours. 72 max. So it's a pretty good and easy test for them to use still.
t1_dtlf0oo	1	*	Because getting off of it is much more difficult and you still want the effects of heroin.
t1_dtlv9xp	1	*	Addiction is a disease. If I had cancer you wouldn't give two shits about the government helping me.   
t1_dtljmjc	1	*	Okay, thanks
t1_dtlllx8	0	*	Wouldn't that incentivize getting people hooked on heroin? Just seems like a dangerous road to cross. 
t1_dtmo0lk	0	*	Actually the law says we can grow 2 plants for personal consumption, with restrictions on plant height and amount you can possess all at once.

t1_dtls498	1	*	> freedom *from* religion you fucks!  xD
t1_dtlso7i	1	*	It was right-wing, it was created at request from catholic conservative groups. After the revolution all parties adopted non right wing names so they wouldn't be banned.
t1_dtln84y	1	*	I know, I was joking. My original guess was that amphetamine may make you focus on stuff other than your driving, lessening your focus on the road, which another poster confirmed.
t1_dtm8lcb	1	*	It's all good!
t1_dtlolxc	0	*	> fent  They're infatuated with fent because it's perhaps more available? I imagine they'd change their habits if high quality heroin was more readily available but whos to say really.
t1_dtlzir6	0	*	They really are. fuck stimulants all they do is get you addicted and not much more. They're like, drugs for dumb people.
t1_dtmacfe	1	*	No. It's like saying most people in jail in USA is black. It's a fact. But that doesn't mean most black people are thieves or murderers.
t1_dtlozsj	1	*	Same with shrooms. But if you hold off a few months it gets better.  Also, with both, there is no chemical addiction (unlike with nicotine).
t1_dtln438	0	*	I wish we had those films in Canada, though. The tablets take maybe 10 minutes to dissolve. They're so easy to divert and sell that it isn't even funny.
t1_dtm8z3i	0	*	The only advantage of Methadone is that is legal. It is just pharma money making scheme. 
t1_dtlq56a	0	*	Feels especially that way in BC. They have determined the PM before our votes are even tallied. FeelsBadMan.
t1_dtlo05f	1	*	When you lose your job because you're smashing coke throughout the day, that $15 starts to be expensive again
t1_dtlplnk	1	*	I remember in Vancouver we fought hard for InSite. I wouldn't be surprised if it stayed open even if federal law changed, like the pot dispensaries have continued operation despite being illegal.
t1_dtlme9s	0	*	Sarcasm?

t1_dubwdv2	0	*	If you're just gonna call everything China related BS, why even read the article or comment? I mean, it's literally just planting trees. The PLA has a track record of actually doing things like that.

t1_dubvt97	1	*	Oh I bet, but lets saying that if train all day everyday, at a certain point you are going to be burnt out physically or mentally. Any your next block of training is going to be wasted 
t1_dubu855	1	*	Your GPA however. If I get too low of grades my gpa will drop and I could lose my internships. Makes it very tempting to cheat sometimes.
t1_dubwugc	0	*	Air Force so what if it's raining, or too sunny, or too cloudy, to humid or even too dry. And if it's a nice day  a perfect day it would be a shame to wast it by doing work.
t1_dubugcd	0	*	Faiths are bullshit. Simple as that. But that's irrelevant. We're not arguing whether about an innocent faith, but rather a faith that exploits the poor, the ignorant and the desperate. Like a cult.

t1_dubl0lt	0	*	Defrauding poor desperate people doesn't count?  Or is it always CCP propaganda if it doesn't fit your narrative? Does  people saying they have been tricked by them count? Or are they all liars too?

t1_dubxil8	1	*	Cool.
t1_duc3afl	1	*	Sounds like a bad idea indeed
t1_dubt1g8	1	*	Yeah almost everyone gets it wrong the first time. I know I did. But after that it's usually pretty straight forward. 
t1_dubkzfu	1	*	Outside of school. It was just during my time in highschool
t1_dubru7m	0	*	That's interesting. I remember being told it was against regulations to bury them in the compost heap. I wonder if there would be residual bacteria in that

t1_dv1554b	0	*	Your ignorance of geopolitical importance is astounding.
t1_dv19qjm	1	*	Stalin took the Baltic states as he was on his way to Berlin - they literally were on the way. After all, he had a World War to win. 
t1_du4z44m	1	*	I've not pretended anything. I refuted your strawman argument in favor of Russia. Just because a minister or plenty lied for some reason doesn't suddenly make Russia's actions justifiable.
t1_dsm7cdz	0	*	Yeah, went on holiday and little doggo kept coming to my hotel room, so I adopted her.

t1_dt29ksk	0	*	Right, because you're the leading expert in this subject who understands world politics
t1_dt2ttzv	1	*	One person? That one person was responsible for a lot of death. His existence was a public health hazard probably more severe than a few dozen polio cases.
t1_dt2buvs	1	*	> you cant have a wrong opinion.  This opinion is wrong. 
t1_dt827zy	1	*	So, you're asserting that only perfectly-enforced laws are worth respecting?  That's an... *interesting* legal and ethical approach, I'll give you that.
t1_dt34u7r	0	*	This doesn't make any goddamn sense. The Pakistanis are supposed to be our allies. The Kurds and the Turks are not allies. You've also introduced a third party into the equation for some reason. 
t1_dt2ibxj	1	*	No, he wasn't, he only did a single injection, the vaccination needs 3 injections to work.

t1_duwiouh	0	*	These are the kinds of spam blogs that Russia put up. You've yet to mention any leaks, and that shit blog certainly didn't cite any sources. So I guess your leaks are shit.
t1_duexrvp	1	*	Canadian subs are being overrun with these types of posts lately.  I agree, smells Russian.

t1_dufaha5	0	*	Did the sun get the same amount of federal funding as the CBC?
t1_dufkql0	0	*	Not that funny, really. The independent secessionist Chechen state was an islamist shitshow.  However, Russia's behaviour in that war was horrendous.
t1_dugy9ov	0	*	These small boats were pictured in Novorossiysk bay. You can see a sub too. There is enough depth. Even for the old PANAMAX standard.

t1_dsw0luf	0	*	You are talking complete none sense.   Do you have a source that says the ones being deported were not reviewed?  What an idiotic request.
t1_dsvskce	1	*	That's not true, as 10 seconds on google would tell you.  For example there are atheist Jews.
t1_dsvrl1m	1	*	I just met a guy who was in the Israeli army last week who told me he was ethnically Jewish but he doesn't believe in religion.
t1_dsvdob4	1	*	This is a stupid argument. 
t1_dswmsdo	1	*	I was actually trolling there. Gotcha. Seriously though, whiteness is a social construct but it's one that people mostly agree on.
t1_dsvtgl2	0	*	Wrong.  I could go to Israel tomorrow saying my mother is Jewish, but I'm an atheist, and still be given citizenship because its considered an ethnicity.
t1_dsvrj2b	0	*	Just because you think this doesn't mean everyone agrees with you.

t1_du381jk	0	*	Aren't you the one wanting closer ties with India? Won't get that with that attitude. 
t1_du3barz	0	*	You 'though' wrong.  Back in 1971, India certainly were not strong enough to take on both Pakistan and the US.   Together with Russia, they were.
t1_du4i7pj	1	*	My only question is why are you trying to make India and China into an enemy you sound like an american bot.

t1_dulhryn	0	*	Yeah no we are not stuck in the 20th Century.
t1_dulibgr	0	*	Im sorry.... did you really just say Sweden got to pick who they wanted? Ive been living in Sweden for the past year and I can tell you that is absolutely untrue.

t1_dulavm9	0	*	Digging graves is bomb the middle east for decades.

t1_dtxnup6	0	*	Hey Farva what's the name of that restaurant you like with all the goofy shit on the walls and the mozzarella sticks?  
t1_dtxng3q	1	*	It's a PDF of an Abrams tank. It will crash Adobe Reader and then Adobe Reader will need maintenance.
t1_dty6g06	1	*	What does that have to do with the discussion at hand?   Your moral problem with a spy plane has no bearing on whether or not it could have crashed or was hacked. 
t1_dtxd1i7	1	*	Ah okay. I must have missed that they built regular F-5 knock-offs  themselves. Thanks.
t1_dtx7r71	0	*	No it's not. SOFAs were actually agreed upon. There is zero hypothetical about that.
t1_dtxemum	0	*	*you wouldnt download an abrams tank, would you?*
t1_dtxu3fw	1	*	Ya know.  The finger.
t1_dtyaurk	0	*	Do you always parrot what the other person says to you, or is this a one-time thing? You should be incredibly embarrassed by this showing.
t1_dtyctkz	1	*	Hay Farva what's that thing where we put goofy Freedom shit on the walls and invite the Americans over and then they give us tanks?
t1_dtx9a18	1	*	There are experts in US too. 
t1_dv5zkcw	0	*	Legend has it that FloridaMan from Tarpon Springs invented it. Come to think of it, I think his last name was actually greek-sounding, though.
t1_dsbywwo	1	*	Of course, I never said otherwise.   Doesnt mean it is toxic in all amounts, or that it might not be beneficial in some doses.    I dont know what youre trying to argue. 
t1_ds93ee1	0	*	So emotion pain is basically trauma to the whole body.  Yeah, that sounds about right.
t1_ds852dp	0	*	I think I'd rather my parents smoke pot than for me to be chronically neglected or perhaps even sexually and physically abused time and again in foster homes
t1_ds8bnli	1	*	I want to ask why anyone would do this, while realizing that it is not a very good question.
t1_ds8wxrv	0	*	Who says I haven't.
t1_dun9fe3	1	*	Which terror attack in the UK was carried out with machine guns?
t1_dun9s4s	1	*	We had a civil conflict though, not random deranged shooters
t1_duf0yvq	0	*	Lots of the top restuarants have it on their menus and Woolworths has it in their meat section. I can't see them taking that risk if it was iffy.
t1_duewyvt	1	*	That was my assumption but a few 'hunters' have suggested otherwise, but I don't eat meat anyways so it's not something I really ever dove into.
t1_dufu38v	0	*	In the third world.maybe. in a developed country it's rarely necessary to hunt. People do it for fun.
t1_dufc3of	1	*	Have you read about any cases of people getting worms from roo meat? Ive eaten heaps and never got worms. I like it rare as well
t1_dugqnji	1	*	Alg, actually that's probably a running misunderstanding throughout the whole thread.
t1_ds6ad6h	1	*	Wow, what a rebuttal.  >You blind fool.  Please explain how the above comment makes me a blind fool.
t1_ds6m2sf	0	*	Kinda. It's where a terrorist holds your loved-one hostage so that they can force you to blow yourself up. Irish terrorists used the tactic.
t1_ds7xhxx	1	*	Pls explain why he was breaking in the first place. You're conveniently leaving out that part    
t1_ds70n9a	1	*	Yeah, I know about that, and it's a mere coincidence. 
t1_ds7dquj	1	*	Exactly 
t1_ds8eznb	0	*	You will still be poor as a terrorist, but you won't starve to death. As for job perks, you get some free rifles and biweekly shipment of women.
t1_ds74s1a	1	*	Yes. The Afghanistan was was not inherently justifiable.
t1_ds68nrq	1	*	You should read up on the Bangladesh war. Wikipedia is your friend. 
t1_ds61r1j	0	*	Sorry just like US government, Chinese government helps itself. 
t1_ds76rka	1	*	So instead of diplomatically pressuring Afghanistan and providing the evidence knowing that the situation has changed drastically....the US goes straight to war regardless.  
t1_ds76ukk	1	*	The Taliban most certainly would not because they mainly cared about Afghanistan. Also they were students. And regardless they still were the government in control of most of Afghanistan at the time 
t1_ds9eee2	0	*	Crickets...
t1_dtki3mm	1	*	but they do not fuck themselves up intentionally. and that is all they need to do to surpass the usa in terms of influence and power. they are already close to it.

t1_dtk33er	0	*	Yeah, I mean, when have we attacked a sovereign nation who hadn't attacked us since the cold war? /s
t1_dsezgke	0	*	Hmmh I don't think so. If there is one I haven't heard about it. It matters little anyway I guess - science isn't democratic.
t1_ds4uw6v	0	*	He's pushing an agenda, he doesn't care about logic.
t1_dt2gup9	0	*	Nice deflection. Also your comments about alts makes no sense   I asked a question  >where did I say they can raise it to the level of the US?   You can use the \> symbol to quote me
t1_dsv49cp	0	*	There is no point in continuing if someone tries claiming things that have no historical basis, you couldn't get a single legitimate citation to say the things you are claiming
t1_dsthal9	0	*	> the Oslo Accords can't possibly override  That's nice, but it has been happening for the last 20 years.
t1_dst9a0n	0	*	And killing hundreds of women and children makes Israel moral?
t1_dstv7co	1	*	Just because you don't have the same culture and faith doesn't mean we need to disregard a whole peoples culture and faith.
t1_dsthc4a	0	*	Yes, they do.

t1_dst9arb	0	*	Have you ever actually considered that what Palestinians do is in self defense?
t1_dstarhh	0	*	> And America killed more Germans than the Nazis killed Americans.  Holy shit, is this an honest argument?
t1_dstq8zr	0	*	You mean human shields for military targets
t1_dsth3a6	0	*	Yes, they do. Abbas has threatened to back out of them, but has never actually done it.
t1_dsths5n	0	*	So how come Israel decides on new construction in Area C and the PA decides on new construction in Area A and B?  They need to listen to you, is what they need to do.
t1_dst8zfe	0	*	You're literally defending shooting people in wheelchairs for protesting. Gross
t1_dstfcyg	0	*	Which border was that? 
t1_dsu326o	0	*	Sorry, but Israel started the war. 
t1_dstyy4l	1	*	They live in an Israeli defined military zone in occupied Palestinian land and most settlers are armed.
t1_dsu37ig	1	*	Oh what's that, they should give the money back because they don't need it? 
t1_dsu7z3z	0	*	Do some research on the formation of israel and their conflicts with the Palestinian Arabs and other Arabs.   The situation is far from black and white
t1_ds3t5do	0	*	Make an argument against aiding the Afghan insurgency, potentially preventing the fall of the Soviet Union.
t1_dtf9qi4	0	*	See, this is what I'm talking about, people instantly lose their mind when different opinions are voiced and feel the need to insult the other person.Well done
t1_dutn7fo	0	*	Well technically, the Catholic church is the oldest, largest, systematic child abuse organisation in all of history. So yknow... don't feel like the hate is unwarranted. 
t1_dutjnli	0	*	I think shingles (sp?) is like adult onset chicken pox. However I may be mixing shingles up with something else. 
t1_dutxe0w	1	*	It's no lessor than the mind that conceived of God.
t1_dutuk52	1	*	No.  I meant what I said.  Truth can be your own observation, but you must be able to accept your limits.  Right now you are only one data point in a sea of flowing lines of data.
t1_dutxx9k	1	*	Thanks, I just changed my comment.  You just earned yourself a free blowjob.
t1_duti0ei	0	*	Why does being on Medicaid make it a hassle to see your doctor? I legit don't know anything about Medicaid.
t1_dutjb2l	0	*	Yes indeed. Not sure why the earlier commenter was using that quote to suggest lower vaccination rate is because of refugees
t1_dutqvw3	0	*	At that point I feel euthansia is preferrable.
t1_dutis4d	0	*	Public education is generally fine across the developed world.  You can throw all the money at education and still end up a Trump if you refuse to listen.
t1_dutrm1u	0	*	Yes it is. There's a reason you get can religious exemptions from vaccinating your kid.
t1_dutjnqy	0	*	The mental gymnastics required to view vaccines as potentially bad are fucking idiotic. This thread is honestly kinda ridiculous.
t1_dutub7u	1	*	Jews were kicked out of Tzar's controlled territory starting in the late 18th century. Didn't realize you were incompetent and didn't know anything about Jewish history.

t1_duty2d4	0	*	If a kid isn't vaccinated how is he a threat to those that are?
t1_duu1n0g	0	*	Solution we take over the world make the smart people be in charge and take people like them and make them legally sub human also so we can enslave them and hunt them down
t1_dutm96n	0	*	Yea sounds like how I feel about my dads side of the family and their mega republican ideals about nonwhite people. 
t1_duugsp3	1	*	Sorry i didnt mean to direct it at anyone in particular, i just had to vent while on lunch lol. Please forgive!
t1_duts5wo	1	*	It used to be thousands of people died due to ignorance surrounding medical and physical issues.    Guess times havent changed that much. 
t1_duuwtqg	0	*	If you think that, you're literally an authoritarian.  You don't get to decide you're right and then force other people to do it your way.  Even if you *are* right.
t1_dutj59m	1	*	pretty much.
t1_dutokt1	0	*	Correct, but it also doesn't rule it out.
t1_duv93ne	1	*	Good thing rats never are on ships.

t1_dutlro1	1	*	Yeah, he is.
t1_dutrtg8	1	*	Comment was edited after another redditor linked an article :)
t1_dutjfn7	0	*	We are talking about Europe. In most of Europe,especially where there have been fatalities due to measles, everyone gets the same education and university is free for everyone.
t1_dutgk5i	1	*	Depends on if you think it's been 10 years or not. If it's been over 10 years then yes go get one
t1_dutmew5	1	*	Because the spectrum is so wide, that could be very true for some cases. But not all. 
t1_duuh251	0	*	I don't think it's selectively breeding just because attractive people don't want the uggos. That's just attraction.

t1_dutju02	1	*	It is when you miss out words like I did  He's not talking about is what it should have been.
t1_dutl63s	1	*	Unfortunately there is a significant community of SDs who congregate together and solidify the idea that their delusion is as valid as any medical diagnosis.
t1_dutkin9	1	*	What does that even mean? This is faith in the US government. MKULTRA is relevant.
t1_dutn5h4	1	*	I have heard there is a shingles vaccine now that may be effective for people over 50.  I would definitely check with her doctor on that.  Im not old enough for medical insurance to cover it.
t1_dutkq8d	0	*	Okay Karl Rove. 
t1_dutrj70	0	*	Vaccines don't cause autism. This giant essay you wrote is totally pointless.
t1_dutlqmd	1	*	> Europeans have even more reason to distrust their government than Americans do and most of them do it anyway.   Ok? You're describing insanity to me. Right?
t1_dutjz4x	1	*	He means general immunity, but you actually can get chicken pox again later in life, but only by getting it from someone else.
t1_dutyeku	1	*	Virologists & epidemiologists most likely. 
t1_dutk8wq	1	*	My sister had it twice. First time was just a mild case, so that probably had something to do with it.

t1_dutk7en	1	*	That may be accurate, but that doesn't make it any less stupid.
t1_dutj0qa	1	*	Are you in the US? You can get a TDAP shot at the Target pharmacy (or anywhere really that offers vaccinations). You don't need to see your doc to get most of these shots. 
t1_duto6ye	1	*	EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR NO REASON 
t1_dutqxyq	0	*	You can get it as a vaccine, if you don't want to risk your child having a pock-marked face for the rest of their life.

t1_dutqfo9	0	*	And my coworker died during surgery from the anesthetics a few days ago.  Doesn't mean Im going to launch a campaign against putting people under during operations.

t1_duto915	0	*	Unfortunately, both shingles vaccines (zostavax and shingrix) are indicated for use in populations 50 and older. The above commenter is entirely correct. 
t1_dutka3x	0	*	So you didn't read the article? 35 of those 21,000 died. So over 8 times the rate that you're claiming, and this was in developed countries.
t1_dutpfcv	1	*	Buy my nutraceuticals! WHERE ARE MY KIDS?!
t1_dutwmbn	0	*	Ok that actually is kinda misleading. You have a point. Good morning Britain should apologize.

t1_dv4d8he	0	*	Often it's bad compression or no compression.    Sometimes, like with Titanfall 2, you have uncompressed sound taking a ton of space just because it helps very low end computers a bit.
t1_dv4dwsy	0	*	Not really both are valid measurements of data, just one get 8x bigger numbers. Like measuring something in seconds and minutes, seconds gives bigger numbers.
t1_dv4dl5w	1	*	1 MB = 8 Mb
t1_dv49itd	0	*	I can tell you're being genuinely serious... I feel for you. 
t1_dv4gmgx	0	*	Your thinking Gibibit and Mebibytes not Gigabit and Megabit which are units of 1000
t1_dv48cva	1	*	Dude... why did you even bring up mobile speed? No one was talking about it. You cant being up something unrelated then tell everyone they are wrong because you changed the subject...
t1_dv4cchq	0	*	Graphics are big files. Also, compression leaves fragments that they probably want to avoid.
t1_dv4a24w	1	*	Also,maybe OP's hard drive bottleneckes his download speeds.I know mine did before i upgraded to an SSD.Now i get 948/257.(Mine is not symmetric)
t1_dv4c9x1	1	*	I meant that the actual transfer rate hasn't been reached on fiber, as of now it's limited by the hardware. Copper does 15-20 mbits on regular hardware before it fails. 
t1_dv4jo9i	1	*	My pleasure! - information is there to be spread and enjoyed! I've written more further down if you care to read it. Either way enjoy your day and know your prefixes and bases hehe
t1_dv4mqx6	1	*	They show Megabits. Speedtest and fast.net are the 2 I usually use. 
t1_dv48od4	0	*	We still get the exact same network congestion on fibre. I have supposedly 200Mb but it often drops due to high levels of traffic on the network. Imagine 4g/5g will be the same.
t1_dv4jsj0	1	*	Apologises, I felt it correct to do as OP was being sold 1gbps, so it was a relevant unit to use. While I was talking bits and bytes figured I'd cover kilo/kibi base 2 / base 10.
t1_dv4dod3	1	*	That is my thought. The engineer that attended did spend an hour or two trying to sort it but it does still seem silly. 
t1_dv4nujg	0	*	Last I heard Comcast was requiring router rentals at 15 dollars a month in areas they have a monopoly...
t1_dv4aby4	1	*	Yeah exactly this. In my old rented place (where internet was provided) I could download stuff in a snap. But if I tried to play online games the lag made them unplayable.
t1_dv49vrn	1	*	Rural Kansan here. Best I can get is 6 mbps down and 1 mbps up. Luckily they seem to have the cap higher than that because at 4am I can sometimes get 8 or 9 down. Either way, it sucks 
t1_dv4pqyw	0	*	That's fucking stupid, sorry. If 95% of people wanted to kill all jews and re-enslave blacks would you still say go for it?
t1_dv48k1p	1	*	I bet it costs a lot of bucks
t1_dv49db8	0	*	Not necessarily although I see what you mean. Often microwave links are used for larger distances but then yeah probably fibre at some point
t1_dv496s9	0	*	Yep, but I'm lucky if I get more then 110 kilobytes up and 1.5 megabytes down, I keep moving away from new NBN locations.
t1_dv4b4fj	1	*	And here I am sitting in the states with my 300mb down 100mb up residential. 
t1_dv4gyss	1	*	So one of the things.  Dont know why my previous comment was downvoted.  Language matters, friends.
t1_dv4cm2q	1	*	Yeah, but your economy isnt propped up on natural resources, and your country is a superpower. 
t1_dv4hcpl	1	*	Yeah I used the two interchangeably. For reference, I got a 1mbps connection on my potato home line and I do international Skype alright, at 360p 20fps.
t1_dv4b5ma	0	*	I wish U0001f627 but I did just get a kidney transplant, so at least I found a dying human to keep someone else's organs inside of. 
t1_dv4ee8p	0	*	the number is just so incredibly small my brain just could not compute it and made it into a more manageable reading of the sentence...
t1_dv4exyz	0	*	That last thing is more of an issue with hard drives where they count the drive in base 10 instead of base 2.
t1_dv4laz0	0	*	their current modems seem to be decent. Paying like $70/month for 250/20 and im consistently getting 280~290/20 
t1_dv4f1ya	1	*	Well Ive got google fiber
t1_dv48gi5	0	*	Relevant username
t1_dv4k376	1	*	In that case if you record that you might be able to attempt to get it. Especially if you get multiple reps recorded saying it. At that point it's considered consumer fraud isn't it?
t1_dv4o1rf	1	*	If you have to ask, you're streets behind. 
t1_dv4cclk	0	*	Its very common in the US. Almost no one gets variable rate mortgages. I cant imagine not knowing month to month how much youre going to owe on your mortgage. Thats nuts. 
t1_dv4bicy	0	*	1gig was 40 a month, now paying 20 for 250. This is in Finland

t1_dv4gyys	1	*	Very cool to see people using crypto in real life. Keep it up man! Mass adoption is around the corner :)
t1_dv5tw1t	0	*	https://www.flickr.com/photos/ssong/35774979346/  Speeds can be fast, but thats a lot of cables and distance to get to any major internet center. 
t1_dv58rg0	1	*	Miles Ahead is a cool album, it was definitely streets ahead
t1_dv4c85r	1	*	I'm not all that tech savvy so I don't know the exact details. I just heard from a friend dealing with TPG.
t1_dv4dgu9	1	*	It's the primary type that's offered in the US - thank the recession for that one - but the rates aren't at all bad either.
t1_dv4bbmp	1	*	No doubt, the math is per fiber and nothing in regards to advancements made.  Edit: fiber is exponentially faster than copper.
t1_dv48o6g	0	*	Not a labor bloke but deadset funniest cunt on morning TV. I dont like either of the two major parties. Give me an independent govt.
t1_dv4e7r8	1	*	Depends on what the something's are. 
t1_dv48hpg	1	*	Um....Bambi...
t1_dv4kuhv	1	*	ah well your internet will soon kick mine's as then as i have max 10mb, 500gb limit, for $110. i am jealous.
t1_dv49b8v	1	*	I live in a rural city, can confirm I would love 20mbps. But highest Ive gotten is a round 12 but usually average about 6 maybe, on a good day.
t1_dv4szcq	0	*	On Bell fibe I get 302 on my 300MB  connection. It's very expensive though and also I live across the street from the local fibe distribution center so my latency is like 0. 
t1_dv48kyb	1	*	Tech Support here, this is the truth.

t1_dv4w076	0	*	Why did you spread misinformation about something you literally knew nothing about?
t1_dv4avio	1	*	Comcast might be horrible, but Americans have no idea how good they've got it compared to us.
t1_dv53xic	0	*	Well yeah, but that would be comparable to a website throttling your download speeds, not your ISP.
t1_dv4bmqd	0	*	More detailed textures, polygons, larger worlds
t1_dv48cpp	1	*	Dude... why did you even bring up mobile speed? No one was talking about it. You cant being up something unrelated then tell everyone they are wrong because you changed the subject...
t1_dv4cnd4	0	*	Well yeah, its constantly adding content. Updates to the story and the galaxy. New ships and other goodies. 
t1_dv4l83m	1	*	Basically all wifi is always on. Comcast's routers are pieces of garbage, but it wasn't the wifi that was screwing with your connection.
t1_dv4fh81	0	*	What do you use those kinds of speeds for? Seems like overkill. 
t1_dv4bcws	0	*	To be completely fair it is my first night using NBN and its a Saturday night, so who knows how good itll get on other weekdays.

t1_ds5dx4f	0	*	I'm okay with sharing my salary, so everyone should be    
t1_ds5c8a6	0	*	And so it is entirely reasonable for women to make less than men, on average, despite there being no discrimination.
t1_ds5af14	0	*	No, no it's not. It's multi flavoured gum stuck to the bottom of bus benches these days. Useless, chewed up, run the course, but there it is, still stuck there.
t1_ds5h4n3	1	*	It could very well be discriminatory practices too, but that is definitely part of it. Women put less effort into negotiating on average
t1_ds5aayi	1	*	what twaddle. lol.  I guess it's another case of trying to be as good as.  
t1_ds5fs4p	1	*	The article I linked shows over 150 female *soldiers* died from 1991-2013. More have died since. Women *die in wars as soldiers*. These are women doing their jobs as soldiers in war zones and dying. 
t1_ds5duss	1	*	>Why? Why does it matter?  \>looks at username   All makes sense to me now

t1_dtnyaby	0	*	How so?  The last two democratic presidents both pushed for very big free trade agreements during their term (NAFTA and TPP), What has the democratic party been doing that's protectionist?

t1_dur9grm	1	*	This guy knows Germans
t1_duriyxd	1	*	It is not.  Japan is already denying it.  Many people in Japan outright think it never happened.  Germany does not deny it.  What is the difference between the two?
t1_dus5kaq	1	*	Is that literally the reason why we opposed Stalin? To protect our buddies in Western Europe from Evil?  Happy side-effects do not benevolence make.
t1_durgudi	0	*	The comment you replied to said we didnt ask to be attacked on our own soil and your response was to bring up a century-old grievance. Resentments arent an excuse for a surprise attack. 
t1_dura46r	0	*	In American public school all I learned was about the prison camps/Aushwitz and the diary of Anne Frank.  But boy howdy could I talk about the American Civil War.
t1_durivz6	0	*	Operation Downfall was already starting to come underway. There was a very limited timeframe to use the nuclear option and we took it.
t1_durbrax	0	*	I didn't know about the Purple Hearts. That's really interesting.  Do you happen to know how many PHs are given each year, roughly?
t1_durj17g	0	*	Oh guess its not happening then good point
t1_durfb3y	1	*	Japan plays the victim when they were the instigator.  Germany owns what they did and collectively feel guilty.
t1_durfrj2	0	*	I think it more of the fact that Japan straight out deny ever raping and killing 6 million people. The US do not deny their atrocities, but obviously no nation is going to  promote that shit. 
t1_durt6tt	1	*	the leader thinks he could take on the allied forces and refuses to surrender.... if that nuke wasnt drop you think there will be less casualties? 
t1_durm6k8	1	*	Jerk it?
t1_dureve4	0	*	y and z did worse things so that makes xs absolutely atrocious war crimes irrelevant  yeah ok, bud.
t1_dusnw1f	0	*	Dude I just thought the person I was responding to would find that interesting ok? Sorry that you think I'm perpetuating some sentiment but I'm not trying to. I'm just on reddit
t1_durc69b	1	*	but when we leave you morons alone for some reason Chavez and Maduro start making sense. So okay.
t1_durexkf	1	*	I think you're reading your own bias into my comment. 
t1_duri7ai	0	*	You actually understood what his point was?
t1_durcvru	1	*	if only it WERE bullshit.  wake up.
t1_durtnj4	1	*	Sorry...I guess you said that in your post. I was hoping it was third grade or something. I know we are not good at knowing global geography but we should know our own state on a map. Cripes.
t1_durgar3	0	*	These commenters don't seem to value empathy and what we can learn emotionally as well as factually from speakers like these.
t1_durt7kz	0	*	your previous question is idiotic.. were talking about war
t1_durjxnf	0	*	The whole campaign throughout North China was horrific and the focus on Nanking alone seriously undersells it.
t1_durmi2b	1	*	I'm not saying that I didn't expect them to fight, what I'm saying is that while unfortunate the lives of 200,000 people pales in comparison to to the lives of 13 million people.
t1_durkh3e	0	*	Again, could you please provide a source for this?
t1_durltzz	1	*	Dont you know we need to get busy with re glorifying war so we can ezexute mass depopulation and other atrocities again?  /S
t1_durm3gu	1	*	How did you know lol. Man am I glad for the internet and access to information. Its crazy to think that most of history peoples perception of everything could just be...chosen for them.
t1_dutag0t	0	*	And you really think the Japanese government (or the heads of the government) were really going to be fine with just having the home islands? 
t1_durgkn0	0	*	was a hundred years ago
t1_durc99g	0	*	Well- hopefully there wont be anymore major wars. 
t1_duriw3i	0	*	Ill check that link out, sounds very interesting!
t1_dus83f5	1	*	This is a myth.   Edit: downvote all you want, doesn't change the facts. 
t1_dur80cn	0	*	Because what the Germans did with the refugees was really stupid, so either Germans are inherently stupid, or they're just stupid when clouded by guilt. 
t1_dus8d31	0	*	Its obvious you hate the fact that all can see their denialism. Get madder.
t1_dure5yb	1	*	Also probably true.
t1_duredpm	1	*	Nobody but Nazis were big fans of the Swiss in WWII.  But nobody was willing to attack a fortress country either...
t1_durd993	1	*	I was really enjoying this until you told me it was ruined.
t1_durfst7	1	*	Spent extensive time on slavery and the ethnic cleansing of native peoples starting in middle school.  In the South.  In a rural county that voted for Trump 80-20.  Speak for yourself.
t1_duruaqh	0	*	The Japanese and Germans were tried for bombing cities, that was one of Goering's trials.   Unless it was all basically victors justice lol 
t1_durc8kl	1	*	I think you overestimate the level of education we have in the USA as a whole. You must know that the average, and worst levels of education are much, much lower than what you just mentioned.
t1_dutmb6o	1	*	So true.  If only Reddit knew how it's gamed by everyone - not just the Russians.
t1_dusi18b	1	*	This is like saying we should have accepted a German surrender where they get to keep Poland and France.
t1_durdqrm	0	*	They committed one of the classic blunders.  Never get involved in a land war in Asia.
t1_durbrf0	0	*	Real vets? It's extremely common for homeless to pretend to be vets.
t1_durjo9o	0	*	Well if were comparing what children are learn in schools, then its quite accurate. Theres a lot of then the trail of tears happened....but now we have California! With a lot left out in between
t1_dure5j3	1	*	Funding them to tell one sided stories
t1_durgnzt	0	*	Hitler never played Risk when he was a kidddddd...
t1_durcflo	0	*	Unlike you, I can feel sympathy for both parties of victims instead of pitting one group against the other.
t1_dv03s35	1	*	minnesota sucks I went to school there too. Enjoy the maybe spring.
t1_durgmu1	0	*	Im glad you see broad assumptions about the character of others as giving your opinion but its highly uncalled for in a historical discussion and it detracts from logic-based dialogue. 
t1_duru2xy	0	*	Why would we negotiate with the most murderous indiscriminate regime in human history? We were going to cleanse Japan of arrogant militarism.
t1_durl2gi	1	*	This confirms the autism
t1_durh0kc	1	*	people were dying every single day of the war. 6 weeks is tens of more bombing runs hitting Japan and hundreds if not thousands of more civilians dying with every attack. 
t1_durcqml	0	*	Could we adapt it again and have Mel Gibson or Spielberg make it
t1_durtwpr	0	*	Didnt some of the IJA/IJN officers attempt to launch a coup against the emperor to continue the war?  
t1_duro1i1	0	*	Why would you accept conditional surrender from the aggressor who you have beaten back?
t1_durhfwl	1	*	[Futurama](https://youtu.be/tk1dd1D2Kts)
t1_durfi3k	0	*	Uh... apology accepted.
t1_durjgv4	0	*	> The Allies didn't kill millions through bombing either.   Did I say millions died? I said millions were burned.   
t1_durdxbp	0	*	Hyperbole 
t1_dus0hr9	1	*	Thank you for the information!
t1_durd3cx	1	*	Propoganda in motion. Pretty interesting
t1_durgi87	0	*	Why do we need to raise awareness for what a nuclear bomb does to people? Are you kidding? 
t1_durdvgk	1	*	There's nothing quite like punching a face
t1_durh0at	1	*	>Source?  His ass. 
t1_dut6rqq	0	*	Mildly right wing actually, note Shinzo Abe hasn't exactly resurrected the Asia for Asians sentiment, or fully building a massive navy, etc.
t1_durclth	1	*	Im not your bud, pal. 
t1_durvzp4	0	*	Also the fact the one was a uranium bomb and the other a plutonium bomb. Both needed to be tested although Japan already surrendered after the first one.
t1_durjlnz	0	*	If you're willing to berate people for not being informed and yet not willing to take the time to explain your point or view then what the fuck is the point of even commenting 
t1_dure54r	1	*	Fair enough. I'm glad, then.
t1_durden2	1	*	Yes. That's a very good, succinct way of saying it.  I am many things, but I am not succinct.
t1_dutjdxz	0	*	Don't worry I think I can survive an attack from anyone that uses the word twerp unironically.
t1_dure5zx	0	*	Yeah, it's about you congrats, and it's amusing
t1_durxrq1	0	*	Why would that matter? Who's gonna prosecute them?
t1_dus0hgv	0	*	Because one was exposed seventy years ago from a bomb, and the other is working in healthcare. There is no relation whatsoever. 
t1_durt0mu	1	*	Only after China invaded Alaska tho, because I guess Canada didn't like that America wanted to ship troops directly through to the front by way of Canada 
t1_durhbhl	0	*	That 20 million and 30 million are comparable numbers?
t1_duszkfd	1	*	[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_American_Heritage_Sites_(National_Park_Service) you go, friend!  ^(Next time, maybe you can google it yourself...)
t1_durcfld	0	*	Not OP, but I don't have a problem with the the people telling the stories, I have a problem with the government of Japan promoting this while not even acknowledging their warcrimes. 
t1_dutcd95	1	*	So we've done good things and bad things. So has nearly every other first world country.   I'm by all means a Patriot, but I'm not a nationalist...
t1_durkyjm	0	*	You missed the word *outstanding*, i.e. yet to be apologised for.  > You should perhaps reflect on your own inadequate ability to read closely  HAHAHAHA
t1_durdf9a	0	*	[Free](http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/01112/mission_accomplish_1112950c.jpg)[dom](https://www.iraqbodycount.org)[!](https://youtu.be/cRflSSrg6rY)  
t1_durcxhc	1	*	I definitely agree that people don't know enough about Japan. Most people I know have no idea of the things that were done in China (and elsewhere, but the Chinese seemed to get it particularly bad).
t1_dus63oq	0	*	Dive bombing attempted accuracy, and generally on a per bomb basis, hit it's intended target more than the carpet bombing. Because in carpet bombing there is no intended target.
t1_du783oa	0	*	I expanded on their statement in the chance they meant their stance should apply to all men.  
t1_du78b38	0	*	No. Gotchas should not be your goal. Making someone out a hypocrite and being smug about it is rude. *No history diving.*
t1_du7aqfy	1	*	Divorced men can be incels 
t1_du797mz	0	*	Wtf. Youre saying being a hypocrite is worse than raping multiple women. 
t1_du78jhn	1	*	I'm saying most MGTOW are more than likely incels
t1_du77nmr	1	*	Considering almost everyone commenting had no idea what it meant, it appears you are incorrect
t1_du7d5ez	1	*	lol absolutely not.  This isn't an sub about gender and sexual politics anyway, just a story about it. 
t1_dsgmdb3	1	*	It's pretty similar. I just grew up hearing this version of it and it got stuck with me, means basically the same thing.
t1_dses94r	0	*	What are you going to do, not buy things? Companies are responsible for the environmentally damaging products they create and sell.
t1_dsew4qr	0	*	https://www.nrdc.org/media/2013/130918  
t1_dsf2b5z	0	*	Tesla doesn't make any money. The corporate rate on billions in losses is still zero.
t1_dseuym5	1	*	Well, no, I did, but the thing is it's a loot box. I got a bit of in-game currency, as well as a sense of pride and accomplishment. Hopefully I'll get Hearing in the next lootbox!
t1_dsexsef	0	*	Also how bad for the environment is the production of these batteries? I know the production of the whole car is pretty bad already but what about the battery vs fuel for a normal car?
t1_dsflczz	1	*	ok thanx
t1_dsf5419	1	*	Apple would use the technology only when the batteries in one of their models fails at such a rate that they would have to do a recall. Then they will use this to save themselves money.
t1_dseihdr	0	*	Apple is going to claim they didn't expect the voltage drop issue as batteries degraded.  The prosecutors are going to need to prove otherwise ... to whatever standard is required by French law.
t1_dsezzi0	1	*	I agree with you. For example, American regulators punished Toyota for the ridiculous unsubstantiated claims that their cars accelerated on their own. 
t1_dsep0n2	0	*	Which means that it will make sence buying those over competition.
t1_dshdxwf	0	*	Except when you look at CEO wages going up since the same point in the late 70's. Neoliberal economic policy was to get the rich richer.
t1_dshb3h0	0	*	So increasing it with inflation is kind of arbitrary when there are so many externalities to consider. I'd rather 'cost of living' be a metric used.
t1_dshayb8	0	*	Are you seriously advocating socialism for businesses?
t1_dshavhc	0	*	No one is even surviving, let alone thriving, on the backs of others. Welfare doesn't give you enough to survive.
t1_dsha50k	0	*	Businesses are allowed to fail.  If the only think keeping the lights on is poverty wages of employees, then the business can fail. No business is guaranteed success.
t1_dtb7vqn	0	*	Fuck. Fuck montezumas revenge ever damned time.  Quick abs though, am to right?
t1_dtbhp0d	1	*	No, a tax is when a government collects a portion of earnings to fund it's programs.  What that's called is a racket.
t1_dtba7xm	0	*	Thats pretty shitty source tbh but yeah it could still be right
t1_dtbb3qc	0	*	Groups of people?
t1_dtbbjpf	0	*	Fucking kill them all 
t1_dtc5ocb	1	*	It is a thing in mexico, the church is against the legalization and often talks about it.
t1_dtbeyaq	0	*	Not really, as I am simply applying following his logical assumption.
t1_dtbfgi9	0	*	It isn't a straw-man argument, learn your logical fallacies before spouting them off. If anything it would be a false equivalence, and it isn't even that.
t1_dtbtzbh	0	*	People join cartels becasue the promise of girls and money. People have no jobs there. Increase education andjobs and that shit will go down.
t1_dtb8bg2	0	*	What fucked up movie is this??? 
t1_dtbf0c4	0	*	That's good for you then, like I said, it depends where you're buying it from. I know most people have no fucking clue what their supply chain is like.
t1_dtbk4xg	0	*	I'm not arguing against any of that, I am simply arguing against his statement: People who want to do it will do it anyways.
t1_dtbf1g5	1	*	Maybe like 0.00001%
t1_dtboacm	0	*	El Chapo Guzmans revenge.
t1_dtbr7ur	1	*	Here's a crazy fucking thought...  What if the pharmaceutical started selling weed? Whaaaat? Crazy, I know.
t1_dtbidfs	1	*	redacted
t1_dtbhfs0	1	*	Tribalism is everywhere. 
t1_dtbgm2k	1	*	Avocados AND weed... the two things millennials need to live (especially on the west coast)
t1_dtbej2b	0	*	my only regret is that i have skinitis
t1_dtcbfr1	0	*	Ask Venezuela and Syria how that works out 
t1_dtbn7wc	0	*	Yep, back to the argument that has been used to ban cigarettes in basically every public place in the entire country for the last decade.  I think that argument has won the day, really.
t1_dtbg916	1	*	score hidden is it true. this makes me sad. :(
t1_dtbn2pg	1	*	Skin hurting juice
t1_dtbfqh2	0	*	No more Coke (the drink) for me! I'll use straight cocaine instead!
t1_dssrpwb	1	*	That's fine. I just feel like there's some of confusing mixing and matching of terms that made it hard for me to understand. Immigrants and refugees have very different economic and social impacts.
t1_dsukogl	0	*	The Talmud is not that Oral law, you can't expect an oral tradition to stay the same either
t1_dst8shl	1	*	Im not happy about that either.
t1_dsses86	1	*	Like the state of Israel and many Israeli's continued discrimination vs Ethiopian Jews ?
t1_dst6jec	0	*	Yes, because if one person agrees with one aspect of fascism they are instantly a card-carrying member of the NSDAP.  You twit.
t1_dtfq1un	0	*	Surprisingly it doesn't take the whole group to do this, just a few well placed individuals. Manafort, Flynn, Papadopoulos, to name a few.
t1_dtgjdbt	1	*	Id sell the shit out of my race for that. I wouldn't give a single fuck. 
t1_dtg6hyg	0	*	Started reading her bio and apparently she has an aeronautical science degree from the same school my brother goes to.
t1_dtfm8ap	0	*	That's all it pays? NM then. TIL backstabbers and traitors work cheap.
t1_dtfjs1f	1	*	You can't convert the trolls. But maybe you can keep someone who's wandering by from believing them.
t1_dtfw3xw	1	*	I want ten million dollars, a year, for the rest of my life.
t1_dtgqxu9	1	*	I still cringe at the thought that she exists
t1_dtfu8cf	1	*	Don't forget Reagan and W!
t1_dtgck9g	1	*	100%, that is the entire point.
t1_dtg3s6e	0	*	They promised him a position in Gazprom as an advisor.   He ended up becoming an advisor to Gazprom.  Doesn't sound empty. 
t1_dtfz5lk	0	*	FYI, that's a word pushed by the Share Blue shills. When you use it, it's assume you're one of them./
t1_dtg39j9	0	*	Please let us all know when Obama became a Judge.
t1_dtg3dvp	1	*	They report through the Department of Justice, like the FBI does. It started out as an arm of the Treasury to enforce alcohol and tobacco taxes, but got moved after 9/11.
t1_dtfzpa4	0	*	They would have just given him immunity if he had anything to offer. He's a nobody, they wouldn't waste their time indicting him if he were able to deliver anything remotely valuable.
t1_dtfwcwz	0	*	Except they met in person, multiple times, and maintained contact after Spy #1 left the States.
t1_dtfqpf2	0	*	> they you are referring to?  NPR... JESUS DO YOU EVEN PAY ATTENTION TO THE SHIT YOU LINK???
t1_dtgchg7	0	*	Smart, has chicken, and not too sore on the eyes, we'll throw in some mac and cheese and I think I have found heaven lol 
t1_dtccd4q	0	*	> I came here for facts and perspective not poor logic and ideology.  Ironic considering you are ignoring facts due to your personal ideology.
t1_dtca5wp	1	*	I have posted about 4 links in this thread that show just that.  Read them. 
t1_dt499fb	0	*	Celts migrated into the area in waves going back all the way to the 8th century BC.  There's been plenty of people who've speculated the Dorians were Celts, or at least very closely related.
t1_dt2egbd	0	*	Yeap. Do you see any other reason why FYROM would deny making this agreement permanent for the past 25 years? :)

t1_ds4op8q	1	*	I'm struggling to get back into the groove after the holiday break too
t1_ds5vqv0	0	*	I dont know..  I would tend to lean towards the obvious that your jokes just arent any good.  Take it a constructive criticism or pissed off.  Your choice 
t1_ds4trnw	0	*	Its a sad time we live in. When did people forget how to think for themselves?
t1_ds4tsf9	0	*	Maybe you can look up context once your blinders are gone.
t1_ds5107r	0	*	You do realize that language is imprecise, and that how words are used change over time just like any other aspect of culture, right?
t1_duobrjp	0	*	Well fair enough but I feel Qpid counts as that since it was Robin Hood times. 
t1_duqo47m	0	*	Well then, I doubt these groups giving backlash would agree with you. They wouldn't complain if she was a light-skinned blond-haired girl, despite that being the opposite of what we know about Joan.
t1_duobjkb	0	*	> Race matters when depicting the authenticity of historical accuracy as closely as possible  Right. That's where I take issue. What makes you think that's the aim here?
t1_duobwto	0	*	Would a Japasnese Mary Poppins offend you?
t1_duoyffa	0	*	Charlton Heston?

t1_dup536x	1	*	John of Patmos was on some crazy shit. 
t1_duo52fg	0	*	Therefore we should prevent a tall blonde girl of playing her ? Because I'm quite sure it was never a problem in the past.
t1_duospxq	1	*	Who cares about cultural accuracy. 
t1_duqba30	1	*	Flipping shit if a white man playes a black man, just because he's white, is racism.
t1_duolmi1	0	*	Ahem. Stormy Daniels...
t1_duflblx	1	*	Oh, so you dont want people to justify your demise based on your warped worldview, but just in general. Gotcha.

t1_dsciyvj	0	*	broken record goodbye
t1_dtqv4un	0	*	It's apparently $3 above minimum with relatively unskilled labor. I don't see how this isn't a fair wage. An 18mo degree isn't a 4 year bachelor's degree. If you want more money, move up.
t1_dtr53w0	1	*	Smh. 
t1_duux1q8	1	*	I agree, much rarer nowadays

t1_dsfxe3o	0	*	Yeah that is a good rule of thumb. I never count cals, but if you do IF you don't really have to. Still, as far as nutrition goes, sugar is not adding anything at all, it is a pure pleasure thing :P
t1_dshrvko	0	*	Not saying anything about this specific topic at all.

t1_du8v61b	0	*	Fair enough.  I won't ask you to go dig up news articles but it just seems too unethical to be real.  Then again, crazier things happen every day.

t1_du8j5jf	1	*	Yup

t1_du8ixet	1	*	It's called a donation not a trade
t1_du9hoh9	0	*	What a waste but your option
t1_du8pnkb	0	*	You sound like an angry and sad person. I pity you. I truly hope you find some compassion and inner peace. Have a lovely valentines day.
t1_du8g1yd	1	*	I'm against an option, IMO if your body can save someone's life after you die, no one should have a choice in the matter. 
t1_du8ra12	1	*	No because raping someone who is unconscious isn't a harmless crime. Even if they don't know it happened which is incredibly rare to happen.
t1_du9594q	0	*	Well, society just did, so that is factually incorrect.
t1_du8k2uo	1	*	Jaberwocky?
t1_du8n90n	1	*	If you are only unconscious, not dead, this question is a different one; not completely unrelated, though. The one posed above is about who gets the last word about your dead body.
t1_du8edek	0	*	Yes but we do have to respect personal choice even after death, it's like snatching away inheritance and giving it to a random stranger. 
t1_du8j34x	0	*	I don't see it as much as rights as authority over your property even when you are gone.
t1_du8qbg5	0	*	Seems like I struck a nerve. No, thanks for proving my point. 
t1_du9a8qr	1	*	Well, you see, when you visit a Wikipedia page the default option is just to read it.  Maybe if they changed it so you went to Edit mode automatically we'd see better articles?
t1_du9a26k	0	*	Yes, but he would have to die first. 
t1_du8lu74	1	*	If you ignore the fact that people are still being kicked out of their land today.
t1_du8t788	0	*	If you don't mind my asking, why are you there? What is your opinion on the Israel/Palestine conflict, you seem to hate both sides?
t1_du8uml9	0	*	But what if I'm dead?  (daar gaat het om, als ik dood ben) 
t1_du8la92	0	*	No more prescribing antibiotics then!
t1_du8u753	0	*	Not everyone has extra money...
t1_du8pl2q	0	*	English is hard and I'm not a smart man. 
t1_du8haq2	1	*	Yes, so I wouldn't care. But I would prefer to know that my body will posisbly help someone else to live longer.
t1_du9cbqb	0	*	I was simply responding to assumptions that the people who opt out dont know what its like to deal with long term illnesses or that they dont know anyone who was saved by donor organs.
t1_du8gc66	0	*	You'll be dead and won't care so...
t1_du8jzak	0	*	That's an argument to make the opt-in process less burdensome.  I'd say you've chosen to not be an organ donor because of that burden.
t1_du8mqoe	0	*	>We need more people living on. More people= better chance of a better life for everyone.  nah, overpopulation
t1_du8hbzu	1	*	Not necessarily.
t1_dubhub5	1	*	That's inherent in a right, dude. If healthcare is a right, it is inherently yours, and to take it away would be infringement.
t1_du8h6a5	0	*	So there is a default speed when the brain doesn't?
t1_du8vtdq	0	*	But regardless of statistics, all it takes is one screw up! You'd better refuse, just to be safe!
t1_du8hpw8	1	*	Who told you I wasn't a donor? I never said that. 
t1_du8f95o	0	*	You could force it by murdering them all but you should check your local legislation for the legality of it.
t1_dua1mgr	1	*	Everyone gets a letter when they turn 18. You go thorough screens on the same website you do your taxes on. So you encounter it every year.
t1_du963i9	0	*	Yes, but if you die *because* of kidney failure, you won't have been on dialysis lol.
t1_du8wxjr	1	*	If I'm dead, it doesn't matter.
t1_du8hpxu	0	*	No, you're almost literally forcing people to choose between their beliefs and death. That's incredibly wrong.
t1_du8hu4v	0	*	Needing organs is something time-critical, not some reservation to a restaurant.  Being ranked lower actually equals death in many cases.
t1_du8rhri	1	*	Good one... Lol

t1_du8tttk	0	*	Coming from an insane asylum doctor. I trust this guy. 
t1_du8yr71	0	*	Don't Jews and Muslims generally disapprove of dismembering the body after death? We have an issue in London with some people demanding noninvasive autopsies. 
t1_du8hifd	0	*	Holy shit I feel for you. Especially as a guy that has gotten several surgeries too. I hope you guys will get healthcare someday.
t1_du8gwhi	0	*	There's also the people who just cannot stomach it at all. Should they have to tough it out because they need to donate to receive?
t1_du8nvmf	1	*	I think it's one of those things where you had to be there
t1_du8kc73	0	*	We are at an impasse.
t1_du8n9pt	0	*	I mean he is technically correct, but I think it should be reduced by having less children not deciding not to donate. 
t1_du8fhyr	1	*	I think this is a nice parallel to the debate on abortion. Hence why I'm with you on this one.
t1_du8f87p	0	*	Not in the Netherlands. Kindsdeel.
t1_du8fm45	0	*	Ha, yeah.  You won't be needing these long.  What do you say?
t1_du8zden	1	*	My last wishes so everyone with a shred of morality

t1_du8e4pr	0	*	What are you on about?
t1_du8k69m	0	*	I don't think you grasp the concept of opting out. Oh well, you are entitled to your beliefs.
t1_du8vx9x	0	*	Unless they need an organ, at which point they are told to suffer and die. If healthcare is a right, it can't just end at a bandaid on the knee. Every need, no matter how expensive MUST be met.
t1_du8wm9e	0	*	Accidents happen.  U0001f604. Dad kinda chuckled.  I think we felt sorry for her for how bad she seemed to have felt.
t1_du8aadz	0	*	Can I turn this into a migration debate?
t1_du8hn4e	1	*	Not always

t1_du8ib6r	1	*	As I said, they ask it in public here when you get your drivers license.
t1_du8fidx	1	*	Yeah the abusive mother that ruined your life should decide if you could save another person or not. 
t1_du8tpkk	0	*	I can agree with that.  I think tho, that if you're not a donor, you should not be eligible for organ donations.  If people think that way, they think that way for everyone, not just for them.
t1_du8ilbf	1	*	I need to look this up as soon as have a spare moment. Don't have a will to begin with. 
t1_du92pbp	0	*	My condolences. It must be a very lonely existence to believe the best thing in it is yourself. 
t1_du912rv	1	*	Good point 
t1_du93tl1	0	*	I think you misread my comment, I fully support automatic opt in.
t1_du8fce4	0	*	You get to choose, that is correct. But if you do not choose, another makes a choice for you. The fact that you do not make a choice does not give another the right to make that choice for you.
t1_du8q6xh	0	*	On the bright side they don't have to worry about your life being extended if a transplant is needed. 
t1_du9cg4a	1	*	That might very well be the case. And then they will want you to sign for someone concious and alive. I typed it out on the other thread on this news.
t1_du93atm	0	*	Theres not. 
t1_duahejk	0	*	It is like the fear of death. Knowing may not make it easier. Everyone know death is coming yet tens of billions people is scared of it. 
t1_du8qlg2	1	*	It's the same in my state in the US too. Two different doctors have to declare you brain dead, and it takes at least 24 hours because they have to come separately 24 hours apart from each other 
t1_du8d2y4	0	*	Well, yeah. That's the problem - often there is a need for transfusion during transplantation. Fuck family for prioritizing religion over daughter's safety.
t1_du8mnoa	0	*	say that to misoprostol
t1_du8kdp9	1	*	Underrated. 
t1_du8hift	1	*	A house. A nice house too
t1_du9p5kh	1	*	I don't know if that has happened, but I imagine this type of article would make it easy for the masses to conjure up worse scenarios and then make their decision based off of that.
t1_du8py14	1	*	I'm not convinced, read [this](https://www.google.nl/amp/s/nos.nl/googleamp/artikel/2215702-wat-betekent-de-nieuwe-donorwet-voor-nabestaanden.html).
t1_du8gqrz	1	*	I *know* it's the right thing and I am - and will remain - a registered organ donor. I'm just saying that going in to all the gory detail of exactly how your organs are harvested is quite unsettling 
t1_du8lotg	0	*	theoretically yes, in practice we have social contracts that allow people to have personal freedom, though i don't think that this should excuse ones obligations towards society.
t1_du8lch9	0	*	So then should women who have had abortions be second rate citizens to women who haven't when it comes to giving birth?
t1_duamfl5	0	*	You can give all your money to charity- or you can study to be a doctor, or you can go serve in the army or become a policeman or a firefighter. Your argument just doesnt work- it picks and chooses.
t1_du8zey7	0	*	Because I dont want to be butchered
t1_du9l8fy	0	*	That's not a choice, though. A choice requires two options.
t1_du8klr0	1	*	Not just US. And let's not forget it was mainly because of Britain this whole mess started
t1_du8xjzp	1	*	That is exactly what I said. You will be asked, and if you don't answer, they will decide. 
t1_du8yzv9	1	*	In The Netherlands the maximum you would pay for any common surgery is 385 euro.   And you wouldn't believe it, people *still* complain about the costs (I worked for a health insurance company). 
t1_du8m60w	0	*	Why should parents have any say at all?
t1_du8smb3	1	*	Sure. 
t1_du8m6fl	0	*	Many others who value what happens to their bodies more.  I disagree with them, but it's not my body to do with as I choose.
t1_dt34q84	0	*	The fact that you don't follow Catholic dogma or don't believe it is theologically valid is irrelevant.  The fact is, millions of catholics believe in and follow dogma.
t1_dt3mqnv	0	*	pardon?   EDIT: Oh sure, you are right that someone's past guilt doesn't mean that they are *necessarily* guilty for all future accusations. No one's saying that.

t1_dtpjp25	0	*	Honestly its not a big deal. BBC gets funding by the British government, CBC gets funded in part by the Canadian government and nobody bats an eyelid. Russia does it and everyone goes insane.

t1_ds3xw15	0	*	Artillery striking impoverished peoples shows zero awareness for structural issues. You cant just bomb your way to a new society. 
t1_ds3u5gy	1	*	Ah, thanks for the clarification. I misread it.
t1_ds3mrbq	0	*	When all you have for a tool is an artillery shell suddenly everything starts looking like bombing targets
t1_ds3j5sv	1	*	Medicin is surprisingly hard to get and ols soviet era weaponry is surprisingly easy to get
t1_ds446fw	1	*	I'm loving all of these
t1_ds3iq78	0	*	They should breed and train Lions, killer bees, and Black Mambas to hunt down people who shoot at drones
t1_ds3yk54	1	*	Bombaclot?
t1_du3pbma	1	*	Sure come on over!
t1_du36ehz	1	*	haha there won't be a useable public transport in San Jose for next two decades. Just try to enjoy the traffic on 101.
t1_du369m5	1	*	So, you're saying we'll demolish all existing cities and rebuild them adopting this new smart growth philosophy?
t1_dv28qhf	0	*	What wizardry is this? What company in Australia is offering DSL and 4G on the same account?
t1_dv2fy99	1	*	Salesmen at one company are buyers at many others  Also, aren't pension contributions,etc invested in equities? 
t1_dv1rj1c	0	*	Tiny Timmy, edge master. 
t1_dtvf4h2	0	*	Indeed, there are way more humans then rhinos/lions/elephants/... , so the animals are obviously worth way more.
t1_dtvjxya	1	*	Killing a caged animal with a high-powered rifle isn't a show of strength - it's the weakest shit I can think of. I cannot understand how anyone would get off on that.
t1_dtvp44n	0	*	Have you not noticed how climate change was a fucking ACCIDENT?   Are you seriously that full of yourself?
t1_dtve9zo	0	*	What do the farm animals think on the way to or in the slaughterhouse? Oh no, not this again?
t1_dtvestq	0	*	License fees almost universally go to conservation. 
t1_dtw1s8k	0	*	I had the rationale that engaging in any argument with you would be a waste of time...
t1_dtvg5kj	1	*	You don't need meat to survive, and in fact, it's easy more environmentally friendly to be vegetarian or vegan than omnivore.  So all killing off animals is for fun.
t1_dtvmjzv	0	*	This old tired lie about how it boosts the economy. They've been doing this for how many years? How's the economy there still doing?   Fuck off
t1_dtvnjyb	0	*	Ok, I meant actually tracking/hunting wild deer (or any animal), vs. canned hunting (any animal).
t1_dtvj65a	0	*	Well I can tell you don't have an interest in hunting, otherwise you would know that deer is big game...
t1_dtvee07	0	*	And the dumb comparison has arrived
t1_dtvee4a	0	*	You went to Vietnam in 1993 to open up a sweatshop!
t1_dtwyjhx	1	*	I never said it was right because we liked it, you are the one who said it was wrong because people liked it, so I told you, why does it matter if they like it or not?
t1_dtwbv4z	0	*	So if you hold four reasonable opinions and one reprehensible one I should just shrug and act like it's all okay?  Fuck that. 
t1_dtvrfdw	0	*	Like? 
t1_dtvs2vq	1	*	The unspeakable stalking the inedible.   
t1_dtvgpuw	0	*	With nonsense but ok. I eagerly await your sermon. 
t1_dtxivav	1	*	The lion isn't endangered, if you read some of the posts above you could educate yourself on conservation
t1_dtvibqu	0	*	Do you think a child suffers more when killed by a billionaire with a high powered rifle or when killed by the slow bodily collapse brought on by cancer
t1_dtvgbnj	0	*	The purpose is it generates money for other things. A lot of hunting ventures funnel money back in to other conservation efforts.
t1_dtvetab	0	*	Some guy... They pay the conservation that helps protect and conserve the other lions to kill one. 
t1_dtwb4by	0	*	See this is exactly the sociopathic shit I was talking about
t1_dtvl61g	1	*	ah, whoops, you're right.  For some reason I only registered your first 2 sentences and immediately went to find out/remember the name of the short story
t1_dtwaw3c	1	*	Holy autism
t1_dtvox0a	0	*	So canned hunting = modern meat farming?
t1_dtvkxod	1	*	and is now dead mind you =P
t1_dtvvkww	1	*	How much have you donated to protecting wildlife?
t1_dtvtkjl	1	*	Also tanks.
t1_dtvio68	0	*	If we had to eat meat to survive Id agree with you but considering we dont, theyre both just killing for enjoyment. 
t1_dtvrl6o	0	*	Why is your love of the taste of meat so much better than the hunters love of hunting?
t1_dtvggo6	0	*	croatians?
t1_dtvexzx	0	*	I think people are confusing poachers with legally permitted hunters. 
t1_dtvmgm8	1	*	Would love screen in screen quit trollin
t1_dtvwqku	1	*	Pretty sure I heard it on an episode of Freakonomics Radio, which is usually pretty reliable and well researched. It's possible they were wrong though.
t1_dtw3lkw	0	*	Read my comment again dude...
t1_dtvkn0u	0	*	Aha! I already have admitted to what I am. 
t1_dtvmgyi	0	*	>(an escaped lion threatens someone, or you want to eat the cow for example)  How are these comparable justifications? One is self defense, and the other is killing for personal pleasure.
t1_dtvk639	0	*	Sure bud. Sure.  You're going to bring up a vegetarian?
t1_dtvltg7	1	*	> The part that hits me as fucked up is the time the farm raised lion spends in the wild confused and lost.  I know, I can't believe they let it out of its cage before slaughtering it. Barbaric.
t1_dtvfen4	0	*	Its in their best interest to put the money toward conservation as more lions means more money. Thats why this system works.
t1_dtvl427	1	*	Excellent. Fingers crossed. 
t1_dtvg93w	0	*	Glad to see you favour extinction over not hating people with money.  Bold.
t1_dtvf6j4	0	*	Is he? Life is life. Just because nature decided to put us on top doesn't mean everything is ours to play with. We have a responsibility as a sapient species and we consistently ignore it
t1_dtvgj65	0	*	 Not to the one being killed.
t1_dtvri54	0	*	The pleasure of *killing*.   Are we being serious here? Meat doesn't have *any* value other than taste?
t1_dtvylsb	0	*	Back at the derailing. Im not going vegan, I'm already a part of another religion. Sorry bruv. 
t1_dtwbnxk	0	*	I'm always in the mood to be educated. If you want to start with where you've gotten your education in wildlife conservation, I'd be happy to share research papers we've published on the subject? 
t1_dtxnu64	1	*	Yes, what's your favorite color? 
t1_dtw2362	1	*	That lion sure was a good shot. 
t1_dtxj5o0	1	*	Lol big man can't do it. 
t1_dtwfgqs	0	*	Well gee I guess going to college was useless! Glad you showed me..
t1_dtvjrwu	0	*	Still, they gotta pay to hunt in the preserve that would almost certainly be unmanaged or sold off to a company. Without hunters, those areas would have zero lions instead.
t1_dtw1y8o	0	*	You didn't answer my question.
t1_dtvfzhb	0	*	It's not like they cut the bulls neck muscles or stab spears into it's shoulders. The bull has the advantage is your argument?!
t1_dtvk2p7	1	*	Why not? there are billions of humans compared to the small numbers of endangered animals.  
t1_dtzvj0r	1	*	Oh.
t1_dtvev6i	0	*	Practically none. Sadly most gets caught up in corruption and the like. The conservation talk is mainly talk.
t1_du6p90u	0	*	I keep hearing this, but there is no genetic advantage to going sterile for aggressive males. For how many times I have seen that dragged out in this thread, I haven't seen a single source. 
t1_dtxtom5	0	*	> You can in fact eat things that aren't on the menu at McDonalds.  What a surprise, a conservative that only argues in strawmen.
t1_dtvd4bx	0	*	Doubtful. They've just got a different sense of moral than you do.
t1_dtvgd39	0	*	It was laziness. He could have released it a few miles away.
t1_dtvev1e	1	*	I killed fiddy men
t1_dtwl02k	1	*	True. 
t1_dtvog4k	0	*	My own? The EU heavily regulates the pratices and environment in which cattle grows, our regulations are very different. Probably not the best but it's the one I'm most familiar with
t1_dtvbokk	0	*	The teeth in our mouth?
t1_dtvfz93	0	*	Kind of like how it's ok to kill kids in India?
t1_dtvjx8f	0	*	Wanting to feel powerful isnt a mental illness. Its programmed into our DNA. Some power is a good thing for mental health.
t1_dtvfuoz	1	*	/r/thebullwins
t1_dtvgdow	0	*	Have you ever read The Jungle? Have you ever seen how chicken nuggets are made?  What they do in the food industry is by far worse than Canned Hunting.
t1_dtvclco	0	*	An entire game reserve?  [The Leeuwbosch Game Lodge area consists of 2600 hectare of kalahari bushveld.](http://www.leeuwbosch.co.za)  Hardly a cage. Wouldn't you agree?
t1_dtwq6eo	0	*	I love being lectured by people who think they know
t1_dtvvnwi	0	*	What you just said is a long way from saying human life isnt worth anything
t1_dtvc3rz	0	*	Then leave those who contribute even more alone. 
t1_dtvgmgp	0	*	Yet you eat meat. Shock.  Spending your dollars to have an animal killed for your selfish enjoyment.
t1_dtvjuwv	1	*	Yes, they get to live their whole lives smeared in shit crammed next to thousands of other animals. Much better
t1_dtvco46	1	*	The only peer-reviewed study returned in your search is behind a paywall.
t1_dtvqx8s	1	*	Have you learned nothing during your time on Reddit? It doesn't matter if you are right or wrong. No one on reddit will let you win an argument.
t1_dtve6ri	1	*	And who exactly is going to pay for that?
t1_dtveolf	1	*	Only if the animals are killed where they were raised.. 
t1_dtvovd6	0	*	too many ifs
t1_dtvnok2	1	*	Or stop at Horus Rising and everything is fine and not traumatic...
t1_dtvx68y	1	*	Yeah I don't wear them, I'm a Simms whore
t1_dtve9sq	0	*	Who pays for that? A lot of talk in this thread, not a lot of real life solutions. 
t1_dtvo560	0	*	Please elaborate on this. The overkill hypothesis is widely disputed and science points to climate change not caused by humans as the reason why large mammals died off in North America.
t1_dtw1hc7	1	*	You can reduce the damage of eating meat, but your use of electronics is covering the world in acid and your impacts are still there. You're just making an appeal to your life style. 
t1_dtvgeq1	0	*	Why?
t1_dtvj7v2	0	*	When you dont understand an argument so you start talking about rape. Good work there mate. 
t1_dtvdwyi	0	*	lol. have you ever been in croatia?
t1_dtvmrre	1	*	>  And that is the real problem.  I'm trying to see the problem. You've described the situation, but where does it present a problem? 
t1_dtvtr2y	0	*	Neither do I, but it's not the same as killing just for the hell of it.
t1_dtvfcfb	0	*	Yes, the [Macdonald Triad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macdonald_triad) - it wouldn't surprise me if the Trump boys were bed-wetters too...
t1_dtvfw7g	0	*	It looks like both. I know a lot of people who shoot BB guns at random birds. Not everyone loves animals like how Reddit does (which can be sometimes be more extreme in how they love animals)
t1_dtvyps3	1	*	He absolutely had a reason.   Edit: not saying the reason was good but he didnt go there to shot it and let it rot.
t1_dtxvhi4	1	*	For whatever it's worth, it wasn't me. I asked a question; you answered. Thanks. 
t1_dtvblq2	0	*	It pretty much is. Unless you believe this in ALL instances where money is involved. Wich is also silly. 
t1_dtvdkt3	1	*	We don't need to eat meat we just like the taste. Same difference really. 
t1_dtvls7h	1	*	Couldn't agree more. Glad somebody with some actual rational comparisons showed up.
t1_dtvogzp	0	*	they do that out of instinct, its not like they can evaluate their own actions
t1_dtvrj64	1	*	Trophy hunting is a huge economic boon for poorer communities. 
t1_dtveh75	1	*	Respectibility is the same
t1_dtvobto	1	*	Morality is obviously subjective. My two reasons are more than enough for me to consider canned hunting immoral. I cant speak for you. 
t1_dtvefv4	1	*	>Hell, I can guess your political predilections just by the fact that you tried to throw in something vaguely resembling evolutionary psychology in a discussion where it has no place.
t1_dtvghd2	0	*	What's wrong with the croats?!
t1_dtvnowj	1	*	They probably do. And if not then the locals will. Noone (especially in poorer countries) is going to just leave all that protein to rot. 
t1_dtvihoa	1	*	By definition, poaching is illegal. It is the illegal hunting of animals. All poachers are criminals, and are also shitfaces.
t1_dtvbooi	1	*	>the majority are at least partly illictly run  Source?
t1_dtvhkc3	1	*	>i know this is a joke  Thank youU0001f618
t1_dtvj6j8	0	*	They made their choice the second they got cancer, now let's gather up the hunting party and sign some donation cheques!
t1_dtvs31l	0	*	Interesting, I'm usually disappointed when I expect good arguments from people that describe hunters as bloodthirsty, gun-toting republicans
t1_dtvotvr	0	*	Amongst other animals. 
t1_dtvhoud	1	*	Nope sorry, he deserved his fate and the world is slightly better without him. 
t1_dtvcady	0	*	what do you mean by exceptions
t1_dtwqmot	0	*	It surprises me as well. Too many people only consider their own family and friends lives as valuable. I think it explains most the issues we have in the world I think.
t1_dtzsq44	1	*	thatsthepoint.jpeg
t1_dtvea39	1	*	Projection is a terrible thing.  
t1_dtvfgck	1	*	We are talking about animals that need to be destroyed or removed    Those words are used in conservation. 
t1_dtvi0zt	0	*	This guy fucks 
t1_dtvihkf	0	*	So because you cant justify your position youre going to try and shift it once more.  Hilarious.  
t1_dtvqhhr	0	*	>Vegans generally have an adequate iron intake and do not experience anemia more frequently than others.  Apparently not that big.
t1_dtxih2d	1	*	Exactly, it's the human thing to do /s
t1_dtveenr	1	*	Walgreens is a convenience store chain in the US.
t1_dtvpa2u	0	*	Could just be he wanted to go and do it himself. I do think people who eat meat then proceed to complain about hunters are quite hypocritical. 
t1_dtvfn9l	1	*	Canned hunts yes. Real hunting is different from personal experience.
t1_dtvedp4	1	*	It's conservation as in preservation of the killed animals as trophies. ^/s
t1_dtvdlpq	1	*	Oh, I signed up old Billy on the list because he's kept trying to fuck dead gazelles and jesus I didn't want to see that for the 24th time. 
t1_dtvfft9	0	*	I'm sure you're a vegetarian, correct?
t1_dtvjmp1	0	*	Not at all, poachers sell their hunts. Like it or not, hunters help sustain these animals because its a business to ensure that there ARE animals to hunt. The problem is poachers not hunters. 
t1_dtvur50	1	*	And you have the legal right to do so. However if does make you no ethically different from the lion hunters.
t1_dtvtvqc	1	*	Hey, don't insult my baseball mitt like that.
t1_dtven6w	1	*	Killing the chicken is for profit.  
t1_dtvkjfl	1	*	Ignore this dude. He's just making personal attacks.
t1_dtvmiie	0	*	Whatever you do with his remains makes no difference to the dead animal. 
t1_dtvfhkg	0	*	Eating is a necessity, but killing a chicken to eat isn't.
t1_dtve3yu	0	*	And the personality of the person who eats meat because it's tasty?. Whoa completely different. 
t1_dtvada7	1	*	> but just wishing things were different wouldn't accomplish much.  I said that for a reason.   Saying what you want to happen is useless if you don't have a way to make it actually happen.
t1_dtvrwbs	1	*	Thats like saying it is more fucked up to kill a human being who was a free person, than to kill a slave, because slave life is all they have known and have no confusion before they are murdered.
t1_dtvj1rg	1	*	Makes more sense. It spun him around 57 times and left him 106.5 deg away from his initial point of view.
t1_dtvyau2	1	*	Ok cool. Well just let this conversation do its thing. 
t1_dtvmg82	1	*	We could grant animals the right to not be hunted. Rights are just made up rules, after all.
t1_dtvddd0	0	*	Money will do that to you. 
t1_dtvlcl5	0	*	That may be true for the US. However, soy is fed to cattle in many other places in the world. Soy farms in South America mainly go toward feeding cattle (or other livestock).
t1_dtvi24p	1	*	If I had to care about everything I eat, I would live a miserable life.
t1_dtvcdz0	1	*	Hahaha nice getting to know you
t1_dtvl5hb	1	*	Incredible how many rich people are mentally ill
t1_dtvblu7	0	*	By usually he means if done ethically.
t1_dtvefim	1	*	Probably poor.
t1_dtvf0os	0	*	You know you dont have to eat cattle that has been grouped together in tiny spaces and slaughtered inhumanely to survive, right fam? You eat meat because you enjoy it, i.e fun.
t1_dtve3ln	0	*	Ol Hairy heres a soldier. 
t1_dtvqyuu	0	*	what about just the novelty of having shot a lion?
t1_dtvqrwy	0	*	It's not like we changed the climate on purpose, and it's not like it's changing for the better
t1_dtvq46c	0	*	most of the money doesnt go to conservation   http://www.ecolarge.com/work/the-200-million-question-how-much-does-trophy-hunting-really-contribute-to-african-communities/
t1_dtvh941	1	*	Only one of our current generations wants the government to compel speech.
t1_dtvipj9	0	*	You dont need to eat meat, though. Either way the animal is being killed for someones enjoyment, not necessity. 
t1_dtvqtie	1	*	Well said
t1_dtt75gq	1	*	Considering that ability to feel empathy is a typical characteristic of the most successful species in the history of the planet, namely us, you are way, way off in your views.
t1_ds3mtas	0	*	No wonder Trump, a white supremacist, is POTUS.

t1_du76k8i	1	*	Your an idiot
t1_du7tgxm	0	*	I dont know anyone who would value Nazi Germany, Saudi Arabia and North Korea at the same level as Norway or Sweden.   They arent all equal. 
t1_dtjtjjs	1	*	Not in sweden
t1_dtmhn48	1	*	Cop....OUT. I will believe what I see, the next time I go to UK and shake my head at how sucky everything has become (for anyone that actually leaves central london).
t1_dtaw4c5	0	*	>BTW do you even know what that little black spot in bird shit is?  That's their feces.  The white part is their urine.  In an effort to become lighter, they evolved away their bladder.  
t1_du5otzc	0	*	I want you to be happy. Please.
t1_duvaxnw	1	*	Don't remind me.
t1_duva9i8	1	*	Poo creates short term problems, plastic creates short and long term problems.
t1_duvo9wj	1	*	I saw that shared and dismissed it as fake news right away. I'm glad I didn't waste the time watching it.
t1_duvg1dn	0	*	Does plastic disappear in 70-100 years, or just break up into a bunch of tiny plastic particles that are much harder to clean up?
t1_duv6hf3	0	*	You scrub shit? What use is a polished turd?
t1_duvcfwr	0	*	The soil is kind of ruined though. Its fine since its on the tracks, but with water runoff, the soil will spread. Look up night soil.
t1_duv9a2m	0	*	I'd imagine a rail workers life in India isn't as glamorous as say a Europeans.

t1_duvoc2n	0	*	Not anymore, there may still be some old ones but the word 'many' is out of place.
t1_duv9n0b	1	*	*Human feces everywhere.
t1_duvheql	0	*	I have a fraternity brother of mine who I respect a lot. He and I disagree on most issues but we both agree on protecting environment, mainly because we all have to live here. Also trees are pretty.
t1_duvf3wq	0	*	> Sound
t1_duvr6uw	1	*	But that's their point. People didn't have to give a shit about the environment because everything would decay over time.
t1_duv9zrk	0	*	In Algeria they've lined some of the roads along the sahara with beer bottles.  Genius, if you ask me.
t1_duv6re9	0	*	Yup, Italy too.

t1_duw2cgq	1	*	Right?! Perfect vid. The cigarette ash in the BMW was especially awesome, that'll stink the car up for ages
t1_duwf7fr	1	*	GiliT was very clean when I was there. Only issue was they had just demolished all illegal beach houses so that was a bit of a mess. But very little trash as far as I could see.
t1_duvxo0v	1	*	Its a common phrase here in Canada.  Not sure about elsewhere.
t1_duvk5hs	1	*	While in the wilderness, if you bury your shit away from waterways there's no issue. Just don't shit in the water.

t1_dsi2a0v	0	*	I get what you're getting at but my point is that *the whole country's doctors aren't raping women* in the US.
t1_dshqnst	0	*	That is an epistemological issue, not a science one. You cant force someone to accept your truth, not matter how well reasoned.
t1_dshnj1g	1	*	so... we agree, it IS a problem the whole world is currently guilty of!    But also agree, it's worse in India
t1_dsifaj5	1	*	Then by India's standards, you should have room for another one, you treacherous whore.
t1_dshay9t	1	*	oh wow didn't realize you were downvoted so heavily. I was responding in agreement FWIW
t1_dtjc8uc	1	*	K.   Move along now

t1_duqbbf6	0	*	God could you imagine if Arabs controlled America? No bueno.
t1_duqepr4	1	*	He's referring to Arab and Muslim countries. It's one thing not to read the source, but the information is literally in the page name.
t1_du5zboq	0	*	that is why Justin admires the basic dictatorship of China  many Canadians are hoping for this model since elections will produce results they disagree with.  
t1_dsm0ux6	0	*	Ok are you for the estate tax then?
t1_dsm0tj0	0	*	Why?
t1_dsm4hkf	1	*	I don't even understand how people can equate using rough language with being willing to sacrifice millions in a war with Mexico.
t1_dsll6lg	0	*	again, completely insane = crazy fucking stupid
t1_dsks7sm	0	*	The truth making you uncomfortable?
t1_dsl4n4h	1	*	http://web.mit.edu/humancostiraq/HOW%20MANY%20DIED,%20BUSH.html  About 800,000 to 1.3 million by 2009. So no.
t1_dsl7259	1	*	Are you high as fuck or something? You clearly can't even keep your conversations straight.
t1_dsl912q	1	*	That I agree with yes. The housing market fiasco is certainly on his administration...although the extremely low interest rates post 2000 certainly played their part.
t1_dsl9ys7	1	*	California actually https://www.dirt-to-dinner.com/where-do-our-fruits-and-vegetables-come-from/
t1_dsl3uk5	0	*	For the US economy it is
t1_du6rdhv	1	*	>There's only one reason their word is law,  it's because that's what's written in the UN Charter.  North Korea willingly joined.
t1_du6ln5c	0	*	are you serious? It technically is.  
t1_du66u3q	1	*	well give it a few more years, we're only 18 years in

t1_dskimc3	0	*	So what Clusterbombs already do, but with less payload, less range and probably 10 times the cost?
t1_dsjfcev	1	*	Use gas; drop containers into a crowd on a windy day. Be my guess.
t1_dsk8x4k	1	*	Just have privates run around with pool nets, that'd work. 
t1_dsju5jq	0	*	Drones don't mean quads you know. It would be far more effective to use plane platforms for weapons delivery drones. Like the picture in the article shows.
t1_dsjhqqr	0	*	Same here, cant get enough of them and Fahrenheit 451 was one of my first. Love that book. :) 
t1_dsjh1h3	1	*	Tiny cruise missiles are cruise missiles. 
t1_dsjeej6	1	*	but they can't. 
t1_dskj1jw	1	*	Ah, almost any human - you're not thinking about the Flash.
t1_dskqfmd	1	*	Woah, slow down there Zapp
t1_dskaf70	1	*	If you want them to actually hit the target, they're not going to be dirt cheap, since now instead of 1 guidance/navigation system you need X, and they have to be much smaller. 
t1_dskioi7	1	*	Nope, and that's even before you account for the fact that it's virtually impossible to make them hit the exact same spot at the exact same time.
t1_dsjiwcn	1	*	Yeah there is no evidence he said it, googled it right after.
t1_dsjk2os	0	*	In defense this is also in part due to the fact that tactical nuclear weapons in the scale you're talking about are a terrible Idea.
t1_dsjwr2x	0	*	Someone in the field correct me if I'm wrong, but I suspect that collision avoidance at 80 mph in an obstacle rich environment would be highly nontrivial. Especially if your drones aren't networked.
t1_dse1xmt	0	*	The study of atomic and subatomic particles is not quantum mechanics?
t1_duoayab	0	*	Yup, no such thing as a perfect leader.  I worry about Trudeau because the media's just too in love with him.  In any case, so far so good...
t1_duo33k2	0	*	Yeah it's a big issue. I think that things like Twitter are good because anybody can be a journalist and we can get our news directly from the source
t1_duo5n6a	0	*	Irrelevant. The people picked their person but it didn't matter. 
t1_dunz14u	1	*	Then they need to stop generalizing. 
t1_dunx7zx	0	*	So what's your definition of a concentration camp? 
t1_dunoeoy	0	*	Yes...otherwise why would Trump have won?  In fact, I'd argue that Trump's entire campaign and Presidency has been about attacking people. Your logic suggest that he should have lost by a landslide. 
t1_duoelpq	1	*	No you don't, just as it was changed before it can be changed again. 
t1_dunk4lg	0	*	Idk what you mean by developed past that. What is your point of reference?
t1_dunyalv	0	*	And that'd be fine if the DNC actually played an impartial role during the primary. 
t1_duog0ek	1	*	Yeah, the army or ISIS doesnt care about inclusivity.
t1_dunr74z	0	*	Trump's policies favor the workers over the rich. Specifically immigration and trade. Being rich doesn't mean you are pro-rich. 
t1_dunxfnp	0	*	The people who are paying for it. 
t1_duntb75	0	*	I think what he is saying is that while trump may not have authorized or re authorized surveillance policies, he hasn't done anything to stop the eroding of privacy either. 
t1_duo4f9e	1	*	I never called it propaganda, I cant control what people say on my comment lol.  I just said hey maybe this isnt that accurate
t1_dunpj6g	0	*	I think [the James Damore case](https://gizmodo.com/exclusive-heres-the-full-10-page-anti-diversity-screed-1797564320) is a good example.  
t1_dunlcbk	0	*	A world where everyone agrees is hell. A world where everyone respects each other sounds more utopian to me. 
t1_dupmrod	0	*	Then why were you saying that it was just American liberals? You never implied that it was anyone other than them.
t1_duobwwi	1	*	Then they fully deserve to arrested and deported. Wanting legal immigration isn't xenophobic. 
t1_dunu6i9	0	*	If Republicans wanted them to be permanent, they would be permanent.  They didn't want them to be permanent
t1_dupm8ke	1	*	Thank you for the words of support. It's pretty disenfranchising to see people agree with someone who is clearly just repeating falsehoods.  
t1_duo83s0	0	*	Just because someone said something false in a movie doesn't make it *correct* now. Truth is more important than pop culture references...
t1_dunn1xa	0	*	Not you, people in general. Its usually either black or white, with no regards for good things that shit people can and sometimes do.
t1_duo9p7r	0	*	Are you referring to the Democratic primary or the 2016 contest between Clinton and trump?
t1_dunqa6b	0	*	I know but I always wonder about how they rationalise to themselves, like I couldn't convince myself I was right if I had literally no evidence when someone asked me.
t1_dunmioh	0	*	You thought wrong 
t1_dunpkfl	0	*	Wrong response?   I said GOP donors. 
t1_dunnwmq	1	*	I don't think you know what the term free press means....  You seem to think free press is anything that aligns with your worldview.
t1_duq7h8g	0	*	Again while I disagree with deporting them, that is not considered a human right. 
t1_dunpiy0	1	*	Remember Reagan's idea of don't tax the rich, they will invest it into the economy then? And how well it has worked out? 
t1_dunyms9	0	*	Yeah, it's that easy. so why isn't the current guy doing it
t1_duo9bua	1	*	> Now you know not to trust politicians. Join the club.  Surely you mean Now you know not to expect immediate results from the actions that politicians take, right?
t1_duno0nk	0	*	Of course only people with proper paperwork have human rights.
t1_dunt46f	0	*	> data scientist  So you troll on the internet for a living then.
t1_duo217d	1	*	Again, I stand by my post.  I had issues with the above things too, but again 90+% of others are guilty of the same sins.
t1_dunujyr	1	*	Those aren't the only talking points of liberalism, not even close
t1_dunlylq	1	*	There are plenty of disgruntled people, but then there are disgruntled people everywhere. China is no worse nor better.   But this whole Death Squad thing puzzle the hell out of me. 
t1_dunsq1r	0	*	We're on the same side here. I think I misread what you said originally.
t1_dup3wiq	1	*	Beijing air has been pretty clean for the past few months already. 
t1_dunncfd	1	*	> It has developed past that point  Think this might have had something to do with all the people with guns?
t1_duofq1a	0	*	> So instead of promoting someone that would represent the base, that the base chose, they forced her in  The base voted for Clinton. By a significant margin.
t1_dunkeh9	0	*	If one of the things you disagree on is the fact that you think he should be deported,  then yes, it means he should probably hate you despite your shared fondness for cookies.
t1_duo8k1m	1	*	Sure is. That doesn't make it true. 
t1_dunuvpy	0	*	hmm well I'd say I'm fiscally conservative but socially very liberal. the problems are bad but their causes...their causes are very good
t1_dunq4p4	1	*	Thats why they are called the Alternative SJWs or Social Injustice Warriors. They are now more prevelant than the SJW left
t1_dunr5fw	0	*	If being against fascism is all that you are about then you've placed the bar equal, or if we're generous, slightly above their level. That's a very low fucking standard to apply to yourself.   
t1_dunsame	0	*	?? Yeah exactly, they attack people if they say something they dont like 
t1_dunt1ja	1	*	People also thought that world war one was the war to end all wars.  That humans would never be capable of such atrocities again.  That we had progressed past that point. 
t1_dunvyb9	1	*	Has it been settled since the patriot act still exists?
t1_duoqc2a	0	*	Yes, it is one constitution.  There are no quotes needed.        In stark contrast to a nation like France, for example.  I believe they are on their 5th republic, no?  
t1_duo2oqz	1	*	I was talking about the no fly zone in Syria, which would've definitely caused some problems.
t1_dunwydn	0	*	Post proof that these murders were ordered by Joe Arpaio and I will admit fault.   
t1_dunx0xh	0	*	If no one died/ were executed, should it really be called a concentration camp? 
t1_duno9qd	1	*	Are you referring to current conservatism? Because again, that focuses on an in-group and screws others over as well.
t1_dunlmcf	0	*	> data scientiest  lol
t1_dunmjn1	0	*	> I did give you evidence. Just read how the news is reported. As I said, if we had free press, it would be far more diverse than it is now.  Your opinion isn't evidence. All other things aside. 
t1_dupc9j6	0	*	Being a sarcastic prick won't win you many friends in life.
t1_duqzs4p	0	*	You can take it at his word, or you can take it by what it is. A policy.   A well defined policy.
t1_dunp1wp	1	*	 thanks
t1_duns7f6	1	*	Every time you make a typo, the errorists win.
t1_duntloh	1	*	Saving this for updates on a delusional argument..

t1_dunyf6t	0	*	So no he's not a liar or no that 'brash NY salesman' isn't code for lying?
t1_dunofb2	0	*	Til Free Press = what I think is truth.

t1_duu7pay	1	*	lmao or just choose them because they're black and speak good
t1_dsfk0r4	1	*	Unfortunately that's how your democracy works. FPP always turns into a two-horse race, and neither of the horses in the race are interested in allowing a third horse to enter.
t1_dsklg0q	1	*	Yes.  I am saying that you presented it as a problem that isnt being taken into account. It is, C02 is a shorthand that most people understand. 
t1_du72k99	1	*	Wow, that's the SECOND McGuffin you are trying to switch up on us during this really enlightening thread you started.... focus, kid, try to stay on topic.
t1_dtujn0n	0	*	And its 0% on this topic, dipshit.
t1_dtt7eyf	0	*	And? He ran on repairing relations with Russia. Why wouldn't he?
t1_dtt9ffw	0	*	Who cares about 'scores' and the reddit hive mind mate? & I'm not hiding them, reddit does that automatically. You been here 4 years and didn't realise?
t1_dtt9z5g	0	*	I didn't realize they had numerous manmade war islands in the middle of the ocean (far from coast). Crazy stuff. Thought this was their first.

t1_dtt5cfx	1	*	For the time being...but change is inevitable.
t1_due2xdc	1	*	I guess they kind of are if you take in to account that our hands grow extra layers of skin to toughen them and our pores all pick up bacteria
t1_dtyia0w	0	*	Never said that. Was just saying it is not a super common thing to see happen as a citizen. Which was the argument
t1_du2zs64	1	*	Poor misunderstood Iran. They only wanted to say Israel is a cancerous tumor and shouldn't exist and won't survive. Such poor souls. Clearly what they meant is that everyone gets a round of hugs.
t1_du3h48w	1	*	> Life expectancy, health and education have all massively increased since then  I am pretty sure it has for almost all nations since 19179, just sayin
t1_duso9dz	1	*	> This is your brain on America.
t1_dut7xdg	1	*	It really sounds nothing like that. If you want to bury your head in the sand, that's fine. But please stfu while you're doing it. You have nothing to add to this conversation.
t1_du32747	0	*	I meant by 1948, my apologies
t1_duy8j4g	1	*	I think what he's saying is that he doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about.  Let's just go with that.
t1_dtliplc	0	*	Seems more like a an ill-informed answer than an attempt at humor. I could easily see someone thinking this.
t1_du2w5wl	1	*	Ah yes, trying to smash someone's skull in with a bike lock because he was an *alleged NAZI* is self defense.
t1_du306xx	0	*	You immediately bring in race. Why?
t1_du2talu	1	*	> or atracked non-White people in trains?  Why does the skin colour matter?
t1_du4gsic	0	*	I didnt say they had it easy, I said they had it easy compared to other European nations i.e. Poland.  Reading comprehension bro

t1_du3cawx	1	*	I was joking
t1_du23hma	0	*	You're welcome but don't feel bad, its a very common confusion.  Its always good to learn from each other.
t1_du1z9al	0	*	If I sell drugs or work 90 hours a week yeah!
t1_dt2zqee	0	*	Call it null and void or with no legal validity, as all those resolutions choose to word it, if you are into semantics. Right of conquest is over. Simple as that.
t1_dt5vk0h	1	*	The answer reads just fine. It's politics, not counting gum balls. Set up shop on the top of Mount Everest if you like, but then don't get upset if nobody comes calling.
t1_dt32eop	0	*	Then if indeed pence is moving an embassy to bring on the end times I would be very interested in evidence that this is his line of thinking.
t1_dt2okp5	0	*	I don't have the answer to that. Once again, I do not agree with it, but in response to your original comment, there are maps on this planet that have Tel Aviv listed as Israel's capital.
t1_dt4p4mu	0	*	Oh and, that wiki page has some other false information in it, there is no Palestinian State yet, because well, according to you, the whole world needs to recognize it, and it hadn't. 
t1_dtti855	1	*	The younger ones are marching in Nazi rallies.
t1_dtudjq5	0	*	Of course everyone should receive the same quality of healthcare. Otherwise it's not healthcare it's shit.
t1_dtu1o9v	0	*	Ohhh.....  My condolences...  Sorry for bringing up painful memories...  ...  Sorry....
t1_dtwp7jz	1	*	To be fair as an Aussie most of the Americans I've met have been overflowing with empathy. Almost too much. I think the American condition is one of extremes perhaps.

t1_dtu63yu	0	*	It's sold to debt collectors for pennies on the dollar, so hostpitals are usually willing to negotiate if they think it will come to that.
t1_dttawnz	0	*	As a non-american, I really can't understand why *anyone* would want such a horrible healthcare system.
t1_dttcfs8	0	*	Payroll taxes are taxes on workers, not on companies.  The tax is directly tied to you and your income.  Just because you don't see the tax on your check doesn't mean it's not there
t1_dttg33i	0	*	I know this well. It wasn't so bad a few years back when you could still get noodles for 6p and bread for 40p, now it's all double. Good luck going forward. It's good to see people helping out.
t1_dttd7zd	1	*	Oh absolutely, but overall they are left of centre I would say (mainly for their social liberalism than their economic)
t1_dttl5qs	0	*	Whoops! Noted: I forgot it.  But I'll leave it as it is to remember people grammar is important. Like a balanced breakfast!

t1_dttn2td	1	*	I can't believe insurance companies think like that. Man, shit's fucked.
t1_dttt1mi	1	*	Im sure it feels like bashing, but for the many Americans suffering in this setup, its more positive support for changing a bad situation. 
t1_dttf5uv	0	*	Sure.  A HealthCare SYSTEM.  Different than healthcare.
t1_dttwmyc	1	*	Gas crisis, inflexible labor unions and poor leadership from Democrats all played a part. Both sides had roles in it.
t1_dttg57k	0	*	That sounds difficult you can just have my upvote back.
t1_dttb3kc	0	*	We just had a kid and the bill before insurance was 18k for 3 days. $1100 out of pocket deductible is what we ended up paying.
t1_dttfkod	0	*	Wow. Well.... Shit.   I was replying to a Canada person but do you think that, as bad as that all sounds, do you think it's better in Australia than what Americans without insurance have to go thru? 
t1_dttinzo	0	*	Oh there will be plenty of shit eating when you try. Take my word for it.

t1_dttas36	0	*	If that's the treatment you got in the ER, you actually didn't need to go to the ER. I transport people like you all the time in my ambulance. They're only charged $350 though.

t1_dttkf4l	0	*	I wouldn't say that's accurate either
t1_dttbex6	0	*	Britain is the same. Does Canada have the massive issues where someone is on the lower end of a tax bracket? 
t1_dtthrf4	0	*	How does this view remain pervasive in the light of overwhelming evidence the contrary though?
t1_dttuvn2	0	*	The surgery cost 14,000 up front. I didn't have 14,000 because I was fucking 16 years old. 
t1_dttih43	0	*	Wages would be nice. I am in a semi skilled role in a NHS that comes with a lit of responsibility and I could make more stacking shelves at tesco.
t1_dttcwe3	0	*	Then why do they do it? Not sure who to ask. 
t1_dtthhdd	0	*	They can actually, not all treatment is covered. Not quite the same, but there are limits to what they will do (and that is fine).
t1_dttbytc	0	*	It was Bieber all along. The only true American.
t1_dttawjs	0	*	Hillary is what an American Republican should be: center-right.  American politics are fucked up and Democrats are right/center-right and Republicans are far-right.
t1_dubn8qv	1	*	Yes, of course you don't. How convenient to just boo-hoo something when it does not further your narrative.

t1_dttudws	0	*	That problem can still be fixed immediately by reducing military spending. Why are we able to go into debt for military spending but not medical? 
t1_dttdufj	1	*	Because less people live there, so the decision affects less people.
t1_dttgtiz	0	*	> Charlie Gards parents RAISED millions to fund his treatment through willing donations.   I don't see your point. Occasionally charitable donations will fund someone's treatment. The issues remain.

t1_dttchz9	1	*	It's not that I disagree with you or the guy I responded to, but everyone has their own view of our different (defunct) systems.  Media is an incredibly powerful tool.

t1_dtdpkev	1	*	You should have stayed quiet now the poorly guided rage of Reddit has fallen onto your shoulders 
t1_dtdxcm7	0	*	In what way is Trump trying to clean this up?
t1_dte1sg2	0	*	That is not violent, it is just the threat of violence
t1_dtehs6m	1	*	I was mostly just making a really bad joke about a lot of cops being racist and conservative, I obviously don't hold those sorts of beliefs. I went ahead and deleted it, though.
t1_dtduch5	1	*	Well it at least made the far right show thier true colors
t1_dte8xtj	0	*	>Shit happens. Don't judge.  Nah, I rather open discussions and personal responsibility for ones choice of actions.

t1_dtdtzte	0	*	Yeah and may even be more fit for office than that senior citizen with Cheeto dust tan.
t1_dtdwqqr	0	*	The problem is that shit *is* legal, but it's nonetheless a really underhanded and cheap tactic to get ahead in an election.
t1_dtdud9l	1	*	Just shows the delineation between law and morality.
t1_dtebwna	1	*	She was overqualified for the job. Just like hiring cops.
t1_dtfb5qg	1	*	Of course. All Russians are equal, some are just MORE equal.

t1_dte19ak	0	*	With a 90% approval rating any form of democracy is going to have Putin voted in.
t1_dtdvru5	0	*	Leave it to the Brits to take a simple term like public school and completely bungle it!  (Just kidding, much love from the States and thanks for the explanation!)
t1_dtdwss7	0	*	Funny considering Trump won the white college educated vote. Keep being naive though. 
t1_dtdnc73	0	*	You done poked the beehive son 
t1_dte2uao	0	*	Just keep your head down until it's your turn to get killed by a cop.  And this is why no one should ever trust cop apologists and other authoritarians. No backbone.
t1_dtdx62g	0	*	This is too hard. I'm just gonna watch cable news. 
t1_dtei640	1	*	Define 'very successful'. Because if you're wanting to become like Google, Dyson, General Electrics or Royal Shell, you need to be hella corrupt.
t1_dte3f66	0	*	This bot *legit* shows sources of both sides?   You aren't supposed to get spoon-fed. Read both sides. Make a decision based on your take on it. 
t1_dtdu4g9	1	*	Slamming him with informed hatred while studying how the dipshit made it into office can be done simultaneously. 
t1_dtdzrir	0	*	No conscious, honest, sentient human could possibly still think this.

t1_dsu7uob	0	*	Motives matter, my opinion of someones motives to commit a crime, does not matter.   The intentions do not justify the crime.
t1_dsoeh5n	0	*	Its quite obvious that you do not see the generalization in the comment. So the argument will go nowhere. The way you interpret a generalization and the way I do are considerably different. 
t1_dunpbxm	0	*	The official category would be speeches, remarks, and comments, but yes he did. 
t1_dt4ls4o	1	*	But are you really surprised?  Im not, they (people from the_douche or r/debatefascism) literally make these type of justifications all the time. Scumbags.
t1_dt4esqa	1	*	Thats literally what youre doing with the car example. You said they condoned the driver and not condemned him 
t1_dt8naim	0	*	I've studied psychology, physical therapy, and I'm getting my degree in marketing next year. I would say as pretentious as it sounds, I have more experiences than my professor(s) for the most part. 
t1_dt4kv7x	1	*	Spoiler Alert: He cant.  That's why white genocide =  diversity, according to them. because actual ethnic cleansing of white people doesnt exist.
t1_dt5vbmi	1	*	Faked as in, the guy accused of it was in all likelyhood innocent as can  be. Staged is the better term.
t1_dt61f9d	0	*	Lol you just can't accept that these people exist because it goes against your narrative
t1_dt4flvu	0	*	And you continue to prove the point by using a single person to paint an ideological group. Proving my point futher

t1_dt4ui8c	1	*	That's actually kinda funny, haha. +1
t1_du72oey	1	*	Someone said confidently on the internet once that of a US carrier were sunk, the US might go for a nuclear response.  
t1_dsuqezm	0	*	Her cousin got shot in the head a little earlier of her slapping the soldier. I'll say that's a armed attack.

t1_dsu3oqt	0	*	Whoever can enforce their laws is the one whos laws are followed. Aka the guy with the bigger stick makes the rules. 
t1_dsukz0l	1	*	I could also say its been 1500 years of uninvited arab colonists. Although I wont refer to palestinians as colonists.
t1_dsuusnk	0	*	ISIS are terrorists so no as even the government troops kill them. But if the Syrian Army attacked and killed American soldiers illegally in their country then they would be justified in doing so. 
t1_dsucs8c	0	*	The ONLY reason its not sovereign is because Israel shoots dead any Palestinian who attempts to exercise sovereignty over their own territory. 
t1_dsv2y3p	1	*	Add Yemen to the list.   US Spec OPS has been running night ops in Yemen for years.
t1_dsu0b72	1	*	Nah. I'm gonna leave it.
t1_dsxbgzf	1	*	Not if you started the war, which Israel did. 
t1_dsxk9oo	0	*	Yes, I surely would, but under the present circumstances, I doubt that presenting said evidence *to you* would be worth the time invested.
t1_dsxblrk	0	*	Care to provide a source for an instance like that?
t1_dsuaa1p	0	*	The West Bank is not Israel. The soldiers were outside the state of Israel.

t1_dsv3yqq	0	*	Settling isnt a pejorative.. youre a settler too.   Why do you live where you do? Is there some sinister motive behind your choice?
t1_dsyriqd	0	*	It gives her the moral right to defend herself.  She has every right to do so.
t1_dsuqr4n	1	*	Please don't comment if you are ignorant.
t1_dsukoh4	0	*	There is no right to be a terrorist. There is a right to resist occupation. You don't get to take away a nation's rights just because you brand them all terrorists. Have some shame dude.

t1_duhav54	1	*	Feeling is mutual
t1_ds99db8	1	*	? America has been powerful since WWII. That's got nothing to do with Trump. What he's done (along with his voters) is lose all of its credibility.
t1_dsbkg3n	1	*	That is actually correct. Altruism by some definitions does not exist.   https://idealution.wordpress.com/2011/07/29/why-absolute-selfless-altruism-does-not-exist/  
t1_ds9wlon	1	*	Well, shouldn't they?

t1_ds9h1j3	1	*	No no no,  he was just born on the first day of the fourth month back in 88. It's a reference to his roots. He's not a nazi, he's just pinin' for the everglades.

t1_ds9xhjy	1	*	I know plenty of Russians, Ukrainians, and Europeans, none would call Russia (or Ukraine) European.
t1_ds9b5y3	0	*	Well, yeah, Saddam was responsible since he did start a war of aggression. 
t1_dsabjpf	0	*	Not-so-fun fact: If you see a right winger joking about throwing people out of a helicopter, that comes from Pinochet.
t1_ds9s9ju	1	*	People are low key fighting in the comments section of a facetious comment I made. This is awesome.

t1_ds9azzc	1	*	Theres a nearly two millions of those twelvers in the Gulf countries, they are considered a security threat and is a big part of the Saudi paranoia regarding Iran. 
t1_ds9n8ug	1	*	Ive read it. Not even one single attack on Americans in 5 years.
t1_ds9f2t0	0	*	One is definitely worse than the other though.
t1_dsaddwu	1	*	Isn't this whataboutism? Moreover, U.S'. meddling and regime change has been on another level since the end of WWII, compared to any other country out there.  
t1_ds9qgdg	1	*	Tibet is never gonna be free from Chinese rule but it can become more. free in terms of religious and cultural. 
t1_dsa6gei	1	*	Your reply was never anything of value anyway
t1_ds9u0jx	0	*	Damn, Jews really suck at ethnic cleansing if the Palestinian population grew.
t1_dsa93n6	1	*	Tell me what happens should their population grow to match or even exceed the number of voting Jews. Tell me about zionism and the principles Israel is based on.   
t1_dsa58pj	1	*	I dont have a role in this discussion. Just pointing out that ~2000 means the 00s.
t1_ds9mqfv	1	*	Pretty much every speech nuttyahoo has given the UN for starters...
t1_dsa7mjj	0	*	Try to monopolize victim-status all you want but the fact remains that Israel is the only country actually wiping people off the map
t1_ds9jlyu	1	*	You just summed up being reductive about the whole thing.
t1_ds9nelc	0	*	It means someone is for a free Tibet, whatever good that does. It doesn't mean they want someone to start a war with China and actually free Tibet. You're not the intended audience of that sticker.
t1_dsa46wi	0	*	But America, still greatest and free-est country ever amirite? 
t1_ds9y61l	0	*	War against who? The gulf states? Damn right they'd wipe the floor with them. Are you really so clueless as to how much help the US has to provide to the Sunni monarchies? 
t1_ds9cydt	0	*	They're not talking about genocide. 
t1_ds9jzxh	0	*	The pan arab nationalism is clearly leaded by Iran since the overthrow of the Sha.
t1_ds9xlf9	0	*	That's right, if you don't support the people fighting against Sunni extremists then you're helping them, and they should chant that about America and Israel after everything we've done to them. 
t1_ds98t6b	1	*	Yep, agreed. By any actual rights standards it's complete garbage, but for the region and for the governance they had before, it's wonderful. Cheers man
t1_ds9jnxt	1	*	If only it was a meme
t1_dsaxyqm	1	*	> I never said a damn thing about Iran surrounding Israel  That was a mistake, considering you were replying a comment that talked about iran in a thread about iran
t1_ds9t4x1	1	*	Technically correct, the best kind of correct.

t1_ds9jno2	0	*	The oil on the middle east has huge worldwide power, there's a lot and it's cheap to extract. No nation is allowed to ignore it because we all need it.
t1_dsa817a	0	*	They already had a country! Simply because some Europeans didn't think so doesn't mean anything and it wasn't their job to give away their land just because Europeans didn't want to live with Jews.

t1_duqcqd3	1	*	You also weren't trying to stone each other to death.  And you probably didn't use rock slings either.

t1_dsmxv5g	1	*	Wow. You apparently have no idea what that term means. You have no valid point, no argument to back anything up, so you resort to that nonsense. Good job. 
t1_dtbs4k0	1	*	>  Its a post colonial backwater on the fringe of the worlds biggest trading block. Your glory days are gone.  Well that does that make Scotland then? 
t1_dtbs6vf	0	*	You can have an opinion on whatever you like, but if you want people to listen to it it's got to be a good one.

t1_duxivao	1	*	Of course he has, metal gear is his favorite series
t1_dswyxt3	0	*	Yeah, science *does* have evidence of the big bang. That's why it's an established theory and not a hypothesis. Do you even know what that means, or are you one of the it's just a theory! dumbfucks?

t1_dsenlnn	0	*	Ah I see, failure to understand.  You people was refering to idiots online like yourself.  Not Salvadorians.  Sorry if I confused you and you mistook it for an insult.
t1_dsf4t98	0	*	The point remains. They started a life without any future 
t1_dsf35lf	0	*	Wait are you talking about The USA?   Also.. it was an earthquake that caused them to leave. Is Mother Nature the ruling party there? 
t1_dse5qfn	1	*	They are still very different economies with very different struggles, and being uprooted from one to be stuck into another after establishing ones' self is awful.

t1_dut08rc	0	*	Oh awesome! I will absolutely check that out! Sounds right up my alley! Thanks for the suggestion!!
t1_dusvq4g	1	*	Christianity isn't special. All religions bleed into complex interpretations as they grow in followers, begin to split into subgroups, and so on, and so forth.
t1_dt6dj6e	0	*	Antifa is pretty openly associated with anarcho-communism, so there's that.
t1_dt6pmp0	0	*	What exactly are the means of production in an economy that is service based and post-industrial?
t1_dt5zu55	1	*	that doesn't change what I said, on the contrary : yes the nazis competed with the KPD on the same electorate : the SA would have been perfectly fine as part of a red brigade

t1_dt6akl7	0	*	Is that the dogma I update?
t1_dt6f3o3	0	*	I hate self-righteous assholes.

t1_dt6fpkd	0	*	I know what a neoliberal is
t1_dt7rhd6	0	*	There are two kinds of cultures: one which understands and is capable of using the *ultima ratio regum*, or cultures that were/are about to get extinguished by the former.
t1_dt6ivy4	0	*	But it is my answer. Both christian and islamic nations have their ups and downs.
t1_dt7ng16	1	*	That's true across most of history. But Christendom had to adjust to the Enlightenment, meaning a huge chunk of Christians have embraced secularism. That's not true for Islam. 
t1_dt89a0g	0	*	And you connected his conversion with his political views which is far more illogical than what I proposed.
t1_dt7kq0r	1	*	Well yeah, Im a non-American too - they still used neoliberal completely incorrectly.
t1_dt6lr3e	0	*	Im not the bigot acting like any one religion is unique in this regard. Your deflecting, Im pointing out hypocrisy.   EDIT: Ah, brand new account and Trump supporter, now I understand 
t1_dt6am36	1	*	Uh huh. 
t1_dt5xjko	1	*	Or as in some active body disseminating the religion from the inside. Really anything except forced conversion and / or executions is good with me. 
t1_dt7mxit	1	*	How do you topple an authoritarian regime?
t1_dt6ovi5	0	*	Communism is hierarchal. Anarchism is not. Anarcho-communism seems a considerable contradiction.
t1_dt7khz2	0	*	If you missed the joke anarchy as a system can't work.  Democracy is not that awful, we should work on that system
t1_dt7t0lm	0	*	Fewer, if you're only counting the ones who lived.
t1_dt6dpfe	0	*	You can, and you still can't punch them, because that's illegal.  And yes, if you go around punching people without being provoked by their violence, you are the criminal. End of.

t1_dt641it	0	*	Sure, but it doesnt have anything against other religions or races. 
t1_dt6d8wb	1	*	Judging by modern capitalist Russia and China, that *clearly* worked out well.  Nevermind that a state of communism is an oxymoron...
t1_dt681ao	1	*	Well, someone did. I wouldn't leap to giving Hitler credit for that. It could have been any member of the inner circle who had it in for Rxf6hm.
t1_dulq9n9	1	*	This is so true. I know so many smart people who couldn't talk their way out of a paper bag and still *sound* intelligent 
t1_dumcxni	1	*	Its bias propaganda, he is a Marvel fan
t1_dum7v1s	1	*	You cant argue with leftists like this because they actively refuse to understand any point you make.
t1_dulu5a1	0	*	Well I don't know the economics of it, some holidays dont overlap and you can only get days off work for some. People can obviously celebrate whatever it is they want.
t1_dulys4m	1	*	I dont think lapid can form a coalition alone. He wont work with Arabs, ultra religious, or Bennett.

t1_dujglk0	0	*	well no... not really... 1400 victims over 16 years from a  population of 1.3million... compared to **300,000 every year** out of a population of 300million.   The US is FAR FAR WORSE LMFAO
t1_duhq9xd	1	*	They have religious traits but are not religions since they dont have an established core. A single source 
t1_dui3osj	1	*	Why dont we all ask ourselves that
t1_duiiox5	1	*	Thanks, I'll have a read! 
t1_dsxpder	0	*	No, I'm disputing the part that starts with brutal dictator.
t1_dsxqooy	1	*	do you dispute that assad uses similar methods as the Israelis to kill terrorists who are using human shields?
t1_dsykjzo	1	*	Violating another country's border is.
t1_dtb9gcf	0	*	I hope you are not just a generic evangelicuck masquerading as a militant atheist.
t1_dv4cl8m	0	*	Wow, just wow. You give me links to strawmen that pertain in no way whatsoever to the original inquiry?  https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2018/mar/1/more-cover-up-questions/
t1_dv49muq	1	*	They post on CBTS_Stream.
t1_dthaamw	0	*	Living yes, human no. Edit: I meant a person. A fetus is a human in development, not a person.
t1_dtic1jl	1	*	I'm not suggesting they be shamed into not aborting. But don't pretend that you are doing the baby any favors by killing it.
t1_dthq2uv	1	*	If you truly believe that go to a hospital and donate all your organs
t1_dti6kft	0	*	Hate Poland cause they're christian. Love them cause they don't accept refugees from shithole Middle East.  I'm torn.

t1_dthmhtb	0	*	~~Or maybe it can one day if we can better quantify life and consciousness. I hope so, anyway.~~  ETA: I realized the holes in my logic. 
t1_dth959i	1	*	Yes. Yes it does. 
t1_dthba33	0	*	So, just because it's not humans, what about a theoretical parallel species of similar intelligence? Would they not deserve basic human rights?
t1_dss7nu8	0	*	I'm sorry, but you have no fucking idea what you're talking about. The USSR **was** a super power, but Russia is not. The US is considered to be the sole superpower on the planet today.
t1_dsc5m7s	0	*	Youre not a woman.
t1_duw5dag	1	*	I get that, I just think peoples liberation (military) navy would be a better translation.

t1_duudvfr	0	*	Why doesnt i have shields? Kind of silly of a warship
t1_duv0zsd	1	*	SCS isnt anywhere they want. Nice try on moving the goal post and building a giant straw man out of a false dichotomy, but that was a huge shift. Last I check Argentina isnt anywhere near SCS.  
t1_duupx8l	1	*	and the Holy Roman Empire!
t1_duuhd9t	0	*	Democracy.
t1_duunjhh	0	*	The fact that there are no term limits *combined* with the fact there is no way for the Chinese people to remove Xi from office, would make him a dictator. What do you think China is, a democracy?
t1_duunsuy	0	*	that i understand, however it seems they still take/consume a lot more fish than they should have to, im not saying they cant fish , but im pretty sure they could lower it
t1_duuq9do	0	*	Tbf, I think they are in Germany for a slightly different reason
t1_duuk7gm	0	*	The british left too. Why isn't Buenos Aires establishing a fishing colony claiming it as well? Are the british illegally staying on a French territory?
t1_duumahp	0	*	Is it possible that the US has additional capabilities at sub detection that they don't reveal?  
t1_duuhmuw	1	*	france has always been a big fan of nuclear technology,  tons of nuclear reactors, nukes, nuclear powered carrier, they went very full throttle with it all

t1_duuocok	1	*	You're insanely obtuse and close minded on this issue, I'm not being dragged into a conversation about Iraq.  
t1_duugm7t	0	*	I do not disagree!  Industrial fishing is out of hand!  But as one of our greatest 20th century philosophers once stated, It's okay to eat fish, because they don't have any feelings.
t1_duupb7k	0	*	what im talking about was well within magna germania
t1_duuixsx	0	*	In the second game he shouts abandon ship! if the cruiser takes even a single point of damage off screen.  Suffice to say he is probably incompetent.
t1_duuicn2	0	*	Nuclear propulsion or payload? Either sounds like a terrible idea for the rest of us.  Edit: I mean for the submersible mines
t1_duupvlq	0	*	I didn't think I would have to explain this to someone here, but Russia also has military infrastructure and they spend a lot of money on it...
t1_duursgd	0	*	And in the US, we train actal death squads to dissapear people for supporting communism.   http://www.soaw.org/about-the-soawhinsec/soawhinsec-grads/notorious-grads
t1_duuly71	1	*	my government is mean to you... Hit the nail right on the head there.
t1_duuzqz7	0	*	There are extensive and specific answers to your points. Debated by people way more educated on the subject. If you really are asking the answer is within your reach, don't be discouraged
t1_duv18pa	1	*	great. then make this pedantic argument to the OP. it has nothing to do with what i said. 
t1_duuseot	0	*	Actually, I just checked Wikipedia and it said that the J-20 and J-31 are both fighters..... Although the J-20 looks too big to be an air superiority fighter...
t1_duuwmq8	1	*	And that's why the majority of media is about the west and sometimes the east whenever something of significance happens. Such as in Russia's case, a war in Europe. In China's case, a new dictator.
t1_duuutuj	0	*	Gotcha.  Thanks!
t1_duumsxu	0	*	Board it? I'm not sure how this works.
t1_duuwss5	0	*	But the problem is that in the media it's used wrong too. I've seen it used wrong far more times than I have seen it used right.
t1_duuqgk8	0	*	 They're both arthopods.... So that's like saying we are geneticically very close to sea squirts. As in... not at all
t1_dw9eq7w	0	*	Probably a very, very large amount. Much more than they are capable of launching at the same time. The Navy will just shoot them all down pretty easily. 
t1_duv73go	1	*	Ohhhh, okay.   Yeah, I agree with that
t1_duundnt	1	*	StarCraft II
t1_duurrey	0	*	No. The A in planes is army. But army in China means all military forces. So it's not the navy is party of the army nor it ever was a branch of the army. It's just some translation issue.
t1_duuqqc6	1	*	What illegal fishing are the Nordics doing? And don't mention whaling, Norway's whaling is not illegal.
t1_duui6a9	1	*	Good one sir/siress.
t1_duup8t4	0	*	Ah you got me good! Need to calm down. Have you seen my little book of stress? 
t1_duujqmb	0	*	Well we can easily farm pigs to reproduce the ones we kill. Not so much for whales.
t1_duut3ix	0	*	But they are doing it. They want to build a canal in Nicaragua I think, that would greatly diminish the importance of the Panama canal. I don't know if the US is really doing something about it.
t1_duuxruu	1	*	Sounds right.  Basically, the ships all habe weaknesses but when they are moving together all those weaknesses are compensated for by the other ships strength.
t1_duulucl	0	*	This sort of thing may be why the likes of the U.S, Australia and UK are investing so much in the likes of Goalkeeper active defenses.
t1_duurw63	1	*	I wasnt giving you an annual figure. Also it was a joke. Aircraft carriers over the past 20 years have run from 8 to 15 billion to build with a 1.5b annual operating cost per vessel.
t1_duum4l3	1	*	Obviously. 
t1_duuml9a	1	*	I'd return fire, but all I have is 3.5 floppies
t1_duul4zg	0	*	Fair enough and similiar behavior should be treated equally...I'm no expert in the field but I assume not all illegal fishing is created equally.

t1_duvbpp1	1	*	I feel a close brotherly bond with you already!
t1_duuxapk	1	*	Then never mind. XD
t1_duutlsm	1	*	>Whataboutism is a logical fallacy that attempts to justify wrong actions  The problem is, who defines right and wrong? What you think is right may be considered wrong by others. 
t1_duuphs0	1	*	China has better media then N Korea and IMO Russia.  They try to sell themselves as progressive and hold themselves as better then others
t1_duuo3r0	0	*	Humans are not animals, we were created in God's image. Animals were created for us to feed on. Idk where you liberals get this dumb notion that we are animals.
t1_duuk79x	0	*	You know why? I prefer we don't have World War 3, thanks. Heck, I prefer China doesn't invade other countries and kills people.  
t1_duukjo8	1	*	I say the solution to the problem is to give the islands to Haiti.  The French settled it first and Haiti clearly is the inheritor of the French Colonial Empire in the Americas.
t1_duudspf	1	*	Engage!
t1_duuxqlg	0	*	And Congress still has the power to issue letters of marque, too.
t1_duup296	0	*	It was a joke on the other redditor. 
t1_duuir7d	1	*	Thats really fascinating, thanks!
t1_duvg7nc	1	*	I think you'll find most amimal rights folks are pretty unhappy about those as well.
t1_duuk9yj	1	*	Im genuinely interested. Can you elaborate on the effects of oil being priced in dollars and what the difference is to saying oil is traded in dollars. 
t1_duui6fl	0	*	So...same shit except we don't act like it's something to be proud of, which might be why china and russia are looked down upon for the same actions

t1_duusoq9	1	*	The key part is running in to a sub   The basics are the same that they were in ww2. It's very hard for a sub to get close to a carrier.  Harder now than back then

t1_duuom5e	1	*	LOL this is the greatest comment I've read in a long time.
t1_duuixcq	1	*	I hope we (Sweden) got something good in return for leasing the sub to the US after the war games.  Edit: Was probably hoping to sell a few of them.
t1_duyrd7l	1	*	Don't forget the Dutch Zr. Ms. Walrus submarine who 'sank' the Theodore Roosevelt carrier and 8 other boats in 1999!

t1_dsh7q08	0	*	What type of person is going to fast food restaurants for breakfast, lunch, and dinner every single day of the week?  
t1_dsi9qiq	0	*	Canadian. Sorry I mistook the intent of your comment. In my defense, tone doesn't translate well via text.
t1_dsh4sks	0	*	Sure, but at that point are you arguing that Tim Horton's shouldn't employ anyone?
t1_dsh0l5x	0	*	And why is it that there are so many unskilled minimum wage jobs now instead of skilled higher paying jobs?
t1_dshrfv8	0	*	It isn't clearly defined. It is just moving the goalposts. 
t1_dsh2i12	1	*	you're probably right about that
t1_dsh1a70	0	*	I am still waiting for that economic definition of living wage. Go ahead.   Still waiting how Supply and Demand are stupid. 
t1_dshzyqy	1	*	What the hell business does Tim Hortons have calling themselves Canadian patriots when they don't even offer one of the quintessential Canadian foods?!?!? That's 100% blasphemy right there.
t1_dshcihi	1	*	I tell this to people all the time.  McCafe is actually of decent quality. They are doing well with changing their image. 
t1_dsh2wde	1	*	Everything's coming up Milhouse!

t1_dsi7phx	0	*	Is the issue that you don't believe that everyone deserves to live a healthy life, then? Because that's how it sounds, and if it's true, you're a monster.
t1_dsh8s1h	0	*	That would be a beautiful pay.. But your in the GTA... So that makes sense... Thats painful :( I wanted to move to TO to go to sheridan college but it so expensive...
t1_dshcqg1	0	*	It's a graded hike and there was ample warning. It's not like it happened over night. Also, Alberta over the last couple years raised their min wage over 40%... Not a peep there
t1_dsgtqc1	0	*	>paid in accordance to what you produce  You realise that is actually the Labour theory of value which you guys dont believe in because it is a Commie theory right?
t1_dsh3j59	0	*	Lol, run? That's what you have managers for. A local Tim Hortons franchisee near me earns their profits for doing little more than making the weekly schedule.
t1_dsh7l2b	1	*	In my home town in central New Hampshire, the couple McDonald's around the area are actually paying more than retail stores and giving semi-regular raises for long term and returning employees.

t1_dsgyfk0	0	*	Really fun fact: etymologist who handle a lot of cockroaches become allergic to them and at the same time become allergic to pre-ground coffee.  I'll let you put two and two together  
t1_dsiqmts	1	*	Same for two malls near me ( Pickering and Oshawa), both very popular, clean malls that are constantly upgrading.   Sears is a ghost town and the rest is bustling.

t1_dsgyl8l	0	*	Jeri-Lynn Horton-Joyce owns the store. I think being Tim Horton's daughter qualifies her as being part of the Horton family.
t1_dsh4u0c	1	*	Agreed. 
t1_dshdm2t	1	*	You need to become the new Tim's CEO. Walnut crunch and their bowties. Damn...those things were made in heaven.
t1_dshnof5	1	*	My local places that care about coffee decided to start talking about the origin and roasting, or roasting onsite.   It ups their odds of being able to sell a pound of coffee or a mug.  
t1_dsgyqaw	1	*	Depends if the little piece of the plastic bag I cut falls back into the bag or pot while I pour it out.
t1_dshfblt	1	*	Just liek Blockbuster ignored and refusing to invest or buy netflix..

t1_dshtbuu	0	*	So you dont think people work jobs they arent enjoying??

t1_dshi63y	0	*	Holy shit, people get cut breaks at 37? I can *maybe* understand him not being as fast once he's like 50, but come on, 37 isn't even halfway through your working life.
t1_dsgui0i	0	*	Its a simplistic view of the world. By espousing it, you either come across as selfish or lacking in mental capacity. So stay happy buddy, maybe youre not selfish. 
t1_dsgxevj	1	*	And deadly to a disproportionately high number of elderly people in hot areas that are only getting hotter. 
t1_dsgxhx5	1	*	We had a few of these a couples years ago in Montreal. Now they're McDonald's with a half-separate McCafe inside.

t1_dsh9jay	0	*	Yes but your average waiter can easily remember a single order.
t1_dsi2zzl	1	*	You're right. It is mostly men.
t1_dshd1rp	1	*	To be fair, ATT was offered the Internet free from the Gov. They turned them down saying there was no profit to be made on it.
t1_dsh5lsk	0	*	I think I know better how much I'm paid than you do, buddy.
t1_dsh0d24	0	*	Anecdotal evidence is almost as bad as no evidence! 
t1_dsh1wz4	1	*	You're right, they will fill a reusable cup and I used to do that regularly during my student days in northern Ontario. But where I'm from (in Toronto) I've never once seen that happening.
t1_dsh9h6t	0	*	It sounds like they are too widespread to be useful location markers.   They seem superfluous when you could just say by the movie theater or by the McDonald's.
t1_dsh21kq	1	*	Maybe not but there is *usually* a correlation between the two.
t1_dsh92fy	0	*	Dave & Busters is too goddamn expensive. After the novelty wore off at my local one hardly anybody seems to go there. Don't know how long they're gonna last either tbh
t1_dshdqcc	0	*	Doesn't take extremes when you don't make shit.
t1_dshaoh4	0	*	It might mean something if commercial real estate wasnt experiencing a massive fallout right now.   This is a shit strategy. 
t1_dshlirj	1	*	Ok. Let me try again.  I have a suspicion that you are a tablecloth. Am I right? Or is one interaction not enough to make that kind of call?

t1_dsh5mns	0	*	Did Buffalo not have GPS yet in 2009?
t1_dsh815i	0	*	Keep in mind the user who sourced the $265K did mention that it was not current.
t1_dshpd96	0	*	This is true. But by decent I just mean, 'won't give me diarrhea for the rest of the morning'. 
t1_dsh5wjj	1	*	Cheaper when you account for the loyalty program.
t1_dshbic0	1	*	For awhile Macs convenience stores had Seattles Best. That was a decent cup
t1_dsh0kvw	0	*	Nope! For most of the US the minimum wage would have to be about $20 an hour to provide the basic needs for a small family.   [Source](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.citylab.com/amp/article/404644/)

t1_dsh9yph	0	*	Facts are what scare you.
t1_dsgyw68	0	*	The problem is everyone who disagrees with people on that sub are labelled bigots, racists, nazis, misogynists.....it's a total echo chamber with zero tolerance for any opposing views.

t1_dsh35j0	0	*	What services would you like them to cut to make up for the lost tax revenue?
t1_dsi2bpc	0	*	Sorry for using worker singular. I'd like to amend it to say workers. All workers paid hourly are benefited from a wage increase. Every time. Paying broke people more always helps them. 
t1_dsh7bgl	0	*	I never said there was a law. Its an ethical obligation and a commitment made to shareholders. Thanks for playing.
t1_dsh1fk4	0	*	It feels like shovelling shit in a wind tunnel, but somebody has to correct the liberal stupidity. 
t1_dsgyerm	0	*	Was referring to individual income, which is about 50k

t1_dshk5o7	1	*	I'll try again. Tax write offs are deductions on income. No income, no write offs.
t1_dshhige	0	*	Very much Canadian - just not a Rush fan
t1_dt7ii35	0	*	I do not see this being a productive use of time. Sorry.  Have a nice night.
t1_dt7pn01	0	*	Tell me the same thing when your son or daughter is raped in school. And if you're in Sweden, they will probably give the rapist 40 hours of communisty work as punishment. 
t1_dt7rn75	0	*	The assumption being, of course, that paedophiles don't act out or can prevent themselves from doing so.
t1_dt859ys	1	*	http://www.apa.org/topics/lgbt/transgender.aspx  I don't know what else to say but all of this. 
t1_dt8gvwy	0	*	What state would that be?
t1_dt7ud96	0	*	Where did I advocate for that? Please show me. I'm saying that you're using terrible logic to justify your position - literal homophobic propaganda that equates gay people with paedophiles. 
t1_dt8rje8	0	*	Might have been an edit. 
t1_dt94729	1	*	Calm down mate. Youre missing points entirely.  No one condones the act. But science is science.  If the brain does something theres no amounts of oppinion power that can sway it. 
t1_dt89lrv	0	*	That's a problem with our implementation, not the penalty itself. We should use it more like China.
t1_dt7xs78	1	*	And your emotionally fueled opinion outranks the American Psychiatric Association, right got it.
t1_dtfdm91	1	*	So Germans were involved in a case where 40 Polish people rounded up 300+. Yeah, I'm sure that proves without a shadow of the doubt that the concentration camps were Polish.
t1_dtfk1fp	0	*	...what?
t1_dtgkdx3	0	*	At least we have acknowledgement  to the fact that Polish people committed crimes against Jews. Polish compatriots. It is a good start
t1_dtfnmjt	1	*	IIIrd Reich and [General Government](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Government)?
t1_ds5omm0	0	*	As I mentioned, those Non-Nuclear subs are diesel-electric (i.e. expensive coffins)
t1_ds5wtxm	0	*	Im being pretty cynical but I imagine they do that with their own facilities or a facility they are working with to cut costs by reusing all the plastic they use so they dont have to buy new plastic
t1_ds6i2c5	1	*	I think if anything this proves just how limited our capacity to recycle plastic is. Can't dump it in China? system grinds to a halt.

t1_duo5awi	0	*	No such thing as a benign dictatorship especially one that uses Russian terrorists to bomb cities.   It should be killed off along with any of its supporters.
t1_duo0p0m	0	*	No it wasn't utopia but millions didn't die . Sure Saddam was no angel but he didn't kill millions of his people like Americans did 
t1_duo7lyy	0	*	The state of Syria was already a western invention from the SykesPicot Agreement. Time to right a wrong and UN Forces can help with that and there is always someone around to govern.
t1_duo04vp	0	*	no it means that you looking for something it doesn't have to do with a current situation. Holocaust of 6 million Iraqis by Americans . Mind you I care less about em but world needs to know

t1_dtdivjx	1	*	This is called unintended consequences Trump is an A->B guy, he isn't really about the bigger picture.

t1_dsm32ms	0	*	lulz, you dodged the question. You'd let trump shit in your mouth as long as a liberal had to smell it, wouldn't you? I bet you'd do it even without the liberal there. 
t1_dsm0lhb	0	*	Jesus, 10 years later and Belaga STILL didn't get it. He just doesn't get why Stewart eviscerated him like he did.
t1_dslyney	0	*	And you think Canadians versus Americans could think the same thing? Lol that's some stupid shit you're spouting.
t1_dsnptww	0	*	The message is that we shouldn't import unskilled individuals. I don't see the problem with that. I agree that it's crass, but it isn't inaccurate.   Side note: Who names their *son* Lindsey...

t1_dsm26to	1	*	Hey, I found an audio clip from a rally full of trumpsters. I tried to watch it, but unfortunately I don't speak sheeple. Wow, 12 hours worth.            https://youtu.be/rB66uJjo_pA

t1_dslvh5u	0	*	If you follow it by a mangled version of their name and Hur Durr, can't pronounce that duuuuh. then its probably a huge waste of everyone's time.   There's a reason Chinese adopt a western name.. 
t1_dsly5rc	1	*	Yeah, people know that you mean no harm. It's just weird for Korean Americans to hear that question, because North Korea is like ISIS to us.
t1_dsm6aki	0	*	He or she wrote Asian Americans. Is that your final answer?
t1_dslzrsv	0	*	Great response and good counter argument, you immediately loose any value in this discussion and I will not waste my time messagiing you further.

t1_dslyotw	1	*	He did! (Manson, not Romney, in case anyone was confused.)

t1_dsm1ig0	0	*	How so?
t1_dsmsw8w	0	*	Except they don't. They're adamant that I couldn't be American born and bred. I'm trying to move on and they're the ones who won't let it go because they refuse to believe I'm American.

t1_dsm0oy2	1	*	How so?

t1_dslyxhx	0	*	Seriously...he fucking blew it with that guy, he sounds almost NOTHING like Obama. Someone needs to make another version of this so I can show it to Trump supporters.

t1_dsm00a7	0	*	Real taxation goes to benefits for all. This is simply forced thievery 
t1_dslrzeb	1	*	I was 26, employed and had most of my education done. I am glad as fuck reddit didn't exist when I was a teenager.

t1_dsmr2t0	1	*	Please do!
t1_dsm3h2r	1	*	I read it more as Trumps words coming out of Obamas mouth would be funny. It is almost impossible  to imagine Obama conducting himself that way. That makes it absurd and therefore amusing. 
t1_dslwfuw	0	*	99% chance someone asking Where are you from originally? is going to have no clue what that means.
t1_dsm59ml	1	*	Eh.  It's uncommon enough to be notable, and the couples of that sort I've met have tended to be much more interesting than average.
t1_dslxi9o	0	*	Obama is like the cool humble of Morgan Freeman and the sweet silliness of Kermit.

t1_dsm5yoi	0	*	Now I'm interested, what would the level of destruction be in today's terms?
t1_dslzq3t	0	*	Why would coming from a country with poor living conditions disqualify you from coming to the U.S? Is there something inherently wrong with anyone who isn't from a developed country?

t1_dsoyqys	0	*	Listen man, those are the problems YOU outlined as being the parameters for a shithole country. Im just pointing out we have them.

t1_dsm0hq5	1	*	This is very classy 
t1_dslzmbp	0	*	Whats ur perspective on the revolutionary war then? Where Americans fought and killed their oppressors for their liberties. And werent even enslaved?
t1_dsm08x2	1	*	Of all things Trump does, I don't see how this could bother you.
t1_dsm8j37	1	*	Finds out Trump is the GOP nominee, not President. Video was posted in July '16, after the RNC Convention.
t1_dsnb2s3	1	*	a) if I were in the US I'd probably just ask are you from [city]? to whoever and b) because you can never quite know who're you're dealing with in an Expat setting.

t1_dslul3k	1	*	Well that's true too
t1_dsm831r	0	*	Ok, lets see your credentials and track record so we can determine how much weight to give that evidence. Also, context matters.   Oh yeah, also give us your full name the way journalists do.

t1_dsm7tuq	1	*	Absolute roaster.

t1_dsmeqe6	1	*	XD Yea, that's a good point! I'll bet I have at least once without knowing it.
t1_dsm0nkj	0	*	The Daily Show was a comedy show just as much as Jimmy Kimmel Live is an entertainment talk show.  It's entertainment that is also politically partisan. I consider it no different than Fox news.
t1_dslus40	0	*	Just having the wrong sort of name or accent is an issue here. Granted the darker you are the further down the shit slide you end up. 
t1_dsm0zr5	1	*	Seems like that person would be acting xenophobic, in that case.
t1_dsmr2b7	1	*	Why, exactly? What does a top Republican have to gain by lying about Trump's words?  And bullshit, you just walked back from saying that two senators said it *didn't happen*, which they didn't.
t1_dslvio0	1	*	It's fallen out of favor? When did that happen?
t1_dsm1yc1	0	*	No one's said that though.
t1_dslyvoi	0	*	I love that you're downvoting me though.
t1_dsmpkr4	1	*	You can be both annoyed, even express that annoyance, and still educate them so that others wont be annoyed :)  But hey, your life. I understand if you have other things going on.
t1_dslvtou	1	*	Yes exactly you said it. It's a standard ice breaker and that's what he said, he hates explaining it for someone who half cares (at best for ice breaker bs small talk )
t1_dsm1gml	1	*	Oh yeah, I get that. It's just...the fact those 4 even make the list concerns me.
t1_dsmz5uh	1	*	I think you need to go to the safe place, since youre the one getting MACROD
t1_dsm8jld	0	*	Why are you calling him Usamah?  Edit: Unless its just another person named Usamah, in which case, who is that? I didnt pay much attention when Obama got the Peace Award.

t1_dsm70du	1	*	That all you could muster? Typical redneck.
t1_dsmr9ej	1	*	It's a bit of a catch-all that looks anywhere from middle-eastern to Mediterranean. I fit right in in Mexican, Greek, Italian, Spanish, middle-eastern neighborhoods. 
t1_dsm4t48	0	*	I am a minority here. I'm a conservative on Reddit.
t1_dsmb1w4	0	*	Look at the original comment you replied to. Not an odd takeaway at all. Also, my concern was not with asking nicely, but let's avoid the topic altogether because you seem to be getting a bit touchy.
t1_dslvh0z	1	*	No, it's a bit awkward to ask that way but also definitely a more polite way to do it.
t1_dslyw9s	0	*	Yeah, different countries have different cultures. I'm not sure what you're pointing out beyond that though.
t1_dsm768r	0	*	That's what Jews thought in Germany too. Didn't work out too well for them.
t1_dsm9sze	1	*	Isnt an American living in Brazil completely different from an American living in America who has Brazilian ancestors, for example? 
t1_dsmrm8u	0	*	So Haiti isn't a shithole? So I'm guessing Haitian immigrants can go back then?
t1_dslz4w7	0	*	Are you joking? Reddit is one big hive mind, stuffed with mini hive minds, that all feed on each other. 
t1_dsm5wr9	1	*	At best they downplay it. At worst they do what you said, fake history.
t1_dsm1am9	1	*	When youre an USAn, USAn lives mean more to you than others, despite equality. 
t1_dsm42yj	1	*	Those are good burgers, Walter

t1_dsm0l71	0	*	I love Asia and Asians in general. Fascinated by their rich history and culture. Im from San Francisco. Not sure if thats a place of privilege but I grew up dirt poor. 
t1_dso3uip	1	*	I figured that much out! I didn't know in my teen years and I probably spammed a lot of people because I didn't realize.
t1_dsmhow4	1	*	I mean they reviewed it. They just couldn't change anything because they didn't have the votes. They decided the current form was an upgrade over the old system. 
t1_dslvujf	0	*	As a white presenting person no one has ever asked me where Im from as in where is your family from just, like, where do you live. 
t1_dsmewo4	1	*	It's a tough circumstance for sure.

t1_dsmaakg	1	*	At the same time, a defector might not want to discuss it with everyone that asks. You can't just expect people to be willing to satisfy your curiosity.

t1_dsm0c1i	1	*	That may be, I guess I have a lot of experience due to a game I used to play having a heavy SEA base, but it makes sense it's harder to see differences unless you're used to it. 
t1_dslyuds	0	*	A Christian who campaigned and voted for Doug Jones.

t1_dsm5tdh	1	*	I like steak medium well to well done how are you gonna tell other people what they like lmao 
t1_dsmpwwl	0	*	So you want me to explain why racism, sexism, and other forms of bigotry are factually incorrect?
t1_dslwivl	1	*	I never assume what city a person is from. That would be racist. You see a black guy and you ask, are you from Detroit? You see a Chinese guy and ask, Are you from San Fran?

t1_dslw28u	0	*	When people ask me where I'm from, they don't keep pressing for my heritage if I tell them New Jersey or North Carolina because I'm white though.
t1_dsmmazw	1	*	I understand. But for some the implication is there and it's a sucky experience for them. There are many other topics of discussion. It's not particularly difficult. 
t1_dsm20k0	1	*	K, Hillary sucks, great point!, now back to the issue of Trump being a complete moron and not suitable for the role of president...
t1_dsm1hgi	1	*	Very voyeuristic. In my opinion it really says something about the repressed and artificial public natures of sex and sexuality in America
t1_dslvxql	0	*	quick maths
t1_dslw2xd	1	*	But Tony Abbott is not a Trump. Tony Abbott is a mainstream conservative, I'd even go as far as to call him a Tory fanboy. He's an idiot, but he's all about the status quo and the party line.
t1_dslx2oq	0	*	Not a fan of jalapenos, but I've sprinkled tabasco sauce on my slices and I enjoy it like that.
t1_dsm3tkv	1	*	unfortunately you are right (unfortunately because I feel it's weird if people resent others simply based on something like their nationality etc.).

t1_dsm1n1u	1	*	You got me.  They drink their own sewage in Flint, MI.  Silly me.  The rest is true about Gary. 
t1_dslvs3s	0	*	I'm not even upset lol. What I don't understand is why people ARE upset. A lot of the countries these leeches come from are shitholes. That's why they leave in the first place

t1_due1v3n	1	*	It does. You just have to spend 10k about half a million times to get a winner.
t1_dudtkaa	1	*	That list in America would be a list of scripts that no one takes  or get prescribed. Pharma and govt would see to that.
t1_dueoo0b	1	*	Like what? What specific products have government ever researched and developed? What applied science projects have been applicable to the general public, in order to solve a problem/meet a demand? 
t1_dudwbli	1	*	I think the law that they cant actually drink the alchohol in the commercials is redundant at that point 
t1_dudsk6v	0	*	In Syria a 3rd world shithole, if you don't mind me saying Naproxen/esomeprazole magnesium (Vimovo) cost around 3-4$, that's it.Not saying everything Syria is is good but that's a plus.

t1_due9rkn	1	*	OP talks shit about capitalism as if there are any real alternatives. The only ones that come to mind are communism and socialism which have never worked.
t1_dudtzbo	0	*	 The insurance companies love it. They take a %age off of healthcare costs. The only way they grow(outside of population growth) is through inflated healthcare costs.
t1_dudpuu9	0	*	No no no.  There is either capitalism or there is state power.  It's one or the other.  
t1_due4ima	1	*	*Welcumo Shiidy Engrish Langwijj, how may I herrp u?*
t1_due2kww	0	*	Capitalism does assume that. Which is why there is supposed to be room for competitors. One company gets greedy, you shoo somewhere else.
t1_dueevj5	1	*	Noted, which is crazy. I edited my post. Thanks.
t1_dudyt9l	0	*	Capitalism is fine...but when you have option of paying off/becoming the government to limit competition and engage in acts that would otherwise seen to be criminal, is when things go downhill fast.

t1_duduuco	1	*	Tldr people are stupid. 
t1_dudw6v5	1	*	Furthermore, a lot of patient education cant even be billed so that is a lot of primary prevention care thrown out the window.
t1_dudr5ix	0	*	What do you mean by I vote conservative? Almost all politicians are by nature conservative. You should vote for the ones that want to achieve the things you want in you society.

t1_duds9nh	0	*	>PBS?    >Public Broadcasting Network  Hmmm.
t1_dudsu0g	0	*	No.   American medical insurers and consumers distort and inflate the cost of drugs globally. Systems like the PBS need to be more widely adopted to reduce costs for everybody, not just a lucky few.

t1_dudyk3x	0	*	There are sectors - elective and cosmetic surgery. The costs of such procedures have fallen precipitously over the years.
t1_dug6mrf	0	*	You can absolutely refuse vimovo. Its not much different than refusing advil. The vouchers are free. Pharmacist can tell you what to take instead

t1_dudv93y	1	*	But it is only for over the counter meds
t1_dudr9fj	1	*	May as well keep trying then. What are the odds ANOTHER political strongman rises to the top and takes absolute control of our authoritarian apparatus of state.
t1_dudtof9	1	*	Haha I just replied to another comment saying the same thing. They come out and tell their fans not to do it but then make songs sounding like taking it is the best thing ever.
t1_dudswvm	1	*	Add flavour, done! 
t1_duebl4a	0	*	What if they had multiple conditions? Say if you made a certain amount of profit and recouped all your investment into R&D.
t1_dudypm2	0	*	> multivitamin is the equivalent of pharmaceuticals  Never change, Reddit. Never. Fucking. Change. 
t1_dudwqsb	0	*	Yes, the ED commercials with the frankly *hot* older lady that would, I'm sure, be able to get a rise out of an old fella without medication, no problem. 
t1_due6hy1	0	*	What question? You made a wild conjecture about opioids, which is completely unrelated to this, and then you freaked out when people told you that.
t1_dudwo5c	1	*	Right, if I cant drive to the store and pick it up the bottle of pills off the rack, you shouldnt be allowed to advertise for it. 
t1_due4yna	0	*	Healthcare is regulated at the State and not the Federal level in the US.  Although now there is a level of Federal bureaucracy on top of the State regulatory scheme.  
t1_dudunfd	1	*	1000% awesome.
t1_due1cpk	1	*	Beep beep, I'm a Jeep.
t1_duechk5	1	*	You have to wash out an entire chemical plant to the microscopic level and then there's still a good chance the same thing will happen again next month.
t1_dudtrvs	0	*	Academia still requires funding for research as well.   The teachers and students still gotta live too and have bills and necessities that require money. 
t1_duee644	1	*	Well, yes.  And I hope we can get to some facimile of that, within my lifetime.  I think greed is too powerful, however.
t1_ds3xbr8	0	*	But Africa's not a country either, and I highly doubt there are many European descended people in South Sudan.
t1_ds38mvw	1	*	Interested in change not short term profits 
t1_duybaa7	0	*	Yeah but what were some of the recent attacks
t1_duwf3a7	1	*	That 2d thing is really cool. It's a shame we're not going to have more time to really understand this stuff.
t1_dunyf4g	1	*	You're right about that haha  
t1_duqfely	0	*	No, none of that is what I meant or said. You are the only one making blanket statements.
t1_dulbj81	0	*	A destabilized America  could be the catalyst for even worse wars.   I don't really understand this fascination with seeing America turn to shit, as though the alternatives are better     
t1_dum4x2a	0	*	Trump didn't stoke any fire. This bullshit has been going on for years.
t1_dul6gqc	0	*	His comment has too many syllables to be from Trump's base, conversely if it was a feminist supporter of Hilary she should know better than to speak out of line asking questions. 
t1_dum6mhi	1	*	> If America is an obese diabetic Russia is handing us cookies and the only real solution is to focus on getting in shape.  My point exactly. It seems we're on the same page after all.
t1_dulk0zb	0	*	If you post on a GamerGate/Anti-Left crying subreddit, you're extreme and signal boost other extreme views.
t1_dulq0x5	0	*	A couple of crazy people on Twitter are the studios?  Holy shit, the goalposts have left the fucking stadium.
t1_dumnnb3	1	*	Well if Rush freaking Limbaugh is doing it...
t1_dulh2p2	0	*	It worked here in Scotland. It seemed to work in Australia.
t1_dumreg6	1	*	I'm not sure what agenda I'd be promoting unless I was promoting the spread of rational debate. It's not like I'm trying to hide that I'm left leaning or anything.
t1_dulqh1o	1	*	Some things deserve to be disrespected. Its not necessarily a bad thing. 
t1_dull0cu	1	*	No, they are consistently frequent.
t1_dulihfb	1	*	The leftists I deal with are usually anti gun. Lenin and Marx are dead so its a poor point to make. Ask any Antifa member their thoughts.
t1_duny8x6	1	*	So we just remove political groups all together like that one guy suggested back in the day. 
t1_duldovs	0	*	He's not wrong. The only people who believe that the US single-handedly won the war is the US. You're just drinking your own propaganda.
t1_dulmwqu	1	*	ha, we'll see buddy. 
t1_dulvnu2	0	*	Representative enough to elect the President
t1_duljz4q	0	*	He was pointing put that slavery was a right. The constitution has flaws. It's not a holy document bubba.
t1_dun6kp7	0	*	So why do they smash up Starbucks?  Is it a fascist front?  https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-daily-shows-trevor-noah-rails-against-antifa-they-are-vegan-isis
t1_dumb4et	1	*	Cool, this isn't the UK and you are dodging the point.  Guns are not the problem.  Mental health is.
t1_dulmq83	1	*	If only more agreed with you!  Just look at the Florida House today...porn is the big problem in that state.  Saddening.
t1_dulnanz	0	*	lmfao you're the tool. Go hide behind your gun big boy.
t1_dulcuby	1	*	[mornings here!](https://youtu.be/IHfmi-aIWpI) 
t1_dulms0q	1	*	Ding ding ding. When trump won all the_donald posts we just meme'd in a  president  I'd wager many of those people arent even voting age. They just think it's edgy and funny. I was 15 once, I get it. 
t1_dulnr86	1	*	So the congress/president of the United States doesn't force their laws on the states of the US? Don't see the difference, especially since election in the US isn't 100% democratic.
t1_duloowy	1	*	>  Black people will hate me for no reason when I walk down the street.  Uh huh.  
t1_dumdwqi	1	*	I always deep down believed this.
t1_dulfm5i	1	*	Doesn't matter how much they fuck with america, as long as the Russian people keep bending over for Putins cock they have no place to speak. 
t1_dulhewg	0	*	I'm not sure I follow but I didn't say anything about one side or another.
t1_duljvxt	1	*	Plenty of countries without guns that are ranked more free than the US. 
t1_dullgyf	0	*	Really? Your dislike of religion means you cant even rationally understand what purpose it serves? 
t1_dulkgts	0	*	I don't think we're using the same definition of reasonable. And what evidence do you mean by it being advantageous?
t1_dt62e3e	1	*	Didnt know that; thanks for expounding 
t1_dt63x8w	0	*	Ok, so yeah, dogs were not originally bred to be companion animals. We selectively bred them and changed them into friends while a divergent group evolved into food. 
t1_dt9e2jg	0	*	Oh I understood your point and fully agree, I just think it's completely irrelevant when talking about whether killing dogs is worse than killing other animals. 
t1_dt7h7a5	0	*	Why are you treating African slaves different from others who have the exact same capacity for emotions?  Well one of them is bred to be enslaved, the others aren't. Seems pretty obvious tbh.
t1_duughw2	0	*	Chickens are dinosaurs, so . . .
t1_dunnw7f	0	*	Nope, but America is the great Satan so it's their fault.
t1_dup8q1c	1	*	Ha! No worries. The last thing anyone needs, especially the Balkans, is fake news or anyone stirring the pot. ;)
t1_dup1o8n	1	*	You don't know, I watched news back then, it was stable as fuck. 
t1_dunnwsa	1	*	Nukes.
t1_dsk08yg	0	*	Starvation is still a problem in Africa, though, so clearly the demand exceeds the supply of food. Therefore, a farmer should have no trouble selling his goods, no?
t1_dskrz46	0	*	You are very confused. Go read all the comments again and apply a sarcasm filter. 
t1_duzecc0	1	*	Yes I'd say maybe 98-99%. Say an even 98.5?
t1_dtaj0xo	0	*	Well obviously, I already know that. By your logic however, you make it sound like we should give up immediately when trying to deal with bad things because there are assholes in the real world.
t1_dt9huwr	0	*	Thats not a citation thats a picture of a poultry carcass. You should really learn MLA or APA or Chicago style citations. 
t1_dtapslk	1	*	We've already had rape victims forced to pay child support to their rapists. I think I'd commit murder than do that. 
t1_dtadzha	1	*	Sounds to me like that's exactly the case. If you have to sue to get information, doesn't that mean you are legally denied the information by default?
t1_dtao3vy	0	*	As the proposed legislation is france says, this is to prevent threats and menace, not to protect egos, so I don't know which law you are talking about.
t1_dt9st92	1	*	My friend was day drinking and pissed in the bushes outside his house. Got cited for public indecency, two years on the registry.
t1_dt9xacm	1	*	They are not legally entitled to that knowledge if they have to sue for and potentially be denied the knowledge on any grounds whatsoever. 
t1_dt9nxfz	1	*	So you had two bad interactions with people known to you, and you're claiming that's synonymous with total strangers calling out to and harassing women? I don't see the link. 
t1_dssuedf	1	*	It's currently money to the defense industry. If it doesn't go to them this way, it will go to them another way. This administration wants to spend *even more* on defense, so that is the sad truth 
t1_dstmp1u	0	*	Ah, so you say the US is the only game in town, I show you otherwise, and you go petty.  You don't have to have a giant hammer to do things, as the article clearly shows.
t1_dst9zhj	1	*	hey, if we break a lot of windows we'll create lots of jobs for window repair!
t1_dssited	1	*	okay...
t1_dssuzot	1	*	yea what's a nuclear armed countries to some real balls.
t1_dssjpl5	0	*	I'm not Jewish but from my understanding Jewish state = Jewish majority. 
t1_dssjhm3	0	*	I'm not against the Jewish people, I'm again Israel. There's a difference. 
t1_dssaxqm	0	*	No, what does your actual post mean? I didn't get it.
t1_dsskdty	0	*	more like you may be overreacting.  In this case, you are :)
t1_dstavpi	1	*	Sure that dude just rigged the system so that he got a whole cake... but look my friends, CRUMBS!!
t1_dst5cfr	1	*	yh i know but we won that territory in ww1 
t1_dtb98gu	1	*	Egypt isn't in a war. If you expect first world countries to accept refugees you can do the same with Egypt. 
t1_dtbfa8g	0	*	It belongs to us because we say it does. 
t1_dtej72x	0	*	Ah yes because Egypt is the beacon of stability right now 
t1_dtcalua	1	*	It was a mean, bloody dress rehearsal for an even meaner, bloodier war. 
t1_dtckj8c	0	*	> 99% of white nationalist  yesterday  >99% of Egyptian Jews  Can't wait to see the next group of people you cite with these amazing statistics.  
t1_dtb8nyk	1	*	I'm pretty sure it is there because of Jerusalem.  
t1_dtbftwf	1	*	And that's your opinion and you're entitled to it. Thank you for sharing. 
t1_dtayxu3	0	*	Allowing people to immigrate legally is not the same as importing mass amounts of forced laborers.
t1_dtbg16v	1	*	Protestants in one corner, Catholics in the other. Winner faces the Jews.  It's a Republican-Royalist Rumble.
t1_dtbfhqg	0	*	Key word: _more_  Forgive me for putting the needs of those I care about and protect me over those of strangers. 
t1_dteeqt5	0	*	Just because people elect government officials doesn't mean they get to choose how they act. Especially if those officials are dishonest. 
t1_dtbfgf3	1	*	I'm sure you're right. 
t1_dtcccdd	0	*	I wouldn't, but, like most people on Earth, I'm not a property owner.
t1_dtbq3ye	0	*	Yeah it is, at a fundamental level. Countries without strong ethical institutions  systems languish for decades or centuries in corruption and underdevelopedness.
t1_dtbdaro	0	*	In a parliamentary system like Germany's in the 30's a single party was never going to win the majority of seats on its own.
t1_dtavybq	1	*	Well sons support far more right wing policies than Likud. Like Jewish Home 
t1_dtb8p43	0	*	Yes this is exactly the same.
t1_dtbh8vn	1	*	It's almost like... is such a condescending, smart-ass reply. No wonder Reddit likes it so much.
t1_dtazrfj	0	*	If you take over where people have been living, you are.
t1_dtbq4ke	0	*	Yeah it is, at a fundamental level. Countries without strong ethical institutions languish for decades or centuries in corruption and underdevelopedness.
t1_dtathzb	1	*	> The United States  
t1_dtfw8z8	1	*	Yes it does. 
t1_dtbcb93	0	*	Religious people are always delusional I don't understand why it's a surprise to you.
t1_dtbofsw	0	*	You've justified the Japanese attack just now. 
t1_dtayz6m	0	*	Very observant.
t1_dtfon9e	0	*	There are clerics all over youtube saying wife beating is ok. There is clearly an interpretation different from yours that some of these people are holding on to.
t1_dtfrlmh	0	*	Yeah, basically that except that the 10% chance part if you still want it after a year you get it ( to my understanding).   
t1_dtght71	1	*	Thank you. I'm simply objectively quoting texts here rather than having a heated take on them, but I guess that won't work when people don't want to read
t1_dtfkcwh	1	*	It doesn't. Only for Islamic family matters and that's why this case was so important to Malaysia, to determine if Shariah court can interfere with non-muslim family matters.  
t1_dtf1hc5	1	*	Wahhabis are just the easy scapegoat for everything that's wrong with Sharia. But it goes way past them
t1_dtfp5ee	1	*	Very little, since non-Muslims have limited political rights in Malaysia.
t1_dtfqin9	1	*	Okay? I wasn't saying they did. I talked about leaving it open and *never mentioned atheism* so you're arguing a point I never made in the first place mate. 
t1_ds3k1lp	1	*	lol taxes are a safety net for everyone.  and if you don't like them, you can usually move, or get legislation going to change them.  having children is not a safety net for your self.
t1_dsq8bzl	0	*	why do you think that minorities can't get an ID? 
t1_dsqbu0l	0	*	Apparently evolution and progress is impossible.
t1_dsrbzig	1	*	You don't know everyone.
t1_dsqjw0i	0	*	Did you know the largest group of people fighting the groups that commit muslim extremist terrorism are other muslims?

t1_dsq6c0o	0	*	It's interesting.  It started to load for me; I clearly saw a picture of the girl and her brother then it suddenly 404s.  I think something else is wrong there than a true 404
t1_dsqk256	0	*	> Teaching everyone that white people are all racists  I live in Houston and the only time I've heard this is from crazy people on the internet.
t1_dsqnm5h	0	*	>Theres nothing anti-feminist about it in the least.  lol k 
t1_dsq4h80	0	*	I completely disagree, and you seem to have no idea what racism is.  >The less qualified person won because he was black  [Citation needed] He seems highly qualified for the job.
t1_dsq39tj	1	*	I don't expect him to have been a mind reader. But now that the additional information is available, I think it is important to follow up on the dangers of falsifying reports about hate crimes.
t1_dsq6d8j	1	*	Yeah, your distinct culture doesn't need to be tied to skin color at all.
t1_dsqlnc3	1	*	No Im not
t1_dsqdctj	0	*	some guy made a meme of trump slapping CNN from trump's brief time in the WWE. CNN tracked him down and blackmailed the guy into an apology then acted very proud of themselves and still do 
t1_dsq6juk	1	*	Your confused
t1_dsqc3md	0	*	Wait, what? Is that an argument being put forth by anyone?
t1_dsqcc01	0	*	...the previous poster literally talked about their shitty country.  It's a religion not a race doesn't work when you're talking about it *as if* it we're a race.
t1_dsq7cg7	0	*	That doesn't mean you should promote stuff like the fish feeding story where the video was manipulated to not show Abe (Japanese PM) emptying his bowl into the water moments before Trump did the same.
t1_dsq6sfi	0	*	Also BC, AB, SK, MB.  It's new if you mean from the last 30 years.
t1_dsqk3g5	0	*	You're literally living in your own version of reality
t1_dsqhcgz	0	*	>You can't make social progress beyond Canada. We are already at the best it's gonna be.   Wow this is the most smug thing I've ever read. 
t1_dsq4rgw	0	*	And that's exactly what makes him so noble. True courage is knowing you're licked from the beginning and trying anyway
t1_dsq7oyf	0	*	Uh, if you're referring to the comment responding to your linked post there is a /s at the end of their post, so they definitely aren't calling you a racist. 
t1_dsq4yk5	0	*	are people born leftist too?
t1_dsqoos0	1	*	Ever heard of an hyperbole, it's the fact that they simply won't report on it most of the time, not every single time.
t1_dsqfrx3	1	*	Ah. Thanks for your insight.
t1_dsq0uby	0	*	Wow how did you survive being a victim of an 11 year old's fake claim that had nothing to do with you? You're so brave.

t1_dsqh6ps	0	*	this is why I Reddit, everyone is so helpful.  Thanks Reddit!
t1_dsr8pyt	0	*	So why do you hate on wikileaks for posting a single side of the data they likely have, hmm? Hmmmm?
t1_dsq8tqz	0	*	Shes 11. Shes just a child. Children lie. Children lie mainly because they are scared.   You sound like a Trump supporter. Go pick on someone your own size.
t1_dsq8t7w	0	*	Great questions, but I asked first.  Could you answer the question please.
t1_dsqay8v	1	*	Also, 538 did not show him at 3% chance. They consistently said Trump was unlikely to win, but still had a chance
t1_dsqacnq	0	*	You believe in the government? What a freaking loon.
t1_dsqjrj9	0	*	Because it's bullshit invented by blatant racists
t1_dsqc98v	0	*	It does in the eyes of the law but I agree with the overall observation about the difficulties in matching legality with ethics
t1_dsq6qne	0	*	Except that's not racist . It says prisoners can be used as slaves, not certain races.
t1_dsrwe79	0	*	Sorry, they sent mailers about this? Definitely did not get one about this. 
t1_dsq6gl3	0	*	Maybe it's neighbourhood/town specific? 
t1_dsqpxl1	0	*	It's like nobody took apart appliances and fucked around inventing stuff as a kid.   The rest of the story is B's but making fun of the kid for being interested in engineering is sad. 
t1_dsqpvkp	0	*	Well I know where your version of it sits I reckon. But youre completely right, how this current fucked up world is reality has left me more than a little lost.
t1_dsq5gzb	0	*	He committed suicide. He wasn't alive during the attack.
t1_dsq7kub	1	*	It's called projection.
t1_dsq8bey	1	*	Wow. When I was a kid we didn't have pencil cases anywhere near that nice.
t1_dsqj2sy	0	*	How do you equate arranged marriage with personal choice? 
t1_dsqrgua	1	*	You think he made a good point by responding to a claim that was never made?  Where have you seen people claiming that we're somehow more racist than in the 60's?
t1_dsq6kad	0	*	You're missing the part where he was just shit talking Obama for political points. It was a useless criticism of Obama and it's a useless criticism of Trump. 
t1_dsqbba3	0	*	Discounting the axiomatic presupposition that claims rendered truthful are done so by the examination of evidence, what kind of empirical proof would you say Hitch should have offered up?

t1_dsq6ss6	1	*	That's some real splitting of hairs 
t1_dsq6g18	0	*	You shouldn't, because that's social media, unless the post is MADE or sponsored by a news outlet. Otherwise I guess I'm a journalist 
t1_dsrwkb9	0	*	Conservatism has never had a history of being on the 'good' side of the fence on any topic. It's perpetual We like things the way they were, not the way they are.

t1_dsq83o3	0	*	What else would you call it? Thats a popular style of pencil case (or was like a decade ago anyway), and clearly pretty small judging from the cord
t1_dsq95du	0	*	Jesus the guy makes a 4 posts in T_D and you've just dismissed every single word he's said. Who are you to tell him how he thinks just for participating in a sub?
t1_dsq71rp	0	*	In my opinion, your willingness to make judgments on colloquialisms from someone else's culture is not that progressive.
t1_dsqk0ld	1	*	Yes.
t1_dsqlsbt	0	*	>fighting for the rights of others  in this case: giving cover to muslim theocrats, terrorists and criminals. How noble!  
t1_dsqf7hv	0	*	Sounds pretty American to me. 
t1_dsqeotl	1	*	The Gorilla Channel was someone's satire that no credible news source fell for. What is there to retract? Pissgate has been retracted?
t1_dsres84	1	*	That's up to you then. Keep in mind that's still a fraction of atheists, even there. It's not like the Christian religion doesn't deserve its share of hatred in some cases anyways.

t1_dssl81r	1	*	Oh shoot... I forgot about those experiences... I take it all back 
t1_dsrflux	1	*	How is it xenophobic and disparaging to grant  to groups of people the things the independence many among them have been aspiring to for a long time? I'll answer for you; it isn't.

t1_dsqdmgx	1	*	Yeah, which means shitting on Trudeau for being friendly with someone of the same party is overblown, isn't it?  If he had doubled the Canadian national debt now that would be a pretty good reason.

t1_dsqj3qt	1	*	You're delusional. Stop white knighting for an ideology that neither wants nor deserves your defending it.
t1_dsq7xy2	0	*	Everything you just said is completely unsubstantiated, conspiracy theory nonsense.
t1_dsq3zwq	0	*	Well, regardless of your feelings on islam, some man cutting an 11 year old's hijab *should* be met with sweeping condemnation 
t1_dsqhbqi	0	*	A motion is not a law. All M-103 says is the government should condemn Islamophobia and figure out how to collect information and reduce it. There's nothing in there about it being illegal.
t1_dsqjwv9	0	*	I'm not sure if you replied to the wrong post or were just continuing my question, but your confusion is mine.
t1_dsq6wyp	1	*	I guess it depends, I live and grew up in one of the most brown areas in the country and never heard anybody have a problem with that adjective. 
t1_dsq6fbs	0	*	Canadians don't refer to South East Asians (Thai, Cambodian, Vietnamese, etc) as brown, only South Asians (IE the Indian subcontinent).  Source: Am a brown Canadian.

t1_dsq6wlk	1	*	Your feeling is that the news can never be trusted. Take your own advice.
t1_dsq50s9	1	*	Yeah.... we are talking about Montreal.... 
t1_dsrbkc5	0	*	YOu could. but how would you know how many hoaxes there are? A lot of them are probably totally see trough and there never is a follow up, crimes on the other hand are recorded.

t1_dsr84vd	1	*	*they're
t1_dsq76hy	1	*	But it wouldn't make sense for Christians to get their own category, Christians would fall under Religion in Race/**Religion**/Ethnicity.

t1_dsqa2zm	0	*	So did those kids get kicked out of the house by way of the roof or are they still breathing?
t1_dst4i89	1	*	Oh ok, I think I misinterpreted the invented struggle they were talking about as the struggle against racism at large, rather than this fabricated incident. 
t1_dsq7mjb	0	*	Actually, in the app I use its impossible.  But keep those blinders on.  Willfully avoid information.  It also helps if you stick your fingers in your ears and hum.

t1_dsqwc97	0	*	I'd rather have half the leader Trudeau is to twenty of any of the other leaders in the West, at the moment.
t1_dsr9gbi	1	*	I mean I would've probably still included him if that was your reasoning given his popularity. I thought you didn't include him because he's an anti-establishment populist unlike the other examples.
t1_dsqraup	0	*	I mean, you could very well be retarded. We don't know you. 
t1_dssmx7j	0	*	So you were just adding a total non-sequitur to the conversation?

t1_dsqbpef	1	*	B-b-b-but you're p-p-positively inf-f-fantile
t1_dsq4oim	0	*	Anecdotal evidence from the majority of members of ethnic minorities seems like pretty good evidence that racism exists. Wilful ignorance isn't gonna hold up either. 
t1_dsq3sfv	0	*	It's funny. You guys can't decide whether you love Bill Burr because of his edgy commentary on feminism, or hate him because he recognizes that where there are white people, there is racism. 
t1_dsqb2p3	0	*	if youre 14 thats pretty cool

t1_dsq6xvf	1	*	You would think that, but if you look at Facebook comments by users you'd see they have no shame anyways
t1_dsqd7ko	1	*	So true, which is why you're getting downvotes from both sides of the aisle.
t1_dssin82	0	*	But most hoaxes dont get reported at all. Just some stupid kid wanting attention and everyone gets it and gives them a little, etc.
t1_dsqg5e6	0	*	And? They arrested his kid, scared the living daylights out of him, and his family who were afraid he would go to prison. Of COURSE he sued the school. I'm GLAD he sued the school. He should have!

t1_ds5cocy	1	*	That charge got thrown out, and now he's being charged with negligence leading to a patient's death .... in 2005!!!
t1_ds6o7pr	1	*	Ward Churchill for one. He's actually used the phrase in that context. Noam Chomsky, too, although he didn't put it that way or say that there is a 1:1 correlation.
t1_ds5maxy	0	*	That is where the operation was planned and terrorist trained. It was AQIs safe haven. 
t1_ds5ghsx	0	*	Was the patient suicidal?
t1_ds5b08e	0	*	Your logic makes no sense, if every party is an islamist party then no party is an islamist party?  Wars are generally punishment, why would a country take care of people it just declared war on?

t1_dsz71ew	1	*	He's just replying to every one of my comments, probably thru my user page, it's obnoxious.

t1_dt1c0op	0	*	It's good if you look at it as a union of several states. Not so much if you look at it as one giant country.
t1_dt1mqs0	0	*	No state claiming to be socialist, or even having mostly socialist properties, and with a better quality of life than the US exists. That's what the guy claimed, and it's BS.
t1_dt1g2uv	0	*	Does it advocate violence or stripping constitutional protections from anyone else? If yes, hate speech. If no, not. Seems pretty easy to me.

t1_dt1p3ao	1	*	Im not sure how any of that gets China to treat Hong Kong better. Wasnt that the original goal of this thread? To get China to follow the handover agreement? 
t1_dt3dxzd	0	*	I just want a 1000 member House.  Fixing the House size permanently a century ago gave them power not only in the Senate, but also in the EC and disproportionately in the House.

t1_dund9qn	0	*	Since I do speak Russian and do get all the information from the first hands, this so called anti-Russian propaganda has zero effect on me.
t1_duofuc8	1	*	Stupidity could explain a few of those things on their own, but all together, it's highly suspicious to say the least. There's a good reason that this is being investigated right now
t1_dunejqj	0	*	... you might want to look up a definition of the term whataboutism. 
t1_dursspz	0	*	Yeah. It seems most of their near constant wars on their borders are to support puppet regimes
t1_dun2pft	1	*	Those oligarchs run the country. Hell yeah they are pissed about their accounts being frozen. They want their money.  Russia is basically one big mob family.
t1_dtq3cyd	0	*	It's the implication.
t1_dtqokzn	1	*	You'd be wrong. It's a joke to think that r/Canada in any way represents the average Canadian.
t1_dtq5v24	0	*	season 2 is easily the worst season of the show. (that's the dock workers season, right?)
t1_dtq80xb	1	*	Same shit, different name!
t1_dtq907h	1	*	I feel the same way so I know you're going to LOVE The Deuce.
t1_dtqyfgh	0	*	Wow I super disagree, but to each his own I guess.
t1_dtqt3qu	1	*	Are you referring to Donald Sutherland?
t1_dtpx9wc	0	*	I hear they're the bomb
t1_dtq6eud	0	*	There is a question of guilt because those allegations have to be proven. 
t1_dtpugg5	0	*	Yeah, it's worth saying that a weak season of The Wire is still better than almost every other show in history.
t1_dtqlw1g	0	*	Easy tiger, you seem really heated over this. Relax a little. 
t1_dtqkoko	0	*	The case hasn't come to trial and many say for sure there must be racism and homophobia involved? The guy was gay and he killed a white man allegedly.  
t1_dtqfw8h	1	*	it is unfounded to accuse people of islamophobia baselessly. 
t1_dtrcot2	1	*	Thanks ya big lug, now give me a hug :3
t1_dtq6wn3	1	*	Everyone's situation is different.  I i understand your reaction, but that assumes an awful lot about what was going on in their head.
t1_dtq732v	0	*	Ah ok thanks. I guess that didn't register the first time I read the comments
t1_dtq495m	1	*	But they were callin' it Bin Laden last week?
t1_dtqfw3q	1	*	Not really. There were two white guys. One was quite publically missing, Andrew Kinsman. The other one wasn't. The attention came when Andrew Kinsman went missing. 
t1_dtpydam	0	*	Good luck in your recovery, friend!
t1_dtq7asc	1	*	Inb4 those people show up
t1_dsipx47	0	*	Which is ironic because A) He is being ignorant himself B) He is being ignorant in his opinion that no go zones aren't a thing. 
t1_duim5g1	0	*	hahaha ya im looking for stats not cute infographics.. you know like science?!? Im sure this wouldnt sway the minds of those who are asking for science backed facts
t1_duhlb4j	0	*	lol yeah right, hey guys we are literally going to legalize bribery with citizens united, that cool?   k
t1_duhpgo2	0	*	**I can see what you mean. I really sort of bold everything I have this Reddit+ extension that does it automatically.**
t1_duhsbvk	1	*	It was not.
t1_duhnn8w	1	*	Not most, but a disturbingly large amount yes 
t1_duhloxi	0	*	Thats okay, keep your guns. We have armoured vehicles and attack helicopters.  *your local PD*
t1_duhswlt	0	*	OP has drive.
t1_dui7grp	1	*	Way to fight the good fight.
t1_duhixg8	0	*	I learned on the history channel that they were made by aliens so no need to give Egyptians credit.
t1_duhpzhp	1	*	I dont want to prove them wrong, I just want to offer them my utter contempt at their gullibility at the hands of what I like to call junk science.
t1_duhnb1x	1	*	Isn't that basically the clathrate gun theory though? Hitting a point where all of the sudden it doubles itself?
t1_duhvwke	0	*	no  https://phys.org/news/2005-08-ice-sea.html
t1_duhtqop	1	*	you're right, i really don't know. at best i am an informed layman. i was being belligerent in my comment and i apologize.
t1_duhllpy	0	*	Not for long at this rate. The American left is begging to be stripped of arms. The same people who think Trump is Hitler want him to disarm them. 
t1_duhwca2	0	*	Not single-payer. Government health insurance is not the same as single-payer. Single-payer is a system where there is only one insurer. 
t1_dui6szc	0	*	You keep dancing. I asked if what you wrote is fact or is it one of the possible scenarios that may occur?  
t1_duhguth	0	*	Does she often joke by saying I appreciate the sediment, but...?
t1_duhk35h	0	*	True. But you'll have the most amazing life in America.
t1_duhofsd	0	*	LOL because I'm sure NO ONE is getting rich off of health care in those socialist states that Reddit loves.
t1_duhu8o6	0	*	Sure, but that industry doesn't exist anymore. Coverage cannot be denied, since the ACA banned that practice. 
t1_duj31dk	0	*	go back and fucking read my comments. stop asking me to repeat myself you goddamn child
t1_duho29w	0	*	Health insurance isn't a basic right.  Also, our quality of care is phenomenal. You just, you know, have to pay for it.
t1_duhji87	0	*	> Proper fucked.  Sorry, Im not a scientist, whats this mean in laymans terms??
t1_duhnubf	1	*	I'm in a major metro area and people around here ARE that nationalistic.  Where do you live that people aren't? 
t1_dvpogye	0	*	If your claim is that no unwitnessed event can ever be considered a fact, then you've already given up on the scientific process.
t1_duhkqd1	0	*	Right, like those pyramids in Central America... Oh, wait...
t1_duhpct6	0	*	As I keep telling Americans that make this argument, that ship has sailed people!  If you haven't risen up yet, you aren't going to.
t1_duhgu8m	0	*	Nah, we have 5 year old alcoholics in Australia too.
t1_duhpjzl	0	*	No it isnt and no they are not.  Their confidence interval is based on assumptions on top of assumptions combined with statistical machinations.
t1_duht0ah	1	*	at this point it's revolution or dystopia
t1_duho972	0	*	Inefficient? For the people that can afford it we have the best healthcare on earth. Its why the rich from other countries fly here to get treated.
t1_duhqi9r	1	*	No problem. u/harassment_survivor is an asshole. Anyway. Thanks for your service. 
t1_duhnvxu	0	*	Yet you are still a laymen attempting to question the work of experts in their field. 
t1_duiw2a1	0	*	https://www.bas.ac.uk/data/our-data/publication/ice-cores-and-climate-change/  
t1_duijrtr	1	*	But if youre that rich in america you dont have to pay as much taxes
t1_duhk2k3	0	*	I stand by what I said. I agree others are great.  I still think America is the best overall.  It blows the UK and Monaco out of the universe with house size/price just off the top of my head.
t1_duht8kz	0	*	And you sir have been reported.
t1_duhpcwt	1	*	In case .... Hahahhahaa...
t1_duhuag6	0	*	I'm just checking that you're aware that Shanghai and Hong Kong are not the same city, because the article you linked to clearly talks about Hong Kong...
t1_duhmhi1	1	*	It does because the woodpecker was lame...as in crippled.
t1_duikz04	1	*	No need for personal attacks 
t1_dujb4av	1	*	He said I'm not convinced I'm not that's too much. It's a double negative. 
t1_duhvz8n	1	*	I wonder if we are going to have a weird country where that is the only right remaining.  No privacy, no healthcare, no worker protection, no freedom of assembly, but you  CAN own a gun.
t1_duhskme	1	*	Yes
t1_duhth01	1	*	Its because he said something slightly edgy, therefore it must be bold to inform the simpletons 
t1_duhvfqe	0	*	I am not a Nazi, I never implied genocide to the human race. I implied reduction of life sustaining welfare to those with no merit. I +1 on the rest of your comment. The guy is a bit jaded. 
t1_duhjpjc	1	*	So were the others. Like ionheart said it's the only one standing because it's literally piled stone. Everything else cracked and fell apart.
t1_duj801o	0	*	It takes a special kind of stupid to do what you have just done...
t1_duhl9mb	1	*	Haha good one
t1_duhi831	1	*	Great band.
t1_dui028r	1	*	And many didn't, or didn't care. The poster kind of implies that people also acted on their wisdom with the little side note regarding some wonder of the ancient world.
t1_duhok31	1	*	This is true go to any sporting event no ones is singing the national anthem. They are still talking or looking on their phone. No one gives a shit.
t1_duhlvlp	0	*	Too fucking true. Meanwhile, the government pretty much *has* turned against us. But we get to have our guns so they can keep us distracted and killing each other while they gut the country for money.
t1_duhmrf0	1	*	>It's seeming more and more to me like the corruption of liberal institutions is inevitable ~~under capitalism.~~  FTFY
t1_dui28cs	0	*	Great example, except.. 2$ in those villages gets you enough for rent, 3x food a day, tuk-tuk/taxi money, etc. Looking at income alone is a bad thing.
t1_duhi19t	1	*	See you at the beach!
t1_duhpfj6	0	*	How is it already a gas? How is it trapped in the ice? Im dumb and have literally never thought to ask how this works.
t1_duhp9cm	1	*	By number? Yes. Bacterial cells are way smaller than human cells though so accounting for weight there's more of you than bacteria
t1_duhipbb	0	*	Have you a link to any of those refutations  because I'd really like to sleep well for once  this decade...
t1_duhinpi	0	*	California is where most of our food come from and corporate control of their local waterbank, somehow increased food production while the local residents has less water. 
t1_ducv511	1	*	And this is why we need election reform
t1_dsnn2n4	1	*	Lol, your just embarrassing yourself bro, crawl back to the T_d. 
t1_dsmqfsk	0	*	A trade war will hurt much more than our lumber industry. There is a lot to loose - and if we win in court (and history is on our side here) then we wont loose out on anything.
t1_dsmy7z6	0	*	From what I've gathered, Bombardier will continue manufacturing the C-series for the world while Airbus manufactures the C-series for the American market.  I say its a win.
t1_dsnxujq	1	*	Hey nice Whatabbout deflection!
t1_dsmr8ud	1	*	It wasn't a bailout, it was an investment. There's a difference. 
t1_dtc7uw0	0	*	[Penn and Teller has a good segment on it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7t2Ztb92mE) Like I said, the Dalai Lama is not the person most people see him as. 
t1_dtc5boi	0	*	Uh, they are still at war. It's unresolved. So it's an internal affair
t1_dtfo8i4	0	*	Ok in what way are the actions of Mao Zedong even tangentially related to what someone neant by the word purge?  Equally relevantly, Abraham Lincoln signed the emancipation proclamation.
t1_dtbwb3k	0	*	No but the British government does not like democracy.
t1_dtqmo3b	1	*	See my other response. Don't act like what the ZDF did had any reach at all. It was the (online, IIRC) announcement to a documentary that didn't even feature the phrase at all.
t1_dtpzuxg	0	*	Bad taste, good joke. Imperial japan was horrifying as an international power
t1_dtq5beb	0	*	Nope, just saying my opinions and getting made fun of.
t1_dtqsh9y	1	*	I'm not sure of the answer, but Jews sure do love Denmark. King Christian saved almost *every single Jew* in his realm from the Nazis.
t1_dtqn1s5	0	*	Eh, there isn't much there to proof your rejection. And I was basing myself on the work of Vassily Grossman describing Treblinka concentration camp and the documentary Shoa. 
t1_dtq5nbr	1	*	I live in a country where our conservative parties are more left leaning that the USA's democratic party. FN is very far right to me.
t1_dtsbs4g	0	*	I didn't see your post above, my bad.   I get that impression as Well, but I don't think it's possibly true. I hope Not, at least.
t1_dtqa6oo	0	*	not an argument
t1_dtqjk7d	1	*	Why the hell do you think that matters?
t1_dtrwg6o	1	*	No shit. Poles faced oppression from poles.   It's called post war communism where you're under the rule of assholes.   Get your shit together buddy and quit trying to find scapegoats 
t1_dtxmzzk	0	*	[yes, some of them did](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jedwabne_pogrom). Also you forgot to name which other European countries have similar laws
t1_dtoc4fh	0	*	Explore that site with links above - there are many other nice articles with links to historic books and events. Great talking to you too!
t1_dtoc0xb	0	*	Man, you are fast as a lightning ) Thanks for the link - I have downloaded it already )
t1_dtixbcg	1	*	The correct answer is... Oh, shut up!        -Monty Python 
t1_dsbub7k	1	*	Uh huh.
t1_dsc03u7	0	*	Why do we live where the air hurts our face? 
t1_duc2ze2	0	*	That's what i read year or so ago, can't find it now. It was about private mode sending a packet to google with your new id which could be used to join your non-private id with it.
t1_dsmsaki	0	*	Charging extra fees for nothing is a scam in my books
t1_dsms5rs	0	*	> Between 12 and 24 hours, which is a lot faster than the legacy banking system.  Maybe it's different in the US, but every bank I've used has made transfers basically instant.
t1_dsnotx9	1	*	That woman deserves a talking-to. 
t1_dsnpz7e	0	*	EU regulations limit credit to 0.3% and debit to 0.2%, both less than 0.5%. Of course, since the UK is leaving, this may change, but for now, yes, credit and debit are both cheaper.
t1_dsmm5h1	0	*	It's probably leading for higher (profit) margin products. If you get customer eyeballs in front of higher margin products at the expense of loss leaders, it's a win.
t1_dsmlzsj	1	*	Time is money friend. Even your own. I'm guessing not everyone has that luxury of passing the bank all the time. 
t1_dsmy297	0	*	It'd be a liability (debt), not a credit but in any case it doesn't matter. A bank is not a charity. Handling cash costs money, so it's charged for. 
t1_dsmrqx3	1	*	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XduHK6XRxSo  Watch how Walmart makes money on losing money on Milk and Eggs.
t1_dsmumpi	1	*	How fast can you count out ten dollars in cash? How fast can you count out 1000 dollars in cash?  That's not flat.  Taking cash requires lots of counting... multiple times. 
t1_dsmnhwh	0	*	Unless you're talking about extreme lower income, don't most people have a smartphone that can be used to make / receive payments 
t1_dsmul1e	1	*	Also on the hook for $20+ in fees whenever a fraudulent/stolen credit card is used and charge back is issued. 
t1_dsmm4s3	0	*	Thanks for the story?
t1_dsmoey4	1	*	The store takes the hit.
t1_dsn1zrj	0	*	It depends on how this law is written. It might no even be a criminal offence for this ban. Might be fined some money and enough complaints your CC merchant agreements and licencing might get pulled.
t1_dsmnjiq	0	*	The merchants still charge the business and the charges are built into the price you pay
t1_dtrzslj	0	*	I think forcing their hands, forces them to do worse shit actually. It just means they'll be looking for ways to subvert those regulations. 
t1_dtsgyuc	0	*	Palm oil is the oil gotten from the oil palm fruit. I don't think its classed as a soap. Both the palm fruit and the palm kernel are edible. 
t1_dueuc1f	0	*	I don't agree with what they were doing - but it shows that authorities could EASILY catch tons of pedophiles if this were not entrapment 
t1_dueoz1d	0	*	Oh okay, then start shutting the fuck up more often
t1_duepmzu	0	*	Then find us a single example of it, shouldn't be tough if it's so common
t1_dsj2bdg	1	*	I prefer to think of it as more the opposite, Feds don't want anything to do with Texas.
t1_dsi91pg	0	*	it was more of an evolution situation. my thoughts were, if there were ever a full anarchy that would quickly lead to the more basic feudalism.   \#TryToKeepUp 
t1_dsjc9mc	0	*	Thank you. Actions speak much louder than words when it comes to corporations. 
t1_dsij2xx	0	*	They dont though. They buy 'new to them cars.' Its not actually that common for somebody to buy a brand new car in comparison with total drivers in the US.
t1_dsivfj8	1	*	As I said earlier in this thread, I think substantially all private sector subsidies should stop, including agricultural subsidy.
t1_dsimiv1	1	*	Are tax credits not government subsidies? I know they are getting phased out, but they've been around.  Also a used leaf is $5000 and a free battery replacement if it drops 4 bars before 60k miles.
t1_dsjjc17	0	*	Who said regulation is unnecessary? I just said that divesting shares in a company means you surrender your influence over it, while purchasing more shares does the opposite.
t1_dsihdxf	0	*	I think he means, that a government could exist in a world with a free market. It would just mean that the government is limited to activities such as enforcing contracts. 
t1_dsj71u9	1	*	That is why people are pulling funds  Its not aultrism, they are risk adverse and dont want to be left with a large loss. So they go early and claim they are trying to save the planet ;)
t1_dsj1t1i	1	*	> Or like we did with CFC's to save the ozone.  Uh I mentioned that.  Please look into the Montreal Protocol.
t1_dsik6sj	0	*	> What if they did get subsidies towards their lines of electric cars  What are you talking about? They do...
t1_dsiphpr	0	*	any estimate of kgCO2/kW (or kW/kgCO2)? also dry volume of algae?
t1_dsiup9e	1	*	I never said that.
t1_dsii6nw	0	*	I wish petrol was that cheap :(
t1_dsibdwp	0	*	a lot of you snowflakes are missing where i said on all those issues in the next sentence. But why would i expect a Trump supporter to read an entire post without just responding in a nazi rage
t1_dshv0jt	1	*	Or maybe you are the real troll! Wait maybe its me? Quite the rabbit hole we have here.
t1_dshtx6r	0	*	>passed the Turing Test  the fuck it matters for a chat bot  >Don't blab about things beyond your understanding.  excellent advice, follow it.
t1_dshgmgp	0	*	Trump is the only thing keeping Twitter afloat.  Interest in his account alone has given the stock a marginal uptick after years and years of uninterrupted declines.
t1_dsid04x	0	*	why does russian want any war to happen with their ally iran 
t1_dshhoo8	0	*	Don't forget to add mint privileges before you do that.
t1_dsi48gu	1	*	if you could read, you'd see i said on all those issues
t1_dsipskh	1	*	You missed every other point and went straight to the one regarding your name. Way to make it looks like you've lost. 
t1_du1j6oa	0	*	The recent election would like to have a word with you.
t1_du1bdeu	1	*	And apparently Taiwan loves China now lmao
t1_du108d7	1	*	You didn't read what I wrote, but then again, you do actually believe what you're saying. That's amazing. 
t1_du1krdp	0	*	North Korea does not yet have a functioning nuclear icbm. I am very glad you are not in charge of our foreign policy.
t1_du1cji6	1	*	Exactly. That's like negotiating 101
t1_du2103j	0	*	This is a reference to Obama.
t1_du18gis	0	*	The UK? Unchanged since the civil war. Or 1066.
t1_du1ii2w	0	*	Did I say the DPRK are the good guys? Maybe you should read a few history books yourself and you'll see the world is more complex than a Hollywood Western of white hats vs black hats.
t1_du1gxss	1	*	That was back when the USA would harbour you if you were a fascist dictator, and the USSR if you were a Communist one.   KJU has managed to piss off literally every other country on the map. 
t1_du2m1dr	1	*	Maybe fair. I dunno, I'm not sold. I can't help but feel like there's better explanations for it, but I don't know for sure.
t1_du1axr0	0	*	Can you link me to this profile? Maybe it's someone using a VPN? 
t1_du1w8dy	0	*	UH, read it and weep: http://www.nytimes.com/1994/10/19/world/clinton-approves-a-plan-to-give-aid-to-north-koreans.html?pagewanted=all
t1_du1emwl	0	*	The US and China has basically achieved an economic version of MAD, no one wants what will happen if that partnership crumbles.
t1_du1pfjw	0	*	Good thing every male above 13 is considered a combatant, otherwise there would be more reported civilian casualties. 
t1_du1bxj3	1	*	> Peace with SK is not the same as unification.  Unity would almost completely remove US military interest in SK. Peace would, as I said, reduce it.
t1_du18ioh	1	*	The UK? Unchanged since the civil war. Or 1066.
t1_du2i9yn	1	*	Tibet is China's thanks to Mongols and Manchus that assimilated into China.
t1_du1zbgu	1	*	Weve been playing the sanction game for 30+ years and it didnt work. It doesnt really matter what we do now because they have nukes.   
t1_du1bjq6	0	*	Were trying out teams now. It seems a bit bloated, but Ill withhold judgment for now. 
t1_du2obe8	1	*	If it wasnt for those pesky kids
t1_du1yxdm	1	*	>Better the US dealt with them than Iran or China  Really? Why - how did that work out for us?
t1_dtixuib	0	*	If you are getting same amount of stuff then wtf does spending more mean? You just want the number on the money to be bigger? How does that make American stuff more affordable to Mexicans 
t1_du87bf2	0	*	>We know peer review is proven to be corrupted by a lack of independent motivation.  No we dont. You claiming something does not make it so. 
t1_du8g49o	1	*	2%. So, 2% over 5 years so basically nothing.
t1_dsre3ky	0	*	To Americans it is apparently
t1_dsrpjq6	0	*	In a vacuum one on one the US can destroy any European country. It's not even a contest. It's that way by design sorry  
t1_dssg3dg	1	*	It looks like Google doesn't have the answer any better than you do, which is the whole point. They haven't made any changes. It was never about making changes. It was about pandering to his base.
t1_dsrzuh7	1	*	I agree, Its not up to me unfortunately.
t1_dt43chj	1	*	Well for one, canada is much more popular internationally than the us
t1_dsedb7a	1	*	Technically immortal I suppose, as long as nothing too bad happens. But corporations are dissolved all the time.
t1_dsedu5f	1	*	Lol, no new set of policies. It's the same old shit wrapped up in a fancy package. Nothing has changed. It's just people blindly believe in appearances and hype.
t1_dtvqpzl	0	*	Its not that you misspoke, it's more that you're displaying your ignorance of the situation.
t1_dtvskad	0	*	Try and find space if you can. This bulge is hefty. You can give me slow strokes to the fantasy of our president fighting for the middle class.
t1_dtvq85k	0	*	Ever heard of the phrase The evidence doesn't exist yet because no one has done the groundwork to gather the evidence to cite on the internet?
t1_dtvysc4	0	*	I voted for Hillary and am a Democrat. You have no evidence to back any of your claims and are in complete denial. 
t1_du0rypw	0	*	Still can not be questioned about what they say on the floor.  
t1_du0pqxl	0	*	Where theres a will. Sorry if I came off assholish.
t1_dupteo6	0	*	It's still 2-3000 of them, it's still enough to be suicide by your own weapons. Oh look the yield is smaller, I guess we will only be dead 20 times over instead of 100 times over. 
t1_durxghv	0	*	wtf does that even mean
t1_dv0glt6	0	*	Partially because they won't shoot their countrymen, and certainly partially because it would be horrific waste of lives to do so.
t1_dv07h1f	0	*	Are you that big of a dotard that you think a gun up and decides to kill a kid so you're going to defend the revocation of my right? Fuck off.
t1_dv0gwx0	0	*	I have to say I don't have a ton of experience with our touristy areas. For us, thanking a serviceman is a simple display of respect, similar to thanking a policeman or fireman.
t1_dv3psil	1	*	You know exactly how many Australians with stashed weapons to base this off? I had family members turn in weapons during the amnesty. They didnt have any ammunition. Or anyway way to get more. 
t1_dv0g9er	0	*	1/1000th... Do you see ISIS fighting with Abrams Tanks, or Predator drones? They are fighting with AKs and Toyota trucks. A second civil war in the United States would be fought with ARs, not Abrams.
t1_dv0f7u4	1	*	It doesn't, thats a straw-man.  Americans seem to think that guns are 100% outlawed in most other western countries, even though that is simply false. 
t1_dv0h6n2	0	*	Do you really think they will us them against there own people? Their wives, husbands, brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts, fathers and mothers?
t1_dt31hnk	0	*	Holy American mental gymnastics.        I guess you are going to insist that US has no responsibility in Iraq or Libya being the way they are either, yeah?     
t1_dt31t96	0	*	He's rocking back and forth humming really loudly now because of you.
t1_dsprybf	0	*	I guess there isnt space for one in VC? 
t1_dt2knrg	0	*	Hes not a known liar. You just dont admit hat you were wrong. 
t1_dt2axvf	0	*	and Israel as a nation has the entire right to be Jewish or not. If they refuse to recognize this right, then they are not really recognizing Israel.
t1_dt2xvd6	1	*	Meanwhile at Rabin's grave...  Just imagine what Oslo could have been if Netanyahu didn't incite more murder. It's just too difficult for him to resist.
t1_dt2jsrh	0	*	> Thats why Israel doesnt do it.  That's not why, please stop lying.
t1_dsfhsza	1	*	I would vote for you

t1_dt4d0mc	0	*	Make government weed smoking lounges in high volume areas. The areas would pay for themselves with the high end vending machines inside them. 
t1_dt57s70	0	*	Damn I didn't realize that. I guess I assumed smoking on a balcony was okay because the idea that it isn't is just so fucking stupid and outlandish I never even considered it a possibility. 
t1_dt4sbj5	1	*	Well then you'll be pleased to know that balconies are not under consideration for public use. You can smoke marijuana on them. It's already been confirmed by the Ontario government. 
t1_dupaf9g	0	*	Yes, the land claims are literally people who owned land , who have proof, who were chased from their land. There are thousands of cases, which need to be addressed on a case by case basis.
t1_dultdsv	0	*	Yeah...If that were true, you probably would've kept your mouth shut. Huh, bud?
t1_dtcszyt	1	*	Yeah, you don't think Jews do any racial violence? Ever heard of Israel? 
t1_dtcufhc	1	*	No but compared to a few decades ago, yes. KKK used to be massive but that was a century ago.
t1_dtcdbv0	1	*	Got it. 
t1_dtevwmj	0	*	Have you been doubling down on your posts about wanting to attack Nazis? Yeah, at some point you've got to assume that you're being honest.
t1_dtcpcjd	1	*	A very well put comment. 
t1_dtcmopr	1	*	> Well this shit happens every week in Europe.  Oh?
t1_dsk6hat	1	*	the stories are horrifying....this one about a mother and baby being bayoneted and dying is onions.   https://youtu.be/jfkk-GtM_sI#t30m25s
t1_dsjtgef	0	*	Didn't know that the US dropped two nuclear bombs on Japan after WWII. Care to elaborate ?
t1_dsjkz9e	1	*	That is true. 
t1_dsk6ecf	0	*	Im not trying to me rude, but saying that the truth is always in the middle is called the fallacy of the mean https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_to_moderation
t1_dsk2b53	1	*	The only thing worse than the Japanese were the Communists. Better dead than red, they say. 
t1_dsjtoib	0	*	They wouldn't surrender. Also DOD estimates suggested a naval invasion would have killed millions of Japanese. So yeah the bombs gave the Emperor the excuse he needed to surrender.
t1_dsjj2ey	0	*	The one with the poor man who was exposed to massive amounts of radiation haunts me. The callousness and indifference to horrific suffering really shakes ones faith in humanity 
t1_dsk4hui	0	*	That's an outright lie.
t1_dsk9fb4	0	*	I never said denial, I just said it isn't typically covered.  Most Americans I've mentioned it to also have no idea. I bet few even realize we fought the Spanish in the Philippines.
t1_dsjr5fq	0	*	The only ever legitimate opinion on that is that perhaps by dropping it only once or in the ocean it may force them to surrender. But that's it. Invading Japan instead of nuking is a stupid argument.
t1_dsk2mpg	1	*	Just explaining how I think its funny that the USA is a laughing stock  sorry if my swearing made you think I'm angry lol
t1_dskvcs1	0	*	Nor was I.  
t1_dsjz4sp	1	*	Humanity, just the worst. Although the Japanese were the most atrocious, the Americans have also been known for doing some fucked up shit in the past. 
t1_dsjr8kr	0	*	serious question: do you know how stupid you sound?
t1_dsjvagk	1	*	Ya talking medical.   Even non-medical I'm not aware of Japan contributing much of anything, although non-medical your right Germans did.  
t1_dsjsaed	0	*	False dicothomy, there were a lot of options between invadin japan and nuking civilians
t1_dsjc3x3	1	*	I know, don't you worry.
t1_dsjmcy9	0	*	Oh great. We've reached THAT point now...
t1_dsk4hip	0	*	It certainly wasn't from mine. You can definitely make the argument that maybe not enough time was spent on what it was and what it represents, but it certainly wasn't glossed over either.
t1_dsjai0n	0	*	Did you not realize it's a different person this time who responded? It's some other guy
t1_dsk2dki	1	*	yeah, below -30 celsius when leaving the pub sobers you up like nothing else haha
t1_dskgir7	0	*	The Germans raped people at a similar magnitude during their invasion of the Soviet Union. They also had their own version of comfort women as well.
t1_dslgzdj	0	*	While the history book isnt exactly condemning of the event, Ill admit I was wrong. Good shit finding it. 
t1_dskno7h	1	*	ahh I get it.  :)
t1_dstdf5d	1	*	The allies campaign lasted as long as the axis campaign...   > The Allies Campaign didnt last long enough to permit even the possibility of this notion being true.  Don't think you know wars work...  
t1_dsjfmfw	0	*	And war was the means the military used to affirm that ideology through hegemony. And during war they did a lot more nasty things.
t1_dskbvpp	0	*	Which is worse is an academic and ultimately meaningless question.  
t1_ds9xkj8	1	*	O to give himself a tax break.
t1_dsa0er7	0	*	So if I disagree with anything you say, I can call it a lie, then attack your family? I mean, it is your fault after all, you said things I disagree with.
t1_ds8ik7j	0	*	If your business model can't sustain a living wage, maybe something is wrong with your model.
t1_ds9fa84	0	*	Yeah McCafxe9 is definitely a thing here. But Tims is more prominent, partially because its a Canadian image thing. 
t1_dsac3ix	1	*	So nudge your prices up enough to recoup 52k then?
t1_ds8av0s	0	*	If you are a working a position that requires minimal skill (hence minimum wage) demanding a living wage then we need to reevaluate the meaning of skilled labor. 
t1_ds890uu	0	*	such aggression! People go from zero to 100 here.   When operating a business and being concerned about income, then paying wages is an enormous factor. Finding the balance between the two is key.
t1_dsjve4c	1	*	Increases are % based, not fixed. They didn't raise minimum wage by 75 cents 50 years ago, they aren't going to raise it by 75 cents 200 years from now.
t1_ds8alo0	1	*	An upvote for integrity!
t1_ds9e3ch	1	*	Oh, abso-freaking-lutely...

t1_ds881wq	0	*	Since when did private businesses become responsible for all these people?
t1_ds8y8yh	1	*	i too noticed a decline in happiness since i started using reddit! 
t1_dsaa8b4	0	*	I'm not advocating for any Ontario provincial political party. I'm clarifying who exactly brought in the wage increase mandate to $15/hr in Alberta.
t1_ds8l23v	0	*	But you'd be saving probably 5 minutes from the drive thru line. I'll make that trade any day of the week.
t1_ds9fvxu	0	*	huh? i am canadian and occasionally i do have a timmy, but that's all. it's just coffee.
t1_ds93bsm	1	*	Then there's that whole I'm not always home thing...
t1_ds8asdh	1	*	Very true! THEY do. In more ways than just wages as well... so a forced wage increase has rippling effects...  
t1_ds8gfoe	0	*	You've lived a blessed life and can't imagine anyone could have it worse than you.  That explains a lot.  It is fairly standard for the people fighting against a living wage.
t1_ds8web9	0	*	Even if they automate it, it doesnt provide any bonus to the consumer as they are just going to keep their prices the same.
t1_ds9pq3u	0	*	You are usually coming directly from home.
t1_ds8gmug	0	*	It seems common sense then that if so much has changed then minimum wage would be no different.
t1_ds88qya	1	*	I am sure the IRS and his employees didnt. 
t1_ds8dger	0	*	How do you propose to get investment money  in the first place if you go in saying 'fuck shareholders' and put them on the bottom of the ladder? Nobody would trust you with their investment money.
t1_ds88vwz	1	*	Agree on the last sentence! I am trying to find a business to start that I like... to not have a boss.   Kudos to you then. 
t1_ds91kxu	0	*	Deconstructed coffee exists....so yea.
t1_ds8vnsx	0	*	Wouldn't automation and technological advances be largely responsible for that as opposed to unskilled labor?
t1_dthuglo	0	*	Right, at least we can agree that in the 19th century people worked longer than they did today.   I'm curious. Do you have any reference to how much people worked in hose periods?
t1_dthkbk7	0	*	Well unlike you I guess, I had parents that forbade watching any television or playing video games. I would say that that decision was the single most beneficial choice my parents could have made
t1_dtjkq7r	1	*	It's automatically done via same email. Otherwise they'd not be able to truly know.  Then again, how many people use multiple email addresses?
t1_dtj8b6k	1	*	Its a boy? I hope your GP gives out coupons for Ritalin 
t1_dthykjk	1	*	Kind of creepy but I really appreciate the supportive data analysis.
t1_dtirrgi	0	*	Not my fault ur too label to Google it. Also I didn't really make a claim so much as I said if you do research yourself... and implied negative effects
t1_dtczvfx	0	*	We should charge oil execs with crimes against humanity for poisoning the planet, then we should eat them.  
t1_dtcyx6i	0	*	Yeah, he'd have all the world leaders lined up while he's on his knees, mouth agape, ready to continue doing what he did for the past 8 years. 
t1_dtd56r6	0	*	How about we hold all people to the same standards? 
t1_dtem0ge	1	*	Yeah, I am fully aware of my privilege. But I can't stop laughing at Trump and his army of mouthbreathing dunces.

t1_dtcz6hd	0	*	To be fair, the Northern ice caps have been growing and are now the biggest they have been since about April of 2017.
t1_dtd6y0u	1	*	What's unfortunate is when people think the President of the United States and some random redditor should be held to the same standard of accountability. 
t1_dtdgytr	0	*	In Baseball maybe.
t1_dtd1m6o	0	*	What a strange comment. What DO you care about? What topics are not a waste of time? 
t1_dtcycyx	0	*	Can't wait for some 'democrats are just as bad' now that you said that.
t1_dtd30cv	1	*	False. If renewables got the same subsidies as oil, coal, and nuclear, we'd have already phased those three out and be saving the planet. 
t1_dtd1ydn	0	*	Let's go with the entire destruction of the Netherlands, for starters.
t1_dtczhmc	1	*	They are not only profoundly stupid, but also simply wrong. The only thing that is left for debate is whether they are doing it on purpose, or are actually that stupid.
t1_dtd1n0d	1	*	For starters both the Gulf Stream and the Jet stream would switch off- plunging much of Europe into a very short growing season. 
t1_dtg32kl	0	*	It wasn't 15 years without an increase. Did you look at the chart in the link I posted?
t1_dtdbjf7	1	*	That would have to be part of the package, yes
t1_dtdampf	0	*	 Eh, public schools are actually really decent overall. With the notable exception of some urban schools. 
t1_dtcy9oo	1	*	Considering the now hundred or so Obama era climate and environment regulations rolled back by Trump, it doesn't seem so.
t1_dtd0eiu	0	*	Fortunately in America, all of these businesses just got huge tax cuts they can use to help transition over.  
t1_dtd6ngr	1	*	No, seriously, you're supposed to mix the kool-aid with water and drink it occasionally, not rip open the packs and stuff it up your nose.
t1_dtdn500	1	*	I figured this was probably it. Sad. :(
t1_dtd0sus	0	*	Everyone realizes that Obama can't be president again right? There's a term limit of 2 terms for any one person that's it. He can't take a brake for a couple of years and then go again.

t1_dtdmu8s	0	*	That's  not portraying him as a sociopath that's acknowledgement of the fact that people give  themselves or highlight  character traits to achieve goals. 
t1_dtcznsz	0	*	Lol and democrats like to murder American babies (aka real dreamers) the cognitive dissonance is so real. Just mentioning this because both parties have deleterious outlooks in various issues.

t1_dt8we2t	1	*	I agree, i am not criticizing them.
t1_dt8pfok	0	*	Boys doing better is sexism.  Girls doing better is because they are better.  Equality!
t1_dtek7c2	1	*	Is that your only goal in conversation?
t1_dt9pbop	0	*	It doesn't matter. It was given to everyone and the problem was when people thought it was extra help for women only and tchanan, it wasn't! Good news everybody.
t1_dt8vz2s	0	*	Then maybe they should start going into STEM degrees.
t1_dt8t3ta	0	*	...

t1_dtaimce	1	*	I only said it in that manner because they appeared to have an attitude in the way they asked it, then he posted a load of legitimate sources. 
t1_dt9yjxr	0	*	Brought them down to girls level?  Jesus Christ 
t1_dt94yhh	0	*	So you think Oxford just lets students in at random?
t1_dt9ls08	1	*	> routine managerial and secretarial tasks, while the men went off with the interesting, actual engineering stuff.  Become a professor and you get to do all of them at once!
t1_dt9kl0t	0	*	Its great having a ManCar that never breaks down, and a ManBody that never gets sick or dies. #man
t1_dt96yyw	0	*	Does it have to be in the article? They are literally giving women more time for exams.
t1_dt9hvqf	0	*	Ive never reaped the benefits of anything youre talking about. Please tell me how I personally have perpetuated these alleged advantages.
t1_dt8w5jw	0	*	That just means the problem is throughout the entire education system and not suddenly appearing at the college level.
t1_dt9krgs	0	*	Trump was right about the Mexicans.
t1_du51mvd	0	*	>  all Muslim states are dictatorships.  Umm depends on what you mean by Muslim states because Indonesia is 80-90% Muslim and have a constitutional republic. 
t1_duibncx	1	*	This, it's about the *value* you offer.
t1_dui95a8	0	*	yeah, I live in a huge ass 2 story house with attached garage for 950 a month, so it's all about location. 
t1_duibi0d	0	*	Are you really calling the Gates Foundation virtue signallers?  God I'm really gonna be glad when that phrase isn't the flavour of the month anymore. 
t1_dui8mrv	0	*	What happened to the days of living off of one income?  Is that not included in the conservative ideal view of going back to the 1950s?  
t1_dui7t6w	0	*	Corporate taxes are simply passed onto the consumer.  You think they'll simply accept lower profit? 
t1_dui8vbz	1	*	Didn't Trump write off a 900 million dollar loss against his taxes? I guess this not 'capital gains'? 
t1_duiiwef	0	*	Not everyone. My family has a total out of pocket max of $3,000/year. After that 100% of all medical costs and medications are paid for by insurance 
t1_dui9aw8	0	*	But where the fuck are the boots? 
t1_dui90hs	0	*	I would think it depends on where you live, where are you from? 
t1_dui6dgu	0	*	I'm sure there are lots of billionaires that are good guys. The problem is billionaires. 
t1_duik4d4	0	*	It's fair because it's more than what he makes.  If he made a few hundred thousand dollars I would bet you that 90%+ would suddenly become a bit excessive.
t1_dui6irq	0	*	I know many people that have lawn mowing businesses, general handyman businesses, and painters.  There's probably more than you would think 
t1_dui9cvk	0	*	Except you're missing the fact that the $100 was invested with after tax money to begin with...
t1_dui7ndx	0	*	What do they call the man who graduated at the bottom of his med school class?  Doctor.  Do what you have to do and good luck bro. 
t1_dui9io2	1	*	No problem. There's always an exception to the rule in tax
t1_dui8o0v	1	*	You are correct. 
t1_duibcpy	0	*	On the flip side, items that have a fixed cost such as technology, cars, etc become comparatively more affordable for the high income/high rent areas.
t1_dui79fx	0	*	E.g., Mafia
t1_duibzhj	0	*	I was addressing the sarcasm due to the amount of money he's made off that loan. Too many ignorant people with too little knowledge of business and numbers trying to spew the typical Reddit bullshit.
t1_duikv8u	1	*	Donate it to the government. He wants his peers to give up their cash he should set the example. 
t1_dui9rxt	0	*	...? You just said it there, thousands. Nobody needs multiple millions.
t1_dui9oiz	0	*	That's part of the reason. The rest of the reason is as I mentioned. 90% is a huge incentive to cheat or stretch the loopholes.
t1_duid6ql	0	*	Sources needed.
t1_duic9tv	0	*	Your comment has not changed my opinion about people from Sarnia. 
t1_duiapd5	0	*	And how does a flat tax that negatively affects those below you seem any better than a more effective progressive tax that focuses primarily on the mega wealthy? 
t1_duib78b	0	*	Faults of human corruption. Not a social economic system.
t1_dui6t6y	0	*	Yes, a condo.
t1_dui9fsn	0	*	> For instance, the CEO of MGM had a special entry made to cover his bonus one year and make it tax exempt  Damn I didn't even know that. That's really fucked. 
t1_dui9d06	0	*	That's because a lot of idiots only vote for what they are told to vote for and with more money means you can tell more people what to do.
t1_duiht63	1	*	Yes.
t1_dui7q3w	0	*	So, it's your belief that people don't buy things that are taxed?  Alcohol? Gasoline? Sales taxes in general?  
t1_duiam77	0	*	but, that is just considering the salary and cost of living. After you pay taxes, health care,car and utilities, that 150k becomes more like 50k.
t1_duilnto	1	*	Well isnt that nice? 
t1_duii4qv	0	*	Life isn't fair.  I say that as a member of that income bracket.

t1_dui99eq	0	*	CPA = can't pass again
t1_duibb41	1	*	Or something like a group of nations or a *United Nations*.   Obviously its nothing like that atm, but the essence is there. 
t1_dui7gjg	0	*	Why not just have a simplified tax system rather than one that results in unintended consequences 
t1_dui9adm	1	*	Family of four, not four kids.
t1_dui9lq3	0	*	Sounds more like you are afraid someone might notice all the broken backs you steped on to secure your childrens future beyond reason. 
t1_duibfiw	0	*	I know the difference, now educate me on what Obama did to reduce the deficit
t1_duia1v4	0	*	At the same time though living in the city is a choice and there are very few jobs in the city that are not found in cheaper locations in the world. 
t1_dui9dso	1	*	Today, there's nowhere near as many deductions as there were back then. 
t1_dui9jje	0	*	He didnt do it to impress Lisa - he didnt even let her see what it was. He didnt need to impress Lisa, hes the future King of Zamunda!
t1_dui8q3o	0	*	Um... can I have one of these 75k jobs everyone has? A working family of 4 might be making that combined, and substantially less if they can't afford child care so can't work full time. 
t1_dui8bsh	1	*	Mark Cuban is also the inspiration the the Tres Commas guy, so IDK.
t1_dui8u37	1	*	Wait a minute...
t1_dui9rjl	1	*	Aww someone got twiggered so they needed to spwite downvote like a lil baby.  Awllll because they couldn't read.
t1_dui7967	0	*	5 or 10 grand in profit on investment typically means at least 10x that in the money being invested though. That's a lot
t1_duiavxm	0	*	iirc theyre counted as income, just not wages.  dont hang me if im wrong
t1_dui8wmc	0	*	Nah, that just cause of the feminism /s
t1_duicc07	0	*	Probably $500,000 and have it be a progressive tax and somehow make an exception for family farms because those people are land wealthy but nobody would claim that farmers are rich.
t1_duic8vt	0	*	I think they're referring to his upbringing (leader from a poor background) rather than how much money he earned as an adult. 
t1_duiesja	1	*	No.
t1_dui9czs	0	*	If you happen to come out with a profit the you've made good on your gamble, no?  If you invest money you do so with the guise that you may lose it all, no?  Is this not gambling?  
t1_duigmq6	1	*	What is bipartisan about the budget?
t1_duibb01	1	*	10% is a lot though.
t1_dui5jt8	1	*	get fucked
t1_dui8rjr	0	*	Just wanted to point out that SS benefits are paid by tax on current workers and definitely are not individual accounts.
t1_duibj4k	0	*	Im sure rich people living near one another could split the costs. Have shared armies. Wouldnt be too crazy expensive.
t1_duib9yw	0	*	The people who dont pay taxes?  Who the hell are you talking about, Al Capone?
t1_duia8vu	0	*	Where do the people who make minimum wage live that work in NYC? Where do they eat? I doubt they travel 3hrs a day to get to mcds. Maybe they do idk. 
t1_dui9gw9	1	*	> No one here is sure of what argument you're trying to make  Oh, sorry. I didn't realize that you were the only one here.
t1_dui8lgj	0	*	Over half of all Am earn less than $30k a year, so most two-income families will not make anywhere close to $150k per year. 
t1_dui941w	0	*	waging war has a high correlation to economic growth(assuming you come out victorious). I seriously doubt the tax system had much, if any, to do with it  
t1_duihcor	1	*	How so? And is it an equally bullshit way to look at lack of success? (Also, how are we defining success - I assume financially?)
t1_duimw5b	0	*	What are you talking about? Did you not read the thread? It's a hypothetical discussion. 
t1_dui1lii	0	*	If you get mkre than you pay for then what you didn't pay for was free.
t1_dui96ro	0	*	Nobody should feel sorry for people in the 150k range, but IMO that's also the wrong range to go after for substantial tax increases.
t1_duigrda	0	*	Yeah? Why not?
t1_dui9chq	0	*	Thats the issue. That should not be considered doing decently and you should not have to deal with that.
t1_dui9bm3	0	*	These statistics...uh...don't really look very good, you know?
t1_dui8ely	0	*	 Absolutely. I mean, private jet = potable water.  Who knows who is wealthy 
t1_duia5yz	1	*	No. Higher.   
t1_dui7g69	0	*	Cool man, you're doing something really great and that's awesome. People still shouldn't pay less tax on activities that offer society very little. 
t1_dui98b2	1	*	My husband and I each have 2 jobs.  Household income is 120k.
t1_duic6ys	0	*	Hello, strawman, my old friend. It's nice to see you once again.  When did I say all households should have an estate tax? I would be fine with 1 out of every 100.
t1_dui9p1j	0	*	You are paying for it either way. 
t1_duib8hd	1	*	Nah, it was the 80s. It was the Reagan years. It was about *winning*. And if you could win at the expense of someone else, even better. 
t1_dui9j3k	1	*	Nobody said he's perfect. He's a brilliant entrepreneur and an incredibly important figure in the world right now. But he's no saint and nobody should be worshipping him.
t1_dui8lv1	0	*	What? Do you think everyone who works in the city makes on average 75k?  I grew up in NYC, and even putting aside the minimum wage/no higher education population, that is not the case AT ALL.
t1_duib6dt	1	*	That wasnt really the point, though. Its more that a high tax burden is going to hurt this range of earners more than those making multiple hundred thousands a year more. 
t1_dui94fc	0	*	Not only capped, but the benefit tapers off toward the top. So people who put in the minimum are paid proportionally more than people who put in the max.
t1_duib8zo	0	*	Ah, this explains why California and NYC have no businesses, I suppose, and why PR is such an economic powerhouse.
t1_dui8c5i	1	*	I got 90 on my first test and 80 on my last. There was a learning curve in how much I needed to study. The first test I mustve studied 40 hours on top of 40 hours at work.
t1_dui50jw	0	*	Any suburb around indy has awesome public schools. I think there's several that rank higher than any private school in the state.  Indianapolis is the 14th largest city in the country. 
t1_duia2aw	1	*	They were higher, but they weren't *much higher*. 
t1_dui9dix	0	*	Edited to fix mistakes
t1_duk565e	0	*	Education is not a thing, at least technically
t1_dui9fni	1	*	Depends where you are living.
t1_duiph2k	1	*	> Already got the D..   Oh yeah!? How was it?! Do tell U0001f917
t1_duici66	0	*	Then stop acting like it prevents wealthy people from earning more. There is no cap on how much you earn. 
t1_dui8q1v	1	*	Even with 2 parents I don't necessarily see how this is the case?
t1_duiluf5	1	*	I changed my original comment. I completely messed up the amount. My bad.
t1_duig40q	1	*	Hi :/ Los Angeles Resident
t1_dui86hs	1	*	It's not like the other one was justified either.
t1_duiak15	1	*	Or have children. 
t1_duiao8x	0	*	You deduct $ from your taxable income, not % from your marginal tax rate.  Am I misunderstanding your comment? It's definitely not right the way I'm reading it.
t1_duidaua	0	*	And where are the quotation marks, Johnny?
t1_duia6so	0	*	Please be nothing like the convoluted US system.
t1_duidjuz	1	*	socialism never took hold in America because the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires  Seems applicable here
t1_duidbsx	0	*	I mean, it's a euphemism to describe how small their marginal tax rates are compared to individuals that lack the means to capitalize on such strategies. 
t1_duiispp	1	*	If they want to live in the now and keep working until they die, more power to them. I'm saving like crazy and will retire early 
t1_duigtbp	1	*	Too bad we're already playing this mode...how do I lower the difficulty?
t1_duikd7g	1	*	In a capitalist society, absolutely. In reality, not so much.
t1_duijg5e	0	*	But that won't allow him/her to express their moral superiority! 
t1_duiknm3	1	*	Nope, they're both ours.  Born with special needs.
t1_duibahn	1	*	Local cost of living os definitely an overriding factor. 100,000 a year would let you live like nobility here but would be barely scraping by in and around major cities like Chicago, New York, etc.
t1_duirmyz	0	*	So what do you call the area that separates north/south jersey?  
t1_dui9c6l	1	*	People who worked hard and earned their billions have more empathy than those who inherited everything and gave never been poor...probably.
t1_duib1fd	1	*	Yes its not a bad situation to be in of course, but your tax burden is still going to be more consequential to your lifestyle than it is to those making upwards up 250/350k. 
t1_duibb52	0	*	When you have that much money it's not that much harder.
t1_dui9u8a	0	*	The fear is that this will stifle any but the safest investments. Theres definitely some validity to that claim but exactly how stifling itd be is difficult to judge. 
t1_duie7n7	0	*	After-tax income, for one.  
t1_dui9z5h	0	*	Good luck. Tryna start on my CFA soon
t1_dui7zdb	0	*	You're missing the part where the markets and economy crashed after the sept 11 attacks  I don't like Bush 2 any more than the next guy but you're being disingenuous not including a major market event
t1_duimgcg	0	*	No one suggested that. But I do get taxed on my house.
t1_duidxi9	0	*	I was being glib you oblivious cartoon character.  
t1_dui7wwh	0	*	Imagine what our country could be without lobbying. I'm sure it does some good but it's hard to imagine the damage doesn't massively outweigh the good
t1_duiax2d	1	*	Unless you're trying to force it on a billionaire*
t1_dui9u9j	0	*	you dont agree with tax brackets?
t1_dui8pem	1	*	I don't pray, so I'll just wish you good luck! :)
t1_duij054	1	*	I know, right? It sort of sucks to know that good legislation will never see the light of day because the reps are afraid to stick their neck out. 
t1_duiazz2	1	*	Yeah youre definitely not making 150K in rural KY though. 
t1_duibpgf	0	*	[Yeah, dang gubmint messin' up my wealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation#Causes).
t1_duicxed	0	*	And yet you seem to be arguing against progressive taxation and that top earners should pay more.
t1_dui9tht	1	*	If you are going to invest anyway, it's almost always better to delay paying taxes.
t1_dui5dl1	1	*	A little knowledge is a dangerous thing. 
t1_duiah5i	1	*	yep. I totally agree. 100k salary and housing cost between 20k-30k a year. Not taking account taxes and any other bills. This is the real terrible problem happening in the DMV area.
t1_dui7kyo	1	*	The part where no one suggested he did in the first place, so wtf are you talking about?
t1_dui9lxz	1	*	Reading comp fail? A family of 4 means two parents and two kids. 
t1_duic8hc	0	*	... i cant tell if you are being serious right now.
t1_duidem9	0	*	Of course you should make more money than them.  but that number shouldn't be 100.000 times more than them. 
t1_dui8p5a	0	*	You pride yourself in those kinds of figures?   Pathetic. Aim higher. America has the capacity to be the greatest nation in the world. Fucking live up to it. 
t1_duj0o8i	0	*	Do you really want to try to advocate for flat tax? Is that where this is leading?
t1_dui8rou	0	*	I remember that plan.  Seemed like it could have been a nice solution 
t1_duigvuu	1	*	I guess U0001f937ufe0f are we all lizards and I forgot maybe? 
t1_duid8fz	0	*	20% of the public pays negative income taxes.  The middle 60% pay 10% of the taxes, the top 20% pay 90% of all Federal income taxes.
t1_dui9g7i	1	*	It's all about where you live. Waynesville, IL? 150k is ample to save. San Fran? Maybe not so much. 
t1_dui8cv5	1	*	To whom are you referring when you say, they? 
t1_duiet7p	1	*	It sounds like you're on a good path.   I think if you encourage your kids to get on a good path too, they'll be fine, but whatever you can do to improve the country will make it even better.
t1_duzhae2	0	*	Would you have considered the USSR a Communist state?   Edit: You do realize state socialism and communism are essentially the same thing right?   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communist_state
t1_duz7sjd	0	*	Yeah, they don't have a ton of defense companies to overcharge for their services.
t1_duzh5e3	0	*	Why is it so hard for people to think outside their local surroundings and see that things don't have to directly benefit them to help 
t1_duzb9oi	1	*	Half of the population in China is more than twice of the total population of US. Remember, China's GDP is still about half of America's
t1_duz9n7d	0	*	That was never in question. What is our research spending in proportion to our military spending? I'd look it up, but I don't care that much.
t1_duzepyb	1	*	Thats in part because the candidates in the center are often the most establishment and elitist of them all so people turn towards the extremes for some sense of sincerity.
t1_duza5go	0	*	realistically speaking, does America REALLY need 10 aircraft carriers 
t1_duz89cx	0	*	Education is free up or middle school. The poorest people live in extremely remote areas which is where infrastructure comes in. 
t1_duz8j2n	0	*	US schools are pretty shit in comparison to Chinese schools considering they keep getting shot up. Can't learn if you're dead.
t1_duzf1j8	0	*	This is only because we are the third most populous nation in the world. Per capita publications we are behind Ireland IIRC.
t1_duzgxqg	0	*	Heritage Foundation is biased against any and all regulation. So it's not a good choice.
t1_duzcztp	1	*	Yeah, but how many of those are financed by Big Pharma and should be burned.
t1_duzc3pv	1	*	Right. And it looks like any old airport. Ages ahead ... Please. 
t1_duzhtu5	1	*	thanks!
t1_duzb1ff	1	*	In 2016, around 40% live in rural, and living in rural areas doesn't necessarily mean they have no internet there... I mean the e-commerce market is getting pretty hot in rural areas lately.
t1_duzbuvy	0	*	I thought we were talking about infrastructure?
t1_duze5gs	0	*	Humans are more suggestible than we'd like to admit. Modern politics ultimately comes down to who can hire the most clever marketing team.
t1_duz4nku	0	*	Can't wait to vote Trump again.
t1_duzi4wc	0	*	You sure you dont want argue unnecessarily on reddit about a topic most of us are not properly equipped to discuss?
t1_duzc3n2	1	*	If you're in the demographic that's going to rent a car then you would benefit from the people who live in these cities switching to rail instead of congesting the highways
t1_dshv3gg	1	*	Hm I guess it must be there then. 
t1_dtfh1mn	1	*	I have a problem guaranteeing wealth for a few and penance for the many.  What are you, a communist?
t1_dtfw76p	1	*	/r/cringe
t1_dtfnf2e	1	*	Your analogy fails because it's a zero-sum game, trade (when GDP is growing) is not a zero-sum game.
t1_dtg4jl4	1	*	In what way is farming important? Can't we just import more food?
t1_dsk52ke	0	*	He's certainly launching an ad hominem attack, but a racist one? Probably not - there are certainly a lot of clueless, embittered expats in China, no?
t1_dsk4e3s	0	*	But you're just making empty assertions with no evidence, versus a hardcore environmental NGO and a reputable news outlet. You see why folks ought to brush you off?
t1_duea7wq	0	*	lmao whatever.  who are you again?
t1_dts4aau	1	*	But they are Trump supporters...  Or are you claiming the video is a lie? 
t1_du8hl6y	1	*	Raytheon themselves deny that as indicated in my sources.  You links don't support your claim in any way.  Have a nice day
t1_dtuhcjk	0	*	Nice!
t1_dtu7z2n	1	*	You've really never heard of the Small Business Administration?
t1_dtuo9zq	1	*	*Nice!*
t1_dtu8vm4	0	*	Do you have the title of that book still? 
t1_dtuc8mh	0	*	Yeah because trickle down economics, a reasonable temporary response to certain economic situations, is the same as ancient religious beliefs. 
t1_du3370z	1	*	http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2060412,00.html
t1_dtfle4l	1	*	I guess the key would be to add iron slowly, in such a way that it doesn't cause a bloom-blust.
t1_dtekkl5	0	*	The two countries are eerily similar.
t1_dtec7kn	0	*	Yes Im saying. The ones that want to die for that cause. They can. So we have less humans. 
t1_dtirh1o	0	*	I know that, I was referring to the C02 deposition cycle as a whole.
t1_dtej0jg	0	*	Is there such a thing as sustainable farming that can be performed on a large scale to sustain civilization? Or is all farming just diverting salt to land?
t1_dtengaf	0	*	There was a saying that went, Only when the last animal is hunted and the last tree is cut will Man realise he cannot eat money.  Thats starting to get more and more apt.
t1_dtel37g	0	*	Don't you need a hypothesis for an experiment? 
t1_dten8zo	0	*	>World celebrates after we die.    FTFY
t1_dtemjvw	0	*	But with a system as complex as Earth's climate, someone who studies it is many times *more qualified* to warn us of the consequences of our actions when it comes to the climatic response.
t1_dtem6e1	0	*	When the result is more or less known, the process is more accurately called a science demonstration than a science experiment. 
t1_dtejy63	0	*	Dont have children also is a good one. 
t1_dtekzv9	1	*	Yep. It's futuretech! or bust at this point.
t1_dtelea1	0	*	How long until environmental terrorism becomes environmental self defense?  Don't put me on a list pls lol
t1_dteo6pf	1	*	Nope, game over for humies only. World has millions of years left to play out. 
t1_dteisg1	0	*	those things are just not a reasonable ask globally. some other solution must be found.
t1_dtf221x	1	*	If it weren't for the fact there was 6 inches of topsoil and that it rained occasionally, there would be no civilization. 
t1_dteymo8	1	*	Also, eat kelp. Kelp farming can help re-oxidize oceans (not enough to repair the current damage, but enough to slow down the worsening situation).
t1_dtekp1w	1	*	> Agriculture not being as important as it is Wouldn't need these: GMOs, Pesticides, subsidies, etc.  The only ones who say we need these are those that sell them, and their hired cronies :-(

t1_dte9h2a	1	*	Cool, thanks.
t1_dtfdboh	0	*	Going by my country's voting record, your proposed system would have similar results to the current one, except for more seats for fringe extremists. 
t1_dtej725	0	*	Instead of all that can I like a facebook post or something?
t1_dteny0g	1	*	Switching to barely from wheat is a civilization advance as barley production is more efficient from various aspects of energy consumption rather than wheat. 
t1_dtfj2c7	1	*	Im not sure. I think people are just misinformed. But you never know..
t1_dtejzb6	1	*	Can't wait to listen to these, thanks for sharing
t1_dtew60d	0	*	But if I say the earth has had periods of poluttion from Volcanoes and asteroid strikes that dwarf what we are doing im sure you'll dismiss it and say its not important or relevant.
t1_dtel2a4	0	*	Shows the type of democracy we live in when voting is laughable (it is) and our only hope is that the aristocracy bothers to develop some miracle technology to save our lives. 
t1_dtelovt	0	*	Except one is demonstrably worse. 
t1_dtelwk1	1	*	Yeah. No president in the last 30 years has helped alleviate any of this. 
t1_dteq3bu	1	*	I see what youre saying, but extinction still seems worse to me 
t1_dtek9w6	1	*	Western civ maybe but there are other forms of civilization. Hearders for instance.
t1_dtet8s3	1	*	The Pentagon doesn't have trouble with funding. They get everything they want, and more.
t1_dter2b4	0	*	Penn and Teller made an episode years ago, saying that recycling is dumb because, except for aluminum, it's not worth it. It was a pure short-term money view of the issue, ugh.
t1_dtfdlb1	0	*	Interesting, that is not at all what I've read and studied, but my glaciology course was a few years ago so I may be behind on the times.  Do you have any sources that I could read on the topic?  
t1_dtel7ea	0	*	What's ironic is how much they're arguingagainst the polish death camp thing while the government is literally being trumpeted by fascist neo Nazis 
t1_dtf2atu	1	*	If it weren't for the fact there was 6 inches of topsoil and that it rained occasionally, there would be no civilization. 
t1_dte10qc	0	*	neither of them have a good argument, really
t1_dteu4rg	1	*	Where they tested on to death? Sounds horrible.
t1_dtv2oin	0	*	Nukes here are just to illustrate. The point is that you seem to be okay with whatever as long as they can murder enough people to get their way.

t1_dud9p9h	0	*	Lets put a catalytic converter up your ass
t1_ducyzim	0	*	Okay this is a really dumb thing to point out. Who would argue that? Vegetarians on average have lower hypertension, cholesterol, diabetes, and cancer rates.

t1_ductwc0	0	*	Oh. No, I like meat.
t1_dshfv9t	1	*	I think that argument has some merit. 
t1_dsj5p0h	0	*	Not in my experience. YMMV.
t1_dshsgha	1	*	I think you replied to the wrong post.
t1_dshm0p8	0	*	You're basing this all on how you feel. You feel something. You do not know anything. 
t1_dsimfht	1	*	Not for you. But now that your house it demolished, and your life in shambles, I would love to take your property off your hands. Of course I won't be paying much...
t1_dsh6vz1	0	*	Ah, I get it. I would have a more well developed political opinion if I started writing like an imbecile and adopting the infantile rhetoric of the alt-right, is that righty-right?
t1_dsi0lq4	1	*	For sure, there are going to be differing opinions everywhere you go. Often those opinions can change when it stops becoming words. 
t1_dshhml2	1	*	Urah?
t1_dsii1dm	1	*	We choose to go with Moon, nut because it is easy, but because it is hard.
t1_dsh8i16	1	*	Not unless they are causing a war.  You could have gone with ignoring climate change since that is recognized as a potential national security issue.
t1_dshpng7	0	*	He ordered the Second Intifada which resulted in the murders of hundreds of innocent people. It's disgusting how you can't see the hypocrisy in defending this.
t1_dsi0dzt	1	*	No doubt!
t1_dsi48mj	0	*	Oh he will get a second term. Watch.
t1_dshiwzc	1	*	Yes, they will use it to defend themselves, not as a first strike. This really isn't that hard to understand.

t1_dshcrd0	0	*	nobody wants to deal with your shit.

t1_dsh3kgh	1	*	I go there every two years to visit my friend who teaches there.    such a fucking weird place.  Coming from Canada.
t1_dshn4q8	0	*	I agree!  We elected Trump because you called us stupid!  *Trump proceeds to do something that proves his supporters dumb as hell almost every day*.  You couldnt make this shit up. 
t1_dshhb84	1	*	Oh yeah, and Japan invaded Korea! There's layers to this I tell you! Layers! /s
t1_dshhdsh	1	*	Oh yeah I'm really having my views challenged by a guy not adding any discussion and whining about downvotes.
t1_dsi0dos	1	*	For sure, I was in Seoul also and never saw any banners like that. Like said, I'm sure there are people on both sides of the fence everywhere you go. 
t1_dsi1ep1	1	*	If Trump can get the job done with words, why bother with sanctions?  Sanctions hurt innocent people, too.
t1_dsho7oa	0	*	I'm saying that he COULD do those things and people still wouldn't give him credit for it. I didn't think it was too complicated to be honest.
t1_dshlcsz	0	*	Ben Shapiro called, he wants his tired bit back.
t1_dsh5p96	1	*	Would prawn or shrimp be considered insects?
t1_dsfuz0p	1	*	... Good thing I didn't do that. Of course the fact that I didn't actually means that you bringing it up is entirely irrelevant. I have to wonder why you'd bother.
t1_dsfd8ph	0	*	Food at the grocery store is relatively cheap. The state shouldnt be responsible to feed every single child. For low income families, they should be provided food stamps or something similar
t1_dsflic1	0	*	So Muslim parents are being culturally pressured to spend more money to send their kids to school. Good one, France. Great way to ***NOT*** isolate your Muslim communities. \*Rolls eyes*
t1_dsfhnkh	1	*	The irony is lost on some people 
t1_dsgkhv7	1	*	Maybe. But you are fighting a uphill battle with that one. 
t1_dsix9cx	0	*	I'm calling you out on your bullshit. You're saying Spilled blood gives you French citizenship, when it's absolutely wrong. It gives you the right to do the paperwork. Nothing more.

t1_dtcrylj	0	*	But it is efficient for corporations to take advantage of tax incentives and cheap fuel.    
t1_dtcqykc	0	*	Thank you! I was feeling so guilty about not being vegan. I already avoid red meat in favor or chicken and tofu. 
t1_dtcone8	0	*	Local eggs and milk are still not ethical. Seriously. Look into it.
t1_dtcs6v6	1	*	There have always been vegan options. Grains, vegetables, and legumes is all you need. The fancy stuff is nice. Being able to order at a restaurant occasionally is nice. But none of it is necessary.
t1_dtcnxb4	0	*	Seriously man, Google is your friend here. Also maybe a few biology, evolution, and ecology courses.
t1_dtcr966	0	*	Of course! My partner eats meat. I'm happy to offer any kind of suggestions that will help. Even eating a single day a week (meatless monday) goes a long way for the planet.
t1_dtcrjqx	0	*	If you honestly don't care about other humans, then you are probably a terrible person and no one on reddit will convince you to care.

t1_dtcu4g8	0	*	I don't know if you've ever tried to put on significant muscle but you can certainly have too little protein.
t1_dtcv1j6	1	*	Source your palm oil from sustainable places though. Every year my country gets haze because Indonesia doesn't give a single fuck regarding clearing plantation fields without fire. 
t1_dtckb4d	0	*	grass, insects and plant seeds, they seem to come back every year? beef, venison, chicken, turkey, wild pig, duck, geese, pheasant etc.
t1_dtcp0im	0	*	Is Reuters a Scientific source? No? Thanks for trying.
t1_dtecqwh	1	*	Sorry, didn't mean to misrepresent you.
t1_dtcqafp	0	*	I mean, if you were the only person who had to live on this planet, that might be a reasonable strategy...
t1_dtcye9c	0	*	Might as well get your own farm field going at that point. 
t1_dtclw4x	0	*	xa1Soy capitan!

t1_dtcsxvz	0	*	> all just tastes like curry  I'd be more upset if it didn't.
t1_dtdo62j	1	*	> by itself and that is a fact not a belief.  You're preaching to the choir but you're going to get a lot of pushback on that which is why I simply said belief.
t1_dtcvnqi	1	*	Vancouver is the biggest export market for sushi grade fish outside of Tokyo.  We get sushi fish before anyone else does.  We love it THAT much.

t1_dtclvsm	0	*	My great uncle(who was a veterinarian for Christ's sake) used to give his springer spaniels bite sized snickers as treats.
t1_dtcqeek	1	*	Well I'm an american white guy and I can tell the difference, but that might just be because I eat a lot of it. 
t1_dtd5t8w	1	*	Ooh, you got me! I bet you feel smug.
t1_dtcs6uu	0	*	I think that will change over the next 10 years as the CICO argument fades away and the lipophilia hypothesis takes center stage in the mainstream dietary guidelines infrastructure.
t1_dtcq18n	0	*	IIRC They have one in Folsom, California  as well
t1_dtcgr2i	0	*	In that area more money is apparently better spent burning down forests than building greenhouses.
t1_dtct0bd	0	*	I was here for this. 
t1_dtcuj8i	0	*	I would just rather have a rain forrest on the planet, since apparently we'll have to pick one of the other pretty soon.  EDIT: this was a joke. Clearly we don't have to pick one or the other.
t1_dtcuv6j	0	*	Definitely ubiquitous in tbe US. That bottle is very distinct

t1_dtcmcfa	0	*	Not sure if you're being sarcastic...
t1_dtda470	1	*	I'd like to get those books, but I only use, and have utensils for, the metric system. Translating measurements in every recipe defeats my reasons for having the books.
t1_dtctihk	0	*	That's just a trait of Germany though, not because it's landlocked. I mean the area along the Rhine is extremely fertile isn't it?
t1_dtcu9z9	1	*	The millions of people in the world who produce a significant carbon footprint probably dont use reddit. So being authoritarian on reddit to redditors wont do shit. 
t1_dtcn620	0	*	well... are they problems that would hit them early enough in life to matter? I mean most long term problems aren't quite that big of a factor when you've already got a kill by date.
t1_dtdy6n3	1	*	Thanks
t1_dtd5rmd	0	*	Good thing I didn't suggest humans should eat the same as cows, but thanks for trying to have a point.
t1_dtcwqtq	0	*	You just perfectly defined deciding the only thing that's keeping you from deciding is you don't have the power to. God forbid you ever do get in power.
t1_dtct88r	0	*	I never said anything of that sort.
t1_dtcl3xs	0	*	Animal agriculture is sociopolitical is it not? Animal agriculture has lead to the destruction of 70-90% of the rainforest, you can find those statistics on many different sources. 
t1_dtcsrez	0	*	Thank you!
t1_dtcsd4t	1	*	Excellent post. Permaculture is the path to the renewing our planet.
t1_dtdbcgo	1	*	Oh is that right? Bah humbug.   In any case, the key is to regulate corporations. The average consumer is easily overwhelmed with all these choices, and they just want to get in/out of the store.
t1_dtcx2hx	0	*	Fuck. You're way dumber that I thought. Keep surprising me.
t1_dtcvany	1	*	it worked though. i already feel better
t1_dtd1fi6	0	*	The liver from the last half cow I bought was about 10-12 lbs, kidneys were about 8 lbs. The meat yield was 750 lbs. We use every part of the animal(tallow, bones, all internal organs, etc).
t1_dtckkz5	0	*	Chickens really do have much lower impact, especially if they are free range.
t1_dtct5l6	0	*	Oh yeah the rest of us 7 billion humans couldn't give a fuck. Only you care. None of us have loved ones on this planet! We wake up every morning fuck this gay earth!

t1_dtdh3up	1	*	The work at the center of the forest already happens and is effective.
t1_dtd5k69	1	*	We dont need to eat meat. Youre choosing to because of taste, so the fetus question is not a straw man at all. 
t1_dtcqx1n	1	*	According to that article, it's mostly because of very progressive inventive greenhouse farming. You can literally do that on the rooftops of buildings (I've seen it done).

t1_dszaz28	1	*	It was a rhetorical question.
t1_dt35hlv	1	*	I don't think US allies would ever abandon them, that wouldn't be good for anyone. Unless the next president you elect is worse than Trump and actively starts cutting ties.
t1_dt1vxe4	1	*	This thing is part of second strike from Russia I think.
t1_dt0twqw	0	*	Aight bud you win youre clearly smarter than the entire Russian government and military and I for that matter. This is obviously sci-fi and would NEVER exist in real life

t1_dt0uh1j	0	*	> it won't work.  Can you explain?  EMP is a known, *experienced* phenomena.  Why do you think it won't work?
t1_dt17lhi	0	*	Pakistan has its warheads and delivery systems stored separately, so that potential insurgents can't steal them, which also reduces their value in any massive military attack.
t1_dt1h9if	0	*	They don't need ports. Just Chinese and Russian vessels to support them.

t1_dsmdjhd	1	*	But then where is the flood of well off Norwegian immigrants?
t1_dskwla6	0	*	It's a baseless rumor because President Obama was born in Hawaii, but the whole reason that rumor was started was because he's black.

t1_dsm1d7h	0	*	Culture in many ways does influence society, yes. But what about hatian culture is responsible for corruption? Why is hatian culture somehow not worth having in the US? Is it because they're poor? 
t1_dslt42j	0	*	You're an immigrant that want to see fire and blood and defend the country from other immigrants. Because you don't like immigrants.  You're a living contradiction...

t1_duq5591	1	*	What country am I president of again?
t1_duq559z	1	*	Haha, I mean he's got a really solid track record, so I trust him. Investors seem to trust him too because the value of the currency rose to its highest levels in years. 
t1_dsqw2j0	0	*	No, it's that you're trying too hard.

t1_dtshphs	1	*	Youre putting way too much confidence in middle management. Im just impressed they can turn their computers on
t1_dts8bqp	1	*	> A change will be needed eventually if our species continues to spread.  Nonsense. Humans are quite capable at using either UTC and their local time. 
t1_dtrns18	0	*	The vast majority of people don't travel far very often. Why change a system to cater for 0.0001% of people?

t1_ds89phf	0	*	They had a year to be informed.
t1_ds6ym0s	1	*	ok but under UK laws, waging war under false pretenses is not a war crime.
t1_ds6ruw4	0	*	War crime is a pretty well defined term under [International humanitarian law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_humanitarian_law)
t1_ds6y7so	1	*	True, I was just emphasising that it wasn't literally half of the population :)
t1_ds6hmxh	1	*	How is an opinion ever a fact. If anything the most factual part of this is it's a fact Tony Blair said it.
t1_ds6hwow	0	*	It does if the decision is about dismantling democracy and destroying democratic institutions. 
t1_ducq3p7	1	*	You say that as if it's a bad thing. Look at Russia, conquest is totally feasible in the modern era.
t1_duda3mg	0	*	> How much of the population do u think actually likes this path?   Apparently 50%

t1_ds8j74z	0	*	What about them? If a country has private property, it can't be socialist.
t1_ds7vwsb	1	*	Except that materialism actually has evidence behind it, and religion does not?
t1_ds7r02i	1	*	That went off the rails quickly 
t1_ds7u1en	0	*	Ah the philosophy troll.  Quite rare, that.
t1_dsffwt2	1	*	Chine is implementing explicitly capitalist free market reforms. Their legitimacy is now derived from increasing living standards and not socialism. 
t1_ds868oy	1	*	>this anti-communist circlejerk  If you think anti-communism is a circlejerk please step away from the computer and read a book. 
t1_ds7q5yb	0	*	Then the point stands, no? Europe is capitalist with a welfare state, not socialist. 
t1_ds85luz	1	*	Mixed economy doesnt mean socialist plus capitalist. 
t1_ds8um6j	1	*	Yes, but to illustrate the scale of the issue and how it is inappropriate to say America has problems as deep as Venezuela...
t1_ds7whiz	1	*	I was just trying to clarify because in the US and even in Europe sometimes people will refer to social democrats as socialists. Like the French Socialist Party who are actually social democrats.
t1_dsa4ij9	0	*	Yeah, a dictatorship of the proletariat.
t1_ds8hfth	0	*	The NHS is also on the verge of collapsing
t1_ds69cl8	0	*	Either is fine, so long as the videos aren't too blurry, or the articles from known sources.
t1_ds6f5ek	1	*	Why comment on a topic when you are not aware of ground realities? These two people are central to the ground reality in the Israel-Palestine conflict right now.
t1_duyzqrs	1	*	No, that's called oligarchy. It's not much better, but it's no fascism.
t1_dsbyhuw	0	*	It goes from a piece of land that palestinians can live on to an area that only israelis live on. See the difference? subtract from palestine and add to israel.
t1_dsbu9fj	0	*	Jew owned land is israel land, hence the settlements.   >most countries don't even have the death penalty.  Are we just making up shit now?
t1_du1j8yh	0	*	So you are now admitting that the deal went through and they did in fact pay $100k for materials on Trump? 
t1_dsyta2s	1	*	Netherlands worse than the US?.......i dont even know what to say to that statement because i never heard such a bullshit comment in a very very long time.
t1_dsz26n1	0	*	The trick to being a proper racist is to control and gentrify the language so that you can derail the conversation instead of looking inwards.
t1_dsrugkv	0	*	>Her family has been stupidly wealthy for a long time  When youre wealthy because your ancestors were kings I tend to find any argument that the money is yours and not the countrys a bit weird.
t1_dsrpix8	0	*	Sure, but poor pensioners may not look favorably on the *argument* op put forward. 
t1_dsrfpex	0	*	Precisely. Most major retail chains aren't supermarkets.  And I'll just point or the number of votes on the top comment.   A lot of people were wondering. 
t1_dtqrlen	0	*	I dunno about that, if using a public bathroom i practically have to use gloves to touch anything. Pissing as a man at home or outside you dont have any contact with piss in any way
t1_dso52ti	1	*	What does that even mean lmao  Stop Appeasing the belligerents? By cutting diplomatic ties and aid? Is that really what you think diplomacy is about? Slash & burn tactics? 
t1_dso5iu1	1	*	Putin's the biggest troll on the planet. 
t1_dsof0cy	1	*	If he stopped trying to appease the belligerents he would have no base left
t1_dsdo2g9	0	*	The corporations who outsource the factories to Mexico to pay salaries on pesos, but keep selling the consumer goods on US territory on dollars, must be making huge amounts of money.

t1_duowbnc	1	*	Hes ruined lengthy posts for everyone. But its pretty funny when it happens.
t1_dup4s2h	0	*	The first article says the paramilitary were for resisting Soviet invasion. The other claims about Gladio were [KGB forgeries](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/U.S._Army_Field_Manual_30-31B).   
t1_dup29zm	1	*	Thats very odd. Without reading the article, I would theorize wildly that the ambassador and the cocaine traffickers had different Russian patrons who are jockeying for power.
t1_dup6827	0	*	Roll persuasion with disadvantage

t1_duq37pr	1	*	Also, screw you for being an internet dick and needlessly anti-American.
t1_dup3orf	0	*	Be more considered with your generalizations. Leftists had their share of war. Woodrow Wilson and JFK didn't exactly avoid WW1 and Vietnam.

t1_dsv05jv	1	*	but the referee waves play on!
t1_dstzdam	1	*	My main goal was to point out that this is not a Japanese thing.
t1_duz6pfc	1	*	They all have someone responsible for defense... Fucking duh... Someone... You know... With a fucking army.
t1_dv06sw7	1	*	Cool.
t1_dtoqets	1	*	Wildcat pilots wouldn't disagree. Once the tactics were worked out the Zero was done. Even against wildcats.
t1_dtp3rdc	1	*	You should realize that there are a lot of people in the world that are worse than Nazis. They simply dont have the capability to impose themselves on the rest of the world. 
t1_dtp03x4	0	*	> Japanese war records show that they didn't lose any planes during the battle.   I mean, how sure are we that THOSE are accurate either?
t1_dtp1zvs	0	*	No, we supply them to Saudi Arabia.  They then sell them to the extremists.
t1_dtoziip	1	*	True, but it is still a very different aircraft. The Su-25 can perform SEAD duties, and fly faster than the A-10. Its more of a solo ground-pounder than a compliment to ground forces.
t1_dtoz8ny	1	*	lol

t1_dtp0z5l	0	*	Seems unrealistic as we saw today.

t1_dtoz6ge	0	*	Soviet POWs were in the same camps with Jews
t1_dtoqkm0	1	*	Never would've guessed 
t1_dtozbct	1	*	There are still rules and they most likely bombed just cause a small building was making radios.
t1_dtr6qna	1	*	Yeah, but we never shot a parachuting Japanese pilot.  Because they didn't issue them.
t1_dtoqaad	0	*	Yes, but the A10 is far more capable 
t1_dtp1dj8	0	*	>A6M  >Jets  Um, the Zero might have eight different flavors, but none of them are equipped with jet engines.
t1_dtoqnpk	0	*	we really gonna start defending Assad and Russia?   What the fuck is wrong with the world?
t1_dtoo4wz	1	*	Also a war crime.
t1_dtp20um	1	*	Also civilian aircraft.
t1_dtp37x7	1	*	That's all well and good. But our news sources focusing more on profit and entertainment and clicks isn't anywhere comparable to state controlled Russian news.
t1_dtopbwj	1	*	Thats cause you dont have one
t1_dtospnn	0	*	You mean the Russian aircraft that pull Gs so hard they incapacitate pilots?
t1_dtosr3v	1	*	Something I like to call 'Reddit user continuity error magic' and they are eating lunch and midnight cause the are evil Nazis, that's what evil guys do - go against the rules.

t1_dtp822r	1	*	Oh, interesting. Thanks
t1_dtp1l6s	1	*	>bomb the fuck out of us  It's almost as if that was the point of having fighter jets flying there.
t1_dtp4lv2	1	*	Well maybe they shouldn't get shot down and have to bail. 
t1_dtp35l3	1	*	What's the difference between that and ordering a pilot half a world away to do the same thing?
t1_dtom47k	0	*	The Geneva conventions weren't created until after the end of WW2 in 1949. Hitler didn't have to concern himself with whether he was breaking them or not because they did not exist at the time.

t1_dtp15h8	0	*	You obviously don't understand that exactly what is happening in Syria and Yemen right know.  
t1_dtojglg	0	*	Has it ever not worked like that in modern history? Sounds damn near impossible to get great powers to agree not to meddle and alleviate conflicts.
t1_dtol4iz	0	*	Yes that's true, I did not disagree.
t1_dtpjqhl	1	*	I am sure pilot knew that place he landed will not know about Geneva convention rules.  In my opinion it is a point less way to die, but hey, he is a grown up person who chooses what to do. 
t1_dtp9yet	0	*	What fucking reason do you think they ban alcohol on Sunday in the South? Health?
t1_dtpj3yk	1	*	Razor sharp edge there, man. 
t1_dtp3nih	1	*	They usually don't hit anything but explode right next to it.
t1_dtou6sc	0	*	Yes, that's a Chinese aircraft.
t1_dtoz14m	0	*	Feel free to setup your own country and try and argue with the entire international consensus then.
t1_dtomea9	0	*	You are right for pistol but both qualify as small arms fire.  Also Its easier for Jihadists to get AK than pistols so.   edit: someone is downvoting me with passion wonder why?
t1_dtp91rd	1	*	In campaign there's absolutely planes and jets. I'm not talking about multiplayer.
t1_dtp08uj	1	*	It has plenty. None you can fly though. But I could see it happening in the campaign. 
t1_dtpgpke	0	*	If they can't pin it on rebels and there is *unequivocal* proof they did it? Not a whole lot, still.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran_Air_Flight_655

t1_dtoo67n	0	*	I hadn't thought of that, but you're right. Clearly we should start sticking these on pilots, just in case they get their chance.
t1_dtp7hdi	1	*	Yikes alright scooby doo
t1_dtot0in	1	*	Fun fact, the SU-25 looks a LOT like the [Northrop YA-9](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northrop_YA-9), the aircraft that lost the contract competition to the A-10.
t1_dtprjuq	1	*	Anything in Syrian air space is fair game - Russia was invited to be there, Turkey is there illegally. 
t1_dtpc3t6	0	*	>(starting it)  Want to show me how the Allies began bombing civilians first?   Id be keen to see any evidence of them starting it. 
t1_dtp346i	1	*	Huh.  Never thought of it like that
t1_dtp5dmb	1	*	Fuck space cancer!
t1_dtpgthx	0	*	What makes you say that? Both are considered to be correct.
t1_dtoofva	0	*	Sure, they were comparable. Stalin's brutality towards his own people is probably even unique to the soviets.  Thread is just mostly aimed at the Wehrmacht.\^\^
t1_dtozyoi	1	*	You'd imagine he would've used gas on the eastern front then (which is where the majority of fighting even occurred considering there was very little ground fighting in the west until mid 1944)
t1_dtpmr6d	1	*	It also didn't work well for Napoleon in Spain. 
t1_dtp3ejz	1	*	Could very well be. For example [Heinrich Bxe4r](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_B%C3%A4r) , a German Ace, crash-landed or bailed 18 times during the war.
t1_dtp9x5y	1	*	He was obviously referring to how the person he was replying to said So much for moderates after mentioning something about banning smoking and alcohol. 
t1_dtp1fiv	0	*	Seems like the case here.

t1_dtpuv16	0	*	In 1988? The US argued that it was a case of misidentification and i don't know why they'd shoot down a passenger jet otherwise, it's not a war crime.
t1_dtp1c39	1	*	It is slightly possible that the aircraft crashed after being shot with a missile. That is just my non expert opinion tho
t1_dtora6u	0	*	Fuck that I can just play battlefield and recreate it there. No need for stupid ass wars.
t1_dtp1se4	0	*	You don't understand total war than if you think that.

t1_dsehhqe	0	*	Thats unfortunately very misguided, but I will say no more.
t1_dseudq8	0	*	You can go to mexico its perfectly safe & gaza is only bad cuz of the gustapo isreali army that occupies it.

t1_dsdsnha	0	*	Well, if you have rampant inflation and price controls, sure, but the existing system is unlikely to collapse as it is currently structured, and crypto is unlikely to change that.
t1_dse4oh7	1	*	That sounds idiotic.

t1_dsdgfbe	0	*	How does this work? How do you control 8 characters simultaneous?
t1_dsej2dq	0	*	Your probably right on the technical thing.  But I don't understand why people think money is the only incentive to run a node. I disagree with that.

t1_dseqc0a	1	*	Wow.  That's really another good thing about XRB.

t1_dsdgh4x	0	*	A spoon of coffee is miniscule compared to the amount of water in a cup, but it's just a cup of hot water without it.
t1_dsdfjs0	0	*	I'm sorry for the redundancy that so offended you.  But I'm not changing it.  I could have put a therefore in there, but I'm on my phone and I don't really care enough.
t1_dsdrnjz	1	*	They're instant by design. You don't have to wait for miners to pick up your transaction. It's limited only by how fast nodes can update their ledgers. 
t1_dse946j	1	*	I propose a new, less cumbersome term, the contraction: n'instant .  Example: Oh, and it has no fees + transaction are n'instant.
t1_dsfubj7	0	*	If you are paying for your own electricity it is, even with an S9.  
t1_dsdi9w2	1	*	Definitely--I'm just pointing out that the reason gold is used in some applications is because it's non-reactive.

t1_dtmdmt4	0	*	What your cats do doesnt matter unless you claim that all cats are like your cats which they are not.
t1_dtmkyql	0	*	Because they want to protect jobs which could be done more efficiently else where. Protectionism doesn't work. It just leaves everyone with a worse product at a higher price.

t1_dtmzq61	1	*	umm they arent attackin Ukraine. 
t1_dtmowx2	1	*	Then no, probably.
t1_dtmmaem	1	*	Just because someone talks tough in public doesnt mean shit when the trade talks start.  Money overrides sentiment 100% of the time.
t1_dtmksnu	1	*	Or a politician saying random stuff, like the person he is addressing 
t1_dtmnuyr	0	*	Boom.
t1_dtmiby8	0	*	You're trying to make it out to be like the Democrats are fantastic, they've done some pretty messed up shit too. They don't get nearly as much attention.
t1_dtn58nk	0	*	And they can just ship straight from China and avoid the whole problem. Or we can just force Europe to switch to Samsung. Great deal right? Lol

t1_dtmin7i	1	*	Damn, you just murdered that guy.
t1_dtn5im5	0	*	Just seems out of place considering the false correction being made. 
t1_dtmi8rz	1	*	This is where I get all my afterlife smut! Nana has needs.
t1_dtmli7r	0	*	And all of these relatively major parties constitutes less than 20% of the electorate in most of these countries. They are minorities in the grand scale.
t1_dtmof45	0	*	France has power. An individual junior minister, not so much. France will never back this, so it's a non-starter.
t1_dtmj8sf	0	*	Those kindsa people tend to die young of heart issues
t1_dtmq0lw	0	*	So? The US is going down an isolationist path now. Facts are facts.
t1_dtmn6hm	1	*	Just stop. 
t1_dtmh90p	1	*	They certainly are too big of cowards to admit they are attacking Ukraine. Why would they be scared to admit it? Oh that's right, because Putin is scared of Europe.
t1_dtmmu7c	0	*	france is one of the top two nations in terms of influence in the EU. even if they're not directly in charge of trade decisions, they still have a lot of pull.
t1_dtmjkv9	1	*	But trump is clearly no stranger to that...
t1_dtmj0ue	0	*	Examples of 3rd world countries doing better? Sounds like you know jack-shit about the US. 
t1_dtn3y9n	0	*	So you just took it as an opportunity to be a self righteous jackass? Cool. 
t1_dtnqfo3	0	*	Strawmanning your way out of a tough spot?  Direct lines of logic are obviously not your thing. 
t1_dtmlee5	0	*	...which isn't even that important in this matter because it is the EU that negotiates trade deals in Europe.
t1_dtmy053	0	*	Thanks for admitting defeat. Have a nice day.  Oh... you won't though.  https://imgur.com/a/JbCxw#1dJpNzM
t1_dtmmoor	1	*	yeah, france is pretty much second only to germany in influence in the EU.  the UK used to have a lot of influence too, but we fucked that up.

t1_dtmgo5a	1	*	He started it!
t1_dtq4wbt	1	*	the power game is already being played by China, it is the belief system of the PRC

t1_dsqh2fo	1	*	Right, he suggested they are different, i was pointing out that he did not suggest they are the same.  You did too, but with a quote.  Thank you for the support.
t1_dspivwe	1	*	When you argue, its not for the sake of the other person, but for those that witness the argument and the results that are brought.
t1_dspk0ap	0	*	Why, because freedom of expression shouldn't apply to stupid people?
t1_ds25yty	1	*	The majority of the world?   Don't conflate the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts. A lot of countries supported and participated in the invasion of Afghanistan.  Iraq was the far more controversial one.
t1_ds1hhdn	1	*	Great victim blaming.
t1_ds1sftn	0	*	We didnt invade Iran in 1953 either. What exactly are you talking about? 
t1_dsk97to	0	*	Yeah, Hollywood has way more impact on people than the Renaissance. People in Thailand don't see ads for the Renaissance on TV everyday.
t1_dsll1i6	1	*	Not poor doesn't mean rich. It can just mean the same.
t1_dy99rt2	1	*	Nah, my parents expected that I fill out a Visa correctly.
t1_dv32ydb	0	*	Huh. Didn't realize not knowing shit about sports ball made you a Russian. Will facts about the Overwatch League do?
t1_dteh29y	0	*	Face it, you're using an isolated massacre in the 1990's to deny the genocide of millions of Armenians by the Turks, in just a few years.  
t1_dtfh46k	0	*	We have signage in multiple languages here in Turkey.   Does the Israeli Parliament speak Hebrew or Arabic? 
t1_dteak4g	0	*	No, Israel did not recognize it, they aren't officially seeking independence.

t1_dte9pqr	0	*	show me what document you researched. its obviously bullshit
t1_dtgsa03	0	*	We pretty much are Nato, and having Europe alligned with us is good for business. Alligned with Russia would harm us
t1_dtfb7so	1	*	Good point, but I am inclined to believe that powerful governments support genocide, including the US government (and I'm an American)
t1_dsrvdx9	0	*	If any one that's not immediate shits on Russia is considered a troll a bot or some other none sense. The Russians, if they did spread insidious subversive propaganda, have already won.

t1_ds7yi14	0	*	Whatever you say champ. Being India's little brother sure does make Pakistani nationalists an odd bunch. 
t1_ducfnfj	1	*	Automation and universal basic income is an inevitability anyway, just a question of how long it will take for the political will to materialize. In the US, I'd guess a really long time.

t1_dut51yv	1	*	Did we enter another Great Depression while I wasn't looking?    Cause you're aware that's why the US needed massive public works projects in the 30s right?
t1_dusnoyw	1	*	 2 amendment being the pillar of the US is just your opinion and gun control is not the same as overturning the second amendment. This is just you freaking out and losing the argument.

t1_dta8rqg	1	*	From what I understand there was a large solar event in the 1800s and it could be seen as far south as the carribean.  Must have been beautiful.  Thats in my list of things to see.
t1_dt9t1x6	1	*	Who knew that the depopulation of our lands had some benefits?
t1_dtakl4o	1	*	>Vaguely Wicker-Man  That makes me think i would rather give it a miss lol
t1_dta5tna	0	*	Seriously? You've got all that farmland just an hour or two north of GTA.  Maybe more moisture in the air thanks to the lakes so the city glow reflects brighter and farther?
t1_dt9rwpp	0	*	disrespect
t1_dt9rpzb	0	*	Everything. Everything is flat.
t1_dtafz9x	1	*	Electoral college doesn't usually fail us like this. But hell, maybe seeing this kinda BS will get more people to back revamping the election system.
t1_dtaaatv	1	*	Try and coincide it with a new moon if possible as well. A bright moon can make a big difference in visibility. Blue areas will definitely be ok though.
t1_dtajxmu	0	*	You smell burning toast?
t1_du9v72w	0	*	plant-based means u only have a vegan diet but you still buy animal products like leather. Veganism is a lifestyle and a plant-based diet is just a diet. I am a vegan dumbass lol
t1_dt5rx2r	0	*	Let's redo this test in a group where everyone has the same skills until the women have good scores.  Each test is equal but the redoing is not.
t1_ds29kia	1	*	no I was correcting you
t1_ds2tk4p	0	*	Exactly. Perfect examples. You can't do that shit to an armed soldier guarding a border. 
t1_du23u0m	1	*	I was saying where she *doesn't* identify as a woman. Either way I'd go with the from birth sex. 
t1_du6bd00	1	*	Poe's law. That'd increase his numbers of upvotes anyway...
t1_du6bazh	1	*	You sound like a PR council when you write like that. Why write like that here, it's just Reddit
t1_du5xdkb	0	*	Its like German Amtsprache with a dash of Orwell mixed with *almost* natural sounding English that ends up meaning nothing but deny and deflect.
t1_dsfcwcw	0	*	> very helpful TO MAKE SURE I READ IT !!!  And yet you still refuse to answer. It's almost as if you are scared of what the answer means.
t1_duwwbmm	0	*	How did those whites acquire the lands?
t1_duwsq2m	1	*	RIP Captain Keyes.
t1_duzctra	1	*	Thanks man I'd appreciate it.
t1_duwu5jz	0	*	It wasn't illegal, they had a system of oppression called apartheid. I feel like you're missing some tools in your toolbox for this conversation. 
t1_du99861	0	*	I'd also be fine with being able to afford rent, tbh.
t1_du9x4ud	1	*	Interesting. Ive not heard that before, not being from the states myself.
t1_du9nq6m	1	*	Piss off the entire world AND kill family members?  NK isn't stupid.
t1_du90s2h	0	*	The Canadian govt can't violate the charter though, that's where this becomes tricky. The charter also protects the rights of  non citizens, in 1985 the supreme court already ruled this.  
t1_du93aqc	0	*	I don't know how it would work, and we may never see a unified Korea. An end to the war and atrocities in NK is as far as we should bother focusing for now.
t1_du8sk1o	1	*	You are just mad that we stole Elon Musk
t1_du900cr	1	*	And San Francisco. They print our MLS in newspaper form in several Chinese markets.
t1_du90tu0	0	*	Maybe blame the people who are willing to sell out to them? Or you only want to blame the foreigners in this case? 
t1_du8v8mf	0	*	1. Proof? 2. Shell people - you got plenty of poor people in Vancouver that can be used for shell purposes.
t1_du984ny	1	*	Yes but you only cash in if you downsize or move out of town. If you want to maintain your lifestyle, then good luck with that. 
t1_du9n4wt	1	*	Can you give me a link that says otherwise?
t1_du8vek3	1	*	I just looked at the weather and quality of life & asked people => immediate write off. Who the hell would ever want to live in Vancouver? Vampires? Rain lovers? WHO?
t1_du8robs	0	*	> The Canadian govt is responsible to the Canadian citizens, not some fucking Saudis or Chinese. Wh  You know Canadians inflate the real estate market in many locations throughout Latin America?
t1_du8ytgg	1	*	And NYC (but Russians too)
t1_du8opq0	1	*	What much of the problem ?
t1_du8aohm	1	*	That probably makes *you* the annoying relative that everyone at the dinner table wishes he would just choke 
t1_du8o7f9	0	*	Because they are leftist, obviously....  even if they advocated against social justice and for labor camps etc.... if they disagree with me and are leftists, they are SJWs.
t1_du8v75y	1	*	Nah, that is just a joke by the government. They can always just rent short term if they prove its empty. IF...
t1_du8xkgq	1	*	Why stop at foreign ownership restrictions? Domestic housing businesses have just as much incentive to shoot prices up and fabricate scarcity. 
t1_du9rgu9	1	*	They know what Sun-Tzu said, which is that you should always leave a path of retreat open to your enemies because if they don't have any, they will fight to the death and it will be costly.
t1_du8mw2k	0	*	What are squatting laws like if the house is otherwise uninhabited? What is stopping anyone from moving in?
t1_du8n7i1	1	*	https://youtu.be/zBkBiv5ZD7s 
t1_du90ll0	0	*	Nonetheless, that's the price you can buy them for. 
t1_du983qo	1	*	And Auckland
t1_dtut79e	0	*	People should have the right to publicly verbally harass others, and to commit acts of defamation and libel as well I take it? 
t1_dtu3g8g	0	*	Except the ones who sold out their neighbors and did nothing while they were being slaughtered...
t1_dtumyc7	1	*	Don't mean to say No to that question?
t1_dtufpma	0	*	That is not at all what this law is about
t1_dtukk1u	0	*	That is a long held belief about the opposition party in any country since the dawn of politics.
t1_dtv2vmy	1	*	That is pure fucking bullshit. Removing those statues is not an attack on free speech.
t1_dtudmhz	1	*	I get what he means, but it makes no sense.
t1_dtu566d	0	*	How do you then distinguish between the camps in Poland and other countries?  Sure, they're all Nazi ... but which ones? Ah, the Belarus ones! Or the ... POLISH ones.
t1_dttywro	0	*	> implies   So we ban it? 
t1_dtucxuo	0	*	> To call these Polish death camps is and insult to every Pole and to Poland.  Even to the Polish collaborators who turned in jews and their enemies to be executed?
t1_dttywhg	0	*	> implies linguistically ...  or that they were based in Poland. The whole measure is pure nationalism, no more, no less.
t1_dtxzsyz	0	*	Well yeah because they already do that. When they visit Auschwitz for example.  But yeah sure you can come and wave your flag, whatever makes you sleep at night pal.
t1_dtw7bf3	0	*	Again, this presumes that the Polish person didnt want the Jewish family gone. 
t1_dtvd3j0	1	*	I just read the article, and yeah, that seems like a terribly subjective law used to stifle speech the minister doesn't like.  
t1_dtufpqt	0	*	Statues put up in the 60's to protest civil rights for blacks. I can see why towns might not want that to be their history.
t1_dtvnyxm	0	*	Yeah, but you cant even point out that polish individuals were involved due to the new laws enforcing historical revisionism.  Source on 0.1%? Didnt even know those numbers were available.
t1_dtvf5yi	1	*	try taking tea away from Brits, them fuckers will colonize your ass. 
t1_dtuaoen	1	*	It was for me, but only for about 3 or 4 days. I understand Nic withdrawal goes a lot longer.
t1_dtva67d	1	*	Probably explosive vaporea.
t1_dtucgvn	0	*	Ah, the ever popular you people argument and persecution complex. Since you've already made up my arguments for me, I see no need to continue.
t1_dtub7ad	0	*	Except literally everyone smokes cigarettes wherever they want outside??? lmao fuck are you on about. I am outside, fuck off. You are fine.
t1_dtuhgrt	0	*	Alas, i cant have caffeine 99% of the time and baklava is too dangerous to keep around (itll be eaten instantly)
t1_dtvbl8l	1	*	The act of smoking is the strongest addiction, not nicotine.  
t1_dtv87b2	0	*	Speak for yourself dude. If I don't get any nicotine for a day, I hardly notice unless I'm already stressed.   Caffeine and antidepressants on the other hand... 
t1_dtv59jw	0	*	As a joke yes. IRL, no. Soda addicts have health issues waaaaaay more than coffe addicts.
t1_dtuk1io	1	*	I am a systems administrator and I have bad router experiences on the daily.
t1_dtuvxnr	1	*	Yep everyone means everything they say literally and nobody speaks colloquially on the internet. You aren't being pedantic at all
t1_dtubqbp	1	*	Sounds like me 10 years ago. 
t1_dtuy1ci	1	*	My mom quit caffeine but she still drink decaffeinated.
t1_dtvhrqf	0	*	And you're one pedantic motherfucker if that's what you want to harp on.  Enjoy the bitterness dude it seems like you're real mad about this
t1_dtveqfe	0	*	Its been an endless cycle of getting off the ciggs for a month then smoking joints heavily for a few days till i run out of weed, then i smoke the rest of my ciggerettes and the cycle begins again 
t1_dtun7ao	0	*	Yeah, don't do it. It's not worth it, plus after a month a cigarette will be super nasty. You're doing good, keep it up and start reducing nicotine or you'll be saddled with that stupid vape forever.
t1_dtv9us8	1	*	That's the goal.
t1_dtu99jy	0	*	Fine i guess I misread, you aren't proposing a ban.   You are however sidestepping my main point - so do you think coffee is health issue also? 
t1_dtuxkrd	0	*	Do you mean the short term or long term harm?
t1_dtusso5	1	*	Emissions require regulation. So does smoking. You're free to enjoy your hobby - at home, or in the designated smoking area.  You do realize that this is why vape users have such a bad rap.
t1_dtuhzkb	1	*	Yeah but when did a little table sawing ever hurt anyone?
t1_dsrb3bt	0	*	So pretty much the way it's been my entire life.  I wonder, do they still teach duck and cover?  It was claimed to be handy against tornadoes as well.
t1_dtfjp7v	0	*	Well that's the problem with not requiring voters to show some ID. We need voter ID now, woudn't you agree?
t1_dteph3e	0	*	You're rationalizing misinformation  https://i.redd.it/hvc1d4td46oz.gif
t1_dtfbrc4	1	*	Do you believe Foreign Governments should be allowed to spread propaganda in other counties elections? 
t1_dtey7pj	0	*	Wut?
t1_dua258z	1	*	Slartibartfast would. 
t1_du91w2c	1	*	Oh...  Well now I miss those times where I had forgotten this.
t1_du9bg62	0	*	Except that wasn't your point here, and cryptocurrency has a purpose, ill concede it hasn't been implemented properly yet but to say it has no purpose is dishonest
t1_du8zq67	0	*	Ah good ol' KiA. *The* place to go when you want stage 4 cancer. Or the origin of shitty r/Rick and Morty quality pastas.
t1_dua08iu	0	*	Fraid you've walked into this blind mate. With a lot of other cryptos you'd be right, but not Monero. head on over to /r/monero to find out more
t1_du97uz5	0	*	Is there a limited amount of transactions per block? 
t1_du9iqe2	1	*	Because the whole point of it is that many people that aren't serious miners can still mine Monero. And many many people just dabbling start with monero and their cpu
t1_du9y0qc	0	*	Won't this always be occurring though? cryptocurrency getting outdated and thus not 'good' (for whatever counts as good) compared to a new one.
t1_du96x38	0	*	Nice argument joe
t1_duajypd	0	*	Your ability to cash out is proportional to people who are willing to buy at-rate.    It's prime and waiting for a black Tuesday to strike.

t1_du9nw5x	1	*	Piracy, its a crime.
t1_dub8k7s	0	*	Humanity is not better off without a functioning environment. And no, because at least I can buy things with the currency with which the banking industry operates, bitcoin is fucking useless to me.
t1_du97rm2	0	*	A quick newsflash for you. Your gpu is not the only thing drawing power and is not the only hardware being used up. IF you are making anything, it's pennies. So enjoy that. 
t1_du9ges1	0	*	America?
t1_du98gb5	1	*	You didn't answer the question at all.
t1_dsadlad	1	*	Conservative party don't campaign on it, but privatisation of the NHS is one of their major aims.
t1_dsadyas	1	*	money, guns, and religion. 
t1_dulxdtn	0	*	It's not limiting anything, just protecting the historical truth and facts.
t1_dutjshn	0	*	Sorry dude, moved on to r/worldjerking   check it out 
t1_duuh8c7	0	*	He must be, because why would a Russian person defend Russia, that's unthinkable!
t1_duu3lwo	0	*	Weekend Update is also presented in a news format...
t1_duutdki	1	*	That would be nationalistic, not patriotic. 
t1_dt0k4p7	0	*	What was the alternative? They worked fine together before, why would they not reasonably compromise now? 
t1_dsko9gc	0	*	> Palestinian Authority that rewards terrorists  This I did not know. Do you have a source?
t1_dskp4di	1	*	Lol you're hurling Nazi blood libels at the allies just so you can talk shit about Arabs. 
t1_dsq131g	1	*	The only other ppl reporting this are quoting this article. 
t1_dsm2phi	1	*	You shouldn't assume people's nationality.
t1_dskqrz5	0	*	That's a complete lie. Of course they defined borders. The surrounding countries invaded them because of it.
t1_dskvkzx	0	*	> I don't condone the murder of the kid in their sleep.  Nice reading comprehension skills you have there. US school system, per chance?
t1_dt777gl	0	*	>  I just haven't seen anything that isn't based on opinion or hasn't been debunked.   https://i.imgur.com/DAs4F9M.gif
t1_dt83arr	1	*	I can't believe that you think that being wrong is lying.   You need to admit that there is a difference between being incorrect and lying.  This is really easy to understand.
t1_dt77ukp	0	*	Chicago tribune lol. It's a leftist sensationalist rag.
t1_dt7osmb	0	*	Dijon is usually much more spicy than that artificially-looking yellow,  sweet stuff you Americans call mustard. 
t1_dt7zczt	0	*	I see. Sorry, as I said I'm not a US citizen so this is all very confusing to me. So in short the president is privileged in the face of the law? 
t1_dt7d1he	0	*	Ah yes. The democrats. The perfect example of a tip top political party. 
t1_dt8jcad	1	*	Yeah. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dX8ya0rsFtE  And if you think that's bad, [look up what repubs had to say about him wearing a tan suit.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7kNSNPwuSjQ)
t1_dt7brlj	1	*	Nah, I just know how to use the term in a perfect world correctly.
t1_dt7w1fm	1	*	It was an ugly suit and it was a slow news day, Republicans aren't the only person to point it out. The only person who got irate was Rep Peter King and he at least justified it with a good reason. 
t1_dt7lde6	0	*	[How about spicy mustard with chilli then...?](http://www.loewensenf.de/typo3temp/_processed_/csm_loewensenf_chili_feurig_01_d8734470a5.png)

t1_dt7vq98	1	*	No, THIS IS PATRICK!
t1_dtab8pa	0	*	I'm not embarrased
t1_dtawx8l	1	*	This attitude is the exact reason trump is in office. 
t1_dt9u4sp	0	*	You mean balancing out positives with negatives?  Isn't that just called balanced reporting?  Isn't that what the news should be?
t1_dtaobub	1	*	It's in the Geneva Convention
t1_dtaqwdb	0	*	What? 
t1_dt9w92g	0	*	Except tariffs on Mexican goods are paid by the Americans people who purchase those goods, not the people who make them.  Tariffs would mean U.S. citizens were paying for the wall.
t1_dtb8b7l	1	*	someone just needs to sort your posts by controversial to realize the reason you'd say something ridiculous like that  my favorite has to be white liberals are the REAL racists!
t1_dtak2cp	0	*	Trump popularized it, but the term was actually *coined* to attack him and the conservative media. 
t1_dtag2o9	0	*	He has yet to tell anyone that they can't speak. Saying something is fake isn't the same as telling someone they can't say it.
t1_dtaxbae	0	*	Didn't they vote on that a month or so ago and it failed horribly? How will you live with yourself if he is still president 7 years from now?
t1_dtanxpq	0	*	Well now you're assuming the intention of laughs. 
t1_dtbegvp	1	*	Trump reads...if it's something that has his name appear a lot. And pictures, lots of pictures.
t1_dt9vkin	0	*	How can the tax bill have caused those things when it hasn't even gone into effect yet?
t1_dtaqs8f	0	*	You're saying Obama never talked unnecessary shit?
t1_dtaiqfx	1	*	Yea and didn't they upgrade Trump's? I could be wrong but it was one of the first news reports when he became president.
t1_dt9ul1n	0	*	You weren't alive under Reagan. He did better on all counts. 
t1_dt9vvtg	1	*	>  CEO's are world leaders whether you like it or not  those are some heavy goalposts.
t1_dtag96j	1	*	> Give me a fucking break dude.  I'm not saying I agree with it but it's what's happening and what will always happen. Especially since Reddit is going for a social feel on their mobil app. 
t1_dtapic1	1	*	he has ClapShazam^TM installed

t1_dtfpryq	1	*	Are u mistaking the distinction of the doping cheating on a individual case by case to a whole state funded and backed program.

t1_dt8epsh	0	*	You've not actually defended yourself here. You're causing pain when an animal doesn't do what you want because it's easier than putting a bit of time into training it.
t1_dt8h9hj	0	*	You're telling me the only way to train an animal is to cause it pain if it doesn't obey you.
t1_dt8asft	1	*	And waterboarding is just interrogation technique until it's your turn to be on the table.
t1_dt8iwu6	0	*	Whatever you need to tell yourself to defend your animal torture fetish.  I really hope the state bans you from owning animals.

t1_dt83c65	0	*	What part of being responsible for an animal do you not understand?
t1_dt8hz4x	1	*	Shock collars hurt dogs. THEIR ENTIRE REASON IS TO HURT THE DOG. Its use is illegal in the entire EU for a reason. 
t1_dt8p479	0	*	Try getting electrocuted while orgasming and you'll find out, it's really hard to describe how different it feels.
t1_dtd6fhk	1	*	Find a better cause. 
t1_dtyyhwe	0	*	For pretty much any reason really, the police definitely do have total freedom of speech, so much so that they can just make up any reason for killing someone. 
t1_dtzvz9w	1	*	86 years ago, most people didnt take them seriously. Until they were democratically elected and started a World War.
t1_du07q52	0	*	You are now twisting and fabricating in a fantasy whirlwind of your own design. Someday maybe you'll learn to ask someone what they mean, instead of going full PCP Rick James up in this bitch.
t1_dtz37j6	0	*	So are you suggesting that Neo Nazis and members of the alt right are being allowed to murder people whenever they want? Is that what you are claiming?
t1_dtz8ng9	0	*	And if the person with the most votes from the population (demos...) wins.
t1_dtzo73e	1	*	It doesn't bother me that much either that a totalitarian fascist insults me, I just wanted to answer in kind.
t1_dtz2vl6	0	*	You're acting like antisemitism hasn't been becoming more blatant worldwide, not just the USA. This shit never goes away, it just comes in waves. 
t1_du05ouq	0	*	Are you freakin kidding me? The Nazi's never censured Jewish or Zionist propaganda? I feel like I'm arguing with goldfish or something. What do they teach you in school these days
t1_dtywkc5	0	*	Why does it matter that you have a 'separation' between powers when in both countries you can and do land in prison for expressing your thoughts?
t1_dtz7mgf	1	*	You think you can't be a nazi, because you support capitalism? I think that is the dumbest thing I will read all day.
t1_dtzn5r8	0	*	To be fair, anyone who was part of the SS was deemed a criminal at Nuremberg because the entire SS was sentenced as a criminal organisation
t1_dtyv6k6	0	*	I think I misunderstood what you meant. I thought you were talking about hate speech laws as overreaching laws and were talking from the position of an American.
t1_du06kan	0	*	Because they're trying to play the legal game while jerking off over the helter skelter shit. 
t1_dtz7qdg	1	*	Just to point out, people in the UK talk all the time while hanging around too. Just not in the underground. 
t1_duwzfe0	0	*	Suppose that's true. Does that suddenly mean the imperialism of the last couple hundred years didn't have a white character, or we should just get over it?
t1_duds3qx	0	*	My friends that work in them after grad school are doing quite well  What do you think is best?
t1_duc9y9d	0	*	So artists, authors, and any other creative people shouldn't be paid for their work?  She wrote a few books.  She got paid a few dollars for every copy that was sold.  Seems pretty harmless to me.
t1_dta8djr	1	*	Trump would push you into traffic if it meant solidifying his power.
t1_dtwqml2	1	*	war heroes are people too, just because someone did something worthy of recognition in battle doesnt mean theyre perfect. Plenty of terrible men are great warriors.
t1_dtwt9ep	1	*	It's a matter of diplomacy, not intimidation. Almost everyone recognizes him as a dictator, both those in close quarters with him and those with strong diplomatic ties.
t1_dtwltwu	1	*	Whatever you want to call them, there is a distinction between Palestinians and Israeli Arabs, or if you prefer, Israeli Palestinian citizens and non citizens.

t1_dutf1mf	1	*	Agreed.
t1_dsqasbp	1	*	Saying 3000 is fine here. It's nothing more than a rounding error.  He's just trying to divert the conversation.
t1_dsqgsvx	1	*	Sorry about that, I guess you can say the Brits legalized the immigration retroactively when they had the UN proposed a two-state solution.
t1_dsrmnm6	0	*	Having a state would magically transform the innocent Gazans to bloodthirsty monsters for electing Hamas?

t1_dsgitg3	1	*	You missed the first part of my comment.  Your taxes will bounce back, corporations get to enjoy it longer.
t1_dsgpinn	0	*	You said that it wasn't a moral issue but an economic one.  The idea is that it isn't just limited to an economic issue. It's absolutely a moral issue as well.

t1_dsgo20z	0	*	Aaaannnnd this is why the motherfucker refused for release his tax returns. 
t1_dsghyuk	1	*	Win six times in Trumpland.
t1_dsgou6m	1	*	Obama was supposed to be different too, not be an ass to whistleblowers and not be so imperialistic. He did the opposite of that and thanks to that America now has Trump.
t1_dsgj5fm	0	*	Not to mention the plain and simple fact that Obama isn't President anymore.  Trump is, and the fact that Obama supported it doesn't change the fact that Trump chose to do it on his own watch.
t1_dsgjhm4	0	*	It took many years to impeach Nixon. Dunno why y'all think that just because it hasn't happened to Trump in 1 year that the whole thing is a fluke.

t1_dsgp5vu	0	*	This might be hard to hear but it sounds like your parents don't like brown people. That's pretty much the only explanation in that (very common) situation you're in.
t1_dsgraur	1	*	Seriously. I got down voted in another thread for pointing out that they have essentially weaponized stupidity. It's a powder keg waiting to ignite.
t1_dsgifqo	1	*	What a good analogy! 
t1_dsgonwi	1	*	So THAT is how double-think/speak started. I always had issues rationalizing how someone could do those in the book. Now it makes sense though.
t1_dshm67q	1	*	Subscribed
t1_dsgsznh	0	*	> Trump has hurt them more than Obama ever did but they wont say shit.   Honestly curious, how so? If anything at least their retirement fund (if they do have one) skyrocketed in the past year.
t1_dsgir3e	1	*	But he's gonna change!  He's a total scumbag in business, so *he knows the loopholes and will close them!*  Being a pathological liar means *he can spot other people's lies*!  It's perfecT!!1!!
t1_dsiar9j	0	*	I was referring to Obama, who you asked about. 
t1_dsggu12	0	*	And while that may be a possibility, until it's been proven to happen there is nothing illegal about it. The president can't just forsake his duty because there is the potential for corruption.

t1_dsgqv5z	1	*	Nah. Centrism blows.
t1_dsgpua4	1	*	No, silly. Communism is when the guberment does stuff and captailism is like the market and shit. You clearly need to watch more PraguerU videos and learn *basic economics*.

t1_dsh6ami	0	*	About what issue specifically?
t1_dsgj4up	0	*	I did not and will not vote for Trump or anyone who relies on your line of reasoning. I would rather die and take all of the extortionists with me.
t1_dsgetel	1	*	And people who have liquid assets go around buying everything up for a song.  
t1_dsgug0a	0	*	Right, and that's not my point. I am simply annoyed at the very /r/YUROP attitude that always comes up in these articles.    
t1_dsgwedk	1	*	Nor was I suggesting to just do it. I also did not mention any particular country

t1_dsj6uk0	1	*	I just said I did. It's gossip. No documentation, all hearsay. The only real take away is that the Hillary camp paid a foreign nation to sway the election
t1_dshwnom	1	*	TIL. Never knew that before.
t1_dsgk3jc	1	*	Ha, it just so happens that almost everything gets 6k-8k upvotes but often only dozens of comments. No bots upvoting posts, Im sure. 
t1_dsi5qhr	0	*	I think increasing the risk for the shareholders would force these entities to be more careful.
t1_dsgiomn	0	*	Trump isn't impeached because he's a useful idiot. They can pass anything they want, he'll sign it and hail it as a victory, and he takes all the heat. 
t1_dsgujw0	1	*	And will continue to be!
t1_dsgkw7w	0	*	Yep. Typical of the part of my family who are Republicans and who live in the south.

t1_dsguk9b	0	*	So you're not really feeling pride and accomplishment, you're feeling *a feeling* of pride and accomplishment. That's some emotional inception right there.

t1_ducnn3e	0	*	Well, so long as it's somewhere we don't care about. To America's credit, we try not to bomb civilians. We can do better, but at least we try not to.

t1_dse9mzg	0	*	 No, they're a myth I'm pretty sure. 
t1_dseaydo	0	*	So it's acceptable for the government to put it's own citizens into the crossfire down the road? I wonder if Japan regrets not doing anything in the past because now their country can easily be hit.
t1_dseec6v	0	*	Spoken like a misinformed ten year old. Kudos! 
t1_dseffcp	0	*	Only problem is that if Trump gets stabbed to death in the Rotunda by the Senate, then using history as a guideline we'll be looking at civil war between Pence and Kushner for control of the US.

t1_dsdnolh	1	*	It would be okay if it was just this. Its more than that though. 
t1_dsdsex5	1	*	Putin is legitimately popular. People like to think that people just *say* they like him, because they're on camera. But that isn't the case; Russians genuinely do like Putin.
t1_dsdosak	0	*	Then you haven't looked. What the fuck, if you're going to take a stand you should know what ground you're standing on
t1_dsdw3ww	1	*	Nice typo

t1_dse5w64	0	*	> Difference is that junta was supported by the US and their primary target was to jail communists.   Do you think that the story was different for our case?
t1_dsdmix3	0	*	Yes, but it takes more than one country (in fact, it takes all of them) to allow a new member. Britain wanting Turkey to join is of no consequence as long as any other EU country is against it.
t1_dsdk2r0	1	*	Putin is popular. They don't need to fake elections or polls for that. When you have complete control of the media, you can do what you want. I don't know how you can gain the impression he isn't.

t1_dv2lvlw	0	*	Actually a lot of people who lived in upper canada at the time were american. There really wasnt a real border at the time. 1812 was a war no one wanted

t1_dv1oyw1	1	*	no, but we became a country in 1867.  in 1812 we were a british colony
t1_dv2l0qp	1	*	You have to. You never know when you, yourself will be considered the bottom 51%.   The bottom 51% of belief in God. The bottom 51% of respect of tradition. The bottom 51% of whiteness of skin. etc.

t1_du8caiz	1	*	I mean... the food pyramid was a sham but it also says to eat a bunch of vegetables every day and not to eat a bunch of sugar every day. 
t1_dtmjn1r	1	*	US-> Cheap electricity -> rich country -> fuck ton of pollution  Sure it works like that in Poland but cheaper electricity also leads to higher usage which also increases pollution.
t1_dteoyer	1	*	Well, it still drops off pretty damn fast. I think exponentially would serve as a colloquial description.
t1_dtfhw1f	1	*	You are right, for a current loop it is 1/r^3. I was thinking of the magnetic field from a small linear current, rather than a loop.  Mea culpa.

t1_dtesl02	0	*	they're both quite common, but also illegal as fuck?
t1_dtvfkso	1	*	I only take solace in the fact that at least in Moscow people are more accepting of gays. It's not Europe but it's not as bad as our other regions.

t1_dsrutlx	1	*	It's just a difference of opinion over a trivial matter. There is nothing for me to learn from reading your comment or vice versa.
t1_dss1jd2	1	*	in the same way, EQ isn't real, as it isn't something that's really measurable. IQ isn't a physical thing, but it is definitely quantifiable
t1_dsse3uu	1	*	Yes, we have 1000' ++++++++ sticks just laying around...
t1_dss1gia	0	*	the point here is that we already have a vocabulary that adequately describes the concept, and that EQ is just a trendy zero-content term

t1_dsb1e2j	1	*	Welcome to the democrat double talk circle.
t1_dsvnn1g	0	*	No it really doesnt. Harvey Weinsteins years of sexual abuse in Hollywood went public. That does not imply he came out and exposed his story to the public himself. 
t1_dsvw0o7	0	*	I understand the medical benefits, but roiding for the sake of it is banned for a reason. Dont be so obviously oblivious of the real issue at hand.
t1_dsw7z7l	1	*	Thats exactly what this is though. The Olympic committee is effectively his employer. Russia is just a glorified supervisor.
t1_dswo07h	1	*	Yeah I think China has an awful program too, if not for drugs, but the lifestyle they impose on their athletes
t1_dsw5bng	1	*	This guy horses

t1_dsw53lx	0	*	What on earth does this even mean?

t1_dsweyz5	1	*	You did but you treated the sheer expanse of Russias territory and climate as if it wasnt a natural defense which Yuktobania was correcting. 
t1_dswfvhf	1	*	So you want athletes to be forced to take harmful drugs to play sports? Fuck that.
t1_dswzda0	1	*	The argument could be made about the olympians themselves. Why take away their chance at a medal because their country did something wrong? 
t1_dsw33oh	1	*	Fine, that seems acceptable.
t1_dswfgej	1	*	Only Athletes that have a doping test record frlm outside russia are allowed

t1_dsw2ske	1	*	Classical conditioning baby, give me dat Pavlov shit.
t1_dswm2t0	1	*	Crimea invasion began after Yanokovich ran from Ukraine because of coup. Russia seized an opportunity during the power vacuum in Ukraine. It had absolutely nothing to do with Olympics, lol.
t1_dsvvga0	0	*	There it is, the personal focus because you cant back your shit up. Guess were done here.
t1_dsyyhec	1	*	You can do the exact same with a dog and have them go on command rather than wait until the damn animals feels like it. Trained animals are the best, kinda like educated humans.

t1_dsxdbs7	1	*	Rofl why do people act like the other athletes aren't using too.  If only Russia was using they'd absolutely dominate everyone, the difference in performance would be so insane.

t1_dt2olqq	1	*	if they are ignoring the USA then why are you supporting them.. does that mean that they are increasing CO2 emissions.. because we are cutting ours
t1_dt2si7g	0	*	no.. why should we care what the globalists think? they will come crawling back to daddy as soon as they feel threatened.. people love to hate America.. until they need us.. then they love us..

t1_dsmfs99	1	*	Vietnam has an increasingly free market economy  and Life has improved there since that happened but it's still full of corruption and hardship.
t1_dsmcmqd	1	*	Yeah back then there wasn't really liberal or conservative schism they way you see things here. There was, but it was the Progressive Party.  There used to be more 3rd party power.

t1_dsea0z1	0	*	They say the market always acts ethically? Where?
t1_dsdolvc	0	*	Well, pooling money is a way to help poorer people gain influence. A rich person can spend more than a poorer person. However, by combining resources they may be able to spend more.

t1_dt2u5ww	0	*	How is that even relevant?
t1_dt2iop2	0	*	To be fair, they'd both end up on trial before anything bad happened, not immediately lethally injected in a van and liquefacted for burial like all the Chinese citizens whose names we'll never know.
t1_dt2v2c9	0	*	There is no social safety net in China, do that's out no matter what. If you don't have a Hokou (the living permit) you aren't permitted to rent/buy a home, go to school, or work.

t1_dt2t985	1	*	Do you think theres going to be any push for mass education in the current govt?
t1_dt2ipjc	1	*	They can eat freedom and drink liberty. Nobody before America deserved to live. Thats why the Indians wisely gave way to future Americans.

t1_dt3pyaz	1	*	Whenever there is a positive China post someone says X is fake and china killed millions of people every time. The wording is so similar every time I'm convinced it is astroturfing.
t1_dt3smyg	1	*	Yeah, India also will balkanize if it ever becomes autocratic. Just too many divisions in India to paper over.
t1_dt2o2rc	0	*	The NSA gives no fucks about any ToS you signed. In fact ToS are only relevant between the user and company, most of them aren't read in the first place. 
t1_dt3qxtu	0	*	What are you on about? Ive only said that I disagree with a government murdering peaceful protestors. I said nothing about everyone should be democratic.
t1_dt2jjp9	1	*	Hell they probably would be in the exact same condition if they had anarchy. Every single democratic nation in the world does better.
t1_dt2i3dh	1	*	That would be almost a decade after South Korea transitioned to a Democracy   and the policies SK was forced to enact were austerity measures that have nothing to do with democratizing a government. 
t1_dt2jsms	0	*	Wow, you literally have more freedom to move around the  EU than within China.

t1_dsr46ch	1	*	To be fair much of that is because of *federal* regulation, instituted by lobbyists from (for example) catalytic converter production companies.
t1_dsrertz	1	*	From what I have read if you transplant the full emission system from the donor car it can be deemed legal. 
t1_dsrjjb8	1	*	Sounds like you should get your prostate checked.
t1_dsrokzw	0	*	It's rather disingenuous to say that per capita levels don't matter, no? Anyone can immediately realize that population levels matter when measuring pollution outputs.
t1_dsr31a7	0	*	So government funded, aka new taxes or you have to cut the budget of something else. 
t1_dsr62hq	0	*	Particulate emissions is a larger problem in cities than CO2, you need to do both
t1_dsr2ok9	1	*	A Catback exhaust replaces what is behind the catalytic converters.  They don't necessarily add or remove noise, they can just change the tone or remove unpleasant droning.
t1_dsr6yzr	1	*	i just got back from shanghai. air was actually really great. not sure what the other person's talking about. i was in pudong. 
t1_dsrfkk1	1	*	Either that or the two redditors are cousins.

t1_dsr1tto	0	*	Cali
t1_dsr1wjo	1	*	I doubt it is, but does sound like a Mitch Hedberg line. lol
t1_dsr0gus	0	*	You will never see people wearing masks in LA. I care about my lungs saying that you need a mask to breathe is a little over the top. 
t1_dsr2bqp	0	*	worst than bakersfield, CA?
t1_dssczk2	1	*	Assuming you're right because I haven't looked it up myself, that's actually pretty interesting.  Is it just that it tends to learn towards more heat so people call it global warming?
t1_dsr5mod	1	*	California isn't an entity, so it can't believe anything. He just emphasized that.
t1_dssc1wl	1	*	Im pretty sure Flint dosent have a trillion dollar economy 
t1_dsrneon	1	*	Iron Eyes Cody wasn't gagging on CO2, lad.
t1_dsr4r21	1	*	now that's a piss rich verse!
t1_dsrhbhr	0	*	> we can safely conclude that all uncles are smart.  Can confirm.  Source: am uncle.
t1_dsrmvt0	1	*	Oh, it's believable.
t1_dsr3aby	1	*	Also I think the farming equipment throws out a lot of dust at times.
t1_dsr34tv	0	*	> Edit: Enjoy your heavy metals.  I will, thank you.
t1_dsr9jt5	1	*	Getting water on there might need a lot of impacts U0001f601 Also seems easier than a lot of the other solutions....though a tad dangerous 
t1_dsr72pz	1	*	Bakersfield probably worse than Beijing. But then again, I just hate that city 
t1_dss42fh	0	*	I don't think they are hacking stations either but not because of not wanting to ruin their peace talks. The peace talks are nothing except to try and gain global favor and drop sanctions. 
t1_dstz6ip	0	*	Didn't say it did. But they have every right to develop nuclear weapons, especially considering they're in the crosshairs of the most imperialistic nation.
t1_dssb3mg	1	*	I wasn't really trying to debate details, I'm just agreeing with the original commenter that it wasn't the Japanese government that made the announcement, technically. 
t1_dsshsdv	0	*	>Need I remind you about the millions killed in the Korean war?   The Korean war that began when the North crossed the 38th parallel & tried to invade the South?

t1_dsmafmy	0	*	Uh... what manufactured goods do prisoners make?  Like a real number
t1_dsl8erz	1	*	FWIW, you seem pretty calm to me and I didn't interpret your original statement any differently.
t1_dsnarel	1	*	No, it's every country with religion in positions of power. Us, Australia, UK, Russia etc
t1_dsnia4w	1	*	A great example.
t1_dsn5a06	0	*	Sorry, what country is Baltimore in again?
t1_dsl224x	0	*	That is correct. When they have a political motive they are called terrorists. I thought that was understood as the premise of my comment. edit: rather, it was the premise to which I responded.
t1_dsn6dqj	1	*	or Texas shit would get real.
t1_dtv1vl6	1	*	No, Christian is the fish.
t1_dtu8rry	0	*	Why not set up resources for women to report abuse rather than assume anyone dressed in a way you dont like must be a victim of oppression? Seems pretty bigoted. 
t1_dtutzxl	0	*	Because all the 15 year old boys would get erections duh! What do you think the Islamic dress codes are for? They are simply erection prevention.
t1_dtujfe9	1	*	Ooh, ok. That makes more sense.

t1_duxf14l	0	*	That may be the case, but you go use heroin once a day and I'll go drink a six pack once a day and we can reconvene in a week to see who had a worse experience. 
t1_duy7u01	0	*	I'm pretty sure heroin withdrawal can be deadly as well. Also it's pretty bad for your veins to repeatedly inject an opioid into your veins. You're painting a ridiculously good picture of heroin here.
t1_dux68ti	0	*	Here are 10 street drugs more dangerous than alcohol.  http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/from-krokodil-to-purple-drank-the-worlds-10-most-deadly-street-drugs-a6719541.html
t1_duz4dau	1	*	Unless you count the cost of time and frustration in dealing with black market dealers.
t1_duxievi	1	*	Then we should ban everything. Alcohol,  sugar,  vending machines,  tide pods. That logic makes no sense. 
t1_duybzdu	1	*	>Jumping straight to legalizing everything is bad idea that is likely to backfire...  Why?
t1_duxb9wr	0	*	I'm not saying alcohol is NOT an addictive and destructive drug.  It's just not in the Top 3 as was stated.
t1_ds3y33r	0	*	The punishment fits the crime. 
t1_ds4kvlq	1	*	Their bikes werent at risk?

t1_ds4t6ob	1	*	Haha, sorry, totally messed up what I was thinking there. I meant to put that we kept propping him up, even though thats not something America should do.
t1_ds4hv91	1	*	So you're saying America ISN'T overrun with inbreeding hicks?   Looking at our current president you might need a better example lol
t1_du4ajtm	0	*	Well GMT without daylight savings is UTC.
t1_du4duyc	1	*	[Sure](https://www.google.com/search?q=daylight+savings+kills)
t1_du4cyif	0	*	Implying everything has to be rounded up and nothing can be rounded down? All the rules of market competition go out the window? Why?
t1_du5be6o	1	*	How much data and how many GB a day do you get?
t1_du5lueq	0	*	So fuck-em?
t1_du4k0pq	1	*	Perhaps the US should use their military Zulu time? 
t1_du4f0k4	1	*	The change is gradual so I'm sure I'd adjust.
t1_du48ueo	0	*	I guess we cancel out then, because I'm not worried about it at all
t1_du49lw3	0	*	Right now you have the problem as well when you have to coxf6rdinate between US and EU businesses, because the DST switch happens at different dates, several weeks apart.
t1_du5rij0	1	*	In that case, daylight saving time should be classified as debt, since it's borrowing money. 
t1_du4h0ll	1	*	My personal feeling is that on days where I wake up where it's already light outside I am happier. Standing um when it's dark is a bit depressing.  So I don't mind the DST.
t1_du5y1kb	1	*	Simple they are thick as mince so just tell them the U in UTC stands for United States 
t1_du5jvwx	0	*	uh, you still need *timezones* unless you want someone to be in night at 3am and someone else to be in night at 1pm. Think you're confusing timezones and DST. 
t1_du4f2cy	0	*	screw that. Just let them stay behind with their inches and pounds. 
t1_du4as59	1	*	Where you beneath the halo of a street lamp when you tried it?
t1_du4dpze	0	*	Water freezes at 0xb0, boils at 100xb0. Such unnatural. Much weird.
t1_du4jf6j	1	*	0xb0F is the freezing point of salt water, and 100 was originally the average body temp of a healthy person.
t1_du66ke0	1	*	Yes. This is much easier than just keeping daylight savings time. 
t1_du5tzki	0	*	Not hard to justify if you want to be reelected.
t1_du5tn8d	1	*	Im 1%! Thats whats up 
t1_du4be95	1	*	And everything that costs 22 cents is now 20 cents. It balances out.
t1_du4gjn7	0	*	I'm also confused and not really sure what's going on.  TLDR; I like the clock springing forward and falling back.
t1_du674nm	0	*	changing working hours en masse involves a whole host of issues that makes it more efficient to just change the clocks.    DSTs are just part of the standard
t1_dtz1da7	0	*	Yes clean coal is cleaner.....  Its not a bad idea when you think how cheap coal is and how dependent a lot of the world is still on coal.
t1_dtcuecl	0	*	So, we're supposed to give praise that 45 stepped in and stopped his corrupt people from doing something wrong? Is this supposed to be noteworthy, and not run of the mill?
t1_dsyrlne	1	*	If you owe the bank 3 trillion dollars and then refuse to pay that debt the bank would collapse.  
t1_dsyj129	1	*	Nah, he just wasn't as bad as Hillary to a very large swath of the electorate. Lots of people voted for him because they despised him less than the other option.
t1_dt7ipin	0	*	Enlighten me. I have looked and can find nothing that mentions cloning (from an already live animal) of monkeys prior to this instance.
t1_dt81jn6	0	*	Agreed. I don't think there is *any* good test of consciousness.
t1_du90tbw	1	*	No I dont understand what their government have anything to do with anything. Honest no idea where you were going with it.
t1_dt7cmep	0	*	Which tunnels, those to Israel or to Egypt?  The fact that you don't distinguish makes your comment worthless noise.
t1_dt8397a	0	*	None else can build tunnels in Gaza other than Hamas. So they do have a monopoly there.
t1_dtmh4ra	1	*	Lmao he is not a muslim. He himself has stated he is a christian.

t1_dtmnweq	1	*	Oh not in Utica, no. It's an Albany expression.
t1_dtma15t	0	*	FarewellTrumpDefenderAddress poster above brought up popularity. Why are you defending him if you don't agree with him?
t1_dtmb1zt	0	*	Liberal Morality War? That's a new one, who's been touting that line on their radio show? 
t1_dtmzckm	0	*	You were quite wrong, the memo is beyond damning. As we suspected for a year now, the entire Russian collusion story was concoted by political enemies to undermine a duly elected President.
t1_dtmnyka	1	*	Is that the one that goes on glass or is that a Boston steamer?
t1_dtlzned	1	*	You mean the fake memo that will be dissected and come to conclusion that will be partisan Bs and will only help dems and Muller tac on another obstruction charge to that orange orangutan.
t1_dtmfmcu	1	*	Yup!~  Except some of us (wink wink) keep living through their sore losers/winners for months on end, ignoring reality.
t1_dtmyp10	1	*	liberal morality war = People made me feel bad for thinking and saying shitty things about others, so I punished them by voting a loud mouth bigot into the highest office in the country.
t1_dtmhyba	0	*	Dude. Stop. You are embarrassing yourself.  Please pay attention. 
t1_dtlyw00	0	*	This from a random troll who thinks the alt right is alright, that's like saying the kkk is alright.

t1_dtly8uo	1	*	I'm not sure if the irony hit you hard enough with that one.  Go back to shitposting in t_d and trolling trump posts elsewhere.
t1_dtly967	1	*	Hillary isn't the President. Get over it.
t1_dtlv2mf	0	*	The fact that you're calling yourself altright is ironic. 
t1_dtm8lhk	1	*	Trump won by 40-80k votes spread across 3 key states. I don't know why they feel that margin of victory is insurmountable.
t1_dua0242	1	*	Urine damages the lawn because it has salt in it.
t1_du9y9n9	0	*	> We're on school shooting 19 this year.   No we are not. Having a shooting down the street from a school doesn't count as a school shooting. I beg you to name 5.

t1_du9hyps	0	*	The only reason you have those shootings is cos you have guns. We have no guns and thus have no school shootings. Ever.
t1_du9cpxb	0	*	The people who, ...regard it as it's own seperate entity would be mistaken. It's in Africa. Stop trying to cleave off a part of the continent because it better suits your world view. 
t1_dub4wpy	1	*	I honestly really liked dks2, but on its own. 
t1_du9e0pz	1	*	Nah peeing outside is relaxing  Source: am male
t1_du9k37m	0	*	Let's be honest, the only reason people don't say DS3 also falls short is alllllll that nostalgia to DS1 they threw in. DS1 is, and will always be, the best Soulsborne.

t1_dsor61a	0	*	Obviously more, since a bus holds fewer than 200 people.
t1_dsoq6ks	0	*	How is comparing a bus to an electric car that everyone doesn't have relevant? 
t1_dsw6abr	0	*	True, true. I didn't consider the amazon as fresh water for some reason.
t1_dswec9m	1	*	Hey give them some credit, they aren't killing farmers anymore, they finished most of them off a while ago.
t1_dswdcl7	1	*	I was thinking of it being more of a thing you do alongside a much better solution. But it being a temporary solution itself works too. Which brings what you said into question. And it's very true. 
t1_dsvxey4	0	*	Because this showed a 25 liter container on wheels. Figured it gave a better representation of the scale. And I agree, it seems overpriced.

t1_dt45qfb	0	*	Hardly, people shouldn't be aiding criminals, it is in the same boat as helping hide a know rapist, you wouldn't do that would you? 
t1_dtcfvt1	0	*	It's an anti-fact because it's totally irrelevant and when you were called out on it you said it doesn't meet the strict definition of what you said it was.
t1_dtd0vci	1	*	And in doing so making those who live in more populated states second class citizens as far as our elections are concerned.
t1_dtcwih1	0	*	He won't answer cause it's bullshit. The electoral college was put in place in order to prevent a few high population places make decisions for the whole country. 
t1_dtcweqb	1	*	Individual votes from lower-population states (which tend to go republican) are given more weight than individual votes from higher-population states (which tend to go democrat).

t1_dtcy9bw	0	*	But then wouldnt voters without ID have a huge impact?
t1_dtd8swe	1	*	Uhh, their point was exactly the opposite of yours, that California isn't getting enough votes, not that they have too many. Nice try though. 
t1_dtkxsp4	1	*	If theyre handed a subpoena you would be amazed how far companies will move. 
t1_dtd57kb	1	*	Urban centers still dominate at the state level, and the tons of rural people in Texas still get disenfranchised. It's a dumb system.

t1_dtcbrq1	1	*	Dude find it yourself. I dont need to source it. 
t1_dthf7jg	0	*	Sure? At least as clean as usual. I was asking what makes an organization  nefarious for you. 
t1_dtd86cn	1	*	> The thing I don't get is why can't they just count the number of votes in total and award presidency that way.  Russian bots, obv. 
t1_dtcs901	1	*	Or if you're a baker. 
t1_dtd0tkp	1	*	Best way to solve it would be to increase the size of Congress so larger states are more fairly represented. But all states get a minimum of three.

t1_ds7vebd	0	*	The media itself isn't retarded. Some of the stories they put out might be, but not the media itself.
t1_ds7q9fp	0	*	Given that he deleted his comment it may be safe to assume that he was gravely misinformed.

t1_ds8ftuv	0	*	Purely speculative, Kim will control the north still but trade will be available to the country from the south lets see how this plays out and we can discuss it more. I enjoy these debates 
t1_dscfcdb	1	*	I'm not saying that the US wasn't antagonizing North Korea, simply that the hypothetical North Korean threat was out of proportion, which the person who it responded to seemingly didn't.
t1_ds7p6z8	0	*	Yeah I'm sure a unilateral strike with no declaration of war with the purpose of wiping NK off the map is a great idea.
t1_ds8s6nr	1	*	The ICBM is the harder to test and develop the theory of.  The hardest part is to physically create the warhead by centrifuging the uranium. 
t1_ds9dead	1	*	I'm not defending his actions, I'm saying it didn't make reddit a echochamber like you claim. Simple as that.
t1_ds7wmcq	0	*	> objectivity  I knew what you meant, but it bothered me anyway :/
t1_ds81qvp	0	*	Sure he technically had another choice but it would result in certain death.  If your choice is do the thing or die you don't really have a choice.
t1_ds87ium	1	*	All I see in your comment is that you're desperate to only hear bad about Trump, to further validate your beliefs.  I don't like Trump, but it's good to stay objective. I'd recommend you do the same.

t1_dsg6yn4	1	*	It's definitely a reason to be suspicious, and the fact that a conspiracy forum ignores it makes it extra suspicious.  Also try posting anti-Trump stuff there, I was banned for it.

t1_dsg78v0	1	*	That's true, but there's a difference between economic diplomacy and bribery, and I take it the person you responded to was talking about the latter.

t1_dsg7aht	1	*	Well said mate. This is one of the drivers in so many parts of the world. Iran right now is a good example where the (western) cultural drivers are influencing the younger population. 
t1_dsg16a1	1	*	No, not what I said. My comment was pretty short, I suggest rereading it.

t1_dsg16n9	0	*	your president certainly uses that exact phrase all the time, and don't you trust him?
t1_dsg7gy8	1	*	It's suspicious though. Immediately after the 'exodus', as they call it, they started added Unverified tags to Trump-Russian theories.
t1_dshihne	1	*	See, Ukraine. See, the African continent.
t1_dsg9rr0	0	*	Its a liberal conspiracy! They just cant stand Trump as President, which is exactly why I voted for him. Drain the swamp, lock her up, MAGA!  - What people I work with have said.

t1_dt8bl1d	0	*	If they get NK's nukes they don't need US's protection anymore. 
t1_dt99bct	1	*	Im sure they would try if they could. With US hegemony around the world the ccps military really doesnt have much room to move outside its borders without a US response.
t1_dt8h7db	0	*	Your comment double posted by the way
t1_dtbiah2	1	*	I agree but still U.S. due to its geographical position relies on alliances to operate overseas.
t1_dt87mow	0	*	Iraq?
t1_dt8lx63	0	*	Isnt there an old ass agreement where America is allowed to stay in Guantanamo? I wanna say it was the treaty that ended the Spanish-American War. 
t1_dt8rx9k	0	*	To ease tension with China. A unified Korea would see much more benefits staying on china's good side rather than USA. 
t1_dt81ynp	0	*	What the fuck did I just read lmao
t1_dt84qp5	0	*	Especially buffets
t1_dt8btsb	1	*	How so?

t1_dt8r7xo	0	*	> We back whoever gives us the strategic advantage we want at the time.  Oh wow, that's pretty interesting! Who does you and your team have eyed-up to get backing for your next strategic advantage?
t1_dt8a2uh	0	*	Doesn't NK have some of the richest and rarest of PGE's on the planet though?
t1_dt8bkhw	0	*	also the only reason Lybia gave them up was because of extreme external economic pressure. It was not out of any sense of goodwill the world twisted there arm. 
t1_dt8ajaw	0	*	I agree, shallow AND pedantic 
t1_dt853em	0	*	If it came down to it, I'm wondering if they would keep the homegrown stuff or like a lot of nato countries use a US based derived system. 
t1_dt9n956	1	*	All three dictators and then the rest are 7 democratic presidents.
t1_dt8foxo	1	*	It's bad because Trump wants it and he's a big bad meanie who doesn't like the Lgbt world
t1_dt8bx5d	1	*	He said nuclear program.
t1_dtxj2jk	0	*	You should go back learning Vietnamese because the phase in Vietnamese is Tien len xa hoi chu nghia not  fucking Tien len cong san. 
t1_dtyksxu	1	*	None necessary, the EU has stated multiple times that A50 can be revoked by the UK at any time.

t1_dtxmjxz	1	*	Yeah that's how voting works, you go vote.
t1_dtxj3i0	0	*	Globalism is rich elites trying to subvert democracies and create a tyrannical gloabal government. It has nothing to do with Judaism. Can't believe people trust the ultra rich elites.
t1_dtxn9nz	1	*	Or it's the media screaming about Trump 24/7 while largely overlooking the barbarism of the third world / the third world in general.
t1_dtxs23t	0	*	Sure you did.   And I saw Putin say Trump was a good lay. Can't find the video but I think it may have been on info wars or maybe a Facebook meme. Too much big stuff going on to find it though.  
t1_dtybi3t	0	*	How is a 4 percent victory a marginal percentage victory?
t1_dty35zr	0	*	and the context and explanation that go with it.........which differ from your narrative
t1_dtxqihh	1	*	holy buzzword batman
t1_dtxkieg	1	*	Your president is a weak man's idea of a strong man. An idiot's idea of a genius. A coward's idea of a brave man. Absolutely fucking embarrassing!
t1_dtya70c	0	*	The email investigation concluded before the texts were written, unless Obama had a secret time machine it has been debunked.
t1_dtxhgsz	0	*	> Grow up.
t1_dtzglo9	0	*	Go to the top of this comment chain. This conversation is literally about Trump and Brexit. You joined it late. It isn't my responsibility to bring you up to speed if you do that.

t1_dtxmhu9	0	*	Any which are a consequence of EU law.
t1_dtxnvxd	0	*	Well #1 it's become public knowledge that Russia carried out a massive propaganda campaign to make it happen. 
t1_du0frzf	1	*	Yeah, but the guy was literally ex-FSB and is now a billionaire. 
t1_dtzfj71	1	*	well that killed any jokes I had lmao  well played my good dude ... well played!
t1_dtxjm7s	0	*	So it doesn't make sense to you that most rich people would like to have no restrictions and no democracies?
t1_dst6vrq	0	*	I said world wide.

t1_dt8vhvz	1	*	> There are fan clubs with millions of members.               Yeah, you might want to check the logs for where those bots are coming from.
t1_dsb61xc	1	*	> There's no successful socialist countries in the 20th century.  Define successful. The USSR for example was a superpower for almost 50 years.

t1_dtal2yg	1	*	Ok  http://www.scholarsstrategynetwork.org/brief/misleading-myth-voter-fraud-american-elections
t1_dta8doy	0	*	Know. You know what I meant. 
t1_dtaimkt	0	*	It is true. Hillary literally lost because she was so stupid with her email server.
t1_dtaf3nq	1	*	Tell Putin that he needs to provide more funding to teaching you guys English, because clearly your English reading comprehension isn't quite up to par.
t1_duvkz5v	0	*	Every year the same damn thing. The end is Near! Can't it come already? Jesus that's the longest finish in history.
t1_duw013i	1	*	New Apocalypse?! I haven't even handled an end game crisis in the old Apocalypse! In now way I gonna install a new patch before finishing this decadent fox slave overlord game!
t1_ds9acja	0	*	Yeah, I realised that. Thats how most of them around here are tbh.
t1_dsc23tq	0	*	3,000ish which is a good thing last time I checked and I directly mentioned civilians so you really have no excuse for being so blatantly wrong.
t1_ds9hszn	0	*	They were the first country I mention and this coalition was formed 15 years ago....
t1_duxy72y	0	*	Okay... Lets see the EU tell the world to fuck itself because they are going to tax every company as if it were there own entities.  I am sure there will be no backlash or fallout from those actions.
t1_duxoj3h	1	*	Still not as big as the average American.
t1_duwo0s8	0	*	:))  Actually, it's you, who fails to grok the essence of the problem -- or the nuances and the wording of your own comments. But then again, you certainly don't seem to care
t1_dv2f958	0	*	And so is unemployment and social housing. These jobs pay far more than the average job here. And have a slew of advantages such as medical for whole family, dental and stock options
t1_duy9l2k	1	*	Yes, that's what Spoiler means in this context. 
t1_duy0h5v	1	*	Knock yourself out champ, I'll wait for the pictures. 
t1_duwju4b	0	*	Ireland had been infamous for this, Apple is just the largest and most obvious company exploiting the Irish/Dutch sandwich tax evasion ploy.
t1_dux5dvs	1	*	Ewe are correct.
t1_duwszvd	1	*	it's more than a title. it allows them to indefinitely hold tax free cash there. 
t1_duwh2vf	0	*	Ah fair, in that case I've  *experienced* Wal-Mart
t1_duwiaiw	0	*	S&P EURO vs S&P:  https://i.imgur.com/jxgAyqb.png
t1_duwwmgk	1	*	You don't get taxed twice, because you can directly deduct any taxes paid to the foreign government from what you owe the US. So in effect, you get taxed a maximum of the US tax rate in this case.
t1_duy13gx	0	*	Are you seriously talking about the lack of long term vision and / or investments in a thread, which started by mentioning Apple?  Please, spare me of your blind -- at the very best -- pathos.
t1_duwvhwz	1	*	At least get the R&M reference right, E.B. White.
t1_duxn3jo	1	*	It really isn't. It's a quarter of one percent of the total workforce. 0.25%. Cut the workforce in half, it's still only half a percent. 
t1_duwqv9a	1	*	:))
t1_duwln37	1	*	Earth Apples, like the Dutch say.
t1_duwrdtw	0	*	The offset from increased income taxes, capital gains, land/property, and sales would make up for s portion of that
t1_duwpu21	0	*	Why?  Does every company that sells to the EU require a presence there?  My company sells millions of dollars of product to the EU and we don't even have a main distribution hub there.
t1_duxhcog	0	*	Yes, not yet.   Any you're absolutely right on the tax deals. I mean, state-aid being illegal is basically the first rule of the EU. 
t1_duwhxlt	1	*	It really sucks if you have to deal with workers who actually have rights and representation. /s
t1_duws9nl	1	*	Its not just a title. Profits are assigned to the global HQ.
t1_duxilvg	0	*	wait if the CPC is centrist who is on the right?
t1_duxm9hp	1	*	Ah, damn. I'm not interested enough to pay for it.
t1_duxrcx9	1	*	I'm not a world leader, but all countries are in competition with one another--trade, resources, influence, finances, whatever.  Any advantage one can get in this competition is a benefit, I guess.
t1_duy6i18	1	*	I fight for truth. Any specific claims you'd like to disprove with facts or are you talking out your ass? Let me take a guess..
t1_duxpnff	1	*	Liberals are right with wearing left wing perfume.
t1_duyvm7y	0	*	We need more centrist politicians. The parties are inherently centrist but the people representing them are not. 
t1_du7dmrz	0	*	perhaps, but that existed under apartheid so they were no better.  People here are acting as if under apartheid, every black was living a comfy middle class existence or something.
t1_du6z46u	0	*	And what was the alternative to neo liberalism? Communism?
t1_du6qgtr	0	*	Better*
t1_du6q89p	0	*	Correct, they were not committing any genocide. Africans can do that themselves.
t1_du69kkw	0	*	But how is the situation worse than 1994?
t1_dsoatc1	0	*	Yes, the Sunni Arabs were frustrated they could no longer subjugate and exploit the rest of Iraq freely.
t1_duup62x	0	*	I typically am, I think now that I know this Id love to do 2cups a day  I just dont know if thats safe? It sounds like it is but I dont want a heart attack
t1_duv3cdb	0	*	Hasn't. 
t1_duv1p4l	0	*	We easily go through 5# a month. I guess it's apples and oranges.
t1_duvdxt5	0	*	Wait are you actually serious and not exaggerating one bit? Even with insurance?
t1_duuy73e	1	*	You succeeded.
t1_duv8ctu	1	*	sperglords struggle with humor.
t1_dv0i1s7	0	*	Lmfao.  Russia is an enemy to the United States.  That isn't debatable.  We're in proxy wars and many argue the cold war is still going strong.  They just attacked us too. 
t1_duz813e	0	*	the US just became the 2nd largest oil producer, producing 10 million barrels per day, surpassing Saudi Arabia. We are on the path to exceed 11 millions barrels per day, which would surpass Russia...
t1_duzehzw	1	*	Saudi Arabia broke the back of the USSR by pumping out cheap oil and flooding the market. 
t1_duzn3yx	0	*	Also replace the beer with vodka.
t1_dv03ec3	0	*	I'm liberal too. But you see it all the time, people telling others not to ignore something because said someone don't like said source, then the first person goes and does the same thing. 
t1_dv014is	1	*	hell no. pence would be just george bush on steroids. sadly that would be an improvement
t1_duz9b03	0	*	JOHNY HAD NO BOAT FOR HIS DOCK  (good thing desmond child was there to help)
t1_duzdpqr	0	*	How about by count of people below the poverty line? Plenty of measures are possible beyond those you use. 
t1_duzdmpb	1	*	Large portions of the US struggle to meet developed. How developed it appears depends on how you look at the data. 
t1_duz9tq8	0	*	Don't you have some sort of shooting conspiracy to complain to the NRA about? 
t1_dv04z5g	1	*	It's called renewables, and the goal is to make oil less relevant everywhere.
t1_duzhak8	1	*	We're actually working on that.  Europe is building Liquid Natural Gas ports and infrastructure to reduce their dependence on Russian fossil fuels in favor of American natural gas.
t1_duzg8qr	1	*	Do you have a source on the president blocking Puerto Ricans?
t1_duzdv7y	1	*	nah let's be putin's puppets. - The GOP - Michael Scott
t1_duzco91	1	*	So if that's their plan they come to America, it's revealed they know nothing of substance and they get the boot back to Russia  
t1_dv02lc6	0	*	If you stop a US diplomatic car, you better be ready to go to war with the US. 
t1_duzg05h	0	*	> Per capita, it's Turkey followed by (are you sitting down?) Canada at a whopping 14 per 100k.  You're saying all that Canadian politeness is just a show to make it easier to kidnap you?
t1_duzkz9k	0	*	Switch to electric cars?  
t1_duzey0h	1	*	That's been the plan for the last 100 years lol  If you figure out how to subvert Russian oil without starting WWIII call up the Whitehouse and let them know
t1_duzhvzy	1	*	One correction though: you can't return to something if you never stopped doing it.
t1_duzriiy	1	*	Ill take my chances with Pence at this point.  He at least seems to have the ability to occasionally shut the fuck up. Trump is a loudmouth sociopath and an international embarassment. 
t1_duzi5s0	1	*	Exactly, it doesn't get as much in your head as opposed to being the dictator of Russia or something
t1_duz6j75	0	*	We tried that, and they annexed Crimea.
t1_duzjxy5	1	*	Its probably as close as you can get to the stereotypical, utopian, USSR that you can find in old Soviet films, yes. 
t1_duzfh5q	1	*	We are already doing that. Its why they have a struggling economy
t1_duzip9o	1	*	Europeans arent so hot on that.
t1_dv0fido	0	*	Wilders was supported by the same type of Russian propaganda campaign that they targeted the US/UK and right now Italy with. 
t1_duzmp5n	1	*	I'm going to call BS.  Those numbers for Canada _are not_ ransom kidnappings, certainly it's parents (as u/commissar_sae suggests.)
t1_dv0allu	1	*	And their flag is a big plus.
t1_duz9kyy	0	*	Well it is a major political scandal with multiple people already being charged for conspiracy against the United States.
t1_duzfa0a	0	*	Making mainstream media probably gives them a bit more of a chance, though, right? Maybe?  That said, given the current state of our State Department...
t1_dv05leb	1	*	A podcast I listened to just mentioned deepfakes and the pee tape in the same sentence and really made me sad about the whole situation. My gut tells me this is exactly what will happen.
t1_duzizbd	1	*	That was actually Hillary Clinton's plan. One of the prime reasons Putin feared her so much.
t1_duzcpnl	0	*	Second world (Russia and friends)  Although I think it's more correct to say Russia and the countries under its political influence
t1_duzjqjb	0	*	If that is the old definition, isn't he correct in describing the original purpose of the terms?
t1_duzinav	0	*	I wish bill gates would run. 
t1_duzjeh7	0	*	US: remember when the CIA had black sites in every country of the world? Or when we retained innocent guys for years in Guantanamo?
t1_duzq3rt	1	*	Your stats are for 2005. A 2014 update has Lebanon as #1 per capita and Belgium at #2. Canada is #4. Good points about the US not accepting refugees in the past though.
t1_duzryp8	0	*	There is a book in the Jack Ryan series by Tom Clancy dealing with this directly if I remember correctly. Excellent series, must read. 
t1_duzbs5u	0	*	You know, I'd never thought about the definition. Is there a legal way to distinguish those who choose to be public and those who don't?
t1_duzohj6	0	*	Just reminding you that a UN official just released a report stating that US poverty is the worst in the first world. 
t1_dv053pt	1	*	Because it helps shitty leaders hold and consolidate power.
t1_duz6q2n	0	*	Because we're still waiting for the Hangover Part 3 to be written, directed and released.
t1_duzdxo0	1	*	Because the people next door come over and beat the shit out of you sometimes.
t1_duzhto8	1	*	Lol. Right.
t1_dv240jl	0	*	You don't understand the meaning of the word scope.  The operation is large at very low cost, but the scope is the same.
t1_duviczy	0	*	But that airport.... do they hire directly from the Georgia State Prison?
t1_dsxu87z	0	*	My point is simple: gun control reduces gun crime. 
t1_dv0s1zh	0	*	In California, yes
t1_ds9u0nf	0	*	Yeah keep giving in to them, that will help.
t1_ds9iela	1	*	That's not very typical
t1_ds9i5l3	0	*	Should have gone with the Constitution class vessel. 
t1_ds9klot	0	*	So is Android. But if you're forced to unlock it thats moot.
t1_ds9siuw	1	*	Actually it's the 5th (self incrimination) that protects your password.
t1_ds9jqco	0	*	*In the context of the issue at hand*, meaning file storage, not service instantiation.
t1_ds9icqw	0	*	No no, it's not IN an environment, it's been towed BEYOND the environment.
t1_ds9qns7	1	*	...Wait.
t1_ds9nsre	0	*	It's moments like these...
t1_dt7e0ba	1	*	They can't deny a citizen entry but they might try to give you the run around. Pot tourism is going to be a thing for sure.
t1_ds9p6r4	0	*	The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.
t1_ds9jnvc	0	*	Im just pointing out this dude thinks only the US does this shit. Every country should do this to foreigners. He acts like its a one way street. 
t1_ds9q76z	0	*	Don't know what world you live in but boomers will be dead. No healthcare, they fucked themselces underground
t1_dseqhh1	1	*	Youll be like the guy from 1984.

t1_ds9mf71	0	*	Lol can you imagine how awkward it would be to have some border security dude looking through and laughing at all the dick picks in the phone 
t1_dsa5dsv	0	*	He's representative of every ugly, evil thing our country celebrates.
t1_ds9pnsk	1	*	most my experiences with Canadian customs have been long, drawn out and or extremely rude. generally same in the states, except when I pick younger hispanic or african american agents 
t1_ds9r3r5	1	*	You can use your left hand if you don't want to supply your right hand for fingerprinting....oh, left hand failed. Now I have to scan my right hand anyway.  Sneaky bastards get all your fingerprints. 
t1_ds9gaxc	0	*	Yeah wtf is that guy talking about? Thats outrageously extreme
t1_ds9qbzn	0	*	The notion that Canadians are nice and pleasant by default is definitely a misconception... but one that most of us are happy to accept... which only furthers the misconception.
t1_ds9fnbi	0	*	TrueCrypt is compromised and should not be used anymore.
t1_ds9sbdu	1	*	And they won't let you pass. They'll detain you (illegally) for a few hours until it's cleared up, then let you go.
t1_dsaee80	0	*	We dont want people like you in our country either. No country is perfect and I will pick America if given the choice again. So you sir, please kindly fuck off
t1_ds9rm05	1	*	And vice-versa, oddly.
t1_ds9lxbb	0	*	This is literally a post full of comments about how this happens crossing into Canada as well. They have even less rights at the border.
t1_dsabovk	0	*	Yeah, you're right, I can't. But that doesn't somehow make them all equally bad.     I'm sorry, did you have a point you were trying to make? 
t1_ds9deby	1	*	I agree.
t1_ds9qd6g	0	*	If you discount nature, it sure is.
t1_ds9l5ft	0	*	Goatse theme. Every icon goatse. Thousands of pictures of only goatse. This could work. 
t1_ds9p7dv	1	*	Oh I know ( xb0  xb0)
t1_ds9mzge	1	*	I recognize some of those words.
t1_ds9tdvv	1	*	You sound like you're 15 years old.
t1_ds9swng	0	*	I understand some people can't afford to.  Read the whole comment next time. 
t1_ds9pszj	0	*	Yup, law enforcement / border (US side, at least) whatever is just a big intimidation game. Oh, I can't legally MAKE you do this? Let me intimidate you into doing it. 
t1_ds9j0xs	1	*	They ~~got us in this mess~~ helped us get here to begin with.
t1_ds9itd3	0	*	It's certainly possible, but they generally reserve it for people that piss them off.
t1_ds9hf5x	0	*	Don't feel very done. I'm rather enjoying myself. 
t1_ds9kme5	1	*	It's even better than that: It's a computer you don't even know.
t1_ds9ld62	0	*	In the meantime implies things will get better and governments will roll back their power
t1_ds9dh3l	1	*	totes
t1_ds9kkvg	0	*	Damn, thought Canada was supposed to be wholesome.
t1_ds9sj45	0	*	But on the other hand it can be suspicious if all your devices are freshly installed - why would you reinstall/reset all your devices unless you have something to hide?
t1_ds9m20k	1	*	Good point.
t1_ds9jsbf	0	*	Thus they do not care or honor the US Constitution. Either they directly violate it, or they lie and violate it.
t1_ds9obue	1	*	Killing everyone is surprisingly easy compared to ruling everyone.
t1_ds9qmv0	0	*	Now cross out shared borders of named countries and compare available man power of France, Germany and Poland in close border areas to those in Canada and the US. 
t1_ds9oela	0	*	Yeah def... I don't like the thought of some creepy border guard being able to copy any pic he likes off my phone. Do they ever get checked so they don't do that?  (Probably not...)
t1_ds9mw0e	1	*	I mean yeah, if you slam your shit onto the ground they're probably not going to let you in.  Also you just ruined several hundred dollars of your own property so that's sort of a double bummer.
t1_ds9need	0	*	You are powerless as long as you allow yourself to be. Let yourself become Rosa Parks. What do you *really* have to lose? 
t1_ds9qbiy	1	*	maybe some ancient goatse will
t1_ds9po75	0	*	agreed. The don't treat the Canadians any better. miserable people. 
t1_ds9y52w	0	*	How many people on vacation have turned into spaghetti western? Less than .1% I bet. 
t1_ds9s54w	0	*	Your choice to make, friend. 
t1_ds9r3k2	0	*	...like the government doesn't do the kidnapping and torture thing.
t1_ds9xk5m	1	*	They won the elections. And that's the problem. People keep voting in Congressmen and Senators and presidents who agree with these policies.
t1_dsa0sd1	0	*	That's my point. A tourist wouldn't experience that.
t1_ds9r1x1	1	*	Almost anywhere else is better. Hell, China or Laos are better, they never check you at the border unless they have a specific suspicion. Land of the free, yeah, right.
t1_ds9ndml	0	*	Yeah, if by reason you mean is brown or didn't give me $100 then I agree. 
t1_ds9v0yj	1	*	I'm not saying anything until I speak to my lawyer. End communication.
t1_ds9r44c	0	*	You don't have any rights at the border.  Edit: instead of down voting me, why not leave a comment letting me know how this statement isn't true? 
t1_ds9srez	1	*	You get the government you vote for  Other states aren't as belligerent towards... Everybody.
t1_ds9pgjt	0	*	how about a pin that plays bukkake porn at full volume, and nothing else.
t1_ds9s4z6	1	*	I agree, still an interesting precedent though.
t1_ds9obcu	0	*	I was just being a smart arse anyways. Happy cake day, dude.
t1_ds9fcvk	1	*	If you're not defending it then I'm not sure what point you're trying to make that this exact same horrible thing happens for a different but no less awful fucking reason, and frequently so at that. 
t1_ds9n3h9	1	*	Not to worry, we are still flying half a constitution. 
t1_ds9j4rb	0	*	Can't tell if you're joking or not. Pls be joking   **edit not american am british. sending the queen brb**
t1_ds9jp9o	0	*	Oh, certainly - it's why we have courts, and not just officers.  An officer had a search warrant issued for my house on the basis of lies - the process is by no means perfect.
t1_ds9qk94	0	*	I have a Galaxy s8 I don't have that icon. Do you know how to activate guest mode? I can't seem to find it online. And nothing comes up when I search for guest in settings.

t1_ds9lr06	0	*	Its called a global entry - $100 saves you a lot of hassle and i hear if you have American Express it covers the fee
t1_ds9lk6k	0	*	Hmm good point. I believe as a US citizen they are obliged to let me through. 
t1_ds9qe1x	1	*	Uh, source?
t1_ds9knca	1	*	A veracrypt container in the cloud is pretty useless to the other guy, unless he has lots of time and a server farm. And a *really* suspicious reason to look at you that long and hard.

t1_dsa5h8s	1	*	Unfortunately most of us are just selfish and greedy fucks that would never unite together to put up a fight. We would just stand and watch and complain afterwards. 
t1_dsb7le8	1	*	Nah man you're just really stupid to compare the US' diversity to the European Union, it's not even remotely close to similar. You're as diverse as Canada.
t1_ds9ogoo	0	*	The PATRIOT act basically instituted an indefinite state of emergency giving the courts unlimited authority to bypass the Constitution and we gladly ate it up and then asked for seconds.

t1_ds9lykp	0	*	Won't they check your external drive as well? If they're going through all that trouble for data on your phone and laptop, surely it isn't much to go through your external data.
t1_ds9ipk5	0	*	Yeah, they also made some pretty impactful decisions in the desecration of the constitution and the American way of life. Just give it a few decades. 
t1_ds9skfx	0	*	White passing =\= white  Also black men and women arent rare in America, but that doesnt stop a whole bunch of despicable people from calling them slurs either

t1_ds9p4sp	0	*	Encryption is a wonderful thing.
t1_dsa195h	0	*	Do you think foreigners should have the right to vote in American elections too? There's gotta be a divide in rights. Civil rights should and are still unanimous though. 
t1_ds9t0ls	1	*	It's worth saying that if someone wants to claim to not use a social media but actually do make sure that your account can't be found by doing a Google or FB search.

t1_du4keee	0	*	And? Some towns have stop signs instead of street lights. Doesn't mean people should be aggressively against street lights. 
t1_du4k6bn	1	*	Obviously you don't.

t1_du3wwaf	1	*	the server room aircon was in full blast when they render the movie?
t1_du4f75w	1	*	There was no one doing it before bitcoin. And no one has been tested like bitcoin. Its easy to claim your coin is superior when you have 1/10000 the volume.

t1_du3kv1r	0	*	You have to exchange money to spend it in the vast majority of counties. That was my only point. Your paper dollars are no good in Ireland, England, France, Germany, China, Japan, etc.

t1_duor9hw	0	*	Comparing Clinton to felons in supermax is exactly the type of BS that Russian spread with their agitprop. Clinton wasn't a bad candidate, despite the narrative that has been pushed.

t1_dudkycs	1	*	Isn't stevia coke better?

t1_duajsws	0	*	I'm not moving somewhere with tigers, I'm a known taker of drugs that sometimes gets lost. Tigers eat dudes like me.
t1_dub8w05	0	*	Chode means penis. It is an English slang word for an intrusive cock. You chode.
t1_dub3l6r	1	*	Definitely is. Most of the art is left by the city so long as it doesn't bleed out into the financial district. It's got a huge cultural draw so it adds to tourism as well.
t1_dubaoet	0	*	Oh, was that a quote? *googles*  Ohhhhhhh!  I see, I missed it because I haven't seen *The Last Jedi*.  Sorry, I thought I'd just pissed you off.  =P

t1_du2u8cx	1	*	Right on. Polo shirts are hideous.
t1_du20jf3	0	*	I don't think I've ever heard of a public school that required uniforms. The only schools that have ever required uniforms in my area are private.
t1_du2gv4z	1	*	That was just depressing when they start talking about what they stole or gave up to be sapeurs. The Guinness ad with them was also disquieting, in a way I've never quite put into words. 
t1_du2tnti	0	*	Well not every man. I hate wearing suits, too constrictive 
t1_du2tnpt	0	*	Their diet in general cotains less red meat than western analogues I think. Also less wheat products since they consume a lot of rice as well
t1_du2k3fj	1	*	I wear cheap 20 dollar watches. They may not look fancy but they last a long time. 
t1_du2tf3b	1	*	I get more lifetime per dollar from thrift store clothes that cost 2-3 dollars and have little to no wear.
t1_du2sw5x	1	*	I've seen enough tests on jeans to know that price doesn't correlate with quality. Every brand would be different and expensive jeans can often wear faster than cheaper. I just buy what I like. 
t1_du2ljvl	1	*	I live in m iami. Thank God I have a little more formal option with short sleeves. I also play golf as well.
t1_du2n1yv	0	*	Levis are trash?  :(

t1_du2hgb2	0	*	Capri pants are popular literally everywhere but North America.
t1_du22h04	1	*	Yeah we never had uniforms at mine, either, though a standard uniform for girls was sweatpants and oversized sweatshirt lol. I think I was more of a jeans and black T-shirt kid, myself.

t1_dti0uh5	1	*	You said that they have not entered the market, they have.  European companies have entered the North American market as well just like American companies have entered the European market.
t1_dtgszhg	1	*	He'll get re-elected and will serve his second term without problems (for himself)
t1_dtfxgsj	1	*	I think the endgame is for whatever democrats regime inherits this mess to cover it all up in some proxi or direct war with Russia.
t1_dtht6of	0	*	A Canadian Trump-supporter? Troll.
t1_dtf1j5t	0	*	Answer the question Steven.
t1_dszkui8	0	*	Well it's a good thing the USA is itself owed several trillion. Not sure what it's at today but it used to be roughly one third of the current debt we owe.
t1_dtspidt	0	*	This myth keeps getting spouted. People even use it to defend Unite the Right'ers who literally chanted Jews will not replace us or Spencer who literally sieg heils. 
t1_dtsrou7	0	*	what government in their right mind would let people openly talk about overthrowing it
t1_dttaq1n	1	*	Dude... thank you so much! I'm not gonna go doing any shit, but it's good to know. Cheers!

t1_dtsqlzd	1	*	I agree.
t1_dtssq8z	0	*	Da comrad!
t1_dtsqs9p	1	*	Well how many of the hate speech arrests were because of that?  Remember, the father of a victim of a Pakistani pedophile ring was arrested because he criticized the police for not doing their job.

t1_dtspsx6	0	*	The fact that he went to court is still beyond fucked.....
t1_dtsso4a	0	*	Technically correct, but bigoted, xenophobic, racist is so tiring to say repeatedly. Easier to say Nazi.
t1_dttdfns	1	*	[Apply directly to the forehead!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_SwD7RveNE)

t1_dtssuq0	1	*	Man Putin's really obssessed with hillary. You guys know she's irrelevant, right? You can stop that hateful shame-filled mastrubation thing you've got going on any day now
t1_dtsq07z	1	*	That was a year ago. There are real issues now. Hilary is gone. Who cares.
t1_dtsspge	1	*	It's deflecting the topic of conversation from something shit Russia is doing, as usual.

t1_dtsqury	0	*	Free from government persecution, not from consequences. 
t1_dtsr7wx	0	*	So you agree you can't say lets go kill all the muslims in the UK either? BOTH countries have the same rules, it's a very simple concept

t1_dtsq2ac	0	*	He is absolutely free to say what he likes. 
t1_dtsljdp	0	*	> But the difference is that we have a working system of checks and balances that keeps us from being worse.  So it is a good thing that police waste their time on arrests that get thrown out?
t1_dtsr7nd	0	*	Freedom of speech is a part of the first amendment. 
t1_dtsq8e2	0	*	The term 'nazi' has changed a bit in modern use of the word. If one supports hitler and/or his ideas, I think it is acceptable to call the person a nazi.
t1_dtv3x03	1	*	Lone people kill people?  Sometimes.   Sometimes groups do, too.  You are talking nonsense.
t1_dtsxf32	1	*	Ok.

t1_dtn4gkc	1	*	The ease with which your circular bullshit can be swatted down does not mean that anyone had to stay up late thinking up responses.  It just means the bullshit is weak.

t1_dulre1y	0	*	If you say you killed some kids for christianity and its god, but dont even know jesus, its a bit fake, right?
t1_dulkgfs	0	*	> And that to me is way more worrying trend than muslim immigrants.  Ever wondered why?  If everything is so great. Ever wondered why the alt-right and nationalistic parties are growing?

t1_dsdtkhw	0	*	Sick burn, you've got a real quick wit!  Yes, I was curious if you are just an insufferable idiot or deliberately trolling. At this point I don't think it matters as it is clear you are a biiiaatttch

t1_dsamn0v	0	*	Good thing I never said you can take it apart like Legos. Perhaps you are the one that should check your grip on reality. 
t1_dsb12ws	0	*	Not really.. 10 years means another 600billion dead land animals and 20 trillion dead fish   Our planet is a dystopia for most of it's sentient inhabitants
t1_dsakqnh	1	*	Never too late to try. 
t1_dsaullt	1	*	Absolutely.
t1_dsaraf8	0	*	I feel like rich assholes would be fucking miserable on a mars outpost. All your resources would be rationed, Everything recycled, nothing can be wasted. Or they'd just fuck that up too.
t1_dsb491n	0	*	Sorry, replace Happy with optimistic, and not suffering and I also disbelieve that my children will suffer if that's the case. As well, this is heavy assumption, and you're kind of accepting fate. 
t1_dsb2hdh	1	*	Sparkles are pretty.
t1_dsbvtzx	1	*	>Alcibiades.  You... what? dude
t1_dsaxqri	0	*	Over the span of 100,000 years, maybe. Over 100 or even 1000 years? Forget it.
t1_dsapilx	1	*	Fair enough, but I disagree on society's adoption of post modernism.  Because I honestly don't see much difference between the so called post modernists and the modernists.  
t1_dsatnhz	1	*	That would use up all the oxygen inside the bubble.
t1_dsafv4v	0	*	Equal access to Healthcare for all citizens?  Quality public education (certainly once DeVoss has her way with it, though it's been declining for a long time )

t1_duv22zm	0	*	I thought she was skipping him to William or whoever is the oldest of Dianna's brood? Or was that just talk?
t1_duvf89v	0	*	Most people who live there, why do you care about an internal politics of an authoritarian country for that matter? The chinese don't want your western SJW snowflake democracy. 
t1_duxba2e	1	*	Only if you take the notions of certain states and groupes seriously. I am German myself and I've learned to ignore the white noise some people try to create.
t1_duyr7eg	1	*	Holy shit you are right
t1_duzlg28	1	*	And yet it's the most long lasting systems of government in the world. Republics have risen and fallen but kingdoms still exist.
t1_duxzxvq	1	*	There isn't?
t1_duxcwv7	0	*	Did the US government deliberately bury them as convicted war criminals, with the full knowledge that doing so would piss of the rest of the world? 
t1_duypoj0	1	*	Came here just to mention this. People are short sighted and dumb. 
t1_duy9n9n	1	*	Then you admit there US started the war. 
t1_duxal22	0	*	Very well said, there is little to no difference between the terrorist attacks of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and 9/11.
t1_duxcq4e	0	*	He expressed regret. He didn't apologise.
t1_duyt6tz	0	*	Ahh meth.... Another invention of a fucking Jap lol shoot yourself in the foot again... or nuke it?
t1_duxwikc	1	*	Do you think it would somehow cost less Japanese than that?  Take a look at the casualty ratios of the Pacific theatre or Europe even.   
t1_duxe7uv	0	*	How many Japanese people would've died in a Soviet or US invasion?

t1_dv22yy6	0	*	Its not subjective at all lol. Fire bombing campaigns lasted for months leveling entire cities like Dresden and Tokyo. Just look at the death tolls
t1_duy6985	1	*	He's learning and his [mind's blowing](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o8dFn5CXJlCV9ZEsg/giphy.gif). That's good. 
t1_dux5lcx	1	*	Nothing added that changed the argument. So you were wrong again.      Also, you now admit they acknowledged 'parts of it' and that was my point.      Care to go 0/3?
t1_duyszvk	0	*	Serious question: What's the lesson here?
t1_duyr0sr	0	*	>Are you saying every South Korean soldier that died in battle is a war criminal?  You are saying something like those far-right Japanese politicians who visited war shrine of WW2 said. 
t1_duxbqkr	0	*	Did you read my other comment? The other option was a full scale invasion, that would have killed even more Japanese.  Whereas their war crimes were exclusively unjustifiable. 
t1_dsfo5af	0	*	You forgot to include the term state-sanctioned doping program in there.
t1_dsffpbp	0	*	We live in a post-MADness world. 
t1_dsfa8i5	0	*	A draft? Really? Is that your excuse? From how tough you are talking you should be signing up right now. We got more problems then just Korea that needs soldiers, like fighting ISIS or the Taliban.
t1_dsfv0r5	0	*	I think its harder to catch North Korean athletes seriously doping because theyre cut off from the world. Might mean they can use stronger stuff.  ^(Thats my opinion, feel free to prove me wrong)

t1_dsfox3v	0	*	I mean, my world and everyone I know has a great life thanks to the boom Clinton created, and obama taking us out of the recession.

t1_dsfaxfq	0	*	Just like trump?
t1_dsffii6	0	*	It's a situation that just confuses everything up. Nobody wants it, except maybe North Korea, but we don't really know what they want at all.
t1_dsfvtbt	0	*	none of that is communism lol  those are all results of Stalinist-type government and economic systems, sure, but those are capitalist as fuck, not communist.
t1_dsfs23e	1	*	Well, not all Bananas.
t1_dsfft6z	0	*	You dont seem to comprehend what Im saying as nothing you said contradicts it. If they think that projection of irrational decision making might actually set Trump off...
t1_dsfjwiz	1	*	That's a pretty terrible argument, but I suppose so.  My pet peeve  there is when people barely shorten the word, like nite instead of night.  Why bother?
t1_dsfohfb	1	*	Yeah, it'll just takes a couple of bridges on I5 to cripple this state. 
t1_dsfdp3j	0	*	...have been to the moon :p
t1_dsfngn2	0	*	I was posting the article i was referencing. You think everyone who left an upvote didnt read the paragraph before the link? Congratulations, you're an idiot
t1_dsfjsmg	1	*	Man, don't just hoover up all the points for yourself!
t1_dsfgf4v	0	*	That's why everyone ignored North Korea. No one wants a way with China involved. But Trump needs something to boost his poll numbers
t1_dsfmz44	1	*	Hmm maybe the thing I read said were only referring to nuclear powers as allies then. 
t1_dsft18b	1	*	Very interesting. 
t1_dshaesp	1	*	Oh...well two years ago...  But sure...Trump's communication with the head of NK...yea that's the same as a Kardashian sex tape.
t1_dsff1oh	1	*	Not really. Just something I have seen people mention a lot on posts like these.
t1_dsfjoqm	0	*	I mean Reagan called the USSR an evil empire. And then almost started WW3 over what is essentially a joke outtake of a radio address. 
t1_dsfgw3s	1	*	Ling long ting tong. Ping pong. Yah I can see it too.
t1_dsfeinv	1	*	It looks that way if that's what you want to see.
t1_dsfj1qt	0	*	Armored rugby, American Football, American Rugby, Helmet Rugby, Handegg etc.  In europe football will always refer to soccer, unless we prefix it with 'american'. 
t1_dsfh4hv	0	*	The leak? Lol. If you actually read the article, you'd see there was no leak. There were no quotes from anyone in the Whitehouse. 
t1_dsfszb2	0	*	What does VSG stand for in this context? 
t1_dsfubxo	0	*	Im not. Im just pointing out the actual facts and coincidences, because the original guy didnt.
t1_dsfgces	0	*	You can actually cite answers given in AMAs in some research journals. 
t1_dsflqsd	0	*	Lol NK held the US by the balls? You crazy...
t1_dsfr3kb	0	*	What he said is true though. 
t1_dsfnjwl	0	*	Heard a lot of shit things about Cuba.
t1_dsfmzqf	1	*	yeah, i mean could as having the will or wanting to start one v/s the will to try to avoid it as much as possible 
t1_dsfkst2	0	*	There is none, just that NK is now trying to be diplomatic instead of so crazy... for now.
t1_dsfif66	0	*	Pacman was originally going to be called Puck Man due to his puck like features, but then changed because they feared the outcome of vandals.
t1_dsfiym6	1	*	No Kim did a new years speech which he said they should have talks
t1_dsfnmt7	0	*	The Whitehouse is seriously considering a tactical strike as we speak. McMaster of all people, is pushing this. They are hoping this will dissuade North Korea. I've never seen such delusion. 
t1_dsfgtdk	0	*	yep, I completely agree, though, today's weapons are much more destructive, so I don't know how secure the world is
t1_dsfe5mw	1	*	I sense a pattern...
t1_dsff2tj	1	*	IIRC they don't officially call themselves an ally of the DPRK but it might be out of date information. I do believe that they violate trading sanctions on North Korea and ship oil and stuff there. 
t1_dsfp76f	1	*	I never said that, that's also stupid
t1_dsfxyj5	1	*	Have you seen lift ticket prices?
t1_dsfnlvy	1	*	This is an athletic event? I thought we were still in the gulags...
t1_dsfwr51	1	*	Yup, North Koreans tend to be fairly short, and short dudes have a huge advantage in powerlifting. Not to mention, they have no problem getting good food and equipment for their athletes.
t1_dsfhi86	1	*	It was a joke dude
t1_dsfmmpg	1	*	Nice story, tell it to readers digest!
t1_dsfl1ak	1	*	That sounds like something a synth would say.
t1_dsg4sxp	1	*	I was being sarcastic, I am stating that... oh you're messing with me, nice song
t1_dsfkp8l	1	*	I'm Swedish and everyone just called that Rugby when I was a kid. American football seems to just be a modified version of that anyways.
t1_dsgqe8p	0	*	I have a bombshell announcement to make. I'M NOT MATT. I'M...
t1_dsfqzy8	0	*	Proof?
t1_dsfq67e	1	*	Nice knowing you /u/CohoCharlie   U0001f3feU0001f622U0001f64fU0001f3fd
t1_dsfivln	1	*	He's running off 25 year old assumptions. The United States hasn't had a vested interest in that since the Soviet Union dissolved and China became the US's premier economic ally. 
t1_dsfeql9	0	*	There is nothing rational about a dictatorship. It's based around irrational self servitude. Feels like the world is being conditioned into accepting this new wave of crazy. 
t1_dsff1bp	0	*	Did you hear the one about King Kong going to Hong Kong to play ping pong with his ding dong?
t1_dsfm0w6	1	*	Isnt it easier if the majority keep calling it football and call the other thing american football? Not to mention one of the sports are actually played by kicking a **ball** with your **foot**
t1_dsfgzdr	1	*	Maybe, but NK will torture three generations. So they've set the bar pretty high.
t1_dsfissh	0	*	You have subscribed to Cyanide Gorilla Facts.  [Did you know Gorillas can breathe in space?] (https://twitter.com/zfcyanide/status/776123237629587456?lang=en)

t1_dsfdlmu	0	*	table football
t1_dsfnqj7	1	*	Trade relations. 
t1_dsfjbba	1	*	I think the key is that American football is rarely discussed outside the US. When it is discussed it is referred to as either American Football or Gridiron Football.  
t1_dsfxbsh	0	*	Meaning that North Korea **themselves** are allowing their own athletes to compete.
t1_dsfnn8m	1	*	When they spell it definately I get angry. At least defiantly is a real word.
t1_dsfzfpw	1	*	Thanks, mate! 
t1_dsgj5vx	0	*	Except that the aid meant for the people goes right to the top. No civilian sees that aid
t1_dsfvwts	1	*	as someone that does know what they're talking about, he's right. DPRK dropped any mention of socialism or communism from their official writings a while back ago.
t1_dsf54jy	0	*	Are you justifying it was right for Kim to executing him based on that? r/pyongyang must be leaking.
t1_dsfivsw	0	*	If you don't recognize the significance of that I don't know what to tell you buddy
t1_dsfuujr	0	*	And if you do like Trump you are a Nazi. 
t1_dsffjtb	0	*	That sounds rational. But what happens when you call the bluff? Do they strike forth with nuclear weapons, or become an even bigger laughing stock on the world stage?
t1_dsfn8k8	0	*	1776
t1_dsfg12o	0	*	I think that's right, yeah.
t1_dsfemhk	0	*	Trump looks at Kim's irrationality and says hold my grape juice.

t1_dsfq4gr	1	*	Wait, are you saying you ***DON'T*** get freaky with your Mickey D's? What kind of American are you? /s
t1_dsfds3o	1	*	There was an attempt...  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_Conversion_Act
t1_dsfis3x	1	*	Right, thats why I mentioned him. Its almost like democracy consistently gives us ineffective leaders. 
t1_dsff9pe	1	*	Look at other dictators that lost power. Of course he is gonna do anything he can to keep power. You don't just walk away from that. 
t1_dsg14u5	1	*	No they even invite defectors back after a certain time
t1_dsg4tbi	1	*	Exactly! /s
t1_dsftbz6	1	*	I like how its good for multiple countries to have WMD because it leads to nobody using them due to MAD. But if everyone has guns mutually assured destruction is all of a sudden not a valid argument.
t1_dsgiw1c	1	*	Haha I was just taking the piss because of your name. It was a good match, but that wicket does not look good for India. 
t1_dsfg8n4	0	*	Nice story, tell it to Readers Digest.
t1_dsfkzrs	0	*	Bulgogi will be had by all!
t1_dsfpmyk	1	*	Absolutely, but if you're athletes already aren't qualifying then you might be better off putting your eggs in one basket, at least in North Korea's situation. 
t1_dsfq8i8	1	*	Brutal things are done during every revolution (save, of course, the Velvet Revolution)
t1_dsfq2fe	0	*	Ah yes, I'm sure they're shivering in their boots with their new ICBM that can hit any city in the US.
t1_dsfhtqo	0	*	Lol Ok, you don't like his style, that's fine. Yet he gets results everyone wants and no one has was able to get through these mysterious, so-called other ways. What a complaint!
t1_dsfhon7	1	*	It's confusing for native speakers too.  See [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/7p72tt/north_korea_to_join_olympics_in_south_korea/dsf411c/) as an example.
t1_dsfvhrj	0	*	Would the US need military bases in Korea if NK wasnt a problem?
t1_dsfh9pm	0	*	...Should we tell him?
t1_dsfia91	0	*	Am Brazilian and uh ahem I cannot confirm nor deny that comment...
t1_dsfotxv	0	*	2 only applies to specific kinds of legal questions.  doesn't matter for labor violations or public opinion, for instance.
t1_dsfifa6	0	*	From my experience, Reddit cares more about personality than policy. 
t1_dsfvtin	1	*	And this is why Wikileaks is dangerous. 
t1_dsg4sqf	1	*	There was never any proof!
t1_dsfp7gt	0	*	Yeah, regardless of your political stance, it shouldn't be controversial to say Cuba is better than North Korea. 
t1_dsfq1ie	1	*	Playing is a very appropriate word in this case
t1_dsfi62d	0	*	Yeah China will go to war with US PLUS NATO over NoKo. People are deluded.
t1_dsfk486	1	*	I don't think so, Last time I went a lot of the locals had smart phones and access to the enternet. 
t1_dt7rass	0	*	My bad it was 2008 when it got down to 1.04... but it's not really relevant to the point I was making anyway. Bit of an odd thing to knitpick.
t1_dtc4bq7	1	*	I don't feel good at all now
t1_ds4ls9d	1	*	Sorry to hear that :( I've had to confront few to gtfo and stop literring our property and it always went smoothly. Maybe I don't live in as bad neighborhood as I originally thought. 
t1_ds5d08j	1	*	Holy cow, you could more than 40 bucks selling the car for scrap metal
t1_dt5pqom	1	*	Don't forget Americans.
t1_dt4wspf	1	*	Not to mention wolves are pack hunters, vs coyotes and bobcats which are usually solitary barring mom with pups/kits/
t1_dt4nhh7	0	*	They're actually often much worse - dogs are known to mass-kill animals whilst wolves are much more targeted. 
t1_dt4whs3	0	*	You understand the religion was focused on animal sacerfise for over a century? You couldn't be part of it without animal blood 
t1_dt4yzrd	1	*	Some Great Pyrrenies or Anatolian Shepherds could and would take on an entire wolf pack, and win 
t1_dt6lyt5	1	*	Maybe they weren't doing it to impress anybody.
t1_dt56a4j	1	*	Lol you can see which I take about more from my keyboard predictions
t1_dt55iir	1	*	Oh ok.
t1_dt4mlac	1	*	I guess that makes sense.  In my part of the US there isn't any real population of stray dogs so it just seems unusual to me.  Thanks for the reply.
t1_dt58ulr	1	*	Still a matter of caliber and shot placement.  They are tough they arent tanks.

t1_dt3063s	0	*	BUT it is Afghanistan this isnt some wartorn African country. The government does aid terrorists that fight against us and help create an unstable middle east

t1_dt2yulm	0	*	Rule of Acquisition is good for Bitcoin

t1_dt2tcj4	0	*	Ok dude. Enjoy your delusion. Close your eyes tight, and pray real hard, maybe god will make it all better. GTFO 
t1_dt3ya84	1	*	So you are saying that, in true teamwork fashion, no one is really to blame for the bombing.
t1_dt37pyl	0	*	It's inspired heavily by a poem called Ozymandias by Percy Bysshe Shelly.
t1_dt3a78g	1	*	A sequel to Watchmen ruining moore's work.  No surprise there.
t1_dt2lh5c	0	*	You are missing the point where the President is supposed to be a professional and have decorum and tact.
t1_dt3na7v	0	*	I'm not the one making claims without evidence. Anyone can state something as fact. Bob dole is the reason Russia's economy is in a recession. See how easy that is?
t1_dt2knkg	0	*	Again, some random Mexican isn't the president of the United States. The office demands dignity above and beyond some dude you heard in Mexico. Ffs.

t1_dt33ebz	1	*	Aside from featuring High School kids and giant robots (which describes probably 10% of all anime ever made), how?
t1_dt2wxih	0	*	rabid progressives?

t1_dt30wvi	0	*	Quick tangent question- I'm starting to read Doomsday but never read Rebirth.  Am I gonna get lost?  I've read Watchman a million times, but I'm not that up on the DC world beyond the basic dudes.
t1_dt30gmp	0	*	Imagine how many translators have been sent to the gulag because another president just didn't believe the translation...

t1_dt37bm1	0	*	Some mental gymnastics you got going. Only propoganda here is what youre trying to spin for your orangutan god.
t1_dt2rqxd	1	*	That's totally the thesis of my post.
t1_dt33iel	1	*	That's because it is, mostly.  Let's hop on top of Alan Moore's shoulders and scrawl out some inane continuance of a story that ended where it should have ended already.  Move the fuck on, you hacks!
t1_dt30bao	1	*	Just like 10 pounds of shit in a 5 pound bag
t1_dt320cx	0	*	Yeah I didn't even read Before Watchmen or Doomsday Clock. Watchmen will forever be a standalone story in my head-canon.

t1_dt31yd2	0	*	Fuck I don't remember this! Time to rewatch CG
t1_dt2zpcg	0	*	I dislike the guy but if the doctor selected by Obama says Trump's brain is in good condition, then what's to doubt?  You can have a healthy brain and still be a bad person that can't give speeches.
t1_dt2hjc7	0	*	I think calling her Pocahontas as opposed to just saying she lies about her heritage for political benefit is KINDA racist at least.
t1_dt2vdc5	0	*	Youre out of your gosh dang mind if you dont think thats a herpderp imitation. Pretty fucked to do that in a public sphere as a representative of US government.
t1_dt30g1m	0	*	= A reach  Hardly a reasonable critique.
t1_dt2vbgi	0	*	We are deep into an Information Age. There is no reason to not verify things. If you cant provide a source that can be independently verified, i am under no obligation to believe you.
t1_dt2ykcp	1	*	Why bother asking? You've already refused reality by saying it's not true that he's racist/ misogynist. Why pretend you're open to facing facts?
t1_dt58fd2	1	*	I actually think we agree about all of this
t1_dt3142p	1	*	Not if they're a masturbating bum holding a bus hostage. 
t1_dt39pg2	0	*	So basically you're saying it is just a number pulled from your gut that you aren't willing to back in any meaningful manner? Great point.
t1_dt3e8hv	1	*	Dude Hunter x Hunter is a great anime!
t1_dt3qfbe	0	*	Obama and Bush absolutely are responsible for leaving the bubble of power open for ISIS to grow to the point they are now. You intentially misrepresented me.
t1_dt31ajf	0	*	>The only one of in the video that occurred before that was the one where he imitated a regulator cringing, vs actually flailing his arms above his head and making fun of how he talks. 
t1_dt2jz8z	0	*	> She has admitted it is untrue.  Show me a source for this, because I can't find one anywhere. Same for the idea that she did anything beyond listing herself on a directory. 
t1_dt357ge	0	*	Okay, that link only mentions Trump and Durbin. Ill ask again: do you have a source for those 4 backing it?
t1_dt36wrh	0	*	Then you better be ready to call most journalists lazy. This kind of sourcing is common, and these reports are likely more true than not.
t1_dt32tz7	0	*	Was not the original released quite shorty if not at the same time? Well, of course, it was better click-wise to focus on the golden shower, while there were less juicy but more credible statements.

t1_dt35fpm	1	*	Ya it's stupid but whatever, people can copy and paste if they want to read
t1_dt31dbf	1	*	In that case it comes down to who's doing the reporting.   If some tabloid is citing a nameless source, I'd be skeptical. If NPR does it, I'll probably trust them.
t1_dt32pj2	0	*	You seem to spend a lot of time thinking about penises.
t1_dt33cym	0	*	Hahha you seem pretty mad about this bud, did Trump hurt your feelings,
t1_dt31x7t	0	*	Yeah but the president is the president, not a stand up comic. His job in this case was to go out there and make allies, not jokes at the expense of others. 
t1_dt31s1b	0	*	Wow, life must be difficult having Trump live in your head like this.
t1_dt329fc	0	*	Being a public figure does not mean that people necessarily leak private conversations to the media
t1_dt471nd	0	*	Public picked trump too. Doesn't mean that critical and moral questioning of fitness to office be suspended because public picked him
t1_dt3g7qz	1	*	This is not the time nor place Mr. Scott.

t1_dt3nw3w	0	*	I thought not.... Why are you so fearful of it? It is almost as if you have something to be afraid of.
t1_dt35tcw	1	*	Exactly, he would've done great. Trump only likes people who don't get captured, and he likes himself quite a lot.
t1_dt32bey	0	*	>They're making some recap movies first  Aw crap, please don't go the evangelion route of never actually finishing
t1_dt30044	1	*	Honest question, if he is not a racist, why does he still think the Central Park Five should be executed?
t1_dt31gy1	0	*	That's a good point. I think acting (in any capacity, including as a GM) is probably the only time it's not plain making fun of the accent. I just can't think of any other reasons. 
t1_dt44j0z	1	*	My country neither. Exact same nonsense, mildly watered down
t1_dt2y276	1	*	That's fair
t1_dt3thvt	1	*	I agree with you

t1_dtoeijk	1	*	Lol! Where did I  insinuate that? Celebrities tend to be out of touch and hypocritical.
t1_du5l5oi	1	*	I think you mean bias against *our criminals* 
t1_dtnkjqi	0	*	Ahh I thought it was up to the RNC if they wanted to allow him to run again. Learn something new every day. 
t1_dtnvxqa	0	*	Its almost as if the actions people take and the company they take matters. And you don't have to be a democrat to see that t_d is a cult of freaks.

t1_dtnumaj	1	*	Holy shit the reasonable rationale may just become the norm on Reddit again. 
t1_dtp1u2u	0	*	There's a difference between them letting you do it, like trump explicitly says, and you raping them like Harvey did.   Of course you can't distinguish between SAYING one thing and DOING one thing.
t1_ds4cy5o	0	*	I give you 6/10 on trolling. Would have been 8 but I get the feeling you're using it to hide that you have no real argument.

t1_dsa5n6v	0	*	True. Im ignorant to the level of knowledge of the plane schematics needed for initial licensure/hiring for this size of a plane. 
t1_dsaybsk	1	*	A 5 year old is able to drive a car too, but that doesn't mean they can follow all traffic laws, return it undamaged or handle an emergency in bad weather.

t1_dsxc5o0	0	*	> What are you even driving at?  Transparency.
t1_dsxlfc9	1	*	> Not according to Trump  Trump was wrong, from a legal sense. However, he's right to be suspicious since we all know the NSA lied to Congress about spying domestically when they weren't supposed to. 
t1_dsxu5u2	1	*	I thought we were all about transparency. 
t1_dsxfyin	0	*	Then why not support its release?
t1_dsx0wzm	0	*	Never mind the fact that the FBI probably knows how to do its fucking job.
t1_dsxo02s	0	*	All of the initial #ReleaseTheMemo tweets are from Congressmen, you can see it in the timeline yourself.

t1_dshgfh7	1	*	So you're saying we *should* take the accusation seriously?

t1_dsh3v7h	0	*	I wasn't trying to rebut anything, and all it took was looking at the first page of your comments to see that you post there. 
t1_dshods2	1	*	Unexpected, fucking made me lol.
t1_dsh1469	0	*	Is there any unbiased journalist you can direct me to? All the sources I know seem biased.

t1_dsh4p81	0	*	If he started selectively leaking on Republicans - we know this is not gonna happen, not now, not tomorrow, never.  So engaging in hypotheticals that border on impossibility is pointless.

t1_dsh5p06	0	*	Thats hilarious. Elect a moron as president and blame the russians and wikileaks for it.
t1_dsgxmc7	1	*	That's sadly unsurprising.  I think he probably has some tortured justification he tells himself about how he's not a Russian stooge, that he's playing them etc. It's sad really 
t1_dshd3c7	1	*	He cant publish information he doesnt posess. The 'argument' you're making is a retarded one.

t1_dsh5agu	1	*	You got the timeline wrong by a few years. 
t1_dsh1nsk	1	*	> why is it that when he had information to leak on Russia, he didnt do it?  Because he enjoys being not dead.
t1_dshcfvk	0	*	yes please link that I don't think that is true because I had heard they were having consensual sex and the issue was he didnt wear a condom
t1_dsidjec	1	*	Reported your comment as personal attack.
t1_dsc78e4	0	*	It's fucked up that the defense of Israel is that they're not white. Even if they were white, does that mean they don't deserve to live in peace?
t1_dtbttk2	1	*	Indeed... operating satellite dishes is illegal in many countries, precisely because the politicians there don't want you to access foreign content.
t1_dsonkah	0	*	Asking you to look up the definition of genocide, and to check whether the Palestinians qualify seems to you like a personal attack?

t1_duov63h	0	*	I research it every night when the sun goes down and the temp drops 30 degrees in a couple of hours. 5% more CO2 is not going to cause 45 degree temperature swings in the Arctic. Sorry.

t1_dusmp3o	0	*	There were no foreign powers goading them on, they decided to revolt themselves.  It was only after they realised the whole running a Government and army is kind of hard that they asked for help.
t1_dusikcs	1	*	But Trump did go back and call them out!  Yeah, after days and days and *days* of pressure, and even then only did so halfheartedly.

t1_du1wncv	0	*	Well, as I said, American nature is great. 
t1_du1r0wt	1	*	There are much more brutal and fundamentalist Christian majority countries than the US. And even if that weren't true putting America on the same level as SA is just silly
t1_du1xd8w	0	*	So he lied to the guy he was replacing and voters, not just the guy he replaced. Good to know.
t1_du1v0ga	1	*	Gotcha, true
t1_du2s53p	1	*	Eeeh, depends on the state. Also, the president is an old, overweight guy in bad shape...
t1_du1rsuw	0	*	For example. I've only  been to California for 8 total days over the past two years. If i said, The progressive laws are terrible, would it hold the same weight as the comment above mine?
t1_du1z57k	1	*	Holy shit you're ignorant. 
t1_du1twet	0	*	Most christians don't, in fact I'd say that *actually* following the teachings of christ would be the unchristian thing.
t1_du1ozk6	0	*	Not to nitpick, but it was Nixon who opened relations with China. 
t1_du1u9aa	1	*	> They are as much Christian as ISIL and the Taliban are Muslim.  So more than most christians/muslims?
t1_du21sq9	1	*	Fapfapfapfapfapfapfapfap
t1_du1uuo7	1	*	Or sowed any oats before they married and she was a virgin.
t1_du1s1hv	0	*	Tell me again how we conscripted gays into the Winter Olympics, and the great casualty rate they suffer while competing there. 
t1_du1fvea	0	*	What in South Korea was Pence protesting against? 
t1_du22j0j	0	*	Uhhhh no. What is wrong with folks like you?
t1_du238ab	0	*	So we just take context and meaning out of the equation and bend people's words to how we want it to sound? Again, people jump to the worst possible conclusions when it's someone they don't like.
t1_du1v7kb	0	*	Coming from someone who doesnt know the difference between then and than. U0001f923
t1_du25y7y	0	*	So it's more about the masculinity aesthetics and not exactly being gay?
t1_du520nb	0	*	Expecting the President to save your job may be dumb.  But the President intentionally misleading  those workers and the rest of the country is simple dishonesty.  
t1_du1x22g	1	*	Then why do you continue to use improper terminology?
t1_du1t1hf	0	*	It happens in literally every fucking civilization that has ever and will ever fucking be. It's part of the human condition, get your fucking ideological bullshit out of here.  
t1_du1sq7n	0	*	>IT'S CURRENT YEAR REEEEEEEEEEE  The Olympics should stand for athleticism and sportsmanship. Keep you politics away from sports.   
t1_du29wal	0	*	I'll make this real clear.   You complained that gay people tell you you're gay.   Yet you want to be able to engage in sexually suggestive physical touching in front of others. 
t1_du1h0rw	1	*	Lol youre too lazy to google the shit yourself, and when someone is nice enough to do it for your brain dead ass, you barely read a few paragraphs before dismissing it. Glorious
t1_du1uq5a	1	*	Care to elaborate?   Multiple other comments suggest Pence inherited a rather healthy economy from Daniels.  
t1_du1jdh2	0	*	They certainly aren't sending their brightest today.
t1_du26ah6	1	*	> He feels intimidated around muscular men so he offers BJs?!  Who doesn't? :)
t1_du1t4q0	0	*	That's much worse. So thanks
t1_du1oj17	0	*	South America would like a word.
t1_du24dvo	0	*	I give up. 
t1_du2p8aj	1	*	Who are those Christians then? My experience with orthodox Christians is the same as UnderAStormySky's.
t1_du1o4de	0	*	I think Carter would have had a second term if not for Ted Kennedy's primary challenge.
t1_du1oq2f	0	*	Actually they were released at the end of Reagan's 20 minute Inaugural speech after being sworn in.
t1_du1qhf9	1	*	They'll definitely round something out for you.
t1_du1sznc	1	*	None. It says Thou shalt not covet but no punishment is specifically mentioned. Why do you ask? 
t1_du1eomp	0	*	> why do you defend the left which find white males to be abominations  evidence? You are hysterical and very hateful toward the left. You need to check your emotions before getting so worked up
t1_du1s572	1	*	Ah, how wonderful it must be to be this ignorant
t1_du1pl3n	1	*	https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2015/06/01/lgbtq-questioning-queer-meaning/26925563/  Now go apologize to the guy you called stupid for (correctly) answering a question.
t1_du1nx8s	0	*	not a bad resume, imho  i just remember him as the only living president i've never had a problem with!
t1_dvxo9jh	0	*	your shitty comment and opinion is a facade
t1_du1iajw	0	*	I'm not gonna give my sources anymore because people won't believe me anyway
t1_du35vej	1	*	Oh god, Im glad you made it out alive. Gary is not a place to fuck with.
t1_du1u7rw	1	*	so 100%
t1_du1q7ap	0	*	On a state level, sure, but on a national level though the electoral college favors low population rural states at the expense of the high population states that contain some of our biggest cities. 
t1_du1rjdu	1	*	Ty bby
t1_du1y6a5	1	*	This is the worst. :,-(
t1_du1s6c0	1	*	Whaaat? LIES. SLANDER. Those foreign workers whose passports and documents we stole *love* working for us. Youre fake news. Fake news, I say!
t1_du1p9s7	0	*	took me a minute to realize you meant a *place*. for a second i thought you were just singling out some asshole named Gary. XD
t1_du1r7bj	0	*	[Actually it's proven science that homophobes are more likely to be gay](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/homophobes-might-be-hidden-homosexuals/)
t1_du2em7x	0	*	For one, Pence supports policies that would make it easier to discriminate against them. That's an egregious example of not being left alone.
t1_du1vvx5	1	*	Any of them!!!!
t1_du23enw	1	*	And we don't.  Because we're not perfect, even though a lot of our citizens pretend we are.  
t1_du234em	1	*	Nope but he's following the laws of the Christian religion to the detail
t1_du1ryiy	0	*	> lack of complete sentences.  Bitch where?  The fact that you don't think it's real gives credence to the theory that you have it. Good job. 
t1_du1w7jx	1	*	Pot, meet kettle 
t1_du1rzod	1	*	you couldn't make this shit up
t1_du1w7hu	1	*	Solid argument.
t1_du1uvn4	0	*	Exactly. I didn't spell that put clearly or even get to the point properly, though, so I get the reaction. Brevity isn't my strong suit and I'm known for the occasional non sequitur as well...
t1_du1qs1u	1	*	It was also more likely that he'd win as a VP than as a governor. You pick your battles, even if you're set to lose both of them, and then sometimes you get lucky.
t1_du1uqvb	1	*	If the spouse was really faithful, the body has ways of shutting that whole thing down. 
t1_du21a0z	1	*	Have you considered a switch to spoons. Spoons require commitment, not the flu by night access to food forks allow. 
t1_du1ogvz	1	*	He's my fav and he's still going strong in good deeds.
t1_du1o9sn	1	*	Plus he legalized homebrewing.  The American microbrew renaissance a generation later is thanks to him. 
t1_du1u8z4	0	*	nearly every christian living in a capitalist society is not following the teachings of christ.
t1_du1rx9z	0	*	I don't know if I can help you if you can't read
t1_du1moqq	0	*	No, OP says Pence is feuding with LGBT.  Can you have a feud with someone who doesn't know they are in a feud?
t1_du267lp	1	*	Once you go yak...
t1_du2abki	1	*	Sadly, you are correct. The Olympics have not been the place to be out and proud in the past for the fear of a judge's scorn. Hopefully, those days can be over soon. 
t1_du1td35	1	*	Between the Senate, gerrymandering and Electoral College, they absolutely do.
t1_du1r6ih	0	*	Imagine him judging a male bodybuilder competition.
t1_du1t94w	1	*	Yeah people basically just mean Bloomington when they say that. Even South Bend is a shithole.
t1_du2638l	1	*	Im just scared that someone thinks being called out for groping someone means they were being insulted.  
t1_du1t7yf	1	*	Finland.
t1_du23v4q	0	*	I would hope that's not something that can be achieved in one year. I get the impression that he would if he could, though. 
t1_dtbgk3i	1	*	And my legs ;)
t1_dsbsmyb	0	*	Ok? All that shows is that there is no conclusive evidence one way or another lol, just as I originally stated. Hopefully you learned something today. 
t1_dsc2vf4	0	*	Ya this same thing applies to Canadian sales of alcohol and tobacco products. I don't use them but I see that as a fair price because of the costs they put on the health system.
t1_dsc64hc	0	*	https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/diet-soda-and-dementia-what-you-need-to-know/
t1_dsceqs1	0	*	It seems to me that this tax is intended to target soda and the like.  Bringing up things like that feels like a red herring.
t1_dtmhj8s	1	*	What does this have to do with anything? The root of this thread is a guy saying a 10 billion sale would cause this. This is not true, since we have 10 billion sales every single day.
t1_ds3ioer	0	*	Step outside dude. You need to chill. 
t1_ds3vnk4	0	*	Deer hunting is legal here, deer ticks don't require deer. 
t1_ds4csgj	1	*	On the brightside, pipes be freezing so my uncle and I are getting service calls left and right. Pays to be a plumber.
t1_ds4cw66	0	*	It's like driving with your balls stuck between your thighs.
t1_ds3wn7e	0	*	something being cost effective is literally capitalism
t1_dv51byj	0	*	Why don't you?
t1_dv5pwvj	0	*	Please do. You people are European anyway.
t1_dv7u26o	0	*	Like I said, watch and learn.  There is no source that proves future events.
t1_dv54f5v	1	*	What? God I love democracy
t1_dv4teaw	0	*	If they are licensing and modifying something I think its disingenuous to claim they didn't do anything. 
t1_dv65oan	1	*	Wouldn't make much of a difference to us I think
t1_dv656fk	0	*	> Because you don't understand economics  I have an economics degree...
t1_dv5nk66	1	*	No escape from reality...
t1_dv4th3l	0	*	Life would be so much better with 50% less economy and a nuclear-armed Muslim Caliphate. 
t1_dv6afar	0	*	What industries are those?
t1_dv5qixm	0	*	Atleast pull them into the common market. This would actually give the canadians a viable alternative to their US export dominated economy?
t1_dv5wnyp	1	*	Doesn't matter. Vauxhall keeps cutting jobs, and has pretty much been a rebadged german opel for almost half a century, but people like that are too dumb to understand how the world really works.  
t1_dv5mdpq	1	*	The President isn't up for election in 2018, the House and Senate are. If Trump doesn't stop they would likely add more tariffs on goods from marginal states like they did last time. 
t1_dv6hz40	1	*	No. The rules are quite clear, they would have to into Eurovision first. 
t1_dv4xryk	0	*	Yup. I'm great at essay writing. I can do that. I'm also okay at stats,  but I think you should do that part. Wonder how fast the peer review process will take for something as important as this?
t1_dv5qjpe	0	*	That list is composed of used cars, not new cars, most of which are 10+ years old and can carry high repair costs. Got any for new cars?
t1_dv592le	1	*	Hm...  my mistake.  I thought I read it was from Orange County, hence the OC.    But I might just be going crazy again.
t1_dv63vkh	1	*	Still waiting on his reply,  I see...
t1_dv65lag	0	*	U/turfmonster just got wrecked.
t1_dv7t9yf	0	*	No it's not.
t1_dv5olg9	0	*	That's not what I said at all.  An economic long term cycle vs a president who has been in office for a year.  Not sure how you made that correlation.
t1_dv54sij	1	*	I know the Focus in particular suffers from a lot of reliability issues in the US due to the transmission and electrical systems. 
t1_dstpolq	1	*	One could say speaking out is breaking the law in whatever country it is and it would be the same thing.
t1_ducyja2	1	*	She's a Killer Queen, you might say.
t1_ducpdci	0	*	Very true, so by that definition the whole world is free. Theres just consequences if you do anything.
t1_ducghr2	0	*	You say bleed the Soviets like that excuses toppling a government and destabilizing a region which is still reeling some 50 years later.
t1_dud23nl	0	*	Literally every country is hypocritical if you go far back enough so there is little point to it. If we try to say only the innocent can make accusations nothing is gonna get done.
t1_ducmqml	1	*	We have a problem with not keeping our hands to ourselves. We can constructively criticize ourselves...
t1_du774nl	0	*	yeah, i get that. but at what rates exactly have these files been downloaded, how do we know these rates and why exactly couldn't they have been downloaded over the internet?
t1_du7scqb	1	*	This doesn't add up in the slightest. It's a really, really bad defense of a theory that has little to no merit. 
t1_du7egkb	1	*	As best as I can tell your article doesn't support your claim that she recanted anything.  Were you just hoping nobody would read it and you could pretend you knew what you were talking about?
t1_du8o6eo	0	*	Why are you trying so hard? it's not like most people on worldnews are American voters.
t1_du89dbu	0	*	Some hard evidence would be nice.
t1_du7a9sl	0	*	He did that. He lived in the UK completely free for years after the leaks. They didnt go after him until he did something else. 
t1_du751w5	0	*	Ah I see, so he 100% had documents on Trump that he did not release?  Was this proven in some way?
t1_du7wu4y	0	*	> refused to publish information in summer of 2016.  The information could not be verified, so they didn't release.  >Remember in 2009 when they claimed Steve Jobs died of AIDS?  That was debunked.
t1_du75fy5	0	*	And kept trying to give advice to the Trump campaign.
t1_du6sg8z	0	*	What rights are you talking about?
t1_du8ikxe	0	*	No it wouldn't.
t1_du83nb4	0	*	Ok let's expand the scope beyond the law. There is still absolutely no argument for why extradition from Sweden is easier than from the UK.
t1_du75h2y	0	*	As someone who defends Wikileaks, will you choose to answer either question I proposed? I mean, if they are simply a neutral transparency outfit that should be an easy answer. 
t1_du6vfx3	0	*	So?  Breaking the law is still breaking the law.
t1_du7cvat	0	*	He walked around London completely free for almost an entire year while he was fighting the extradition...  Why didn't CIA or any other shadowy organisation take him then? 
t1_du76r8c	1	*	A half gallon of milk and a dozen eggs.    Also if you trade one pair of brand new adidas you get rent for 6 months.  Trade in eastern europe is mostly transacted with farm goods and adidas.
t1_du6tg6o	0	*	fair enough.  Any idea why Sweden won't interview him over skype like it does with other cases all the time?
t1_du773g7	1	*	>Obviously someone said she did or else we wouldn't be discussing it, genius.  Oh, that makes it all perfectly alright then.
t1_du7susq	0	*	Generally they go after the one who calls all the shots. 
t1_du8d2t6	1	*	> I have more than just this.  Why haven't you posted it then?  And where's the evidence you have that the DNC files weren't hacked like you said they were earlier?
t1_du8aswi	1	*	Yea you not thinking they lived up to the hype is not an inaccuracy. An inaccuracy is in the actual documents and there hasnt been one. 
t1_du8wpz3	1	*	You mean the zero of them? Everyone votes counted. People didnt vote for Bernie because they didnt want him. 
t1_du82jj7	1	*	Yes, that happened once and it was a huge scandal in Sweden. After that happening the risk of it happening again probably went down since a lot of people learned the lesson.
t1_du7k1bq	0	*	> So it can only be legitimate if it had made Hillary look good and Russia look bad?  Nice strawman
t1_du71lka	0	*	Who said it then? Random people on reddit?
t1_du88dwk	1	*	How exactly? I have not heard a single convincing argument as to how extradition to Sweden makes extradition to the US easier. Hell as far as I can tell it makes it harder.
t1_du7ytsv	0	*	That's all irrelevant, the charges were bogus, holy fuck. FALLACY. Frrrphphhhhhgghwrwbwbwbbbb. Aah! Really dude? Really? 
t1_du71gkp	0	*	It was a posted as my response about a legal defence...
t1_du82d74	1	*	They are paid to present his case in as good light as possible, not to present any kind of objective truth. It's fine listening to their arguments but not to take them at face value.
t1_du76yfh	1	*	Exactly!
t1_du739z1	1	*	Not all criminals are important enough to claim political asylum and get it, though. You are advocating that those who claim political asylum be turned over. 
t1_du78k0u	1	*	Were you meant to reply to me here? This seems... irrelevant? Like I was thinking about the Vietnam War.
t1_dsvo3xd	0	*	gut feeling is about the level of trust to put into an official chinese source, yes.
t1_dswxegk	1	*	Can't find anything in the mainland about it :(
t1_dsvi0uv	0	*	The US isn't the best country in the world for reporter freedom, but it's much better than China. PROC has some of the least free press in the world.
t1_dswuhbv	0	*	Please answer: Could a Transgender convicted fellon run for office in the higher people's congress? Or a black person? Or a pro-democracy candidate?
t1_dsx52b3	1	*	Don't bother; he's just posting the same shit all over this thread regardless of relevancy.
t1_dsvrodf	0	*	what's your threshold of proof to accept that the CCP is tracking uighur's movements to this degree? mind you, it's not exactly easy to do real journalism in xinjiang.
t1_dsw4xtc	0	*	I mean have you read the bloody harvest reports? About organ harvesting its like Russia and the Ukraine even though we may not be able to concretely price we know for damn sure that they did 
t1_dsvrwrn	0	*	hardly whataboutism, you're making explicit claims about western journalism vs eastern journalism
t1_dswjio0	1	*	Well no pre modern empires were 
t1_dtyabrw	1	*	It's not the same as Quebec. 
t1_dtxww9f	0	*	If you didn't understand the main idea of their comment, you should read it again. Your comment that they didn't properly express their idea makes you look ignorant.
t1_dtz9kue	0	*	It's a good job intelligence isn't hereditary then eh!  
t1_dtytj1u	0	*	ugh, that is such a cynical, misguided view...
t1_dtyi0u0	0	*	Not crazy left, and not crazy right... sounds like Hillary Clinton. 
t1_dtzaaw8	1	*	We should tolerate their intolerance!
t1_dtyocy9	1	*	Not really, one of them was talking about *specifically the terminology* and the other was talking about common-law vs. having an official ceremony/license.
t1_dtxysmo	0	*	> Also, you have no right to an inheritance if they have no will.  That's a pretty big one, considering how many otherwise responsible adults (cough me cough) haven't drafted a will.
t1_dty8lwz	0	*	Depending on which evangelicals you speak with, they might not consider catholics Christian, as well. 
t1_dtyn7w5	0	*	I'm using the downvote button because you're a typical naive, smug Vancouver asshole, not just because I disagree.
t1_dtxwr05	0	*	I'm in class right now, but I'll give it a look later.
t1_dtyo21s	0	*	Then why didn't your math game work when there where basically no atheists? If you think life is that simple then you've never read a history book
t1_dur74hz	0	*	That's not Swedish....
t1_dutb9vp	0	*	Online clicks/unique ip's are very problematic in counting. Increasingly newspapers themselves are moving away from that business model. 
t1_dsl77hk	1	*	hahaha ok
t1_dskra4m	1	*	\>anyone who does not agree with me is a shill
t1_dslyedi	0	*	It won't, China likes to use force to get what they want and they have plenty of force to use, but don't act like the Tibetans asked for it
t1_dskz1eq	0	*	Maybe when they pave over all of Tibet and have its citizens sucking down Starbucks and speaking Mandarin, the citizens will stop protesting and clinging to their cultural identity. 
t1_dsmdz3l	0	*	Tibetans born in China are Chinese citizens, Tibet is a Chinese province. Your statement doesn't make any sense 
t1_dsky9sj	0	*	The French in 1778?
t1_dskz3i1	0	*	And? That doesn't make it illegitimate just because the USSR aided the PRC?
t1_dslyaps	0	*	It sure doesn't. No idea why people are downvoting
t1_dskq444	0	*	So...you were wrong then?
t1_dsm7ayv	1	*	Have fun suffocating
t1_dsl941h	0	*	You're aware we're in a thread about China right?
t1_dsm05to	0	*	It's not a decision if there's only one legal option
t1_dsmduu8	1	*	Ikr, how dare China bans slave economy in Tibet, that's part of their culture! This reminds me the shameful western governments who doesn't even give the Muslims a choice to practice Sharia law.
t1_dsmhs7s	0	*	Well your dick is not big enough to do that
t1_dsks0fe	0	*	Its ok to be wrong. Its a good lesson in learning the facts before essentially spewing bullshit. Or you can take Reddit too personally and seriously and make people cringe.
t1_dsl2e4j	0	*	Well of your response is who cares, then I guess it isn't that big of a deal for a hotel website to list it as it's own country? 
t1_dsl8bbq	0	*	Are you unable to read? Demographics of Tibet. Still waiting.
t1_dsl10yh	0	*	So you're denying that there is competition between states? 
t1_dslyojs	0	*	Haha. One look at your comment history tells me all I need to know about why you're pro-China. That's all you ever really care about in terms of news isn't it? A chance to defend China?
t1_dsl4a7c	0	*	Now try and go apply the same level of nuanced understanding of the whole Tibet thing.
t1_dslfybp	0	*	I don't think most American's are remorseful for the shitty parts of history of this nation. Stop holding other countries to higher standards.
t1_ds9bmeq	0	*	I'm not hip hop hooray for homeless. I'm just for treating them humanely.
t1_ds9x329	0	*	So you're saying get rid of weed and you solve homelessness? That's insane.
t1_dsa2523	0	*	Plenty of people have beaten addiction.  When people say cant they are pushing the belief that the person is helpless.  We should be empowering people, not telling them they cant do things.  
t1_ds9siqt	0	*	I've lived in a couple of places with large numbers of homeless. I feel more sympathy for them and their position than I do annoyance that they're around me.  Maybe you're just a really bad person?
t1_dsa2wgq	0	*	Perhaps but Windsor is walkable from slough, they choose to not take the shelter offered to them
t1_dslfntw	0	*	Dude, youre so full of it. If someone said, Its Trumps money, youd say, Wheres your proof? Stop inventing facts. Thats what T_D does.  Your arguments are bad and you should feel bad. 
t1_dt8p2mo	1	*	yeah personally i just don't see it as particularly unsavory but i do understand that the average person abhors age discrepancy in adult relationships.
t1_dt0bmm9	1	*	Half this post doesn't even make sense. Hypercomputers? This sounds like someone referring to DNA as information straight out of creationism babble.
t1_dt085pk	1	*	I didn't observe you writing this post this so you didn't write it.
t1_dt0axwy	0	*	I get it, and i dont consider it wrong, but it easily gives out the wrong idea.
t1_dt097vu	1	*	Using big words doesnt make you smart. 
t1_dtpw884	0	*	No but they have very close DNA to Bulgarians. Propably because so called Macedonians are Bulgarians in denial
t1_dtpvhyy	0	*	Greek macedonians you mean? then propably but still there was a lot of crossbreeding in that area with turks/slavs.
t1_dshs1j9	0	*	Do you even know how supply and demand works?
t1_dtma45a	0	*	For one thing i don't want to be in your make believe club, and you don't know anything about my best interest.
t1_dtmzu0i	0	*	They bar terrorists, not based on skin color, like say the orange shitstain does in the US, or Brexiters want to do in the UK.
t1_dsri5pp	1	*	You're absolutely right. Not sure what my perspective was now. 
t1_ds8r1h4	1	*	Thanks! How dystopic is it that I misspelled that word?
t1_dv34f11	1	*	You should be more grateful.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pax_Americana
t1_dsdbtp6	0	*	Israel invaded Palestine and stole most of their land. What do you expect them to do?
t1_dsdzvm0	1	*	You weren't even in the country when that happened!  Which it didn't!
t1_dsdt8o0	0	*	Probably shouldn't generalize.  I feel lots Americans are usually the first the criticize themselves. I feel like a huge amount of American media is just shitting on other Americans. 
t1_dsd7s3u	0	*	I'd say yes, propaganda plays a huge role. But also nostalgia and the feeling of past defeat and injustice still not being fixed.   So Israel's human rights abuses are still a factor. 
t1_dseuv0q	1	*	Before the creation of Israel, the middle-east was owned by western colonial nations, post-ww1. 
t1_dsfl3wz	0	*	They're literally mass murdering each other to this day, you can't pretend their conflict is a myth.
t1_dse63gk	1	*	It doesn't at first, but consider the large scope of history and politics. 
t1_dsea7jv	0	*	Israel couldn't conquer Gaza because it was too expensive for them, it's a siege now that the settlers were expelled and the West Bank is still being colonized. 
t1_dseykci	1	*	Yeah, what's our excuse? 
t1_dsevbt9	1	*	Thats the only viable solution. 
t1_dsfux9o	0	*	Sorry, but I don't understand your point. It effectively blocked all ships into and out of Eilat, and was also in violation of earlier agreements.
t1_dseobby	1	*	Settlements are extremely relevant to Palestinians, those in Gaza and otherwise. 
t1_dsf5x6s	1	*	Alright, imagine Iraq - only this time ISIS wins - even if temporarily.
t1_du32xmt	0	*	Despite some key events, the last hundred years have been the most peaceful and prosperous time in human history. By big margins. 
t1_dsvux76	1	*	I'm an Englishman, I have to know this sort of thing. Irritating the French is a national pastime.
t1_dtakvku	1	*	thank you
t1_dv5xge1	1	*	ohh, i didn't know about it.  New things learnt from reddit comment section.
t1_dv2z2yc	0	*	You called him a lefty in a way that makes you a righty, but when someone calls you this you get upset, this kind of shows it fits.
t1_dss64ix	1	*	Yeah you have zero political or ideological prejudices lol.  
t1_ds6of76	0	*	The subject of the conversation, yes. I never claimed it was accurate. I have doubts about Wolff.  But I don't get why you said I'm sure you think that. It makes no sense.
t1_dt2q8iz	0	*	What's your point
t1_dt72u8k	1	*	> Too bad I actually been there and seen the slaves.  As I said, I am not denying there is some slavery in Dubai, just like there is slavery in every major city.

t1_duvwku7	1	*	India just signed a massive natural gas import contract. 
t1_dtqd2f6	0	*	Blood and soil, eh? Is it really that hard to see how your ideals are exactly the same as the Nazis and Islamic terrorist groups? Or are you purposefully blind?
t1_du1srne	0	*	Funny, I grew up in a poor household and was taught that if you rely on anybody but yourself for your prosperity you'll never find any. ;)
t1_du2dh52	1	*	Very well said. The command-and-control/militaristic style of doing things is on its way out I believe but it's not gonna go down without a fight.
t1_du19ovu	1	*	>That's like if I say going to war isn't the same as having PTSD. Just because one causes the other, doesn't mean they're the same thing.  But no one said it is the same. 
t1_du1ggov	0	*	Seriously, people act like there is some cliff. Doctors diagnose it with fucking SIGECAPS. Theres not some blood test.
t1_du1xxgc	1	*	That's an incredibly ignorant thing to say.
t1_du1ipnr	1	*	Actually internet was anarchy until corporations hijacked it because it worked too well.
t1_du20cb8	0	*	Who said anything about killing them?
t1_dto3hcx	1	*	that's rape. don't let society tell you otherwise
t1_dtncw92	1	*	You're the only person here talking about conspiracies.
t1_dtnmg75	0	*	Cooperating fairly is not equality
t1_dtopdg2	0	*	I didn't downvote you, and no, there really is no way to discern that until either being raped no longer feels shameful or we have cameras everywhere. 
t1_dtnlat8	1	*	There's also not enough evidence in the articles about the FBI to claim that feminists are solely responsible for the change.
t1_dtmrm9p	0	*	God damn that's a lot of links.  Thanks, I'll try to read up on this later.
t1_dtmyrbr	0	*	Thanks, means a lot 
t1_dts9gg0	1	*	> China makes good cars today  Thats an accurate statement.  
t1_dtucn95	1	*	Thanks for your honesty. I would post another more accurate article but I couldn't find any other news outlet that reported this. 
t1_dt0w6cr	0	*	It's a wave year because they got one seat from republicans not voting for a credible child molester?  That's something. Sounds like you're in for a disappointment. 
t1_dt0w9pi	0	*	Talking about two different things? You should go back and read the comments more...

t1_dun32r6	0	*	All legions post-Caesar in Britain were domestically raised.
t1_dun15zm	0	*	France is bacon.
t1_dunilvl	0	*	Being that even language reconstruction going back 10 thousand years back is on earth quake level of shaky ground, claiming language variation from 200 thousand years ago is bullshit.
t1_dunlq5q	1	*	I don't disagree with you at all.  I was simply trying to advocate for assimilation.
t1_dunrmcs	0	*	Yes I am also concerned as to where this apologist is from. McCarthy sent me. 
t1_du3w8id	0	*	 For a few reasons, including the importance of the religion in nationalism (e.g. solidarity) and john Paul 2.
t1_dual5wy	0	*	I know it's all about experience, but people taking these unpaid internships are only telling the companies that they will be able to get free labor out of people desperate for work experience.
t1_duadw18	0	*	How about a bank.
t1_dudsqdg	0	*	The hijab isn't demanded by Islam. Nice try, guy. But sure, like a lot of Muslims living in oppressive countries I'd pretend to to believe in some imaginary God.

t1_dt6xw4f	0	*	Yeah - Tesla.  The level of stupidity in this thread is mind blowing.
t1_dt6ugmr	1	*	Even accounting for production, and electricity purely generated by fossil fuels, EVs still result in fewer life time emissions than ICEVs
t1_dt783zx	0	*	And? Thats what they need to do.  Why would one use a 5000 mile range ship for a 50 mile route?
t1_dt6m56d	0	*	Bearly, manufacturing the batteries for these things produces a crap load of carbon, the average car won't beat a electric vehicle in terms of carbon produced but a 60mpg ICE can.
t1_dt6xxje	1	*	Each container on a tanker is several tonne - just lift it off with a stevedore and crane.
t1_dulhug1	1	*	:)

t1_duczwbr	0	*	Ok, I was just trying to open this up for dialogue. What is the statute in the UK?
t1_dt5oa7l	1	*	> I described what most of them want.  Both OP and I are saying they only want it because it's a centuries-old abusive relationship that they cannot escape.

t1_dt5y4kr	0	*	You're working under the impression that the Russians had a crystal ball with which they could look into the future, apparently.
t1_dt69tq3	1	*	How about we all agree that the future of Russia would not be a happy one during WW1 and after?
t1_dsyi19i	0	*	fair enough but how fucking childish of the dems to use the funding of the government to get back at a grudge.
t1_dsyjtvs	1	*	Republican memories are so convenient and self serving. 
t1_dsyir8r	0	*	Democrats dnt oppose anything in the budget bill, they would only agree to passage if DACA was passed as well... how does immigration reform make sense in a budget bill?

t1_du05056	0	*	Thanks for the kind words. Next time Ill just think it through though. Totally allowed my own prejudices to get the better of me.
t1_dtdda1e	0	*	I'm saying China doesn't have freedom of speech.  What set the stage for modern China was the abandonment of Maoist policies and embracing western capital and foreign investment.
t1_dut19ow	0	*	And worse than almost all of the First World.
t1_dut4wd3	1	*	Taiwan didn't become an actual democracy until 30 years later.
t1_dut02v3	0	*	Yeah like that time Congress passed sanctions against a foreign country for meddling in our elections and Obama refused to enforce them ... oh wait 
t1_dut1c1v	1	*	I'm not sure differing views on history is a particularly unqiue quality. Even if you're all working off the same history book, everyone has his own interpretations.
t1_dut1c1m	1	*	I think it was a little bit of both. I'm a middle school teacher so jokes that get groans are better to me than ones that get laughs. 
t1_dut8uzj	0	*	There are tons of examples of the prime minister's own party derailing him.  Yes, prime ministers lead their parties, but they have nowhere as much control as a president has.
t1_dusww8n	0	*	Wow, I would have found it hilarious if I was in his place. Why do so many politicians enter the no fun allowed zone?
t1_dut0a9i	1	*	Sucks. Was a solid player.
t1_dutbil2	1	*	China is fundamentally different than Russia or the former Soviet Union anyhow. There are checks and balances in place, although less formalized than we see in the west.
t1_dut575z	1	*	Holy shit man he was talking about the fact that Chinese PUBG players go into NA servers so they can hack...  No need to bring up school shootings.

t1_dusznld	1	*	I have been learning of the history from a few different viewpoints.  Lots of revisionist history down here, and the infighting is real amongst states and religions and classes.
t1_dut04n0	0	*	Oh it's a good one
t1_dut3hdi	0	*	Then you don't get how ingrained this is to our American culture and values. If you think the military and law enforcement would be on the side of the tyrant, you know nothing.
t1_duu0yz9	0	*	Explain? He was the leader of the CCP, and as such all Chinese military units were beholden to him.
t1_dusyu8s	1	*	Damn everything about that is perfect

t1_dut2pk4	0	*	I don't know if biased towards is the right term, it's heavily anti-CCP since it's founded by Falun Gong folks who obviously don't get along with the CCP
t1_dutcz4r	0	*	if you only count the last 200 years maybe
t1_dut1rbh	1	*	I can think of one particular western liberal democracy that's mildly dangerous to folks who aren't educated, upper middle class, men, and/or white.
t1_duswvai	1	*	lol how can you take offence with that?
t1_dusz9jg	0	*	> Most of the GOP was rabidly anti-Trump in the primaries, and many of them still are. This just isn't true.  Maybe the GOP establishment, but the GOP voters were pro-Trump almost all the way.
t1_dut2zhv	1	*	An uncle who does not appreciate a good joke about himself is no good uncle.
t1_dut5nlb	0	*	Patronising. This is why we ended the liberal elitist globalist Europhilic control of our country.

t1_dut2gi7	1	*	Canada Lmosy has Prime Minister's for as long as they keep getting voted in, voted being the key and huge difference between long serving western leaders and stuff like this.
t1_dut650c	1	*	Exactly. Trump views the military as weak and he wants to improve the strength. Whether hes right or wrong, its clearly a way to exert soft power instead of preparing for a specific conflict.
t1_dut3lcm	1	*	Or they'll just ignore it. Who is going to hold any of them accountable?
t1_duuc5ya	1	*	Yes that's enough evidence. So? That's not what my point was.

t1_dut15v4	0	*	Well, the system is hybrid. and its a relatively new system. It became an elected office in 1965 and with the office of the prime minister considerably strengthen in the 1958 reform.

t1_dusz96i	0	*	Putin steals a lot more than just money from oil. He launders money from just about every Russian industry to line his pockets to preserve his power.

t1_dutxahz	1	*	This is Disney's response today  https://i.redditmedia.com/oFexoui0W223j8r5rpboeoGQh7uh_xTi6ObXLBfOEAE.jpg?w=643&s=85b6e461ebe92bbf6a59a815ed34eca5
t1_dutfx31	1	*	Oh, ok. Your country has a very interesting history!
t1_duszf5e	0	*	I do. What's a right-wing communist?
t1_dutfonq	0	*	Yeh no shit, that's my point. I'm saying America would prefer if they were the only ones with nukes, which would be incredibly dangerous.
t1_dv4id30	1	*	The ottoman empires provinces in Europe actually still did in 1907, I completely forgot about them
t1_dv2ethn	0	*	They don't own you so you're not their slave
t1_dvbbesb	1	*	Your point? Nobody was killed there.
t1_dv2a205	1	*	A bit of an over simplistic view of things.

t1_dsk7zor	0	*	Thanks for responding - I'm not trying to start a fight (too early) I'm just genuinely curious - what brainwashing? Who was telling you to vote remain?
t1_dskbgqq	1	*	Dude. Stuff! Chill.
t1_dsko2hp	1	*	Get me 3 tires, 12 Campbell's soup cans, and a pet rock. I'm gonna make this work.

t1_dskiy3o	0	*	Not as cool as the pub in the basement of the Canadian High Commission across the square... (although it's long gone now that we sold the place)
t1_dskb2r6	0	*	The first comment is about why Obama couldn't be invited, not Trump. Secret Service is still in charge of protecting Obama. 
t1_dskbivo	0	*	TBF, how many building do you know (that aren't castles) that have moats?
t1_dskcnp9	0	*	Anti corruption is basically communism.  Understood.
t1_dsk6xdw	1	*	Interesting how there's no trump supporters here at all except when this book is mentioned. Which one of the little shitholes posted about it? Or are you just a bot? Either way, sad.
t1_dskkfal	1	*	Well yeah, they're a pair of complete wankers, I just thought it was quite funny.   >Trump elected President.  We're fucked.
t1_dsk5rvx	1	*	Don't you put that fucking evil on us
t1_dsk8rrp	0	*	I meant he's going to say and make up whatever he wants, and his people will believe it. So details like this aren't important to him or the people that listen to him.
t1_dskj4r4	1	*	no idea
t1_dsk65x0	0	*	The average trump supporter actually fits the profile of the ignorant trash that put Nazis in power and all the trump supporters I've met are seriously racist as fuck. 
t1_dskkail	1	*	Why, the freedom to enjoy your apathy and evade your civic duty, of course.   Took me a while to realize it, but when people don't vote they get *exactly* what they deserve. Reap what you sow.
t1_dskgmgq	0	*	American in America here. While I certainly have friends who are Trump supporters, they sure have been quiet lately. 
t1_dskk5za	0	*	Well he already said vaccines cause autism so you never know what idea hell throw out there next.

t1_dskpzp2	1	*	Possibly a Scottish term, taking bets basically, but as the bookie.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bookmaker_(gambling)
t1_dsltvf3	1	*	It's more like making money off of a historical investment and paying a quarter of it back as tax every year. It's an investment that keeps on ticking, just like the Queen herself
t1_dskjfol	1	*	A huge majority of us hate him. Just be glad you don't have to live here surrounded by his delusional followers.
t1_dsk7gpv	0	*	How does censorship of certain ideas promote critical thought? Isnt that the opposite? Wouldnt critical thought mean considering every viewpoint to determine what you believe in?
t1_dsk8zzj	0	*	By far the majority of Californians voted for Hillary. Trump is not welcome in California and has not visited the state since taking office. It's fine for you to visit San Diego. 
t1_dskawi6	0	*	Bobert too.
t1_dsk8c22	0	*	Or the president of American Samoa.
t1_dsk9nnu	1	*	Yes? Unless you wanna guess what the other half wants, their voices are irrelevant because they're not using them.
t1_dsk7w3n	0	*	That was your nickname in high school. 
t1_dsk9r40	1	*	I wasn't at all. She should have removed the visit. She pretty much did sweet FA.. plz don't be mean, you should apologise. No, I hate your country. Okay, look forward to seeing you!
t1_dsk3i1f	0	*	What does that mean?  
t1_dsk6x7x	0	*	On the left and right. 
t1_dskbq1r	1	*	Yeah makes sense. I used to be a gov official at an Embassy so have seen a bit of that. Its really quite horrifying, but apparently there is a bit of prestige working in Embassies!
t1_dsktlg7	1	*	Not just that, but a stable genius with all the best words and ideas. A crowd of admirers flock around him to bask in his bigly radiance 
t1_dskua7u	1	*	The Empire taught many a heathen how to queue but at the end of days, they reverted to their baser natures.
t1_dsptjxb	1	*	Well said, a well aimed Royal tut is enough to bring down even the most fervent jihadist!
t1_dsk63ti	0	*	Your average member of the Nazi party wasn't Hitler... just people who ate up his message about why foreigners and non-conformers were ruining their country and turned a blind eye when necessary. 
t1_dsk71m8	0	*	As a liberal in the heart of rural red Nowhere, America, it baffles me seeing people who are otherwise intelligent defend this degenerate.
t1_dsk6wwm	0	*	It's an indirect democracy. It's not completely democratic, but it isn't not democratic either.
t1_dskkg6q	0	*	Do you think it's a good thing that foreign invaders made the indigenous people of North America a minority? 
t1_dskdeg9	0	*	Complex progression example? Perferabpy with a fallic reference
t1_dsk5n07	0	*	What? He literally has recordings of hundreds of conversations that he cites in the book.  Please kindly go back to your land of alternative facts and quit trolling.

t1_dskj6d7	1	*	owft haha, there's so much potential to roast him with that name
t1_dsk8f6c	0	*	There's honestly nothing Americans can do about Trump right now? Jesus, he's not king of the United States. He's really not untouchable.
t1_dsk5w0d	0	*	Not every trump supporter is a Nazi. Some just want to put Nazis in charge of the country
t1_dsk7hcp	0	*	Thatcher was pretty close

t1_dskogll	1	*	Thanks.  I was kind of kidding, but I always like learning stuff.
t1_dsk9mgk	0	*	As a local San Diegan...please feel free to visit! San Diego is just as laid-back and nice as it's always been!
t1_dskgikp	1	*	I get the same thing in Taiwan, I always get asked how he got elected.
t1_dsk80ha	1	*	Doesn't matter - his supporters will blindly believe whatever he tells them, facts be damned.
t1_dslbhw1	0	*	It may be a redefinition for you since you were equivocating the two. If all words meant the same, then we would only have one word. We have more than one, though. Patriotism =\ nationalism. 
t1_dskcdps	0	*	Not if someone you despise called you it.
t1_dsk8j88	0	*	Massively wrong, you guys have major elections this year

t1_dsklw60	0	*	Keep telling yourself that, buddy.
t1_dskbb2l	1	*	They're really not 
t1_dsk3dc4	0	*	There's a difference between criticism and insulting. Surely the fact that donald trump is the president shows how ineffective insults have been?
t1_dsk894q	1	*	Maybe in the sense that he's pointing at the footprints and claiming that he was the one that made them all while saying Obama was walking the other way
t1_dsk41kg	0	*	Why?
t1_dsk7ssa	0	*	Now tell us about how democratic the UN is.

t1_dskuvg6	1	*	Ahh the WC Johnson... Good Ole toilet dick. 
t1_dsk8y1x	0	*	Yeah, but you dont amputate people from the elbow to the wrist, and leave the hand magically connected to the elbow, do you?
t1_dsk5tkg	0	*	He literally said that he has recordings. We can verify this on our own. If everyone is going to know you're lying, what's even the point of opening your mouth? 
t1_dsknvup	0	*	I'm not sure if you noticed this, but the election is over now. Hillary isn't relevant anymore. Now let's focus on our neo-nazi president. 
t1_dsk8ec9	0	*	Yeah, you can see the rage grow. If its true, it hurts. Don't say things you can't back up if you don't want to look like a fool.

t1_dskjs85	0	*	You must not know many Trumpsters.  I envy you.
t1_dsk8xvl	0	*	Hanlon's razor says never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.  Trump defies that by being equal parts malicious and stupid.
t1_dskgoy4	0	*	After a couple of hundred years it's probably not much of him.
t1_dska04j	1	*	I mean - can you argue that he **is** being President?
t1_dsl1fz1	1	*	It has literally nothing to do with Obama.   Why do you guys always jump to him?  He's not president anymore lol
t1_dsk7oqr	1	*	>Saying Obama is at fault because he sold the old embassy after the new one was planned is just stupid .  Yeah, no disagreement there.
t1_dskl907	1	*	There's no idiocy in asking questions, only in assuming answers instead.  Guy above me wrote it already, it is indeed United States of America :)  Sjedinjene Amerike Drave.

t1_dsk755i	0	*	Dunk'd on him

t1_dsk2gym	0	*	Maybe people didn't feel comfortable with either candidate? Ever thought of that? Doesn't make them less of an American. That civil duty bullshit is a fucking pipe dream.
t1_dskfbr7	1	*	Yeah, I clearly didn't think that through. Trying to tell someone exactly where you are on a motorway is kinda difficult without a reference point. Thanks!
t1_dskbjbc	1	*	I'm supprised Trump doesn't want to go there then, seems right up his ally
t1_dsk5mvt	1	*	He never said anything of the sort. What he **did** say was that he recorded everything.   The fucking lying is so pervasive with you ignorant trolls. 
t1_dskie3o	0	*	Trebuchets?
t1_dsk8yux	1	*	I must be misremembering. I thought he did it as part of a game/challenge-thing? Am I remembering it wrong?
t1_dskas1d	0	*	Nope. China is easily more powerful. Only need a certain number of nukes to be as equally world ending, but they also have great economic power. 
t1_dslog35	0	*	About how many horsepower do you get out of your bog-standard roo?
t1_dskge48	0	*	Crazy isn't it? I lived in a flat above a shop in Battersea in the late 90s and it was an absolute shit heap.

t1_dsk5etv	1	*	Ignore him, he's a T_D poster
t1_dsk64i0	1	*	Oh yeah because nothing says proof quite like he said he didn't do it.  Do people like you try to be this dumb? There's no other way I can fathom you actually believing this straight up stupidity. 
t1_dskgnzz	1	*	New one will too.  It *is* a US embassy after all.  They're always well protected

t1_dski2bh	0	*	So do you have any problem with your president getting endorsed by and openly defending Nazis?
t1_dsk9k3u	1	*	No. I enjoyed that mean tweet but this was much better.

t1_dska5bn	1	*	Hopefully, the dems will learn of this tactic and use it when time comes to their advantage. Not to spew bullshit, but to grow a fucking spine and talk straight without being afraid to offend someone.
t1_dskgbhg	0	*	I've read literally hundreds of nicely upvoted comments about the issue just today actually.  Keep telling me that pointing out pure hypocrisy is a strawman and whataboutism though.

t1_dtc1649	0	*	Yep I agree. Its a nasty dirty equation. It seems like villainy is critical for our survival and advancement as a species. Good can come from evil. I wish we could come up with a better way though.

t1_dtc71zb	0	*	Early Iraq would allow it RoE-wise, but it seems like a terrible waste of ammo.  Blap the guy with coax or .50 if you are worried about him and you aren't taking sniper fire.

t1_dtc3gee	1	*	you must be referring to 14sierra and not djfl

t1_dtbwoxu	1	*	Ya I thought he was a Hitler loving atheist. An murdered a bunch of Christians hanging out peaceful at church. 
t1_dtc2yz6	1	*	Thanks. This helps a little. I am in tears over this shit. These poor fucking people, murdered for no gain whatsoever. I am just going to go hug my girl tightly now. 
t1_dtby3pi	1	*	I got tired of how much spinning every news story seemed too have. Many times I'd read the article and the comments on reddit wouldn't match up with.
t1_dtbzati	1	*	If humans can be evil and cruel doesnt the term dehumanize lose all purpose and meaning? IE hey you, youre a human and fully deserving of nothing good because of your acts.  U0001f937ufe0f

t1_dtbtl1p	0	*	For the most part aside from natural disasters and disease we created those situations though. 
t1_dtbt414	0	*	Failing to act to save someone's life is not the same as killing them. By that metric, the US is responsible for all deaths on the Earth.
t1_dtcqjtp	0	*	Whats wrong with that. Do you think if america left everyone would sing folk tunes?

t1_dtby8j0	0	*	Adding fragmentation to a bomb isn't exactly a new or revolutionary concept that no one knows of. Does basic knowledge of military ordnance qualify you for the list these days...?
t1_dtc89m9	0	*	From being on this site way more than I should. 
t1_dtd6cku	0	*	Muhammad most certainly was a historical figure, as far as Moses goes he was most likely at least semi legendary but there likely was an equivalent figure who wrote much of the Old Testament.
t1_dtd9f32	1	*	No, I don't think that. What's your point? 
t1_dtc0075	0	*	Everybody is on the list by default.
t1_dtbvuj2	1	*	I think i missed the part where it's ok to use an innocent child to kill people, soldier or not.
t1_dtdfb76	1	*	Depends on the area. But anything from Belgium would be Belgian. Not Belgium as that is the actual country. We don't say France bread, or England tea.

t1_dtbwlds	0	*	Chill the fuck out 
t1_dtbyeif	1	*	He's just describing shrapnel, it's how most hand grenades work. 
t1_dtbwmk9	0	*	No. Look up your history. Bactria was in Afghanistan as was the Kushan empire. Afghanistan flourished during these times and was not a graveyard of empires. Please do some basic research.
t1_dtd2z8v	0	*	We didn't seem to mind when we needed that dictator to mass murderer Iranians for us. 
t1_dtbzlam	0	*	Damned if you do, damned if you dont.  Dont do it = you dont care about them because they are different. Do it = get bashed for one reason or another.

t1_dtbuyfb	1	*	Ahhh my apologies. I meant Iraq War
t1_dtc50bh	1	*	Yup, ingroup-outgroup behavior seems to be at work pretty much constantly. And it's practically never mentioned compared to other biases.
t1_dtc32nj	0	*	During a time of peace a nation should just not have a military? And when someone declares war on them how do you propose obtaining a trained military out of thin air?
t1_dtcgwev	0	*	TIL the treatment of non-Salafi muslims under their control wasnt literally a textbook definition of terror!
t1_dtcodv0	1	*	That's what it was, thanks!
t1_dtbzk4g	1	*	My thoughts and prayers go out to me on this sad day that I am sad.
t1_dtbz5l8	0	*	And even that Civil engineers are usually held to base repairs. The construction of FOBs arent even built by them afaik. Civil engineers tend to do A/C units, plumbing, etc..

t1_dtc3i5f	1	*	Yes
t1_dtbt4ch	0	*	Who is attacking him?  I'm saying he's a charming and dapper statesman!  Also, he's really good at making sure done bombs don't mothball.  
t1_dtc3tmy	0	*	> Right, and when he was committing a genocide against Iranians he had the full support of the US.  Was Bush Jr the president when that was happening?
t1_dtbz0fs	0	*	> gun violence  Keep in mind that those statistics include suicides, which account for the majority of gun deaths. *Obviously* that doesn't make it ok, but it skews the perspective a bit. 
t1_dtbz5of	0	*	Everyone that doesn't agree with me is a Russian Bot.  Still waiting for my Putin checks.
t1_dtby0e3	1	*	And surprisingly T_D was the primary sub breaking the news. I'm not a fan in general of them, but that was good of them.
t1_dtc0f2z	0	*	I wasn't referring to this incident in particular, just to the old myth that terrorists and freedom fighters are the same thing from different view points
t1_dtcjmad	1	*	The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.          Of course the definition of liberty, patriot and tyrant are not commonly agreed upon.  
t1_dtbywo5	0	*	India is also a country with tens of millions (hundreds of millions?) of English-speaking people though
t1_dtbxrgg	0	*	But that's like saying insulting a stranger in broad daylight and then finishing with Dont worry, In just an asshole and then behaving like no one should have an opinion about that.
t1_dtc2b7l	0	*	But the information and technology we have access to prior to a 100 years makes the difference.
t1_dtbv7ee	0	*	We're not going into their country rounding them up by religion, race, and disability and sending them to deathcamps so I'd say it's a bit different.   Edit: and we didn't throw the first punch. 
t1_dtcxslp	0	*	Wow you dont sound like a very nice person.
t1_dtbwh3v	0	*	Nobody is forced to use children as weapons, don't pretend they didn't choose to.
t1_dtbv8lw	1	*	They didn't say it was fine, they just defined the difference between insurgency and terrorism.
t1_dtcnr28	0	*	Call me old fashioned but I believe using children to wage your war for you is wrong regardless of the circumstances.
t1_dtc2tvc	1	*	haha, okay.  So in a time of need you what, call around for helpers?  Like a said, I don't agree with every decision made but mercenaries? You can keep your hyperbole. 
t1_dtc0zpm	0	*	Whatever helps you sleep at night bud
t1_dtbwdk7	1	*	That's because someone blowing their head off in a school parking lot qualifies as a school shooting. 
t1_dtbw5xn	0	*	wtf did chavez do

t1_dtc0ikn	1	*	>it's easier to feel sympathy for people you can relate to.  what the hell do you think tribalism is, exactly, if not that?

t1_dtcoevf	1	*	We both are for reading it.
t1_dtbt41h	0	*	...so when are *y'all* invading Saudi Arabia in response?
t1_dtburvw	1	*	That excuses nothing, and is disgusting of you to aplogize for
t1_dtczkrg	1	*	No it doesn't but tell me now it retroactively validates the UK's forced occupation of another country?
t1_dtbvalu	0	*	If both are morally unacceptable what's the point of one being a little less wrong?
t1_dtbzznn	0	*	Taking people out of a country doesnt prevent a Terrorist attack, if not then someone else. The problem needs to be fixed. 
t1_dtcgcq5	1	*	Wanting a theocratic state with no personal expression is by definition not freedom. They dont pretend to want freedom. They want control.
t1_dtc1drs	0	*	Actually, nobody really gives a shit. 
t1_dtc7ew1	0	*	No where. that's not what I said at all. 
t1_dtbu1mo	1	*	True, but to the loved ones of those who get bombed that makes little difference, especially as in neither case the perpetrator sees jail time.
t1_dtc4h2h	1	*	Them pesky Sumerians, lol :)
t1_dtdr5qz	0	*	Extremists who aren't religious is a straw man...   I didn't mean it to come across  pray=get bombed. I think you just took it a bit black and white. 
t1_dtbzoez	1	*	So its only okay to use kids in war if its against the right people? I disagree. But also, fuck nazis.
t1_dtc1v80	1	*	Bruh, you ever seen Half Baked?

t1_dtbz7o2	1	*	You can, yes. Except it seems that most people lack the ability to do this.
t1_dtc739d	0	*	I'm pretty sure what he said isn't correct, since none of the sentences in the bots comment have those words in them
t1_dteg11y	1	*	And what should we do differently to show that we value those lives? 
t1_dtbwzwf	1	*	Well then the republican approach must be move out of your shithole country.
t1_dtc99im	0	*	I know, but they had connections and were seen as a similar threat

t1_dtc3pty	0	*	Jesus' apostle St Peter was the first Pope. Nuff said. ;) 
t1_dtcbaot	0	*	I don't feel strongly about protecting al Qaeda or any terrorist outfit, but I also don't think US has any business invading and occupying other countries. Mind your own business. 
t1_dtc045l	1	*	I'm confused, Do you have a problem with the word or the concept behind it?
t1_dtc04z8	1	*	It's obvious this guy is probably in his 30s and lives to be edgy and trying to feel smarter than everyone else.
t1_dtd0vxm	1	*	If Adolf Hitler is your commander and chief, you're a Nazi.
t1_dtcy9jl	1	*	I honestly am not wrecked even if there's a mass death in my town. It's not like I have to mope to put thought into it.

t1_dugvsns	1	*	>I just gave back as you gave me. Except with more style.   Sure you did, pat yourself on the back bud.  Why did you link me to a BBC News article about plastics waste? You're a strange one.

t1_duf83q1	1	*	> However, she's functionally incompetent at basically every part of governing, and running a party that fucking hates people  Hmm. That explains why she and TheDonald get along so well.  
t1_duevqw2	1	*	As an actual Englander, we do also put 'eh' at the end of sentences. Nowhere near as common though and the inflection is very different.
t1_duexm43	1	*	How dare you. We eat no spotted dicks or wimbly whatsits.    We eat PORK, BEEF and CHICKEN raised at the peak of farmhouse torture freshness for maximum flavor!

t1_dtz12bu	0	*	Yeah, I'm not sure why people are complaining about it now lol
t1_dtyzs5k	1	*	Time. Space. Gender. There are no rules anymore. 
t1_dtyz32y	1	*	Which is a hell of a lot better than small time shit. I have used most of these and can say none are good.

t1_dtz37v3	0	*	Ok. Got it. You and are talking about the same subject with two different perspectives.   Your nationalism is showing. 
t1_dtz3uo9	0	*	I wonder if Facebook counts mobile apps with FB login as daily users. It's nearly the only reason I'm keeping it now.

t1_dtz49kv	0	*	Yeah, seemed like a pretty quick turnaround is all. Plus, it seemed to happen a while after Bernie was basically over and done with.
t1_dtz61xu	1	*	I do love the good ol' fashioned plain aswell, but I usually always get a 10 pack for my 3 pups cuz they go nuts for them.

t1_dtz21qw	1	*	The dudes a terrible troll, just look at his posts in here. It's better to just move a long.
t1_dtyz6kz	1	*	Well drake may out rap America, but you guys are totally screwed if you try to fight our military. 
t1_dtyvw8x	0	*	Found Trudeaus Reddit account.
t1_dtzbm9v	0	*	10 pack? Goddamn metric system.
t1_du0zjm7	1	*	If what you say is true, it is indeed concerning. That slope is awfully slippery
t1_dtyuj91	0	*	Don't forget us Quebecois bringing our poutine :D
t1_du5mtwh	1	*	Guy's a troll sewing division. His post history is rife with calls for isolationism, violence, and he plays both sides.  I wish Reddit did a better job of weeding out these chaos sewers.
t1_dtyy47u	0	*	Accusing people of wrong-think isn't what America is about.
t1_dtzai7c	1	*	Do you *really* know it when you see it?  Are you sure?  The very nature of fake news and its insidiousness is the inability to perceive it.
t1_dtzquo8	0	*	Why do i need to post anything for you. It's everywhere go look it up you lazy shit.

t1_du0ql0f	0	*	I only know about the one tweet. How, exactly, did he make it a huge deal?
t1_dtz38x6	1	*	I get it. But that doesn't change the fact they are much more radical and extreme. Which was the original point. 
t1_dtzfpu2	1	*	After being explained that it was a joke I rolled on the floor laughing. I get it now
t1_dtz6w9w	1	*	Unfollow everyone? Then you just get notifications for the invites people send you and the chatter in those events
t1_dtyvf86	0	*	Lol call it what you want but pretty much anywhere on the internet where you can socialize is considered social networking by very definition 
t1_dtz57f0	0	*	Plane donuts? But seriously what's the deal with airline food?
t1_dtz3aoo	1	*	Wow you're very brave. Thanks for your heroism! o7
t1_dtz19el	1	*	Difference in talking Facebook the company/stock and Facebook the website. Long term the company looks fine but the website does not. 
t1_dtz8j5k	0	*	You know you can manually approve everything people tag you in so it doesn't show up unless you're ok with it?  You probably didn't know that which is why you're freaking the fuck out lol
t1_du0z5p9	0	*	No dude. Don't preach sensitivity. I'm fine. These are the points im presenting. Debate them directly. Not everything is subjective and you're being immensely subborn. You're not listening.
t1_dtz00m8	0	*	The fact that you can't pause or fast forward/rewind videos pisses me off more than anything else on IG. Like why is it even set up that way?!?!

t1_dtyzzx2	1	*	No, that was just the top of the list.  
t1_dtz6gix	0	*	He's saying the vast majority of people don't have those problems, which is true. Those issues are very real for some people, but not most.

t1_dtz8m71	0	*	>iMessage is all anybody really needs.    If you live in US. Outside it is a really dumb choice because it only works in one platform but apparently in US people only use iphones.
t1_dtzp0wk	1	*	You dont know for sure though, so maybe stating it as fact is a mistake
t1_dtzjdvr	0	*	You seem to do fine.
t1_dtz071j	0	*	Facebook is their biggest in terms of revenue, and the others are all mobile and easily replaced by the next cool thing. Facebook had the largest number of members and daily active users.
t1_dtz3i0r	1	*	I get glazed donuts and I get to die?? Sign me up
t1_dtz29wa	1	*	There's comments that rarely make it high up the thread calling for it, compare that with the *cough* articles posted to T_D
t1_dtz09gp	0	*	Older people spending more money doesn't mean Facebook doesn't care about losing a massive demographic. In Addition to the it factor that person mentioned.
t1_dtz2lvq	1	*	Lol, no you won't, [or you wouldn't be involved in T_D](https://www.reddit.com/r/AgainstHateSubreddits/top/?sort=top&t=month). 
t1_dtz8q2x	0	*	You bastard. Have you no pity for Zuckerburg?!
t1_dtzadfw	1	*	Sure; Facebook in China. That is never gonna happen. The russians and the chinese have got their own facebook. I would say that countries like india and co will get their own fb too over time.
t1_dtzd1wc	0	*	[This] (https://www.careerplanner.com/Career-Articles/Generations.cfm) will help you.

t1_dtz4c03	0	*	Thanks for your feedback Sophie.  
t1_dtz3ulu	0	*	I have no interest in talking about that shit hole.  Edit: Go radicalize some more murderers; it's the only thing you're good at. 
t1_dtzdijq	0	*	Yah, that's kinda my point ... you're not old enough to have seen much of anything that came before it tho, apparently. 
t1_du030pp	1	*	Also you're the ideal candidate so there's no need to do extensive interviewing.
t1_dtz06cs	1	*	Dunder Mifflin and sah-bray!
t1_dtyyj4y	0	*	I like the Ctrl Left term. I find it as scary of an evolution as the far right, also because it is done in a wholly different way: less obvious but as threatening to freedom ideals.
t1_dtyvlm6	1	*	You won the internet, how does it feel?
t1_dtz1nez	0	*	> Either you're against him or you're on the pieces of shit that support him.  Only a Sith deals in absolutes.
t1_dtzfoah	1	*	Canada too. Many get more than one social media network and stop posting as much on Facebook, but they've had their account up pretty much since elementary  and keep it for messenger.
t1_dtz22p6	0	*	Then 3rd parties would buy out the data and we're back at square 1
t1_du0d65j	0	*	Exactly. 
t1_dtzeikz	1	*	Thanks pal
t1_dtz0fkq	0	*	Yeah right, good luck avoiding all the moose. Those things are a lot bigger than you think. 
t1_dtzvclt	1	*	It's a popular genre for a reason. :/
t1_dtzg20d	0	*	To be fair, if trump ever did anything right it would be a lot easier to have a fair discussion. He's probably the most consistent president we have had/will have.
t1_dtz81zg	1	*	Exactly, even when I was using Facebook I found it easier to use messenger. I never understood why people got upset
t1_dtzaihu	1	*	I see a lot of people switching to Telegram and it makes me so happy!
t1_dtzd45b	1	*	Because they're fucking stupid, and aren't thinking how it can and will be used against them in the future.
t1_dtzatis	0	*	You are a typical shit posting Trump supporter. Learn how to communicate like an adult and how to construct logical arguments for things you disagree with. 
t1_dtz1g3r	0	*	The joke is that peoplekind sounds ridiculous. Literally no one has ever said peoplekind, there's an established gender neutral form (humankind). 
t1_dtz9u81	0	*	Sorry, wrong number honey! I confused you for my other wife
t1_dtzb59c	1	*	I can understand that. I grew up with IRC though, so I actually prefer the Discord style because it is so similar.
t1_dtzerwq	1	*	Why weren't they laughing then? That same crowd were applauding the crazy woman in the beginning until she couldn't get to a point .
t1_dtz3yna	0	*	I agree with everything you're saying, but aren't their numbers like better and better year after year?
t1_dtzbq2o	1	*	AOL online. Sorry you can't leave our walled garden. But why would you want or need to. Everything we want you to have is right here
t1_dtyyn1q	0	*	Because moderators here don't get paid, only the admins do. 
t1_dtz3ce4	1	*	Actually [Brazilian ownership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3G_Capital) 3G international is majority owner of Burger King and Tim Hortons. Also, last year they bought Popeyes chicken. And heinz...
t1_dtyw8y0	1	*	No worries. It's just hard to compare the development of our national identities. Both are born out of war but at different times and for different reasons leading to different ideas of a nation. 
t1_du05ic7	1	*	I've heard of it, but I wasn't aware of its popularity until we put our Book Club events on it.
t1_dtzi84a	0	*	You can't argue with someone who doesn't trust reputable sources.
t1_dtz2unr	1	*	the just changed it again in January. 
t1_dtz7ixr	1	*	What? I'm sorry, but I don't get what you mean?
t1_dtz33ak	0	*	You mean that thing that Trump is being investigated for?
t1_dtz5csw	0	*	I dunno man, a few days ago he changed the national anthem's lyrics to be more gender inclusive
t1_dtzi1yj	0	*	Dead serious.
t1_dtz38ol	0	*	I sometimes use Facebook to login to other apps (tinder, gymapp etc) dose that count as a login?
t1_dtz8zxi	1	*	At some point those teens will be adults and will have disposable incomes. 
t1_dtz44nd	1	*	They haven't gone full Niantic and counted all the bot accounts ...  so there's that to look forward to.
t1_dtz2ra7	0	*	It God damn well should be. That's the problem. End of story. There is no real argument on this. Debating it shouldn't be a human right very specifically in the US is just sickening. 
t1_dtz27nz	1	*	Oh you mean the 2020 uprising when Facebook updated their algorithm which accidentally created a rogue AI that black mailed users who deleted the app? Nah bro thats a ways down the line.  
t1_dtz8ism	1	*	guess the mocking was too subtle for some
t1_dtz07xi	0	*	Is it as ridiculous as the other things he has said?   The budget will balance itself.  It is 2015!  I know quantum computing!
t1_dtyuidg	0	*	He could be lumped in with Mark Levin, at least. Extremely dishonest and manipulative drivel.
t1_dtz11gj	0	*	What's up your ass?
t1_dtzhv35	0	*	You don't know that, that's your interpretation of the video. Other interpretations are just as valid imo.
t1_dtzim9v	1	*	Me too =/
t1_dtzcbyx	0	*	Myspace was free and in terms of size, it was First.  See where it is now?
t1_dtz0ql7	0	*	idk i thought he was mocking the lady by trying to over PC someone who was already ridiculously PC
t1_dtzc5cy	0	*	Text? Don't those cost money? Just hit me up on LINE.
t1_dtyzoz9	1	*	Knees touching
t1_dtz5dc3	1	*	As long as people in my country stop talking about it I'm ok with that.
t1_dtz3gl1	0	*	Didn't you hear? Only trump is allowed to make jokes. All other politicians, even in other countries, are required to be 100% serious. It's in the bible I'm sure
t1_dtz1dds	1	*	Atleast 30 thousand of those are young girls who are wearing nothing in their profile pics who happen to live in my exact suburb and have two photos all up. And they all add me for some reason! 
t1_dtz8224	1	*	They own them but that doesn't mean that they could sustain them if Facebook went down
t1_dtz2owd	0	*	Because not everybody has Google accounts, just like how not everybody has Facebook.
t1_dtz1xj5	1	*	Trump gets weirdly sensitive about things and he freaks out and tries to fire people when they dont come across as loyal. I absolutely think he would try and censor things he didnt like. 
t1_du778t3	1	*	The Bible doesn't convey any land rights
t1_dtqbij6	0	*	No one pays 130k for a vehicle to become an uber driver.  
t1_dsxp5ti	1	*	Just repeated your preaching, but whatever. I lost interest
t1_du5eh5n	0	*	You didn't say anything about playing devil's advocate. Try being more clear my dude. 
t1_duttcco	1	*	Even though he's right about many things, since he doesn't hold the same opinion as me I'll disregard his statements. 
t1_duqtys6	1	*	Doh! Fixed it 
t1_duqm7oc	1	*	You are sick. Please i beg you get help for yourself. These thoughts are the same as those pushed by hitler..its actually sick. What the fuck. 
t1_duqr2u3	0	*	They Illegally wiretapped him and his campaign.
t1_duqta9g	1	*	The president can temporarily override the act, I wonder if he could be fooled into allowing himself to be arrested by the US Army.
t1_dur13uk	1	*	Some dudes really dig a strong jaw line.
t1_duqktgm	1	*	No problemo friend. I got too defensive anyways. 
t1_duqk3jb	1	*	Not sure why you emphasized ALL, because that's definitely not true
t1_duqlnr2	0	*	also, he gets a fee pass on the US dumping the switch to the metric system.  that one still gets me in the joules. 
t1_duqk7si	0	*	No no no no no! Trump is a disgrace and pig, but he has (yet) to start an illegal war and kill millions. Never forget how evil Bush/Cheney was/are. 
t1_duqgbpq	0	*	> dyson'd  hoovered?
t1_duqoaqr	0	*	Parsons can also be ongoing, or cover a period of time. Trump can say I pardon you for all contempt charges for the next ten years and bingo, youre off the hook.
t1_duqwsmz	0	*	It's because he's from California and campaign ads are known to cause cancer in the state of California so nobody watches them
t1_duqliiz	1	*	I can definitely agree to that
t1_duqwlhc	1	*	This thread was very enjoyable to read. Keep up the good work, lads.
t1_duqpz1i	1	*	Well played; I would lightly amend that my construction was greedily parsed; your analysis is spot on.
t1_duqnk1n	0	*	Important to note that this is all theoretical - SCOTUS has stated in dicta that accepting a pardon is an inherent admission of guilt, but afaik it has never been tested in court. 
t1_duqmy39	1	*	It sounds insane because you are insane, half of your news sources have undiagnosed schizophrenia. Its tragic, really. Sorry but theres no Illuminati.
t1_durc830	1	*	Surely nobody would be that stupid! 
t1_duqmiax	0	*	But what happens when Trump then pardons him with an everything shield times infinity?
t1_duqlhby	0	*	You gonna talk about how you wish terminal cancer on people? 
t1_duqlvw5	1	*	Every single one
t1_durrm2u	1	*	That's what I was thinking... But apparently the down votes say I'm not adding to the conversation
t1_duqsjx2	1	*	Does this magic word exonerate hypocracy? 
t1_dur066n	1	*	Until Mueller cracks the Trump egg, there's a lot of shareholder value to claim if you want to conspire against the United States.
t1_duqgqaq	0	*	That's the Republican plan in a nutshell. Just keep getting worse candidates, and their predecessor will eventually look good.
t1_dur3ois	0	*	Ok we need meme game then. Someone hit me with a fresh lib meme. I dare you
t1_duqmvcb	0	*	Can you really have autism if youre dead? Cmon guys, they thought this one out. Were just two step/s behind.
t1_duq90i4	1	*	That's *Mrs* Sassypants, TYVM, and I want to see what happens in six months, to see if your wishcasting has any foundation in reality.
t1_duqrmap	1	*	Only on Fox. Even his son knows he was pretty shitty 
t1_duqq73s	0	*	Ahhhh awesome!!!  Thanks a bunch for the enlightening news.  Having a really bad few weeks so this bring some good news haha thanks
t1_durjuo0	1	*	He meant bring back charges that weren't originally formally brought forward. Can't get pardoned for something if you haven't been charged with it yet. 
t1_duqoqzl	1	*	Uh well I can answer the first one and it is 2 years.
t1_duqnode	0	*	Miles Dyson?
t1_dur6ofd	1	*	And that's not even mentioning how he actively prevented measures against the AIDS-epidemic because it primarily affected gay men.
t1_duqqz1h	1	*	Lust /= love
t1_dur8nmb	0	*	Definitely, but those are the risks. The Russians don't exactly turn the other cheek either.
t1_dus0feg	1	*	Boy, youre timing sucks. Heres all the proof needed that your precious memo was full of nonsense. Too good!!  http://docs.house.gov/meetings/ig/ig00/20180205/106838/hmtg-115-ig00-20180205-sd002.pdf

t1_duqo91b	1	*	Including Mr. Manaforts former business partner... Oh, who didn't actually go to jail....
t1_duqjczu	0	*	The Right has always held up crooks as their heroes. G. Gordon Liddy got tons of Fox time too, and Roger Stone is STILL doing his dirty tricks for the white house, like 50 years later.
t1_duqrizh	0	*	Yes. He can pardon anyone for any federal crime, except arguably, himself. He can't pardon charges brought under state law though.
t1_duqt325	1	*	maybe that's why I wanna see more of them
t1_duqqjw4	0	*	Inspiring words. Unfortunately, Trump seems pretty resilient to words.
t1_duql05f	1	*	Hillary got three million more votes.

t1_duqobax	0	*	Wtf? Did your grandad have considerable amount of cash invested imto slavery memrobilia too?
t1_duqkzoj	0	*	How many people that Trump brought in have been indicted or plead guilty? Must be a bunch of coincidences  He hires the BEST people U0001f917   How are you not ashamed yet of supporting this idiot?
t1_duqlf8l	0	*	We passed then.
t1_duriddt	1	*	Trumps DOJ and Trumps FBI are partisan against Trump?
t1_durlrs2	1	*	So you're asking whether or not this is motive? Thats the only tie I can see for this separate case.
t1_dur3elk	1	*	Reportedly means the opposite of this.

t1_duqomvb	0	*	the investigation is going to flip is that before or after everyone in Trump's camp goes to jail?
t1_duqlcxi	0	*	I think he'll fake a heart attack or stroke and say that any falsehoods in his testimony are due to his medical condition. 
t1_duqrhvv	0	*	Yeah, that's literally what the Russia investigation is for. A cover for the DNC for staging their own primary and rigging the general.

t1_durb2d2	0	*	Not fine, expected and not worth worrying about. FYI America does it all the time, got a torch and pitchfork for that?
t1_duqjh6w	0	*	No, you can't rename things that occurred in the past.

t1_duqqien	1	*	> Trump to be so clean  If that isnt a joke, Im not sure what is. 
t1_dura5m9	1	*	Sorry, when you've got a pup in your lap math sort of goes out the window.
t1_dur462s	1	*	Wow that quote has some convoluted phrasing. 
t1_duqpvlr	0	*	If you lived here, you may have a different opinion. But that's just a guess.
t1_duqk19r	0	*	Yes exactly.  The left is rehabilitating all of the war criminals.
t1_durg7ts	1	*	>But he's America's uncle, so he gets a pass, for some reason.  The reason is (R). 
t1_duqvth1	1	*	Very high and mighty if you.   So brave of you to just say it like that.

t1_duqmvsr	1	*	> This has shit all to do with Trump.  They were the top two employees of his campaign. 
t1_dus6699	1	*	Frankly I can see no reason why he can't pretend to have never heard it. Unless there's some concrete proof that he's culpable he can and will sure as hell deny whatever they question him about. 
t1_durtrzq	0	*	You are getting so worked up. 
t1_dur0gi6	0	*	No.  I actually pointed out 2 AGs in the Obama administration.

t1_dsll1ti	0	*	Well since you have - hilariously - failed to notice that I'm not the same person as above it's your reading ability that needs work.
t1_dtj69r6	1	*	Walk along a Colorado street with an ounce of weed. Legal.  Take a step across state line, trafficking.  Same thing, different scope of the law.

t1_dtoz40c	1	*	Yeah forgot terry the taliban loves westerners 
t1_dtognzi	0	*	Why should that matter? Only problem I see is that /u/vokegaf is focusing on the legal/rights/free speech aspect of displaying flags which wasn't exactly the focus of the discussion.
t1_dtojk5y	1	*	No, Mussolini wanted to participate, however it's true that our military was utter trash. That's why we lost against people that weren't soldiers
t1_dtp2e0e	0	*	Why the fuck do they fly an american flag?
t1_dtoi3ys	0	*	Well, you are ignoring the obvious reality of the secession if you think it was about anything other than slavery.  Edit: And what agenda am I pushing, other than the agenda of well-documented facts?

t1_dtofp6s	0	*	No they haven't. People want manufacturing jobs but business interests would rather do that overseas. Where did you get this absolutely moronic notion?
t1_dtoj2dy	0	*	Because you were incorrect and I was correcting you.
t1_dton3w0	0	*	Lee wasn't in a position of success. General Stonewall would have changed Gettysburg 100%.
t1_dtohcph	0	*	Yeah I that's true. But it was too interesting not to include. 
t1_dtouoe1	0	*	Even if I was Italian how I'd that an insult? Seems like you are rasisct against Italians.
t1_dtomgta	0	*	That depends heavily on where in Spain you are, but looking at policy and recent history shows a whole lot of really questionable stuff.
t1_dtooyyf	0	*	I speak guy I can translate: she was hot.
t1_dtppsx1	0	*	You do know that Italy is in Europe and not in the Caribbean, right?
t1_dtotoda	1	*	That might be it. It's not hard to understand, it's just hard to emphasize with making random people responsible for the action of others only because of some similarities they share.
t1_dtoeyg7	0	*	Reconciliation. Look it up
t1_dtomjxn	0	*	> the type of person willing to chop up a body would also be capable of murder.   So we don't an investigation then? It's clear. He would be capable and that's all the police need.
t1_dtot2oi	0	*	Christ there's flags everywhere and people constantly talking about it.  The referendum last October was overwhelmingly for autonomy.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venetian_autonomy_referendum,_2017
t1_dtoyqwd	1	*	do you realize why attaching all these weird stipulations to this clearly wrong act is gross?  I don't condone murder but all these pesky immigrant amirite? 
t1_dtosai2	1	*	I think the problem is that you're even giving that notion a thought. A dictatorship would *not* work better than anything else.
t1_dtonh24	1	*	Official flag.  It was the one the troops gravitated towards though.
t1_dtoeqy6	0	*	Lazio probably
t1_dtol4qy	1	*	Yeah, not really. That's not at all what xd3xf0inn is about.   It's more likely he doesn't care what you do as long as you die in battle. 
t1_dtosy2q	1	*	I thought the exaggeration would be obvious. 
t1_dtofnfe	0	*	No, they haven't. They've just been sold out by leaders and major business decisions to manufacture where its cheapest. 
t1_dtoywvx	1	*	Cool!

t1_dtobonq	0	*	That's a facepalm moment if there ever was one. 
t1_dtug6a3	1	*	Oh, you're an idiot and an asshole. Got it.
t1_dtpv5xs	0	*	Thank you, Cathy Newman. How does anything my previous comment suggest that? Describe your thought process step by step.
t1_dtovnf5	0	*	Yeah but Hitler's Plan was still to turn slavs into slaves. So if he had won at some point the people from that nation would have still been turned into slaves
t1_dtomyzh	0	*	If English is your first language and it's this shit, I can't even imagine how fucking horrendous your Italian must be. Maybe that's why the people didn't understand you?
t1_dtomftw	0	*	> The guy knew really well what he was doing and why he was doing it.  So why was he doing it?

t1_dtons96	1	*	Have you ever been to T_D? It is a literal cesspool of cult behavior. 
t1_dtop243	0	*	But racism is in casual situations seems to be perceived a lot more seriously then other harsh insults and singled out more often.

t1_dtov0xl	1	*	Tasty ethnocentric sanctimony  
t1_dtolkwj	1	*	Even if it was an OD he did nothing to prevent her death. He was clearly with her at the time. So he just watched her die instead of calling an ambulance and then chopper her up and dumped body.
t1_dtoeud4	1	*	He's not _pro_-fascist, he's just anti-_anti_-fascist!
t1_dtot27n	1	*	In Australia you only pay costs of call for phoning a doctor.  Usually calls are unlimited so you're really not paying all that much 
t1_dton0al	0	*	In Canada we can.
t1_dtp9e0k	1	*	It's fine to find it in poor taste and object to it.  But to act as if defacing the dead body of an ex-fascist dictator is somehow blurring the line between antifascism and fascism is just silly.
t1_dtoozj2	0	*	My point is hes surprised because he lives a sheltered life. 
t1_dtorgik	0	*	To be honest this is true of most countries, Italy's not particularly bad.  Two semesters of any language isn't going to get you very far
t1_dtohlc2	0	*	You guys understand that you live through Irony right? Safe spaces, fake news, hate speech.. It's literally you guys.. It's why you don't see Nazis rushing to democrats for cover. 
t1_dtoldhg	0	*	So you're just not denying that you're racist anymore or what? Just trying to lie your way through it to justify yourself?
t1_dtoh8du	0	*	Why are you comparing 14-30 year old male migrants to the entire German population?
t1_dtowk19	0	*	So basically what you and the other commenter are saying- is that due to the fact one Nigerian killed a woman- all Nigerians or black people for that matter are responsible and should be shot at? 
t1_dtp28xc	0	*	Oh great, someone who has no clue about my country and also listens to the sobstory of this talkshow bitch that has long since been proven a blatant lie.
t1_dtokscy	1	*	Either way they lost and their ideals are seen by the majority of Americans to be poor ones. 
t1_dtosp3b	1	*	Sounds like it didn't take much to push you into an even more extremist mindset. But it's everyone else that's the problem, of course - never you, right?  lol
t1_dtovhr7	0	*	Are you sure you went to Italy and not Nigeria?  Even people from the south are white. A little darker yes, but white. People from the north are german white.

t1_dtp2gji	0	*	Ah, well that explains that. A lovely bunch of people. Aren't there any rules for journalists? Real objective journalism is hard but so obviously pushing an agenda is hardly journalism.
t1_dtqp5zz	0	*	That was after the war started. He didn't war to start the war (yet) but he didn't want to be seen as an useless ally and leave all the European cake to the Germans. 
t1_dtow8mr	1	*	Ahh. Doubt it then. This would've been near zywiec and Korbielow. Pieknxe9 place
t1_dtoh52m	0	*	You're banned because you represent the worst in humanity. t_d bans people because they're scared chickenshits and can't handle any heat that melt the snowflakes.
t1_dtp61mt	1	*	Yes. Querschlitzfut. Because of the eyes
t1_dtp0s5n	1	*	Better equipment mostly.  When you run a smaller fleet you can have better stuff
t1_dtopmum	1	*	Just don't ask me what it was...
t1_dtokmrv	0	*	No, but those failing material conditions cause people to gravitate to extremists.
t1_dtoews6	0	*	Disenfranchisement is an issue.  The Battle Flag is not disenfranchisement.
t1_dtp0ve5	0	*	The Marine jokes come a lot from being the red headed step child of the military in regards to equipment acquisitions.  There budget stems from the Navy so the tend to just get hammy downs. 
t1_dtsc5g0	0	*	Riiiiight
t1_dtolocw	0	*	You don't want total war, don't take a countries land and attack them. Pretty easy.   You probably also think it was about states rights...
t1_dtp1mnu	0	*	What does bone structure have to do with anything?
t1_dtoo2gi	1	*	Slavery was the economic engine of the South. That slavery was used to prop up an 'agricultural society' is more of a detail.
t1_dtouvm9	1	*	Yep. Neither the US, USSR, nor Britain won on their own: it was all three working together that brought down the Nazis.
t1_dtogpxs	1	*	Your little sub is the biggest safe space on this site  >It's pushed me much further right.  Because you're already a weak minded, racist fool
t1_dtoprpn	0	*	Not really. Marx had the diagnosis right, but his cure was poison.
t1_dtok1yu	0	*	Why I said pals and not family
t1_dtogk5d	1	*	Yea it makes more sense if it is talked about in the context of European countries. I assumed op was speaking generally hence why I thought it was so odd.

t1_dtolxu5	1	*	What's a map?
t1_dtp644j	0	*	'everyone ist stiflingly catholic' ho-ly shit. Where have you been? In Tirol or other backward regions of austria?
t1_dtp00uh	1	*	Annnnd there it is.
t1_dtokjp2	0	*	> The north nearly gave up the war  That is wildly misleading. They had dips in succesfull battles but saying they nearly gave up is absurd and doesn't even make any sense.
t1_dtpeltz	1	*	I'm guessing they're playing off generalizations about he US. Western themed stuff and the Confederate flag make sense in that context.
t1_dtp3lh5	0	*	As a black person there is definitely some real racism. Do you mean that you had a worse experience in Korea than in Japan? Koreans do some more confrontational
t1_dtppm8f	0	*	You say what a lot.

t1_dtp38hb	0	*	>Simply explaining why he did that.   Why?
t1_dtpijtw	1	*	'Racism' in the modern sense didn't even exist back then. People hates other groups for political and religious reasons etc, but not race.
t1_dtok9g6	0	*	It took your comment to make me realize how appropriate QED is in a thread about Italy.
t1_dtojeip	0	*	The Soviet Union operated labour camps and undertook forced resettlements throughout the war.
t1_dtolgx7	0	*	Oh okay. I was a little confused since Polish people didn't come across as racist to me. Foreigners are interesting and something new to their culture. Always nice to experience 
t1_dtohwvc	1	*	If such petty behavior from people on the internet changes your political view then I'd suggest reevaluating why you believe the way you do.

t1_dtolrhm	1	*	The individual doesnt understand because theyre indoctrinated retards. The collective knows its a thinly veiled threat. 
t1_dtoo41d	1	*	Gets funnier. In Russia there are people who romanticize the old days when Stalin was in power. In my country South Korea there are people who wants to go back to when the dictator Park was in power.
t1_dtppzce	0	*	They were probably jealous or inferior? That's quite an assumption. If someone calls me whitey and says they fucked my sister I don't care if they feel jealous or inferior. They're racist. 
t1_dtoodsj	0	*	We would save lives by being racists? 
t1_dtqtpjw	1	*	> Cause we are all gay nazis over here in europe ;-)  Mostly in Austria ;-)

t1_dtbzcf3	0	*	Damn, you sure aren't the brightest bulb in the box.
t1_dtcdqlz	0	*	Because he's a socialist compared to the rest of America. He would not be called that if campaigned in places like Scandinavia.

t1_dun354w	0	*	The fact that you're saying that land is more important than people in a fucking **democracy** is why everyone laughs at you guys. 
t1_dudtsea	1	*	Read the article
t1_dv29k1g	1	*	The snide comment about Alabama was in regards to them coming close to electing a child molester. It is well deserved. 
t1_dv394c6	1	*	Mobile and Birmingham aren't bad. 
t1_dsjjso0	0	*	Because you have no concern for means, only ends. 
t1_dtb8jcd	1	*	Very welcome, all the same
t1_ds5dwll	0	*	You can't trust them.  Example? Donald Trump.
t1_dtf1ma9	0	*	Statistically they are near zero. Its not a problem looking at the grand scheme of the criminal problems of the UK.
t1_dshd8c0	0	*	Fair enough, but still, being lumped together with pedophiles leaves a bad taste. It could of been phrased better...maybe? 
t1_dskvlcz	0	*	What has Haiti been robbed of and by whom?

t1_dsv5b5n	0	*	And the point of your comment is?
t1_dsv01vc	1	*	I mean you are technically right... so 
t1_dsvi65o	1	*	English is rich, encourage this behavior.

t1_dv2dz3a	0	*	Why shouldn't dogs be married? More rights for dogs!
t1_dv2k9gg	0	*	Well for a lot of years I switched focus to something even worse: electronic voting fraud and the reform efforts there.  And God DAMN is that a mess.
t1_dv2nldx	0	*	well, the Constitution hasn't really dealt with owning people since the 13th Amendment passed.   Which, if you think about it, is another wrinkle in corporate personhood. 
t1_dv2ztze	1	*	Sorry, I misplaced the Black Materia or I would have by now.
t1_dv2drcf	0	*	There's been a plague of neo Nazis protesting outside of Mosques while open carrying.  Could you imagine the uproar on Fox propaganda if Muslims did this outside Christian churches? 
t1_dv2e981	0	*	>Purge the Xenos plague with fire and blade. May the enemies of the *Imperium* fall before the Emperor's truth!  Ftfy

t1_dv2ij8s	0	*	Was she the one that made comments about making transsexual people use the correct bathrooms to protect children?
t1_dv2evs3	1	*	Its just a meteorological event
t1_dv2esya	0	*	Honestly if it came to it, I'm hedging my bets on the military siding with the civilians 8/10 times. No veteran I know would ever turn their guns on American civilians in their home.
t1_dv2fi74	0	*	I find it so hard to believe anyone would go through the effort. I think we're just dealing with retarded Americans here.
t1_dv2e6jp	0	*	Not unless you seek the favour of the Chaos gods 
t1_dv3kj1h	0	*	So you're just pandering for points? Shouldn't you be calling him Drumpf or something and saying he's worse than Crooked Hillary?
t1_dv2ff9b	1	*	if you live in a red state, yes
t1_dv3v8rj	1	*	Thats how these anti-anti-fascists actually think. They dont care what words mean, its all just lazy mud-slinging.
t1_dv2f1p0	1	*	Sure. https://www.thenation.com/article/never-mind-super-pacs-how-big-business-buying-election/
t1_dv2k8op	0	*	The second amendment has never been threatened? Seriously? The level of delusion in your comment is fucking staggering.
t1_dv2i46z	1	*	The issue there being that typically once people own and undertanad guns they are no longer in favour of gun control. As a 2A supporter I think yours is a fine idea.
t1_dv2ec3u	1	*	By order of the Inquisition an exterminatus operation is now underway.  The Emperor protects
t1_dv2mm5u	0	*	Address my points.
t1_dv32t7b	0	*	That's precisely what single issue means.
t1_dv2dxdv	0	*	> I think its important to try to understand the other side of the argument.  Heresy!  Blasphemy!  (sarcasm!  :-) )
t1_dv2h0st	0	*	But you'll pass for yourself right? Abortion is for other people, not you. You need to live.
t1_dv2itnh	0	*	Cars dont have as much of an impact on the world compared to computers and the internet that has been mainly fueled by American innovation so get your head out of your ass already. 
t1_dv2f55l	0	*	Your first point is unclear.   Your second point? He didnt get around it. I called it out. 
t1_dv2h6h6	1	*	Where'd I say that?
t1_dv2s8h4	0	*	The truly sad thing is that you wrote all this without realizing how fucking unhinged and insane you sound. 
t1_dv2rig0	0	*	If that's all you think the NRA does, then there's no real point in continuing this discussion. You've clearly already made up your mind.
t1_dv2g7h4	1	*	Ahhh the Reagan maneuver 
t1_dv2ivnz	1	*	Hey, northern neighbour here. Thanks for not being a flag-waving, nationalist douche. It's sometimes hard to see you guys through all the star-spangled jumpsuits.

t1_dv2eq6d	1	*	Nope. Salamanders are amongst the Emperor's most faithful servants.
t1_dv2a8j3	0	*	You just fed a russian troll account. Before you engage consider the other side. Sometimes its best to just ignore them.
t1_dv2gi0v	0	*	I'm curious as to what part of the country you're from.  You keep using the word village instead of town or community or city.  It's interesting.

t1_dv2zy2n	1	*	The twist was that it was Bruce Willis in a hairpiece the whole time.
t1_dv38wox	1	*	I've found all the help I need in our lord and savior Robert Swan Mueller III.  Praise be him and his holy quest to smite the conservative sinners and drain the swamp from on high. 
t1_dv2l63k	1	*	That couldn't really work again because, well, would *you* concealed carry as a black man after seeing the Philando Castile video?
t1_dv2jhcq	1	*	STFU troll. Your question was a loaded question anyway.
t1_dv2l492	1	*	I completely agree.
t1_dv2fis1	1	*	Sometimes the answer is just black and white
t1_dv3ml9a	0	*	As a physician I am capable of self-medicating.
t1_dv2jotk	1	*	OK, I'll keep it shorter:  1) Self defense is a basic human right.  2) Some people need a good killin'.
t1_dv3k9en	1	*	What's the 2008 definition?
t1_dv2obj1	0	*	Exactly. They figured out how to destroy the US from the inside out. 
t1_dv3bshm	0	*	John Podesta's emails:  https://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/52046  Doesn't explicitly say that, but implies it pretty heavily
t1_dv4m4j4	1	*	You're talking about people online. I'm talking about an investigation. The two are very different.
t1_dv2ugtg	0	*	XAXA we spend $0.50 more effective than Clinton's billions!!

t1_dv2o63y	0	*	#THEY'RE PUTTING CHEMICALS IN THE WATER THAT TURN THE ***FREAKING FROGS GAY.***
t1_dv3owye	0	*	That isn't really what CU was about. It was about the legality of banning people from making a political film before an election.  Please go to www.google.com and search for more info
t1_dv2ml4j	0	*	Well good thing I'm an independent, so I can objectively see that the GOP in it's current intonation is in a league of corruption all it's own. 
t1_dv2h5yi	0	*	So it's a matter of scale? What about an NGO that argues for gay rights? It runs off of donations, should they be able to say If you don't support gay marriage, we will fund your opposition?
t1_dv2gze1	1	*	Wacky inflatable tube-man emporium?
t1_dv38ryz	1	*	You're correct about that, I should have phrased that to say that they don't specifically focus on the 2nd ammendment.
t1_dv2d9lb	1	*	Yeah and trying to ban god from schools too. If these stupid libs don't like praying to Jesus they can GIT OUT!
t1_dv2flnm	1	*	Well I dont see the point in arguing that, so have a funny video your comment reminded me of. God bless Julian Smiths golden age. https://youtu.be/APyr48GACzc

t1_dvvv8pc	0	*	pro life folks vote Democrat because of their union telling them to? that's just a dream you thought up exists
t1_du528et	0	*	It isn't real capitalism. Corporate welfare, regulation, and subsides anyone?
t1_dujlehp	0	*	Lots of crimes happen everyday. Why are you so fixated on this essentially victimless one?
t1_duk2w57	0	*	I wasnt sure
t1_dujib1a	0	*	It's the Millennial generation. When a free and fair vote doesn't go their way they feel entitled to take to the street.
t1_dujzfqa	0	*	My favorite parallel was the congressman who was making secret trips to the White House on behalf of the administration. Sounds very familiar to Nunes. 
t1_dujzwy8	1	*	*gasp* Chris Farley!?
t1_dujsekg	0	*	Yeah, at least Camacho cared about the people and knew when to take advice.
t1_dujsq2c	1	*	You know it, I know it
t1_dujmg4c	0	*	 So why does the left continue to do it?
t1_duju7nj	0	*	I just read Terry's bio.  He does seem like a really decent human.  Artistic, conscientious, overcame personal obstacles, **humble**, etc.
t1_dujw0md	1	*	How has that been proven?
t1_dulde8e	1	*	I concede your first point.  Also, I've never seen a top comment on reddit being critical of Obama.
t1_duk2g65	1	*	I thought you guys were better at insults? This is just low energy stuff right here. If you'd like, edit your comment and try again. I'll pretend like I'm reading it for the first time
t1_duk2a36	0	*	What she was saying is still completely correct, a large portion of Trump's base is made of deplorable individuals, racist fear mongers.
t1_dujv133	1	*	Kevlar for school uniforms.
t1_dujpvq9	1	*	The Ministry of Truth
t1_dujqyua	0	*	Yeah, you probably don't really exist anyway.

t1_dukj4lk	1	*	oh wow youre a prick.
t1_dujvxal	1	*	Yup, because for some reason Republican voters see themselves as temporarily inconvenienced millionaires.

t1_dujoord	0	*	Yeah but the difference is why you would say it that way - I don't believe they interfered vs I don't know if they interfered. 
t1_dujm1te	0	*	If she believes she is speaking the truth, how is she evil? 
t1_dukcdgf	0	*	I agree that you should prove them wrong, but you can't prove T_D wrong.  It's not possible, because their truth is whatever they want it to be.
t1_duk6rrb	0	*	Your message trying to justify the stupidity of voting for an obvious con-artist like Trump (or not voting at all, for people like you) isn't even worth discussing further. 
t1_dujycfz	0	*	You get everyone on top and flip the ladder.   Or you just fire the drugs over with a catapult since now we're talking drug smuggling and not trespassers.
t1_dujkz2o	0	*	You know it. 
t1_dujyjxr	1	*	Peace to you as well 
t1_dujomno	1	*	I am a stick.

t1_dujuoz9	1	*	Best click of the day.
t1_dujwvge	0	*	Apparently the scheduling system at my school was designed to mimic a schedule for factory workers. I heard there was a push recently to change that. 
t1_dujr410	0	*	Lol, somewhere out there someone typed this up and thought to themselves they had a gotcha on their hands.
t1_dujisfr	0	*	It still makes a difference. Most of the rules changed by Trump's cabinet will be rolled back under the next Dem president. But calls/letters/protests will stop them from ever being made again.
t1_dujkj3w	0	*	Not the Russians though. Other people could be saying it too. 
t1_dujkro7	1	*	I don't know, man... everybody hates us.
t1_dujoxuh	1	*	lmao, solid argument there
t1_duk1zzr	1	*	Upvote Upvote Upvote Upvote
t1_duk2ifl	1	*	Its a pretty common defense mechanism when people fail to make a good argument. 
t1_dujog0o	1	*	More thoughts have been terminated by ignoring the well-regulated militia wording in the 2nd amendment.
t1_dujlq6c	0	*	No you made a claim. I don't have do to your research for you. You said that America had rigged more elections than every other country combined. Can you prove it or not?
t1_dujwao2	0	*	Correct. But he DID say that. Many times. 
t1_dujukaf	0	*	The president lies constantly. It's important to keep calling him out and not let it be normalized.
t1_duk4ny8	0	*	Blockchain voting NOW!!
t1_dujsws8	0	*	 Not sure I see any similarities between the two, actually. 
t1_dujmyzs	1	*	how is the government responsible for inflation?   Why are private employers not increasing wages to keep up with inflation?
t1_dujlkws	0	*	Not impossible, but if that's what he meant then he needs to be better at forming sentences, because that sentence does not mean what you say.
t1_dujxi9i	1	*	Could it happen? Texas wasnt that far off from 50-50 in the election.
t1_dujj179	0	*	I'm sorry, but I refuse to believe taking one day off for voting and staying informed once in a fortnight on current political affairs is a tall order.

t1_dujwey1	0	*	Which one of the presidents are you taking about? Clinton? Kennedy? Ibj? 
t1_duk8m9p	0	*	Now hold on a sec, we're not talking about collusion here. We're talking about him denying Russian interference.  Edit: notice how you keep moving the goalposts of the conversation. 
t1_dujkmek	1	*	Neither is a man who puts mashed potatoes in his crack
t1_dujkdka	0	*	And if we ignore enough misleading tweets, lies about Russian ties, federal indictments on high level staff etc etc we can just pretend its a witch hunt. /s
t1_dujkxe6	0	*	The first and last one. The second one is moving the goal posts. And it's Donald who wants to do the first one.
t1_dujviy0	1	*	I want to frame that and hang it in my house. 
t1_dukksa1	0	*	How does that prove your point?   At all? Lol...
t1_dujplj8	0	*	When you have no argument,  insult the person arguing with you, stay classy

t1_dul34dg	0	*	Huh. What a long-winded, bullshit way to shift burden of proof....
t1_dujoocj	0	*	Nothing to defend here... your post was all opinion (clearly about...). Gave me nothing to respond to, so there ya go.
t1_dujl061	0	*	Theres a bot somewhere on this thread that pulls alternative viewpoints. And all it could find from every source is (paraphrasing) Trump is a piece of shit.
t1_dujtcpr	1	*	Yeah its definitely not outside the realms of his actual tweets.

t1_dujxlvx	1	*	Its just a joke, bro
t1_dujz1r8	1	*	I don't care. If I saw Spicer bleeding out in the street I would call 911 then I would think to myself 'Karma, fucker'.
t1_dukc9or	1	*	Anyone with the same goals but who actually has half a brain. A competent trump would be terrifying.
t1_dujnc65	1	*	But they're sacred texts.

t1_dujk09i	0	*	>*I'm so ducmb.*  Hehe.
t1_dujxax5	1	*	Yup. Was a crazy election season. Wait until 2020 when the old school GOP runs a candidate against Trump and the Democrats still don't know who to run. That should be a fantastic shit show.
t1_dujlpfb	0	*	Ohhh I hated the colonel...with his wee beady eyes and that smug look on his face! Ohhh, you're gonna buy my chicken!
t1_dujjk5i	0	*	So where in that are illegal immigrants mentioned? 
t1_dujo3lx	1	*	You're hilarious. Thanks for the laugh.
t1_dujlvd4	0	*	The degree of open delusion in this comment is surprising and staggering: are you actually convinced Trump never said the things he repeatedly said on camera?
t1_dujwcb7	0	*	If you support an admitted sex offender, you're deplorable. Not rocket science. 
t1_dujv0w8	1	*	No its people down voting you.

t1_dujxf68	0	*	I feel like your analysis attributes more humanity to her than she actually deserves
t1_dujmwjz	0	*	That's a pretty vague answer. What do you mean by that?  What are banks doing that they shouldnt be allowed to do that leads to flat wages and increasing costs of living?
t1_duk5hxy	0	*	College drop out and graduation rates are a good start. What did you find from a 2 second Google search?
t1_dujv7ot	1	*	You don't know that, but yeah, we shouldn't just ditch attempts to fix this world, just in case it's not.
t1_dujkubj	1	*	Not what i mean. I'm talking like a reenactment of the fall of the Roman republic to the Roman empire. 
t1_dujqxb3	1	*	No, they stole the election with help from Donny Moscow and the Gaslight Obstruct Project party.
t1_dujucct	1	*	I mean yeah...he did some terrible things and now is trying to do PR to save his career?   What he had to endure  It's like people just forget that he was a willing participant lol
t1_duk1jhg	0	*	So if I understand this correctly, you acknowledge that Trump repeatedly says whatever he wants and directly contradicts himself, even in the same interview, and just don't care?
t1_dukrzn6	1	*	I support it.  As long as we also get rid of first passed the post.
t1_duk1zl8	1	*	You ain't wrong.

t1_dugj4lz	0	*	Alright batman
t1_dtk3zs0	0	*	> While the word is accurate, it's often connotated with hideous, scarring accidents that leave people deformed  Getting an important part of your dick cut off definitely counts as a deformity.
t1_dtjokde	0	*	still won't stop me from masturbating.
t1_dtjl77z	0	*	So what? You don't remember it. Why do they pierce baby ears? That's past 9 days isn't it?  Religious circumcision is gross to me, this isn't. I see this like cutting off a tail. 
t1_dtjjcyf	0	*	What do you call it when someone cuts a perfectly functional body part off?
t1_dtjjpg2	0	*	If you think that's bad, there were about 80,000 Americans (inmates and the mentally disabled) forcibly sterilized by the government in the 20th century, some as late as the 1980s.
t1_dtj83gj	0	*	So as long as we go about female genital mutilation in a non-violent and disorganized way, it's ok then?
t1_dtjgxkh	0	*	oh my fucking god that is APPALLING. What the fuck. 
t1_dtlqgde	1	*	I doubt that is the main reason although it could be in a very small percentage of cases. I think it's more ignorance than anything else. That explains why it's rarely done in Europe.
t1_dtk6cb5	1	*	Can not confirm had it done masterbation still feels great without the extra skin.

t1_dtjdaqx	0	*	By this definition, piercing a young girl's ears is also mutilation.
t1_dtjltkh	0	*	That page mostly says it's more dangerous to do it later because it claims it's more dangerous to be uncircumcised.

t1_dtk23dc	0	*	They do have a comparison actually, an uncut adult can get cut, and give a comparison.
t1_dtj5mz0	0	*	It really depends on how well you wash your dick, uncircumcised dicks are more sensitive around the area where smegma builds up (below the foreskin), so it's more of a hassle to wash for some. 
t1_dtk5vtk	1	*	Quite a stretch there but I agree. I will not do either.
t1_dtk4a58	1	*	and now for something completely different
t1_dtl0jax	0	*	It's neither recommended nor common in Europe, where those STDs are considerably less prevalent.

t1_dtjjcsh	0	*	isn't that what the nazi's said?
t1_dtjns7u	1	*	> potable water  You drink with your dick?
t1_dtj8inc	0	*	Question, do you actually know anyone who is mad at their parents for getting them circumcised?
t1_dtkhh72	1	*	It is a poor justification for the procedure, but it is a valid justification for an internal debate of right vs wrong.
t1_dtjjl4f	0	*	Oh no I didnt mean you-you. Just you as in the uncircumcised rabble. 
t1_dtj032z	1	*	> If you don't care about our layman's opinions, why should we care about your layman's opinion?  you just summed up Reddit in a sentence
t1_dtjx6v5	0	*	So, if someone's religious beliefs meant they had to kill a baby every Thursday then that's fine?  Religious people should not be treated with kid gloves. If something is wrong, it's wrong. 
t1_dtkn1p4	1	*	Though there are arguments that it can actually be a significant source of trauma for babies.
t1_dtj9klx	0	*	It's not a Christian or a Jewish problem. It doesn't need to be viewed through the lens of either. It's a medical problem, and only the medical concerns are relevant.
t1_dtkxogb	1	*	oh okay, I was just drunk and didn't even bother googling the statement. Thanks bro
t1_dtk75sn	0	*	Far less harsh!? Are you fucking kidding me!? 
t1_dtj1dg2	0	*	Circumcised penises are less prone to infections than uncircumcised ones...
t1_dtjl0oy	1	*	Prepare your butts babies since you wont remember it it doesnt matter U0001f644
t1_dtjc709	0	*	I want your peer reviewed sources if you are going to claim something like that.  Removing the clitoral hood is very similar to removing the foreskin as it makes a highly sensitive area desensitized.
t1_dtiyl3a	0	*	Completely unnecessary in all cases?
t1_dtjrn88	0	*	so putting a needle in them against their will ?
t1_dtjckh1	0	*	Except these beliefs do effect other people

t1_dtjk2bp	1	*	Dumbest post I've ever seen. 
t1_dtjv3ds	1	*	Same here with my uncles basement club. Things sure do change.
t1_dtixuu2	0	*	Then why are all dildos circumcised!
t1_dtjqx8h	0	*	More than that, a clitorodotomy is anatomically homologous.  So if your girlfriend wants you to have a circumcision: well, I will if you will
t1_dtk36eg	0	*	>  I went by my personal opinion and the opinion of my elder relatives.    So do people who choose Female Genital Mutliation for their daughters.
t1_dtjjj8q	1	*	I can personally confirm that women do think penises are either attractive or unattractive. It is naive to think that they do not lol
t1_dtj4pwv	1	*	this guy gets it
t1_dtk9nmn	0	*	Right, but when the site is obviously biased as heck, it would have to be considered cherrypicking their citations no?
t1_dyxo1as	1	*	So someone who disagrees with you is automatically a troll?  Im for the cause but the execution is sloppy as fuck.  Dont fall into PETA methods, because once you do you lost.

t1_dtjg9ru	0	*	Being raised with constant abuse is not the same as a one time trauma that will not be remembered.
t1_dtj6yka	0	*	That's a pretty massive generalizing statement about what women prefer...don't you think?
t1_dtj3ux2	0	*	>Bitch you are the one whose losing out.  That's like saying that it's better be to be poor than to be rich because rich people are losing out on being poor.

t1_dtj9e4t	1	*	Sweet I've always wanted to get my one year old a sick tattoo.  
t1_dtk8c1u	0	*	You had it done not long ago, once your penis rubs on your clothes enough and builds calluses you'll probably lose that sensitivity, though I hope you don't.
t1_dtjk54e	1	*	Im 100% against circumcision on minors but god damn no wonder my kids have STDs. */s*
t1_dtk6sv6	0	*	Well that escalated quickly...
t1_dtivwbj	0	*	Uh, you might want to look up something called genetics. 
t1_dtitxs6	1	*	Damn I wish I was flexible enough to choke on my own foreskin. 
t1_dtjqh0u	1	*	Shit man I'm sorry to hear that. I'm cirumsised, but my penis, especially the head, is definitely the most sensitive part of my body. I'd also definitely never say it's felt like it's chapped. 
t1_dtkbpwv	1	*	Dont get defensive. Were just talking facts. 
t1_dtjh3wk	0	*	I'm sorry but medieval persecution doesn't give you the right to mutilate babies genitalia. Maybe some of the persecution happened *because* Jews were mutilating babies.

t1_dtivbh1	1	*	How much more likely? 
t1_dtjdvkh	0	*	As far as I know it is legal for parents to spank their kids, so yeah... do it.
t1_dtjalzw	0	*	Some religions use psychedelic drugs, but the government had no problem banning the drugs in spite of that. Why should genital cutting be given a pass?
t1_dtku8y0	0	*	And if you weren't how could you know what it's like to be? 
t1_dtj8m4m	1	*	That's a matter of degree.  I think the original point was that the justification given in favor of infant circumcision couldn't be consistently applied to anything else without a great mental leap.
t1_dtjcony	1	*	i have no idea what i'm talking about then
t1_dtjk8c8	0	*	Theyre both spelled with English letters so whats the difference?
t1_dtkzwv1	1	*	foreskin also has a purpose. Shocker.
t1_dtjl4i6	0	*	> bland-tasting food would lower libido  Was he unaware of Irish and English food?
t1_dtk5tf9	0	*	No one said it makes sense.  But think how great it would be if it was actually more enjoyable.
t1_dtkfdf3	0	*	I think that's my point
t1_dtj3ro9	1	*	>but people are telling me I am losing out  just ignore them, those people are morons
t1_dtje0tv	0	*	For one, this isn't wrong, so there is that.
t1_dtkdkxh	1	*	Cool glad to hear it mate!   It's not 'flab' though : )
t1_dtk4qn2	1	*	Read your comment over a few times.
t1_dtj6lty	0	*	You keep saying, that I keep saying how much I like my dick. Maybe you should learn to read instead of commenting. 
t1_dtk94o2	1	*	Because the foreskin don't do an awful lot when you're boning.
t1_dtlc2s6	1	*	Hence why i said if it ain't broke, don't fix it. If it hurts huring an erection, it's broke and you fix it.  Otherwise, it's genital mutilation.
t1_dtipvbs	0	*	Go into reddit's search function and search circumcision for this subreddit. It's a weekly/monthly thing. 
t1_dtm4i8f	1	*	Nah, it's not that big of a deal as an infant... decent surgery as an adult.  Just easier to get done then
t1_dtk0jbe	1	*	Not really, no. My dick is fine thanks for caring so much about it though.
t1_dtj19kp	0	*	Any research that shows a baby having its dick trimmed without meds grows up to be traumatized?
t1_dtk2y83	1	*	Ah yes, Denmark, the only country in the world. 
t1_dtk0y79	1	*	thats fine but you have no choice and thats the problem
t1_dtjk4g0	0	*	So going the other way...how do you know that circumcised people ARE missing out? Have you had sex both ways? Because those are the only people that I'd like to hear an opinion from.
t1_dtj29df	0	*	Should it also be the child's decision whether or not to live? i.e. should we ban abortions?
t1_dtj90y0	1	*	My religious right to human sacrifice is being infringed upon. 
t1_dtkjcxx	0	*	Is it not harmful? Explain.
t1_dtjm3hv	1	*	clever
t1_dtkclgn	0	*	Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/7/z/dtiz56d) and tell me it's not child abuse.
t1_dtjju1z	0	*	The definition of genital mutilation is removal of part or all of the genitals. If anything, you're trying to sugarcoat it.
t1_dtjve40	1	*	LUL...
t1_dtksfhy	1	*	not more quickly, better
t1_dtlhq68	0	*	Exactly! And if you cut off someone's genitalia, they can't have sex properly! It's almost like if you cut off part of a body, it no longer functions how it's supposed to! Amazing! 
t1_dtk87mt	1	*	Um...okay?
t1_dtjbd4w	0	*	a small fold of skin this is what Americans actually believe,ladies and gentlemen.
t1_dtjphux	1	*	It's not as bad but it is still mutilation. It doesn't make sense to suggest otherwise. By definition it is.
t1_dtjblgi	0	*	And yet we ban circumcision of female infants, something many Muslim families do. Almost like Christians and Jews get special privilege...
t1_dtjd2ps	1	*	Ok you're right. Not libertarians then. Agreed.
t1_dtl4hj9	0	*	Like cancer/stds/hiv, do a quick google for your own good dude.
t1_dtj15ku	1	*	What's the difference?
t1_dtjlhqq	1	*	thx fam
t1_dtj92vt	0	*	It's not just skin.  It's not particularly small either.  Look at a detailed anatomical diagram of the foreskin and then tell me it's just skin.  It's NOT just skin.
t1_dtix8ub	1	*	Why? Why should I feel angry over that?
t1_dtmg8fm	1	*	I am aware of all sorts of claims you butthurt turtlenecks throw around to try to get people to stop making fun of your weird dicks.
t1_dtjnzf2	1	*	In my swingers club it's about 50/50.

t1_dtk1rr4	1	*	Do ppl in chess club get many chances to talk about their dicks? 
t1_dtitm3v	0	*	A tumor is an anomaly that should be removed. A foreskin is what **100% normal** humans are born with and not cause for concern... what else you got ?
t1_dtki7f7	1	*	They gonna throw their toys out of the pram after being asked to stop mutilating children?  What a loss, regardless of which religion.
t1_dtj3ye2	1	*	Ah okay. Great info
t1_dtkmppm	1	*	> What practical use does a foreskin have in modern times when we're covered anyways?  Quit redditing and look that up for yourself. It has a purpose.

t1_dv0a0q3	1	*	A rifle with a reciprocating bolt and gas powered loader is an automatic firearm.  The term semiautomatic was coined after such firearms were invented.

t1_dsxv7e7	1	*	so scary.
t1_dsxtwhr	0	*	I mean - fuck the rich is a pretty rational and well thought out, tbh.   Capitalism is a blight of exploitation. 
t1_dsycx5l	0	*	No, but I've played Turok. Same thing pretty much?

t1_dsxowxg	1	*	Makeover!!!
t1_dukc1t9	0	*	I'm fairly certain that the inventors of industrial machines knew someone would need to operate them.  Just as I'm sure the inventors of AI know no one will be needed at all.

t1_dsk3tyz	1	*	Well what do you know a bill to solve a problem that did not really exist enacted only to keep the base in line and the campaign contributions coming in. Who'd thought. But then it is America.
t1_dskdfwv	0	*	Othats euthanasia. In the food instury you are killing animals that dont need to be killed.
t1_dsji2st	1	*	maybe he went to highschool in 1940s japan i hear they were really down for the vivisection cause 
t1_dsjpmv5	1	*	Well *duh*  ...you **smelt** metal. Not kill it.   Obviously.
t1_dsk73ot	0	*	How would we classify the distress that they appear to be in when being boiled?

t1_dskf7kp	0	*	Does a tsuki knife count?

t1_du1whgr	0	*	What are you on about? I'm pretty sure I don't have any prison camps. 
t1_dszfcv5	1	*	Oh, USA does have rape problem. Every country does. No disagreeing to that.
t1_dsz7hf9	1	*	You also have to take into account that marital rape is not a crime in India. 
t1_dszb0m0	0	*	The definition of rape probably is different too.
t1_dszeiyz	1	*	Exactly, and that's stable genius.
t1_dszgtwj	0	*	Why are you being downvoted....?
t1_dszal6k	0	*	With fewer reports, there are also more uncertainty about the reported rape incidence rate.
t1_dsz8g6o	1	*	Ah, fair enough. 
t1_dsz5web	1	*	Most prison rape goes unreported,highest incarceration rate,private prisons and Hollywood normalizing prison rape.
t1_dsz78bo	1	*	Still better than 50 out of 1000.

t1_du8nvrj	0	*	But doesnt he have a point? I agree...
t1_du8wjr9	0	*	Well other sources have now been provided so we can focus the discussion on the content which really is despicable that any civilized country would treat children in such ways.
t1_du9glk0	0	*	Wow, you're stupid. Read this:   You aren't *replying to your source*, you're replying to me.   I posted this earlier, now go find it if you even care.
t1_dua10zn	1	*	Hmm, seems to me that exact image can and does apply to a hell of a lot of countries that the UN tends to outright ignore. *shrug*
t1_du8qm1w	0	*	The UN complained that the schools shouldn't be war targets even though there were weapons stored there.
t1_du96wup	1	*	You wouldn't like my opinion on it, but i don't like it either. Fact is, there will never be a win-win situation to this. People will die for it.
t1_du9basb	0	*	> The Palestinians have been teaching their children to be terrorists for decades  Was that about the time white Europeans started settling in Palestine/Jordan???  NO!!  COULDN'T BE! /s
t1_duatoem	1	*	I think they are both wrong yes.  
t1_du8qz7d	0	*	Attacking the source is a type of Ad Hominem fallacy.  Your argument is invalid.
t1_du90r4q	0	*	Yes that's forced coersion and they should investigate it. Then decide to do these interrogations only with witnesses(I.e. random citizens like a jury)
t1_duamesu	0	*	Rebutting what point? You put together a collection of bullshit statements.
t1_du9wuju	0	*	>So they were clearly lying, who cares? Israel sucks anyhow. \*insert generic rant here*  Fantastic stuff man.
t1_dv0eroi	0	*	Nothing to do with your claim that had they not been able to get into Germany they would have been gunned down in the streets. 
t1_dv0qkzz	0	*	No, it's just bribery. No matter the terminology, it's a bribe. Everyone here knows it, but the people that would make it illegal are the same people getting bribed.
t1_dv0pxjz	0	*	Still, for every terrorist driving a truck through a crowd in Europe, there is like 300 school shootings in the US.    I know where I'd prefer to live.
t1_dv0s07g	0	*	Replying to you to hopefully see the person's reply. I'm seriously considering leaving.
t1_dv0xt1k	1	*	Like Boris says, you just have to read it more positively!
t1_dv0xfo4	0	*	Thailand first, then China, and now Vietnam.
t1_dv21gy8	0	*	I'm not sure what your point is. Even if they cater to all markets, they are still the dominant force in determining what is labeled organic.
t1_dv10zwn	0	*	It feels different. Nobody voted for Trump still expecting him to lose - anyone that voted for him wanted him to win and thought he could.
t1_dv14gk3	0	*	What garbage are you spouting? 
t1_dv0vhjt	0	*	Yeah nobody says anything about using GMOs somewhere else only that they make no sense for Europe. 
t1_dv0sl3b	0	*	> Wait, what does Brexit mean exactly?  Simple: Brexit means Brexit! /s
t1_dv0wvmv	0	*	Well, by the time we get rid of the tories they will probably have done so much damage to the economy that we'd be net beneficiary if we went back into the EU.  
t1_dv0xqpx	0	*	I'm still pulling for Brexit to lead to 32 counties my friend. If any good thing can come of it, it's that. But the hard border is a terrifying prospect if it goes the other way
t1_dv0z834	1	*	I knew you meant that! I was just agreeing with extra words lol
t1_dv0soas	0	*	No one knows. Everyone's just winging it and making random claims about what can and can't be done.
t1_dv0rvjs	1	*	Sorry, I should say the pros outweigh the cons.
t1_dv12uwp	0	*	Yeah, thats exactly how science works. You do some research on the topic, case closed, never to be touched again.  GMOs will be legal eventually, but dont expect it to happen in the next few years.
t1_dv0w9fy	0	*	It probably does. But one needs to read those papers to know it.  It's way easier to just listen to a politician yelling I want my country back! instead.
t1_dv0qkb7	0	*	I mean, beside metalwork and fancy pots, what did the Roman ever did you ya?
t1_dv1nnku	1	*	Thanks 
t1_dv10p79	0	*	Yep, good times, back to unemployment, poverty and being isolated from the continent. Must be fun...  Let's get that table in the corner shall we? 
t1_dv0ppsr	1	*	I meant cumulatively but yeah I could imagine spending millions each might burn a whole in the company's pockets.
t1_dv0qgzy	1	*	But some places are worse than others. 
t1_dv0syz3	0	*	> because the UK doesn't want human rights in the jails.  I'm a British expat so forgive me, but was that really one of their reasons? Because that's ridiculous. 
t1_dv0qrkd	0	*	Thank you for this excellent comment. It sucks that the people who hold the power to reform are the people who directly benefit
t1_dv2jiwr	0	*	Calling the EU fascism shows how dumb you are.
t1_dv0sc97	1	*	Stop! Stop, will you?! Stop that! Stop it! Now, look! No one is to downvote anyone! Do you understand?! Even, and I want to make this absolutely clear, even if they do say 'Britt's'. 
t1_dv0sl3f	0	*	Lol like anyone has a fucking clue
t1_dv0spob	1	*	We literally had the best deal out of anybody in the union.  Amazes me to this day the people fail to see that. We had our cake and we could eat it
t1_dv0yd7e	1	*	They classified our bananas!! How dare they! 
t1_dv0pceu	0	*	Meaning the transfer of genes that could (or would?) not normally be combined through natural processes (Such as fish genes applied to tomatoes)? 
t1_dv0pjmx	0	*	Who told you they we're terrible for farmers? They are almost always insanely profitable.
t1_dv147np	0	*	A lot of the farmers get paid to not farm their land.   Some would rather farm. 
t1_dv1i9kg	0	*	Its a textbook example of a straw man. You interpreted questioning as denying to make an attack easier.
t1_dv0uzih	0	*	You had your chance, and your blew it.
t1_dv144a4	0	*	You wouldve done really well if that happened. Especially with Mr Alex oil price will never go down Sammond. 
t1_dv1jx5b	0	*	There only natural in some areas human intervention has spread them and in many areas they are considered a invasive species and would not naturally inhabit that area
t1_dv0wvve	1	*	We need to start arming our teachers with swords.
t1_dv0w6kc	1	*	Just wait til the shitstorm of whether all the old Brits who retired to Spain for cheap, sunny retirement are going to be forced to pay for very expensive healthcare hits the news!
t1_dv0v78v	0	*	There are two types of people who vote conservative.   Rich people, and stupid people. 
t1_dv20epg	0	*	They probably aren't as well rounded overall I imagine. I suppose you could add in some Soylent for that, maybe?
t1_dv1d32x	1	*	IKEA get fucked
t1_dv13ir9	0	*	Speak for yourself! My science is better than yours
t1_dv0w3jx	1	*	If hybrid seeds weren't good, farmers wouldn't buy them.
t1_dv0zdw4	0	*	>Hillary was the very definition of establishmen  Well as it turns out, the establishment exists for a reason, so I feel nothing but schadenfreude for those people.
t1_dv14xpj	1	*	You're right in that there is no big vegan.  It's the same damned food and agriculture lobbyists as always pushing for loose definition of all natural and other shit like that.
t1_dv0rxzf	0	*	*superpacs
t1_dv0uaux	0	*	Lol so much projection. You're the only one name-calling. 
t1_dv0uz3g	1	*	Its ok, Just think about all that extra sovereignty youll be able to put in the bank.
t1_dv0snyb	0	*	Isn't all of this true of any other political entity?
t1_dv0u7e9	0	*	What non gmo crops are able to use glysophate?   
t1_dv1247l	0	*	Yep, they should have made it extremely clear before the referendum that it would only be used as a guide rather than as an irreversible decision. But that's not how it was, and here we are. 
t1_dv0zpo3	0	*	Yeah, sounds like an idea for another Black Mirror episode.
t1_dv0u5m7	1	*	Around a 48/52 ratio between the both of their votes.
t1_dv0xwrt	1	*	Don't be ridiculous there's money to be made!
t1_dv0tift	0	*	How about hiring an expert in the field if you need briefing. 
t1_dv0t21f	1	*	Y'all say this but he probably based that theory on the Queen's English stuffing silent Us into every word that'll have them
t1_dv0teow	0	*	That's just strawmanning. I'd prefer to see refutation of the studies in question instead of just calling people luddites. 
t1_dv1nn03	1	*	I was making a general statement, not related to this.
t1_dv1k4nm	0	*	That's the result of two party system. Dems (republicans light currently) and Republicans will switch power forever. They are both winners in this system. You need to get rid of fptp voting system. 
t1_dv0tlj2	0	*	But unlike the sun coming up north, it's reasonable, just go and look at the many invasive species around. Also there could be a cure to cancer.
t1_dv0s26r	0	*	Yeah that's what confused me. I consider myself British & European. 
t1_dv10na3	0	*	Accept it? shit Im hoping for it.
t1_dv1ki8v	1	*	> Can you suggest a better alternative?  Independently verified voluntary labeling.

t1_dv0qz6e	1	*	Upvote for the reference!
t1_dv0vr5i	0	*	sounds like you and your best friend bump uglies. thats rad. 
t1_dv0sp0t	1	*	Also non-browning and vaccination against disease
t1_dv0ubqz	1	*	Thank you!
t1_dv3kqwo	0	*	Yea I do. Millions of people across the country with guns would be nearly impossible for a military to defeat.
t1_dv0rugm	0	*	I like that our economies are tied with everyone else.  Humanity should, hopefully sooner rather than later, become one.  Yes, I am for a world government.  Scary sounds play.
t1_dv0tefz	1	*	Yep, works exactly as intended. 
t1_dv0vfya	1	*	Some people are motivated by principles rather than selfishness. Crazy, I know. 
t1_dv0tg2z	0	*	We need a united 32 county Ireland 
t1_dv1e992	1	*	No its not Im at my house right now not in a movie
t1_dv2b2l7	1	*	Fishermen will likely be the biggest group of gainers from Brexit, as UK control of UK waters could cut the number of competitors fishing in the same waters.
t1_dv0rw8g	0	*	He probably heard it from https://foodbabe.com. >.<
t1_dv14wft	0	*	Who says that you have to override something in order to get concessions from congress? Politicians don't really care where your money comes from so long as it's legal tender.
t1_dv0uzca	0	*	I can't say for certain on the other things but I'm positive Gibraltar will remain, they'll probably try to keep the Irish border open too, though I can see big problems coming from that. 
t1_dv0puhx	1	*	I'm not against it, just pointing out. And it depends wether the crop is resistant to pest/herb-icides like you said or parasytes.
t1_dv0welb	1	*	Hey! They sounds like the GOP! 
t1_dv10lh3	0	*	Wow the mental gymnastics of this are amazing.
t1_dv1a07e	1	*	Chime in all they want. But don't bribe your way in or else democratic voices won't be heard through the money pouring in.  There's lobying in the EU. Just not legalized bribing like in the US
t1_dv0ss6c	0	*	But irradiation or chemical mutagenesis is not. Go figure
t1_dv1lhgr	1	*	Come to Canada and ask for free healthcare undocumented.   Spoiler alert: not free
t1_dv130zb	1	*	Theres a huge field of questions regarding the safety of GMOs. Safety for consumption isnt one of them in any serious debate.
t1_dv0xdk8	1	*	Its a two way street you wont see from either side. This Reddit dur hur bullshit is a way to stroke ones ego when youre a minority opinion.
t1_dv0zxdq	1	*	Yeah sorry about that. I didn't mean to blow off what you were saying, my bad, I just enjoy bringing up the ancient knowledge of asbestos anytime it is mentioned.  
t1_dv1gjo6	0	*	Grow your own shit. 
t1_dv2vsey	1	*	Aw thanks :) happy cooking!
t1_dv0vy22	1	*	You have accurately described the kind of normalisation that occurs when something that should be illegal stops being so. 
t1_dv1bp5e	0	*	Oh they arent  poor. And they act to prevent any possibility of that happening. 
t1_dv0va34	1	*	https://ourworldindata.org/fertilizer-and-pesticides  We are using more pesticides than ever. Some of it can be attributed to increased population but not all of that. Its definitely not going down.
t1_dv0wrwp	1	*	Welcome to America!  wait...
t1_dv0xrg1	0	*	Yeah, I was about to say I doubt the Irish would be happy with Brits doing anything short of getting fucked.
t1_dv0xxry	0	*	Oh, alright. I wasn't trying to start a debate anyways. I thought info on the mites was pretty common. 
t1_dv1mpiy	0	*	I'm preeeeeetty sure the 'date' was always 'the day that Britain leaves the EU'. I can't imagine anyone saying that Brexit will be disastrous for Britain before Brexit happens.
t1_dv0qp9i	1	*	Thank you for a more nuanced view, it definitely is in need for reform!
t1_ds17f9d	1	*	I guess the army could try a bit harder on the psych end of things.
t1_du8ku0o	1	*	Because you sometimes want to go outside of the city and suburban transportation is shit and expensive. 
t1_dua7r6g	0	*	why do they have to be mentally ill? why cant some people just be that lazy?
t1_du90jw4	0	*	I'm not confused, you are just an American trying to invent shit that doesn't actually exist. 
t1_du8x3j0	0	*	Yeah thats really nice. Im kinda new to Germany and getting to know things like this help a lot. Danke!
t1_du8klhf	1	*	Touchxe9.  I just looked it up, in Germany, the money the raised by the gas tax goes into road maintenance, too.
t1_dua19z8	0	*	As a person I have to say though, that fewer persons dieing is in this case the larger benefit. I might be biased though.
t1_du8716b	1	*	I will be happy to see a source for that very bold statement of yours.
t1_du8x1jo	0	*	The software is hosted completely online, the key just lets you use it. They're one use.  Otherwise yeah. Yarr harr fiddle dee dee.
t1_du87hfk	0	*	How do you subsidise a company if you already pay them? This would make no sense. They simply pay them what they need.
t1_du96af7	0	*	Seriously. You need to paint this in a paper and count.   I can't comprehend how you can be still confused about this. I'm pretty sure I could explain it to a teenager. 
t1_du988w3	0	*	This is bonkers. I mean, I feel for you guys. But...fuck am I glad I don't live in the US. To me it seems that every aspect of your lifes is just a money grab.
t1_du8kdc4	1	*	We could've done that too but our system keeps the accountants and TurboTax in business. Also, more complicated tax codes makes it easier to hide laws.
t1_du8hl72	0	*	Train into de same direction, but just the Metro (the underground). 
t1_du8d11t	0	*	We do both. At the beginning of the next year we calculate what we owe and pay it, and the government tells us if the calculations match theirs. If it doesnt, you have to actually talk to people.
t1_du92zhd	1	*	You decide
t1_du9ybyr	1	*	If you miss it due to your fault (or rather, not their fault), you need a new ticket. If you miss it due to their fault, get a confirmation that you're good to go from e.g. a conductor.
t1_due46za	0	*	It comes down to time of day in my book. Also, Uber is 2-3x more expensive than most places when going by millage. Basefare is pretty reasonable though.
t1_duv6of5	1	*	A well educated guess supported by an established pattern of behavior across europe.  Economic anxiety?  You don't know what my economic situation is.
t1_duwhzu5	0	*	How interesting.   *Dont go shoot up a school now, or be the coward cop who waited outside*  --amtcp 4 hours ago as of this comment.
t1_duv4uag	1	*	Believe which premise?
t1_duwi4lt	0	*	smfh. YA THINK GENIUS?!?!?!
t1_duv0iwh	0	*	Sorry, what has that got to do with this year's rise in rape reports in the UK?
t1_dsd6t0w	0	*	The moment the queen takes a step the gov don't like she will be forced to abdicate, it's why she has power but never uses it, the royals are just ceremonial figureheads at this point.
t1_ds29ur7	0	*	Why do they differ? There has to be a reason...
t1_ds29tvj	0	*	That is a sample set of just one. Hardly authoritative.   Have YOU ever considered working part time in order to spend more time raising your children? If not, then why not?
t1_ds1wj6j	1	*	The asterisk is there and it shows that the post was subsequently edited.   
t1_dtbjmg6	1	*	https://www.commondreams.org/news/2018/01/26/worlds-oceans-last-year-hit-hottest-temperatures-ever-recorded-far  Better analysis of the study than Vice's

t1_dul8mqz	0	*	Im a navy seal.
t1_dul194a	0	*	Not in Korean nope. There isn't one press release of theirs that doesn't contain the clause If the US strikes first
t1_dulhpuk	0	*	Spare me the overly emotional pathos BS. I had relatives who actually died in those camps.  The US has no moral authority in the world anymore.
t1_dul341q	0	*	Yes the same nation.
t1_duladyp	1	*	I gave a legitimate reason as to why it's not an immediate necessity to disarm these countries AS WELL as to why an unstable rogue one should NOT have them
t1_dul3487	1	*	yes. 
t1_dulnj44	1	*	Sorry I don't have gold for you, but do accept this upvote.
t1_dulj5jp	0	*	Only 62 million people voted Trump. In a country of 300 million, that means 21% of the country voted for him. Even if you go by voting age Americans, he only won 26% of the vote.
t1_dulge3d	1	*	Wrong, a major minority of those that voted for him didn't 'like' him. No one liked either candidate but those are the candidates the media wanted.
t1_dul08b5	0	*	better at killing brownies? sure.
t1_dul52zt	0	*	Ahh the subtle differences between abusing your own people and genocide. 
t1_duky2d6	0	*	>Missiles fired at Japan? Over Japan, more correctly, at almost twice the height of the International space station.  It's cool dude! I wasn't shooting my gun AT you! Just NEAR you! 
t1_dukzkn5	1	*	I sometimes think that few people understand how much NK and all of Korea hates Japan and why.
t1_dulzsy6	1	*	It seems he did send a message
t1_dulkv5q	0	*	1) advising people to go to T_D should be done carefully, in a hazmat suit if possible.  2) it's been made clear that that subreddit is largely bots influencing the gullible.
t1_dum755j	0	*	Uh okay...  Hey South Korea, the leader of North Korea is an unpredictable psychopath.  He may shell some of your cities and surrounding islands or he might not. Keep your head on a swivel.
t1_dulonwb	1	*	Seems a bit like a teenage girl giving them the cold shoulder type of thing
t1_dumnc4s	0	*	Sure you will, just like the last 60 or so years. Been doing great so far.
t1_dulj1ev	0	*	 Only 20% of the country voted for Trump.

t1_dtu7owq	0	*	Who said anything about publishing names?

t1_dtai2jy	0	*	You got any other ideas?
t1_dtakvu0	1	*	it does seem like its just him and his toolbox running around the world solving societies problems.  Like a modern day Santa Claus
t1_dsidn9t	0	*	Except that the ones doing the massacres were Christians and Palestinian.. but, who cares about the actual perpetrators /s
t1_dsiz14g	1	*	FUCK, HOW DO I RESPOND TO FACTS??  Edit: for real though. Nobody talks about the persecution of Bahais in Iran and neighboring countries. People either ignore the truth or try their best to deny it.
t1_dtaxpyh	0	*	Actually, you have not been paying attention - the Anglosaxon Empire is run by protestant England and they have been feuding with the Catholic Church for at least 500 years or more...
t1_duh485i	0	*	Are You're seriously suggesting we ban cars? Wut?
t1_dtas92b	0	*	I spent a few hours looking, and managed to stumble upon [this evidence](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=japanese+male+employee+commits+suicide+-woman), at least.
t1_dtlno6u	0	*	I have turkish friends. I only despise dumb turks like you. You are a filthy turk compared to my turkish brothers. OFC american bombings kill civilians.  what has it to do with anything i just said?
t1_dt8n1qy	1	*	I called you out on your comment history because it backs up my assertion.  Simple as that. 
t1_dt8vxpj	1	*	I'm not arguing for a position. I'm stating observations.  I'll be back in a bit, I'll find a better source then.
t1_dupvsta	0	*	Were you being sarcastic in the first post you made? Or are you just unaware of what point you were actually trying to make?
t1_dugg4xc	0	*	We have been protesting. There have been several record-breaking protests against Trump in the past year.
t1_dugn5i8	1	*	In any other democracy yeah we live in a republic.
t1_dugjr50	0	*	It's mostly because Americans have yet to be pushed to that proverbial breaking point, coupled with the fact that there is already an ongoing official investigation.
t1_duh7dkh	1	*	Protest? Aint nobody got time fo dat!
t1_dugnzii	1	*	Those countries don't exist 
t1_dugip7y	1	*	Fuck I hate the 2 party system.
t1_duge8xr	1	*	At this point is it really a laugh? This shit is beyond funny now and is well into humiliating
t1_dugegcf	0	*	So speculation. 
t1_dugt8n2	0	*	What are your accomplishments in life? Anything of note? 
t1_duhwaez	0	*	And this, which completely ignores what I said, further convinces me I am right about you being a Russian.  And now you are killfiled, partly for ignoring what I said.
t1_duh2xgk	1	*	Oh.
t1_dugjjqa	0	*	Definitely not. I can assure you that European women are anywhere from 10 to 50 times more prudish than American women, depending on the country.
t1_dugeijv	0	*	[The people who voted of course.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxsQ7jJJcEA)
t1_dugn0uz	1	*	Its not like he got a blowjob from a staffer or anything. 
t1_duggdkf	0	*	So you're basing your perception of all Americans on your experiences visiting American subs and floating the idea?
t1_duhaauq	0	*	...that's not how this works. That's not how any of this works! Midterm elections don't use the electoral college.
t1_duh8rcd	1	*	How does the average American afford to protest? We don't all live in countries the size  of a thimble where it costs fifteen Euro and takes two hours to get to the capital you smarmy prick.
t1_dugn66j	0	*	Al Capone route?
t1_duhs1wj	1	*	 It's like an anti-establishment fantasy. Let's face it, people don't come to conspiracy forums seeking the truth, they come looking for conspiracies  
t1_duh8czz	1	*	Am korean, Americans are waaaay too lazy to do what we did.
t1_dugo9op	0	*	It was registered to DONALD J TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT INC
t1_dugef8h	1	*	He has done far more than just wasting time. I would applaud him if all he did was waste time.
t1_dugdm8n	0	*	Well, do you regret your decision? Serious question, not looking to argue.
t1_dugmpte	1	*	Probably, probably, maybe, what if. Trump is fucking up shit for everyone right now
t1_dugprgm	1	*	Protesting can be pretty successfully disarmed by media campaigns in America. Remember what the 99% protests accomplished? Nothing, except a general public negativity about the protests.
t1_dugujaz	1	*	The primary focus should not be to put Trump in prison. If Mueller proves collusion and Congress doesnt act to remove Trump from office then there are other things to worry about.
t1_ds3ugh6	0	*	Its sound logic because hes protesting the right side, was that not clear enough?
t1_ds5btzg	0	*	Obviously I was referring to the government not random voters. Use your head for once.
t1_ds3vwpc	1	*	Yes!/s
t1_ds3uj4a	1	*	Right, and now it is with the FTC again and those same rules from pre-title II are back in place.
t1_ds55rux	0	*	Ah I thought that would be implied, sorry. yes in Iran.
t1_dt6wtcd	0	*	Do you have the mind of a 12 year old? 
t1_du3l6ek	0	*	Not sure if you ever finished highschool English but little county =/= little country....  Seething envy. Hah I wouldn't live in the US if you paid me lmao
t1_ds8th1l	1	*	So you're writing off his opinion because he is palestinian. Should we write off Israelis opinions as well because of the anti-palestinian bias?
t1_ds7xyoa	0	*	That sounds like a distinction without a difference to gaza school children that don't have textbooks, paper, pens, pencils, electricity, hummus, or schoolrooms with roofs.
t1_ds7y9fl	1	*	oh hahaha didn't even notice that. shouldn't be writing comments at 2am I guess.
t1_du2736e	0	*	National level polling was off right up to election night...  Only when the deed was done (exit polling) did the national level polling start to get the numbers right.
t1_du10tch	0	*	Nice job, quote a paper that covered up video of Obama telling a room full of antisemites that he hated Jews as much as them. Yea, no bias there at all... Right? 
t1_du0y082	1	*	It's typical Russian propaganda. Putin has been doing it for ages.
t1_du2j5h5	1	*	No witty comeback you partisan hack?
t1_du19pv8	0	*	The fact that you say that with 100% certainty means you are not thinking.
t1_du0wwcl	0	*	Remember that the travel ban is still in place :) , and the Pipeline is being built :)
t1_du10rp1	0	*	Deplorable  Remember, if you don't vote for Clinton, you're a racist, homophobic bigoted nazi. Heard that a lot toward the end of 2016. I thought they were *both* terrible.  
t1_du19376	1	*	Lol you people fucking suck.
t1_du21cmz	0	*	Been watching the dems eat themselves lately, its what happens when the group is made of divided factions. Pathetic.
t1_du15trv	1	*	Doesn't make it better
t1_du18b38	1	*	That's weird, when the hell did these comments become controversial? Lol
t1_du0qy2b	0	*	Hope we find out.
t1_du12uag	0	*	Don't forget I'm going to use my position of power to manipulate legislation to make Trump as much money as possible. The only real reason he ran. 
t1_du14d9l	0	*	They did include that it was politically funded. The Who doesnt really matter. If Trump paid for the damn thing it would have included the EXACT SAME LINE
t1_du4n33l	0	*	Do you have an article about a budget for /r/the_donald  like I do, and like are all over the internet about Sjhareblue and David Brocke?  Because it doesn't exist. 
t1_du133wv	0	*	Can you lean this format on mobile?
t1_du0wfbc	0	*	Ah, the Steve Bannon Special
t1_du0wcn1	0	*	Hey, the Buick may be a tacky broken piece of shit, but it doesn't discriminate on who it's going to break down for. 
t1_du1eyv9	1	*	Okay but who are these 6 people.   Who died? You're meaning Rich?  Who got money from the above acts?
t1_du167s7	0	*	You are right. She should totally run against Trump again.
t1_du13gyo	0	*	Only if he's touchy with women. 
t1_du0zhul	1	*	With leather seats that is clearly just some vinyl stables to the headrest 
t1_du1mm9k	1	*	He did insult several people, and nowhere will you find a single good word from me about trump. You do realize we had *two* terrible candidates in 2016.
t1_du1ck6u	1	*	You obviously don't get it either.  Is the point of this investigation and the warrant to find out if anyone criminally conspired with Russia or is it to nab the selected target for perjury?
t1_du1hpq1	1	*	Well, you never know. It might lead to Civil War 2 and World War 3.
t1_du1q467	0	*	Proof that he invaded Ukraine? Really?
t1_du0yx7f	1	*	The argument started by someone comparing Clinton to Trump. I think in this context, it's unfair to claim *whataboutism*.
t1_du0vry8	0	*	How can the laws of nature be controlled by anyone? Does he not believe that the earths atmosphere is what keeps us warm by trapping heat from the sun?
t1_du4n6ad	0	*	I am sorry skippy sheeple person, but are you going to argue that a transcript is over ruled by someone's comments on Reddit? Because that is what you are arguing now. 
t1_du0xpta	1	*	Mmm Hmm, I hear you but what's the Blue Book Value?
t1_dsvuucw	0	*	You know national socialism is far left, right?
t1_dsvrdcr	0	*	Yes, reducing 'love' to 'hugging' is definitely the major issue here.  Tell us, how exactly does one use 'love' to counter Islam or the Nazi war machine?
t1_dswr9hi	0	*	If Pope Francis says we should accept all Syrian Refugees from Africa it doesnt mean anything to US conservatives, because theyre not catholic.
t1_dswfzo7	0	*	But muslims immigration is gonna destroy them, off course since you are a Muslim, you don't care
t1_dswab9c	0	*	Dude, stop with the straw man shit. We're not talking about housing the homeless. We're talking about people who want to immigrate, work a job, and pay their own way.
t1_dswkx3u	0	*	You'd still be getting help from Catholics in this scenario. Immigrants aren't deported if they move from New York to Ohio, just more bored.
t1_dswrf4f	0	*	I think he means the quote was from the Khafir, not the Quran.
t1_dsxdequ	0	*	So you know more than Jesus did himself. Check. Got that. And this is how it was lost in translation. 
t1_dswril2	0	*	To be Roman Catholicism isn't the original form of Christianity as it was practiced in the decades after Christ's death. 
t1_dsw119j	0	*	Not all Germans that time were Nazis. 
t1_dsw6t24	1	*	It requires a non-local summoning of insight that will enable you to access the quantum cycle itself. 
t1_dtedwd2	0	*	No one knows for sure, but there are a lot of indications that money laundering is a big one. Also a lot of evidence tgat obstruction of justice would be on this list.
t1_dtejmi1	0	*	Ive had people tell me that actual video of Trump saying things is fake. Hell, Trump even tried it with the grab-em video. Theyve lost all sanity.
t1_dtegbyu	0	*	I am so sorry I read your comment as saying the allegations were not true. I sincerely apologize.
t1_duevni9	0	*	The first comment that started this thread was deleted and is not up. Not sure if you don't understand that or you're just dumb. Either way, done having *discourse* now. Cheers.
t1_duexbcl	0	*	You haven't really mentioned anything that Trump has done... 
t1_dsmktgw	1	*	*Well then, you'd better go and catch it!!*
t1_dsn208c	1	*	You mean like George III?
t1_dsmo41o	0	*	> Socialism is the new communism.  Can you elaborate on what you mean by this?
t1_dsmrjhr	0	*	Yeah that's right, you pointed it out after they changed their tune. Well done!
t1_dsmlure	0	*	You're talking in absolutes for no discernible reason. Countries have more socialistic tendencies than others, that's all people are saying.
t1_dsmskyg	0	*	Be depressed about that all you want to, UK food sucks BAD. I'll stick with my fattening but delicious American food.
t1_dsmij26	0	*	Really though, wouldn't you name your major sports team after something awesome , or to honor the people that live/lived there?    Houston Texans, NE Patriots, Jacksonville Jaguars, Chicago Bears 
t1_dsmx8j3	0	*	Thanks for feeding me the Democrats highlights of the GOP.    I bet you ignore the fact the GOP is the original progressive party. No room for that narrative Im sure. 
t1_dsmv96r	0	*	Huh? Both Australia and the UK, from what I can tell, use it similarly. Before sporting events and at official events and such. It's not that much different from Canada either.
t1_dsn27yh	1	*	Hurts so goodly.
t1_dsmzbzu	1	*	Which would make them cousins of the Saxons, would it not?
t1_dsmk19z	0	*	So you finally agree the UK has a constitution. Well done. You got there in the end.
t1_dsuh1ix	0	*	You have good points, which are obscured by the fact that you come off as a dick. Thanks for that?
t1_dsp04q2	1	*	Well since you put it like that, I feel like an asshole.

t1_dsmqp68	0	*	> Cant have another red scare, though  Oh, but a Trumpster told me that investigating Russia's interference in the 2016 election is the real Red Scare!
t1_dsmzpp7	1	*	Wow, glad I subscribed to MichaelMalloyFacts
t1_dsmo8hw	1	*	I don't even think Chris Christie likes Chris Christie. 
t1_dsml1lf	0	*	See you're trying too hard. I was giving your some friendly advice and that's your response. You must be new to the troll game. 
t1_dsn4gco	0	*	Theyre wearing fucking pussy hats. The reason for the ridicule is self evident.
t1_dsn57mu	1	*	Yeah, you're right that's actually probably the best part of this.
t1_dsmp9vn	1	*	Yeah, a real gay frog would have told him his eyebrows need work. 
t1_dsng3wb	0	*	Wut.  That's not what I said at all.
t1_dsmyftv	0	*	What are you on about? I assume this was sarcastic?
t1_dsmn8he	0	*	Where are you getting these figures from?
t1_dsmep1w	0	*	Man that would be noisy
t1_dsn3pwg	1	*	Erm...
t1_dsmja8k	1	*	Not even close but thanks for playing
t1_dsmn7e5	0	*	You...  Uh...    You do know white priviledge is made up...    Right?
t1_dsn2gs4	0	*	Why dont you go take a nap progs?  Come back with a fresh start.
t1_dsmjfkg	0	*	Well, it ran away now. 
t1_dsn1a07	1	*	True, but since Parliament controls the line of succession, someone like that would be disqualified before they got the chance to become monarch hopefully.
t1_dsnp47v	1	*	I'll take your word for it.
t1_dsmus0p	1	*	That wasn't even remotely the same as Grenada or St Lucia, but your agenda is simply american history must be the correct one lol
t1_dsmo4ye	0	*	Hold on, you thought he was referring to the *ordinary* liberals? I thought it was pretty obvious he was generalising liberals based just on what the obviously racist ones were saying.
t1_dsmrs1a	0	*	Not fuck the troops, fuck the military industrial complex!
t1_dsmjgy9	0	*	Druid, summons will get you far if you use them right, and they can heal.  get a lock of everyone's hair for reincarnation because people will die. 
t1_dsmzkyp	0	*	Yet you took the time to answer me and still won't respond to the point the other user made.
t1_dsmswn5	0	*	This is very interesting thank you for references Ill read this in bed later 
t1_dsmuib0	1	*	The Redskins are in DC
t1_dsmjjwq	1	*	Ooo that sounds so interesting. What other worlds did you discover?
t1_dsn0uhf	1	*	 I think you're confused. The independent is NOT associated with Murdoch. It's owned by Sultan Muhammad Abuljadayel, Alexander Lebedev and Evgeny Lebedev.

t1_dsmd982	1	*	>Your system is broken. You can't  just walk in and get any surgery at any time!  Little high with that bar, don't yah think?
t1_dsmtbz5	1	*	My bad, its hard to tell around here these days haha. 
t1_dsntsic	1	*	muslims wear turban-like things, but it's cultural. e.g. [this](http://www.dw.com/image/19257260_303.jpg)
t1_dsmq60y	1	*	Ja, my refrigerator is running avay from ze kitchen; it is terrified of ze oven!
t1_dsmyjil	0	*	Don't the myths predate those stories? I mean that's kind of like in 1500 years we say vampires were invented by Bram Stoker, isn't it?
t1_dsmrwg4	0	*	My parents were never denied a bank loan or the ability to live in a decent neighborhood because of the color of their skin, so I've got that going for me, which is pretty nice.
t1_dsmmxvp	0	*	I like how all 3 of the reddit comments you've ever made are all in this thread! 
t1_dsms53o	0	*	I just don't think socialism works. Maybe on a state level but the USA is too big
t1_dsot6a6	0	*	You're embarrassing yourself. Communists and Socialists were the earliest victims of Nazism. Hitler got into power by being a populist and a nationalist. So did Trump by the way.
t1_dsmt6g3	1	*	Umu Vult
t1_dsokyfx	0	*	So I should not be proud of my father for all his accomplishments he worked so hard for in his life, simply because I had no part in it? 
t1_dsmm2vx	0	*	You failed to mention the almighty blimp. What could go wrong with a German blimp?
t1_dsmtnne	0	*	How?
t1_dsu6t6x	0	*	Anyone who thinks this guy is a white supremacist probably lacks critical thinking skills so I wouldnt bother with him lol
t1_dsmmw2r	1	*	Ya, it is pretty fucking stupid.
t1_dsn6p7m	0	*	happy cakeday <3
t1_dsnfidl	0	*	I just took a gander and it really doesn't seem serious, are you sure it's not a meme pit anymore?
t1_dsmp1e2	0	*	What the fuck, Japan?
t1_dsmpy7u	0	*	Sad, if you change a few names here or there. This old cool aid has the same taste, an effect, as the nightly dose one gets on the Telly today doesn't it
t1_dsor06w	0	*	Ask a more clear question.
t1_dsmpm7b	0	*	Youre being vague - keep it simple for me then, stable genius; define hurting someones feelings please 
t1_dsmsklz	0	*	So what's the difference between an uncodified constitution and not having a constitution then?  Because according to that link no country doesn't have a constitution, only an uncodified one.
t1_dsmiwo3	0	*	What if you are intentionally falling off a wall to elbow drop an orc?  That's what one of my players did last time I ran a similar game?  
t1_dsmnzhb	0	*	Taken by the French is not even close to the same as achieving lasting independence.
t1_dsmm1w2	0	*	Don't forget shovels, catapults, etc.
t1_dsmf48i	1	*	Gotta view it through The Lens of Social Justice, which says everything is racist. 
t1_dsmnojj	0	*	Yes, I am. 
t1_dsmri8f	1	*	well you are very fortunate.
t1_dsmuxgf	0	*	Im not from Scotland actually! Just visited and loved it and everyone was very insistent I had to try it. U0001f602
t1_dsn33ft	0	*	Yeah I just read about that. But it's not really a problem because they've opted to scrap them for the sake of inclusiveness :) Works for me. 
t1_dso2nn1	0	*	That's not what you said, what you said was cleaners contain more, which makes sense doesn't it considering they're made to kill germs, not be palatable.
t1_dsn2u7p	1	*	Also we'll arrest teachers at a school board meeting.
t1_dsmjrs4	0	*	This is not what whataboutism is. You can't just drop buzzwords to try and win arguments, my friend. 
t1_dsmdm7r	1	*	Every system rations care. Europe does it based on need, the US does it based on money.
t1_dsmxvyo	0	*	Oh fair enough, I misread what you were asking sorry.
t1_dsn55bm	1	*	Primus sucks
t1_dsmu4gr	1	*	Time will kill the Boomers, thank God, but Y'all Qaeda and the Nazis aren't going anywhere until we force them to.
t1_dsmlgf6	0	*	Please, were sinking!!
t1_dsn31i8	0	*	Yeah man the start of a movement that has taken down hundreds of powerful sexual predators is liberal dumbassery. What kind of effort do you have to go through to justify your idiotic views?
t1_dsmrt4o	0	*	Uhhhh, you are definitely mixing some stuff up here. The pussy hats were for the women's march. It was not an anti-fascist protest. 
t1_dsmjnhn	1	*	Something with high dex, high con, and spider climb. Also a lot of hit points
t1_dsnxt6b	0	*	You are being willfully ignorant or disingenuous.
t1_dsmsyvg	0	*	Yeah, the US certainly has a way of disguising racism and classism underneath the guise of freedom.
t1_dsmr3bf	0	*	So? He is right-wing then. Being part of the Democratic party doesn't automatically make you left-wing. In fact, there was a time where it meant the opposite. 
t1_dsocw9t	0	*	>made up name. Made up figure.  They're not made up. They exist. My comment pointed that out. The fucking state of your reading comprehension.
t1_dsn27y4	0	*	Sadly we do not have a wizard in the party :( but its are first game back from Christmas so it should be a good one! 
t1_dsnhqbb	0	*	I don't recall losing anything. And if by won you mean came in second place, then sure.
t1_dsmkq64	1	*	I think we may have just missed each others points is all.  I think he misread what I wrote and I misread what he wrote. 
t1_dsnqldk	1	*	yea Khan being attacked by right wing scum. the right wing is a plague on humanity.
t1_dsmikmb	0	*	Something you dont get too emotionally attached to.
t1_dsmrqzj	1	*	Yes, Hitler did make claims like that, and then didn't actually enact socialist policy. You may want to look at some other sources than just this one...
t1_dsn2gs6	1	*	That sounds fun, I'll check it out
t1_dsmzn3j	0	*	> you're overestimating your comments as well. they dont add much to the discussion either  I'm not creating a top level comment in an attempt to be an edgy try-hard though, am I?
t1_dsn1w69	1	*	Very well thought out argument there. 
t1_dsoffqj	0	*	Yeah i forgot, they switched so now its just democrats enslaving the poor and minorities via promises of money and food in exchange for votes.
t1_dsmx5ep	1	*	Yeah it's important to make this distinction, associating hating on a religion with racism can make them infallible. I think Christopher Hitchens made a similar point a few years ago. 
t1_dsnmbdt	0	*	An argument presumes some kind of reasonable logic.   You're just justifying bigotry.
t1_dsmmdlf	1	*	Nice.
t1_dsml2li	1	*	Someone with Dimension Door or Teleport.
t1_dsmpnzb	0	*	Love you! I welcome you with open arms.
t1_dsnkqk4	0	*	people don't want literal nazi rallies in their towns, how hard is this to understand? 
t1_dsmpupw	1	*	Sure, you can believe that but really all of your statements have been around the lines of that. I believe this even though I cant validate it.   Which isnt exactly healthy. 
t1_dsn1725	0	*	You're calling them anecdotes to imply it doesn't happen.  Because if you admitted how much dumb shit soros gets blamed for you know it torpedoes your argument.
t1_dsmm2x3	0	*	Do you have direct experience for comparison? Never mind, dont answer that....lol
t1_dsmyli0	0	*	Those people exist in very short supply and yet the right would have you believe that everyone on the left holds those beliefs.
t1_dsml4cn	0	*	The Queen's Speech is still written on goatskin.
t1_dsnd2kd	1	*	Haha your post was hilarious and intricate, well done
t1_dsmeci2	1	*	Crazy isn't it /s
t1_dsriih3	0	*	If your spedometer only checked your speed once in a while it woudnt be representative. Shouldnt the government be representative or at least find out whether it is or not?
t1_dsn0rix	1	*	If he'd had happier little trees, world history could've been very different. 
t1_dsmz8v7	1	*	Only the 'whipping boy' politicians and blatant masochists go on it.
t1_dsmzt6y	0	*	If only Bob Ross was around in 1935..
t1_dsmlydk	1	*	Ugh... who gave me the number for US instead of Germany?
t1_dsn2u31	1	*	He was refused because he couldnt draw people.

t1_dsnt0i0	0	*	it does to christians   look at the IRA, they killed more british nationals than ISIS could ever dream of 
t1_dsmdv2h	0	*	Not even remotely similar but keep going with ridiculous strawman arguments if it makes you feel better.
t1_dsmwrfe	0	*	Better then what we used to be? America is horribly divided right now 
t1_dsn1agy	1	*	........
t1_dsnrvwz	0	*	I hate Islam, not Muslims. #MAGA
t1_dsn1b7b	0	*	Can confirm, not owned by Murdoch. I think you're right in that they sensationalize their headlines, but they're most definitely not the worst offender for that in the UK. 
t1_dsmmsm1	0	*	Wait, are you pretending that racism isn't a thing? What magical bubble do you live in? 
t1_dsn15lb	0	*	Sorry to hear that you too are in a bubble.
t1_dso5rc7	1	*	Thanks (in the US as least) goes to Disney Inc., for this continual parade of ignorance.
t1_dsn406d	1	*	Look for an albino dude with a dragon helmet.  Sounds like he lost his.
t1_dsnl9ir	1	*	that isnt what they mean
t1_dsmk6p5	1	*	*Well, better invest in some ovens too!*
t1_dsn0ah7	0	*	Lol no. The most extreme/right wing version of capitalism goes to the Austrians like Murray Rothbard and Hans Hermann Hoppe. A centrally planned economy is literally the opposite of capitalism
t1_dsmjocx	1	*	A gnome. So you can enjoy watching it die.
t1_dsmokq0	1	*	Yea, that's my point. /r/racky seems to think that admitting that they are both bad is the same as believing they are the same.
t1_dsmtmbg	1	*	yeah it's basically identical to a Jewish yarmukle/yamaka or skullcap. In some Muslim communities it's a bit bigger than the Jewish godhat
t1_ds1slee	1	*	>you don't fuck with the world's best pancake accompanying condiment economy  As a Canadian, this makes me beam with pride :)

t1_dv1pmjz	0	*	Its not and it sorta sucks.   But government has always had the power to do shit like this.

t1_dt0yng6	1	*	I agree.  Im not usually a fan of the death penalty, but I actually think this lady deserves whats coming to her.  I was just pointing out a generality.  
t1_dt0yja4	0	*	Its definitely not. The moment you join a foreign terrorist organisation on foreign soil you wave all your rights for protection from your Home country. They arent responsible for her protection. 
t1_dt0q5xf	1	*	Yours too. We are all brothers and sisters.
t1_dt1625c	1	*	I don't like this reasoning because it removes a lot of context. Killing innocent people isn't the same thing as killing people who kill innocent people.

t1_dug37w6	0	*	Nowhere does it say that all refugees and immigrants should be welcomed unconditionally. 
t1_dugcx4r	0	*	No, truly unjust laws should not be upheld before they have a chance to be changed. The rules are the rules is not ethical justification.

t1_dugx7fq	0	*	The wall was a symbol of imprisonment. The important change was a change in government.
t1_dugan1l	0	*	No - you said you don't bother yourself with politics. If you can't be fucking bothered to read the news occasionally and stay informed, then you shouldn't be fucking voting on anything.
t1_dugbp8o	0	*	Hm, but what about brown people moving to Texas or California, where they most definitely were before the Mexican American war?
t1_dugenl7	0	*	These are economic migrants, not refugees. Israel has accepted a huge % of its populations as refugees. Far more than America or Europe.   I'm trying to fool you? You just lied about sterilisation. 
t1_dug1loe	0	*	Oh I just noticed its you. We went over this in other threads, I'll pass.
t1_dugykgh	1	*	Israel was founded on the idea of a state for the Jewish people, so yes. Most countries in the world are classified as ethnostates. Including every country that surrounds Israel. 
t1_duhckmg	0	*	You are rscist. You ignore facts. If you can't just admit that then you're a pussy
t1_dug0t4z	0	*	so the middle eastern jews that were kicked out of their countries can go to europe, but the european jews that were kicked out of their countries can't go to the ME?

t1_dsb96ii	1	*	Im glad some people still remember the value of accurate historical facts.  Ironic.
t1_dt0b5c2	1	*	  your original comment was that Israelis act like animals to an article which literally has zero content. I probably should've replied to that one.
t1_dt08yep	1	*	I dont need to make a defense. My statement stands. Israel has no reputation to smear.  The shitty behavior of the state of israel is well documented and proven.

t1_dskk7up	1	*	Well, coupled with the other shit Trump has spewed, it really isnt that far fetched that race could play a role. 
t1_dskpcof	1	*	Why, we're all equally effected by the President's actions, we should all have an equal say in who becomes presidents.
t1_dskm5tw	0	*	You failed to answer anything I said and made a pointless comment
t1_dskst36	0	*	Exactly, we never realized we could hit 3% and higher growth, and I thought for sure the stock market would flatten out with QE ending, but nope. What a time to be alive. 
t1_dsknewl	1	*	Also, changes in unemployment doesn't happen that fast, what we see now in America has been brewing for a while. Once the changes Trump HAS made settles well be bale to see the effects of Trump. 
t1_dsknm4l	1	*	Each state has their own income tax rate. Some states don't have any California charges up to 13% on top of the federal taxes.

t1_dsmlkoo	1	*	Much appreciated.
t1_dskp327	0	*	You have still failed to address the question. Trump Laid out a 100 day action plan. That plan was not accomplished. If that has not been accomplished then he failed to fulfill his campaign promises.
t1_dskrm00	1	*	They try their hardest not to. Tbh tax avoidation isnt hard when all the politicians are bought and paid. 
t1_dskn9yz	1	*	Youre right Im sorry I forgot to take into account third party votes. I was thinking you meant not a majority of the population because so many didnt vote but I was incorrect.
t1_dskobrr	1	*	Honestly, voting only matters if you live in a swing state.

t1_dskof3c	1	*	Not voting will always give fanatics of some sort more power. Those that are true believers will always make sure to vote for their guy and if the participation is low enough, they'll win
t1_dslvhxf	0	*	Hmm... unemployment is not 46% in America... ? Do I need to space the sentences out so you can read it slower? 
t1_dskkfzk	0	*	Wait, so you agree that they're not shithole countries? Well that was easy.
t1_dskm8od	1	*	Two party system doesn't help voter apathy, though. 
t1_dskpeig	0	*	Except we know the population demographics, those who are working (taxes), and those who aren't similarly.   It's very pretty simple albeit tedious and why we do assign numbers to it 
t1_dsknot9	1	*	It was a good idea at the time. No one could have predicted the American political landscape 200 years in the future.
t1_dskrtn6	0	*	I know, but it wont stop the richest from paying less. 
t1_dskkq5l	1	*	Absolutely. And now we have both Western and Eastern exploitation of Africa.   All the natural resources are leaving the continent and barely returning any buying power to the population.

t1_dss2nt2	1	*	Just the kind of answer I was expecting/hoping for   ...eh. 
t1_dt2yj6k	1	*	That's the thing. That parade isn't really about you. Its like, they want to go outside and feel good about themselves for a day. They don't want to have to be  afraid.

t1_dtzocgt	1	*	And it's good for the environment.  That's what really convinced me. Also then found out about the animal abuse crap. 
t1_du0atxt	0	*	So you're ok with animal abuse as long as you get 5 minutes of taste pleasure?

t1_dtztd7q	0	*	No they are not. Eating meat is not the same as saying animals should live like this. It's just not.   There is a difference between a good farm and a bad farm. Are you saying there is not?

t1_dtzqrjf	0	*	You have a really narrow view of vegetarians if you think they only eat salad. They have as much variety in their diet as you do, it's just filled with different stuff.
t1_du0vbxa	1	*	That must be the logic, I believe it is a cultural thing, but I am not sure being a none American and I guess that is why I think it is quite insane.

t1_du0vxmt	0	*	the vast majority of crop farming is used to feed animals used in meat consumption. Eliminating meat from our diet means far less veggie farms are needed.  Now watch the carnists lose their shit.

t1_dtzjlgz	1	*	Just keep in eye on how you feel, mate. Keeping a journal isn't a bad idea if you're into that sort of thing.  Best part of a plant-based diet? amazing poops EVERY TIME
t1_dtzyhx2	0	*	Animals likely do not have a will to live, only a will to avoid unpleasant stimuli. I doubt animals can even understand the concept of death, certainly not as deeply as intelligent humans do. 
t1_dtzxwmb	1	*	I've actually read that article before, and it is full of errors and flawed reasoning. I'd suggest getting your information from a better source.
t1_du0aaat	1	*	And you can and many people do get all the nutrition that you need from a diet without meat. Saying that you need meat in your diet is factually incorrect. Including meat in your diet is a choice. 
t1_dtzvpqw	0	*	What about really fucking dumb people, can we eat those? Like don't know how to read or tie their own shoelaces? Because there are animals that are basically smarter than those people.

t1_dtzwr3g	0	*	This would require a much longer conversation, but morals are not subjective. I dont have to energy to go into it right now, but even though not one person decides, theyre still not up to belief.
t1_du0e39x	1	*	That's an oversimplification. Neither may be absolute solutions but one is making much more progress than the other. We should do our best to deal with factory farming as much as possible.
t1_dtzk8wa	1	*	Interesting. I'm hoping it takes off, I do eat meat but buy organic / free range, and at least 50% of my meals are vegetarian (not including breakfast). I believe that industrial farming is wrong.

t1_dtzwzix	0	*	how much rice and beans are you going to eat?   
t1_dtzrfga	1	*	While this is partially true, it is up to the consumer to choose what they eat. Some people weirdly enjoy high-octane garbage.
t1_dtznw5e	0	*	Then we could just not breed them into existence in the first place?

t1_dtnetn3	1	*	It's true
t1_dtnakfr	0	*	FISA MEMO IS A FUCKING MEMO
t1_dtn6awx	0	*	I'm just saying, it's been done before. If it proves problematical that the Republicans stole a seat on the court, it could be remedied by a future hypothetical Dem government. 
t1_dtn8s9o	1	*	yes, thanks
t1_dtnisl6	1	*	What a time to be alive!
t1_dtnkmil	1	*	That fact that Wikileaks only 'leaks' stuff that helps the GOP is reason enough alone to be unreliable.
t1_dtnncdm	1	*	Gotcha. Sounds like it's a multi-agency failure. Hooray!
t1_dtnbcm2	0	*	> The Ukraine is actually pretty good example of this.  Just a slight nitpick, but Ukrainians *hate it* when people put The in front of Ukraine. It's just *Ukraine*.
t1_dtn72rt	1	*	that is a big IF
t1_dtnhc7g	1	*	The warrant was already in place. The memo selectively picks information to supports its narrative. That is why it is refuted by virtually everybody except Devin and Donald. 
t1_dtncanp	1	*	The FBI has never had a Democrat as their director.
t1_dtnda2x	1	*	that's a good comment  and not at all what i was responding to before
t1_dto1jnt	1	*	But theyre not letting anyone see this information or the Democratic response or the FBI/DOJ response.  Doesnt that ring alarm bells?
t1_dtole8o	1	*	Idk? Because I chose to ask that was I guess. Wasnt supposed to be rude. If you think its annoying thats fine with me, idc lol

t1_dtn5b0o	0	*	which will ultimately only hurt the russian working class, what a great plan
t1_dtnsmn2	1	*	Agreed. If Steele lied to the FBI and the FBI continued to use his information after they knew he lied, someone should at least lose their job.
t1_dtnaheb	1	*	Yao guai*
t1_dtnboks	0	*	Why are you trying so hard to argue with this guy?  He gave a pretty genuine/neutral answer and you're just trying to push him into fighting you. I don't get it.
t1_dtnczhh	1	*	Really wrinkles the ol' brain walnut, huh?
t1_dtnxryt	0	*	It's not about not believing it, it's that that is not what the memo portrays.  Not believing implies that there is no evidence either way.
t1_dtn8uub	1	*	> what are the citizens going to do against them?  Do what people have done since time immemorial.  Sharpen the guillotines. 
t1_dtp3off	0	*	Well now we're splitting hairs, because the difference between a disruptive and a non-disruptive protest are entirely subject.

t1_dtnee27	1	*	Okay. But is there any way you could let us know which congressman/senator has the fake tooth? My money's on Nunes. 
t1_dtn5byk	0	*	not impeachable offense. Obama allowed states to legalize marijuana while there was a federal law outlawing it. by this standard, every president would be impeached.

t1_dtnjv7o	1	*	15 percent of Philadelphia is also wearing zoobas right now. Connection? 
t1_dtpb3gc	0	*	How does Nunes know they lied if he hasn't read the FISA application? The memo simply fails to establish any clear link between the dossier and the start of the investigation.
t1_dtn179g	0	*	as long as it takes  what is your point? give up?
t1_dtnk3qz	0	*	Shut that shit down?  Are you really advocating a coup d'xe9tat ?  E: fixed the French, thanks

t1_dtrln5d	0	*	Really you can't say anything better than that?
t1_dto112y	1	*	What is getting started? All this memo is saying is that the FBI took information from someone who was being paid to dig up information.

t1_dtnykwq	1	*	Wait? What are you even saying?
t1_dtnckhe	0	*	Pretend whichever you want. Doesn't bother me. I would just like to see some evidence of your claims.

t1_dtnd6tn	1	*	I just read it. Can Congress declassify FISA court records? I should would like to know exactly what the FBI thought they had on Carter Page.
t1_dtnllxq	1	*	Nah they're now funnelled through Stormy Daniels
t1_dtn94vm	0	*	I do indeed see trump and his red hats as fascists, because they are: https://theswamp.media/the-fourteen-points-of-fascism-and-our-president
t1_dtncl42	1	*	But you whole sale believe what Trump and the repubs are saying in this memo when they have provided no incontrovertible proof? 
t1_dtnc8mo	1	*	I don't agree with him on some foreign policy issues, but as far as every domestic issue goes he's great. There are very few people who support all the same things he does
t1_dtndejo	0	*	You said war, not formally declared war.
t1_dtns5p9	1	*	Without local cooperation. They are allowed to operate on US soil with permission from local authorities.

t1_dtavg9m	1	*	You must've meant to reply too the same person I did.
t1_dsva669	0	*	it is perfectly legal tax avoidance as far as I know, it was when it was being funnelled to Ireland, I don't see why it wouldn't be now. 
t1_dsw8zxb	1	*	Well you weren't wrong, in real life you would use the mode and median with the average to find out that people generally have 2 legs, but some people have fewer.
t1_dtmr7fu	0	*	So wait, you're saying that Cuban refugees in the modern age are pro-Batista reactionaries and plantation owners?
t1_dtnd1mc	1	*	You must be mentally handicapped to reach that conclusion after what I said, I just stated when slavery was abolished.
t1_dtn7myd	0	*	Everybody who works in Cuba profits from Castro.
t1_dtn4ig9	0	*	Owning people would get more attention from the government than an illegal plant.
t1_dtmw96w	1	*	Im not saying that at all.  I said the parties have to be allowed by the PCC.    Edited: lets not forget that these secondary parties cant campaign and dont have political free speech.
t1_dt8cpp0	1	*	Which part? Who here is a protestant?
t1_du1wvjk	0	*	I'm aware that eggs produce more waste. What does that have to with what I said? Substituting plastic pollution with agricultural pollution is retarded lol
t1_dtx818o	0	*	We do it for peace others do it for power. - Citizens of every imperialist power . 
t1_dtyqiu4	1	*	 I think you need to re-read my commentor again, you've completely misinterpreted my point.  Also, I'm from Pakistan, so I can tell you right now, I actually do know what they say.

t1_dtjf7at	0	*	I personally believe it's better to respond to an attack rather than start one.
t1_dtjl8pg	0	*	If you marched with Neonazis, you're not a good person.  I don't give a shit about their political views, they still had the choice to march or not and made their choice.

t1_dv2z55m	1	*	He never once mentioned Jews...
t1_dv2x4mq	0	*	US banks provided majority of loans to Germany to make payment son the war debt. 
t1_dv2raxl	1	*	so you're part of the Black Hand then? or an Austrian that migrated to Germany?
t1_dv44k1c	1	*	Oh, I didn't see that you are a 4 days old troll account.  FU and crawl back under your bridge.

t1_dutpaoq	0	*	The interesting thing here is that you're calling me a Russian bot, but your punctuation indicates that you aren't even from the United States.
t1_dute5wj	0	*	Poorly
t1_dt8njfw	0	*	Im not saying they are the capital. Just more than I imagined for that type of culture. A lot of real serious hippie types. I lived there and worked for years. 
t1_dt8ng1a	1	*	It would be Das deutsche Volk because Volk is neuter and you have a definite article requiring the weak declension. The capitalisation could be excused if it were titling case...
t1_dt7x7oq	0	*	They're working on it, but fusion [power]'s hard.
t1_dt7yz5q	1	*	Make the feather duster vibrate. Program frequent spin cycles that using centrifugal forces to remove sand from the duster.   There's always a solution, but we probably are no longer being efficient.

t1_dt7y6zj	0	*	But the mechanisms mechanism probably gets sand in it :(
t1_dt83oza	1	*	> vastly devastating catastrophies every few decades.  Except fukushima wasn't that, and chernobyl was at the height of the cold war under a regime that barely held itself together?
t1_dt9ayb8	1	*	 The people who fell for the tobacco lies are mostly dead now. 
t1_dt8cucy	1	*	It works, but it's not done on a large scale yet. The point is that making solar panels will *always* generate lots of waste and damage the environment, whereas nuclear/uranium doesn't have to.
t1_dt8ngiu	1	*	It would be Das deutsche Volk because Volk is neuter and you have a definite article requiring the weak declension. The capitalisation could be excused if it were titling case...
t1_dt7w573	1	*	>Edit: cooling towers are pretty damn high. You don't think people can fall off them constructing those?  They probably do, but you have to install millions of solar panely for each cooling tower. 
t1_dt96fwo	1	*	I doubt you'd manage to win a lawsuit after such egregious malpractice at least.
t1_dt7x1yr	1	*	Wendover Production talks about it in his video [The Nuclear Waste Problem](https://youtu.be/uU3kLBo_ruo?t=347) 
t1_dt81gsp	1	*	Where my experience comes from as well.   I just took a fucking shower and my arms are still dirty!
t1_dt7y05j	0	*	Chill out dude. Questioning the ethics of nuclear waste doesn't make me pro-coal. There are other renewable sources of energy. Presuming that I don't give a fuck about pollution is a bit unfair, no?  
t1_dt7worm	0	*	No, not really. Solar wins easily in long-term deployment solutions and in decentralized grid solutions.
t1_dt8hh50	1	*	Hillary wasn't my candidate.
t1_dt86c9s	1	*	Or, perhaps, you're just clinging to a whole lot of racist, pseudo-science bullshit.
t1_dt8kqh9	1	*	World Health Organization for the lower estimates. I have never seen an estimate above 30 000 deaths from a legitimate source (peer-reviewed study). 
t1_dt8a1dt	1	*	Let them eat yellow cake! 
t1_dt7ys5a	0	*	STILL not really seeing the immense danger.  Is your position that they should increase security at nuclear plants and then they can shut the coal plants?  ??????
t1_dt7w254	1	*	I work in nuclear industry, and I'd happily put our accident / OHS casualty rate against wind, solar or hydro per MWh produced.  
t1_dt7zera	1	*	Depends on how you value that the planet doesn't go to shit.
t1_dt95q8u	0	*	Notably, literally no one has directly died because of the meltdown, which makes any death due to fear of the meltdown a fatal overreaction caused by a hysterical media.
t1_dt87oix	1	*	Oh god no. 
t1_dt8h9nv	1	*	not sure youre from the us.  Nobody rigged the primaries, thats literally not how primaries work.
t1_dt8mtsn	0	*	Also, Noice.  cause climate change...  
t1_dt7w3tk	0	*	>well they should count as work security related death, not solar panels problems.  if installing solar *necessitates* this problem then it they are caused by choosing solar over nuclear.
t1_dt8ijr8	1	*	Facts doesnt have a chance when feelings are involved. For the greater populous nuclear is nuclear and goes boom.
t1_dt8avqr	1	*	Not only this, but Trump parroted clean coal, while the rest of everyone notices this is a bad idea.  It's only a bipartisan issue because he's making it one. 
t1_dt7yy7c	1	*	They're going to keep going. /s
t1_dt7xdb4	0	*	Of course it doesn't make any sense. But do you really think the average voter cares? It's nuclear stuff, and the green party said nuclear stuff is gonna kill us all, so make it go away.
t1_dt7wzdh	0	*	You definitely can bake a cake and eat it too.  Why wouldn't that be possible.   ^^^unless ^^^im ^^^missing ^^^a ^^^pun. ^^^in ^^^that ^^^case: ^^^sorry.
t1_dt8lhsr	1	*	Greenpeace is admittedly anti nuclear. This is not a report by scientists. Its propaganda.
t1_dt8o9ue	0	*	You probably shouldn't use groups like Carbon Industry Against Nuclear Power for your information. 
t1_dt8y967	1	*	Fusion still creates low-level nuclear waste, so it's not entirely harmless, but it's sure as hell safer than where most of our power comes from now
t1_dt84mxx	0	*	Mmmmm, there's only a bit of piss in this water, it's not catastrophic! If you don't think Fukushima was disastrous for the oceans I don't know what to tell you. 
t1_dt80p7z	1	*	Looks even nice if you put a bunch of trees there, but it'll still take a very long time to get any of the eco-system back that you destroyed.
t1_dt7zz61	1	*	And he creates jobs. Well done!
t1_dt9m3se	1	*	He said cheaper not faster 
t1_dt7zcv7	0	*	Sure. Here is a Nat Geo article:  https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2014/11/141111-solar-panel-manufacturing-sustainability-ranking/

t1_dt9wfg6	1	*	Dude, I'm from France. And how am I 'narrow minded' for thinking that the president sucks? 
t1_dt8x0e3	1	*	The city isn't really that radioactive, but the remnants of the reactor will be pretty hot for a very long time
t1_dt7y59k	0	*	Yes that's where the carbon release numbers come from. Methane is included in that as a carbon-equivalent number. 
t1_dt832gg	1	*	If you go that way wind and solar (but mostly wind) also have a noticeable impact on the fauna. 
t1_dt7z981	1	*	I only eat glowing cake.  
t1_dt8g4er	1	*	Right on. Radioactive waste is much easier to deal with than toxic waste, however. Containment is key, and it's impossible to contain the waste from the use of fossil fuels. 
t1_dt7yvr7	1	*	I didn't say it's rational, but people conflate fusion and fission, it's not my fault people are uneducated after nuclear energy is used as a political leverage.
t1_dt7yh38	1	*	No reasonable person could argue with that, i agree 100%
t1_dt84ns6	1	*	Damn. I had a vision of hundreds of computer fans per solar panel keeping off little amounts of dust per fan. This is why I'm not an engineer. 
t1_dt9kral	1	*	You see, you keep with those feelings. Just stop. 
t1_dt7xx09	1	*	Of course it doesn't make any sense. But do you really think the average voter cares? It's nuclear stuff, and the green party said nuclear stuff is gonna kill us all, so make it go away.
t1_dt82mq3	1	*	I can't remember which article I read about it. There are a lot though. There's a field of study about it called nuclear semiotics
t1_dt88noh	1	*	Nothing about the US voting system is fair. Not with the gerrymandering, not with people trying to get to the voting booths and being denied access.
t1_dt9mjj4	1	*	It looked like it was out of Aliens. 
t1_dt7xvca	0	*	I live in the immediate vicinity of a hydropower plant and theres a nature sanctuary right next to the plant.
t1_dt86v09	1	*	Those Facts don't matter, it has the word Nuclear and people are scared. Bow your head and join our green campaign of more coal production instead of evil nuclear.
t1_dt7vto1	1	*	Straw man.  How many m^2 of solar panel produces the amount of energy of one typical nuclear plant?
t1_dt87wdm	1	*	like what, name me one energy source with zero detrimental environmental impact. 
t1_dt852i5	1	*	You can do the same with nuclear waste.  It is not done mainly for political reasons.
t1_dt8p6o6	1	*	Yeah, and natural uranium is 0.7% enriched iirc. U235 is still extremely uncommon and it takes many times natural abundance to be useful
t1_dt7z2vf	1	*	This is the quality content I come to Reddit for. 
t1_dt82ng3	1	*	Fusion won't happen due to economics. Renewables+storage will be significantly cheaper than fusion.
t1_dt7wxtw	0	*	Back in my day the dude with the axe was the reactor.     Living in a shoebox on the side of the road, splitting atoms with his axe all day long.
t1_dt7vpvb	0	*	What do you mean by wrong numbers? As far as I am aware it is a generally accepted fact that nuclear energy is one of the least lethal sources of energy both directly and indirectly.
t1_dt8zegc	1	*	That's what I was thinking. 
t1_dt8jds3	1	*	But it has the word 'nuclear' in it which makes it sound scary.
t1_dt9q8xp	0	*	> With no regulations we get coal everywhere.  Cut all subsidies. Subsidies = free taxpayer money/funds. Also, no tax cuts.   Keep the regulations. 
t1_dt7wz9e	0	*	Its the Soviet Union - of course it was a disaster. Building and safety codes were nowhere near what American Nuclear Power Plants would have to be. 
t1_dt85cen	0	*	a lot of it has to do with storage cost as well
t1_dt7ywse	0	*	I don't know if you meant to correct me, if you did: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_can%27t_have_your_cake_and_eat_it
t1_dt7z6q8	0	*	Vast majority of people who are anti-nuclear are also anti-coal, though.
t1_dt8l2tu	0	*	No, it's because the US is a nation governed by lobbying money.
t1_dt9mjec	1	*	It looked like it was out of Aliens. 
t1_dtaco99	0	*	I don't need to know why, but if someone is willing to give me something else in return for my poop, then that makes my poop valuable
t1_dtbfzgk	0	*	If you can't answer the question, you should reconsider your views.  
t1_dtau1bn	0	*	It would be idiotic to use a hard drive for cold storage.  There are various ways to do cold storage and do it securely. Keeping a private key or keys on a hard drive is not one of them.
t1_dtbnrex	1	*	I'm pretty sure automomity is the process of becoming a mom after conception in your womb.
t1_dtatfu0	0	*	People need housing, you know?
t1_dtaezyo	0	*	I'm stealing this.
t1_dtaysxc	0	*	Pretty fuckin' dumb analogy too. The purpose is to facilitate commerce and not get robbed blind for half a billion dollars.
t1_dtb5auj	1	*	Reinsurance is a huge field and it spreads all of the market risk beautifully.
t1_dsqho6m	1	*	That seems like a good analogy to me. But Ill be honest, I dont know wtf Im talking about. I only know what was in the article. 
t1_dst8zgh	0	*	coinmarketcap.com/currencies/power-ledger/
t1_dsqycl8	1	*	Well, it's hard to store a lot of energy with that. The only example would be capacitors I guess.  Mechanical potential energy is basically springs, which doesn't store that much either.
t1_dsqxl1a	1	*	conceptually batteries and capacitors are very very very similar
t1_dspwtpj	1	*	So the tie in was following the script, but the producers (?) dumbed it down... makes sense (or not, but you get my drift).
t1_dsrn3bf	1	*	I didn't know that - the bastards. I really enjoyed that film right up to that point which completely threw me out of the whole thing.  Really needs a cut with this in it.

t1_dsz4tm2	0	*	>All countries do not treat premature births the same.  No but Western nations do, and that's the comparison that matters. 
t1_dsyzxa0	0	*	if you only count the people who don't die as infants, the US has a similar infant mortality rate to the rest of the developed world.
t1_dszhi4y	1	*	It's the *only* measure of obesity in these rankings.  So... 
t1_dsz0tgz	0	*	So what was the point of your ironic Yay free market! comment if the US doesn't have a free market on healthcare? 
t1_dszaoga	0	*	>  if you arent white...  ITT Black Americans shouldn't be classified as people.     Also, would you classify Japan as a western country?

t1_dsz2vwe	1	*	Lol. I'm glad we agree that the current government's efforts to privatise the NHS are bad!
t1_dsz2z2q	0	*	So how much does a Canadian making $50000 a year pay in taxes compared to an American making the same amount?
t1_dsz0n7b	0	*	Lol yeah creating new drugs that save lives not exciting or important - unbelievable

t1_dsyxbss	0	*	Typically when we talk about free markets we mean markets that are free of regulation except for negative externality provisions. 
t1_dsz33ov	1	*	Thank you
t1_dsz0iqu	0	*	So with extending the age to 24 months, we do not have an extremely high mortality rate?
t1_dszphyk	1	*	That means were number one *and* number two!

t1_dt09djm	1	*	And it's not my fault the doctor snipped too much off the tip of your prick. 
t1_dszui8r	1	*	The current Egyptian administration was who ran the Muslim brotherhood out, though. Sure, they are not too liberal themselves, but they are not extremists either.

t1_dsyzmz1	1	*	Yes, that was precisely my point. Thanks for posting. 
t1_dszgvfu	0	*	Part of the issue is people with Masters in applied physics with a thesis rarely work in a high school. That's part of the reason why high schools lack coding courses as well.

t1_dsz1vg2	1	*	Wow /u/realbaster, you must feel stupid after that comment.   Next time try a little Google before making yourself look like an uneducated fool. 
t1_dsz5y35	1	*	Does that control for race?

t1_dtqy251	1	*	Wow! This is really full of shit! Here is your downvote.
t1_dtr6le2	0	*	I totally agree with you, but we are talking about China in 1840, an archaic country under a absolute monarchy, not so similar as a modern country.
t1_dtra12p	0	*	Dont think those international students in questions come here to study in the English department. 
t1_dtqtkwz	0	*	Every statement you made in your comment is incorrect. I hope no one in this thread takes what you say as true.   Source: Work college admissions
t1_dtrzwe3	0	*	That is no longer true though. Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen etc. are as developed and wealthy as HK now.
t1_dtq8l9q	1	*	Interesting. Thanks for clarifying.

t1_dsrethe	0	*	Its not party partisan though. If you lose 1/3 of voters across all parties what does that mean? Nothing. 
t1_dsrcq0j	0	*	I can think of one extremely good reason which is setting a precedent to other EU members; if you leave, you are not getting a sweet deal out of it.
t1_dsrnuqx	0	*	Because the other party was Trump.
t1_dsrfwsm	1	*	you do know that unless the UK signs free trade agreements with those other nations, it has to give the EU EXACTLY the same benefits as it gives poorer countries.  WTO rules.  
t1_dsrcsvc	1	*	Ah now I see. Yes with that I definitely agree.  It's in the EU's best interest to look as the sane one in that negotiation. And the UK seems to do everything to make it so.
t1_dsre3df	0	*	Let me explain it like this a poll is there to show how a population will vote. Currently the majority of people do want a second vote if may fails to get a deal. That is democratic.

t1_dsr5dbw	1	*	Yea a year and a bit.
t1_dsreytq	1	*	Norway have already said that if the UK gets a special deal then -they- want it too.  They are currently one of the few countries in the EEA but outside the EU.

t1_dts046b	0	*	Because you can choose insurances. And you can pay out of pocket as well. Whereas when the government is in control you have to leave the country entirely etc, if they even let you do that. 
t1_dtttu4y	0	*	Every crazy? Got a source on that? Or is it just more over-generalization?
t1_dtt1uif	0	*	China started to succeed once they abandon communism and started to implement capitalism and free market.
t1_dtt7zww	0	*	So you cant work out 30 min a day and eat cheerios instead of donuts for breakfast?  Not to mention if you buy your own groceries you save money and eat healthier.
t1_dtscrzp	0	*	Unless you're referring to nuclear war which again is in fact not out of the realm of possibilities, no that's never been claimed by anyone. 
t1_dttj4b9	1	*	Oh yes, we know what you are like. Don't you worry.
t1_dtsl5dr	0	*	I kinda wish this with people who don't eat right or smoke. At the very least, they should have to pay a premium. 
t1_dtwhutp	1	*	Right, because democrats were the conservative right wing party in the 1800s . . .
t1_dtsinw0	1	*	That's not really a fair comparison
t1_dtso0a3	0	*	Ah, the modern leftist ladies and gentleman. Don't look for data! Just believe what you're told!
t1_dtsyzdq	0	*	Didn't the States classify pizza as a vegetable for schools?
t1_dtt733j	0	*	you know universal healthcare was a GOP idea?  This is false. Perhaps way back in the bygone era. In no scenario in any point in time since 1950 was healthcare ever a GOP idea.
t1_dtsq19g	0	*	No, that's not what he sounds like.  You sound like you are trying to force a narrative. Your conclusion may ultimately be correct, but there's absolutely no reason to be presume his motives.
t1_dtshw00	0	*	The question is not what was the standards at those days but whether people got the best service they could get at the time.
t1_dtrygaf	1	*	And until they happens Im not comfortable with giving politicians that can be influenced by the industry they are supposed to be negotiating with being effective and efficient. 
t1_dtsvpex	1	*	Fair enough, that's a much better comparison.
t1_dtss71r	0	*	But how is that third world tier? Most of us can afford to cough up $100-150 every once in a while when we need to see a doc.

t1_dtswv7e	0	*	Sorry, I disagree with speech regulation so I can't comment on why. I misread your post.
t1_dtti0mu	0	*	Most hate speech can be truly believed. Saying blacks are dumber than whites, for example. They may have read The Bell Curve and really believe that.
t1_dttnmqx	0	*	True but the issue here is Polish assisting nazis

t1_dsi4c5x	0	*	Inconceivable!!

t1_dsi7lw8	0	*	Generally I think that's true, although here's a cool counter example: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikoyan-Gurevich_MiG-25
t1_dsiato2	1	*	So? Haha this is so lame
t1_dspdnbm	0	*	Nope, Trump has business acumen, no matter what people think of him.
t1_dsik5wo	1	*	Yeah did you guys even *see* that mountain the skulls, but of course the property values next to blood Lake are just astronomical.

t1_dsj407h	1	*	Yeah, some people really seem to take it seriously.  I just say what I feel.  It's interesting to see how the comment karma plays out.  
t1_dsiah0x	1	*	Your entire reality is a poorly constructed delusion, and you cult members should expect no tolerance, no appeasement, and no respect because YOUR KIND DESERVE NONE.   Simple enough? Game tf on.    
t1_dsid5sj	1	*	I think you misread, I was saying I didn't inherently hate him but that didn't like whats he's been doing because of it's negative impacts.
t1_dsi84vi	1	*	Additionally, when people say something factual, rational and possibly not even controversial they start by saying Im no fan of trump but...
t1_dsi8clp	0	*	Tell that to my paycheck.
t1_dsitf8i	1	*	Pretending this is a one off thing eh. Let's see how that plays out.
t1_dsic1jc	0	*	Don't try to project you are intellectual dishonesty and love of censorship in the name of safe spaces on me.   Unlike our current president, I'm more than man enough to admit when I'm wrong.   
t1_dsi93xr	0	*	My claim that Michelle could beat Barack? I guess just shoulder width...it was kind of a joke.  I do get why you think i might be serious though. I mean, damn
t1_dsiki10	0	*	Obama didn't claim to have the best words and real good brain. Real smart people don't need to tell everyone. He must have grabbed you real hard by the pussy. 
t1_dsj0d62	1	*	No, it's not.  Forgetting *how* to hold a bottle definitely can be, however.
t1_dsi8c8y	0	*	Surprise surprise, the person that you elect to the position of president is a regular human.

t1_dsi4wr2	0	*	Omg the fact that our community is so much smarter than the leader of the free world just makes my fucking head spin
t1_dsifbhf	1	*	Geniuses can misspeak.  And people who aren't geniuses like Trump also do it. Multiple times. And pretend they didn't.
t1_dsi81vw	0	*	I live in California so my vote is powerless thanks to the electoral college. So I didn't select a presidential candidate.
t1_dsid4dp	1	*	I guess you missed the part where he released all but a dozen or so detainees, and then couldn't get the Republican-controlled congress to fund moving them.
t1_dsi7dpn	1	*	Lol
t1_dsi93e7	0	*	Eh, I don't think he was talking about attacking the US. He was alluding to the fact that most of the Canadian population is way south, near the US border
t1_dsi1z1z	1	*	To be fair, a lot of the things Trump says paints Trump badly.

t1_dsipo7o	1	*	Right ho then.  Hope it is.
t1_dsjnbba	1	*	Are you saying those are good things? Because my entire premise is that those sorts of actions are bad, and Obama adding to the list is bad.
t1_dsibglg	1	*	Too scared to say because you know the poster will point out their mis-speaking
t1_dsj1fly	1	*	I'm sure you would.
t1_dsic477	1	*	Probably, but who would suspect the Finns, especially when the Australians already have such a well-established enmity with the Emus?
t1_dsj0yaq	0	*	Why are *you* not linking your source? Its *your* quote.  Even if the source agreed with the quote, Obama still did not slip up and claim unequal pay for the same job.

t1_dsi6m7s	1	*	I did not do such a thing. In both cases they were gaffes. Nothing more; nothing less 
t1_dsij00b	1	*	Yeah. I wouldn't be a good president. I'm completely unsuited to the job.  Just like Trump.  But unlike Trump I know my limitations.

t1_du0cthx	1	*	Good to point out for sure.  The USSR backed Vietnam and China backed Cambodia.  Its interesting to acknowledge the socialist world had inner strife just like the free market one.
t1_du0izic	1	*	South Korea was getting crushed by the North Korean army AND it's own people before the UN came in. What's your point

t1_dtwwhro	1	*	I really have been meaning to watch that show. Sounds like it might just be my 4am thoughts, televised. Lol
t1_dtwyjsx	0	*	It's pretty funny how your defense of him relies on him being stupid.

t1_dtx2zko	1	*	Minnesotans are very introverted for the most part. Winter really encourages people to make a tight knit group of friends and hunker down most of the time.
t1_dtx7vel	1	*	And then, if votes don't go their way, ignore the voters anyway and pull out Electoral Collage.
t1_dtx4jj7	0	*	so the laws themselves arent racist, just the scum that use them to prevent Democrats from voting.
t1_dtx2ey8	1	*	Thanks for the informative reply. Took notes from this one. You really put it into perspective for me

t1_dtx0bgf	0	*	How are you guys not canadian, eh? 
t1_dtwx5dv	1	*	I mean... The entire system is founded on legalized theft. Would we expect the good of the people to be top priority? 
t1_dtwwcaa	1	*	Read the article. Im not the idiot. No votes were prevented.
t1_dty62fu	0	*	Join the club. We all lose under a trump presidency.
t1_dtx4o2p	0	*	Oh mai did I get bamboozled till that /s
t1_dtyfl5v	1	*	In THIS case, I think they still would have voted Republican because Hilary was THAT disliked. I'd rather they did away with the primary dog and pony show entirely.
t1_dtwsy59	0	*	AIM was just an offshoot of Hydra anyway.   Hail Hydra. 
t1_dtwz2x3	0	*	Why needing leverage in Syria?

t1_dtxgg4o	0	*	They wouldn't be forced to change their political/economic system. Get real.  They'd need to change what they spend their money on, but they wouldn't have to change their system of government.

t1_dtxqgw0	0	*	Youre on a world news sub and the only Muller you want to hear about is a soccer/football player? You might be in the wrong place, bud. Not that anyone believes it after that diatribe though. 
t1_dtx5p23	0	*	>Europe automatically registers its voters and hands out IDs.  Who would know who lives where? There's no national registry.
t1_dtxqdyt	1	*	Yup. Live to work is the norm for most people here.
t1_dtwx1o7	0	*	My senator is Mitch McConnell. Tell me how you expect me to change his mind? Only chance is to vote them out and help their oppositions campaign. Calling your senator isnt going to do shit anymore.

t1_dtwwb5b	1	*	In b4 gilding
t1_dtwwibq	1	*	What makes you say that?
t1_dtxpewb	1	*	You're almost there. It's a voting system designed to keep unauthorized people from voting.
t1_dtx71cv	1	*	You magnificent bastard.  I went and got a glass of water just to have the satisfaction of spitting it out after reading that.  
t1_dtxw254	0	*	Its amazing how mainstream this sort of rambling nonsense has become. You cant genuinely believe this, can you? 
t1_dtx04ql	0	*	Detroit is GM.

t1_dtwldmt	0	*	Trump *is* the joke, one that has gone way too far.

t1_dtwy0s4	0	*	Oooooh laaaaa
t1_dtwz60a	0	*	Leverage how? Our interests in the region seem inherently conflicting.
t1_dtx670k	1	*	I'll never forget Bush Jnr's 'reelection' unfolding and wondering how such a massive country could be letting it all go unimpeded. What a trainwreck
t1_dtxqci0	0	*	The election has been compromised. It's not being challenged and we are left with a President people didn't vote for. Doesn't sound democratic at all.
t1_dtwxx27	1	*	Yeah, Minneapolis cops are a pretty low point for MN as well.
t1_dtwzy2m	1	*	And he's probably running again. Lol
t1_dtxidew	1	*	The Twin Cities and the rural (majority) areas of the state are pretty stark contrasts of each other. 
t1_dtx0wpw	1	*	Lol yeah i admit it is kind of obnoxious considering you can drive an hour from the cities to Wisconsin and buy a 30 rack of actual beer at the gas station for like $15 
t1_dtwy8vr	0	*	What? Am I having a stroke? I legitimately can't comprehend what you are saying.  Something about me making weird assumptions about what someone meant to say, do you boo boo- is that a common phrase?
t1_du3s72r	1	*	Since when were liberal views considered alt-right?  Get your head out of your own declared self righteous ass mate, seriously.

t1_dtxjsq3	1	*	Omnipotent? Nice hyperbole
t1_dtx39h0	1	*	After I seen an NBA post hit number 6 on the front page with <400 upvotes several hours ago I think you're right.  Shows u/marlet1 is a little misinformed though. 
t1_dtwy5qn	1	*	They wouldn't.  That was an attempt to derail the discussion.  Downvote and move on; controversy only leads to these ideas being promoted higher.
t1_dtxeuza	0	*	You sure? After I registered in Arizona, all I needed to bring to the poll was the registration card I was given. 
t1_dtwzvrt	0	*	That last part is hugely important. Pretty much *every* disease that's more detectable than it used to bewhich is to say, pretty much every diseaseis subject to that problem.

t1_dtwwm5v	0	*	I don't get it.  I really don't.  
t1_dtxf6qf	0	*	No, in your country, your government ID card is your enrollment. The US doesn't have those, they smell too much like tyranny.

t1_dtxgnzn	0	*	Absolute nonsense.
t1_dtx37i4	1	*	I know right. I think Trump thought the public is So stupid that they would take it at face value. To be honest, many did.
t1_dtwyk5o	1	*	I tried to take a picture of it but all I got was a tree fjordy.
t1_dtxyxnc	0	*	oh no, pop-pop, you've wandered out into the street again!
t1_dtxg9pc	0	*	Wow I fucked up. I meant Anoka but I edited that part out entirely because I dont think its entirely helpful. 
t1_dtx64lq	1	*	This is excellent. The layers are impressive!
t1_du0bjbl	1	*	Won the popular election, won this argument.  I think of all the terrible things Trump is doing, teaching losers that losing is wining is the most obnoxious.

t1_dtx98u9	1	*	The homeless exodus in California

t1_dtwwshd	1	*	Solid.
t1_dtwy88e	1	*	Heard of evidence? Read the articles and look for it. There is zero.
t1_dtx702v	1	*	He is pissed because he doesn't like his president and it's because his leaders were fucking incompetent.. But like all US failures they need a scapegoat..   
t1_dtx6w2s	1	*	Mississippi would like to just squeeeeze right past ya onto the list
t1_dtwxr0h	1	*	In the cities I mean.

t1_dtx3kv3	0	*	Oh trust me, I don't mind paying higher taxes if it means better schools, roads, and quality of life.  
t1_dtwz28v	0	*	He got my meaning. I made a mistake in writing. Odd how he picked it up and you couldnt.
t1_dtd6ib2	0	*	If we were close to being invaded we would have shot nukes anyway
t1_dtczcji	0	*	Also Florida has alligators and Australia has the rest.
t1_dtdkezs	0	*	Then again Australia declared war on them, so I'm thinking the emus might think along the lines of the enemy of of my enemy is my friend and support  the Canadian invasion with covert operations. 
t1_du0tqeh	0	*	You literally just said that is the case. That's your own words. 
t1_dupfwv0	0	*	It's still wrong imo. he said you can get one anytime when you arent criminal. That's not exactly true because you need a good reason to get a weaponownershipcard. 
t1_ducgt4o	0	*	So simple! Why doesn't Twitter say that.  Because then it'd be picked apart as bullshit.  You can spoof all of that information and they deleted the public evidence! 
t1_dud59lz	1	*	Pretty much explains what I observed when /r/TheDipshits was first formed...  Thry seemed like humans AND bots at the same time almost.  Impressive work, Russians!
t1_dud16n0	1	*	smithing lvls?
t1_dud3ea7	0	*	You're very transparent   Apparently the 13 that were indicted were your A squad  
t1_ducq9vc	0	*	Well, you for starters.
t1_ducpwbb	0	*	Come on man, are you really questioning this?
t1_dud05nw	0	*	Many of the same Trump supporters believed, minus the most obvious ones like Pizzagate and Uranium One. 
t1_ducsftw	0	*	Because normal people are not evil and malicious?
t1_dud2ime	0	*	Gosh I sure would love it if the GOP would stop trying to interfere with and stymie the investigation then....
t1_ducrlg6	1	*	Exactly! It's so frustrating that I understand why so many people just ignore the news and keep their biases. It's exhausting.
t1_dud10xi	0	*	The bill gave Trump the authority to implement more sanctions if necessary. It wasn't a mandate to do so immediately.
t1_ducu5t6	0	*	... which works because we're not wired for skepticism?
t1_ducvbee	0	*	The left is saying Russians are trying to create chaos, and that includes attacking both sides to create a civil war, but the Republicans are allowing it. 
t1_ducv1tq	0	*	Guess I wouldnt know since Democrats have never had to rely on it. 
t1_ducrub6	1	*	No it absolutely doesn't require discourse. And please, please try harder. 
t1_dud359p	0	*	Besides the discussion was about a Sanders vote vs a Clinton vote in the Primaries. Trump doesn't even factor into the topic.
t1_dud2j3c	1	*	Yes, and I lend my legitimacy to the same question because I believed in the validity of the question regardless of who asked it. 
t1_dud4n2t	1	*	I've read de Tocqueville, man. That's not what OP actually *said,* is the thing, which was a straightforward ad populum and was beside the point regardless
t1_ducwjs7	1	*	That hole will not stand... we'll make it a park!
t1_ducypun	1	*	Of course, and Rosenstein didn't disappoint with this update. This refutes any notion that the investigation is a witch hunt or that its purpose is unfounded/unwarranted.
t1_ducppsn	1	*	Supposedly, yes. 
t1_dudium5	0	*	If I wasn't convinced by your previous lack of any study or literally any evidence of any kind supporting that conclusion, I'm *definitely* convinced by it, now.
t1_ducncyi	1	*	Removing the problem solves the problem, true. But you just said to remove the problem, not *how* to remove the problem, so it's not a solution. It's more akin to a wish. 
t1_ducticy	0	*	Let me rephrase it: there is no evidence that they do.
t1_ducrckb	1	*	You are in the middle of a disinformation campaign   It's red alrert in St Petersburg 
t1_duct7s3	0	*	maybe read the headlines, its been the same before he was in place
t1_dudiwdk	0	*	Rigged is a strong word.   No amount of fair play could be given Bernie the win... 
t1_ducyvue	0	*	Most Americans don't know proper grammar. You're even more likely to be an agent. 
t1_ducgkay	0	*	Thank you. 
t1_dud1n12	0	*	m'kay.
t1_ducq694	0	*	No offense but calling out every divisive commenter as a Russian shill fuck without any evidence is gonna make it seem like a baseless conspiracy theory
t1_ducu6oj	0	*	And if Trump is found guilty of high treason? 
t1_ducpmlx	1	*	Oh, I have absolutely no idea how to enforce/legislate this.  It just seemed like the guy I was responding to was saying that it was crazy to want news online to be accurate.
t1_ducqjzw	1	*	These guys like u/overzealous_dentist are clueless. They just use buzzwords and think what they say is factual. It's how reddit works. 
t1_ducvaxb	0	*	the default, so hot
t1_dudisg7	0	*	God, that's fucking retarded.
t1_ducrr1l	0	*	Are you denying the 13 workers being indicte  You know it was released right?
t1_ducq39v	0	*	That is not logical.   I want the facts no matter what.
t1_dudu9dw	0	*	Translation: I can't refute, so just resort to personal attacks.  Don't worry, everything is gonna be ok.
t1_ducrtl2	0	*	This women works for Sinclair?

t1_dudp05g	1	*	> What do you propose we do?  Start by indicting the criminals involved. Like we did today.
t1_dudaiyz	1	*	Absolutely agree

t1_dud4y7h	1	*	The whole fake no go zones
t1_ducxft7	1	*	I'm always wary of:  I am a die-hard $POLITICALPERSUASION but you have to admit that the $OPPOSITEPOLITICALPERSUASION is right about this one.  
t1_ducs4kz	1	*	For sure thought you were talking about the snowbirds going to AZ and FL. LOL
t1_duckqjs	0	*	Troll. No time for someone who engages in whataboutism and false equivalencies. Only Fox lies with impunity and calls itself news on TV but entertainment in court. 
t1_dud2frm	1	*	You're right I could probably look through your post history and find something dumber.
t1_ductfql	0	*	Agree to the first 4.  Drudge....?
t1_dudxnmt	1	*	Hasn't it been actively investigating it for years upon years without finding anything at all?
t1_ducsaxz	0	*	Are you still ignoring the sanctions that Congress passed a law and Trump signed, but still refusing to act upon? Something will happen.
t1_ducufvb	1	*	yes its not about posting about the president its the type of conversation of both sides or lack thereof
t1_dud0uzb	0	*	Literally a thread about Russian criminals   Why can't we talk about the victims in this article instead!!
t1_ducsuj2	0	*	I just dont think theyre gonna get to Trump, as much as I dont like him, I dont think hes gonna end up eating shit at the end of all this.
t1_ducr3wh	0	*	or its a one sided echo chamber as the previous commenter evidently pointed out and you are in denial. 
t1_dudkm01	1	*	Oh snap
t1_ducosz6	0	*	The difference is between politics and espionage. You really see those as equivalent? 
t1_ducxc7b	0	*	> So even though most made informed decisions it only took a few that didn't to have an effect.  That's the nature of democracy. Its not perfect, but its what we've got.
t1_ducsqx0	1	*	I feel so embarrassed for him
t1_ducrpzo	0	*	If there was ever one reason to attack Canada...
t1_ducqnw1	1	*	Media outlets have teams devoted to scouring social media, I'm certain this came from one of them.
t1_ducvcuv	0	*	You have get paid at least a grand?

t1_ducu9fv	0	*	You're not wrong at all.  I was just so surprised to see it!
t1_ducpcy4	0	*	One key difference is that it is legal for FB to sell political ads targeted at the US to the American political organization. It is not legal for them to sell them to foreign ones.
t1_ducs87v	0	*	What removal of freedoms did you infer from my comment?
t1_ducxl75	1	*	> Trump fans really  I can't imagine why they wouldn't like a Partisan attempting to tell them how awful their shit smells while they stand knee deep in their own.
t1_ducsi1n	0	*	No its an alliance. They have interest in stopping disinformation
t1_duct3pb	0	*	Again incredibly transparent I guess those 13 they got indicted for the a squad because holy shit you guys aren't sending your best and brightest anymore
t1_dud07zj	1	*	That is a complete misunderstanding of the situation and evolution.  I'm not sure what you think Darwinism is exactly.
t1_ductt0r	0	*	Go back to sleep. The unicorns are calling.
t1_ducs3g1	1	*	Welcome to the overarching plan, create this fake hysteria, and take power as a way to prevent them
t1_ducr2nf	0	*	A particular group of jews =/= Jewish people at large.
t1_ducrlur	0	*	They still have a lower viscosity than most birds. Might explain why a roasted goose was always such a great.
t1_ducvy0t	1	*	It's utterly ridiculous to be honest. People have this mentality that the center is where you should be, even though the American center is massively different from that in Europe. 
t1_ducsfpo	1	*	Don't mistake slower action for no action at all. The last thing we want is a serious charge sliding off of him because everyone was so eager to see the fucker in court.
t1_ducqvol	0	*	I mean, they aren't wrong.  The United States absolutly tries to influence other governments.
t1_ducsyri	0	*	That law was passed to give him the power IF NEEDED.
t1_ducriac	1	*	We should build a wall and make the geese pay for it!

t1_ducso65	0	*	It's the firehose of disinformation that Putin mastered  Just spam absolute nonsense all the time, so many lies that you can't keep track 
t1_dud21if	0	*	Bernie voters repeated all kinds of bullshit about Clinton. We need to come to terms with that. I was a Bernie voter, but Bernie's fans both online and IRL were not always an admirable group. 
t1_dud0azh	0	*	5W50 synthetic? JTF2 has black book poutine recipe that you have somehow acquired! Wet team coming for you now,go off grid now! Wait.. Did you mean vicious? Nevermind.
t1_ducscpw	1	*	Watergate took a year and a half.  They have to be 100% sure before moving because people at that level of power can easily erase evidence if they know where to look.
t1_dudav8v	1	*	I wasn't trying to argue Hillary's health condition, i was only confirming it was a thing during the election.   
t1_dud1guc	1	*	Sometimes I like waiting for something big.  Some 16 indictments and a guilty plea? This is quite a status update.
t1_ducsf9e	0	*	Why would that matter? New technology will only speed things up a bit, and the implications of this are far greater than watergate. I would be surprised if it took much less time.
t1_ds5cn4h	1	*	The Security council? Also, a straw man argument is when you exaggerate the other person's point to make it look foolish and then argue against that.  Nice try though.
t1_dt1cs2b	1	*	My friend said he wants one of the patrol boats to turn into his personal yacht, haha.
t1_dt0i7rv	0	*	Yet they replayed the same prank on Lybia and Syria, 2 of the most stable countries in their respective regions.  So no, it's just the US protecting their oil/weapon interests.
t1_dt0j6l1	0	*	So uh.... which side do we want to win? Because I think both sides are chanting that.
t1_dt0iluo	0	*	why is it so important that Iran backs the houthis? Iran is better than saudi arabia
t1_dt0ifev	0	*	https://www.oecd.org/els/health-systems/Obesity-Update-2017.pdf
t1_dt0iijl	0	*	So what's the original conflict? Why was it started and why is NATO doing nothing? Or are both sides just as guilty? Any solid, non-biased answers are appreciated. 
t1_dt0n4ru	1	*	As long as it isn't run by one of those stable geniuses...
t1_dt0t1vm	0	*	The Saudis and Israelis straight piss in Americas coffee and America drinks it with a forced smile 
t1_dt1j2yj	1	*	Man I'm from Kentucky, I'm used to getting bashed everywhere too, lol.
t1_dt0lmnh	0	*	Where did you read this? The latest figures I could find were from 2013, when USA was 20% and Europe 11%. And figures from 2016 which show Saudi as USAs second largest foreign supplier of oil.
t1_dt0kajn	0	*	But if Europe stopped buying from Saudi - they would instead, have to buy from the same places the US buys from - so the price would go up - quite a lot!
t1_dt0m3el	1	*	Because the US has most of the oil they need right here in the States
t1_dt0k0va	1	*	The terrorist will go on to kill more civilians, happens every time. If people didn't fight because of civilian casualties, the world will be an even worse place.
t1_dt0j0wz	0	*	But Saudi Arabia has the most, thus dictating the market price. They control OPEC.
t1_dt0gckc	0	*	It's one guy with 30 guns

t1_dt0j4lw	1	*	Come on, youre not really that naive.
t1_dt0j9tl	0	*	Hmmm. They obviously had a reason for attacking US ships. Whether they were justified or not is another question...
t1_dt0r28w	0	*	Had your country's education sector not been slashed by your gov's neoliberal reforms, you would have learned history in school. And not to misquote people.
t1_dt0qxhs	0	*	That makes way more sense. I'm not sure where the idea that the middle east controls our oil comes from when the U.S actually produces about 40% of its own oil.
t1_dt0imu6	0	*	well good thing saudis arent fighting iran and instead fight the houthis
t1_dt0j619	1	*	Kinda what I figured, thanks.
t1_dt0j5qt	0	*	Forgot reddit has no humor.

t1_dt0jbnk	1	*	Shit I forgot about that arms deal. What a bunch of bullshit.
t1_dt0nzke	0	*	I do think its because these countries asked for work people because they didn't have enough.
t1_dt0gkp7	0	*	It has to be made before 1986. 
t1_dt0lk1k	0	*	uh, pretty sure all the world's problems are the fault of the US dude
t1_dt0rdut	1	*	I don't think European militaries generate enough demand from foreign manufacturers
t1_dt0odq9	1	*	Or you know, multiple master's degrees in business
t1_dt0qch9	1	*	Right, but even in Congress it's not like the issue is being unilaterally decided. There are some quite prominent members strongly opposed to continuing sanction of these arms deals.
t1_dt1aqqo	1	*	Probably.
t1_dt0mtro	1	*	If they ain't wahhabis....
t1_dt0iws1	1	*	If we're nice to SA, they'll keep trading oil in USD. If we're not, they might switch to another currency. That would be bad for (wealthy and powerful) Americans so we keep supporting them.
t1_dt0klst	1	*	Doesn't mean we have to openly support them
t1_dt0j24s	0	*	Oh sweet summer child
t1_dt0oerk	1	*	Or you know, multiple master's degrees in business

t1_dt0odk5	1	*	Or you know, multiple master's degrees in business
t1_dt0ikjr	1	*	Actually its that the US and Saudis dont want an Iranian proxy running Yemen like Gaza and Lebanon. 
t1_dt0n8s4	0	*	Drone strikes in Yemen have been going on for years. As well as arms sales. 
t1_dt1mvwy	0	*	Your name is harassment_victim, yet you are pelting me with this bullshit.  Go find me pictures of emaciated Saudi children, I'll wait.
t1_dsrloq0	0	*	You use violence for a political gain, while not sanctioned as a military or government force. So it's terrorism. 
t1_duasnhc	0	*	well fuck, buddy. cant just be making another eh joke. it might become some stereotype or something

t1_duqa4gq	1	*	Thanks. Good luck on getting published !
t1_dsbbtxa	0	*	No it isn't. If a gas plant replaces a coal plant that's a reduction. If a gas plant is stopped this keeping a coal plant open that's more popitoon than allowing the gas plant.

t1_dtits1w	0	*	You want a round with a slower muzzle velocity.  It will closer follow the trajectory of the rocket.
t1_dtjd36t	1	*	Well the one step that was missed is 'responsible gun ownership.' Really an all encompassesing argument.

t1_dtira85	0	*	Thank you for your cervix hooah devil doge  Plenty of people serve.
t1_dtk7fo9	0	*	you should ALWAYS check to see if the gun is unloaded and to do that you need to tack the slide and need to release the striker before disassembling.
t1_duy667z	0	*	I was a devout Trotskyist for many years. I know how Marxists and modern academic leftists think.  The left is celebrating this move.

t1_durrg81	0	*	Military grade equipment you just wrote yourself out of the conversation 
t1_dus0mzs	1	*	We have a reasonable amount of gun control but what we're currently missing is a reasonable amount of enforcement of gun comtrol.

t1_dur4xqf	0	*	Do you know me? I dont believe guns should be taken away. I do believe that people with a history of violence shouldnt be able to legally get their hands on guns. 
t1_dus2tw2	1	*	It's not. He has no equity and no portion of equality in our American social contract. It's immoral to influence our property rights.

t1_dscqefv	0	*	There is an easy solution for someone who sees something in public they don't want to.  Just look away.
t1_dsc3lxb	1	*	Had a buddy get thrown out. They now say no cameras or cellphones even out. 
t1_dsbvhrc	1	*	Ive breastfed at a concert. We brought our 5 month old with us as she wont take a bottle and had no other choice. We did have protective ear muffs for her and she slept most of the time. 
t1_dt08nax	1	*	He didn't do any of those things.  You on the other hand do exactly that.
t1_duqs0q9	0	*	You can't take me serious when I criticize the NRA for arming our dogs.  That's not how this works.

t1_dsvnf2o	0	*	TIL the NRA only thinks 2A rights apply to the squeaky clean. 
t1_dsvx5qo	0	*	I mean you should also just not buy Springfield simply due to the fact that their products are trash
t1_dsvxdhn	1	*	*You* doing so? I've only read your right wing talking point filled post so snap judgement time: yes.
t1_dsvp9mj	0	*	I don't like to see the gun laws boil down to Right or Left, there should be reasonable laws established to keep gun owners and the public safe.
t1_dsx8n48	0	*	Okay, then let's put the same restrictions on voting. Call it even.
t1_dsvi0eg	1	*	Your allowed to disagree. People have been foretelling of the downfall of America for decades... it will fall as will everything eventually. Only question is when
t1_dsvato9	0	*	Then what the fuck is the point of gun control? What the fuck is the point of the war on drugs? 
t1_dswjioe	0	*	So... What's the problem?   You can just continue not hurting people. 
t1_dsy07hh	0	*	Do a simple Google search for racist Trump quotes. There's no shortage. Not sure if you're just trolling or genuinely believe he's not racist.. 
t1_dsvaqpy	0	*	Yup. It's about culture.
t1_dsvxddf	1	*	It depends on why you're doing it.
t1_dt0oz2a	0	*	We're still doing that. We're bombing more than ever. Even in your false dichotomy you have no idea what the hell you're on about. 
t1_dsxvai4	1	*	And Republicans don't?  
t1_dsxmo7t	0	*	If its perfectly acceptable than nothing will come of it
t1_dswrvt7	1	*	No, try Ublock Origin, it's better :D
t1_dsvx9e0	1	*	It is possible to come to terms with the relative risks of things you are fearful of.
t1_dsy85rn	1	*	I dont post links to the NRA
t1_dsw4cw3	0	*	Wait, I'm confused what you were arguing now. Were you arguing in favor of what the NRA said, or agreeing with me? I may have misinterpreted your original reply
t1_dsvy90m	0	*	> most fascistic states tend to be either Socialist or Communist  Are you actually being serious? Hitler? Moussolini? Franco?
t1_dsvycgv	1	*	If you're doing it so that your children aren't around those of another race, sure. If not, probably not. Again though, because people said some things on the internet then real concerns are invalid? 
t1_dsvehsp	0	*	I thought they were a pretty strong military power overall, but lacked force projection. Could they not clean up against Eastern Europe pretty easily since its just a direct land route. 
t1_dswz4l7	1	*	Ad block Plus is garbage. Follow the other users advice and use UBlock Origin. 
t1_du8ocsq	0	*	absolutely not.  i'd take the early warning as a blessing and start packing up. 
t1_du9m7wm	1	*	Right, I forgot about that. The US instituted a 1 month conscription program and that's what caused Vietnam. France is totally on the same path now.
t1_du8gb1f	1	*	Dishonourable discharge it is then because fuck that noise. I'd just refuse to run, they can't physically force you to do anything other than yell at you which is hardly incentive.
t1_du8aqqw	1	*	That underplays just how much the rest of the Armxe9e de Terre do overseas. The L.E. are great, but they're a small fraction of the regular army's troops currently in Africa right now.
t1_du8a3tn	1	*	Wut.
t1_du82dyh	1	*	The clue is in the name

t1_dt1kqyt	0	*	Yeah those cars cost a lot. And virtually no where sells it. Hydrogen is a red herring designed to throw people off electric cars
t1_dt2y0zz	0	*	Wtf?  You want to burn carbon fuels just for the nostalgia?  Would you like a side of lead paint chips with that?
t1_dt1z5tl	1	*	My last game in CiV took me 50 hours, but that's only because I play on huge maps on a slow computer with tonnes of mods. Most games last 5-10 hours.

t1_dt1kecn	0	*	Got links? 
t1_dt1ok28	0	*	And the best insulated tank on the market, BMW's if memory serves, would keep a snowball frozen for quite literally years; yet over the course of weeks, over half of the hydrogen would escape.

t1_dsm5ikh	0	*	The last decade is 2000-2010, during which the IRA set of 3 car bombs and fired an RPG at MI-6 HQ  It also includes the Islamic bombing in London, so the timeframe isn't perfect.
t1_dsmag6u	1	*	Stolen Valor! Get him!
t1_dsx51gf	0	*	Nobody's suggesting we do anything. All we are saying is he is not a good guy. Are we wrong?
t1_dswguky	0	*	It matters.  Soros cannot be allowed to continue his corruption of governments that don't follow his leftist agenda... obviously.

t1_dubg45o	1	*	Well to be fair, the Syrians were major dicks for the first few hundreds of years. they like.. stole peoples ice cream (and maybe enslaved whole peoples)
t1_duco2o6	0	*	The Russians together with the SAA mainly defeated ISIS. And no, the SDF are hardly moderates.
t1_duarnnc	1	*	Im positive that youve not only dont understand the US Republic, but youve never read anything that the Founding Fathers wrote. You really need to do your civics homework. 
t1_duddwqa	1	*	Civilization isn't the same as it always was. And i am by no means a pacifist. I, however, do not believe anyone should be gladened by violence because it's payback. 
t1_duafas0	1	*	Oh, yes, I'll agree with you on that.
t1_dubba3g	0	*	The UK did the exact same thing in the 70s and 80s but you didn't see the CIA suddenly start funding the IRA to overthrow the British government.

t1_dtcjzue	0	*	So have that discussion, instead of trying to ban it.
t1_dtcqh0b	0	*	The idea of a government in exile in a different country is strange to me. Can you really be in charge of a country remotely?

t1_dsjpjte	1	*	But if we let in the Norwegians, we'd still technically be taking care of people from a different country. It's just that these ones would be white.

t1_dsjv72d	0	*	If he does all his supporters are going to come and blame the Left for calling him racist. Saying things like we used that word too much and now it doesn't mean anything or some shit.
t1_dsk3jke	0	*	Russia and Ukraine are in Europe? :D
t1_dskjovf	1	*	Don't even bother, he's immune to logical thinking, just likes the feeling of superiority from his president insulting entire races of people.

t1_dsk3kcz	0	*	Like?
t1_dsjw7fd	1	*	It only really works out if you cut the spigot off at some point and let the system catch up.  Thats basically what the US did when they started imposing limits.

t1_dsk0zxv	0	*	>Africans never even invented the wheel...  The Egyptians had chariots in the 16th century BCE. Try again, racist.
t1_dsjriy3	0	*	Yeah, I disagree. I've lived in one of these African countries, only an ignoramus would generalize any of them as shitholes.
t1_dsk3ab0	0	*	too bad 90% of these middle/lower class Americans will never ever ever become rich no matter what they do. 
t1_dsjx9it	0	*	How would you define a fair share of someone else's money?
t1_dsjthu6	0	*	Why is it fair to compare gross to gross? Taxes are a huge variable. Net to net is the accurate comparison.

t1_dsk4s7o	1	*	I didn't say anything about anything you just said. I have no idea why you even bothered to say it.   If you want ppl to go to college then the government should make state schools free. 
t1_dsjyfdd	0	*	These arguments conveniently ignore Canada which has better social mobility and has health care, it's not homogenous. It also ignores the fact that most European countries are not homogenous.

t1_dsjugzk	1	*	A GERMAN drinking Budweiser? Does not compute...
t1_dsk0ren	1	*	Very well said. Reddit scares me with how far off the deep end both sides go. This is what happens when politics is treated like a bloodsport instead of what it really is... legislation and governing.
t1_dsjv3kh	1	*	Actually he served 8 years lmao. 
t1_dsjvt0j	0	*	Correct. Obama was also very very tight lipped about and with journalists.   It was a good strategy by him I dont blame him.

t1_dsl4ef6	1	*	Nah didn't notice it, sorry. A lot of alt right in this thread, so pretty easy to make the mistake.
t1_dsjznj5	1	*	Yeah, but that's not my point.  You can't use the top 1% of a population as an example to say that the country is not a very difficult place to live.

t1_dsjzm0q	0	*	Yeah, but I wouldn't look at the top 1% of people in a country and use that as a baseline of what the country is like...
t1_dsk6w6f	0	*	I'm not going to overlook the problems that a country has and feel obligated to import their poverty just because they are only 0.5% white.
t1_dsjun55	0	*	I have no doubt that their data is correct, but it's only for a selection of 35 countries. I fail to see how they are proving the claim, nowhere does it state that these are the 35 highest.

t1_dsju88i	1	*	Damn, thats old!

t1_dsjy8d6	0	*	I'm sure the leaders of those respective countries should be the last to say it, but again, I agree with your point that it was disrespectful and inapropriate. 
t1_dsl0pn2	1	*	According to this index, those countries are objectively shitholes relatively. Im still unsure of the purpose of bringing up the index if not trying to make that point.
t1_dskloze	0	*	What? No. I looked u the number of actual muslims on both countries, which is 2,9% in Norway and 0,9% in the US. Don't reflect your racism on me.

t1_dsjvldd	0	*	We should reduce the sentences of mass murderers? 
t1_dsk8l2b	0	*	That's fine, but it's a bad system to have H1Bs distributed by lottery. It shouldn't be capped, and if the numbers are a problem the salary or requirements should be raised.

t1_dsk0pi8	1	*	It's relevant because countries with mostly black people (Africa and South America, and yes before you start, I know those are continents) *are* indeed shitholes, like the president said. 
t1_dsk8qlb	1	*	No. We spend almost none of that. Only a percentage of the profits of investment is used. Most government money comes from taxes
t1_dska6kb	1	*	That would be where you point to France or the UK which aren't homogenous, but have functioning welfare and universal healthcare.

t1_dsr9n6x	0	*	no im not, can you elaborate the racism? can you point to anything he said about race? are you just making shit up?  Why would trump say something different if the country was white? races are equal

t1_dsk1cu8	1	*	Yeah, the American people did choose those candidates. By not voting the majority of our country let it happen. If they didn't want it to happen they would vote. 
t1_dsjp047	0	*	Not sure why you think a post was an attempt to demonstrate rationality. My previous post was a statement, not an attempt.

t1_ds60cec	0	*	Tell me where you're from and post your finding Europlebe.
t1_ds6350v	1	*	What? Are you ok with the media inventing fake news storys? I'm not sure what you are going for here
t1_ds5vt3o	0	*	They can apparently also just shoot them.  ^(I know they can't, by law, but they seem to do so in a worrying number of cases and escape with very little scrutiny any way).
t1_ds5t80y	0	*	Get off Reddit man. This is the dumbest shit I've read in a month.
t1_ds66mli	0	*	Even when those state secrets are both unethical and illegal?
t1_ds6bwcy	1	*	Common Sense is an equivalent to a modern blog. So no.
t1_ds6i29c	1	*	Well, at least you have found the reasoning for building strawmen.
t1_ds65abd	0	*	> Figuring out the bias of a news source shouldn't be difficult if there's an obvious pattern it follows.  Except people actually like biased sources.
t1_ds5y5wa	0	*	Is it? Were there rules or laws forbidding the FCC from using their regulatory power over the internet?
t1_ds5wrsp	0	*	GreatPopery, Your metaphysical claims are false. 
t1_ds5vlds	0	*	You dont understand anything about law lmao. Appear to have been intentionally misleading... APPEAR to have been? What the fuck? That's not basis for law. 
t1_ds677x6	0	*	Your freedom of speech is absolute unless it isn't.
t1_ds5vvi1	0	*	So we're just gonna trust them to be 100% right huh? Shit sounds exactly like 1984. The Ministry of truth
t1_ds6aec3	1	*	Natxfcrlich Herr Braunhemd.
t1_ds6fw5r	0	*	Corporations have no control over free speech. Net Neutrality restricted ISPs freedom. 
t1_ds7cwb7	0	*	What point are you trying to make? I'm genuinely not following.
t1_ds61qrp	1	*	Only if they are political corespondents. 
t1_ds68xnn	0	*	Where did i say that? I used the dolan drump method, its just some people that are telling me this
t1_ds68ujj	0	*	Doesn't everyone on the Internet consider themselves brighter than an average American - including or especially the Americans?
t1_ds69q1n	0	*	Won't someone please just think of the corporations?
t1_ds60q63	0	*	But H3H3 and Defranco admit their biases, but they still try and tell the whole story before weighing in on the issue.
t1_ds5upt3	0	*	Can you dispute what I said? Because it is 100% fact. It's a good idea to inform yourself on topics outside of how Reddit tells you to think. 
t1_ds6c31n	0	*	Except there's a broader conversation going on in this thread, and within that broader context, it's very clear what you're trying to argue for.
t1_ds5k8pa	0	*	Exactly, perfectly sensible law, in light of recent events.   Also, freedomhouse has other methodologies and still northern european countries and germany come out on top 
t1_ds5zzgu	0	*	> Radio content is necessarily regulated because there is only one spectrum.  Replace Radio with Internet ... there's only one of those also.
t1_ds6fq1j	0	*	Not especially, only there. There are other factors to freedom than denying the holocaust, you know?
t1_ds646pw	1	*	Being a waiter and making cash tips.
t1_ds60wsl	0	*	Deal. But I can't promise you that I'll remember a promise I made at 1:15 AM, haha.
t1_ds614n7	0	*	So it's not impossible, then.
t1_ds5kaft	0	*	Lmao I'm not taking a side. I just find it funny that he opened it, and didn't even check the tab that said methodology.   
t1_ds68bsc	1	*	Or random capitalisation? What is this amateur hour?
t1_ds69r05	1	*	And he is implying that no other countries, in this case france, have that, dont pretend you dont know.
t1_ds5xcxc	1	*	So not allowing foreign countries to pay domestic news broadcasters to say things? 
t1_ds6818s	0	*	Oxford. Look it up and let me know the difference.
t1_ds5taei	0	*	I think he means that the first amendment is great and all, but doesn't accomplish much without the second. It's a valid point.
t1_ds6ftpj	1	*	Oh shit, yeah, always forget about that ridiculous incarceration rate, thanks.   Much free, very dom
t1_ds6r4is	0	*	Does history not include Carter?   Obviously the president can take some steps towards peace, and they can take a *lot* of steps away from peace. Trump has done the latter.
t1_dt0ax5s	1	*	Well while you're at it I'll buy. But all I've got is reddit silver
t1_dt0b3vf	1	*	something about WrestleMania 29

t1_duk2bwb	0	*	I recall new Orleans being them when their refugees came to us. 
t1_dulu462	1	*	a complete lack of flexibility on all fronts. sounds horrible. 
t1_duk8grv	1	*	He does not agree with your opinion, so you are a Russian agent.  
t1_duk8jj1	0	*	I think he's insinuating that you're a russian troll
t1_due4afn	0	*	It's not the question that was offensive. It was the general intonation. Shame you people haven't the brains to work things out for yourselves.  
t1_duezwpe	1	*	I am Catholic m8
t1_due4dgm	0	*	Why don't you get lost.Just because you ask a question doesn't mean that you are going to get the answer you want.  
t1_dv2du7p	0	*	Idk 51 doesn't sound as cool as an even 50 states
t1_dv2bkeq	1	*	And every single person born in PR are born an American citizen.
t1_dv3bat0	1	*	What I meant is that future Puerto Ricans not born yet would not be citizens by birth
t1_dseqlfl	1	*	That's a bit different to you can't enter any of them
t1_dsfkwj6	1	*	All of them are generally good-natured and well-liked except for one?
t1_dsd0dwn	0	*	Apparently, the trick is to get them near a cliff edge, so they push back.
t1_dty8gyp	0	*	Really, most people? Are you certain of that? 
t1_dtxz65k	0	*	You must have looked shocked when your watch hands started spinning an hour back or forward driving through there.
t1_dty6dvt	0	*	Yes, but it's stored in UTC format. Everyone will read Banks open 9am in your frontend, but the value that would be stored and interpreted by the program would be something different.
t1_dtxskzj	1	*	Florida doesn't have skeeters? Hahahahaha! Liar.
t1_dtxvr8l	0	*	I'm pretty sure you should have been confused more often in those trips.
t1_dtyavte	1	*	Light during my commute home. I feel like I have more time left after work when its still light outside. In the morning it makes a small difference to me personally. 
t1_dtxwmhl	0	*	Might I suggest UTC?
t1_dtxzds9	0	*	mom's spaghetti at my door
t1_dty02ns	1	*	The source makes it a lot better. Without the source it seemed like you were just being sarcastic.
t1_dtxxaqm	0	*	Me too and I came out 10 years younger
t1_dtypctn	0	*	We do,  but if its that big a deal to have more sunlight in the evening, adjust work hours instead of the entire structure of time. 
t1_dtyahp4	1	*	Then that's what the script should address.
t1_dty8he3	1	*	Because I thought daylight savings gave you an extra hour of sunlight in the evenings in winter but it's the summer.
t1_dtxwgrc	0	*	Apparently it's just inception
t1_dtxzb7f	0	*	Pretty sure you are the one whooshing.
t1_dtyfx9x	1	*	I have, but only when writing small scripts or tightly-bound scraping software that wasnt useful outside a particular location, and even then I used named timezones not UTC offsets. 
t1_dtxz7a7	1	*	Are you trying to tell me that when people are warned about a potentially serious situation but take that warning seriously and fix the underlying issue, nothing bad happens?!?
t1_dty5777	1	*	I only sleep in the day because of GMT. 
t1_dtybp0w	1	*	Oh, I guess that's true.
t1_dty0j3o	0	*	Oh I see, getting the offset is useful *now*, but you can't predict what the offset will be in 6 months' time because you don't actually know the timezone.  Getting rid of DST would fix that, I guess.
t1_dtygc74	1	*	Its easier for one government to just decide the time then coordinating with each business to change the time. Most probably wouldnt even bother. 
t1_dty53i2	0	*	But sunrise at 8:30?
t1_dtxz84n	1	*	Yep it's about that time
t1_dty98he	0	*	Dumber than changing the measurement of time twice a year?
t1_dtym9m9	1	*	That's crazy talk!
t1_dtyeohw	1	*	They're already not centered, because time zones.
t1_dtxwoxr	0	*	DST is where it's at. Standard time sucks.   As someone from the northern latitudes, I fucking hate it when it's dark at 3:30 pm.
t1_dty0sht	0	*	No they set themselves by the atomic clock so there's no other way. 
t1_dty3mcj	1	*	I too have been on Facebook
t1_dty6f64	1	*	Because then it would be pitch black out until 9am or so.  Saving daylight refers to saving it until later in the day.
t1_dty24qn	0	*	Its designed so that noon is solar noon. I suppose that used to be more important. 
t1_dty5i4i	0	*	You are right. But I fear my productivity will drop when I'm at work and school in the morning. But yes more light at home is nice. 
t1_dtxzpcb	0	*	What's wrong with it?  People are waking up an hour earlier and calling the day an hour longer.
t1_dty8mb3	0	*	Your clock time is based on the position of the Sun...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7yoXhbOQ3Y
t1_dty2ojm	0	*	You're right 9000/13500 != 100%.   You're good at math, but bad at understanding samples, confidence levels and confidence intervals.
t1_dty84me	1	*	Yeah but you're still growing up in Indiana.
t1_dtxr9gm	0	*	Are those anything like swamp donkeys? 
t1_dty11tt	0	*	I'd never heard of him before this thread. But I have driven through the Navajo nation.
t1_dty3c0m	1	*	I live in Seattle... So... I don't know if that's far enough North but it never gets cold here.  
t1_dtxyski	1	*	Appreciate it! good source and a simple read thanks.
t1_dty19y1	0	*	fuck your utc, I use epoch
t1_dtxyrh5	1	*	I see no source.
t1_dtxxrmi	0	*	Nice. So self absorbed. U0001f44d   Edit: Humorless Brits!
t1_dty6g0l	0	*	Farmers had nothing to do with daylight savings time. Retail stores in cities lobbied for it.
t1_dtyi1ub	1	*	Or perhaps there were some minor lurking issues, but then 2001/2002 came, the dot com bubble ended and everyone had bigger issues  
t1_dty9lay	1	*	Always good to call your mother. 
t1_dty8gw6	1	*	Thankfully time is relative concept on the reservation. Everyone is pretty casual about things.
t1_dtxztqw	0	*	why not just say its due in X amount of hours....thatd be easier.
t1_dtxzmsi	0	*	 Source? I'm interested. 
t1_dtyfoz2	1	*	Another mystery solved. A nice conversation had. Today way a good day.
t1_dtyal7k	1	*	innitech..the company was called innitech
t1_dty03jz	0	*	I'm all for wise words from Native Americans, but the guy didn't have a clue about the issue if he said that sincerely.
t1_dtygwmf	0	*	Welcome to the real world where things change and you as a company have to be prepared for that, as that is literally why people give you money.
t1_dtya4q3	1	*	If you stay on daylight savings, then it would be 6:30, not 4:30. For daylight savings you move the clock forward one hour, making it stay light out longer. 
t1_dty1hkx	0	*	I really don't think most people have clocks that change automatically, on their phone and PC sure, but regular alarm clocks no chance. 
t1_dtyfq9z	1	*	Well not everyone works a 9-5. Besides easier to change clocks then business hours. 
t1_dty5mi2	1	*	No.  It was a cop-out because Finland was making noise.  ...but not there's going to be a giant fucking mess.
t1_dty9c10	1	*	Seeing as no one seems to remember themselves - yes. Because it's a nuisance with no emotional attachment. 
t1_dtyboeb	0	*	A lot of people work 8-4.
t1_dty1rqt	1	*	TIL I learned about astronomical twilight. Though the part of Germany I live in does get night except for a couple of days around June solstice. 
t1_dty7jhd	0	*	Not now, no. Last month it did. Now it's more like 16:45. I know that because I can finally watch the sun set on my way to work again instead of spending all my waking hours under a dark sky
t1_dtze28t	1	*	I don't know where mludd is from but I'm from the far south of Sweden. This Christmas I was working from 8:45 to 16:00 in a basement without windows. Never saw the sun. 
t1_dty8igy	1	*	Like [this piece](https://goo.gl/maps/37bSZusNHhu) of the UAE's Emirate of Sharjah that is in Oman's territory of Madha, that is in the UAE's Emirate of Fujairah.
t1_dty1o3n	0	*	You're right! Time zones do make it more burdensome to travel. I think that's a discussion for another time though.
t1_dty3xh0	0	*	Only if you get to work before 8am.   Not for people who get to work by 9, or kids who get to school by 8:30.
t1_dty49a8	0	*	This does not sound like a standard use case. I dont think we should change time so the sunrise is at 5am. Im sure its easier for those getting up, but thats way earlier than most (I hope). 
t1_dtya2x2	1	*	LET'S DO THE TIME WARP AGAAAAAIN!
t1_dtzb127	0	*	Approx 58 degrees north, this is what would happen with winter time all year round.
t1_dty2eea	1	*	Also worth noting that in the UK, daylight on the winter solstice is about 8am - 4pm. Normal working hours is 9-5. If we kept BST during the winter, daylight hours would be about 9-5.
t1_dty461u	0	*	Eventhough we spend more time in BST so it should really just be British Time and then have a winter timezone. 
t1_dty9isb	1	*	Did that trip late last year, the best part was having no cell signal for 2 hours.
t1_dty4qge	1	*	Except time doesnt change. Is it really that hard to change your alarm?
t1_dtygpvt	1	*	Even so, isn't reducing sunlight by 90% or more way better than still-bright-as-day ~25% reduction provided by conventional curtains?
t1_dtxzya2	1	*	Liechtenstein! Double landlocked!
t1_dtxzuzv	1	*	Are you sure you came out? You might be stuck in a time loop.
t1_dtyy26e	1	*	That's so crazy, it might just work!
t1_dty52cg	0	*	I think most people go to work in the morning, so more daylight in the morning is optimal.
t1_dty3wvu	1	*	>detrimental  You don't even notice it.
t1_dtzbskd	1	*	What's your idea of it? 
t1_dt2uddz	0	*	Exactly. Release the innocent people.
t1_dt272mx	1	*	I can complain about Mexico and the U.S killing people at the same time. 
t1_dt1km6w	0	*	So five of them are alive? Or did you mean to say all but one is dead?
t1_dt19xsm	0	*	Don't even trip, dog.
t1_dt1ssh1	1	*	Parts of it absolutely are!
t1_dt1qz3c	0	*	My upvotes clearly mean I am correct. If I am correct the you are not.
t1_dt1nm08	0	*	Well, yeah that'd be great. The criminals should pay for killing American citizens
t1_dt1qfjl	1	*	No? I was the one saying US tanks would be just fine in Mexico.
t1_dt14ama	0	*	Wtf, no. That's a totally different war. You're off by 50ish years, there.   
t1_dt2kj7t	1	*	I knew it was independent but I thought it was still... you know what? nvm, thx for the correction!
t1_dt1ihvq	0	*	Yes, but I'm highly doubtful they have hundreds of thousands or millions of members  Edit: Feel free to change my mind with reputable sources though

t1_dst68px	1	*	Heating an engine block prior to starting.
t1_dsuo5z6	1	*	Yes and my point is that the person wasn't being naxefve to say that climate and weather are separate things, even though the two are obviously connected
t1_dstx21e	0	*	Well if you're selling cars in a warm climate its kindof an unnecessary piece of equipment...
t1_dsuv9u3	0	*	Merely a joke. 
t1_dv5s8z2	1	*	Jesus. It's like a $100k Australia tax. I thought video game prices were bad! Enjoy your giant Ute's mate!
t1_dt0anyd	1	*	Don't even try, you're being completely reasonable yet you're downvoted. 
t1_dt07ldf	0	*	That it's reasonable to adjust the official uniform of a British police force to the garb of an unwelcome foreign religion
t1_dszjpfy	0	*	I was being facetious. Police often wear balaclavas, however.

t1_duegpgh	0	*	Yes, if you're russian, get the fuck out of other countries' politics.
t1_due9xet	0	*	You should have seen their support of the Russians running the TN GOP twitter. They loved them and supported them wholeheartedly.
t1_due5llu	0	*	Except I'm not from the United States but most Americans I know feel hostility towards Russia and despite not being at war they are about as far from friendly they can be.

t1_duecbj6	1	*	Yes, Ive been there. Its an old and inaccurate measurement. Huff post did a bit on it at some point.

t1_dueityk	1	*	Aren't you guys supposed to be the pull yourself up from your bootstraps type?  Why would you ever attribute your newly found success in life to someone else's doing? 
t1_duepil2	1	*	That is when you leave, go to the atm take out as much money as you can, call the local cops and  bribe yourself an army and save your wife.

t1_duezhyd	1	*	In Russia it's one man rob or beat another you have to watch your back everyone is trying to use you that's why it's cool in russia to be able to be rude and push people away to protect yourself 
t1_duei998	1	*	Yeah the *Muslim* god is complete nonsense! Worship the real, *Christian* god, because he's way more real!

t1_dueb39n	0	*	Why do it yourself when you have loyal employees?
t1_dugcgpc	0	*	He is supporting h1bs now and there is no racial component, so it doesn't matter if he is personally racist.  Indians will continue to exploit h1bs to get entry level jobs in the US.

t1_duere4i	1	*	> So you're saying the russians ~~stole~~ raped a british guys wife?  
t1_dugjsca	0	*	You didnt address anything I said. I thought we could actually have some discourse.     You had no factual or informed rebuttal, just let off a bunch of rhetoric. No evidence to back your claims.
t1_duejkqj	0	*	Are you giving Pence flack for not wanting to extradite someone for heresy?  Theocratic hell holes like most of the Middle East shouldnt have extradition treaties.

t1_dsg4lru	1	*	Mec
t1_dsf6dvp	1	*	Try coffee. I mix it with body wash instead of coconut oil so it doesn't give you that oily feeling afterwards. Bonus- you don't slip arse over tit in the shower!

t1_dur80qx	1	*	You sir, are correct. Never thought about it like that.

t1_dud91rs	0	*	Isn't it embarrassing to fermented-fetus when Redditors can't tell by his statements if he is a real American or a Russian operative? Either way their arguments are unconvincing.
t1_dud4mez	0	*	We learned new things because of these indictments. But I guess Russia attacking the U.S. doesn't matter to you.

t1_dud6no0	0	*	did you know everyone that disagrees with you is a bot, and if you actually believe that everyone that disagrees with you is a bot, you are disillusional
t1_due6toh	1	*	Yeah those 13 bloggers must've been pretty brilliant to completely upend the entire 2016 election and wreck political discourse in the United States. . . Oh wait . . . This is all total nonsense.
t1_dud3hgl	0	*	not saying I eat this kinda thing up, but there are some pretty scary theories about the Clintons
t1_dud94za	1	*	You can't argue with these guys, they think this is the culmination of Mueller's entire teams work, not the fact that Mueller has been slowly knocking out the legs of the table that support Trump.
t1_dud45as	1	*	It's not your fault. There is nothing saying you must vote strategically. 
t1_dudbqrm	1	*	So they voted for a literal crook?  One who has made his entire life about crookery, and makes no secret of that fact?  What exactly makes Clinton a crook?

t1_dud6g39	0	*	Just goes to prove that people are incredibly gullible for snake oil. I have some crates in my wagon, will heal any wound or elect any president.
t1_dud4lbo	1	*	To be fair, the Clinton campaign apparently didn't think votes in the Midwest mattered much either.
t1_dunvxl2	1	*	Congress has the authority to legislate sanctions. Trump signed the legislation into law, therefore he is constitutionally required to enforce it.

t1_duddl6z	1	*	In this election you are right.  But I feel they could have fielded a better candidate.
t1_dud2rq8	0	*	of course not. I've heard only bad things. I've met plenty of Russians though. not my favorite people.

t1_ducyaej	0	*	Well Watergate took about three years so... 2019/2020?
t1_dud5xgj	1	*	Thanks!
t1_dudb27r	1	*	That's completely wrong. If Trump ran as a Democrat they'd still vote for him.
t1_duf5ix3	1	*	Dude, no I am not a lawyer. I did not want to be a lawyer. You should try not being so condescending if you want someone to listen to you. 
t1_dud2xoi	1	*	Hes a lefty what do you expect

t1_due1oec	1	*	No, you.
t1_duda93t	0	*	It's also in the report that nothing they did affected the outcome of election.
t1_dud4lhu	0	*	That was a statistical analysis, not a conspiracy theory. And it was right, the likelihood that Trump would lose the popular vote and win the election was very small. 
t1_dudd14g	0	*	I think only those sympathetic to him believe that.   
t1_dud5z5p	1	*	Man you Righties love to use this according to your logic or according to you bullshit. All you do is warp the logic, twist the point and deflect. It's hilarious.
t1_dud5xol	0	*	*popcorn*
t1_ducxn5r	0	*	More like crossing your T's and dotting your I's. You establish Russians did criminally infiltrate the system, so when you go after American targets, they can't claim it was a witch hunt.

t1_dt0f8z8	0	*	No it relates to your last post and your attempts to limit any counter argument to your position. By avoiding my question you confirm what, no doubt, many of us suspect.

t1_ds5q51y	1	*	IDK, I'm kind of feeling it's all lost. There were 20 some people at this party and I was the only one that didn't support Trump.

t1_dv3xfa7	1	*	Checked your post history, yours is tame.  You have opinions she doesn't agree with, *and* you're a conservative.  Thus, she is now able to group you in with the alt right and call you a 'dotard'.  
t1_dv41cw8	1	*	Nope, worked in a much more male-dominated field than that.  Still not a problem.  There are douchebags and normal people everywhere, buddy.

t1_dv37u8x	0	*	No...the constant theme is, The Russians rigged the election by convincing Republicans to vote for Trump.  THAT is the constant theme there.  It's also a big theme in this very thread.  
t1_dv3poql	1	*	No one asked for academic essays. All that was asked for is proof. Being hostile and aggressive to try and prove your point is pretty off putting if you are trying to convince people man.

t1_dsf45nb	0	*	Which of those links do you think makes the strongest case that there is discrimination against white men?  I see potential discrimination against conservative opinions and that's it.
t1_dsf4bio	1	*	So is gluttony. 
t1_dsf6x78	1	*	Because they're hiring fewer women than men, would be the obvious answer.
t1_dsf4u10	1	*	Paying bonuses to people for threatening a colleague.. is pretty bad, no matter how you look at it.
t1_dsevkq0	0	*	So 10+ cases from a company with 70k people working is proof of systematic bias? And most of them are not related to being white men but being sexist or part of the far right.

t1_dsez6yl	1	*	Oh no, whatever should we do?! /s
t1_dsf497a	0	*	Yes and the lawsuit is because Damore believes a deciding factor in choosing who to employ is their gender, which is discrimination.   
t1_dsf20p9	0	*	So you're claiming female graduates are just better than their male counterparts so they can chose to go to Google, while men take the leftover jobs?
t1_dsex6lf	1	*	I don't agree with his point, but changing the genders in that particular sentence didn't alleviate anything. Why would it be sexist to call two women butthurt?
t1_dsf9yki	0	*	Yea because all those cameras everywhere in the UK just scream freedom.
t1_dsf3lrf	0	*	And they are still judged by the color of their skin. Blacks are less likely to be hired with the same CV as white people. So no, MLKs day isn't here.

t1_dsyhtu8	0	*	Here is the latest report: http://www.osce.org/special-monitoring-mission-to-ukraine/367271  To sum it up, the Ukrainian army keeps shelling the city of Donetsk. What the fuck are you talking about?
t1_dsxvetx	0	*	Yes a few run down/abandoned buildings on a guys blog means all of Abkhazia is shit.
t1_dsx2p9n	0	*	You are correct. Updated my post to mention Uzbekistan. 
t1_dtrulco	1	*	The only reason I didn't quit Twitter years ago is I have good usernames.  Hell half the reason I dont quit FB is I have a good username there too.
t1_dtrc0vz	0	*	Are you able to elaborate on why you think it's the ultimate form of an open social network? I've never used Twitter and I've been reconsidering it.

t1_dtrn3dw	1	*	Never said I wasn't. I'm a people. 
t1_dtrmezv	1	*	TV syndrome, maybe? The older generation assuming everyone's seen the same thing online because older media types showed the same thing to everyone. 
t1_dtrdoqi	1	*	Thousands of friends and pages sounds about right.  Wouldn't take forever and there's no reason to because nobody uses Facebook for anything other than messenger.

t1_dtrmy8p	1	*	Well if Reddit gets that big off of my suggestion then Im coming for some equity 
t1_dtrfiv1	1	*	Demographics matter though, and stats beyond total users. Maybe it's not a bubble but the trend is for actual screen time or actually clicking links which total user numbers don't indicate. 
t1_dtrbxpr	0	*	You been to Utah? The answer is no.

t1_dtrlmke	1	*	Yeah. Beside, I always feel like a stalker when I go and check somebody's profile. If I don't see any new posts from them in my timeline I automatically assume they haven't posted anything. 
t1_dtrb7zd	1	*	Wow. I thought I was twisted but now I see in normal.
t1_dtr9dge	0	*	Not at all. I wish I was born in a period of no internet to be quite frank. To much bullshit and it's dumbing down society.

t1_dtkweo3	0	*	It is an issue. Once the gene for resistance is available some of the bacteria will retain it and hence resistant strains will pop up fairly quickly.
t1_dtp634o	1	*	I dont think youre fully educated on gestation crates- not that I support them.
t1_dtkwt7v	1	*	The fact that our doctor went to school for almost 22 years and his University would fail in the US due to better competition.

t1_dthiccf	0	*	You didn't see the part where he fired the FBI director and then admitted on live television that it was because of this Russia thing? Are you sure you read the news?
t1_dthe736	0	*	The Czech (?) government confirmed that Trump's lawyer had never visited their country like the memo alleged he did. That's a big one.
t1_dthgajn	0	*	Nobody trusts the American Government so why should we trust them with our livelihood? 
t1_dthi41k	0	*	But you ignored all evidence of his claim.

t1_dthptfl	0	*	That's a great counter-argument, congratulations you win.

t1_dthkkkx	0	*	Dude, you began your post stating Obama was the first president you thought was good at everything. Why the hell would anyone read anything else you say? 
t1_dthnnbp	1	*	Fair point. This is totally true.

t1_dthf9jz	1	*	Thank you proving my point
t1_dthb50s	0	*	You just made that up. At no point ever has Steele backtracked on the dossier. 
t1_dthcwmg	0	*	True true, but the whole blackmail/Trump under Putin's thumb aspect relies on the piss tape.

t1_dthifjl	0	*	Looks like you are correct there. The RNC themselves never paid Fusion GPS. Your initial post was still incorrect though. The DNC paid Fusion GPS but never hired Steele.

t1_dtgla9k	0	*	No. Are you saying we are at war with Iran and NK, and previously Cuba? 
t1_dthtpj5	1	*	That would be an interesting defense of the continuing resolution.

t1_dtvxzpi	1	*	I would take these kinds of weeks myself, but only high-seniority bus drivers have the option of 4-day/10 hour shift work weeks, and they get shafted on same-day overtime. 
t1_dtvxo05	0	*	Is money worth not having friends that actually care for you? Because I can imagine rich folks have a lot of friends that only care for their money and dont give a shit about them.
t1_dtvvywo	0	*	Its a generational gap. My parents both had 20+ years at the same place. Younger people bounce around a lot more, which IMO, is the best way to keep the salary increases coming. 
t1_dtw10gq	1	*	Life is hard, but thankfully, short. 
t1_dtwpqr7	1	*	Nice as well, but sadly dead and not exactly my style. (To be fair: much better than most of the listed under comedians though.)
t1_dtw0p0u	1	*	Try it some time and get back to me. 
t1_dtwc1lg	1	*	If it was paid time off, man, I'd be dancing into that OT.
t1_dtzseyb	0	*	Was it as cool as it sounds?
t1_du7gfka	1	*	it's more than a year; it won't make you look bad. your dad *is* an idiot here.
t1_dtvzhg2	1	*	Ive done 14 and 21 day long shifts of 10 hr days with a week off between  it aint so bad. 21 sucked but 14 was fine. Money was amazing
t1_dtvz5s8	1	*	What drew you to farming?
t1_dtw3itw	1	*	Pass.
t1_dtvwdpr	0	*	Again, can you state your arguments and not talk in riddles?
t1_dtw2axg	0	*	What about the costs to society? People who don't have jobs sometimes get into crime to put food on the table. Workers get burnt out and compensate by drinking and doing drugs.
t1_dtvylor	0	*	Because we are living in late stage capitalism?
t1_dtvy6yw	0	*	In other words, who cares if there are only *a few* slaves? Also, historically, this country *was literally* founded on slave labor. 
t1_dtvzcoa	1	*	Yup, my job is to automate out unskilled labour.
t1_duxajo8	1	*	I would disagree on that, you should back up your claim. Many, many two parent households have to working adults in order to make ends meet.
t1_dtvw571	1	*	Most investment bankers working the long hours are people in their early 20s. I doubt they have maid service.
t1_dtvx3gu	1	*	Just wondering are you living in the US,  because if you think being a slave is better then living here, arrangements can be made to send you to a country where it exists. 
t1_dtw4pae	1	*	I am 19 m8. And the reason I don't feel like living there are mostly political.
t1_dtvzo2d	1	*	>Ah, slavery  FTFY
t1_dtvxf16	0	*	Former investment banker here. You don't need cocaine to do mundane edits to powerpoints at 4am. 
t1_dtw0gwl	0	*	I've done 4x10s and 9x80s (9 hour days M-R, 8 hours one Friday and off the other).  Don't like 4x10s. Love 9x80s.
t1_dtvwhhu	0	*	Oh, youre one of those people. I bet you hate the police too?
t1_dv1c1ln	1	*	Only thing that gets me to sleep is a combination of whiskey, melatonin, and diphenhydramine, insomnia can be a bitch when you can't afford medical care.
t1_dsllqmf	1	*	God forbid they compete that never leads to amazing advancements or anything...
t1_dv0n554	0	*	Exactly, just like Russia would get obliterated if America wished to obliterate them
t1_dv2nqfw	0	*	The one reporting the number is a Russian employee of Wagner not a U.S. military official... Either you didn't listen to the audio or you are intentionally pushing propaganda. Which one is it?
t1_dv2633z	0	*	Those who are still alive will envy the dead 
t1_dv0t2m2	0	*	Ok then. The dinosaurs died of something else? Please explain.
t1_dv1pv3m	1	*	oh im retarded
t1_dv15uy8	1	*	But Brazil is an American ally too.   I mean the Rio Pact is mostly a technicality at this point but its still more official than anything Russia has with them 
t1_dv0p96y	0	*	well the record low temp was on 89-90c in antartica
t1_dv0no7d	0	*	yeahhhh yeahhhh
t1_dtdmued	0	*	If the sleeping bag was that important, the homeless person would keep it with them.
t1_dtd05tz	0	*	A 2 bed starter home in London is going to cost you about $650k
t1_dtdbxf6	0	*	Oh yeah? Like who?
t1_dtdgmjt	1	*	Exactly, not enough facts for us to make an decisions
t1_dtczmpk	0	*	That you can call anything murder but it is a defined by a legal definition not a persons emotional reaction  to something (yours). 
t1_dtdlyks	1	*	just google why you don't want to stay in a homeless shelter plenty of news articles exposing abuses
t1_dtd1m0w	0	*	TBH it seems that any collection of Americans results in rape of some kind whether it's an interview for a movie part, college parties, prisons or homeless shelters.
t1_dtdjlyn	1	*	A 3 bedroom home in Vegas or Dallas/Fort Worth is under 200k theres no way prices are higher in Kansas.  Median home price in Kansas is around 165k for a big 1,500 sq/ft house.  
t1_dtd1ewc	0	*	Sounds like he is saying *Some* homeless people are those things.
t1_dtd26pm	0	*	It's almost like if you shove 50 homeless people with no screening for mental illness or temperament or drugs into a building meant for 20 that you may have a bit of an unsafe environment.  
t1_dtd1bhm	1	*	Like the most of us, my man, you are a helpless human. 
t1_dtvg10x	1	*	Yes or help them for water
t1_du0c60k	1	*	*Can you feel- my hatred for gay skaters on the ice*   *It makes people think we're gay*
t1_dtzb9ja	0	*	You asked for an archaic belief of his. I named one. Theres more but I picked the dumbest one. 
t1_dtzykly	1	*	I never suggested otherwise
t1_dtzkiaw	0	*	He is a bigot. He doesnt believe that gay Americans should have the same rights and protections as the rest of us b/c they are attracted the same sex. What is that, if not a bigoted stance?
t1_dtzfa8g	1	*	I think youre misinformed, you silly girl.
t1_dtz9ch8	1	*	Yes, and neither deserves respect.
t1_dtzt7kp	0	*	Resistance to intolerance is not intolerance. Are you mad people are fed up with intolerant people? Should intolerance be tolerated?
t1_dtzi99y	1	*	They are, in this case. Who's calling the wolf now then? 
t1_dtzzqax	0	*	I enjoy conversations with people who choose their words carefully.
t1_dtzfqxd	1	*	Yes because calling someone an idiot is equal to institutionalized bigotry. Im no one, hes the VP of the United States.
t1_dtzk66m	1	*	Hahaha
t1_du00oem	1	*	Wear flats?
t1_du04uss	1	*	Voter suppression tactics. You should read about them. 
t1_dtzn9jq	0	*	Great, go ahead and give Mike Pence the 60 year old bigot who believes gay people should use shock therapies that he's wrong.
t1_dtzti5s	1	*	And they're mad that other people are openly expressing it and flaunting it in their faces and they are super *jealous* of that fact.
t1_dtzxrhr	1	*	They chose to appear straight, but you can't choose your sexuality anymore than a dog can choose to be vegetarian.
t1_dtz8uue	1	*	He's saying the athlete is direspectful.
t1_du0afe6	0	*	Phew. Feels like I'm drowning in here sometime.  Even if we break one person's conditioning it's worth it.  Communist subversion is real.
t1_du0aedu	0	*	If you're okay with calling Obama anti-gay, then sure, we agree.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhp_DDHe_X0
t1_dtzibs6	0	*	I'm not seeing the hypocrisy, since everyone follows the same rules.
t1_dtzgpuf	0	*	And some I assume are good people. 
t1_du0eu4t	0	*	And you ignore the rest of my statement on the issue. Man you are just a sad little troll aren't you?
t1_dtzmcz1	0	*	Being openly anti-LGBT is harmful. You asked what harms the community. Legitimizing bigotry does.
t1_dtz77xb	0	*	Not at all. No one should be rewarded for any degree of bigotry.
t1_du0f2li	1	*	Woman's gotta do what a woman's gotta do.
t1_dtzlj25	0	*	Neat. Queer person who bought into the idea that everyone needs to pretend to *be* straight. It's not much better.
t1_dtzfbql	0	*	...The series has 8 seasons, I don't remember every single quote from it other than the most memorable ones.
t1_dtzmqds	0	*	there wasn't anything technical about it, as though the actual statement would be different from 'technically, _____', the use of 'technically' is redundant and using it isn't stylised  
t1_du0esu3	0	*	Care to back up this fact or...
t1_dtzzf2e	0	*	He takes bar flirting to a whole new level
t1_du4rdaf	1	*	Fair enough. Thank you!
t1_dtzffdt	0	*	Looks like Trump has literally 0 arguments then. Good to know.
t1_du034cx	0	*	You can talk to me instead of a mirror, you know...
t1_dtzfgoh	1	*	I think we all know.
t1_du0k0qh	1	*	Do you perform it on a different instrument while the kazoo is in your ass or on the kazoo? In the latter case I demand a video (sfw please)
t1_dtznwab	0	*	Idk, why dont you ask him? All I know is hes made it clear hes not against them existing, so the OP said something categorically false. 
t1_dtzgrev	0	*	> as soon as players kneeled during the anthem.  And this was at the height of those protests, it was all but certain that the players would be kneeling, he knew he wasn't staying at the game.
t1_dtzxh57	1	*	Illegal immigrants are the modern day slaves of the democrats, they are on the wrong side of history!
t1_dtztub3	0	*	Well we both hate communists!
t1_du0cy3x	0	*	That is homophobic....are you seriously pulling the nice people argument?
t1_dtzsfr6	0	*	sad.
t1_du06hl8	1	*	how else to explain the trick names as if they were sports anime attack names?
t1_du00s4u	1	*	The problem is, like with most hotly debated things, that the answer is a little bit of both. 
t1_du02j0o	1	*	Pence is a piece of shit.
t1_du01dyl	0	*	Liberal to monarchs maybe? 
t1_du1qnzg	0	*	yeah sure
t1_dtzksrq	1	*	You need a hug, don't you?
t1_du0yzjh	1	*	I mean, technically some women contain lactose, too... 
t1_duti6xg	0	*	Oh are they dying and at what rate?
t1_dut5diq	0	*	Ok show me how it is wrong
t1_dut5l8l	0	*	Am a chemist IRL; can confirm that the poster is full of shit. No peer-reviewed citations, no physics, no chemistry is found in his post. Just bullshit speculation that makes sense in his head.
t1_ds4oj92	1	*	2/10
t1_ds427tt	0	*	Yes it is. When the alternative is Communism. 
t1_ds42846	0	*	never said that
t1_ds484wh	0	*	Username does not check out
t1_ds44pls	0	*	How much is a Yen worth?   This is the most idiotic comment of the day. Congratulations. 
t1_ds48fnc	0	*	It's a bit more complicated than that.
t1_ds465yn	0	*	Pakistan has been aligned with them almost its entire existence. It was Pakistan actually that started diplomacy between the US and China. Dude just stop. 
t1_dte7wjl	1	*	Because it didn't want to...
t1_du89bmt	1	*	He's Canadian 
t1_dsjs3b7	0	*	The person donating the money can do what he wants with it. Who are you to say where he should donate his money too? What do you mean make it real? You're not making any sense man. 
t1_dsk83b4	1	*	You're joking right? Having a bit of fun trolling on something as serious as mental illness? That's nice. 
t1_dsk7i8b	1	*	So then I guess, it's a win-win situation here. No wonder rich people donate large amounts of money. 
t1_dtkm8s3	0	*	Don't you make fun of Canadian beer!! Especially not from a country that drinks Coors Light and Budweiser. 
t1_dtk65qz	0	*	You people are arguing over an imaginary character...
t1_dtk9azx	1	*	Ffs.  That's what I get for only reading headlines
t1_dtlcz63	0	*	Elizabeth II is literally the [Queen of Canada.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarchy_of_Canada)
t1_dtjw0dv	0	*	I honestly would find it even stranger if a white artist, during the Renaissance, randomly started depicting god as a small chinese woman. 
t1_dtkel4q	1	*	I rather a government that functions.  Also that's the lower house, having an elected Senate wouldn't change that.
t1_dseut8a	0	*	That's just not true. Ringling used to tour with a whole team of veterinarians, many of whom had been working with the individual animals for decades. 
t1_dsev26s	0	*	If they were as rare as tigers in a post meat eating society than maybe?  And we do have small petting zoos even today with farm animals so a small niche market would be possible.
t1_dsfkaef	1	*	Ha, that's about as good as it gets. Have my updoot, as meaningless as it may be :)
t1_duom63q	0	*	They are terrible. Jimmy Dore is OK, so no wonder he left them.
t1_duos7wu	0	*	...and then you learn that they are financed with money from right-wingers and anonymous shady investor groups.  Seriously, I regret ever listening to their content.
t1_dupje5x	0	*	Yeah, amongst upper-middleclass teenage girls.  Literally never met anyone else who played field hockey in my entire life.
t1_dupjfjq	1	*	So, are we ever allowed to cast judgement on anyone or anything?
t1_duozph7	1	*	I was like that, once upon a time. Some days I wish I could go back and slap the shit out of my younger self 
t1_dup656y	1	*	WOLFPAC! Ahh.... those were the days..
t1_dupv5wd	1	*	Popular enough that it's difficult to get into a club in come cities.
t1_dup4pof	1	*	Do you benefit financially, culturally, & socially from the actions of the perpetrator like Turkish citizens do?
t1_duontfi	1	*	Well said.
t1_duoyo31	0	*	Reparations help make up for what happened. How can you not understand that paying Armenians back will help set it right? 
t1_dup4vzg	0	*	On the 3. Oct. 2010 we gemans finished paying off the war dept for WW1.  Last year we also payed a final reparation for something else aswell... dunno what though
t1_dupb0fa	1	*	I mean, this is absolutely some sins of the father shit. People usually don't like that.
t1_dup1qv2	1	*	Oh yeah ofc. The whole reason for NATOs intervention was the genocide. 
t1_duoyq81	0	*	For the 2nd time, yes. 
t1_dup6nvi	1	*	Potassium benzoate isn't bad on toppings, it only forms benzene with the presence of ascorbic acid, and even then it had been found that the amount of benzene is negligible. 
t1_dup5kft	0	*	We are paying the African countries too much already. 
t1_dupfy5w	1	*	Pretty big as well.
t1_duplpls	1	*	Just like they couldn't afford to nuke the US. Doesn't mean US should give up on their AA defences. It is a failsafe basically.
t1_dv49yq0	1	*	My doctor hasn't informed me yet.
t1_dshhxg0	0	*	If Russia can't prove in any way that the drone is American, but they were pretty sure it is, what would they do, I wonder?
t1_dsihgem	0	*	What about Ukraine? What did Russia do to Ukraine?
t1_dshn7cz	0	*	Technically it is, if the drones are under the control of Syrian rebels, and the US was only gifting the drones to them.
t1_duray5a	0	*	Yeah but I more meant like what do you do if you leave Japan for 1-2 mos 
t1_dur8xzz	0	*	Sounds like a lot of work...just put fluoride in the water supply
t1_durxae2	1	*	Even if it were the same strain several years in a row, the shots immunity only lasts ~2 years max. 
t1_duysih4	0	*	It's a theocratical police state, that many facist would be pleased with  
t1_dtnwzww	0	*	Communist were a minority in the minority.
t1_dtmnujj	0	*	Anything that helps destroy socialist/communists is my kink
t1_ds7xkum	1	*	I do that already tho :p I regularly feed the kitty family outside my apartment and I bring some pet food wherever I go in case I meet some cuties!
t1_ds2femo	0	*	>  It hasn't really gotten us anywhere in the last 50 years.  are you sure about that? how sure? why?
t1_ds2m3mw	1	*	Essentially a carrier can park out of range of land based anti ship missiles and spam away, while surface ships and subs will never be able to do so.
t1_ds2hi0z	0	*	Uhhhh the destroyers all have point defense. They would be covering the carrier. 
t1_dtwfsik	1	*	This is a chain with 5 star hotels in London not a shitty chain.
t1_du25xi1	0	*	Yeah, its gotta be the big ones. Years ago, I went to the 1700s themed restaurant at Greenfield Village in Dearborn and was tickled because their straws were the big bucatini pasta. 
t1_duj9ci2	1	*	I never suggested it's testing nuclear response. It's rather testing security.  That's where you can claim a mistaken happened.  These are obviously just theories though.
t1_duhpkxh	0	*	Because when america sends white guys overseas they're not sending their best.  They're sending rapists and drug dealers and some I assume are good people.
t1_duhr3vz	0	*	You good my friend, I don't know shit about this, I'm just lookin for excuses to post Spaceballs gifs lol
t1_duifm1y	1	*	Oh, I see. What an interesting way to have to live. I couldn't imagine it.
t1_duikzh8	1	*	freezer jam is the shit!
t1_duhlbjy	1	*	Hold on, Larry. I need to get the WiFi password.
t1_dto9nnp	1	*	as time goes by the things that we used to know as common knowledge would get forgotten.   even the Moro in the philiphines are now just lumped up together with other muslim terrorists.
t1_dtnln61	0	*	i think they dont care much about civilian casualites as they have killed thousands very quickly
t1_dtnty3u	0	*	The British was partitioning so many countries. Just look at India.
t1_dto054y	0	*	>we  LOL. Judaism like all religions needs to be wiped out. Parasitic nonsense where you can claim an entire section of land to belong to yours and your people. Ahah. 
t1_dtnqq80	1	*	1947 through 1967, these people lived and worked right alongside the Israelis, and it never occurred to them that they were in fact Palestinian. 
t1_dtntu8g	0	*	Thank you for your effort
t1_dtopyqa	0	*	How high are they on the Ethnocracy index. Need to see a chart for that.
t1_dtorm0u	1	*	It holds millions of Palestinians as stateless non-citizens within its borders. How is it not an apartheid state?
t1_dto5jjd	1	*	Well not me, anyway. Americans and Israelis are pretty similar in my eyes.
t1_dtndvcy	0	*	a government did it, that makes it right   If you stole my house I'd push you into the sea 100%. 
t1_dtnw0cl	0	*	[A lot has changed since you've left](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UfLrx3cQoRY)
t1_dtnr479	1	*	Strange no mention of the actions of the Arab Liberation Army previous to the Palestinian Exodus. The bias is strong with this one...
t1_dtnemg2	1	*	All valid points.
t1_dtnel42	0	*	Who's was it?
t1_dto05tc	0	*	Happy you've found something nice in life !
t1_dtno8ut	0	*	The biblical Jewish claim is irrelevant yes, though many settlers and such believe in their divine right to the land.
t1_dto3rko	1	*	Oh, no, pretty sure people are going to find it genuine.  I mean it's not far off, and an opinion that pops up in r/worldnews from time to time. 
t1_dtnxlz4	0	*	What about Syria and Lebanon and Jordan? They partitioned that with the French too and pissed off arabs living in the area as well 
t1_dtndvc8	0	*	TiL accurate characterizations = rewriting history when the conclusions don't support the whitewash pizza-partie wants to sell.
t1_ds1alyr	0	*	n = 1
t1_ds26abw	1	*	Interesting because hundreds of thousands if not millions have already died from malnutrition or starvation in North Korea. 
t1_ds889i1	0	*	Ok you seem like a bit of an assumptive cunt.
t1_ds80ar3	0	*	You were already corrected to company instead of society. And the answer is that a CEO can bankrupt his company or ensure that it flourishes. 
t1_ds8afiv	0	*	Yes. They have more people show up in person, but fewer people watch on TV. I wouldn't be surprised if more people showed up just because the tickets are cheaper.
t1_ds7buw0	0	*	If you support capitalism then you have to support everything that happens under capitalism. Anybody that supports capitalism must support the poor and homeless dying from lack of food and shelter.
t1_ds7ou83	0	*	Well aware. Most labor is easily replaceable. Thats why they are paid so little. 
t1_ds7duhp	0	*	The way you speak, you won't be around to find that out
t1_ds7xut7	1	*	> 90% of *federal income tax*  
t1_ds8no6k	1	*	The employee should be paid the value of their work, so i agree with your first statement.
t1_ds97983	1	*	in terms of wages the current system is fine, there could be county level changes (up and down) in the minimum wage though.
t1_dsblqcb	1	*	No really, valet parking for example.  Every luxury hotel should have, but you can not automate this job for now.  A low wage in this position is not a problem, it's a job for students or teenagers.
t1_ds8659i	0	*	I know you're not one the same way I know that your business has only one employee, namely yourself. 
t1_ds2z1cc	1	*	We live six hours from his lodge, which is the closest we've been to it in the six years we've known each other.
t1_dta3s6b	0	*	What you're advocating is laicism, not secularism.
t1_dsnjtlw	1	*	Well youre going to need some pretty tight pants for them to stay around your head as a hat so I dont think you need a belt, but if it gives you piece of mind go a head and get a belt too.
t1_dtrg7xk	1	*	Cheaper, and would likely lead to a lower loss of human life.
t1_dtr9hmc	1	*	True that! Bad incentive though ;)
t1_du9qy5u	0	*	The popular theory ive seen in various scifi novels is star forming. Theres probably an official term, but basically taking mass off the star to cool it down and extend its lifespan. 
t1_duaa1i6	1	*	Thats the point. You think missile projects arent subject to the same government practices? You should look into the mess we call SLS
t1_du97ltj	0	*	There's a philosophical idea that the entire universe is conscious, down to the subatomic level. So life didn't arise from Death, it has always been inherent to the universe.
t1_du97yzb	0	*	Well that's cheery. I guess I'll go home and drink myself into oblivion.
t1_du9k08v	1	*	Well, I assume there will be plenty of scavenging that can be done.
t1_dubibst	1	*	Some are even still going, we need to ask the birds and crocodillians the answer.
t1_dua1nzd	1	*	Don't worry, they're working on all kinds of ways to disrupt the global ecosystem and create lots of dead biomatter at once.
t1_du8jq1x	0	*	We're talking about space weapons, you are blaming America for some reason.    You are proposing what?  Disarming while Russia and China develop weapons?
t1_du9bgds	0	*	Well I got completely sucked down that rabbit hole
t1_du9r1g5	1	*	Yes.
t1_du94m0f	0	*	We are a way for the universe to know itself.
t1_du8jks9	1	*	>We should do nothing, we have our own weapons   I was replying to the guy that was blaming America for YOUR weapons
t1_du98qtv	1	*	You'll have to forgive them, reading comprehension isn't typically focused on until the 4th grade.
t1_dua51ne	1	*	Honestly if we collectively decided to just stop copulating like goddamn rabbits we could slow the wild ride to our doom considerably.  Of course that'll never happen though.
t1_du96cc2	0	*	Well, in my defense I was taught at the university that Enigma wasn't a computer. It had more to do with automaton. And automaton aren't enough to be considered computers. 
t1_du9dtcn	1	*	You are most welcome! :)
t1_du9ieij	0	*	We'd get to Steam tech pretty quickly with wood but it would be still pretty rudimentary. 
t1_du998re	0	*	I suppose the term ARPANET means nothing to you then?
t1_du9or11	1	*	Oh, I see you've been to Australia, prior to the arrival of beer.
t1_duaf9j8	1	*	According to that wiki it's much more than 100 My. Calm down.
t1_du9upbp	1	*	Ya but do we need the fields of cotton and to waste polyester on the 99c billions of valentines day crap thats going in the trash tomorrow
t1_dubge8b	1	*	Only ~2.8 billion years until there's not even evidence we were ever here :(
t1_du93lqn	1	*	what could save us better than a cloud of reflective debris removing 5-7% of light?
t1_du8nth9	0	*	Ah, the good ole taxation = theft bullshit.  Fine, don't pay taxes.  But you'd better stop driving on my roads, and never collect or use any type of government benefits.  Fair is fair.
t1_dua4jg2	1	*	Nuke ourselves to the stone age does not literally mean returning to stone age tech. Books are perfectly able to survive a nuclear winter.
t1_du9f76j	0	*	Too bad modern society will probably fail within the next decade, will be fun to watch it burn though
t1_du93ua0	0	*	So, no, you don't have any sources and we'll just have to take your word that you read it somewhere?
t1_du95vyg	1	*	good point!
t1_du9c28t	1	*	Not to mention, Rudolph Diesel's first internal-combustion engine ran on vegetable oil, not petroleum.
t1_dsp86wc	0	*	Thanks for enlightening me, I didnt know what it was called in political science language.  If government is the will of the people, then it ought to be structured and operate as such.

t1_duor1cv	0	*	Yes, you are, by saying they cant regain the land that was stolen.
t1_duoxpzf	1	*	35 years ago... and that's not all apartheid is defined by. Even if you were right, I don't see how that changes the point.
t1_duo61m1	0	*	So. Just... low intelligence in general and not able to defend your point.  Got it.   But hey dad... you do you.

t1_dtynez0	1	*	Or just turn the ship around and when the 'weapon' get close enough, fire the rocket engines at the weapon and blow it apart at the same time you begin moving away from it.      its something...
t1_dtz7nmy	0	*	>The cost of one seat on the Soyuz for NASA is about the same cost as the entire Falcon Heavy launch.  Only for NASA, not for the Russians. And yet NASA prefers not to use Falcon.

t1_dss82rk	0	*	No doubt, but were the smithies owners so influential that they got a say in politics or public policy like most large arms businesses in America do today?
t1_dssiddm	1	*	Subsidize defense for half the world, not just Europe.  Japan, Korea, the Philippines, Canada.
t1_dsrvqp6	0	*	the word whataboutism was popularized because they hate being called out on their hypocrisy.
t1_dsthf0f	0	*	It never changes
t1_dsshvdk	1	*	Because the US has never missed a payment, and treasury bonds hold their value really well. US debt is a good place for countries to store value in their currencies.

t1_dthw8wl	1	*	You assume.
t1_dumoo0s	0	*	If you look at those studies, then you'll see they are of low quality and samples amount to anecdotal evidence. This is typical headline study to run scare stories in the media.
t1_dun2yl2	1	*	we're already looking at 3 times the risk with 14 units though.
t1_dumda88	0	*	Just because something is good for the heart doesn't mean it's good for the brain, particularly considering that alcohol achieves it's effects *by* fucking with your brain.

t1_dulnls1	0	*	It's pretty stupid to take a position on a substance completely missing from the medical literature despite it having been used for most of human history *just because.*
t1_dumnd1i	1	*	That's the recommended maximum consumption*. The recommended medical consumption of alcohol is 0.
t1_dv7o36x	1	*	If only we had some way to tell if this type of story was credible for anything.
t1_dunhfbj	0	*	If only there were some stats available on those dangerous weed junkies roaming the streets for their next high.

t1_dullr8q	0	*	/r/stopdrinking is a portable community 
t1_dult2u1	1	*	Considering weed has been used for almost all of human history with zero stimga attributed to it until the 60s... yeah. It's not that stupid of a position to take. 
t1_dun2xu3	1	*	A unit is 250ml of 4% AVB. An average beer is 300ml, 330ml or 500ml depending if you have a bottle, small can, or big can, and is 5%.

t1_dtey5lz	0	*	Ya weird how its still a boys club in positions of actual power. Absolutely nothing to do with gender discrimination.  
t1_dtf6k5x	1	*	He said that in a specific letter to a specific church for specific reasons. Elsewhere in other letters he speaks of women teaching men, and favourably. 
t1_dtf6mym	0	*	Spiritual abuse is a real thing.  But it's not representative of the whole faith. 
t1_dtfbfcg	0	*	Why would a supposedly omnipotent being allow the existence of a being like Satan?
t1_dtezdm1	1	*	Yeah except for places like that town in france that actually did make it illegal. Idk if they still have that rule or how strongly they enforce it, but there definitely is some cause to protest.
t1_dtf779g	0	*	> Do you have reading comprehension issues? Would you like to point out where I claimed that?  
t1_dtezjvy	0	*	So? Atheist neckbeards will neckbeard I guess...  You remind me of when I was twelve on my anti-religious crusades, *shudder*
t1_dteuqc7	0	*	I get what he's saying. After a certain period comments are often just someone else saying basically the same thing that's been said in 5 other comments 
t1_dtexmxc	0	*	Shhh youre ruining the Islamophobes circlejerk. He wants to make Islam seem inherently inferior to other religions. 
t1_dtf61du	0	*	Yes, actually. 
t1_dtewa42	0	*	Do you think people were having the same conversations about guilt and conscience after slavery? Nobody is saying masculinity in itself is a problem. The problem lies in inflicting that on others.
t1_dtfeeof	1	*	> I just posed a question about the legitimacy  don't do that  the narrative is not to be questioned  
t1_dtevp09	0	*	I can barely even finish typing a comment before it feels awkward and I delete it.

t1_dtfmfac	0	*	Mabuhay
t1_dtf4ne3	0	*	You don't have to be an expert on feminism to understand that women are treated differently than men, even in western countries. 
t1_dtfl3jb	1	*	Why even make vague analogies? It was a simple question lol
t1_dtf8r53	0	*	All this is true, but yes I am talking about another countrys human rights. After all, isnt that the subject of the post? 
t1_dtfq65k	1	*	Agreed.
t1_dtf41fu	0	*	I hate when people very vague terms like liberals, like myself, and then go on to describe things that I do not believe in anyway.   Cant we use a *little* nuance these days? 
t1_dtf2tsu	0	*	How many billions has the current government spent on Hezbollah and Hamas? Maybe they should spend that money on the Iranian people?
t1_dtfk9lw	0	*	I've had a circumcision as an adult man. Simply put, you are wrong. I probably wouldn't do it  over again given the chance, but hearing what happens to many women makes me cringe. 
t1_dtey0wy	0	*	So you think NOW is the entirety of feminism, gotcha.
t1_dtfixjl	1	*	I didn't know what IIRC meant, my bad. And yeah that makes a decent amount of sense, if you've taken a course on the subject I will defer to you as I have not yet done so.
t1_dteymkm	0	*	Not you you, just referring generally to all groups and people
t1_dtf9peo	1	*	>  and actually achieve something for men's rights as - ironically - feminism has been doing.  lol
t1_dtewgd3	0	*	Is it the same for the boys, with whom you crack open a cold one?
t1_dtf7u1i	1	*	10/10
t1_dtfnik0	0	*	Like a penis removed and the scrotum sewed such that it needs to be cut or torn to have sexual intercourse?    Yeah, that's your general everyday male circumcision. /s
t1_dtexnun	0	*	How does any of that have to do with feminism?
t1_dtfarrw	0	*	Because one of the themes of the protest was religious discrimination, and Trump was talking about banning Muslims from entering the country.
t1_dtfkacf	0	*	Buddhism a s practiced in Thailand and Burma is the minority branch
t1_dtfhme9	0	*	Difference being that only one religion's theocracies still have that kind of shit in modern laws... Or even still has theocracies, for that matter

t1_dtfl9l5	0	*	Then go get an attorney and sue. It won't go through, though, because it never happened and you're making this up for internet points.
t1_dtevn73	0	*	Its called football you idiot, burn in hell for calling it soccer what blasphemy. 
t1_dtf1s41	0	*	I'm the cunt and yet you're the one throwing insults around? Try some self-awareness, friend.
t1_dtezwd1	0	*	Well, yeah, it sounds like Dave is pretty angry
t1_dtf3l5x	1	*	You might even say it transgenders. 
t1_dtf0f18	0	*	Of course not, that was not my point at all. My point was that this part of the definition states it fights on behalf of *women's* rights and interests, not both sexes.
t1_dtfaqvj	0	*	Maybe hijab isn't forced in many muslim families but women do face consequences if they decide not to wear one. They may be even disowned for it. It isn't forcing but at the same time, it kinda is.
t1_dtf6mj7	0	*	Woah self entiteled dick,  how about no ? And no you're wrong, ever hear those words ??
t1_dteumvk	0	*	How??
t1_dtfomu8	1	*	You say that like most people don't see the difference. You are a minority my friend. And thank god for that.
t1_dtew3wi	0	*	Cool you took some hyperbolic language literally. Do you actually take her quote to represent all of feminism? 
t1_dtevt1q	0	*	Yeah to me bro is pretty much a gender neutral term at this point
t1_dtf8n5j	1	*	Fair enough. Yes I think we were just agreeing with each other and arguing about it haha. 
t1_dtfi4cb	0	*	What because we accidentally discovered Viagra? How's that baldness treatment coming? Should be done by now since we've got the time to invent useless shit like IUD's.  Fuck off with your bullshit.

t1_dtfp3b6	1	*	This. I'm amazed we're afraid to say this now. 
t1_dtfneuq	1	*	That is precisely why intersectional feminism is so important, but I am pretty sure you hate that as well. 
t1_dtexn7k	0	*	Dudes and dudettes.
t1_dtf2iac	0	*	It is pretty easy to see that Muslim dominate nations have a culture of real mysogyny. You don't have to be practicing Islam to see the oppression of it.

t1_dtf2h3c	1	*	:)
t1_dtfonyh	1	*	Fair enough.

t1_dtez8t7	0	*	He is. 
t1_dtf64l9	0	*	Explain how he's wrong. He's the only one not using hyperbole. If women's rights were non-existent, then she would be dead already along with the 5 others.
t1_dtf9onv	1	*	jfc the only reason i responded to the OP was because he brought up examples of Islamic extremism in America, where AFAIK, it's not codified into law here either. 
t1_dteulrj	0	*	It's also not a place to put down the feminists of America, which is how this whole thread of comments even started. 
t1_dtf0dck	1	*	If you're going to speak about Buddhism in those sorts of monolithic terms, you're making the same mistakes as those who do the same about Islam or Christianity.
t1_dtv66dx	1	*	My little shithole would be Texas. Born and raised.
t1_dtfptm2	0	*	Oh ok.    Yeah plenty of Christian countries do that.  I wouldnt get all high and mighty about what religion treats women best.
t1_dtf1f4w	1	*	Yup. When gender equality was achieved, feminism slowly turned from let's get equality (for women, because we're oppressed) to female supremacy.
t1_dtf5nav	1	*	9/11 with Condoleeza Rice

t1_dtew92j	1	*	Yes, I agree.
t1_dteygme	1	*	>But we have to recognize their privilege if we are going to have an honest conservation.  That's the entire point of intersectionality.

t1_du2gb1u	0	*	It's all valid, though. We have reached a turning point. The GOP is a puppet of the russian government, and they're bad for America.

t1_ds2bgil	1	*	>Benevolent sexism vs Hostile sexism  >You garner protections under the first, if you accept and integrate the sexism as normal.   **You gain nothing**
t1_ds1vvbu	0	*	All your arguments contain a grain of truth. I agree to some extent with a lot of them, but you present them so feverishly and subjectively that they're difficult to take seriously.

t1_duwo2ex	0	*	American doctors have to get you stable in the ER, they have no legal obligation if you aren't going to die right then.
t1_duwo66y	0	*	No, because Alberta cannot afford to pay for all of it;  only Quebec gets that sweet sweet transfer payment largess.
t1_duy8dfv	1	*	Youre also an extreme outlier.
t1_dux4dg9	1	*	It doesnt say that. Thats extrapolating on the comment pretty heavily.
t1_duwoebn	0	*	Even as a separatist myself, you are wrong. Quxe9bec is different, but you can't know for sure is better. It's very subjective the fact to think a  nation is just better than another one.
t1_duwuw1a	0	*	It doesn't.  We're discussing the cost of going to school in relation to the average wage a college student can make in a summer.  Area of study isn't even tertiarily involved in this conversation.

t1_duxkqx5	0	*	That's a pretty shitty thing to say to someone sick enough to qualify for a medical marijuana card in a state like nj. Yeah, actually, it does suck. Thanks for asking

t1_duwrcou	0	*	Oh okay Im not aware of how things are in Canada, my bad. 
t1_duwob3t	1	*	Fair enough. 
t1_duwpsxk	0	*	yeah I've been to some of the nicest hospitals and eye clinics in the area I live by a major city, a large majority of patients were low income and they were treated like everyone else.

t1_duwste7	1	*	I'm guessing they saw something about Tylenol being pretty unsafe for an OTC drug and they took it as something against all western medicine. 
t1_duwx2um	0	*	Jesus ... It always baffles me how much you pay for school, but I guess that at least community colleges are far cheaper?
t1_duwm6do	1	*	I didn't say that; PmUrHomoskedasticity did, but I see your point. I misinterpreted your response.
t1_duwykhn	1	*	I'm accumulating 43 dollars A DAY in med school loans INTEREST. The income mostly goes to paying it down.
t1_duwru9q	0	*	Hey, he did lose the weight. 
t1_duwly04	0	*	Every time they proposed an increase, students here fought it. It's a 40-year struggle. That's why education in Quebec is so much more affordable than the RoC.

t1_dux7fcn	1	*	Its a spambot
t1_duwrpz3	0	*	The only breakdown seems to be a poorly thought out agreement that didnt allow for it. The rest of the system is working perfectly.

t1_duwnp6c	1	*	And to be honest, most Canadians that get the chance to immigrate legally aren't going to be worrying about money lol.
t1_duwtwif	0	*	Your comment is a response to multiple US healthcare comments. And you were still off by quite a bit. Doctors account for $5B if Quebecs $36B budget.

t1_duaif2s	1	*	Sad.
t1_du974i2	0	*	it's the same old, same old.  circumcision has small value and small risk, but the religious fundamentalists really really want you to be circumcised.
t1_du96itr	0	*	People who have been circumcised due to religious family want it mandatory for everyone else. Its disgusting behavior. 
t1_du9aprf	0	*	Its not a requirement actually in islam that its a child. A muslim man just has to do it before he dies  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khitan_(circumcision)

t1_du9i3nf	0	*	Thank you for proving my point.   Not to mention your suspicion should be  the other way around. You should put more suspicion on a group that wants to sell you something for a profit.

t1_du9qsln	0	*	How many people get braces put into their children for non-medical reasons?
t1_du97k32	0	*	Serious harm would mean it physically impares you from doing something. Circumcision when done right(especially at a young age) causes no damage.
t1_du9qevk	1	*	Come on now, that's misleading. The guy who invented Corn Flakes and popularized the practice of circumcising boys to curtail masturbation was the _brother_ of the founder of Kellog's.
t1_du9kg9u	0	*	What about the fact that the piercings leave scars even if they close?  So is your distinction that the mutilation of kids with piercings are ok because they close up in time? 
t1_du9z54n	0	*	They'd be fine if they just knew what the question was in the first place.

t1_du9tubw	0	*	> And ears serve an important function.  Do they?  The out ear has almost no impact on hearing. You'd be perfectly fine with your ears chopped off.
t1_du9jnr3	1	*	Yes it looks like we did. 
t1_du9uveh	1	*	Nope - schizo's suffer from an illness; the troll you are wasting your time on, is simply a pervert by choice.
t1_dua2ll7	0	*	It functions, just not quite as well as an uncircumcised penis.  It has less sensitivity, and moves in and out of the vagina less freely.
t1_du98llk	0	*	True but there are plenty of babies who will be raised incorrectly, mistreated or even living void of any love. No one really tries to protect those kids if its within the law, unlike circumcision
t1_du9ko6i	0	*	~~Sounds lazy~~  EDIT: Sorry I said this

t1_du6zlpj	1	*	Wouldn't know, I never keep any car for more than 5 years. American car manufactures  used to think Japanese cars are crap until the Japanese destroyed them
t1_du73zab	0	*	You're right, that's why this whole crisis sound a little bit hypocritical to me.
t1_dud3n3g	1	*	In this case I would tend to agree that they seem to be inclined to think the two people in the indictments weren't colluding. Overall I wouldn't agree. 
t1_dud4acu	0	*	>Are you referring to speculative collusion with other Russian trolls/agents/operatives that might get nailed at a later date?  Yes, I don't think that has been ruled out at all.

t1_dsc2hct	1	*	ye so lets create a system or organization or law that has way too much power and can be easily corrupted to deal with the minor issue of having people say bad things?

t1_du9pjmn	1	*	Or the obvious fact that China is lying about their numbers. Their prisoners per capita are higher than the US and UK if we are to believe them.
t1_du97uvm	1	*	I guess as long as we are in fantasy land, we can say China has double the prisoners as America.

t1_duuysot	0	*	Can't fix stupid I guess  Why do you think Trump won? Russia? 
t1_dupkray	0	*	Hey, no worries. It happens. Although I'm not an absolute authority on audits (I just know enough to be dangerous) but a more specific term for what you are looking for might be a forensic audit. 
t1_dt9znoo	0	*	None of what I stated was opinion. Funny thing about liberals is when they try paint people as something its usually them thats guilty of it.
t1_dta14iz	1	*	https://youtu.be/zP4YDiv-Pjk Still wrong.
t1_dta1vxu	0	*	Text messages show one agent had a gut feeling that Trump was innocent.

t1_dt4r61x	0	*	Its ok. I'm pretty sure the debates were unavoidable haha
t1_dt4s6u6	0	*	Sane people murder?  I would think once you cross that line you're not really that sane.  
t1_dt4safa	0	*	Those laws didn't stop Adam Abdi from shooting people at random. It is all to do with culture and/or mental illness.
t1_dt4scnk	0	*	Columbine wasnt the first school shooting.  
t1_dt4tcyg	1	*	Yeah, weird.  
t1_dt4qo64	0	*	Sure bud!
t1_dtxuos6	0	*	It was to counter dumping. It wouldn't be so narrowly target otherwise.
t1_dtwsgj8	0	*	Yeah, Americans are shitty allies. You don't usually bully your friends and yet America under Trump is trying to do it at every turn.
t1_dtwkj1p	0	*	Go ahead and vote for someone willing to do it then. You'll hear little complaint from us.
t1_dtxp2uu	1	*	> But why run a positive story about the U.S. as your headline to the U.S./Canada section, when you can lede with something something Trump?  Seems a good question to ask of the BBC, eh wot?
t1_dtwksup	0	*	Uh... has the island moved?
t1_dtwkwa2	0	*	You really don't see the downsides to that for the US?
t1_dtwkgu5	0	*	> US  I think you meant to say the Soviet Union.
t1_dtx77bv	0	*	And risk losing the richest markets in the world? If they did try to choke the west with that I'm sure a certain rival country would gladly take over the title factory of the world
t1_dtx822s	0	*	Thankfully your country has some truly excellent systems of checks and balances and the EU moves slower than those systems.
t1_dtx5uvp	1	*	China wasn't found to not just sell at market rates, but to move production around to avoid tariffs.
t1_dtwscx9	0	*	How is it fair to put a tariff on products that you have no reason to put a tariff one? Unlike China, the EU isn't dumping their panels.
t1_dtwvcgu	1	*	Fitting username, mate.
t1_dtwogor	1	*	Some people have no idea. Nations are going to dominate each other. We either be on the winning side or the losing side.
t1_dtxeu8h	1	*	France still getting a lot of crap for kicking out US military bases after WWII, and we're creeping slowly but surely on a century anniversary.
t1_dtwle67	0	*	That was not yesterday. 
t1_dtf97h7	0	*	So not a single asylum seeker will face death in their home country? Even if they're LGBT and their country actively imprisons and executes them?
t1_ds598j2	0	*	> It sounds like you have trouble reconciling the fact that I support the President of the United States of America.  I'm assuming you supported Obama just as strongly? 
t1_dv5ye3z	1	*	OK. What were the specific things that came from Russian sources that fooled your friends into voting the way they did?
t1_dsbtpqa	0	*	and like I thought nothing to contribute. Btw why should libyan refugees travel to south africa across the entire continent when safe italy is a shorter distance away?
t1_dsbxyyv	1	*	Aside from the recently disposed government officials, NK, and the fact he left almost 20 years ago I agree.
t1_dsbrkwp	0	*	Off topic. Do you deny that colonialism hurt the economies of west africa?
t1_dsc5k3s	1	*	Read up on SK's history with US backed authoritarian regimes.
t1_dsbx2ow	0	*	The Indonesian one has a birth certificate that says that he is currently 21. He was born in 1994, but since his parents didn't pay the hospital the extra money they wanted he is legally 21.

t1_dsc2ss1	0	*	Ah insults when u have nothing. Btw it was common sense that eugenics were correct 100 years ago how did that end again? Dont claim anything without evidence. 
t1_dsbxxwd	0	*	So, not enough genocide?
t1_dsbtm7x	0	*	yep everyone from 1960-1970 has been dead for hundreds of years..... oh wait.   Alot of those people are still alive.
t1_dsczsdk	1	*	off topic.

t1_dsbudx7	0	*	> yet I've never seen any evidence of the entirety of Europe pouring into the US and other countries.  European refugees came by the millions to the Americas. 
t1_dsprrib	0	*	Wah, wah - they have it so bad,  they'll have to remind themselves how good they have it by ruining everything. Boo hoo, why can't we all be subsistence farmers? Fucking morons.
t1_dt1u9gi	0	*	Thats how you get a black market, folks   Edit: Jesus Christ you guys I know smoking is bad. I dont smoke but I understand that demand for it isnt going away any time soon. 
t1_dt1tnz5	0	*	That's how small business works. What should they have done?
t1_dt1ulx3	0	*	Should have put an /s on what I wrote.  
t1_dt1vhxu	0	*	Mostly after they're addicted and lose their free will. Hitmen are valued by their customers. Just because there's a market doesn't mean peddlers in said market deserve riches. 
t1_dt1rtrk	0	*	Are raw materials infinite?
t1_dt23dmf	0	*	There is a fundamental difference between varying wealth in a single country and countries with varying wealth. Countries like Czechia are not just endless bargain stores.
t1_dt3duov	0	*	I did make a mistake with loose instead of lose, you got me.   But the fact still reminds most investors lose money, that is well known fact, not quite sure what your argument is.
t1_dt24yvq	0	*	It didn't work in France either. 
t1_dt1sefa	1	*	All of your arguments are perfect. I enjoyed reading them 
t1_dt1viid	1	*	Wot.  Is this supposed to mean something.....
t1_dt1uw09	0	*	The most efficient businesses are the most successful. It's not some mystery.
t1_dt1rqpl	0	*	At any point in time it is finite or else you just collapsed the economy. Future projections are theoretically infinite but that's not mecessarily true either.
t1_dt1vujw	0	*	Not at all what i'm saying.
t1_dt1wj40	0	*	Hes not talking about people being poor, hes talking about people who have money they could invest making excuses not to.
t1_dt1xb26	1	*	No one's trolling someone had a counter point to what you said nothing wrong with that. If anything calling him a troll for disagreeing with you is trolling imo
t1_dt37j1f	1	*	Here, Mel Brooks did a pretty good job in History of the World, Part 1: [The people are revolting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0iAcQVIokg)
t1_dt1y3xs	0	*	It's not more unfair to be born to rich parents than to be born with an attractive face.  The world is inherently unfair (more in the sense it doesn't care fairness )
t1_dt29oey	0	*	Boo to you; what makes me sick is when people feel disdainful of those who can acquire things with ease. Why not strive for more? 
t1_dt1u8xf	0	*	No fucking way you have to be joking
t1_dt1tdqi	1	*	Yeah, if you bomb it, then you don't have to run!
t1_dt1t5db	0	*	So you're cool being 1000x more subjugated because your life is 1000x more convenient? Sounds like bootlicking to me
t1_dt1wk2z	0	*	Well you seem like an alright guy. We'll eat you last.
t1_dt2p0fp	1	*	For those who went from nothing to something through replicable steps, being poor does seem like a choice so to speak.
t1_dt1xp95	0	*	Because there are children retired and unemployed people in other countries so this reduces the number from seven billion. And would skew percentages.
t1_dt1y1xt	0	*	Correlation is not causation. 
t1_dt28wuw	1	*	Look at money bags over here commuting from Vallejo. The real poor people endure a 3-4 hour commute from the central valley.
t1_dt1s5vs	1	*	How many billionaires are there? Is the proportion of generous billionaires enough to offset the growing income inequality because of the way things are setup? No? Well, it's not enough.
t1_dt6qpu5	0	*	>He said he started in 2001, 16-17 years ago. He looks like hes in his early 30's. My estimate of him being a kid isnt far off  
t1_dt1z6ag	0	*	My confusion is that you're assuming the ratio is remaining the same, and I'm not seeing why that's a given. 
t1_dt1tzkd	1	*	Wealth is measured, I was using a simple measure for a basic example. I wasn't talking cash.
t1_dt2942x	0	*	Because you are calling your own group out without leaving it. 
t1_dt28e5a	1	*	So because you have seen both sides, are you kind of repulsed around people who were born into wealth? From what I can tell most of them are pretty terrible human beings.
t1_dt1xaa1	0	*	Im sorry but I have to ask, how did you become so successful?

t1_dt22hlu	0	*	Whatever. Just stop worrying about it and trying to change it. You cant anyway 
t1_dt1uvrr	1	*	Not really, people who quit smoking dont find that they have more money tucked away. They find that they just spend the money on other things. 
t1_dt1qbjj	0	*	I dont think you understand how money works... or are you saying that Bezo has some kind of a money-making machine?
t1_dt1sq2p	1	*	Just  Over  Broke

t1_dt1sgfv	0	*	What does an investor offer enough to reap a benefit from except capital.
t1_dt1ry93	0	*	They need a scapegoat. They'll figure it out eventually or end up dying in flames when they're on the losing side.
t1_dt23g8c	1	*	> Yet healthcare is hundreds of dollars a month   wrong! on average, healtcare is $1 thousand dollars per person  per month. That congressman was awfully stupid and naive with that comment.
t1_dt2win5	1	*	Yep, it's become more and more the case. We are entering very interesting times.
t1_dt1ssk5	0	*	I'm interested to see a source on this
t1_dt1x0bg	0	*	Any investment advice? Recently got $10,000 from my grandparents, keep being told to not do a Roth IRA and be a bit more bold instead. 
t1_dt1tvx7	0	*	No, there are 3485 inherited billionaires out of ~4168. I looked up the math on it, you just made up numbers.
t1_dt2oc44	0	*	I was in intensive care for like 4 months. That's why.

t1_dt31v8g	1	*	Well, they are (the vast majority of theft is wage theft), but that wasn't the point I was making.
t1_dt1st0j	0	*	You're right, but hedge fund stocks or property aren't exactly 'risky' either
t1_dt25vxw	1	*	Howd you get that rich and how long did it take. Would like to know your story since youve said you were on both sides.
t1_dt1ztjs	1	*	I went to China just before the Olympics there. The view from my 5 star high rise hotel suite was slums as far as I could see. It felt really odd
t1_dt2bb8h	1	*	> And i'm pretty sure the purcentage of people being owners is in fact declining.  No doubt, especially with Gen X and Millennials heavily embracing the newly burgeoning sharing economy. 
t1_dt1ufu9	0	*	But then I don't get to die young
t1_dt1ujxn	0	*	You're ok with 45% of the population not being able to retire?....
t1_dt1ocot	0	*	It could be an interesting book, but my understanding of the term identity politics is that it's just code for a social issue that I want to dismiss because I don't think it's important. 
t1_dt1vgkz	1	*	I support legalizing them as well but it doesn't mean you're not a shitbag for selling them. Selling something that literally kills people is immoral. 
t1_dt1wd73	1	*	Yep
t1_dt20rej	1	*	Ha my thoughts exactly :D I want a warm cuddly utopia :D
t1_dt26h9s	1	*	I guess we have slightly different perspectives on this.
t1_dt2n20l	1	*	Yes, that's what I mean. To get a 2 bedroom house for $400k, you have to go 50 miles outside the city or troll foreclosure listings.
t1_dt26b0q	1	*	That sounds like the pattern I've seen over the years. Most people get rich by, eventually, getting into investments.
t1_dt1uos2	0	*	Working in a sweatshop is a dramatic improvement from working in rural China or India.
t1_dt2dm7e	0	*	Most countries in Africa then. Happy?
t1_dt1tvsi	0	*	A lot of people can't afford it.  If you don't get started asap, you get left behind.
t1_dt1rq1b	1	*	Very true, although typically not solely - Lyft, for example, attracted a number of investment groups, Andreessen Horowitz being the most notable, well before Carl Icahn got involved.
t1_dt2lo6v	0	*	Because they are lazy. People hate [googling easily verifiable facts](http://www.politifact.com/global-news/statements/2016/nov/09/john-kerry/yep-most-people-clueless-us-foreign-aid-spending/).

t1_dt1wxip	0	*	Obama was a normal ass dude for most of his life. 
t1_dt1u8r3	0	*	If a stock gain is unrealized, should they be taxed though? Do you have stocks? Would you like to be taxed before you actually cash out on your stock?

t1_dt1ywbw	0	*	Bill Gates was born into wealth but he didn't inherit billions. That you chose to go with the number of people who inherited literal billions shows that you're being dishonest.

t1_dt1ug2n	0	*	Yeah, that's the caste system at work. Pretty fucked up. 
t1_dt1vdnp	0	*	That wasn't really the answer to to my question but I'll take it and ask, is it possible to deserve hunger and homelessness?

t1_dsk8x3o	0	*	Oh, so standard bullshit.  I thought they might matter  
t1_dsk8rtw	0	*	I do too. But when I get home I'm happy that I helped society. I don't despise all the non-white poor people I just helped out.

t1_dslk9es	0	*	Yeah, and that's why it's dumb as fuck to use literacy as your argument. That's why I posted the comparison.

t1_dugok3q	0	*	She's going to a prison in Iraq filled with other extremists and then gets out while she's still young. I'm sure she'll keep up her radical bullshit, instead of going on to live a normal western life.
t1_duinbqh	1	*	sounds about right.
t1_duhpr0t	0	*	Man that's awful. I never did find out the sentence for those two, I wasn't there for that part of the trial, but I can't imagine they got off lightly.

t1_duhjzyz	1	*	That depends on how she'll spend her 6 years in prison.  And I don't think Germany would just take her back. I hope there will be a second trial for her when she comes back.
t1_duhnva7	1	*	You know, except for the part where I didn't.

t1_dsiturv	0	*	Because it is a global system. That is the whole point cryptocurrency fanboys come up with: cryptos are decentralized, uncontrolled, global currencies.
t1_dsixv9h	0	*	I feel bad for the people you've helped scam out of money. 
t1_dsj4ro6	1	*	True, it would probably be better received if the discourse wasn't dominated by nerds.
t1_dsieo93	0	*	People exchanging money is literally happening. Your claim that it is untrustworthy hasn't prevented people from choosing to transact using this system and doing so in very large numbers. 
t1_dsijqf7	1	*	Everything technically can be used as currency. Money is just far more convenient than buying stuff with camels and goats.
t1_dsiybex	1	*	I like it. Thanks for the heads up. 
t1_dsitv5m	0	*	Deflation (price increase) and bubble pop (price decree) is literally two opposite things. Make up your mind. 
t1_dsigihh	1	*	Read all that posters btc comments, clearly has no idea what they have bought into.  That said, maybe I should buy some stuff off him using BTC.
t1_dsj8w0b	0	*	Well yeah I can imagine it's hard since you're wrong and don't know the definition of a bubble.   I guess the euro is a bubble
t1_duj4k7s	0	*	A bit of whataboutism but you should read about American foreign policy in the middle east.  Plus if he swallowed polonium openly, that's an open and shut case of suicide.
t1_duj5rwn	0	*	That was US.
t1_dujg5wx	1	*	Hence they don't care, or are in fear of repercussions since about any opposition usually ends up dead.
t1_duj379h	1	*	You're welcome.
t1_duj2cdh	1	*	We should probably start with the US who has been meddling in every election since WW2.

t1_duj0mfs	0	*	Do people actually use _commie_ unironically?
t1_duj3ssb	0	*	How does that make sense? Being gay isn't *normal*. Literally. It's not the norm. There's nothing wrong with it, but it isn't normal by the very definition of the word.

t1_duj2yvh	0	*	Its not often you hear straight people droning on about their sexuality, when gay people on the other hand pretty much act as if being gay is their major identifying trait, like its a party trick
t1_dukl3t9	0	*	I disagree. When they said that homosexuals deserve to die or wasn't because they were brainwashed, it is just who they are and now they empowered so they say what they really think.

t1_duj2mlm	0	*	Yeah I think Laura Ingraham is still salty that Lebron said something political.

t1_dujbj5u	0	*	In theory does that mean anyone can get around wearing a helmet on a motorcycle if they wear a turban and claim to be a Sikh?
t1_dujhe7r	0	*	As far as Russians are concerned they probably think this is as good as it gets considering their previous dictators.
t1_dujdhby	0	*	Isn't this the fundamental issue with democracy? People are idiots.

t1_duj1wug	1	*	I hope you at least are having fun, cause you sure aren't saying anything worth anyone else's time.
t1_duj8ka2	1	*	It's the same thing with people who think gay is a choice. Most of them are just suppressing their homosexual desires.  Poor fellas live a horrible life of Insecurity and identity crisis.

t1_dujhwbl	1	*	I think you are using that wrong...
t1_duj0h10	0	*	Wow. Downplay, distract with whataboutism, then bring up an irrelevant but somehow justified statement only tangentially related to the conversation.  Russian confirmed.
t1_duj3kzt	0	*	Congratulations!  You understood a stupid joke!  We're all so very proud of you!
t1_duj0xyj	0	*	After reading your comments, it sounds like we'd remove a good deal of the hatred in this thread if we IP blocked *you*

t1_dujlo52	1	*	Well, at this point, since it is so well know, running against Putin could be considered Suicide...
t1_duk6pxe	1	*	Ditto. It does no good to engage in the same acts of deliberate misinformation and mudslinging as the homophobes. 
t1_duj3bwl	1	*	The US is among a select few countries in the world where that doesnt happen. If you try to bribe a cop youll end up in jail.

t1_dujnbey	1	*	Most of us can't believe it either, tbh
t1_duj8o6n	1	*	It's not, he's referring directly to Kremlin propaganda..makes sense that they fed Russians the same stuff they fed gullible Americans (Hillary is going to start a war with Russia)

t1_dsvjdc6	0	*	I disagree because the US unemployment rate is at the lowest it has been for a decade. So nope there isn't enough workers if you remove all immigrants.

t1_dsuvth6	0	*	Sweet ad hominem attack bro
t1_dsv0dgm	0	*	Nope, but thanks for playing. (See how this works yet?)
t1_dsur6dn	1	*	Same with the weinstein scandal.  Once one person came out, many others followed suit.  And some people knew about that stuff a long long time ago.
t1_dsytu5s	1	*	Super troll
t1_dsuwjif	0	*	The US is not extremely relaxed on its immigration policy at all. It's notoriously hard to get into the country and even that much harder to get permission to stay.  
t1_dsuxi0u	0	*	If Americans are too lazy to do the jobs, why *shouldn't* we bring in people willing to do them?
t1_dsuy6li	0	*	Norwegians are often better educated than Americans too.
t1_dsut7ze	1	*	Don't forget the morons that *didn't* vote for Trump...or anyone at all.

t1_dsvp0v1	1	*	With fewer than 100 per year using that visa, that cost was largely non-existent. 
t1_dsutpvp	1	*	Oops. I don't normally misspell things that badly. They're fixed now.
t1_dsuuife	1	*	Im not confident theres *no* politician out there that lies more than him, but he is shockingly bad at covering his tracks. Its just *so* obvious hes full of shit to anyone outside his base.
t1_dsvkiso	0	*	So, no one did.
t1_dsutf2z	0	*	The visas were temporary.  Temporary is now over.  That's what temporary means.
t1_dsusdw4	0	*	Anything to support your claim? 
t1_dsv4dcv	1	*	He was the outside candidate, with no political experience other than bribing politicians. When you want a CEO for your company you want someone with no proven track record in that spot right?
t1_dsuth91	0	*	Sorry, I should have been more specific.  These Haitians are extremely small fish.  The bigger issue is stopping the agricultural industry from using illegal labor, regardless of country of origin.
t1_dsvk8re	1	*	Yall are racist as fuck.  I been on lots of planes and never once have I thought Boy I hope I dont have to use this mask cuz everyone but me SMELLS BAD  
t1_dsurz1j	0	*	and what's stopping the employer from sending an anonymous tip to ICE if someone blows the whistle?
t1_dsw8j0l	0	*	Yeah shithole seems like an objective term that can be factually correct... Just like retard and bigot.
t1_dsv2e4e	1	*	I'm guessing the official line is ab-a-dee-ab-a-die
t1_dsv4nkc	0	*	90% of cab drivers are Hatians here and they all drive like fucking assholes. Even compared to the typical Miami driver and that's saying something
t1_dsus7ay	1	*	The middle class is shrinking because they're becoming part of the upper class. The upper-middle and upper classes are growing, while the lower class and lower-middle classes are shrinking.

t1_dsuwbaw	0	*	$$$$
t1_dsvqdl8	1	*	Those countries aren't comparable to the US in terms of economics. Unless you think what would work in califronia would work in alabama. 
t1_dsutt15	0	*	The 30% of the USA that are his hardcore supporters don't care what he does, so why appease them?  He is alienating 70% of America. That's stupid politics.
t1_dsv4da8	1	*	Yeah Americans are almost blatantly brainwashed it seems.
t1_dsxef3z	0	*	Now imagine being a US worker who gets a job that wouldn't have existed except thanks to the economic growth from those immigrants
t1_dsvgsep	1	*	Do you honestly think buisnesses are bad because they lay people off? Thats just life. If you are that big a company, you have to restructure sometimes  
t1_dsuxiv4	0	*	Because the words in those two sentences are not the same?
t1_dsuvd2s	0	*	To each his own.
t1_dsv97fq	1	*	Nope.  Even undocumented immigrants.  They are not eligible for welfare programs, but still pay certain taxes and buy a lot of goods.
t1_dsuwmvw	0	*	Just because Obamacare wasnt perfect doesnt mean it wasnt wayyy better than what we had before
t1_dsusocq	0	*	You arent getting your counters point... its about perspective and all you arent taking the second to take a step back from hating Trump to realize this still effects people...

t1_dsuyz3z	0	*	Americans don't have to pay America taxes if they did not reside in the U.S. for more than a month I believe.
t1_dsur0vx	1	*	They love anything that blames their problems on minorities and lies about bringing their jobs back. 
t1_dsuvtxc	1	*	Only dumbasses believe that. Why build a wall when they'll fly over it?
t1_dswn1ml	0	*	So youve never said anything disrespectful of another country before? Look at any post of Reddit talking about Brazil. And he called the country a shit hole he didnt call the citizens shitheads.
t1_dsuvwmj	0	*	Minimum wage was $4.25 and I made $7.15 an hour. Hardly slave wages at the time.
t1_dsut03w	0	*	My 401k, bank account, and childrens' future says otherwise. It's going to be a *great* 7 years.
t1_dsvgq88	0	*	You got duped into thinking that list has anything to do with shitholes. You're so good at bringing these comments right back to your talking point. 
t1_dsuxmxa	0	*	Im sure you know several trump supporters being a the_donald troll.
t1_dsx61wd	1	*	Ok. I hear you.
t1_dsuqcex	0	*	whats wrong with advertising an existing visa program? every country in the world has these types of programs.
t1_dsuta6y	1	*	The Patriot act was supposed to be temporary too. No reason this couldn't continue too.
t1_dsusk3y	0	*	The U.S.A. already has at least one of those down.
t1_dsux87j	1	*	So it's...   #*low energy*? 
t1_dsv946t	0	*	> Then where do you draw the line?  This isn't about me. This is about calling other countries shitholes.
t1_dsvcbq3	0	*	Nope. I-20 is for F-1 visas and DS-2019 is for J-1. Those are both different from an I94. 
t1_dsutgb6	0	*	heartless
t1_dsuzimn	1	*	I was there in 2005 after the coup, sorry not a revolution, a coup. 
t1_dsw26ga	0	*	Or put another way, 63.4% of all construction jobs are held by white people, even though apparently white people refuse to do those jobs, or something.
t1_dsuyqhw	0	*	> The number is typically around 100 per year  are you one of them? Wow, you don't even meet that low bar. Racist!
t1_dsvona5	0	*	I know, outrage and ignorance couldn't have much to do with it
t1_dswjtvd	0	*	450,000 people per year isn't a lot?  So after ten years, of they still don't leave, that's 4.5million.   That's not a lot? You cray.
t1_dsv52w1	0	*	Culturally south florida is a really unique place.
t1_dsurnni	1	*	Oh what the fuck, apparently that's only for tipped workers now. Used to be that the tip worker wage was the agriculture wage. Didn't know that that wage wasn't even the min for AG workers lol
t1_dsurh9v	0	*	Probably used for war and politics and just general communication, too. Just like all languages. 
t1_dsuud7b	1	*	And cactus disguises.
t1_dsvdfn9	1	*	Same way communism is way more socially acceptable then fascism. 
t1_dsvd9wv	1	*	Didn't his base shrink though? His approval ratings gone down in his own base hasn't it?
t1_dsvbof9	0	*	Well, they are Democrat so.......
t1_dsv9zn7	1	*	What if there was a temp worker company (or union) and a federal program to subsidize the wages of American citizen migrant farm workers?  We already subsidize crops.  
t1_dsussmh	0	*	Right, this is another important distinction to make. Trump is not cutting out a program that was providing a path to citizenship, just one that provided visas to work.
t1_dsv8y1e	0	*	It takes anyone with common sense to see that.  Obama was gaping pussy apologist
t1_dsv9lna	0	*	So there's more illegals than natives in the country? 
t1_dsv3diz	0	*	I'm afraid I just blue myself  Oh, and Trump and the GOP are racist shits, time to clean the shithouse...midterms, here we come...
t1_dsv8z5s	1	*	There's nothing to clarify, the story is told very well by the republican party itself. 
t1_dsv5p45	0	*	We found the Trumpite.
t1_dsuv62c	1	*	Yes I dont like that either.
t1_dsuy10j	1	*	so.... is Haiti a shithole?
t1_dsuvc1p	1	*	Well its easily fixable if you let them earn opportunities, if you let them DREAM or something...
t1_dsuvwl3	1	*	That's rough.
t1_dsve7hp	0	*	What are the 3 other countries? 
t1_dswastu	0	*	Do you mean green onions or french's fried onions?  I would think that cooking the latter would kill off any nasties.
t1_dsuzsf9	0	*	I love swearing. I really do. I just don't like pompous racists.
t1_dsuzsir	0	*	But it wasn't ANY OTHER REPUBLICAN, it was Trump. And in case you forgot the RNC was almost entirely against Trump right up until the minute he won. 
t1_duitd57	0	*	I underestimate how many facts you pull out of your ass.
t1_duihuc8	0	*	Executing people in the streets without due process is not moral in any society, nor is that subjective. 
t1_duiybgb	0	*	Can't provide any, unfortunately. Like I said, this is all anecdotes I've heard from talking to a shitload of leasing / property managers over the past year or so.  
t1_dt632bv	1	*	> They didnt, because people didnt have a hate boner for Obama    Holy fucking deluded. Obama was hated from day 1, just not by the same people. 
t1_dt5wfs1	0	*	I'm sure you can see the difference between taking your hat off and refusing women access.
t1_dt6iw5z	1	*	Thanks for the detailed response, I appreciate it!
t1_dt6z8wk	1	*	The only reason its still on the books is because its easier to ignore it than to repeal it.
t1_dt65rmf	0	*	They advertise it as such.  Center for all the monotheistic religions etc.
t1_dt6wix4	0	*	The site in question isn't even in Israel.

t1_dsw56cj	1	*	then dont follow americas lead  I dont think russia should be sanctioned anyway
t1_dsvcd0a	0	*	I wouldn't care. polls don't concern me nor is anything going to change. 
t1_dsv6njb	0	*	Has Trump put a stop to this or is he continuing at a greater pace?  MOABs again?
t1_dsv1zza	0	*	Huge amount of people living in poverty, barely educated, in giant metropolitan areas and the huge amount of illegal aliens and victims from the drug war put that figure into perspective 
t1_dsvpf5t	1	*	You know that THAT HAS NO BEARING ON THIS SURVEY, right?
t1_dsw7omg	1	*	Cunning, cunning, cunning.

t1_dsvdos3	0	*	Sources?
t1_dswsthw	1	*	> you can be sure they are Americans.  Nah. PRC Chinese have taken that dubious title. Not Taiwanese, not Chinese from Singapore, or frankly anywhere else, just mainland China. 
t1_dsv4nlm	1	*	Fucking what?  
t1_dsvb8bt	1	*	I didn't say that. The post I replied to was complaining how hard it was to be a jew and not having anything like racism to blame for his hardships. Don't use racism or anti-semitism as an excuse.
t1_dsw90eq	1	*	You really wanna know?  Petrodollar.  Oil is traded in dollars and only dollars.  USD.  That's what it was all about.
t1_dsvr9bv	1	*	I wish you guys wouldnt do this as it gives people a false impression of Canadians.
t1_dsv4sd1	0	*	Is this your best defence tactic for lies that you would like to be true?
t1_dsv8gri	1	*	Also the unprecedented levels of surveillance that Obama authorised
t1_dsvxp9u	0	*	> every year I donate money to the IRA.  Are you suggesting donating money to Israel is the same as donating it to the IRA?
t1_dsv5dhy	0	*	Ah, yes, all the economists are just lying to us!
t1_dsvrr60	0	*	>Someone wrote a book, so it must be true??  Nope everything is a lie! If you don't like the information, it's fake news.
t1_dswfmpg	1	*	That said that there were some very fine neonazis around?
t1_dsvgxwz	0	*	well he was massacring his own people for starters. The entire Libyan civil war kicked off with the Libyan army machine gunning protestors in Tripoli. 
t1_dswmw92	1	*	This is laughable. As a future multi millionaire I can tell you Trump is making economy better than ever in history
t1_dsvihui	1	*	He takes everything literally except for whenever Trump says something, those are always jokes or metaphors and fragile librulz take him too seriously
t1_dswry4t	0	*	In the context of Trump has MAGA'd because the stock market is up, it's meaningless. It is a massive gain for the top 1 to .01%, but for everyone else, it's not a meaningful metric.
t1_dsvfre5	0	*	Note that they weren't world wars til you got involved. Before then they were just friendly banter between neighbours. 
t1_dswvuo0	0	*	Enjoy your fantasy 
t1_dsvonbx	0	*	Yes. When our words convince others to act in hate maybe we can actually...hmm control the narrative and say ' fuck Netanyahu' instead of labelling the whole country as complicit in crimes
t1_dsv6ydf	0	*	No, not really. We vote for the electoral and the electoral votes for the president. It really is a republic even if there are similarities. I'm not presenting a cop out as I like Trump.
t1_dsvailo	1	*	And here i was thinking Islam was a country.
t1_dsv6pp6	0	*	So is like, the vast majority of any western leader by that standard, considering how they all went along with it. 
t1_dsv0chv	0	*	> The fact that no one has said it  Plz cite.  
t1_dsv5p6e	0	*	> Basicly any democratic country in the world is a republic.  Eh not exactly.  Source: I'm Australian which is a democracy but also a monarchy. 
t1_dsw17si	1	*	Israel needs to learn that the proper way of shutting down criticism is to scream racism and sexism, like we do here in America. 
t1_dsv21kp	0	*	Then you've been observing a very different media than I have, which reports directly on what he says and does rather than 'parroting the American media' without fact checking them.
t1_dswfnzk	1	*	Because they don't respect you enough to not have a conversation surrounding fuck your religion around you?
t1_dsvfquy	0	*	Holy fuck you're crazy. They're were klansmen too. Guess you'll defend them ?

t1_dsvpb28	1	*	Way to miss every point.  America's global reputation already accounted for everything you bring up, (because how could it not?) Trump made it drop lower.
t1_dsx35w3	1	*	Including their new PM!
t1_dty85sg	1	*	Except, the person above you didn't say they didn't trust the Justice Department at all.  They were talking about the FBI, you are the one who brought up the Justice Department.  
t1_dspifix	0	*	Are you actually getting pissy over a war that happened in 1687.
t1_dskfxme	0	*	I'd probably remember if my boss called another company's people living in huts or everyone has aids.
t1_dskh6jf	0	*	He didn't just say Haiti was a shit hole.   He said why do we need more people from Haiti. ie implying that if your from a shit hole country that makes you a shit hole person.
t1_dskzaea	0	*	And if Trump said the country is a shithole, give us your poor and unwanted and we will take them in people wouldn't be calling him racist. 
t1_dskognb	1	*	Oh my bad, misread your comment. Thought you were talking about the current migrants TO European countries
t1_dslcyfg	0	*	I'm not sure you understand what an opinion piece is (hint: they go in the Opinions section, not the US News section)
t1_dskfx4t	0	*	Vox has a very in depth summary if you look up Trump Racism Summary. The incident from 1991 is particularity damning as it shows just how long he has been openly racist.
t1_dskzxkc	1	*	Then we agree ;)  Good evening.
t1_dskkdqw	1	*	It's not about reporting news...or the well being of the country. It's about getting that ad revenue.
t1_dsl8vao	0	*	I'd call it a developing nation.  If I was an uncouth asshole with no tact, I might call it a shit hole.  
t1_dsn5hy6	0	*	No, thats like you saying something to your friends about the fat girl and they go and tell her what you said 
t1_dsky1bg	0	*	Hopefully the rest of the world is patient then, because they'll have to deal with diplomatic mishaps almost weekly at this point.
t1_dsk55li	0	*	They were still using swords before McArthur came. Then they went all out militaristic authoritarian and focuses solely on war. So surpressing rights and going pure authoritarian was what it took. 
t1_dsl5h7d	0	*	Yes... but the fact that they're a junior party member *and yhe fact that she's the immigration minister* kinda makes you think.
t1_dsko62h	1	*	Thats a pretty low bar.
t1_dskufq3	0	*	That's entirely beside the point.
t1_dskyut5	1	*	Life isn't meant to be fair. We are needing less and less unqualified labor as time goes by btw.
t1_dss03c7	0	*	You called the people of Haiti excrement.. You're ignoring what the country has been through. 
t1_dskdo15	1	*	Although, is Also entirely accurate that Haiti is a shit-hole /trump-hater
t1_dskihh1	1	*	I don't know how it's unreasonable to think 50 times less wealth isn't a good thing?  Thinking it's good would be unreasonable to me.
t1_dsl42qs	0	*	So humans have a different quality level based on origin location?  How do you check that? Inspect their hooves?
t1_dskj2wq	0	*	The Chinese killing 40 million of their own to play catch up was a healthy and good choice? I honk you might just be a racist idiot.
t1_dskocl2	0	*	So you care because of identity politics?
t1_dskygwn	0	*	Then why did he immediately suggest other immigrants were superior if the shithole comment didnt have anything to do with people?
t1_dskkni0	1	*	Just as we thought, a hidden oil derrick. And the snow beast was a mechanical monster!
t1_dsknkyu	0	*	Arguably, acceptance and compassion are human values shared by most nations. There is nothing specifically American about them.

t1_dskhh7s	1	*	You don't build a culture in 200 years. All of those places had an intact culture to start from.... That's like a 1000 year head start.

t1_du168g7	0	*	Dude, that journal has 0.27 Impact Factor. They would take in anything. This means this article was rejected by more serious journals. Take anything in it with a grain of salt.
t1_du11egy	0	*	Its a very strong effect  By what metric? Placebo only works where psychological trickery works. You cant placebo your way out of cancer. 
t1_du0vrhz	0	*	And Rainbow of course
t1_du19qxu	0	*	People who are not critical about new ideas that don't make sense certainly are idiots. The human condition should make you question things. Not blindly believe them without supporting evidence.

t1_du11nz5	0	*	It only works if you stir it up and bang it around in a very precise manner. It takes a diploma at least to get it right. The poop just gets sloshed around which is not the same.

t1_dsxh8aw	1	*	Israel 2.0 situation. Sounds great.
t1_dsxdnnn	1	*	>Assuming I'm republican  The absolute state of children these days.  You're the one that identifies as conservative.
t1_dt3pn5o	1	*	That'd be a massive simplification but yeah, kind of.
t1_dsxksp9	0	*	What do you mean didn't do anything? Germany was seriously frowned upon by the Brits.
t1_dsxdlik	0	*	lol This is your argument? Humanity is getting smarter and its because the allies won WWII. 
t1_dsxu3s4	0	*	> allowing only civilians to flee the fighting.  But how did they know who is civilian and YPG?  
t1_dsymnan	1	*	If they can make it happen without turning into a failed state, and most of the residents of the area agree, yes.
t1_dsxa6qh	0	*	> on marxist ideas   Yeah please give us examples. Antifa wasnt a marxist idea, the first Antifascist groups came about 3-4 decades after Marx died.
t1_dsxh7cu	0	*	Well it was a bit different no?
t1_dsxc2do	0	*	Arguably preferable to being split up between several different countries.
t1_dsxdibv	0	*	Charter*
t1_dsxcr32	0	*	They aren't even state capitalist. Most of the property in the country is under private ownership, they're essentially a Social Democracy using radical rhetoric.
t1_dsxr1dk	1	*	Nope, it's just AoE1. The monk conversion sound in AoE2 was [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oTUvjgvVWE&t=2m25s).
t1_dsxa30m	0	*	Ocalan is Bookchin advocate.
t1_dsymzqe	1	*	sadly that doesn't change a FACT.
t1_dsxzqrw	1	*	Yeah, yeah, let's just forget that ~500 000 greeks were killed in that population exchange. I know that in modern Turkey it's called like that, nothing new here.
t1_dsxca5e	1	*	Scroll up a little bit. Anyway this does not correlate at all with the Kurds.
t1_dsy0xj2	0	*	Buh-but that's not *real* socialism!
t1_dsxy3ad	1	*	he can't, because Magnitsky was fucking assassinated which pretty much cemented the proof of the claims.
t1_dsy084c	0	*	This dude wished more mass shootings on an entire country. He's already at their level. 
t1_dsx6bfe	1	*	I don't know. I am not an arab
t1_dsxmj4b	0	*	Source?
t1_dsxki62	1	*	I dont think so either. This bill should recieve 100% yes votes from both sides though. This is good for everyone. Its nothing thats really a partisan issue. 
t1_dsxcki5	0	*	Britain didn't stop fighting after France fell though.
t1_dsxxhtp	0	*	...The same people that made up part of the mujaheddin went and splintered off into Al Quaeda.   Stop being a pedantic fucking ass.
t1_dsxas4n	1	*	That is not what he said, haha.
t1_dsyaoc0	1	*	Is there a solution to this or do we just sort of hope it corrects itself kind of like the middle ages in Europe
t1_dsyiqpi	0	*	Turkey starting their own anti missle project and Turkey developing a functioning anti missile system are two different things. 
t1_dsx5ral	1	*	You're awesome for posting this, thank you.
t1_dsxesju	0	*	It was on the Russian side of Germany. Not much the allied nations could do short of marching through Germany.
t1_dsxhu1g	0	*	> Oh, and again: The culture of Caralonia was never in danger.  except under franko after war which mind you it was very very very recently.
t1_dsxthdn	0	*	This emirates you call are at most  tribes. As far as i know kurds never got a state of their own and im sure they didnt have one after 1071 where turks started to settle in anatolia
t1_dsxjkzz	0	*	>when a whole ethnic group commits treason, what is your option  That feel when you fully support genocide but know enough to sugar coat your opinion with i am not saying they deserved it...
t1_dsxma1f	0	*	You've explained nothing.
t1_dsx8gy0	1	*	ok...
t1_dsxr8xe	1	*	Of course not, the US would overthrow them before the Russians got their support
t1_dsxkt7j	1	*	nug4t, the supreme secret strategist. Go let the YPG know that you are such a master tactician, I'm sure they'll appreciate your help! 
t1_dsyn1sh	1	*	If anything that history is evidence that we will. Because the historic trend is ever *decreasing* rates of violence and war over time. 
t1_dsxm76z	0	*	yes almost like us and sdf right..  http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/resources/idt-sh/raqqas_dirty_secret  sell your outdated bullshit to someone else
t1_dsxhu25	0	*	Is that the same as how the Romans didn't have a state when their empire encompassed hundreds of cities that weren't Rome?
t1_dsxh28u	0	*	Well hopefully just two.
t1_dsx937j	0	*	Hmm. Do you mean they are also related with tak? http://www.wikizero.info/index.php?q=aHR0cHM6Ly9lbi53aWtpcGVkaWEub3JnL3dpa2kvS3VyZGlzdGFuX0ZyZWVkb21fSGF3a3M
t1_dtkwwzt	1	*	You should have a chat with our founders if you believe promote the general welfare is too vague.
t1_dtkk289	1	*	I have given you a more weighted argument in another response to a different post
t1_dtkpt5y	1	*	Are you fucking kidding me? The UK is a single payer system and has the same, if not higher, obesity rate as the USA.

t1_dsgn8tu	0	*	I don't give a fuck about the stigma of people with Aids, I don't want some random jackass giving me HIV because it's not a death sentence.
t1_dsh23d9	1	*	Aww but Aussies are usually such cool cunts.
t1_dsguqzy	0	*	> Without really knowing much about Churchill or what you're specifically referring to I can still confidently say: No, no he did not.  He did. If you dont know why, dont bother to post.
t1_dsgohvo	1	*	can we say goodbye to you from posting? fuck i hope so
t1_dsgr34e	1	*	This. Skipping trials is a slippery slope. 
t1_dsh761t	1	*	Oh I apologize, just replace what I said with HIV.
t1_dsi53zp	1	*	Now this guy get it.
t1_dsgru42	1	*	Other STDs have a higher mortality rate? We should ban them too.
t1_dsgxl5p	0	*	Which ones? I've seen some angry minorities but never anything like the conservative fable of the SJW.
t1_dsgxasj	1	*	Please do. We need more insults in the lexicon.
t1_dsgnpuz	0	*	No longer a death sentence? Ohhh I guess that's okay then. AIDS me up, motherfucker.
t1_dsiglik	0	*	Would you call whites staying in America British - Americans? 
t1_dsip0r0	0	*	You're one hell of a hypocrite for talking about tolerance when one of your most recent comments is Maybe they should just get rid of the Muslims?   In short, suck mah dick, scum.
t1_dsipbgb	1	*	When they shit on people because they are a  completely shit person it's warranted. 
t1_dsiis4h	0	*	> Gypsies adopt the customs and language of their host countries  They most certainly do not, at least not most of them. They have their own customs and distinct language. 
t1_dsim3s5	1	*	Ah jeez. Now I'm really ashamed. So many good one liners from Zoolander. Time to put that one on my watch list again.
t1_dsihyro	0	*	1. All parliament laws require royal assent 2. Armed forces pledge allegience to the king/queen who can command them directly 3. Queen is sovereign, ie cannot be arrested.
t1_dssj25b	0	*	Shit Africas been doing it for decades...just for diamonds not even religion.  Actually it dosent matter over what,both children soldiers 
t1_dssiwvg	0	*	My toddler cries if I turn off Mickey Mouse.  I cant even fathom this.
t1_dssifkm	0	*	Heya, Evangelical here. I've been hearing about the bad rep we get Stateside (based in Asia at the moment)  what do you think causes this?  Edit: a word
t1_dssirkq	0	*	No. Don't try to justify it with some moral high ground bullshit. You want to watch it for morbid curiosity. There's no valid greater good argument here.
t1_dssjgbb	1	*	That's still parsecs away from everyone thinking that they're the best.  Simply put, some people thinking that they're great at some things =/= everybody thinking they're the best at everything.
t1_dssizk8	0	*	Just be glad you didn't watch the video of cartel members dismembering some bloke while he was alive
t1_dssz94c	0	*	Out of curiosity, is a cell phone detonator not considered armed?
t1_dssiij7	0	*	The general message of the *New Testament* is peace. The Old Testament is basically fire, brimstone, smiting, and fear me, for I am God on any page you turn to.
t1_dsskiz8	0	*	I think he meant the lay person reading this story, not the victims.
t1_dssm1u9	1	*	I saw dashcam footage where a brick went through a windshield and right into the passenger's head. Nothing graphic, but the screaming of everyone in the car was unreal. 
t1_dssnxhe	1	*	You monster.
t1_dst4gqr	1	*	Just goes to show that there's actual big money and players like turkey or the saudis supporting them.
t1_dssjnlg	0	*	I will never unremember Daniel Pearl. It seemed so beyond the scope of reality back then.
t1_dssigb3	0	*	When I hear the the Old Testament doesnt count anymore, I ask so the 10 commandments are no longer valid?. Its usually met with insults.
t1_dssmswp	0	*	well, much of Aleppo is like that still.  massive destruction was mostly on the frontlines that split the city into east & west. though sadly the old city got nailed really hard.
t1_dsszkg2	0	*	Throw in USA dropping nukes on two Japanese cities, obliterating over 150,000 people. Humans are great fun.
t1_dssg5kx	0	*	I was hoping to see Liz Lemon.  So disappointed.
t1_dssik65	1	*	Maybe the other 10% are just SO bad at humor that the other 90% are all above average.
t1_dssihf9	0	*	If you think the general message of either book is peace, you've clearly never read them.
t1_dssk0w1	0	*	Religion is easily (and fairly commonly) used by scam artists. It's not a scam in and of itself
t1_dssje7a	0	*	Oh, well my bad. I would have put NSFW but look at the name of the sub. You dont want to know some more ambiguously titles subs. 
t1_dst5r1q	1	*	It sure as hell is easier than doing the same to an adult.
t1_dssi90m	1	*	You should work on your reading comprehension.
t1_dssyc8q	1	*	This basically. He wanted a miracle. Wanted to show us what the men he was fighting against had done.  
t1_dsskgrl	1	*	Probably doesnt even know that this is a bomb

t1_dssv74w	1	*	That's a new one for me! Thanks!  I like this one, too.  /r/PeopleFuckingDying
t1_dssn1m0	1	*	You're being intentionally obtuse.
t1_dssje06	0	*	Keep in mind that although there's some fucked up shit in the world, it's massively outweighed by daily acts of compassion and tenderness that only get noticed by those they directly impact.
t1_dsstk2s	0	*	On Reddit sync click the comment you don't want to see replies to anymore and click inbox replies. Turn 'em off. Voilxe0.
t1_dssirkd	0	*	No, me too. But Im starting to think that the link is a joke. Its got veryshadywebsite and worldstar in the url. I think weve been taken for a ride
t1_dssrw7i	0	*	>Im not sorry I offended you  The weakness you think you are finding in others is your own weakness leaking. Take better care of yourself. 
t1_dst9c84	1	*	You asked me a question, i answered it.
t1_dsster8	0	*	Agreed. 
t1_dssuqhi	1	*	Systematic desensitization

t1_dssjmsn	1	*	Grew up in farming country, most kids there wouldn't blink an eye when killing an animal, it's all in what you are used to.  The real travesty is killing people is the norm for that kid.
t1_dsst1ze	0	*	This might surprise you, but a lot of those better places you speak of are directly responsible for the situation in the Middle East and for prolonging the suffering there. 
t1_dst2n3w	0	*	Really? Cos it reads like an instruction, rather than a historical account. Allah must have just forgotten to add an update in their, right? 
t1_dssxcbm	0	*	Does it even matter if theyve read the Quran or the Bible to read some versus and realize that parts of them are violent?
t1_dssx3z5	1	*	15 years later and I can still vividly hear the sound of the poor Russian soldier beheaded by those Chechens. 
t1_dssqsnw	0	*	i'm not offended, mi edgy summer child. have a lovely day U0001f49c
t1_dst14x8	1	*	The reason they don't care is because they have no perspective on what that shit looks like in person. (Not a soldier here but a first responder).
t1_dst0fs5	0	*	The famous camel quantum instability happens when they start understanding that nothing should hold their constituting particles together. That's the problem with mathematics geniuses. 
t1_dssoxy0	0	*	Yet they're so quick to bring up Leviticus 18:22. Damn hypocrites.
t1_dsshfvd	0	*	The Old Testament is literally battle after battle, sending angels to be raped, destruction of the whole world due to flooding...need I go on?
t1_dssk3ju	1	*	I didn't misread it but I didn't see a shooting. 
t1_dst2d4m	0	*	The nick berg video will always be with me. I watched it when I was 14 and it will be forever ingrained into my memories. 
t1_dssi1kg	0	*	You skipped most of Genesis and Exodus I guess.. huge swathes of Deuteronomy too.... And most of Levticus... Yeah, you didn't really read the Bible did you?
t1_dssi2gn	1	*	For about 20%, maybe. 
t1_dstvxl3	1	*	Nobody's saying they shouldn't be free to believe. I'm saying that people who spread falsely confident answers about metaphysics and the afterlife are bad people.
t1_dst6tm9	1	*	You tell him hey, that guy's a baddy. Children are incredibly easy to manipulate. That's why they do things like this.
t1_dsskrbb	0	*	I remember many years ago ~2000ish seeing a video of a man stoned to death that had been snuck out of somewhere.  After that I avoid these types of videos.
t1_dsshgnj	0	*	The Bible is also taken literally by a lot of people. The evil is in the person, not the text they use to justify it.
t1_dsswsaz	0	*	Nice try, Nazi. 
t1_dssif72	1	*	Not everyone wants peace.  It's naive to assume so.
t1_dssljuw	1	*	This is a tried-and-true indoctrination technique for child soldiers. It happens down in Africa all the time.
t1_dssh6jn	0	*	Taken literally by whom? I think you're purporting to speak on behalf of an awful lot of people there.
t1_dssilpi	1	*	Go to r/watchpeopledie and sort by top of all time. It's up there
t1_dstcefj	1	*	Yes. It has passed almost 1000 years ago. It's not relevant and no one cares.  I'm concerned about what is happening today.
t1_dssoryp	1	*	Yeah, thats what I thought watching the video. But Im not a bomb tech or a soldier. Maybe theyre desensitised? Idk
t1_dssjqql	1	*	I haven't seen it, but I don't think this reaction would be abnormal for a toddler. They don't understand death. 
t1_dssjfrj	1	*	Yeh Ive looked into it a pretty good bit but Im not expert for sure.
t1_dssgto7	1	*	Oh I was quite aware of that, thanks for posting to let others know though!
t1_dstl1tu	1	*	What makes you think angry or teenaged? Straw men are easy targets. They sit right where you set em up.
t1_dst9058	1	*	They want you to believe that the next generation is already converted to terror from an early age and will be willing to commit acts of terror long into the future.
t1_dssjnoj	1	*	And! Upon further scrutiny there are 3 is in there and what do 3 is places side by side represent?  III  The number 3.   Half Life 3 confirmed!!!!  
t1_dsspb0m	0	*	At least that's by design for Discordianism, Church of the Subgenius and Flying Spaghetti Monster.
t1_dstcbk6	0	*	I'm concerned with what people are doing today. I don't care about what the Christian's did 1000 years ago, it's not relevant.
t1_dssux0x	0	*	Can I get a description? Don't want to watch it and too afraid to search it.
t1_dst5d39	1	*	I've got to hand it to you for getting to that joke before I did.
t1_dst6ijj	1	*	I am curious as to how one would decapitate a sheep with explosives. 
t1_dsu65u5	1	*	Yeah, we're talking about normal children though.  Not psychopathic ones.
t1_dstdgwg	1	*	Likewise!

t1_dsshxuw	0	*	Plenty of people take the Bible literally. The Big Bang theory was a lie- we were created in 7 days, there was a flood that destroyed the world, etc etc etc. 
t1_dssis24	1	*	Not that this should excuse any actions taken. It's a different culture and society. I wouldn't be surprised if this kid has already seen a dead person before. 
t1_dsske7z	0	*	Probably fake honestly. Just propaganda. 
t1_dstf6em	1	*	Yeah honestly at first I thought it was not real because the quality of the video is too good. 
t1_dst13tx	1	*	Hes probably seen heaps of executions.
t1_dsssift	1	*	How's Islam similar? Is there a New Quran I haven't heard of?
t1_dst3f72	1	*	just tell a kid that some people do not matter, are not true faithful, are untermenschen.  it is easy, the fact that it is easy is the scary part.
t1_dsso4l1	0	*	Good catch. SNL had a good parody of that on the Kumail Nanjiani episode this season. Beck pulls up in a Hummer to talk about the climate.
t1_dsspyu8	1	*	I love the horror  *horror in their hearts
t1_dssseoo	1	*	He's probably seen it happen countless times, it would just be a normal thing to him
t1_dswocsh	0	*	The last 4 words encapsulate my entire sentiment.

t1_dsx3q8c	0	*	Lol really? U0001f602 How am I more privileged than anyone else around me? By working hard and studying in school? If literally anyone can do it, then it's not privilege.
t1_dsvvse9	1	*	My grandparents live there!

t1_dsw35fv	1	*	I like cheese.
t1_dsw0qwf	1	*	Unlikely maybe. But maybe next one!
t1_dsx8c8g	0	*	Thats because we only accept 7% of our yearly immigration quota of 1 million from the same country. India and China have such long waits because there are SO many applicants from those countries.
t1_dsvnn42	0	*	bummerr what kinda work do they like in the netherlands?
t1_dswykjr	1	*	Yeah, I mean if theres just not space then unfortunately its the market at work, but if its mismanaged housing then its just shit. 
t1_dsvzjv9	0	*	They really should have prepped them to be able to shrug off 747s youre right
t1_dsw31zl	1	*	Architects got tiny dongs. Should explain it.
t1_dse4dbc	1	*	Tell us all about it.
t1_dt48264	0	*	> The key difference is in the US we can criticize those violations and change our government and use the means of due process.  HAHAHAHAHAHA my sides. Nothing worthwhile will change in the US.

t1_dt4w7lr	1	*	next bitcoin but kawaii
t1_dt4y1jn	0	*	Hxf6rrudu, your not Swedish! Get him boys!
t1_dt3yl6j	0	*	Like the history of China signing a human right agreement justifies that it can no longer arrest anyone in its territory.
t1_dt4m6cy	0	*	>ha, you think old people in China drinks coffee  Ha, you think people live till they're 'old' in china
t1_dt3yqux	0	*	OK Swedens are the morals saints who can judge every people. They are angels. They even invented some very important thing to ensure they can save everyone's life: Dynamite!

t1_dt4swwp	0	*	[ugh fine](https://imgur.com/p684g79)
t1_dt4llyg	0	*	As far as I could tell, they pretty exclusively drink . Sometimes   All of which are cheaper than coffee and tea (which is shockingly pretty expensive) in China.
t1_dt4r543	1	*	Yes and it's not that bad contrary to popular belief on Reddit. It's just that negative news gets spread more than positive news. 
t1_dt3yy0g	0	*	So the human right card? What won't you sink to to justify your World savior complex?
t1_dt4s2bk	1	*	I was thinking more population than land mass though. Otherwise Canada would be considered a shit hole when it's obviously not. 
t1_dt4kuhp	1	*	A true delicacy.  Although, up north the more popular fish dish is mxf8lje, which is fish liver and caviar.  [Picture of the dish](https://matartikler.com/wp-content/uploads/Skrei-og-m%C3%B8lje-2.jpg)
t1_dt4fnzn	0	*	Well, they [were](http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-37686968). From the article, looks like IKEA would rather them not.
t1_dt3ywq0	1	*	And you are so glad that you are not.
t1_dt4pk8i	0	*	Yeah maybe just a subscription system so you can participate. Especially on worldnews where trolls/shills are such a common problem.
t1_dt4uije	1	*	What's Hadrian then?
t1_dt4k1fh	0	*	Yep, mostly economy. *Arguably* if Japan maintained a military, it'd be at the very least competent and very well equipped, what with that military tradition and bushido spirit.
t1_dt4zyij	0	*	Yeah the rural areas are pretty bad, but a lot of the cities are good enough to bring it out of shit-hole tier. For me a shit-hole is a place where even the major cities are awful to be in.
t1_ds3ilqf	1	*	I know you don't think... But will you try and respond to my comment?

t1_dtg4o57	1	*	French here, fuck the boomers.
t1_dtg3u40	0	*	Ah who could forget that. You know your country is fk'd up when your father is DISAPPOINTED that your getting a university education instead of getting a full-time job. 
t1_dtg9e4k	0	*	In Australia retirement is funded by themselves though mandated Employer contributions. This doesn't incude casual workers.
t1_dtgqrug	1	*	Doesn't break that neatly along racial lines, but perhaps cultural ones for sure. Black America certainly hasn't had the same post-WW2 experience of unprecedented opportunity and prosperity. :/

t1_dtg7to3	0	*	Funny how they punish a nation for voluntarily leaving a supposedly democratic bloc. But the UK has far more to choose from than the EU when it comes to trade.
t1_dtg60er	0	*	How much avocado toast does one need to eat for it to be that or buying property?
t1_dtgcz7z	0	*	It pains me to see posts like this, that are so incredibly clueless but get upvoted because reddit is comprised mostly of other clueless people.

t1_dtg1slv	0	*	Don't be some melodramatic, the country will survive if people directly voted for the President.  Why should people's votes matter more because they choose to live in a less populated state?

t1_dtfzk0e	0	*	only naive people who 'WANT to believe' think any country today is run by voters. 
t1_dtg3vbk	1	*	Same in the US, but I feel like we have made it obvious with the screaming and politics

t1_dtg4485	1	*	Also it doesn't help when they see that it's just well... Republican war monger vs Democrat war monger. 
t1_dth4oe8	1	*	Woah you can read!!
t1_dthhuz5	1	*	Indeed they do, as of now. Unfortunately, younger generations tend not to vote. Thus, the effective voting power of the baby boomers is still greater.

t1_dtg8l1v	0	*	What? Do you live Sydney/Melb? I know Brisbanites who bought houses in the suburbs and they are just single income no kids.
t1_dtg7tto	0	*	Even just 15 years ago I could just wake up, open up the paper and have a job in a week. Now there are just less jobs and the ones available pay less when the cost of living comes into play. 
t1_dtg5olx	0	*	20 hours a week at McDonalds is no life, but it does mean you don't count as unemployed.  Show me the stats on how many are on over xa330k compared to 20 years ago and it's a different story. 
t1_dtg1unw	0	*	People don't understand because they aren't taught. It's like people don't seem to actually understand how their own government should operate. 
t1_dtfx7w3	1	*	Is that the point?    How strange for the guy who was making the point never to bring that up in our conversation.   Glad I gotchu to translate. 
t1_dtg8vov	0	*	Lol people are still defending the electoral college? When every other country uses a popular vote?  Now I'm gonna hear but muh small states! Muh tyranny of the majority!
t1_dtgb4os	1	*	I and you both live in the U.S. buddy, we already have divergent opinions, we are still both in the same country.
t1_dtfv6uy	1	*	So is giving in to their demands.
t1_dtg548k	0	*	Not for long. The EU is about to f@ck them over something fierce.  Hard Brexit here you come.
t1_dtgit59	0	*	Right, because clearly their issue is with the concept of immigration, not the actual act of brown people moving from less developed countries to Britain. Gold medal level gymnastics there.
t1_dtgnk4q	0	*	Pre revolutionary France?  I dont think huge rewards and huge penalties will get the result they want.
t1_dtg7x8q	0	*	Yeah, um, Mr. Hated Hillary, there were three million more of us who had the common sense at the time to not vote for Trump. But go ahead, tell us your come to Jesus way to late moment.
t1_dtgsc96	0	*	That's probably because you're projecting what you want to see onto their beliefs
t1_dtg1wud	1	*	And when republicans mess up so badly they cant even defend their actions they accidentally put a D next to their names. 
t1_dtg3ur9	0	*	Just out of curiosity what did Hillary do to you to prompt the personal hate?
t1_dtg36au	0	*	By everyone's definition, except, apparently, your's.

t1_dtgelo1	0	*	Enjoy the food, I guess.
t1_dtg9siq	0	*	Just that you need to have something to show for your life. If you're unemployed and drifting from job to job, then your criticism of someone successful is undermined.
t1_dthiblj	1	*	Good point, this is a common link. Someone from Hong Kong chimed in though with a similar story, I don't know if Murdoch has his grimy hands on their media yet.

t1_dtgb5cc	1	*	His name is OJ get it right.
t1_dtg72qe	0	*	Accessible rural is not the same as just not-a-city. Tonbridge isn't rural, but it's not a city. 
t1_dthi6zw	1	*	It's insane that this is nearing a global phenomenon. Thank God Millenials are wiser than their forbears.
t1_dthhnd5	1	*	Great insight, thanks.
t1_dth0b35	1	*	Oh, I think you're right about it mostly being trolling: that's why the kid who was dumb enough to actually eat one and burned his lungs made the front page!
t1_dtgfct2	1	*	same in the netherlands the +50 crowd owns everthing ....
t1_dtgeask	1	*	They should put it on a bus!

t1_dtgkzpp	1	*	Can confirm, my aunt did exactly that. 
t1_dtgof03	1	*	It's not like everyone in the east of Germany is poor though. Maybe people are just scared of what they don't know (well).

t1_dtg9cnt	1	*	Hes not that wrong tho

t1_dtg9mpu	0	*	Yeah bought first house on outskirts of Seattle at 24. Not that it's easy but still do-able. Definitely not as easy as the older generation leads on though.
t1_dtg287c	0	*	Eh, this is more of a thing for people who subscribe to tribalism.
t1_dti8ua2	0	*	No you can't. All Nazis are fascists, but not all fascists are Nazis. 
t1_dthhdvu	1	*	You'd think you'd be more self-aware than this. Sad.
t1_dtgitfj	0	*	I had no idea about this, does it apply to all nationalities? What about nationalities that can only be expressed with one word, such as Canadian (as far as I know)? 
t1_dth9ivg	0	*	The fuckup was making a 100-year contract, which let Hong Kong go back under Chinese control in 1999.
t1_dtg97kd	1	*	Sorry, this has nothing to do with the actual content of your comment, but... Surely you meant to say *worthless* rather than *worse-less*, right? 
t1_dtgfc93	0	*	You would rather make it easier for t_d brigading to happen than have t_d brigades?  What?
t1_dtgdftj	0	*	I thought those were tabloids.
t1_dtfx6zz	0	*	Amazing. Its always the left who likes to argue the right are those that resort to personal attacks, and yet I have said nothing untoward but you are attacking me? Hilarious. 
t1_dtg7xzf	0	*	EU freedom of movement rules. This is basic stuff, it shouldn't be news to you. Schengen is only about passport checks, we can't stop them coming in.

t1_dth5qoe	1	*	great to know no matter where i live im still getting screwed!!!!!!!!!!!
t1_dtgb78d	0	*	They even suggested taxing foreign income for any company that does business in America so they could tax that income.  The amount of stupid that entails is mind boggling.

t1_dthik4z	1	*	Yes, social democracies are the only thing maintaining a stable world it seems. Never forget how lucky you are!
t1_dtgwp4p	1	*	Then everyone is a Millennial as everyone is living in this actual period and culture. If he was a kid hiding from Nazis in WWII, then he's the Silent Generation. That's the definition of generation. 
t1_dtgdvxt	1	*	Wouldnt it be United... nations?

t1_dtg50vy	1	*	His name was Merrick Garland
t1_dtgn1cm	0	*	Shocking a pm that is in power because she supports Brexit is still supporting Brexit. Also I don't think a man who stepped down because he didn't want to deal with Brexit is a good example to follow.
t1_dthdirq	0	*	I'm just saying that this generation has been the worst offender 
t1_dtg67kp	1	*	Right?  Wages and career opportunities were insane back then.

t1_dtg43mj	1	*	While I don't agree with what the person you replied to said, your argument using a subreddit is just as meaningless
t1_dth9b0k	1	*	The United States was a colony though, clearly the greatest natural resource a country has is its people.
t1_dtgn41r	1	*	Count me in!! Lol
t1_dtg6ue3	0	*	Are you also riding a moose right now?
t1_dtgfonx	1	*	Yeah, like stopping the sale of lightbulbs as electric light just because they are producing much much more heat than visible light.

t1_dtg968w	0	*	Except that there are a lot of shitty jobs paying below the cost of retaining said job.  But hey at least unemployment is low.   That sounds nice on a press release.

t1_dtgefg4	1	*	Owie, dad
t1_dthi02i	1	*	Nah, they're just the loudest. His base is predominantly white males, especially older and rural ones.
t1_dthrz2v	1	*	You liar, theres only two seasons in Canada : Winter and Construction.
t1_dtgex51	0	*	Someone said to me once that the only people worried about immigrants taking their jobs are people who would not get said jobs anyway.
t1_dtiaxon	1	*	Same dude, only he said DIE IN FIRE. He has to be bait. I guess random dudes from Philadelphia have strong opinions on UK politics.
t1_dthe645	1	*	Ah, who could forget Fictional Past? Those were good times. Remember when everyone had twelve houses before grade school?
t1_dthhr90	1	*	Seems to not be as big an issue in nations with great social safety nets.
t1_dtgbqt4	0	*	Well in the uk, I think the average house price was 3x average wages in the 80s but is now 5x
t1_dtggez7	1	*	It takes a lot of time and effort to undo, though. It's much quicker to burn a bridge than rebuild it.
t1_dtha32s	0	*	You have the option of spoiling your vote, eg. 'none of the above', you just have to actively participate in the process or pay a small fine.
t1_dtg9fky	1	*	Both countries that may try to leave the UK in order to stay in the EU. They are also much farther away than Europe is.
t1_dthduf4	1	*	What part is why the rich get richer, etc.  I'm not sure what part you're referring to.
t1_dtgc4bl	1	*	Wages were less but it was easier to get a decent paying job. It's now immensely harder to get a job with the pay required to afford a house.
t1_dtge3ch	1	*	Socialism, sounds like Communism too much, and Papa fought in *Insert mid 20th century war here* to protect you entitled brats from it
t1_dtg6cdp	0	*	>Trade agreements can be remade in the next presidency.  Not if no-one trusts you anymore.
t1_dtgcjbo	1	*	People in this thread are absolutely clueless and if you do even a small amount of research you'll see that they're talking out of their ass.
t1_dtg3w9l	0	*	So far... yep.
t1_dtg6g7b	1	*	It's more like the EU. If you think of the States as States it makes sense.
t1_dtgh5c8	0	*	Did you mean opium? 
t1_dtg012c	1	*	And we got rid of our EU problems in 2016.
t1_dth6q23	1	*	Yeah that I can agree with!
t1_dtg1jpl	1	*	Exactly, that is exactly the problem.  It actively discourages voting in most states, because there is no realistic possibility they will not go the way they always go.
t1_dtg6378	1	*	Good.  
t1_dtfxniy	0	*	Because they haven't been wrong, we haven't even left yet.

t1_dtg3rr2	1	*	I think you have it a bit wrong there... it's all about money. fox was created because most news stations were pegging their view and were afraid to pander to the crazies 
t1_dtggx3z	1	*	if you are outside my imediate family you are just numbers to me.
t1_dtgbttl	0	*	so by spewing retarded bullshit, you are elevating the conversation?  perhaps a well thought out defense, based on logic and evidence, might be a better method of doing so.

t1_dtm2lb1	0	*	I really feel sorry for people that fall for cryonics, its pretty tragic.  Its a company that finds people who are scared of death and then takes all of their money and kills them.
t1_dtm34ip	0	*	This is classic communist propaganda. The same brain excrement that birthed Soviet Russia.
t1_dtm0gmg	1	*	Fun to watch people do it though.
t1_dtm2g9m	0	*	Isn't cryonics basically dream science at this point? Have they successfully frozen and thawed anything monkey sized? 
t1_dtm1ukf	1	*	It's a story about Stan Lee. There is no place in this thread for Trump.
t1_dtm47je	1	*	Plague doctor, we're referencing a [Monty Python skit](https://youtu.be/HLgQMtquS6Y?t=1m10s).
t1_dtm20am	1	*	What strength did you try first? Willing to bet that may have been a factor of the dislike.

t1_dtue287	0	*	maybe i'm not just calling them capitalism because i don't like what they do but rather because they're literally the definition of capitalism
t1_dttnhd2	1	*	Ok, so to be clear you think it was trash for the other countries, which would have approved it, but not for the US, which cancelled it.  
t1_dtwr0gx	0	*	Your country refused to take part in it? So who were those soldiers killing, raping, and bombing Vietnam in the 60s? Youre full of shit   2 million civilians dead isnt something to be proud about

t1_dtu586s	1	*	I suppose part of that would be educating folks on laws that contradict societal values and the Bill of Rights so perhaps voters will consider it and constituents will write letters.

t1_dtuhi9i	0	*	Therefore we should continue on with our destructive ways rather than learn from our mistakes and better ourselves for the survival of our species?

t1_dttpm9r	0	*	More like AI take over 
t1_dttvla7	1	*	Actually there is only about 100 million years for complex life left on this planet. Which is much less time than the Earth has had for evolution already. We could already be past peak biodiversity.

t1_dtttc9s	1	*	With capitalism, corporations are usually privately owned. With communism, corporations are usually owned publicly, ie by the workers. The difference is purely economic in theory.

t1_du194l1	0	*	Im not dissagreeing with you. Just trying to explain it.

t1_du2bmih	1	*	If you read the wiki on [FGM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Female_genital_mutilation#History) it clearly states that it was practiced before Islam.
t1_du2szjz	0	*	I'd actually say Yahweh is far worse than any of the Greek gods; *they* never committed genocide or demanded human sacrifice.

t1_dufrl6j	0	*	Look it up. Im not trying to be an asshole 
t1_dug629a	1	*	Yeah I think we're on the same page. Anti-circumcision for the future, but also anti hoopla about circumcisees from the past.

t1_dulfiac	0	*	But they don't and the fact that you agree with them is a testament to the failure of your country to provide you with anything beyond basic scientific literacy or logic.
t1_dug750j	0	*	>  ... first  That's the voice of your lack-of-empathy talking. Sane people want to solve human problem, whereas feminsts cannot see past female problem.
t1_dufdu6u	0	*	What if we did circumcision inside the womb? Since its not a baby yet it wont feel any pain. Problem solved  
t1_duft88e	1	*	Huh, that's the first I've ever heard that. Rather depressing... No alcohol, no music... What kind of God would declare would declare two of the greatest things in life as bad?
t1_dw0unut	1	*	I meant if people in the world do it, it's for religious reasons much of the time. I could have worded it better.
t1_duhgss5	1	*	You not heard of keratinization?

t1_dugjc40	1	*	Indeed it is, and indeed they are. However they wear tights from like October through April because its too cold for them haha
t1_dufhfvs	0	*	I feel like you took that a little extreme there.   When I said extra. I meant excess skin. As in you could remove it and still be completely covered in skin.

t1_dsihe6l	1	*	Bro she ran a terrible campaign through and through on top of being an awful candidate
t1_dskfsab	0	*	Exactly. That's the problem with research today.   Go ahead and downplay it tho. I'm sure your precious research papers you rely on quoting are perfect.

t1_dub9v9j	1	*	Im sorry, I meant to respond to farmtownsuit
t1_dubgih6	0	*	The fee is elastic depending on the USD valuation of BTC.  Because of the volatility, its a shitty fee no matter the value.  Thats why a bunch of alt-coins are more viable than BTC.
t1_dubk37p	1	*	They were here from the start
t1_dubt9ef	1	*	Yeah that's nice. Us poor folk will go back to our lane, take no risks, and stop trying to claw our way up to a better life. Sorry to waste your time boss.

t1_dtcpny8	1	*	It's almost like geopolitics influence politics.
t1_dtcspt2	1	*	No because their popularity has already decreased beyond the point that they can carry 2018 or 2020. Theyre dead, they failed to tank. 
t1_dtcu4xc	1	*	The hes in the last sentence are [unclear pronoun references](https://writing.wisc.edu/Handbook/CommonErrors_PronRef.html) which caused your confusion. I also was thrown a bit and had to reread.

t1_dsa4onb	0	*	Nobody got that reference bro
t1_dsaafpz	0	*	Putting a label on some things to remind people how much needless suffering and death they cause isn't anywhere near too far.
t1_ds9xluz	1	*	sorry.
t1_dsau4q5	0	*	We don't. There are over 400 million vegetarians on planet earth doing just fine.  Every single nutrient you get from meat you can get from elsewhere.

t1_dsabrmn	1	*	but if he walked he would have missed the train, duh
t1_dsa2woj	0	*	There are farm animals already dead whether paid for or not. They have been killed for humans to eat. What kind of cunt then decides to go and kill another animal instead of eating that?
t1_ds9y48l	1	*	Hahaha! He stuck the batteries up his butt! Hahahaha! 
t1_dsac1ru	0	*	Is that entertainment the consumption of the dog for food? Because if it is, which is what we started talking about, then a number of cultures would say yes.
t1_dsaaxp3	1	*	That just refers to a kind of church.  Its like saying you are a democrat, so you must believe in everything they party says.
t1_dsa2s8b	0	*	Just the tip?
t1_dsa1h5e	1	*	Did you just post your first response so you could give this one?  Just shut up. 
t1_dsak1zb	1	*	Except invasive is a technical term and does have an exact definition. Which the species in question does not meet. 
t1_ds9z12q	0	*	Sure, but Im watching television. You really dont believe Bear Grylls could survive too? He just made a TV show that packaged the useful information in more of a palatable way. 
t1_ds9wss4	0	*	You're talking about the camera men, he is talking about the contestants, I believe.
t1_dsa1ac3	1	*	Still had to go through selection and training and is considered by the British Army to be SAS. There are plenty of reservist US SOF units.
t1_dsa66qt	0	*	Above that, Noshamina's first post, the second comment in this chain.
t1_dsa1fx5	1	*	It's the dilemma between pragmatism vs idealism. Always interesting to consider this tension :D 
t1_dsa0ez5	0	*	Do you or dont you think that Grylls could survive on his own and do all the things he does in the show?
t1_dsa3lg4	1	*	Deep.

t1_dsbr4vm	0	*	Are you implying that people who aren't vegan are just too lazy? That's a pretty narrow world view 
t1_dsacl9u	1	*	You can also reduce it. Your bodily fluids will immediately boil in hard vacuum.
t1_ds9woty	1	*	Farm animal already dead. 
t1_dsaa277	1	*	Kill one *imported* animal, on the island.  Fish aren't on the island, they're in the ocean.

t1_dsaprtw	1	*	Yes
t1_dsa225p	0	*	The crew and Probst sure, but the survivors stay on the island.
t1_dsa15y5	1	*	A real survival expert will tell you that it can be drank 2 to 3 times over before it became poison.   In that situation, the other option was death.
t1_dsa8wip	0	*	I really enjoyed that show and wish there was more of them. 
t1_dsbkr4v	0	*	Which makes the term invasive lose all meaning so we have to draw a line *somewhere*
t1_dsa9w0g	1	*	So are Human primates. Maybe they could eat each other like on Easter Island.
t1_dsa28ey	1	*	Shitting liquid is one thing, but you know things have really gotten bad when you start coming meat.
t1_dsbcdcx	1	*	I can see your point, but at the same time I can't help but think oh man, that's such an american way to think

t1_dtn0jnj	1	*	All right, thanks.  Happy Cake Day btw!

t1_duaqv6f	1	*	Like i said, the UK is the largest tech sector in Europe, so your example would be better suited to a very small tech sector, so is a mute point.

t1_dub3mm2	0	*	You're trying to argue that because Bernie is shitty at politics that Clinton should run with her arms tied behind her back?  Whine about SuperPACs all you want, they are legal.

t1_dua9x87	1	*	I agree
t1_duaykib	1	*	That's the one!
t1_duaaoqa	0	*	That's exactly the reason. Same reason Turkey and Russia don't like supporting secessionists, as it would give encourage their minorities to do the same.
t1_duac6w0	0	*	No, that's the country. You mean Steven Seagal.
t1_dua3nzf	1	*	> he'd get more done  That's... that's the thing that I fear is true. I fear he would get even more done if he had a clue how this government thing works.

t1_e1jhv4p	1	*	RemindMe! 992 days 
t1_duai3jp	0	*	Precisely. Also the tax cuts, at least from what I heard from my red state neighbors. They'll let the vain idiot call himself president as long as he rubber stamps things for them.

t1_duabg3e	0	*	RemindMe! 992 Days
t1_dua5jvq	0	*	Agreeing on what it means to leave the EU is different to whether leaving the EU is a good idea or a bad idea. Is that simple enough for you or do you need a diagram?

t1_dua9v97	1	*	If the accounts can't be signed and the books aren't balanced that is a problem though.
t1_dua23dp	0	*	I think we'll be waiting a long time for that, friend.  Who wants to live in a gilded cage?
t1_duaixx2	1	*	He took that statement back almost immediately after the result.
t1_duabx6g	0	*	Yea, I'm sure with enough fear mongering & time you'll eventually get your way...  
t1_duabj3w	0	*	I doubt it. Most Trump supporters are pretty pissed at him for all that lying. (Bringing back coal/manufacturing/jebus/whathaveyou.)
t1_duabzly	1	*	Nooooo
t1_duami6j	1	*	You are such a loser. Cant even have a constructive conversation without being triggered
t1_duac9lo	1	*	You're preaching to the choir here, I am in no way pro brexit.  It is easy (for me) to understand a large amount of people who voted for brexit thought they were doing the right thing though.
t1_dubylbg	1	*	Yes the emphasis is on the first syllable
t1_duakn83	1	*	That's why I think that a referendum needs a super majority to change the status quo. 55-60%
t1_duaf4jg	0	*	I dont think any culture is worth preservation, they will lose against the inevitable march of time
t1_ds38tba	1	*	You have, otherwise you'd go mad with how ignorant humans are.
t1_ds38uzp	0	*	I mean yeah that's what most people do. We all think we're special. And hate can make us better as a species, it drives us.
t1_duzg69k	0	*	Saying that only one company is allowed to use natural water is... guess what... regulation.
t1_duz61n7	1	*	Its called corproatism and its what fascism is based on - most people do not realise that this is the unique identifying feature of Fascism.
t1_duz5r6i	0	*	How does taking a bribe or kick back make one a victim?  
t1_dts74pq	0	*	He was charged with unauthorized access for breaking into a network closest after being banned from their WiFi. Not saying the punishment fits the crime... But it's the law.
t1_dtsvbnm	1	*	Not saying the punishment is commensurate with the crime, but it's not as simple as he pirated his school's publishing cloud.
t1_dstqz6b	0	*	The Normans settled though, they built forts to make sure the removed Saxon nobles didnt try and reclaim it.
t1_dsuegog	1	*	> They couldn't afford to maintain bombing runs on the RAF due to casualties  If you have a source for that I'd like to read it.
t1_dsu5shf	1	*	That's the main historical thought - William's half brother, Odo Bishop of Bayeux commissioned it is the most likely to have commissioned it after he was made Earl of Kent.

t1_duqubg7	0	*	FDR's presidency was closer to 100 years ago than 50.

t1_dusafkt	0	*	I have concerns of you can't understand why Ivanka Trump is not a qualified advisor to the president. This is nepotism. She and Jared are unqualified.
t1_duqjst0	1	*	She's an advisor to the president.  That's actually really easy information to look up yourself.
t1_duqquh8	0	*	The Korean (its actually the original) version of the Good Doctor is amazing.   My family also enjoyed Coffee Prince, Youre Beautiful, and Pasta.   Variety shows are also awesome. Love Running Man.

t1_duqvk18	0	*	Putin's paying overtime, eh?
t1_durlens	1	*	Not much effort is really needed...
t1_durdyi3	1	*	It's not about underestimating him. It's about overestimating the people who vote R as having some sort of line they won't cross. 
t1_dur4jjh	0	*	> The real problem is that we don't want this type of corruption to repeat post-Trump  No. The real problem is having this type of corruption now.
t1_durz07v	0	*	The current regime does, and they play into the fear of the uneducated.    Due process.  Impeaching trump would put Pence into his place.  Any better?  Probably not.

t1_dur9zkw	1	*	I think you're about spot on, even if you are a dirty godless socialist.
t1_duqx6ek	0	*	Democrats have been the ones pushing against it for decades. Look at which states have signed on to the National Popular Vote Compact.
t1_duqvcxf	0	*	> Why should NY and Cali get to rule Texas, and every other state just because they're so populated?  Why should Texas get to rule Cali and NY in spite of having fewer people?
t1_duqy08e	0	*	I guess you didn't watch it.  Because he said, if she wasn't my daughter, I'd date her.
t1_dus8nxt	0	*	Not wanting unskilled persons to illegally enter the country isn't white supremacy.

t1_duqnlhn	0	*	It's called reality, I hope someday you will join me. But let's step back, would you style yourself a progressive?
t1_dur42db	1	*	Oh absolutely. You could not have picked a worse person to run a country. 
t1_dur6psp	1	*	Because America is a conservative country. At least relative to most of the rest of the Western world. 
t1_duqy97h	0	*	A city with a population 10 times larger than Alaska 
t1_duqvhpm	1	*	Googled it and apparently it's about a man who is allergic to people and has never had a gf. And then the man meets a robot and falls in love. I can dig this premise.
t1_duux3ex	1	*	Recommend reporting like I did; that dude is being a troll and harassing you. Not sure why he thought himself so clever to throw in his attention seeking insults in the middle of our conversation..
t1_dusnv6q	1	*	Just like it was a 99% chance Hillary would win, right?
t1_dur5gac	0	*	Literally betrayed the country? Are you living in opposite land, where Hillary went on stage and asked Russia to dig up dirt using cyber-espionage on her opponent? At a rally? To the cheers of fools?
t1_durw7ig	1	*	It's all relative. What politicians are labeled conservative in your country means fuck all to us. I'd expect you to think the same of ours. 
t1_duuydu2	0	*	Not America. 
t1_dur4w8u	1	*	Literally almost anyone is.  It's the lowest bar conceivable.  Trump is a bar that is self-lowering.
t1_dur62bq	1	*	What's the percent of politicians jailed vs found guilty compared to the same groups of professionals?
t1_dsuqm7z	0	*	I'm pretty sure the number was 1.5 Trillion OVER TEN YEARS, correct? Isn't it true if the economy keeps getting better than that cost will be covered?
t1_dsv9g28	0	*	Probably Russia.
t1_dsux32a	1	*	Username not relevant
t1_dsvb8c4	0	*	Why don't you provide a source? 
t1_dsv4jkc	0	*	Probably better. I'm not saying Trump's a good President. I'm just saying Potus gets credit for deciding to sign a bill, its why he's there. Its his function.

t1_dsv5jxo	0	*	are you fucking stupid?
t1_dsvqyds	0	*	Cutting taxes for the middle class isn't trickle down economics btw, time to go back to 9th grade civics class! 
t1_dsus650	1	*	> Obama was extremely involved with writing the ACA  He was not, Heath Care lobbyist were, but he was not. That is not how government works. If you have proof of his involvement please show it. 
t1_dsupz2q	0	*	The ACA is substantially similar to what Obama proposed as a candidate
t1_dsw8fvx	0	*	Hahaha. Okay buddy. The best bit about watching Trump supporters bend themselves into pretzels over shit like this is that they're already as salty as can be.
t1_dsup9v6	0	*	Good luck buddy, you can't expect Republicans to argue facts, or have facts to back up their arguments.
t1_dtq55ng	0	*	let the record show I said a president I can't imagine any doing this them selves out side of washington

t1_dtdjtu5	0	*	talking to the wrong guy
t1_dtcpdso	1	*	*Even*! Oh, tell that to the supposed Communist sympathizers during McCarthyism. They may be delighted to learn that... those of them who have managed to still be around, anyway.
t1_dtdoru2	0	*	NK had nukes 10 years ago...
t1_dtdf6w5	1	*	I'm now a huge success.
t1_dte23du	0	*	It's not hard to get all the info on internet. The POTUS and his admin need to implements in order sanctions to work. You think POTUS jobs just signs shit and go to golf?
t1_dtdchuq	1	*	This response is all wrong. I think you're supposed to call him some names and denigrate his intelligence a bit, before calling him a coward. It also helps if you swear a lot.
t1_dtdeg2b	0	*	Too many maniacs with guns then? Wait... but... isn't this the very same argument for more gun control?
t1_dtdb8a9	0	*	Exactly, so why would they undo their hard work and denuclearize them? 
t1_dtdwqau	1	*	Maybe. Maybe a sufficient number of researchers and engineers. 
t1_dtdwkbf	0	*	> with zero risk of retaliation  Yeah, I dont think so. They will definitely have time to hurt *someone* (South Korea for now).
t1_dtcn2uk	0	*	Nope. During
t1_dtd3v26	1	*	What?
t1_dtdaxy2	0	*	It's not deflecting to point out that there's nothing wrong with the practice, for your car theft example it would be like saying there aren't laws against that so it's not stealing. 
t1_dtcy3w6	1	*	Whataboutism
t1_dtcvl1m	1	*	America !== President's decisions 
t1_dtdlpxp	0	*	Theyre way better off than before Putin so I doubt it. People remember he dragged the country out of the chaos and into safe waters. 
t1_dteyps7	1	*	Haaahahahahaha holy shit. Was Bork a double-agent?
t1_dv0rpfg	0	*	Harvey Weinstein is a jew. That means, based on this very verifiable fact that that anyone can check, that I'm a nazi? You're the one who can't accept reality.

t1_dstblpw	0	*	you're a neckbearded tool that clearly didn't even read his post.
t1_dstp5ju	1	*	My guess is Paul Ryan. Hes a weasel but I think hes too much of a choir boy to do anything illegal. Hell defend clear illegal activity if its a republican but I dont think hed do anything himself. 
t1_dstc6uj	1	*	I don't think he cares. It's money he can pocket.

t1_dstd47u	1	*	I like your last point, and I never thought about it.   Now that the tax bill has been passed, I'm sure they'll be happy to take any opportunity to dump the orange scourge from their party.
t1_dstdom9	1	*	Thanks for the tip, I'll check that out!
t1_dstl6r5	1	*	trump did, its crazy
t1_dstw95q	1	*	Disclaimer the issue cannot be wether Im smug, Ill conced that.
t1_dstwmgs	0	*	Seriously? Wow. How so?
t1_dsta9gj	0	*	Tbh I didn't watch the trailers. Westworld is highly relevant to my interests so I just dove right in.   Also I'd have to agree. Why wait? Just watch an episode already.
t1_dstdoz0	0	*	But Snoop said...
t1_dst9m3a	0	*	He probably molested the poster boy already 
t1_dsts0oo	1	*	Officially Trump said on NBC that he fired Comey to end the investigation.
t1_dstvxrc	0	*	sure, yeah, mkay.
t1_dstjbpy	0	*	Twitler said it himself.
t1_dstfavu	0	*	So potentially this is something Bannon could verify (Comey was fired before Bannon was let go IIRC)?  That would give Muellers investigation some teeth I imagine. Or am I barking up the wrong tree?
t1_dsv7xd8	0	*	Who appointed Rosenstein? 
t1_dstao7m	1	*	>eh  That's ours. Give it back, please and sorry.
t1_dstdrcc	1	*	Thank you. It's going to be an interesting period of history for future kids to study!
t1_dsttn5i	1	*	It also doesn't have anything forbidding them, so it would fall to other laws or case precedence and wind up at SCOTUS.

t1_dstu8qe	1	*	I'm just waiting for Bloobath 2018.  It's going to be a massacre.
t1_dstxuil	1	*	It does seem to be a bit of an own goal.
t1_dst7bqv	1	*	I am a little curious what this line of questioning has to do with the bannon subpoena. Care to explain?   Seems like a distraction from the topic.
t1_dstq5tr	0	*	Ahh, that makes sense. Thanks for the explanation. Would he be allowed to simply not speak at all? 
t1_dsuv1o6	0	*	So there's a way to go before this could get anywhere near an impeachment?
t1_dstxar1	1	*	The world is what you make it.

t1_dsq080t	0	*	Then I guess most teenagers are criminal?

t1_dspgm8d	0	*	Well, it's not entirely clear yet. It does state that most shared it a few times and a small number shared it hundreds of times, so we are probably going to see very differentiated fines or sentences.
t1_dspkbxw	0	*	Oh I'm terrible sorry for speaking out against a law that I disagree with. From now on I'll simply agree with every law without ever questioning it.
t1_dsx8w9t	1	*	I dont think you have read the laws, and I dont think you have any knowledge of the Danish justice system.   Either that or you are willfully being ignorant.

t1_dspistk	1	*	Did they give consent to the video being shared?  That's the CONSENT that matters here.  Look, having a thing for adolescents is hardly rare or new.  Dial it back, Humbert!  
t1_dv2olrx	1	*	Indeed. Peace brother 
t1_dv37r66	0	*	Yeah, no.  Not fomenting the nuclear holocaust is a pretty low bar you've set there.

t1_dv3fs8o	1	*	Right. The book goes much more in depth as to the reasoning.
t1_dv3c901	0	*	I mean, he can't have dumped *every* stat, so I figured it had to go somewhere. Bonuses to skill checks based on target stats seems pretty likely, though.

t1_dtjk6y6	0	*	Sure, you might be right. Either way, the conversation is much more productive if we are focused on primary source information rather than our distrust of each other. 
t1_dtime8p	0	*	Better the Chinese spend the R&D money inventing it than the US spending the billions just to have the Chinese steal the tech and ignore the IP.

t1_dtidz8y	1	*	The law of demand exists whether or not you want it to.   Price goes up, quantity demanded decreases. It's that simple.

t1_dt6sscr	0	*	That's been a large part of the problem.  Just think of each page as a special exemption for a particular special-interest group and you wouldn't be far off base.
t1_dt77wds	0	*	This is why California's legislature passed a bill in the house to double taxes on businesses. Fuck the rich.
t1_dt6z9za	0	*	No, both companies are terrible.
t1_dt7bisd	0	*	Funny how taxing corporations properly is considered socialism by you idiots.

t1_dt6x30v	0	*	Wait, -22%? Is the Italian government *paying* corporations? That IS insane 
t1_dt6yq00	0	*	Yeah, nice thought but the AI would be expensive as fuck 
t1_dt7d754	1	*	Yea no thanks. I'll keep my money then spend it as I wish, vs. handing it to the government and hoping for the best. 
t1_dt6nz1o	0	*	The longer Obama's been out of office and you're still embracing his hand the funnier this is to me, so thank you. He was a terrible president and I regret voting for him in 08.
t1_dt6zqdr	0	*	How that is legal blows my mind.  If a person works 40 hours a week they should be able to afford to live. (Mind you at minimal means) 
t1_dt6ibqw	0	*	So you are for sponsoring refugees but against social welfare? 
t1_dt73s9a	0	*	Student Loan Interest deduction remains.
t1_dt758z0	0	*	Would you rather these people be unemployed?  They pay what people are willing to accept. The other choice is no work at all... 
t1_dt74n0z	1	*	Remember the past few decades where the left has tried to make the world a better place and the right has, for the most part, not?  Yeah fuck that ever happening again.
t1_dt6zlp6	1	*	Doesnt the same apply to the US and its states? We were speaking federally, I thought. 
t1_dt6y7bk	1	*	You do realize that if that case went to court Canadians would of paid a lot more then the Millions we gave to him.
t1_dt7954j	0	*	I think in the context of the Davis summit, corporate taxes, and these super rich attendees it's fair to point out tax rates on the 0.01% types and not America in general
t1_dt71e3n	0	*	Huh. Well IANAL.
t1_dt774c8	0	*	I personally think all income should be taxed, I was asking for clarity's sake and find the discussion interesting. I am a landlord myself and that income is taxed.
t1_dt733oj	0	*	Oh please, the GREAT majority of illegal immigration is people who overstayed their visas, not people who jumped a fence.
t1_dt6ylbk	1	*	And let's remember that this one was barely given a proof read before being passed.
t1_dt6wt35	1	*	2 states have 0 percent, out of 50.  Let's not act like that is the norm.  
t1_dt6iqs4	0	*	k
t1_dt767g4	0	*	Wow that's a great find. I never opposed the corporate side of the recent tax cuts and knew our rate was high but not that the effective rate was that high.  
t1_dt73hxi	0	*	My tax rate is significantly higher than that chart when you factor in my local, county, state, sales, social security, unemployment, disability, property and school tax.
t1_dt73xaf	1	*	That guy can't even write decent English. It's like they aren't trying anymore.
t1_dt6x410	0	*	That's a fair opinion but to suggest we go straight to zero is absurd. Why would anyone suggest that?  You stay competitive but don't accelerate the move to zero more than necessary

t1_dt73my7	1	*	How big is your penis

t1_dt6o34c	0	*	The US is the largest GDP in the world, with the entire EU coming in at #2. Naturally the leader of this country holds a great deal of power, as we've seen with the stock market since Nov 8th, 2016
t1_dt6z9oz	1	*	He does like movies. Saw him at the theater with his entire family going into anchorman 2 (and yes this was when he was PM). You have to be really into movies to bring your entire family to that 
t1_dt7xl9i	1	*	I was thinking the same thing. 
t1_dt73xnd	0	*	Correcting someone's false beliefs with facts is not asking for sympathy. Nor is it a plight. But you can believe that if it makes you feel better about yourself. 
t1_dt73cyi	0	*	Yes, those big corporations will literally just immediately move their headquarters out of the US, and you'll be able to tax them for exactly 0%. Then guess who's making up that tax shortfall? 
t1_dt6wne5	0	*	You have no idea!   This is not a game people are loosing theirs job left and right here in Canada! Canada will be a welfare country until it can't be anymore!
t1_dt717x8	0	*	Can I see your source for this? Sounds interesting.
t1_dt7uoog	0	*	Where in IL are you that your property taxes are such a low rate?  My house is only worth ~$125 and I'm paying $4200 per year.
t1_dt71q1v	0	*	Well, then I just create a ThomasVeil Corp. and let my money grow in it's accounts.
t1_dt6z5w5	0	*	Wait. How is the DOD not the biggest in the US then?
t1_dt6zp53	1	*	The US has state taxes on corporations as well not factored in there...because were talking federal. 
t1_dt735sv	1	*	That's kinda absurd. People who worked hard for their pay deserve to keep as much of it as they can. Taxes should be mandatory but not unreasonable.
t1_dt6z22k	0	*	PS is one of those companies you're referring to Walmart? Last time I checked they took their repatriated cash and the SLASHED jobs. Great recipe for growth right? 
t1_dt7qn4q	0	*	Thats the fundamental difference.   I believe a full time employee deserves a comfortable middle class lifestyle.   Im interpreting your statement to read that unskilled workers do not. 
t1_dt7459m	1	*	It seems like 12 years of university to make 45k might only make sense if you are a tiny violin player...
t1_dt6z7vm	0	*	The other guy was talking about employment, all I said was it takes longer than 25 minutes to post 50 comments. You didn't factor browsing time into that calculation.
t1_dt74idz	0	*	They are ACTUALLY paying their taxes. Elected representatives have put laws into place that make it possible for them to reduce their level of taxable income. Dont be a simpleton.
t1_dt8xlql	0	*	Why do we talk about anything but the effective tax rate?  What is the difference between the effective rate and the whatever other rate that is often cited?
t1_dt6y8jm	1	*	They say that 70% of the world's tax literature is German! 
t1_dt79fia	1	*	> We do pay the full unsubsidized cost.  Nope, you dont. All students are subsidized here. For an idea of what it really costs, check the US tuition fees for med school.
t1_dt74ij5	0	*	while true, but most other countries don't have the international presence that the USA has.
t1_dt6w5gb	0	*	Its also because Delaware makes it easier to do business. 
t1_dt6utr1	1	*	Huh I figured it would be more than that. 
t1_dt750c6	1	*	What an asshole answer.
t1_dt6ty7n	1	*	Australian here,  I think tax cuts are a bad idea if you are running massive deficits.   We have the same problem with our own conservative government. 
t1_dt9ddz3	1	*	Rack 'em up
t1_dt6xfs7	0	*	Someone has to pay taxes.  It's corporations or it's you.  If you decrease the taxes on one then you raise it on the other or you expand the amount you are in debt.
t1_dt75vpp	0	*	But don't most people in the Netherlands forego purchasing a new car?  Mostly because of the way public transit and the country is laid out?
t1_dt729z5	0	*	You would need to have more than 750k mortgage interest to be worse off. Basically anyone telling you this owns a house > 1 million in a high tax state.. in which case, they are fine, trust me. 
t1_dt71h5o	0	*	Lol. Wait until they cut Medicare and social security, robbing you of the money you have already paid into it. Then we will see about that victory...
t1_dt6za6h	1	*	Any company that paid and treated its employees well enough, regardless of state or federal laws. 
t1_dt72fu3	0	*	Thank you for the details!
t1_dt704sx	0	*	The Palestine Liberation Army?
t1_dt792r8	1	*	I think that the overall point is that there are scenarios where people that make over a couple of hundred thousand dollars will end up paying around 50% in taxes on some portion of their income. 
t1_dt7xlnd	1	*	Wow. Guess I called that. 
t1_dt6o4v0	0	*	I'm not going to keep reiterating myself when you have no plan to even observe my findings
t1_dt723lo	1	*	The bare minimum effort. I asked for examples from our current government, not the entire history of our nation.

t1_dt6x5ec	1	*	Back when I didn't know boring was a trait I admire in politicians.

t1_dt7j8i9	1	*	Cooked in a Dutch oven?
t1_dt707hz	1	*	Corporations have been buying tax breaks for decades. Takes a lot of paper to keep track. 
t1_dt72u02	1	*	I don't know about that.  Remember the Great Taste, Less Filling wars of the 90's?  Scary stuff.
t1_dt70vqh	0	*	Yes
t1_dt77cno	0	*	This is why Trudeau/LPC is still popular: those talking points are weak as hell. Like grasping at straws covered in Crisco.
t1_dt74wwj	0	*	You're like a professional REEer, huh?
t1_dt6xsue	0	*	There wasn't a lack of effort, they mailed 15,000,000 households in Canada; there was no consensus for election reform. People didn't want it.
t1_dt70t12	1	*	> Really they didn't lie by saying one of their smaller branches was responsible for most of the money made?  They didnt lie because they made it true.  
t1_dt7236w	0	*	Have you ever been to... other states in the US

t1_dt74bln	0	*	The other option was a black youth are super-predators candidate, so would you consider us super far-right as a nation if we elected that one as well...?
t1_dt7o29k	1	*	Not really, it's just a shorter way of saying it.
t1_dt743p3	1	*	How so?  (Legit question, I havent had time to look into it)
t1_dt6z54c	1	*	Olive Garden. Duh 
t1_dt6y644	1	*	As marijuana companies are showing us, the threshold to be a billion dollar company is actually quite low.
t1_dt78hql	0	*	Because predicting the future is not an academic venture. It is at best, speculation. I know you're a tory or w.e. but I shouldn't have to explain this!
t1_dt7ozxc	0	*	Ah, yes, I remember when we taxed Exxon-Mobil 90% of its income. Wait, how much did they pay? Oh, right. They had so many subsidies, the government paid them.
t1_dt6pmig	0	*	Yes I do? Are you aware the ACA includes a clause forcing employers with over 50 employees to provide insurance or pay a tax penalty? That's clearly what I was referring to. 
t1_dt7dsoz	1	*	That works too.
t1_dt74hrc	0	*	No because they make the least. If you need social benefits to support yourself then you clearly are in no position to give back.
t1_dt782w1	1	*	waiting for you to respond to the other comment is torture. 
t1_dt6wpmz	1	*	I like you.
t1_dt6z4x6	0	*	It is exactly like they pay much less overall. Obviously some tax is still paid, which is what an effective tax rate is. No foreign bank accounts needed.
t1_dt748ln	1	*	I thought the Indian railways were the world's largest employer, but I guess that's not private....
t1_dt7dame	1	*	30 years?!? Why 30 years?!
t1_dt71bhc	1	*	Hey
t1_dt70hve	0	*	I'd bet that immigrant will pay his taxes once that happens. 
t1_dt6nybu	0	*	Uh, we subside farmers to *not* plant corn and leave fields fallow...
t1_dt7f3vm	1	*	Did I say tax companies 90%? wtf? I just want them to pay all the taxes they are supposed to. And I want them to stop having so much damn influence on this country. 
t1_dt73jzx	0	*	43/50 states have income tax, and everyone has to pay FICA tax which is 7.65%.
t1_dt6i0dw	1	*	Agreed. Not saying we should just do a flat tax. Incentives can be good in helping to grow companies but the complexity of the code has got out of control. 
t1_dt8bagx	0	*	Did not realize walmart was a small business.   They pay ~30%
t1_dt720b5	1	*	Wrong country, wrong government.
t1_dt6iw2d	0	*	So can you elaborate more then on how we can credit the economy growing for 8 straight years to Trump?
t1_dt6ugna	0	*	Do want business or personal marginal income tax rates?

t1_dt8hj6a	0	*	Oooooh spoooooky.
t1_dt6memd	0	*	We're talking about Muslims not brown people. Not all Muslims are brown and not all brown people are Muslims. Why are you so racist?

t1_dt6lfqr	0	*	Indeed. Maybe he can link them before he tries to make stuff up.
t1_dt6l9ky	0	*	Then you'd realize that the problem is much less related to Islam than your ilk wants to believe.
t1_dt6j3bf	0	*	He didn't. He also said It's far fetched.  But he is replying to someone who is proposing a hypothetical situation.
t1_dt86djg	1	*	Source? And it doesn't matter if second generation immigrants does that, we have a continous flow of first generation whose birthrate is far higher. 
t1_dt6pnt0	0	*	Could you answer my other question?

t1_dt6urz6	0	*	Can you really not tell the difference between Islam and race?

t1_dui5pg6	0	*	I don't think anyone really disputes that.  What is disputed is whether there should be tighter controls on /r/iamverysmart to limit their uninformed comments from polluting other subs.
t1_dui2mx6	0	*	Lmao simply downvoting me doesnt make what I said any less true. You literally dont gain anything from ignoring Chinas problems which its own government is admitting it has. 
t1_dullxjb	0	*	Why arent mobs dragging all accused child murderers out into the street?
t1_dsr7l70	1	*	It's very common tbh. My pulmonologist spent 40 minutes of my appt once telling me what order I should teach social studies and why. 
t1_dsp0o4g	0	*	Don't you have some thing better to do, like arresting the mayor of London or something? 
t1_dspqdoe	1	*	You're right there. Well, I love my students, but the other stuff... Let's just say if I win the lottery or my writing gets big, I ain't staying. 
t1_dsqoqzr	1	*	No, though looking at Los Altos the general scale is similar. Ranging from 63k-123k compared to 55k-125k for BS through MS75+ at step 30. 
t1_dsq4qwc	1	*	Heh, looks you mates have got a situation similar to 2000s America. Everyone was a house flipper and looked how that turned out. 
t1_dspxiej	0	*	No, but planes will be used for about that long. F16 has been flown since the 70s and is still in service. 
t1_dsp75ik	1	*	Let's be honest, no gym teacher is fit. The job requirements are overweight and owner of short-shorts.
t1_dtl07w3	1	*	Youre ignoring the fact that usage did greatly reduce however. And THAT is the main point.
t1_dtl26af	1	*	I am quite certain that even in the US the police is attacking noone with acid. And my point is that having guns makes it **more** likely to be attacked by the police not less.

t1_dtl4eav	0	*	The point is if citizens didnt have guns, the police wouldnt need them either. They could survive with tasers and other non-Lethal weapons.

t1_dtr573t	0	*	It's made by that ex federal employee whose opinion you don't value.
t1_dtr7nyz	1	*	I'm learning here, and I appreciate that loads. This changes a lot for me and my opinions. Thank you. <3
t1_dtr0jrc	0	*	Part of being a citizen of a country is accepting responsibility for your leaders actions. If Trump did something stupid, could you honestly claim not to be partially responsible? 
t1_dtqqdyv	1	*	They were still alive. That would imply that they did *not* surrender and die.
t1_dtr9xj4	0	*	>You think the average Japanese person living in Nagasaki or Hiroshima was doing these things?  >they were actively aware of it  Haha, you're even dumber than I thought. 
t1_dtrlirn	1	*	But no less true. An army acts on the cultural values of its population.
t1_dtrqdx0	1	*	Unfortunately, in a total war, there's no such thing as an 'innocent civilian'. 
t1_dtqtmrp	1	*	So it wouldn't make sense to have a war on hunger, and yet we have one.
t1_dtrjz0k	0	*	It seems like smarter more modern weapons have counters to them that can be developed.   Thousands of rounds of artillery? Yeah good luck. 
t1_dtsmhwg	1	*	Starting a war doesn't make it OK for the defender to do anything and everything. America even agrees about that.
t1_dtq81qx	0	*	you:  > we had another 6 atomic bombs **ready to drop**.  me:   > number three was a week away from having a plutonium core  you:  > .....so?
t1_dtqy8ls	0	*	Was it not Truman who ultimately decided to drop the bombs?

t1_dts295k	0	*	Revenge for one naval base isn't worth killing millions of people?
t1_dtsua8c	1	*	It was still about the US' decision to use smaller nukes which was the main topic at hand, stop being silly.
t1_du9kf07	1	*	They don't. But that doesn't mean the US as a whole doesn't.   Why do you pay taxes sheep? 
t1_dsqq2jh	0	*	No. Counting non voters as anything is a ludicrous idea.
t1_dueggmx	0	*	Maybe if you a philosophy student living in an ivory tower. In the real world when survival is at stake, morality and ethics get a hell of lot grayer.
t1_dsgtxis	0	*	You don't have empathy, is what they're saying
t1_dsgtyiv	0	*	They didn't teach their child about the real world, and how shitty people can be
t1_dsvypip	0	*	Yeah, that's the same as invading another country, kill their people, occupy their land and force them to pay billions of dollars as settlement 
t1_duc7qwr	1	*	Im really grateful to live up north. 2 bed terrace, 20 minute train ride from Manchester in an ok village for xa372000.

t1_dtr6pf8	0	*	If you want to own that, fine but then why make up the rest of the absurd set of excuses?
t1_duajo0q	0	*	People who dont vaccinate are a danger to society and people have the right to protect themselves from danger.
t1_du5unc7	1	*	Mass hysteria on a world scale. When corporations accommodate counterparts based on doubts, it says a lot. My company is not the only one redirecting business meetings elsewhere. 
t1_du5t74r	0	*	The last time I went to kentucky for business. There were 3 junkies laying on the floor in the McDonald's bathroom.
t1_du69uez	1	*	'Safe' does not mean the same thing as ANY of the following.  * feeling welcome  * risk-free  * convenient and easy  * absent of concern  America's not the place it once was. 
t1_duh9rs1	0	*	A LOT of the internet is hosted by and comes directly through Google and Facebook. Not 'very little' https://www.businessinsider.com.au/google-facebook-news-traffic-chart-2017-5?r=US&IR=T
t1_duh4dua	1	*	Who pays other companies that then pay google with that money? 
t1_duho8jl	1	*	laws or rules. pretty important distinction. Legitimate is not necessarily directly pertaining to codified law. Regardless, I was simply correcting the poster. 
t1_dtr63t5	0	*	LOL your crying over American expansionism?   Just imagine for a second if China had the geopolitical sway that the US does.
t1_dtbewwr	1	*	South China Sea is also in the northern hemisphere. Just saying.

t1_duff91k	1	*	You just need to buy some bootstraps.
t1_duhagzw	1	*	I'm honestly not surprised. A lot of the people that fall into the last two also don't trust both the government, and the banking system. 
t1_dugtvhq	0	*	Port capable of docking a cruise ship or 'port' in general?
t1_duflmuo	1	*	Probably close, but just with our local cultural spin.
t1_dujehph	1	*	NO IM ENTITLED TO MORE THINGS   Stop buying so many products and save up. 
t1_dsl7ini	0	*	Partial quotes don't back your stance either. They didn't say We don't recall. To put their words in ELI5 terms for you: As far as we know, he didn't say that.
t1_dsl6gbh	1	*	Wtf are you talking about pls work on your reading comprehension . 
t1_dsl7l6m	1	*	Answer my questions instead of spamming me with links with no context
t1_dslxeun	1	*	American here.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_s9FNlQDdA  That video sums up the Trump presidency. Nobody's died yet though, so it's fine.
t1_dslwbpw	1	*	Indeed I have! My apologies. 
t1_dt03l20	1	*	Depends on how you look at it. The outlying areas are more likely to have large IEDs and ambushes. Kabul is more likely to have carbombs and suicide bomb attacks. 
t1_dtv3te1	0	*	So Israel should just ignore them and let their citizens get kidnapped?
t1_dssnruq	1	*	Pride and accomplishment.
t1_dss6ii7	0	*	Unfortunate for them? Seriously? They tried to scam their employers with a fake degree and a fake interview, they are as honest as those Nigeran princes with their billionaire legacy!

t1_dsrmudv	0	*	You really have no idea what you're talking about or who you're talking to.
t1_dsruyt3	1	*	uhh i never suggested i was giving up my integrity, i'm just suggesting we destroy the system that enables the corrupt to gain power over other people.
t1_dt82t6l	0	*	Oh you mean when Obama killed the space program? http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/80beats/2010/02/01/obamas-nasa-budget-so-long-moon-missions-hello-private-spaceflight/
t1_dt7xo3z	0	*	To be honest I would watch that sci-fi show. Although it is kind of Mass Effect in earth orbit.
t1_dt90u4m	1	*	How does it bait you? The Trump admin DOES want to end NASA funding for the ISS. If the title included the fact that it was supopose to be end in 2024 anyways then the title would be the article.
t1_dt7vdq2	0	*	Obama did SFA apart from giving them trucks, training and weapons.  Hillary said that in Syria Al Qaeda in Syria as they used to be called were actually the good guys.
t1_dt7szcp	0	*	Lol :P People that think companies are ahead of NASA and government space programs :D Musk is like 50 years behind NASA...
t1_dt952av	1	*	NASA pays almost 3 billion to keep the ISS running. or almost 15% of their budget. and that is just our share of it
t1_dt8a41m	1	*	Sounds like Job Creation to me.
t1_dt93cgq	1	*	it is and has been talked about for a long time. The big downsides are:  * more launches more worries * space construction doesnt leave much room for mistakes. 
t1_dsmk6hg	0	*	We give them fuckloads of forign aide. In fact we have been the primary donor for the past 40 years by a huge margin.  They get help, still a shithole.
t1_dsmknms	0	*	That's not an answer. Does he or does he not pay his own company millions of tax payer dollars on a semi weekly basis so that he can play golf?
t1_dsmdugz	0	*	Yeah I was going to add Medicare fraud to that list too but didnt feel like explaining it. 
t1_dsmfi51	0	*	I was indeed being sarcastic.
t1_dsme877	0	*	You need to be this tall to ride. This is a game only the big boys can ride on. You can go play in the penny arcade games and expect the tax police to come shake you down. Be nice. 
t1_dsnvqth	1	*	Finally they can put their Soros money at work!
t1_dsmqlc7	1	*	Yes, you probably can hide the ownership of something you own for as little as a couple thousand a year. But, what for, if you're not filthy rich?
t1_dsn97gz	1	*	Do you honestly believe the Democrats have put any significant effort towards cracking down on this?
t1_dsm9zxa	0	*	Past
t1_dsmghps	1	*	Probably not, hard to pin down the source of Baby Docs money.   Unlike Clinton, where we could pin down the source of the money. 
t1_dsmfuu4	1	*	You need to have illegal money to play.
t1_dsmfmoe	0	*	It helped a lot. Thank you. That was a far better comment than I was expecting. Youre awesome.

t1_dsmfy2d	0	*	>what about this other  >That's not whataboutism.  What. 
t1_dsmf248	0	*	Am with HSBC, they're a fantastic bank. I enjoy that they're drug money and mafia money launderers because the Vatican also does this and therefore my bank is godly. 
t1_dsmc4af	0	*	So... What's it like being a formerly living Haitian dictator?
t1_dsmuwz9	0	*	Are you arguing against one conspiracy using another conspiracy?

t1_dsn34l1	1	*	You get it. 
t1_dsmhage	0	*	Why wouldnt he sell?
t1_dsme6yt	0	*	Multiple reports from regulating bodies, all public record.   Reports from the Haitian government, which is also public record.   They're not writing a book dude. 
t1_dsmoxne	1	*	LOL the FBI doesn't need buzzfeed to investigate Trump's criminality, idk where the fuck you're getting that from.
t1_dsme2n4	0	*	It would be a red flag in USA if the condo was in USA. But if you buying a condo in Haiti, what expertise would USA authorises have on value of condo?
t1_dsmnrmf	0	*	Are these houses... the type of houses that aren't really houses but made to feel like houses. As in.. did your briefcase have more than 200k?
t1_dsmny28	1	*	Closest you can get down there is trying to launder dirty bitcoin
t1_dsnsy0j	1	*	Damn, I feel bad that the only thing I could think of while reading this was how awesome it would be to have such a 'job'. 
t1_dt3jse9	1	*	What the fuck? Says Who? He's a citizen like anyone else. 
t1_dsmvrrg	0	*	Just FYI, you can sign things with your professional or colloquial name and have them be legally binding. 
t1_dsmtlsn	1	*	Oops.  Large parts of the dossier have been corroborated.   And don't forget the republican link to the initiation of the dossier.   Ppl who want the truth don't look for ways to dismiss so quickly
t1_dsmc6zm	0	*	It'll do until the impeachment proceedings begin. 
t1_dsmf6xb	0	*	Did you buy into the Wolffe bullshit or do you only buy into bullshit that matches your worldview?
t1_dsn4ei0	1	*	Yes that makes total sense...
t1_dsmf96n	0	*	The GOP we the first to find it BTW. So yeah GOP, Democrats, Law enforcement, that seems pretty Bipartisan to me.
t1_dsmg7qa	0	*	Anyone would sell it.

t1_dsmocqt	0	*	The country is terrible and it can only become terrible by the people in the country. It's not because they're black
t1_dsmj478	0	*	I mean, you have a point, but the Wall Street Journal *usually* doesn't report things that are truly unsubstantiated when it comes to Trump.
t1_dsme7s1	0	*	It was already at the highest it was before he got into office. He rose the wave. Yet another person who believes trump hit a triple but started on 3rd base. You must kill at parties. 
t1_dttemaz	0	*	Anarcho Capitalism is Astrology for men.
t1_dtrz6og	0	*	I wouldn't call a knee-jerk hypothesis a source. It's hardly a inventive one either, so perhaps it either proven or disproven somewhere. Care to back it up with the former?
t1_dttm3n1	0	*	Obamacare just another layer among many enabling rent seeking. 
t1_dtr890v	1	*	I'm not going to talk in absolutes but I doubt many pretend that the quality of care in the US is bad.

t1_dso824j	0	*	I don't know what worse honestly, annexing a country or invading a country to steal their natural resources.
t1_dsoajvp	0	*	The US caused far more deaths than Russia in the last 30 years 
t1_dspcg4t	0	*	According to those who oppose it. And the Russian troops are welcomed by the majority of Crimeans. I don't think they give a fuck about your opinion.
t1_dso9mzi	0	*	What??? Texas says hi.
t1_dspp7rs	1	*	Thanks. 
t1_dsoq9hh	0	*	It is still an astoundingly hostile and aggressive act of war. Try invading or even attacking Hawai'i or Alaska and see what the US does.  Eta   [Oh, wait](https://youtu.be/3wxWNAM8Cso)
t1_dsocwf8	0	*	So bloodless annexation is worse than bloody invasion according to you.  How moral and humanistic
t1_dspb5ja	0	*	Putin acknowledges that collapse of USSR was a disaster.  > I dont know what else you want.  How about a quote of him saying he wants to re-build USSR.  
t1_dsoj5rk	0	*	So you're saying Russians aren't doing anything wrong ? Or what ? 
t1_dsornv4	0	*	I agree that the Donbass rebellion would fail without Russian support. That said, though, I have previously read that about 80% of the separatist fighters in the Donbass are actually locals.

t1_dt8f6fc	0	*	Por que no los dos? If the world begins running out of water but the US doesn't, you will need the guns also. 
t1_dugc5ib	0	*	Well have her try out for an Olympic curling team then, since she's apparently doing the exact same thing at the exact same intensity.
t1_dugr75s	0	*	Again, guilt by association.
t1_dt5ku0s	0	*	Its the same every day, DOJ admits they had usurped the power of congress, documents show the FBI had it out for Trump. I would hope everyone would agree thats not supposed to happen.
t1_dufgzks	0	*	I know that Chavez claimed there were multiple coup attempts. But I'm not aware of any that could have wrecked Venezuela's economy.
t1_duev8jh	0	*	South Korea

t1_duehhgx	1	*	I'm not talking about the lack of response but the reaction to the act itself. 
t1_duemvzn	0	*	Keep handwaving. All it would have taken was an EO, because GITMO is a military installation and prison.

t1_dugix80	1	*	Kids
t1_dug3nog	1	*	Revolt and revolution will destroy america , you are advocating exactly what  putin would want.   The US strength lies in its institutions and military. Not in their destruction. 
t1_duett5k	1	*	So you think that the US collapsed Venezuelas economy by calling them terrorists? And that it had a 10 year delayed effect?  Is that your best evidence?
t1_dtt53g2	1	*	Noted, but don't worry, I'm booked up for months. 
t1_dtsdead	0	*	Just look at his post history. He's not interested in having a balanced opinion, one way or another. He just has an axe to grind and it'll probably be different next week.
t1_dtss5tv	0	*	drowning is anything but calm and painless, possibly one of the worst ways to go imho.
t1_dtswfov	1	*	So by mentioning that you fear a pro-torturer would use your greatest fear against you, would that not actually be your greatest fear?

t1_dt54skw	1	*	I'd also note that the framework of the ISDS is considerably less concerning when the United States is not a signatory. It was mostly about the IP laws for me though of course.

t1_dt5q4lv	1	*	The finite verb is controlled by the subject. The subject is not a finite number but a finite number of ways. Therefore the finite verb is second person plural, in this case of to be, i.e. are.

t1_dsz5xyj	0	*	I'm not trying to defend the Turkish government, I loathe them just as much. But saying that PYD represent the Kurdish people or saying that they aren't indeed terrorists would be false as well.

t1_du53fvs	0	*	negligence is rearely the mens rea for a crime, can you point to the money laundering statue that specifies negligence as the mental state?

t1_du4s1yz	0	*	There should always be suspicion, but blind distrust is just as ridiculous as blind trust.
t1_du4xcih	1	*	That's not really why you buy land as a nation, though. We bought Alaska because it gave us territory in an otherwise difficult to reach area, increasing our access to Asia.

t1_du4sa4w	0	*	I really don't get what you're trying to say.   My point is that one vote should always count for one vote, no matter where you are from or where you live. Anything else is unfair and undemocratic.

t1_du5duce	0	*	Odd. There are a bunch of weird businesses that also use that address. Some appear to have been there when Trump owned it? 
t1_du4mozq	0	*	This post is all speculation. You have no idea what the property is worth today or what the motivation of the buyer was. Based on credible reports the Russian lost money on the deal.
t1_du4k4ny	0	*	Money laundering is not bribing.  It is making the money look legit.  Trump certainly is tasked with funneling some of this money back.
t1_du4s206	0	*	while normally you would be right if it was something that could easily be infered as stolen like a car for instance, but with a real estate deal its way more difficult.

t1_du4pmqv	0	*	You dont understand 
t1_du54mig	0	*	Yes, but (in this case) the existing bank was a Russian bank and could be seized at any time. Moving it to a safe (non-Russian) bank was preferable.

t1_dv4ech5	0	*	>Yes...   >Also the Vatican has a King, it's a theocratic absolute monarchy.  Just like the UK then! 
t1_dv5ikhw	1	*	Yeah, in the absence of water you can clean yourself with dirt to prepare for prayer, thats what Teyemmxfcm is essentially.
t1_dv4c8di	0	*	Society and common law dictate what he deserves. Not some bloodthirsty goon on reddit.
t1_dv48tfm	0	*	I'm not from America. I'm sure your prisons, too, are brutal. 
t1_dsk9sa4	0	*	Russia will support the left or the right, and all points in between.  Whatever furthers their goals.
t1_dsjitko	0	*	Give us a source then.      They wanted something to force his arrest.
t1_dsjkeih	1	*	Source but even so he still needs to leave the UK which will extradite him.
t1_dsl8gkw	0	*	So what you're saying is that he should have been remanded in custody until his trial. 
t1_dsma1x7	0	*	haha somebody watched wormwood
t1_dslcsul	0	*	And yet, you still stand with the opinion rather than the fact
t1_dskjyh8	1	*	What some swede official says, even publicly, has no legal consequence. Just like you or me saying the earth is flat has no effect on the actual shape of earth. 
t1_dskmgp1	0	*	Pinochet: 10^4 dead  Communism: 10^8 dead  'nuff said
t1_dsjyevd	1	*	Correct, the UK authorities. 
t1_dsjxhd5	1	*	He doesn't have to be a fringe character to be a fucking fruit cake
t1_dski0ex	0	*	xa33k per shift would pay for 18 people per shift at xa320 an hour which is fairly decent pay. How huge is the embassy that they need 18 people to watch it?
t1_dskkfub	0	*	Arrest? Trial? Rape?  That's a weird way of saying wanted for questioning.
t1_dtm1hdo	1	*	Fine, a few thousand? Doesn't make much of a difference when we're talking about billions.
t1_dtbuzrm	1	*	> Neither Trump's America First and Jinping's shared future for mankind are attractive propositions.  
t1_dtbsvog	0	*	> kills 60 million of its own people for **wrong think or being the wrong ethnicity**  Learn to read. 
t1_dtbr1th	0	*	Really? Yes the USA is very diverse, but the disparity isn't so large that they're incomparable to other nations in the world
t1_dt9s45c	0	*	There is a lot of that going on around this site mass killings and roots like that would make anything better. The same people crying about humanity and morals are yelling for the blood of the rich.
t1_dt8pv6c	0	*	You're pretty sure?  Have you even done any digging to see?  By all means, don't take my word for it.
t1_dt8msw7	1	*	But limb bot, when I go to edit the post it shows that it is still there, why limbbot why
t1_dt8le23	0	*	I'm just curious if you ever feel empathy in general for people
t1_dtgzxgq	1	*	Yeah I mentioned that in my first comment (the Wong Wei bit).
t1_dtw77d3	0	*	Russia isn't our enemy, we're not at war.
t1_dtwawhs	0	*	So just let trump have them? What insanity.
t1_dtwf0p9	0	*	We're not dealing with World war II spies, we're talking about a guy that lies to protect the reputation of Russia propaganda 
t1_dtwxt52	1	*	I recognized that immediately, I was curious if there was some real argument behind it, or if he was just having fun with the quote....  In today's sociopolitical environment, you never know....
t1_dtxi1hl	1	*	Yeah... the Bernie Bros didn't do him any favors
t1_dtx3tff	0	*	> We are all very much the same at the core.  There's literally no evidence of this. They, in their own words, are Christian (Dominionists) first, Republican second, and American last.
t1_dtweo43	0	*	They don't make false equivalences, Obama is a muslim! 
t1_du3u7ip	0	*	So far, you've responded to 3 of my posts and nothing you've said has made any sense

t1_dtx4kmx	0	*	Deutsche Bank
t1_dtw75yy	1	*	Lay down with dogs get up with fleas.
t1_dtw3nak	0	*	We're talking about a potential video of Trump and russian prostitutes doing sex acts and urinating on the bed Obama slept in. It's more than just a sex scandal
t1_dtw54yc	0	*	Are you saying Trump is illogical and unreasonable? Or are you still pretending he didn't call Democrats treasonous?
t1_dtw6q4m	1	*	I said the other options were possibilities too.   Is that an absolute? 
t1_dtvvpkq	1	*	Lol. Just an inkling?  
t1_dtx876g	1	*	3 week old account who only has 2 comments with a positive score more than 1. 
t1_dtxjlhb	0	*	Yeah but that doesn't actually stop them from accessing their assets in other ways or getting support from the Kremlin.
t1_dtxbysh	1	*	I'm am American. I wish I didn't have to care about American politics...
t1_dtxm249	1	*	Don't worry politicians usually aren't brave either. I say usually because there are exceptions that spill over from military
t1_dtxnbub	1	*	NOW KISS
t1_dtwk99y	0	*	What makes you say that Putin is one of the most effective leaders? Are not most people in Russia doing rather poorly relative their level of development as a country? 
t1_dtwd8vp	0	*	Is it imposible to have a second round of elections over the two mayorities? Even with the electoral college it would be something.  I'm not american so I genuinely don't know
t1_dtw6rz4	1	*	O'DOYLE RULES! 
t1_dtwgbx6	1	*	> I think it's faulty to assume he listens to anyone.   Okay. You do that. I will make my assumptions and you make yours.

t1_dv6196o	0	*	She's being prosecuted for posting videos of executions, not her words
t1_dv0y7br	1	*	Free speech is protected under the French and EU constitution, if these laws would fall under Free speech(witch they dont) they would be overruled by the courts.
t1_dv0qjap	0	*	Yeah, good thing is doesn't happen every week here.
t1_dv0m87a	0	*	You're wrong.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Article_10_of_the_European_Convention_on_Human_Rights
t1_dv0w0gt	0	*	We can post sex on Twitter and not get charged for it.
t1_dv17ewn	0	*	While the US has its share of faults, a lot of Europe is pretty backwards when it comes to freedom of expression.  Le Pen's *true* crime is that she hurt the feelings of a particular type of person.
t1_dv0wsnb	0	*	holy shit you keep getting DESTROYED in the comments, lol I'd go take a cold shower bud before you get more rekt than you already are
t1_dv10w7l	0	*	Good to know! Thanks for the research!
t1_dv1aqdc	0	*	The difference is Freedom of speech isn't Free speech. That's two different legal notions.
t1_dv17zut	0	*	freedom of speech without obscene graphic violence?
t1_dv0rc6e	0	*	you can't shut me up, I'm American
t1_dv0vjij	0	*	I know child pornography exists, I dont have to watch it.
t1_dv1s1zr	0	*	Not many, and only if said speech directly causes immediate physical harm.
t1_dv0y7ha	0	*	Doesn't apply to le pen
t1_dv1aoil	0	*	The state of emergency ended in 2017, during the summer.
t1_dv0t9jj	0	*	No Im asking how the French government is threatening to use violence in this instance. Not what the punishment for threatening someone with violence is. 
t1_dv0qxtn	0	*	You'd be happy with allowing your kids to see and watch terrorist decapitation videos because of free speech? 
t1_dv14sbp	0	*	I think that she could make the case that people would have to 'follow' her to see the images so that they had opted in and so she was not posting them publicly.
t1_dv0po7i	1	*	Speech in the US is certainly not free, considering that to be heard you need a lot of money.
t1_dv1kxn4	1	*	Both are in pretty poor taste, but personally I don't think either should be illegal.
t1_dv1a1sp	0	*	Ah, so you just have to hope the majority of people vote for politicians who aren't bought by the organizations who want to keep on abusing their monopolies.  Shouldn't have expected much from ya.
t1_dv0r4e3	1	*	Opinions can't be policed though... Nor are beliefs. Acting out on the opinions or beliefs is another story.  
t1_dv1lt4w	0	*	But it is. We don't need the right to dish out death threats and incite murder of a certain race/religion.    If you need that sooo much, be my guest. We're happy without it.
t1_dv1lijj	1	*	dont forget videos of farms.
t1_dv0k68v	0	*	Theres no difference nowadays
t1_dv0unsj	0	*	not if it violates french law
t1_dv24730	1	*	The only thing that's stopping you is the age verification message. 
t1_dv11yvv	1	*	you are talking out of your arse. spending time on there doesnt mean you are  a killer.
t1_dv16iyn	1	*	I read your post as complaining about police resources, not court resources. My bad.
t1_dv22l5s	0	*	If ISIS rapes an adult woman and makes a video about it, is it ok to spread that video?
t1_dv1fg8b	0	*	I've never seen decapitation pics or videos. They have never been forced upon me like she did to that guy. I could prob find some if I was into that crap. No need to post it on twitter.
t1_dv0mba7	0	*	which is exactly what ISIS wanted, btw
t1_dv1571e	0	*	A teenager in the US got arrested for saying fuck while calling 911.  I would never live in such a society ;)
t1_dv1au2s	1	*	America's so backwards, then again in this instance it seems France is somewhat too.. This really should be a thing where twitter does the spoiler block and you have to choose to click it
t1_dv0sz04	0	*	Its not about bloodlust. Its about seeing death. Its a part of life we've shut off and don't have easy. Access to anymore. Its not good for the soul to ignore death.
t1_dv0oncv	0	*	So she has responded to everyone who criticized her?  How many people does she get to respond to, in your estimation?
t1_dv18bgy	0	*	Hey kids, you better get prepared for the real world ! /s
t1_dv1xsy6	0	*	> You really should not have to see pictures of it to understand how terrible it is.  If that were true then people on the Left wouldn't be able to pretend Arabic culture is equally civilized.
t1_dv0m0w5	0	*	We should be allowed to and people getting charged for sharing it with people is a joke.  We need freedom of speech!
t1_dv1ccvd	1	*	Thats directly threatening violence against an individual. That should be the only limit on a person's speech.
t1_dv0wpoz	1	*	You dont get jailed for wrongthinking. You get jailed for wrong doing. We have 0 clue what LePen thinks. We just know what she says 
t1_dv1f2r4	1	*	It's freedom from repercussions by the government, but not your fellow citizens. 
t1_dv0nal5	0	*	So you can post some child porn in the U.S.? Whoops, looks like you don't have 'real' freedom of speech either.
t1_dv0qrm9	1	*	I agree which is why I don't think it should be illegal, but I don't think it's fine either.
t1_dv1lv3z	1	*	Well thats an opinion. I'm not familiar with French politics but round here the problems are blamed on race or religion which detracts from the real issues.
t1_dv0rk3n	0	*	> no one wants to shoot up a school.  A lot of school shooters beg to differ
t1_dv19fmk	0	*	I have, they aren't the only countries in Europe, and certainly not highly populated.  Can you please tell me what rights are more broad in europe?
t1_dv24jvo	1	*	Also rape, sexual assault...those are okay to show as well, but a set of boobs!? Dear god NO!!!!
t1_dv19gmd	0	*	This was on twitter, and it was hastagged...  If crooked Hillary tweeted a photo of Trumps tiny erect penis, I can guarantee she would be on trial within a second.
t1_dv1fs1b	0	*	Look up it's founder, Pen's father.
t1_dv0tko6	0	*	Still a federal crime as of today.
t1_dv1xpng	1	*	I know right? Imagine a world in which the US was free to have romance novels or even pornography. But it will be a cold day in hell before the clerics allow that!
t1_dv0qwqx	0	*	So you admit that's exactly what's occurring, but deny Europe is like that. Hmmm
t1_dv0rli1	0	*	No answer?
t1_dv0p6l1	0	*	So you don't think ISIS using those images promotes terror?  How is this different?
t1_dv27lal	0	*	Barely.  Like the smallest possible exceptions.  Like.. must result in immediate violence type restrictions.  Not speculatively either.  The threat of violence must be sure and immediate
t1_dv0yoxn	1	*	I thought it was more of a poor defense for herself. Her party was accused of being no better than ISIS and she posted that to point out they're nothing alike 
t1_dv3rkeo	1	*	you softies would probably give Hitler the royal treatment as well
t1_dv1h06x	0	*	/r/shitamericanssay
t1_dv1h3qo	0	*	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miller_test  Yes, they have.
t1_dv1bg14	0	*	Probably because treating every Muslim as a terrorist would be irrational. 
t1_dv1mvsz	0	*	This has to be the most idiotic post in this thread. Congratulations 
t1_dv0kxd5	0	*	I'm not offended. You're offended!
t1_dv0n3cv	0	*	> How can you be charged with a crime and not arrested for it?  ...  Really? People get charged with crimes all the time without being arrested. 
t1_dv1nw4x	0	*	I didn't say that. Please stop being wrong. 
t1_dv1glcf	1	*	In /r/Conservative ?
t1_dv1ba19	0	*	Free of legal repercussions... which she is facing 
t1_dv0m7gm	0	*	Shes being charged the same as if you made threats to bomb a school in America. There are limits on what you can say.
t1_dv0x6bb	1	*	Yeah, look at what happened to the galactic republic.
t1_dv0r232	0	*	Obviously. Just because something is better than something even worse doesn't mean it's good. 
t1_dv0ylae	0	*	Why open your mouth to talk about shit you clearly know shitall about? The emergency measures are here to protect us from  the backlash created by the American government fucking up Iraq. 
t1_dv13hfb	0	*	If cops can arrest you and then you have to go to court to get the charges dropped is that still freedom of speech?
t1_dv0vfj1	0	*	I'm not calling for gun violence. I'm just calling your bluff. Owning a gun doesn't protect us against government tyranny or whatever. 
t1_dv1g4n4	0	*	I'm sorry europe doesn't have free speech. No American has ever been indicted on twitter for posting pictures.
t1_dv0yay2	1	*	r/watchpeopledie is a nice example since it isnt accessible in Germany for instance. All we get to see is [this](https://imgur.com/58SngeR), which isnt the worst thing.
t1_dv1ay2q	0	*	Well yeah I mean obviously /r/The_Donald posters and Russian bots will argue about whether aiding ISIS is good or bad. /u/BartWellingtonson is at least one of the two.
t1_dv0s7x9	1	*	Because edgelords!
t1_dv1b68w	0	*	hey. I'm not comment ing on sentencing. I just understand why this law would be in place.
t1_dv2ciqo	1	*	Wouldn't know, but it's true that I really disagree with Nazis.
t1_dv15ws8	0	*	The government once killed a 16 year old US citizen with a drone, is your AR gonna protect you from a Hellfire missile?
t1_dv0l470	0	*	By your logic, traffic violations mean you're facing jail time... even for  a parking violation.
t1_dv1s3h7	0	*	Yup!  Now if people believe you and start a stampede that gets people hurt you'll be held responsible, but if everyone just ignores you you can't be prosecuted.
t1_dv257m7	1	*	What's your source for that number ?
t1_dv1pm6q	1	*	No, I am right.  I'm not saying every republican is a bigot, but I don't see what the problem is with calling racists racist. 
t1_dv18pvs	0	*	look at his post history and tell me you aren't surprised. Kathy's joke insulted his god emperor
t1_dv0q5nv	0	*	Lol you cant actually be serious.
t1_dv15lir	0	*	But SUPER unlikely. 
t1_dv0uztm	1	*	Very edgy, very alt right :)
t1_dv1he39	0	*	And those 3 million are going to be super gung ho about killing their friends and family.  I'm sure the entire army would be filled to the brim with will to fight.
t1_dv1gklz	0	*	No one said there weren't restrictions on freedom of speech in the U.S. The point is that there are just way fewer restrictions than any other country in the world.
t1_dv2bwek	1	*	yes it is, go look at a few different dictionaries, the same words will have different definitions 
t1_dv0o2e9	0	*	Oh right. We're on Reddit, where every case of comparison/contrast gets pigeon-holed into being whataboutism.      
t1_dv0n27t	1	*	Since people were comparing her party to ISIS I think they did need reminding, yes.
t1_dv1p2eh	0	*	she couldve made the point with words and instead chose to break a clear law. Let the punishment begin!
t1_dv3khv2	1	*	I'm pretty sure can judging by where I get my porn from
t1_dv1xajv	1	*	We can even show that, but the free market demands we dont. 
t1_dv1neq0	0	*	A party that has direct link with Nazis and only recently changed their stance on the existence of the holocaust is pretty damn close to being extremist. 
t1_dv0zvo3	0	*	And just two hours ago you said censoring violent imagery from children is stupid.  Make up your mind.
t1_dv1gg1v	1	*	Bingo.
t1_dv170jq	0	*	Then why would someone say she was as bad as ISIS if they know how truely awful ISIS was
t1_dv15fmm	1	*	They have a slightly different experience with absolute free speech that for some reason we as Americans dont seem to remember in the same way.
t1_dv0wzcm	0	*	I dont need to see what child pornographers are doing either. Should isis propaganda images be outlawed? cuz thats where that photo came from.
t1_dv0wn51	0	*	Except the person doing so got their Youtube career basically chopped to pieces for doing so...  Also, let's not make psychopath behavior acceptable.
t1_dv1alnu	1	*	No.
t1_dv1tcfh	1	*	Yes, like Oregon and certain parts of California. 
t1_dv0ny8c	1	*	Oh, I 100% agree with you. But unfortunately people make up their minds on headlines more often than not.
t1_dv15v8c	1	*	sure.
t1_dv161y0	0	*	oh
t1_dv0w0q1	1	*	If America is almost half, what word could you use to describe the other half? It starts with M and ends with ajority.
t1_dv0ys79	1	*	Didn't really read what he wrote, did you?
t1_dv0k13o	0	*	>my definition, however, is correct. Wikipedia says  What a trusted source. You're definitely correct
t1_dv15f7j	1	*	When you ignore the core point of an argument and resort to a Reductio ad Hitlerum Fallacy, you might want to reevaluate your position.
t1_dv2ddpn	1	*	No, they aren't. The prosecuters knows very well that there is zero chance for it to result in prison and they are certainly not pushing for it.
t1_dv2746m	1	*	Nice theory you have but not convincing 
t1_dv10e0g	1	*	Morbid curiosity =/= having a death fetish.  Now, if someone were to religiously watch every post on that sub for months on end, that might be another matter.
t1_dv1w40t	0	*	Ah yes a time before tanks, drones, missiles, machineguns, RPGs, fighter jets and nukes. 
t1_dv0vqqj	0	*	Who gets to decide in what situations certain speech is permitted? Who is this neutral arbiter of news value? 
t1_dv0zssx	1	*	You're from an alternate timeline? Tell me more about yours.
t1_dv1qrur	1	*	Doesn't matter, she's French and the conduct (the act of tweeting from her computer/phone) occurred in France.  France has jurisdiction over her.  That's how it works everywhere.
t1_dv2inim	1	*	In the three comments below, I already addressed that very issue, and Im not gonna repeat myself a 5th time.
t1_dv15vwg	1	*	As an American it greatly worries me when people want us to be more like Europe without looking at the bad things that go along with giving the state full control over every aspect of their lives 
t1_dv1br1e	0	*	You're threatening someone at that point which is not equal to what she did
t1_dv0zvr0	0	*	Maybe you live in a country where broadcasting terrorist propaganda is legal, but France isn't one of those. That's just the way it is. 
t1_dv0vyty	1	*	lol. There really isnt that much out there in usa. I mean theres fake gore but not much in the way of crazy weird shit. I at least dont run into that stuff much.
t1_dv0wv3y	0	*	Silencing political opponets this way never goes well. There is a lengthy back story as to why shes being nailed for this.
t1_dv19tcl	1	*	Oh I know, im of the opinion that thats authoritarian.
t1_dv171gb	1	*	Sexual images are protected speech. 
t1_dv0wgq8	0	*	When people start posting shit like that on my facebook, or whispering links on reddit I'd be pissed.
t1_dv0y4lg	1	*	Spreading ISIS propaganda is not.
t1_dv0u3h1	0	*	> Why?  https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2017/04/170411085742.htm
t1_dv1casy	1	*	I feel the same way to a point where it becomes obscene. Threats are in same category and we draw a line there. There are exceptions to all laws, and we as societies can decide what they are.
t1_dtunwi2	0	*	Yes, but the Saturn V was a much larger rocket physically and was entirely expendable. We recovered 2/3 of the main rocket boosters on the first ever launch.
t1_dtuyp2o	0	*	Elon himself said that it looks too real in the press conference. Apparently colors look more crisp in space due to the lack of atmosphere.
t1_dtukc6l	0	*	The US used to blow up atomic bombs over the heads of their soldiers. A drone ship parked a mile away with a camera stapled to the mast is not exactly a dicey risk.
t1_dtujtuq	0	*	They just put a car into orbit, I bet they could put a camera on an unmanned floating platform
t1_dtuo8k8	0	*	it's like that all over the world
t1_dtuo8a0	1	*	That's still pretty damn close, considering. 
t1_dtup5nt	0	*	Gimme a gold and you got it  Edit: thank you sir. You shall be given the movie rights.  Now then to figure out what people use gold for since this is my first one.
t1_dtvh4je	1	*	I thought this was maybe going to happen in a couple of years or so, wake up and we have a fucking sports cabriolet twirling around in space.   Wtf. Go Humans!
t1_dtunuzr	1	*	Jesus thats depressing. Dont worry rover we'll be there soon
t1_dtv1oug	1	*	Well, that Flat Earth guy is trying to launch a steam rocket.  Wait til his co-loons learn that he could have just driven a car instead.
t1_dtv1m7v	1	*	Droneship wasn't destroyed, just had 2 engines damaged. It'll probably have to be towed back to port. 
t1_dtvaa1p	0	*	> It was obsolete by the time it was deployed.  What makes something like that obsolete? In terms of speed or capability? 
t1_dtv2lu6	1	*	For a low flat rate
t1_dtvkwuq	1	*	Damn those are some smart engineers :)
t1_dtuwx8l	0	*	Who the fuck eats pizza rolls for breakfast?    Also I'm sorry I insulted your god, by mentioning that there is a religion which worships him.  
t1_dtugwjm	1	*	Proof of concept that the rocket could send a similar payload to mars, even if this was just a test flight.
t1_dtusk7y	0	*	\>tfw trees don't have basements. 
t1_dtvamjj	0	*	He probably had some help though.
t1_dtvamk2	0	*	Nope
t1_dtug1ye	1	*	Chances of failure were deemed too high to risk any valuable payload. Other than that, it's a better PR stunt than any other *useless* payload (such as sand bags).
t1_dtuszy9	0	*	If you consider the shuttle a success you must think the falcon 9 is a miracle.
t1_dtvyfpl	0	*	Fair enough.  My point was more along the lines of the truly mind blowing concepts, inventions, and achievements happening decades ago.  This event just seems like rounding error on top of thise.
t1_dtv36z0	1	*	Deal!
t1_dtuzic8	1	*	CGI!!!!

t1_dvsw76s	1	*	Thanks for that link, I appreciate it.   I'm not one to defend any one model, so you're jumping to conclusions if you're calling me a globe believer. I prefer to point out issues.
t1_dtuyfms	1	*	I'll write the credits.

t1_dtutcph	1	*	I mean considering the last 20 or so new rockets worked flawlessly yeah it kinda is. Theres much more unkown when it comes to used boosters than new ones.

t1_dtuuxfi	0	*	Did he just say their total investment was half a billion? Thats IT?! Surely I misheard him, how has no one done this before?
t1_dtviwtc	1	*	Thank you for your insightful comments as well. The thread about rocket ships and space exploration really needed some valuable input from people who believe in magic.

t1_dscgvwh	0	*	What?  Of course they are.  Im just careful about not broadcasting sensitive material over email.  You have to assume that info is available for anybody who cares enough to find it.

t1_dsi06w2	0	*	> An argument is said to be fallacious when the conclusion doesn't logically follow from the premises.  No. That'd be a non-sequitur, merely one type of fallacy. 
t1_dshy9oc	0	*	Im sure. I was just pointing out Dastayari was not government. The LNP have their fair share of corruption with Murdoch/NBN. 
t1_dsjbyvx	0	*	We could try to vote out all the incumbents. Maybe give that a shot before we skip to the shooting?

t1_dsi1l20	0	*	Not sure what side you're on here but I think the US needs to be punished for doing it if they are trying to punish someone else.
t1_dsic97t	1	*	17 minutes.  I find it very helpful to unwrap logical fallacies by role playing. I also roll my boogers and flick them into the ether.
t1_dshv3sg	0	*	Cultural differences are kind of hard to quantify. Meeting and talking to people is probably a better way to find out about them than looking at statistics.
t1_dshycpw	0	*	Robots.  Soon the only paths to our survival will be socialism (with its admittedly poor rate of success) or luddism (with a much worse one). Hopefully people figure this out soon enough.

t1_dsihiwx	1	*	>  You fail to realise  I hate when people say that.  Especially teenagers.

t1_dshxgmq	1	*	Ricardo? Montalbxe1n?
t1_dsi0x5r	0	*	That defeats the purpose of sarcasm. It's not even really sarcasm if you explain that you're being sarcastic.
t1_dsi0320	0	*	Well I think most commanders would happily risk court martial over not nuking London. For NK, it's much less certain.
t1_dshran9	1	*	workers revolution = communism communism + anything = millions dead 
t1_dshvutl	0	*	Thats why i said russia is worse in the political system. Doesnt make the US sytem any better though. People need to stop justifying one sides actions and shortcomings by saying the other is worse
t1_dsisq8e	0	*	I certainly don't like any kind of corruption, but I am most upset about this because I think Putin is trying to undermine Western democracy, which I value pretty highly.
t1_dshwthe	0	*	It sounds like you are agreeing with me. The user isn't trying to discredit the evidence of russian interference, so it isn't whataboutism.

t1_dshrc9u	0	*	A system that rewards greed and ideally goes unchecked, where could we go wrong worshipping that?
t1_dshsqcy	0	*	I think it's almost silly to compare the neo nazis of Eastern Europe to the US. Just look at the Ukraine that shit is absurd 
t1_dshswui	1	*	The politicians are the *real* prostitutes.

t1_dsjc3sg	1	*	Yes. 
t1_dslqg7p	1	*	Yea ok, almost any country in Europe other than my own should be more alien than another US state to an American, that's no comparison :p

t1_dshzst6	0	*	I didnt ask questions, Ive only met him once and it was a really weird experience. He lives in Michigan now so thats probably why hes still kicking
t1_dshvgz8	1	*	Don't forget the HAHAHA bit
t1_dsi89s9	1	*	Cubas problem is that it was a Soviet satellite state for 40 years.  Nothing is better than the modern American left that still doesnt see the damage done to Cuba by the USSR.

t1_dsdpvkf	0	*	Finally, genius, this date for the Micronova agrees perfectly with the Piorra Oscillation that Geo climatologists have discovered for the rapid desertification of the Sahara.. Get a clue skooby doo.
t1_dsdwyqk	0	*	Once again, please show me the peer-reviewed astronomical publications that talk about planet Rahab this micronova. This should be easy if it is on the Akkadian Seal (did Sargon put it there?)  
t1_dshrt9o	0	*	So the US didn't occupy Iraq?  Think for at least 5 seconds, about how impossible it is to war a country and then install your preferred government in place, without having to occupy the country.
t1_dsa7s6j	1	*	That's false. Democracy and civil liberties are very important chapters to join the EU (even if you can go back on those once you have joined).
t1_ds9qd57	1	*	Oh all right.
t1_dsa20uj	1	*	I agree on that, it is not the same situation but the problem is if we don't stop Poland now, you will have a dictatorship soon too, with all the consequences.
t1_ds9ud9p	0	*	> Poland and Hungary did comply, at least for a while. That's the trick.  that's the problem, yes. we need to sanction them or kick them out, otherwise the entry check becomes a farce.

t1_dss441w	0	*	Nowhere in the MI5 report does it say that there is no link between religiosity and terrorism. Lack of scholarly education in a religion does not mean absence of belief in said religion. 
t1_dss6kge	1	*	Then why do they kill people who disrespect the pedophile Muhammad? 
t1_dssblkk	0	*	What was he trying to accomplish? Was he just attacking people for being a part of a different sect of islam? 
t1_dsul4cs	1	*	Because I'm not American and I'm not talking about America, Just because America does it  doesn't make it right. Quite the opposite actually.
t1_dsrts9q	0	*	He made a negative assumption without any sort of evidence which is why I am calling him a troll. There is no sound reason to think that the majority of clerics do not agree.
t1_dsro7jk	0	*	It also gives them a reason to chop off your head with a dull knife. Religious extremists don't like their world view being questioned. 
t1_dsspq53	0	*	>civilians  Kaffir.

t1_dsttsb0	0	*	Except you're the one who's taken it upon yourself to decide what's legitimate criticism and what's bigotry, and you've clearly got a bias in favor of Islam and religion in general.

t1_dtcostx	0	*	Yes, but he isn't Stalin. There would be no way to hide the fact he is killing these people.
t1_dtcu94z	0	*	Anyway, he didn't secretly support gay marriage.  That's a liberal fantasy cooked up to zealously support obama regardless of the shitty evil and awful things he's done.

t1_du49twy	0	*	Yep! But the rest of us don't get hurricanes, so we get away with it most days. It's a much worse plan if your island gets hurricanes.

t1_du493gc	0	*	You have been to how many of the 1000 islands? How the Bahamas recovers depends on which island.  The Bahamas is an offshore haven for tax evaders and hedge funds. There is plenty of money there.

t1_duhplt1	0	*	And one would be wrong.
t1_duhwmwi	1	*	Only problem with your statements is that they could be seen as what was developing in spite of religion, not because of it.
t1_dul7z8w	1	*	I wouldn't preach it to anyone.  Im not Christian.  So...there is that.
t1_duhppy9	0	*	Because other scientists and thinkers around the same time didn't receive the same approach as Galileo. 
t1_duiabed	0	*	Your back tracking from your original uninformed attacks on Christianity is palpable. Try responding to all the points he brought up in that post (such as Jesus' sacrifice).
t1_duie4o5	0	*	That's a pretty good source. I'm surprised to see that and dissapointed with the church. I would think it would be everyone's responsibility to report abuse.

t1_ds4r1sz	0	*	Liberals arent really butthurt about anyone criticizing the country these days. We should be criticized, our government is embarrasing.

t1_ds4pg61	1	*	Are we just going to keep answering questions with other questions? 
t1_ds57nrm	1	*	I'm sorry I should have said most of an entire country. Such a grievous misrepresentation. So you can only read the minds of most of an entire country.

t1_ds4qb7l	1	*	Or Collagen
t1_ds4w66g	1	*	That isn't unusual.  Scripts and books containing DoD references have to be checked by the DoD to verify they don't include classified references.

t1_ds4rb1s	1	*	A note on that ruling: NY is weird and the Supreme Court is actually the lowest criminal court in the state. Im not sure if there was an appeal filed.
t1_ds4ry3l	0	*	You can't really speculate about who those nonvoters supported. White people voted overwhelmingly for a child molesting bigot and it should be troubling.
t1_ds5a44b	0	*	If I were you I would use /s. Imo it's common sense because sarcasm is usually conveyed through your tone of voice but you can't do that in text.

t1_ds534do	0	*	Well I still feel bad for her, but there goes a whole lotta sympathy for the movement.
t1_ds6uzfa	0	*	Then your society has a lot of issues again if Russian influence is that bad. And I'd like to note people don't complain when oh Israel or France or Britain shill for one side in domestic US politics.
t1_ds4sxq3	1	*	It is absolutely about deflection.  We can (and probably should) have a conversation about how the US handles its own democratic protests.  But that conversation is separate from the one about Iran.
t1_ds4p85n	0	*	because socialism is a bad thing? is that what you're saying?
t1_ds4s2jr	0	*	Only the ones who don't know how to use proxies.

t1_dts2mdr	0	*	Today is an arbitrary point in history.
t1_ds3urd3	0	*	No it's not. Corporate influence is real, but the voter is still very much the Sovereign. If Trump is good for anything it's for proving that.

t1_dt6k4de	0	*	Intelligence isnt in sync on it though. Their is no empirical truth to the matter yet. Hence the Mueller investigation.
t1_dt6e625	1	*	https://youtu.be/N0IWe11RWOM
t1_dt5uuef	0	*	Exactly my point.   Anything that confirms this bias is going to be treated as truth, anything which goes counter to this bias is going to be viewed as propaganda likely spread by Russian bots. 
t1_dt5v294	0	*	Trump has been pressuring him to fire Mueller for months now and he is refusing. I think he is holding firm for now.

t1_dt6nnp2	0	*	I think the goal is to drum up public support so they can vote for its release. But I just saw a report that vote could happen next week sooo...but yes, GET ON WITH IT!
t1_dt5v3ff	0	*	Clearly. Your powers of observation are so astute you should join the Mueller team.

t1_dt5tvkd	0	*	> obviously you know better than almost every single intelligence agency.  I would be upset if I didn't know more than they do. Why haven't they released a single shred of hard evidence?
t1_dt5vpto	0	*	This is the mindset of everybody who doesn't care about innocence, rule of law, or the constitution. It's sickening that you want to coup a democratically elected president by any means necessary.

t1_dt5ym9s	0	*	I've used that argument before. Favorite response was I don't care how long he's been with the GOP, as long as he's with the GOP. So what if Obama suddenly changed parties? Then he's lying.
t1_dt5wuqp	0	*	Are you going to tell us about MK Ultra now? I'm sipping my morning coffee, and I love a good show in the morning
t1_dt7qm56	0	*	The reason there is no definitive evidence available to you and I, is because the investigation is still ongoing and they haven't come to a conclusion yet.

t1_dt6pvn3	1	*	Of course they didn't. Did you see how Trump dismantled Jeb Bush during the debates? Also Clinton was a bigger fan of Bush's war than Trump was.
t1_dt5yt39	0	*	Exactly. It was their election to lose and the DNC fucked it up royally by putting up the worst possible candidate in history. Biden would have put up a better race even.
t1_dt5vffc	0	*	What kind of BS response is that? Joe Scarborough is another example. Ill give mueller the benefit of the doubt but Comey is a hack, only a republican for perception

t1_dt5v89m	0	*	I heard he is a by-the-book guy. He appointed Mueller, would be really weird if he ignored his report.

t1_dt61q7p	0	*	Lol.  Our anthem is still better and every time I sing it, I still get the shivers.
t1_dt62fsy	1	*	When campaign reform is enacted and we move away from first past the post voting that locks us into a two party system. 
t1_dt6d3lh	1	*	You mean you blame the voters for overwhelmingly electing Clinton?
t1_dt5wx0m	1	*	I think where is no such a state in this world that would tolerate this.

t1_dt9kksa	1	*	Caligula ruined it for everyone by rigging his horse's victory.
t1_dt5wrl5	1	*	Ehh.. Cali gives drivers licenses to illegal immigrants (see the Uber Rapist in yesterday's news) so this isn't too big of a deal
t1_dt64v9o	1	*	Yes, and the president has the ability to declassify those documents. thats my whole point

t1_dt6y1ba	0	*	Basically if Assange is a tool because Russia is using him, then Russia is also a tool because Assange is using them for exposure/publishing due to being blackballed by the west
t1_dt6dqn3	1	*	Sure, if you can get him under oath then you can ask him all sorts of stuff to see if he lies about it.
t1_dt61wgx	0	*	But if it doesn't get released, you understand that's because Nunes didn't want it to, right? 
t1_dt61lkc	1	*	We don't. But I have seen nothing to suggest he is.   It's pretty obvious who has what agenda in washington but Mueller seems to be only interested in doing his job.  
t1_dt6aty4	0	*	The really scary part is that Trump's ego won't let him admit this to himself or anyone else. And this will help it continue much longer.
t1_dt605vc	1	*	Trump's previous career was as a New York City real estate developer. You have to donate to Democratic politicians, their politcal machine controls that city and state, to get approval for projects.
t1_dt61l7q	0	*	Perhaps you should contact your local newspaper, or the major ones. You can remain anonymous and still get the word out.
t1_dt6iks5	1	*	You are adorable :) I just realized that you didn't know what the world intelligible means, that's pretty funny!

t1_dt5y88t	1	*	Never
t1_dt71oid	0	*	Sure, maybe you should read a paper about it instead of believing what you were told. 
t1_dt80jg2	0	*	The report was never written to actually be read. You won't read it and neither will I. It was written to be talked about on Fox News. To sow the seeds of doubt of the Mueller investigation. 
t1_dt80lps	0	*	Haha totally classic. Like I replied to you in another comment, the report will not be read. It's filled with classified information. He won't even let the Senate Intelligence Committee read it.
t1_dt5vp7w	0	*	If Trump gets reelected in 2020 i will eat a deep fried sock and post a video on youtube.
t1_dt5x69m	1	*	Agreed. Those can be both internal and external however.

t1_dt5zifs	0	*	Boomers are in their 60s. What do you mean?
t1_dt6gnu5	0	*	Yes. That's absolutely correct. It broke the communist government by building a wall to keep the people inside. It's apples to oranges here.  Trump is trying to keep the people out. 
t1_dt6bgvf	0	*	it's not war because congress hasn't voted on, and passed a declaration of war against the other country. The constitution has a pretty clear cut definition of the term war. 
t1_dt6gcxf	1	*	Yeah, but the Democrats play [even dirtier](https://theintercept.com/2018/01/23/dccc-democratic-primaries-congress-progressives/) in local elections.
t1_dt5y5mk	1	*	Comey and Mueller are part of the Clinton deep state who want to take down Trump, that is what Fox news says.
t1_dt5xait	1	*	I am unqualified to answer that question, sorry. 
t1_dt5uqxu	1	*	Yep. A guy on his side, so there's nothing to worry about.

t1_dsgsvkz	0	*	The preservation of human dignity is the most important right in the German constitution and Holocaust denial is considered to violate the dignity of the Holocaust victims.
t1_dsxjy1s	0	*	And that's exactly my point. It's all part of the game. Don't know why I get downvoted for stating facts. People just get uncomfortable when you call it what it is. 
t1_dsxunti	0	*	And you feel that's different than having sales tax included in the cost of goods?
t1_dsxucwr	0	*	I'm glad you have conceded.
t1_dsk63r8	0	*	Competition for low skilled jobs keeps wages lower.  It's only when employers are unable to find good people for the pay offering that they resort to increasing it slightly.
t1_dtv0yoy	1	*	For now...
t1_dtv6oak	1	*	Yes that could complicate things (tax) if you cashout in the usa.
t1_dsv0c2l	0	*	Higher levels of education lead to a higher level of production. It also leads to higher wages, which creates a higher demand for quality goods that can now be afforded. 
t1_dsv2s3y	0	*	Plenty of poor ish countries that have those social benefits.
t1_dsv4g56	0	*	Jesus Christ, I started on 27 and I get an extra day each year to start with, then an extra day every two years after a certain point. People who have worked here a while have 40+ days. 
t1_dstz0nn	1	*	No, he's right. Republicans are all pretty standard but the left is all over the place here. 
t1_dsuahog	0	*	Places in the UK, at least where I've worked, get annoyed if you don't use a large enough portion of your time off.
t1_dstpnwd	1	*	Fuck yeah!
t1_dsudecn	1	*	It's 28 days in the UK, up to the employer if they include public holidays in that entitlement.
t1_dstn1e3	0	*	You'd be hard pressed to argue that they don't at least get the equivalent of 2-3 weeks vacation
t1_dstqi7a	0	*	Ok, it s usual in Germany that you don t use free days in the first 6 months. However, ofc you earn them and use them afterwards.
t1_dstoyti	0	*	>They also spend a lot of time working over some of those breaks though so they aren't actually just off  well, they get paid if they work in summer/winter vacations
t1_dt3xail	0	*	When you're relocating people of a certain ethnic group who don't want to be relocated under the threat of death, the accurate wording is ethnic cleansing.
t1_dv498j6	0	*	Afghanistan is definitely not a good example of Russian moral superiority.
t1_dv484zd	0	*	Russia is the agressor here and is basically attacking Nato here. Nato needs to react in kind

t1_dv483w6	1	*	Bullshit. 
t1_dv4c1jv	1	*	Sorry, that was poor wording. I didn't mean to imply that, and I'll edit it out.  Shit, most of Stalin's victims were Russians.
t1_dv46142	0	*	I dont give a flying fuck. This was about Ukraine not any other country. You can stick your attempts to complicate the argument right up your self deprecating ring piece. 
t1_dv48jeb	1	*	Yes, I agree your argument is dumb and fallacious.

t1_dv47l0p	1	*	You are not actively bombing/striking/etc. Assad's troops lol. Where did you get this misconception.
t1_dv3zm94	0	*	No. China and Russia killed those people using communist framework. You don't a get a pass for a change of political structure. 
t1_dv451bd	1	*	Are you kidding? An estimated 22 million Russians died at the hands of Stalin. 30-50 for Mao. 8-15 for Lenin. 
t1_dv65dkk	0	*	In a nutshell: Our propaganda good, theirs bad.  Edit: Why do you call it Bush era propaganda? A weak attempt to make it look as if it isn't happening today anymore?

t1_du30635	1	*	Like everybody wlae is aaying, it's implied in the article that they mean Muslim fasting, especially because a hijab ban is also mentioned.
t1_du4e50j	1	*	But you are advocating forcing them NOT to do it yourselves. That's what I wanted to point out. I think the position of the school should be neutral towards such matters.
t1_du3cm82	1	*	And I think that's the entire point, school will still be in, so it was a recommendation to not have your kids fasting for 15 hours a day.
t1_du2l45p	0	*	This isn't true. Teenage circadian rhythms are different from adult and pre-pubescent children. Of course, some can just go to bed early, but that's actually very untrue at the population level.

t1_dsc2cfg	0	*	I think you are not quite understanding my comment.  Perhaps you should reread and think a little harder before trying to insult others, because you are sounding like a jackass.  Thanks.
t1_dsb4bmj	0	*	So is this like a novelty account where you pretend to act like a Russian bot but don't say the things the real ones are saying? Cus dat username tho. 
t1_dsbov4t	0	*	I linked 4 seperate sites proving my point. Sticking to 1 of them while ignoring the other 3 is just shilling at its finest. The numbers are there.
t1_dsbar81	0	*	He's saying it's a shit sentence. It makes no sense grammatically. That's what the wut. is for. 
t1_dsbl30m	1	*	And this was in some way relevant to what i said? 
t1_dsb2xwc	0	*	Posting on T_D means you automatically lose arguments on any other sub, dont you know anything?
t1_dsb0fqa	0	*	Every new child is a potential consumer and future debt holder! It'd be an affront to society to not encourage the propagation of new target groups.
t1_dsbrfri	1	*	The EU only taxes certain people sending money to their original country?
t1_dsb3rax	1	*	I'm glad trump ended that program, regardless
t1_dsb3t1a	1	*	Wouldn't you want them to take the basic economics course first?  Or is this more Trumpian logic on display?
t1_dsbctb8	1	*	Just the free market bits and tariffs that empower national corps, who are the better US citizen.   I wonder if this all comes down to a low self steem problem among the Trumpists.

t1_dsb4pon	0	*	The whole wall is expensive. Thats why Mexico is going to pay for it. U0001f609
t1_dsbl2zt	0	*	The later.  We spend a great deal of money on both education and healthcare and we should expect better results.  Why we aren't getting better results is what we should be pushing.
t1_dsb6j2q	1	*	Why?
t1_dsbzg3h	0	*	>The number of people it will stop would be in the hundreds at best.  I can't even take that seriously. How old are you?
t1_dsbbwja	1	*	If he dies, things will get much worse. Being a leftist will become a crime.
t1_dsb41qg	1	*	Lol no because the most damage that can be done is just letting him stay in power
t1_dsbr170	0	*	Who Greg's the Greg?

t1_dsc6960	1	*	Dem obstruction!!! 
t1_dsb7ndw	0	*	Guns? Doesn't apply. When he wants to talk about illegal aliens, fine, he was talking about guns
t1_dujejmh	0	*	Im coming in specifically to answer a question. Most treason convictions end in clemency and pardons. You dont have to be condescending, Im just trying to answer your question. 
t1_dukshgf	1	*	Ah, the old it's all shit, believe me. Just say #MAGA #FAKENEWS and save yourself the time.
t1_duk6t1q	0	*	I just wanted him to respond and now that you have he almost certainly won't. No fun at all. Ah well. Just bored I suppose.
t1_dux1h74	1	*	I don't doubt that it does happen, but I'm not certain it happens in large enough numbers that the legality of it would make much of a difference.
t1_duxa711	0	*	Well you said Trudeau should be revolting to the left. But decriminalizing drugs seems like something they would like.
t1_duytwlx	0	*	>yeah let's decriminalize that.  That was a snarky comment. Everyone knows what you mean't by it.
t1_ducmrbf	1	*	There's a possibility aliens come and kidnap Kim Jong Un as well, but I don't think we should base our foreign policy on such absurd theories.
t1_dv2g6vj	1	*	But a decimal is not a decimal numeral? One is a noun, the other 'decimal' here is an adjective.
t1_dtc6equ	1	*	To be fair, his response was in regards to Canada's current policy regarding the North, not what our policy was during the cold war. 
t1_dtxdofn	0	*	Can we stop acting like the whole entire country would emigrate there are still plenty of Estonians in Estonia despite it being very poor and very close to some of the richest countries in the world.

t1_dtxuxxt	1	*	>Mexicans presumably need a visa and have to go through a lot of red tape to move to the US?  To put it mildly.
t1_dtxf7wv	0	*	I would like it but I think economy also comes into play. Also isnt English still a minority language. I thought Afrikaans and Xhosa (I think) are bigger. Also the Queen isnt the head of state.
t1_dtxdazt	0	*	Lizzie wasn't on the throne at that point in time, unless you are talking about Vicki.
t1_dtxghzf	0	*	You sure? Im pretty sure its chicken tikka masala.   I guess where Im off is that its Englands national dish not the whole entire United Kingdom. 
t1_dtxdjqt	0	*	Whistler is already australian
t1_dtxcemm	0	*	Why though? Is there a reason behind this -or did a bunch of people from China go 'Let's go to British Columbia!'
t1_dtxoaee	1	*	Yeah, that's the problem, me commenting on reality.  My point stands.
t1_dtxdj82	0	*	Sounds like something a North American would do.  Of course theyre different from each other. Different languages, culture, food, music, art, history, accents blah blah blah
t1_dtxf90a	0	*	Well integrated doesn't mean culturally closer. Heck Poland and the UK are on the same continent...

t1_dtxo1x0	1	*	Morally, we should be giving them free travel. But yes, I should have fact checked that!
t1_dtxesm4	0	*	Five Eyes is literally surveillance on the citizens, I don't know why you wouldn't think it wouldn't facilitate travel
t1_dtxew10	0	*	Good god, that can never happen!
t1_du25nf8	1	*	Switzerland, IIRC. 
t1_dtxhstj	1	*	The problem isn't immigrants taking $10/hour shit jobs no-one wants to do.  It becomes a problem when they're taking $40/hour jobs because they're willing to do them for $25.
t1_dtxd5lx	0	*	Pretty sure John Adams just rolled over in his grave.
t1_dtxdumn	0	*	The old English racists are more accepting of Indians but I don't know about he young skinhead type racists

t1_dtyw6ld	1	*	Here in the states we call those fuckbuddies.
t1_dtxef1i	0	*	Polish is spoken more in Ireland than Irish is at this point.  The Poles and Irish love each other though. 
t1_dtxcizw	1	*	Scratch that, Russia is 45th. Some light fingered Google research ranks Germany at approximately 176 countries. 
t1_dtxdhb3	0	*	The xenophobia towards poles in the UK is vastly overstated. Culturally brits and poles aren't too far apart. 
t1_dtxgd8n	1	*	What do you call the river that separates China from India?   The Fraser.
t1_dtxdrus	0	*	You forgot to mention that some of your best friends are black
t1_dtxf0lk	1	*	South African English is a minority L1 language in its own country. If the rubric is any country that uses English as a lingua franca then half the world would be eligible
t1_dtxeson	0	*	And they said Brexit would give us a shortage of people for jobs the British look down at. When he closes a door, he opens a flood gate. 
t1_dtxm98v	0	*	And you said the flow of people is southward which is not true. Also Illegal US to Canada border crossings are at an all time high. 
t1_dtxh320	0	*	> minimum wage   > go on holiday  Can I use your accountant please?

t1_dtximdv	0	*	2 people per language?
t1_dtxdezt	0	*	They're new.  Until recently we did not have many Polish people here, now we do.  It's easy to blame the new people from a different place.
t1_dtxt2ar	1	*	... If he's a Kiwi he's probably closer ideologically to Trudeau than he is you.
t1_dtxeg4o	1	*	That's just Melbourne. Sydney has other racial issues, but the Sudanese are very brazen in Melbourne...
t1_dty7mk4	1	*	I wasn't comparing. Seemed like OP was trotting out a version of white people have no culture
t1_dtxp4we	1	*	Sadly, his brother is still around spouting hot air.

t1_dtxevx4	0	*	Well we still have it much better than most countries, comparing to resource rich countries like australia and norway then ofc it looks bad.
t1_dtxdgs5	0	*	Because a good majority of them are drunks and rude as hell. I've had polish neighbours - All of them have been loud, drunk and rude. 
t1_dtxa71e	1	*	Damn right son...git gud or git dead.  Much like the Romans, the Ottomans and every other advanced civilisation.
t1_dtxfh04	0	*	And Australia, Canada, and New Zealand.
t1_dtyp8xo	1	*	You know queening is facesitting, right?
t1_dtx9q3x	1	*	Lol, Earl's Court? bred for barwork..  It's true though, I know a ton of people spent time in the UK though nearly all of them came home after their visas were up. 
t1_dtxkbyz	1	*	Exactly, she has powers, but they aren't used and are slowly being phased out. 
t1_dtxf03j	0	*	You had higher numbers of Poles, Russians, Czechs, Jews, Irish etc in the immediate postwar period which didn't cause the same level of angst as now. 
t1_dtysmfn	1	*	I'm not a bigot, but you are.
t1_dtxgehw	0	*	Coka cola is cheaper in australia.  
t1_dtxfs0g	1	*	I think there isn't the same cultural link with south Africa that he was talking about. English came into play there separately 
t1_dtxc4e5	1	*	No, no excuses. I'm not from US and even I know this. Like I said, basic stuff
t1_dtxhit3	0	*	>That one never shows up in the history books.  Yeah, because there's no proof the famine was deliberately orchestrated and the only people who claim otherwise have an agenda.
t1_dtyejy1	1	*	Cool thanks! 
t1_dtxwywm	1	*	Right, I was just making a comparison. Like they are both UK but I felt more culturally similar to Scottish and Irish people than English. 
t1_dtxx4ae	1	*	This was 3-4 years ago, but i doubt it.
t1_dtyd9j6	1	*	Disclaimer: This is a good thing.  The upside-down crowd can pull a mean shot.
t1_dtxprou	1	*	Nah, the only white people in Van are the ones selling the dope, the rest are Chinese and Indians. It is nice there.
t1_dtxo8bg	0	*	Clear incompetence? Are you referring to the Brexit? That was a fault of the people not the government, they were just being democratic. 
t1_dtxk310	1	*	Akhand Bharat v2.exe  Videshi Diwas will be rechristened as Akhand Bharat Diwas
t1_dtykemo	1	*	NO. I am LARPING Dennis Finch http://justshootme.wikia.com/wiki/Dennis_Finch. A male admin asst who works with clueless assholes. 
t1_dtye0la	0	*	You made a false statement on the inter webs. Someone pointed out the statement was false. It's not pedantic. It's just people having a conversation.   
t1_dty2cbm	0	*	Yeah but polish girls make love much more like British lasses than Indian women.
t1_dtxrkyn	1	*	Technically God Save the Queen is the Royal Union Anthem (?).
t1_dtxv8n8	0	*	The rates are crap now. Ten years ago we would get free coffees and donuts about a third of the time. Now it's just ... Meh 
t1_dtxf3mx	1	*	No. The Queen's a joke. We have enough of those here. 
t1_dxolz6q	0	*	All i can say is that your stance is pretty delusional and far from reality. I legit feel sorry for your misplaced ''onspoken'' bound.
t1_dtz4nie	1	*	> Plus the sheer diversity guarantees assimilation  No... it doesn't. Australia, much like other countries with immigrants, has insular groups occupying the same areas. 
t1_dtxfvqx	0	*	Mum's spaghetti
t1_dtxkelj	0	*	your comment seems devoid of anything but spite, disagreeable on every point, you have a baseless hate, just admit it
t1_dtxopfv	1	*	That, and Norwegians pay a lot, having proper [vowels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f488uJAQgmw&t=1m18s) unlike Swedish employers.
t1_dtxdgjw	0	*	Lol what? Humans have spent the overwhelming majority of our history moving freely whenever and wherever it seemed advisable...
t1_dtym6ni	1	*	Thats pretty ignorant 
t1_dtxjjw3	0	*	My smallish city in Canada has about 40+ doctors come from South Africa in the past few years. It is pretty awesome. Surprisingly, everyone I've seen is white.
t1_dtxoyga	1	*	Well thank you for your family coming here, without it Britain would have struggled more to recover. 
t1_dtxgudn	0	*	They meant she can say no to being reinstated as the Queen of India.

t1_dtxme20	0	*	You will also be required to recite God save the queen.
t1_dtxn241	1	*	Jesus...fucking Christ..
t1_dty6f75	1	*	My list was not exhaustive as was implied in my phrasing. Also, an exhaustive list is not relevant to the point that I was making. 
t1_dtxslpf	0	*	You know you can move right? The government won't stop you from relocating.
t1_dtzagsl	1	*	It's all part of the grand plan...   British tea with Canadian maple syrup will help alleviate the symptoms of your stomach cancer. 
t1_dtxe6jh	1	*	He wasn't replying/referring to the article. He was replying to the commenter above him.
t1_dtxg4g6	1	*	Generals Governor
t1_dtxncfh	1	*	Primitive feudal society and a lack of investment in sanitation are not random, unrelated factors.
t1_dtxjjsn	1	*	Sounds exactly like the U.S. and Mexico situation.
t1_dtxdasa	1	*	Yeah but there's a ton of oddities and overlapping treaties involved.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TsXMe8H6iyc scratches the surface a bit.
t1_dty38tr	1	*	Damn polish, taking mexican stereotype from us.   They took der stereotype
t1_dtxeby9	1	*	We can work and drink harder.  Edit: I am NOT from Poland, but Slavic origin.
t1_dtz4mpp	1	*	Haha... got it. My computer froze and I was hitting Post every minute before I realised it
t1_dtxuynl	1	*	To be clear, I was referring to the people you are saying think like that, it seemed like a bit of a broad statement you made, basically putting leavers in the basket of deplorables
t1_dtxlra9	0	*	What's the second one?
t1_dtxky0y	1	*	You just need to be a bit handy at cricket and you're in!
t1_dtxg1ko	0	*	love it, dont forget the pakistanis 
t1_dtxerln	0	*	Well, we've got blistering cold to balance it all out. 
t1_dtzkn01	1	*	You can get away with only speaking French in quite a number of places in Ontario. Many cities are designated as francophone zones. Including Toronto, Hamilton, and the wider Golden Horseshoe.
t1_dtxh4p4	0	*	Not a settler colony though.  Let's be real, that's what it's for. The countries that were actually founded through British imperialism. 
t1_dtxdt5b	1	*	Also, snakes, spiders, and great whites.   At least the hole in the ozone is closing up though, so reduced risk of melanoma. 
t1_dtxeeul	0	*	Because the two things have nothing to do with each other.   You could as easily find another random issue, one where proximity does matter, and use that to prove it also matters for free movement. 
t1_dtxg4ix	0	*	Long live queen.
t1_dtz4nt3	1	*	It's also one of the most liveable cities in the world. The Hong Kong people who moved there, took their education and wealth there. 
t1_dtxpp2v	1	*	And all of us command
t1_dtxl4r9	1	*	It includes athletes from overseas territories too which are UK but not GB. It's bizarre. 
t1_dtxfiyv	0	*	Why wouldn't it? It's called The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for a reason.
t1_dtxvw62	0	*	Which is true, because it's in Canada. However, compared to the rest of Canada, it pales.
t1_dtxkxxf	0	*	It's paraphrased from an email that's been going round since the year 2000 (at least that I'm aware of; probably longer).
t1_dty3q4d	0	*	Who's legal system do you think you are using?
t1_dtxr6z9	1	*	That's not the point. The average Polish person is way closer culturally to a Briton than the average Indian guy. 
t1_dtxk0nh	0	*	If you are into comics K and Clay tells the fictional story of the origin of superhero comics and the push back by the censors.
t1_dtyjxtb	1	*	The Polish tend to ride inside the train carriage.   Just sayin. 
t1_dtxhfdy	0	*	But bc the house prices are insane! 
t1_dsx7vyu	0	*	Republican Southern Strategy says hi. 2018 Republicans are the 1865 Democrats. Accept the facts. 
t1_dswm6xm	0	*	You people are so delusional. So is a seed the same thing as a tree to you too?
t1_dswgtju	0	*	People are fighting to give more rights to the baby. 
t1_dswpdoh	0	*	So if someone tried to kill you, and you had a gun, would you let them kill you, since your life is no more important than theirs?
t1_dswqei2	0	*	what about the non-newborn children? 
t1_dswpdo5	1	*	Glad you agree.
t1_dswqk20	0	*	But alas, they are arbitrary stipulations you impose to define a human as a person or not. This is evil
t1_dsyaqxz	0	*	And when you post in the Anglosphere, you're gonna be talking to Americans who discuss *your* politics from an American point of view. You're gonna have to come to terms with that.
t1_dsx9ozf	0	*	You are never going to be fully aware of just how inconceivably stupid you are 
t1_dsx8tcb	0	*	One side thinks a dude in the clouds will judge women who have abortions. See why their dumbfuck views should be ignored by a state making policies?
t1_dswo8lq	0	*	Principles in parties change both in Canada and America. And in both countries there are only ever two possible winning choices at the voting booth. 
t1_dswucxr	1	*	Thats probably because ethnic usually doesnt refer to white people. They dont seem to be particularly fond of brown babies, as they called them which lends to your assumption. 
t1_dswlq27	0	*	Dinyop. 
t1_dswpc1g	0	*	Yes. The answer is yes. The life of a person is more important than a fetus. 
t1_dswkn8c	0	*	Your link is misleading propaganda, and obvious about it. 
t1_dsxj3vf	0	*	I can't argue with trump logic.
t1_dswpr6u	0	*	>Fetus isnt baby for a long time.  But you acknowledge that it is human, at least then. What is your moral justification for aborting a healthy fetus when the mother isn't in any danger?
t1_dt50gwg	1	*	I misspoke. In France the percentage of people who vote according to their Christian beliefs is the same as the percentage of homosexuals.
t1_dswi688	0	*	Organ donars are not a protected group in Canada. 
t1_dswow71	0	*	You're welcome
t1_dswxfba	0	*	Since the article is about Trudeau, he might just be talking about Canada.
t1_dswl84h	0	*	The point of my comment was that it is not, as you say, that simple.  You did a great job of proving it with your reply, well done.
t1_dswovkr	0	*	Ideally yes. If they can't survive, why tie up resources
t1_dswkslr	0	*	[But he had such a charismatic smile!](https://i.imgur.com/4MrziEE.mp4)  ^^^/s
t1_dsx0yhf	1	*	The Catholic Church opposes both.
t1_dswoycv	0	*	It's not, but if you can't see the salient similarity I don't know how to help you.
t1_dswnsr3	0	*	It probably has to do with the whole purposely ending a human life is murder reason. You know, just a hunch.
t1_dswrbs6	0	*	It's legal because it was deemed to fall under charter rights. Refusing someone an abortion is a violation of their rights. 
t1_dswvdaf	0	*	Canada is 89% white compared to the USA which is 61% white. So there is a large amount of racially, (thus cultural) homogenity 
t1_dswnd8v	0	*	It's not the same at all. It's baffling to me that you don't see that. 
t1_dswmaji	0	*	No, that's like saying a baby is not an adult. Which it isn't though it may someday be. I feel like you're arguing in bad faith.
t1_dsxr9fj	1	*	Oh I totally agree. Healthcare should be free at the point of use and for many people parking is a necessity. I was just pointing out the difference between countries.
t1_dswtoid	0	*	Well now it's time to check your profile. Surprise all you do is start fights. Later on dude.
t1_dswrd6c	0	*	Vasectomies can be reversed 
t1_dsx2u75	0	*	You have no say because the fetus is not inside you.
t1_dsxei5d	0	*	Woman's choice is absolute and the Canadian government right to support that in every way.
t1_dswqf56	0	*	Well that's just crazy!! By the time they get adopted they would be 5 years old!
t1_dswy19v	1	*	Then edit or delete your incorrect comment that has 150 upvotes. You're misinforming people.
t1_dswixxk	0	*	It could very easily be argued that they want to GIVE RIGHTS, the right to life to an unborn person. You are not seeing this from an unbiased position IMO.
t1_dswkf4h	0	*	Can you please cite the SCC case where they declared ANY restrictions on abortion unconstitutional ?
t1_dswlt7q	0	*	Bang on, you hit the nail square on the head with that one.
t1_dswohbh	1	*	Even the most ardent pro lifers think that abortion would be justifiable if the mothers life was threatened.
t1_dswumav	0	*	Not subsidising and banning something are two entirely different things
t1_dswospu	0	*	In your mind, but not in reality. There are people who do it   It is not unreasonable to expect that at a certain point you are killing a baby. And consequently hit could be viewed as murder.
t1_dswvqqq	0	*	Something something woman's body something something parasite something something birth
t1_dswxgrv	1	*	Every major party in Canada is pro-choice. 
t1_dswkut1	0	*	And pro open borders people can share their own homes and neighborhoods. That logic is inconsistent.
t1_dswl76j	0	*	Your definition of violence is completely warped.
t1_dswt4mp	0	*	They restrict funding if they don't agree with the statement about discrimination, which includes any form of trying to advocate for the removal of reproductive rights. 
t1_dswpiqi	0	*	Or be pro life until there is a clearer line.  Or draw the line further back.   20 weeks is hardly pragmatic.
t1_dswxjel	1	*	Not on reddit. 
t1_dswpa3g	1	*	This.
t1_dsynv8f	1	*	So I say you don't know what your talking about, and your response is No, you?  That was disappointing?
t1_dsy4u7v	1	*	What makes it human and based on what? Come on, it isnt that hard to answer that. Four comments and counting. Be brave.  Edit: Four comments and no answer. That is self-explanatory.
t1_dsy0ta5	1	*	Yeah, no.
t1_dswvcth	0	*	The pain capable/consciousness argument is bull because the same people who support the death penalty and torture are pretty much a 1:1 match up with the forced birthers. 
t1_dsx4tux	0	*	Lol dude, you're arguing against a straw man.  The evidence that government programs lift people out of poverty is not so good 
t1_dswmz64	0	*	And YOU can have any opinion you want. Your organization cannot advocate or hold as a mandate some thing that violates Charter rights and still receive funding.
t1_dswmlje	0	*	Nope. Her body. The feotus is not human. 
t1_dswmtft	0	*	It's not that difficult. 
t1_dswo98o	0	*	Theyre upset because thats not principled democracy. If the people wanted Bernie (and it would seem they did) the party shouldnt have actively worked against him. 
t1_dswqfuz	1	*	But wouldn't it be better if they had kids when they wanted to and were able to look after them?
t1_dswmwz3	0	*	That's semantics. Pro-life groups would absolutely abolish the right to have an abortion if they could. Don't pretend otherwise.
t1_dsx71ca	1	*	That kind of politician in the US is nothing more than a pipe dream, sadly. 
t1_dswxjkd	0	*	The supreme court has determined that a cluster of unthinking, unfeeling cells is not a human being.
t1_dswk860	0	*	Eh, I'm willing to go out on a limb and say a baby in the last month of pregnancy is a bit close to actual child for my comfort level.
t1_dswpief	0	*	You kill more cells when you masturbate than when a woman aborts. 
t1_dswrs1p	1	*	Dem mental gymnastics 
t1_dswlzbu	0	*	Well, if you have to delve that far, saying Oh, they aren't trying to make it illegal, they are just trying to force everyone to their opinion, you may have a problem with comprehension in general.
t1_dswpnov	0	*	That's not what you said though. You said I should ignore the killing of a baby because it isn't mine.
t1_dsxbpok	0	*	What do you mean? Who did he sell out to?
t1_dsyo4r2	0	*	The wording of the box you check specifically says reproductive rights, referring to abortion.
t1_dsx9k6u	1	*	Because Trudeau is pro LGBT and not anti abortion. Pro lifers aren't getting censored (unless they outright harass abortion clinic patients).
t1_dsx5jj3	0	*	Who says that they're mutually exclusive?
t1_dsxdcnt	1	*	You may not consider it harassment, but ask someone who has had, or has to have an abortion whether they deem it harassment.
t1_dswprih	1	*	More than half of the Mormon families Ive known have adopted or fostered at least one kid. One family that I knew growing up had adopted four kids and fostered many others
t1_dswmqeo	0	*	We should definitely kill all children that end up in the foster care system. It's just the moral thing to do. 
t1_dswr7s9	0	*	What if after the baby is born the mother decides it's not a life and she blows it's brains out is that ok?  
t1_dswvogw	0	*	She also is the sovereign of Canada, which means she IS the state. She is Canada, legally speaking.
t1_dswubec	0	*	However, they see it as protecting lives. Should murder be legalized since it's taking away the murderers' choice to murder?
t1_dsy1ayj	0	*	The government doesn't fund most anti-gun groups and are certainly not the main source of revenue, but the government does give some of them funding.  
t1_dsxx0uu	1	*	The title of the article:  > Trudeau **bans** anti-abortion groups from summer jobs funding  I think that's why.
t1_dswpfou	0	*	People make mistakes. We all do. Im gonna go out on a limb and say youre a male. Doesnt have be all about bad judgement. 
t1_dswu2rc	0	*	Its not theirs either is it? Nor your body. Did your mother have bodily autonomy when she was yet to be born? 
t1_dswr6hc	0	*	Right but maybe let's talk about what's really wrong: killing a human or killing a human conscience?
t1_dswqbhr	0	*	fuck off, no one cares about your denial of favoritism. It was rigged.
t1_dswnnt2	0	*	That's democracy.  Don't like it?  There are a few countries which aren't democratic.
t1_dswzfxq	0	*	http://reddit.com/r/AskAnAmerican/comments/6tnxa4/americans_would_you_ever_consider_a_foreigner_an/dlmajwl  I think this comment, might be wrong though 
t1_dswrq2l	0	*	If the court case he cited set precedent then yes it now supports reproductive Rights.  I know I'm not using the right words. I'm more of a bird law expert.   Edit: you all taking this way to serious
t1_dsx069c	1	*	Of course you did, little Billy. Here's your participation award. Now, go swing at that T-ball.
t1_dswnllm	0	*	A lot of that could be due to the fact that it's illegal
t1_dswkvq5	0	*	All hail. Thou shalt be king hereafter
t1_dswpsb3	0	*	>Why is potential on equal footing or even higher than the actual person carrying it?  You are saying you get one or the other, or I am misunderstanding your wording.
t1_dswoxt7	1	*	my mom and both uncles were adopted. Adoption and fostering is two different things. 
t1_dsxcgeo	0	*	I'm using this story to talk about discrimination more generally. Unless Canada doesn't have anti discrimination laws then they are indeed forcing people to associate.
t1_dsxsa8m	1	*	Thank you. I am not fully against abortion. I just hate that there's no dialogue here
t1_dswjnqp	1	*	How about unrestricted gun rights?
t1_dsy7awf	1	*	Moral treachery?  How so?

t1_dsxp3lm	1	*	Good one! Well, you clearly know best, as your well thought out argument clearly demonstrates.
t1_dswo79z	0	*	Right now at least. Give it time, I'm sure the issue will come around again at some point and Canada will see the error in their ways. Don't you worry about it
t1_dswyakr	0	*	If you call mindless support by twisting facts and creating straight up falsehoods, love - then sure. 
t1_dswkwts	0	*	Am I having a stroke
t1_dswpt8o	0	*	>If you have to fall back on extreme outlier cases where the mother's life is in danger to justify abortion as a whole, it shows how weak the argument is.
t1_dsyoaxq	1	*	I think it was overtly implied that he was not referring just to Canada, but to many other countries whose citizens often give their opinion on USA politics.
t1_dsx7znr	0	*	The life and viability of an 8-week fetus is demonstrably inferior and less valuable than that of the human mother. Get out of the way of her family planning. Pretty simple.  
t1_dsxq8pa	0	*	Some babies can survive out of the womb at 6 months old or so.  That wouldn't be a C-Section in the US.  I don't know how it is in Canada.  
t1_dswnvc9	1	*	also, I can think about an instance of someone not being able to get condoms.  I can also think of that instance where the two responsible adults go: Well maybe we shouldn't have sex tonight.
t1_dswrolv	1	*	Either. One living would be preferable to both dying. I make no distinction between them.
t1_dswip6a	0	*	No in the view of pro-life individuals theyre not simply restricting rights. Instead they are valuing an infants life over a womens right to choose. 
t1_dsxfbqh	1	*	The mainstream Republicans idiotically went into the campaign thinking Jeb! was a good idea.
t1_dsws6b7	1	*	Recent breakthroughs in embryology have revealed so much, and are so catastrophic to the pro-choice it's not a human or it's not a life claims that it has now developed into a women's right issue. 
t1_dswrkbb	1	*	He rules in his own smooth way. North Americans should be happy to have him in a position of power right now. About the law itself, fuck yeah. 
t1_dsx0725	0	*	Dont be like that. You know thats not the issue at all. The issue really does just boil down to at what point do you believe a fetid is a child. 
t1_dswn4ui	0	*	That makes him a sociopath? Wut
t1_dsxfjp4	0	*	Youve clearly not seen (or are willfully ignorant of) the blatant racism and xenophobia and hate that is spewed from that  cesspool
t1_dswq77y	1	*	The answer to that is: not really. In that respect English is exactly like any other language. Easier to learn than many.  Source: am a foreigner
t1_dsx4mjx	1	*	Yes
t1_dsxvxw3	1	*	Fully agree. Life is a gift. Its the right side to be on. 
t1_dswrelv	0	*	No, it was efficient.
t1_dswoezm	0	*	I assume I understand the sentence but I am not sure. And I am pretty billangual. Chipper??
t1_dsx18r6	1	*	A financial obstacle!  So if the gov don't give them free money they cant do what?
t1_dswmex7	1	*	Are they going around promoting drinking and smoking and asking for funds to do so?
t1_dswmprx	0	*	Nice job refuting my point. Would read again. 
t1_dswyxmw	0	*	Which I never said.
t1_dswu0v0	0	*	Last I checked I think the Governor General is just appointed by the Prime Minister?
t1_dswodpc	0	*	As long as the driving force behind your organization isn't repressing reproductive rights you're ok
t1_dswq0eo	0	*	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery  yes it is.  unfree labor, bought and sold, prison labor is used for private businesses.
t1_dswr5op	1	*	Oh, please educate me on what about pregnancy that makes it moral to kill someone else to avoid?
t1_dsxl0i3	0	*	yes yes, 8th continent, which I wrote where? You actually seem to be completely illiterate and braindead
t1_dsy9rcp	1	*	Commonwealth of Nations: 2.3B people.  English speaking Nations: 1.5B poeple.  FYI...
t1_dswnxq3	0	*	**Organizations core mandate must respect**  does not mean  **Personal belief must be held**
t1_dt0vx5c	1	*	Oh, sorry, oral sex only, maybe in Canada that's not sex?
t1_dswpx1l	0	*	Discomfort = extremely immoral. Murder = less immoral.  Got it. For the record thats gross. Good luck with that moral compass of yours.
t1_dswo7f0	0	*	What facts are the pro-choice side justified by?
t1_dsxkq6w	0	*	Nothing to do with DNA or uniqueness.  So... something that is inside a woman's body, literally attached isn't part of her body?  No, that is silly. Please try again.  
t1_dswqf5l	0	*	Lol. I like to think that our global reputation would help prevent another country from trying to conquer us. We have a lot of friends that would be quite upset if that happened.
t1_dswsjpb	0	*	Of course. I think humans have human rights and there is no taking that away from them.
t1_dswqkyr	1	*	In Canada we believe strongly in pro choice.  Take this argument and keep it, but this is what most of us believe. 
t1_dswr4at	1	*	English slang is actually pretty tame compared to say, french, for example. 
t1_dswnj91	0	*	He believes the bible is the literal truth. :/.  That is the type of PM we as a country elected.
t1_dswwey2	0	*	Well no. Bill of Rights 1689. The crown can't execute or dispense laws without consent of Parliament. 
t1_dsx8tnk	0	*	That's nice. It is still 100% legal here and will remain so.
t1_dswp0n8	0	*	what if she respects the rights of the unborn?
t1_dswkpr8	0	*	Actually, nine, though the vast majority happen in earlier stages. Canada is one of 3 countries that has no restrictions on abortions. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abortion_in_Canada
t1_dswm3wv	1	*	The only 'real reason' that is needed is that the woman wants an abortion and is legally capable of making that decision.
t1_dswqq7u	0	*	Yes, she does.  Women do acknowledge what abortion does.  They are the ones that are actually having them.  Do you honestly believe any woman who has an abortion doesn't know what an abortion does? 
t1_dswxin7	0	*	I have you the definition of child already and survivability outside the womb is not part of the definition.  And the unborn child is not an invader but a new organism fostered by the host's body.
t1_dsx4g42	0	*	Are you saying retarded people don't deserve to live? And that is cruel to let them be alive?
t1_dswoedn	0	*	Nah, all languages have weird bullshit. I'll probably get it wrong but German has 'ich Fresse einen wessen' which means I'll eat a broom.
t1_dswnv83	0	*	Sneaky fused labias making their way into coffee unexpectedly
t1_dswkydw	0	*	I would still. You are allowed to believe what you want in Canada. You should not get Summer job funding cut for that belief. As long as it doesn't incite racism or violence.
t1_dswnna9	0	*	Does a person in a coma have rights? What about if your sister gets in a car crash and is left a wheelchair bound paraplegic who drools and can't go to the bathroom on her own? Does she have rights?
t1_dswuxz6	1	*	gabba gabba hey !
t1_dswnhuw	0	*	I teach it as a second language. Idioms can fuck off and die.
t1_dswkvug	0	*	That's ridiculous, But I'm not going to say you should be defunded for your belief of that
t1_dsx9gfz	1	*	Financial harm isn't grounds for physical self defense. Also, adoption is a thing. 
t1_dswnyv7	1	*	That's not really what cherry picking means.
t1_dsx3o1u	0	*	What. I proved you wrong multiple times and that's how you answer? LOL.
t1_dswl11l	0	*	What if I'm against abortion and vehemently advocate for supporting the child, even if it means the state stepping in and covering all costs
t1_dsx4hmk	1	*	shouldn't have gotten pregnant then. 
t1_dsx47fk	1	*	Of course it is because killing your baby is a god-given right, ya know.
t1_dsx1rpk	1	*	Of course not.  Just wondering how frequently you kill and eat unique non-sapient beings without worrying about it.
t1_dswry8x	0	*	Fascism is anti-democracy. The denial of free speech or equal treatment due to political difference. It is the government using its authority to quash a (usually minority) view point.
t1_dswr8g0	0	*	You didn't answer the question. Do anti-abortionists think that men should be allowed to have abortions but women shouldn't?
t1_dswnwqs	0	*	lying to us. the constant lying about ethics etc that made me not like the guy.
t1_dsws9ks	0	*	One week before birth: aborting is fine? Third trimester: aborting is fine?  It's a gray line dude, NOT cut and dry.
t1_dsx7uyn	0	*	The amount of blatantly wrong and made up information in your comment leads me to believe you're a fox news viewer. 
t1_dsxzhgq	0	*	Ooh, the babies are literal parasites argument pops up again. Also a 7 month old fetus can survive without its host so your argument is false. 
t1_dswsmk0	1	*	Its no difference from other languages.
t1_dsxocef	0	*	If neither side can prove where life begins isn't it best to err on the side of caution? 
t1_dswpatx	0	*	Yes it does. 
t1_dsxacz6	1	*	I dont draw some arbitrary line. Thats my point. A fetus isnt basically a tadpole; its a human being, albeit one at an early stage of development.  And no, I dont eat meat.
t1_dswlxnb	0	*	YouTube videos are not sources.
t1_dsz94g7	0	*	And the oppression is where? Those groups not getting the free money stops them from doing stuff how?
t1_dswmwxb	0	*	Which province requires that?
t1_dsxcdiu	1	*	Or because instead of letting users grow their own poppies, coca, ephedra, prohibition allows organized crime to distribute 
t1_dswmhnl	1	*	Fuckin' rights bud, you got 'er smack dab in the middle.
t1_dswziqz	0	*	What are you talking about?  The GOP had one of the most politically experienced fields we've seen in recent history.  Multiple term governors, senators, etc.  
t1_dswjnp9	0	*	Their? You speak as if its all one entity. The fallacies grow.
t1_dsxl25m	1	*	I respect your opinion but it's not one shared by the vast majority of Canadians.
t1_dswngx4	0	*	You, my soup kitchen client, you support abortion! NO SOUP FOR YOU!   Nothing says you can't have your beliefs. You just can't use government funding to crusade against abortions.
t1_dswp3bj	0	*	That's like saying well, murder still happens even though it's illegal so I guess we might as well make it legal.
t1_dsx8knw	0	*	I didn't say you said that, it was literally a question, and not a rhetorical question, I was asking what you thought.
t1_dsyislr	0	*	Sorry my fact triggered you and showed that you have no clue what the fuck you are talking about. 
t1_dsxdcfj	0	*	Because it is the government's money so they can set policies on how it is spent?   Nothing to do with legal.
t1_dswmwk6	1	*	That's not a relevant distinction at all
t1_dswl5my	1	*	Cut funding and not provide funding you were previously providing sound awfully similar to me. 
t1_dsxp7k7	0	*	I just asked my Canadian friend from Ottawa. They agreed with me. Sorry, our bad. I guess next time I'm interested in Canada I'll ask a Michigander xaf\\\_()_/xaf

t1_dsx28zv	1	*	I have to say if thats truly what you believe, then you're living in the wrong Canada.
t1_dswreyk	0	*	Don't move the goalposts. Morning after/etc is a different category.
t1_dswm7qb	0	*	Just remember you're not even talking to a Canadian, I don't think he'll know anything about our Charter or the rights of citizens in Canada.
t1_dswse4o	0	*	You're creating a straw man argument. These two are not similar. At. All.
t1_dswmuba	0	*	It funds the National Women's Council of Ireland. I am not involved with the organisation so I don't know. Does it?
t1_dsy6d6s	1	*	Right.  So thank you for supporting my position. The anti-abortion movement would continue.

t1_dswsdl3	1	*	A lot of small businesses utilize it, as well. It's a way for students to get real job experience outside of McDonald's and also a way for small businesses to help offset some payroll costs
t1_dswv0lw	1	*	That's fine but to my knowledge California is not a part of Canada and Californians in California are not subject to Canadian law and vice versa. 
t1_dswmtgs	0	*	Sure. Adoption is a good alternative if you don't feel quite ready to care for a child. More people should adopt when feasible. It's a bit pricey, though.
t1_dswrd0k	0	*	Aborting you as a fetus would have ended your life before it had begun. That would constitutes harm.
t1_dswu4wu	0	*	Not really no. By that definition, I could murder my relatives instead of putting them in homes and paying for them.   Give the kid up for adoption. There are countless couples looking for kids.
t1_dswpnev	0	*	 Thanks I learned something new.   Although the line is still arbitrary. Being in pain doesn't make something human or not.   Is someone not a murderer because they killed them in their sleep? 
t1_dsxe3pp	1	*	Sensationalism aside, what is your earliest memory? People are not conscious in any real sense for quite some time after conception.
t1_dswr9so	0	*	It is wrong to be anti-gay. I am happy that a hateful anti-gay group will not receive government funding. You will not change my mind on this.

t1_dswplwk	0	*	Bishhhhhhh
t1_dswktjf	1	*	Why?
t1_dswum2e	1	*	I just realized how many paragraphs I wrote.  Ugh.  This is why I normally try to distance myself from this kind of discussion.
t1_dswv7px	0	*	There's a massive difference between supporting a decision, and supporting a person's right to make that decision.   That is the entire essence of the words pro-choice.
t1_dswnvux	1	*	Your in the a group that wants it not your group specifically. Sorry should have used better words.
t1_dsxcu85	1	*	The inverse can be argued as well
t1_dswkp1a	0	*	> if someone chooses to murder a child, someone can't claim to oppose that murder unless they're personally willing to adopt the child
t1_dswm1xu	1	*	Generalize much? I lean pro-life and I'm not at all religious. I care very much about human life, both before and after birth.
t1_dswp02r	0	*	I'm sorry that you are so naive to believe that some women don't choose to abort much later than others.  Just because you woudlnt doesn't mean others wont.
t1_dswk8l2	0	*	Why not?
t1_dswuryk	1	*	Are you saying that the government should only fund groups that don't oppose any current laws of the country?
t1_dswqtzt	0	*	Thanks for proving his point.
t1_dsxrenc	1	*	It is descended from English common law, and is considered a recognition of an existing right.
t1_dsx3mam	1	*	? I explained this. Read all my answers to points in this comment chain, and you will see.
t1_dswmafj	1	*	I mean... this is a complete and total ridiculous generalization.  My husband is agnostic and hes pro life. 
t1_dswkxhg	1	*	I think they're struggling with the concept of a pregnant man.
t1_dty98ez	0	*	Feelings have no bearing on the issue. Canadian law is clear on the subject so is the government hence the policy.  This whole ya but ya but they really don't like abortion is neither here nor there.

t1_dswrhol	0	*	I'm not taking a side. I'm stating a fact. Our Charter does not guarantee reproductive rights. Period.  My personal feelings don't matter, you made a incorrect statement and I corrected you.
t1_dsx2h8h	1	*	It's hard to convict yourself in your own name
t1_dsy3e9z	0	*	Your concern is a pregnant woman may give birth to a dog or cat so it shouldn't considered human until it's birthed? I mean.....I don't know who you hang out with but I haven't seen that before.
t1_dsws4en	0	*	A fetus developing normally is a person. Everyone who has and will live has been a fetus. To act as if they are separate entities is disingenuous.
t1_dswwoh3	0	*	They're comparing the American party system with the Canadian party system. I'm explaining why the American party system works even though they can't force a candidate to hold to the party line.
t1_dsxtx85	0	*	Yup, legitimately went from being sheltered by his family his whole life to being an MPP.
t1_dswvs8y	1	*	Well can't argue with that logic, maths checks out. Carry on my Canadian friends. What a weird system you guys have over there, I think I'll stick with Imperial time

t1_dsx5p53	0	*	When was the last time the bill of rights was changed?
t1_dswm6q2	0	*	Its not easy to adopt. For every 1 baby thats up for adoption, there are 36 couples who want to adopt (in the US). 
t1_dswo9vz	1	*	That's awesome.
t1_dswuav8	1	*	I explained in detail why his argument is terrible elsewhere.. but it's trying dealing with comparisons which are ridiculous.

t1_dswq0dr	0	*	Dont forget that bizarre foray into barbaric cultural practices and appeals to old guard Canadians  Lost his mind that last year in office... 
t1_dsx532g	1	*	But more than most, seeing as to how Catholics are one of the most consistently pro-life groups.
t1_dsx03zr	1	*	Still disingenuous, in all fairness. Some people on the left like to hear the opinions of their political opponents, just like those on the right or the centre.
t1_dsx41ec	1	*	I was replying to a sarcastic statement with sarcasm. Of course people are going to have irresponsible sex. But there will always be a negative consequence for it.
t1_dsxn6ii	0	*	While Ad Hominems make you look intellectually lazy, Ill take it over your demanding I defend positions I dont hold.   Good job. Youre improving.

t1_dswvpzz	1	*	Wouldn't the Doctor be infringing on the woman's right to autonomy by making the decision for her?
t1_dswnsmv	1	*	There is no difference between those two things
t1_dswtb6q	1	*	>People seem to forget this tidbit.   Could you link to which emails you're referring to?  It seems that whenever people bring them up, they don't actually support what the person is claiming... 
t1_dswv760	0	*	If you use the word believe, you already lost the argument.
t1_dswzxxl	1	*	I don't ignore rape victims just because they make up a small percent. I would have empathy for them even if they were 0.01%.
t1_dswxh8s	1	*	Yep, and then Hillary bought the DNC.
t1_dswo0v0	0	*	Comparing the potential to life between a lone sperm and a fertilized egg is disingenuous. 
t1_dswp642	0	*	Um, Trudeau is Canadian
t1_dsyskai	0	*	I simply want women to acknowledge what an abortion does. If doing so makes them feel guilty, then perhaps they should ask themselves why.  
t1_dsxc7vg	1	*	Alcohol comes in 4th place for hardest drug. I hope you know that. There are a dozen illegal drugs safer than alcohol and hundreds ob illegal drugs safer than tobacco. 
t1_dswlray	0	*	Not kissing a religions ass is not the same as persecution.
t1_dswlnhb	1	*	I wish the mods would come and delete all of the other comments and just leave yours. It is torture reading through this mountain of shit to find the nugget of truth. 
t1_dswrnzl	0	*	Look, I clearly explained it to someone below why it's a ridiculous comparison. Feel free to read that. It's in this comment thread here, replied to someone who replied to this comment.
t1_dswnqts	0	*	What did you think about when you were one of two? Should we be allowed to kill toddlers?
t1_dsxc8w5	1	*	True. I wouldnt ever think shes talking about Canadians out of context but it just seems like she might be considering the story is about canada
t1_dsx39od	0	*	That is preventing a kid. It's just not preventing a pregnancy.
t1_dswrtq5	1	*	But what does the research in Uganda have to say?
t1_dswojn4	0	*	It can very easily be transformed into law and I'd actually say that right now the facts are ambiguous enough to be able to support either side 
t1_dsx1era	1	*	Last time I checked you can still drive on a road if you're pro-life.
t1_dswo9ox	0	*	Wow a redditor actually admitted they may be overreacting. I don't know if you are or not but I feel like this may be a first time for this website

t1_dtcv4j9	0	*	Okay, don't overlook them, post an article about them and we'll discuss.  In the meantime, you're just playing Whatabout to deflect from Russia and Trump's involvement
t1_dtcrtv3	0	*	Lol I'll believe it when you short every major corp in the US with your whole life savings. Don't get me wrong, this isn't going to last, but you know fuck all about when she's coming down.

t1_ds162qe	0	*	For someone anti-nazi you seem to take a lot of tips from them
t1_ds1ty3h	0	*	It is a fact that far right groups have risen in popularity in Europe over the last decade.  Apparently European hate speech laws were ineffective in their task.
t1_ds1uxi6	1	*	German law punishes the open incitement of hatred. Having an opinion like that is not itself a crime.
t1_ds12azb	0	*	Get used to it. You'll be hearing a lot more from liberals that are done playing nice with the far-right.

t1_ds6e9zk	0	*	That's why the US has the 2/3 requirement to change the Constitution. Very difficult to do. However you don't change the rules after the vote. This needs to be decided for the future.

t1_dt9h1ij	1	*	You're right, all of this would hinge on some serious crimes and like 15 republicans doing the right thing. One of those things seems plausible, but two? No way.
t1_dt9bmmu	0	*	Why would Fox News confirm a report that casts the president in a negative light with a non credible source?

t1_dt9cpmd	0	*	Please don't call somewhat an idiot when clearly you're the uninformed one. You don't know how surveys work. 
t1_dt9fuqo	0	*	Unless he loses the Speakership to Pelosi following the midterms. Remember - all 435 are up for grabs, and it's unlikely that the Democrats elect a Republican Speaker.
t1_dt9q8hm	1	*	Both, actually
t1_dt9cwou	1	*	Willing is probably not the right word. I dont think we can imagine the fear the regime instilled if you were to do anything but look away. 
t1_dt9blcd	0	*	What about FOX News confirming it? What do you have to say about that? Trumps own personal ass lickers have confirmed the story true.

t1_dt9bs2r	0	*	If Foles plays like he did the other night, it's far from a given that my Pats win. 
t1_dt9zcs7	1	*	They're leveraging daca to get their own immigration priorities like the wall and security passed. It's not that they don't want it it's that they can use it as leverage because dems want it more. 
t1_dtaa8nb	0	*	You're the one who knee jerk downvoted me then insulted me after you ran out of arguments. Funny how often people project on reddit.

t1_dt9q01n	0	*	Leader of the deplorable. 
t1_dt9fb16	0	*	And next in line would be Orrin Hatch, Rex Tillerson, and Steven Mnuchin
t1_dt9dppw	1	*	But Trump himself indulges in all these baseless conspiracies. He either does this because he is an ill informed moron, or because he is deliberately misleading his base. Why is either acceptable?

t1_dt9snvd	1	*	As soon as people start thinking the Dems will surely win in the midterms is exactly when the Dems will have lost the midterms.  
t1_dtaaj4l	0	*	Well, if we shoot further and aim for SecDef, we might miss and end up with SecHUD, and if First Past The Post has taught me anything, it's that we're supposed to settle for the lesser of two evils.

t1_dt9e0q3	0	*	The Penguins aren't that good this year relative to what they've been the last two years.   But the Lightning have been on fire all year. I'm actually really looking forward to a Boston-Tampa series.
t1_dt9f92l	1	*	The IP stuff is out, or at least is suspended. The pharma stuff was severely weakened, IIRC.
t1_dtaom9d	0	*	You should give it another shot, maybe starting with or just before the winter soldier episodes.
t1_dta50qr	0	*	Oh honey, you think I live in the south because I support the president? When you grow up and you learn to think critically you will realize how fucking stupid you are currently.
t1_dt9r3e0	1	*	Democrats at the time were the conservatives of the country. Republicans were the liberals. The parties switched platforms. 
t1_dtatnom	1	*	 Point well taken, and thanks for a measured response.
t1_dt9eug2	1	*	Man, are you gonna be super disappointed as life goes on.
t1_dt9eprv	1	*	A large number of Trump supporters, many of whom marched and burned Tiki torches in Charlottesville, and one of whom is attorney general.
t1_dt9zrpd	1	*	You know, I really trusted Obama with his big hands, what've you got to make me believe?
t1_dt9gpma	0	*	And that's why you are delusional. Try looking at issues objectively and stop fooling yourself just because you voted for him. It's alright to admit that the guy you voted for is fucking up.

t1_dt9v4gy	0	*	A person can be very intelligent but morally bankrupt. I would give them a 0 for wisdom though. Destroying the economy and the environment for short term economic gain is not wise.

t1_dt9zvd2	0	*	The assault weapons ban cost the democrats the most seats in history including the speaker of the house. It was a 54 seat swing in 1994, and the democrats had controlled the house since the 1950s.

t1_dt9ba36	0	*	You said that Fox News was reporting on a report. I quoted the first paragraph of the article that proves otherwise. Do you admit you were incorrect?
t1_dtauvof	1	*	Either way hes wrong.
t1_dtarbu2	1	*	Genius of the Stables.
t1_dt9h2e0	1	*	Ryan is complicit.

t1_dt9a8c3	0	*	On a dime or for a dime?
t1_dt9ak3c	1	*	I'd go ahead and add the /s, if I were you. There are too many people in this thread making these type of statements legitimately.

t1_dt9bquk	0	*	What evidence lol you people are pathetic. 
t1_dt9web0	0	*	It doesn't really matter how you personally feel about the cops, they're allowed to do their jobs.

t1_dt9g0o5	0	*	They should just rename their party Regressive Devolution, which coincidentally would make a good metal band name
t1_dtcw4kz	1	*	> Also, Trump's cabinet was selected by banks, too. Have you seen who he has?  It is finance heavy but I doubt he's beholding to anyone. He's best known for firing people. 
t1_dt9sqnq	1	*	Dude you took the words right out of my mouth. 
t1_dt9gqu0	1	*	Aids and cancer are basically nothing alike. Its like saying cancer is the same as a bad fall because both can kill you.
t1_dt97ark	0	*	Its just another thing on the mountain of stupid things Trump has done that aren't actually criminal. I'm so past being mad about it by now. 
t1_dtb2dt0	1	*	Just answer the question please.
t1_dt9f301	1	*	I know. I found that it has helped. Just post this wjen combating anyone who thinks they need it.
t1_ds4htmm	0	*	Lol polls. No thanks. Do you even naver?
t1_ds4hs4v	1	*	That would result in the UN coming in an imposing sanctions and so on. But I don't believe Trump would be willing to come to SK's aid if we are no longer allies and NK stops provoking the US. 
t1_ds4dg1e	0	*	Well sure although that doesn't mean Kim would keep it like that.  If the US stopped coming to SK's assistance, would Kim invade them? It benefits China as it supports their buffer-state policy.
t1_ds8kdfb	1	*	Student with SK friends and met NK students (long story, Tsinghua University visit), the majority of them studying international relations here, both Koreas do want unification.
t1_duodjyv	0	*	Exactly what I was thinking. Just how many Russian trolls are working in this thread?

t1_duo3h5y	0	*	Term limits mean there's a bunch of rookie congressmen who look to lobbyists to teach them the job
t1_dupkagm	1	*	This is a newspaper. Not direct party message output. Does fox news represent the white house?
t1_duo18w8	1	*	Well you admit you don't know what's going on so I fail to see the point in going further with you, but I think you are mistaken in assuming his exposes aren't damaging to the regime.
t1_dunrlqu	0	*	You're engaging with someone who has half their posts defending Russia. You're expected to convince him?

t1_duopuf0	0	*	Say deep state and I'll cut your sack off 
t1_duojk3w	1	*	The commenter literally expressed a fear of islam. That's islamophobia. If you want to inject a debate on the merits of one of the world's religions there are other forums for that.
t1_dunw3un	1	*	No, the electoral college was created due to technological limits. The mechanism designed to prevent major cities making all decisions is why we have the senate and the house. 
t1_dunzm34	1	*	The electoral college was created to allow the landed elite in Maryland to select our President when the poor try to elect someone who will represent the interests of the poor.

t1_dtq5uux	1	*	Not quality brewers. You won't see a trappist come in a can. None of the Belgian brewers put anything but their mass market beers in cans.
t1_dtq4row	1	*	Doesn't explain the beads and courderoy. 
t1_dtppgsk	0	*	He cunningly took the issue from, teenagers are being poisoned by plastic products, to science is pretty good.   No one was criticizing science...

t1_dtq0m90	1	*	underrated 
t1_dtpxuoy	0	*	Ask Tumblr.
t1_dtpv45s	0	*	Yes quite, canned food is pasteurized inside the sealed can in 99%+ cases.   You're talking about foods that are not sold in cans. Like milk.  Apples in a conversation about oranges
t1_dtq0peh	0	*	Neat. I don't suppose this has been demonstrated in humans yet because of ethical concerns? It'd be cool to just make everyone bisexual at birth.
t1_dtpx6hb	0	*	High concentrations of most things applied directly to cancer cells kills them. 
t1_dtq0b6c	0	*	Edit : sorry to overreact. Soft as baby shit, jesus

t1_dtgv9k3	1	*	It's not so great a price when no one in the US can make a good cup of tea anyway.
t1_dtg595t	1	*	He often just repeats what the last person said to him so yeah he does all the time.
t1_dtgirrn	1	*	Her freaky long hands fit perfectly with his small... hands

t1_dtg5qm2	1	*	Well, yeah, theres like a million Starbucks here
t1_dtgned9	1	*	What? The UK joined WW1 in support of Belgian neutrality that was violated by the German invasion of France. 
t1_dtgeie4	0	*	Neo-nazis want to get rid of minorities. Antifa wants to get rid of neo-nazis. Totally the same.
t1_dtfulul	1	*	Lets hope.  Trump is dragging the US backward 40 years, and SA is already there, but trying to come the other way. Early days yet though.
t1_dtg17rh	1	*	Thank God natural selection still has some way to work.
t1_dtgv85k	1	*	It was also very true.

t1_dtmu19b	0	*	The Sun
t1_dtnwoax	1	*	Trump has yet to reach the level of bad that some of the other Presidents have reached this is false. He is already way lower.

t1_dtmyj9e	0	*	He's getting caught, that is a plus. My problem is how the hell did we get stuck with two demons?
t1_dtocnmd	0	*	Doesnt need to swing the whole vote, just 4% if it. My point is that with a narrow margin, an issue doesnt have to be the main issue to make a crucial difference. Dont get why thats so controversial.
t1_dto6p7e	1	*	Funnily enough some of us don't want another ten years of sabotaging our economic growth in pursuit of a fantasy that has no evidence of actually happening.
t1_dtn112s	0	*	Still better than the Redskins
t1_dtnbhro	1	*	Almost never and depends on the country.
t1_dtn7hvw	0	*	Wasn't there a report from an Australian paper that said the us military would lose the next major conflict because of how poorly trained our military is?
t1_dtmtr6f	1	*	Yea pretty much, she won't buy anything French, I told her I will move to France so she won't visit me.
t1_dto2xyp	1	*	That's the Liverpool version of Girls Gone Wild right?
t1_dtmx461	0	*	Well, I think Americans think there is a slight chance because the Scottish referendum was so close.

t1_dtnx6he	0	*	Don't be daft. The Brexit vote is an awful idea but a majority voted for it.
t1_dtno713	0	*	You said Brexit was done for reasons outside financial. What are they?
t1_dtnbtru	1	*	And goes on facebook a lot too by any chance? 
t1_dto58eu	1	*	Well, the best way to cope with people wanting to reduce immigration is education. Unfortunately, education is the enemy of the Tories, so they won't do that.
t1_dtn6to0	0	*	Well, I'm only 19, but I think Leave is a good idea. Should my vote not be counted?
t1_dtnfxzo	0	*	People tend to act with surprise when you say something absolutely ridiculous.
t1_dtnmpiq	0	*	The Brexit vote wasn't 3 years ago, it was a year and a half ago. They voted in June of 2016

t1_dt8k9ny	0	*	On the verge of an imminent attack by Egypt. Then Israel hit their airfields preventing a full invasion 
t1_dt8qjlo	0	*	Israel plainly stated to Egypt that kicking the UN, who were legally allowed and supposed to be there, out of the Sinai peninsula would be a cause of war
t1_dt89t30	0	*	You said that was the 90s. You now know that's false. Nobody said Palestinians are capable of wiping out Israel. That's obvious to the entire world. Their rockets land in empty fields.
t1_dt8nqo5	0	*	I apologize that not enough Israeli civilians have died to meet your unreasonable threshold for self defense.
t1_dt90xiv	1	*	They were elected by an overwhelming majority of voters, and Pew Research as well as Gallop opinion polls have shown that the vast majority of Palestinians currently support them.
t1_dt8i6bh	1	*	Yep, and Taiwan is totally not an officially separate state from mainland China.
t1_dt8lxzp	0	*	Egypt closing the Straits of Tiran was an act of war and thus the beginning of the war.    Israel did not start that war.
t1_dt8w8ld	0	*	So then why the FUCK would the United States try to pose as a neutral mediator?!
t1_dt9pi6t	1	*	Hamas is a terrorist group.
t1_dv1qb9l	0	*	Then it'd be flightless. It was as big as a bird can get and still fly.
t1_dv1t35b	1	*	Sound to me like there is some money to be made.
t1_dv28zsr	0	*	From what I read the eagles would carry off young children but couldn't pick up anything heavier than that 
t1_dv25268	0	*	Probably, but...it wouldn't LET you either. 
t1_duc7s0q	1	*	And the after effects of British Colonialism and the fall of the empire left a pretty big mess in its wake.
t1_dud3ryg	0	*	Yeah but wasn't Churchill overly terrible to his people, choosing to stay in a doomed conflict on the off-chance to be saved randomly by the Japanese invading the US instead of signing a peace?
t1_dudtand	0	*	If your 'flaw' extends to advocating the use of chemical weapons on civilians and contributing to a famine that killed 3 million people, you are no hero to begin with.
t1_ducf7xm	1	*	Yeah I meant the war where they were committing the atrocities. None of the other countries mentioned had tanks rolling through their capital to remind them of their mistakes.
t1_duci199	0	*	I mean, Churchill is widely held responsible for the Bengalis famine that led to millions of deaths, so it's not just his fucked up ideas and opinions that were a problem.
t1_ducfofy	0	*	Wait what does this have to do with Stalin? 
t1_dudcz1v	1	*	I'd give you a hand, but Leopold took them all.
t1_ducl5tn	0	*	That what I get from reading and he expects for you to pay medical bills and extra
t1_due50i2	1	*	I don't understand your point.  The Tokyo trials didn't stipulate what to do with the souls of the dead.    
t1_duc9hpd	0	*	It was exactly what i was referring to. 
t1_duc85ht	1	*	First time I heard that one. Cheers.
t1_ducd9hv	0	*	Churchill was responsible for Gallipoli during wwi. 
t1_duckui8	1	*	And Volkswagen.
t1_ducl37y	0	*	I see but do you know how to read? I agreed on that since the beginning. 
t1_dud3zhg	0	*	How was Germany worse then the USSR? If the world teamed up against communism instead of fascism, would things really be all that different?
t1_ducburt	0	*	There strategy for dealing with mine fields was just send the infantry over first so that the vehicles - which were far more valuable - didn't get damaged.
t1_duc84no	0	*	Still. Not Leopold bad. Or Norwegians sailors in Kongo working for Leopold-bad, but we never care about those. 
t1_duclwfq	0	*	It's alright he starved millions of them as they're better off now. Yes that truly is the case.
t1_ducjtus	0	*	That's a historical myth. The Soviets were tactically superior to the Germans, and especially during the early years of the war both sides were roughly numerically equal.
t1_dudzrxs	0	*	Churchhill was responsible for the Gallipoli campaign in WW1, which accomplished nothing but killed tens of thousands.
t1_dsg5hqb	0	*	Plenty of English people in England have ancestry elsewhere, whether Iran or India or Nigeria etc.

t1_dunm6te	1	*	Not required to shake hands in New Zealand, either, I'd bet. We're talking about respect for culture, not obedience to law.
t1_dunagsa	0	*	Some of us are atheists who don't follow anyone's words.   It's certainly not a religion, it's a distinct rejections of all religions as foolish fairy-tales, which they are.
t1_dunall2	0	*	How about judging the morality of how with the lens of today, Christianity is still used to justify sexism. 
t1_dsykope	0	*	It's not my fault that the democrats have chosen not to enforce the rule of law during the entirety of the Obama administration.
t1_dsyj5ue	0	*	They could burn your house down with you inside and you'd still blame Democrats for making them do it.
t1_dsyke39	0	*	They have the will of the majority, not the supermajority...
t1_dsyjcnd	0	*	It wasn't partisan for the Repubs.
t1_dsykjuk	0	*	Do you know why this is?

t1_dsp3wqm	1	*	Silicon is used in batteries... silicone is not.
t1_dsr5i67	0	*	Mining lithium to make batteries uses more energy than the batteries can ever carry.
t1_dv1b6hs	0	*	Whats the risk here? Blocked YouTube comments? Facebook removing your posts?   Who cares?
t1_du6axf9	1	*	2nd or 3rd tier cities in the south around the Fujian region has great air. 
t1_du54sxo	1	*	Ah you're an edge lord I understand now. 
t1_du6knfq	0	*	And you cannot win with an air force.  Natural barriers are still very real obstacles. Ask Libya in 1982.
t1_du5z88a	0	*	Think about it... a screen door on a submarine... screen doors aren't very water proof.
t1_du5se9t	1	*	Sigh...
t1_du5ft3d	0	*	People give the USA tons of shit but it is still pretty much the only country on the planet that isn't SOL if a handful of nations form an alliance and try to take over (cough cough WWI and WWII) 
t1_du53a06	0	*	Haha was waiting for that :p  Not to worry, Trump doesnt read reddit... although his name is mentioned quite a lot here so maybe....  _
t1_du5jyu0	1	*	Yes, that is the sound it makes (for a short period of time).
t1_du5ter5	1	*	What do you mean?
t1_du53e6v	1	*	NORAD I suppose. 
t1_dub1ui7	1	*	To prove bribery, you need to also prove something was given in exchange. Otherwise, it's just (maybe) breach of protocol - which amounts to a fine and a slap on the wrist.  
t1_dtmqvj1	1	*	It's clean uranium. Don't worry about.  Fox News; The president is not going to do anything about the radioactive waste seeping into your water suppl- LOOK AT THIS CAR CHASE OH MY GOD IS THAT A FIAT!?
t1_dtmc27b	1	*	Not so! Earth is a very resilient thing, were the future, and once the last generation is gone its going to be up to us to fix their mistakes. And we can do it too.

t1_dtlthkn	1	*	There is a difference between being culpable in a personal sense, and having a shit stain on your national identity that won't wash off. It's the refusal to accept the latter that I find distasteful.
t1_dtmnmg8	1	*	humanity doesnt have parents
t1_dtmqt0t	0	*	But he also said he want to increase it to thirty times the current amount or something, which it turned out would take something like 300 years to actually do?
t1_dtlwa0t	0	*	Heavy Metal Rapists.  That's gotta be a band already.  Radiation Rapist also kinda works from an alliteration point of view, but it makes a lot less sense.
t1_dtjt57i	0	*	If you find yourself outside of civilisation, and therefore suddenly an actual part of the food chain once again, you can test your theory.   You're right on a global scale, not on a personal one.

t1_dsw9uv9	0	*	Except he used his overriding power to put a fuel excise in and extended the trial. He also knighted prince charles which was one of the most retarded things Ive seen in a very very long time.
t1_dsxtbll	1	*	Yes, yes and yes.  His political party is called New Zealand First and as the name implies they're very nationalist.
t1_dswl843	1	*	The National Party, so both and neither of them.
t1_dswdbac	0	*	**Thunderous applause** from NZ, UK, and co  Meanwhile in, South Africa, India and co, So this is how our independence dies, with thunderous applause
t1_dswsvp8	0	*	That's probably payback for taking things that *are* Made in New Zealand and re-labeling them as Made in Australia... ;-)
t1_dswslwk	0	*	And I thought the list of all the titles for Daenerys was unrealistic. If you need half an hour to address a person properly, no wonder it leads to overinflated egos more often than not.
t1_dsyoq90	0	*	Oooo so edgy. Yeah you did buddy, its ok. Dont feel insecure, mummy will cuddle you xoxox

t1_dsyf4fq	1	*	>embarrassingly immature and moronic.  Pretty accurately describes your comment, since apparently you think pregnant women are schizophrenic and fathers are incapable of taking care of babies. 
t1_dswtk4c	1	*	fuck yeah!!
t1_dswmxxz	1	*	Oof, thats a diplomatic insult casus belli if Ive ever seen one. This will not, can not, stand
t1_dsxnwyz	0	*	That's part of it for sure. But women who are software developers earn less than men who are software developers. Why would that be?
t1_dswltu5	1	*	Tony Abbott also said 'shit happens' when asked what he thought about a soldier who had been killed in service
t1_dswhf85	1	*	Think he got Diversion or something.

t1_dtle4f5	1	*	I understand your point.
t1_dt89uuu	0	*	First of all there is a new attack today and in the past there were mortars fired. Are you really denying the pkk -ypg connection.
t1_dtdq11u	0	*	Because he joined in September 2016, has 80k karma, and is constantly posting collusion related articles so he can take a pro-Trump/Putin stance. You do the math...
t1_dtdy76d	1	*	Someone's upset.
t1_dtdyd7f	0	*	Idk most of my arguments are pretty solid. Maybe because I'm always right.
t1_duv2rfw	0	*	Some actually do.  Maybe you should speak with some homeless people.

t1_ds7lxhq	1	*	Not what I said. Not interested in wasting my time discussing with you however 
t1_ds7rvk1	1	*	You realize that there are many koreans who want to ban it? Its their genuine feeling, so stop linking this to Western cultural bias.
t1_ds7ldjm	1	*	>Plants arent conscious sentiment beings  Obviously someone hasn't had enough psilocybin in their life...
t1_ds7eind	0	*	Care to show your evidence that plants in fact cannot or do not feel pain?  I'm not suggesting they DO, but to claim they absolutely do not is a pretty bold statement.

t1_ds70nwm	1	*	It's an explanation, not an excuse. 
t1_ds7xm4w	0	*	Did you completely ignore every other point the documentary made because of one line of reasoning used at the start?
t1_duw7pbh	1	*	You voted for him because of his awesome campaign slogan.
t1_duxxijc	1	*	His followers are basically a brainwashed cult of people who can't think for themselves, so I wouldn't be surprised.
t1_duw05aj	1	*	I agree that anyone with a functioning brain will want ACTUAL sources and not just jerk off to a story because it feeds their tribal belief. This goes for people on either side of the spectrum. 
t1_duw7ss2	1	*	Yeah, the media was all over Trump, bashing him for everything. Little did they know they were literally helping him win.
t1_duw7hn2	0	*	How is it wasted? Why vote for somebody you don't want or the lesser of two evils, so to speak. Hillary still won in my state. 
t1_duw1hj1	1	*	Then you should say you don't *want* to believe it.  But a journalist with 5 sources is about as good as it gets.  But calling it fake news, is just a lie.  
t1_duw9c7k	0	*	You gave Republicans *way* too much credit.  No offense.
t1_duwhsfm	1	*	No sense responding to someone like you is is so biased and blind.  Best for me just to laugh at your ignorance and block you. 
t1_duwa9lk	0	*	Maybe, but to say they are equal is a bit false. I mean, canada isn't a utopia but its not as bad as the US.  if the US is a 3/10 then Canada is like a 4-4.5/10  At least imo.
t1_duw8hrq	0	*	Yeah he's making sacrifices for America and the world. Great guy.
t1_dux19na	1	*	Trump is allowing them to push through all their gifts to donors, that is the only thing that matters to them, if having literally the worst president ever gets them there that's the bus they take.
t1_duw9c4t	1	*	That's no true at all. Trump is the leader of the free world. The potheads thing though, yeah I totally agree with him, we need to do something drastic and different about potheads.
t1_duw93q7	1	*	Arkansan here.  I voted for Hillary but wanted Sanders.  Also, not a closet racist.

t1_dszmnys	0	*	Poorly structured if they can't pay living wages. If your company is so shite that it can't pay its people right, it deserves death, and fast.
t1_dszkxd1	0	*	Agreed, until minimum wage goes up again next year, and continues to adjust for inflation. Until we see basic income guarantee we'll probably never stop fighting corporations like Tim Hortons.

t1_dsj79b7	0	*	Geert Wilders used to be DVD!! He's not a liberal , he's a nationalistic capitalist. He just stole bits and pieces from left wing the campaignprogramm in order to attract left wing voters. 
t1_dsjjcki	1	*	You make a fair point. But I don't see how proclaimed socialism in Scandinavian countries is relevant to the discussion of how their press is freer  (according to this source, at least)

t1_dsjfe53	0	*	Maybe but they have a right to live here, immigrants don't. So the comparison is moot. We can only do something about incoming immigrants really.
t1_dsjf57e	1	*	Yes, I was talking about the Netherlands. The PVV is our second largest party and it ran on a platform that was just a few lines and half of those lines was dedicated to fucking over Muslims.

t1_dsjb353	1	*	Very far from perfect thats all Im going to say. You guys have the best beef jerky thats for sure. Everything else though: meh 
t1_dsjh2fe	0	*	My freedom of speech ends where someone else's rights begin. There's a lot I can say, but sometimes other rights weigh more.

t1_dsjdyc4	0	*	That's rich coming from someone on a default sub. Everything here is warped. Tweets are violence! 
t1_dsjtw30	0	*	Ah yes, because no-go zone should apply to a place where you can pass through but not live. Right.

t1_dsjk2rw	0	*	I'm from the states and I second this statement.
t1_dsjr1oo	0	*	So you don't have any shred of evidence to back up your claims, just like that lying politician. Got it.  Edit: spelling
t1_dsjizd3	0	*	Hard to see how
t1_dsk958n	1	*	Yeah fair enough.  I think you're wildly off with the safety comparison though, as someone who has lived in both areas.
t1_dskcnky	0	*	That's why I put 'maybe'.
t1_dskcdlq	1	*	All news is propoganda. The republicans just happen to go further with the lies.

t1_dsjjaqr	0	*	Yeah heaven forbid you look into the issue further yourself, if it's not on CNN or NY Times what's the point of even reading about it, amirite?
t1_dsjbf7b	1	*	When was there an honest, respectable Republican? Eisenhower?

t1_dsjus4p	0	*	And what do trumpets tell about them? Not your country, not your opinion. So they should sit down now.
t1_dsjk2a0	0	*	The press can't operate without money. They are therefore operated as corporations in a capitalist system. I truly wish it were as black and white as you state - but it's not.
t1_dsja0m7	0	*	what exactly defines 'tweeting like a mongrel'? Sounds like you're just annoyed.
t1_dsj7moo	0	*	Ah yes, the russians made people think this way.  You understand that this is poetically identical to saying Its the jews!!

t1_dsjdu7d	1	*	Protip: Kotakuinaction is where Nazis go to recruit.
t1_dsjec0w	0	*	I'm sure they'll try it again, just give it a few years. Seems to be the MO for large corporations these days, keep pushing and buying people in power until you get what you want.
t1_dsj84up	1	*	As someone outside the states, it's becoming increasingly easy to say, That's America for you 
t1_dsjg54d	1	*	and we have the lowest voter turnout of any western/modern/developed nation that has some form of democracy.

t1_dsjuz8z	0	*	Did Trump appoint him?
t1_dsjer1q	0	*	You as well friend!
t1_dsj8ood	0	*	Unless you live in a swing state your vote for president does not matter. That explains a lot of the low turnout. It's literally pointless for something like 80% or more of Americans.
t1_dsj8pzd	1	*	And how exactly are they supposed to change the system? Unless you're a billionaire, Americans have no power. Your arrogance is astounding.
t1_dsjc194	0	*	difference is the left wing extremists tend to get ignored, right wing extremists tend to get elected. 
t1_dsjhgu0	1	*	Nah, man...STEAK sauce! But yeah, those guys. https://www.amazon.com/Lea-Perrins-Bold-Steak-Sauce/dp/B00SNT20QC

t1_dsjf640	0	*	I don't have any personal reasons not to like him. I just don't like what he represents. Not the whole US but the current administration.
t1_dsjint5	1	*	Look, I'm down with any rich person who hurts our society being punished in extreme manners regardless of political orientation, but the topic at hand is current examples in the current government.
t1_dsiyt00	0	*	> legal to anyone.  Except they are not..
t1_dsjqfrq	1	*	I read the transcripts partly to be assured American reporters are hassling the White House in at least some ways.  Huckabee gets so angry when the reporters refuse to believe her crap.
t1_dsjrxgj	1	*	I'm sorry that you haven't been paying attention
t1_dsj943d	0	*	> liberals/democrats have a tendency to cut off their noses to spite their faces  everyone does. look at Trump's base?
t1_dskdhv4	1	*	*slow clap*

t1_dsjbxjv	0	*	Don't forget WILD CARDS that they label certain reviewers as.

t1_dsixc2h	1	*	Fair point, no more von Schlieffen.
t1_dsjee4q	1	*	I remember Gerstmann-gate.. I quit Gamespot after that and never went back. 
t1_dsjp3tb	1	*	Yeah sorry, misunderstanding on my behalf 
t1_dsjoxdd	0	*	Understood, I felt you had other implications.   My bad.   (Although, again, he specifically said, 'is an elected official'...)
t1_dsjb2d3	0	*	Who said I only vote for republicans? I vote based on who will get the job done better according to how I think. Of course the answer is nobody under the current status of our democracy.
t1_dsm414z	1	*	On the other hand, there probably are a sizeable number who genuinely believe that Europe has long become a caliphate state.
t1_dsj8mid	1	*	My other genes are Canadian so, after there is an escalation I apologize before the gloves drop. 
t1_dsjm46q	0	*	I prefer ^~~**my**~~ unions pulverised

t1_dslzikv	1	*	Never said too strict, just a bit stricter and were peachy, but right now I feel the police cant protect and serve because they are not allowed anything
t1_dsjt02f	1	*	You for sure should check out the national parks, they are dope
t1_dsjdbyg	1	*	This is my thought. Don't be rude, you still respect and love them. Just let it be known you're a conscious being. You're old enough to have kids to say that to.

t1_dskqvsz	1	*	Sure, I forgot I'm a redditor as well....
t1_dsjgv45	1	*	Just two decades ago people were complaining about the electoral college. It's a system that disproportionately helps Republicans, so they're not likely to change it any time soon. 
t1_dsjjhr7	0	*	Yes, but hard to prove.   It was a lie, but not something to just refuse over.
t1_dsjhf8f	1	*	> once facts got around about the low income tax breaks ending after 7 years  I thought it was after 5. Did that number change in the bill that got passed?

t1_dultcds	0	*	So what's your solution there? Higher-quality food that's produced at the same price and convenience of fast food somehow? That might take a magic wand.
t1_dunhcdy	1	*	Well not necessarily, one can give aid to the children in terms of heavily discounted baby food/cloths/toys etc - not just a flat some of money to the parents.
t1_dumjqtb	0	*	You want me to explain evolution to you?
t1_dum9zth	1	*	Most decent parents will give up their kids to the state before they let them die.
t1_dun5s48	1	*	its beyond fucking reason that it costs as much to rent an apartment as it is to buy a 250K house in here and pay mortgage.   wtf?
t1_dunkee8	1	*	You rang? 
t1_dumjo56	0	*	Listen I went to the first article on Google and it told me 46k there is no way I'm wrong on this ok?
t1_duls57c	1	*	So it seems like you dont know much about wealthy people and taxes at all
t1_dumlkm6	1	*	Though the UK has free healthcare. The US has cheaper cars and lower taxes.
t1_dumeags	0	*	just saying random things isnt very helpful 
t1_dun9fxo	1	*	Obviously, I never said they all would
t1_dumcxmf	1	*	Have fun finding them!
t1_dsojf4c	0	*	Its reasonable, but your trying to say the US does not give enough, even though we give the most money in a dollar amount. 
t1_dsp6ulm	1	*	The US isn't even close to representing half of the OECD population. 
t1_dspdq3c	0	*	How does that justify the illegal settlements? Who is actually currently taking land from Israel? As opposed to Israel regularly expanding their territory into Palestinian areas. 
t1_dspy4ry	0	*	Being a Jew is normally is not considered to be just a religious affiliation.  It is also a nationality - two nationalities I guess - Ashekazik and Sephardic. 
t1_dspbu9q	1	*	Of course we don't stop paying Israel billions of dollars to kill thousands of Palestinian civilians, right? 
t1_dsqeuf9	0	*	Thought fought multiple wars and lost. They forfeited the land when the decided to declare war. You dont put money into a lottery and ask for it back when you dont get the prize 
t1_dspe3er	0	*	If you want to stop, then stop. My problem is that the US is using the money for leverage to force a political victory in the UN. Do what we say or we'll let people starve is unconscionable. 
t1_dspd413	0	*	Israel has never reckognized Palestine or Palestine's right to exist.
t1_dspydhm	1	*	I am not going to argue that.
t1_dsq95v8	0	*	Curiously nobody seems to have an issue with the Vatican. Or any number of Muslim ~~shitholes~~ states. It's only the Jews having a state that seems to upset people.
t1_dsphq76	1	*	Right, I've heard many times that the US is greedy, selfish, uncaring, and so on. But Europeans are enlightened and noble, so they would surely pay for the refugees without complaint.
t1_dsorab6	1	*	They pay to protect their own interests. I'm sure this can be reduced significantly once you become completely subordinate to Russia. 
t1_dspdpev	0	*	That was over 60 years ago. How is it relevant today? 
t1_dspn0pm	1	*	So suicide bombers... Kamikaze pilots... insane people... or people who know they're beaten and have nothing to lose... they all care about survival?
t1_dspfy8x	0	*	The State department and US congress didn't regard them so after 1988...
t1_dspffoa	1	*	I'd consider myself an independent libertarian. There's nothing fiscally irresponsible about what I've said. 
t1_dsqax5a	0	*	Which really says all we need to know. You refuse to reckognize that there is a nation called Palestine. Shame on you.
t1_dspd39z	0	*	You kinda did by taking people's land without their permission.
t1_dspkuse	0	*	If it's in our genes and in your opinion we cannot possible not care about survival then why do people committ suicide?
t1_dsonkt5	0	*	In terms of this context it isn't. 
t1_dspdlc0	0	*	funny how they often forget this.
t1_dspbom0	1	*	True, but that was nearly 70 years ago. 
t1_dsoqmwb	1	*	We're not. Europeans are giving far more than Americans. If per capita doesn't make a difference all I have to do is pick a region with more people, right? 
t1_dspxfds	1	*	Yes, agree there. They're pretty much refugees in their own land.
t1_dsoql6i	0	*	I admire the mental gymnastics of praising the US for giving more while condemning other countries of taking more.
t1_dtm8d6o	1	*	My bad.
t1_ds2a9bf	1	*	Taiwan still claims to be China, so it's not independent from China, unless it somehow declares independence from itself (ROC) and PRC.  good luck with that.
t1_dv3xewi	0	*	If it happens enough to be median, they should not advertise otherwise. I don't think the reason it happens really matters, it does not justify what they represent.
t1_dv41mda	0	*	What's your logic? Because I never had it, I can never have it? 
t1_dv3p28q	1	*	Because if you agree on a certain distance or duration for x price per hour and the ride goes over you should be allowed to negotiate a new price/contract.
t1_dv433u4	0	*	> Guys get jealous when the girls not only look better then their women but they also have bigger cocks than them.  As a trans girl, I concur.
t1_dv4xhou	0	*	>You just up your price to cover it.  if everyone does this, then purchasing power decreases. This defeats the purpose of higher wages and benefits.
t1_dv4662e	1	*	Did he live to see the new pop. nazis march on American soil?
t1_dv46nm5	1	*	Some jobs do have unlimited overtime
t1_dv56zwh	0	*	Just the 20 part, but now I know about the charger, which is horrifying you even have.
t1_dv3rzrd	0	*	Oh that makes it okay
t1_dv4l77c	1	*	The credit thing sounds right. Thanks for the info
t1_dv4wu10	1	*	Aw man, your bits jingle? Mine are quiet. Pretty jealous
t1_dv1l3zq	0	*	If there were no Religion there would be no war is always fun to see here lol
t1_dv19a1r	1	*	Hitler was a super spirtural person. give me about an hour and I'll find the links   edit: there is a good documentary about Hitler and his influences from religion and spirituality 
t1_dv1a3eg	0	*	I am open minded in the sense that I'd accept a god if there was any evidence of its existence. To do otherwise is the definition of irrationality - the original point of my post.
t1_dv2okvf	0	*	No? Where the hell did I say that?
t1_du55m6e	0	*	Where are homosexuals mentioned in that at all? Unless homosexuality is considered a mental illness and a crime its just not relevant. 
t1_du6lxwz	1	*	oh ok. What score did I get on my homework?
t1_du5m5bz	0	*	What is supposed to be your point?  Rape is only bad if a muslim does it?
t1_du54t6i	1	*	Yeah I would also like to know at what point making fun of sociologists makes me a nazi please
t1_dur6u0l	0	*	350 million+ firearms in the US and 7-8 thousand homicides a year. Do the math.
t1_dus184r	0	*	they just shoot the 5.56 NATO round also used in the AR-15.
t1_dus79ue	1	*	Honestly, if a European is actually watching US politics with interest, they probably know more than the average American just purely because they're paying attention. 
t1_dut1l5n	1	*	you're naive af if you think that wasn't written to give the impression Trump needs and asked for advice on gun control. If it were just a sentence in the article then sure, but it was the headline.
t1_durm5jx	1	*	I too believe that everyone who disagrees with me belongs to X negative stereotype.
t1_dusbgqp	0	*	No I prefer to make money
t1_durcrdq	1	*	Because the military was so effective against people with small arms in Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iraq, and the multitude of other guerilla wars in the past century. 
t1_dusbw55	0	*	Doesn't mean shit cause you can get pinned magazines anyways if you wanted to commit a mass shooting. Lots of guns are sold with pinned mags also.
t1_durgt8r	0	*	Oh, we dont need to differentiate?  Sounds good to me, good luck passing anything around removing all firearms in the US
t1_dur99lj	0	*	Actually, Australia's murder rate has dropped from 1.6 per 100k in 1997 to 1 in 100k last year.  Aside from 1999, the murder rate dropped consistently after the regulations were implemented.
t1_dusqfi9	0	*	That would legit start a civil war. Seriously. 
t1_duvnz3k	0	*	Nope.  That's 100% wrong.  Want to bother addressing all the other points, or are you going to admit that you're wrong.
t1_durclnp	0	*	Tell that to every single enemy we've fought since the Korean War. 
t1_durlxen	0	*	Yes its called actually living in America. Believe it or not opinions on the news and internet dont accurately portray a day/week/month/year in the life of someone who spends everyday on our soil.
t1_durrbum	0	*	Why? 
t1_durdev5	1	*	you are wrong, for obvious reasons.
t1_dus4342	1	*	You too sir 
t1_dur781o	0	*	Actually in American schools it's   The bullet -----> your head.
t1_duw8kgc	0	*	I think it's a bizarre double-standard to act like that's welcome given how happy Europeans are to get political input from Americans in domestic policies.
t1_duresd7	1	*	That wasn't a mass shooting. It was a bank robbery by well armed guys. 
t1_durltlq	0	*	Progressivism in the United States is a particular political movement. One that does not and did not involve radical Christian fundamentalists. Maybe take a US history class?
t1_dur7ce3	0	*	Oh the irony 
t1_duru8uo	1	*	Go to a 3 gun match and watch as the people who are disqualified for being too slow are more quick and accurate than Police.
t1_duu6bgr	1	*	That would still show up as homicide, whether justifiable (ie legal) or not. We know it wasn't that.
t1_durxme1	1	*	Some say that when Australia is in its time of greatest need, he shall rise up from the sea to save us all.
t1_dus3dpj	1	*	So it's only a broken system this time? Not the previous 2 presidential elections? What about in the Senate and Congress? Is it broken at the state level currently? How about the county level?
t1_duszexu	1	*	Yeah, your prior approaches to gun control have been so fucking stupid they haven't worked.  Marco Rubio said it better than I ever could: We need to stop looking at loopholes
t1_durl4ju	0	*	As soon as your choice stops ruining TV shows, news, comedy, general conversation, the internet....then yes.  
t1_dusopsb	0	*	Sure, but youre the one going door to door to collect them.
t1_dusjgwn	1	*	You might be right. I do feel like history only remembers the big events, though. 
t1_durtujc	1	*	Only 2/3 haha
t1_duryuso	0	*	Nice strawman argument.  Where did I say they should give all their guns back?  I showed 3 examples of mass shootings.  According to basic mathematics, which is larger 0 or 1?  
t1_durr3jz	0	*	As an American I'd say they know more, we're startlingly ignorant of politics as a country, we treat it like we're watching football. 
t1_durlr2f	1	*	But youve a whole foot already!
t1_durri78	0	*	Maybe Americans should learn something from other countries that have solved your problems rather than dismiss them.
t1_dur96uc	1	*	Gun controll isnt about punishing gun owner's it's about protecting lives.  You feeling a little oppressed isn't comparable to *attempting* to save lives
t1_dus8y1v	1	*	Please be intellectually honest and respond to khjhk. 
t1_durckpt	1	*	The only result of armed citizens is them being targeted more by the military if there is ever an uprising in America again.
t1_durk5md	1	*	Quite a generalization there.
t1_durkcbb	1	*	Those revolts were failures to be sure, but they actually tried to wage a conventional war to my knowledge. Not a guerrilla campaign that would have been more effective.
t1_durpuwt	0	*	Im pretty sure with all the pro troop fuckery now a days they could repeal the 3rd amendment if they really tried
t1_durof4v	0	*	Of course. You all are so enlightened.
t1_durr8xj	1	*	in some categories, like foreign policy, they very well may, because they see it up close.  that same situation applies oppositely to pretty much all domestic issues though.
t1_dusgp6x	0	*	> giving people free healthcare  Healthcare is a privilege, not a right.
t1_durji38	0	*	Super easy. Happens every day. 
t1_durqzaj	0	*	The constitution doesn't grant rights, only enumerates them.
t1_dur78hy	0	*	Yeah because I said any of that.
t1_durjr2b	0	*	Why do you think we all did those surveys on how many five year olds we could fight?
t1_dusvgpf	1	*	Fair enough. I need to do a more rigorous look into what each of them actually accomplished. I know the thing he got sacked over wasn't really morally important if I remember right
t1_durlmt2	0	*	It's already a thing.   Donald Trump has made it a point to denounce American money and influence in anything foreign.   You're cool with that, right?
t1_durxdot	0	*	If no one but the government can afford to go against the government, what's the point of the 2A then?
t1_durissk	0	*	> You make me sick  Uh oh here comes the emotional argument
t1_durm8g0	1	*	Cool.  You are no longer permitted to own guns, speak freely, worship as you wish, protect your home or property from search or seizure, or obtain a jury trial.  Poof  Corruption gone from your life. 
t1_durkvz1	1	*	Thanks for the correction, I got them mixed up. 
t1_duso1w8	1	*	> Meaning, in order to be even comparable we'd need to have 60 mass shooting events for every one of Norway's.  The US has had well over 60 mass shooting events since 2009. 
t1_dury2cr	0	*	So you would rather that only the very richest can afford those weapons?
t1_durjpav	0	*	My guns you turd. Explain how I'm meant to protect MY kids without them! 
t1_durct2r	0	*	You seem to be missing the fact that Colombia and Mexico have massive gun control as well. How is that working out for the law abiding citizens?
t1_dutftyr	1	*	'Traditional values'...ok makes sense now. This isnt the 1950s champ.
t1_dusufv3	1	*	Which ones?
t1_duef583	0	*	I gotta go now. Thor is on. Gotta put on the same garb as my ancestors and have a white male only screening. But have fun having a meltdown about everything. 
t1_duecqq8	1	*	That's kind of the point why Asgard keeps in fighting for Midgard, exactly because of their duty to stick together in the face of adversity.
t1_dudoc0o	1	*	So movies with only white people are divisive?
t1_dudo367	0	*	And a lot of non-whites have never met a full-blown white-supremacist, doesn't make seeing it online any less I infuriating.
t1_dudovzm	0	*	Yeah, of course you did.
t1_dudva6s	0	*	Word. For. Word.  Tell me something you enjoy that isn't political. Think of it as a mental exercise.
t1_dueda4x	1	*	I thiiink you're correct. There where a few establishing shots with a hip hop sound track I vaguely recall, but yeah I think that you're right in that that was their intended metaphor. 
t1_dtwue6q	1	*	Stop proving to everyone else that Americans are retarded and hopelessly isolated.
t1_dtaew96	0	*	That doesn't relate to what I just said. Nice job trying to dodge my statement. 
t1_du9d6ql	0	*	Did Israel demolish the house of Yigal Amir?  Or is their policy of house demolition only related to the families of Palestinian militants?
t1_du9fe80	1	*	Are you implying I am denying the Armenian genocide? Because I am not. I am denying that it was a Jewish conspiracy.
t1_du9htwu	1	*	Yes, a lot. Do you think there's anything wrong with being a Jew?
t1_du9ls14	1	*	Yep, I agree with that.
t1_duadwf6	1	*	Bruh what propaganda are you spewing on reddit. Im reporting you to the local police 
t1_du96p8g	1	*	I only mentioned it because the guy who I replied to did 
t1_dsuvbt8	1	*	Maybe not, as he said he voted in protest. Edit; see response
t1_dty4njt	0	*	> Questions such as?  What is the meaning of life? What is the purpose of my existence and the hardships I face? What happens to my (mind/soul) after death?
t1_dt7dase	1	*	Oh it was an attempt at a joke, heh good one 
t1_dt79ds8	0	*	You know now you've officially branded yourself as an ass and the bad guy to readers of this thread right?
t1_ds3mhsw	0	*	Such a stupid conversation from these two just because ravenraven didn't understand a joke comment.
t1_duo4tz8	0	*	Forgive me for not feeding the obvious troll.
t1_duo490v	1	*	Except under Duterte people have been gunned down in the street, either by police, or literal fucking vigilante death squads. 
t1_ds8issq	0	*	Eh it's just Reddit man, no vitriol needed
t1_dtgbdrs	0	*	how many people have been federally fucking indicated now? I lost count.
t1_dv0463h	0	*	You know, most of the time I can get the reference by the 2nd or 3rd comment chain, but I officially have no fucking clue what the kids are talking about these days.
t1_dv0bw19	1	*	Thanks! I'll bookmark it for future use.
t1_duziv8n	0	*	He admitted to firing Comey to stop the Russia stuff. Trump is not that smart.
t1_duzkiam	0	*	Which j-  All of it.  *All* of it?  *All* of it. All the justice. The justice, the whole justice, and nothing but the justice.  Wow.  Yeah.
t1_dv0m4fm	1	*	Executive privilege.
t1_duzefew	0	*	Yeah, he would never be stupid enough to talk about why obstructing justice is the real reason he did that to Lester Holt... waitaminute
t1_duzkeo9	1	*	I wouldnt put it past him. He admitted he fired Comey for the investigation.
t1_dv09ywh	0	*	Two of the guilty pleas were actually about lying to investigators regarding collusion. Flynn and Papa. 
t1_dv0my4p	1	*	Let me clarify.  People who name their kids Abcde think it's pronounced Absodee. The kids think so, too.  I don't think that.
t1_duzp4rq	1	*	He said on a national television interview that he fired Comey because of that Russia business, so it isn't inconceivable. 
t1_duzn4q2	0	*	I have never seen cobras riding jet-skis equipped with laser-guns before.   Thank you.
t1_dt1j6l2	0	*	Do you really think legalizing cocaine and heroin is a solution?

t1_dt1yyya	0	*	So you admit the comparison is retarded in the first place?
t1_dt1iawi	1	*	These drugs have been catapulting Mexicans for years!
t1_dt1r4ix	0	*	People who come on airplanes have to clear immigration.  Those who sneak across the boarder don't, so that's the route the people we least want (criminals) take.
t1_dt1uh19	1	*	Neither of those show statistics. All cities have crime. I never said there was no crime. I said there was no Cancun cartel and there isn't.  Obviously people will sell drugs in a touristic city
t1_dt2cx7f	0	*	> It's currently working for Hungary and Israel.   there are a shit ton of illegal immigrants in Israel. you have no idea what you are talking about. 
t1_ds586bq	1	*	Actually, its pretty apt
t1_ds6pmpg	1	*	The article & the other ones linked mention they've closed it in this manner before, and it's not AI, rather some form of automated expert system.
t1_duhxnkl	1	*	This, exactly. 
t1_duhz49k	0	*	What about people who are working?
t1_dui5bk7	1	*	Yeah its shit.  I earn what I consider to be good money - many wouldnt, Im sure.  I cant really afford to support us both - wed be better off if we both earned half of my income each (tax screws me)
t1_duhylze	0	*	>Because 51.89%*  of those who actually voted, good lord that hurts to think about.
t1_dui16pe	1	*	To like 8 people. It's the inevitable end to a system that rewards hoarding money and power.
t1_duijq9o	0	*	Because everyone knows all muslims are a hive mind waiting to be activated by Muhammad  when they will kill everyone else and declare sharia law over the land....

t1_dui13cy	0	*	An almost 4% difference in a vote with record breaking turnout is pretty damn decisive
t1_dui3384	1	*	It may be an echo foam, interconnected echo bubbles in a larger structure.
t1_duhzm48	0	*	Automation is for the rich so they can cut jobs and save money. All the money they make from it goes to them. Then they continue to hoard  money. 
t1_dui1cm1	1	*	Interestingly I read a study a while back that blamed women for long term salary drops the explain this. Doubling the workforce caused downward pressure on salaries.
t1_dui0bmp	0	*	The vast majority of humanity lived in what would be considered extreme poverty today. People are better off now more than they ever have been by an amazing margin. 
t1_duikyfl	0	*	Move to the USA...we catch a lot of hate on reddit. But, you are still going to take home much more of your paycheck and you CAN afford housing (at least compared to in/around London.) 
t1_dui0vua	1	*	The ownership of production is shrinking. So fewer business owners, fewer people owning or sharing in what they produce. 
t1_dui0r7r	0	*	I thought you just said you didnt have a job? And why do you keep calling everybody jobless millennials? Projecting much, lol?
t1_duhzimh	0	*	we haven't caught up with the fact that the goal is for us to no longer work, so we don't give lazy people any money even though they aren't working through no necessary fault of their own.

t1_dui1nk0	0	*	They are making assumptions based on stats and trends. Of course they cannot know that you've had it great. There will be exceptions in everything.
t1_duhxla5	0	*	Guilty
t1_duhxmkl	1	*	underrated comment right here  
t1_dui3atd	1	*	Indeed, people are even under the impression the bank lends anything and that they do risk analysis instead of proving to a regulator they did risk analysis to dig out those loans out of nothing.

t1_dui1vc0	1	*	Idk the process, but unemployment checks are definitely real.
t1_duil77x	1	*	I didn't demonize working folks single method of protecting themselves, getting fair wages, and good insurance plans.  That's for sure.

t1_dui1y52	0	*	I think it is due generally to the difference between money as a receipt for goods and services and money as debt.

t1_duio7pa	0	*	Part of why unions in Germany work that way is businesses negotiate in good faith with unions there. Here in the US... not so much. So the unions have zero incentive to cooperate.
t1_dui2t65	1	*	When describing the context of their job, it's pretty negative.

t1_dui0piq	0	*	When was that ever the case? Even if the man was doing all the work out in the fields and such the woman and children were full at work as well.
t1_duk2p67	1	*	Yeah. Or Sweden. Sold iron ore to first the axis powers, then the allies. Built a welfare state on having the most non-bombed industry in europe after the war.

t1_duhzjf5	1	*	*Physical labor is only for kids, and kids don't need / deserve to be paid a living wage.*  /not even alt right

t1_dui54uk	1	*	http://money.cnn.com/gallery/news/economy/2017/01/06/obama-economy-10-charts-final/4.html  I disagree. You can say he didn't help them enough, but his policies very clear helped. 
t1_dui5uoj	0	*	Well he pasted that statement to show how retarded your argument was. So well done, you just agreed that your argument was retarded.   If only we could work together politically this well. 
t1_duih3uh	0	*	The point is rich people most often get rich by indirectly larger usage of the services taxes pay for. If they use it more, shouldn't they pay more for them?

t1_dukooxg	1	*	Good deflection bud. I am American, so I'm pretty familiar with the brand of hard set political beliefs I was referring to. I encounter the lack of constructive political discussion on a weekly basis.
t1_dui167x	0	*	I've heard the argument that when women joined the workforce, that doubled the size of labor; therefore, wages halved.

t1_dtsplkc	0	*	They doesn't understand that even though you are conservative and religious, you don't want to force everyone to do what you want. If they are American (like me), I can totally understand why.
t1_dtt3t0x	0	*	Agree with your last point. Religion and learning are not at odds by definition. That wasn't what I was trying to say.  Religious government is though, and very much so in Iran.

t1_dtsukpt	0	*	But theyre selected by an appointed representative *council*!  ...the Electoral College is, like, *totes* different
t1_dtsu6ao	0	*	Technically they are not allowed to do that to non-mus. My friend lived there around 2010 and his wife did not have to wear it.   EDIT: They still have to cover up from the neck up tho.
t1_dtsvp0q	1	*	Michelle Obama and Angela Merkel both did not wear headscarves while visiting Saudi Arabia

t1_dtt24tn	1	*	Yes, this. 
t1_dtsxaet	0	*	If the FBI-NSA-DNC-FISA Court did as much as they have to prevent and then unseat an elected president, imagine what Iran does.  Their leader is not elected.

t1_dtt1kn4	0	*	Huge difference between modesty in religious terms esp. in Islam & modesty as it is understood in the West. 
t1_dtu3nlt	0	*	Women are having their insides regulated and held hostage by a bunch of Christian men in the US.  Doesn't have to be a straight 1-1 comparison of oppression to be a parallel.  Are you a Christian?
t1_dttdlwd	1	*	And in the end it doesn't stand for piety. There are brothels where women go to their clients in hijab so that no one would bother them or ask them where they are going if they are wearing the hijab.
t1_du5pthe	1	*	I thought the same passages Muslims used are the same Christians use. They read the old testament too. It says men will square the corners of their beards and women will cover their heads.

t1_dtt170j	0	*	So does that mean that Iran is the Brazil of the Middle East?
t1_dtszmxn	0	*	Rouhani is considered a moderate yes, but the overall system is ruled by Islamists with a Supreme Leader at the top chosen by a religious Guardian Council. 
t1_dtt9xza	0	*	Do you think the sanctions are unfair?
t1_dtstjn2	1	*	Right I agree
t1_dtszx0u	1	*	They didnt seem to, they did. All of this frustration we feel from Russias interference, imagine it x10 and then your country descends into civil war. Not pretty. 
t1_dtszgco	0	*	Then your point makes no sense as how much clothing costs or what brand they are have nothing to do with modesty.
t1_dtssthr	1	*	GOT EM!

t1_dtsu3q5	0	*	I think it's time the West stood up for its own values at home and abroad. At least some of our ways are better. Let's be proud of what we have accomplished.

t1_du3dpn9	1	*	The first mistake is your attempt at reading my sentence.  (and completely missing the point like a stormtrooper)
t1_du53hsf	1	*	yea I agree, thats the main reason he won the primary. I think him being a fake populist and saying he was anti establishment won him the general

t1_duc2fpp	0	*	You forgot to call the refugees the *real* monsters because they share a religion with extremists.
t1_ds16516	1	*	The USD is also a controlled kind of inflation -- it's just a question of who is controlling that inflation. Bitcoin has set one standard, USD will use another.
t1_ds1p73t	1	*	My point was that banks make money all the time, rendering OPs comment moot. And I wasn't implying that inflation is a bad thing. 
t1_ds17oq3	0	*	So fiat currencies lend themselves better to consumerism. I wouldn't call that healthy.

t1_dtkzovf	0	*	Because that's how war works with massive countries that are hugely powerful.
t1_dtlktad	1	*	Your point is that we have a casus beli to invade any country with a lower standard of living than us?  There are a lot of countries that I wouldn't move too.    Also NK doesn't have serfs.
t1_dt1mqcd	0	*	So what?
t1_dt2bsix	1	*	It's about tax cuts for billionaires. They can't repeal parts of Obamacare or implement the tax giveaway to the Koch brothers with simple reconciliation.

t1_ds656kz	0	*	OP made a claim without evidence.  I asked a question.  You are chewing me out and not OP.  I conclude you have a bend.  My mind is still open by the way.  Feel free to post some evidence.
t1_ds3wyh5	1	*	Qui peut dire?
t1_dsyw0wr	0	*	Haha yeah. I'm sure they referenced debenhams in the old one though. Bit confusing. 
t1_dsza6nx	1	*	Dont worry, youre not entirely to blame for the wall go shame!!
t1_dsypmdi	1	*	How so? You guys are the ones running around putting the pieces together like some damn pizzagaters. 
t1_dunlyww	1	*	Because I don't hope that it won't break, I know its limit. Goes more under common sense on them and really they're stronger than they look. Nor I want to carry a bag.
t1_dundomz	1	*	I associate colored ribbon paper straws with being a kid and drinking cereal milk.
t1_dunfgtg	1	*	That's totally fair. There is a difference however, between medical necessity and using a straw just because that's what one prefers.
t1_duncum0	1	*	I think youre just smelling the metal because youre getting your face close to it. Rather than a fork brought up to your mouth. 
t1_dunfmin	0	*	I dont think this is butter, it's too white. It looks more like cream cheese to me.
t1_dunrkkh	1	*	Rant received and appreciated. I agree. I don't want my Pepsi tasting like cherry and lemon lime.
t1_dunfhsc	1	*	It really is 
t1_duo9bw5	0	*	It doesn't matter, it's just paper
t1_dunghv2	0	*	well i've never done litter picking but i walk past fields and parks and don't see any litter really.
t1_duooinb	1	*	I don't think you know what naxefve means...
t1_dunj8iq	1	*	Damn I just went down a rabbit hole of weird cult shit. Thank you for the sad but entertaining history lesson 
t1_dunhelg	1	*	That's great and all, but there's no way I'd remember to bring a straw with me everywhere I go...
t1_duo6aca	1	*	Yeah, I'm not going to carry straws around, just like I don't carry empty bags around. Also I'm not cleaning straws, all my straws will be single use.
t1_dunfgit	0	*	Suck down some milkshakes thru a hotdog
t1_duncxb8	0	*	Vegan dude at my job has one, used the same straw for 8 years and counting. 
t1_duncs2a	0	*	Whether you like it or not you will eventually be forced to stop driving once autonomous cars hit a large enough share of the market. No one will insure a human when robots are much safer 
t1_duu38wq	1	*	Haha puns are great.
t1_dune3hp	0	*	Only setback is the germs
t1_duoc6yn	1	*	They might if there was more demand for it. 
t1_dunhnqu	1	*	Technically could, practically probably wouldn't happen. Also metal seems kind of hard, especially since I tend to bite my straws.
t1_dunbafk	0	*	Probably one of the things I hated most in the army. Metal drinking cups. Milk became terrible to drink.
t1_dunep66	0	*	>Where does this come from?  racism , duh
t1_dunlj22	0	*	I know I'm not the only one who drinks a smoothie from the glass. It's just easier for me.
t1_dunmb6d	1	*	Oh your post was rhetorical?
t1_duosqc5	0	*	So... bringing food containers back home is no issue but a straw is? :D 
t1_dunncbi	1	*	No one in India uses it. Drinking from can would be considered cooler actually. 
t1_dunepx7	0	*	I have one of these and it's fine for liquids, but how do you clean the inside of the tumbler straw after having a raspberry/blackberry shake? I never feel like it's clean enough.
t1_dund8jr	1	*	Paper works for like, 30 mins before it goes soggy soft.
t1_dunz3li	1	*	In the touristy places that sell food, they have small sections where you can stand and eat there. There also have announcements not to eat and walk at the same time haha.
t1_duo65b3	0	*	Bamboo straws are much more of a problem than plastic, starting with the bamboo.
t1_dunimzy	1	*	Damit, the world needs more Irish and Canadians
t1_duo1xyc	1	*	No doubt.
t1_dttqpaw	0	*	>if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally  Except this is another lie. Show me evidence for this. 
t1_dtt5cc0	1	*	Exactly which is my point responding to the two people saying he was qualified and that anyone who says otherwise is just biased.
t1_dttld3g	0	*	I'd laugh so hard if Trump took a CAE exam and failed.
t1_dtub57h	1	*	So basically he fooled you once, shame on you... he tried to fool you twice, can't get fooled again.
t1_dtubwbq	0	*	> Highlighting Trump's inability to testify without selfharm is an admission of guilt.  Guilt of what? 
t1_dtupslc	1	*	More rhetorical, I guess.  Same reason they wont vote against themselves to move away from the two-party system.
t1_dtu6rhk	0	*	Definitely. That's why Trump talking to Mueller gives me a weird chub.
t1_dttswly	0	*	So you want to build a future with these people while also blaming them (which tells me you don't understand them)?
t1_dttmx59	1	*	> for some reason  Money. Final answer
t1_dttzl9m	1	*	Kudos, not that it's a necessity for me but it's nice to see someone trying to avoid the most obvious partisan pitfalls.
t1_dtv53gg	1	*	Haha, I think many people would agree he has that childish quality
t1_dttq5t7	0	*	It's a sad state of affairs when lying has to be re-phrased to be non-partisan
t1_dtu6ime	1	*	It's not a lie but it is delusional. 
t1_due9faq	0	*	Why hasn't Trump indicted Soros, since he's the boogie man you claim?
t1_dt7z80d	1	*	Glad that I could help...I'll show myself out now....  AS Dad used to say.. If you can't be handsome, at least be memorable.   Jim b. 
t1_ds8ct5t	0	*	So? That doesn't mean anyone wants to increase the costs of keeping track of these weapons by destabilizing Pakistan.
t1_ds83s7h	1	*	A nuclear weapon seems like a good way to get a large pile of cash.
t1_ds7eca9	0	*	Youre supposed to check the sources dude. This is basic research stuff. 
t1_ds7kg5m	0	*	I dont know about that but US had issued them legal documents and they openly walked around and paid American businesses for good, services and training.    
t1_ds7wdap	1	*	Yeah, we saw what happened the last you tried assembling jets and missiles  Yes we did. Pakistan started producing its own jets and missiles. How is this conducive to your poin?
t1_ds7t7vv	1	*	The dawn is mostly correct, but you seem seem to be misinterpreting what they've shown and said, especially when it comes to the CPEC leaks in question.
t1_ds7s7bf	0	*	Yeah, no. Again, this is just a plain nonsense comment.
t1_ds7ej9s	1	*	Yes, more than one
t1_ds7fq1n	0	*	Yup, that's a great way to get invaded.  Quick, fast and in a hurry ... By multiple countries.
t1_ds8sw01	0	*	KJU successfully managed to piss off both US and China though
t1_ds7eztq	1	*	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_Lebanon#Religious_population_statistics  54% Islam (Shia and Sunni, 27% each)
t1_ds8gpfh	1	*	Already done. 
t1_ds7vy5x	1	*	There sure are a lot of gullible alarmists on Reddit.
t1_ds7d37d	0	*	Culturally interfaith marriages are a huge issue for most religious people.  If a girl from the Bible Belt marries a Muslim, her parents aren't gonna be too happy about that either.
t1_ds8anbm	0	*	First of all, it's spelled *ridiculous*    Second of all, quantity doesn't matter- quality does. And every single one of us has a valid point.    Third, if you don't like it, go <censored> yourself.

t1_ds7j41l	0	*	Hairspray no longer contains chloroflourocarbons and thus can no longer contribute to ozone depletion. There aren't actually that many things that contain CFCs anymore.  
t1_ds7jfew	1	*	His personality is killing the ozone layer. 
t1_ds9ah6x	1	*	Theyll still do it in the other places too, so its still a net gain in the amount of pollution.
t1_ds7q0ph	0	*	Im getting flashbacks to college thermodynamics. 
t1_ds7oy7u	0	*	Yeah, with absolutely no experimentation at all you can not guarantee anything but okay.    
t1_ds7ntxc	0	*	Also the heavy tanker wont have to spend all of that fuel transporting the oil.
t1_ds7q0ze	0	*	You had me until particular's 
t1_ds7ued0	1	*	Our tories arent any better though U0001f644  Why do people have to be such twats :(
t1_ds7jhq5	1	*	its all a matter of perspective. Those cancer cells need help, they don't just grow themselves you know !  (actually, yes, they do really..)
t1_ds7hscy	0	*	So we must destroy Google.
t1_ds7kv3k	1	*	OK, got my groupings wrong. Thx
t1_ds7oaa4	0	*	Google doesn't work well for acronyms unless you already know the context pretty well.  See for example the wikipedia disambiguation page for [HFC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HFC).

t1_ds7llz7	0	*	yes...let the hate flow through you.
t1_ds7luzj	0	*	saudi flooding the market and end of iran sanctions to be exact  the drop in price was supply glut not demand drop off
t1_ds7po0x	1	*	It does produce quite a bit of greenhouse gases though 
t1_ds8rk1t	0	*	[Don't worry, this guy already went over that, much to my chagrin.](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/7o6stz/new_measurement_confirms_the_ozone_is_coming_back/ds7na3m/)
t1_ds7jemk	0	*	Woosh
t1_ds82glo	1	*	Millions of us would survive if all the Nukes would be detonated at once. The following Nuclear Winter would be problematic, but humanity would survive in specific pockets and spread out over time.
t1_ds7ucqw	1	*	No this is #ADVANCED WHEATHERING
t1_ds8x8j3	1	*	The first half of your statement may be true. But the second half just makes you sound like an ass.
t1_ds7ywwu	0	*	Actually they would boil. The water on Earth is only kept liquid due to the pressure of the atmosphere above it. 
t1_ds7nujw	1	*	Insert joke about trumps hair here 
t1_ds7tpv7	1	*	You say that like He Hate Me was a bad thing tbh
t1_ds7ise0	1	*	Until they come out with HFHCFCCS.
t1_ds96fyh	0	*	Right, like disregarding someones opinion who supports a pathological liar with dementia.  Very messed up. 
t1_ds7jucc	1	*	I think what Donald was trying to say is that since he uses a fuckton of hairspray in closed room, and he's not dead from it, ozone can't be hurting anything.
t1_ds7po71	1	*	Jesus never left the house without his hairspray. Using anything else means you're a godless heathen. 
t1_dsav72a	0	*	Here's hoping you don't ever come back.
t1_ds7naoe	0	*	No he didn't actually. He took about half the holidays that bush did and a little more than clinton. By comparison trump has barely been in office
t1_ds7qj87	1	*	Casinos are used to launder money. His mob ties should have made them even more profitable.
t1_ds943ju	1	*	No amount of nukes would remove the natural gravitational force Earth has on gasses. We wouldn't;t lose the atmosphere, just irradiate it.
t1_ds7ui0x	1	*	I wonder how many reactor techs leave the US Navy every year and don't go on to work at civilian reactor sites.
t1_ds7jkjm	0	*	you would have to have hair to do that...   that is definitely a wig.
t1_ds7k9o0	0	*	Sadly, I feel fear will always prevent nuclear energy from becoming more prominent.
t1_ds7rs7c	0	*	i purposefully missed the amount. I simply stated the face that in most cases fuel is burned to ship oil. i purposely did not state amounts or efficiency or burn efficiency.
t1_ds7pp5g	0	*	Yeah casinos can be pretty risky, especially if the economy takes a nosedive
t1_ds7mk27	1	*	Yeah that's what I figured. Now I need to go look up how plastic is made from the start.
t1_ds7iapx	0	*	Not if the repair is occurring too slowly
t1_ds7pwaj	1	*	See my reply above. Happy to provide more detail if youre interested. 
t1_ds7tdg2	0	*	Oh, you sweet Summer child 
t1_ds7riwb	1	*	I read once that one shipping ship produces as much greenhouse gas as 500,000 cars per year.... there are costs beyond dollars  Pretty amazing it's only $5 to ship a barrel
t1_ds7m76l	0	*	Which is the exact opposite of the direction we need to be going.
t1_ds7h4qg	1	*	Just like trump 
t1_ds8gawt	1	*	Train wrecks, bud.  What theyd really need are pipe lines but we all know how that works out.  Bottom line is that the Middle East is already well versed and equipped to get that oil over there. 
t1_ds7v1kc	0	*	Still, the odds of actual humans (as we know them/us) evolving again are practically zero. But yeah you're right, none of this is a likely scenario.
t1_ds7mx3e	0	*	Exactly. They'll even each other out, and we should probably expect drilling to continue both here and elsewhere.
t1_ds7p9rt	0	*	No, you actually have no idea what you are talking about. 
t1_ds7m9fz	0	*	Well, I rather like this one. Can we keep this one livable?
t1_ds7ta98	1	*	The asteroid that caused the chain reaction leading to the extinction of dinosaurs is estimated to be at 10,000 times the Earths current nuclear arsenal.  Youre going to need to up those numbers.
t1_ds8wg5m	1	*	Nah my bad I didn't notice which subreddit. r/science and r/worldnews have quite different expectations.
t1_ds976or	0	*	That sounds like your problem. 
t1_ds7zt2z	0	*	Well I mean, the Earth will naturally change climates into something that will kill us. We're just speeding that process up. 
t1_dsq4v4e	0	*	I'm talking every day usage. With that definition, nothing will ever be miraculous.
t1_dsq7ro5	1	*	Frankly, I think people should give it a pass when it comes to life and death situations. You can reverse almost any situation but you can't bring back a dead person.
t1_dt6i8gp	1	*	An FCC that isn't corrupt.
t1_duigapc	0	*	Yeah and I just stated that thats par for the course in global markets. 
t1_duimg2v	0	*	> There have been some studies that suggested there were medical reasons, but they have since been debunked.  [Really?](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3139859/)
t1_dukmtsj	1	*	See there, true stripes!
t1_duoabg9	0	*	Fuck man. Sounds like they botched the job badly. I'm very sorry to hear this.  I can see the frustration seeing that this is a totally cosmetic procedure that messed you up unnecessarily.
t1_duiqcjy	1	*	Uh...that's not the 'ideal'. Ideally we'll all live in peace and harmony with intact genitalia.  :)
t1_duirjq5	0	*	You're just being sneaky. Let them choose later is really an underhanded way to eliminate the possibility. Prevent parents form passing on their traditions, and those traditions cannot continue.
t1_duida7v	0	*	> Circumcised boys take longer, some much much longer if at all.  More ignorant nonsense? This isn't true.
t1_dt2bb5p	0	*	50000 Kurdish women and children butchered in the 1990s is hardly bullshit. 
t1_duek4x2	0	*	False. Gott mit uns, multiple addresses to Creator and he made a deal with the Catholic Church. He was a Christian.
t1_due5gdy	1	*	I like that you skip from Ten Commandments to Jesus. Because you don't really know what's in between probably.
t1_dueefdp	0	*	This statistic is practically useless unless you compare it to previous popes. Of course Catholics like the Pope. 
t1_duern13	0	*	You really think there has only been one instance of child rape over the course of the religion?
t1_due5jbq	0	*	The ten commandments don't say anything about rape. Neither does Jesus.
t1_duefb0j	1	*	In other words, you can't answer his question lol
t1_dufnt3q	1	*	29% of abusers interviewed said that they were abused themselves. Compared to a random control group who were not abusers. 14% experienced abuse.
t1_duf5sd7	1	*	Oh what the fuck... Now this whole conversation is off the rails.  Anyway thank you for clarifying and sorry for putting words in your mouth.
t1_due7598	1	*	Oh for sure he sounds nuts, though he could be right on this and wrong on that.   He's not, though.
t1_duektbr	1	*	I know it only been two hours, so they both may respond still... But I feel like you won the internet for today. Here's one upshmeckle. It's all I have.
t1_dug5v86	0	*	You are not as good at this as you think you are.
t1_due51nn	0	*	actually its a systematic problem across the entire church and the entire religion is tainted because of it. gotta throw all of catholicism away.
t1_dueysy0	1	*	The pope enables child rape. Full stop.
t1_duefbcx	1	*	Dodging the question does not paint your belief in a good light. It fact it shines a huge spotlight on how shallow and destructive that view is.
t1_dueds5z	0	*	What do Muslims have to do with Catholic child diddlers?
t1_duec4ri	0	*	Doesn't this seem like worth reporting?
t1_duyx3s1	1	*	Well for me I love guns because I grew up in the country and hunting was a hobby and a way of acquiring food.  So it easily became one of my favourite hobbies.  Edit: I am Canadian btw
t1_duynn94	0	*	So literally exactly the same as in the US. Let me guess they also love to lie about what the gun laws are and/or wildly exaggerate their claims?
t1_duyap8b	0	*	Those types of rifles aren't universally popular for all types of sport shooting though.
t1_duxsh9s	1	*	Wtf are you on about?
t1_duz06km	1	*	that's nice and all. but it's not relevant. The well regulated militia line is a justifying clause. 
t1_duxh27r	0	*	The point is **the entire process** started long **before** any of that stuff ever happened in America. 
t1_duxnlow	0	*	>Also, how many individual freedoms did we give up in reaction to 9/11?  Yeah and isn't it so much better now that the government spies on everyone, I agree we should give the government more power /s
t1_duyb9q8	0	*	Norway, the topic here is Norway.
t1_duxytmc	0	*	One of my favorite quotes
t1_duyicrn	0	*	I didn't think Germany was contender for leader on morality
t1_duyk61k	0	*	I've no doubt, but the question was what makes semi auto's more dangerous and the answer is that an unskilled shooter can let out a lot more rounds per minute.
t1_duxfx6p	0	*	Well than If you are a US citizen than good for you, I guess the US government will let you keep your sword and muzzle loaded, black powder musket just like the lawmakers back in 1791 intended. 
t1_duyi479	0	*	Most Europeans don't view their governments as sleeping evil nightmares that they might have to one day fight.  They also generally trust their military enough to do that job for them.
t1_duyc1yc	1	*	And how much longer do you think it would take to get this semi auto? How long do you think it takes someone with average shooting experience to get to the level where you compete internationally?
t1_duxwy63	0	*	When did we start talking about the US?
t1_duyi9vm	1	*	The army supressed rebelion in syria...
t1_duzixrx	1	*	And yet your government is fucking you and you do nothing.
t1_duyb3ge	0	*	Yeah. It's an extreme example used mostly to get a laugh though.  Mountains make up a large part of the country. Straight roads are rarely very long.
t1_duyisza	0	*	I don't necessarily disagree with you on private gun ownership. But you are as much an extremist as your strawmen of people in this thread are.   You're not really open to change your mind either.
t1_duypr2c	1	*	Eh, the great thing about the AR-15 is that it's modular and is easily modified to shoot higher, or lower caliber shells. My Dad has one chambered for hunting deer, and it's a great weapon to have.
t1_duyipyf	0	*	I'm from Europe. Police usually have to use guns maybe once or twice a year in the country I'm from. Altogether, not each. They're respected, friendly and helpful here.
t1_duycc26	0	*	If the military joins you, you can't lose. If the military doesn't, you can't win. An individual's  firearms are largely irrelevant in the case of a revolt or a coup. 
t1_duz0hl5	1	*	The Haitian Revolution is the only one that comes to mind. I agree with your view.
t1_dv2jpa3	0	*	Cool thanks.
t1_duyfsgb	1	*	[People are stupid.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPMMNvYTEyI)

t1_duyscbh	1	*	This. But i didnt feel like typing out all the causes.
t1_duxz707	0	*	Literally everything in your post is the exact opposite of the truth, well done.
t1_duynpcs	0	*	How pathetic a society has to be to just accept that their big brother government can tell them they aren't trustworthy and you have zero problems with it.
t1_duy636e	1	*	Yell 'Am I being detained?' loudly and repeatedly?
t1_duywkqv	1	*	Arms have other more practical uses as well such as home defence.
t1_duynyp0	0	*	But are we any less free than the gun-wielding American populace in those respects? 
t1_duyhj2i	0	*	No. Couple of kids were just a while ago though.
t1_duyh5al	0	*	You are completely correct, are you Swiss?  I've just gotten so used to people not from here misrepresenting or misunderstanding how things work here.
t1_duxsdgc	1	*	About what the fuck you're talking about?
t1_dv1ccri	0	*	Why? Our crime rates are declining at the same rate of australias.
t1_duyhv07	1	*	Not familiar enough with it I am afraid. 
t1_duy0ouc	0	*	Automatic weapons cost tens of thousands of dollars and require all kinds of additional work.
t1_duy8ikn	1	*	Oftentimes they are the ones fighting against the loss of the others. 
t1_duxq6pw	1	*	Sure, I can agree with that. 
t1_duylf9n	1	*	Wild hogs are pests, and exterminating them with firearms is highly effective. Hard to do with anything less than an AR-15.
t1_duywi4p	1	*	You actually have most of those rights except the retarded troll ones...
t1_duysufh	0	*	Because of a lot of people in this chat spreading their anti-freedom pro-state beliefs, it might be.
t1_duy7u9n	0	*	So... you wouldn't need the guns, then, anyway?
t1_duy640n	1	*	That Fenjamin's name? Einbert Alstein.
t1_duysfg1	1	*	Examples?
t1_duy1e2c	0	*	I mean, from my experience in the city; gun laws are super tight. You can't even transport your own weapons without jumping through hoops.
t1_duykuve	0	*	>Guns in the hands of citizens are the last line of defense.  Against whom? Germany's second uprising? Lol.
t1_duxhthc	0	*	You don't talk shit to Darth Cheney when he's carrying a gun and a daypack full of plausible deniability, that's what you don't do. 
t1_duyom8w	0	*	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_laws_in_Switzerland#Acquisition  If stuff like that was proposed in the US the NRA would be shouting TYRANNY! from the rooftops.
t1_duzfh2a	1	*	>You also getto play with 155mm air burst rounds tearing trees to pieces  We certainly should.
t1_duyg26k	0	*	So we have already reached the state of deliberate obtuseness and semantic arguments. Congratulations.

t1_duza1mz	1	*	> your fear of a slippery slope, which is a logical fallacy.  Is it? Look at privacy. I have doubted the validity of this fallacy as it is currently being interpreted for a while now.
t1_duy8hap	1	*	Yet semiauto firearms are by far the most useful. 
t1_duz518z	0	*	Way less stopping power and thus unlikely to kill the animal on the first shot.
t1_duybb6j	0	*	You don't see the irony in your comments?
t1_duyjmwb	1	*	I'm not saying an individual will do it. Cartels or gangs will invest in one to distribute illegally. 
t1_duz78lm	1	*	I know it was just a typo, but now I really want to see the statistics on ass shootings.
t1_dv0afqt	1	*	Much less than people in the US for sure, thanks to my freedom from guns!
t1_duxy6ek	1	*	And standard AR-15 magazines are 20 rounds.  Things change.
t1_du8s410	0	*	Thanks for the info!
t1_du7u2ck	1	*	Lol... 
t1_du8zq16	0	*	you rounded 88.7 to Over 90. That's a difference of over 4.1 million people.

t1_du9ja59	0	*	The free market is out of control here, those countries likely have better regulations than we do. Here we have seen the free market do nothing but pinch pennies at the cost of peoples' health.

t1_dsomcto	1	*	And that's a discussion for another day!
t1_dsoc2m8	1	*	Sahf lahnden mate
t1_dsoeqrw	0	*	Ya I don't care that much. If I did though oh man watch out
t1_dsoio3d	1	*	>as a hardcore non conformist, I try to avoid things so we'll liked by others.  Wow aren't you fun to be around?
t1_dsnx4ek	0	*	Fair enough, I would just think that people that support him for trolling would actually share his views on policy aswell.
t1_dsq2iq5	0	*	Theres also bits that are sufficiently pseudo-Celtic, enough so that they might have started off as early historical fanfiction about real microkingdoms in the UK.
t1_dsnviao	0	*	The plan got changed to a fence and a ditch
t1_dso0hqz	1	*	80 points above average? Those are rookie numbers!
t1_dsnvr9g	0	*	there was one i posted some time back where the guy fought the police so much that they finally gave up and let him go.   [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=51Xw3RXPLsY)
t1_dsomr75	1	*	Scott Adams used to be awesome.  But as Trump's star rose, Adams' mind melted like ice cream on a hot summer day.
t1_dso0to3	1	*	Ah yes he did mention Brietbart, had forgotten, though not in a positive way. Though some of the online talk shows he watchs and subscribes to would fit square in that box I guess. 
t1_dsnws28	0	*	Why do you hate the Germans?
t1_dso2jnb	1	*	Engining, then. Happy??
t1_dso644w	1	*	EDIT: Replied to wrong comment
t1_dso0r5z	0	*	Why did you have to be so Condescending? 
t1_dsohep9	0	*	They are highly correlated. Look it up. 
t1_dsok448	1	*	Uh huh, sure, whatever you say. 
t1_dsnxoxp	0	*	Classic. Pointing out that somebody else did something similar to what Trump is currently being criticized for as if that somehow matters at all. Never gets old. 
t1_dsnwz43	1	*	I've lived in a lot of different cities, both large and very small. All of them have had shelters. 
t1_dsnwj1h	1	*	Those two things could not be less similar 
t1_dso3a21	1	*	The money shot... https://youtu.be/Ebt0l8s3aMQ?t=3m10s
t1_dsoiurj	1	*	Yeah Trump supporters are the worst glad you agree.
t1_dspczx8	1	*	You daun't?
t1_dsnyyfg	1	*	Ya i'm sure that's right
t1_dsnxp35	0	*	Yeah it sounds like people like it a lot! I mean, you don't usually go 54 series on a bad or not-well executed premise.
t1_dspdzjg	1	*	 Meh, i was just expanding on the whole freedom for me, tyranny for others thing everyone does from the perspective of someone who thinks guns will protect them. 
t1_dsnycyh	0	*	[Why are you assuming they're illiterates?](http://www.latimes.com/world/africa/la-fg-global-african-immigrants-explainer-20180112-story.html) Oh yeah, cause you're a racist just like Trump.  
t1_dsqd4pr	1	*	Hackneyed comment is a flag you have nothing to actually say.
t1_dsnxn3d	0	*	I've seen clips of WILTY on YouTube but have never came across HIGNFY, hence my ignorance.  I'm also an American btw, just in case there was any doubt still.
t1_dso3hzp	1	*	I'm old enough to remember it vividly! It was awesome to see that on the CBC! 
t1_dsooari	0	*	Actions speak louder than words. I concur. 
t1_dso1x3d	1	*	The Scottish person I know best is my mate's Mum... Yeah it fits.
t1_dso9q29	1	*	aayyyyy ;) ;) ;)  (I approve)
t1_dsnzuuz	1	*	Thanks for this. Sound writing.
t1_dso6ixl	0	*	You don't vote for kings!
t1_dsnzevv	1	*	Churchill lost the empire even though India, the first part of the Empire to be given their independence was given it 2 years after he left office?
t1_dso2fi3	0	*	In Germany they are mega strict about torrenting
t1_dsnwxd8	1	*	No need for that.  Confirmation bias is a helluva drug.
t1_dso4n8c	0	*	You do realize people immigrate right?
t1_dsnzki6	0	*	So he doesn't have to follow government law, but the second someone does something he doesn't like, he calls the cops? Isn't that 100% hypocrisy? 
t1_dso2e6e	0	*	Socialism doesnt work, it has never worked, and it never will work.
t1_dsomeyl	0	*	Your reading comprehension skills are dismal.   I answered your question in my first sentence. If you're not from the US then why exactly do you give a shit? 
t1_dso7euj	0	*	Watch your tone with me, boy. You may be the waiter, but I am still your superior as a chef.
t1_dsnxrvc	0	*	Oh Bell Bottom Blues!
t1_dso5nj2	0	*	Isnt that fraud? It sounds like it would be illegal to sign any name other than your own on a contract but Im not a lawyer. 
t1_dso08pc	0	*	And on top of that you have to actually know magic (i.e. the law). The spells theyre trying to cast are almost always ones that dont work anyway.
t1_dsnz3eb	1	*	But if I was to attack them with a 2x4 they'd be SCREAMING for the police to protect them.  
t1_dsnxqg1	1	*	Who the Americans and Trump supporters in general? That would be a good idea.
t1_dsnyqx3	0	*	Let me guess, you also credit Trump with the stock market and ISIS being defeated?
t1_dsnv9lw	0	*	Weak straw man argument.   I didn't say anything about how you feel but your comment seems to insinuate that you know how your whole country feels. 
t1_dsnyq6v	0	*	Yeah? Nothing there contradicts anything I've said so far. 
t1_dsnzryp	1	*	I feel like this happened a lot.....
t1_dso6ka3	1	*	I would not be surprised at the mental illness part. 
t1_dsnvr63	0	*	Just type sovereign citizen into YouTube.   Say goodbye to the next two hours of your life
t1_dsphs0c	0	*	But you do get to do that with that game. Here's a logical paradox, courtesy of Crusader Kings II: if you father a child with your aunt, who's that child? Is it your cousin? Or is it your daughter? 
t1_dsnylc3	0	*	It's a shit law that should be repealed. 
t1_dsnyu1q	1	*	As opposed to sitting down, like on a sitcom.
t1_dsnwhvy	1	*	Do something to prevent Assad's atrocities in the first place and maybe just maybe you can have 5 minutes at the mic
t1_dsoku9f	1	*	The Orzhov guild will have a word with you shortly.
t1_dsosx8p	1	*	I know the song, the choice of doo dee doos simply didnt translate to that for me.

t1_dso1p4v	1	*	I GOT A JAR OF DIRT
t1_dso4js7	1	*	Just enjoy the show and ignore em. 
t1_dso3ew0	1	*	Maybe being around good people like yourself helped!
t1_dso7rrw	1	*	No doubt, but let's not assume their supporters are one monolithic entity either.   It's so easy to hit them with their own views than ascribing them somebody elses
t1_dsobbe5	1	*	Nothing is impossible, but it doesn't seem remotely likely to me. 
t1_dsnxdk2	0	*	While we're at it, could I get a Zelda please?
t1_dsnyupt	0	*	Because it's what the people doing this think he is. Why else would they bring gallows? 
t1_dsnwaq1	0	*	and how do you do that without being an absolute twat to hundreds of thousands of people, we are talking 4-6 people out of potential millions
t1_dsognry	1	*	It's better they don't procreate.

t1_dso11od	0	*	And nowhere did I dispute that, I'm just stating that we adhere to laws that no longer make a ton of sense. 
t1_dsnyplp	0	*	What I dont get is why you keep copy/pasting this exact comment throughout this thread. 
t1_dsoi7gb	1	*	Ok Ill file it with Ginnel, Midden and Mardy. 
t1_dso6yks	0	*	You're a sheep, and you don't even realize it.   You think it's the other way around, but it's not. 
t1_dso31lm	1	*	Aww, you're cute. Fuck little Barron too. 
t1_dsnyh5m	1	*	Oh look, such a well-worded argument. I'm totally going to change my mind about Trump and his supporters because of your eloquence. 
t1_dsnw9x2	0	*	Have you been there? And where are you from?

t1_dsnwgzk	0	*	What if they were born in the country? Not a lot you can do there..
t1_dso63i9	0	*	Lets be real here; theres no way they know or understand the existence of white Muslims. Literally none. 0%. 
t1_dso245x	1	*	They believe a person is a legal construct of sorts that binds it's associated human to laws. Or something like that.
t1_dso15bz	0	*	You Either Die A Dilbert, Or You Live Long Enough To See Yourself Become The Pointy-Haired Boss.

t1_dtjiboj	0	*	You just highlighted the key flaw of democracy 
t1_dt4oggs	0	*	You couldn't do better than a played out Art of War quote?   Sun Tzu would scold you for being predictable.
t1_dv4a4q9	0	*	Where has this charity been now that the election is over?
t1_dsbkhiq	1	*	I mean obviously not, people die from medical negligence all the time regardless of funding. 
t1_dsbeo7g	0	*	Don't bash the torie's on this one, financial crisis and now brexit are putting a strain on the nations coffers. Also i'm fairly sure that Hammond announced a large increase in NHS funding this year. 
t1_dsbex98	0	*	Can you back up this being normal?   It wouldn't be big news if it was. Like others said this is a rare occurrence that has made the news.
t1_dsbdpoi	1	*	You didnt, nor did I. I was taking about murder, in which police occasionally partake
t1_dub1geb	0	*	I think because they dont want mass immigration at all
t1_dsjbpo7	1	*	He said it as if it was something he disliked though. I'm not interested in it either, I can find it cute.
t1_dsuoxvs	0	*	Rationally argue against more rights for people (that do not violate other people's rights, so obviously no free stealing or violence). Please, I dare you.
t1_dsj7mpb	1	*	Oh Josh is supergay
t1_dv6gr02	0	*	24 hours at most with modern monitoring technology.
t1_dv5mu9j	0	*	Imagine if the whole world could just be like Norway.  It would make things so much easier.
t1_dv6437c	1	*	Not him, but I do and I've pretty much avoided buying diesels. Once electric cars (that aren't terrible) become available in my country I plan to ditch fossil fuel vehicles as much as possible.
t1_dv66v71	1	*	Sure.  I wasn't saying I'm not also complicit.  It is hard not to be, the way the system has been constructed.
t1_dv5t3ga	0	*	we haven't even built pipeline to coastlines yet. that's like diversifying way before we even take advantage of it. like eating veggies but no meat.
t1_dteh08r	0	*	If you notice, you didnt actually address any of his points. This kind of lazy arguing will get you trump 2020. 
t1_dtex9n5	0	*	I felt it was too trivial to mention since it currently only excludes 3 people.
t1_dterbv2	0	*	I'm not familiar with them but insulting Lady Diana is not as horrible as literally going after elderly people for being obstinate. 
t1_dtg3dwj	1	*	You are rightt, he did campaign on ending DACA.  
t1_dteou26	0	*	*It's got electrolytes!!!*   I don't live in the US but this is how I imagine it from the anecdotes.
t1_dterl4h	0	*	Sorry if this comes off as an insult, but does being such a piece of shit ever get to you? That sounds pretty grimy.
t1_dtfh9vu	0	*	Does it not piss you off? When I see someone doing the same in an Irish accent, I just assume they're a twat, or they're not actually Irish.  The fecking eejits!
t1_dtejufn	1	*	Still in school at 23  What a ducking nerd am i rite guys?  
t1_dtfv9d6	1	*	I am a troll but wasn't with that comment, lol
t1_dtex4br	1	*	Indeed. Or the Independence vote here in Scotland.    I seem to always chose the losing horse :(
t1_dtfrqzr	1	*	Our docs cut those out.
t1_dtf1jqf	0	*	Answer the question Steven.
t1_dteh7uz	0	*	Alright, murderer, killer, pick your term, doesn't change the facts. 
t1_dtf66tx	0	*	Cut taxes, pulled out of TPP, pulled out of climate accord, attempt to renegotiate NAFTA, cut regulations, more drilling, working on immigration reform, America first agenda, bringing jobs back. K
t1_dtex898	1	*	> buzzwords and slogans  That's 21st century politics for you.    Plus it's a lot easier to drag up some muck on your opponent than actually offer up a well thought out plan of your own.
t1_dtemnp4	1	*	Not in Donny land. He never pays up!
t1_dtfeqcn	0	*	Well, if you dont understand the reference then let it be, and take the description of it. Or you could challenge the meat of what I commented and not the red herring.
t1_dtgj7wp	1	*	That is a lie.
t1_dtfb90b	1	*	so we exclude 4 more people
t1_dtez9gk	0	*	Brits are probably second by a clear margin tbf
t1_dtf5ls2	1	*	That'd just make the VP acting president immediately.
t1_dtex7kr	1	*	Theodore Roosevelt was the youngest at 42 but Bill Clinton was 46 and he's still around. 
t1_dtgclak	0	*	>Please stay very far away from politics until you're educated.  well that's a pretty good example. insulting intelligence is one of the oldest ones in the book man.
t1_dteqx2p	1	*	While true... making huge generalisations when youve only lived in a small part of the U.K. and being American.. is really not a good look.
t1_dter3y0	1	*	That makes it worse, thats like a Frenchman coming living in Alabama for a while then saying all of America is like this its just bullshit 
t1_dtf62ge	0	*	He is, he really is. And whoever you wanted isnt U0001f602
t1_dtf9zhh	1	*	That explains the slovenly appearance, but not the bigotry.
t1_dteh7ou	0	*	Just say you lost
t1_dsh3mph	0	*	> What is the first thing that you think of when Israel comes up?  Dr. Saadiah Falafel on King George Street in Tel Aviv.
t1_dtrpa9w	0	*	You claimed the talks failed because palestinians demanding prisoner releases. Your link clearly shows Israel was happy to release the prisoners, but talks still fell through.
t1_dtq2or0	0	*	Like the palestinian kids playing football on the beach? 
t1_dtpz0v4	0	*	>they didn't kill anyone.   then   >Yes they will kill   Thanks for playing.
t1_dtr94fh	1	*	>  the Palestinians had no formal legal land ownership structures  Sure they did:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ottoman_Land_Code_of_1858#The_Ottoman_Land_Code_(as_applied_in_the_Palestine_Mandate)
t1_dtra7on	0	*	It's Israeli land. Palestine has never been a sovereign entity. Keep covering for terrorists. 
t1_dtru7a2	1	*	Yeah usually people surrender when they lose wars instead of whining for 60 years acting like theyre owed sovereignty. Which Palestine has never had for millennia by the way. 
t1_dtclu6s	1	*	Ahh. Sorry man, i misunderstood. I cant help you find humility and self-reflection youll have to look elsewhere.
t1_du4t8yc	1	*	East German economy was already wrecked prior to unification 
t1_du4jow3	0	*	The current Chinese regime is a world power and they call themselves communists.  They aren't really, but by your statement, I feel like you were using it in a partisan way.
t1_du5amqd	1	*	Well I guess its how you define peaceful. Peaceful as in a peaceful protest, maybe not. Peaceful as in removing a dictator, Id say so. 
t1_du59yza	1	*	No one cares about some people.  Its sad. 
t1_dufugee	0	*	Our business owners made bank for years. Theyll jump at the chance again.
t1_du4c1mb	0	*	>No, I don't think they have problems with that.   Going by the official Chinese reaction to japan reinterpreting their constitution I think otherwise
t1_du4g93d	0	*	>From the outside it looks like you have socialism for the rich  You shouldn't get all your views from people who don't know anything. 
t1_du5cc4d	1	*	Ah yes, can't do the right thing if it costs too much money. Silly us.
t1_du4xdgg	1	*	duly noted
t1_du4nz85	0	*	Oh look, u/lockwood40 believes a radar just magically stopped working once the radio wave reaches beyond the borders of SK. Have you finished high school yet?
t1_du50u0e	0	*	Not saying it does. 
t1_du4it5n	0	*	No, no, no. Communism has worked in literally every situation its been installed. It was sanctions that ruined it. /s.
t1_du4irvz	1	*	Uhh, maybe look at the soviets transports. We gave them so much shit. Without us I bet Russia would have at the very most made a peace treaty with Germany. 
t1_du4vye5	0	*	The post is vague and references historically disjoint events. So lacking in substance that it should be summarily ignored.
t1_dud8xoa	1	*	Typical gyopo. Knows fuck all about their own country.
t1_du4kwi6	1	*	Omg, these comments are getting ridiculous. CommunistKorea could be a super power. Yea, they look real good with their defectors and parasites.
t1_du4ooav	1	*	It is a hell of a lot easier sitting out a winter in a city instead of an open field. And Germany would only need to capture west and most populous part of Russia. 
t1_du4rh7r	0	*	Going by Chinese reaction with THAAD, I think they will go absolutely apeshit with economic sanctions if SK went to develop independent nuclear weapons.
t1_du4x9j0	0	*	What abuses? Please, pleeeeeeeease tell me. What kind of abuses have these people committed against our shores & cities?
t1_du58c94	0	*	Maybe you should ask the South Koreans who have a much better understanding and a much larger stake in all this instead of assuming your opinion is correct?
t1_du4npnt	1	*	Marxist-Leninist states of the 20th century tended to be unsuccessful. Marxist philosophy works in moderation, like most other things, not if it is the only driving force behind a nation.
t1_du551jn	0	*	Weird good thing we haven't heard news about bot armies trying to sway public opinion or anything recently. Otherwise id be suspicious about all these North Korea experts.
t1_du4l0k4	1	*	Possibly but I would assume that would be considered and accounted for in the agreement. Maybe with quotas or limits. But that's all speculation on my part. 
t1_du5918v	0	*	America is not the world police.
t1_du615v0	1	*	Koreans and Japanese hate each other. So it's not surprising Japan wants war in the two Koreas.
t1_du5a1cs	1	*	You just gotta get some bone spurs and you too can spout this MANLY rhetoric while simultaneously avoiding all consequences of being a retarded meatball.
t1_du4t57i	1	*	Well he said no to stepping down until after 92. Sounds like he was doing alright.  
t1_du67a1i	1	*	And I should have worded my reply clearer, sorry.
t1_ds3qbc4	0	*	He didn't provide an actual apology. He was sorry he is facing criticism for his mistake, but is not sorry about the actual mistake.
t1_dsxe3fa	0	*	How old is he? They live for such a long time, that you'll probably have him into your retirement years. I can only imagine what's to come re. his learning.   Do you ever let him fly?
t1_dsxkwdl	1	*	That's nice and all, but doesn't answer my question. 
t1_dsxd70f	1	*	They call it... fishing
t1_dsxz07g	1	*	Perfect
t1_dsxb5j8	0	*	So is the econony and love and pokemon. Just because something is a human concept doesn't make it not real or that it doesn't have meaningful ramifications.
t1_dsy7l1t	1	*	You must be referring to the monkey and frog incident. 
t1_dsxcpdt	1	*	Are you a relative of that chimp?!
t1_dsx4poj	0	*	Real talk - how did you manage to read well enough going into it that this was the first book you had ever read?
t1_dsx6nbo	1	*	So, THAT'S how the South will rise again!
t1_dsx67k3	0	*	Sure but if suddenly everyone is foraging and hunting for everything vaguely edible there may not be a lot left.
t1_dsxmt8a	1	*	I'm southern and I sincerely doubt 5% of the people I know have those skills. People in the rural south? Sure. But most of us live in cities and would be just as fucked if grocery stores disappeared.
t1_dsxitvw	1	*	Im not being anything since Im not the one youre having a discussion with.
t1_dsxsnhk	0	*	Maybe so, but death threats are never a fun thing, it can even create problems working in a clinical setting where you're just looking for potential issues 
t1_dsx4b5r	0	*	That statement is completelty asinine and is probably predicated on the whole: but lions eat meat, it's natural.       That's one fallacy down.
t1_dsy19ar	1	*	Nothing, but forcing your preference on someone who can't make a different choice later is wrong.
t1_dsxopj6	1	*	Eh, not really I guess.
t1_dsx5qrc	0	*	Not just the south. In Michigan here, have friends who hunt and process it themselves. Plus we've got a ton of farms around here, too. 
t1_dsxf94q	1	*	Cool bird mayne.
t1_dsxbhi7	1	*	Is there a waterproof edition? Asking for a friend.   Also i feel like there is at least one or two really lazy whales who are not happy about the aquarium's decision.
t1_dsya2jm	0	*	Uh huh.  And billions of humans can only work on one single issue at a time.  I get it.
t1_dsx42kl	0	*	That was awful but Im sure youre a wonderful person and so Im upvoting you anyway. Happy Friday and dont let it happen again. 
t1_dsxjisp	1	*	I was there a few years ago. Top-notch institution, but I felt really bad for the bigger animals because the tanks seemed very very small. 
t1_dsx8g2o	1	*	They do but the thing is the wildlife populations would dissapear very quickly if they became one of the primary sources of food
t1_dsx5bq7	1	*	I'm sure you enjoy Wednesdays. 
t1_dsxmviq	1	*	4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42
t1_dsxarv5	0	*	Could you please point out where The Dodo manages to put bias into that article? 
t1_dsxsgk8	1	*	Maybe so, but people are crazy about this shit, it makes getting work done a lot more complicated because just going into  a normal clinical setting to study an issue can create problems 
t1_dsx498g	0	*	Read my comment again. Where in grandpa's fucking socks do I compare animals to humans? All that I said is *literally* factual. People just don't like hearing it.
t1_dsxs1by	0	*	You're right, for whatever reason I was a little too agitated this afternoon. My apologies for the remark.
t1_dsy9x8n	0	*	I'm trying to show you how much of an oversimplification that is. 
t1_dsx5c6i	1	*	Good idea
t1_dsxtzyw	1	*	The only reason people don't kill each other now is because there is an abundance of resources. Civilization is twenty-four hours and two meals away from barbarism.
t1_dsx4xls	1	*	Yeah perhaps they wouldn't be able to hunt properly and feed themselves 
t1_dsx9oqh	1	*	You know there's a lot of hunters in the north. A lot of northern states are way more rural and remote than the majority of the south. 
t1_dsxk9e8	1	*	I get the idea you think you're being clever but it's really hard to figure out what your point is. Assuming you have one.
t1_dtr1b2h	0	*	I mean. Technically Canada is south of me. 
t1_dsu9pd1	0	*	Another russian troll spitting out shit with no evidence. The main reason this is a serious issue is because russia operated a state  sponsored doping program and not just a few athletes.
t1_ds9s1ck	0	*	No. You might be in the group, but that doesn't mean we like you... Like /u/jaythewise U0001f914 
t1_dsef67l	0	*	I was saying my post was sarcastic. 
t1_dsesw0w	1	*	Personally i wouldnt care if my phone were a little thicker, but.to each his own.
t1_dseptes	1	*	Or just buy offbrand batteries much cheaper and keep their phone alive.
t1_dsfsxv3	0	*	What do you think planned obsolescence is? I think we might have a different meaning.
t1_duxu8qs	0	*	Probably.
t1_duxi3pl	1	*	If only i grew up in a rich family and daddy could get me in any school I wanted to by giving them donations. 
t1_duxkwm8	0	*	And written Portuguese from Portugal is pretty different than that from Brazil. It's markedly different than English in the US and England, for instance. 
t1_duxi1f7	0	*	/u/PhantomKnight1776 spends his time on /r/The_Donald 
t1_du6vcr3	0	*	You know who was there before you? Greeks.   Let's fix that historical mistake.
t1_dv3qiwi	0	*	We still have Scottish whisky and plenty of good wine and beer over here. Well survive a short-term lack of bourbon.
t1_dv449g5	0	*	The tide commercials were terrible. Stop this Millennial joke.
t1_dv3i3va	1	*	> Them? Bernie is one person.  What a fake concern answer. Them refers to his policies. 
t1_dv3f7uk	0	*	I guess it is a win for Canadian Whiskey exports.
t1_dv5nndi	1	*	We have a few decent whiskies. But yeah, those spirits are not our specialty. Still, saying Germany doesn't have good spirits based on that is very narrowminded.
t1_dv3xck6	0	*	But Mueller can overcome all of that. They know hes nuts. Republicans will self preserve in the end. 
t1_dv41yea	0	*	No, something stupid. Not the acts of a stable genius. 
t1_dv46uf1	1	*	It's not. You are massively profiting from being Europes trading port. Without it, large parts of your economy wouldn't even exist. Rotterdam, as a harbour, would be irrelevant.
t1_dv3llml	0	*	But what does mom think about this 
t1_dv49lcv	0	*	I dunno, man. Seems better than most of the US.
t1_dv5x0vh	0	*	I didn't  know getting your dog to jokingly do a Nazi salute was a death threat.
t1_dv3y9g5	0	*	Bah, give me a good old half bottle of Ilech Islay and burn that american stuff. I kid, I kid. But in all seriousness, Tenesee whiskey is a form of bourbon so Jack Daniels still count as bourbon.
t1_dv4481f	1	*	More than anything trump has taken over in what has been a time of low unemployment and a strong economy. People dont care that much when shits going okay. 
t1_dv45wxr	1	*	Never said vast majority...
t1_dv47a8v	1	*	Well funding an army of twitter bots involves deception and impersonation which I think is the difference between the two. There's nothing deceptive about trade tariffs. 
t1_dv4m632	1	*	Actually that is what i meant...you are correct.....the pledge. 
t1_dv43smi	1	*	We still have Ireland in the Union?
t1_dv48rgu	1	*	Like the documentary The Handmaids Tale

t1_dv4cfi0	1	*	No he wasnt. He started a war against the sea
t1_dv4dcdo	1	*	This was planned a while ago. The EU just executes a plan they had in the drawer for some time.
t1_dv6twa0	1	*	That was the joke....

t1_duu2wbn	0	*	Your maple prez is way more of a rich kid than our awesome prez, but we can be buddies, friend
t1_dutrcg1	0	*	I'm pretty sure the US and allies have considered every aspect of this during the past 60+ years in order to decide not to do it.
t1_duu3tha	0	*	I'm not a big fan of it, but using it against alt-rights and trumpists makes them so fucking angry cause to them it's one of the worst insults. It's like smacking someone with their own hand
t1_duulgoq	1	*	mmmhmmm very substantive arguments haha
t1_dv53fba	0	*	>  reckless cyclists  lol... Bitch please!  Numbers of deaths or severe injuries caused directly by bicycles last year. Gimme gimme the stats!

t1_dv4pje3	0	*	With batteries, we can go longer and faster.
t1_dv53k97	0	*	I could reel off a list of highway code infractions I see from car drivers on a daily basis.   The average person is a selfish idiot whether they're on a bike or in a car.

t1_dum57wq	0	*	I get your point, but the PRCs claim to Tibet comes from the ROC assertion that it is part of China. Just like Formosa.   
t1_dum1vuf	0	*	> It's neighbor...  Yes. Both the PRC and ROC claim to be china. But you already knew that right?  
t1_dumqtkz	1	*	Okay...Show me the prove of someone in China ordered the killing of Chinese in the number of more than that of Hitler's.
t1_dum7zun	0	*	>I don't care if the government commits mass murder  That's your word, not mine. Nice try. Name one mass murder happened in China in the last 10 years
t1_du58su9	1	*	They have different ideologies so no its not the same. That's like equating different branches of the same religion as being interchangeably labeled. 
t1_du51xv9	1	*	No, how hard a drug is refers to how damaging the effects of taking the drug are. 
t1_du5fpug	0	*	That's because for you there's a clear cut between thinking is doing, but there isn't.  Anyway, you're making this personal to avoid putting systemic issues into question, a shift of attention.
t1_du58uxa	1	*	If they could be worse than stalinists you better use the correct term and call them maoists so we don't confuse them for something tamer. 
t1_du5cix1	0	*	it's the eyes, isn't it?  
t1_du5sjrf	1	*	He didn't come up with the plans himself, but the way he ran his government, he had to personally approve every single government decision. 
t1_du50s8x	0	*	Hitler was a warmonger and a genocidal asshole. Duterte is just a genocidal asshole. No one's going to lift a finger unless he starts invading his neighbors.
t1_du15dbn	1	*	Except he did none of those things. 
t1_du1te87	1	*	It's not fair because *the candidate with the most votes* lost.

t1_dt87gli	1	*	No, he has explained very succinctly and correctly why this was a mis-use of the idiom. I think his time in the pub has served him well! 
t1_dtd6f55	0	*	Yeah dude, one of the best parts is that you can't walk more than a block in Bogota without finding a place to drink some coffee and eat a quick bite. It's fantastic
t1_duqigtp	0	*	Oh you're starting another revolution are you? Cute
t1_dup591q	0	*	What if they get stolen? How could one just keep a tank in their backyard. 
t1_dur97d9	0	*	Becuase the military works for the goverment and has to follow orders. If the Commander in Cheif says pull out the generals keep their mouth shut and pull out 
t1_duotvl2	1	*	You said it a lot better than I could. 
t1_dup1yoy	1	*	No country would think if invading US, it's just impossible even when there is no army. 
t1_dv1fzbo	1	*	Jeez. Buckle up folks
t1_dsuyofj	0	*	How about they get a real job?

t1_ds4m93y	0	*	You asked a question, I gave a factual reply that apparently ruffled your feathers enough for you to attempt to put words into my mouth to slander me with.
t1_ds2n40u	0	*	Back up your claims with evidence. Just claiming isn't evidence.  YOU LOST THIS SERIOUS DISCUSSION, BYE! *posts dated meme*
t1_ds2hvl4	0	*	Thats why it was so tragic that they colluded.  Totally pointless, and created huge strife in the party plus alienated voters
t1_ds30s9l	1	*	LMAO! Good one. Mean but funny.
t1_ds2ke29	0	*	I looked at the links you gave, they were all about Operation broken heart, a Police operation from 2014 to arrest child sex offenders. no mention of Hillary Clinton anywhere.
t1_ds37j5d	1	*	But all the breast ones were taken.
t1_ds4ix9h	1	*	Now, now.  Don't go telling us your entire life story.  Leave some for the intrigue (and the hotline operator).
t1_ds2qeb1	0	*	You are right, i am sorry for insulting Neanderthals in such a way, you are more like stegosaurus level intelligence.
t1_dty18rx	0	*	I don't agree with his view but they way you are approaching this 'discussion' is lazy and adversarial. Either don't respond or try and add value.
t1_dtzj6v0	0	*	Oh right, they've reduced the number because they made them more powerful... Hypocrites.  Americans and their defenders are hypocrites who happily lie to themselves.
t1_dsqpr10	0	*	Sure they were a sham but, the precedent of  just following orders was invalidated and, remains to this day.  This was the right call. The precedent remains to this day.
t1_dsa7s3w	1	*	I think it depends on where you came from as well as other things like education and other options. 
t1_duv4j4o	0	*	Have you checked  factcheckarmenia.com/home/en  ?  
t1_duiaroc	0	*	It has everything to do with it.   I can only assume that Australia's embarrassing loss in the great emu war is what caused her populace to reject their guns. Sour grapes. 
t1_duipu5z	0	*	Right! So it's disengenuous to assume the protests are just against violence.    They're against gun violence.   Caused by guns.   Which are only made to do one thing.   Cause violence.
t1_dtj61lc	0	*	Yea I know you are mostly right... I am expanding the possibilities of a concept of life that is so unlike ours that we currently can't comprehend it. 
t1_dtlboic	0	*	*Three* guys, big boy, *three* guys (us + you.)  If you is interested, give me a call at 908-208-1171. Call any times even if you is just feeling lonely and want somebuddy to talk to ;)
t1_dtkj3uz	1	*	Haha never said I was an expert, and no idea what the fuck your doorbell has to do with anything.  You sure sound angry though. Maybe you need a kitten?
t1_duxkpba	1	*	Im with you there.
t1_dsma3e8	1	*	What a well informed, thought provoking comment. Are you a journalist?
t1_dsm342q	0	*	Maybe you should check out Gonzales v. Raich...
t1_dsltvzu	1	*	But they disagree with the very law that was just changed because the law was stupid. 
t1_dslt02y	1	*	So, youre saying that they just didnt think it through?  Like I said before, they either didnt think it through or theyre sycophants(aka human garbage).
t1_dspp1uj	1	*	You never mentioned a deal.
t1_dsprpsj	1	*	So it should be legal, but people should be punished for using it.  Okay.
t1_dsnk6kq	0	*	https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/federal-prison-conditions-improve-under-liberal-rule-new-data-says/article34335089/  I think you just hate liberals.
t1_dslkrij	0	*	Sure, but it also makes you wonder why.  Something tells me it has more to do with money and less to do with putting bad people behind bars.
t1_dslzmjj	1	*	Comparing smoking weed to slavery. Stay classy reddit
t1_dte6b70	1	*	They don't care about facts. They just want to shit on Ireland because they feel slighted. 
t1_dtejv1t	1	*	Same way they went to war with the biggest empire on the planet, brought them to their knees and won, probably
t1_dtel96l	0	*	Well both islands are insignificant so its safe to assume no 007 type agents are sent there. Irish politicians are safe. What a huge relief. 
t1_dtdog21	0	*	So you are okay with them getting stabbed to death while they sleep?
t1_dtdrp0s	0	*	Tibetans arent denied citizenship. They just want local autonomy which is a separate issue. 
t1_dtdjuqs	1	*	If you know nothing of the Troubles and the history of NI which you obviously dont, then refrain from posting about them.
t1_dtel5pw	1	*	In support of a Yemeni government. That frankly has as much legitimacy as the next contender for a Yemeni government. If that matters 
t1_dtect7m	1	*	Crimea is a Jewish state?
t1_dtdem2w	0	*	Palestine was first mentioned in the 5th century BC. Or is that what you call modern? 
t1_dtf2e45	0	*	Totally irrelevant. Its not about whether everyone is happy, its whether millions of people are being rendered stateless. 
t1_dtedei1	1	*	No one asked Israel to give up Israel.....just to get their disgusting settlements out of the west bank. Which is not Israel.
t1_dtdwl9w	0	*	Listen I fully support hating Jews but if you want to actually punish crimes its all on you! 
t1_dte8xi8	0	*	Lol 50k is nothing your people are weak which is why you slaves for so long. Fuck Ireland. 
t1_dtee8q7	1	*	Recently I've seen peppers, avocadoes and persimmons/Sharon fruits for sale originating in Israel
t1_dt39ou3	0	*	Our founding fathers didn't stay and fix their own country, they left for something they felt would be better.
t1_dt3fozu	0	*	100% man. Epitome of 'fuck you, got mine' in this country. 
t1_dt3dmsn	1	*	> Execute them!  IS that the name of their new album ?   
t1_dt3hdw9	0	*	I doubt someone refusing to fight in a war would join the army.
t1_dt3cnw0	1	*	Your opinion is wrong. Go away.
t1_dt3togt	0	*	Umm they go to Australia instead of any of the countries in between like Indonesia because they know they will get rejected.
t1_dt3cgl8	1	*	Dude /s means the above was sarcasm
t1_dt3cna8	0	*	Its not just unavailable, the information is actively suppressed so even trying to report on boat turn backs or human rights abuses is a criminal offence.
t1_dt3b0fl	0	*	had the arabs won the 1948 war, do you think the jews who had lived there would be afforded the right of return and citizenship?
t1_dt3fpwg	0	*	We'll just tow it outside the environment

t1_dt36lj6	0	*	> you don't just throw them in Mexico  why not?
t1_dt3gj6m	0	*	Not true, Israel could set their own borders. 
t1_dt3ccny	0	*	And most of the land seized by zionists was Palestinian owned and occupied.
t1_dt3538r	0	*	What the fuck are you even talking about?
t1_dt384m2	0	*	Not only is it bad, it is the slogan of horrible beer. Kill it with fire. 
t1_dt3a99j	0	*	Check the qoutes again, those are ethnical cleansings of unarmed villagers, women and children shot in the back, burried in unmarked graves.
t1_dt3bv4c	0	*	I didn't say you didn't read it.  I'm simply saying reading the article you posted is important because your one line summary can't substitute given the complexity of the situation.
t1_dt3bgnf	1	*	Yes, it's only being established, but a place where children were soldiers so few years ago is a place some would not want to return to. Maybe not a shit hole, but it is still a developing nation.
t1_dt3dpth	1	*	o-oh ok then
t1_dt3bg4p	1	*	There's obviously a difference between refusing to kill Jewish civilians (which wasn't punished by death) and trying to assassinate Hitler.
t1_dt3d3z0	1	*	Rwanda is generally a very safe country. I visited once and I honestly felt it was so much safer than many shady parts of many first world countries.  
t1_dt3k2np	0	*	Im not quite understanding what you mean, can you elaborate?
t1_dt3oqwg	1	*	That's not a question.
t1_dt3bvpd	0	*	Not import, but people should have to right to migrate and work wherever they want, it's a human right.
t1_dt3i9to	0	*	Because it's not against specific nationalities, religions. It's against people who commit specific acts that would show a tendancy to not obey immigration regulations.
t1_dt3e9zt	1	*	You set the bar real low.   Baltimore is a shithole. 
t1_dt3mczp	1	*	That made no sense. Can you rephrase?
t1_dt384l6	1	*	Yeah, which is true. When possible to remedy that, we should.  We shouldn't refuse to help this person because in some other hypothetical we wouldn't be able to. 
t1_dt3woin	1	*	Air Force actually.  :).  Must have been all the Air Conditioned living conditions, rotted my brains.  Lol..  
t1_dt3qi4y	0	*	Seeing as they break the law entering the country in going to say 100% of them break the law 
t1_dt3hs86	1	*	I'm not sure you understand reality here -- that's what people do. They flee, and then they keep fleeing, because the intermediate nations haven't signed the relevant international agreements.
t1_dt9m98n	1	*	I don't know anything about Africa. But I do know a lot about the USA so I am an authority on it's shitholeness.
t1_dt3lueq	1	*	Hmm, interesting idea, but no I disagree. Thanks for the thinking exercise!
t1_dt3d5s8	0	*	fucking illegal dolphins, ruining our economy

t1_dt57c20	0	*	Neither. They're from safe countries.
t1_dt3qfm0	0	*	pretty sure Letter of Reprimand is an Air Force thing.  Article 15 is universal across all branch of services.  Marines have page 11s then straight to NJP.  
t1_dt3bqko	1	*	Off with their heads!
t1_dt3h9ya	1	*	The oceans did build a great reef as barrier, but doesn't look like they'll get to keep it.
t1_dt5pm3o	0	*	Yes, that's what I said multiple times, and what is being discussed here. The Ethiopian Jews are not related to this issue.
t1_dt489rf	1	*	Borders are solid lines. 
t1_dt3xf4h	0	*	Well that's really free now isn't it? When you got the free option to leave and get killed in whatever country you fled from? What's stupid is how you think they are free to leave.
t1_dt3ptta	1	*	That's the point they're making. The pilots were not limited to simply refusing due to legal maneuverings, but took real principled stands.
t1_dt2zrjt	0	*	There are plenty of black people in the country. You would know if you've ever been there. 
t1_dt4ixsm	1	*	Shouldn't they have stayed in Britain and work to fix that country instead of immigrating then?
t1_dt3mejl	0	*	https://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/rp/rp1415/AsylumFacts  96% to 99% of asylum seekers arrived in Australia on international flights.

t1_dt3ao9t	0	*	Right on, can't back up your argument? Just start calling people SJW's, that'll show em!
t1_dt3h8c6	1	*	Don't confuse him with some sense
t1_dt3cbel	0	*	>Or one who is full of ~~themself~~ morals  Fixed that for you. 
t1_dt3daxj	0	*	Considering he was murdered by a security guard and a salvos worker, not really. Unless they're banning that security company and the Salvation Army from entering Australia all of a sudden?
t1_dt3bp5c	0	*	Haha, right on! Rest assured, ~~the no trial wasn't a reference~~ *I stand corrected*, but the 100 years in the dungeon was the other reference that I was alluding to!
t1_dt3cpst	1	*	Heard it was good. Decided to watch an episode, I now know more about moral philosophy than I ever wanted to.  I'm also now questioning my lack of spoiler tag while answering a question.
t1_dt3g4om	0	*	Yes I have. Fantastic film, horrendous blight on our history
t1_dt39ura	0	*	Bogus. :(
t1_dt5k1l6	0	*	Refugees can claim whatever rights they want. Doesn't change the fact that offshore detention is legal and will continue to happen until refugees get the message that they are not wanted.
t1_dt3g8oo	0	*	Well yeah, but people like to explicitly focus on Israel's actions when it literally happens all over the world, just by world powers much more powerful and less controversial
t1_dt3bbhu	1	*	Same to you. We are all complicit in the child armies of the congo.
t1_dt3fuze	0	*	Lol. Have you ever lived in Delaware? 
t1_dt45zos	1	*	He also took our word for twenty. 
t1_dt7mg8f	1	*	Some did, and so did many Germans.
t1_dt3aq92	1	*	There's a reason the CIA is the one torturing people and not the DoD... There's no way that would fly. 
t1_dt3eobx	1	*	Dam, that just might work.
t1_dt3tfb0	1	*	I can confirm Tamils have been coming to Australia for decades as refugees. They've been here so long that one of them was one of my high school teachers.
t1_dt3akt8	0	*	Ear and head were just fine 20 minutes ago when you looked up that first part, I imagine they're up to this task as well.
t1_dt3pyaj	1	*	Why not? Rwanda is one of the safest countries on the continent. 
t1_dt37ics	0	*	you can also make the argument that great britain and south africa invaded and occupied the african countries
t1_dt3dl81	1	*	It really depends on the situation to be honest. 
t1_dt3clfg	0	*	Depends.  If you're not enlisted, and it's not wartime, you can just resign, depending on circumstance.
t1_dt3mn54	0	*	Is it because they dont want to get caught and deported? 
t1_dt3p5e1	0	*	Yup, because otherwise it'd be incredibly easy for a dictator to control their population, just ban all passport and ID for non-loyalists.
t1_dt3snr9	1	*	Quite a large chunk given they control mecca and medina
t1_dt46aeg	1	*	Wont,sadly 
t1_dt5yvk0	0	*	The US has defined borders with Mexico, where's the border between Israel and Palestine? 
t1_dt3lqsj	0	*	Probably comparable to ZANLA and Rhodesia tbh
t1_dt39183	1	*	Does Manga count?
t1_dt4jckh	0	*	This would mean that all refugees in Europe from syria/iraq/Afghanistan are economic refugees.   
t1_dufn0nb	1	*	International Law is written by strong countries to suit their own interests. There is no moral backing to it.
t1_ds6e56w	0	*	WaPo and NYT can't tell the truth? But 4chan is some platform to be trusted?   lololol
t1_ds6kax9	1	*	Yeah! They'd never do the same thing here! Psh!

t1_ds6gesd	0	*	Except they didn't
t1_ds6cc4h	0	*	It's a fucking meme. Do you think people should be fined large amounts of money for posting memes? Do you think this woman was actually advocating what the meme said?

t1_ds6t75l	0	*	If you work for a privately owned company, it's happening. Depending on what kind of labor you do it might not be so bad that it's unbearable, but it's happening.
t1_ds6e982	1	*	It isnt a matter of external oppression (rules and regulations), but personal decency. The hacker known as 4chan has no such quality.
t1_ds87jju	1	*	You know what, just send it to Mark Zuckerberg. The man deserves our money.
t1_ds6e3mv	0	*	Yeah, so? 
t1_ds6doqa	1	*	This pretty much explains why they start of right-leaning.  Thanks for providing a living example.
t1_dsabt9y	0	*	Well, it's dumb to complain that it's somehow a new phenomenon, or indicative of American culture. The TV most people watch still isn't allowed to show that stuff
t1_ds6ecf8	1	*	The biggest mistake you can make about 4chan is **any** mistake you make about 4chan. We are everywhere! We are nowhere! We are legion! And we are coming...  *Yes, I'm holding for 4chan....?*
t1_ds6fg8w	0	*	It's not a matter of opinion. They aren't a monopoly by any definition. Economics or legal.

t1_ds6e4ys	0	*	Leftypol is even worse than 4chans pol most of the time. And I would steer clear of 8chan since they still have that CP problem while 4chan got rid of it

t1_ds7j0u6	1	*	fyi, the right was really into the unite the right rally, it was even posted on T_D.  They started pretending not to be into it when the neo nazi murdered someone 
t1_ds6cq1h	0	*	So who gets to decide where the boundary between jokes/satire and illegal speech lies? (god that term disgusts me more than the comment does) The government? If so we are already in a dark place.
t1_ds6er78	0	*	The sad part is it peaked about 10 years ago.  Granted I haven't been on in like 5 years, but some classic /b/ at 2:00am on a school night was the best.

t1_ds6buej	0	*	I already covered this in another post. How do you define hate speech? Because Germany defines it as even pretty benign criticism of their migrant policy.
t1_ds6mtdz	0	*	They should kinda know the consequences of prohibiting certain speech too, since that's what the nazis did. 
t1_ds6dv12	0	*	Wow youre delusional, its EASILY the biggest board, and its incredibly right wing

t1_ds6m1nb	0	*	I said it elsewhere but they only said most likely in regards to getting paid to do this. I was asking about everything that came before that.

t1_ds6d650	0	*	Sweden is pretty far from Central Europe. People will downvote nonsense talking about how Sweden is one step worse than a Syrian war zone. If youd ever been to Sweden youd know its bs. 
t1_ds6ejp4	0	*	Like an example of a company bribing the government? In general, they wouldn't spend so much money on lobbying if it didn't pay off. Businesses just don't do that.

t1_ds6jut6	1	*	Not all people I disagree with are Nazis, but all Nazis are people I disagree with. I don't pay enough attention to Shapiro to say anything about him.

t1_ds6x6wf	0	*	This popular line of thinking is on the same intellectual level as my kid couldve painted that. 
t1_ds7xyd1	1	*	Not as much as people from the US love to defend their country. The amount of posts defending the US against other countries based on complete nonsense is ridiculous.

t1_ds6m84o	0	*	Ok, fair enough. However, I suppose I don't understand where you disagree with me. Can you elaborate?
t1_ds6kwt6	0	*	The comment was not about legality, but whether it's OK. Plenty of awful things are legal.

t1_ds9vcgm	0	*	Not interested. You can google the tax plan if you'd like. There's plenty of evidence that it's nothing but tax breaks for the donor class.
t1_ds6e7gy	0	*	Yeah but the filth is so off putting that only radical individuals stick around which results in a hive-mind culture. Sure there is free speech but its not without its issues.
t1_ds6egyp	1	*	Rightleaning > traps according to CNN and the popular narrative these two things can't go together 
t1_ds77vaw	1	*	There was one about the Missionary Position and how it helps with fertilization.  There was funky music playing and even a cam inside the woman's vagina if I remember correctly. The whole shebang.

t1_ds74mb6	0	*	No, English is not my first language. It is just a example  of the rich big people/companies can make every law they want.
t1_ds6p4km	1	*	Sorry what? I have no idea what you are trying to say. Mostly because it has nothing to do with what i wrote.
t1_ds6ehg5	1	*	True enlightened gentlesirs don't need books when you can have jpegs of crime statistics made by neonazis.

t1_ds8v48c	0	*	lol Orwell was a socialist; he fought alongside Catalonian anarchists. I think you might've misunderstood his work. He was opposed to Marxism-Leninism, not socialism in general.
t1_ds6dqm4	1	*	Technically, the most seriousest.

t1_dshh6h2	1	*	I would join my local trade union if the wait for a single interviewing wasn't 6 months. And if I knew I wasn't going to be laid off 6 months later (lol)
t1_dsholot	0	*	right to work is something else, but people get it confused with at-will.  right to work just means you can't be compelled to join a union.
t1_dsi7qig	0	*	Is anyone saying that Tim Hortons should be invaded by the military?  No, theyre protesting and boycotting.  Free market.  So whats the problem?
t1_dshqnuq	0	*	This also works for pizza. Want your pizza delivered first? Be known as a good tipper. They may also accidentally include extras in the order.

t1_dsi2ku0	0	*	I am now going to attempt to tip every employee at Ball Fart
t1_dsi7cp5	0	*	I guess-- my point is you are subsidizing the company's payroll in either instance by paying for food and services.
t1_dshp18x	0	*	That's why they worked at Ball-Fart.
t1_dsjdmcr	0	*	Sorry but you can dislike tipping without firing employees for accepting tips
t1_dshy4yj	0	*	Employees can always quit without notice, doesn't matter if it's an at-will state or not.
t1_dshpwxr	1	*	Maybe you should actually read what I wrote if you came to that conclusion.
t1_dshw6jq	0	*	Whats wrong with that? They should know better than to take work while there is a strike going on.
t1_dsil82u	0	*	Bribery:  money taken to perform services or grant favors.  I'm shocked they haven't listed their basic income as a bribe.

t1_dshklrg	0	*	How the fuck can a law be unlawful? Do you not understand how words and legislation works? Unethical, maybe, but a law cannot, by definition, be unlawful. 
t1_dshjs02	1	*	It never happened to me so it never happened to anyone else ever!
t1_dshmkta	1	*	Depends on the state. Some states don't even require breaks and can allow employers to work employees 12 or more hours with zero breaks. 
t1_dshnrbx	1	*	No, the only federal rulings is what counts as a paid and unpaid break.
t1_dshp4wl	1	*	Weird timing for an I fucked your wife joke. 
t1_dsigdwi	1	*	fuck... I have been working for over 10 years at the same employer and just earned 4 weeks of vacation  a year
t1_dsi7ep5	1	*	I just don't find it that hard to tip I guess. A six of one half dozen of another scenario where more of my money is going directly to a server instead of a business is preferable to me.
t1_dshfp39	0	*	Oh no some random douche bag on the Internet is judging me for my marijuana use. U0001f644
t1_dsi0iv8	0	*	Where in the states can an employee not quit if they feel like? Because that sounds like slavery.

t1_duqwzsc	0	*	If you read the story it says the Iranian authorities got angry at her after she went to the Netherlands to help her daughter with a new kid
t1_dtvlqk9	1	*	The US refines the oil it imports, and then exports it to the EU.  If we stopped importing oil, and only refined domestic oil, we would produce enough to meet our own needs.  
t1_dtvfwxy	0	*	>China puts out more pollution than the U.S. by a fairly large margin  Mostly because EU countries outsourced their pollution.
t1_dtvybzk	0	*	How is km2 relevant?
t1_dtv44tz	0	*	They'd be mad either way since they were expecting the US to give out a lot of money. The difference is the US isn't breaking its word if it doesn't sign. 
t1_dtwo5dm	0	*	And we are hitting our targets without the accord.
t1_dtvgz45	0	*	I don't think the civil war was in 1984 dude...

t1_dtvdnon	1	*	When everyone else would kill a 100 to make a buck, gotta give props to the guy that stops at 9. International politics is anarchy.
t1_dtvptu6	0	*	Yes, even you are entitled to your views.  Edit: I just love how you called yourself an idiot. 
t1_dtv9kuj	0	*	Well were not getting arrested for criticizing Islam on Facebook (yet).  So, theres that.
t1_dtvkoxu	0	*	How do we punish murderers and people deliberately destroying the property of others or people who cause damage to nations and pollute the environment usually? Exactly the same way.
t1_dtvb9ox	1	*	Exactly, i thought it was common knowledge.
t1_dtv8shj	0	*	He doesn't believe in climate change or even understand the fundamentals of the agreement. Logical sense has little to do with it as far as I can tell.
t1_dtwoll5	0	*	How are absolute amounts of pollution relevant when comparing nations?
t1_dtwjx3d	1	*	Or a 2nd amendment nutbar let loose from a hotel or in a school
t1_dtw7i7l	1	*	Mine lmao. Go talk to India and China. And I was talking about Europe anyway.
t1_dtvg9qq	0	*	In a proper democracy, no government can pass laws that future governments cannot change.
t1_dtvmedx	1	*	If you have to use scare quotes, its probably not a great argument. 
t1_dtx1g8h	1	*	Why not? Both are holding policies hostage, like DACA and CHIP. You've had a few comments saying it's different this time, but you haven't said why you think so.
t1_dtwv4u9	1	*	The liberals in this country refer to that as whataboutism. 
t1_dtva8l4	0	*	Where did i state it as fact? The whole premis for your critique is non existant
t1_dtwodhz	0	*	Expand on that, please. I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. All that means is we buy more of their stuff than they do of our stuff.
t1_dtvp0ty	0	*	Ah OK. I don't know you from Adam, but I genuinely like your attitude and open mind. 
t1_dtvqe9o	0	*	EU became all of Europe in 2004, and in less than 15 years starts breaking apart in 2017. See the writing on the wall. European government barely lasted a decade. Its the beginning of over. 
t1_dtvb0tm	0	*	He needs some Democrats to vote Yea for bills to pass the Senate. It would allow him and the majority to force the minority to pass bills they usually try to stonewall, like immigration reform.
t1_dtvj7wo	0	*	It's called diplomacy. You show your willingness to work toward a common goal and try to stick to the agreement, even if non binding.
t1_dtvobnu	1	*	Having a bad day?
t1_dtwe7pj	1	*	Why would he present evidence to the court if hes not a lawyer 
t1_dtv9k9o	0	*	So youd rather be sitting in the restaurant waiting for your date, or your date to let you know ahead of time that they really dont want to see you anymore?
t1_dtvf3lq	0	*	I was assuming that they are not a citizen of an EU member state, which would mean the first sentence is wrong because the EU is not a single country. 
t1_dtvx34f	0	*	UK and Germany.
t1_dtvkpq1	0	*	For what?
t1_dtv97xo	1	*	This is a bad deal  Climate change isnt real   I get why you could confuse the two but these two phrases are different
t1_dtvecnr	0	*	Ukraine is an example of a non-NATO state being directly interfered with by Russia in a way they have never done with a NATO state. It proves that Russia is still a threat to isolated countries. 
t1_dtvbxv8	1	*	Which is completely irrelevant to whether we should ship $3b to third world dictators so they can implement climate projects with US taxpayer cash. 
t1_dtvk2u3	1	*	I have insurance that is affordable, I'm out a max of 5 grand a year. Tell me again how this is my fault?

t1_dtvryk0	1	*	Now you just try to save your face, sorry your argument was ridiculous and your defense of it is even worse. Cya. 
t1_dtvoe58	0	*	>dictatorial communist regime  Better than a corporate oligarchy brainwashing people into believing it's free and democratic.
t1_dtw2j48	0	*	So instead of going back on a non-binding agreement he's just not agreeing to it... and that's a problem?
t1_dtv94bu	0	*	oh c'mon, facts just spoil the argument...

t1_dtvp8d7	0	*	And when you include private donations.
t1_dtv7gkw	0	*	I'd rather someone back out of a deal when it's too late than stay in the deal then not follow through. Sure, I'll be pissed either way, but I know which one I would prefer.
t1_dsakltv	1	*	Yea.. the smart bombs aren't that smart just like op. 
t1_dsamhi8	0	*	Absolutely, for the most part but intelligence could be disinformation most likely from Russia. :D  
t1_dsroo90	1	*	No one is saying that lol. 
t1_dsru8qx	1	*	In both situations you have kids being severely abused by adults. From their perspective it's the same. 
t1_dssd25q	1	*	I'm saying putting a bomb on a kid in the middle East really isn't that much worse than systematically starving and torturing 13 kids like for their entire life. Different but same. 
t1_dsrr5yq	0	*	Idk man, some torture isn't better than instant death
t1_dsrtctg	0	*	Iraqis have been spared from homoerotic holiday cups unlike shithole California /s
t1_dtrmxxw	0	*	It's an article on FB about incest porn.  Are you arguing that religion cannot teach valuable lessons to kids?
t1_dttfbj2	0	*	Then I guess you won't be adding people to your kid's contact list. Which is fine. It's the responsible thing in your situation. 
t1_dtsw6rf	1	*	using real names for everything on line. Any sources that you can recommend to demonstrate what a mistake this is?
t1_dsxe4vd	0	*	I guess the majority of the mainstream media has fallen for it as well.  You have your work cut out for you on this one.  Good luck!
t1_dsxemop	1	*	He's mad that the world outside his bubble sees this as another laughable deflection from the investigation. 
t1_dsxf211	0	*	>Supporting your argument is even harder.
t1_dt1hpdn	1	*	Yep, unfortunately the reality of creating the new tesltra (NBN). It's got a new name but it's a lot like the old telstra.

t1_dtqu51m	1	*	Im pretty sure Zorro Astrian is a distant cousin of Ben Ghazi 
t1_dtr1xm3	1	*	The Saudi *are* the leaders. Saudi Arabia means Arabia, ruled by the Saudi (the Saud family). The people are Arabian.
t1_dul5oxf	1	*	You've already lost. There is nothing you can do but cause more civilians to die.
t1_dukbnz9	1	*	I can respect that
t1_dukyp2p	1	*	He gets away with it anyway. At this point its just throwing civilians into a meat grinder.
t1_dukddgg	1	*	Yeah i mean when you look at it its almost always FAR doing diffrent stuff here and there and rarely other groups 
t1_dueguzg	0	*	SAAB fighters are not even in the f 35 league !! they are not 5th generation jets and the f 35 does fly 
t1_dueh1n2	0	*	You mean to say the F35 has 100,000 flight hours without getting off the ground? That's even more impressive!
t1_duf1asw	1	*	I named 3 trade agreements and you focus on one as if its the only one. Thats why I think you are dense.  
t1_dtbopx8	1	*	indeed
t1_dt2gpoe	0	*	TFW you make a communist sperg out on reddit by pointing out that he lives in the kind of luxury that would make a 16th century european king jealous
t1_dt2pm5f	0	*	Just goes to show that no matter how far we go is never enough for some people.  You will never be happy.  So why bother even trying to please you?   
t1_dt44n9l	0	*	Yeah, that still has no effect an a persons own decisions when trying to achieve career goals
t1_dt304px	1	*	So you are threatening to take what you feel entitled to? 
t1_dt2kz8u	0	*	Record breaking standard of living doesn't sound exactly dystopian to me, but I guess that depends on how you define it.
t1_dt2jwsb	1	*	Concentration of wealth also means a concentration of power.
t1_dud0kdp	1	*	And people with power/intimidation rise to the top in Communism/Socialism. All economic systems have their flaws, and obviously history has shown socialism typically fails just like capitalism has/is.

t1_dudme3k	1	*	What race is someone if they choose to be orange? I am pretty sure he wasn't born orange? Can someone help me out, people from NY aren't naturally orange are they? 
t1_ducyhzq	0	*	It is a shitty system. But there's nothing to replace it.  Personally I think capitalism with some socialist features is the best way forward.
t1_ducqygr	0	*	If you think Trump's orange skin is because of his race, then well, I dunno, that's such a stupid idea that I'm speechless.
t1_ducxo7v	1	*	A pure system of any type is basically trash from the get-go. A mostly capitalist system with some equally applied regulations, however, is the best at propagating wealth and success. 
t1_dunaz65	0	*	Because it isn't working. I live in one of these utopia countries you talk about. We just have rampant knife crime and still have an illegal flow of guns. After handguns were banned here, crime rose

t1_dtfslto	1	*	I think immigration services do the best they can. They aren't God, though.  I agree we need poor people. I am saying we have enough here as is.  It's a heartless analysis to be fair.

t1_dscqh3b	1	*	Russian bot and allU0001f644 marginalize me more so you wont have to actually back up your claims. Theres a reason we stick to that sub. 
t1_dsbtsfo	0	*	I'm not actually sure the US would exchange nukes with Russia over Europe. I know that on paper they will, but does the US really care that much about Europe?
t1_dsc6z4j	1	*	Exactly.  As long as they're in economic competition with Russia, China isn't going to risk losing allies with the U.S., especially if full-scale war knocks Russia down a peg.

t1_dsc73up	0	*	This thread is just everyone projecting American foreign policy on china and coming to conclusions based on that.  Forgetting that China is playing a different game entirely 
t1_dsdq7m4	1	*	That's just power projection, those islands are de facto aircraft carriers but only useful for protecting themselves not really for offensive purposes. 
t1_dsbxquu	0	*	The Vietnam we fought agianst did that?

t1_dsbtnjf	0	*	Swap over to manufacturing weapons of war, win, and play a major role in restructuring the US government and writing a new constitution that requires Chinese imports.
t1_dsc77au	1	*	Yep, and out of the three it's easily the worst. Major disappointment even, IMO.

t1_dsc1z6v	1	*	A war where the US disregards laws of war would be a blood bath for whoever we inflict that on. 
t1_dsbxnzr	0	*	I think it's questionable that Russia could compete against NATO in terms of Naval power. I think their Navy would be overwhelmed pretty quickly. 
t1_dsc0mh3	0	*	I mean the US hasn't won in the sense that its still fighting so it hasn't accomplished what it set out to do. Could be either imo.
t1_dsc3u1w	0	*	Bad example, they are talking 1vs1 there.
t1_dsca653	1	*	Seems to check out. Maybe it is a slam dunk.
t1_dsbvlnw	1	*	and then everyone stood up and clapped.
t1_dsc47pm	1	*	NATO would roll over Russia even without US intervention. You're vastly overestimating Russia capabilities.
t1_dsbwt53	1	*	Puke Here Beckons? NATO would be inviting Russia to vomit all over Europe?
t1_dsc0oo1	1	*	I have no idea.

t1_dsc9cpt	0	*	> the pen video  I'm not familiar, what is this?

t1_dsbvc1n	1	*	Now to retire to glorious dacha in fantastik red state Michigan!
t1_dschoez	1	*	That depends. If the border conflicts with India and the new alliance with Pakistan destabilize Asia, China might be in no position to become involved in a European conflict one way or another.
t1_dsbv8o4	0	*	does India count for nought in asia ? it has been tussling against china.
t1_dsc0qsd	1	*	They do, but you can't use nuclear weapons against a nuclear armed superpower.  At least not without getting all your own people killed.
t1_dsbs6tx	0	*	Its definitely arrogant. In fact I would say that America hasnt really won ANY war since ww2, and those conflicts are stalemates at best.

t1_dsbwfv9	1	*	what I'm saying is that to definitely say NATO DOES IT TOO you need to demonstrate that. I'm open to the possibility if anyone can prove it...
t1_dscz579	0	*	I mean considering that the current president was basically put in place by Russian propaganda, I don't think Russians should complain about it. 
t1_dscmoa6	1	*	You're correct that's exactly what happend.

t1_dv03c94	0	*	I think there's a difference between being a tourist and illegally entering a border. It may have been an honest mistake, but that doesn't change the fact. 
t1_dv061m0	1	*	Unless there is an economic reason like in Libya, Iraq, (both threatened to upend the Petro-Dollar paradigm) or Afghanistan (heroin and rare earth metals) there will be no intervention 
t1_dv01od3	0	*	The dictionary doesnt define Black as human either. But the UN does.  Genocide = extinguishment of a people or culture

t1_dv01zjh	0	*	Um, we do. Maybe not the stereotypical, comical accents...but regular Americans and Canadians are hard to tell apart. (if you can't see the AR-15 slung over one's shoulder, that is)

t1_dvpl44w	0	*	I'm not advocating for taking from one group and giving to another, but ignoring the massive inequality won't solve anything either. 
t1_duzziwz	0	*	The US has better checks and balances against the president doing truly crazy things. (Although those checks and balances erode by the term.)
t1_dv0f7pt	0	*	Ok man, sure   EDIT: For the rest of you, here's a just a short clip of what it's like: https://youtu.be/WCLJRVbaMyQ

t1_dv025od	0	*	People like a guy who says he will solve all their problems.  There is no message that is more enticing to a man than that his misfortunes were caused by someone else.

t1_duzwsvm	0	*	Great, let's punish anyone who has a family member that once committed a crime. 
t1_dv04cdy	1	*	Maybe she was friends with you because you were the only person who didn't want to ask questions about apartheid.
t1_dv0uuuo	0	*	Judging Trump by a minority of his mentally ill loud mouth supporters is like judging the Democrats on what happened at Evergreen College.

t1_dv05max	1	*	Of course it does, it was a British colony. That also means they have the industry to produce some sort of sleeping gas to make sure the residents aren't uncertain. 
t1_duzyyfw	0	*	Racial inequality not apartheid is fueling this

t1_dv0bu52	1	*	Source on admission?
t1_dv0r1bj	1	*	My point isnt that it isnt covered at all. My point is Le Pen saying the opposite would be a much larger story with much more attention paid to it. It would also mean the end of her political career. 
t1_dv00kov	1	*	No then we'll be interfering with internal affairs of a nation. 
t1_duzzlmy	0	*	Being tribal isn't a fault
t1_dv1i4dl	1	*	That's why I'm suggesting why someone suggested, a tax based on land amount and not race. If you own shitload of land, you get shitload of taxes. Problem solved.

t1_duzy23s	1	*	if they cannot stop the government from taking their land and possibly other assets down the line are they really ruling anything?
t1_dv004ez	0	*	Except for the fact the apartheid state was maintained until 91 and so 'THEY' are much more direct beneficiaries of colonization, oppression, organized and systematic subjugation. 
t1_dv0b2xc	0	*	Venezuela is ranked as the 14th most corrupt country in the world. Most of the 13 above them are capitalist countries. Corruption happens across the political spectrum.
t1_dv03ade	1	*	Thank you very much!
t1_duzvvww	0	*	But this is 2018, insulting and calling names and flinging shit is how we debate important issues.
t1_dv07yoc	1	*	It depends who controls the armed forces, who is better organized. Population sizes is just part of the picture. The alawis in Syria were 10% of the population.
t1_dvobxnd	0	*	You don't understand whats happening and feel the need to argue out loud. I didn't insult you, but you are ignorant.
t1_dv0cv4t	0	*	some people prefer national liberation over economic development, it's why people prefered independence even when their countries weren't as developed post-independence.
t1_duzyopf	0	*	I never said i agree with it, I'm just explaining what someone else meant when they said that.
t1_dv0elwp	0	*	They are saying, taking their money out of SA is near impossible.  So they will be destitute if they leave SA.
t1_dv04mrn	0	*	We are not. We are trying to give back opportunity to 4% of the population. There are many ways to do it. We are not being impoverished as a result. 
t1_dv5f74k	0	*	You'd be wrong.  They're 'colored', not Bantu black.  They are actually quite [genetically distinct](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khoisan#Biology_and_genetic_studies) from blacks.
t1_dv1cj6w	1	*	Yes, true. But I would say that whether it goes one way or another now pretty much entirely hinges on how this issue is dealt with.
t1_duzxdph	1	*	What illegal immigrants are Muslims? 
t1_dv05bmx	0	*	Dude read a history book. Like i dont even agree with the guy you responded to but the things youre saying are objectively false. Also you realize Africa isnt one monolithic place right?
t1_dv13fh6	1	*	Dunno why you are being downvoted. You've hit the nail right on the head. It's not about colour so much as it is about education and experience.
t1_duzze5g	1	*	Ya, North Korea will do that if you do something deemed disloyal, not for just being a certain color.
t1_duzyaoe	0	*	U0001f602U0001f602U0001f923. Im perfectly in support of helping anyone who needs it. Go back to Tumblr if youre looking for the perpetually oppressed crowd.

t1_dv0prfo	1	*	Good perspective. Thank you. Sources?
t1_dv00r7r	1	*	Lol I see.. I was a bit confused about what you were getting at. Perhaps I should look into evolutionary psychology courses because this is a fascinating topic and I'd love to learn more.
t1_duzzxf3	1	*	We'll probably get grey gooed by some pissed-off third-world dictator, or something, but let's try to stay optimistic!
t1_dv012o1	1	*	According to the UN, that counts as genocide 
t1_dv01yye	1	*	You're right. It's not when that they care, it's if they were killed in the most productive fashion as to benefit THE PEOPLE.

t1_dv04uyi	1	*	I did not endorse the plan.

t1_dv00w6y	0	*	Interestingly enough, just because the guy who proposed it was a Marxist Leninist doesn't mean that everyone who voted for it was.

t1_dv0nilr	1	*	You're not wrong, just calling out quite an open-to-interpretation kinda statement, but I get what you mean :)
t1_dv04n4u	0	*	Do you have a source for that claim? Because I've never encountered a person who believes that and I'd like to see some reliable information proving its as significant as you say if it is infact. 
t1_dv01tfj	1	*	Just making a statement  I am not against anti-discrimination laws  I am heavily against laws that benefit anyone unfairly based on race/gender/sexual orientation

t1_ds6f6xq	1	*	My bad.
t1_dt7cvr2	0	*	The purchase was for the Louisiana territory not the state of Louisiana. They bought it for almost nothing (a few hundred million in modern dollars) and the territory is like 1/3 of the USA

t1_dt74nml	0	*	I bet even if nk collapses without war, the people being suddenly told everything is a lie and the Kims are Hitler would lead to widespread rejection and mass riots.
t1_dt7hrf2	1	*	Tucker max? Is that you?
t1_dt79h05	0	*	You know they wish every day their forefathers had just made it south at this point. They know about the outside world now. They know NK sucks dick.

t1_dt7gd32	0	*	Honest question though...did you go to the Winchester while it blew over?
t1_dt7l4wc	1	*	Because the level of detail in which Americans are taught their history is much higher than Europeans. Otherwise its not possible to cover everything in the last 2500 ish years
t1_dt79s1y	0	*	I have no idea what a newfag is, but that's a really stupid word and exactly the kinda shit I would expect from that place.

t1_dt7giy1	1	*	Bad news for you, bud.  That want me.
t1_dt7h2ww	0	*	Not enough native history gets taught in the US. These people existed here for thousands of years before too.
t1_dt7cbdl	0	*	What are you even talking about. Comparing Trump to NK's dictator? Saying that Trump is a regime? Are you soft in the head?
t1_dt7o4qq	0	*	Are the borders open with Middle Eastern war torn countries? What counts as open borders?
t1_dt7dqc0	0	*	Has that brought any negative consequences though? 
t1_dt7m97y	0	*	They might have a decapitation plan.  The only thing we know for certain is that the NK problem is getting worse, fast.
t1_dt7aex9	0	*	It's probably an improvement from the living conditions in NK as it stands. 
t1_dt7ierb	1	*	Holy shit
t1_dt7dfpo	0	*	Well, at this moment, he's looking at a way out of nuclear war with the west and SK. It's not a bad thing. Threatening him with execution won't be conducive to the event going on right now.
t1_dt7fsa8	0	*	Currency war with China, undue tension with NK and the EU, Canada taking the lead in American trade deals.   Nope. Looking like the beginning of a Newt Gingrich novel.

t1_dt7av9z	1	*	41 pledged that he wouldnt sign a bill raising taxes. And you realize Steve Bannon had his clearance revoked almost immediately and is no longer even in government?
t1_dt7ciju	1	*	It's like you haven't even heard of capitalism, 50% is very very optimistic. 
t1_dt7ewo9	1	*	Kim Jong Il also called for unification. It doesn't mean he wasn't a horrible person.
t1_dt7eg0n	0	*	Just like saddam and WMDs.  He doesnt have to have them but everyone thought he did.  
t1_dt7eho8	0	*	Oh yeah.  Just like the North Koreans agreed to in the 90s?
t1_dt6yxqj	0	*	Haha hes just making fun of OP's original typo which was corrected

t1_dt7zpl4	1	*	Honestly not sure. I only know a little bit about HK. 
t1_dt80451	0	*	We know when they are testing nuclear weapons without even being in the country because the shockwave goes around the earth.
t1_dt6z3d7	1	*	I think he means in the extreme sense any nuclear capable nation has the ability to rule any nation without nuclear capabilities, not that those nations arent sovereign right now.
t1_dt8mpfu	1	*	Wow..  I'm surprised that google translater actually did a decent job here. They really improved on it. I understood everything.

t1_dt7diyl	0	*	Looks like I'm arguing with a thinker over here.  
t1_dt7azjv	0	*	I'm basing it on how fast South Korea seemed to have developed I'm the last 20 years and anecdotal evidence like that is good enough for a general statement in normal conversation. 
t1_dt7le25	1	*	You mean you can't believe the UK returned something it took in the first place?
t1_dt7ev51	1	*	Beers and weed make anything interesting.
t1_dt7cuqc	1	*	I think that's a practical challenge that can be addressed with some careful planning. It wouldn't have to be unified overnight. It could be a 50-year long process with gradual integration. 
t1_dt7epwz	0	*	I mean only one nation on Earth has actually used Nukes in anger...
t1_dt752lc	0	*	Can't the Chinese fishermen be seen as an extension of the government because the government is subsidising them? Therefore the Chinese government is waging wars on multiple countries.
t1_dt76nku	0	*	You think US troops on the north of the peninsula isn't a huge factor in this to China and Russia?

t1_dt7g44d	1	*	I do, I swear, they're just all back in America.  Right now, I'm one of three employees at a hotel in the middle of the Australian outback.  Cabin fever is real, dude. 
t1_dt7lyup	0	*	Language is so interesting. Even through a Reddit comment I could sorta distinguish whether you were a native or not. I wonder if other languages have similar traits. 
t1_dt7h5kl	1	*	But there are no other colonies now anyway, at least not in any meaningful way.  It, as a singular event, didn't shape our history as much as everything else on the curriculum.

t1_dt7a9sm	0	*	Yeah, but then they've got an ass load of infrastructure to build back up 
t1_dt8du0q	0	*	Nowhere in that article does it explain any particular crimes against humanity. Such intellectual rigor, no wonder you cited Wikipedia. ucc9cuc870uad6d ubc14ubcf4 
t1_dt7lizx	0	*	What makes Canadians better than Americans?  As far as I can tell,  the only difference between the two is the government themselves.

t1_dt7f1hp	1	*	Yeah, China would sabotage any attempts at unification.
t1_dt7ay5c	0	*	I understand what you're saying but it's not like it hasn't been done before. Ever heard of Oppenheimer or Unit 731?

t1_dtdihno	0	*	No I do, he's never going to peacefully step down. That's undeniable. That's what I've been trying to say.
t1_dt7dnpn	1	*	Sounds a lot like what Trump, the republicans and Putin are doing actually. With a little help from the FCC.
t1_dt7f0n5	0	*	War against NK is genocide, nothing less. You might as well claim that you want to drop a baby from a skyscraper but without killing them.
t1_dt8g0ax	0	*	Link? 
t1_dt7j64m	1	*	Exactly. Much more exciting than the stale old regular one that I used to play which had very predictably outcomes. Now, it's much more of a challenge to stay on my usual win streak. Have fun!

t1_dt7azz0	1	*	You won't believe what happened next!

t1_ds28yuz	0	*	Yes but if the U.S is diminished from multiple wars and has mostly pulled out of SK, what happens when Kim drops nukes across the south and invades with 2 million men?
t1_ds13nkj	0	*	No I don't think they would do that.
t1_ds1b2d4	1	*	There used to be 21 (they'd planned to be build over 100 but the Cold War ended), but one of them crashed.
t1_ds15v52	0	*	US invasion of Iraq?  They're the ones with the nukes. And 'rational actor' doesn't really describe the current leader. 
t1_ds15q2o	0	*	And you see nothing wrong with nuking your entire northern border?  The one where winds usually blow _towards_ you?
t1_ds1vykr	1	*	Hey if it works
t1_ds196dc	1	*	That's hilarious. Trump is incapable of behaving anything like a statesman. 
t1_ds15hpd	0	*	Grow the fuck up.
t1_ds2ed4h	0	*	Do you agree that, if this is the case, it is worthwhile to hate the USA?
t1_ds2m6v8	0	*	I think you are reaching if you think I am serious.
t1_ds1b8ki	0	*	You live in Kansas? I bet you bet on a lot of things
t1_ds1any9	0	*	Well they did stop after those two at least so it's a good enough example
t1_ds110cx	0	*	>Sooo, all of NATO is fanatically militaristic  Are you stupid?
t1_ds16d05	0	*	Trump plays the North Korea Card: If US has the North Korea card, gain 2 victory points. Otherwise, US gains the North Korea card face down and unavailable for immediate play. 
t1_ds15ffr	1	*	You have been demoted mod of /r/China
t1_ds175cz	1	*	There is no greater danger than underestimating your opponent.
t1_ds15rcv	1	*	And prospered.
t1_ds1685s	1	*	I think dehumanizing him detracts from the reality of the situation. Hitler might have been on all sorts of drugs, but he had countless everyday people propping him up.
t1_ds16897	0	*	I don't think he's stupid. He's well educated and well traveled. He's just a douche. 
t1_ds14i9w	0	*	What are the odds NK will be able to fool our system?
t1_ds15mna	1	*	I wasn't trying to add more discussion, just trying to help someone fix a typo so their post is more easily understood.
t1_ds142sy	1	*	And MSNBC is basically an extension of Nancy Pelosis dick.   /s
t1_ds17hhg	0	*	Speak for yourself
t1_ds15bat	0	*	Yes, refusing to engage in diplomacy is being a bully. 
t1_ds15me0	1	*	I made a typo dude and he pointed it out. Chill. I'm glad he pointed it out.
t1_ds1aaxv	0	*	> They definitely have free press.  >Most of it is censored  Uh... by its very definition, a censored press is not a free press.  A lack of censorship is what makes a free press. 
t1_ds17qoh	0	*	Were our relations with China ever this bad pre-Nixon?  I know we didn't acknowledge them for a long time but I'm not aware of any overt hostility.
t1_ds178di	1	*	And look how much damage he caused. You don't need to be a genius to cause a lot of mayhem.
t1_ds17lm0	1	*	Thanks Clinton, Bush & Obama
t1_ds18ffu	1	*	I wouldn't say it's got a low success rate. A lot of the launches were designed to test specific systems/upgrades rather than testing intercept capability, even during the intercept tests.
t1_ds17dlj	1	*	I mean if 50% is the best we can do, I'll take it over 0%, that's for damn sure.
t1_ds1em48	1	*	Agreed, Tories are always treated more harshly than Labour etc
t1_ds192bc	1	*	I second Politico. They dont take sides, they just analyse the consequences of a given political move. The WaPo is good too, although they tend to have a left bias sometimes. 
t1_ds17nck	1	*	win win
t1_ds1ci2t	1	*	The house always has an edge.
t1_ds16fbq	0	*	Okay, say everything you've stated is set in stone. Now what of the USA's bigger relationship with China and the surrounding locations?
t1_ds164fn	0	*	I might actually get something done for once!
t1_ds1d2vl	0	*	And yet they never have, almost like they are simply threats.  And no I don't support NK, just pointing out that NK doesn't want to become a nuclear crater. 
t1_ds17yxs	1	*	AEGIS systems are installed on board Navy ships, not all of them, but enough are active and deployed in the 7th Fleet AOR that I think it'll be a solid primary defense. 
t1_ds1m4kw	1	*	Nobodys suggesting that lifting sanctions would liberate the NK people, but the world is an inherently safer place if every country achieves nuclear proliferation 
t1_ds176dq	1	*	What could Reuters possibly have done to offend you? 
t1_ds1m0gp	1	*	Dubya's actions were rational if the motivation was to benefit the military industrial complex. 
t1_ds18h6i	1	*	They have a state news network but no other news networks outside of it. 
t1_ds1ewtw	1	*	I live in Delaware, why you gotta blow our cover like that!
t1_ds1es1v	0	*	Not weighing in here, just commenting that the missiles were not necessarily armed. In that regard, it's not terribly different than a space program.
t1_ds19ene	1	*	Only since 2008 - the Reuters subsidiary is still headquartered in London, and is much more a British business than a Canadian one.
t1_ds15moa	0	*	No they dont. No news comes from a North Korean source that isnt approved by the gov.
t1_ds1anwj	0	*	I am not aware of Robert McNamara advocating nuclear action against China. Do you have a source for that?
t1_ds18095	0	*	I live in LA please no 
t1_ds23v10	0	*	That was sort of my question for you mate. 
t1_dtlcnns	0	*	Oh what a huge gulf of difference to people kicked out of their homes so jewish people can live there instead  Jesus fuckin Christ
t1_dt7cadj	0	*	i wonder what part of Dirceu foi condenado sem provas, i misunderstood. 
t1_du3l7it	0	*	DPRK has WMD's because its the only thing stopping your regime from starting yet another war.
t1_dsf86ot	1	*	What about those who are neither? You are essentially saying it's impossible to learn anything here, which is not exactly true...
t1_dsett4p	0	*	Awwww look at this scholarly piece of reasoning. I suggest you write  in a peer review journal. xo
t1_dsh1mnu	0	*	Facts don't care about your feelings.
t1_dsek4hh	1	*	Get out of here with your rational, objective analysis of well known but hard to admit realities.  We just want to hate on Russians because Russians.
t1_dse0cxz	0	*	What?
t1_dsf0y0o	0	*	Im not saying we do that though. 
t1_dsdsohl	0	*	Unfortunately that was bound to happen eventually.  Can you really blame colonists for carrying pathogens when they had little to no understanding of microbiology?
t1_dsf4qvy	1	*	Ohhh, yeah, I read about that. Interesting program. Of course I'm not sure how useful it is.   People can be implicitly biased in a test but be aware enough of it to make efforts to counteract it.
t1_dsdswdc	1	*	fucking nazi puritans bringing biological warfare maliciously on the poor native americans
t1_dse7vod	1	*	That's a good point, and I wouldn't be surprised if there was one, but I couldn't find anything.
t1_du2lhd4	1	*	League of Legends.
t1_du1lo38	0	*	It's not tyranny when the government is directly involved with lifting multiple tens of millions of people out of poverty in short periods of time. 
t1_du2vv6m	0	*	I always thought a base requirement for communism was workers ownership of the means of production.  Thank you for informing me.
t1_du1mr7t	0	*	Absolutely agree, it's tempting and a lot of Western nations will probably tighten their economic dependence on China over time.
t1_du1ouil	0	*	China has bad human rights, they have black sites  So does the USA in multiple sites  GOALPOSTS REEEE  Fuck off with your propaganda.
t1_du21aj7	0	*	Sure, but it's not hard to see how bad the CCP is.
t1_du9m97b	1	*	The UN doesn't call countries third world, they classify them as developed/developing. Regardless, perhaps you'd like to provide a source to your claims at some point?
t1_du2oej5	0	*	So name some, and compare it to what the US has done in the 21st century. 
t1_du2lu0s	1	*	USA hate doesn't come up much in Western media is closer to fact I think. And that we don't frequent media platforms of non-English countries.
t1_du1rx1u	1	*	My bad I misread your response to Tearakan
t1_du2plpa	1	*	It's the video game of the past few years, similar to world of warcraft at it's height
t1_du1qi95	0	*	No interest in doing so. It's better to boast about it only when it's too late to reverse it. 
t1_du1s1q2	1	*	It'd not advice.  
t1_du4e8el	1	*	Ok cool
t1_dstdaag	0	*	Which, again, is your own personal interpretation of what I said.  Don't put words in my mouth.  We're done here.  Have a nice day.
t1_dtom23t	1	*	Thats fair, yeah. I can see both sides of the issue myself, having lived in BC for a long time. 
t1_dsbh5ew	1	*	Bangers are not grenades, although they are still really powerful.
t1_dsbj06m	0	*	So what? Two attacks per month? Thats not common
t1_dsbhlna	1	*	Thanks!
t1_dsbiyeh	0	*	I didnt say Poland. 
t1_duyc75h	0	*	Yes, considering that not all media is propaganda.
t1_dst1fj2	0	*	your Bank can be robbed also.
t1_dssv4ga	0	*	>can easily be stolen   Because people are dumb with their computers and blindly trust things.      Also ever heard of getting mugged? Robbing a bank? Ransom? 
t1_dst4wyn	0	*	Except other currencies are based loosley on a countries gold stockpile. Crypto has nothing of value holding it up but other peoples demand.  Good luck. Hope you make money
t1_dssxkkn	0	*	Why are magic the gathering cards worth 100s of dollars ?  Because people will pay it. Same as bitcoin. 
t1_dstcysg	0	*	You're being petty.  Wtf is it to you if we invest in crypto.  No skin of you're add unless you're jealous but can't bring yourself to do the same.
t1_dstj9f3	1	*	It's because a lot of people are trading with the notion that if things go bad they can just Tether out and ride through the storm. 
t1_dssud05	1	*	Actually, six maths are worth $87.39, in 2017 dollars. Checkmate, statist!
t1_dst3uw4	1	*	Exactly the point. If you leave your money on an exchange you are being careless with security. As you are if you leave your wallet in the park.
t1_dst3f2g	0	*	Bitcoin's dominance has been sliding for a while as alts take hold. There would also be a large amount of currency waiting on exchanges to buy back in.
t1_dst283c	0	*	Those are pretty words, could you please post an article that explains that? Nothing I have read really suggests something so revolutionary but I only keep half an eye on crypto currency.
t1_dst1vlb	1	*	I don't keep a lot of cryptocurrency on the exchange for this very reason.
t1_duz2zvh	0	*	I'd still like to hear absolutely everything she has to say.
t1_duzy8oc	0	*	Again, Americans' inability to decouple prostitute from sex slave is not my problem.
t1_dtvcbw6	0	*	https://youtu.be/sQB2NjhJHvY
t1_duyfici	0	*	He wasnt the president at the time and everyone who was indicted was fired beforehand.
t1_duy7g11	0	*	Yes we would have. We heard about Russian meddling as far back as summer 2016. Think long and hard about that. 
t1_duxra5t	0	*	Funny how none of what you said proves anything else you've said, or vindicates the horses vagina you call your president
t1_duye2xt	0	*	> Yes, because we all know that making it harder tyo vote never makes people throw up their hands and say fuck it.   I certainly hope it does for the people who weren't legally eligible.
t1_dtu0yyn	0	*	>I don't understand what the problem is.  exactly.
t1_dsy855y	0	*	I already addressed the science, if you want to believe in a vast conspiracy of hundreds of thousands of scientists, and billions of measurements then feel free.
t1_dscnngk	0	*	You made the claim, it's up to you to provide the evidence to support it.
t1_dscmz48	0	*	How about you provide a source for your utterly baseless assertion?
t1_dscf8wt	0	*	Potentially yes.  Unless Kim is able to transition the nation into something a little less autocratic, where propaganda is less critical to his ongoing survival.
t1_dsd5xkh	1	*	You are naive bordering on dumb.
t1_dscjqbe	0	*	Spoils of WWII...we could have taken it, but we dont do that. North Korea would own you on your own. You sure use a lot of our equipment for being so great.  
t1_dt86hsx	0	*	Yeah, of the four examples I cited, only one is from the Cold War. The US-led Haitian coup wasn't even ten years ago. The Yemeni genocide is going on right now.
t1_dt8dz6k	1	*	Yea, I was CLEARLY 100% serious, no sarcasm at all, no siree 
t1_dv2xig9	1	*	That community is reddit 
t1_dv2yu20	0	*	why are you obsessed with Israel? 
t1_dv3cgy0	0	*	Because that is what ISIS is for, T_D isn't for organizing terrorist attacks, what a bad comparison.
t1_dv3f0jn	0	*	\-liar 
t1_dv2uwe0	0	*	I hope English isn't your first language.  
t1_dv2zb4c	0	*	It is literally impossible to hack the voting machines, you would have to organize a mass break in to where they were kept, at multiple locations in multiple states, and change their code.
t1_dv2pqqi	0	*	what i said was not wrong. we do find it funny, it's a very subjective thing which can't really be wrong.
t1_dv34gg5	1	*	You might need to call 9-1-1 cause I think you're having a Hate Stroke
t1_dv2y33x	0	*	No other country is doing what Russia is, and definitely not to the US.   Putin is going to pay when we get rid of the orange puppet.
t1_duwyav5	1	*	I'm glad to hear that. I just still worry for everyone involved in this. It's coming way to close for me to open hostilities. Thank you for at least somewhat easing my concerns.
t1_dtx1i8t	0	*	Nope. Socialist relations predominate (though of course Capitalist relations exist as well), and Capitalists lack political authority. 
t1_dtxq25b	1	*	It's called NEO. 
t1_dtxcen1	1	*	I agree with most of this, but I doubt that the People's Assembly will be in control.
t1_dtx92ra	0	*	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4WwNg8ywEuQ  Here is the side by side comparison.  https://nyaa.si/view/822339  Here's where I got it.
t1_dtx9rhp	1	*	Finally someone with logic and brains assessing China
t1_dtx8urz	1	*	I'll look for the link for you hold on.
t1_dtxvcvc	0	*	Developing or developed country doesn't matter. There is no wealth inequality in communism. 
t1_dv3jbdk	0	*	I was going to say something about MI18 but couldn't recall what it was, read the page (the correct one, not your link) and saw that it was unused, I think there is some idea that it isn't.
t1_dv348mv	1	*	Allways allowed and encouraged as part of 5 eyes between the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Almost all Intel gathered by one is shared with the other 4. 
t1_dv33y2e	0	*	I think that's well known to be not just a rumor. 
t1_ducyuvn	0	*	You do want nukes though. Germany particiates in nuclear Sharing of it's own volition and every government for 60 years. Germany currently has 20 or so nukes at a base outside Cochem.
t1_ducgsh2	0	*	Ok then explain what Russia would gain by invading Germany (through your imaginary land border).
t1_dud7dj3	1	*	You clearly have no idea about military logistics.   
t1_duckh5y	0	*	Well, it is ingrained in our history. We lost 2 world wars, one of them in a way that we learned to never engage in war again if possible. 
t1_ducpgle	0	*	The world would be a lot more peaceful if everyone thought like that. Not sure how you think that's sad?
t1_dud5no8	0	*	> nor want we any in our country  Correct me if I'm wrong but the US has placed nukes in your country, or were they withdrawn?
t1_ducnmkl	1	*	thank youfo making me laugh
t1_ducwl18	0	*	LOW ENERGY France can't invade a country in another hemisphere. SAD!  Like, dude, why would you even want that?
t1_ducw988	0	*	You only have to make payments if you earn over 21,000 and they are written off fully after 30 years. They do not count towards your credit, or other checks, and there is no penalty for non payment.
t1_ducwaxn	0	*	The terms are so favourable that I would take out 1000 student loans if I could keep the money
t1_due3z22	0	*	OK, sorry if I was a bit abrupt there. I live with chronic depression myself, so I tend to get snappy when I think people are minimising it.
t1_dsqb2g6	0	*	He's just mad because his girlfriend is Toulouse.
t1_dsrnqv3	1	*	San Diego Miramesa checking in. 25 minutes for 3 miles in rush hour traffic

t1_dsqsdzv	0	*	Where are they saying that?
t1_dsqj2a7	1	*	Whoooooossshhhhhh
t1_dsqxdvj	1	*	3 hours no traffic. 2.5 speeding. 2 hours flat if you don't give a flying fuck.
t1_dsqjge3	0	*	Drive from Paris to Barcelona? Why on earth would you drive? 
t1_dsr277g	1	*	I know I was being pedantic realistically the largest distances commonly traveled are in the mainland US and the Dutch, British, And French Caribbean territories. Plus Tahiti and Hawaii. 
t1_dsrx753	0	*	Proving what point?
t1_dsr3agw	1	*	*FallOut 3 theme plays*
t1_dsrkfhm	1	*	Entering the US is a fucking nightmare as a foreign passport holder. I've been to 32 countries total. The US is one of the few I won't go to again unless things drastically change.
t1_dsq59my	0	*	There's a reason all the rich Asians and MENA people send their kids to University in the US, and not Asia or Germany or Sweden.
t1_dsq4bqz	1	*	That fucking sucks, thanks.
t1_dsqy4wm	0	*	Yeah, so this article would make more sense if they used numbers of people traveling to the EU from outside the EU.  Or do we only count EU countries as a whole when it makes number go in their favor?
t1_dsrw6jz	0	*	But the US doesn't have the crime Russia does.
t1_dsqsrcs	1	*	/r/MapsWithoutNZ?
t1_dsrb74y	1	*	More than enough pee.
t1_dsqd5pj	0	*	How many tropical islands does Norway have?
t1_dsq4pdo	0	*	I did Nantes see that coming!
t1_dsrandr	1	*	No you don't. You just need ID.
t1_dsrm7pg	1	*	>you cant ski in England  You cant visit medieval castles in America...  If you meant that America has a more diverse landscape, then of course. But in terms of diverse tourist spots, of course not
t1_dsqqq6e	1	*	So I went to a music festival in Spain. All of the bands from up north were very red. I think they all got sun burns, lol.   Edit: I also got burned. Solidarity in skin cancer!
t1_dsr9pyj	1	*	Unfortunately, you absolutely do. 
t1_dss1i5l	0	*	It's insane that the US is still #3 in international tourism then
t1_dsrvtgl	1	*	This is important because saying, I was born in [Nancy] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nancy,_France) takes it to a whole new level. 
t1_dsqk14n	0	*	Yeah, you just drive on the highway and you'll see a sign saying you're in another country, that's it, it's pretty cool.
t1_dsqm1ai	0	*	That sounds exactly like what people in South Florida call '[snowbirds](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CGqzcCLWgAMCLKr.jpg)', AKA people who migrate from New York/New Jersey/etc in the winter. 
t1_dsq4fwl	0	*	must be bliss...
t1_dsr06d8	1	*	There's places in Europe that are like that, too :)
t1_dsr9rth	1	*	Depends on the country you are travelling from and/or how brown you are.
t1_dsqoc4f	1	*	Honestly, it's even easier than any state to state travel outside of NY to/from NJ or CT.
t1_dsqe4yn	0	*	it very well may. 
t1_dsqrcir	0	*	In no traffic, sure. It's 2.75 hr right now. On a holiday.
t1_dsr7fz7	1	*	Guiri gamba
t1_dsq52de	0	*	Caen you stop this discussion is getting Toulon!
t1_dsquviz	0	*	Honestly, I don't believe you. You can't seriously live in Europe for 2 years and think that you're going to see the same cultural diversity in the US. It's bullshit.
t1_dsqd3qb	0	*	What people are trying to say is the US is more like the EU is size and diversity
t1_dsrqflr	0	*	So it's probably a good idea for Americans to avoid Turkey?
t1_dsqqk6n	1	*	Where in my comment did I say other countries weren't also diverse or that the US was unique? Jesus Christ.
t1_dsqu6v3	0	*	Where would you surf if coming down from the alps? 
t1_dsr8o4j	0	*	So you mean you would not rather discuss Puerto Rico when discussing public utilities?
t1_dsqx4d7	1	*	I wouldn't doubt it was some kind of name screw up in a database or something.  I don't know, that crazy.    I have friends denied from Canada, but he did have misdemeanor convictions.
t1_dsrmhxd	1	*	1. The West isn't just the United States 2. Laws do not necessarily match the values of a country 3. Many Americans don't support penal labor and want to shrink the prison population, myself included.
t1_dsqj7d6	0	*	I suppose it's all a matter of opinion. What's great about Europe is that you have the option to see something completely different with just an hour plane journey.
t1_dsreuv0	0	*	That doesn't make any sense. That's like me saying there's no history in Luxembourg because it was only formed in the 1800's. The castles don't count, because they don't pertain to Luxembourg.
t1_dsrxst3	1	*	Tours !
t1_dsrrrzr	0	*	What supports your claims that Trump is a racist? What youre saying that if one does not seek out and kill racists, youre supporting racism. 
t1_dsr00g7	0	*	Hey! That's funny! Just thought you should know someone appreciated it.
t1_dsre7j4	1	*	I'm mainly referring to pre-civil war history.
t1_dsrlwxp	1	*	When you present yourself as more moral than others you have a duty to be congruent. Otherwise it's seen (justifiably so) as hypocrisy.
t1_dsqx9zr	1	*	But I didn't start it!
t1_dsquvw1	0	*	Babylonians actually do need a passport to travel in Europe 
t1_dsrw9cu	0	*	Gee, the economy is booming, unemployment is down, and new college loan standards are being discussed..... Damn that Trump.
t1_dsq4u49	1	*	Stop, I don't want Deleuze my mind. 
t1_dsrveiy	1	*	all what things? you have ski resorts, beaches and national parks in your back yard?
t1_dsqe8uv	1	*	oh, so you have english as your second native language. unforgivable.
t1_dsqsoxg	1	*	> English might not be everyone's first language.  Exactly. American was my first. 
t1_dsr5x0x	1	*	This totally has been happening more and more over the last year. not every airport, but most of them are doing it
t1_dsrd1pm	1	*	It is hidden in Austria. Those pesky Alps and their secrets.  
t1_dsqewcp	1	*	He must be from Maine
t1_dsqtw9m	0	*	You need to get out more if you seriously think every part of this country is the same

t1_dsqnd30	1	*	Who does?
t1_dsrhdi8	1	*	So basically whenever one of us Scots ever sees some daylight? 
t1_dsql7c2	1	*	This is incorrect. National ID is enough for EEA citizens.
t1_dtky60f	0	*	The one where I know how to read...
t1_dv3lkz3	1	*	Many people would have just slunk away without correcting the mistake.  Have an upvote.
t1_dtcrl9b	1	*	That i agree with, every time I hear about them from the first time i heard about them almost 15 years ago to today has been nothing but bad news.
t1_dur9lmg	0	*	You gotta be a troll, please?
t1_dur9fba	0	*	Inverse is an inaccurate term for this situation. Opposite would be better suited. Still wrong, as that wasn't the opposite.
t1_dv9a6k0	1	*	Can't disagree with that. Generally speaking though, if you make use of the social system in Switzerland, you won't become homeless
t1_dswbm1s	0	*	Ok. Ill entertain this for a minute. What is the chemical composition of the fly ash and where are the clandestine airport locations?
t1_dth3i5k	0	*	> He's a grotesque individual  In your opinion......
t1_dthatyy	1	*	thanks this is useful
t1_duwru0t	1	*	Only if you're taking it because you're in pain. If not you're adding a pleasurable state so would be positive.
t1_dux36fc	1	*	Even if it isn't electric. A bus is more efficient than the amount of cars it would take to carry the same amount of people.  But yeah, electric even more so.
t1_ds38f2n	0	*	Huh, of course I do.
t1_ds35s7c	0	*	Then perhaps its not a good idea to fund hezbollah when you need that money for local infrastructure spending and economic growth.  
t1_ds3s22c	1	*	Thanks for that correction. I get my words mixed up. 
t1_duixfuc	1	*	You want frugal, food courts are out. Hawker centres away from the central area is your best bet. 
t1_dui03ct	1	*	I was there like 4-5 years ago, so maybe that makes a difference   Malls are expensive, because they're so damn ritzy in S'pore
t1_dui9v72	1	*	Yeah probably. The incidents were all from the same outlet. Personally, still a little skeptical. 
t1_duiqvbq	1	*	My chicken rice stall sells chicken rice for $2.30, I was a little annoyed when they raised the price by 10 cents last year. 
t1_duijfu4	0	*	I know.   Pretty sure ignorance is a requirement.
t1_duj51hw	1	*	Yeah imagine a government investing everything into hydrocarbons! Hah!  
t1_duj7siq	0	*	Yeah, and that's a lot better than what you can get in places like Tokyo or NYC. Young people there are living in apartments that are literally just slightly bigger than a single room.
t1_dujcje0	0	*	That's basically just saying that NYC is a bigger city. 
t1_duirobu	0	*	You haven't lived with my mother, I see.
t1_duj032v	0	*	>If  but it doesn't.
t1_dui2f7j	1	*	It's the same everywhere. You can't expect to eat healthy and wholesome while paying $2 for each meal. It might be possible if you prepare your own meals though.
t1_dui4ldi	1	*	Well okay no point in having a conversation with somebody who wants to be an ass. Good day to you sir.
t1_dui8kbw	0	*	but would they still have the same paying job living in the gulf of mexico?
t1_duiwfu4	0	*	And if you live in a poor area that's losing jobs or want to go to a college that's not nearby, you can just fuck yourself and live in eternal poverty like the rest of your family always has.
t1_duixcs0	0	*	Pretty much - the moon is a veiled Islamic element, the stars are a veiled reference to China
t1_dujee4t	0	*	Lmao, no it's because it's hard. If it were easy, it'd be done. And no, many major cities are trying to sustain their shitty public transits. Billions are spent each year on crappy service.
t1_duj28zc	0	*	So San Francisco doesn't have enough money to build good public transport? How much of the USD$470B do they get to keep?
t1_dsr8q76	0	*	I have a bridge to sell to anyone who actually buys that.
t1_dsqzhe0	1	*	That Im aware of, I was talking about over the course of several years.
t1_dv4dnw2	0	*	I didnt imply you were anything.  Simple fact that  if you routinely are associating with racist it might make sense to rethink why that is..  
t1_dtst2sg	0	*	You sound like a sociopath.
t1_dtsntmb	0	*	Seems like you guys are for the wall.
t1_dtsee8q	0	*	Never seen a video, but if it makes your squirm, just think somebody is actually sick enough to do that willingly.  
t1_dtt66xz	0	*	They'll be fine. 
t1_dtsmhuq	1	*	Pretty much. 
t1_dtsowhx	0	*	Zero chance I am going to google that, but please do explain.
t1_dto51eh	0	*	Its really sad actually, I actually had to say the words, Im not a socialist I just dont want people to die on the streets. In a discussion about healthcare the other day. Thats how bad it is. 
t1_dtoil4y	0	*	Lol you do realize Canadian special forces share training with the US. We have a very competent military.
t1_dto6d1u	0	*	I only see ******* what did you write?
t1_dto0nrv	0	*	Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea and I believe they own the zone in the sea outside of it and are assumed to have ships there.
t1_dtnyimq	0	*	Nah we're the cheese burger filled belly.
t1_dto5kyw	0	*	Sometimes the best defense is an overwhelming offense.
t1_dtoblda	0	*	Remember the time America invaded Canada and lost. Then we marched back down and burned down the White House?   Yeah probably not 
t1_dto7ybw	0	*	Or education
t1_dtocirz	1	*	Did you know that changing your mind and being able to admit you are wrong about things isn't being defeated, it actual means you win?
t1_dto9qma	0	*	Toronto was, I agree.  That was my favorite thing about the city, being able to walk a few blocks and see an entirely different community.
t1_dtosrcs	1	*	Because for all Congress has done to increase access to healthcare they've done nothing to reform the major cost drivers and have in fact made them worse. 
t1_dto1l3i	0	*	Yes, but they're pale in comparison.
t1_dtoy48p	1	*	Yeah and not like our military will be able to do much, we mostly just use them for shovel duty during nasty winter storms( Toronto mayor actually did that a few years ago,) 
t1_dto83cf	1	*	They lost their land to the other empires. The British and French empires gained massively in WW1. Russia got that land back not long after too. But ya Hungary is still pissed to this day.
t1_dto6gfo	1	*	Ive seen red dawn. Wolverines!
t1_dto7hwe	1	*	Higher? Try double or more.
t1_dto9ess	1	*	With the way things are going, you may just get your wish...
t1_dtoyyjo	0	*	Is that including the time required for the missile to accelerate?
t1_dtogyxw	0	*	Erm, do you know me? The fact you say that without knowing an ounce of my knowledge just shows how full of shit you are U0001f602
t1_dto6zb6	0	*	Been laughing for several minutes now. 
t1_dto9ply	0	*	Worked pretty fucking well for Finland.

t1_dto9rzf	1	*	Heh   Although I think sea army is the Marines. But I like it.
t1_dto9u82	0	*	Canada hasn't done any serious peacekeeping in a long time, the last time I checked our contribution to UN peacekeeping was a whopping 55 soldiers. 
t1_dtnytxq	1	*	He meant Russia as his buddies
t1_dto92wz	1	*	OH! Right, now I feel kinda silly for not getting it. 
t1_dto9fu5	0	*	We talk a lot of smack about the French but we secretly love them too. 
t1_dtok9wp	0	*	No you didn't. Go look at what you wrote. You're not glorifying defending an ally. You're mentally jerking off to the idea of america's military might. 
t1_dto39mc	1	*	I agree a little
t1_dtny919	1	*	Feeling is mutual. Good day. 
t1_dto9py0	1	*	Thanks American Bro. We love you guys too.
t1_dto7lje	0	*	the wildlife in australia is your natural ally.
t1_dto99a5	1	*	Yea, thanks, I now understand what he meant. 
t1_dtoa9cl	1	*	Learn some history, son. It was *British* soldiers. Not Canadian. [See here.](http://clioscurrent.com/blog/2015/7/13/burningwashington)
t1_dto7ulu	0	*	Who would be Australia's enemies? Legit question?
t1_dto48r0	1	*	Yeah prettymuch, I think that's the point. I mean during the entire cold war we had b52 stratofortresses flying around the globe continuously with nukes, just to make the USSR scared.
t1_dtnzny8	1	*	I think the above poster meant that Russia are his buddies.  Ya know, because stuff and things.
t1_dto9f1r	1	*	So Canada is the fat girl of the continent... 
t1_dto83nv	0	*	if you as a country were less proud of it then your gov wouldn't be able to spend as much on it
t1_dtokhts	0	*	I think that's more reflective of reddit edgelords than being representative of Canada
t1_dtorjsl	0	*	Your point is that the Wehrmacht was much larger but you ignore that also Germany was much larger in population.
t1_dto8qu2	1	*	Should be something to be ashamed of
t1_dtotzaz	1	*	I actually agree with you completely. It seems I was doing my own projection, as I genuinely enjoy greeting neighbors and the like.
t1_dto5pdz	1	*	Even with the US they apparently don't have enough equipment.
t1_dto6kbs	1	*	Yeah well go for one more vacation to Porcupine and Lake of the Clouds because 2020 its coming back to where it belongs. We need that snowmobile tourist money. 
t1_dtoedao	1	*	they always are lol
t1_dto48ps	1	*	who the fuck would betray canadians?
t1_dtoa78n	0	*	You forgot to mention Michel J Fox
t1_dto1p0u	0	*	On second thought, why not do that right now.
t1_dtnytp4	1	*	You misread.  He's calling the Russians his buddies.
t1_dtoj94z	1	*	No, we just have to fund it from our taxes that should have gone to infrastructure, education, healthcare, etc. Again, I do understand what you're saying, but there are in fact negatives to it.
t1_dtokf3p	1	*	Desire what the media says the US system is just not there yet when it comes to icbm defence. 
t1_dtp0nj1	1	*	Skate all day, Molson's all night, at the right hand of the all-father Gordie Howe.
t1_dtokwmb	1	*	Jesus man you'll give me nightmares 
t1_dto98pn	1	*	Is there a WWIII? Is the shipping lanes free for all to use? Are we richer, safer and more prosperous and more peaceful than anytime in human history? 
t1_dtong8z	0	*	Generally speaking, the sign comes after a lawsuit. 
t1_dtonfru	1	*	Reading your comment made me feel all warm and fuzzy. Peace and love, neighbor! <-- spelt the American way as a sign of respect 
t1_dtogisb	0	*	She was a normal cognitive ability woman in her mid 40s.

t1_dtoecnv	1	*	Maple syrup! Skeet skeet god damn
t1_dto2rej	0	*	How very reassuring.
t1_dto9145	1	*	Exactly. Private medical profits are the reason you don't have universal healthcare. Can't do anything that might affect those.
t1_dtog5ha	0	*	Yeah yeah. Arent you a hero.
t1_dto81ur	0	*	Yeah I also know that Steve Buschemi was a firefighter at 9/11, reddit never shuts up about it. You spend so much more than the rest of the world yet endlessly portray yourselves in a positive manner
t1_dto6b6g	0	*	We have both and still zero chill.
t1_dtoqokn	1	*	More than likely he set it down and the muffler caught the grass on fire.  Source: am weed-wacker

t1_dtoel5e	1	*	When they're oddly specific, it was likely a decision made by the lawyers. 
t1_dto67v5	1	*	Umm Humboldt?
t1_dtq1sfs	1	*	My wife saw it when she worked in a nursing home.
t1_dtoaa1a	1	*	Well, as commander-in-chief the president can unilaterally decide not to, it would just be the end of US dealmaking on a world stage though since no one could trust them when they sign an agreement. 
t1_dtof5bf	1	*	There's also the Hundred Days Offensive during World War I that brought about the end to the conflict that everyone seems to forget that we Canadians spearheaded...
t1_dto6tq9	1	*	At any point is wrong.  The passage opens often.  Climate change is making it open more often and for longer.  
t1_dtod180	1	*	No no no, you keep the safety belt on, it's there to prevent the rapes remember? That's why it's a SAFETY belt, it keeps you safe!
t1_dtobync	0	*	Trump could just decide to not intervine. Ultimately it would be his decision to go war or not and I'm guessing he will do whatever Putin wants him to do
t1_dto95ao	0	*	you forgot the first two movies and seven seasons of trailer park boys and jim carrey. 
t1_dtoxi97	0	*	No problem. Just wanted to make the correction cause yours made him seem bloodthirsty rather than including the justification for it.

t1_dto7veb	1	*	Blood brothers?? No here in Canada we make bud brothers.
t1_dtoaanw	0	*	I'm a bit skeptical of him willing to enforce NATO rules in the event of an attack on Canada. He won't even enforce laws passed by his own government. 
t1_dto7sho	1	*	No one would ever invade you guys, it would be suicide if it were drop bear maiting season...and since no one on the outside is sure when that is you have the perfect defense system.

t1_dtyfhdn	0	*	You are either a troll, or a dork. I'm being serious. I don't care what one you are, but you need to take a long hard look at how you think, and make some adjustments.
t1_dspdaiw	0	*	And he is a President, not a dictator, that is why he has no power to do anything drastic.
t1_du8483g	0	*	Move somewhere else?
t1_du8hmdh	1	*	Thats taxed as income anyway though, so its taxed either way, just maybe at a slightly lower rate (this is only really applicable to very small businesses.

t1_duattmf	0	*	Are you referring to me or the USA? Either way youre wrong. 
t1_du83fmd	0	*	It almost always is, because it's a tax that hits different businesses very differently. It's never optimal. How would you structure a revenue tax to not destroy high volume, low margin businesses?

t1_dv2tsla	1	*	Well said and agreed!
t1_dv2qbld	0	*	Not that I agree with the tariff, but wouldnt the US have an easier time than Canada to ship across the continent? So while itd hurt both countries, it would probably hurt Canada more.

t1_dv2hwcn	0	*	Voting results and their outward politics are the fault of the MSM? Wales is full of idiots that voted for Brexit while they got massive amounts of funding from the EU
t1_dv2oajg	1	*	Not even close. Almost all the corruption are myths, debunked conspiracies, and outright lies. The things that are true are trivial and dont look untoward to anyone who knows politics. 
t1_dv2sb13	0	*	Haha Americans are so funny. I think I read somewhere about narcissism disorder and you fit it in a nutshell. 
t1_dv2obkz	0	*	So then should we abolish the senate, which gives every state two representatives? Why should Montana have the same power as much larger populations like California?
t1_dv2tzp4	0	*	And we have geese down here who can go fuck themselves anyway, so it's not like those are exclusive to Canada. 
t1_dv2shwg	0	*	The US actually has more land area than Canada though, so that doesn't compute.

t1_dv2kv3u	0	*	I don't think the consequences will be drastic, it will certainly be a damper on EU-US relations. Whether this is good or bad is up to you, I certainly welcome it. 
t1_dv34ugz	0	*	The electoral college is also the last of 4 concessions to slaveholding states to still be in play. It should have been abolished with the advent of universal suffrage.

t1_dv2si94	1	*	Agreed.

t1_dv2qhu6	1	*	I'm tempted to believe Trump knows he won't win next term so he's sabotaging the economy to put the fault on the next democrat president. But then again, it might be too smart a tactic for him.

t1_dudnrc8	1	*	After the Seven Years War, most of the land was either given to the Province of Quebec or the Spanish (by the French before the war ended), so it's still the same situation for the to-be Americans.

t1_dtuj42r	0	*	Juries are directed not to undertake any private investigations on their own, e.g. looking things up on the internet. If you do so, its likely you would be discharged from the jury.

t1_dtu9t8c	1	*	If you really try, and commit to it, you can be shittier. I can see it in you.
t1_dtw36rj	1	*	Being confronted by police in America is much more frightening because you know how they are prone to overreacting. German police are far from as trigger happy as American police.
t1_dtupj0q	0	*	Beliefs never change despite new facts.  That's why beliefs are often crappy things.

t1_dsivmws	0	*	She was Anwar al-Awlaki's daughter.
t1_dsj2eyg	0	*	I know. I could talk about that particular subject for days. Does this, however, morally legitimate hiding Bin Laden?
t1_dthq12v	1	*	I don't necessarily think so, people overestimate demographic decline of China and the demographic dividend India is supposed to have is not as big of a deal that Indians tend to make it out to be.
t1_dsiz5sh	0	*	In your analogy, the US is the rapist, not the victim. So it really doesn't pan out the way you're thinking. 
t1_dsj0l76	1	*	I'm referencing the old have you stopped beating your wife joke because  the language has a similar implied claim in it, at least when read a certain way.  I say I say, it's a joke son.
t1_dsitztx	0	*	You're still missing the point.   ALL of that considered it's still the most stable period in human history.   Do you just only watch the news?   Read a fucking book.

t1_dsipopu	1	*	That would be a pretty dumb idea 
t1_dsj6zrb	0	*	Both Pakistan and India have nuclear weapons, both countries repeatedly shell and launch small attacks on eachother. If they wanted to go to nuclear war it would have happened at the first incident. 
t1_dsj3vra	0	*	China actually preserves the local languages, customs and traditions of indigenous people unlike India.
t1_dsixbtr	0	*	This is also why there is an opioids epidemic in America... hmmm.. 
t1_dsj7axm	1	*	Yep, totally why 93 WTC never apparently happened and it had nothing to do with East Timor. Okay. 
t1_dsj0npp	1	*	But since both side aquired nuclear weapons the wars stopped. They have had minor border skirmishes but these laat days and are small clashes. 
t1_dsj2clv	0	*	>Your government would be happy to let our troops leave Afghanistan. **Hell, even Iran** would probably be happy to let American troops leave Afghanistan.  Dumbest statement ive read today.
t1_dsj1ub4	1	*	You should too, the country they need to leave borders several other countries.    Maybe the US shouldn't have pissed off the majority of them.
t1_dsj3icc	0	*	For what? To show that a strong naval super power reduces piracy? Or that we currently live in an Era of relative peace? Any history book will show you that.
t1_dv5pjuz	0	*	Only the UK. Pro-EU sentiment has *grown* in France and Germany. 
t1_dv64s89	0	*	The US did pretty well out of those wars before belatedly joining in.   The Russians did more to help defeat the Nazis than they receive credit for. 
t1_dv64xfi	1	*	Good points.
t1_dv6ygl8	1	*	That's the idea yeah haha.  
t1_dv61p55	1	*	I would rather say, european know how with russian Ressources and a direct Land route to China, would be way less favorable to the US then, a Europe that has some Problems with Russia and China.
t1_dv5e9hr	0	*	No, I'm putting the media control and power in a perspective you will understand. If the media says black people shouldn't have rights, is this okay? 
t1_dv5hm6s	0	*	That would be against EU law. If it were possible then it would have happened already. With the Canada deal they didn't actually want to trade with all of the EU, but they had no other choice.
t1_dv5auyl	0	*	Reality hits you hard.
t1_dv5qmjw	0	*	Take a look at the labor market distribution for the above services. White collar living in big cities and thinking the entire workforce can do what they do.
t1_dv54kbo	1	*	You should just say i know nothing about trade at all lol and leave it at that instead of talking about being raped by trade deals
t1_dv5l6qw	1	*	It isn't though. Hilary proposed retraining for those in the coal industry.

t1_duvyxj7	0	*	Yes, and despite that, the USA and Europe managed to emit more. 
t1_duw2xaf	1	*	Exactly. Theyre not doing it because they care about the environment. Theyre acting green because they care about China.

t1_duw2m6o	1	*	Can confirm. Additionally, China does what looks good, not [always] what is good.
t1_duwrmji	1	*	it's called scientific consensus', which carries a lot more weight than a bunch of right-wing deniers sitting in their basements does

t1_duw1yd9	1	*	I know it sounds better at state level, but if you go down to personal level it's bad again. The consumerism and the me, me , me attitude are unhindered.

t1_dux1jec	0	*	Lol pulling out of the paris climate agreement, trying to revive coal and placing a tariff on solar panels. Yep guys fake news nothing to see! Go back to T_D with your bullshit.

t1_duw36sh	1	*	You realize Obama had the help of a democrat house and senate with his victory for two years???
t1_dux37yh	0	*	The point is that they are putting policy in place to one day reduce emissions. We are going the opposite way in undoing these policies and making solar more expensive.
t1_duw8xbs	0	*	No offence, but people said the same thing with Sanders/Hillary amd Hillary/Trump. You guys still got Annoying Orange for president.
t1_dux321t	1	*	Right because of past administrations. Trump is working to undo that. For example, he just introduced a 30% tariff on solar panels.
t1_duw0rml	1	*	Results are more important than intentions for something this serious.
t1_duw1e4t	1	*	I'd agree. I mean, that's basically how it worked with us too but it was back in the '70s and '80s.

t1_duw3ywt	1	*	True
t1_duw41ly	1	*	So right wingers are against led lightbulbs now? 
t1_duw9qu2	1	*	Sure, but it is a common strategy of these industries to fund info campaigns that seek to place burden on the consumers,and then they (businesses) don't address shit.  
t1_duw19uu	1	*	No one cares if its altruistic. That is completely irrelevant.

t1_duwk3qu	0	*	I think it's much more bad for your milk - and yourself, than environment.
t1_duwi4bk	0	*	If you click on the link you'll see the total amount of emissions which of course, accumulate on the atmosphere.
t1_duvydiu	0	*	The idea is just not to be wasteful. Massive polluters are the  biggest problems but when the masses waste resources it certainly doesn't help.
t1_duwdczl	1	*	It doesn't need to be altruistic. There motives don't matter. As long as emission drop across the board they are moving in the right direction.
t1_duw1uiy	1	*	Hey, emissions/GDP is only way to make certain countries not look horrible!
t1_duw09ak	1	*	Consumer's electric here in Michigan is just starting to switch from coal to natural gas, which CA did 10 years ago

t1_ds21h0k	0	*	Yes, it would be a complete stretch, more like a made up lie.  Right leaning = fascist? What a joke.
t1_ds5qdm5	1	*	Yeah, not the same thing. Supporting a cruel, vicious regime but going against another so-called cruel regime?  No, not the same thing as saving lives by donating blood. Not at all. Wow!

t1_dtl88na	0	*	And many people in the West don't realize that many of these Black farmworkers bravely defended the White farm owners. There were many Black soldiers among the Selous Scouts of Rhodesia.
t1_dtlx734	0	*	Whites are still the overwhelming majority of farmers (73% of farms are owned by whites.) So they are actually *under*represented here.  
t1_dtqtpn7	1	*	Interesting! Would really like to learn more about your country, hopefully visit someday. I'm from Sweden!  
t1_dtkuvrv	1	*	Ya, people say the same thing about me supporting trump. Then i tell them i have two BASED black friends!1!1!!1 HAHAHAAH rekt! 12 btw. I've been told im pretty mitchure for my age though ;)  
t1_dtkqo4p	1	*	Given you mentioned me, I want to clarify that I don't share his views that Jews were damaging to Germany. I find that a rather repugnant attitude based on ugly and untrue stereotypes. 
t1_dtl1cnd	1	*	>Why isn't it bigger news that it's basically state sponsored open season against whites in Zimbabwe?  Sounds like it's about the news to me.  
t1_dtlutyr	1	*	I remember reading that they eventually kicked black farm owners off their land eventually, too, after they ran out of white ones to steal from.
t1_dtm0qsd	0	*	Dogs are pretty good at reading their human's expressions and body language. They aren't classiest, they're just trying to be good bois.
t1_dtl33zr	0	*	I didnt say white people lol. I said white imperialists.  If you want to call all white people imperialists, you are the racist. Or you are just a useless fuck that lies about your ability to read.
t1_dtu78vt	1	*	Highly publicized? How so.   I'm sorry. saying something like it was highly publicized doesn't make it true, you can't expect anyone to believe that nonsense.  It's simply not true.

t1_dt2j6sc	0	*	To be honest I thought that painting from the other day was pretty good, too.
t1_dt2n7kb	0	*	Believing the biblical creation story means taking it literally. Saying that the story is an allegory is literally saying that it isn't literally true.

t1_dt2j3t4	1	*	There were no clues as to his nationality, you just assumed he was American
t1_dt65i4o	1	*	He just wants to argue without entertaining facts. Just ignore him.

t1_dt2n989	0	*	That sounds reasonable, though I think you switched around the times as 10^-43 is the first of those.
t1_dt2plv8	1	*	But it's a nonsensical conjecture. Basically you are saying they God does nothing directly but is responsible for everything indirectly without providing any evidence for this claim. 
t1_dt2iruw	0	*	Which is not what the Poll asked, right?
t1_dt2m1bl	0	*	There are actual reasons people dislike the US. I'm sure some people are just being edgy, but saying that *all* critics of the US are just doing it to be edgy is disingenuous at best.
t1_dt2m3k9	0	*	You think people are so undecided as to give two completely different answers on the same question on the same test? U sure bout that?
t1_dt38f3s	1	*	Just because we don't know the answer to something doesn't mean it's explained by a god any better than a supernatural potted plant.

t1_dt2jm0k	0	*	He started with a full on Wilhelm/German type mustache, but trimmed down to his iconic Chaplin/Tramp so he could wear gas masks.

t1_dt2svp2	0	*	>  don't want to have to deal with a bunch of people butting in to shove their beliefs down my throat  Do you see the irony here?

t1_dt2jj1l	0	*	What do they say about assumptions? It makes an ASS out of You. 
t1_dt2meq6	0	*	it was brilliant.  They named it Iceland so people wouldnt invade.  They named it Greenland so their enemies would go there and freeze to death.  Worked surprisingly well.
t1_dt2lzvr	1	*	Heh, just like that reddit proverb. If you don't know something, instead of asking just make it up. Someone on reddit will come along and correct you with the real answer.
t1_dt2m50q	1	*	Yeah, I was never really going to. There are no YEC claims that aren't basic, old, and thoroughly debunked.

t1_dt2kr4f	0	*	The fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and bad.   Good n bad fruit. 
t1_dt2rc8b	0	*	But has anyone really done it?  I mean, we have the tide pod munchers, so I reckon its pasta bowl.
t1_dt2lant	1	*	Sure.  Isn't god smart enough to know that people will believe metaphors as truth?  Yeah, sure, people are dumb, blah blah.  It's still god lying to stupid people.
t1_dt2m7go	1	*	But his point is that the country's population allows for smaller sample sizes, which makes it easier to cherry-pick, not that Iceland has no historical Christian influence.
t1_dt2iw57	0	*	Like in 2013 when Obama was President?
t1_dt2qznm	0	*	Can you elaborate on the two stories? 
t1_dt43rw1	0	*	Each country in the EU has as much diversity as the entire US.  That's why when you walk around Copenhagen, literally everyone looks exactly the same.
t1_dt2zium	1	*	Great points. My point is trying to get people to question the foundations of their premises. 
t1_dt2jfh9	0	*	Your first post was somewhat agreeable. Then you had to go and cock it up. Nice job mate.
t1_dt3en82	1	*	And he helped progress peace talks with Korea. They specifically said he helped. He's doing great things. Next. 
t1_dt2oztf	0	*	The plain text states that humans are on the Earth a few days after the Earth is made, I'm not sure what needs elaboration.
t1_dt2qijr	0	*	 Amazing. Everything you just said was wrong. 
t1_dt2l3kt	1	*	What do you mean by saying that the story of Adam and Eve is historical?
t1_dt2omiw	1	*	You are absolutely right. I've always argued about the details of religion rather than the message, which is really what's important. Thanks for changing my perspective. :)
t1_dt2qedi	1	*	40 messages per hour
t1_dt2kztm	0	*	Ask her who is running the simulation
t1_dt30h2p	1	*	Agreed. I just hope everyone realizes that Islam, Judaism, and all of Christianity worships the god of Abraham.
t1_dt2tqv7	0	*	Someone could still consider themselves Christian, because they follow Christian traditions, like having a church marriage, baptizing their children, etc. All without actually believing it.
t1_dt2q3vf	0	*	I went to a church school (ie: went to church every damn day) and we called it two Corinthians. What's the big deal?

t1_dt2qx1v	1	*	bArAcK tRuMbAmA
t1_dt2op4w	1	*	There's a lot more evidence than people give credit for. [This comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/134hat_evidence_is_there_of_ancient_egyptian/c71ax4o/) highlights it quite well.
t1_dt2kkvc	1	*	The reply would be something about fake news, failing press, or crooked Hilary. That or he'd just say something completely unrelated

t1_dt2lck2	1	*	Lol, who puts election in quotations? 
t1_dt2mp74	1	*	From I understand its always been that way. But keep in mind people are still people and will disagree. But overall the Catholic Church as a institution has been open to science and evolution.
t1_dt2n9sh	0	*	Next thing he's going to be quoting verses from Second Chainz
t1_dt30rpc	1	*	But we have also cross checked history and the Bible and determined that pretty much none of the events of Exodus happened, or if they did the only documentation and evidence is the old testament.

t1_dt2mh8o	0	*	Where are the quotation marks in Genesis?
t1_dt2pc2p	0	*	There are MANY MANY more Christians outside the US than inside it.   It's a very American thing to forget about the rest of the world.

t1_dt2k2uw	0	*	Why don't people go to rallies with trump tweets?  Trump is like the bible.  He's a living contradiction.

t1_dt2l256	1	*	If Republicans truly controlled the Senate, Dems wouldn't have been able to filibuster.  Look at today's news, the shutdown is already over because Dems caved.
t1_dt2km7e	1	*	He could have been a great flower painter but he took the easy road.
t1_dtnbeuq	1	*	You are contriving meaning from nonsense stories. These stories are common because they are uncreative, and anyone can interpret any story to mean anything.
t1_dt2ikrz	0	*	Of all the things you could have picked, you picked the government shutdown, which mirrors the government shutdown under the Obama administration for the exact same reason
t1_dt2luvi	1	*	How do you make that conclusion? If the belief is that God created everything in the universe, then it logically follows that the scientific mechanisms of the universe were created by God too.

t1_dsdf47j	1	*	I took a drink of water because I have the flu. Gotta stay hydrated. Get your vaccines early and often, kids.
t1_dsd9y1t	1	*	Number of devices generally points to numbers of users. The more users you have, the higher chance of having more people click on things they shouldn't or shouldn't.

t1_dsdhaob	1	*	Overall? Green energy is a huge industry and subsidising is potentially keeping domestic products from even being created. That's jobs, tax money, etc, that domestic consumers aren't enjoying.
t1_dsfid10	1	*	Funny you say that since these are the policies placed on developing countries, who do you think is driving WTO policies?  Back to the original survey, the wiestio

t1_dsb4jc9	0	*	Nope. Atheists are certain religion is false. And quite obnoxious about it. Babies aren't born that way. Babies will believe anything you tell them.

t1_dsavcl1	1	*	Right. I established that in the last comment.

t1_dtr3623	0	*	It's particularly bizarre for people from Romania. They could practice in all of EU, why the hell would someone choose to learn acupuncture in Canada instead?
t1_dtqj2q1	0	*	Because the link says its 52.5% Caucasian and 29.7% East and Southeast Asian?  So at least one of us is misreading something. I'm looking at Tables of Ethniticies (for census metropolitan area)
t1_dtqihzn	0	*	> It is shithole countries like Somalia and Pakistan that should be avoided  ???
t1_dtrlyak	1	*	PhD engineers tend to stay in academics. Most get a bachelors, some masters, and then go into the field. You won't find very many PhDs doing design work or testing (most engineering jobs).
t1_dtr4w4y	1	*	On the topic of education, which is the topic here - Nigerian Americans are the highest educated group.
t1_dtqe2wh	1	*	The numbers check out! lol
t1_dtrto2r	1	*	America allows more legal immigrants than any other country in the world. You wouldn't feel that just by looking at all the headlines from some of the major publications.
t1_dtqoh6l	0	*	Thats extremely irrelevant because there wasnt a refugee crisis in the 80s and 90s in Syria. So presumably close to none. 
t1_dtqexmd	0	*	I don't believe that is the case, no. They are administered independently. I don't even know what an immigration claim is, to be honest. Are we talking immigration appeals? 
t1_dtr6d75	0	*	I agree but it might be better if industry lead it. 
t1_dtqskv2	0	*	Yeah, you actually still didnt explain anything.
t1_dtr6olp	0	*	Why don't you read up on the facts, Said the T_D subscriber unironically.

t1_dtrk1n2	1	*	So without the ban our country would have still not allowed them entry based on our already established rules.
t1_dtrm8ej	1	*	Ah yes, that's probably true. I'm thinking more in the 90s/early 2000s.

t1_dtqzrpn	0	*	Easy there Satan, basic compassion isnt that draining. 
t1_dtrl5ai	1	*	Ya , I know they cut funding to med programs , so there's less spots for residency. Didn't know about your 2nd point but I know some schools like McMaster favour their own students slightly more 
t1_dtr89n1	0	*	You don't think that the number of people trying to immigrate to Canada is also proportionally lower? Per capita measures are standard when comparing countries with drastically different sizes.
t1_dtqyllo	1	*	They took a massive amount of poor Chinese people in the 80s, poor vietnamese boat people, Lebanese refugees and poor east Indians. All of whom have done better than average.
t1_dtqvvem	1	*	Not Syrian, but refugees in general was around 50k per year. 
t1_dtrifqi	0	*	Hrm. I would have thought that if you went to school for such a specialized field, you would be pretty much guaranteed a job on graduation. That really sucks.

t1_dtrltdl	0	*	Do you want immigrants which typically don't get in from the merit system though?

t1_dtrj29n	1	*	Nice
t1_dtqzu41	1	*	See my response to joeydaws. I'm sorry if you're butthurt by my comment but I only speak of the truth from my lived experiences working with recent immigrants.
t1_dtqzw7m	0	*	Out of curiosity, what would you propose as a solution to the immigrants that are there?
t1_dtqxox3	0	*	More than you realize.
t1_dtqganx	0	*	Following your logic, we should prevent people from 'improperly' using the health care system to get tests which prove they do not have a disease.

t1_dt8wm7r	0	*	Sure - what's your point?  Other than confirmation bias, asshole.
t1_dt9zi6g	1	*	I'm upsetting the narrative. I must be shouted down fiercely, because boys don't matter as much.   It's only 1 to 3 %, which is just many thousands a year. Who cares, right?   
t1_du58qjz	1	*	Id take the money and use my position to improve my companys image. 
t1_duhwu9n	1	*	Oh hey neighbor
t1_du4rst4	1	*	No problem!  Hey to me this is new. I never actually knew of the difference until now as I've never thought of deleting my account.
t1_du8espo	0	*	Well it sure isn't a Democracy, and it doesn't really matter what it is, they shouldn't be attempting to influence our elections.  But I guess that's an opinion that isn't shared by most of the right.
t1_duaqlgn	0	*	'viable'
t1_ducr2se	1	*	Woah meta
t1_dtenwqq	0	*	That's always how I've defined murder internally though. And if that isn't the definition of murder, then we should base our system of morallity around what ever that is.
t1_dtejq6i	0	*	I upvoted both of you. This exchange made my train ride in. 
t1_dtenlzz	0	*	Nope, just standing up for what's morally right. I choose not to murder innocent conscious beings.
t1_dteub7u	1	*	Youre doing the animal a service by not letting its death be in vain.
t1_dtf9vgi	0	*	That is irrelevant, vegan believe that non-human animals like pigs, cows and chickens are simply worth *enough* not to be industrially bred, tortured and slaughtered, is that enough?
t1_dtenz2r	0	*	Both are conscious beings. There is no moral difference between murdering a person and murdering an animal.
t1_dtens7x	0	*	Uh, no, I don't eat people. That was the best analogy I could think of. I think my point still stands though, it's hard to say eating people is murder and simultaneously claim that eating meat isn't.

t1_dv4i0zf	0	*	In the same sense that tear gas is a gas, perhaps. Stun grenades are indeed grenades. Set one off next to your baby and tell me how you feel about their classification as grenades.

t1_dsvharx	0	*	One of the hallmarks of socialist brainwashing is deflecting the issue onto others.

t1_dsnsk8d	0	*	So.. most Trump supporters haven't read the Constitution, that doesn't make them stupid for supporting gun ownership. Same can be said about this.

t1_dso1ell	0	*	It is a fairly common tactic in politics to take out loans that come due under your successors term. I.E. the benefits of that tax bill are frontloaded & then expire

t1_dsnvt8h	1	*	Because of Obama 
t1_dso78hh	0	*	You people keep repeating that like it matters. 
t1_dsnwlgr	0	*	Because they still support a Capitalist system with a free market. A strong social security net does not make a country socialist
t1_dsnxnwx	0	*	How is he at least not partially responsible for the growth? 
t1_dso4th2	1	*	Seeing as the Centrists decided to use violence against the leftists but not the Nazis, I think its fair to say Centrists are responsible for the rise of Nazism, yeah?

t1_dsnp2vo	1	*	Well if your view had gotten through when the constitution was made, half the country would have split off and we'd be dealing with the consequences. There is a reason we compromised on this matter.
t1_dsov43c	0	*	Well fuck... Are you a millennial?

t1_dsnqriy	0	*	Because that's not how economies work. 
t1_dsnng3c	1	*	Nah, it is truthful, but the real truth is that the rate of change has undeniably changed. The stock market has done better since Trump was elected that any 14 consecutive months under Obama.
t1_dso1v9s	0	*	He's done the opposite. Get ready for yet another republican recession. 
t1_dsnx7tl	0	*	Then why bring it up. We don't need metrics to show Trump won. He's the president lol
t1_dsnqtug	0	*	You act like tax cut = good thing just because it's a big tax cut. Tax cuts can be good or bad depending on what they cut.

t1_du152ap	0	*	Yeah, he respectably spied on all Americans, wiretapped the opposing presidential campaign, and executed American citizens without a trial. Super respectable.
t1_du18e2d	1	*	Yeah. Gotta remember that even the good guys of WW2 were still racist (just not final solution level racist). Aside from obviously presiding over segregation, FDR also imprisoned Japanese Americans.

t1_dspp7m8	1	*	As an American I would be proud to swiftly disavow teh Cheeto. I would also be simultaneously ashamed that he is president. Something is very broken.
t1_dspre4g	1	*	Yeah, where would the edges of the concrete go of the middle were simply moving up and down.    For the middle of a thing with fixed edges to move up and down, the thing as a whole must bend.

t1_dtmzns3	0	*	If you know about it, then don't you think ISIS knows about it?  * Hey jibab, check out what I put on twitter * himal, I don't see anything * it's right there
t1_dtn4cbl	0	*	What kind of half baked reasoning is this? Of course ideas can be bad. What are you talking about.
t1_dtmy81u	1	*	Relax and maybe I wouldn't know that's a lie... you're not funny.
t1_dtn61f1	0	*	Syria, Ukraine, Burma, ISIS uses it, and some countries still use it as a form of execution.
t1_dtn0w3o	0	*	Source?   Oh never mind this is Reddit. None of you have any idea what you're talking about. 
t1_dtmzdf2	0	*	And there it is...the strawman when all else fails...
t1_dtn580y	1	*	Ahh the honeypot.
t1_dtmrvoj	0	*	The law tells me I have to wear pants. Is that absurd?
t1_dtn4l50	1	*	No, but intelligence agencies would. 
t1_dtmxe2r	0	*	God is Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ was human.
t1_dtn8291	1	*	Ignore this guy. He's just trying to defend am archaic, barbaric religion. 
t1_dtnwolr	0	*	Just used your own logic. If you're so offended by it maybe you should rethink your argument.
t1_dtnm63s	0	*	I think socially mandated is an interesting phrase. I think there's an interesting grey area between social acceptance and social oppression.
t1_dtnbjt5	0	*	Seeing as I am an American, and according to Websters Dictionary, its primary definition is to watch over an exam in British English, that makes sense. We call that proctoring here.
t1_dtmzrea	1	*	The troubling times are coming from the Nazi apologists who run over people they don't agree with with their cars but feminists are the REAL problem!!
t1_dtn4ei8	1	*	Yes, on the whole people in Turkey were very friendly and decent
t1_dtp6pzn	0	*	You can take a Hijab off if you don't want. You can't unkill stuff. Please stop making me resolutely defend a covering I think is ugly.
t1_dtmv7au	0	*	It's not a false equivalency. It's just false. Twitter bans the shit out of ISIS accounts for the very same reason it bans conservative accounts - violation of Twitter's TOS.  
t1_dtn4g1j	1	*	Never will be a symbol of female empowerment. It would be just relegated to the history books and left behind. 
t1_dtnlvja	0	*	Well said, very well said.
t1_dtn0qae	0	*	Yet women aren't forced to wear anything specific in Israel, despite the Torah saying so.
t1_dtmnde6	1	*	Fair enough.
t1_dtn7j7y	0	*	You are, at least, two hundred percent correct. USA, totally where shit is better than UK cuntage. 
t1_dtnv6pa	1	*	Well we're not a monarchy and we don't have a state-endorsed religion...
t1_dtn49an	1	*	Oh, I don't know, maybe it's a non thing. I'm sorry. I'm probably drunk. I doubt that the idea of a God even effects the daily ins and outs of laws. It certainty doesn't affect me. :)
t1_dtn9dra	0	*	Yes because Hijab is an Arabic word. It means something different to Iranians. You are being pedantic. 
t1_dtn20fl	0	*	I think it was a case of Ahhh, tourists!  Ka-ching! and with the scarf on they were confused, Americans don't wear head scarfs.  One guy thought I was German and started speaking German to me.  lol
t1_dtmqdaa	0	*	No, they have immunity.
t1_dtnmtoq	1	*	It definitely is if it is in all caps. 
t1_dtn0ytc	1	*	Oh sorry for misunderstanding you.
t1_dtmxob8	1	*	Yay! ufe0f
t1_dtmyrgk	0	*	What a great argument in the 'free speech' debate..   IE Where should the line be?
t1_dtnjl9j	0	*	> The base logic of your argument is that social media exists to catch terrorists though.   No one has said that. You are misinterpreting the argument.
t1_dtmzfgy	1	*	Having the choice to do so is the empowerment /s
t1_dtnaee0	0	*	No one should be allowed refuse service to people based on their sexuality because thats discrimination.
t1_dtnbv3g	1	*	Damn... definitely wasn't expecting California to be listed. Thanks for the reply.
t1_dtmxgtk	1	*	Yeah. Its a fucking cake. Just bake it so they can take pictures then eat it. 
t1_ds10m1a	1	*	These jokes won't fly.
t1_dt406gd	0	*	Why would you be sarcastic about a murder???????
t1_ds57gxc	0	*	http://tax.findlaw.com/federal-taxes/the-property-ad-valorem-tax.html  too bad.
t1_ds92tf4	1	*	Well they're wrong  Problem fixed
t1_ds92obw	1	*	They have that right as long as it doesn't violate peoples rights.  An it's not arbitrary the employee has to be reasonable too
t1_du1mvgt	0	*	>none of those brands are sold in the States  Lol. You speak on behalf of the USA and EU at the same time? 
t1_du34mhr	0	*	And what about in case of peace? What if Russia decided to close the straits that they controlled?
t1_du1ujey	0	*	Oh did it? I must've missed that.   It's not ludicrous. Israel will find it greatly difficult to take any sides in almost any conflict in the Middle East, considering no side views it positively. 
t1_du2j10r	0	*	I sure hope so.
t1_du1nw8u	0	*	russia just shared information about released ISIS terorrist by ypg. both of them are terrorists
t1_dsv8jjo	0	*	How's that ACA repeal or wall going? Who knew healthcare was so complicated!
t1_dtr5olv	0	*	Yeah, could you imagine if the entire island was named a angelicised version of Britannia, could be something crazy like Great Britain.
t1_dtrjort	0	*	What about Alexander seeding Alexandrias all arount the places he conquered? He seemed to be okay with the concept.
t1_dtqnmq1	1	*	Crimea is a better example, imo. Closer and more similar situation (although very different). 
t1_dv83unb	1	*	So you don't get upset against the one that makes the false claim but you get upset against the one being threatened by that claim, because it is too trivial for you. I see your logic
t1_dtrjwqo	0	*	>renaming itself Upper Macedonia.  Better Macedonia. Just for lulz
t1_dtrn23r	1	*	What if you own a bakery and then some guy opens one with the same name across the street? 
t1_dtqx2zm	0	*	Well why dont we just change the name of Greece to Dickville, I mean being defensive about a name is absurd right? 
t1_dsoeftt	1	*	Agreed 100%, I am no fan of these far lefties at but the far right scares the shit out of me 10 times more. No need to differentiate between left/right populism, though, it's all dangerous.
t1_dsorb60	0	*	We would love to. Gets tiring to hear how shitty the US is while we provide defense for those countries. 
t1_dsorrh7	0	*	That is true, but it would leave large parts of the world underprotected. Which means someone else would have to pick up the slack.
t1_dsofd1i	0	*	I mean...we didn't really though....we handed it over rather easily...you admit this yourself...
t1_dspf74j	1	*	I thought it must be something like that. 
t1_dspef5a	1	*	http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/surveys-reveal-how-we-remember-not-supporting-war-in-iraq-but-at-the-time-we-did-support-it-10300854.html  Ok. Wishful thinking.
t1_dsojg4b	0	*	\*Grabs popcorn to watch the impending pointless cyberwar\*
t1_dsqi0g9	0	*	Apparently like most Americans, literature is a foreign subject. Get an education and you'll fathom it
t1_dunzgrw	0	*	Armed robbery is not petty theft.
t1_duoq7i7	0	*	What year did that happen in?
t1_duo2m59	0	*	It's still part of the US. For an example go look at countries with actual gun control laws.
t1_duo12t9	0	*	Like all the folks who got elected on the NRA's dime
t1_dupjlv0	1	*	I think I'd probably just move my kids to another country that's just not open with its guns like that. Armed guards in school? bye Bye.
t1_duoha1s	0	*	There is a law on the books that there can be no electronic firearms registry. I'm serious. All records of firearms ownership are paper copies only as a result of NRA lobbying. 
t1_dunsp4w	0	*	Yeah, his neighbor who was a relative by marriage bought them and gave them to him. There was no official record of transfer, he just handed them over. 
t1_duoa2sm	0	*	How about requiring a license to own guns similar to a driver's license?
t1_duob7j4	0	*	What demographic do you mean exactly, children in school? Specifically targeting a school for shooting makes it a school shooting literally is what I'm getting at. And its still an act of terrorism
t1_duo922l	1	*	So if not politeness, violence? 
t1_duq72bj	0	*	I mean, that's basically how drugs and human trafficking works, so...
t1_duo1nld	0	*	Yeah and I think people should be free to buy what they want, and people who don't understand the topic (like children and foreign leaders) shoudln't dictate policy.
t1_dunxns1	1	*	What the fuck is virtual signalling? Im saying do ANYTHING rather than nothing. I know I dont have the answers but doing nothing isnt an answer
t1_dunst3r	0	*	And that law did absolutely nothing to stop the shooting. 
t1_dupzeiw	0	*	you should take a chill pill and go back and read because you cannot seem to comprehend what has been said here. good luck catching up.
t1_duny2ns	0	*	No.  The merits of the proposed solution.
t1_duoci8a	0	*	Just, no. Wtf good is my gun doing at the firing range. That's like telling me to keep it unloaded in a safe. May as well not even have them.
t1_dunx7ae	1	*	As I recall, it was 'his' gun.  She bought it for him to use because it calmed him down.
t1_duoaalv	1	*	That is the American mindset in a nutshell. You can only solve problems through guns. It is pathetic. 
t1_duoixxa	0	*	$700?   My rifles are two or three times that value.
t1_duokr52	0	*	I had no idea that the buybacks offered so much money. I figured it was like $100 or so..
t1_duo5d3x	1	*	I think they debated a bit and understood logic.  
t1_duohuha	1	*	The language of the dehumanization is rife throughout the mainstream Right.   And it has the body count to prove its effectiveness.
t1_duog8re	1	*	Is that adjusted for today's dollars?
t1_dunwmf8	0	*	was it a straw man purchase or did the guy just give him guns?
t1_duobfl8	0	*	I think its unfair to dismiss their advocacy as irrational because they've been personally affected by an issue they care about.
t1_dunzs0h	0	*	Yes,  when you framed it your way you're right. 
t1_duoo1xi	1	*	Yes, because my opposition here isn't on moral grounds. Sway elections in foreign countries all you want, but the problem is that we allowed someone to do it to us.
t1_dupthl7	1	*	I really dont know what youre talking about with the stereotypes.  I agree with that sentiment. But we should then go making brash assumptions about why they did do it.
t1_dunz01g	0	*	>ive never thought of shooting at another human being. Nor animal without cause for that matter.  If only everyone were like you, this wouldn't be an issue at all in the USA. 
t1_dupcxf8	1	*	oh, oops
t1_duo7u30	1	*	Triple her college debt
t1_dunt3cu	0	*	At 17, Cruz cant vote in any election but he can use a legally owned firearm to execute 17 people. 
t1_duojryv	1	*	That's called a straw purchase and is already a felony.
t1_duom05l	0	*	This may surprise you, but guns are restricted to being $700 or more.  
t1_duo19my	0	*	But we aren't as armed OR as capable. The thought that an armed uprising could ever occur in the United States WITHOUT the strict support of our armed forces is laughable. 
t1_duphfzl	1	*	You can edit it for them then. :)
t1_dur0dut	1	*	Sure, but the moment they try to do that thieving...that thought goes through their mind...what if they are armed.  It's enough to make some think better of it.
t1_duntle2	1	*	No, it's the ammo for the service rifles that is kept separate. Maybe that's what you're thinking of.
t1_dunpb2p	0	*	Oh, riiiight, so we're going with the our votes don't actually matter conspiracy theory? Ok. Well it's been nice talking to you. 
t1_duo0hdn	0	*	I wasn't aware a set of rules could behave in any manner.  It's politicians you should be critical of.
t1_dup8sjb	1	*	> Same goes for knife crime.  [laughs in mandarin](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/33-dead-130-injured-china-knife-wielding-spree-n41966)
t1_duoa5bb	0	*	Look at Brazil and tell me gun laws are what stop violence.
t1_duol5h4	0	*	  We shouldn't give government more power when they show us they can't properly use the power they have.  They'll eventually end up creating excuses for more.  Reichstag fire kind of shit.
t1_dunxegx	1	*	I had mass shootings in general in mind. 
t1_dunwbm7	1	*	Being shot infringes on your right to life - as does being stabbed or killed in any other way. Doing this is already a crime. No law would make this physically impossible though.
t1_duo1nii	0	*	> you'd think there'd be some database somewhere of this information  We(citizens) don't get to look at the NCIS database.
t1_dupby11	0	*	Well let's walk through that.   First, wouldn't your claims logically lead to the conclusion that you are unique in being the only person in this thread to have read the comments? 
t1_duoiejq	1	*	Private gun sales in Illinois require the seller to record the buyers FOID card information.
t1_duoeg3z	0	*	> She Bought, and gave them to him.. she used it as a way to be closer with her son..   Source? 
t1_duodzrp	0	*	ahah you are a nice troll. I like you. 
t1_dup28xy	1	*	Yes, I'll take one of those happening a decade over your 50000 shootings a year.
t1_duoj6rk	0	*	Agreed, but once the ROF claimed him as one of theirs, the media picked up on it without any fact checking and ran it on the bottom of the screen on all their broadcasts.
t1_duo0gbq	0	*	The problem is that you're conflating *the government* with *people*. You don't distrust *the government*, you distrust *people who have shown themselves unworthy of trust*.
t1_duohuqo	1	*	Even that's not enough to amend the Constitution though. 
t1_duo3izm	1	*	Yes and some reports said those guns were modified to fire full auto
t1_duo6gpd	0	*	And if your government goes tyrannical, how will this peoples militia stop stealth bombers, tank squadrons and elite infantry?  Not to mention artillery, drones, spies, navy power etc. 
t1_duo0ozt	0	*	Hows that working out in Chicago? 
t1_dup5rfa	0	*	Yes just like a large pizza with 8 pieces is less fattening than a large pizza with 12 pieces right?
t1_duphsnm	1	*	That is true, but it all so depends on your ideology 
t1_duofcso	0	*	They only wrote the longest lasting constitution in the world.  Meh...whatever.
t1_duocd59	1	*	His well sourced opinion 
t1_duns55k	0	*	How would you implement a law preventing private commerce between two consenting individuals?
t1_duu4ajo	0	*	40% isn't a bigger car or a bigger house...it's being homeless or not.
t1_dtiwm00	0	*	Well he didn't lie, he tried repeatedly to close it and issued an executive order. That's fact. 
t1_dtirf00	0	*	But I'm poppa.
t1_dtibhug	0	*	Because then the prisoners would actually have rights being in America, including right to a trial. 
t1_dtiin8e	0	*	Doesnt he play tenis...?
t1_dticj64	0	*	The refrigerator on AF1 costs $24M. A golf weekend at mar-a-lago costs $3.6M. No way that shuttering a military base costs only $2M.
t1_dtikete	0	*	You didn't not sleep for 14 days. You may have slept very little, but you would literally be the world record holder if you didn't sleep for more than 11 days. 
t1_dtindxh	1	*	Don't forget the force feeding 
t1_dtim8qz	1	*	Ha. Me neither. I apparently share my name with a spanish terrorist, so for a while, tsa would check my back for a large tatoo the terrorist has
t1_dtigpg6	0	*	Typical. 
t1_dtjjr2g	1	*	This is exactly why. To protect Staff and other patients from erratic behavior.
t1_dtifcq0	0	*	Oh, you seem to forget the bribe money to keep the fucking scum that work there quiet about what exactly happened there. 
t1_dtipioe	1	*	I do think its what they deserve, except I think its an unnecessary risk to keep them within our boarders. 
t1_dtih9rj	1	*	And having tortured them for a good ol' long time, all sorts of inconvenient things like 'law suits' and 'war crimes trials' might crop up too. 
t1_dtjhya2	0	*	Remindme! 18 months when he's impeached.
t1_dtiff2z	0	*	Shit that's better than my rent.
t1_dtjc1k1	0	*	Yea... You're an idiot.
t1_dtifeo0	0	*	I would be okay with paying $4-5k/year for that much real estate, especially if the people I am paying don't cash in on it.
t1_dtiv06j	0	*	So if someone tied you up, and made you kneel down on the ground and then executed you - that wouldn't be murder?
t1_dtihfqw	0	*	ppl=drugs :O  
t1_dticixa	0	*	Something we may be glossing over here, but what is it costing to keep it open?
t1_dtis83g	0	*	Sure, but did you notice that it was a black president doing the apoogizing?  Doesn't ths irony of that strike you people(American) people yet?
t1_dtil17w	0	*	Werent you just complaining how US sanctions crippled Cuba? So you simultaneously don't want rich Americans there, yet at the same time blame Americans severing economic ties for crippled them? 
t1_dtiabma	0	*	Hmm ACA? That wall? The Muslim travel ban (the courts havent ruled on it yet before you say anything, and his first two versions failed)? 
t1_dtiibjy	0	*	At least you're one of the chosen ones.
t1_dtkyb30	0	*	The context of my claim is in US.  All citizens and and non citizens are entitled to Due Process under the [fifth amendment](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Due_Process_Clause#Person).
t1_dtihasl	1	*	Well, you offer. You're not paying if they don't take it.
t1_dtqjnyu	0	*	I don't care about your stupid constitution. I'm talking about universal human rights.
t1_dtipm7n	0	*	Presumably because they've been training longer? I can't imagine a random out of shape 50 year old would pick up the sport faster then an out of shape 30 year old...
t1_dtib44j	1	*	I mean, how would you (or anyone, for that matter) know? 
t1_dtijz6j	0	*	Without sleep you won't survive more than 10 days. They saved your life.  edit: I'm wrong, 10-11 days is when you *start* dying, and not *end up* dying.
t1_dtifwrj	1	*	Only the people needed to be moved.  The rest could have rotted -- or Cubans could have been invited in to cart the stuff away at no cost.
t1_dtii4ry	0	*	I understand what you mean, but the president is in the executive branch 
t1_dtigvof	1	*	I may have broken it trying to fix it.
t1_dtj0aof	1	*	I'd missed that, but ... wow.   I mean, I totally get when certain individuals would quite like to be exempt from war crimes laws... but ....
t1_dtii4yq	1	*	You don't really think they spend $15,000 on a hammer, and $20,000 on a toilet seat, do you?
t1_dtiv7v6	1	*	Well argued.
t1_dtibtii	0	*	How exactly does the current system fail to do that?  The number of people who qualify from poorer countries is already amazingly small. How would adding pointless checkboxes help?
t1_dtijydz	0	*	implying destroying the intelligence agencies is bad
t1_dticb2s	1	*	Typical response. Oh its the race card.. They would never just pick people up who they believe know something when in fact they dont and just torture them for no reason. Yeah wed never do that. /s
t1_dtiybq1	0	*	Thanks for the well wishes. That is kind and considerate of you.
t1_dtibgxo	0	*	Cuba has refused to cash any of the checks.
t1_dtil95y	0	*	These same people never consider how delighted Russia is that one party is trying to hamstring a president and cause political unrest in the US. 
t1_dtj9w73	0	*	Still didnt answer the question 
t1_dtitl96	1	*	Well, someone needs to remind the Elasmobranchii subclass that Steve Irwin still has shooters out here. 
t1_dtimo0t	1	*	I know but the regional British inflection is funnier in my head.
t1_dtiyizv	0	*	Heh. That suggests they were actually budgeting legal expenses.
t1_dtikfo3	0	*	Clearly Castro was loved by all, that is why Cubans hop on make shift rafts attempting to cross 90 miles of ocean to escape his government.
t1_dtilfis	1	*	Actually I thought it was a good use of /s.   Without it, people could think you really believe the US is never wrong, no matter whether it is a popular opinion or not. Or maybe Im not getting it...
t1_dtif75x	0	*	> Obama could have closed it and in fact lacked the political will to do it.  No he couldnt have. Do you really lack that much knowledge about our constitution? 
t1_dtimavk	0	*	Really? Cause it sure looks like 1 year ago we had a huge isis problem and now we don't.... So uhh? 
t1_dtijmbr	1	*	Well, he's given you articles and sources while you have in fact not. You're saying that shit without connecting to any source while fucking that guy for giving wrong (?) source.   
t1_dtjg8wk	1	*	Unicorns exist. Prove me wrong. 
t1_dtia5w5	1	*	Just gotta squeeze. a. bit. tighter. 
t1_dtiie09	0	*	Uhhhhhhhh no that's not at all the situation. We've leased that land since 1903. Shit they ratified our ownership in their constitution.
t1_dtil445	0	*	Do you deny that propaganda and brainwashing even exists as a thing?
t1_dtjdgp6	1	*	I'm sure you know exactly what happens. 
t1_dtjvj8g	0	*	/s?
t1_dtidbao	0	*	It costs $1M for each prisoner a year. We spend that on them already. 
t1_dtk12bp	0	*	Why would a liberal think that?
t1_dtiqmuh	0	*	Which state that is a signatory to the Geneva convention were these guys fighting for?
t1_dtj9ml2	0	*	He made about a dozen videos, by age 15, and the marine had body cameras back then?!?! WTF are you making shit up now?
t1_dtilvml	1	*	Upvoted for not doubling down, better than most Republicans =D.  
t1_dtit8mg	1	*	Thanks, turns out the word I was looking for was digit
t1_dtijwhf	0	*	Who says youre getting out? 
t1_dtiioge	0	*	To be fair, if you went without sleep much longer you could have died. In this instance I think there docs did the right thing.
t1_dtilwwe	1	*	Nah, he's all healthy and shit, he even eats the filet-o-fish.
t1_dtifpnk	0	*	They were called enemy combatants till they were not.  https://www.reuters.com/article/us-obama-security-combatant/guantanamo-inmates-no-longer-enemy-combatants-idUSTRE52C59220090314

t1_dtiuqid	1	*	re-read my comment.
t1_dtilg0d	1	*	Welcome to Reddit, where the Republicans did it no matter what! All because they dont like brown people!
t1_dtioxqx	0	*	dont forget the strategic leaks of information...
t1_dtiimjb	0	*	Looks like being able to follow a thread and understand context isnt in your strong suit. Dont hurt yourself falling off your high horse. 
t1_dtig2ja	0	*	because its not a prison its an extraterritorial, extrajudicial, torture facility where people are held without charge, without due process for indefinite periods
t1_dtipqnp	0	*	I refuse to believe that Brownback did anything of use, for anyone, ever. 
t1_dtj96jm	0	*	Except many of them were not caught fighting.
t1_dtixepw	0	*	You hope a stranger on the internet gets tortured but think its unethical to torture murders.
t1_dtigfzq	0	*	You know it's a sovereign state, right? Imagine if the same was said about Poland, because the US has army bases there. 
t1_dtj4phb	0	*	He could have issued an eo to do many things but didn't, as the article shows. Where's your link showing he did everything in his power? You won't find one, because he didn't.
t1_dtitw8p	1	*	But fucking look at him.  Dude doesn't even walk a golf course. 
t1_dtivt1g	0	*	Still looks like some Rugrats shit compared to r/T_D lmao
t1_dtkap4f	0	*	It would help if you people weren't so incompetent, most of what you said was cryptic in the moron kinda way.
t1_dtigj9p	1	*	There is no problem bombing can not solve. It has always worked so well.
t1_dtia92s	1	*	Yup it's a great game they got going. Try to make the government as dysfunctional as possible and use that as their reasoning to cut government funding 
t1_dtil4ah	1	*	They're the same people who believed there was a Trump piss tape so yeah they're a bit gullible.
t1_dtigg7f	1	*	Problem also that the US took a law which prohibits gitmo prisoners to be released in US soil, so they try to dump them in other countries. This takes quite a bit of negotiations = money
t1_dtifu2a	1	*	Idk, how much did the president pay a hooker to keep quiet? Not to mention nobody said what he initially paid stormy to play with little orange
t1_dtikgxr	0	*	I mean, there are lots of innocent people that are tried and convicted, so I wonder what the margin of error would be here?
t1_dtircel	1	*	They're fleeing death. 
t1_dtjs4i0	0	*	I think it's common sense that a random soldier captured in the battlefield is not going to have information like that.  This whole thing sounds like an urban legend.
t1_dtj7kzz	1	*	I'm not going to speculate on the reasons why, but the fact of the matter is that European prisons are hotbeds or Islamic extremism, and radicalization of inmates is well-documented.
t1_dtiyyog	0	*	I mean you as a collectivity. As the American people.   On them individually, I don't know who they voted for and I don't care, since in the end it does not really change anything. 
t1_dtikub9	1	*	Wasn't that before he started naturally releasing. Which means it's probably was more. Don't forget the logistics, and organizing those as well.
t1_dtiorso	1	*	But criminals aren't necessarily bad people.  Lots of good people break unjust laws. 
t1_dtjs3mr	1	*	I mean it's not held by an army the land is held by a lease. That's not an invasion.
t1_dtj8uy6	0	*	Arrest him and give him a trial. If you can't prove wrong doing, then he goes free.
t1_dtif7tb	1	*	It's almost like taunting them.
t1_dtit02s	0	*	Great. So the punishment for being mentally ill is torture
t1_dtigudy	1	*	30 million for you, 30 million for me, 18 million to grease the hands, and 2 million to close it. Boom.
t1_dtih3so	1	*	you keep doing you, man

t1_dtio8cc	1	*	The CIA is Gaston? 
t1_dtic1iq	1	*	I'll do it for 2 and a backhoe.
t1_dtickv8	1	*	Pay to more employees, prisoners, equipment... yeah, it's excessive, but that's governmental shit for ya.
t1_dtj5z4k	1	*	When a party that has the minority of the votes win, in an election where only two parties meaningfully run, that's not democracy.
t1_dtibr6q	0	*	Probably some company would pocket a majority of it for doing whatever it actually takes to close it down.  Just like so many other things our government contracts out.
t1_dtij8bo	1	*	How are you guys still shock about the markup for military contracts? 
t1_dtiinht	1	*	Horribility is a subjective quality. Nothing can be objectively horrible.
t1_dtinmt0	1	*	You mean, you contradict yourself. Russia couldn't have possibly influenced people's votes, but somehow the DNC was able to manipulate people into voting for Clinton during the primaries
t1_dtixxbd	0	*	Fuck, sorry man.
t1_dtiv844	1	*	I'm against the cold blooded taking of someone's life, when you have complete control over them and they're not a threat to you or someone else, because I'm not a psychopath or a hypocrite.   
t1_dtiq8s0	0	*	It's crazy that you still find it acceptable in any way. Equating 2 prisoner confines is crazy?
t1_dtimj7p	1	*	> I can safeguard my beliefs from what other people on the internet think.  You sound like the kind of person who explains the Milgram experiment by saying well they're just stupider than me.
t1_dtigdh1	1	*	I mean under international law the whole Guantanamo Naval Base is illegal, but then again that's the whole reason why the prisoners were put there to begin with. It's a legal blackhole. 
t1_dtiq6ig	0	*	So they can go back to ISIS like some have done already?  We locked up POW's during WW2 without trial.
t1_dtifz5k	1	*	That wouldn't work.
t1_dtijun2	0	*	But then we'd have to deprivatize prisons and actually spend money on them instead of someone making money off prisoners. 
t1_dtiirg0	1	*	Very well put. I'll give you an upvote before the downpour of butthurt downvotes hits your comment.
t1_dtipp7w	0	*	If we would allow them to become citizens, they wouldn't be illegal anymore. Problem solved.  Then they could pay taxes instead of us paying to remove them
t1_dtisktb	0	*	It shows that you're dishonest, since you believe intent to imprison someone who opposes you politically isn't literally 'one step removed' from carrying it out.
t1_dti4vsz	0	*	Then the US government can only blame themselves. Don't be surprised when a innocent person wants revenge for being tortured. 
t1_dtion5e	1	*	Oops, I meant that for a comment below that one
t1_dtigp95	0	*	Yes, but how many people who saw that ad knew that? The vast majority probably just heard a muslim-sounding name which is exactly what was intended.
t1_dtisxqq	0	*	This is like saying there's no meaningful distinction between someone throwing a bucket of water on a fire vs throwing a bucket of gas on a fire because hey, the house is still on fire.
t1_dtiihr5	1	*	80 million dollars is nothing. Every execution done by the state of California costs >$300 million. 
t1_dt7f28e	0	*	You can also take that and twist it the other way. I smoke pot. After I want a cheeseburger. No one gets harmed. Gateway to food.   Please, see yourself to the door.

t1_dv2rm87	1	*	No, clearly those willing to commit mass murder should be heavily monitored. I just find all of this to be very questionable. Im not defending the guy.
t1_dv37rfq	0	*	This wasnt in the US. 
t1_dv3jcyl	0	*	> In most cases, recidivism works.  I don't think that word means what you think it means.

t1_dv40ft0	0	*	Arabs and Persians are not white lmao
t1_dv2qz17	0	*	The only tools I noted in the article were a hammer and knife. These are fairly common items, no? Is there a more detailed report on his preparations and supplies?

t1_ds2475t	0	*	no im a sphincter 
t1_ds2tjrr	1	*	Don't really have a lot of choices, few anti-pot or neutral-pot sites go beyond the usual SMOKING WILL MAKE YA SKIN FALL OFF! repeated ad nauseum.
t1_ds25cxd	1	*	Yes, thats why THC stays in your system so much longer than other drugs. 
t1_ds28n9x	1	*	I bet if someone their eyes open to good practices, they could branch out on their own.  Granted I know nothing, so don't listen to me.
t1_ds29jiu	1	*	what the actual fuck.  
t1_ds24ya9	1	*	Yeah. Iirc Its why skinny people will generally pass a drug test sooner. 
t1_ds2nbgf	1	*	I guess it is. Addictive is an adjective, addicting is a verb? I don't know, Americans like active words, Brits like descriptive words. Or so my experience says.
t1_ds256xx	1	*	Yessir 
t1_ds260gy	1	*	i have heard in MI it is similar.  still med only here but basically better than minimum wage.

t1_ds2fe6r	1	*	You never once paid for drugs!  Edit: not once.
t1_ds2b185	0	*	Yeah everything goes as planned...../s a company cant compete with one guy growing weed in his back yard. Plus growing weed in the US you don't get the standard federal deduction as a business.

t1_ds2936u	0	*	That is the most fucked thing I have ever read concerning laced product. That is grounds for retribution. You can't pull that kind of shit and get away with it. Was it meth heads or something?

t1_dtxgkim	0	*	Would you say that the body of the deceased is considered property of the closest family?  If you find an unidentified body in the woods, do finders keepers apply?

t1_dsxfsmv	0	*	Technology won't prevent human error and on a large timescale these errors will happen.
t1_dse6bd3	0	*	I didn't cherry pick anything. It can be used for either tense, just like I was implying. Affirmative action is often part of an effort to combat current issues. 
t1_dse37st	0	*	Yeah thats why hes going to win. You cant take something that you infer from someones statements and say that is the same as them actually stating it.
t1_ds2dn6l	1	*	> -china was explicitly denied entry to the TPP by request of the US.  Not really.  If you followed the rhetoric around the TPP, China was touted as a possible *future* entrant, just not present.
t1_ds1x3uw	0	*	The [EEC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Community) was established in 1958, the [EEA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Area) was established in 1994.
t1_ds1wajj	0	*	You're joking if you think a bunch of merchant vessels are capable of providing the security that an actual naval fleet can provide.

t1_du6c1kp	0	*	Navalny is barred from running though (since at least Putin considers him threat enough to actually stop him from entering the election) so what should his followers do on Election Day?

t1_du8w2jl	1	*	This is exactly the case, Navalniy accuse Usmanov to be pedophile in this movie. That's why video was removed.

t1_ds8g9rr	0	*	>> Can you wrong a sentient being that doesn't exist?  > absolutely if you end its entire species.  Look at that a few times.  Do you really think a being **that doesn't exist** can be wronged?  
t1_ds8auh4	1	*	A breed of dog is not its own species. A pug can mate with literally any other type of dog. 
t1_ds8p8os	1	*	My Husky keeps me healthy, I can't stand the thought of her being cooped up (we have a decent yard, but it's not enough) so I run her 2+ miles everyday.
t1_ds93m44	0	*	Yeah but no kill shelters have a capacity, and if they're full the next dog goes to a kill shelter. So one way or another you still helped out
t1_ds8i9ax	1	*	Chill and likes to play fetch are great traits.

t1_ds8jhsp	1	*	Humans have often gone through lengths to cull wolf populations and we arent always the most responsible when it comes to spaying and neutering our pets.
t1_ds8sqtt	0	*	Every organism on earth has negative recessive traits. So your way of thinking (things 26th negative recessive genes) would lead to the end of life on the planet.
t1_ds8nqak	1	*	That's a shame, my chihuahua rescue is great. They're really well behaved if you treat them well.
t1_ds8hx9a	1	*	No it is nothing like that.  Dog breeds have been bread for different skills and temperament.   Yes every dog has its own personality but most will fall in a small range according to their breed.

t1_ds8w1re	1	*	Ok, but all you're doing is narrowing the category it is compared against, making it less impressive for it to be called the best.
t1_ds9rnom	1	*	Oh, you poor sweet summer child.
t1_ds8k67d	1	*	I agree with your sentiment, but there are hundreds of thousands of wolves, not just a couple thousand.
t1_ds8nqpg	1	*	Yes
t1_ds8gsx7	1	*	The point is that when you artificially select for X trait, you inadvertently affect many other traits: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiotropy

t1_ds8nr1w	1	*	No problem!

t1_ds8qowd	0	*	Let's sterilize all humans with poor genetics while we're at it. 
t1_ds8f17s	1	*	The key is variance. Sometimes defects can become valuable, such as sickle cell. Which is extremely valuable when living in malaria stricken places and detrimental in every other scenario.
t1_ds8ynf6	0	*	Ive seen Goldens afraid of the water. Being turned into pets has made them into useless piles of hair. 
t1_ds93kgz	1	*	I'm the wrong person to ask, sorry. I don't know how pedigree is attained.
t1_ds8qnnz	1	*	I bought my husky expecting her to be my running and biking partner. Nope. She is the most low energy dog Ive owned. 
t1_ds8o3uk	1	*	or the opposite, with several trillionaires and billions destitute.
t1_ds8q9x2	1	*	Or Alabama still?
t1_ds8hnh1	1	*	Maybe you should ask JonBenet Ramsey about that, and be sure to ask her how it felt getting her hair bleached at age 5. 
t1_ds8drcc	0	*	Apart from fur length and coat color, they have pretty standard apperance and behavior throughout the country. 
t1_ds8i9jv	1	*	You're wrong on this one BTW.  The mockumentary style sitcom exploded after The Office.  
t1_ds8v29a	1	*	More like driving in
t1_ds8i1sj	1	*	Thanks for your expertise on the matter.
t1_ds95ap8	0	*	I think my priorities are different than yours.

t1_ds8m1gq	0	*	You mean a trait that survived in the wild for 70+ years before being discovered in the 80s?   Munchkins have been spotted in the wild since early 1900s
t1_ds8lajt	1	*	I bet you youre wrong.
t1_ds8zwvi	0	*	Well, she will remain a mystery because doggie DNA kits are $70 and we don't need to know that badly.
t1_ds8jfjj	0	*	Right. Dogs are already breeding on their own and there are already so many. So why then do we have people who's job is to breed dogs just because they look a certain way ? 
t1_ds8grmx	0	*	>  I worked as an assistant at vet clinic all through college.  O_O
t1_dsa1zcp	1	*	That is a good suggestion! I'll mention it to my dad.

t1_dsdfubp	1	*	Y'all will probably be fine but I just don't advise travel to Mexico.
t1_ds18h7n	0	*	Ah I see you're as funny as you are clever, there's a pattern here isn't there!  A very sad embarrassing pattern. (For you, in case you didn't understand).
t1_dsty7l3	0	*	>Nearly all your comments are ignorant hyperbolic comments about how America is a shithole and how Israel are the real nazis.  Ah you're just a troll, nevermind.
t1_dtu3307	0	*	 I'm on your side in this argument but, as an American, please understand our propaganda bots are actually Russian. 
t1_dtu0san	0	*	Nope. I was just ignorant to this problem. My bad.
t1_dtubvue	1	*	not sure
t1_dttyqm4	0	*	I think this could be a Canadian thing - don't they (you?) - have issues with the First Nations as far as previous acts of violence? I.e. the spending is a political decision.
t1_dttqxc3	1	*	http://www.cbc.ca/1.3219907  Not routinely recommended, but no medical evidence either way.
t1_dtf42et	0	*	Yes. In fact capitalists have a long history of making it as hard as possible to compete with them.
t1_dutp2h7	1	*	lol. brilliant logic.  Defendant: Your honor, I plead not guilt.  Judge: TBH, that proves you are guilty.
t1_dus21t3	0	*	Yes, and a few things have changed since then.
t1_duruuu2	0	*	What exactly were to trying to say here?
t1_duam014	0	*	Let me guess? Another American with a bone to pick with the UN until you need them.  I'm done discussing this if your going to insult me for asking someone for evidence why they think a certain way.
t1_dufqq0n	1	*	I hoped that you would learn compassion and empathy for those of us who have had different and perhaps, not as lucky, experiences. I couldn't imagine a fellow parent being such a sanctimommy. 
t1_duc6uei	0	*	You have no evidence to voice your opinion as fact.
t1_dudsrm2	1	*	Thanks, it's my dog's name :) 
t1_dud4rwq	1	*	I already have :) it is most likely the way I'll go. Thank you 
t1_dutueq3	0	*	Lol ok thanks x
t1_duuejgx	0	*	I would say that you are wrong, even more ironic when you bring up statistics. You are likely to get more accurate results when counting large numbers unless you assume a bias in miss counts.

t1_duthrtx	0	*	What conspiracy source is this? Lol how about something legitimate.
t1_dt09xf3	1	*	>Israel how been the most powerful country in the world for the last 70 years   By what metric? 
t1_dszyioy	0	*	Trump wants to restrict immigration based on the worst of a given racial group, you support that wholesale, but then you demand that Conservatives have their bullshit hand waved away?

t1_dt09r7x	0	*	Republicans are beholden to their donors.
t1_dt0dfdz	1	*	> My question that with actual quotes and a trickle of evidence why the fuck is trump still president.  Because there is no evidence and you are being fed absurdities and disinfo through the media.
t1_dt0075d	0	*	both sides are the same guys!
t1_dt0uejf	1	*	The Sino Soviet border dispute in 1969 convinced them the Russians were a bigger threat to China than the U.S, so they started moving away from Russia and towards the U.S.
t1_dszjuh5	0	*	Well I'm glad it's working out for you
t1_dt01q40	0	*	> All of America was in bed with Russian oligarch's.  But only one clown so far colluded with the Kremlin and the Russian mafia to win an American election.  
t1_dszy6t3	0	*	I'm not supporting a party that is okay with Russia meddling in our affairs. That's better than every single republican.
t1_dt058os	1	*	Not for US politics...and among us, Jewery. As a Jew myself(that supports Israel), Jews boycotting the state that protects them is, weird to me but I'm a product of the 90's. 
t1_dt0hnpu	1	*	Well that and the fact that abortion was ruled to be legal by the Supreme Court. I guess the ruling could be changed by a future Court.
t1_dszumny	0	*	only by people that are being absurd. kind of proves my point.
t1_dszyzr5	0	*	because in the US separation between church and state only exist on paper

t1_dt01iot	0	*	Its not even a fetus at three days 
t1_dszw8ah	0	*	Did you read the Fusion GPS leaks? They mostly think Trump's running on his father's inheritance and hasn't grossed a dime since the 90s.
t1_dszzl75	0	*	Because it's murder in the eyes of those that see it as wrong. Not really on the same scale of importance as free access to condoms.
t1_dszjiet	1	*	> Fucking MAGA if you ask me.  Why would I ask you about the Minnesota Apple Growers Association?
t1_dt0escx	1	*	Read the timeline.   
t1_dt0772f	0	*	WTF are you even saying. They just passed a tax bill that even THEY acknowledge will add to the deficit. Thats money they dont have. 
t1_dt01apg	1	*	The comfort of the rich depends upon an abundant supply of the poor. - Voltaire
t1_dt0hpeq	0	*	It does now! Haha
t1_dtjh8dd	0	*	Your reaction suggests you have limited experience with these issues, and life in general.  I live somewhere where this is a very real problem, despite decades of intervention. 
t1_dtio6l2	1	*	Empathy is a virtue you do not seem to hold. 
t1_dtje3ri	1	*	Stop seeing it as a contest of whether women or men are the ones on the bottom. The same sexist attitudes make both men and women's lives worse.
t1_dtj1gu4	1	*	I still think I could keep a hummingbird as a pet.
t1_dtiunzl	0	*	Venezuela has a program that is providing 1.5 million homes to those in poverty. https://venezuelanalysis.com/news/12946  Edit: sorry for spam, my Wi-Fi was screwing up
t1_dtli5vz	1	*	Your words: It's not bs, but whatever *I don't need some anonymous assholes on the internet to believe me* to know I did the right thing.  So again, why did you bother saying anything? 
t1_dtji3aj	1	*	wow, is there a gas leak in here? 
t1_dtj0hwa	1	*	Homelessness has a lot more to do with mental health (or lack thereof).  
t1_dtjdzrk	0	*	Fuck me for meaning well then, huh? 
t1_dtjp6k6	1	*	Consequently. Most homeless people don't have a 12mm.  That being said, I'm not against them, but they do look terrible, and I could still sleep there if I needed to.
t1_dtiv06q	0	*	Could you rephrase that in the form of a sentence? 
t1_dtivg4u	0	*	So we should put mattresses on park benches then?
t1_dtivmiq	0	*	You don't live in a major city do you? 
t1_dtiz6wo	0	*	I mean, Im *friends* with a bird person! So I cant be birdist!
t1_dtj16jg	0	*	So they should sleep on the ground?
t1_dtj85a4	1	*	It's very rare.

t1_dtjv483	1	*	You don't have to apologize to dickheads 
t1_dtizbao	0	*	That is patently false, simply calling yourself a Christian does not make you one if you are not actively doing anything to progress and nurture your personal relationship with God.
t1_dtj7ehe	1	*	Wow look at that guy sleeping on a bench, assaulting people, what's his problem.
t1_dtizxik	1	*	Property taxes are about real estate, not things you own  There is a capital gains tax, and a corporate tax.
t1_dtizxmn	1	*	Not sure how it works there, but in the UK single parents and families tend to get priority for shelters and council housing. Most homeless people arent rough sleepers, which are more often men.
t1_dtj9o9g	1	*	I agree with you on all counts.
t1_dtiyuw1	1	*	I have to cleanup after homeless people on a regular basis. They have no qualms about pissing and shitting themselves I can assure you. 
t1_dtjktza	1	*	They aren't getting in *because* we lock our doors, is locking your door hostile? Since when is my property theirs without my consent to share?
t1_dtj2z9d	0	*	Every homeless person does this?
t1_dtj1gyq	1	*	I've never seen anyone stand in front of a bench and piss on it because they want to destroy things, but I've seen plenty of folks piss and shit themselves while sleeping on public benches.

t1_dtixdw7	0	*	Yes. Make those available instead of making benches unavailible.
t1_dtjbcgy	0	*	it's really funny how people like you fall back to this garbage so quickly
t1_dtjbngp	1	*	We should build shelters. But trying to keep them off the benches without creating alternative for them to use is the opposite of helpful.
t1_dtkcmnk	0	*	Ah ignorance is bliss
t1_dtj5p0p	0	*	Billionaires will have no problem paying 
t1_dtiwq21	0	*	Source for those costs?

t1_dtj7ju7	1	*	 * The biggest problem are exclusionary policies    * people get kicked out of shelters  find the connection
t1_dtjdrtp	1	*	I was talking more about discussing homelessness in general than the drug use associated with it, but you're right in that the age of the child will change how you should approach the situation.
t1_dtjjyil	1	*	There are enough shelters for them to go to. Contrary to what seems to be popular belief. 
t1_dtizna1	1	*	It helps if it is a fact
t1_dtj19ry	1	*	Seriously ,that thing looks ugly.
t1_dtjftdk	0	*	the shooters have mostly been on SSRIs, and serotonin is part of the system we use to form hierarchies. i'm sure there's a connection
t1_dtiy687	1	*	A large percentage of mental health issues are simply untreatable. Its the sad truth.
t1_dtjaxn1	1	*	How many homeless people are living in your home exactly?
t1_dtj0tw1	1	*	Did somebody say bird law? 
t1_dtiyigw	1	*	Incontinence. Alcoholism. Myriad mental illness issues I can't pretend to understand.  I've seen a share of this in Vancouver and the Lower Mainland. 
t1_dtiqmeo	1	*	It really isnt.
t1_dtju4m4	1	*	Fair enough
t1_dtiv2vi	0	*	If someone's saying something that an average person wouldn't likely say because it's insane or ridiculous, chances are they're being humorous.
t1_dtjk4ue	0	*	Again, wrong. College educated professional who commutes from the city lives to the town the grew up in to help.   This is getting sad, please consider ending it here.

t1_dtiwblf	0	*	You can read the second sentence... also it's ridiculous to think that the cold somehow makes you racist.
t1_dtjeppz	0	*	Not saying you should give your cash, but you obviously don't get how addiction works if your response is pick yourself up by your bootstraps

t1_dtix2w3	1	*	Gotta tax somethin 
t1_dtiuz72	0	*	No. Is it hard to believe that most of them aren't heartless drug addict thugs?   Even the druggies, that doesn't mean they are bad people automatically
t1_dtk0zel	0	*	This is a kinda disappointing response.  Allow them?
t1_dtj7oma	0	*	No, I don't think that.  Read what I write; stop telling me my views.
t1_dtjdd6f	0	*	Non-zero, but also not particularly significant, either. Nor are they relevant to discussions about helping homeless people who *don't* want to be homeless.
t1_dtjgu3c	1	*	yeah, they should have just decided not to be born poor and without a safety net. I mean what idiot would decide to have drug addicted abusive parents that kick them out at 13?
t1_dtj7bsj	1	*	A business owner could, but letting them stay outside their building will mean less money and less ability to help.
t1_dtixojc	0	*	And then talked about how making prescription drugs cheaper was going to be a priority, making the opioid crisis primed to boom.
t1_dtizfnr	1	*	partnered rehab clinic yet allow drug use?

t1_dtj2wsa	0	*	You say that, but in places where it's been implemented it's been effective
t1_dtj4426	1	*	Read that in a Yorkshire accent
t1_dtiklxz	0	*	is calling a woman a pussy sexist? is calling a man a dick? calling a human, regardless of gender'a bum is sexist

t1_dtjgl3r	0	*	*sigh*   Ok, how about this one:  What do you call a Spanish guy with a rubber toe?   *Roberto*
t1_dtjah6w	1	*	The park was never intended as a fix for a homeless problem.
t1_dtj79qo	1	*	Houses are definitely not a public good.

t1_dtji2g0	0	*	What happens when every business has a not trespassing sign?

t1_dtjcjoq	1	*	It's a choice that you didn't make because you don't have mental inhibitions. Someone with a weakened mind may not be able to see with right choice so clearly.
t1_dtj8sfq	0	*	I don't know, how about we close down all the bars because drunken yuppies do the same fucking shit every goddamned day? 
t1_dtk4goh	1	*	You make a really good point. People can't just do whatever they want especially when it becomes hazardous to everyone else around them. 
t1_dtiydgc	1	*	The real.....slim shady?
t1_dtj7nia	1	*	Mission accomplished!
t1_dtiv4rv	0	*	Sure, I'm sure we've all been attacked by homeless people. Thank God they can't sleep on benches anymore, now we are safe!   The solution isn't to take their benches away.
t1_dtl4rp0	1	*	Ill take that as a compliment. It's riddled with errors, though! 
t1_dtj6j38	0	*	No, it was pretty low-key in terms of the religious aspect. Mostly, they just wanted to help poor kids.
t1_dtj10e5	1	*	I've spent quite a few days walking around, haven't seen too many of them.  It's definitely an interesting thing to figure out. 
t1_dtizwtt	0	*	Congratulations, you managed to suck the fun right out of that joke!  ( I know it doesn't make any sense, that's part of the glory of a Dad Joke)

t1_dtjnwf1	1	*	Mental rehabilitation is part of a good rehabilitation process.
t1_dtj3ka3	1	*	Its erasing their culture just like it did to european culture a thousand years ago. Its about dominance of thought, not spreading morals.
t1_dtj0bzo	1	*	Interesting leap there...from sleeping to shooting up.  I mean, the comment did say they had it easy these days and that we should stop feeding bums, but never once mentioned drugs.
t1_dtj4clo	1	*	I spent 2 days in Seattle a couple months ago and saw my first 2 instances of homeless people peeing in public.  They didn't seem too picky about where it landed.

t1_dtiw541	0	*	Neither does going after just the ones that make them look good. 
t1_dtj5055	1	*	Ignore him, hes just being a dickhead.
t1_dtjd9ag	1	*	Because we should be able to help the impoverished without forcing religion on them. Like if youre already helping them, it would be just as easy to do it without the religious aspect. 
t1_dtjso36	1	*	It was a statement.
t1_dtk5fce	1	*	They tend to bathe in them because there's nowhere else to bathe. I think they should just add one of those push button showers they have on beaches but no.
t1_dtiv74r	1	*	Are they a government? 
t1_dtijnao	0	*	symbolically a dick has more social power than an arse. just coz they at the bottom doesnt make them gay.

t1_dtiwb9r	0	*	Limited internet access though.
t1_dtjcoez	0	*	What are you doing about the homeless problem?  You are obviously doing more than the churches you rally against, so why not inspire us with your philanthropy?
t1_dtj4ty8	1	*	That's a better alternative.

t1_du7kfbm	1	*	I think it was because nobody had even *thought* they needed to outlaw horse fucking.  Although it turns out there are some places where you can now be a literal motherfucking motherfucker. 
t1_du86s6j	1	*	So is it all or true mostly?   Also, it's not even true mostly. A lot of horror stories come from the states that consider themselves advanced.

t1_du7to18	1	*	Americans are dreamers too.
t1_du9brvi	1	*	The free universities are 100% free and recognized as some of the best in the respective countries. Those who are too dumb to get in a public university can pay their way into a private one.

t1_dthmife	0	*	Yes we are. You've decide women are not allowed to wear certain clothing because that clothing offends you. Stop being sexist.

t1_dss584l	1	*	I get what you're saying. I just disagree where the price is going long term. I think it's a bubble. To each his own opinion.

t1_dss54hc	0	*	IIRC it's per couple. 2 Single people can buy more total than they could if they were married 
t1_dsse485	1	*	You can be as rich as the politburo lets you. If you get too uppity or forget the right bribe they just seize your assets and lock you up.
t1_dssdg4y	0	*	That would be true ... unless people are still not buying coins once again. Which would just slowly but surely kill the minecoin industry.
t1_dstfygz	1	*	Really? All banks, media, and land is owned by the government, just to name a few things pertaining to property.
t1_dss9221	0	*	Also Sydney 
t1_dst2td6	0	*	not that different from buying it from a nerd who played pubg 18 hours a day
t1_dss0ktp	1	*	Less so, actually, as the number of miners goes up the global efficiency of the whole network goes down.  More miners means more confirmations, meaning more busy work being done

t1_dst2z16	0	*	Thanks. All this is very helpful!
t1_dsrtfkb	1	*	I don't think so. It's just the umbrella term that people get into crypto with and then learn about the others. Eventually ETH will be all over the news instead.

t1_dtnwr4e	0	*	Even if thats true, you have the fringe right of the country versus everyone else. And you stick with the fringe. 
t1_dtnss8k	0	*	Republicans never once brought articles of impeachment against Obama. Democrats did it twice in Trump's first year.   Elections matter, Next time don't run the worst candidate in history.

t1_dtnygzj	0	*	That this entire memo fiasco is politcal theatre and Nunes should be ashamed of himself for attempting to discredit the DOJ and FBI over an application he didnt even read. 
t1_dto3xp8	0	*	> Nunes is accusing the FBI of illegally surveillance on Carter Page.   No he is not, the memo accuses the FBI and the DOJ of lying or misleading the FISA courts to extend surveillance on Carter.

t1_dtox02d	1	*	It was partially corroborated, while other parts (such as the pissing story) havent been. 
t1_dto37yw	1	*	Enlighten those of us who aren't batshit right wing conspiracy theorists, please.
t1_dtp9nj5	1	*	No it's not new. This has been happening since WW2 ended. And again zero evidence has been presented showing Trump's families ties to the russian govt.

t1_dt6tmne	0	*	Argentina had 5 arrested, Peru had 4. Brazil only didn't have more because we pardoned the Military Dictatorship President-Generals.

t1_du6k5xl	0	*	Surprised that's not r/latestagecapitalism's sidebar
t1_du740hk	1	*	We control many of those countries. Weve picked their leaders for the last half century. War = money for these people. Thats why theyre currently engineering wars in Syria and Iran.

t1_du6ke2r	0	*	It controls Gaza's airspace and coastline. Look it up.
t1_du6oi45	1	*	It's not about being in charge, it's about highlighting and preserving. 
t1_du6sibn	0	*	Easy, check the records, you'll find most Israeli people came from some where else, while a fraction belong there with ALL of the Palestinians 
t1_du6mojb	0	*	Ok? That's not the point though. The point is broader than this director's service. The average conscripted soldier is more likely to be a dissenter than the average volunteer soldier, right?
t1_du6srqp	1	*	Like in Gaza?
t1_du6gy55	0	*	It's done in pretty much every country.   A little google search on riot police using rubber bullets showed results from Germany and Switzerland, as well as USA, so maybe not a TON of people. 
t1_du6ibue	0	*	Yeah, that never happens on Reddit.

t1_du6stsf	1	*	Oh, youre one of those. Ignore this troll, people. 
t1_du6l8v7	1	*	If that's the case, I approve. Elsewhere in the world, we're struggling with trying to get actual equality implemented as opposed to just endless female benefits. 
t1_du6pj39	0	*	Also kind sir, what are your sources?
t1_du77ibe	0	*	Are you being intentional obtuse?
t1_du6gsh1	0	*	No, but then when I'm on reddit, I won't go on a tirade about how bad rapists and murderers are while really I'm just disappointed in my daugher's choices, and vis versa. 
t1_du6i9zj	1	*	My dad has one. I'll ask him, but I think he got it as a gift.
t1_du6njwx	0	*	Forgot to mention golan heights conveniently. Theyre just encouraging settlers to do that. Who are all ex military. Under world condemnation.
t1_du77k39	1	*	Yeah, I agree he'd be a great choice. 
t1_du6gj7p	0	*	What? Who said anything about live bullets?   Rubber bullets and tear gas are the norm.  Some police departments may use acoustic devices, tasers, or clubs.
t1_dw9t9lw	1	*	How so?  _and you better include reputable sources.

t1_du6iu6g	1	*	Yes, more than they find you deep, or funny, or interesting. 
t1_du6p7m9	1	*	Ill take that as a yes
t1_du6nkol	0	*	Exactly.  And many of them certainly would not have volunteered to go fight if they had not been forced to.  Many of them were heroes, but simply being there doesn't make them a hero. 
t1_du6k9fs	1	*	Ouch, he knew how to hit nails on heads. 
t1_du6som5	0	*	When rock throwing teenage boys can be shot in the head for throwing rocks at armored jeeps, your definition of terrorist is really fucking shit.
t1_du6kt4y	0	*	You said no democracy or independent territory under apartheid. I refuted that and your response is Israel didnt create Palestine. No shit! 
t1_du6gjc1	1	*	Ah cool, didn't know any of that. Thanks for the info. 
t1_du6ubo2	0	*	>Israeli Embassy gets pissy  FTFY. Although, I suspect you knew the difference but are more concerned with spreading your opinion and biases rather than truth and facts.
t1_du6jnf6	1	*	Its the way Vonnegut entirely sidesteps the black and white so, so many people in society try to squeeze life into, and instead dives into the grey areas
t1_du6sgrq	0	*	when was this written?
t1_du72nem	0	*	How many US congresspeople and senators have dual citizenship with Israel is what I meant - is it enough to be an influential factor?
t1_du7178u	1	*	Well then I guess just let Israel do whatever they want.
t1_du6l9kd	0	*	Fucking weak response.
t1_du937ye	1	*	Wasnt making an argument. The dudes in the pdf were. Read it.
t1_du6iciy	1	*	Yeah but riots are not war. The riot police's goal during riots is not to kill people. It is to stop them from rioting or in the worst case arrest them.

t1_du6hwk9	1	*	it is hate/passive aggressiveness when you use trivial statements in such a suggestive manner. and then you try to defend such while speaking of bias, very sad. 
t1_du6shl8	1	*	Not true, it refers to The West Bank
t1_du72erk	1	*	Well, sounds like my work here is done then!

t1_du7khvk	1	*	Man, that book is so good. When you read Vonnegut, you can feel the genius dripping through the pages.
t1_du6k72j	1	*	How is any of that related to riot control?
t1_du6l8w4	1	*	85% of Palestinians live there, under full palestinian control. They see soldiers only after someone from their village decides to decapitate a baby in his sleep, and the IDF comes to find him, etc.
t1_du7e7n4	1	*	Baruch HaShem it isnt law lol
t1_du6qgi5	1	*	Israel has military outposts in the west bank. That called occupation since the legal authority in Palestine disagrees with there presence 
t1_du6xnmd	0	*	Care to prove your words?

t1_dstsrjr	0	*	Do you respect birthers?  Calling a presidency invalid without evidence is not something sitting politicians should do.

t1_duekuy8	0	*	I could be wrong, but of the 3, Bush jr. was the worst. He raised the debt ceiling over 10 times during his Presidency. 
t1_dueeg75	0	*	Yeah I get that. What I don't get is how a Reagan appointee who's actions during the Bush era that caused a recession (by your very own paper) could be traced back to the Clinton/Liberal era.
t1_dugf0sj	0	*	One small caveat, military cuts would not cover 1.5-2 trillion dollars.  Military spending is only about 16% of the budget.  84% goes to other crap.
t1_duflclw	1	*	Do you have a cite for the 42% figure? It seems awfully large.

t1_ds1egdf	0	*	Er... That's not Islam. That's Hinduism. And that's like saying that just because the USA believes in heaven for the dead means they can't have nukes because they will use them... 
t1_ds1dsvg	1	*	An air corridor into Afghanistan, among other things
t1_ds1hr1k	0	*	Trumps admin has basically destroyed ISIS in under a year. That's a huge win on par with Bin Laden or perhaps even larger since they were an active group.
t1_ds1evsv	1	*	Agreed
t1_ds1eoay	0	*	Afghanistan was a lot more peaceful, compared to the shit hole it is now after the American invasion. Same can be said about Iraq till the Americans decided to bring democracy to Iraq. 
t1_ds1gcuk	1	*	this got weird real fast

t1_ds1ik9f	0	*	What is *cleaning up our mess*? Has that ever even happened?
t1_ds1i2bj	0	*	The decision to actually do it WAS a huge presidential judgement call, and there was only about 50% certainty that the intel was accurate. He deserves credit for making the decision.
t1_ds1n5wd	0	*	Because Iran ruling the region is not a good thing?
t1_ds1fmp1	0	*	Then you don't stop terrorists anymore.
t1_ds1el9b	0	*	No, we should leave immediately as we only make those wounds worse.

t1_ds1r4ys	0	*	> human subjectivity as opposed to dogmatic processes.  What's the difference?
t1_ds1ebtm	0	*	Weird how people get so worked up about terrorists. Even the worst terrorist attack was a walk in the park when you compare it with war. 
t1_ds1qytk	0	*	Do you think a war that's fully orchestrated by Mattis will have very many dead American soldiers? 
t1_ds1gl0c	0	*	The point is, you can collect as much intelligence as you want but nothing happens without the executive branch following through. 
t1_ds1g8m1	0	*	The janitor from scrubs was right all along
t1_ds1upvg	1	*	Curious, what was the size/scope/budget/effectiveness of the taliban before we were fighting them?
t1_ds1ho5w	1	*	Is there any evidence thats the case with Afghan? I mean, we never occupied Syria and still got ISIS in return. 
t1_ds1mkx9	0	*	Not true.  The US didnt ask permission to take out OBL.  The US will do what it needs to, permission or not.   This is the reality of the situation. 
t1_ds1j2yo	0	*	They dont like Jews and Jews are the best
t1_ds1tews	0	*	Except Td doesnt spout that so it makes your argument mute and ignorant. Nor does trump. So you cycling these talking points makes you sound closeted. 
t1_ds1gmtd	0	*	Navy seals give executive orders?
t1_ds1ljrq	1	*	I think they're more of referring to what the result of invading Pakistan would be.
t1_ds1g9ir	0	*	Yes.   And pakistan understands the idea of MAD,   If they nuke someone, thats the end of their country. No leader would give up their throne like that
t1_ds1ecgz	0	*	Reincarnatipn? Isnt Pakistan majority Muslim?
t1_ds1l8am	0	*	You think Pakistan wasnt harboring them in the first damn place?
t1_ds1ek95	0	*	Could you elaborate on the notoriously unreliable part? Interested to hear what the global perception is of India.
t1_ds1oq1x	0	*	I can perhaps see him pulling out of the invasions for all the wrong reasons, I can't see him putting the money saved towards anything but making the rich even richer.
t1_ds1n9br	1	*	Saudi Arabia's been making progress, though, and hopefully by the next decade we'll be able to fully kick extremism out of the Arabian Peninsula.
t1_ds1haa9	0	*	How can Pakistan not allow the US to have bases on Afghanistan soil?
t1_ds1guz0	1	*	Your article literally says the seal team 6 operators that died aren't the same as the ones who carried the raid 
t1_ds1e5qe	0	*	Their software development yes, but I thought their government was pretty stable and pro-human rights.
t1_ds1ezac	0	*	Sshhh! Nobody likes to talk about that. Let alone think about it. 
t1_ds1pw5y	0	*	So was the USSR's.
t1_ds1iegj	0	*	No, the nukes, the himalayas, a more professional army than Iraq and millions more people to train and throw at the invading army to wage a war of attrition makes it more legitimate.
t1_ds1jn9m	1	*	No shit dude. Thats the point. Stop supporting the bullshit. Its a waste of money, does more harm than good, and makes us look stupid or ignorant more than it builds diplomacy.
t1_ds1fort	1	*	I mean, he's a worthless sack of shit but whatever floats your support-the-party-despite-the-cost-to-the-country boat.
t1_ds1fcb5	0	*	By this logic you might as well conquer the country completely.
t1_ds1erlu	0	*	Yeah, you would think with the trade, strong academic and economic interaction, overlapping geopolitical and regional goals we'd be a lot closer to India than we are.
t1_ds1gjyo	0	*	well known I'll reserve my judgement till I see your sources. Thanks
t1_ds1g03l	0	*	Do you need more tin for your hat?
t1_ds1hjkd	1	*	The money goes towards the defense of nation itching to be overrun. That is not symbolic. 
t1_ds1lrvq	1	*	How? Who has he let go that was causing corruption?
t1_ds1muuy	0	*	I have huge difficulties believing the US led a costly war and invaded a country for heroin/opium while waging a war on drugs in its homeland. Seems completely absurd. 
t1_ds1la3u	1	*	That's hilarious. I hate Trump as much as anyone else, but anyone who can have their day ruined by spoiling their white male pseudoscience power fantasy almost deserves to.
t1_ds1f4z2	0	*	How do you know he doesn't have a plan? Does he have to lay the whole thing out for us? He lets us know his thoughts on it though 
t1_ds1ehkc	0	*	It really is full of natural resources beyond oil though. http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2010/06/15/article-1286464-0A0A6CD4000005DC-979_634x309.jpg
t1_ds1fu9l	1	*	War is profitable. It keeps Americans scared. He will never pull troops from anywhere. 
t1_ds1hhur	1	*	Then watch this... its even better when you realize his who his audience is and how risky this was...   https://youtu.be/H4ThZcq1oJQ
t1_ds1tkqf	0	*	I think you're ignoring the fact that their hasn't been a foreign terrorist attack on US soil since 2002 so the combination of things we've been doing since then has been working.
t1_ds1ifcl	0	*	You weep for America because you miss how Obama talked out of both sides of his mouth? Seems a little drastic...
t1_ds1gfxm	1	*	Was everything on that PC halal?
t1_ds1lb4g	0	*	thats why they share American technology to China 
t1_ds1jqen	0	*	IN A CAVE.
t1_ds1ysdd	1	*	Upvoted for context and humor, but hopefully along the way to 15 you'll get an English teacher competent enough to teach you the punctuation rules.
t1_ds1fb8z	0	*	So when we talk about influence, the first thing that comes to your mind is bullets?
t1_ds1ei1e	1	*	Who knew geopolitics could be so complicated
t1_ds1g6bw	0	*	I'm not 100% sure, but I thought there were many nuclear warheads simply missing or unaccounted for.
t1_ds9ayfz	0	*	That loss will never be justified. To you we will be sponsors of terror for eternity. To us you will forever be oppressors. So keep your crocodile tears. 
t1_ds1hp7r	0	*	Lmao your a asshole
t1_ds1epzn	0	*	Peace in Afghanistan was never the goal.
t1_ds24m8k	1	*	If they didn't try and be cunts about things maybe they'd be better off today than they were. Tbh the Brits just wanted tea, thats what that whole world domination attempt was. The tea was fire.
t1_ds1yltw	0	*	High IQ, lol, 
t1_ds1gd6o	1	*	Pakistan does provide the US with intelligence and allows US to carry out anti-terrorism strikes in the country. Obama was more accurate, but the sentiment is the same. 
t1_ds1im1d	0	*	>Why is Obama so afraid to be critical?  Pakistan has nukes.
t1_ds1vjzq	1	*	Yup , they will be pissed.
t1_ds2jzai	1	*	...and who controls Arunachal Pradesh?
t1_ds2jrp5	1	*	Then Afghanistan can try claiming it and see what happens.
t1_ds1h2xu	0	*	No one was allowed to make fun of Obama's status as a half white Person Of Colour, so why is it OK to make fun of Mr Trump's tint? 
t1_ds1jf7z	0	*	Id say thats immaculate progress given 1 year. 
t1_ds1dm7v	0	*	They were terrorists that we helped.   Also, by your logic ISIS is not a terrorist group but a large scale rebellion. 
t1_ds1j8av	0	*	It will make a difference for Pakistan. The US/Afghan backed terrorists won't be able to enter Pakistan. 
t1_ds1etyi	1	*	Strategic power from Pakistan. Another barnacle on the hull more like.
t1_ds1oh0e	1	*	It's likely translated from Hindi.
t1_ds1ewfv	0	*	Its cool, well just get them hooked on painkillers again
t1_ds1n7hz	1	*	They have major natural gas deposits also. Wikipedia shows what the army found alone. 
t1_ds1fga6	0	*	Actually draining a swamp, no less.  I won't hold my breath.
t1_ds1f2fr	1	*	And then immediately upped production to the highest it's ever been  They needed funds afterall
t1_ds1ehka	1	*	Thats bc India doesnt like to have best friends. They have friends but just not best friends. Even Russia and Israel arent considered best friends. 
t1_ds1gdwm	1	*	Osamatsu-kun
t1_ds1f90o	1	*	Azad Kashmir, also known as Pakistan Administered Kashmir, is, not surprisingly, a region of Kashmir that is administered by Pakistan.
t1_ds1g2tt	0	*	OOTL. What is Yahoodi Saazish?
t1_ds1qwxc	0	*	Maybe it was an inherently unpeaceful nation that led to decades of war... I mean it *is* basically a bunch of Islamist hill people villages
t1_ds1j3x2	1	*	China is very different from Afghanistan. They actually have a voice on the stage
t1_ds1lhfg	1	*	It was awkward at the beginning. The Indian man asking the questions reminded me of Jeremy Clarkson doing his loaded questions. Except this was about international relations and not just cars.
t1_ds1gr50	0	*	Well when you put it that way and add the pics of Condoleeza Rice, I guess you're right.  Or was that Omar Gaddafi?
t1_ds1hbhm	0	*	We're at war with Kuwait? Wish someone told all of us over here. 
t1_ds1f6gm	0	*	He's the anti everything. He has no strong opinions one way or the other unless it's the opposite of what his enemy thinks or benefits him or his business partners.
t1_ds1ew6r	0	*	Why does it matter? Sincere question.  
t1_ds1fxwl	0	*	> The DoD is the largest employer in the world.  You've maybe heard, of, oh I don't know...China?
t1_ds1fpj5	1	*	Seems to me you are conflating Iraq and Afghanistan, Pakistan and perhaps Syria?  The difference between these countries is fairly large.
t1_ds1usjj	1	*	Kuwait? I think it took us a couple weeks to kick the Republican Guard out of there in '91 and they've been the US' BFF this whole time. 
t1_ds2ailw	1	*	And sponsor terrorism in India 
t1_ds1m9bg	1	*	China
t1_ds1kuyi	1	*	The birth of ISIS
t1_ds1niw9	0	*	It's almost as if the USA shouldn't sacrifice itself to police the world.  It's almost as if all nations should have some skin in the game.
t1_ds1flh6	1	*	I doubt Pakistan has the world's fifth largest economy, though. Population is the most plausible metric, imo. Or maybe largest number of terrorists lol. 
t1_ds2qsvq	0	*	Churchill. Literally hitler.  Thanks for the summary, very interesting how something considered the pinnacle of evil in the west can in it's own right be just a matter of perspective.
t1_ds1h1au	0	*	Why do you think that money is going to be spent domestically? Trump just raised the military budget. He's not going to give money back to you.
t1_ds2swhf	1	*	Why dont you do some research yourself?
t1_ds1hcka	0	*	No, it's what I think *should* happen, if we had a sane and/or democratic system of governance.
t1_ds1f89z	0	*	Was gonna point out and say something along the lines of  do you really want a new isis!? Because this is how you get another Isis.......
t1_ds1g7te	0	*	His words attack Pakistan.  We aren't literally sending troops to Pakistan to assault them.
t1_ds1gpr4	0	*	The difference being that we tried to control what happened there by establishing approved leaders. We need to pull out and stay out as opposed to pretending to pull out.
t1_ds20h9u	0	*	https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1996/05/blowback/376583/
t1_ds1e90g	0	*	They would all die, they're not stupid
t1_ds20y90	1	*	India and Pakistan are famously at odds. The speaker is trying to force Obama in to making a jab at Pakistan.
t1_ds5a84h	0	*	We can only hope.
t1_ds1qx3n	1	*	>bestseller  That's certainly above average.  edit: sorry, wrong link. Gimme a sec.
t1_ds1ga7b	1	*	No, it is not 
t1_ds1uddd	0	*	Banning trans soldiers, for one? 
t1_ds1dj19	0	*	Its a country with multiple factions in the government. The guys we support arent the ones turning on us. If we take away the support, the situation is guaranteed to worsen.
t1_ds1itzh	0	*	And even more for someone who makes more than you. 
t1_ds1gviq	0	*	Link has been posted. I want to watch Obama interviews now
t1_ds1nrd2	0	*	>Except I feel like Trump will actually cut the aid   You're talking out of both sides of your mouth here. 
t1_ds1fbq7	1	*	Phew! Thanks!
t1_ds1r1zu	0	*	> We can't just squat over a country for 15 years pinching out a massive shit into their collective mouths and then say your problem.  Except that we totally can.
t1_ds1gr6u	1	*	Well you see there's this little nation they border called Afghanistan...
t1_ds1elgl	0	*	As long as the area isn't stable enough to have large scale industry, it's not valuable.  The only real reason for America to be there is to prevent another safe haven for terrorist groups.
t1_ds1nryd	0	*	I think it's really nice when these publications put in the effort to digitise their pre-internet archives. That the images can't be included as easily isn't particularly surprising.
t1_ds1f8a5	0	*	Exactly. So cough up the extra $500 million every month to pay for the Russian route instead of the Pakistani route. 
t1_ds1fk0b	0	*	outlawed
t1_ds1eswy	0	*	External Chinese alliances have never been tested like that.  They favor race over flags, who is to say that they do anything?
t1_ds1ql96	0	*	Politifact is one of the biggest perpetrators of this.  Read some of those.  Then read some of the grades for politicians they agree with.
t1_ds1jl73	1	*	The cow was feeling sheepish
t1_ds1ejih	0	*	Reincarnation ought to be a firm deterrent for the nuclear method.  Nukes poison the land and animals for centuries.
t1_ds1hxwn	0	*	Which was basically a symbolic vote to begin with. 
t1_ds1nrbp	0	*	He's a craven. It's fine to say there was no evidence but it's possible and someone who isnt a total coward would.
t1_ds1iagr	0	*	If he did most of the things he campaigned on, minus all the hate-filled shit, hed be great. The problem is he says whatever sounds good then does whatever. 
t1_ds1fc02	1	*	Well leaving means they get to sit and stew to perform more acts of terrorism than they get to now.
t1_ds1eudi	0	*	> . Afghanistan is the new battleground for competing influences of China, Russia, and the US  [It's also the old battleground.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Great_Game) 
t1_ds1fe4q	0	*	Wait, which country are we talking about here? 
t1_ds1jyfk	1	*	Yeah Obama had no choice politically. Who could NOT give the go ahead after the decade long search. I wouldnt give him any more credit than the political opportunist that he was in that situation. 
t1_ds1ecfa	1	*	Set up a Gofundme then.
t1_ds1fhmg	0	*	Yeah, so stupid getting to kill all the people we want with literally zero risk to ourselves. Look at us what a bunch of idiots right?
t1_ds1g7n0	0	*	Im not sure how to overstate the threat of apocalyptic terrorists with nuclear weapons.
t1_ds1k3k8	1	*	Yes, I was wrong, 33bn was since 15 years ago.
t1_ds2upkt	1	*	Hey cmon now.  That's super secret......
t1_ds1ghel	0	*	That *totally* makes personal attacks okay. It's like going to pcmasterrace and being attacked because you posted in xbox, except with a lot more hate.
t1_ds1ecjw	0	*	The problem with you people is you think anything that's not 100% in our favor is a failure. We stop using the carrot, a terrorist nukes a major US city.
t1_ds1dw8s	1	*	Besides the land and air corridor for NATO supplies, its bribing Pakistani politicians to buy influence. 
t1_ds1fija	1	*	You are right! Or Let them eat golf Donny Antoinette. 
t1_ds1hbjs	0	*	How do you know their capabilities?
t1_ds1jemk	0	*	Literally none of that is true. Like.... I'm not sure why someone would just blatantly lie like you did. 
t1_ds1g6x8	1	*	Such as?
t1_ds1e3tq	0	*	It is a big number, that is almost all the budget of my country's military. (Spain)
t1_ds1n4lt	1	*	lol

t1_ds1vis5	1	*	British understatement.
t1_ds1k7k8	0	*	The fact that you claim that as a point of pride is all anyone needs to know the depths of your in knowledge.
t1_ds1me1k	0	*	By Iraq I did not mean culturally.
t1_ds1j5t4	1	*	I think you just mean Russian 
t1_ds1gvcn	0	*	In da ocean deep deep
t1_ds25xos	1	*	*ahem* remember the time Pakistan sent terrorists to India to murder civilians in cold-blood? It's almost as if other countries aren't the problem.
t1_ds1e1er	1	*	Hopefully this can give reason to clean house.
t1_ds75jtq	1	*	But why is Chinatsu's hair purple?
t1_ds1fo3g	0	*	Go watch Frontline: Losing Iraq.  Obama made the withdrawal political rather than based on  milestones of Iraqs self sufficiency.  You can thank him for isis.
t1_ds1l6sc	0	*	Until these rogue groups get their hands on nukes
t1_ds1jdle	0	*	If he had any intention for that hed be spending less on the military this year not more. 
t1_ds1fdzd	0	*	He's showing that he is capable of doing good governance. At least support him where he's right, $$$ are waiting for you. MAGA is certainly on the cards.
t1_ds1edf9	1	*	Oh, this must be the ending to every 40k book since 1998
t1_ds1m03s	0	*	Maybe they don't give them credit because it took 10 years and billions of dollars. 
t1_ds1hj1q	1	*	Yeah, Trump might tweet again. Thatll show em! 
t1_ds1l9c7	1	*	Now that's what I call edge!
t1_ds1gzzy	1	*	And there are FIVE LIGHTS.  
t1_ds2sylr	1	*	Could I get your opinions on both the BBC and The Economist? Because to be honest these are my favorite sources for news.
t1_ds1mmyc	0	*	Its naive to think that the main actors involved in 9/11 no longer have power in the Saudi government. Or that the Saudi government will not continue to sponsor terrorism. 
t1_ds1uqij	0	*	You used the fact that there were people on reddit agreeing that it's a click-bait title as a support for your argument. Punching holes in one of your supporting arguments isn't attacking a strawman. 
t1_ds1m3et	1	*	If he does he's idiotic. 
t1_ds1io1y	1	*	A lot of people did get the president they voted for. Just not the majority of people.
t1_ds1dwt3	0	*	Yes same as with the Saudi royal family.  Except the Saudi royal family seems to be taking actions to clean house.  Will Pakistan follow suit?
t1_ds2kt9s	0	*	[Literally the first answer](http://prntscr.com/hv0qs2)
t1_ds1h9sk	1	*	Haven't you heard. Osama Bin Laden was actually a CIA agent and this is all just a deep state plot to cover up their misdeeds (read: Obama's misdeeds) in the middle east.  /s
t1_ds1t99y	0	*	They were the ones providing funding for terrorists, though. One of the princes arrested was the funder for the 9/11 attacks.
t1_ds28t8t	1	*	Exactly. This is a brute force method by Americans. Islam spread exactly the same way yet we still see differentiation in Muslim countries. Cultures evolve independently. 
t1_ds3frs8	0	*	Really got a source on that? Or just more made up stuff.
t1_ds1rzap	1	*	Scoring political points of course. What you thought language was for communication? That is so reactionary of you.
t1_ds20hb4	1	*	Thats how I feel about Alabama.
t1_ds1j133	1	*	Yeah, Im sure the money was the only thing keeping them from giving missiles to al qaeda
t1_ds1hx0y	1	*	So we went from compelling reason to might makes right. As I expected. ;)
t1_ds1ovjt	1	*	No, thats OPs mom 
t1_ds1j0d6	0	*	Here is what you didn't understand, or what you thought was omitted. Donald Trump benefits more from his own policies than most of America.
t1_ds1kg9g	0	*	Um, Dylan Roof?  Edit: before you inanely respond that was just one incident: http://amp.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2015/06/18/white_extremist_murders_killed_at_least_60_in_u_s_since_1995.html
t1_ds1n0md	0	*	Its honestly one of the most blatantly ridiculous things Ive ever seen on reddit.   
t1_ds1iaoi	1	*	The Americans had to fly stealth helicopters in under the cover of night.  If pakistan was actually cooperating to a useful level, they would have arrested the guy.
t1_ds1jqed	0	*	Their fate is awaiting take over or forming a new weak country, I don't see this playing out well for the people there.
t1_ds28ln8	0	*	why do you say the chinese are the enemy ?
t1_ds1en94	1	*	That's a difference, but a practical difference means it will have different *results.*
t1_ds2bch2	0	*	Yes, my comments are whats making geopolitics, terrorism, war, and humanitarian aid complicated... if Id just stop commenting Im sure things will be MUCH simpler.  <sigh>
t1_ds1mjqs	1	*	They are getting close to becoming the global hegemony. 
t1_ds2cxg3	1	*	Him tweeting his bs may make him come across as more transparent, but it really shouldn't. He can still have the same curated tweets as any other President. They'd just be interspersed with his crap.
t1_ds1gkts	1	*	Ha!
t1_ds1kvrw	0	*	What was bush smoking I think is the question you should be asking.  
t1_ds1hcau	1	*	Ill be back to make a summary on events in 1 year. Interested to see what happens in that time.  RemindMe! 1 year
t1_ds1gs2k	1	*	*We don't believe that any of the special operators who were killed were involved in the bin Laden operation, a senior U.S. military official told Fox News.*

t1_ds1fvms	1	*	NO SIR!  All the world is black-and-white.  There are only simple choices.  
t1_ds1op7a	0	*	And how exactly would we benefit from that?
t1_ds1eqay	1	*	So far its been all talk. I am still waiting for the wall. 
t1_ds1um6e	1	*	No don't you see, it has to be based on the moral answer because that's how most 17 year olds think
t1_ds35v2n	1	*	Kashmir is disputed according to the UN. 
t1_ds1ov3w	1	*	Sure, and they have their reasons, the_donald bans for any commentary that isn't adulatory of a buffoon.
t1_ds1j83h	0	*	I figured as much but I thought I'd give them the benefit of the doubt 
t1_ds25072	1	*	chinatsu a shit

t1_ds217tc	0	*	Not everyone! None shall stand in the way of my mighty hungarian empire!
t1_ds1qvp8	1	*	He didnt stick with Ws withdrawal plan.  He got rid of the preconditions and went with a straight timetable.  Bushs plan had milestones to meet prior to drawing troops down.  
t1_ds1u81m	0	*	He has delivered on almost every campaign promise in the first year.
t1_ds1ogrs	1	*	superpower... lol nah
t1_ds25phv	1	*	Yeah cause that works so well, that nothing ever gets smuggled in. 
t1_ds1f4ez	0	*	Between Catholic and Protestant? What the fuck are you thinking?
t1_ds1f53w	1	*	The Insurgency on FATA is still on-going (And one of the places with most drone bombings), you may be confusing with the Insurgency in Balochistan, on southern Pakistan, which has largely died out.

t1_ds1gn80	0	*	What about... nuclear terrorism? Is that a bad thing? or a good thing? your thoughts? 
t1_ds24nm9	1	*	George Washington can and will nuke Catherine the Great, if she steps out of line.
t1_ds1hyso	0	*	The withdrawal plan that Obama stuck to was Iraq telling us to GTFO
t1_ds1euac	1	*	Guns and bombs don't heal wounds.  
t1_ds1jdm7	1	*	We are buying from US too. Apache helicopters, C-130 and P-8 planes. Also our largest military drills are conducted with US. 
t1_ds1mal4	1	*	Pretending most of Pakistan doesnt resemble a backwards 3rd world shithole doesnt make it so mate.   
t1_ds1yhqa	1	*	Yeah. It'll be interesting if he pulls us out right after taking off the limit on military spending. Oh wait...
t1_ds1ghxz	1	*	NANI?!
t1_ds2miwp	0	*	Convince them of what? No to partition, lol? Why the f would the US care about the internal politics of the British Raj?
t1_ds1m1yt	0	*	Also China is the world leader in reverse engineering things and IP theft so I 100% agree they could do it, easily. 
t1_ds1f2gz	0	*	America was involved then. Osama Bin Laden was a contra funded by the Regan administration.  This has been America getting involved for a while
t1_ds1oxnr	1	*	great i guess everyone can stop complaining about obama EOs being repealed and the new tax plan cause they clearly didn't happen
t1_ds1ina2	1	*	This!
t1_ds1ee8o	0	*	They wouldnt be stupid enough to incur the wrath not just of the American military but all the major powers. India is pretty friendly with Russia and decent with the US.

t1_ds1er7x	0	*	We will never in a million years heal those wounds with military presence anyway so what does it matter? That war should have ended a decade+ ago
t1_ds1ndin	0	*	No, it says the aid can't be cut off because we don't give them any
t1_ds2mst9	0	*	Hahaha
t1_ds68hwy	1	*	You've got so much prejudice for people who hold a differing political opinion. I have a passport and I'm well travelled. This is just another one of your petty insults
t1_ds1eqga	0	*	China has its largest embassy in Pakistan. Folks keep forgetting China and Russia wont let things happen without intefering.
t1_ds1m9i3	0	*	If you consider going on socially media attempts then sure he has made a whole shit load of dumb tweets.
t1_ds1l1e8	0	*	Would make a massive difference to our internal security. 
t1_ds1nggs	1	*	>He's pissed they're going against him about Israel.  Really? He's pissed about something he knew was going to happen? (Or at least *should* have known would happen)
t1_ds1f8mq	0	*	You must have gone to an odd school to have a king for an upperclassman...
t1_ds1kyrp	1	*	Yeah, unfortunately there's nothing Trump likes more than kickbacks so we aren't leaving.
t1_ds1f3ri	1	*	Can I just call you a realist and be done with it?
t1_ds1mf25	1	*	Id rather leave the place and reprioritize, utilize the Navy and long arms more than direct military presence. You can still have diplomacy but we dont need to be so visible militarily.
t1_ds1o7so	1	*	> Pakistan has been critical of Trump making Jerusalem the capital of Israel.   Most countries, and all majority muslim countries AFAIK opposed that move. I doubt that is the reason
t1_ds1kjjv	0	*	guess who created the instability in the first place.
t1_ds2mqte	0	*	Just because you're good at being a contrarian doesn't mean his points are invalid, either. If you can't provide any alternate sources then your retort is as good as useless.
t1_ds225nu	0	*	You're making my point. I'm saying that a war on terrorism is not winnable.  Aside: Is it just me? Am I unclear in how I express myself? or is r/worldnews this eager to jump down each others' throats?
t1_ds2qjle	1	*	Y'all brought that on yourselves.  
t1_ds1ekc7	0	*	> Afghanistan is the new battleground for competing influences of China, Russia, and the US  Replace an S with a K and it'll be the Edwardian era all over again.
t1_ds1lj6l	1	*	I think the chances of America putting something in front of its military industry is extremely slim I'm afraid. :/
t1_ds1kwbu	1	*	I doubt he was the one watching or playing these games considering how many children he had himself and constantly had around him. I'm sure they were done for the kids.  
t1_ds1kkqp	0	*	So not obvious, like I said.
t1_ds1oj57	1	*	The point is,no president blinks an eye at Saudi Arabia because oil.The past is relevant to the future.
t1_ds1r99z	0	*	Of that's what you want to keep telling yourself.  But if India and the US haven't bothered out of concerns I would take their opinions over General Armchair here.
t1_ds1euof	1	*	Feel free to send them some money. I'm sure they'll be grateful.
t1_ds1ffjl	1	*	Or they could supply a terrorist cell with a nuke.The panic alone would kill hundreds of thousands.
t1_ds1tzbg	0	*	I guess I was assuming your comment was somehow relevant to the discussion, sorry if that was not the case.
t1_ds1fkgu	0	*	Pakistan, genius.
t1_ds1hw18	1	*	Just call it what it is, the Middle East has a very concrete definition and you have no excuse to confuse the terms in today's age.
t1_ds1gopp	0	*	You mean the same Russians who are aiding Syria?
t1_ds1ollq	0	*	nothing has changed...that's my point....
t1_ds1g9xr	1	*	Also, y'know, India is a democracy.
t1_ds2sz23	1	*	Could I get your opinions on both the BBC and The Economist? Because to be honest these are my favorite sources for news.
t1_ds1no71	1	*	Islamic countires especially are known for bloody succession wars.  Hell the Ottomans basically made it law when a new Sultan was crowned the execution of the other heirs would begin.
t1_ds1kbhn	1	*	No stop its clear that he's retarded and that's the only reason he could do this /s
t1_ds1th2f	1	*	You think the US cares about the power vacuums it leaves?! 
t1_ds1j61i	1	*	Obama had to make the call to violate another country's sovereignty on a military mission to kill people. If you don't think that's a huge deal, you're crazy or at least really naive.
t1_ds1ld45	1	*	>The treaty was for 100 years only, that has passed.   What you want a referendum to extend it or something on our side? That can be done. 
t1_ds24396	1	*	It's called the *WTO*. So really it's already owned by the US.
t1_ds1ecnc	1	*	Hence the invasion. 
t1_ds9opuf	0	*	Look man. hahaha okay bro. Gives you that impression and people you talk to but not everyone gets that impression. You'll realize that some day. 
t1_ds1dy4o	0	*	Blow everything up? Gotcha. 
t1_ds1eo3p	0	*	That's not new. We supplied terrorists with weapons and ammunition and told them to go fight the Russians in the late 80s and early 90s. 
t1_ds2rggw	1	*	Assuming that you're on the left side of the political spectrum, you guys brought it on yourselves by polarizing America literally 50/50.
t1_ds1guv3	0	*	Building a wall almost seems like a good use of money when you consider the amount of money we put into the middle east to get fuck all.
t1_ds1hkyn	1	*	The Sunni Wahhabist radicals in Iraq was always the plan. We want Iraq to be a staging ground to attack Iran, this has always been the plan. 
t1_ds1sgi2	0	*	Sure, bans are handed out unfairly everywhere but /r/T_D is literally a safe-space designed to ensure that the people within are not hurt by the opposing opinions of others. 
t1_ds1m8wn	1	*	Yes. American goods. American arms specifically.
t1_ds1etz2	0	*	Bring the Gurkhas!
t1_ds1vqj2	1	*	Thirteen thousand upvotes? Wtf.
t1_ds1z0f3	0	*	So, their aim was not to free that region of soviet troops yes or no?
t1_ds1hzey	0	*	Romans can't take a holiday. 
t1_ds1eo6g	1	*	ISIS history **is** Iraq
t1_dsdij5f	0	*	My point is, your dismissing his opinion because his leadership was democratically elected. Thats fucking stupid. 
t1_ds1gkuj	0	*	> The Muslims genocidally ruled India for 800 years  South India would like to disagree
t1_ds3c8vb	0	*	Seriously, you're going to pretend that this President doesn't telegraph his intentions more than anyone else has? Well, thanks for the laugh. 
t1_ds1ng3d	0	*	the crown prince is just consolidating his power..
t1_ds1jqb2	1	*	We've been in germany, japan since 1945, and korea since 1950,   
t1_ds1i6lo	1	*	indeed. it's very possible for multiple nations to have the same land, in theory  but it's so wonky with the way we conceptualize a nation that it simply can't be imagined
t1_ds1eyrt	1	*	Why mumbai, can I nominate Delhi? Leave us in peace. 
t1_ds1iebs	1	*	Yeah, that's a much better analysis than my lazy blurb.  When I wrote nationalism, I was referring specifically to our 1st-world concept of it 
t1_ds1zvzr	0	*	That's an interesting point. I know the occupation was 'difficult', but I didn't realize they went as far as genocide. 
t1_dtq0u6o	0	*	Ha apartheid in a country where all citizens have equal rights and opportunities. 
t1_dtqgb7c	0	*	Not for any other country. Two world wars it gave us, years of devastation and genocide.
t1_dtrbyqx	0	*	>eligible to seek asylum  >eligible to seek asylum  >eligible to seek asylum  You must seek asylum in the first safe country you enter. That's the law.
t1_dtq4m7l	0	*	White replacement is a myth
t1_dtqhm5t	1	*	Places where they don't face ethic cleansing and genocide. If they're escaping those then by definition it is a safe country.
t1_dtqndd2	1	*	When did the Nazis conquer the Mashriq and install puppet governments there, like in France? I must have missed that lesson in school.
t1_dtq2ded	0	*	Yeah but what about those oppressive borders? Settlers should be able to go wherever they see fit, no?
t1_dtqezkz	1	*	Do conservatives support the settlements? I think they are largely indifferent. 
t1_dtrhkfa	0	*	What? Scroll up the thread, why the fuck are you commenting if you don't know what were talking about? Fuck off nobody can be that stupid U0001f602U0001f602
t1_dtqh47t	0	*	Except a significant portion still hates Jews, much less than the Christian portion of France.
t1_dtr42nj	1	*	There where far more important things to do.
t1_dtq4tyf	0	*	Oh I didn't realize you were joking, sorry. Now i feel dumb. 
t1_dtqzgsf	0	*	They are only stateless because the Arab countries around them would rather use them to get international pity than to take them in. 
t1_dtqqy3d	1	*	No.
t1_dtqqzo4	0	*	But why do you oppose open borders for Jews but not Muslims?
t1_dtqczzd	1	*	Umm...no. As shown by the many immigrants there that have not killed any Jewish people and do not want to kill all the Jews, your first statement is idiotic. 
t1_dtqgust	1	*	I believe that is the one we should be using regularly, but the media almost exclusively uses U3.
t1_dts8mbp	0	*	But why would I do it? I'm already here. Legally.
t1_dtr126l	0	*	> But ethnostates do not work and never will.  Except for the entire Western World before the dawn of globalist neoliberalism, and the entirety of East Asia, sure.
t1_dtr1ttk	0	*	>implying it has anything to do with race  jej
t1_du0xb19	0	*	Well than you should edit your comment to add the latest updates.
t1_du2zawv	0	*	Poland took German homelands. You don't hear germans crying about it like little bitches.  Wars have consequences. You start a war and lose, you lose land. Sorry. 
t1_du15tct	1	*	Ye, you right. 
t1_du2exsv	0	*	But in that case they would have a responsibility to prevent them from then going on to commit more terrorist acts, correct?
t1_du1gtdo	0	*	Nice slippery slope ;) we all know Israel has Golan to realize their Greater Israel plan
t1_du29ao0	0	*	Some Israelis are just itching for a reason to have another war though, especially when their opponents are so weak.
t1_du14h4m	1	*	Assad is an ally of Iran, but he isn't a puppet. He's an ally of convenience. 
t1_du1565r	0	*	Acre is akko? Lol i live in israel and never knew it was called differently in english  I stand corrected :)
t1_du12afz	1	*	*de-facto, not de-jure
t1_du1e9oq	1	*	.... Assad triggered a civil war by ordering attacks on peaceful   protesters.   Lincoln declared war only after rebels started attacking forts and robbing armories
t1_du18pf6	1	*	You know Jews don't eat pork either right? And that kosher food is perfectly fine for a muslim to eat?
t1_du14nra	0	*	On the contrary, a conversation where everyone's agreeing with everyone is a bad one.
t1_du1maic	0	*	They matter to the extent that they happened, so.. nothing
t1_du10ucj	0	*	You know the gov you trust, its head Benjamin Nitinyahu is facing an indictment over corruption.   
t1_du10ece	0	*	> Oh, wait, I get it, you're ESL.  Oh, I get it! You're using some astrology-level bullshit to defend your position! Hey, lookie there! Another person tagged in RES as someone that should be avoided!

t1_du1e03y	0	*	> The Syrian government was (and still) the worst regime in the world.  this is why refugees are fleeing to north korea 
t1_du0xvf6	1	*	Does the Mexican government officially support them?  Thanks.
t1_du1d0dx	0	*	This is a post by someone who made a stupid statement and now can't find anything to back himself up. A cop out. Lol indeed.
t1_du1o4yb	0	*	A military drone over Israel airspace means retaliation. Sorry. 
t1_du22cn9	1	*	Syria started a war, lost and therefore lost territory. Do you believe Poland stole land from Germany?
t1_du11fvp	0	*	https://syria.liveuamap.com/en/2017/21-september-israel-is-responsible-for-tonights-attack-on http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2017/11/02/Israeli-jets-bomb-Syria-arms-depot-.html 
t1_du1vqyd	1	*	Yeah I thought that was common knowledge
t1_du1mdu0	1	*	Yes that's great reasoning. I agree.
t1_du1ydmb	0	*	Occupied Syria*
t1_du1p37i	0	*	By lost you mean to say was betrayed and backstabbed by
t1_dv2mk6c	1	*	And suggesting Syrias economy is better off with all its cities and infrastructure destroyed because it would mean jobs to rebuild, isnt dumb?
t1_dtpjyae	0	*	TOR does not anonymize you, you still need a VPN.
t1_dtpjfux	0	*	To be fair, I don't really torrent much. I mostly stream stuff these days.
t1_dtpq96u	0	*	You wouldn't download a car
t1_dtpu0b1	1	*	Remember: if something is free, you are the product.
t1_dtpokrt	0	*	Uhh did they edit their post because I don't see what you're quoting, but if so that's hilarious.
t1_dtqvoq5	1	*	I would back a gofund me.  Let me know!
t1_dtpt7sp	0	*	Pretty sure piracy rules stem from corporations protecting their IP, not religious dogma, but ok.  
t1_dtq0o2q	1	*	Thanks, Ill check it out. All of these names are sounding familiar which means they were probably on my investigation list last year when I signed up for this one. 
t1_dtpv352	0	*	I've used PIA for years, they're the best. 
t1_dtq3hfr	1	*	Even then you're under selling it. They have gone through every measure possible to get rid of the bay. It has failed spectacularly every time too. 
t1_dtpqpjw	1	*	Okay, I see the distinction you're making
t1_dtprtiw	1	*	Is now a bad time to mention that it's past, not passed?
t1_dtpr1ub	1	*	Correct,  and no problem.  Have a nice day.  
t1_dtpxmyu	1	*	I love Michael Geist
t1_dtpnrud	0	*	...before the mask called to her again.
t1_dtq6m5h	0	*	Uh-huh, so I guess 100+ million people are no one. Okay? Also, have you ever used MEGA? How is it inconvenient?
t1_dtrya4b	1	*	I am arguing in favor of MEGA for obtaining illegal files. For that purpose it doesn't matter if it ceases to exist tomorrow because right now you can use it for that.
t1_dtpphrt	0	*	How much was the settlement for?
t1_dtq2aft	0	*	Would you risk it tho? the system wants you to go to jail. I would not tempt it.
t1_dtps3kr	1	*	Yes.
t1_dtpu5qg	0	*	art used to be open source
t1_dtpgmiu	1	*	In Kodi, i use Exodus, Covenant, Gurzil, Primewire.
t1_dtppun6	1	*	No, that's the basic package. You have to buy the season pass if you want the most recent internet.
t1_dur0x6g	0	*	Typical left wing response.  Zero logic and zero facts, just lots of mindless insults.  Thanks for proving both me and Trump correct.
t1_dsmyj2s	0	*	I directly replied to your comment and even quoted it.  If you feel stupid that's too fuckin bad.
t1_dsoktjb	0	*	lol you just quoted an 800 year old book to explain peoples reasoning today. Real slam dunk.
t1_dsmt11b	1	*	You and logic are not on friendly terms?
t1_dso8qv7	0	*	It sounds like wild conjecture put together by a reddit detective to me.
t1_dso9742	0	*	Yeah, you turned the tables right on me! Master strategist that you are. That was totally not you deflecting right there, you're just a rational, calm being promoting the free exchange of ideas.
t1_dsn40a5	0	*	So when research goes against your point you just simply refuse to believe and then what? Where are your facts to back up your claims?   This is total fake news mentality.
t1_dsq8lqb	1	*	It's ironic that the feminists keep tripping over themselves to praise Muslims when they theoretically oppose everything Muslims actually believe.
t1_dsq8gjg	0	*	Asking questions is a double standard? Lol okay bud.
t1_dson6kq	1	*	Brainwashed
t1_dsq2nrm	1	*	Ok but it was a hoax
t1_dso7ul5	0	*	LittleAtari is probably not living in the Islamic world though.
t1_dsq79yn	0	*	Asking for evidence is 'bristling'? Okay dude. Don't assume things that you don't know. 
t1_dsn1j5a	0	*	He. Did. Not. Make. A. Clock.  What reasoning do *you* think lay behind his repurposing of an existing clock in this particular manner?
t1_dsnf5s1	0	*	How will banging your head against a wall repeating yourself make what I just said not true exactly? Are you trying to will me out of existence through osmosis? 
t1_dsnnuy5	0	*	Where's the joke? You're previous comment seems pretty basic.  Or are you simply using woosh incorrectly?
t1_dsmzvhe	0	*	I don't care about the history of the 1st amendment or the idea behind it, I simply agree with the quoted sentiment.
t1_dsmngfc	0	*	OK, so perhaps *convicted* is a better choice of words.  Does it change anything? No. Still no evidence of a massive hoax.
t1_dsnqq4f	0	*	I'd rather every guilty man go free than one innocent found guilty.
t1_dsq8k59	0	*	And hoaxes are still less than a percent of hate crimes, which you still lack the balls to admit.  So yes, youre biased trash.
t1_dsqbvvc	0	*	> I would expect police to keep an open mind and not decide who they believe until they finish an investigation.  They didn't?
t1_dsntvv5	0	*	So the hijab is basically a symbol of a higher status?  You can twist anything and turn it into oppression.
t1_dsq7z0s	1	*	This time it was a hoax. https://www.ctvnews.ca/mobile/canada/scissors-attack-on-girl-in-hijab-did-not-happen-police-1.3759910#_gus&_gucid=&_gup=twitter&_gsc=65GdQmk
t1_dspxito	0	*	Of course it matters, your morals are totally skewed.
t1_dspjkzc	0	*	 I have a problem with your shithole country and your shity thoughts. 
t1_dspwid5	0	*	So why did you send me this link in response to my initial post?
t1_dsna8xj	0	*	And a lot of that is because it's all become politicized. An unfortunate pile of the right seems to think women being allowed to say no under any circumstances is somehow offensive.
t1_dsn1hua	0	*	But you were trying to insist that there were only 3 cases in 3 years. So he proved that you were pulling statistics out of your ass.
t1_dsntlaq	0	*	Are you generalizing?
t1_dsqra6p	0	*	Yeah I guess all attacks on Muslims are hoaxes now.  http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/08/minnesota-mosque-bombed-morning-prayers-170805212937086.html  Feel free to tell them that.
t1_dso06gd	0	*	Wearing a hijab isn't illegal. 
t1_dsqawpy	0	*	Why are people offended so easily and don't understand sarcasm/jokes, that we always have to be super clear and explain every little detail. Yeah, it was a joke.
t1_dutsx36	0	*	But if he gives up his nukes, he will be relinquishing his only defense against the thing he wants least. What's to stop the US or anyone else from attacking if they do not fear a nuclear response?
t1_dusua4z	0	*	How do you passively invade someone?
t1_dusvumi	0	*	I'm talking about the coup, what are you?
t1_dut5t7a	0	*	Every single interaction that North Korea has had with any other country in the last year or two? It is far more likely to be as a result of pressure from South Korea.
t1_duukjw4	1	*	Your inferiority complex is palpable. 
t1_dutssfy	0	*	Didn't the current guy in charge just essentially declare himself dictator for life?
t1_duv031j	1	*	I wish I had your confidence in NK's common sense, or even Trump's ability not to start a war.
t1_dutie9y	0	*	You should get married, and make his father pay for the wedding.
t1_dusvtvq	0	*	No you don't, almost all convictions come from plea deals, if they don't get executed in the streets by the police first, that is. 
t1_dut0a60	1	*	Theyve only supposedly had hydrogen bombs, and this is even highly speculated, in 2016, and a successful ICBM late last year.
t1_duthrgz	1	*	> so ironically it might actually bring more peace.  Thats not ironic, thats global military doctrine.
t1_dutafz5	0	*	So you say it's easily verifiable yet can't pin point one non biased source for your claims?
t1_duvckwy	1	*	True. Change is not always good. Jeez, I still remember those MTV specials about that lady...
t1_dusutv8	0	*	That's not how it works. Because of the human rights violations and other crimes, the only things stopping us is the nuclear weapons they have. Nothing else. 
t1_dusxlh2	0	*	guy, you're not educating anyone.
t1_dutf1ko	0	*	it would have taken less time to find it than to write what you wrote. bravo on working hard to not work.
t1_dutughy	0	*	It's almost like there are over 320 million people in the United States with a variety of approaches and opinions re: foreign policy.
t1_dutlzg0	0	*	In other words, you must struggle with reading comprehension.
t1_duwqusl	0	*	Yet they claim control over the country, all without using Nukes.  Only in the most delusional of his wet dreams does Kim control the South.
t1_dutxhj4	1	*	No.
t1_du2wgjm	1	*	[Still isn't implausible.](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/news/air-canada-plane-near-miss-crash-four-aircraft-runway/)  That was a near miss, albeit, but it's still possible in Western countries.
t1_du2wgg4	0	*	So what you are saying is that each day is closer to a catastrophe?
t1_du2vxlv	0	*	Jewish is a race, its also a religion but there is a Jewish race.
t1_du2wcxb	0	*	Remember that one time /u/Byoobsincalifornia said >Well this is the wrong thread to read while I wait to get on my flight. 
t1_du36bxy	0	*	In his defense Russia might have shot him down due to their own incompetence. It's happened before.
t1_du30o2y	1	*	True. Being in a sinking ship kind of freaks me out in that same inevitable death kind of way.
t1_du35ain	0	*	This is why I always take a Joystick for my carry-on.
t1_du4hci9	1	*	Yea thats egregiously bad.  Helos should avoid the flow of fixed wing traffic in both altitude and pattern when able. Like you say, 200ft is not enough vertical sep in this case. 
t1_du2w9m1	0	*	Nope, just a regular ass boring mechanic. I flew with the crew though, for when we landed where there weren't any mechanics.
t1_du2xhy2	0	*	Ya the speed of the descent suggests what, 50ft per second? That's certainly not a nosedive at that speed.
t1_du2wg6h	0	*	Never forget that dude who took a pic of his flight and jokingly said this is what my plane looks like in case it goes missing then went missing. 
t1_du345ua	0	*	Actually most plane crashes leave enough of your body for your family to bury something.
t1_du31vxq	0	*	Are we talking about the US shooting down the Iranian airliner?
t1_du35m8a	0	*	Says the man called out for making an illogical claim. Projection at its finest. 
t1_du2wfno	1	*	Never Forget...

t1_du35o12	1	*	Yup. It's on YouTube to watch free of charge 
t1_du306xf	1	*	  Germany?

t1_du30061	0	*	What countries fare the worst?
t1_du4oxnx	1	*	it means they have an image they protect through information campaigns.
t1_du2xdzz	0	*	Why perpetuate the insanity of multiple spellings when only one pronunciation is done verbally? 
t1_du403gd	0	*	Not the first time I've heard this argument. Someone else pointed out to me once long ago that humans cannot exist in two dimensions - we'd split in half at the tube from mouth to anus.
t1_du4d0in	0	*	Maybe... 2nd flight recorder has been found. Maybe now well know the cause. Flight only lasted 4 minutes. So it mustve been abrupt. 
t1_du2w245	0	*	I dont think that plane even had a phalange....
t1_du33v3n	0	*	He said exactly that wth the last comment and you still disagreed
t1_du2x92l	0	*	Yep.  Your chances of dying are a lot higher on the drive to the airport than on the flight itself.
t1_du2weik	0	*	9/11
t1_du306yp	1	*	Maybe two months ago?  Plowed into a gas station.  Granted it was one of those smaller prop planes
t1_du2zod8	0	*	a/s/l?
t1_du3g3wq	1	*	People is used to imperial in aviation and it also makes easy flight level divisions (i.e. FL 320 -> 32000ft) 
t1_du2xa4p	0	*	Guess I picked the wrong week to stop sniffing glue
t1_du32nl3	0	*	There was also a Sov flight crew who tried to land their commercial flight with curtains pulled over the cockpit windows just to show off... they crashed into the runway and like 75 people died 
t1_du3fhvb	0	*	That doesn't mean there isn't a high risk someone else kills.
t1_du2xno2	0	*	Aviation is different. And since the US is far and away the best at ATC, maybe other countries should take a page out of our book in that regard.

t1_du37nzu	0	*	Meh, I just like driving. I'm all for self driving cars, as long as it's a long time before all old fashioned cars are banned. Nothing like a Sunday drive through the country in a classic car.
t1_du32muj	1	*	IT'S NOT! A pilot can crash one plane, down maybe two. A plane fixer CAN CRASH MANY
t1_du2xr2c	0	*	But those could likely be your own fault, at least partially, and potentially survivable. In a plane you are just helpless and probably have no hope of survival, so it's a little more grim.

t1_dta6cjk	0	*	Ok, point taken.  In quite a few EU countries insulting other people in public is illegal too, though.
t1_dta31d1	1	*	I don't think those principles are necessarily contradictory. One can be against institutional punishment for speech while also wanting people to interact with one another in a respectful manner.

t1_dtafbji	1	*	And here comes the slippery slope argument again. That law is more than 70 years old, the slope seems pretty sticky in my opinion.  On who defines it? That the court, meaning independent judges.
t1_dta2vlp	1	*	I guess I misunderstood you, my bad. I thought you meant that it isn't illegal and it isn't okay why she was still sued. I see your other points though.

t1_dt9w73s	0	*	Even worse in a country like Germany that doesn't play when it comes to anything Nazi related
t1_dt9x0eu	0	*	Nazism all about authority figures though. You really can't separate the most famous authoritarian ideology from authoritarianism. Its kind of contradictory to say what you just said.
t1_dta42iu	0	*	Yes but that's not so easy to prove in court.
t1_dtaq2ug	0	*	Only Nazis ask for that anyway.
t1_dt9ydnp	0	*	No, Im asking if theres a moral and ideological difference between the use of words Jew or new in this context. I dont think there is.

t1_dta3i4x	0	*	I could say the same of you...
t1_dta4txn	0	*	Maybe in the states, other countries don't allow the military to shoot passenger planes down. One life on the ground isn't worth more as one on the plane.

t1_dt9x2lo	0	*	They don't even understand that you can study comp sci with a liberal arts education or something.
t1_dta22ae	0	*	You can say whatever you want. You just need to have proof for your claims and you can't insult people. I know that concept must seem strange for an American.
t1_dta6uwf	1	*	America would still be a British colony if it weren't for the French, your country is only 200 years old, chill out and read some history.
t1_dtah16d	0	*	Liberalism is not leftist, it is centerist. Thats why you can't have extremist liberals because there's no such thing as extreme centrism.

t1_dtbnzha	1	*	It's simple. Free speech is free speech but don't expect to get mad at the consequences of having people express freely their backlash or opposition towards yours.
t1_dtaibd4	0	*	I've found people would often substitute Anfxfchrer in contexts like your story to avoid the whole Hitler thing. As I got older, shortly before my Abitur and at Uni, we'd use Group leader too.

t1_dtcevwp	1	*	Drones make it cheaper and less risky to attack targets. So you will see more weddings etc bombed because more strikes will be ordered.

t1_dta29jy	0	*	See. That's what I mean. Liberal isn't left. It isn't right either.  You don't even understand the basics. And then you throw in extremist for good measure.
t1_dta6kmb	0	*	I did 5-10minutes research on the nutter. She refuses to believe that drone strikes cause collateral damage, they only ever get entirely legitimate badmen targets. 
t1_dtbzo6t	0	*	ahahhaha thanks that made my day
t1_dt9xaxl	0	*	Having a nive haircut is 100% proof of being a nazi, I assure you. I used Sience^TM to come to this conclusion.

t1_dta1eiq	0	*	It seems like the only reason she has a wiki article is because she stirs up trouble. I think it should be there, and obviously so do others.

t1_dtakhe8	1	*	Some people have legit anxiety attacks thinking everyone's out to get them.
t1_dtat64g	0	*	The drone strikes hit <suspected> terrorists. They are identified by using the military intel equivalent of googling their addresses. You don't find anything odd with that? 
t1_dte5f82	1	*	What are you doing if I may ask. Want to pursue political science.
t1_dtar5eg	1	*	Eh. Equity is a pretty sjw thing as it is equality of outcome. Equality is equality of opportunity. Other than that yeah some idiots have misused it too much but it has a set definition.

t1_dt9xdbv	0	*	Yes. For a rather small minority. In General calling someone a Nazi in Germany is rather offensive and will not be taken lightly.
t1_dtaflh3	1	*	No it's different. In this situation in Germany you actually get your money back if you're found not guilty, unlike civil forfeiture

t1_dtabr9i	0	*	fighting words in the USA aren't protected, as was established 9-0 in a base where someone was arrested for calling someone else a fascist. sounds familiar.
t1_dt9wnqb	0	*	So the police are Nazis because they do bad things sometimes. And yeah, as all historians agree, the one thing that *truly* defines a Nazi is making jokes and not caring about bullying   
t1_dta6a5f	1	*	She clearly means some people can't read duh.
t1_dt9xufr	0	*	I wonder if this subreddit would acknowledge that calling Trump (a leader who has commited exactly 0 atrocities) a Nazi is idiotic as well.

t1_dt9vzeb	1	*	This I agree then.
t1_dtaby0b	1	*	Sounds familiar for some reason, mad man ideals spreading through desperate people. Not sure from where through.
t1_dtauvw0	0	*	How does this work, exactly? If it's illegal to insult people in Germany, but she's doing it from the US?   I'm curious how this is all going to pan out. I hope we get an update at some point.
t1_dta3s4u	1	*	Legally it's not. Same for soap bars.  I've checked this thoroughly many times because I only travel with these products since I travel with only hand luggage.

t1_dta0s1v	0	*	She seems like the kind that will tell you she is, but in reality is only up to the point it even slightly inconveniences her.   I didn't know that though. That's super fucked up.

t1_dta48s3	0	*	Well then I frankly have no idea what she was wanted to hear instead of miss.
t1_dtai0mq	0	*	Against the law can only happen with power + prejudice. Women are marginalized in this patriarchal society and don't have the power to be against the law by definition. 
t1_dtav1sw	1	*	Ah yes, he should have gone anti-clockwise shouldnt he....  i was wrong
t1_dtaa1k9	1	*	Hitler was born in Australia, which explains why he hated immigrants and rounded them up and put them in camps in other countries.

t1_dt9x9lt	0	*	Is that supposed to be sarcastic? It did work well. Now you can easily identify a bigoted racist piece of scat by their use of er instead of a.

t1_du4eh68	1	*	That's alright because half of the people would still be happy to be on the road trip with me.  That's democracy.
t1_dtvf2z1	1	*	That's an interesting analogy. Not perfect, but still interesting. Reminds me a bit of when they claimed that buying marijuana was supporting terrorism.

t1_dszykpu	0	*	Yes adjusted for tax avoidance, which happens because of the outrageous flat rate. Thanks.
t1_duab1aw	0	*	Thats the only framework that matters.  Morals and anything else are a distraction.  I know, its 2018 and feelings matter, right?
t1_dub8rbl	0	*	Look it up.  She's got a site.
t1_duafjqh	0	*	Sending a link to information that had already been made public isn't even close to working with the Trump campaign looool you guys really are as dumb as everyone says.
t1_duaawgv	1	*	The real tragedy. 
t1_duacjvg	0	*	His outreach to those groups was atrocious.  That's my point.

t1_duqi5zm	1	*	Mostly because of DACA. They also didn't want to dismantle ACA when there is not alternative proposed. I think that is reasonable.  
t1_duqakwz	0	*	So if you aren't in the registry you can just lie about it.

t1_durt8ke	0	*	Yeah.  Governments have no interest in listening to criticism, especially about their own hypocrisy.
t1_durrmw6	1	*	The government are a bunch of economically-illiterate morons.  The NPR podcast [*How Venezuela Imploded*](https://www.npr.org/player/embed/498867764/498906957) is very good.

t1_dur1wnh	0	*	Is that why the revolutionary were able to produce similar equipment after the war? These were British educated people not a native inhabitants throwing the British out.
t1_durijhc	1	*	I don't think any of it will reach citizens that don't support the government. 
t1_dur9p0p	1	*	The government does not control the means of production, so not socialism.

t1_dur6yc0	0	*	The reason is killing people is a whole lot easier if you are convinced your enemies aren't really people.
t1_dur67zz	0	*	America has literally backed genocidal dictators, when Cuba was an interventionist state they sent troops to help Africans in anti-colonial wars.   The two are incomparable.

t1_duv36jc	1	*	Not true, especially not all of them and when the USA did get involved it was well known. Our government isn't great at keeping secrets. 
t1_dus74d2	0	*	Not random armed civilians, but remnants of an organization that once ruled the country (Taliban), hardened by 30+ years of warfare and supported by Pakistan's intelligence services.

t1_dsfiyz3	0	*	Lenin, Stalin, Putin. The three Russian saints.
t1_dsfe4gv	0	*	Yeah, the U.S. is worse in many aspects, and better in others.  Doesn't mean we can't critically analyze the USSR on the great things it accomplished and theorize how to replicate those achievements. 
t1_dsg2a3z	1	*	Why Genghis Khan?
t1_dsfepu3	0	*	That very same article states how the EU investigators disavowed their own findings for whitewashing Russian involvement.  To everyone's complete surprise, of course.

t1_dsfjla1	1	*	If Puto hates Stalin so much why did he say that excessive demonization of Stalin was being used to undermine Russia? Why is Dmitriev being targeted? 
t1_dsfhbkb	1	*	Actually four Union states still had slavery.
t1_dsgibi4	0	*	Uh, I said I'm not a Stalinist? And look at a history of famines in Russia and Ukraine: since the one which occurred while Stalin led, there's been how many? 
t1_dsgctmo	0	*	>WOOOW I can see how shooting innocent german conscripts definitely solves racism! Slash Ess!!!!!
t1_dsfd7vf	1	*	Your entire approach has been white-knighting a Nazi den by saying it's just their opinion. 
t1_dsg0cn7	1	*	Serfdom was abolished in the Baltics much earlier than in Russia proper. Serfdom began abolition in 1816 in the Baltics but Alexander II didn't decree all all of the serfs until 1861.
t1_dsfz6se	1	*	He is talking about the USSR in general. Stalin was merely one f the USSRs many leaders, and while he surely did all that, Krushev didn't for example.
t1_dsfhdtj	1	*	Nah man, Batman in the end of Batman Begins is literally worse than Hitler.  Ghandi's also worse than Hitler cause he overestimated their foodstock.

t1_dsknk0z	0	*	Well at least now I know you weren't joking. 
t1_dsl276s	1	*	Mm, possibly. I was just trying to rationalise why someone would use the Brexit vote as an indicator. It is pretty much all I can come up with.

t1_dsd10wg	0	*	Not without repercussion, but without serious repercussions. Free for alls with 'infinite' safety nets are no good either. 
t1_dscs7lz	0	*	This is pretty solid advice. I have a few friends who took time off (didn't drop out, though) for mental health reasons, and they came back to school much more ready to manage college stress.
t1_dscsnvz	1	*	Police have to wear a badge showing their occupation. Concentration camps made people wear badges too.  Oh but what I'm saying is ridiculous because the two things have nothing to do with each other.

t1_dscwd7m	1	*	Yep, smaller hands make operator more precise. Women are the best in electronics manufacture and high-end watchmaking.

t1_duyy5dn	1	*	He doesn't talk with facts or anything coherent, he talks to emotion.   Like you might with your pet dog.      Funny thing is his supporters aren't listening to WHAT he says, only how it sounds.
t1_duyzi3a	1	*	Comey probably cost Hillary the election with his stupid October stunt. He was fired because Trump doesn't do anything well, including obstruction of justice.

t1_duyoupd	0	*	So you're telling me if Obama was recorded saying exactly what Trump said, you'd be okay with it?
t1_duymkf7	0	*	No, he won because our voter base is horribly uninformed , social media trolls, DNC hack carried out by Russia, gerrymandered voter districts, and many more.
t1_duyoydg	0	*	there was an amazingly clear choice and the main argument in this thread seems to be, yeah trump was clearly corrupt and unfit, but I just dont LIKE hillary, you know?

t1_duz307o	0	*	Yes.  
t1_duyzyda	1	*	Sure, but then GDPR wouldn't apply to US officials anyway. My mentioning it was more of a general point, but probably not relevant to the debate over Trump.
t1_duyoj6u	0	*	I'm not dismissing anything. I'm saying that the Special Counsel's investigation has been going for less than a year, which is a verifiable fact.

t1_duytiw1	0	*	I'd say /r is for russian or republican
t1_duyn7oo	0	*	Huh TIL. I guess it makes sense to an extent. 
t1_duzp9k6	0	*	If you don't like my analogies then I guess I'll just have to be explicit. Using a fact checking website as a source is just lazy. 
t1_duyjlbo	0	*	you lefties. although in your case it could mean something else just by the nickname :)
t1_duyjxz8	0	*	You gonna ignore the part where he says he doesn't even wait? 
t1_duzjm1z	0	*	One has been summoned 
t1_duz6tsv	0	*	I mean, he didnt though
t1_duyo2od	0	*	Perhaps you have a hard time with self reflection and experiencing extreme confirmation bias? 
t1_duysk8a	1	*	Break even, I guess.
t1_duz4lkd	1	*	Yep. And this shit makes Nixon look like a great guy.
t1_duykq47	0	*	Ad hominems are not an argument.
t1_duyulxp	0	*	ah, the old i'm rubber you're glue defense, nice one.  you know i'm right though, no amount of deflection will change that :)
t1_duyihxx	1	*	Yup and if you give up on being the responsible one not only will they accuse you of cheating but your allies will as well. 
t1_duyso9i	1	*	One less russian and this woulda been an awesome meme. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=3toX5Y91sWA
t1_duytwyv	1	*	> rich white man's consortium.  
t1_duywydu	0	*	yeah, but if if if if.    I'm absolutely absolved of my conviction/s to Donald J Trump because Obama muttered the same word 4x in a row.  
t1_duymhua	1	*	You're right that people have said it.   It's because there have been legit smoking guns, so people were right to say This is a smoking gun.
t1_duz5hxt	0	*	>spinning a fact means its no longer a fact.  What part of, 95% of indictments from grand juries lead to convictions is, spinning.    
t1_duzgy1b	0	*	I know he is doing this.  Mostly to support Turkey and keep ISIS driven back.  Which Trump has done an excellent job of.
t1_dv2fzvc	1	*	Oh, title of *our* sex tape.
t1_duyju8h	0	*	So you're gonna work for Fox News?
t1_duzqiov	1	*	Like... unbelievable how rational and concise he was compared to their current president?
t1_duz1yo3	0	*	Not only Americans...
t1_duzq6aj	0	*	A Cheeto Benito if you will
t1_duzgmbn	1	*	He probably knew it was part of the phrase, but didn't think about it that much until just then.
t1_dv0cu9d	1	*	Half apathy, half fanaticism.  I imagine his average voter as a potato couch who yells at the TV.
t1_duzr9nr	1	*	Did he write his own speeches?
t1_duywxuu	1	*	And had a fucking sense of humor and decent comedic timing. Not to mention some  humility, a work ethic and his hair wasn't orange and an embarrassing comb-over.
t1_duz0kw6	0	*	I don't think it is at all. The person wasn't talking about hypocrisy. You're the one who interjected that as if it was relevant.
t1_duyn8th	1	*	Mr. Trump, *GIT IN DA CHOPPA NOW!*
t1_duyxl8t	1	*	I had some serious issues with the Obama administration but he certainly brought some much needed dignity to the office while also improving foreign relations.
t1_duyy8yu	0	*	This is a question for someone at your local park restroom.
t1_duz4mwk	0	*	If I got shot in the head I would get up walk it off
t1_dsye483	0	*	I think they were competing with CSI to see how much shit they could get past the producers rather than the audience, but your point stands. The people involved at least realized it was absurd.
t1_dsyx87n	1	*	Did he ever get the fall for that? He was a flamer after all 
t1_dsyjbzn	0	*	Some banks use text messages for this instead, I've had confirmations happen while the person on the other end of the phone was staring at a spinner waiting for the transaction to go through.
t1_dsydbrg	1	*	Marijuana, safer than toddlers.
t1_dsyizx1	0	*	I think this is a big reason why I enjoy watching Mr. Robot. It doesn't feel like it's fake.  It also has one of the best opening scenes to any show I've ever watched. 
t1_dsygr83	1	*	Thanks! I'll give it a look.
t1_dsyc5ux	0	*	I was beaten by an Albanian border guard for not bribing him. Mind you this is 1981. I have been beaten by many thugs but his moustache was magnificent. 
t1_dsycvwj	0	*	You forget about Halle Berry sunbathing?
t1_dsyfgnh	1	*	Now i don't know what to believe
t1_dsyg67e	1	*	The old stole took maneuver. 
t1_dsyd6xu	0	*	I guess that's true, huh. You sound awfully clever. Are you perhaps the head of the CIA?
t1_dsyd7ob	0	*	But is there a hacker battle as a finale!? Hack the Planet!!!
t1_dsyiusr	1	*	And now I'm going to stop trying to get all the kook seeds. I saw it like the golden skull challenge in ocarina of time :(
t1_dsybjho	1	*	Proceeds to blow chunks in car. 
t1_dsym0b7	1	*	 It's too late, they have fully infiltrated our society. No community is free from their influence. The Toddler War was over before the first shot was fired.
t1_dsyf42z	0	*	Wall dispensers. 
t1_dsz7tvq	1	*	Actions speak louder than words. So just get a Nobel prize and you should be good.
t1_dsye5al	0	*	It had Elton John in it, that was the best part.  You can have a backstage pass! 
t1_dsyqa6p	1	*	Dunno man I'd rather wait til they're at least 18
t1_dsyuwkv	0	*	Nowhere wrote what you have thought. I mean, I have not been quite specific either...
t1_dsz7y7l	1	*	Drink one for Albert today. 
t1_dsyhp97	0	*	Knock knock...les
t1_dsyihmq	0	*	It was good. A lot of the original cast of the first movie wasn't really involved in the sequel though, so may be that why people didn't like it. 
t1_dsyzoko	1	*	Finally, someone who knows its possible. Everyone else here believes ipads are unhackable. What skids.
t1_dszy2d9	1	*	DON'T YOU DARE INSULT THE GOLDEN GEM THAT IS NCIS. It is seriously in my top 5 shows of all time.
t1_dsycfzh	0	*	Stop payment doesn't give the money back after the check is already cashed. Plus the banker was in on the fraud.

t1_dsykvb4	1	*	Happy cake day.
t1_dsz01qv	1	*	It's not arrogance if you're actually smart, huh? 
t1_dsye2ee	1	*	Chase doesn't put a fee on your account if you direct deposit like $500-600 a month.. come on. lol
t1_dsyclft	1	*	Look at this fat cat with his accounts.
t1_dsykcqf	0	*	Were talking about a 15 year old here. 
t1_dsyr6my	0	*	It is from Arrested Development. A comedy television show from the US. 
t1_dsz7z1s	1	*	Well onedrive for us works like a cache or a bridge. Whatever goes on there gets on network. So there is that...  If onedrive fails it is on our network
t1_dsye4o2	1	*	I have a couple k in my account twice a year but it has to last me 4 months each time. Ahhh, college.
t1_dsyc0er	0	*	I totally wanted a blank check after seeing this at age 8
t1_dsyhev0	0	*	In fairness it's all shit. The seeds are Korok shit and when you have them all Hestu takes a shit and gives you that.
t1_dsypte6	1	*	They are quartered in your homes and living off the sweat of your brow. You already lost.
t1_dsygpwc	1	*	That TVR Tuscan made that movie for 10y/o me. 
t1_dsyzmkc	1	*	You're assuming wayy too much. Ive known 13 year olds that get in with spookies and have thoasands of dollars of exploits just by dick riding.
t1_dsxs2bs	0	*	Okay now youre definitely a troll surely you know more about our own history at PH than that
t1_dsyfikq	1	*	Exactly. Companies spend a fortune on trying to design their processes to prevent things like this across the board as well.
t1_dsyv2t1	1	*	It's a bit long but I prefer #wedon'ttry15yearoldsasadults.
t1_dsydz9d	1	*	I'm more impressed that you got a $10 out of an ATM. 
t1_dsyhv9w	1	*	Sequel was such a disappointment. It lacked the charm of the first one and they pursued super easy jokes.
t1_dsycyq1	0	*	We only need to kill the children of the people with guns, though.  They are the only ones that pose a real threat.
t1_dszmrlc	1	*	Sounds uncomfortable
t1_dsyhd60	1	*	there's an armed toddler in the Whitehouse 
t1_dsylz9g	1	*	Don't be ridiculous
t1_dsyii8g	1	*	Hallo? Is dis ze police?   FUCKYOUFUCKYOUFUCKYOU
t1_dsydxii	1	*	Meh, I still like the show for the goofy mess that it is.
t1_dsycsgj	1	*	That is because they charge for excessive use of an ATM, it isn't just a passive fee.
t1_dsy4eet	0	*	Why do random help desk people have access to secret information about internal operations?
t1_dsyaw13	1	*	Nikki Haley mb
t1_dsyktub	1	*	> Iirc it was willfully bad.  Yeah, sure. I bet that's what the show-runners said everytime people point out how bad it was. 
t1_dsye61r	1	*	You mena like what I already mentioned in the comment chain you are talking in?
t1_dsy3b17	0	*	I dont have demographics, but Id say there is a decent chance that most people who consider themselves hackers are actually teenagers who are looking for laughs or petty revenge.
t1_dsyu6g6	0	*	dang. My memory is super foggy. I believe you, but I somehow don't remember that. 
t1_dt1k0pn	0	*	Damn. You're not even the slightest bit aware of the logical hula hoop you're jumping through.
t1_dt1k933	0	*	Youre projecting, I won't play nice and protect feelings any more. Fuck republicans. They are not americans. Deal with it.
t1_dt1jwbb	0	*	They're not so that's irrelevant.
t1_dt1l7h7	0	*	You must not be female, LGBT, non-Christian, or non-white then.  Republicans are constantly trying to reduce or remove rights for those people.
t1_dt1k37p	0	*	They had a bipartisan deal before Trump started notching about letting people with brown skin into the country.
t1_duelilt	1	*	Well that kind of pokes a hole in your youve never been non-white and have no idea how other races are treated sjw speech. You have no idea what youre talking about.
t1_dtp84ha	0	*	Being surrounded by magical people
t1_ds616lv	0	*	Are you going back to Europe any time soon?
t1_ds6j7lo	0	*	Still waiting for you to tell us from what or whom Palestine should be freed.
t1_dtxajn2	0	*	Interesting. So how did Australia defy Churchill in WWII to bring the rats back to fight in Kokoda if we were still beholden to England? 
t1_dtx49z9	0	*	He's got like 4 older ones tho?
t1_dtxbzcz	0	*	A Ute...?  What is a Ute...? 
t1_dtxbqad	1	*	The dude is the one that made the commitment, not her. Its not her problem if he's married or not. Thats his vow that he broke on his own.
t1_dtx5776	0	*	This short passage just thoroughly reminded me why I hated reading Austin.
t1_dtx9qii	1	*	And when you start giving it to teenagers some of them are increasingly likely to have already caught the strains of HPV that cause cervical cancer.   
t1_dtxfgut	1	*	Are his genes that bad? Poor kid must be pretty slow...
t1_du0do36	0	*	Haha, oh dear anti-semitic? Please don't just throw around words you don't understand.
t1_dtx8nnc	0	*	You are correct. This sub is extremely left wing while simultaneously suffering reading comprehension issues = downvotes to anyone not aggressively pushing the correct narrative.
t1_dtx47wu	0	*	The wife used to invite her over.
t1_dtxdhg0	0	*	If his agenda isn't religious bullshit, then why do any culture war crap at all? 
t1_dtx9jnz	0	*	>  I'd say they are equally to blame  rotfl
t1_dtxa1at	0	*	Conquering men in the battlefields, conquering men in the bedroom, that's the true warriors way.
t1_dtyf533	1	*	Yeah mate I'm Australian. I'm saying in these kind of debates gay sex and marriage is generally mutually inclusive.
t1_dtx8kqj	0	*	My point is that the people on the 'no' side of things were convinced they were doing much more than just preventing marriage
t1_dtx4uoi	1	*	He was certainly porking the staff member.
t1_dtxas4p	0	*	I'm not sure that's true, I had it at 19 and I had the same number of doses as younger women.   Of course, many people would have already been exposed to HPV by that age. 
t1_du8ngha	0	*	Then Palestine can too. 
t1_du8y7eh	0	*	they voted for hamas overwhelmingly  if they didn't like it they'd rebel  but nope, just more oh gosh golly those mean old jews!!!! style whining every damn day
t1_du99ot2	0	*	You lack empathy
t1_du992yv	0	*	No.  Is America punishing you by not flying you to the US for your treatment?  You don't have a right to enter the country of your choosing for medical treatment 
t1_du9c0mi	0	*	You might mean that, but that doesn't make you right.   The Assyrians need to check their privilege and decolonize the lands of Israel they stole from the Jews 3000 years ago.
t1_du8tzz7	0	*	The Jews?   Why do you think we keep finding 2000 year old Jewish artifacts all over Israel?
t1_du8s9s1	0	*	> How, by going back to 1967 ~~and convincing the Jordanians to mind their own business?~~  Pretty much.   
t1_du8rhof	1	*	Not even Israel claims that Zionist wet dream. 
t1_du9iki7	1	*	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzfkxAC-Bw8
t1_du8vcnn	0	*	Sure ;-) 
t1_du8v999	0	*	It's not an Apartheid. Please don't use buzz words you don't understand, it degrades and disrespects both the actual Apartheid and the situation in Israel Palestine.
t1_du8l7if	0	*	What hospitals? They can't even get basic medical supplies because of the blockade.
t1_du934bu	0	*	Yes I'm aware, and Gaza borders the sea, not Israel, so the blockade is illegal. 
t1_du96mhr	0	*	Pretty sure this is a bot. I have seen this same post 3 times now replying to different posters. I'm going to test it. Gaza can't get aid from land sea or air.
t1_du8yzs5	0	*	Surprise surprise.
t1_du8nj11	0	*	And the rest of the borders? 
t1_du9295a	0	*	Here I have a tip for you: try to read my post before looking like an idiot. I was talking about Israeli's land and sea blockade. They're 100% wrong. 
t1_du93ez0	0	*	Thanks for the serious discussion...
t1_du9rhyi	0	*	then wtf is the point because nothing gets solved
t1_du95qh6	0	*	My question isn't about how many it takes, even one is too many IN A CIVILIZED COUNTRY.  So allowing 54 to die over a few is justifiable? Yes? No? Where is the line?
t1_duhrr5n	0	*	TIL wheat & dairy are carcinogens /s
t1_duhqy06	1	*	Nah but when it sees how ripped you are, it commits suicideU0001f4aa
t1_duht5eo	1	*	Unfortunately, R&D for pharmaceuticals is often beyond the scope of what most charities would ever accomplish financially. Then again, it's not impossible.
t1_dui3ku5	0	*	I was referring to the housing bubble. 
t1_duhv1le	1	*	That's pretty hilarious coming from someone who's barely literate. So what does clean up your diet even mean? And why do people like Steve Jobs who try to treat cancer holistically always die?
t1_dui24q0	0	*	Obviously not, they would turn a more reasonable profit in ways that don't directly endanger people's life and livelihood.  
t1_dui26al	0	*	They can, but they dont, are you in reality at all?  This is how it works
t1_duj15ax	0	*	Interesting. What benefit does the extended release have? I've been on generic lamictal for years and often wondered what the XR versions were good for. 
t1_dujt1hw	0	*	Thats the very definition of NOT having skin in the game. They put the taxpayers skin in the game instead of their own. 
t1_dv5efzr	0	*	You're pretty terrible as a troll.
t1_dtpwhwx	0	*	Harrogate, yes; dear god that place is expensive. You ever looked for a house around there?  York I can't really say, I've not been there too many times. But I think I'm fine for now at Middlesbrough.
t1_dut6ttg	0	*	Apple and company might cheat on their taxes, but to claim the poor pay more in taxes is demonstrably false.
t1_duvjmai	1	*	Of course, but I dont think we can limit the worker struggle to one single date or event.
t1_dv4tweg	0	*	The Trumps probably see themselves as high brow literary thespians with a keen sense of humour
t1_dv4rvsl	1	*	Oh I think Trump is the most immoral, incompetent, criminal to ever worm his way into the WH.  But thats not what I was implying in my comment. 
t1_dv54jz1	0	*	So said Russian trolls convincing swing state voters to throw their vote away on Jill Stein in 2016...
t1_dv4wwfm	0	*	Last chance before I block you. Tell me how your comment isnt whataboutism. 
t1_dv5g456	1	*	Updoot for updooting my Updoot for Updoot before you could updoot for updoot
t1_dv4x4i4	0	*	What the fuck is that supposed to mean? Why is any concerned about Chelsea? Really? How is she relevant at all?
t1_dv512to	0	*	No, you're fake news!  [It's factually proven media has its own agenda, too.](https://i.imgur.com/KzhZoNH.jpg)
t1_dv50dld	0	*	Why? Reddit isnt primarily a discussion site. Its a news/content aggregator. Whatever is most popular doesnt have to be discussion based 
t1_dv5jmuy	0	*	Well see a Libertarian candidate that isnt an embarrassment when Libertarian ideology isnt an embarrassment. 
t1_dv579bk	1	*	To be fair, the right in America is far closer to Putin, politically, than they are to moderate democrats. So I mean... it's kinda fair play if they do say that, at least they're being honest.
t1_dv4rbix	0	*	Now youre depressed?  Whereve you been for the past year?
t1_dv5ppiz	0	*	What? Why would I use a gun on him, Im not a republican.
t1_dv4tbvy	0	*	Saddam Hussein had a trial.
t1_dv4vhod	0	*	The bot doesn't give a shit that the post expanded their own links.  It just knows that the first set of links are too small.   Mr bot coder should rewrite his bot so that it accounts for this.
t1_dv51xwm	0	*	An account created yesterday that mostly posts pro trump talking points? Hmm...
t1_dv54nom	1	*	Democrats are center right.
t1_dv4s7l6	1	*	At least google it before trying to be smug.  https://www.ft.com/content/d3923b08-bf09-11e6-9bca-2b93a6856354
t1_dv4ukxx	1	*	I dont have anything to say on that. I was only commenting on the claim that latestagecapitalism aims to be uncensored.
t1_dv4rvfz	1	*	And innocent children abroad.
t1_dv4vyy0	0	*	This was in the 80's, way before competition was allowed. 
t1_dv4rl5y	0	*	They'll still be rich. Maybe not billionaire family rich, but they won't go broke. At least Ivanka won't be. 
t1_dv56cyb	1	*	He already preferred a pedophile to a Democrat
t1_dv533d1	1	*	Not totally inconceivable, given current trajectory.
t1_dv5d6j1	0	*	Corporations are evil! Except the ones that spoon feed me information that I agree with!
t1_dv4umyj	1	*	Seriously- I mean, the world is too amazing to be this angry.  His entire comment history is calling people cunts.  He needs to get laid.
t1_dv5kc55	1	*	Never, theres a reason why theyre always embarrassments.  Libertarian views are deeply flawed and naive.  Smaller government and less oversight means more power for corporations and less for citizens.
t1_dv4v7be	1	*	But none of that is what happened with Trump's buisnesses. He just made horrible decisions.
t1_dv5lmxn	0	*	They used a made up document to go after Trump?  Also why did the restart Hillarys investigation?  Something tells me someone else is behind this
t1_dv4xlx2	1	*	Yeah. Theyre arguing on a technicality. When realistically anyone in the Kushner income bracket is making a plea deal because the mountain of evidence would be nigh impossible to overcome on trial. 
t1_dv4rhe4	0	*	Yes. 
t1_dv51u3d	0	*	Sometimes its just for people who realize theyre going to get convicted (even if they are innocent) and seek a minimum sentence instead of maintaining innocence and getting a longer sentence.
t1_dv4rujy	1	*	Well yeah you can, so...   Just have to be worth taking is all
t1_dv4w67p	0	*	I trust BuzzFeed news over Slate. Theyve actually done some really food work. And BuzzFeeds overall profile makes me think theyre far more impartial than Slate. 
t1_dv4wmim	0	*	Why are you still spreading Nunes bullshit? Everything you just typed out is lies.
t1_dv5i4me	1	*	I'm pretty sure it's 15%, but I could be wrong. 
t1_dv4trq1	1	*	Everyone is entitled to their opinion of course I myself would be thrilled to have her reputation and history.
t1_dv53gve	0	*	Well as you've demonstrated, some people will argue all kinds of things.  It doesn't mean the argument has any merit.
t1_dv4u4if	1	*	>The front page should be for open discussion only.  Agreed completely. 
t1_dv4vfck	1	*	Nope. I don't have a TV and don't watch TV shows or movies online. Is there some connection between DuckTales and this discussion that you'd like to talk about?
t1_dv4ym4m	0	*	Japan and south korea are 1st world countries and not western.     It actually means allied with nato/usa but now it just means fully industrialized country. 
t1_dv4tgex	1	*	I mean I think he spelled that out pretty clearly.
t1_dv4v24b	0	*	Ok. What about it?
t1_dv504kd	1	*	Agreed. They'd all be looking at today's GOP and tearing their hair out while screaming, What the FUCK did you guys *do*?! 
t1_dv4txff	1	*	Further, if you have a safe space, that does not permit you to advocate violence, as LSC has done.
t1_dv58po2	0	*	Dude chews out his partner for accepting a free soda on one occasion, yet doesn't see a problem accepting free hot dogs and soda every single night. 
t1_dv5folq	1	*	Neither do I. It really should be, you're right. 
t1_dv57pvb	1	*	But it's cold, and that's a deal-breaker for me. I need to find a nice, warm place to escape to. 
t1_dvej6rh	1	*	If life is only about how much money you make, I honestly feel sorry for you. 
t1_dv4xdoz	0	*	> Taking a plea doesn't mean you did it, even though in this case he very likely did it  Damn, try to keep up. Army of lawyers != Public Defender
t1_dv4vp9c	0	*	how do you think she would have been worse than Trump
t1_dv4unqc	0	*	Okay
t1_dv5jnxh	1	*	It was where it was shot. 
t1_dv55pck	1	*	Well words used to mean something until trump supporters started calling the ones they don't like fake. Your unsolicited suspicion does not make the source illegitimate 
t1_dv559oe	1	*	Same with the Clinton's. And the Bush's. And the Putin's. And the Bernie's. And the ...
t1_dv4xp4h	1	*	Some sources seem to make this claim indeed, as reported by various news media. 
t1_dv5po7k	0	*	>talks about intelligence   >your wrong  Mate...
t1_dv4wkxl	1	*	Exactly
t1_dv4s7cj	1	*	I cannot change your beliefs. You are in control.

t1_dtzlcpl	0	*	yeah it does, he said we would need an emergency budget if we voted to leave - oh look we don't and everything is actually fine who'da thunk it
t1_dtz9ka5	0	*	Define inferior? What about Canada's deal with the EU? or Norway's?   You are making estimates like the economists do... and they have been consistently incorrect.
t1_dtzky04	0	*	> Iv pointed out that all the predictions have been wrong.  But you've been proven wrong, so this is just you crying.  > If we don't, there will be hell to pay.   Why? What are you going to do?

t1_dtzkvlq	0	*	So instead of working to increase British competitiveness, they should just get rid of the competition? 
t1_dsfdgj2	0	*	Trump presidency... Holocaust... perfect analogy. You definitely aren't biased whatsoever. 
t1_dsfkus2	1	*	That is silly. Trumps comments on US government/media relations have about much bearing in Chinas public opinion as their government/media relations have on our own.
t1_dsfliv8	0	*	You do realize both Republicans and Democrats are attacking Trump?  And what is your polices beliefs?

t1_dsfj97v	0	*	> It's hardly a conspiracy when Trump openly tries to silence the media on a daily basis.  If someone is openly doing it, then it's not exactly hidden or 'silenced'.

t1_dsfdfl8	0	*	Do you consider threatening to jail reporters an attack on the free press?  Ed: I'll take your downvotes as No.
t1_dsfhgvg	0	*	No, that was before the price of oil collapsed. They didn't run out of other people's money, they ran out of OPEC money and printed money to make up the deficit. 
t1_dsfv2rk	1	*	Oh yeah then I'm completely on board. Well stated.
t1_dsfafk5	1	*	Wow. So awesome and original.   That's the kind of reply I get from my 11 year old son.
t1_dsfjf0p	0	*	It's oil industry failed because they forced out private oil and unsurprisingly socialized oil can't keep up
t1_dsfgyvy	0	*	So, what's your solution? Public funding of the media via television/radio taxes like they have in the UK? Only trusting non-profit media like NPR and the Christian Science Monitor?

t1_dtw6fvo	1	*	True, part of the resistance against TIPP (I think that's the one) was because of IP laws. Still got a lot of excessive legislation in that regard though.
t1_duhujyj	0	*	And thats a way better place to live huh? Have you ever even neen to America or only online?
t1_dugbgbh	0	*	No, it's because they haven't got anything better. Also, you don't need to write up a detailed geopolitical analysis to break down a single word into specifics.

t1_dtqgc6i	0	*	It's not alcoholism 'to him'. It's just alcoholism. If you drink 6 beers a night, you're by definition an alcoholic.
t1_dtqjwtw	1	*	If you do nightly shots regularly, you might want to learn more about alcoholism. You might be a high functioning alcoholic w/o even knowing.
t1_dtq3ywm	1	*	It is an alternate point to dealing with Mexican corruption and the cartels. We aren't here to discuss Texas HS history courses. 
t1_dtqq5q8	1	*	In Canadaland it's 6$ for 16oz of Microbrew and 2$ for Macrobrews.  My ingredients cost boil down to 40cents a 16oz.  Even with a kegerator I'm saving a fucking buttload of cash.
t1_ds8a40s	0	*	I'd like to read that agreement too.
t1_ds9361h	0	*	In terms of import, sure, but recent doesn't denote import, it denotes time. And you most certainly can divide up history into periods of equal time; it's quite trivial.

t1_dspuo7g	0	*	No they didn't to my knowledge.  One mass murderer plan,which is still atrocious,that was never enacted is not regularly murdering your own people out of paranoia

t1_dspwbut	1	*	Except Dominic was a thermonuclear device and had a fission primer with a fusion core. So it was indeed a fusion bomb and exactly like the sun...except the Hydrogen/Helium.
t1_dsp2mwk	0	*	Its alright, we cant all be geopolitical prodigies. So what kind of cash prize does the Nobel come with? Haha
t1_dsp3v0c	1	*	The ability of China to actively guide a very long range anti ship missile into a carrier through its protection group of ships is lacking
t1_dsp4bzr	0	*	It would be contaminated with radioactive particulate then pool and soak into the ground as well as flow out into the larger ocean.
t1_dspgibw	1	*	I didn't say they shouldn't. It was just a recent news item so I thought I'd add to the conversation. Seemed relevant.
t1_dsp2y7l	1	*	I just can't against that beautiful star wars analogy
t1_dsp4kkj	0	*	They fly into Alaska pretty regularly to gauge our reaction. We actually intentionally scramble our jets slower.
t1_dsp89qk	1	*	They are more like hypersonic cruise missiles in that they're supposed to fly at low altitude.
t1_dspb7qw	0	*	it's the largest bomb detonated but not the largest to exist. They only detonated at 50% yield and I'm pretty sure no living being would even want to see what 100% looks like.
t1_dsqc99l	1	*	Yeah that's probably a better analogy and with the same risks of accidentally setting it off too.
t1_dspiwso	1	*	I think he meant barely any s-wave in relation to the strength of the p-wave. Not none at all
t1_dsop4z8	0	*	You have a point, but I think it's funny you start the list with Afghanistan.

t1_dsr2okh	1	*	50 megatons is the upward limit for the atmosphere to contain, 100 would just blow out into space and glass the ground from the radiant heat

t1_dsp6sxc	0	*	True. Its just not super sneaky having that buoy out all the time waiting for the call. But then again, who would notice?

t1_dsp5m98	1	*	Can I be the one to point out that if you use this thing it's not the carrier you need to be worried about anyway.

t1_dspwdtw	1	*	 In the atmosphere? Horrifying. 
t1_dsp31os	1	*	Bottom line is you said in fact and its not a fact. Not to be pedantic but we live in a time where the term fact is thrown around and often means opinion.
t1_dspgems	0	*	Yeah, combined with weapons that have a ~10m accuracy and 10 100kt weapons will do way more damage than 1 1mt.

t1_dsrwjej	0	*	He might have. We don't know because circumstances are very different. You can compare NK and USA as countries, but it significantly more difficult to compare KJU and Trump.

t1_dsl0952	1	*	Capitalist, meet socialist. Socialist, this is capitalist.
t1_dslqy09	1	*	Same here, lad.  Why don't you answer the other posters question that prompted your obnoxious answer that apparently only you can use then I'll answer yours.
t1_dsl3bqk	0	*	Hmm always thought it was at min wage in those areas.
t1_dsl2iih	0	*	He'll be missed for sure,  these comment chains always bring on a mix of emotions.  Half laughing my ass off half really bummed.
t1_dsrjwxj	1	*	Oh so nothing about him. Got it.
t1_dsl40uc	1	*	That speech is inspiring and heartbreaking all at the same time when you realize it was given in early Oct 2016, just before the election.
t1_dslls1d	1	*	Captain shitacular is raising SHIT in Panama!
t1_dsl2odj	0	*	tell that to panama 
t1_dslcsye	1	*	-Listen to politically-charged music   -Get away from politics      Choose one.
t1_dsl4sns	0	*	I learned xe9 (Alt+0233) so that when I write words like rxe9sumxe9, cafxe9, or Pokxe9mon, my friend Desirxe9 will be impressed.  xe9dit: forgot the first xe9 in rxe9sumxe9.
t1_dskz0y1	0	*	I dont disagree. Everyone who voted for him *is* responsible for the state of the country (and world) under his influence. 
t1_dsls4pj	0	*	Right? Im over here upvoting everybody. This is the most civil, well rounded and well defended debate Ive seen on reddit in along time. Both sides made me see their points!
t1_dslfab3	1	*	What language are you speaking?
t1_dsl1s5v	1	*	you gota watch that curb your enthusiasm episode
t1_dslgq1k	0	*	We (collectively) voted in a lunatic, and now we have to live with the consequences of an unstable government.
t1_dskzzhw	0	*	free market or government subsidies?
t1_dskz0jc	0	*	I don't think anyone has suggested that Wal-Mart was never successful in the past, or that the failure will happen overnight.
t1_dsl5f27	1	*	I've probably not used Alt-codes or the character map in over a year. That is, until this morning when I needed xa7.  The Baader-Meinhofxa0Phenomenon strikes again!
t1_dslhrl5	1	*	you hear that?  Shitghosts bubs.
t1_dsl40wv	1	*	Can confirm, Canadian that had francophone school up to university and memorized damn near every alt code for Canadian multilingual keyboard layout.
t1_dsl102g	0	*	My rate, Navy, is IT. I'm not saying that I deserve respect either. I don't care but I'm sure you're trying to say I don't do enough.

t1_dsl4gfw	1	*	Oooooo~ Ba ba ba~
t1_dsl6n2f	1	*	When I was working as a copywriter, I memorized xe9 (0233) and xf1 (0241) because they came up pretty often for words like cafxe9 or names like Michael Pexf1a.
t1_dsl1gum	1	*	I think some of them are realizing how much scrutiny they're under now, like how ivanka has been laying low. I don't think they anticipated this much which was just stupid 
t1_dslidcq	1	*	And pass spending bills that don't dramatically increase the deficit like most Republican (fiscally conservative my ass) administrations have done.
t1_dsl9o39	0	*	Seriously, what the fuck.
t1_dsl1tj6	0	*	A phrase? You said something which was easily proven to be a lie - not unlike a certain president!   Grow up and own your mistakes. 
t1_dsl1fyk	0	*	Are you a liberal or moderate left? Keep a story and stick with it. Or go back to your t_d alt 
t1_dsl3010	1	*	You are too stupid to understand what an echo chamber is.   But by all means keep posting, its fun reading.
t1_dspjbxc	1	*	Underrated comment

t1_dslfnee	1	*	Not only his pattern, it's the pattern of Republicans.
t1_dsl8maf	1	*	Thats because those kids dont have their head up their elderly asshole.
t1_dsl9k54	1	*	Yeah saying everyone was hyperbolic of me, the super wealthy did hang on to most of their wealth. The middle class and the moderatly wealthly were hit hard though.
t1_dsmj974	0	*	Youre really having trouble putting sentences together without creative interpretation to put words in peoples mouths. Kind of points to a failing education system. Learn to read without bias.
t1_dsllpny	0	*	No. I like anime as well. You want rick to be white and you actively love the_donald while ignoring their homophobia.   And sure downvote me. Or just stop responding. Either way. 
t1_dsl760p	1	*	>I'm just trying to end all this hate.  By calling everyone you disagree with a teenager.  Fuck off.

t1_dsl3v7q	1	*	Thank you for offering a direct example of my point.
t1_dskzzaf	0	*	... This is how you become ignorant of relevant viewpoints. Don't do that. If someone makes good points, or brings up valid possibilities, you should probably weigh them against your own
t1_dslnbde	0	*	Is there a subreddit collecting civil discussions like this one?
t1_dsl2nxc	1	*	Who's supporting it? A loon.
t1_dsm0yug	1	*	The only times I've heard about Moldova are in the movie RED and when I stumbled on some Moldovan folk metal.  No one remembers Moldova is a country because nothing exciting happens there.
t1_dsl17y8	1	*	>But we all know that ~~reality~~ logic has a well known liberal bias.
t1_dsl33p9	1	*	You can't, but Trump, for some inscrutable, stupid reason, would probably *try* to anyway.
t1_dsl6pte	1	*	Why won't you look at the other comments where the obvious has been fed to you and reply to them? It's all there and it isn't even half of it.
t1_dsl6ukv	1	*	LOL ooops typo
t1_dslaauz	0	*	Now that you mention it, I think we're both right.  Quick search of a [cryobi video](https://youtu.be/-b7ORqBtHVM?t=40) pulled up Homeless Despot.
t1_dsl3ygb	0	*	German keyboards just have a key for that xb0
t1_dsl8nal	1	*	TIL Trump is my dad.
t1_dsl0s6o	0	*	Of course. I think that is what most of America wants, but the polar extremes dominate the political discussion and make it virtually impossible for us to have constructive bipartisan conversation.
t1_dsm2gfc	0	*	How would that work for the House of Representatives?  Voters would have much less access to representation if reps were selected on a statewide basis.
t1_dsl0bpa	0	*	Afaik there is a long review process down the chain of command to the actual guys with the keys. 
t1_dsl5ea2	1	*	r/LifeProTips
t1_dtva3qb	1	*	The attacker was part of a far right group.
t1_ds9jjvq	0	*	So people who are not as intelligent as me, and who didn't put as much work as me into being beneficial for others, who can't do the work I can do, should be paid more for their lack of ability? 
t1_ds9k04m	0	*	umm, you can say that again?
t1_ds9wlbj	1	*	It's also about the message.
t1_ds9vhpt	0	*	> I'm no expert  Ah, the classic I'm no expert, but I'm pretty sure I could do this better than a multi-million dollar company. Also, it'll only take me five minutes on reddit.
t1_dsam49v	1	*	Ok, now I know.
t1_dsh30ym	1	*	Ask for more. It's your right to.
t1_dsafv34	1	*	It cuts down on theft. No giving your buddy an extra burger in the drivethrough without it getting noticed.
t1_dsbup51	1	*	Perhaps, or maybe the US as a whole would become more competitive in the world market, and our wages would all go up. It's impossible to predict.
t1_ds9sv9c	1	*	You either count all this stuff or you have to count your stock more regularly to restock.
t1_ds9jeu4	0	*	Ah, I see. People should only invest time and money into things that won't benefit them financially. 
t1_ds9wn9s	1	*	Welp. No breakfast for me, thanks. 
t1_dsa79z6	1	*	Forcing this kind of meticulous attention to waste helps to reduce it. When people are less conscious of what they throw away they are more wasteful. 
t1_dsa8z4b	1	*	Maybe he means the competitor's commercial. Too bad you probably can't do attack ads, would be a real doozy
t1_ds9w5h1	1	*	Be a hell of a commercial lol
t1_dsd5eu4	1	*	Not most of them.
t1_dtw0tyu	1	*	What Muslim invasion? The one Faux News made up about Birmingham being a no-go area due to all the Muslims?
t1_dtv45rc	0	*	And you won't.  You've heard of triage, right?  If your situation is that urgent, you're moved ahead of all the less important patients, regardless how long they've been there.
t1_dtuhe30	0	*	This is why I love Reddit. It aint perfect but its a lot more intelligent and way less explosive than Facebook. 
t1_dtvcaor	1	*	Lol, you just got your ass handed to you by a person who works on the field, and you deflect to such a cheap insult. Pretty pathetic comment.
t1_dtuq8ai	0	*	It takes a bit of getting used to but I'm really starting to enjoy living under Sharia - Tinder's got much better since girls lost the right to swipe left.
t1_dtvk91o	0	*	$90,000 for an 8 hour stay, with two saline bags and some antibiotics.  I'm calling bullshit. You are a liar. 
t1_dtvomo2	1	*	Lolwat? This Is absurd, you think emergencies are ignored because hospitals are at *capacity?* they're not nightclubs. Jesus, Americans are fucking stupid. 
t1_dso7arc	1	*	He was talking about the many hypocritical conservatives and their obsessions with mustard and tan suits, not you personally.
t1_dsmrlc1	1	*	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Education_in_Ghana https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/African_immigration_to_the_United_States#Educational_attainment  Hope this helps!
t1_dsmdog5	0	*	Hes specifically referring to the people coming from those countries. When the county he is referring to is relatively homogeneous it quickly becomes about the populations identify 
t1_dsmvnu8	1	*	You're not the president last I checked.
t1_dsmqira	0	*	I guess you don't understand how immigration works. I wonder, how many generations have you been in the US? When was the cut off date for when we should have stopped letting in immigrants?
t1_du0cv1r	0	*	What are you talking about? How is that relevant to anything?
t1_du0v6y2	1	*	Im not your bro, guy.
t1_dst4p20	0	*	Oh, I agree that there should be severe consequences on Earth. However, one can say so without being a fucking cunt, but he didn't manage to do so.
t1_dstflae	0	*	Still doesn't account for those who lose their faith once in it.  It happened to mother Theresa of all people.  Sorry if that doesn't jive with your theist naivete. 
t1_dsm9uwu	1	*	Yes, that's the joke.
t1_dsmyp89	1	*	Ah, so it was more like Food Fight.
t1_dsmi197	0	*	> purporting > Anthropomorphism > admissions > hyperbolic  I'm learning English here. 
t1_dsmpcg5	1	*	Dude...
t1_dsm6l80	0	*	Please go back to the T_D you anti science troll. 
t1_dsmaqhp	0	*	FYI I turn red when cooked
t1_dsm7u9b	0	*	Please tell me how that goes against scientific research that shows invertebrates do not feel pain.
t1_dsmnbkx	0	*	Sure, but someone who might have their arm ripped off might still try to catch a ball with their absent arm, out of habit / reflexes, just like a bee might.
t1_dsm9haa	0	*	So what? Whatever it have less or more than some other species have no bearing on whatever it feels pain or not. Stop trying to justify causing other living beings horrific pain with nonsens. 
t1_dsmckus	0	*	Nah, absence from the market doesnt support better practices. Buy eggs, but do it responsibly... Or don't. I'm not your mom. 
t1_dsmbykq	0	*	I hope this is a joke
t1_dslqyzc	0	*	New research suggests that we can no longer assume that, at the very least their nervous system is complex enough to make us avoid unnecessary cruelty 
t1_dsmavy2	1	*	Can confirm am chef. Only got into the game to commit lobster genocide. 
t1_dsmq4sl	1	*	Dude, what if our life on Earth IS the humane way to end our existences. 
t1_dsn6vw6	0	*	But being a vegetarian allows the consumption of eggs. If anything it would encourage free range more than battery farmed which is more expensive! 
t1_dsmghxy	0	*	The problems I mentioned can not be solved like that. If they could be, they wouldn't be problems.
t1_dslqx5j	0	*	So would you prefer to be burned alived or given a shot of morphine? Youll die either way, I guess it makes no difference then! 
t1_dsmkj2y	1	*	It's a lobster though. A giant bug. Not a dog, not a pig, not a deer, not a person. A lobster.
t1_dsm8xq0	1	*	If they've been in the freezer wouldn't it take even longer for them to die by boiling since they're cold? And wouldn't they instantly wake up from the hot water if temperature causes them to sleep?
t1_dsmb24n	1	*	Depends on the bugspray. 
t1_dsmanan	1	*	You cut it seconds before it hits the water. It doesn't make a difference, you have a couple hours before meat starts to degrade   
t1_dsman8x	0	*	But what are the consequences of boiling them alive then? There has to be *some* reason for people to want the method banned
t1_dsmfqaw	1	*	That's very insightful, thank you.
t1_dsm9elf	1	*	Sort of... but not really. Ease of cooking overrides the exploding tamale every time. 
t1_dsmaneb	1	*	They don't have brains per se. You can't kill a lobster with a knife to the head. Look up lobster anatomy. 
t1_dsmhsyr	1	*	I've steamed and eaten grasshoppers, they definitely turned pink. 
t1_dsmnwe4	0	*	Wow, I bet the claws / tail were huge. Is the meat tougher at that point, or is there just more of it?
t1_dsmcu2y	1	*	Like, in the restaurant? I know industrial ones get all sorts of processing but I wasn't aware people use nitrogen in restaurant kitchens.
t1_dslryyi	1	*	For a long time we thought babies couldn't feel pain...
t1_dsmlmcu	0	*	If you behead someone and then stab them in the leg their leg isn't going to start trying to run away like it would with a lobster.
t1_dsm9ll0	1	*	I never said animals don't feel pain, I said there's a difference in the experience of pain based on whether or not you're intelligent enough to have a concept of self and of the future.
t1_dsmz2b9	1	*	The nutrient called lobster tail.
t1_dsm3riu	0	*	Is it? Huh.  All I know is I put water and rice into the magic machine and turn it on and out it pops cooked. I never actually cooked rice without it.
t1_dsmdga9	1	*	Simpsons FTW!
t1_dsnq7fx	0	*	Nope, you are gonna have to produce evidence, you are the one making an unlikely claim here. If you cant, then youre the one who is wrong, and you owe me an apology. 
t1_dsmf7gq	1	*	I mean, it's kind of a stretch to think one built in reaction in an animal is the same as logical and emotional thinking. Your sarcasm is kind of missing the point.
t1_dsmeyx3	1	*	well I live in a place full of freshwater bodies and I've never heard about anywhere where I can eat it around here. 
t1_dsmdv95	1	*	I never said I wanted to. 
t1_dsm61w8	0	*	OK, but then you're a hypocrite. The only reason you are able to have this conversation with me is because you and I are different to other animals.
t1_dsmf8w1	0	*	Ur a murderer
t1_dsmfrmh	1	*	Lol a study does not prove anything that's not how science works. 
t1_ds8xkbe	1	*	> 900 mil of reimbursements  So, we're not paying out bills. At least it's true to character.
t1_ds9b0q4	0	*	Then Pakistan would well be within its rights to stop the supply line if the US is not paying its dues. 
t1_ds8tdg3	0	*	But Pakistan Army won a asymmetrical conflict in two years. Asymmetrical does not mean unwinnable. Just US is incapable. First Vietnam now this.
t1_ds93tzm	0	*	Because directly funding the terrorists ourselves is more efficient. 
t1_ds8tsxu	0	*	He has 420 in his username. What did you expect?
t1_ds92nvv	0	*	Why did you move to the u.k.?
t1_dupb9y1	0	*	False equivalency.  Yes there are far-right groups that murder thousands of people, but there was also that one time a dude was stabbed by a communist so it all balances out in the end.
t1_duqquub	0	*	Caucasian, but I wonder who would care.  And no, nationality and ethnicity are two completely different things.
t1_dup8gf7	0	*	Authoritarian is not only a 'right wing' phenomenon.  Stalin was a true believing communist, not right wing, just authoritarian.  
t1_duppn2z	0	*	And who gets to define fascism?  Because from what I've seen there's a lot of Antifa  folks who want to label anyone who supports Trump a fascist.
t1_dup4r26	1	*	Was this candidate going in prepared to do battle against the mob?
t1_dupbeba	0	*	> With extensive formal education on these subjects and many years of professional experience, including as a teacher  I pity the children of Europe.
t1_duqd4b7	0	*	Except democracy is not opposed to fascism, that's why
t1_duoukk5	0	*	So you hate the French Resistance now? 
t1_dup0lif	0	*	That makes no sense.  Fascism is a specific ideology. One that doesn't allow for peaceful coexistence. Do you also believe that fighting ISIS makes you an islamic militant?
t1_dupclbg	1	*	This logic >Mao
t1_duphhxk	0	*	you are delusional. 
t1_dup7wlv	0	*	What do you believe was left wing about those?
t1_duqmpkw	1	*	Spoiler alert: im not a stalinist, im an anarcho-communist
t1_duq00gc	1	*	If you think that you can just negotiate with violent extremists, then please disband the military and police.
t1_duqmu1s	1	*	How, exactly? Slavery is forced labour, socialism is democratic control of the means of production. They dont really sound all that similar 
t1_dupbelv	0	*	[Such tolerance](https://i.imgur.com/LRKbHKZ.png)  When you use violence against your fellow citizens, regardless of political difference, you lose any sense of moral high-ground you claim to have.
t1_dup8pi9	1	*	MLK was violent, he was a good man and he understood the need to violently fight back against the oppressive institutions of the USA. If you think MLK was a pacifist you haven't read the history. 
t1_dup51ul	1	*	Don't even waste your time.  These people are deranged.
t1_dup0xbv	0	*	can you see your sphincter?
t1_duq3b89	1	*	It happens to all of us from time to time 
t1_duoqalf	0	*	Eastern Europe is way more sane.  They will just outright evict when they get pissed.  They also have that whole ex Soviet Russia dagger hanging over their heads.
t1_dupje6p	0	*	That contradicts your original statement. Ethnic cleansing isnt  feature of the left; causing mass death is very, very different.
t1_dupxrhy	0	*	A fight where the two of you are actually trying to hurt each other.
t1_dsbb95s	0	*	No, they can fine them or take their vehicle.
t1_dsa9527	0	*	It's clearly relevant
t1_dujsrjy	0	*	It isn't a right? Well we found the psychopath
t1_duv1dhp	0	*	Then you need to provide the same protections for every accused or alleged criminal, which removes a lot of transparency from the system. 
t1_dtyj59j	0	*	It was frankly one of the most honest campaigns in electoral history.
t1_du11r32	0	*	More prevalent according to studies by liberal arts students.
t1_du04wgq	0	*	Ask a group of heterosexual men that are having a good time if they're feeling gay and let me know if that's what it still means. 
t1_dtyycw5	0	*	I'm sorry... But it's you pretending....  :(
t1_du04uky	1	*	That's my view on it.  Too many things that just don't make any sense, unless you're trying to asset Trump.
t1_du1zh51	0	*	I, too, cry myself to sleep over fascism when subreddits moderate content for their intended audience.
t1_du0nvdv	1	*	And she's adamant that Russia didn't try and influence the election, which is laughable at this point.   I dunno, there's just something seriously not right about her.   
t1_dut80fg	1	*	Id rather say its just ignorance. I believe someone used that hyperbole and journalist just took it literally.
t1_dtkndw7	1	*	So how is this any more than a story made up to discredit the allegations?
t1_dtklugr	1	*	The court did not not decide there wasn't sufficient evidence for the doping program's existence. Only that there wasn't enough evidence for each individuals involvement. 
t1_dtkycd2	1	*	This is clearly a pro russia thread don't dare insult them 
t1_dtkr8s3	0	*	So you're suggesting western governments take control of drug producers that supply Russia, yeah that's not going to work.
t1_dtkpo1m	0	*	You saying sexual harassment in Hollywood is a conspiracy nonsense? 
t1_dtl3orz	0	*	How can you know that? The Russian doping lab was a fraud, all Russian tests that went through there are suspicious at best, and down right useless at worst.
t1_e12mow9	1	*	I love how you got downvoted for this, the people arguing against you had no idea what they were talking about.
t1_dszr1wd	0	*	Whether a movement makes legislative or social change makes no difference to its success.
t1_dtokm0g	0	*	Again your pretending they are two different ideas, doesn't make it the case. 
t1_dupq5b2	0	*	I'm not saying that it's literally their skin color that does it, it's their culture. The black culture that they've created. Their way of thinking.
t1_dupq314	0	*	What's wrong with that statement?
t1_duqdeso	0	*	Went back and did reread. Somehow I still thought this was Darfur. Slow day at work made my mind slow.
t1_duq9ab9	0	*	*Developed* countries. The US ranks above *developing* countries and behind most developed countries.   South Sudan is an *underdeveloped* country without much of a functioning government. 
t1_duqmrdm	0	*	So back to my original point. The soldiers were acting on their own free will. 
t1_duqebkg	0	*	At least they didn't kill and rape each other as much. 
t1_dsdubv9	0	*	So to you, that quote is an explanation of how in the past 8 years only around 3000 combatants have been killed by drones, but in 1 year 15000 *civilians* have died by the same method?
t1_dsdkxqg	0	*	Only a deranged lunatic would want a return to the indiscriminate bombings of WWII. For one, it makes you no better than a goddamn terrorist.
t1_dsdt1h8	1	*	>If you don't know what you are talking about, perhaps you should abstain from talking about it.  Is that why you're not talking about what their ideology was?
t1_dttlxco	0	*	Id be happy to look over any list of NATO conquered nations you have. Should be easy to provide.
t1_dt05kak	0	*	I am trying to say everytime thy launch a suicide attack another 3 lettrr alphabet soup organization picks it up but we all know they are all linked and all responsible for that shit.
t1_dsznu45	0	*	Except you said 2+2=5 and I just couldn't be bothered to teach you that it is 4.  Get out you braindead terrorist.
t1_dtfaxbb	0	*	Thats not what I meant. I meant more its inevitable. 
t1_dtfoqvf	0	*	Please read what I wrote instead of trying to be smart.
t1_dul8jnj	0	*	Are you just quoting something?  I don't think you've directly responded to anything I've said so far.
t1_dujqz47	0	*	[Look](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/14/us/nsa-shooting-fort-meade.html) at what happens when you go on the wrong road in the US. He didn't read the sign and went down the wrong road. Now you know.
t1_dumgxss	0	*	Good god. Hes really perfect to you huh? You sound like the Trump supporters that also see no wrong in him
t1_dulv923	1	*	They weren't facts, he made up the 18k figure
t1_duln4wr	0	*	Why not? 
t1_dultj4k	0	*	Hey, hey, we didnt think those two would turn their weapons on us. We just wanted to get rid of the Ruskies and the Iranians. /s
t1_duluhwx	1	*	The point is to kill people. 
t1_dum28bn	1	*	good point! I didn't really think about _those_ killings :P
t1_dum28be	1	*	Don't forget the IRA.
t1_duohibo	1	*	So what system, or part of a system, do you suggest we adopt?
t1_dulqrmr	0	*	I thought it was pretty obvious.  Middle Eastern terrorism is only a problem because Western governments have been meddling in their affairs for generations.
t1_dumisul	0	*	The Americans (the army at least) didn't lose though, they were definitely winning.
t1_dun1lok	1	*	You get the joke.  He put in references so it was worth the downvotes.
t1_dulzxan	0	*	no, the more bombs you drop, the fewer people there are.  (just some gallows humor)
t1_dulif91	1	*	Yep.  It's how rome eventually fell to an empire instead of a republic.

t1_dua6ue8	1	*	You mean things controlled by people? Are you really suggesting there wouldn't be issues in the military in such an event?
t1_dua8ljm	1	*	Correct. Im almost as sick of this defeatist attitude as I am of the school shootings themselves
t1_dua5nrp	1	*	Not every adult will have one and it's a lot harder to get a gun or license.  There is more control there.  No one wants all guns illegal in the US we want better control.   
t1_dua57yl	0	*	Didn't they try that recently? Something about a bunch of congress critters being shot at a baseball game? Didn't seem to help.
t1_dua9rka	1	*	Sorry but I am confused. I desire all of the rights recognized by the US Constitution and think there should be more IMHO. But there is a difference between what I want and what is a essential.

t1_dscat3q	1	*	We still have prison slavery. 
t1_dsd5o1s	1	*	Japan is as non homogeneous as the US was when they started letting the Irish, Pols, and Italians in. At the end of the day, they were still quite similar compared to now.

t1_dscbzaf	1	*	Oh I'm so hurt.
t1_dscd1ut	0	*	No, I'd wager it's still a better place than a poor, developing nation.  It's not the parents' fault some Austrians have the mental capacity of small children. 
t1_dschvby	0	*	Maybe it is an awful stereotype, but awfulness doesn't disprove anything. I'm not saying it's true or not, I have no idea, but emotional reactions to things like this aren't proof either way.

t1_duk7vz0	0	*	Actually, you're right. But that's kind of like giving credit to Hitler for the Holocaust museum.

t1_dukwcfv	0	*	I never said directly. End to end the reaction is 6CO2 + 6H2O = C6H12O6 + 6O2. Only 6 oxygen from water, so at least some of that oxygen is coming from the carbon dioxide.

t1_dtgz8sh	0	*	That first group seems insane to me.   Second group I sortof understand.
t1_dtgspgd	1	*	Obviously not! I did not read that sentence somehow. If you want you can make hunting as manly as you wish i guess. Just like any outdoor activity. It gets harder the simpler your equipment gets
t1_dtgys6l	0	*	Absolutely, I'd encourage everyone to give some! I currently donate to the [David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust](https://www.sheldrickwildlifetrust.org/) which operates in Africa.
t1_dtgs0jy	1	*	Chris Pratt gave the most eloquent monologue on hunting culture...   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkeEmYF8gOI  
t1_dtgsbhf	0	*	Because they can be a danger to the other animals. They can be more aggressive and start attacking other animals.
t1_dtgr47s	0	*	Dude, they're not charging the dead guy with illegal firearms, they're going to charge his murderer with it. 
t1_dth82sn	1	*	Props to you feeding your family. The big rack guys who don't eat the meat can fuck off.
t1_dtgsf8i	0	*	No, they are not bred to be hunted. They are bred to make sure lions don't go extinct.

t1_dtgtb0t	0	*	right they just electrocute them, much harder....
t1_dth4jw6	1	*	I'm not saying don't criticize the law, I'm saying you would criticize both the law (or lack thereof) and the people for their legal but clearly immoral actions.  
t1_dtgrx2g	0	*	Holy shit youre delusional

t1_dth1in0	1	*	Fair enough.
t1_dtgsw02	1	*	Im responding to someone who is suggesting these hunters hunt because of humanitarian motiativion. In reality killing animals is obviously the main, if not only, motivation.

t1_dtgra7c	0	*	99.99% they are charging the murderer with having an illegal weapon. C'mon now
t1_dtgvh9e	0	*	To some extent, yes. They can predict the weather, live in warm houses, and go hunting when the conditions are optimal.
t1_dtgt6gi	0	*	I know we have different opinions but saying he deserved death for a hobby you don't agree with is delusional. Sure it is wrong, unethical, and plain stupid, but those hunts fund conservation. 
t1_dti7r8l	1	*	Absolutely. It's a really interesting topic  to think about, and the discussion alone brings to light a logical perception of both hunting and corruption I wasn't mindful of. 
t1_dtgs3k2	1	*	Humans are the only animals that NOW live to a ripe old age. Go way back and the same thing applied to us. Just be happy we have come so far.
t1_dtgu1ld	1	*	Y ah canned hunts are weak. I agree, he didnt deserve to die but he did put himself in that situation.

t1_duqcwxh	1	*	Theyd obviously do that if it didnt cost several times more 
t1_duqcdrs	1	*	The US has about 320 mil people. The world is much bigger.
t1_dupi662	0	*	Hey, you can have our waste and bury it too! :)
t1_dupka9w	1	*	This part is important, that's why it costs so much.  If you dare question the budget, you're a commie.  http://www.pogo.org/our-work/articles/2011/ns-sp-20110623-2.html
t1_dupliri	0	*	Needs more explanation and blue links. 
t1_durnxa9	1	*	Your article projecting 5% was quarterly, not yearly. Nice try.
t1_dupy7dp	0	*	i think the ottomans were the last people that attacked europe. i'm not holding my breath.  but you just keep pretending.
t1_duptzu2	0	*	I don't like Dobrint either but the BER was long gone before he came into office. 
t1_dupss1m	0	*	Nobody argues to replace nuclear with coal...
t1_duphlzj	0	*	Because Russia is playing so nicely these days?
t1_dupkedg	1	*	I understand that 2024 is the agreed upon deadline but Germany isn't really on track to meet it
t1_dupk9jl	1	*	>  65% income tax  >You're misleading purposefully  lol
t1_dupqrv1	1	*	Damn you are a sad individual.
t1_dupma2p	0	*	They've probably had numerous extensions because public opinion doesn't support building replacements. It's a self-made problem.
t1_dupqmaf	0	*	Germany is pretty progressive but we lack in so many other aspects compared to our European neighbours. Our digital infrastructure is one of the worst in western Europe.  Its a shame.
t1_duphrb2	1	*	Yeah, I'm not sure what that guy's on about, you can even grow it outside in the UK.  There's a *reason* it's called 'weed'.
t1_dupeqt0	0	*	It's not all just propaganda though. I'm sure the French don't want the Germans dictating their national affairs. This is centuries of cultural rivalries as well.
t1_duq4h8d	1	*	You know, other than the former Americans. Unless we're theorizing that the entire landmass of the United States simply shot off into space, or something. 
t1_dupt49e	0	*	And only possible because it was manned by the collective armies of the Warsaw Pact.
t1_dupgbxs	1	*	Thats not the platform they campaigned on, thats your opinion.
t1_duplo7y	1	*	4 grams should do.
t1_duphe6b	0	*	Just want to make it clear to any commenters that the US needs socialized medicine right now. 
t1_dupjoc5	0	*	> The get plenty of benefits.  Tell that to Greece. (And no, all that bailout money went right back to Deutsche Bank and the French Banks as they insisted on punishing austerity)
t1_duphcd4	0	*	That one's right
t1_duplrp6	0	*	Not for a country with the goals the US has.
t1_dupz6bb	1	*	Touchxe9
t1_dupierl	1	*	Yes, weed grow everywhere and anywhere.  I was not as clear as I thought.
t1_duq9lnh	1	*	Uhh how about over investments in highly overvalued companies? Your quantitative analysis on the 2000 situation is far too basic to make a proper argument for what you are saying.
t1_duqk5a8	0	*	You will also be surrounded by run down infrastructure, underfunded schools and an overall ignorant community.  I live on the outskirts of Appalachia, and I dread getting much closer to it's heart.
t1_dupvx0v	1	*	Obviously. But it doesn't mean that the drug war is a sham to make people money.
t1_duphnsu	0	*	Uh, what??  Russia was *in* crimea.  Like, openly.  They brought in equipment, men, everything but their uniforms.  Putin is clearly more than happy for an open conflict.
t1_dupfkhy	0	*	New Labour:  -Introduced the National Minimum wage  -Introduced the human rights act  -Introduced the hunting act  -Freedom of information act  And a ton more.
t1_duvi664	0	*	Move away because companies treat people like slaves? No way
t1_dupnx11	0	*	I mean, we might be in different social circles but I find smoking weed to be much more accepted than cigarettes
t1_duqkdiu	1	*	Reddit Gold for this guy, please.
t1_duppu01	1	*	If it's not realistic then it really doesn't belong in a conversation about how money should be spent
t1_dupso74	1	*	What are you referring to?  Both the rules and Germany's breaking of them predates the economic crisis. 
t1_dupot77	0	*	Only if you make it so. You need a goal and a level head.   With a stoic mindset, you can re-conquer your brain's chemistry.
t1_dupyp27	1	*	Yup that's my favorite example 
t1_dupq6pt	0	*	Also the idea that us bases are enough to protect a country is laughable
t1_duplzel	1	*	Other than the current Republicans in power who plan on cutting the benefit, you might be right. 
t1_dupqznr	0	*	> Landesjustizverwaltungen  You just made that word up to fuck with us, didn't you?
t1_duqeeau	1	*	What about Poland?
t1_duphlsu	0	*	Why would Russia want to engage in conflict with NATO?
t1_duq4dlt	0	*	Deer are so plentiful here they are an actual nuisance! 
t1_dupprz2	0	*	If your news source is reddit, the EU love fest boner is way too strong
t1_duwvjyz	0	*	I guess your response was lost in various response.   http://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/nuclear-fuel-cycle/fuel-recycling/processing-of-used-nuclear-fuel.aspx  
t1_duq8mvy	0	*	Nein
t1_dupsgw9	1	*	You're welcome. I try my best.
t1_duprge2	1	*	Also not saying a war will happen (at all), but Russia is still spending and developing, and a lot of NATO continues to rely too heavily on the U.S. which is stretched thin.
t1_dupzrdu	1	*	Well, of course! As we all know, the only thing that improves a military career is having to spend multiple months in recovery ward.
t1_dupjzc0	1	*	This would help debtors pay thier debts.
t1_dupqh7t	1	*	I agree with this, but we wouldnt see results for years. We cant unspent what we have already borrowed. 
t1_duq0tuy	1	*	It has more alcohol only 
t1_dupytd9	0	*	You know, there can be [actual](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7R9kH_HOUXM) reasons for higher-priced items that aren't simply rampant graft and corruption.
t1_dupl3r5	1	*	Here in canada its 24$(about 15) for cheap 30g tobacco.
t1_dupwhod	1	*	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29119217  The study was on psilocybin not lsd whoops. 
t1_duplhym	0	*	Yeah renewables are clearly superior... if they would replace their current reactors when they had replacement power ready, not replace it with coal for the unforeseeable future. 
t1_dupho37	0	*	ya and there is a reason its been 60 years with out a major world war
t1_dupmavl	1	*	If they actually cared you know they would do it the other way around. 
t1_dupkp67	0	*	Even assuming accidents, nuclear power would be much cleaner. Statistically it evens out. Just goes to show how bad coal really is.
t1_dupi300	1	*	i'm pretty sure international shipping lanes would be safe from those evil pirates, even if the us military was cut in half. don't worry about somali jack sparrows.
t1_dupzd9i	0	*	No, France is fourth. https://www.destatis.de/DE/PresseService/Presse/Pressemitteilungen/2018/02/PD18_055_51.html
t1_dupzmxn	0	*	The more I read into him, the bigger a piece of shit he becomes.
t1_duqhxfy	1	*	Don't forget the border guards who shot other border guards and then fled.  Does the statistic also include people who were lured back from the west and then tortured?
t1_duphmcn	0	*	Why would Russia attack either?
t1_dupxuvw	1	*	Although I prefer Tegel over the Frankfurt airport.  Tegel is just so easy to get in and out of compared to really any other major city airport.
t1_dupthaz	0	*	How much is 1400km in real life?
t1_duqf748	0	*	How many would have if there was not a wall? Probably many times more than that. 
t1_dupprhp	1	*	Smells like R Kellys sheets
t1_dupgcw3	1	*	You jump to conclusions, and take a politicians quote who is pushing for support for radical changes as if it is indisputable fact.
t1_dupj64q	0	*	*stops looking at you
t1_dupk9a0	0	*	I'm wondering if it isn't just the military, but government largesse across the board.
t1_duq1po3	1	*	HK won the case. The government simply ordered and gave the wrong specifications

t1_duq0svv	1	*	Don't know any with that name
t1_dupvyro	0	*	wrong guy. I'm backing up your point.
t1_dupqnra	0	*	Germany was spending 10%+ rearming in the 30's, and 50%+ during the war.  A little bit more than 3.5%.
t1_dupk3fj	1	*	Oh damn, you are right.
t1_duqzcq0	0	*	Yes but would you say a weaker currency only has benefits? 
t1_dupi4l1	0	*	Holy shit, shots fired.
t1_dupqmki	1	*	the first two points are not so different from Germany, although its of course not centered around Berlin (but around Bavaria /s, only a little)
t1_dupv610	0	*	You can argue with someone without calling them a liar. Grow up.
t1_dupshlf	1	*	I'm not sure what point you're attempting to refute?   We all know the history man... Sad Gretzky in Nagano... That's why we're all so pissed about them not going again. 
t1_dupoivy	0	*	But have fun with your mortgage and student loans!
t1_dupy11o	0	*	> Invading eachother and holding the land.  ISIS is not a country. It is an extremist group that is being wiped out by locals. What else do you have?
t1_dupoyaf	0	*	You wanted infrastructure spending didn't you? Are aircraft hangars not infrastructure? 
t1_duph7cg	0	*	Im neither im someone who will never forgive Germany for what they did to this world, it was horrible and disgusting and it just can be forgiven 
t1_dupl8rj	1	*	https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex2r86G0sdc
t1_dupl8rb	1	*	I honestly thought Chernobyl would have something to do with nuc power plant reduction first.. also the waste issue, like you say.
t1_duphy7h	1	*	That is because our health care services markets are disfunctional and not competitive.    Everyone pays higher prices regardless if Medicare, employer provided, or individual market.
t1_dupr37x	0	*	Depends on the region. Build them in Baden-Wxfcrttemberg and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. Nobody cares about the Schwaben, and nobody lives in M-V....
t1_duq8hkh	1	*	Hence why I said minimum waste and not zero waste
t1_dur1rij	0	*	>  just in case the US feels like invoking Article 5 of the NATO charter again  what are you talking about? what country was nato forced to invade?
t1_duph1g7	1	*	That's the thing about relationships between countries, they change. We don't know when they will, but it's better to be prepared than not.
t1_duph5wh	1	*	Imagine if the UK and Soviet held your opinion in the 30s and 40s and just felt no need to have a military. Because after all, war is stupid right?  How daft are you really?
t1_dupo0gb	1	*	haha, that has been my life motto for awhile  Believe what you want, but dont piss on my leg and call it rain
t1_dupjc18	1	*	> They were centrist and very much right economically  Anything to the right of Jeremy Corbyn.
t1_dtn65kx	1	*	If you got out from my comment that I thought Republicans are reasonable, you should read it once more.
t1_dtn2ujq	0	*	I don't agree that I blindly trust trump. I think many people do blindly trust trump, but I am not one of them. 
t1_dtn3k8a	0	*	Hey did you know that Obama colluded with the Russians? Here is proof https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XsFR8DbSRQE
t1_dto5jsc	1	*	Right? Hard to argue with the facts. 
t1_dtn4v0h	1	*	Obviously. Have you seen TD? And they say we wanted Obama as a dictator. U0001f602
t1_dtnb7pd	0	*	Another Trump Voter who never voted for Trump but is saying all the stuff that Trump Voters say.  Huh, that's weird. 
t1_dtn3vb3	0	*	Lol so Steele was researching stuff for an opposition research company and didnt know why? 
t1_dtnreim	0	*	Manafort was in relation to his role in Ukraine and not filing the proper paperwork.

t1_dtp2wp8	0	*	Been there, done that.  So, care to answer any question directly?
t1_dt69c72	0	*	It's not. It seriously isn't, but its sad that that's the way you view it and trash rap has only driven you to view it like that even more so
t1_dt6pmap	0	*	Because the culture that is making more Chinese people want to get tattoos is Western culture. And to us, it doesn't mean degeneracy anymore, so it's time to open your mind.
t1_dt640an	1	*	> Stop trying to project your own values on other cultures.  Once again, you do not understand the concept of a basic human right. Congratulations.
t1_dt6es76	1	*	Can we go back to the part where you explicitly endorsed China's censorship?  As an American, you should be ashamed.
t1_dt717ty	0	*	Oh yea i forgot it wasnt real socialism/communism
t1_ds6sqcz	1	*	Well clearly not them because they are letting them in. Enforce your borders, militarily if needed. 
t1_dss7nom	0	*	I smoke but if given the choice between nearly no crime and smoking, I'd give up smoking.

t1_dt6hm8i	0	*	Fake news can include manipulative use of facts.  You can use the word your way, but that's not what it means. You can't police people into using your version of the word.

t1_dt6fnde	1	*	>Plenty of crazy people were good
t1_dt6l6c3	1	*	The problem with Swedish is not what is reported but rather what isn't reported.  
t1_dt6izkm	1	*	Thank you
t1_dt6rcs3	1	*	Right!? The irony. He only says that because he's 18 and WAY MORE MATURE than a 16 year old. 
t1_dt6vd91	1	*	I think if you looked up the meaning of fiscally conservative you would find that you are quite wrong. 
t1_dt6ipuj	1	*	Oh yeah. That  too.
t1_dt6mni5	1	*	That's what I figured, I just don't get how this is a bad thing. 
t1_dt6ipaq	0	*	Well put. Jesus-H-Christopher got his jimmies rustled.
t1_dt6gqsp	0	*	Hollywood still got a lot under the rug...
t1_dt6vx0s	1	*	he sits on gold.... the Catholic Church could end world hunger. Anything he says proclaiming to be of God is blasphemy.
t1_dt7arip	0	*	That the dossier exists? I think maybe the right wing media has reported more on that, eh?
t1_dt6k3yx	0	*	/s or are you really just attempting to prove my point?
t1_dt6j4ev	0	*	FYI, the church spent about 800K for commercials to stop marijuana legalization in Massachusetts and failed.
t1_dt7687s	0	*	Jesus is all about ministering to the poor. Show me more examples of how the republican party votes to help the poor more than I can show you how the democrats are.
t1_dt6ezym	0	*	Low effort argument.
t1_dt6qo0x	0	*	No they get shit on because super-edge-lords think they are being cool by screaming at atheists.
t1_dt6hx2w	0	*	To be fair to Francis though, he's ousted several high ranking Church officials who'd been involved in the cover ups, which is hell of a lot more than Benedict ever did. 
t1_dt6hvxs	0	*	How does the Lateran Treaty fit into your hypothesis?
t1_dt6km1m	0	*	This is the most reddit comment I have ever seen. Tell me which of the thousands of US media outlets are you familiar with and what journalists?
t1_dt75214	1	*	Dude the church is against safe contraception in the phillipines right now.
t1_dt6n6yc	0	*	I'm going to go with the ones who believe in the invisible sky man being crazier, thanks 
t1_dt64cfb	0	*	Yeah, religion is complete nonsense. Their value in other areas does not make their religiosity any less moronic. 
t1_dt6nnz3	1	*	Well I was actually referring to the pluralis majestatis aka royal we. 
t1_dt6oldy	0	*	They way you speak implies that religion is actually real.  If it is fake, which is most definitely is, then the Pope is just a the biggest phony of some phony organisation.  
t1_dt6atwv	1	*	Good and crazy are not mutually exclusive terms 
t1_dt6llph	1	*	So how many abusers did the pope turn over to authorities as he promised? I'll wait.
t1_dt7y2xj	1	*	Because, like you said, changing for fear of hell isn't the way that I would want to go about it. I don't want to believe in a god just so so that I can go to 'heaven'. 
t1_dt6rm1r	1	*	You're correct. He wasn't formally charged or found guilty.  Edit: reformatting to promote civil discussion without personal attacks.
t1_dt74a7e	0	*	Its been proven over and over again that the leadership in the church knew and did nothing. Those reports have been ignored over and over. 
t1_dt6jvdw	0	*	I went to a catholic school and they never teached me the big bang as a true answer. Although they weren't creationists either they just painted it as a gray area and believe whatever you want 
t1_dt6rx66	1	*	Are you driving yourself? You should get a girl.
t1_dt6cf21	1	*	Yeah no shit. You realize that gay persecution was a thing even outside of church right?

t1_dt6ox72	0	*	That's also true. Insulting a place is not necessarily the same as insulting the people who live/lived in that place. 
t1_dt6go0l	1	*	We'll just have to agree to disagree.  It really isn't worth my while to convince you since I would gain nothing from the interaction.
t1_dt6nfsx	1	*	Shit you found the gaitas flaw in my argument and now I die!  [faints effeminately]
t1_dt6t3ho	1	*	Cardinal Law was the guy who kept giving priests accused of molesting children second and third and fourth chances.  But he wasn't a child molester himself.
t1_dt6q73x	1	*	*Religion is a sign of intolerant and hypersensitive attitudes, and leads only to the spread of arrogance and hatred*  -^^^^^^not the pope
t1_dt6gclq	1	*	As a Catholic myself (please don't downvote haha) I completely agree with you! The sooner any sexual and non sexual abuse is eliminated, the better and more Christian the church becomes.
t1_dt6x2v4	1	*	Actually I'm pretty sure his post is the exception to the rule it purports to establish. Yours, however, follows it to a T.
t1_dt6jddu	0	*	Things in bread but not all round is sandwich. 
t1_duhsoz5	1	*	They didn't. The voters did. 
t1_dugoh19	0	*	The last one was shot in the head. Lots of people don't want America to have great Presidents.

t1_dugr1c3	0	*	Scotland.
t1_duh1yr6	0	*	No, to vote for Clinton, I didn't vote last year. Should have voted Trump though
t1_dugply8	0	*	It seems a bit silly to measure a candidates worth by their popularity. By that definition Hillary was the best candidate and the argument becomes circular. 
t1_duhk3r8	1	*	You can also ignore 40 states and still cover 60% of the population without the electoral college. California can basically pick our president every election. 
t1_dugwdy1	0	*	No one said it was. 
t1_duk4oy4	1	*	>implying people aren't killed by knives or other instruments and try to dodge the Chicago inquiry  Kek

t1_dugoc6i	0	*	He aint exactly a saint either, but compared to Donald...
t1_duh4r7j	0	*	Oh, I'm sorry, seventeen kids were just shot dead and I'm dealing with imbicils who still think this is a funny game that they'll get to walk away from.
t1_dugscnk	0	*	So he was just a terrible pick? Sounds like the Clinton campaign.  Made zero sense.
t1_dugtko3	1	*	They are actually less responsible than the voters. The electors chose to give the nuclear football to Donald Trump. A majority of voters chose not to.
t1_dugs7nc	1	*	I agree, media companies like Fox News have too many direct ties to the Republican party, and the WSJ editorial board is too clearly the voice of Rupert Murdoch.     
t1_duh1rbe	1	*	I like to imagine her with a book deal and a gig anchoring a show on TBN in three years.
t1_dugw269	0	*	It is if you know you fucked up.

t1_dugo78q	0	*	He is the russian hacker 4chan
t1_dugrua7	0	*	Agree with that. Was just naming one benefit of the system. 
t1_duh4xw6	1	*	Correct. I later added the actual legit story. The opportunity to use an SNL skit was too great for me.

t1_duhfq8a	1	*	Thanks!
t1_dugvokt	1	*	Most of them would have been elected with a small fraction of the eligible votes. ~~Plurality~~ Majority is not something most politicians know or care about.  EDIT because I went for the wrong word.
t1_dugpiop	1	*	And the other choice should be respected? A man who has been divorced 3 times and had an affair with a pornstar as his youngest son was being born?
t1_duh1jsm	0	*	What nationality are they then? 
t1_duh2rq5	1	*	It might be. I dunno. I'd like to see that point brought up in court. There are substantial differences between the two things though. I think we'd see that brought up too.
t1_dugsjg3	1	*	shit you sunk my battleship

t1_dugpdrc	0	*	Bragging about sexually assaulting women, cheating on your wives, raping them, and having multiple children from multiple women? Now there's a family man people can respect.

t1_duh8jr9	1	*	They are destabilizing established order, to give themselves more of an even playing field. If you can't catch up to your enemy, then bring them down to your level first.
t1_dugy3mv	1	*	Oceansa? I thought this was hunger games? 
t1_dugs5aq	1	*	Nope. 
t1_dugxs5w	1	*	> a dollop of sanctimoniousness  Maybe you'd prefer the ghettos to be enshrined as the ideal living environment, but the president wants something better.
t1_dugs003	0	*	She was elected though. Remember the primaries?
t1_dugwibj	0	*	It's simple.  Putin wants free reign to do as he wishes.  A strong West prevents him from doing that so he's sewing division and infighting just like he's done at home in Russia.
t1_dui9aj6	1	*	Why should Fascist have a platform and a party to vote for?
t1_duhaha2	1	*	He wants more lebensraum without USA or EU intervening.

t1_dugoqx1	0	*	Obama was absolute shit and a liar. Lmao
t1_dugtzpq	1	*	Just trying to use your logic.

t1_dui9txe	0	*	Not if it's your sole job to talk to them.
t1_duheuff	1	*	Just because they're swing states doesn't mean they are solely responsible for choosing the president...
t1_dugvo2a	0	*	Yeah and it was totally worth it.
t1_dugq5j8	1	*	When only 61.4% of eligible voters turnout including record low minorities
t1_dugonn2	1	*	If by grass roots you mean Russian interference then yes, grass roots 
t1_dugs0o2	1	*	The electoral college doesn't accomplish what he's claiming it does.

t1_dugtxg4	0	*	get mad lol
t1_duh0if2	0	*	Technically, Jonestown used Flavor-aid. 
t1_duiv10v	0	*	Do you have your own opinion about anything or is it just party line talking points?
t1_dugwdst	1	*	> continued to merely suspect that was what it was during the fire extinguisher bit.  Honestly, I wouldn't be shocked if that actually happened.
t1_dugw1s5	1	*	I think you have a point, can you imagine how much better his image would be if he just shut the fuck up since day one.
t1_dugpcvi	0	*	> Obama is a center right politician  I stopped reading there.  You should read up on what constitutes right, center and left in America first.
t1_duh00hs	0	*	Well since I edited the bottom I was trying to avoid this but I forget that Reddit doesn't read past the headline
t1_dugrxcn	0	*	Both are not official anthems though. The official anthem of Scotland is God Save the Queen and if I were a Scotsman, I too wouldn't bother to learn that song probably.
t1_dugwj53	1	*	If Sanders ever blurts out that even Hitler didn't gas his own people she won't apologise like good ol' Spicey. She'll double-down, down and down again until she's denying the holocaust.
t1_dugud5x	0	*	What are the proposed replacements by the Democrats and/or the Republicans?
t1_dugt1ue	1	*	HE'S JUST GIVING HIS LEVEL HEADED SURPRISINGLY IMPARTIAL OPINION YOU, I HOPE YOU HAVE A BETTER DAY!
t1_dugvoc4	0	*	He received the majority of the state votes, and the vast majority of county votes, a far more diverse reach of people from all walks of life voted for Trump.
t1_dugrxwp	0	*	Dead eyes, like a doll's eyes.
t1_duh0h3b	1	*	I don't think that word means what you think it means. 
t1_dugqeqb	0	*	the answer is Trump (directly) or Trump (indirectly)
t1_dugrp2v	1	*	Oh Flower of Scotland, that's the unofficially, official national anthem. Unless we're representing the UK at the time, then its the one about saving the Queen
t1_dugsfo1	0	*	BLOOD FOR THE BLOOD GOD!  CHANGE FOR THE CHANGE GOD!  DECAY FOR THE DECAY GOD!  ANAL FISTING FOR THE ANAL FISTING GOD!  (GIVE ME MY FUCKING DARK ELDAR CODEX, GW YOU FUCKING SCRUB GODS!)
t1_dugr8m8	1	*	Not sure that counts as an exxeption that proves the rule. More like a terribly failed stress test
t1_dugnmdq	0	*	Definitely also actual herpies 
t1_dugycr7	1	*	Too soon.
t1_duhc9wl	0	*	Wall.
t1_dugv5r5	1	*	There's no federal requirement to award electoral votes winner-take-all. States are free to award them proportionally or however they want. They mostly don't though. 
t1_duh1aqe	1	*	What options would the British voters have? Brexit with the plan or Brexit with another/better plan or Forget Brexit?
t1_dugvx2h	1	*	Wasn't the lady singing on an Episode of Top Gear many years ago?  She seemed really nice and big into cars!
t1_dugunvx	0	*	Ah, we knew you were out there somewhere. Come visit us anytime, well put the kettle on.

t1_dugvmex	0	*	...How are those two things connected at all?
t1_dugtmjn	0	*	And instead they get their voice drowned out by the swing states.
t1_duguate	0	*	Seems to be pretty false equivalency. What you just said was reductive enough that it genuinely wasn't worth the time you took to write it.
t1_dugx9zp	1	*	I lol'd. Thank you!
t1_dugrc9o	0	*	Who the fuck has Wisconsin!?!
t1_dugrbg0	0	*	I'll bet you watch Fox News and think it is actual journalism.

t1_dugz7rv	1	*	Ooohh sorry, we were looking for Gavin Rossdale and Anheuser. Close.
t1_dugs2xx	1	*	Why am I not given extra special voting power?
t1_dugrnec	0	*	What about South Asia?  
t1_dugxr00	1	*	Is there where I argue Hillary had no right to handle confidential information the way she did? Could we agree they are both ignorant on that topic? 
t1_dugn15a	0	*	I think you may be over estimating the effect that T_D has on political discourse.  Most people don't even know what Reddit is.  
t1_dugot3j	1	*	Republicans wish they did.
t1_dugzkj7	0	*	Also want to point out that every Prince of that shit whole (14) were arrested last year for corruption and worth 600 billion collectively.   Good argument though, proved the other guy right 
t1_dugubiq	0	*	What was/were the proposed replacement(s)?
t1_duhym8o	1	*	Brilliant.
t1_duidhk1	1	*	Dude, I made that up (as stated above). Azazel was actually my necro in D2, not an official character with dialogue.  Kind of hilarious that you included my D2 necro in your Diablo list.
t1_dugpqby	0	*	So why didn't bernie win? He was the best candidate we have had for a long while. 
t1_dugrs8i	1	*	Because the smear campaign hadnt lasted 25 straight years. 
t1_dugymuw	0	*	Except that I literally just made it up and Azazel was actually my level 99 legit (no hacks) necro in D2 lol.
t1_duhe9zp	1	*	I don't think you want to know, that answer is probably more than you're looking for.
t1_dugr8bc	0	*	In some states the electoral college representative can vote for whoever they want.  They normally cast a vote for whoever won their state or district but it isn't mandatory
t1_dujua9i	0	*	the entire article does a very good job of breaking down how officials from both sides of the isle are directly contradicting Trump's Tweets when dealing with our international allies  
t1_dugsbbg	0	*	We did have one, but it was her turn so the DNC didn't put him up.  
t1_dugujx5	1	*	Basically your choice of which flavor of shit you enjoy most 
t1_duh09mv	0	*	Compared to Trump, Bush is Mr Rodgers

t1_dugz4za	0	*	Can you tell me why she was better? Just curious.
t1_duh08vp	0	*	He should have just made for Buckleberry ferry.
t1_dugxd6e	0	*	The logic is that people in rural America are more american than people in cities. They certainly think they are, at any rate.
t1_dugtetn	1	*	Runs batted in: 666.  Nice.
t1_duh4bvr	0	*	Wow ya think? 
t1_duhanw8	0	*	Just being honest, and apparently you aren't willing to share your sources so I guess that's how my opinion will stay.
t1_dugrxzl	0	*	But just because your city has a million plus, my city may only have 20,000. I deal with completely different issues than what goes on in your city and vice versa. 
t1_dugu811	1	*	We aint Pangea no more?
t1_duhb3ja	1	*	I'm glad they kept him around. He was originally just going to be the season 1 baddie, but he fucking killed it and become the archnemesis. I fucking love that show. Especially his final gunfight. 
t1_dugpb31	0	*	Are you talking about Hillary or Donald?
t1_dugzbzn	1	*	Receiving money vs giving money to a country we're shunning at the time  You sure got him
t1_duh1ptx	0	*	No, you were intentionally using it as a derogatory term.  Theres literally no debate to the fact that its used with a negative connotation. What is the point with trying to lie about that?
t1_duho7wt	1	*	The latest tax bill is a pretty big change.
t1_duhfbk3	1	*	Bloody hell. I had never heard of that, what an arsehole.  Funnily (well, sort of) as I didn't know about it, I thought it was Boris you were talking about, right up until your TLDR!
t1_duh0jen	1	*	So Swamp Thing?.
t1_dugrt1i	1	*	If thats what you want to call it sure but I do think people live there. 
t1_dugrvuw	0	*	Bullshit. 
t1_duhcqvo	1	*	Oh no, I don't believe that - but I did wonder if that was the general consensus amongst those who did vote for him.  I think the man's a liability and a reckless vote. 
t1_dugqjhl	0	*	Sorry, did my lack of pussy grabbing offend you?
t1_dugse8z	0	*	So we won the war then. 
t1_duh0xdc	0	*	That is news to me.  Do you have a source for that?
t1_dugt69e	0	*	I can't decide if it worse when they mean it in earnest. Redditors as a whole are annoying af
t1_dugsaek	1	*	Lol... the right's talking points always boil down to unproven conspiracy theories.
t1_duglqy2	0	*	> Should we start waving off the crazy shit other world leaders say as well?  We already do, when was the last time anybody took a North Korean war threat seriously?
t1_dugsifd	1	*	It makes total sense. Our electoral college worked when it was created but times have changed.
t1_dugwvq0	1	*	Remain quiet? Isnt that the sort of thought that got us here? Is that what you want?
t1_dugw792	1	*	He did not have two years of supermajority. Not by a long shot.   https://sandiegofreepress.org/2012/09/the-myth-of-the-filibuster-proof-democratic-senate/
t1_dugrg32	0	*	Minor clarification: he's good at campaigning at becoming a politician.  The actual work of politics, not so much.  
t1_dugs517	0	*	None of his new co-workers at fox swore any oaths. Maybe those made him sweat.
t1_dugq6sx	1	*	Melania?
t1_dugrqql	0	*	Ah ok my mistake! I thought they aggregated votes on a lower level than state level.
t1_dugrhgl	0	*	Yeah, who knew you could just pick imaginary animals? Makes the bald eagle look like a dumb choice, doesn't it?
t1_dugpznw	1	*	2 shots to the back of the head then they threw themselves off a bridge in a duffelbag...
t1_dugs77x	0	*	It doesn't matter either way. Trump already lost the popular vote, more popular votes against him wouldn't change the fact that the electoral vote got him elected
t1_duh4utm	1	*	Yeah, Trump is the magic loogie.
t1_duimpmd	1	*	Bumblebees are so adorable. 
t1_duimozs	0	*	Immigration
t1_duht5yf	1	*	That's literally what the Russians were pushing.
t1_dugpnpq	0	*	The president who oversaw thousands and thousands of drone strikes resulting in thousands and thousands of civilian deaths? Yeah what a peach. 
t1_dugs6ye	0	*	That's very close-minded, you're kind of assuming you hold the ultimate truth and thus a system that disadvantages your kind is flawed. 
t1_dugv735	1	*	I like that. Some states are mostly rural and some are almost entirely city based.  Your state speaks for the people more than any other.
t1_duh1q5e	0	*	That's what I thought. Noooooobody.
t1_dugshq2	1	*	Not even 10%. Less than 4%. These people have no idea how urban this country actually is. 
t1_dugpkrn	0	*	Yet not the biggest buffoon who ever ran for office so my point stands. She was a better candidate. I didn't say she was good.
t1_dugtj1z	0	*	Lying on Fox won't get you called before a Grand Jury.
t1_duhqgiy	0	*	Not really. Even if the EU collapsed, the individual states need gas, they would just lose the ability to barter as a group as the EU does and thus would get worse deals
t1_dugxcx6	1	*	Happy U0001f370 day!!
t1_duhqla3	1	*	That's what I thought. 
t1_dugvas0	1	*	On weeeed?
t1_dugyefg	0	*	They've never had that legal right. I'm talking about other legal protections they enjoy just like you and me. 
t1_dugpx19	0	*	The better candidate didn't get the chance
t1_dui9q4u	0	*	But using a blog post was clearly not an issue. Right?
t1_duh3nul	1	*	Perks of being corporate
t1_ds8va47	0	*	It's called a sarcastic response to a idiotic comment. Try it sometime.
t1_duu3ua8	0	*	As much as I support the Kurds the idea that their desperate fight for survival is somehow a sign that the Muslim world rejects Islamists and terrorism is a very long bow to draw.
t1_dv3hfq0	0	*	>The idea that people are using the descriptive term instead of the meaningless one to humiliate poor Melania is pathetic butthurt.  Maybe - but it's also vindictive snark and you know it. 
t1_dty7kax	0	*	That memo was instantly discredited as well as secretly altered according to the hill,washington post,times and other miscellaneous sources. Its hardly what one would call trustworthy. 
t1_dtd9hq5	0	*	Not trying to defend him or anything, just trying to bring some context to the situation. 
t1_du5xmgg	0	*	That sounds like a reasonable amount of nitrogen to picture in your head thinker 
t1_dt2en81	0	*	I imagine whatever she went through to get to that point would make anyone mean.
t1_dt2w57k	0	*	Can vary wildly, it is sometimes actually pretty tough to kill yourself or even maim yourself.

t1_dt2wle3	1	*	That's why you aim at your heart, you get as many free tries as the magazine can carry.
t1_dt2ce75	1	*	Aw shucks. Youre making me blush
t1_dtlf20r	0	*	OK.  I should have stipulated modern reactors, because we put nuclear reactors in cars back then.  You win an internet argument today. 
t1_dtlqwxw	1	*	Well that's the idea they're going for, you can't intercept a projectile at the appropriate velocity either I don't think.
t1_dtlf58q	0	*	The guy doesn't know much to begin with, the barrel is the issue not the powerplant
t1_dtlu9ff	1	*	> vessel-obliterating charges,  The VLS cell roughly 15 feet from where any railgun would be realistically mounted makes this a bit of a moot benefit tbh.
t1_dtmrss3	1	*	Sure, but the navy has enough trouble as it is recruiting, training, and then *retaining* nuclear techs in the fleet as it is.
t1_dtm16su	0	*	A 7km/s railgun projectile can cover 100 miles (~161 km) in 23 seconds. Unless the enemy ship is moving evasively, predicting where it's going to be in 23 seconds is child's play.
t1_dtlng0x	0	*	Oh tough guy here
t1_dtlr6u4	1	*	In all honesty with the kind of weapons we have nowadays if a ship gets hit it will be taken out of combat
t1_duxj3gv	1	*	You're fake.
t1_dtvlcte	0	*	How do you know it's self defense, it's not mentioned in the article? And if arranged marriage constitutes reason for murder, then by your reasoning Iranians should be exterminated.
t1_dtw3ytg	0	*	Easy for people who are total dipshits.
t1_dtxhcp7	0	*	Life in jail.  If he wishes to commit suicide to cop out of his sentence that's all up to him, then again, that's all up to anyone regardless of circumstances.

t1_dtvsvop	0	*	you spelled hypocrisy wrong
t1_dtx5k3q	0	*	So you actually do agree that people who approve or partake in arranged marriages should be killed? That was the crux of my point which you didn't address, not how widespread the practice is.
t1_dtvv7j6	0	*	There's terrorists hiding in that elementary school  Ok, drop a bomb on them. I seriously hope we don't kill any children...   Yeah, feigning ignorance doesn't count. 
t1_dtvmpla	1	*	He/she pretty clearly understood, just didn't agree with me that it was that important to point out.
t1_dtw1enr	1	*	and people are wrongly being let out of incarceration and preying upon innocent people too.  That part of the system IS being abused too.
t1_duch4du	0	*	The science was wrong though, we figured that out long ago at this point. This was the EU being babies about America again.
t1_ducl7fx	0	*	Yep. Wisconsin produces some of the best cheeses in the world.
t1_dueh8xg	1	*	Who would kill the CPC though? The military spending is 2nd in the world. The state owns most of the largest enterprises. How do you prove to the revolution that the new guys won't fuck it up?
t1_dubz7fo	0	*	Well apparently it does, the West is literally having to go through the WTO to get back on even terms, did you even read the article?
t1_duczfom	1	*	That would be icky
t1_ducfpnn	0	*	Because the EU doesn't have ulterior motives?
t1_ducth70	0	*	Only where unsupported by evidence. Problem is, a lot of countries implement at least some of their regulations due to public pressure rather than actual scientific evidence.
t1_duckij7	1	*	Well a lot of the wealthy are businessmen and statesmen.  I know tons of military people who, when retired moved to the USA.  Also, Businessmen have no nationality.
t1_duca689	1	*	dude, if Canada bans import from China, you can bet your ass the first ones that get fucked over are the average Canadian consumers, and it'll be a nasty one. 
t1_dud91ae	1	*	No fuck that I would like WW3 to be started with a literal beef.
t1_duby9xq	0	*	No one in their sane mind would take Chinese governance over US one.  US gov't might be 50% total cuckoo shit and 50% bearable but it still aint no where near as bad as China.
