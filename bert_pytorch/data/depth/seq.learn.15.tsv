t1_dtlwjxx	1	*	O shit that aint good 
t1_dtmjo2g	0	*	But how much money would have to be dropped on the project just to get it finalized? Itd be decades before youd see a return on investment thats in the black. 
t1_dtlo4dd	0	*	But you are assuming that people who use drugs other than alcohol or tobacco somehow need help, that's a bit patronising don't you think?
t1_duc488f	0	*	This is correct. The only things that I know of that survives cooking are prions.  
t1_ducfumb	1	*	Fair enough
t1_ds95wcw	0	*	If were going to bring in conditions of Cuban people then Im just gonna mention cuban literacy rates skyrocketed under Castro, and they have the largest doctor training program in the world.
t1_dsbmhf5	0	*	Your insults suck. Your opinion sucks. I don't care to argue with a foreigner on American policy. Fuck off. Also this conversion is over. 
t1_dufsgzu	0	*	Blocked it is then, not surprising you chose the cowards way out.
t1_dugivvy	0	*	I have stated clearly dont trust Putin.   Dont trust a master spy.  If youre attempting to drag me into a conversation and/or insult, thats your concern.  Our conversation, as it is, is concluded.
t1_dsvpjap	0	*	Trolling an Anne Frank topic, good for you.   I'm convinced! You surely know more about African refugees in Israel, than an rabbi risking his own well being for their safety.

t1_dtx8d5v	0	*	Bud, I don't give a shit where you say you've been deployed. I've been deployed. Try a new angle because this one doesn't work. I stopped reading at your 4th word.
t1_dundy81	0	*	I have been looking already. It doesn't show up anywhere.  If terrorism is unrelated why did you act as if it was?

t1_dutqxb1	0	*	Good.  Now what doesn't make sense about discussing faith in the US government, when were talking about the US government mandating something?
t1_duvdw19	0	*	Do you have a single vaccine where the risks outweigh the benefits?

t1_durs76n	1	*	I don't know what that is but I am prepared.
t1_durs38t	0	*	Fair point.  I'm quite amazed by your name by the way. Is it a reference to something that I'm not getting?
t1_dus3jr5	0	*	So what was your argument then, and why did Japan's war crimes have anything to do with it?  Is it a super secret now?
t1_dure61p	1	*	Germany cared about freedom of speech, inquiry, and press in Nazi Germany? Why are you even conflating the two?
t1_durf04s	1	*	Churchill was a real piece-of-shit as a human, but damn he could write, and damn he could speak.
t1_dutj0fh	1	*	A common message. The practice is flawed in many ways. But each book basically says stop being shit to eachother. 
t1_durkos0	1	*	No problem, and thanks for being open minded. I often post on reddit to correct misunderstandings of the law (I am a lawyer) because it's important knowledge for people to have.

t1_du8np5d	0	*	I'm actually okay with that, but I feel like that would never happen. The cash would just be used to bail out companies

t1_dua3dqj	0	*	If you wanted to make it really simple, you should've just said I just don't like it. Because let's face it, that's what this all boils down to. 
t1_du90ikg	0	*	Dude, what you're doing is literally the definition of a strawman...
t1_du94v3p	1	*	That's rather silly. There's nothing extreme in anything I've said. Everything I've said has been tongue in cheek and based in reality.

t1_dtw30ak	1	*	I SAW WHAT YOU DID TO MY FRIEND!!!
t1_dtvxw33	1	*	Ok I was talking about American ranches vs designated high fence hunting areas. If we are talking about African game farms vs U.S. ones I can't speak to those differences.
t1_dtvfjka	0	*	It's about perspective. Is it not wasteful to cremate the corpse when there are hungry in the world? Is it not disrespectful to let maggots feast on them?

t1_dsk1nlv	0	*	Thats why there are 7,000 drones in the swarm....
t1_duo0u4a	0	*	Now you're just playing bait and switch. If she was favoured by the  base then the DNC didn't need to go through such great lengths to rig the primary in her favour.
t1_dunsm19	0	*	You should try visiting some developing countries for once. Maybe then you can understand why lots of people want to come into this shithole.
t1_dunpdaj	0	*	Well why the fuck would they come here smart ass? Why do millions of people flock to America? If America is such a shit hole as you say, why the fuck do people wait decades to get in? 
t1_duo2cog	1	*	You are a very open-minded and humble individual /s
t1_dunllxi	0	*	I explained my intent with the words, I recognized that my language could cause confusion, and made a change to rectify it. How is that saying it is others?

t1_duognsx	1	*	Just so your money doesn't go to someone you think is undeserving -- but the insurance company and the for profit hospital can have all your money?
t1_dunp28i	0	*	You're deflecting. Social Security and economic policy are nationwide, not individual. 
t1_dunoxos	1	*	Sure, never said otherwise. I recognize limited resources and my preference is to allocate them elsewhere. 
t1_duohaje	1	*	https://youtu.be/hSE_dNKVrGs that basically answers most the FAQ from left wingers and why a free market healthcare system is better then universal one.
t1_duo1wtn	0	*	I noticed a trend in these accusations of left wing authoritarianism; whenever pressed, the case they make is always in defense of bigotry, using phrases like different opinion
t1_dupx1ht	0	*	you can't answer a question with a question. how about you answer my initial question first instead of moving the goal posts.
t1_dyb547p	1	*	Hey, how did you find this comment 3 months later?
t1_dt3a1f5	0	*	I dont think a modern Jesus would be disparaging people so dismissively, he was a pretty nice guy by most accounts.

t1_dttc2zi	0	*	And still you* pay more for your healthcare than anyone who pays taxes for their healthcare.   Win-win, I guess?  /*you = the average free health care market citizen 
t1_dttc4nn	1	*	But you shouldnt be punished so heavily for being wrong once. Lots of things that are harmless can have very abrupt and scary symptoms 
t1_dtu3xjw	0	*	My government gives me loans thank you very much.   Her mom is dead you asswipe. 
t1_dtthlr6	0	*	He's alive, in many countries that wouldn't be the case.  50k is also far from bankruptcy

t1_dttd9tp	0	*	No she doesn't. Stop equating daily life to the fear of being very sick or injured and possibly dying.
t1_dtukxry	0	*	To the contrary, you are moving the goalposts on what constitutes voluntary. Also you falsely claim that voluntary transactions are not mutually beneficial because the state exists.
t1_dttci8i	0	*	It's supposed to be the rich people's taxes, not really your's.
t1_dttd9fe	1	*	Does GP in UK get pressured to not refer patients to NHS specialists? Or do they generally exercise good judgement on this? 
t1_dttcsyz	1	*	your problem here is that youre paying 5.4% in taxes, not over 14% like most countries without healthcare issues, or their countries shutting down for because their budget is locked.
t1_dttjgzd	0	*	In a country with anti vaxxers, you expect them to make sane decisions?
t1_dttnur7	0	*	No they have absolute power because employees always do what their boss tells them to.  Control via illusion of no choice is just as unfree as enforced lack of choice.
t1_dttocqa	1	*	And wouldnt ermmmm, it be the same in every other country, socialized or not, with public school? Lol
t1_dtuhyd4	0	*	These aren't the best things that SF has to offer. They're just worthy comparisons to what the other poster had to say.
t1_dtuqe9c	0	*	> Because there are people worse off than you are doesn't mean you're not struggling.  Correct, and not relevant to the discussion at hand.
t1_dttc278	1	*	Would rather pay more taxes and end up saving more money on the cheaper healthcare in the long run.
t1_dtto2q3	1	*	While valid, something newer than 40-50 years ago would lend itself better.
t1_dttx17c	1	*	Well everyone has their own opinions, Im personally of the opinion that if youre in a position that allows you to help others, then you should. Be it directly or via taxes.
t1_dttvskd	1	*	Ahh must have been my state disability then. 
t1_dttf30u	0	*	We're clearly never going to agree on this, but it's dangerous to just assume things, we were assuming everything was fine until 2008 happened.
t1_dttnx9w	1	*	That's fucked up. How's that better or different than praying. Even Poland doesn't have stupid stuff like that. We come to learn not to pray to Trump,wtf. That legit blows my mind.
t1_dttgk52	0	*	I've sent you a chat message, seems it didn't go through to you. PM me, I'm a bit shy to talk here, but I'd like to help you. 
t1_dttdfws	0	*	Im replying to this separately to keep continuity.   So no health insurance and no universal care. How do you go about paying for any major medical expenses (on the basis were talking about the US) ?
t1_duqpv37	0	*	Let's take your word for it and say he was doping pure and simple. What point does that prove?

t1_duqa0ct	1	*	Why not both?
t1_dtdloyr	1	*	Peace.
t1_dtdxgr5	0	*	People here often misunderstand the 1% vs the 0.01%.  Top 1% only make like $350,000-$400,000/ year for perspective.  
t1_dtdxl7h	0	*	Investing, especially through the stock market, extracts value from the market rather than creating value through labor.  It is definitionally economic rent, which is never ethical.
t1_dtnlt9e	0	*	You used quotes, yet Ive literally never said that. Do you know how quotes work?   Edit: there is literally a website for it called [TalkingPointsMemo.com](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/)
t1_dte10k6	1	*	Is only gehm.. 
t1_dtdyyph	0	*	It's literally not though. If it was true then all the nonvoters would have pushed trump to get 70% of the popular vote.

t1_dths0g4	1	*	No, I like for people to resolve their own issues, without assassinations. Especially foreign powers interfering.  
t1_dte8c8j	1	*	The naivety comes from pretending a world without that influence can/does/will exist and making political statements based off of this false premise.
t1_dupfk41	0	*	Not really. In fact I've stated in an earlier post that the previous version of the estate tax wouldn't have even affected me. I just am glad it was weakened on principle 
t1_dsuiw0p	0	*	The PLO was formed in 1965 to liberate palestine from the river to the sea. There was no occupation until 1967
t1_dv529cc	0	*	Once again, you've fallen into an Educational Dysfunction (ED) trap.  North Korea was pursuing nuclear weapons far in advance of anything that happened during the Arab Spring.
t1_dv074zr	1	*	I think a Nuclear belligerent North Korea is a special circumstance, and the world would understand that.
t1_dsa9ohi	0	*	I know that's what you're saying, and it's a strawman argument. All mass killing is wrong, not just for Jews, apparently that needs to be said here. 
t1_ds9h1k0	0	*	> So now you're drawing a comparison to the Contras? >  >   No I'm talking about Hezbollah and Hamas.
t1_ds9gz5p	1	*	If you go over to kill your neighbor and he hides behind his wife and kids so you kill them...yes, that's your fault...using your fucking retarded anology...
t1_dshztd6	1	*	But hes not doing nothing. Hes still droning civilians and we still support rebels. Hes also allowed the Yemen conflict to grow and fester. 
t1_dsa8gf8	0	*	You're the one who wants them to starve to death so why do you think I'm the one who doesn't care about them? 
t1_dsa7wh7	1	*	What? Nope, it's not a common resource dude, that's why it has so much value. The price of the oil on the global market its what gives power to it. Not the states.
t1_dsatar5	0	*	> fell out of favor  You mean it was judged a *war crime for which people were hanged.*
t1_dujhvft	1	*	What is bollocks?

t1_dunlqaf	0	*	I'm not missing the point.  I don't believe for a second you can have a volunteer force to provide appropriate on-site security that is adequate to confront an active shooter in that environment.

t1_dt7g7d4	0	*	You're a muslim, you should know this.
t1_dt6r088	0	*	From what I can tell, it mostly stopped it; but they still burn brides for their life i\nsurance, I think
t1_dt6rguh	0	*	We call Europe/US countries Christian even though they don't follow  Bible doctrine.
t1_dt6rovx	0	*	If you dont think singling out a major faith isnt bigoted, then theres no point in continuing this argument. Well never reach a common ground. 
t1_dt8s81y	0	*	Because how do you stop 201 other people from taking what you own
t1_dum8fsg	1	*	He did provide evidence. For the other guy I am challenging his comment. If he has no counter points, he should stop posting useless comments, like you. 
t1_dum594t	0	*	You're the one who challenged his claims in the first place. Don't have anything to back it up? Shut the fuck up
t1_dv0up3k	0	*	Tell me, how was the IRA beaten?
t1_dv0vx81	0	*	Well have you ever seen war? Your family killed by bombs? Your nation wrecked?  All for lies and the arrogance of foreign leaders?  Can you see how that might make people violent?
t1_dv0mum1	0	*	Dont need to kill them if they dont exist in the first place, and the way to stop them from existing is to stop giving them reasons to become terrorists
t1_du0uwip	1	*	That's what you say to crazy girls, not taking landlords to court for breaking the law
t1_duxyvxy	1	*	That's not what an oxymoron is. It's close but correct.
t1_duxp7o4	0	*	>being this mad
t1_duvngjc	1	*	Their politics are akin to white power,ethnic nationalist politics in the west, subjugation of minorities but based on religion, ethnic nationalism only ever brings violence. 
t1_dsqzmak	0	*	Tldr
t1_dsr8qlg	0	*	What can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence.    It is well known what ABMs there are, it's not a secret. 
t1_dsoxhvh	0	*	Yeah - that doesnt win arguments   Im not sure who you are trying to impress   Im sad for your station in life ... its okay, someday you will pull through and get better 
t1_dsna5xo	1	*	I'm referring more to NK 
t1_dsn9pzt	0	*	Ah yes, when all else fails, default to 'trump supporter'
t1_dsjeet0	0	*	Either way, Israel accepted a peaceful resolution that would not include any territory populated by Arabs within its borders. That disproves your original claim.
t1_dv4mq5j	0	*	Examining two different search engines I am 99% convinced you are bluffing. Give us the source, if you can. 
t1_dsc9eoc	0	*	Youre not a woman, youre a bitch.
t1_duulw9x	0	*	That's okay. See one typo. Incapable of discussing the rest.
t1_duvvdod	1	*	So we all agree then? We out 
t1_duuo150	0	*	Of course now it is too late to go back because of a real population. But that will never change the fact that britain doesn't belong there.
t1_duul5e8	1	*	its your cakeday, no sorry's needed ;)
t1_duuv2il	0	*	Lol as if theyre all bots...
t1_duukzrm	1	*	couldn't have said it better myself.
t1_duvb6c6	0	*	Ok, so tell me of a time when the electors voted differently than the vote of the people they represented.    This is a disingenuous point. And again doesn't relate to the Chinese system.   
t1_duuqqvu	0	*	Are you Norwegian? 
t1_duve5a3	1	*	Good, now convince the idiots to protest things in order of importance, not in order of cuteness.
t1_duura18	0	*	Fish don't produce oxygen, they do the opposite. Killing them leaves more for us.
t1_duujzks	1	*	You don't care about being genuine.  Goodbye.
t1_duuexuq	0	*	That's what happens when you try to debate with one of the many who believe that China can do no wrong. 
t1_duukwwq	0	*	> whaling in Norway  Why do you keep mentioning Norway when most others here aren't specifically singling them out ? In my experience, Japan's the one that received the majority of whaling bashing.
t1_duuu68l	1	*	That makes no sense, the size of those boats and fleets are nothing compared to the size of the ocean. Fishing is like a drop is the ocean.
t1_duusmw7	0	*	So clever. Not only are you omnipresent, you are original too, because literally no one has ever said that to me instead of coming up with an actual response. 
t1_duuopwc	0	*	>And winner of most retarded post of 2018 is this.  That means a lot coming from you, author of this masterpiece:  >Haha as if. Moron.  
t1_dt7g89x	0	*	I wouldn't care if you called me a homo because I'm an adult. I don't get offended by every little thing I don't like
t1_du0atwn	0	*	You don't have anyone you'd save from self-destructive behavior? That explains it.
t1_du0dzt7	1	*	That's a very good point. I'll also admit that I used the children insult because this shit makes me angry. 
t1_du0iu3t	1	*	yo what sauces do you have your kebabs
t1_dshpnre	0	*	where did I say that? of course they would. It doesn't mean it's okay.
t1_dsgzuj0	0	*	No, it is not in the real world.
t1_dsh7wuj	1	*	you actually disagree that benefits are part of the salary?   who's arguing in bad faith now?
t1_dsigjc5	1	*	Settle down Ayn
t1_dshebxb	0	*	you tell me, I guess. Your post is factually incorrect.
t1_dsh4ziz	0	*	It isn't wrong. If you are living on what you are currently making then it is a living wage. 
t1_dsgxkv2	0	*	Slaves. Plenty. Replaceable.
t1_dsha4pr	0	*	Living wage doesn't have a definition. True.   It doesn't have a define number. It is just some number that website made up.  Anyone can make up some bullshit site. It is meaningless.
t1_dsgyoqb	0	*	That is a decent point. I hadn't thought about it that way before.
t1_dsjs0dk	0	*	You are being deliberately obtuse to avoid dealing with the argument that you know you cannot deal with. Have a nice night!
t1_dshn8gg	0	*	What up houstonian? 
t1_dthaq1r	0	*	Aww, at least you tried. 
t1_dsm5e3c	1	*	Fair enough, both of those are things I never wouldve even dreamed of.   Out of curiosity, well, where are you from? lol
t1_dslzbmt	0	*	Well I'm glad things got better for you, and thanks for actually engaging me without slinging shit.  
t1_dsm6qe9	1	*	Also because the answer is probably something like freedomblog.ru
t1_dsmvtv1	0	*	Now youre grasping at straws
t1_dsndxj2	0	*	You sound like the average Nazi when told you're literally the most privileged people on earth. 
t1_dsmfilf	1	*	All good I already think way less of you and people like you as a person.  Those sound like relationships I'm better off missing out on. Some people just aren't worth it at all.
t1_dslyeev	0	*	Hey now, he helped Kevin find the hotel lobby lol.
t1_dsly94h	1	*	No, not the ban liiiiist! It burrrrnssss!
t1_dsmg1ag	0	*	You are glomming on to ridiculous examples to try to prove that racism doesn't exist.  It doesn't prove that racism doesn't exist.
t1_dsm084o	1	*	Thats why immigration is smart. Let people in fear of their lives live somewhere FREE i guess youre too dense to realize that. I forgot though thats youre go to argument. 
t1_dt2oo9x	0	*	What would you have done regarding the blockade? All while keeping in mind that it was security reasons and actions on the Gazans over the years that caused it to tighten
t1_dt2rbma	0	*	No, Israel started that war. 
t1_dt5gzc9	0	*	Israel's border in the west bank that you keep trying to ignore, where is it? And you haven't pointed out anything wrong instead you just trot out straw man arguments. 
t1_due6ds1	1	*	Don't believe they have the sport. Would have to look more closely next time I see it.
t1_duex1ea	1	*	Well because they are dictatorships that dont care about capitalism at all, the government is in charge.  I dont see anything about socialism or communism or how you got that
t1_due1y7g	1	*	Portugal is bloody lovely!
t1_dudvtgn	1	*	Lmao dude 
t1_dueho5x	0	*	He skimmed the first few sentences.
t1_duealx1	1	*	This is the internet where witty responses are king! How dare thee minimize our great works here!!
t1_dudtdsy	0	*	Again, in what way is that wrong?  You haven't answered.
t1_due134c	0	*	Nonprofits rely on donations instead of investment to stay afloat. Cutting profits means no capital investment. Again, we would need a large tax increase to subsidize for health insurance. 
t1_dueeb26	1	*	Current resident. Is a shit hole. Where should i start? Just glad it's a nice place to live, but that's about it. Other than location, the rest is pure trash.
t1_dudtiqn	0	*	Except he said capitalism exists hence us asking for an example.  
t1_duehqnn	1	*	> Due to the complex history of evolving meanings and contexts, there is no clear or agreed-upon definition of the Third World  From the wiki he linked.
t1_due0wjp	1	*	I believe sk was capitalistic due to the western control/influence until fairly recently. As such, I believe they'd be classified first world
t1_dulzelm	0	*	But what they want is to treat other citizens like shit in a systematic way.

t1_dus9cye	0	*	He's not bad.  Can come off very pretentious and intellectually superior, but he has a few good ideas.  
t1_dtc52q8	0	*	That's weird I never said any of that. 
t1_dsrzvzd	0	*	Youre a weird aggressive little coward on the internet.  The irony of using this medium to call me out on being a man is laughable.
t1_dsr2fpv	0	*	Well good on you. Just don't give yourself an ulcer over all of it. It will be ok.
t1_dsqov8n	0	*	Not an argument. Try Again.
t1_dsqjl8s	0	*	Okay, so it's poverty, not their race preventing it.
t1_dsqt7bd	1	*	Political Correctness.
t1_dsqcco7	0	*	I promise that you're not interesting enough to warrant an AMA.  But regardless, mind reiterating or quoting your explaination, if I got it wrong when I paraphrased?
t1_dssxcc2	0	*	So, you're saying the deep south were progressive?    That doesn't sound right, at any point in history. :P
t1_dsq77xg	0	*	The US is very backwards in that regard. Not a good example of the world.
t1_dsqj8se	0	*	The pic you linked is a pic circulated by InfoWars that compares his clock to a Honeywell Demo Kit, but labels it actual suitcase bomb.  Do you understand?  Your meme is not proof.
t1_dsq9pfb	0	*	Great question. But I asked first. Could you answer the question please.
t1_dsqw7dh	1	*	Dude go to their site, you can just e-mail them them. If it's true, link a source that isn't conservative. Link to the bonus's from last year. You won't. 
t1_dsqb27b	0	*	And I voiced it. No one is forcing you to respond to me dude. 
t1_dsw6hpw	1	*	More or less not condemning the police or the teachers involved, and certainly not rewarding the family with compensation.
t1_ds5f50l	0	*	The prices you keep putting are your own inventions. If you are upset, you only ave yourself to blame here my friend.
t1_ds6od36	0	*	No country will allow foreign intelligence agencies to run operations in their country. On that principle alone he deserves to go to jail. 
t1_ds5ahbc	0	*	lol again equating random laws with death penalty of sharia. When you understand the difference let me know.
t1_dsy4vrr	0	*	You said they were bad. You were the one who brought up the topic of showering.  Pay attention man. Or woman. Or both. This is real life! 
t1_du1y5bi	1	*	Israel has.

t1_dt2f4my	0	*	1 in 38 US children have lead poisoning according to the CDC. This is capitalist America. 
t1_dt1vhr2	1	*	Awww, that wasn't very nice!  My message is way different from the Nazis, including those in Charlottesville.  So I don't have anything to worry about in that sense.
t1_dt21iah	1	*	Explains why children are getting diagnosed with lead poisoning in the US. 
t1_dt1i7zv	1	*	To clarify in support of your point, the root of the problem is the terrorism of Mexico and Central and South America.  I'd want nothing to do with that, too.
t1_dt1d06b	1	*	No, I meant the guy you replied to. 
t1_dt3apms	1	*	By which I mean he would have competed to win the popular vote.  His entire strategy would have changed. You don't know what the outcome would have been.
t1_dt30xq3	0	*	... do what???  You keep using that word but you don't know that it means
t1_dt1tijb	1	*	Choosing illegal immigrants over funding the government is treason. Please stop defending this.
t1_dt1yn62	1	*	Lets say I'm from China then. Also lets say I'm from Russia then. Show me how it would be different 
t1_dt1sl91	1	*	Ironic comment 
t1_dt3ngpc	0	*	you should stop lying about what happened. the people organically revolted against their govts in the arab spring. to spin it as foreign meddling is ignorant
t1_dt3nqil	0	*	A third option does exist. It's the one where I don't give two blue fucks about his company's position and am trying to explain basic accounting to you.  
t1_dt1bsuh	1	*	>capitalist ruling party  Lol
t1_dt1qord	0	*	Dude, it's okay to be a virgin, you don't have to pretend. Just don't get so angry about it.
t1_dsz7mba	0	*	Israel doesn't have greater rights than Palestinians. Doubly so on Palestinian land. Palestinians predate the invention of israel in 1948
t1_duh80yx	0	*	Just because it was brought up in the indictment doesnt mean I was referring to the indictment. We knew about Russian Astro-turfing long ago. Its common knowledge. 
t1_dzanju4	0	*	Everyone that voted for obama ended up a loser so I guess I am part of that.
t1_duhml0h	0	*	Oh okay. Provide me with some insight into that.

t1_dtqe467	1	*	Now back to sniffing glue
t1_duilvr9	0	*	Does not matter if grey or white. Thor died in 2007 so he is now ashes. Come to think of it ash is grey.  Nevermind. 
t1_duifwwq	0	*	Whatever dude.  Extrapolating past climate via proxies is worthless.  So many unknown variables unaccounted for along with massive uncertainty ranges makes any conclusions nothing more than guesses.  
t1_dujauy2	1	*	Right. I'd bet on a complete splintering of the military in Civil War fashion. But a lot messier. Would it come down to states vs federal again? Or just complete mayhem?
t1_duhoxab	0	*	Apparently in Europe they arent taught that nuclear deterrence kept the red army from marching to the Atlantic instead of settling for Germany.
t1_duhuq2r	0	*	Maybe if I trusted them, but I don't.
t1_dtef8gh	1	*	 >I**'ve** **got** better grammar than yours.  How irony. 
t1_dtc9u4i	0	*	Here is the reasoning: The Dalai Lama lived in his palace, and the palace was well documented to have slaves. Also, the non monk class of Tibetians were all serfs, so glorified slaves. 
t1_dtc87nd	0	*	UN Resolution 2758 (25 October 1971) states that there is only one China represented by the PRC. If you want to argue against the UN, then be my guest.
t1_du2hdkg	1	*	So china dog got anything else to say? You think everyone here is living in US so they don't know what kind of shit the communist is doing?   
t1_du1ns2d	0	*	Actually, scratch that.  I'm gonna go with both naive AND willfully ignorant. Congrats, bud, you got the twofer. 
t1_du1d2ed	1	*	Ahh, I see. I dont know much about these things, so thanks for explaining to me.

t1_dt3bo8u	0	*	Based on citizenship.  We call that every country on the planet.  Show me Israel having different laws for Israeli Arabs and we'll have something to talk about.
t1_dszx7va	0	*	Sounds like Canada is a good country to kidnap and ransom rich people to me, what with the lack of security systems. 
t1_dszwqdt	1	*	Like i said. He was making enemies. Even without hindsight more precautions should have been taken.
t1_dszyutq	0	*	Wouldn't call myself pro-Shkreli, don't really follow the guy. I've just seen a lot of people, him included, saying what I said without anyone disproving it.
t1_dt0o4zw	0	*	Sure, but how much of that value is the raw materials and labour, and how much is the location? 
t1_dt07eg2	1	*	And common sense says that they would be paid more by continuing an investigation rather than ending one. This is really quite simple. 
t1_dszz8pv	1	*	That and then you have professional burglars.
t1_dt5ngg8	0	*	Hey listen I really appreciate it. 
t1_dt038kf	0	*	Noveau riche where companies are too big to fail... I had to Google Noveau riche, and I don't think it fits. Did you use that term to sound smart, have you ever used it before today? 
t1_dszzonj	1	*	I'm 7 and I'm listening to this from the future on youtube.
t1_dt019bu	1	*	USian? Don't be an asshole. 
t1_dt00hdp	0	*	Not a huge fan of it either, but doing nothing is even less acceptable. You mentioned something that would hurt the rich and powerful? Because I'm up for that instead provided it exists.
t1_dt05eh5	1	*	Hollar back 
t1_dt0ku86	1	*	Bitcoin, me and my wife are early adopters 
t1_dt007b6	0	*	What part of my comment was I denying life to people? I'm denying your claim to steal someone elses wealth and work. The rich don't deny life to people, they take advantage of opportunities 
t1_dtna2ba	0	*	reported me? hahahaha. omg. 
t1_dtnrr0c	0	*	I was watching Space Ghost Coast to Coast and smoking, take your Thorazine
t1_dtn8clh	0	*	yeah, just seemed like an odd turn considering how far down the medical path we had gone. 
t1_dtnroqn	0	*	Idgaf, I didnt get one this year either because I don't come into contact with kids or old people. I just think its hilarious how unstable you are
t1_dtnruln	0	*	Dude, I was replying to a response you made to me. Do you actually believe what you're saying, or are you trolling?
t1_dupuau5	0	*	It means we take the hits, live with the damage, repair as best you can and move on.  Say, next and go have a life.
t1_dupuodk	0	*	Children are innocent and anyone that would take advantage of that for sexual gratification should not be allowed to engage in sexual activities ever again.  
t1_dt3ek85	0	*	OK, well I said there is zero evidence because I haven't seen it.  I might be misinformed.  Can you point me to it?
t1_dt4dtxf	0	*	After last night's game...maybe not haha, but the Raptors look sick! 
t1_dt4wjqm	0	*	So if I'm on my back porch divebombing massive spliffs, and you're my neighbor, and reefer is legal, then what?
t1_dtctidk	0	*	I mean, they were  closer to socialism than modern European countries, that's for sure.

t1_ds8eflp	0	*	Yes, 100% not having better living standard compare to Canada
t1_dsc0mf7	1	*	There would most likely be a guaranteed income or robotic production tax implemented before apocalyptic situations.   But its funny to watch everyone go to worst case the world is ending scenarios. 
t1_ds9ev2x	1	*	Where did I say they didn't work hard? 
t1_dtiqalr	0	*	It's definitely possible but my money is on my friend not having a lighter and a drunk thinking he did and then shoving him to the ground
t1_dtdwpsz	0	*	It didn't require anything. The deal is non-binding. Are you stupid or what?
t1_dtd6gg6	0	*	In political matters.    I'm not sure what you're not understanding about this. 
t1_dtdhfq7	0	*	I work around this stuff every day and can say, without a doubt, that careless action can and will get you put in jail.
t1_dtd57yg	1	*	Oh, did a Christian kill millions of people during the crusades?  Your shit is weak, man. I'm not about to try to argue with your illiterate clown ass.
t1_dtdxi5x	1	*	The holocaust, the arminiean genocide, the native americans, the slave trade, China, India, African coloninalism. You really fucking suck at history don't you?
t1_dteah48	0	*	Plenty, youre just not capable of hearing it.   Peace.
t1_dtdtfdn	1	*	Obvious troll. Lol at the username
t1_dtgoeh6	0	*	OK. I'm saying that the magnitude of natural temperatures in the era of human industrialization is tiny compared to the amount caused by humans. How can I explain this more simply? 
t1_dtki2gt	1	*	As a torch is not diminished though it kindles a million candles, so will he not lose who gives to a good cause.
t1_dtd0ac1	0	*	And you just posted a webcomic as a rebuttal.   Ive seen everything I need to from you, thanks. 
t1_dtddnru	0	*	Pleading helplessness for the most powerful man in the free world. Ladies and gentlemen, the Democrats.
t1_dsr19ly	1	*	It feels like you're trying to debate someone who hasn't even stated a position.  >My dick is perfectly fine, as nature intended and my parents ensured.   Good for you. 
t1_dstt55f	0	*	It only looks different to you because circumsicion is widespread in your country. In other countries where it is not the custom it isn't different. Also it isn't creepy if it's the norm
t1_dsr4052	1	*	Wtf are these dick infections?!
t1_dsqymvg	0	*	Then its a good thing youre circumcised in a 3rd world country. You sound like a textbook example of biblical era circumcision.
t1_duq1uy9	1	*	Lol
t1_dt8uglr	1	*	Yeah youre right. Their chemistry degree is shit, I barely even use it.
t1_dt8udxt	0	*	Yes, Oxford offers humanities degrees. What a scandal! They are just as demanding. Just because you dont personally value that subject, it doesnt mean you can write it off entirely.
t1_dufhu2u	1	*	Hope always brings comfort to the hopeful!   ....even false hope.
t1_duibsai	0	*	No, sir. You are the one with the ludicrous thought process. To think anyone should hoard money like some dragon under a mountain because capitalism is ludicrous. 
t1_duio7hl	1	*	If you can intentionally say things that cause people to act against their own best interests then youre probably tricking them. Even if its by hiding things behind existing bias, prejudice or views.
t1_duipq7b	0	*	You reject the idea of combatting wealth inequality or a distribution of wealth, no? 
t1_duijg8q	1	*	Ahh it sounded like you were arguing with me so I was confused 
t1_duixn3c	1	*	I think those guys are seriously underpaid for the risky job they are doing.
t1_duimwl8	1	*	You're correct. I have a hard time keeping up to people who have no coherent point to make. 
t1_duib73c	0	*	It would likely be votes per population unit, otherwise you're still giving a collection of 10 micro states the same voting power as India and China combined.
t1_duie9pf	1	*	If you bring your tape receipt to the landlord once he recovers from those wounds you can probably write it off on your taxes!
t1_duigo0a	0	*	So that's a yes. Have a nice day, I will give you the last word if you feel you need it.
t1_duihyg2	1	*	Never said that.   But youre naive if you think the police exist to help poor people equally compared to the wealthy. Who has more things to lose and who requires protection? Wealthy people. 
t1_dujuklk	0	*	$30k is a mountain of debt? For four years of college and an increased lifetime total earning potential in the hundreds of thousands? Call me crazy, but that's a deal I would take. 
t1_duj8ad7	1	*	>Owning is not taxable. Gaining is taxable.  Okay.... and what exactly would you call an income? Owning or gaining? Hmmm?? 
t1_duibv6t	0	*	You never said top what. Its definitely in the top half. Or do you not what what top and bottom halves are?
t1_duibkcx	0	*	The people getting the better start are the ones who think they are owed something. They never worked for that money and think it shouldent be touched. 
t1_duifr5y	0	*	I mean communism is a bad idea. But communism isnt somehow they only alternative to capitalism.
t1_duiju49	0	*	You're not quoting bill gates. You're quoting a reporter. 
t1_duijs8a	0	*	The fact that you seriously believe he's not been acting like a childish dictator tells all.  Everybody should note they didn't refute the bot claim, just the sucking dick claim.
t1_duk3bwb	1	*	Have you ever lived under communist regime? I did. You have no fucking idea.
t1_duivgeu	0	*	Southern Northern Michigan.

t1_ds6ubvf	0	*	From the article  one new owner was nice enough to give me some time in his new Model 3.
t1_dslpxbp	1	*	Im not sure what that proves. Is it really your argument that Hamas doesnt want to kill Jews? That they are lying about it? See: rockets launched at Israel regularly.
t1_dtzuai0	0	*	not as sad as the lowlife that calls a jewish child that was send to a death camp and did forced labor there a Nazi collaborateur.
t1_dtxral9	0	*	Well it's not really a threat to our society. Not now at least. If it becomes a threat then yeah, i'll be worried.
t1_dsb8s7b	0	*	So the argument is that in the places where lots of money is spent, the kids who take the test do better.  ...and the rest of the students still fail miserably.

t1_dun3l7k	0	*	While I do consider myself an independent with slightly right leaning views.  I've never even been to Breitbart or daily caller. Their reputation is exactly like BuzzFeed's, worthless. 
t1_dune1j7	1	*	Last words: I said you were a troll before you posted the video.  Maybe I should only give you a 3/10.  You really need to do better with following along.
t1_dun6n07	0	*	Bullshit.

t1_dtsxx2v	0	*	did you seriously just try to copy/paste his comment but replace a few words?  That's the same method Trump retards try to use to defend themselves. Are you sure that's a sound tactic to use? 
t1_dtsyu9n	0	*	Incorrect. What I said was correct.
t1_dtsxpwx	0	*	except I'm not the one saying we need to change our government  you are really bad at this 
t1_dtt8z51	0	*	The internet is no different to general public life. Your porn viewing habits are already recorded. Your bank account records your buying habits, is that also a bad thing? A slippery slope to what?
t1_dtst2uk	0	*	>claims to hate Nazis  >Doesn't believe in democracy  lol okay you're obviously a Russian troll trying to stir shit up. Have a nice life dear 
t1_dtt4ztm	0	*	We're talking about a man that was pretending to be a Nazi as a joke.
t1_dttfwsi	0	*	We'll have to disagree there when it comes to Nazis. It's pretty darn black and white.

t1_dt86f1w	1	*	So likely that you're going to accuse me of being a Russian troll and actually believe? Please provide any proof for anything of what you say. 
t1_dsagew6	0	*	Blind anything is bad. But you know for example you won't get legal pot with the republican party and the democratic party won't make abortions illegal. It's not a blind affiliation.
t1_dsc7d8u	1	*	> I feel really sorry for you because all you know is hate and name calling  You just brought up fox news, you're a cliche.

t1_dsigebg	0	*	I mean that perfectly represents reddit's view of North Korea. 
t1_dt3w0k4	0	*	*rolls eyes*  Cheeto? Why are you making fun of a persons skin tone? Can I call Obama a light dog turd? On second thought. I'm not still in high school so I wouldn't do that.
t1_dt3567s	0	*	Because waving his hands in the air is the same as doing the Carlos Mencia DEEDEEDERR. look with your eyes man not your heart
t1_dt4yfkv	0	*	Why are you intentially lying? I don't think you know what an ad hominem is. I referred to no one specifically. So no, its not. You're deflecting.
t1_dt3zbwq	1	*	Right and they constantly not only take things out of context, but play insane mental gymnastics to call anything a republican does a lie, and they do the same to make democratic statements true. 
t1_dt34jwx	0	*	Right on. I have a ton of free time (back in school on the GI Bill), so hit me up whenever.
t1_dt3i80d	0	*	I litterally just told you one in that comment. The voter fraud. And I didn't keep looking I'm sure there's plenty more politifact is the worst. 
t1_dt2xwuu	0	*	Your hope is to silence others without ever backing up your claims.... ok. Typical of your type.

t1_du1ub8q	1	*	uh....my bad, Vlad? XD
t1_du1u37a	0	*	I mean, you can see above what happened when I attempted to illuminate it for him. Some people are able to take it in, recognize it and move on. 
t1_du1nplg	0	*	So you believe literally everywhere Pence goes and everything he does is worthy of protest? 
t1_du213uz	1	*	I bet.

t1_ductktq	1	*	K, gonna go ahead and put you on ignore, not interested in arguing with contrarians.
t1_du7l6d7	1	*	Explain what you think this means. My understanding is that once someone is in Sweden, it is entirely a matter for Sweden to decide to extradite someone or not.
t1_du7551c	0	*	So if they're not desparate to get him why would they waste energy or resources on lifting him from the UK without going through legal extradition processes?
t1_du7a1kk	0	*	> you're just blatantly making shit up  Did you or did you not say this?
t1_du74daz	1	*	Also he skipped bail. Which is also illegal.
t1_dsvtubl	0	*	which is why i asked, what evidence would it take?
t1_dtzm0gp	0	*	I went to the section you cited.  The website clearly has an agenda as you'd know if you bothered to look through it, don't cite this piece of shit to me again.
t1_du039af	1	*	We've tried Separate But Equal before.  We got rid of it because guess what, it's not actual equality of any sort.
t1_dsldx4a	0	*	I do try my best, thanks! :) you can actually look up what I've written though, just so that it reinforces your accusing me of being nuts.
t1_dsa4q7u	0	*	They did, they offered accommodation. That is responsible
t1_dsllqzj	1	*	> You made an unsupported claim.  I gave my opinion and you mistook it for a claim because you lack critical reading comprehension. 
t1_dt1zb7l	1	*	Not like i described which is the problem i'm trying to convey and why people have a problem understanding evolution.
t1_dtq2dnr	0	*	That's new to me. I never knew you slav macedonians believe that they are more greek than greek themselves. I always thought they were trying to make macedonia slavic.
t1_dss84rt	0	*	I'm a Giants fan, that's as high as I could reach this season.
t1_dtc3e5f	0	*	IU'm pretty sure I'm talking with a bot at this point. Tell your programmer you need more work, you're outputting nonsense.
t1_dv37lup	1	*	Really???        Calling white supremacists good people would already be an indication for that.    But you just showed that you are one as well. Nice talk, have a great day.
t1_dt386ns	0	*	Sure is, its almost like the right wing has it out for them. 
t1_dtnler0	1	*	You defend the rape of men because you are probably a rapist yourself. I'm sure you are the feminist pedo who thinks that raping 12 year old boys is okay. Get out, rapist
t1_dt1lz70	0	*	Really? Cause polls are just sample statistics. A lot of them are done on purpose in areas they know will increase a certain candidates favor because it helps to create a herd mentality for votes. 
t1_dt7q94g	0	*	I'm honestly really surprised that its only 10% renewable energy in Netherlands, whenever I visit it seems like nothing but wind turbines everywhere. 
t1_dt7a5mm	0	*	What psychology?  Of course it can be scaled up.  It would take a 500 MWh battery to get 5000 mile range.  That would be  an $80,000,000 battery today. 1/20 the price of your nuclear submarine.

t1_dut8ihc	0	*	You've been reading to much anti China propaganda. I'd say Americans are just as brainwashed as Chinese nationals. Maybe even more so as American propaganda is superior.
t1_dut5v1h	0	*	You're just a boring asshole.
t1_dutnw2d	0	*	The military could stay neutral. Its not an either/or question.
t1_duu0z8p	1	*	thats very different from mowing down thousands of rightfully pissed off countrymen.
t1_dut9t2g	0	*	Well, that one is working out. British life expectancy is better than American (81 years vs 79). Also, private healthcare still exists in the UK, so you have the two options as opposed to just one.  
t1_duu6xd7	0	*	Both Taiwanese and Chinese refer to him as father of the country.  But sure man, you clearly know better than the billion plus chinese people about what they think. 
t1_dut5i16	0	*	No worries bro, its lonely up here at the top as the worlds last superpower. 
t1_dutpis7	0	*	Well that's not gonna happen is not a counter argument.
t1_dutbzap	1	*	>Well, the death count matches the secondary source of *supposedly* internal Chinese estimates.  When you have the preface your sources with secret and supposedly, they aren't good sources.
t1_dut6k7a	1	*	He really wants to be proud of his country, but there isn't all the much to be proud of. So out of frustration and envy he lashes out at the big guy.

t1_dskbzl3	0	*	Don't worry your loss of fake internet points aren't coming from me. 
t1_dskbqa4	1	*	As if ANTIFA and white supremacists are those extremes. They are small fringe groups with no real impact on policy. The real extremes are the one making decisions. 
t1_dsl1w8j	1	*	Show me where I did that?
t1_ds3zfqn	1	*	Unfortunately that seems to be the case. 'All climate scientists are biased, except the ones that tell me what I want to hear.'
t1_ds43h4r	1	*	After you.... lol
t1_dts0z5j	0	*	Actuality yes, its better.  And no, he wasnt some kind of a whistleblower. He was merely killed while they tried to get to the money. I just wish Browder was there instead of Magnitsky.
t1_dte6yqv	1	*	Others have already done so, and you've stubbornly and incorrectly insisted you were right. So why waste any more time on you?
t1_dtbzepq	1	*	So you agree that traumatic events desensitize (normalize) people to traumatic events?
t1_dtcdmuc	0	*	...you are really clutching at straws now.  Got any other juvenile assessments of complex geopolitical affairs?  
t1_dtcfwm0	0	*	Because there were other better targets that the Nazis couldve went after. 
t1_dtc54sa	0	*	Your bigger point may be true. But it also means that rather than fight evil, you just allow it to be. 
t1_dtcqfcm	0	*	I count 5 deaths and 20 wounded.... this is a fact. But sure lets squabble over blind statistics when any deaths are too many when they could be avioded... proof? Look at Australia...
t1_dtc0tg1	1	*	Yes you already posted that. I'm saying that saying the only qualification for not being killed was being atheist is completely false. 
t1_dtctva3	1	*	Maybe you should have spent more time arguing about that and not the straw man you created. Bye!
t1_dumyxle	0	*	because of water? I knew I shouldn't have drunk that nazi shit.

t1_dtzgqaw	0	*	Hierarchical appreciation? You mean like acknowledging the fact that hierarchies of competence exist and serve a function in society?
t1_dtz3hz7	1	*	That scenario didn't happen so that's a dumb argument. Try again
t1_dtzbjgf	0	*	Better experience is entirely subjective. I'm personally very happy that I'm paying a lot less for a much better experience than I'd ever get with an iPhone. 
t1_dtze6hv	0	*	Woah, take it easy. Im just saying they dont have a problem with x-Americans. The people you described arent American citizens, but whatever, do your thing. Didnt mean to get you lit up. 
t1_du0myfs	0	*	So could you explain why the Lindsey Shepard case, where a university disciplined a TA, done through the university's own code of conduct, is proof that the government legislated pronouns?
t1_du0mvd6	0	*	But budgets don't balance themselves. Governments balance budgets. that is why it is called budgeting. 
t1_dtz0b42	1	*	This is what it looks like when a T_D poster self-identifies.

t1_dtj7a34	0	*	Why would I? No normal human being has those values. Anyone who does.. well I dont feel bad if their career is ruined. Theyd be a hypocrite and shouldnt be rewarded for that 
t1_dtqz0x7	0	*	All I've asked for is a place in the memo where it specifically debunks a section of the dossier. You can't provide it because it doesn't exist and Nunes knows it doesn't exist.

t1_dtow0n4	0	*	No you just were vague and use horrible sentence structure. 
t1_dtojm6h	1	*	Gotcha bud.
t1_due2n2n	0	*	One thing. I thought the dude was kkk which is different than the alt right.   Isn't alt right just a more radical group of conservatives while the kkk is purely racist?   I could be totally wrong

t1_dtdth64	0	*	Chavez didn't take control until 99.
t1_dt7nfvu	0	*	That wiki article mentions 1 outlet shutdown - Kavkaz Center. Waiting for other 99 examples.

t1_dtv7gqy	0	*	According to the Swedish Director of Prosecutions there it can't until he surrenders himself to Sweden and goes there for questioning. The law is different from the US.
t1_dtudkrk	1	*	I can see why they would be upset.  That doesn't mean our anger over their (IMO far more widespread and successful) meddling isn't valid.   
t1_dseykcx	0	*	Your own link shows a UN ratio difference of around 10 percent. 60 vs 70. And I repeat. Hamas is not all of Palestine.   And that's quoting the huge casualties involved.
t1_dssp6cp	1	*	I see it as the next wave of monetary expansion. It's like quantitative easing but regular folks can benefit too. 
t1_dtf6ero	0	*	Me and several other people have fully explained the point you just dont/refuse to get it.
t1_dsl5cn8	0	*	So, supported a coup and forced Haiti to open its markets to the world, according to your source.  Beneficial or not, that looks like the opposite of an embargo. 
t1_dv3vrx5	0	*	That's not a source I think you put the wrong link not once does that say money from the foundation went tk the campaign
t1_dv3bj35	0	*	Things are different on the internet... Feed the trolls if you must but engaging them only puts gas on the dumpsterfire. Don't you have better shit to do than keyboard warrior?

t1_dv2iknf	0	*	Again, for every bad police shooting of a black man, you have one for a white man too, and it still doesn't proclude any person from their 2nd amendment rights. 
t1_dv2u7qc	0	*	Critiquing America's two-party system is a vastly different and vastly more sensible thing than to criticize its constituents. Maybe do more of the former and less of the latter. 
t1_dujqocv	0	*	It's all forms of manipulation. 
t1_dujt1iv	0	*	Muh proof. You're a poor troll. I just mentioned a developing story about another thing the Mueller Probe made public connecting Trump and Russia.
t1_dujywpx	0	*	Yeah, I'm graduating this year. Can't wait to grow up and be as smart as you.
t1_dukawp2	1	*	Well I guess were being pedantic now. 
t1_duk12h3	0	*	Yes, by pointing out other situations which I have argued are not comparable. 
t1_dujnw8x	0	*	I definitely don't believe your interpretation of the tweet. You thought that me saying that's not impossible meant that must not be what he meant
t1_dukhx6c	0	*	Yes.
t1_duk8jha	0	*	I don't know, I feel like if we modeled after the systems that DO work (like with the European and Canadian examples), we could have some success.

t1_dujwrgq	1	*	so, to be fair we should add a few Democrats to the current all Republican investigation team?

t1_dujx48a	0	*	Bonzai77 why are all terrorist shooters democrats?
t1_dukdux0	1	*	I'm not sure what you are talking about, sorry man. The original poster said red states are less educated statistically, nothing else.

t1_dtj2lcf	0	*	Ok, I'll have to specify its general anesthetic. I already specified major surgery, which should have been enough I thought but... 
t1_dtj4hrp	0	*	Oh, would you prefer the crazy guy to be the surgeon and surgically amputate the person's arm? What does it change? 
t1_dtk1wlo	0	*	Yes my uncut cock.
t1_dt5qra0	1	*	Because they clearly can't take care of themselves.  That's cool, I believe that as well. I'm still being charged for the water I consume though, so I don't really see your point.
t1_dt174uh	0	*	Why not? It's not like it's physically difficult to throw salt on snails, is it? There's a bit of a trick to it, a little twist of the wrist, a click of the tongue, you'll have it in no time.

t1_du1yenb	0	*	Or I would just like the US to fix our own human rights abuses before trying to act like we are morally superior.
t1_dszfi8x	1	*	Considering it has more than 4 times the population of the next biggest country, being only the 7th largest is absolutely pathetic.
t1_du8l8fy	0	*	You missed the point completely. In your opinion it is, but that doesn't mean that they're lying 100% of the time.   
t1_dua39zo	0	*	Thats up to interpretation. You did not admit the statistic could be completely fabricated until right now.
t1_dua0rar	0	*	i totally agree

t1_dv1ebyq	1	*	Yes but other than Gladiator fights, building London, metalworks, fancy pots and a wall, *what* did the Romans ever do for you?
t1_dv0xis5	0	*	The night is darkest before the dawn. The question is can we get any darker? I fear the DNC has yet to learn from its mistakes and will continue to push establishment neo-liberalism. 
t1_dv15o0r	1	*	I mean, I agree? You basically just paraphrased my above comment. Gah, arming teachers...what a goddamn dumb idea! I can't believe Trump is a real person, let alone a president!
t1_dv2p5py	1	*	The group of people I know vary in age between 19 - 64 if it matters.  If you'd like to see my other arguments on why the EU is undemocratic, dig a bit further in my comments as I make my case there.
t1_dv2gyg5	1	*	Its greatly the same in Europe. People dont realize the intellectual property rights exist world wide. Otherwise a lot of people simply wouldnt make new things. 
t1_dv1gxnn	1	*	Europe has 2.3x the population of America.
t1_dv1mwbx	0	*	Also FYI your wrong and Im right. We spread them across Europe and they were still very much wild and boar 
t1_dv1sf14	0	*	Ah.
t1_dv13sb3	0	*	I gave an example before about how a dutch referendum on accepting the EU constitution got overruled. There are more similar cases in other countries but as a dutch citizen that one stuck with me.

t1_dv0ysnm	0	*	No, they are not accidental discharges, I filtered those out by category.  Again, I asked you a very simple question: What definition of school shooting are you using to brush away the stats?
t1_dv1niw2	0	*	You presented your opinions as facts. Look at the way you phrased things.

t1_ds4oekz	1	*	Naw, your argument is I say you're a hypocrite so you are, and you're defending dick jokes from our president. It's obvious you're either a child or as dimwitted as Trump himself.

t1_dtzmew3	0	*	It's not. You do not source statements that are *plainly obvious*. You source statements that are *controversial or questionable*. Cruel farming practices is normal is in no way plainly obvious.

t1_du039eg	0	*	In the case of eating meat there is no one else to be concerned for. Ask a pig if it cares about being made into bacon, if you get an intelligent response I will contemplate no longer eating bacon.
t1_du00nmv	1	*	I dont care because as I said, while animal suffering is wrong, killing animals is not. If something is not wrong, why should I care if someone needs to do it or not? It should be allowed either way.
t1_du8h66f	1	*	Yea sure

t1_dtn7glv	1	*	come visit me in the abandoned house in the woods sometime  just for a little while... yes...
t1_dtnt1xq	1	*	Right, cool. 
t1_dtpab89	1	*	You're missing my point, I never said anything about what you said about Jews, it's your entire overarching attitude and tone in this thread.
t1_duyqiyw	0	*	Oh it's cute seeing you so defeated...
t1_dtb3aq9	1	*	It's not gay so long as you say no homo
t1_dtbox9d	0	*	The fuck you talking about?  The electoral college is the reason he won, if he had taken the majority the vote might have been pissed away.  It was not. Now kindly fuck off
t1_dtb2gip	1	*	No we cut up a few things and give it to them on a plate.
t1_dtb0ng5	0	*	So typical. That's exactly what I'd figure she'd do. So annoying. 
t1_dtcv74l	1	*	Low effort reply. Please try again. 
t1_dtn1szi	1	*	You could have saved me typing something that is pretty much common knowledge by googling it yourself. 
t1_dt8cdnt	0	*	Apologies for the length of that, I guess I do get passionate.  :)
t1_dtbl2bm	0	*	Yeah, people who are wrong generally want to stop talking when they run out of arguments.
t1_dtb49vh	1	*	Semantics then I suppose. I don't see cryptokitties as cryptocurrency. But perhaps there are those that do. It is surely a new world. And we are far off topic at this point.
t1_dte5agq	0	*	Normally I would say RTFA, but in this case it looks like you didn't even read the title.
t1_dup88bq	0	*	As with any group whose name starts with Islamic,  my expectations were low.
t1_dsz5smn	0	*	>Safer than a Chicago ghetto perhaps but not most of the US.  I'm confused.... what are you saying here?
t1_dsz1q3m	0	*	Doesn't really look like you were just pointing out a problem you noticed.   Somebody said the USA has the highest infant mortality rate and you replied only if you aren't white. Seems like a cop out.
t1_dszfz4s	0	*	Not judging, and I know there are shades of grey.  
t1_dsz5n85	0	*	No doubt.  
t1_dszo68g	1	*	dude i have no idea what you think youre trying to argue, but it has nothing to do with what im talking about. 
t1_dszj7md	1	*	You brought up ethnicity, not him.
t1_dszb4n0	0	*	It doesn't change the fact that you spend more on healthcare than military.     Gotta love Murican mental acrobatics.     INB4 But if you don't count black people then it's.... 
t1_dszk5n7	0	*	You can be broke after visiting the doctor in Canada. Pills aint cheap 
t1_dt0hhhd	0	*	Youre American, whether you like it or not. Seems like not from your above comments though... Poor you. 
t1_dsz62qf	1	*	You beat them, you called them a weirdo. Well done
t1_dszbeqx	0	*	> You seem quite content with profiting over treatment.  I support both. I would like the US to still lead in innovations, so the world can have access to those.
t1_dt05860	0	*	Yes they do. Fictious. 
t1_dt0h4h8	1	*	There was also supposedly a lot of tech in the FXX directly from the F1 team, and Ferrari didn't want them out in the world where a competitor could potentially reverse engineer the car.
t1_dsz4rei	0	*	a.k.a. much better country 
t1_dt0jd3x	0	*	>  such an obvious use of exaggeration  If your point is SO FUCKING AMAZING, why can't you just say what you mean?
t1_dszbdjd	0	*	> every time public school comes up in conversation?  If people call it free, sure.
t1_dtr4j68	1	*	That doesn't defeat the fact that they come for an education then leave. That's just a reason for it.
t1_ds48x0f	1	*	Also, please remind me, when was the West Bank theirs. It was Jordanian, British, ottoman, but never Palestinian. Jordan attacked Israel, Jordan lost. Thats it.
t1_ds48rcy	1	*	Sure sure. Oppressed my ass. You start what you call a genocidal war and you lose. Now its up to you to negotiate peace. As long as you choose genocide, youll be oppressed. Choose otherwise. For once.
t1_dtsod4q	0	*	Most people are capable of changing their mind if their perspective changes. Even if you can only shift 5 or 10% its way more productive than hurling insults that only make you feel vindicated. 
t1_duxofc1	0	*	> Yeah, and by dossier, I was referring to the entire Trump-Russia dossier.  What Trump-Russia dossier are you referring to? Google only had the other one.
t1_dsin49j	0	*	Tough for you it seems.
t1_dsimoc8	0	*	Since you're clearly out to demonize the US for every little thing tell me this, what country in the world has ever saved another country?  EDIT: not actually an edit because I can proofread.
t1_dsig1uv	0	*	Yaaawn.  It's like you're reading from a script.  Your ad hominem nonsense is worthless.  Just because you don't like it doesn't mean it isn't valid.
t1_dskbv6k	0	*	Since you clearly didn't glean that easily spelled out information already if I had stopped you probably would have not understood it again. 
t1_dsj92ks	0	*	Wages are pretty much the same increase...labor force participation about the same. Slight improvement in unemployment.   But the stock market...has gone up more. 
t1_dsi7sm8	0	*	Naw, it's your estrogen I'm pretty sure. 
t1_dt8v0vs	0	*	The point is for you to name a good thing Trump has done that hasn't been reported by the MSM. But you literally cannot name a single one to back up your point.   How do you not understand that?
t1_dt96y66	0	*	Look everyone, another stable genius!  Lock up your daughters and your pornstars that look like your daughters!
t1_dt901ah	0	*	That is one of the stupidest arguments I've ever heard. If you think that's what is going on in America you are a fucking idiot.
t1_dt8uzbc	0	*	Because hes an idiot who says ignorant shit. 
t1_dt98b6p	1	*	No, I was definitely thinking Jimi. For some reason I could have sworn he had dreads at some point. My mistake!
t1_dta9adb	0	*	The fuck does this have to do with anything? 
t1_dt92434	0	*	No but if after every single anonymous sources story about a certain subject end up to be bunk, I think it's prudent to be wary of any anonymous sources story about that subject 
t1_dt9nqel	0	*	and if you think a large public gathering is the same as an actual street protest then it only confirm my point. Of course police don't beat  people at music shows, i'm talking about real ones
t1_dtasa4j	0	*	Citation required proving a business that *he* runs that has not failed.
t1_dta1i7c	1	*	You type like an absolute knob lmao. Sad little man. :)
t1_dt9hn22	0	*	I don't agree with what Trump is doing either. Its another case of Trump's narcissism getting the best of him. I only responded to your comment because it seemed hypocritical to me.
t1_dt961x1	0	*	Wow you know what that's it I'm sucking your dick
t1_dtbmwdy	1	*	You still don't know what a strawman is.
t1_dt99a67	1	*	There's listed accounts of what happened disprove those accounts
t1_dt8uxan	0	*	If top officials are verifying something she said then sure I believe her. Especially when the integrity of the institution is on the line if they didnt properly vet her. 
t1_dt95f04	0	*	Pretty refreshing stuff lol. Enjoy life man, politics is politics, but we're both still people.
t1_dtwyb4l	1	*	Ethics don't end at the letter of the law.  I was clearly not speaking on their legal authority.  Get your head out of your ass.
t1_dtx6n8s	0	*	So I take it you're Norwegian. Which part of Norway are you from?
t1_dtyuvfd	0	*	You must be osmium...
t1_du0xf8x	0	*	Explain how you think this is any different than any other investment?
t1_ducro9h	1	*	I hope them in the same regard because despite their mediums and audience sizes, they both claim to be news networks and should both be held to similar (if not the same) standards. 
t1_duebdge	0	*	Explain what? You think I haven't heard the story?
t1_dudrb3q	1	*	then maybe you need to do your research. But hey its only the main conflict of our current time period, why would you be interested in that. 
t1_dudofdc	0	*	The future of America....the American millennial in its glory and natural habitat...Reddit. Don't stare at it too long or it will toss its own feces at you.
t1_ducx1q0	0	*	So you are a Trump supporter then. Probably should have realized that sooner. Clearly there is no point in continuing this, then. Your cognitive dissonance will last until the bitter end. 
t1_dud0rha	0	*	Thanks for proving my point. :)
t1_dud6jnb	0	*	You're just self righteous. I promise you this website isn't the only place you're a tough person to talk to...
t1_ds24ykq	0	*	A one state solution will never happen. They know that will mean another jewish genocide.  
t1_dt0rky0	1	*	Probably because it would be harder to establish a baseline and keep track in the island countries before modern communication..
t1_dt1394l	1	*	The point was obviously that they'd control the middle east (or parts of it) if they could. And a better example of Crimea already exists: Syria.
t1_dt0k90e	0	*	Why dont you go look at the positives, and then come back to me? Because you are only presenting one side of the coin.
t1_dt1biit	0	*	Can a hunter let a kid shoot a rifle? Sure. But if someone sees and reports it the hunter will probably lose the gun license and pay a heavy fine. 
t1_dt0k4pe	0	*	> due to membership of Hizb ut-Tahrir  you realize nearly everyone you've cited was killed for being an Islamist?  they deserved everything that came to them.
t1_dt0onu5	1	*	Please read up on majority governments. We do not have one right now, and to that end they are unelected.
t1_dt121co	0	*	And now the Islamists are in power, and people are being sold in open markets into literal slavery. Much preferred.
t1_dt11nkb	1	*	This is the most peaceful humans have ever been. All things come to an end.
t1_dt0xc17	0	*	Uhhh the Napoleonic wars maybe?   Edit: That's only one example, I've got many more. Europe has only been free of large scale conflict for the past 84 years or so. 
t1_dt14trc	0	*	Guantanamo?
t1_dt0nx83	0	*	Explain the 12 MPs that form our government that stood for a party the populous didnt vote for.
t1_dt0k0fy	0	*	dictatorships do not have to be iron fisted.     
t1_dt39yze	1	*	Yeah I meant airstrips they could use but thatd mean roads and bases too. Maybe not feasible for KSA to accomplish. 
t1_duqfj2y	1	*	 Good luck to you too and I guess we will have to agree to disagree
t1_dus450m	0	*	Find me a country having a sizeable population with zero gun violence. And I do mean zero. 
t1_dur6lna	0	*	Would you care to share your alternative argument or simply say nonsense?
t1_durc91n	0	*	Yes but how? What would the rule be? You can only have one gun per person?
t1_dsfer8i	0	*	The Department of Human Services for this state...I thought I made that clear.  I feel like I am talking to my 16 year old.
t1_dsxrzqp	0	*	In that state or city. Sucks for them. Rights are rights.
t1_dsw3tk8	1	*	Grr MacArthur
t1_dswn3vc	0	*	I mean actual lawmakers, people who create this policy for a living and have a team of analysts in their corner to show them what works in real life.
t1_dsm5ce7	0	*	how many aneurysms were there in the US last year?    &nbsp;   that's right - no-one gives a fuck 
t1_duajt6v	0	*	Jesus Christ you sound like Cathy Newman with your loaded questions.  
t1_ds1ljgl	0	*	Soccer is fun, but its very boring. Television soccer is why TIVO exists.   Whats the nature of the game in your words?
t1_dumcjw0	0	*	Right, that totally helped these guys. And the thousands of others killed, kidnapped, and/or raped.
t1_dumsamo	0	*	Are you going to tell the women that escaped that a quick death would have been better than surviving?  Anyone can play a game of rhetorical questions. I'm not going to follow you down that path.
t1_dumekp4	0	*	See... that's the problem. It actually *wasn't* a joke, which is the whole deal here.   It was some semi-unrelated shit with /s tagged at the end. 
t1_dumf5rs	0	*	Yup.   We could hire security.  Any other good options?  (dark sarcasm) Maybe a bigger sign that says we don't have guns or any way to defend ourselves, please don't attack in bold letters? 
t1_dtrmpm5	0	*	I wouldn't bring the FBI into this conversation. Your side has already proved you lack respect for law enforcement.
t1_dtrwo4o	0	*	Drug addiction *resulted* in her murder.   How is that a foreign concept? 
t1_dtrpbfa	0	*	Oh, my, so edgy.  
t1_dsl33f6	0	*	Girl, I can keep going. You have to come up with something better. (Also, isn't that emoji...*dated*?)
t1_dskrmve	1	*	I was going to say that if your Canadian then it's perfectly acceptable. Damn all I can think about now is pancakes and syrup. Why am I still in this thread?
t1_dsjrx7h	0	*	Lol tf, please name one buzzword I used. 
t1_dstk4x3	1	*	Yeah... I'm the brainwashed one...   > FYI American migrants did exactly what you said in Texas.  Now that's a nice juicy cut of whataboutism.   Typical zionist. 
t1_dsjrw3r	0	*	Aw I struck a nerve. U0001f60d
t1_dszmtpg	1	*	Lol ya gay 
t1_dsps5cd	0	*	Yes, enforced in this context absolutely means legally.  If you're criticizing a large swath of people and insulting even more, expect you'll get criticized back.
t1_dsk1lr6	1	*	Then their children tend to be way worse than either their parents or the native population.
t1_dsjwi0p	0	*	Didn't you hear, the Swedish government doesn't think the Swedes have a culture and needs to bring in immigrants to culture the place up a bit.
t1_dsl1b5s	1	*	Doctors dont do as well here unless youre a specialist. However, they still do VERY well (like couple hundred thousand a year). Plus med students have much less debt here lol.
t1_dsktkf8	1	*	I like Guinness. It's not my favorite but it's pretty good. 
t1_dskaa82	0	*	> Except you're completely missing the point, and it's that Whites are the only people who ever vote conservative at all.    Most republicans are white, true. But, so what?
t1_dsldq7x	0	*	Got a source on that, cupcake? Or are you watching too much Alex Jones?
t1_dsjutao	0	*	and way less cunts like yourself
t1_dsmiooh	1	*	You can believe whatever you like. Let me know how many of them vote Democrat after they finish. Because unless they do that it is a waste of time. 
t1_dskz51u	0	*	But they did, why won't you answer the question. 
t1_dsjxca4	0	*	If there was video of the black kids all hanging out there together as the robbery went on, no it wouldn't be wrong. They should have left. 
t1_dskyt1d	0	*	It's okay that you can't make any real arguments. You can always improve. Embrace who you are! :)
t1_dskqx55	0	*	Yeah okay. 
t1_dslmkef	1	*	;)
t1_dskjfid	0	*	Well then I stand corrected. Two thirds just sounded a bit high, but their data seems to be in order so I'll admit I was wrong on that one.
t1_dsjz4qn	1	*	Im just posting it until you realize that the President did in fact call self-identified white nationalists and white supremacists very fine people.
t1_dska5tt	0	*	You are not addressing the person in front of you.  I am not a strawman.
t1_dsjw1xf	0	*	No I'm pretty sure he said those thing in this context.
t1_dsjx4uz	0	*	..... Or just have your own rally a different day.
t1_dsjt826	0	*	Troll account everyone. Downvote, move on.
t1_dsjwnua	1	*	this is true, and doesn't change my point in any way.
t1_dskgd7c	0	*	They are also terrible people. Your point? 
t1_dsjx1v5	0	*	A heart attack from someone doing what to her?
t1_dsk6uxf	1	*	I'm casually mentioning a place that has a different healthcare system than the other places in Canada. Each province has their own healthcare system. 
t1_dsk0piq	1	*	We're all bots not Russians.  Don't you know the guy elected president has no public support who voted for him?
t1_dsjwu0v	0	*	Sorry, I don't believe in hell so not much to be worried about.
t1_dsjz81y	0	*	Get the fuck over yourself 
t1_dslibpo	1	*	And your response to the rest of my argument would be?
t1_dsk56b6	0	*	Wannabe Che, yeah.  I have no problem with wanting significant regulations on corporations. But socialism has crashed and burned every time it's been tried. That's just foolish.
t1_dsjvqn0	0	*	Ok, use examples of how great it was before Republicans changed it. What was so damn fantastic?
t1_dskxyto	1	*	It's not even close. 
t1_dsjzrvb	0	*	Very thoughtful of you to know what irony is 
t1_dskad6q	0	*	Thanks for the correction, that still trips me up.  But isnt that hypocritical coming from a guy who modded /r/t_d? Isnt that the epitome of caring too much?
t1_dsjug04	1	*	Tbh I enjoy shooting, and you're the one who brought up race. Also, I posted studies and facts, you posted an emotional youtube video. Hmmm.
t1_dskuhx6	1	*	Youre right xenophobic Germans always works out for the greater good of the world 
t1_dslaque	1	*	Thanks dude!
t1_dsjzgsi	0	*	Mainly because were not talking about skilled labor from Norway. We're talking about skilled labor from 2nd and 3rd world countries. Cmon now.
t1_dskdr1g	1	*	Lol why do you think that's the only place I get info? You assume that. 
t1_dsxaco1	0	*	Lol lol lol <insert smiley here>
t1_dsluh8w	0	*	Willingness to kill will prevent situations where killing would be required. 
t1_dsk7p2g	1	*	It wasn't a Trump rally, it was specifically a far-right rally. It's essentially a white nationalist movement.
t1_dsk1baf	0	*	Lol you cant be serious... its literally how much the average person spends on healthcare per year.
t1_dsjy7cl	0	*	The OP said there's a successful track record for rehabilitating murderers, and I asked if it also worked for mass murderers. I'm sorry that you can't read.
t1_dusejfi	0	*	I hope you never have to eat your words. 
t1_dv1uq1n	1	*	And until you present it. I have no reason to assume you're correct.
t1_du803yn	1	*	I believe it because it's based on fact. I'm sorry that you don't care about such details.
t1_dthx412	1	*	You probably have 12 or so bullet points about how it violated the Geneva Conventions, provided by the research experts at Koch Bros for Oligarchy, Inc, a 501(c)(3).
t1_dt8vxwg	0	*	Hezbollah is the largest organized group of terrorists on earth. And the biggest organized terrorist group on earth are your heroes. You're so cute! 
t1_dt6edf7	1	*	awesome, thank you for the explanation. I learned something today.
t1_dtvrmmj	0	*	You still haven't even acknowledged the evidence I gave you and just resorted to childish name calling.   Makes you come across as irrational.  
t1_dtwgdxm	0	*	I don't think fgm should all be lumped together. There is a wide spectrum.
t1_dthqlh6	1	*	There is no such thing. Simple you mean. That's a good thing. Dumb is not something an argument can be without being wrong too. If I am correct then that's what it is. Correct but simple.
t1_ds631w9	0	*	My bad, I wasnt paying attention to the usernames. 
t1_ds71og3	1	*	It does. Others also have good protections but the absolute power of the US is stronger. Germany for example is far less free. 
t1_ds5wlqz	0	*	You're a lost cause if you think that the government will completely and fairly judge what's right and what's wrong. 
t1_ds5wpd2	1	*	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McCarthyism I'm having a tough time finding anything to back up your statement that a surprising majority were. Please point us to a SOURCE.

t1_ds6b5ps	1	*	Aren't we like a lot smaller then you lot? Well in countrysize, we're taller ofcourse.
t1_ds7gk24	1	*	Thats is not a simplistic black and white adversareal position for which I can take a side for or against. This will not do.
t1_dt0d3nj	0	*	From what I can tell, you are Irish. You have just as much reason to despise Trump as I do...
t1_dukdvap	1	*	are you attempting to make a point? because i'm saying that the local govt is corrupt
t1_dty35rc	0	*	Yo dawg, I heard you liked your inceptions inside your inception and incepted an inception for your things-within-things.

t1_dty2t0i	0	*	I'm actually not, you're just being an ass.
t1_dty2ouu	1	*	I was perfectly clear.   IF THE SUN IS UP FOR A LONGER TIME WHEN YOU ARE HOME, IT WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON HOW YOU COOL YOUR HOME. I can't believe i have to explain this to you shitstains.
t1_dty2lna	0	*	I worked construction a bit in the summers as a young man, and I was in the army. I'm a professor now. I don't do manual labor if that's what you mean. 
t1_dty50b8	1	*	Haha yeah I remember that one. My early days of learning jQuery were filled with joke responses like those. 
t1_dt3dh4e	0	*	There were prisoners there that we now know had zero evidence against them. Why were those people kept prisoner for years?
t1_dt1bagj	1	*	Ok. I dont care enough to remember my posts or yours. Sorry
t1_dssu7az	1	*	I got annoyed with one one time and challenged her to name the state capital of the state she was supposed to be in.  Floundering ensued.
t1_duesgt1	0	*	Yes, but I see it as common courtesy. We all have to drag through the shit each day, might as well make it a bit better by being cordial and nice. 
t1_dugzmo9	1	*	Answered you question should be answered YOUR question. I hope your boss doesnt fire you for all these shitty mistakes. 
t1_dugr091	0	*	You said indian, not me.    Your racism is exactly what trump is trying to channel.  Funny how you are the point.
t1_duhdl58	0	*	You're the sad person that is so happy that other people are downvoting someone else's views. That's pathetic. Only a loser would think that it's nice if other people denigrate other peoples' views.
t1_dugzhu9	1	*	Its youre not your. U0001f1f7U0001f1faU0001f1f7U0001f1faU0001f1f7U0001f1fa

t1_dv23g6t	1	*	No, is that what you do? 
t1_duqomby	0	*	It doesn't say it was before 2014 either.
t1_dt3xd69	1	*	You mean during the time of the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact? Lmao
t1_dur2etw	0	*	Doesn't matter if it's from Wiki or not, still plagiarism.   
t1_dus9wcf	0	*	You are clearly a troll. Bye bye U0001f601
t1_ds3gsjh	0	*	I'll pray for you :-)
t1_ds2xdmu	0	*	Can you spell atheist? And you're wrong about what atheists believe or agnostics for that matter - go read something to inform yourself. 
t1_dsbpkcx	0	*	You mean the 850,000 Middle Eastern Jews kicked out of Cairo, Baghdad, Beirut, Yemen and elsewhere?
t1_dubumzp	0	*	How? You e now flipped 4 times. 
t1_dt2q7mo	0	*	> you would think  Oh believe me, I was never under any illusion that it was clever.
t1_dt17j84	0	*	So the one the Democrats used to judge Obama is now wrong because it helps Trump?  SHOCKING
t1_dt1oimo	1	*	No trouble at all, and your original reply is still wrong. should I refer you to the second sentence again ?
t1_dt1fe5y	0	*	You're arguing for full socialism because the US has police. I'm arguing against it because it starves people to death.
t1_dsky0ew	0	*	Now we've got nuclear winter, and everyone's dead. Except Australia. And they're still like, wtf?
t1_dtie8o9	0	*	Im sorry, Im not sure what you dont believe.
t1_dtjxwuo	1	*	Sorry, nothing about what you said gives me any confidence that your other post about polling is anything but delusional garbage. Makes sense that you identify as an evangelical.
t1_dtk83p3	0	*	Yeah, that's the fucking point. It's got a literal definition contextually relevant for a reason. So it doesn't get tossed around lightly.
t1_duqycsv	1	*	Lol what a load of bullshit. His mental health is fine. It's all you guys freaking out and raging at him who need psych help.
t1_duqv93o	0	*	So do u want us there?  We can multi task no problem.
t1_dtl4veb	0	*	You sound even dumber than before

t1_dudh1ca	0	*	I'll take your inability to clarify as a concession.
t1_dudesk3	0	*	To which investigation are you referring?
t1_dud5pgz	0	*	It's bad that we have a Russian spy as President. 
t1_dud8ay0	0	*	O I know they still would be trying but let's not pretend that they don't prefer Trump as he makes their job easier.
t1_dud793r	1	*	and you admitted you are feminine
t1_dudfvgx	1	*	Lmao give up. You lost.
t1_dudmw3g	0	*	Way to move the goalposts. So you concede the Russians *do* want Trump in the job? 
t1_dud9e92	1	*	Fuck me for wanting evidence that this is at all connected to Trump's campaign and isn't the doing of a provoked group of Russians. Saddam has weapons of mass destruction, let's go in!
t1_dud9a3b	1	*	Not just deals, he is just rude and undiplomatic. In Europe the press has made a caricature of him.
t1_dud71m1	1	*	You think Trump will get away with his bullshit forever........ no just at least 3 more years.  hahahahahahha
t1_dud70f5	0	*	hahahaha waaaaah waaaah waaaah RACISM!  waaa waaaah waaah MAH RUSSIAN NARRATIVE! waaaah waaaah waaaah

t1_dudiwu7	0	*	Sure, there are always a small number of exceptions, but by and large those are the two main choices, so as a rule of thumb it's perfectly fine.
t1_dudfjqu	0	*	How about if I just continue to watch you get dunked on? Its much more fun.
t1_dud78jc	0	*	hahahaha you just admitted you are vegan.    hahahahahaha soyboy
t1_dudy6j7	0	*	Positive.  My family on my father's side has been here since the 1600s and is Native American on my mother's side.  I'm as American as they come
t1_dud8wl7	0	*	Yes, one of them was ostensibly due to his involvement during the trump campaign - we will see what comes of it.
t1_dua5n58	0	*	But in the next election they will want Trump to lose as he would by then have experience?
t1_dvb8rh1	0	*	>  It's in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.  sounds nice, remind me again the section the Constitution that is in? Or maybe federal statutes? 
t1_du9rkd0	0	*	the name's Kevin, actually.  not that you'd care, you just wanna repeat your second-hand propaganda and feel like you just TOLD a guy.
t1_dtgvvsj	1	*	Ok. You still aren't eating enough if you aren't growing. No additional information is changing that reality. This is an absurdly simple problem to fix. Eat more.
t1_dthlloz	0	*	Rofl I don't understand the scope when I made several sentences in that last response that made that lie from you abundantly and clearly false.   We're done here. 
t1_dsjxyuu	1	*	How do you plan to put it outside?
t1_dt7zwnl	0	*	I like how you are deflecting.  Instead of admitting that Europe screwed over other nations for hundreds of years u deflect.
t1_dt90iky	1	*	Whatever you say.
t1_dt8eqwp	0	*	What are you even on about? I've already shown you exactly where AfD votes came from. Are you this delusional that facts thrown directy in your face don't matter?
t1_dt9vkby	1	*	Well you're obviously an oxygen thief.
t1_dt6skxq	0	*	Yeah, I bet you cry softly at night because of the white genocide enacted by halal food trucks, big boy.

t1_duvncqs	0	*	Dont know. They very well could have been born into china or else peacefully joimed up
t1_du62k0j	0	*	Are you guys seriously fighting about this, that is fucking ridiculous. Get a hold of yourself. Your fighting about  if a child rapist getting murdered or not In jail is normal.
t1_due03cr	1	*	A distinction without a difference.
t1_dudvahy	0	*	>legitimate business strategy  Are all you people liars or is it mostly just mainlanders?
t1_dueirtp	0	*	people will be hurt in a war that's just facts - there is a trade war occurring right now with China and that's also fact
t1_ds5xt0j	0	*	Agreed. Bannon got him the power but the GOP eventually got him to turn on Banon. Looks like Banon may want to destroy his creation.
t1_ds5edhj	0	*	Mind pointing out a point/reference that you feel is contradictory? I will read it myself and see.
t1_ds7654b	0	*	I lost? What did I lose?
t1_ds5wloj	0	*	And this was Russias plan all along...
t1_ds5v5ya	1	*	> How is me saying that you and other Americans are too lazy to protest Trump a stereotype?  Stating that all X/Y/Z people are the same,... is literally the dictionary definition of stereotype.  
t1_dteln3s	0	*	So where did Michael Wolf say he's unsure if most of the book is true? You still haven't provided a source for this.
t1_dsnsa3o	1	*	I do think there are too many humans around and we need more control.A lot more wolves would be a cool way to do it, less people would be fat aswell.
t1_dsn7bjx	0	*	But saying I want to see humans kill l wolves is right? Just let it go man, we have different priorities.
t1_dtiwzmq	0	*	So you turn a blind eye to Crimea and Syria?
t1_dtipd09	0	*	Pot calling kettle much? I think the one posting pragraphs of drivel is the dishonest one here. You either don't know much about the world, and Russia, or you are simply spreading disinfo.
t1_dv4t4si	0	*	Yet they still existed.
t1_dv3r7pp	0	*	You're right, it's totally reasonable that some people would rather watch their own country burn than accept 4 years of a competent president they don't personally like. 
t1_dv3aw2o	0	*	They chose Clinton. Your god emperor fucking sucks and Americans hate him. Those are the realities you can't accept.
t1_dv3dsaw	0	*	That's not being defensive, that's using facts and knowledge to support an argument.  You should try it sometime.
t1_dv41b4l	1	*	I literally have.
t1_dv5hrvl	0	*	2 posts ago you said something with a completely different inclination.   You may want to take a break from the drugs for a while.
t1_dv4mmyg	1	*	Check his post history. He's a pede from T_D. Irrational anger is his default state.
t1_dv35ryy	0	*	How are you getting 126% more?   They just released a study that used a bigger sample case(more tweets) and it was around 50/50.
t1_dv5pxs9	0	*	The irony. For example, you said she explicitly called Sanders sexist. Where? Give an actual quote. 
t1_dv3cf10	1	*	They didn't spend millions on a disinformation campaign because it wouldn't work.   It wasn't about hacking the machines and changing votes - it was about changing minds. Propaganda.   And it worked. 
t1_dv3dpc9	0	*	>People are insecure in general  This is a fact  >What you perceive to be some sort of sexism is just some people being sensitive.  Fact.  Please play again.
t1_dv3izei	0	*	No, I wanted proof they fixed an election. Not that they were perfectly reasonably biased against a politician that attempted to co-opt their structure to run for president.

t1_dv3bayg	0	*	No, sounds like insecure to me, just like all the women who are insecure about the way they look too.
t1_dv3sqj0	1	*	He's Rushin' through his typing, obviously.

t1_dv3sx6t	0	*	Guys I got this, vote for me next time. Booze and porn mags for all the homies!
t1_dv4iqu6	0	*	I wasn't being annoyed, I was lampooning the tone of the post I was replying to - a parody of it, and looks like most didn't get it - I probably played it too hard. oh well.
t1_dv4136e	1	*	Well, for one, don't identify me with the people at T_D. I don't post there. I don't frequent it either.  Secondly, try not to be a douche. I was asking a question out of ignorance, not malice.
t1_dv3bueq	0	*	It's so good!
t1_dv3ok3o	1	*	By almost all polls and metrics he lost all the debates. The question is did the people who voted actually watch them. 
t1_dv41ifv	0	*	Some people are more equal than others.  Some people interpret things better than others  You can't just say your interpretation is correct without actually providing any facts.
t1_dv3ki0t	0	*	If you can put struts and boosters on this kremlin I will get it to space.
t1_dv3h6aa	1	*	Do you have a citation for that?
t1_dv3pz24	0	*	no maybe I don't know can you repeat that question?
t1_dv3wvkb	0	*	Russia orchestrated or promoted BLM and BlueLM rallies as well as Resist and Pro-Trump rallies according to Mueller's investigation. If you're disputing that then state it. 
t1_dv41f19	1	*	That second part didn't make a lot of sense, but it's cool that you disagree with me without spewing hatred.
t1_dv3eove	0	*	No one said that, but now that you've aired out your thoughts, we all know how you feel
t1_dv3uw92	1	*	Exactly

t1_dsf3znd	1	*	My bad then :) 
t1_dsfuowd	0	*	Don't try to skirt this, I want you to stop being lazy and provide the evidence that you claim exists for this specific allegation.
t1_dsf7t0x	0	*	On average, who is poorer? Who has higher rate of single parent households? Who has worse neighbourhoods? etc. You can't claim it's white people because we both know it's not.
t1_dsf8ge6	0	*	Sure, keep arguing that black families have overall less income than whites on average. 
t1_dsf8iv7	1	*	 feels > reals for white men 
t1_dtx3zu0	1	*	Why do you say that? Assuming youre taking B12 supplements whats the big deal?  If you wanted, do you know where one might find the big tanks?

t1_dubyrx8	1	*	>deceptive corporate talking points  my sides
t1_duf64az	1	*	Youre proving my point
t1_duc9qlu	1	*	Right on. Drove by whiteside an hour and a half ago.
t1_dub9f5t	0	*	Your making comments about US society, why is it stupid to ask how much time you have spent in the country?
t1_dubpubd	1	*	Lol ok
t1_dubqkzc	0	*	You can attempt to continue deflecting, or you can man up and try prove your side.
t1_dtl1x6c	1	*	You're fudging the statistics! /s

t1_dtl2638	1	*	Whatever you say, guy.
t1_dtm010e	1	*	Oooh getting better. 
t1_dtkz4jn	0	*	I wasn't until you put me on the spot...
t1_dtyubb7	0	*	Why is he orange? Don't want to be called a Cheeto, don't paint yourself orange. Everyone got to shit on Obama for being black, so here is our comeback, and your situation actually is indefensible.
t1_dtjxasj	0	*	I'm not saying that, you fucking idiot. 
t1_dthmmzg	0	*	http://dailysignal.com/2017/12/04/supreme-court-upholds-trump-travel-ban/
t1_dthq0qh	1	*	Thats pretty fair, though I question if it would have gone down that way.  To be fair also, if solid evidence comes out of blatant Trump collusion after all of this ill support action against him. 
t1_dthtel9	1	*	Please explain?  Or you can just write how it's all nonsense.  That works too...
t1_dtiu86l	0	*	you must be fun at parties
t1_dthgvq0	0	*	Really? Because that really makes them sound like a rubber stamp court if they never deny requests..  
t1_dti0qif	1	*	Ah yes the ol hugbox.  Very devastating stuff.   
t1_dthclif	0	*	Not a single person would consider you reasonable.
t1_dthmpqp	1	*	I'm not the same person who you started this conversation. I was just trying to understand your point of view a little better.
t1_dthl8ml	1	*	I know you are, but what am I.
t1_dthmap8	0	*	More like Fire and Fury by Miachael Wolff, so you can get an idea of what a dumb and fat piece of shit your president is. 
t1_dthnzse	0	*	That collusion, in and of itself, is not in question. 
t1_dthdpo9	0	*	....I honestly think I am wasting my time. Thanks for the chit chat.
t1_dth0xu9	0	*	I don't know what that means but go for it. Remind me on Monday and pick a charity of your liking. 
t1_dsspabb	0	*	Let's stamp an extra tenner on your sentence for that. 
t1_dsslc3v	0	*	No I actually just have a framed picture of Lenin.
t1_dstwky2	0	*	Also indulge me a bit more, and tell me what your dad did with the money, since apparently he didn't leave much of it to you. After all, that was the original purpose of this conversation.
t1_dsslcqe	1	*	20 million plus people all of which deserved it.
t1_dsiqll6	0	*	So emotional.
t1_dsipo32	0	*	Wow. I knew Americans were stereotyped as not having any geographical knowledge, but thanks for proving it.   Your government who despises you is slowly eroding your freedoms and rights. 
t1_dsnl0q5	0	*	Because I just said, there are groups that can point you to other groups, or websites/organizations that acknowledge and take action on MGM
t1_dtbe2ve	1	*	Thanks, I kind of suspected that.
t1_dtgl2kr	0	*	Kinda wish I could beat you senseless for not voting... and everyone else who didnt vote but could have done so.
t1_dth24b8	0	*	Are you in Congress? There's a really good thread over in r/neutralpolitics about this. Check it out if you want to know more about this.
t1_dtipmmu	0	*	I clearly can read because I correctly determined that you are a hypocrite :) 
t1_dtgrd3p	1	*	Isn't it fabullous? He tu quoque'd me twice in a row. 
t1_dth83m2	0	*	What lol? This isn't an academic exercise up for argument. We cannot be at war with another nation unless congress has declared such. The constitution is pretty explicit about that... 
t1_dtkjetr	0	*	And the DNC is very aware of that fact, just like the GOP is. Soooo.....
t1_dtiu0l5	1	*	Pointing out that US has no problem siding with murderous dictators when convenient, and continue to turn the other cheek when there is no political or material interest is not whataboutism.  
t1_dtgr5w5	0	*	No even before that, they've always been making up conspiracies about the clintons 
t1_dtgjzwx	1	*	You don't remember occupy? Protesting is illegal. 
t1_dthn6ji	0	*	lol k, I guess just watch and see the president be arrested for treason or whatever fantasy you guys choose to  entertain.  Its not going to cause a crisis, its not illegal. 
t1_dthy963	1	*	Well thanks to trump he's actually helped me greatly with my healthcare   I use the va so you're going to have to try a little harder to insult me. 
t1_dth0p3o	1	*	I realized I replied to the wrong post. That dude already deleted his (idiotic) post.  My bad man. Give us a hug U0001f917U0001f917
t1_dti4xja	0	*	I can understand why you feel this way, but you are a damn fool to dismiss the Russia issue as bullshit.
t1_dtyxrrj	0	*	How about eating your own words and starting here:  http://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/

t1_dt4wo4x	0	*	Go smoke some outdoor ya bum  -fucking idiot
t1_dtw1ik5	0	*	True, for 110 a week I feel like I'd need to love what I do, be making disgusting amounts of money or towards it in the future, like investors and what not,  or building my own business.
t1_dtvzn3j	0	*	How is that not capturing an innocent person and using them for slave labor?
t1_du0cfv4	1	*	I try to know and read as much as I can. I recommend doing the same. I know Marxists detest knowledge and intelligence but youre not in power yet.
t1_du0e7rx	0	*	You sound like Cathy Newman.
t1_duv00r1	0	*	They dont know whats causing that though 
t1_ds46wq0	0	*	>It fits your narrative to pretend that China isn't communist at all. When the truth, like I said above, is that they are still communist with some tweaks to how they handle their private sector. 
t1_dtoxrh4	1	*	What about the dropping white phosphorus on civilians index. Got one of those?
t1_dtnxmhb	0	*	Yeah, because he has gone through many documents, histories, and reports on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict since 1948. I'd say that informs his bias 
t1_dtohnyt	0	*	It's was majority Jewish in 1948. This is not contravertial. 
t1_ds8avtx	0	*	JEsus christ youre so thick. Im going to stop replying to you now.
t1_ds82c8r	1	*	It is impposible to have capitalism without screwing everybody bit the rich. The sole purpose of capitalism is to make the elite rich and everybody else poor.
t1_du8y00w	0	*	Oh wait every country does... its almost as if that is how society works.   I like how your house doesn't flood when it rains. Do you know why that is? 
t1_dulqre7	0	*	I shouldn't take the stance that cannabis is a GRAS substance because the best thing you can come up with is a single study claiming an admittedly weak effect on complex memory functions?
t1_duqau3y	0	*	No, I'm saying the negative effects are really quite mild even for heavy use and furthermore affect small portions of the population.
t1_dth0e5j	1	*	Coming from you, I'll take that as praise 
t1_dtf1302	0	*	Just because some women have a certain stance does not make it not sexist.
t1_dtfy46t	0	*	So how does it happen then?   And again why didn't it develop properly during the last couple of periods of unrest
t1_dtf52cm	1	*	*Goddammit noooooooooo*
t1_dtg1yv4	1	*	Odojas gave an anecdote about power/money in a relationship. Wasn't rly sure what his goal was tbh. I just think the marital rape fact is important so I said it. 
t1_dtkjthe	1	*	True, nothing is representative of the whole country
t1_dtf9zcq	0	*	No not really. It doesn't matter how many people are in your personal anecdote when there's an actual study to prove or disprove it. 
t1_dthvq2z	0	*	Lol you just insulted muslim countries saying they have changed it to a mere form of cultural identity as if Western muslim are better in that they are not influenced by local culture.   
t1_dtjls6f	1	*	In all honestly, your responses are funny to me
t1_dthteox	1	*	Why do you assume i have no idea what it is when i have not replied lol?   You still need to read the book to understand the difference between Sahih and Mutawattir btw.   
t1_du4wmbn	1	*	Like your thinking 
t1_du4n23m	1	*	Just an arrogant holier-than-thou point.
t1_du3mxvx	1	*	Seems like we need more competition when it comes to our elected officials because our two party system doesn't seem to be addressing your good points.
t1_du2bywg	1	*	All apartment complexs near me do it, and the apartment I just moved into was the first private land lord I have encountered to do it. I plan on doing it after I buy a duplex.
t1_dsfl86x	0	*	See the comment above. You don't need to be so defensive. 
t1_duynqw6	0	*	Still waiting. True or false? The US Government's per capita spending on healthcare signficantly outpaces the Canadian government's. 
t1_dux9weh	0	*	Because the work we're talking about is not profitable, despite being useful and desirable in other ways.
t1_duysog9	0	*	Ok, hide behind complications that don't actually add up.
t1_due6sp2	0	*	Its become a huge part of the Jewish identity.  It would be many generations until someone uncircumcised would be accepted in the Orthodox community.

t1_du9cr7f	1	*	lol ;)
t1_du740hh	0	*	China is no longer third world. They are very developed. Don't you think a change in their policies is past due?
t1_dubys86	1	*	Your brain tells that the earth is flat? Mine doesn't.
t1_du6zim2	0	*	what country is being bashed lmao?  yeah probably another helpless victim with an inferiority complex lol.  it is entertaining tho.
t1_du70c2n	0	*	DT has a habit of being nice about people that are nice/loyal to him, regardless of their sins 
t1_du7tpqp	1	*	What words were left out?
t1_dsqlrln	0	*	Stop replying to me then?
t1_dsoor2a	0	*	Luckily interests don't depend on trust. The US has no gain from threatening Canada militarily, and vice versa. 
t1_dspshie	0	*	Yeah, and I was talking purely about Canada's strategy. I feel like my words are being twisted.  Again, my comment still stands.
t1_dt6cpix	0	*	> Fast forward 23 years and Putin forgoes all diplomacy and takes it with guns and tanks. Then he killed a civilian airliner   take your meds
t1_dtg1pvt	0	*	>You are the only one who wants to even discuss her here  Sure. ;)
t1_dua4ajy	0	*	Look at the Uranium One fiasco for some real Russian collusion, will Bill Clinton take half a million from Russia. Those chicken's will actually come home to roost this year.
t1_duvp56i	0	*	You would do well to understand this.
t1_duvp6wp	1	*	You believe you can spout nonsense and expect to be taken seriously?  OK.
t1_dsiro61	0	*	Now you're acting like internal polling doesn't exist? 
t1_dtx42lb	0	*	What does it matter? Canada is more aligned with the EU than with the US.
t1_ds5gysp	1	*	So the leader of the Republican party is an outlier?
t1_dsc2vgv	0	*	Yeah a youtube video is great source /s  Want me to point out how the empire of mali was doing great until the europeans conquered it?
t1_dsc1wfn	1	*	Ah insults. I dont respond to people who give insults. Consider yourself reported and blocked. 
t1_dsbyy91	1	*	My apologies if I mislead you, glad we were able to clear that up!

t1_dt1pp3i	0	*	At one point I was like you and it bothered me that I was in the 1% and then I realized not being poor is pretty cool and I should appreciate it instead of being a little bitch. 
t1_dt1xacs	0	*	Why do you keep mentioning poor people, nobody has said anything about poor people except you?
t1_dt23utf	0	*	I'm going to take a wild guess here and assume there were no black kids in any of her classes?
t1_dt26emz	0	*	Wait, what are you arguing here? Because I am advocating that if you work hard and smart you *are* more likely to end up with money. What are you saying?
t1_dt3aues	0	*	Taxing them more wouldnt do anything at all for the average citizen. Thats why the calls for them to be taxed more are seriously misguided. 
t1_dt20jta	0	*	It's not about this generation. It's about the next. The idea is to more to discourage people from taking up the habit than it is to encourage people who currently have the habit to kick it.
t1_dt2487v	0	*	Nobody really knows the number in the US, do they? 
t1_dt2cvqw	0	*	Those policies wont work because its a natural phenomenon. Read some literature and youll come to understand why 
t1_dt2vjun	1	*	Now we're on the same page
t1_dt1sxoo	0	*	Workers pool their resources together and set up a worker-owned canning cooperative. You realize these types of businesses already right https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondragon_Corporation
t1_dt3nmse	0	*	Massive chunk but in comparison to the percent of wealth to percent of taxes, it doesn't balance out, see /u/upvotesthenrages  comment just above.

t1_dt1nb2d	0	*	I don't understand, he earns over $32k a year and that makes him a 1%'er.   He is in the 1% and you are calling him a slave?
t1_dt2bjih	0	*	You can't say black markets instead say MARKETS OF COLOR 
t1_dt1uu0m	0	*	You have a very deluded perspective of reality if that is what you truly believe
t1_dt26nwv	0	*	The trouble is not all rich people get rich by skimming huge amounts off the labor of workers. Some do, and arguably, most do, but it's not entirely clear cut (hence the political debate about it).
t1_dt2u71u	0	*	Yeah exactly. So the results of their labors apply both ways, some to their own initiative and some to society, and should be shared between the two.
t1_dt2bxkb	0	*	Let's agree to disagree because you don't seem to understand what I said.

t1_dudmgys	1	*	Well, having been the victim of a violent attack, I'm quite thankful I was able to defend myself. Better to be alive than a statistic
t1_dsh03s6	1	*	> how much religion and desire to maintain power has split so many people who had lived together for centuries...  That is actually the saddest part. :(
t1_dsl3cq5	0	*	Because if they don't it's treason?  Or because it personally upsets your feelings?
t1_duhp75x	0	*	Yet another set of assumptions, and you'd kill an underage girl based off it. No matter, your insistence on not giving this the thought it deserves is telling.
t1_duiddl7	0	*	Roughly half the country (give or take a few percent), yes.
t1_dskwd4l	0	*	I'm 30. You're old. There's a huge generational gap starting around 24/25 as Millennials change over to Gen Z.
t1_dsj0pg8	0	*	Yes I'm sure all those tech companies desperately want to put their money into a technology made popular by Heroin dealers and pedophiles. Surely nothing could go wrong with that decision. 
t1_dujtxbm	0	*	That would be the first time I've ever been accused of being alt-right. 
t1_duj84wy	0	*	Are you trying to make a point? Maybe its because Im slow and misinformed, but I dont get what youre trying to say. 
t1_duje2ul	1	*	Thats where conspiracy theories shine most.
t1_duj4ltj	1	*	You've got to be kidding me.
t1_duj43g3	0	*	Yeah, no, we're past that part. We already finished talking. I said Toodles! and everything. Go do something else.
t1_duj9qzq	1	*	You're terrible at this.
t1_duli4rb	0	*	Oh yes - it really matters that another person has no idea what was in that video and upvoted your post.
t1_duj6kcn	1	*	Ahah I come from a commonwealth country myself. Also a 1st yr student. Thankfully I don't fo this shit offline.
t1_duiyzcb	0	*	If /u/InPaceViribus had any intelligence in him, he wouldn't even be attempting to argue such an easily refuted point.
t1_dumjawz	1	*	Oh I see, so you're just a nation of selfish individuals who don't care for the welfare of your nation. Now I know to avoid, thanks.
t1_dutr7aw	0	*	I'll listen. 
t1_duj2m3u	0	*	His views align with a very common Russian argument against homosexuality.

t1_dujim0h	1	*	Yep usually you wait until around 16 or so (while on blockers, living as your desired gender), then start HRT. 
t1_duj7nt6	0	*	I hear ya. Stay strong fellow human. 
t1_dujd2qs	1	*	Shits complicated 
t1_duj8m5x	0	*	Yup, I am from Russia and that stuff is same here
t1_dukgque	0	*	Ok. Thank you for reiterating your views. I urge you to please go read what researchers have learned instead of trusting your own anecdotes.
t1_dujc7wl	1	*	I'll have to take your word for it. I started transitioning in my twenties, so I was able to simply sign a form and start HRT. 
t1_duj1uiw	1	*	That was a fantastic idea. 
t1_dujnm5o	0	*	Im guessing your from philly?  Im Delaware. Seems like fate oh oh oh its magic. Do you hear music too?

t1_dujc6iu	1	*	XCOM and Team Rainbow unite!
t1_duuf9ab	1	*	The debt which had it's seized assets released...
t1_ds6r9b1	0	*	His point was being rich leads to mental illness, reread his comment again.  I had a far more detailed comment, but reddit gave me an error 500, and I had to refresh the page, so I lost everything :(
t1_ds6iwgv	1	*	So? My point is that using lasers as anti-missile tech isn't new, secret or unknown.
t1_dsaauu9	1	*	you really shouldn't lose your time on that
t1_dsfbsqc	1	*	Yeah, all in the same thread. What's your point, dude? I haven't gone through your profile, I've just been interested in the topic of synthetic meat for years.
t1_ds6qjye	0	*	> Mental illnesses are at a historic high.  prove it
t1_ds9fhwd	0	*	Show me evidence that Obama and the article is wrong, otherwise why should I believe you?

t1_dum6hsf	0	*	Where is your source for that claim? 
t1_dt0v9xh	1	*	.... that answers *my* question as a yes, not yours.
t1_dsyqmga	1	*	Thanks for clarifying what you really meant, bruh go back to San Francisco and continue to ignore everyone elses problems. Communism is one of the most selfish ideologies ever conceived.
t1_dsvx3he	0	*	>literally no one who works in the warehouses, where my link cites as the Criminally underpaid employees location  Yea nice source there.  Really helping your argument. /s
t1_dsxoi0k	0	*	We are talking about the political theory of socialism.  Not about dictatorships which had absolutely nothing to do with socialism.
t1_duc0sks	1	*	Thanks bud! Have a great weekend!
t1_dsutjlx	0	*	Do you know what repatriation means?
t1_dsv0z3j	1	*	There is currently a slavery apologist in this thread with 4 upvotes. Your upvotes mean nothing. Just a higher concentration of a certain type of person in this thread. 
t1_dsuufew	1	*	Motherfucker illegal immigrants aren't stealing jobs that require at least 6 months of education, a few years of experience, and a license. 
t1_dswv3to	0	*	Nope. Can't control the economy if you have a free flow of goods and workers going through the border. This is part of the reason why the Soviets built the Iron Curtain border wall. 
t1_dsv4oyf	0	*	Wtf? Who doesn't like onions?
t1_dsvw0u6	0	*	In other words, you're prepared to pay more so that these companies can hire workers, the workers get paid more for minimum wage type jobs and also support Trump. Interesting...
t1_dswfy2n	0	*	That is looking at just the employee rate at those restraints. We are talking material increases (2 all beef patties, special, lettuce, cheese) and the labor that supports that.  
t1_dsuurb6	1	*	What's the racism?  Canada is a better country than Mexico. Is that racist?   Canada is a very diverse country. Which race am I favoring or hating on?
t1_dsvxs9k	0	*	Don't get rid of people, get rid of the laws that makes it impossible to negotiate pay and benefits. 
t1_dsw2ro5	0	*	Shit, you're right. Sorry. That was just a total misread on my part. 
t1_dsv58z4	1	*	Link is not dead, it loads fine. 
t1_dsvvd8m	0	*	Ya, I don't agree with that at all. If something is broken, fix it.  Just resigning yourself to, this is broken and is gonna be hard to fix for other people so I give up is shitty.
t1_dsuv6hw	0	*	I might not shower if I'm just gonna be home all day, why are you so interested in the time I spend naked? What're you fucking gay?
t1_dsuuc83	1	*	You've come up with enough brain-buster ideas for the both of us, I'm silent in awe.
t1_dsuuxkj	1	*	Time to change the subject again!  Second time you've done it now. I'd talk with you some more but I'm sure if we ever got anywhere in the conversation you'd just change the topic again.
t1_dsuxx7g	0	*	Now I am confused too. I think the original guy meant 'words' the incredulous guy thought 'country'. 
t1_dsuw8an	1	*	who is exploited here? the average annual income in Haiti is $350.
t1_dsw15hk	1	*	For fucks sake.  You need a hobby.
t1_dsvqglg	0	*	You want them to be accountable? Yeah that's bullshit 
t1_dsvwsaf	1	*	He said stagnating in the last two years.  It's on your chart.  It's the dip right there before Trump took office.
t1_dszu2m2	1	*	Congrats on not realizing the difference between defending the world economy and describing it. 
t1_dsv7jes	1	*	It's part of our selection criteria if you are thought to potentially overstay you won't be aproved. 
t1_dswmszf	1	*	I'm now convinced I'm talking to a person who needs a doctor.
t1_dsuvmln	0	*	When he banned the Haitians, but not Germans, he is showing he prefers Germans over Haitians.   It doesn't have to be a statement from his mouth...
t1_dsv6dr1	1	*	If your job can be stolen by someone with way less education than you and who doesnt even speak English, you have to admit its not really the governments problem anymore.
t1_dt03tkk	0	*	Thought so. 
t1_dsvgmib	1	*	Or had the biggest recorded inauguration crowd? 
t1_dsuyrv8	1	*	Why cant they be from countries like Norway?
t1_dsyy47i	0	*	What does a a country with laws have to do with it? We were talking about *legal* immigration or temporary visas.
t1_dsuvke0	1	*	Yes but the joke is they had to be on them in the first place.
t1_dsw6ak9	1	*	Seriously though if that is supppsed to prove that all politics are identity politics I dont see how at all.
t1_dsvaibf	0	*	Actually shes pretty famous for having meltdowns   The best one being where she wrote and ENTIRE BOOK about how her failure is everyone's else's fault.... even President Obama's. 
t1_dsv6s8y	0	*	Who pays for it
t1_dsvd50p	0	*	What? His post is right above... Go read it again. 
t1_dsv1dkr	0	*	Hmm so why would I vote for Trump if I'm not white and educated? Am I a self loathing Uncle Tom? 
t1_dsvsdpd	0	*	Yes but in general it's a tedious job with a lot of hours for minimum wage.
t1_dsuzzix	1	*	Again, instead of arguing against the point you play the racism card.  Let me ask you this then? If I say that the average education of someone from Canada is better than Mexico, is that racist?
t1_dsvbxbr	1	*	Deceptively difficult question this one; do you think there is still a need for emergency emigration from Haiti, specifically due to the earthquake 8 years ago?
t1_dsv5755	0	*	Unless it's a history of stupid comments, not racism. In that case, you'd be making a huge presumption, and the premise of your context would be totally flawed.
t1_dswnqs6	0	*	Bro, they literally stole everything from the people they conquered. They ripped out gold teeth from the people they killed. It was all blood money. 
t1_dsw4pmb	0	*	That's totally not true. There is a vetting system for immigrants, we actually do know a good deal about them
t1_dsw8emn	0	*	So you are saying minimal wage across the board should be that 18-20$/hour? 
t1_dsuw7c1	0	*	everyone knows this is a non story thats why it doesnt have legs.
t1_dsvxuut	0	*	You can't actually say that's the same logic because analogies require a comparison. Can't ask me what I meant while trying to draw a comparison to what I meant.
t1_dsv91ya	1	*	You're being downvotes because you are blatantly, factually wrong, and so is your link.
t1_dsw9oee	0	*	Except they're not since whites are proportionally represented, it's blacks and Asians who are under-represented. So...do you have a different take now, or nah?
t1_dsux7kd	0	*	Haha alright buddy go paint your warhammer toys. Grow up and learn to have an adult conversation. 
t1_dsv86wt	1	*	You're comparing slang words to a word that has been well defined for literally centuries. I don't know how else I can explain this to you. You're wrong.
t1_dsvccxe	1	*	Ive witnessed people crossing first hand. Do I need to have a verified journalist from FoxNews or CNN report this before its considered legitimate?
t1_dsvenuw	1	*	I think hes one of those San Francisco diversity warriors, talking about doing stuff that will only affect other people, lets both go back to the Botsnikov train so we can plot our next infiltration.
t1_dsvc2tj	1	*	https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Dickens
t1_dsvtb8p	0	*	>new Trump Republican brand has absorbed all the best philosophies from the left   HAHAHAHAHA FUCK I'm literally dead.  Thanks for laugh, man.   
t1_dsyzpuo	1	*	I never said I disagreed with you. 
t1_dsush5t	1	*	That's up for debate - it doesn't have to be all or nothing. But if we're just talking about 20 people, why bother cutting it at all? It feels unnecessary and spiteful.
t1_dsux81e	0	*	I like this guy  Comfortable is not a feeling I would ascribe to the Trump presidency but I'm speaking for myself
t1_dsvagi7	0	*	Too bad discriminating against people over 40 isn't constitutional.  We might not have a senile president if his senile supporters couldn't vote in elections they are incapable of understanding.
t1_dt66r6x	0	*	I don't think I follow at this point.   Who is not saying something is false and who are They when you say they are using vague terms?
t1_dtu1zwn	0	*	Because without free speech, it isnt even possible to arrive at anything. Free speech is the very mechanism through which we can determine anything about what we believe and value as a society. 
t1_dswi787	0	*	trillions on credit....  Obama reduced the war department spending.  say it again.
t1_dsw5ufl	1	*	> He was afraid and paranoid that the judge would be biased and try to retaliate against him  Solely on the grounds of the judge's race.

t1_dsvme7j	0	*	I'm not a fan of any of them antifa, Klan, or Nazi s they all act the same. I'm not defending them I'm just saying the presidents first statement was im sure they're fine people. 
t1_dsvu49l	0	*	Mexico is considered a developed country 
t1_dskij0w	0	*	I literally answered your question in my previous post. Scroll up and read it (and comprehend it) again.
t1_dskjg04	1	*	Amen to that.
t1_du0y3yi	1	*	life's a never-ending meal!
t1_du0vqsl	0	*	Anecdotal evidence is the best basis for a good argument. You may as well be saying smoking isn't bad for you, I've smoked literally tens of thousands of cigarettes and I've got no health problems
t1_dsoksqp	0	*	Look up the definition of pressured.
t1_dsxas1u	0	*	There is a thing called google. Use it.
t1_dsy6htl	1	*	Easy for you to say. Im assuming youve served in the military or something similar then? Youve been put in a position to risk your life, or several thousand lives, on an unknown? 
t1_dt024rx	0	*	k, commies please kill yourselves
t1_dsxkjey	0	*	It weakened Nazi Germany, the occupying force of Poland.

t1_dsi4m47	0	*	There security council did not actually authorize force against Afghanistan, they said terrorism was bad but that's it and multiple NATO members went to Iraq. 
t1_dsgsw3b	0	*	Do you think in actual trials ALL possibilities are taken into account?  I think you are missing the point, not even comically, by the way.
t1_dsgsw6s	0	*	I've seen everything from grainy 240p to crisp 4k video coming from America.  I could say the same about a lot of countries actually, but it's irrelevant to this discussion. 
t1_dsh24wp	1	*	So you can provide examples right?
t1_dsip6x9	0	*	Now you're making hypotheticals. Using American examples doesn't work in your favor in this argument.
t1_dsihye4	0	*	who is an overzealous nationalist? i think its pretty reasonable for most indians to misunderstand iranian-indian.

t1_dsstg6d	0	*	I suspect it's not been taken down because it generates traffic and there's no legal requirement to take it down.
t1_dt40cf4	0	*	And the peaceful, unarmed Syrian people fought 6 years against this evil dictatiorship ... Nice. So they did beat the Americans in terms of protesting.
t1_dt40aa2	0	*	So tell me why Mr. Xi Xiaoxing was arrested?
t1_dt431d9	0	*	Clearly more than that for your case.
t1_dtg999z	1	*	Then try to convince your State to do that, since they can allocate their votes however they want.
t1_dtg8uhn	1	*	The person youre arguing with has some states rights fetish that they think takes precedence over the will of the American people. Just ignore them. 
t1_dtgduj5	1	*	Oh shit did not see that.
t1_dtgjsiq	1	*	Bullshit. You've been in here calling everyone young and clueless without much substance for hours.
t1_dtgjfnu	1	*	>Are you just going to use that as a deflection every time you're proven wrong?  It's just him following the dear leader's glorious example.
t1_dthkjne	1	*	I got you. I felt like I was coming off a little 'holier than thou' and that just isn't me so I was a bit apprehensive lol.
t1_dtgoqu6	0	*	The popular vote reflects the sentiment of a majority of Americans.  It might not impact the outcome but saying it doesn't matter is the same as saying you don't care what Americans want. 
t1_dthebk2	0	*	$70k for a 2-story house?  *own* a house? I'll fight a fucking lion for that.

t1_dtm32s6	0	*	Wow is this some kind of cult or something? A few of you are really getting defensive for some reason.
t1_dteo4tl	1	*	And they say abortion is murder? We should get /u/nachTUNG a job in a clinic! He'd be doing god's work stopping heretics and apostates from having kids!
t1_dttxk8x	0	*	What are you quoting? Hes saying the world as we know it will be destroyed, it doesnt have to mean the planet is broken into pieces. If everyone is in a greement then what is the problem? 
t1_dtuhgw5	0	*	There are only three ideals of communism and none of the countries on that list uphold a single one of them.
t1_dtu2b7q	0	*	he didnt even say planet through all of what i read, he said world, which could easily mean the world we experiemce, the surface dominated by the biosphere 
t1_dtty5ze	0	*	Nah, it works fine for anyone that knows how to read well

t1_dsa03ht	0	*	How is it the same? You could eat the same animal that has already been killed. Why kill another? 
t1_dsa4rqq	0	*	No. Because we are animals and that's what animals do. 
t1_dsac76l	0	*	Try to maybe see things from others perspectives maybe 
t1_dsa0j2a	1	*	Not featured anywhere near as much as the other contestants and they don't get included in the group shots. I would be surprised if they weren't paid.
t1_dsb1zv8	1	*	I've never heard her speak.  She was part of an article I saw while fact checking a different one, and I was surprised because I'd just never known that, so i threw her on the list.
t1_dsafztk	1	*	If that's what you want to believe you're entitled to your opinion of course.
t1_dsa7072	0	*	If you don't like argument, why are we still talking? Seems like you're the source of the rude energy you're perceiving.

t1_duc187p	0	*	all you have heard is negativity I not going to lie and say that there will not be negatives along the way. But overall we are better off leaving its that simple.
t1_duaht3b	1	*	How is this story not being reported? It honestly explains everything.
t1_duapkpb	1	*	But what about the Dyson sphere? :(
t1_duacq1l	0	*	People voted them in on the promise of a referendum, we had a referendum and decided to leave, so now we are leaving? this is how democracy works. 
t1_dua54h7	1	*	Give it a rest, I couldn't care less about your doubts.  Browse again, though. Your main statement is terribly wrong.
t1_duai6l4	1	*	Haha cheers I'll check back in with ya in a few years. 
t1_ds3csj5	0	*	I'm not
t1_dur2hiq	0	*	Thanks for proving that you are unable to come up with any quotes from Trump that are more offensive than Hillary.

t1_dteas1n	1	*	sure buddy, my bad you are obviously very pleasant to those you interact with no matter how right you are.
t1_dtqh3am	0	*	I guess you vote by how people offend you versus actual policy, I don't. 
t1_dtdxt6s	0	*	Lol. We'll see who is babbling when everyone starts flipping on Trump to avoid federal prison. I have plenty of  popcorn ready. It's going to be a very interesting year.
t1_dsgsvy1	0	*	Yep, I agree. Even for legit targets, like IDF and settlers, there shouldn't be any financial remuneration. No military works like that.
t1_dsu5lhq	1	*	I felt he was very misinformed about the amendment, and frankly, his behaviour didnt exactly convince me that *everyone* should have the right to bear arms.
t1_dsu5meb	1	*	I also felt he was somewhat misinformed in that regard.
t1_dsv1owh	1	*	> Drop a postcard to yourself in the mail if you go on vacation  I love this idea! 
t1_dstsn4n	1	*	Ah, bugger. Oh well, it makes the speculation fun I suppose :-)
t1_dstj14i	1	*	I have watched those, but I obviously didn't remember them very well. A good excuse (as if it were necessary) to watch them again :-)
t1_dsu9033	0	*	Thank you, i think Im just having a good day though. For example, you dont want to catch me on a brexit thread :-)  
t1_dspj9y7	1	*	I am not sure and I cannot seem to find good numbers.  I can find numbers for reported crimes and for convictions, but I'd really like to have indictments as well.
t1_dusr75i	0	*	Massacring civilians and prisoners isn't great though. How many German soldiers survived capture after Stalingrad? Of the hundreds of thousands of German prisoners, how many made it home? 
t1_dszfd5c	0	*	Doesn't matter, what matters is the content...  The moon king I mean, your thing is nonsense.  (Has anyone else noticed that dodgy accounts always call people kid who they disagree with?)
t1_dsqpnwr	0	*	If you are not diversifying your portfolio, it might be because you have nothing to diversify, in which case this discussion is pointless.
t1_dt949ps	0	*	Canada unemployment is higher than US and by number of people the difference is staggering.  Let the minimum wage kick in and the people earning it are cheaper to replace.

t1_dt6os4s	1	*	When did I say I don't want them around me
t1_dt6wgj4	0	*	You didn't. We're talking about our descendants and I asked in what way are we changing their country so radically, like you claimed.  Well?
t1_dt6o4oy	0	*	Its not irrational, wanting to protect your culture isn't irrational. 
t1_dt6s9o3	1	*	You posted a clearly wrong statement (The Nazis were socialist) and are surprised that more than one person calls you out, and then somehow jump to the conclusion that they're alt-accounts.

t1_duqslz2	0	*	We're talking about culture and reality, not policy. We're having different conversations. 
t1_durmecx	0	*	Oh I see, you are actually the stupid uneducated American who doesn't understand the difference between its and it's. No wonder you guys voted in Trump.

t1_dsn9kxh	0	*	Dear God you don't even know, you are so insulated.
t1_dsnfdnu	0	*	No it was 2x the amount that Trump paid for at a bankruptcy auction.  You do not pay market value at even lower level housing auction sales.
t1_dsmpmgf	0	*	You brought up precedent....
t1_dsn5yta	1	*	Lol racism is bigotry against a race not a country. You cant make up definitions to suit you at will. But again, the remarks dont relate to Haitian race, just their culture 
t1_dsobwpg	0	*	Point out where is that with proper sources? 
t1_dsoiana	0	*	I'm not getting paid for this, so I'll leave this debate to those of you that are.

t1_duffsjp	0	*	And I'm wrong?
t1_dtsaqhk	0	*	But how is a hero? it's a shame he wasn't able to shoot his way out though.   you and Beo1 could have taken turns thanking him when he got back
t1_dumfyqj	0	*	Because you say the USS Liberty sinking was a deliberate attack. If it really was, a retaliation would only be appropriate.
t1_dt59m7s	0	*	Because they have better conditions and pay better?
t1_dt5toba	1	*	Lightly played Mexico
t1_dt578d8	1	*	I'm sure that at that point (not that I think it's an actual possibility), the ultra-wealthy won't experience any difficulty eradicating the rest of us.
t1_dt787ux	1	*	In your examples, you complete skip over the preposition of.  That's the whole point.
t1_dt58kl1	1	*	Don't get me wrong, I'm pro-automation.  I just wish people would focus more on those removed from their positions by advancements in technology so I'm bitter lol
t1_dt5juq4	1	*	Nah it's just bad pasta

t1_dt66i85	1	*	It works fine, but if they can't compete, they can build a factory in the US and keep everything a trade secret.
t1_dt5n20i	0	*	That's odd to only use US companies for a top 3 when it's rather VW Toyota and... I'd say GM?
t1_dt6dnbm	1	*	You're a creative one. Keep racing to the bottom.
t1_dt60jka	0	*	No. Just because I get a Netflix bill, that doesn't mean I *need* Netflix.

t1_dt5ipwr	0	*	Wait, what is New Amsterdam now?
t1_dt5d0zt	1	*	Can vouch for that, just moved from the Plains. I think they had the highest average of millionaires for a while too but Im sure Mountain Brook owns that spot now

t1_du4u0r7	0	*	I am proud to say I have not even once visited Breitbart and, reluctantly, voted for Hillary. After I voted for Bernie in the primary.  I can dislike both Trump and Hillary. Fuck your gatekeeping.

t1_du4zfcd	1	*	Didn't this happen in Poland in a plane crash a few years back?
t1_dser247	0	*	I never offered a defense.  Getting you to prove your argument is not defending what you were arguing against.  Try and work on your basic logic and reasoning ability.

t1_dsnglgo	0	*	you read facts but when i tell you one you say I mean, duh? great reader
t1_dsn79w0	1	*	You just said they cost more than xa340 an hour. That's a lot of money.
t1_dt8wjvz	0	*	Than why, if you do agree there is such disparity, shouldn't wealthy  people be taxed more?   Keep in mind, many wealthy people are born into it and didnt work a day in their lives for it.

t1_dv2dciz	1	*	An American cop can not arrest you for hurting his or her feelings.  Just an example of how our free speech laws are superior.
t1_dv3h39d	1	*	Well, in my country (EU) that would certainly be illegal, because in this case a victim's right to privacy or dignity is considered to prevail over the right of public to be informed.

t1_dsi71dn	1	*	I'm the bitch, yet you're the one with the hurt butt....interesting rational.
t1_dsl4vtl	0	*	Is it your position that Russia did not interfere in the American election?
t1_dshz0kg	0	*	The topic is Russia. Your first sentence in this little bit is this:  >You realize we elect new Presidents regularly, and the 70s was 40+ years ago? The 80s were 30+ years ago.  *yawn*
t1_dsi0stb	0	*	Civil rights granted from up high are a fiction respected by *no* power. Our police and our economy are wholly set up to shred civil rights.
t1_dsi5sm0	0	*	We can share some knowledge :)
t1_dsix85u	0	*	And you would say the same thing and back him up if Trump were to tell others off for being corrupt or sexist or whatever?
t1_dslv1ds	1	*	No, we've been talking about the /s
t1_dsizft3	1	*	Right, you were calling america brainwashed but totally not in a condescending way. Have a great day.
t1_dtkensf	0	*	Facts are that the violence goes both ways. What you're doing is called hyperbole.    A body count scoreboard isn't a measure of anything except for military prowess. 
t1_dsasf8o	0	*	That's doesn't matter. Migration is a *privilege* not a *right*.
t1_dssi8ny	0	*	One can be very well educated on a topic, as Sam is regarding religion, yet not have a named degree. 
t1_dsslemh	1	*	Would you agree that Zuckerberg is an expert on computer programming and networking though? I'd contend that he is.
t1_dstsve7	0	*	 >cheat codes  LoL cheat codes? More like blowing shit up and hoping things get better. The occupations were far more like COD then RTS.    
t1_dst68z1	1	*	Yes obviously i never claimed they didn't

t1_dsteuxa	0	*	No the Quran.
t1_dsscpgl	1	*	Lacking classical education does not preclude someone being knowledgeable. So I repeat, your criticism seems very vague and ill defined. 
t1_dt92r7b	1	*	Wow, someone holding back their opinions on topics that they don't feel fully qualified to opine on.  Damn, is this still the internet?  Good on you.
t1_du4753h	1	*	k
t1_du4d4lb	1	*	... one in the shin?
t1_du54738	0	*	No, they gathered in force. The military/police refused to shoot their own citizens - government collapses. You havent read much history I guess?
t1_du4sh3v	0	*	What if a Russian oligarch paid some pathetic fatty to spread disinformation to change public opinion in a foreign country's election?
t1_dsbiods	0	*	> HRC is fake as f.  True, but mostly an outcome of being excoriated after being open as the first lady of Arkansas. Politics molds politicians as much as anything.
t1_duj86sm	0	*	> Biblical miracles are no different.  So you believe.  Its all about faith when it comes to things you haven't seen, that can't be tested.
t1_duhw7xo	0	*	Christianity got them from Judaism. Which is why I said JudeaChristian.  No, I went to private schools but none were affiliated with any religions.
t1_ds5byip	1	*	Gotcha
t1_ds683xv	0	*	Yes, cops uphold white supremacy
t1_ds7v5nl	0	*	Tell yes, that's because the U.S. chain gangs tended to be located in a subtropical climate - so they probably heated to death or were whipped to death (yes seriously).
t1_ds8y7hg	1	*	Right, Russia sucks. I agree. But BanzaiTree is ignoring America's history, and it's disgusting.

t1_ds55g6a	0	*	Blame who am I blaming and what of?
t1_ds4uzgg	0	*	You must be a lowlife cop.  Or even worse, someone with a unremarkable life, that sadly worships authority, and has a disgusting hero fetish.   Edit: you are a wrestling fan. It all makes sense now. 
t1_ds5273m	1	*	Sorry, quite wrong on the age.  Like you said, confirmation bias and all that. People see what they expect to see.
t1_ds5hksa	0	*	The conversation became tiresome but if you want to claim some moral victory then by all means, be my guest U0001f44f
t1_ds54wm1	1	*	Yeah I'm not sure what liberals have to do with anything. Dude is off the rails
t1_ds50psx	0	*	If I had to identify someone who hates the civil rights movements of the 1960s, I'd say it's the person comparing them to the tantrums and buffoonery of Occupy and the Tea Party.

t1_ds4vhtx	1	*	Yes. Its the only way they can make their argument reasonable. 
t1_ds54bfd	0	*	You must be new here... threads literally never stay on topic on Reddit. Some dude posted a thread a while back showing how often Nazis are brought up. It's like half of all threads or some shit. 
t1_ds5e7j9	1	*	Well, physical confrontations between large groups of people will probably result in a few injuries. If that's too big a risk, don't trespass on other people's property. 
t1_dsuliok	0	*	Loathe means hate, FYI. Did you mean love? 
t1_dsum0mm	0	*	Look, we have a difference of opinion on military service. But you will agree its not an easy job and they deserve, at least, some respect? 
t1_dswap4d	1	*	GDP grew at a stagnant less than 2% throughout his presidency. Growth rate was stagnant. 
t1_dsum982	1	*	All fair points. I have not served. Have family who have. I respect their service, but I don't grovel at their feet in adoration. 
t1_dsug9o3	0	*	Likewise, I really want America to succeed and for you to see it! 
t1_dsukwfy	0	*	Actually Steele was funded by Republicans doing opposition research until Trump won the nomination, then Democrats took over the funding. 
t1_dsuvauk	0	*	Here you are again, squawking the tabloidisms. Are you considering politics as a competitive game?  
t1_dsvp9rl	0	*	GDP was flat for all eight years of prior admin. GDP growth is now accelerating due to Presidents policy. It is clearly visible. Voters are noticing.
t1_dsun3fs	1	*	Fine.   Islam still isnt one of them. cannibalism and murder? Those at least can be considered  Islam is a religion. It doesn't force you to murder people or rape, or cannibalize, or torture. 
t1_dsumcnk	0	*	People have evolving views. We all change. President is not exempt from those normal evolutions in thinking.   
t1_dtrgqh5	0	*	No of course not, re-read my post you aren't comprehending what I wrote.
t1_dtrfnd7	0	*	No country individually. Combined, some might. But other than that, what do you do? I never said it was equitable. 
t1_dtr1h77	0	*	The Partition Plan was never enacted.  
t1_dts28y9	0	*	Actually that was written by an indigenous Canadian Metis (not Jewish) who just happens to know how to recognize indigeneity when he sees it.
t1_ds3exsd	0	*	Its conversation, and that's a cop out answer.
t1_ds53ux7	0	*	maybe you should go read the conversation again i'm pretty sure you are not really paying attention 
t1_dt7v623	0	*	So you can source it right? How food she say they fixed it again? Does the election data even support that if she did?
t1_dt62fvv	0	*	its all redacted out. Read the 99 page memo released by the FISA court like I did. 
t1_dt71crx	0	*	Thank you for showing your true intellect with that comment. 
t1_dt6aeiw	0	*	It was clear that the DNC was backing her even in the primaries as the favorite. Either way she was a shit candidate that had no business running in the first place and now we have Trump.

t1_dt90of9	0	*	While you were full of shit I was sharpening my aim.
t1_dt71t7b	0	*	Already did. You're not willing or capable of understanding it though. Which is of course why you're a Trump supporter. 
t1_dt5xwcg	1	*	I was being sarcastic....
t1_dt6a4bo	0	*	You're the one that said the noose is tightening for Trump, but provide no legitimate reason why that is.  Don't worry I'll be at the Donald because I enjoy winning.
t1_dt62je5	0	*	You're latching onto one statement, as if human beings are locked into one strict point of view and can't clarify their thoughts.  It was obvious hyperbole.  
t1_dt6ajtb	0	*	No, evidence cannot just be fabricated. To claim that is to invalidate almost every court case ever.
t1_dt9tprj	0	*	Its so sad that you think your country's military will attack it's citizens, and sad that you are trying to be condescending to a stranger on the internet.
t1_dt6mr4m	0	*	Show me your proof. Why hasnt Trump been charged if theyve found any hard evidence on him? Im guessing you are speculating.
t1_dt6p6tb	1	*	Fallacy definitions aren't literal. Holy shit are you dense... 
t1_dt5xehk	0	*	you keep talking about reddit like it's a person. *you're* posting on Reddit right now... so apparently reddit is very cynical.
t1_dt5v2hm	0	*	If you're not able to understand any of the subtext you shouldn't bother thinking about any sort of policy decisions.
t1_dt6pvsx	0	*	It's just based around the fact that all the old people who are voting are not going to be around to face the consequences of their actions.
t1_dt9hu1a	0	*	I hate public health !
t1_dt9pw83	0	*	quality humor man :) we read your comments aloud with friends at the bar yesteday. You were getting realy nice laughs!
t1_dt5xxre	0	*	You are correct. I thought touting a $200 bump was sarcastic enough in nature. But these days you cant be so sure. 
t1_dt6y3xq	0	*	Source on obstruction of justice and money laundering? 
t1_dt5wu1k	1	*	He was considered the greatest legal mind and prosecutor of our generation before Trump was elected. Let that settle in for a minute.
t1_dt6riks	1	*	Oh, got it. Cool, thanks. Agreed. He's being extra snowflaky.
t1_dv4sp6x	0	*	Let me correct you.  Russian troops invaded Ukraine when the people of Ukraine overthrew the puppet president that Russia installed.  NATO exists to protect real democracies.
t1_dv4d0ix	0	*	Ah yes, as we've seen in the past 
t1_ds4fjul	1	*	Incontinentia... BUTTOCKS!
t1_dsiggpe	1	*	Nope, they didn't.
t1_dsho950	0	*	The US military interventions in the middle east actively cause more human suffering than they prevent.
t1_dsj4jkm	1	*	Yeah you might not sound like a clown in that case.
t1_du0mh6o	0	*	It's more like an alleged john's lawyer contesting the allegation because he has photographic evidence of the police chief sleeping with the prostitute.
t1_dtyh55l	0	*	What statements? What is paying... Fusion? Who are you saying is lying,  and where is your proof he is lying? Please be clearer, if you are onto something we should all know. 
t1_dsl9re6	0	*	To add to this: lets take the shithole comment for example. It got reported. He denied it. A democratic senator confirmed it. A republican senator confirmed it. Trump is a lying piece of trash. 
t1_dslc67y	1	*	Lol. Touche
t1_dsl93c6	0	*	Interesting. Was just curious as to why the sudden fervent interest from this account the past six months, yet nothing before that. Thanks for clearing that up.
t1_dut390a	1	*	Agreed. I mean, who else is going to stand up in the ioc's defense? China? 
t1_dsvjc5t	1	*	You didn't ask about NATO, you said Europe.
t1_dttf33p	0	*	Yeah, the point is nobody EVER mentions the Egyptian blockade of Gaza. They only ever mention the Israeli blockade.
t1_dttc67c	0	*	You dont know how wars and countries work do you? 
t1_dttfnq0	0	*	So just don't invite them to the Olympics?
t1_dttxcnz	0	*	Kinda. Without trust, all that's left is might.
t1_dtuisx6	0	*	they can say what they like, it is what it is
t1_dtv5rd2	0	*	That's not a blockade. 
t1_dtvav09	0	*	So you dont acknowledge that Israel would be destroyed if they didnt fight, while the Arabs would thrive more than in the last few decades if they stopped fighting and were willing to forge peace. 
t1_dtsmoeo	1	*	but they're making more of themselves, as humans do.  
t1_dtwjs3f	0	*	Yes, by Israel mostly. If you are under occupation voting hardly gives you a real democracy, because to have a democracy you actually need a state.   So, yeah, a shitty situation for them. 
t1_dtsu4sc	0	*	But there already existed Jewish Military forces. Do you not believe that article?
t1_ds3u9ty	0	*	Ploy? No no, I just want you to be open with how you truly feel.
t1_duwv9cw	0	*	The intent is different, though. Ever law limits your freedom, rights and possesions in some way, but that doesn't make them punishment. Even investigative custody of suspects isn't punishment.
t1_dux82m5	0	*	>Spouse A is convincted  >Children are removed from spouse B  >Spouse B is investigated  Spouse B's same-day interview goes fine, and children are returned safely.
t1_dtqa9ot	1	*	Well that's a shitty response to finding out you're wrong.
t1_dsa38rq	1	*	Yeah, I was done after that.  I engage in some of these things so there isn't a single narrative posted for those unfamiliar with the situation.
t1_dsc4y6l	1	*	Yeah, the fledgling democracy that wanted to go communist during the cold war. Excellent example there. 
t1_dsb99f5	1	*	Have you ever heard of voter suppression? Actively trying to ensure that not all voices are equally heard?   https://people.howstuffworks.com/voter-suppression1.htm 
t1_dsb5qgz	1	*	I'm going to say probably not.
t1_dsbbn8f	0	*	But....maps.

t1_dsfz1az	1	*	Lol what sources?
t1_dsc9v1t	0	*	Wow.  Dude I'm not even american but thanks for proving this...  > But then reason seems to go out the window when it comes to analysing Trump's words with many folk.  ...so immediately.
t1_dsc9np8	0	*	Wait who's dick? This IS an article about Trump, and you are commenting on the article. Who is you guys? I'm not even a Democrat.
t1_dsb4t68	1	*	You didn't make a dispute though. You said you're wrong and provided another claim. You answered a question with a question, basically.
t1_dsb4mu6	1	*	HA! I literally have a print-out of a chart for that site in my office at work. 
t1_dscrp2s	0	*	Too intellectually challenging to understand my post, eh?
t1_dsbale1	1	*	> You are making shit up  Someone here is, but it's not that other guy.
t1_dsbc7s9	0	*	So again, commenting when you aren't American about US immigration policy? You must be an illegal, don't worry, we'll round you up too. Good day too
t1_dsb8rq2	0	*	Again, does the US have a need for millions/billions of poor unskilled labor? NO, now come on, you can came up with a better argument than that
t1_dtxjesx	0	*	I didnt claim anything. Were talking about *your* claim that barely half of the uk is English.
t1_dtykfhh	0	*	You are making opposite statements.   Was the thread about the angloshere or the commonwealth? Depends what situation you want me to be wrong in.
t1_dtxnmpu	0	*	nah bro do the needful
t1_dty20d9	1	*	It literally say country of birth.
t1_dtxhjzh	0	*	Everyone is likely to immigrate....
t1_dty9p4w	1	*	I know man... The ones who never left India don't know much about Europe in general. That is why I didn't want to continue the discussion. Thanks for your response!
t1_dtxe831	0	*	James Brooke was Rajah of Sarawak, imagine owning a country 
t1_dtxhqir	0	*	What about sports? What about language? What about food? What about the law? You see... I think you don't know much about Poland and Europian history. That's it. I'm ending this discussion.
t1_dtyfmoe	0	*	Wow name calling now? Ironic that you're calling someone else a fool.  
t1_dtxpmhk	0	*	I'm not going into specific details about myself, sorry. 
t1_dty41cx	1	*	You need an army to enforce that, you could have legal ownership over the white house. You ain't getting shit...
t1_dtxhjwo	0	*	What specifically did I say that scared you so much?
t1_dtzo5wd	1	*	Ok. Assuming everyone in Scotland, Wales and NI were born in the UK, the absolute min for UK births in England is 45 million, more than half England's 0opulation.
t1_dtxhbxa	0	*	>and?  The only way he managed to become educated, Christian and free to campaign like that is due to he colonial efforts of Britain 
t1_dtycpb4	0	*	Ya but you'd have freedom of movement from it joining the EU anyway,  so your choice is either compete with Germany and France in a few years, or try and get them all a little early. 
t1_dswptjx	0	*	They value the mother, not the fetus. The fetus is worthless until its born. 
t1_dswq4fp	0	*	Are dogs worthless? No. They just aren't a person.  You're bad at this, dude. 
t1_dswq9ps	0	*	So you aknowledge that they are human being yet you still think we should able to kill them.
t1_dswvmkl	0	*	Yes.
t1_dsx30kx	0	*	You don't have to like it for it to be effective.
t1_dsyfrjt	0	*	Aww, so youre young at heart while you ignorantly ignore the realities of the abortion issue?  Good for you, champ!  Have fun calling people baby killers, mr high ground. 
t1_dswpcpj	0	*	Hypothetically, you'd be ok with aborting a 3rd trimester fetus? What about a fetus who is a day away from being born?
t1_dswvf5k	0	*	do you honestly think that? because at best it was a straw-man. ask me an actual question.
t1_dsx5on5	0	*	Why do you guys never understand what strawman means?  
t1_dsxrjzb	0	*	Ah yes, the completely unscientific idea that a baby in the womb isn't alive. Takes a special kind of stupid to believe that. 
t1_dswo3ex	0	*	YES. IT'S A DIFFERENT STORY. Rights were never the issue, this was always about choices. I now regret having come into this thread and trying to reason with a tidal wave of hysteria.
t1_dswruux	0	*	You are sick
t1_dswroba	1	*	But it's not really worthy of an answer, that's the point.   Godspeed, though!
t1_dswlq00	0	*	Nice job taking the moral high ground there <3
t1_dswjnkr	0	*	They weren't employed by the city.
t1_dswpb3o	0	*	You asked for no feelings I gave you no feelings haha
t1_dsx0xnr	1	*	You didnt answer my question about abortion or explain how these doctors and scientists are being vague. 
t1_dsz3vpn	0	*	Your question has no relevance to the discussion, as the point wasn't about in vitro abortion but about abortion being a concern for those with a uterus.
t1_dswjmqd	1	*	My bad. Sorry.
t1_dsxxypg	0	*	same at uni, very boring lectures
t1_dsxbevn	0	*	You're the one with straw man arguments.  You fail to support your claims time and time again.  Go back to your basement.  
t1_dswrokj	0	*	I consider it a human life upon conception and thats why I dont support legal abortion
t1_dswoevm	0	*	Ah I see. So you think abortion is ok sometimes?
t1_dswun0s	0	*	If it is easily changed then it should be treated like any other law, not the supreme law
t1_dswoq98	0	*	If you swap that m to a t that's a good description of you.
t1_dsy1dwu	0	*	Can you describe in what way.
t1_dswuem2	0	*	What if I came to Canada, became a citizen for healthcare and got big fake titties for no reason at all. Would you be happy to pay for that?
t1_dswn4cy	0	*	So if there was a law that says homosexuality was wrong, you'd argue that there *should* be a law against homosexuality, because there was a law that said homosexuality was wrong?
t1_dszkvj0	0	*	They are not promoting aboriton, they are promoting the banning of abortion.   Are you not understanding that on purpose? 
t1_dswlp24	1	*	Wow, where did you take your degree?
t1_dswo4cw	1	*	True. Just wanted to comment to show that I acknowledge what you're saying.
t1_dsx1dh4	0	*	Eating without drinking is like an undressed wound.
t1_dswvm8v	1	*	No, it's morally reprehensible to claim that it is not a human life.
t1_dswprc5	0	*	Lmao. You proved nothing. 
t1_dsxgo3x	0	*	Lol you are very confused.
t1_dswpxx3	0	*	Its not a debate. Its settled forever. The court has ruled, there is no appeal. 
t1_dswyrsk	0	*	> The only time they could and therefore perhaps should is if said group has broken democratically passed laws.  Like when anti abortion groups threaten & harass staff members and visitors to clinics?
t1_dsxxy0s	0	*	sperm doesn't have full human dna. I am just defining terms. But yes, you can go to jail for murdering a dog but not for murdering a fetus, you are correct.
t1_dswphoe	0	*	What does the mandate of the group itself state? Are they interfering with the ability of others to excersize their rights? 
t1_dsxq06t	0	*	If you saw that, then why did you claim that they dropped off zero gifts? You're starting to look like a troll so I may abandon this conversation here.
t1_dsxfc3h	1	*	Thats fine, I'm not even saying your opinion is wrong. There's plenty of debate of what constitutes life. But I don't think the definition is as black and white as you make it out to be.
t1_dsy87r9	1	*	You could say it's almost the definition.
t1_dswyaqy	1	*	> should be removed  *can* be removed. A woman can also decode to carry the parasite to term so that it becomes a human being.
t1_dswpfom	0	*	And you're welcome to have that opinion.    I'm not going to open the can of worms about it being completely preventable. Thanks for your response.
t1_dsx6jqm	0	*	Yes and 95 percent of abortions are done in the first trimester
t1_dswrr6r	1	*	Making abortion legal leads to murdering children.  How is it moral for anyone to murder a child to avoid pregnancy?
t1_dswq2ug	0	*	You have very poor reading comprehension. You cannot be defunded for any personal belief. Mandates imply action. 
t1_dsx6qox	1	*	Because at that point I feel it's no longer just an extension of the women. 
t1_dswmt8y	0	*	At conception. By your logic a 5-year old is less of a person that a 20-year-old due to having less cells and relying more on their parents.
t1_dszn1sp	1	*	Yeah, as if Chretien never did the same thing when it suited him.  Or a previous Trudeau.  Or Mulroney.
t1_dsx21qi	0	*	So you get annoyed that people rightfully claim birth control works 98% of the time? And thats what makes you repeat the same thing? 
t1_dswpfrq	0	*	Youre using the most extreme example and pretending that this is the why all abortions happen
t1_dswpwpv	1	*	The Canadian Constitution, not the inferior American one. See the Supreme Court of Canadas rulings on the subject, in R v Morgentaler and Tremblay v Daigle.  
t1_dsz4wj6	0	*	You clearly have no idea what you are talking about, Ive made over $5,000 trading on that game and bought my first car in straight cash while in college with 0 debt. 
t1_dswpr0b	0	*	Have fun being inferior in every way, especially morally. 
t1_dswxm04	1	*	What the fuck...
t1_dsxfjys	0	*	So that is it? People are not aloud to peacefully protest without the government literally giving there opposition support?
t1_dswqi9j	0	*	But is autonomy of greater importance than life?
t1_dtcvd6b	1	*	Obama had a growing market? The crash in 08/09 was growth? Im not American so please help me out with that, thanks 
t1_dtg44tn	0	*	try what?
t1_ds3t7k4	0	*	You're just a salty lunatic. Stay in your safe dreams if you want, the world where you can nuance your way out with bullshit. 
t1_dusnyvg	1	*	Honestly you need to read a book because your definitions are fucking atrocious
t1_dusruiy	1	*	Where are you getting these definitions from?
t1_duuewjj	1	*	Oh, the wind was a wave of cactus dust, sepia specks flocking across the barren meadow, and it howled with pitying mockery at a flung-fistful of tenacious dandelions.
t1_duuy53a	1	*	no shit, they lost to mousesports! I didnt even bother watching that because I thought simple alone would wipe the floor with them not even counting how good edward and flamie have been playing
t1_duvnwmr	0	*	\> I come from a position of being informed   \> vox.com link      Good one.
t1_duy9jfo	0	*	What article? What planet are we on? I support transgender folks to be who they want to be, I'm just opposed to *compulsory speech* does that make sense?
t1_ds86p98	0	*	Did you read even the headline ?
t1_dta248f	0	*	Are you black or not? Answer the question, even though I already know the answer...
t1_dtabntz	0	*	She broke rules. Not laws.   Case dismissed.
t1_dt9f8vk	0	*	But it's that or a merciful quick death. That is reality, and the only two options that exist with current medical technology.
t1_dtfeo5h	0	*	Ah chest thump U0001f602
t1_dt9w9h4	1	*	At this point I think any historical trends are gonna be out the window. I have never seen the democratic base more motivated or pissed off than it is now. 
t1_dt9c08y	0	*	I suppose a physically exhausted lunatic *is* safer for society.   Thank you
t1_dt9fqtr	0	*	So youd abort.
t1_dtchjwh	1	*	I agree. The problem is not enough, not soon enough while almost everyone gets shafted.
t1_dt95xzd	0	*	Its funny you talk about critical thinking 
t1_dtbz6h2	0	*	> The discussion was about people who were being paid to do a job  They aren't paid. They reject the work. They are paid to do *other* things. 
t1_dteick3	0	*	I'm torn, because on one hand I feel sorry for you, but, at the same time, it is ultimately your actions and refusal to think critically that has put you into this hole.
t1_dt9hx58	0	*	Hahaha. The sound of defeat. 
t1_dta09ro	1	*	I was totally having an honest discussion, try not to be such an asshole.
t1_dt9i7wg	0	*	I wish I could say that he wasn't mine. :(
t1_dt9bu9n	0	*	Is ignoring questions you don't want to answer also a stage in the t_d Ten Step Program To Glory?
t1_dtax3w2	1	*	Fixed
t1_dtcll4g	0	*	Even the small minority that were anti slavery did nothing to stop it lol.   I predict in 10 years we'l be tearing down Washington/Jefferson statues tbh 
t1_ds3gz6d	0	*	Are you a human?
t1_dtqj1i3	1	*	Yes. Linguistic prescriptivism is fucking stupid, descriptivism is the only sane model.
t1_dtdnie6	1	*	Ok then you cant vet your media because you haven't done your own research. IAEA has stated there is no evidence Iran ever had a weapons program. 
t1_dtf6qfx	0	*	Can we not draw a distinction between terrorists that kill innocent people and the people that kill the terrorists? Seriously what's wrong with your compass?   And no. Bill O Reily got #metooed
t1_du69y7p	1	*	Please don't insult the great state of Alabama.
t1_du85qgz	0	*	As if Syria doesn't get help from Iran? Not to mention Russia.
t1_dtket75	0	*	It's not a recognised contraction, like the one at the start of this sentence.  Now why don't you stop arguing over grammar and address the point I made.
t1_duc5o8l	1	*	Look, I tried my best here. If you still don't get it, and you're back to attacking me with   strawmen, there's nothing more I can do.
t1_dukcy9d	0	*	ISIS didn't exist before the Nazi invasion into France.
t1_dv5gs2k	1	*	Was he playing or not and was he dating a 14 year old?  
t1_dsowz5h	1	*	Figuratively 
t1_dsqe561	1	*	He said what I said and all you said to me was reposted from your previous bull shit. Its obvious you have no rebuttal or other evidence besides that weak that was just torn apart. 
t1_dspnpt1	0	*	But I mean what else are we shoving facts into if not things we already believe?
t1_dspszuu	1	*	Hah, yeah you do not take any responsibility as an individual. But if there is enough of you, you will see to the *forcing* quite eagerly.
t1_dsqjw3a	0	*	So what's your point exactly?
t1_dthle5s	1	*	it's not the ap. they're reporting what the french intelligence agencies said. but the american intelligence agencies were totally telling the truth about iraqi wmds, etc so good for you ;)
t1_dsitl7t	0	*	Gonna need a source on that. 
t1_dsknd8u	1	*	Manipulation source is, two sources fimilar with the matter which means absolutely nothing.  Also how were they manipulated?
t1_dsjxwjv	1	*	Just trying to point out fake news. Not sure what agenda you are trying to misinform people with.
t1_dudzus5	0	*	Well pick a race then.  Whichever one popped into your head is the one you have the biggest problem with, I assume.  But knowing Parisians as I do, I know generally its hatred of Algerians.
t1_du4stx2	1	*	Thank you!
t1_dudrz7r	0	*	No you can't. I live in America, the land of the free. 
t1_duh169z	1	*	You discount the reach and effect of the campaign while casually passing it off, almost reluctantly, in the same paragraph.
t1_dufnq19	1	*	Just posting to say that's quite a believable scenario. But if it were to happen, it would never be made public by the South Koreans in order to preserve national stability.
t1_ds4giu2	0	*	There are always violent riots there for years. Oh do you mean how Israelis are barely allowed on to the Temple Mount?
t1_ds742wt	0	*	Donald?  Is that you?
t1_dth5ng8	0	*	That's stupid, counterprotesting is not going to the protest.
t1_dtgjbxq	1	*	Probably. The inherent threat he poses towards the LGBT community is always there, given his history and views.
t1_dtptxac	0	*	Theyre not completely different things.  Why are you dragging this out so long?
t1_dv4jd90	0	*	Bro, Mueller was chosen by *Republicans*. His investigation and criminal charges have nothing to do with the left. Lmao.
t1_dtbdo6h	1	*	So how long does it take?
t1_dt8ozkg	1	*	You are trying to pull words out of my mouth that arent mine. And I already said all non zionist are cool. That includes normal jews.
t1_dsgfs8l	1	*	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_Asian_Arabic  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khorasani_Arabic  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabs_in_Khorasan
t1_duonaar	1	*	No that's a valid point, I can see why you think that now. I don't think Godwin's law applies in this case because Nazism is a good example of oppressive standards taken to the extreme. 
t1_dunbk0s	0	*	Why do I even reply to people who don't have two braincells to rub together?  No one was asked to mutilate their genitals or stone a person. What the fuck are you even talking about?
t1_dunlfh0	0	*	No she's the head of government. The queen is the head of state. 
t1_dsyvmaz	1	*	You didn't debunk shit.  All you've said is some nonsense about how the American people don't have a say in politics.
t1_dsyl7si	0	*	Did you even read what I said?
t1_ds3eho5	0	*	You think criticism of israel equates to support of its neighbors?  There are a number of basket cases in that region. Israel is one of many  Haha
t1_ds2kje7	1	*	Nope, it's fact.
t1_dszl8ie	0	*	So he needs to make 8x his base employees wage?
t1_dszofid	0	*	So basically you're in the autistic tinfoil hat realm of ridiculousness.
t1_dsjjuhz	0	*	Sorry, let me rephrase. Have you actually watched that video that you linked? Because it doesn't support the concept of no-go zones at all. 
t1_dsjixpb	0	*	Yes. Yes it does. Trump's bigotry and racism was on full display for decades before the election.
t1_dsjx0z5	0	*	\>have right ideals wrong approach, cant use le meme arrows
t1_dsjapko	0	*	Give me cash. Yo. Do your part. Come on. 
t1_dsjjxyn	0	*	What about the unconstitutional wars and meddling that were perpetrated by Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama?  How about her voting for AUMF in Iraq?  Just a little boo boo?
t1_dsjji6t	1	*	Which many of us went happy about.   What a joke. Where were you the last 8 years? Didnt hear much from the many of us. 
t1_dsmqz1b	0	*	Most American conservatives are also socially libertarian.  
t1_dsjkqxq	1	*	What are you doing? Ill vote for you. Come on. Ill join you. Lemme see your track record. 
t1_dskul3q	0	*	Nope, don't care about America. Just pointing out that breaking laws can absolutely be the right course of action when democracy fails (eg Russia today)
t1_dsjbohh	0	*	You might be somewhat correct. I found two American girls at Teasers in Amsterdam and took them to Red light district, they did not like the show involving a girl and a banana 
t1_dsjl6pg	0	*	The part where you arrest and charge a school teacher for asking questions at a public school board?
t1_dsjddff	0	*	So now it goes to the problem being the voters. AKA, Republicans.
t1_dsjkhbm	0	*	But we have much less of an us versus them mentality. If a politician screws up, nearly every media outlet will cover it. The culture here is a lot different than in the US.
t1_dskbpas	0	*	But, how is your neighborhood? Can xe0 woman walk freely at night there? 
t1_dsjbgos	0	*	Yeah but everyone should be able to, except violent felons obviously
t1_dskbzys	1	*	This is so accurate. And it makes me so sad that it *is* so accurate. 
t1_dsjjgji	0	*	Im. Not. Defending. Republicans.  
t1_dsjy990	0	*	Where are the numbers for 2017? Also, if you actually go through those one by one you would see that most of those are caused by Balkan biker gangs but I am sure you read all about that. 
t1_du6mltb	0	*	>want_to_join 7 points 1 month ago   >Cobra32233 1 point 4 days ago   That's pure projection, on your part, cobra. Get real.
t1_dsjdrrs	1	*	Yeah, lots of other people grew up enjoying hunting or shooting sports.
t1_dsjd5af	0	*	You're the supposedly dutch person who's defending hillary clinton in 2018, so i don't really understand your eagerness to throw the psychotic addiction card.   
t1_dsjfmq6	1	*	I have never seen this opinion by anyone major on the right. Its not even clear the abssador believes this as well. 
t1_du0f1z9	1	*	I guess on a political spectrum Im a right leaning libertarian so that makes sense. Im against open borders and whatnot and do believe a little bit of nationalism is good for a country. 
t1_du4g6nt	1	*	Well how about that... [Guess I can stop working that hypothetical time machine.](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/7wxvgv/women_gets_kicked_out_of_a_town_hall_in_west/)
t1_dulrqvv	0	*	Dude the average EBT holder makes 40k a year and I moved out here about a decade ago.
t1_dsps2sq	1	*	But Israel never accepted any lines either. It self declared its existence and won a war to defend that declaration.
t1_ds450h9	0	*	Then hold your government responsible. What do you think governments are there to do anyway if not to protect its citizens? To look pretty?
t1_dv78f29	0	*	Minimum wage laws apply to employees.  Uber drivers aren't employees. They are contractors. The don't get a W2 form, they get a 1099.   This isn't an opinion, it's a statement of fact. 
t1_durxvyr	0	*	Amen, brother.    Well, you've restored my faith in humanity for a while.  Take care of yourself
t1_dusu5az	1	*	Well, i agree with all of that. 
t1_duxt3r7	0	*	?????  YOU brought up a source that talked about suicides.  Homicides are less than half what they were.  And you're still ignoring all the other points.
t1_durlzzt	0	*	You'd really give away your second amendment rights?
t1_durlgzv	0	*	Id be interested to see the correlation between gun homicide and use of prescription medications for depression and anxiety. 
t1_durcd3i	0	*	This sounds extremely expensive, should the program work as intended.
t1_durs0fx	0	*	That's why we need massive public support. Make them feel like they'll be voted out if they fail to do something. It starts local and builds from there
t1_durgfqw	1	*	No thanks! I like the state I live in. I have a right as a citizen to influence the political process!
t1_dusmc0w	0	*	Yes, you are an expert on America. Your qualifications are undeniable and we Americans are all a bunch of obtuse morons with no sense of the world... Im learning so much about myself today!
t1_durlagp	0	*	> A non US teenager who plays too much online video games  Dude that is quite possibly the most benign description you could scrounge up for me. Goddamn amateurs.
t1_duslptp	1	*	I listened to you and read a WaPo article on it. So, if that's me not caring, then great. 
t1_duroa0h	1	*	Yeah an auction, that's where I got it. 
t1_dus9rrt	0	*	Yeah. Telling people they should be polite instead of arrogant is the ultimate trolling. 
t1_dus48vb	0	*	He hasn't convinced me of anything. I'm not even that big of a supporter. his love of israel and his tipping on gun control, fuck him. I didn't even vote for him.
t1_dus4vgz	1	*	No. That's the reality that can become when a lot of gun restrictions are put in place.
t1_dusfjux	0	*	What the fuck language are you speaking? Put the crack pipe down bruh
t1_dur97yh	1	*	It would be optional and there would be no obligation to do anything.
t1_durna70	1	*	Youre not a parent are you?
t1_durgmeg	0	*	Youre a perfect example of what Im talking about. 
t1_dtyyarz	0	*	> Yeah, insane might be a generalization. Paranoid schizophrenic is far more accurate.  You think every religious person is a paranoid schizophrenic, eh? That's an outlandish claim.
t1_dv12xc7	0	*	All the hope in the world wont ever make you more brave or well informed than I am... but keep prattling about Hillary, its comical
t1_dt2u7e1	0	*	If you're having to attack me while ignoring my argument we both know who won.
t1_dui2t33	0	*	Yeah I suppose this is a moot point if they can create a wave of nanobots that kill people below a financial threshold lol.
t1_dui1siw	0	*	What a coward.
t1_dujh67l	0	*	Just want to say, I disagree with you being downvoted and think you have been completely reasonable
t1_dui6397	1	*	Im sure there are many many factors that we are unaware of, but that comes down to our system being inept, for whatever reason, and it should be reworked 
t1_dui4lbm	0	*	Sure, but few people have those skills and not every job can be completed remotely
t1_duib7y8	1	*	Well its very crazy 
t1_dui6qth	0	*	For some, yes.   My career, no. I'd also have to purchase a vehicle, as would my SO. Add that to the pile of bills!  There are options everywhere. Doesn't work for everyone though.
t1_duiwafv	0	*	That'd be a guaranteed Tory defeat, they know it is self destructive and would be replaced in an election.  You seem keen on painting the UK as being as shitty as possible.
t1_dui68sl	0	*	If you already know about the 20th century, and still don't see it, I can only conclude that you subscribe to an ideology that precludes it. 
t1_duiiv7z	1	*	Sure. 
t1_duigd76	1	*	Yeah I understand and will definitely support my kids so they can do the same.
t1_dukymsv	0	*	dude, i literally paraphrased my assumption by saying it's an assumption, and i was mostly right anyway, are you going to make a point yet?
t1_dui1f5k	1	*	Fuck off troll. 
t1_du0m644	0	*	What am I having a hard time comprehending? <~ sarcasm   I believe that youre having a difficult time understand that women dont appreciate being oppressed <~ calling you out   Fucking idiot 
t1_dtt4txg	0	*	Youre either ignorant,  or dishonest. 
t1_dttj4ul	0	*	They are not ruled by the Israeli government. They are ruled by the Palestinian Authority.
t1_dttt2kc	1	*	Yes, indeed. Im not sure what point youre making or responding to, however. 
t1_dtt2j51	0	*	Because it is considered conventionally accepted behavior in almost every culture on Earth, specifically in the culture that you draw all your anecdotal evidence from.
t1_dttagyq	1	*	Sorry I misread, I saw Irak (Iran + Seek = Irak lol). My bad 
t1_dsptjtc	0	*	so?  its our duty to speak out.  if you are afraid of speaking your mind, they have already censored you.  ^^just ^^keep ^^making ^^sock ^^puppet ^^accounts
t1_ds2vmuq	1	*	All good man, I feel you. Especially on the topic of bitcoin, it feels like most people who are willing to discuss it are die-hard supporters or haters, you don't see many people on the fence. 
t1_duj68dx	1	*	>  Like GB has ever had a good navy right?  compared to the USN they're a coast guard. the USN dwarfs the next ten navies in strength. but they do have nukes, so that's all a wash.
t1_dsezacd	0	*	And I disagree with that. But that goes against the narrative of hive mind, trump-lovers on the right i guess.
t1_dsexquh	0	*	> http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/aug/16/look-data-domestic-terrorism-and-whos-behind-it/  Since September 12, 2001  Fuck outta here with that shit.
t1_dsfsc3y	0	*	At the time their was nothing directly tied to Trump but the fact that he committed obstruction of justice means A. He's a complete idiot and should not be in office or B. He's hiding something.
t1_dsoad8d	0	*	>It has zero effect on my life.   You haven't been paying attention to the news at all, have you?
t1_dsxqexs	0	*	It came straight from Ri Son-Kwon's mouth. I'll get right on getting KJU to verify that claim for you.  While we're on the topic of sources and evidence I can't help but notice... You have 0?
t1_dtufdfd	0	*	Called it.  Did you even read your own article?
t1_dstux62	0	*	Courage as in angering the public and possibly being assassinated. Look at what happened to Anwar Sadat, King Abdullah of Jordan, and Rabin.  Ehud Barak and Ehud Olmert both offered fair deals.
t1_dss72dv	0	*	You most certainly did misread my reply, as I agreed with your claim that Palestinians as *a* people did not exist until after Zionism.  
t1_dstfdl3	1	*	Cool, i have a stalker.
t1_dunmnjh	1	*	You should try both. It's pretty good.
t1_dup5fd5	0	*	Then much like horse riding you will have to go to private land to do so. Why hold back society for selfish desires? 
t1_dtu7q1s	0	*	Want a fact check?
t1_dttvm5j	0	*	And I bet there are people on the other side of you who feel the exact same way
t1_dttltci	0	*	Ugh. Way to go, I'm immature because I won't roll over for you. Whatever you say, buddy, you win on the internet, good job. 
t1_ds82i9b	1	*	So long as we agree CIA is incompetent. We dont have any arguments here. Good day 
t1_ds8iafm	0	*	The fact you and he have to attack my name, instead of my points, only serves me vindicate me. It shows my point stands.
t1_ds81lzk	0	*	Did I just have a stroke?
t1_dumft40	1	*	You don't like my proff, but at least I have something there. You have none whatsoever, for what is a novel position. Plus, as I've shown, you are an easy liar, so no, you have nothing to say.
t1_duj0gew	0	*	[Are you sure about that?](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3139859/)  And your source is a biased anti-circumcision group with an obvious agenda. Disregarded.
t1_dujrfpd	0	*	Epidemic? That's a bit much.  The rates *are* quite higher. Markedly so.  That's just a fact.  I'm sorry if it somehow upsets you, but I can't temper the facts to suit your worldview. I apologize.
t1_dung9sc	0	*	Yes, in Iceland.  Please celebrate your non-win, if it makes you happy.
t1_dueqylh	0	*	Clearly more than most in this thread. Almost positive I'm the only one who's cited the catechism.
t1_duekz3r	1	*	Yet, they're the ones most likely to give a shit what the Pope thinks and does.
t1_dv0nhzt	0	*	you should go back and edit your comments to hide the proof
t1_duyoemi	1	*	Whatever you say. No need to get all worked up. This is the internet.
t1_duxqnec	1	*	I'm sorry for not knowing all gun laws in a country I do not live in. I concede the final point I made. Do you care to discuss any of the other points made?
t1_duzeohe	0	*	Reality is already out the window when you're talking about a tyrannical US government hell bent on militarily enslaving the population. Why wouldn't WMDs be out of the question? 
t1_duy8foh	1	*	I see you still didnt check out the link. It must be tough basing all your masculinity off a barrel with powder...
t1_duyn4yo	0	*	I just disproved it but ok...
t1_duyydq2	0	*	Are you poisoning the environment by having a net positive carbon footprint?
t1_duz22c8	0	*	No, I don't.  But you are using electricity that they produce, driving cars fueled by their labor and eat food produced using their products.  You are just as culpable.
t1_duyka8m	1	*	I got so triggered. I just had to make a quip about Germany's history. It was the only way I could deal with your comment. What has my life become?
t1_dv7jpk4	0	*	Did i say it had? I just said we don't want it to. 
t1_duxp66u	1	*	I can respect that. Im a bit split on the issue. On one side I think most are easily preventable and on the other I think we should be able to choose.
t1_dv0kkar	1	*	Spot on man.
t1_duyyfsh	0	*	Why? Vichy France was just a puppet government put in place by the Nazis. It's not like the French wanted them there.   And even if you count them, it's STILL not a majority of Europe. 
t1_du91n0n	0	*	Believe what you want, but for anyone reading these comments, less than 90% of Americans have health insurance coverage, not more than.
t1_du9yu0v	1	*	Yup. Insurance companies serve no purpose in the structure of a national health system besides to suck money from every end of the structure.
t1_duawzw0	1	*	I can cherry pick  more things for you. The fact still remains that the liberal government is fine with fossil fuels in the short term. 
t1_ds9pkk8	1	*	In the 1930s, do you think it was acceptable for the Nazis to publish insults and personal attacks against prominent Jews?
t1_dtjss34	0	*	> I still see a conclusion that's based on a number reaching infinity  that's funny, all i see is a mildly funny math joke
t1_dstpgul	0	*	This guy is making me uncomfortable. :S      He keeps claiming I know something secret meme. I have *NO* idea what he is on about.

t1_dspeh2g	0	*	Look, just because you feel like the word endorsement means something else, doesn't make it the case. Google the dictionary meaning which I already provided. You figured out Google yet buddy?

t1_dtf1msz	0	*	Answer the question Steven.
t1_dtfuumy	1	*	What happened when Trump broke the law?

t1_duyfwjy	1	*	Against who?
t1_duxz5m4	0	*	I just realized i didn't know how to spell quatorze.  I've lived my entire life and I think I never had to write it.  For those confused, quatorze (catorze) means fourteen (14)
t1_dv9xi5z	1	*	Happens, once in a while, yeah...
t1_dv5kej4	1	*	Your point accurately represents public development for private interests. Realistically, there is no ethical excuse for ommitting bike lanes in new developments.
t1_dup7jcx	0	*	Welp anyone can see you're more like a shill then I ever will be. Good luck next time.
t1_ds6i687	1	*	Nice ad hominem
t1_ds2x1d0	0	*	Is this what you do instead of admitting you were wrong?
t1_ds56bbg	1	*	I never mentioned Hillary and I didn't deflect to the other side. However I do believe in innocence until proven guilty.
t1_dsm3zek	0	*	I drifted from left to middle to right. It was not a jump from one extreme to another. It was a gradual, deliberate destruction of youthful, fairtale ideals to one based in reality.

t1_dtdw9gx	1	*	Untrue I care about Jewish children

t1_ds6hgn8	0	*	Are you being willfully-obtuse, or do you really not understand the difference between targeted threats and jokes/opinions?
t1_ds6kblg	1	*	That's it in a nutshell. It's why we have a nazi problem again. It's like herpes. The actual nazis may go away but the underlying sentiment that creates them doesn't.
t1_ds6lhhl	0	*	Leave where?  Im not in the US.  Arent US people allowed to advocate for changes in the law in their country?  What is this?
t1_ds79bk7	1	*	What's wrong with compromising situations with sexual undertones? That's like all of tv
t1_ds8kknx	1	*	Yep, them too. IRA, IRS, ABC whoever. 
t1_dsjlhgm	1	*	That's not implied, logically or otherwise.
t1_dsjrbnd	1	*	I can't imagine that in the US you're gonna be able to fine people for not giving notice.  I just don't think that would fly.
t1_dsijm56	0	*	Well no, since they use that power to contest the police rather than a corporation. In this world we make a distinction between a soldier and a crazed gunman.

t1_dsxh8cd	1	*	>Well, you called me a pr type because I mentioned that the blog post author is a fucking movie character.  Did you get confused between accounts?  Or do you guys piggy back off each other?

t1_dsc56aj	0	*	What, over there?
t1_dsce6eo	0	*	True, but EU is still shell shocked from the world wars. They're not actively looking to expansion, unlike Russia.
t1_dseb1zl	0	*	So explain how Vietnam lost the war then.
t1_dsby9ji	1	*	No problem at all. Same to you.
t1_dsca14z	1	*	And the worst of us, apparently.
t1_dsctwrw	1	*	If you do it near the border, but within North Korea, you can stop Chinese troops from crossing over and still avoid that situation.
t1_dscs5b7	0	*	It was the opening rounds of negotiations. The bombs were not necessary. Most of Truman's military command told him this. 
t1_dsc62eo	1	*	Doesn't work like that.

t1_dv05cgy	0	*	Thanks for the link! Like I said, I can't tune in since I don't have any kind of cable. Literally all of my news is consumed through text. 
t1_dv05c05	0	*	Yes, it is all vague and mostly arbitrary. Where do you think those population numbers came from if not the census?
t1_dv0bhsz	0	*	The fighting will be done by mass migration and father time, there is nothing to stop the postcultural takeover of your heritage
t1_dv077t4	0	*	nice inherent superiority in intelligence because I am liberal argument  nyt, wapo, ap, npr, vice are all fake news. not cnn though. thats very fake news.  t. math phd
t1_dv02l8r	1	*	>That's the thing...how many black South Africans are aspiring to become landowning farmers anyway?    Agreed, I think the same way on this. It's just tribalism. It most likely won't end well.
t1_duzzcqc	1	*	Voluntary? Yeah that's def what the 13th amendment says. As long as the prisoner consents, it's ok to work them for extremely low wages.

t1_dv1wlz6	0	*	If you wanna get technical, sure, theres an analogy. All I meant was that it is a very weak one.
t1_duzys3a	0	*	Foreign business can pressure them. China's is dependent the their unspoken capitalist economy and the growth it is fueling. However XI is pro foreign investment so it's unlikely to happen.
t1_duzxx5r	0	*	Besides, living in the ghetto does not justify nor rationalize commiting crime. Honest work is the best way for both the individual and the collective.

t1_dt7dqqk	0	*	Korean and Japanese and Chinese cross over one way or the other, but I think Korean and Chinese have more aspects in common than Japanese would have with the other two.

t1_dt7iaem	1	*	how can you be so stupid that you don't even believe your own sources
t1_dt7atj1	0	*	No youve got it all wrong. Indo-european is still one single language family with many sub families. Mutual intelligibility has nothing to do with how you categorize language families.

t1_dt7fw9o	1	*	All-righty then.
t1_dt7ksb7	1	*	Yes, and they have to have the resources to move, as well.  I imagine very few North Koreans would even have the money to even get a bus ticket to the south.
t1_dt7drov	1	*	100% sure it's saved. I'm looking at it now.

t1_dsh65nf	0	*	I'm very ok with it because most Palestinians killed were terrorists. This was a civilian who killed a civilian. Hamas is not an army. They are a terror group.

t1_dseud36	0	*	I would never invite anybody to Brussels since I am really not as cruel as you are making me out to be. 
t1_du3o0f5	1	*	Already have in another comment chain.
t1_du1sq0z	0	*	Nah I said I didn't bother to back it up.   We can at most claim that we are unsure.  However, you have claimed that my assertion is false. For that, you need to back it up. 
t1_ducb6mg	1	*	Cute. 
t1_dstxqco	0	*	Nah, it's knowing what your buying. The community, potential problems, who the devs are, stuff like that. 
t1_duyfc8j	0	*	> You're just another typical leftist,  Mueller is a Republican. Rosenstein is a Republican.  You try so hard and you're failing so miserably.
t1_duygu7u	0	*	They couldn't recount the votes in the precincts where the vote totals didn't match.  That was 37% of Detroit's precincts.
t1_dv36xrz	0	*	Do have any evidence that doesn't require the use of my imagination?
t1_dsqv807	1	*	How much do you need to carry on this daunting expedition to Barcelona?  It's hardly beating a path through the Amazon.

t1_dsr0ifj	1	*	Updooted
t1_dsqwl2b	1	*	Absolutely not, but they are cool just like cathedrals. Again, I just think these get boring after a while
t1_dss8nce	0	*	If by smarter, you mean score higher on IQ tests, then yes that is what every large study shows. Are you a science denier? 
t1_ds3j096	0	*	It literally says edit at the bottom of the comment. Stop being an idiot. 
t1_dtoazdu	0	*	So you would rather see Russia or China take up the mantle?   
t1_dtp0izs	1	*	Do you really see that the outcome of Argentina or Chile (your examples, not mine) are similar to Crimea? That's the point - the outcomes are *not* the same.
t1_dtoqhma	0	*	How exactly are those figures relevant to the point your trying to make?   Your inability to think critically is showing.
t1_dtq3q3f	1	*	Well she came up with it in a very simple way, wanted to get something checked, called in and asked for a visit, got told she has to wait 2-3 months 
t1_dtooaox	0	*	It has absolutely changed. The situation got worse.
t1_dtolqu8	0	*	I appreciate that insight. I would think that it is mostly bullshit, though. Even the most refined pallette can't tell the difference between a sparkling wine and a champaign.
t1_dtoaqhh	0	*	I'm not sure how to make it clearer. Russia invades and annexes its neighbors. The US does espionage. They are not the same. 
t1_du9pz52	1	*	Touche'
t1_duaxjr8	1	*	I dont really care too, still amusing though. 
t1_du8dfvy	1	*	Hallelujah, someone that sees my point. Off to buy a lotto ticket! Appreciate your words, and the courage to post them. Cheers.

t1_dv38il4	0	*	And yes the 3 million votes didn't matter because of the ELECTORAL COLLEGE. I said this before but your thick skull prevented you from getting this information into your soft, tiny brain.

t1_dv2qov1	0	*	> financee's military care  So you wanted socialized medical care. TriCare is a socialist construct, taking large subsidies from the taxpayer to make it affordable for those who serve.

t1_dv3l903	0	*	Hey man youre the one begging reddit for advice because you have no experience in financials then turning around and trying to pretend you know what the fuck youre talking about.  Hahaha   Hahhahahaha

t1_dtur5q3	0	*	What do you think of your own country political scene?
t1_dtvs82c	0	*	Yes, they seize things from people... They don't walk into stores and take money from the resister. Stop being deliberately obtuse. 
t1_dsj3btw	0	*	> I don't really feel like arguing with you any more  This wasnt even an argument. this was an explanation of why you are wrong.
t1_dtiqo3v	0	*	Again, not racist as Palestinians aren't a race. You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.
t1_dtj6iah	0	*	Not a answer. I admit I am 100% biased of a nation that breaks internation law.   Also, they are second class citizens in Israel. 
t1_dtl4urp	0	*	Lol, he's not racist. You just want to label people racist in order to discredit their arguments. GTFO.
t1_dthjm7d	1	*	Im glad you think this makes israel look shitty though. I agree. They are!
t1_duvwp6f	1	*	Im 100% down 
t1_duw295y	0	*	Kinda makes you wanna do the ole we tried boys then everyone puts a .45 in their mouth and let the hammer drop. 
t1_duyukbq	0	*	No. The only thing that matters is how much have you already put out there, in total.   http://www.wri.org/sites/default/files/uploads/historical_emissions.png

t1_dux15mv	0	*	page 14 & 15
t1_ds22gbk	0	*	What is with the rationalizing here? The charter clearly says the day of judgement wont come until Muslims kill the Jews.   Again, thats Jews in general. Not Israelis, nor even Israeli Jews.
t1_ds2ofix	1	*	So I'm right and you've just made thay conclusion up? Alright.
t1_dtuacyz	0	*	There are. But to call farm attacks Genocide just cheapens the word immensely. 
t1_dt30muk	0	*	No, but you might get more upvotes if you weren't so insanely daft.  Keep it up, sport. I'm rooting for you.  
t1_dt2nxi5	1	*	I was also here
t1_dt2wucq	0	*	Are you seriously asking that?
t1_dt2nesv	1	*	Amen.
t1_dt30t87	0	*	That's called faith and faith is for the foolish.
t1_dt2qv54	0	*	Ah the old Reddit Schrxf6dingeroo 
t1_dt2wev6	0	*	Its one of them, but yes the main one for me currently.      Prose and poetry, as a genre, has multi-layered meanings and beauty that arises every time you read/study them, dont you agree?         
t1_dt2n7s6	0	*	>You can be a scientist and believe in God without cognitive dissonance. They are not necessarily mutually exclusive.  Did you actually read my post? That's not what I said *at all*.
t1_duvge01	1	*	Hey, I'm just taking the time I don't have to let in you on the secret.
t1_dsc929t	1	*	Lack of belief doesn't exist.
t1_dsc90nh	0	*	And how can you trust the sources you just posted? I appreciate you going through the trouble of looking those up but they aren't right.
t1_dsbf6n6	1	*	Yes it was.
t1_dsbblpx	0	*	Your poem sucks. You should focus on speaking out against Muslims who dont tolerate your existence more than anything else.
t1_dscfi93	0	*	> Correlation does not imply causation.  You're the one insisting that religion causes all kinds of bad outcomes on the basis of correlation. 
t1_dtr5vci	1	*	I just followed your profile. This thread is not viewable without a direct link or by viewing your profile.
t1_dtqfmrx	0	*	Nah, found it organically. You're just whining and looking for any excuse to not actually engage in discussion because you've been thoroughly debunked.
t1_dtqam0d	0	*	By one democrat who was as learned about this issue as you seem to be?  
t1_dtr7ogk	1	*	*Eugh*
t1_dtqwkno	1	*	But again, that isnt the discussion here.  It was argued a merit based system similar to Canadas wouldnt work cause low skilled workers are in high demand..
t1_dtqlyo5	0	*	Go back to your safe space, troll.
t1_dt9891t	0	*	Or are some cultures simply immoral? It's not necessarily the morality that changes.
t1_dtezbqe	0	*	How does something being natural make it moral? Morallity is completely separate from what goes on in nature.
t1_dsf8h5l	0	*	Look man. NN was overblown. Fear, panic and frustation was uncalled for.  Read this: https://reason.com/blog/2017/11/26/why-net-neutrality-was-mistaken-from-the

t1_dv50kwt	1	*	This sounds very reasonable.
t1_dsvgyk8	1	*	>Sorry, the quesiton should have been why is that bad?  Are you asking why rampant inflation is bad?  >No. Rich people.  Again you need to get your ducks in a square before you circle that row.
t1_dufsdi4	1	*	i belong to thinking fellers union local 282, what organization pays your internet access bills?
t1_du5eans	1	*	That is true. China has always been astonishingly arrogant. Sometimes delusionally so.  Source: The Opium Wars; the first in particular. 
t1_du5ixxn	0	*	King Leopold II of Belgium's lovely charitable organization that caused untold deaths in the Congo, including half a million starved to death.   That was up to 1908 so part of the 20th century.   
t1_du5ipzf	0	*	Ah yes, because the current German government, which has explicit bans on any extreme parties which advocate violence, is the exact same as Stalinist Russia or Hitler's Reich
t1_du5cou1	0	*	You actually believe that America does not have restraining orders? 
t1_dt1xsd9	0	*	Do you care about everything?
t1_dtexxd0	1	*	Ladies and gentleman, I give you the modern day leftist. Ignore your argument in favor of name calling and then disregard you completely.
t1_dtd9n36	0	*	Only a stupid person gives out those details to people who call them stupid. What should I concern myself with if not the most powerful man ruling the most powerful nation in the history of the world?
t1_dtbxwvk	0	*	Under the header, what's wrong with section 702
t1_dtbrpmt	0	*	So you don't give a shit about the overall health of your democracy, but hey you'll be able to afford that *NEW CAR!* I guess President Bonespurs really does play to his base.
t1_dtbru9y	0	*	Are you a troll?
t1_dtc6wv5	0	*	So which was it: were you just confused about the DOW over last 5 years or were you intentionally trying to be dishonest?
t1_dtboj38	0	*	And yet here you are, jerking yourself off about how much you don't care in a post where you try way too hard to insert yourself in someone else's conversation for other no reason.
t1_dtcdwna	0	*	You did a much better job than me. Thanks. 
t1_dsvr0sk	0	*	Wealth is unconscionable if only very few people have it.
t1_dsobk16	0	*	nope :) All liberals are brainwashed by the media right? It's nice to be free of the burden of independence. It certainly never happens in reverse though. No propaganda ever comes from the right.
t1_dso2ckq	0	*	That's clear. What's also clear is that we cannot attribute the current economy to Trump. 
t1_dsoasmf	0	*	Again, not relevant, but thanks for playing
t1_dsnowe4	1	*	>  A democrat spent eight years getting our economy back  Thanks Bush!
t1_dsn8go1	0	*	Hey this asshole aggravated them so much that we needed to talk to them to avoid nuclear winter.
t1_dsn8n4a	0	*	Because youre ignoring the world. Youre burying your head in the sand because youre house isnt on fire. Its childish and idiotic.  Where exactly can you cash in a 401k in a post nuclear hellscape?
t1_dsnh5xu	0	*	Its a free country, but youre lazy.
t1_dsndlwy	0	*	Well, if you want a direct answer, since you aren't satisfied with those, how about the fact that he withdrew the USA from the 2015 Paris Accords? Climate change affects all of the world negatively. 
t1_dso65nn	0	*	Lol uh huh
t1_dsqhdcy	0	*	What does you being an architect have to do with anything? Do you think all structures require architects ?
t1_dsq0niy	1	*	You can vary around an 1/16th-1/8th usually but sometimes it's up to a quarter, more so when dealing with pressure treated. 
t1_ds5cgj3	1	*	You don't have arguments, you have vague gut feelings. 
t1_dt92hkc	1	*	Yeah, but we let all those displaced Hindus reclaim their homes in Pakistan! And all the Germans moved back to Poland! Israel, so evil! 
t1_dt9ozd8	0	*	>Essentially there are 3 important players in the troubles between Israeli and Palestinians.  I only count two: Israel and Palestine.  > So what the president of the US does is relevant.  How so?

t1_dsaudzi	0	*	>It's not like the Palestinians had more of a right to that area than the Israelis.  It's not like you have more of a right to your house than me.
t1_dsb9nvz	0	*	Most of the Palestinians living in what is today Israel too. The difference is that the previous Palestinian population of Israel was huge and the previous Jewish population of Palestine was small.
t1_dsagmi7	0	*	solutions catered to a specific problem are always better than blanket ones.  saying other people have it rough is not an excuse for inaction.  
t1_dsalvdn	1	*	If you're talking about some other video where he said that then I would concede the point. But I'm pretty sure the trial is for the pug one.
t1_dsae0nb	0	*	That's a crime and a horrible tragedy. Again, thanks for the link.   Yet I still don't like the logic of they did crime x 40ish years ago, so we can do crime x now.
t1_dsdhq3g	0	*	You're not paraphrasing you're searching my comment history for something to take out of context and prove what a moron you are, and you succeeded.
t1_dtnms4i	0	*	When you start going on about religious bullshit, you're exactly like they are... You're just pissed off they believe differently than you do. This is hypocrisy. You're a hypocrite.
t1_dtnoirz	0	*	I stopped reading at because in Genesis...   *shakes head*
t1_dspqgjk	0	*	What specifically did I lie about earlier?? I still am confused. I admit I worded what I said earlier a bit weirdly, that may have caused the confusion between the two of us.

t1_duo8miy	0	*	Fucking liar this guy is. Stfu 
t1_dupnt9s	0	*	Because the value vs cost isn't there for me.  It is like if someone proposed making hate speech illegal because it could save lives.  The value of freedom is more than the cost in lives.    
t1_duog34e	0	*	That was just what I saw on reddit, I didn't really do any good research.
t1_duqbpt1	0	*	It doesn't take much to find plenty of incidents across the US where intruders broke in and the resident had to defend themselves. Likely doesn't make a victim suffer less damage when it happens. 
t1_duo2o2t	0	*	So, you mean a private sale?
t1_duodx7m	0	*	How do you propose this? Theres not a law besides outright banning all firearms that will keep one out of someones hands. Legally, you just cant.   
t1_dtjh52v	1	*	Well, I mean you cared enough to respond me.
t1_dtifne9	0	*	At this point I'm thinking it's just because it's Trump. I mean I hate him as well, but I'm not going to blame him for enjoying a hobby. 
t1_dtior65	0	*	So nevermind the fact that every president blows smoke up everyone's ass and then screws them. Fuck Trump amirite? Maybe it's a systemic issue and not a circle-jerk for some karma?

t1_dtijhul	0	*	What secret service accommodations do they have to pay for?
t1_dtj73t7	1	*	Nope, nothing else(as far as we know).  Abnormal protein leads to progressive insomnia which leads to death. 
t1_dti1c3z	0	*	Why? This is about their actions, not skin color.  Are you Russian? Thats why this offends you so much. Go drink some vodka and salute a picture of Putin.
t1_dth5jw4	0	*	no no no. i accused you of defending Putin and *then* i looked at your post history.   you can't get anything right today...
t1_dtiwhir	0	*	Nope, I singled out all Russians flooding reddit as trolls. You're too slow to understand it.  Its based on NOTHING. You're making it up.

t1_ds2ctqh	1	*	I think I kinda want it! 
t1_ds27sdm	1	*	What's ironic? You didn't catch my sarcasm originally and personally attacked me calling me an asshole and stupid. so of course I'd attack you back. 
t1_ds4bqy6	1	*	Autocorrect, obviously.  And lol. Keep up the circlejerk.
t1_du5ysn9	0	*	Dude where do you get your weed?
t1_du5xwxx	1	*	Yeah, but your original point is still plainly incorrect. See my other response. 
t1_du6h6hg	0	*	So he deserved to die simply because of the circumstances of his birth.  Comrade Dutch.. Is that you?  Maybe you should go back to playing Paradox games and grow up a bit more little buddy. 
t1_ds8ogm1	1	*	Alright I don't understand you but it doesn't matter. Let's just shake on it. No point in arguing with each other lol.

t1_dsde0pz	0	*	Good point! I wonder if that would make a difference in vegans, if pain or discomfort is what they want to eliminate
t1_dutage1	0	*	There has been 12 cases of voter fraud in the last 20 years. Why change the laws so that people have to show Id to vote when it's obviously not a big deal in the first place? I'm really curious. 
t1_dszmyv6	0	*	In the comment before you just said that would be throwing money away? 
t1_dt1h0au	0	*	don't cut yourself on that edge brah.
t1_dt19gm0	0	*	Yes, you're definitely blind. Blind to every part of an argument you want to ignore.  Why don't you properly summarise my argument and try again.

t1_dtiq2ih	1	*	thx for the reminder that everyone is a user in a way, not that person that some percieve to be a bum
t1_dtjdy7s	0	*	I said fuck you buddy. 
t1_dtj4ovm	1	*	Yes, and taking away the privilege of sleeping in a park bench won't make them, or anything that happens to be a coincidence of them existing (used needles for example), go away

t1_dtnz3gm	0	*	Come on man I'm not going to keep repeating it, just reread what I wrote, the fact that the law firm worked for a political party was far from being the only issue. 
t1_dtoehhp	0	*	Jesus Christ dude you are pathetic.
t1_dto5hjb	0	*	So the two groups who are the accused say that they are innocent and we should believe them, why?

t1_dtoz2ws	0	*	Just gonna assume you'd gladly let Donald Trump squat down and drop a huge dump in your mouth for you to chew on. You clearly have trouble denying it.
t1_dtfs64p	1	*	>They you have civil discord, friend  Apologies friend. The typo is making it hard for me to understand what you are saying. Mind editing it? I'm sure that won't affect your account oppression.

t1_dsqni40	0	*	Are you done with the mental breakdown?
t1_dsp6tq3	0	*	Air Bud 2
t1_dss421j	1	*	You have no idea about the actions of your country. 
t1_dssjnn9	0	*	Your response presupposes that anyone has, or had, a way to deal with it.
t1_dsrsqiq	0	*	Still shows up on my end.  Maybe your shit is as retarded as you are.  Sad!
t1_dss4ae0	0	*	well, duh.  Which is why most people thought Trump was better than Hillary. Because he was an outsider U0001f602
t1_dstcg42	0	*	> f I have to explain it only proves me right.  Please, explain. 
t1_dsrpe3b	0	*	Right, because it belongs to the Samsung family
t1_dss6qlx	0	*	There's a difference between net worth and net worth + brand worth.
t1_dsrzwgk	1	*	So he denounces it explicitly, then adds there was violence on both sides and fine people on both sides, and your conclusion is that he did not denounce white supremacy. Got it. 
t1_dsmkw8o	0	*	Yeah I feel sorry that he is going to have to share a world with someone like you cheers. Edit* word
t1_dsl2zdn	0	*	I understand your pain but honestly, we're not here to educate you, we're just here to snigger at you ( there is much sniggering going on )
t1_dslx0fr	0	*	>The actual party leadership is corrupt as hell just like the GOP.  Nowhere near the same.   Or are you going to bust out the old BUT TEH PRIMARY WAS RIGGED nonsense?
t1_dskz61d	1	*	Have a great weekend, and next time think *before* typing, to save everyone the trouble. 
t1_dslapyz	0	*	My comments are still up, but it says your's are removed. If I was at my computer I'd post it, but all the animosity aside, that is weird. 
t1_dsltbpx	1	*	Ok, so now a blue screen has come up. Something about a BIOS bug?.. My computer won't start. My computer is my baby, pls help
t1_dsliyo1	0	*	Yep. Youre spot on as a liberal, would not have expected less. You should go back to college and get a different degree. 
t1_dslmg68	0	*	Lol you told me not to speculate on the economy, and then you speculate on the presidents future. So maybe dont be so quick to judge the future of the President based on your feelings U0001f609
t1_dsl4mxd	0	*	Lol, I love the projection, crybaby, but what I'd really love is for you to be intellectually curious enough to research stuff without me telling you to!
t1_dslo8gw	0	*	I told you you would hurt yourself L O L
t1_dsmmqak	0	*	Any news I dont like is fake. Lol you people are sad and insane

t1_dstrpbc	0	*	You sure showed google spell check,I'm assuming their stock is dropping as we speak 
t1_duqeuzx	0	*	Oh, sorry, I mean America.  Did you mean Italy?
t1_dupc0ia	0	*	Because there is nothing wrong with being American, white, black, or Jewish.  There is a lot of things wrong with promoting intolerance and attempting to implement evidently harmful ideology.
t1_dup2p28	0	*	O Look. Another devils advocate, but only for the fascist one. Yea, I thought so.
t1_dups9jq	0	*	Dude literally cant be reasoned with even in the face of literal facts. He only understand punches to the face!!!!!!!!! Boo Hitler sucks!!
t1_dsalzyy	0	*	Let's not pretend you ever had a grasp on it
t1_dulqf22	0	*	Well since the sentiment still exists it's good enough we'll let it happen again, we will get outraged for some time and keep on with our lives.
t1_duljux2	0	*	rofl, it's china. if it doesn't hit a million, it's pennies.
t1_duls4rj	0	*	It's clear to me that it's the primary reason.
t1_dumc020	0	*	Yeah dude, like before the crusades.  WTF?  Also, are you lumping the entire Islamic world together as one entity?  
t1_dum3e9u	1	*	Thanks
t1_dumu9ic	1	*	I follow a lot of australian personalities. Jim jeffries, ozzy man reviews to name a few. And a big fan of the dude who punched a kangaroo to save his dog. Hahaa
t1_duma1nv	0	*	When was the last time Monaco fought an Asian land war? When did Jamaica last get bombed? 
t1_duluvax	0	*	Well. They were both fighting the same opponent, both had an overwhelming advantage over their enemy, and both suffered far less casualties then their adversary but still decided to withdraw.
t1_dum56rl	0	*	Although now the US is Nazi Germany except theres a genocide on the working class and not the jews 
t1_dumbtil	1	*	do you got any evidence to back this up or are you just talking out of your ass?
t1_dulymmj	0	*	I didn't say anything about which country.  We are talking about the US government arming it's enemies.
t1_dun1i7k	0	*	So how does that make any western nation better than the states? 
t1_dumc7nv	0	*	It was.
t1_duaypvw	1	*	Firing a tank gun however 
t1_dud6evv	0	*	I grew up in a different time and a different place. So I dont necessarily agree with this sentiment, but I will say that there needs to be something done to limit crazies with access to guns.
t1_duakeka	1	*	But if that kid didnt have a gun it is very very likely noone would have died, and do not fucking fallback to knives bs.
t1_dud6ktp	1	*	>  dramatically as well as suicides across the board.  No they didn't.  Homicide rates in Australia have dropped at the same rate as those of the US over the same period of time.
t1_dua84n9	0	*	> Violent crime is at an all time low in this country  It seems it has been [increasing](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/25/us/violent-crime-murder-chicago-increase-.html)  lately though.
t1_dua6wiq	0	*	Not where I live mate.
t1_dschis3	0	*	Calling a bigot a bigot is not name calling. Just like calling a panda a panda is not name calling.   Or calling an African American and African American.   Troll harder maybe? 
t1_dsc4iz6	1	*	Argument is that islam really isn't different from christanity, am ok with people calling out issues with whatever but it's just the rhetoric of some people
t1_dscakwi	0	*	See my other post, it appears you didn't read the rest of the article, either that or you didn't interpret it properly. It's okay buddy it happens.
t1_dscdu00	1	*	You too. ;)
t1_dsbyigg	0	*	Not more or less than other religions or ideologies. Humans are aggressive, if we get rid of one excuse we find another.
t1_dsch53o	0	*	That's not how logic works. Ad Hominem is attacking a person's character to discredit their argument. I discredited your argument and then attacked your character. 
t1_dscliqg	1	*	Nice adjective! Have a pleasant evening internet stranger.
t1_dscg67w	1	*	Why would they go for the US when they have Western Europe right next to them? Africans speak english so their preffered options are Anglospheric countries naturally.
t1_dsc5rz5	0	*	They also eat little kids and invented communism. U0001f602
t1_dscycg2	0	*	Being terrified of newborns is rational?

t1_dsxb6e2	1	*	Agreed. 
t1_dscnb8s	0	*	> During this period, the Muslims showed a strong interest in assimilating the scientific knowledge of the civilizations **that had been conquered.**
t1_dsd7qu0	0	*	It seems arbitrary to draw a line at a certain % point and then ban ppl above it but not below.  Also, you forgot to answer my other points. 
t1_dukc1yb	0	*	So?  That doesn't mean they're a good idea.
t1_dukfiek	0	*	Credit and thank are fucking synonymous you shit eating troll. The fucking Thesaurus says thank and credit are the same. Fucking Reddit and its army of ignorant assfucks. 
t1_duksxdb	1	*	Well if we're just saying every existing insect starts growing massive... We're all gonna get eaten by grand daddy long legs since their mouths will be big enough to bite us now.
t1_dtgv94n	1	*	And that's the problem with buying your meat from a grocery store. We buy our meat from our neighbors and butcher shops where its all free range and killed on property.
t1_dtgzzuu	0	*	I've suddenly gone from mildly amused by you to profoundly saddened.  
t1_dthdvub	1	*	No, because you think that those people cannot do anything wrong since they're not breaking the law, so why wouldn't you be friends with them?
t1_dt41o78	1	*	These are people who have never known the country their parents came from. It's cruel and wrong to kick them out of the only country they have ever known. Do you just lack empathy?
t1_dupuulm	0	*	Direct quote  > and inneficiencies in the system such as maintaining and sharing records between hospitals, doctors, and insurance providers (another thing the White House is finally working on).
t1_duq5rna	0	*	All European countries are exactly the same when you're an ignorant fool. 
t1_durocpn	1	*	If you are extrapolating from a single high point and ignoring everything else prior, fine, but you'll get shitty numbers.
t1_duqi93i	0	*	This is a perfect example of a strawman + red herring. Throwing an irrelevant issue into the mix because you can't prove your shitty ideology. 
t1_dupt4bi	0	*	The only thing I could find was that Trump is trying to overhaul the VA medical record system. Is that what you are referring to? 
t1_dupwv06	0	*	Well, you would then expect the issue is solved easily and quickly. Nope.
t1_duq626n	0	*	Yeah I know what Marxism is. Its a belief set based on fantasy, it rejects reality and thats the basis of its failing. Just like socialism is in an economic sense. Youre a disease.
t1_dur2x30	0	*	what is your country if i may ask? The US has an insurance problem. I admit universal health care would be more preferable for me based on our spending.
t1_dupygvw	0	*	Ah yes better to just stuff it in the ground and hope for the best gotcha!  Idiot.
t1_dtndllc	1	*	Amazing.
t1_dtoy42m	0	*	> The full dossier has been online for at least a month.  Really? Show please.

t1_dtn2rs6	0	*	Can you provide sources? These are claims I am not familiar with. 
t1_dtndmje	1	*	Okay, you're too silly to talk to.
t1_dt80n1a	0	*	If you want to suggest to someone fair reporting of the trump administration, try the news 
t1_dt8auby	0	*	Your juvenile personal attacks don't do you or your religion any favors
t1_dt6m4g3	0	*	And I'm back.   Bread with things on is and forever shall be *** a sandwich!***
t1_dt7iqnf	0	*	Also lol @ implying I need help with my math when you dont recognize a p of 0.124 isnt statistically significant. 
t1_dugq9re	0	*	Oh yeah, because I'm sure the illiterate farmers the USA is at war with currently will be able to cause soooooo many causalities once the troops get back home.  Are you for real?
t1_dugphxk	0	*	Also - Im reading through the platform and seeing nothing about the adoption thing.  Im not saying its not there, Im just saying I cant seem to find it.  Do you have the specific quote?
t1_duhuepf	0	*	It was packed partly because of russian influence. Their influence was extremely large on how the electors were thinking. They got Trump to be elected ffs. 
t1_duh2vng	0	*	That's a straw man. There's a difference between holding a CEO responsible for things the office they hold as CEO does and the things the company that office is a part of does. 
t1_dugvkd4	0	*	Did I not prove that?
t1_dugrwfl	0	*	I doubt that they're a Russian shillbot. I think they might just be really dense, obtuse, and pretty stupid person.
t1_dugrs69	1	*	Nvmd. I take that back. O read the rest of his stuff and where he posts. 
t1_duh2pu4	1	*	If they use the account to ever at all talk about things related to their job, as Trump does all day everyday, no absolutely not.
t1_duix529	0	*	You are a low information tool who deals in nothing but sound bites. 
t1_duh55fs	1	*	Sorry, which ones, the small or large, but my answer is yes either way?
t1_dugr1h9	1	*	Idk. I think this one is a real person. Dumn and uninformed. But honest. 
t1_dugqgpd	0	*	\>russian shillbot  \>thousands of posts on gaming subreddits  yikes, liberals really have lost it
t1_durs4ky	0	*	U0001f611
t1_duh3o4u	0	*	Needs universal reform, which won't happen.
t1_dugp586	0	*	Have you ever heard the saying never argue with an idiot, they just drag you down to their level?
t1_duia1jy	0	*	Sorry you feel that way, pal -- but congrats on making politics a worse place. It's a shame we can't have a live-and-let-live attitude and respectfully disagree with each other. 
t1_dugtwlb	1	*	Like arguing about physics with a goat.
t1_duh6ztb	1	*	How?  He couldn't even beat Hillary, and we hear no end to how terrible a candidate she was.
t1_dugt66t	0	*	Yeah, I do. Hillary got more votes, and if the DNC had gone ahead and still selected Bernie like you said, it would have been rigged in his favor.

t1_dudtnb5	0	*	there is nothing wrong with american cheese
t1_dubzpvd	1	*	I guess we disagree on both counts then and maybe so does China and the West, thank god we have the WTO to mediate and come to a decision then.
